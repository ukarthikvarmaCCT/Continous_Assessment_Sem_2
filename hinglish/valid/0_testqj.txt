 In England in the first half of the 18th century the number of books published in a year was 93
 20veen sadi ke pehle 25 saalon main prati varsh ausat 600 kitaaben prakashit hui
 This growth shows why the era of expertise came

 england main penguin or pelican ne sampadan kaa str unchaa rakhaa or america main sasti pustakon ke prakashkon ne moulik pustaken bhi chhapana shu degree kiya
 The expertise of publishing led to the birth of two new professions for arranging manuscripts for publication

 He works under contract with the publisher and gets 1 or 2 percent commission on the retail price
 doosraa he litereri agent
 He works with writers and has full responsibility for the relationship of the writer to the publisher

 The next effect of this agency's tendency was that the publisher was no longer just a manager and handed over the editing work to others
 isse lekhakon, visheshat: kathakaron, kaa bazaar bhi badha
 In the 20th century, the rights of film publishing, rights of drama, rights of drama, radio, television rights, summary rights and many other rights were also included in the journals

 Some would have included books along with other things they had advertised
 kuch keval pustakon kaa vigyaapan karti thim
 The publisher also needed a lot of intelligence and experience to spend up to 8-10 per cent of the cost in advertising, which the publishers did not have
 yahi kaaran tha pustak vyavsaay main vigyaapan agency vyavsaay ke aagaman kaa
 It is that while most books are commercial books, publication of other types of books is also going on
 masalan, vishvavidhyalayon dwaara prakashit pustaken, vigyaan kii pustaken aadi
 Sophistication in the art of printing also had an impact on the publishing business

 Most of these originated in the early 20th century

 On that day of Shivaratri, his entire family stayed in a temple for night awakening

 He saw that the rats were eating the bhog kept for Shivji

 This is your gurudakshina
 unhone aashirwad diya ki ishwar unke purusharth ko safal kare
 He gave the final teachings - Manuscripts condemn God and Rishis, not Rishikrit texts

 It is difficult to prove the full benevolence and intent of mutual interaction without leaving it

 The rules and principles of Arya Samaj are for the welfare of the pranamatra

 i believe that there is nothing wrong in the Gita
 iske alaava gita vedon ke khilaaf nahin he
 There is no other scriptural evidence except the Vedas - to propagate this truth, Swamiji started visiting the whole country and wherever he went, the pandits and scholars of the ancient tradition gave up on him
 sanskrit bhashaa kaa unhen agaadh gyaan tha
 He was fluent in Sanskrit
 saath hi ve prachand taarkik the
 He studied the Christian and Muslim scriptures thoroughly
 atev akele hi unhone teen-teen morchon par sangharsh aarambh kar diya
 The two fronts were of Christianity and Islam, but the third front was of Sanatanadharmi Hindus, in which Swamiji had to face many insults, stigmas and sufferings
 dayanand ne buddhivaad kii jo mashaal jalaayee thi, uskaa koi jawaab nahin tha
 Neither Muslims nor Christians, nor Hindu scholars and scholars who follow the Puranas could answer what they were saying
 hindu navotthana ab puure prakaash main aa gaya tha or anek samajhadaar log man hi man anubhav karne lage the ki vastav main puranic dharm kii pongapathi main koi saar nahin he
 Swamiji strongly contradicted the evils prevalent in the prevailing religions, whether it was Sanatan Dharma or Islam or Christianity
 apane mahagranth satyarth prakaash main swamiji ne sabhi maton main vyaapt buraaiyon kaa khandan kiya he
 Unlike his contemporary reformers, Swamiji's opinion was not limited to the educated class but the Arya Samaj also attracted the ordinary masses of Aryavarta
 san 1872 i
 main swami ji kalakatta padhaare
 There Devendranath Thakur and Keshav Chandra Sen gave him a big welcome
 brahmo samaajiyon se unka vichaar-vimarsh bhi hua kintu isiyat se prabhavit brahmo samaji vidwaan punarjanm or veda kii pramanikta ke vishay main swami se ekamat nahin ho sake
 It is said that in Calcutta itself, Keshav Chandra Sen advised Swamiji that if you leave Sanskrit and start speaking in Aryabhasa, then there can be immense favor of the country
 tabhi se swami ji ke vyakhyanon kii bhashaa aryabhasha ho gayi or aryabhashi praanton main unhe aganit anuyaayi milane lage
 Swamiji came to Mumbai from Calcutta and on 10 April 1875, he founded the 'arya Samaj'
 mumbai main unke saath prarthana samaaj waalon ne bhi vichaar-vimarsh kiya
 But this society was a Mumbai version of Brahmo society
 atev swami ji se is samaaj ke log bhi ekamat nahin ho sake
 Swamiji came to Indraprastha after returning from Mumbai
 vahaan unhone satyanusndhan ke liye isai, musalmaan or hindu panditon kii ek sabha bulaayi
 But even after two days of deliberations, people could not reach any conclusion
 indraprastha se swami ji punjab gaye
 a lot of enthusiasm arose in Punjab and Aryasamaj branches started opening up all over the province

 Maharishi Dayanand was trying to establish unity by bringing all the religious leaders on one platform
 unhone indraprastha darbar ke samay 1878 main aisa prayaas kiya tha
 His fundamental ideas in his immortal treatise Satyarth Prakash, Sanskar Vidhi and Rigvedadi Bhasya are clearly attainable

 He was in favor of participation of all varnas and women in social restructuring
 rashtriya jaagran kii disha main unhone saamaajik kranti tathaa aadhyatmik punarutthan ke maarg ko apanaaya
 The foresight, patriotism and pragmatism displayed in his education concepts are completely relevant and contemporary
 maharishi dayanand samaaj sudhaarak tathaa dharmik punarjagran ke pravartak to the hi, ve prachand rashtravaadi tathaa rajnatik adarshavaadi bhi the
 Due to the state of foreigners being in the Aryavarta, there are differences, differences, no consumption of celibacy, reading and studying the law and self-immolation in childhood, sensuality, false language, kulakshan, propagation of Vedas, etc
 are misdeeds
 The brothers fight and then the third foreigner comes and becomes a punch
 unhone rajdhyaksh tathaa shashan kii vibhinn parishadon evam samitiyon ke liye aavashyak yogyataon ko bhi ginaya he
 He favored the system of justice based on sage pranit texts
 swami dayanand saraswati ko saamanyat: keval arya samaaj ke sansthaapak tathaa samaaj-sudhaarak ke rup main hi janaa jaataa he
 Very few people are aware of his remarkable role in the efforts made for national independence
 vastusthiti yah he ki paradheen aryaavart main yah kehane kaa saahas sambhavat: sarvapratham swami dayanand saraswati ne hi kiya tha ki "aryaavart, aryavartiyon kaa he"
 The entire plan of our First Independence Summer, 1857 revolution was also prepared under Swamiji's leadership and he was also its principal architect
 ve apane pravachanon main shrotaaon ko praaia: rashtrawaad kaa upadesh dete or desh ke liye mar mitane kii bhaavana bharte the
 In 1855, when the Kumbh Mela was held in Haridwar, Swamiji traveled from Abu Mountains to Haridwar to join it
 raste main unhone sthaan-sthaan par pravachan kiye tathaa deshavaasiyon kii nabj tatoli
 He realized that people are now fed up with the tyrannical rule of the British and are eager to fight for the independence of the country
 swami dayanand saraswati ne haridwar pahunch kar vahaan ek pahari ke ekaant sthaan par apana deraa jamaaya
 While there, he met five such people who later became the masters of the revolution of 1857
 ye paanch vyakti the naanaa sahib, ajimullah khan, bala sahab, tathya tope tathaa babu kunwar singh
 The negotiations went on for a long time and it was here that it was decided to prepare the ground for armed revolution against the Firangi government and then on a certain day, the trumpet of revolution would be played together in the whole country
 jansadharan tathaa aryavartiya sainikon main is kranti kii aawaaj ko pahunchane ke liye 'roti tathaa camel' kii bhi yojana yaheen taiyaar kii gai
 The main role in this entire discussion was that of Swami Dayanand Saraswati

 After his departure, Swamiji established contact with some of his trusted ascetics and formed a secret organization
 is sanghathan kaa mukhyalay indraprastha main mahrauli sthit yogamaya mandir main banaaya gaya
 This headquarters played a notable role in the freedom struggle
 swami ji ke netritv main saadhuon ne bhi sampoorn desh main kranti kaa alakh jagaaya
 He used to carry the messages of revolutionaries from one place to another, encouraging them and if necessary, he himself would take up arms and fight with the British
 san 1857 kii kranti kii sampoorn avadhi main rashtriya netaa, swami dayanand saraswati ke nirantar sampark main rahe
 Even Swami was not disappointed at the failure of freedom struggle
 unhen to is baat kaa pehle se hi abhas tha ki keval ek baar praytn karne se hi swatantrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 For this, a long process of struggle will have to be carried out
 haridwar main hi 1855 kii baithak main babu kunwar singh ne jab apane is sangharsh main safalataa kii sambhaavna ke bare main swami ji se poocha to unka bebaak uttar tha "swatantrata sangharsh kabhi asafal nahin hota
 India has gradually become a revolution in a hundred years
 ab isko swatantra hone main bhi ek sau varsh lag jaaenge
 Many precious lives will be sacrificed in the attainment of this freedom
 " swami ji kii yah bhavishyavaanee kitni sahi nikali, ise baad kii ghatnaon ne pramanit kar diya
 After the failure of freedom struggle, when Tatya Tope, Nana Saheb and other national leaders met Swamiji, he also advised them not to get discouraged and wait for the right time
 1857 kii kranti ke do varsh baad swami ji ne swami virajanand ko apana guru banaaya or unase diksha lee
 Staying in Swami Virjanand's ashram, he studied the Vedas, meditated on them and after that, according to the instructions of his Guru, he started propagating Vedic knowledge
 isi uddeshy kii prapti ke liye unhone arya samaaj kii bhi sthapana kii or uske madhyam se samaaj-sudhaar ke anek kaary kiye
 He campaigned strongly against untouchability, sati, child marriage, male sacrifice, religious parochialism and superstitions and he supported widow marriage, religious generosity and mutual brotherhood
 in sabake saath swami ji logon main deshbhakti kii bhaavana bharne se bhi kabhi nahin chookte the
 In the beginning, many people put various obstacles in Swami ji's social reform work and opposed them
 dhire-dhire unke tark logon kii samaj main aane lage or virodh kam hua
 His popularity continued to grow
 isse angrej adhikariyon ke man main yah ichha uthi ki agar inhen angreji sarkaar ke paksh main kar liya jaae to sahaj hi unke madhyam se jansadharan main angrejon ko lokapriy banaaya ja saktaa he
 Earlier, British officials had likewise joined some other sermons and religious officials by giving different types of temptation
 unhone swami dayanand saraswati ko bhi unheen ke samaan samajha
 Accordingly, Swamiji was met through the then Governor General Lord Northbrook through a Christian priest
 yah mulaakaat march 1873 main kalakatta main hui
 After some formal talk here and there, Lord Northbrook humbly put his point before Swamiji - "in the beginning of your lecture, you will be able to pray for the welfare of the English government in the God you pray
 " Swami ji readily understood everything by listening to the Governor General
 unhen angreji sarkaar kii buddhi par taras bhi aayaa, jo unhen thik tarah nahin samaj saki
 He boldly and firmly replied to the Governor General- governor general ko swami ji se is prakaar ke tikhe uttar kii aashaa nahin thi
 The meeting was terminated immediately and Swamiji returned from there
 iske uparant sarkaar ke guptchar vibhaag kii swami ji par tathaa unki sanstha arya-samaaj par gahari drushti rahi
 Records of each of his movements and every word he spoke began to be kept
 aam janata par unke prabhaav se sarkaar ko ahsaas hone laga ki yah baagi fakir or aryasamaj kisi bhi din sarkaar ke liye khatra ban sakate hai
 Therefore, various types of conspiracies were started to eliminate Swamiji
 swami ji kii mrityu jin paristhitiyon main hui, usase bhi yahi abhas miltaa he ki usamen nishchit hi agreji sarkaar kaa koi shadyantr tha
 Swami ji died on October 30, 1883, at dusk on the day of Deepawali
 un dinon ve jodhpur naresh maharaj jaswant singh ke nimantran par jodhpur gayi hue the
 His frequent discourses were there
 yadakada maharaj jaswant singh bhi unke charnon main baithkar vahaan unke pravachan sunate
 Two or four times Swamiji also went to the state palaces
 vahaan par unhone nanheen naamak veshya kaa anaavashyak hastkshep or maharaj jaswant singh par uskaa atyadhik prabhaav dekha
 Swamiji felt it very bad
 unhone maharaj ko is bare main samajhaayaa to unhone vinamrata se unki baat sweekaar kar lee or nanheen se sambandh tod liye
 This led to a lot of opposition against the little Swamiji
 usne swami ji ke rasoie kaliya urf jagannatha ko apni taraf mila kar unke doodh main pisa hua kaanch dalava diya
 Shortly afterwards Swami came to confess his crime and apologized for it
 udaar-hriday swami ji ne use raah-kharch or jivan-yaapan ke liye paanch sau rupye dekar vahaan se vidaa kar diya taaki police use pareshaan na kare
 Later, when Swamiji was admitted to the hospital in Jodhpur, the concerned doctor also remained under suspicion
 us par aarope tha ki vah aushadhi ke naam par swami ji ko halkaa vish pilaataa rahaa
 Later, when Swamiji's health started deteriorating, he was brought to the hospital in Ajmer
 magar tab tak kaaphi vilamb ho chukaa tha
 Swamiji could not be saved
 is sampoorn ghatnakram main ashanka yahi he ki veshya ko ubhaarne tathaa chikitsak ko bargalane kaa kaary angreji sarkaar ke ishaare par kisi angrej adhikari ne hi kiya
 Otherwise it was not possible for an ordinary prostitute to do such a conspiracy against a well-known and popular person like Swami Dayanand Saraswati only on his own
 bina kisi protsaahan or sangrakshan ke chikitsak bhi aisa dussahas nahin kar saktaa tha
 The body of Swami Dayanand ji, the pioneer of Swadharma, Swabhasa, Swarashtra, self-culture and indigenous promotion, merged into Panchatatva on the day of Diwali in 1883 and he left behind a principle, Krishnamanto Vishwamaryam - that is, make the whole world the best human

 yaheen se unamem garibon ke prati dayaa bhav utpann hua or yahi se uski kai shreshth kahaniyon kaa janm hua, jinamein se 'hryday parivartan' naamak kahani ke aadhaar par khelaa gaya 'urf jimmy balantin' naamak naatak, us samay kaa sarvshereshth naatak siddh hua
 His surname has been discovered by a captain of the prison's soldiers named Henry
 porter ne sochaa ki hastakshar karne ke liye 'o0 henry' hi kaafii he
 When he started writing, he also requested the editors to keep his name a secret
 neuyark main o0 henry, medisson chowk or irving plas ke muhallon ke kamaron main rahete or apni kahaniyon se paisa kama-kama kar kiraaya chukaane ke liye bheeshan sangharsh karte rahete
 Friends, Robert H
 Davis, Bartlett Maris, Irwin S
 Kaab, and many other writers and editors have described their rooms
 ve ek baahar vaale kamare main rahata the
 Whose windows were spread to the floor
 yahaan baithkar vah rahgeeron kii ore ghoorte rahete or unke ird-gird jeevat ke jaal bunate rahete
 He began to make optimistic, monogamous individuals eligible for their stories
 un ladakiyon kii kalpana kii, jo dhandha or pyaar paane ke liye, shaharon main bhatakane aati hai; ve yuvak, jo dusron se adhik laabh khojate hai or ve sharaabi tathaa ayogy aadmi, jo durbhaagya ko bhi ahankaar se jhelte hai tathaa kabhi-kabhi kahaniyon ke paatro kii tarah bhavukta pradarshit karte hai, uske kathanayake bane
 If the plot was unhappy, O
 Henry would have added salt and pepper to the local dialects
 uske liye koi ghatana itani neeras nahin thi ki jisamen vah chamak na paidaa kar sake
 Arriving at the same place, he invented that extreme point or turn, which led to the end of many of his stories becoming unpredictable
 "sajaa hua cameraa,""chat par kaa cameraa" or "vaasanthi menu" jaisi choti kahaniyon main to yah spasht he hi, kuch badi kahaniyon main bhi is tatv ke darshan hote hai
 In the American audience, since the era of sitting around the fire of old times and listening to stories, there has been a special affection for this type of anecdote
 o0 henry kii kahaniyaan inhen paramparaagat kathaon kii vistrat pratikratiyaan maaloom detii he
 He was a magician in the plot and he was a master at creating such hypothetical situations, where his characters seem to be playing with him rather than living
 pathako kaa manoranjan karnaa uskaa dhyey tha or unki kautuhalavratti ko jagaate rakhane ke liye, unhone apanepatro se tarah-tarah ke tamaashe karawaaye hai
 They are depicted as hungry for romance, boldly combating bad times, pretending nobility and wandering in the colorful world of modern 'alif-laila'
 manushya kaa sarvasparshi or sagopang vishleshan unhone shaayad hi kahin kiya ho
 He saw the human being, stranded in the vortex of modern urban life, as a helpless person
 'sneh deep' kahani kii nansi ko sirf ek dukaan main kaam karne ke kaaran, ek dukandaar ladki maanane se vah inkaar kar detaa he or kahata he," ansi koi kism nahin hoti
 Today's corrupt society has become used to finding variety
 " usne manushya ko itnaa gira hua shaayad hichitrit kiya ho ki vah apni kamajoriyon ke liye sharminda bhi na ho
 Beneath all his stories is an undercurrent of kindness and sympathy

 Sometimes they entertain him, sometimes make him sad with the irony of his life and sometimes he gets emotional, but in any case, he accepts every manipulation of fate and his villains are also ridiculous
 - Not evil
 o0 henry kii kala, uski duusari kitaab 'da for million' main nikhar uthi, jisase use kaafii lokapriyata bhi mili
 Forty years after it was first published, the story of his 'gift' was made into a movie
 uski anya kahaniyon ke kai sankalan prakashit hue jaise 'sneh deep', 'pashchim kii aatma', 'shahar kii aawaaj' ,'bhagyachakr' ,'vikalp' ,'dhandhe kii baat' ,' jivan chakra' 
 After his death, three books were published - 'white-collar thugs', 'awara' and 'bhule-bhate'
 o0henry kii kahaniyaan uske jeevankaal main atyann prasiddh raheen or yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki apni rachanaaon or apni vichaardhaara, donon main manushyaswabhaav kii numaaish vratti ke prati asantosh pradarshit karte hue usne hryday kii gaharaaiyon main utarane kii koshish kii
 He wanted to hide the true form of man, rip off every veil of stereotypes and beliefs and make him see the truth
 vah kaha karte the ki satya kii sachhee anubhuti keval kathasahitya main hi ho sakati he
 By arriving at this conclusion from his personal experience, O
 Henry re-established the scholarly belief that imagination is a more powerful invention of beauty than historical fact
 peshewar kahanikaron dwaara bhi kahani-kala main parivartan kiya ja rahaa tha
 The basic, mental, and physical deficiencies of every human being affecting the behavior of man were being discovered and the social effects on the person's life were being evaluated
 yadi jivit rahata to o- henry kahaan pahunchate- yah kahana kathin he, par uskaa yogadan kaafii hota
 Today the stories of O
 Henry are read as a symbol of his era
 jis prakaar brett heart kii kathaayen, pashchimi simapradesh ke khan ke mazdooron, juaariyon or thekedaaron ko punerjeevit kar detii hai, usee prakaar o0 henry kii kahaniyaan san 1900 ke aas-paas kii duniya khadi kar detii he
 When he made fun of the cavalry, the cavalrymen of the Battle of Spain were remembered
 amerikanon ko madhya america ke chote-chote rajya, utane hi vicitra lagate hai, jitna ki uski kahani main varnit achchuriya! swabhaav se vah sankochi or mitbhaashi tha
 He loved Sohbat and a little wine from some of his close friends - who were mainly editors of newspapers
 use hameshaa samay kii kami rahati thi, kyonki uski kahaniyaan atyant choti hoti thi or unke badalen main use jo kuch miltaa, turant samaapt ho jaataa tha
 He continued to grind under the constant demands of the editors
 uske liye jivan ek ast-vyast vyapaar tha, jisamen puraskaar milane kaa dhang bada sanakee he
 Nevertheless, he welcomed this behavior with every gesture
 uski kahaniyon membhagya or sanyog, mahatvapurn part adaa karte he
 There is also ample amount of grief and pain, but bitterness has not penetrated anywhere
 47 varsh kii choti-si aayu main niyati ne jab uski igalila samaapt kar di, tab tak uski sarvshereshth rachanaaen to shaayad likhi nahin gayin thi, parantu usne jo kuch bhi likhaa, uski kathasahitya par amit chhap rahegi or uski kuch kahaniyaan to amar rahegi
 Endoscope means looking inside, and especially it means looking inside the body with the help of endoscope for medical reasons
 endoscope ek aisa upkaran he, jiskaa prayog sharir ke khokhale ang athwa chhidron ke andar jaanch karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Unlike other medical imaging devices, the endoscope is inserted directly into the body part
 endoscopy, aisi takneekee paristhitiyon, jinamein pratyaksh drushti-rekha avlokan vyaavhaarik na ho, main borescope ke prayog ko bhi ullekith kar sakati he
 An endoscope may consist of the following components: endoscopy ke antargat shaamil ho sakate hai: The first endoscope was invented in 1806 by Philippe Bozzini with the development of the "lichtliter" introduced by him to examine the tubes and troughs of the human body
 haalanki vienna medical socity ne aisi jigyaasa ko asweekrut kar diya
 The first endoscope was developed in 1822 by William Beaumont, a military surgeon from mckinney Island, Michigan

 unka iraadaa aisa upkaran viksit karne kaa tha, jisaki madad se chikitsak maanav sharir ke andar dekh sakane main safal ho sake
 The technology available at the end of World War II was still very simple
 maanav sharir ke andaruni bhaag ke pareekshan ke antargat aane vaala kshetra miniechar electric lamp dwaara prakashit kiya jaataa tha
 Efforts were made to reflect light into the body from an external source through an endoscopic tube
 karl stores ne ek yojana ko apanaaya: unhone sharir ke andar upkaran ke jariye bahut hi chamakili, lekin thandi, roshni daalane kaa prayaas kiya, jisase sharir ke andar behtareen drishyata praapt ho or saath hi chitra prasaaran ke jariye vastunishth dastavejikaran sambhav ho sake
 Karl Storge played an important role towards the development of endoscopy, with over 400 patients and functional samples as guides for the coming time

 In the early 1950s Harold Hopkins produced a "fibroscope", which proved useful in both the medical and industry sectors
 in fibron par hone vaale baad ke shodh or vikaas se chitra kii gunvattta main or bhi sudhaar aae
 In the days to come, the use of additional fibers to bring light from a powerful external source to the ends of the object was included in the new development - allowing for a higher level of full spectral brightness, which was needed to see the nuances of the image and color photography
 Is meant for
 optical kshetra main hone vaale vikaas ke saath hi yah kshamta viksit hui, jisamen endoscopist ke haathon main sthit niyantran dwaara tip ko “sanchalit” karnaa sambhav hua or saath hi endoscope ke andar lage shalya-chikitsa upkaran ko remote ke jariye sanchalit karne kii disha main bhi nai suvidhaayen hasil huin
 This was the beginning of the surgery that we know today as key hole surgery
 portugal ke fernando alwes martins ne pratham fibre optics endoscope kaa avishkaar kiya 
 However, the picture quality of the fibroscope had physical limitations
 aadhunik shabdaawalee main 50,000 fibre kaa ek bandal prabhaavshaalee rup main keval 50,000 picksal kaa chitra hi detaa he, iske alaava istemaal main lagaataar parivartan ke kaaran fibre tuutate hai or is prakaar dhire-dhire picksal kam ho jate hai
 Eventually enough damage occurs that the entire bundle needs to be replaced
 hopkins ne mahasoos kiya ki kisi agle optical sudhaar ke liye ek alag vidhi kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Earlier strict endoscopes had very low light transmittance and poor image quality
 sargical kaaryon ke liye shalya-chikitsa ke aujaaron or ilumination system ko endoscope tub se hokar gujaarne kii aavashyaktaa ke kaaran imaging optics ke liye koi khaas gunjaaish nahin thi
 The smaller lens of the traditional system required an auxiliary ring, which acquired a larger portion of the lens; These were quite difficult to construct and put together, as well as optically failing
 hopkins ne jo parishkrut nidaan prastut kiya, vah tha ‘little lens’ ke bich ke sthaan ko glass rod se bhar dena
 These fit precisely into the endoscope tube, making them self-concentrating and requiring no support to fully distribute the 'little lens'
 rod-lens ko sanchalit or istemaal karnaa kaaphi aasaan tha or isane adhiktam uplabdh vyas kaa upyog kiya
 The quality of the image was converted into a 1 mm diameter tube with the correct curvature, coating at the ends of the rod and maximum choices of glass type, as assessed and mentioned by Hopkins
 aise chote vyas vaale ucch gunvattta yukt ‘telescope’ ke saath tul tathaa iluminesh system ko aasaani se ek bahari tub ke bheetar rakhaa ja sakaa
 Karl Storge once again created these new endoscopes first in the form of a long creative collaboration between two individuals
 yadhyapi sharir ke kuch kshetra aise hai, jinhen hameshaa ke liye flexible endoscope kii hi aavashyaktaa hogi, sakht rod-lens endoscopon ke aise apavaadatmak pradarshan rahe hai ki aaj ke samay main bhi ye ek pasandida upkaran hai or vastav main aadhunik kii-hole surgery kii safalataa main sakasham kaarak rahe hai

 ISO Code: cdj ek iglu yaa igluit ) yaa snohouse, barf se nirmit ek aashray he, jise multah inuit dwaara banaaya jaataa he
 The term igloo is used in Inuit for a house or house made of any material, and is not limited to snow houses only, but includes traditional tents, sawdust houses, wooded houses and modern buildings
 
 haalanki, inuit samaaj ke baahar, "iglu" vishesh rup se jame hue him ke khandon dwaara nirmit aashray sthal ko sanderbhit karata he, jo aam taur par ek gumbad ke aakar kaa hota he
 Although igloo is generally associated with all Inuit, it was produced primarily by people from the central Arctic of Canada and the Thule region of Greenland
 anya inuit log, wel kii haddiyon or khaalon se bane apane gharon ko surakshit rakhane ke uddeshy se barf kaa istemaal karte the
 Ice is used because the air bags buried in them make it an insulator
 baahar kaa taapmaana -45 degree c tak kam ho saktaa he, lekin keval akele shaareerik garmi se garm kiye jane par, andar kaa taapmaana -7 degree c se 16 degree c ke bich ho saktaa he
 Igloos are of three traditional types, all of different sizes and used for different purposes
 ek iglu banane ke liye jis barf kaa upyog kiya jaataa he usamen paryaapt sanrachanaatmak majbootee honi chahie taaki use uchit tareeke se kaata or ek par ek rakhaa ja sake
 Snow is suitable for use for this purpose, which is blown by the wind and which condenses and combines the ice pieces
 barf main chute hue chhed, jahaan se khandon ko kaata jaataa he use aamtaur par aashray ke nichle aadhe hisse ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Occasionally, a small tunnel is constructed at the entrance to minimize wind and heat losses when the door is closed
 barf ke utkrisht rodhan gun ke kaaran, based hue iglu andar se ascharyajanak rup se aaramdaayak or garm hote hai
 In some cases, a block of ice is poured so that light can enter the igloo
 vaastu ke aadhaar par iglu is myne main vishisht hota he ki yah ek gumbad he jise swatantra khandon se nirmit kiya jaataa he jo ek-duusare par jhuke hote hai or nirmaan ke dauraan unhen kisi atirikt sanrachana ke bagaiyr feet hone ke liye polish kiya jaataa he
 If properly constructed an igloo can support a weight equal to that of a person standing on a roof
 iske alaava, ek parmparik inuit iglu main, kudlik se utpann garmi ke kaaran uskaa bhitari hissaa halkaa sa pighalane lagata he
 This melts and re-freezes, forming an ice sheet and contributing to the strengthening of the igloo
 shayan manch ek uthaa hua kshetra he
 Because the hot air rises and the cold air settles, the entrance gate acts like a cold trap, while the sleeping area holds all the heat generated by the stove, lamp, or body
 kendriya inuit, vishesh rup se ve jo davis street ke aas paas rahete hai, awasaiya kshetra ko chamadi ke ek parat dwaara dhak dete hai, jo taapmaana ko andar se lagbhag 2 °se

 The 1922 documentary Nanook of the North features the oldest film scenes of an Inuit making an igloo
 film main nanuk, jiskaa asli naam tha alakarialak, ek bade parivaar ke liye iglu or saath hi slage vaale pillon ke liye ek chota iglu banaata he
 Nanook demonstrates the use of cutting and sorting ice blocks with an ivory knife, as well as the use of clear ice in window making
 uskaa iglu lagbhag ek ghante main taiyaar hua or paanch logon ke liye paryaapt tha
 For the purpose of film production, the igloo was cut crosswise so that the scenes inside it could be photographed

 In Sankhya philosophy, three qualities of nature are mentioned - Satta, Rajas and Tamas
 tamas gun ke pradhan hone par vyakti ko satya-asaty kaa kuch pataa nahin chalata, yani wo agyaan ke andhkaar main rahata he
 That is, what is good for him or what is bad, this reality is not known and a person of this nature does not even have the curiosity to know it
 satva, rajas or tamas ke bich vargeekaran ko hindu dharm, buddha dharm or sikh dharm ke vibhinn pahaluon main dekha jaataa he, jahaan tamas sabase nimna hota he
 Tamas is a force that promotes darkness, death, destruction and ignorance, lethargy and resistance
 tamas -prabhavit jivan kaa parinaam karm ke anusaar avagun hota he; ek nimna jivan-rup main padavnati he
 a vindictive life is characterized by laziness, carelessness, malice, fraud, insensitivity, criticism and fault finding, frustration, aimless living, lack of logical thinking or planning and making excuses
 tamsik gatividhiyon main zyada khaanaa adhik sona or / yaa drugs or madiraa kaa seven shaamil he
 This is the most negative quality due to the rejection of karma dharma and the central principle of religious religion: no one should do karma and should not be ignored by it
 shastreey bhartiya darshan ke chah skulon main ek sankhya he jisamen in gunon ko paribhaashit kiya gaya he or vistrut vivaran diya gaya he
 Each of the three qualities has its own distinct characteristics and it is believed that everything is made up of these three
 tamas sabase nimna, baari, dhimi or sust sabase hota he 
 yah rajas kii urja or satva kii chamak se rahit hota he
 Tamas can never be opposed by Tamas
 iskaa pratirodh rajas ke madhyam se kiya ja saktaa he or tamas se sidhe satva main parivartit karnaa or bhi mushkil ho saktaa he

 Briggs has divided the tales based on these legends and the four broad divisions as follows- parantu upar ke pramaanon ke aadhaar par nathmarg ke aadi pravartakon kaa samay naveen shatabdi kaa madhya bhaag hi uchit jaan padataa he
 In this passage, the earlier siddhas have also been inserted later and hence there are dozens of such legends regarding Gorakhnath, which, assuming historical facts, cause date-related problems

 is prakaar ganne kii ausat upaj lagbhag 57 ton prati hactor he jo utpaadan-kshamta se kaaphi kam he
 If the farmer brothers know when and how much fertilizer should be given to the sugarcane and when and how to irrigate it, they can increase the yield of sugarcane to a great extent
 hamaare desh main ganne ke liye prayukt kshetra ko dekhte hue uski upaj apekshaakrit kam he
 The main reason for this is the need to use compost and water at the appropriate time and not to use them properly

 If viewed from the point of view of irrigation facilities for various crops, sugarcane is only 0
