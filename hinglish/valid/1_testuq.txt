 Financea Langdon, and the Cardinals face Camerlengo in a squatting play, where the truth is finally revealed
 Shortly before the novel's start, Pope's at CERN In connection with the discovery it was determined to meet with Leonardo Vetra
 a devout Catholic Vetra believes that science is a relationship between man and God Was able to establish this belief
 This belief was revealed by antimatter research
 Vetra's beliefs greatly troubled Kamerlengo, who strongly believes that the Church alone should not dictate the Christian believer's moral faith, while Vetra discusses The Pope reveals that he supports science, Because he got a son due to science
 Without waiting to hear the details and he is afraid that the pope has broken his pledge of purity, Kamerlengo plans to rectify the situation
 He poisoned the pope and under the guise of the Illuminati, Enlisted a murderer, with the same zeal and opposition to the church that he admitted as a murderer in the fire
 During his ancestors, Vetra was killed So, stealing the antimatter and kidnapping the assassin, the Catholic conference was held
 That's exactly why Camerlengo put the antimatter in St
 Peter and betrayed the final vision, so that he would be the hero of his daring act
 To be seen as the savior of Christendom and the Illuminati, thus the novel had no real role in the events and its "involvement"

 An example of this is the antimatter discussion, in which the book shows that antimatter can be produced in a useful and practical amount and it can be used for electricity
 Will be an infinite source
 CERN has published questions on Angels and Demons often
 It states that an energy of antimatter Cannot be used as a source because it takes so much energy to make, as much as it does not produce
 The same document believes that the novel credited CERN with the invention of the Internet
 In fact, the Internet was created by the United States Department of Defense
 And was created by the team of team berners-lee at the World Wide Web CERN

 He said that i want many young ascetics who can spread to the villages of India and spend their time in the service of countrymen

 Vivekananda was strongly opposed to priesthood, religious fanaticism, dogma and orthodoxy
 unhone dharm ko manushya kii seva ke kendra main rakhkar hi aadhyatmik chintan kiya tha

 hamaare paas usase zyada bahut kuch he jo ham pashchim ko de sakate hai or pashchim ko uski besakhta jarurat he
 This was not a boast or boast of Swami Vivekananda for the heritage of his country

 The main differences distinguishing these subspecies are position, mane appearance, size, and distribution

 Today only eight subspecies are commonly accepted, but one of these is very close to the lions
 vartmaan main aath haal hi kii up prajatiyon ko pahachaanaa jaataa he: Many additional subspecies of lion were found in prehistoric times
 singhon ko baagh ke saath prajnan ke liye janaa jaataa he jisase sankar kaa nirmaan hota he jo liger yaa tigon kehalaate hai
 They have also made leopon by breeding with leopards, and jegallions by breeding with jaguars
 maroji ek spoted singh yaa ek prakritik leopon he, jabaki congolij spoted singh ek jatil singh-jaguaar-tendue kaa sankar he jo lijagulep kehalaata he
 Such hybrids were commonly bred in zoos at some point, but now this process has been discouraged due to the emphasis on conservation of species and subspecies
 china main abhi bhi chidyagharon or nijee pashu pakshi sangrah main sankar prajnan karwaae jate hai
 Liger is a hybrid between a male lion and a female tiger, because a growth inhibitor gene is absent from a female tiger, a growth inducing gene is transferred by a male lion, the resulting liger more than any parent
 Live long

 The colors of lions also vary greatly, ranging from buff to yellow, red, or dark brown
 nichle bhaag aam taur par halke rang ke hote hai or poonch kaa guchha kaala hota he
 Lion cubs are born with brown spots on their body, a symptom similar to leopard

 For example, the lioness, the hunter, lacks a thick cumbersome mane like a male
 yah lakshan shikaar kaa peechha karte samay nar kii apane aap ko chupaane kii kshamta main avrodh banataa he or daudte samay bahut garmi utpann karata he
 The color of the male's mane varies from Kesari to Black, usually this color gets darker as he ages
 vyask singh ke sharir kaa bhaar aam taur par nar ke liye 150-250 kilogram or maadaa ke liye 120-182 kilogram hota he
 According to the Novell and Jackson report, the male weighs 181 kg and the female weighs 126 kg; a male weighing 272 kg was found near Mount Kenya
 Lions vary greatly in size, this variation depends on their environment and area, as a result there is also a great variation in the weight recorded
 udhaaharan ke liye, saamaanya rup se dakshini africa ke singh kaa bhaar purvi africa ke singh kii tulana main lagbhag 5 pratishat adhik paaya gaya he
 Head and body lengths are 170–250 cm in males and 140–175 cm in females; Shoulder height is approximately 123 cm in males
 And 107 cm in female
 it occurs

 The most distinguishing feature that is found in both males and females is that both have a tail ending in a tuft of hair, this bunch has a rigid "spine" or "spur" that is about 5 millimeters long
 , Which is formed from the last part of the tail bone that fused with each other
 singh ek maatr felid he jisamen ek guchchhedaar poonch pai jaati he-is spine or guchchhe kaa kaary agyaat hai
 Absent at birth, this bunch develops at around 51⁄2 months of age and is easily identifiable at 7 months of age
 ek vayask nar singh kii ayaal, billiyon ke bich adwitiya he, yah is prajati kaa sabase vishisht vibhedi lakshan he
 It makes the lion look big, gives a great look; It helps lions during combat with the main competitor of other lions and species, the spotted hyena of Africa, related to the presence, absence, color and size of mane, genetic structure, sexual maturity, climate, and the formation of testosterone
 ; According to Thumb Rule, the deeper and thicker the mane, the healthier the lion is
 sinhani apane langik saathi ke chayan ke dauraan us nar ko praathamikta detii he jisaki ayaal adhik ghani or gahari hoti he
 Research in Tanzania also suggests that mane-length in male-male relationships gives signals of success in fighting

 In a group consisting of two or three males, there is a possibility that the female wants to actively engage with a male whose mane is more dense
 vaigyanikon ne ek baar kaha ki kuch up prajatiyon kii vishisht sthiti ko aakaariki ke dwaara samajha ja saktaa he, jisamen ayaal kaa aakaar shaamil he
 The morphology is used to identify subspecies such as Barbary lion and Cape lion
 However research suggests that environmental factors such as ambient temperature affect the size and color of the mane
 europea or uttari america ke chidiagharon main thande parivesh taapmaana ke kaaran adhik ghani ayaal dekhi jaati he
 Thus the mane is not appropriately identified as a subspecies
 haalanki asian up prajati ke nar, ausat africa singh kii tulana main virali ayaal ke dwara parilakshith hote hai ayaal rahit nar singh kenya main senegal or saavo purv rashtriya park main paae gaye hai or timbavathi kaa mul safed nar singh bhi ayaal rahit tha
 The mane of castrated lions is minimal
 kabhi kabhi antar prajnit singh kii aabaadi main ek ayaal kii anupasthiti pai jaati he; yah antarprajnan bhi janan kii kshamta main kami kaa kaaran banataa he
 Many lions have a ruff that may be evident in special situations
 kabhi kabhi ise murtiyon, chitron, vishesh rup se pracheen kalakaari main ingit kiya jaataa he or ise galati se ek nar kaa ayaal samajha jaataa he
 It differs from a mane, although it is found below the ear at the jaw line, its hair is short and not quickly noticed, while a mane extends over the male's ears
 , Often covering their outer line completely
 vilupt europea gupha singh kii gupha chitrakaari jaanwaron ko ayaal ke bina darshaati he, yaa keval ayaal kaa ek sanket hi detii he, isse yah pataa chalata he ki ve kam yaa adhik ayaal rahit hi the; haalanki, ek samooh ke liye shikaar karti hui maadaaen chitron kaa mukhya vishay rahi hai-chunki unhen shikaar se sambandhit samooh main darshaya gaya he-isliye ye chitra is baat kaa faisla karne ke liye paryaapt nahin hai ki nar ayaal se yukt the
 Pictures show that extinct species used the same social organization and hunting strategies as contemporary lions
 safed singh ek vishisht up prajati nahin he, lekin ek anuvanshik sthiti, leukism kaa vishisht rup he, jo rang main peelepan kaa kaaran hoti he jisase safed baagh jaisaa rang praapt hota he; yah sthiti milanikaran ke samaan he, jo kaale panthrs kaa kaaran he
 They are not albinos, have normal staining in their eyes and skin, white transvaal lions occasionally appear in the cruiser national park and nearby Timbavati private game reserve in eastern southern Africa, but are usually kept in captivity, Breeders select them by thinking
 unke sharir par ek asaamaanya kriim rang kaa aavaran ek aprabhavi jin ke kaaran hota he
 Allegedly, they were bred in camps in southern Africa to be used to kill trophies during cand hunting
 The existence of the white lion was confirmed only in the late twentieth century
 For hundreds of years ago, the white lion was considered only a part of fictional stories in Southern Africa, it was believed that the white skin of the animal represented goodness among all creatures
 citing ko sabase pehle 1900 ke prarambh main report kiya gaya or yah lagbhag 50 saal tak aniyamit rup se jari rahi, jab 1975 main safed singh shaavak ke vyarth padaarthon ko timbavathi game rigerv main paaya gaya
 The lions spend most of their time resting and being inactive for about 20 hours a day, although lions can be active at any time, usually their activity intensifies after dawn when they gather, Groups form and bowel movements

 On an average, they spend two hours a day walking and 50 minutes eating
 singh shikari mansabhakshi hai jo do prakaar ke saamaajik sanghathan ko abhivyakt karte hai
 There are some residents who live in a group called pride
 is pride main saamanyatya lagbhag paanch yaa chah sambandhit maadaaen, donon lingon ke unke shaavak or ek yaa do nar hote hai jo ek vyask maadaa ke saath sambandh banaata he 
 ek pride se sambandhit naron kaa sahamilan aam taur par do tak hota he, lekin bad kar chaar tak bhi pahunch saktaa he or samay ke saath phir se kam bhi ho saktaa he
 Male cubs leave their mother's pride when they are mature
 duusare sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar ko khanaabadosh kaha jaataa he, jo vyapak rup se ek range main faile hote hai or aniyamit rup se ghoomte hai, ye akele yaa jodon main rah sakate hai, sambandhi naron ke jode adhik dekhe jate hai jo apane apane mul pride se alag ho gaye hote hai
 Note that a lion can change its lifestyle; Can become nomadic residents and vice versa
 nar ko is jivan style se hokar guzarana hi padataa he or kuch kabhi bhi kisi pride main shaamil nahin ho pate
 ek maadaa yadi khanaabadosh ban jaati he to uske liye kisi nae pride main shaamil hona adhik mushkil hota he, kyonki ek pride main maadaaen sambandhi hoti hai or ve kisi asambandhi maadaa ke dwaara unke samooh main shaamil hone ke adhikansh prayaason ko asweekrut kar detii hai
 The area enclosed by a pride is called a pride zone, while a nomadic area is called a range
 ek pride se sambandhit nar, apane kshetra main gasht lagate hue, seemaant sthanon main rahanaa pasand karte hai
 Why socialism among the lionesses — the most obvious of any cat race — developed is a matter of controversy
 shikaar main safalataa ke badhane kaa ek spasht kaaran dikhaai detaa he, lekin yah jaanch par adhik nishchit nahin he: ek saath mil kar shikaar karne se prakriya main safalataa milti he, lekin saath hi yah bhi nishchit he ki shikaar nahin karne vaale sadsy prati sadsy calories antargrahan kii maatra ko kam kar dete hai, haalanki kuch shavakon ko uthaa kar bhoomika nibhaate hai, jo is vistaarit samay avadhi ke liye akele chode ja sakate hai
 Pride members regularly play an equal role in hunting
 shikari kaa swasthya pride ke astitv ko banaaye rakhane ke liye praathmik aavashyaktaa he or ve sait par le jane ke baad sabase pehle iskaa upbhog karte hai
 Other benefits include possible family selection, protection of the younger, maintenance of the area, and personal protection against injury and hunger
 sinhani apane pride ke liye adhikansh shikaar karti he, kyonki yah nar kii tulana main adhik choti, furtili or chust hoti he, isamen baari or vishisht ayaal bhi nahin hoti jo thakaan ke dauraan ati ushmit kar de
 apane shikaar kaa peechha karne or use safaltaapurvak khinch laane ke liye ve samooh main sahyog ke saath kaary karte hai
 However, if the prey is nearby, once the lioness succeeds and eats, the male tends to dominate the dead
 ve sinhani ke bajaay shavakon ke saath bhojan ko adhik baantate hai, lekin kabhi kabhi hi apane dwaara maare gaye bhojan ko baantate hai
 Small prey is eaten at the place of prey, hunters share it among themselves; When the prey is large, it is often dragged into the pride area
 bade shikaar ko adhik baanta jaataa he, haalanki pride ke sadsy aksar zyada se zyada bhojan kaa upbhog karne ke liye ek duusare ke prati ugr vyavhaar karte hai
 But males and females protect their pride against intruders
 kuch sadsy nirantar ghuspaithiyon ke khilaaf suraksha karte hai, jabaki anya peeche ho jate hai
 Lions have a special role in Pride
 peeche hat jane vaale sadsy samooh ke liye anya moolyawaan sevaayen pradaan kar sakate hai
 An alternative hypothesis that being a leader is associated with an award, this leader protects from intruders and the lioness's position in the pride is reflected in these responses
 nar yaa pride se sambandhit nar bahari naron se apane pride ke saath sambandh kii raksha karte hai, yahaan bahari nar ve nar hai jo pride ke saath sambandh banane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Females form a permanent social unit in a pride and do not tolerate external females; Membership changes only at birth or at the death of a lioness, although some females leave the pride and become nomadic
 duusari or upvyask nar ko 2-3 varsh kii aayu main paripakvata tak pahunchne par pride ko chhodana padataa he
 Lions are powerful animals that usually hunt in a coordinated group and attack their selected prey
 haalanki ye vishesh rup se apni sahanshakti ke liye nahin jane jate hai- udhaaharan ke liye, ek sinhani kaa hryday uske sharir ke bhaar kaa keval 0
57 pratishat banaata he, jabaki ek hyena kaa hryday iske sharir ke bhaar ke 1 pratishat ke kareeb hota he
 Thus, although lionesses can reach speeds of 60 km / h, they can only do this for short periods, so they must be very close to the prey before launching an attack
 These take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; Most hunting is done at night or in a covered form
 jab ve shikaar se 30 meter yaa usase kam kii duuri par pahunch jate hai
 Then they shout at him
 aamtaur par, kai sinhaniyaan ek saath kaam karti hai or vibhinn binduon se jhund ko gher leti hai
 Once they reach a herd, they usually target the nearest prey
 hamalaa bahut chota or shaktishaalee hota he; ve bahut tej chalaang ke saath jaldi se shikaar ko pakadaney kaa prayaas karte hai
 The victim is usually strangled to death, which may be the cause of cerebral ischemia or asphyxia
 The prey can also be killed by the lion closing its mouth and NASA holes through its claws
 Smaller prey, though, only the lion could be killed by a swipe
 shikaar mukhya rup se bade standhari hote hai, jisamen junglee bist, impala, zebra, bhens or africa main varthog or nil gaay, junglee bor or bharat main kai hiran kii prajatiyon ko praathamikta di jaati he
 Many other species are hunted based on availability
 isamen mukhya rup se 50 se 300 kilogram bhaar ke anagulats shaamil hote hai jaise kudu, haaratabist, jemsbok or alend
 kabhi kabhi, ve apekshaakrit choti prajatiyon jaise thomson kaa gajela or springcoke kaa shikaar karte hai
 Lions living on the banks of the Namib hunt large-scale seal fishes
 samooh main shikaar karte hue singh adhikansh jaanwaron ko ghaseetne main sakasham hote hai, yahaan tak ki swasth vyask ko bhi, lekin unki range ke adhikansh bhaagon main ve bahut bade shikaar, jaise purnataya viksit nar jiraph par kabhi kabhi hi hamalaa karte hai
 Because they are prone to injury
 vibhinn adhyayanon ke dwaara ekatrit vistrut aankade bataate hai ki singh saamanyatya 190-550 kilogram range ke stanadhariyon ko shikaar banaate hai
 Wild Beast comes first in the most preferred hunting category, followed by Zebra
 Most adult hippopotamus, rhinoceroses, elephants and small gazelle, impala and other agile antilope are not commonly included
 haalanki jiraph or bhens ko aksar vishesh kshetron main le jaaya jaataa he
 For example, in Cruiser National Park, giraffes are hunted regularly
 or manyaar pack main, kep bhaisen singh ke bhojan kaa 62% bhaag banaati hai, kyonki bhaison kaa sankhya ghanatv ucch hota he
 Occasionally Hippopotamus is also hunted, but adult rhinoceroses are generally avoided
 haalanki 190 kilogram se chote varthog uplabdhta ke aadhaar par hi shikaar banaaye jate hai
 In some areas, they become specialized for hunting a typical prey species; This case can be seen on the Savuti river, where they hunt elephants
 kshetra ke park gidon ne report di ki bahut bhukhe singh hathi ke bachche ko ghaseet kar le gaye, iske baad kishor hathi ko or kabhi kabhi raat ke dauraan purna viksit vyask hathi ko bhi shikaar banaaya gaya kyonki unki drushti kamjor hoti he
 Lions also attack domestic animals; Cattle are a major part of their diet in India
 ve anya shikariyon ko bhi maarane main bhi sakasham hai, jaise tendua, chita, hyena or junglee kute, yadhyapi pratispardhiyon kii htya ke baad ve unhen kabhi kabhi hi khatm kar daalate hai
 They can also obtain food from animals that have been killed by nature or killed by some other predator, and keep an eye on the vultures constantly moving around, aware that they are killed or Indicates an animal in distress
 ek singh ek baar main 30 kilogram kha saktaa he
 If it is unable to eat the entire dead prey together then it rests for a few hours before consuming more
 ek garm din main, ek pride ek yaa do nar sadasyon ko raksha ke liye chhodkar chaaya main chalaa jaataa he
 An adult lioness requires an average of 5 kg of meat per day and a male 7 kg of meat
 kyonki sinhaniyaan khuli jagah par shikaar karti hai jahaan ve aasaani se apane shikaar ke dwaara dekhi ja sakati hai, sahyog se kiya gaya shikaar ek safalataa kii sambhaavna ko badhata he; yah vishesh rup se badi prajatiyon ke liye sach he
 Working together can protect their prey from other predators such as hyenas, which can also be attracted by vultures in open savannah areas from several kilometers away
 adhikansh shikaar sinhaniyaan hi karti hai; pride se jude nar aam taur par shikaar main bhaag nahin lete hai, keval bade shikaar jaise jiraph or bhais ke shikaar main ve bhaag le sakate hai
 In typical hunting, every lioness has a special position in the group, either catching and then attacking the prey with wings, or moving a short distance to the center of a group and catching prey flying from other lions
 Chhote Singh shows stalking behavior till the age of three months, although he does not participate in hunting until he is 1 year old
 By about two years of age they begin to hunt effectively
 adhikansh sinhaniyaan chaar saal kii umr main prajnan karti hai, singh varsh ke kisi vishesh samay par sambhog nahin karte hai or maadaaen bahundak hoti hai
 Like other cats, male lions have thorns on their penis that are bent backwards
 shishn se waapas baahar aate samay ye kaante maadaa kii yoni kii deevaaron ko ragadate hai, jiske kaaran andotsargan hota he
 a lioness can mate with more than one lion when it is hot; During an intercourse cycle, which lasts for several days, the couple can form a relationship twenty to forty times per day and can even skip food and singles breed very well in captivity
 ausat garbhaavadhi 110 dinon ke aasapaas he, maadaa ek ekant gupha main ek se chaar shavakon ke samooh ko janm detii he, saamanyatya shesh pride se dur jaakar bacchon ko janm detii he
 As long as the cubs are helpless, she herself becomes a victim and remains close to the place where the cubs are kept
 shaavak khud netraheen paidaa hote hai -unki ankhen janm ke lagbhag ek saptaah tak khulti nahin hai, unka vajan janm ke samay 1
2-2
1 kilogram hota he, ve lagbhag asahaay hote hai, janm ke ek do din ke baad rengne lagate hai or lagbhag teen saptaah ke baad chalanaa shuru karte hai sinhani ek maah main kai baar apane shavakon ko gardan se pakad kar ek ek karke nae den main le jaati he, aisa ek hi sthaan par bane rahane se bachane ke liye kiya jaataa he taaki shikari unke shavakon ko nuksaan na pahunchaae
 aam taur par maa apane aap ko ekikrut nahin karti he or uske shaavak chah se aath saptaah kii aayu main pride main laut jate hai
 However, sometimes they come early in the pride, especially when other lionesses have given birth to cubs at the same time
 For example, in a pride, lionesses often synchronize their reproductive cycle to help young children grow and drink milk, which feeds any or all of the females in the pride
 iske alaava, janm ke tulykaalan kaa phayda he ki shavakon kaa aakaar ant main lagbhag ek hi rahata he or is prakaar se unke astitv kii sambhaavnaaen lagbhag baraabar ho jaati hai
 If one lioness gives birth to two months after the second lioness, udhaaharan ke liye, to chote shaavak apane bade bhaaiyon se bahut chote hote hai or bhojan se samay aksar bade shaavak un par haaavee ho jate hai- jiske parinamswaroop chote shavakon main bhukh se mrityu aam hoti he
 Apart from starvation, cub wrists also face other dangers, such as hunting by jackals, hyenas, leopards, martial eagles and snakes
 Even the buffalo drags the cubs to the place where the lioness was protecting them and kills them
 iske alaava, jab ek yaa adhik nae nar puraane nar ko pride se bedakhal kar dete hai, vijeta aksar chote shavakon ko maar daalate hai, shaayad kyonki maadaaen tab tak prajnak or grahi nahin banati hai jab tak unke shaavak paripakv na ho jaaen yaa mar na jaaen
 kul milakar lagbhag 80 pratishat shaavak do saal kii umr se pehle hi mar jate hai
 When the cubs initially come to their pride, they lack the confidence to face any adult lion other than their mother
 lekin, ve jald hi pride ke jivan main ghul mil jate hai, khud hi khelte hai yaa vayaskon ke saath khelnaa shuru kar dete hai
 Lionesses with their cubs are also tolerant of cubs of other lionesses, while lionesses without cubs are not tolerant
 shavakon ke prati nar singh kii sahishnutaa alag alag hoti he- kabhi kabhi, ek nar dhairya ke saath shaavak ko apni poonch yaa ayaal ke saath khilne kii anumati de detaa he, jabaki anya gurraa kar shaavak ko dur bhaga dete hai
 The milk is weaned after six to seven months
 nar singh 3 saal kii umr main paripakv ho jaataa he or 4 saal kii aayu main kisi anya pride se sambandhit nar ko chunauti dekar use pratisthapit karne kii kshamta praapt kar letaa he
 They begin to weaken between the ages of 10 and 15 if they have not been severely damaged while protecting their pride
 yah unke apane vansh ke paidaa hone or paripakv hone ke liye ek choti khidki chhod detaa he
 If they are capable of manufacturing at the time of the Pride, potentially, they may have more cubs that are maturing before being replaced
 ek sinhani aksar bahari nar se apane shavakon kii dridhtaa se raksha karti he, lekin aise prayaas kabhi kabhi hi safal ho pate hai
 Usually he kills all the cubs who are less than two years old
 ek sinhani ek nar kii tulana main kamjor or halki hoti he; safalataa kii sambhaavna tab bad jaati he jab teen chaar maaen ek nar kaa saamana karti hai
 Contrary to popular belief, only males are not evicted from their pride to become nomadic, although most females certainly persist with their birth pride
 haalanki, jab pride bahut bada ho jaataa he, maadaaon kii agali peedhee par dabaav daalaa jaataa he ki ve apana koi kshetra dhund len
 iske alaava, jab ek nayaa nar singh pride par kabja kar letaa he, chote singh, maadaa yaa nar, donon ko nikaala ja saktaa he
 Life is very difficult for a female nomad
 pride ke anya sadasyon kii suraksha ke bina, khanaabadosh sinhani apane shavakon ko paripakvata tak nahin pahunchaa sakati he,
 ek vaigyanik adhyayan kii report ke anusaar nar or maadaa donon sam langikta kaa vyavhaar bhi kar sakate hai
 Male lions can pair for several days and begin homosexual activity, in which affection, love, lads, etc
 are feared
 ek adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki lagbhag 8 pratishat mounting anya naron ke saath prekshit kii gayi he
 Female pairs are common in captivity, but have not been seen in the forest
 haalanki vayask singh ke prakritik parabhakshi nahin he, pramaan bataate hai ki adhikansh maanav ke dwaara yaa anya singhon ke dwaara maare jate hai
 This is especially true for male lions, who, as the chief guard of the pride, become more aggressive when exposed to competing males
 vastav main, ek nar 15 yaa 16 saal kii ek umr tak pahunch saktaa he yadi vah is baat kaa prabandhan kar le ki koi bahari nar use bedakhal na kare
 zyaadaatar nar 10 saal se adhik jinda nahin rahete hai
 This is the reason that the average age of a male lion is less than that of a lioness in the forest
 haalanki, donon hi lingon ke sadsy doosar singhon ke dwaara ghayal kiye ja sakate hai yaa maare ja sakate hai, jab ativyapee kshetron ke do pride sangharsh karte hai
 Various species of tick commonly infect the ears, neck, and neck regions of most lions
 tinia vansh ke feetakrimi kii prajatiyon ke vyask rup aanton main se nikaale gaye hai, singh inhen antilop ke maance ke saath antargrahit kar lete hai
 The lions were attacked by a stationary fly in 1962 at the Ngorongoro Crater; As a result of which the lions were covered with blood, they were eroded
 singhon ne apane aap ko mackhiyon ke kaatane se bachaane ke liye asafalataapurvak pedo par chadhana shuru kar diya or hyena ke bilon main ghusna shuru kar diya; bahut se khatm ho gaye, aabaadi 70 se 15 tak gir gayi
 Recently 6 lions were killed in 2001
 singh vishesh rup se kaid main, canin distemper virus, phelline immuno defishiency virus or phelline sankramak peritonitis se sankramit ho jate hai
 CDV is spread by domestic dogs and other carnivores; In 1994, many lions in Serengeti National Park saw neurological symptoms such as Caesars
 During this outbreak, many lions died of pneumonia and encephalitis
 FIV, jo HIV ke samaan he, haalanki singhon par vipareet prabhaav ke liye nahin janaa gaya he, par gharelu billiyon main kaaphi chintajanak prabhaav paidaa karata he
 Hence systematic testing is recommended in captive lions
 yah kai junglee singh aabaadiyon main ucch se andemic aavruti ke saath hota he, lekin adhikanshtya asia or namib ke singhon main anupasthit hota he
 ' aaraam karte samay, singh kai prakaar ke vyavhaar se samajikaran prardashit karata he or jantu kii bhaavnaatmak gatividhiyaan bahut adhik viksit ho gayin hai
 The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and licking, which have been compared to grooming in primates
 sir ragadnaa, kisi ke maathe ko ragadnaa, chehre or gardan ko duusare singh ke vipareet lagaana-abhivadan kaa swarup he, yah aksar kisi jhagade yaa mukaable ke baad dekha jaataa he yaa ek duusare se alag rahane ke baad milane par dekha jaataa he
 Males rub the other males while cubs and females rub females
 saamaajik chaat aksar sir ragad ke saath agranukram main hota he, yah aamtaur par aapas main hota he or praptakarta khushi vyakt karata he
 The most common parts of the body to be licked are the head and neck, which have arisen from utility, a lion cannot lick these areas individually
 singh chehre ke bhav or sharir kii mudraaen bhi pradarshit karte hai jo drishy sanketon kaa kaam karti hai
 His vocal repertoire is also large; Variations in intensity and pitch of sounds, rather than discrete signals, appear to be the focus of communication
 singh kii awaajon main shaamil hai gurrana, puring, hissing, kaphing yaa khansna, mioing, woofing or garjana yaa dahaadna
 singh kii dahaad ek bahut vishisht tareeke se hoti he, yah kuch gahare lambe garjan se shuru hoti he or chote chote garjan kii shrinkhlaayein iske baad utpann kii jaati hai
 At night they often roar; The sound that can be heard from a distance of 8 km is used to detect the presence of animals
 singh kii dahaad kisi bhi badi billi se tej hoti he
 The intensity and complexity of the relationship between areas where lions and spotted hyenas live together is unique
 singh or spoted hyena donon sheersh ke shikari hai jo samaan shikaar se bhojan praapt karte hai or isliye ek duusare ke pratyaksh pratispardhi hai
 Thus, they often fight each other and steal dead prey by each other
 haalanki hyena ko singh kii shikaar kii kshamtaaon se laabh uthaane vaala, ek avasarwaadi mritjivi mana jaataa he
 Often the opposite is also true
 tanzania ke ngorongoro cretar main, spoted hyena kii jansankhya singh kii tulana main bahut adhik he jo apane bhojan kaa adhikansh hissaa hyena ke shikaar ko chura kar praapt karte hai
 Fights between the two species, however, end in a fight over food
 pashuon main, aam taur par dekha jaataa he ki anya prajatiyon ko kshetreey simaaon ke bheetar sweekaar nahin kiya jaataa he
 Hyenas and lions are exceptions to this; They set boundaries against each other, as if they were members against their own species
 Male lions in particular are very fierce towards hyenas and have been seen to hunt and kill hyenas but do not eat
 iske vipareet, hyena singh ke shavakon ke pramukh shikari hai or sinhani ko sataate hai
 However, healthy adult males, even one, try to avoid them at all costs
 singh kshetra main chote phelline jaise chita or tendua par prabhavi hote hai, jahaan ve sampaitruk hote hai
 They steal dead prey from them and kill their cubs and even do not leave the adults when they get the chance
 chitah ke paas, singh yaa anya shikariyon dwaara, apane mrit shikaar ke churaae jane kii 50 pratishat sambhaavna hoti he
 Lions are the main killers of cheetah cubs, of which up to 90 percent die in the first week of their lives by attacks from other predators
 chitah din ke bhinn samay par shikaar ke dwaara pratispardhaa se bachate hai or apane shavakon ko moti jhaadiyon main chhupate hai
 Leopards also use a similar tactic, but they have a greater ability to survive on small prey than lions or leopards
 saath hi, chitah, tendue pedo par chadh sakate hai or apane shavakon ko singhon se bachane ke liye pedo kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 However, lionesses sometimes succeed in climbing trees to get the prey dead by leopards
 isi prakaar, singh africa junglee kutton par prabhavi hote hai, ve naa keval unka mrit shikaar le lete hai, balki chote or vyask donon prakaar ke kutton kaa shikaar bhi karte hai 
 nil magaramchh ekmaatr sampaitruk shikari he jo singh kaa shikaar kar saktaa he
 Depending on the size of the crocodile and lion, either of them can lose prey or depend on the other
 singh bhoomi par ghoomane vaale magaramchh ko maarane ke liye jane jate hai, jabaki iskaa vipareet bhi satya he jab singh magaramchh se yukt jal nikaay main pravesh kar jate hai, is tathy kaa pramaan tab mila jab ek magaramchh ke pet par singh ke panje ke nishaan paae gaye
 In Africa, lions are found on savanna grasslands with distributed Acacea trees, which give shade; Their habitat in India is a mixture of dry savanna forest and very dry deciduous scrub forest
 apekshaakrit haal hi ke samay main singh keval kendriya varshaavan kshetra or sahaara registan ko chhodkar uresia ke dakshini bhaagon main greece se lekar bharat tak or adhikansh africa main paae gaye

 Currently habitat damage and conflict with humans are the biggest threats to this species
 shesh aabaadiyaan aksar bhugolic rup se ek duusare se alag ho jaati hai, jo antarprajnan kaa kaaran banati hai or iske parinaam swarup anuvanshik bhinnata main kami aati he
 That is why the lion has been considered a sensitive species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, while the Asian subspecies has been considered a serious threat

 The number of mature members in West Africa has been estimated by two recent surveys at 850–1,160, with disagreement over the size of the largest member population in West Africa: 100 to 400 in the early-singou ecosystem of Burkina Faso
 The range of lions has been estimated
 africa or asian donon singhon ke sarankshan ke liye rashtriya parkon or game rigerv kii sthapana or rakh rakhaav kii aavashyaktaa he; sarvottam gyaat main hai namibia kaa etosha rashtriya udyaan, tanzania main serengeti rashtriya udyaan or purvi dakshin africa main kruger rashtriya udyaan
 Outside these areas, the lion's issues with livestock and interactions with the people usually resulted in earlier extinctions

 wildlink International, in collaboration with the University of Oxford, launched its ambitious international Barbary lion project, which aimed to identify and breed Barbary lions in captivity in a national park in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, which would eventually regenerate the lions
 After finding a decrease in lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts have been made, including lion conservation, to prevent this decline
 Lions are one of the species included in the Species Survival Plan, a coordinated effort being made by the Association of Juice and Aquarium to increase its chances of survival

 While lions do not usually hunt people, some prefer to hunt humans; The most well-known cases are Savo Nar Bhakshi, where in 1898, 28 railway employees who were building the Kenya Uganda Railway in nine months became victims of lions while building a bridge over the Savo River in Kenya
 or 1991 main mphuve nar bhakshi, jisane zambia main langwa nadi ghati main chah logon ko maar daalaa

 Infirmity theory, including dental caries, is not favored by all researchers; An analysis of the teeth and jaws of male hermit lions kept in the museum collection suggests that dental caries may explain some of the events, a more likely cause of lion prey on humans, a lack of prey in human dominant areas
 In their analysis of Savo and common male beggars, Karbis Paterhans and Noske considered that sick and injured animals increase their chances of being male eaters

 In April 2004, a male bhakti Singh was killed by sports scouts in southern Tanzania
 It is believed that it killed at least 35 consecutive people in the region of the Rufji delta shore, Dr
 Rolf D
 Baldus, who is the GTZ Wildlife Program Coordinator, remarked that the lion may possibly be a human prey

 He died untimely at the age of 22 in Mathura
 The cause of Shiv Singh's death has been told by the famous writer of 'vansh Bhaskar' that the middle son "sawai Jaisingh had poisoned his son with the help of his queen on the instigation of Ishwar Singh", but like Yadunath Sarkar Historians consider it a 'gapp' and do not accept it

 When the arrival of these Maratha people could not even see any movement of palace invasion or 'rescue', then late in the afternoon, they stepped into the royal residence - 'chandram Mahal', where they reached and informed that Ishwari Singh, Jaipur - Young king of the king, he is no longer in the world

" Apart from Ishwari Singh, funerals of all Jaipur kings were held in the ghatris, but "they were secretly set on fire around the palace complex

 Seven murals made of indigenous colors are related to the themes of the Ramayana and one is from the Mahabharata
