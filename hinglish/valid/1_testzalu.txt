 Produced under the banner of Phantom Films, Reliance Entertainment and Color Yellow Productions, the film is produced by Anand L
 Rai, Vikramaditya Motwane, Madhu Mantena and Anurag Kashyap
 film kii kahani shravan singh ke ird gird gumti he, jo ek nichali jati kaa mukkebaaz he, or mukkebaaji kii duniya main apni pahchaan banane ke liye nirantar sangharshrat he
 The story of the film was written by Vineet Kumar Singh along with Mukti Singh Srinet in 2013
 iske baad vah apni kahani lekar kai nirmaataaon ke paas gaye, parantu un sab ne is par kaam karne se manaa kar diya
 In July 2017, it was announced that Anurag Kashyap would collaborate with Anand L

6 crores, the film earned only 10 crores at the box office, and was declared a flop
 shravan singh ek sachcha tathaa eemaandaar mukkebaaz he, jo kisi din vishwa prasiddh boxr bananaa chahta he
 In attempts to do so, Shravan often encounters Bhagwan Das Mishra, a local don, as well as the head of the state boxing association

 Singh went to several producers with his story, but they all refused to work on it, because Singh had the condition that if the film was made on his story, he himself would play the lead role

 At the same time, after participating in an actual boxing tournament in North India, he also felt that there was no spectator in these competitions, except for some ruling people who decide which boxer should represent which state, and Not whom in kahaniyon kaa prayog phir film ke kathanak ko likhane ke liye bhi kiya gaya tha
 The shooting of the film did not involve the assistance of any boxing choreographer or action director

 In the 'nothing Wrong' story, the dreams of a struggling widower father and younger brother begin to kiss the sky as soon as the eldest son goes to Germany, but as it happens, the eldest son is completely disappointed

 The character of the struggling father, who is also a widower, has emerged very strongly in this story

 What is the necessity of this development or reversal? The hero-heroine of Suraj Paliwal is not able to accept the urbanity of masked double life even after spending a long period of age in the city
 unhen saral, sahaj, akrutrim jivan hi bhaataa he
 This face without color is not so attractive and visually impaired, but not a cheat
 uhapoh ke bich aksar nirnay bhi der tak dahalij par thithka padaa rahata he, par antat vah jhukta he sahaj, saral or akrutrim kii ore
 The quest for spontaneity probably brings the narrator to the 'jungle', where everything is in its natural form — primitive and unnatural love, hate too — to surrender to the endless torture of police by killing a forest employee with an ax The dark black color of the Adivasi tribal and hot eyes hot on the deformed mouth of insults are still following me

 Chauth's entire history revolves around the Chautha Mata Shakti Peetha, this village has a grand temple of Chauth Bhawani which is situated at an altitude of 1100 feet above the Aravali Shakti Giri mountain range, this temple was founded by Maharaja Bhim Singh Chauhan
 In 1451, on the mountain of Barwada
 vartmaan chouth kaa barwada ko pracheen kaal main "barbada" naam se janaa jaataa tha jo ki ranthambhore samrajya kaa hi ek hissaa rahaa he, is kshetra ke pramukh shaskaon main bijalsinh evam bhimsingh chouhan pramukh rahe hai
 Charu and Pachala near Barwada region, which have become villages in the present time, were the main places of stay of tribals in the dense forests in ancient times
 chouth mata kii pratham pratimaaka anumaan churu jangalon ke aasapaas mana jaataa he
 According to a legend, in ancient times, there was the practice of a terrible fire in the Charu forests, which led to the destruction of Darud Bhairo
 is pratimaa ke chamatkaaron ko dekhakar jangal ke adivaasiyon ko pratimaa ke prati lagaav ho gaya or unhone apane kul ke aadhaar par chaur mata ke naam se isaki puja karne lage, baad me chaur mata kaa naam dhire dhire churu mata evam aage chalakar yahi naam apbhransh hokar chouth mata ho gaya
 It is known that this mother was first worshiped by the people of the Chaura ie Kanjar caste as her Kuldevi, later the tribals also considered it as their goddess Aradhya who belonged to the Meena tribe
 yahi kaaran rahaa he ki chouth mata ko adivaasiyon meenaon evam conjaron kii kuladevi ke rup main janaa jane laga
 Years later, the statue of Chauth Mata suddenly vanished from the formidable forests of Charu, the atom of which is very difficult to say correctly, but years later the same statue began to appear in the dream of Maharaja Bhim Singh Chauhan in the foothills of Barwara region, but Bhimsinh Chauhan Has ignored it
 kahan jaataa he ki ek baar maharaja bhimsingh chouhan ko raat main swapn aayaa ki shikaar khilne kii parampara ko main bhuulataa ja rahaa hoon, isi swapn kii vajah se maharaja bhimsingh chouhan ne shikaar khilne jane kaa nishchay kiya, maharaja bhimsingh chouhan barwada se sandhya ke vakt jane kaa nishchay kiya evam shikaar karne kii taiyaari karne lage
 The queen of Bhimsingh Chauhan was named Ratnavali
 kaha jaataa he ki ratnavali ne raja bhimsingh chouhan ko shikaar par nahin jane ke liye bahut manaa kiya, magar bhimsingh ne yah kahkar baat ko taal diya ki "chouhan ek baar savaar hone ke baad shikaar karke hi neeche utarate hai"
 Thus, ignoring the queen's words, Bhimsingh Chauhan along with his soldiers traveled towards the dense forests
 shaam kaa samay tha lekin bhimsingh chouhan jangalon main shikaar kii khoj hetu badhate hi rahe, yakayek maharaja bhimsingh chouhan kii nazar ek mrug par padi or unhone mrug kaa peechha karnaa shuru kar diya, sainik bhi raja ke saath badhane lage, lekin jangalon main raat ho jane ke kaaran sabhi sainik aapas main ek duusare se bhatak gaye
 Maharaja Bhimsingh decided to chase the deer by aiming for the voice as it became night and proceeded towards the deer
 mrug dhire dhire bhimsingh chouhan kii najaron se ojhal ho gaya
 By the time all the king's soldiers had lost their way from the king
 bhimsingh chouhan ne chaaron taraf nazren daudai magar uske paas koi bhi sainik nahin rahaa or pani ke shrout ko khojane lage kyonki unako pyaas bahut sataane lagi thi
 Even after a lot of effort, when water was not available, Bhimsingh Chauhan fainted and fell into the forests
 bhimsingh ko swapn main pachaalaa talahati main vahi pratimaa dikhne lagi
 Then suddenly it started raining fiercely and the thunder started thundering and lightning started to blow, when the rage broke due to the rain of the king, the king sees that there was water all around, the king drank the water first and saw a girl in the dark night The girl was seen playing as a bright bright hair like the sun herself
 Bhim Singh Chauhan was a little frightened to see that girl and said, o Bala, what are you doing alone in this forest? The Where is your parents, the young girl listening to the king started laughing and said in a taut voice, o Rajan, tell me whether your thirst is quenched or not, by saying so much, Bhagwati came in her true form, as soon as the king's mother came Fell at the feet and said, o Adishakti Mahamaya, i do not want anything from you, if you are happy with me, then you can always live in our area! Bhagwati Shivamaya became impassioned by saying that Raja Bhim Singh Chauhan had said that mother will fulfill her wish
 usee chouth mata kii pratimaa ko lekar raja barwada kii ore chal diya, barwada aate janata ko raja ne puraa haal bataaya or samvath 1451 main adishkti chouth bhavani kii barwada main pahaad kii chotii par magh krishna chaturthi ko vidhi vidhaan se sthapit kiya, tab se lekar aaj tak isi din chouth mata kaa mela bharta he jisamen lakhon kii taadaad main bharatvarsh se bhagat jan maan kaa aashirwad lene aate rahete he
 The above saying is still going on for Bhimsingh Chauhan: - Leave Choru and leave the rest, Barwada Dhari Malan, "bhimsingh Chauhan Ku, Ma Di Di Parchaya Atom is prakaar chouth mata ke naam par barwada kshetra aage aage chouth kaa naam jodakar maharaja bhimsingh chouhan ne is kshetra kaa nayaa naam rakh diya chouth kaa barwada
 Chauth Mata Shakti Peetha is considered to be the most famous of the Chauth's Barwada in the temples of Chauth Mata, famous in India for Suhag Puja, so it will not be an exaggeration to call Chauth's Barwada as Shakti Nagar, Chauth Mata's first place
 The second Pachala has been a village, while Samvat from 1451 to the present, this temple is located at Chauth ka Barwara
 chouth mata ko choron va conjaro kii kuladevi mana jaataa he evam adivaasiyon main meena janajati ke nareda gautra kii kuladevi ke rup main chouth mata ji ko vishesh sthaan praapt he aaj bhi meena jati ke nareda gautra main navaratri puja ke samay mata ke pratik ke rup main trishul evam nahar ke putr nareda ke rup main nahar kaa panja banaakar poojane kii pratha pracheen samay se chali aa rahi he
 According to legends, Barwal Gautra of Meena Samaj also considers Chauth Mata as his Kuldevi

 After marriage, Siddhartha left the only firstborn child, Rahul and wife Yashodhara, leaving the royal palace in the night in search of true divine knowledge and searching for a way to liberate the world from death, death and sorrows

 Part of the category of unka janm 563 isvi purv ke bich shakya ganraajya kii tatkaaleen rajdhani kapilwastu ke nikat lumbini main hua tha, jo nepal main he
 The Lumbini Forest was located 8 miles west of Nautanwa station between Kapilvastu and Devdah in the Terai region of Nepal, near a place called Rukminidei

 He was raised by his maternal aunt and Mahaprajavati, the second queen of Shuddodhan
 shishu kaa naam siddharth diya gaya, jiskaa arth he "vah jo siddhi prapti ke liye janma ho"
 During the birth ceremony, the sage Drishta Asit announced from his mountain abode - the child would either become a great king or a great pious guide
 shuddodhan ne paanchaven din ek namakaran samaaroh yojit kiya or aath brahman vidwaanon ko bhavishya padhane ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Everyone made the same dual prediction that the child would become either a great king or a great holy man
 dakshin madhya nepal main sthit lumbini main us sthal par maharaj ashok ne teesri shatabdi isa purv buddha ke janm kii smriti main ek stambh banwaaya tha
 Buddha's birthday is widely celebrated in the Theravada countries
 suddharth kaa man vachapan se hi karunaa or dayaa kaa strot tha
 It is revealed by many events in his early life
 ghuddaud main jab ghode daudte or unke munh se jhaag nikalne lagata to siddharth unhen thakaa jaanakar vahiin roak detaa or jiti hui baaji haar jaataa
 Even in the game, Siddharth liked to lose himself because defeating someone and grieving someone was not seen by him
 siddharth ne chachere bhai devdatt dwaara tir se ghayal kiye gaye hans kii sahaayta kii or uske praanon kii raksha kii
 Siddhartha not only studied the Vedas and Upanishads with Guru Vishwamitra, he also studied politics and warfare
 kushti, ghuddaud, tir-kaman, rath haankane main koi uski barabari nahin kar paata
 At the age of sixteen, Siddharth was married to Koli girl Yashodhara
 pita dwaara rituon ke anuroop banaae gaye vaibhavshaalee or samast bhogon se yukt mahal main ve yashodhara ke saath rahane lage jahaan unke putr rahul kaa janm hua
 But after marriage, his mind went into disinterest and he abandoned the family for the sake of peace and happiness
 raja shuddhodhan ne siddharth ke liye bhoga-vilaas kaa bharpoor prabandh kar diya
 Built three beautiful palaces worth three seasons
 vahaan par naach-gaan or manoranjan kii sari saamagree juta di gai
 Slaves and maids were put in his service
 par ye sab chijen siddharth ko sansar main baandhakar nahin rakh sakin
 One day in the spring, Siddhartha went on a garden walk
 unhen sadak par ek boodha aadmi dikhaai diya
 His teeth were broken, his hair was caught, his body was crooked
 haath main lathi pakade dhire-dhire kaanpata hua vah sadak par chal rahaa tha
 The second time when Kumar went for a garden walk, a patient came in front of his eyes
 uski saans teji se chal rahi thi
 The shoulders were loose
 baahen suukh gai thim
 The stomach was swollen
 cheharaa pilaa pad gaya tha
 He was able to walk very hard with the help of another
 teesri baar siddharth ko ek arthi mili
 Four men were taking him
 peeche-peeche bahut se log the
 Some were crying, some were beating their chest, some were scratching their hair
 in drishyon ne siddharth ko bahut vichlit kiya
 He thought 'damn it to youth, who soaks up life'
 dhikkaar he swasthya ko, jo sharir ko nasht kar detaa he
 Damn to life, which completes its chapter so soon
 kya budhapa, beemaari or maut sadaa isi tarah hoti rahegi saumy? chauthi baar kumaar bageeche kii saiyr ko niklaa, to use ek sanyasi dikhaai padaa
 Free from all the feelings and desires of the world, a happy monk attracted Siddhartha
 sundar patni yashodhara, dudhmunhe rahul or kapilwastu jaise rajya kaa moh chhodkar siddharth tapasya ke liye chal pade
 He reached the Rajgriha
 vahaan bhiksha maangi
 While walking around, Siddharth reached Alar Kalam and Uddak Ramputra
 unase yoga-sadhana sikhi
 Learned to trance
 par usase use santosh nahin hua
 He reached Uruvela and started doing penance in various ways there
 siddharth ne pehle to keval til-chaaval khaakar tapasya shuru kii, baad main koi bhi aahaar lenaa band kar diya
 The body became very thin
 chah saal biit gaye tapasya karte hue
 Sidharth's penance was not successful
 shanti hetu buddha kaa madhyam maarg : ek din kuch striyaan kisi nagar se lautati hui vahaan se nikaleen, jahaan siddharth tapasya kar rahaa the
 One of his songs hit Siddharth's ear - 'don't let Veena's strings loose
 dhilaa chhod dene se unka surila swar nahin nikalegaa
 But don't tighten the wires so much that they break
 ’ baat siddharth ko janch gai
 He agreed that yoga is proved only by regular dieting
 ati kisi baat kii acchhee nahin
 The medium path is right for any attainment and for this one has to do hard penance
 baisakhi poornima ke din siddharth vatvriksh ke neeche dhyansth the
 Sujata, a woman from a nearby village, had a son
 usne bete ke liye ek vatvriksh kii manauti maani thi
 He appeasement to the whole platter of gold reached cow milk pudding filling
 siddharth vahaan baitha dhyaan kar rahaa tha
 He felt that the tree goddess is sitting as if holding a body to take worship
 sujatha ne bade aadar se siddharth ko kheer bhent kii or kaha- ‘jaise meri manokamana puri hui, usee tarah aapaki bhi ho
 Siddhartha's meditation succeeded on meditating on the same night
 use sachcha bodh hua
 Since then Siddhartha has been called 'buddha'
 jis pipal vriksh ke neeche siddharth ko bodh mila vah bodhivruksh kahalaaya or gaya kaa sameepvarti vah sthaan bodhgaya
 Till the age of 80, he propagated his religion in Pali, the simple simple language of that time instead of Sanskrit
 unke sidhe saral dharm kii lokapriyata teji se badhane lagi
 After remaining under the Bodhi tree for four weeks and contemplating the nature of religion, Buddha went out to teach religion
 asadha kii poornima ko ve kaashi ke paas mrigadaav pahunche
 At the same place, he gave the first sermon and made the first five friends his followers and then sent him to preach
 pali siddhant ke mahaparinirvana sutt ke anusaar 80 varsh kii aayu main buddha ne ghoshnaa kii ki ve jald hi parinirvana ke liye ravaanaa honge
 The Buddha took his last meal, which he had received as an offering from a blacksmith named Kunda, causing him to become seriously ill
 buddha ne apane shishy anand ko nirdesh diya ki vah kunda ko samajhaae ki usne koi galati nahin kii he
 He said that this food is incredible
 bhagwaan buddha ne logon ko madhyam maarg kaa upadesh kiya
 He suggested an octagonal path for grief, its causes and redress
 unhone ahimsa par bahut jor diya he
 He condemned yajna and animal sacrifice
 buddha ke upadeshon kaa saar is prakaar he - The number of monks began to increase with the preaching of the Buddha
 bade-bade raja-maharaja bhi unke shishy banane lage
 Shuddhodhan and Rahul also initiated Buddhism
 bhikshuon kii sankhya bahut badhane par buddha sangh kii sthapana kii gai
 Later, at the urging of the people, Buddha also allowed women to take him into the union, though he did not consider it as good
 bhagwaan buddha ne ‘bahujan hitay’ lokkalyaan ke liye apane dharm kaa desh-videsh main prachaar karne ke liye bhikshuon ko idhar-udhar bheja
 The emperors like Ashoka also played an important role in the promotion of Buddhism abroad
 mauryaal tak aate-aate bharat se nikalakar buddha dharm china, japan, korea, mongolia, burma, thailand, hind china, srilanka aadi main fail chukaa tha
 Buddhism is the majority religion in these countries

 Nevertheless, Kerala's economic system has its own specialties

 Among the basic elements of human resource development are notable - lower population growth rate than other states of India, higher than national average density, higher age-rate, critical health consciousness, lower infant mortality, higher literacy, primary education Publicity, higher education facilities etc
 are favorable for economic progress

 phir bhi yah kahana uchit nahi ki kerala kii aarthik vyavastha maatr krishi adhaarit he
 The notable aspect of Kerala's economic development is neither the agricultural sector considered as a primary sector nor the industry sector with various production-making
 aarthik vikaas kaa mukhya pahalu teesraa kshetra he jise seva - kshetra kaha jaataa he
 Majority of Kerala income and employment is received from here

 Apart from this, the amount of money received from non-resident Kerala from other regions of India and abroad, especially in the Gulf region, is also the reason for this development

 Kerala occupies a prominent place in India's agricultural economy

 The major crops of Kerala are - rice, coconut, various varieties of pulses, rubber, betel nut, cardamom, coffee, tea, cashew, tapyoca, black pepper, ginger, turmeric, cocoa, cloves, nutmeg etc

 Rubber, coffee, cardamom, tea etc
 are considered as farm crops

 The agricultural sector of Kerala is facing many crises, including the acute crisis in the production of both rice and coconut

 Not only this, the expansion of agricultural land has also decreased

 Due to debt load, destruction of crops, fall in prices, life of farmers has become difficult
 atah sarkaar krishi package tathaa rin aashwaasan ayog aadi kaa gathan karke krishi ke punaruddhar kaa prayaas kar rahi he
 The history of Kerala's agriculture begins with the new stone age
 punam krishi jaisi aadim krishi reetiyaan pracheen kaal main prachlit thim
 The tribals had their personal agricultural practices
 pracheen krishi samskruti ke abhinn ang the, krishi ke vibhinn aujaar deshi beej, beej sangrakshan kii paddatiyaan, krishi kaal, bhinn prakaar kii krishi bhumiyaan or krishi se jude reeti-rivaaz, krishi anushthan, krishi - utsav, krishi geet aadi
 Kerala has a large repository of indigenous knowledge related to agriculture
 kerala main vishesh krishi kshetra hai, ye hai - kuttnad, palakkad, kantallur, nelliampati aadi
 Other notable elements in the agriculture sector are small water irrigation schemes, reservoir development schemes, etc
 machhlee paalan or pashu paalan aadi bhi krishi kshetra ke pramukh kaary hai
 In the new stone age man had moved towards agriculture and animal husbandry
 un dinon manushya ke paas do prakaar ke hathiyaar the - pathar se bane farse or ped kii lakdi se bani laathiyaan
 The new stone age must have been agricultural in Kerala as well, because sharp-edged stones have been obtained from some areas of the Sahyadris
 vaynad ke thirunelli tathaa bawalippuzha ke tat par se tathaa pootati naamak sthaan se jo prastar farse praapt hue ve isi prastar yug ke hai
 Animal husbandry and farming by trimming the hillsides of the hills were the lifestyle of the new stone age farmers

 In this era, paddy, fruits, kandamul etc
 would have gained prominence in food

 The Loh era must have started in Kerala too

 The Sanghamic compositions are related to the production process which also gives details of various tribes

 Vellalars are not considered as distinct caste divisions in Kerala
 yahan krishakon ko kisi jati vishesh varg kaa nahin mana gaya he
 Later, the people of the waiter and ire class also started doing agricultural work

 Later, they came to be known as plowlers and pullers
 'pulam' shabd kaa arth bhoomi he
 The agricultural region was called 'mainpulum' and the hilly regions around it where agriculture is not done were called 'vanapulam'
 'menpulam' aadim krishi ke vikaas ko suchit karata tha
 Although Sangham literature provides a detailed description of agriculture, there is no mention of the result of production in them
 yah bhi spasht nahin he ki us kaal kii krishi vishaal aabaadi kaa paalan poshan kar sakati thi ki nahin
 The concept of division of the five 'tinkal' forms of the Sangham period also presents the picture of the ancient farmers - life
 krishi ke itihaas kaa aglaa charan buddha, jain, brahman aadi dharm ke logon ke kerala aagaman ke baad kaa he
 Buddhism inspired agriculture
 jab brahman nadi tat par bas gayi to unhone krishi par adhikaar jamaa liya
 The bulk of the farms came to the villages of Brahmins
 brahmanon kaa khetibari par aadhipaty jamane kaa kaaran unka jyotish gyaan tha jiske aadhaar par unhone krishi kii yojana taiyaar kii or uskaa niyantran bhi apane paas rakhaa
 They established their hold on the land by establishing temples
 is tarah unhone sidhe krishi na karte hue bhi krishi utpaadan par niyantran praapt kar liya
 This also brought about a change in the production system
 ushvar naamak jan, saamaanya vibhaag ke log, anek upavibhaagon main bant gayi
 Karlar, Kutikal, Attiyar became the head sub divisions
 pramukh krishak karalar kahalaane lage
 Due to the name of the temples of agricultural land, the Karlar became subject to the Brahmins

 It is likely that the word Greek alphabetical order, the third letter of the Greek alphabet, alternatively, the word "gematria" is generally held to be derived from the Greek geōmetriā, being derived from gamma "geometry," which translates to gēmaṭriyā
 Although used as it is, some scholars believe it to derive from Greek grammateia, rather, it is possible that both words had an influence on the formation of the Hebrew word
 yah angreji main prachlit kiya gaya he
 From the 17th century by the translation of works by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola
 Although apparently derived from the Greek language, it is largely used in Jewish texts, especially among those associated with Kabbalah, for the most well-known example of Gematria is the Hebrew word chai, which refers to two letters which refer to up to 18 Is made up of joints for
 yah 18 yahudiyon ke bich ek "bhaagyashaalee sankhya" bana diya he or yahudiyon ke bich 18 ke gunakon main uphaar bahut aam hai
 Some identify two forms of gematria: the "revealed" form, which is found in many interpretive rabbinic methods, and the "mystical" form, prevalent in a largely Kabbalistic practice
 However gematria is most often the individual words, psukim, Talmudic aphorisms, sentences from standard Jewish prayer, are used to calculate the values of personal, angelic and righteous names and other religiously important material, Kabbalists use them frequently For Ane manner phrases and, sometimes, for various languages
 a few examples of Gematria in Arabic, Spanish and Greek, spelled with Hebrew letters, are mentioned in the works of Rabbi Abraham Abulafia, also some Hasidic Rabbis used it, though rarely, however, for Yiddish The primary language for gematria enumeration has always been and remains Hebrew and, to a lesser degree, Aramaic

 Fiqh is called Islamic theology
 fiqh musalamaanon ke liye islamic jivan ke har pahalu par apana asar rakhata he
 While the Shari'a calls that set of policy
 jo islamic kanoonee, paramparaon or islamic vyaktigat or naitik aacharnon par aadhaarit hoti he
 Fiqh is the terminology for Islamic jurisprudence, which is made up of the judgments of Islamic jurists
 islamic adhyayan kaa buniyadi ghatak, fiqh us paddati ko vistaar se batalaata he jiske jariye se islamic kanoon ko praathmik or madhyamik sroton se baahar nikaala gaya he
 The history of Islamic jurisprudence is "divided into eight periods by custom"
 mahatvata ke kram main fiqh ke strot hai: The Qur'an gives clear instructions on many issues such as how to perform purification rituals before compulsory daily prayers, but on other issues, some Muslims believe that the Qur'an alone is not enough to make things clear
 udhaaharan ke liye, koran ke anusaar— ramadan ke maheene ke dauraan, dainik prarthanaayen or upwas main sanlagn hone kii zarurat he lekin musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki in kartavyon kaa paalan karne ke tareeke ke bare main unhen or hidaayat kii aavashyaktaa he
 Explanations of these issues can be found in the traditions of Prophet Muhammad, so in most cases the arguments are the basis of the Quran and Sunnah
 islam ke praarambhik kaal main kuch vishay bina misaal ke hai un maamalon main, musalmaan nyayavid anya tareekon se nishkarsh par pahunchane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Sunni jurists exercise the historical consensus of the community; In the modern era, most jurists also use analogy and comparison of the profit and loss of new subjects
 in atirikt upkarnon kii sahaayta se nishkarsh aane par sharia ke hisaab se kanoonon kii ek vyapak sarani banati he or ise fiqh kaha jaataa he
 Thus, in the face of the Shari'ah, Fiqh is not considered sacred, and there are disproportionate views on other aspects of the 'schools of thought process' without looking at them as sacred

 transafarmar yaa parinamitra ek vaidyut mashin he jisamen koi chalane yaa ghoomane vaala avyav nahin hota
 The transformer is probably the most widely used electrical instrument in electrical equipment
 yah kisi ek vidyut paripath se anya paripath main vidyut preran dwaara paraspar jude hue chaalkon ke madhyam se vidyut urja sthantarit karata he
 The transformer can only work with alternating current or voltage, not with direct current
 transformar ek-feji, teen-feji yaa bahu-feji ho sakate he
 It is the most efficient machine among all electrical machines

 a transformer may have one, two or more windings
 do vinding vaale transafarmar ke praathmik evam dwitiyak vinding ke pheron kii sankhya evam unke vibhavantaron main nimnlikhit sambandh hota he: It is clear from this formula that by properly selecting the number of rounds of primary and secondary winding for a given value of primary voltage, we can get the desired voltage in the secondary winding
 jab dwitiyak vinding kaa vibhavaantar praathmik vinding ke vibhavaantar se adhik hota he to aise transpharmar ko ucchayi parinamitra kehete hai
 In contrast, when the voltage of the secondary winding is less than the voltage of the primary winding, such a transformer is called a catabolic transformer
 transafarmar kaa mukhya upyog vidyut shakti ko adhik voltata yaa kam voltata main badalanaa he 
 Doing so brings convenience and efficiency in the use of electrical energy
 dhyatavya he ki adarsh transafarmar urja yaa shakti utpann nahin karata, na hi shakti kaa parivartan karata he, na hi aavriti badalata he
 Transformer used in the field of electricity sambhavat: sarvaadhik vyapak rup se upyog main aanevaala Vaidyut is Sacritra

 yah parenaaman urja kii nunatam haani se or saadhitra main bina kisi gatiman bhaag kii sahaayta ke sampann ho jaataa he
 a 100 ampere current is required for the elimination of 10,000 watts of 100 volts
 par 10,000 kii voltata par keval ek ampiore dhara paryaapt hoti he
 Therefore, in the second case, the diameter is much less than the first and due to this, cheaper conductor is required
 parinamitra kaa kaarysanchalan micel farede kii ek adwitiya khoj par aadhaarit he, jiske anusaar paripath main prerit vidyutvahak bal, paripath dwaara paribaddh kshetra ke aarpaar chumbakeey flux ke parivartan kii samay dar ke ke baraabar hota he
 In simplest form, the transformer consists of two separate coils, which have the same magnetic circuit
 shakti ke pravaah kii disha ke anusaar parinamitra ke kundalanon kaa abhinirdhaaran kiya jaataa he
 Connect the primary coil to the source of alternating current and the secondary to the load
 vidyucchumbakeey preran dwaara urja praathmik kundali se dwitiyak kundalan main sthanantarit hoti he
 The characteristics of operation of an ideal transformer are: vyavahaarat: yah adarsh sthiti dushprapya he
 The feed voltage associated with the primary coil of the transformer produces magnetic flux, which is connected to the plated core of the transformer
 parinamitra ke praathmik kundali se judi hui prayavarti voltata Ep ko ucchtam chumbakeey flux ke ghanatv Bm, patlit crode kii anuprastha kaat kaa kshetrafal A, prayavarti dhara kii aavrirti dhara kii aavriti f tathaa praathmik kundali main lapeton ko sankhya N1 ke padon main vyakt kiya jaataa he: The alternating magnetic flux generated by the current flowing in the primary coil also correlates with the wraps of the secondary coil
 praathmik or dwitiyak kundaliyon main antar keval lapeton kii sankhya kaa hota he, at: dwitiyak kundali main prerit voltata kaa prabhavi maan Thus the following ratio of primary and secondary voltage is obtained: praathmik kundali kii voltata ko badhaane ke aavashyaktaa padane par praathmik kundali main lapeton kii sakhya N1 ko dwitiyak kundali kii lapeton kii sankhya N2 se kam rakhaa jaataa he
 This type of transformer is called a high transformer and if the voltage of the primary coil is greater than the voltage of the secondary, then the number of wraps in the primary coil N1 will be larger than the number of wraps of the secondary coil N2
 is prakaar ke parinamitra ko apchaayi parinamitra kehete hai
 Generally the nature of the transformer is determined by the following: saamaanya lod par saadhaaran shakti parinamitra kii dakshata bahut adhik hoti he, jo chote uniton main 90 pratishat se lekar bade parinamitron main 98 pratishat tak vicharit hoti he
 General: The efficiency of the transformer expressed in percent can be expressed as: parinamitron kii taatkaalik dakshata or din bhar kii dakshata main antar hota he
 The control of the transformer means the relation of secondary voltage in the case of full load and secondary voltage in case of no load when the input voltage is constant
 pratishat ke rup main vyakt karne par niyantran ko adholikhit rup main paribhaashit kar sakate hai: Controls are of the order of 2 to 5 percent for small transformers and about 1 percent for elders
 transafarmar ke mukhyatah do bhaag hote hai: 1) Core - which is made of a magnetic material
 2) vinding - jo tanba, almunium yaa kisi anya suchalak ke taron athwa bas-baar se banaayi jaati he
 Apart from this, bad conductors are also used which prevent winding wheels from touching each other or from the core
 transformar tel kaa prayog ucch voltata ke parinamitron main kiya jaataa he jo brakedown shakti adhik hone se spark aadi rokte hai tathaa kor va kundliyon se ushma sokhkar use thanda karte hai
 Apart from oil and many other coolants are also used to keep the transformer cool, such as water and gas etc

 The opening and closing ceremonies, athletics and weightlifting were held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi, with a capacity of 75,000 spectators, which was completely renovated for these games
 kaamanwealth yaa rashtramandal game ek bahurashtriya khel aayojan he
 Along with this, many games are played simultaneously
 is khel main vah sabhi desh hissaa lete hai, jo olympic ke bhi sadsy hai
 It is held once every four years
 isamen vah sabhi khel khele jate hai jo olympic kaa hissaa hote hai saath hi rashtramandal khelon ke apane bhi kuch khaas khel hote hai
 The Commonwealth Games Association handles the control of this sporting event
 rashtramandal khelon kaa aayojan pehali baar varsh 1930 main hemilton shahar, onterio main yojit kiya gaya tha
 The sporting event was then called British Empire Games
 iske khel aayojan kaa mul vichaar ek bhartiya kaa tha jinka naam eshli kupar tha
 He proposed this event to the immediate politicians, considering this sporting event as right for mutual peace and harmony
 varsh 1928 main canada ke pramukh athlete bobi robinson ko pratham raashtra mandal khelon ke aayojan kaa bhaar saunpa gaya
 This sporting event was first started in 1930, in which 400 players from only 11 countries took part
 iske naam main bhi kai baar badlaav hue jaise 1954 main ise british empire or kaaman velth games ke naam se pukaara gaya to 1970 main british kaaman velth games se
 aakhirkaar varsh 1978 main ise sarvasammati se kaamanwealth games naam diya gaya
 The year 1998 saw a major change in the Commonwealth Games held in Kuala Lumpur when sports such as cricket, hockey and netball made their first appearance
 Although cricket is still not recognized
 jo baat in rashtramandal khelon ko baaki khel aayojanon se alag karti he vah he iskaa uddeshy or isaki niti
 Commonwealth Games considers three policies maanavtaa, samanta or niyati
 iskaa maananaa he ki isse vishvabhar main shanti or sahyog kii bhaavana badhegi
 yah nitiyaan hajaaron logon ko prerana detii hai or unhen aapas main jod kar rashtramandal deshon ke andar khelon ko apnaane kaa vyapak najariya pradaan karti hai
 Talking about its competitors, there are 6 countries which participate in it every year
 pichley yani melborn main hue kaaman velth games main sabhi 53 rashtramandal deshon sahit kul 71 deshon kii tiimon ne bhaag liya tha
 And yes, after the beginning of the year 1930, due to the Second World War, these games could not be organized between 1930-1942
 But in 1942, once again these games started being organized
 iske pratik or kuch anya tathy bhi bade rochak hai jaise maharani kii beton riley, pratik or logo aadi
 Let's have a look at these as well rashtramandal deshon kaa nirmaan britain ne kiya tha
 It includes all 53 countries that were once part of the British colonial system
 rashtramandal deshon ke nirmaan ke peeche uddeshy loktantr, sakshartaa, maanavadhikaar, behatar prashasan, mukt vyapaar or vishwa shanti ko badhaava dena tha
 a great tradition at the Commonwealth Games is the Queen's Baton Relay
 shuruyaat main riley kii jagah british jhande kaa upyog hota tha jise maharani ke haathon se lekar dhaavak daud lagaate the
 This flag represented the British sovereignty in these games
 magar 1950 ke baad riley kii shuruyaat hui jise dhavakon kaa ek dal buckingham pelas, britain se letaa he
 The relay traditionally begins with a launch event at Buckingham Palace, London, during which the Queen entrusts the baton with the message to the runner who is the first standard runner of the relay
 baad main is beton ko pratham grahan karne kaa adhikaar sabhi bady khel hastiyon ko de diya gaya
 In all the remaining countries, this relay is carried in turn according to the English alphabet
 rashtramandal khelon kaa koi bhi samaan pratik nahi hota he
 Every year the organizing countries choose this symbol according to themselves
 is varsh bharat main hone vaale rashtramandal khelon kaa pratik “shera” ko rakhaa gaya he
 Shera means lion
 It was revealed at the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne
 shera ko shaury, saahas, shakti or bhavyata kii nishaani mana jaataa he
 This orange and black striped lion reflects the spirit of India, while the story of its valor fills the players with the feeling of doing their best
 shera ko bade dil vaala mana jaataa he jo sabhi ko “aaen or khelen” kii bhaavana se bhar detaa he
 Like the symbol, its logo also does not remain the same, although the Union uses the logo of the Commonwealth countries for the same usage
 is varsh hone vaale khelon main logo ke rup main chakra kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 The Chakra is the national symbol of India's independence, unity and power
 yah sadaiv chalate rahane kii yaad dilaataa he
 Activated upwards, this Satranga Chakra is depicted in human form symbolizing bringing together India's diverse communities to energize the growth of a proud and colorful nation
 logo kii preranadai pankti ‘aaen or khelen’ he
