 There will be a need to amend the securities law and especially the SEBI Act which will facilitate India and SEBI to achieve the above objective

 pratibhuti bazaar main uplabdh niveshon ke vibhinn vikalpon or sadhano se judi jatiltaaon kii drushti se niveshak shiksha adhik praasangik he
 Retail investors are not in a position to identify and / or appreciate risk factors associated with certain shares or schemes
 jiske parinamswaroop ve gyaat nivesh nirnay lene main sakasham nahin hai
 Since the development of securities market depends to a large extent on proper education of investors, SEBI is committed to spread awareness among them
 2001 ke pratibhuti ghotaale par sanyukt sansadeey samiti kaa suzav tha ki niveshak shiksha or jaagrukta abhiyaan ko sucharu rup se chalaane main sebi ko sakasham banane ke liye, company adhinium kii dhara 205si ke tahat sthapit niveshak shiksha evam sangrakshan kosh or arabiai ke niveshak shiksha sansadhano ko sebi ko pradaan kar dena chahie or sebi ke netritv main niveshak shiksha or jaagrukta ke liye ek sanyukt abhiyaan shuru kiya janaa chahie
 The group said that most of the stakeholders agreed to set up a separate investor protection fund under the SEBI Act
 hitdharakon kii taraf se bhi yah suzav mila he ki kathith kosh ko khaas taur par niveshak shiksha ke prayojan, jaagrukta kaarykram kaa aayojan or niveshkon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye istemaal kiya janaa chahie
 The group also said that the proposed Investor Protection Fund is to fulfill the objective of investor education and awareness
 company adhinium kii dhara 55e kii drushti se sebi ko puunji ke vitaran, pratibhutiyon ke sthanantaran or soochibaddh companiyon or stock exange main apni pratibhutiyon ko soochibaddh karaane kii ichha rakhane vaali companiyon ke maamle main labhaansh ke gaiyr bhugtan ke sambandh main dhara 55e main vinirdeshit anubhaagon ke praavdhaanon ko prabhaav main laane kii jarurat he
 In addition, SEBI needs to implement measures to protect the interests of investors and address investor grievances by listed companies
 uparokt praavdhaanon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue samooh ne niveshak sangrakshan ke uddeshy se niveshkon ke liye muaavje ke bhugtan se sambandhit prastaav par bhi charchaa kii
 In this regard, the group also discussed the suggestion of setting up a fund similar to the Fair Fund established under the Sarbanes Oxley Act 2002 of the United States to compensate investors from the amount received as a penalty
 vichaar vimarsh ke dauraan ek anya vichaar bhi rakhaa gaya ki equity bazaar ke niveshak jokhim puunji main nivesh karte hai or kanoon ke tahat har ummid kii gaiyr purti ke liye koi aashwasit pratifal yaa muaavja nahin diya ja saktaa he
 However compensation related to fraud or misrepresentation or false statements made by companies or middlemen can be considered
 iske alaava samooh ne kaha ki pension fund yojanaon ke graahakon ke hiton kii raksha karne ke liye pension fund regulatory and deveopment othority ko anivaary banane vaale pension fund regulatory and deveopment othority adhyadesh 2004 ke tahat piefardie ko sabsakribar ajukeshan and protection fund kii sthapana karne kii anumati pradaan kii gai he
 The said ordinance also specifies the money that should be deposited in the alleged Subscriber Education and Protection Fund
 kathith adhyadesh ke praavdhaan ke mutabik adhyadesh ke tahat piefardie dwaara dand swarup vasuuli gai sabhi raashiyon ko sabsakribar ajukeshan and protection fund main jamaa kiya jayega
 The group felt that a separate fund could be set up under the SEBI Act, like the Subscriber Education and Protection Fund under the PFRDA Ordinance 2004, to be operated by SEBI to achieve the goal of investor protection by investor education and investor awareness
 And can be operated by SEBI for investor education and awareness
 iske alaava companiyon yaa bichauliyon dwaara kii gai dhokhadhadi yaa galatabayani yaa jhuthe bayanon ke sambandh main chote niveshkon kii kshatipurti ko kathith niveshak sangrakshan kosh ke baahar niveshak sangrakshan kaa ek vishay mana ja saktaa he
 In this regard, it may seem desirable that SEBI may specify guidelines and criteria for the operation of Investor Protection Fund for the purpose of payment of compensation to small investors and for the purpose of investor education and awareness
 is sambandh main, stock exange ke niveshak sangrakshan kosh ke sambandh main sebi dwaara jari dishanirdeshon ko aavashyak parivartanon ke saath apanaaya ja saktaa he
 Regarding the money to be deposited in the alleged Investor Protection Fund, the group noted the representation of the National Stock Exchange that large stock exchanges are using the money appropriately to meet the stated objective
 samooh ne yah bhi kaha ki chote stock exenjon ke ipief main pade hue paison kaa purna santosh ke saath istemaal nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 It is believed that the funds lying unutilized in the Investor Protection Fund of the stock exchanges for a long time should be transferred to the proposed Investor Protection Fund
 7 saal se adhik samay tak mutual fund or samuhik nivesh yojanaon yaa udhyam puunji koshon main pade hue laavaaris labhaansh or byaaj or bichauliyon ke paas pade hue graahakon ke laavaaris paison yaa pratibhutiyon kaa istemaal ek uddeshypurna tareeke se kiya janaa chahie
 Further, all the amounts recovered through penalty imposed by the Adjudicating Officer under Chapter VIA of SEBI Act should be deposited in the proposed Investor Protection Fund
 samooh ke suzav ke mutabik niveshak shiksha evam jaagrukta ke uddeshy se or companiyon yaa bichauliyon dwaara kii jane vaali dhokhadhadi yaa galatabayani yaa jhuthe bayanon ke sambandh main chote niveshkon kii kshatipurti ke liye piefardie adhyadesh 2004 ke tahat graahak shiksha evam sangrakshan kosh kii tarah sebi adhinium ke tahat ek alag niveshak sangrakshan kosh kii sthapana kii ja sakati he
 The said fund should be operated by SEBI to protect investors, as per the guidelines related to stock exchanges, as per the guidelines established by SEBI or set norms to measure investor education and awareness and to compensate small investors
 kathith kosh main jamaa kii jane vaali rashiyaan is prakaar hai:-a) 7 saal se adhik samay tak mutual fund or samuhik nivesh yojanaon yaa udhyam puunji kosh yojana main padaa hua laavaaris labhaansh yaa byaaj;b) 7 saal se adhik samay tak pratibhuti bazaar ke kisi bichauliye ke paas padaa hua kisi graahak kaa koi laavaaris paisa yaa pratibhuti;c) stock exenjon ke niveshak sangrakshan koshon main aprayukt pade hue paise;d) sebi adhinium ke adhyay viie ke tahat maudrik dand ke rup main vasuul kii gai sabhi rashiyaan

3 Nomination Facility The concept of nomination has been recognized under Section 109 of Companies Act 1956, Section 45ZA of Banking Regulation Act 1949 and Section 39A of UTI Act 1963
 purvokt praavdhaanon ke tahat shairdharak yaa dibenture dharak, jamakarta yaa unit dharak kaa ummidavaar vasiyat ke kanoon sahit lagu anya kisi bhi kanoon main shaamil hone ke baavjood anya sabhi vyaktiyon ko chhodkar mritak kii pratibhutiyon yaa paison kaa haqadaar hota he
 However, there is no provision in the SEBI Act for such nomination facility for unit holders of mutual funds and collective investment schemes
 samooh ne kaha ki sebi vinium 1996 main unit dharakon ke liye namakan suvidha kaa praavdhaan he
 The group felt that the provision of nomination facility is favorable for investors, but such provision should be in the original act and not in the regulations
 haalanki samooh aisa koi adhibhavi prabhaav pradaan karne ke paksh main nahin he jaisaa ki company adhinium 1956 kii dhara 109 ke tahat pradaan kiya jaataa he jahaan ummidavaar kaa adhikaar kanoonee vaaris ke daawey ko maat de saktaa he
 In view of the above facts, the Group recommends making suitable amendments to the SEBI Act to include a provision to provide nomination facility to unit holders of mutual funds and collective investment schemes
 samooh ko suchit kiya gaya ki sebi ko sebi adhinium evam viniyamon ke praavdhaanon kii vyakhya par agrim maargdarshan ke liye vibhinn bazaar pratibhaagiyon se anginat anurodh praapt hote hai
 Since the SEBI Act does not contain specific provisions like Section 245B to 245N of the Income Tax Act 1961 to give SEBI the authority to grant advance decisions, SEBI provided explanatory letter / 'no action' letter under the provisions of SEBI Scheme 2003 Developed a system of doing
 haalanki is yojana ke tahat die jane vaale dishanirdesh iskar adhinium ke tahat die jane vaale agrim vinirnay ke samaan nahin he kyonki yah sebi board ke liye baadhyatamoolak nahin he
 Advance rulings for the securities market will give the market participant the ability to obtain compulsory rulings on the applicability of the special provision of the securities law to him prior to the proposed transaction
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki agrim vinirnay pranali nishchit rup se kathith yojana ke tahat pradaan kiye jane vaale anaupchaarik maargdarshan se adhik behatar hoti he kyonki sebi dwaara pradaan kiya jane vaala agrim vinirnay iske board par badhyakaari hoga
 The binding effect not only provides more comfort to market participants but it also gives better legal status to the entire mechanism
 haalanki prachlit anaupchaarik maargdarshan yojana kii sucharu or santoshjanak kriyasheeltaa kii drushti se samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi ko is vikalp kaa bahut saavdhaanee se vishleshan karnaa chahie kyonki yojana se agrim vinirnay ke sthanantaran kii taraf uthne vaale kadam ke liye iskar adhinium kii tarah ek alag vibhaag or buniyadi dhaanche kii sthapana kerani padegi
 The Group suggests that since legally advance ruling is preferable, its approval can be considered and informal guidance scheme can also be continued
 samooh ne kaha ki sebi adhinium kii dhara 11 main esaro ko badhaava dene or use viniyamit karne kaa praavdhaan he
 However, there is no specific provision for empowering sros to create bye laws with statutory power for entry of members into the SEBI Act
 iske alaava company adhinium 1956 main shaamil hone ke baavjood sebi adhinium main sebi dwaara esaro ke shaasi board ke adhikraman se sambandhit yaa esaro ke sadasyon ke matadhikaron ko simit karne se sambandhit koi praavdhaan nahin he
 Such amendments have been proposed to provide such power to SEBI
 samooh ne kaha ki sebi ne esaro ke viniman ke liye sebi adhinium kii dhara 11 ke saath dhara 30 ke tahat pehle se hi viniyamon arthath sebi vinium 2004 ko taiyaar kar liya he jiske liye anya sabhi ikaayiyon ke saath esaro ko bhi sebi se manyata praapt karne kii jarurat he
 These regulations also provide the SRO with the power to formulate rules and bye-laws with the approval of SEBI
 esaro ko niyantrit karne vaale vinium ke vinium 23 main sebi ko manyata waapas lene kii shakti pradaan karne kaa praavdhaan he
 In view of the perceived power the group felt that SEBI already has the requisite power to compel the sros to regulate their activities as per the regulations
 natijatan iske liye sambhawatah sebi adhinium main sanshodhan karne kii koi jarurat nahin he
 According to the recommendation of the group, there is no need for a proposed amendment to the SEBI Act
 sebi dwaara taiyaar kiye gaye vinium esaro ke ek niamak ke rup main sebi kii chintaa ko dur karne ke liye paryaapt hona chahie
 The Group stated that there is no provision in the SEBI Act which empowers SEBI to rectify clear clerical or typographical errors in its own orders
 is vichaar ko bhi prakat kiya gaya ki sebi ko un maamalon main bhi apane khud ke adeshon kii samiksha karne kaa adhikaar nahin he jab un adeshon ko ekatarfa jari kiya gaya ho
 The group observed that the "review of orders" appears to confer fundamental powers that ordinarily the authorities with original jurisdiction do not have
 haalanki samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki bank evam vittiya santhaan baaki rin raashi vasuuli adhinium 1993 kii dhara 26 kii tarah sebi ko apane aadesh se judi lipic yaa tankan trutiyon ko thik karne kii kshamta pradaan kii jaani chahie
 Banks and financial institutions, like Section 26 of the Rest of the Loan Recovery Act 1993, should be amended to provide SEBI the ability to correct clerical or typographical errors associated with its order
 samooh ne kaha ki sebi adhinium ke maujuuda praavdhaanon main sebi ke paas bazaar pratibhaagiyon ko raahat pradaan karne ke simit uddeshy se purvyaapee prabhaav vaale viniyamon kaa nirmaan karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 The Group felt that SEBI has the power to create retrospective effect regulations in relation to procedural matters like the Income Tax Act or matters relating to fee charges for the limited purpose of providing relief and not to carry the burden of new liabilities and responsibilities
 Can be provided samooh ke mutabik is tarah ke udaar praavdhaan kuch maamalon main bazaar pratibhaagiyon kii anuchit pareshaani ko dur kar sakati he or isliye is par sakaaratmak dhyaan diya janaa chahie
 As per the recommendation of the group, SEBI is empowered to formulate regulations with due effect in respect of matters relating to procedural matters or fee charges for the limited purpose of providing limited relief and benefits and not to carry the burden of new liabilities and responsibilities
 To amend the SEBI Act in accordance with Section 295 of the Income Tax Act, 1961
 samooh ne pratibhutiyon ke maamle main anya kanoonon par sebi adhinium ko adhibhavi prabhaav pradaan karne ke liye sebi adhinium main sudhaar karne ke suzav par charchaa kii
 In evaluating the need for such amendments, the group tried to identify the fundamental provisions of the SEBI Act which would be able to achieve an overriding effect
 uchit soch vichaar karne ke baad samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi adhinium main aisa koi moulik praavdhaan nahin he jo ek adhibhavi prabhaav praapt karne ke laayak ho
 The group also said that the SEBI Act has already done this by non-mandatory clauses wherever the original provisions were capable of achieving overriding effect
 samooh kii sifarish ke anusaar anya kanoonon par sebi adhinium ko adhibhavi prabhaav pradaan karne ke liye sebi adhinium main sanshodhan nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 The group examined the proposal to amend the provisions of the SEBI Act to provide statutory authority to SEBI to issue circulars and guidelines
 samooh ne kaha ki sebi adhinium kii dhara 11 ke tahat paripatron or dishanirdeshon ko jari karata rahaa he
 The Group felt that there is no legal difficulty in issuing circulars or guidelines under the existing provisions of Section 11, the source of the inherent rights of SEBI
 samooh kii sifarish ke mutabik paripatr or dishanirdeshon ko jari karne ke liye sebi adhinium main ek vishisht praavdhaan shaamil karne ke liye ise sanshodhit nahin kiya ja saktaa he kyonki sebi ko pehle se hi sebi adhinium kii dhara 11 ke tahat aisa karne kaa anternihit adhikaar praapt he
 The group was told that in cases of fraudulent issuance of securities and excessive dematerialization of securities, SEBI should be empowered to declare such transactions void
 kisi vishisht vinium ke ulanghan kii sthiti main is tarah ke lendenon ko shunya ghoshit karne ke liye esasiare kii dhara 9 or dhara 14 kii tarah sebi adhinium main upyukt praavdhaan kiya janaa chahie
 The group felt that such power should be exercised by an independent body, especially civil courts
 prashasnic nikaayon ko is tarah kaa adhikaar nahin diya ja saktaa he
 The SEBI Act should not be amended under the given proposal
 is tarah kii shakti yaa adhikaar ko khaas taur par naagarik adaalat ke liye chhod diya janaa chahie
 The group was told that one of the principles of the Securities Regulations, as per the specifications of IOSCO / FSAP, is that the process of dealing with the failure of a market intermediary should be arranged to minimize the loss and loss of investors and involve systematic risk 
 samooh ne kaha ki kisi bichauliye ke diwalia hone yaa is tarah ke bichauliye kii nirantarata ko niveshkon yaa is tarah ke bichauliye ke graahakon ke hit ke liye hanikaarak maane jane par is tarah ke bichauliye ke samaapan ke liye kadam uthaane ke liye sebi adhinium ke tahat sebi ko koi vishesh adhikaar pradaan nahin kiya gaya he
 The group said that the Reserve Bank of India has the authority to file a winding up petition against the non-banking finance company under Section 45 MC of the RBI Act
 samooh ne mahasoos kiya ki sebi ke paas sebi adhinium ke tahat samaapan yachika daayar karne kaa samatuly adhikaar hona chahie
 Further, the Group observed that in case of winding up of such intermediary company, the claims of customers of such intermediaries should also be preferred over other claims or debts ie secured creditors and sovereign authorities like income tax
 is sambandh main samooh ne kaha ki banking niyaman adhinium 1949 kii dhara 43e ke tahat banking company kii parisampattiyon main se anya sabhi karjon main jamakartaon ke adhimaanya bhugtan ko praathamikta dene kaa praavdhaan he
 The Group felt that SEBI would be empowered to file a winding-up petition against such intermediaries if any middleman is deemed to be insolvent or the continuation of such intermediary is detrimental to the interest of the investors or the customers of such intermediaries
 Similar provisions should be made in relation to the claims of customers of time intermediary companies
 samooh kii sifarish ke anusaar sebi ko bhartiya reserve bank adhinium kii dhara 45emasi or banking niyaman adhinium kii dhara 43e kii tarj par madhyasth companiyon ke sambandh main samaapan yachika daayar karne main sakasham banane ke liye sebi adhinium main upyukt praavdhaan kiya ja saktaa he
 The group stated that an IOSCO principle for securities market regulations is that investors' funds should be kept separate from the assets of other entities through the regulatory system
 iske alaava insidar trading, graahakon ke saamne front running yaa trading or graahak kii parisampattiyon ke durupyog sahit bhraamak gatividhiyon, herpher yaa dhokhadhadi se niveshkon kii raksha kii jaani chahie
 The group was told that the Securities Laws Bill 2003, a section 27B, was proposed to be included in the Securities Contract Act under which an investor could transfer his money or securities to an intermediary company that would hold such money or securities
 And who will use them according to the instructions of the investors
 is tarah ke paise yaa pratibhutiyaan madhyasth companiyon kii parisampattiyon kaa hissaa nahin hogi or kisi bhi praadhikari dwaara niveshkon kii aisi parisampattiyon ko jabt nahin kiya jayega yaa aisi parisampattiyon ke saath kisi bhi praadhikari kaa koi sambandh nahin hoga
 However the Securities Laws Act 2005 did not include this provision
 samooh ne kaha ki kisi niveshak dwaara kisi madhyasth company ko saunpe gaye paison yaa pratibhutiyon ko aise niveshkon ke vishwasit madhyasth company dwaara dhaaran kiya janaa chahie
 Such money or securities of the investors should not be made part of the assets of the intermediary company and these assets of the investors will not be seized by any authority or have anything to do with any authority that is under the protection of such intermediary company or Be in possession samooh kii sifarish ke mutabik sebi adhinium main ek vishesh praavdhaan hona chahie jiske tahat graahakon ke paison yaa pratibhutiyon ko madhyasth companiyon dwaara ek trust ke rup main dhaaran kiya janaa chahie or madhyasth company ke kabje main rahane vaali niveshkon kii parisampattiyon par kisi praadhikari kaa koi kabza yaa koi len-dein nahin hoga
 To fulfill this objective, the proposed provision in the Securities Laws Bill 2003 can be introduced

 In addition, Munro and others felt that the ryotwari was closer to the traditional field of practice and ideologically more progressive, with the emergence of a section of society
 Allowed the benefits of the company rule to reach the lowest level of Ramine society
 At the heart of the Ryotwari system was a particular theory of economic rent and based on the usefulness of David Ricardo's Rent Law, James Mill formulated the Indian Income Policy between 1819 and 1830
 "unhone kaha ki sarkaar mitti ke param prabhu kaa maananaa tha ki or 'kiraye' ke apane adhikaar kaa tyaag nahin karnaa chahie, yani mazdooree or anya sanchaalan vyay ko sulajhaa liya gaya tha jab amir dharti par upar chhod diya he laabh

 According to Mill, the taxation of land rents would promote efficient agriculture and simultaneously prevent the emergence of a "parasitic landlord
" The mill government relied on each plot of measurement and evaluation and on soil fertility, which later The ryotwari settlements which consisted of taxation advocated
 The amount paid was nine tenths of the "rent" in the early 19th century and gradually fell later
 However, the essence of the ryotwari system is Siddha

 In 1772, when Warren Hastings was appointed Governor General of the First Fort William with the capital of the Presidency in Kolkata, one of his first undertakings was the rapid expansion of the Army of the Presidency
 Available troops, or soldiers, from Bengal, many of whom had fought against the British since the Battle of Plassey were now in doubt in British eyes, recruited farther west from Hastings to be "the principal breeding ground of India's infantry in the eastern Oudh and vicinity The Land of Banaras
 " The upper caste rural Hindu Rajputs and Brahmins continued to practice this for the next 75 years, with the East India Company of the region comprising these troops dependent on eighty percent of the Bengal Army, for two hundred years the armies were recruited by the Mughals

 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience
 atah, vinay ke niyam main parimarjan / parivartan, sthaneey saanskrithik / bhashik paksh, vyaktigat dharm kaa swatantrata, dharm ke nishchit paksh main zyada vaa kam jod aadi kaaran se buddha dharm main vibhinn sampradaay vaa sangh main parimarjeet hue
 Presently, the major sect or creed in these sanghas are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana
 bharat main buddha dharm kaa navyan sampradaay he jo purnat shuddh, maanavtaavaadi or vigyaanvaadee he
 Template: Main: Theravada saanchaa:main:mahayan Template: Main: Vajrayana saanchaa:main:navyan Five main shrines are considered to be main for followers of Lord Buddha around the world: yah sthaan nepal kii tarai main nautanwaan railway stesan se 25 kilometre or gorakhpur-gonda line ke naugarh stesan se kareeb 12 kilometre dur he
 Now a paved road has also been built from Naugarh to Lumbini

 However, most of the ancient viharas of Buddha's time here have been destroyed

 Apart from this pillar there is a statue of Buddha in a Samadhi Stupa
 nepal sarkaar ne bhi yahaan par do stupa or banawaye hai
 Even after wandering near various places and various gurus for six years, Buddha did not get the ultimate knowledge anywhere
 iske baad ve gaya pahunche
 In the end, he vowed that until real knowledge is available, he will not rise from under the Peepal tree, even if he dies
 iske baad kareeb chah din tak din raat ek pipal vriksh ke neeche bhukhe-pyaase tap kiya
 Eventually he attained supreme knowledge or wisdom

 Scenic objects of Sarnath include Chaturmukh Singh pillar of Ashoka, ancient temple of Lord Buddha, Dhamek Stupa, Chaukhandi Stupa, etc

 Justin Chang of Variety commented "your praise has movie is ultimately undone; There is no room for a mutual melding of characters and stories, and even the most noticeably repetitive scenes are slippery and fragmented, "and Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote," The real disappointment is that the film has left viewers in another world Not sent, as did 300

 " Analyzing the split reaction, Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times felt that, like Eyes Wide Shut, The Passion of the Christ or Fight Club, Watchmen would continue to be a talking point among those who liked or did not like the film
 According to Boucher, despite her mixed feelings about the entire film, she was "oddly proud" of the director's credible conversion, causing it to be "nothing less than the fearless popcorn films to date

 The self-employed Woman's Association was started by Ila Bhatt in 1971 with only seven members
 aaj iske saath teraa lakh se zyaada striyaan judi hai
 This organization runs its own bank of illiterate working women, through which women are provided capital for self-employment
 yah nari andolan, mazdoor andolan or sahakaarita andolan kaa ek sangam he
 Born on 7 September 1933 in Ahmedabad, Ila Bhatt spent her childhood in Surat city where her father Sumat Bhatt was a successful lawyer
 maan vanalila vyas mahilaon ke andolan main sakriy thim
 Ila Bhatt's family members also participated in India's freedom struggle
 unke naanaa mahatma gandhi ke namak satyagrah main shaamil the or iske liye jail bhi gayi the
 In 1952 Ila graduated in Arts from MTB College, Surat and then completed law in 1954 from Ahmedabad where she was also awarded a Gold Medal for her work on Hindu Law
 kuch dinon ke liye unhone shrimati nathibai damodar thakare mahila vishvavidhyalay, mumbai main angrezi padhaane kaa kaam kiya
 During her graduation, Ila met Ramesh Bhatt, a fearless student leader
 1951 main bharat kii pehali janaganana ke dauraan maili-kuchaili bastiyon main rahane vaale pariwaron kaa vivaran darj karne ke liye ramesh bhatta ne ila ko apane saath kaam karne ke liye aamantrit kiya to ila ne bahut sankoch se iske liye sahamat huin
 He knew that his parents would not like to see their daughter wandering in slums with an unknown young man
 baad main jab ila ne ramesh bhatta se shaadi karne kaa nishchay kiya to mata-pita ne virodh kiya
 He was afraid that his daughter would live in poverty for a lifetime
 itane virodh ke baavjood bhi ila ne san 1955 main ramesh bhatta vivaah kar liya

 But Ansuiya Sarabhai was also a woman to establish the first trade union in India

 In 1971, migrant women porters of Ahmedabad's market handcart and head load carried the help of Ila Bhatt in search of a roof over their heads
 ila bhatta ne dekha ki ye sari mahilaayein khuli sadak par rahane ko majaboor hai or inaki mazaduri behad kam he
 He wrote on this subject in local newspapers
 kapadaa vyapaariyon ne javaabi lekh prakashit karke ila bhatta ke saare aaropon ko kaarij kar diya or mahila kuliyon ko uchit mazaduri dene kaa daawa kiya
 Ila Bhatt got many copies of the articles of the traders and distributed them to the women porters so that they asked the traders for the wages printed in the newspaper
 ila bhatta kii is yukti se kapadaa vyapaariyon kii hekdi nikal gayi
 He offered talks to Ila Bhatt
 disambar, 1971 main isi baithak ke liye sau mahila mazdoor jutin or seva sanghathan kaa janm hua
 When there was an idea to register the service as a labor organization, the Labor Department flatly refused
 tark yah tha ki shramik sanghathan bananaa he to pehle maalik kaa naam bataaya jaae jahaan ye log naukari par he
 All members of the service were unorganized women laborers
 inke paas koi niyamit naukari nahin thi
 Only after a long debate did the service become a registered labor organization
 1981 main aarakshan ke virodh main ucch jatiyon ne pichhadi jati ke logon ke saath marpet kii
 The service strongly opposed the violence against backward and scheduled castes, while the textile workers union remained silent
 ila bhatta dwaara asangathit mahila mazaduron ke liye ladane, pichhadi jatiyon kaa samarthan karne jaise kaaryon se kapadaa kaamgaar sangh kaa purushavaadi, jativaadee netritv itnaa kshubdh ho gaya ki unhone seva ko apane sanghathan se hi nishkasit kar diya
 According to Ila Bhatt, this removal proved to be a boon
 iske baad seva nari andolan, mazdoor andolan va sahakaarita andolan kaa sangam ban gayi
 The main goal of Ila Bhatt's organization service is to connect women with full employment
 sampoorn rojgaar kaa matlab keval naukari nahin; balki naukari ke saath khaadya-suraksha or saamaajik suraksha bhi he
 This means engaging workers in activities that make them self-reliant
 yah teen baton kendrit he aajeevika kaa nirmaan, maujuuda aajeevika kii suraksha or pragati ke liye kaarykushalta main vruddhi
 The service also provides support services such as housing, savings and loans, pension and insurance to its members
 iske alaava bacchon kii dekhbhaal tathaa kanoonee sahaayta bhi detii he
 The service has offered many examples of system change
 jaise, gujarat ke mehsana zile main bhoomihin dalit striyon kii krishi samiti vanalakshmi
 The women of this committee collect rainy water in a pond covered with plastic sheets so that they can be irrigated even during the summer days
 ye mahilaayein power tiller bhi chalaati hai
 Farmers from nearby villages come to see and learn in Vanlakshmi
 isi tarah banaaskaantha ke sookhe registani ilaake main striyon kaa zamin par adhikaar nahin tha
 For this, they could have to struggle for many decades
 lekin shramjivi striyon ke sanghathan dwaara nirmit mahila pani panchayat ne striyon ko pani kaa maalik banaaya
 Due to the ownership of this water, she also became the owner of the land
 pani ke madhyam se mili niyantran ke kaaran gaanv ke purush pradhan satta sambandhon main bhi badlaav aayaa
 The biggest achievement in this regard has been that the spread of the desert was stopped by planting thirty five million trees
 pehle sthaneey log yahan se baahar ja kar roti-rozi kii jugad karne ko majaboor the, lekin ab halaat badal gayi hai
