 Lord Krishna himself has said this to Arjuna
 katha ke anusaar bhagwaan arjuna se kehete hai, raja mandhata ne ek samay main lomash rishi se jab poocha ki prabhu yah bataaen ki manushya jo jane anjaane paap karm karata he usase kaise mukt ho saktaa he
 In response to King Mandhata's question, the Lomash sage told a story to the king that in the beautiful forest called Chaitratha, the meritorious sage, son of Chyavan Rishi, was absorbed in penance
 is van main ek din manjughosha naamak apsara kii nazar rishi par padi to vah unpar mohit ho gayi or unhen apni ore aakarshith karne hetu ytn karne lagi
 Cupid was also passing by at that time that his eyes went to Apsara and he understood his feelings and started helping him
 apsara apane ytn main safal hui or rishi kampidit ho gayi
 The sage forgot the fast of penance of Shiva and started Ramana with Apsara
 kai varshon ke baad jab unki chetana jaagi to unhen ehsaas hua ki vah shiv kii tapasya se virat ho chuke hai unhen tab us apsara par bahut krodh hua or tapasya bhang karne kaa doshi jaanakar rishi ne apsara ko shraap de diya ki tum pishaachini ban jaao
 Saddened by the curse, she fell at the sage's feet and began to pray for freedom from the curse
 medhaavi rishi ne tab us apsara ko vidhi sahit caitra krishna ekadshi kaa vrath karne ke liye kaha
 Due to being immersed in the enjoyment, the sage's glory was also lost, so the sage also fasted on this Ekadashi which destroyed his sin
 udhar apsara bhi is vrath ke prabhaav se pishaach yoni se mukt ho gayi or use sundar rup praapt hua va swarg ke liye prasthaan kar gayi
 The subject of this fast is described in detail in the Bhavishya Purana

 Eat a satvik meal once on the fasting day of the fast and remove the feeling of enjoyment from the mind and put the mind in Hari

 It is criticized that this is why his writing became profound and lacked originality

 He also wrote on many untouched subjects, poets are discovered and their talent is seen in historical essays
 babu shyaam sundar das kii bhashaa shuddh saahitiyik hindi he, jisamen sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon kii pradhanta he
 In relation to the language, his idea was - 'when we accept foreign words with foreign expressions, then make them so that the foreignness comes out of them and they become disciplined by our grammar rules
 ' isliye jahaan kahin unhone apni bhashaa main 'urdu' ke prachlit shabdon kaa prayog kiya he, vahaan unka urdupan nikaal diya he, kalam, kavayad, kanoon aadi shabdon ke neeche kii bindi hataakar or unke uccharan badal kar unhone unka prayog liya he
 Similarly, by removing the rarity of Sanskrit words, they are written in Hindi in a simple way - like work in place of work, anjan in place of anjan
 shabd chayan ke bare main babu shyamsundar das kaa mat tha- 'sabase pehla sthaan shuddh hindi ke shabdon ko, uske peeche sanskrit ke sugam or prachlit shabdon ko, iske peeche farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke saadhaaran or prachlit shabdon kaa or sabase peeche sanskrit ke aprachlit shabdon ko sthaan diya jaae

 sahitya ke samast kshetron ke abhaavon ko dur karne ke liye unhone sankalpabaddh hokar shram kiya
 Due to his achievements as a language philosopher or as a lecturer of the principles, literary literature remained a destiny of Hindi students for a long time
 inke man main yah dharna nirbhaant rahi ki hindi kii saidhantik samiksha kaa aadhaar sanskrit or pashchimi aalochana-siddhanton ko mila kar or unhen ek khaas saamanjasy ke saath hi banaaya janaa chahie

 Ransomware is a type of malicious ransom software
 ise is tarah se banaaya jaataa he ki vah kisi bhi computer system ke sabhi filon ko inkript kar de
 As soon as the software encrypts these files, it starts asking for a ransom and threatening that if not paid that much, it will ruin all the files on the computer
 iske baad in filon tak computer upyogkarta tab tak dekh yaa upyog nahin kar saktaa jab tak vah phiroti main maangi gai raashi kaa bhugtan na kar de
 The special thing is that in this the time limit is set for repaying the ransom amount and if no one pays the money in time, then the ransom amount increases for that
 is tarah ke software kii avadharana kaa avishkaar or ise purna karne kaa kaary yang or yung ne colombia vishvavidhyalay main kiya tha
 They presented it at the IEEE Security and Privacy Conference in 1996
 ise kryptoviral phiroti kaha jaataa he
 It establishes protocol between the attacker and the victim by the three chakras
 system main ghusane ke liye ransamaware ke hamalon main aamtaur par trogen virus kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Such viruses are targeted as a file on the Internet or a low-security network to carry it to the computer's system
 yadi aapane agyaat sthaan se koi file downlod kii he yaa network seva kii suraksha main koi chook ho to aapke network ko bhi nishaanaa bana kar yah virus aapke computer tak le jaaya ja saktaa he
 After such virus enters your computer, it locks the computer or simply claims that the computer is locked
 is tarah ke daawa karne vaale ko scamaware kaha jaataa he
 Scamware also makes a number of false claims that it is from a law enforcement agency and says that some illegal activities have been carried out from your computer
 pisi par ransamaware kii ghatana prasiddh hone ke baad hi ab mobile ko lakshith kiya ja rahaa he
 Usually, ransomware in mobile does not encrypt any data, because one can easily get all the necessary data of the mobile through sync
 is kaaran isamen ek tarah ke block karne kii takanic kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jisase koi mobile kaa upyog na kar sake
 This type of mobile ransomware primarily makes Android phones a victim, as one can easily download and install apps from other unknown sources
 iske liye isamen 
apk fil kaa upyog hota he, jo kisi anya tarah se upyog karne vaale dwaara daalaa jaataa he ki use pataa bhi na chale ki isamen koi ransamaware jaisaa kuch he
 But an app does not have all the rights, so that it can prevent the mobile from being used, thus such apps give the message of blocking on all other apps as well
 jabaki kuch alag prakaar ke ransamaware bhi hote hai, jo idhar udhar clic karaane kaa kaary karte hai, jisase unhen mobile main kuch bhi karne kaa adhikaar mil jaye
 In this way they reach inside the mobile system
 android kii tarah hi ioes main iskaa khatra he, lekin isamen ve duusare tareeke kaa upyog karte hai
 In this, they prevent the use of its system by icloud and Find My Phone, etc

 This generates a 2048-bit RSA key pair, allowing the file to be encrypted
 yadi koi rakam teen dinon ke andar nahin detaa he to yah privet kii ko hataa detaa he
 Due to its large size, it becomes very difficult to fix
 teen din se zyada hone ke baad bhi aap privet kii praapt kar sakate hai
 But for this you will have to pay more
 rakam bad kar 10 bitakoin ho jaataa he, jo navambar 2013 ke anusaar $2300 america dollar ke baraabar he
 Another key ransomware is the Trojan, which makes Windows-based devices vulnerable

 It was featured on several large websites around the end of September 2014 by Jedo Advertising Network
 koi bhi vigyaapan main clic karata tha to vah use ek website main le jaataa tha, jo brouzar ke plagain kaa upyog downlod karne ke liye karata tha

 unhone kaha bhi tha ki- "qamar band lo bhavi ghumkkadon, sansar tumhaare swaagat ke liye bekaraar he
 "rahul, while assimilating the experiences of his journey, also composed the 'nomads'

 iskaa kshetra kabhi asadabad zile kaa bhaag hua karata tha
 It has about 60 large villages scattered across the valleys and mountainous regions of the province
 yahan sadak-vyavastha aviksit he or prantiya rajdhani asadabad se un tak pahunchne main kabhi-kabhi ek puraa din lag jaataa he
 The district is divided by the Perch River running east-west and the Tregami River north-south
 vatapur gaanv zile kii rajdhani he or in dono nadiyon ke sangam-sthal ke paas basaa hua he
 The Tregami Valley is narrow and hilly in the north but broad in the south and runs agriculture
 zile ke adhiktar log pashtun hai or pashto bolte hai, lekin uttari bhaag main nuristaani logon ke teen gaanv hai jo tregami bhashaa bolte hai
 The Vatapuri language was once spoken in the village of Vatapur, which was the language of the Dardi branch of the indo-aryan language family, but is now extinct

 a river in Vatapur district mulkanah gaanv main kheton main chalate do afakhaan aadmi In the 18th century, the houses were in some way the centers of formal music-education, but with the emergence of the British rule, the outline of the houses started to relax somewhat because the administrators of Western culture gave more recognition to scientific progress than art and this culture rather than spirituality
 Materialism prevailed
 bhartiya samskruti kii aadhyatmik prishthbhumi ke antargat kala ko jo pavitrataa evam aasthaa kaa sthaan praapt tha tathaa jise kuch musalmaan shaskaon ne bhi prashray diya or sangeet ko manoranjan kaa upkaran maanate hue bhi iske sadhana paksh ko vismrit na karte hue sangitagnon tathaa shaastrakaron ko rajya athwa riyasaton kii ore se sahaayta de kar sangeet ke vikasaatmak paksh ko vismrit nahin kiya
 But the administrators of the British state adopted a materialistic approach towards the art of music, although it was considered as part of the development of personality, but this approach was not situated on the ground of spirituality
 unhone anya vishyon ke samaan hi ek vishay ke rup main hi ise sweekaar kiya, parantu vaigyanik pragati kii prabhaavashiltaa ke kaaran yah vishay anya paathya vishyon ke bich lagbhag upekshit hi rahaa
 With a view to the revival of music at this time, as the last link of the houses, Pt
 Bharatkhande and Pt
 Vishnu Digambar Paluskar were two such great musicians who worked hard for the revival of music and keeping the spiritual level of music strong
 Significantly contributed to make everyone accessible

 Pt
 Vishnu Digambar also made available musical material for the students by writing books like 'sangeet Bal Prakash', 'sangeet Bal Bodh' etc
 and independently creating a lyrical system through it to symbolize the subtle divisions of tone and rhythm
 Worked to indicate and provide protection to the captured prisoners
 iske atirikt in donon mahaan vibhootiyon ke prayatnon se anek sangeet vidhyalay sthapit kiye gaye
 The end of the 18th century and the beginning of the twentieth century are considered to be the period of revival of Indian music
 is samay vah kala jo sabhy samaaj se bahishkrut va tiraskrit hokar raja maharaajaaon kii vilaspurn manoranjan kaa saadhan ban kar rah gai thi
 The favorable religious, social, political and cultural environment led to an extraordinary consciousness, the best example of which was the first music school in Baroda, founded by the late Maulabakhsh Visse Khan in 1886, later known as the 'baroda State Music School'
 yah vidhyalay baroda riyasat kii ore se pradaan kii gai aarthik sahaayta se sanchalit kiya jaataa tha
 The 'gandharva Mahavidyalaya', established in Lahore in 1901, was a revolutionary test in the field of music education, in which there was a unique co-ordination of the ancient Gurukul system and modern institutional learning system
 is vidhyalay main nishchit samay par aakar seekhney vaale jigyaasuon ke atirikt kuch aise bhi vidhyaarthee the jo ashramavaasiyon ke rup main rah kar guru ke sinadhya main dirghakaal tak sangeet kii sadhana karte the
 In fact, there was another Indian musical spirituality in front of Pt
 Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, on the other hand, there was a system of colleges etc
 established in the form of Christian missionary institutions established by the then British Government, in which education was a human goal and the primacy of service
 Therefore, on May 5, 1901, 'gandharva Mahavidyalaya' was established in Lahore with the aim that with satvic attitude
 Artists with rich music should teach pure Indian music for the purpose of human service

 Giving special importance to discipline, sobriety, orderliness and order and imparting music education inspired by the education of religious rites was its main goal
 sangeet shiksha ko saamaajik sangrakshan pradaan karne kii drushti se yah vidhyalay samaaj kii dhan-raashi par hi ashrith tha
 The money that was received from the public by organizing concerts itself was spent again at the school level because Panditji's aim was not to earn money but to make music education a prestigious place in society like other schools

 Although Vishnu Digambarji was a follower of the Gwalior gharana, the 'gandharva Mahavidyalaya' established at his doorstep was not established as an institution to expand the tradition of specific singing or to solicit singing of the Gwalior gharana itself, but only for its purpose
 Promote musicians in the field of music, benefit from musicians in music teaching work, and no
 To establish reputation in society Itkaron and music all work had to acceptable socially at the same level as other arts and disciplines
 at: sangeet ke prati aasthaa rakhane vaala jigyaasu kisi bhi gharaane yaa kisi bhi sampradaay kaa anuyaayi kyon na ho, is sanstha main sangeet seekhney kaa adhikari ho saktaa tha
 In this way, after learning music from Vishnu Digambarji's Gharana tradition, he made a great contribution in the promotion and propagation of music education as an institutional education
 gandharv mahavidhyalay mandal kii safalataa kaa anumaan is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki praarambhik se lekar vishaarad, alankaar evam acharya str kii pariksha tak gandharv mahavidhyalay ke lagbhag 450 kendron kii ore se lagbhag tees hajaar parikshaarthi prativarsh pariksha dete hai

 rodhi mandaryal block se 10 kilometre kii duri par karanpur maarg par sthit he yah mandaryal kii ek gram panchayat he The rise of Islam occurred in the Arabian Peninsula in the seventh century
 iske antim nabi mohammad sallallahu alaihi vasallam kaa janm 570 isvi main makka main hua tha
 Around 613 AD, Muhammad Sahib began to preach his wisdom to the people
 isi ghatana kaa islam kaa aarambh jaataa he
 However, till this time it was not seen as a new religion
 parvarti varshon main muhammd s0 ke anuyaayiyon ko makka ke logon dwaara virodh tathaa muhammd ke madina prasthaan se hi islam ko ek dharmik sampradaay mana gaya
 Over the next few years many enlightened people became followers of Muhammad
 unke anuyaayiyon ke prabhaav main aakar bhi kai log musalmaan bane
 After this Muhammad sahib returned to Mecca and conquered Makkah without fighting and all the opponents of Mecca were pardoned
 is maafi kii ghatana ke baad makka ke sabhi log islam main parivartit hue
 But Pember faced many protests and negative situations, but he squeezed the positivity out of every negativity, which led to his victory in every sphere of life
 unki vafaat ke baad arabon kaa samrajya or jazbaa badhata hi gaya
 The Arabs first conquered Egypt and North Africa and then defeated the Byzantine and Persian empires
 europe main to unhen vishesh safalataa nahin mili par faras main kuch sangharsh karne ke baad unhen jeet milane lagi
 After this, his empire failed in the east
 san 1200 tak ve bharat tak pahunch gaye
 
 hazrat mohammad sahab kaa janm 570 i
 main "makka" main hua
 Your family dominated a large religious site in Mecca
 us samay arab main yahudee, isai dharm or bahut saare samooh jo murtipujak the qabeelon ke rup main the
 At this time people gathered in Kaaba in Mecca and mass worship was done
 aapane kaadija naam kii ek vidhwaa vyapaaree ke liye kaam karnaa aarambh kiya
 Later, at the age of 25, he married her
 san 613 main aapane logon ko ye bataanaa aarambh kiya ki unhen parameshwar se yah sandesh aayaa he ki ishwar ek he or wo insaanon ko sachai tathaa eemaandaaree kii raah par chalane ko kahata he
 He also opposed idolatry
 par makka ke logon ko ye baat pasand nahin ai
 Muhammad Sahab had to leave Mecca in 622
 muslmaan is ghatana ko hijra kehete hai or yahaan se islamic calendar hijri aarambh hota he
 In the next few days, he had many followers in Medina, then he returned to Mecca and defeated the rulers of Mecca in battle
 iske baad kai log unke anuyaayi ho gaye or unke samarthakon ko musalmaan kaha is dauraan unhen kai virodhon tathaa ladaayeeyaan ladani padi
 First of all, there was a battle of Badr with cousins of his own clan - in which an army of 313 defeated the invasion of about 900 people
 iske baad arab prayadweep ke kai hisson main jaakar virodhiyon se yuddh hue
 Jews and some Christians also lived in Mecca and Medina at that time
 par us samay unako ek alag dharm ko rup main na dekh kar ishwar kii eksatta ke samarthak mana jaataa tha
 Hazrat Muhammad Makkah returned
 logon ko aisa lag rahaa tha ki bada yuddh hoga, laqin koi yuddh nahin hua, log shantipurvak hi rahe, or mohammad sahab or unke anuyai makkah main pravesh kiya
 In this way Makkah became independent without any war
 mohammad sahab kii makka vaapasi islam ke itihaas main ek mahatvapurn ghatana thi jisase ek sampradaay ke rup main na rah kar yah baad main ek dharm ban gaya
 In 632, you had a problem
 us samay tak sampoorn arab prayadweep islam ke sutara main bandha chukaa tha
 In 632, when Prophet Muhammad died, fear of fragmentation of Muslims arose
 koi bhi vyakti islam kaa vaid uttaradhikari nahin tha
 This successor would also own such a large empire
 isse pehle arab log bagentine yaa farsi senaaon main ladaako ke rup main ladate rahe the par khud kabhi itane bade samrajya ke maalik nahin bane the
 At the same time an institution of Khilafat was formed which decided who is the successor of Islam
 muhammd sahab ke dost abu bakar ko mohammad kaa uttaradhikari ghoshit kiya gaya
 The fourth Khalifa Ali was a supporter of Muhammad Sahab and married Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad Sahab
 par iske baavjood unke khilaafat ke samay tisare khalipha osman ke samarthakon ne unke khilaafat to chunauti di or arab samrajya main grihayuddh chhid gaya
 Ali was assassinated in 961 and Mu'awiya, a close relative of Osman, declared himself a Khalifa
 isi samay se umeyyad vansh kaa aarambh hua
 It bears its name on the family who played a major role in the battle with Muhammad Sahib before Mecca surrendered to Islam
 jald hi arab samrajya ne bagentine samrajya or saasaani samrajya kaa rup le liya
 Khilafat started transferring from father to son
 rajdhani damishq banaai gai
 The Umayyads preferred the Arabs very much in the empire, but the Arabs criticized them
 arabon kaa kahana tha ki ummayadon ne islam ko bahut hi sansaarik bana diya he or unamem islam ke mul main kii gai baaten kam hoti ja rahi hai
 Together these Muslims considered Ali to be the rightful caliph of Islam
 unhen laga ki ali hi islam kaa vaastavik uttaradhikari ho sakate the
 In 940, a Persian Muslim convert named Abu Muslim created a huge public against the Umayyads
 usne khorasaan main ummayadon ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Already there was resentment against the presence of Arabs in Khorasan, so he got massive public support
 usne yah kahkar logon ko ummyadon ke khilaaf saavdhaan kiya ki ve log islam ke sahi vaaris nahin hai or ve satta kaa durupyog kar rahe hai
 The luxury lifestyle of the Umayyads instigated them even more
 san 949-950 ke bich ummayadon dwaara bheje gaye sainikon ko haraa diya or iske baad apana ek nayaa khalipha ghoshit kar diya - abul abbaas
 Abbas was of Muhammad's lineage but was linked to Muhammad by another brother besides Ali
 par usase abu islam kii lokapriyata dekhi nahin gai or usne abu ko phaansi par lataka diya
 This led to anger among the people against Abbas
 jin logon ko abbaas par bhi bharosa nahin hua ve shiya bane - aaj iran kii 92 % janata shiya he
 However, Abbas and his descendants made their capital in Baghdad and ruled for the next nearly 500 years
 abbasiyon ke samay main iraniyon ko bhi samrajya main bhagidaari mili
 Although he did not hold any religious position, Iranians got the support of the government due to their good in arts like architecture and poetry
 dhyaan rahe ki kai madhyakaalin islamic vichaarak, jyotishi or kavi isi samay paidi hue the
 Omar Khayyam invented a new height in eastern Iran in astrology - a new almanac
 unhone kavitaaon kii rubaai style main maharath hasil kii or vigyaan main kai yoga daan die - jisamen bijganit or khanij-shaastra bhi shaamil hai
 Persian poets like Firdausi and Sufi thinkers like Rumi were born at this time
 haalanki inamen se adhiktar ko baghdad se koi aarthik-vritti nahin mili thi par is main islam ke dharamshastriyon kii dakhal kaa na hona hi ek bada yogadan tha
 At this time, of course, it was difficult to place the entire Islamic empire, which had spread from Spain to India, inside a military hero
 isliye baghdad sirf dharmik mukhyalay rahaa or sthaneey shaasha sainik rup se swatantra rahe
 In Eastern Iran, where the Samanis and then the Ghaznavis remained independent, the Saljuq Turks became powerful in the Central and West
 dharmayudhon ke samay bhi baghdad ne koi badi safalataa lene main naakaami dikhaai
 At the same time, the descendants of the Umayyads who were out of power formed a separate Khilafat in Spain in 929 which became the Islamic rival of Baghdad
 1258 main mongolon kii teji se badhati shakti ne baghdad ko haraa diya or shahar ko lut liya gaya
 Millions of people were killed and Islamic libraries were burned
 us samay mongol muslim nahin the lekin agle 100 saalon main ve muslim ban gaye
 The Abbasids held power in Baghdad until the thirteenth century
 par iran or uske aasapaas ke kshetron main abu islam ke prati bahut shraddha bhav tha or abbasiyon ke khilaaf rosh
 According to him, Abu was a true priest of Islam and Ali and Hussain were true officials of Islam
 is vishwaas ko maanane waalon ko shiya kaha gaya
 Ali Shia means the group of Ali
 in logon kii nazar main in logon ne sach kaa rasta apanaaya or inako shaskaon ne bahut sataaya
 Abu Islam also had to embrace the gallows after finding the right caliph for Islam
 uske saath bhi vahi hua jo ali yaa imam hossain ke saath hua
 Therefore, Shia with this view lived in Abbasid rule for many years which were Sunni
 inako samay samay par pratadit bhi kiya gaya
 Later in the fifteenth century, after the coming of Safawi rule, the Shia people were liberated from this persecution
 misr main islam kaa prachaar to ummayadon ke samay hi ho gaya tha
 The Arabs planned for empire expansion in Spain for the first time in 710
 dhire-dhire unke samrajya main spain ke uttari bhaag bhi aa gaye
 By the end of the tenth century it had become part of the Abbasi Khilafat
 isi samay tak sindh bhi arabon ke niyantran main aa gaya tha
 In 1095, Pope Arban II prepared the background of the Crusades
 isaiyon ne spain tathaa purvi kshetron main muslimon kaa muqabla kiya
 Many shrines, including Yeruselam, were redeemed from the dominion of the Muslims

 The Mahmud of Ghazni was becoming powerful in the area of modern-day Afghanistan
