 Homi Jahangir Bhabha was a prominent scientist and dreamer of India who envisioned India's nuclear power program
 unhone mutthi bhar vaigyanikon kii sahaayta se march 1944 main nabhikeey urja par anusandhan armbh kiya
 He started working in nuclear science when the knowledge of unconnected chain reactions was negligible and no one was willing to accept the idea of power generation from nuclear power
 unhen 'architect of indian atomic energy program' bhi kaha jaataa he
 Bhabha was born into an elite Parsi family in Mumbai
 unki kirti saare sansar main faili
 On his return to India he continued his research
 bharat ko parmaanu shakti banane ke mishan main pratham pag ke taur par unhone 1945 main moolbhoot vigyaan main utkrushtataa ke centre tata institute of fundamental research kii sthapana kii

 The father of the Indian Atomic Energy Program died on 24 January 1966 in a plane crash
 unhone mumbai se cathedral or jon kenon skool se padhai kii
 Then passed bsc from Elphinstone College Mumbai and Royale Institute of Science
 mumbai se padhai puri karne ke baad bhabha varsh 1927 main england ke kshas college, cambridge ejineering kii padhai karne gaye
 He graduated from Cambridge University in 1930
 san 1934 main cambridge vishvavidhyalay se unhone doctorat kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 In Germany, he conducted studies and experiments on cosmic rays
 haalanki ejineering padhane kaa nirnay unka nahin tha
 It was the desire of the family to become a promising engineer
 homi ne sabaki baton kaa dhyaan rakhte hue, ejineering kii padhai jarur kii, lekin apane priy vishay physics se bhi khud ko jode rakhaa
 His passion for nuclear physics was up to obsessive levels
 unhone cambridge se hi pita ko patr likh kar apane iraade bataa die the ki physics hi unka antim lakshya he
 When the country became independent, Homi Jahangir Bhabha appealed to Indian scientists working across the world to return to India
 unki apil kaa asar hua or kuch vaigyanik bharat laute bhi
 One of them was Homi Nausherwanji Sethna, who worked at the Imperial Chemical Company of Manchester
 america kii michigan uniwarsity se post grajuation karne vaale sethna main bhabha ko kaaphi sambhaavnaaen dikhaai deen
 Both these scientists got involved in their program to make India a nuclear power
 yah kaarykram mul rup se dow bhabha kii hi dein tha, lekin yah sethna hi the, jinaki vajah se dow bhabha ke nidhan ke baavjood na to yah kaarykram rukaa or na hi isamen koi baadha ai
 The result of his passion was that in 1974 Sethna told the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi that he had completed preparations for a peaceful nuclear explosion
 yah bhi poocha ki kya ve is system ko shuru kar sakate hai? iske saath hi unhone yah bhi bataa diya ki ek baar system shuru hone ke baad ise rokna sambhav nahin hoga, aise main agar ve manaa kar dengi to use nahin suna ja sakegaa kyonki tab visphot hokar hi rahegaa
 Preparations started as soon as Indira Gandhi got the green signal
 agle hi din, 18 may ko sethna ne code verde main indira gandhi ko sandesh bheja- buddha muskaraae
 This nuclear explosion of India was so secret
 dow homi bhabha ne dow sethna ko bharat lautne ke baad bahut soch-samaj kar kerala ke alwaaye sthit indian rer arths limited kaa pramukh banaaya tha, jahaan unhane monozite ret se durlabh nabhikeey padaartho ke ansh nikaale
 During that time he was also the project manager of the canada-india reactor
 iske baad dow sethna ne 1959 main trambe sthit parmaanu urja pratishthan main pramukh vaigyanik adhikari pad kaa kaarybhaar sambhala
 This establishment later became the Bhabha Atomic Research Center
 vahaan unhane nabhikeey grad kaa uranium taiyaar karne ke liye thorium sanyantr kaa nirmaan karaayaa
 His tireless efforts and skillful leadership enabled the construction of the first plant to isolate plutonium at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in 1959
 iske dizin or nirmaan kaa puraa kaam bhartiya vaigyanikon or ejiniyaron ne hi kiya
 It is noteworthy that later on, a nuclear device was prepared from plutonium isolated in the same plant, which exploded in Buddha Pokhran on May 18, 1974
 dow sethna ke maargdarshan main hi 1967 main jaadooguda se uranium hasil karne kaa sanyantr laga
 Dr
 Sethna also developed alloy-oxide fuel as an alternative to uranium fuel for nuclear reactors at Tarapur
 pokharan main parmaanu visphot ke baad america ne uranium kii aapurti par roak laga di thi, haalanki ye riactor america nirmit hi the
 May it be well of France that he helped us by giving uranium at a time, otherwise Dr
 Sethna had prepared to run the nuclear reactor of Tarapur with alloy-oxide
 dow sethna swaavlamban main vishwaas rakhte the or kisi bhi kaam ko puraa karne ke liye kisi ke ahsaan kii jarurat mahasoos nahin karte the
 He did not like political interference in scientific work
 ve parmaanu urja ke shantipurna istemaal ke prabal himachati the
 He was the Deputy Secretary of the International Conference on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy organized by the United Nations in Geneva in 1958
 ve sanyukt raashtra kii vaigyanik salaahkaar samiti ke sadsy the or 1966 se 1981 tak antarrashtriya parmaanu urja agency kii vaigyanik salaahkaar samiti ke bhi sadsy rahe

 Sethna was also the President and Director of many institutions
 ve 1966 main bhabha parmaanu anusandhan centre ke nideshak niyukt hue or 1972 se 1983 tak parmaanu urja ayog ke adhyaksh rahe
 He remained the longest after Homi Bhabha in this position
 is dauraan unhane bhartiya parmaanu urja kaarykram ko nai gati pradaan kii
 He was awarded with many big decorations like Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and Padmavibhushan
 aaj agar bharat ko ek parmaanu shakti ke rup main duniya bhar main manyata mili he, to isamen dow bhabha ke baad sabase zyada yogadan dow sethna kaa hi he
 The Atomic Energy Commission was established in India under the leadership of Dr
 Bhabha
 unke atomic energy ke vikaas ke liye samarpit prayaason kaa hi parinaam tha ki bharat ne varsh 1956 main trambe main asia kaa pehle atomic riector kii sthapana kii gai
 Not only this, Dr

 banke bihari mandir bharat main mathura jile ke vrundavan dham main raman reti par sthit he
 It is one of the ancient and famous temples of India
 banke bihari krishna kaa hi ek rup he jo isamen pradarshit kiya gaya he
 It was built by Swami Haridas in 1864
 shridham vrindavan, yah ek aisi paavan bhoomi he, jis bhoomi par aane maatr se hi sabhi paapon kaa naash ho jaataa he
 After all, who will be the person who does not want to come to this holy land and will not want to show himself to Shri Bankebihari Ji
 yah mandir shri vrindavan dham ke ek sundar ilaake main sthit he
 It is said that this temple was built around the year 1921 with the collective efforts of the descendants of Swami Shri Haridas ji
 mandir nirmaan ke shuruuaat main kisi daan-daata kaa dhan isamen nahin lagaaya gaya
 Shriharidas Swami was a nostalgic Vaishnava subject
 unke bhajan–kirthan se prasann ho nidhivan se shri bankebihariji prakat huye the
 Swami Haridas ji was born in the village of Rajapur near Vrindavan on the eighth day of the bright fortnight of Bhadrapada month in Samvat 1536
 inke aradhyadev shyaam–saloni surat baale shribankebihari ji the
 His father's name was Gangadhar and mother's name was Mrs
 Chitra Devi
 haridas ji, swami aashudhir dev ji ke shishy the
 On seeing this, Ashudhir Devji knew that he is the incarnation of Sakhi Lalitaji and on the day of Radhaashtami, the devotion of Bhakti Pradhani Shri Radha ji's festival of Mangal Mahotsav is here for the benefit
 haridasji ko rasanidhi sakhi kaa avatar mana gaya he
 He used to be bored with the world since childhood
 kishoravastha main inhone aashudhir ji se yugal mantra diksha lee tathaa yamuna sameep nikunj main ekaant sthaan par jaakar dhyaan-magn rahane lage
 When he was 25 years old, he received illusions from his Guru and away from the world, was left to contemplate Nikunj Bihari's daily pastimes
 nikunj van main hi swami haridasji ko bihariji kii murti nikaalane kaa swapnadesh hua tha
 Then according to his ignorance, Shree Vigraha, having the image of Manohar Shyamvarna, was taken out of the lap
 yahi sundar murti jag main shribankebihari ji ke naam se vikhyath hui yah murti margshirsh, shukla ke panchami tithi ko nikaala gaya tha
 Therefore, we treat Prakatya Tithi as Vihara Panchami with great enthusiasm
 yugal kishor sarkaar kii murti radha krishna kii sanyukt chhavi yaa aikikrut chhavi ke kaaran banke bihari ji ke chhavi ke madhya ack alokik prakaash kii anubhuti hoti he,jo banke bihari ji main radha tatv kaa parichaayak he
 Swami Haridas shri bankebihari ji nidhivan main hi bahut samay tak swami ji dwaara sevit hote rahe the
 Then when the construction of the temple was completed, then they were brought there and installed
 sanay vansh paramparaagat shrikrishna yeti ji, bihari ji ke bhoga evam anya seva vyavastha sambhaale rahe
 Then he appointed Hargulal Seth ji in Samvat 1975 to take care of the service system of Sribihari ji
 tab is seth ne veri, kolkata, rohtak, ityadi sthanon par shribankebihari treston kii sthapana kii
 Apart from this, the cooperation of other devotees is also helping in this
 anand kaa vishay he ki jab kaala pahaad ke utpaat kii ashanka se anekon vigrah sthaanantarit hue
 But Sribankevihari did not transfer from here
 aaj bhi unki yahaan prem sahit puja chal rahi hai
 Later, by changing Swami Haridas ji's worship system, a new sect, independent of the Nimbarka sect, became a Sakhibhava sect
 isi paddati anusaar vrindavan ke sabhi mandiron main seva evam mahotsav aadi manaaye jate hai
 Shri Sreebakebihari ji is ordained in the temple of Shri Sreebakebihari only on the day of Sharad Purnima
 keval shraavan teej ke din hi thakur ji jhule par baithte hai evam janmashtami ke din hi keval unki mangala–aarti hoti hai
 Whose fortunes are received only by a fortunate person
 or charan darshan keval akshay tritiya ke din hi hota he
 The raft of those who see these stage-lotuses is overcome
 swami haridas ji sangeet ke prasiddh gayak evam tansen ke guru the
 One morning Swamiji started seeing that someone was sleeping on his bed with a quilt
 yah dekhakar swami ji bole– are mere bistar par koun so rahaa hai
 Sreebihari ji himself was sleeping there
 shabd sunate hi bihari ji nikal bhaage
 But they left their chudas and wanshi on the bed
 swami ji, vruddh avasthaa main drushti jeern hone ke kaaran unakon kuch najar nahin aay
 After this, when the priest of Shri Bankebihariji temple opened the doors of the temple, when the priest of Shri Bankevihariji temple opened the doors of the temple, he could not see the sarcasm and wiggle in the face of shribankebihari Ji
 kintu mandir kaa darwaja band tha
 Surprised, the priest came to Swamiji at Nidhivan and told Swamiji all the things
 swami ji bole ki praatavkaal koi mere panlag par soya hua tha
 He has left something while leaving
 tab pujari ji ne pratyaksh dekha ki panlag par shribankebihari ji kii chuda–vanshi virajman hai
 This proves that Sribankebihari ji goes to Nidivan to do raas at night
 isi kaaran se praatah shribihari ji kii mangala–aarti nahin hoti hai
 Reason- Bihari ji comes here after night
 atah praatah shayan main baadha daalkar unki aarti karnaa aparaadh hai
 Many emperors used to come here to get the darshan of Swami Haridas ji
 ek baar dilli ke samraat akbar, swami ji ke darshan hetu yahan aaye the
 The darshan of Thakur ji is from 9 am to 12 noon and from 6 pm to 9 pm
 vishesh tithi uplakshyanusaar samay ke parivartan kar diya jaataa hai
 There are many stories in relation to the philosophy of Sribakebihari Ji
 jinamein se ek tathaa do nimnlikhit hai– ek baar ek bhaktimati ne apane pati ko bahut anunay–vinay ke pashchaat vrindavan jane ke liye raji kiya
 Both came to Vrindavan to see Sribakebihari ji
 kuch din shribihari ji ke darshan karne ke pashchaat uske pati ne jab swagrih waapas lautne ki cheshtaa kii to bhaktimati ne shribihari ji darshan laabh se vanchit hona padegaa, aisa sochakar wo rone lagi
 The world will go to heaven for bondage, so she starts crying near Sribihari ji, "O Lord, i am going home, but you stay with me forever, after praying, both of them will go towards the railway station
" Sitting in a horse cart walked
 us samay shribankevihari ji ek gop balak kaa rup dhaaran kar ghodagadee ke peeche aakar unako saath lekar le jane ke liye bhaktimati se prarthana karne lage
 Here, the priest not knowing Thakur ji in the temple, he came to know about the love incident of Bhaktimati and immediately he ran behind the horse cart
 gaadi main balak rupi shribankebihari ji se prarthana karne lage
 While having such a conversation between the two, that child disappeared from their midst
 tab pujari ji mandir lautakar pun shribankebihari ji ke darshan karne lage
 Here, both the devotee and Bhaktimati, knowing the kindness of Sribakebihari himself, both gave up their movement of the world and dedicated their lives at the feet of Sribakebihari
 aise hi anekon kaaran se shribankebihari ji ke jhalak darshan arthath jhaanki darshan hote hai
 There is a curtain on the front door of the temple Shri Sibihari and that curtain is closed and opened at an interval of two minutes and there is another legend
 ek baar ek bhakt dekhtaa rahaa ki uski bhakthi ke vasheebhoot hokar shribankebihari ji bhaag gayi
 When the priest opened the doors of the temple, he did not see shribankebihari
 pataa chalaa ki ve apane ek bhakt kii gavaahi dene aligarh chale gayi hai
 Since then it has been made such a rule that the curtain of Thakur ji will be opened and closed in Jhalak Darshan
 aisi hi bahut sari kahaniyaan prachlit he
 Sribakebihari Ji appeared from Swami Haridasji from Visakha Kund located in Nidivan
 is mandir main krishna ke saath shriradhika vigrah kii sthapana nahin hui
 On the Akshaya Tritiya of Vaishakh month, Sree Charanchas of Sribakebihari are seen
 pehle ye nidhivan main hi virajman the
 Later visited the present temple
 yawanon ke updrav ke samay shribankebihari ji gupt rup se vrindavan main hi rahe, baahar nahin gayi
 Sribakebihari ji has a special tableau philosophy
 yahan jhaanki darshan kaa kaaran unka bhaktavatsalya evam rasikata he
 At one time a devout nobleman appeared for his darshan
 ve bahut der tak ek-tak se inhen nihaarte rahe
 Rasik Bankebihari ji looked at them and went with them to his village
 baad main bihari ji ke goswamiyon ko pataa lagane par unka peechha kiya or bahut anunay-vinay kar thakurji ko lautaa-kar shrimandir main padhraya
 Therefore, a tableau philosophy of Bihari ji was arranged so that no one could fight his eyes
 yahan ek vilakshan baat yah he ki yahan mangal aarti nahin hoti
 The Gosaias here say that Thakurji sleeps at night in the morning, tired at night
 us samay inhen jagaanaa uchit nahin he
 The faith of the people is so much that one of the devotees who came to see the last Ashwin Shukla Panchami, who could not see anything with eyes, just inquired Baba that you are unable to see, yet have come to see Bihari ji
 unhone uttar diya lala mujhe nahin dikhataa he,par bihari ji mujhe dekh rahe hai

 This is an article related to Sangam literature of Tamil language
 sangam ke anya arthon ke liye yahaan jaaen - sangam Sangam literature is literature written in Tamil language from the fifth century BCE to the middle of the second century
 isaki rachana or sangrahan pandya shaskaon dwaara madurai main yojit teen sangam ke dauraan hui

 Their meetings were called 'sangam' and the literature composed in these meetings was called 'sangam literature'
 isamen tiruvalluvar jaise tamil santon kii kritiyaan ‘kural’ ullekhneey hai jinka baad main anek bhashaaon main anuwaad kiya gaya
 Sangam literature is a collection of many small and big poems composed in praise of many heroes and heroes
 ye kavitaayen dharmasambandhi nahin he tathaa ye ucchkoti kii rachanaayen hai
 Three such Sangam meetings were held
 pratham sangam main sankalit kavitaayen gum ho gayi
 2000 poems of the second part have been compiled
 sangam sahitya main 30,000 panktiyon kii kavitaayen shaamil hai
 These were compiled into eight collections, called 'ettutokoi'
 inke do mukhya samooh hai- paatinenkil conaku or pattupattu 
 The first group is generally considered older and relatively more historical than the second
 tiruvalluvar kii kriti 'kural' ko teen bhaagon main baanta gaya he
 The first part is epic, the second part is about politics and governance and the third part is about love
 sangam sahitya ke alaava ek rachana ‘tolkkapium’ bhi he

 Goswami Tulsidas was a great poet of Hindi literature
 inkaa janm soron shukarakshetra, vartmaan main kasganj uttar pradesh main hua tha
 Some scholars believe you were born in Rajapur district Banda
 inhen aadi kavy ramayana ke rachayita maharishi valmiki kaa avatar bhi mana jaataa he
 The story of Sriramcharitmanas is taken from Ramayana
 ramcharitamanas lok granth he or ise uttar bharat main bade bhakthibhaav se padhaa jaataa he
 After this, Vinaya Patrika is another important poem of his
 mahakavy shriramcharitamanas ko vishwa ke 100 sarvshereshth lokapriy kaavyon main 46vaan sthaan diya gaya
 Most scholars are in favor of considering Rajapur, the birth place of Tulsidas
 yadhyapi kuch ise soron shukarakshetra bhi maanate hai
 Rajapur is a village located in the Chitrakoot district of Uttar Pradesh
 vahaan atmaram dube naam ke ek pratishthit sarauparin brahman rahete the
 His wife's name was Hulasi
 sanwat 1511 ke shravan maas ke shuklapaksh kii saptami tithi ke din abhukt mul nakshatra main inhen dampati ke yahan tulsidas kaa janm hua
 According to popular folklore, the baby was extremely strong due to being in the mother's womb for twelve months and the teeth were visible in her mouth
 janm lene ke saath hi usne ram naam kaa uccharan kiya jisase uskaa naam rambola pad gaya
 Mother died on the second day of her birth
 pita ne kisi or anisht se bachane ke liye balak ko chuniyaan naam kii ek daasi ko saunp diya or swayan virakt ho gayi
 When Rambola was five and a half years old, Chuniya was also no more
 vah gali-gali bhatakta hua anathon kii tarah jivan jeene ko vivash ho gaya
 With the inspiration of Lord Shankarji, Shri Ananthanandji, a dear disciple of Shri Anantanand Ji, who lived on Ramshail, found this child who had become famous by the name of this Rambola and duly named it Tulsiram
 taduparant ve use ayodhya le gayi or vahaan sanwat 1561 magh shukla panchami ko uskaa yagyopavit-sanskaar sampann karaayaa
 At the time of the rites, even without being taught, the child Rambola pronounced Gayatri-mantra, which surprised everyone
 iske baad narhari baba ne vaishnavon ke paanch sanskaar karke balak ko ram-mantra kii diksha di or ayodhya main hi rahakar use vidyadhyayan karaayaa
 The wisdom of the child Rambola was very sharp
 vah ek hi baar main guru-mukh se jo sun letaa, use vah kanthsth ho jaataa
 From there, after some time, both the teacher and the disciple reached the sugar field
 vahaan narhari baba ne balak ko ram-katha sunaayi kintu vah use bhalee-bhanti samaj na aayi
 Jyeshtha Shukla Trayodashi, on Thursday, 1583, at the age of 29, was married to Kanya Ratnavali of the very beautiful Bharadwaja gotra, a village on the far side of the Yamuna, a little away from Rajapur
 chunki gauna nahin hua tha at: kuch samay ke liye ve kaashi chale gayi or vahaan sheshasnathan ji ke paas rahakar veda-vedang ke adhyayan main jute gayi
 While living there, suddenly one day he remembered his wife and started getting distraught
 jab nahin rahaa gaya to guruuji se ajna lekar ve apni janmabhumi rajapur laut aaye
 Since his wife Ratnavali was in the maternal house as he had not become a cowherd by then, Tulsiram swam across the sweltering Yamuna river in the dark dark night and went straight to his wife's bedroom
 ratnavali itani raat gayi apane pati ko akele aayaa dekh kar aashcharyachakit ho gayi
 When he asked them to return quietly in fear of public shame, they started urging him to go home at the same time
 unki is apratyaashit jid se khijhakar ratnavali ne swarchit ek dohe ke madhyam se jo shiksha unhen di usne hi tulsiram ko tulsidas bana diya
 The Doha that Ratnavali said was as follows: yah doha sunate hi unhone usee samay patni ko vahiin uske pita ke ghar chhod diya or waapas apane gaanv rajapur laut gayi
 On going to his house in Rajapur, when he came to know that his father was not there in his absence and the whole house was destroyed, he suffered even more
 unhone vidhi-vidhaan purvak apane pita ji kaa shraadh kiya or gaanv main hi rahakar logon ko bhagwaan ram kii katha sunaane lage
 After staying in Rajapur for some time, he again went to Kashi and started telling Ram Katha to the people there
 katha ke dauraan unhen ek din manushya ke vesh main ek pret mila, jisane unhen hanuman ji kaa pataa batalaaya
 Tulsidas, meeting Hanumanji, requested him to have darshan of Shri Raghunathji
 hanumanji ne kaha- "tumhen chitrakoot main raghunathji darshan hongen
 "on this Tulsidas ji started towards Chitrakoot
 chitrakoot pahunch kar unhone ramghat par apana asana jamaaya
 One day he went for circumambulation when suddenly in his way he saw Shri Ram
 unhone dekha ki do bade hi sundar rajkumaar ghodon par savaar hokar dhanush-baan liye ja rahe hai
 Tulsidas was attracted to see them, but could not recognize them
 tabhi peeche se hanumanji ne aakar jab unhen sara bhed bataaya to ve pashchaatap karne lage
 On this, Hanumanji consoled him and said that he would be seen again in the morning
 sanwat 1607 kii mauni amavasya ko buudhvaar ke din unke saamne bhagwaan shriram punah prakat hue
 He came as a child and said to Tulsidas - "baba! We want sandalwood, can you give us sandalwood?" Hanumanji thought, "may he not be deceived this time too, so he took the form of a parrot and said this couplet:" tulsidas shriram ji kii us adbhut chhavi ko nihaar kar apane sharir kii sud-budh hi bhul gayi
 Ultimately, God himself took the sandal from his hand and applied it on his and Tulsidas Ji's forehead and disappeared
 sanwat 1628 main vah hanuman ji kii ajna lekar ayodhya kii ore chal pade
 In those days, there was a Magh Mela in Prayag
 ve vahaan kuch din ke liye thahar gayi
 Six days after the festival, he saw Bharadwaja and Yajnavalkya Muni under a vatavriksha
 vahaan us samay vahi katha ho rahi thi, jo unhone sukarakshetra main apane guru se suni thi
 At the end of the Magh Mela, Tulsidas came back to Kashi from Prayag and resided at the house of a Brahmin at Prahladghat
 vahiin rahete hue unke andar kavitv-shakti kaa prasphuran hua or ve sanskrit main padya-rachana karne lage
 But all the verses he composed in the day, all of them would disappear in the night
 yah ghatana roj ghatati
 Tulsidas ji had a dream on the eighth day
 bhagwaan shankar ne unhen aadesh diya ki tum apni bhashaa main kavy rachana karo
 Tulsidas ji got sleepy
 ve uthakar baith gayi
 At the same time Lord Shiva and Parvati appeared to him
 tulsidas ji ne unhen sashtaang pranaam kiya
 Pleased on this, Shiva said - "you go to Ayodhya and write poetry in Hindi
 mere aashirwad se tumhaari kavita samaveda ke samaan falvati hogi
 "gaurishankar got into trouble after saying so
 tulsidas ji unki ajna shirodharya kar kaashi se sidhe ayodhya chale gayi
 The year 1631 started
 daivayog se us varsh ramanavami ke din vaisaa hi yoga aayaa jaisaa tretayug main ram-janm ke din tha
 That morning Tulsidas ji started the creation of Shri Ramcharitmanas
 do varsh, saat maheene or chhbbees din main yah adbhut granth sampann hua
 On the day of Rama's marriage in Margashirsha Shuklapaksa, in the year 1633, the seven scams were completed
 iske baad bhagwaan kii ajna se tulsidas ji kaashi chale aaye
 There he narrated Sri Ramacharitmanas to Lord Vishwanath and Mother Annapurna
 raat ko pustak vishwanath-mandir main rakh di gayi
 When the doors of the temple were opened in the morning, it was found written on the book - Satya Shivam Sundaram under which Lord Shankar was right
 us samay vahaan upasthit logon ne "satyam shivan sundaram" kii aawaaj bhi kaanon se suni
 Here, when the Pandits of Kashi came to know about this, their heart enraged
 ve dal banaakar tulsidas ji kii ninda or us pustak ko nasht karne kaa praytn karne lage
 He also sent two thieves to steal the book
 choron ne jaakar dekha ki tulsidas ji kii kuti ke aasapaas do yuvak dhanushbaan liye paharaa de rahe hai
 Both the youngsters were very beautiful, Shyam and Gaur Varna respectively
 unke darshan karte hi choron kii buddhi shuddh ho gayi
 He stopped stealing from that time and started worshiping the Lord
 tulsidas ji ne apane liye bhagavan ko ksht hua jaan kuti kaa sara samaan lutaa diya or pustak apane mitra todermal ke yahan rakhwa di
 He then wrote another copy with his unique memory
 usee ke aadhaar par duusari pratilipiyaan taiyaar kii gayin or pustak kaa prachaar dinon-din badhane laga
 Here the Pandits of Kashi, seeing no other remedy, prayed to the Mahapandit named Shri Madhusudan Saraswati to give his consent after seeing that book
 madhusudan saraswati ji ne use dekhakar badi prasannataa prakat kii or us par apni ore se yah tippanee likh di- Its meaning in Hindi is as follows - "tulsidas is a walking and moving plant of Tulsi in the joy-forest of Kashi
 uski kavy-manjari badi hi manohar he, jis par shriram rupi bhanvaraa sadaa mandraata rahata he
 " panditon ko unki is tippanee par bhi santosh nahin hua
 Then another way of examining the book was thought of
 kaashi ke vishwanath-mandir main bhagavan vishwanath ke saamne sabase upar veda, unke neeche shaastra, shastron ke neeche puraana or sabake neeche ramcharitamanas rakh diya gaya
 When the temple was opened in the morning, people saw that Sri Ramacharitmanas was placed on the Vedas
 ab to sabhi pandit bade lajjit hue
 He apologized to Tulsidas ji and took his footsteps with devotion
 tulsidas ji jab kaashi ke vikhyat ghat asighat par rahane lage to ek raat kaliyug moort rup dhaaran kar unke paas aayaa or unhen pidaa pahunchaane laga
 Tulsidas ji meditated on Hanuman ji at the same time
 hanuman ji ne saakshaat prakat hokar unhen prarthana ke pad rachane ko kaha, iske pashchaat unhone apni antim kriti vinay-patrika likhi or use bhagwaan ke charnon main samarpit kar diya
 Shri Ram ji himself signed it and made Tulsidas ji fearless
 sanwat 1680 main shravan krishna tritiya shanivaar ko tulsidas ji ne "ram-ram" kehete hue apana sharir parityag kiya
 Tulsidas ji's handwriting was highly beautiful as it was the art of calography in that era
 unke janm-sthaan rajapur ke ek mandir main shriramcharitamanas ke ayodhyakand kii ek prati surakshit rakhi hui he
 The following two verses were also published by Indraprastha Bharati, a magazine of Hindi Academy Delhi, outlining the personality and gratitude of Tulsi in the manuscript of Madanlal Varma 'krant', a poet with the same copy
 inamen pehla chand simhavlokan he jisaki visheshta yah he ki prayek charan jis shabd se samaapt hota he usase aage kaa usee se praranbh hota he
 The first and last words also remain the same
 kavyashastra main ise adbhut chand kaha gaya he
 The same verses were also published in the Tulsi Jayanti special issue of Sahityaprikaprama, another magazine
 apane 126 varsh ke deergh jivan-kaal main tulsidas ne kalkrmanusaar nimnlikhit kaaljayi granthon kii rachanaayen kin - Of these, the praise of a poet seems to be accurate in the works of Ramcharitmanas, Vinaya Patrika, Kavitavali, Geetavali - Pasya Devasya Poetry, Neither Mrnoti nor Jeerati
 arthath devpurushon kaa kavy dekhiye jo na marataa na purana hota he
 About four hundred years ago Tulsidas ji composed his creations
 aadhunik prakaashan-suvidhaon se rahit us kaal main bhi tulsidas kaa kavy jan-jan tak pahunch chukaa tha
 This is a direct proof of his popularization as a poet
 maanas jaise vrihad granth ko kanthsth karke saamaanya padhe likhe log bhi apni shuchita evam gyaan ke liye prasiddh hone lage the
 Ramcharitmanas has been the most popular text of Tulsidas ji
 unhone apni rachanaaon ke sambandh main kahin koi ullekh nahin kiya he, isliye pramanik rachanaaon ke sambandh main ant:sakshya kaa abhaav dikhaayi detaa he
 The books published by Nagari Pracharini Sabha Kashi are as follows: 'encychlopedia of religen and athiks' main grearsan ne bhi uparokt pratham baarah granthon kaa ullekh kiya he
 This is a rite of passage
 is geet main katipay ullekh ram-vivaah kii katha se bhinn hai
 Vairagya Sandipani is considered unnatural by Mata Prasad Gupta, but Acharya Chandrawali Pandey considers it authentic and an early creation of Tulsi
 kuch or pracheen pratiyon ke uplabdh hone se thos pramaan mil sakate hai
 The first Sorta of Saint Mahima's description is - vidwaanon ne ise tulsi kii rachana ghoshit kiya he
 In terms of style, it is an authentic creation of Tulsidas
 isaki khandit prati hi granthawali main sampadit he
 It appears to be an authentic creation of Tulsi
 isaki kaavyatmak praudhata tulsi siddhant ke anukool he
 The poem is simple, comprehensively interesting and succulent
 ""jagat maatu pitu sambhu bhavani"" kii shringaarik cheshtaaon kaa tanik bhi put nahin he
 The folk tradition is so status quo that it is less influenced by Sanskrit poetry of Sanskrit, and Tulsi's narrative narrative on the devotional role of Mati
 vyavhaaron kii sushthuta, prem kii ananyta or vaivaahik kaarykram kii sarasata ko badi saavdhaanee se kavi ne ankit kiya he
 Tulsidas was very satisfied with his creation, that is why this unhappy devotee has praised his mother only once - vidwaanon ne ise tulsidas kii pramanik rachanaaon main sthaan diya he
 But it also has intercept
 tulsi ke maanas ke purv valmikiy ramayana kii katha hi lok prachlit thi
 Tulsidas's differences with the pandits of Kashi about Tulsidas and Vishwanath's signature on the copy of Manas are famous
 yah jyotish shastreey paddati kaa granth he
 Divided into couplets, saptakas and cantos, this book is a mixed composition of various Mars and amalgamous episodes of Ramakatha
 kavy kii drushti se is granth kaa mahatva naganya he
 All consider it to be tulsified
 isamen katha-shrinkhalaa kaa abhaav he or valmikiy ramayana ke prasangon kaa anuwaad anek dohon main he
 Most of the couplets in Dohavali are of Manas
 kavi ne chatak ke vyaaj se dohon kii ek lambii shrinkhalaa likhakar bhakthi or prem kii vyakhya kii he
 Dohavali is a Doha collection
 maanas ke bhi kuch katha nirpeksh dohon ko isamen sthaan he
 It is possible that some couplets will also be projected in it, but the opaqueness of the composition is unquestionable
 kavitawali tulsidas kii rachana he, par sabha sanskaran athwa anya sanskarnon main prakashit yah rachana puri nahin prathit hoti he

 priyanka gandhi wadra yaa priyanka gandhi vadera ek bhartiya rajanitijna hai
 She is from the gandhi-nehru family and is the granddaughter of Feroze Gandhi and Indira Gandhi
 priyanka wadra bharat ke purv pradhanmantri rajeev gandhi or bhartiya rashtriya congress kii purv adhyaksha evam sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan kii mukhiya sonia gandhi kii duusari santan he
 His grandmother Indira Gandhi and Nana Jawaharlal Nehru have also been Prime Ministers of India
 unke dada firoz gandhi ek jane-maane sansad sadsy the or unke parnana, motilal nehru bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke ek mahatvapurn netaa the
 He received his education from the Modern School, Convent of Jesus and Mary, New Delhi and is a graduate of Psychology from the University of Delhi
 vah ek shaukia radio sanchaalak he, jinke paas VU2PGY kaalsin he
 Priyanka Gandhi's role is seen as a contradiction in politics, although during the continuous election campaigning for the Congress party in Uttar Pradesh, she spoke of taking less interest in politics
 1999 ke chunaav abhiyaan ke dauraan, bibisi ke liye ek saakshaatkaar main unhone kaha: mere dimag main yah baat bilkul spasht he ki raajnneeti shaktishaalee nahin he, balki janata adhik mahatvapurn he or main unki seva raajnneeti se baahar rahakar bhi kar sakati hoon
 However, the question of his going into formal politics seems troublesome: "I have repeated this thing thousands of times, that i am not willing to go into politics 


"
 haalanki, unhone apni maan or bhai ke nirvachan kshetron raibareli or amethi main niyamit rup se daura kiya or jahaan unhone logon se sidhaa samvaad hi sthapit nahin kiya varan iskaa anand bhi liya
 He is a popular personality in the constituency, he is also successful in attracting huge masses all around him; a popular slogan in Amethi at the time of each election is Amethi ka Danka, Bitiya Priyanka
 inaki gananaa achche, sulajhi or safal aayojko main kii jaati he or unhen apni maan kii "mukhya raajnneetik salaahkaar" mana jaataa he
 In the 2004 Indian general election, she was her mother's election campaign manager and helped in the election management of her brother Rahul Gandhi
 ek press vaarta main inhi chunaavon ke dauraan unhone kaha ki "raajnneeti kaa matlab janata kii seva karnaa he or main vah pehle se hi kar rahi hoon
 i can continue this for five more years
 " is baat se yah atakalein tej ho gai ki vah uttar pradesh main congress party ke liye koi jimmedaari vahan kar sakati hai
 In an interview with BBC Hindi radio service, he mentioned the war in Sri Lanka and remarked "you are not only responsible for your becoming a terrorist, but your method is responsible which makes you a terrorist
" " In the 2007 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, where Rahul Gandhi managed the statewide campaign, she was focusing on ten seats in the Amethi Rae Bareli region, spending two weeks there, she was inundated with the allocation of middle seats among party workers
 Tried to resolve discord
 kul milakar, congress party rajya main haasiye par chali gai, use 402 main se maatr 22 siton par hi jeet hasil hui, jo kii in dashakon main nunatam he
 But, it is widely known that Priyanka Gandhi's inter-organizational qualities and ability to draw votes, the Congress which won only two seats in the 2002 Assembly, grabbed seven seats, all these seats gained significant gains
 , Which became possible despite party infighting among activists
 raibareli or amethi kshetra ke prayek paanch siton kaa byora is prakaar he: Note that from Rae Bareli, the former Congress candidate, who had won from the Congress since 1993, dissatisfied with the Congress and won as an Independent
 haalaanki is kshetra ke anya sabhi chunaav kshetron main congress ko mahatvapurn badhat hasil hui
 He is married to Robert Vadra, whom he probably met at the home of his family friend Ottavio Quattrocchi
 unke rehaan or miraya naamak do bachche hai
 On February 6, 2007, when Bofors scam-tainted businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi was arrested in Argentina and failed to bring the Indian government team to extradite him to India, the Indian Express accused Ottavio's son Massimo Quattrocchi that Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka They had grown up with Gandhi for about two decades, probably in a party of 17 February, these people met Be
 parantu is aarope kaa congress mahasachiv digvijay singh dwaara dridhtaa se inkaar kiya gaya tha, jinhone ek saakshaatkaar main kaha: "main yah baat daawey se kah rahaa hoon ki sarkaar ne kwatrochi kii jaanch main kabhi dakhal nahin diya he or jahaan tak rahul gandhi or priyanka gandhi kaa sambandh he, unka is maamle se koi lenaa dena nahin he
 "
 However, speculation continues in this case because of Massimo's stay in India at that time and the CBI surprisingly delaying acceptance of Quattrocchi's arrest

 vishwanath pratap singh 
 Vishwanath Pratap Singh was the eighth Prime Minister of India
 rajeev gandhi sarkaar ke patan ke kaaran pradhanmantri bane vishwanath pratap singh ne aam chunaav ke madhyam se 2 disambar 1989 ko yah pad praapt kiya tha
 Singh as Prime Minister is known for his efforts to reform India's backward castes
 vishwanath pratap singh kaa janm 25 june 1931 uttar pradesh ke elahabaad zile main ek rajput zameendaar parivaar main hua tha
 He was the son of Raja Bahadur Rai Gopal Singh
 unka vivaah 25 june 1955 ko apane janm din par hi sita kumari ke saath sampann hua tha
 He received two sons and jewels
 unhone elahabaad main gopal intermediat college kii sthapana kii thi
 Vishwanath Pratap Singh studied at the Universities of Allahabad and Poona
 vah 1947-1948 main udai pratap college, varanasi kii vidhyaarthee union ke adhyaksh rahe
 Vishwanath Pratap Singh was also the Vice President of the Student Union of Allahabad University
 1957 main unhone bhudaan aandolan main sakriy bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Singh donated his land
 iske liye paariwarik vivaad hua, jo ki nyaayalay bhi ja pahunchaa tha
 He was also a member of the Executive Cell of All India Congress Committee, Allahabad
 vishwanath pratap singh ko apane vidhyaarthee jivan main hi raajnneeti se dilchaspee ho gai thi
 He was from an affluent family, so he got success in youth politics
 unka sambandh bhartiya congress party ke saath ho gaya
 He reached the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly in 1969–1971
 unhone uttar pradesh main mukhyamantri kaa kaarybhaar bhi sambhaala
 His Chief Ministership lasted from 9 June 1980 to 28 June 1982
 iske pashchaatt vah 29 janvari 1983 ko kendriya vaanijya mantri bane
 Vishwanath Pratap Singh was also a member of the Rajya Sabha
 31 disambar 1984 ko vah bharat ke vittamantri bhi bane
 In the Indian political scene, Vishwanath Pratap Singh was the finance minister when he had a confrontation with Rajiv Gandhi
 vishwanath pratap singh ke paas yah soochna thi ki kai bharatiyon dwaara videshi bainkon main akut dhan jamaa karavaaya gaya he
 On this, VP Singh ie Vishwanath Pratap Singh appointed a spy organization of America, Fairfax so that such Indians could be traced
 isi bich sweden ne 16 april 1987 ko yah samachar prasaarit kiya ki bharat ke boforce company kii 410 topon kaa sauda hua tha, usamen 60 karod kii raashi kamishan ke taur par di gai thi
 When this news reached the Indian media, it started presenting it daily by making it headstrong
 is 'braking news' kaa upyog vipaksh ne bhi koob kiya
 He sent a message to the public that in the Rs 60 crore brokerage, Rajiv Gandhi's government was running away from the investigation
 rajeev gandhi ko bhartiya nyaayalay ne clin chit bhi pradaan kar di
 The 1989 elections also came in the limelight for the Bofors scandal
 ve
 pi
 singh or vipaksh ne ise chunavi mudde ke rup main pesh kiya
 Although preliminary investigation has proved that no allegations have been made against Rajiv Gandhi by the Auditor General, the Auditor General had undoubtedly raised the credibility of the cannons
 bhartiya janata ke madhya yah baat spasht ho gai ki bofars topein vishwasaniyan nahin hai to saude main dallali lee gai hogi
 In such a situation, the target was to be made by Rajiv Gandhi and his government
 idhar ve
 pi
 singh ne 1987 main congress dwaara nishkasit kiye jane par vibhishana kii bhoomika nibhaane kaa man bana liya tha
 But this Vibhishan wanted Rama's defeat, not Ravana's
 ve
 pi
 singh ne janata ke madhya jaakar yah dushprachaar karnaa armbh kar diya ki congress sarkaar main sheersh str par bhrashtachar vyaapt he
 This is why bureaucracy and bureaucracy have become corrupt
 ucch str par bhrashtachar ke daawey ne bharat ke sabhi virgon ko chaunkaa diya
 VP Singh's words sounded to him like the true word of Satyavadi Harishchandra
 ve
 pi
 singh ne chunaav kii tithi ghoshit hone ke baad jansabhaon main daawa kiya ki boforce topon kii dallali kii raqam 'lotus' naamak videshi bank main jamaa karai he or vah satta main aane ke baad puure prakaran kaa kulasa kar denge
 The accuser, who was the surveyor of the Ministry of Finance and Defense in the Congress, was making this accusation, due to this the proletariat accepted that there must be truth in the claims of VP Singh
 ab yahan yah kehane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he ki ve
 pi
 singh dwaara rajeev gandhi ke prati dushprachaar kaa uddeshy satta tak pahunchnaa hi tha
 In this election truth and honesty were sacrificed and lies misled people
 yahi manovigyaan bhi he ki yadi koi jhooth baar-baar aapke kaanon main padataa he to ek din aap use sach maane lete hai
 The same thing happened in the case of the Bofors deal
 bhartiya janata ne ise sach maan liya
 Thus, in this election VP Singh's image became that of a politician whose honesty and devotion could not be doubted
 uttar pradesh ke yuvaaon ne to unhen apana nayak maan liya tha
 VP Singh lived side by side with the students
 vah motorcycle par chunaav prachaar karte chaatro ke saath ho lete the
 He also avoided car rides as much as possible to represent himself as an ordinary person
 falswaroop iskaa sarthak prabhaav dekhne ko praapt hua
 On the one hand VP Singh created the image of his truthful Harishchandra among the public and on the other hand he started the work of breaking the Congress
 jo log rajeev gandhi se asantusht the, unase ve
 pi
 singh ne sampark karnaa armbh kar diya
 He wanted the dissident Congress to break away from Rajiv Gandhi and the Congress Party
 unki is muhim main pehla naam tha-aarif mohammad kaa
 Arif Muhammad was a man of free and progressive views
 is kaaran vah chaahate the ki islamic kuritiyon ko samaapt kiya janaa aavashyak he
 Arif Muhammad and Rajiv Gandhi were very close to each other but an incident created a gap between them
 darasal hua yah ki hyderabad main shahbaano ko uske pati dwaara talaaq dene ke baad maamla adaalat tak ja pahunchaa
 The court considered the Muslim woman Shahbano eligible for subsistence allowance
 lekin muslim kattarpanthi chaahate the ki 'muslim personal lau' ke aadhaar par hi faisla kiya jaae
 For this reason, this dispute had caught a lot of momentum
 aisi sthiti main rajeev gandhi ne aarif mohammad se kaha ki vah ek zordaar abhiyaan chalaakar logon ko samajhaayen ki muslimon ko nayaa kaanoon maananaa chahie or 'muslim vyaktigat kaanoon' par nirbhar nahin rahanaa chahie
 VP Singh along with Vidyacharan Shukla, Ramdhan and Satpal Malik and other disgruntled Congressmen formed their own separate front on 2 October 1987
 is morche main bhartiya janata party bhi sammilit ho gai
 The Left parties also announced their support to the front
 is prakaar saat dalon ke morche kaa nirmaan 6 agast 1988 ko hua or 11 oktober 1988 ko rashtriya morcha kaa vidhivat gathan kar liya gaya
 1989 Lok Sabha Elections complete
 congress ko baari kshati uthaani padi
 It got only 197 seats
 vishwanath pratap singh ke rashtriya morche ko 146 siten milin
 The BJP and the Left parties expressed their intention to support the National Front
 tab bhaajapa ke paas 86 saansad the or vamadalon ke paas 52 saansad
 Thus the National Front got the support of 248 members
 ve
 pi
 singh swayan ko pradhanmantri pad kaa ummidavaar bataa rahe the
 He felt that the defeat of Rajiv Gandhi and the Congress was possible only because of him
 lekin chandrasekhar or devilal bhi pradhanmantri pad kii daud main shariq ho gaye
 In such a situation, it was decided that VP Singh would be crowned as Prime Minister and Chaudhary Devi Lal would be made the Deputy Prime Minister
 pradhanmantri banate hi unhone sikhon ke ghaav par maraham rakhane ke liye swarna mandir kii ore daud lagaai
 Personally, Vishwanath Pratap Singh was very clean-hearted and his image as Prime Minister was of a strong and social political visionary
 unhone mandal kamishan kii siforeeshon ko maanakar desh main vanchit samudaayon kii satta main hissedari par mohar laga di
 VP Singh died at the age of 77 on 27 November 2008 at Apollo Hospital in Delhi

 neech or jati baahar logon ke apane-apane aadim devtaa the
 The upper caste people used to see them with hatred
 unhone aise devi-devataaon kii puja ke liye logon ko nirutsahit kiya

 anya sambandhit shabd hai: dhikkaar, quran ko ek anusmarak or chetavanee ke arth main sanderbhit karata he, or hikmah, kabhi-kabhi prakaashan yaa iske hisse kaa zikr karata he

 or "rahasyodghatan" 
 Another word is al-kitab, although it is also used in Arabic for other scriptures, such as the Torah and the Bible
 musahaf shabd kaa prayog aksar vishesh kuranik lipiyon ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he lekin quran main bhi pehle kii kitabon kii pahchaan karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Islamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his first revelation during his prayer in the cave of Hira on the mountains
 iske baad, unhen 23 varshon kii avadhi main puraa koran kaa khulaasa praapt hua
 According to the hadith and Muslim history, after Muhammad came to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his companions to read the Quran and learn and teach the laws, which were told daily
 yah sambandhit he ki kuch kurash jinhen badr kii ladaai main kaidiyon ke rup main le jaaya gaya tha, unhone kuch musalamaanon ko us samay ke saral lekhan ko sikhaye jane ke baad apni aazaadee hasil kar lee
 Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate
 jaisaa ki shuru main kaha gaya tha, quran ko takhton, khaalon, haddiyon, or ke tane ke chaude lakadiyon par darj kiya gaya tha
 Most suras were in use among Muslims as they have been mentioned in many hadiths and histories by both Sunni and Shia sources, relating to Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, as a way of praying and reading
 haalanki, quran 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke samay pustak rup main maujuud nahin tha
 There is an agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write the revelation
 sahih al-bukaari haddees main mohammad ko rahasyodghatan kaa varnan karte hue bataaya, "kabhi-kabhi yah ghanti bajane kii tarah " or aaisha ne bataaya, "maine dekha ki paigambar bahut hi thande din main vahi se prerit ho rahe hai or unke maathe se pasinaa nikal rahaa tha
 As soon as the inspiration of the same was over, his restlessness would go away
 " quran ke anusaar mohammad kaa pehla prakaashan, ek drushti ke saath tha
 The medium of revelation is described as "a powerful one", a person who was "on the topmost horizon when clear to see
 phir vah nikat aa gaya or mohammad se baat karne laga
 "islamic study scholars state in the Welch encyclopedia that they believe that Muhammad's condition and descriptions at these moments can be considered real, as he was severely disturbed after these revelations
 velch ke mutabik, mohammad kii preranaon kii atimanvi utpatti ke liye unke aas-paas ke logon ne in daure ko dekha hoga
 However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a person, a poet, or a magician because his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures in ancient Arabia
 velch atirikt rup se bataata he ki yah anishchit he ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke praarambhik daawey se pehle yaa baad main ye anubhav hue the
 The Quran describes Muhammad as "ummi", which is traditionally interpreted as "uneducated", but its meaning is more complex
 madhyakaalin tippaneekaron jaise al-tabari ne kaha ki is shabd ne do arthon ko prerit kiya: pehla, saamaanya rup se padhane yaa likhane main asamarthta; doosraa, pichhali kitabon yaa granthon kii anubhavheenata yaa agyanta 
 Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as an indication of the reality of his prophecy
 udhaaharan ke liye, fakhruddin al-raji ke anusaar, yadi mohammad ne lekhan or padhai main maharath hasil kii thi to sambhawatah unhen purvajon kii kitabon kaa adhyayan karne kaa andeh hota
 Some scholars, like Watt, prefer the second meaning of "ummi" - they first take it to indicate unfamiliarity with sacred texts
 quran kii antim aayat varsh 10veen hijri main dhu al-hijjah ke islamic maheene ke 18 veen tarikh ko prakat hui thi, jo ek taarikh he jo mote taur par farvari yaa march 632 se mail khaati he 
 This was revealed after the Prophet gave his sermon in Ghadir e Khumm
 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke baad, unke kai saathi jo quran ko kanthst jaanate the, musalimaa dwaara yamama kii ladaai main maare gaye the
 The first Khalifa, Abu Bakr, later decided to gather the book into a book to preserve it
 zayd ebn thabit quran ko ikattha karne vaale pehle vyakti the kyonki vah allaah ke nabi mohammad se padhe gaye aaayaaton or suron ko likhaa karte the
 Thus, the most important of the classical group, Zaid bin Thabit, collected verses and compiled the entire book to give the Qur'an the form of a book
 is tarah quran ek granth ke rup main aagai or uski prati abu bakr ke saath hi rahi
 For this work, Zaid has cropped all the pages which were written on the bone, on the leaves, on the stones and many people had memorized them
 abu bakar ke baad, mohammad kii vidhwaa hafasa bint umr ko lagbhag 650 main is pandulipi ko saunpa gaya tha
 The third Caliph Uthman ibn Afan began to notice slight differences in the pronunciation of the Quran as Islam spread beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa
 paath kii pavitrataa ko sangrakshit karne ke liye, unhone jayad kii adhyakshata main ek samiti kaa aadesh diya taaki abu bakar kii pratilipi kaa upyog kiya ja sake or quran kii ek maanak prati taiyaar kii ja sake
 Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed in written form
 yah paath us model ban gaya jahaan se muslim duniya ke shahari kendron main pratiyaan banaai gayi or prakshepit kii gayi, or anya sanskarnon ko nasht kar diya gaya mana jaataa he
 The current form of Quran recitation is considered by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr
 shiya ke anusaar, ali ebn abi talib ne mohammad kii mrityu ke turant baad quran kaa ek purna sanskaran sankalit kiya
 The sequence of this text was gathered later during Uthman's era that this version was collected in chronological order
 iske baavjood, unhone manakikrut quran ke khilaaf koi aapatti nahin kii or quran ko parisancharan main sweekaar kar liya
 Other individual copies of the Quran may exist, including the codecs of Ibn Mas'ud and Ube ibn Ka'b, none of which exist today
 quran mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan bikhri hui likhit rup main sabase adhik sambhaavna he
 Several sources indicate that a large number of his companions had missed the revelation during Muhammad's lifetime
 praarambhik tippaniyan or islamic aitihaasik strot quran ke shuruaati vikaas kii uparyukt samaj kaa samarthan karte hai
 The Quran in its current form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad as the discovery of variants has not given much importance
 chicago vishvavidhyalay ke professor fred donor ne kaha ki "


 quran ke ek samaan vyanjan paath ko sthapit karne kaa ek bahut hi shuruaati prayaas tha, jo sambhawatah sancharan main sambandhit granthon kaa ek vyapak or adhik vividh samooh tha
 After the creation of this standardized canonical text, the first official texts were suppressed, and all existing manuscripts — despite their many variants — seem to date back to a time after the establishment of this standard consonant text
 " haalanki quran ke paath ke adhikansh sanskaran reeding ko prasaarit karnaa band kar diya gaya he, kuch abhi bhi hai
 There has been no significant text on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text can be based
 aitihaasik rup se, quran kii saamagree par vivaad shaayad hi kabhi ek mudda ban gaya he, haalanki is vishay par bahes jari he
 In 1972, in a mosque in the city of Sana'a, Yemen, manuscripts were discovered that later proved to be the oldest Quranic text existing at the time
 sanaa kii pandulipiyon main ek prishth he jisamen se charmpatr pun: prayojya banane ke liye dhoyaa gaya he- ek abhyaas jo pracheen samay main lekhan saamagree kii kami ke kaaran aam tha
 However, the faint washed-out underlying text is still barely visible and is considered "pre-uthmanic" Quranic content, while the text written at the top is considered Uthmanic time
 radiocarbon dating kaa upyog karne vaale adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki charmpatr 671 sii se pehle kii avadhi ke liye 99 pratishat sambhaavna ke saath dinaankit hai
 In 2015, very early Quran fragments dating back 1370 years were discovered in the library of the University of Birmingham, England
 oxford uniwarsity radiocarbon excelerator unit dwaara kiye gaye pareekshanon ke mutabik, "95% se adhik kii sambhaavna ke saath, charmpatr 568 or 645 ke bich tha"
 The manuscript is written in the Hijaji script, an early form of Liza Arabic
 yah sambhawatah quran kaa sabase purana udhaaharan he, lekin pareekshanon kii ek vistrut taarikh kii anumati he, isliye yah nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa ki maujuuda sanskarnon main se koun sa sabase purana he
 Saudi scholar Saud al-sarhan has expressed doubts over the age of the fragments because they contain dots and chapter separators that are believed to have originated later
 muslimon kaa maananaa he ki quran 23 saal kii avadhi main allaah ne jibril ke madhyam se ishwar se mohammad se divya maargdarshan kii pustak ban gaya he or quran ko maanavtaa ke liye bhagwaan ke antim prakaashan ke rup main dekhtaa he
 Revelation in Islamic and Quranic contexts means the act of God addressing a person, sending a message to a large number of recipients
 jis prakriya se ishwar ke sandeshvahak ke dil main divine sandesh aata he vah tanzil yaa nuzul he
 As the Quran states, "with the truth we have sent it down and with the truth it has come down
 " The Quran often emphasizes in its text that it is divinely ordained
 quran main kuch chand yah ingit karte hai ki arabi bolne vaale bhi log quran ko samajhenge agar unhen sunaaya jaataa he
 The Quran refers to a written pre-text, "protected tablet", which records the speech of God even before it is sent
 quran shaashvat yaa banaaya gaya mudda yah mudda nauveen shatabdi main ek dharmik bahes ban gaya
 Mu'tazilas, an Islamic school of theology based on logic and rational thought, stated that the Quran was created, while the most widespread varieties of Muslim theologians considered the Quran to be co-eternal with God and therefore unskilled
 sufi darshanik is sawaal ko kritrim yaa galat tareeke se taiyaar karte hai
 Muslims believe that the current word of the Quran is revealed to Muhammad, and according to their interpretation of Quran 15: 9, it is protected from corruption
 muslim quran ko maardarshak maanate hai, mohammad kii bhavishyavaanee or dharm kii sachai kaa sanket
 The uniqueness of the Quran is the belief that the Quran cannot be compared to any human dialect or any material
 quran ko musalamaanon dwaara ek athulaneey chamatkaar mana jaataa he, jo yom al-qiyama ke din tak prabhavi hota he, or is prakaar, mohammad ko unke bhavishyavaaniyon kii sthiti ke pramanikaran main kendriya pramaan pradaan kiya jaataa he
 The concept of indispensability arises in the Quran, where in five different verses, opponents are challenged to produce something like the Quran: "if humans and jinn are bound together to produce a voice like this Quran" So they will never be able to do this, if they can support themselves with each other and see
 " to suzav yah he ki yadi quran ke divya lekhakatv se sambandhit andeh hai, to aage aaen or aisa kuch banaaen
 From the ninth century, many people and works appeared that studied the Quran and examined its style and content
 al-jurjani or al-baqillani sahit madhyayugin muslim vidwaanon ne is vishay par kai granthon ko likhaa he, iske vibhinn pahaluon par charchaa kii he, or quran kaa adhyayan karne ke liye bhashaai drushtikon kaa upyog kiya he
 Others argue that the Quran has great ideas, internal meanings, maintaining its freshness through the ages
 or quran ke zariye vyaktigat str par or itihaas main bade badlaav hue hai
 Some scholars say that the Quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science
 quran kii chamatkarita ke siddhant par mohammad kii nirakshartaa par jor diya gaya he kyonki agyaat bhavishyadvaktaa ko quran likhane kii kshamta kaise hogi
 That is why this is the voice of God
 quran kaa pehla sura sura e fatiha dainik prarthanaaon or anya avasaron main padhaa or doharaaya jaataa he
 This sura, which consists of seven verses, is the most frequently read sura of the Quran: shuru karata hoon khuda ke naam se jo bada meharbaan nihaayat raham vaala he; sab tarif khuda hi ke liye hai zo sabaqa rab ar maaliq he; or saare jahaann kaa paalane vaala bada meharbaan raham vaala he; roze jaza kaa maalik he; kudaaya ham teri hi ibaadat karte hai or tujh hi se madad chaahate hai; to hamako sidhi raah par sabit qadam rakhwa; unki raah jinhen tuune naimat ata kii he na unki raah jin par tera gazab dhaayaa gaya or na gumraahon kii
 " quran ko anya varg bhi dainik prarthanaaon main padhate hai
 Respect for the written text of the Quran is an important element of religious belief by many Muslims, and the Quran is treated with respect
 parampara ke aadhaar par or quran kii ek shabdic vyakhya 56:79, kuch musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki unhen quran kii ek prati chune se pehle vazu karnaa hoga, haalanki yah vichaar nahin he saarvbhaumik

 In Islam, most intellectual disciplines, including Islamic theology, philosophy, mysticism, and jurisprudence, are concerned with the Quran or have their foundations in their teachings
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki quran ke prachaar yaa padhanaa adhik praadhanyata rakhata he
 Those who preach and study it are rewarded with divine rewards
 aisa karnaa vibhinn prakaar ke ajahar, sawab yaa hasanh kaha jaataa he
 The Quran also inspired the Islamic arts and especially the so-called Quranic arts of calligraphy and illumination
 quran ko chitrakaari chhaviyon se kabhi sajaayaa nahin jaataa he, lekin kai kuranon ko prishth ke margin main yaa linon ke bich yaa sure kii shuruyaat main sajaavati pattern ke saath sajaayaa jaataa he
