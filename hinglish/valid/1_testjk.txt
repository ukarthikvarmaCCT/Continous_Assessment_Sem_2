 roopak yaa feechar logon ko ruchikar lagane vaala aisa kathatmak lekh he jo haal ke hi samaacharon se judaa nahin hota balki vishesh log, sthaan, yaa ghatana par kendrit hota he
 Metaphors have great depth in terms of detail
 aaj feechar lekhan tathaa uske prastutikaran kaa aadhunik patrakarita main atyadhik mahatv ho gaya he
 If news is the backbone of journalism, then the beauty enhancing power of feature journalism
 patrakarita main samachar jahaan taatkaalik ghatnaon kaa tatthypurna abhilekh hota he to roopak yani feechar samachar ke tatkaal swaroop se alag uskaa vistaar, uskaa sachitr prastutikaran yaa usase jude sampoorn ghatnakram kaa vivaran prastut karata he
 Due to the lack of space in modern journalism, the limit of words in news writing has been fixed and a journalist has to say everything in the same word limit
 aise main feechar, patrkaar ke liye ek madadgaar ke taur par kaam karata he
 a lot can be said, written or presented in a very small space through graphics, pictures, sketches and brief presentations in the feature
 roopak kaa vikaas vivarnaatmak rachanaaon se hua he lekin shabdon or sthaan kii seemaa ke chalate ab feechar bhi sankshipt hone lage hai
 Although brief, the feature's importance has not diminished but rather increased
 feechar main samachar ke vistaar ko hi ek vishesh takanic ke saath prastut kiya jaataa he
 For this, the feature writer has to find out who is the main subject or main character of the news
 What are the key elements associated with the main topic of the news? Le Khak also has to give a personal touch to it while presenting this lesson
 maanviya bhaawanaaon ke sparsh ke saath-saath manoranjak dhang se prastut feechar adhik lokapriy hote he kyonki unase vishay ke sampoorn tatthyon kii jaankaree ke saath-saath pathak, shrota yaa darshak kaa manoranjan bhihota he
 News ends by giving a description and consideration of the facts, while the feature describes the environment of the event or topic, various aspects and its effects
 samachar main likhane vaale ke vichaar athwa uske vyaktitv kii jhalak nahin hoti jabaki feechar main lekhak kii vichaardhaara, uski kalpanashiltaa ke saath-saath uske vyaktitv kii bhi jhalak milti he
 The feature has the primacy of the narrative element, meaning that there is both ease and fluency in its writing or presentation
 lekin feechar mahaj katha nahin hota
 The feature works to soothe the curiosity of the readers by delving deeper into the subject rather than getting lost in the imaginary things
 feechar lekhan ek kalatmak kaam he or kisi bhi patrkaar ko acha feechar lekhak banane ke liye - Feature is a mode of presentation of news, but compared to news, the feature explains the subject through in-depth study, pictures, research and interviews
 uskaa vistrut prastutikaran hotahai or yah sab kuch itane sahaj or rochak dhang se hota he ki pathak uske bahaav main bandhata chalaa jaataa he
 Scholars of journalism and literature have coined different definitions of metaphor
 ek paribhaasha ke anusaar, By another definition, ek anya paribhaasha main to feechar ko 'samachar patr kii aatma' kah diya gaya he
 In general terms, the news work is finished by giving elements and ideas
 jabaki feechar kaa kaam isse aage kaa hota he
 It reveals the background of the news, details the birth and development of the subject or event
 yah vishay athwa ghatana kaa puraa khulaasa bhi karte hai or pathak ko kuch sochane ke liye bhi vivash karte hai
 The significance of a good feature is in how much it affects the minds and minds of its readers
 feechar lekhak ghatana yaa vishay ke bare main apni pratikriya yaa vichaar bhi pathak ko batalaata he or is tarah pathak kii kalpana shakti ko or uski vaicharik manahosthiti ko bhi prabhavit karata he
 The importance of the feature lies in how it goes beyond the news that clarifies the when, why, how, where and who it leaves a special impact through the balanced presentation of the concept and idea
 feechar kaa ek mahatv yah bhi he ki yah pathak ke man main kisi khabar ko padhane ke baad paidaa hui jigyaasa ko bhi santusht karata he
 Nowadays the use of features in newspapers is increasing day by day
 europe main jari jabardast sardi or himpat par bhartiya bhashaai akhabaaron main vistrut samaacharon ke liye sthanbhav ho saktaa he
 But by presenting the same subject in a small space through an illustrated feature, newspapers can also overcome their problem of relocation and the reader also gets complete information about snow-fed Europe
 isi tarah kisi sthaneey durghatana ke samachar ke saath-saath agar us tarahaki anya ghatnaon kaa vivaran, rokthaam ke upayon, prabhaviton ke anubhav aadi ek sachitr feechar ke rup main prastut kar diya jaataa he to isse pathak ko sampoorn jaankaree ek saath mil jaati he
 This use of the feature has greatly enhanced the importance of the feature today
 is badhate mahatv ke kaaran feechar lekhan bhi ab patrakarita kii ek mahatvapurn vidha ho gai he
 Along with this, the importance of feature writers is also increasing
 aaj samachar patron main feechar desk kaa mahatv bhi bad gaya he or unki upyogita bhi
 In newspapers, due to the feature, more attention is being given to better presentation and urgency
 kai bade akhbaar samoohon main ab kendriyakrut feechar lekhan vyavastha bhi shuru ho gai he jiske tahat mahatvapurn vishyon par feechar taiyaar kar akhbaar ke sabhi sanskarnon ke liye bhej die jate hai
 The wonders of the Internet and information technology have made feature writing easier today
 lekin inhen chamatkaaron ke kaaran aaj feechar lekhan ke kshetra main nai chunautiyaan bhi khadi ho gai he
 Today the feature writer has to pay maximum attention to the fact that all the elements in his feature are perfect, fresh, expedient and they can also solve all the curiosities of the reader
 feechar, patrakarita kii ek aisi vidha he jisamen lekhan ko niyamon kii kisi khaas seemaa main nahin baandha ja saktaa
 Feature writing is very popular in developed countries as a genre of journalism
 chunki bharat main patrakarita kaa janm or vikaas raajnneeti ke saath hua he isliye yahan feechar kii vikaas yatra apekshaakrit der se shuru hui
 Here pen was used as a sword in early journalism
 aazaadee ke baad ke varsho main or vishesh rup se apatkaal ke baad ke varsho main akhabaaron ne raajnneeti se itar jivan ke vrihattar ayaamon kikhoj karne or jivan ko uski samagrata main dekhne samajhane kaa kaam tej kar diya tha
 Due to this, a distinct style of feature writing developed in our country
 printing technology main aae krantikari parivartanon ne feechar lekhan kii upyogita, jarurat or mahatv teenon ko dwiguneet kar diya he
 The main rule of feature creation is that the feature should be attractive, realistic and entertaining
 vartmaan main feechar ke liye kisi khaas prakaar kaa le aaut, saaj sajja, aakaar-prakaar yaa shabd seemaa kaa bandhan nahin rah gaya he
 Today, feature creation is being considered more important, at least in words
 isi tarah ab ek vishay par ek badi rachana ke bajaay ek saath choti-choti kai soochnaaon-samagriyon ko prastut karke bhi feechar likhe jane lage hai
 Broadly, 5 main things are kept in mind for feature writing- feechar lekhan ek kala bhi he or ab jabaki feechar kaa swaroop badal rahaa he to feechar lekhan kii takanic or tareeke bhi badal rahen hai
 Currently the feature is changing its traditional styles and definitions and changing the new forms
 mahakampur, sanrgarh mandal main bharat ke chhattisgarh rajya ke antargat raigarh jile kaa ek gaanv he
 The original history as Audichya Brahmin is found from around the year 950 AD
 gyaat hota he ki, varsh 942 i
 main mulraj solanki ne apane mamaa va tatkaaleen raja samant singh chaawda kii hatya kar anhilpur patan ke singhaasana par kabja kar liya tha
 In those days, crimes such as the murder of the ruling king and the killing of priests were considered unforgivable crimes whose punishment was self-immolation and whose refinement was possible only by the Shrimali Brahmins
 par, jab mulraj, shrimalion ke priy rahe raja samant singh kii hatya ke apradhi ke rup main kukhyat ho gaye to is jaghanya aparaadh ke parimarjan va mulraj ko raja ghoshit karne se shrimali brahmanon ne kadai se manaa kar diya
 These priest Brahmins of Gujarat, who have been associated with the Chavada kings for a long time, came from Shrimal Vividmal, which is located in the southern part of Rajasthan
 shrimali brahman rajya ke sarkari yaajak the
 His works included religion and justice
 unhone mulraj ko aashirwad dene or use raja ke rup main ghoshit karne se manaa kar diya tha
 By no means did they explain, money, threat etc
 had no effect on those Brahmins
 tab ek aghoshit raja ke rup main hi mulraj ne praayshchitaswarup 'rudra yajna' karne or ek vishaal rudra mandir banane kaa sankalp liya
 Even then the Shrimali Brahmins did not accept the priests
 mulraj ke aatmadah par ade yaachak shrimali brahmanon ko tab gujarat rajya ke bhavi vinaash or araajaktaa ke bare main bataaya gaya par unke upar iskaa bhi koi asar nahin padaa
 At the same time many Chavada descendants also began to claim claims to the throne
 rajya kii seemaa par dushmano ne gujarat ko jeetne ke liye apni sargharmiyaan tej kar di thi
 If the state was to be maintained then surely there was a great need for reconciliation between Moolraj and Srimalis, but Srimali priests did not favor to free Moolraj from killing even after understanding the circumstances
 antat mulraj ke mitron or mantrimandal ke sadasyon ne gopneey rup se desh ke bhinn-bhinn ilaakon se vidwaan brahmanon ko laakar basaane va unhen vah sab dene kaa nirnay liya jo abtak shrimalion ko miltaa rahaa tha
 Immediately, many teams under the leadership of Minister Madhav were sent to various important and Brahmin-dominated areas located in the plains of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers to do this work, and the scholars of the Brahmins were attracted by the temptation of breathtaking permanent migration and unique state patronage and order
 Convinced to come to Gujarat
 kisi bhavi sajeesh se bachane ke liye, yah bhi yah sunishchit kiya gaya ki sab brahmanon ko alag-alag sthanon se laayaa jaye
 Moolraj and his minister Madhava gave preference to the Brahmins called from Kanyakubj, the land of their forefathers, in order to reduce the supremacy of the former Shrimali Brahmins, among others
 isprakaar mulraj khud ek vaidya raja ho saktaa or nawangtuk brahman pariwaron par uski pakad bhi bani rahati
 Thus according to the plan, a large caravan of 1037 Brahmin families reached Sidhpur Patan
 abtak aghoshit raja mulraj ne kahe gaye vaadon se adhik kii suvidha dilava kar unhen sadaa ke liye apana bana liya
 Traditionally Brahmins were known by their place of stay or origin
 atah uttar disha se aane ke kaaran or ateet ke vibhinn gotro se milakar bane brahmanon ke is bade samooh ko aadhikarik taur par sahastra audichya brahman namit kiya gaya tha
 In Sanskrit, audichya refers to the northern direction
 isprakaar gotra mul yathaavat rahaa or sthaan raja mulraj solanki dwaara pradutt, shri sthal, jo kalantar main siddhpur patan ke rup main janaa jaataa he, vahi unka sthaayee sthaan bana
 Thus the names and numbers of gotras originated according to the families settling at their place of origin

 1037 pariwaron main se 37 pariwaron ne shrimali brahmanon ke tark main sachai samaj kar raja kii yojana main bhaag nahin karne kaa faisla kiya
 They went apart in a group
 unka nirnay mulraj ko suchit
karne ke baad se ve ek samooh ke saath alag chale gaye, ve tolakia audichya brahman ke rup main jane jate the
 The rest of the Oudichyas are known as Sahasra Brahmins
 kyonki ve 1000 kii sankhya main aaye the
 Having more than 1000 Brahmin families dominated
 raja mulraj solanki ne dusre paksh ke brahmanon ko samajhaayaa
 This was necessary to maintain a strong state and to stabilize the religion and civilization as well as the trade and prosperity of the nation
 kii un sabko bhi apana bana kar rakhaa jaye iske liye jaruri tha
 It is a well-known fact that Gujarat had flourished as a Solanki state for nearly three hundred years, capable and full of prosperity
 baad main 1297 main bharat par islamic hamale ke kaaran nasht hua tha
 Vedic religion is considered to be the oldest known religion
 
 Hinduism believes that eternal truth is one

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga karm yoga yoga karmo kishlayam arthath karm main leen hona
 Yoga: Karmasu Kaushalam
 is yoga main karm ke dwaara ishwar kii prapti kii jaati he
 In the Srimad Bhagavadgita, Karmayoga is considered the best
 grihasth or karmath vyakti ke liye yah yoga adhik upyukt he
 Each of us is engaged in some work, but most of us lose most of our powers in vain; Because we do not know the secret of karma
 jivan kii raksha ke liye, samaaj kii raksha ke liye, desh kii raksha ke liye, vishwa kii raksha ke liye karm karnaa aavashyak he
 But it is also true that grief originates from karma
 saare du:kha or ksht aasakti se utpann hua karte hai
 a person wants to do deeds, he wants to do good to a man and there is also a strong possibility that the obliged person will be ungrateful and will work against the well-to-do
 is prakaar sukruty bhi du:kha detaa he
 The result is that this type of incident drives man away from karma
 yah du:kha yaa ksht kaa bhay karm or shakti kaa bada bhaag nasht kar detaa he
 Karmayog teaches that do karma for karma, do deeds without attachment
 karmyogi isiilie karm karata he ki karm karnaa use acha lagata he or iske pare uskaa koi hetu nahin he
 The Karmayogi does not renounce Karma, he only renounces the Karmapha and becomes free from the sorrow of the Karmajit
 uski sthiti is sansar main ek daata ke samaan he or vah kuch paane kii kabhi chintaa nahin karata
 He knows that he is giving and does not ask for anything in return and that is why he does not fall into the clutches of sorrow
 vah jaanata he ki du:kha kaa bandhan ‘aasakti’ kii pratikriya kaa hi fal hua karata he
 It is said in the Gita that the equanimity feeling of the mind is yoga in which a person accepts happiness-sorrow, gain-loss, victory-loss, coincidence-disconnection in the mind in the same sense
 karm-fal kaa tyaag kar dharmanirpeksh kaary kaa sampaadan bhi puja ke samaan ho jaataa he
 No function of the world is different from Brahm
 isliye kaary kii prakruti koi bhi ho nishkaam karm sadaa ishwar ko hi samarpit ho jaataa he
 The cause of rebirth is the accumulation of lusts or unquenchable desires
 karmyogi karmfal ke chakkar main hi nahin padataa, at: vaasanaon kaa sanchay bhi nahin hota
 In this way, the Karmayogi also becomes free from the bondage of rebirth
 karmyog kaa pratipaadan gita main vishad se hua he
 In Indian philosophy, karma is considered the cause of bondage
 kintu karmyog main karm ke us swaroop kaa nirupan kiya gaya he jo bandhan kaa kaaran nahin hota
 Yoga means attainment of equality
 siddhi or asiddhi, safalataa or vifaltaa main sam bhav rakhana samatv kehalaata he
 Yoga also has another meaning
 vah he karmon kaa kushalta se sampadan karnaa 
 It means to act in such a way that it does not create bondage
 ab prashn yah he ki koun se karm bandhan utpann karte hai or koun se nahin? gita ke anusaar jo karm nishkaam bhav se ishwar ke liye jate hai ve bandhan nahin utpann karte
 They help in the attainment of salvation form
 is prakaar karmfal tathaa aasakti se rahit hokar ishwar ke liye karm karnaa vaastavik rup se karmyog he or iskaa anusaran karne se manushya ko abhyuday tathaa ni:shreyas kii prapti hoti he
 According to the Gita, Karmayog is better than taking retirement or abandoning them
 karmon kaa keval parityag kar dene se manushya siddhi athwa parampad nahin praapt karata
 Man does not live for a single moment without performing actions
 sabhi agyani jeev prakruti se utpann satv, raj or tam, in teen gunon se niyantrit hokar, paravash hue, karmon main pravrutt kiye jate hai
 Even if man does not act outwardly and does not indulge in subjects, he contemplates them from his heart
 is prakaar kaa manushya mudh or mithyaa aacharan karanevaala kaha gaya he
 It is compulsory for humans to do deeds
 uske bina sharir kaa nirvaah bhi sambhav nahin he
 Lord Krishna himself says that he has no duty in the three worlds
 unhen koi bhi aprapt vastu praapt kerani nahin rahati
 Yet they remain engaged in karma
 yadi ve karm na karen to manushya bhi unke chalaae hue maarg kaa anusaran karne se niskriy ho jaayenge
 Due to this, there will be lack of deeds done for the public situation, which will result in the destruction of all subjects
 isliye atmagyaani manushya ko bhi, jo prakruti ke bandhan se mukt ho chukaa he, sadaa karm karte rahanaa chahie
 Just as an ignorant person works with the desire to achieve fruit, similarly the enlightened person should do deeds unachievable for public gathering
 is prakaar atmagyaan se sampann vyakti hi, gita ke anusaar, vaastavik rup se karmyogi ho saktaa he

 is baar yash janmdin ke maukey par nandita ko bataur tohafaa ek apartment detaa he, ve nai jindagi kii shuruyaat karte he or donon prem main lipt hote hai, kuch vakt baad nandita garbhvatee hoti he
 One evening, Nandita encounters a very aspiring artist named Prithvi who reaches him in search of his masterpiece
 prithvi use bataata he ki 4 maah pehle usne ek ladki kii scaching banaai thi, jo asal main nandita kii thi
 He also shows the painting in which his wrist is lying on the cut
 vah nandita se kisi bhi khatre ke prati chaukas rahane ko aagaah karata he
 But ignoring the matter of Prithvi, Nandita suddenly has a phantom cut her wrist in the bathroom
 prithvi use bachaata he or aspataal main bharti karaata he
 Yash rushes to the hospital and tries to find out her pregnancy and tells that her abortion is now difficult due to excessive bleeding
 vah yash se prithvi ke bare main shikaayat karti he, or yash use giraftaar karata he,magar jald hi vah vahaan se chhut jaataa he
 Meanwhile, at Kalindi, the American, David Cooper, who owns Kalindi's chemical factory, also writes himself with his own blood on the wall of his room before hanging himself, saying, "you are impure, Rotten from inside "
 vahiin is aatmahatya kii tahakiqaat kar rahaa inspector bhi iske buree prabhaav kii chapet main aata he
 Back in his house, Prithvi makes another picture in which a mob attacks Nandita
 vah us fishan sho main jaataa he jahaan nandita apana pradarshan karti he, or usapar jaise bhoot savaar hota he or sho main upasthit ek aadhyatmik guru par hamalaa kar baithti he
 She then repeats the same lines, telling him, "you are impure, rotten inside"
 prithvi use bachaane ko daudta he, magar vahaan maujuud guard dwaara roak liya jaataa he
 Nandita is kept away from the teacher and the audience
 kuch vakt baad tivi par guru ji kaa saakshaatkaar dikhaaya jaataa he, jo nandita par kisi pret ke haaavee hone kii baat kehete hai
 Knowing everything there, Yash publicly apologizes the most, and reveals that he is in fact troubled by mental problems
 udhar gards ke haathon prithvi ke chhootane baad, nandita ko phir se bathroom main vah pret dikhaai padataa he, jo dubaara vahi panktiyaan shishe main likh di jaati he
 She goes to ask for help from Earth, but he denies her, showing the picture in which she has hanged herself and the same lines are written near her
 phir vah us samachar kii cliping bhi dikhaata he jisamen us pujari or david kupar kii maut hui he,or unheen peeche vahi samaan panktiyaan likhi gai thi
 Nandita thanks her and reaches Yash's convening party to attend
 par vahaan pahunch kar bhi bhoot usape haaavee hota he or, khud ko hi ghayal karti he or khun bahane lagata he
 Meanwhile, the Earth is ready for his help by burning that wretched future picture of Nandita, betraying that he will save her life
 vah nandita ko party se bhaagate dekh letaa he, khun se tar, or phir vah uske peeche pad jaataa he
 Eventually he finds her in a slum area, where she was writing the same lines repeating
 prithvi use rokane kii koshish karata he magar vah jaan jaataa he ki nandita par pret haaavee he
 Nandita tries her best to be happy but the earth stops her from doing so
 yash tabhi bhaagta hua pahunchataa he or nandita ko prithvi kii banhon main paata he
 Yash would then agree to help Nandita but on condition that she leave the Earth, but she refuses to take his help and decides to walk with the Earth so that Kalindi can go and find this truth
 us shaam prithvi or nandita guest house main raat gujaarte hai or agali subah ravaanaa hote hai
 After a full day's journey, they reach Kalindi and meet the wife of the priest who tells that her husband had himself indulged in such misdeeds and that he would not be surprised at his death, this would probably be the reason for his death
 He may have committed the crime of playing with many innocent people in the name of religion
 phir to vah log us police inspector ke ghar jane kaa faisla lete he,, jahaan vah log pate hai ki puri tarah pagal ho chukaa he or naa hi is laayak ki use khudkhushi karne se roka jaae
 Nandita and Prithvi return the same evening, after unexpected evidence is not found
 raste main nandita aane vaale anjaamon ko or sah nahin paane ke kaaran vah prithvi se aatmahatya karne kii darkhaast karti he
 Prithvi assures him that they will find the truth together
 tabhi unki car ko kai saare maveshi bhainson kaa jhund roktaa he or ek bifaraya sand unki car ko takkar jadte hue palat detaa he
 Nandita gets out of the car, tries desperately to get out of the earth
 phir vahi pret use jangal kii ore le jaataa he jahaan usapar dubaara aasmaanya dhang se hamalaa he
 Then many people are seen hanging on the trees
 iske baad vah ek kuen ke yahaan paati he or dekhati he vahaan koi najadik khadaa he, vah uski ore badhati he
 In this, she jumps into the well, the earth also leaps and grabs her behind
 yah jaanate hue ki kuen kii diwaar ek sidhi khadi chattan kii tarah he
 Within the well, Nandita knows that it is the father of the earth, Veer Pratap Singh, who continues to dominate her
 yah sab tab shuru hua jab unhen kalindi ke rasinic kaarkaane se nikle jahrile kachare ko nadi main bahaae jane kii baat maaloom hui or jahaan har varsh hajaaron shraddhalu is pavitra anushthan main sarovar main snaan karne pahonchte hai
 They also go to the police station to file a complaint against David Cooper, but the same policemen and temple priests threaten not to take any action, otherwise they will risk their lives themselves by disrupting the sacred ritual
 iske pratyuttar main vah unako kahata he, "tum ashuddh ho, andar se sad chuke ho"
 Veer Pratap tries to reveal all this truth to everyone, but soon the priests' battered lathi beat him to death, but somehow he falls into the well in a round of saving lives
 marane ke baad vah ruh banakar apana badla lete hai
 In this way, he gets to know David Cooper, and the policemen and priests who accompany him
 prithvi aakhir main yah sachai jaan to letaa ho, magar vah samaj nahin paata is maamle main nandita isamen kyun ulajh rahi he
 Here, Yash reaches Nandita with her Lashkar in the morning
 usee shaam prithvi ko nandita kaa ek or daraavna sapana dikhaai detaa he, vah fouran farsh par uski tasviir banaata he jahaan is baat kii soochna thi ki aaj uski hatya honi he
 At the same time, it becomes known that Yash's death of Veer Pratap Singh is all evidence, but he gave that evidence to David only for the purpose of his show
 nandita us saboot ko dhundne ke liye bhaagane kii koshish karti he magar isse pehle yash usapar goli chalaa hi detaa, prithvi vahaan pahunch kar nandita ko bachaa letaa he
 But the dice turns, yash cleverly injures the earth
 ant main, vir pratap kii aatma prakat hokar yash ko uske kiye kaa dand miltaa he or maaraa jaataa he
 With this, the wounds of the earth heal as soon as Veer Pratap passes away
 vahiin tamaam hatyaon ke sabooton tathaa kalindi ke sarovar kii vifailli hone kii pramanikta par anushthan sambandhi parv ke saath us rasinic kaarkaane ko bhi band kar diya jaataa he
 Prithvi and Nandita start life afresh
