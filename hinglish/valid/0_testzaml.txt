 Despite the advent of many modern methods of pricing and portfolio selection and arbitrage empirical flaws, CAPM is still more prevalent due to its generality and usefulness in a wide variety of circumstances

 For a single security, we use the securities market line and its relationship with expected return and systemic risk to determine how much the price of a single market will be determined by the market compared to its risk category
 pratibhuti bazaar rekha se kisi ek sampatti kii puure bazaar kii tulana main pratifal-jokhim anupaat kii gananaa bhi kii ja sakati he
 Hence, as the expected return of an asset will decrease by its beta coefficient, the return-risk ratio of this single asset will be equal to the return-risk ratio of the entire market
 is prakaar: The market-to-risk ratio is effectively the market risk premium / premium and by re-employing the above equation and assuming E, we get the capital asset pricing model
 jahaan: If this is rewritten from the risk premium point of view, we find that: arthath kisi parisampatti kaa "apana jokhim premium"- "bazaar jokhim premium" va "beta" kaa gunanfal he

 The relationship between β and expected return is depicted on the securities market line, which represents the expected return as a function of β
 The intercept is the bazaar main uplabdh nominal jokhim mukt dar he, jabaki dhalaan market premium he, E− Rf
 It can be said that the securities market line represents as a single-factor model of the asset price, while β shows how likely it is to be affected by market changes, thus the SML equation is : aisi paristhitiyon ke liye yah ek ati mahatvapurn tul he jab pataa karnaa ho ki kya koi parisampatti / pratibhuti jokhim kii tulana main ek sweekaarya pratifal degi ki nahin
 Solitary assets are depicted on the securities market line graph

 For this we will need to calculate an independent estimate of the return on assets, which is usually done by fundamental or technical analysis, proportional analysis, etc
 siepiem ke anusaar, yadi anumaanit mulya, sampatti ke siepiem dwaara sujhai dar ke saath samyojit kiye gaye bhavishya nakadapravaah ke baraabar he - to sampatti sahi mulya par mil rahi he
 If the estimated value is higher than the CAPM valuation, the property is cheaper

 Since the expected return of the property at timepoint t { \ displaystyle t} is e = e - p t p t { \ displaystyle e = { \ frac {E-P_ {t}} {P_ {t xxrep 5 } as suggested by the CAPM If the return exceeds, it means that p t { \ displaystyle P_ {t}} is too low, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t + 1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 siepiem kaa prayog karne par parisampatti kaa mulya p 0 { \ displaystyle P_{0}}, nimna leniyar sambandh se pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he: Where PT { \ displaystyle P_ {T}} is the payoff of the asset or portfolio

 If the value of beta is more than one, it means - above average risk; Less than one means - below average risk
 is prakaar, kisi zyada jokhim vaale stock kaa beta adhik hoga or unhen adhik dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 Whereas less sensitive stocks will have lower beta and will be adjusted at a lower rate
 yah prachlit anaupchaarik dharna, ki adhik jokhim lene vaale niveshak adhik pratifal kii ichha rakhte hai, ke anuroop hi he
 Because beta is the measure of the vulnerability of a single asset to full market risk, it is clear from the definition that beta will be a measure of market risk: 1
 bazaar jokhim maapne ke liye ek poorak paimaane ke rup main stock market index kaa prayog bahutayat main kiya jaataa he, atah inkaa beta maap 1 hota he
 Thus, investors of a large and well-defined portfolio can expect results from their investments according to market movements

 Systematic or market risk is due to the factors that affect all investment options, ie the entire market
 is prakaar ke jokhim par niyantran karnaa kathin he
 Disorganized risk is the risk that affects a particular security or investment option
 nivesh kaa vishaakhan karke aise jokhim ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context — ie its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness — as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance ie less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 siepiem maanata he ki kisi nivesh ke jokhim-pratifal anupaat ko durust kiya ja saktaa he, ek adarsh portpholio vah hoga jo ki ek nirdhaarit pratifal dar ke liye nunatam jokhim ke saath ho
 Additionally, as each new asset added to the portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above
 All such optimal portfolios, ie, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 An investor can also invest some part of his fund in risky assets and save some cash, which can be earned at a risk-free rate
 
 Here the ratio of risky and risk free does not determine the overall return - this relationship is definitely linear
 is prakaar se yah sambhav he ki nimna don main se kisi ek prakaar ek nishchit return praapt kiya ja saktaa he : However for a fixed return, only one of the above options would prove to be efficient
 chunki jokhimamukt sampatti paribhaashatah kisi bhi anya sampatti se correlated nahin he, dwitiya vikalp main saamanytah kam vichlan hoga jiske kaaran yah donon main se adhik kushal hoga
 This relationship would also hold true for other portfolios on the effective range: some cash with a higher return - is more efficient - rather than just a portfolio with lower returns at the same return rate
 ek nishchit jokhimamukt dar ke liye, ek hi kushal portpholio hoga jise ki nakadi ke saath milakar kisi bhi pratilabh ke liye nunatam jokhim kii sthiti praapt kii ja sakati he
 This is the market portfolio

 At the end of Strikes Again, Dreyfus appears to disintegrate, but later and without any details, the Revenge of the Pink Panthe begins, he is again found in the hospital and Klauso accidentally declared dead
 He is again allowed to return to the post as Chief Inspector
 harbart lom prasiddhi sahit apane paatr ko ek spasht khinchaav detaa he, jo tab ghatit hota he jab vah vishesh rup se tanaav main hota he or clouso kii hatya kii sajeesh karne ke samay bachche kii tarah kilkaari bharta he
 In Sun of the Pink Panther, Dreyfus poses as Klauso and tackles his clown son Jack Gambrelli
 clouso ke saath apane sambandhon kii tulana main, drephus gambrelli ke prati adhik udaar he
 At the end of the film, Dreyfus marries Klauso's ex-girlfriend, Maria Gambrelli
 shaadi ke resepshan main, drephus ko yah jaanakar jhatka lagata he ki asal main clouso or maaria ke judwa bachche the: jaik or jacleen gambrali
 In a 2006 reboot of The Pink Panther, Dreyfus uses Klauso as a seduction while he attempts to solve the crime himself
 drephus clouso ko maatr ek bevakoof samajhataa he or kabhi bhi use maarane kii koshish nahin karata jabaki clouso ek baar use pahchaanane main galati kar apane maalik par hamalaa kar detaa he
 Later in the film, Dreyfus is accidentally dragged behind Klauso's smart car
 drephus aspataal main khatm ho jaataa he, jahaan clouso ke anaadipan kii vajah se vah khidki ke baahar gir jaataa he
 However, in the 2009 episode, Dreyfus played a much smaller role than her debut

 In the 2009 episode, John Kleiss played the role in place of Klein
 keto clouso kaa gharelu naukar he or marshall art main nipun he
 It is not clear whether he considers Klauso a great detective or merely makes fun of him by saying so
 yah ek prachlit majaak he ki clouso ke apratyaashit hamale se nipatane or satarkta ke kaushal ko tej rakhane ke liye use clouso par hamalaa karne ke nirdesh mili hue hai
 Unfortunately, Keto takes these instructions very seriously, repeatedly attacking Klauso in his house, which results in ridiculous results
 is tarah ke hamale ke dauraan agar use roka jaataa he, tab keto hamalavar kii chhavi se baahar nikalakar ek anushasanpriya sevak kaa rup dhaaran kar letaa he
 In later films, Keto helps Klauso in some cases, including the Hong Kong case
 yahaan, keto apane ko chhipaane ke liye chashma pahentaa he lekin aspasht najar aane kii vajah se vibhinn vastuon se takaraane lagata he
 At first, Keto confirms his Chinese race by speaking and smiling in broken English, however, the Revenge of the Pink Panther finds that Keto is actually proficient in speaking fluent English, including nonstandard English
 yah suzav diya jaataa he ki donon vyaktiyon main pyaar-nafrat kaa sambandh he, kabhi-kabhi keto ke liye "nafrat" kaa paksh adhik haaavee rahata he
 In Revenge, Keto secretly runs a brothel in a part of Klauso's apartment, assuming his master is dead
 veshyalay main jane ke liye "inspector clouso" ke naam kaa password istemaal kiya jaataa tha jisaki vajah se us vakt kaaphi haasyaaspad drishy ban gaya jab khud inspector clouso vahaan aa jaataa he
 Keto opened another brothel at Curse of the Pink Panther and museumed the apartment of Inspector Clauso that housed the camouflage worn by the inspector over the years
 keto kii bhoomika cato par aadhaarit thi, jo da green hornett kaa sahaayak tha, uski bhoomika bruce lee ne nibhaai thi
 The list of a Shot in the Dark also used a "K" in her name, though it was changed to "C" in later performances

 Jackie Chen was offered the role of Keto at the time of the re-development
 antat, us charitra ko yah soch kar puri tarah se khatm kar diya gaya tha ki aadhunik darshakon ke liye chini rudhivaadee raajnneetik taur par atyadhik galat tha
 Keto is replaced by a new character Gendarme Gilbert Ponton, played by Jane Reno, and given the responsibility of keeping an eye on Inspector Klauso
 keto ke saath vyavastha ke vipareet, clouso aksar apratyaashit rup se pontone par hamale kiya karata tha, keto ke vipareet pontone hameshaa jhagade main jeeta karata tha
 Battles featured on Keto were always more destructive and prolonged than Ponton's battles

 French actor André Maranne has played the role of François in six Panther films, and was replaced by Dermot Crowley in Sun of the Pink Panther
 He later becomes Clauso's assistant

 "the Phantom" is a jewel thief who is Klauso's main enemy in many films and is known in public as Sir Charles Linton
 har aparaadh ke drishy main vah 'parichay card' chhod jaataa tha: jis par ek safed dastaane ke saath vishisht style main "pi" likhaa hota tha
 In the first film, he falls prey to the main villain and Klauso, but in the end, Linton, with the help of Klauso's wife and an evil princess, temporarily sends Klauso to prison by implicating him in the past of robberies
 Revenge takes Klauso Sellers / Edwards' third film in which Pink Panther is stolen from a museum in Lugash and Linton is the main suspect
 pehali film main yah bhoomika david niven dwaara or ritern main christopher plummar dwaara nibhaai gayi thi
 In later films, the elderly and frail Niven did a minor role, whose voice was dubbed by the impressionist Rich Little

 Each engineering campaign has special problems related to it and both small and big talent have an opportunity to solve them
 ejiniyari ek anuprayukt vigyaan he
 The importance of methodology in engineering is already there, but now it has become even more important
 isi ke parinamswaroop 'systams ejineering', 'gyaan ejiniyari' aadi kaa janm hua he
 Broadly, any engineer has to understand two things - 'aavashyaktaa' or pratibandhon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue ejeeniyar vinirdesh, aarekhan, gunvattta niyantran taiyaar karata he taaki aavashyak vastu yaa seva kaa nirmaan ho sake
 Often the engineer has more than one solution
 vah vividh vikalpon par vichaar karata he
 He evaluates the options from the technical, economic and security point of view and the one that produces the most appropriate results is chosen
 ejeeniyar kaa kaam bahut chunauti bharaa he
 Incorrect solutions can result in very costly or even very dangerous
 isaliye praayah ejeeniyar kisi hal ko lagu karne ke pehle uskaa pareekshan or vishleshan bhi karata he
 For this, he uses prototypes, use of small-sized or simplified models, simulation, collision or adhesion test and fatig test etc
 chunki galat hal kaa parinaam gambhir ho sakate he, isaliye ejeeniyar purv-nirmit halon ko apanaate samay ejeeniyar suraksha gunak kaa upyog karata he taaki dushprinaam kii sambhaavan bahut kam kii ja sake
 But the higher the security-gunner, the more expensive, larger, or less efficient the solution
 rus ke navasrujan visheshgy genrik aaltshular ne bahut se patenton kaa adhyayan karne ke baad nishkarsh nikaala tha ki chote-str ke ejiniyari hal samjhauton par aadhaarit hote hai jabaki bade-str ke kaam main ejeeniyar us hal ko chunata he jo samasya kii sabase badi kathinaayee ko dur karata ho
 The advent of computers brought about a fundamental change in the functioning of engineering
 pehle kisi cheez kii dizin ke liye lambi-lambi gananaayen kii jaatin thi, prayog kiye jate the, dizin samiksha hoti thi kintu ab inkaa sthaan computor simulation letaa ja rahaa he
 With the advent of 'finite Elements Method', the most difficult simulations of mechanics, hydrodynamics, electromagnetism, meteorology, thermodynamics, etc
 are being done
 paripathon kaa abhikalpan, paripathon ke le-out, paripathon kaa pareekshan aadi main computor software kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 In brief, the use of computers is being used everywhere in design, drafting, testing, construction and maintenance
 iske alaava ejeeniyar computer se har kadam par sahaayta praapt karata he - dizin main, utpaadan main or upkarnon ko sudhaarney main
 The use of computers in design leads to faster completion of work
 aajkal bahut se maamalon main computor dwaara modelling kar lene se mahange prototip ke nirmaan se chhutkaaraa mil jaataa he
 a database of already built technical solutions is also available in computer software nowadays
 ab to aankik rup se niyantrit mashiinon ko nirdesh de diye jate hai jisase utpaadan kii prakriya bahut saral ho gayi he

 Sugars influenza, also known as H1N1 or swine flu, is an infection spread by one of the various swine influenza viruses
 shookar influenza vishaanu, influenza kul ke vishaanuon kaa vah koi bhi upbhed he, jo ki siiron kii sthanikmaari ke liye uttaradaayi he
 SIV strains known as of 2009 include the subtypes H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2 and H2N3 of influenza c and influenza A
 is prakaar kaa influenza manushyon or pakshiyon par bhi prabhaav daalata he
 The swine influenza virus is common in suro worldwide
 is vishaanu kaa siiron se manushya main sancharan aam nahin he or hameshaa hi yah vishaanu maanav influenza kaa kaaran nahin banataa, aksar rakt main iske viruddh sirf pratipindon kaa utpaadan hi hota he
 If its transmission causes human influenza, then it is called zoonotic sugar influenza
 jo vyakti niyamit rup se siiron ke sampark main rahete he unhen is flu ke sankraman kaa jokhim adhik hota he
 If an infected pork is cooked properly, there is no risk of infection from its intake
 20veen shatabdi ke madhya me, influenza ke upaprakaron kii pahchaan sambhav ho gayi jiske kaaran, maanav main iske sancharan kaa sahi nidaan sambhav ho paaya
 Since then only 50 such transmissions have been confirmed
 shookar influenza ke yah upbhed birle hi ek maanav se duusare maanav main sanchaarit hote hai
 Symptoms of zoonotic sugar influenza in humans are similar to those of common influenza, such as chills, fever, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, severe headache, weakness, and general discomfort
 siiron main influenza sankraman ke kaaran fever, susti, cheenk, khaansi, saans lene main kathinaayee or bhukh kii kami ho sakati he
 In some cases this infection can cause miscarriage
 haalanki aamtaur par mrityu sirf 1-4% maamalon main hi hoti he
 This infection can affect the pig's weight loss and growth, which can cause economic loss to their foster parents
 sankramit boar kaa vajan 3 se 4 saptaah kii avadhi ke dauraan 5 se 6 kilogram tak ghat saktaa he
 The main symptoms of swine influenza in humans are: - kuch maamalon main shookar influenza vishaanu kaa sancharan, siiron se sidhe manushyon main hona sambhav he, is sthiti main ise zunotic shookar influenza kaha jaataa he
 Since 1958, only 50 such cases have been reported, out of which only 6 persons have died
 in chah logon main se ek garbhvatee mahila thi, ek ko leukemia tha, ek hozkin rog kaa shikaar tha or do log pehle se swasth the
 Even though these direct cases may seem very rare, the true rate of actual infection may be much higher than this, as in most cases it appears to be a common disease and is therefore unreported
 maanav influenza ke liye uttaradaayi, teen vansho ke influenza vishaanuon main se do, siiron main bhi influenza failaa sakate hai, jisame se influenza e to bahut aam he par influenza si yada kada hi paaya jaataa he
 Influenza b has not yet been observed in pigs
 influenza e or influenza si ke bheetar manushya or siiron main paye jane vaale upbhed bhinn hote hai haalanki pun:pruthakkaran ke kaaran upabhedon main bade paimaane jin kaa sthanantaran dekha gaya he chahen yah boar, pakshi yaa maanav prajati main upasthit ho
 The influenza c virus infects both humans and pigs but does not infect birds
 ateet main bhi iskaa sancharan siiron or insaanon ke bich hua he
 For example, influenza c caused a less effective type of influenza spread among children in Japan and California
 apni simit parposhi range or anuvanshik vividhta kii kami ke kaaran influenza si maanav main mahamari kaa kaaran nahin ban paaya he
 Sucker influenza, subtypes of influenza a H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, and H2N3
 Due to this
 puure vishwa main siiron main, teen influenza e vishaanu upaprakaar ech1en1, ech3en2 or ech1en2 sabase aam hai
 H1N1 came from Spanish Flu, an epidemic that spread during 1918 and 1919, killing approximately 50 million people
 jo virus spanish flu se aayaa vah siiron main vidyaman rahaa
 It also circulated in humans during the 20th century, although it occurs at the time of year when epidemics occur every year, making it difficult to distinguish between 'normal' influenza and sugar swine influenza
 haalanki suaron se manushyon main hone vaale sankraman ke maamle bahut viral hai or 2005 ke baad se america main 12 maamle paae gaye hai
 yahe == swine influenza in humans It spread to humans through swine

 The categories were originally union of craftsmen and traders
 inkaa lakshya tha sadasyon kii sahaayta karnaa
 Labor division was simple in the medieval era
 bade bade pechide hathiyaaron ke sthaan par saral hathiyaaron kaa prayog hota tha
 Towns were centers of industrial communities
 vahaan dastakaari kii vastuen taiyaar hoti thim
 The craftsmen living there were organized into categories
 tatkaaleen aarthik sanghathan main in shreniyon kaa mahatvapurn sthaan tha
 They were organized on the basis of profession
 ek shrenee ke log ek hi prakaar kaa pesha karte the
 The same categories of training required for the profession were also in the hands of these categories
 ye shreniyan aise logon ko bhi rakhti thim jo dur dur ke gaanvon tathaa bazaaron main jaakar dastakaari kii vastuon ko bechate the
 Their goal was not only to protect the interests of the members but also their importance was to maintain the high standard of art and to determine their fair value
 sadasyon ke parivaar ke anya sadsy bhi usee peshey main lag jate the
 In this way, knowledge reached in the form of succession in succession
 shilp tathaa vyapaarik shreniyon ke atirikt dharmik, raajnneetik tathaa saamaajik samasyaon ke samaadhaan hetu bhi shreniyon kaa sanghathan hua
 Categories in England date from the 9th century
 us samay rajya dwaara in shreniyon ko kuch vishesh suvidhaayen or adhikaar praapt the
 Establishing schools, constructing roads and bridges and protecting the members of the disaster were the prime targets of these categories
 prarambh main keval vyapaarik shreniyan thim parantu baad main ekadhikaar praapt ho jane ke kaaran in logon ne saadhaaran shilpiyon kaa shoshan prarambh kar diya
 For this reason, craftsmen also organized themselves into categories
 samay ke saath inaki upadeyata bhi badhati gai or shreniyon ne bahut hi drudh tathaa suvyavasthit sanghathan kaa rup liya
 In the struggle of ordinary citizens and the rich, these categories contributed significantly to protect the interests of ordinary citizens
 13veen shatabdi tak inkaa sanghathan bahut drudh ho chukaa tha or inhen raajnneetik adhikaar bhi praapt hone lage the
 The organization of the municipalities was based on these categories and their constitutions were also based on the categories
 aage chalakar shreniyon kaa mahatv itnaa adhik badha ki jo koi bhi swaittashasan main bhaag lenaa chahta tha, uske liye aavashyak sa ho gaya ki vah shrenee kaa sadsy ho jaae
 The Municipal Commissions of ancient India were also broad forms of these categories, and the tasks similar to those of the Municipal Commissions were similar to those categories in countries like England and Germany in the medieval period
 aage chalakar to ye shreniyan itani sampann ho gayi ki swatantra vyavsaay ke log bhi inamen sammilit hone lage
 The organization of most categories was on a democratic basis
 13veen or 14veen shatabdi england ke audyogic or vyavsaayik vikaas ke itihaas main mahatvapurn kaal he or in do shatabdiyon main shreniyon kaa vikaas bhi badi hi teevr gati se hua
 In this era, categories also developed in other countries of Europe, and the form of their organization and their goals were often the same
 in shreniyon kaa lakshya keval apane sadasyon kii spardhaa se raksha karnaa hi nahin apitu vastu kii utkrushtataa ko kaayam rakhana bhi tha
 The guardians were elected by the members to fulfill this purpose
 yadhyapi vyapaarik shreniyon tathaa shilp shreniyon ke hit vipareet the tathaapi in donon main pratyaksh sangharsh kaa varnan praaia: nahin ke hi samaan he
 Conflicts must have occurred in the 16th century and through these the craftsmen threw the yoke of the elite government from their shoulders and in the 15th and 16th century we see visions of merging into different categories
 audyogic kranti ke pehle se hi shreniyon kii vicchhinnata ke lakshan spasht hone lage the
 The Industrial Revolution gave a complete change in the form and scale of production and gave birth to a new economic system
 shreniyan, jinka rup ab bhi madhyakaalin tha, apane aapako nayaa rup na de sakin
 Their utility ended
 parinamswaroop unka ant bhi ho gaya

 He had a close friendship with the famous revolutionary Ram Prasad 'bismil'
 krantikari kaaryon ke liye ve inkaa moujar praaia: maang kar le jaaya karte the
 Not only this, sometimes they used to buy cartridges on their license as and when required
 kakori kand main prayukt moujar pistaul ke kaartoos inhen ke shastr-license par kharide gayi the jiske paryaapt sakshya mil jane ke kaaran inhen 5 varsh kii kathor kaid kii sajaabhugatani paddy thi
 kakori-kand prosecuted for 2 years, so spent a total of 7 years in prison from 1925 to 1932
 chhootakar aaye to aaajeevan avivaahit rahakar desh-seva kaa vrath le liya
 Was a member of the Executive of Congress for 40 years
 congress ke tikat par kai varsh loksabhaa ke saansad bhi rahe
 On 3 August 1993, he died in the district hospital of Shahjahanpur when only six months were left to complete his century
 bade hi jeevat ke vyakti the
 In West Punjab, which now moved to Pakistan, Dr
 Harnarayan Khanna was a civil surgeon, his son Ramakrishna Khanna was the Chief Divisional Engineer in the British Indian Railways, headquartered in the historic city of Shahjahanpur in the then United Provinces Agra and Awadh
 british sarkaar ne unhen rhibahadur kii oopaadhi pradaan kii thi
 An infant was born on 2 February 1894 from his wife's womb, named Premkrishna
 us samay ramakrishna khanna lahore main tainaat the or punjab main railway ke vistaar kaa kaam dekh rahe the
 Son Premkrishna was more interested in reading the biographies of revolutionaries and news of Viplavi movements since childhood, his mind was less often in school education, so when he grew up, the father gave him a good impression from the British government
 He got the contractor's work done in the construction company so that his livelihood can be managed permanently and his marriage is a good family sushi Could be today
 premakrishna khanna ke pitaaji rhibahadur ramakrishna khanna jab shahjahanpur aa gayi unhone kachhari railway phatak ke sameep ek aaleeshaan kothi banavaa di jahaan rahakar sthaayee rup se thekedaari kaa kaam kiya ja sake
 Since contract work is risky, his father asked the government to get his son a license to keep a pistol for his personal safety
 premakrishna ne us license par apane liye ek moujar pistaul kharid liya
 Before the Mainpuri conspiracy, Ram Prasad Bismil used to search for such people who have arms and have license to keep arms
 kyonki krantikari kaaryon main shastr or goli barood kii aavashyaktaa rahati hi he at: khojate-khojate unhen premakrishna khanna kaa pataa mil gaya
 He also included Khanna ji in "shahjahanpur Seva Samiti"
 yah 1917 kii baat he
 Khanna ji was so impressed by Bismil's fiery personality that he became an automatic follower of his ideals and orders
 san 1918 main dilli ke congress adhiveshan main shahjahanpur seva samiti ke swayamsevak bhi sammilit hue
 His group leader was Ram Prasad 'bismil'
 us samay tak you0pi0 sarkaar dwaara 1916 main jabt "america kii swatantrata kaa itihaas" kii saamagree sankalit karke ek anya pustak taiyaar kii ja chuki thi-"america kaise swadhin hua?" premakrishna khanna va shahjahanpur ke anya swayamsevakon ne is pustak kii saikadon pratiyaan congress adhiveshan main chilla-chilla kar bech daaleen
 As soon as the intelligence police got to know about this, Bismil cleverly removed the remaining 200 books from the sale by hiding in an overcoat, otherwise Khannaji along with other volunteers would have been arrested there
 1918 kii dilli congress main khanna ji kii sakriyata dekhakar unhen "indraprastha seva samiti" kaa daayitv saunpa gaya
 Under the supervision of this committee, a grand pandal was constructed in the 1919 Amritsar Congress session
 isaki sajja vyavastha "shahjahanpur seva samiti" ne kii thi, donon hi samitiyon ko vahaan puraskrit kiya gaya
 Seeing the active participation of Khanna in the "non-cooperation Movement" released in 1921 by the "home Rule Service Committee, Delhi", he was made the Minister of the Ward Congress Committee, after which he was appointed as Delhi Territorial Executive Member in Delhi
 us samay unke pitaaji east indian railway howerah divijan ke chif ejeeniyar the kintu parivaar ke anya log shahjahanpur main hi rahete the
 Thus, while living in Delhi and working in Congress, his travel to Shahjahanpur remained equal and kept in touch with revolutionaries like Bismil
 san 1921 ke ahmedabad congress adhiveshan main ramprasad'bismil' ne purna swaraj ke prastaav par moulana hasarat mohani kaa khulkar samarthan kiya or antatogatva gandhi ji se purna swaraj ke liye asahyog aandolan prarambh karne kaa prastaav paarit karvaa kar hi maane
 Due to this he became very popular among the youth
 samooche desh main asahyog aandolan shuru karne main shahjahanpur ke swayamsevakon kii aham bhoomika thi
 Khanna also attended that session but seeing what happened there, he became disillusioned with the Congress
 uske baad san 1922 main jab chaurichaura kand ke pashchaat kisi se paraamarsh kiye bina gandhi ji ne dictatership dikhaate hue asahyog aandolan waapas le liya to 1922 kii gaya congress main khannaji ne va unke saathiyon ne bismil ke saath kandhe se kandha bhidakar gandhi ji kaa aisa virodh kiya ki congress main phir do vichaardhaarayen ban gayin - ek udaaravaadi yaa libral or duusari vidrohi yaa rebelion
 Gandhiji always used to call the rebel ideology youths as protesters in the Congress general meetings
 farvari 1922 chaurichaura kand se ghabaraakar gandhiji ne jab asahyog aandolan waapas le liya to khannaji bhi ram prasad 'bismil' ke netritv main congress party se alag ho gayi or puure desh main "rivolutionari party of india" kaa sanghathan khada karne main tan-man-dhan se jute gayi
 a large number of young men from Shahjahanpur joined the party
 itnaa hi nahin, you0pi0 main bareli se damodar swaroop seth, banaras se manmathanath gupt, rajendra nath lahidi va chandrasekhar aaazaad bhi dal main shaamil ho gayi
 From Shahjahanpur, Ashfaq Ullah Khan and Thakur Roshan Singh came forward to work with them after mixing shoulder to shoulder
 party ke liye shastr jutaney or kaartoos aadi uplabdh karaane main khannaji ne ji-jaan se sahyog kiya
 On 26 September 1925, the search of Khannaji's house was carried out by police sub-inspector Fasahat Hussain, in which a licensee mauser pistol and cartridges were recovered
 police ne asalaah or license sabhi apane kabje main le liye
 On the information of informer Banarsilal, CID Inspector Mr
 Harton checked the register of arms dealer Messrs Vishwas and Company of Kanpur
 register se pataa chalaa ki 14 farvari 1924 se 5 janvari 1925 ke bich premakrishna khanna ne 150 kaartoos kharide
 On a forensic examination of an entry dated 7 August 1924 on the register, it was found that the signature of Premkrishna Khanna was in the handwriting of Ram Prasad 'bismil'
 mukademen main khannaji ko kakori shadyantr main bismil kaa sahyog karne ke liye 5 varsh kii kadi sajaa kaa aadesh nyaayalay dwaara diya gaya
 The police tried to prove that Ramprasad used to learn to shoot with the same pistol of Khanna ji and the cartridges brought in his name were used in the rail robbery
 police ne inhen pathbhrashtha karne kii bahut cheshtha kii parantu sab vyarth siddh hui
 He remained on his path regardless of his father's anger
 chunki bismil ne apni aatmakatha main samast deshavaasiyon se deshhit main keval ek party ke liye kaam karne kaa sandesh diya tha jail se rihaayi ke baad aapane congress aandolan main puure taur se yoga diya
 He struggled throughout his life to remove peasant organization and social anomalies
 congress ke tikat par do baar sansad-sadsy bhi rahe or congress party ko krantikariyon ke lakshya par chalaane ke liye satat prayatnsheel rahe
 Inspired by the thoughts of his close friend and revolutionary movement Pandit Ram Prasad 'bismil', Khanna pledged to remain unmarried for a lifetime and put up half a dozen projects in his district work area, whose names are as follows: uparokt prakalpon ke kriyanvayan main khannaji ko jin mahaan vibhootiyon se shubh kaamanaayen, sahyog va aashirwad mila unamem bharat ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri laal bahadur shastri va indira gandhi uttar pradesh ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri chandrabhanu gupt tathaa sampoornanand evam rajasthan ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri mohanlal sukhadia ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Apart from this, he had also designed two other projects during his lifetime - Kakori Shaheed Degree College Jalalabad and shaheed-azam Pt Ram Prasad 'bismil' Smriti Bhavan and Revolutionary Museum
 iske liye unhone us samay 16 lakh rupee nakad, bahadurganj shahjahanpur kaa talaua kaa maidan, jis par bismil smriti bhawan va krantikari sangrahalay banane kii unki yojana shaamil thi; registerd vasietname ke tahat apni samast chal achal sampatti trust ke naam kar di thi
 Smriti Bhawan and Museum were not built, yes, "prem Kishan Khanna State Degree College" was definitely built in his name in Jalalabad
 shahjahanpur main khirani baag sthit ram prasad 'bismil' kaa janm sthaan aaj bhi kisi vyakti ke paas he
 Neither the Government of Uttar Pradesh nor the Government of India could declare it a national heritage with any effort
 jab dilli ke ballimaran mohalle main mirza gaalib kii haveli kaa punaruddhar va shandaar kayakalp kendra sarkaar kar sakati he to bismil sareekhe krantipurush kaa kyon nahin? He did a great job not only for the Congress but also for the welfare of freedom fighters
 do-do baar uttar pradesh vidhaan sabha tathaa kendriya lok sabha ke sadsy to rahe hi u0pra0 swatantrata sangram senaanee sanghathan evam u0pra0 swatantrata sangram senaanee kalyaan parishad ke adhyaksh pad kaa daayitv bhi ve mrityu paryant nibhaate rahe
 He died on 3 August 1993 at the District Hospital in Shahjahanpur when he was about to score a century in his life
 yadi 6 maheene or jinda rah jate to 2 farvari 1994 ko purnayu kaa saubhaahgya praapt karte

 sahih al-bukaari, jise bukhari shareef bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sunni is one of the Qutb al-sittah of Islam
 in pigambar kii paramparaon, yaa hadison ko muslim vidwaan mohammad al-bukaari ne ekatra kiya
 The collection of this hadith was completed around 846 / 232 Hijri
 sunni musalmaan sahi bukaari or sahi muslim ko do sabase bharosemand sangrah maanate hai
 Zaidi is also considered and used by Shia Muslims as an authentic hadith collection
 kuch samoohon main, ise quran ke baad sabase pramanik pustak mana jaataa he
 The Arabic word "sahih" means authentic or correct
 sahi muslim ke saath sahi al bukhari ko "sahihain" ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 Others Others: According to Ibn al-salah, the actual title of the book, commonly known as the correct al-bukhari, is: "al-jami 'al-sahih al-musnad al-mukhtasar Min Umuri Rasulillahi and Sunnahi and Ayyamhi"
 sheershak kaa ek shabd-se-shabd anuwaad he: paigambar, unke prathaon or unke kaal ke sambandh main jude maamalon ke sambandh main pramanik haddees kaa sangrah
 Ibn Hajar al-asaklani referred to the same title, in which the word Umur was replaced with the word hadith
 al bukhari 16 saal kii umr se abbasid khilaafat main vyapak rup se yatra karte the, un paramparaon ko ikattha karte the jinhen vah bharosemand mana tha
 It is reported that al-bukhari devoted 16 years of his life in collecting about 600,000 mentions in this collection
 bukhari ke sahi main haddees kii sateek sankhya par strot alag-alag hai, is par nirbhar karata he ki haddees ko paigambar parampara kaa varnan mana gaya he yaa nahin
 Experts have, in general, estimated the number of complete-isnad hadiths to 7,397 hadiths, and the number of hadiths of the Prophet is reduced to about 2,602, without repetition or consideration of different versions in the same hadiths
 us samay bukhari ne haddees ke mutaluk pehle ke kaamon ke dekha or unhen parkhaa
 After Ur Puri Chaan Bean collected only those who would be considered as Sahih and Hasan
 or unamem se kai daeef yaa zaeef haddees bhi shaamil hai
 This clearly shows that he had an interest in compiling the hadith and he did it as well
 unke sankalp ko or majboot karne ke liye unke shikshak, haddees vidwaan ishaak ebn ibrahim al-hanthali ne unhen bataaya tha, "ham ishaak ebn raahveh ke saath the, jinhone kaha, 'agar aap keval paigambar ke pramanik kathaon kii ek pustak sankalit karenge
 'this suggestion stayed in my heart, so i started compiling Sahih
 " bukhari ne yah bhi kaha, "maine paigambar ko ek sapane main dekha or aisa lagata tha ki main unke saamne khadaa tha
 i had a fan in my hand that i was protecting them
 maine kuch khwab kii tabir bataane waalon se puchha, to unhon ne mujh se kaha ki "aap unhen jhooth se bachaayenge"
 "this is what had me intent on producing Sahih
 " This book covers almost all aspects of life in providing proper guidance to Islam such as the method of praying and other works of the Ibadat by Prophet Muhammad
 bukhari ne apana kaam 846 / 232 hijri ke aasapaas puraa kar liya, or apane jivan ke aakhri choubees varshon main anya shaharon or vidwaanon kaa daura kiya, unhone jo haddees ekatra kiya tha use padhaayaa
 In every city of Bukhari, thousands of people gather in the main mosque to read these traditions collected from them
 pashchimi shaikshanik sandehon ke jawaab main, jo ki unke naam par maujuud pustak kii vaastavik tithi or lekhak ke rup main he, vidwaan bataate hai ki us samay ke ullekhneey haddees vidwaan ahamed ebn hanabal, yahya ebn mine, or ali ebn al-madini ne inaki pustak kii pramanikta sweekaar kii or sangrah tatkaal prasiddhi hogaya
 It was also famous that after the death of the author, people started considering this book as an amendment and it became a historical record
 choubees varsh kii is avadhi ke dauraan, al bukhari ne apni pustak main maamuli sanshodhan kiye, vishesh rup se adhyay sheershak
 Each version is named by its descriptor
 ebn hajar al- asakalani ke anusaar unki kitaab nukta main, sabhi sanskarnon main haddees kii sankhya samaan he
 The most famous is the version described by al-firabari, a trusted student of Bukhari
 al-khatib al-bagdadi ne apni pustak itihaas baghdad main phirabari ko yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya: "sattar hajaar logon ne mere saath sahahi bukhari ko suna"
 Firabri was not the only spreader of al-bukhari
 ibrahim ebn maqal, hamma ebn shaker, mansoor barduzi or hossain mahamili ne agali pidiyon ko is kitaab ke zariye padhaaya or failaayaa
 There are many books which differed, among which is the most Ahm Fattah al-bari
 ullekhneey islamic vidwaan amin ahsaan islahi ne sahi al bukhari ke teen utkrisht gun soochibaddh kiye hai: Ibn al-salah said: "the first Bukhari to authorize Sahih was Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ismail al-zufi, followed by Abu ibn al-usain Muslim ibn al-anjaz ek-naysaburi al-kushairi, who was his student
 , Used to share the same teacher
 ye do pustaken quran ke baad sabase pramanik kitaaben hai
 As for the statement of al-shafi'i, who said, "I do not know of a book containing knowledge more than the book of Malik," - others mention it with a different word - he said this before the books of Bukhari and Muslim
 bukhari kii kitaab do or adhik upyogi donon ke liye adhik pramanik he
 " ebn hajar al- asaklani ne abu jafar al-ukvilla ko uddhrut karte hue kaha, "bukhari ne sahih likhaa tha, unhone ise ali ebn al-madini, ahamed ebn hanabal, yahya ebn mine ke saath-saath anya logon ko bhi padhaa
 He considered it a good effort and testified to its authenticity with the exception of four hadiths
 al-akvilla ne tab kaha ki bukhari vastav main un chaar haddees ke bare main sahi the
 "ibn Hajar then concluded," and they are truly authentic
 " Ibn al-salah said in his Muqaddimah ibn al-ila'ah fe 'ulam al-adid: "it is told to us that Bukhari has said,' i have not included in the book al-jami 'that which is authentic and i did Other authentic hadiths for the minority are not included
 '" iske alaava, al-dhahabi ne kaha," bukhari ne yah kehete hue suna tha,' maine ek sau hajaar pramanik haddees or do sau hajaar yaad kiye hai jo pramanik se kam hai
 '" mahila netritv ke sambandh main bukhari main kam se kam ek prasiddh haad haddees, isaki saamagree or uske haddees kathakaar ke aadhaar par likhi gayi, jisko kuch lekhakon ne pramanik nahin mana
 Shehadeh uses gender theory to criticize hadiths, while Farooq believes that such hadiths are incompatible for reforming Islam
 effi or efi sharia kaanoon ke liye haddees ke bajaaye samakaleen vyakhya par charchaa karnaa chaahate hai
 Another hadith, mentioned by Abu Hurairah, has been criticized by Fatema Mernissi for being out of context and having no explanation in Bukhari's collection
 imam jarkashi haddees sangrah main hazarat aaisha dwaara suchit haddees main spashtikaran diya gaya he: "


 vah hamaare ghar main aayaa jab paigambar vaakya ke bich main the
 He only heard the end of it
 paigambar ne kya kaha tha: 'allaah yahudiyon ko khaarij kare; ve kehete hai ki teen chijen buree kismat laati hai: ghar, mahila or ghode
 "'in this case the question has been raised as to whether other hadiths in Bukhari have received proper reference notice of incomplete and deficient sahi bukhari paigambar ke dawa or upachaar ke tareeke or hijama jise ashastreey hone kii sambhaavna pesh kii gai he
 Sunni scholar Ibn Hajar al-asaklani, based on archaeological evidence, criticized the hadith, stating that this hadith claims that Adam's height was 60 cubits and that human height has been decreasing since then
 ebn al-salaah ne yah bhi kaha: "haddees kii kitaab, sahih main 7,275 haddees he, jisamen kuch hadisen baar-baar doharaai bhi gayi hai
 It has been said that this number is 2,230, except for repeated hadiths
 " yah un haddees kaa zikr kar rahe hai ho musnad hai, jo mohammad se utpann hokar sahyogiyon dwaara pramanik hai
 One of the most important aspects in Sahih al-bukhari is the name of the Tarjuma al-bab or that chapter
 kai mahaan vidwaanon ne ek aam tareeqa apanaaya; "bukaari kii fiqh unke adhyyon main"
 Many scholars have not commented on the method of this scholar except Hafiz ibn Hajar Asqalani and a few others
 shah valiullah muhadith dehalavi ne abwab yaa adhyyon ke taraazum yaa anuwaad ko samajhane ke liye 14 usul kaa ullekh kiya tha, phir moulana shaikh mahmud hasan ad-devbandi ne ek usul or jod kar 15 usul banaaye
 a study by Shaykhul Hadith Maulana Muhammad Zakaria found 70 usul
 unhone vishesh rup se taraazim sahih al bukhari ke usulon ke bare main apni pustak al-abwab chaat-taraazim fi sahi al-bukaari main likhaa he
 Wrote in sahi al-bukaari kaa anuwaad nau khandon main "sahi al bukhari arabi angreji ke arthon kaa anuwaad" sheershak ke tahat mohammad muhseen khan dwaara angreji main kiya gaya he
 The text used for this work is Fatah al-bari, published in 1959 by the Egyptian press Mustafa al-babi al-halabi

 These abnormalities can be caused by carcinogens or carcinogens such as tobacco smoking, radiation, chemicals, or infectious factors
 Other genetic abnormalities that cause cancer may sometimes be due to an error in DNA cancer replication, or may be inherited genetically and thus present in all cells since birth

 cancer ke 100 se adhik prakaar hai
 The type of cancer is usually named for the organs or tissues where the cancer begins, but they are also known as the type of cells from which they are made
 
 Bladder cancer breast cancer colorectal cancer kidney cancer leukemia cancer cancer karkat ko koshika ke prakaar ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya jaataa he jo gaanth se samanta rakhti he, isiilie, utak ko gaanth se utpann mana ja saktaa he
 These are tissue science and place respectively

 For example, liver cancer is called hepatocarcinoma; Cancer of fat cells is called liposarcoma
 aam canceron ke liye, ang ke angreji naam kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For example, the most common type of breast cancer is ductal carcinoma of the breast or memory ductal carcinoma
 yahan par visheshan dakatal kaa upyog sookshmdarshi main dikhaayi dene vaale us karkat ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he, jo saamaanya stan kii vahiniyon se samanta rakhti hai

 aam taur par, sharir kai vidhiyon ke madhyam se karkat ke khilaaf bachane kii koshish karata he, jaise: apoptosis, sahaayak anu, sambhavtah jeernata aadi
 However these error correction methods often fail in small ways, especially in environments where errors are more likely to occur and increase

 Or periodic injury, or environments in which cells have not developed for their survival, such as hypoxia
 is prakaar se karkat ek pragatisheel rog he or ye pragatisheel trutiyaan dhire dhire koshika main sanchit hoti rahati hai jab tak jantu main upasthit koshika apane kaaryon ke vipareet kaary nahin karne lagati
 Errors that cause constriction are often self-amplifying, eventually increasing at an exponential rate
 udhaaharan ke liye: Thus, the sputum often explodes as a chain reaction due to some errors, these errors combined make more serious errors
 aisi trutiyaan jo adhik trutiyaan utpann karti hai, ve prabhavi rup se karkat kaa mul kaaran hai or saath hi, ye is baat kaa kaaran bhi hai ki karkat kaa upachaar bahut mushkil he: chaahe karkat kii 10,000,000,000 koshikaon main se sab ko maar dene ke baad, unamem se keval 10 koshikaayen apni pratikruti kar sakati hai yaa truti utpann karne vaale sanketon ko anya koshikaon ko bhej sakati hai to prakriya phir se shuru ho jaati he

 Research about the causes of cancer often falls into the following categories: karkat rog janan kaa kaaran he DNA utparivartan jo koshika vruddhi or metastasis ko prabhavit karata he
 The substances that cause DNA mutation are called mutagens and those mutations that cause cancer are called carcinogens
 kai vishesh prakaar ke padaarth vishisht prakaar ke vikshepse jude hue hai
 Tobacco smoking is associated with many forms of cancer, and is the cause of 90% of lung cancers
 lambe samay tak esbestus fibre ke sampark main rahane se mizothelioma ho saktaa he
 Many mutagens are also carcinogens, but some carcinogens are not mutagens
 alcohol ek rasinic carcinogen kaa udhaaharan he jo utparivartajan nahin he
 Such chemicals promote cancer by stimulating the rate of cell division
 pratikruti kii tej dar anzimon kii marammat ke liye kam samay detii he jisase DNA pratikruti ke dauraan kshatigrast DNA kii marammat ke liye paryaapt samay nahin mil pataa he, jiske kaaran ek utparivartan kii sambhaavna bad jaati he

 Sources of ionizing radiation, such as radon gas, can cause cancer
 surya ke parabangnee vikiran ke lambey samay tak sampark main rahane se melanoma or anya twachaa durdamataayen ho sakati hai
 Non-ionizing frequency radiations emanating from mobile phones and other sources have also been considered to cause cancer, but there is little evidence of such a relationship
 phir bhi kuch visheshgy ehtiyaati siddhant ke aadhaar par lambe samay tak ansi chizon ke sampark main rahane se bachane kii salaah dete hai
 Some cancer can be caused by infection with the pathogen
 kai cancer ek virus ke sankraman ke kaaran hote hai; yah vishesh rup se jantuon jaise pakshiyon main dekha jaataa he, lekin manushyon main bhi aisa hota he, puri duniya main 15% maanav cancer ke liye virus hi jimmedaar hai
 The main viruses related to human cancer are human papilloma virus, hepatitis b and hepatitis c virus, epstein-barr virus and human T-lymphotropic virus

 Conversely, in a slowly mutating virus, the virus genome inserts into the genome of the host near a proto-oncogene
 ab viral pravartak yaa anya pratilekhan viniman tatv us proto-onkosin kii ati-abhivyakti kaa kaaran banate hai
 It involves uncontrolled cell division
 kyonki pravishti kaa sthaan proto-onkosin ke liye vishisht nahin hota he or kisi bhi proto-onkosin ke paas pravishti kii sambhaavna kam hoti he, dhimi gati se roopantarit hone vaale virus, tivrata se roopantarit hone vaale virus kii tulana main, sankraman ke adhik lambe samay ke baad gaanth paidaa karte hai
