 subramanyam swami kaa aarope he ki gandhi parivaar herald kii sampattiyon kaa avaidh dhang se upyog kar rahaa he jisamen dilli kaa herald house or anya sampattiyaan shaamil hai

 Since then, the order has been served
 subrahmanyam swami ne court main arji daakhil kar aarope lagaaya tha ki sonia gandhi or rahul gandhi ne congress party se lone dene ke naam par neshnal herald kii do hajaar karod rupee kii sampatti jabt kar lee
 Congress first loaned Rs 90 crore to National Herald's company Associate Journals Limited on 26 February 2011
 iske baad paanch lakh rupee se yang india company banaai, jisamen sonia or rahul kii 38-38 pratishat hissedari he
 The remaining stake is held by Congress leaders Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes
 iske baad ke 10-10 rupee ke nau karod share yang india ko de die gaye or iske badale yang india ko congress kaa rin chukaana tha

 The judge said in the 27-page order that after considering the entire case in its systematic perspective, the court had no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the petitioners were able to gain control over 'associated Generals Limited' through 'young India Limited'
 The methodology adopted by, while the core people of the Congress Party, AJL and YIL are the same, gives evidence of criminal intent
 nyaayadhish ne kaha ki baharhaal, kisi bhi surat main yah nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki sambandhit shikaayat ke aaropee ke taur par yachikakartaon ko talab karne ke liye koi maamla nahin banataa
 The questionable conduct of the petitioners to know the truth needs to be properly investigated at the stage of the charge and hence these criminal proceedings cannot be revoked at this initial stage

 In respiration, the volume of carbon dioxide that exits and the amount of oxygen absorbed is called the respiratory quotient
 yah sadaiv sankhya main nirupit kiya jaataa he jaise- 6CO2 / 6O2 = 1shwasan bhagfal se is baat kaa sanket miltaa he ki shwasan kii kriya main kis prakaar ke khadyapadaarth kaa upchayan ho rahaa he, kyonki yah anupaat vibhinn khadyapadaarthon ke upchayan main vibhinn hota he
 Its value is greater than the unit, less than the unit, depending on the foods used in respiration
 jab shwasan kii kriya main upachayit honevaala khadyapadaarth carbohydrate hota he tab shwasan bhagfal kaa maan ikai hota he, jaise ankurit genhun ke bijon main
 When the food substance used in respiration is fat or protein, the value of the respiratory quotient is less than one unit
 2C51H98O6 + 145O2 → 102CO2 + 98H2O + urja Respiratory coefficient values can range from 0
4 to 0
9 when a food substance is used in respiration
 yadi hamen RQ kaa maan gyaat ho to is baat kaa anumaan laga sakate hai ki shwasan kii kriya main kis prakaar ke khadyapadaarth kaa upchayan ho rahaa he
 In the process of photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the presence of light and release oxygen gases into the atmosphere

 Isopanishad Shukla is a Upanishad under the Yajurvedic branch
 yah upanishad apane nanhen kalevar ke kaaran anya upanishdon ke bich behad mahatvapurn sthaan rakhata he
 There is no story in it, only self-description

’’ se lekar atharahawein shloke ‘‘agne nay suptha raye asman vidhwani dev vaunani vidvan


’’ tak shabd-shabd main maanon brahm-varnan, upasna, prarthana aadi zankrut he
 There is only one voice - of Brahman, of knowledge, of self-knowledge
 adbhut kalevar vaale is upanishad main ishwar ke sarvanirmaataa hone kii baat he saare brahmad ke maalik ko ingit kiya gaya he, satvik jeevanstyli kii baat kahi gai he ki duusare ke dhan par drushti mat daalo
 While living in this world, we have been told to live lifelessly
 isamen ‘asurya’ naamak lok kii baat aati he — asurya matlab ki surya se rahit lok
 The world where the sun cannot reach, the ultimate world filled with thick, dark darkness, that is, the womb
 kaha gaya he ki jo log aatm ko, apane ‘swa’ ko nahin pahachaanate hai, aatma ko jhuthla dete hai, nakaar dete hai or isi asweekaar tale puraa jivan bitaate hai unhen mrityu ke pashchaat usee andhtam lok yani ki asurya naamak lok main janaa padataa he arthath garbhavas karnaa padataa he, phir se janm lenaa padataa he
 Thus in this Upanishad, on the one hand, considering God as the Creator, on the other hand, indicates to live life by becoming a mere instrument, which on the other hand indicates not to forget self
 iske baad aatm ko nirupit karne kaa tathy aata he ki ‘vah’ achal he saath hi man se bhi zyada tivrgami he
 This self is a fast escape from all senses
 is upanishad main aatm / brahm ko 'maatarijva' naam se ingit kiya gaya he, jo ki sabhi kaaryakalapon ko vahan karne vaala, unhen sambal dene vaala he
 In order to describe the qualities of Brahma of 'atma', it is here that he is simultaneously, at the same time, wandering, as well as intransitive
 vah paas he or dur bhi
 Here he is indicated by several speeches - that he is omnipotent, bodiless, omniscient, self-born and the ruler of the mind
 is upanishad main vidya evam avidya donon kii baat kii gai he unke alag-alag kism ke gunon ko bataaya gaya he saath hi vidya evam avidya donon kii upasna ko varjit kiya gaya he — yahan yah saaf-saaf kaha gaya he ki vidya evam avidya donon kii upasna karne vaale ghaney andhkaar main jaakar girte hai saakaar kii prakruti kii upasna ko bhi yahan varjit mana gaya he lekin haan vidya evam avidya ko ek saath jaan lene vaala, avidya ko samajhakar vidya dwaara anushthanit hokar mrityu ko paar kar letaa he, vah mrityu ko jitkar amritatv kaa upbhog karata he yah sweekaarokti yahan he
 In this, considering both goodness and perishable, it is said that the attainment of indestructible element and consumption of nectar is said
 is upanishad ke antim shlokon main bade hi sundar upmaan aate hai — brahm ke mukh ko suvarna paatr se tanke hone kii baat saath hi surya se poshan karne vaale se prarthana kii
 Stitching from the suvarnapatra, the face of that self should be exposed so that the worshiper can understand, feel that the Kavah itself is Brahmarupa and all the deeds performed in the last verses come to be remembered by the mind and pray to Agni Once the physical body is transformed into ashes, it will orient it towards the ultimate destination from the divine path

 charvak darshan ek bhautikwaadi naastik darshan he
 It accepts only direct evidence and does not accept this doctrine from the hereafter
 yah darshan vedabaahya bhi kaha jaataa he
 The Vedabya philosophies are six - Charvaka, Madhyamika, Yogachara, Sautrantika, Vaibhashika, and Arhat
 in sabhi main veda se asammat siddhanton kaa pratipaadan he
 Ajit Keshakambali is credited as the precursor of Charvaka, while Jupiter is commonly referred to as the founder of Charvaka or Lokayat philosophy
 charvak, brihaspati sutara ke adhikansh praathmik sahitya gaayab yaa kho gaye hai
 Its teachings have been compiled from historical secondary literature such as the scriptures, sutras, and in Indian epic poetry and from the dialogues and Jain literature of Gautama Buddha
 charvak pracheen bharat ke ek anishvaravaadi or naastik taarkik the
 They are believed to be the disciples of Jupiter, the originator of the atheist
 brihaspati or charvak kab hue iskaa kuch bhi pataa nahin he
 Jupiter is considered by Chanakya in his Arthashastra book to be one of the principal teachers of economics
 charvak kaa naam sunate hi aapako ‘yada jivet sukhan jivet, rin kruthva, ghrutan pivet’ kii yaad aegi
 ‘charvak’ naam ko hi ghrinaaspad gaali kii tarah badal diya gaya he
 It was as if the borrowers, the philanthropists and the fallen people were the only ones who followed this theory
 prachlit dharna yahi he ki charvak shabd kii utpati ‘chaaru’+’vaak’ se hui he
 It is evident that this nomenclature has been made by those opponents of this theory who believed that these people seduced innocent people with sweet things
 charvak siddhanton ke liye buddha pitakon tak main ‘lokayat’ shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he jiskaa matlab ‘darshan kii vah pranali he jo jo is lok main vishwaas karti he or swarg, narak athwa mukti kii avadharana main vishwaas nahin rakhti’
 charvak yaa lokayat darshan kaa zikr to mahabharat main bhi miltaa he lekin iskaa koi bhi mul granth uplabdh nahin
 Apparently, as it spoke against the ruling forces of its time, its texts were destroyed and in the popular narrative, the Charvakas were introduced as villains
 sarvadarshansangrah main charvak kaa mat diya hua miltaa he
 It is written in Padmapurana that Jupiter had expressed Vedaviruddha opinion to seduce Asuras
 naastik mat ke sambadh main vishnupurana main likhaa he ki jab dharmabal se daitya bahut prabal hue tab devataaon ne vishnu ke yahan pukaar kii
 Vishnu produced a man named Mayamoh from his body who went on the banks of the Narmada in the form of Digambar and seduced the Asuras and corrupted them in the Dharmargava
 mayamoh ne asuron ko jo upadesh kiya vah sarvadarshansangrah main die hue charvak mat ke shlokon se bilkul miltaa he
 Like, - Mayamoh has said that if the animal killed in the yagna goes to heaven then why does not Yajaman kill his father, etc
 lingapurana main tripuravinaash ke prasang main bhi shivaprerit ek digambar muni dwaara asuron ke isi prakaar bahakaae jane kii katha likhi he jiskaa lakshya jainon par jaan padataa he
 In the Valmiki Ramayana Ayodhya scandal, Maharishi Javali's preaching to Ramachandra to leave Banabas and return to Ayodhya is also found in the opinion of Charvak
 in sab baton se siddh hota he ki naastik mat bahut pracheen he
 It should be understood at the same time that the excess of Vedic rituals had started knocking some people
 charvak ishwar or paralok nahin maanate
 His philosophy is also called Lokayat because of not obeying the hereafter
 sarvadarshansangrah main charvak ke mat se sukh hi is jivan kaa pradhan lakshya he
 There is also sorrow in the world, realizing that those who do not want to enjoy happiness are fools
 machhlee main kaante hote hai to kya isse koi machhlee hi na khaay ? choupaae khet par jaayange, is dar se kya koi khet hi na bove ? ityadi
 Charvaks do not consider the soul as a separate substance
 unke mat se jis prakaar gud, tandul aadi ke sanyog se madh main maadakta utpann ho jaati he usee prakaar prithvi, jal, tej or vaayu in chaar bhuton ke sanyogvishesh se chetanta utpann ho jaati he
 By their analysis or destruction, 'I' means consciousness is also destroyed
 is chetan sharir ke naam ke peeche phir punaragaman aadi nahin hota
 God, otherworldly subjects etc
 are based on conjecture
 par charvak pratyaksh ko chhodkar anumaan ko pramaan main nahin lete
 He argues that inference is dependent on prevalence
 jo gyaan hamen baahar indriyon ke dwaara hota he use bhoot or bhavishya tak badhaakar le jane kaa naam vyaptigyaan he, jo asambhav he
 This knowledge is visible in the mind, it is not a proof because the mind is dependent on the senses for its experience
 yadi kaho ki anumaan ke dwaara vyaptigyaan hota he to itaretarashray dosha aata he, kyonki vyaptigyaan ko lekar hi to anumaan ko siddh kiya chaahate ho
 The idea of charvak should be seen in Sarvadarsanasangraha, sarvadarshanasiromani and jupitersutra
 naishadh ke 17wein sarg main bhi is mat kaa vistrut ullekh he
 Charvak only supports pragmatism, he does not follow the presumptions etc
 uske mat se prithvi jal tej or vaayu ye chaar hi tatv he, jinase sab kuch bana he
 In his opinion, the sky is not the position of the element, it is a body formed by the combination of these four elements, only a special type of combination of them creates consciousness in the body, which people call a soul
 sharir jab vinasht ho jaataa he, to chaitanya bhi khatm ho jaataa he
 In this way, the organism originates from these ghosts and ends as soon as these ghosts are destroyed, it has no importance back and forth
 isaliye jo chetan main deh dikhaai detii he vahi aatma kaa rup he, deh se atirikt aatma hone kaa koi pramaan hi nahin miltaa he
 By the opinion of Charvak, women are called sons and their relatives and the happiness given by them is called happiness
 unka aalingan karnaa hi purusharth he, sansar main khaanaa pinaa or sukh se rahanaa chaiye
 It has been said in this philosophy that: - arth he ki jab tak jeena chaiye sukh se jeena chaiye, agar apane paas saadhan nahin he, to duusare se udhaar lekar mouj karnaa chaiye, shamshaan main sharir ke jalane ke baad sharir ko kisne waapas aate dekha he? According to Charvaka philosophy, these four elements earth, water, light and air are the root causes of creation
 jis prakaar buddha usee prakaar charvak kaa bhi mat he ki akaash naamak koi tatva nahin he
 This is just zero
 apni aanvik avasthaa se sthool avasthaa main aane par uparyukt chaar tatva hi bahya jagat, indriya athwa deh ke rup main drusht hote hai
 Their proof system is the reason behind not obeying the objective power of the sky
 jis prakaar ham gandh, ras, rup or sparsh kaa pratyaksh anubhav karte hue unke samavayiyon kaa bhi tattat indriyon ke dwaara pratyaksh karte hai
 The sky element is not the same
 at: unke mat main akaash naamak tatva he hi nahin
 What is the reason for the four elements? Charvakas do not have the answer to this question
 yah vishwa akasmaat bhinn-bhinn roopon evam bhinn-bhinn matraaon main milane vaale chaar mahabhuton kaa sangrah yaa sanghatt maatr he
 According to the Charvakas, there is no other substance called the Atma from the four mahabhutas
 chaitanya aatma kaa gun he
 Since there is no such thing as a soul, therefore the virtue or religion of the conscious body is proved
 arthath yah sharir hi aatma he
 There are three types of its accomplishment - logic, experience and Ayurveda scripture
 tark se aatma kii siddhi ke liye charvak log kehete hai ki sharir ke rahane par chaitanya rahata he or sharir ke na rahane par chaitanya nahin rahata
 With this unknown contrast, the body itself proves to be the basis of consciousness
 anubhav 'main sthool hoon', 'main durbal hoon', 'main gora hoon', 'main niskriy hoon' ityadi anubhav hamen pag-pag par hota he
 Physical weakness etc
 are the religions of the body and 'I' is also the same
 at: sharir hi aatma he
 In Ayurveda, mixing of good, barley, mahua, etc
 in order of chronological order makes the mixture strong, or a mixture of curd, yellow clay and cow dung produces a scorpion or in betel leaf, catechu, betel nut and lime
 Redness in the mouth is produced by mixing them even if there is no red color, in the same way Chaitanya is produced by the specific combination of quadrilaterals
 kintu in bhuton ke vishisht maatra main mishran kaa kaaran kya he? is prashn kaa uttar charvak ke paas swabhaavvaad ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 In the scriptures of God, justice etc
, God is proved by the presumption or objection
 chunki charvak pratyaksh or keval pratyaksh pramaan ko maanata he at: uske mat main pratyaksh drishyman raja hi ishwar hai vah apane rajya kaa tathaa usamen rahane vaali praja kaa niyanta hota he
 Therefore, he should be considered as God
 prameya arthath vishay kaa yatharth gyaan arthath prama ke liye pramaan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Charvac folk consider only direct evidence
 vishay tathaa indriya ke sannikarsh se utpann gyaan pratyaksh gyaan kehalaata he
 The world theorem is directly visible through our senses
 iske atirikt anya padaarth asat he
 Through the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin, the word Gandh Rasa and touch are directly visible to all of us
 jo vastu anubhavgamya nahin hoti uske liye kisi anya pramaan kii aavashyaktaa bhi nahin hoti
 Buddhists, Jainism, non-vedic philosophy and nyaya-vedic, etc
 also consider semi-vedic philosophy inference as proof
 unka kahana he ki samast prameya padaarthon kii satta keval pratyaksh pramaan se siddh nahin kii ja sakati
 But Charvak states that only possibility can be created by inference
 nishchayatmak gyaan pratyaksh se hi hota hai
 Seeing the remote green lush trees, listening to the cacophony of the birds there, we consider the possibility of water there due to the cool breeze from there
 jal kii uplabdhi vahaan jaakar pratyaksh dekhne se hi nishchit hoti he
 Therefore, to generate possibility and to conduct public behavior, inference is necessary but it cannot be proof
 jis vyapti ke aadhaar par anumaan pramaan kii satta maani jaati he vah vyapti ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 It is the nature of fire with dhoom and the smell of smell with flowers
 sukh or dharm kaa du:kha or adharm kaa kaaryakaaran bhav swaabhaavik he
 Just like the sweetness in the word of Kokil and the consternation in the word of crows, it should be understood everywhere
 jahaan tak shabd pramaan kii baat he to vah to ek prakaar se pratyaksh pramaan hi he
 The words of the aggrieved person are directly told to us
 unako sunne se arth gyaan hota he
 This is obvious
 jahaan tak vedon kaa prashn he unke vaakya adrusht or ashrutapurna vishyon kaa varnan karte hai at: unki vishwasaneeyata sandigdh he
 At the same time, Vedas prove their inhumanity by doing disgusting things like Ashwagalagrahna in unrighteousness etc
 and committing abominable acts like eating meat and using meaningless words like Jarbhari Turfari
 uparyukt vivaran se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki charvak log is pratyaksh drishyman deh or jagat ke atirikt kisi anya padaarth ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Those people who consider Purusharthchatashta, called religion, meaning, work and salvation, are considered useful for men, ie human body
 unki drushti main arth or kaam hi param purusharth he
 It is foolish to believe in an object called religion because when there is no other heaven etc
 apart from this world, it is unrestrained to enjoy the fruit of religion in heaven
 pakhand dhurtton ke dwaara kapolkalpit swarg kaa sukh bhogane ke liye yahan yajna aadi karnaa dharm nahin he balki usamen kii jane vaali pashu hinsa aadi ke kaaran vah adharm hi he tathaa havan aadi karnaa tattd vastuon kaa durupyog tathaa vyarth sharir ko ksht dena he isaliye jo kaary sharir ko sukh pahunchaaye usee ko karnaa chaiye
 In which there is satisfaction of the senses, the mind should rejoice
 jinase indriyon kii tripti ho man anandit ho unheen vishyon kaa seven karnaa chaiye
 Religion is not to remove, not kill, kill those elements which are obstructing the senses of the body
 shaareerik maansik ksht sahanaa, vishayanand se man or sharir ko balaat virat karnaa adharm he
 This means that the believer in Vedic and even semi-vedic philosophies, following the ethos described in the Puranas, if the body is a seeker of happiness, they should follow it and if they are obstructed by it, they should be discarded forever
 charvaakon kii moksh kii kalpana bhi unke tatva mimasaa evam gyaan mimasaa ke prabhaav se purna prabhavit he
 As long as there is a body, a man suffers from various kinds of suffering
 yahi narak he
 Freedom from this suffering group is attained when the body becomes conscious, that is, it dies
 yah maranaa hi moksh he kyonki mrit sharir ko kisi bhi ksht kaa anubhav mar jaataa he
 It is salvation to die because the dead body does not experience any suffering
 yadhyapi anya darshanon main aatma ke astitv ko sweekaar karte hue usee ke mukt hone kii charchaa kii gayi he or moksh kaa swaroop bhinn-bhinn darshanon main bhinn-bhinn he, tathaapi charvak unki manyata ko prashray nahin dete
 He neither considers salvation as eternal, neither considers it to be true and chit form, nor does he accept salvation as his position in Sachchidanand form
 charvak darshan vah darshan he jo jan saamaanya main swabhaavat: priy he
 The philosophy whose sentences are charu means interesting is the Charvak philosophy
 sabhi shastreey gambheer vishyon kaa vyaavhaarik evam loukik purv paksh hi charvak darshan he
 Everything we do in the natural form is the basis of the Charvak philosophy
 charvak darshan jivan ke har paksh ko sahaj drushti se dekhtaa he
 This simple vision towards life is Charvak philosophy
 vaastaviktaa to yah he ki, vishwa kaa har maanav jo jivan jeeta he vah charvak darshan hi he
 Such sentences and principles which will be pleasing to everyone, will be a rectangle or special in the world
 sambhavat: yahi kaaran he ki ham charvak darshan ko lokayat darshan ke naam se bhi jaanate hai
 This philosophy is also famous among scholars known as Barhaspatya philosophy
 is naam se yah prathit hota he ki yah darshan brihaspati ke dwaara virachit he
 Brihaspati is recognized as the guru of the gods in Indian society
 parantu bhartiya sahitya main brihaspati ek nahin hai
 It is a very difficult task to decide who is the originator of Charvak philosophy, Jupiter
 anigaras evam loukya rup main do brihaspatiyon kaa samullekh rugveda main praapt hota he
 According to Ashwaghosha, Arghus is the prophet of Jupiter's philosophy
 loukya brihaspati ke mat main sat padaarth kii utpatti asat se maani jaati he
 Similarly, the origin of discrete matter has been assumed from the truth
 jad padaarthon ko hi asat kaha jaataa he
 Conscious substances are called Satas according to this belief
 ek brihaspati kaa nirdesh mahabharat ke van parv main bhi praapt hota he
 This Jupiter takes the form of Venus, to conserve Indra and to destroy the demons, to create anatomism or prapancha science
 is prapanch vigyaan ke falswaroop shubh ko ashubh evam ashubh ko shubh maanate hue daanav veda evam shastron kii aalochana evam ninda main sanlagn ho jate hai
 In another context, there is a description of another Jupiter in the Mahabharata itself, who, together with Shukracharya, composed the discourse
 vibhinn shastron ke aacharyon kii maane to charvak mat darshan kii shrenee main nahin mana ja saktaa kyonki is darshan main maatr madhur vachanon kii aad main vanchanaa kaa hi kaary kiya gaya he
 It is another matter that if he listens to Charvak, he also declares various scholars to be deceptive
 ek aise brihaspati kaa taittareey brahman granth main varnan miltaa he jo gayatri devi ke mastak par aghat karata he gayatri devi ko padam puraana ke anusaar samast vedon kaa mul mana gaya he
 From this point of view it can be considered as the antagonist of Jupiter Veda
 sambhavat: veda kaa virodh prati pad karne ke kaaran is brihaspati ko charvak darshan kaa praneta bhi mana janaa yuktiyukt hoga
 The theme of Jupiter is also found in Vishnu Purana
 brihaspati kii is manyata ke anusaar vaidic karmkand bahuvitt ke vyay evam prayaas se saadhy he
 These Vedic remedies for the seekers of diverse pleasures are the law of some self-centered selfishness
 taarkik brihaspati kaa bhi kahin kahin varnan miltaa he
 They are the followers of the Jupiter Veda, but only support rational rituals
 inaki drushti se tatva nirnay shaastra par aadhaarit avashya hona chahie parantu yah shastreey anusandhan tark poshit hona nitant aavashyak he
 Argumentless thinking can never be meaningful in determining religion
 vatsyayan muni ne apane vishwa prasiddh granth kamasutra main arthshaastra ke rachayita ke rup main brihaspati kaa ullekh kiya he
 According to a formula of economics written by Jupiter, only Lokayata has been recognized as a scripture
 falat: arthshaastra ke praneta brihaspati evam lokayat shaastra ke pravarttak main antar kar paanaa atyant duruh kaary he
 Some critics have considered Jupiter to be the creator of Kamasutra as well as the creator of economics and the creator of Lokayata Shastra
 yadi loukik ichchhaaon ko purna karnaa hi charvak darshan kaa uddeshy he to kaamshaastra ke pravarttak muni vatsyayan hi brihaspati hai, yah maananaa upyukt hi he
 Kautilya has given a comfortable rendering of Lokayat philosophy in economics
 is prakaar arthshaastra ke rachanaakaar kautilya evam lokayat darshan ke praneta brihaspati ek hi hai aisa mana ja saktaa he
 According to the treasurer Hemachandra, the author of Economics, Kamasutra, nyasutra-bhasya, Panchatantra and Chanakya Policy is the same
 itani vivechna ke baad jo brihaspati vaidic vaaiumay main vibhinn prasangon main charchit hai unke yatha kram naam is prakaar spasht hote hai
 In the context of Padma Purana, Angira is the psyche son of Brahma
 angiras brihaspati angira ke putr evam brahma ke pautra hai
 As a result, they are counted among the gods
 is prakaar dev guru brihaspati evam angiras brihaspati main koi bhed nahin mana ja saktaa
 For the preservation of the gods, the preaching of the devas to the asuras by the Guru of the gods has been implied in various worlds, this statement cannot be reliable in the context of Dev Guru Brihaspati
 asur apane guru shukracharya ke rahete devguru ke upadesh ko kyon aadar denge? at: devguru se atirikt koi charvak darshan kaa pravarttak hona apekshit he
 Some critics have categorically acknowledged that Jupiter, the master of Charvaka, the master of heaven Indra, the master of heaven, is not a world-renowned Jupiter
 ye brihaspati kisi rajkul ke guru hai
 From the historical point of view, if Vashistha, Vishwamitra, Dronacharya, etc
, being the master of any Rajkula, is also giving the basis for this belief
 jis prakaar aastik darshanon main shankar darshan shiromani ke rup main sweekrut he usee prakaar naastik darshanon main sabase utkrisht naastik ke rup main shiromani kii tarah charvak darshan kii pratishtha nirvivaad he
 Atheist Shiromani Charwak is also believed to have rejected the supernatural sovereign power of God recognized in one form or another on the basis of faith in the world
 inke matanusaar ishwar naam kii koi vastu sansar main nahin he
 The atheist Shiromani Charwak, who is visible from some external senses, feels the same, accepts his power
 yahi kaaran he ki charvak ke siddhanth main pratyaksh pramaan ko chhod kar koi doosraa pramaan nahin mana gaya he
 The power of the God who has been conceived in other philosophies is not possible through direct evidence
 inke mat se beej se jo ankur kaa pradurbhaav hota he usamen ishwar kii bhoomika ko maananaa anaavashyak evam uphasaaspad hi he
 The origin of sprout is proven to be a natural and natural process of survival by the combination of soil and water
 is swabhaavik kaary ko sampann karne ke liye kisi adrusht kartta kii sweekruti nirarthak he
 If you do not believe in God, how will it be possible to arrange the results of good and inauspicious deeds of living beings? Solving this question, Charvak asks, which system of karma fruit is required? Two types of karma are seen in the world
 ek loukik tathaa doosraa alokik karm
 Are you concerned about the arrangement of the fruits of cosmic actions? If yes, then this concern is unnecessary
 loukik karmon kaa fal vidhaan to lok main sarv maanya raja yaa prashaasak hi karata he
 This proven fact is obvious
 ham dekhte hai ki chaurya karm aadi nishiddh kaary karne vaale ko uske dushkarm kaa samuchit fal, lok siddh raja hi dand ke rup main karagaar aadi main bhej kar detaa he
 In the same way, a person who performs auspicious actions like protecting one's life, etc
, in the form of a reward, the king confirms it with a good means of wealth and honor
 yadi aap alokik karmon ke fal kii vyavastha ke sandarbh main sachint hai to yah chintaa bhi nahin kerani chahie
 Because all these Yajna, Puja, recitation, penance etc
 prescribed in terms of parlokik fruits have been conceived by some rogues with a view to cheating the common man and to maintain their livelihood and stomach
 vastav main agnihotra, teen veda, tridand kaa dhaaran tathaa sharir main jagah jagah bhasma kaa sanlep buddhi evam purusharth hinata ke hi parichaayak hai
 No one has lost sight of these Vedic deeds till date
 yadi vaidic karmon kaa koi fal hota to avashya kisi na kisi ko iskaa pratyaksh aaj tak hua hota
 Therefore, till date no one has the direct experience of these Vedic or Varnashrama-system-related deeds - heaven, salvation, devaloka gaan etc
, so all these Vedic deeds are unfruitful, it is proved to be automatic
 yahan yadi aastik darshan yah kahe ki paralok swarg aadi ko siddh karne vaala vyapaar adrusht yaa dharm evam adharm he jisase swarg kii siddhi hoti he to yah charvak ko sweekaarya nahin he
 Rejecting the supernatural, the Charvak abrogates the role of the unseen in the means of heaven and heaven and thus destroys the core of the believer's philosophy
 yahi kaaran he ki adrusht ke aadhaar par siddh hone vaale swarg aadi paralok ke nirasan ke saath hi is adrusht ke niamak yaa vyavasthaapak ke rup main ishwar kaa bhi niraas charvak mat main anayas hi ho jaataa he
 In Charvak, no living being is different from the body
 sharir hi jeev yaa aatma he
 As a result, when the destruction of the body takes place after the cremation after death, then the creature or soul also perishes
 sharir main jo chaar yaa paanch mahabhuton kaa samavdhaan he, yah samavdhaan hi chaitanya kaa kaaran he
 This belief that this creature goes beyond death after death, it is proved unfounded by accepting the body as conscious or soul
 shastron main paribhaashit moksh rup param purusharth bhi charvak nahin sweekaar karata he
 Salvation of the conscious body is salvation in this opinion
 dharm evam adharm ke na hone se charvak siddhanth main dharm-adharm yaa punya-paap ko, koi adrishy swarg evam narak aadi fal bhi nahin he yah anayas hi siddh ho jaataa he
 In Charvak, how can the sensation of the sensation of the child in childhood be remembered in old age or youth when the body is considered a soul? This is a burning question that arises easily
 yahan yah nahin kaha ja saktaa ki baalyavastha kaa sharir, vriddhavastha kaa sharir evam yuvavastha kaa sharir ek hi he
 If the body of the three states were the same, then there would not be such a big difference between the bodies of these three states
 antar se yah spasht siddh hota he ki sharir ke avyav jo maance pind aadi hai inamen vruddhi evam hraas hota he
 And it is only due to these degradation and growth that destruction of the body of childhood and creation of the body of youth is proved
 yadi yah kahen ki yuvavastha ke sharir main yah vahi sharir he, yah vyavhaar hone ke kaaran sharir ko ek maan kar uparyukt samaran ko utpann kiya ja saktaa he, to yah kathan bhi yuktiyukt nahin ho saktaa
 Because this is the same body, this affirmation is due to the similarity of form and shape
 falat: donon avasthaaon ke shariron ko abhinn nahin mana ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, in order to fulfill the memory of the pre-seen childhood period, the birth rites in the body of the Charvak Balakala create new rites like the ones in the body of other youth
 isi prakaar yuvavastha ke sharir main vidyaman sanskaar vriddhavastha ke sharir main apane jaise sanskaar utpann kar dete hai
 The etavata is recollected in the Charvak School without any hindrance from the address of these childhood rites
 antat: charvak darshan main sharir hi aatma he yah sahaj hi siddh hota he
 If the body itself is a soul, then Charvak can be asked that 'mama body' this is my body, how will such a popular behavior be generated? By this behavior it seems that the body is different and the master of the body is someone else, who is a separate soul from the body
 is prashn kaa samaadhaan karte hue charvak kahata he ki jaise daanav vishesh ke sir ko hi raahu kaha gaya he, phir bhi jan-saamaanya 'raahu kaa sir' yah vyavhaar bade hi sahaj rup main karata he, usee prakaar sharir ke hi aatma hone par bhi 'meraa sharir' yah loksiddh vyavhaar uppann ho jaayegaa
 In the Charvakas, the objection of remembrance cannot be dispelled if the senses are destroyed by considering some of the Charvak senses as a soul
 kinhin charvaakon ne praan evam man ko bhi aatma ke rup main mana he
 To prove that the body is a soul, Charvak also presents the context of this Veda for the satisfaction of the believers
 is veda vachan kaa taatpary he ki 'vigyaan se yukt aatma in bhuton se utpann ho kar ant main in bhuton main hi villin ho jaataa he
 It is the merger of the soul with the body in the ghosts and death
 ' Winds that flow continuously throughout the year in both spheres from equatorial low air pressure lattices to regions of southern latitude, ie subtropical high air pressure lanes, are called commercial winds
 ye pawan varsh bhar ek hi disha main nirantar bahati hai
 Normally, this wind should flow from north to south in the northern hemisphere and from south to north in the south hemisphere, but due to Ferrell's law and Corollis force it is deflected to its right in the northern hemisphere and to its left in the south hemisphere
 She goes

 These are called 'trade winds' in English
 yahaan ‘trade’ shabd german bhashaa se liya gaya he, jiskaa taatpary nirdisht path yaa maarg se he
 It is clear that these winds flow in the same direction on a specified path annually
 uttari golardh main ye hawaaen uttar-purv se dakshin-pashchim kii ore bahati hai, vahiin dakshini golardh main inaki disha dakshin-purv se uttar-pashchim kii ore hoti he
 Due to the continuous flow in the regular direction, in ancient times, these winds helped the merchants in the operation of the sailing vessels, due to which they came to be known as the commercial wind

 And this lettering is derived from Persian lettering

 This Islamic alphabet was developed by well-versed people in writing the Quran, which became part of the Islamic culture

 Before paper was made, this art was displayed on skins, on canvas, on clothes

 Later Arabic letters turned 29
 yah style, iraq ke shahar kufa main janmi or 7veen shatabdi main pragati paayi
 This style became known as Kufi or Kufic style due to the name of this city
 yah style aage chal kar kai rup main likhi jane lagi jaise, pushpiya, naqushi, chotidaar, border rup, or chatursreey rup kii style ityadi
 These styles were used in writing copies of the "quran" during the 8th to 10th centuries
 baad main 11veen shatabdi main saadhaaran lipi kii tarah bhi upyogit rahi
 This style began to be used for decorating as well
 kufi style ke upyog keliye koi khaas sutara nahin hai; ek hi sutara yaa tareeqa he ki iske aksharon ko koniya rup main likh jaye
 There was no specific way or formula to write this, because this style started being used in other ways in other countries

 Simple forms of this style: and "ali" style which is written in Chatursriya form is called "bannai"

 The style used in Europe for the decoration of inscriptions is an imitation of the Kufi used in the Middle Ages and the cultural revival
 pataa nahin chalaa ki is style ke upyog ke kaaran kya hai
 It also appears that this style used by Westerners in the 13th and 14th centuries was of Christu's life, an illusion
 ghaseet kar likhi jane vaali lipi bhi is kufi style ke saath upyog main thi
 But there were no static formulas in this style in the initial stage, so it was used as an informal purpose

 Four touching stories of the "cradle house" operated at Vatsalya Village, Vrindavan for the ceremonial upbringing of destitute newborns under the auspicious guidance of "pujya Didi Maa Sadhvi Ritambhara Ji", the spiritual power of the world xxrep 4 
 ' Little Rudraksha has been suffering from a serious heart disease called 'reverse pumping' since her birth, due to which the functioning of the chamber in her heart is completely opposite to that of a normal heart
 jis chember dwaara oxyzan kii aapurti fefdon ko honi chahie vah uske bajaay sharir ke anya bhaagon main chali jaati he
 Poojya didi left her mother's shelter in 2014 as soon as her mother gave birth due to the inability to get treatment
 is rog se use mukti dilaane ke liye usee samay okhla, dilli ke ‘fortis ascort hospital’ main rudraksh kii surgery kii gai
 Operation Dr
 According to Rajesh Sharma, in his efforts to correct this complex anomaly of the chamber process in the heart of the child, his team did a deep research and found that even after this operation, by the age of 21, Rudraksha had many more operations
 He will be able to recover
 pehla aaparishan varsh 2014 main hua or lagaataar das dinon tak chali gahan chikitsakeey nigaraanee ke baad vah vatsalya gram, vrundavan lautaa
 In May 2016, she underwent her second 'open heart' surgery at JP Hospital in Noida
 lagaataar 11 ghanton tak chalaa yah aaparishan atyaadhik jatil tha
 Since there is a need to separate the heart from the body and hand it over to the machine, there is also a crisis on the patient's life
 11 ghanton ke us lambey aaparishan se jujhate hue rudraksh ko ‘post aaparishan care’ ke antargat agle paanch dinon tak ‘heart-langs mashin’ par rakhaa gaya, kyonki gahari thakaan ke kaaran uskaa hriday thik se kaam nahin kar paa rahaa tha
 He was also given 14 units of blood due to excessive bleeding during the operation
 sukhad sanyog yah rahaa ki ventilator hataae jane ke baad uske hriday ne apana kaam karnaa shuru kar diya
 i still remember that night a few years ago, in the fierce cold of January 2, when a man or woman went to the cradle house of Vatsalya village around ten o'clock, keeping a newborn child
 soochna milane par jab ham log vahaan pahunche to use dekhakar dang rah gaye
 a beautiful child was very neatly wrapped in woolen clothes and someone was kept there
 tamaam saamaajik kuritiyon ke chalate hamaare desh main ek arase se navjaat kanya ko maar die jane athwa sadakon par marane ke liye chhod jane kii pashavik ghatnaayen to ghatati aa rahi hai, lekin itane sundar se balak ko koi kaise chhod saktaa he! yah ek bada achraj tha
 The next day, according to a certain procedure, in the 'pushpanjali Crosley Hospital' in Ghaziabad, a medical examination of the child revealed a serious heart disease whose treatment cost was estimated at lakhs of rupees
 sambhawatah apni bahut kamjor aarthik haalat ke chalate hi kisi maan ne apane kaleje par pathar rakhkar use vatsalya gram ke paalna ghar main choda hoga taaki uski jindagi batch sake
 Amidst the untiring efforts of the medical team of the hospital, the life of that little child continued to light
 jiske bachane kii bhi sambhaavnaaen ksheen thim, lekin didi maan ji kii vatsalyamayi god ne usamen navajivan phunk diya
 Today he is growing up laughing and playing
 vatsalya gram, vrundavan ke ‘paalna ghar’ or tatkaaleen ‘pushpanjali kraasale hospital’ ke sevaabhaavi chikitsakon ne badi khamoshi ke saath apane ahernish prayatnon ke bich aise anekon bacchon ke jivan bachaa liye, jo maut ke muhane tak pahunch chuke the
 Radha was also one of them
 vatsalya mandir, jwaala nagar, dilli kii shrimati niraj goyal apni yaadon main jaakar bataati hai ki -‘pushpanjali hospital kii gahan chikitsa ikai main jivan rakshak pranali par jivan-mrityu se sangharsh karti nanheen si radha ke wo bees din bhulaae nahin bhoolatey
 In November 2013, Radha, a minor member of the Vatsalya family, after suffering from shortness of breath, underwent medical examination and found her suffering from pneumonia which was in critical condition
 fefdon ke sankraman ke baad uskaa ek aaparishan bhi kiya gaya
 After which she was in a 'coma' condition on the ventilator for twenty days
 ek acchhee-khaasi or hansati-khelti nanheen bacchee yun achaanak gahari behoshee main chali jaaegi, iskaa andaja kisi ko bhi nahin tha
 Every day, every moment everyone would wait for his eyes to open, but there was no movement in his body, except for his slow breath
 hospital kii puri medical team sari sambhaavnaaon ke maddenzar uske ilaaj main juty hui thi
 Everybody used to pray to God and ask for blessings from her sister
 allopathy ke saath hi use homeopathic davaayen bhi di gayi
 His concerted efforts to save his life, which included both medicine and blessings, were ultimately successful
 vatsalya parivaar khushi se jhum uthe jab radha ne apni nanheen aankhe kholkar phir se duniya ko dekha
 Summer of 2014
 vatsalya gram, vrundavan ke karyaalay main soochna mili ki ek dampatti sanstha ke prashaskeey vibhaag se sampark karnaa chaahate hai or unke saath ek nanheen navjaat bacchee bhi he
 Usually visitors who visit Vatsalya Village, Vrindavan first come to the reception and office, then we thought that they would be interested in a general courtesy visit
 unhen bheetar bulaayaa gaya
 Entering the room, they both looked out of place
 unhone bataaya ki ve ek kisaan parivaar se hai
 On asking further, the young man's wife cried and said, "we have come here to leave our little newborn girl
" ’ hamen yah jaanakar aashcharya hua ki madhyamvargeey kisaan parivaar ke us yuvak kii aarthik sthiti itani bhi kharaab nahin thi ki vah us bacchee ko na paal sake
 On expressing curiosity, the woman elaborated that - 'I have a daughter even before this, at the time of my birth, my in-laws' people gave me a lot of taunts
 ve betaa chaahate the or meraa beti ko janm dena unke liye kshtakaari tha
 It did not seem that anyone was happy except my husband, at his birth
 uske baad jab main phir se garbhvatee hui to putr janm kii chaah liye, mere sasuraal waalon ne mujh par bhrun ke ling pareekshan kaa dabaav banaaya
 Knowing that having sex test of the fetus is a punishable offense, when i got this test done under the pressure of my father-in-law, i came to know that i have a daughter again in my womb
 yah pataa chalate hi parivaar main jaise koharaam sa much gaya
 Immediately efforts started to force me to get an abortion
 lekin main apane is nirnay par adig thi ki main kisi bhi sthiti main apane garbhasth bhrun kii hatya nahin hone duungi
 In the midst of all the attempts by my family to abort the female fetus, i gave birth to that second girl
 jin virodhon ke bich maine use janm diya tha unke chalate use paalna itnaa kathin ho chalaa, jisaki maine kabhi kalpana bhi nahin kii thi
 There were attempts to stop me from breastfeeding her
 vah bhukhi-pyaasi navjaat bacchee bilakh-bilkhakar roti or mujhe kisi aise kaam main ulajhaa diya jaataa, jiske kaaran main uske paas tak pahunch hi na sakun
 The five-day-old girl was already weak because during my pregnancy i was not able to get nutritious food, even normal food was not given properly
 puri koshishen is baat ko dhyaan main rakhkar kii gayi ki kaise bhi vah bacchee mere garbh main dam tod de
 But she was born because of my will power
 das-baarah dinon ke baad jab use bukhaar aayaa, tab mujhe use doctor ke paas le jane tak se roak diya gaya
 Now i started to feel that my in-laws would take the life of this girl
 maine is disha main sochna shuru kiya ki bhale hi yah bacchee mere paas na rahe, lekin iskaa jivit rahanaa bahut jaruri he
 In the midst of this thought, i realized that there is a Vatsalya village of Sister Mother Sadhvi Ritambhara in Vrindavan
 kyon na is bacchee ko unki sharan main chhod aayaa jaae
 If she is raising so many children, then this moment will also accompany them
 kam se kam isaki jaan to bachegi
 Considering this, both of us husband and wife have come here from the house quietly and want to leave this girl in Vatsalya village
 is ghatana kaa varnan karte hue kalam us maan ke dard ko likh paane main asamarth thi, jisane us maan ko antim baar apni ladli beti ko stan paan karaate hue dekha tha
 Despite having the ability to raise the child, separating her from herself, the threat of that mother's bursting heart was shaking the hearts of all the people present there
 vah baar-baar us bacchee ko gale se lagaati
 Words cannot express the mother's clamor while separating a girl who is suffering from fever forever
 is drishy ke sakshi log us maan kii sankalp shakti ke aage natmastak the, jisane jane kitne dabaavon ke baavjood bhi na keval us bacchee ko janm diya balki uski jindagi ko bachaane ke liye anek sangharshon ke bich vah vatsalya gram tak ja pahaunchi thi
 The Vatsalya family was grateful for the resolve of a forced mother who was going to be a part of Didi Ma Ji's 'beti Bachao Andolan'
 us maan kaa dard dekhakar sabaki ankhen bhari hui thim
 Vatsalya Gram had seen this scene for the first time when a mother was leaving her mother in front of everyone in the cradle of Vatsalya
 rah-rahakar man-mastishkon main yah vichaar uthta rahaa ki kitna nishthur hota he manushya! devi jaisi abha liye us sundar, sukomal bacchee ko dekhakar ham sab logon ke dil dahal uthe ki kaise koi vyakti apni is navjaat potee ko maar daalane par amada ho saktaa he! aam taur par is prakaar ke bacchon ko log vatsalya gram ke paalna ghar main gopneey rup se chhod jate hai lekin yah maamla alag tarah kaa tha, jisamen bacchee ke mata-pita swayan prastut hokar apni vivashtaa ke saath bacchee ko saunpna chaahate the isliye is sambandh main unki likhit sahmati ke saath us bacchee ko vatsalya gram ne sweekaar kar liya
 After so many years, that girl today is like everyone else in the entire Vatsalya family

 This religious city, blessed with the smell of Shri Krishna, still has its own charm
 yahan mandiron kii bahutayat or tang galiyon ke madhya ab bhi logon ke hryday main shrikrishna vidyaman hai
 But in this city itself a new pilgrimage has arisen and if we do not visit Vrindavan then it should be understood that the journey remained incomplete
 This modern pilgrimage is settled by the famous Sadhvi Ritambhara in the name of Didi Maa
 vrindavan shahar se kuch baahar vatsalya gram ke naam se prasiddh yah sthaan apane aap main anek patakathaon kaa kendra ban saktaa he kisi bhi samvedansheel saahitiyik abhiruchi ke vyakti ke liye
 is prakalp ke mukhyadwar ke nikat yashoda or baalkrishna kii ek pratimaa vatsalya ras ko saakaar rup pradaan karti he
 In fact, the idea behind this unique project is to replace the orphanage's professionalism and senselessness with the society's desire to present a model that will save India's family tradition and create cremated boys and girls, rather than inferiority complex
 Spreading emotions and forcing them to leave their tradition and culture
 samaaj main didi maan ke naam se khyath sadhvi ritambhra ne is parisar main hi bhare-puure pariwaron kii kalpana saakaar kii he
 An middle-aged or elderly woman is called a nanny, a young woman is part of the same family called a aunt and has two infants
 yah parivaar ikai parisar main rahakar bhi puri tarah swytt hoti he
 Aunt and maternal grandmother leave their home and give this project all the time and this family of Vatsalya village is their family
 iske atirikt vatsalya gram ne desh ke pramukh shaharon main helpline suvidha main de rakhi he jisase aise kisi bhi navjaat shishu ko jise kisi karanvash janm ke baad besahaara chhod diya gaya ho use vatsalya gram ke swayamsevak apane sangrakshan main lekar vrindavan pahunchaa dete hai
 Didi's mother also showed a girl who was thrown into a trash can in Delhi in a newborn condition and dogs ate some part of her brain
 aaj vah balika swasth he or chaar varsh kii ho gai he
 Didi Maa has given shelter to so many such babies, but they are being brought up not in the environment of selflessness but in the family environment
 yahi moulikta vatsalya gram ko anathalayon kii kalpana se alag karti he
 Didi ma, the first thought that came to my mind after seeing this project brought about the pervasiveness of Hindutva and its multi-faceted nature
 ye vahi sadhvi ritambhra hai jinaki singh garjana ne 1989-90 ke shriram mandir aandolan ko urja pradaan kii thi, parantu usee aakraamak sinhani ke bheetar vatsalya se paripurna stri kaa hryday bhi he jo saamaajik samvednaa ke liye dravit hota he
 This is the basis of the heart of Hindutva, that the heart of Hindutva is to resist the injustice and preserve the sensations
 Perhaps those who curse Hindutva day and night or who wish to make Hindus impotent in the name of the vastness of Hindutva, cannot understand this depth of Hindutva
