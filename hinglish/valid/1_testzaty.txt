yadi smriti hamaare mastishk main rahati he to iske bhautik nirupan ke kuch pramaan bhi hone chahie
 a lot of research has been done in this direction and many interpretations have also been presented in its context
 yah to aarambh se hi maaloom tha ki smriti nirmaan ke liye jaivik anu hi jimmedaar hote hai
 The first attempt was made in the 1960s to explain it based on the derivation of DNA molecules
 yah bataaya gaya ki smriti ke jaivik nirupan ke liye mrna ke anu jimmedaar hote hai
 It is noteworthy that these mrna molecules are mainly related to our genome messages and protein formation
 baad ke varshon main yah dekha gaya ki smriti ke bhautik aadhaar kii yah pariklpana sahi nahin he or is kshetra main koi bhi vichaar prastut karne ke liye nae avishkaron kii aavashyaktaa he
 The 1970s saw some new ideas regarding the physical representation of memory
 yah bataaya gaya ki mastishk main smriti ksheen vidyutiya tarango ke rup main utpann hoti he or yah kisi tarah se mastishk kii rachana main ati sookshm str par sthai bhautik parivartan karti he
 This physical change represents a new memory
 is vyakhya ke bare main ullekhneey hoga ki yah vibhinn prayogtmak parikshanon par aadhaarit thi or sahi bhi thi
 But here it could not explain how and what the weak electrical waves change structurally
 ” haal ke varshon main hue shodhon se smriti jauviki ke sambandh main nai jaankariyaan mili hai
 According to them, two major factors in memory formation are neural chemistry and nerve cell synapses
 shodhon se is baat ke sanket milte hai ki do tantrika koshikaon main soochna sanvahan ke liye jimmedaar neurotransmeter jo ki synapse dwaara sravit hote he ve kisi vishesh smriti ke liye ek vishesh tantrika praaroop ko baar-baar uttejit karte hai
 As a result a pattern is formed
 anubhavon or baar-baar kiye gaye prayaason se is pattern main thodaa parivartan ho saktaa he
 This pattern is permanent for a particular memory
 duusare shabdon main kahen to hamaare prayek anubhavon, kala, kaushal, smriti aadi ke liye nishchit tantrika praaroop hote hai
 When we think of someone, the format related to it is working
 jab ham koi prashn hal kar rahe hote hai to koi doosraa praaroop sakriy hota he
 We all must have faced a situation at some point when we remember our memory
 udhaaharan ke liye ham kuch kehane ja rahe hon or achaanak hi bhul gaye ki kya kahana he yaa pariksha main prashnptr ke saare uttar aa rahe hon lekin unako likhane ke liye shabd nahin mil paa rahe hai
 These are small examples of memory omission
 duusari ore aapane dekha hoga ki vriddhavastha main kuch logon ko bhuulane kii shikaayat hone lagati he
 There is a story about Einstein that once while he was walking in his university, one of his students asked him for lunch
 ainstine ne usase poocha ki jab aapane mujhe roka tab main kis disha kii ore se aa rahaa tha? vidhyaarthee ne ek ore ishaara kar ke bataaya ki aap us disha kii ore se aa rahe the
 Then Einstein replied
 dhanyavad! tab to maine bhojan kar liya he
 Many such stories are told in relation to philosophers and scientists
 yah chote str par hue smriti lop kaa ek udhaaharan he
 In all of the above events, we see that the smooth functioning of our brain is being hindered from somewhere
 thodi bahut maatra main smriti sambandhi dosha to lagbhag sabhi main hota he lekin ise rog kaa naam nahin diya ja saktaa
 When these symptoms affect the person and the people associated with them, then they give it the name of mementoes
 is prakaar ke rogi keval aadhe ghante pehle mili logon ko yaad nahin rakh pate
 He does not even remember that he had taken bath ten minutes ago
 jivan kii saamaanya kriyaayein bahut hi buree tarah se prabhavit hone lagati hai
 Memory omission or memory corruption is a memory event in which any process related to it is interrupted in memory or storage and as a result our normal memory is affected
 yah baadha kisi bhi shaareerik yaa manovaigyanik kaarnon jaise mastishk kii chot yaa kisi anya kaaran se hui kshati, bimaari, poshak tatwon kii kami, sadamein, atyadhik sharaab ke seven se, nashili dawaaiyon or adhik umr ke kaaran ho sakati he
 Some of the main types of amnesia are described here
 sharaab kaa atyaadhik seven karne vaale logon main iske lakshan dekhne ko milte hai
 Long-term high intake of alcohol causes mainly two problems
 ek to thymin vitamin kii khatarnaak str par kami ho jaati he or duusari, mastishk main kuch hanikaarak sanrachanaatmak parivartan ho jate hai
 As a result of this, memory of patients is badly affected
 aisa dekha gaya he ki inaki vartmaankaal kii smriti to thik hoti he lekin beeti ghatnaon ko yaad nahin rakh pate or bahut si mahatvapurn yaaden inaki smriti se puri tarah se gaayab dikhaai detii hai
 This type of memory error makes it difficult to remember new information, but the memories of the past events are exactly right
 aise udhaaharan dekhne ko milte hai ki kisi ke mastishk ke kisi khaas hisse par chot lag gai ho or uske baad use keval puraani bate yaad rah gai hon or durghatana ke baad kii kisi nai smriti ke liye koi sthaan hi na bachaa ho
 Old symptoms are surprisingly forgotten in its symptoms, but there is no problem in memories related to new events
 aise udhaaharan dekhne ko milte hai ki kisi durghatana ke baad puraani sari yaaden pataa nahin kahaan chali gayi? lekin nai soochnaaon ko yaad rakhane main koi kathinaayee nahin ho rahi he
 In this type of amnesia, memory returns in a few days
 yah dekha gaya he ki kabhi kabhi hamaara man hamen kuch vishesh smritiyon to bhuulane ke liye bhi prerit karata he
 And we also forget them completely
 hamaare vartmaan ko sukhad banane ke liye prakruti dwaara aisi vyavastha kii gai he
 This is especially so in the context of very painful memories
 udhaaharan ke liye balykaal main hui koi dukhad ghatana, dand aadi
 It will be noted here that these memories are lost only by our conscious mind
 kahin gahare achetan main inke ansh vidyaman hote hai
 We see many people around us whose memory capacity is very good
 kuch log aise bhi hote hai jo ki apane bhulakkad swabhaav ke kaaran jane jate hai
 All of us think how good it is when our memory capacity increases
 ek acchhee yaadasht kaa mukhya lakshan he ki yah sabhi sambandhit baton ko krambaddh rup se vyavasthit kare or aavashyaktaa padane par turant hi inaki uplabdhta sunishchit kare
 There are some medicines available which help in severe forgetting
 lekin in dawaaiyon kaa prayog vishesh sthitiyon main hi karnaa chahie
 How well we remember and learn depends a lot on our emotional state
 seekhney or samajhane ke liye preranadayak vaataavaran hameshaa hi laabhprad hota he
 We still learn better when we pay attention
 yah bhi aavashyak he ki soochna ko kis prakaar code kiya ja rahaa he
 How its storage and consolidation is happening and how it is being recalled again
 ek acchhee smriti ke liye in sari kriyaaon kaa sucharu rup se hona aavashyak he
 Memory devices are practical methods by which memory capacity can be increased to an extent
 ham jane anjaane main kinhin chizon ko yaad karne ke liye inkaa prayog bhi karte hai
 It is said of Napoleon that he remembered the name of every officer in his army
 is tarah kii vilakshan smriti kshamta vaale log dikhaai dete hai jinhen bahut saare varshon kaa panchang yaad rahata he
 Now the question arises that what is the difference between the way a normal person remembers and the ways of a specific memory person? Research has shown that the method of codification, collection and recall of information may vary slightly among individuals
 ek acchhee smriti yaa to janmajaat pratibha ho sakati he yaa baad main saadhaaran logon dwaara bhi kuch vishesh vidhiyon kaa prayog kar ke sikhi ja sakati he
 The process of memory is slightly complex in people with a congenital high memory capacity
 aisa dekha gaya he ki aise logon me kuch ke paas sinesthesia ke lakshan bhi hote hai
 To explain synesthesia, it can be said that such people listen to the sound as well as listen to the visuals as well
 atah kuch dekhne ke liye ve mastishk kii drishy kshamta ke saath-saath shravan kshamta kaa bhi prayog kar sakate hai
 For example, a soft mellow sound can also be a group of beautiful colors for them and darker piercing colors for a harsh sound
 sinesthesia ke lakshan or bhi samvedi kshamtaaon jaise sparsh, ghran ityadi ke liye bhi ho sakate hai
 Many other memory devices are also used to make memory effective
 jaise pehle se sangrahit smriti ko nai soochna se jod kar yaad karnaa, samaan soochnaaon ko ek saath rakh kar yaad karnaa, kisi bhi soochna ko ruchikar katha ke rup main badal kar yaad karnaa ityadi
 Another method SQ3R is very useful for understanding complex textual content
 isamen pehle paathya saamagree kaa man main ek khaakaa taiyaar karte hai, phir khud se hi us par “kya, kyon or kaise” aadhaarit kuch prashn banaate hai
 Now keeping these questions in mind, the textual content is read carefully and then read it again in sequence
 ant main pathak dwaara isaki samiksha kii jaati he
 Good mental and physical health is essential for good memory
 iske saath hi jo padhaa ja rahaa he usase bhaavnaatmak lagaav bhi aavashyak he
 Some concentration enhancing methods such as meditation and pranayama etc
 have also proved very useful in increasing the capacity of memory

 Shatrughan had two sons named Chota Subahu

 inke anusaar is nagar main dev naamak ek dhanimani seth rahata tha jisaki deva naamak sundar putree thi
 During his father's lifetime, Ashok was appointed the governor of Ujjayini
 patliputra se is nagar ko jate samay vah vidisha main ruk gaya thaan deva ke rup evam gunon se vah prabhavit ho uthaa or usase usne vivaah kar liya

 a second capital was also established there to look after the western parts of the empire

 It is the same Agnimitra who is the protagonist of Kalidasa's play called 'malavikagnimitram'

 His son Vasumitra was sent to the banks of the Indus River to fight with the Yavanas

 vah vaishnav matavalambi tha or is stambh kaa nirmaan usee ne karaayaa tha
 This article is very important from a cultural point of view
 yah is baat kaa parichaayak he ki videshiyon ne bhi bhartiya dharm or samskruti ko apana liya tha
 People from other parts must have come to Vidisha in a similar way
 is dharmakendra main apane aadhyatmik laabh ke liye logon ne smarakon kaa nirmaan kiya hoga

 1924 main mastishk aghat se unka nidhan ho gaya
 Woodrow Wilson would not have even dreamed that he would one day become President of the United States
 bahut kam aise log hai jo is pad par raajnneetik aparipakvatapurna vyaktitv se pahunche honge
 But after becoming President no one would have acted with as much perseverance, prudence, nation-building efficiency and duty-devotion as Wilson, the Messiah of Peace
 ek bhavishyadrushtataa or adarshavaadi hote hue bhi vah linkan ke baad sabase acha adhik yathartwaadee or nipun raajnneetik netaa tha
 But no one knew in 1913 that Wilson would become a great man
 koi nahin jaanata tha ki wilson dwaara sanyukt rajya america ko pratham vishwayuddh main bhaag na lene ke sabhi prayatnon ke baavjood bhi us raashtra ko yuddh main nirnaayak bhaag lenaa hoga
 Nobody knew that he would go beyond the Atlantic to try to give permanent peace to the world, and his efforts would be destroyed at the altar of selfishness and domestic petty opposition by some European politicians
 kisi america raashtrapati ne apane hi aadarshon evam yojanaon ko apane hi logon dwaara nirdayatapurvak nirast evam parajeet hote hue nahin dekha hoga
 Wilson was a professor of political science
 atev vah chintak tha
 He wrote extensive texts on American administration
 uskaa vichaar tha ki karypalika evam vyavasthapika main shakti ke bantwaare se shashan main saamanjasy nahin ho paaya
 Therefore, he wished that the American President should be as powerful as the Prime Minister of England
 jab vah raashtrapati bana to usne nihsandeh apane vichaaron ko karyanvit kar raashtrapati kii shashan kaa shaktishaalee kendra-bindu banaaya
 There was bold boldness in it, a senseless sincerity
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki satvik kaaryon kii sadaiv vijay hogi or satya ke pratinidhiyon ko asaty, avivek evam aadambar se samjhauta nahin karnaa chaiye
 In the early years of his reign, he attracted the attention of the entire public
 usne sampoorn rashtriya jivan main samarpan, tyaag evam naitikta kii bhaavana ko prerit kiya
 But he became so proud of himself for his sattvikta and purposes that he started thinking that those who opposed him were opposing God

 In his election campaign, he gave the slogan of Progressivism, abandoning the conservative views of the past

 He was idealistic
 jab duusari baar vah raashtrapati chunaa gaya tab use is baat kii gambheer chintaa thi ki vishwa kii tanaavpurn sthiti ko dekhte hue america ko tatasthta ke paaydaan par nahin rakhaa ja saktaa tha
 Wilson was an advocate of peace
 vah acchhee tarah jaanata tha ki vishwa yuddh main america pradesh se amarikiyon kii vichaardhaara, darshan evam sahitya par yupriyata kaa baari prabhaav padegaa
 Wilson presented the American proposals for peace, which were rejected by the European powers
 america ne tatasthta kii ghoshnaa kii
 On 4 September 1914, in his diplomatic reference to the Congress, Wilson said- "this situation is not created by us but it is in front of us
" yah hamen pratyaksh rup se prabhavit karti he maano ham un paristhitiyon ke bhagidaar hai jinhone ise janm diya he
 We will pay for it even though we have not intentionally given birth to it
 “ america mahayuddh se achoota nahin rah saktaa tha phir bhi 1914 main koi america nahin jaanata tha ki unhen yuddh main sanlagn hona padegaa
 When Germany's u-boats started an uncontrolled war, America, the last powerful neutral country against Germany, entered the war

 " shantipriy wilson vivash tha
 It was a matter of great importance for America's future that he had found such a person as President who transformed the basis of this war into a 'noun of salvation and reform'
 17 janvari 1917 ke bhaashan kaa ek ansh uski sampoorn maanavtaa ke prati samvedansheel vichaaron ko abhivyakt karata he-”bina kisi paksh kii vijay ke shaanti, prayek jati ke liye aatm-nirnay kaa siddhanth, samuhik, swatantrata, astr-shastron kaa parisemen, uljhane vaali sandhiyon kaa unmoolan tathaa akraman kii roak ke liye samuhik sangrakshan kii vyavastha

 ”is mahaan shantipurna janata ko yuddh kii ore-jo sabase adhik bhayanak or vidhvansak yuddh he
 
taking is a terrible thing

 For democracy, for the rights of the people who believe in the rule that they should be heard in their own government, for the rights and freedom of the small nations, for the rule of the world by the organizations that bring peace to all nations and Provide security and finally the world can become independent
 aise hi lok kaary ko apana jivan or apana sarvasv samarpit kar sakate hai
 With the campaign that the day has come, America's placenta blood and power should be spent for the principles that have given her birth and peace, which she has protected, that is, if God is pleased Can't do anything else
 “ After the war, whether Wilson had suffered defeat and whether it was bitterly criticized by nominal realists, his speech was a turning point in American history and politics
 unke hriday se nikalne vaale shabd itane maarmik the ki sara raashtra uski aawaaj par taanaashaahee par prajatantra kii barbarta par sabhyataa kii vijay ke liye yuddh main kud padaa
 In the countries across the seas, he not only appeared as a unique great man, but also came to be recognized as the leader of a powerful nation, who descended to protect a peaceful, pleasant and orderly life in the world

 Immediately worked to fulfill this promise
 iske purv kii kisi sarkaar ne yuddh main isse adhik budhimaani ore kaaryakshmata nahin dikhalaai thi
 Even before this, the Americans did not show such vigor, resourcefulness and invented intelligence
 “ ‘bina vijay kii shanti’ yuddh kaa naaraa ban gaya tha
 After the cease-fire treaty, Wilson, who did not listen to the advice of his secretary, reached the Paris Peace Conference in December 1918, he was welcomed as the 'messiah of Peace'
 europe main us samay yah bhaavana vidyaman thi ki keval wilson hi aisa vyakti he jo vibhinn rashtron ke raag-dwesh or unki irshyaa-bhaavana se upar uthaa hua evam maanavtaa kaa rakshak he
 Therefore, when this philosopher king took the booklet of his principles in his hand, armed with military power, came to set the terms of the treaty, the people of Europe opened his heart in his honor
 sabhi deshon main uskaa abhootpurv swaagat hua
 When he reached Paris, the French were delighted to see him

 In fact, everyone's eyes were on him
 vijayi nyaay kii, vijit dayaa kii or saamaanya jan-shakti kii aashaa karte the
 Wilson came to this conference as a lamp of peace
 vah nahin chahta tha ki paris sammelan 1815 ke vienna congress jaise nihit swaarthon kaa garh ban jaye
 But he could not guess that the conquering nations had a vestige of selfishness and if he had taken into account other facts, he would have escaped the trap or deception in which he himself got badly entangled due to his idealism
 uske pavitra uddeshy vijeta rashtron kii satta-pipaasa ke aage bhasmasaat ho gayi
 Wilson presented his ideas as the famous 14 sutras
 uske 14 sutron main pratham sutara yahi tha ki shaanti ke samjhaute saarvajanik rup se kiye jaayengen, koi gupt samjhauta nahin hoga
 These principles were also appreciated by the politicians of the Allies

 The conference was also dominated by nationalist ideas, personal interests, which were predominant in the Vienna Congress
 france kaa klemency or england kaa loyad donon ne hi wilson par apni hathvadita ko thopane main safalataa praapt kii
 RB Mobat wrote in 'european Diplomacy' that "clemenceau used to repeat this sentence in the morning - i will support the establishment of the League of Nations"
 “ kintu italy ke orlando se jab ek baar poocha gaya ki rashtrasang ke bare main aapkaa kya mat he to uttar diya tha ki ”ham nihsandeh rashtrasang kii sthapana kaa swaagat karenge kintu fum kaa prashn tay kiya janaa chaiye

 In the words of Stanard Baker, "whoever saw him working, never dared to dare to blasphemy before Wilson or behind his back
" “ wilson kaa yah vishwaas tha ki rashtrasang kii sthapana se hi maanav jati kii raksha ho sakati he, atah vah ise sab shaanti-sandhiyon kaa anivaary ang bananaa chahta tha
 But he was not mentally as sharp as Lloyd George and Clemenceau and relied exclusively on his pre-determined ideas, so he proved to be a novice in the field of diplomacy and political bargaining
 uske adarshavaad or rashtrasang kii sthapana ke atyadhik utsaah kaa duusare deshon ne puraa laabh uthaaya
 For other nations to accept the creation of the League of Nations, Wilson was willing to give up everything, even for the League of Nations he agreed to disregard many of the principles of his 14 sources

 The Chinese state should have been found by the Chinese people on the basis of Wilson's theory of self-determination, but Wilson decided to give it to Japan with the desire to get the support of other superpowers to establish the League of Nations

 Nevertheless, if a little leniency was dealt to the defeated at the Paris Conference, it was because of Wilson
 isamen koi sandeh nahin tha ki yadi wilson sammelan main na hota to loyad jorge or klemenso na jane kya se kya kar dete
 Wilson continued to curb his infinite aspirations
 yadi wilson na hota to france germany kaa namonishaan mitaakar hi dam letaa
 Wilson had two objectives
 pratham nyaaypurna samjhauta jiske anusaar aatm-nirnay ke siddhanth par rashtron kii simaaon kaa nirdhaaran ho taaki paraspar shaanti sthapit ho sake
 Second, the establishment of the League of Nations
 pehle uddeshy main vah safal nahin hua kyonki jo shaanti kii gai vah thopi hui shaanti thi na ki aatm-nirnay ke aadhaar par yaa samjhauta-vaarta kii shaanti
 But he succeeded in the second objective
 rashtron ke sangh kaa vichaar moulik nahin tha or kai deshon main kai logon ne is vichaar ko spasht karne main yogadan diya tha, kintu jis rashtrasang kii antim rup se sthapana kii gai thi vah wilson kii hi sristi thi or uske aadarshon kaa mandir tha
 Some scholars think that Wilson himself made a huge mistake by coming to Paris
 yadi vah washington main rah kar hi american pratinidhiyon ko aadesh detaa rahata to bahut sambhav tha ki uskaa prabhaav adhik vyapak hota, par wilson ko sarvaadhik chintaa rashtrasang kii thi or uski abhilaashaa thi ki vishwa sanstha ke vidhaan kaa nirmaan vah swayan kare
 In fact, it was very unfortunate that while his presence at the conference was not beneficial to the conference itself, he could not even keep contact with the American public while away from his country, which resulted in the United Nations being nurtured by his own country
 Only rejected
 american seenet ne wilson ke rashtrasang kii sadsyta ke prastaav ko nahin mana
 In the 1918 congressional elections, the anti-wilson Republican Party won a majority in both houses of Congress, and the Senate revoked the League's consent to accept the Treaty of Legislature and Versailles

 Woodrow Wilson believed that public administration should separate from politics
 unhen saamaanya taur par prashasan or raajnneeti main vibhaajan ko rekhaankit karne ke kaaran yaad kiya jaataa he
 According to Wilson, the composition of a constitution is easy but it is difficult to implement it
 unhone kriyanvayan ke kshetra ke adhyayan par vishesh bal diya
 In his essay Study of Administration, Wilson, while discussing the interrelationships of politics and administration, wrote that administration is outside the domain of politics
 prashasnic samasyaayen raajnneetik samasyaayen nahin hoti hai
 Although politics can determine the function and nature of administration, it should not be given the right to manipulate administrative aspects

 There is pressure in air
 saadharantaya isaki anubhuti hamen nahin hoti
 If air is removed from any part of our body, then we feel the pressure of air easily

 As we rise up in the air, somehow the pressure decreases
 yahan tak ki kuch pahaad ke shikharon par dabaav kii maatra prati varg inch 9 pound bhaar tak pai gai he
 Air can also be suppressed
 dabaane se uskaa dabaav bad jaataa he
 Such suppressed air is called compressed air
 dabaane kii is kriya kaa 'sampidit karnaa' kehete hai
 The volume of air is reduced by compression and the pressure increases
 is prakaar vaayu kaa dabaav kaaphi unchaa badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Compressed air is being used in a lot of work today
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki do sau se adhik kaamon main ho rahaa he
 It is said to be happening in over two hundred works

 Compressed air receiving machines are called air compressors
 vaayu ko sampidit karne kaa sabase saral upkaran bisikil yaa motorcar ke tubon main hawa bharne kaa vaayu pump he
 However, high pressure compressed air cannot be obtained from the air pump
 adhik dabaav ke liye zatil vaayu sampidak bane hai
 Initially, they were used to make tunnels by cutting mountains with compressed air-driven drills
 peeche rail ke brikon main bhi inkaa upyog shu degree hua
 Normal air compressors produce 60 to 100 pounds of pressurized air per square inch
 aise bhi sampidak bane hai jinase hajaaron pound dabaav kii vaayu praapt ho sakati he
 The compressor has a piston inside the cylinder
 silinder ke ek chor par do valve, ek bheetar kii ore khulanevaala or doosraa baahar kii ore khulanevaala hota he
 When the piston of the cylinder is pulled to the top end, the air pressure inside the cylinder decreases and the air from the atmosphere is pulled by this valve
 jab piston ko neeche kiya jaataa he, tab dabaav ke bad jane ke kaaran andar khulanevaala valve band ho jaataa he or baahar se khulanevaala valve khul jaataa he, jisase silinder kii vaayu nikalakar "vayukaksh" main chali jaati he
 By repeating this process several times, the air pressure of the leukocyte gradually increases
 upyukt dabaav kii vaayu ko nal dwaara nikaalkar kaam main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Air compressors can be divided into three categories: pratyaagmani vayusampidak adhik upyog main aate hai
 Their principle is the same as described above
 vaayu pump dwaara hi cycle or motor gadiyon ke tub main hawa bhari jaati he
 Tunnels can be made by drilling holes in the mountains with compressed air driven drills obtained from air compressors
 vaayu sampidak dwaara hi theatre, cinemagharon, badi badi imaaraton or khaanon main sanvathan kiya jaataa he, jisase ashuddh vaayu nikalakar uskaa sthaan shuddh vaayu le leti he
 Milling can also be done with this help
 sampidit vaayu se bade hathode chalaakar koyala, pathar, baaluu, kancreet aadi tode or pise jate hai
 Compressed air obtained from the air compressor can be riveted and iron and steel can be peeled
 sampidit vaayu kii sahaayta se bade bade jahaajon, vayuyanon, motorkaron aadi par polish ko ja sakati he or varnish chadhaai ja sakati he
 Cleaning of houses, whitewash of walls and varnish on rangis and furniture is done at a lesser cost with the help of compressed air from air compressors
 anek saamaanon kii safai tathaa makaanon kii buharai bhi isaki sahaayta se hoti he
 Rail brakes work with compressed air force
 sampidit vaayu kii sahaayta se anek saamaanon, jaise anaaj, koyale aadi, ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak bheja ja saktaa he
 The list of uses of compressed air is quite long
 sampidit vaayu kaa upyog aadhunik vigyaan kii ek mahatvapurn dein he

 yah sutara sahitya ke samaan bahut hi sankshipt style main likhaa gaya he, jahaan prayek pankti ek jatil pranali ko yaad karne ke liye sahaayta karti he

 People started calling it sine because of the ease
 jab arabi lekhakon dwaara unke kaam kaa sanskrit se arabi main anuwaad kiya gaya, to unhone isko jiba kaha 
 Since, in Arabic writing, vowels are used less frequently, hence its more abbreviated name
 jab baad ke lekhakon ko ye samaj main aayaa ki jb jiba kaa hi sankshipt rup he, to unhone vaapis jiba kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 Jiba means "koh" or "trench"

 And after that in English, the sinus itself became the sign

 Here gives an example from Bhaskara's interpretation on Aryabhatiya: arthath, bataaen n = 8x+ 5 = 9y +4 = 7z +1
 isse n ke liye sabase chota maan 85 nikalataa he
 In general, the diophantine equations were notorious for rigidity

 Aryabhata's method has been called the Kuttaka method for solving such problems
 kuṭṭaka kuttak kaa arth he peesna, arthath chote chote tukdon main todna or is vidhi main choti sankhyaon ke rup main mul khandon ko likhane ke liye ek punaravarti kalanvidhi kaa samavesh tha
 Today this algorithm, according to Bhaskar's interpretation in 621 AD, is the standard method for solving first-order diophantine equations, and is often referred to as the Aryabhata algorithm
 diophentine samikarnon kaa istemaal kryptolujee main hota he or aresae sammelan, 2006 ne apana dhyaan kuttak vidhi or sulvasutra ke purv ke kaaryon par kendrit kiya
 In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata has provided interesting results for the classes and ranges of cubes
 or Aryabhata's astronomy system was called the Auric system, his later writings on astronomy, which propose a second model, superficially, have been lost, but they can be partially reconstructed from the discussions in Brahmagupta's Khandakhadyaka
 is
 kuch granthon main ve prithvi ke ghurnan ko akaash kii abhaasi gati kaa kaaran bataate hai
 Aryabhata seemed to believe that the earth revolves around its axis
 yah srilanka ko sandarbhit ek kathan se gyaat hota he, jo taron kii gati kaa prithvi ke ghurnan se utpann aapekshik gati ke rup main varnan karata he
 The next stanza describes the motion of stars and planets as actual motion: lanka yahan bumadhya rekha par ek sandarbh bindu he, jise khagoleey gananaa ke liye madhyahn rekha ke sandarbh main samaan maan ke rup main le liya gaya tha
 Aryabhata has described a seismic model of the solar system, in which the sun and the moon move through the home cycle, orbiting the Earth
 is model main, jo paaya jaataa he pitamahasiddhanth, prayek grahon kii gati do grahchakron dwaara niyantrit he, ek chota mand grahchakr or ek bada sheeghra grahchakr
 The order of the planets according to the distance from Earth is as follows: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Constellation grahon kii sthiti or avadhi kii gananaa samaan rup se gati karte hue binduon se saapeksh ke rup main kii gayi thi, jo budh or shukr ke maamle main, jo prithvi ke chaaron ore ausat surya ke samaan gati se ghoomte hai or mangal, brihaspati or shani ke maamle main, jo raashichakr main prithvi ke chaaron ore apni vishisht gati se gati karte hai
 According to most historians of astronomy, this two-planetary model reflects elements of Greek astronomy prior to Ptolemy
 aryabhat ke model ke ek anya tatv sighroka, surya ke sambandh main buniyadi grahon kii avadhi, ko kuch itihaaskaaron dwaara ek antarnihit surya kendrit model ke chinh ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 He said that the moon and planets shine with the reflected light of the sun
 maujuuda brahmandavigyaan se alag, jisame grahanon kaa kaarak chhadam grah nispand bindu raahu or ketu the, unhone grahanon ko prithvi dwaara daali jane vaali or is par girane vaali chaaya se sambaddh bataaya
 Thus lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters the Earth's shadow and discusses in detail the size and extent of this Earth's shadow and then the size of the eclipse part during the eclipse and its calculation
 baad ke bhartiya khagolavidon ne in gananaaon main sudhaar kiya, lekin aryabhat kii vidhiyon ne pramukh saar pradaan kiya tha
 The calculation was so accurate that the 18th-century scientist Guillaume le Gentil, during his visit to Pondicherry, found that the period of lunar eclipse of 1765-08-30 by Indians was calculated to be 41 seconds shorter, while its charts were 68 seconds

 This approximation was a significant improvement over the computation of the Greek mathematician, Eratosthenes, 200 AD), whose calculations are not known in modern units, but his estimate had an error of about 5–10%

 Aryabhata claimed that the Earth rotates on its own axis and that some elements of their planetary planetary models rotate at the same speed with which the planets revolve around the Sun
 is prakaar aisa suzav diya jaataa he ki aryabhat kii sangannaayen anternihit surya kendrit model par aadhaarit thim, jisame grah surya kaa chakkar lagaate hai

 haalaanki kuch log yah sweekaar karte hai ki aryabhat kii pranali purv ke ek surya kendrit model se upji thi jiskaa gyaan unako nahin tha
 It has also been claimed that they considered the planets to be elliptical, although no primary evidence has been presented for this

 Aryabhata's work had a major influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and through translation he influenced many neighboring cultures
 islamic swarna yug, ke dauraan iskaa arabi anuwaad vishesh prabhaavshaalee tha
 Some of his results are cited by al-khwarizmi and referenced by 10th-century Arabic scholar al-biruni, who wrote in his description that Aryabhata's followers believed that the earth rotated on its axis
 sin, kosine ke saath hi, varsin kii unki paribhaasha,or vilom sin, ne trikonmiti kii utpatti ko prabhavit kiya
 He was also the first person to construct sine and versatile tables, from 0 ° to 90 ° at 3
75 ° intervals, to a precision of 4 decimal places
 vastav main "sin " or "kosine " ke aadhunik naam aryabhat dwaara prachlit jya or kojya shabdon ke galat uccharan hai
 He was pronounced in Arabic as Jiba and Kojiba
 phir ek arabi jyamiti paath ke latin main anuwaad ke dauraan cremona ke jerard dwaara inaki galat vyakhya kii gayi; unhone jiba ke liye arabi shabd 'jeb' liya jiskaa arth he "poshaak main ek tah", el sinus 
 Aryabhata's methods of astronomical calculation were also very influential
 trikonmitik talikaon ke saath, ve islamic duniya main vyapak rup se istemaal kii jaati thi
 And many Arabic astronomical tables were used to calculate
 vishesh rup se, arabi spain vaigyanik al-jharkaali ke kaaryon main pai jane vaali khagoleey talikaon kaa latin main tolado kii talikaon ke rup main anuwaad kiya gaya or ye europe main sadiyon tak sarvaadhik sookshm panchang ke rup main istemaal main rahi
 The date calculations done by Aryabhata and his followers have been in continuous use in India for practical purposes of determining the Panchang or Hindu calendar, which was also transmitted to the Islamic world, where they formed the basis of the Jalali calendar, which Omar Khayyam in 1073 Including some astronomers, the version of which is presented as a national calendar in Iran and Afghanistan today
 Are in use jalaalee tithipatr apni tithiyon kaa aankalan vaastavik saura pargaman ke aadhaar par karata he, jaisaa aryabhat

 Although dates were difficult to calculate, the Jalali calendar had fewer seasonal errors than the Gregorian calendar

 Pakistan's land is the national anthem of Pakistan
 ise urdu main "qaumi taraana" kaha jaataa he
 It was written by Hafeez Jalandhari and composed by Akbar Muhammad
 yah san 1954 main pakistan kaa raashtragan bana or us se pehle jagannatha azaad dwaara likhit "i sarazamin-e-paak" pakistan kaa raashtragan tha
 There is more emphasis on Persian words than ordinary Urdu in Pak land
 14 agast 1947 ko bharat vibhajit hua or purv or pashchim main ek nae desh pakistan ne janm liya
 The dream of Quaid Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah of Pakistan came true
 nayaa desh banane ke saath hi desh ke liye vibhinn chinh or pratik chunane kaa kaam bhi shuru hua
 The country's flag was already prepared, but the national anthem was not made
 azaadi ke samay pakistan ke paas koi raashtra-geet nahi tha
 Therefore whenever the flag was chanted, "pakistan Zindabad, Azadi Pindabad" slogans were raised
 jinnah ko yah manzur nahi tha
 He wanted that the work of creating the national song of Pakistan should be completed soon
 unke salaah kaaron ne unako anekon janemaane urdu shaayaron ke naam sujhaaye jo geet rach sakate the
 But Jinnah's thinking was different
 unhen laga ki duniya ke samaksh pakistan kii dharmanirpeksh chhavi sthapit karne kaa yah acha mauka he
 So he told the great Urdu poet and native Hindu Jagannath Azad of Lahore that "I can give you only five days, you can write a national song for Pakistan"
 jagannatha azaad achambhit bhi the or khush bhi the
 But the radical leaders of Pakistan were very angry that a Hindu would write the national anthem of Pakistan
 lekin jinnah kii marzi ke aage ve bebas the
 Finally, within five days Jagannath Azad composed the national song which Jinnah liked very much
 gane ke bol the - Oh my heart, your love is better than mine, today your happiness is nowhere jinnah ne ise raashtra-geet ke rup me manyata di or unki mrityu tak yahi geet raashtra-geet bana rahaa
 But just 18 months after the acceptance of this song, Jinnah died and with him the recognition of the national song was ended
 jagannatha azaad baad main bharat chale aae
 After Jinnah's death, the Government of Pakistan formed a rashtra-geet Committee
 or jane maane shairo ke paas se geet ke namoonay mangavaaye
 But no song was able to become a national song
 aakhirkaar pakistan sarkaar ne 1950 me ahamed chagala dwaara rachit dhun ko rashtriya dhun ke rup me manyata di
 At the same time, Shah of Iran visited Pakistan and liked the tune
 yah dhun paashchaatya adhik lagati thi, lekin raashtra-geet cameti kaa maananaa tha ki iskaa yah swaroop paashchaatya samaaj me adhik sweekrut hoga
 In 1954, Urdu poet Hafiz Jalandhari composed a song based on this tune
 yah geet raashtra-geet cameti ke sadasyon ko pasand bhi aayaa
 And finally the song written by Hafiz Jalandhari became the national song of Pakistan

 It has written about philosophy and knowledge, it is silent about rituals
 inaki bhashaa vaidic sanskrit he
 There is a combined designation of Vedas, Mantras and Brahmins
 mantrabrahmanyorvednamadheyam 
 The Aranyak is the least of the three parts of Brahman
 sayan ke anusaar is namakaran kaa kaaran yah he ki in granthon kaa adhyayan arany main kiya jaataa tha
 The main theme of Aranyaka is the spiritual epistemology of rituals, rather than rituals of sacrificial fires
 vastut: yajna kaa anushthan ek nitant rahasypurna pratikatmak vyapaar he or is pratik kaa puraa vivaran aaranyak grantho main diya gaya he
 The glory of pranavidya is also featured in these texts
 samhita ke mantron main is vidya kaa beej avashya uplabdh hota he, parantu aaranyakon main isi ko pallavit kiya gaya he
 The fact is that the Upanishads elaborately explain the facts indicated in the Aranyaka
 is prakaar samhita se upanishdon ke bich kii shrinkhalaa is sahitya dwaara purna kii jaati he
 The spiritual importance of the Aranyaka texts is more than that of the Brahmin texts
 ye apane naam ke anusaar hi arany yaa van se sambaddh hai
 What is read or taught in Aranya is called 'aranyak' - Aranya Bhavam Aranyakam
 aaranyak granthon kaa pranayan praayah brahmanon ke pashchaat hua he kyonki isamen durbodh yajna-prakriyaaon ko sookshm aadhyatm se joda gaya he
 These texts have been composed primarily for the knowledge of self-realization and theology for the Vanaprasthis and ascetics - it is believed
 aaranyak granth vastutah brahmanon ke parishisht bhaag hai or upanishdon ke purvarup
 In the Upanishads, the beginning of the serious philosophical themes about theatricalism, creation and philosophy is visible in the Aranyakas
 aaranyakon main vaidic yaagon ke aadhyatmik or darshanik pakshon kaa vivechan he
 There is a special description of life in these
 kalchakra kaa vishad varnan taittiriya aaranyak main praapt hota he
 The description of Yajnopaveet is also found first in this Aranyaka
 vaidic tatvamimasaa ke itihaas main aaranyakon kaa vishesh mahatva sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 In this, the deep mysteries of Yajna have been inaugurated
 inamen mukhya rup se aatmavidya or rahasyatmak vishyon ke vivaran hai
 It seems that these texts have been practiced for the vanaprastha-ashram dwellers who are engaged in self-study and religious work in the forest
 aaranyak granthon main pranavidya kii mahima kaa vishesh pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 Apart from pranavidya, Aryanakas have special significance in describing the symbolism, theosophy, spirituality
 anek aitihaasik or saanskrithik tathyon kii prastuti ke kaaran bhi aaranyak granth upoday hai
 In fact, these texts are like a link connecting Brahmin texts and Upanishads, as they help in studying the development of the Upanishads' prophetic subject and language style
 aaranyakon ke mukhya granth nimnlikhit he : It is related to Rigveda
 aitarey ke bheetar paanch mukhya adhyay hai jinamein pratham teen ke rachayita aitarey, chaturth ke aashvalyan tathaa pancham ke shaunak maane jate hai
 Dr
 Keith considers it to be ancient rather than Nirukta, and its creation is considered to be pre-century century old, but in fact it is older than Nirukta
 aitarey ke pratham teen aaranyakon ke karta mahidas hai isse unhen aitarey brahman kaa samakaleen maananaa nyaayay he
 It is also related to the Rigveda
 yah aitarey aaranyak ke samaan he tathaa pandrah adhyyon main vibhakt he jiskaa ek ansh kaushitaki upanishad ke naam se prasiddh he
 Divided into ten passages, called "aran"
 inamen saptam, ashtum tathaa navam prapathak milakar "taittiriya upanishad" kehalaate hai
 In fact, Shukla is one of the Aranyakas of the Yujurveda, but due to the abundance of spiritual facts it is counted in the Upanishads
 samaveda se sambhddha ek hi aaranyak he
 Which has four chapters and many chapters in each chapter
 chaturth adhyay ke dasham anuwak main prakhyat tavalkaar upanishad he
 Every Veda has one or more Aranyakas
 atharvaveda kaa koi aaranyak uplabdh nahin he
 According to the Aranyakas, according to the Vedas, yadhyapi atharvaveda kaa pruthak se koi aaranyak praapt nahin hota he, tathaapi uske gopath brahman main aaranyakon ke anuroop bahut si saamagree milti he

 When the fruit of the huge yard-shaped berries of Jambuvriksha, grown in the lap of Merumandar, collides with those mountain king Merumandar, then its juice is liquefied with the fruit from which the red juice created the river called Jambu
 us nadi ke jal ko vahaan ke jan, jeevajantu pite hai jisase vahaan ke logon ko budhapa, shaareerik durgandh tathaa pasinaa or indriyakshay jaise rakshas nahin sataate

 Give message to Subedar

 "" The idol disappeared after saying so much
 susawaani ji uthi or unhone apane swapn kaa sab haal apni mata ji se kaha or uske pramaan swarup sab ke mastak par kesar ke tilak dekhe gayi
 Everyone got patience and a message was sent to the Subedar immediately
 soobedaar sunakar prasann hua or turant sweekruti de di
 Preparations started with enthusiasm on both sides
 sethji ko mukt kar diya gaya
 Very soon, after taking a lot of punishment, some soldiers came to Sethji's building with some soldiers
 daudane se purv unhone apane ghar ke daravaaje par kunkum bhare haath kaa chapa lagaaya
 Even today it is marked as stone
 satya katha kaa wo dyotak he
 With seven legs left, Suswani started running ahead and the Subedar along with his soldiers sat on a horse and followed them
 prastaavit kaarykram ke anusaar susawaani paidal daudane lagi or soobedaar ashv par saat kadam peeche
 The race started with the first ray of sunrise
 donon milon daudte rahe parantu faasla yathaavat rahaa
 When Suswani ji is tired of running, she has prayed! Protect me, i can't run anymore adhishthatri devi ne prarthana suni tabhi saamne se ek singh aata hua dikhaai padaa devi ne akashwani main unhen singh par savaar hokar aage badhane ko kaha
 According to knowledge, Suswani immediately rode on the lion and the lion started running
 chalate-chalate vartmaan bikaner ke antargat shri sindhu morkhana gaanv ke najadik pahunch gai
 There was a very ancient temple of Lord Shivshankar Bholenath
 Here too Suswani prayed to Bholenath, "lord, protect me
 mujhe chhipane kaa sthaan do
 "bhole Shiva appeared and threw his tongs towards the front of the temple and said -" o Goddess, you go straight to where the tong has fallen, where is your place
 "bholenath kaa phenkaa hua chimata ek ker ke ped ke bich main padaa tha
 As soon as Suswani reached there, both the earth and the tree exploded with words
 susawaani ji singh ke sahit usamen samaa gai or jameen phir jyon kii tyon ho gai
 Four fingers of Sujvani's rag were left out
 soobedaar or uske saathi us palle ko lekar hi jhagadne lage
 Everyone wanted to marry her
 baat bad gayi,talavaarein khinch gai or ve vahaan aapas main ladakar samaapt ho gayi
 Whose goddesses still exist in Morkhana

1229 se lekar aaj tak usee sthaan par haraa bharaa khadaa he

 He decided to get married
 
 Father was terrified after hearing this

 The Subedar was stubborn
 
 For not obeying
 dhamkee de di garaj-garaj kar
 
 kolhu main pisva daaloongaa

 Seth Satidas was a Hindu candidate
 nas-nas main hindutv bharaa tha
 Strongly turned down the offer
 soobedaar ne jail bhijwaya
 
 ghar waalon ko pataa chalaa jab| susawaani ji ko kosa tab
 
 man hi man jab dukhi hui mata
 The unhappy mind only cares for the Lord
 
 Thank you to Nan Mund Arihant
 dhyaan hi dhyaan main nindiya ai
 God stunning in a dream
 darshan dekar kaha vachan main
 
 ghabaraane kii baat nahin he
 This is not his place
 
 You will call that wicked one
 shart rakhi he tere aage
 
 saat paanvade kii chhot dekar
 Chase the horse up
 
 He will not be able to catch you
 daud-daud kar thak jaayegaa

 The forehead saffron was adorned with tilak
 
 Give message to Subedar

 donon taraf hi khushiyaan chai
 He gave release to Seth
 
 Suswani ji was standing ready
 ye to pariksha kii hi ghadi thi
 
 daud se pehle dwaar pe ai
 Kunkum's hand raided
 
 It is as it is in stone
 satya katha kaa wo dyotak he
 
 sasavani ji jab thak ke haari
 Calling mother to protect 
 Then there was loud air
 sher pe baith gai susawaani
 
 daud ke morkhana jab pahaunchi
 Shiva was inside the temple
 
 Bid protect Tripurari
 main ablaa hum sharan tihaari
 
 bhole ne phir haath ghumaya
 Maya was seen throwing tongs
 
 Suswani would have reached there
 prithvi vriksh attahas kar fatate
 
 susawaani ji prithvi main samaai
 The ground trembled all around
 
 Those goddesses are still there today
 susawaani mata bhi vahiin he
 
 ker kaa ped bhi vahiin khadaa he
 It is still green after years
