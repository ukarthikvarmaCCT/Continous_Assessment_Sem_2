 Kurmali, like Bangla, Odissi and Assamese, Magadhi is profuse and has a definite language like these
 bihari varg kii bhashaaon se iskaa prayaapt samya parilakshith hota he
 Despite their many similarities, Kurmali has its own personal characteristics that differentiates it from other magadhi-prasut languages
 kurmali kii dhvanigat visheshtayen, muhaavarey, lokoktiyaan, sur, taal, lay, vividh geet iske parthaky ke aadharbhoot kaaran hai
 It has a number of folk songs, folk tales, proverbs and riddles

 The imprint of Kurmali life is clearly reflected in these folk songs, folk tales and proverbs
 in vidhaon kii vividh rachanaaon se gyaat hota he ki kurmali sahitya jitna samridh he, bhav- soundarya kii drushti se bhi utana hi utkrisht
 From the point of view of teaching and learning, the Kurmali folklore can be divided into three periods
 iske antargat kurmali ke lok-geeton- dhap, biha, damakach, sarhul, natua, vandana, karam, edheia, udhwa, kuanrijupan, dhabaka, maharaai, ityadi lok-kathaye, lokoktiyaan, or paheliyaan hai, jinke rachayita agyaat hai
 Vinanda Singh, Gaurangiya, Barjuram, Narottama, Pitamber, Dina, Uday, Khep, Bogha, Ramacharya, Trilokya Nath Mandal, Handiram, Dima, Jaga, Haladhara are placed in the Janakavis of Kurmali in the medieval period

 Since Kurmali is an inter-native language, literature has developed immensely in modern times in Devanagari, Bengali, and Oriya scripts

 Generally, Kurmali literature can be divided into two parts: Kurmali folk literature and Kurmali Shishta literature
 lok sahitya main un saahitiyon ko rakhte hai, jinke udgam, kaal-nirdhaaran, yaa lekhak sambandhi koi nishchit anumaan lagaana sambhav nahin he
 This literature is a compilation of that developed traditional knowledge and literature of the Kurmi civilization that has been inherited by the Kurmali-speaking people in folk tales, folk songs, etc
 for generations
 kurmali lok-sahitya kii jo samagriyan milti hai, unhen ham mote taur par paanch virgon main rakh sakate hai:- There is a large number of folk songs in Kurmali
 aaj bhi ye geet lok-mukh main jivit he
 The song is very succulent and touching
 kurmali geeton kii parampara ati pracheen he
 No ritual is conducted without song and dance
 adhikansh geet nritygit hai
 Only the melody and characteristic of the songs can be understood by the raga
 kurmali jivan ke harek pahalu, vividh drushtikon or bahuaiami vichaar-dhaaraon ko kurmali loakgeet sansparsh karata he
 The main feature of the Kurmali folk songs is that most of the songs are in question form
 chand-vidhaan ke niyam se purnatah mukt he
 It has its own verses that are lyrical
 geeton ke le dwaara hi shailigat tatv ko pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 Someway ornaments have been used automatically
 kurmali lokgeeton ko kai virgon main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Such as Sanskar-songs, Ritu-songs, songs of deities, labor-songs, sports-songs, caste-songs, management songs etc
 kurmali ke pramukh loakgeet hai: udhwa, dhap, biha, damakach, sarhul, natua, diddhara, java-karam, edheia, dabaka, bandana, kuwanri- jhupaan aadi
 Generally, the portrayal of nature is found in sufficient quantity in the folk songs of Kurmali
 karam geeton main ankuroday, punarvivaah, krishi-karm, hasya-vyangy, jivan-yaapan kii paddhiti kaa ullekh miltaa he
 The marriage songs reflected the impression of Kurmali culture, social behavior, food, daily deeds, living

 Just as the beauty of a forest is a flower, the beauty of a home is a girl
 kurmali ke kuwanri jhupaan geeton main jaadu-tona, tantra-mantra evam andh-vishwaas kaa varnan miltaa he
 Diedadhara, dhap, etc

 People tell stories at night to cut the long night of winter around the house of Kumba or Dhandhaura in Khalian
 kurmali lok-kathao main alokik or asambhav batoo kii bharmaar rahati he
 One notable thing is that folk stories which are prevalent in America, Europe and other folk languages of our country, are also available in Kurmali with some difference
 kurmali ke lok-kathaon ko mukhya rup se teen virgon main baanta ja saktaa he: 1
 dharmik lok-kathaayen- yatha ‘karma-dharma’, teen thakurine, aar-ni-raham, aadi
 2
 shiksha-prada folk-tales- Such as budhik-daam, raikas-ar-amri, garkhia-ar-rajkumari, attukara-raja, coral-moti, karam-kapad, etc
 3
 manoranjan pradhan lok-kathaayen- yatha bouna, baadaa-siyaar, puitu-boodhaa, siarek-chouchhaali, benia-aar-charvaaha aadi Thus we come to the conclusion that in Kuramali folklore there is a realistic and lively depiction of various aspects of life

 The word Avidya is used in the sense of Maya
 bhram evam agyaan bhi iske paryaay he
 This may be a state of consciousness, but the object of which it is knowledge is false
 sansaarik jeev ahankaar avidyagrast hone ke kaaran jagat ko satya maan letaa he or apane vaastavik rup, brahm yaa aatma kaa anubhav nahin kar paata
 Seeing one truth in many forms and confusing me, you, yours, mine, this, that, etc
, is due to ignorance
 acharya shankar ke anusaar pratham dekhi hui vastu kii smritichaaya ko duusari vastu par aropit karnaa bhram yaa adhyas he
 The confusion of snake in the rope is due to this avidya
 isi prakaar maaya yaa avidya aatma main anatm vastu kaa aarope karti he
 According to Acharya Shankar, such practice is called avidya

 Avidya is also synonymous with Maya
 yadi maaya sarvadeshiy bhram kaa kaaran he to avidya vyaktigat bhram kaa karan he
 In other words, avidya is macya in macro form and avidya in my personal form
 shukti main rajat kaa abhas yaa rassi main saanp kaa bhram utpann hone par ham adhishthan ke mul rup kaa nahin dekh pate
 Avidya "covers" the establishment in two ways
 iskaa arth yah hua ki vah adhishthan ke vaastavik rup ko dhank detii he
 Second, it deflects, meaning it accuses another object
 avidya ke kaaran hi ham ek advait brahm ke sthaan par namrup se paripurna jagat kaa darshan karte hai
 That is why Avidya is called "bhavarupa", because she, due to her deflection power, invites Nanatya in place of Brahma
 anirvachaneey khyaati ke anusaar avidya na to sat he or na asat
 He is saddhasiddhika
 avidya ko anadi tatv mana ga he
 Avidya is the cause of bondage, because ego originates from this effect
 vaastaviktaa evam bhram ko thik thik jaananaa, veydant main gyaan kaha gaya he
 As a result, knowledge of Brahm and Avidya is called Vidya
 advait veydant main gyaan hi moksh kaa saadhan mana gaya he, atev vidya is saadhan kaa ek anivaary ang he
 The basic meaning of Vidya is knowledge of truth, knowledge of the supreme element or enlightenment
 advait vedant main parmarth tatv yaa satya maatr brahm ko sweekaar kiya gaya he
 There is no difference between Brahma and Atma
 yah aatma hi brahm he
 Astu can also be called Vidya, specifically Atmanism or Theosophy
 vidya ke do rup kahe gaye hai - aparaa vidya, jo nimna keti kii vidya maani gai he, sagun gyaan se sambandh rakhti he
 Salvation cannot be attained by this
 moksh praapt karne kaa ekmaatr saadhan paraavidya he
 This is also known as Atmavidya or Theosophy
 avidyagrasat jivan se mukti paane ke liye evam apane rup kaa saakshaatkaar karne ke liye para vidya ke ang hai
 If our learning is the first step, then the second step is the second step
 saadhan chatushtay se prarambh karke, mumukshu shravan, manan evam nidhidhyasana, in trividh maansik kriyaaon kaa kramik niyaman karata he
 After listening to the sentence "tattvamsi", he enters the meditation or samadhi state, going through the process of contemplation, where he becomes aware of "I am the Brahman"
 yahi gyaan para vidya kehalaata he
 The knowledge of the physical world, which is now called 'science', has been called as Upavidya in the Upanishads
 abhyuday or bhautikta, avidya ke paryaay hai
 Similarly, soullessness and spirituality are synonymous with learning

498028 The battle of Kadesh took place between the Egyptian Empire under the leadership of Ramesses II and the Hittite Empire under the leadership of Muwatalli II in the city of Kadesh
 yah yuddh 1274 isapurv main hua tha or yah itihaas kaa pehla yuddh he jiskaa likhit pramaan he saath hi yuddh main ranneeti kaa bhi ullekh he
 This is the war of history in which many chariots were used, about 5000 to 6000 chariots
 yah yuddh donon deshon ke bich shanti samjhaute ke saath khatm hua
 In ancient Egypt, foreign Hyksos ruled for many years, but gradually the power of the original kings of Egypt increased and they removed the rule of Hyksos and began conquering their neighboring states by adopting the policy of imperialism
 misr ke 18 wein vansh ke raajaaon ne sabase pehle is niti ko apanaaya or sabase pehla misr samrajya khadaa kiya, 18 wein vansh ke raja thutamos tritiy apni digvijiya ke kaaran kaaphi prasiddh hue
 But later, during the reign of King Akhenaten of the 18th dynasty, the Egyptian kingdom began to waver and he lost many of his provinces, Akhenaten abandoned the traditional religion of ancient Egypt and started worshiping God named Aten and declared it a national religion
 Because of which chaos spread in Egypt
 akhenaten ke baad uske putr tuthankhamun ne or uske uttaradhikariyon ne misr ke khoye hue gaurav ko waapas laane kaa kaaphi prayaas kiya par ve naakaam rahe
 Horemheb, the last king of the 18th dynasty, had no children, so he made his Amatya Rameses i his successor, and Rameses i laid the foundation of the 19th dynasty
 rameces pratham or uske putr seti pratham ne bhi 18 wein vansh kii tarah samrajyavad kii niti apanaai or misr ke khoye gaurav ko laane kaa prayaas kiya
 According to the accounts of the Karnak temple, Seti i had conquered Kannan and Syria
 vahi misr ke uttar main iraq se lekar turk tak failaa hittite samrajya bhi samrajya vistaar kar rahaa tha
 Siriya was then under the 18th dynasty but had gone under the Hittite empire
 misr samrajya ke khoye hue praant ko jitne ke liye rameces ne kadesh par hamalaa kiya jo ki syria kaa ek nagar tha
 Ramesses' father, Seti I, had conquered Kadesh during his reign, but at the last time of the reign of Seti I, Kadesh again came under the Hittite empire
 yah bhi yuddh kaa kaaran tha
 The Ramesses attacked Kadesh from the south in the 5th year of his reign
 vahiin hittite raja muvatalli ne apane padausi rajya ke saath milakar misr kii sena ke viruddh ek sangh bana liya tha
 Muwatalli deposited his army in Kadesh and sent his detectives to Ramesses, those spies told Ramesses that they were far from Kadesh
 san 1274 isapurv main rameces apni sena ke saath apni rajdhani pi rameces se kadesh kii taraf bada, uski sena amun, raa, set or pitaah naam kii chaar tukadio main vibhajit thi, ek or choti tukdi thi naarin naam kii jiskaa adhik ullekh nahin he
 Apart from the Egyptians, the army of Ramesses also had people from Kanan, Syria, Nubia etc
 rameces kai ratho kaa nirmaan karaayaa, itnaa kii itihaaskaar sirf andaaza laga sakate hai
 Regarding Muwatalli's army, Ramesses writes that Muwatalli had called an army of 19 neighboring states against Ramesses
 rameces apane lekh main likhvata he ki vah apni sena ke saath kadesh kii taraf bada, rameces amun tukdi main tha
 He first reached the hills of Kadesh, then crossed the river Orontes and reached the city of Kadesh
 amun tukdi rameces ke peeche thi, raa tukdi paas hi ke kazbe main thi, pitaah tukdi dakshin ke ek kazbe main thi or set tukdi sadak raste aa rahi thi
 When Rameses was 11 km away from Kadesh, he found some Banjaras who were actually Muwatalli's undercover, telling Rameses a lie that Muwatalli is afraid of the pharaoh and Hatti army is afraid to come here, Hatti army is in the land of Aleppo Which is 200 km from here
 par baad main jab un banjaaron kii pitayee kii gayi to unhone sach kabuula or bataaya kii muvatalli kii sena paas hi main he
 The entire Hatti army simultaneously attacked the Egyptian army
 rameces ne apni sena ko tukadio main baat diya tha or ve ek dusre se kaaphi dur thi, hathi sena ne sabase pehle raa tukdi par hamalaa kiya or use laghbhag nasht kar diya, bache hue yoddha kisi kadar amun tukdi tak pahoche
 Ramesses sent the message to the fathers and the set troops, but by then the Hatti army had reached the Amun unit
 hathi ratho ne amun tukdi kii suraksha diwaar tod daali or unhen maarna shuru kar diya
 Ramesses writes in his article that he was surrounded by the Hatti army, he had no bodyguard or any warrior
 phir rameces ne morcha sambhala or kai sesainik ko maar giraaya, phir kai amun or raa tukdi ke bache hue yoddha apane raja ko bachaane aa gaye
 Many warriors of the Hatti army went to plunder the Egyptian camps, and the survivors were fighting the Ramesses and the remaining Egyptian warriors
 rath or dhanush ke sahare misr sainik ne kaaphi hathi sesainik ko haraa diya
 The Ramesses had a good opportunity and attacked the unsuspecting Hatti army which was looting, the Ramesses drove the Hatti soldiers across the Orontes River
 hathi sena ke khadede jane ke baad bhi muvatalli ne dubaara ek badi sena bheji, us sena main kai rath, paidal sainik the jo nagar kii diwaar ke bheetar the
 The Hatti army again reached the Egyptian camp, but suddenly the Narine troops attacked, the Hatti army was stunned
 tab tak rameces ne apni puri sena jamaa kar lee or hathi sena par hamalaa bol diya
 Now the Hatti army was surrounded and almost destroyed, the remaining Hatti soldiers reached Kadesh somehow
 agle din dubaara yuddh shuru hua, rameces likhvata he ki muvatalli ne use yudhviram sandhi ke liye bulawaaya tha, par hittite lekh main iskaa koi ullekh nahin miltaa
 The Egyptian soldiers failed to demolish the walls of Kadesh, and Muwatalli also failed to drive out the Egyptian soldiers, while the victory seemed to be in his favor

 piech yaa ph, kisi vilyan kii amlata yaa ksharakta kaa ek maap he
 It is defined as the co-logarithm of the activity of liquefied hydrogen ions
 hydrogen aayan ke gatividhi gunank ko prayogtmak rup se nahin mapa ja saktaa he, isliye ve saidhantik gananaa par aadhaarit hote hai
 ph scale is not a fixed scale; It is concerned with a set of standard solutions whose ph is assessed by international contracts
 ph kii avadharana ko sabase pehle 1909 main carlsburg laboretry ke danish rasayanashastri, soren pedar luritz sorensen ne prastut kiya tha
 It is still unknown what the exact definition of p is
 kuch sandarbhon se pataa chalata he ki p, "power" kaa pratik he or anya ise german shabd "potenz" ke rup main sanderbhit karte hai or abhi bhi anya ise "potential" ke rup main sanderbhit karte hai
 Jens Norby published a paper in 2000 in which he argued that p is a constant and a symbol of "negative logarithm"; Which is also used in other works
 H, hydrogen kaa pratik he
 Sorensen suggested a "PH" signal for convenience that symbolized the "power of Hydrogen" using the co-logarithm of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution, p
 yadhyapi is paribhaasha kaa adhikraman kar diya gaya he
 If an electrode is calibrated with a solution of known hydrogen ion concentrations, p can be measured
 shuddh jal ko tatasth mana jaataa he
 25 ° c But the ph of pure water is around 7
0
 7 se kam ph vaale solution ko amleey kaha jaataa he or 7 se adhik ph vaale solution ko ksharkeey yaa kshareey kaha jaataa he
 Measurement of ph has great importance in medicine, biology, chemistry, food science, environmental science, oceanography and many other applications
 ph ko ek jaleey solution main hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi ke dashamalav laghuganak ke ghataav ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Due to its logarithmic nature characteristic, ph is a dimensionless quantity
 jahaan a H, hydrogen yanon kii gatividhi he
 The reason for this definition is that a h is a property of a single ion that can only be measured experimentally with the help of an ion-selective electrode that reacts with the activity of a hydrogen ion according to the Nernst equation
 ph ko saadharantah ek sanyukt glass electrode kii sahaayta se mapa jaataa he jo hydrogen ke aayan kii gatividhi ke prati samvedansheel ek electrode or ek calomel electrode yaa ek silver chloride electrode jaise kisi riference electrode ke bich ke potential antar yaa electromotive bal, E, ko maapta he
 The combined glass electrode ideally follows the Nernst equation: jahaan E, ek mapa gaya potential he or e 0, maanak electrode potential arthath maanak avasthaa kaa electrode potential he jisamen gatividhi bhi ek he
 r is the gas constant; t is the Kelvin temperature; f is a Faraday constant and n is an example of the number of electrons transferred
 electrode potential, E, hydrogen aayan kii gatividhi ke laghuganak kaa samaanupati hota he
 This definition is completely impractical in itself because the activity, concentrations, and activity coefficients of hydrogen ions are the product
 hydrogen aayan ke ekal-aayan kii gatividhi kaa gunank, ek aisi quantity he jise prayogtmak rup se nahin mapa ja saktaa he
 To get rid of this difficulty, the electrode is calibrated in relation to the solution of known activity
 ph kii sankriyaatmak paribhaasha ko aadhikarik rup main international standard ISO 31-8 ne nimna rup main paribhaashit kiya he: solution x ke liye, galvanik cell ke electromotive bal, e x ko mapa jaataa he | Concentrated Solution of kcl || Solution x | H2 | Pt and then the electromotive force of a galvanic cell, ES, is also measured which is different from the above by substituting solution X, ph of unknown ph by solution s of known standard ph
 tab X, kaa ph hota he The difference between the ph of the solution x and the ph of the standard solution depends only on the difference between the two measured potentials
 is prakaar, ph ko ek potential se praapt kiya jaataa he jise ek electrode ke saath mapa jaataa he jo ek yaa ek se adhik ph maanakon ke vipareet anshakit hota he; ek ph meter setting ko is prakaar se samyojit kiya jaataa he ki maanak ke solution kii meter kaa pathan, ph maan ke baraabar hota he
 The ph values of a range of standard solutions S, along with further detailed information, are indicated in the IUPAC recommendation
 maanak solution ko praayah maanak bafer solution ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he
 In practice, it is better to use two or more standard buffers to allow for small deviations from the normality of Nernst's law in real electrodes
 dhyaan den ki chunki taapmaana, paribhaashit karne vaale samikarnon main paaya jaataa he, isliye solution kaa ph, taapmaana-aadhaarit hota he
 Special procedures are required to measure very low ph values, such as some very acidic mine waters
 aise maamalon main electrode kaa anshankan, sandrit salphurik acid maanak solution ke saath kiya ja saktaa he jiske ph maanon kii gananaa, gatividhi gunankon kii gananaa karne ke liye pitzar maapdandon kaa prayog karke kii ja sakati he
 ph is an example of an acidity function
 hydrogen aayan kii sandratha ko ajaleey solvents main mapa ja saktaa he lekin iske falswaroop ek bhinn amlata ke function kii prapti hoti he kyonki ajaleey solvent kii maanak sthiti, jal ke maanak sthiti se bhinn hoti he
 Supersides are a class of azoleic acids for which the function of Hammett acidity, h 0, has been developed
 yah sorensen kii mul paribhaasha thi jise ph ke paksh main adhikramit kiya gaya
 However, it is possible to directly measure the concentrations of hydrogen ions if the electrode is calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations
 ise karne kaa ek tarika, jo bade scale par prayukt hota rahaa he, yah he ki becoground electrolite ke ek apekshaakrit ucch sandratha kii upasthiti main strong kshar ke gyaat sandratha ke solution ke saath ek strong acid ke gyaat sandratha ke solution kaa anumaapan karnaa he
 Since the concentrations of acid and alkali are known, it is easy to calculate the concentrations of hydrogen ions so that the measured potential can be correlated with the concentrations
 Calibration is usually done using gran plots
 anshankan, ek slop factor, f or maanak electrode potential, e 0 ke liye ek maan utpann karata he taaki nernst sameekaran ko form Experimental measurements of e can be used to obtain hydrogen ion concentrations
 slop factor saamanytah ek se thodaa kam hota he
 a slope factor of less than 0
95 indicates that the electrode is not functioning correctly
 becoground electrolite kii upasthiti yah sunishchit karata he ki anumaapan ke dauraan hydrogen aayan gatividhi gunank prabhavi dhang se sthir hota he
 Since it is constant, its value can be established by defining the standard state in a solution containing a background electrolyte
 is prakaar, is prakriya ke prayog ke parinamswaroop gatividhi ko sandratha ke sankhyatmak maan ke baraabar kiya jaataa he
 The difference between p and ph is very small
 yah kaha gaya he ki ph = p + 0

 durbhagyavash, donon prakaar ke maapan ke liye "ph" sangya kaa prayog karnaa bahut aam baat he
 poh is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of alkalinity or hydroxide ions, OH−
 poh ko swatantra rup se nahin mapa ja saktaa he balki ise ph se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Concentrations of hydroxide ions in water, dwaara hydrogen yanon kii sandratha se sambandhit hota he jahaan KW, jal ke swa-ynikaran kaa sthiraank he
 The following co-logarithm is taken to, kamare ke taapmaana par poh ≈ 14 − ph
 haalanki mitti kii kshariyata ke maapan jaisi anya paristhitiyon main yah sambandh puri tarah se maanya nahin he
 Pure water has a ph of about 7; The exact value depends on the temperature
 jab ek acid kaa vilyan jal main kiya jaataa he to ph, 7 se kam hoga or jab ek ksharak yaa kshar kaa vilyan jal main kiya jaataa he to ph, 7 se adhik hoga
 1 mol dm−3 sandratha par hydrochloric acid jaise kisi strong amla ke solution kaa ph, 0 hota he
 The ph of a strong alkali solution, such as sodium hydroxide, at 1 mol dm − 3 concentration is 14
 is prakaar, maape gaye ph ke maan adhiktar 0 se 14 ke antargat hi hoga
 chunki ph, ek laghuganakeey scale he isliye ek ph ikai kaa antar, hydrogen aayan sandratha main das guna antar ke baraabar hota he
 As the glass electrode reacts to the activity, the electrode must be calibrated in a medium that is similar to the medium being investigated
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi koi samudri jal ke ek namoonay ke ph ko maapna chahta he to electrode ko ek aise solution main anshakit kiya janaa chahie jisaki rasinic sanrachana samudri jal ke sadrush ho, jiskaa vistrut varnan neeche diya gaya he
 An approximate measurement of ph can be achieved by using a ph indicator
 ek ph indicater ek aisa sabstens he jo ek vishesh ph maan ke aas-paas ke rang ko badal detaa he
 It is a week acid or week base and the color change occurs either in the acid dissociation constant around 1 ph unit or in the pk a value, either side of either
 udhaaharan ke liye, swaabhaavik rup se parivartit hone vaala litmus, acidic solution main laal or alkaline solution main nila ho jaataa he
 Universal indicators consist of a mixture of indicators in such a way that there is a continuous color change from about ph 2 to ph 10
 universal indicater patr, saamaanya patr he jisamen universal indicater shaamil hota he
 The solution which has a ph of 7 is called neutral i
e
 it is neither acidic nor basic
 Water is subject to a self-ionization process
 pruthakkaran sthiraank, k w kaa maan lagbhag 10−14 hota he isliye namak ke neutral solution main hydrogen aayan sandratha or hydroxide aayan sandratha donon lagbhag 10−7 mol dm−3 hote hai
 The ph of pure water decreases as the temperature increases
 udhaaharan ke liye, 50 °C par shuddh jal kaa ph, 6
55 hota he
 Note, however, that water exposed to air is slightly acidic
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jal, hawa se carbon dioxide ko avashoshit kar letaa he jo baad main dhire-dhire carbonic acid main badal jaataa he jo hydrogen aayan ko mukt karke pruthak kar detaa he: In the case of a strong acid, complete dissociation occurs so ph is generally equal to the logarithm subtraction of the acid concentration
 udhaaharan ke liye, hydrochloric acid ke ek 0
01 molr solution kaa ph, −log hota he arthath ph = 2
 The ph of a solution of one week acid can be calculated through the ICE table
 lagbhag 2 se adhik pk a maan vaale acid ke liye, Where c0 is the acid concentration

 For this reaction the equilibrium constant ke dwaara nirdisht kiya gaya he jahaan, ek sandratha ko darshata he
 Analytical concentrations of two reagents, CA and for CH, must be equal to the sum of the concentrations of the sections containing the reagent
 CH is the concentration of added mineral acid

 a Roman numeral is also added behind these letters and numerals, which is I, II, III, IV or V

 The names of these scientists were William Wilson Morgan, Philippe C
 Keenan and Edith Calman, so the system is also called the "MKK" method, which is formed by adding the first English letters to their last names
 jahaan harvard shreneekaran sirf satahi taapmaana ke hisaab se chalata he or keval boune taron ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he vahaan yarkis shreneekaran main satahi taapmaana or chamak donon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or yah sabhi taron kaa shreneekaran karte hai

 He believed in 19th-century foreign and "other" subjects, which became famous with the rise in popularity of ethnology during Enlightenment
 19 veen sadi main dhumrapaan saadhaaran anand ke ek pratik ke rup main aam tha; pipe kaa dhumrapaan karata hua "kuleen daitya", pracheen roman khandhiron main gambhir chintan karte hue, pipe kaa kash lagaate hue chitra kalakaaron ke drishyon main se ek ban gaye

 cigarette dhumrapaan yaa cigar bohemian se bhi jud gaya, koi aisa jisane roodhiwaadee madhya varg ko tyaagaa tathaa roodhiwaad ke prati apmaan pradarshit kiya
 But it was a pleasure that was limited to the world of men only; Smoking women was seen to be associated with prostitution and it was not considered an action in which the right women involved themselves
 It was not until the turn of the century that smoking women appeared in pictures and photos in a chic and charming manner
 Impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh, who himself smoked pipes, became associated with smoking inspired by sadness and fin-du-siècle fatalism

 Since the era of silent films, smoking has been a core part of film symbols
 romaanchak film noir jaisi filmon main, cigarette kaa dhuaan aksar charitra ko darshata he tathaa yah aksar rahasy kaa aavaran yaa shoonyavad darshane ke liye bhi prayukt hota he
 One of these leading symbols can be seen in Fritz Lang's Weimar Era Dr
 Mabuse, Late Spieler, 1922, when people are amazed to see a gambler smoking while playing cards while playing
 shuruyaat main film main dhumrapaan karne vaali mahilaon ko bhi uttejkta tathaa mohak kaamuktha se jod kar dekha jaataa tha, jiname se sabase vishesh german film star marlin ditrich thim

 In addition to being a part of short stories and novels, smoking literature extends to endless accolades, confirming its qualities and the author's identity as a devoted smoker
 vishesh rup se 19veen shatabdi ke ant or shuruaati 20 veen sadi main, dhoomdhaam se tobaco : its history and associeshanz, cigarets in fact and fansy or pipe and paauch: da smokers on book of poitry jaisi kitaaben america or britain main likhi gai thim
 The titles were written by men to other men and include general gossip and poetic contemplation of love for smoking and all that pertains to it, as well as the continued appreciation of mature unmarried life

 pipe and paauch tambaaku kii thili se milte julate chamade ke bag main ai tathaa cigarets in fact and fansy pustak ke cover par chamada madha hua tha jo ek nakli cigaranuma dibbe main pack kii gai thi
 In the late 1920s, publications of this type of literature continued to decline on a large scale and could later be revived only at irregular periods in the 20th century

 Jazz was initially heavily associated with smoking in the places where it was played, such as bars, dance halls, jazz clubs, and even brothels
 Jazz also gained popularity with the expansion of the modern tobacco industry and contributed to the spread of cannabis in the United States
 The latter was known in the jazz community as "chai", "muggle" and "reefer" and was so effective from the 1920s to the 1930s that it made its way into songs composed at the time, such as those of Lewis Armstrong
 "muggles", Larry Adler's Smoking Reefers and Don Redman's "chant of the Weed"
 Marijuana continued to gain popularity among jazz musicians in the 1940s and 50s, until it was replaced by heroin use

 Rastafari considers cannabis smoking as a means of approaching God or Jah, an organization highly popularized by reggae symbols such as Bob Marley and Peter Tosh in the 1960s and 70s

 but non-violence has not worked
 " Arundhati, who has been cut short on charges of contempt of the judiciary, clearly says that she does not condemn those who took up arms
 unhone royatres ko intervyuu main kaha, "main ye kehane kii sthiti main nahin hoon ki har kisi ko hathiyaar uthaa lenaa chahie, kyonki main khud hathiyaar uthaane ko taiyaar nahin hoon
