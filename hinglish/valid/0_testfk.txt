 Scientists analyzing DNA analysis of African bush elephants, African wild elephants, Asian elephants, extinct American mastodons and mammoths came to the conclusion in 2010 that the African bush elephant and African wild elephant are arguably two distinct species
 unhone likhaa : This reclassification has great importance in terms of conservation
 abhi tak haathiyon ko ek hi jati kaa maanakar puri aabaadi kaa ek saath hi aankalan kiya jaataa tha
 But after reclassification, it will be convenient to figure out the population of elephant of a particular caste and find out which caste elephant is more in need of protection, because the law for the protection of elephant whose population comes within the periphery of the definition of threatened and Will have to be hardened and there will be a ban on illegal poachers and smugglers, trade of animals or their body parts belonging to that caste

 An algorithm running in polynomial time is known to factorize integers on a quantum computer
 par bahut prayaas ke vabjood bhi iske liye gaiyr-kwantum computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm nahin mil paaya he
 This has cast doubt on the Strong Church Turing thesis, an important hypothesis of theoretical computer science
 strong carch turing thisis ek darshanik tark he jo kahata he ki - jis computesnal problem ke liye kisi computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm ban saktaa he, us problem ke liye ek clasical computer par bhi polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm jarur hoga; or jis problem ke liye ek clasical computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm nahin ban saktaa he, us problem ke liye kisi bhi computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm nahin ban saktaa he
 Since a quantum computer for the factorization of integers is an algorithm running in polynomial time, according to the Strong Church Turing thesis it would require an algorithm running in polynomial time on a non-quantum computer as well
 isliye, agar koi ye sabit kar detaa he ki purnankon ke gunankhand ke liye ek gaiyr-kwantum computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm nahin ban saktaa he, to iskaa arth hoga ki strong carch turing thisis galat he

 Podcasts Q&A News articles Psychosis or schizophrenia is a mental disorder
 isaki visheshtaayen hai- asaamaanya saamaajik vyavhaar tathaa vaastavik ko pahchaan paane main asamarthta
 This disorder is found in about 1% of people
 is rog main rogi ke vichaar, samveg tathaa vyavhaar main asaamanya badlaav aa jate hai jinke kaaran vah kuch samay liye apni jimmedaariyon tathaa apni dekhbhaal karne main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Both 'psychosis' and 'schizophrenia' literally mean 'breakdown of mind'
 sizophrenia ke kuch pramukh lakshan hai, jaise ki shuruuaat main :- It is not necessary that all these symptoms are seen in every patient, so if any of these symptoms are seen in any person, then he should seek psychiatric advice immediately
 schizophrenia kisi bhi jati, varg, dharm, ling, yaa umr ke vyakti ko ho saktaa he
 Like other diseases, the disease can also be inherited from close family members, so it is more likely to occur in the patient's children, or siblings
 atyadhik tanaav, saamaajik dabaav tathaa pareshaaniyaan bhi beemaari ko banaaye rakhane yaa thik na hone dene kaa kaaran ban sakati hai
 Chemical changes in the brain or sometimes any brain injury can also cause this disease
 neeche die vyavhaarik badlaav rogi ko bigadati avasthaa ke sanket ho sakate hai :- If you feel that a person has these symptoms: - in anaavashyak prabhaavon ke hone par dawa kaa seven roke nahin kyonki yah prabhaav samay ke saath apane aap hi kam ho jate hai tathaa inako rokane ke liye saamaanya si saavdhaaniyaan bhi rakhi ja sakati hai, jaise :- The patient of schizophrenia can lead a perfectly normal life after taking the medication after the main symptoms go away
 vah apni kshamta ke anusaar naukari kar saktaa he, pard saktaa he, dost bana saktaa he tathaa apane sabhi sapane puure kar saktaa he
 a schizophrenia patient can marry after symptom-free, but he has to take care that the new changes in his life do not affect his sleep and medication
 yadi rogi stri hai to vah bina chikitsakeey salaah ke garbh dhaaran na karen
 In children with schizophrenia, the disease can be inherited, but it is not always necessary
 schizophrenia grasit koi vyakti shravan sambandhi vibhram, mithyabhram or asangathit tathaa aswabhaavik soch evam bhashaa pradarshit kar saktaa he; yah vichaar kii shrinkhalaa or vishay pravaah main nuksaan, jisamen vaakya arth kii drushti se keval aspasht rup se sambandhit hote hai, se lekar gambhir maamalon main asambandhata, jise shabd kaa salad kaha jaataa he, tak ho saktaa he
 Social segregation usually arises for various reasons
 saamaajik bodh main kshati sizophrenia se usee prakaar se sambandhit he, jis prakaar mithyabhram or vibhram se pairanoiya ke lakshan or evolision ke nakaaratmak lakshan sambandhit hai
 In an unusual subsystem, may remain stationary in the odd posture, or may display aimless stimuli; These are all symptoms of catatonia
 koi ek lakshan sizophrenia ke nidaan se sambandhit nahin he or sabhi anya chikitsa or maansik sthitiyon main ho sakate hai
 The current classification of psychiatrists assumes that disease symptoms must be present for at least one month over a period of at least six months of disturbed activity
 choti avadhi kii sizophrenia jaisi manovikruti ko chizophrenia rupi vikruti kaha jaataa he
 Late adolescence and early adulthood are the peak times of onset of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia kaa upachaar kiye jane vaale 40% purushon or 23% mahilaon main, yah sthiti 19 varsh kii umr se pehle utpann hui
 These are very important periods in the social and professional development of a young adult and can be severely hampered
 sizophrenia ke prabhaav ko kam se kam karne ke liye, beemaari ke praarambhik charan kii pahchaan karne or uskaa upachaar karne ke liye haal hi main paryaapt kaary kiye gaye hai, jiskaa pataa rog lakshanon ke shuru hone ke pehle 30 maheenon tak lagaaya gaya he, lekin ve adhik lambey samay tak upasthit rah sakate hai
 People who develop schizophrenia experience non-specific symptoms of social breakdown, irritability and restlessness in the early period, and transient or auto-limiting psychosis related symptoms in the early stages before the psychosis becomes apparent
 Can
 manochikitsak kurt shenidar ne manorog sambandhi lakshanon ke roopon ko soochibaddh kiya jise unhone mana ki ve schizophrenia ko anya manorog sambandhi vikaron se bhinn karte the
 These are called first-class signs or first-class symptoms of shenider and they include false illusions in the category of being controlled by an external force; The belief that thoughts are being put into one's conscious mind or withdrawn from it; The belief that the views of one person are being transmitted to other people; And listening for confused voices that comment on a person's thoughts or activities or have a conversation with other confused voices
 haalanki unhone vartmaan naidanik mandandon main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he, pratham shrenee ke lakshanon kii vishistataa par prashn uthaaye gaye hai
 a review of clinical studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that these studies allow neither a reaffirmation or rejection of Schneider's claims and suggested that future clinical systems revisions may be the first The emphasis should be on the symptoms of the category
 schizophrenia kaa varnan aksar ek sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak lakshanon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The term positive symptoms signifies symptoms that are not commonly experienced by most individuals but are present in schizophrenia
 unamem mithyaa bhram, shravan sambandhi vibhram or soch sambandhi vikaar shaamil hote hai or unhen vishesh rup se manovikruti kii abhivyakti mana jaataa he
 Negative symptoms are those that are not present in individuals affected by schizophrenia but are typically found in healthy people, that is, symptoms that reflect a loss or loss of general characteristics or abilities
 aam nakaaratmak lakshanon main neeras yaa kunthit karne vaale prabhaav or manobhaav, bhashaa main kripanata, anand kii anubhuti karne kii aakshamata, sambandh sthapit karne kii ichha kaa abhaav or prerana kii kami shaamil hai
 Research suggests that negative symptoms contribute more to poor quality of life, functional disability, and burden on others than positive symptoms
 kunthit karne vaale prabhaav kii upasthiti ke baavjood, haal ke adhyayanon se sanket miltaa he ki schizophrenia main aksar ek saamaanya yaa bhavukta kaa ucch str bhi paaya jaataa he, vishesh rup se tanaavpurn yaa nakaaratmak ghatnaon ke pratikriyaswaroop aisa hota he
 a third trait group, disruptive syndrome, is commonly discussed and includes chaotic speech, thoughts, and behavior
 anya lakshan vargeekaran kaa pramaan maujuud he
 The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made based on the morphology of the symptoms
 tantrika sambandhi sahasambandhi vasteen paryaapt rup se upyogi maandand uplabdh nahin karaati he
 Diagnosis is based on the individual's own experience report and abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends, or co-workers, and subsequently a clinical assessment conducted by a psychiatrist, social worker, clinical psychologist or other mental health professional
 manorog sambandhi moolyankan main ek manorog sambandhi itihaas or maansik sthiti pariksha ke kuch rup shaamil hote hai
 The most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia is the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition DSM-IV-TR and World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-10
 Is obtained
 baad ke maandand vishesh rup se europea deshon main prayukt hote hai jabaki DSM maandand sanyukt rajya america or duniya ke baaki hisson main prayukt kiye jate hai or saath hi ve anusandhan sambandhi adhyayanon main prachlit hai
 The ICD-10 criteria emphasize first-class symptoms of Schneiderian, although, in practice, the synergy between the two regimes is very high
 diagnostic and statistical minial of mental disorders ke chaturth sanskaran ke anusaar, sizophrenia kaa nidaan karne ke liye, teen naidanik maandand puure kiye jane chahie: Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of a mental condition or widespread developmental disorder are present, or if the symptoms are the direct result of a common medical condition or a substance, such as alcoholism or its medication
 manovikruti sambandhi lakshan kai anya maansik bimariyon main maujuud rahete hai, jisamen dwidhruvi vikaar, vyaktitv seemaa rekha vikaar, sickefective vikaar, madhpan, madhpan nashile-padaarth dwaara prerit manovikruti or schizophrenia swarupi vikaar
 schizophrenia ] a more general medical and neurological examination is required to rule out a health-related illness that can rarely cause symptoms similar to psychiatric schizophrenia, such as metabolic disturbances, serological infections, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy
 And brain wounds
 It may be necessary to remove unconsciousness, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, rapid attacks and unstable levels of consciousness, and indicates an underlying health disease
 aam taur par jaanch purvavastha prapti ke liye duhraaye nahin jate hai jab tak ki koi vishisht chikitsa sambandhi sanket nahin ho yaa manovikruti rodhi aushadhi kaa koi pratikul prabhaav nahin ho
 Greek σχίζω = "I refute") Despite the etymology of the word, "schizophrenia" does not mean double personality, DSM-IV-TR main schizophrenia ke paanch up-vargeekaran hai
 The ICD-10 defines two additional modalities
 schizophrenia kii vaidhata ko naidanik ikai ke rup main maanane hetu aalochana kii gai he kyonki isamen vaigyanik vaidhata or naidanik vishwasaneeyata kii kami paayi gai he
 In 2006, a group of mental patients and professionals from the UK debated under the flag of a movement to ban the schizophrenia label because it was rejected because clinical studies of schizophrenia were diversity-based and stain-linked and He called for the adoption of a biological-psychosocial model
 britain ke anya manochikitsakon ke samooh ne yah kah kar is prayaas kaa virodh kiya ki ek ek praavdhanik vichaardhaara hone ke baavjood schizophrenia shabd upyogi he
 The class of different types of schizophrenia used in DSM has also been criticized
 anya maansik vikaron ke samaan, kuch manochikitsakon ne suzav diya he ki anya vibhinnataaon ke saath vyaktigat ayaamon ke aadhaar par iske nidaan ko liya janaa chahie, jisase ki vahaan saamaanya or biimaar longon ke bich ek khai ke bajaae ek satatta bana rahe
 This approach seems very meaningful and serious for research on schizophrenia and its relevance to psychological experiences, which are mostly not stressful, and also build a clear trust among ordinary people
 is avlokan ke saath sahmati pragat karte hue manovaigyanik adgar jones or manochikitsak tony david tathaa nasir ghaemi ne bhranti par saahitiyon kaa paryvekshan karte hue ingit karte hue kaha ki mithyaa bhram kii paribhaasha kii samarupata or sampoornataa ko paane kii ichha bahut logon kii rahi he, mithyaa bhram na hi kabhi aavashyak rup se sthir hote hai, naa hi yah galat hota he or na hi inamen vartmaan kii niyantran ho sakane vaali ghatnaayen hi shaamil hoti hai
 Nancy Anderson, an emerging researcher in the field of schizophrenia, refutes the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria in her criticism of abandoning its validity for clinical improvement alone
 ve is baat par jor detii hai ki isaki naidanik vishwasaneeyata kaa sudhaar karte samay naidanik maapdandon kii manovikruti par adhik bal dene se iskaa moolbhoot gyaan ko ham baadhit kar dete hai jiskaa moolyankan karnaa prastutikarnon main isaki badi vibhinnata ke kaaran sambhav nahin he
 This ideology has also been considered by other psychiatrists
 isi kram main ming tsang or uske sahyogi is baat par paricharchaa va bahes karte hai ki manovikruti ke lakshan sabhi main saamaanya ho sakate hai bhale hi iske antim str kii vikruti par vibhinnataayen ho sakati hai, jisamen schizophrenia ko shaamil kiya gaya he, bajaae iske ki schizophrenia kii ateology yaa hetuvigyaan ke vishisht vishaleshan par sachet karte hai ki dsam ke sambandh main bahut kam parichaalanaatmak paribhaasha schizophrenia ke nirmaan par "sahi" uplabdh he
 Neuroscientific Michael Foster Green goes further to suggest that the presence of specific mechanisms of cognition impairment can be used to produce phenotypes that are purely symptom-based alternatives
 sah haniyaan baadhita yaa kami ke aadhaar par manovaigyanik gatividhiyon ke rup main parilakshith hoti hai jaise dimag, aakarshan, kaaryon kii kaarywahi or samasya ko suljhaana
 Removing influential factors from schizophrenia criteria, even though this therapeutic system is widespread, has also led to resistance
removing it from the DSM main se ise nikaal dene ke parinamswaroop ek "samaj main nahi aane vaale" alag prakaar kii vikruti – sizophreniavikruti ban kar saamne aayi he
 Referring to very weak reliability, some psychiatrists have completely opposed the idea of schizophrenia as a separate entity
 bhav vikruti or schizophrenia ke bich shrenikrut antar ko craayepelinian dishotomi kehete hai, jisane anuvaanshik epidemyology ke aankadon ko bhi chunauti di he
 Because the reliability of diagnostics creates difficulty in the measurement of its associated effects, examples suggest that genetic and environmental factors may play a role in mixers in schizophrenia outcome
 udaahranon se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki schizophrenia ke naidanik upachaar main mahatvapurn kaarak nihit hote hai lekin ve paryaavarniya karkon or tanaav paidaa karne vaale ghatakon ke mahatv ko prabhavit karte hai
 The implicit idea of overpopulation can be extracted biologically in some people and is known as the stress – diathesis model
 yah vichaar ki jeevigyaanik, manovaigyanik or manochikitsakeey tathaa saamaajik kaarak, sabhi mahatvapurn he, ise "biopsicososhal" model ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Generational assessments of schizophrenia have shown that the problem of isolating the effects of genetics and studies of isolated environments have shown that a high degree of heredity is found in it
 yah bhi suzav diya gaya he ki schizophrenia visham antarnihit anuvaanshiki ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen vibhinn bade or chote jokhimon ke jeens ke badhane ke saath hote hai
 Some people have suggested that it is necessary to have several genetic and other risk factors, before one is affected by it, but there is no certainty in it either
 Recent studies of the genome wide association for schizophrenia and commonly practiced disorders are largely isolated, but there are still some shortcomings between these two disorders
 anuvaanshik se jude adhyayan metaenalysis ne bahut hi gambhir or thos udhaaharan gun-sutreey kshetra main shankaaon ke badhane par prastut kiya he, jo pratyaksh rup se vikarayukt schizophrenia 1 jin protein se sampark karata he, jo haal hi main zinc pifungar protein 804e main shaamil he
 Which is characterized by the trait 6 HLA region under which schizophrenia has been associated with rare deletions or microscopic mimicry of DNA sequences, and contains disproportionately neuro-signaling and brain development genes
 schizophrenia main janankshmata kii kamajori ke vidyaman hone kii bahut hi kam shankaa kii jaati he

 The most prominent central anthropomorphic dilemma is why schizophrenia occurs, if the disease is due to the associated causes of biological heterogeneity, can this variation not be selected and separated? It is necessary to have a complementary and global feature to maintain a balance between such significant inequalities
 atah anumaanit visheshtaon ke sabhi siddhanton ko amaanya kar diya gaya he yaa ve mahatvaheen sabit hue hai
 The occurrence of contingency factors with early neurovicas also increases the risk of developing schizophrenia later

 Living in urban environments continuously for a long time has also been considered as a risk factor for schizophrenia

 Childhood experiences of abuse or trauma have also been implicated later in life as a risk factor for the diagnosis of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia ke liye mata-pita kii dekhbhaal ko jimmedaar nahin mana gaya he lekin asahyogaatmak sambandhon kaa tut janaa bhi iske jokhimon ke badhane main sahaayak hota he
 However, in about half of schizophrenia patients, it was found that they used drugs or alcohol, which are difficult to prove the association between drug use and the apparent contingency of schizophrenia
 iske liye aksar istemaal kiye jane vaale do vyakhyaaon main hai "iskaa lagaataar istemaal sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he" or "iskaa lagaataar upyog hi chizophrenia kaa kaaran he" or yah donon baaten sahi hai
 The 2007 metaanalysis estimates that frequent use increases mental impairment based on the amount of the drug, including schizophrenia

 Because psychosis itself is highly understood and metaemphatime can result in the presence of cocaine use or cocaine-based psychosis with similar symptoms, even when the user is avoiding it
 manochikitsa virdohi andolan ke taur par jane jane vaale prayaas jo 1960 ke dashak main atyadhik sakriy the, rudhiwaadi medical vichaardhaara kaa virodh karte hai ki sizophrenia ek beemaari he
 Psychiatrist Thomas Sasas insists that the psychopath does not get sick, but that person gets lost in the unconventional thoughts and habits that our society considers inconvenient
 ve kehete hai ki samaaj in parais prakaar biimaar or unki aadaton ko vargeekrut karke unke saath anyaay karata he or unke prati kathorta kaa vyavhaar apane saamaajik niyantran ke adheen karata he
 According to this ideology, 'schizophrenia' does not occur but it is a type of social construction, created by those who distinguish between the normal and the unusual in society
 ssaaj ne manochikitsakeey upachaar ke maamle main apane aap ko kabhi bhi "manochikitsa virdohi" nahin samajha he, lekin ve aisa maanate hai ki vayaskon ke bich paraspar paraamarsh se upachaar prarambh kiya janaa chahie basharte iske ki ise vyakti kii ichha ke viruddh us par thopa jaae
 a set of informal psychiatric systems has been designed for the development and care of schizophrenia
 sangyaan main laae gaye paddhtiyon ko naidanik upachaaron ke jokhimon ke saath chinhit kiya gaya he, visheshkar jab vyakti tanaav yaa vismay kii sthiti main hota he, isaki haniyon par atyadhik dhyaan dena, nishkarshon par ekadam pahunch janaa, aakasmik aropan karnaa, saamaajik or maansik staron ke bare main baadhit yuktikaran karnaa, apane andar kii bhaavana ko kisi bahari strot dwaara vyakt nahin kar paanaa or praarambhik taur par drishy kii samasya kaa hona or isaki ekaagratha se dekhbhaal shaamil he
 Some of the well-known features are global neurocognitive impairment in the brain, attention, attention, problem diagnosis, action or social cognition, while others are associated with a particular case and experience
 "adhardaar prabhaav" ke saman taur par hone ke baavjood haal ke nishkarshon se pataa chalaa he ki kai vyaktiyon main sizophrenia ke dauraan ucch bhavuk pratiuttaron, visheshkar tanavagrast yaa nakaaratmak indrio or aisi vikruti ke samvedansheeltaa lakshanon ke samroop vyapti kaa kaaran bhi banati he
 Some examples suggest that the theme of ambiguous belief and the experience of psychosis may be characterized by a disorder characterized by emotion, and affect the symptoms of how a person interprets their experiences
 isaki haniyon ko dur rakhane ke liye "surakshit aadaton" kaa upyog isaki abhaason ke kram main sahaayak hota he
 Examples of the role of the psychological system come forward on the effect of therapies on the symptoms of schizophrenia
 mastishk kii karypranali main kriyaatmak bhinnataaon ke pareekshan ke liye tantrikeey manovaigyanik jaancho or mastishk pratirupan takneekon jaise fmri or PET dwaara kiye gaye adhyayanon se yah pataa chalaa he ki bhinnataayen adhiktar lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag, hippocampus or canapati ke hisson main paayi jaati hai
 These differences have been linked to neurocognitive cognitive impairments that are often considered insane / psychiatric
 mastishk ke mijolimbik maarg main dopamine kii karypranali par vishesh rup se dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya he
 a major reason for doing this is the finding of results from incidental studies that a group of drugs, which block the functioning of dopamine and known as phenothiazines, may reduce psychiatric symptoms
 is avadharana kii pushti is tathy bhi hoti he ki amphetamins, jo dopamine ke straav ko yaati he, sizophrenia kii sthiti main yah manorog ke lakshanon ko bigaad sakati he
 a dominant concept, also known as the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, states that over-activation of D2 receptors causes schizophrenia
 yadhyapi, sabhi manorog pratirodhi prabhaavon main aam, D2 avrodh ke aadhaar par 20 varshon tak yahi mana gaya jab tak ki 1990 ke daa ke madhya main PET or SPET pratirupan ke adhyayanon ne samarthak pramaan nahin die
 This interpretation is now considered to be extremely common, as one of the newer psychiatric resistant treatments is as effective as the old one, but it also affects the functioning of cirrotonin and may possibly have a slightly lower dopamine inhibitory effect
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main neurotransmeter glutamet or NMDA glutamet abhigraahak ke ghataae gaye prabhaav par bhi dhyaan diya gaya he
 This concept is also supported by the unusually low levels of glutamate receptors found in posthumous brain testing of people who were previously treated for schizophrenia 199, as well as the discovery that glutamate inhibitory drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine Can simulate symptoms and cognitive problems associated with these situations
 yah tathy ki glutamet abhigraahak ke kam prabhavali hone kaa matlab he lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag or hippocample kii karypranali kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye janevaale jaanchon kaa sateek naa hona or yah ki glutamet dopamine kii karypranali ko prabhavit karata he, in sabhi ko sizophrenia main bhamil kiya gaya he, jinke chizophrenia main glutamet margon kii bhoomika main ek mahatvapurn madhyasth hone kaa pataa chalata he
 However, in the case of positive symptoms, glutamatergic treatment fails
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main mastishk ke kuch vishesh kshetron kii sanrachana or aakaar main bhinnataaon ke aadhaar par parinaamon main bhinnta dekhi jaati he
 Analysis of MRI studies in 2006 showed that for the first time patients with psychiatric symptoms had decreased overall brain and hippocampal volume, and that ventricular volume had increased, compared to patients with healthy controls
 haalanki, in adhyayanon ke anusaar wolum main ausat badlaav MRI ke tareekon dwaara tay kii gayi maapan seemaa ke najadik he, isliye yah tay karnaa bhosh rah jaataa he ki sizophrenia ek tantrikana prakriya he jo us samay bhaaru hoti he jab iske lakshan dikhaai padate hai, yaa yah ki ise ek aisi tantrikeey vikaas kii prakriya samajhnaa behatar he, jisamen kam umr main hi mastishk kii asaamaanya maatra taiyaar ho jaati he
 The psychoses of the first episode were associated with a significant reduction in psychiatric antidote drugs such as haloperidal, whereas the excessive decrease in gray matter volume was not associated with unusual psychiatric antidepressants such as olanzepine
 gairmanviya primets ke adhyayanon se pataa chalaa ki aadaar manorog pratirodhi dawaaon or asaamaanya manorog pratirodhi dawaaon, donon main grey or white matter main kami paayi gayi
 Analysis of diffusion tensor modeling studies in 2009 revealed two consecutive regions of fractional anisotropy reduction in schizophrenia
 One area was in the left frontal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, thalamus, and cingulate gyrus to the White Matter tract and the other area was in the temporal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, insula, hippocampus amygdala, temporal, and occipital lobe
 Went across the White Matter tract
 lekhak kaa kahana he ki sizophrenia main white matter tract ke do network prabhavit ho sakate hai, jisase un grey matter kshetron ke 'sampark tut jane' kii sambhaavna rahati he jinase ye jude hote hai
 During fmri studies, a deep correlation between brain default networks and taskpositive networks was observed in schizophrenia patients and may demonstrate a high degree of adaptation to attention to chronological observation and external observation
 adhik virdohi do network ke bich sahasambandh network ke bich atyadhik pratidwandvita pataa chalata he
 There are no reliable measurements for the advanced stages of schizophrenia, although the concomitance of both genetic factors as well as nonadolescent psychoses may provide a better estimate of how later treatment may continue
 aise vyakti jo 'atyadhik jokhimpurna maansik avasthaa' kii shrenee main aate hai, jinamein sizophrenia kii paariwarik prishrubhumi ke sathsath asthaayee yaa swaniyantrit manovikrutiyon ke lakshan bhamil hai, unamem ek vashar ke baad kii paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par ilaaj kii sambhaavna 2040 pratit tak hoti he
 The use of psychiatric treatments and drugs has been found to be far more effective in reducing the likelihood of individuals in the category of 'highly risky' than in patients with fully developed schizophrenia
 haalanki, manorog pratirodhi ilaajon ke dushprabhavon ke sandarbh main, un logon kaa ilaaj kahin adhik vivaadit he, jo kabhi sizophrenia kaa car nahin hue, vishkar disphigaring taradive diskinesia ke lakshanon vaale or durlabh parantu kahin adhik maarak neuroleptic mailinent syndrome vaale rogiyon main

 New medical thinking suggests that even early intervention in psychiatric conditions is a retrograde preventive measure to prevent later episodes and the long-term disability associated with schizophrenia
 is rog se mukti kii avadharana abhi tak vivaadit he, kyonki isaki paribhaasha par koi ekamat nahin he, haalanki lakshno ko dur karne ke liye kuch upaay haal hi main sujhaaye gaye hai
 Effective treatment of schizophrenia is often considered to be dependent on standard methods, one of the most common methods being the measurement of positive and negative symptoms
 lakshno kaa prabandhan or kaaryakshmata ko uyana, rogamukti kii tulana main kahin adhik prabhavi mana jaataa he
 Its treatment was discovered in the mid-1950s with the development and presentation of chlorpromazine

 Severe schizophrenia conditions may require hospitalization

 Due to changes in the recruitment process, it is no longer common for this to remain in the hospital for a long time, although it may need to be done

 There is a belief among many non-western communities that schizophrenia can only be treated in more informal, community-controlled ways

 New and unusual anti-psychotic drugs are commonly used for chronic abnormal psychosis, but they are expensive and are prone to weight gain and obesity-related diseases
 san 2008 main, yues nashnal institute of mental health dwaara kiye gaye aakasmik pareekshan ke parinaamon main ye paaya gaya, ki ek pratham peedhee ke pratinidhi swaroop paaya jane vaala manovikruti rodhi, paraphanjin, anek naveen dawaaon ke 18 maah kii maatra kii apeksha adhik prabhaavshaalee va kifayati he
 The most unusual psychotic patient wanted to continue, ie olanzhapine, had risks of weight gain and metabolic disturbances
 chlojhapin un marijon ke liye sabase zyada asarkaari tha jo anya dawaaon par koi pratikriya nahin dete the
 Since its trial did not take patients with Tardive dyskinesia, its effects on these types of people could not be ascertained

 This benefit was definitely given, but with obesity and metabolic rate disturbance due to which its use remained questionable for a long time
 khaskar bacchon or kishoron main sizophrenia hone par unhe davaaiyon ke saath hi paariwarik vyavhaar chikitsa bhi di jaani chaiye
 Current criticisms have rebutted the claim that abnormal antipsychotics have some additional pyramidal postoperative effects, especially if it is taken in small quantities or chosen as an anti-psychosis of low potency
 sizophrenia se peedit mahilaon main asaamaanya manovikruti rodhi istemaal karne par prolactin ilveshan kaa asar dekha gaya he

 Cognitive behavioral therapy is used for specific symptoms and is used to diagnose other symptoms such as self-esteem, social initiation and insight
 However, the results of prior tests did not reach any conclusion
 chunki ab ye therapy 1990 ke shishav kaal se ab tak kaaphi pragati kar chuki he, haal hi main hue kuch punarnirikshanon se ye maaloom hua he ki CBT kii chikitsa sizophrenia ke psycotic lakshanon par kargar hoti he
 Another type is Cognitive Remediation Therapy, a technique that is sometimes treated with neurocognitive deficiency present in schizophrenia

 Training of social work has produced both positive and negative results

 1970 ke prarambh main, sizophrenia ko lekar nidaan kii kasautiyaan anek vivaadon se bhari hui thi, unhi kaa upyog vartmaan sizophrenia ke mandandon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 It became clear after the 1971 US-UK Diagnostic Study that schizophrenia was seen more in the US than in Europe
 iske peeche kaaran tha US kaa nidaan maandand, yahaan par DSM-II manual kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he jabaki europe main ICD-9 kaa

 These included some factors related to the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but due to the complete DSM manual, the DSM-III was republished in 1980
 sizophrenia shabd kaa galat arth saadharantah ye le liya jaataa he ki peedit vyakti main vibhajit vyaktitv he

 ek internet protocol adress ek sankhyatmak label he jo apane nodes ke bich sanchaar ke liye internet protocol kaa prayog karanevaale computer network main bhaag le rahe divices ko abantit kiya jaataa he
 An IP address performs two major functions: host or network interface identification and location detection
 The characterization of its role is as follows: “A name indicates what we ask for
 ek pataa ingit karata he ki vah kahan he
 a route indicates how to get there
 " TCP / IP ke diziner ne IP adress ko ek 32-bit nambar ke rup main paribhaashit kiya or internet protocal varjan 4 yaa ipv4 ke naam se jaani janevaali yah pranali, aaj bhi upyog main he
 However, due to the extensive development of the Internet and consequently the lack of available addresses, a new detection system using 128 bits for addresses was developed in 1995 and last standardized by RFC 2460 in 1998
 haalanki IP adress dwiadhari sankhya ke rup main jamaa kiye jate he, vah aamtaur par maanviya-pathyogy chihnkaree jaise 208
77
188
166 or 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:1:1 main pradarshit kiye jate hai
 The Internet protocol also sends data packets between networks; The IP address specifies the location of the source and destination nodes in the topology of the routing system
 is prayojan ke liye, ek IP adress ke kuch bits ek sab-network abhinihit karne ke liye istemaal kiye jate hai
 The number of these bits is indicated in CIDR notation, appended to the IP address, such as 208
77

166 / 24
 jaise hi nijee network ke vikaas ne ipv4 adress ke samaapan ke khatre ko uthaaya, RFC 1918 ne nijee adress sthaan kaa ek samooh nirdhaarit kiya jo nijee network par kisi ke bhi dwaara istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 They are often used with network address translators to connect to the global public Internet
 da internet asind number athurity, jo saarvbhaumik IP adress sthaan niyatan prabandh karata he, sthaneey internet registry or anya sansthaaon ko IP khand aabantan karne ke liye, paanch kshetreey internet registry ko sahyog detaa he
 Two versions of the Internet protocol are in use: IP version 4 and IP version 6
 See version history
) Each version defines an IP address differently
 uski vyapaktaa ke kaaran, saamaanya shabd ypi adress aam taur par ab bhi ipv4 dwaara paribhaashit adress ko sanderbhit karata he
 ipv4 uses a 32-bit address, which limits the address space to 4,294,967,296) possible unique addresses
 ipv4 kuch adress, vishesh prayojanon jaise nijee network yaa bahustrpiya adress ke liye arakshit karata he
 This reduces the number of addresses to be assigned to end-users and as the number of available addresses decays, ipv4 address completion becomes fixed
 yah purvaabhaasi kami ipv6 viksit karne ke liye praathmik prerana thi, jo duniya bhar main vibhinn tainaati charnon main he or ipv4 pratisthaapan or internet ke lagaataar vistaar ke liye akeli ranneeti he
 ipv4 addresses are usually represented in dot-decimal notation
 prayek bhaag adress ke 8 bit kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or isliye ocotate kahalaaya jaataa he
 In less common cases of technical writing, ipv4 addresses can be presented in hexadecimal, octal, or binary representations
 sarvaadhik pratinidhitiv main prayek ocotate vyaktigat rup se badla jaataa he
 In the initial phase of Internet Protocol development, network administrators described the IP address in two parts, the network number portion and the host number portion
 The highest order octet in an address was designated a network number, and the remaining bits were called rest fields or host identifiers and were used for internal host numbering of the network
 yah paddati jald hi annuroop sabit hui jaise hi atirikt network viksit hue jo maujuuda network se svachhand the, jinhen pehle se hi ek network sankhya dwaara abhinihit kiya hota tha
 In 1981, the Internet addressing specification was revised with the inclusion of a classful network structure
 classphul network dizine ek badi sankhya ke liye vyaktigat network kaary kii anumati detaa tha
 The first three bits of the most important octet of an IP address were defined as a range of addresses
 saarvbhaumik unicast parichayan ke liye teen shreneeyaan paribhaashit kii gai
 Network identification based on derived class was based on octet boundary areas of the entire address
 prayek shrenee network pahachanakarta main kramshah atirikt octate kaa upyog karti thi, is prakaar se ucch varg shrenee main sambhav mejabaanon kii sankhya kam ho jaati he
 The following table gives an overview of the system thus obsolete
 'sabanetwork' or 'classphul network' lekh main is abhikalp kaa vivaran samajhaayaa gaya he
 Although the classful network design was a successful developmental stage, wild Internet expansion made it difficult to move forward and when classless inter-domain routing was created to provide new IP address segments and use ipv4 addresses for routing protocols
 When new rules were prepared for, it was dropped
 swecchit-lambaai upsargon kaa aabantan evam anumaargan karwaane ke liye siidiar veriable-lenth sabanet masking par aadhaarit he
 Today, the residuals of the classful network concept operate only in a limited area, which is the default configuration parameter of some network software and hardware components and is used in technical discussions of network administrators
 aarambhik network abhikalp main jab sanchaar ke liye sabhi internet prayogkartaaon ke bich vaishvik str par ek chaur se duusare chaur tak jodne kii baat sochi gai to yah lakshya tha ki prayek computer yaa upkaran kaa ek vishisht ypi pataa ho
 But it was found that it is not always possible to do so as private networks developed and public addresses needed to be conserved
 jo computer internet se nahin jude hai, jaise ki kaarkaane kii mashine jo tisipi / ypi ke madhyam se keval aapas main sanchaar karti hai, unke liye vaishvik taur par vishisht ypi pataa hona jaruri nahin he
 For private networks three of the ipv4 addresses, one limit for each class, were reserved in the 1918 RFC
 in paton kaa margan internet par nahin kiya jaataa or isliye inkaa prayog ypi paton kii panji ke saath samanvit karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Today, when needed, such private networks usually connect to the Internet through network address translation
 koi bhi upyogkarta kisi bhi arakshit blaak kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Typically, a network administrator splits a segment into subnets, for example, many home enrollers automatically use a left address range of 192

 ypi sanskaran 4 pate kaa sthaan teji se apane aadhikarik taur par uplabdh abantit pate ke khandon ke samaapan par pahunch rahaa he
 Despite the preservation techniques, the rapid completion of the ipv4 address space prompted the Internet Engineering Task Force to explore new technologies to expand the Internet's addressing capabilities
 iskaa sthaayee samaadhaan, internet protocol kaa hi ek nayaa swaroop, samajha tha
 This next generation of Internet Protocol, intended to replace ipv4 on the Internet, was eventually renamed Internet Protocol version 6 in 1995
 pataa aakaar 32 se badha kar 128 bit yaa 16 ocotate kar diya gaya, jo, network block ke ek udaar kaam ke saath bhi, nikat bhavishya ke liye paryaapt mana jaataa he
 Mathematically, the new address space provides a capacity of up to 2, or approximately 3
403 × 10 unique addresses
 nayaa dizin keval adress kii paryaapt maatra pradaan karne ke lakshya par aadhaar nahin he, balki sabanet anumaargan upsargon ke kushal ekatrikaran ko anumaargan nodes par hone kii anumati dene ke liye
 As a result, the routing table size is small and the smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 264 hosts, which is square of the size of the entire ipv4 Internet
 in staron par, vaastavik adress upyog dar kisi bhi ipv6 network khand par chota hoga
 The new design also provides the opportunity to isolate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment — which is the local administration of the segment's available space — from an addressing prefix used to route external traffic to a network
 ipv6 main aisi suvidhaayen he jo, yadi vaishvik sampark yaa anumaargan niti main parivartan ho, to bina aantarik nae swaroop yaa nae sankhyankan ke swatah hi puure network kaa anumaargan upsarg badal detii hai
 The large number of ipv6 addresses allows large blocks to be specified for specific purposes and, where appropriate, to be aggregated for efficient routing
 ek bade adress sthaan ke saath ek jatil pataa sangrakshan takanic kii jarurat nahin hoti, jaise clasles inter-domen rooting main upyog kii jaati he
 According to Submodern, desktop and enterprise server operating systems include seamless support for the ipv6 protocol, but are not yet widely deployed in other devices such as home networking routers, voice over internet protocols, and multimedia devices and network peripherals
 ek ipv6 pate kaa udhaaharan: As ipv4 reserves addresses for private or internal networks, ipv6 has separate sets of addresses for private addresses
 ipv6 main, in ko unic local adress ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 RFC 4,193 sets the routing prefix fc00 :: / 7 separately for this department, which is divided into two / 8 departments with different available policies
 The address includes a 40-bit pseudorandom number of site mergers or packets
 Addresses on the wrong route reduce the risk of encounter
 aarambhik dizin is prayojan ke liye ek alag khand kaa prayog karte the, dabd site-sthaneey adress
 haalanki, site kaa gathan kis se hota he, isaki paribhaasha aspasht rahi or kharaab paribhaashit parichayan niti ne anumaargan main sandigdhta bana di
 The address range specification has been abandoned and should no longer be used in the new system
 fe80 se shuru hote pate: - link-local adress kahalaaye jane vaale - keval sthaneey link kshetra main niyat kiye jate hai
 Addresses are usually generated automatically by the IP layer of the operating system for each network interface
 yah kisi bhi ipv6 mejabaan ke liye tatkaal swat: network sanyojaktaa pradaan karata he or iskaa matlab he ki yadi kai mejabaan ek aam hub yaa switch se judate hai to unke link sthaneey ipv6 adress dwaara unhen ek sheeghra sanchaar maarg miltaa he
 This feature is used extensively and indirectly for most users in the lower layers of ipv6 network administration
 saarvajanik internet main koi bhi nijee adress upsarg nahin bheja ja saktaa
 The technique of subnetting can work in both ipv4 and ipv6 networks
 ypi adress do bhaagon main vibhajit he: network adress or host idantifire 
 sabanet mask yaa CIDR upsarg nirdhaarit karata he ki kaise IP adress network or host bhaagon main vibhajit he
 The term subnet mask is only used in ipv4
 halanki donon ypi sanskaran, classles inter-domen rooting kii avadharana or sanketan kaa upyog karte hai
 In this, there is a slash behind the IP address and the number of bits used for the network part, also called the route prefix
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek ipv4 adress or uskaa sabanet mask kramshah 192
0
2
1 or 255
255
255
0 ho saktaa he
 The CIDR notation for the same IP address and subnet mask is 192

1 / 24, as the first 24 bits of the IP address encode the network and subnet
 jab ek computer har baar ek hi ai pi adress kaa prayog karne ke liye samanurup kiya jaataa he to vah tej ho jaataa he, ise static IP adress kehete hai
 Conversely, in cases when the computer's IP address is assigned automatically, it is known as a dynamic IP address
 static IP adress ek vyavasthaapak dwaara haath se computer ko saunpa he
 Its exact process varies by platform
 yah dinemic ai pi adress se asaadrishy hai, jo yaa to computer interphes yaa swayam host software, jaise xeronkonf main, dwaara nirdisht hote he yaa dinemic host kanfigreshna protocol ke istemaal se ek sarwar dwaara nirdisht kiye hote he
 Although IP addresses specified using DHCP remain the same for long periods of time, they can usually change
 kuch maamalon main, ek network vyavasthaapak sakriy rup se nirdisht static IP adress lagu kar saktaa hai
 In this case, a DHCP server is used, but it is specifically tailored to always assign the same IP address to a specific computer
 yah static IP adress ko mukhya rup se samanurup hone kii anumati detaa he, jisamen network par prayek computer ko hastchalit pranali dwaara vishesh rup se samanurup karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 In the absence or failure of a static or stateful address configuration, an operational system can assign an IP address to a network interface using state-less automatic-configuration techniques, such as Xeroconf
 gatisheel ypi pate dinemic host kanfigareshan protocol sarvaron dwaara atyadhik praayah lans or broadband network par niyukt hote hai
 They are used because they can avoid the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses for each device on a network
 yah kai upkarnon ko ek network par simit adress sthaan main sahabhaagi banane kii anumati bhi detaa he, par keval yadi un main se kuch kisi vishesh samay par online hon
 kai vartmaan desktop oparating system main, gatisheel ypi vinyas difolt rup se sakasham kiya hota he taaki ek upyogkarta ko DHCP sarwar ke saath ek network se judane ke liye apane haath se koi settings darj karne kii aavashyaktaa naa pade
 gatisheel IP adress nirdisht karne ke liye DHCP hi akeli takanic nahin he
 Dialup and some broadband networks use dynamic address characteristics of point-to-point protocols
 ek stick dinemic IP adress yaa stick ypi cabel or DSL internet adhigam bhugtankarta dwaara ek gatyaatmakataa se niyukt ypi adress jisamen aksar badlaav nahin aata, uskaa varnan karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Addresses are usually assigned with the DHCP protocol
 chunki modem aamtaur par vistaarit avadhi ke samay ke liye yantrachaalit hote hai, isliye adress patte aksar lambey samay ke liye niyamit kiye jate hai or samaapti hone par naveekrut kar die jate hai
 If a modem is turned off and the address is re-operated before the next termination of the lease, it is most likely that it will receive the same IP address
 RFC 3330 ipv4 networkon ke liye sthaneey-link adressing main vishesh upyog karne ke liye adress block, 169
254
0
0 / 16, paribhaashit karata he
 In ipv6, each interface using static or dynamic address functions automatically receives a local-link address in the fe80 :: / 10 subnet
 ye adress keval link par vaid hote hai, jaise ek sthaneey network khand yaa binduvaar conection jisase koi host judaa hua ho
 These addresses are not routable and cannot be the source or destination of Internet packet blocking like private addresses
 jab sthaneey-link ipv4 adress block arakshit hua tha, adress swachaalit-samakriti ke tantra ke liye koi bhi maanak astitv main nahin tha
 Filling the void, Microsoft created an implementation called automatic private IP addressing
 microsoft kii vipanan kshamta ke kaaran APIPA ko lakhon mashiinon par tainaat kiya gaya he or, is prakaar yah udyog main ek vaastavik maanak ban gaya he
 Many years later, the IETF defined a formal standard for this functionality, RFC 3927, as the official configuration of the local-link address ipv4
 kuch buniyadi dhaanchon ko sthitik adress upyog karnaa aavashyak he, jaise ki domen naam pranali kaa host praapt karne par jo domen naam ko IP adress main badal detaa he
 Static address is also convenient to set up a server in an enterprise, but not at all necessary
 DNS sarwar se praapt kiya gaya ek adress apane jeevankaal, yaa kaishing samay ke saath aata he, jiske baad isamen badlaav nahin aayaa, isaki pushti karne ke liye yah dekha janaa chahie
 Even static IP addresses change as a result of network management
 today ke anusaar internet par fyrwal aam hai
 For increased network security, they control access to private networks based on the customer's public IP
 kaali suchi prayog kar rahe ho yaa safed suchi, jo IP adress avaruddh hota he, vah graahak kaa kathith saarvajanik ypi adress hota he, matlab yadi graahak proxi sarwar yaa NAT istemaal kar rahaa ho to ek IP adress kaa avrodh karne se kai alag alag log avaruddh ho sakate hai
 Multiple client tools can be displayed to use an IP address: either because it is part of a shared hosting web server environment or because an ipv4 network address translator or proxy server acts as an intermediary on behalf of its clients In this case, the actual IP address generated may be hidden from the server receiving the request
 ek nijee network main NAT kaa ek badi sankhya main IP adress ko chhipaana ek aam kaary pranali he
 Only "external" interfaces of NAT require an Internet routable address
 sabase saamaanya net upkaran bahari ore TCP yaa UDP port sankhya maanchitr karte hai or bhitari bhaag main vyaktigat nijee adress ko
 Just as a telephone number may have a site-specific extension, port numbers are a site-specific extension for an IP address
 chote gharelu network main, NAT kaary aam taur par ek awasaiya pravesh-dwaar divaais main hote hai, vishisht rup se ek "router" ke rup main bechaa jaataa he
 In this scenario, the computer connected to the router will have a 'private' IP address and the router will have a government address to communicate with the Internet
 is prakaar kaa router, kai computer ko ek saarvajanik ai pi pataa baantne kii anumati detaa he
 In Windows the IP address can be determined using the command line tool ipconfig

 satyendra ne apane hi vibhaag ke kuch bhrasht adhikariyon or ejiniyaron ke khilaaf kaarywahi kii or unhen nilambit kiya
 After this Satyendra started a campaign against corruption and also focused on other irregularities happening in his department
 unhone in aniyamittaaon ke bare main apane vibhaag ke nideshak or anya adhikariyon ko patr bhi likhaa lekin kisi ne bhi unki baton par dhyaan nahin diya
 As a result of these complaints, they were transferred to Gaya district

 Satyendra's assassination created a political and social upheaval
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf kaam karne vaali anya sansthaaon ne is maamle ko uthaaya
 As a result, the government had to formulate a rule to protect the identity of people exposed to corruption at the policy level

 The Right to Information Act which came in later years proved to be a milestone in this direction

 The French Revolution was a period of political and social upheaval and radical changes in the history of France that lasted from 1789 to 1799
 baad main, nepolian bonapart ne francisi samrajya ke vistaar dwaara kuch ansh tak is kranti ko aage badhaayaa
 As a result of the revolution, the king was removed from the throne, a republic was established, bloody conflicts took place, and finally the dictatorship of Napoleon was established, which spread many values of this revolution in and outside Western Europe
 is kranti ne aadhunik itihaas kii disha badal di
 This led to the decline of the absolute monarchy around the world, new republics and liberal democracies
 aadhunik yug main jin mahaparivartanon ne paashchaatya sabhyataa ko hilaa diya usamen france kii rajyakranti sarvaadhik naatakeey or jatil sabit hui
 This revolution disrupted the life of not only France but the whole of Europe
 francisi kranti ko puure vishwa ke itihaas main mile kaa pathar kaha jaataa he
 This revolution also led to freedom in other European countries and other countries also started fighting for freedom from the monarchy
 isane europea rashtron sahit asian deshon main rajshahi or nirankushta ke khilaaf vaataavaran taiyaar kiya
 France had an autocratic monarchy based on the divine principle of kingship
 isamen raja ko aseemit adhikaar praapt the or raja swechhachari tha
 In the reign of Louis the 14th, autocracy was at its zenith
 usne kaha- "main hi rajya hoon"
 He made laws against his will
 usne shakti kaa atyadhik kendriyakaran rajtantr ke paksh main kar diya
 France expanded by diplomacy and military prowess
 is tarah usne rajtantr ko gambhir pesha banaaya
 The governance that Louis 14th centralized required a worthy king, but his successors Louis 15th and Louis 16th were completely inept
 lui 15waan atyant vilaasi, adoordarshee or niskriy shaasha tha
 Participated in Austria's succession war and the Seven Year War caused great damage to the country's economic condition
 iske baavjood bhi varsay kaa mahal vilasita kaa kendra bana rahaa
 He said that after me there will be holocaust
 kranti kii purv sandhya par lui 16wein kaa shaasha tha
 He was an indolent and unworthy ruler
 usne bhi swechhachaarit or nirankushta kaa pradarshan kiya
 He said that "this thing is legal because i want it
" " apane ek mantri ke tyaagptr ke samay usne kaha ki-kaash! main bhi tyaagptr de paata
 His wife Mary Antoniet had a great influence on him
 vah phijulkharchi karti thi
 He had no understanding of the troubles of the common man
 ek baar jab logon kaa juluus roti kii maang kar rahaa tha to usne salaah di ki yadi roti uplabdh nahin he to log kek kyon nahin khate
 In this way the governance system of the country was completely dependent on bureaucracy
 jo vanshanugat thi
 There were no rules for their recruitment and training and there was no institution that could control these bureaucrats
 is tarah shashan pranali puri tarah bhrasht, nirankush, niskriy or shoshankari thi
 The law of personal law and the will of the king applied
 faltah desh main ek samaan kanoon samhita kaa abhaav tathaa vibhinn kshetron main vibhinn kanoonon kaa prachlan tha
 Due to this chaotic and complicated law, the public did not have knowledge of their own law
 is avyavasthit nirankush tathaa samvedansheel shashan tantra kaa astitv janata ke liye kshtdaayi ban gaya
 These oppressive political circumstances gave way to revolution
 france kii arajakpurna sthiti ke baaren main you kaha ja saktaa he ki "buree vyavastha kaa to koi prashn nahin, koi vyavastha hi nahin thi
 " kranti ke kaarnon ko saamaajik paristhitiyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 French society was heterogeneous and disintegrated
 vah samaaj teen virgon / stats main vibhakt tha
 The clergy in the first states, the nobility in the second states and the general public in the third states
 padri evam kuleen varg ko vyapak visheshadhikaar praapt tha jabaki jansadharan adhikaar viheen tha
 The number of farmers was the highest and their condition was low and thoughtful
 kisaanon ko rajya, carch tathaa anya jamidaaron ko anek prakaar ke kar dene padate the or saamanti atyaachaari ko sahanaa padataa tha
 In a sense, the main reason for the dissatisfaction of the farmers was the hardships and inconveniences being given by the feudal lords and the monarchy was silent on it
 is tarah kisaan itane duhkhi ho chuke the ki ve swayan hi ek krantikari tatv ke rup main parinat ho gaye or unhen kranti karne ke liye maatr ek sanket kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The middle class consisted of moneylender merchants, teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers, artists, employees etc
 unki aarthik dasha main avashya thik thi phir bhi ve tatkaaleen raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik paristhitiyon ke prati acroshit the
 This class had no political authority and the behavior of the clergy and the nobility was not good towards them
 is kaaran madhyavarg kulinon ke saamaajik shreshthata se ghrinaa rakhte tha or raajnneetik vyavastha main parivartan kar apane adhikaron ko praapt karne ke icchhuk tha
 This was the reason that he was the main contributor to the French Revolution and he led the revolution
 madhyavarg ke kuch aarthik shikaayatein bhi thi
 Due to the erstwhile commerce trade, this class had acquired wealth, but now in the feudal environment, there were many restrictions on their trade and had to pay tax in place
 ve apane vyapaar vyavsaay ke liye unmukt vaataavaran chaahate the
 For this, he led the revolution
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki france kii kranti francisi samaaj ke do paraspar virdohi guton ke sangharsh kaa parinaam thi
 On the one hand there were influential groups from the political point of view and on the other side from the economic point of view
 desh kii raajnneeti or sarkaar par prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye in donon virgon main sangharsh anivaary tha
 Thus the French Revolution of 1789 was a struggle against inequality in French society
 france kii aarthik avasthaa sankatagrast thi
 The state was on the verge of bankruptcy
 vastutah france ke raajaaon kii phijulkharchi tathaa lui 14wein ke lagaataar yudhon ke kaaran shahi kosh khaali ho gaya tha
 After his death, Louis 15th participated in the Austrian succession war and the Seven Year War, which further increased the burden on the treasury and eventually Louis 16th made France's economic condition worse by participating in the American War of Independence
 samraat, samraji or unke parivaar par rajya kii atyadhik raashi kharch kii jaati thi
 The palace of Versailles became a means of looting the treasury
 duusari taraf kar pranali asantoshjanak thi
 Due to privileges, the rich class was exempt from tax and the poor farmer who was economically poor was the only taxpayer
 is tarah rajkosh kii sthiti atyant sochneey ho gai thi
 In France, the government fixed income according to expenditure rather than spending according to income
 rajya rin ke boj tale dabta gaya
 Whether France was unable to pay the interest of the principal money means that the state had reached a state of bankruptcy
 desh kii aarthik durvyavastha ko vyapaar vaanijya ko protsaahan dekar sudhara ja saktaa tha parantu sarkaar kii vaanijya niti itani aniyantrit evam doshapurn thi ki usase rajya main utpaadan evam vyapaar kaa vikaas sambhav nahin tha
 Louis 16th tried to overcome the economic crisis through financial advisors like the Turks, Necker but these reform efforts could not be implemented because the privileged class did not accept the taxation on themselves

 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom
 isi sadanrbh main usne “shakti ke pruthakkaran” kaa siddhanth diya jiske anusaar shashan ke teen pramukh ang-karypalika, nyaaypalik or vyavasthapika ko alag-alag haathon main rakhane kii salaah di
 He described the Government of England as ideal because there was a constitutional monarchy whereby the citizens were at liberty there
 is prakaar montescue ne shakti ke pruthakkaran ke madhyam se france kii nirankush raaj vyavastha par chot kii uske ye vichaar itane lokapriy hue ki 'da spirit of laaj' ke teen varshon main chah sanskaran prakashit hue
 It is to be noted here that Montescue neither talked of revolution nor to abolish the monarchy, he just exposed the defects of autocratic monarchy and talked about constitutional monarchy
 waltare ne apni pustakon ke letters on inglish madhyam se britain kii udaar raajnneeti, dharm or vichaar swatantraaa kaa vishad chithran kiya tathaa puraatan francisi vyavastha se uski tulana kii or france main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kamiyon kaa ullekh kiya
 These books became very popular before being banned
 “waltare” ne carch ke bhrasht achaaran, ashishnutaa, anyaay, daman or atyaachaar ke virodh main likhaa
 Pointing fingers at the corruption of the church, he wrote that there is no Christian left because there was only one Christian and he was crucified
 usne likhaa ki kukhyat evam badnaam cheez ko kuchal do
 This was clearly an attack on the tyrannical monarchy of France and the tyranny of the Church
 waltare england ke sanvaidhanik rajtantr ke anuroop hi france main bhi vaisaa hi shashan sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 He said that i prefer the rule of one lion in place of hundred mice

 He exposed the evils of the ancient French system
 usne logon ke samaksh tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kaa aaina prastut kiya or yah bataaya ki aaina main daag kaha he
 Russo talked about the freedom of man through his book "emily", "social Contract", "rusoni"
 isane kaha ki manushya swatantrat paidaa hote hue bhi sarvatra zanjeeron se jakadaaa hua
 The only way to get rid of these chains is to return to the natural primitive state
 ruson ne kaha ki samuhik ichha se bane rajya kaa yah anivaary tathaa saarvbhaum kartavya he ki vah saare samaaj ko sarvopari maanate hue kaary ko sanchalit karen
 The people who have been entrusted with executive power are the executive, not the owner of the people, and their duty is to obey the orders of the people
 is tarah uskaa drudh vishwaas tha ki sarvopari satta janata ke haath main honi chahie kisi kisi ek vyakti yaa sanstha ke haath main nahin
 Sovereign power is rooted in the will of the people which is called "common will"
 rajya ke kanoon ko isi saamaanya ichha kii abhivyakti honi chahie lekin kanoon kaa swaroop aisa nahin rah gaya he, balki yah shaasha kii ichha par nirbhar rahane laga he
 The Russians also did not talk of revolution but considered all people as free and equal and the slogans of the French Revolution were influenced by his ideas of freedom, equality and fraternity
 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year
 18veen shatabdi ke shreshth vichaarkon kii rachanaaon ko sankalit kar aam janata tak pahunchane kaa shrey francisi vidwaan didaro ko diya jaataa he isane ek gyaan kosh kaa prakaashan kiya
 In this, evils of governance, corruption of the church and inequality prevailing in every field were highlighted
 france kii sarkaar ne didaron ko apana ghor shatru mana or uski pustak par anek pratibandh lagaae
 a section of thinkers was focused on the economic disorder and analysis prevailing in France at this time
 in arthshaastriyon ko “phisyokrat” ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Prominent among them were the Turgans, the Quessanes, the Mirabs, etc
 quesane mukt vyapaar kaa samarthak tha

 The American War of Independence stamped on the bankruptcy of France
 atah aarthik duravastha ko dur karne ke kram main turgon, nekar, colon jaise arthshaastriyon kii madad lee

 The nobles hoped that in this meeting they would be able to obtain the privileges which were taken away at the time of Louis 14th
 madhyavarg ke logon kaa manaan tha ki ve apane paksh main pragatisheel nitiyon kaa nirdhaaran karvaa sakenge
 The farmers hoped that by raising their voice against feudal privileges, they would be able to secure their rights and be free from their exploitation cycle
 is tarah francisi rajtantr kaa samarthan karne ke liye francisi jansankhya kaa koi mahatvapurn bhaag taiyaar nahin tha
 In the session of the Estates General, there was a dispute between the third state and other states on the issue of voting system
 matdaan ke bare main kaha gaya ki prayek state kaa ek hi mat mana jayega
 In this way, the privileged class has two and the public has only one opinion
 jansadharan ke pratinidhiyon ne arthath 'tritiy state' ne is matdaan pranali kaa virodh kiya kyonki isse ve bahut main hote hue bhi alpamat main aa jate
 The third state wanted the representatives of the three categories to sit together and decide by majority, but the clergy and the elite wanted separate meetings
 atah tritiy state ne stats general kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kar apane ko samast raashtra kaa pratinidhi maanate hue rashtriya sabha ke rup main ghoshit kar diya or paas ke tennis court main apni sabha bulaai
 The French Revolution reached its end through various stages
 adhyayan kii suvidha kii drushti se kranti ko nimnlikhit chaar charnon main baantkar dekha ja saktaa he
 At this stage the Parisian mob established control of the Bastille fort
 is tarah kranti kii shuruuaat hui
 In fact, the Bastille fort was a symbol of tyranny and tyranny and its fall posed a deep challenge to the archaic system
 is ghatana kaa prabhaav france ke gramin kshetron main bhi padaa or graminon ne saamanti karon ke abhilekhon ko aag laga di
 These proceedings of the public also had a profound impact on the National Assembly
 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights
 in adhikaron main swatantraaa, sampatti suraksha tathaa atyaachaar ke virodh kaa adhikaar aadi shaamil the
 In this way, the Constituent Assembly declared the fundamental principles, freedom, equality and dominance of the people
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko ghoshnaa patr main baar-baar duharaaya gaya
 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people
 yadhyapi shashan pranali rajtantratmak bani raheen parantu raja ke adhikaron ko simit kiya gaya
 He is no longer a lawmaker
 raja ko kisi desh se yuddh yaa sandhi karne kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 The authority to legislate was given to an assembly and its members numbered 745
 vyavasthapika ke sadasyon ke nirvachan ke liye nagarikon ko sakriy or nishkray do bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya gaya or matadhikaar keval sakriy nagarikon ko diya gaya
 Active citizens were those over the age of 25 who paid the state direct tax equal to three days' income while inactive citizens were those who were poor

 The entire country was divided into 83 departments by abolishing the ancient provinces
 in departmenton ko Cantan or Comune main baanta gaya
 There was an Election Council to run the rule of each of the units, which were elected by active citizens
 is tarah sthaneey str se lekar kendriya str tak sari rajya vyavastha bargea varg main aa gai
 After the dissolution of the National Assembly, in 1791 AD, a 745-member administrative body came into existence
 is vyavasthapika sabha main adhyaksh ke daahine haath kii ore baithne vaale 'dakshinpanthi' kehalaae
 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this
 jacobiyan anushaasit or sangathit the
 He had influence on the Parisian crowd
 isamen pramukh netaa the- dante, robspier, heater aadi
 On the other side there were jirondists - these were educated and cultured people
 inhen kitaabi gyaan adhik tha
 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers
 antar keval swaroop kaa tha
 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality
 ve swatantraaa par adhik jor dete the
 On the other hand, the Jacobians put more emphasis on equality and a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army took over Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control
 in vijayon se holland, austria, prasha or england ghabara gaye
 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places
 faltah videshi yuddh main france kii paraajay neshnal kanveshan ke samaksh ek mukhya samasya ban gai
 The National Convention passed a resolution that abolished the monarchy and established the republic
 raja par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or mrityudand kii sajaa di gai
 The policy of the Jirendistas on the question of the slaughter of the king was not clear
 ve rajtantr ke virdohi to the lekin vadh ke prashn par janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahe the
 In contrast, the Jacobians believed that the king's treason had been proved
 atah use mrityudand diya janaa chahie
 Finally, on 16 January 1793, Louis 16th was hanged
 neshnal kanvension ko jacobiyan or jirodishton ke bich sangharsh kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, France was beset by an economic crisis due to war, with prices soaring that the Convention enacted legislation to provide relief, a rule to collect debt from the rich

 When Jacobio invaded the Convention with the help of the Paris mob and the commune, he took power and arrested Jirondisto and established a state of terror
 'aatank ke rajya' kii sthapana ke saath hi france ek baar punah avyavashtha kaa shikaar hua
 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians

 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed

 The rights of all the members of the board were equal
 prayek sadsy baari-baari se teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh hua karte the
 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France
 sanchaalak mandal ke saamne sabase pramukh samasya thi yuddh kii samasya, duusari taraf diarectory ke sadsy anubhavheen, ayogy tathaa bhrasht the
 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i

 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution

 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property

 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
 kranti ke dauraan krantikariyon ne nirankush sarkaar dwaara liye gaye rinon kii baat to kii kintu un rinon ko maaf karne kii baat kisi ne nahin kii
 The reason was that this loan was given to the government by the bourgeoisie
 isi prakaar sarkaar ne carch kii sampatti ko to jabt kiya parantu use bhoomihinon ko nahin baanta gaya
 The lands were sold at the highest prices and the middle class had the ability to buy this land
 francisi kranti ne mazdooron ke hiton ko najrandaaj kiya or shramik andolan ko hatotsahit kiya
 The working class played an important role during the revolution, but the bourgeois leadership did not approve of its growing position
 atah neshnal asembli ne nirankush rajtantr yug main nirmit kanoonon ko punah lagu kar diya
 Due to which all trade union related works were banned and guilds were declared illegal
 neshnal essembali main burjuaon kii pradhanta thi or usamen jirondist or jacobiyan bhi burjua varg se sambandhit the
 Although the Jacobians spoke of the interests of the proletariat, the establishment of a state of terror kept bourgeois interests above and army's help was taken to suppress the workers' reactions
 diarectory ke shashan main bhi madhyavargeey hiton ko pramukhataa di gai
 All members of the bicameral legislature that the governing board created were middle-class intellectuals
 nepolian ke sudhaaron par bhi burjuai prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 He protected the right to property in his code of law, preserving bourgeois interests, giving relatively broad rights to the nobles and the middle class benefited from its commercial and commercial reforms
 is tarah kranti ke swaroop main madhyavargeey tatv dikhaai dete hai
 But from the analysis of the entire revolution and its impact, it is clear that in the revolution there was co-existence of farmers, laborers, women with middle class elements
 is tareeke se yah maatr madhyavargeey kranti nahin thi apitu ek lokapriy kranti ke rup main ise dekha ja saktaa he
 The French Revolution took on a worldwide character
 krantikariyon ne 1789 main manushya tathaa naagarik adhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii, jiske tahat kaha gaya ki janm se samaan paidaa hone ke kaaran sabhi manushyon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie or yah sabhi deshon ke liye sabhi manushyon ke liye, sabhi samay ke liye or udhaaharan swaroop sari duniya ke liye hai
 This declaration was made not just for France but for the good of all people everywhere who wanted to be independent and to be free from the burden of autocratic monarchy and feudal privileges
 neshnal essembali dwaara 1792 i
 main compene naamak angeraj nayak ko francisi naagarik kii oopaadhi di gai or use neshnal kanvension kaa pratinidh bhi chunaa gaya
 Similarly, during the revolution, the idea was to expand the revolution to other countries of Europe to keep it stable and strong
 isamen ek aise yuddh kii kalpana kii gai jisamen francisi senaayen padosi deshon main pravesh kar vahaan ke sthaneey krantikariyon se milakar rajtantr ko apdasth kar ganatantron kii sthapana karti he
 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged
 dharm or raajnneeti ke pruthakkaran kaa mudda pehali baar is kranti ke dauraan uthaa
 State and politics were separated from religion
 vishwa itihaas main france kii rajya kranti ko vishisht mahatv praapt he yah maanav itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 In this, not only France, but also brought a priceless change in the life of Europe, in this, by destroying the feudal system that had been prevailing in the past, it gave way to modern democratic system
 rajtantr kii nirankushta samaapt hui or loktantric vaataavarna main logon ne chaiyn kii saans lee
 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
 or se dur karnaa chaahati thi
 Many philosophers and writers were born there who drew the attention of people to these sufferings through their writings, in spite of the worsening situation of other European countries, there was first a revolution against Louis Solven in France
 is kranti ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Changed form of French feudalism and improved status of farmers francisi kisaanon kii unnat avasthaa or samantvaad kaa badla hua swarup aisa kaaran tha
 This led to the first state revolution in France
 europea desh ke kisaan abhi udaasi kii sthiti main the
 But the French peasants had become independent
 unke paas apni jameen apana makaan itani suvidha ke baavjud samant kar evam samant sevaaon kaa ant nahin hua tha unhen apni aamadani kaa bahut bada hissaa samant kar ke rup main chukaana padataa tha
 And still his position is good
 ve paise bachaakar kuch na- kuch jameen kharid liya karte the jameen kharidne kii bhukh nirantar badhati ja rahi thi isamen samant kar va berogari baadhak the at: ve samant peshon ko hataane kii baat soch rahe the at: madhyam varg ke netritv main unhe bal mila or 1789 i
 main unhone vidroh kar diya
 Lack of tradition of liberal autocracy in France- anya europea deshon main bhi nirankush rajtantr tha
 But the emperors there had reduced their autocracy over time
 prasha kaa raja fredirak apane samay kaa mahaan prabud prashaasak tha
 Other countries of Europe followed by Russia, Italy, Spain etc
 unhone samaynusaar jaataa kii aarthik bhautik tathaa anya kshetron main unnat karne kaa yatha sambhav prayaas kiya
 But France lacked such liberal autocracy
 vahaan ke raja janata kii bhalaai ke liye kuch nahin kar rahe the
 Rather, it became his policy to collect more taxes and exploit the public
 isliye france kii janata isse ub gai thi isliye france kii janata nirankush rajtantr ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi
 Awareness of medium france main hi sarvapratham kranti hone kaa kaaran vahaan kaa madhyamvarg tha
 Other countries also had a middle class but they were not as cultural, rich and educated as in France
 unamem shakti kaa abhaav tha
 They could not think of rebelling against the king
 france main madhyam varg ke log anek kaaran se apane samraaton se asantusht the
 And for his defense, the Raj was rash to curb the power
 anya europea rajyon main is tarah kii sthiti kaa abhaav tha
 There was no one to lead in other countries, there was a ready middle class in France
 at: sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Usefulness of noble class kuleen vahg ko pahase visheshadhikaar is liye diya gaya tha ki ve shashan chalaane main raja kii madad kare
 And they also protected Janata
 parantu dhire – 2 yah kaary raja ke karmchaaree karne laga
 As a result, the usefulness of the nobility ended
 phir bhi iske visheshadhikaar main kisi prakaar kii katautee nahin kii gai
 Hence the peasants and middle class people started hating the Kulinwarg
 anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 There still remained the father of the nobility
 darshanikon kaa prabhaav- In the 18th century, there was a chaotic movement throughout Europe
 darshanik, vichaarak, vaagyanik sabhi deshon main viddhman the
 But the main among them were the French thinkers
 jinhone kranti kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar prastut kiya
 He drew the attention of the people to the evils in the society and gave a voice to the people
 is tarah kaa prayaas anya deshon main nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 France was the only field of thinkers like Montague, Voltaire Russo
 austria, prasha or rus main is tarah ke vichaarak nahin the
 In other countries of Europe, there was no class of philosophers who gave their real status and created satisfaction in them
 france main hi kranti hone kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Lack of political participation england main jab madhyam varg ne jaagarukta ai to use desh kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar diya gaya
 But this was not the case with France
 france kaa madhyam varg apane samraaton se kaaphi asantusht tha
 They were expected
 shikshit hone ke baavjood unhen kulinon kii tarah pratishtha uplabdh nahin thi
 They were not given the opportunity to participate in French politics
 isliye unhone asantusht hokar kranti kaa naaraa buland kiya
 Ineligible king and corruption in administration- france kii rajanithik vyavastha kendrikrut thi lekin raja ayogy the
 The administration was dominated by corruption
 europe ke anya deshon main nirankush shashan totha parantu raja yogya the or shashan par unka purn niyantran tha
 The middle class of France was feeling this administrative corruption
 tathaa isliye vah vidroh karne ke liye taiyaar tha
 Rise of national spirit is samay europe main teji se rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai hone laga
 France was the only country in entire Europe where there was a complete lack of a national spirit
 iske chalate bhi sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Effect of American freedom struggle- 1766 i
 main american swatantraaa sangram prarambh hua
 The American people revolted against England
 france ke sainikon ko bhi is swatantraaa sangram main bhaag lene kaa avasar mila at: unhone yah mahasus kiya ki yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa prapti kii ja sakati he
 He also realized that freedom is possible only through freedom
 france lautne par unhone dekha kii jis swatantraaa ko liye unhonen america main yuddh kiya usee swatantraaa kaa france main purnat: abhaav he
 Hence, he became restless for the revolution here and tried to get freedom through war
 europe ke anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 Superiority of French Civilization france main hi kranti hone kaa ek vishisht kaaran yah tha ki yahan kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe rashtron kii apeksha adhik samrudh or vaibhav purna thi
 Even in terms of governance, the rule of France was highly organized
 france sampoorn europe sabhyataa or saanskriti kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Paris is considered the largest center of literature and thought in all of Europe
 france janamat anya europe rajyon kii apeksha adhik jaagrit or aalochanatmak tha
 As a result of all these reasons, in 1789 AD, there was revolution in France and not in other European states
