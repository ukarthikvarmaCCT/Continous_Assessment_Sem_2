 Today, there are a total of 16 states in the world outside which identify themselves as a homeland of Queen Elizabeth II
 angrezi bhashaa main british samprabhu ke adheen in rajyon ko aam taur par riyalm ke naam se janaa jaataa he, joki francisi shabd royum se liya gaya he, realm yani ek aisa rajya, kshetra yaa pradesh, jisapar ek raja / rani raaj karti he
 It is necessary to know here that "realm" is not a legal or legal term in the official terminology of the United Kingdom or Commonwealth or any Commonwealth Territory, that is, there is no legal definition of "realm"
 atah aisi koi baadhyataa nahin he kii british samprabhu ke adheen aanevaale in rajyon ko kisi vishesh naam se sambodhit kiya jaae, naahin "realm" shabd, ek rajya ke kisi vishesh darje ko paribhaashit karata he
 However, since the 1950s, the term "realm" has been used in authoritative documents to distinguish states under the British sovereign's rule from other member states of the Commonwealth, even the Queen Elizabeth's coronation This word was also used in the declaration of
 in rajyon ko realm isiilie kaha jaataa he, kyonki ek hi shaasha kii adheen hone ke baavjood ye saare rajya, purnatah saarvbhaumik hai, or ek-dusre se purnah swatantra hai, atah yah 16 desh, ek rajnatik ikai kaa hissaa nahin he, balki 16 alag-alag rajya hai
 Because realm is not a legal word, therefore no official translation of it is also present

 This thinking was developed during the feudalistic period in the Kingdom of England to address literal crowns and national estates by dividing them from the sovereign and his / her personal property
 is soch ke anusaar rajmukut ko prashasan ke samast angon tathaa har aayam main rajya tathaa shashan ke pratik ke rup main dekha jaataa he, tathaa british samprabhu ko rajmukut ke satat avatar ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Therefore, in Britain and the Commonwealth territories, this terminology is also used as an epithet for governance or government, or it may be said directly that this is another way of addressing the monarchy itself
 vidhik rup se "rajmukut" ko ek ekvyakti santhaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jo ki vidhanpalika, karypalika tathaa nyaaypalika ke sampurna samucch nyaayik avatar he
 Therefore, in this context the word should not be confused with the actual crown of any royal dress

 And the succession is publicly declared by the succession council
 atah angreji parampara ke anusaar shaasha ke uttaradhikaar ko vaid hone ke liye rajbhishek hona aavashyak nahin he
 So the coronation is usually a few months after the succession
 nae shaasha ke rajbhishek kii parampara westminster aibe main cantarbari ke archbishap dwaara kiya jaataa he

 1701 ke act of setlement ke vidhaanon ke anusaar, james pratham kii potee, hanover kii electress, sofia, ke "vaid" protostant vanshaj hi singhasana ko uttaradhikrut karne ke liye sakasham hai
 That is, only legitimate children of the royal family's dynasty hold succession over Singhasan, and none of the illegitimate children, and their descendants, have any right over Singhasan

 Some changes were made to the provisions of this Act by the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act
 is adhinium ke anusaar, uttaradhikaar kram ke pehle chah sadasyon ko vivaah karne hetu samprabhi kii ijazat lenaa aavashyak he, anyathaa us vyakti tathaa us vivaah se hue saare santan or unke vanshajon ko uttaradhikaar kram se vanchit maan liya jayega
 But any such marriage cannot be declared illegal in any way
 samprabhu ke parivaar ke sabase kareebi sadasyon ke samooh ko rajpariwaar kaha jaataa he
 However, there is no firm rule or legislation that regulates which individuals should be placed in this particular group, nor is there any legislation that defines the royalty in detail
 baharhaal, aam taur par un vyaktiyon ko jinpar hiz / har magesti yaa hiz / har royal hyness kaa sambodhan rakhte hai, ko aam taur par rajpariwaar kaa sadsy mana jaataa he
 The royal family, based on this criteria, included Adhirat, his / her companions, the widow / widower of the former sovereign, the offspring of the eldest son of the prince of Wales, and the siblings or widows of the sons of the former ruler and grandson of his male line
