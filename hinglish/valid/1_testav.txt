 chaahe vah 12 janvari ko sapa-basapa ke bich gathbandhan kaa mauka ho yaa phir mayawati ke janmdin kaa avasar
 On both occasions, Akash appeared with Mayawati
 sutron ke mutabik mayawati akaash ko aane vaale dinon main koi ahm jimmedaari bhi de sakati hai
 Earlier, Akash was also seen during Mayawati's visit during the Saharanpur violence
 uske baad se hi lagaataar kai baar vah raajnneetik mail-milaap ke maukey par bhi dekhe ja chuke hai
 Experts say that one of the major reasons for bringing Akash to the fore is that Mayawati wants to present Akash as a face to get Dalit youth closer to him
 isse pehle azamgarh ke rahane vaale raja ram ko mana ja rahaa tha ki vah mayawati ke uttaradhikari honge, kyonki 2014 main mayawati ne rajyasabha ke ummidavaar ke taur par raja ram kaa naam ghoshit kiya tha
 At the same time, Raja Ram was also the national vice-president and in-charge several times
 raja ram ke uttaradhikari banane kii bhi charchaa hui thi, kyonki 2007 main sarkaar banane ke baad mayawati ne manch se kaha tha unka raajnneetik uttaradhikari sajaateey unase kareeb 15 saal chota hoga
 But his family will not
 us samay raja ram ko lekar afvaah udi thi ki kahin mayawati raja ram ko hi apana uttaradhikari ghoshit nahin karne ja rahi hai
 However, now Akash's presence at every important moment makes it clear that Mayawati is fully preparing her nephew to enter the sea of politics
 bataa den ki shanivaar ko lakhanu main samaajawaadee party or bahujan samaaj party ne apni 23 saal kii dushmani bhulaakar saath aane kaa elaan kiya tha
 In order to defeat Modi in the Lok Sabha elections, the two parties will fight together in UP

 bataa den ki amethi se rahul gandhi or raibareli se sonia gandhi saansad hai
 At the same time, 2 seats have been left for the Rashtriya Lok Dal
 party netaaon kii baithak main mayawati ne karaayaa tha parichaybaspa party netaaon kii sitambar 2017 main ek baithak hui thi
 At that meeting, Mayawati first introduced Akash Anand to the party leaders
 mayawati ne party netaaon ke saamne apane bhai anand kumaar ko bulaayaa
 Akash Anand was also present with him

 Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath banned the killing of cow dynasty as soon as the government was formed in UP
 iske baad uttar pradesh main aawaara pashuon kii taadaad bad gai he jo kisaanon ke liye sirdard sabit hoti ja rahi he
 Aajtak examined aspects related to stray animals in a ground report
 purvi uttar pradesh ke phulpur tehsil ke ek chote gaanv main pahunchi 'ajtak' kii team ne dekha ki aawaara pashu gehun kii khadi fasal char rahe hai or kisaan in pashuon ko bhaga rahe hai
 a farmer, Bharelal said that the crop that he has planted through hard work is falling prey to stray animals
 bharelal ne kaha, 'kheti kii laagat pehle hi zyada ho gai he kyonki khaad, uria or daai kii keemten bad gai hai
 If the cattle farms are grazed from above, where will the farmer eat the bread? ”according to Bhare Lal, several thousand acres of fields in Phulpur area have been damaged
 khud inke 3 bighas main khadi fasal barbaad ho gai
 He told that after the animals climb the crop, fertilizer has to be applied again
 dobaaraa khet main mehnat kerani padati he or phir pashu use char jate hai
 Farmers like Bhare Lal are very angry with the Yogi government
 unka aarope he ki sarkaar ne na sirf khaad ke daam badaye balki kisaanon ko milane vaali khaad kii maatra bhi kam kar di
 Annoyed by the terror of stray animals, Bhare Lal says that Yogi and Mododi may have to bear the brunt of this in the next election
 kheti kii laagat badhane se kisaan naarajain maweshiyon kii dehshat itani he ki kisaanon ne apane kheton ke aasapaas contile taar lagane shuru kar die hai
 Obviously, the cost of farming is also increasing
 jo kisaan sakasham hai unke kheton kii fasal batch jaati he, jo kisaan garib hai unki fasal pashuon kaa shikaar ho rahi he
 Farmers are also offering farm animals in Prayagraj
 kisaan iske liye bijepi sarkaar ko chetavanee de rahe hai
 He says that ever since Yogi's government has been formed, farmers have been suffering more
 kisaan kehete hai ki din main mazdooree karke pet paalane ke bajaay kheton main rakhwali kerani pad rahi he
 More than day, animals are born at night
 prayagraj main rahane vaale nandlaal kehete hai ki pichley saal se yah samasya zyada bad gai
 30-40 animals are roaming the fields in each area and wandering in the fields in other areas after being driven from one place
 isse fasalein chaupat ho rahi hai
 Nandlal says that the first paddy crop was eaten by animals and now it is difficult to survive
 nandlaal ne 'ajtak' se kaha ki is puure ilaake main ek bhigaushalanhin banaai gai jahaan in maweshiyon ko rakhaa ja sake
 Nandlal also believes that the resentment of the farmers can be a major reason for the election defeat
 din main kaam, raat main nigaraneeaisi hi tasveerpratapgayamen bhi dikhaai padati he
 Wheat, potatoes, mustard and pea crops are cropping up, but farmers fear that stray animals will not leave them either
 aasapaas ke ilaakon main jangal he jahaan se in jaanwaron kaa jhund har roj apni bhukh mitaane kheton main pahunch jaataa he
 Pramila and Phoolkali are farmers of this small village in Pratapgarh
 pramila kahati hai ki raat-raat bhar chintaa main neend nahin aati
 Phoolkali says that the animals also ate their wheat crop, the animals did not leave the pea crop either
 in kisaanon kaa kahana he ki aasapaas ke duusare gaanv ke log apane pashu ek duusare ke gaanv main chhod aate hai
 The claims of building cowshed proved hollow here too
 pramila or phulkali bhi nahin jaanateen ki unke yahaan koi gaushala banaai gai he lekin yah jarur kehete hai ki kisaan apni naaraazgi chunaav main jarur dikhaaenge
 Phoolkali says that if farmers have problems then they will also vote against them
 log nahin chaahate ki govansh kii hatya ho lekin ye jarur chaahate hai ki yogi apana vaada puraa karen or ilaake main gaushalaayein banavaaen taaki unki fasal batch sake
 In order to not get too heavy, the stray farmers in the conversation with 'aaj Tak' put a barrage of allegations on the Yogi government
 aasapaas ke sarpanch jamaa hue to aawaara pashuon ko lekar unka dard saamne aayaa
 Farmers say that the cost of farmers to save animals is increasing
 duusari ore fasal kii keemat na milane se kisaan sirf ghaataa jhel rahaa he
 Farmers say that when there is no system of fodder, then how many cattle farmers will raise in such a situation
 kisaan chetavanee de rahe hai ki chunaav main kisaanon kii naaraazgi saamne aegi or iskaa asar gambhir dekhne ko milegaa
 Shivakant Ojha, a former MLA from Pratapgarh and Health Minister in Akhilesh Sarkar, says that a two-year-old Yogi government did not build a cowshed anywhere
 sapa netaa kaa daawa he ki kisaanon main iske chalate jo rosh he jiskaa khamiyaja bijepi ko 2019 ke chunaav main uthaanaa padegaa
 There is less than 100 days left in the start of Lok Sabha elections
 aise main uttar pradesh main kisaanon kii naaraazgi bijepi ke liye ek badi chintaa kaa sabab ban sakati he
 The speculation of a grand alliance of SP and BSP is already troubling Modi and Yogi
 aise main agar anndaata bhi bijepi se baagi ho gaya to 2019 main dilli kaa takht dur ho ho saktaa he

 An official said that the departments concerned are considering its potential and it is also being considered how effective this tax can actually be
