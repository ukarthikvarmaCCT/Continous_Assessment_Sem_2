 Ashfaq Ullah Khan was born on 22 October 1900 in Kadankhail Jalalnagar locality near the railway station in Shahjahanpur, Shahidgarh, Uttar Pradesh

 His mother, Mazhurunnisha Begum, was counted among the beautiful figures of Balam

 Many of them had also been appointed to the rank of Deputy Collector and SJM
 1857 ke gadar main un logon ne jab hindustan kaa saath nahin diya to janata ne gusse main aakar unki aaleeshaan kothi ko aag ke hawaale kar diya tha
 That Kothi is still famous as Jali Kothi throughout the city
 baharhaal ashfaaq ne apni kurabaani dekar nanihaal waalon ke naam par lage us badnuma daag ko hameshaa - hameshaa ke liye dho daalaa
 Ashfaq was the youngest of his siblings
 sab unhen pyaar se achchhu kehete the
 One day his elder brother Riyasat Ullah told Ashfaq about Bismil that he is a very capable and high-ranking poet, Goya is not seen in Shahjahanpur due to arrest in Mainpuri case
 kaaphi arse se faraar he khuda jane kahan or kin halaat main basar karata hoga
 Bismil is his best classmate
 ashfaaq tabhi se bismil se milane ke liye betaav ho gayi
 Time passed 1920 main aam muaafi ke baad ram prasad bismil apane vatan shahjahanpur aaye or gharelu kaarobaar main lag gayi
 Ashfaq tried to earn his trust by meeting Bismil many times but did not succeed
 chunaanche ek roj raat ko khannaut nadi ke kinare sunsaan jagah main meeting ho rahi thi ashfaaq vahaan ja pahunche
 When Ashfaq called Amen on a lion of Bismil, Bismil called him near and asked for introduction
 yah jaanakar ki ashfaaq unke classphelo riyasat ulla kaa sagaa chota bhai he or urdu jubaan kaa shaayar bhi he, bismil ne usase arya samaaj mandir main aakar alag se milane ko kaha
 Ashfaq went to the Arya Samaj even after refusing lakhs of his family members and became a active member of his party Matriwadi after a long chat with Ram Prasad Bismil
 yaheen se unki jindagi kaa nayaa falsafa shuru hua
 Along with the poets, they also became khadmatgars of the community
 ashfaaq bahut doordarshee the unhone ram prasad bismil ko yah salaah di ki krantikari gatividhiyaan ke saath-saath congress party main bhi apni paith banaakar rakhana hamaari kaamyavi main madadgaar hi sabit hoga
 However, along with Ashfaq and Bismil, many other youths of Shahjahanpur joined Congress and gave the party power
 1921 kii ahmedabad congress main ram prasad bismil va premakrishna khanna ke saath ashfaaq bhi shaamil hue
 In the session, he met Maulana Hasrat Mohani, who was considered among the senior martyrs of Congress
 moulana hasarat mohani dwaara prastut purna swaraj ke prastaav kaa jab gandhi ji ne virodh kiya to shahjahanpur ke congressi swayamsevakon ne gandhi kii dtakar mukhaalafat kii or khub hangaamaa machaaya
 Ultimately, Gandhiji had to accept the proposal even without wanting it
 isi prakaar disambar 1922 kii gaya congress main bhi navayuvakon dwaara gandhi kii jamkar khinchaayi kii gayi
 In this, the youth of Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh became one
 un sabakaa gandhi se ek hi sawaal tha- "aapane kisase poochkar asahyog aandolan waapas liya?" After the Congress of 1922, two parties were formed in the party, one of the rich people and the other of the young men from the general section
 pehle vaale dal ne 1 janvari 1923 ko swaraj party bana lee duusare dal ne krantikari party ke gathan kaa man bana liya
 Some young men from Bengal came directly to Shahjahanpur and met the experienced revolutionary Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil of Mainpuri conspiracy and urged them to cooperate in the formation of a new party
 bismil un dinon silk kii sadiyon ke vyapaar main uljhe hue the unke paas samay nahin tha
 At this Ashfaq explained to him and pledged to cooperate fully on his behalf
 uske baad hi bismil ne apane saajheedaar banarsi laal ko sara karowar saunp diya or puure man se ashfaaq or bismil krantikari party ke kaam main jute gayi
 In view of Ashfaq's commendable role in taking the Revolutionary Review, published in English on 1 January 1925, on behalf of the party to the entire district of Uttar Pradesh, HRA Central member Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee nominated Ashfaq as Bismil's cooperative
 And putting the responsibility of the state on the shoulders of these two, went to Bengal itself
 bengal main shachindranath sanyaal va yogesh chandra chatarji jaise do pramukh vyaktiyon ke giraftaar ho jane par hindustan republican asosiyeshan kaa puraa daaromadar bismil ke kandhon par aa gaya
 In this, apart from Prem Krishna Khanna, Thakur Roshan Singh from Shahjahanpur, Ashfaq Ulla Khan's contribution was commendable
 jab ireland ke krantikariyon kii tarj par jabaran dhan chhinane kii yojana banaayi gayi to ashfaaq ne apane bade bhai riyasat ulla khaan kii licency bandook or do peti kaartoos bismil ko uplabdh karaaye taaki dhanadhy logon ke gharon main dakaitiyaan daalkar party ke liye paisa ikattha kiya ja sake
 But when Bismil planned to loot the government treasury, Ashfaq single-handedly opposed it in the executive meeting
 unka tark tha ki abhi yah kadam uthaanaa khatre se khaali na hoga; sarkaar hamen nestnabud kar degi
 On this, when all the people instead of Ashfaq, Bismil openly said, "panditji! See the act of this mother
 hamaari party main ek muslim ko shaamil karne kii jid kaa asar ab aap hi bhugtiye, ham log to chale
 "ashfaq said this -" Panditji is our leader, we cannot be equal to him
 unka faisla hamen manjur he
 We will not say anything today but tomorrow the whole world will see how a Pathan carried out this action? "and the same happened, the next day as the train moved from Kakori station on the evening of August 9, 1925, Rajendranath Lahiri pulled the chain, Ashfaq
 He placed the driver on the floor of the driver and took him in his possession and Ram Prasad Bismil dropped the treasure box down, slamming the guard on the ground
 lohe kii majboot tijori jab kisi se na tuuti to ashfaaq ne apana moujar manmathanath gupt ko pakadaaya or ghan lekar puri takat se tijori par pil padey
 As soon as Ashfaq's vault was broken, everyone saw his steely strength
 varanaa yadi tijori kuch der or na tuutati or lakhanu se police yaa army aa jaati to mukaable main kai jane ja sakati thim; phir us kakori kand ko itihaas main koi doosraa hi naam diya jaataa
 The night of 26 September 1925, when simultaneous arrests were made in the whole country, Ashfaq escaped by throwing dust in the eyes of the police
 pehle ve nepal gayi kuch din vahanrahakar kanpur aa gayi or ganeshashankar vidhyaarthee ke pratap press main 2 din ruke
 From there, through Banaras, he worked for a few days in Daltonganj, a district of Bihar, but returned to the city of Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, before the police got the idea
 vidhyaarthee ji ne unhen apane paas se kuch rupee dekar bhopal unke bade bhai riyasat ulla khaan ke paas bhej diya
 After staying there for some time, Ashfaq went to Rajasthan and stayed at his brother's friend Arjunlal Sethi's house
 sethi ji kii ladkee un par fida ho gayi or unke saamne shaadi kaa prastaav pesh kar diya
 Finally, one night, he got upset from there and reached Daltonganj in the same district of Bihar and changed his old name and started a job
 ek din bhed khul gaya to ashfaaq train pakad kar dilli chale gayi or apane jile shahjahanpur ke hi mul nivasee ek puraane dost ke ghar par tehre
 Here the same trouble followed Ashfaq
 jiske yahan tehre hue the us dost kii ladkee ne bhi ashfaaq par dore daalane shuru kar diye
 Being convinced of the situation, Ashfaq had made a plan to go abroad and meet Lala Hardayal outside Delhi, that on receiving news of a spy, Ikramul Haq, vice-chairman of Delhi Intelligence Police, arrested him
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki us dost ne hi ashfaaq ko pakadvane main police kii imadad kii thi
 It is a historical fact that the decision of Kakori scandal was heard on 6 April 1926
 ashfaaq ulla khaan or shachindranath bakshi ko police bahut baad main giraftaar kar paayi thi at: special seshan jaj je0aar0dablue0 banet kii adaalat main 7 disambar 1926 ko ek poorak mukadmaa daayar kiya gaya
 The trial magistrate Ainuddin advised Ashfaq to appoint a Muslim lawyer for his case, but Ashfaq insisted and chose Kripashankar Hazela as his lawyer
 is par ek din si0ai0di0 ke police captain khanbahadur tasadduk hossain ne jail main jaakar ashfaaq se mili or unhen phaansi kii sajaa se bachane ke liye sarkari gavaah banane kii salaah di
 When Ashfaq did not listen to his advice, he went in solitude and explained Ashfaq - itnaa sunate hi ashfaaq kii tyoriyaan chadh gayin or ve gusse main daantkar bole- On hearing this, the poor captain lost his seat and he took his face and moved silently from there
 baharhaal 13 july 1927 ko poorak mukademe kaa faisla suna diya gaya - dfa 120 va 121 ke antargat umr-kaid or 396 ke antargat sajaaye-maut arthath phansika dand
 The judge had clearly written in his judgment that these accused did not do this conspiracy for their personal benefit, but even then if these people express their remorse on their actions then the punishment can be reduced
 vakil kii salaah par lakhanu jail main jaakar ashfaaq bismil se mili or unka mat jaananaa chaha
 On this, Bismil explained to them that just as we have to kill one or two pieces in order to win a losing game in chess, in the same way, if we can also file an apology and save ourselves from the death penalty, it would be better
 
 saat saal main umr-kaid puri ho jane ke baad ham isse bhi bhayankar kand karke is beraham sarkaar kii naak main dam kar denge
 On the other hand, with the mutual consent, Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaq Ullah Khan filed their apologies
 ashfaaq ne pehla maafinama 11 agast 1927 va doosraa maafinama 29 agast 1927 ko likhakar bheja
 Additionally, on the advice of the lawyer, another mercy-appeal was sent to the Viceroy and Governor General on behalf of Ashfaq's mother, Musamat Mazhurunnisha Begum, but there was no consideration
 ashfaaq va unki maan ke baad vidhaan sabha sadasyon ne sanyukt rup se hastakshar karke sanyukt praant ke governor wiliam moris ko ek memorendam nainital bheja
 Along with this, Pt Govind Vallabh Pant and CY Chintamani also sent an application, but all efforts remained useless
 22 sitambar 1927 ko home secretary ech0 dablue0 hegg ne apni final report di jiske ant main usne spasht likhaa tha- "in logon kaa uddeshy ek sthapit sarkaar ko ulatna tha
 Since it has been fully proved, it can only be executed in this case, whereas in the Bengal conspiracy, of which it was a branch, no such factual confirmation has been made so far; Therefore, the people there have been kept free from execution
 mujhe pakkaa vishwaas he ki yadi inhen phaansi kii sajaa na dekar jinda chod diya gaya to ye bengal to kya, puure hindustan main fail jaayenge
 " in tamaam apilon va daleelon kaa itnaa asar jarur hua ki phaansi kii taarikh do baar aage badhaa di gayi
 Earlier this date was 16 September 1927, later 11 October 1927
 chunki landan kii privi-concil main marsi-apil ja chuki thi at: phaansi kii taarikh phir se aage ke liye taal di gayi
 Eventually the date of 19 December 1927 was fixed and the information was sent to the four jails
 faijabad jail main yah soochna pahonchte hi ashfaaq ne 29 navambar 1927 ko apane bhai riyasat ulla khaan, 15 disambar 1927 ko apni valida mohatarama majahoorunnishaan begum tathaa 16 disambar 1927 ko apni munh boli bahan nalini didi ko khat likhaa or khuda kii ibaadat main jute gayi
 Jumerat, on the evening of 15 December 1927, from the dungeon of Faizabad jail, Ashfaq Ullah Khan sent his last message in Urdu language by writing the name of the people of Hindustan
 unka makasad yah tha ki muslim samudaay ke log is par khaas tavajjo ata karen
 From page 172 to 178 in a police officer Pt

 ram prasad 'bismil' kii tarah ashfaaq bhi bahut achche shaayar the
 If you compare the poetry of these two, then you will not see even the difference of even a ratty
 pehali baar kii mulaakaat main hi bismil ashfaaq ke mureed ho gayi the jab ek meeting main bismil ke ek sher kaa jabaav unhone apane ustad jigar muradaabadi kii ghazal ke makte se diya tha
 When Bismil said- to ashfaaq ne "amin" kehete hue jabaav diya- There is a daily story of Ashfaq Arya Samaj temple going to Bismil for some work in Shahjahanpur
 sanyog se us samay ashfaaq jigar muradaabadi kii yah ghazal gunaguna rahe the- When Bismil smiled upon hearing this lion, Ashfaq asked, "why Ram brother! Did i say something wrong to Misra?" To this, Bismil replied - "no my Krishna Kanhaiya! This is not the case
" main jigar sahab kii bahut izzat karata hoon magar unhone mirza gaalib kii puraani jameen par ghisa pita sher kahkar koun-sa bada tir maar liya
 If someone had given a new tone, i would have also called Irshad
 " ashfaaq ko bismil kii yah baat janchi nahin; unhone chunauti bhare lahaze main kaha- "to ram bhai! ab aap hi isamen girah lagaaiye, main maan jaaounga aapaki soch jigar or mirza gaalib se bhi parale darje kii he
 "at the same time, Pandit Ram Prasad 'bismil' said this lion - yah sunate hi ashfaaq uchhal padey or bismil ko gale laga ke bole- "ram bhai! maan gayi; aap to ustaadon ke bhi ustad hai
 " iske baad to ashfaaq or bismil main hode-si lag gayi ek se ek umdaa sher kehane kii
 But if we look carefully, then there was a kind of telepathy work in both of them, only then they show uniformity in their feelings
 misaal ke taur par chand misare hajir hai:bismil kaa yah sher- How close does this piece of Ashfaq seem? mulk kii mali haalat ko khasta hota dekhakar likhi gayi bismil kii ye panktiyaan- How many more meet this lion of Ashfaq? isi prakaar vatan kii barwaadi par bismil kii peeda- This lion of Ashfaq resembling it is not inferior in his capacity bismil kii ek bady mashhoor ghazal ummide-sukhan kii ye panktiyaan- Ashfaq liked it very much
 unhone isi bahar main sirf ek hi sher kaha tha jo unki aprakashit diary main is prakaar miltaa he:- Those who want to do a special or comparative study of the poetry of Ashfaq and Bismil can go to any library and see the second part of the history book of the revolutionary literature of the freedom struggle

 On 22 January 1988, he faced Larry Holmes and defeated the former heavyweight champion by a fourth-round KO
 In 75 professional matches, Holmes had to go through a knockout defeat in this match
 In March, Tyson had a fight with contender Tony Tubbs in Tokyo, Japan, winning an easy win between promotion and marketing
 27 june 1988 ko, tyson ne maaikel spinks kaa saamana kiya
 Spinks, who took the heavyweight championship from Larry Holmes by a 15-round decision in 1985, did not lose his title in the ring, but was not recognized as a champion by major boxing organizations

 Without Rooney, Tyson's skills soon began to erode and he began to seek more of a box knockout, rather than using the combination that made him a star
 He also started hitting his head and ignored the first attack on the opponent's body
 In addition, he started losing his defense skills and jabbed and neglected to make his way inwards, he started moving directly towards the opponent
 In 1989 Tyson made only two bouts amidst personal turmoil
 He faced popular British boxer Frank Bruno in a fight in February, in which Bruno stunned Tyson at the end of the first round, although Tyson went on to knockout Bruno in the fifth round
 Tyson then knocked out Carl "the Truth" Williams in a round in July
 1989 main, tyson ko ohio main central state uniwarsity se human letters main doctoret kii ek maanad oopaadhi di gai

 jhula iskaa ek vyaavhaarik udhaaharan he
 The pendulum oscillates and returns again after any point, it is called its 'periodic'
 yadi lolak kaa aayam kam ho to iskaa aavartkaal aayam par nirbhar nahin karata balki keval lolak kii lambaai or gurutvajanit twaran ke sthaneey maan par nirbhar hota he
 The periodicity of the pendulum also does not depend on the mass of the pendulum
 jahaan l lolak kii lambaai he, tathaa g us sthaan par gurutvajanit twaran kaa maan he
 It is clear from this formula that if the amplitude is low, the periodicity will be the same for different dimensions
 lolak ke is gun ko 'samakalikta' kehete hai
 Due to its quality, pendulum is used in timeliness
 kintu yadi aayam bada he to aavartkaal niyat nahin rahata balki aayam badhane par kramshah badhata he
 For example, if the amplitude is θ0 = 23 °, then the periodic value will be about 1% more than the value obtained from the equation
