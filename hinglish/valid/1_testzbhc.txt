 yah vidhi radial veg vidhi, dopler vidhi or dagamag vidhi ke teen naamon se jaati jaati he
 When a planet revolves around its ancestral body, it also exerts a gravitational effect on its ancestral body, from which that star also revolves around the codification center of that planetary group
 koi bhi tara hamaare saura mandal ke saapeksh kisi veg se hill rahaa hota he, or yah veg us taare ke varnakram main dopler prabhaav dwaara hue khiskaav se mapa ja saktaa he
 In this velocity, a radial velocity is also added to the orbit of that star and we can see it by twisting in the velocity of that star
 agar us taare ke saura mandal main ek se adhik grah maujuud ho to uske kul veg main un sabhi grahon ke prabhaav se mishrit radial veg dikhataa he jise ham ganit ke prayog se alag kar sakate hai
 Our instruments need to be very sensitive to measure these effects, for example the giant Jupiter in our Sun produces a radial velocity of only 13 m / s and the radial velocity generated by the Earth is only 1 m / s
 phir bhi samay ke saath-saath hamaare yantra viksit hote chale gaye or ab bahut se bahirgrah is vidhi se paae jate hai
 After the Sun, the planet Proxima Centauri, orbiting the nearest star Proxima Centauri, was discovered in 2016 by the same radial velocity method
 yah prakritik baat he ki kisi pitrugrah kaa dravyaman jitna kam hoga, uski parikrama kar rahaa bahirgrah jitna bada hoga or us grah kii parikrama kaksha kii trigya jitani choti hogi, us grah kaa apane pitrutare par prabhaav utana hi adhik hoga or us taare main radial veg kaa prabhaav bhi utana hi aasaani se dekha ja sakegaa
 For this reason, a large number of outliers found by the radial velocity method are either very small in size, or they are supermassive, or the distance of star-planet is very short

 The problem of Chiang Mai also increases because the city, like the city of Los Angeles and Salt Lake, is a natural geographic bowl surrounded by hills
 parinamtah hawa kii awajahi dhimi pad jaati he or vah kaaron or jalte hue kachare se jo dhul kan nikalate hai unhen bhi uthaa leti he

 But in a daydream, a person with a certain type of experience knows that he is experiencing something of the sort

 During an experiment, some scientists also believed that this is possible but when they identify themselves in the dream then it would be very difficult to come out of that dream and this increases the chances of a person with weak mind to go into a coma
 Being with a person is nothing short of a miracle
 swapn kii ghatnaayen vartmaan kaal se sambandh rakhti hai
 The events of daydreams are related to past and future
 bhartiya drushtikon ke anusaar swapn chetana kii chaar avasthaaon main se ek vishesh avasthaa he
 The remaining three states are the waking state, the sleep state, and the turya state
 swapn or jaagratavastha main anek prakaar kii samantaayein hai
 Therefore, dream experiences are explained on the basis of waking state
 isi prakaar swapn anubhavon ke aadhaar par jaagratavastha ke anubhavon ko bhi samajhaayaa jaataa he
 a dream is a form of human memories, feelings, fantasies, thoughts, thoughts, desires and the greatest of all is his fear
 swapnon kaa adhyayan manovigyaan ke liye ek nayaa vishay he
 Ordinarily, the experience of the dream is such an experience which according to our general logic seems utterly meaningless
 atev saadhaarant: manavaigyanik swapn ke vishay main charchaa karanevaalon ko nikamma vyakti maanate hai
 In ancient times, ordinary illiterate people used to discuss dreams because they thought that they could predict future events through dreams
 yah vishwaas saamaanya janata main aaj bhi he
 Modern scientific thinking considers this type of belief to be baseless and considers it to be superstition
 swapnon ke vaigyanik adhyayan dwaara yah jaanane kii cheshtaa kii gai he ki bahari uttejnaaon ke prabhaav se kis prakaar ke swapn ho sakate hai
 By putting cold water on a sleeping person's feet, he often dreams of walking in the river

 Different types of effects on the body produce different types of dreams
 swapnon kaa adhyayan chikitsa drushti se bhi kiya gaya he
 Usually, in the heightened stage of the disease, the patient sees terrible dreams and when he starts getting better, he sees benign scenes in dreams
 swapnon ke adhyayan ke liye manovaigyanik kabhi-kabhi sammohan kaa prayog karte hai
 When the patient is put to sleep by giving special type of hypnosis, then he sees dreams according to those hypnosis
 kuch manovaigyanik sote samay rogi ko swapnon ko yaad rakhane kaa nirdesh de dete hai
 Then the patient does not forget his dreams
 maansik rogi ko prarambh main swapn yaad hi nahin rahete
 By dreaming such a patient, his dreams can be recalled
 saadhaarant: ham swapnon main unheen baton ko dekhte hai jinke sanskaar hamaare mastishk par ban jate hai
 We often see that our dreams have no relation with the waking state
 kabhi kabhi ham swapn ke un bhaagon ko bhul jate hai jo hamaare jivan ke liye vishesh arth rakhte hai
 Skilled psychologists achieve such dreams through hypnosis
 dekha gaya he ki jin swapnon ko manushya bhul jaataa he ve uske jivan kii aisi baton ko chetana ke samaksh laate hai jo use atyant apriy hoti hai or jinka bhul janaa hi uske liye shreyaskar hota he
 Such things can be reminded to a person by special type of hypnosis
 in swapnon kaa maansik chikitsa main vishesh mahatv rahata he
 According to Indian astrology, the dream is determined according to the time and place in which the dream is seen
 swapn ke vishay main sabase mahatv kii khojein doctor sigmund frid ne kii hai
 He determined from his study that to know the inner mind of man it is absolutely necessary to know his dreams
 "interpritesan ov drims ov drims" naamak apane granth main inhone yah bataane kii cheshtaa kii he ki jin swapnon ko ham nirarthak samajhate hai unke vishesh arth hote hai
 They have tried to explain the meaning of the signs of dreams and to clarify their composition
 inke kathananusaar swapn hamaari un ichchhaaon ko saamaanya rup se athwa pratik rup se vyakt karata he jisaki tripti jaagrath avasthaa main nahin hoti
 When the child does not express his desire to buy sweets and toys for fear of the scolding of the father, his repressed desire attains fulfillment through dreams
 jaise jaise manushya kii umr badhati jaat he uskaa samaaj kaa bhay jatil hota jaataa he
 Because of this fear, he not only tries to hide his unreasonable desires from others but he also hides from himself
 doctor frid ke anusaar manushya ke man ke teen bhaag hai
 The first part is the one in which all desires come and find their fulfillment
 inaki tripti ke liye manushya ko apni ichhashakti se kaam lenaa padataa he
 This part of the mind is called the conscious mind
 yah bhaag bahari jagat se vyakti kaa samanvay sthapit karata he
 The second part of the human mind is called the unconscious mind
 yah bhaag uski sabhi prakaar kii bhogechhaon kaa aashray he
 In this, all his repressed desires remain
 uske man kaa teesraa bhaag avchetan man kehalaata he
 In this part, man's moral self remains
 doctor frid ne naitik swatv ko rajya ke censor vibhaag kii upama di he
 Just as the state's censor department investigates any new news before it is published
 usee prakaar manushya ke avchetan man main upasthit censor arthath naitik swatv kisi bhi vaasana ke swapnchetana main prakashit hone ke purv kaant chhant kar detaa he
 After having a very unpleasant or immoral dream, a person has self-immolation
 swapndrashtaa ko is aatmabhatrsana se bachaane ke liye uske man kaa censor vibhaag swapnon main anek prakaar kii todmarod karke dabi ichha ko prakashit karata he
 Then upon awakening, this sensor makes us forget that part of the dream
 jisase aatmabhatrsana ho
 That is why we forget all the dreams
 dow frid ne swapnon ke pratikon ke vishesh prakaar ke arth bataaen hai
 Most of these symbols are genitals related
 unke kathananusaar swapn main honevaali bahut si nirarthak kriyaayein ratikriya kii bodhak hoti hai
 His statement is that man's main desire is sex
 isi se use adhik se adhik shaareerik sukh miltaa he or isi kaa uske jivan main sarvaadhik rup se daman bhi hota he
 Most of our repressed desires are secretly illuminated by various symbols in the dream
 sabase adhik dayit honevaali ichha kamechha he
 Therefore our greater dreams belong to the same
 maansik rogiyon ke vishay main dekha gaya he ki ek ore uski prabal kamechha damit avasthaa main rahati he or duusari ore uski upasthiti sweekaar karnaa unke liye kathin hota he
 That is why the dreams of mental patients are not only complicated but they also forget
 doctor frid ne swapnrachana ke paanch-saat prakaar bataae hai
 Principal among them are summarization, expansion, transposition and dramatization
 sankshepan ke anusaar koi bahut bada prasang chota kar diya jaataa he
 This is exactly the opposite in expansion
 isamen swapnchetana ek thode se anubhav ko lambey swapn main vyakt karti he
 Suppose someone insulted us in a party and we want to avenge it
 parantu hamaara naitik swapn iskaa virdohi he, to ham apane swapn main dekhenge ki jis vyakti ne hamaara apmaan kiya he vah anek prakaar durghatnaon main padaa hua he
 We want to help him, but circumstances are such that we are unable to help him
 bhavantareekaran kii avasthaa main ham apane aniatik bhav ko aise vyakti ke prati prakashit hote nahin dekhte jiske prati un bhaavon kaa prakaashan hona aatmaglani paidaa karata he
 Sometimes teenage boys have terrible dreams
 unamem ve kisi rakshas se ladate hue apane ko pate hai
 Psychoanalysis suggests that this demon remains his father, uncle, elder brother, teacher or a disciplinarian
 naatakeekaran ke anusaar jab koi vichaar ichha athwa swapn main prakashit hota he to vah adhiktar drushti pratimaaon kaa sahaara letaa he
 Dreaming shows many poignant things by portraying an entire situation
 swapn kisi shiksha ko sidhe rup se nahin detaa
 It is not possible to immediately convey the meaning that is expressed through many pictures and events in a dream
 maan lijie, ham akele main hai or hamen dar lagata he ki hamaare upar koi akraman na kar kar de
 This small gesture produces many dreams
 ham aisi paristhiti main pad jate hai jahaan ham apane ko surakshit samajhate hai parantu hamen baad ko baari dhokhaa hota he
 Dr
 Freud states that dreams have two forms - one published and the other unpublished
 jo swapn hamen yaad aata he vah prakashit rup he
 This form comes to our consciousness with many of the above-mentioned break-up compositions and symbols
 swapn kaa vaastavik rup yah he jise gudh manovaigyanik khoj ke dwaara praapt kiya jaataa he
 The meaning that dreams impose by ordinary people is far from its true meaning
 yah vaastavik arth swapnnirmaan kala ke jane bina nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 Dr
 Freud has mentioned the following about importance of dreaming: The dream is the result of mental regression
 yah pratigaman thode kaal ke liye rahata he
 Therefore, it does not harm the mental development of a person
 duusare yah pratigaman abhinay ke rup main hota he
 For this reason, it causes catharsis of human desires which are of childhood stage
 yadi aise swapn manushya ko na hon to uskaa maansik vikaas ruk jaae athwa use kisi na kisi prakaar kaa maansik rog ho jaae
 Dr
 Freud has said the second important thing that the dream is not destroyer of sleep but its protector
 bhayanak athwa uttejk swapnon se damit uttejnaa baahar aakar shant ho jaati he
 a dream is a way to solve complex problems of human hearing
 frid ne teesri baat yah bataai ki swapn na to vyarth maansik anubhav he or na usamen dekhe gaye drishy nirarthak hote hai
 a person's mental health is protected by unpleasant dreams
 swapnon kaa adhyayan karnaa man ke aantarik rup ko samajhane ke liye nitant aavashyak he
 Dr
 Freud has called dreams the key to the inner mind of man
 swapn sambandhi baatcheet se rogi ke bahut se damit bhav chetana kii sataha par aate hai or is tarah unka rechan ho jaataa he
 Listening to many dreams of a patient and applying their meaning, the disease of the patient is destroyed
 maansik chikitsa kii praarambhik avasthaa main rogi ko praaia: swapn yaad hi nahin rahete
 As the emotional unity of the patient and the physician is established, the dreams start getting more and more and more clear
 ek hi swapn kai prakaar se hota he
 The sense of dream comes to the doctor through many types of dreams
 charles yung ne swapn ke vishay main kuch baaten doctor frid se bhinn kahi hai
 According to his statement, dream symbols do not have the same meaning at all times
 swapnon ke vaastavik arth jaanane ke liye swapndrashtaa ke vyaktitv ko jaananaa, uski vishesh samasyaon ko samajhnaa or us samay desh, kaal or paristhitiyon ko dhyaan main rakhana nitant aavashyak he
 The same dream has different meanings for different dreamers and it has different meanings for different circumstances even for the same dreamer
 atev jab tak swayan swapndrashtaa kisi arth ko sweekaar na kar le tab tak hamen yah nahin jaananaa chahie ki swapn kaa vaastavik arth praapt hoga
 According to the belief of Dr
 Freud, more dreams are related to our lust
 yung ke kathananusaar swapnon kaa kaaran manushya ke keval vaiyaktik anubhav athwa uski swaarthmayi ichchhaaon kaa hi daman maatr nahin hota varan uske gambhirtam man kii aadhyatmik anubhutiyaan bhi hoti hai
 Due to this, a person gets lifelong education through his dreams
 charles yung ke matanusaar swapn keval puraane anubhavon kii pratikriya maatr nahin hai varan ve manushya ke bhavi jivan se sambandh rakhte hai
 Dr
 Freud tries to understand all the reactions of the human mind according to the normal natural inertial causal system
 inke pratikul doctor yung maansik pratikriyaaon ko mukhyat: lakshyapurna siddh karte hai
 The scientific system which is suitable for understanding the behavior of root substances, the same system cannot be used to explain conscious actions
 chetana ke sabhi kaary lakshyapurna hote hai
 a dream is also a similar goal, which aims to make the patient's future life sick or successful
 yung ke kathananusaar manushya swapn dwaara aisi baaten jaan saktaa he jinke anusaar chalane se vah apane aapako anek prakaar kii durghatnaon or du:khon se bachaa saktaa he
 He has explained this fact through several examples
 swapn kaa vigyaan -ham raat bhar swapn dekhte hai
 Diva dreams are also often seen by people, Diva dreams are called Kalpana
 need main dekha gaya swapn hi swapn hota he
 Sometimes some short-term dreams are remembered
 shruti main swapn ke vishay main jagah jagah charchaa huyi he
 In the Vrhadaranyaka Upanishad there is a theme about the dream, just as a king travels the country with his servants and subjects, similarly the creature wanders into his body at will, taking life, words, speech, etc
 in his life
 vrihadaaranyak upanishad main varnan he swapnavastha main jeev lok–paralok donon dekhtaa he or dukh sukh donon kaa anubhav karata he
 By stunning this gross body, the creature creates a sensuous body and then the world sees the other world
 is avasthaa main desh-videsh, nadi, talab, sagar, parvat maidan
 vriksh, mel, mutr, stri, purush, sex, krodh, bhay aadi naanaa prakaar ke sansar kii rachana kar letaa he
 Even in the dream by the creature, the creation of earthly things is created
 yah rachana atyant rahasyamay or ati vicitra hoti he
 In the Mandukyopanishad, the dream is explained in a deep way
 swapn bhaanti sam vyaapt jag gyaan brahm par brahm saat ang unniis mukh taijas doosar paad
 Special - Seven parts are seven worlds
 muladhar, swaadhishthan, manipur, anahath, vishuddh, ajna, sahatradhar chakra
 unniis mukh paanch karmendriyaan, paanch gyanendriyaan
paanch praan- praan, apan, samaan,’vyaan, udaan tathaa man, buddhi, chitt, ahankaar
 The second and best type of shape is the common sense dream
 swapn main jeevatma apni sabhi oopaadhiyon ke samooh saath ek hota he, is samay antajkaran tejomay hone ke kaaran is avasthaa main aatma ko taijas kaha he
 Taizas is the third stage from the top to the bottom of the Brahman
 swapnavastha main donon jeevatma or aatma kaa taijas swaroop manovriti se shabd sparsh rup ras gandh kaa anubhav karte hai
 Taizus is the consumer of subtle subjects
 jeevatma or aatma kaa taijas swaroop donon abhed hai jaise jal kii boond main or jalashay main padane vaala akaash kaa prativimb
kathopanishad kahata he- ‘ya esh supteshu jagarti kaaman kaaman purusho nirmimanh’ yah purush jo naanaa bhogon kii rachana karata he sabake so jane par swayan jaagta he
 Here the man is told to be the creator of wishes
 atah siddh he swapn main bhi sristi hoti he,kya swapn main hui sristi vaastavik he
 -no instantaneously, the existence of the creation in the dream does not show any existence, but i have a definite view in this matter that whatever is seen in the dream is sure to be in some form or other in the form of some creature or substance
 
 swapn or sristi ke vikaas kaa gaharaa sambandh he swapn he to sristi he or sristi he to swapn hai
 Auspicious and Inauspicious Results of Shruti - Shruti is of the opinion that dreams are indicative of auspicious and inauspicious results in future
 etrey aaranyak ke anusaar swapn main daant vaale purush ko dekhnaa mrityu kaa suchak he
 It is said in the Chandyopanishad that when a woman is seen in a dream to fulfill her wish, it is a sign of prosperity
 aadi Mystery of Supti - Suspicion Black Sakale Villain Tamobhobhit: Sukhroopmeeti - Kevalya prayek praani ke liye need aavashyak he need kii do avasthaaen he
 Dreaming and Sleep
 Sleep is the state when there is no dream
 The Question Question Council states that when the CNS is fully empowered by Udaan Vayu, then there is a state of sleep
 veydant bataata he sushupti kaal main indriyon or unke vishay nahin rahete
 is avasthaa main koi aasakti na hone se yahan jeev anand kaa anubhav karata he
 In the sleep period, both gross and microscopic merge
 vyaavhaariksatta or swapn prapanch apane kaaran agyaan main leen ho jate hai
 Only the pure conscious portion is present
 is avasthaa main ishwar or jeev anand kaa anabhav karte hai parantu is samay vritti agyaanamay hoti he manducopanishad sushupti ko spasht karata he
 No, not a dream, but a visible dream, the body of knowledge, the consciousness of the divine, the divine, the enjoyer, the Brahman on the third foot
 makaar teesri maatra maap jaan villin susupti sthaan sam deh hepragna tisar paad jaan maap sarvasv ko sab lay hot swabhaav
 Freed from enlightenment and ignorant instinct, one experiences joy
 isi kaaran sokar uthaa hua manushya kahata he main sukh purvak soya, bade chaiyn se soya, in shabdon se sushupti main anand ke astitv kaa pataa chalata he
 i do not remember anything, it also shows the existence of ignorance

 The expansion and strengthening of Western culture, beginning with the Greeks, was carried out by the Romans, reformed and modernized through the Renaissance and Reformation of the fifteenth century and progressively spread European ways of life and education from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries
 It was globalized by European empires
 darshan, madhyayugin matvaad evam rahasyavaad, isai evam dharmanirpeksh maanavtawaad kii ek jatil shrinkhalaa ke saath europea samskruti kaa vikaas hua

 In particular, Western culture can mean: pashchimi saanskriti kii avadharana aam taur par pashchimi duniya kii shastreey paribhaasha se judi hui he
 In this definition, Western culture is a set of literary, scientific, political, artistic and philosophical theories that distinguish it from other civilizations
