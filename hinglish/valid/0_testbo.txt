 Mango is the king of fruits
 barsaat main to har ghar main aap aam dekh sakate hai
 Mango has also been called the king of fruits because most people like it and it is also rich in nutrients
 aam jahaan pachan tantra ko thik rakhata he, vahiin twachaa kii komalta ke liye bhi yah kargar he
 It is also helpful in clearing the skin color
 lekin itane phaaydon vaala yah aam nuksaandeh bhi hota he
 Have started forgetting to eat small things daily, so it is important to know some things before eating mangoes
 ham yahaan aapako kuch aisi hi baaten bataa rahe hai
 
 
 1
 diabetic hai to aam se rahen dur :ye baat thik he ki aam main nejural sugar hota he
 But our body also needs natural sugar in a limit
 isliye yadi aap diabetic hai to behatar hoga ki aap aam se thodi duuri banaaen
 The hobby of mango can also make you go round the hospital
 nahin banataa mood, haaavee rahata he STRESS to roj khaaen chocolate2
 The more common food boils
 The taste of mango is such that you cannot stop yourself even after wanting it and go on eating mango continuously
 aise main yah jaan len ki aam bahut hi garm fal hota he or iske zyada seven se chehre par phode-funsi or dane ho sakate hai
 So eat in mango limit or else mango will steal both the tone and brightness of the face
 3
 Ringworm, Scabies and Itching: Remember that mango has a scream or fluid on its mouth that if you do not clean it properly or do not exclude it, it will spoil the taste of the mouth, but if it is applied on the mouth, then it can cause ringworm, itching and rash Can also bring iske alaava gale yadi ye gale main chalaa jaataa he kharash to paidaa karegaa hi balki dard or sujan donon paidaa kar saktaa he
 Those who are suffering from diseases like arthritis and sinus, they must make a short distance from the mango
 bade cardie arest ke maamle, healdi heart ke liye khaaen ye 5 masaale4
 Stomach upset: Keep in mind some mangoes may increase more
 aam kaa sidhaa sambandh aapke pet se hota he
 Remember that sweet, tasty and tasteful mango is as good as it takes to eat, the more it can also worsen the stomach condition
 zyada aam khaane se looj moshan, pet main aanv padana jaisi beemaari ho sakati he
 Overall mangoes can worsen the digestion
 5
 Increases weight: As soon as the mango season comes, people break up to eat it
 yah sehat ke liye kitna jaruri he iskaa bilkul bhi dhyaan rakhte hai
 Eating more mango leads to more calories in the body, which increases our weight
 aapako bataa den ek madhyayam aakaar ke aam main 135 calories pai jaati he
 Do not increase weight, so pay attention when eating more mangoes

 Pathan got a place in the last-minute squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and he has solved the problem of India's all-rounder to some extent at the moment by performing brilliantly with both bat and ball
 pathan ne srilanka ke khilaaf paanch ekadivasiy maichon main visham palon main acchhee ballebaaji kii
 Apart from this, he has also justified his selection by bowling tight
 baroda ke is olerounder ne chaar pariyon main teen baar naabad rahete hue 76 ran banaae, jabaki aath wicket bhi liye
 These include a five-wicket haul for 61 in the last match at Pallekal on Saturday, helping India win the match and the series 4–1
 dilachasp baat yah he ki pathan ko is shrunkhlaa ke liye pehle team main nahin chunaa gaya tha
 a few days before the tour of the Indian team, Vinay Kumar got injured and the selectors chose Pathan in his place
 yah is olerounder ke paas aakhri mauka tha, kyonki lagbhag teen saal tak baahar rahane ke baad jab unhone vaapasi kii, to vah chayankartaaon ko prabhavit nahin kar paae the
 Pathan's performance in Sri Lanka is important now because India's forward schedule is very busy and he will need an all-rounder at all times

 In the meantime, he also impressed with his batting and in some Test matches, he was also introduced to the innings
 jab greg chapel coach the, to unhone pathan ko ballebaaji par adhik dhyaan dene ke liye kaha
 The comments pathan hameshaa doharaate rahe ki vah pehle gendbaaj hai or tab ballebaaj, lekin 2006 ke baad unki gendbaaji beasar hone lagi, jiske kaaran unhen antim ekadash main jagah banane ke liye sangharsh karnaa padaa
 Pathan made a comeback in December last year, but did not perform consistently after that
 unhone disambar se srilanka daure se pehle tak aath match main 100 ran banaae tathaa 13 wicket liye, lekin bangladesh main khele gaye asia cap main vah buree tarah flop rahe, jiske baad unhen team se baahar kar diya gaya tha
 Now he is back in rhythm and if he maintains this performance, India will not have to face the problem of all-rounder and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will have more options

 pathan kaa aakhri match main pradarshan kaaphi myne rakhata he, kyonki pichley paanch saal main yah chauthaa avasar he, jabaki kisi bhartiya gendbaaj ne van-de match main paanch wicket liye
 Pathan is also satisfied with his performance
 unhone kaha, khuda kaa shukr he ki is puri shrunkhlaa main maine acchhee gendbaaji kii or kuch upyogi ran bhi banaae
 Pathan was selected for the first time in 2004 as a fast bowler in the team
 iske baad unhone bhartiya gendbaaji kaa jimmaa acchhee tarah sambhala
 In the meantime, he also impressed with his batting and in some Test matches, he was also introduced to the innings
 jab greg chapel coach the, to unhone pathan ko ballebaaji par adhik dhyaan dene ke liye kaha
 The comments pathan hameshaa doharaate rahe ki vah pehle gendbaaj hai or tab ballebaaj, lekin 2006 ke baad unki gendbaaji beasar hone lagi, jiske kaaran unhen antim ekadash main jagah banane ke liye sangharsh karnaa padaa
 Pathan made a comeback in December last year, but did not perform consistently after that
 unhone disambar se srilanka daure se pehle tak aath match main 100 ran banaae tathaa 13 wicket liye, lekin bangladesh main khele gaye asia cap main vah buree tarah flop rahe, jiske baad unhen team se baahar kar diya gaya tha
 Now he is back in rhythm and if he maintains this performance, India will not have to face the problem of all-rounder and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni will have more options
 dilachasp baat yah he ki pathan ko is shrunkhlaa ke liye pehle team main nahin chunaa gaya tha
 a few days before the tour of the Indian team, Vinay Kumar got injured and the selectors chose Pathan in his place
 yah is olerounder ke paas aakhri mauka tha, kyonki lagbhag teen saal tak baahar rahane ke baad jab unhone vaapasi kii, to vah chayankartaaon ko prabhavit nahin kar paae the

 pathan kaa ab srilanka main pradarshan isliye mahatvapurn he, kyonki bharat kaa aage kaa kaarykram kaaphi vyast he or use har samay ek olerounder kii jarurat padegi
 Pathan's performance in the last match is important, as this is the fourth occasion in the last five years, while an Indian bowler took five wickets in a one-day match
 pathan bhi apane pradarshan se santusht hai
 He said, "thank God that in this entire series i bowled well and also made some useful runs
" pathan ko 2004 main pehali baar tej gendbaaj ke taur par team main chunaa gaya tha
 After that, he handled Indian bowling well
 is bich unhone apni ballebaaji se bhi prabhavit kiya tathaa kuch test maichon main to unase pari kaa aagaaj bhi karavaaya gaya
 When Greg Chappell was the coach, he told Pathan to focus more on batting
 tippaniyan Pathan always kept reiterating that he was the first bowler and then batsman, but after 2006 his bowling started to become ineffective, forcing him to struggle for a place in the playing XI
 pathan ne pichley saal disambar main vaapasi kii, lekin iske baad nirantar ek jaisaa pradarshan nahin kar paae
 He scored 100 runs in eight matches and took 13 wickets before the Sri Lanka tour from December, but he flopped badly in the Asia Cup played in Bangladesh, after which he was dropped from the team
 ab vah phir se lay main aa gaye hai or yadi vah is pradarshan ko barkaraar rakhte hai, to bharat ko olerounder kii samasya se nahin jujhna padegaa or captain mahendra singh dhoni ke paas adhik vikalp rahenge

 apni maang puri nahin hone kii sthiti main wo apane mantriyon or vidhayakon ke saath centre sarkaar ke grih mantralay ke daftar ke baahar dharna denge
 Even though it may be named the dharna politics of the newly fledged Chief Minister Kejriwal, but before that, he has definitely started playing Twitter politics by making social media a weapon
 arvind kejariwal ne twitor ke jariye bhi dilli police or grih mantralay par jamkar hamalaa bolaa he
 Kejriwal has even appealed to the people about his protest
 ganatantr diwas kii taiyaariyon ke maddenjar main apane samarthakon or logon se apil karata hum ki wo dharne main na aaen

 twitor ke jariye unhone sidhe-sidhe janata se bhi unki raay maangi he
 He wrote, 'A woman was burnt alive in Delhi
 ek aaropee ko chhod baaki sabhi aaazaad hai
 The local SHO has denied his arrest
 kya us esechao ko dand nahin diya janaa chahie
 If a Danish woman is gangraped in Delhi, should not the policemen be held guilty for negligence in duty
 ’kejariwal ke twitor waar ko dekhakar sunakar aasaani se samajha ja saktaa he ki aam aadmi party kis kadar grih mantralay or uske adheen aane vaali dilli police ke kaamkaaj ke tareeke se bhannai hui he

 On the other hand, the government repeatedly speaks of commitment to the Lokpal in front of the public, but in the end it seems to be running some political trick
 is baar bhi sthiti kamobesh waisi hi maaloom padati he
 The Lokpal Bill is likely to be tabled in the Rajya Sabha on Monday or Tuesday in an amended manner, including removing the controversial provision of the Lokayukta and bringing more transparency in the appointment of the CBI chief
 is baat kii kaaphi atakalein lagaayi ja rahi thim is par cabinet kii ore se guuruuvaar ko charchaa kii ja sakati he, lekin aisa nahin hua
 Sources said that after passage in the Rajya Sabha, it can be given actual approval later

 Some sources say that the bill may come in the Rajya Sabha on Monday while some others are insisting that it can be done till Tuesday which will be the last day of the budget session
 carmik rajya mantri ve narayansami ne se kaha, ‘sarkaar vidheyak ko vartmaan satr main laane ko patibaddh he
 'the government and the opposition agree that the Lokayukta provision be removed from the bill and a separate model law can be passed in which the states will act as a guideline to enact their own anti-corruption law
 jaankaree ke anusaar lokapal ko hataane ke mudde par sarkaar vipaksh kii maang ke kareeb he ki sarkaar ke paas hi sabhi adhikaar nahin hone chahie
 Efforts are on to draw a middle way in which Parliament will decide on the matter and then inform it to the Supreme Court

 Even after a few rounds of talks between the government and the opposition on the controversial Lokpal Bill, issues such as giving more autonomy to the CBI and the appointment and removal of the Lokpal remain a subject of deadlock
 sarkaar ne lokapal vidheyak par aam
 In an effort to reach a consensus, the leaders of the opposition have approached and talked to them on some issues

 Law Minister Salman Khurshid, Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal had a chat with Rajya Sabha Leader of Opposition Arun Jaitley and CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechury on the issue
 sutron ne kaha ki sarkaar sibiai ko swytt banane ke paksh main nahin he lekin vah vipaksh ke is rukh se sahamat bataai jaati he ki agency ke nideshak kii niyukti ek collegium dwaara kii jaani chahie

 (from input language) syria se ai karishme kii nai tasviir
 Two year old girl came out of the wreck
 bam dhamaake main jameendoj hua tha makaan
 a bomb from the sky made the house a grave
 kabr main tabdeel ghar ke andar ek bacchee ghanton ghutati rahi
 Then some people heard the cry of this child in their ears
 iske baad jo karishma hua wo hairaan kar dene vaala tha
 This incident is from the area of baghdadi, Syria
 malbe se nikali 2 saal kii baccheeasman se utari insaani afat main ghar kabr main tabdeel ho chukaa tha
 But only then comes the cry of a child crying from a part of the house that has been built
 aawaaj ke hisse kii khudaai kii jaati he
 That too with hands
 taaki us bachche ko chot naa lag ja
 And then nature shows her charisma as a 2-year-old girl coming out of the rubble
 kai ton malbe ke neeche aundhe munh fansi thi maasoom
 To teach a lesson to ISIS and anti-factions, no one knows where, who and who bombed the head of the city, flying over the city day and night, and the biggest difficulty is that the bombs do not even know the difference between the innocent and the guilty
 malbe main se ai rone kii aawajaise membembarise jameendoj ek makaan ke malbe se logon ko achaanak kisi bacchee ke rone kii aawaaj sunai detii he
 Hearing such a voice from under the rubble of hundreds of tons of brick, concrete and headings is nothing short of a miracle in itself
 lihaaza, log bagaiyr der kiye us maasoom aawaaj kaa peechha karnaa shuru kar dete hai
 These sounds are sometimes loud and sometimes stop altogether
 lekin yahaan sawaal ek jindagi kaa he, lihaaja log der nahin karte or thik usee jagah haathon se khudaai shuru kar dete hai, jahaan se ye rone kii aawaaj aa rahi he
 Digging out the hands and taking out the girl, the truth is that from the top it was also very difficult to guess exactly where that girl could be in the pile of debris
 lekin phir koshish jari rahati he
 And at the same time several pairs of hands begin to remove heavy pieces of concrete along with sand and clay
 or thik ek minute or chalis second ke baad ek doosraa karishma hota he
 For the first time, the baby's hand appears from under the rubble
 bacchee aundhe munh padi he or dhul-mitti ke bich is kadar fansi he ki uske liye hilanaa-dulana to dur saans bhi lenaa mushkil he
 But it is probably the will of the above that despite being caught in such a difficult situation, the cry of his cry was heard to the people outside the rubble
 dhul se bhari hui bacchee nikali bahkeb khudaai or tej ho jaati he or phir dekhte hi dekhte haath ke saath-saath bacchee kaa sir or jism ke duusare hisse bhi najar aane lagate hai
 People try to somehow pull the girl upright so that she can breathe freely, because the dust, the eyes, nose, mouth, ears of the girl trapped in the debris, has filled the dust everywhere
 log jald hi bacchee ko sidhaa bithaane main kaamyaab ho jate hai
 But as soon as his hands are free, he starts rubbing his eyes with both hands
 jaahir he, use sabase zyada takalif ankhon main bhare ret kii vajah se he
