 According to Vishnu Purana, there are innumerable small and large pilgrimages in the periphery of Kamavan

 were built by King Kamsen, which is an invaluable heritage here
 yahan kameshwar mahadev, shri gopinath ji, shrigokul chandramaa ji, shri radhavallabh ji, shri madan mohan ji, shrivrinda devi aadi amanxira hai
 Although many temples here are being destroyed due to lack of maintenance, yet some of the pilgrimages here still show their pride and the leelas of Shri Krishna

 Business is also called 'company', 'enterprise' or 'firm'
 poonjeewaadi arthvyavasthaaon main vyapaar kaa pramukh sthaan he jo adhikanshat: nijee haathon main hote hai or laabh kamaane ke dhyey se kaam karte hai tathaa saath-saath swayan vyapaar kii bhi vruddhi karte hai
 However, cooperatives and government-run institutions are often created to serve other purposes rather than profits
 ham vyavsaayik vaataavaran main rahete hai
 It is an essential part of society
 yah vyavsaayik kriyaaon ke vistrut network ke madhyam se vibhinn prakaar kii vasteen tathaa sevaayen uplabdh karakar hamaari aashyakataaon kii purti karata he
 Other words - business, business establishment, firm, xxwrep 6 business, enterprise jab ham apane aasapaas dhyaan dete hai to dekhte hai ki zyaadaatar log kisi na kisi kaam main sanlagn hai
 Teachers teach in schools, farmers work in the fields, laborers work in factories, drivers drive vehicles, shopkeepers sell goods, doctors see patients, etc
 is tarah barhon maheene har aadmi din bhar, yaa kabhi-kabhi raat bhar, kisi na kisi kaam main vyast rahata he
 But now the question arises that why do we all keep ourselves so busy in some work like this? There is only one answer - 'to meet your needs'
 is tarah kaam karke yaa to ham apane vibhinn uttardayitvon kii purti karte hai yaa dhan arjeet karte hai, jisase ki ham apni aavashyaktaa kii vastuen tathaa sevaayen kharid saken
 The various actions performed by human beings are called human actions
 in sabhi kriyaaon ko ham do virgo main baant sakate hai- Activities that are done for the purpose of earning money are called economic activities
 udhaaharan ke liye, kisaan khet main hal chalaakar fasal ugaata he or use bechakar dhan arjeet karata he, kaarkaane athwa karyaalay kaa karmchaaree apane kaam ke badale vetan yaa mazdooree praapt karata he, vyapaaree vastuon ke kray vikray se laabh arjeet karata he
 All these activities are economical
 jo kriyaayein dhan arjeet karne kii apeksha, santushti praapt karne ke uddeshy se kii jaati hai unhen anaarthik kriyaayein kehete hai
 Such actions are done to fulfill social responsibilities, recreation or health benefits
 log puja sthalon par jate hai, baadh athwa bukamp raahat kosh main daan dete hai, swasthya laabh ke liye swayan ko khelkud main vyast rakhte hai, bagwani karte hai, radio sunate hai, televijan dekhte hai yaa isi tarah kii anya kriyaayein karte hai
 These are some examples of uncritical verbs
 aamtaur par aarthik kriyaayein dhan arjeet karne ke uddeshyon se kii jaati he
 Generally people engage in such actions regularly, which is called economic action
 vyavsaay ko is prakaar paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he : The business has the following characteristics: bharat kii saanskrithik dhrohar bahut samrudh he
 But perhaps few people would know that in ancient times India was a very developed country at the level of economy and business
 yah baat aitihaasik saakshyon, khudaai se praapt pramaanon, sahitya va likhit dastavezon se sidhi hoti hai
 Attracted by the immense wealth of India, most of these attacks from time to time by various foreign invaders also prove this fact
 pracheen bhartiya sabhyataa na keval vrufashi aadhaarit thi, balki iske aantarik va bahya vyapaar va vaanijya bhi kaaphi unnat the
 India has immense contribution in various fields of business
 us samay ke anya deshon main prachlit vyavsaayon se tulana karne par ham pate hai ki bhartiya vyavsaay apni vilakshantaa, gatishiltaa ;gatyaatmakataaddh va gunatmakataa main in sabase kahin aage tha
 In the early days, the Indian economy was completely agricultural based
 log apane upbhog kii vastuon kaa utpaadan swayan karte the
 There was no need to sell or exchange goods
 lekin vikaas ke saath-saath logon kii aavashyaktaayen badhane lagi
 Due to which production of goods also increased
 logon ne dainik upyog tathaa vilasita sambandhi vibhinn vastuon ke utpaadan main visheshgyata arjeet kerani shuru kar di or is tarah se unke paas apane upyog kii anya vastuon ke utpaadan ke liye dakshataor samay kaa vyavsaay kii prakruti tathaa kshetra abhaav hona shuru ho gaya
 In this way, their efficiency increased and they were able to produce more items than they needed
 atah apni anya aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye apni adhki utpaadit vastuon ke vinimay kii pranali viksit ho gai
 This was the beginning of trade
 aaj zyaadaatar log yah maanate hai ki bharat main vyavsaay va vyapaar ke kshetra main itnaa vikaas swatantrata prapti ke pashchaat hi hua he
 India has become so capable in industrial production today that we can produce all goods using indigenous technology
 lekin isse yah parinaam nahin nikaal lenaa chahie ki bhoot kaal main bhartiya sabhyataa viksit yaa unnat nahin thi
 While we are still proud of India's rich commercial and commercial heritage
 aap yah jaanakar hairaan honge ki bharat ne vyapaar va vaanijya ke kshetra main apni yatra 5000 varsh i
pus
 shuru kar di thi
 It is proved from many historical evidences that at that time there were well planned cities in India
 bhartiya kapadon, aabhushanon or itra ityadi ke prati puure vishwa main aakarshan tha
 There has also been evidence that for a long time there was a trend among Indian traders to use currency for business
 vyapaariyon, shilpakaaron va utpaadakon ke hiton kii raksha ke liye sanghon ;hanpaskaddh kaa prachlan tha
 This indicates the complex development of trade and commerce in India
 us samay bharat ke vyapaariyon ne na keval sudrudh aantarik vyavsaayik raaston kaa jaal buna tha, balki unke vyavsaayik sambandh arab, madhya va dakshin purv asia ke vyapaariyon se bhi the
 India was also active in the production of various types of metal materials such as copper, brass articles, utensils, jewelry and decorative items etc
 bhartiya vyapaaree vishwa ke vibhinn bhaagon main apane utpaadon kaa niryaat karte the or vahaan se unke utpaadon kaa aayaat karte the
 It is a well-known fact that the British first came to India to do business, who later established their kingdom here
 bharat ne kai prakaar se vishwa vyapaar va vaanijya main yogadan diya he
 The numeral system for calculation, which we still use today, was already developed in India
 sanyukt parivaar pratha tathaa vyavsaay main shram vibhaajan kaa vikaas bhi yaheen hua, jo aaj tak prachlit he
 Today, consumer-centric business techniques used in modern times have been an integral part of Indian business since ancient times
 isliye ham kah sakate hai ki bharat kii apni samrudhi vyavsaayik dhrohar he, jisane isaki unnati main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 All business actions are performed to serve certain purposes
 vyavsaay ke uddeshyon ko nimna prakaar vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he : The economic objectives of the business include all the necessary actions that serve the purpose of making profit, such as creating customers, regular innovation and better utilization of available resources, with the objective of making a profit
 laabh, vyavsaay ke liye jivan daayini shakti kaa kaary karata he
 Without this, no business can survive in the competition market
 vastav main kisi bhi vyavsaayik ikai ke astitv main aane kaa uddeshy hota he- laabh kamanaa
 Profit not only helps the businessman in earning his livelihood, but also helps in expansion of business activities by re-appropriating a part of the profit in the business
 laabh kamaane ke praathmik uddeshy ko praapt karne ke liye vyavsaay ke kuch anya uddeshy nimnlikhit hai : Social objectives are the objectives of business which are necessary to be achieved for the interests of society
 atah har vyavsaay kaa uddeshy hona chahie ki vah kisi bhi prakaar se samaaj ko haani na pahunchaae
 The social objectives of business include production and fulfillment of good quality goods and services, adoption of proper business practices, contribution to the general welfare functions of the society and contribution to welfare facilities
 maanviya uddeshyon se abhipraay un uddeshyon se he, jinamein samaaj ke aksham tathaa viklang, shiksha athwa prashikshan se vanchit logon ke kalyaan tathaa karmchaariyon kii apekshaaon kii purti ke lakshya nihit hote hai
 Thus, the humanitarian objectives of business include economic security of employees, social and psychological satisfaction and development of human resources
 vyavsaay, desh kaa ek mahatvapurn ang hota he atah rashtriya lakshyon or aakankshaon kii prapti prayek vyavsaay kaa uddeshy hona chahie
 The national objectives of the business are: pehle bharat ke anya deshon ke saath bahut hi simit vyapaarik sambandh the
 The policies regarding import and export of goods were very stringent then, but nowadays liberal economic policies have largely eliminated the ban on foreign investment, and the duty on imported goods has also come down considerably
 in parivartanon se bazaar main pratiyogita kaaphi bad gai he
 Today, the whole world has transformed into a big market due to globalization
 aaj ek desh main taiyaar maal duusare desh main aasaani se uplabdh he
 Thus, due to increasing competition in the world market, every business has started working with some purpose in its mind, which can be called a global objective
 log laabh arjeet karne ke uddeshy se vyavsaay chalaate hai
 But making profit alone is not the sole purpose of business
 samaaj kaa ek ang hone ke naate ise bahut se saamaajik kaary bhi karne hote hai
 It also bears the responsibility of looking after the nature and area and community of business, especially the owners, investors, employees and society in general in protecting their existence
 atah prayek vyavsaay ko kisi na kisi rup main inke prati jimmedaariyon kaa nirvaah karnaa chahie
 For example, assuring investors a reasonable rate of return, providing good salaries, security, proper working conditions to their employees, providing good quality goods to their customers at reasonable prices, protecting the environment and so on
 Many tasks should be done
 haalanki aise kaary karte samay vyavsaay ke saamaajik uttardayitvon ke nirvaah ke liye do baton kaa vishesh rup se dhyaan rakhana chahie
 First of all, not every such action is a ritualistic action
 iskaa arth yah he ki yadi koi vyavsaay kisi aspataal athwa mandir yaa kisi skool athwa college ko kuch dhanrashi daan main detaa he to yah uskaa saamaajik uttardaayitv nahin kehalaayegaa, kyonki daan dene se saamaajik uttardayitvon kaa nirvaah nahin hota
 Secondly, such actions should not be good for some people and bad for some people
 maan lijie ek vyapaaree taskari karke yaa apane graahakon ko dhekha dekar bahut sa dhan arjeet kar letaa he or garibon ke mufrat ilaaj ke liye aspataal chalaata he to uskaa yah kaary saamaajik rup se nyyochit nahin he
 Social responsibility means that a businessman should not do anything which is harmful to society while performing social activities
 is prakaar saamaajik uttardaayitv kii avadharna vyavsaayee ko jamkhori va kalabazari, kar chori, milawat, graahakon ko dhekha dena jaisi anuchit vyaparik kriyaaon ke badale vyavsaayee ko vivekpurna prabandhn ke dwaara laabh arjeet karne ke liye protsaahit karti he
 This is possible by providing appropriate work and residential facilities to the employees, providing appropriate after-sales services to the customers, controlling environmental pollution and protecting natural resources
 vyavsaay ke saamaajik uttardaayitv kii avadharna tathaa iske mahatv ke bare main jaankaree praapt kar lene ke baad aaie jaane ki vyavsaay kaa iske vibhinn hit-samoohon, jin par yah ashrith he, ke prati kya uttardaayitv hai
 Business is often dependent on owners, disinvesters, employees, suppliers, customers and consumers, competitors, government and society
 inhen hit-samooh isliye kaha jaataa he, kyonki vyavsaay kii prayek kriya se in samoohon kaa hit, pratyaksh yaa apratyaksh rup se prabhavit hota he
 Responsibilities of business owners: vyavsaay ke apane lendaaron ke prati uttardaayitv haih The business has the following responsibilities towards its employees: vyavsaay ke apane aapurtikarttaaon ke prati uttardaayitv nimnlikhit hai : Following are the responsibilities of the business towards the customers: vyavsaay ke apane pratiyogiyon ke prati nimnlikhit uttardaayitv hai : The following are the various business responsibilities of the government: ek samaaj, vyaktiyon, samoohon, sanghathanon, pariwaron aadi se milakar banataa he
 They are all members of society
 ye sabhi ek duusare ke saath milte-julate hai tathaa apni lagbhag sabhi gatividhiyon ke liye ek duusare par nirbhar hote hai
 There is a connection between all of them, whether direct or indirect
 samaaj kaa ek ang hone ke naate, samaaj ke sadasyon ke bich sambandh banaae rakhane main vyavsaay ko bhi madad kerani chahie
 For this, it is necessary to discharge certain responsibilities towards the society
 ye uttardaayitv nimnlikhit hai : Kherwal Soren is a noted litterateur of the Santali language

 Yamuna is a river in India
 yah ganga nadi kii sabase badi sahaayak nadi he jo yamunotri naamak jagah se nikalati he or prayag main ganga se mil jaati he
 Its major tributaries are Chambal, Sengar, Chhoti Sindh, Batwa and Cane

 Yamuna in Prayag presents as a huge river and merges into the Ganges under the famous historical fort there
 braj kii samskruti main yamuna kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 It originates from a place called Yamunotri
 yah ganga nadi kii sabase badi sahaayak nadi he
 The origin of the Yamuna is the Kalind Mountains, located 7 to 8 miles northwest of the snow-capped monkey range of the Himalayas, 6200 meters in height, after which the Yamuna is called Kalindja or Kalindi
 apane udgam se aage kai mile tak vishaal himagaaron or him mandit kandaraon main aprakat rup se bahati hui tathaa pahari dhalaanon par se atyant tivrathapurvak utarati hui isaki dhara yamunottaree parvat se prakat hoti he
 Thousands of pilgrims arrive from every corner of India every year for its visit
 yamunottaree parvat se nikalakar yah nadi anek pahari daron or ghaatiyon main pravaahit hoti hui tathaa vadier, kamalad, vadari aslor jaisi choti or tons jaisi badi pahari nadiyon ko apane anchal main sametati hui aage badhati he
 After that it leaves the Himalayas and enters the valley of Doon
 vahaan se kai mile tak dakshin-pashchim kii or bahati hui tathaa giri, sirmaur or aashaa naamak choti nadiyon ko apni god main leti hui yah apane udgam se lagbhag 95 mile dur vartmaan saharanpur jila ke faijabad gram ke sameep maidan main aati he
 At that time, the height up to its coast remains about 1276 feet above sea level
 bhuvanbhaskar surya iske pita, mrityu ke devtaa yama iske bhai or bhagwaan shri krishna iske pati sweekaarya kiye gayi hai
 Where Lord Shri Krishna is called the father of Braj culture, Yamuna is considered its mother

 Hence it is called Yamuna Maiya in Braj

 Yamuna river has an average depth of 10 feet and maximum depth of 35 feet
 dilli ke nikat nadi main, yah adhiktam gaharaai 68 feet he
 In Agra, these depths are up to 3 feet
 maidan main jahaan is samay yamuna kaa pravaah he, vahaan vah sadaa se pravaahit nahin hoti rahi he
 It is known from mythological observations and historical references, though the Yamuna has been in existence for thousands of years, its flow has changed from time to time
 apane sudhirdh jivan kaal main isane jitne sthaan badale hai, unamem se bahut kam kii hi jaankaree praapt ho saki he
 In prehistoric times, the Yamuna flowed near Madhuban, where Shatradhan Ji first established the city of Mathura on its banks
 valmiki ramayana or vishnu puraana main iskaa vivaran praapt hota he
 1 During the Krishna period, the flow of Yamuna was close to Katra Keshava Dev
 satrahavin shatabadi main bharat aane vaale europea vidwaan tevernear ne katra ke sameep kii bhoomi ko dekh kar yah anumaan laga liya tha ki vahaan kisi samay yamuna kii dhara thi
 In this context, Grouse is of the opinion that the Yamuna is less likely to flow near Katra in the historical period, but Yamuna was definitely there in very ancient times
 2 isse bhi yah siddh hota he ki krishna kaal main yamuna kaa pravaah katra ke sameep hi tha
 Kannidham estimates, in the time of the Yannani writers, that the main stream of Yamuna or a large branch of it would flow under the eastern wall of Katra Keshav Dev
 3 jav mathura main buddha dharm kaa vyapak prachaar go gaya or yahan yamuna ke donon ore anek sandhaaram banaaye gayi, tav yamuna kii mukhya dhara katra se hatakar praayah usee sthaan par bahati hogi, jahaan vah ab he, kintu uski koi shakha athwa sahaayak nahin katra ke nikat bhi vidhman thi
 It is estimated that that branch of the Yamuna flowed under the Keshav Dev Temple until much later than the Buddhist period, possibly until the sixteenth century
 pehle do barsaati nadiyaan 'saraswati' or 'krishna ganga' mathura ke pashchimi bhaag main pravaahit hokar yamuna main girti thim, jinaki smriti main yamuna ke saraswati sangam or krishna ganga naamak ghat hai
 It is possible that only one of those tributaries of Yamuna flows near Katra
 vallabh sampradaay ke vaarta sahitya se gyaat hota he ki saraswat kalp main yamuna nadi jamunaavati gram ke sameep bahati thi
 At that time, there were two streams of Yamuna river, one stream used to flow near Nandgaon, Varsana, Sanket, on Jamunavati in Govardhan and the other stream went towards Gokul via Pirghat

 He was also a member of England who attended the Paris Peace Conference

 As a student, hard-working and talented Toynbee wanted to become a historian from the beginning
 unhen lagata tha ki itihaas ke dharaatal par duniya main na jane kitna kaam karnaa abhi baaki he
 In 1912, he started working as a teacher at Balliol College
 pratham vishwayuddh ke dauraan british karyaalay ke raajnneetik khufia vibhaag ke liye tathaa 1919 main paris shanti sammelan ke liye ek pratinidhi ke rup main kaary kiya
 But Twanby has the greatest reputation as a great universal historian

 His immortal work "A Study of History" is a highly influential historical study of this century
 inamen vishwa kii 26 sabhyataaon ke vikaas, hraas or patan kaa gaveshnatmak vivechan kiya gaya he
 Twanby has also tried to think of modern Western civilization as neutral
 kintu unka aitihaasik vishleshan mukhyat: dharmik drushti se prabhavit he or unhen itihaas main jeev kii ishwar kii ore pragati dikhaai detii he
 In his view, the defense of Western civilization can only be possible by the re-awakening of Christian religious sentiment
 unak yah nishkarsh sarvamaanya to nahin he, kintu vishwa kii aitihaasik ghatnaon evam pravritiyon kii unki sabhi vyakhyaaon ko akelaa chunauti denevaala koi birla hi vidvan ho saktaa he
 It is difficult to read all the volumes of "A Study of Histy", often without being bored, and the short version with two bindings to Somerville is generally prevalent
 twanbi kii anya pustakon main 'naishanalti and waar', 'di new europe', 'civillijeshan on trial', 'di valdr and di west', 'en historianj aproch tu relijan' ityadi ullekhneey hai
 The historian Joseph Toynbee, who deeply influenced the discipline of historiography in the twentieth century, was not only a rich creator, but his history-vision, like his vast works, represents his attempts to contain all places and periods in his arms
 
 toinbi ne pracheen se lekar aadhunik itihaas par to apni kalam chalaai hi, unhone dharm, samakaleen ghatnakram or itihaas kii prakruti par bhi jam kar likhaa
 He has given the principles of his history in his book a Study of History
 vidwaanon ne is rachana ko oswald spengler kii kriti da dicline of da west jaisaa mana he
 Actually, Spengler and Tynby were contemporaries
 spengler apni yah kriti yuvavastha main likhi thi or toinbi ne praudhavastha main
 The similarity between the two was that both of them put civilization at the center of the study of world history and made the subject of their study
 donon ne hi sabhyataa rupi ikaayiyon ko vibhakt kiya
 Spengler gave her number eight, while Toynbee ranked twenty-three
 spengler ke anusaar sabhyataaen vibhinn nishchit avasthaaon se guzarati hai
 Tynby differs from Spangler's idea, but both agree that Western civilization is undergoing questioning
 toinbi kaa vichaar he ki sabhyataaon ko anushaasit adhyayan ke madhyam se nahin samajha ja saktaa
 They describe their study as experiential
 ve apni kriti ke praarambhik bhaagon main apni baaten kehane ke liye manovigyaan sahit vibhinn saamaajik vigyaanon kaa upyog karte hai
 Believing that different cultures influence each other, Toynbee rejects Spengler's belief that each civilization develops separately and ends with subsequent civilizations
 unka moolbhoot vichaar he ki aitihaasik adhyayan kii sabase choti subodhgamy ikai sampoorn samaaj hota he na ki ek paksheeya rup se nirdhaarit unke kuch ansh jaise aadhunik yug ke raashtra-rajya athwa unani-roman yug ke nagar-rajya
 In the context of civilization, Toynbee's view that the history of all civilizations is parallel and contemporary in certain contexts
 toinbi ne sabhyataaon kii utpatti se judi apni avadharanaon kii roshni main spengler kii daavedaariyon ko matagrahi qaraar diya
 An understanding of the history of all civilizations to be parallel and timely in certain contexts was made by Tynby while teaching his students the history of Thucydidis
 thucididis dwaara 431 isa purv rachi gayi 'history of pelloponisian war' ko toinbi ne helenic samaaj ke vighatan kaa kaal mana
 While teaching Toynbee, he felt that the experience he was experiencing in the modern world from the events of 1914, was experienced by Thyssidis in his day
 is aadhaar toinbi ne apane yug ko aadhunik tathaa thucididis ke yug ko pracheen qaraar dene jaisi avadharana ko nirarthak bataate hue donon yugon kii samakaleenta rekhaankit kii
 Based on this understanding, Toynbee studied greek-roman civilizations and accepted their history as a model for comparative study of civilizations
 toinbi ke aalochakon ke anusaar sabhyataaon kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan siddhant rup main to sambhav he lekin saamagree kii anuplabdhta ke kaaran yah vyavahaaratah asambhav he
 Toynbee acknowledged her criticism, saying that although in some situations every 'event' is unique and incomparable, it can also fall into a particular category in this situation
 koi bhi do jivit sharir-rachanaayen ek jaisi nahin hoti lekin iske baavjood praani vigyaan, vanaspati vigyaan tathaa maanav jati- vigyaan kii vaidhata samaapt nahin hoti
 Toynbee cited Aristotle's three methodologies for understanding human life events and his points of view: ascertaining and collecting facts, interpreting some general rules by comparative study of facts, and 'imagining' facts as facts
 Artistic reconstruction
 toinbi sabhyataaon kii utpatti or vikaas ke sambandh main bhautik yaa bhugolic parivesh ke kaaran nahin maanate hai
 They consider this to be the result of an indivisible element which is of the upper psychological type
 ise spasht karte hue toinbi puraanon kaa aashray lete hai or plato ke hawaale se kehete hai ki vigyaan or myth donon kaa saath-saath prayog avaanchhneeya nahin he
 He asks the scientist to close his eyes to hear the language of the Puranas
 unke anusaar sabhyataaon kii utpatti ke anek kaaran hai
 It is a relationship with no existence in itself
 sristi do alokik vyaktiyon ke milan or unki antalakriyaaon kaa parinaam he
 Every time this scheme grows into a completely different state
 is aadhaar par sabhyataa kii utpatti kaa kaaran ek antalakriya he
 In the course of the development of civilization, Toynbee states that as a social class, individuals face the constant challenges that a civilization develops and this process continues in a procedural manner
 sabhyataa ke vikaas or lakshan ke sambandh main tinabi sainik yaa saamaajik shakti ke vikaas ko sabhyataa ke vikaas ke lakshan ke rup main nahin balki sabhyataa ke patanonmukhi hone kaa sanket maanate hai
 Instead of treating physical development as a sign of civilization, they consider the internal process as the development of civilization
 unke anusaar iske liye aatm-nishchay hi anivaary shart he
 In contrast, according to Spengler, the development of civilization is based on biological principles and its disintegration becomes inevitable
 ek duusare mat ke anusaar prajatigat varna-sanskaar sabhyataa ke vighatan kaa mul kaaran he
 But Toynbee does not consider civilization to be related to the species
 sabhyataa-vighatan ke bare ek siddhant yah bhi rahaa he ki chunki sabhyataa kaa utthan hua he to uskaa vighatan or patan bhi nishchit hoga he
 According to Toynbee, his future horoscope can be made based on the decline of civilizations
 unke anusaar sabhyataa kaa vighatan unka na to ek bhu-kshetra main simit hone ko vajah se hota he or na hi maanav janm yaa naiysargik vipattiyon kii vajah se
 Disintegration of civilization is caused by self-aggression
 unki manyata he ki vyaktiyon main kriyaatmak shakti kaa haas hi sabhyataa ke vighatan kaa mul kaaran he
 He has called it self-defeating
 toinbi kaa vichaar he ki sabhyataa ke vighatan ke daur main samaaj sattadhari alpsankhyak, aantarik sarvhaara or bahya sarvhaara jaise teen bhaangon main bant jaataa he
 Toynbee, unlike Spengler, does not believe that civilization ends after dissolution
 unke vichaar se vighatan ke baad bhi ye bhaag uplabdhi karnaa jari rakhte hai
 At the time of dissolution, the three parts are not in a state of vacuity but all three play an important role
 toinbi maanate hai ki sabhyataa ke vighatan se manushya jin dukhon kaa anubhav karata he, ve anubhav hi pragati kaa kaarak banate hai
 That is, difficulties only teach how to move forward

 On this day, Major E
 Baring, a member of the Governor General's Council of India, announced the opening of telephone exchanges in Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai
 kolkata ke exange kaa naam "kendriya exange" tha jo 7, council house street imaarat kii teesri manzil par kholaa gaya tha
 The Central Telephone Exchange had 93 customers
 bombai main bhi 1882 main telephone exange kaa udghaatan kiya gaya
 In the British era, while all major cities and towns in the country were connected by telephone, in 1948 the total number of telephones was only around 80,000
 swatantraaa ke baad bhi vikaas behad dhimi gati se ho rahaa tha
 The telephone became a symbol of status rather than a means of utility
 telephonon kii sankhya itmeenaan se babbti hui 1971 main 980,000, 1981 main 2
15 million or 1991 main 5
07 million tak pahunchi, jis varsh desh main aarthik sudhaaron ko shuru kiya gaya
 Although some innovative steps were being taken from time to time, such as for example the Telex service in Mumbai in 1953 and the first route between Delhi and Kanpur and Lucknow and Kanpur between 1960, Sam Pitroda started in the eighties
 a wave of change began
 ve taaja hawa kaa jhonka lekar aaye
 The real scenario of change was seen with the announcement of the National Telecom Policy in 1994
 1975 main, doorsanchaar vibhaag ko pi and tii se alag kar diya gaya tha
 The Department of Telecommunications was responsible for all telecom services in the country until 1985, when Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited was separated from the Department of Telecommunications and given the responsibility of running the services of Delhi and Mumbai
 1990 ke dashak main sarkaar dwaara doorsanchaar kshetra ko udaarikaran- nijeekaran- vaishvikaran niti ke tahat nijee nivesh ke liye khol diya gaya
 Therefore, it was necessary to separate the policy branch of the government from its executive branch
 bharat sarkaar ne 1 oktober 2000 ko doorsanchaar vibhaag ke parichaalan hisse ko nigam ke adheen kar use bharat sanchaar nigam limited kaa naam diya
 Many private operators, such as Reliance Communications, Tata Indicom, Hutch, Loop Mobile, Airtel, Idea, etc
 successfully entered the high-potential Indian telecom market
 bharat sarkaar kai guton dwaara bani thi, jinaki vichaardhaaraein alag-alag thim
 Some of them wanted to keep the market open for foreign players, while others wanted the government to regulate the infrastructure and limit the participation of foreign players
 Due to this political background it was very difficult to bring liberalization in telecom
 jab ek vidheyak sansad main paarit kiya gaya tha, use bahumat kaa vot milanaa chahie tha, magar alag-alag vichaardhaaraon vaale dalon kii sankhya ko dekhte hue is tarah kaa bahumat praapt karnaa mushkil tha
 Liberalization began in 1981 when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi signed a merger contract with the state-run telecommunications company with Alcatel CIT of France in an effort to lay 5,000,000 lines every year
 lekin raajnneetik virodh ke kaaran jald hi is niti ko tyaagna padaa
 unhone america sthit apravasi bhartiya sam pitroda ko centre for deveopment of telematics sthapit karne ke liye aamantrit kiya, par raajnneetik dabaavon ke kaaran yah yojana vifal ho gayi
 After the assassination of Indira Gandhi, during this period, under the leadership of Rajiv Gandhi, many public sector organizations such as the Department of Telecommunications, VSNL and MTNL were established
 is kaarykaal main kai takneekee vikaas hue phir bhi videshi khilaadiyon ko doorsanchaar vyapaar main bhaag lene kii anumati nahin thi
 Telephone demand continued to grow
 isi avadhi ke dauraan aisa hua ki 1994 main pien raav ke netritv main sarkaar ne rashtriya doorsanchaar niti lagu kii, jisamen nimnlikhit kshetron: swaamitv, seva or doorsanchaar ke buniyadi dhaanche ke viniman main parivartan laayaa gaya
 He was also successful in establishing joint ventures between state-owned telecom companies and international players
 But still the facility of full ownership was confined to the government owned organizations only
 videshi companiyaan kul hissedari kaa 49% rakhane kii hakdaar thim
 Multi-nationals were involved only in technology transfer, not policy making
 is avadhi ke dauraan vishwa bank or itiu ne bharat sarkaar ko lambii duuri kii sevaaon ko udaar karne kii salaah di thi jisase rajya ke swaamitv vaale doorsanchaar vibhaag or viesanel kaa ekadhikaar khatm ho sake or lambii duuri ke vaahak vyapaar main pratispardhaa bade jisase prashulk kam karne main madad milegi or desh kii arthvyavastha behatar ho sakegi
 raav dwaara chalaai ja rahi sarkaar ne vipareet raajnneetik dalon ko vishwaas main lekar sthaneey sevaaon kaa udaarikaran kiya or 5 saal ke baad lambii duuri ke kaarobaar main videshi bhagidaari dene kaa vishwaas dilaya
 desh ko buniyadi telephoni ke liye 20 doorsanchaar parimandalon or mobile sevaaon ke liye 18 parimandalon main baanta gaya tha
 These circles were divided into A, b and c categories based on the value of revenue in each circle
 sarkaar ne prati parimandal main sarkari swaamitv vaale doorsanchaar vibhaag ke saath prati parimandal ek nijee company ke liye nividaaon ko khulaa rakhaa
 For cellular service, two service providers were allowed per circle and each provider was given a 15-year license
 in sudhaaron ke dauraan, sarkaar ko itiai, doorsanchaar vibhaag, emtnael, viesanel or anya shramik unionon ke virodhon kaa saamana karnaa padaa, lekin vah in baadhaon se nipatane main kaamyaab rahi
 After 1995, the government created TRAI, which reduced government interference in setting tariffs and formulating policies
 doorsanchaar vibhaag ne iskaa virodh kiya
 Political powers changed in 1999 and the new government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee was more supportive of new reforms, which introduced better liberalization policies
 unhone dot ko 2 bhaagon main baanta-1 niti nirmaataa or anya seva pradaata jise baad main beasenel kaa naam diya gaya
 The proposal to increase the share of foreign investors from 49% to 74% was rejected by anti-political parties and leftist thinkers
 gharelu vyapaar samooh chaahate the ki sarkaar viesanel kaa nijeekaran kar de
 Finally in April 2002, the government reduced its stake in VSNL from 53% to 26% and decided to invite it to private enterprises for sale
 ant main tata ne viesanel main 25% hissedari le lee
 It was a gateway for many foreign investors to join the Indian telecom market
 march 2000 ke baad, sarkaar nitiyon ko banane or nijee sanchaalkon ko license jari karne main or adhik udaar ban gayi
 The government further reduced the license fee for cellular service providers and raised the allowable share of foreign companies to 74%

 As a result, in the future, it will be impossible to identify whether the next generation network will be a permanent or mobile network, and wireless learning broadband will be used for both permanent and mobile services
 At that time it will become difficult to distinguish between permanent and mobile networks — as both permanent and mobile users will use the services through a single core network

 Self-gathering are processes that are self-assembled without any external interference, from the existing system in a state of disorder, by local interactions of pre-existing components
 swa-ekathran sthitik yaa gatik ho sakate hai
 Static self-gathering brings balance to a system, which reduces its free energy

 Linguistics scholars are called 'philologists'
 bhashavigyaan, vyakaran se bhinn he
 Functional study of a language is done in grammar while the linguist goes on to do a very comprehensive study of the language
 adhyayan ke anek vishyon main se aajkal bhashaa-vigyaan ko vishesh mahatva diya ja rahaa he
 This language-related study has been named in Europe with many names and nouns till date
 sarvapratham is adhyayan ko philology shabd ke aage visheshan ke rup main ek shabd joda gaya- tab ise ‘‘comparative philology’’ kah kar pukaara gaya
 Until the nineteenth century, grammar and linguistic studies were often considered to be the same
 atah ise vidwaanon ne 'comparative grammer' naam bhi diya
 In France it was named Langistić
 france main bhashaa sambandhi kaary adhik hone ke kaaran unnisvin sadi main sampoorn europe main hi "linguistique" athwa "linguistics" naam hi prachlit rahaa he
 Apart from this, other names like 'science of Language', 'glutology' etc
 also came in handy to reveal this subject
 aaj in sabhi naamon main se ‘‘linguisticks’’, ‘‘philology’’ maatr hi prayog main laae jate hai
 In addition to all these European names in India, the names which are used in Hindi language are as follows - "bhasha-shastra", "bhasha-tattva", "bhasha-sasti", and "" Comparative linguistics "etc
 in sabhi naamon main se sarv prachlit naam ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ he
 All the names, ancient and new, appear to be synonymous in these names
 atah yahi naam is shaastra ke liye sarvatha upyukt prathit hota he
 In its present form, linguistics is said to be the brain of Western scholars
 ati pracheen kaal se hi bhashaa-sambandhi adhyayan kii pravriti sanskrit-sahitya main pai jaati he
 a subtle discussion on language is available in Vedang called 'shiksha'
 dhvaniyon ke uccharan- avyav, sthaan, praytn aadi kaa in granthon main vistrut varnan uplabdh he
 Scientific analysis can be called scientific study of the language on the subjects' etymology, metal, prefix-suffixes etc
 in 'pratishyakhya' and Nirukta
 bhartruhari ke granth ‘vaakya padiya’ ke antargat ‘shabd’ ke swaroop kaa sookshm, gahan evam vyapak chintan uplabdh hota he
 There the word is envisaged as 'brahman' and its 'letter' is described as a noun
 prakaaraantar se yah ek bhashaa-adhyayan sambandhi granth hi he
 In Sanskrit literature, even in philosophical and literary texts, we get indications of language scientific discussions only under the subtle interpretation of the words' meaning ',' rasa ',' bhava ',' language available here and there in Sanskrit literature
 -conceptual material can certainly be called the cornerstone of current linguistics
 aadhunik vishay ke rup main bhashaa-vigyaan kaa sutarapaat europe main san 1786 i0 main sar wiliam jones naamak vidwaan dwaara kiya gaya mana jaataa he
 In the context of the study of Sanskrit language, Sir William Jones had first done a comparative study of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin language and expressed the possibility that at least one of the languages forms the basis of these three languages
 atah in teenon bhashaaon ke bich ek sookshm sambandh sutara avashya vidyaman he
 This type of comparative study of languages became the first step in the field of modern linguistics
 ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ naam main do padon kaa prayog hua he
 "language" and "science"
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko samajhane se purv in donon shabdon se parichit hona aavashyak prathit hota he
 The word 'bhasha' is derived from the Sanskrit "bhash" metal
 jiskaa arth he-vyakt vaak 
 The word 'science' is formed by applying the prefix 'v' and 'lute' from the 'known' metal
 saamaanya rup se ‘bhashaa’ kaa arth he ‘bol chaal kii bhashaa yaa boli’ tathaa ‘vigyaan’ kaa arth he ‘vishesh gyaan’, kintu ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ shabd main prayukt in donon padon kaa spasht or vyapak arth samaj lene par hi ham is naam kii sargarbhitako jaanane main safal honge
 So, here we try to explain the broad meaning of both these terms
 bhashahmanav ek saamaajik praani he
 The need to convey our feelings and thoughts to each other in the society has been felt since time immemorial
 is prakaar bhashaa kaa astitva maanav samaaj main ati pracheen siddh hota he
 Language serves as an important tool for publishing the entire knowledge of human beings, to know the history of civilization and culture
 hamaare purvapurushon se sabhi saadhaaran or asaadhaaran anubhav ham bhashaa ke madhyam se hi jaan sake hai
 Knowledge from all our scriptures and scriptures is dependent on language
 mahakavi dandi ne apane mahaan granth ‘kavyadarsh’ main bhashaa kii mahatta suchit karte hue likhaa haih- That is, this entire Bhuvan would have become dark, if the word-form light in the world was not the light of language
 spasht hi he ki yah kathan maanav bhashaa ko lakshya karke hi kaha gaya he
 The sounds that animals and birds take shelter to express their expressions may be language for them, but due to being ambiguous to humans, scholars have called it 'latent speech', which is language- Nothing matters from the point of view of science
 kyonki ‘avyakt vaak’ main shabd or arth donon hi aspasht bane rahete hai
 Humans also sometimes use signs of limbs, fidgeting, hand-to-feet, face etc
 to express their feelings, but in spite of being a language, it is not 'express speech'
 maanav bhashaa kii sabase badi visheshta yah hoti he ki vah ‘vyakt vaak’ arthath shabd or arth kii spashtataa liye hue hoti he
 According to Patanjali, the author of Mahabhashya, 'express speech' refers to the descriptive language
 yah satya he ki kabhi-kabhi sanketon or angabhangimaaon kii sahaayta se bhi hamaare bhav or vichaaron kaa preshan badi saralata se ho jaataa he
 In this way, those gestures become symbols of language, but the most appropriate means of expressing human emotion is the descriptive language which has been given the noun of 'express speech'
 is main vibhinn arthon ko prakat karne ke liye kuch nischit uccharit yaa kathith dhvaniyon kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 Therefore, language is called a group of words which are filled with signs of different meanings
 jinke dwaara ham apane manobhaav saralata se dusron ke prati prakat kar sakate hai
 Thus, while defining the language, we can call it a medium adopted to exchange thoughts and expressions in human society, which holds the meaningful basis for the sounds that have been effortlessly ejected from the utterances of humans
 wo dhwani-samooh shabd kaa rup tab lete hai jab ve kisi arth se jud jate hai
 Entire phonology is based on a 'random' relationship with its meaning
 ‘yadrichhik’ kaa arth he purnataya kalpit
 In short, we call that word group pronounced with different meanings expressed in different meanings through which we convey our feelings and thoughts to others
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan se hamen anek laabh hote hai, jaise- 1
 Satisfaction of curiosity or elimination of doubts about your familiar language
 2
 aitihaasik tathaa pragaitihaasik samskruti kaa parichay

 5
 Development of a language for the world
 6

 7
 Assistance in the development and manufacture of translation and self-typing and similar machines
 8
 bhashaa, lipi aadi main saralata, shuddhta aadi kii drushti se parivartan-parivardhan main sahaayta
 In view of all these benefits, linguistics is considered to be a very useful subject in today's era, and its field of study is constantly developing
 bhashaa ek prakritik vastu he jo maanav ko ishwariya vardaan ke rup main mili hui he
 Language is formed by naturally sounding sounds from the mouth of man
 bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan iske bolne or sunne vaale sabhi ko ho jaataa he
 This is called general knowledge of language
 iske aage, bhashaa kab bani, kaise bani ? iskaa praarambhik evam pracheen swaroop kya tha ? isamen kab-kab, kya-kya parivartan hue or un parivartanon ke kya kaaran hai ? athwa kul milakar bhashaa kaise viksit hui ? us vikaas ke kya kaaran hai ? koun si bhashaa kis duusari bhashaa se kitni samanta yaa vishmata rakhti he ? yah sab bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan yaa ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ kaha jayega
 This particular form of linguistics, ie linguistics, has been considered as an important subject of study today
 bhashaa-vigyaan jab adhyayan ke vishyon main badi-badi kakshaon ke paathyakramon ke antargat sammilit kiya gaya to sarvapratham yah ek swaabhaavik prashn utpann hua ki bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala ke antargat gina jaae yaa vigyaan main
 That is, linguistics is art or science
 adhyayan kii prakriya evam nishkarshon ko lekar nishchay kiya jane laga ki vastutah use bhautik vigyaan, evam rasayan vigyaan aadi kii bhanti vishuddh vigyaan mana jaae athwa chitra, sangeet, murti, kavy aadi kalaon kii bhanti kala ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaae
 Art is related to human beings objects or subjects
 yahi kaaran he ki kala vyakti pradhan yaa purnatah vaiyaktik hoti he
 Apart from being relative, a particular country and period also have an influence on art
 iskaa abhipraay yah he ki kisi kaal main kala ke prati jo mulya rahete hai unamem kaalaantar main naye-naye parivartan upasthit ho jate hai tathaa ve kisi duusare desh main bhi maan liye jaaen, yah bhi aavashyak nahin he
 a person is feeling high artistic expression in an object
 kintu duusare ko vah is prakaar kii na lag rahi ho
 Therefore, the perception of art varies from person to person
 kala kaa sambandh maanav hriday kii ragatmik vritti se hota he
 There is a mixture of aesthetics of the person in it
 kala kaa uddeshy bhi soundaryanubhuti karana, yaa anand pradaan karnaa he, kisi vastu kaa tathvik vishleshan karnaa nahin
 The test of all these characteristics of the nature of art shows that linguistics is not art
 kyonki uskaa sambandh hriday kii sarasata-vritti se na hokar buddhi kii tatvagrahi drushti se hota he
 The aim of linguistics is not to provide beauty or entertainment
 vah to hamaare bauddhik chintan ko prakhar banaata he
 Elemental assessment of the existence of language
 uskaa drushtikon buddhivaadee he
 The findings of linguistics do not change on the basis of any person, nation or period and the basic basis of the study of linguistics, which is language, is not a humanized substance
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham kala ke kshetra main nahin gin sakate
 The usefulness of linguistics is that it teaches the art of language teaching
 isi kaaran sweet ne vyakaran ko bhashaa ko kala tathaa vigyaan donon kaha he
 Pure pronunciation, effective use of language can be placed in the category of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala kii seemaa main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, yah nishchay ho jane par yah prashn uthta he ki kya bhashaa-vigyaan, bhautik-shaastra, rasayan-vigyaan aadi vishyon kii bhanti purnatah vigyaan he ? In the belief of many scholars, linguistics is not a pure science
 unki dharna ke anusaar abhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi prayog purnataa ko praapt nahin hue hai or uske nishkarshon ko isiilie antim nishkarsh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 At the same time, not all conclusions of linguistics are as universal and eternal as science
 jis prakaar ganit shaastra main 2 + 2 = 4 saarvkalik, vikalparahit nishkarsh he jo sarvatra sweekaar kiya jaataa he, bhashaa-vigyaan ke paas is prakaar ke vikalp-rahit nirvivaad nishkarsh nahin he
 In science, facts are compiled and analyzed, and the laws of sound are mostly non-committal, so according to some scholars, linguistics can be placed between humanities and science
 vichaar karne par ham dekhte hai ki vigyaan kii aaj kii durat pragati main prayek vishesh gyaan apane aagaamee gyaan ke saamne purana or avaigyanik siddh hota ja rahaa he
 In today's era of continual innovators, the scientific view is constantly going from micro to micro and new to new
 aaj ke viksit gyaan-kshetra ko dekhte hue kai vaigyanik manyataayen puraani or feeki pad gai he
 Newton's theory of light is also now being viewed with suspicion
 isse yah siddh hota ho jaataa he ki nutan gyaan ke prakaash main puraatan gyaan bhi vigyaan ke kshetra se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 Therefore, considering it from the point of view of pure knowledge, we find linguistics within the range of science itself
 bhashaa-vigyaan nishchay hi ek vigyaan he jiske antargat ham bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan praapt karte hai
 It is true that linguistics has not yet been fully developed on a scientific level
 yahi kaaran he ki prasiddh grim-niyam ke aage chal kar grassmaan or varnor ko usamen sudhaar karnaa padaa he
 Prior to the above reforms, the sound rule of Grimm was considered to be the definite rule and even after the reforms it is considered to be the definite rule
 is prakaar naye gyaan ke prakaash main puraane siddhanton kaa khandan hone se vigyaan kaa koi virodh nahin he
 Actually this is pure science
 san 1930 ke baad jahaan varnanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan ko punah mahatva praapt hua, vahaan tab se lekar aaj tak drut gati main vikaas hua he
 Ever since new tests have started with the help of instruments in the field of sound and the conclusions obtained have started to be completely regular, since then linguistics has gradually started to be considered in the category of science
 vigyaan kii ek badi visheshta he uskaa prayogtmak hona
 After American scholar Baloom Field, American linguists have developed experimental linguistics with great intensity as a new method of linguistics with phonology and morphology etc
 is paddati ke antargat bhashaa-vigyaan prayogshaalaon kaa vishay banataa ja rahaa he or uske liye anek yantron kaa avishkaar ho gaya he
 Seeing this, this subject will definitely be called science, there is no doubt in it at all
 aajkal jabaki samaaj-vigyaan, manovigyaan aadi shastreey vishyon ke liye jahaan vigyaan shabd kaa prayog karne kii parampara chal padi he tab shuddh kaaran-kaary parampara par aadhaarit bhashaa-vigyaan ko vigyaan kahana kisi bhi drushti se anuchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has written in his book Language Secret- mangal dev shastri ke shabdon main- This definition is given in Dr
 Bholanath Tiwari's 'linguistics' text as follows- upar di gai sabhi paribhaashaon par vichaar karne se gyaat hota he ki unamem paraspar koi antar nahin he
 In the definition of Dr
 Shyamsunder Das, where the focus has been on linguistics only, Mangaldev Shastri and Bholanath Tiwari have included the types of study of linguistics in their definitions
 paribhaasha vah acchhee hoti he jo sankshipt ho or spasht ho
 Thus, we can give a new definition of linguistics in this way - "the study by which the study of human languages is subtle and analytical is called linguistics
" ” In other words, linguistics is that in which subtle and extensive scientific study of human languages is done
 bhashaa ke prachlit vartmaan swaroop ko chhod kar shesh sari adhyayan saamagree bhashaa-vigyaan ko sahitya se hi uplabdh hoti he
 If Sanskrit, Greek and Avesta literature were not in front of us today, linguistics would never have been successful in knowing that these three languages originated from any one native language
 isi prakaar adikaal se lekar aadhunik kaal tak kaa hindi sahitya hamaare saamne na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan hindi bhashaa ke aitihaasik vikaas kaa adhyayan kis prakaar kar paata
 Linguistics to study language in any way, he has to take help of literature on foot
 bundelkhand ke natkhat baalkon ke munh se yah sun kar- The grammar says what a problem this is, only the study of ancient literature will tell him that this is the impaired form of the first sutra of Shaktayan, 'un Namah Siddham'
 sahitya bhi bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se apni anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan khojane main safal ho jaataa he

 Vasudev Sharan Aggarwal has clarified their meanings by linking many words of 'padmavat' with their original forms, validated on the basis of linguistic principles
 saath hi shuddh paath ke nirdhaaran main bhi isse paryaapt sahaayta lee he
 Hence, both literature and linguistics are supportive of each other
 bhashaa hamaare bhaavon-vichaaron arthath man kaa pratibimb hoti he atah bhashaa kii sahaayta se bahut se samasyaon ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Economics in particular is completely based on psychology
 vaakya-vigyaan ke adhyayan main bhi manovigyaan se paryaapt sahaayta milti he
 Sometimes psychology also helps us to know the cause of sound changes
 bhashaa kii utpatti tathaa praarambhik rup kii jaankaree main bhi bal-manovigyaan tathaa aviksit logon kaa manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Psychology also has to seek help from linguistics in its medical practice to know the meaning of the patient
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se ek manovigyaani rogi kii manogranthiyon kaa pataa lagane main safal ho saktaa he
 Due to the close relationship between linguistics and psychology, a new study method is being developed nowadays called Language Psychology or Psycholinguistics
 bhashaa mukh se nikalne vaali dhwani ko kehete hai atah bhashaa-vigyaan main hawa bheetar se kaise chalati he, swaryantr, swartantri, nasikavivar, kauwa, taalu, daant, jeebh, onth, kanth, moorddha tathaa naak ke kaaran usamen kya parivartan hote hai tathaa kaan dwaara kaise dhwani grahan kii jaati he, in sabakaa adhyayan karnaa padataa he
 Physiology only helps him in this
 likhit bhashaa kaa grahan aankh dwaara hota he or is prakriya kaa adhyayan bhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat hi hota he
 For this also he has to be indebted to physiology
 bhashaa-vigyaan or bhugol kaa bhi-gaharaa sambandh he
 According to some people, the geographical conditions of a place have a profound influence on its language
 kisi sthaan main boli jane vaali bhashaa main vahaan ke ped-paudhe, pakshi, jeev-jantu evam ann aadi ke liye shabd avashya milte hai parantu yadi unamem se kisi kii samaapti ho jaae to uskaa naam vahaan kii bhashaa se bhi juda ho jaataa hai
 The word 'somlata' is not used in our language today
 is lop kaa kaaran sambhavtah bhugolic hi he
 Geographic conditions are also the result of lack of a language spread in a place, less development in language and many dialects in a place
 durgam parvaton par rahane vaali jatiyon kaa paraspar kam sampark hone ke kaaran unki boli prasar nahin kar paati
 The dialect of people living across rivers differs from the common language
 deshon, nagaron, nadiyon tathaa praanton aadi ke naamon kaa bhashaa-vaigyanik adhyayan karne main bhugol badi manoranjak saamagree pradaan karata he
 Even in the field of economics, geography helps linguistics
 ‘ushtr’ kaa arth bhainsa se oont kaise ho gaya tathaa ‘saindhav’ kaa arth ghoda or namak hi kyon hua, aadi samasyaon par vichaar karne main bhi bhugol sahaayta karata he
 language-geography, a branch of linguistics, is just like geography
 isi prakaar kisi sthaan ke pragautihaasik kaal ke bhugol kaa adhyayan karne main bhashaa-vigyaan bhi paryaapt sahaayak hota he
 History is also closely related to linguistics
 itihaas ke teen roopon raajnneetik itihaas, dharmik itihaas, saamaajik itihaas-ko lekar yahan bhashaa-vigyaan se uskaa sambandh dikhalaayaa ja rahaa he- Other areas of knowledge like logic, physics and anthropology also provide great help in the study of linguistics
 manushya main anek prakaar ke andhvishwaas ghar kar lete hai jinka uski bhashaa par prabhaav padataa he
 In Indian society, women take their husbands' names in a twisted way, not outright
 raatri main vishaal keedon kaa naam nahin liya jaataa he
 They name their boy Mange, Chedi, Bechu, Ghurahu, Katwaru Alichar or Lendha, etc
 andhvishwaason ke atirikt anya bahut si saamaajik-manovigyaan se sambaddh gutthiyon ke spashtikaran ke liye maanav-vigyaan kii shakha-prashakhaon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 In this way, many fields of knowledge- culture-studies, pedagogy, statistics, text-science, etc
 have a deep connection with linguistics
 maanav kii bhashaa kaa jo kshetra he vahi bhashaa-vigyaan kaa kshetra he
 The languages and dialects of civilized and uncivilized humans around the world are studied under linguistics
 is prakaar bhashaa-vigyaan keval sabhy-saahitiyik bhashaaon kaa hi adhyayan nahin karata apitu asabhy-barbar-asaahitiyik boliyon kaa, jo prachlan main nahin he, ateet ke garv main khoi hui hai un bhashaaon kaa bhi adhyayan iske antargat hota he
 Linguistics is divided into language structure and 'study of meaning' from the point of view of subject division
 isamen bhashaa kaa vaigyanik drushtikon se vishleshan or varnan karne ke saath hi vibhinn bhashaaon ke bich tulanaatmak adhyayan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Linguistics has two sides - elemental and applied
 iske atirikt bhashavigyaan kaa gyaan-vigyaan kii anyaanya shakhaon ke saath gaharaa sambandh he
 This has led to the development of various branches of sociolinguistics, psychodynamics, academic linguistics, etc
 bhashavigyaan ke gaun kshetra nimnlikhit hai- Syntax: In language, all thought-exchange is done on the basis of sentences
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke jis vibhaag main is par vichaar kiya jaataa he use vaakya-vichaar yaa vaakya-vigyaan kehete hai
 It has three forms - vaakya-rachana kaa sambandh bolanewaale samaaj ke manovigyaan se hota he
 Therefore this branch of linguistics is very difficult
 rup-vigyaan : vaakya kii rachana padon yaa roopon ke aadhaar par hoti he
 Therefore, the idea of verse or form becomes important after a sentence
 rup-vigyaan ke antargat dhaatu, upsarg, pratyay aadi un sabhi upkarnon par vichaar karnaa padataa he jinase rup banate hai
 Phonology: The base word of form or verse
 shabdon par rachana yaa itihaas in do drushtiyon se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The idea of a person or language is also done under it
 kosh-nirmaan tathaa vyutpatti-shaastra shabd-vigyaan ke hi vichaar-kshetra kii seemaa main aate hai
 The cultural history of the speaker can be known on the basis of the word group of the language
 dhwani-vigyaan : shabd kaa aadhaar he dhwani
 Sounds are studied in many ways under phonology
 iske antargat dhwani-shaastra ek alag se upavibhag he jisamen dhwani utpann karne vaale angon-mukh-vivar, nasika-vivar, swar tantri, dhwani yantra ke saath-saath sunne kii prakriya kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 There are two forms of this study - historical and second comparative
 grim niyam kaa sambandh isi se he
 Economics: The outer part of the sentence ends on the sound
 It is the outer body of the language, next to it the field of his soul begins which we call the meaning
 arth-rahit shabd atmarahit sharir kii bhanti vyarth hota he
 Therefore, meaning is an important part of language
 arth-vigyaan main shabdon ke arthon kaa vikaas tathaa uske kaarnon par vichaar kiya jaataa he
 We call any study a scientist when we follow a certain process in it
 bhashaa vigyaan bhi kisi bhashaa ke kaaran-kaaryparak yuktipurna vivechan-vishleshan ke liye kuch nishchit prakriyaaon main bandha kar chalata he
 On the basis of these processes, so far we have received five types of studies of linguistics- saamanyatya bhashaa kaa adhyayan nimnaankit drushtiyon se kiya jaataa he : By descriptive method, the form of one language of the same period is analyzed
 iske liye isamen un siddhanton par prakaash daalaa jaataa, jinke aadhaar par bhashaa-vishesh kii rachanaagat visheshtaon ko spasht kiya ja sake
 It is important to note that in this method language cannot be included in different periods simultaneously, because the analysis of language of every age will have the purpose of separate principles
 panini na keval bharat ke, apitu sansar ke sabase bade bhashavigyaani hai, jinhone varnanaatmak rup main bhashaa kaa vishad evam vyapak adhyayan kiya
 Katyayan and Patanjali also fall in this category
 greek vidwaanon main thraiks, discolas tathaa erodian ne bhi is kshetra main ullekhya kaary kiya tha
 Fully influenced by Panini, Bloomfield paved the way for the development of descriptive linguistics by publishing his book 'language' in 1932 AD
 idhar pashchimi deshon - visheshkar america main varnanaatmak bhashavigyaan kaa aashaatheet vikaas hua he
 The purpose of historical linguistics is to consider changes in different periods in a language and to formulate theories in relation to those changes
 varnanaatmak paddati kaa mul antar yah he ki varnanaatmak paddati jahaan ekakalik he, vahaan aitihaasik paddati dvikalik
 The antiquity of the Sanskrit language attracted the attention of linguists towards the historical method
 'filology' kaa mukhya pratipaadya pracheen granthon kii bhashaaon kaa tulanatamak adhyayan hi tha
 The focus of the scholars was mainly on languages like Sanskrit, German, Greek, Latin
 fredrick ougust woolf ne san 1777 i
 main hi aitihaasik paddati kii ore vidwaanon kaa dhyaan aakrisht kiya tha
 In fact, to understand the developmental form of any language one has to resort to historical method
 puraani hindi athwa madhyakaalin hindi or aadhunik hindi main kya parivartan hua he, ise aitihaasik paddati dwaara hi spasht kiya ja saktaa he
 Two or more languages are compared by comparative method
 ise mishrit paddati bhi kah sakate hai, kyonki vivarnaatmak paddati tathaa aitihaasik paddati donon kaa aadhaar liya jaataa he
 One has to define a period for description and at least two languages are required for comparison
 is prakaar, tulanaatmak paddati ko varnanaatmak paddati or aitihaasik paddati kaa yoga kaha ja saktaa he
 The comparative method can apply to any two languages
 jaise, bhartiya bhashaaon - bhojpuri aadi main bhi paraspar tulana kii jaati he yaa phir hindi-angareji, hindi-roosi, hindi-farsi kaa bhi tulanaatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 That is, there is no territorial limit
 wiliam jones, france bopp, maxmooler, curtius, ougust shlikhar prabhruti vidwaanon ne tulanaatmak bhashavigyaan ke vikaas main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya he
 However, so far there is a great lack of principles in comparative linguistics, on the basis of which the classification of two different languages could not become scientific
 sanrachanaatmak paddati varnanaatmak paddati kii agali kadi he
 This method is getting special publicity in America
 isamen yantric upkarnon ko adhik mahatva diya ja rahaa he, jisase anuwaad karne main vishesh suvidha hogi
 Jaelig Harris developed this method by writing a book titled 'methods in Structural Linguistics'
 vigyaan kii anya shakhaon ke samaan bhashavigyaan ke bhi prayogtmak paksh hai, jinke liye prayog kii pranaaliyon or prayogshaala kii apeksha hoti he
 Phonetic phonology, physical phonology and auditory phonology are studied by various mechanical experiments
 ise praayogic swanvigyaan, yantric swanvigyaan yaa prayogshaala swanvigyaan bhi kehete hai
 In this, from simple equipment like mirrors to the most complex electrical devices are being used
 parinamswaroop bhashavigyaan ke kshetra main ganitagyon, bhautikashastriyon or enginiaron kaa purna sahyog apekshit ho gaya he
 With the help of the artificial palate and artificial palate projectors, the pronunciation space of the unmarked swans is tested by the individual

 Apart from these, there are other small and large instruments, from which adequate help is being taken in linguistic studies
 francisi bhashavaigyanikon main ruiyo ne swanvigyaan ke prayogon ke vishay main granth likhaa tha
 In London, Prof
 Firth developed a special palate
 swaron ke maapan ke liye jaise swaratrikon yaa chatushkon kii rekhaayen nirdhaarit kii gai hai, vaise hi inhone vyanjanon ke maapan ke liye aadhaar rekhaon kaa nirupan kiya, jinke dwaara uccharan sthanon kaa thik thik varnan kiya ja saktaa he
 Daniel Janse and Ida Ward have also done important work on English phonology
 francisi, german or roosi bhashaaon ke swanvigyaan par kaam karne waalon main kramash: armastrong, bithel or boyanas mukhya hai
 Among the people who work on theoretical and applied phonology equally, the following are the main ones: Stetson, Negus Potter, Green and Cop, Martin Juice, Hefner, Maul etc

 rekhiy bi ek aksharmala par aadhaarit lipi thi jiskaa prayog pracheen yunaan main misinian unani likhane ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 It was in vogue many centuries before the Greek alphabet and with the decline of the Mycenaean culture, its use also ended
