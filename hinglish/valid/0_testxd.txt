 Although a large part of this literature is Jainism, it reflects the folk life of the time, as is rare elsewhere
 isamen nanakalin evam nanadeshiy aitihaasik, raajnneetik, aarthik, saamaajik aadi mahatvapurn jhaankiyaan dikhaai detii he jinka bhartiya itihaas main yathochit moolyankan karnaa abhi shesh he
 Apart from languages, this literature can provide valuable help in clearly understanding the tradition of religious, philosophical and moral development of the country and its kernels
 yah mahatvapurn sahitya abhi tak purnat: prakashit nahin ho sakaa he
 Critical edits of the part that have been published have also been reduced, scientific and comparative studies are also very much left
 konkani goa, maharashtra ke dakshini bhaag, karnataka ke uttari bhaag, kerala ke kuch kshetron main boli jaati he
 Linguistically it belongs to the 'arya' language family and is closely related to Marathi
 rajnatik taur par is bhashaa ko apni pahchaan ke liye marathi bhashaa se kaaphi sangharsh karnaa padaa he
 Konkani now ranks in the Eighth Schedule under the Indian Constitution
 1987 main goa main konkani ko marathi ke baraabar rajbhasha kaa darja diya gaya kintu lipi par asahmati ke kaaran ajtak is par amal nahin kiya ja sakaa
 Konkani has been written in many scripts; Such as - Devanagari, Kannada, Malayalam and Roman
 goa ko rajya kaa darja milane ke baad davanagari lipi main konkani ko vahaan kii rajbhasha ghoshit kiya gaya he
 The dialects prevalent in the Konkan region on the west coast of India are commonly called Konkani
 aitihaasik or saanskrithik sambandhon ke parinamswaruva is pradesh main boli janevaali bhashaa ke teen rup hai- The state of Goa was under Portugal for many centuries
 vahaan portugaliyon ne jor jabardasti ke bal par logen se dharmaparivartan karaayaa or unke mul saanskrithik rup ko chhin-bhinn karne kaa prayaas kiya
 Despite all this, people did not abandon their mother tongue
 ulte apane dharmopadesh ke nimitt isai padariyon ne vahaan kii boli main apane ganth rache
 New Christians who converted were often illiterate people
 unhen isai dharm kaa tatv samajhane ke liye portugali padariyon ne konkani kaa aashray liya
 In ancient times, the language that was spoken in the terrain from Goa to Sashti was considered by the people as pure Konkani and called it Gomantaki, however till the sixteenth century there was no specific name for it
 portugaliyon ko jaisaa samaj main aayaa, vaisaa hi naam use diya or pukaara
 It is named Kanari in the writings of the Jesuit priests of 1553 AD
 17veen shatee main padri steffens ne dautrin christaan naamak pustak likhi
 In it he said that he wrote it in Kanari and the grammar of Gomantaki dialect he prepared, he named it 'grammar of Kanari language'
 is kanari shabd kaa sambandh kannada se tanik bhi nahin he
 But it is believed that due to the language of the sea shore, it was called Kanari
 tom pirish naamak yatri ne apni pustak ‘sum oriental’ main, jo 1515 i
 main likhi gai thi, goa kii boli kaa naam konkoni diya he
 In 1658, the Jesuit priest Miglade Almaid also used the word 'konkani' for gomantaki
 ab yah shabd praaia: puure konkan pradesh kii bhashaa ke liye prayukt hota he
 Some people consider it as the dialect of Marathi and some of Kannada
 kuch anya bhashavaigyanik ise aryvansh se udbhoot swatantra samrudh bhashaa bataate he
 There is no written literature available in this language before the seventeenth century
 is bhashaa ke saahitiyik prayog kaa shrey isai mishnariyon ko he
 Pastor Stifes's book Dautrin Christta is the first book in this language written in 1622 AD
 uske baad 1640 i
 main unhone portugali bhashaa main iskaa vyakaran 'arti da lingav kanari’ naam se likhaa
 Before 1563, a dictionary of this language was prepared by a local converting resident and many texts of Christianity were written
 portugali shashan ke parinamswaroop sahitya nirmaan kii gati atyant mand rahi kintu ab is bhashaa ne ek samrudh sahitya kii bhashaa kaa rup dhaaran kar liya he
 Folktales, folklore, folklore have been collected, modern dramas and unicorns have also been composed
 anya vidhaon main bhi rachanaayen kii jane lagi he
 Evidence in Indian philosophy is called that which helps in knowledge of truth
 arthath vah baat jisase kisi duusari baat kaa yatharth gyaan ho
 Evidence is the main subject of justice
 'prama' naam he yatharth gyaan kaa
 Whatever is the cause of real knowledge, that is, through which there is accurate knowledge, it is called proof
 gautam ne chaar pramaan maane hai- pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan or shabd
 The 'real experience' is called 'prama'
 'smriti' tathaa 'sanshay' aadi ko 'prama' nahin maanate
 Therefore, the meaning of unknown element is called 'prama'
 is anadhigat arth ke gyaan ke utpann karne vaala karan 'pramaan' he
 It is said in the Shastradipika - indriyon ke saath sambandh hone se kisi vastu kaa jo gyaan hota he vah pratyaksh he
 The knowledge generated by direct knowledge of both sexes and lingas is called inference
 kisi jaani hui vastu ke saadrishy dwaara duusari vastu kaa gyaan jis pramaan se hota he vah upmaan kehalaata he
 For example, indigo is like a cow
 aapt yaa vishwaasapaatr purush kii baat ko shabd pramaan kehete hai
 In addition to these four proofs, Mimansak, Vedanti and Puranikas consider four more types of proofs - Etihya, Arthapati, Possible and unavailability or absence
 jo baat keval parampara se prasiddh chali aati he vah jis pramaan se maani jaati he usko aitihya pramaan kehete hai
 Economics are the evidence for the matter of which there is objection in the meaning of anything without being seen or heard
 jaise, motaa devdatt din ko nahin khaataa, yah jaanakar yah maananaa padataa he ki devdatt raat ko khaataa he kyonki bina khaae koi motaa ho nahin saktaa
 The evidence that proves the existence of the organ within the wider organ is called possible evidence
 jaise, ser ke bheetar chhataank kaa hona
 The absence of something which proves it is a proof of absence
 jaise chuuhe nikalakar baithe hue hai isse billi yahan nahin he
 But the naturalists do not consider these four as separate evidence, they believe them under their four proofs
 bhartiya darshan ke vibhinn sampradaayon main pramaanon kii sankhya bhinn-bhinn he
 In each of the philosophies, which evidence has been captured, it is given below- inamen se aatma, man or indriya kaa sanyog rup jo gyaan kaa karan vaa pramaan he vahi pratyaksh he
 Being aware of the senses coinciding with the object, it is called 'direct'
 yah pramaan sabase shreshth mana jaataa he
 Gautama has said in the Nyasutra that the knowledge of any substance through the senses is evident
 jaise, yadi hamen saamne aag jalati hui dikhaai de athwa ham uske taap kaa anubhav karen to yah is baat kaa pratyaksh pramaan he ki 'aag jal rahi he'
 In this knowledge, there should be a direct relation between matter and sense
 yadi koi yah kahe ki 'vah kitaab puraani he' to yah pratyaksh pramaan nahin he; kyonki isamen jo gyaan hota he, vah keval shabdon ke dwaara hota he, padaarth ke dwaara nahin, isiliye yah shabdpraman ke antargat chalaa jaayga
 But if the same book comes in front of us and appears dirty or torn, then we must have a direct knowledge that 'this book is old'
 pratyaksh gyaan kisi ke kahe hue shabdon dwaara nahin hota, isi se use 'avyapadeshy' kehete hai
 The direct is said to be unfaithful because it has the same knowledge of what it is
 kuch naiyayik is gyaan ke karan ko hi pramaan maanate hai
 According to his opinion, 'direct evidence' is sense, knowledge generated from sense is 'direct knowledge'
 par avyapadeshy pad se sutarakaar kaa abhipraay spasht he ki vastu kaa jo nirviklpak gyaan he vahi pratyaksh pramaan he
 New writers combine both views and say that there are three reasons for direct knowledge
 pehali avasthaa main jab keval indriya hi karan ho to uskaa fal vah pratyaksh gyaan hoga jo kisi padaarth ke pehle pahal saamne aane se hota he
 Like, something appears in front of her
 is gyaan ko 'nirviklpak gyaan' kehete hai
 In the second stage, it seems that what is in front is a book
 yah 'saviklpak gyaan' hua
 The reason for this knowledge is the relation of sense
 jab indriya ke sambandh se utpann gyaan karan hota he, tab yah gyaan ki yah kitaab acchhee he athwa buree he, pratyaksh gyaan hua
 This direct knowledge is of 6 types - pratyaksh ko lekar jo gyaan ko anumaan kehete hai
 For example, we have seen that where there is smoke, there is fire
 isi ko naiyayik 'vyapti gyaan' kehete hai jo anumaan kii pehali seedhee he
 We have seen fume somewhere, the fire with which we have always seen fire is here
 iske ananthar hamen yah gyaan yaa anumaan utpann hua ki 'yahan aag he'
 Three sections are enough for us to understand, but the task of the Nyayikas is to impart knowledge in the mind of the other, by this they do five sections of conjecture which are called 'components'
 atah anumaan kaa puraa rup yon hua— yahan par aag he 
 Because there is smoke here
 jahaan jahaan dhooaan rahata he vahaan vahaan aag rahati he, 'jaise rasoi ghar main' 
 There is smoke here
 isiliye yahan par aag he 
 Ordinarily, a sentence consisting of these five components is called justice
 naveen naiyayik in paanchon avyavon kaa maananaa aavashyak nahin samajhate
 They quite understand these three vows for proof, for and parable
 mimasak or vedanti bhi inhen teenon ko maanate hai
 Buddhists believe only two, vows and for
 'dusht hetu' ko hetvabhaas kehete hai par iskaa pramaan gautam ne pramaan ke antargat na kar ise alag padaarth maanakar kiya he
 Similarly, deceit, caste, niggestion, etc
 can also be said to be genuine
 keval hetu kaa acchhee tarah vichaar karne se anumaan ke sab dosha pakde ja sakate hai or yah maaloom ho saktaa he ki anumaan thik he yaa nahin
 Gautama's third proof is 'upaman'
 kisi jaani hui vastu ke saadrishy se na jaani hui vastu kaa gyaan jis pramaan se hota he vahi upmaan he
 For example, Nilgai is similar to cow
 kisi ke munh se yah sunakar jab ham jangal main nilgai dekhte hai tab chat hamen gyaan ho jaataa he ki 'yah nilgai he'
 This showed that the relation of an object with its name is a matter of sub-knowledge
 vaisheshik or buddha naiyayik upmaan ko alag pramaan nahin maanate, pratyaksh or shabd pramaan ke hi antargat maanate hai
 They say that 'the word is like a cow', it is the word or the foreknowledge because it happened by the word saying that the person who is an object or confidant, then after that this knowledge is 'this animal which we see is similar to the cow' Knowledge happened
 iskaa uttar naiyayik yah dete hai ki yahan tak kaa gyaan to shabd or pratyaksh hi hua par iske ananthar jo yah gyaan hota he ki 'isi jantu kaa naam gavay he' vah na pratyaksh he, na anumaan, na shabd, vah upmaan hi he
 Upman is thus conjectured by many new philosophers
 ve kehete hai ki 'is jantu kaa naam gavay hai', 'kyonki yah go ke sadrush he' jo jo jantu go ke sadrush hote he unka naam gavay hota he
 But the answer is that 'those animals who are like cow are gay', it does not come to mind, it only comes to mind that 'I have heard from the mouth of a good man that a cow is like a cow
 ? chauthaa pramaan he - shabd
 It is written in the sutra that the sentence of Aptopadesh i
e
 Apta Purush is word-proof
 bhashyakaar ne aptpurush kaa lakshan yah batalaaya he ki jo saakshatkritadharma ho, jaisaa dekha suna ho thik thik vaisaa hi kahanevaala ho, vahi aapt he, chaahe vah arya ho yaa mlechh
 Gautama has made two distinctions of Optopradesh - Vishal and Unseen
 pratyaksh jaani hui baton ko bataanevaala drushtaarth or keval anumaan se jaani janevaali baton ko bataanevaala adrushtaarth kehalaata he
 While commenting on this, Vatsyana has said that in this way there is a department of cosmic and sage sentences, that means only Vedavakya can be considered in the proof category in the invocation
 naiyayikon ke mat se veda ishvarkrut he isse uske vaakya sadaa satya or vishwasaneey hai par loukik vaakya tabhi satya maane ja sakate hai
 When their person is said to be authentic
 sutron main veda ke pramanya ke vishay main kai shankaaye uthaakar unka samaadhaan kiya gaya he
 Mimansak does not believe in God, but he also considers Veda to be unorthodox and continual
 nity to mimasak shabd maatr ko maanate hai or shabd or arth kaa nity sambandh batalaate hai
 But the word Naayyakik does not have any continual relationship with the meaning
 vaakya kaa arth kya he, is vishay main bahut matbhed he
 By the opinion of the believers, the meaning or motivation is the sentence - that is, 'do it', 'don't do it', the same thing is said from all the sentences, whether clearly or not, by relation to other sentences with such meaning
 par naiyayikon ke mat se kai padon ke sambandh se nikalanevaala arth hi vaakyarth he
 But the words that occur in a sentence are the root cause of the sentence
 nyaayamanjari main padon main do prakaar kii shakti maani gai he—pratham abhidhatri shakti jisase ek ek pad apane apane arth kaa bodh karaata he or duusari taatpary shakti jisase kai padon ke sambandh kaa arth suchit hota he
 Apart from strength, symptoms have also been considered by the inmates
 alankarikon ne teesri vritti vyanjana bhi maani he par naiyayik use pruthak vritti nahin maanate
 According to the sutra, the number of letters that have inflection at the end are the same and the divisions are of two types - name inflection and famous inflection
 is prakaar naiyayik naam or aakhyaat do hi prakaar ke pad maanate hai
 The commentator has proved the avayya under the name itself
 nyaay main upar likhe chaar hi pramaan maane gaye hai
 Mimansak and Vedanti say four more evidences, namely, economy, possible and lack
 naiyayik in chaaron ko apane chaar pramaanon ke antargat maanate hai
 Knowledge of that meaning without the meaning of sight or the subject of the dictated subject is called 'arthapatti'
 jaise--devdatt din main kuch bhi nahin khaataa, phir bhi khub motaa he'
 In this sentence, 'do not eat however thick,' these two statements do not have the connotation of coordination
 at: upapatti ke liye 'raatri main bhojan karata he' yah kalpana kii jaati he
 From this statement it became clear that 'though he does not eat during the day, but eats at night'
 atev devdatt motaa he
 Here, it is imagined itself to eat subsets in the first sentence
 isi ko 'arthapatti' kehete hai
 It is of two types - 'astrological', as in the example above, and 'euthanasia'
 jaise- sunne main aata he ki devdatt jo jivit he, ghar main nahin hai
 To imagine 'devadatta is in a different place' than it is 'economism'
 anyathaa 'jivit hokar ghar main nahin rahanaa' in donon baton main samanvay nahin ho saktaa
 Prabhakar is of the opinion that by any evidence there can be an 'arthashastra' for the subsistence of a known subject, not just by sight and sound
 yah baat saadhaaran rup se pratyaksh aadi pramaanon se siddh nahin hota, tasmaat 'arthapatti' kaa naam kaa ek bhinn 'pramaan' mimasak maanate hai
 Lack of evidence - When there is no knowledge of an object through direct evidence, then 'it is not an object', thus we have knowledge of the 'lack' of that object
 is 'abhaav' kaa gyaan indriyasannikarsh aadi ke dwaara to ho nahin saktaa, kyonki indriyasannikarsh 'bhav' padaarthon ke saath hota he
 Therefore, an independent proof of 'unavailability', or 'lack', is considered as an epistemology by which one is aware of the 'absence' of something
 yah to mimasakon kaa ek saadhaaran mat he
 But Prabhakar does not accept it
 unka kathan he ki jitne 'pramaan' he, sab ke apane-apane swatantra 'prameya' hai, kintu 'abhaav' pramaan kaa koi bhi apana 'vishay' nahin he
 Like - 'it does not happen on this land', if there had been a decrease in this knowledge, then it would have had the same knowledge as the ground floor, but it is not so
 phir ham dekhte hai 'keval bhoomi', jis kaa gyaan hamen pratyaksh se hota he
 In fact, 'lack' is nothing but its form
 vah to jahaan rahata he, usee aadhaar ke saath kaha jaataa he
 Therefore, in reality, in addition to the knowledge of surface, there is no such 'knowledge'
 atev 'abhaav' adhikaran swaroop hi he
 It does not have a separate existence
 kumaril ne 'sambhav' kii charchaa kii he
 For example, 'half a milk is definitely in one serving of milk'; That is, there can be doubt in being a Ser, but there can be no doubt in being half Ser
 ise hi 'sambhav' kaa naam kaa pramaan 'puranikon' ne mana he
 Kumaril has considered this 'presumption'
 'aitihya' kaa bhi ullekh kumaril ne kiya he
 Like 'ghost is on the tree of this vat'
 yah vruddh log kehete aaye hai
 Hence, this is also an independent proof
 parantu is kathan kii satyata kaa nirnay nahin ho saktaa, atev yah pramaan nahin he
 If there is evidence, then it is under the 'agam'
 kintu in donon ko anya mimasakon kii tarah kumaril ne bhi sweekaar nahin kiya
 'pratibha' means 'pratibhagyan' is not always true, hence even the people do not accept it as evidence
 upar ke vivaran se spasht ho gaya hoga ki pramaan hi nyaayashastra kaa mukhya vishay he
 From this, the words 'certificated', 'authentic', etc
, are treated as naive or logical
 pramaan kaa vishay prameya kehalaata he
 Such subjects are numbered twelve under justice- is suchi se yah na samajhnaa chahie ki in vastuon ke atirikt or prameya ho hi nahin sakate
 Many things are proved by proof
 par gautam ne apane sutron main unheen baton par vichaar kiya he jinke gyaan se apvarg yaa moksh kii prapti ho
 In justice, desire, malice, effort, pleasure, sorrow and knowledge are called the sex of the soul, although the soul is considered separate from body, sense and mind
 vaisheshik main bhi ichha, dwesh sukh, dukh aadi ko aatma kaa ling kaha he
 Gautam has given for separation of soul from body, sense and mind
 vedantiyon ke samaan naiyayik ek hi aatma nahin maanate, anek maanate hai
 The Sankhyas also consider many men, but they consider the man to be a non-believer and an observer, a witness or a witness
 naiyayik aatma ko karta, bhokta aadi maanate hai
 God is the soul that creates the world
 nyaay main aatma ke samaan hi ishwar main bhi sankhya, pariman, pruthaktv, sanyog, vibhaag, ichha, buddhi praytn ye gun maane gaye hai par nity karke
 It is written in Nyayamanjari that except the sorrow, malice and sanskar, all souls have their attributes in God
 bahut se log sharir ko paanchon bhuton se bana maanate hai par nyaay main sharir keval prithvi ke parmaanuon se ghatit mana gaya he
 The body of consciousness, sense and meaning is called body
 jis padaarth se sukh ho uske paane or jisase dukh ho use dur karne kaa vyapaar cheshtaa he
 Therefore, the body of trees also comes under the characteristic of the body
 par vachaspati mishra ne kaha he ki yah lakshan vrikshashareer main nahin ghatata, isse keval manushyasharir kaa hi abhipraay samajhnaa chahie
 Shankar Mishra has said in the Vaiseshika Sutrapaskar that trees have a body, but the efforts and senses are not visible in it, because it cannot be called a body
 purvajanm main kiye karmon ke anusaar sharir utpann hota he
 The five senses are said to have originated from the five ghosts
 ghranendriya se gandh kaa grahan hota he, isse vah prithvi se bani he
 Rasna is made of water because juice is the quality of water
 chakshu tej se bana hai kyoki rup tej kaa hi gun he
 Skin is made of air because touch is a property of air
 shroatra akaash se bana he kyonki shabd akaash kaa gun he
 According to Buddhists, the direct balls of the senses are seen in the body, those are called senses
 ; par naiyayikon ke mat se jo ang dikhaai padate hai ve indriyon ke adhishthan maatr hai, indriyaan nahin hai
 Knowledge of the senses cannot be done by the senses
 kuch log ek hi twag indriya maanate hai
 The objectivity of the senses is established by denying their opinion in justice
 sankhya main paanch karmedriyaan or man lekar gyaarah indriyaan maani gai hai
 Carpentries are not considered in justice, but the mind is considered as a cause and a form
 yadi man sookshm na hokar vyapak hota to yugapad gyaan sambhav hota, arthath anek indriyon kaa ek kshan main ek saath sanyog hone se un sabake vishyon kaa ek saath gyaan hota
 But the newcomers do not believe so
 gandh, ras, rup, sparsh or shabd ye paanchon bhuton ke gun or indriyon ke arth yaa vishad hai
 In justice, intelligence is called another name for knowledge or achievement
 sankhya main buddhi nity kahi gai he par nyaay main anitya
 Like Vaiseshika, justice is also atomistic, that is, the creation of atoms
 pramayon ke sambandh main nyaay or vaisheshik ke mat praayah ek hi hai isse darshan main donon ke mat nyaay mat kahe jate hai
 Vatsyayan has also said in the comment that things which Gautama has not said in the sutras with detail and fear should be accepted from Vaishashika
 upar jo kuch likhaa gaya he usase prakat ho gaya hoga ki gautam kaa nyaay keval vichaar yaa tark ke niyam nirdhaarit karanevaala shaastra nahin he balki pramayon kaa bhi vichaar karanevaala darshan he
 This is the difference from western logic
 laajik, darshan ke antargat nahin liya jaataa par nyaay, darshan he
 It is a must that evidence or logic has been specifically tested in justice
 nyaayashastra tathaa mimasashastra main 'pramanyawad' sab se kathin vishay kaha jaataa he
 In Mithila, it is famous in the scholarly circle that at one time in the 14th century, a very learned scholar and poet came to the meeting of Maharaja of Mithila from another province
 unki kavitvsakti or vidvatta se sabhi chakit hue
 While living in Mithila, he began to study 'pramanism'
 kuch dinon ke pashchaat maharaj ne unase ek din naveen kavita sunaane ke liye kaha, to bahut der sochane ke baad unhone ek kavita kii rachana kii-- He expressed his inability to complete its second line
 vastav main 'pramanyawad' bahut kathin he or iske adhyayan karne waalon kaa dhyaan or kahin nahin ja saktaa he

 In 1921 AD, the British defeated Turkey, and overthrew the Sultan, the same Sultan was also known as the Khalifa / Chief of Muslims, this thing was exorcised by the Muslims of India and other Muslim countries, which led to movements everywhere

 Thus on 28 / 9 / 1925, his father-like guru Dr
 Balakrishna Shivram Munje, his disciples Dr
 Hedgewar, Mr
 Paranjpe and Bapu Sahib Soni laid the foundation of a Hindu youth club, which was later renamed the National self-service Association

 In this, all the people who believe in and practice the views of religions and religions like Sanatani, Aryasamaji, Jain, Buddhist, Sikh etc
 are Hindu The Muslims and Christians did not fall under this definition, so it was decided not to take them in this militia and it was decided to take only Hindus, the main mantra
 Was "prevention of Ambiguity and Military Causes of Hindus"

 Prayers also came to be known as "prayers" started in Sanskrit language instead of Marathi
 For senior volunteers, OTC Camps were started where they were also given paramilitary education
 For all these works, the services of a retired military officer Mr
 Martande Rao Jog were used
 By 1935-36 such branches were limited to Maharashtra only and its volunteers
 The number was only a few thousand, but the enthusiasm of the Sarsanghchalak and volunteers was worth seeing
 Dr
 Hedgewar himself was so excited that in one of his address he said Key: - “sangh ke janmkaal ke samay kii paristhiti badi vicitra si thi, hinduon kaa hindusthan kahana us samay niraa paagalpan samajha jaataa tha or kisi sanghathan ko hindu sanghathan kahana desh droh tak ghoshit kar diya jaataa tha” l In the tragic situation that Dr
 Hedgewar expressed, the effort of the leadership of the newly formed Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha - with the courage among the Hindu youth, resonated with the slogan "hindusthan Hindus - not anyone's father"
 Dr
 Hedgewar said in these words: - “kai sajjan yah kehete hue bhi nahin hichkichaate kii hindusthan keval hinduo kaa hi kaise? yah to un sabhi logon kaa he jo yahan basate hai l khed he kii is prakaar kaa kathan / akshep karne vaale sajjanon ko raashtra shabd kaa arth hi gyaat nahin l keval bhoomi ke kisi tukade ko raashtra nahin kehete l ek vichaar-ek aachaar-ek sabhyataa evam parampara main jo log puraatan kaal se rahete chale aae hai unheen logon kii samskruti se raashtra banataa he l is desh ko hamaare hi kaaran hindusthan naam diya gaya he l duusare log yadi samopchaar se is desh main basna chaahate hai to avashya bas sakate hai l hamane unhen na kabhi manaa kiya he na karenge l kintu jo hamaare ghar atithi ban kar aate hai or hamaare hi gale par churi pherane par utaaru ho jate hai unke liye yahan ratti bhar bhi sthaan nahin milegaa l sangh kii is vichaardhaara ko pehle aap thik thaak samaj lijie l” On another occasion, Dr
 Hedgewar had said, "the Sangh wants only the Hindusthan Hindus - to make this motto true," similar to other countries, "because of the Hindus" - what Hindus in this country would say That will be the former direction
 This is the only thing that the Sangh knows, there is no need for the volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to fall into any other crisis
 " jab vir saavarkar ratnagiri main drushti band the, tab dow headgavar vahaan unase milane gayi
 By then he had also read the book Hindutva by Veer Savarkar
 dow headgavar us pustak ke vichaaron se bahut prabhavit hue or uski saraahna karte hue bole ki “vir saavarkar ek adarsh vyakti he”
 Both believed that Hindus would be divided into casteism, untouchability, urban-migrants and regionalism, till Hindus would not leave blind faith, old orthodox thinking, religious fanatics, and until it would be organized and united, Until then, he will not be able to take his rightful place in the world

 Multiculturalism is the acceptance or promotion of multi-ethnic culture, it applies to the demographic structure of a specific place, usually at organizational levels such as schools, businesses, neighborhoods, cities, or nations
 is sandarbh main, bahusamskritivaadee, kendra ke rup main koi vishesh jaateey, dharmik samooh or / yaa saanskrithik samudaay ko badhaava dene ke bina vishisht jaateey or dharmik samoohon ke liye vistaarit nyaaysammat mulya sthiti kii vakaalat karte hai
 The policy of multiculturalism is often contrasted with assimilation and social integration concepts
 bahusamskritwad ke samarthakon dwaara ise ek behatar pranali ke rup main dekha jaataa he jo ki samaaj ke bheetar logon ko unke astitv ko vaastavik rup se abhivyakt karne kii anumati detii he or jo adhik sahansheel hoti he or saamaajik muddon ke liye behatari ko apanaaya jaataa he

 Andrew Heywood distinguishes between two holistic forms of multiculturalism: indescribable and normative
 "the term 'multiculturalism' is used in various ways, both descriptively and normatively
 As a descriptive term, it is taken to refer to cultural diversity
 

ek maanak shabd ke rup main, bahusamskritwad ek sakaaratmak samarthan he, yahaan tak ki sampradayik vividhta kaa utsav he, jo ki aamtaur par yaa to sammaan or manyata ke liye vibhinn samoohon ke adhikaar ke aadhaar par hota he, yaa naitik or saanskrithik vividhta ke vistrut samaaj ke liye kathith laabh ke aadhaar par hota he
 Criticism of multiculturalism is often said to be whether friendly coexisting cultures that influence each other and still remain isolated are durable, ironic, or desirable
 yah tark diya gaya he ki raashtra rajya, jinka pehle se hi apni ek vishisht saanskrithik pahchaan ke saath paryaay hoti he, bahusamskritwad lagu karne se samaapt ho jaati he jo ki antat mezbaan deshon kii vishisht samskruti kaa apaksharan ho jaataa he
 Susan Moller Okin wrote her essay "is Multiculturalism Bad for Women?" i have written about this question
 
 Harvard political science professor Robert D
 Putnam conducted a nearly decade-long study of how multiculturalism affects social belief
 unhone 40 america samudaay main 26,200 logon kaa surveykshan kiya, jab varg, aay or anya karkon ke liye, jaise adhik nasleey vividhta vaale samudaay, adhik se adhik vishwaas kaa nuksaan, data ko samyojit kiya gaya
 Putnam writes, "people from diverse communities" do not trust the local mayor, they do not trust the local newspaper, they do not trust other people and do not trust the institutions either

 The average cost in economics is unit cost and / or total cost divided by the number of items produced

 Marginal costs are sometimes shown on these articles, where marginal cost refers to the price that is the last item created
 seemaant laagat kul laagat yaa char laagat kaa pehla yupan he
 a common average cost is in the size of the equation because fixed costs always appear before production and marginal cost increases because marginal productivity is low
 aisi that m ek nan tar ke upaadan m seemaant laagat ausat laagat ke neeche hoti he isale maa m vridh ke kaaran ausat laagat kam hoti he
 An increasing marginal cost cuts the U-shaped average cost at its minimum, followed by the slope of the average cost and upward
 upaadan k maa m or vridh karne se seemaant laagat ausat laagat ke upar ho jaataa he isale ausat laagat upaadan k maa badhane ke saath badhati he
 An example of this specific case would be a design to produce a specific amount of wagons over a period of time: below a stated production level, the average cost is higher because of under-used equipment, while above that level, There is an increase in the average cost of production constraints
 lambii avadh ek samay seemaa he jasm fam sabhi aadan k maa, yahaan tak k bhautak puunji bhi bhan ho sakati he
 The reduction of the average cost over a longer period can be upward sloping or downward sloping at the expected lower level of production and upward sloping at the expected higher level of output, leading to the long run average with the middle level of the yield The slope of cost should be zero

 If the firm is a cointegrator in all input markets, and thus how many inputs are lacking by how much the input of the firm is worth, then it can be shown that at a particular level of production, the firm scale has implications
 And if only the mass rate increases, similarly, it has complexities if and if it decreases as the scale increases, and it has neither the economies nor the scale meanings
 In this case, long-term market equilibrium with output competition in the output market will include all companies operating at the minimum point of all long-term average cost curves

 Conversely, if the firm is able to obtain the bulk count of an input, it may have scale economies at some level of production, even if the output decline in that output range has declined

 When the average cost is increasing, the marginal cost is higher than the average cost, when the average cost does not increase nor fall, the marginal cost is equal to the average cost

 The soldiers of the queen climbed the Ghaghri and took control over it and entrusted the responsibility to Umrao Singh for the protection of the talukedar Dhan Singh
 ramgarh ke kuch sipaahi evam mukaas ke jameendaar bhi narayanganj pahunchakar jabalpur-mandla maarg ko band kar diya
 Thus the whole district and the state of Ramgarh had revolted and Waddington was unable to crush the rebels
 vah vidrohiyon kii gatividhiyon se bhaybheet ho chukaa tha
 Except Mandla Nagar, the entire district had become independent
 avanti bai ne mandla vijay ke liye sipaahiyon sahit prasthaan kiya
 On receipt of Rani's information, zamindars of Shahpura and Mukas also left for Mandla
 mandla pahunchane ke purv khaddevara ke sipaahi bhi rani ke sipaahiyon se mil gaye
 Khanty had a battle of Avanti Bai with the British soldiers
 wadington puri shakti lagane ke baad bhi kuch na kar sakaa or mandla chhod siwani kii ore bhaag gaya
 In this way, the entire Mandla district and Ramgarh state became independent
 is vijay ke uparaant aandolankariyon kii shakti main kami aa gai, kintu ullas main kami nahin aayi
 Rani Ramgarh returned
 wadington ne phir se ramgarh ke liye prasthaan kiya
 The queen got information about this
 ramgarh ke kuch sipaahi ghughari ke pahari kshetra main pahunchakar angreji sena kii pratiksha karne lage
 Under the leadership of Lieutenant Werton, the forces of Nagpur were marching towards Ramgarh after conquering the Bichhiya, it was known to Waddington, so Waddington advanced towards Ghighri
 15 janvari 1858 ko ghughari par angrejon kaa niyantran ho gaya
 Ramgarh surrounded the second week of March 1858
 vidrohiyon evam angreji sena main sangharsh chalata rahaa
 The number of rebel soldiers was steadily decreasing

 In flowering plants, pollen sperm are produced inside the pollen
 Dynamic sperm cells shaiwal kii motile shukranu koshikaon or bijrahit paudhon
 Dynamic sperm cells move normally through the flagella and require a water medium in order to swim towards the egg for fertilization
 Much of the energy for motility of sperm in animals is derived from fructose metabolism made in seminal fluid
 yah shukranu midpiece main sthit mitochondria main jagah letaa he
 These cells cannot swim backward due to the nature of their propulsion

 Fungal spermatia may be confused with conidia
 Conidia spores ki nishechan kii swatantra rup se ugna, jabaki spermatia gametes ki nishechan ke liye aavashyak hai
 Some fungi, such as Neurospora crassa, resemble spermatia microconidia as they may perform both functions of fertilization as well as giving rise to new organisms without fertilization
 shukranu nabhik In many land plants, including most gymnosperms and all angiosperms, the male gametophytes primary mode of propagation, for example through wind or insect pollination, bridges the gap between man and woman to destroy the need for water
 Each pollen is comprised of a spermatogenic cell
 ek baar ek grahanshil phool ke kalank par paraag bhoomi, yah ankurit or capel ke madhyam se ek paraag tub se bad shuru hota he
 Before the tube reaches the ovule, the nucleus of the generative cell divides into pollen grains and gives rise to two sperm nuclei which then discharge through the tube into the ovule for fertilization
 In some protists, fertilization also involves nuclei instead of sperm cells, a fertilization tube
 The migration through the egg cell is involved
