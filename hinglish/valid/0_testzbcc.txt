 software ejineering main data modelling takneekon kaa prayog karke aupchaarik data model vivaranon ko lagu karte hue ek data model kaa nirmaan karne kii prakriya data modelling kehalaati he
 Data modeling is a method used to define and analyze the data requirements necessary to support an organization's business processes
 data aavashyaktaaon ko ek vaicharik data model se judi data paribhaashaon ke rup main record kiya jaataa he
 The actual implementation of a conceptual model is called a logical data model
 ek vaicharik data model ke kriyanvayan ke liye anek taarkik data modelon kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 Data modeling defines not only the elements of the data, but also their structures and the relationships between them
 data modelling takneekon or kaarividhiyon kaa prayog ek maanak, sthir, aakalneey rup main data ko chitrit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, taaki ek sansaadhan ke rup main iskaa prabandhan kiya ja sake
 un sabhi pariyojnaon ke liye data modelling maanakon ke prayog kii dridhtaapurvak anushansa kii gai he, jinamein kisi sanghathan ke aantarik data ko paribhaashit evam vishleshit karne ke liye ek maanak saadhan kii aavashyaktaa ho, udaa
 data modelling kaa prayog nimnlikhit kaaryon ke liye kiya ja saktaa he: Data modeling can be done in different types of projects and in many phases of projects
 data model pragatisheel hote hai; kisi bhi vyapaar yaa anuprayog ke liye koi bhi data model kabhi antim nahin hota
 isaki bajaay ek data model ko ek jivit dastavej mana janaa chaiye, jo badalte hue vyapaar kii pratikriya ke rup main badalegaa
 adarsh rup se, data model ko ek ripozitary main rakhaa janaa chaiye, taaki samay ke saath ise punah praapt kiya ja sake, vistaarit kiya ja sake or sampadit kiya ja sake
 whiton ne data modelling ke do prakaar nirdhaarit kiye: Data modeling is also a technique for describing business requirements for a database
 kabhi-kabhi ise database modelling kaha jaataa he kyonki ek data model ko antat ek database main kriyanvit kiya jaataa he
 Data models support data and computer systems by providing definition and formatting of data
 yadi pranaaliyon ke bich aisa lagaataar kiya jaye, to data kii sangatta praapt kii ja sakati he
 If the same data structures are used for storing and accessing data, different applications can share the data
 iske parinaam upar suchit kiye gayi hai
 However, the cost of building, running, and maintaining systems and interfaces is often much higher than it should be
 ve vyapaar kaa samarthan karne kii bajaay usamen baadha bhi utpann kar sakate hai
 One of the main reasons is that the data models implemented in systems and interfaces have low quality
 in samasyaon kaa kaaran ek aise maanak kaa abhaav he, jo yah sunishchit karegaa ki data model vyapaarik aavashyaktaaon kii purti bhi karenge or sangat bhi honge
 According to ANSI in 1975, an illustration of a data model can be of any one of three types: ANSI ke anusaar is vidhi kaa mahatv yah he ki yah teen drushtikonon ko ek duusare se saapeksh rup se swatantra rahane kii anumati detii he
 Storage technology can be changed without affecting logical or conceptual models
 talika / stambh sanrachana vaicharik model ko prabhavit kiye bina badal sakati he
 Naturally, in each case, the structures must remain compatible with other models
 The table / column structure may differ from direct translation of entity classes and attributes, but ultimately it must essentially serve the purposes of the conceptual entity class structure
 The initial stages of many software development projects emphasize the creation of a conceptual data model
 is prakaar ke ek dizine ko ek taarkik data model main varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 In later stages, this model can be transformed into a physical data model
 haalanki ek vaicharik data model ko sidhe hi lagu kar paanaa bhi sambhav he
 In the context of business process integration, see figure, data modeling will result in integration of database
 It complements business process modeling, which results in an application program that supports this business process
 vaastavik database dizine, database ke ek vistrut data model kaa nirmaan karne kii prakriya he
 This logical data model contains all of the logical and physical design selection and physical storage criteria required to construct the design into a data definition language, which can then be used to build a database
 sabhi visheshtaon se yukt ek data model main prayek ikai ke liye vistrut visheshtaayen hoti hai
 Database design terminology can be used to describe various parts of the design of a gross database system
 mukhyatah or sarvaadhik sahi rup main, ise data ke bhandaran ke liye prayukt mul data sanrachanaon kii ek taarkik rachana ke rup main samajha ja saktaa he
 a relational model consists of these tables and views
 ek object database main ikaiyaan or sambandh sidhe object claces or namit sambandhon se jude hote hai
 However, database design terminology can also be used to implement the aggregate process of designing, not only basic data structures, but also forms and queries used as part of a database management system or a gross database application in DBMS
 is
 is prakriya main system interphes par vartmaan system ke vikaas or samarthan laagat kaa 25% se 70% tak kharch aata he
 The main reason for this cost is that these systems do not use a common data model
 If data models are developed on a system-by-system basis, the same analysis is repeated not only in the covered regions, but it is also necessary to do further analysis to build interfaces between them
 adhikansh pranaaliyon main samaan buniyadi ghatak hote hai, jo kisi vishisht uddeshy ke liye punah viksit kiye jate hai
 For example, the same basic classification model as the following can be used as a component: unheen ghatakon ko punah viksit kiya jaataa he kyonki hamaare paas yah bataane kaa koi tarika nahin he ki ve samaan hai
 Data models represent information areas of interest
 haalanki, data modelon ke nirmaan kii anek vidhiyaan hai, lekin len silverstone ke anusaar inamen se keval do vidhiyaan hi shreshth hai, top-down or bottm-ap: Sometimes models are constructed as a mixture of these two methods: considering the structure and data requirements and structure of an application and giving a consistent reference to a subject-area model
 Unfortunately, in many environments, the difference between a logical data model and a physical data model is unclear
 iske atirikt, kuch CASE upkaran taarkik or bhautik data modelon ke bich antar nahin karte
 There are several signaling methods of data modeling
 vaastavik model ko aksar "ikai sambandh model " kaha jaataa he kyonki yah data ko isamen varnit ikaayiyon or unke sambandhon ke sandarbh main chitrit karata he
 An entity-relationship model is a brief conceptual display of structured data
 ikai-sambandh modelling ek sambandhaatmak skima database modelling vidhi he, jiskaa prayog software ejineering main kisi system, saamanytah ek sambandhaatmak database, ke ek prakaar ke vaicharik data model kaa nirmaan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he or isaki aavashyaktaaen ek top-down rup main hoti hai
 These models are used during the first phase of the creation of information systems to describe information requirements or the type of information that is to be placed in a database during requirements analysis
 data modelling takanic kaa prayog kisi vishisht samvaad-vishwa, arthath ruchi ke kshetra ke liye kisi bhi tathviki kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Several techniques have been developed to construct data models
 haalanki ye kaary-paddatiyaan data modelaron ko unke kaary main maargdarshan karatin hai, lekin samaan kaary-paddati kaa prayog karanevaale do bhinn log aksar do bhinn parinaamon ke saath saamne aaenge
 sarvaadhik ullekhneey hai: Common data models are generalizations of traditional data models
 ve manakikrut saamaanya sambandh prakaaron ko or saath hi vastuon ke un prakaaron ko paribhaashit karte hai, jo aise sambandh-prakaaron se judi ho sakati hai
 The definition of a general data model is very similar to the definition of a natural language
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek saamaanya data model sambandhit vastuon ke prakaaron se nirpeksh rahete hue sambandhon ke prakaaron ko ek 'vargeekaran sambandh', jo ki kisi ekal vastu or vastuon ke ek prakaar ke bich ek dwiadhari sambandh hota he or ek 'ansh-purna sambandh', jo ki do vastuon ke bich ek dwiadhari sambandh hota he, jinamein se ek vastu ansh kii bhoomika main or duusari purna kii bhoomika main hoti he, ke rup main paribhaashit kar saktaa he
 a canonical list of categories allows classification of a single object and specifying part-whole relationships for a single object
 sambandhon ke prakaaron kii ek vitanya suchi ke maanakeekaran ke dwaara, ek saamaanya data model tathyon ke prakaaron kii aseemit sankhya ko vyakt kar paane kii kshamta pradaan karata he or yah prakritik bhashaaon kii kshamtaaon kaa prayog karegaa
 duusari ore, paaramparik data modelon kaa domen dayera nishchit or simit hota he kyonki aise modelon kii sthapana keval us prakaar ke tathyon kii vyakhya karne kii anumati detii he, jo model main purv-paribhaashit hon
 The logical data structure of a DBMS, whether it is hierarchical, networked, or relational, cannot fully meet the needs of a conceptual definition of data because it is limited in scope and it is part of the implementation strategy used by that DBMS
 Is bent
 atah ek vaicharik drushtikon se data ko paribhaashit karne kii aavashyaktaa ke parinamswaroop arth-vigyaan data modelling takneekon ke vikaas hua he
 Namely, techniques for defining the meaning of data in terms of mutual relations with other data
 As shown in the figure, real-world is defined as physical data stores in the form of signals in terms of resources, ideas, events, etc
 ek arth-vigyaan data model ek sankshepan he, jo paribhaashit karata he ki ye chinh vaastavik-vishwa se kis prakaar jude hue hai
 Thus, this model must be a true real-world demonstration
 ek arth-vigyaan data model kaa prayog anek uddeshyon ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, jaise: The overall goal of the semantic data model is to capture more data by integrating relational concepts with powerful summarization concepts known from the field of artificial intelligence

 dik-kaal yaa spes-time kii sankalpana, albert oinstin dwaara unke saapekshata ke siddhant main di gai thi| unke anusaar teen dishaao kii tarah, samay bhi ek aayam he or bhautikee main inhen ek saath chaar ayaamon ke rup main dekhnaa chahie
 He said that in reality all the things of the universe live in this four-dimensional period
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki kabhi-kabhi aisi paristhitiyaan ban jaati hai jab bhinn vastuon ko in sabhi-ayaamon kaa anubhav alag-alag prathit ho
 The relation of time and time comes so much in our daily behavior that it is natural to have some incomplete but strong beliefs about them since childhood
 kaviyon ne dik or kaal kii gambhir, vishaal tathaa sundar kalpanaaon kaa varnan kiya he
 In philosophy and western psychology, there has been a thought about them since ancient times
 kanad ke vaisheshik darshan main akaash, dik or kaal kii dharanaayen suspasht di gai hai or inke gunon kaa bhi varnan kiya gaya he
 There is definitely a relation between time and time in the knowledge gained from sensory experiences
 is gyaan kii yadi vaastaviktaa samajha jaae to dik or kaal vastaviktaa se alag nahin ho sakate
 Each philosophical sect has given its own conceptions of reality, problem and time, their interrelations, which do not have consensus
 ganit main bhi dik or kaal kaa apratyaksh reeti se sambandh aata he
 Therefore, the development of prestigious physics depended on these assumptions
 bhautikee ke kuch praayogic fal jab in dharanaon se visangat dikhaai dene lage, tab ye dharanaayen vichlit hone lageen evam aapekshitawaad ne dik or kaal kaa nayaa swaroop sthapit kiya, jo anek prayogon dwaara pramanit or falat: ab sarvasammat ho chukaa he
 This new form of problem and time is not only different but also very difficult to understand, because the use of specific mathematics is necessary in its rendering
 at: jahaan-jahaan dik tathaa kaal sambandh aata he uskaa spashtikaran pehle sthool drushti se, tatpashchaat sookshm drushti se or ant main bhautikee kii drushti se karnaa adhik saral hoga
 Different types of problems can be considered by the suffixes of problem properties from sensory experiences
 anubhavon ke buddhi par jo parinaam hote hai unka pruthakkaran karke dharanaayen banati hai
 In this way, the perception of problems caused by self-experience is called "self-problem" or "personal problem"
 indriyajanya anubhavon main anek anubhav samast vyaktiyon ke liye samaan hote hai or aise anubhav jis ghatana se milte hai, use "vastav' kaha jaataa he
 The perception of "reality" is formed from communities of real events
 indriyon se drushti, sparsh, dhwani, ras or gandh ke anubhav milte hai, kintu ye anubhav sarvada vishwaas ke yogya hote hai, aisa nahin he
 Optical illusions are well known
 sparsh ke bhi sambhram vyavhaar main nity prathit hote hai, jaise do daanton ke bich kii khoh jeebh ko jitani lagati he usase kam choti ungali ko lagati he
 Often this is the case with all kinds of sensory experiences
 at: in apurna anubhavon se vyaktigat dik kii jo dharna banati he vah bhramamoolak hi hoti he
 With the help of measuring instruments and other appropriate instruments, limited subsistence of the senses can be increased and thus many events can be confused
 prayogon main maapan karke dik kii jo dharna hoti he use "bhautik dik kaha jaataa he
 Measurement scales are used for measurement
 anubhavon main dik kaa sambandh chaar prakaar se aata he or in chaaron prakaaron par vichaar karke dik ke gunon kii vyaavhaarik kalpanaayen banati hai
 When the object is directed to the site of an object, a form of the problem is conceived and it is also believed that the existence of the problem is independent
 kisi vastu ke sthal kaa nirdesh anya vastu ke "saapeksh' karne par dik kii "saapeksh sthiti' main doosraa swaroop dikhi detaa he
 The third form of a problem resembles the "shape" of objects, from which the divisibility of the problem can also be imagined
 akaash kii ore dekhne se dik kii "vishalata' kaa chauthaa swaroop dikhaai detaa he
 It is from these four types of forms that practical assumptions are often made regarding problems and the qualities of problems are also informed
 ghatnaon se praapt indriyajanya anubhavon kaa vichar kiya jaae to unke do prakaar hote hai
 Difference of events leads to imagery of problems and their sequence of imagery leads to time
 is prakaar dik or kaal hamaari vichaardhaara main sandigdh rup se pravesh karte hai
 The same period as the problem is also personal and each person's census is free and arbitrary
 itnaa hi nahin, is swa-kaal kii gananaa main bhi parivartan hota he or vah vyakti ke swasthya, avasthaa ityadi sthitiyon par nirbhar karata he, jaise, kisi kaary main manushya magn ho to kaal teji se katataa he
 Therefore, personal or self-time is not trustworthy
 kisi prakritik ghatana se - din or raat se - jo kaal kaa maapan hoga vah vyaktigat nahin rahegaa or sab logon ke liye samaan hoga
 Hence, such a period is called public period
 din or raat kaal ke sthool vibhaag hai
 If their small portions are done, then they are more suitable for time-lapse in practice
 isliye prahar, ghatika, pal vipal athwa ghanta, minute, second ityadi vibhaag kiye gaye
 Generally, time is measured by clock
 dik kii bhanti kaal ke bhi chaar swaroop vyavhaar main dikhaai dete hai
 "when?" From an event or experience
 The question is present and is equated with the problematic "where"
 is kalpana se kaal kaa astitv swatantra samajha jaataa he
 The relative form of time is seen when describing another event relative to the time period
 do ghatnaon ke bich ke kaal se kaal kaa jo swaroop dikhaai detaa he vah dik ke aakaar se samaan he
 Similarly, with the adjectives of timeless, infinite etc
, the vastness of time is shown
 dik tathaa kaal ke chaaron swaroopon ko, yaa gunon ko kahie, milakar vichaar karne par inke vishay main hamaari jo dharanaayen banati hai unako "swa' yaa "vyaktigat' athwa "manovaigyanik' dik or kaal kaha jaataa he
 To give definitions to the concepts of problems and times, a means of measuring them is necessary
 dik ke maapan ke liye drudh padaarthon ke dand, aujaar tathaa yantra upyog main laae jate hai
 These instruments measure the properties of objects such as length, angle, area, volume, etc
 in maapnon ke samay bindu, rekha, samtal ityadi kii dharanaayen banati jaati hai
 When these assumptions are strengthened by many iterations, then the location of the point, line, plane, etc
 is fundamental and the material objects are removed from these assumptions
 ab in dharanaon kii or eucalidia jyamiti kii moulik dharanaon kii samanta spasht hogi
 The notion of a problem involving measurement of fixed objects, or the measurement of objects, is called geometric or euclideal problem
 yah spasht he ki dik kii is dharna se uske jo gun samajhe jate hai ve keval eucalidia jyamiti kii paribhaashaon, swayansiddh or kalpanaaon ke upar hi nirbhar hote hai
 Our practical perception of problems and this geometric notion, determined by measurement, are the form of our macro vision and micro vision respectively
 eucalidia jyamiti par nirdhaarit dik kii yah dharna yadhyapi swaabhaavik dikhaai detii hogi, tathaapi iskaa vishleshan karne kii aavashyata he
 In Euclidean geometry some definitions and some axiomatic facts are given and they have been developed logically
 ye dharanaayen keval kaalpanik or swatantra hai
 With a little consideration it will be clear that Euclidean geometry has no real relation to objects of behavior
 apni mul kalpanaaon ko viksit karte samay unka paraspar tarksangat sambandh rakhana or ek "kaalpanik' ganit shaastra kaa nirmaan karnaa, itnaa hi is jyamiti kaa mul uddeshy tha
 This geometry was extremely successful in this purpose
 is jyamiti kaa or bhi vistaar karke use "vyaavhaarik' banane ke liye "adarsh drudh vastu' kii paribhaasha yah he ki iske do binduon kaa antar kisi bhi paristhiti main utana hi rahata he
 The use of measuring pen or other tools depends on this feature
 vastut: is prakaar "adarsh drudh vastu' ko samavisht karne par eucalidia jyamiti kaa swaroop badal jaataa he or usko ab ham bhautikee kaa ek vibhaag samaj sakate hai
 But in practice this change of Euclidean geometry is not seen from this point of view
 maapan karne par vyaavhaarik vastuon ke maapan ke liye eucalidia jyamiti ke siddhant yatharth dikhaai dete hai
 So Euclidean geometry came to be considered "real"
 vyaavhaarik anubhav or eucalidia jyamiti kaa drushti se newton ne apni dik or kaal kii dharanaayen nishchit rup se prastut kii or pratishthit bhautikee kaa vikaas praaia: vartmaan shatabdi ke prarambh tak inhen dharanaon par nirbhar rahaa
 Newton considered the problem to be independent power and also gave it its merits
 newton ke anusaar dik ke gun sarv dishaao main tathaa sarv binduon par samaan hi hote hai, arthath dik samadik, samang tathaa ek samaan he
 Therefore, the properties of substances are the same at all places in the problem
 dik anant he or newton ke dik main lambaai, kaal tathaa gati se abaadhit rahati he
 Newton has given his belief about the period, and this notion was also according to the development of physics of that time
 newton ke anusaar kaal bhi ek swatantra satta he
 The special quality of Kaal is that it "flows" continuously and everywhere at the same speed and no situation has any consequence on it
 kaal bhi anant he
 In summary, according to Newton both pain and time are independent and absolute entities
 newton aadi kii yantriki inhen dharanaon par nirbhar thi
 In mechanics, both speed and acceleration, both of these had to be fixed in time and time, and at that time there were no errors in these assumptions
 vaise hi bhautikee main newton kaa itnaa prabhaav tha ki in dharanaon par shankaa pradarshit karnaa sambhav nahin tha
 Mathematicians such as Bolaiye, Lobatchevsky, Reiman, etc
, proved that euclidean geometries can be formed if some transformations of Euclidean geometry are appropriate
 yadhyapi aeuclidia jyamitiyon ke anek siddhant eucalidia jyamiti ke siddhanton se bhinn hote hai, tathaapi ve ayogy nahin hote hai
 In particular Reiman's Euclidean Geometry made it clear that Euclidean Geometry is not the only fundamental one
 yadhyapi aeuclidia jyamitiyaan kalpana karne main kathin hoti hai, tathaapi tarksmmat hone se unke fal atyant rochak tathaa upyukt hote hai
 The imagery of the curvature of the problem was particularly suitable for the imagery of problems of more than three anomalies

 Template: Akon nen: econ Kavita Krishnamurthy is an important playback singer of Indian cinema
 kavita jab aath saal kii thim to unhone ek gayan pratiyogita main pratham puraskaar jeeta
 Since then, she had grown up dreaming of becoming a famous singer
 2005 ko unhen padmashri se puraskrit kiya gaya
 Kavita, a popular playback singer of Hindi cinema, was born in 1958 in New Delhi
 sangeet kii praarambhik shiksha unhen ghar main hi mili
 He later learned classical music from Balaram Puri
 nau saal kii umr main kavita ko swar samraji lata mangeshkar ke saath bangla bhashaa main ek geet gane kaa mauka mila
 It was from here that he decided to enter the field of playback singing
 mumbai ke saint jevier college main snaatak karne ke dauraan kavita har pratiyogita main bad-chadhakar hissaa leti thim
 This was the time when famous singer Manna Dey heard her song at an event and gave her a chance to sing in commercials
 saal 1980 main kavita ne apana pehla parshv geet kaahe ko byaahi maang baro sajnaa gaaya
 However, the song was later dropped from the film
 saal 1985 main film pyaar jhukta nahin ke gaanon ne unhen parshv gayika ke rup main pahchaan dilaai
 After this, the songs Mr
 Hawa Hawai and Karte Hum Pyaar from the film Mr
 India earned him the status of superhit singer
 90 ke dashak main kavita krishnamurthi hindi cinema kii agrani parshv gayika banakar ubharin
 His songs sung in the film 1942: a Love Story are still liked today
 unhone apane kariyar main anand-milind, udit narayan, e
aar
 rahamaan, anu malik jaise gayakon va sangeet nirdeshkon ke saath kaam kiya he
 Kavita once told in an interview that she loved actor Dilip Kumar as a child
 vah jab badi ho rahi thim, tab abhinaytaon main sanjeev kumaar ko pasand karti thim
 He also likes Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir Khan
 abhinetriyon main shridevi, rani mukherjee, kaajol or priti jinta pasand hai
 She considers Shabana Azmi the best actress

 Evolution is the change of genetic traits of a biological population with generations
 jaivik aabaadiyon main genetic parivartan ke kaaran avlokan yogya lakshanon main parivartan hota he
 As genetic diversity varies with generations, natural selection makes those traits more common that provide greater success in survival and reproduction
 prithvi kii umr lagbhag 4
54 arab varsh he
 The oldest undisputed evidence of life is 3
5 billion years old
 ye saboot pashchimi australia main 3
5 varsh puraane balua pathar main mili microbial chataayee ke jeevashm hai
 Older, but conflicting evidence of this life is: 1) 3
7 billion years old graphite found in Greenland, a biogenic substance, and 2) "remains of biotic life" found in 4
1 billion year old stones in Western Australia in 2015
 kram-vikaas jivan kii utpatti ko samajhane kii koshish nahin karata he 
 But evolution explains how today's complex life has evolved from ancient simple life
 aaj kii sabhi jatiyon ke bich samanta dekh kar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki prithvi ke sabhi jeevon kaa ek saajha purvaj he
 This is called the last public ancestor
 aaj kii sabhi jatiyaan kram-vikaas kii prakriya ke dwaara is se utpann hui hai
 All individuals have a genetic material in the form of genes
 sabhi shaks ise apane mata-pita se grahan karte hai or apni santan ko dete hai
 The genes of the offspring vary slightly
 iskaa kaaran utparivartan or langik janan ke dauraan maujuuda jeens main pherbadal he
 Due to this, children are slightly different from parents and each other
 agar wo bhinnataayen upyogi hoti hai to santan ke jivit rahane or prajnan karne kii sambhaavna zyada hoti he
 Because of this, the chances of surviving and breeding different individuals of the next generation are not equal
 falswaroop jo lakshan jeevon ko apni paristhitiyon ke zyada anukulit banaate hai, agali pidiyon main wo zyada saamaanya ho jate hai
 These differences keep increasing gradually
 aaj dekhi jane vaali jeev vividhta ke liye yahi prakriya jimmedaar he
 Most genetic mutations provide no support to individuals, do not alter their appearance nor harm them
 genetic drift ke madhyam se ye nishpaksh genetic utparivartan keval sanyog se aabaadiyon main sthapit ho jate hai or bahut pidiyon tak jivit rahete hai
 In contrast, natural selection is not a random process because it protects the traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction
 prakritik varan or genetic drift jivan ke nity or gatisheel ang hai
 These processes have formed branches of the family tree of life over billions of years
 kram-vikaas kii aadhunik soch 1859 main prakashit charles darwin kii kitaab jeevajatiyon kaa udbhav se shuru hui
 In addition, studies by Gregor Mendel on plants helped to understand genetics
 jeevashmon kii khoj, jansankhya anuvanshiki main pragati or vaigyanik anusandhan ke vaishvik natwork ne kram-vikaas kii kriyavidhi kii or adhik vistrut jaankaree pradaan kii he
 Scientists now have a greater understanding of the origin of new castes and they have now observed the process of speciation in laboratory and nature
 kram-vikaas vah mul vaigyanik siddhant he jise jeevvaigyanik jivan ko samajhane ke liye prayog karte hai
 It is used in many disciplines such as medicine, psychology, bio-conservation, anthropology, forensic science, agriculture and other socio-cultural subjects
 kram-vikaas ke mukhya vichaar sankshep main nimnlikhit hai: Museums of natural history were very popular in the 19th century
 is dauraan europea khojayatraayen or nausena ke abhiyaan bade sangrahalayon ke prakritik vaigyanikon or sangrahadhyakshon ko saath le jate the
 Charles Darwin was a graduate educated and trained in the subject of natural history science
 unke jaise prakritik itihaaskaar sangrahalayon ke liye namoonon ko ikattha karte the, unki soochi banaate the, unka varnan or adhyayan karte the
 Darwin was working as a natural scientist on a ship called HMS Beagle
 unhen duniya bhar kii paanch varsh kii anusandhan yatra kaa kaam saunpa gaya tha
 During his travels he collected samples of many organisms and inspected them
 unhen dakshini america ke taton or nazadiiki gailapagos dweepasmooh ke vividh jeevon main khaas dilchaspee thi
 Darwin gained extensive experience collecting and studying specimens from far off places
 apane in adhyayanon se unhone yah vichaar pesh kiya ki har jati apane jaise lakshanon vaale purvajon se viksit hui he
 In 1938 he explained how this could be a natural process
 unhone is prakritik prakriya ko prakritik varan kaa naam diya
 The size of a population depends on the amount of resources present in its environment
 varshon tak aabaadi kaa aakaar sthir bana rahane ke liye aabaadi ke aakaar or uplabdh sansadhano main santulan bana rahanaa jaruri he
 More offspring are born than the environment the offspring can shelter
 iske kaaran kisi bhi peedi ke sabhi shaks jivit nahin rah sakate hai
 Therefore, there is always a competitive struggle for the resources necessary for survival
 is se darwin ko ehsaas hua kii uttarjivan keval sanyog par nirbhar nahin karata he
 He realized that survival depends on the individual's differences, or "traits"
 kuch lakshan shakson kii uttarjivita main sahaayta karte hai or kuch usamen baadha daalate hai
 The more customized personas of the environment give more children to the next generation than their less adapted rivals
 jo lakshan uttarjivan or prajnan main baadha daalate hai wo kuch pidiyon ke baad lupt ho jate hai
 The traits that help in survival and reproduction accumulate from generation to generation
 is prakaar shakson kii uttarjivan or prajnan kii asmaan kshamta ke kaaran dhire-dhire aabaadiyon main parivartan ho jaataa he
 Observations of differences in animals and plants became the basis of the theory of natural selection
 darwin ne dekha ki orchidon or kiton main ek khaas saajhedaari hoti he jo padpon ke paragan main madad karti he
 He observed that orchids have many structures that attract insects, so that the pollen of the flowers sticks to their bodies
 is prakaar se kit ek nar orchid se ek maadaa orchid tak paraag dhote hai
 Despite the intricate appearance of the orchids, these specialized parts are made from the same basic structures that other flowers form
 apni pustak orchidon kaa nishechan main darwin prastaavit karte hai ki orchid pushp pehle se maujuud pushp bhaagon se prakritik varan kii prakriya ke dwaara parivesh ke zyada anukulit bane hai
 Darwin was still researching and experimenting with his ideas that he received a letter from Alfred Russell Wallace
 is chitthee main vailes ne darwin ke siddhant ke jaise ek siddhant kaa varnan kiya tha
 Due to this both of them jointly published these principles
 vailes or darwin donon jivan ke itihaas ko ek vansh vriksh kii tarah dekhte the, jisamen shakhaon kii nok aaj kii jatiyon ko darshaati he or shakhaon ke vibhajit hone kii jagah ek saajhe purvaj ko
 Darwin said that living things are relatives
 iskaa matlab tha ki sara jivan thode se saral purvajon se utpann hua he
 And it was also likely that all organisms had the same ancestor
 darwin ne prakritik varan dwaara kram-vikaas ke apane siddhant ko 1859 main apni pustak jeevajatiyon kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 His theory means that all organisms, including humans, are the byproduct of continuous natural processes
 iske kaaran kuch dharmik guton ne kram-vikaas ke siddhant par aapatti uthaai he
 In contrast, more than 99 percent of the people in the scientific community support this theory
 aksar prakritik varan ko swasthitam kii uttarjivita kaa paryaay samajha jaataa he, par ye abhivyakti 1864 main prakashit harbart spencer kii pustak jeevigyaan ke siddhant se janmi he, jo darwin kii kitaab ke paanch varsh baad prakashit hui thi
 Survival of the fittest misunderstands the process of natural selection because natural selection is not just about survival and not always the healthiest
 darwin ke prakritik varan ke siddhant ne kram-vikaas ke aadhunik siddhant kii neenv rakhi
 Their research and observations have shown that individuals in a population differ from each other, some of these differences are from parents, and natural selection chooses and discards these differences
 par ve in bhinnataaon kaa kaaran nahin bataa sake
 Like biologists before them they continued to understand that genetic traits were the cause of use or non-use, and that the traits that were ingested over their lifetimes could be passed on to their children
 unhone iske udhaaharan khojane kii koshish kii
 They thought that the legs of large flightless birds like the ostrich would have been overly powerful from generation to generation, and their wings would have been weakened from generation to generation due to less flying
 is galatarahami ko "adhigrahit lakshanon kii anuvaanshikta" kaha jaataa tha jo ki jin baptist lamark dwaara 1809 main prastaavit siddhant "jatiyon kaa parivartan" kaa bhaag thi
 At the end of the 19th century this theory was called Lamarckism
 darwin ne jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshanon kii anuvaanshikta samajhane ke liye pangenesis naam kaa ek asafal siddhant prastaavit kiya
 The experiments of August Weissmann in the 1880s showed that the symptoms acquired during their lifetimes could not be passed on to children
 iske kaaran kuch samay main lamarkwaad ko tyaag diya gaya
 How new traits are given to parents by offspring is answered by Gregor Mendel's pioneering work on genetics
 matar ke paudhon kii kai pidiyon par kiye gaye unke prayogon ne sabit kiya ki mata or pita main sex koshikaon ke gathan ke samay anuvaanshik jaankaree vibhajit ho jaati he or nishechan ke samay mata or pita se mili jaankaree yadrichhik dhang se jud jaati he
 This can be compared to playing cards where an organism gets half its leaves at random from the mother and the other half at random from the father
 mendal ne is jaankaree ko factors kaha, par baad main jin naam zyada prachlit ho gaya
 Genes are the basic unit of genetics
 inamen vah jaankaree hoti he jo jeev ke shaareerik vikaas or vyavhaar ko nirdeshit karti he
 Genes are made of DNA
 diene ek lanbaa anu he jo newcliotide kehalaae jane vaale chote anuon se banataa he
 Genetic information is stored in DNA as a series of nucleotides
 diene kii tulana ek lekh se kii ja sakati he jisamen newcliotide varnon kaa kaam karte hai
 Just as an article composed of a series of characters stores information, DNA composed of a series of nucleotides stores genetic information
 jin diene kii varnmaala ke varnon se bane nirdesh hote hai
 All genes come together like an "instruction manual" which contains all the information about making and functioning an organism
 diene main likhe gaye in nirdeshon kaa utparivartan ke kaaran badalanaa aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata ko badhata he
 DNA is contained in chromosomes inside the capillaries
 nishechan ke samay mata-pita se mili chromosomon ke yadrichhik mishran se santan ko jeenon kaa adwitiya sangyojan miltaa he
 This random mixing of genes during sexual reproduction also increases the genetic variation of the population
 aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata kisi duusari aabaadi ke saath prajnan karne se bhi badhati he
 For this reason, the population may have genes which were not already present in it
 kram-vikaas ek yadrichhik prakriya nahin he
 Although mutations in DNA occur randomly, natural selection is not a random process, the probability of survival and reproduction depends on the environment
 kram-vikaas arabon varshon ke trutipurna pratilipikaran par prakritik varan kaa parinaam he
 The result of evolution is not a well-formed organism
 prakritik varan kaa parinaam apane maujuuda parivesh ke anukulit jeev hote hai
 Progress is not progress towards any ultimate goal
 kram-vikaas zyada viksit, zyada budhimaan yaa zyada jatil jeev banane kaa prayaas nahin karata he
 For example, the flea scorpion is a descendant of a winged creature called a fly, and pythons still have small structures that are remnants of their ancestors' hind legs
 parivesh main teevr parivartan aam taur par adhiktam jatiyon ko vilupt kar detaa he
 More than 99 percent of the castes on the earth have become extinct
 prithvi par jivan kii shruwaat ke baad se paanch pramukh samuhik viluptiyaan ho chuki hai
 Due to these there has been a big and sudden decline in the diversity of castes
 in main sabase tazaa kriteshs-peliosin vilupti ghatana he, jo 6
6 karod varsh purv hui thi
 Genetic drift refers to the change in the frequency of alleles in the populations of a caste
 elil kisi jin ke vibhinn roopantaron ko kehete hai
 They determine hair color, skin color, eye color, blood type etc
 genetic drift aabaadi main nae elil nahin laati he, par ye kisi elil ko aabaadi se hataa kar genetic vividhta ko kam kar sakati he
 Genetic drift occurs by random selection of alleles
 chayan sahi myne main yadrichhik tab hota he jab us par koi bahari bal prabhaav nahin daalata he
 For example, a random selection is to remove some marbles from an opaque bag filled with marbles of different colors at the same measurement and weight
 koi shaks apane elil apane bacchon ko de paaegaa yaa nahin, ye uske jivit rahane par nirbhar karata he jisamen sanyog bhi bhoomika nibhaataa he
 This process of changing the frequency of alleles in the population due to coincidence is called genetic drift
 genetic drift badi aabaadiyon kii tulana main choti aabaadiyon par zyada prabhaav daalati he
 The Hardy – Weinberg rule states that the frequency of alleles will not change over generations in a large population occurring in the Hardy – Weinberg society
 magar ek paryaapt aakaar kii aabaadi kaa is samyavastha main pahunchnaa asambhav he kyonki is samyavastha main pahunchane ke liye ye paanch chijen jaruri hai
 1) The population size should be infinite
 2) utparivartan kii dar shunya pratishat honi chahie, kyonki utparivartan eleelon ko badal saktaa he yaa nae elil bana saktaa he
 3) There should not be migration from or into the population, as individuals coming into or leaving the population can change the frequency of alleles
 4) aabaadi par koi chaynaatmak dabaav nahin hone chahie, arthath kisi shaks ke uttarjivan yaa prajnan kii sambhaavna dusron se zyada nahin honi chahie
 5) The intercourse should be completely random, where all males are equally attractive mates
 yah alilon kii sahi myne main yadrichhik milawat sunishchit karata he
 The population in the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium corresponds to a deck of cards; Regardless of the number of times the deck is thrown, there will be no new leaf and no leaf will come out
 yahan aabaadi main eleelon kii tulana deck ke patton se kii gai he
 Population Bottlenac refers to the rapid decline of a race's population due to environmental events
 ek sahi myne main yadrichhik aabaadi bottlenake kisi elil kaa paksh nahin letaa he; arthath yah yadrichhik hota he ki koun se shaks jivit rahenge
 a bottleneck can reduce or eliminate the genetic diversity of a population
 iske baad kii genetic drift aabaadi kii genetic vividhta ko or kam kar sakati he
 Lack of genetic diversity may place populations at risk of other selective pressures
 aabaadi bottlenake kaa ek udhaaharan "uttari eliphant jalavyaghr" he
 The population of the Northern Elephant Sea was reduced by thirty persons due to the excessive hunting of the 19th
 sangrakshan ke kaaran in kii aabaadi ek lakh se zyada ho gai he or lagaataar bad rahi he
 The effects of bottleneck on the population are clearly visible
 aabaadi main genetic vividhta ke abhaav main in jalavyaghron ko rogon se kaaphi khatra he or anuvanshiki vikaar hone kii bahut sambhaavna he
 The founder's influence occurs when a small group of populations diverge from the rest of the population to form a new population
 aksar iskaa kaaran bhugolic algaav hota he
 The frequency of alleles in this new population is often different from that of the old population
 agali pidiyon kii genetic banaavat sansthaapakon kii genetic banaavat par nirbhar karegi jo puraani aabaadi se alag hogi
 An example of the founder's influence is found in the 1744 Pennsylvania transfusion of the Amish people
 amishon kii pencilvenia kii colony ke do sansthaapakon main elice–vine creveld sanglakshan ke risasive elil the
 Due to the practice of Amish people not marrying outside their community for many generations, the frequency of Ellis-van Kreveld syndrome among them is much higher than the rest of the population
 dilli chhavnee dilli ke dakshin pashchim dilli jila kaa ek up mandal he
 Delhi Cantonment is also a bus stop on the Ring Road of Delhi
 rani sati, rajasthan kii ek virangana thim jinhen narayani devi yaa dadiji bhi kehete hai
 Their lifetimes are not exactly known, but between the 13th and 17th centuries, they are considered lifetimes
 apane pati ke mrityu ke pashchaat ve sati ho gayin thim
 Many temples have been built in Rajasthan and other places in his name, out of which the Rani Sati temple of Jhunjhunu is very grand and famous
 organaijar bharat me prakashit hone vaala ek angreji bhashaa kaa samachar patr he
 Chickenpox is a viral disease
 shwasashoth ek sankramak beemaari thi, jo do virus prakaaron, werola pramukh or werola naaballig ke kaaran hoti he
 The disease is also known by the Latin name Vherola or Vherola Vera, derived from the derivative or vars
 mul rup se angreji main "pox" yaa "laal plig" ke rup main janaa jaataa he; 15 veen shatabdi main "shwetpox" shabd kaa istemaal sabase pehle "mahaan pox" 
 The last naturally occurring case of checkopox was diagnosed on October 26, 1977
 chechak ke saath sankraman prasaarit hone se pehle twachaa ke chote rakt vahikaaon or munh or gale main kendrit he
 This is the result of a specific rash in the skin and, later, raised fluid-filled blisters
 ve
 The major produced a more severe disease and had an overall mortality rate of 30–35 percent
 ve
 The minor causes a minor disease that killed about a percentage of those who infect it
 veeki lambii avadhi kii jatiltaaon main pramukh sankraman, aam taur par chehre par hota he, jo ki 65-85 pratishat jivit bache hue hote hai
 Corneal ulceration and scarring, and blindness resulting from organ deformity due to arthritis and osteomyelitis were less common complications, seen in about 2–5 percent of cases
 mana jaataa he ki smopius ko manushyon dwaara mul rup se 16,000 se 68,000 saal pehle ek bhu-stareey africa krintak se jhunus ke rup main krishi or sabhyataa kii shuruyaat se pehle adhigrahan kar liya gaya tha
 The earliest physical evidence of this is possibly the pustule rash on the bodies of Pharaoh Ramses v of Egypt
 18 veen shatabdi ke samaapan varsh ke dauraan beemaari ne lagbhag 400,000 europiyanon ko maar diya, or sabhi andhapanon ke ek tihaai ke liye jimmedaar tha

 20 veen shatabdi ke dauraan lagbhag 300-500 million logon kii maut ke liye chempks jimmedaar tha
 As recently as 1967, the World Health Organization estimated that 15 million people contracted the disease and 2 million died that year
 19veen or 20 veen shatabdi ke dauraan tikaakaran abhiyaanon ke baad, dabluechao ne 1980 main sheethal ke vaishvik unmoolan ko pramanit kiya
 Arthritis is one of two infectious diseases that have been destroyed, and the other that ended in 2011
 yah rog atyant pracheen he
 It is found in the texts of Ayurveda

 Scholars considered his check
 china main bhi isa ke kai shatabdi purv is rog kaa varnan paaya jaataa he
 The disease reached Europe in the sixth century and was transmitted to the United States by residents of Spain in the 16th century
 san 1718 main europe main ladi meri vortle montague ne pehali baar isaki sui prachlit kii or san 1796 main jiner ne iske tike kaa avishkaar kiya
 Smallpox is a viral disease, it spreads only in humans, for which two viruses are believed to be responsible Virola Major and Virola Minor
 Viruses of this disease show effect in the small blood vessel, mouth, throat of the skin, the major virus is more lethal, its death rate is 30–35%, due to this, problems like face spots, blindness have been occurring, Minor virus death is very low
 yah rog atyant sankramak he
 When then the epidemic of disease spreads
 koi bhi jati or aayu isse nahin bachi he
 Before the invention of the vaccine, there was a lot of death from this disease, this disease has been afflicting mankind since ten thousand BC, 4 million people died in Europe every year in the 18th century, this 1 / 3
 It was also responsible for the case of blindness, with a mortality rate of 20-60% of total infections and 80% in children
 Even in the twentieth century, 300 to 500 million deaths have been reported from it, as early as 1950 it had 50 There were million cases, even in 1967, the world Due to this, the health organization was supposed to have 2 million deaths worldwide every year, due to the entire 19th and 20th century vaccination campaigns, the disease was completely eradicated in December 1979, the only infectious disease in the history till date
 Is completely eradicated
 rog kaa kaaran ek virus hota he, jo rogi ke nasikasrav or thook tathaa twachaa se prutham honevaale khuradon main rahata he or bindusankraman dwaara failata he
 Khurnd is also pulverized and causes diseases to spread by clothing or other items
 yah virus bhi do prakaar kaa hota he
 One furious, which causes extreme disease, the other mild, causing mildew disease
 gaayon main rog utpann karanevaala virus praayah manushya ko aakraant nahin karata or na vah ek vyakti se duusare main pahunchataa he
 The origin of the disease is said to be two weeks , but it can be less than that

 There is a rash similar to hives on the skin
 munh main, gale main tathaa swaryantr tak choti-choti sphoticas ban jaati he, jo aage chalakar vranon main parinat ho jaati hai
 On the third or fourth day and sometimes on the second day, a special sign of smallpox appears

 These discolored spots also undergo changes in certain order
 kuch ghanton main in dhabbon se piticaay ban jaati hai, jo sookshm ankuron ke samaan hoti hai
 These plates keep coming out for two to three days, then they start to convert into sphincter
 jo pitica pahile nikalati he, vah pehle sphotica banati he
 In about 24 hours all blasticles are formed
 prayek sphotica ubhare hue dane ke samaan hoti hai, jisamen svachh drav bharaa hota he
 In two to three days, this fluid becomes pooled and becomes a bacterium, around which a red circle of inflammation occurs in the skin
 is samay vah fever, jo kam ho jaataa athwa utar jaataa he, phir se bad jaataa he
 In the next eight or nine days, the phosphates begin to dry up and become dark brown, dark black, which takes 10–12 or even more days to completely separate from the skin
 pitica or sphotica avasthaa main rogi kii dasha kshtdaayi nahin hoti, kintu pussphoticoon ke banane par fever ke badhane ke saath hi uski dasha bhi ugr or kshtdaayi ho jaati he
 Penetration of staphylo or strepto cocci into the skin leads to inflammation in the skin along with the build up of pulmonaries and ulcers in the mouth, throat, larynx etc
 nimonia bhi ho saktaa he
 It is necessary to know all three forms of the disease
 viral rup main sphoticas thodi tathaa dur-dur hoti hai
 Because of this, there is no excess inflammation on the skin
 duusare rup main sphoticas bade aakaar kii or paas-paas hoti hai

 Therefore, it is extremely important that the planning, planning and procedures for attending meetings are well understood
 ek ucch stareey karypalak jise baithak kii adhyakshata kerani hoti he ke vaiyaktik sahaayak / nijee sahaayak se sakriy sanliptata kii ummid kii jaati he
 a meeting of two or more persons is called a meeting to consider certain matters, make recommendations and take decisions
 ``kisi kendrit vaarta jisaki ek vishesh kaarysoochee ho`` ko ham baithak ke rup main paribhashit kar sakate hai
 It is clear from this definition that the meeting is not an aimless dialogue but requires careful planning and revolves around a particular topic that has already been decided
 at:baithken sanghathan ke aasaan va sugam prachaalan main sahaayak hoti hai
 These provide an opportunity for members of the organization to have face-to-face talks and direct exchange of ideas
 nimnlikhit prayojanon ke liye baithkon kaa aayojan kiya janaa chahie: Meetings are of various types
 vyapak taur par inhen saarvajanik tathaa vyavasayik baitka main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 As mentioned earlier, meetings should be planned ahead of time so that they can be successfully organized
 baithak ke aayojan main sarvapratham kadam yah he ki ise uchit rup se sanchalit tathaa gathit kiya jaae
 a meeting can be said to be properly organized only when the notice of the meeting is issued to all the persons by the appropriate authority
 ek baithak tabhi vidhivat gathit hoti he jab baithak kii adhyakshata karne ke liye uchit vyakti asin ho tathaa vyaktiyon kii apekshit ganapurti upasthit ho jo usamen sammilit hone tathaa vot dene ke paatr hai
 Therefore, an individual assistant / private secretary must have knowledge of the legitimate action required for the meeting
 aadhisuchana baithak kii agrim soochna he taki soochna praapt karne vaale vyakti ko baithak ke liye apane aap ko taiyaar karne kaa avasar mil jaae
 The issuer notification is mandatory for all members attending the meeting
 aadhisuchana sambandhit sanghathan yaa nikaay ke niyamon yaa sanvidhik praavdhaanon main nirdhaarit rup main jari kii jaani chahie
 The information should always be given in writing
 baithak ko bulaae jane ke liye apekshit avadhi kaa nirdhaaran bhi sanghathan ke niyamon tathaa sanvidhik praavdhaanon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 For example, in case of annual general meeting of the company, the notification of the meeting should reach the members 21 days before the meeting

 The day, time and place of the meeting should be mentioned in the notification of the meeting
 isamen baithak ke uddeshy tathaa prakruti kaa bhi ullekh hona chahie
 If required under the rules, copies of certain reports, statements etc
 should also be sent as an attachment or attachment to the notification
 varshik aam baithak kii aadhisuchana tathaa kaarysoochee kaa namoona is paath ke ant main diya gaya he
 It is a traditional practice to provide the agenda of the meeting with the notification of the meeting to the members attending the meeting
 baithak main puure kiye jane vaale kaaryo ke vivaran kaa kaarykram `kaarysoochee` kehalaati he
 The details of the program are given in the order in which they are considered in the same order
 kaarysoochee samiti yaa sanghathan ke sabhi sadasyon ko bheji jaati he taki unhen baithak se pehle hi baithak main charchaa kiye jane vaale vyavasayik muddon kaa adhyayan karne kaa paryaapt samay praapt ho sake
 This agenda is prepared by the Secretary in consultation with the Chairman and while preparing it, the work items of the previous meeting are also taken into consideration
 sachiv ko un muddon par ek note taiyaar karnaa chahie jis par sadasyon ke dhyanakarshan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taki unhen agali baithak kii kaarysoochee main shamil kiya ja sake
 The agenda items of the meeting should be prepared from the following sources: kaarysoochee baithak kii aadhisuchana kaa bhaag bhi ho saktaa he or ise aadhisuchana ke saath sanlagn bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 When the agenda is included as an attachment to the notification or circulated separately, it contains the following information: yadhyapi kaarysoochee aadhisuchana kaa hi bhaag hoti he phir bhi isamen keval uthaae jane vaale muddon ko hi shamil kiya jaataa he kyonki aadhisuchana main anya byore pehle se vidyaman hote hai
 Normally the first item of the agenda is 'confirmation of the working of the previous meeting' and the last item is 'permission of an issue with the permission of the Speaker'
 anya muddon kii vyavastha unke mahatv ke aadhaar par kii jaati he
 The meeting should take routine issues first and controversial issues later
 kaarysoochee ko do tareekon se taiyaar kiya ja saktaa he: The agenda of the Speaker contains more information than the general agenda and a blank space is left on the right side of the paper for the Speaker's comments
 atirikt soochna adhyaksh ko sabhi sambandhit vivaran pradaan karti he jisaki baithak ke dauraan aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Meeting cannot be initiated without quorum
 shabd `korum` kii utpatti latin bhashaa se hui or ise niyamon yaa sanvidhik praavdhaanon dwaara apekshit anusaar baithak main aanivary rup se upasthit hone vaale sadasyon kii nunatam sankhya ke rup main paribhashit kiya jaataa he ganapurti puri nahin he to baithak kaa sahi thang se aayojan nahin ho paata he
 If the main purpose of quorum is to prevent any decision being taken on the small number of members present in the meeting, which is acceptable to most of the members
 ganapurti ke liye apekshit sadasyon kii sankhya kaa byora sanghathan ke niyamon main hota he
 5û Speaker: The head of the meeting is called the Speaker
 ek vaid baithak ke liye ek anya mahatvapurn apeksha yah he ki ise niyamon or sanvidhik praavdhaanon ke anusaar baithak kii kaarividhi ko uchit dhang se sanchalit karne ke liye baithak kii adhyakshata adhyaksh dwaara kii jaati he
 The Chairman is the person appointed to preside over and organize the proceedings of the meeting
 inaki niyukti nimnlikhit prayojanon se kii jaati he: To carry out these duties, the Chairman is given the following powers or authority: baithak kii kaarywahi prastaavon ke anusaar chalati he
 The proposal is included before the meeting for consideration and decision making
 yah prastaav likhit rup main hona chahie tathaa baithak se purv adhyaksh yaa sachiv ko saunpa janaa chahie
 The member who wants the motion to be moved will first take the permission of the Speaker and then present the proposal to the meeting
 is prastaav ko laane vaale sadsy ko is vishay par bolne tathaa charchaa ke ant main prashnon ke uttar dene kaa aadhikaar hota he
 This motion is then endorsed by another member and this member is called a supporter
 yadi baithak main koi sadsy prastaav kaa samarthan nahin karata he to is prastaav ko chhod diya jaataa he or ise pun: uthaaya nahin jaataa he
 If a motion is presented by the Speaker, it does not require a supporter
 prastaav ko aupcharik rup se baithak ke samaksh prastut kiye jane ke pashchaat, adhyaksh sadasyon ko apane vichaar vyakt karne ko kehete hai
 Thus, when a motion is put in a meeting it becomes a 'question' and after a decision is taken on it after discussion, it is passed, then it becomes a 'resolution'
 kaarysoochee main shamil kiye bina bhi prastaav ko laayaa ja saktaa he kintu yadi `tatklikta ke prayojan` ke rup main shamil kiye jane arthath `kisi anya kaary` ke liye adhyaksh sahmati pradaan kare yaa ise paramparaagat mad main shamil kiya jaae
 After the resolution is accepted and recorded in the meeting's office, it becomes the official decision of the meeting
 ise paramparaagat rup se prastavit, samarthit tathaa baithak ke samaksh prastut kiya janaa chahie
 a resolution cannot be disbanded in a meeting in which it is accepted
 isprakaar, sankalp ko baithak ke samaksh prastut kisi prastaav par aupcharik nirnay ke rup main paribhashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Generally, the rules propose to change two types of resolutions: general resolution and special resolution
 jab ek sankalp saamaanya bahumat se parit hota he to use saamaanya sankalp kehete hai
 Thus a simple majority means that the votes in favor of the resolution are more than the votes of the opposition
 vishesh sankalp vah sankalp he jise teen-chauthai bahumat se parit kiya jaataa he
 Thus, the votes in favor of a special resolution should be three times more than the votes of the opposition
 vishesh sankalp se parit kiye jane vaale muddon ko sambandhit nikaay ke niyamon main vinirdisht kiya jaataa he
 a motion for amendment can be made before it is voted on or accepted
 sanshodhan ek prastaav he jiske dwaara prastaav ke kuch shabdon ko joda yaa nikaala ja saktaa he
 It should be traditionally supported and presented in the meeting
 jab koi prastaav sanshodhit, samarpit tathaa sweekaar kiya jaataa he to mul prastaav par charchaa ko rokkar sanshodhit prastaav par charchaa armbh ho jaati he
 After discussion it is voted on and if it is passed then the original proposal is amended
 parivartit prastaav ko `mul prastaav ` kaha jaataa he or tatpashchaat use baithak ke saamne prastut kiya jaataa he
 If the vote is not in favor of the amendment, discussion on the base motion is restored
 sanghathan ke anuchhedon, niyamon tathaa sanvidhik praavdhaanon ke maddenjar, adhyaksh sadasyon kii sahmati se baithak kii kaarywahi ko lambit karne ke liye use sthagit kar saktaa he
 This means that the proceedings of the meeting are pending for a fixed or indefinite period
 yah sthagan aadesh prayek prastaav ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 When the adjournment order is duly promulgated, supported for the main motion, the discussion on the initial motion is stopped
 yadi sthagan prastaav sweekrut ho jaataa he to ise sahamat tithi yaa anishchit kaal ke liye sthagit kar diy jaataa he or sthagan prastaav par charchaa kii jaati he or matdaan kiya jaataa he
 The Speaker may, under his authority, adjourn the meeting or discussion for goodwill purpose
 anya sthitiyon main bhi vah baithak yaa charchaa ko sthagit kar saktaa he, jab baithak kii ganapurti na ho yaa baithak ke dauraan kaaphi avyavashtha ho jaae jiske kaaran baithak kii kaarywahi ko chalaa paanaa sambhav na ho yaa ballat dwaara matdaan yaa pole ke liye samay kii aavashyaktaa ho yaa vivaadaaspad binduon par soochna praapt kerani ho to vah apni ichha yaa khushi ke liye baithak kii sampti tak isaki kaarywahi ko nahin roak saktaa he
 Notification of the adjournment meeting is not issued as it is considered part of the same meeting and the date, time and place of this meeting is generally decided at the time of the adjournment motion
 yadi baithak ko aanishichat kaal ke liye yaa das din se aadhik samay ke liye sthagit kiya jaataa he to nai aadhisuchana jari karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 When the discussion on a particular proposal is in progress, some members may raise a 'question of order'
 vyavastha kaa prashn baithak kii kaaryvahiyon yaa maanak adeshon yaa baithak ke sanrachana se sambandhit hota he
 For example, the member may draw the attention of the Speaker to issues related to the proceedings of the meeting, such as non-completion of the quorum or the motion placed before the meeting, not subject to the scope of the meeting or displaying inappropriate language or abusive behavior in the meeting
 Ho
 jab vyavastha kaa prashn uthaaya jaataa he to mukhya prastaav par ho rahi charchaa ko roak diya jaataa he
 The Speaker gives his decision immediately and is final and binding on all
 vyavastha ke prashn ke niptaan ke pashchaat, mukhya prastaav par charchaa pun:aarambh kar di jaati he
 The literal meaning of 'minutes' is to preserve cognition
 ise baithak kii kaarywahi ke abhilekhon ke rup main paribhashit kiya ja saktaa he jinhen sankshipt, sateek tathaa suspasht rup ke ricard kiya jaataa he
 The Secretary is responsible for attending the meeting and writing the details of the decisions taken
 yah atyant aavashyak he ki parit kiye gaye prayek sankalp or prastaavkarta va samarthankartaaon ke naam abhilikhit kiye jaaen
 The primary responsibility for preparing the minutes of the meeting rests with the executive

 It should be knowledge of typing work type
 kaaryvritt do prakaar ke hote hai
 It is beneficial to keep minutes in open pages because they can be typed easily
 yadi yah tarika apanaaya jaataa he to uski suraksha ko sunishchit kiya janaa aavashyak he
 It is important to keep the work room safe because this meeting is an important permanent record of the proceedings of the meeting which is helpful in mentioning the revision of the business later
 isse yah dhundne main sahaayta milti he ki kuch nirnay kyon liye gaye hai
 Work hall should be prepared immediately after the meeting because they remember at that time
 inhen tisare vyakti ke rup main beete gaye samyaanusaar likhnaa chahie
 The workplace should be perfect so that it displays the correct procedures
 sankshep aisa ho jisase mahatvapurn vishyon par vaarta or liye gaye nirnyon ke agali baithak main sunishchit karnaa taki jo baithak main anupasthit the unhen kaaryvahiyon se purna rup se avgat karaayaa ja sake or purv vichaar-vimarsh main kisi prakaar kaa sandeh na rahe
 The draft work is often made in successive paragraphs, in numbers, and in appropriate sub-titles

 As Secretary, you have to repeatedly use many technical terms related to business meetings during your work
 prayog hone vaale sarvaadhik saamaanya shabd hai: Co-housing is a deliberate community of private houses that are built in a common place
 har judaa hua yaa akelaa paariwarik ghar parmparik suvidhaayen rakhata he, jinamein nijee rasoi shaamil he
 Shared spaces typically include a common house, which includes a large kitchen and restaurant, laundry area and recreation spaces
 ghar ke baahar ke saajhe kshetra main vaahan-kshetra, tahalne ke kshetra, khuli jagah or bageeche ho sakate hai
 Neighbors also use resources such as tools and lawn-movers together
 har ghar kii apni kamai or nijee zindagi hoti he, parantu padosi mil-julkar samudaay kii gatividhiyon or sajhi jagah ko chalaate hai
 The legal structure is usually a homemaker association or housing cooperative society
 samudaay kii gatividhiyon main samay-samay par yojit saajha bhojan, baithak or milakar kaam karne ke din hote hai
 Neighbors gather for banquets, games, films or other festivals
 sah-awaas kii sahaayta se klbon kaa bananaa, bacchon or buzurgon kii dekh-rekh or car-pool karnaa sambhav hota he
 Co-housing makes it possible to exchange between neighbors which brings social, experimental, economic or environmental benefits
 sah-awaas samudaayon main aat taur kuch visheshtaayen samaan hua karti hai
 Co-housing communities are generally structured - theoretically and often in the form of construction
 isse adhik se adhik sadasyon ke bich paraspar aadan-pradaan sambhav hota he
 Neighbors are encouraged to cooperate among the community and pay attention to their neighbors
 sah-awaas kaa vikaas aam taur se jaan-boojhkar 20-40 gharon tak hi simit hota he or zyaadaatar nivaasiyon ke bich paraspar aadan-pradaan ke liye bahut badi sajhi jagah uplabdh hoti he
 While the development of co-housing is meant to encourage a sense of community, there remains as much personal privacy among residents as they wish to maintain
 yahan ke nivasee is baat main sakasham hai ki ve mil-julne kii seemaa tay karen taaki ve apni niztaa or samudaay ke bich sateek santulan banaae rakhen
 Decision making in co-housing communities is dependent on maintaining consensus among themselves
 yahan ke nivasee sajhi jagah gherte hai jise sab istemaal karte hai, jisase paison kii bachat hoti he; phir bhi, nivasee apni jagah ko swayan bhi sambhaal sakate hai jo unke liye mahatvapurn he
 Residents of co-housing communities often value values for which the entire community works
 udhaaharan ke taur par kai sah-awaas samudaay sansadhano kaa sandharniya upyog karte hai, jiske liye sajhi jagah kaa upyog suvidhajanak siddh hota he

 The use of the term by the media may contribute to widespread awareness and interest, but many scientists find the name inappropriate, because it is a sensational exaggeration and misleads readers, this particle has nothing to do with God
 It leaves many open questions in fundamental physics and does not explain the ultimate origin of the universe

 jab sam batal kii vidhwaa patni se milane jaataa he, to vah pataa he ki, jill clayton, joki batal parivaar ke ghar ke upar rahane vaali unki padosi he, vah bilkul us ladki jaisi he joki uske sapanom main aati he
 Jill is trying to help Mrs
 Butle to find out what happened to her husband, but she is upset while negotiating with the bureaucracy
 use pataa nahin hota he, par ab vah anjaane main tatal kii aatankwaadi dost samajhi jane lagati he kyunki vah sarkari naukaron ke is raaj kaa khulaasa karnaa chaahati he ki unhone tatal kii jagah par batal ko giraftaar kar liya, joki apni is galati ko kabhi sweekaar nahin karenge
 When Sam tries to talk to her, she is very cautious and refrains from giving full details to Sam, worrying that the government will find him
 During this time, Sam gets in touch with the real Harry Tuttle, who is currently a run-down air condition specialist and was previously a government employee but quit his government job due to more paperwork
 tatal un do sarkari karmchaariyon se nipatane main sam kii madad karata he jo sam ke ghar par toote air condishnar ko banane main lage hai
 Sam decides that the only way to know about Jill is by transferring to the "information Retrieval" from where he can access her classified information
 vah apni maan ida se madad ke liye prarthana karata he kyunki uski pahunch oonche adhikariyon tak he or vah apane bete ko ah pad dilwane main uski madad kar sakati he, vah vyarth main hi, cosmetic sarjan doctor jeff ke sangrakshan main plastic surgery main naveen parivartan laane kii sanak se grast he
 Pleased that his son finally showed some ambition - before he rejected all the promotions his mother had arranged - Sam's mother arranges for Sam to be promoted in the Information Retrieval Department
 antat sam ko jill ke bare main sabhi soochna mil jaati he or vah uske giraftaar ho paane se pehle use khoj nikaalata he, iske baad use mrit dikhaane ke liye usase sambandhit abhi soochnaaon ko jhootha sabit karata he, isse vah sarkari adhikariyon ke chakkaron se batch jaati he
 Sam is arrested by the government at gunpoint for misusing his position, but Sam and Jill spend a romantic night together before that
 sam ko apane mitra jaik lint ke dwaara pratadit kiye jane ke liye ek bade, khaali gol kamare main ek kursi se baandh diya jaataa he, kyunki ab yah man ja rahaa he ki vah bhi jill or tatal ke saath kisi aatankwaadi yojana main shaamil he
 However, Tuttle and the other members attack the ministry before Jack is able to do something before he is taken hostage
 bandhakon kaa samooh jaik ko goli maar detaa he, sam ko bachaa letaa he or bhaagane se pehle mantralay ke bhawan ko visphot dwaara uda detaa he
 Sam and Tuttle run away together, but Tuttle is lost somewhere among a pile of remnants of the Ministry building
 sam apni maan ke paas bhaagta he jo apane ek mitra kii antimakriya main shaamil ho rahi thi, jisaki mrityu atyadhik cosmetic surgery kaaran ho jaati he
 There Sam discovers that his mother is now looking like Jill and that a group of young fans were cheering him on seeing Sam fall into an open box and find that he is surfaceless
 vah apane sapanom main ek kaalpanik duniya main pahunch jaataa he, or police or kaalpanik daityon ke taron se bani naliyon ke dher se bachane kaa prayaas karata he
 At the top of that pile he finds a door, he passes through it and is surprised to see Jill taking him to a trailer
 donon ek saath milakar us shahar se chale jate hai
 However, in the end it is shown that this happy ending is happening only in Sam's brain; While in fact Sam is tied to the chair under the supervision of Jack and Deputy Minister Mr
 Helpman
 jab vah donon yah dekhte hai ki sam muskura rahaa he or "brazil" gaanaa ga rahaa he to vah asaamaanya lagata he, vah donon yah tay kar lete he ki sam pagal ho chukaa he or kamare se bahaar nikal jate hai, iske saath hi film khatm ho jaati he
 Gilliam developed the story and wrote the first draft of the plot with Charles Elverson, who was paid for the work, but in the end was not credited for the film
 lagbhag 20 varsh tak, gilium is baat se inkaar karte rahe kii elversan ne is film kii kahani main koi bhi vaastavik yogadan diya he
 But then when the first draft was printed and papers related to the development of the actual story were obtained from Elverson's file, Gilliam reluctantly changed the story
 par ab tak elversan ke liye phil main shrey paane yaa asafal auskar namakan suchi main sthaan paane ke liye thodi der ho chuki thi
 He said that he had no objection to getting an Oscar nomination, though he had not given much thought to the story or the finished film

 Brazil was produced under the title The Ministry and 1984 1⁄2, the second title was not only similar to Orwell's 1984 but also to Federico Fellini's 81⁄2, which is the director named Gilliam as a director who influenced his visual style of direction
 Take it often
 film ke nirmaan ke dauraan, anya kai kaaryvahak sheershakon kaa bhi naam aayaa, jisame brazil sheershak, joki film kii pramukh dhun escapist ke naam se judaa he, ko sunishchit karne se pehle da ministry of torchar, haau ai larnd tu liv vid da system - so for or so dats vaai da barjiosis sax, par vichaar kiya gaya tha
 Gilliam sometimes refers to the film as the second film of his "fictional trio", with the first Time Bandits and the last The Adventures of Baron Manchousse
 yah sabhi "hamaare ajeebogareeb tareeke se vyavasthit samaaj ke sanakeepan or kisi bhi sambhav madhyam dwaara isse palaayan kii ichha" ke bare main hai
 All three films focus on these struggles and attempt to flee them through the arts - in Time Bandits it is a child, in Brazil, a man in his thirties, and Manchausen, in this one It has been done with the view of an older person
 gilium ne kaha he ki brazil jorge orvel kii 1984 se prerit he- jise kabhi naa padhane kii baat unhone sweekaar kii he - lekin yah film orvel ke samaan bhavishya main dekhakar nahin balki aaj ke drushtikon se likhi gayi he
 In Gilliam's words, his film was titled "the Nineteen eighty-four for 1984"
 robert di nero, vastav main jaik kii bhoomika karnaa chaahate the, lekin gilium pehle hi vah bhoomika micel pelin ko dene kaa vaada kar chuke the

 Gilliam himself also appears in the film as a small, important, cigarette-smoking mysterious man who was spying on Sam while going to meet the Batley family
 da village voyes ke micel atkinson ne likhaa, "gilium yah samajhate the ki sabhi bhavishya aadhaarit filmein antat ek ajeeb tareeke se us nirdosh ateet ko tazaa kar detii hai jisame vah banaai gayi thim or unhone is siddhant ko ek susangat hasya saundarya main badal diya
" isko unke saathi film-nirmaataaon jin-piyare jenyuate or mark kairo dwaara "pracheen-bhavishyavaad"*- kaa naam diya gaya
 Commonly called "sai-fi Noir", it is "a vision of what the 1980s would look like when viewed from the point of view of a 1940s filmmaker
" It is an effect of the 40s genre in Sam's reality: Fritz Leng's films, or Humphrey Bogart: "on the other hand, the film is a compiler but consistent mix of genres and production designs taken from the film genre pictures

 "many critics have also seen various effects of the original, more formidable, German Expressionism of the 1920s, which was the ancestor of the 1940s film genre, this effect is usually seen when looking at how Gilliam's lighting and set The design is cleverly used
 prakaash vyavastha v set ke dizin ke sambandh main sankalak kala-marmagrata or prayek vistaar ke prati dhyaan, gilium ke chaudee lenson v jhukaav yukt camere ke kone ke vishisht shauk ke saath sanyojit ho chuke the; yah un saadhaaran darshakon ke hisaab se kuch zyada hi chaudee ho jaati thim jinhen mukhyadhara kii hollywood filmon kii aadat thi, gilium film ke chaude konon ke liye jane vaale drishyon ko 14 mimi, 11 mimi or 9

 In fact, the 14 mm lens has now become informally known as "the Gilliam" among filmmakers, having been used many times since Brazil over the years
 ek drishy tatv joki film main pramukhataa se dikhaai padataa he vah naliyon kaa he, visheshkar saanp ke jaisi taron se bani naaliyaan, jinka prayog aadhunik nirmaan main kiya gaya he
 The film begins with an advertisement detailing the ducts available in various styles for the home, the scene is shown on television in a store, which is then blown up by the terrorists
 
 sam ke ghar main ek diwaar pramukh rup se dikhaai jaati he jisame puri diwaar par dhaatu kii pattiyaan lagi hui hai, joki ek bahut hi puraane or jatil air condishnar ko chhupaati hai- or chhadam angeniyar tatal hi ek maatr vyakti he jo is kaam ko kar paata he
 Later, Sam eats at a restaurant where a large decorative artwork is housed, whose flowers are actually wire ducts
 iske bhi baad, jab sam vidroh kii drushti se der raat main apane offis hataa he, tab sarkari bhawan ke haul kaa khalipan rakrakhaav karne vaale aadmi kii zamin chamakane vaali mashin ke dwaara dur kiya jaataa he, joki taron se bani nalikaaon kii lambi rassi ko khinchati he
 In the middle-class house of Batla, people have to make room for the ducts, which actually cause blockages in their everyday chores
 sam ke ghar main, shuruyaat main is tarah kii nalikaayen dikhaai nahin padati lekin baad main jab vah tuutti hai to unki upasthiti kaa abhas ek halke swar ke rup main sunaayi padataa he
 In the records department, these tubes are easily visible on the four sides, but only above the head of all the individuals
 Ultimately, very few such tubules appear in the dreaded Ministry of Information
 eri baroso kaa 1939 kaa gaanaa "equarela du brazil" kaa ek sanskaran jo vishesh rup se jeeyopha muldaur dwaara gaaya gaya he, vah film kii pramukh swar pankti ke rup main barbar istemaal kiya gaya he, haalaanki iske atirikt anya parshv sangeet kaa bhi prayog kiya gaya he
 Michael Cayman, who composed the music, actually recorded "brazil" with Kate Bush's voice
 yah recording vaastavik film yaa vaastavik gaanon ko jari karne ke dauraan shaamil nahin kii gayi thi; haalaanki, ise baad main gaanon ke punah pradarshan ke dauraan jari kar diya gaya tha
 The narrative that Gilliam describes casts a squeamish laugh at consumerism as one of the methods of this totalitarian society that this society uses to divert people's attention from its inherent inhumanity
 bahya drishyon main, yah dikhaaya gaya he kii log saamaanon se bhari gadiyon ko raasto par le ja rahe hai
 In one scene, a man carrying a brass band carries a sign that reads, "consumers of Christ," when a little girl is asked what she needs over Christmas, Ah immediately answers "my Own a credit card! " When Sam is being tied to a chair and has to be tortured, a police officer tells him, "don't try to deal with it, son!" Quickly accept, otherwise you risk your creditworthiness
 Will put in isi prakaar, nijee khushiyon or kalyaan se upar vrutha ahankaar or pratishtha ke arthhin vichaaron ke utkarsh kaa puri film ke dauraan pradarshan kiya gaya he
 Sam's mother and her friend, Mrs
 Terrain, undergo many cosmetic surgeries as a fad to look young and beautiful as a representative of the world's upper class
 yahan tak kii jab bagal main aatankwaadi hamale ho rahe the, us samay bhi un logon kii chintaa kaa vishay ek nayi surgery talika kaa mulya tha
 Sam was not so much obsessed with malicious characters as by the vast, formal and indifferent social system, which only pretends to be both hypocrisy and idealism
 nijee taur par koi bhi khalanaayak durbhaavna yukt yaan parapidak nahin he, vah sirf apana karttavya nibhaa rahe hai
 As a result, the main theme of the film is the futility of unknown, cremated and soulless machinery, which meet the needs of adult life in modern society
 yah nirthak, agyaat mashinari is tathy main bhi spasht he ki film kaa puraa kathanak ek makkhi ke dwaara gati main aata he, jiske bare main koi nahin jaanata
 ant main, kisi anya ko nahin balki darshak ko sabhi ghatnaon or unke kaarnon yaa kis prakaar prayek vyakti apane paatr main upyukt baithta he, ke bare main puri jaankaree hoti he
 Sam, as the most conscious character, is exposed to pieces of the puzzle through a series of mishaps, while his focus is entirely on finding and saving his girlfriend; Jill seems oblivious to the danger she faces until the last moment; And Jack, as well as the entire mechanism behind him, posing as Mr
 Helpman, has created a story of elaborate destruction and terrorism fooling himself through which he explains his own misdeeds
 iske atirikt anek rayub goldberg mashin, jaise ki ek jo sam ke khud ke ghar main he, jiskaa rosemara kaa jivan puri tarah swachaalit he, bhi is nirarthak, swachaalit aavashyaktaaon vaale sansar kii vyakhya karti hai
 This pointlessness is most strongly visible right from the beginning, during the film's most serious hilarious turn
 is baat par charchaa kii ja sakati he ki film main "aatankwaadiyon" kaa astitv or anekon "aatankwaadi" gatividhiyaan aspasht kar diya gaya he - isaki bahut sambhaavna he ki aatankwaad kaa pramukh khatra sarkaar kii shantipur vikrendikaran kii niti main he, jisase vah apni tamaam galatiyon ko chhupaati he or ek anya dushman ko bali ke bakre ke rup main prastut kar detii he
 The audience must interpret this central theme of the film in its own context — and recognize the fact that Vipritaya - perhaps there are no terrorists in reality
 is baat ke koi pratyaksh saboot nahin hai ki jill kaa visphoton se koi sambandh nahin he, yaa yahan tak ki tatal ne koi bhi aatanki kaary kiya he jiske liye sarkaar use doshi maan rahi he- vah aatma raksha ke liye bandook rakhata he or ek maatr avasar jab vah visphot main sanlagn dikhaai padataa he vah bhi baad main sam kaa ek swapn drishy nikalataa he
 Most importantly, when Jill gets excited to ask Sam if he has actually seen a terrorist, he is unable to react, because he thinks for the first time that he has never seen a real terrorist

 Universal executives felt that the film's ending did not look good, and Universal President Sid Sheinberg insisted on a re-enactment of a dramatic ending to give the film a happy ending, but Gilliam disagreed

 With the film showing no signs of delay and after much delay, Gilliam advertised a full-page ad in the commercial magazine Variety requesting Sheinberg to release Brazil in its original version
 Give permission Finally, when Gilliam made a private appearance of the film and Brazil received the "best Film" award by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, which allowed Universal to release a refined 131-minute, 1985-minute version of the film, overseen by Gilliam

 But the term was more commonly used after the Malegaon blast in Mumbai on September 29, 2008, as people belonging to a Hindu organization, allegedly associated with the blast, were arrested in connection with the investigation

 Responding to this, Pawar said that he first used the term after the Malegaon blast

 But in Subhash Gatade's book - Godse's Children, Hindutva and Hindu have been differentiated and in Veer Savarkar's book "hindutva" Hindu has been described as a small part of Hinduism, hence Hindu is different from Hinduism

 These are of two types - kalanukramiki yaa kalkram vigyaan vah vigyaan he jiske dwaara ham aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa kalanirmaan kar sakate hai
 Therefore it is necessary that all events are displayed in a single session
 keval aisa karne par hi sab ghatnaon kaa kram or unke bich kaa vyateet kaal ham gyaat kar sakate hai
 This era can be anyone - ancient or archaic
 is kaam ke liye aajkal adhiktar isvi san kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The last year was used for this work in our country and in Europe, in ancient times and sometimes even today, Julian period is used
 jagat ke vividh deshon or vividh kaalon main alag-alag sanwat prachlit the
 Not only this, in a huge country like India, many cultures were prevalent nowadays and also in the past
 in sab sanwaton ke prachaar kaa aarambh bhinn-bhinn kaal main hua or unke varshon kaa aarambh bhi vibhinn rituon main hota tha
 Additionally, the type of calculation of year, month and day also differed
 saamanyat: varsh kaa maan rituchakra ke tulya rakhane kaa praytn kiya jaataa tha, parantu islamic sanwat hijri ke anusaar vah keval baarah chandra maason, arthath 354 dinon kaa, varsh hota tha, jo rituchakra ke tulya nahin he
 Some years were a mixture of lunar and solar, as is practiced in many provinces of India nowadays
 isamen 12 chandra maason kaa ek varsh hota he, parantu do yaa teen varshon main ek adhimaas badhaakar varsh ke madhya maan ko rituchakra ke tulya banaaya jaataa he
 Each season-cycle-like year is also called a solar year, because its value is related to the sun
 upar hamane chandramaada kaa jo ullekh kiya he usko vastut: saura chandramaada kahana chahie, kyonki uskaa aadhaar surya or chandramaa ke saath mishra rup main he
 Till the full moon or from Amavasya to Amavasya, this lunar month is respected

 Generally, the mean time from one midday to the next is called a day
 jahaan chandra maas prachlit he, jaise bharat ke vibhinn pradeshon main, tithiyon se gananaa kii jaati he, jinka sambandh pradhanat: chandramaa kii kalaon ke saath he
 Thus, we see that in different regions of the world, calculations are done from different seasons, the beginning of the year also occurs in different seasons and there are different types of census and day census
 ab yadi kisi pracheen shilaalekh main hamane padhaa ki vah din amuk sanwat ke amuk maas kaa amuk din tha to prashn uthta he ki vah thik koun sa din tha
 It is often difficult to find an answer, because when that age started, what was its year-scale, and how were its months and days counted, we cannot determine the day without knowing all these things
 isliye pehle yah aavashyak he ki jagat ke bhinn-bhinn sanwaton kaa prarambh, arthath unke pratham varsh kaa aarambh kisi ek hi pramanit kiye hue sanwaton main bataaya jaae
 There have been many vows in the world from ancient times till today
