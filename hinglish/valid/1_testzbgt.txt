 Although the tales of this great novel have been woven around the aristocratic families of the Bolkonsky, Rostov and Bezukhov surnames, and the events of Napoleon Bonaparte and Emperor Alexander I, it was in the early 19th century, before the liberation of the Russians of Russia
 Presents a living picture of
 is mahakay upanyaas main raajnneetik, kootnithik, saamaajik, dharmik, darshanik, saamaajik, maansik-bhaavnaatmak tathaa manovaigyanik aadi jivan kaa koi paksh yaa ang achoota nahin rahaa he
 In this novel, Tolstoy has tried to show that period of Russian history as the centerpiece, showing how patriotism, courage, valor and perseverance of ordinary Russian people delivered the sixes of Napoleon and his army of all-conquering victory
 
 yah itihaas ke prati tolastoy kaa kahin adhik vyapak drushtikon tha
 He wants to clarify what effect war has on people of all societies, all sides of life, all classes and categories
 isi kaaran se tolastoy ke kuch adhyetaon kaa yah maananaa he ki mul roosi main shanti ke paryaayavachi shabd 'mir' se tolastoy kaa abhipraay shanti nahin balki log janata yaa puraa samaaj he
 Keeping this view in mind, the name of this novel should not be 'war and peace' but 'war and society'
 'yuddh or shaanti' ko vishwa kaa mahanatam upanyaas hi nahin balki saahitiyik itihaas kii ek parighatna mana gaya he
 It is a complex, historical-psychological, multi-layered epic artistic structure
 saamaanya rup se isamen teen prakaar kii saamagree kaa daksh sanshleshan kiya gaya he :- Tollastoy's views on family, marriage, the status of women, the destitute of nobles, public opinion, hypocritical life etc
 and helpful criticism of the present situation as their supporting aspects also present with the story
 vistrut aitihaasik vivaran or manovaigyanik gaharaaiyon ke saath hi itihaas-darshan vishyak apane vichaaron kii nibandhaatmak prastuti ko jis dakshata ke saath upanyaas main piroyaa gaya he, vah adwitiya or vismit kar dene vaala he
 Russian author Ivan Turgenev wrote in 1880: - "this Virat novel is similar to the heroic 'epic'
 isamen hamaari shatabdi ke praarambhik varshon ke vyaktigat or saamaajik jivan kaa badi dakshata se chithran hua he
 An entire era rich with great events and great people is photographed in front of the readers 


 a whole world of many metaphorical characters drawn from real life of all social categories is revealed 


 This great author's great creation Is - this is the real Russia
 " Charles Percy Snow observes-- "tolstoy is the greatest novelist and 'war and Peace' is the best of the novels ever written
 " English writer John Galswardy called 'war and peace' the best novel ever written

 " unhone is pustak ko "19veen shatabdi kaa bhavy smarak, uskaa mukut" mana he
 Russian author Ivan Goncharov recognizes: "'war and peace' is a wonderful epic novel both in terms of content and composition
 saath hi yah ek stuty roosi yug kaa smaarkeey itihaas bhi he jisamen har paatr yaa to koi aitihaasik hasti he yaa kaanse se gadhi hui murti ke samaan he
 Distinctive characteristics of Russian folk life have been realized in even minor characters
 " The French writer François Moriac was impressed by the novel to the extent that he wrote: - "I cannot say that i have read 'war and Peace'"

 " ernest hemengue kaa kahana he -- "meri najar main to koi bhi aisa lekhak nahin he jisane yuddh ke bare main tolsatoy se behatar likhaa ho

 " lenin ke hawaale se maxim gorki ne likhaa he ki europe main koi aisa anya lekhak nahin he jisaki unase tulana kii ja sake
 While giving a narrative touch on the way humans move towards disorganization by considering themselves as independent, and the state of various anomalies and irony arising from it, Tolstoy expresses the tentative idea of how the difficulty of astronomy assumes the motion of the Earth
 There was a direct feeling of stability and a refusal of similar sensations of planetary motion, Thus, it is difficult for history to believe that every person is subject to problems, periods and reasons, because in order to do so, he must deny the direct feeling of freedom of his personality
 parantu, jaisaa ki khagolashastra main nayaa drushtikon kahata tha : "sach he ki ham prithvi kii gati ko mahasoos nahin karte, par uski sthirataa ko maanakar ham anargalata par pahunchate hai, jabaki gati ko maanakar, jise ham mahasoos nahin karte, niyam pate hai", -- isi prakaar itihaas main bhi nayaa drushtikon kahata he : " yah sach he ki ham apni adheenta ko mahasoos nahin karte, par apni swatantraaa ko maanakar ham anargalata par pahunchate hai, jabaki bahya jagat, kaal or kaarnon par apni nirbharta ko maanakar ham niyam pate hai
 " pehle maamle main dik main astitvaheen sthirataa ke bodh se inkaar karke us gati ko maananaa tha jiskaa ham bodh nahin karte; or is maamle main -- thik isi tarah astitvaheen swatantraaa se inkaar kar ke us adheenta ko sweekaar karne kii aavashyaktaa he jise ham mahasoos nahin karte

 The twenty-seventh pupil was named Vaidehi and told his story this way - Once King Vikramaditya was deeply asleep in his bedroom
 unhone ek sapana dekha
 There is a golden palace in which gems, rubies, etc
 are inlaid
 mahal main bade-bade kamare hai jinamein sajaavat kii alokik chize hai
 There are gardens around the palace and there are thousands of beautiful flowers in the garden
 un phulon par tarah-tarah kii titliyaan mandra rahi or bhanwaron kaa gunjan puure udyaan main vyaapt he
 The aroma of flowers is spread all around and the whole scene is very captivating
 svachh or sheethal hawa bah rahi he or mahal se kuch duuri par ek yogi sadhnarat he
 On seeing Yogi's face carefully, Vikram came to know about him
 yah sab dekhte-dekhte hi vikram kii ankhen khul gayi
 They understood that they had a good dream
 jagane ke baad bhi sapane main dikhi har chiz unhen spasht yaad thi
 He could not decode the meaning of his dream
 sara drishy alokik avashya tha, magar man kii upaj nahin mana ja saktaa tha
 The king thought a lot, but he could not remember that he had ever seen such a palace in his life, even if he had imagined such a palace
 unhone panditon or jyotishiyon se apane sapane kii charchaa kii or unhen isaki vyakhya karne ko kaha
 All scholars and scholars came to the conclusion that Maharajadhiraja had seen heaven in the dream and the supernatural palace of the dream is the palace of Indra, the king of heaven
 devtaa shaayad unhen vah mahal dikhaakar unhen sasharir swarg aane kaa nimantran de chuke he
 Vikram was very surprised to hear this
 unhone kabhi bhi na sochaa tha ki unhen swarg aane kaa is tarah nimantran milegaa
 They started asking the pundits what would be the path to heaven and what could be required for the journey to heaven
 kaaphi manthan ke baad saare vidwaanon ne unhen vah disha bataai jidhar se swargrohan ho saktaa tha tathaa unhen batalaaya ki koi puneatma jo satat bhagwaan kaa samaran karata he tathaa dharm ke path se vichlit nahin hota he vahi swarg jane kaa adhikari he
 The king said that if he did not deliberately to run the Rajpat, then he must have done some misogynist behavior
 iske alaava kabhi-kabhi rajya kii samasya main itane ulajh jate hai ki unhen bhagwaan kaa samaran nahin rahata he
 At this, everyone said with one voice that if they had not been qualified, they would not have seen heaven
 sabaki salaah par unhone raajpurohit ko apane saath liya or swarg kii yatra par nikal pade
 According to the statements of the Pandits, they were also required to perform two saintly works during the journey
 yah yatra lambi or kathin thi
 Vikram had renounced his royal disguise and was traveling in very ordinary clothes
 raste main ek nagar main raat main vishram ke liye ruk gaye
 Where he stayed, he found an old woman crying
 uske maathe par chintaa kii lakeeren ubhari hui thim tathaa galaa rote-rote rrundha ja rahaa tha
 When Vikram was moved and asked him the reason for his concern, he told that his only young son went to the forest in the morning, but has not returned yet
 vikram ne jaananaa chaha ki vah jangal kis prayojan se gaya
 The old woman told that her son goes to the forest in the morning to fetch dry wood and sells wood to the city
 lakadiyaan bechakar jo pasa miltaa he usee se unka guzaaraa hota he
 Vikram said that if he has not come yet, he will come
 budhi aurat ne kaha ki jangal bahut ghanaa he or narbhakshi jaanwaron se bharaa padaa he
 He suspects that some violent animal may not have made him his grass
 usne yah bhi bataaya ki shaam se vah bahut saare logon se vinati kar chuki he ki uske bete kaa pataa lagaae, lekin koi bhi jangal jane ko taiyaar nahin hua
 She shows her compulsion that she is old and weak, so she cannot go and find herself
 vikram ne use aashwaasan diya ki ve jaakar use dhundhenge
 He gave up the idea of relaxation and immediately started towards the forest
 thodi der baad unhone jangal main pravesh kiya to dekha ki jangal sachmuch bahut ghanaa ho
 When they came a little far from being alert, they saw a young man sitting on a tree with an ax and a lion ambush below
 vikram ne koi upaay dhundkar sher ko vahaan se bhaga diya or us yuvak ko lekar nagar laut aae
 Budhiya stopped mourning after seeing the son and gave a lot of blessings to Vikram
 is tarah budhiya ko chintamukt karke unhone ek punya kaa kaam kiya
 After resting overnight, he resumed his journey in the morning
 chalate-chalate ve samudr tat par aae to unhone ek sree ko rote hue dekha
 Seeing the woman crying, they came to her and saw that a cargo ship is standing and some people are loading the goods on that ship
 unhone us sree se uske rone kaa kaaran poocha to usne bataaya ki bas teen maheene pehle uski vivaah hua or vah garbhvatee he
 Her husband is an employee on this ship and is going to a far country with the ship's cargo
 vikram ne jab use kaha ki isame pareshaani kii koi baat nahin he or kuch hi samay baad uskaa pati laut aayega to usne apni chintaa kaa kaaran kuch or hi bataaya
 He said that he dreamed yesterday that a cargo ship gets engulfed in the middle of the sea and a terrible storm
 toofaan itnaa tej he ki jahaaj ke tukade-tukade ho jate he or us par saare savaar samudr main dub jate hai
 She is wondering what will happen to her if that dream comes true
 khud to kisi prakaar ji bhi legi magar uske hone vaale bachche kii parvarish kaise hogi
 Vikram felt pity for her and he gave her a conch provided by the sea god and said- “give this to your husband
 jab bhi tufaan yaa anya koi prakritik vipadaa aae to ise phunk degaa
 All his woes will be solved as soon as he blows
 " The woman could not believe him and started looking at him suspiciously
 vikram ne uske chehre kaa bhav padhakar shankh kii phunk maari
 The conch sounded and the sea water went away
 us pani ke saath vah jahaaj or us par ke saare karmchaaree bhi koson dur chale gaye
 Now the beach was not spread far and wide
 vah sree or kuch anya log jo vahaan the hairaan rah gaye
 their eyes were remained wide open
 jab vikram ne dubaara shankh phunkaa to samudr kaa pani phir se vahaan hiloden maarane laga
 That ship with sea water also returned, including crews
 ab yuvati ko us shankh kii chamatkaarik shakti ke prati koi shankaa nahin rahi
 He expressed his gratitude by taking the conch from Vikram
 vikram us sree ko shankh dekar apni yatra par nikal pade
 After walking some distance, he had to stay in one place
 akaash main kaali ghataaen chaa gayi thi
 Thunderbolts started striking
 badal ke garjan se samoochaa vaataavaran hilta prathit hota tha
 Amidst the glow of those electricity, Vikram saw a white horse coming down towards the ground
 vikram ne dhyaan se uski ore dekha tabhi akashwani hui- "maharaja Vikramaditya is hardly a saint like you
 tumne raste main do punya kiye
 An old woman was freed and gave a precious conch to a woman just to clear the doubt that Samudra Dev had given you a gift, pleased with your work
 tumhen lene ke liye ek ghoda bheja ja rahaa he jo tumhe indra ke mahal tak pahunchaa degaa
 " vikram ne kaha- "main akelaa nahin hoon
 i am accompanied by the chief priest as well
 unke liye bhi koi vyavastha ho
 " itnaa sunanaa tha ki raajpurohit ne kaha-"rajan, mujhe kshamaa karen
 i am afraid to go to heaven with my body

 Caste is the most basic and lower class in the biological classification of organisms
 jeevvaigyanik nazariye se aise jeevon ke samooh ko ek jati bulaayaa jaataa he jo ek dusre ke saath santan utpann karne kii kshamta rakhte ho or jinaki santan swayan aage santan janane kii kshamta rakhti ho
 For example, a wolf and a lion cannot bear children among themselves, so they are considered to be of different castes
 ek ghoda or gadhaa aapas main baccha paidaa kar sakate hai, lekin kyonki khachchar aage baccha janane main asamarth hote hai, isliye ghode or gadhe bhi alag jatiyon ke maane jate hai
 In contrast, dogs are found in very different sizes, but any male dog and female dog can have children that are capable of producing offspring themselves
 isliye sabhi kute, chaahe ve kisi nasal ke hi kyon na hon, jeevvaigyanik drushti se ek hi jati ke sadsy samajhe jate hai
 Different castes having similarities with each other, in which the biologists believe that they originated from the same ancestor in the past and have been divided into different branches over time through evolution, are put into the same biological lineage is
 masalan ghode, gadhe or zebra alag jatiyon ke hai lekin teenon ek hi 'ekwas' vansh ke sadsy maane jate hai
 The definition of castes in modern times is also done by examining other aspects
 udhaaharan ke liye anuvanshiki kaa prayog karke aksar jeevon kaa di en e parkhaa jaataa he or is aadhaar par un jeevon ko ek jati ghoshit kiya jaataa he jinaki di en e chhap ek duusare se milti ho or duusare jeevon se alag ho
 The definition used for the term "caste" and reliable methods of identifying caste are essential for biological tests and assessment of biodiversity
 prastaavit jatiyon ke kai udaahranon kaa adhyayan aksharon ko jod kar kiya janaa chahie isse pehle kii yah ek jati maan lee jaae
 yah aam taur par un vilupt jatiyon ke liye sankshipt vargeekrut shrenee he jisaki jaankaree keval jeevashm se hi praapt karnaa mumkin he
 Some zoologists may view statistical phenomena as opposed to the traditional idea of the class of species observed in animals
 aisi sthiti main kisi jati ko pruthak rup se shaamil vansh ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he jo ekal jin pool kisanrachana karata he
 However, definitions such as dna-sequence and morphology, used to help isolate lineages that are highly related to each other, have clear limitations
 haalanki, "jati" shabd kii sateek paribhaasha abhi bhi vivaadaaspad he, visheshkar jeevakosh ke sambandh main, or yah jati samasya kehalaati he
 Biologists have given more detailed definitions, but there are only a few options used that depend on the characteristics of the respective castes
 aamtaur par istemaal kiye jane vaale paudhe or pashuon ke naam ko taxa kabhi-kabhi in jatiyon ke samaan hote hai: jaise, "sher", "walras," or "kapur kaa ped" - prayek jatiyon ko darshaate hai
 Other cases in which those names are not used: "deer" refers to a class of 34 castes, including eld deer, red deer, and reindeer
 baad vaali do jatiyon ko kabhi yah vyakhya karte hue ek hi jati mana jaataa tha ki vaigyanik gyaan badhane ke saath-saath jatiyon kii simaaen kitni parivartit ho sakati hai
 Due to the difficulties in defining both the world and calculating their total number, it is estimated that anywhere between two and 100 million / 2 to 100 million of this type can be different species
 adarsh rup main, kisi jati ko ek aupchaarik rup se vaigyanik naam diya jaataa he, haalanki vyavhaar main aisi bahut si jatiyaan hai 
 kisi jati kaa naam tab rakhaa jaataa he, jab ise vansh-varg / vansh-kram main rakhaa jaataa he
 From the scientific point of view, it can be considered a hypothesis that castes are much more related to the genus of other castes than to other lineages
 ek saamaanya jatiyon main shaamil he or / iske rup main sabase acha gyaat vargeekaran shrenee hai: jivan, kshetra, rajya, jati, varg, kram, parivaar, vansh or jati
 jinas ko iskaa nirdhaaran karnaa aparivarty nahin; koi vargeekaran vaigyanik baad main main ise bhinn jinas de saktaa he jis kaaran uskaa naam bhi badal jayega
 In biological nomenclature, a caste name has two parts, they are considered Latin, although the name and place of any native language or the name of a person can be used for it
 jati naam pehle ke baad doosraa shabd, vishesh naam soochibaddh he
 For example, the species known as the long-leaf pine is the genus Pinus palustris, whose brown wolves belong to the Canis lumpus, the Coytes canis latrans, the golden fox canis orus, and they all belong to the genus Canis
 Not only in other words, but caste names are completely bipedal
 yah dwipadi namakaran parampara ko baad main namavali ke jaivik code main badalane kaa kaam sabase pehle liyonheart phuks dwaara prayog kiya gaya or maanak ke rup main kerolas lineyas dwaara 1753 main spasis plantaram main jari kiya gaya
 At that time the main biological principle was that the freely represented species were originated by God and hence they are considered to be real and immutable, so that the hypothesis of common ancestry is not applicable
 pustakon or lekh main / inke sankshipt naam / rakhe jate hai or iske sankshipt naam ek vachan main "sp
 " or bahuvachan main "spp
 " ko vishesh naam par rakhaa jaataa he: udhaaharan ke liye, kenis sp
 aisa aamtaur par nimnlikhit sthitiyon main hota he: In books and articles, the names of genus and castes are usually printed in italics
 "sp
" or "spp
" kaa upyog karke inhen itelic nahin karnaa chahie
 It is astonishingly difficult to explain the term "caste" which applies to all natural beings and to biologists about how to interpret castes and how to identify real castes is called the caste problem
 adhikansh pathyapustakon main kisi jati "vaastavik or sambhavit antar nasl prakritik aabaadi vaale samooh" jo aise anya samooh prajnan ke taur par alag rakhe jate hai
 Various parts of this definition, such as some unusual or artificial intercourse, are excluded from it: uparokt adarsh pathyapustak vaali paribhaasha bahu-koshikeey praaniyon ke liye acchhee tarah kaary karti he lekin aisi bhi kuch paristhitiyaan hai jahaan par inhen anupyukt tehraaya ja saktaa he: Horizontal gene transfer makes the term "race" even more complicated to define
 prokerat samooh ke asmaan samoohon or or kam se kam aksar eukerets ke asmaan samoohon ke bich kshaitijiy jin sthanantaran ke majboot sakshya hai or williamson kaa tark he ki crustaciuns or ekinoderm main iske kuch sakshya uplabdh hai
 All definitions of the term "race" that all of their genes are derived from one or two parents are exactly the same as that animal, but basic gene transfer seems to be misconceived
 ek sabase badhiya prashn yah he "jati" shabd jisaki vyakhya jeev vigyaani dete aae hai or is charchaa ko jatiyon kii samasya ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Darwin wrote in Chapter II of On the Origin of Species
 lekin baad main, darwin ne apni The Descent of Man main yah kehete hue apane mat main sanshodhan kiya ki "kya maanav main ek yaa anek jatiyaan shaamil hai"
 The modern theory of development rests on new fundamental definitions of "caste"
 darwin se pehle, prakrutivaadiyon ne jatiyon ko adarsh yaa saamaanya prakaar ke rup main dekha, jiskaa udhaaharan kisi adarsh namoonay ke saath diya ja saktaa he jisamen saamaanya jati ke samaan ve sabhi gun uplabdh hai
 The uniformity of Darwin's theory shifted attention from the simple to the special
 bauddhik itihaaskaar louis minand ke anusaar, It transforms "caste" into a new approach; Darwin vyaavhaarik rup se, jeev vigyaniyon ne jatiyon ko paribhaashit praaniyon kii aabaadi jinamein anuvanshik samanta kaa str ucch hota he ke rup main kii he
 It can reflect the adaptation of the same organism and transfer varieties of genetic material from one potential to another
 is prakaar kii paribhaasha main samanta ke sateek str kaa uprayog ekapaksheeya hota he, lekin yah praaniyon ke liye upyog kii jane vaali sabase aam paribhaasha he jisase alangik prajnan hota he, jiseki kuch paudhe or sookshm praani
 The lack of any apparent caste deficiency in microbiology has led some authors to argue that the use of the term "caste" is not correct when studying bacteria
 iske bajaay unhone jin ko dur-daraaj se sambandhit bacteria ko sambandhit bacteria ko sampurna bacteria sambandhi kshetra ko ek jin vaale pool ke saath swatantra rup se vichrate hue dekhte hai
 Nevertheless, the rule of thumb was established stating that more than 97% of the same 16S rrna gene sequence bacteria or Archaea should be examined by DNA – DNA hybridization regardless of whether they belong to the same species
 is avadharana kaa adhyatan haal hi main yah kehete hue kiya gaya he ki 97% kii seemaa bhi bahut kam thi or use 98
7% tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Sexually borne organisms, where the genetic material is shared in the reproductive process, then the interbreeding process of the two animals and the hybrid offspring of both sexes are accepted as equal indicators that the animals have shared the same species
 Has adopted abundant genes as a member of
 ek prakaar se "jati" antar prajnan praaniyon kaa ek samooh he
 This definition can be extended further by stating that a caste is a group of animals capable of potentially interbreeding breeding - fish can be kept in the same species even if they live in different lakes because they Interracial breeding can occur if they have ever come in contact with each other
 On the other hand, there are many examples of three or more bizarre populations of whether animals with intercultural populations can breed interculturally in other types of populations, but on the other hand, these populations are not capable of interbreeding
 is prakaar se, yah vishay bahes yogya he ki ye aabaadiyaan ek yaa do alag-alag jatiyaan banaati hai
 There is no contradiction in that species are defined based on gene frequencies and thus have ambiguous boundaries
 natijatan, "jati" kii saarvbhaumik paribhaasha aavashyak rup se ekapaksheeya he
 Instead, biologists have given many definitions; The use of which is the perfect choice for any zoologist depends on the characteristics of that zoologist's research
 abhyaas main, ye paribhaashaayen samaan hai or unke bich ekamusth virodhabhas kii tulana main unka maamla adhik mahatvapurn he
 Nevertheless, none of the concepts of caste proposed so far are fully objective or can apply in all cases without assistance for a decision
 jivan kii jatilta ko dekhte hue, kuch kaa kahana he ki is tarah ke ek uddeshy kii paribhaasha sabhi prakaar kii sambhaavnaaon main asambhav he or jeev vaigyanikon ko sabase adhik vyaavhaarik paribhaasha kaa nirdhaaran karnaa chahie
 It is the concept of all biological species in most spineless animals and is largely deficient in the phylogenetic race
 kai BSC up-jatiyon ko PSC ke antargat jati mana jaataa he; BSC or PSC ke bich antar kaa nirdhaaran kiya ja saktaa he kyonki BSC jati ko spasht vikasvaadi itihaas ke parinamswaroop jati ko paribhaashit karata he, jabaki PSC kisi jati ko spasht vikasvaadi sambhaavna ke parinamswaroop paribhaashit karata he
 In this way, the PSC castes were "created" as soon as the evolutionary lineage began to be separated, while the BSC caste began to emerge only when their lineage separation was complete
 tadnusaar, PSC banaam BSC ke aadhaar par vaikalpik vargeekaran ke bich paryaapt vivaad sambhav he kyonki unke taxa ke vyavhaar ke aadhaar par ve bilkul bhinn hai, use baad vaale model ke antargat up-jatiyaan maanya hongi
 Life-supporting castes: Many castes are absolutely bizarre towards adaptation to the environment, as they are capable of yielding or breeding under certain conditions such as drought, desertification, flooding, soil poisoning, soil salinity, many of which are food
 , Providing materials and empowering humans, livestock and other animals are considered potentially beneficial to humans A
 These are known as life-supporting nations
 jiseki unamem parsparik mukhya jatiyaan shaamil hai kyonki inke paas bhu-akritiyon kii akhandta kii mukhya kunjee hoti he jisamen donon praaniyon ke biodeta or maanav samudaay shaamil hai
 Both ecological and socioeconomic castes are tributaries for life
 jatiyon ke vargeekaran ke saath purvollekhith samasyaon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue nimnlikhit sankhya keval naam maatr kaa maargdarshan he
 In 2007, they were as follows: jatiyon kii kul sankhya : 7-100 million sahit: Among the Eukaryte castes, we could only identify them: vartmaan main, global texonomi inishiative, european distributed institute of texonomi or censos of marine life texonomi sudhaar kaa prayaas kar rahe hai or pehle se agyaat jatiyon ko texonomi system ko amal main laa rahe hai
 Due to the fact that we know only a few creatures in the living room, yet we do not have full understanding of the functioning of our environment
 professor james melette ke anusaar ham nai jatiyon kii khoj ke baavjood maamalon ko bad se badtar banaate ja rahe hai or ham in jatiyon ko abhootpurv gati ke saath samaapt karte ja rahe hai
 It also means that it must be studied and classified before acquiring a new race, since it may have already become extinct
 jatiyon kii dharna kaa lanbaa itihaas he
 This is one of the most important levels of classification for several reasons: varshon ke prayog ke baad, jeev vigyaan kii avadharana or sambandhit kshetra ke mejabaan ke rup main pramukh rahi he lekin abhi tak ise purna rup se paribhaashit nahin kii gai he
 The nomenclature of a particular caste should be considered hypotheses about the evolutionary relationship and diversity of the organisms of that group
 agrim jaankaree haath main aate hi pariklpana kii pushti yaa uskaa khandan kiya ja saktaa he
 Sometimes, especially when communication was much more difficult in the past, classification scientists working on segregation gave different names to different animals that were later identified as a common race
 jab do naam vaali jati kii khoj ek jati ke rup main kii gai, to puraani jati kaa naam aamtaur se kaayam rakhaa gaya or nai jati ke naam ko vah naam de diya gaya, ek aisi prakriya jo ekatrikaran ke rup main paryaayavacheekaran yaa bolchaal kii prakriya kehalaati he
 The division of a texon into more than one is usually called a texon
 vargeekaran vaigyanikon ko aamtaur se unke sahpaathiyon dwaara unhen "lanpar" yaa "splitre" kaha jaataa he, jo jantuon ke bich pahachaane jane vaale antar par unke vyaktigat drushtikon or samaantaaon par nirbhar karata he
 Traditionally, researchers have relied on the observation of structural differences and the observation of whether or not their differential reproduction was successfully carried out for differences in castes in different populations; Both anatomy and reproductive behavior are still important to state the status of castes
 pichley kuch dashakon main, sookshmjeevigyaani anusandhan takanic main kranti ke parinamswaroop jaise DNA vishleshan se jatiyon ke bich antar or samaantaaon ke bare main athaah gyaan uplabdh ho gaya he
 Many populations formerly considered as separate castes are now considered a taxon and the pre-grouped population is divided
 koi vargeekaran str kaa paryaayavacheekaran yaa vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he or ucch texonomik str par ye sanshodhan abhi bhi bahut athaah hai
 From the classification point of view, groups in race can be defined more as Texon classification than race
 praanivigyaan main keval up-jatiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jabaki vanaspati vigyaan main vividhta, up-vividhta or swaroop kaa upyog kiya gaya he
 In conservation biology, the evolutionary critical unit is used that can be defined as a segment with a caste or more small bizarre population
 vigyaan ke praarambhik kaary main, jati keval alag-alag praani hote the jo apane samaan yaa lagbhag samaan praaniyon ke samooh kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 At that time no other relations were applicable to them
 arestu ne jinas or jati shabd kaa upyog jatigat yaa vishesh virgon ke liye kiya
 Aristotle and other pre-darwinian scientists considered castes to be special and immutable as chemical elements such as "essence"
 When the early observers began to develop the organization as a system for organisms, they began to place the segregated space beforehand
 inamen se kai praarambhik chithran yojanaon ko ab sanakee nahin mana jayega or inamen samarktata ke aadhaar par rang yaa vyavhaar shaamil hai
 In the 18th century, Swedish scientist Carolus Linnaeus classified organisms according to reproductive organs
 haalanki jeevon ke vargeekaran ke unke prakaar ne samanta ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya, lekin unhone samaan jatiyon ke bich sambandh ke bare main koi daawa nahin kiya
 
 At that time, it was still widely believed that no one among the castes believed that there was any biological connection between the biological castes, no matter how similar they looked
 This approach also suggested a kind of idealism: the notion that all the existing castes are an "ideal form"
 haalanki vahaan par sabhi jeevon ke bich hameshaa hi matbhed hai, to bhi linius ne aise antar ko samasyapurna mana
 unhone alag-alag jeevon kii pahchaan karne kaa prayaas kiya jo jatiyon kaa anukaraniya tha or anya gaiyr-anukaraniya jeevon asaamaanya or apurna mana
 By the 19th century most naturalists understood that caste could change from time to time, and that the history of the home gave enough time for major changes in them
 jin-baptist lamark ne Zoological Philosophy main sristi-rachana-siddhant ke viruddh pehla taarkik vichaar diya
 There was a new preference for determining how castes might change over time
 lamark ne suzav diya ki jeev kisi praapt gun ko apane aane vaale vansh main pahunchaa saktaa he jaise jiraph kii lambii gardan oonche pedo kii pattiyon tak pahunchnaa jiraph kii peedi kaa gun tha
 However, with Charles Darwin's acceptance of the natural selection idea in 1860, Lanmark's approach to goal-oriented development, also known as the teleological process, was rendered ineffective
 pashchjanan sambandhi prakriyaayein jaise mithailation ke aas-paas praapt visheshtaon ke vanshanukram main haal hi kii ruchi jo DNA kram ko prabhavit nahin karti, lekin viraasatiya tareeke se abhivyakti ko badla ja saktaa he
 Thus, neo-lamarckism, as it has sometimes been talked about, that the theory of evolution is not a challenge with natural selection
 charles darwin or alfred veles vah vichaar diya jiskaa paalan aaj bhi vaigyanik vikaas ke siddhant kaa sabase shaktishaalee or sammohak rup main karte hai
 Darwin argued that this included population was not just a creature
 unka tark linius kii kattarpanthi dhara ke pariprekshya kii tulana main adhik vishwasaneey he:jati kii vyakhya adarsh shabd ke rup main karne kii bajaay, darwin ne jeevon ke bich antar ko prakritik mana
 unhone aage tark diya ki samasyagrastata se dur durlabh jati ke astitv ke liye vastav main uskaa spashtikaran kiya
 Darwin's work drew on Thomas Malthus' insight that the growth rate of organic populations would always be ahead of the growth rate of resources in the environment, such as the supply of food
 As a result, Darwin argued that not all organisms in the population would be able to subsist and breed
 unke dwaara kiye jane vaale kaary ausatan lekin unamem antar hoga - haalanki ve use thodaa bahut paryaavaran ke anukool banaaenge
 agar ye gunon vaale antar paitruk rahe to jivit rahane waalon kaa vansh unhen dhaaran kar legaa
 In this way, adaptive variations will accumulate in the population over many generations, while the hostile traits will disappear
 is baat par bal diya janaa chahie ki kya paryaavaran main koi antar anukuli he yaa gaiyr anukuli: bhinn-bhinn paryaavaran alag alag gunon kaa paksh lete hai
 Because the environment effectively chooses which creature to survive for reproduction and it is the environment that determines which qualities should go forward
 yah prakritik chayan ke dwaara vikaas kaa siddhant he
 In this model, the neck length of a giraffe would be interpreted according to the situation that the long-necked proto-giraffe acquired special reproductive traits from the short-necked giraffe
 For many generations, the entire population would have belonged to long-necked animals
 
 1859 main, jab darwin ne prakritik chayan kaa apana siddhant prakashit kiya, to us samay vanshanukram ke vyaktigat gunon vaale tantra kaa gyaan nahin tha
 Although Darwin made some assumptions about inheritance of virtue, his theory was based only on the fact that inheritance properties exist and are mutable
 haalanki grager mendal anuvanshiki par shodh-patr ko uski visheshtaon kii pahchaan kiye bina hi 1866 main prakashit kiya gaya tha
 This was not done until 1900 when his work was rediscovered by Hugo de Verais, Carl Correns, and Erick von Semark, when they realized that Darwin's theory had "inherited properties" genes
 prakritik chayan ke madhyam se vikaas kii jatiyon ke vargeekaran main jatiyon kii charchaa ke liye do mahatvapurn manyataayen he - ve parinaam lineyas kii texonomi ke paksh main anumaanon ko moolbhoot rup se chunauti detii hai
 At first it showed that castes are not only the same but they can also be really related
 darwin ke kuch chaatro kaa tark he ki sabhi jatiyaan aam purvaj kii vanshaj hai
 Second, it is assumed that "caste" is not homogeneous, stable, permanent things; Caste members are completely different and castes have changed a long time ago
 is baat se pataa chalata he ki jatiyon kii koi vishesh seemaa kshetra nahin he lekin lagaataar badalati jin-aavritiyon ke sankhyikeey prabhaav padate hai
 Still, one can use the classification of Linnaeus to identify plants and animals, but no one can think of an independent and immutable form of castes anymore
 paitruk vansh se kisi nai jati main vikaas hona speshiation kehalaata he
 The progeny caste has no clear lineage demarcation from its descendant caste
 haalanki jatiyon ke vartmaan vaigyanik gyaan se yah pataa chalaa he ki sabhi maamalon main vibhinn jatiyon ke bich antar sthapit karne ke liye koi thos or vyapak tarika nahin he, taaki jeev vigyaani is vichaar ke sanchaalan ko jari rakhane ke liye thos tareekon kii talash jari rakhen
 jati ke bare main sabase lokapriy jaivik paribhaasha main se ek prajnan algaav ke sandarbh main he, agar do praani donon lingon ke sankar vansh kaa prajnan karne main sakasham nahin hote, to ve bhinn-bhinn jatiyon ke hote hai
 Intuitive castes have limitations in this definition, but are incomplete
 udhaaharan ke liye un jati ke bare main kuch nahin kahana he jo alangik tareeke se prajnan karte hai or use vilupt hoti ja raheen jatiyon par lagu karnaa bada mushkil he
 In addition, the boundaries between castes are often unclear: there are instances where members of a particular population breed fertile hybrid offspring of creatures from a second population and members of a second population cultivate fertile hybrids from creatures with a third population
 Can breed offspring but members of the first and third populations cannot breed fertile hybrids or only fertile offspring from parents Birth is possible
 natijatan, kuch log jati kii is paribhaasha ko asweekaar karte hai
 Richard Dakins describes the two organisms as homogeneous and if they have the same number of chromosomes and for each chromosome, both creatures have the same number of chromosomes
 However, most all classification scientists will disagree with this point
 udhaaharan ke liye, kai ubhaycharon main, vishesh rup se newjiland main, leopelma mendhakon ke jinom main "mul" jinom hote hai jo bilkul bhinn nahin hote or gaun gunasutra hote hai jo bahut se sanyojanon main maujuud hai
 Although extreme differences are found in the number of chromosomes of the population, they can successfully differentiate and form a single developmental unit
 paudhon main, poliflidi antar prajnan par kuch rokthaamon vaala atyadhik saamaanya sthaan he; kyonki praaniyon ke gunasutron ke set sam sankhya se visankramit kiye jate hai, jo vartmaan gunasutron ke set kii vaastavik sankhya par nirbhar karata he jahaan vahi vikaskaari ikai ke kuch praani kuch anya ke saath antar prajnan kar sakate hai or kuch nahin or usamen puri aabaadi ko visheshtaur se ek saamaanya jin pool banane ke rup main joda gaya he
 Classification of species is particularly affected by technological advances that allowed researchers to link their evidence based on molecular traces, to acute evidence of crude blood plasma, in the mid-20th century ground-breaking DNA-DNA hybridization study of Charles Sibley, In 1970, the comparison gave rise to DNA sequencing techniques
 in takneekon ke parinamswaroop ucch texonomik virgon main krantikari parivartan aayaa, jisase filogenetic ped kii bahut si shakhaon kii punarvyavastha vaale parinaam praapt hue

 The turtle was determined to develop at the molecular level with only one-eighth of the speed of other reptiles, and the rate of molecular evolution in albatross is found to be only half that of storum-petrels
 aajkal aprachlit sankaran takanic uplabdh he or anukram kii tulana ke liye or adhik vishwasaneey computesnal drushtikon dwaara badali jaati he
 Molecular taxonomy is not directly based on evolutionary processes, but overall changes are made by these processes
 ve prakriyaayein jo peedi or vividhta vaale rakrakhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karti hai jaise parivartan, badlaav kii prakriya or chayan samroop nahin hai
 DNA is only the rarer direct target of natural selection rather than a change in DNA sequence during generations on the latter outcome; For example, the silent transit-substitution combination would alter the melting point of the DNA sequence, but not the sequence of the encoded protein, and for example where for microorganisms, the changes in themselves consider changes in their fitness
 allopasia arita, jisko spot baldnes ek autoimmune rog handi jisame sar ke kuch yaa sampurna hisse se bal jhad jate hai
 In this, hair mostly falls from the skin of the head because in it the body stops recognizing itself and destroys its own tissues, as if it is an invader

 Such spectrum is called band spectrum
 yadi padaarth ko bahut adhik urja di jaae to anu tut jate hai or padaarth ke parmaanu uttejit ho jate hai
 In the spectrum obtained from excited atoms, lines of different characters are found
 yah spectrum band spectrum se sarvatha bhinn hota he
 The band spectrum is obtained from molecules
 at: ise 'aanvik spectrum' bhi kehete hai
 In such a spectrum, one edge of each band or band is more visible
 is kinare ko band sheersh kehete hai
 Beyond the band head, the intensity of the stripe decreases gradually and often the top of the next band falls before the second edge is formed, or the intensity of this band is reduced to zero
 yadi prakharata ghatane kaa kram deergh tarang se laghu tarang kii ore hota he, to band ko bangnee avakramit or yadi yah kram laghu se deergh tarang kii ore hota he, to band ko laal avakramit kehete hai
 It is known from a good spectroscope that each band is a gradual community of many microscopic lines
 sheersh kii ore ye rekhaayen atyadhik saghan hoti jaati hai or punch kii ore kramash: viral hoti jaati hai
 The band spectrum is mainly of two types, absorption spectrum and emission spectrum
 padaarth ke vaashp ko uchit taap or daab par kisi nalee main band kar diya jaae or usamen se aviral rashmiyaan bheji jaaen, to vaashp dwaara kuch rashmiyaan avashoshit ho jaati hai
 The vapor of a substance, which can emit at very high temperatures, absorbs only those at low temperatures
 at: nalee se baahar aanevaali rashmiyon ke aviral spectrum main kaale kaale band paae jate hai
 Such spectrum is called absorption spectrum
 bahut si gaison main kam daab par vidyutdvisarjan karaane se bhi band spectrum praapt hota he
 These are called emission spectrums

 Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in Mon Repos on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921, the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg
 Philip's four elder sisters were Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, and Sophie
 He was baptised into the Greek Orthodox Church
 His godparents were Queen Olga of Greece and the Mayor of Corfu
 Shortly after Philip's birth, his maternal grandfather, Prince Louis of Battenberg, then known as Louis Mountbatten, Marquess of Milford Haven, died in London
 Louis was a naturalized British citizen, who, after a career in the Royal Navy, had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten during the First World War
 After visiting London for the memorial, Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the greco-turkish War
 The war went badly for Greece, and the Turks made large gains
 On 22 September 1922, Philip's uncle, King Constantine I, was forced to abdicate, and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others
 The commander of the army, General Georgios Hatzianestis, and five senior politicians were executed
 Prince Andrew's life was believed to be in danger, and Alice was under surveillance
 In December, a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life
 The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Prince Andrew's family, with Philip being carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box
 Philip's family went to France, where they settled in the Paris suburb of saint-cloud in a house lent to them by his aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark
 Because he left the country as a baby, he does not have a strong grasp of Greek
 In 1992 Philip said that he "could understand a certain amount of" the language
 Philip was first educated at an American school in Paris run by Donald macjannet, who described Philip as a "rugged, boisterous 


 but always remarkably polite" boy
 In 1928, he was sent to Britain to attend Cheam School, living with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle, George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire
 In the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was placed in an asylum after being diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his father moved to a small flat in Monte Carlo
 Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood
 In 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, which had the "advantage of saving school fees" because it was owned by the family of his brother-in-law, Berthold, Margrave of Baden
 With the rise of Nazism in Germany, Salem's Jewish founder, Kurt Hahn, fled persecution and founded Gordonstoun school in Scotland
 After two terms at Salem, Philip moved to Gordonstoun
 In 1937, his sister Cecilie, her husband, her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 After leaving Gordonstoun in 1939, Prince Philip joined the Royal Navy, graduating the next year from the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, as the best cadet in his course
 During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christopher of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side
 He was commissioned as a midshipman in January 1940
 Philip spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies, protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent, on HMS Shropshire and in Ceylon
 After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet
 Among other engagements, Philip was involved in the Battle of Crete, and was mentioned in despatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which he controlled the battleship's searchlights
 He was also awarded the Greek War Cross of Valour
 Duties of lesser glory included stoking the boilers of the troop transport ship RMS Empress of Russia
 He was promoted to sub-lieutenant after a series of courses at Portsmouth in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination
 In June 1942, he was appointed to the v and w class destroyer and flotilla leader, HMS Wallace, which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain, as well as the allied invasion of Sicily
 Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942
 In October of the same year he became the first lieutenant of HMS Wallace, at 21 years old one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy
 During the invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, as second in command of HMS Wallace, he saved his ship from a night bomber attack
 He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed
 In 1944, he moved on to the new destroyer, HMS Whelp, where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla
 He was present in Tokyo Bay when the instrument of Japanese surrender was signed
 In January 1946, Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the Whelp, and was posted as an instructor at HMS Royal Arthur, the Petty Officers' School in Corsham, Wiltshire
 In 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth
 During the visit, the Queen and Earl Mountbatten asked Philip to escort the King's two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, who were Philip's third cousins through Queen Victoria, and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark
 Elizabeth fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters when she was thirteen
 Eventually, in the summer of 1946, Philip asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage
 The King granted his request, provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth's twenty-first birthday the following April
 By March 1947, Philip had abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles, had adopted the surname Mountbatten from his mother's family, and had become a naturalised British subject
 The engagement was announced to the public on 10 July 1947
 Though Philip appeared "always to have regarded himself as an Anglican", and had attended Anglican services with his classmates and relations in England, and throughout his Royal Navy days, Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher wanted to "regularise" Philip's position by officially receiving him into the Church of England, which he did in October 1947
 The day preceding his wedding, King George VI bestowed the style His Royal Highness on Philip and, on the morning of the wedding, 20 November 1947, he was made the Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich of Greenwich in the County of London
 Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey, recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world
 However, in post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for any of the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations to be invited to the wedding, including Philip's three surviving sisters, all of whom had married German princes, some of them with Nazi connections
 After their marriage, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh took up residence at Clarence House
 His first two children were born: Prince Charles in 1948 and Princess Anne in 1950
 Philip returned to the navy after his honeymoon, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty, and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich
 From 1949, he was stationed in Malta after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Chequers, the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet
 On 16 July 1950, he was promoted lieutenant commander and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie
 He was promoted to commander in 1952, but his active naval career ended in July 1951
 With the King in ill health, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were both appointed to the Privy Council on 4 November 1951, after a coast-to-coast tour of Canada
 At the end of January 1952, Philip and his wife set out on a tour of the Commonwealth
 On 6 February 1952, when they were in Kenya, Elizabeth's father died and she became queen
 It was Philip who broke the news of her father's death to Elizabeth at Sagana Lodge, and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom
 The accession of Elizabeth to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house
 The Duke's uncle, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, advocated the name House of Mountbatten, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; however, when Queen Mary, Elizabeth's paternal grandmother, heard of this suggestion, she informed the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who himself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor
 Churchill's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten, whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India, may have contributed to this
 The Duke privately complained, "I am nothing but a bloody amoeba
 i am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children
" On 8 February 1960, several years after the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill, the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that the surname of male-line descendants of the Duke and the Queen who are not styled as Royal Highness, or titled as Prince or Princess, was to be mountbatten-windsor
 While it seems the Queen had "absolutely set her heart" on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only eleven days before the birth of Prince Andrew, and only after three months of protracted correspondence between the constitutional expert Edward Iwi and the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
 After her accession to the throne, the Queen also announced that the Duke was to have "place, pre-eminence and precedence" next to her "on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament"
 This meant the Duke took precedence over his son, the Prince of Wales, except, officially, in the British parliament
 In fact, however, he attends Parliament only when escorting the Queen for the annual State Opening of Parliament, where he walks and sits beside her
 Contrary to rumors over the years, the Queen and Duke are said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage, despite the challenges of Elizabeth's reign
 The Queen referred to Prince Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her "constant strength and guide"
 During his wife's Golden Jubilee in 2002, the Duke was commended by the Speaker of the British House of Commons for his role in supporting the Queen during her reign
 The Duke of Edinburgh's time as royal consort exceeds that of any other consort in British history; however, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who died aged 101, was the consort with the longest lifespan
 In April 2008, Philip was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital for "assessment and treatment" for a chest infection, though he walked into the hospital unaided and recovered quickly, and was discharged three days later to recuperate at Windsor Castle
 In August, the Evening Standard reported that he was suffering from prostate cancer
 Buckingham Palace, which usually refuses to comment on rumors of ill health, claimed that the report was an invasion of privacy and issued a statement denying the story
 The newspaper retracted the report and admitted it was untrue
 In June 2011, in an interview marking his 90th birthday he said that he would now slow down and reduce his duties, stating that he had "done bit"
 His wife, the Queen, gave him the title Lord High Admiral for his 90th birthday
 While staying at the royal residence at Sandringham, Norfolk, on 23 December 2011, the Duke suffered chest pains and was taken to the cardio-thoracic unit at Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he underwent successful coronary angioplasty and stenting
 He was discharged on 27 December
 On 4 June 2012, during the celebrations in honor of his wife's Diamond Jubilee, Philip was taken from Windsor Castle to the King Edward VII Hospital, London, suffering from a bladder infection
 He was released from hospital on 9 June
 After a recurrence of infection in August 2012, while staying at Balmoral Castle, he was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for five nights as a precautionary measure
 In June 2013, Philip was admitted to the London Clinic for an exploratory operation on his abdomen, spending 11 days in hospital
 On 21 May 2014, the Prince appeared in public with a bandage on his right hand after a "minor procedure" was performed in Buckingham Palace the preceding day
 He is the longest-lived male member of the British royal family
 The record for the longest-lived male descendant of Queen Victoria is currently held by Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg who lived to be 95 years, 6 months and 5 days old
 Prince Philip would surpass this record on 15 December 2016
 Philip played polo until 1971, when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped expand; the early rule book was drafted under his supervision
 He was a keen yachts sailor, striking up a friendship in 1949 with Uffa Fox in Cowes
 He and the Queen regularly attended Cowes Week in HMY Britannia
 His first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952; by his 70th birthday he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours
 He was presented with Royal Air Force wings in 1953
 In April 2014, it was reported that an old British Pathe newsreel film had been discovered of Philip's 1962 two-month flying tour of South America
 Filmed sitting alongside Philip at the aircraft's controls was his co-pilot Peter Middleton, the grandfather of the Duke's granddaughter-in-law, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge
 He has painted with oils, and collected artworks, including contemporary cartoons, which hang at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and Balmoral Castle
 Hugh Casson described Philip's own artwork as "exactly what you'd expect 


 totally direct, no hanging about
 Strong colours, vigorous brushstrokes
" In 1979, when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of US President Jimmy Carter, Prince Philip was approached by White House butler Lynwood Westray and another unnamed butler
 Westray asked him "your majesty, would you like a cordial?", And Prince Philip responded, "i'll take one if you'll let me serve you"
 "oh my God, this had never happened before," said Westray
 "there we were standing there
 i was holding the glasses and my buddy was holding the liqueurs and we looked at each other, and i said 'if that's the only way you'll have it, we'll go along with it
' And the prince served us what he was having, and the three of us had a drink and a conversation
 It was an honor to let him do it
 " Over his sixty years as royal consort, Philip has become famous for making remarks that were often construed as being offensive or stereotypical in nature
 Some of them were immediately interpreted as gaffes; but other awkward observations were construed by apologists as merely odd, off-colour, and often funny
 In his own words, comments attributed to Prince Philip have contributed to the perception that he is "a cantankerous old sod"
 The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of "HRH Victor Meldrew"
 For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, "no wonder you are deaf listening to this row
" Later Philip wrote, "the story is largely invention
 It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and i have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that i would do any such thing
" During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, "if you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed
" The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned
 Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go "round-eyed"
 His comment had no effect on sino-british relations, but it shaped his own reputation
 Philip has been a Freemason since 1953
 Philip has held a number of titles throughout his life
 Originally holding the title and style of a prince of Greece and Denmark, Philip abandoned these royal titles prior to his marriage, and was thereafter created a British duke, among other noble titles
 It was not, however, until the Queen issued Letters Patent in 1957 that Philip was again titled as a prince
 When addressing the Duke of Edinburgh, as with any male member of the royal family except the monarch, the rules of etiquette are to address him the first time as Your Royal Highness, and thereafter as Sir
 The Duke of Edinburgh was appointed by King George VI to the Order of the Garter on 19 November 1947, the eve of his wedding
 Since then, Philip has received 17 different appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth, and 48 from foreign states
 The inhabitants of some villages on the island of Tanna, Vanuatu also worship Prince Philip as a god; the islanders possess portraits of the Duke and hold feasts on his birthday
 Upon his wife's accession to the throne in 1952, the Duke was appointed Admiral of the Sea Cadet Corps, colonel-in-chief of the British Army Cadet Force, and Air commodore-in-chief of the Air Training Corps
 The following year, he was appointed to the equivalent positions in Canada, and made Admiral of the Fleet, Captain General Royal Marines, Field Marshal, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom
 Subsequent military appointments were made in New Zealand and Australia
 To celebrate his 90th birthday, the Queen appointed him Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy and Canada appointed him to the highest ranks available in all three branches of the Canadian Armed Forces
