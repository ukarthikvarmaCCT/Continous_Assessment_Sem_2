 The emergence of the Greek alphabet centuries after the fall of the Mycenaean civilization and after the disuse of the earlier Greek writing system, the Linear b script, in the eighth century BC
 Happened in the middle of rekhiy bi kaa udbhav rekhiy e se hua jo ki minoai sabhyataa dwaara viksit thi, jinaki bhashaa unani se sambandhit nahin thi, parinamswaroop minoai aksharmala unani bhashaa kii dhvaniyon ke lipyantaran hetu adarsh madhyam uplabdh nahin karaatin
 The Greek alphabet prevailing today developed after the Greek dark period, that is, the decline of the Mycenaean civilization and the rise of ancient Greece, which was about 800 BC
 It was the time between the epics of Homer and the beginning of the ancient Olympic Games in 776 BC

 Vowel signs were not originally used in the Semitic alphabet
 purvavarti pashchimi simitic lipi parivaar main, ek avishisht swar ke saath vyanjan hetu ek akshar hameshaa prayukt kiya gaya
 This did not reduce readability as the word in semitic languages is based on triaxial roots that explain meaning only by the presence of consonants and vowels are clarified by context
 vipareet, unani ek bhaaropee bhashaa he atah swar main antar arth main bada antar paidaa karata he
 Therefore, the Greek alphabet divided the letters into two categories - vowels and consonants, where a consonant must be used with a vowel to become an accentable unit

 In Eastern Greek, which lacked complete pronunciation, the semitic glottal consonant / ħ / ka h) was also used for long vowels / ɛː / and finally Ω) The letter began to be used for long / ɔː / 
 The reason for the inclusion of long open letters e and o lies in oral morphological study of the language

 Greek also included three new consonant letters Φ), Χ) and Ψ) which are given at the end of the alphabet according to their development

 In Western Greek, x was used for / ks / and ψ was used for / kh / - so the Latin letter x is derived from the Western Greek alphabet

 At the end of the word, similar to the Latin long and heart s, σ was written similarly ς

 Policemen are very strict with him so that he can tell the truth, but Jamal is adamant that he did not cheat
 The film's story goes into Jamal's premonition and the audience automatically gets a one-question answer

 In those parts of Jamal's life, Amitabh's signature is taken, his mother killed during the hindu-muslim riots in the slum, his friendship with an orphan girl named Latika
 Jamal goes to school briefly and names his brother Athos, his name Parthose, and Latika's third Musketeers on the three characters in his beloved book, The Three Musketeers

 After knowing the truth, the policemen again allow him to go on the show

 When Jamal uses the phone option of a friend for his last question, the phone picks up, but the answer to his question is not known

 He names the third musketeers as Armij and wins a show of two crores

 yah mukhyat: ganit, vigyaan evam system sambandhit kaaryo ke kaam aati he
 Only lower case letters are used when giving instructions in this language
 uparokt visheshtao ke kaaran hi ’si’ ek atyadhik lokapriy computer programing bhashaa he
 Before that we have come to know how any variable is preserved in the computer's memory
 jahaan yah char sangrakshit hota he uskaa ek nishchit pataa bhi hota he jo yah bataata he ki char kaa maan memory main kahan sangrakshit he
 This address is called pointer
 c / C++ programmen bhashaa main yah suvidha bhi hoti he ki kisi char kaa pataa gyaat kiya ja saken 
 In c / c ++ programming languages also use & to find out the variable
 jaise ki agar koi purnank char x he to x kaa pataa &x se mil jaayegaa
 Just as integers, letters, real numbers, etc
 are preserved in the variable, so does the leaf of a variable
 iske liye ek nayaa datatip hota he jo pataa sangrakshit karne ke kaam aata he jis tarah se purnank sangrakshit karne ke liye int datatype kaa upyog hota he
 Use the int * datatype to preserve the address of an integer variable
 isi tarah akshar char kaa pataa sangrakshit karne ke liye char* datatype kaa upyog karte hai
 a small example is given below in which one variable preserves the address of another variable
 yahan pehle ek purnank char x paribhaashit kiya gaya he, phir p aisa char paribhaashit kiya he jo kisi purnank kaa pataa sangrakshit karata he
 Then put the address of x in the p variable
 pataa → 0 1 2 3 4memory → 1 xxrep 4 0 111 11100101 00100110 xxrep 4 0 101 01100101 
 
 
 ↑ p = &x = 3 int x ab char ek purnank pointer p he jisamen char x kaa pataa sangrakshit he arthath p ko likhavane par x kaa pataa likhaa jaayegaa
 If we want to know what memory is written in p on that memory, then we must write a main function to use * p
 kyonki ’si’ compiler kisi bhi program ko nishpadit karnaa main function se aarambh karata he
 a file or a program cannot have more than one main function
 yah ek prayogkarta dwaara paribhaashit function he
 The main function is initialized by brackets '{'
 program sanchika ke nishpaadan ke samay ’{’ yah bataata he ki nishpaadan yahan se aarambh karnaa he
 Similarly '}' tells that execution is to end here
 ek program main main function to ek hi rahata he parantu anya function kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 a subprogram is given between {and} for each function
 prayek nirdesh kaa ant semikalan ’;’ dwaara hona aavashyak he

 film nirmaan ek praarambhik story idia yaa kamishan se, patakatha lekhan, shooting, sampadan, nirdesan evam darshakon tak uske vitaran ke madhyam se film nirmaan kii ek prakriya he
 Usually, a large number of people are involved in it and it takes a few months to a few years to complete
 film nirmaan kaa kaary duniya bhar main aarthik, saamaajik or raajnneetik sandarbhon kii ek vishaal shrenee main sabhi jagah ghatit hota he or isamen praudyogiki or takanic kii vibhinn kismon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Filmmaking takes place in five stages: is charan main, is pariyojna kaa nirmaataa ek kahani khojataa he jo kisi kitaab, naatak, anya film, satya-katha, moulik idia se mil sakati he
 After identifying the original subject or underlining its messages, the producer works with the author to summarize the story
 iske baad ve ek step outline taiyaar karte hai, jo puri kahani ko ek-anuchhed ke drishyon main vibhajit kar detaa he jiskaa puraa dhyaan naatakeey sanrachana par hota he
 Then, they prepare a 25–30 page treatise on the story and its mood and characters
 isamen aamtaur par chota samvaad or manch nirdesan hota he, lekin isamen praaia: chitra bhi shaamil rahete hai jo mul vinduon ko disha dene main madad karte hai
 Another way to present a scripment is to prepare syrup
 iske baad, patakatha lekhak kai maheenon se adhik kaa samay lekar patakatha likhata he
 The screenwriter may rewrite it several times to improve the dramatic adaptation, clarity, structure, characters, dialogue and overall style
 haalanki, nirmaataa aksar pichley charnon ko chhod dete hai or prastut patakatha kaa vikaas karte hai jise niveshak, studio or anya icchhuk partiyaan ek prakriya dwaara aankati hai jise patakatha kawarej kaha jaataa he
 The film distributor may be approached at an early stage to review the potential market and the potential financial success of the film
 hollywood vitarak kathor vyapaarik drushtikon ko apanaate hai or film vidha, lakshya shrota, samaan filmon kii aitihaasik safalataa, abhinayta jo film main aa sakate hai or sambhavit nirdeshkon jaise tatwon par vichaar karte hai
 All these elements inform the potential audience and thus a definite appeal to the number of "ais" during theatrical performances
 sabhi filmein keval cinemagharon main relies se laabh nahin kamaatin, isliye film companiyaan dividi bikri or duniya bhar main uske vitaran kaa adhikaar le leti hai
 Producers and screenwriters prepare a film pitch or treatment and present it to potential investors
 yadi pich safal hota he to film "green lite" praapt karti he, matlab kuch log vittiya sahaayta pradaan karte hai jiskaa arth he: aamtaur par ek bada film studio, film concil yaa swatantra niveshak
 judi hui partiyaan baatcheet karti hai or ek samjhaute par hastakshar karti hai
 Once all the parties have met and the deal is finalized, the film can move towards the pre-construction period
 is str tak, film ke paas ek spasht rup se paribhaashit vipanan ranneeti or lakshya darshak hone chahie
 In pre-production, every step of making a film is actually carefully planned and designed
 nirmaan company banaai jaati he or nirmaan karyaalay kii sthapana kii jaati he
 The production is planned and visualized with the help of painters and concept artists
 film ke liye yojana vyay hetu ek production bajet taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Major productions are insured against accident protection
 nirmaataa ek dal ko kaam par rakhata he
 During film production, the size and type of crew working according to the nature and budget of the film is determined
 kai hollywood kii pramukh filmon main saikadon kalakaar or chaalak dal niyukt kiye jate hai, jabaki ek kam bajet vaali or swatantra film ko aath yaa nau kii nunatam sankhya ke karmiyon ko lekar banaaya ja saktaa he
 These are the crew of all specific positions: nirmaan main, video / film banaai or shoot kii jaati he
 In this phase more crew is recruited such as property owners, script supervisors, assistant directors, portrait photographers, picture editors and sound editors
 These are all common roles in filmmaking, with the production office free to create any unique mix of roles in terms of various potential responsibilities during filmmaking
 ek vishisht din kii shooting chaalak dalon ke nirdhaarit set / lokation par bulaae gaye samay par pahunchane ke saath hi shuru hoti he
 Actors usually have their own separate call times
 chunki set nirmaan, dressing or liting main ghanto yaa ek din bhi lag sakate hai, isliye praaia: unhen pehle hi taiyaar kar liya jaataa he
 GREEP, power and production design crews are usually one step ahead of the camera and sound departments: for the sake of efficiency, while a scene is being filmed, they are already preparing for the next
 jab chaalak dal apane upkaran taiyaar karte hai, abhinayta apni veshbhusha ke liye vastraagaar, bal or shringaar vibhaagon ke chakkar laga rahe hote hai
 The actors bond with the director to rehearse the script and the camera and sound crew also rehearse with them and produce the final tweak
 ant main, ection ko nirdeshak kii ichchhaaon ke anuroop kai tekon main shoot kiya jaataa he
 Most American productions follow a specific process: sahaayak nideshak sabhi ko yah suchit karne ke liye ki tech rirkad hone vaala he "pikchar ij ap" kah kar bulaata he
 And then says "quiet Abrivan"
 ek baar jab har koi shoot karne ke liye taiyaar ho jaataa he, vah "role round" kah kar pukaarata he or production sound mixr apane yantron ko chalaa detaa he, tech kii soochnaaon ke ek maukhik slate ko record karata he or ghoshnaa karata he "sound speed" jab ve taiyaar ho jate hai
 Eddie then says "roll camera" and once the camera starts recording, the camera operator replies "speed"
 The clapper, which is already in front of the clapboard's seven cameras, says "marker!" And jerks off
 yadi tech main atirikt yaa prishthbhumi ection shaamil rahata he to edi usko kataribaddh karata he or sabase ant main nirdeshak hota he jo abhinaytaon ko "ection!" kahata he
 When the director "cut!" Says, a take is over and the camera and sound stop recording
 patakatha paryvekshak kisi bhi nirantarata ke muddon ko note karata he or sound or camera kii timen apni-apni shit par takneekee tippaniyan darj karti hai
 If the director decides that additional takes are needed, the entire process is repeated
 jab vah santusht ho jaataa he, chaalak dal agle camera kone yaa "seoup," kii ore badhate he," jab tak ki puraa drishy "cover" nahin ho jaataa
 jab ek drishy ke liye shooting samaapt ho jaati he to sahaayak nirdeshak ek "rap" yaa "mowing on" kii ghoshnaa karata he or chaalak dal us drishy ke set ko roak dete hai yaa vighatit kar dete hai
 At the end of the day, the director approves the next day's shooting schedule and a daily progress report is sent to the production office
 isamen nirantarata, dhwani or camera tiimon kii report shit shaamil rahati hai
 Call sheets are distributed among the cast and crew to tell when and where the next day's shooting will take place
 baad main, nirdeshak, nirmaataa, anya vibhaag ke pramukh or, kabhi kabhi, kalakaar bhi us din, yaa beete hue din ke photege, jise dalies kaha jaataa he, ko dekhne ke liye or apane kaary kii samiksha ke liye ikatthe ho sakate hai
 With working days lasting 14 or 18 hours in remote locations, filmmaking creates a team spirit
 jab puri film puri ho sakane kii avasthaa main yaa nirmaan charan kii samaapti kii sthiti main hoti he, prathanusaar nirmaan karyaalay sabhi kalakaaron or chaalak dalon kaa dhanyavad gyaapit karne ke liye ek rap party yojit karata he
 Here the video / film is collected by the video / film editor
 film nirmaan kii prakriya main video kii aadhunik upyogita ke kaaran do verient parinaam nikle hai: ek puri tarah se film kaa upyog kar or anya film or video ke mishran kaa upyog kar
 In film work, the original camera film is developed and copied into a one-light workprint for editing with a mechanical editing machine
 pikchar frem kii sthiti ko bataane ke liye film main ek ez code ko record kiya jaataa he
 Since the development of non-linear editing systems such as Avid or Final Cut Pro, film workflows have been used by some productions
 video varkelo main, mul camera negative ko viksit kiya jaataa he or computer editing software se sampadan karne ke liye use telesine kiya jaataa he
 a timecode is recorded in the video to locate the position of the picture frame
 is prakriya ke dauraan nirmaan dhwani ko bhi video pikchar frem ke saath-saath badhaayaa jaataa he
 The first job of a film editor is to produce a rough cut from sequins based on individual "text"
 raf cat kaa uddeshy sabase achche shot kaa chunaav karnaa or use kram main sajaana hota he
 The director usually works with the editor to ensure that the corresponding shots are selected
 aglaa kadam sabhi drishyon ke dwaara ek badhiya cat nirmit karnaa hota he taaki vah ek akhand kahani ke saath sahaj rup se pravaahit ho sake
 Trimming, a process of sorting scenes in seconds, or even frames, occurs during this phase
 fine cat ke chun liye jane ke baad or nirdeshak or nirmaataa dwaara anumodith hone ke baad film ko "taala band" kar diya jaataa he, jiskaa matlab yah hota he ki ab usamen koi parivartan nahin kiya jayega
 iske baad, sampadak swat: yaa haath se negative cat suchi yaa ek sampadan nirnay suchi banaata he
 These editing lists identify the source of each scene's picture frame in Fine Cut
 ek baar jab pikchar lock kar di jaati he to use sound trek banane ke liye dhwani-vibhaag ke postproduction dhwani paryvekshan sampadak ke haathon main saunp diya jaataa he
 The voice recordings are synchronized and the final sound mix is produced by the re-recording mixer
 dhwani mishran main samvaad, dhwani prabhaav, atomos, ediaar, valla, pholage or sangeet shaamil hai
 The sound track and picture are combined together and are the result of low quality answer prints in the film
 ab recording madhyam par nirbhar karte hue ucch gunvattta release print kaa nirmaan karne ke liye do sambhavit workelo hote hai: Finally the film is previewed by the target audience in general and further shooting and editing can be done based on the responses
 film ko ek saath rakhane ke do tareeke ho sakate hai
 One way is linear editing and the other is non-linear editing
 rekhiy sampadan film kaa upyog is tarah se karata he jaise yah ek satat film he
 All the parts of the film are already in order and there is no need to move them around
 iske vipareet, gaiyr rekhiy sampadan main tepe kiye gaye kram ko dhyaan main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 Views can be rotated around or even removed
 yah antim charan he, jahaan film cinemagharon main relies kii jaati he yaa, kabhi-kabhi upabhokta madhyam main relies kii jaati he, yaa prowider se sidhe-sidhe downlod kii jaati he
 The film is duplicated according to the need of distribution in theaters
 press kit, poster or anya vigyaapan saamagree prakashit kii jaati he or film kaa prachaar kiya jaataa he
 Film companies usually release the film with a launch party, press release, interview with the press, press review screening and film festival screening
 adhikansh filmon kii ek website hoti he
 The film runs in selected theaters and dvds are usually released after a few months
 film or dividi ke vitaran kaa adhikaar bhi aam taur par duniya bhar main vitaran ke liye bechaa jaataa he
 The distributor and the production company share the profits
 film nirmaan mukhya dhara ke baahar bhi hota he or aamtaur par ise swatantra film nirmaan kaha jaataa he
 The means of production has become more republican since the introduction of DV technology
 film nirmaataa sambhavit rup se film ko shoot or sampadit kar sakate hai, dhwani or sangeet bana or sampadit kar sakate hai or apane ghar ke computer par antim cat ko mix kar sakate hai
 However, even if the means of production become republican, it is very difficult to move out of the traditional system due to investment, traditional distribution and marketing
 ateet main, adhiktar swatantra film nirmaataa apane film par dhyaan dilaane or vitaran ke liye bechney kii garaj se filmotsavon par bharosa karte the
 However, the Internet has provided a relatively inexpensive means of distribution of independent films

 Raghunath Vinayak Dhulekar was a prominent fighter, writer, member of the First Lok Sabha and a member of the Indian Constituent Assembly of the Indian freedom struggle
 unhone bharat chodo aandolan tathaa dandi march main sakriy bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Dhulekar was born in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh
 10 may 1912 ko unka vivaah janaki se hua
 He obtained BA degree in 1914 from Kolkata University and MA degree in 1916 from Allahabad University
 jhaansi main unhone vakaalat karnaa shuru kiya
 On 10 December 1946, in the Constituent Assembly it was said by RV Dhulekar to make Hindi language iconic and the language of the public mind: aryabhatiy naamak granth kii rachana aryabhat pratham ne kii thi
 It is a treatise of mathematics and astronomy composed in poetry in Arya verse in Sanskrit language
 isaki rachanapaddati bahut hi vaigyanik or bhashaa bahut hi sankshipt tathaa manji hui he
 It has 123 verses in four chapters
 aryabhatiy, dasgitika paad se armbh hoti he
 Its four chapters are as follows: 1
 dash-geetika-paad 2
 Mathematics - Astronomical constants and Sine tables; Mathematics required for calculations 3
 kaal-kriya-paad - samay-vibhaajan tathaa grahon kii sthiti kii gananaa ke liye niyam 4

 To this end, they have used a unique method of writing numbers by Akshara in a nutshell, in which numbers were used to indicate simple numbers and vowels counted zero
 udhaahrant: In Q3 = 43,20,000 k is written for 2 and y for 30
 donon akshar milakar likhe gaye hai or unamem u kii maatra lagi he, jo 10,000 ke samaan he; isliye khyu kaa arth hua 3,20,000; ghri ke gh kaa arth he 4 or ri kaa 10,00,000, isliye ghri kaa arth hua 40,00,000
 is tarah khyughri kaa uparyukt maan hua
 The biggest flaw in this method of writing numbers is that if the letters are manipulated a little, then a big mistake can be made
 doosraa dosha yah he ki l main ri kii maatra lagaai jaay to iskaa rup vahi hota he jo lri swar kaa, parantu donon ke arthon main bada antar padataa he
 Despite these flaws, Aryabhata's talent has to be admired for this system

 In the last verse, the fruit of knowing what was said earlier is told

 bimbo shabd angreji bhashaa main aam taur par ek aisi mahila ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he jo shaareerik rup se aakarshak ho lekin jo murkh yaa alpashikshit ho
 is shabd kaa upyog ek aisi mahila kaa varnan karne ke liye bhi kiya ja saktaa he jo yon rup se vivekahin vyavhaar karti he
 The term began to be used in the United States in 1919, where it was used to refer to a foolish or bestial male
 1929 main ise pehali baar iske streeling arth ke liye ek adhikarik shabdkosh main shaamil kiya gaya, jisamen ise "ek mahila" ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya tha
 The term bimbo is often associated with the orthodox "dum Blonde" and "valley Girl" or the New Zealand "shore Girl", but is distinct from them
 angreji main bimbo shabd kaa pehla upyog ek murkh purush ke liye kiya gaya tha, haalanki ise ab saamanytah ek mahila ke sandarbh main hi istemaal kiya jaataa he jab tak kii ise mail bimbo yaa himbo main parivartit naa kiya jaye

 The first refers to a foolish and poorly educated attractive woman, while the second refers to women with less sexual control and sexually behaving in multiple ways
 cosmetic surgery ke lokapriya hone ke baad, ek vyakti jo apane kathith aakarshan ko badhaane ke liye ise karwaata he, ko bhi bimbo kah kar sanderbhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Although the term bimbo was formerly used as a derogatory term, in recent years the term was changed to a more neutral term to classify a person with a particular trait
 mukhya rup se mashhoor hastiyon, visheshkar modelon or abhinaytaon, ke sandarbh main aisi sthiti pesh ai he jinamein se kuch ko media main bina asammanneey arth ke bhi bimbo ke rup main sanderbhit kiya ja saktaa he
 This was supported by changing views, as well as studies that suggested that due to a bimbo being considered foolish or undernourished, they would instead try to compensate in other areas, either physical or social
 
 This is reflected in how a woman with characteristics associated with the name Bimbo is more likely to have a more stable and successful relationship so that they can improve the lifestyle of themselves and their future children

 sunahare baalo kaa aam samavesh paaramparik europea dharna ke kaaran he ki sunahare bal sundar hote hai or ek vistaar ke rup main "dam blond" steriotip
 The word is derived from the Italian word bimbo, which is derived from a pulling word bambino and meaning child or very young child)
 The term began to be used in the United States in 1919 and was a slang term used to describe a foolish or bestial male
 1930 ke dashak ke pehle tak bimbo shabd ko mahilaon ke saath nahin joda jaataa tha

 While the term always has a negative connotation with the current meaning, its derogatory qualities have been reduced in recent years to make "bimbo" a more neutral term
 It retained its definition as attractive but silly or sexually unrestrained women, but the term is not used exclusively in the negative genre in the media, such as women's magazines and gossip magazines
 iske bajaay ise mukhyatah bimbo ke saath jude aam visheshtaon ko shaamil karne ke liye or ek vyakti ko ek bimbo ke rup main vargeekrut karne ke liye upyog main laayaa jaataa he
