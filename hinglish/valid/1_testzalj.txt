pataa chalaa ki saath-saath sab vitaminon ko aavashyak maatra main vidyaman rahanaa chahie
 Due to deficiency of vitamins, diseases like beriberi, vulva skin, hair follicle, etc
 are caused
 ab yah nirnay ho chukaa he ki manushya ko koun-koun se vitaminon kaa or pratidin kitni-kitni matraaon main milanaa aavashyak he or yah bhi kin-kin aaharon main kitni-kitni matraaon main upasthit rahete hai
 They are usually found in sufficient quantity with a balanced daily diet
 bhojan santulit na hone se sharir main vitamin kii kami ke chihn prakat hone lagate hai
 During the Second World War, along with the lack of different types of diet, there was also a shortage of protein
 isse sansar ke prayek desh main saadhaaran janata ko uttam proteinous bhojan milanaa durlabh ho gaya
 Many kinds of diseases started due to this, because the body's protective power was depleted
 isse spasht ho gaya ki bhojan main uttam proteinon kaa rpyaapt maatra main rahanaa paramaavashyak he
 For this reason, scientists started searching for the best proteins
 dekha gaya ki doodh, maance, machhlee or anda ke atirikt yeast or soyabean ke protein bhi ati uttam hai
 Both of these also have absolutely essential amino acids
 maance ke protein main jo gunakari amino amla hote hai, ve sab inamen bhi hai
 During this period, it has been known from the research that to get all types of amino acids, it is necessary to have different types of proteins in human diet, which are found in different substances
 iskaa bhi anveshan kiya gaya ki yeast or soyabean ko kis prakaar banaaya jaay ki ve swaadisht ho jaaen
 Nowadays, amino-acid is prepared by mixing it in other human diet
 aise mishran kii gandh saadhaarant: bahut buree hoti he
 Substantial efforts are also being made to kill this smell and make the mixed diet interesting
 is kaal main yah paaya gaya ki swasthya yaa shareeravriddhi ke liye bhojan sab avyavon protein, carbohydrate, vasa, vitamin, lavan aadi kaa upyukt anupaaton main aahaar main vartmaan rahanaa aavashyak he
 a slight variation in the proportions does not harm, but health is not good if there is too much deficit
 bhartiya aahaaron main achche protein kii vishesh kami rahati he, kyonki bahut se log maance aadi nahin khate or mahangaa hone ke kaaran doodh, dahi kaa bhi seven nahin kar pate
 But it is necessary for many types of good proteins to be edible
 sambhav ho to inhen doodh, anda, maansaadi bhinn-bhinn padaarthon se praapt karnaa chahie
 Water and various salts are also very important for the physical process
 pachan ke pashchaat aahaar ke avyav jal dwaara hi sharir ke bhinn-bhinn bhaagon main pahonchte hai
 The salts reach the cells and endothelial spaces only by water
 rakt kii dravtaa bhi jal ke hi kaaran bani rahati he
 Different amounts of salts are present in different places
 is maatra kii thodi bahut newnata yaa adhikta se shaareerik prakriyaaon main koi vikruti nahin utpann hoti, kintu vishesh kami hone se tarah-tarah ke vikaar utpann ho jate hai
 These salts are also of great importance to the body
 sharir se vishesh maatra main lavan nikal jane se, jaise pasinaa dwaara yaa patale daston dwaara, haath paanv kii peshiyon main shithilataa or anthan aane lagati he
 If these salts are not replenished for some time, then death can occur

 In the Cabellas subfamily, horses are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the forest as autocratic horses

 Its scientific name is derived from the Latin Equus, meaning horse, but the second member of this family is divided into six subcastes of the same race as the Equus

 to kitna paisa apane khate main yah sakriy he? kitna jokhim yah virodh kar sakate hai? For example, the amount in the account fell to $ 6000 to buy 1 / dollar: 01:20 qamar kas: $ 5,000 dhan kaa viniyog, saath hi khate main 1,000 dollar se sakriy he, aap jokhim bazaar keemat main utaar chadhaav se 100 ank, margin kol kii ghatana kaa nuksaan, pranali aap ke liye majaboor ho jayega jab 100 ank, virodh kar sakate hai padon
 1: 100 leverage: loss of 500 points to market price fluctuations, margin call occurs, the system will force flat when the account is activated by the use of funds in the $ 1000 as well as $ 5000 You can resist positions of 500 points, positions
 1:400 baar uttolan: puunji khate main 250 dollar, 5750 dollar par kabja kar liya upar bazaar mulya main parivartan ghaataa 575 ank, margin kol hota he, pranali aap ke liye anivaary ho jayega, jab 575 ank ke jokhim kaa virodh kar sakate hai, abhi bhi sakriy he padon
 Finally, we can conclude that: in the case of funds under the same account, the same number of hands, the higher the leverage ratio, the smaller the risk! But leverage is also a double-edged sword that they can not easily lead to a very good understanding of the situation, not a good allocation of funds, when leverage is not very good, too much or too little

 Pixel data is encoded using tmds's own 8b / 10b encoding scheme
 is yojana ke do charan hai
 The first step is to minimize the changes by determining which of these two methods leads to the least change
 donon vidhiyon main, pehali bit hameshaa khud kutabaddh hoti he
 In one method, the bits located before them are encoded by xnoring before each of the eight bits is encoded
 duusari vidhi main, aath biton main se prayek duusari ko kutabaddh karne se pehle exoring dwaara unase pehle sthit bit ko kutabaddh kiya jaataa he
 The selected method is represented in the ninth bit of the code word before proceeding to the second step
 agar yah bit ek shunya he, to iskaa arth he kii exenoar / XNOR vidhi kaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 Otherwise, the XOR / XOR method was used
 doosraa charan disi santulan ko banaae rakhane ke liye he
 To do this, the ninth bit of the code that was created in the first step may need to be changed
 yadi aisa kiya gaya tha to dasvin bit ko 1 par set kiya jaataa he
 Otherwise, the tenth bit is set to zero
 jaisaa ki vinirdesan ke sanskaran 1

 This party works on the principle of liberalism and is commonly known as a center party in Canadian political circles
 aitihaasik rup se liberlon ko canada kii conzarvative party ke baayen or new democratic party ke daayen sthaan mila he
 The party has dominated federal politics for much of Canada's history, holding power for almost 69 years in the 20th century — more than any other party in a developed country — and as a result, it is sometimes referred to as Canada's "natural governing party" 
 The party's signature policies and legislative decisions include universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, Canada Student Loans, peacekeeping, multilateralism, official bilingualism, official multiculturalism, patriating the Canadian constitution and the entrenchment of Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Clarity Act, restoring balanced budgets in the 1990s, and making same-sex marriage legal nationwide
 During the beginning of the 21st century, the party lost a significant amount of support, to the benefit of both the Conservatives and the NDP
 In the 2011 federal election, the Liberals had the worst showing in its history, capturing only 19 percent of the popular vote and 34 seats—becoming the third-place party in the House of Commons for the first time
 In the 2015 federal election, the Liberal Party under Justin Trudeau returned to prominence with its best showing since the 2000 election, winning 39
5 percent of the popular vote and 184 seats, thus regaining a majority of seats in the House of Commons
 The principles of this party, as the name suggests, are based on liberalism about which various liberal thinkers have written from time to time
 yah saamaajik udaarvaad ke liye vyaktigat swatantraaa, himmedaari, nyaaypurna samaajik vyavastha, raajnneetik va dharmik swatantraaa, rashtriya ekta, sambhaavnaaon va sansadhano main barabari, saanskrithik bahultawad, bahubhashi samaaj kaa samarthan karti he
 At present, this liberal party has supported various aspects of right and left ideologies
 1993 se 2006 ke dauraan banaai apni sarkaron main isane santulit bajet pesh karne main maharath hasil kii
 It left economic policies such as subsidies that burden the federal treasury to the provincial governments since 1995 and promised to change the excise and service tax in its red book

 On April 14, 2013, Justin Trudeau, son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was elected leader of the Liberal Party
 in antarik chunaavon main unhen 80% se zyada mat mili
 After his victory, support for the Liberal party increased significantly and the party reached the first position in the poll surveys
 tmaudeu ke chune jane se pehle labrador main may 13, 2013 ko ek upachunaav hua tha
 Labrador, formerly a Liberal stronghold, won the 2011 federal elections by Conservative candidate Peter Penashue

 This was preceded by an increase of 111 seats in the 1984 elections under the leadership of only Brian Mulroney

 Then, while walking, reached the place from where the sound of crying was coming
 unhone dekha ki jhaadiyon main baithi ek stri ro rahi he
 They asked the woman the reason for crying
 stri ne kaha ki vah kai logon ko apni vyathaa suna chuki he, magar koi phayda nahin hua
 The king assured him that they would do everything possible to help him
 tab stri ne bataaya ki vah ek chor kii patni he or pakade jane par nagar kotwaal ne use vriksh par ulataa tangava diya he
 The king asked whether he was not happy with this decision

 Since justice does not mention that she is hungry and thirsty, she wants to give him food and water

 At this the woman said that her husband was so high that she could not reach him without any help and no one would be ready to help the punished person for fear of the king
 tab vikram ne kaha ki vah unke saath chal sakati he
 Actually, the woman was a vampire and the person hanging was not her husband

 He was a Turkmen and his clan had greatly assisted the Safavis since the time of Shah Ismail I
 us samay faras kii gaddi par safaviyon kaa shashan tha
 But Nadir Shah's future was not due to Shah's coup which is often with many successful generals
 usne safaviyon kaa saath diya
 At that time, Safavi was very happy to find Nadir Shah in his decadent empire
 ek taraf se osmani samrajya to duusari taraf se afagaanon ke vidroh ne safaviyon kii naak main dam kar rakhaa tha
 Apart from this, the Russian Empire was also eyeing from the north

 Together with him, he drove the Afghans out of Mashhad in northern Iran and took them under his control
 uski is seva se prabhavit hokar use tahmaasya quli khan kii oopaadhi mili
 It was an honor because it gave him the royal name

 After this the practice started - chakra, array of composition and horse riding etc 

 Nadir himself practiced on horse for three hours
 san 1729 ke ant tak usne afagaanon ko teen baar haraaya or isiahaan waapas apane niyantran main le liya
 He allowed the Afghans to flee safely
 iske baad usne baari sainya abhiyaan kii yojana banaai

 His military success was not seen from Tehmashp
 use takhtapalat kaa dar hone laga
 He resumed the war with the Osman with the aim of proving his military worthiness, which ended up embarrassing him and he had to return some of the territories Usman had won
 nadir jab heraat se lautaa to yah dekhakar kshubdh hua
 He sought his support from the public

 At the time of his coronation, Nadir announced that he would defeat the rulers of Kandahar, Delhi, Bukhara and Istanbul
 darbar main upasthit logon ko laga ki yah charam atmapravanchanaa ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 But in time to come, he came to know that it was not so
 usne pashchim kii disha main osmanon par akraman ke liye sena taiyaar kii
 But he was defeated in his first attack
 osmanon ne baghdad kii raksha ke liye ek baari sena bhej di jiskaa nadir koi jabaab nahin de paaya
 But within a few months he reorganized the army
 is baar usne kirkuk ke paas osmanion ko haraa diya
 In June 1735 near Yerevan he defeated the Osmanis once again with the help of the Russians

 The Safawis were Shia and under them the Shia people got rid of the atrocities of the Arabs
 aaj iran kii janata shiya he or vahaan shuruaati teen khalifaaon ko gaali dene kii parampara he
 Nadir Shah, while holding his throne, placed a condition that people would give up this disrespect towards those Caliphs
 isse use faaydaa bhi mila
 Shia Sunni tension in Iran not only decreased but at the same time Iran was seen as another center of Islam
 nadir armeniyon ke saath bhi udaar dharmik sambandh rakhata tha
 His rule was a time of peace for the Jews as well
 apane samrajya ke andar usne sunni mazahab ko janata par ladane kii koi koshish nahin ki lekin samrajya ke baahar wo sunni parivartit rajya ke shah ke rup main janaa jane laga
 It began to be compared to the Osmani empire, which was the Surveyor of Islam at that time

 After being satisfied in the direction of the west, Nadir Shah shifted his focus towards the east
 sainya kharch kaa bhaar janata par padaa
 He took control of Kandahar
 is baat kaa bahaanaa bana kar ki mughalon ne afagaan bhagodon ko sharan de rakhi he usne mughal samrajya kii ore kooch kiya
 After capturing Kabul, he invaded Delhi
 karnal main mughal raja mohammad shah or nadir kii sena ke bich ladaai hui
 In this, Nadir's army was smaller than the Mughals, but the Persian army won because of its landmines
 uske march 1739 main dilli pahunchne par yah afawaah faili ki nadir shah maaraa gaya
 This caused a stampede in Delhi and the Persian army was killed
 usne iskaa badla lene ke liye dilli main bhayanak khoonkhraba kiya or ek din main koi 20,000 - 22,000 log maar die
 Apart from this, he also took a lot of money from Shah
 mohammad shah ne sindhu nadi ke pashchim kii sari bhoomi bhi nadir shah ko daan main de di
 He was also presented with a volley of diamond jewels which included Cohenoor, dariya-noor and taj-e-mah, each with their own bloody story
 nadir ko jo smapda mili wo kareeb 70 karod rupayon kii thi
 This amount was comparable to the erstwhile Seven Year War in which the French government gave the Austrian government
 nadir ne dilli main samrajya vistaar kaa lakshya nahin rakhaa
 His aim was to collect the necessary funds for his army which he got
 kaha jaataa he ki dilli se lautne par uske paas itnaa dhan ho gaya tha ki agle teen varshon tak usne janata se kar nahin liya tha
 On his return from Delhi, he learns that his son Raza Quli, whom he had made as the voicerai in his absence, has killed Safavi Shah Tahamashap and Abbas
 isse usko bhanak mili ki raza uske kilaaf bhi shadyantra rach rahaa he
 With this fear, he removed Raza from the Viceroy
 iske baad wo turkestan ke abhiyaan par gaya or uske baad dagestan ke vidroh ko daman karne niklaa
 But he did not get success here
 lezgon ne khandak yuddh niti apanaai or rashad ke kaaravaan par akraman kar nadir ko pareshaan kar daalaa
 While he was in Dagestan, Nadir received the news that Raza was planning to kill him
 isse wo kshubdh hua or usne raza ko andhaa kar diya
 Raza said that she is innocent but Nadir did not listen to her
 lekin kuch hi din baad nadir ko apni galati par khed hua
 By this time Nadir had fallen ill and was very upset to blind his son
 nadir shah ne aadesh diya ki un saradaaron ke sir uda die jaayen jinhone uske bete raza quli kii ankhen phodi jate dekha he
 Nadir Shah blamed the chieftains for why none of them said that his eyes should be blown instead of Raza Quli
 dagestan kii asafalataa bhi use khaae ja rahi thi
 Gradually he became more tyrannical
 usne dagestan se khaali haath waapas lautne ke baad usne apni sena ek bahut puraane lakshya ke liye phir se sangathit kii - pashchim kaa osmani samrajya
 At that time when the army was organized it was counted as 3,75,000 soldiers
 itani badi sena us samay shaayad hi kisi samrajya ke paas ho
 Iran's own army has never been so big before the Iran - Iraq war of 1980 - 1988
 san 1743 main usne osmani samrajya iraq par hamalaa kiya
 He did not face much opposition except in cities
 kirkuk par uskaa adhikaar ho gaya lekin baghdad or basra main use safalataa nahin mili
 His ambition came to an end in Mosul and he had to compromise with Osman
 nadir ko ye samaj main aayaa ki osmani uske niyantran main nahin aa sakate
 New Usmani troops were sent against him
 nadir shah ke bete nasirullah ne inamen se ek ko haraaya jabaki nadir ne yerawan ke nikat 1745 main ek duusare jatthe ko haraaya
 But this was his last big victory
 isamen osmanon ne use nazaf par shashan kaa adhikaar diya
 Nadir's end was beset by his illnesses
 vah dinanudin biimaar, atyaachaari or kattar ho chalaa tha
 In his last days he imposed heavy taxes on the public and even started demanding money from his close relatives
 uskaa sainya kharch kaafii bad gaya tha
 His nephew, Ali Quli, refused to obey his orders
 19 june 1747 main mashhad ke nikat uske apane hi angrakshakon ne uski hatya kar daali
 Nadir Shah's achievements could not last long
 uske marane ke baad ali quli ne swayan ko shah ghoshit kar diya
 He named his name Adil Shah
 nadir ke marane ke baad sena teetar bitar ho gai or samrajya ko kshatrapon ne swatantra rup se shashan karnaa shuru kar diya
 European influence also increased
 nadir ko europe main ek vijeta ke rup main khyaati mili thi
 In 1768, Christian VII of Denmark ordered Sir William Jones to translate his biography written by Persian historian Mirza Mahdi Astarabadali into Persian from French
 1739 main uski bharat vijay ke baad angrezon ko mughalon kii kamazori kaa pataa chalaa or unhone bharat main samrajya vistaar ko ek mauka samaj kar damakham lagaakar koshish kii
 If Nadir Shah did not invade India, the British might not even think of taking possession of India in this way or challenge Indian rule on such a large scale

 nanarav dhundhupant ko isse bada ksht hua kyonki unhen anek ashriton kaa bharan poshan karnaa tha
 Nana Saheb wrote to Lord Dalhousie to get a pension, but when he refused, he appointed Azimullah Khan as his advocate and sent it to Queen Victoria
 ajimullah ne anek praytn kiye par asafal rahe
 On his return, he traveled to France, Italy and Russia etc
 waapas aakar ajimullah ne naanaa sahab ko apni vifaltaa, angrejon kii vaastavik paristhiti tathaa europe ke swadhinata andolanon kaa gyaan karaayaa
 Nanarao Dhundhupant suffered greatly from the attitude of the British Government
 ve chup baithanevaale na the
 He started the pilgrimage at this time
 naanaa sahab kaa is umr main tirthayatra par nikalnaa kuch rahasyatmak sa jaan padataa he
 In 1857, he went to Kalpi, Delhi and Lucknow
 kalpi main aapane bihar ke prasiddh kunwar singh se bhent kii or bhavi kranti kii kalpana kii
 When the revolution began in Meerut, Nana Saheb led the armies of the revolution in secret and overtly with great valor and efficiency
 kranti prarambh hote hi unke anuyaayiyon ne angreji khajaane se saadhe aath lakh rupaya or kuch yudhsaamagree praapt kii
 The British of Kanpur were imprisoned in a stronghold and the revolutionaries hoisted the Indian flag there
 sabhi krantikari dilli jane ko kanpur main ekatra hue
 Nana Saheb led them and prevented them from going to Delhi because they would have taken more danger there
 kalyanpur se hi naanaa sahab ne yuddh kii ghoshnaa kii
 He divided his troops into several troops
 jab sab angrej kanpur ke satichaura ghat se naavon par ja rahe the to krantikariyon ne unpar goliyaan chalaayin or unamem se bahut se maare gaye
 British historians blame Nana only for this, but there is no sufficient evidence in his favor
 
 On 1 July 1857, when the British left Kanpur, Nana Saheb declared complete independence and also assumed the title of Peshwa
 naanaa sahab kaa adamya saahas kabhi bhi kam nahin hua or unhone krantikari senaaon kaa baraabar netritv kiya
 In the places of Fatehpur and Aang etc
, there were fierce battles with Nana's team and the British
 kabhi krantikari jite to kabhi angrej
 However, the British kept on growing
 iske ananthar naanaa sahab ne angrejon senaaon ko badhate dekh naanaa sahab ne ganga nadi paar kii or lakhanu ko prasthaan kiya
 Nana Saheb returned to Kanpur once again and when he came there and the English army took the route between Kanpur and Lucknow in his possession, Nana Saheb left Awadh and went towards Rohelkhand
 ruhelkhand pahunchakar unhone khan bahadur khan ko apana sahyog diya
 By now the British had understood that unless Nana Saheb was caught, the rebellion could not be suppressed
 jab bareli main bhi krantikariyon kii haar hui tab naanaa sahab ne maharana pratap kii bhanti anek ksht sahe parantu unhone firangiyon or unke mitron ke sanmukh aatmasamarpan nahin
 The British government declared great prizes for the capture of Nana Saheb, but he failed
 sachmuch naanaa sahab kaa tyaag evam swatantry, unki veerta or sainik yogyata unhen bhartiya itihaas ke ek pramukh vyakti ke asana par bitha detii he
 
 pandlpuran main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke karnulu jile kaa ek gaanv he
