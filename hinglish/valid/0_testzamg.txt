 gati or twaran kaa avrodh karne ke liye mukhya yantra ke saath jo upayantra lagaaya jaataa he, use hi rodhak yaa brake kehete hai
 By employing natural forces in mechanics, achieving the desired kind of speed and acceleration, the work of more importance than taking useful work from it is to intercept their speed and acceleration properly at the desired time
 sahi kaam karne kii drushti se or rajkeey niyamon ke anusaar suraksha kii drushti se bhi, prayek chalanevaale yantra ke saath brake kaa hona aavashyak he
 Many types of mechanical and natural forces are also used to activate the blocking device and many types of mechanical applications are also used in these devices
 in bhinnataaon ke kaaran brikon kaa vargeekaran nimnlikhit teen kotiyon main kiya jaataa he : Strap Brake: It has a flexible strap, abrasion due to friction by tightening the brake drum
 gutka brake : isamen vrutt-khandaakaar gutke, liveron ke sahare se latakaakar, pahie yaa dhol kii paridhi ke sampark main laae jate hai
 Axial brake: The brakes which are applied on the main axle or its parallel parts in lieu of wheels or drums are called axial brakes
 inhen ke anya naam baariya brake, suraksha, swachal or yantric brake bhi hai
 They are designed in such a way that the speed of the deceleration is proportional to the thrust on the axle, as in electric and manual cranes
 jab bijli kii chaalak shakti, athwa haath kaa bal, aksmaat nirbal pad jaay, to is prakaar ke brake ke dwaara latakta hua bojha vahiin kaa vahiin ruk jaataa he
 For this reason, this brake is called automatic, but it is not the type of automatic brake that is used automatically in trains
 lagbhag sabhi prakaar ke brikon main gatyavrodh kaa kaaran dhol, pahie, athwa dhure aadi, ke saath honevaala gharshan hi he, lekin silinder or piston kii shakti se chalanevaale ingine or yantron main yadi piston kii duusari taraf bhi kaaryakari madhyam, yatha vaashp, yaa sampidit hawa, yaa gas, pahunchaa diya jaae, tab bhi us yantra kii gati kaa avarodhan ho jaataa he
 Such a brake is called frictionless brake
 gatyaatmak brikon kii ginati bhi isi koti main hoti he, udhaahrant: yantra ko gati denevaale bijli ke motor ko kuch kshanon ke liye yadi dianamo main parivartit kar diya jaae, to chaalit yantra kii gati kaa avrodh ho jaataa he
 They are used to stop and stop the speed of electric motors driving cranes and other types of equipment
 yah mukhyatya do prakaar ke hote hai : These include controlling the friction generating parts by electromagnets
 antat: ye brake bhi yantric kriya dwaara kaary karte hai
 These too are of three types according to the design, viz
, Gutka, patched and chakali
 brake kaa dhol kisi bhi disha main chale, gutkon dwaara badi sthirataa se uskaa gatyavrodh hota he
 Stretched brakes tend to require less power than gutted brakes, but this results in movement in one direction and weakening in the other direction
 chakliyukt brake main gharshan chakliyaan, dhure par lagi chakaliyon se ragad khaati hai, jo kamanion kii takat se dabaai jaati hai, lekin unhen chhudaane ke liye parinalika kii chumbakeey shakti kaa upyog karnaa hota he
 This brake makes its impact when moving in both directions and is also more reliable
 pattayukt brikon main saadhaaran upyog ke samay to chumbak kaa bhaar hi kaam karata he or unhen chhudaane ke liye chumbak kaa khichaav
 If this type of brake is used to lift and back the bridges that are open and closed, then the entire brake device itself becomes sloping as the bridge is changed
 aisi haalat main keval chumbak kaa bhaar brikon ko pakadaney kii shakti dene main asamarth rahata he
 Hence, the commanders also have to be used along with it
 brake ke liye chumbak or uski kundaliyaan: jahaan disht dhara kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, vahaan chakliyukt brikon main parinalika prakaar kaa or pattayukt tathaa gutke yukt brikon main ashwanalanuma chumbak kaa, upyog hota he, lekin jahaan patyavarti dhara prayukt hoti he vahaan sab prakaar ke brikon main parinalika chumbak kaa hi praaia: upyog hota he
 But the core of that solenoid has to be layered
 disht dhara ke chumbak kaa kundalikaran niyantrak yantra kii banaavat ke aavashyaktaanusaar shrenee main, athwa parshvavahi rakhaa ja saktaa he
 Often both the motor and the brake are powered by the same controlling device
 at: aisa prabandh kiya jaataa he ki jyon hi chaalak motor ko shakti dena band kiya jaae, tyon hi brikon main shakti kaa aavesh hokar brake swat: hi lag jaaen or jab motor ko pun: shakti di jaae to brake swat: hi chhut jaaen
 In such a scheme, the coils are placed in the category
 jahaan prayaavart dhara kaa upyog hota he vahaan chumbakeey kundaliyaan sadaiv parshvavahi paddati ke anusaar lagaai jaati hai
 The capacity of the solenoid brake is always expressed in terms of the force used in stopping the load and slowing down the speed
 gananaa karte samay purna bhaar vahan karne ke nimitt chaalak motor main jo balaghurna hota he, uskaa yah kuch pratishat ansh rup main liya jaataa he, jiskaa sutara nimna prakaar he: It has been observed from experience that for acceleration, it is 20 to 200% of the total load strength
 jahaan kraine aadi main puure bhaar ko ek dam bich main hi lakatataa hua rokna hota he, vahaan 100% se 200% tak balaghurna laga dena hota he
 20 to 25% of the force is applied in the printing equipment, where there is a fear of a burst of paper and up to 50% in traffic vehicles
 jab kisi dishtdhaara ke parshv kundaliyukt motor uttejit rahata he, usee samay yadi use kisi anya chaalak madhyam dwaara chalit rakhaa jaae, jaise usee ke armechar ke samveg athwa usase sambandhit anya yantron ke samveg dwaara, to vah motor us samay dianamo kaa kaam karne lagata he, kyonki us samay motor kaa dhaatra mukhya shaktistrot se asambaddha hokar dharaniyantrak se sambandhit ho jaataa he, jisase vah motor kii gati kaa avrodh usee prakaar karne lagata he jis prakaar dynamo apane chaalak ingine kii gati kaa avrodh karata he
 When this type of work is taken from the motors of the alternating current, then its wires are connected in the same way as the inverse dynamo
 praaia: prerak motor kaa uttejan nimna voltata kii dishtdhaara se kiya jaataa he or roter ko dhara niyantrak se sambhddha kar dete hai
 By doing this, the speed of the motor is controlled by the amount of resistance in the current controller, as is used in the direction
 gatyaatmak punaryoji pranali ke brikon ke lagate samay jo yantric urja kaa shoshan hota he, vah dhara niyantrak main nasht ho jane ke badale sthir voltiy pranali ko waapas laut jaataa he
 In this system, any type of current can be used, either direct or reverse
 kai brake yantron main gatyaatmak or punaryoji, donon hi prakaar kaa pranaaliyon kaa mishrit upyog hota he
 Brakes, both purely mechanical brakes and hydraulic brakes, are used in motor vehicles
 isamen liveron ko drum kii paridhi par dabaane ke liye cam ke badale ek dumuha silinder laga rahata he, jisamen donon ore do piston lage hote hai
 The main cylinder producing fluid pressure and transmission is located near the engine, in which the mixture of egg oil and ether etc
 is fully filled
 yah badi majboot tathaa lacheelee naliyon dwaara uparyukt drum ke silinderon main ek chota piston usamen bhare drav ko dabaata he, lekin yah drav asampidya hone ke kaaran us daab ko drum main lage silinderon tak pareshit kar, uske pistano ko chalaakar liveron or paridhi ke bich gharshan dwaara gatyavrodh karata he
 The normal pressure of the foot generates pressures up to 100 pounds per square inch in cylinders and up to 350 pounds per square inch when pressed more forcefully when needed
 tram gadiyon main haath ke bal se, sampidit vaayu ke bal se or vidyucchalit teen prakaar ke brake lagaae jate hai
 The brakes applied to the engines and to each vehicle are compressed vapor, air, or vacuum or hand powered
 sampidit hawa tathaa nirvaat ke kaaran chalanevaale brake swayanchalit hote hai, jo railgadiyon ke vafer sanyojakon ke tut jane yaa asambandhit ho jane par, jab train ke do bhaag ho jate hai, swat: hi sab vaahanon main lagaakar train khandon ko roak dete hai
 Every engine and trapezoid wagons and special types of riding compartments must have hand brakes, so that, in the absence of engine power, they must be stopped at the desired location in the yard and are not rolled due to shields or air vents
 
 injanon or unke saath laganevaali koyale or pani kii tankiyon main haath ke atirikt vashpachaalit brake bhi lagaaya jaataa he, jiske brake silinder main jaakar uske piston ko dabaate hai
 This allows the brake blocks to catch the wheels with the help of levers
 yah ingine sahit puri railgadee main kaam karata he
 If there is a steam engine to drive the train, an air compressor pump is run by the steam in its boiler and by the motor in the electric engine, with a pressure of 90 to 100 pounds per square inch in a large main tank on the engine
 The air is filled
 ingine ke peeche chalanevaali gadiyon main bhi ek ek choti sahaayak tank laga di jaati he, jisamen lagbhag 12 se 15 ghan foot tak sthaan rahata he
 When the engine train is burnt, the air buried in the engine's main tank is released into the train pipe, which fills the auxiliary tank through the pipe branches, but in the brake cylinders in the car, this air only Reaches when braking is necessary
 ingine main driver ke brake niyantrak valve ke nikat hi bharan valve laga hota he, jiske madhyam se gaadi ke chalane kii haalat main uski sab tank aadi main 70 pound prati varg inch ke lagbhag hawa kii daab bani rahati he
 Then the driver wants to brake at his own pace, or when there is a breakdown automatically when the brakes are automatically started, the air of the train pipe at some time, whether it is the brake valve of the driver or guard or any other route
 Ho, it starts venturing into the atmosphere, which causes the pistons of triple valves in all trains to slide as the air pressure of the train pipe decreases
 isse prayek gaadi kii tankiyon main bhari hui dabi hawa brake silinderon main jaakar unke pistano kii takat se sarka detii he, jisase liveron ke jariye brake gutke chakkon ko pakad lete hai
 To release the brakes, the pressurized air from the engine's main tank is again filled into the train pipe, causing the piston of the triple valves to return to their old positions as pressure increases
 isse brake silinderon main bhari dabi hawa kaa maarg tripal valve ke madhyam se vayumandal main khul jaataa he or brake chhot jate hai
 Each vehicle in a vacuum brake is fitted with a cylinder, in which a sliding polo piston divides it into two airtight parts
 jis samay gaadiyaan bekaar khadi hoti hai, us samay silinder main piston main donon taraf saadhaaran hawa bhari rahati he or piston apane bojhe se neeche kii taraf baitha rahata he
 When the trains are plowed into the engine, through train pipes, all those cylinders are connected to the engineered ventilator, and with the help of boiler's steam current, the device will wind the train pipes of the overall trains and their respective cylinders
 By throwing them out by suction action, vacuuming them up to 22 inches
 nirvathan ke samay bhi piston ke donon or nirvaat ho jane ke kaaran, vah yathapurv apane bojhe se neeche hi baitha rahata he
 When braking, the driver through his valve, or guard his valve, Or passengers pulling chains; a small valve enters the air in the train pipe
 isse vah pipe kii shakhaon main se hoti hui brake silinderon main pistano ke neeche kii ore pahunch jaati he
 On its way to the top, a round valve is fitted, which is closed by the pressure of the air and the piston remains vacuum upwards due to the non-ventilation
 at: neeche se vayumandal kii hawa use upar uthaa detii he, jisase piston dand se sambandhit brake gutkon ke chakkon ko pakad lete hai
 When the brake is vacuumed again to release, when the air under the piston is released, due to the slight pressure on either side of the piston, it settles down with its burden and the brakes are released

 In astronomy, the white dwarf or white dwarf is called a small star composed of "irrational electron matter"
 "apkrisht electron padaarth" yaa "alectron dijanret matter" main electron apane parmaanuon se alag hokar ek gas kii tarah fail jate hai or nabhik usamen tairte hai
 White dwarfs are very dense - they can hold as much mass as the sun in the small size of the earth
 mana jaataa he ke jin taron main itnaa dravyaman nahin hota ke ve aage chalakar apana indhan khatm ho jane par neutron tara ban saken, ve saare safed boune ban jate hai
 From this perspective, the formation of a white dwarf is written in the fate of 97% of the stars of the galaxy

 kawalam madhav panikkar bharat ke vidwaan, patrkaar, itihaaskaar, prashaasak tathaa rajanyajna the
 He is more famous by the name of Sardar KM Panikkar
 bharat ke aadhunik rajanyagnon main sardaar ke0em0 panikkar ke naam kaa ullekh avashya kiya jaataa he
 Panikkar was India's ambassador to China for a long time
 unka maananaa tha ki rajnay kaa janm europe main aadhunik rajyon ke janm se sambandhit he
 Defining diplomacy, Panikkar said, "diplomacy used in international politics is an art of keeping our interests ahead of other countries
 “ rajnay ek kala he jise apanaakar vishwa ke rajya apane parsparik sambandhon ko badhaate hue apane hit sadhana karte hai
 According to Panikkar, diplomacy is "the eyes and ears of one country located in another country
" “ koi bhi desh apane rajanyagnon ke madhyam se duusare desh kii ghatnaon, nitiyon or drushtikon ke bare main jaankaree praapt kar apni videsh niti ko aavashyak mode detaa rahata he
 Many thinkers have considered tact, skill, treachery etc
 as diplomatic virtues, whereas according to Panikkar, full diplomacy is motivated by a view to achieve good wishes of other countries towards their country, and the path of deceit etc
 Is a dangerous instrument
 duusare desh kii shubhakamanaa, prapti ke lakshya kii purti chaar prakaar se adhik acchhee tarah ho sakati he-duusare desh us desh kii nitiyon ko thik prakaar se samajhen or uske prati sammaan kii bhaavana rakhen, vah desh duusare deshon kii janata ke nyyochit hiton ko samajhe evam sarvopari maane tathaa vah eemaandaaree se vyavhaar kare
 You cannot deceive many people forever
 jab desh kii niti kii asaliyat jaahir ho jaayegi to vishwa-samaaj main us desh ke str ko dhakka pahonchega
 Panikkar believes that honesty is the best policy in international life as in personal life
 panikkar ne rajya ke prati swamibhakti ko ek rajanyajna kaa aavashyak gun mana he
 In his words, "the ambassador has to implement the policy that determines his government
" ye uske swayan ke paramarshon se bhinn ho sakati he kyonki kisi desh kii sarkaar hi puri sthiti se parichit hoti he jabaki rajdoot keval apane vishisht lakshyon ko hi jaanata he
 Therefore, when he has to execute instructions which are fundamentally against his views, he should not be influenced by emotion, partiality or friendship and in any case he should not reveal it even by flicking his eyes to the concerned government
 It is necessary that his own views are not different
 adarsh rajdoot ko kisi bhi paristhiti main apane desh se aae kade nirdeshon ko mridu banaakar apni sarkaar ke vyavhaar kaa galat anumaan nahin dena chaiye bhale hi uske desh kii videsh niti sweekaari rajya ko pasand na ho
 Panikkar, who was himself a successful diplomat, considers women's connection and contact helpful to diplomacy
 san 1926 main francisi rajdoot jules camban ne, ek lekh main likhaa tha ki sammanneey striyon kaa sansarg rajdoot ke liye laabhadaayak hoga
 Renowned Indian scholar Chanakya was opposed to contact with women of ambassadors
 sabhi deshon main striyon kaa prayog rashtriya hit vruddhi ke liye ati prachinkaal se kiya jaataa he
 Such was the use of poison girls of ancient times in Indian history
 pratham vishwayuddh ke kaal main matahari, vikhyath stri jasoos thi
 In the Second World War period, an American sign clerk showed several letters exchanged between Roosevelt and Churchill, falling in love with a Russian migrant girl
 vah ladki vastav main german jasoos thi
 This clerk was sentenced to seven years due to this crime
 panikkar ke anusaar ek adarsh rajdoot ko apni safalataa par garv or asafalataa par niraashaa nahin hona chaiye
 Panikkar has agreed to two basic functions of the ambassador - first, to keep his government informed about the local conditions and policies there
 doosraa apane desh kii videsh-niti ke kriyanvayan ke liye desh se ai aajnaaon kaa safaltaapurvak paalan karnaa
 The responsibility of the success or failure of any ambassador should be on the foreign policy of that country and not on the diplomat, because the ambassador does not form foreign policy, it is the job of his foreign department
 panikkar kaa vichaar he ki vaartaon ke peeche dabaav kaa sabase bhayanak va antim tarika yuddh kaa he
 War is resolved when the possibility of agreement ends, or if the hope of successful outcome of negotiations seems to be weak

 Hell is the antithesis of heaven
 vishwa kii praaia: sabhi jatiyon or dharmon kii aadim tathaa pracheen manyata ke anusaar maranottar adhulok, sthaan yaa avasthaa jahaan kisi devtaa, devdoot yaa rakshas dwaara adharmee, naastik, paapi or apradhi dushtatmaayen dandit hoti hai
 In cold countries, the imagery of hell is usually found in snowy and hot countries
 isaki sthiti, sankhya, prakaar or dandyatnaa ke sambandh main vividh kalpanaayen hai
 The Hindu hell is imagined in the south and lower part of Hades, where on the confirmation of Chitragupta, Yamdevata decides to torture any of the 28 narkas according to his guilt to the sinner to his messengers
 atharvaveda se bhagwat puraana tak aate aate narkon kii sankhya 50 karod ho gai jinamein 21, 28 yaa 40 mukhya hai
 Muslim hell 'and' Jahannum ') is similar to the giant Agnipunj and is situated in the seventh stratum at uddar-ul-shari where the guilty deprived of divine grace are pushed by 19 swaras or messengers under the discipline of an angel called Malik
 parsi narak uttar disha main sthit andhkaar tathaa durgandhapurna, aartnaad se mukherit or asay sheethal he
 Christian hell is described as a blackened pit, a prison of torture, a fiery firelight and a fire of fire
 is prakaar mukhyatah do dhang ke narkon kaa ullekh miltaa he - shitakar or dahakar
 In Buddhism, there are different numbers of both these types of naras, eight and seven respectively
 vidwaanon kaa mat he ki aagney nar kii kalpana isai mul kii he kintu ise puri tarah sahi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 There has been a gradual development of the forms of hell and the notion of punishment against sinners in the hereafter
 bhartiya narak kalpana kaa itihaas rigvaidic athwa usase bhi pracheen ho saktaa he
 Its gradual development has taken place in the Atharvaveda, Vajasaneya Samhita, Shatapatha Brahmana and later Purana literature
 is kram main kathopanishad tathaa darshanashastra main narak or mritatma ke swaroop kii darshanik vyakhyaayein bhi hui hai
 Similarly, in the English version of the verses 'hell' in the Bible, there are various interpretations of Christian hell
 yah pehle mukhyat: old testament ke 'shiun' shabd kaa angreji roopaantar tha jo pracheen yahudee drushtikon ke anusaar mritatmaon kaa awaas he
 Then the same word started being used for 'hades'
 lekin iskaa prayog 'jehenna' ke liye sarvaadhik hota he jiskaa namakaran henom kii ghati ke ek sthaan ke naam par hua or baad main 'bhavidand' ke liye prasiddh hua
 Christian religious reformers had different views against traditional beliefs regarding 'hell'
 martin luther kaa vichaar tha ki papatmaayen mrityu kii sthiti main apni naastik or malin vritti ke kaaran 'antim din' ke purv tak peedit hoti hai
 They denote hell and zero corrupted conscience from the teachings and theism of God
 is prakaar isai narak or narkadand kii manyataon kaa vikaas swayansiddh he
 Apart from this, there are differences between Western and Oriental religions regarding the duration, magnitude, nature of torture, etc

 The Satavahanas were a dynasty of ancient India
 isane isapurv 230 se lekar duusari sadi tak kendriya dakshin bharat par raaj kiya
 It became powerful after the fall of the Maurya dynasty
 inkaa ullekh 8veen sadi isapurv main miltaa he
 After Ashoka's death, the Satavahanas declared themselves independent
 sise kaa sikaa chalaane vaala pehla vansh satvaahan vansh tha, or vah sise kaa sikaa rome se laayaa jaataa tha
 For the first time in ancient India, under the Maurya dynasty, we tried to establish political and cultural unity
 baad main chalakar satvaahan vansh ne is prayaas ko aage badhaayaa
 Although historians Satavahanas are the successors of the Mauryas in the Deccan, the rise of this dynasty should also be understood as a normal Jain and Hindu process against the Buddhist kingdom of Ashoka
 satvaahan vansh kii sthapana maury vansh ke paraabhav se lagbhag pachaas varsh pehle hui
 His empire was the oldest and largest empire in South India
 uttar bharat nirantar badalte rajvansheey paridrishy ke viparit satvahanon ne dakkan main atoot, avibhajya tathaa dirghakaal tak sthai rup se chalane vaale ek samrajya kii sthapana kii jisane lagbhag saadhe chaar sau varshon tak shashan kiya
 From the information we have received about this period, we get to know about the singularities of the Satavahanas and their unique activities in different fields
 yadi puraanon ke vaktavyon par vishvas kiya jaae to dakkan ke is samrajya kii simaaen uttar bharat tak faili hui thi
 Magadha was a part of this empire, also spread over southern India and its boundaries were wide from eastern to western sea
 uttar tathaa dakshin bharat kii maalav, bhoj, pathnik, rathik, andhra, parind tathaa dravid aadi vibhinn prakaar kii prajatiyon ke samanvay se is samrajya kaa nirmaan hua tha tathaa is drushti se kshetrafal main maury samrajya se kam hote hue bhi satvaahan samrajya usase kahin adhik sugathit tha
 It was a result of the long and peaceful rule given by the Satavahanas in Central India and Deccan that the art and architecture developed, examples of which we can find in the sculpted cavities in the rocks of western India and the stupas and viharas of eastern India
 is kaal main samskruti kaa bhi atyadhik vikaas hua tathaa prakrut bhashaa kaa aakarshan rajdarbaron tak pahunchaa
 Although the Satavahana kingdom was a Hindu kingdom, Buddhism developed uniquely under them
 vyapaar, vaanijya evam jal parivahan ke kshetron main bhi atyaadhik unnati hui
 There is a complete lack of information and sources giving information about the Satavahanas
 unase sambandhit shilalekhon kii sankhya bahut kam he or is prastut shilalekhon main die gaye sandarbhon main bhi satvahanon ke vishay main purna jaankaree nahi milti
 About them we have only nineteen inscriptions from the eastern Deccan
 jo is vansh ke tees raajaaon tathaa saadhe chaar sau varshon ke lambe shashan kaal ke vishay main jaankaree dene ke liye kisi bhi drushtikon se prayog nahi he
 Although the Archaeological Department carried out excavations at Paithan, Maski and Pondapur in the ancient Hyderabad state, but no more evidence was found from here
 is vishay main satvaahan vashan ke raajaaon dwaara prachlit sikke jo purvi tathaa pashchimi dakkan evam madhya pradesh se mili hai, se hamen is vansh ke vishay main mahatvapurn jaankaree milti he
 Scholars like Thomas, Rapson, Cunningham, Bhagwan Lal Indra Ji and Scott have received important information from these coins
 parantu in sikkon ke bhangit tathaa kuch sikkon ke jaali hone ke kaaran kai vivaad uth khadey hue hai
 Literary sources have disappointed even more in this subject
