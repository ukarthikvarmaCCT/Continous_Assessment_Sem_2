 This article has been translated from this edition of the Wikipedia article Pythagorean theorem
 pithagoras prameya eucalidia jyamiti main kisi samakon tribhuj ke teenon bhujaaon ke bich ek sambandh bataane vaala prameya he
 This theorem is usually expressed as an equation in the following way- jahaan c samakon tribhuj ke karn kii lambaai he tathaa a or b anya do bhujaaon kii lambaai he
 Pythagoras was a Greek mathematician
 paramparanusaar unhen hi is prameya kii khoj kaa shrey diya jaataa he, haalanki yah mana jane laga he ki is prameya kii jaankaree unase purv tithi kii he
 This theorem is given in the ancient Indian Buddhist Buddhist Shulbasutra
 kaaphi pramaan he ki babylon ke ganitagyon bhi is siddhant ko jaanate the
 It is also called 'boudhayan-pythagoras theorem'
 agar ham karn kii lambaai ko c or anya do bhujaaon kii lambaai ko a or b lete hai, to prameya ko nimnlikhit sameekaran ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he: or, yadi c pehle se diya gaya he or ek bhujaa kii lambaai nikaalnaa ho, to nimnlikhit sameekaran kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he : or yah sameekaran samakon trikon ke teenon bhujaaon ke bich ek saral sambandh pradaan karata he
 The generalization of this theorem is called the 'cosine rule', with the help of which the length of the third side of any triangle can be calculated if the length of the remaining two sides and the angle between them is measured
 yah ek aisa prameya he jiske anya pramayon kii tulana main sambhavtah sarvaadhik pramaan gyaat hai

 boudhayan prameya ke adhikansh pramaanon kii tarah, yah do samroop tribhujon kii bhujaaon ke samaanupati hone ke gun par aadhaarit he
 Let ABC be a right angled triangle, in which angle c is right angled, as shown in the figure
 ham c bindu se karn par lamb daalate hai or bhujaa AB ke saath us lamb kii lambaai h hai
 This new triangle ACH is similar to our triangle ABC, because they both have right angles and a is their angle
 iskaa matlab he kii teesraa kone bhi donon tribhujon main samaan he
 On this basis, triangle CBH is also similar to ABC
 in samarupataaon se hamen do samaanupaat praapt hote hai: like tathaa They can also be written as in do samikarnon kaa sankshep karne par, In other words, the Boudhayan theorem: euclid ke tatwon main, pustak 1 kaa prastaav 47, boudhayan prameya nimnlikhit linon ke saath ek tark se sabit hota he
 A, B, c are considered the vertices of the right triangle, in which the right angle will be on A
 Drop a perpendicular from a to Karna opposite the square at the hypotenuse
 The line divides the square at the hypotenuse into two imports, each having the same area as one of the two legs being square
 aupchaarik pramaan ke liye, hamen chaar praathmik lemmata kii aavashyaktaa he: The simple idea behind this proof, which can make it easy to follow, is that the two squares above are transformed into a parallelogram of the same size, then folded and the left and right rectangles are converted to the lower squares, then continuous
 In area

 james e
 garfield ko ek upanyaas bijiy pramaan dwaara shrey diya gaya he: The entire trapezium is half of the left square, so its area = 2 / 2 = a2 / 2 + b2 / 2 + ab
 trikon 1 or trikon 2 prayek kshetrafal ab / 2 he
 The area of triangle 3 is c2 / 2 and it is half of the square on the hypotenuse
 lekin trikon 3 kaa kshetrafal bhi = - Hence the square on the hypotenuse = the sum of the squares of the other two sides
 is pramaan main, karn par varg plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan ko anya do parshvon main virgon ke rup main jod sakate hai plus trikon kii 4 pratiyaan
yah pramaan china se darj kii gai he
 From Euclid's proof diagram above, we can see three identical figures, each with a "triangle over a square"
 kyunki bada trikon do chote trikon se bana he, uskaa kshetrafal in do chote kaa jod he
 By analogy, the three squares are in the same ratio with each other as the three triangles and the area of the larger square is the sum of the area of the two smaller squares
 viparyay se pramaan ko chithran or anemeshan ke dwaara diya gaya he
 In this example, the area of each large square is 2
 donon main, charon samaan trikon kaa kshetrafal hataa diya gaya he
 The remaining regions, a2 + b2 and c2, are equal
 Q
E
D This proof is indeed very simple, but it is not preliminary, in the sense that it does not depend only on the most basic theory and theorems of Euclidean geometry
 vishesh rup se, jab trikon or virgon ke kshetrafal kaa sutara dena bahut aasaan he, yah sabit karne ke liye aasaan nahin he ki ek varg kaa kshetrafal uske tukdon ke kshetron kaa jod he
 In fact, proving the necessary properties is harder than proving the Pythagorean theorem
 In fact, this difficulty affects all simple field-involved Euclidean proofs; For example, to get the area of a right-angled triangle involves an assumption that it is half the area of a rectangle of the same height and plane
 isi kaaran se, jyamiti ke liye swayansiddh parichay aam taur par trikon kii samanta ke aadhaar par ek or pramaan kaa prayog karata he 
 In the third graphic illustration of this Pythagorean theorem, the square of the hypotenuse fits the square of the sides
 ek sambandhit pramaan yah dikhaa saktaa he kii punah sthapit bhaag mul ke samaan hai or, kyunki samaan kaa jod samaan he, kii unke kshetra bhi samaan hai
 To show that a square is the result, we have to show the length of the new sides equal to c
 Note that for this proof to work, we need to handle the way to cut a smaller square into more parts
 As the sides become smaller and smaller
 is pramaan kaa bijiy bhinnrup nimna tark dwaara pradaan kiya gaya he
 Looking at the illustration which is a large square with equal right-angled triangles at the corners, the area of each of these four triangles is given by an angle with C
 in trikon ke A-parshv kone or B-parshv kone anupoorak kone hai, nile kshetra ke prayek kone samakon hai, is kshetra ko ek varg banaate hue jiske parshv kii lambaai c he
 The area of this square is C2
 In this way the area of the whole is given: haalanki, bade varg ke parshvon kii lambaai a + B, ham uske kshetrafal kii gananaa kar sakate hai jaise 2, jo A2 + 2AB + B2 main vistaarit hota he
 The Buddhist theorem can be arrived at by studying the following diagram of how a lateral change can produce a change in the hypotenuse and using a small algorithm
 parshv a ke da main parivartan ke parinaam swarup, For a change in the similarity and difference of a triangle
 char ke viyojan par
 The result is the addition of a second term to the change in side b
 samekit detaa he When a = 0 then c = b, then b2 is "continuous"
 isliye As can be seen, this square is due to the special ratio between the changes and the sides, whereas the independent contribution of changes to the sides is the result of an amount that is not clear from geometric proofs
 is die gaye anupaat se yah dikhaaya ja saktaa he kii parshvon main parivartan parshvon se pratipanupati anupaat hai
 This differential equation suggests that this theorem is due to the related transform and its derivation is almost identical to the line integral computation
 yah maatra da or dc kramshah a or c main atyant chote parivartan hai
 But we use the real numbers Δa and Δc instead, then the ratio of their ratio is da / dc when their size is zero proximity, derivative and c / a are also close, the ratio of the length of the sides of the triangle and the result of the differential equation
 It shows
 is prameya kaa viparyaay bhi sach he: For any three positive numbers a, b and c such that a2 + b2 = c2, there exists a triangle whose sides are a, b and c and every triangle has a right angle between the sides whose lengths are a and b
 yah viparyaay euclid ke tatwon main maujuud hota he
 This can be proved by using the cosine method, or by the following proof: ABC ko ek trikon maanate hai jiske parshvon kii lambaai a, b or c he, a2 + b2 = c2 ke saath
hamen yah sabit karnaa he ki a or b parshvon ke bich ke kone samakon he
 We construct another triangle in which there is a right angle between the sides whose length is a and b
 paaythagorian prameya se, nimnanusaar he ki is trikon ke karn lambaai bhi c he
 Since the sides of the two triangles have the same length, a, b and c, they are congruent and therefore must have the same angle
 Therefore, the sides that have length a and b in our original triangle have a right angle between them
 paaythagorian prameya ke viparyaay kaa ek anumaan he kii nirdhaaran karne kaa ek saral tarika he kii yadi ek trikon samakon, obtyus, yaa acute he, is prakaar se
jahaan c ko teenon parshvon main lanbaa chunaa gaya he: a Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a, b and c, such as a2 + b2 = c2
 In other words, a Pythagorean triple describes the length of the sides of a right angle where the integer length of all three sides is

 Such triples are commonly written
 Some famous examples are and ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, , One of the results of the Pythagorean theorem is that the unstructured length, such as the square root of 2, can be constructed

 boudhayan prameya, parshvon kii lambaai se sambandhit adhik saamaanya prameya kaa ek vishesh cese he, kosine kii vidhi: If two vectors v and w are given in this complex inner product space, then the Buddhism theorem takes the following form: vishesh rup se,||v + w||2 =||v||2 +||w||2 agar v or w ayty hai, haalanki viparyaay kaa sach hona zaruri nahin he
 Using mathematical induction, the previous result can be extended to a rectangular vector in a finite number of pairs

 Edsjar Dijkstra calls this proposal about the Akyut, right-angled and obtuse triangles in this language: jahaan kone α parshv a ke vipareet he, kone β parshv b ke vipareet he or kone γ parshv c ke vipareet he
 The theory of Euclidean geometry derives from the Pythagorean theorem, in fact, the Euclidean type of the Pythagorean theorem stated above does not occur without Euclidean geometry

 Using the mclaurin series for this cosine function, it can be shown that the radius r reaches infinity, as it is, the spherical form of the Pythagorean theorem approaches the Euclidean form

 The Pythagoras formula is used to find the distance between two digits in a Cartesian coordinate plane and is valid if all the coordinates are real: digits {2 + 2)
 But with complex coordinates: examples, digits {and {i The distance between, 0} will remain zero, which results in redactio ad Absurdum
 This is because this formula relies on the theorem of Pythagoras, which in his Huss proofs, depends on the area
 Is su and the area depends on the triangle and on other geometric figures that separate the inside from outside, which would not have been possible if the coordinates were complex

 Currently, the adult, gambling, and retail industries are the most active areas of affiliate marketing

 These areas are followed by entertainment and Internet related services
 iske alaava kai sambhddha samaadhaan pradaankartaaon ko vyapaar-se-vyapaar vipanakon evam vigyaapan daataaon se sambhddha vipanan kaa prayog karte huye aay main badhottaree kii aashaa he
 Websites and services based on Web 2
0 principles - eg blogging and interactive online communities have also had an impact on the affiliate marketing world
 naye media ne vyapaariyon ko unke sambandhon ke najadik aane kii evam unke madhya sampreshan main sudhaar kii suvidha pradaan kii he
 Today eighty percent of affiliate programs use revenue sharing or cost per sale) as a compensation method, nineteen percent use other methods such as cost per click) or other methods such as cost per click) or cost per mile)
 adhik paripakv bazaaron main, ek pratishat se kam paramparaagat sambhddha vipanan program vartmaan main laagat prati clic ) evam laagat prati mile ) kaa prayog karte hai
 However, these compensation methods are being used in large quantities in display advertising and paid search
 laagat prati mile hetu keval yah aavashyak he ki prakaashak apni website par vigyaapan uplabdh karaaye evam ise aagantukon hetu pradarshit kare taaki kamishan praapt ho sake
 laagat prati clic main ek prakaashak ke liye munafa kamaane kii roopaantar prakriya main ek atirikt kadam kii aavashyaktaa hoti he : ek aagatuk ko keval ek vigyaapan ke prati jaagruk banane kii hi aavashyaktaa nahin he varan vah prakaashak kii website par bhraman hetu vigyaapan par clic bhi karnaa zaruri he
 Cost per click was generally more prevalent in the early days of affiliate marketing, but over time it became less used as fraudulent click cases were visible, such as click fraud cases currently appearing in modern search engines
 sanderbhit vigyaapan prograamon ko laagat prati clic ke ghatate prayog ke kaaran sankhyikee main shaamil nahin kiya gaya he, kyonki yah anishchit he ki sanderbhit vigyaapan ko sambhddha vipanan mana ja saktaa he
 Although these models have diminished in mature e-commerce and online advertising markets, they are still prevalent in some nascent industries
 china ek udhaaharan he, jahaan sambhddha vipanan pashchim ke isi model se mail nahin khaataa
 kai sambandhon ko "laagat prati din" kii dar se bhugtan ho rahaa he tathaa kuch network laagat prati clic yaa sipiem pradaan kar rahe hai
 In terms of cost per mile / click, the publisher, being an audience member, is not concerned about a visitor that the advertiser tries to attract and is successful in converting, because by this time the publisher has received their commission Has done
 isse vigyapandaata ko adhik tathaa laagat prati mile ke maamle main purna jokhim evam nuksaan uthaanaa padataa he 
 In cost per action / sales methods, the affiliate has to work in addition to visiting the visitor on the advertiser's website to get commission
 vigyapandaata ko sarvapratham aagatuk ko roopantarit karnaa hoga
 yah sambhddha ke sarvaadhik hit main he ki vah vigyapandaata tak sabase nazadiiki rup se lakshith yatayaat ko bheje taaki roopantaran kii sambhaavna main vruddhi ho sake
 isamen sambhddha evam vigyapandaata ke madhya jokhim or nuksaan kaa samaan vitaran hota he
 Affiliate marketing is also called "performance marketing", especially in relation to providing compensation to sales personnel
 These personnel are paid a commission for each of their sales and sometimes they are also given performance incentives once they meet the targets
 sambandhon ko vigyapandaata dwaara unke utpaada or sevaaon ke protsaahan hetu rojgaar pradaan nahin kiya jaataa, lekin sambhddha vipanan main lagu kshatipurti model vigyapandaata ke aantarik vikray vibhaag ke vyaktiyon ke prayog se kaaphi samaan he
 The saying "affiliates are an extended selling power for your business", often used to explain affiliate marketing, is not entirely accurate
 in donon ke madhya praathmik antar yah he ki vigyapandaata kii website par kisi bhi sambhavit graahak ke nirdeshit hone par uski roopantaran prakriya par sambhddha vipanak bahut kam prabhaav daalata he
 The sales team of the advertiser, however, has control and influence over the potential customer until he signs or completes the contract
 kuch vigyapandaata multi tear program prastaavit karte hai jo ki sin-ap evam up-partneron ke padanukramaanusaar sanderbhit network main kamishan kaa vitaran karata he
 In practical terms, publisher "A" signs up to an advertiser's program and is rewarded for the agreed activity conducted by the referring visitor
 yadi prakaashak "e" apane sin-ap code kaa prayog karte hue usee program main prakaashak "bi" or "si" ko aakarshith karata he, to prakaashak "bi" evam "si" kii bhavishya kii samast gatividhiyaan prakaashak "e" ko atirikt kamishan pradaan karengi
 Very few affiliate programs exist in two-tier programs, most are one-tier
 dwi-tear se pare sanderbhit program multi level vipanan ) yaa network vipanan se milte julate hai parantu inamen antar he
 Multi-level marketing) or network marketing have more eligibility / requirements to receive commission payments
 jabaki sambhddha prograamon main nahin
 Merchants support affiliate marketing because in most cases it uses the "pay for execution" ideal, which means that the merchant does not spend marketing until they produce results
 kai vyapaar samooh safalataa kaa adhiktam shrey is vipanan takanic ko dete he, jiskaa mashhoor udhaaharan Amazon

 Unlike display advertising, though, affiliate marketing is not easily scalable
 kuch vyapaaree lokapriy software kaa prayog karte hue swayan hi sambhddha program sanchalit karte hai jabaki anya sambandhon dwaara sanderbhit yatayaat athwa vikray ko trek karne ke liye bichauliyon dwaara pradaan kii gai tisare paksh kii sevaaon kaa prayog karte hai 
 vyapaaree do vibhinn prakaar ke sambhddha prabandhan samaadhaanon main se chunaav kar sakate hai: stand alon software athwa hosted sevaayen, jise mukhya rup se sambhddha network kehete hai
 Payments to affiliates or publishers are made by the network either on behalf of the merchant to all merchants, where the publisher has a relationship and earned a commission, or by the merchant himself
 safal sambhddha prograamon ko mahatvapurn kaary tathaa anurakshan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Successful affiliate programs are more difficult to maintain, rather than when these programs are in the initial state
 kuch lambavat bazaaron ke apwaad ke alaava, sambhddha program ke liye yah shaayad hi hoga vah kamjor prabandhan athwa prabandhan ke bina paryaapt puunji kaa srijan kar sake
 Uncontrolled affiliate programs have assisted and continue to be such insidious affiliates that carry out spamming, trade mark violations, false advertising, "cookie cutting", use of typo squatting and other unethical actions that negatively affect affiliate marketing Give prestige

 In a busy market filled with the same quality and size, the trader has difficulty in making profit and being recognized separately

 Recently, the internet marketing industry has become more modern

 There are many important requirements that traders must fulfill to be successful, and these requirements are becoming very cumbersome for traders to fulfill in-house

 Currently there is no industry-accepted standard for classification
 nimnlikhit prakaar kii web site saamaanya hoti he, lekin phir bhi sambhddha vyapaariyon dwaara saadhaaran rup se samajhi tathaa prayog kii jaati hai
 Affiliate networks, which already have many publishers, also have a growing group of publishers
 yah prakaashak sambhavya rup se niyukt kiye gayi hai, tathaa yah bhi sambhaavna he ki network ke prakaashak vigyaapan daataaon ke dwaara niyukti ke prayaas kii aavashyaktaa ke bina swayan hi program main aavedan karen
 The relevant website, which attracts the same target audience as the advertiser, but without competition, has potential affiliate partners
 vanders athwa vartmaan graahak bhi chaynit ho sakate hai, yadi yah karne se kuch phayda ho tathaa kisi kanoon tathaa niyamon kaa ulanghan na hota ho
 Often any web site can be selected as an affiliate publisher, although it is more likely that more busy websites are engaged in low-risk cost per mile or medium-risk cost per click transaction with high-risk cost per action or May be interested in comparing the revenue share deal
 kisi lakshith web site ke liye sambhddha program ke sthaan kaa pataa lagane ke liye pramukh rup se teen maarg hai: If the above sites do not provide information about the affiliate then it may be a non-public affiliate program
 The best way to get this information is to contact the website owner directly
 sambhddha vipanan kii utpatti ke samay se sambhddha kriyaaon ke upar thodaa hi niyantran he
 Spam, false advertisements, artificial clicks, adware and other methods have been used by unscrupulous affiliates to increase the burden on their sponsors
 yadhyapi kai sambhddha prograamon kii seva kii sharton main spalm ke viruddh niyam nihit hote he, aitihaasik rup se yah vipanan vidhi spamars dwaara galat gatividhiyon ko aakarshith karne vaali siddh hui he
 In the early period of affiliate marketing many internet users had negative opinions about it because affiliates often used spam to promote their nominated programs
 jaise - jaise sambhddha vipanan majboot hua he, kai sambhddha vyapaariyon ne sambandhon ko spaming se varjit karne ke liye apane niyam evam sharten parishkrut kii hai
 As search engines became more important, some affiliate marketers have shifted from sending e-mail spam to creating automatically generated web pages that often contain product data feeds provided by merchants
 is prakaar ke web pejej kaa lakshya spalm dexing ke naam se gyaat search ingine dwaara index kiye gayi sansadhano kii praasangikta athwa vishistataa main pherbadal karnaa hota he
 Each page can be targeted to different better markets by using specific keywords that result in an odd type of search engine optimization

 Google's pagerank algorithm update in 2006 - The last phase of the Google major update, which began in mid-summer 2005, aimed specifically at spamdexing with huge success
 is apadet se google apane index se adhiktar computer-srujit dohari saamagree ko hataane main sakasham hua
 Most of the web sites that contained affiliate links had a negative reputation in the past for short supply of quality content
 2005 main, google ne isamen prabhavi parivartan kiye, jisamen kuch web citon ko "kamjor-sambhddha" ankit kiya gaya tha
 Such web sites were either removed from Google's index or reinstalled in the results page
 To avoid this classification, affiliate marketer web masters should create quality content on their website that can differentiate between their work and the work of spammers or banner farms, which are only a medium of contact for merchants' sites
 kuch udghoshkon ne mul rup se suzav diya tha ki sambandhon ke link web site main hi nihit soochna ke sandarbh main acha kaary karte hai
 For example, if a web site contains information about a website publication, then the relevant link to the Internet service provider will be appropriate in the content of the merchant's website
 If a website contains information related to sports, then any relevant link about sports, in relation to sports items and information can do good work
 is maamle main lakshya website main hi gunvatttapurna soochna ko prakashit karnaa tathaa sambandhit vyapaariyon kii website ko sandarbhonmukh link pradaan karnaa hota he
 However, the more recent example is of weak - affiliate sites that are using affiliate marketing model to create value for consumers by providing services
 ye kamjor saamagree seva sambhddha nimnlikhit teen shreniyon main vargeekrut hai: Although it is different from spyware, adware uses the same methods and technologies
 vyapaaree prarambh main edwear se anjaan the ki uskaa kya prabhaav hoga tathaa yah unke brand ko kitna nuksaan karegaa
 sambhddha vipanak is masale ko jald hi jaan gayi, vishesh rup se is kaaran se, ki unhone paaya ki edwear trekking kukies par praayah punah lekhan karata he jisase kamishan main kami aati he
 Affiliates not implementing adware found it stealing commissions from them
 praayah edwear kaa koi mahatvapurn uddeshy nahin hota, tathaa yah upabhokta ko shaayad hi upyogi saamagree pradaan karata he, jo vishesh rup se anjaan hota he ki is tarah kaa software unke computer main sthapit he
 Affiliates discussed the issues in Internet forums and started organizing efforts
 unhone vishwaas kiya ki is samasya se mukti paane kaa sabase acha tarika edwear ke madhyam se vyapaariyon ke vigyaapan karne ko nirutsahit kiya jaye
 ve vyapaaree jo edwear ke prati udasin yaa uske samarthak the, unhen sambandhon ne anaavruth kar diya, jisase un vyapaariyon kii pratishtha ko nuksaan pahunchaa tathaa unke sambhddha vipanan prayaason ko dhakka laga
 kai sambandhon ne yaa to aise vyapaariyon kaa upyog samaapt kar diya athwa pratiyogi ke sambhddha program se jud gayi
 Ultimately, affiliate networks were pressurized by merchants and affiliates to take appropriate measures and ban certain adware publishers from their networks
 iskaa parinaam kamishan jankshan / bi free tathaa pararfamics dwaara aachaar samhita, link share kaa hinsa rodhi vigyaapan parishisht, tathaa share e cells kaa vigyaapan ofer ko protsaahan dene ke liye sambandhon ke liye madhyam ke rup main software aplications kaa purna pratibandh tha
 Despite the progress, adware continues to be an issue, as demonstrated by a class action lawsuit filed on April 20, 2007 against Value Click and its affiliate company Commission Junction
 sambhddha, bhugtan prati clic vigyaapan ko sabase pehle apnaane waalon main se the jab pehla bhugtan prati clic search ingine 1990 ke dashak ke ant main ubhar kar saamne aayaa
 In late 2000, Google launched its pay-per-click service,], which is responsible for the widespread use and acceptance of pay-per-click as an advertising channel

 Although this stand-alone situation has led to ad channel conflict and debate among advertisers and affiliates, the biggest issue was related to the advertisers' names, brands, and the associated bid of the trademarks
 kai vigyaapan daataaon ne us prakaar ke kiwards par boli lagane se unke sambandhon ko rokane ke liye apni sambhddha program sharton ko samyojit karnaa shuru kar diya
 kuch vigyapandaataaon ne, haalanki, is vyavhaar ko sweekrut kiya he tathaa abhi bhi kar rahe hai, yahan tak ki ve sambandhon ko vigyapandaata ke trademarkon par boli lagane kii anumati balki protsaahan pradaan kar rahe hai
 Affiliate marketing is run by entrepreneurs who are working in the era of internet marketing
 sambhddha ubharne vaale trand tathaa praudyogikiyon kaa laabh lene waalon main praayah sabase agrani hote hai
 "trial and error" is the best way to describe operational methods for affiliate marketers
 yah jokhim bharaa tarika ek kaaran ho saktaa he ki kyon adhiktar sambhddha, jo US$ 10,000 athwa adhik kaa kamishan prati maah srujit karne kii kshamta rakhane vaale "super sambhddha" banane ke pehle hi asafal ho jate hai athwa prayaas band kar dete hai
 This frontier life combined with the behavior found in such communities is perhaps the main reason why the affiliate marketing industry is unable to self-regulate between advertisers and affiliates beyond personal contracts
 sambhddha vipanan ne kuch prakaar ke udyog sanghathan athwa sangh ko nirmit karne ke liye kai asafal prayaason kaa anubhav kiya he jo udyog ke liye niyamanon, maanakon tathaa disha nirdeshon kaa prarambhk ho saktaa he
 Associated unions and IAFMA are some examples of unsuccessful regulation efforts

 Online forums are free, able to provide big voice to small affiliates and provide anonymity

 The most recent example of such success was the break of the "commission Junction Link Management Initiative" in June / July 2006 when single networks attempted to impose the use of javascript tracking code on their affiliates as a replacement for simple HTML

 There are some courses and seminars that result in certification; However, acceptance of such attestation is mostly due to the reputation of the attesting person or company

 The Code of Conduct was issued by the Affiliate Network Commission Junction / b Free and Performics in December 2002 to direct practices for online advertising and adhere to ethics standards
 laagat prati kaary kon "clasik" sambhddha vipanan network ke liye khatre ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Traditional affiliate marketing is resource-intensive and requires constant maintenance
 adhiktar rakh-rakhaav main vyavasthaapan, nirikshan tathaa sambandhon ko sahyog pradaan karnaa sammilit he
 The goal of affiliate marketing is directed towards long-term and mutually beneficial partnerships between advertisers and affiliates
 laagat prati kaary network yadhyapi, sambandhon ke saath vigyapandaata ke sambandh banane tathaa use banaae rakhane kii aavashyaktaa ko samaapt karata he, kyonki vah kaary vigyapandaata ke liye laagat prati kaary network dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The advertiser makes an offer, most always cpa-based and cost-per-action networks handle the rest of the process by organizing their affiliates to encourage that offer
 laagat prati vikray tathaa rajasav saajhedaari clasik sambhddha vipanan ke liye pramukh kshatipurti model hote hai, tathaa ye shaayad hi laagat prati kaary network main paae jate hai
 Affiliate marketers typically avoid the cost per action network title; However, if this is discussed, debates can be hot and explosive
 vipanan udyog ke sadsy sanstut kar rahe hai ki "sambhddha vipanan" ko kisi vaikalpik naam se pratisthapit karnaa chaiye
 Affiliate marketing is often considered network marketing or multi-level marketing
 nishpaadan vipanan ek saamaanya vikalp he, parantu anya siforishein bhi kii gai hai
 In April 2008, the State of New York included an item in the state budget emphasizing sales tax jurisdiction over sales made by amazondotcom to New York residents based on the existence of links to Amazon's New York-based website
 The state claims that any single affiliate that constitutes Amazon's business in the state is sufficient to tax all sales of Amazon in New York to state residents

" saraswati ek puranic nadi jisaki charchaa vedon main bhi he
 The Rigveda describes Saraswati as Annavati and Udkavati
 yah nadi sarvada jal se bhari rahati thi or iske kinare ann kii prachur utpatti hoti thi
 It is said that this river, originating from the mountainous part of Sirmur state in Punjab and passing through Ambala and Kurukshetra, entered the Karnal district and Patiala state and merged with the Drishadvati river in Sirsa district
 pracheen kaal main is sammilit nadi ne raajapootaana ke anek sthalon ko jalsikt kar diya tha
 It is also said that this shape up to near Prayag became a triveni in the Ganges and Yamuna
 kalantar main yah in sab sthanon se tirohit ho gai, phir bhi logon kii dharna he ki prayag main vah ab bhi ant:salila hokar bahati he
 It is clear from Manushahita that the terrain between Saraswati and Drishdwati was called Brahmavarta
 saraswati nadi puranic hindu granthon tathaa rugveda main varnit mukhya nadiyon main se ek he
 a Mantra of the river Sukta of the Rigveda describes the river Saraswati as flowing 'east of the Yamuna' and 'west of the Sutlej'
 In the later Vedic texts, such as the Tandayas and the Jaiminiya Brahmana, the Saraswati river is described as dry in the desert, in the Mahabharata
 There is also a description of the extinction at a place called 'vinashan' in the desert of Saraswati river
 mahabharat main saraswati nadi ke plakshavati nadi, vedasmriti, vedavati aadi kai naam hai
 In the Mahabharata, Vayupurana etc
 the names and myths associated with various sons of Saraswati are obtained
 mahabharat ke shalya-parv, shanti-parv, yaa vayupurana main saraswati nadi or dadhichi rishi ke putr sambandhi myth thode thode antaron se milte hai unhen sanskrit mahakavi banbhatta ne apane granth 'harshcharit' main vistaar de diya he
 He writes- "once the rains did not happen for twelve years, the sages abandoned the area of saraswati and moved here and there, but Saraswati-son, Saraswatiya did not go anywhere on the orders of Mother
 phir sukaal hone par jab tak ve rishi waapas laute to ve sab veda aadi bhul chuke the
 Keeping his request, Saraswati accepted him as a disciple and got him to recite the Shrutis
 Ashwaghosh has also described the same story in his 'buddhacharit' poetry
 dasvin sadi ke jane maane vidwaan rajasekhar ne 'kavyamimasaa' ke tisare adhyay main kavy sambandhi ek myth diya he ki jab putr prapti kii ichha se saraswati ne himalay par tapasya kii to brahma ne prasann ho kar uske liye ek putr kii rachana kii jiskaa naam tha- kavypurush
 kavypurush ne janm leti hi mata saraswati kii vandana chand vaani main yon kii- he mata!main tera putr kavypurush teri charan vandana karata hoon jiske dwaara samoochaa vaanmay arthrup main parivartit ho jaataa he
 

 " rugveda tathaa anya puranic vaidic granthon main diye saraswati nadi ke sandarbhon ke aadhaar par kai bhu-vigyaani maanate hai ki haryana se rajasthan hokar bahane vaali maujuuda sukhi hui ghagghar-hakaraa nadi pracheen vaidic saraswati nadi kii ek mukhya sahaayak nadi thi, jo 5000-3000 isa purv puure pravaah se bahati thi
 At that time some streams of Sutlej and Yamuna used to come in Saraswati river
 iske atirikt do anya lupt hui nadiyaan drushtaavadi or hiranyavati bhi saraswati kii sahaayak nadiyaan thim, lagbhag 1900 isa purv tak bhugarbhi badlaav kii vajah se yamuna, sutluj ne apana rasta badal diya tathaa drushtaavadi nadi ke 2600 isa purv suukh jane ke kaaran saraswati nadi bhi lupt ho gayi
 In the Rig Veda, the river Saraswati has been given the title of Naditama
 vaidic sabhyataa main saraswati hi sabase badi or mukhya nadi thi
 Research done by ISRO has shown that this river still flows underground through Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan
 saraswati ek vishaal nadi thi
 The mountains used to break and go through the plains and merge into the Arabian Sea
 iskaa varnan rugveda main baar-baar aata he
 It is described in many circles
 rugveda vaidic kaal main isamen hameshaa jal rahata tha
 Saraswati, like today's Ganges, was one of the largest rivers of that time
 uttar vaidic kaal or mahabharat kaal main yah nadi bahut kuch suukh chuki thi
 Then the water in the Saraswati river was very less
 lekin barsaat ke mausam main isamen pani aa jaataa tha
 Due to the geological changes, the water of the river Saraswati went into the Ganges, many scholars believe that this is the reason why the water of the Ganges was glorified, due to the earthquake, when the land rose up, Saraswati water fell into the Yamuna
 isliye yamuna main saraswati kaa jal bhi pravaahit hone laga
 Only this is why the confluence of three rivers is considered in Prayag, whereas in reality there is no confluence of three rivers
 vahaan keval do nadiyaan hai
 Saraswati never reached Allahabad
 rugveda ke baad ke vaidic sahitya main saraswati nadi ke vilupt hone kaa ullekh aata he, iske atirikt saraswati nadi ke udgam sthal kii 'plaksh prasravan' ke rup main pahchaan kii gayi he, jo yamunotri ke paas hi avasthit he
 According to the description found in the Mahabharata, the Saraswati river originated from a place called Adibadri, slightly above Yamunanagar in Haryana and slightly below the Shivalik hills
 aaj bhi log is sthaan ko tirthasthal ke rup main maanate hai or vahaan jate hai
 But today the river flowing from a place called Adibadri does not go very far, it is called Saraswati, which is seen everywhere like a thin stream
 vaidic or mahabharat kaaleen varnan ke anusaar isi nadi ke kinare brahmavart tha, kurukshetra tha, lekin aaj vahaan jalashay hai
 When the river dries, the ponds or lakes remain wherever the water is deep, and these ponds and lakes are found in a crescent shape
 aaj bhi kurukshetra main brahmasarovar yaa pehwa main is prakaar ke ardhdachandrakaar sarovar dekhne ko milte hai, lekin ye bhi suukh gaye hai
 But these ponds are proof that there was a huge river flowing at that place and after it dried there were huge lakes
 bhartiya puraatatv parishad ke anusaar saraswati kaa udgam uttaranchal main rupan naam ke himand se hota tha
 Rupana Glacier is now also known as Saraswati Glacier
 naitvaar main aakar yah himand jal main parivartit ho jaataa tha, phir jaldhar ke rup main adibadri tak saraswati bahakar aati thi or aage chali jaati thi
 Scientific and geological discoveries have revealed that at some point there was a severe earthquake in the region, due to which the below ground mountains rose up and the water of Saraswati river went backwards
 vaidic kaal main ek or nadi drushadwati kaa varnan bhi aata hai
 It was a tributary of the Saraswati River
 yah bhi haryana se ho kar bahati thi
 Over a period of time when a severe earthquake struck and mountains rose above the ground of Haryana and Rajasthan, the direction of the rivers flow changed
 drushadwati nadi, jo saraswati nadi kii sahaayak nadi thi, uttar or purv kii ore bahane lagi
 This Darshadvati is now called Yamuna, its history is believed to be 4,000 years ago
 yamuna pehle chambal kii sahaayak nadi thi
 Much later it was found in Allahabad by going from the Ganges
 yahi vah kaal tha jab saraswati kaa jal bhi yamuna main mil gaya
 Saraswati used to fall into the sea in the Rigvedic period
 jaisaa upar bhi kaha ja chukaa he, prayag main saraswati kabhi nahin pahunchi

 There were talks with Tom Wilkinson to play Swan Governor, but the role was passed on to Jonathan Price, who Depp considered his role model

 It got its name from the place where the Constitutional House was constituted and it was there for the first time
 vaise germany kaa us samay aupchaarik naam german rikh hi tha
 After the First World War in November 1918, this republic was the product of the German Revolution
 san 1919 i
 main wimer main ek rashtriya sammelan yojit kiya gaya jahaan german rikh ke liye nayaa samvidhan likhaa gaya or usee varsh ke 11 agast ko apana liya gaya
 That period of liberal democracy had ended by the 1930s, which resulted in the rise of Adolf Hitler and his Natsi Party in 1933
 natsi party dwaara farvari se march 1933 ko jo kanoonee hathkande apanaaye gaye unhen saadharantah glikshalatung kaha jaataa he jiskaa arth tha ki sarkaar samvidhan ke vipareet bhi kaanoon bana sakati he
 The republic continued on paper until 1945 AD, because the constitution it had never formally abrogated, although the constitution had become irrelevant to the steps taken by the Natsis at the beginning of their reign
 yahi kaaran he ki san 1933 ko wimer kaa ant tathaa hitler kii teesri rikh kaa armbh mana jaataa he

 At the same time, the German communists wanted to establish a system of governance in the country in accordance with the Russian communist system, but they could not succeed
 ab fredrick abert kii sarkaar ne ek samvidhan nirmaan kii disha main kaary karnaa aarambh kiya or 19 janvari 1919 ko rashtriya samvidhan sabha ke nirvachan kii ghoshnaa kii jisamen kai raajnneetik dalon ne bhaag liya kintu kisi bhi dal ko spasht bahumat praapt nahin hua
 In this way, the first meeting of the 421-member Constituent Assembly was held on 5 February 1919 at a place called ']'
 samvidhan sabha ne fredrick abert ko ganatantr kaa pratham raashtrapati or philip shideman ko pradhanmantri banaaya
 After all the debate, a new constitution was created which is known as 'weimar Constitution'
 14 agast 1919 ko is samvidhan ko lagu kiya gaya
 1
 According to the new constitution, a republic of 18 federal states was established in Germany
 is shashan vyavastha main adhyakshatmak or sansadeey shashan pranali kii vyavastha kii gai
 2
 The German public was considered the source of state sovereignty and all men and women over 20 years of age were given the franchise
 3
 samvidhan ke anusaar karypalika kaa adhyaksha raashtrapati ko banaaya gaya, jisaki karyavadhi 7 varsh nirdhaarit kii gai
 Although the motion of no confidence was passed by the Members of Parliament by a special majority, it could also be removed prematurely
 4
 raashtrapati jal, thal, vayusena kaa pradhan senapati bhi hota tha
 He had the right to declare a state of emergency and get all rights in that situation
 5
 wimer samvidhan ne raashtrapati kii sahaayta or salaah dene ke liye ek mantriparishad kaa nirmaan kiya
 The head of the Council of Ministers will be the Prime Minister appointed by the President
 6
 samvidhan ke anusaar sansad ke do sadan rakhe gaye-pratham, nimna sadan yaa lok sabha rikhyatag, doosraa rajya parishad yaa rikhasrat kaha jaataa tha
 The Lok Sabha was elected on the basis of proportional representation system for 4 years

 The powers of this assembly were limited

 samvidhan sabha dwaara nagarikon ko vyaktigat swatantraaa bhaashan evam lekhan kii swatantraaa tathaa dharmik swatantraaa pradaan kii gai
 1
 The 48th section of the German Constitution was related to the crisis situation, under which there was a system of emergency declaration and the right to take over the authority of the President, by misusing this section, German President Heidenberg dug the tomb of democracy and Hitler to become Chancellor

 2
 The German President was elected directly
 atah vah bhi apane ko janata kaa sachch pratinidhi maanata tha or pradhanmantri se adhik shaktishaalee maanata tha
 3
 One shortcoming of the German constitution is also the proportional system of elections which increased the number of political parties in the country and always created mixed cabinets
 hitler ne bhi jab satta praapt kii to use janata kaa bahumat praapt nahin hua
 He formed his cabinet with the help of other parties
 4
 germany kaa samvidhan sangheey paddati kaa tha
 Therefore, states demanded more rights, this also affected the political situation of two
 1919 i
 main germany main jis ganatantr kii sthapana hui thi uske sthaan par germany kii janata ne keval 13 varshon ke baad hitler ke adhinayakawadi satta ko sweekaar kiya
 It is at this point that the question arises as to what were the reasons behind which the newly established republic proved to be short-lived
 ganatantr ke patan ke karkon ko ganatantr ke samaksh samasyaon ke alok main samajha janaa chahie- 1
 Signing of the offending treaty of Versailles: The Republic was established at a time when Germany was broken by military defeat and was forced to sign harsh and abusive terms
 is samvidhan ke tahat alsaas-lauren kaa kshetra france ko dena padaa tha, sena main kami kar di gai thi, ek badi raashi yuddh harjane ke rup main tay kii gai
 From this point of view the Republic was a symbol of humiliation of Germany from the beginning
 2
 bahudaleey vyavastha : germany main bahudaleey vyavastha thi or kisi bhi ek dal ko bahumat kabhi nahin mila
 Due to this, there was a mixed cabinet which could not remain ruling for long
 1919-1932 ke bich 18 sarkarein astitv main ai jo bahudaleey vyavastha main nihit avyavashtha kii suchak thim
 In such a situation no republican government could adopt a long-term program to solve the German problems
 bahumat kaa samarthan na hone ke kaaran praayah vahaan sankatkalin dhara 48 ke adhyadeshon dwaara shashan chalaanaa padaa tha
 Therefore, the German people were fed up with this republic and the republicans took advantage of it
 3
 aarthik sankat : navasthapit ganatantr ko vishwayudhjanit aarthik kathinaayeeyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, during World War I, the economic burden on Germany was increased
 yuddh ke baad uske kal-kaarkaane band ho gaye, niryaat vyapaar chaupat ho gaya tathaa berozegaron kii sankhya main jabardast vruddhi hui
 Along with this, huge amount of war compensation was imposed on Germany
 ganatantr kii sarkaar ne in samasyaon se nipatane ke ke kram main karon main vruddhi kii, videshon rin liye, kagaji mudra kii atyadhik prachlan kiya
 This led to the devaluation of the German currency 'mark', adversely affecting Germany's economic condition
 1929 ke vishwavyaapee mandi ke aarthik asantosh ko or zyada gaharaa diya
 These economic difficulties were seen by the German public by connecting them to the Weimar Republic
 faltah ve iske viruddh ho gaye or hitler ne is sthiti kii laabh uthaa ganatantr kaa patan kar diya
 4
 Foreign Policy of the Republic: After the Treaty of Versailles, the attitude of international politics towards Germany was separatist
 germany ko vibhinn desh shaq or avishvaas kii drushti se dekhte the
 Not only this, the French and Belgian armies took control of Germany's industrial area 'roor' under the guise of recovery of war compensation
 is tarah akushal videsh niti ke kaaran germany kaa apamaasana hota rahaa or iske liye ganatantr ko uttaradaayi mana gaya isliye jab hitler ne germany ke vistaar or antarrashtriya raajnneeti main pratishtha badhaane kii baat kii to german janata ne ise ankhon par bithaaya
