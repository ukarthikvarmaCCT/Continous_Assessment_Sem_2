 The Hoover Dam, once known as the Boulder Dam, is a concrete gravity-arc dam on the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, located between the borders of the US states of Arizona and Nevada
 When its construction was completed in 1936, it was the world's largest hydroelectric power generating station and the world's largest structure
 In 1945, the Grand Coulee Dam overtook it in both these cases
 It is today the 38th largest hydroelectric power generation in the world

 For the first time there was an attempt to get congressional approval under which two bills were proposed in the House of Representatives and Senate in 1922
 These bills were proposed by Congressman Phil D
 Swing and Senator Johnson W
 Hiram and became known as swing-johnson bills
 These bills failed to garner votes and were introduced several times later
 In December 1928, both the Houses and the Senate finally approved the bill and sent it to the President for approval
 On 21 December 1928, President Calvin Coolidge signed the bill and approved the Boulder Canyon Project
 Initial appropriation for the construction was made in July 1930, by which time Herbert Hoover had become president

 Six Companies, Inc
, was contracted to build a new township for workers, called Boulder City, but the scheduled construction work of the dam was expedited to create more jobs in response to the onset of the Great Depression and 1931
 The town could not be built until the construction of the dam started and the first hand of workers arrived
 During the first summer of the construction period, workers and their families were placed in makeshift camps such as Ragtown while the work in the town was in progress
 Dissatisfaction with working in a dangerous situation at Ragtown and the dam site led to a strike on 8 August 1931
 Six companies sent strike breakers armed with guns and lathis in response to this strike and the strike was soon put under control
 But this dissatisfaction prompted the authorities to speed up the construction work of Boulder City and by the spring of 1932 Ragtown was evacuated
 Gambling, drinking, and prostitution were not allowed in Boulder City during the period of construction
 Boulder City is one of the two places in Nevada where gambling is prohibited to date and where the sale of alcohol was illegal until 1969

 To protect the construction site from flooding, two Kofar dams were constructed
 The construction of the upper Kofarbandh began in September 1932, although the river flow had not been diverted until that time
 a makeshift horseshoe-shaped embankment protected the Koffer Dam from the Nevada-bound river
 After the completion of the Arizona tunnels and diverting the course of the river, the work was completed more quickly
 Once the Kofarbandh was built and the water at the dam construction site was removed, excavation was started for the dam
 In order for the dam to stay permanently on the rocks, it was necessary that the soil, erosive soil and other open matter at the bottom of the river be removed until solid rocky ground was found
 The foundation excavation was completed in June 1933
 During the excavation for the foundation, approximately 1,500,000 cubic yards of material were removed
 Since this dam will be of gravity-arc type, The adjacent walls of this valley will also handle the force of this blocked lake
 So the side walls were also excavated to reach virgin stones that had not experienced the effects of the rushing river for centuries, the cold carpet chatter and the hot / cold cycle of the arizona-nevada desert

 After the completion of the dam, the entrances to the tunnels with both external diversions were covered by huge concrete plugs from the start to the half tunnel
 Behind the inner plugs, the lower half of the tunnel is now the main section of the spillway tunnels

 The workers who removed the rock were called high-scalars
 When they were hung with the help of ropes from above the valley, the high-schoolers used to break loose rocks with the help of Jackhammer and Denamite by hanging down from the valley wall

 On Kaufmann's orders, Denver artist Alan Tupper True was inducted into the board to manage the drawing and decoration of the walls and floors of the new dam
 True envisaged incorporating the motifs of the Navajo and Pueblo tribes of that region
 Although some people were initially against these designs, True got permission to continue working and was officially appointed as a consulting artist
 With the help of the National Anthropological Laboratory, True researched the decorative motifs of Indian sand paintings, weaves, baskets and ceramics
 Drawings and colors are based on Native American perspectives such as rain, lightning, water, clouds, and some local animals — such as lizards, serpents, birds — and the staircase plateaus of the western landscape
 Among the artifacts collected in the walkways and inner halls of this massive dam, True, terrazo farsh par sannihit yah mul america roopankan, kisi vishaal tarabine ke pahiyon kii tarah dikhataa he, phir bhi ve spashtatya bhartiya america mul ke hai

 With the consent of the architect Kaufmann and engineers, Tru designed a variable color coding for pipes and machines that was implemented in all projects of the Bureau of Reclamation
 True's tenure as a consulting artist lasted after 1942 and was extended so that he could also complete the drawing work of the Parker, Shasta and Grand Coulee Dam
 At the time, True's work on the Boulder Dam was published in the New Yorker magazine as a humorously written poem, part of which was "loose the Spark, and Justify the Dream; But Olso Uniform of Remark will be the color scheme

 a group of special dump cars were built by Six Companies for use on the railroad, which proved to be helpful in construction
 Even today, one of them remains in the Western Pacific Railroad Museum in California, Portola
 The Western Pacific Railroad acquired several such cars to use in post-construction company operations

 On October 26, 1936, the dam's Hoover power plant generators began power transmission in Los Angeles, California, 266 miles from the Colorado River
 By 1961 additional manufacturing units were added
 According to the original plan, 16 large generators were to be installed, of which eight generators were to be installed on either side of the river, but one small generator was replaced by two smaller generators towards Arizona, bringing the total number of generators to 17
 Before the dam's total energy production was arbitrarily distributed by placing it on the grid, small generators were used to serve small municipalities when each generator was dedicated to producing one municipality Was panbizli vidyut sanyantron ke paas maang ke anusaar urja utpaadan pariman main pher badal karne kii kshamta hoti he
 bhaap tarabine urja sanyantr kii pranali main thermodainemic niskriyata kaa pariman hone ke kaaran use aasaani se niyantrit kiya janaa sambhav nahin hota he
 Water control was the primary concern in the construction of the dam
 Energy production made the dam project self-sufficient: by paying back 50-year construction loans and enabling it to continue paying the annual maintenance budget of multi-million dollars
 Energy is generated in phases, except water in response to the need to overflow water only
 beuro of ricklemeshan kii report ke anusaar utpann urja kaa aabantan is prakaar hota he: The dam is protected from top-down by spillways
 The entrance to the spillway is located behind each boundary of the dam, which runs roughly parallel to the canyon walls
 The entryway of the spillway makes an excellent one-way ridge which has four 100 ft long and 16 ft high steel drum gates in each spillway
 Each gate weighs 5 million pounds and can be manned or operated automatically
 The gates are raised or dropped depending on the water level of the reservoir and the flood situation
 These gates are unable to completely stop the entry of water into the spillway but they help in maintaining the water level of the reservoir up to an additional 16 feet
 spiluez ke upar se bahata pani, nirmaan pathantaran surangon ke saath judane se pehle yaa to 600 feet lambey, yaa 50 feet chaude spilve surangon main tezi se girtaa he or baandh ke neeche ke mukhya nadi maarg main punah pravesh karata he

 samgr spilve kshamta ko 1941 ke nirmaan pareekshanon main anubhavik taur par satyapit kiya gaya tha
 is pareekshan se yah bhi pataa chalaa ki oochch veg pravaah dwaara bane guhikayan se spilve surangon ko kshati pahunch sakati he, jab ve kareeb purna pariman main behate hai

 phir bhi, prayek spilve surang 200,000 ghan foot / second pravaah sambhaal saktaa he, jo niagra fuls ke pravaah ke samaan he
 The largest spillway tunnels have been used only twice in the dam's history
 In addition to testing in 1941, these spillways were used in the 1983 floods
 Spillway gates were used in 1999 to stop the water behind the dam, which was caused by an increase in the water level caused by heavy water logging in the Lake Meade watershed

 The Colorado River experienced natural flooding prior to the construction of the Hoover Dam
 The dam ended the natural floods, causing many species that had adapted to the floods, including both plants and animals, were endangered

 It serves as a crossing from Colorado River to US Highway Route 93
 There are many dangerous hairpin turns in the two-lane section of road leading to the dam and there is also the danger of slipping rocks

 Additionally, in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, there are intense concerns about security
 Because of the attack, the Hoover Dam bypass project was expedited
 Traffic across the Hoover Dam is currently restricted
 Some types of vehicles are checked before crossing the dam, while some vehicles, such as semi-trailer trucks, buses carrying goods, enclosed-box trucks of more than 40 feet are not allowed to pass through the dam
 Traffic is diverted to a bridge south of the Colorado River in Laughlin, Nevada

 Their caste is mainly in Bihar and western and northern India

 Shakdwitriya Brahmins were mainly from Magadha, hence they are also called Magh
 aaj bhi magadh ke aasapaas hi hai
 Two Brahmins of the Maga visited Jerusalem during the Vikramaditya period, which was then under Rome

 They are mentioned in the Vedas and Puranas as one of the best caste of Brahmins who were born from the share of Suryadev

 According to Veda Puranas, Sakdwini Brahmins originated from Surya and were as fast as Surya

 With this very subtle thought, they look at the Shakdwitriya Brahmin with inferiority

 He is a learned scholar of Sanskrit and in the Bhavishya Purana etc
 he has also been called a divine Brahmin

 Many scholars express their opinion on the arrival of the Shakadweepis to India that they came from Iran etc
 and deny the written things on their own Puranas
 bhagwaan krishna ne inhe shakadweep se jambudweep main laayaa tha, tab to iran bhi jambudweep kaa hissaa tha
 Myths are: Where did the continental come from? Even great scholars are ignoring the Shakdwip described in Vishnupurana and Shrimad Bhagwat Mahapuran etc
 to make themselves superior and look at the Shakadvipis with inferiority

 Adi languages are, by definition, envisaged languages, which have been reconstructed by linguists and hence historical records of any accustomed language are not available
 proto-dravidiyan ke maamle main bhi kuch aisa hi he
 Due to the lack of comparative linguistic research in Dravidian languages, more details about the grammar, era, or place of proto-dravidian are not known
 aisa mana jaataa he ki 500 isa purv ke aas paas proto-uttari dravidiyan, proto-kendriya dravidiyan or proto-dakshini dravidiyan ke bich vibhedan hua
 However some linguists argue that the degree of differentiation between its subclasses indicates an early division

 Here we will discuss the intuitive features of the reconstructed proto-dravidian language

 Cuisine: Proto Dravidian is reconstructed with the following consonants: vatsarya band dhwani*ṯ kai putree bhashaaon main vatsarya tril ke rup main viksit hota he
 The / r / off sound is still found in Kota and Toda
 The original closed sound is still found in repetition in Malayalam
 Old Tamil has a clearly pronounced vowel like other closed sounds

 The rhinoceros nasal developed in * ṅ Proto Dravidian before * k
 Hence it is not considered a distinct pronunciation in the Adya Dravidian

 Dravidian languages have been found mainly in southern India since the beginning of the Common Era

 The similarity of Dravidian languages with Brahui, a language spoken in Balochistan, Pakistan — which was once a part of the Indus Valley — is evident

 According to Michael Witzel, there are not many Dravidian words even in the early stages of the Vedas, even it can be said that the influence of the Dravidians increased rapidly in the post-rigvedic period
 Professor Vitzel in the essay "substrate Languages in Old indo-aryan" states, "because we cannot recognize the Dravidian influence on early rvs, it means that the language of the pre-rigvedic Indus civilization, at least in the punjab-austro- It was of Asiatic nature

 mendelian viraasat Mendelian heritage is a legacy of biological features that it was very controversial in 1865 and 1866, after the law proposed by Gregor Mendel Johansson and initially rediscovered in 1900
 mendel ke siddhanton 1915 main thomas hunt morgan dwaara viraasat kii Boveri-saton gunasutra ke siddhant ke saath ekikrut kiya gaya he, ve shastreey anuvanshiki ke kor jabaki ronaald fisher unhen apane 1930 kitaab prakritik chayan ke siddhant Genetical main prakritik chayan ke siddhant ke saath sanyukt ho gaya, ek ganitiya aadhaar par vikaas daal rahaa he or jansankhya anuvanshiki or aadhunik vikasvaadi sanshleshan ke liye aadhaar banane
 Rules of succession were obtained by Gregor Mendel, a nineteenth-century Austrian monk, and later by Prälet, who conducted hybridization experiments in the Garden Peas he planted in the church's backyard
 1856 or 1863 ke bich, vah kheti kii jaati he or kuch 5,000 matar ke paudhon kaa pareekshan kiya
 From these experiments, he inspired two generalizations that later came to be known as Mendel's theories of heredity or Mendelian heritage
 unhone kaha ki ek do bhaag kaagaj, Versuche Über pflanzen-hybriden main in siddhanton kaa varnan kiya, ki vah 8 farvari or 8 par Brno ke natural history sosayadi ko padhane ke liye march 1865, or jo 1866 main prakashit kiya gaya tha
 Mendel's conclusions were largely ignored
 haalanki ve puri tarah se samay kii jeev ke liye anjaan nahin the, ve aam taur par lagu ke rup main nahin dekha gaya tha yahaan tak ki khud mendel, jo sochaa tha ki ve sirf ek hi prajati yaa lakshan ke kuch shreniyon ke liye aavedan kiya he
 a major block to understanding their importance is the apparent blending of inheritance traits in the overall form of progeny linked to the 19th-century organism, now, the organ known to cause multigeneous relationships was unlike the typical binary study characters Mendel by
 1900 main, haalanki, apane kaam "ko phir se khoj" tha teen europea vaigyanikon, hugo de Vries, karl Correns, or erik won Tschermak dwaara
 The true nature of "rediscover" has been debated somewhat: De Vries first published on the subject, mentioning Mendel in a footnote, while reading Correns De Vries' paper and realizing that he himself was not Mendel Outlined priority of priority
 De Vries sachai ko sweekaar nahin ho saktaa he ki kaise kanoon ke apane gyaan kaa zyada apane kaam se aayaa he, yaa keval mendel ke akhbaar padhane ke baad aayaa he
 Later scholars have accused von Tschermak of not really understanding the outcome at all
 bhale hi, "phir se khoj" Mendelism ek mahatvapurn he, lekin vivaadaaspad siddhant banaaya he
 Its most vigorous promoter in Europe was William Bateson, who coined the terms "genetics" and "alleles" to describe many of his theories
 anuvanshikta ke model atyadhik anya jeev dwaara ladaa gaya tha kyonki yah nihit he ki anuvanshikta jahiraa taur par nirantar parivartan kai lakshan ke liye namoodaar ko asantat tha, vipaksh main
 Many organisms also rejected the theory because they were not sure that it would apply to all species
 haalanki, jeev or is tarah ke ronaald fisher ke rup main sankhyikeevidon ne baad main kaam se pataa chalaa he ki agar kai karkon mendelian ek vyakti visheshta kii abhivyakti main shaamil the, ve manaaya vividh parinaam kaa utpaadan kar saktaa he, or is tarah se pataa chalaa he ki mendelian anuvanshiki prakritik chayan ke saath sangat he
 Thomas Hunt Morgan and his assistants later integrated Mendel's theoretical model with the chromosomal theory of succession, which were clustering the actual hereditary material of chromosomes of cells, and created what was now known as classical genetics, which was highly successful And confirmed Mendel's place in history
 mendel ke nishkarsh is tarah kii anumati fisher or J
B
S
 ke rup main vaigyanikon halden ganitiya sambhaavnaaon ke aadhaar par lakshan kii abhivyakti kaa anumaan he
 a major contribution to Mendel's success can be traced to his decision to start with only the plants he exhibited were true breeding
 unhone yah bhi keval is tarah ke rang, aakaar, or vansh kii sthiti, balki maatraatmak visheshtaon kii tulana ke rup main purna visheshtaon, mapa
 He expressed his results numerically and subjected them to statistical analysis
 data vishleshan kaa unka tarika he or apane bade aakaar ke namoonay apane data ko vishwasaneeyata de di he
 He also had foresight to follow several generations of pea plants and record their changes
 ant main, vah pradarshan kiya "pareekshan paar" upasthiti or peeche hatane kaa paatro ke anupaat main prakat karte hai
 First law: the law of secession
 duusare kanoon: swatantra vargeekaran kii kanoon
 Third law: law of dominance algaav kii kanoon kahata he ki har vyakti ke jeev prayek visheshta ke liye do alleles hota he, or he ki in alleles ardhasutrivibhaajan dauraan alag prayek yugmak keval alleles main se ek hota he ki is tarah kii he
 a lineage thus receives a pair of alleles for one characterized by inheriting homologous chromosomes from the parent organisms:
 prayek mata pita se prayek visheshta ke liye ek elil
 Molecular evidence of this theory was later interpreted by two scientists independently, the German botanist Oscar Hertwig in 1876, and the Belgian zoologist 1883 in the paternal and maternal chromosomes Eduard van Beneden in meiosis and the observation of meiosis by alleles
 a character found through the medium are separated into two separate couplers
 har mata pita ke liye ek ekal yugmak yogadan detaa he, or is tarah ek ekal, betaratib dhang se safal elil unke vansh or nishechan ko copy
 The law of independent classification states that alleles for different traits are passed independently of each other from the parents of the offspring
 yahi he, ek visheshta ke liye ek elil kii jaivik chayan kisi anya ke liye ek elil ke chayan ke saath kuch nahin karnaa he visheshta
 Mendel found support for this law in his dihybrid cross experiments
 monohybrid paar, adarsh 3: pramukh or peeche hatane kaa phenotypes ke bich 1 ke anupaat main hui
 In dihybrid crosses in the ratio of 3: 3: 1, however, he found a 9
 isse pataa chalata he ki do alleles se prayek ek 3 ke saath duusare se swatantra rup se viraasat main mili he,: prayek ke liye 1 prarupi anupaat
 Independent classification occurs in eukaryotic organisms during meiotic prophase I, and produces a gametes with a mixture of the organism's chromosomes
 gunasutron ke swatantra vargeekaran ke bhautik aadhaar anya dwisanyojak gunasutron ke sambandh main metaphase thali ke saath prayek bivalent gunasutra ke yadrichhik unmukhikaran he
 Genetic diversity increases by creating novel genetic combinations that cross-independent classification
 prabhutv ke mendel kaa kanoon kahata he ki peeche hatane kaa alleles hameshaa pramukh alleles nakaabposh dwaara kii jaaegi
 Therefore, a cross between a homozygous dominant and a homozygous ineffective will always express the dominant phenotype, while still performing a heterozygous genotype
 prabhutv kaa kanoon ek mono sankar paar prayog kii madad se aasaani se samajhaayaa ja saktaa he: - kisi bhi jodi ke liye shuddh do jeevon lakshan visham ke bich ek cross main, charitra ki F1 peedi main prakat hota he kaha jaataa he " pramukh "or ek he jo dabaa diya jaataa he kaha jaataa he" peeche hatane kaa
 "each character is controlled by a pair of different factors
 keval paatro main se ek ko vyakt karata he
 The one expressed in the F1 generation is called the head
 lekin use yah bhi dhyaan den, ki prabhutv ke kanoon mahatvapurn or sahi he, lekin saarvbhaumik rup se lagu nahin he mahatvapurn he
 According to the latest amendment, only two laws of these rules are considered
 tisare ek ek buniyadi siddhant nahin balki mendel kaa ek anuvanshik kanoon ke rup main mana jaataa he
 a Mendelian trait is controlled by a single locus in a one-part pattern
 aise maamalon main, ek bhi jin main utparivartan ek rog he ki mendel ke kanoonon ke anusaar viraasat main mili he paidaa kar saktaa he
 Examples include sickle cell anemia, Tay Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, and Xeroderma pigmentosa
 ek rog ek jin dwaara niyantrit ek bahu bhajya rog, gathiya kii tarah he, jo kai loki se prabhavit hota he or saath hi saath un bimariyon ek gaiyr mendelian fishan main viraasat main mila ke saath virodhabhaason

 These networks usually connect different nodes through an ad hoc connection on a large scale
 is tarah ke network kai prayojanon ke liye upyogi hote hai
 Through this network, sharing of files related to audio, video and data or more which are available in digital format is very common
 iske atirikt pi2pi praudyogiki ko vaastavik samayaadhar aankade jaise telephone yatayaat ke liye bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Not based on the concept of a purely P2P network client-server model, in which communication is usually to or from the central server, on the contrary it is based on the assumption of similar peer nodes under which one peer node is simultaneously on the other on this network Serves as both "client" and "server" for nodes

 Unlike a pure P2P network, Usenet News Server is an example of a distributed discussion system that works on a client-server model
 iske antargat samachar sarwar yuzanet network par ek duusare se sampark karte hai or samachar lekhon kaa saseekaran karte hai
 Especially in the early days of Usenet, UUCP expanded beyond the Internet
 haalanki samachar sarwar pranali ek claayent-sarwar ke rup main kaary karti he jab upyogkarta lekhon ko padhane or apane lekhon ko bhejne ke liye ek sthaneey samachar sarwar se sampark karata he
 The same logic applies to SMTP e-mail, where the mail transfer agent's core e-mail relaying network mimics P2P, while the e-mail clients' perimeter and their direct connections are of the client-server type
 kuch network or channel jaise napster, open enepi or iarasi seva channel kuch kaaryon ke liye claayent-sarwar or dusron ke liye ek pi2pi sanrachanaon kaa upyog karte hai
 Networks such as Nutella or freenet, for all purposes, use a P2P structure and are sometimes referred to as pure P2P networks, although Nutella is heavily assisted by directory servers that allow one peer to network with another peer

 More recently, this concept has been recognized in the general public
 tarkshastra main kathan aisa vaakya hota he jisamen koi daawa kara ja rahaa ho jo yaa to yaa to satya he yaa asaty
 It is not necessary to know whether the statement is true or false
 nimnlikhit vaakya kathan hai, kyonki in sab main aise daawey nihit hai jo yaa to satya hai yaa asaty: The following sentences are not logically statements: in gair-kathaneey udaahranon main teesraa vaakya kathan nahin he kyonki haryana kaa koi raja nahin he - yani is vaakya kaa daawa nirarthak he or iske satya / asaty hone kaa prashn hi nahin uthta
 The fourth sentence is also not a statement because it is true or false for different person
