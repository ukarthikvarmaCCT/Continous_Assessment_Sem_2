 These meanings are designated by the noun of Kavisamaya
 vaaman ne sabase pehle 'kavyasmay' shabd kaa prayog vyakaran, chand evam ling ke sambandh main pratishthit kaviparipati kaa bodh karaane ke liye kiya
 But this word could not be more prevalent
 rajasekhar ne kavismay kii paribhaasha is prakaar prastut kii hai- He has also written in this subject later: rajasekhar ke parvarti sanskrit ke aacharyon hemchandra, amarchandra, keshavamishra, tathaa hindi ke aacharyon keshavadas or jagannathprasad "bhanu' ityadi ne kavismay par jo vivechan kiye hai, ve praaia: sabhi rajasekhar ke aadhaar par hai
 According to Dr
 Hazariprasad Dwivedi "the word Kavisamaya means the ethos or sect of poets
 pramadaon kii vibhinn kriyaaon se ashok, mandaar, bakul, aam, kurbak aadi kaa phoolnaa ; nadiyon main camel kaa khilanaa ; chukor kaa aag khaanaa; chatak kaa maatr swatijal pinaa aadi kuch pramukh "kavismay' hai
 They are also known as "kaviprasiddhi" and are mostly based on the concept of a concept and to a certain extent reality
 yahan is tathy kaa bhi ullekh kar dena aavashyak he ki kala main kisi kaalpanik yaa vaastavik vastu ko alankruti maatr ke liye abhipraay ke rup main prayukt kiya jaataa he jab ki kavy main abhipraay yaa kavismay mukhyaswaroop se us paramparaagat vichaar ko kehete hai jo alokik or ashastreey hote hue bhi upyogita or anukaran ke kaaran kaviyon dwaara gruhit hota he tathaa baad main chalakar rudh ho jaataa he
 Rajasekhar has placed "kavisamayas" in three major categories: swarglok sambandhi; yatha, chandramaa main dikhaai denevaale kaale dhabbe ko kalank, khargosh yaa hiran maananaa; kaamdev kii pataakaa main min yaa makar ke aakaar kaa varnan karnaa; kaamdev ko moort yaa amoort donon roopon main prastut karnaa; chadramaa kaa janm samudrmanthan se yaa atri rishi ke netra se maananaa; shiv ke mastak par balachandra ko maananaa aadi
 Hades; As such, consider the serpent and the snake as one and similarly consider the monster, demon and demon as one
 prithvilok sambandhi
 The categories of this category are divided into four categories: jaturup, dravyarup, kriyaaroop tathaa gunrup
 Each of these also has three distinctions: discrete, to describe what is not present, even when it is present, which should not be described, and rules, to describe an object in the context of a particular place and even when it is found elsewhere
 Do not describe in the context of that place

 The following were the reasons for the American Civil War- sanyukt rajya america ke uttari rajyon kii sthiti jananaankeey evam aarthik drushti se apekshaakrit majboot thi
 Out of the 34 states of the Union, 23 states were included in the north and 2 / 3 of the total population of the country lived in the north, with a very small number of slaves
 uttari rajyon main udyogon kii pradhanta thi
 In industries, cotton, woolen garments, leather goods etc
 were produced on a large scale
 in kaarkaanon main mazdooron dwaara mashiinon se utpaadan hota tha, atah yahaan gulaamon evam daason kaa vishesh mahatv nahin tha
 On the other hand, the economic life of the southern states of America was based on agriculture and there was not much use of machines in agriculture
 atah in rajyon ke kisaan kheti ke liye gulaamon ke shram par nirbhar the
 In the south, cotton, sugarcane and tobacco were cultivated on a large scale in which slaves worked as laborers
 atah dakshin kaa samaaj purna rup se daason par nirbhar tha
 In this way, the southern state was distinguished from the northern and western parts due to its characteristics, the prevalent slave system and plantation system prevalent there
 dakshini rajya-varjeenia se lekar dakshini carolina hote hue georgia tak ek pattee ke rup main faile the

 atah unhen yah mahasoos hua ki sangh kaa prayog uttari america ke hiton ke liye kiya ja rahaa he or dakshini rajyon ke prati upeksha kii drushti rakhi ja rahi he
 In the northern states of America, slaves had no decisive role in economic life
 atah unke liye daason kaa mahatv gaun tha duusari taraf america ke dakshini rajyon main das pratha janajivan main ghul chuki thi
 In the southern states, the issue of slavery was always sensitive
 jab kabhi anya rajyon me das pratha par lage pratibandh ko in dakshini, rajyon main lagu karne kii uthi to in rajyon ne ise apni prabhusatta par akraman mana
 In fact, slavery was seen as a stigma on humanity in the northern states and the demand to abolish it was raised
this anti-slave sentiment was raised samachar-patron main madhyam se is das virdohi bhaavana ko ubhaara gaya
 On the other hand the issue of slaves for the southern states was linked to profitability
 unka tark tha ki das pratha main shramik sanghathanon, hadataalon aadi kaa bhay nahin tha tathaa uttari rajyon ke mazdooron kii tulana main ve daason ko adhik suvidha pradaan karte hai

 This boundary line was called the "mesum-dixon" boundary
 ab america kaa pashchimi kshetron main vistaar ho rahaa tha or nae-nae kshetra sanyukt rajya america main shaamil kiye ja rahe the
 In such a situation a question arose whether these states should be included as a slave state or as an independent state
 yah mudda isliye bhi mahatvapurn tha kyonki samvidhan main yah sweekaar kiya gaya tha ki sangheey vyavasthapika main daason kii gananaa bhi hoti thi kintu daason kii jansankhya ko 3 / 5 ke ausat main pratinidhitiv diya jaataa tha arthath daason kii jansankhya yadi 500 hogi to use 300 maanakar pratinidhitiv diya jane laga
 Thus, with the increase in the number of slave states, there was a danger of increasing the dominance of slave states in the administration

 The dispute deepened over the merger of the state of Missouri

 Texas eventually joined the Union in 1845 as a slave state
 phir california ke mudde par vivaad hua or antat california ko 1850 main swatantra rajya ke rup main sammilit kiya gaya
 It was fiercely opposed in the southern states
 ab unhen santusht karne ke liye ek “bhagoda das” kanoon laayaa gaya jiske tahat bhaage hue das ko punah pakadaa ja saktaa tha
 This law was opposed by the northern states as they gave shelter to fugitive slaves
 kintu 1854 main cansus evam nebraska ke vilay ke prashn ne vivaad ko or gaharaa diya
 In fact, these two states were located 30 degrees 30 minutes north and according to the Missouri Accord they were to be included as independent states, but with the effort of a politician named Stephen Douglas, these states were incorporated as slave states
