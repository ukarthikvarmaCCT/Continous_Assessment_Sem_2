 Since ancient times, followers of different religions and beliefs have lived in India
 in sabamein mail-jol or bhaichara badhaane ke liye santon ne samay-samay par mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 The name of Shiromani Raidas is foregone in such saints
 ve sant kabir ke gurubhai the kyonki unke bhi guru swami ramanand the
 In his memory, Magh Purna is celebrated as Ravidas Jayanti
 guru ravidaas ji kaa janm kaashi main hua tha
 His father's name is said to be Santokh Das and mother's name is Kalsa Devi
 raidas ne sadhu-santon kii sangati se paryaapt vyaavhaarik gyaan praapt kiya tha
 His ancestral business was shoe-making, and he happily embraced it
 ve apana kaam puri lagan tathaa parishram se karte the or samay se kaam ko puraa karne par bahut dhyaan dete the
 People who came in contact with him due to his timeliness and sweet behavior were also very happy
 prarambh se hi ravidaas ji bahut paropkaaree tathaa dayaalu the or dusron kii sahaayta karnaa unka swabhaav ban gaya tha
 He used to get special pleasure in helping saints and saints
 ve unhen praaia: mulya liye bina juute bhent kar diya karte the
 His parents were unhappy with him because of his nature
 kuch samay baad unhone ravidaas tathaa unki patni ko apane ghar se bhaga diya
 Ravidas ji used to work his business in the neighborhood by making a separate building for himself and used to spend the rest of the time in ishvara-bhajan and satsang of saints and saints
 unke jivan kii choti-choti ghatnaon se samay tathaa vachan ke paalan sambandhi unke gunon kaa pataa chalata he
 Once, on the occasion of a festival, the people of the neighborhood were going for a Ganga-bath
 raidas ke shishyon main se ek ne unase bhi chalane kaa aagrah kiya to ve bole, ganga-snaan ke liye main avashya chalata kintu ek vyakti ko juute banaakar aaj hi dene kaa maine vachan de rakhaa he
 If i could not give him the shoes today, the promise would break
 ganga snaan ke liye jane par man yahan laga rahegaa to punya kaise praapt hoga ? man jo kaam karne ke liye ant:karan se taiyaar ho vahi kaam karnaa uchit he
 If the mind is right, then it can attain the virtue of Gangesanan only in the waters of Kahouta
 kaha jaataa he ki is prakaar ke vyavhaar ke baad se hi kahawat prachlit ho gayi ki - man changa to kathoti main ganga
 Raidas termed the controversy in the name of high and low spirit and devotion to God as meaningless and meaningless and exhorted everyone to live together in a loving manner
 ve swayan madhur tathaa bhakthipurna bhajanon kii rachana karte the or unhen bhav-vibhor hokar sunaate the

 apane ek bhajan main unhone kaha he- Say, Raidas is your distance, part is so beautiful
 taji abhimaan meti aapa par, pipilak havai chuni khaavai
 Their thoughts mean that devotion to God comes from great fortune
 abhimaan shunya rahakar kaam karne vaala vyakti jivan main safal rahata he jaise ki vishalkay hathi shakkar ke kanon ko chunane main asamarth rahata he jabaki laghu sharir kii pipilika in kanon ko saraltapurvak chun leti he
 Similarly, a man who behaves politely after abandoning the feeling of pride and nobility can be a devotee of God
 raidas kii vaani bhakthi kii sachhee bhaavana, samaaj ke vyapak hit kii kaamana tathaa maanav prem se ot-prot hoti thi
 Therefore, it had a profound effect on the minds of the listeners
 unke bhajanon tathaa upadeshon se logon ko aisi shiksha milti thi jisase unki shankaaon kaa santoshajanak samaadhaan ho jaataa tha or log swat: unke anuyaayi ban jate the
 His speech had such a wide impact that people from all sections of society became devoted to him
 kaha jaataa he ki mirabai unki bhakthi-bhaavana se bahut prabhavit huin or unki shishyaa ban gayi thim
 Varnashram Abhiman Taji, the post of Raja Bandhijasu
 sandeh-granthi khandan-nipan, bani vimul raidas kii
 
 aaj bhi sant raidas ke upadesh samaaj ke kalyaan tathaa utthan ke liye atyadhik mahatvapurn hai
 He has proved by his conduct and behavior that a man is not great by virtue of his birth and occupation
 vichaaron kii shreshthata, samaaj ke hit kii bhaavana se prerit kaary tathaa sadvyavahaar jaise gun hi manushya ko mahaan banane main sahaayak hote hai
 Due to these qualities, Saint Raidas received immense respect in the society of his time and for this reason people still remember him devoutly
 raidas manush naa jud sake jab tak jati na jaat

 Flag ghanatv The Mughal Empire was an Islamic turkish-mongol Empire that began in 1526, ruled the Indian subcontinent until the late 17th and early 18th centuries and ended in the mid-19th century
 mogul samraat turk-mongol peedi ke taimurvanshi the or inhone ati parishkrut mishrit hind-farsi samskruti ko viksit kiya
 Around 1700, at the height of its power, it controlled much of the Indian subcontinent - extending from present-day Bangladesh in the east to Baluchistan in the west and from Kashmir in the north to the Cauvery Valley in the south

 During this time, a highly centralized administration was created connecting various regions

 The foundation of the Umairids Empire was established by Prince Babur of the Timurid dynasty around the early 1500s, when he captured Doab and controlled the fertile region of Sindh and the lower valley of the Indus River by the eastern region of Khorasan
 1526 main, babar ne dilli ke sultaanon main aakhri sultan, ibrahim shah lodi, ko panipat ke pehle yuddh main haraaya
 To secure the establishment of his new kingdom, Babur faced a Rajput treaty in the Battle of Khanwa led by Rana Sanga of Chittor

 Babur's son Humayun succeeded him in 1530, but Pashtun suffered major reverses at the hands of Sher Shah Suri and effectively defeated most of the new empire before moving from territorial state
 1540 se humayun ek nirvasit shaasha bane, 1554 main safawid darbar main pahunche jabaki abhi bhi kuch kile or chote kshetra unki sena dwaara niyantrit the
 But when Pashtun fell into disarray after Sher Shah Suri's death, Humayun returned with a mixed army, mobilized more troops and managed to reconquer Delhi in 1555
 humayun ne apni patni ke saath makaran ke khurdure ilaakon ko paar kiya, lekin yatra kii nishthurataa se bachaane ke liye apane shishu bete jilaluddin ko peeche chhod gaye

 On 14 February 1556, during a war against Sikandar Shah Suri for the throne of Delhi, Akbar succeeded his father

 He became known as Akbar

 This dynasty is sometimes known as Timurid dynasty because Babur was a descendant of Timur
 faraghna vaadi se aae ek turki muslim timurid sipahasaalar babar ne mogul rajvansh ko sthapit kiya
 He attacked parts of northern India and defeated the ruler of Delhi, Ibrahim Shah Lodhi in 1526 in the first battle of Panipat
 mogul samrajya ne uttari bharat ke shaskaon ke rup main dilli ke sultan kaa sthaan liya
 Over time, the kingdom established by Umer crossed the boundary of the Sultan of Delhi, eventually besieging a large part of India and earning the title of empire

 The first six emperors, who enjoyed both "lawful" and "rail" powers, usually refer to him by just one name, a title that was adopted by each of the nobles upon his accession

 Akbar introduced certain important policies, such as religious liberalism, the inclusion of Hindus in the affairs of the empire and political alliances / marriage with the Hindu Rajput caste, which were innovative to their environment
 unhone sher shah suri kii kuch nitiyon ko bhi apanaaya tha, jaise kii apane prashasan main samrajya ko sarkaron main vibhajit karnaa
 These policies undoubtedly helped maintain power and the stability of the empire, were protected by two immediate successors, but were abandoned by Aurangzeb, who adopted a policy that had little place for religious tolerance

 This enterprise drained the resources of the empire which aroused strong resistance within the Marathas, Sikhs of Punjab and Hindu Rajputs

 Beginning with Bahadur Zafar Shah I, the Mughal emperors declined in power and became fictitious chieftains, initially controlled by various diverse courtesans and later by several rising chieftains

 phir bhi, kuch dashakon ke baad, BEIC ne samraat ke nammaatr naukaron ke rup main or unke naam par, apane niyantran ke adheen kshetron main shashan jari rakhaa, 1827 main yah shishtachar bhi khatm ho gaya tha
 When some rebels of the Sepoy Mutiny announced their allegiance to Bahadur Zafar Shah II, a descendant of Shah Alam, the British decided to abolish this institution altogether
 unhone 1857 main antim mogul samraat ko pad se giraaya or unhen burma ke liye nirvasit kiya, jahaan 1862 main unki mrityu ho gai
 Thus came the end of the Mughal dynasty, which contributed an important chapter to the history of India, Bangladesh and Pakistan

 19ve sadi ke andhkaarmay bharat main jin mahanubhaavon ne jagrati kii jyoti jagaai unamem rishi dayanand kaa san desh bahut vyapak tha
 He was an era-rishi who gave a message of new ideas in all areas of education, politics, social organization etc
 rishi dayanand ne apane samay main prachlit shiksha-paddati main anek dosha anubhav karpracheen arya shiksha-pranali kaa pratipaadan kiya
 The sage gave him the name of 'gurukul education system'
 unke samay bharat main shiksha kii mukhyatya do pranaliyaan prachlit thim - ek bharat cabritish shaskaon dwaara prarambh kii gai thi or duusari puraani parampara ke anusaar pandit-mandali main prachlit thi
 The system practiced by the government was a counter to the national and religious ideals of India
 usamen bharat kii bhashaa, dharm, sabhyataa, sahitya tathaa samskruti kii sarvatha upeksha kii gai thi
 The education system of the Pandit congregation did not meet the requirements of the time, in which the knowledge-sciences of the present era did not have any place, it nurtured the hypocrisies
 charitra nirmaan ke liye brahmacharya, tyaag, tapasya aadi jin aadarshon kaa paalan aavashyak he, unka donon pranaaliyon main mahatv na tha
 Rishi Dayanand felt that these defects should be removed by reviving the ancient Gurukul system in India
 unhone shiksha ke aadarshon or siddhanton kaa pratipaadan ‘satyarth prakaash' ke tisare samullas main kiya -nihsandeh rishi dayanand ke vichaar shiksha ke kshetra main atyant krantikari vichaar the
 Mahatma Munshi Ram, a prominent disciple of Rishi Dayanand in 1897, gave the following reasons for the need to start Gurukula - 19veen shatabdi main bharat main do prakaar kii shikshapaddatiyaan prachlit thim
 The first method was the system of government schools and universities developed by the British government to meet the requirements of its governance and the second was the school system of studying various disciplines of Sanskrit, grammar, philosophy, etc
, in the ancient traditional method
 donon paddatiyon main kuch gambhir dosha the
 In the first system, there was a great expectation of post-scriptural knowledge and it was completely national
 iske prabal samarthak tathaa 1835 i

 Hence, the emphasis was on the study of English and Western literature and science of knowledge in the government education system, neglecting Indian poetry
 is shiksha paddati kaa pradhan uddeshy mekale ke shabdon main 'bharatiyon kaa ek aisa samooh paidaa karnaa tha, jo rang tathaa rakt kii drushti se to bhartiya ho, parantu ruchi, mati or achaar-vichaar kii drushti se angrej ho'
 Therefore, this teaching was contrary to the national and religious ideals of India
 duusari shiksha pranali, panditmandli main prachlit paathshaala paddati thi
 Although Indian poetry was studied in it, there was a gross neglect of knowledge science necessary for the new and present time

 Gurukul Kangri contributed immensely in carrying out this important work

 He started a strong movement for the revival of the Gurukul education system in 1897 by his letter 'saddharm Pracharak'
 30 oktober 1898 ko unhone isaki vistrut yojana rakhi
 In November 1898, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha, the central organization of the Arya Samaj of Punjab, accepted the proposal to open a gurukula and Mahatma Munshiram pledged that he would stay in his house until he collected Rs 30,000 for this task

 Gurukul was established on 16 May 1900 at Gujranwala in Punjab with a Vedic school

 He gave a mantra of Shukla Yajurveda 'upahvare Girinanam Sangme Ch Nadiyan'

 At this time Munshi Amansingh ji, a pious nobleman of Najibabad, donated 1,200 bighas of Kangri village to Mahatma Munshiram ji for this work
 himalay kii upatyaka main ganga ke tat par saghan ramnik wanon se ghiri kangri kii bhoomi gurukul ke liye adarsh thi
 Hence, some forests were made here after clearing the dense forest and on Monday, 4 March 1902, on the day of Holi, Gurukul Gujranwala was brought to Kangri

 On 1 May 1930 AD, Gurukul was moved from the eastern coast of the Ganges to the present location near Haridwar on the Ganges canal on the west coast for protection from future floods
 1935 i
 main iskaa prabandh karne ke liye arya pratinidhi sabha, punjab ke antargat ek pruthak vidyasabha kaa sanghathan hua
 The salient features of the Gurukul education system are - students are in touch with the Gurus, to be part of their clan or family, to live a simple and ascetic life in a holistic manner, to pay full attention to character building and physical development like intellectual and mental development, to Sanskrit in education
 Making compulsory, emphasizing the study of Vedic poetry, making Hindi the medium of education, Sanskrit, Dar No, Veda, etc

 At that time, modern scholarly books were not in Hindi

 baat us samay kii he jab manu or satarupa parambrahm kii tapasya kar rahe the
 After doing penance for many years, Shankarji himself said to Parvati that I, Brahma and Vishnu came to Manu Satarupa many times to give brides, which is mentioned in the Ramcharitmanas composed by Tulsi Das ji like this- "bidhi hari har aapa dekhri Apara, Manu came close to Bahu Bara "
 jaisaa kii uparokt chaupai se pataa chalata he ki ye log to kai baar aaye yah kehane ki jo var tum maanganaa chaahate ho maang lo; par manu satarupa ko to putr rup main swayan parambrahm ko hi maanganaa tha phir ye kaise unase yani shankar, brahma or vishnu se var maangate? hamaare prabhu shriram to sarvajna hai
 They automatically know the desire of the devotee's heart

 bharat kii panchayat raaj pranali main gaanv yaa chote kasbe ke str par gram panchayat yaa gram sabha hoti he jo bharat ke sthaneey swashaasan kaa pramukh avyav he
 The sarpanch is the elected supreme representative of the gram sabha
 pracheen kaal se hi bharatvarsh ke saamaajik, raajnneetik or aarthik jivan main panchayat kaa mahatvapurn sthaan rahaa he
 Every aspect of public life was governed by this
 vaidic kaal main bhi panchayaton kaa astitv tha
 The head of the village was called Gramani
 uttar vaidic kaal main bhi yah hota tha jiske madhyam se raja gram par shashan karata tha
 The "village elders" were included in the Buddhist village councils
 inke pramukh ko "grambhojak" kehete the
 The council or panchayat used to arrange the land of the village and help the village collector in maintaining peace and security in the village
 janhit ke anya kaaryon kaa sampadan bhi vahi karti thi
 Panchayat is also mentioned in Smriti texts
 kautilya ne gram ko raajnneetik ikai mana he
 The "grammarian" of "economics" was the head of the village, which had so many rights
 apane saarvajanik kartavyon ko puraa karne main vah gramvaasiyon kii sahaayta letaa tha
 Cooperation of villagers in other public interest works was also desirable
 gram kii ek saarvajanik nidhi bhi hoti thi jisamen jurmaane, dand aadi se dhan aata tha
 Thus the rights and duties of the Gramikas and Grampanchayats were included, whose violation was punishable

 He ruled the village with the help of "panchamandal" or Panchayat
 "gramvriddh" is panchayat ke sadsy hote the
 Harsha also adopted this system

 The Madhuban inscription of Harsha mentions Samakundaka village which was under the theme "kundaghani" and "ahichhatra" Bhukti

 The Chola and North Mallur inscriptions of the ninth and tenth centuries show that there was a panchayat system in the south as well
 graamy swashaasan kaa vikaas chol shashan kii mukhya visheshta thi
 These communal governance units were called "kurrum", which included several villages
 kurrum ek swaitshasi ikai thi
 Governance was vested in a Mahasabha, the people of the district village were elected and the assembly used to run the work of governance through its committees
 is prakaar kii aath samitiyaan thim jo janhit ke vibhinn kaaryon ko karne ke atirikt shanti or suraksha banaae rakhane ke liye uttaradaayi thim
 She also used to do justice related work
 gram puri tarah swaitshasi tha or is prakaar kendriya shashan anek dayitvon se mukt rahata tha
 Some kind of panchayat system continued in Muslim and Maratha periods too, and each village remained self-supporting
 angreji shasankaal main panchayat-vyavastha ko sabase adhik dhakka pahunchaa or vah yah vyavastha chhin-bhinn ho gai
 Nevertheless, Panchayats remained in the social life of the villages
 prayek jati athwa varg kii apni alag-alag panchayatein thim jo uske saamaajik jivan ko niyantrit karti thim or panchayat kii vyavastha evam niyamon kaa ulanghan karanevaale ko kathor dand diya jaataa tha
 The government did not interfere in the actions of these panchayats
 aarambh se hi angrejon kii niti yah rahi ki shashan kaa kaam, yathasambhav, adhikadhik rajya karmchaariyon ke haathon main hi rahe
 As a result, due to the establishment of foreclosure and civil courts, new revenue policy, policing, development of means of swapping, etc
, the self-reliant life and local autonomy of the villages gradually ended
 parantu aage chalakar angrejon ne bhi yah anubhav kiya ki unki kendrikaran kii niti se shashanbhaar din prati din badhata hi ja rahaa he
 On the other hand, the demand for autonomous governance was also increasing due to national awakening
 atev unhen vikendrikaran kii disha main kadam uthaane ko baadhya hona padaa
 Initially district boards and municipal boards were established
 san 1907 ke vikendrikaran sambandhi shahi kamishan ne panchayaton ke mahatv ko swikar kiya or apni report main likhaa ki kisi bhi sthaayee sanghathan kii neenv, jisase janata kaa sakriy sahyog prashasan ke saath ho, graamon main hi honi chahie
 The commission recommended that in a few selected villages, which are free from mutual penalties and quarrels, panchayats should be established and initially given limited powers
 tatkaaleen bharat sarkaar ne 1915 i
 main kamishan kii siforeeshon ko siddhantat: to swikar kar liya parantu vyavhaar main unki purnataya upeksha kii gai
 Panchayats were formed in very few villages; Those who remained were also fully controlled by the government
 bharat sarkaar ke 1919 main adhinium ke anusaar prantiy sarkaron ko swashaasan ke kuch adhikaar die gaye or 1920 ke aasapaas sabhi praanton main gram panchayat adhinium banaae gaye
 About 4700 gram panchayats were established in the United States under the Panchayat Act of 1920
 sabhi praanton main panchayaton ko simit adhikaar die gaye
 She took care of public health, sanitation, medicine, development, roads, ponds, wells etc
 unhen nyaay sambandhi kuch adhikaar bhi praapt the
 They are maximum Rs 200
 Could take cases related to movable property and Rs
 50 in criminal cases
 Could be fined till
 inaki aay kaa mukhya saadhan jurmaana yaa daan tha
 But the reality was that these panchayats were totally ineffective compared to the ancient panchayats, their panches were nominated by the government without being elected by the people and their economic condition was bad due to lack of income
 duusari ore rashtriya andolan ke karnadhaar yah anubhav karte the ki gaanvon kaa aarthik or naitik patan keval panchayaton kii pun: sthapana dwaara hi roka ja saktaa he
 In the Dasutri program for Gandhi's villages, the main thing was to strengthen the panchayats
 ve panchayaton ko swantatra bharat kii shashanvyavastha kii aadharshila bananaa chaahate the
 This was the norm in 1937 in front of the Congress governments established in seven provinces
 uttar pradesh main anek graamon main jeevansudhar samitiyaan banaai gai jinhen gramvikas ke kaary saunpe gaye
 Thus until 1947 AD, there was lack of proper panchayat system in the villages
