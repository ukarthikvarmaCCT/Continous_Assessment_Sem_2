 khaaton ko debit yaa credit karnaa - jab kisi len-dein main koi khaataa ‘len’ paksh hota he arthath usko laabh praapt hota he tab us khato ko debit kiya jaataa he

 isi prakaar jab koi khaataa lenden main dein paksh hota he arthath uske dwaara kuch laabh kisi ko hota he, tab us khate ko credit kiya jaataa he
 That is, the transaction will be accounted for in the credit portion of that account
 prayek lenden main is tarah ek khaataa tathaa doosraa khaataa credit kiya jaataa he
 The debit account has accounts on the debit side and the credit account on the credit side
 credit tathaa debit lekha dohare lekhe kii pranali ke anusaar prayek lenden ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Example: If we have bought goods worth Rs

 For this reason, this system has been called the system of double accounts
 prayek lenden main do lekhe ek debit or ek credit hota he

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga upanishad hindu dharm ke mahatvapurn shruti dharmagranth hai
 These are integral parts of Vedic hymns
 inamen parameshwar, paramatma-brahm or aatma ke swabhaav or sambandh kaa bahut hi darshanik or gyanpurvak varnan diya gaya he
 In the Upanishads, knowledge was given importance by calling rituals 'inferior' because knowledge leads from gross to subtle
 brahm, jeev or jagat kaa gyaan paanaa upanishdon kii mul shiksha he
 Together with the Bhagavad Gita and the Brahmasutra Upanishads, they are called the 'departures' of Vedanta
 upanishad hi samast bhartiya darshanon ke mul strot hai, chaahe wo veydant ho yaa sankhya yaa jain dharm yaa buddha dharm
 The Upanishads themselves have also been called Vedanta
 duniya ke kai darshanik upanishdon ko sabase behtareen gyaanakosh maanate hai
 The Upanishads are an invaluable asset to the world of Indian civilization
 mukhya upanishad 12 yaa 13 hai
 Each is associated with some Veda
 ye sanskrit main likhe gayi hai
 In the 17th century, Dara Shikoh translated many Upanishads into Persian
 19veen sadi main german tatvaveta shopenhavar or maxmooler ne in granthon main jo ruchi dikhalaakar inke anuwaad kiye vah sarvavidit hai or mananeey hai
 The word Upanishad simply means 'close upavasana' or 'sitting close by'
 yah shabd ‘up’, ‘ni’ upsarg tathaa, ‘sad’ dhaatu se nishpann hua he
 Sad Dhatu has three meanings: the destruction of details; Movement or knowing and sediment-relaxation
 upanishad main rishi or shishy ke bich bahut sundar or good samvaad he jo pathak ko veda ke marm tak pahunchaata he
 The Upanishads are the foundation of Indian spiritual thought, the source of Indian spiritual philosophy
 ve brahmavidya hai
 There are answers discovered by the sages of curiosities
 ve chintansheel rishiyon kii gyancharchaaon kaa saar hai
 They are poetic metaphysical creations of poet-hearted sages, attempts to discover the unknown, attempts to tie the indescribable superpower into words, and are written accounts of that formless, formless, boundless, inexhaustible desire to understand and define the inscrutable 
 vaidic yug sansaarik anand evam upbhog kaa yug tha
 It was an era of the piety, purity, sentimentality, naivete and sinlessness of the human mind
 jivan ko sampurna allhadpan se jeena hi us kaal ke logon kaa prey va shrey tha
 Seeing the various beautiful forms of nature, the emotions that emerged in the passionate minds of the people of that time in the form of spontaneous illumination waves, he termed them as prashas, praises, divine songs and poetic works and became Vedic rites or mantras
 un logon ke man sansaarik anand se bhare the, sampannataa se santusht the, prakritik divyataaon se bhav-vibhor ho uthte the
 Therefore, the desire in his songs is that this joy should always remain, grow and never end
 unhone kaamana kii ki is anand ko ham purna aayu sau varshon tak bhogen or hamaare baad kii peedhiyaan bhi isi prakaar trupt rahen
 Not only this, it was also wished that at the end of this life we should go to heaven and the continuation of this happiness and bliss should remain there too
 is uddeshy kii prapti ke liye vibhinn anushthan bhi kiye gaye or devataaon ko prasann karne ke aayojan karke unase ye vardaan bhi maange gaye
 When nature took a turn, natural calamities were encountered
 tab un vipattiyon kekaalpanik niyantrak devataaon yatha marut, agni, rudra aadi ko tusht va prasann karne ke anushthan kiye jate the or unase prarthana kii jaati thi ki aisi vipattiyon ko aane na den or unke aane par praja kii raksha karen
 Overall, the lives of the people of the Vedic period were cheerful, eloquent, well-meaning, optimistic, and lively
 unamem vishaad, paap yaa kshtmay jivan ke vichaar kii chaaya nahin thi
 Hell and the tortures found in it were not even imagined
 karm ko yajna or yajna ko hi karm mana gaya tha or usee ke sabhi sukhon kii prapti tathaa sankaton kaa nivaaran ho jane kii avadharana thi
 This lifestyle lasted for a long time
 par aisa kab tak chalata
 One day or the other, this curiosity had to arise in the infinitely inquisitive mind of man and never satisfied with the present, who is the creator behind this huge amphitheater of nature, who is its creator / creator, its origin
 Where is it, who are we, where have we come from, where will this creation eventually go
 hamaara kya hoga? shanai:-shanai: ye prashn ankurit hue
 And then began the quest to find answers to all this and the endless search journey of the curious mind-brain
 aisa nahin he ki aatma, punarjanm or karmfalwaad ke vishay main vaidic rishiyon ne kabhi sochaa hi nahin tha
 It was not that he did not care about this life
 rishiyon ne yada-kada is vishay par vichaar kiya bhi tha
 Its seeds are found here and there in the Vedas, but this was just a thought
 koi chintaa yaa bhay nahin
 The soul is a different element than the body, and after the end of this life, it goes to the other world, this principle is definitely found in the Vedic hymns, but the Vedic sages did not appear in the search for why the soul travels in the world
 apni samast simaaon ke saath sansaarik jivan vaidic rishiyon kaa prey tha
 The fear of leaving Preya and moving towards the credit arose at the time of the Upanishads, then the life of life in front of salvation was destroyed and when people instead of enjoying life started turning away from it and taking sannyas
 haan, yah bhi hua ki vaidic rishi jahaan yah puch kar shant ho jate the ki 'yah sristi kisne banaai he?' or 'koun devtaa he jisaki ham upasna karen'? vahaan upanishdon ke rishiyon ne sristi banane vaale ke sambandh main kuch siddhanton kaa nishchay kar diya or us 'sat' kaa bhi pataa paa liya jo puja or upasna kaa vastut: adhikaar he
 Vedas and new narratives of Vedic religion are Upanishads
 'vedon main yajna-dharm kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya or logon ko yah sikh di gai ki is jivan main sukhi, sampann tathaa sarvatra safal va vijayi rahane ke liye aavashyak he ki devataaon kii tushti va prasannataa ke liye yajna kiye jaaen
 Yajna is the place of origin of the world
 sabhi karmon main shreshth karm yajna he
 Heaven is attained by the results of the yajna
 ' ye hi sutara chaaron ore gunjit the
 Secondly, when the Brahmin texts gave great importance to the yajna and the arbitrariness of the priests and the priests increased immensely, then there was a reaction against this system and the spirit of protest was initiated
 log sochane lage ki 'yagyon kaa vaastavik arth kya he?' 'unke bheetar koun sa rahasy he?' 've dharm ke kis rup ke pratik hai?' 'kya ve hamen jivan ke charam lakshya tak pahunchaa denge?' is prakaar, karmkand par bahut adhik jor tathaa karmkandon ko hi jivan kii sabhi samasyaon ke hal ke rup main pratipaadit kiye jane kii pravriti ne vichaarvaan logon ko unke bare main punarvichaar karne ko prerit kiya
 The Vedic Aryans became polytheists while imagining a controlling deity in every form of nature
 unke devataaon main ullekhneey hai- indra, varun, agni, savita, som, ashvinikumar, marut, pushan, mitra, pitar, yama aadi
 Then an intellectual anxiety began to see that one superpower or to understand its true nature, which is the creator of the entire creation and the authority over these gods
 is vyagrata ne upanishad ke chintanon kaa maarg prashast kiya
 The Upanishads are philosophical poetic compositions of contemplative and imaginative mystics
 jahaan gadhy likh gaye hai ve bhi padyamay gadhy-rachanaaon main aisi shabd-shakti, dhvanyaatmakataa, lav evam arthgarbhita he ki ve kisi daivi shakti kii rachanaaon kaa abhas dete hai
 It is not really an exaggeration that he was called 'mantra' or 'richa'
 vastav main mantra yaa richa kaa sambandh veda se he parantu upanishdon kii hamatta darshane ke liye in sangyaaon kaa upyog yahan bhi katipay vidwaanon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The Upanishads are an attempt to peek behind the visible world around them
 iske liye na koi upkaran uplabdh hai or na kisi prakaar kii prayog-anusandhan suvidhaayen sambhav he
 Spiritual pulsation or divine light based on your mindset, mental experience or insight is the basis of the description
 upanishad aadhyaatmavidya ke vividh adhyay hai jo vibhinn ant:prerit rishiyon dwaara likhe gaye hai
 These include various metaphors and symbols describing the nature of the world, its location, its relationship with various natural powers, the glimpse of a ray in the human soul or the presence of a subtle reflection, etc
 sristi ke udgam evam uski rachana ke sambandh main gahan chintan tathaa swayanfoort kalpana se upje roopankan ko vividh bimbon or pratikon ke madhyam se prastut karne kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 In the end it was said that this is what we can understand based on our best hypothesis
 iske aage is rahasy ko shaayad paramatma hi jaanata ho or 'shaayad vah bhi nahin jaanata ho
 ' sankshep main, vedon main is sansar main drishyman evam prakat prakritik shaktiyon ke swaroop ko samajhane, unhen apni kalpanaanusaar vibhinn devataaon kaa jama pahanaakar unki aradhana karne, unhen tusht karne tathaa unase sansaarik safalataa va sampannataa evam suraksha paane ke praytn kiye gaye the
 Yagyas were created to convey their reverence to them
 upanishdon main un anek prayatnon kaa vivaran he jo in prakritik shaktiyon ke peeche kii paramashkti yaa sristi kii sarvocch satta se saakshaatkaar karne kii manokamana ke saath kiye gaye
 He tried his best to reach as far as human imagination, thinking ability, insight ability could reach the philosophers, mystics or sages of that time
 yahi unka tap tha
 The Veda has four parts - Samhita, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishads
 upanishad main aatm or anatm tattvon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he jo veda ke moulik rahasyon kaa pratipaadan karata he
 Often, the Upanishads come at the end of the Veda
 isliye ye veydant ke naam se bhi prakhyat hai
 The three major texts which authenticate the fundamental principles of Vedic religion, which are known by the name of Prasthanatrayi, are the Upanishads, Brahmasutra and Srimadbhagavadgita
 upanishad brahm vidya kaa dyotak he
 It is said that the practice of this knowledge destroys the ignorance of Mummukhujan; She makes Brahma attain; Due to which, the sorrows of human beings etc
, worldly sorrows are completely relaxed
 falat: upanishad ve ‘tatva’ pratipadak granth maane jate hai jinke abhyaas se manushya ko brahm athwa paramatma kaa saakshaatkaar hota he

 shruti virshaiv dharm ke sarvocch granth hai
 Under it comes the Athavis Shaivagam: Vatulagam, Paramesvaragam Shruti is called because Veerashaiva believes that these Saivagam was narrated by the divine Shiva to Renukacharyadi Panchacharya when he was in deep meditation
 shaivagam ko shravan parampara ke anusaar guru dwaara shishyon ko diya jaataa tha
 There are four parts in every Saivagam
 inke sambandh ke bare main vivechna kii gayi he
 Shaivagam is the supreme text of the Veerashaiva religion and if there is any dispute between other Shaivite literature and poornas, then Shaivagamhi will be valid
 shaivagam ko chhodkar anya sabhi virshaiv dharmagranth prasthaan trya kahe jate hai, kyonki inamen wo kahaniyaan hai jinako logon ne peedi dar peedi yaad kiya or baad main likhaa
 All departures praise the triad Shaivagam
 inako shaivagam se nichalaa str praapt he, par ye zyaada aasaan hai or adhikansh virashaivaon dwaara padhe jate hai 
 The major departures are: - Shiddhanta Shikhani, Veerashaiva Purnan, Shivaprakasham, Lingapuran and Sivalilamart, Shiva Geeta, Vedya Vyacharya Varshbhendra Vijay and Prabhudingila, Periya Purnan etc

 Therefore, Renukacharya gave a comfortable opportunity to Veerashaivas to visit the whole of India by establishing these chairs

 shaivagam hi virshaiv dharm ke sarvocch granth hai, or agar anya shaiva sahitya or puraano main koi vivaad hota he to shaivagmahi maanya hogi
 Except Shaivagam, all other Veerashaiva scriptures are called departures, because they contain stories that people have memorized and written down from generation to generation
 sabhi prasthaan trya granth shaivagam kii prashansa karte hai 
 They have a lower standard from Saivagam, but are easier to read and are read by most Veerashaivas
 pramukh prasthaan trya hai:- aacharyo dwaara rachit shiddhant shikhani, virshaiv puuraan, shivaprakasham, lingapuran, or shivlilamrt, shiv gita, vachan sahitya varshabhendra vijay, or prabhulinglila, periy puuraan aadi
 This sabhi is in Sanskrit, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil, and Hindu
 tirth evam tirth yatra :bharat desh bada vishaal desh he, lekin uski vishalata or mahanata ko ham tab tak nahin jaan sakate, jabatak ki use dekhen nahin
 This and the way many great men were noticed, but twelve hundred years ago, Jagadguru Renukacharya did a very important work for this

 There is a lot of devotion towards our pilgrimages towards pilgrimage

 Rama is recognized as an incarnation of God in ancient India
 hindu dharm main ram vishnu ke das avtaron main se saatven avatar hai
 The life and might of Rama is described as the Sanskrit epic Ramayana composed by Maharishi Valmiki
 goswami tulsidas ne bhi unke jivan par kendrit bhakthibhaavpurn suprasiddh mahakavy shri ramcharitamanas kii rachana kii he
 Apart from these two, Ramayana has also been composed in other Indian languages, which are also very famous
 khaas taur par uttar bharat main ram atyant poojyaneey hai or adarsh purush hai
 They are also embellished with the term Purushottam
 ram, ayodhya ke raja dasharath or rani kaushalya ke sabase bade putr the
 Ram's wife was named Sita and had three brothers - Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna
 hanuman, bhagwaan ram ke, sabase bade bhakt maane jate hai
 Rama killed Ravana, the king of Lanka
 ram kii pratishtha maryaada purushottam ke rup main he
 Rama left the kingdom, friends, parents, even wife to follow decorum
 inkaa parivaar adarsh bhartiya parivaar kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Ram was born in Raghukul, whose tradition was that of Pran Jahun Baru Bachnu Na Jai
 shriram ke pita dasharath ne unki sauteli mata kaikeyi ko unki kinhin do ichchhaaon ko puraa karne kaa vachan diya tha
 Kaikeyi came under the guise of maid Manthara as these vars asked King Dasaratha for his son Bharata for the throne of Ayodhya and fourteen years of exile for Rama
 pita ke vachan kii raksha ke liye ram ne khushi se chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas sweekaar kiya
 Wife Sita thought it appropriate to go to the forest with her husband, giving the example of the ideal wife
 bhai lakshmana ne bhi ram ke saath chaudaa varsh van main bitaye
 Bharata rejects Mata's order for justice and goes to the elder brother Rama in the forest and brings him to his feet
 phir ise hi raaj gaddi par rakh kar rajkaaj kiya
 When Ram was a forest dweller, his wife Sita took Ravana away
 jangal main ram ko hanuman jaisaa mitra or bhakt mila jisane ram ke saare kaary puure karaaye
 Rama finds Sita with the help of monkeys
 samudr main pul bana kar lanka pahunche tathaa ravan ke saath yuddh kiya
 After killing him, bring Sita back
 ram ke ayodhya lautne par bharat ne rajya unako hi saunp diya
 Ram was justice-loving
 unhone bahut acha shashan kiya isliye log aaj bhi achche shashan ko raamarajy kii upama dete hai
 His two sons Kush and Love handled their kingdoms
 hindu dharm ke kai tyohaar, jaise dashahra, ram navami or deepawali, ram kii jivan-katha se jude hue hai
 The word 'ram' is derived from the addition of the suffix 'ghan' in 'rum' metal
 'ram' dhaatu kaa arth raman karne se sambaddh he
 They 'raman' in the heart of a creature, therefore 'ram' and devotees 'raman' in them, therefore they are also 'ram'
 'vishnusahasranam' par likhit apane bhashya main aadya shankaracharya ne padmapurana kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki nityanandswarup bhagavan main yogijan raman karte hai, isliye ve 'ram' hai
 Rama is not mentioned in Vedic literature in the prevailing form
 rugveda main keval do sthalon par hi 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 One of them has been used in the meaning of black in one place and the remaining one in the meaning of person; But there is also no indication of his being an avatar man or Dasaratha-son
 yadhyapi nilkanth chaturdhar ne rugveda ke anek mantron ko swavivek se chunakar unke ramakthaparak arth kiye hai, parantu yah unki nijee manyata he
 The Ramakathaparaka meaning of those mantras has not been proved by any indication or any other commentary received in those cases of Rigveda itself
 rugveda main ek sthal par 'ikshvakuh' kaa tathaa ek sthal par 'dasharath' shabd kaa bhi prayog hua he
 But there is no indication of his association with Rama
 brahman sahitya main 'ram' shabd kaa prayog aitarey brahman main do sthalon par hua he; parantu vahaan unhen 'raamo margveyah' kaha gaya he, jiskaa arth acharya sayan ke anusaar 'mrigavu' naamak stri kaa putr he
 The word 'ram' is used at a place in the Shatapatha Brahmin
 yahan 'ram' yajna ke acharya ke rup main he tathaa unhen 'ram auptpasvini' kaha gaya he
 This means that the incarnation of the prevalent Rama is due to the Valmiki Ramayana and the Puranas
 ramakatha se sambaddh sarvaadhik pramanbhoot granth adikavy valmikiy ramayana main ram-janm ke sambandh main nimnlikhit varnan uplabdh he:- xxrep 22

 arthath caitra maas kii navami tithi main, punarvasu nakshatra main, paanch grahon ke apane ucch sthaan main rahane par tathaa kark lagn main chandramaa ke saath brihaspati ke sthit hone par 
 Here only the position of Jupiter and Moon are clear
 brihaspati ucchsth he tathaa chandramaa swagruhi
 Further in the fifteenth verse, the Sun is mentioned to be high
 is prakaar brihaspati tathaa surya ke ucch hone kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Mercury is always near the Sun
 atah surya ke ucch hone par buddha kaa ucch hona asambhav he
 In this way, the remaining three planets - Mars, Venus and Saturn are left to grow higher
 isi kaaran se praayah sabhi vidwaanon ne ram-janm ke samay main surya, mangal, brihaspati, shukr tathaa shani ko ucch main sthit mana he
 Traditionally, Rama's birth is believed to be in Treta Yuga
 hindu dharamshastron main, visheshtah puranic sahitya main uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar ek chaturyugi main 43,20,000 varsh hote hai, jinamein kaliyug ke 4,32,000 varsh tathaa dwapar ke 8,64,000 varsh hote hai
 Rama was born in Treta Yug i
e
 before Dwapara
 chunki kaliyug kaa abhi prarambh hi hua he or ram kaa janm treta ke ant main hua tathaa avatar lekar dharti par unke vartmaan rahane kaa samay paramparaagat rup se 11,000 varsh mana gaya he
 Hence 8,64,000 years of Dwapara Yuga + 11,000 years of Rama's existence + 5,100 years since the end of Dwapara Yuga = 8,80,100 years in total
 atev paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm aaj se lagbhag 8,80,100 varsh pehle mana jaataa he
 Eminent Marathi researcher scholar Dr
 Padmakar Vishnu Vartak has considered this time probable from a point of view
 unka kahana he ki valmikiy ramayana main ek sthal par vindhyachal tathaa himalay kii oonchaai ko samaan bataaya gaya he
 The height of Vindhyachal is 5,000 feet and it is almost constant, while the height of the Himalayas is currently 29,029 feet and it is continuously growing
 donon kii oonchaai kaa antar 24,029 feet he
 According to experts, the Himalayas grow 3 feet in 100 years
 atah 24,029 feet badhane main himalay ko kareeb 8,01,000 varsh lage honge
 Hence, the height of the Himalayas must have been similar to that of Vindhyachal, about 8,01,000 years ago, which is mentioned in the present-day form in Valmiki Ramayana
 is tarah da0 vartak ko ek drushti se yah samay sambhav lagata he, parantu unka swayan maananaa he ki ve kisi anya strot se is samay kii pushti nahin kar sakate hai
 In his well-known treatise 'vaastav Ramayana', Dr
 Vartak has done the math on the basis of the planets, according to the planetary position mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana, to determine the actual birth date of Rama on 4 December 7323 BC
 unke anusaar isi tithi ko din main 1:30 se 3:00 baje ke bich ram kaa janm hua hoga
 After several years of research by Dr
 p
v
vartak, a research team of 'i-serve' proved Shri Ram's birth on 10 January 5114 BC using 'planetarium Gold' software
 unka maananaa tha ki is tithi ko grahon kii vahi sthiti thi jiskaa varnan valmikiy ramayana main he
 But this time has become very suspicious
 'ai-sarv' ke shodh dal ne jis 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog kiya vah vastav main isa purv 3000 se pehle kaa sahi grah-ganit karne main sakasham nahin he
 In fact, before 2013, there was no available software capable of doing so much earlier planetary mathematics
 is gananaa dwaara praapt grah-sthiti main shani vrishchik main tha arthath ucch main nahin tha
 The moon was not in Punarvasu Nakshatra but was in the second phase of Pushya and the date was also Ashtami
 baad main anya visheshgy dwaara ejplde431 software dwaara kii gayi sahi gananaa main tithi to navami ho jaati he parantu shani vrishchik main hi aata he tathaa chandramaa pushya ke chaturth charan main
 Therefore, the date of 10 January 5114 BCE is virtually not proved to be the birth date of Shri Ram
 aisi sthiti main ab yadi dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak dwaara pehle hi parishodhit tithi software dwaara pramanit ho jaae tabhi shriram kaa vaastavik samay praayah sarvamaanya ho paaegaa athwa pramanit na ho paane kii sthiti main naveen tithi ke shodh kaa rasta khulegaa
 There is clear evidence about the birth of Shri Ram in the Puranas that Shri Ram was born in a city called Ayodhya in Faizabad district of present-day Uttar Pradesh
 ayodhya jo ki bhagwaan ram ke purvajon kii hi rajdhani thi
 Raghu was the ancestor of Ramchandra ji
 ram bachapan se hi shant swabhaav ke vir purush the
 He always gave dignity the highest position
 isi kaaran unhen maryaada purushottam ram ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 His kingdom was considered fair and prosperous
 isliye bharat main jab bhi suraaj kii baat hoti he to ramraj yaa raamarajy kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 Rama, who followed the path of religion, received education from Guru Vasistha along with his three brothers
 kishoravastha main guru vishwamitra unhen van main rakshason dwaara machaae ja rahe utpaat ko samaapt karne ke liye saath le gayi
 Rama was accompanied by his younger brother Lakshmana in this task
 tadka naamak rakshasi baxur main rahati thi
 He was killed there
 ram ne us samay tadka naamak rakshasi ko maaraa tathaa marich ko palaayan ke liye majaboor kiya
 During this time, Guru Vishwamitra took him to Mithila
 vahaan ke videh raja janak ne apni putree sita ke vivaah ke liye ek swayamvar samaaroh yojit kiya tha
 Where Lord Shiva had a bow whose Sita was to be married to the knight who donated the emblem
 bahut saare raja maharaja us samaaroh main padhaare the
 When many kings tried to put a bow on the bow even after trying, they could not even lift it, then Rama tried to offer the bow by raising Vishwamitra's command
 unki pratyancha chadhaane ke praytn main vah mahaan dhanush ghor dhwani karte hue tut gaya
 When Maharishi Parashurama heard this loud sound, he came there and started expressing anger at his Guru's bow breaking
 lakshmana ugr swabhaav ke the
 He had a dispute with Parashurama
 tab ram ne bich-bachaav kiya
 Thus Sita was married to Rama and was blessed by all people including Parashurama
 ayodhya main ram sita sukhpurvak rahane lage
 People wanted Rama very much
 unki mridul, janasevayukta bhaavana or nyaaypriyata ke kaaran unki vishesh lokapriyata thi
 King Dasharatha was heading towards Vanaprastha

 There was also a pleasant wave in public that their beloved king is about to appoint their beloved prince as king

 Kaikeyi's maid Manthara misleads Kaikeyi that the king is doing wrong with you
 tum raja kii priy rani ho to tumhaari santan ko raja bananaa chahie par raja dasharath ram ko raja bananaa chaahate hai
 a detailed account of Rama's childhood is found in the Balakanda of Swami Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas
 raja dasharath ke teen raniyaan thim: kaushalya, sumitra or kaikeyi
 Ram was the son of Kaushalya, Sumitra had two sons, Lakshmana and Shatrughna and Kaikeyi's son Bharata
 rajya niyamo se raja kaa jyeshtha ladkaa hi raja banane kaa paatr hota he at: ram ko ayodhya kaa raja bananaa nishchit tha
 Kaikeyi who twice saved Dasharatha's life and Dasaratha gave her the boon that she could ask for two brides at any moment of her life
 ram ko raja banate hue or bhavishya ko dekhte hue kaikeyi chaahati thi uskaa putr bharat hi raja bane, isliye unhone raja dasharath dwaara ram ko 14 varsh kaa vanvaas dilaayaa or apane putr bharat ke liye ayodhya kaa rajya maang liya
 In the verses, the king Dasaratha was forced to accept this
 ram ne apane pita kii ajna kaa paalan kiya
 Ram's wife Sita and her brother Lakshmana also went to exile
 vanvaas ke samay, ravan ne sita kaa haran kiya tha
 Ravana was a demon and the king of Lanka
 ramayana ke anusaar, jab ram, sita or lakshmana kutiyaa main the tab ek hiran kii vaani sunakar sita vyakul ho gayi
 That deer was Ravana's maternal uncle Marich
 usne ravan ke kehane par sunahare hiran kaa rup banaaya
 Sita was fascinated to see him and requested Shriram to hunt the deer
 shriram apni bharya kii ichha puri karne chal pade or lakshmana se sita kii raksha karne ko kaha| marich shriram ko bahut dur le gaya
 On getting the opportunity, Shriram shot an arrow and killed the deer Marich
 marate-marate marich ne jor se "he sita! he lakshmana!" kii awaz lagaayi| us awaz ko sun sita chintit ho gayin or unhone lakshmana ko shriram ke paas jane ko kaha| lakshmana janaa nahin chaahate the, par apni bhabhi kii baat ko inkaar na kar sake
 Laxman drew a line before leaving, which is popularly known as Laxman Rekha
 ram, apane bhai lakshmana ke saath sita kii khoj main dar-dar bhatak rahe the
 Then they met two apes named Hanuman and Sugriva
 hanuman, ram ke sabase bade bhakt bane
 In order to reclaim Sita, Bhagavan Rama defeated Hanuman, Vibhishana and the monkey army with the help of Hanuman, Vibhishana and Vanara Sena, and on returning, guided Vibhishan to the good ruler by making him the king of Lanka
 bhagwaan ram ne jab ravan ko yuddh main parrast kiya or uske chote bhai vibhishana ko lanka kaa raja bana diya
 Ram, Sita, Lakshman and some monkeys departed from the Pushpak plane towards Ayodhya
 vahaan sabase milane ke baad ram or sita kaa ayodhya main rajbhishek hua
 The entire state started spending efficient time
