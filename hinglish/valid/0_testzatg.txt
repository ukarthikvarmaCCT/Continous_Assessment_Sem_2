 The patient may be over-optimistic in the mood of the fad; Can have a better perception of himself; The person may be hyper-functional; The patient does not want to sleep or calls it unnecessary, etc
 duusari taraf avsaad kii manodasha main rogi udhaas rahata he; usko thakaan lagati he; apane ko doshi mahasoos karata he yaa usamen aashaheenata dikhaayi detii he
 The mood of such a person changes frequently
 vah kabhi khud ko ekadam se khush mahasoos karata he to ekaek se avsaad kii avasthaa main bhi pahunch jaataa he
 Both states of happiness and sorrow are not normal
 khushi kii is avasthaa ko menic kaha jaataa he

 iske kaaran anya logon kaa unki sthiti ko samaj paanaa mushkil ho jaataa he
 Generally, this condition lasts from a week to a month in adults
 kai maamalon main yah isse kam bhi ho sakati he
 The condition of menic and depression is irregular and its partner is not the same
 yani hameshaa iske lakshan samaan nahin hote
 These appear differently according to each person's personality
 dridhruvi vikaar ke kaaran kuch logon ko drugs or madiraa kii lat lag jaati hai
 Alcohol and drugs prove very harmful for the people suffering from this and make the condition of the person worse, which makes it more difficult for the doctor to treat him
 dridhruvi mood vikaraka ab tak koi sarvamaanya vaigyanik hal saamne nahin aayaa he
 Most scientists hold biochemical, genetic and environmental responsible for this
 aisa mastishk ke rasayanon main asantulan kii vajah se hota he
 An imbalance in the neurotransmitter causes disturbed mood-controlling systems

 If someone's relative has a Dipolar Disorder, then that person's chances of getting it increases to a great extent
 iskaa arth ye bhi nahin nikaalnaa chahie ki ye usko bhi ho jayega
 At the same time, psychologists also consider the environment responsible for this disorder
 parivaar main kisi vyakti kii mrityu, mata-pita kaa talaak or kai anya dardanaak haadason kii vajah se vyakti iskaa shikaar ho jaataa he
 This disorder is also caused by a malfunction in the structure of the brain
 kuch adhyayanon main ye saamne aayaa he ki mendula, prifrantal cartex or hippocampus main gadabadi kii vajah se aisi samasya hoti he
 It can be treated by identifying the Dipolar Mood Disorder

 Children and teenagers do not have the same symptoms as adults, so there is a problem in identifying them
 upachaar karne se pehle tiangers kii vartmaan or bhootkaal ke anubhavon kii padtaal kii jaati he
 Apart from this, information about a person's behavior is also obtained from family members and friends

 tanaav kii paaramparik paribhaasha daihik pratikriya par kendrit he
 Hans Shale discovered the term 'stress' and defined it as an uncertain response based on any body requirement
 hens style kii paribhaasha kaa aadhaar daihik he or yah hormones kii kriyaaon ko adhik mahatv detii he, jo adrinal or anya granthiyon dwaara sravit hote hai
 Shale conceptualized two types of tensions - tanaav par naveen upaagam vyakti ko uplabdh samyoji sansaadhaanon ke sambandh main sthiti ke moolyankan evam vyakhya kii bhoomika par kendrit he
 Interdependent processes of evaluation and adjustment determine the relationship between the environment of the individual and his adaptation

 An event in the environment or something that can cause stress is called 'stress factor' such as excessive workload, earthquake devastation etc
 tanaav ke karkon ko vyapak rup se nimnlikhit virgon main vyavasthit kiya ja saktaa he
 Our responses to stress factors can be divided into broad categories ranging from low sensitivity to serious behavioral changes
 ye pratikriyaayein nimnlikhit virgon main shreneebadv kii gai hai :- When a person encounters obstacles in achieving his / her goal, he / she becomes stressed
 yah aksar vyakti main dwandv or niraashaa kii bhaavana paidaa karata he
 This conflict becomes even more stressful due to severe disappointment
 aamtaur par vyakti dwandv main tab pad jaataa he jab vah paraspar virdohi sthiti kaa saamana karata he
 Depending on the purpose and nature of the situation, a person encounters three types of conflicts in life
 prastaav-prastaav dwandv : is tarah kaa dwandv tab utpann hota he jab kisi vyakti ko do yaa adhik vaanchit uddeshyon main se chunaav karnaa padataa he
 In such a conflict, both goals are desired
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek hi din main do vivaahon ke nimantran main se kisi ek kaa chunaav karnaa
 avoidance-offer Duality: This type of conflict arises when a person has to choose between two or more unwanted goals
 is tarah ke dwandv ko aksar 'ek taraf kuan or duusari taraf khai' vaali sthiti kaha jaataa he
 For example, a youth with low educational qualification will either have to face unemployment or accept a very low income unwanted job
 is tarah kaa dwandv bahut hi gambheer saamanjasy kii samasyaayein utpann karata he, kyonki dwandv kaa samaadhaan karne par bhi chaiyn kii bajaay niraashaa hi utpann hogi
 Proposal-avoidance conflict: In this type of conflict, a person has a strong tendency to both choose the same purpose and reject it
 jaise ki ek yuva saamaajik or suraksha kaarnon se vivaah karnaa chahta he lekin usee sthiti main vah vivaah kii jimmedaariyon or nijee swatantraaa ke khatm ho jane kaa bhay bhi rakhata he
 The solution of such duality is possible only by accepting some negative and positive aspects of the goal
 bahusankhyak vikalpon ke hone ke kaaran kabhi-kabhi prastaav-parihaar dwandv ko "mishrit-anugrah" dvandvon ke sandarbh main bhi dekha jaataa he
 Frustration: Frustration is an experimental condition that results from certain causes such as avrodh va baadhaaen bhautik evam saamaajik donon prakaar kii ho sakati hai or ye vyakti main niraashaa yaa kuntha kaa bhav utpann karti hai
 In this, accident, unhealthy interpersonal relationship, death of the beloved
 vyaktigat abhilakshan jaise shaareerik viklaangata, apurna yogyata or aatmanushasan kaa abhaav bhi kuntha kii jad he
 There are some simple frustrations that often lead to certain difficulties

 Indra taught Dhanvantari
 kaashi ke raja divodas dhanvantari ke avatar kahe gaye hai
 Sushruta went to read Ayurveda by visiting her

 These eight parts are the following: is ashtang ayurveda ke antargat dehatatva, sharir vigyaan, shastravidya, bheshaj or dravya gun tatva, chikitsa tatva or dhatri vidya bhi he

 Therefore, we can say that the creation of Ayurveda dates back to 3,000 to 50,000 years BC, ie, with or around the origin of creation
 ayurveda ke aitihaasik gyaan ke sandarbh main sarvapratham gyaan kaa ullekh, charak mat ke anusaar mrityulok main ayurveda ke avataran ke saath- agnivesh kaa namollekh he
 First Prajapati from Brahma, Ashwini Kumar from Prajapati, Indra from him and Bhardwaj from Indra studied Ayurveda
 chyavan rishi kaa kaarykaal bhi ashvini kumaron kaa samakaleen mana gaya he
 Rishi Chyavan has a very important contribution in the development of Ayurveda
 phir bharadwaj ne ayurveda ke prabhaav se deergh sukhi or aarogy jivan praapt kar anya rishiyon main uskaa prachaar kiya
 Subsequently Punarvasu Atreya preached Ayurveda to six disciples named Agnivesh, Bhel, Jatu, Parashar, Harit and Ksharpani
 in chah shishyon main sabase adhik budhimaan agnivesh ne sarvapratham ek samhita kaa nirmaan kiya- agnivesh tantra kaa jiskaa pratisanskaar baad main charak ne kiya or uskaa naam charakasamhita padaa, jo ayurveda kaa aadhaar stambh he
 According to Sushruta, Sasruta, along with other Maharishrias, came to Lord Dhanvantari, who appeared in the form of Kashiraj Divodas, and applied to him to study Ayurveda
 us samay bhagwaan dhanvantari ne un logon ko upadesh karte hue kaha ki sarvapratham swayan brahma ne sristi utpaadan purv hi atharvaveda ke upved ayurveda ko ek sahasr adhyay- shat sahasr shlokon main prakashit kiya or punah manushya ko alpamedhaavi samajhakar ise aath angon main vibhakt kar diya
 In this way, Dhanvantari has also considered the publication of Ayurveda as propounded by Brahmadev itself
 punah bhagwaan dhanvantari ne kaha ki brahma se daksh prajapati, unase ashvinikumar dway tathaa unase indra ne ayurveda kaa adhyayan kiya
 The history of Ayurveda is mainly divided into three parts - samhitakaal kaa samay 5veen shatee i
pus
 se 6veen shatee tak mana jaataa he
 This period was the era of the original creations of Ayurveda
 is samay aacharyo ne apni pratibha tathaa anubhav ke bal par bhinn-bhinn angon ke vishay main apane pandityapurna granthon kaa pranayan kiya
 The era of the rise of the Trimuni - Charak, Sushruta and Vagbhata of Ayurveda is also the Samhidakala
 charak samhita granth ke madhyam se kaaychikitsa ke kshetra main adbhut safalataa is kaal kii ek pramukh visheshta he
 Its time has been considered from 7th century to 15th century and this period is known for criticisms and commentators
 is kaal main samhitakaal kii rachanaaon ke upar tikaakaron ne praudh or swasth vyakhyaayen nirupit kin
 The Sushruta Samhita Tika of Acharya Dalhan of this time is considered very important in Ayurveda world
 shodh granth ‘rasratnasamucchy’ bhi isi kaal kii rachana he, jise acharya vagbhat ne charak or sushrut samhita or anek rasshastragyon kii rachana ko aadhaar banaakar likhaa he
 The time of this period is considered from the 14th century to the modern period
 yah kaal vishisht vishyon par granthon kii rachanaaon kaa kaal rahaa he
 The texts like Madhavnidan, Jawardarpan etc
 were also written in this period
 chikitsa ke vibhinn prarupon par bhi is kaal main vishesh dhyaan diya gaya, jo ki vartmaan main bhi praasangik he
 During this period, Ayurveda is being expanded and used on a very large scale
 spasht he ki ayurveda kii pracheenta vedon ke kaal se hi siddh he
 Social medicine is considered a new ideology in modern medicine, but it is not a new ideology but it is just a repetition of it, which has been mentioned in Ayurveda even before 2500 years
 ayurveda kaa uddeshy hi swasth praani ke swasthya kii raksha tathaa rogi kii rog se raksha he
 
 ayurveda ke do uddeshy hai : For this, considering the country, time etc
 suited to your body and nature, regular dieting, gestures, exercise, defecation, bathing, sleeping, awakening, etc
, to follow scriptural routines, nighttime and seasonal habits useful for household life, through hazardous tasks Avoiding, doing every task judiciously, keeping the mind and senses under control, according to the circumstances of the country, time, etc
 Doing some work, not stopping the present velocities of feces, urine, etc
, avoiding jealousy, malice, greed, ego etc
, purification of the body from time to time by using vomit, purgation etc
 to remove accumulated impurities in the body
 Doing, observing virtue and properly following the teachings of medical practitioners in epidemics arising out of the effects of contaminated air, water, country and time, saving clean and clear water, air, food etc
 Do not do it and motivate others too, these are the means of health protection
 iske liye prayek rog ke These three are called the 'triskandha' of Ayurveda
 iskaa vistrut vivechan ayurveda granthon main kiya gaya he
 Only a brief introduction will be given here
 kintu iske purv aayu ke prayek sanghatak kaa sankshipt parichay aavashyak he, kyonki sanghatakon ke gyaan ke bina unamem honevaale vikaron ko jaananaa sambhav na hoga
 The meaning of Ayurveda is very broad according to the interpretation of the ancient masters and the meanings of these two words 'ayu' and 'veda'
 ayurveda ke aacharyon ne 'sharir, indriya, man tathaa aatma ke sanyog' ko aayu kaha he
 That is, as long as there are many differences of age according to these four assets or misfortune, but in essence it is considered to be of four types: sukhaayu : kisi prakaar ke shiririk yaa maansik vikaas se rahit hote hue, gyaan, vigyaan, bal, paurush, dhanri dhaany, yash, parijan aadi sadhano se samrudh vyakti ko "sukhaayu' kehete hai
 Dukhayu: On the contrary, despite having all the means, a person suffering from physical or mental illness or without being sick, a person without means or health and resources, is called "grief"
 hitayu : swasthya or sadhano se sampann hote hue yaa unamem kuch kami hone par bhi jo vyakti vivek, sadachaar, sushiltaa, udaartaa, satya, ahimsa, shanti, paroapkaar aadi aadi gunon se yukt hote hai or samaaj tathaa lok ke kalyaan main nirat rahete hai unhen hitayu kehete hai
 Ahitayu: On the contrary, those who are imprudent, misdemeanor, cruelty, selfishness, arrogance, atrocities, etc
, have bad qualities and are a curse for society and the people
 is prakaar hit, ahit, sukh or du:kha, aayu ke ye chaar bhed hai
 Similarly, according to Kaalpramana, longevity, middle age and short age, in essence these are three distinctions
 vaise in teenon main bhi anek bhedon kii kalpana kii ja sakati he
 The word 'veda' also has the meaning of power, profit, speed, thought, attainment and knowledge, and the age Veda is called Ayurveda
 arthath jis shaastra main aayu ke swaroop, aayu ke vividh bhed, aayu ke liye hitkaarak or apramaan tathaa unke gyaan ke sadhano kaa evam aayu ke upadanbhoot sharir, indriya, man or aatma, inamen sabhi yaa kisi ek ke vikaas ke saath hit, sukh or deergh aayu kii prapti ke sadhano kaa tathaa inke baadhak vishyon ke niraakaran ke upayon kaa vivchen ho use ayurveda kehete hai
 But nowadays Ayurveda "ancient Indian medical system" is used in this narrow sense
 samast cheshtaaon, indriyon, man ore aatma ke aadharbhoot paanchabhautik pind ko 'sharir' kehete hai
 The human body has six organs in its gross form; Two arms, two legs, head and cervix, and one interstitial
 in angon ke avyavon ko pratyang kehete hai- According to Ayurveda, there are 300 bones in the whole body, which nowadays are considered to be two hundred and six only due to the number of spheres and there are 200 joints, muscles 900, veins 700, arteries 24 and their branches 200, muscles 500 and subtle sources 30,956
 ayurveda ke anusaar sharir main ras, rakt, maance, med, asthi, majja or shukr, ye saat dhaatuen hai
 As a result, they are also decayed due to their use in various functions, but the various substances we take as food and drink not only compensate for this damage, but also confirm the metals
 aaharroop main liya hua padaarth pachakagni, bhutagni or vibhinn dhatvanignyon dwaara paripakv hokar anek parivartanon ke baad purvokt dhaatuon ke rup main parinat hokar in dhaatuon kaa poshan karata he
 In this digestion, the essence part of the diet is nourished by the juices and from the remaining part of the kitta, feces and urine are formed
 yah ras hriday se hota hua shiraaon dwaara saare sharir main pahunchakar prayek dhaatu or ang ko poshan pradaan karata he
 Blood is also nourished by the essence of the metal, juice etc
 on digestion from the metals, and the nourishment of the body is produced from the kitta part, like phlegm from the juice; Blood bile; Stool coming out of the nose through the flesh, ears and eyes; Fattening from sweat; Mud from the bone to the hair and follicle and from the marrow are formed in the form of mud
 shukr main koi mel nahin hota, uske saare bhaag se oj kii utpatti hoti he
 Many micronutrients are also produced from these metallic metals, such as milk from juice, tendons and veins from blood, fat from flesh, skin and its six or seven levels, fattening from muscles, teeth from bone, hair from marrow and oozes from Venus
 Namely substrates are produced
 ye dhaatuen or upadhaatuen vibhinn avyavon main vibhinn roopon main sthit hokar sharir kii vibhinn kriyaaon main upyogi hoti hai
 As long as they remain in the proper quantity and form and their action remains natural, the body remains healthy and when they are in low or high and distorted form, disease is produced in the body
 pracheen darshanik sinddhant ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi sthool padaarth prithvi, jal, tej, vaayu or akaash in paanch mahabhuton ke sanyukt hone se banate hai
 They have different forms due to the difference in their proportions
 isi prakaar sharir ke samast dhaatu, upadhatu or mel paanchabhautik hai
 As a result, all the components of the body and hence the whole body are five physical
 ye sabhi achetan hai
 When there is a coincidence of the soul in them, then there is also consciousness in their consciousness
 uchit paristhiti main shuddh raj or shuddh veery kaa sanyog hone or usamen aatma kaa sanchaar hone se mata ke garbhashay main sharir kaa aarambh hota he
 This is called womb
 mata ke aaharajanit rakt se aparaa or garbhanaadi ke dwaara, jo naabhi se lagi rahati he, garbh poshan praapt karata he
 It gets nourishment by being immersed in the contraceptive and also gets nourishment in the first month and cubes in the second month? In the third month, the development of the organ afferent begins
 chauthe maas main usamen adhik sthirataa aa jaati he tathaa garbh ke lakshan mata main spasht rup se dikhaai padane lagate hai
 In this way, it develops progressively in the mother's body, when the whole organ, consisting of elements and components, often comes out of the Kukshi in the ninth month and takes birth as a new creature
 sharir main prayek ang yaa kisi bhi avyav kaa nirmaan uddeshivishesh se hi hota he, arthath prayek avyav ke dwaara vishisht kaaryon kii siddhi hoti he, jaise haath se pakadana, pair se chalanaa, mukh se khaanaa, daant se chabana aadi
 There are also some components that perform many functions and there are some that carry out a specific function
 jinase kaarivishesh hi hota he unamem us kaary ke liye shaktisampann ek vishisht sookshm rachana hoti he
 This is called sense
 shabd, sparsh, rup, ras or gandh in bahya vishyon kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye krmanusaar kaan, twachaa, netra, jihva or nasika ye avyav indriashray avyav kehalaate hai or inamen sthit vishisht shaktisampann sookshm vastu ko indriya kehete hai
 These are five respectively in sookshm avyavon main panchmahabhuton main se us mahabhoot kii visheshta rahati he jiske shabd aadi vishisht gun hai; jaise shabd ke liye shroatra indriya main akaash, sparsh ke liye tvak indriya main vaayu, rup ke liye chakshu indriya main tej, ras ke liye rasanendriya main jal or gandh ke liye ghranendriya main prithvi tatv
 These five senses are called Gyanendriyas
 inke atirikt vishisht kaarysampadan ke liye paanch camendriyaan bhi hoti hai, jaise gaman ke liye pair, grahan ke liye haath, bolne ke liye jihva, malatyag ke liye guda or mutratyag tathaa santanotpaadan ke liye shishn 
 Like philosophers, Ayurveda considers the senses not egoistic, but physical
 in indriyon kii apane kaaryon man kii prerana se hi pravriti hoti he
 It remains inactive when there is no contact with the mind
 prayek praani ke sharir main atyant sookshm or keval ek man hota he
 It is extremely quick and is the controller of every sense
 kintu yah swayan bhi aatma ke sampark ke bina achetan hone se niskriy rahata he
 In spite of all these three natural qualities, Sattva, Raja and Tama in the mind of each person, one of them usually prevails and accordingly the person is Satvik, Rajas or Tamas, but from time to time, diet, ethics and Due to the influence of circumstances, other qualities also become dominant
 iskaa gyaan pravritiyon ke lakshanon dwaara hota he, yatha raag-dwesh-shunya yatharthadrashtaa man satvik, ragayukt, sachesht or chanchal man rajas or aalasy, dirghsutrata evam niskriyata aadi yukt man taamas hota he
 That is why Satvik mind is considered pure, sattva or natural and Raja and Tama are called its defects
 aatma se chetanta praapt kar prakritik yaa sadosh man apane gunon ke anusaar indriyon ko apane-apane vishyon main pravrutt karata he or usee ke anuroop shaareerik kaary hote hai
 The soul moves the senses and the senses through the mind, because the mind is its cause
 isiilie man kaa sampark jis indriya ke saath hota he usee ke dwaara gyaan hota he, duusare ke dwaara nahin
 Because the mind is subtle on one side, it is not possible to have contact with multiple senses simultaneously
 phir bhi uski gati itani teevr he ki vah ek ke baad duusari indriya ke sampark main shighrata se parivartit hota he, jisase hamen yahi gyaat hota he ki sabhi ke saath uskaa sampark he or sab kaary ek saath ho rahe hai, kintu vastav main aisa nahin hota
 The soul is panchabhumta and different from the mind, is conscious, formless and continual and is a witness form, because itself is devoid and passive
 iske sampark se sakriy kintu achetan man, indriyon or sharir main chetana kaa sanchaar hota he or ve sachesht hote hai
 There is no sign, form, color, shape etc
 in the soul, but without it the body remains inactive due to being unconscious and is called dead and its contact brings consciousness to it, then it is called alive and has many natural actions
 Looks like; Such as shortness of breath, enlarging from small and severed wounds etc
, opening and closing of eyelids, signs of life, movement of mind, knowledge from one sense to another effect, different senses and elements tend to different functions
 To take and hold subjects, to reach from one place to another in the dream, to experience the object seen with one eye with the other eye
 ichha, dwesh, sukh, du:kha, praytn, dhairya, buddhi, samaran shakti, ahankaar aadi sharir main aatma ke hone par hi hote hai; atmarahit mrit sharir main nahin hote
 Therefore, these are called the symptoms of the soul, that is, the soul can be estimated only from the aforesaid symptoms
 maansik kalpana ke atirikt kisi duusari indriya se uskaa pratyaksh karnaa sambhav nahin he
 This soul, despite being perpetual, formless and comprehensive, acts as a result of the predetermined auspicious or inauspicious deeds in the vagina or in the body, the way the mind and senses and subjects come into contact
 uttarottar ashubh kaaryon ke karne se uttarottar adhogati hoti he tathaa shubh karmon ke dwaara uttarottar unnati hone se, man ke raag-dwesh-hin hone par, moksh kii prapti hoti he
 It is clear from this description that the soul is immaterial, but there can be distortions in the mind, senses and body, and because of these three being mutual, the disorder of one can affect the other
 at: inhen prakrutistha rakhana yaa vikrut hone par prakruti main laana yaa swasth karnaa paramaavashyak he
 This leads to long happiness and Hitayu, which respectively helps the soul to get rid of its sole, but also severe, birth death and diseases like bhavabandhan, which is said to be a natural medicine in Ayurveda
 charak ne sankshep main rog or aarogy kaa lakshan yah likhaa he- Sushruta has given the detail of a healthy person in detail- iske vipareet lakshan hon to aswasth samajhnaa chahie
 The disease is also called pathology or disorder
 at: sharir, indriya or man ke prakritik rup yaa kriya main vikruti hona rog he
 The synonym for the cause of the disease is 'diagnosis'
 jab kisi aahaar yaa vihaar se sharir par rog pradurbhaav dikhalaae tab use nidaan kehete hai
 All the things in the world have some kind of definite effect on the body, senses and mind from the person or tradition and due to improper or adverse effects, they cause disorder and cause diseases
 in sabakaa vistrut vivechan kathin he, at: sankshep main inhen teen virgon main baant diya gaya he : Prajnapraadh: Consuming a subject without knowing or knowing an inappropriate item without considering loss of profit due to indiscretion, impatience and prior experience and neglect of reality
 isi ko duusare or spasht shabdon main karm kaa hin, mithyaa or ati yoga bhi kehete hai
 Asmatyendriyarthsayog: Incidental coincidence of the senses with their own forms, etc
, causes the disorder of the senses, body and mind; As if not to look with eyes, to see very bright objects and to see too much and to see very subtle, narrow, very distant and terrible, ungodly, and disordered things
 ye chakshurindriya or uske aashray netron ke saath man or sharir main bhi vikaar utpann karte hai
 This is also called misuse of meaning in other words
 greeshm, varsha, sheet aadi rituon tathaa balya, yuva or vriddhavasthaon kaa bhi sharir aadi par prabhaav padataa hi he, kintu inke hin, mithyaa or atiyog kaa prabhaav vishesh rup se hanikar hota he
 Variations of the aforesaid causes also lead to other distinctions; As prakarantar se inke anya do bhed hote hai- All these reasons have three types of effects on the body: doshapracope- anek kaarnon se sharir ke upadanbhoot akaash aadi paanch tatwon main se kisi ek yaa anek main parivartan hokar unke swaabhaavik anupaat main antar aa janaa anivaary he
 Keeping this in mind, Ayurveda has divided these disorders into vata, pitta and phlegm
 panchmahabhoot evam tridosh kaa alag se vivechan hi uchit he, kintu sankshep main yah samajhnaa chahie ki sansar ke jitne bhi moort padaarth hai ve sab akaash, vaayu, tej, jal or prithvi in paanch tatwon se bane hai
 These earth etc
 are not the ones that we get to see in the gross world every day
 ye pichley sab to purvokt paanchon tatwon ke sanyog se utpann paanchabhautik hai
 Elements that have a plurality in objects are described by the same names
 usee prakaar hamaare sharir kii dhaatuon main yaa unke sanghatakon main jis tatv kii bahulata rahati he ve usee shrenee ke gine jate hai
 Of these five, the sky is formless and the earth is the most gross and the shelter of all
 jo kuch bhi vikaas yaa parivartan hote hai unka prabhaav isi par spasht rup se padataa he
 The remaining three are capable of causing all kinds of changes or disorders
 at: teenon kii prachurtaa ke aadhaar par, vibhinn dhaatuon evam unke sanghatakon ko vaat, pitt or kaph kii sangya di gai he
 In general, these three metals also contaminate other metals when they are deformed due to their nutritional value
 at: dosha tathaa mel rup hone se mel kehalaati hai
 There is a deficiency or excess of these three due to any reason in the disease, which is called defect
 dhatudushan- kuch padaarth yaa kaaran aise hote hai jo kisi vishisht dhaatu yaa avyav main hi vikaar karte hai
 They do not affect the whole body
 inhen dhatupradooshak kehete hai
 Aphrodisiac- Those substances which cause special disorder in a particular metal or organ, despite incurring the vata etc
 doshas all over the body, are called amphibia
 kintu in teenon main jo parivartan hote hai ve vaat, pitt yaa kaph in teenon main se kisi ek, do yaa teenon main hi vikaar utpann karte hai
 Therefore, these three doshas are the main body causes, because the changes in their natural proportions also cause distortion in the metals of the body
 rachana main vikaar hone se kriya main bhi vikaar hona swaabhaavik he
 Symptoms like diarrhea, rashes etc
 arise as a result of this unnatural design and action and only a group of these symptoms is called disease
 is prakaar jin padaarthon ke prabhaav se vaat aadi dosha main vikrutiyaan hoti hai tathaa ve vaataadi dosha, jo shaareerik dhaatuon ko vikrut karte hai, donon hi hetu yaa nidaan kehalaate hai
 Ultimately, it is necessary to consider two other important distinctions: purvokt kaarnon se utpann vikaron kii pahchaan jin sadhano dwaara hoti he unhen ling kehete hai
 It has four distinctions: preform, form, attainment and upanayana
 purvarup- kisi rog ke vyakt hone ke purv sharir ke bheetar hui atyalp yaa aarambhik vikruti ke kaaran jo lakshan utpann hokar kisi rogvishesh kii utpatti kii sambhaavna prakat karte hai unhen purvarup kehete hai
 Roop - The symptoms that give a clear introduction to disease or pathology are called Roop
 samprapti : kis kaaran se koun sa dosha swatantra rup main yaa paratantr rup main, akele yaa duusare ke saath, kitne ansh main or kitni maatra main prakupit hokar, kis dhaatu yaa kis ang main, kis-kis swaroop kaa vikaar utpann karata he, iske nirdhaaran ko samprapti kehete hai
 This has important utility in medicine
 vastut: in parivartanon se hi jvaradi rup main rog utpann hote hai, at: inhen hi vastav main rog bhi kaha ja saktaa he or inhen parivartanon ko dhyaan main rakhkar kii gai chikitsa bhi safal hoti he
 Excision and supplementation - when there is a doubt in deciding the actual causes or forms of diseases due to deficiency or narrowness etc
, then to overcome that doubt, one of the possible defects or disorders is to avoid appropriate disorders of dieting and medicine
 In the discussion of anabolism which benefits from using it, Ayurvadacharyo has given six types of dietary and drug experiments, giving the formula of 18 distinctions of Upasya
 Is described
 ye sutara itane mahatv ke hai ki inamen se ek-ek ke aadhaar par ek-ek chikitsapaddati kaa udai ho gaya he; jaise, Appendicitis and appendicitis also help in the identification of disease
 at: inako bhi pracheenon ne "ling' main hi gina he
 Proper and successful treatment is possible only for acquiring knowledge of disease through sex and sex
 hetu or lingon se rog kii pariksha hoti he, kintu inke samuchit gyaan ke liye rogi kii pariksha kerani chahie
 The means of patient examination are four - Optology, Direct, Estimate and Tip
 yogya adhikari, tap or gyaan se sampann hone ke kaaran, shastratatvon ko raag-dwesh-shunya buddhi se asandigdh or yatharth rup se jaanate or kehete hai
 Such scholars, research, experienced, non-partisan and real speakers are known to the great men and their words or writings are called optopadesh
 aaptjanon ne purna pariksha ke baad shastron kaa nirmaan kar unamem ek-ek ke sambandh main likhaa he ki amuk kaaran se, is dosha ke prakupit hone or is dhaatu ke dooshit hone tathaa is ang main ashrith hone se, amuk lakshanonvala amuk rog utpann hota he, usamen amuk-amuk parivartan hote hai tathaa uski chikitsa ke liye in aahaar vihaar or amuk aushadhiyon ke is prakaar upyog karne se tathaa chikitsa karne se shanti hoti he
 Therefore, after studying scripture from first qualified and experienced gurus, there is a tendency for disease, gender and medicine
 shaastravachanon ke anusaar hi lakshanon kii pariksha pratyaksh, anumaan or yukti se kii jaati he
 Psychologically, the senses are said to experience subjects directly
 iske dwaara rogi ke sharir ke ang pratyang main honevaale vibhinn shabdon kii pariksha kar unke swaabhaavik yaa aswabhaavik hone kaa gyaan shrotrendriya dwaara karnaa chahie
 Knowledge of color, shape, length, width, etc
, and knowledge of shadows etc
 should be acquired by the eyes, knowledge of smells, olfactory and sensation of cold, hot, rough, balsamic and pulse, etc
 by the sensory
 rogi ke sharirgat ras kii pariksha swayan apni jeebh se karnaa uchit na hone ke kaaran, uske sharir yaa usase nikle swead, mutr, rakt, pus aadi main cheentee laganaa yaa na laganaa, mackhiyon kaa aana or na aana, coy yaa kute aadi dwaara khaanaa yaa na khaanaa, pratyaksh dekhakar unke swaroop kaa anumaan kiya ja saktaa he
 Knowledge gained through rational reasoning is inference
 jin vishyon kaa pratyaksh nahin ho saktaa yaa pratyaksh hone par bhi unke sambandh main andeh hota he vahaan anumaan dwaara pariksha kerani chahie; yatha, pachanshkti ke aadhaar par agnibal kaa, vyaayaam kii shakti ke aadhaar par shaareerik bal kaa, apane vishyon ko grahan karne yaa na karne se indriyon kii prakruti yaa vikruti kaa tathaa isi prakaar bhojan main ruchi, aruchi tathaa pyaas evam bhay, shok, krodh, ichha, dwesh aadi maansik bhaavon ke dwaara vibhinn shaareerik or maansik vishyon kaa anumaan karnaa chahie
 The aforesaid subunit is also a matter of conjecture
 iskaa arth he yojana
 Seeing the origin of a specific work from the community influence of many causes, what is imagined by the corresponding ideas is called yukti
 jaise khet, jal, jutai, beej or ritu ke sanyog se hi paudha ugta he
 Smoke is always associated with fire, that is, where there is smoke there will be fire
 isi ko vyaptigyaan bhi kehete hai or isi ke aadhaar par tark kar anumaan kiya jaataa he
 In this way, the diagnosis, form, form, acquisition and treatment of all these community considerations justifies the decision of the disease
 yojana kaa duusari drushti se bhi rogi kii pariksha main prayog kar sakate hai
 For example, if a subject is not easily admissible in any sense, it is also intrinsic in the device to accept that subject with the help of other mechanical devices
 purvokt lingon ke gyaan ke liye tathaa roganirnay ke saath saadhyataa yaa asaadhyataa ke bhi gyaan ke liye aptopadesh ke anusaar pratyaksh aadi parikshaon dwaara rogi ke saar, tatv, sahanan, pramaan, satmya, aaharshakti, vyaayaamashakti tathaa aayu ke atirikt varna, swar, gandh, ras or sparsh ye vishay, shroatra, chakshu, ghran, rasan or spashendriya, satv, bhakthi, shaich, sheel, aachaar, smriti, akruti, bal, glani, tandra, aarambh, guruta, laghutaa, sheetaltaa, ushnata, mriduta, kaathinya aadi gun, aahaar ke gun, pachan or maatra, upaay, rog or uske purvarup aadi kaa pramaan, updrav, chaaya, pratichhaya, swapn, rogi ko dekhne ko bulaane ke liye aae doot tathaa raste or rogi ke ghar main pravesh ke samay ke shakun or apshakun, grahyog aadi sabhi vishyon kaa prakruti tathaa vikruti kii drushti se vichaar karte hue pariksha kerani chahie
 Especially pulse, stool, urine, tongue, word, touch, eye and shape should be carefully examined
 ayurveda main naadee kii pariksha ati mahatv kaa vishay he
 Only by examining the pulse, the knowledge of the nature of diseases, etc
, along with defects and witchcraft, is attained by experienced physicians
 jin sadhano ke dwaara rogon ke karanbhoot dosha evam shaareerik vikrutiyon kaa shaman kiya jaataa he unhen aushadh kehete hai
 These are mainly of two types: wasteful and liquid
 adravyabhoot aushadh vah he jisamen kisi dravya kaa upyog nahin hota, jaise upwas, vishram, sona, jaagnaa, tahalnaa, vyaayaam aadi
 External substances used in the body by external or internal experiments are liquid medicine
 ye dravya sankshep main teen prakaar ke hote hai : Like the body, all these matter are also five physical, they also have the components which belong to the body
 at: sansar main koi bhi dravya aisa nahin he jiskaa kisi na kisi rup main kisi na kisi rog ke kisi na kisi avasthavishesh main aushadharup main prayog na kiya ja sake
 But before using them, knowledge of their natural properties, ritualistic properties, method and experiment is necessary
 inamen kuch dravya dosha kaa shaman karte hai, kuch dosha or dhaatu ko dooshit karte hai or kuch swasthvruth main, arthath dhaatusamya ko sthir rakhane main upyogi hote hai, inaki upyogita ke samuchit gyaan ke liye dravyon ke paanchabhautik sanghatakon main taratamya ke anusaar swaroop, guruta, laghutaa, rukshata, snigdhata aadi gun, ras, vapak, veery, prabhaav tathaa maatra kaa gyaan aavashyak hota he
 Not all matter is always useful in the body in its natural forms
 rog or rogi kii aavashyaktaa ke vichaar se sharir kii dhaatuon ke liye upyogi evam satmyakaran ke anukool banane ke liye; in dravyon ke swaabhaavik swaroop or gunon main parivartan ke liye, vibhinn bhautik evam rasinic sanskaron dwaara jo upaay kiye jate hai unhen "kalpana' kehete hai
 Such as Swaras, Kalk or Churna, Cold Booth, Booth, Infusion and Arishta, Oil, Ghrita, Avleh etc
 and refining of minerals, etc
 chikitsak, parichaayak, aushadh or rogi, ye chaaron milakar shaareerik dhaatuon kii samta ke uddeshy se jo kuch bhi upaay yaa kaary karte hai use chikitsa kehete hai
 It is of two types: preventive and prohibitive; Just as the natural defects and metals of the body are not dissimilar and the tradition of equilibrium should remain constant, the therapy done for this purpose is preventive and the actions or remedies which create symmetry in the disordered body metals are called prohibitive therapies
 pun: chikitsa teen prakaar kii hoti he : It is clearly mentioned in the Gita - Mind and human cause, Bandhamokshyo: 7 - If not only mental, but also in the treatment of many physical diseases, if a human being is motivated, then there is hopeless success
 isamen man ko ahit vishyon se rokna tathaa harshan, aashwaasan aadi upaay hai
 Many people have defeated serious diseases on the strength of their self-confidence
 atev ek safal chikitsak rogi ke aatmbal ko viksit karne kaa prayaas karata he
 In this, these measures are like devaradhan, chanting, havan, puja, recitation, vrat, and wearing of gem, mantra, yantra, gemstone and medicine, etc
, as a result of suppression of defects etc
 rog or rogi ke bal, swaroop, avasthaa, swasthya, satv, prakruti aadi ke anusaar upyukat aushadh kii uchit maatra, anukool kalpana aadi kaa vichaar kar prayukt karnaa
 There are also three main types of it: internal scouring, external scouring, and weapons
 iske bhi do mukhya prakaar hai : The remedies for excluding physical defects are called Shodhan, its five remedies, Virechan, Vasti, Anusana and Uttravasti, Shirovirechan and Raktamokshan, these are the five measures
 shaman-lakshanik chikitsa : vibhinn lakshanon ke anusaar dosha or vikaron ke shamanarth vishesh gunwali aushadhi kaa prayog, jaise jvaranashak, chhardighn, atisarhar, uddipak, pachak, hridy, kushtaghn, balya, vishaghn, kashar, shwasahar, dahprashamak, sheetaprashamak, mutral, mutravishodhak, shukrajanak, shukravishodhak, stanyajanak, swedal, raktasthapak, vednahar, sangyaasthaapak, vay:sthaapak, jeevaneey, brunhniya, lekhneey, medneey, rukshneey, snaheneey aadi dravyon kaa aavashyaktaanusaar uchit kalpana or maatra main prayog karnaa
 The following things should be kept in mind while using these medicines: jaise abhyang, snaan, lep, dhupan, swedan aadi
 In different stages, one or several of the following eight types of weapons have to be performed: inke atirikt utpaatan, kuttan, manthan, dahan aadi upshastrkarm bhi hote hai
 Preparation before the preamble is called premedication, such as the patient’s refinement, preparation, purification of instruments, weapons, and the necessary cotton, cloth, bandage, melted butter, oil, decoction, coat etc
 during and after the armament
 vaastavik shastrkarm ko pradhan karm kehete hai
 After shakarma, refinement, Rohan, planting, dermatization, achromatization, Romogenesis etc
 are the remedies
 shastrasadhay tathaa anya anek rogon main kshar yaa agnipryog ke dwaara bhi chikitsa kii ja sakati he
 Leech, horny, tubi, pruning and venation are used to extract blood
 man bhi aayu kaa upadan he
 When the mind of the aforesaid Raja and Tama are corrupted by these two doshas, deteriorating mental balance also has an effect on the senses and body
 sharir or indriyon ke swasth hone par bhi manodosh se manushya ke jivan main astavyastata aane se aayu kaa hraas hota he
 For his treatment, due to the formation of the mind, along with physical purification, etc
, knowledge, science, self-control, psychomotor, healing, reassurance, etc
 should be treated
 man ko kshobhak aahaar-vihaar aadi se bachanaa chahie tathaa maanas-rog-visheshgyon se upachaar karana chahie
 The senses - they are considered physical in Ayurveda
 ye sharirashrith tathaa manoniyantrit hoti hai
 Therefore, their diseases are treated on the basis of body and mind
 aatma ko pehle hi nirvikaar bataaya gaya he
 We have a feeling of disorder in the governing soul of all these, if there are disorders in its means and basis
 kintu purvakrit ashubh karmon parinamswaroop aatma ko bhi vividh yoniyon main janmagrahan aadi bhavabandhanrupi rog se bachaane ke liye, iske pradhan upkaran man ko shuddh karne ke liye, satsangati, gyaan, vairaygy, dharamshastrachinthan, vrath, upwas aadi karnaa chahie
 With this and yama-niyam, etc
 Yoga is practiced, due to the creation of memory, salvation is attained through rituals
 ise naishthiki chikitsa kehete hai
 Because the world is duality, where there is happiness there is sorrow as well, so the ultimate happiness is only when duality is free and that is called salvation
 vistrut vivechan, vishesh chikitsa tathaa sugamawa aadi ke liye ayurveda ko aath bhaagon main vibhakt kiya gaya he : ye aath ang ye hai- kaaychikitsa, shalyatantra, shalakyatantra, comarbhrity, agadtantra, bhootvidya, rasayanatantr or vajikaran
 It is usually treated by drug use
 pradhanat: fever, raktpitta, shosh, unmaad, apsmaar, kusht, prameh, atisar aadi rogon kii chikitsa iske antargat aati he
 The Shastrakar has defined it as- vividh prakaar ke shalyon ko nikaalane kii vidhi evam agni, kshar, yantra, shastr aadi ke prayog dwaara sampadit chikitsa ko shalya chikitsa kehete hai
 Removal of parts of trunk, pieces of wood, pieces of stone, dust, iron pieces, bone, hair, nails, surgery, unclean blood, poo, dead bones etc
 from any ulcer and the use of instruments and weapons and diagnosis of ulcers, And its treatment etc
 have been included under surgery
 gale ke upar ke angon kii chikitsa main bahudhaa shalaka sadrush yantron evam shastron kaa prayog hone se ise shaalakyayantra kehete hai

 yah film khosla-sadhana kii saspans filmon kii kadi main anttim film he
 Earlier both of them had created who she was and created my shadow
 is film ke mukhya kalakaar sadhana evam manoj kumaar hai
 Neeraj and Anita love each other but this is not liked by Anita's father as Anita is a girl from a well-to-do family while Neeraj does a minor job
 anitha niraj ko registerd vivaah ke liye lekar jaati he lekin vahaan uske pita aa jate hai or anitha ko dhamkee dete hai ki yadi usne register par hastakshar kiye to anjaam bahut bura hoga
 Anita leaves from there without signing it
 niraj uske ghar jaataa he lekin anitha usase baat karne se manaa kar detii he
 At that time, a person named Anil Sharma comes to Anita's house, who is introduced to Anita's father Neeraj by saying that he is a very big businessman of the city and now Anita's fiance
 niraj maayoos hokar apana tabadalaa dilli kara letaa he

 The ruin of his Moscow campaign has become famous in history
 paris lautakar nepolian ne pun: ek sena ekatra kii kintu lipatsig main use phir prasha, rus or austria kii sanmilit senaaon ne haraaya

 Napoleon Bonaparte took reforms in various areas in 1799 to consolidate his position in power and provide administrative stability to France
 vastutah diarectory ke shashan ko samaapt kar nepalian ne satta kii thi or france kii janata ne us parivartan ko sweekaar kiya tha to iskaa kaaran tha vah araajaktaa or avyavashtha se ub chuki thi
 Therefore, it was necessary for Napoleon to establish a well-organized governance and law and order in the interior
 pratham counsal banane ke baad nepolian ne france ke liye ek naveen samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya jo kranti yug kaa chauthaa samvidhan tha
 Through this, executive power was vested in three counselors
 pradhan counsal ko anya counsalaron se adhik shakti praapt thi
 In fact, the Republic certainly showed in the Constitution, but the entire power of the state was concentrated in the hands of Nepalis
 nepolian ne shashan vyavastha kaa kenndrikaran kiya or departments tathaa district kii sthaneey sarkaron ko samaapt kar prefect evam sab-prefects kii niyukti kii
 Their appointment and the appointment of all the mayors of villages and cities were directly done by the central government
 is prakaar prashasan ke kshetra nepolian ne in adhikariyon par paryaapt niyantran rakh prashasan ko chust-durust banaae rakhaa saath hi yogyata ke aadhaar par inaki niyukti kii
 Napoleon's reforms in administrative areas were in a way anti-revolution because the National Assembly had completely decentralized the administrative structure during the revolution and elected representatives were given the responsibility to govern the country, but the Nepalese gave this arrangement Reversed and reestablished pre-revolution system
 us drushti se vah kranti kaa hantaa tha
 Napoleon tried to revive France from its dismal economic situation

 The task of collecting tax was done by the central employees and the recovery started strictly

 It also set up a separate fund to repay the national debt
 nepolian ne jahaan tak sambhav hua sena ke kharch kaa boj vijit pradeshon par daalaa or france kii janata ko is boj se mukt rakhane kii koshish kii

 Arranged for mechanical education for the progress of various types of businesses, roads, canals built
 francisi audyogic vastuon ko lokapriy banane ke liye pradarshnee ke aayojan ko badhaava diya or swadeshi vastuon evam udyogon ko protsaahan diya
 Encouraged construction work to overcome the problem of unemployment
 is tarah nepolian ne france ko jarjar or diwaaliyepan kii sthit se ubaara
 But even in terms of economic reforms, Napoleon's actions appear to be anti-revolution
 krantikaal main pratyaksh karo par bal diya gaya tha jabaki nepolian ne apratyaksh karon par bal dekar puraatan vyavastha ko sthapit karne kii koshish kii
 In the same way, Napoleon displayed an anti-revolutionary mindset by prioritizing the commercialist philosophy
 uskaa maananaa tha ki rajya ko kosh kii suraksha evam vyapaar main santulan laane ke liye sakriy hastkshep karnaa hoga jabaki kranti kaa bal to mukt vyapaar par tha
 The Nepalese wanted citizens who had faith in him and his system
 iske liye usne shiksha ke rashtriya evam dharmanirpeksh swaroop apanaate hue sudhaar kiye
 Organized education at primary, secondary and higher levels
 sarkaar ke dwaara niyukt shikshakon kii sahaayta se chalane vaale in skulon main ek hi paathyakram, ek hi pathyapustaken ek hi vardi rakhi jaati thi
 Napoleon established a university in Paris and taught subjects in Latin, French, science, mathematics, etc
 yah uniwarsity vishvavidhyalay ke saamaanya arth main koi uniwarsity nahin thi varan praathmik se ucchtar shiksha tak kii sabhi sansthaaon ko ekasutra main baandhne vaali ek vyavastha kii
 Its aim was to keep maximum government control over education and to make students loyal to the government
 nepolian ne shodh kaaryon ke liye insticute of france kii sthapana kii
 Napoleon showed no interest in women's education
 unki shiksha kaa bhaar dharmik sansthaaon par chhod diya gaya
 The majority of France's population was under the influence of the Catholic Church
 kranti ke dauraan carch kii shakti ko kamjor kar use rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya
 Church property was nationalized and clergy were asked to take an oath of loyalty to the state
 isse pope naaraaz hua or aam janata ko virodh karne ke liye uksaaya
 As a result, there was tension between the government and the public
 nepolian ne ise dur karne ke liye 1801 se pope ke saath samjhauta kiya jise konkardet kaha jaataa he
 He had the following provisions
 nepolian kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn or sthaayee kaary tha- vidhi samhita kaa nirmaan
 In fact, before the revolution, the law and order of France was different and there were so many types of laws that even those who followed the law did not know them and this chaos increased even during the revolution
 nepolian ne is avyavashtha ko dur kiya
 Napoleon himself considered his Code of Law more powerful than his 40 wars
 is code ke dwaara nepolian ne france main sarvlokik kanoon paddati kii sthapana kii
 Under the Civil Code, he strengthened the authority of the head of the family
 striyaan purushon ke adheen rakhi gai or pati kaa kaary patni kii raksha karnaa he
 The divorce method was made difficult
 civil vivaah kii vyavastha bhi is samhita main kii gai
 Thus, by recognizing the practice of civil marriage and divorce, Napoleon practiced in Europe that the work of society could go on without the cooperation of the priests
 is prakaar anya samhitaayein jaise vyapaar sambandhi kanoon samhita, Code of Criminal Proc
 aadi banaae gaye
 The interests of the laborers were ignored in its trading code and the ban on their unions continued
 is drushti se nepolian ne kranti ke aadarshon ke viruddh kaary kiya
 Despite this, the importance of this law code was to provide uniformity of law throughout the country and to simplify the judicial system practically
 jahaan-jahaan nepolian kii senaayen gai yah samhita lagu kii gai or nepolian ke paraajay ke baad bhi barkaraar rahi
 It is a permanent fame of Napoleon
 nepolian ke vidhi samhita main burjua varg ke hiton par zyada jor diya gaya he
 The officer related to land was further strengthened and the protection of personal property was further strengthened and a number of laws were enacted to protect personal property
 tered union bananaa aparaadh ghoshit kiya gaya
 In case of litigation, the owners were asked to accept the claims of the owners in lieu of the arguments of the workers
 naagarik samhita kaa aadhaar saamaajik samta bhi he
 Privilege and feudal rule had no place in the Code
 bade putr ko sampatti kaa uttaradhikari maanane kaa kanoon bhi nahin tha sampatti par sabhi putron ko barabari kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Napoleon established a new elite in society
 usne aay ke hisaab se oopaadhiyon kaa kram nirdhaarit kiya
 This work of Napoleon was contrary to the ideals of revolution
 europe raajnneetik kshitij par nepolian kaa pradurbhaav ek ghumaketu kii tarah hua or apni prakriya tathaa parishram ke bal par vah sheeghra hi europe kaa bhaagyavidhaataa ban baitha
 In it, everyone was amazed by his amazing military and administrative abilities
 parantu uski shakti kaa stambh jaise baalu kii bhit par khadaa tha
 What collapsed within a few years was virtually the rise and fall of Napoleon like a dazzling meteor
 vah europe ke akaash main sainik safalataa ke bal par chamakta rahaa parantu paraajay ke saath hi uske bhagya kaa sitara dub gaya
 The empire, which was established after hard work, came to an end on seeing that there were many reasons for its downfall, which are the same
 aseem mahatvakanksha- Napoleon was infinitely ambitious
 aseem mahatvakankshi kisi vyakti ke patan kaa mukhya kaaran sabit hoti he
 The same thing happened with Napoleon
 yuddh main jaise- jaise- uski vijay hoti gai vaise- vaise uski mahatvakanksha badhaata gaya or vah vishwa rajya kii sthapana kaa swapan dekhne laga
 He would not have to see the plight of the downfall if he was satisfied with a little and took care of the conquered empire and spent his time in it
 charitrik durbalata- Napoleon was full of courage, restraint and patience, but in his eyes, hatred was his vengeance and his stigma of forgiveness
 uske charitra kii badi durbalata yah thi ki vah sandhi ko sammanit samjhauta nahin maanata tha
 Friendship of any country was no more than a political necessity for him
 dhire- dhire vah ziddee banataa gaya use yah vishwaas tha ki uskaa prayek kadam thik he
 He could never forget, he began to ignore the advice of others
 falat: uske sachche mitra bhi usase dur hote chale gaye
 Napoleon's system was based on militarism- uski raajnneetik pranali sanyavad par aadhaarit thi jo iske patan kaa pradhan kaaran sabit hua
 He depended on the army in all matters, as a result he was always involved in war
 vah yah bhul gaya ki sainikwaad sirf sankat ke samay hi laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 As long as France was clouded by plagues, the people there supported him
 As soon as the plagues were removed, the people stopped supporting him
 francisi janata kii sahanubhuti or prem kaa khona uske liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Apart from this, the defeated nations became his enemies, who rose up against him as soon as the opportunity arose
 itihaaskaar kabbon ne thik hi likhaa he
 'napoleon's empire flourished in war The war was the basis of his existence and it ended in war itself
 ’ Defective military system prarambh main france kii sena desh prem kii bhaavana se otprot thi
 He used to fight for an ideal and to serve a purpose
 parantu jyon- jyon uske samrajya kaa vistaar hua sena kaa rashtriya rup vidhitat hota gaya
 At first, French troops were included in his army but later German German Purtagali and Dutch soldiers were added to it
 falat: uski sena anek rajyon kii sena ban gai
 There was no ideal and purpose before him
 at: uski sainik shakti kamjor padati gai or yah uske patan kaa mahatvapurn kaaran sabit hua
 Weakness of the Navy nepolian ne sthal sena kaa sanghathan thik se kiya tha kintu uske paas shaktishali nausena kaa abhaav tha, jiske kaaran use england se parajeet hona padaa
 If he had a powerful navy he would not have to be defeated by England
 vijit pradeshon main deshbhakti kaa abhaav- The territories he conquered were not in the hearts of the people, but he had goodwill and love for them
 ve nepolian kii shashan se ghrinaa karte the
 When his power began to weaken, his subordinate states began to strive for their independence
 europea raashtra ne uske khilaaf sangh ke liye chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or isi ke chalate waterlu ke yuddh main use parajeet hona padaa
 Enmity with the pope mahadwipiya vyavastha ke kaaran usne pope ko apana shatru bana liya
 When the Pope refused to accept the same continental system, he took over Rome in April 1808
 or 1809 i
 main pope ko bandi bana liya falat: catholicon ko yah vishwaas ho gaya ki nepolian ne keval rajyon kii swatantraaa nasht karne vaala daanav he
 Otherwise, they also destroy their religion
 audyogic kranti- It is said that he was defeated not in the grounds of Waterloo but in the factories of Manchester and the iron cladding of Barkingdhan
 audyogic kranti ke falswarup england main bade -2 kaarkaane khole gaye or dekhte hi dekhte england samrudh ban gaya
 As a result, he was able to meet his army's modern assassin, which proved fatal to Napoleon
 mahadwipiya vyavastha- The continental system was quite forgotten
 vah england ko sabase bada shatru maanata tha
 England's mainstay of power was naval and worldwide trade and Napoleon could not destroy his naval power, so his trade was tried to strike
 isi uddeshy se usne mahadwipiya vyavastha ko janm diya usne aadesh jari kiya ki koi desh england ke saath vyapaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And neither can use England made
 yah nepolian kii bhayankar bhul thi
 This arrangement trapped him in a trap that was difficult to get out of
