 ise praayah civil ejiniyari ke andar ek visheshgyata kaa kshetra samajha jaataa he
 The job of a structure engineer is often to design buildings and large non-building structures, but they can also be associated with the design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles, etc
 sanrachana ejiniyari kaa siddhanth bhautik niyamon tathaa vibhinn padaarthon / jyamitiyon ke gundharm se sambandhit anubhavjanya gyaan par aadhaarit he
 Complex structures are created by the addition of many small structural components
 sanrachana ejeeniyar ko lohe or ispaat kaa hi nahin, balki lakdi, eent, pathar, chuunaa or cement kaa bhi aadhuniktam gyaan tathaa yantric evam vidyut ejiniyari ke kaamon main bhi daksh hona chahie, kyonki inhen apane dhaanche yantriki tathaa bhautikee ke siddhanton ke anusaar niraapad dhang se banane padate hai
 Full knowledge of the nature of land, water and air should be the same as that of a civil engineer
 sanrachana ejiniyari 19veen shatabdi tak civil ejiniyari kaa ek vibhaag samajha jaataa tha, parantu jaise-jaise sabhy samaaj kii aavashyaktaayen paristhitiyon ke anusaar badalati or badhati gai, unnat prakaar ke lohe, ispaat aadi kaa utpaadan tathaa prayog badhane laga, vaise-vaise yantra-vigyaan kii unnati hui
 Knowledge of the physical properties of various metals increased, so steel was used more and more in the construction of factories and houses
 sthaan kii kami se ispaat ke dhaanchon kii sahaayta se anek manjilon ke makaan banane lage or thodi jagah main anek kamare banane kii vyavastha kaa shubharambh hua
 Today, building twenty-two storey houses in big cities has become a minor thing
 sanrachana ejiniyari ke sahare hi aisa ho sakaa he
 There is also great help from structure engineers in manufacturing
 scotland kii forth nadi ke prasiddh pul main, jo cantelivernuma bana he, nadi ke bich main teen khambhon ke aadhaar par do mehrav to puure bane hai, jinke prayek khambhe kaa paat 1,710 foot he or samast pul kaa paat, tat se tat tak, 5215 foot he
 America's Quebec Bridge is considered the largest of the cantilever bridges around the world
 iske kendriya mehrab kaa paat 1,800 foot he
 The construction of this bridge was finished in 1918 AD, it was started for traffic
 yah pul aadhunik sanrachana kala kaa sarvshereshth namoona he
 The bridge called Hellgate of New York has only one arch
 iske paat kaa vistaar 1,017 foot he
 Among the bridges in India, the Howrah bridge in Calcutta and the Lakshman Jhula in Rishikesh near Haridwar are good examples of this art
 prayek imaarat kii banaavat main chat or farsh ke liye dharanon, kainchiyon, khambhon tathaa jameen par bani buniyaad kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Their combination is the 'structure' of the house
 dhaanche chaahe kisi imaarat, pul athwa kraine aadi yantron ke liye hon, unki rachana karte samay yah vichaar karnaa aavashyak he ki unke vividh avyavon par kis kis prakaar ke tathaa kis pariman main bahari bal bhaar ke rup main padenge
 According to the theory of statics, due to those forces, the stresses on the various components of the structure also have to be calculated very carefully, so that the structure becomes strong and secure in all respects
 dhaanche ko drudh banane kaa arth uske avyavon ko khub motaa tathaa baari bana dena nahin hota
 The structure of the structure should have the ability to bear the force
 aisa dhaanchaa anke tribhujon ko milakar banaaya jaataa he
 Structures made of quadrilaterals and panchmen do not have this much capability
 trikonyukt dhaanche ko kanchi kehete hai
 It is completely innocent from the point of view of the forces to be tolerated and is self-fulfilling from the point of view of the elements
 aisi kainchiyan kaaphi lambey paaton ke liye banaai ja sakati hai tathaa bhaar padane par swayan santulit bhi rah sakati hai
 Why not work by placing simple concrete type long girder on the walls to make big roof roofs? Why triangular scissors are made? The roofs of moderately small roofs can be made by placing a plain girder of the proper size, but the girder is very heavy and expensive if it is too long
 bade paaton ke liye trikonyukt kainchiyan kaaphi majboot hone ke saath hi bahut halaki or sasti padati hai
 The joints of the scissors are made firm by the ribs not by making pins
 ribaton main kuch vishesh prakaar ke bal adhik aane lagate hai jinhen sahane ke liye in ribaton ko adhik majboot avashya hi banaaya jaataa he
 The weight of the entire roof drop is divided through the lights, coming on the upper joints of the triangles, dividing them evenly on all the scissors, and dividing them halfway in half with the weight of these scissors, and finally falls to the base
 at: in bojhon kaa anumaan badi saavdhaanee se kar lenaa hota he
 These burdens always remain the same because they are called immovable loads
 sabhi urdhwadhar deevaaron tathaa dhaalu chhaton par bagal se chalanevaali hawa ke kaaran jo urdhwadhar daab padati he, vah vaayu daab kehalaati he or yah chal bhaar kii ginati main aati he
 The interiors of many storied houses carry the weight of the residents and lift furniture but it is negligible compared to other fixed loads
 dhaanchon ke vibhinn avyavon par padanevaale balon kaa pariklan bal tribhuj athwa bal bahubhujon ke siddhant ke anusaar kiya jaataa he
 Engineers use the "bau signal" system for this
 yah reeti apekshaya saral he
 The forces can also be calculated by pure mathematics with the help of statics and trigonometry
 is prakaar se gananaa karne ke liye, kisi upyukt bindu ko dhurnakendre maanate hue, dhaanche ke kisi avyav main padanevaale agyaat bal ke ghurna se samikrut kar dete hai
 The more the number of small triangles are made in it, the greater the scissors of the roof of the roof or the girder of the bridge are anatomized
 yadi kisi lambey khambhe par bhaar daalaa jaae, to ek seemaa se aage chalakar vah khambha bich main se jhukne lagata he
 The same thing is made of small size triangles of appropriate size to withstand force
 yadi kisi lambey khambhe par bhaar daalaa jaae, to ek seemaa se aage chalakar vah khambha bich main se jhukne lagata he
 The same applies to the pauses of scissors
 at: kainchiyon ko bal sahan karne yogya uchit aakaar ke chote chote trikonon main vibhajit kar banaate hai
 The burden that is placed on the structure is called weight
 chal or achal bhaar kaa ullekh upar hua he
 If the weight is concentrated at some place, it is called the concentrated weight and if it is spread over the entire component, it is called divided weight
 railgadee, motor, trek aadi chalane vaale vaahanon ke bhaar ko charbhaar or ek baar ek disha main or turant baad duusari disha se aanevaale bhaar ko prayavarti bhaar or dhamaake ke saath aanevaale bhaar ko sanghaat bhaar kehete hai
 Materials also have a stress
 bhaar kii paristhiti ore pravriti ke kaaran tanan, sampeden, aparupan, anthan aadi pratibal ho saktaa he
 The change that results from the effect of stress is called distortion
 padaarthon main pratyasthata kaa gun hota he, kisi main kam or kisi main kam or kisi main adhik
 There is a limit of elasticity
 seemaa se adhik bal padane par padaarth tut jate hai
 Hooke established a rule in 1676 that if a force was applied to each substance within its range of elasticity, there would be a special ratio between the stress caused by it and the deformation that occurred in that substance
 san 1826 main doctor yang ne pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar padanevaale pratibalon ke kaaran vibhinn padaarthon main honevaali vikrutiyon ke anupaaton kaa nishchayatmak rup se pataa lagaaya
 This is called Young's elasticity modulus
 tanan evam sampeden sambandhi anupaaton ko E, aparupan sambandhi anupaaton ko C, yaa g akshar or aaytan sambandhi anupaaton ko k akshar dwaara vyakt kiya jaataa he: Direct elasticity modulus anuprastha pratyasthata mapank The volume of substances is reduced by compression
 at: aaytani pratyasthata mapank Changes in elasticity parameters lead to aplomb and mechanization
 yadi kisi thos chad ko khinchaa jaae, to ham dekhte hai ki vah bich main se patali padakar tut jaati he or yadi pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar bal lagaakar khinchaa jaae to uski lambaai badhane ke saath hi sab jagahon se uski parshvik naap choti ho jaati he
 Similarly, if a rod is pressed, its lateral measurement increases
 at: khinchaav athwa dabaav ke kaaran kisi pratyaksh thos kii parshvik naapon main jo parivartan hota he, vah pason ke anupaat ke anusaar hota he
 Express it with the letter M
 vishuddh aparupak pratibal, do saamaan tathaa ek duusare kii virdohi disha main kaam karanevaale pratibalon ke mishran ke rup main hota he
 Their action lines are also at right angles to each other
 yadi dhure kaa ek chor diwaar main dridhtaa se ksaa hua he or uske duusare chor par anthan bal lagaaya jaataa he, to doosraa chor kuch mud jayega
 The angle, which he turns by making the angle from the radish line, will be his convulsive angle
 is kone kii sahaayta se dhure kaa anthan bal nikaala ja saktaa he
 Testing of materials used in engineering is essential
 jis paristhiti main samagriyon kaa upyog hota he usee paristhiti main unako rakhkar, unka pareekshan karnaa chahie
 The test takes place in two ways: one has knowledge of the molecular organization of materials and is seen physically by pulling, pressing, shearing, punching, bending and turning to see how they are able to bear
 bhautik reeti se samagriyon kaa pareekshan karne ke liye aajkal ek yantra bana he jise hounfield tensometer kehete hai
 Its methodology is very simple and even a normal person can use it with a little training
 isse samagriyon kii samathrya, bhaar vikruti, abhishranti ityadi kaa gyaan saralata se ho jaataa he
 Deformation is very subtle or temporary as long as the stress on a substance remains within the range of elasticity of that substance
 bhaar hatate hi vah padaarth apni mul avasthaa main aa jaataa he
 But if the stress is above the threshold of elasticity, then the deformation is substantial and more permanent
 vibhanjak bhaar pratyasthata kii seemaa se kaaphi adhik hota he, par vyapaarik or upyogita kii drushti se yah bhaar kam hi rakhaa jaataa he or ise paraabhav bindu kehete hai tathaa ise hi vibhanjak bhaar maan liya jaataa he
 The limit of elasticity is planned at the time of design, weighting of much less than the bearable load
 at: yah vyaavhaarik bhaar atyadhik sahane yogya bhaar se jis anupaat main kam ho, us anupaat ko us padaarth kaa abhaya gunank yaa abhayank kehete hai
 It is expressed by the following formula: bhinn bhinn padaarthon ke abhayank vibhinn avasthaaon main vibhinn hote hai
 Hard steel is characterized by three in static load and five to eight in movable load and nine to 13 in alternating moving load
 padaarthon kii kathorta se unke tanaav, sampeden, avarupan aadi balon kaa anumaan saralata se lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Modern methods of hardness testing are based on the principles of static dentistry and dynamic dentistry
 sthitik danturata siddhant par aadhaarit hai
 Are based on static dentistry theory
 sthitik danturata siddhant par aadhaarit brinelle kii kathorta-pareekshan-vidhi he, jiske anusaar parikshya padaarth ke ek bhaag par kaanch ke samaan badhiya polish kar usapar bahut kathor ispaat kii, maanak vyas kii, ek goli ko rakhkar yantron dwaara maanak bhaar se dabaate hai
 This causes round marks on the polished surface
 nishaan kaa vyas naapakar nimna sutara ke anusaar goli kaa kathortank nikaalte hai : If the diameter of the bullet is d and the diameter of the mark is d mm
 If it were jo crigra
 prati varg mimi
 main likhaa jaataa he
 The diameter of the bullet is usually 10 mm
 And 3,000 kg for iron and steel, 1,000 kg for soft metals like brass etc
 And 50 kg for very soft metal materials like sis etc
 Standard weights are kept
 saadharantaya bhaar itnaa hi rakhaa jaataa he jisase nishaan kaa vyas goli ke vyas ke 3 / 8 se adhik na ho
 The test can be done with a bullet of any diameter, but the ratio of pressure and diameter of the bullet, p / , should remain the same
 saamaanya kathorta ke liye ispaat kii goli or unchi kathorta ke liye heere kii goli prayukt hoti he
 Weight is given for 15 seconds on hard materials and 30 seconds on soft materials
 nishaan ko sookshmata se maapne kii vyavastha rahati he
 Hardness is also derived from the Vickers method
 isamen goli ke sthaan main chaukor pyramid kii akruti kii hirakani kaa prayog hota he
 This creates a square crater, whose diagonal and depth can be measured more accurately
 isse kathortank is prakaar nikaala jaataa he: Numerous instruments based on dynamic dentistry have been made, of which Scalp made of noise is the most famous
 isamen ispaat kii belanaakaar hathaudi rahati he, jiskaa bhaar lagbhag 40 grain hota
 The hammer below the hammer has a convex hirakni, whose end area is about 0
01 to 0
25 square inch, whose end area is dropped from about 0
01 to 0
025 square inch, then it collides with the test material Leaps up
 nalee ke sahare se lage paimaane ke dwaara hathaudi kii oochaal ko naapakar, padaarth kii kathorta kaa pariklan kiya jaataa he
 The scale carries 140 marks
 kaanch kii uthaal 130, chid kii lakdi kii oochaal 40 or rabar kii oochaal 23 lagbhag hoti he
 The hardness obtained by this device multiplied by six is known as Brinell's hardness and by multiplying it by 6 or 0
22 and 1
32, the approximate peak strength of the substance, in tons per square inch, can be found
 isi prakaar upyukt sthiraankon se guna kar vibhinn padaarthon kii sampeden tathaa aparupak samathrya bhi maaloom ho sakati he
 Various types of forces are seen in the works of structural engineering
 inhen nimnlikhit chah pramukh virgon main baanta ja saktaa he: Various components are added by rebats, or by bolts
 ribaton dwaara bane jod sthaayee hote hai or katkar hi alag alag kiye ja sakate hai, par bolton dwaara jode gaye jod asthaayee hote hai or vibhinn upkhandon main kholkar alag alag kiye ja sakate hai
 All types of components in the structure work are made of rods and plates with various passages of soft steel
 chhadon ke pariched gol, chapate, ytaakar, el, tii athwa ech aadi ke aakaar ke hote hai
 When constructing large scissors in the factory itself, all their components are made by cutting different pieces according to the map and some smaller subdivisions are placed in the factory itself on the flat land and are put in place by the rebates in place; Then by lifting those connected subdivisions by means of cranes etc
, they sit in place and tighten them with bolts
 taanon or thaamon ke avyavon par kitna pratibal padataa he or isamen unke sahane yogya, prati varg inch niraapad pratibal se bhaag dekar, unka pariched ganit dwaara gyaat kar liya jaataa he or usee ke aadhaar par unka nirmaan hota he
 Dharnas and girders occupy a very important place in structured structures, because on them static, variable and movable loads of flat roofs, bridges, gantries, and overhanging paths etc
 are carried
 jab kisi sidhe avyav ke donon siron ko kisi majboot aadhaar par tikaakar, usapar bhaar ladaa jaataa he, tab vah dharan yaa garder kehalaata he
 By placing the burden on the handle, it can be stretched in the middle and if the burden on it is more than its strength, then its lower surface starts to burst

 Dr
 Annie Besant was a woman of a naturalistic nature
 unke raajnneetik vichaar kii aadharshila thi unke aadhyatmik evam naitik mulya
 His idea was that the path of goodness cannot be determined without spirituality
 kalyankari jivan praapt karne ke liye manushya kii ichchhaaon ko daivi ichha ke adheen hona chaiye
 Nation building and development is possible only when unity is established in various religions, beliefs and cultures of that country

 islam kaa udai saatvin sadi main arab prayadweep main hua
 The last prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam was born in Mecca in 570 AD
 lagbhag 613 isvi ke aasapaas mohammad sahab ne logon ko apane gyaan kaa upadesha dena aarambh kiya tha
 This incident leads to the beginning of Islam
 haalaanki is samay tak isko ek nae dharm ke rup main nahin dekha gaya tha
 In later years, Islam was considered a religious sect only due to opposition from the people of Mecca and the departure of Muhammad from Medina
 agle kuch varshon main kai prabud log mohammad s0 ke anuyaayi bane
 Many people became Muslims under the influence of their followers
 iske baad mohammad sahab ne makka vaapasi kii or bina yuddh kiye makkah fatah kiya or makka ke saare virodhiyon ko maaf kar diya gaya
 After this pardon incident, all the people of Mecca converted to Islam
 par payambar ko kai virodhon or nakaaratmak paristhitiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa par unhone har nakaaratmakataa se sakaaraatmakataa ko nichod liya jiske kaaran unhone jivan ke har kshetra main jeet hasil kii
 The empire and spirit of the Arabs continued to grow after their disasters
 arabon ne pehle misr or uttari africa par vijay hasil kii or phir bagentin tathaa farsi samrajyon ko haraaya
 He did not get much success in Europe, but after some struggle in Persia, he started winning
 iske baad purab kii disha main unka samrajya failtaa gaya
 By 1200 they reached India
 
 Hazrat Muhammad Sahab was born in 570 AD in "mecca"
 aapke parivaar kaa makka ke ek bade dharmik sthal par prabhutv tha
 Arab, Christianity, and many groups that were idolaters in the form of tribes at that time
 makka main kaabe main is samay log saal ke ek din jamaa hote the or samuhik pujan hota tha
 You started working for a widow businessman named Khadija
 baad main 25 varsh kii umr main unheen se shaadi bhi kar lee
 In 613, you started telling people that they had received a message from God that God is one and he asked humans to walk on the path of truth and honesty
 unhone murtipuja kaa bhi virodh kiya
 But the people of Mecca did not like this thing
 mohammad sahab ko san 622 main makka chhodkar janaa padaa
 Muslims call this event a Hijra and from here the Islamic calendar Hijri begins
 agle kuch dinon main madina main unke kai anuyaayi bane tab unhone makka vaapasi kii or makka ke shaskaon ko yuddh main haraa diya
 After this many people became his followers and called their supporters as Muslims, during this time they had to fight many protests and battles
 sabase pehle to apane hi kul ke chachere bhaiyon ke saath badr kii ladaai hui - jisamen 313 logon kii sena ne kareeb 900 logon ke akraman ko parrast kiya
 After this, many parts of the Arabian Peninsula went to war with the opponents
 us samay makka tathaa madina main yahudee va kuch isai bhi rahete the
 But at that time, they were considered supporters of the unity of God, not seeing a different religion
 hazrat mohammad makkah waapas huve
 People felt that there would be a big war, but there was no war, the people lived peacefully, and Muhammad Sahab and his followers entered Makkah
 is tarah makkah bina kisi yuddh ke swadhin hogaya
 Muhammad Sahab's return to Mecca was an important event in the history of Islam, from which it later became a religion rather than being a sect
 san 632 main aapaki vafaat ho gayi
 By that time, the entire Arabian peninsula was tied to the thread of Islam
 san 632 main jab paigambar mohammad kii mrityu hui muslimon ke khandit hone kaa bhay utpann ho gaya
 No person was the legitimate successor of Islam
 yahi uttaradhikari itane bade samrajya kaa bhi swami hota
 Earlier, the Arabs had fought as fighters in the Bazantine or Persian armies, but had never become the owners of such a large empire
 isi samay kilaafat kii sanstha kaa gathan hua jo is baat kaa nirnay karata ki islam kaa uttaradhikari koun he
 Muhammad Bakr's friend Abu Bakr was declared the successor of Muhammad
 chauthe caliph ali mohammad sahab ke farik the or unhone mohammad sahab kii beti fatima se shaadi kii thi
 Despite this, at the time of his Khilafat, the Khilafat was challenged by the supporters of the third Khalifa Osman and civil war broke out in the Arab Empire
 san 961 main ali kii hatya kar di gai or osman ke ek nikat ke rishtedaar muavia ne apane aap ko khalipha ghoshit kar diya
 Umeyyad dynasty started from this time
 iskaa naam us parivaar par padaa jisane makka ke islam ke samaksh samarpan se pehle muhammd sahab ke saath ladaai main pramukh bhoomika nibhaai thi
 The Arab Empire soon took the form of the Bazantine Empire and the Sasani Empire
 khilaafat pita se bete ko hastantarit hone lagi
 Damascus was the capital
 umayadon ne arabon ko samrajya main bahut hi tarzih di par arabon ne hi unki aalochana kii
 The Arabs said that the Ummaydas have made Islam very mundane and that things at the root of Islam are becoming less common
 in muslimon ne milakar ali ko islam kaa sahi khalipha samajha
 He felt that Ali could have been the de facto heir of Islam
 san 940 main ek abu muslim naam ke ek farsi muslim parivartit ne umayyadon ke khilaaf ek vishaal janamanas taiyaar kiya
 He revolted against the Umayyads in Khorasan
 khorasaan main pehle se hi arabon kii upasthiti ke khilaaf naaraazgi thi atah usko bade paimaane par jan samarthan mila
 He cautioned the people against the Ummidas by saying that they are not the rightful heirs of Islam and they are misusing power
 umayyadon kaa vilasita purna jivan-style ne inako or bhi bhadakaayaa
 Between 949–950, he defeated the troops sent by the Umayyads and then declared a new caliph - Abul Abbas
 abbaas, muhammd ke vansh se hi tha par ali ke alaave ek duusare bhai ke dwaara mohammad sahab se judaa tha
 But the popularity of Abu Islam was not seen by him and he hanged Abu
 isse logon main abbaas ke khilaaf rosh fail gaya
 Those who did not even trust Abbas became Shia - 92% of Iran's population today is Shia
 haalanki abbaas or uske vanshajon ne baghdad main apni rajdhani banaakar agle lagbhag 500 saalon tak raaj kiya
 Iranians also received participation in the empire during the Abbasid period
 haalanki ve kisi dharmik ohade par nahin rahe par sthapaty tathaa kavita jaisi kalaon main achche hone kii vajah se iraniyon ko shashan kaa sahyog mila
 Keep in mind that many medieval Islamic thinkers, astrologers and poets were born at this time
 umr khayyam ne jyotish vidya main purvi iran main ek adwitiya oonchaai chhui - ek nae panchang kaa avishkaar kiya
 He mastered the Rubai style of poems and made many yoga contributions to science - including algebra and mineralogy
 firdausi jaise farsi kavi or rumi jaise sufi vichaarak isi samay paija hue the
 Although most of them did not receive any economic stance from Baghdad, the non-interference of the theologians of Islam was a major contribution in this
 is samay nihsandeh rup se puure islamic samrajya ko, jo spain se bharat tak failaa tha, ek sainik nayak ke andar rakhana mushkil tha
 Therefore, Baghdad remained the only religious headquarters and the local rulers remained militarily independent
 purvi iran main jahaan samaani or uske baad gazanvi swatantra rahe vahiin madhya tathaa pashchim main saljuk turk shaktishaalee ho gaye
 Even during the crusades, Baghdad failed to take any major success
 vahiin satta se baahar sahe umayyadon ke vanshajon ne spain main san 929 main apni ek alag kilaafat bana lee jo baghdad kaa islamic pratidwandi ban gaya
 In 1258 the rapidly growing power of the Mongols defeated Baghdad and the city was looted
 lakhon log maare gaye or islamic pustakaalayon ko jala diya gaya
 The Mongols were not Muslim at the time, but they became Muslims in the next 100 years
 baghdad main abbasiyon kii satta terahavin sadi tak rahi
 But Iran and its surrounding areas had a great reverence for Abu Islam and a rage against the Abbasids
 unki najar main abu islam kaa sachcha pujari tha or ali tathaa hossain islam ke sachche uttadhikari
 Those believing this belief were called Shia
 ali shiya kaa arth hota he ali kii toli vaale
 In the eyes of these people, these people took the path of truth and they were persecuted a lot by the rulers
 abu islam ko islam ke liye sahi khalipha ko khojkar bhi phaansi kii takhti ko gale lagaana padaa
 The same thing happened to him with Ali or Imam Hussain
 atah is vichaar vaale shiya kai saalon tak abbasid shashan main rahe jo sunni the
 They were also tortured from time to time

 Consonants: The following consonants can be typed with the help of the Hindi-traditional keyboard
 hindi - paramparaagat kunjeepatal le outvyanjanon ke aadhe akshar: “matraaon ke neeche diya gaya bindu vaala chakra, bina spes vaale un varnon ko darshata he, jinhen vaid rup main tankit varna banane ke liye kisi anya mul varna ke saath sanyojit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Half the letters of the key consonant letters of Devanagari can also be typed
 jab aadhe akshar tip kiye jate hai to usamen anternihit swar nahin rahata or saamanyat: ise bina maatra ke pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 For example, there is an underlying vowel / a / in the letter a
 iskaa aadha akshar isprakaar k dikhaai padega
 vyanjan: nimnlikhit swaron ko hindi-paramparaagat yaa marathi kunjeepatal kii sahaayta se tip kiya ja saktaa he
 There are two types of vowels, which can be typed
 swatantra swar: devanagari lipi main kuch akshar aise hai, jo apane pairon par khadey rah sakate hai
 These are independent vowels
 inkaa upyog kisi swar se shuruuaat ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The following independent vowels can be typed from any keyboard supporting the Devanagari text
 a aa i i u uu ri e i ji o ou o tippanee: ji, o or unki matraaon ko angrezi kii dhvaniyon ko prakat karne ke liye haal hi main devanagari lipi main swaron ke rup main sthaan diya gaya he
 Dependent vowels: These are also called quantities
 maatra ke rup main inkaa upyog anternihit swar ko prakat karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Dependent vowels cannot stand on their feet on their own
 Single consonants or conjuncts of consonants may also contain dependent vowels, indicating which type of vowel is in the letter, which is different from the independent vowel
 nimnlikhit ashrith swaron ko devanagari paath ko saport karne vaale kisi bhi kunjeepatal se tip kiya ja saktaa he
 Shri Prasattra's Note: The circle with dots below the quantities represents the characters without spaces, which need to be combined with any other basic characters to make the characters typed as valid
 Is required
 jab unhen avaidh kram main jyon kaa tyon tip kiya jaataa he to ve bindu vaale chakra ke saath darshaae jate hai
 Example: Applying dependent vowels to consonants kuch sthitiyon main jahaan yah abhisht hota he ki swarrahit vyanjanon ko sanyuktakshron se alag rakhaa jaae to halant kaa spasht rup se prayog kiya jaataa he
 This is done using a character called zero width non-joiner just before the vowel consonant preventing the formation of the conjunct

 The Devanagari script has many connective symbols like Anusvara, Chandrabindu and Visarga

 At the Second Congress of CSP in January 1936, this thesis was accepted that there was a need to establish a united Indian Socialist Party on the basis of marxism-leninism
 isi tarah, siespi kii teesri congress ke baad bani rashtriya kaaryakaarani samiti main kai communiston ko shaamil kiya gaya
 However, it did not last long
 1940 main congress ke ramgarh adhiveshan main bhakpa ne 'prolitarian path' sheershak se ek dastauez jari kiya
 In this, citing the weak state of the colonial state due to the war, it spoke of waging an armed movement against it
 bhakpa kii is iktarfa ghoshnaa se naaraaz hokar siespi ne communist sadasyon ko apni party se baahar kar diya
 Meanwhile, the ban was lifted in July 1942 due to the good relations between the Soviet Union and Britain in World War II

 This opposition reached the extent that he supported British rule during the Quit India Movement
 iske peeche ek mukhya kaaran yah bhi tha ki bhakpa kii raajnneeti main bhartiya paristhitiyon ko kam ahmiyat di jaati thi
 On most occasions, communist international or Soviet Union directives worked to determine the party's strategy
 isi kaaran kai baar isaki ranneetiyaan ulti disha main aage badhin
 Despite these disturbances, the workers' organization of the Congress and its position in some parts of the country had become quite strong
 bengal main hue tebhaaga andolan or andhra pradesh main hue telugana andolan main bhi communiston ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 In the Tebhaga Movement in 1946, the Bengal totters struggled to have two-thirds of their agricultural produce

 In some places this movement also turned violent

 There was already a movement against the Nizam of Hyderabad under the banner of Andhra Mahasabha

 They made the farmers aware against the Nizam and the local landlords
 naalgonda, warangal or khammam jilon main kisaanon ne karz maafi, bandhua mazaduri khatm karne or bhoomi punarvitaran ke liye andolan chalaaya
 This movement started in 1945 and by 1946 it gained a lot of vigor
 nizaam kii senaaon or zameendaaron ke lathaiton ne iskaa krurta se daman kiya
 Thousands of peasants were murdered
 lekin kisaanon ke sashastr daston ne jam kar is daman kaa muqabla kiya
 These squads got control of many villages and they implemented land reform policies there
 1948 tak unhone 3,000 gaanvon kii takreeban 16,000 varg mile bhoomi ko mukt kara liya or uskaa gaanv ke logon ke bich vitaran kar diya
 The Nizam's rule came to an end with the intervention of the Indian Army in September 1948

 The Indian Army also violently repressed it

 During the independence of India, there was intense and interesting debate in the CPI about the independence and the nature of the Indian state
 isi kaaran party ne samvidhan sabha main bhi bhaag nahin liya
 When India got independence, P
C
 Joshi was the general secretary of the CPI
 unhone is baat par jor diya ki satta kaa hastantaran vaastavik he or nehru kii sarkaar se yah spasht sanket miltaa he ki vah samrajyavad-virdohi takaton kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 He therefore urged that the CPI should reevaluate its views about the Congress
 lekin party ke bheetar ise paryaapt samarthan nahin mila
 Bt a crème under the leadership of Ranadive argued that mass rebellion was gaining momentum in India
 isliye bhakpa loktantric or samaajawaadee charnon ko mila kar puure raashtra main mazaduron ke sashastr sangharsh dwaara satta par kabza karne kii koshish kar sakati he
 Some within the party compared the Telangana experience to the Mao struggle in China and advocated for a public war against the Indian state
 ise 'andhra line' kaha gaya
 Ranadive Line won in the Calcutta Congress of 1948
 lekin duusari ore bharat main nehru sarkaar dwaara telugana andolan ke sashastr daman kii ijazat dene or duusari ore chini kranti ke safal hone ke kaaran party main 'andhra line' kii sthiti majboot ho gayi
 This led to the leadership of the party by Andhra Pradesh leader C

 joshi ne nehru sarkaar kii deshi-videshi niti kaa vishleshan karte hue yah sabit karne kii koshish kii ki isamen samrajyavad-virdohi pravriti he
 To resolve this internal dispute of the party, some senior party leaders went to Moscow and had a long discussion with the Communist Party leaders there
 iske baad teen dastauez taiyaar hue
 These documents made it clear that India is a dependent and semi-colonial country and the Nehru government was catering to the interests of the landlords, the big monopolistic Burzwa and British imperialism
 bhartiya burjwa kii prakruti spasht karte hue yah kaha gaya ki praathmik rup se samrajyavaadee burjwa par nirbhar hone ke baavjood isamen rashtravaadi or a-sahyogi tatva maujuud hai
 After this, moderate leader Ajay Ghosh took command of the party
 is daur main party ne bharat kii azaadi ko manyata di or samvidhan ko sweekaar karte hue chunaavon main bhaag lene kaa faisalaa kiya gaya
 The party's performance in the first general elections cannot be considered very spectacular, but it emerged as the main opposition party by winning 16 seats in the Lok Sabha
 bhakpa ne khaastaur par sangathit kshetra main kaam karne vaale mazaduron ke bich apni sthiti majboot karne par dhyaan diya
 Its labor organization All India Trade Union Congress was well established among the workers
 lekin us samay desh kii raajnneeti main congress or nehru ke varchasv ko chunauti dena mushkil tha
 Nevertheless, the CPI strengthened its position in some states
 duusare aam chunaavon main phir se congress ko spasht bahumat mila, lekin bhakpa kii siton main bhi badhotaree hui
 It won 27 Lok Sabha constituencies in these elections
 kerala main 1957 ke vidhansabha chunaavon ke baad i
em
es
 namboodiripad ke netritv main bhakpa kii sarkaar bani
 It was the first elected communist government in the world
 lekin 1959 main nehru sarkaar ne ise barkhaast kar diya
 This caused a lot of resentment towards Nehru within a section of the CPI
 lekin is samay bhakpa ke kaaryakarta bhram kii sthiti main the, kyonki nehru sarkaar kaa soviet union ke saath kaafii acha sambandh tha
 The Soviet party expected the CPI to adopt a soft attitude towards the Nehru government
 is bich antarrashtriya str par aisi ghatnaayen ghatin jiske kaaran na sirf antarrashtriya communist ekta prabhavit hui, balki bhakpa kaa bhi vibhaajan ho gaya
 By the sixties, relations between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China began to deteriorate
 china kii communist party ne soviet union kii communist party par aarope lagaaya ki vah sanshodhanavaadee ho kar marxvad-leninavaad ke raste se bhatak chuki he
 Here, relations between China and India also worsened
 seemaa vivaad ke kaaran 1962 main bharat-china ke bich yudgh bhi hua
 a faction of the CPI supported the policy of the Government of India
 vahiin party ke ek duusare dhade ne yah daawa kiya ki yah samaajawaadee or poonjeewaadi rajya ke bich takaraav he
 In fact, the tactics of these factions of the CPI also played an important role in the international trend among communists
 bhakpa ke soviet samarthak dhade ne us samay kii sattadhari party bhartiya rashtriya congress ke saath sahyog karne ke vichaar ko aage badhaayaa
 But another faction of the CPI, which later became the CPI, called it the revisionist idea of 'class-cooperation'
 gauratlab he ki bharat ke tisare aam chunaavon main bhakpa ko 29 siton par jeet mili
 The CPI was still the second largest party in Parliament after the Congress
 lekin party ke ek kheme ke bheetar yah vishwaas prabal ho gaya tha ki asal main nehru sarkaar ke prati zyaada sakht ravaiya na rakhane kaaran hi bhakpa kaa prasar nahin ho rahaa he
 After a time, this conflict increased significantly
 1964 main bhakpa kaa vibhaajan ho gaya or ek nayi party makapa kaa ubhaar hua
 Many militant leaders of the CPI like Namboodiripad, Jyoti Basu, Harkishan Singh Surjeet etc
 joined the CPI (M)
 isse pashchim bengal jaise rajyon main bhakpa ke aadhaar par nakaaratmak prabhaav padaa
 The CPI also had a significant impact for the first few decades of the party's split in Kerala
 1970-77 ke bich bhakpa ne congress se gathjod kiya or uske saath milakar sarkaar bhi banaayi jisamen bhakpa ke si
 achyut menon rajya ke mukhyamantri bane 
 Subsequently, the CPI did not get a chance to come to power in any state
 1970-77 ke daur main congress se gathjod hone ke kaaran bhakpa ne indira gandhi kii congress dwaara lagaaye gayi apatkaal kaa samarthan kiya
 But by the decade of the eighties, the CPI (M) became a stronger Communist Party
 desh ke duusare kai bhaagon main bhakpa kii acchhee upasthiti rahi, lekin kuch kshetron main zyaada majboot upasthiti ke kaaran makapa aage nikal gayi
 After 1977, the CPI formed the Left Front in association with the CPI (M) and other minor communist parties
 vyaavhaarik taur par kerala sahit adhikansh jagahon par yah party makapa ke ek chote sahyogi dal main badal gayi
 On most occasions, its performance depended on the performance of the Left Front
 nabbe ke baad ke daur main bhakpa ne secular or gair-bhaajapa, gair-congress dalon kii raajnneeti ko majbooti dene par kaafii dhyaan diya he
 It opposed the neo-liberal policies of the Congress in association with the CPI-M led Left Front
 1996 ke loksabhaa chunaavon ke baad kisi dal ko bahumat nahin mila
 The BJP government, the largest party, could not prove its majority in the Lok Sabha
 iske baad ech
di
 devegoda ke netritv main sanyukt morche kii sarkaar bani
 The CPI, taking a historic decision, decided to join this government
 yah faisalaa makapa ke faisale se kaafii alag tha jisane jyoti basu ko pradhanmantri banane kaa prastaav thukraa diya tha
 Thus, despite being part of the Left Front, it displayed its political autonomy
 sanyukt morche kii donon sarkaron kii sarkaar main iske netaa shaamil hue or unhone grih mantralay or krishi mantralay jaise mahatvapurn mantralay sambhaale
 After the fall of the United Front government, the NDA government was formed at the center
 is sarkaar ke kaarykaal ke dauraan bhakpa ne vam morche ke ek ghatak ke rup main zimmedaar vipaksh kii bhoomika nibhaai
 The Left Front supported the 2004 United Progressive Alliance government
 isane yah sunishchit karne kii koshish kii yah sarkaar apane nunatam saajha kaarykram ke anusaar hi kaam kare
 During this time, the CPI also pressured the government to adopt several people-oriented programs
 aamtaur prekshak yah maanate rahe hai ki samprag-ek kii sarkaar ke dauraan bane bahut pragatisheel or janonmukhi kanoonon ke peeche vam morche ke dabaav kii mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi
 In 2008, the Left Front withdrew support from the United States to the UPA government over the nuclear deal issue
 2009 ke aam chunaavon main vam morche kaa pradarshan 2004 ke aam chunaavon kii tulana main kaafii karaab rahaa
 The reason for this was the decline in the performance of the Left Front in West Bengal
 khaastaur par singoor or nandigram jaisi jagahon main rajya sarkaar dwaara jabardastee bhoomi adhigrahan kii koshish or uske virodh kaa bal-prayog dwaara daman karne jaisi ghatnaon ne vam morche kii chhavi kaafii karaab kii
 It also had an impact on the cpi's electoral performance and it won only 4 seats in Lok Sabha compared to 10 in 2004
 bhakpa kii raajnneeti kii kai seemayen ab spasht ho chuki hai : pehla, bhakpa ne vam morche kii raajnneeti main khud kaa is tarah samahit kar liya he ki kai gambheer masalon par bhi isane ek seemaa se zyaada makapa kaa virodh nahin kiya he
 It has shown its autonomy only on a few occasions, but on most issues its strategy is part of the strategy of the Left Front
 doosraa, yadhyapi makapa desh ke teen rajyon main kaafii majboot sthiti main he, lekin bhakpa kaa vistaar desh ke duusare bhaagon main zyaada rahaa he
 For example, CPI also has a strong presence in states like Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Tamil Nadu
 lekin bihar jaise rajyon main isane apana aadhaar kaafii had tak kho diya he, kyonki ab pahchaan kii raajnneeti ke saamne vah apni praasangikta sabit karne main naakaam rahi he
 Third, the CPI has failed to expand into new areas like other parliamentary left parties
 yah ek tarah se thahari hui party ban gayi he
 It has either managed to save its base in some places, or is also losing that base
 naye kshetron main bhakpa kaa prasar nahin ho rahaa he
 It won only less than 15 seats in every election of Lok Sabha after 1980

 Fourth, it is also alleged that the CPI has withdrawn from the politics of struggle at the ground level
 yadhyapi is aalochana ko puri tarah se sahi nahin mana ja saktaa, kyonki jin kshetron main bhakpa kaa astitv he, vahaan usne rajya daman ke kilaaf kaafii sangharsh kiya he

 paanchavaan, bhakpa kii raajnneeti kii aalochana kaa ek aadhaar yah bhi rahaa he ki isane poonjeewaadi rajya kii loktantric vyavastha ko puri tarah sweekaar kar liya he
 Now it is working within the nationalist framework and the strategy of overthrowing the capitalist state is not part of its politics
 baharhaal, in aalochanaon ke baavjood is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki bhartiya raajnneeti main bhakpa ke paas ek lambi viraasat he
 Most of the currents of Indian communist politics originated from this party

 It has been trying to strengthen the non-congress, non-bjp politics in India and promote the interests of the common people
 bhrashtachar jaise aaropon se bhakpa har str par puri tarah se mukt rahi he
 In fact, the main challenge of the CPI is that it, despite being part of the Left Front, avoid being a 'photo copy' or small ally of the CPI (M) and maintain its autonomous politics
 iske alaava, desh ke vibhinn bhaagon apana prasar karnaa bhi bhakpa ke liye ek badi chunauti he
