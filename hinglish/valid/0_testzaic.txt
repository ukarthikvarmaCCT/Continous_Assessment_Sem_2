 Charvak philosophy is a materialistic atheist philosophy
 yah maatr pratyaksh pramaan ko maanata he tathaa parloukik sattaaon ko yah siddhant sweekaar nahin karata he
 This philosophy is also called Vedabhya
 vedabaahya darshan chha: hai- charvak, madhyamik, yogachaar, sautrantik, vaibhashik, or arhat
 In all these, there is a rendering of principles unrelated to the Veda
 ajit keshakambali ko charvak ke agradoot ke rup main shrey diya jaataa he, jabaki brihaspati ko aamtaur par charvak yaa lokayat darshan ke sansthaapak ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Most of the primary literature of the Charvaka, Jupiter Sutra, is missing or lost
 isaki shikshaaon ko aitihaasik madhyamik sahitya se sankalit kiya gaya he jaise ki shaastra, sutara, or bhartiya mahakavy kavita main or gautam buddha ke samvaad or jain sahitya se
 Charvak was an atheist and atheist logical of ancient India
 ye naastik mat ke pravartak brihaspati ke shishy maane jate hai
 Nothing is known about when Jupiter and Charvak happened
 brihaspati ko chanakya ne apane arthshaastra granth main arthshaastra kaa ek pradhan acharya mana he
 On hearing the name of Charvak, you will remember 'jeeva jeevat sukham jeevat, loan kritva, ghritam peewat' The name 'charvak' has been changed to abusive abusive language
 maanon is siddhant ko maanane vaale sirf karjkhor, bhogavaadi or patit log the
 The prevailing belief is that the word Charvak originated from 'charu' + 'speech'
 zaahir he ki yah namakaran is siddhant ke un virodhiyon dwaara kiya gaya he ki jinka maananaa tha ki yah log mithi-mithi baton se bhole-bhale logon ko bahakaate the
 The term 'lokayat' is used even in Buddhist Pitas for Charvaka doctrines which means 'the system of philosophy which believes in this folk and does not believe in the concept of heaven, hell or liberation'
 Charvak or Lokayat philosophy is also mentioned in Mahabharata, but no original text is available
 zaahir he ki chunki yah apane samay kii sattadhari takaton ke khilaaf baat karata tha, to iske granthon ko nasht kar diya gaya or prachlit kathaon main charvaakon ko khalnaayakon kii tarah pesh kiya gaya
 Charvak's vote is found in Sarvadarshan Sangraha
 padmapurana main likhaa he ki asuron ko bahakaane ke liye brihaspati ne vedaviruddh mat prakat kiya tha
 In relation to the atheist faith, it is written in Vishnupurana that when the demons became very strong with the power of religion, then the gods called on Vishnu
 vishnu ne apane sharir se mayamoh naamak ek purush utpann kiya jisane narmada tat par digbanr rup main jaakar tap karte hue asuron ko bahakaakar dharmamarg main bhrasht kiya
 What Mayamoh preached to the Asuras is very similar to the verses of the Charvak faith given in the Sarvadarsanasangraha
 jaise, - mayamoh ne kaha he ki yadi yajna main maaraa hua pashu swarg jaataa he to yajmaan apane pita ko kyon nahin maar daalata, ityadi
 In the context of Tripuravinash in Lingpuran, there is also a story of a Digambar Muni, inspired by Shiva, being seduced by asuras in a similar way, which aims at the Jains
 valmiki ramayana ayodhya kandamen maharishi jawali ne ramchandra ko banbaas chhod ayodhya laut jane ke liye jo upadesh diya he vah bhi charvak ke mat se bilkul miltaa he
 All these things prove that atheism is very ancient
 iskaa avirbhaav usee samay main samajhnaa chahie jav vaidic karmkaandon kii adhikta logon ko kuch khatakane lagi thi
 Charvak does not believe in God and the hereafter
 paralok na maanane ke kaaran hi inke darshan ko lokayat bhi kehete hai
 Happiness is the main goal of this life in the Sarvadarshan Sangraha by the opinion of Charvaka
 sansar main dukh bhi he, yah samajhakar jo sukh nahin bhogana chaahate, ve murkh hai
 If the fish has thorns, does it not eat any fish? The foursome will go to the field, fearing that no field should be sown? And so on
 charvak aatma ko pruthak koi padaarth nahin maanate
 According to their opinion, alcohol is produced in alcohol due to the combination of jaggery, tandul etc
 Similarly, consciousness is generated by the combination of these four ghosts like earth, water, light and air
 inke vishleshan yaa vinaash se 'main' arthath chetanta kaa bhi naash ho jaataa he
 There is no return etc
 after the name of this conscious body
 ishwar, paralok aadi vishay anumaan ke aadhaar par hai
 But Charvak does not take the inference into evidence except direct
 unka tark he ki anumaan vyaptigyaan kaa ashrith he
 The name of the knowledge that is passed on to us through the senses is extended to the past and future, which is impossible
 man main yah gyaan pratyaksh hota he, yah koi pramaan nahin kyonki man apane anubhav ke liye indriyon kaa hi ashrith he
 If you say that there is prevalence of knowledge through inference, then the error of error comes, because you want to prove the conjecture only on prevalence
 charvak kaa mat sarvadarshansangrah, sarvadarshanshiromani or brihaspatisutra main dekhnaa chahie
 This opinion is also mentioned in the 17th canto of Naishadh
 charvak keval pratyakshvadita kaa samarthan karata he, vah anumaan aadi pramaanon ko nahin maanata he
 In his opinion, the earth is water fast and air is the only four elements from which everything is made
 uske mat main akaash tatv kii sthiti nahin he, inhi chaaron tatwon ke mail se yah deh bani he, inke vishesh prakaar ke sangyojan maatr se deh main chaitanya utpann ho jaataa he, jisko log aatma kehete he
 When the body is destroyed, Chaitanya also disappears
 is prakaar se jeev in bhuto se utpann hokar inhi bhuto ke ke nasht hote hi samaapt ho jaataa he, aage peeche iskaa koi mahatv nahin he
 Therefore, the body that is seen in the conscious is the form of a soul, there is no evidence to be an additional soul from the body
 charvak ke mat se stri putr or apane kutumbiyon se milane or unke dwaara diye jane vaale sukh hi sukh kehalaate he
 To embrace them is to make effort, to eat and live happily in the world
 is darshan main kaha gaya he, ki:- Meaning that as long as you want to live, you should live happily, if you do not have the means, then you should have fun by borrowing from another, who has seen the body come back after burning of the body in the crematorium? charvak darshan ke anusaar prithvi, jal, tej tathaa vaayu ye chaar hi tatva sristi ke mul kaaran hai
 Just like Buddhist, Charvak also believes that there is no element called Akash
 yah shunya maatr he
 The above four elements are visible in the form of outer world, sense or body when coming from their molecular state to the gross state
 akaash kii vastvatmak satta na maanane ke peeche inaki pramaan vyavastha kaaran he
 Just as we experience their smell, smell, form and touch, we also express their relatives through senses
 akaash tatva kaa vaisaa pratyaksh nahin hota
 Therefore, there is no element called Akash in their opinion
 chaar mahabhuton kaa mulkaaran kya he? is prashn kaa uttar charvaakon ke paas nahin he
 This world is just a collection or collision of four mahabhutas that are found in different forms and in different quantities
 charvaakon ke anusaar chaar mahabhuton se atirikt aatma naamak koi anya padaarth nahin he
 Chaitanya is the quality of the soul
 chunki aatma naamak koi vastu he hi nahin at: chaitanya sharir kaa hi gun yaa dharm siddh hota he
 That is, this body is the soul
 isaki siddhi ke teen prakaar he-tark, anubhav or ayurveda shaastra
 For the attainment of the soul by logic, the Charvak people say that the living remains conscious and the absence of the body does not remain conscious
 is anvay vyatirek se sharir hi chaitanya kaa aadhaar arthath aatma siddh hota he
 Experience 'I am gross', 'I am weak', 'I am fair', 'I am inactive' etc
 We experience on foot
 sthulata durbalata ityadi sharir ke dharm hai or 'main' bhi vahi he
 Therefore, the body is the soul
 ayurveda jis prakaar good, jau, mahua aadi ko mila dene se kaal kram ke anusaar us mishran main madshakt utpann hoti he, athwa dahi pili mitti or gobar ke paraspar mishran se usamen bichchhu paidaa ho jaataa he athwa paan, kattha, supaari or chuunaa main laal rang na rahane par bhi unke mishran se munh main laalimaa utpann ho jaati he usee prakaar chaturbhuton ke vishisht sammishran se chaitanya utpann ho jaataa he
 But what is the reason for mixing of these ghosts in specific amounts? The answer to this question is nothing but Charvak
 ishwar-nyaay aadi shastron main ishwar kii siddhi anumaan yaa aapt vachan se kii jaati he
 Since Charvak considers direct and only direct evidence, the only visible king in his opinion is God, he is the controller of his kingdom and the subjects living in it
 at: use hi ishwar maananaa chaiye
 Theorem means accurate knowledge of the subject, that is, proof is required for prama
 charvak lok keval pratyaksh pramaan maanate hai
 Knowledge arising out of the proximity of subject and senses is called direct knowledge
 hamaari indriyon ke dwaara pratyaksh dikhalaayi padane vaala sansar hi prameya he
 Other than this, other substances are discrete
 aankh, kaan, naak, jihva or twachaa ke dwaara rup shabd gandh ras evam sparsh kaa pratyaksh ham sabko hota he
 There is no need for any other evidence for an object which is not empirical
 buddha, jain naamak avaidic darshan tathaa nyayavaisheshik aadi ardhvaidic darshan anumaan ko bhi pramaan maanate hai
 He says that the power of all theorems cannot be proved by direct evidence
 parantu charvak kaa kathan he ki anumaan se keval sambhaavna paidaa kii ja sakati he
 Cognitive knowledge is direct
 duurastha hare bhare vrikshon ko dekhakar vahaan pakshiyon kaa kolahal sunakar, udhar se aane vaali hawa ke thande jhoke se ham vahaan pani kii sambhaavna maanate hai
 The achievement of water is determined only by going there
 at: sambhaavna utpann karne tathaa lokvyavahaar chalaane ke liye anumaan aavashyak hota he kintu vah pramaan nahin ho saktaa
 The prevalence on the basis of which the presumption is considered the power of proof is nothing but coverage
 dhooma ke saath agni kaa, pushp ke saath gandh kaa hona swabhaav he
 Happiness and sorrow of religion and the working sense of unrighteousness are natural
 jaise kokil ke shabd main madhurata tathaa kauwe ke shabd main karkashta swaabhaavik he usee prakaar sarvatra samajhnaa chaiye
 As far as word proof is concerned, it is a kind of direct proof
 aapt purush ke vachan hamako pratyaksh sunaayi dete hai
 Listening to them makes sense
 yah pratyaksh hi he
 As far as the Vedas are concerned, their sentences describe uninteresting and inauspicious topics, so their credibility is relevant
 saath hi adharm aadi main ashwalingagrahan sadrush lajjaspad evam mansabhakshan sadrush ghrinaaspad kaary karne se tathaa jarbhari turfari aadi arthhin shabdon kaa prayog karne se veda apni apramanikta swayan siddh karte hai
 From the above description it becomes clear that the Charvak people do not accept anything other than this directly visible body and world
 dharm, arth, kaam or moksh naamak purusharthchatushtay ko ve log purush arthath manushya deh ke liye upyogi maanate hai
 In his view, meaning and work are the ultimate effort
 dharm naam kii vastu ko maananaa morrkhtaa he kyonki jab is sansar ke atirikt koi anya swarg aadi he hi nahin to dharm ke fal ko swarg main bhogane kii baat anargal he
 It is not religion to perform the yajna etc
 to enjoy the happiness of heaven conceived by the hypocritical rascals, but it is unrighteous due to animal violence, etc
 It is the misuse of things, and the misuse of things and suffering of the waste body
 He should do the same to bring happiness to the body
 jisamen indriyon kii tripti ho man andith ho vahi kaary karnaa chaiye
 Those who are satisfied with the senses should rejoice and those subjects should be consumed
 sharir indriya man ko anandaplavit karne main jo tatva baadhak hote hai unako dur karnaa, na karnaa, maar dena dharm he
 To endure physical mental distress, to force the mind and body from contentment is wrong
 taatpary yah he ki aastik vaidic evam yahan tak ki ardhvedic darshanon main, puraanon smritiyon main varnit aachaar kaa paalan yadi sharir sukh kaa sadhak he to unka anusaran karnaa chaiye or yadi ve uske baadhak hote hai to unka sarvatha sarvada tyaag kar dena chaiye
 The imagination of salvation of the Charvakas is also strongly influenced by the influence of their element, the epistemology and the knowledge epistemology
 jab tak sharir he tab tak manushya naanaa prakaar ke ksht sahataa he
 This is hell
 is ksht samooh se mukti tab milti he jab deh chaitanyarahit ho jaataa he arthath mar jaataa he
 It is salvation to die because the dead body dies experiencing any suffering
 yah maranaa hi moksh he kyonki mrit sharir ko kisi bhi ksht kaa anubhav nahin hota
 Although in other philosophies, the existence of the soul is acknowledged to be free and the nature of salvation is different in different philosophies, yet the Charvakas do not support their belief
 ve na to moksh ko nity maanate hue sanmaatr maanate hai, na nity maanate hue sat or chit swaroop maanate hai na hi ve sachchidanand swaroop main uski sthiti ko hi moksh sweekaar karte hai
 Charvak philosophy is a philosophy that is naturally beloved by the common man
 jis darshan ke vaakya chaaru arthath ruchikar hon vah charvak darshan he
 The practical and temporal aspect of all classical serious subjects is the Charvak philosophy
 sahaj rup main jo kuch ham karte hai vah sab kuch charvak darshan kaa aadhaar he
 Charvak Darshan looks at every aspect of life with ease
 jivan ke prati yah sahaj drushti hi charvak darshan he
 The reality is that every human life that lives in the world is a Charvak philosophy
 aise vaakya or siddhanth jo sabko romantic lagen lok main aayat yaa vishrut aavashya honge
 Probably this is the reason why we also know Charvak philosophy as Lokayat philosophy
 yah darshan barhospaty darshan ke naam se bhi vidwaanon main prasiddh he
 From this name, it appears that this philosophy is opposed by Jupiter
 brihaspati bhartiya samaaj main devataaon ke guru ke rup main maanya hai
 But Jupiter is not one in Indian literature
 charvak darshan ke pravartak acharya brihaspati koun hai, yah nirnay kar paanaa atyant kathin kaary he
 The mention of two Brihaspati in Aigaras and Laukya forms is found in the Rigveda
 ashwaghosh ke anusaar anigaras brihaspati rajshastra ke praneta hai
 The origin of the true substance is believed to be from Asat in the opinion of Laukya Jupiter
 isi prakaar asat padaarth kii utpatti sat se maani gayi he
 The roots are called discrete
 chetan padaarthon ko is manyata ke anusaar sat kaha jaataa hai
 The instruction of a Jupiter is also found in the Van Parva of Mahabharata
 yah brihaspati shukr kaa swaroop dhaaran kar indra kaa sarankshan evam daanvon kaa vinaash karne ke uddeshy se anaatmavaad yaa prapanch vigyaan kii sanrachana karata he
 As a result of this great science, considering the auspicious as inauspicious and inauspicious, demons get involved in criticism and blasphemy of Vedas and scriptures
 anya prasang main mahabharat main hi ek or brihaspati kaa varnan miltaa he jo shukracharya ke saath mil kar pravanchanashastra kii rachana karte hai
 If the teachers of various scriptures are to be believed, then the Charvak faith cannot be considered in the category of philosophy because in this philosophy, the work of deception is done only in the guise of sweet words
 yah baat or he ki yadi charvak kii sunen to vah bhi vibhinn shastragyon ko vanchak hi ghoshit karata he
 a description of such a Jupiter is found in the Taittriya Brahmana text that strikes the forehead of Gayatri Devi, Gayatri Devi has been considered as the origin of all the Vedas according to the Padma Purana
 is drushti se yah brihaspati veda kaa virdohi mana ja saktaa he
 Possibly because of opposing the Vedas, it would be reasonable to consider this Jupiter as the leader of the Charvak philosophy
 vishnu puraana main bhi brihaspati kaa prasang praapt hota he
 According to this belief of Jupiter, the Vedic ritual is practiced by the expenditure and effort of polygamy
 vividh sukh ke sadhak ye vaidic upaay kuch arth lolup swaarth kendrit dhurton kaa hi vidhaan he
 a description of the logical Jupiter is also found somewhere
 ye brihaspati veda ke anugami to avashya hai par tarksmmat anushthanon kaa hi samarthan karte hai
 From their point of view, the decision must be based on scripture, but it is absolutely necessary to maintain this classical research logic
 tark virahit chintan dharm ke nirdhaaran main kabhi bhi sarthak nahin ho saktaa he
 Vatsyayana Muni has mentioned Jupiter as the author of Arthashastra in his world famous book Kamasutra
 brihaspati dwaara virachit arthshaastra ke ek sutara ke anusaar shaastra ke rup main maatr lokayat ko hi manyata di gayi he
 As a result, it is very difficult to distinguish between Jupiter, the pioneer of economics and the originator of Lokayata Shastra
 kuch samalochakon ne arthshaastra ke evam lokayat shaastra ke nirmaataa ko abhinn maanane ke saath-saath kamasutron ke praneta bhi brihaspati hi hai, yah mana he
 If the fulfillment of cosmic desires is the aim of Charvak philosophy, then the founder of Kamasastra, Muni Vatsyayan, is Jupiter, it is only appropriate to believe
 kautilya ne arthshaastra main lokayat darshan kaa sahaj pratipaadan kiya he
 In this way, Kautilya, the creator of Arthashastra and Jupiter, the proponent of Lokayat philosophy, is the same
 koshkaar hemachandra ke anusaar arthshaastra, kamasutra, nyayasutra-bhashya, panchatantra evam chanakya niti ke rachayita ek hi he
 After such deliberation, the names of the Jupiter which are discussed in various contexts in Vedic Vamāya are clearly explained in this way
 padam puraana ke sandarbh main angira brahma ke maanas putr hai
 Angiras Brihaspati is the son of Angira and grandson of Brahma
 falat: inaki devon main gananaa hoti he
 In this way, there can be no distinction between Dev Guru Jupiter and Angiras Jupiter
 devon kii sangraksha ke liye devataaon ke guru dwaara asuron ko pradutt upadesh vibhinn lokon main aayat ho gaya yah kathan dev guru brihaspati ke sandarbh main vishwasaneey nahin ho saktaa
 Why would Asuras respect the teachings of Devguru under his guru Shukracharya? Therefore, no one is expected to be the originator of Charvaka philosophy other than Devguru
 kuch samalochakon ne spasht rup se sweekaar kiya he ki charvak ke guru brihaspati, swarg ke swami indra ke acharya vishwavikhyath brihaspati nahin hai
 This Brihaspati is the guru of a royal family
 aitihaasik drushti se denkhe to vasishtha, vishwamitra, dronacharya aadi kaa kisi rajkul kaa guru hona is manyata ko aadhaar bhi de rahaa he
 Just as Shankara philosophy is accepted as Shiromani in theistic philosophies, similarly the Charvak philosophy is undisputed as Shiromani as the most outstanding atheist among the atheist philosophies
 naastik shiromani charvak isliye bhi mana jaataa he ki vah vishwa main vishwaas ke aadhaar par kisi na kisi rup main maanya ishwar kii alokik sarvamaanya satta ko sire se nakaar detaa he
 According to them, there is no object named God in the world
 naastik shiromani charvak jo kuch bahari indriyon se dikhaai detaa he anubhoot hota he, usee kii satta ko sweekaar karata he
 This is the reason that no other proof is considered in the theory of Charvak except for the direct evidence
 jis ishwar kii kalpana anya darshanon main kii gai he uski satta pratyaksh pramaan se sambhav nahin he
 According to their opinion, it is unnecessary and laughable to assume the role of God in the seedling that emerges from the seed
 ankur kii utpatti to mitti evam jal ke sanyog se nitant swaabhaavik evam sahaj prakriya se sarvanubhav siddh he
 Approval of an unseen actor to complete this natural work is meaningless
 ishwar ko na maanane par jeev saamaanya ke shubh evam ashubh karmon ke fal kii vyavastha kaise sambhav hogi? is prashn kaa samaadhaan karte hue charvak poochta he ki kis karm fal kii vyavastha apekshit? sansar main do prakaar ke karm dekhe jate hai
 One is cosmic and the other is supernatural action
 kya aap loukik karmon ke fal kii vyavastha ke sambandh main chintit hai? yadi haan, to yah chintaa anaavashyak he
 Legislative deeds result in legislation, which is the only accepted king or administrator in the world
 yah sarvanubhav siddh tathy, pratyaksh hi he
 We see that the charitable deeds, etc
, prohibit those who perform the prohibited work, by sending them the proper fruits of their misdeeds, as Lok Siddha Raja, in the prison etc
 as punishment
 isi prakaar kisi kii praan raksha aadi shubh karm karne vaale purush ko raja hi puraskaar rup main sufal arthath dhan dhaany evam sammaan se vibhooshit kar detaa he
 If you are truthful about the arrangement of the fruits of supernatural actions, then you should not worry too
 kyonki parloukik fal kii drushti se vihit ye sabhi yajna, puja, paath tapasya aadi vaidic karm jan saamaanya ko thagne kii drushti se tathaa apni aajeevika evam udar ke bharan poshan ke liye kuch dhurton dwaara kalpit hue hai
 In fact, Agnihotra, the three Vedas, the wearing of Tridand and the devouring of Bhasma from place to place in the body are the only sign of wisdom and effortlessness
 in vaidic karmon kaa fal aaj tak kisi ko bhi drushti gochar nahin hua he
 If Vedic deeds had any fruit, it would have been evident to someone till date
 at: aaj tak kisi ko bhi in vaidic yaa varnashram-vyavastha se sambaddh karmon kaa fal-swarg, moksh, devloak gaman aadi pratyaksh anubhuti nahin he at: ye samast vaidic karm nishphal hi hai, yah swat: yukti purvak siddh ho jaataa he
 Here if the believer says that the trade that proves the heavens etc
 is unseen or religion and unrighteousness which leads to the attainment of heaven, then it is not acceptable to Charvak
 alokik adrusht kaa khandan karte hue charvak swarg aadi paralok ke saadhan main adrusht kii bhoomika ko nirast karata he tathaa is prakaar aastik darshan ke mul par hi kutharaghaat kar detaa he
 This is the reason that along with the abrogation of heaven and heaven, which is proven on the basis of the unseen, as well as the regulator or administrator of this unseen, the God also becomes spontaneous in the Charvak faith
 charvak mat main koi jeev sharir se bhinn nahin he
 The body is the soul or soul
 falat: sharir kaa vinaash jab mrityu ke uparant dah sanskaar hone ke baad ho jaataa he tab jeev yaa jeevatma bhi vinasht ho jaataa he
 The solution of four or five mahabhutas in the body is the reason for enlightenment
 yah jeev mrityu ke anantar paralok jaataa he yah manyata bhi, sharir ko hi chetan yaa aatma sweekaar karne se niraadhaar hi siddh hoti he
 Even the ultimate effort of salvation as defined in the scriptures does not accept Charvaka
 chetan sharir kaa naash hi is mat main moksh he
 Due to the absence of religion and unrighteousness, there is no invisible heaven and hell etc
 in the Charvak theory, there is no invisible heaven and hell, etc
 It is proved unintended
 charvak mat main sharir ko hi aatma maan lene par baalyavastha main anubhoot kanduk kreedaa aadi kaa vriddhavastha yaa yuvavastha main samaran kaise hota he? yah ek jvalant prashn sahaj hi uth khadaa hota he
 It cannot be said here that the body of childhood, the body of old age and the body of youth are the same
 yadi teenon avasthaaon kaa sharir ek hi hota to in teenon avasthaaon ke shariron main itnaa bada antar nahin hota
 From the difference, it is clearly proved that the components of the body which are meat bodies etc
 increase and decrease
 tathaa in hraas evam vruddhi ke kaaran hi baalyavastha ke sharir kaa naash evam yuvavastha ke sharir kii utpatti hoti he yah bhi siddh hota he
 If you say that this is the same body in the body of puberty, because of this behavior, the above remembrance can be generated by considering the body as one, then this statement also cannot be justified
 kyonki yah vahi sharir he yah pratybhigyaan to swaroop evam akruti kii samanta ke kaaran hota he
 As a result, the bodies of both the states cannot be considered integral
 aisi sthiti main purv darshit balya-kaal ke samaran ko sampann karne ke liye charvak balykaal ke sharir main utpann krida se janya sanskaar duusare yuva-kaal ke sharir main apane jaise hi naye sanskaar paidaa kar dete hai
 In the same way, the rites existing in the body of puberty produce the same rites in the body of old age
 etavata in baalyavastha ke sanskaron ke udbodhan se charvak mat main samaran bina kisi baadha ke ho jaataa he
 After all, in Charvak philosophy, the body is the soul, it proves to be natural
 yadi sharir hi aatma he to charvak se yah poocha ja saktaa he ki 'mam shariram' yah meraa sharir he, aisa loksiddh jo vyavhaar he vah kaise utpann hoga? is vyavhaar se to yah prathit ho rahaa he ki sharir alag he evam sharir kaa swami koi or he, jo sharir se bhinn aatma hi he
 Addressing this question, Charvak says that even though the head of a particular demon has been called Rahu, the common man 'rahu's head' behaves in a very natural way, in the same way that the body itself is a soul
 This popular practice will also be born as 'my body'
 charvaakon main kuch charvak indriyon ko hi aatma maanane par indriya ke nasht hone par samaran kii aapatti kaa niraas nahin ho paata he
 Some charvakas have also considered soul and mind as soul
 sharir hi aatma he yah siddh karne ke liye charvak is veda ke sandarbh ko bhi aastikon ke santosh ke liye prastut karata he
 This Vedic text implies that 'a spirit with science originates from these ghosts and finally merges with these ghosts
 yah bhuton main sharir swaroop aatma kaa vilay hi mrityu he

 thirumavalwan, ek dalit kaaryakarta, 15veen loksabhaa main sansad sadsy or bharat ke tamilnadu rajya kii ek dalit raajnneetik party, vidoodalai chirutagal kachi ke maujuuda adhyaksh hai

 srilanka ke mudde ko samarthan dene ke liye unhone reliyaan, bahishkaar or sammelnon ko yojit karnaa shuru kiya
 He visited Madras Law College, but was unsuccessful
 unhone kaha ki aisa, kathith taur par unke dalit hone ke kaaran tha
 After this incident he met party leaders of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, a major political party in Tamil Nadu
 1988 main, dakshini shahar madurai main sarkari forencik vibhaag main kaam karte hue, unki mulaakaat dalit panthars of india, daliton ke adhikaar ke liye ladane vaala ek sanghathan ke tamilnadu rajya sanyojak malachami se hui
 The next year after Malaichami's death, Thirumavalavan was elected the leader of the DPI

 As part of his work, he started visiting the Dalit villages of the Madurai region and began to understand the problems faced by the Dalits
 1992 main do daliton kii hatya ne, ve kehete hai, unhen or adhik ugravadi bana diya
 Against the backdrop of rising Dalit assertiveness, he emerged as one of the two prominent Dalit leaders in Tamil Nadu, who had a vast base of lower-level support, particularly in the southern districts of Tamil Nadu

 In the 2009 general election, Thirumavalavan was elected to parliament from Chidambaram Lok Sabha constituency
 thirumavalwan kii raajnneeti tamil rashtrawaad ko punarparibhaashit karne par aadhaarit he, jo ise jati vyavastha ke unmoolan ke liye ek bal ke rup main parivartit karnaa chaahati he
 The oppression of Dalits, he says, is institutionalized in India, including in Tamil Nadu
 haalanki dravid partiyaan jo tamilnadu kii raajnneeti par haaavee hai, ve jaati vyavastha ke unmoolan ke liye vaicharik rup se patibaddh hai, thirumavalwan kaa tark he ki ve log vyavhaar main dravid andolan ke mul aadarshon se dur ho gaye hai
 They say that their policies have mainly benefited the middle castes and actually increased the oppression of Dalits where the Brahmins have been replaced by the middle castes in a tyrannical form
 dalit, dravid partiyon se zyada madad kii ummid nahin kar sakate or unhen karnaa bhi nahin chahie
 According to Thirumavalavan, the solution lies in Tamil nationalism

 mahabharat pracheen bharat kaa sabase bada mahakavy he
 It is also a religious book
 isamen us samay kaa itihaas lagbhag 1,11,000 shlokon main likhaa hua he
 The complete narrative of this is summarized as follows
 puraano ke anusaar brahma ji se atri, atri se chandramaa, chandramaa se budh or budh se ilanandan pururava kaa janm hua
 Pururva was born from age, age to King Nahusha and Nahusha to Yayati
 yayati se puru hue
 The dynasty of Puru included Bharata and King Kuru in the clan of Bharata
 kuru ke vansh main shantanu kaa janm hua
 Ganganandan Bhishma was born from Shantanu
 unke do chote bhai or the - chitrangad or vichitraveery
 They were born from Shantanu in the womb of Satyavati
 shantanu ke swarglok chale jane par bhishma ne avivaahit rah kar apane bhai vichitraveery ke rajya kaa paalan kiya
 Chitrangad was killed in his childhood by Gandharva named Chitrangad
 phir bhishma sangram main vipakshi ko parrast karke kashiraj kii do kanyaon - ambika or ambalika ko har laaye
 They were both Vichitravirya's women
 kuch kaal ke baad raja vichitraveery rajyakshma se grast ho swargavaasi ho gayi
 Then with the permission of Satyavati, Pandas were born from Vyasji from the womb of Ambika and Dhritarashtra from the womb of Ambika
 dhritarashtra ne gandhari ke garbh se sau putron ko janm diya, jinamein duryodhana sabase bada tha or pandu ke yudhistor,bhim,arjuna,nakul,sahadev aadi paanch putr hue
 Dhritarashtra was blind since birth, so Pandu was made king in his place, Dhritarashtra always got angry at his blindness and started to hate Pandu
 pandu ne sampoorn bharatvarsh ko jitkar kuru rajya kii simaao kaa yawano ke desh tak vistaar kar diya
 Once King Pandu along with his two wives - Kunti and Madri - went to the forest for hunting
 vahaan unhen ek mrug kaa maithunarat joda drushtigat hua
 Pandu immediately wounded the deer with his arrow
 marate huye mrigarupadhari nirdosh rishi ne pandu ko shaap diya, "rajan! tumhaare samaan krur purush is sansar main koi bhi nahin hoga
 You have shot me at the time of sexual intercourse, so whenever you become pregnant, you will die
 " Pandu was deeply saddened by this curse and said to his queens, "ladies! Now i will abandon all my lusts and stay in this forest, you go back to Hastinapur
" After listening to their words, both queens grieved and said, " Nath! We cannot live for a single moment without you
 aap hamen bhi van main apane saath rakhane kii krupa kijiye
 "pandu accepted his request and allowed him to live with him in the forest
 isi dauraan raja pandu ne amavasya ke din rishi-muniyon ko brahma ji ke darshanon ke liye jate huye dekha
 He urged those sages and sages to take themselves along
 unke is aagrah par rishi-muniyon ne kaha, "rajan! koi bhi nihsantaan purush brahmalok jane kaa adhikari nahin ho saktaa atah ham aapako apane saath le jane main asamarth hai
 After listening to the sages, Pandu said to his wife, "O Kunti!" My birth is getting worse because childless person cannot get rid of father-debt, sage-loan, god-loan and man-loan
 Can you help me to get a son? "kunti said," o Aryaputra ! Durvasa Rishi has given me such a mantra by which i can get the desired thing by invoking any god
 aap ajna karen main kis devtaa ko bulaauun
 "at this, Pandu ordered to invite religion
 dharm ne kunti ko putr pradaan kiya jiskaa naam yudhisthir rakhaa gaya
 Later, Pandu ordered Kunti to invite Vayudev and Indradev twice
 vayudev se bhim tathaa indra se arjuna kii utpatti hui
 After this, by the command of Pandu, Kunti initiated the mantra to Madri
 maadri ne ashwanikumaron ko aamantrit kiya or nakul tathaa sahadev kaa janm hua
 One day King Pandu was touring along the Madri on the banks of Sarita in the forest
 vaataavaran atyant ramnik tha or sheethal-mand-sugandhit vaayu chal rahi thi
 Suddenly Madri's dress flew away with the wind
 isse pandu kaa man chanchal ho uthaa or ve maithun main pravruth huye hi the ki shaapvash unki mrityu ho gai
 Madri sati with them, but Kunti returned to Hastinapur for the upbringing of her sons
 vahaan rahane vaale rishi muni pando ko rajmahal chhod kar aa gayi, rishi muni tathaa kunti ke kehane par sabhi ne pando ko pandu kaa putr maan liya or unka swaagat kiya
 When Kunti was not married, Karna was born from her womb at the same time
 parantu lok laaj ke bhay se kunti ne karn ko ek bakse main band karke ganga nadi main bahaya
 As Karna was drifting in Gangaji, Adhiratha, the charioteer of Maharaj Dhritarashtra and his wife Radha saw him and adopted him and began to follow him
 kumaar awastha se hi karn kii ruchi apane pita adhirath ke samaan rath chalaane ki bajaae yudhkala main adhik thi
 Karna and his father Adhirath Acharya met Drona, who was one of the best masters of martial arts at that time
 dronacharya us samay kuru rajkumaron ko shiksha diya karte the
 He refused to teach Karna as Karna was a charioteer and Drona only taught Kshatriyas
 dronacharya kii asammati ke uparant karn ne parashuram se sampark kiya jo ki keval brahmanon ko hi shiksha diya karte the
 Karna, calling himself a Brahmin, urged Parasurama for education
 parashuram ne karn kaa aagrah sweekaar kiya or karn ko apane samaan hi yudhkala or dhanurvidya main nishnaat kiya
 In this way Karna became an extremely hard working and accomplished disciple of Parashurama
 karn duryodhana ke aashray main rahata tha
 Daiva Yoga and the deceit of Shakuni ignited the fire of hatred among the Kauravas and the Pandavas
 duryodhana badi khoti buddhi kaa manushya tha
 At the behest of Shakuni, he tried to kill Pandavo many times in his childhood
 yuvavastha main aakar jab guno main usase adhik shreshth yudhishthar ko yuvaraj bana diya gaya to shakuni ne laksh ke bane hue bhawan main pandavon ko rakhkar aag lagaakar unhen jalaane kaa praytn kiya kintu vidura kii sahaayta se paanchon pandav apni mata ke saath us jalte hue ghar se baahar nikal gayi
 From there, he moved to Ekachakra city and resided in the house of a Brahmin under the guise of Muni
 phir bak naamak rakshas kaa vadh karke vyas ji ke kehane par ve paanchal-rajya main, jahaan draupadi kaa swayamvar honevaala tha, gaye
 The five Pandavas received Draupadi as a wife in the panchal-state, when Arjuna's goal-breaking skills led to fisheries
 draupadi swayamvar ke pehle vidura ko chhod kar sabhi pando ko mrit samajhane lage or is kaaran dhritarashtra ne is kaaran shakuni ke kehane par duryodhana ko yuvaraj bana diya
 After Draupadi Swayamvar, Duryodhana etc
 came to know of Pandavas being alive
 pando ne kauravon se apana rajya maanga parantu grihayuddh ke sankat se bachane ke All Pandavas were proficient in all types of learning
 pandavon ne sampoorn dishaao par vijay pai or yudhisthir rajya karne lage
 He performed the Rajsuya Yagna, complete with abundant gold
 unka yah vaibhav duryodhana ke liye asay ho uthaa
 He took Shakuni along at the behest of his brother-in-law and suzerainty of glory, instigating gambling in gambling, conquering Yudhishthira with his brothers, Draupadi and his kingdom laughing through treachery
 duryodhana ne kuru rajya sabha main draupadi kaa bahut apmaan kiya, use nirvastr karne k prayaas kiya
 Sri Krishna gave his shame and then Draupadi was about to curse all the people, but Gandhari came and stopped it from happening
 saath hi main jue main parrast hokar yudhisthir apane bhaaiyon ke saath van main chale gayi
 There he spent twelve years according to his vow
 ve van main bhi pehle hi kii bhanti pratidin bahusankhyak brahmanon ko bhojan karaate the
 Surpassed Durvasa with eighty-eight thousand Dwijas
 vahaan unke saath unki patni draupadi or purohit dhaumyaji bhi the
 After the twelfth year, he went to Virat Nagar
 vahaan yudhisthir sabase aparichit rahakar 'kank' naamak brahman ke rup main rahane lage
 Bhimsen was a cook
 arjuna ne apana naam 'brihannalaa' rakhaa tha
 The Pandava wife Draupadi resided in Ranivas as Sairandhri
 isi prakaar nakul-sahadev ne bhi apane naam badal liye the
 Bhimsen killed Keechaka who wanted to kill Draupadi at night
 tatpashchaat kaurav viraat kii gauon ko harkar le jane lage, tab unhen arjuna ne parrast kiya
 At that time, Kauravas recognised the Pandavas
 shrikrishna kii bahan subhadra ne arjuna se abhimanyu naamak putr ko utpann kiya tha use raja viraat ne apni kanya uttara byaah di
 Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, being the lord of seven Akshauhini army, agreed to fight with the Kauravas
 pehle bhagwaan shrikrishna param krodhi duryodhana ke paas doot banakar gayi
 He told King Duryodhana, the lord of eleven Akshauhini army- 'rajan! tum yudhisthir ko aadha rajya de do yaa unhen paanch hi gaanv arpit kar do; nahin to unke saath yuddh karo
 ' shrikrishna kii baat sunakar duryodhana ne kaha- 'main unhen sui kii nok ke baraabar bhoomi bhi nahin doongaa; haan, unase yuddh avashya karunga
 ' aisa kahkar vah bhagwaan shrikrishna ko bandi banane ke liye udyat ho gaya
 At that time, Lord Shri Krishna frightened Duryodhana in the Rajya Sabha by having a vision of his supreme evil form
 phir vidura ne apane ghar le jaakar bhagwaan kaa pujan or satkar kiya
 He then returned to Yudhishthira and said- 'maharaj! You fight with Duryodhana ' yudhisthir or duryodhana kii senaayen kurukshetra ke maidan main ja datin
 Seeing the fathers Bhishma and Acharya Drona, etc
, in their opposition, Arjuna was overcome by war, then Lord Shri Krishna said to him - "partha! Bhishma etc
 Gurujanas are not worthy of grief
 manushya kaa sharir vinashshil he, kintu aatma kaa kabhi naash nahin hota
 This soul is Parabrahma
 'main brahm hoon'- is prakaar tum us aatma ko samajho
 Follow the Kshatradharma by taking the shelter of Karmayog by remaining equal in the accomplishment and imperfection of the work
 " On the saying of Shri Krishna, Arjuna became angry and incurred war
 unhone shankhadhwani kii
 In Duryodhana's army, the first grandfather was Bhishma Senapati
 pandavon ke senapati shikhandi the
 Heavy war broke out in both of them
 bhishmasahit kaurav paksh ke yoddha us yuddh main pandav-paksh ke sainikon par prahaar karne lage or shikhandi aadi pandav- paksh ke vir kaurav-sainikon ko apane baanon kaa nishaanaa banane lage
 That war between the Kauravas and the Pandava-army looked like the devasur-sangram
 akaash main khadey hokar dekhne vaale devataaon ko vah yuddh bada anandadaayak prathit ho rahaa tha
 Bhishma fought for ten days and killed most of the Pandava army with his arrows
 dasven din arjuna ne veeravar bhishma par baanon kii badi baari vrishti kii
 Here, with the inspiration of Drupada, Shikhandi also put arrows on Bhishma like a rain-fed cloud
 donon ore ke hathisvaar, ghudsavaar, rathi or paidal ek-duusare ke baanon se maare gayi
 Bhishma's death was subject to his will
 jab pandavon ko ye samaj main aa gaya kii bhishma ke rahete wo is yuddh ko nahin jeet sakate to shrikrishna ke suzav par unhone bhishma pitamah se hi unki mrityu kaa upaay poocha
 unhone kaha ki jab tak mere haath main shastr he tab tak mahadev ke atirikt mujhe koi nahin haraa saktaa
 unhone ne hi pandavon ko suzav diya ki shikhanchamdi ko saamne karke yuddh lade
 wo jaanate the ki shikhandi purv janm main amba thi isliye wo use kanya hi maanate the
 In the 10th day of the war, Arjuna placed Shikhandi on his chariot
 Looking at Shikhandi, Bhishma gave up his bow
 unke shastr tyaagane ke baad arjuna ne unhen baano ki shayya par sula diya
 He began to spend time meditating and praising Lord Vishnu waiting for Uttarayana
 bhishma ke baan-shayya par gir jane ke baad jab duryodhana shok se vyakul ho uthaa, tab acharya dron ne senapatitv kaa bhaar grahan kiya
 On the other hand, celebrating the joy of the Pandavas army, Dhritadhyuman was the commander
 un donon main bada bhayankar yuddh hua, jo yamalok kii aabaadi ko badhaane vaala tha
 Virat and Drupada etc
 drowned in the sea of king Dronopi
 us samay dron kaal ke samaan jaan padate the
 At the same time, there was a sound in his ears that 'ashwatthama was killed'
 itnaa sunate hi acharya dron ne astr shastr tyaag diye
 At such a time, they fell on the earth, hurt by the arrows of Dhrishtumun
 dron bade hi durdharsh the
 He was killed on the fifth day by destroying the entire Kshatriyas
 duryodhana pun: shok se aatur ho uthaa
 At that time Karna became the helm of his army
 pandav-sena kaa aadhipaty arjuna ko mila
 Karna and Arjuna had a great battle involving the destruction of weapons and weapons, which was also going to defeat dewasur-sangram
 karn or arjuna ke sangram main karn ne apane baanon se shatru-paksh ke bahut-se veeron kaa sanhaar kar daalaa; yadhyapi yuddh gatirodhpurna ho rahaa tha lekin karn tab ulajh gaya jab uske rath kaa ek pahiyaa dharti main dhans gaya 
 He also finds himself unable to use divine weapons, as was the curse of his mentor Parashurama
 tab karn apane rath ke pahie ko nikaalane ke liye neeche utarataa he or arjuna se nivedan karata he ki vah yuddh ke niyamon kaa paalan karte hue kuch der ke liye usapar baan chalaanaa band kar de
 Sri Krishna then tells Arjuna that Karna has no right to talk about war rules and religion, whereas he himself did not follow any war rules and religion at the time of Abhimanyu slaughter
 unhone aage kaha ki tab uskaa dharm kahan gaya tha jab usne divya-janma draupadi ko puri kuru rajsabha ke samaksh vaishya kaha tha
 Where did his religion go in the sports hall? isliye ab use koi adhikaar nahin kii vah kisi dharm yaa yuddh niyam kii baat kare or unhone arjuna se kaha ki abhi karn asahaay he isliye vah uskaa vadh kare
 Sri Krishna says that if Arjuna had not yet killed Karna at this decisive turn, the Pandavas would probably never be able to kill him and this war could never be won
 tab, arjuna ne ek divine astr kaa upyog karte hue karn kaa sir dhad se alag kar diya
 After Karna's body fell to the ground, a flame emerged from Karna's body and was absorbed into the sun
 
 Subsequently, King Shalya became the commander of the Kaurava army, but he could last only half a day in the war
 dopaher hote-hote raja yudhisthir ne unhen maar diya
 Dropped
 duryodhana kii praaia: sari sena yuddh main maari gayi thi
 Ultimately he had a war with Bhimsen
 usne pandav-paksh ke paidal aadi bahut-se sainikon kaa vadh karke bhimsen par dhaava kiya
 At that time, Duryodhana's other younger brother was also killed by Bhimsen while hitting him with mace
 mahabharat-sangram ke us atharahawein din ratrikaal main mahabali ashwatthama ne pandavon kii soyi hui ek akshuhinee sena ko sadaa ke liye sula diya
 He did not leave even the five sons of Draupadi, his Panchaldesya brothers and Dhritadumayan alive
 draupadi putraheen hokar rone-bilakhane lagi
 Then Arjuna defeated Ashwatthama with Sink's weapon and took out the gem of his forehead
 
 Ashwatthama Even so, the evil Ashwatthama used weapons on him to destroy Uttara's womb
 vah garbh uske astr se praaia: dagdh ho gaya tha; kintu bhagwaan shrikrishna ne usko pun: jivan-daan diya
 The same unborn child of Uttara later became known as King Parikshit
 kritavarma, kripacharya tathaa ashwatthama- ye teen kauravapaksheeya vir us sangram se jivit bache
 On the other hand, five Pandavas, Satyakis and Lord Krishna - only seven could survive; No one else was left
 us samay sab ore anath striyon kaa aartnaad vyaapt ho rahaa tha
 Yudhishthira, along with Bhimsen etc
 brothers, consoled him and cremated all the heroes killed in the battlefield and donated Jalanjali money for them

 Then he came to the throne
 iske baad un shatrumardan raja ne ashwamedh yajna karke usamen brahmanon ko bahut dhan daan kiya
 Subsequently, upon hearing the news of the destruction of the Yadavas by mutual war from the curse received by Arjuna from the mouth of Arjuna, who returned from Dwarka, Yudhishthira placed Parikshit on Rajasana and went to Swargaloka with Mahaprasthan himself
 jab yudhisthir rajsinghaasana par virajman ho gayi, tab dhritarashtra grihasth-ashram se vanprastha-ashram main pravisht ho van main chale gayi
 He was accompanied by Goddess Gandhari and Prutha
 vidura ji dawanal se dagdh ho swarg sidhaare
 In this way, Lord Vishnu took the burden of the earth and killed the demon-monster etc
 by establishing the Pandavas for the establishment of religion and destroying unrighteousness

 Balabhadra ji was the form of Sheshnag, so he took shelter of the heavenly paradise
 avinashi bhagwaan srihari dhyani purushon ke dhyey hai
 After his incursion, the sea left his private residence and immersed the rest of Dwarkapuri in its waters
 arjuna ne mare hue yadavon kaa dah-sanskaar karke unke liye jalanjali di or dhan aadi kaa daan kiya
 Walked to Hastinapur with the queens of Lord Krishna, who were previously Apsaras and appeared in human form by Ashtavakra's curse
 maarg main danda liye hue bhilo ne arjuna kaa tiraskaar karke un sabko chin liya
 This was also possible due to Ashtavakra's curse
 isse arjuna ke man main bada shok hua
 Then, on giving consolation to Maharishi Vyas, he decided that 'I was strong only by being near Lord Shri Krishna
 ' hastinapur main aakar unhone bhaaiyon sahit raja yudhisthir se, jo us samay prajavarg kaa paalan karte the, yah sab samachar nivedan kiya
 He said - 'bhaiya! vahi dhanush he, ve hi baan hai, vahi rath he or ve hi ghode hai, kintu bhagwaan shrikrishna ke bina sab kuch usee prakaar nasht ho gaya, jaise ashrotriy ko diya hua daan
 Hearing this, Dharmaraja Yudhishthira installed Parikshit on the kingdom
 iske baad budhimhan raja sansar kii anityata kaa vichaar karke draupadi tathaa bhaaiyon ko saath le himalay kii taraf mahaprasthaan ke path par agrasar hue
 Draupadi, Sahadeva, Nakula, Arjuna and Bhimsen fell one by one respectively in that Mahapath
 isse raja shokmagn ho gayi
 Afterwards, he climbed the chariot brought by Indra and went to heaven along with the brothers
 vahaan unhone duryodhana aadi sabhi dhritarashtraputron ko dekha
 After that i saw Lord Vasudev also, he was very happy with this, i have told you the incident of Mahabharata
