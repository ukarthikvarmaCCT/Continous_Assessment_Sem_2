 But the pension of an earlier retired military could not be increased in the same proportion
 “swatantra bharat main koi bhi bhukh se nahin maregaa

 iske sabase achche vetan paane vaale adhikari iske sabase kam vetan paane vaale sainiko se bahut zyada nahin kamaayenge
 And it will not be expensive or difficult to get justice here ”
 sardaar vallabhbhai patel The pension of soldiers cannot be compared to general government employees because on the one hand, while military officers and general government employees get the salary for 60 years, the soldiers of the military class have to retire in the year itself and their Service conditions are also more difficult
 angrejon ke samay main sainik varg ke phogiyon kii pension tankhwaah kii kareeb 80 pratishat hoti thi jabaki sainya adhikari varg evam saamaanya sarkari karmchaaree kii 33 pratishat hua karti thi

 As much as he and his family have
 pehali ladai apane swabhimaan kii honi chahie, bhedbhaav khatm karne kii honi chahie
 There is a demand of the soldiers that from 1 April 2014 this scheme should be implemented with the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission
 The soldiers say that if we want to bring real balance, then we should also retire on 60 years
 We are retired only after 33 years and after that we spend our whole life with pension
 While other employees get full salary for 60 years
 In such a situation, the percentage of our pension should not be reduced
 baharhaal is vakt ye faujee sirf itnaa hi chaahate hai ki chathe vetan ayog ko lagu karte hue samaan pad or samaan samay tak sarvice kar chuke phogiyon ko ek samaan pension di jaay, chaahe donon kisi bhi saal main ritair hue hon

Isn't it rewarded for a medal whenever a gallant of the army shows unmatched bravery and skill for the country? Are medals given only to ketchup colonels? Friends reconcile between the Madal Return Gang and the lack of transparency in the allocation of medals in the Indian Armed Forces

 From the English mentality of freedom slavery

 swaraj unch neech afasar jawan hindu muslim in bhedbhaavon se

 Will full military Swaraj be achieved by fighting and winning some cases ?? The devil has wings
 magar achchhai dhime dhime apane astitv ko ubhartee he
 Are we ready for a long battle for Sainik Swaraj ??? 5

 All the soldiers should not be given fake certificates by discriminating in education and certificates given during the service
 afasaron kii ye sab shaitani manshaa sainiko ko unke sabase bade adhikaar padhai se dur rakhane kii he
 Sainik Swaraj means that only the exercises of all the army from recognized educational institutions in India should be counted
 16
 swaraj he har hindustani kaa empowerment
 Swaraj is skill India
 swaraj he 60 pratishat sainikon kaa sammaan purvak pramotion se afasar bananaa
 17
 Sainik Swaraj is that both soldiers and officers get equal respect if injured or hurt in war or other times
 galentry award, medal aabantan ho chaahe disability pension yaa shahid kii vidhwaa ko pension aabantan in jagahon par ho rahe bhedbhaav akshamya he
 Swaraj should be brought here immediately
 18
 baapu ne kaha tha jab tak ham hindustanio ke andar se ham angreziyat ko nikaal nahin dete tab tak angarez agar chale bhi jaye kya phayda?? 19
 This discrimination is false, untrue, theft, corruption will be away from the heart of every Indian, only then will the true Sainik Swaraj come
 20
 gandhiji ne kaha tha agar angrez bhartiya samskruthik mulya jaise kii sammaan samanvay apana lete he to unhen ham bhartiya sweekaar karenge
 21
 The thing found with fear will only last as long as there is fear
 ham ko man kii shakti dena man vijay karen
 Hail yourself before the victory of others
 ham ko man kii shakti dena
 Discrimination should discriminate from your heart
 doston se bhul ho to maaf kar saken
 Avoid falsehoods, let the truth prevail
 dusron kii jai se pehle khud ko jai karen
 Give us the power of mind and win the mind
 dusron kii jai se pehle khud ko jai karen
 Give us the power of mind
 mushkilen paden to ham pe itnaa karm kar, saath de to dharm kaa, chalem to dharm par, khud pe hausala rahe, badi se naa daren

 As far as i have a little knowledge about the difference between the salary and allowances of the Army from the Third Pay Commission to the Seventh Pay Commission and the salary of Civilian employees, i want to throw some light on that and why the Army was downgraded from Civilian
 First of all, i cite the reason that the army and other police force organizations are a disciplined organization and are always determined to follow the above instructions literally and for this they have given up their lives to sacrifice their lives
 Such countrymen believe xxrep 5 
 because we cannot open our mouths under any circumstances
 The government and sly bureaucrats and ministers of the government took advantage of this by continuously reducing the salary and pension of the soldiers of our three armies and JCO rank soldiers at the time of the Third Pay Commission, when the basic pay scale of a soldier was only 175
 Rs
 235 per month and annual increase of Rs
 5 / - per month of our army by the top officers of our army
 Ignored such a big discrepancy
 Even due to low service and early retirement of soldiers, pension was fixed at 75% of the last pay scale, that too was reduced to 50% of the last salary of civilian employees at the same rate, that too after serving 33 years
 xxrep 4 
 The army was still silent, but the Pay Commission did not understand the effort to know how a young man whose total service is 15 years would get 50% of the last pension
 The result which the young man was getting 75% reached 35% and Civilian employees used to take 35% and it reached 50%
 If the top officers of our army had expressed their opposition to this injustice at that time, this situation would not have happened today
 Now the Sixth Pay Commission has exempted 50% of the last basic salary of government employees from the rule of service of 33 years and all civilian government employees have benefited in pension and have also received arrears but no separate notification in the army Withdrawal of which 50% pension formula is still applicable to the army for 33 years of service, i

 But the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission again broke the back of the army personnel and the jcos completely 


 which i have a record and whose resistance even the army soldiers could not do due to fear and discipline but The educated and highly trained aircraft of the Air Force were done by the personnel with technical knowledge and in return, the Air Force did a court martial by punishing all such air soldiers with a job
 Outside the fort and likewise, after thinking his future in the army was bleak, many airmen of other sergeant level took the WAG premature retirement of the event, 90% of them were lucky to be in the most nationalized banks from the clerk-cum-cashier to the branch manager
 Kar continued to work for the entire 60 years
 Well later when the army and navy also started opposing it, then again the government raised a special pay revision committee for soldiers from army personnel to JCO level again
 The revised Betman was implemented again from 10 Oct 1996 whereas earlier it was implemented by the Pay Commission from 01 Jan 1996
 But in this jco's Nave Subedar was considered to be of the same rank as Sub Inspector of Police and kept Subedar as Inspector level and Subedar Major was given the same as Subedar by giving only one additional bethan increment but when it came to equal pay scale of police then The government has agreed that the pay scale of the army should not be less than the police but should be equal to or more than that and the then Honorable Defense Minister Mulayam Singh has always asked the army to give high priority and due to his personal efforts, the army personnel were kept higher than the civil servants or the police, due to which the Fifth Pay Commission was again In the revised pay scale, jcos and jawans started getting higher pay scales from the same level of civilian employees and the lowest pay scale of a soldier was 3250 / - while that of lower division clerk was 3050 / - but still this bureaucrats are behind in playing their tricks
 The pay scale of NB Subedar y Group, however, started from Rs 5620 / - and Subedar y Group started from Rs 6600 / - while Sub Inspector of Police was 5500 / - and Inspector
 Rank was started from 6500 / - but kept the annual increase of Rs

 Now is the time to wake up and strengthen the voice of the entire military organization by rising above selfishness
 The three Chiefs have rejected the Pay Commission report in the current situation and requested the government to once again remove the incongruities
 
 We have to fight our own battles together because it is also a karma war and Sri Krishna of Mahabharata is a crusade where the Holocaust and the dishonest people are certain
 We are not sad that why the government has not removed our salary discrepancies, we are sad when the government adopts a rigid Rabia on the legitimate demands of the soldiers who are willing to sacrifice their lives, that is the government's indiscipline and strike of civilian employees
 She succumbs to the threat and accepts their legitimate and illegitimate demands
 After all, a soldier also has his own house and family, which also has the same needs as other civil servants
 rashan main bhi bhedbhaav !! After all, why could we not change the two-level food system made by the British in the Indian Army, even though the country has become 70 years old and we are still carrying forward the arrangement made by the British
 shaayad bharatiya sainya adhikariyon ko bhi yah nahi pataa ki kyon angrej adhikariyon kii rasoi or nivas sthaan bhartiya sainikon se alag hota tha
 i wanted to raise the same issue in this forum that after closing the windows from all over the house and covering the curtains, the inside people can be covered in the eyes of the outsiders but the condition of the people inside the interned slaves Gets worse
 jab tak vyavastha paardarshee nahi hogi tab tak is tarah kii samasyaye baar baar aayengi
 After all, why the CAG is not audited inside our army
 aakhir hamaari vyavastha teen stareey audit ke babajood bhi kaig kii chetabani kaa kaaran kyon bani
 What is our three-tier audit system and which is it
 unit audit, local audit or test audit yah tino puri tarah fail he kyonki bade bade ghotaale huye he or lagaataar ho rahe he
 Apart from the five countries of the world, there are no three different eateries in the army in any country, nor there is any discrimination in the quantity and quality of ration of soldiers or military officers, but here
 jahaan par bhedbhaav tha bhi vahaan par un deshon me yah vyavastha samaapt kar di gayi magar bharat me yah angrejon kii subidhanusaar banaayi vyavastha ko desh kii aazaadee ke sattar saal baad bhi badastoor jari he
 This leads to discrimination and dissatisfaction
 jaraa yah bhi gaur kare ki kyon afasaron ke bhojanalay sainiko ke bhojanalayon se alag hote the
 There were two important reasons for this which cannot be justified in today's time
 pehla kaaran yah tha ki angrej adhikari hote the or bhartiya nimnastar ke adhikari evam sainik hote the or angrejo kaa khan- paan or aadat alag thi
 For example, that bread was water, i
e
 their food was 70% readymade and packed food which came from Bidesh or from Britain and the British officers themselves used to pay from their salaries and there was no payment from the budget of Royal Indian Army
 lekin bhartiya sainiko kaa bhojan or khaane kii aadate purna rup se bhartiya thi or unako taaja bhojan kii jarurat hoti thi jo mukhya rup se bhartiya kichin me hi ban saktaa tha
 The second thing is that the British officers used to eat meat of both cow and pig which could not be made in the kitchen of Indian soldiers
 teesri baat unka alag bhojanalay kii bajah yah thi ki kyonki unke khaanaa free nahi tha jabaki sainikon ko rashan bilkul free tha or is vyavastha kii bajah se ki kahin free rashan me se koi adhikari apane liye bhojan kaa prabandh na kar le isaliye ek on duty adhikari ko chhodkar kisi adhikari ko bhartiya rasoi me janaa pratibandhit tha
 In today's conditions, while all the officers and soldiers are Indian, the food system is also Indian and the ration is also Indian and both are absolutely free, so the quantity and quality of food should be the same and the food should be made in one place and Of course, the dining table should be different

 kya aisi vyavastha bhartiya sena mai sambhav he or nahi sambhav ho sakati to kabhi bhi is desh me ekta kii duhai sirf bhaashanbaaji tak hi simat ke yaa phir ghoshnapatron me hi dabakar rah jaayegi
 This is my personal thought and maybe some people may not like this system change
 lekin vyavastha parivartan samay kii jarurat bhi he or is tarah ke parivartan samay samay par hote bhi rahe he
 In this way, a lot of change needs to be done within the country as well, such as the pension system for mps despite having a tenure of five years
 aakhir jab khud sarkaar ne april 2004 se sabhi kendriya va rajya karmchaariyon kii puraani pension vyavastha band kar di to phir yah saansad or bidhayak ko yah pension kis aadhaar par nyyochit tehraaya ja saktaa he
 i want all of us to be willing to raise such issues by giving up personal interest and thinking about the national interest and public interest through this forum, on every platform by becoming a strong man of the people, only then our real objective will be fulfilled

 After some introspection two or four special things emerge which were responsible for all this
 1) samaaj, dharm or rajkaaj karne logon kaa apana uttardaayitv or farz nibhaana or kaam ko naa karnaa or sara dhyaan is baat main laga dena ki kaise puri pranali ko aisa bana de ki bina kuch kiye sari malai unke paas aati rahe or unki aulad chaahe kitni bhi nalayak ho vahi uttaradhikari ho iske liye chaahe unhen kuch bhi karnaa pade or lobh kii sari simaaye paar kar puri pranali par is had tak kaabiz ban janaa ki puri vyavastha hichakanachur ho gayi
 2) Permanent caste system in which there is little freedom to change work
 jaise agar kabhi yuddh hota to bhi keval do pratishat aadmi hi yuddh karte baaki ko koi matlab naa tha
 How will one know whether caste system is the cruellest form of exploitation in a society
 iske kuch aayam hote hai, jaise 1) The first sign is that the upper and lower caste have different places of living, eating, playing and celebrating
 2) nichi jati vaale unchi jati ke samaaroh aadi main unke yahan khaanaa banaayenge, tent lagaayenge, baaja bajaayenge, unki vittiya vyavastha dekhenge magar samaaroh main shaamil nahin ho sakate
 But if in a drunken mood that a high caste person ever asks the worker for a function to have a drink or a meal, he will be praised in the whole society
 3) nichi jati vaale ke paas jimmevaariyon kaa tokara sar pe rakh uske pair chaude rahenge lekin uske paas adhikaar nahin honge
 If he is performing his responsibility in the best possible way, then what is he not taking money for? But if the mistake is made even by mistake, then public abuse can be threatened with gloom
 4) agar kabhi sapariwaar jansamooh ikaitha bhi hua to bhi is baat ko sunishchit kiya jaayegaa ki donon samoohon ke pahunchne, baithne, bartan aadi kii alag vyavastha raakhi jaaegi
 In any social context, the upper caste can threaten anything or nothing, which will have two consequences, at that time he will feel humiliated and humiliated, secondly his confidence will be low forever and in the social context he will find a poor corner and look out Someone will hear something somewhere
 nichi jati vaale se ye ummid kii jaayegi ki wo aata jaataa salaam to thokegaa hi saath main haath hi nahin puraa sharir jodakar khadaa hoga
 5) Even if the upper caste did not know their work, they remained in false faith, which remained a burden for the country and society, whereas it was full of potential with potential
 nichi jati vaala kaabil hote hue bhi hatotsahit hotantr or pranali ke liyekam utpaadak kshamta dharak hi rahaa
 And he was never in convenience but in dilemma about his existence
 6) is sabakaa parinaam ye hua ki hamaare samaaj kaa ek bada hissaa kam upjau or jugad hi karata rahaa or puure desh samaaj or tantra ne uskaa dansh jhela
 So friends, look at this in the context of our country and the current defense services
 kya hamaare adhikarigan laalach kii hadon ko paar nahin kar gayi hai? Are they not highly inefficient, ineffective, corrupt and characterless with no place for invention or innovation when DRDO, HAL, NAL
 DOCKYARD BEL BHEL aadi ko sahi feedbek tak nahin de sakate the or itnaa bada pratibhasampann desh sainik sajo saamaan kaa sabase bada ayatak he
 Due to the new kind of casteism, officers in army units are not forcing their soldiers to shoot
 itane zyadayudhpot or hawaijahaajon or pandubbiyon ke akasmaat nahin ho rahe? Before the overall system collapses, we have to play a catalytic role in saving the country, in establishing an efficient work culture so that India is once again the head of the world

 kuch lokapriy opensorce software nimna hai- 1
 Operating system is software that brings the hardware of a computer and runs a computer
 There are mainly three types of operating systems
 vindos kii tarah ke: yah duniya main sabase zyada lokapriy he Like Unix: There are many types of operating systems, the most popular of these is Linux

 Mac / aus Kind of: The personal computer was started from these and it is the easiest to run

 We will discuss this in detail sometime, but only now that most of the forms of Unix are open source software
 linaks open sorce saftware he or ji

 Solaris is also a Unix-based operating system
 yah pehle san mikro-system kaa malikana saftver tha par janvari 2005 se yah open sorce saftware ho gaya he or CDDL ke andargat prakashit kiya gaya he

 yadi aap vindos main kaam karte hai tathaa linaks par jane kii baat sochate hai to aap open aphis daat aurg, firefox, thanderbard, sanbird or jimp par kaam karke dekhen| When we are talking about open source software, then let us talk about the three acronyms that are used in this regard
 FOSS / FLOSS: free software, open sorce software he par har open sorce software, free software nahin he
 GPL for free software Must be published under license, but open source software can also be published under many other types of licenses
 donon main antar to he par sambandh bhi gaharaa he
 All this has started with free software, so such software is called Free Open Source Software or FOSS for short
 yahaan free shabd kaa arth swatantraaa se he par free shabd kaa arth bina paise ke bhi hota he isaliye free shabd kaa prayog kuch chakkar main daal detaa he
 There are two different words in the French language Gratis which means Libre without money which means freedom, so people often use Free / Libre Open Source Software or FLOSS
 LAMP: open sorce software ke chaar mukhya stambh hai: linuxappachemysqlpython, Perl, PHP ityadi Linux and Apache have already been discussed
 mysql ek data-base prabandh karne kaa program he
 Python, Perl, PHP, etc
 are computer languages for scripting and writing programs
 aane vaala kal ho saktaa he ki isi LAMP se ujjwalit ho isaliye open sorce software ko kinare na kijiye, dhyaan main rakhiye| Linus Torvalds, who is the originator of Linux, has written his biography with David Diamond
 iskaa naam he 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionary’| yah bahut acchhee pustak he tathaa ise padhne se jivan main aage badhane kii prerana milti he vah is pustak main open sorce software ke bare main kehete hai, 'the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest will not be excluded from its development
 


so open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 It’s still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people's rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that does not mandate legal protection for such secrecy
 ' jab ham log baat open software main kuch phaayde ke bare main kar rahe he to bahut acha hoga ki kuch doosraa paksh bhi dekhen| bill gates, vindos ke janmdata hai
 He has written the book 'the Road Ahead'
 yah pustak bhi bahut acchhee he
 According to its name, it tells which side of information technology will go in future
 Many difficult questions are explained very easily in this
 isamen ve free software kii kamiyon ko is tarah se varnan karte hai, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
 ' yah to kahana mushkil he ki software udyog kis taraf jaayegaa parantu duniya ke bahut saare desh tathaa vyapaar gharaane open sorce software ko apana hissaa bana rahe hai
 We are currently at a crossroads and are in a position to give a new twist to information technology

 It is heard that when young Sawai Jaisingh first appeared in the court of Delhi Emperor Aurangzeb, it is not known why Aurangzeb suddenly grabbed both the hands of Jaisingh and asked "now tell me, what will you do?" At this, Jai Singh smiled directly at the lips and said with a very calm voice, "alampanah! We have a tradition of marriage among Hindus
" var, vadhoo kaa ek haath apane haath main lekar is baat kii pratigya karata he ki vah uskaa haath jindagi bhar nahi chhodega, umr bhar uskaa saath nibaahega! aaj badshaah salaamat khud meraa ek haath nahin, mere donon hi haath jab apane haath main le chuke hai, fir mujhe kis baat kii parvaah?" aurangzeb ko is chaturaai bhare jabaab kii ummid na thi, lekin is budhimattapurna haazirajavaabi se vah bahut prasann hua

 From his father's time, the delhi-emperor
 They wanted to call them in the south to take their military service

 jaisingh ne badshaah ko sachet kiya ki unke jane se badshaah kii jaan ko khatra ho jayega lekin yah salaah badshaah kii samaj main nahin ai
 Jaisingh left Delhi on 13 February 1719 AD

 Mohammad Shah, on reaching Delhi, sent Jaisingh an order to come to Delhi, in which he wrote that he has to take advice on many important problems
 usne dilli pahunchane par badshaah ne apane naye var mohammad amin khan ko unke dere par lene bheja
 On coming to the court, the emperor gave him a big welcome and gave many gifts
 unke mansab main 4000 savaar or badha die gaye
 On this occasion, he gave them two crores of rupees in reward / money which he humbly refused to take

 Like Vibhishan, the victory of the fort of Thun looked certain with the advice of Badansingh

 This led to a long and painful struggle between Jaipur and Bundi in Rajasthan

 All were alert, but in the end he returned home from Mathura
 "nadirshah ne jab bharat par hamalaa kiya tab dilli kii sahaytarth jaisingh nahin gaye
 The reason for this was - the Nizam and Qamruddin were in high positions in the empire at that time and they could be suspected to be responsible for Nadirshah's attack, but the Emperor kept believing in them and kept giving them necessary advice
