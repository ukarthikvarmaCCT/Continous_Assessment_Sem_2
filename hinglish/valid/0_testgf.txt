 He was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1961 for his critical editing of poetry of a Ghalib composed by him, dewan-e-ghalib
 hinduon ke pracheenatam uplabdh granth rugveda main purohit kaa varnan he
 It appears that in that period, Purohitya was in the hands of a class expert who used to act as a medium in getting the grace of the gods
 purohit adhiktar brahman hote the
 Many of these kings and wealthy men were appointed to do religious acts
 inhen kaaphi daanadakshina milti thi or usee par inkaa tathaa inke pariwaron kaa nirvaah hota tha
 They also used to help their kings in war-related incidents and they often had knowledge of Vaidyakas also
 rugveda ke dasven khand main aushadhopchaar ke sambandh main mantra milte hai
 Treatment of tuberculosis, sedentary death, childbirth, hostility etc
 is described in these
 vivaah, mritak sanskaar aadi sanskaar karana bhi porohitya ke antargat aata tha
 It is clear from this that in that period the work of the priest started to touch the daily life of man
 baad main yajna, yagadi kaary bhi porohitya main sanmilit hue
 Somayag is described in the Rigveda
 isamen kaaphi sankhya main purohiton kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi
 The priests used to do the work of Hatra, Potra, Prahastu, Adhvaryu etc
 inke alaava kulpurohit kaa bhi varnan miltaa he
 Its task was to perform the king's conduct
 vishesh yajna yagadi ke samay yah kaary bhi karata tha
 Thus we see that in the Vedic period the priest was greatly valued
 vah devataaon kaa poojak hota tha or stuti tathaa bali dwaara yajmaan ke liye devataaon kii krupa praapt karaane kaa praytn karata tha
 a more vivid description is found in the Brahmins regarding purohitya
 brahman sahitya kaa kaal isa purv chhathi shatabdi kaa he
 At this time, the outline of the work of the priest had become very clear and vivid
 bhinn bhinn bhaagon main bhinn bhinn sankhya main purohiton kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi
 The daily Agnihotra required only one Adhvaryu
 agnyadhey tathaa agnidh ke liye adhvaryu ke alaava hotri, maitravarun aadi 16 purohiton kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi
 Among them, Brahma was the most important
 yajyakarya main kahi truti na ho tathaa sampurna yajna vidhipurvak nirvidhn sampann ho iskaa uttardaayitv usee par hota tha
 The importance of the priest increased greatly during the Brahmin period
 ab vah raja ko uske rajkaarya, nyaayaadhikaran ityadi main bhi paraamarsh dene laga
 He also took up the task of suppressing enemies and making the state prosperous
 aitarey brahman ke vivaran se spasht he ki us kaal main raja apane purohit par purna rup se nirbhar rahata tha
 When the gods were defeated in the Dewasur war, it was only Jupiter, the god-priest, who supported him and got the gods Vijayashree
 is samay tak paurohitya anuvanshik ho chalaa tha
 The priest had a higher position than the king
 vahaan bhi jaataa tha vahaan uskaa bahut aadar ke saath swaagat hota tha
 There was no limit to the donations she received
 log yajphikon ko apni sampurna sampatti tak kaa daan kar dete the
 This donation was considered the best
 brahman kii sampatti par raja kaa bhi adhikaar nahin hota tha
 Brahmana was considered to be the greatest patriarch
 uskaa praayshchit keval vaajapeya yajna se hi hota tha
 But the people of deceitful Brahmins did not tolerate
 panchavinsh brahman main ullekh he ki dhokhebaad brahman ko mrityudand diya jaataa tha
 In return for the special place that Brahmin had got in the society, he was expected to have knowledge of virtue, duty and ritual
 isa purv chhathi shatabdi se upanishdakaal prarambh hota he
 By this time the priest's field of work had been clearly determined
 uskaa kaary yaajik kaary se bhinn ho chukaa tha
 Vedadhyayana, Yajna and austerities were replaced by knowledge acquisition and teaching, and in this period the guru-shishya-tradition started becoming stronger
 iske falswaroop tatvagyan tathaa darshan kii bhinn bhinn paramparaayen ek duusare se alag hone lageen or mat matantaron kaa udai hone laga
 Buddhist and Jain religions were established
 in dharmo kii parshvapithika main naastikta hone ke kaaran prarambh main inamen paurohitya ko koi sthaan nahin tha
 But slowly, the rules of conduct and practices started to be made for the people of these religions and they needed different kinds of different but also a special kind of class which could direct the people to perform their duties
 is prakaar inamen bhi paurohitya ne jad pakadana prarambh kar diya
 After this comes the period of the creation of Ramayana, Mahabharatadi poetry
 is samay tak raja purohit par sampurna rup se ashrith ho chukaa tha or uske paraamarsh ke bina koi kaary nahin karata tha
 The priest mentioned in the Puranas and Sanskrit literature was similar to the priest of the modern period
 uskaa kaaryakshetra simit ho chukaa tha
 During this period Paurohitya also included upanayana, vivahadi rites, making village purohitya i
e
 making the coils of the villagers, plowing sowing etc
, taking out agricultural cultivation, being a priest in temples etc
 aadhunik kaal main bhi ham anek mandiron main purohiton ko pujari ke rup main pratishthit dekhte hai
 In Sikh Gurdwaras we see the Granthi
 ye bhi ek prakaar se purohit hi hai
 In the modern period, the importance of Yajna Yagadi has reduced very little
 yajphikon kaa varg samaptpraaya he
 Therefore, in Purohitya, now in place of Vedic Yajnadi, religious festivals like idolatry, Makarsankranti, Vasantpanchami, Holi, Deepawali etc
 have gained entry

 Their information can be done through Srotasutra, Grihyasutra and Shulbasutra Prabhriti texts

 The law of sacraments also follows the homely sources

 dhire-dhire upniveshvaadi agrahon ke tahat europe or europee saanskrithik purvadharanaon ko swaabhaavik, naiysargik or saarvbhaum maan kar unheen ke aadhaar par baaki duniya kii vyakhya or vishleshan karne ke ravaiye ke rup main 'europe- centric' drushtikon ubhara
 After World War II in the twentieth century, critics of capitalism and imperialism began to see Eurocentricity as an ideology
 sattar ke dashak se pehle oxuard dictionari main yah shabd nahin miltaa tha
 But the Marxist writings of Sameer Amin in the eighties transformed it into a frequently used concept in the intellectual world
 vidmbana yah he ki marxvaadi vidwaanon dwaara gadha gaya yah pad marks ke lekhan kii aalochana karne ke liye bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 There is no dearth of those who claim Marx as Eurocentric
 haalaanki marks ke lekhan main europee shreshthata kaa sahjaat aagrah talash karnaa mushkil he, par aalochakon kaa kahana he ki vishwa-itihaas kii unki samaj europee anubhav ke aadhaar par hi bani thi or ve maanavtaa ke bhavishya ko samgr rup se europee model ke aaine main hi dekhte the
 Since 1851, the placing of Greenwich, London at the center of the longitude meridian of maps of the world, is a fact of Eurocentricity that has been shaken by the whole world without any cultural objection
 uttar-aupniveshik adhyayan ke tahat eurokendriyata kaa ek ullekhneey udhaaharan maraketer atlas ko mana jaataa he
 In this atlas, the temperate zone of Europe is shown to be much larger in size than other regions
 is atlas main vishwa kaa maanchitr vibhinn mahadwipon ko pradarshit karne vaali vastunishth rekhaon se hi chitrit nahin he
 The space in the map is ideologically embodied and with the help of text and other illustrations provided with the map
 parinamswaroop yah nakshaa europe ko vishwa ke sthanik or saanskrithik taatparyon ke centre main sthapit kar detaa he
 Edward Saeed's work 'orientalism' examines Eurocentricity closely
 said kaa kahana he ki yah vichaar na keval anya samskritiyon ko prabhavit karke unhen apane jaisaa banane kii taraf dhakelta he, balki unhen apane anubhav ke daayre main ek khaas mukaam par rakhane ke zariye un par pashchim kaa prabhutv thope detaa he
 According to Saeed, since enlightenment, European culture has developed a systemic discipline through which it forms and manages to manage the former world
 eurokendriyata sahitya-adhyayan, itihaas-lekhan or maanavshaastra ke anushaasan ke madhyam se bhi pusht hui he
 In the field of literature, its advocates cleverly undertook the project of establishing their conceptions as universal of literature
 itihaas main vijetaon ke drushtikon se lekhan kiya gaya
 Eurocentricity infiltrated the anthropological world as an autocratic insistence and called non-european cultures 'primitive' against European civilizational standards
 kuch samskruti-samikshakon kii to manyata he ki agar eurokendriya vichaar pehle se sthapit na hota to maanavshaastra ke shuruaati roopon kaa upniveshwaad ke saath itnaa ghanishtha rishta sthapit hi na ho paata
 There is also a tendency to confirm Eurocentricity in the educational activities undertaken by missionaries for the promotion of Christianity
 inhen sab kaarnon se gair-europee samaajon ne aadhunikeekaran kii prakriya main eurokendriyata ko itnaa jazb kar liya he ki pashchim se aane vaali har chiz yaa kriti ko shreshth maanane kaa vichaar vigyaan, udyog, ganit, kala, manoranjan or samskruti jaise sabhi mahatvapurn kshetron par lagbhag sthai rup se haaavee ho chukaa he
 Even people who are alert to Eurocentricity are eventually found to be in harmony with it
 aitihaasik drushti se dekhen to europee shreshthata kaa vichaar pandrahavin sadi main europee samrajyavad ke saath-saath sudrudh hua
 The scientific revolution, the commercial revolution and the expansion of colonial empires expressed themselves as the rise of the modern era
 ise 'european chamatkaar' kaa daur mana jaataa he jisase pehle europe aarthik or praudyogic drushti se turki kii automan kilaafat, bharat ke mogul samrajya or china ke ming samrajya ke mukaable nahin thahar saktaa tha
 The concept reached its zenith with the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and the second wave of European colonization
 europee takatein duniya main vyapaar or raajnneeti par chaa gayin
 Those who had developed rapidly on the basis of progressivism and industrialism, those who considered the European civilization to be the universal center of the world, gave scornful discourse to the societies based on hunting, farming and animal husbandry
 attharahavin sadi main hi europee lekhakon ko europe or duniya ke duusare mahadwipon kii tulana main yah kehete hue paaya ja saktaa tha ki europe bhugolic kshetrafal main dusron se chota zarur he, par vibhinn kaarnon se uski sthiti khaas tarah kii he
 This particular situation was then defined by arguing for his mastery in European customs, courtesy, science and art
 eurokendriyata ke bare main ek sawaal yah bhi uthaaya jaataa he ki kya yah pravriti duniya ke anya bhaagon main paye jane vaale swajatvaad kii hi ek kism nahin he? chiniyon or japaniyon main bhi saanskrithik shreshthata kaa dambh he
 The contests of the 'american Century' are also a model of autism
 lekin eurokendriyata ko jaise hi upniveshwaad ke pariprekshya main rakh kar dekha jaataa he, vaise hi yah vichaar saamaanya swajatvaad se alag ek vishisht sanrachana kii tarah dikhaai dene lagata he
 Decay in the credibility of Eurocentricism also began with the vigor of anti-colonial movements and the epoch-making process of de-colonization that followed the Second World War
 azaadi ke andolanon dwaara kiye sthaneey paramparaon or mulyon ke rashtravaadi daavon ne pashchimi saanskrithik aham ko chunauti di
 New history was created in the central and southern parts of India and the American continent with the same purpose and new cultural identities were created
 eurokendriyata ke barakes vishwa-sabhyataa kii bahukendriya tasveeron main rang bhare gayi
 The worldwide prestige of the ideas of Eastern personalities like Ravindra Nath Thakur and the civilized criticism of Gandhi-provided West also played a significant role in pushing Eurocentricity off the stage

 Logon got a lot of work done

 For this reason, Logon started stage management
 manch prabandhak ko achche plener or organiser hona padt he
 Although many famous people may work with stage managers, the work itself is not only glamorous, often involving long hours and quite boring, repetitive tasks as well as being physically demanding
 reharsal avadhi ke dauraan manch prabandhan dal kalatmak prakriya ke bich purvaabhyas kamare main vikaas ke rup main kaary karata he or logon ko shaareerik rup se nirmaan, silaai, sangyojan or he ki purvaabhyas kamare ke baahar utpaadan kar rahi he

 Different management of different shoes takes place in stage management

 Metaphor or feature is a narrative article that appeals to people, which is not related to recent news but focuses on a particular person, place, or event
 vistaar kii drushti se roopak main bahut gaharaai hoti he
 Today, feature writing and its presentation have become extremely important in modern journalism
 samachar agar patrakarita kii ridh he to feechar patrakarita kaa soundarya badhaane vaali shakti
 News in journalism, where there is a precise record of the immediate events, then the metaphor means that apart from the immediate form of the feature news, its detail, its graphical presentation or the details of the whole events related to it
 aadhunik patrakarita main ab sthanbhav ke kaaran samachar lekhan main shabdon kii seemaa tay kar di gai he or patrkaar ko usee shabd seemaa main sab kuch kahana hota he
 In this case, the feature acts as a facilitator for the journalist
 feechar main graphics, chitron, rekhachitron or sankshipt prastutikaran ke jariye bahut chote sthaan main bahut kuch kaha, likhaa yaa prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 The metaphor has evolved from descriptive works, but due to the limitation of words and space, the features are also becoming narrower
 haalaanki sankshipt hone ke baavjood feechar kaa mahatv kam nahin hua he balki or adhik bad gaya he
 The expansion of the news in the feature itself is presented with a special technique
 iske liye feechar lekhak ko yah pataa karnaa hota he ki samachar kaa mukhya vishay yaa mukhya paatr koun he? samachar ke mukhya vishay ke saath jude pramukh tatv kya hai? le khak ko is sabkon prastut karte samay usamen vyaktigat sparsh bhi dena hota he
 Features presented in an entertaining way along with a touch of human emotion are more popular because they provide information about the entire elements of the subject as well as entertain the reader, listener or viewer
 samachar tathyon kaa vivaran tathaa vichaar dekar khatm ho jaataa he jabaki feechar main ghatana athwa vishay ke parivesh, vividh pakshon tathaa uske prabhaavon kaa varnan hota he
 The news does not reflect the writer's thoughts or his personality, while the feature reflects the writer's ideology, his imagination as well as his personality
 feechar main katha tatv kii pradhanta rahati he yani uske lekhan yaa prastuti main saralata or pravaah donon hi hote hai
 But the feature is not merely a story
 feechar kalpanajagat kii baton main kho jane ke bajaay vishay kii gaharaai main jaakar pathakon kii jigyaasa ko shant karne kaa kaam karata he
 Feature writing is an artistic work and for any journalist to become a good feature writer - feechar samaacharon ke prastutikaran kii hi ek vidha he lekin samachar kii tulana main feechar main gahan adhyayan, chitron, shodh or saakshaatkaar adike jariye vishay kii vyakhya hoti he
 He has a detailed presentation and all this happens in such a smooth and interesting way that the reader keeps getting caught up in his flow
 patrakarita or sahitya ke vidwaanon ne roopak kii alag-alag paribhaashaayen gadhi hai
 By one definition, ek anya paribhaasha ke anusaar, In another definition, the feature has been called the 'soul of the newspaper'
 saamaanya shabdon main kahen to samachar kaa kaam tatthy or vichaar dekar khatm ho jaataa he
 Whereas feature work goes beyond this
 yah samachar kii prishthbhumi kaa khulaasa karte hai, vishay yaa ghatana ke janm or vikaas kaa vivaran dete hai
 They also reveal the subject or event in full detail and make the reader think
 ek achche feechar kii sarthakata isi baat main he ki vah apane pathakon ke man mashtishk par kitna prabhaav daalati he
 The feature writer also informs the reader about his reaction or idea about the event or topic and thus affects the reader's imaginations and his conceptual mindset
 feechar kaa mahatv isi baat main he ki yah kab, kyon, kaise, kahaan or koun ko spasht karne vaale samachar yani news se aage jaakar tatthy kalpana or vichaar kii santulit prastuti ke jariye apana ek vishesh prabhaav chodta he
 One of the features of the feature is that it satisfies the curiosity of the reader after reading any news
 aajkal samachar patron main ficharon kaa upyog dinondin badhata ja rahaa he
 There may be a locality in Indian linguistic newspapers for detailed news on the tremendous winter and snowfall in Europe
 lekin isi vishay ko mahaj ek choti si jagah main ek sachitr feechar ke jariye prastut kar akhbaar apane sthanbhav kii samasya se bhi ubar sakate hai or pathak ko barf se jame europe ke bare main sampoorn jaankaree bhi mil jaati he
 Similarly, along with the news of a local accident, if the details of other such incidents, preventive measures, experiences of the affected, etc
 are presented as an illustrated feature, then the reader gets all the information together
 feechar ke is upyog ne aaj feechar ke mahatvako atyadhik badha diya he
 Due to this growing importance, feature writing has also become an important genre of journalism
 isi ke saath feechar lekhakon kaa mahatv bhi badhata ja rahaa he
 Today, the importance of feature desks in newspapers has also increased and their utility
 samachar patron main ab feechar ke kaaran behatar prastutikaran or taatkalikta par adhik dhyaan diya jane laga he
 Many large newspaper groups have now started centralized feature writing system, under which features on important subjects are prepared and sent for all editions of the newspaper
 internet or soochna takanic ke chamatkaaron ne aaj feechar lekhan ko aasaan bana diya he
 But due to these miracles, new challenges have also arisen in the field of feature writing today
 aaj feechar lekhak ko is cheez par sarvaadhik dhyaan dena padataa he ki uske feechar main saare tatthy ekadam sahi hon, taaje hon, samichin hon or ve pathak kii sari jigyaasaaon kaa samaadhaan bhi kar saken
 Feature is a genre of journalism in which writing cannot be tied to a particular range of rules
 viksit deshon main patrakarita kii ek vidha ke rup main feechar lekhan bahut lokapriy he
 Since journalism was born and developed in India with politics, the feature's development journey here started relatively late
 yahan praarambhik patrakarita main kalam kaa upyog talwaar ke rup main kiya gaya
 In the post-independence years, and especially in the post-emergency years, newspapers had stepped up the task of exploring the larger dimensions of life beyond politics and understanding life in its entirety
 isi ke chalate hamaare desh main feechar lekhan kii ek vishisht style viksit hui
 The revolutionary changes in printing technology have doubled the utility, need and importance of feature writing
 feechar rachana kaa mukhya niyam yah he ki feechar aakarshak, tatthyatmakaur manoranjak hona chahie
 Currently, there is no longer any kind of layout, decoration, shape-type or word limit for the feature
 aaj kam se kam shabdon main feechar rachana ko adhik mahatvapurn mana jane laga he
 In the same way, instead of one big work on one subject, features are also being written by presenting many small information and materials simultaneously
 mote taur par feechar lekhan ke liye 5 mukhya baton kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he- Feature writing is also an art and now that the features of the feature are changing, the technique and methods of feature writing are also changing
 vartmaan main feechar apni paramparaagat shaileyon or paribhaashaon kii seemaa tod kar nae-nae rup badalte ja rahe hai

 The Battle of Tarain or the Battle of Taravadi is a series of wars that opened up the whole of North India to Muslim control
 ye yuddh mohammad gauri or ajmer tathaa dilli ke chouhan rajput shaasha prithvi raaj tritiy ke bich huye
 The war zone was between Karnal and Thaneshwar in Karnal district of the present state of Haryana, India, which is located 113 km north of Delhi
 mohammad gori ne 1186 main gaznavi vansh ke antim shaasha se lahore kii gaddi chin lee or vah bharat ke hindu kshetron main pravesh kii taiyaari karne laga
 In 1191, he was led by a mixed army of Rajputs led by Prithvi Raj III, who was also supported by King Jayachand of Kannauj and Banaras present-day Varanasi
 apane samrajya ke vistaar or suvyavastha par prithviraj chouhan kii paini drushti hameshaa jami rahati thi
 Now he wanted to expand to Punjab
 kintu us samay punjab par mohammad gauri kaa raaj tha
 By 1190 AD, the whole of Punjab was occupied by Muhammad Ghori
 ab vah bhatinda se apana rajkaaj chalata tha
 Prithviraj knew very well that it was impossible to establish the Chauhan Empire in Punjab without fighting Mohammad Ghauri
 yahi vichaar kar usne gauri se nipatane kaa nirnay liya
 To materialize this decision, Prithviraj left for Punjab with a huge army
 teevr kaarywahi karte hue usne haansi, saraswati or sarhind ke kilon par apana adhikaar kar liya
 Meanwhile, he received information that the rebels in Anheelwada had revolted against him
 punjab se vah anhilwara kii or chal pade
 Gauri attacked behind them and took the fort of Sirhind again
 prithviraj ne sheeghra hi anhilwara ke vidroh ko kuchal diya
 Now he decided to wage a decisive battle with Gauri
 usne apni sena ko nae dhang se susajjit kiya or yuddh ke liye chal diya
 There was a fierce battle in the army of Khet Singh Khangar, the commander of Prithviraj on the banks of river Ravi, but nothing came out
 yah dekh kar prithviraj gauri ko sabak sikhaane ke liye aage badha
 The battle was fought at a place called Tarain, 14 miles from Thaneshwar and near the fort of Sirhind
 tarin ke is pehle yuddh main rajputon ne gauri kii sena ke chakke chhudaa die
 Gauri's soldiers started saving life
 jo bhaag gaya uske praan batch gaye, kintu jo saamne aayaa use gaajar-muuli kii tarah kaat daalaa gaya
 Sultan Muhammad Ghori was badly wounded in the war
 apane unche turki ghode se vah ghayal avasthaa main girane hi vaala tha kii yuddh kar rahe ek uske sainik kii drushti us par padi
 He quickly took command of Sultan's horse and jumped on Gauri's horse and took the wounded Gauri out of the battlefield
 netritvviheen sultan kii sena main khalabali much chuki thi
 Ottoman soldiers ran in front of Rajput army
 prithviraj kii sena ne 80 mile tak in bhaagate turkon kaa peechha kiya
 But the Ottoman army did not dare to return
 is vijay se prithviraj chouhan ko 7 karod rupee kii dhan smapda praapt hui
 He shared this wealth with his brave soldiers
 is vijay se sampoorn bharatvarsh main prithviraj kii dhak jam gayi or unki veerta, dhirta or saahas kii kahani sunai jane lagi
 King Jayachand was badly hurt by Prithviraj Chauhan's deportation of Princess Sanyogita in this way
 uske hriday main apmaan ke tikhe tir se chubh rahe the
 He wanted the demolition of Prithviraj at any cost
 bhale hi use kuch bhi karnaa pade
 He came to know from reliable sources that Mohammad Ghauri wants to avenge his defeat with Prithviraj
 bas phir kya tha jayachand ko maano apane man kii muraad mil gayi
 He decided to kill Prithviraj by assisting Gauri
 jayachand akele prithviraj se yuddh karne kaa saahas nahin kar saktaa tha
 He thought that in this way Prithviraj will also end and the kingdom of Delhi will be given to him as a reward

 After getting the help of the traitor Jayachand, Gauri immediately agreed to take revenge on Prithviraj
 jab prithviraj ko ye soochna mili kii gauri ek baar phir yuddh kii taiyaariyon main juta hua to un par koi prabhaav nahin padaa

 The injured elephant could neither move forward nor backwards, but they started to flaunt their own army in fear

 But he could not forget Sujan and continued to compose poetry using Sujan's name in his compositions

 inaki rachana abhidha ke vachya rup main kam, lakshana ke lakshya or vyanjana ke vyangy rup main adhik he
 He was also linguistic and Vrajbhaspraveen
 inhone vrajabhasha ke prayogon ke aadhaar par nutan vagyog sanghatit kiya he
 His works express a very serious, serene, impassioned and distraught sublime form of love, which is why Ghanananda has been called 'sakshat Rasamurti'

 'paradox' is Ghanananda's favorite alankar
 acharya vishwanath ne unke bare main likhaa he- From the point of view of verses, Ghanananda has written more poetry and more
 vaise unhone dohe or chaoupaaiyaan bhi likhi hai
 Ghanananda's poetry is primarily the adornment of rasa in terms of juice

 Sujan's love forms and verses etc
 are described in these posts
 ghanaanand nayika sujan kaa varnan atyant ruchipurvak karaten hai

 The poet also criticizes his beloved for showing extreme cleverness
 kavi apni priya ko prem patr bhi bhijwata he par us nishthur ne use padhakar dekha tak nahin
 The poet Ghanananda has no match in describing the beauty of form
 vah kaali sari main apni nayika ko dekhakar unmatta sa ho jaate hai
 Savari saree has made Suzanne's white body look so amazing
 ghanaanand ke kavy kii ek pramukh visheshta he- bhav pravanta ke anuroop abhivyakti kii swaabhaavik vakrata
 Ghanananda's love is seen rising above the earth in the sense of cosmic love and touching the heights of supernatural love, then the poet's priyajujan becomes the form of parabrahma
 aisi dasha main ghanaanand prem se upar uth kar bhakt ban jate hai
 Beyond the period around many days, Khare Arbarni is full of life

 In the year 1975, on the occasion of the 2500th Nirvana year of 1008 Lord Mahavir Swamiji, all the Jain communities agreed on it by making a form of symbol of Jainism
 aajkal lagbhag sabhi jain patr-patrikaon, vaivaahik card, kshamavani card, bhagwaan mahavir swami kaa nirvana diwas, deepawali aamantran-patr evam anya kaaryakramon kii patrikaon main is pratik chihn kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
