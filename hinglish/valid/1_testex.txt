 Economics is the branch of social science under which the production, distribution, exchange and consumption of goods and services are studied
 'arthshaastra' shabd sanskrit shabdon arth or shaastra kii sandhi se bana he, jiskaa shabdic arth he - 'dhan kaa adhyayan'
 The systematic knowledge of human actions in relation to a subject is called the scripture of that subject, so in economics it is necessary to have systematic knowledge of the work related to human beings
 arthshaastra kaa prayog yah samajhane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he ki arthvyavastha kis tarah se kaary karti he or samaaj main vibhinn virgon kaa aarthik sambandh kaisaa he
 Economical analysis is used in various fields related to society, such as: crime, education, family, health, law, politics, religion, social institutions and war etc
 pro
 samulson ke anusaar, The British economist Alfred Marshall defines the subject as 'a study of everyday life of mankind'
 marshall ne paaya tha ki samaaj main jo kuch bhi ghat rahaa he, uske peeche aarthik shaktiyaan hua karti hai
 That is why we need to understand its economic basis in order to understand the society and make it better
 leonnelle robinson ke anusaar aadhunik arthshaastra kii paribhaasha is prakaar he- Rarity means that the available resources are unable to meet all the demands and needs
 durlabhta or sansadhano ke vaikalpik upyogon ke kaaran hi arthshaastra kii praasangikta he
 Hence this topic studies options under the influence of motivators and resources
 arthshaastra main arthsambandhi baton kii pradhanta hona swaabhaavik he
 But we should not forget that the purpose of knowledge is not only to gain meaning, it is also to achieve welfare, happiness and peace for the world by searching for truth
 arthshaastra yah bhi batalaata he ki manushyon ke aarthik prayatnon dwaara vishwa main sukh or shanti kaise praapt ho sakati he
 Like all the scriptures, the aim of economics is also world welfare
 arthshaastra kaa drushtikon antarrashtriya he, yadhyapi usamen vyaktigat or rashtriya hiton kaa bhi vivechan rahata he
 It is possible that some people or nations become rich after studying this scripture and start exploiting other people or nations in the worry of becoming more rich, which disrupts the peace of the world
 parantu unke shoshan sambandhi ye sab kaary arthshaastra ke anuroop yaa uchit nahin kahe ja sakate, kyonki arthshaastra to unheen kaaryon kaa samarthan kar saktaa he, jiske dwaara vishwakalyaan kii vruddhi ho
 It is clear from this discussion that the simple definition of economics should be as follows - In economics, all the work related to the meaning of municipals is ordered in a systematic way
 uskaa dhyey vishwakalyaan he or uskaa drushtikon antarrashtriya he
 In which money related verbs are studied, it is called Arthashastra
 arthshaastra kii vishay-saamagree kaa sanket isaki paribhaasha se miltaa he
 Arthashatra is the science that studies the relationship between the natural alternative means of human use and their use
 arthshaastra kaa saiddhanthik evam vyavhaarik mahatv he
 The first book written on economics is Kautilya's Arthashastra
 arthshaastra bahut pracheen vidya he
 Four Upvedas were built in very ancient times
 in chaaron upavedon main arthved bhi ek upved mana jaataa he, parantu ab yah uplabdh nahin he
 Economics is also enumerated in the Vishnu Purana in the ancient and ancient 18 disciplines of India
 is samay barhospaty tathaa kautilia arthshaastra uplabdh hai
 Jupiter was the first Acharya of economics
 unka arthshaastra sutron ke rup main praapt he, parantu usamen arthshaastra sambandhi sab baton kaa samavesh nahin he
 Kautilya's Arthashastra is the only treatise available on the subject of Arthashastra, hence its importance is the highest
 acharya kautilya, chanakya ke naam se bhi prasiddh hai
 He was the general secretary of Chandragupta Maurya
 inkaa granth 'arthshaastra' panditon kii raay main praaia: 2,300 varsh purana he
 According to Acharya Kautilya, the field of economics is to think of ways to obtain and protect the Earth
 unhone apane arthshaastra main brahmacharya kii diksha se lekar deshon kii vijay karne kii anek baton kaa samavesh kiya he
 Acharya Kautilya discusses in detail the things of colonization of cities, management of detectives, creation of army, establishment of courts, marriage rules, rules, methods of climbing the sutras, fortifications, differences of treaties, architecture, etc
 pramant: is granth kii kitni hi baaten arthshaastra ke aadhunik kaal main nirdisht kshetra se baahar kii hai
 In it, topics like politics, criminology, sociology, ethics etc
 have also been considered
 bhartiya samskruti main chaar purushaarthon main arth bhi sammilit he
 Aparigraha is preached in Jainism
 anek pracheen sanskrit granthon main dhan kii prashansha yaa ninda kii gayi he
 Bhartrihari has said, 'survey multiplied Kanchanam Ashrayante'
 chanakyasutra main kaha he- Economics developed in its present form in Western countries
 adam smith vartmaan arthshaastra ke janmdata maane jate hai
 You wrote a book called 'wealth of Nations'
 yah san 1776 i
 main prakashit hua
 In this, he has stated that the objective of economics of every country is to increase the wealth and power of that country
 unke baad malths, ricardo, mil, jevans, kaal marks, sithvik, marshall, vaakar, tasig ore robins ne arthshaastra sambandhi vishyon par sundar rachanaayen kin
 But Professor Marshall owes a certain amount to the economics, although Professor Robbins differs from Professor Marshall in the area of economics
 paashchaatya arthshaastriyon main arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main teen dal nishchit rup se dikhaai padate hai
 The first team is of Professor Robbins, who does not accept economics as a science, to consider such things in economics as a guide to economic reforms
 doosraa dal profesar marshall, profesar pigu ityadi kaa he, jo arthshaastra ko vigyaan maanate hue bhi yah sweekaar karata he ki arthshaastra ke adhyayan kaa mukhya vishay manushya he or uski aarthik unnati ke liye jin jin baton kii aavashyaktaa he, un sabakaa vichaar arthshaastra main kiya janaa aavashyak he
 But the economists of this party want to separate economics from politics
 teesraa dal karl marks ke samaan samaajwaadiyon kaa he, jo manushya ke shram ko hi utpati kaa saadhan maanata he or puunjipatiyon tathaa jameendaaron kaa naash karke mazdooron kii unnati chahta he
 He also wants the rule of workers
 teenon dalon main arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main bahut matbhed he
 Therefore it is necessary to consider this question: dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad america or soviet sangh main sheet yuddh chhid gaya
 This was not a war, but the world was divided into two parts
 sheet yuddh ke dauraan america, england, germany, austrailia, france, canada, spain ek taraf the
 All these countries were democratic and the policy of open economy was adopted here
 logon ko vyapaar karne kii khuli chhot thi
 There was an exemption for investing in the stock market
 in deshon main bahut sari bady-bady companiyaan baniin
 There was new research in these companies
 vishvavidhyalay, soochna praudyogiki, enginiyari udyog, bank aadi sabhi kshetron main jamkar tarakkee hui
 All these countries accepted the policy of promoting trade from other countries
 1945 ke baad se in sabhi deshon ne khub tarakkee kii
 On the other hand there were many more countries including Russia, China, Myanmar, East Germany, where the economic policy of socialism was adopted
 yahan par adhikansh udyogon par kadaa sarkari niyantran hota tha
 The government had the right over the profits from the industries
 saamanytah ye desh duusare loktantric deshon ke saath bahut kam vyapaar karte the
 Due to this kind of economic policy, there was not much competition in the industries here
 aam logon ko bhi laabh kamaane ke liye koi protsaahan nahin tha
 Due to these reasons, economic growth in these countries was very less
 3 oktober-1990 ko purv germany or pashchim germany kaa vilay hua
 United Germany, like progressive West Germany, adopted an open economy and democracy
 iske baad 1991 main soviet rus kaa vikhandan hua or rus sahit 15 deshon kaa janm hua
 Russia too adopted an open economy excluding socialism
 china ne samaajwaad ko puri tarah to nahin choda par 1970 ke ant se udaar nitiyon ko apanaaya or agle 3 varshon main bahut unnati kii
 Czechoslovakia was also a socialist country
 1-janvari-1993 ko iskaa check republic or slovakia main vikhandan hua
 These countries also abandoned socialism and adopted democracy and open economy
 mulya kii avadharana arthshaastra main kendriya he
 One way of measuring this is the market price of the commodity
 adam smith ne shram ko mulya ke mukhya shrot ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 The "labor theory of value" has been proposed by many economists, including Karl Marx
 is siddhanth ke anusaar kisi seva yaa vastu kaa mulya uske utpaadan main prayukt shram ke baraabar hot he
 Most people believe that its value determines the price of the commodity
 daam kaa yah shram siddhanth "mulya ke utpaadan laagat siddhanth" se nikatataa se judaa hua he
 Demand, interpretation and forecasting of the price and quantity of goods sold in a fully competitive market are done with the help of demand supply
 yah arthshaastra ke sabase mulbhoot prarupon main se ek he
 It is used extensively for the development of large theories and formats respectively
 maang, kisi niyat avadhi main kisi utpaada kii vah maatra he, jise niyat daam par upabhokta khareednaa chahta he or kharidne main sakasham he
 Demand is usually displayed in the form of a table or graph showing the relationship between price and desired quantity
 aapurti vastu kii vah maatra he jise niyat samay main diye gayi daam par utpaadak yaa vikreta bazaar main bechney ke liye taiyaar he
 Supplies are usually displayed in the form of a table or graph showing the relationship between price and quantity of supply
 pro robins ke anusaar arthshaastra vah vigyaan he jo manushya ke un kaaryon kaa adhyayan karata he jo icchit vastu or uske parimit sadhano ke rup main upasthit hote hai, jinka upyog vaikalpik yaa kam se kam do prakaar se kiya jaataa he
 The following things are clear from this definition of economics - manushya apni ichchhaaon kii tripti se sukh kaa anubhav karata he
 Therefore every human wants to satisfy his desires
 ichchhaaon kii tripti ke liye uske paas jo saadhan, dravya ityadi hai ve parimit hai
 No matter how rich a person is, the amount of his money must remain finite; Then he can use this finite instrument material in many ways
 isliye upyukt paribhaasha ke anusaar arthshaastra main manushyon ke un sab kaaryo ke sambandh main vichaar kiya jaataa he jo vah parimit sadhano dwaara apni ichchhaaon ko trupt karne ke liye karata he
 In this way, it becomes necessary to discuss all the functions related to its consumption in economics
 isi prakaar manushya ko bazaar main anek vastuen kis prakaar kharidne kaa saadhan dravya parimit rahata he
 Through this finite instrument, how he buys his essentials, which item he buys or sells at what rate, at what rate, that is, how he regulates, all these things are considered in economics
 manushya jab koi vastu taiyaar karata he, iske taiyaar karne ke saadhan parimit rahete hai or un sadhano kaa upyog vah kai tarah se kar saktaa he
 Therefore, it is natural to interpret all the work related to origins in economics
 manushya ko apane samay kaa upyog karne kii anek icchaayen hoti hai
 But time is always finite and can be used in many ways
 maan lijie, koi manushya so rahaa he, puja kar rahaa he yaa koi khel khel rahaa he
 According to Professor Rabin's definition, these works should be interpreted in economics, because the time spent in gold in worship or in sports could have been spent in any other work
 manushya koi bhi kaam kare, usamen samay kii aavashyaktaa avashya padati he or is parimit saadhan samay ke upyog kaa vivechan arthshaastra main avashya hona chahie
 Professor Robbins's definition of economics is so broad that according to it, the interpretation of every work of man, whether it is religious, political or social, falls within economics
 is paribhaasha ko maan lene se arthshaastra, raajnneeti, dharamshastra or samajashaastra kii simaaon kaa spashtikaran baraabar nahin ho paata he
 The followers of Professor Robbins hold that according to finite means every aspect of human work has its economic aspect and this aspect is considered in economics
 ve kehete hai, yadi kisi kaary kaa sambandh rajya se ho to uskaa us pahalu se vichaar raajnneetishastra main kiya jaae or yadi us kaary kaa sambandh dharm se bhi ho to us pahalu se unka vichaar dharamshastra main kiya jaae
 Suppose a man is selling a commodity at a much higher price in Chorbazar
 saadhan parimit hone ke kaaran vah jo kaary kar rahaa he or uskaa prabhaav vastu kii utpati yaa purti par kya pad rahaa he, iskaa vichaar to arthshaastra main hoga; chorbazari karanevaale ke sambandh main rajya kaa kya kartavya he, iskaa vichaar raajnneetishastra yaa dandniti main hoga
 Whether this work is good or bad, it will be considered in sociology, ethics or theology
 or, yah kaise roka ja saktaa he, iskaa vichaar shaayad kisi bhi shaastra main na ho
 It is worth considering how far it is appropriate to consider any work from only one aspect
 profesar robins kii arthshaastra kii paribhaasha kii duusari dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki vah arthshaastra ko keval vigyaan kii maanata he
 It contains only the rules that explain the relation of work reason at any given time
 paristhitiyon main kis prakaar ke parivartan hone chahie or paristhitiyon ke badalane ke kya tareeke hai, in gambhir prashnon par usamen vichaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki ye sab kaary vigyaan ke baahar hai
 Suppose, at some point of time, the number of people drinking alcohol in a country is increasing
 professor robins kii paribhaasha ke anusaar arthshaastra main keval yahi vichaar kiya jayega ki sharaab pinevaalon kii sankhya badhane se sharaab kii keemat, sharaab paidaa karanevaalon or swayan sharaabiyon par kya asar padegaa
 But in his economics there is no scope to consider the question whether drinking alcohol is good or bad and how can the habit of drinking alcohol be stopped by the government
 unke arthshaastra main maargdarshan kaa abhaav he
 Guidance is considered to be an important part of every scripture and this part is lacking in Professor Rabin's definition of economics
 is kami ke kaaran arthshaastra kaa adhyayan janata ke liye laabhakaari nahin ho saktaa
 Socialists want that capitalists and landlords do not exist, the government should be laborers and the government should have complete control over the economic condition of the country
 ve apni arthshaastra sambandhi pustakon main in prashnon par bhi vichaar karte hai ki majdoor sarkaar kis prakaar sthapit honi chahie
 How to eradicate the existence of landlords and capitalists
 majdoor sarkaar kaa sagathan kis prakaar kaa ho or unka sanghathan sansarvyapee kis prakaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way, socialist writers make the field of economics so broad that many things of political science come into it
 hamako arthshaastra kaa kshetra is prakaar nirdhaarit karnaa chahie jisase usamen raajnneetishastra yaa anya kisi shaastra kii baton kaa samavesh na hone paae
 In relation to the field of economics, it is also necessary to consider Professor Marshall's definition of economics
 professor marshall ke matanusaar arthshaastra manushya ke jivan sambandhi saadhaaran kaaryon kaa adhyayan karata he
 He examines the personal and social functions of humans, which are closely related to acquiring and using physical means for their welfare
 professor marshall ne munashya ke kalyaan ko arthshaastra kii paribhaasha main sthaan dekar arthshaastra ke kshetra ko kuch badha diya he
 But even this economist did not give any thought in his book regarding the goal of economics
 vartmaan kaal main paashchaatya arthshaastriyon ne arthshaastra kaa kshetra to badha diya he, parantu aaj bhi ve arthshaastra ke dhyey ke sambandh main vichaar karnaa arthshaastra ke kshetra ke adanr sweekaar nahin karte
 Now economics is being given the form of art
 sansar main sarvatra aarthik yojanaon kii charchaa he
 Formulating an economic plan is an art
 bina dhyey ke koi yojana taiyaar hi nahin kii ja sakati
 There is no single objective of those who formulate these plans, because economics do not have any definite goal
 prayek yojana kaa ek alag hi dhyey maan liya jaataa he
 Now ways of improving the condition of countrymen are also considered in economics, but the ultimate goal of improving this condition has not been decided yet
 sarvamaanya dhyey ke abhaav main arthshaastriyon main matbhinnata itani bad gai he ki kisi vishay par do arthshaastriyon kaa ek mat kathinata se ho paata he
 This divergence has created a major hurdle in the study of economics
 is baadha ko dur karne ke liye paashchaatya arthshaastriyon ko apane granthon main arthshaastra ke dhyey ke sambandh main gambhirthapurvak vichaar karnaa chahie or jahaan tak sambhav ho, arthshaastra kaa ek sarvamaanya dhyey sheeghra nishchit kar lenaa chahie
 Everyone in the world wants to be happier and avoid sorrow
 vah jaanata he ki apni ichha jab trupt hoti he tab sukh praapt hota he or jab ichha kii purti nahin hoti tab du:kha kaa anubhav hota he
 Money helps in getting the desired item
 isliye prayek vyakti dhan praapt karne kaa praytn karata he
 He understands that happiness is achieved in the world only by money
 adhik se adhik sukh praapt karne ke liye vah adhik se adhik dhan praapt karne kaa praytn karata he
 In the worry of obtaining this wealth, he often does not consider how the money is being received
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki dhan aise sadhano dwaara bhi praapt kiya jaataa he jinase dusron kaa shoshan hota he, dusron ko dukh pahunchataa he
 In this way, many examples of obtaining wealth can be given
 poonjipati adhik dhan praapt karne kii chintaa main apane mazdooron ko uchit mazdooree nahin detaa
 This causes the condition of workers to deteriorate
 duukaandaar khaadya padaartho main milawat karke apane graahakon ke swasthya ko nasht karata he
 Many simple people are cheated by thieves, Mahajan ruins families of innumerable individuals by taking excessive interest from borrowers and excessive rent from landlord farmers
 prakruti kaa yah atal niyam he ki jo jaisaa bota he usko vaisaa hi kaatna padataa he
 Those who receive money by exploiting others or causing grief may forget this rule
 jo dhan dusron ko dukh pahunchaakar praapt hota he usase ant main du:kha hi miltaa he
 To expect happiness from him is futile
 yah satya he ki dusron ko dukh pahunchaakar jo dhan praapt kiya jaataa he usase icchit vastuen praapt kii ja sakati he or in vastuon ko praapt karne se sukh mil saktaa he
 But this happiness is temporary and eventually becomes a cause of sorrow
 sansar main aisi kai vastuen hai jinka upyog karne se tatkaal to sukh miltaa he, parantu dirghakaal main unase dukh kii prapti hoti he
 For example, there is immediate pleasure from the consumption of intoxicating substances, but when they become habitual, then their intake starts in excessive quantity, which has a bad effect on health
 isse ant main du:khee hona padataa he
 The wealth gained by harming others certainly increases bad habits and by giving temporary happiness for some time it becomes a means of increasing grief
 dusron ko dukh dekar praapt kiya hua dhan kabhi bhi sthaayee sukh or shanti kaa sadhak nahin ho saktaa
 There are two types of happiness
 kuch sukh to aise hai jo dusron ko dukh pahunchaakar praapt hote hai
 Examples of these have been given above
 kuch sukh aise hai jo dusron ko sukhi banaakar prapt hote hai
 They create peace in human mind
 apana kartavya paalan karne se jo sukh praapt hota he vah bhi shanti prad hota he kartavyapaalan karte samay jo shram karnaa padataa he usase kuch ksht avashya maaloom hota he, parantu kaary puraa hone par vah du:kha sukh main parinat ho jaataa he or usasen man main shanti utpann hoti he
 This kind of happiness is not a means of sorrow in future and this type of happiness is called bliss
 jab anand hi anand praapt hota he tab du:kha kaa lesh maatr bhi nahin rah jaataa
 Such a condition is called ecstasy
 paramanand praapt karnaa prayek vyakti kaa sarvottam dhyey he
 That is the peak of autism
 prayek manushya kaa kalyaan isi main he ki vah paramanand praapt karne kaa hameshaa praytn karata rahe
 He always enjoys happiness that does not become the cause or means of sorrow in future and he starts to experience peace and contentment
 jab ham apane prayatnon dwaara dusron ko sukh pahunchaate hai or unke kalyaan ke saadhan ban jate hai tab prakruti ke atal niyam ke anusaar inhen prayatnon dwaara hamaare kalyaan main bhi vruddhi hone lagati he
 The simple way to achieve autism is to become a means of welfare of others
 isi prakaar apane kaaryon dwaara kisi ko bhi du:kha na pahunchaana apane dukh se bachane kaa sabase saral tarika he
 Everyone should understand well that his true interest can only be proved by the benefit or charity of others
 isse yah spasht he ki dusron kaa sukh arthath vishwakalyaan hi apane sthaayee sukh or shanti arthath aatmakalyaan kaa ekmaatr saadhan he
 When every person will always try for the welfare of others for their welfare, then there will be no opposition to selfishness in any way, all kinds of conflict in the world will go away and everywhere happiness and peace will be permanently established
 aatmakalyaan ke liye yah aavashyak he ki prayek vyakti dusron ke swaarthon ko utana hi mahatv de jitna vah apane swaarth ko detaa he
 Just as he tries to increase his pleasures, similarly he should also try to increase the pleasures of others
 iskaa parinam yah hoga ki aise kaary band ho jaayenge jinke kaaran dusron ke du:khon kii vruddhi hoti he
 With this, there will be a continuous increase of happiness in the lives of the world and the welfare of the world will reach a growing climax
 bina vishwakalyaan ke kisi bhi vyakti kaa aatmakalyaan nahin ho saktaa
 True autism can only be achieved by world welfare
 aatmakalyaan hi prayek vyakti kaa sarvottam dhyey he or jab arthshaastra manushya ke aarthik prayatnon kaa adhyayan karata he tab uskaa dhyey bhi aatmakalyaan hi hona chahie
 But, as stated above, true autism can only be achieved by world welfare
 isliye arthshaastra kaa dhyey vishwakalyaan hi hona chahie
 We have already told that when a wish is not fulfilled, then one experiences sorrow
 isliye yadi kisi vastu kii ichha hi na kii jaae to du:kha praapt karne kaa avasar hi na praapt ho
 Some gentlemen are of the opinion that the lack of sorrow and permanent happiness and peace can be achieved by the retirement of all desires
 isliye is drushti se dekha jaae tab to sab ichchhaaon kaa abhaav hi arthshaastra kaa dhyey hona chahie
 It is fine that through practice one can control desires, but to achieve such condition when any kind of desire does not arise, it is not practical for one of the ordinary person
 astu, arthshaastra kaa dhyey sampurna ichchhaaon ke abhaav ko maan lene se thode se vyaktiyon kaa hi kalyaan ho sakegaa or janata kaa usase kuch bhi laabh na hoga, isliye is dhyey ko maan lenaa uchit na hoga
 Some people believe that human welfare is the goal of economics
 ve jeevajantuon tathaa pashupakshiyon ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak nahin samajhate
 They probably believe that God created animals and animals and birds for human happiness only
 isliye unako du:kha pahunchaakar yaa vadh karke yadi manushyon kii ichchhaaon kii purti ho sakati ho to unako du:kha pahunchaane main kuch bhi aapatti nahin honi chahie
 But theology and Mahatma Gandhi are of the opinion that every person should do such a work that interests the 'universal interest' i
e
 all the living beings, so that no one is harmed
 jab manushya prayek jeevadharee ke hit ko apane nijee hit ke samaan maanane lagata he tabhi usko sthaayee sukh or shanti praapt hoti he
 Mahatma Gandhi has named this route 'sarvodaya'
 is sarvoday maarg dwaara hi sansar main prayek prakaar kaa sangharsh dur ho saktaa he, shoshan kaa ant ho saktaa he or vishwashanti sthapit ho sakati he
 The path of Sarvodaya is the best means to increase the welfare and welfare of every person
 isliye unke anusaar arthshaastra kaa dhyey maanavkalyaan na maanakar vishwakalyaan hi maananaa chahie
 In relation to the subject matter of economics, a description of economic activities is also necessary
 purv main utpaadan, upbhog, vinimay tathaa vitaran - arthshaastra ke ye chaar pradhan ang maane jate the
 In modern economics, these verbs can be divided into five parts
 aarthik kriyaaon ke uddeshy ke aadhaar par 1933 main sarvapratham reganar frrish ne arthshaastra ko do bhaagon main baanta
 International trade, foreign regulations, banking, etc
 are forms of macroeconomics
 sankshep main, adhyayan ke drushtikon se arthshaastra ke vibhinn angon ko ham is prakaar rakh sakate hai: It studies individual units, such as individuals, families, firms, industries, the value of a particular commodity
 boldig keanusaar, vyashti arthshaastra vishesh fermo, vishesh pariwaron, vaiyaktik keemton, mazdooriyon, aayon, vaiyaktik udyogon tathaa vishisht vastuon kaa adhyayan he
 It gives importance to marginal analysis
 aadhunik aarthik sinddhanth ke bahut se mahatvapurn vishay jaise antarrashtriya vyapaar, videshi vinimay, rajasav, baking, vyapaar chakra, rashtriya aay tathaa rojgaar ke siddhant, aarthik niyojan evam aarthik vikaas aadi kaa adhyayan iske antargat hota he
 In Bolding's terms, macroeconomics is that part of economics that studies the large groups and averages of economics, not its special items
 vah in samoohon ko upyogi dhang se paribhaashit karne kaa praytn karata he tathaa inke parsparik sambandhon ko jaanchata he
 In short, it is part of economics
 kence ke baad ke aadhunik arthshaastri ab kuch nae naamon se arthshaastra ke vibhinn angon kaa vivechan karte hai, jaise puunji kaa arthshaastra, poonji nirmaan, shram arthshaastra, yatayaat kaa arthshaastra, maudrik arthshaastra, kenciy arthshaastra, alp viksit deshon kaa arthshaastra, vikaas kaa arthshaastra, tulanatmk arthshaastra, antarrashtriya arthshaastra aadi
 In the modern period, postgraduate education in the subject of economics in the country and abroad is also given according to the papers of these names
 aarthik pranali ) ek aisi pranali he jiske antargat vibhinn vyavsaayon main kaam karke log apni jeevika kamaate he
 Each country adopts a different economic system to conduct economic activities smoothly
 aarthik pranaaliyon ko mukhya rup se teen bhaagon main baanta gaya he
 Socialism and capitalism are mentioned most in modern economic systems
 prayek desh, chaahe vah kisi bhi aarthik pranali ke antargat kaam karata he, usko vibhinn aarthik samasyaon jaise garibi, dhan va aay kii asamanta, berogari, mudrasphiti va mandi aadi kaa saamana karnaa padataa hai
 He adopts various policies to solve these problems
 mukhya aarthik nitiyaan is prakaar he
 India has its own special tradition of knowing, understanding and using economics
 yah du:kha kaa vishay he ki pracheen ev naveen bhartiya arthshaastriyon kii pramukh kritiyon kaa moolyankan uchit rup se abhi tak nahin kiya gaya he or hamaare vidhyaarthee keval paashchaatya arthshaastriyon evam unke siddhanto ko padhate rahe hai
 We derive the economic ideas of ancient times from the Vedas, Upanishads, epics, theology, the Grihasutras, the scriptures of Narada, Venus, Vidur and most importantly the Arthashastra of Kautilya
 aadhunik bharat main mukhya bhartiya arthshaastriyon main- This ideology of economics practiced by Mahatma Gandhi and used by Acharya Vinoba Bhave is very modern and is a unique gift of Indians
 iske atanrgat gramswarajya, swaavlamban, sashastitv ke prayog tathaa ahimsak kranti jaise vichaar hai, jo, jaiprakash narayan ke shabdon main, bharat main hi nahin, vishwa main kahin bhi kabhi bhi aarthik kanti laa sakate hai
 They are being used in India along with new education
 aadhunik arthshaastra aadhe se adhik ganitiya maadlon, saadhyon, samikarnon tathaa formulon main bandha gaya he
 Earlier, economists used to use statistics as a voluntary but now it has become mandatory for economics
 iske atirikt arthmiti bhi vikaas mahojidlon main purna viksit ho rahi he
 From 'in-put out-put analysis' to economics, economics has removed from 'game theory' and 'technical flow'
 aarthik siddhanton ko spasht karne hetu ganitiya aujaaron kaa prayog sab arthshaastri kar rahe hai
 Under Linear Programming and 'differentiation Process', economists are trying to show mathematical visual effects as well as invisible economic effects
 gananaa kii choti mashin se lekar vishaltam computer tak arthshaastriyon kii ganitiya pragati ke vyaavhaarik rup hai

 Like X-rays when they deduced the wavelengths of these electrons based on the equation: m λ = 2 d sin ⁡ θ { \ displaystyle m \ lambda = 2d \ sin \ theta \ ,}; λ = wavelength), then they came to know that these wavelength values are exactly the same as those of de Broglie's equation: λ = hp { \ displaystyle \ lambda = { \ frac {h} {p}} \ ,} 
 yahan h plank kaa niyatank he, p electron kaa samveg
 This was the first experiment that proved the wavelet properties of electrons which were predicted by LD Broglie in 1924 based on the principles of mathematics

 It was also observed that as the velocity of electrons increases, the diameter of these circles decreases, which makes it clear that the wavelength of electrons decreases with increasing velocity, because such diffraction shapes can only be formed by waves, not Therefore, the use of rays completely proves that electrons behave like waves
 1928 i

 The method adopted in this is as follows: The gas or vapor is released as the electron in the path of electrons, wherein the electrons fall on the photo plate only after hitting it

 'khaadya suraksha', jaise ki yah kaarykram janaa jaataa he, 1975 ke varshon tak shrimati gandhi ke liye samarthan kii ek or strot rahi
 In the early 1960s, the organized Green Revolution was the informal name for the intensive agriculture district program, under which the people of the cities, on whose support Gandhi was, in fact, deeply dependent on all Indian politicians, abound Cheap grain was guaranteed
 yah kaarykram chaar charnon par aadhaarit tha: This program, which lasted for ten years, eventually led to a threefold increase in wheat production and a small but attractive increase in rice; While there was little or no growth in cereals such as barley, gram and coarse cereals - still a relatively stable yield remained in these areas
 gandhi kii sarkaar ko unki 1971 ke jabardast janadesh ke baad pramukh kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 The internal structure of the Congress Party, weakened as a result of its numerous divisions, became entirely dependent on his leadership in determining the fate of elections
 gandhi kaa san 1971 kii taiyaari main naare kaa vishay tha garibi hataao
 This slogan and the blueprint of the proposed Poverty Hatao program, which came with it, were designed to give Gandhi an independent national support based on the rural and urban poor
 is tarah unhen pramukh gramin jatiyon ke dabadabe main rahe rajya or sthaneey sarkaron evam shahari vyapaaree varg ko andekha karne kii anumati rahi thi
 And, the share of the poor who remained unimpressed in the past, at least both the political value and the political weight, increased

 "these programs also presented the central political leadership the ownership of distributing new and vast resources throughout the country 


" "ultimately, Poor Hatao Poor was of little use: only 4% of all funds allocated for economic development, three The major went for poverty removal programs and almost none reached the "poorest of the poor" class
 is tarah yadhyapi yah kaarykram garibi ghataane main asafal rahi, isane gandhi ko chunaav jitaneka lakshya hasil kar liya
 Gandhi had already been accused of authoritarian conduct
 unki majboot sansadeey bahumat kaa vyavhaar kar, unki sattarudh bhartiya rashtriya congress ne samvidhan main sanshodhan kar kendra or rajyon ke bich ke satta santulan ko badal diya tha
 He twice declared states ruled by opposition parties as "lawless and chaotic" and took control of them by imposing President's rule under Article 356 of the Constitution
 iske alaava,sanjay gandhi, jo nirvaachit adhikariyon kii jagah par gandhi ke kareebi rajnatik salaahkaar bane the, ke badhate prabhaav par, pi

 Seeing his new inclination towards the use of authoritarian power, eminent personalities and ex-freedom fighters like Jayaprakash Narayan, Satendra Narayan Sinha and Acharya Jivataram Kripalani toured all over India campaigning actively against him and his government
 raaj narayan dwaara daayar ek chunaav yachika main kathith taur par bhrashtachar aaropon ke aadhaar par12 june, 1975 ko elahabaad ucch nyaayalay ne indira gandhi ke lok sabha chunaav ko radd ghoshit kar diya
 Thus the court ordered a ban against him from leaving the seat of parliament and participating in elections for six years
 pradhanmantritv ke liye lok sabha yaa rajya sabha kaa sadsy hona anivaary he
 Thus, this decision effectively freed him from office
 jab gandhi ne faisle par apil kii, rajnatik puunji hasil karne ko utsuk vipakshi dalon or unke samarthak, unke istife ke liye, samuhik rup se chakkar kaatane lage
 The strike carried out by a large number of unions and protesters stalled life in many states
 is aandolan ko majboot karne ke liye, jaiprakash narayan ne police ko nihathe bheed par sambhaby goli chalaane ke aadesh kaa ulanghan karne ke liye aahvaan kiya
 Huge crowds of protesters surrounded the Parliament House and his residence in Delhi due to difficult economic times as well as disenchantment of the people with his government and demanded his resignation
 gandhi ne vyavastha ko punarsthapit karne ke padakshep swarup, ashaanti machaanevaale zyaadaatar virodhiyon ke giraftaar kaa aadesh de diya
 Thereafter it was recommended by his cabinet and government that President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed declare a state of emergency in view of the chaos and chaos that followed the Allahabad High Court decision

 Gandhi used emergency provisions to obtain his own extraordinary rights
 "unke pita nehru ke vipareet, jo apane vidhaayi dalon or rajya party sanghathanon ke niyantran main majboot mukhyamantriyon se nipatna pasand karte the, shrimati gandhi prayek congressi mukhyamantri ko, jinka ek swatantra aadhaar hota, hataane tathaa un mantrion ko jo unke prati vyaktigat rup se vafaadaar hote, unke sthalabhisikt karne main lag gayi

" It is also alleged that he further proposed to President Ahmed to issue such ordinances which do not need to be debated in Parliament and allow them order-based governance
 saath hi saath, gandhi kii sarkaar ne prativaadion ko ukhaad phenkane tathaa hajaaron ke taadaad main raajnneetik kaaryakartaaon ke giriftaar or atak rakhane kaa ek abhiyaan prarambh kiya;jag mohan ke paryvekshan main, jo kii baad main dilli ke leftinent governor rahe, jama masjid ke aasapaas based bastiyon ke hataane main sanjay kaa haath rahaa jisame kathith taur par hajaaron log beghar hue or saikadon maare gayi or is tarah desh kii rajdhani ke un bhaagon main sampradayik katutaa paidaa kar di; or hajaron purushon par balpurvak nasbandi kaa parivaar niyojan kaarykram chalaaya gaya, jo praayash: bahut nimnastar se lagu kiya gaya tha
 Gandhi called elections in 1977 to give voters another chance to approve that rule

 Until Gandhi won the by-election in 1978, he found himself karmaless, incomeless and homeless
 1977 ke chunaav abhiyaan main congress party kaa vibhaajan ho gaya: jagjivan ram jaise samarthakon ne unka saath chhod diya
 The Congress party was now a very small group, officially being the opposition in Parliament

 This arrest meant that Indira was automatically expelled from Parliament
 parantu yah ranneeti ulte apadapurna ban gai
 His arrest and long-running trial earned him sympathy from many people who had been afraid to consider him a dictator just two years earlier
 janata gathbandhan sirf shrimati gandhi kii nafrat se ekajute hua tha
 The government was stuck in petty squabbles over minor issues and Gandhi was able to use this situation in his favor
 unhone phir se, apatkaal ke dauraan hui "galatiyon" ke liye kaushalpurna dhang se kshamapraarthi hokar bhaashan dena prarambh kar diya
 In June 1979, Desai resigned and Charan Singh was appointed Prime Minister by Reddy on the promise of Mrs Gandhi that the Congress would support his government from outside

 Explosives are some compounds or mixtures in which they erupt with a big bang when set on fire or strike
 dhamaake kaa kaaran bade alp kaal main bahut badi maatra main gaison kaa bananaa hota he
 Such substances are called "explosives"
 aaj bahut badi maatra main visphotakon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Explosives have two purposes: shaantikaal main unase chattaanon ko udaaya or koyale or anya khanijon ko kam kharch main khaanon se nikaala jaataa he tathaa During the war, enemies are protected from harm by explosions

 Explosives are a mixture of chemical substances, which are detonated due to the formation of a large amount of gas with the hammer being hit or touched by a flame, or the sudden heat produced by electrically blasting
 yadi kisi band kaksh main visphoton ho, to kaksh kii deevaaren chhin bhinn ho jaati he
 But beneficial explosives are essentially inert, so that their manufacture and transport are safe
 kuch visphotak aise hote hai ki pankh se chune par bhi ve visphutit ho jate hai
 Such explosives are of no useful use
 upyogi visphotakon main kuch ucch visphotak hote hai or kuch saamaanya yaa mand visphotak
 This distinction is not made on the basis of their sensitivity, but on their ability to differentiate
 kuch visphotak, jaise mercury falminute tathaa lead azid, jo bade sugrahi hote hai, praathmik visphotak ke rup main nune sugrahi visphotak ke visphoton main upyukt hote hai
 Some of the major explosives are: 1
 dynamite -- teevr visphotak, shaantikaal ke liye 2
 Explosive Gelatin - For intense explosive, peacetime 3
 tianti -- teevr visphotak, yuddh ke liye 4
 Picric acid - for intense explosive warfare 5
 ammonium nitrate -- teevr visphotak yuddh ke liye 6
 Smokeless powder - Dim explosive, for war 7
 kalachurna yaa barood -- mand visphotak, shanti or yuddh donon ke liye 8
 Mercury Falminet --- Auxiliary explosive, for warfare 9
 lead azid --- sahaayak visphotak, yuddh ke liye Nitroglycerin is used in the manufacture of dynamite
 nitroglisreen aavashyaktaa se adhik sugrahi hota he
 Keyslagar is used to reduce its sensitivity
 america main kizalgar ke sthaan main kaath chura, yaa kaath samita or sodium nitrate kaa upyog hota he
 The amount of nitroglycerin in dynamite is 20, 40, or 60 75 per cent
 isaki prabalata nitroglisreen kii maatra par nirbhar karti he
 Dynamite with 75 percent nitroglycerin is predominant
 kizalgar, yaa kashthachurna, yaa samita ke prayog kaa uddeshy dynamite kaa sangrakshan hota he, taaki yatayaat main vah visphutit na ho jaae
 Nitroglycerin 13 ° c But freezes jam jane par yah visphutit nahin hota
 Therefore, to avoid it becoming useless in frosty climate, 20 parts glycerin dinitromonoclo-rhhydrin is added to it
 yah jamaavarodhikarak kaa kaam karata he
 This allows nitroglycerin-30 ° C
 Till the fluid remains
 nitroglisreen ke sthaan main nitroglykol kaa upyog ab hone laga he
 Explosive gelatin contains 90 percent glycerin and 10 percent nitrocellulose
 tii en tii trinitrotolvin he
 It is 81 degrees Celsius But melts

 It is a yellow solid, 121 ° C
 But melts
 iskaa sis lavan picrik amla se 5 guna adhik sugrahi hota he
 The picric acid itself is filled in the shell
 ammonium nitrate tii en tii ke saath milakar prayukt hota he
 It also acts as an oxidizer
 swayan yah kathinata se prasphotin hota he
 Nitrocellulose is present in smokeless powder
 yah asitone se geletinikrut kiya rahata he
 Small amounts of diphenylamine and urea are used as stabilizers
 visphotakon kii kshamta do baton, prasphot kii tivrata or prasphot ke sanchaaran ke veg par nirbhar karti he
 The ability to discolor is based on both of these properties
 tivrata gaison or ooshmaa ke unmukt hone par nirbhar karti he
 For this, a known load of explosive is detonated by placing it in the cavity of the siphon
 isse sis nipind kii guha kaa uttanan ho jaataa he
 The volume of a cavity is a measure of the intensity of an explosive
 ek duusari vidhi main 500 pound morter ko lolak ke rup main latakaate he or usase 36 pound kaa gola chhodte hai
 This causes the mortar to rebound
 morter kaa yahi pratikshep prabalata kii maap he
 Both methods often yield only one result
 kathor chattaanon ko udaane ke liye prabal or ucch vegavaale visphotakon kii aavashyaktaa padati he or kam kathor chattaanon ke liye kam prabal or mand veg vaale visphotakon se kaam chal jaataa he
 One feature of the importance of explosives is its sensitivity
 sugrahita kaa pareekshan visphotak par bhaar giraakar kiya jaataa he
 The higher it falls from higher altitude, the less sensitive it is
 jo visphotak koyale kii khaanon main vyavahrut hote hai, unka pareekshan ek vishesh prakaar se hota he, kyoking koyale kii khaanon main jvalansheel gaisen rah sakati hai
 Explosives that do not erupt in such gases are used in mines
 aise visphotakon kii jwaala choti or alpakaalik hoti he
 The length and duration of the flame are measured by photography
 barood kii samyavadhi 0
077 second or jwaala kii lambaai 110 mimi
 tathaa gancoton kii samyavadhi 0
0013 second or jwaala kii lambaai 97 mimi
 hoti he
 The duration and flame length of picric acid ammonium nitrate are much shorter than this
 gancoton kii topakaksh main visphutit karne se prati varg inch lagbhag 3 ton kaa dabaav utpann hota he
 There are two types of explosives used in war: pranodak, jo kaartuson main bhare jate hai, tathaa Those which are filled in a round shell
 rifl ke kaartoos main bhi ek pranodak or duusari bullate yaa goli ja yashad-tamra mishradhatu kii bani hoti he, sis ke nichol main rakhi hoti he
 Tankmar rifles have steel bullets
 hathgole main koi pranodak nahin hota
 Nitrocellulose in the form of fiber is highly explosive, but after being gelatinized becomes dim explosive
 akele yaa anya padaarthon ke saath milakar, yahi pradhanthya mand visphotak ke rup main vyavahrut hoti he
 The pill shell contains TNT, or ametol, picric acid, or its salts
 iskaa kaam hota he nidisht sthaan par pahunchakar, tivrgami tukdon main chur chur ho janaa or vaastavik missile yaa astr ban janaa
 The shell holds a ball tied to rosin or ammo 
 aise khol ko "shrepnel shell" kehete hai
 Battle gas may also remain in place of the ball
 khol ko palite dwaara jalaayaa jaataa he
 The shell is made of steel
 bahudhaa usamen aluminium kii naaknuma dhar lagi rahati he
 Nitrogen is 12
8 percent of the nitrocellulose used in explosives
 rakhane par dhoomahin churna kaa hraas hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to keep testing it periodically
 cordit main nitrocelulose or nitroglisreen donon rahete hai
 Their relative quantity is not fixed
 ek cordit main nitrocelulose 65 bhaag, nitroglisreen 30 bhaag or khanij jelly 0
5 bhaag rahete hai
 a second chordite contains nitrocellulose 37 parts, nitroglycerin 58 parts and jelly 0
5 parts

 yahan ke nivaasiyon ne 1857 ke viplav main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Chief revolutionaries among them were - Chaudhary tremendous Khan and Chaudhary Ulfat Khan
 britaniyon ke viruddh kranti main sanlagn hone ke kaaran choudhary jabardast khan evam choudhary ulfat khan ko unke samarthakon ke saath mrityudand diya gaya
 But the residents of Hapur still remember their martyrdom
 hapur main 1857 main shahid hone vaale krantikariyon kii yaad main 1975 i
 se prativarsh shahid meley kaa aayojan kiya jaataa he
 Which starts from May 10 and lasts for a month
 sampoorn desh main 1857 se sambaddh is prakaar ke meley kaa aayojan anyatra kahin nahi kiya jaataa
 Chaudhary Jatir Khan's family was originally from the village of Asauda, who, due to their zamindari, later resided in Hapur's Muhalla Bhanda Patti
 choudhary jabardast khan, samast khan, ulfat khan, amjad khan, duulhe khan sahit saat bhai the, ek bahin bhi thi
 There was a friendly relationship between Nawab Walidad Khan of Malagarh and Chaudhary Zahit Khan
 "nawab validaad khan ke putr kii shaadi nawab mujffarnagar kii iklauti putree ke saath hui thi
 The procession left from Malagarh for Muzaffarnagar
 hapur raste main hone ke kaaran baraat yahan se hokar jaani thi
 On coming here, Nawab Walidad Khan sent Chaudhary tremendous Khan as the head of the procession and returned himself
 is ghatana se donon ke madhya dostana sambandhon kii pushti hoti hai
 The Nawab Muzaffarnagar gave a grand welcome to the procession and Chaudhary Jatri Khan
 baraat do maah se adhik samay tak nawab mujffarnagar ke yahan ruki rahi, jo vyakti baraat kii soochna praapt karne jate unhen bhi vaapis nahin aane diya jaataa, is kaaran baratiyon kii sankhya kaaphi adhik ho gayi
 In place of Nawab Validad, Chaudhary tremendous Khan performed the responsibility of the groom's father
 nawab mujffarnagar kii putree iklauti thi isliye nawab ne apni sampoorn jaaydaad apni ladki evam damaad ke superd kar di
 " hamaara anumaan he ki validaad khan kisi gupt evam ati mahatv ke kaary main lage hone ke kaaran putr kii shaadi main na ja sake honge or yah bhi ki yah kaam pehle se nirdhaarit nahin rahaa hoga balki achaanak lag gaya hoga
 If this particular work had been foreseen, the Nawab could have withdrawn the date of Validad Shah
 saath hi kaary itane adhik mahatv kaa hoga ki shaadi ke ain vakt par ve na to shaadi taal sakate the or na hi kaam ko wilimbit kar sakate the
 Finally, the question arises what exactly was this work? We believe that this work, and nothing else, must have been related to its plan or its planners before the revolution of 1857
 tatkaaleen paristhitiyon main sakshya samooh isi anumaan ko bal pradaan karata he ki shaadi kaa samay 1857 kii basant ritu ke aas-paas hoga
 By considering this one can easily guess
 itihaaskaar is par ekamat hai ki 10 may 1857 ko meerut se achaanak kranti prasphutit hui thi
 Therefore, it would not be evidenced that its eruption has a prior perception to Validad Khan
 atah saralata se is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ja saktaa he ki shaadi kii tithi 10 may se kuch purv nahokar hi kaaphi pehle rahi hogi
 On assuming this, father Validad Khan, instead of wasting precious time in his son's wedding, would have thought it appropriate to contact the planners and discharge their role in the revolution
 nawab validaad khan ek doordarshee vyakti the
 Contemporary historical sources confirm this
 1857 ke samay nawab validaad khan kaa malagarh riyasat main shashan tha tathaa mughal darbar main unhen vishesh sthaan praapt tha
 At the time of revolution, Emperor Bahadur Shah also handed over to him the responsibilities of Bulandshahr, Aligarh and adjoining areas
 1857 main mughal badshaah dwaara krantikariyon kaa saath dene ke kaaran validaad khan ne bhi unka saath diya tathaa angrejon ke viruddh apane kshetra kaa netritv kiya
 Chaudhary Zahir Khan, having close ties with Nawab Walidad Khan, fully supported the rebellion and led the revolutionary villagers of Hapur on a regional basis
 hapur tehsil main kai maah tak markat machi rahi
 The revolutionaries cut all the telephone wires between Hapur and Bulandshah
 validaad khan or jabardast khan ne hapur main britaniyon par akraman karne kii yojana banaayi lekin britaniyon ke samarthakon ev bulandashahar jile main bhatona gaanv ke jaaton ke kaaran yah yojana kriyanvit na ho saki
 Williams was eventually accompanied by a powerful British contingent to halt the increasing activities of revolutionaries in Hapur
 usne hapur ke angrej adhikari wilson kii sahaayta se choudhary jabarast khan tathaa unke bhai ulfat khan ko anek samarthako sahit giraftaar kar liya
 Many revolutionaries went away from Hapur
 angrej adhikariyon ne choudhary jabardast khan tathaa choudhary ulfat khan sahit unke anek samarthakon ko vidrohi ghoshit karte hue mrityudand kaa aadesh diya
 All the people, who were hanged near the old tehsil in Hapur, were cut in time
 usee vriksh ke sthaan par aaj hapur kaa telephone axenge bana hua he
 Its wall is adjacent to the Tehsil wall
 yah hapur main bulandashahar road par sthit he
 At that time, the silk cord was hanged
 aisa mana jaataa he ki choudhary jabardast khan ko teen baar phaansi lagaayi gayi parantu teenon baar hi phaansi kaa fanda tut gaya
 Seeing this, the British officer Wilson expressed surprise and made up his mind to leave the overwhelming Khan alive
 choudhary jabardast khan ko phaansi ke takhte se utaar liya gaya or unke pani maangane par pani pilwane kaa aadesh bhi diya
 But the opponents of overwhelming Khan did not want him to be left alive
 unhone british adhikari se prarthana kii, ki agar choudhary jabardast khan ko jivit chhod diya gaya to vah hamen jinda nahin chhodega
 Because he had helped the Britishers against the Chaudhary Tremendous Khan during the revolution, Wilson accepted his request
 jab jabardast khan pani pi rahe the tab unhone uski canapati par goli maar di
 Chaudhary became a martyr for the tremendous Khan country
 unki sampoorn jaaydaad jabt karne tathaa parivaar ke anya sadasyon ko mrityudand kaa aadesh bhi british adhikari ne diya
 Abdullah Khan and Wadullah Khan, who are said to be the sons of Chaudhary tremendous Khan, took away one of their loyal servants away from Hapur and after several years they returned when Hapur was peaceful

 In real estate transactions, a warranty deed is a promise that the buyer's ownership of a land will be defended
 ek varantee ko vyakt kiya ja saktaa he yaa vah nihit ho sakati he
 There is a guarantee from the seller of the product that specifies the extent to which an assurance of the quality or performance of that product is assured and an explanation of the conditions under which that product may be returned, to be changed
 Can be, or can be repaired
 ise aksar ek vishisht, likhit "varantee" dastavej ke rup main diya jaataa he
 However, a warranty may also arise from the seller's description of the goods and perhaps even legal rules based on their source and quality, and any variation of material from that specification would violate the guarantee
 For example, an advertisement describing a product is often filled with express warranties; That product must conform to the advertised description
 Many advertisers include disclaimers for this purpose
 Generally, a written warranty assures the buyer that the item is of good quality and is defective in "material and design"
 ek express varantee ko maukhik rup se, likhit or vastav main vikreta dwaara varantee banane ke kisi iraade ke bina banaaya ja saktaa he
 In the United States, a seller is allowed to form his own opinion for the price known as puffery and which a buyer cannot rely on as the basis of the transaction
 For example, "this hunter knife is the best knife in the world" is simply over-praise, while a statement such as "this hunter knife is never required to be sharpened" can be interpreted as an express warranty when Even that knife is used for its intended purpose
 kuch anya deshon main, aise upabhokta sangrakshan kanoon maujuud hai jo vigyapandaataaon ko asaty yaa asiddh bayaan dene se rokte hai
 Misuse of a well-known trademark can also convey an express warranty, the violation of which is called "passing off"; The source and quality of the goods were misrepresented
 kuch utpaadon ke saath varantee hoti he jiske tahat maheene, saal yaa aaajeevan marammat yaa pratisthaapan kaa vaada hota he
 In theory, a person can return a product to a "dealer" for repair, but most shops — and also manufacturers — that sell such products lack repair facilities
 car dealron ke paas aisi marammat kii dukaane hoti hai jiske chalate bahut se log nai kaaren kharidte hai; computer dealer or upabhokta electronics dealron ke paas 1990 ke dashak main is tarah kii dukaane hua karti thim, lekin inamen se adhikansh ab lupt ho chuki hai
 In practice, a product that fails within a month can be replaced by a new one under the shop's guarantee; Or a product that fails after the store's guarantee expires but has a manufacturer's guarantee remaining can be replaced by the manufacturer - the store guarantee and the manufacturer's warranty are mutually exclusive
 kabhi aisi marammat kii dukaane hua karti thim jo chote vidyut upkarnon ke liye varantee seva pradaan karti thim, jaise ki vidyut reiser yaa lamp or toster; lekin 1980 ke dashak main, unamem se adhikansh patr agreshan seva main badal gaye jo varantee vaale utpaada ko nirmaataaon ke paas pratisthapit karne ke liye bhejte the or unamem se adhikansh 1990 ke dashak main gaayab ho gaye
 There are some exceptions: Some companies - notably Toshiba - actually repair products under warranty
 thomas freedman bataate hai ki kaise toshiba ne upies ke maamle main varantee kaaryon ko sabhaalane ke liye ek vyavastha kaa nirmaan kiya: ek graahak, jisane toshiba kii website se sidhe computer kaa order diya he, vah upies ke madhyam se kharaab computer ko toshiba ko bhej saktaa he
 In fact, he never reaches Toshiba
 balki upies, toshiba-computer kii marammat kii swayan kii dukaane rakhata he
 When UPS picks up the user's computer, it sends it to the UPS shop, where it is fixed, tested, and returned to the user within a specified time frame
 saamaanya taur par, upyogkarta ke software or data ko sangrakshit rakhaa jaataa he
 An implied warranty is one that arises from the understanding of the nature of the deal and the buyer's implied rather than the express representations of the seller
 vanijopayogita kii varantee garbhit hoti he, jab tak ki naam dwaara spasht rup se asweekaar naa ho, yaa bikri ko is vaakyansh ke saath pahachaanaa gaya ho "yatha rup main" yaa "sabhi dosha ke saath
" "vikrey" hone ke liye, maal ko ek saadhaaran kreta kii ummiido ke yathochit anukool hona chahie, arthath ve vahi hai jo ve kehete hai
 For example, a fruit that has a good appearance and aroma but which has hidden defects will violate the commercial utility warranty if its quality does not meet the standards of a fruit that is "commonly established in business"
 In Massachusetts consumer protection law, it is illegal to reject this warranty on household consumer goods, etc
 vishesh uddeshy ke liye fitness kii varantee tab nihit hoti he jab ek kharidaar ek vishisht anurodh ke anukool maal chayan ke liye vikreta par nirbhar karata he
 For example, this warranty is violated when a buyer asks for a snow tire from a mechanic and in return receives tires that are unsafe for use in snow
 is nihit varantee ko naam dwaara spasht rup se asweekaar kiya ja saktaa he, jisase kharabi ke jokhim ko waapas kharidaar par daal diya jaataa he
 a lifetime warranty is usually on the life of a product in the market and not on the consumer's lifetime
 If a product has been discontinued and is no longer available, the warranty may last a limited period
 udhaaharan ke liye, cisco simit jeevankaal varantee utpaada ko band kar die jane ke baad vartmaan main paanch saal tak rahati he
 The importance of the used / second-hand products market as a share of the total market has been growing significantly since the beginning of the twenty-first century
 second-hand utpaadon main ve utpaada shaamil hai jo pehle kisi upabhokta / upyogkarta dwaara istemaal kiye ja chuke hai
 Users change their products even when they are in good condition
 computer or mobile phone jaise kuch utpaadon kaa ek laghu jeevankaal hota he or in utpaadon kii praudyogikiyaan bazaar main aae din jari hoti rahati hai
 As a result, the sale of new products is often associated with a replacement system, resulting in a market for second-hand products
 udhaaharan ke liye, france main istemaal kii gai kaaron kii ikai bikri 1990 or 2005 ke bich 4

 a warranty is breached when a promise is broken; At the time of sale, when the goods are not as expected, whether the defect is obvious or not
 The seller must return the money or replace Vastu in time, respecting that warranty
 If the seller refuses to honor the warranty, then she commences time under the statute of sale period for a court complaint of breach of warranty
 is avadhi ko aksar vahaan andekha kiya jaataa he jahaan ek "vistaarit varantee" hoti he, jisamen ek vikreta yaa nirmaataa us vistaarit avadhi ke bheetar vifal hone vaale maal kii marammat yaa use pratisthapit karne kii atirikt seva pradaan karne kaa anubandh karata he
 However, if the goods were defective at the time of sale and the relevant statute has not expired, the existence or duration of any "extended warranty" is secondary: there is a breach of a primary warranty for which the seller could have been liable
 
 apraasangik vistaarit varantee kii samaapti kaa daawa karte hue praathmik varantee ke ulanghan kii javabdehi se bachane kaa prayaas karnaa ek anuchit or bhraamak vyapaar abhyaas ho saktaa he
 a term law claim in a contract may be shorter than a tort claim and some cases of warranty breach are filed late and are identified as a fraud or other related tort
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek upabhokta ek vastu kharidta he jo package se baahar karne se pehle hi pataa chalata he ki tuuti hui he yaa uske hisse laapata hai
 This is a defective product and can be returned or replaced to the seller, regardless of what the seller's "return policy" is, even after the issue has been inaugurated after the "extended warranty" has expired Have happened Likewise, if the product is prematurely damaged, it may be that it was defective at the same time it was sold and could then be returned or replaced
 yadi vikreta varantee kaa apmaan karata he, to ek anubandh daawey ko adaalat main shuru kiya ja saktaa he
 In retail trade, a warranty generally refers to a product's guarantee of reliability under normal use conditions

 If after purchasing a product, it malfunctions within a specified period of time, then it is usually necessary for the manufacturer or distributor to replace, or repair, or return the item to the customer
 Such warranties typically involve "natural disaster", misuse by the owner, malicious destruction, commercial use, or anything else that has occurred outside of a mechanical fault in general personal use
 Most warranties do not include parts that are normally perishable and supplies that must be replaced after a certain period of time as they are normally used
 An extended warranty may be included in the purchase price, or optionally extended with an additional charge and may be extended annually and at the same time a "lifetime" in that product
 tritiy-paksh varantee pradaata, dheron utpaadon ke liye vaikalpik "vistaarit varantee" samjhauta pradaan karte hai, jise us utpaada ke liye beemaa kaa ek anubandh mana jaataa he
 Third parties are sold through various small, self-insured companies as well as by large, well-known store chains such as Best Buy and Circuit City
 As is the case with other types of insurance, companies gamble that products will be reliable and the warranty will be forgotten, or any claim will be settled cheaply
 Some third party companies provide their own assistance such as JTF Business Systems; These companies remove defective parts and send them back to the manufacturer for replacement
 vistaarit varantee ko aamtaur par nirmaataa ke madhyam se pradaan nahin kiya jaataa he, balki swatantra prashaskon ke madhyam se badhaayaa jaataa he
 In some circumstances it may serve the consumer's interest that the product is insured from a company that is outside the place of purchase and / or the place of service
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab ek auto varantee ko ek car dilarship ke madhyam se pradaan kiya jaataa he, to yah aamtaur par ek up-anubandhit varantee hoti he, jahaan vaahan kii marammat kaa sauda nimna dar par tay kiya jaataa he, jisamen aksar seva, shram or part ke saath nimna maanak par samjhauta kiya jaataa he
 Many times this type of warranty requires an unexpected expense at the time of repair, such as: - unexpected services provided outside the warranty terms - non-warranty portion and labor rate - paying the full balance while a reimbursement
 The arrangements have been made through the dealership / warranty claim offices
 Some mechanics and merchant service centers can postpone or replace necessary repairs
 Even dealerships have went not void warranty that came not under repair costs of their warranty or applicable general store rate
 ek beemaa seva samjhaute kaa *sachcha sahitya aapke vistaarit auto varantee kii gunvattta ko nirdhaarit karne kaa sabase mahatvapurn pahalu he
 a fully insured auto warranty, sometimes offered at wholesale rates or similar, may be worth the price difference, if any
 True literature is a contract written on your behalf, which must contain your name and your product ID number or vehicle ID number must be written on paper
 This is your true literature and whenever working with a contract there are always different "terms and Conditions", so make sure that you only deal with the companies that offer such service contracts
 This type of warranty is noticeably different than company subcontracted, internal, retail, and third-party warranty companies, simply because it will cover a higher shop rate and allow the customer to operate outside the dealership as well Will allow the selection of a different mechanic across the country

 "here, a warranty is more as an assurance," as the supplier warrants that all its employees working on the project will be subject to confidentiality agreements that include the supplier's ability to seek injunctive relief for infringement
 " agar abhyavedan or varantee sahi nahin hai yaa puri nahin kii jaati hai to aksar aisi sthiti ke liye vishisht upachaar yaa parinaam nirdisht hai
 For example, a seller may make representations and warranties that it has full ownership rights to the goods sold and there is no legal impediment to the seller regarding that transaction
 agar pataa chalata he ki vikreta ke paas purna adhikaar nahin he yaa vah kisi anya sahmati ke adheen he jisane bikri ko pratibandhit kiya or agar iske chalate khariddaar ke swaamitv main asar padataa he to yaa use uske liye vyay karnaa padataa he, to kharidaar ke paas samjhaute ke tahat vikreta se raahat paane kaa adhikaar he
 In these transactions, the parties usually demand representations and warranties about the issues they are concerned about
 abhyavedan or varantee banane ke parinaamon kii vajah se, aamtaur par partiyaan uski simaaon ko pratibandhit karne kii koshish karti hai
