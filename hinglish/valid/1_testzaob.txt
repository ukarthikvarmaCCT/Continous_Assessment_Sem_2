 Similar to newspapers published in Nepali, and English languages, the daily newspaper of the Newari language is also published, however today Nepal's most common national language is Nepali, which was also called Parvatiya "gorkhali" or Khas-kura
 nevaar, nevary yaa nepal bhashaa aagneyadeshiy tibet-varmi parivaar kii bhashaa maani jaati he - ek swariya shabdon ke anushaasan ke kaaran
 But Sanskrit grammar and syllabus have such a strong influence on this language that the first dictionary of the Newari language and grammar could be composed on the basis of the Newari translation of "panchatantra"
 sanskrit ke hi samaan nevary main bhi vibhaktiyon ke nishchit pratyay hai jaise chaturthi ke liye "yaat", shashthee ke liye "yagu", saptami ke liye "yaa" pratyay ityadi
 This language has an unmatched ability to form Newari words of Sanskrit words

 The following two Newari sentences will give some idea of the formation of this language- nevary : "jhansa jhansa disaan"; hindi- aaiai aaiai baithiai
 Normally in Newari it would say "promise sito" for "come sit"
 par vishesh sammaan ke saath jhansa kaa prayog hone se shaayad "jhansa dena" prayeg main jhansa kaa vipareet arth ho jaataa he

 Aldington writes: i was surprised to learn that Eliot admired something so popular and then said that if a contemporary poet, like Gray, knows his limits, then only he will focus on all the gifts of such poetry, Which he can get due to similar success
 " Eliot, who had some neurological disorders, was advised by doctors to rest

 While living there, Eliot worked on the poem 'westland' and probably depicted an early version of Ezra Pound when, after returning to London, Eliot traveled to Paris in November 1921
 vahaan vah pound ke mehmaan the
 Eliot traveled to Lausanne, Switzerland to seek treatment from Doctor Roger Vittoz, with Ottoline Morel advising him to visit this doctor; Viven had to stay outside the Sanatorium outside Paris at that time
 In Lausanne, Eliot produced a 19-page version of the poem
 ve 1922 kii janvari ke prarambh main main logen se laut aae
 Pound then made editorial comments on it and made several cuts to the manuscript
 Eliot later dedicated the poem to Pound
 aliot ne oktober 1922 main jon queen ko kavita kii pandulipi kaa draft bheja; jo janvari 1923 main neuyark main queen ke paas pahunch gaya
 After Quinn's death, the manuscript's draft was inherited by his sister Julia Anderson

 The first page of typescript contained 54 lines, which we can reread at the end of the second section, a Game of Chase
 is pej ko khud aliot dwaara halke se kaata gaya he
 Although there are similar signs to the adjustments made by Eliot and many commentaries have been made by Viven, the most important editorial changes have been made by Ezra Pound, who suggested several cuts to the poet in his poem
 'da typist home at tii time' khand mul rup se panchapadi padya ke niyamit padyon main tha, jisamen abaab kii chand yojana thi, grey kii elegi main isi skim kaa upyog kiya gaya tha, jiske bare main us samay aliot ke dimag main vichaar chal rahe the
 Pound said of this section of the draft "the verse is not as interesting when the poem warrants it

 In one version, at the beginning of 'the Fire Sermon', there was a lengthy section of a heroic couplet, copied by Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock
 isamen ek mahila freska kaa varnan diya gaya tha
 As Richard Almon describes it "instead of making her toilet like the Pope's Belinda, Fresca is going into it like Joyce's Bloom
 " ye panktiyaan hai: According to Alman "pound warns Eliot that the Clonky Pope improved the couplets and Joyce toilets, so no further rounds make any sense
" pound ne kuch choti kavitaaon ko isamen shaamil karnaa chaha jise aliot paanch khandon ke bich daalana chaahate the
 One of these is from where Eliot started the 'mourning'
 aliot kii patni, vivian ke anurodh par 'a game of ches' khand main se ek pankti ko hataa diya gaya: And we shall play a game of chess / The ivory men make company between us / Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door" yah khand jaahir taur par unke vaivaahik jivan par aadhaarit he or ve in panktiyon kaa khulaasa karti hui prathit hoti hai
 However, The "ivory Men" may mean something else to Eliot: in 1960, thirteen years after Vivian's death, he inserted the line in a copy sold to the Library of London
 disambar 1921 ke ant main kavita ke "janm" ko manaane ke liye aliot ko ek patr main pound ne 48 panktiyon kii ek kavita likhi

 Dial was an ideal choice for Scofield Thayer, a college friend of its co-owner and co-editor, due to his association with London for Dial magazine
 haalanki dial ne kavita ke liye $150 kii peshkash kii, aliot ne is baat par naaraazgi jaahir kii ki puure saal ke kaam kii keemat bahut kam hogi, kyonki ek or yogadanakarta unki ek choti kahani ke liye kaaphi keemat dene ke liye taiyaar tha
 The deal with Dial was almost certain, but with Pound's efforts the deal was finally settled, with Lava Eliot of $ 150 being selected for Dial Magazine's second annual award, as he provided his exclusive services
 2000 dollar kaa puraskaar diya gaya
 At the end of the summer in New York, Bonnie and Liveright signed an agreement with The Dial that the magazine would first print the poem in the United States, with the agreement to purchase 350 copies from Bonnie and Liveright at a discount
 She went
 boni or livrit ne aliot ke liye apni praarambhik bikri ko badhaane ke liye dial ke puraskaar ke prachaar kaa upyog kiya
 The poem was first published in Britain without an author's note, it was published for the first edition of The Literary, a literary magazine, edited by Eliot himself
 america main pehali baar kavita navambar 1922 main da dial patrika ke sanskaran main prakashit kii gayi 
 In December 1922, the poem was published in the book of Bonnie and Livrite
 sitambar 1923 main, aliot ke mitron leonord or virginia woolf ke dwaara sanchalit ek nijee press 'hogarth press' ne da west land ke pehle british sanskaran ko prakashit kiya, isamen virginia woolf ke dwaara 450 pratilipiyaan prakashit kii gayin
 The publication history of The West Land is described in a Donald Gallup documentary
 aliot kaa 1922 kaa vetan lloyds bank £ 500 tha, usne lagbhag £630 dial, boni or livrit tathaa hogarth press prakaashan ke saath banaaye the
 Eliot originally wanted to give the poem the title Hey Do the Police Different Voices
 kavita ke sanskaran main aliot kavita ke pehle do khandon ko switzaraland se laaye-'da bariyal of da ded' or 'a game of chess'- jo is sheershak ke antargat prakat hote hai
 These strange phrases are taken from Charles Dickens's novel Are Mutual Friends, in which the widow Betty Higdon tells her adopted son, "you might not think it but sloppy is a beautiful reader of a news paper
 Do the polis in Different Voices "
 This will help the reader understand that although the poem has many different voices, some critics believe that it has a single central consciousness
 is sheershak ko asweekrut karke aliot ne mahasoos kiya hoga ki vah tiracias ke bare main apane note main apane paatro kii tippaniyon ko behaal kiye hue hai
 In the end, Eliot chose the title 'the West Land'
 In his first note for the poem, he holds the title of Jessie L
 Weston's book From the Ritual to Romance on the Grail Ligand in which the Fisher King is wounded and as a result his land is barren
 raja ko thik karne ke liye or bhoomi ko phir se urvarak banane ke liye grel quester poochta he "aap kii samasya kya he"? The poem is mistakenly given the title "west Land"
 haalanki, ejra pound ko likhe gaye ek patr main aliot ne vinamratapurvak kaha ki sheershak "da" se shuru hona chahie
 The poem is preceded by a Latin and Greek inscription from The Setarikon of The Patronias
 angreji main yah nimnanusaar he: ""I saw with my own eyes the Sibyl of Cumae hanging in a jar, and when the boys said to her, Sibyl, what do you want? she replied i want to die 
" a 'dedication' is given after the inscription, according to Ezra Pound: il miglior fabbro "here Eliot is both quoting line 117 of Canto XXVI of Dante's Purgatorio, the second cantica of The Divine Comedy, where Dante defines the troubadour Arnaut Daniel as "the best smith of the mother tongue" and also Pound's title of chapter 2 of his The Spirit of Romance where he translated the phrase as "the better craftsman
" Written in the version, this version of the poem was introduced to Pound; later versions of it were included
 da west land ke paanch bhaagon ke sheershak hai: The text of the poem is followed by several pages of notes, which explain its metaphors, references and allusions
 inamen se kuch tippaniyan kavita ke vyakhya karne main madad karti hai, lekin kuch vivadaspad hai or adhikansh apaardarshee gadhy hai jin par koi tippaniyan nahin kii gayin hai
 These notes were added following Eliot's publisher's request, as they thought it appropriate to publish The West Land as a separate book
 aliot khud mul rup se da west land ke bare main kuch sawaalon kaa sangrah chaahate the yaa ve ek kavita ko paanch khandon main baantnaa chaahate the
 The style of Eliot's work illustrates the possibilities of dramatic monologue
 yah abhivyakti kam se kam je alfred prufroke ke da lav song ke rup main abhivyakt hoti he
 Eliot Music also enjoys the hall, and the popular form of entertainment is added to the poem, with songs composed by Gigfeld Follis, the composer of The Shakespearian Raga by Dev Stemper and Jean Buck
 yah sangeet faj ke praturup kaa anusaran karata he, jisamen theme main kai awaajen pravesh karti hai
 Above all, perhaps it is the unconnected nature of poetry, the way it suddenly shifts from one way to another, it moves between multiple voices, uses idioms of foreign languages, it is the most distinguishing feature of the genre of poetry
 
 dilachasp baat yah he ki jab aliot da west land likh rahe the, usee samay robert brij apni pehali nio-miltonic cilibics par kaam kar rahe the, is kavita kaa naam tha 'pier pool', isamen bhi kai alag alag bhashaaon se panktiyaan lee gayi thim
 Sources from which Eliot has taken his citations or whose work he has included are: Homer, Sophoclas, Petronias, Virgil, Ovid, St
 Augustine of Hippo, Dante Aligheri, William Shakespeare, Edmund Spencer, Gerrard de Narwal, Thomas Kidd , Geoffrey Chaucer, Thomas Middleton, John Webster, Joseph Konrad, John Milton, Andrew Marvel, Charles Boudlere, Richard Wegner, Oliver Goldsmith, Hermann Hosea, Aldous Huxley, Pau Verlaine, Walt Whitman and Bram Stoker
 Eliot has also made great use of mythological writings, in which many things have been taken from the Bible, The Book of Common Prayer, Hindu Great Aranyaka Upanishad and Buddha's Fire Sermon
 iske alaava, saanskrithik lekhanon se bhi tathy liye gaye hai jaise sar james freizer kii da golden bo or jesi weston kii from ritual tu romance se tathyon ko isamen shaamil kiya gaya he
 Eliot wrote in the original note that "not only the title but the poem's plan and symbols were suggested by Miss Jessie L
 Weston," but — thirty years later — Weston made many changes to the poem's notes, expressing her regret 
 
 west land ke alaava aliot ne kai pratikon kaa upyog kiya
 These include the symbols of the Fisher King, the Taro deck, the Perilas chapel, and the Grail Quest
 kavita kaa praarambhik sweekaarya mishrit prakaar kaa tha,; haalanki kai logon ne isaki saarvatrik niraashaa or ghrinaaspad takanic kaa chithran kiya, anya logon jaise epa el lucas ne pehali kavita kii jaanch kii, jabaki charles powel ne kaha yah sirf "kaagaj kii barbaadi he"
 Edmund Wilson's "the Poetry of Draft" for The Dial in 1922, many critics say that the poem has an effective structure that emphasizes emotional elements and biographical citations: Not only is life sterile and futile, but men have tasted its sterility and futility a thousand times before T

 In Ezekiel, God finally tells the saint that Israel will not change; Therefore their forms will end, their image will end and their cities will be ruined

 For fisheries, ponds ranging from 0
2 hectare to 5
0 hectare should be selected in which water should be filled for 8-9 months throughout the year
 talabon ko sadabahaar rakhane ke liye jal kii aapurti kaa saadhan hona chahie
 One to two meters of water must remain in the pond throughout the year
 talab aise kshetron main chune jaayen jo baadh se prabhavit na hote hon tathaa talab tak aasaani se pahunchaa ja sake
 Shredded and raised bumps, uneven bottom, lack of water inroads, chances of more water coming from other areas, etc
 The deficiencies are naturally found in the pond which can be rectified and removed
 can be done
 talab ko uchit aakaar-prakaar dene ke liye yadi kahi par tile aadi hon to unki mitti nikaal kaa bandhon par daal deni chahie
 Depth can be made uniform by removing soil from a location of low depth
 talab ke bandhen baadh str se oonche rakhane chahie
 Fake arrangement is necessary in the way of entry and exit of water so that fished fish cannot go out and undesirable fish cannot enter the pond
 talab kaa sudhaar kaary maah april va may tak avashya kara lenaa chahie jisase matsay paalan karne hetu samay mil sake
 Selection of suitable site is especially necessary for construction of new pond
 talab nirmaan ke liye mitti kii jal dhaaran kshamta va urvarakta ko chayan kaa aadhaar mana janaa chahie
 Ponds should not be built on the barren and wastelands
 jis mitti main amleeyta va kshariyata adhik ho us par bhi talab nirmit karaayaa janaa uchit nahin hota he
 Apart from this, the construction of a pond is not appropriate even in the soil soils because the water does not stop in the loamy ponds
 chikani mitti vaali bhoomi main talab kaa nirmaan sarvatha upyukt hota he
 This soil has high water holding capacity
 mitti kii pi-ech 6
5-8
0, argenic carbon 1 pratishat tathaa mitti main ret 40 pratishat, silt 30 pratishat va clay 30 pratishat hona chahie
 Soil testing must be done by the laboratories or other laboratories of the fisheries department before construction of the pond
 talab ke bandhe main donon ore ke dhalaanon main aadhaar va oonchai kaa anupaat saadharantaya 2:1 yaa 1
5:1 hona upyukt he
 The height of the bandha should be kept higher than the desired height from the beginning so that the soil would sit for a few years due to beating, its load and rainfall
 bandha kaa katnaa vanaspatiyon va ghaason ko lagaakar roka ja saktaa he
 For this, trees of banana, papaya etc
 can be planted on the outer slope of Bandha
 naye talab kaa nirmaan ek mahatvapurn kaary he tathaa is sambandh main matsay vibhaag ke adhikariyon kaa paraamarsh liya janaa chahie
 For high yields of fish, it is absolutely necessary to have suitable soil and water in the pond

 matsay paalan prarambh karne se purv yah atyadhik aavashyak he ki machhlee kaa beej daalane ke liye talab purna rup se upyukt ho
 Excessive aquatic plants in the pond are harmful for good fish yield
 yah paudhe pani kaa bahut bada bhaag ghere rahete hai jisamen machhlee ke ghoomane-phirane main asuvidha hoti he
 At the same time, they also create a barrier to the rays of the sun reaching inside the water
 parinamswaroop machhlee kaa prakritik bhojan utpann hona ruuk jaataa he or prakritik bhojan ke abhaav main machhlee kii vruddhi par vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Apart from this, these plants increase their potency by polluting the chemical substances found in the soil and the nutritional value of water is reduced
 machhlee pakadaney ke liye yadi jaal chalaaya jaay tab bhi yah paudhe rukawat daalate hai
 Generally, there are three types of aquatic plants in ponds - one with water surface such as hyacinth, lemna etc
, second root-like lotus etc
 and third water-immersed like hydrilla, najaj etc
 yadi talab main jaleey paudhon kii maatra kam ho to inhen jaal chalaakar yaa shramik lagaakar jad se ukhadkar nikaala ja saktaa he
 In case of excess aquatic vegetation, use of chemicals such as 2-4 d sodium salts, teficide, hexamar and Fernaxan in 8-10 kg per hectare of water area, water hyacinth, lotus etc
 are destroyed
 rasayanon ke prayog ke samay vishesh jaankaree matsay vibhaag ke karyaalayon se praapt kii jaani chahie
 Some submerged plants are the favorite food of grass carp fish, so they can be prevented by grasping grapes in the pond
 upyukt yahi he ki anaavashyak paudhon kaa unmoolan maanav-shakti se hi sunishchit kiya jaay
 In the old ponds many unnecessary animals like turtles, frogs, crabs and fishes like Sindhri, Puthiya, Chelwa etc
 and eater fishes are found for example Pichin, Tangen, Saul, Girai, Singhi, Mangur etc
 which are available to feed the food available in the pond
 Receive as food
 maansaahaari machhliyaan carp machhliyon ke bacchon ko kha jaati he jisase matsay paalan par vipareet prabhaav padataa he
 Therefore, their cleanliness is absolutely necessary
 avaanchhneeya machhliyon kaa nishkasana baar-baar jaal chalaakar yaa pani nikaal kar athwa mahua kii khali ke prayog dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 Mahu cake should be used in a pond with a depth of one meter of water in one hectare area at the rate of 25 quintals
 iske parinaam swaroop 6-8 ghanton main sari machhliyaan mar kar upar aa jaati hai jinhen jaal chalaakar ekatra karke bazaar main bechaa ja saktaa he
 Use of Mahu cake has dual effect for the pond
 vish ke alaava 15-20 din baad yah khaad kaa bhi kaary karti he jisase machhlee ke prakritik bhojan kaa utpaadan hota he
 Light alkaline water is beneficial for fisheries
 pani amleey athwa adhik kshareey nahin hona chahie
 Lime increases the alkalinity of water or balances the acidicity and alkalinity of water
 iske atirikt chuunaa machhliyon ko vibhinn paropjiviyon ke prabhaav se mukt rakhata he or talab kaa pani upyukt banaata he
 250 kg of lime in one hectare pond should be used one month before fish seed accumulation
 talab kii taiyaari main gobar kii khaad kii mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 This produces natural fish food
 gobar kii khaad, matsay beej sanchay se 15-20 din purv saamaanthya 10-20 ton prati he0 prati varsh 10 samaan masik kishton main prayog kii jaani chahie
 If the mahua cake has been poured in the preparation of the pond for the removal of undesirable fish, then there is no need to put the first installment of cow dung
 saamanyat: rasinic khaadon main uria 200 kilogram, singil super phosphate 250 ki0gra0 va murat of potash 40 ki0gra0 arthath kul mishran 490 ki0gra0 prati he0 prati varsh 10 samaan masik kishton main prayog kiya janaa chahie
 In this way, a mixture of chemical fertilizer of 49 kg per hectare per month should be put in the pond after 15 days of use of cow dung
 yadi talab ke pani kaa rang gaharaa haraa yaa gaharaa nila ho jaye to urvarkon kaa prayog tab tak band kar dena chahie jab tak pani kaa rang uchit avasthaa main na aa jaye
 Accumulation of pure seeds of such good fish species in the pond should be ensured that, while staying in the same aquatic environment, do not harm each other and consume the food available on different surfaces of the pond and grow rapidly
 bhartiya major carp machhliyon main katala, rohu evam nain tathaa videshi carp machhliyon main silver carp, grass carp evam kaaman carp kaa mishrit paalan vishesh laabhakaari hota he
 Pure seed of the best fish species is a basic requirement of fisheries

 Special emphasis is being given on the privatization of fish seed production with the objective of making Uttar Pradesh self-sufficient in the field of fish seed production and up to Rs 8
00 lakh for setting up a mini fish seed hatchery with a capacity of 10 million in the private sector
 Facility of loan and 10 percent government grant is permissible
 matsay paalak nijee kshetron main sthapit chote aakaar kii hechariyon se bhi shuddh beej praapt kar sakate hai
 Such fish species should be reared in the pond, which will grow rapidly by using the food available on each surface without harming each other by living together in an environment so that maximum fish production from a confined water area To be sure bhartiya major carp machhliyon main katala, rohu, nain tathaa videshi carp machhliyon main silver carp, grass carp va kaaman carp kaa mishrit paalan kaaphi laabhakaari hota he
 Before storing fish seed in the pond, it is worth noting that preparations have been completed and organic production has been done
 machhlee kaa prakritik bhojan jise planctan kehete hai paryaapt maatra main uplabdh hona chahie
 The availability of one milliliter of plant in 50 liters of water in the pond indicates that fish seed can be stored
 ek he0 jal kshetra main 50 mi0me0 aakaar se kam kaa 10,000 matsay beej tathaa 50 mi0me0 se adhik aakaar kii 5000 angulikaayen sanchit kii jaani chahie
 If six types of domestic and foreign carp fishes are being mixed, then the ratio of katla 20 percent silver carp 10 percent, rohu 30 percent, grass carp 10 percent, nan 15 percent and common carp 15 percent is appropriate
 yadi silver carp va grass carp machhliyon kaa paalan nahin kiya ja rahaa he or 4 prakaar kii machhliyaan paali ja rahi hai to sanchay anupaat katala 40 pratishat, rohu 30 pratishat, nain 15 pratishat va kaaman carp 15 pratishat hona laabhakaari hota he
 If only Indian major carp fishes are being reared then the ratio of katla 40 percent, rohu 30 percent, nan 30 percent should be
 kaaman carp machhlee kaa beej march, april va may main tathaa anya carp machhliyon kaa beej july, agast, sitambar main praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 For high yields of fish, it is absolutely necessary to have suitable soil and water in the pond
 aisi mitti jisamen sand 40 pratishat tak, silt 30 pratishat tathaa clay 30 pratishat ho evam pi-ech 6

 Refrigerator is a home-use device that keeps vegetables and food items cold and keeps them from getting spoiled quickly
 gharelu upyog ke liye thodi maatra main khaadya padaartho ko thanda rakhane ke nimitt 1917 i

 Initially, only gas powered devices were made, but now some years electric powered refrigerators have become popular
 aajkal sab prakaar ke prashithitron kii almariyaan dekhne main ek si hi lagati hai
 They are coated with a layer of porcelain and a thick effluent coating on the outside
 bhinn bhinn maadlon kii keemat ke anusaar prashithitr kii deevaaron main laga ooshmaarodhak 2 se 4 inch tak motaa hota he
 The thicker the insulator, the more effective it will be, because the heat of most of the atmosphere is passed through the walls into the food
 prayek prashithitr main rakhe khadyapadartho ko thanda rakhane kaa kaam kisi prasheetak madhyam kii bhautik dasha main parivartan ke dwaara hota he
 Therefore, a good refrigerant must have the following qualities: ammonia gas, sulfur doiaksaide, carbon dioxide, dychlor-dyphlor-mithen pramukh gaisen hai, jinka upyog prashithan main hota he
 The principle of refrigerators operated only by ice and by the device is virtually the same, because in both of them the heat of the food is only absorbed by the physical change of the medium
 pehle main to barf pighalkar pani ban jaataa he, or duusare main prasheetak drav, yantra ke dwaara gas se parinat ho jaataa he
 Multifunctional refrigerators are made in such a way that air is transported from the underside of the ice blocks and the ice is at fault
 at: jab tak khaadya kaksh band rahata he uskaa taap 60 se 80 ke bich rahata he, chaahe barf kii silli kitni hi patali ho jaae
 Thus a sill lasts for 4-5 days
 svachlit prakaar ke yantric prashithitr do prakaar ke hote hai, ek to sampeden ke siddhant par ore duusare avasorana ke siddhant par chalanevaale
 In the closed systems of these two, the refrigerant-medium keeps transporting

 There is also a heating instrument called by which the temperature of the food can be controlled
 sampeden ke siddhant par chalanevaale prasheetak yantron main athwa ashwashakti kii motor, yantra ke kriyachakra kaa aarambh karne ke liye lagaai jaati he, jiske dwaara sulfur dioxide athwa dochlordiflor mithen ke jaise gasiy prasheetak-madhyam vaashpitra main se sanghanan kundaliyon main prerit kiye jate hai
 Then one of these passes through the special valve and returns to the evaporator
 ye kapaat bhi do prakaar ke hote hai
 One is the diffusion valve, by which the condensed refrigerant enters the evaporator, disintegrating as a fine spray and causing it to form, in part, the vapor
 duusare prakaar kaa plav kapaat he, jo vaashpitra ke bheetar kaaphi maatra main prasheetak-drav ikattha hone par apana kaam karata he or tabhi kriyachakra kaa punaravartan hota he
 In refrigerators operating on the principle of absorption, ammonia gas easily dissolves in cold water and also escapes easily when the water is heated
 at: pani ko garam karne ke liye tel yaa gas kii jwaala kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 When separated from the water, the ammonia gas is liquefied in the condensation coils and flows into the evaporator, where the pressure of the condenser through hydrogen is reduced so much that the liquid starts evaporating again
 phir, vaashpitra se hydrogen or ammonia gas kaa mishran avasorak prakoshth main jyonhi pahunchataa he, usamen pani kii ek baarik phuhaar milti he
 This causes the ammonia gas to dissolve in water and return to the insoluble hydrogen vapor in water
 idhar ammonium hydroxide vashpajanitr main aakar kriyachakra ko pun: chaalu kar detaa he
 Due to the constant exchange of heat and coolness in this type of device, its design becomes very complicated, but the functionality of the device remains good

 The poetry of Gregory Corso and Bob Kauffman reveals the effects of surrealist poetry and its random juxtaposition of separate images with images like its dreams, and this can also be seen in a more subtle way in Ginsberg's poetry

 His real name was 'rustom Khurshedji Karanjia'

 The above lines fall on the lips as soon as we remember the fearless great Russian Karanjia of the journalistic world
 ek patrkaar bandhu ne roosi ko jab uparokt panktiyaan sunai to roosi karanjia kaa mukhmandal muskaan kii jhini abha se damak uthaa tha
 The people sitting around him were amazed - seeing the image of his shape
 roosi karanjia panchanwe basant dekh chuke the
 He had shown to the world what are the values of fearless and independent journalism, how many and what aspects are there and their might
 janaa to tha hi unhen, so chale gaye, kintu apni jo viraasat chhod gaye us par, unke jate hi, ek chunautibachak prashn chinh khadaa ho gaya he- he koi sher kii chaativala vir is media main, jo roosi karanjia ko aage baadha sake? roosi karanjia bharat main tebolide patrakarita ke janak maane jate hai
 In true sense, he was the first investigative journalist of the country
 aise samay jab saare akhbaar 'vyavastha patr' kaa chola dhaaran kar rahe the, karanjia kaa akhbaar vyavastha ko bepard kar rahaa tha
 The system - the black exploits of men exposed by Karanjia, made a million attempts to call their investigative journalism as 'yellow journalism'
 kintu unka koi asar nahin padaa- na karanjia kii sehat par na 'blitj' ke tewaron-takat par, na hi pathakon ke chaav par
 'blitz' itself means invasion, attack, climb
 vyavastha kaa chaahe jo bhi ang athwa avyab ho, 'blitj' kaa naam sunate hi khauf lagata tha
 'blitz' was the first choice of newspaper readers
 roosi karanjia ne 'blitj' saptahik ke nirbhik evam swatantra charitra ko kabhi vichlit yaa kalankit nahi hone diya
 He considered 'indian Express' editor 'frank Mores' as his mentor
 mores ke nidhan par unhone kaha tha- frank kii rachana ke baad bhagwan ne apana sancha tod diya
 This comment is also 100 percent accurate for Karanjia himself
 roosi apane samay ke sabase mahaan sampadak the, sabase sajjan or sabase udaar vyakti bhi
 He was extremely sensitive to his country

 In order to refine and regularize the present form of Sanskrit language, Panini incorporated various components and components of the language such as phonetics, name, designation, verb, prefix, prefix, sentence, gender, etc
 and their interrelations in the Ashtadhyayi
 is
 ashtaadhi main 32 paad hai jo aath adhyyon me samaan rup se vibhakt hai In this important book of grammar, Panini has given a comprehensive and thorough discussion of the huge collection of the divisive-dominated Sanskrit language in about 4000 sutras, which are divided into eight chapters
 tatkaaleen samaaj me lekhan saamagree kii dushprapyata ko dhyaan main rakhte hue panini ne vyakaran ko smritigamya banane ke liye sutara style kii sahaayta lee he
 Again, Panini has used many tools from his predecessor grammar as well as himself, to make the discussion very brief, of which the Shivasutra or Maheshwar Sutras are the most important
 maheshwar sutron kii utpatti bhagwaan nataraj ke dwaara kiye gayi tandav nrity se maani gayi he
 That is to say, "on the expiration of the dance, Nataraj played the damper nine times for the attainment and fulfillment of the wishes of the Sanakadi sages
 is prakaar chaudaa shivasutron kaa ye jaal prakat huyi
 " damru ke chaudaa baar bajaane se chaudaa sutron ke rup main dhvaniyaan nikali, inhen dhvaniyon se vyakaran kaa prakaatya hua
 That is why Lord Nataraja, the originator of grammar formulas, is considered
 prasiddhi he ki maharishi panini ne in sutron ko devadhidev shiv ke aashirwad se praapt kiya jo ki panineey sanskrit vyakaran kaa aadhaar bana
 The total number of Maheshwar Sutras is 14 which are as follows: 1

 Light uparyuktt 14 sutron main sanskrit bhashaa ke varnon ko ek vishisht prakaar se sanyojit kiya gaya he
 As a result, whenever Pāिini needs to use any particular group of characters in the interpretation of words or rules, they take those letters from the Maheshwar Sutras in an abbreviated form
 maheshwar sutron ko isi kaaran ‘pratyaahaar vidhayak’ sutara bhi kehete hai
 His method of making pratihar and his multiple uses in Sanskrit grammar is further shown
 in 14 sutron main sanskrit bhashaa ke samast varnon ko samavesh kiya gaya he
 In the first 4 sutras, vowel characters and remaining 10 sutra consonant characters are counted
 sankshep main swar varnon ko ach evam vyanjan varnon ko hal kaha jaataa he
 Good and light are also pratyahar
 pratyaahaar kaa arth hota he – sankshipt kathan
 Panini has instructed the method of making pratyahara by the 'adirantyen Saheta' sutra, the 71st formula of the first foot of the first chapter of Ashtadhyayi
 adirantyen saheta : aadi varna antim it varna ke saath milakar pratyaahaar banaata he jo aadi varna evam itsanjyak antim varna ke purv aae hue varnon kaa samshti rup main bodh karaata he
 Example: Ach = Aa Pratihar is made by using the initial letter 'A' of the first Maheshwar Sutra 'aiun' with the last letter 'A' of the fourth sutra 'aiuch'
 yah ach pratyaahaar apane aadi akshar ‘a’ se lekar itsanjyak ch ke purv aane vaale ou paryant sabhi aksharon kaa bodh karaata he
 Hence, ach = a i u ri e i o ou
 Similarly, the attainment of light pratyahar is achieved by mixing the initial letter of the 5th sutra hayavart with the last letter of the 14th sutra hal
 faltah, In all the above 14 sutras, Panini has given the last letter as it
 it sangya hone se in antim varnon kaa upyog pratyaahaar banane ke liye keval anubandh hetu kiya jaataa he, lekin vyakaraniya prakriya me inaki gananaa nahi kii jaati he arthath inkaa prayog nahi hota he

 unhen mere brother kii dulhan ke nirdesan ke liye janaa jaataa he
 When many people of the community try to fulfill the same purpose simultaneously, it is a collective event called 'janariti'
 yah ‘janariti’ ek peedi se duusari peedi ko hastaantarit hoti rahati he is prakaar hastaantarit hone ke dauraan ise samooh kii adhikadhik abhimati praapt hoti jaati he, kyonki prayek peedi kaa safal anubhav ise or bhi drudh bana detaa he, yahi 'pratha' he
 Sometimes humans follow these practices similar to laws
 kyonki use samaaj kaa bhay hota he, use bhay hota he lokaninda kaa or use bhay hota he saamaajik bahishkaar kaa
 As is evident from the above discussion, only organized, firm demographics that are passed on from generation to generation, recognized by society, are called 'practices'
 pratha vastav main saamaajik kriya karne kii, sthapit va maanya vidhi he
 People believe this because most of the people of the society have been working or behaving according to the same method for a long time
 is prakaar ‘pratha’, ‘janariti’ kaa hi ek praudh rup he, jiske saath saamaajik abhimati yaa sweekruti judi hui hoti he
 The practice is related to the folk customs used for a long time
 duusare shabdon main, iske antargat ve kriyaayein aati hai, jinhen pidiyon se sweekaar kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Due to these practices, we feel some hesitation in performing new activities
 vyakti kaa vyavhaar prathaon se prabhavit hota he
 According to maciver and Page, pro boguards ne prathaon or paramparaon ko ek hi maanate hue unki paribhaasha dete hue kaha he, Sapirne has also written, parantu pro boguardeski uparokt paribhaasha se yah na samaj lenaa chahie ki pratha or parampara ek hi hai
 In fact there is enough variation among them
 in donon ke antar ko spasht karte hue ross ne likhaa he ki, is
 ’’ To clarify the nature of the practice, it is necessary to know its characteristics- ‘pratha’ kaa aadhaar samaaj he, par ise jaanboojhkar nahin banaaya jaataa, apitu saamaajik antalakriya ke dauraan iskaa vikaas hota he
 The 'practice' is the genetics which is passed on from generation to generation
 iskaa paalan keval isliye kiya jaataa he ki ek lambe samay se anek vyakti iskaa paalan karte aa rahe hai
 'practices' are practices of behavior that go on for many generations and thus gain stability in the group
 iske peeche samooh yaa samaaj kii adhikadhik abhimati hoti he
 In fact, the successful experience of many generations makes it strong
 ‘pratha’ roodhiwaadee hoti he, is kaaran ise saralata se badla nahin ja saktaa or parivartan kii gati bahut hi dhimi hoti he
 There is no organization or power to punish those who create, practice and break the 'custom'
 samaaj hi ise janm detaa or lagu karata he
 The ability to control the behavior of every type of human being is very large in practices
 maanav ke jivan main, bachapan se lekar mrityukaal tak, inkaa prabhaav padataa rahata he
 To clarify the nature of the practice, Zinsburg considered it necessary to distinguish between 'practice' and 'habit'
 aapane likhaa he ki, According to Zinsberg, in order to understand the nature of the practice well, the difference between 'fashion' and 'fashion' has to be understood
 kabhi-kabhi yah kaha jaataa he ki fishan kriya kii taatkaalik samanta he; arthath iske prabhaav se prayek vyakti vahi karata he jo har doosraa aadmi kar rahaa he; or is tarah yah anukaran par aadhaarit hota he
 But 'practice' is a gradual equality of action
 duusare shabdon main, pratha ke anusaar kaam karte hue prayek vyakti vahi karata he jo sadaiv se kiya jaataa rahaa he or is tarah pratha anivaary rup se aadat par aadhaarit hoti he
 But there is a much more important difference between the two
 sarvapratham- pratha, samaaj kii sadaa bani rahane vaali moulik aavashyaktaaon se sambandhit maaloom padati he; jabaki fishan kaa prabhaav jivan ke kam maarmik or kam saamaanya kshetron main dikhaai detaa he
 Fashion is essentially dynamic and dynamic
 vastav main fishan baar-baar hone vaale parivartanon kaa ek silsilaa hota he or praayah anukaran or naveenta isaki visheshta hoti he
 In contrast, the practice is essentially static and uninterrupted
 or usamen parivartan sadaiv dhime-dhime hi hota he
 There is no doubt that there are some fashions that do not change, but when this happens, they do not really remain fashion, but become custom
 duusare shabdon main, unako ateet or vartmaan donon kaa hi sammaan praapt hota he
 The second thing is that motivational elements are different in practice and fashion
 


 pratha kaa anusaran isliye hota he ki bhootkaal main praayah iskaa anusaran hua he, jabaki fishan kaa isliye ki vartmaan main uskaa anusaran ho rahaa he
 In addition, fashion is a way of symbolizing innovation, and its essential basis is found in a fervent desire to separate oneself from the other
 iske vipareet, pratha kaa jor bahut‘ kuch is tathy par aadhaarit hota he ki iske dwaara samaaj naveenta ke khataron se apana bachaav kar saktaa he
 That is, the basis of practice is the desire to make oneself similar to the past and archaic of others
 saadharantaya prathaon or janaritiyon ko ek hi mana jaataa he
 But in reality these two are different views
 prathaen vastav main janaritiyaan na hokar unka hi viksit rup hai
 No group behavior can take the form of practice until it has received social acceptance
 is rup main janaritiyon ko samuhik vyavhaar kaa pratham pag kaha ja saktaa he or prathaon ko du saraa pag
 In addition, the practices are also more permanent and powerful than the generals
 itnaa hi nahin, saamaajik niyantran ke ek saadhan ke rup main, prathaon kaa mahatv janaritiyon se kahin adhik badhkar hai
 The practice does not originate in a single or single day
 kisi bhi pratha kaa vikaas dhire-dhire or kaaphi samay main hota he
 Many new requirements come before human beings in daily life
 inamen se kuch aisi hoti hai jo samooh ke adhiktar logon se sambandhit hoti hai
 Therefore, an attempt is made to find the means to fulfill such common needs
 yah saadhan sarvapratham ek vichaar yaa avadharana ke rup main ek vyakti ke dimag main aata he
 a person acts according to this idea and tries to know whether that need can be met in that way
 yadi vah apane is prayaas main safal hota he to bhavishya main bhi waisi hi aavashyaktaa aa padane par use vah baar-baar doharaata he
 Repeating it becomes her personal habit
 jab duusare log pratham vyakti ke safal vyavhaar yaa kriya kii vidhi ko dekhte hai; to ve bhi us vidhi ko apana lete hai
 When that method of behavior spreads in the society, it is called Janariti
 jab janariti ek peedi se duusari peedi ko hastaantarit hoti rahati he to use pratha kehete hai
 Thus an idea leads to the development or development of a personal habit, a personal habit to genetics, and genetics to practice
 is prakaar pratha kii utpatti main ateet or vartmaan donon kaa hi yogadan rahata he
 Wunt wrote, yah kathan shri ginsburg ke anusaar is arth main sahi he ki rivaaj ek sammilit sristi or hajaaron antalakriyaaon kii upaj hota he
 But it should not be understood that behind the practice there exists the existence of a great soul or the common soul of society
 antim rup main kisi vyaktigat aadat ke saath anya vyaktigat aadaton ke milane se hi pratha kaa janm hota he
 The result of each of them being influenced by the other and influencing the other is that in the end its form becomes stable as a combined product
 isi ko ham pratha kehete hai
 As Hobhouse has written - saamaajik jivan main pratha ke mahatv ko kisi bhi rup main asweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In fact, in primitive or simple societies, they have more importance than state law
 iskaa ek vishesh kaaran he or vah yah he ki saral samaajon main vyaktiyon kaa jivan atyadhik roodhiwaadee hota he, saath hi dharm dwaara atyadhik prabhavit hota he
 Therefore, they are not able to violate the practice in any way
 iske atirikt, chunki pratha peedi-dar-peedi hastaantarit hoti rahati he, atah inkaa ulanghan purvajon kaa apmaan mana jaataa he
 This importance of the practice will become even more clear with the following discussion
 main asafal rahen or isiilie unke dwaara saamaajik aavashyaktaaon kii purti na ho
 Such practices often obstruct the progress of society
 parantu kuch anupayogi prathaon kaa chalan dekhakar hamen is bhram main nahin padana chahie ki prathaen arthhin va nirarthak hoti hai
 Practices have great importance in social control
 prathaen vyakti ke vyavhaaron ko kaaphi seemaa tak niyantrit karti hai
 Although there is no such legal power behind which individuals can be pressurized to get them persuaded, yet human beings are not able to violate the practices for fear of social reproach
 prathaen chunki pichhali pidiyon kaa safal anubhav hoti hai, atah vyakti inhen jaldi hi maan letaa he kyonki nae vyavhaaron ko karne main use hichkichaahat tathaa bhay kii anubhuti bhi hoti he
 Practices have more impact than laws in primitive and simple societies
 iskaa ek vishesh kaaran yah he ki is prakaar ke samaajon main vyaktiyon kaa jivan atyadhik roodhiwaadee hota he, saath hi dharm dwaara adhik prabhavit hota he
 Therefore, they are not able to violate the practice in any way
 iske atirikt, chunki prathaen peedi-dar-peedi hastaantarit hoti hai, atah inkaa ulanghan purvajon kaa apmaan mana jaataa he
 Shakespeare called the practices 'cruel practices', Montane the 'angry and traitorous school-masterney', Bacon called 'the chief judge of man's life' and Locke 'greater power than nature' is
 ginsburg ne prathaon kii saamaajik niyantran main bhoomika ke varnan kii vyakhya karte hue likhaa he, That is why practices gain social consensus and it is on this that they control and conduct the behavior of the person and thus help in social control
 pracheen samaaj chota or saral hota tha or prayek vyakti ek-du saare ko bahut-kuch vyaktigat rup se jaanata-pahachaanata tha
 Also, there was neither rapid change in social life nor serious social problems
 isliye prathaon ke dwaara hi saamaajik niyantran kaa kaary saralata se ho jaataa tha
 But the practices in modern society are totally inadequate and social control only by them is impossible today
 iske chaar pramukh kaaran hai- Thus it is clear that the practices are inadequate for modern society and the whole work of social control cannot be done by them at all; This is why today the importance of practices is decreasing day by day and the importance of law is increasing

 Bodhisattva is a Marathi play composed by the famous historian DD Kaushambi
 yah granth prathamatya 1945 main prakashit hua tha
 It was written by Dattatreya Balakrishna Kalelkar
 is naatak main chaar ank hai
 'prince Siddharth murdered in the night after seeing the elderly, the sick, the dead and the ascetic', assuming this to be imaginary or projectile, Kosambi presented the Tripitaka Samat incident in a very interesting way through this play
 anya granthon main bhi unhone shaakyon va coliyon ke rajyon ke bich bahane vaali rohinee nadi ke jal se upasthit vivaad ko siddharth kumaar ke ghar chhodane kaa aitihaasik kaaran man or use anek pramaanon se siddh bhi kiya
 But even then, as the evidence presented by himself appeared to be incomplete, he wrote a small drama of 'bodhisattva' salt four digits in order to present this phenomenon more clearly, confirmed by the evidence of Tripitaka itself
 is naatak main unhone tripitak sammat siddharthabhinishkaraman kii karneebhoot ghatana ko atyant rochakata se upasthaapit kiya

 Prafulla Gadpal translated this play from Marathi into Sanskrit, published in 2013 from Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthanam
