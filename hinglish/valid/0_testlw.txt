 At its peak was a parasol symbolizing the high honor given to the monument
 
 The stupa occupies one place in the second century BC
 Was ransacked
 yah ghatana shunga samraat pushyamitra shunga ke utthan se jodakar dekhi jaati he
 It is believed that Pushyamitra may have demolished the stupa and later, his son Agnimitra rebuilt it
 
 In the last years of the Sunga dynasty, the original form of the stupa was almost doubled from the stone rocks

 With this, they know at what time in the direction of the visionary the constellation will appear
 prekshan ke kisi ek sthaan se akaash main jis sthaan par koi tara dikhaai pasta he, agali raat usee nakshatra-samay par lagbhag usee disha main milegaa
 Just as the Sun and Moon are seen rising in the East and setting in the West, similarly other constellations also appear
 'saura samay' or 'nakshatra samay' dono hi prithvi kii apni dhruviya aksh par ghurnan gati kii niyamitata par aadhaarit hai
 The knowledge of time is taken from the visible positions of the Sun
 saamanyat: suryoday se suryaast tak din tathaa suryaast se pun: suryoday tak raatri hoti hai, kintu tithigananaa ke liye din raat milakar din kehalaate hai
 a revision of the midpoint of the post-meridian circle by the Sun at a place is called a 'visible day', and a revision relative to a stationary constellation of the Sun is called a 'sidereal day'
 yah nakshatra roodhi ke anusaar maap kaa aadi bindu, arthath krantivrutt tathaa vishuvat vrutt kaa vasant sampaat bindu liya jaataa he
 Although the sidereal day is stationary, it is not useful for our behavior, because this view is 3 minutes 53 seconds less than the day
 drishy din kaa maan sadaa ek sa nahin rahata
 Therefore, it is difficult to tell the time of the sun from a watch
 iske do kaaran hai : ek to surya kii spasht gati sadaa ek si nahin rahati, duusare spasht surya krantivrutt main chalata dikhaai detaa he
 We need such a sun to make a timetable device, which always moves in equinoctial at a moderate speed
 aise surya ko jyotishi log jyotish-madhya-surya athwa keval madhya surya kehete hai
 Bhaskaracharya has called the difference between the equator and the middle sun of the ecliptic, the difference between the Udayantra and the ecliptic, the middle sun and the apparent sun
 yadi jyotish-madhya surya main udayantar tathaa bhujaantar sanskaar kar den, to vah drishy surya ho jayega
 In modern terminology, simultaneous rites of Udayantar and Bhujantar are called time equations
 yah hamaari ghadiyon ke samay tathaa drishy surya ke samay ke antar ke tulya hota he
 Time reviewer can be calculated only per day by mathematics
 aajkal prakashit honevaale navik panchang main, iskaa pratidin kaa maan diya rahata he
 Thus we can find the time of visible sun whenever we want with our watches
 iskaa jyotish main bahut upyog hota he
 Inversely: We can fix the time of our clocks by observing the skipping of the post-meteorological point of the Sun, adding or subtracting the time criterion in it, and finding the actual mean-sun time
 ham hamane samay naapane ke liye aadhunik ghadiyaan bataayin, tab yah paaya gaya ki sardi tathaa garmi ke kaaran ghadiyon ke dhaatunirmit purjon ke sikudne tathaa failane ke kaaran ye ghadiyaan thik samay nahin deteen
 Now we had this problem, how do we know the subtle impurities of our mechanical watches? Although we could know the inaccuracy of our clocks by the method of skipping the Sun's vertical meridian, the perforation of the sun's post-meteor skipping itself is somewhat unique and there is a greater possibility of the observer's personal error due to the larger image of the Sun
 duusari kathinaayee yah thi ki hamaari madhya-surya-ghadi ke samay kaa akashiya pindon kii sthiti se koi pratyaksh sambandh na tha
 The constellation clock was created to fill this gap, which indicated the constellation time
 iske 24 ghante prithvi kii apane aksh kii ek parikrama ke, athwa vasantapaat bindu ke urdhv yamyottar bindu kii ek parikrama ke, samay ke tulya hote hai
 Around 21 March, the spring point skips vertically with our visible sun
 us samay nakshatra ghadi kaa samay shunya ghanta, shunya minutes, shunya second hota he
 It is 12 in our time
 duusare din dopaher ko nakshatra ghadi kaa samay 4 minute hoga
 On any other fixed day, we can change the mean-sun time in proportion to the nakshatra even, or the nakshatra time to mean sun time
 navik panchangon main is prakaar ke samayparivartan kii saraniyan di rahati hai
 Thus, if we find a sidereal clock giving pure time, then we can keep the time of our mean clock pure
 yadhyapi nakshatra ghadi bhi yantric hoti he tathaa usamen bhi yantric truti ho jaati he, tathaapi ise pratidin shuddh kiya ja saktaa he, kyonki iskaa akashiya pindon kii sthiti se pratyaksh sambandh he
 It goes like this: The angle that a planet and star makes from the posterior meridian point towards Pachim on the celestial pole is called a kalakone
 is prakaar nakshatra sam basantpaat kaa kalkon he
 The equinox of a star or planet is determined by its equinoctial distance from spring to the sun or stars, with the help of an instrument called chronometer, the constellation of their post-mortem time is known
 nakshatra ghadi se milakar, yamyottar yantra ke doordarshee main grah yaa taare ke bedh ke nakshatra samay ko kronometer kaa switch dabaakar jaan liya jaataa he
 From this time, the time that is obtained when mechanical impurities are removed is the time of skipping the vertical point of the meridian of the planet or star
 yadi nakshatra padi thik he, to yah grah yaa taare ke vishuvaansh ke tulya hoga or antar ghadi kii ashuddhi he
 In this way, the mean Sun clocks are purified by keeping the constellation clock pure
 yamyottar yantra dwaara vedh karne main vyaktigat ashuddhi kii adhik sambhaavna he
 Therefore, the constellation time of the post-skipping time of stars is also known from the camera with fixed telescopes
 is prakaar yadhyapi madhya samay kii ghadiyon ko thik rakhaa jaataa he, tathaapi unamem dainik sanshodhan karnaa ek samasya thi
 Therefore nowadays seconds of indicator devices are made from crystals of quartz
 quartz ke crystalon par ushnata kaa prabhaav bahut kam padataa he
 Hence these watches give very pure time
 inamen second ke hajaarwein bhaag tak kii ashuddhi jaani ja sakati he
 Also, this clock can be mixed by listening to the time indicators, pips, of the clocks placed at other stations of that kind, and the time indicator pips can also be sent
 is prakaar kii ek ghadi kaashi kii prastaavit, rajkeey sanskrit kaalaj vedhashala ke liye san 1953 main mangvaai gai thi, jo ab rajkeey vedhashala nainital main he
 By correcting the main clocks of the country with this type of clocks, all the mean solar clocks are kept properly by the "peep" at the time of radio
 aajkal prayek desh main madhyaraatri ke samay ko shunya maanakar, vahiin se din kaa prarambh maanate hai
 24 hours a day are divided into two 12 hours, from 12 noon to 12 hours in the morning, and from 12 noon to 12 noon in the afternoon
 hamaari ghadiyaan yaheen samay batalaati hai
 These 24 hours are called civil days
 din main 24 ghante, 1 ghante main 60 minutes tathaa ek minute main 60 second hote hai
 The English measurement system of science is the unit of time in feet seconds and the international system in centimeters grams seconds
 bhura bouna yaa brown dwarf brahmand main aisi vastu ko kaha jaataa he jo aakaar main gas daanav grahon or taron ke darmyaan kaa sthaan rakhti hai
 Brown dwarfs are made of gas, with hydrogen and hilium predominant
 bhure bunon kaa aakaar taron se chota hota he or unamem itnaa gurutvkarshan nahin hota ke unamem hydrogen gas ke parmaanuon ke kuchle jane se nabhikeey sanlayan kii prakriya shuru ho, lekin kuch anya baari tatwon kaa sanyalan armbh avashya ho jaataa he - jaise kii duterium or lithium kaa
 There is absolutely no combination of gas demon planets
 vaigyanikon main kuch vivaad he ke kis aakaar par vaastu gas daanav nahin rahati or bhura bouna ban jaati he or kis aakaar par tara ban jaati he
 It is estimated that brown dwarf becomes 13 times larger than Jupiter and becomes star when it is 75 times more mass
 taare bhi gas daanvon kii tarah gas ke bane hote hai, lekin taare itane bade hote hai ke unamem maujuud hydrogen gas ke parmaanu gurutvkarshan ke dabaav se nabhikeey sanlayan kii prakriya ke zariye milakar helium bananaa shuru kar dete hai
 a lot of energy and light is produced in this connection and this is the source of the light emanating from the stars
 bhure bunon main itnaa dabaav nahin lekin unamem jo anya tatwon kaa sanyalan hota he mana jaataa he ke us se un main dhimaa bhure rang kaa prakaash aa jaataa he
 Therefore they are called brown dwarfs

 maitrey, metteyya, yaa matheri, buddha manyataon ke anusaar bhavishya ke buddha hai
 His name Ajit is also mentioned in some Buddhist texts, such as the Amitabha Sutra and the Siddharmapundariksa Sutra
 buddha paramparaon ke anusaar, maitrey ek bodhisattva hai jo prithvi par bhavishya main avatarit honge or buddhatv praapt karenge tathaa vishuddh dharm kii shiksha denge
 According to the texts, Maitreya will be the successor of the present Buddha, Gautama Buddha
 maitrey ke aagaman kii bhavishyavaanee ek aise samay main inke aane kii baat kahati he jab dharti ke log dharm ko vismrit kar chuke honge
 This concept of Buddhist tradition has also acquired a place in the tales of many other religions over time
 "maitrey" shabd sanskrit ke "mitra" athwa "mitrataa" se niklaa he
 In the Pali language it is "mettay" and finds mention in the Pali branch's Deepa Nikha and Buddhavansha
 pali shakha ke adhiktar hisse prashnottar ke rup main milte hai, haalaanki, yah sutt bilkul hi alag sandarbhon main shishyon se vaarta karte hue miltaa he
 This is why some scholars are of the opinion that it may have been added later or changed
 uttari bharat main pehali sadi ke aasapaas apane utkarsh par rahi greek-buddha gandhar kala main maitrey ek bahuprachlit vishay ke rup main nirupit kiye gaye hai
 Maitreya is depicted in various forms with Gautama Buddha, and the representation of Gautama and Maitreya has been a major theme in these works
 chauthi se chhathin shatabdi ke kaal main china main gautam buddha or maitrey buddha ke ek duusare ke samanaarthi ke rup main bhi prayog milte hai haalaanki in donon ke chini nirupan kii purna vyakhya or samiksha abhi tak nahin hui he
 An example of the representation of Maitreya Buddha is found from Qingzhou, whose period has been set to 529 AD
 yah mana jaataa he ki maitrey kii dharmik pratishtha lagbhag usee kaal main hui jab amitabh kii pratishtha, lagbhag teesri sadi main, hui
 Maitreya Buddha is usually depicted in a seated state
 unhen singhaasana par, yaa to donon paanv dharti par rakhe hue athwa ek paanv ghutane se muda hua duusare paanv par rakhe hue, apane samay kii pratiksha main baitha hua nirupit kiya jaataa he
 As a Bodhisattva, he should be displayed in an upright posture and equipped with jewelery
 kintu yah kuch hi gandhar kala kii murtiyon main dikhta he jahaan inhen khadaa nirupit kiya gaya he
 In representations he is shown wearing a cairn crown on the head
 mana jaataa he ki yah stupa gautam buddha ke avasheshon kaa nirupan karata he jinke dwaara maitrey apane uttaradhikari hone kii pahchaan sabit karenge or shwet camel par rakhe dharmachakr ko punah praapt karenge
 In greek-buddhist art he is also depicted holding the Aquarius in his left hand
 tibeti parampara ise gyaanapaatr ke rup main bhi dekhati he
 At some places, Asanga and Vasubandhu are represented on both sides
 buddha parampara main mana jaataa he ki maitrey vartmaan main tushit naamak swarg main nivas karte hai or apane prakatya ke samay kii pratiksha main hai
 It is also believed that Gautama Buddha also lived in this paradise before his birth
 sabhi bodhisattva dharti par apane avataran se purv is swarg main nivas karte hai
 However, the concept of Bodhisattva differs in the Hinayana and Mahayana branches of Buddhism

 The important function of a manager is to take decisions
 peter drukar kaa is sambandh main yah vichaar he ki prabandhak jo kuch bhi karata he, nirnyon ke dwaara hi karata he
 We know that administrators have to do many tasks from day to day and they have many options to do these tasks, the 'best' decision is to decide which of these options is the best option
 terry ne is sambandh main kaha he ki 'prashaskon kaa jivan hi nirnay lenaa he
 In Terry's words, if the administrator has a universal identity, it is for him to decide
 prashaasak ko apane nirnay prabandh ke kaaryon–niojit sanghathan, nirdesan, niyantran aadi ke antargat hi lene padate hai
 In other words, we can say that decision making is ubiquitous in the management process
 simon kaa yah vichaar ki nirnay lenaa hi prashasan he, bahu t uchit prathit hota he
 Whether or not we agree in Simon's words, it is an undeniable truth that decision is the heart of administration
 prashasan main nirnay nishchit prakriya ke parinaam hote hai
 The decision process has three characteristics - chunki nirnay karnaa ek prakriya he or vah ek samay par hota he isliye apane chaaron or kaa parivesh or saath–saath ghatane vaali ghatnaayen parinaam ko prabhavit karegi hi
 The literal meaning of nirvayana is that of reaching the final result, while in practical terms it means reaching the conclusion

 glover ke anusaar, chune hue vikalpon main se kisi ek ke sambandh main nirnay karnaa hi nirnayan he
 Ray According to Killians, adjudication is the simplest method of choosing different options
 george aar
 terry ke shabdon main, nirnay kisi ek kasuti par aadhaarit do yaa do se adhik sambhavit vikalpon main se ek kaa chunaav he
 According to Makefarland, decision making is an action of selection, under which an executive reaches a decision in the given circumstances of what should be done
 nirnay kisi vyavhaar kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jiskaa chayan anek sambhav vikalpon main se kiya jaataa he
 GLS According to Shackle, decision making is that focal point of creative mental activity, where knowledge, thought, emotion and imagination are a combination of tasks to accomplish
 arnest del ke anusaar, prashasnic nirnyon se aashay un nirnyon se he jo ki sadaiv sahi prashasnic kriyaaon, jaise –niyojan, sanghathan, karmchaariyon kii bhartee, nideshan, niyantran, nav pravartan tathaa pratinidhitiv ke dauraan liye jate hai
 In Lundvarg's words, administrative decision is a process in which an individual makes a decision to influence the behavior of other persons in the organization, so that those individuals can contribute to achieve the goals of the organization
 is prakaar yah spasht he ki nirnayan se aashay nirdhaarit lakshya kii prapti ke liye uplabdh vikalpon main se sarvshereshth vikalp kaa chayan karne se he
 Work is done in a particular situation, it is decided by the decision-makers
 nirnay karte samay prashaasak ke saamne ek se adhik vikalp hote hai
 Decision making is the conscious choice among many available options
 nirnay praaia: niti, niyam, aadesh athwa nirdesh ke rup main vyakt hote hai
 Therefore, in general, decisions are quite complex and difficult, but there are also many decisions in which discussions are more important
 sankshep main kah yah kah sakate hai ki jatiltam tathaa paraspar gunthi hui paristhitiyon ke antargat uplabdh kai vikalpon main se sanghathan kii kshamtanusaar ek shreshth vikalp ko chunane tathaa use prabhaav dhang se kaary kaa rup pradaan karne ko hi 'nirnayan' ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 Based on the above definitions, the following characteristics of decision can be called - herbert simon ne nirnay prakriya ke teen str batalaaye hai – Peter F
 Drucker explains the following steps of the decision process - newman, samar or warren ne nirnay prakriya ke nimna chaar charan batalaaye hai – Beke has given the following 11 steps of the decision process - nirnay prakriya ke upyukt charnon kaa adhyayan karne ke baad yah kaha ja saktaa he ki ek nirnay prakriya main nimnaankit charan ho sakate hai – In the first level of the decision process, it is very necessary to know and understand the objectives of any one problem in order to solve it systematically
 ye uddeshy is prakaar ke ho ki vyaktigat tathaa sansthagat uddeshyon main samanvay sthapit ho sake
 In this regard, Chester I
 Bernard says that before explaining the problem, any critical element must be known because the critical element is the center of decision
 yah vah bindu he jahaan par chunaav kiya jaataa he
 According to Hans and Messi, the critical element in the interpretation of the problem is dominant
 kai adhikari to yahaan tak kehete hai ki samasya kii vyakhya karnaa uske samaadhaan se bhi adhik kathin he
 Hence the problem should be interpreted carefully
 samasya kii spasht vyakhya tathaa paribhaasha ke baad nirnayan prakriya kaa aglaa charan samasya kaa vishle shan karnaa he
 If the problem is large, it is divided into several parts and each part of it is analyzed
 vishleshan ke liye sambandhit tathyon ko ekatrit kiya janaa chahie
 After clearly explaining and analyzing the problem, the decision maker develops various alternative solutions based on various information and facts
 vaikalpik samaadhaanon kaa vikaas karnaa nirnayan prakriya kaa ek mahatvapurn charan hai
 Therefore, administrators should have the ability to develop alternative solutions
 vibhinn vaikalpik samaadhaanon kaa vikaas karne ke baad in vikalpon kaa nirnay karne kii drushti se moolyankan karnaa hi nirnayan prakriya kaa aglaa charan he
 These options should be evaluated keeping the following in mind: vibhinn vikalpon kaa moolyankan karne ke baad nirnayan prakriya kaa aglaa charan un vikalpon main se kisi ek sarvshereshth vikalp kaa chunaav karnaa he
 Administrator's experience, research and analysis, etc
 may be the basis for the choice of options
 antim nirnay lene se purv prashaasak kai baton se prabhavit hota he
 His experience is important in this
 nirnyon ko lene main prashaskon ke dai nik anubhav mahatvapurn bhoomika adaa karte hai
 But always and decisions cannot be taken only on the basis of experience
 iske liye prashaskon ko chahie ki ve sanghathanon dwaara nirnyon ke prabhaavon kii vaastaviktaa tathaa kalpit paristhitiyon kii jaanch karen
 Research and analysis methods of selection are also considered to be highly effective methods
 jab kisi samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye koi nirnay le liya jaataa he, to aglaa charan usko kaaryrup pradaan karnaa he
 Administrators should make such efforts that the chosen procedure can be implemented smoothly
 nirnay ko jin logon par lagu kiya ja rahaa he, unki sahmati bhi us nirnay ke sambandh main lee jaani chahie
 When a decision is made functional, the administrator should evaluate the effects of that decision and collect all the necessary information regarding them
 saath hi saath prashaasak ko chahie ki vah kriyaaon par bhi niyantran sthapit kare jo ki nirnay ko kaary rup pradaan karne ke liye kii ja rahi he
 All the above levels of decision process can be called the levels of an ideal decision process, the above levels let us know what actions can be taken to decide
 in staron ko nirnay kii prakruti ke anusaar ghataya–badhaaya bhi ja saktaa he

 isaki sthapana maharaj indresh dwaara 1973 main kii gai thi
 The general information about the school is as follows: - harivansh parv mahabharat kaa antim parv he ise 'harivanshpurana' ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 There are three festivals and 318 chapters in Harivanshpuran
 harivanshpurana ke bhavishyaparv main puraana panchalakshan ke sargapratisarg ke anusaar sristi kii utpatti, brahm ke swaroop, avatar gananaa or sankhya tathaa yoga par vichaar hua he
 Souvenirs and communal ideologies are also found in most of the festivals

 Dance and acting material is found in its original form in Vishnuparva

 With this nut, Pradyumna, Samb etc
 go to Vajranabhpur and entertain the demons there with their skillful acting
 yahan par "ramayana" naamak uddeshy or "cober rambhaavisar" naamak prakaran ke abhinay kaa vishad varnan hua he
 Hapkins considers Harivansh to be the earliest festival of Mahabharata
 haajra ne raas ke aadhaar par harivansh ko chaturth shatabdi kaa puraana batalaaya he
 The period of Vishnupurana and Bhagavatpuran has been fixed by Hajra of the fifth century and the sixth century respectively
 shri dikshit ke anusaar matsaypurana kaa kaal tritiy shatabdi he
 When comparing Krishnacharitra, Rājī's account and other accounts, Harivamsa is predetermined by these Puranas
 atev harivansh ke vishnuparv or bhavishyaparv ko tritiy shatabdi kaa maananaa chahie
 Under Harivamsa, Harivanshaparva is known from Vishnuparva and Bhavishparva ancient in terms of style and accounts
 ashwaghoshkrut vajrasuchee main harivansh se aksharsh: samanta rakhanevaale kuch shloke milte hai
 Western scholar Wabber considered Vajralista as indebted to Harivansh and Ray Chaudhary supported his view
 ashwaghosh kaa kaal lagbhag dwitiya shatabdi nishchit he
 If the period of Ashwaghosha is second century, then the period of Harivanshaparva should be understood some time before the second century, except in the projected sites
 harivansh main kavyatatv anya pracheen puraanon kii bhanti apni visheshta rakhata he
 In the proper expression of Rasparipaka and Bhava, this Purana sometimes resembles excellent poetry
 vyanjanapurna prasang puranic kavi kii pratibha or kalpanaashakti kaa parichay dete hai
 In Harivamsa, simile, metaphor, metaphor, exaggeration, contrast, punishments and alliteration are often found
 ye sabhi alankaar puranic kavi ke dwaara prayaspurvak laae gaye nahin prathit hote
 From the point of view of poetry, Harivansh has originality and originality
 harivanshpurana, vishnupurana, bhagwatpurana or padmapurana ke rituvarnanon kii tulana karne par gyaat hota he ki kuch bhav harivansh main apane moulik sundar rup main chitrit kiye gaye hai or ve hi bhav uparyukt puraanon main kramash: athwa sanshlisht hote gaye hai
 Harivansh is an early Purana even in terms of content and style
