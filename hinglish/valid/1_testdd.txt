 If these countries are unable to purchase a needle attached to a personal protective device with a needle, a needle-remover must be used to remove the needle from the syringe

 Prior to needle safety regulations, hcws were on their own to avoid accidental safe disposal of needle sticks and needles
 However, in the US, following the signing of the Needle Stick Safety Act in 2000 and the 2001 Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, HCW was no longer a burden
 in niyamon ne donon nukile yaa sui ke saath suraksha upkarnon or sui- padchyut kaa upyog zaruri kar diya
 As a result, there was a large increase in research, development and marketing of needle protection devices and needle-remover
 In most hospital and medical settings in the US, needle safety regulations are maintained through needle personal protective equipment and needle disposal boxes

 As a result, a one-handed capping mechanism has been added to insulin and tuberculin syringes

 Nevertheless, more than 90% of syringes do not have autodisable features worldwide

 Consequently, many developing world countries use needle-remover to reduce the risk of transmission of the disease through these exposures

 The risk of transmission of the disease in developing countries is raised due to the high percentage of dipping stick injury, which is the result of insufficient dipping collection devices
 Increased pathogen transmission also results from reuse of contaminated needles when supplies are short

 The easiest needle-remover are electrically operated to operate and either melt the needle or cut the needle into multiple sections
 a patented design involves a syringe falling down into a chamber, where the driven movable blade advances the syringe on the opposite side fixed blade, at which point the syringe is cut into several points with a shearing motion

 Another one hand tool uses a downward motion to cause the gears to rotate and unscrew the needle collar from the syringe
 This design is very complex to implement, so an improvement of this design included pegs that rotate gears instead of grips and needle collars
 The downward force is transferred to the helical slots, which causes the needle collar to rotate and in the pegs to be removed from the syringe

 His father, Abu Bakr, became the first caliph to succeed Muhammad, and was succeeded by Umar two years later

 During Ali's reign, she wanted to avenge Uthman's death, which she attempted to do in the Battle of the Camel
 unhone apane oont ke peeche bhaashan or pramukh sainikon ko dekar yuddh main bhaag liya
 She lost the battle, but her involvement and determination left a lasting impression
 baad main, vah bees saal se adhik samay tak madina main chupchaap rahati thi, raajnneeti main koi hissaa nahin leti thi, ali se milakar ban gai or khalif muavia kaa virodh nahin kiya

 The idea of matching Aisha with Muhammad was suggested by Khwala bint Hakim
 iske baad, jubir ebn mutim ke saath aaisha ke vivaah ke sambandh main pichley samjhaute ko aam sahmati se alag kar diya gaya tha
 Abu Bakr was previously unsure "as to the propriety or legitimacy of marrying his daughter to his 'brother'"
 " british itihaaskaar wiliam montgomeri wat ne suzav diya ki mohammad ne abu bakar ke saath apane sambandhon ko majboot karne kii aashaa kii thi; sambandhon ko sudrudh karnaa aamtaur par arab samskruti main vivaah ke aadhaar ke rup main kaary karata he
 See also: Criticism of Muhammad, Islam, and Children § Marriage, and Child Marriage Aisha's age at the time of her marriage to Muhammad has been of interest since the early days of Islam, and references to her age are frequent by early historians
 sunni shaastra ke haddees ke sutron ke mutabik, aisha chah yaa saat saal kii thi jab shaadi ke saath mohammad se shaadi kar lee gai thi, jab tak vah nau yaa das saal kii umr tak nahin pahunch pai jiskaa arth he kai paryvekshakon dwaara yah ingit karne ke liye ki vah is umr main yuvavastha main pahunchi thim
 For example, Sahih al-bukhari said that Aisha heard that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and that she completed her marriage when she was nine years old, and then she lived with him for nine years
 
 sahahih al bukhari, 7:62:64 Recording the age of Aisha in the Hadith collection came a few centuries after the Prophet's death, as the Hadith records of early Islam through a verified unbroken series of reliable witnesses
 is sambandh main haddees sahih sthiti ke saath sangrah se aate hai
 However, some other traditional sources disagree
 ebn hisham ne mohammad kii apni jeevani main likhaa tha ki vah samaapti par das saal kii ho sakati hai
 Ibn Hisham wrote on the basis of his biography on the lost work of Ibn Ishaq even two hundred years after Muhammad, who was born 72 years after Muhammad's death
 isha ko shaadi main nau saal kii umr main, or ebn khallikaan or ebn saad al-bagdadi donon ne samaapti par baarah ke rup main darj kiya tha, baad main unke strot hisham ebn urava 
 Child marriage was not uncommon in many places at the time, Arabs included
 yah aksar raajnneetik uddeshyon kii seva karata tha, or aaisha kii mohammad se shaadi kaa raajnneetik arth tha
 Muslim writers who calculate Aisha's age based on more detailed information about her sister Asma estimate that she was over thirteen and probably between seventeen and nineteen at the time of their marriage
 ek irani islamic vidwaan or itihaaskaar mohammad niknaam arbhahi ne aaisha kii umr nirdhaarit karne ke liye chah alag-alag drushtikon par vichaar kiya he or nishkarsh nikaala he ki vah apane kishoron ke kishoron main vyast thim
 Using Fatima's age as a reference point, Lahore Ahmadiyya movement scholar Muhammad Ali has estimated that Aisha was more than ten years old at the time of marriage and more than fifteen years old at the time of its completion
 america itihaaskaar denis spelberg ne aisha kii comarya, vivaah kii umr or umr ke dauraan islamic sahitya kii samiksha kii he jab shaadi samaapt ho gai thi or anumaan lagaaya gaya tha ki aisha ke yuvaaon ko uski comarya ke bare main koi andeh nahin chhodane ke liye atiranjit kiya gaya ho saktaa he
 Spellberg says, "aisha's age is a major pre-occupation in Ibn Saad where her marriage varies from six to seven, with nine appearing stable at the end of her marriage as her age
" " vah paigambar kii ebn hisham kii jeevani main ek apwaad bataati he, jo bataati he ki jab esha 10 saal kii thi, to is baat ke saath unki samiksha kaa saransh diya gaya ki "dulhan kii umr ke in vishisht sandarbhon main aisha kii purv-menariyal sthiti ko majboot kiya gaya he or, jaahir he, unki comarya
 They also suggest the diversity of Aisha's age in the historical record
 " praarambhik musalamaanon ne aisha ke yuvaaon ko unki comarya kaa pradarshan karne or isliye mohammad kii dulhan ke rup main unki upyuktata ke rup main mana
 This issue of her virginity was very important to those who supported Aisha's position in the debate of Muhammad's succession
