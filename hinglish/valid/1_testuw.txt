 pahiyon ke dwaara yah yantra upar se thodaa sa dabaav or sahaara paakar chalane lagata he or chalane se pencil dwaara us kaagaj par jinke upar vah yantra chalata he nishaan banate rahete hai
 It was invented in 1853 by a French autocrat
 jab koi madhyam apni chetana ko sharir se hataakar kisi mrit praani dwaara apane sharir ko kriyavan hone de or planchet par apana haath athwa ungliyaan rakh de to mrit aatma us haath ke dwaara planchet ko chalaane lagati he or usamen lagi hui pencil dwaara jo likhnaa chaahati he likh detii he

 Unknown manner even if he or his hand moves the planchet
 par iskaa koi pramaan nahin ho saktaa ki kisi duusari aatma dwaara kuch likhaa ja rahaa he athwa madhyam ke achetan man athwa man ke kisi ucchstar dwaara kuch likhaa ja rahaa he

 It has now been proved indisputable that many supernatural powers are contained in the unknown mind of man which manifests in some mental state
 atev kuch log yah maanate hai ki planchet dwaara vahi gyaan hamako praapt hota he jo madhyam ke aantarik man ko praapt ho gaya he
 Sometimes, many things have been written by the great dead persons of history on the planchet
 aashcharya hota he ki ve mahan atmaaen kya prayek jivit vyakti ke itane sameep hai or kya unako itnaa samay miltaa he ki ve jahaan tahaan kabhi kabhi bina bulaae pahunch jaati hai
 Past, present and future things are written on the planchet
 kabhi kabhi bhavishyavaaniyan thik bhi nikal jaati hai
 Sometimes what is not known to those who sit nearby and medium is also written on the planchet

 This can be seen in Wells's book The Outline of History

 In his various short stories, novels, short novels, Paul Anderson, an anti-racist libertarian eunuch of Scandinavian descent, has repeatedly used the term Aryan as a synonym for the indo-european people
 unhone aryan ko ek aisi shikari chidiya kaha he jo inhen duusare grahon par ja kar vaahan apana kabja karne ko prerit karti he or anya grah pranali main upnivesh nivasaneey grah or nae upniveshwaad grah ke daur main unhen agrani udhmi ke taur par pesh karne ke liye protsaahit karti he
 The term Aryan is commonly used for Indians and Europeans or, to a lesser extent, Indians and Iranians, although many scholars today find this definition useless and politically incorrect in content-based older scholarship, but it is often mentioned in older books
 Such as the Scientific American by author Colin Renfrieu in 1989, in which the use of the term "aryan" was a traditional indo-eur Bilateral done for people
 19veen shatabdi main maanav-jati ke vigyaan ko kuch vidwaanon dwaara vaigyanik naslvaadi pravriti ke pratik ke taur par dikhalaayaa jaataa he, "arya vanshiyon" ko bhaaropee jati ke up-samooh ke rup main dekha jaataa he jo mul rup se hind europee bhashaa bhashaa ke bolne vaale the, jinke vanshaj portugali, hind europee the, jo europe, asian rus, anglo-america, dakshini dakshin america, dakshini africa, australia mahadweep, newjiland, armenia, greater iran or uttari bharat, or dakshini asia ke nepal, srilanka or maldweep main rahete the
 In the early 19th and 20th centuries the term Aryan referred to "portuguese-indian Germans and their descendants"
 Max Muller was often recognized as the first writer to use the term Aryan "caste" in English
 1861 main die gaye apane lectures on da science of language main usne aryan shabd kaa istemaal "res of pipul" ke rup main kiya, yani logon kii jati ke taur par kiya
 At that time, the term caste was used for clan or homogeneous group
 jab mular ke kathan ke anusaar aryan logon ko maanav-jati kaa ek vishesh samooh kaha jane laga to usne ye saafe kiya kii uskaa arth vanshaj se he na kii vishesh nasl se, usne kaha ki bhashaa-shaastra or maanav-vigyaan kaa mishran ek khatarnaak siddhant he
 He said that "linguistics and anthropology cannot be very different 


 but i must repeat what i have said many times before that it is wrong to call Aryan blood with a long head
 " usne apane virodh ko 1888 main likhe apane lekh biography of vards and da home of da aaryaas main bhi doharaaya
 Muller's response to this development of ethnic anthropology was, in fact, for the economer de Gobiniou, who believed that the indo-europeans represent the best race
 baad ke kai lekhak jaise francisi lekhak Vacher de Lapouge, ne apni kitaab l'aryen, main ye tark detaa he ki is visisth jati ko shirishya suchi kaa prayog kar or anya sanketakon se unke shaareerik banaavat se bhi pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 He argued that long-headed Europeans were found in northern Europe, which generally ruled people with "brachiocephalic"
 
 The division of white-born Aryans is purely a linguistic endeavor and not the starting point of anthropology, the focal point of the actual or natural division of anthropology, Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean, whereas linguistic etymology was the group whose relationship was Asian and African
 Was from the speakers
 haalanki baad main kuch maanav vigyanio or puraatatv mahiron ne "aryan" ke is bhashaayi vargeekaran ko chhetriyata se sambhddha kar diya, vishesh rup se uttari europe se
 In the 19th century, this idea gained considerable popularity
 19ve shatabdi ke madhya main kaha jane laga ki aaryon ki utpatti dakshin-pashchimi bhaag, jise aaj rus ke naam se janaa jaataa he, main hui
 But by the end of the 19th century, the logic of Aryan origins began to challenge the part, in which the idea of aryan origin was of ancient Germany or Scandinavia, the new argument began to prove the relation of Aryans to Germany or in the countries where aryan-kul The remains are found
 aaryon ke german mul ko, puratatvvetta gustaaf kojina ne pramukhataa se badhaava diya or daawa kiya ki proto-indo-european log niolithik germany ke corded ware samskruti ke samaan the
 In the 20th century, the intelligentsia propagated this argument fiercely, the concept of "choroid-noreadics"

 Germany's Rudolf Verchow theorized the study of dry skulls, he strongly contradicted the mystery of the Aryans' relation to the Nordic, northern Europe, in 1885 at the Congress of Archaeologists at Carlsruhe, in which the virtuoso's assistant, Joseph Coleman, said that Europeans, whether in England Be it German or French or Spanish, all are from mixed castes, in addition, he announced that the skull - According to science, no caste is better than anyone

 Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who was convinced of the superiority of the Aryans, responded in great detail to the arguments of Joseph Kollmann

 The model of indo-aryan migration refers to the prehistoric migration of the early indo-aryan settlements to their historic sites that were in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent and from there to the rest of the northern regions of India

 The issue of Dravidian caste is still very much disputed in India, from time to time it has sparked political and religious debate
 kuch dravid or dalit andolan ke samarthak, jo aam taur par tamil hai, kaa vishwaas he ki shiv ki puja karnaa sindhu sabhyataa se hi vishuddh dravidiya parampara he, jo aaryon ke hindu brahmanwad se bilkul bhinn he
 On the contrary, people associated with the Indian National Hinduism movement believe that the Aryans neither invaded or emigrated to any country, they insist that the Vedic ideology emanating from the Indus Valley Civilization, which was of indo-aryan Indicates arrival in India, it was in fact portuguese-dravidian culture
 british raaj ke dauraan kuch bhartiya bhi is bahes ke prabhaav main the
 Nationalist leader VD Savarkar believed that the "aryan race" migrated to India, but in the interpretation of racism he did not see any issue like "aryan race"

 2000 main andhra pradesh main kiye gaye ek anuvanshik adhyayan main paaya gaya ki ucch-jati ke hinduon kaa purvi europea ke logon se nikatatam sambandh he
 While this is not the case with people of the lower caste, in 2009 the Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology conducted a survey
 It tested about 132 people belonging to different groups of 25 castes in 13 states of India
 is survey ne is baat par jor diya ki jati se vansh kaa pataa lagaana mushkil he, report ke anusaar dakshin asia kii jatiyaan aryan hamalon ki dein nahin hai or na hi inkaa dravidian shoshan se koi sambandh he, darasal nae bhartiya samaaj ke nirmaan ki ye aarambhik prakriya thi jisame ye adivasee jatiyaan apane aapako paravaan chadhaa rahi thim
 At the end of the nineteenth century Helena Blavatsky and Henry Olcott founded the Theosophy Creed, an attempt to understand the debate of occultism under this ideology
 ye vichaardhaara bhartiya samskruti se prabhavit he, shaayad hindu sudhaarwadi andolan arya samaaj se isane prerana lee, jisaki buniyaad swami dayanand ne daali thi
 Blavatsky calls the descendants of humanity a series of "root races", according to him, the fifth number in this series comes from Aryan
 uskaa maananaa he ki aryan atlantis se aaye the, iskaa zikr wo is tarah karti he: Blavatsky uses one of the technical terms "root race" to describe human evolution for the greater time of his world science
 haalanki, usne daawa kiya ki kuch log aise the jo aryan kii tulana main tuchh the
 She consistently distinguishes "aryan" from "semitic" culture, stating that Semitics are a sub-branch of Aryan, with "a lack of spirituality and a multiplicity of materiality
" " uskaa kahana he ki kuch jatiyaan jaanwaron ke samaan hai
 In them, she mentions "people from parts of the Tasmania state of Australia and the mountainous regions of China
" " iske alaava lemuro-atlantic logon kaa kaaphi mishran bhi he jaise borneo ke junglee log, silon ke vedhas, jinhen pro flower ne arya kaha
 Despite all this, Blavatsky's supporters do not consider her thinking to be hangman or racist, believing that she speaks of Vishwa Bandhutva and that "the core of spirituality and biology is one", "the root of all humans and its essence is one" 
 In The Secret Doctrine Blavatsky writes that everyone's blood is the same, but their essence is not the same
 blavatski apane puure lekhan main aadhyatmik vishshataaon ke saath shaareerik vansh ko jodatii he: According to Blavatsky, "MONADS of the lowest specimens of mankind" has no karma for work when he was first born, because his brothers had more intelligence on the side
 " He also predicted the destruction of the castes as "the failure of nature" in the future to elevate the "upper caste": yah dhyaan dena kaaphi dilachasp he ki paanchavi yaa aryan mul jati kaa dwitiya up-shakha, arbian ko brahmavidyavadiyon dwaara aryan kii upashakha ke rup main mana gaya he
 It is believed by theologians that Arabs, although traditional theologians assert the authority of the Aryan dynasty and adopted the Semitic languages of those who came from Atlantis in the past)
 Theologians asserted that Jews were born as Arabian subcontinent who are now Yemen in 30,000 BC
 sabase pehle ve somalia gaye or baad main misr jahaan ve musa ke samay tak rahe
 Thus, according to the teachings of theology, the Jewish people are part of the Aryan dynasty

 Guido von List later took some of Blavatsky's ideas and combined his ideas with the ideas of nationalist and fascist; This type of idea became known as Arisophy
 arisophi main yah mana jaataa tha ki tutanic anya sabhi logon main shreshthatar the kyonki brahmavidya ke anusaar tutonic yaa nordic aryan mul jati ke viksit jati kii sabase haal kii upjati he
 Such an idea is shown in the development of Nazi ideology
 da aryan path jaise theosophical prakashnon main naji ke prayog kaa joardaar virodh kiya gaya he or yah jatvaad par prahaar karata he
 The idea of the northern origins of the Aryans is particularly influenced in Germany
 yah vyapak rup se mana jaataa tha ki "vaidic aryaayi" jaateey aadhaar par goth, vandal or volkarwanderang ke pracheen germany ke log ke samroop hote hai
 This idea was often intertwined with the anti-semitic idea
 aryaayi or sami logon ke bich purvokt bhashaai or jaateey itihaas ke aadhaar par bhed he
 The Sami people were seen as foreigners within the Arya Samaj, the Sami people were often identified as the causes of the transformation and destruction of the social order, and culture and culture by proto-nazi and Nazi theorists such as Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Alfred Rosenberg
 The rising value of civilization was attributed to the fall
 arisophi ke anuyaayiyon ke anusaar aryan "shaasha jati" the jisane sabhyataa kaa nirmaan kiya or jisane lagbhag das hajaar varsh pehle antlantis se puri duniya par varchasv rakhaa tha
 This alleged civilization was disallowed when other parts of the world became colonized after the destruction of Atlantis in 8,000 B
C
, as the backward castes mixed with the Aryans but the remains of this civilization remain in Tibet, even in Central America
 , South America, and also in ancient Egypt
 These theories further influenced the mysterious sites of Nazism

 Heinrich Himmler, who was commanded by Adolf Hitler to implement the final solution, or Ahuti, told his personal masseur Felix Kirsten that he always kept a copy of the ancient Aryan scripture Bhagavad Gita because it would give him his Relieves from the crime committed by him - he feels like a warrior Arjuna, he only does his duty without attachment to his deeds Used to follow himler kii buddha dharm or uske santhaan ahnenerbe jise hindutvvaad or buddha dharm kii kuch paramparaon ke mishran ke liye talasha gaya tha, main bhi ruchi thi -- gautam buddha ke dharm ke liye mul naam jise vartmaan main ham buddhism kehete hai vah da aryan path tha

 haalanki, is baat kii koi guarantee bhi nahin he
 GM crops may inadvertently cause allergies, antibiotic resistance, nutritional deficiencies, and toxicity
 iske baavjood visheshgyon kaa kahana he ki harek bhukhe pet tak bhojan pahunchane ke liye hamen apni paaramparik bhojan style ko hi aadhaar bananaa hoga
 In 2002, 55 thousand farmers in the country had grown cotton crops in four central and southern states of the country
 fasal ropane ke chaar maah baad kapaas ke upar ugane vaali rui ne badhanaa band kar diya tha
 After this the leaves started falling
 balwarm bhi fasalon ko nuksaan pahunchane laga tha
 In Andhra Pradesh alone, 79 percent of the cotton crop was damaged
 madhya pradesh main samoochee kapaas fasal barbaad ho gai thi
 In Maharashtra too, the crop grown on thirty thousand hectares was ruined
 natijatan, 200 se adhik kisaanon ne aatmahatyaayein kii or karodon rupye kaa nuksaan hua
 Later results revealed that the crop had damaged the crop and that the crop was both conventional and Bt
 darasal, pehali baar 1996 main pehali baar jiem beej bharat main pesh kiye gaye the
 Before that they had been used in about 25 countries
 ab desh main das anya jiem fasalon ke utpaadan kii taiyaari ho chuki he
 However, the path of their arrival in the market will be decided only when Bt Brinjal will get commercial success
 anya fasalon main chaaval, aalu, tamaato, makka, moongfalee, gobhi jaisi subjiyan hai

 haalanki, beati coton vyavsaayik taur par jari kiya ja chukaa he or ise safalataa mili he
 But other crops that are currently undergoing laboratory research are wheat, basmati rice, apples, bananas, papayas, onions, watermelons, peppers, coffee and soybeans

 In view of all the protests related to GM crops, the government has recently decided to work fast on the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority Bill
 bharat main beati khadyann par uthi bahes ko lekar paryaavaran mantralay ne nirnay liya he ki vah philhal beati bangan kii kheti ko roke rakhegi
 The bill recommends a three-member Autonomous Biotechnology Regulatory Authority in this regard related to public health
 iske atirikt yah athurity jiem rice or jiem tamaato aadi ke prayogon or utpaadan sambandhi pareekshanon par bhi najar rakhegi
 That is, this authority will have the privilege of calling all the entrepreneurs associated with the GM crops business and keeping an eye on the entire GM business sector
 is swytt ikai kii teen shakhaaen hogi
 First, it will monitor agriculture, forest and fisheries industry, second, public health and veterinary issues and third industrial and environmental issues
 athurity ke paas jaev-praudyogiki main istemaal kiye jane vaale sabhi organism ke aayaat par najar rakhane or shodh manjuuri dene sambandhi ikai bhi hogi
 The government has recommended that if an unlawful test is conducted, it can impose a minimum of five years of imprisonment and a heavy fine
 is maamle main dobaaraa aparaadh karne waalon ko or bhi kadi sajaa di jaaegi
 Since biotechnology is a public health issue
 bill main athurity ke kisi nirnay ke khilaaf shikaayat kii sunwaayee karne sambandhi tribunel sthapit karne kii bhi sifarish kii gai he
 That is to say, if this bill comes in the form of a new law through Parliament soon, then under it a new regulation will be applied on the research, production and trade related to biotech products in the country
 san 1996 main pehali jiem fasal ke commercial istemaal ke baad se ab tak duniya kii aath pratishat krishi yogya bhoomi par jiem fasalon kii kheti chal rahi he
 Usually farmers have to save some part of their previous crop so that the next crop can be planted
 lekin jiem fasalon ke liye vishesh beej chahie hote hai
 These seeds are expensive and far from the reach of the common farmer
 inke pun: istemaal ke liye roylty deni hoti he or kisaan apane khet kii pichhali fasal ke beej ko dobaaraa istemaal nahin kar sakate
 And it is also argued that due to better crop and less use of pesticides, farmers save more capital, so they should pay the seeds for the next crop
 yahi kaaran he ki sarkaar ne bhi jor dekar jiem fasal sambandhi kade niamak lagu karne kii baat kahi he
 GM crops are used in many countries of the world
 inamen uttar or dakshin america ke adhikansh desh shaamil hai jahaan soyabean, makka, rai or chukundar aadi kii jiem fasalein ugaai or istemaal main laai jaati hai
 More than half of the world's GM crops are used in the United States
 iske vipareet europe ke keval saat deshon main hi abhi tak jiem fasalon ke istemaal ko kanoonee manyata pradaan kii gai he
 Even in Asia, only three countries, including India and China, have started using GM crops, but there are strict regulations for this

 jarges brank france ke mahaan chitrakaar hai | At the age of seventeen, Mehrunnisa was married to a courageous Iranian young man named 'alikuli', who was given the title of Sher Afghan and the manor of Burdwan at the beginning of the reign of Jahangir
 1607 i
 main jahangir ke duuton ne sher afakhaan ko ek yuddh main maar daalaa
 Mehrunnisa was captured and brought to Delhi and sent to the emperor's royal harem
 yahan vah badshaah akbar kii vidhwaa rani 'salima begum' kii paricharika bani
 Mehrunnisa first saw Jahangir on the occasion of Nowruz festival and, enchanted by her beauty, Jahangir married her in May, 1611 AD
 vivaah ke pashchaat jahangir ne use ‘nurmahal’ evam ‘noorjehan’ kii oopaadhi pradaan kii
 In 1613 AD, Nur Jahan was made 'pattamahishi' or 'badshah Begum'
 asaadhaaran sundari hone ke atirikt noorjehan budhimati, sheel or viveksmpann bhi thi
 He had a special interest in literature, poetry and fine arts
 uskaa lakshya bhed achook hota tha
 In 1619, he killed a lion with a single bullet
 in samast gunon ke kaaran usne apane pati par purna prabhutv sthapit kar liya tha
 As a result, the entire weight of Jahangir's rule had fallen on him
 sikkon par bhi uskaa naam khoda jane laga or vah mahal main hi darbar karne lagi
 His father Etmaduddola and brother Asaf Khan were accorded a high position in the Mughal court and his niece, who later became known as Mumtaz, married Shah Jahan
 usne pehle pati se utpann apni putree kaa vivaah jahangir ke sabase chote putr shehryaar se kar diya or kyonki uski jahangir se koi santan nahin thi, at: vah shehryaar ko hi jahangir ke uparaant raaj singhaasana par baithaana chaahati thi
 All these works of Nur Jahan were a part of his diplomacy
 1620 i
 ke ant tak noorjehan ke sambandh khurram se achche nahin rahe, kyonki noorjehan ko ab tak yah ahsaas ho gaya tha ki shahjahan ke baadashah banane par uskaa prabhaav shashan ke kaaryon par kam ho jaayga
 Therefore Nur Jahan started giving importance to Jahangir's second son 'shaharyar'
 chunki shehryaar alpaayu evam durbal charitra kaa tha, isliye uske samraat banane par noorjehan kaa prabhaav pehle kii tarah shashan ke kaaryon main bana rahata
 For this reason Sher married his daughter 'ladli Begum', born of Afghan, to Shaharyar in 1620 AD and granted him mansab of 8000 / 4000
 shahjahan ko jab is baat kaa ahsaas hua ki noorjehan uske prabhaav ko kam karnaa chaah rahi he, to usne jahangir dwaara qandahar durg par akraman kar use jeetne ke aadesh kii avhelnaa karte hue 1623 i
 main khusro khaan kaa vadh kar dakkan main vidroh kar diya
 To suppress his rebellion, Nur Jahan did not send Asaf Khan and sent Mahavat Khan under the leadership of Shahzada Parvez
 un donon ne safaltaapurvak shahjahan ke vidroh ko kuchal diya
 Shah Jahan surrendered to Father Jahangir and was pardoned
 jamaanat ke rup main shahjahan ke do putron daara shikoh or aurangzeb ko bandhak ke rup main rajdurbar main rakhaa gaya
 By 1625 AD, Shah Jahan's rebellion completely subsided
 shahjahan ke vidroh ko dabaane main mahatvapurn bhoomika kaa nirvaah karne vaale mahavat khaan se noorjehan ko irshyaa hone lagi
 Nur Jahan realized that Mahavat Khan was one of those who did not accept my dominance in the work of governance
 mahavat khaan evam shahzada parvej kii nikatataa se bhi noorjehan ko khatara tha
 So to minimize his influence, Nur Jahan asked him to go to Bengal and give the account of the money looted during the war
 in kaarnon ke atirikt kuch or kaaran bhi the, jisase apamaanit mahasoos kar mahavat khaan ne vidroh kar kabul ja rahe samraat jahangir ko jhelum nadi ke tat par 1626 i
 main qaid kar liya
 Nur Jahan and his brother Asaf Khan were also arrested
 qaid main rakhane par bhi mahavat khaan ne jahangir ke prati nishtha evam sammaan kii baat nahin sochi
 In Rohtas, Nur Jahan and Jahangir liberated themselves from the influence of Mahavat Khan through diplomacy
 mahavat khaan apni suraksha ke liye ‘thatta’ kii ore bhaag gaya
 After Parvez's death on October 28, 1626, Mahavat Khan was weakened in some way and he went to the service of Shah Jahan
 jahangir ke jivan kaal main noorjehan sarvashakti sampann rahi, kintu 1627 i
 main jahangir kii mrityu ke uparaant uski raajnneetik prabhutaa nasht ho gai
 Nur Jahan died in 1645 AD
 apni mrityu paryant tak kaa shesh jivan usne lahore main bitaayaa
 Evidence of his artistic interest is available in the grand and attractive mausoleum, which he built in Agra on the bone relics of his father Etmaduddola
 kalavidon ke anusaar yah mazebara baarik or saaj-sajja kii drushti se anupam he
 Ancient Greek civilization refers to a culture that stretched from about the eighth century BCE to about the sixth century AD in Greece and its nearby regions
 aadhunik pashchimi samskritiyon kii sab se gahari jad isi sabhyataa ko mana jaataa he, isliye pashchimi itihaaskaaron ke liye unani sabhyataa hameshaa bahut mahatvapurn rahi he
 It is believed that ancient Greece had a strong influence on the Roman Empire that came after this civilization and the impression of Greek culture can be seen in many aspects of that empire and culture
