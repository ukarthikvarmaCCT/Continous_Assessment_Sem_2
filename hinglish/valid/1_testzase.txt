 This article has been translated from this edition of the Wikipedia article Gross domestic product
 sakal gharelu utpaada yaa jidipi yaa sakal gharelu aay, ek arthvyavastha ke aarthik pradarshan kaa ek buniyadi maap he, yah ek varsh main ek raashtra kii seemaa ke bheetar sabhi antim maal or sevaao kaa bazaar mulya he
 GDP can be defined in three ways, all of which are conceptually similar
 pehla, yah ek nishchit samay avadhi main ek desh ke bheetar utpaadit sabhi antim maal or sevaao ke liye kiye gaye kul vyay ke baraabar he
 Second, it is equal to the sum of the total value added at each stage of production and subsidized tax on products by all industries within a country within a period
 teesraa, yah ek avadhi main desh main utpaadan ke dwaara utpann aay ke yoga ke baraabar he- arthath karmchaariyon kii kshatipurti kii raashi, utpaadan par kar aurasabsidi rahit aayaat or sakal parichaalan adhishesh The most common method of measuring and simply determining GDP is the expenditure or expenditure method: "sakal" kaa arth he sakal gharelu utpaada main se puunji share ke moolyahras ko ghataya nahin gaya he
 If the net investment is replaced by the gross investment in the above equation, the formula for net domestic product is obtained
 is sameekaran main upbhog or nivesh antim maal or sevaao par kiye jane vaale vyay hai
 The export-import part of the equation adjusts by subtracting the portion of expenditure not generated domestically and adding it back to the domestic sector
 arthshaastri saamaanya upbhog ke pad ko do bhaagon main baantna pasand karte hai; nijee upbhog or saarvajanik kshetra kaa kharch
 Theoretical macroeconomics has two advantages in dividing total consumption in this way: africa · uttar americadakshin america · asiaurope · oshinia Microeconomics · Macroeconomics: History of economic ideas
 System · Mainstream and heterodox ganitiya arthshaastra · khel siddhant ishtatameekaran · abhiklanaatmayarthamiti · prayogtmak aankade · rashtriya lekha Pragmatic patrikaai · prakashanshreniyan · ruparekha · arthshaastri Each variable C, I, g and x - m as given above) ' ko ek GDP lekhachitr ke sandarbh main y ke dwaara darshaya jaataa he
 Spending on new housing by a household is also included in the investment
 iske bolchaal ke arth ke vipareet, GDP main 'nivesh' kaa arth vittiya utpaadon ke kray se nahin he
 Purchases of financial products are classified as 'savings', not as investments
 vibhed spasht he: yadi dhan ko maal yaa sevaao main badla jaataa he, yah nivesh he ; lekin, yadi aap ek bond yaa stoke kaa ek share kharidte hai, yah hastantaran bhugtan GDP se alag kar diya jaataa he
 So stocks and bonds indirectly affect GDP
 haalaanki aise kray ko saamaanya bhashaa main nivesh hi kaha jaataa he, kul aarthik drushtikon se yah keval anubandhon kaa vinimay he or vaastavik utpaadan yaa GDP kaa hissaa nahin he
 It does not include any transfer payments such as social security or unemployment benefits
 C, I, g or NX ke udhaaharan : yadi aap apane hotel ke navinikaran ke liye dhan kharch karte hai, taaki adhibhog kii daron main vruddhi ho, to yah nijee nivesh he, lekin yadi aap aisa hi karne ke liye ek sangh main share kharidte hai ta yah bachat he
 The former is used when measuring GDP, not the latter
 lekin, jab sangh naveekaran par apane swayan ke kharch karata he, tab is kharch ko GDP main shaamil kiya jayega
 For example, if a hotel is a private home, then the renewal expense will be considered consumption, but if a government agency is converting the hotel into an office of civil services, the renewal expense will be considered a part of the public sector expenditure
 yadi navinikaran main videsh se ek jhumar kii kharid shaamil he, to vyay kii gananaa bhi aayaat kii vruddhi ke rup main kii jaati he, taaki NX kaa maan gir jaae or kul GDP kray ke dwaara prabhavit hota he
 If a domestic manufacturer is paid to build a chandelier for a foreign hotel, the situation will be reverse and the payment will be calculated in NX
 Again, GDP measures output through expenditure; If the chandelier generated was domestically purchased, it would have been included in the GDP figures when it was purchased by a consumer or business, but because it was exported to give the domestically generated amount It is necessary to "fix" the amount consumed domestically
 main
 Calculating real GDP growth helps economists determine whether production has decreased or increased, unaffected by changes in the purchasing power of the currency
 GDP ko maapne kaa ek anya tarika he, kul dey aay kaa maapan GDP aay ke khaaton main karnaa
 In this situation, GDP is sometimes used instead of GDP
 iske dwaara vahi aankde praapt hone chahie jo uparyukt vyay vidhi main praapt hote hai
 = GDP
 In practice, however, the measurement of the two figures was found to be slightly different due to measurement error when reported by the National Statistical Agencies
 aay drushtikon kaa upyog karte hue, maapan kiye gaye GDP ke liye sutara GDP kehalaata he, yah he: This often includes most small businesses
 COE, GOS or GMI kaa kul yoga kul kaarak aay kehalaata he or yah kaarak mulyon par GDP ke maan kii gananaa karata he
 The difference between basic prices and final prices is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has applied to or paid for production
 to aayaat or utpaadan par sabsidi rahit kar ko jodne se GDP kaarak laagat par GDP main badal jaataa he
 Another formula can be written as: jahaan r = kirayetti = byaaj p = laabhtsha = sankhyikeey samaayojan w = mazdooree GDP can be contrasted with the gross national product, which the United States used until 1992 in its national accounts
 antar yah he ki GNP main shuddh niryaat or aayaat ke bajaay shuddh videshi aay shaamil hoti he
 Generally speaking, GNP includes net foreign investment income in comparison to GDP

 GDP is related to the region in which income is generated
 yah ek varsh main ek raashtra main utpann kul out put kaa bazaar mulya he
 GDP pays attention to where the out put is originating, not who is producing it
 GDP sabhi gharelu utpaadanon kaa maapan karata he chaahe isaki utpaadan icaayiyon kii rashtriyata koi bhi ho
 In contrast, GNP measures the value of an out put generated by the 'nationality' of a region
 GNP is baat par dhyaan detaa he ki utpaadan kaa maalik koun he
 For example, in the United States, GNP measures the value of out put produced by American companies regardless of where they are located

 GDP in each country is typically measured by a national government statistical agency, as private sector organizations generally do not have the necessary information available

 The key benefit of GDP per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured repeatedly, consistently and widely; Frequent means that most countries provide information on GDP on a quarterly basis, meaning that some measure of GDP is widely available for every country in the world, and the technical definitions used consistently within GDP, countries
 And are relatively stable, and therefore there is a belief that equal measurement is being done in each country
 jivan str ke ek sanketak ke rup main GDP kaa upyog karne kaa ek mukhya nuksaan yah he ki yah kadai ke saath jivan str kaa maap nahin he
 GDP measures a specific type of economic activity in a country

 For example, in an extreme example, a country that exported 100 percent of its production and did not import anything would still have a high GDP, but a very low standard of living

 He has eight grandchildren and five grandchildren
 Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in Mon Repos on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921, the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg
 Philip's four elder sisters were Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, and Sophie
 He was baptised into the Greek Orthodox Church
 His godparents were Queen Olga of Greece and the Mayor of Corfu
 Shortly after Philip's birth, his maternal grandfather, Prince Louis of Battenberg, then known as Louis Mountbatten, Marquess of Milford Haven, died in London
 Louis was a naturalized British citizen, who, after a career in the Royal Navy, had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten during the First World War
 After visiting London for the memorial, Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the greco-turkish War
 The war went badly for Greece, and the Turks made large gains
 On 22 September 1922, Philip's uncle, King Constantine I, was forced to abdicate, and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others
 The commander of the army, General Georgios Hatzianestis, and five senior politicians were executed
 Prince Andrew's life was believed to be in danger, and Alice was under surveillance
 In December, a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life
 The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Prince Andrew's family, with Philip being carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box
 Philip's family went to France, where they settled in the Paris suburb of saint-cloud in a house lent to them by his aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark
 Because he left the country as a baby, he does not have a strong grasp of Greek
 In 1992 Philip said that he "could understand a certain amount of" the language
 Philip was first educated at an American school in Paris run by Donald macjannet, who described Philip as a "rugged, boisterous 


 but always remarkably polite" boy
 In 1928, he was sent to Britain to attend Cheam School, living with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle, George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire
 In the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was placed in an asylum after being diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his father moved to a small flat in Monte Carlo
 Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood
 In 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, which had the "advantage of saving school fees" because it was owned by the family of his brother-in-law, Berthold, Margrave of Baden
 With the rise of Nazism in Germany, Salem's Jewish founder, Kurt Hahn, fled persecution and founded Gordonstoun school in Scotland
 After two terms at Salem, Philip moved to Gordonstoun
 In 1937, his sister Cecilie, her husband, her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 After leaving Gordonstoun in 1939, Prince Philip joined the Royal Navy, graduating the next year from the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, as the best cadet in his course
 During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christopher of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side
 He was commissioned as a midshipman in January 1940
 Philip spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies, protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent, on HMS Shropshire and in Ceylon
 After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet
 Among other engagements, Philip was involved in the Battle of Crete, and was mentioned in despatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which he controlled the battleship's searchlights
 He was also awarded the Greek War Cross of Valour
 Duties of lesser glory included stoking the boilers of the troop transport ship RMS Empress of Russia
 He was promoted to sub-lieutenant after a series of courses at Portsmouth in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination
 In June 1942, he was appointed to the v and w class destroyer and flotilla leader, HMS Wallace, which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain, as well as the allied invasion of Sicily
 Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942
 In October of the same year he became the first lieutenant of HMS Wallace, at 21 years old one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy
 During the invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, as second in command of HMS Wallace, he saved his ship from a night bomber attack
 He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed
 In 1944, he moved on to the new destroyer, HMS Whelp, where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla
 He was present in Tokyo Bay when the instrument of Japanese surrender was signed
 In January 1946, Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the Whelp, and was posted as an instructor at HMS Royal Arthur, the Petty Officers' School in Corsham, Wiltshire
 In 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth
 During the visit, the Queen and Earl Mountbatten asked Philip to escort the King's two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, who were Philip's third cousins through Queen Victoria, and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark
 Elizabeth fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters when she was thirteen
 Eventually, in the summer of 1946, Philip asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage
 The King granted his request, provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth's twenty-first birthday the following April
 By March 1947, Philip had abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles, had adopted the surname Mountbatten from his mother's family, and had become a naturalised British subject
 The engagement was announced to the public on 10 July 1947
 Though Philip appeared "always to have regarded himself as an Anglican", and had attended Anglican services with his classmates and relations in England, and throughout his Royal Navy days, Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher wanted to "regularise" Philip's position by officially receiving him into the Church of England, which he did in October 1947
 The day preceding his wedding, King George VI bestowed the style His Royal Highness on Philip and, on the morning of the wedding, 20 November 1947, he was made the Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich of Greenwich in the County of London
 Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey, recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world
 However, in post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for any of the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations to be invited to the wedding, including Philip's three surviving sisters, all of whom had married German princes, some of them with Nazi connections
 After their marriage, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh took up residence at Clarence House
 His first two children were born: Prince Charles in 1948 and Princess Anne in 1950
 Philip returned to the navy after his honeymoon, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty, and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich
 From 1949, he was stationed in Malta after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Chequers, the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet
 On 16 July 1950, he was promoted lieutenant commander and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie
 He was promoted to commander in 1952, but his active naval career ended in July 1951
 With the King in ill health, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were both appointed to the Privy Council on 4 November 1951, after a coast-to-coast tour of Canada
 At the end of January 1952, Philip and his wife set out on a tour of the Commonwealth
 On 6 February 1952, when they were in Kenya, Elizabeth's father died and she became queen
 It was Philip who broke the news of her father's death to Elizabeth at Sagana Lodge, and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom
 The accession of Elizabeth to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house
 The Duke's uncle, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, advocated the name House of Mountbatten, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; however, when Queen Mary, Elizabeth's paternal grandmother, heard of this suggestion, she informed the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who himself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor
 Churchill's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten, whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India, may have contributed to this
 The Duke privately complained, "I am nothing but a bloody amoeba
 i am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children
" On 8 February 1960, several years after the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill, the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that the surname of male-line descendants of the Duke and the Queen who are not styled as Royal Highness, or titled as Prince or Princess, was to be mountbatten-windsor
 While it seems the Queen had "absolutely set her heart" on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only eleven days before the birth of Prince Andrew, and only after three months of protracted correspondence between the constitutional expert Edward Iwi and the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan
 After her accession to the throne, the Queen also announced that the Duke was to have "place, pre-eminence and precedence" next to her "on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament"
 This meant the Duke took precedence over his son, the Prince of Wales, except, officially, in the British parliament
 In fact, however, he attends Parliament only when escorting the Queen for the annual State Opening of Parliament, where he walks and sits beside her
 Contrary to rumors over the years, the Queen and Duke are said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage, despite the challenges of Elizabeth's reign
 The Queen referred to Prince Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her "constant strength and guide"
 During his wife's Golden Jubilee in 2002, the Duke was commended by the Speaker of the British House of Commons for his role in supporting the Queen during her reign
 The Duke of Edinburgh's time as royal consort exceeds that of any other consort in British history; however, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who died aged 101, was the consort with the longest lifespan
 In April 2008, Philip was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital for "assessment and treatment" for a chest infection, though he walked into the hospital unaided and recovered quickly, and was discharged three days later to recuperate at Windsor Castle
 In August, the Evening Standard reported that he was suffering from prostate cancer
 Buckingham Palace, which usually refuses to comment on rumors of ill health, claimed that the report was an invasion of privacy and issued a statement denying the story
 The newspaper retracted the report and admitted it was untrue
 In June 2011, in an interview marking his 90th birthday he said that he would now slow down and reduce his duties, stating that he had "done bit"
 His wife, the Queen, gave him the title Lord High Admiral for his 90th birthday
 While staying at the royal residence at Sandringham, Norfolk, on 23 December 2011, the Duke suffered chest pains and was taken to the cardio-thoracic unit at Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he underwent successful coronary angioplasty and stenting
 He was discharged on 27 December
 On 4 June 2012, during the celebrations in honor of his wife's Diamond Jubilee, Philip was taken from Windsor Castle to the King Edward VII Hospital, London, suffering from a bladder infection
 He was released from hospital on 9 June
 After a recurrence of infection in August 2012, while staying at Balmoral Castle, he was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for five nights as a precautionary measure
 In June 2013, Philip was admitted to the London Clinic for an exploratory operation on his abdomen, spending 11 days in hospital
 On 21 May 2014, the Prince appeared in public with a bandage on his right hand after a "minor procedure" was performed in Buckingham Palace the preceding day
 He is the longest-lived male member of the British royal family
 The record for the longest-lived male descendant of Queen Victoria is currently held by Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg who lived to be 95 years, 6 months and 5 days old
 Prince Philip would surpass this record on 15 December 2016
 Philip played polo until 1971, when he started to compete in carriage driving, a sport which he helped expand; the early rule book was drafted under his supervision
 He was a keen yachts sailor, striking up a friendship in 1949 with Uffa Fox in Cowes
 He and the Queen regularly attended Cowes Week in HMY Britannia
 His first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952; by his 70th birthday he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours
 He was presented with Royal Air Force wings in 1953
 In April 2014, it was reported that an old British Pathe newsreel film had been discovered of Philip's 1962 two-month flying tour of South America
 Filmed sitting alongside Philip at the aircraft's controls was his co-pilot Peter Middleton, the grandfather of the Duke's granddaughter-in-law, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge
 He has painted with oils, and collected artworks, including contemporary cartoons, which hang at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and Balmoral Castle
 Hugh Casson described Philip's own artwork as "exactly what you'd expect 


 totally direct, no hanging about
 Strong colours, vigorous brushstrokes
" In 1979, when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of US President Jimmy Carter, Prince Philip was approached by White House butler Lynwood Westray and another unnamed butler
 Westray asked him "your majesty, would you like a cordial?", And Prince Philip responded, "i'll take one if you'll let me serve you"
 "oh my God, this had never happened before," said Westray
 "there we were standing there
 i was holding the glasses and my buddy was holding the liqueurs and we looked at each other, and i said 'if that's the only way you'll have it, we'll go along with it
' And the prince served us what he was having, and the three of us had a drink and a conversation
 It was an honor to let him do it
 " Over his sixty years as royal consort, Philip has become famous for making remarks that were often construed as being offensive or stereotypical in nature
 Some of them were immediately interpreted as gaffes; but other awkward observations were construed by apologists as merely odd, off-colour, and often funny
 In his own words, comments attributed to Prince Philip have contributed to the perception that he is "a cantankerous old sod"
 The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of "HRH Victor Meldrew"
 For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, "no wonder you are deaf listening to this row
" Later Philip wrote, "the story is largely invention
 It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and i have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that i would do any such thing
" During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, "if you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed
" The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned
 Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go "round-eyed"
 His comment had no effect on sino-british relations, but it shaped his own reputation
 Philip has been a Freemason since 1953
 Philip has held a number of titles throughout his life
 Originally holding the title and style of a prince of Greece and Denmark, Philip abandoned these royal titles prior to his marriage, and was thereafter created a British duke, among other noble titles
 It was not, however, until the Queen issued Letters Patent in 1957 that Philip was again titled as a prince
 When addressing the Duke of Edinburgh, as with any male member of the royal family except the monarch, the rules of etiquette are to address him the first time as Your Royal Highness, and thereafter as Sir
 The Duke of Edinburgh was appointed by King George VI to the Order of the Garter on 19 November 1947, the eve of his wedding
 Since then, Philip has received 17 different appointments and decorations in the Commonwealth, and 48 from foreign states
 The inhabitants of some villages on the island of Tanna, Vanuatu also worship Prince Philip as a god; the islanders possess portraits of the Duke and hold feasts on his birthday
 Upon his wife's accession to the throne in 1952, the Duke was appointed Admiral of the Sea Cadet Corps, colonel-in-chief of the British Army Cadet Force, and Air commodore-in-chief of the Air Training Corps
 The following year, he was appointed to the equivalent positions in Canada, and made Admiral of the Fleet, Captain General Royal Marines, Field Marshal, and Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom
 Subsequent military appointments were made in New Zealand and Australia
 To celebrate his 90th birthday, the Queen appointed him Lord High Admiral of the Royal Navy and Canada appointed him to the highest ranks available in all three branches of the Canadian Armed Forces
 Template: Infobox COA wide Philip is the oldest living great-great-grandchild of Queen Victoria, as well as her oldest living descendant following the death of Count Carl Johan Bernadotte of Wisborg on 5 May 2012
 Through his descent from the British royal family, he is in the line of succession to the thrones of the 16 Commonwealth realms
 In July 1993, through mitochondrial DNA analysis of a sample of Prince Philip's blood, British scientists were able to confirm the identity of the remains of several members of Empress Alexandra of Russia's family, several decades after their 1918 massacre by the Bolsheviks
 Prince Philip was then one of two living great-grandchildren in the female line of Alexandra's mother Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, the other being his sister Sophie, who died in 2001

 Indigo has been cultivated in India since ancient times
 iske alaava nil ranjak kaa bhi sabase pehle se bharat main hi nirmaan evam upyog kiya gaya
 The indigo plant is two to three cubits high
 pattiyaan chameli kii tarah tahani ke donon ore pankti main lagati hai par choti choti hoti hai
 Flowers are planted in the stars
 lambii lambii babul kii tarah faliyaan lagati hai
 There are around 300 species of indigo plant
 par jinase yahan rang nikaala jaataa he ve paudhe bharatvarsh kai hai or arab misr tathaa american main bhi boe jate hai
 India is the abode of indigo and it was here that color was first extracted
 80 isvi main sindh ke kinare ke ek nagar se nil kaa baahar bheja janaa ek pracheen unani lekhakr ne likhaa he
 Many foreigners at the back have mentioned the sowing of indigo here
 isa kii padrahavin shatabdi main jab yahan se nil yorape ke deshon main jane laga tab se vahaan ke nivaasiyon kaa dhyaan nil kii or gaya
 The first people started the work of indigo and for a few days they were considered skilled throughout the Europe for dyeing indigo
 nil ke kaaran jab vahaan kai vastuon ke vaanijya ko dhakka pahuchane laga tab france, germany aadi kanoon dwaara nil kii aamad bad karne par vivash hue
 For a few days, people kept calling Neil a poison even in England, which caused it to go there
 peeche belgium se nil kaa rang banaanevaale bulaae gaye jinhone nil kaa kaam sikhaaya
 In the past, Neil Europe traveled from Gujarat and surrounding countries; Not from Bihar, Bengal etc
 east india company ne jab nil ke kaam kii or dhyaan diya tab bengal bihar main nil kii bahut si kothiyaan khul gayi or nil kii kheti main bahut unnati hui
 Indigo is cultivated in different places and in different ways in different places
 kahin to fasal teen hi maheene tak khet main rahete hai or kahin atharah maheene tak
 Where plants remain in the field for a long time, there are many times cut leaves and etc
 from them
 par ab fasal ko bahut dinon tak khet main rakhane kii chaal uthati jaati he
 In Bihar, Neel Phagun is sown in the month of Chait
 garmi main to fasal kii baadh rukii rahati he par pani padate hi jor ke saath tahaniyaan or pattiyaan nikalati or badhati he
 Therefore, the first pen is made in Ashadh and twigs etc
 are sent to the factory
 khet main keval khuntiyaan hi rah jaati hai
 The field is then plowed on the back of the pen, so that it absorbs the rainy water well and the pegs then grow into pods
 duusari kataai phir kuwaar main hoti he
 Color is extracted from indigo in two ways - from green plants and dried plants
 kate hue hare paudhon ko gadi hui naandon main dabaakar rakh dete hai or upar se pani bhar dete hai
 After being in water for twelve to fourteen hours, its juice comes down in water and the color of water becomes rich
 iske peeche pani duusari naand main jaataa he jahaan dedh do ghante tak lakdi se hilaayaa or matha jaataa he
 This churning is also done by machine rotation
 mathne ke peeche pani thiraane ke liye chhod diya jaataa he jisase kuch der main maal neeche baith jaataa he
 Then this indigo sitting at the bottom is boiled by mixing it with clean water
 ubal jane par yah baans kii fattiyon ke sahare tanakar failaae hue mote kapade kii chandani par dhaal diya jaataa he
 This moonlight works as a filter
 pani to nither kar bah jaataa he or saaf nil lei ke rup main laga rah jaataa he
 This wet indigo is pressed hard in a box containing small holes, in which the wet cloth is overlaid, which causes its seven to eight fingers thick folds
 iskai katare katkar ghore dhire sookhne ke liye rakh die jate hai
 After drying, a crust settles on these shears, which they clean
 ye hi katare nil ke naam se bikate hai
 In electronics, a light-isolator is an electronic component that can transmit an electrical signal from one circuit to another through light, which is deflected from the first circuit
 is prakaar yah do alag-alag voltata par sthit paripathon ke bich sanketon kaa aadan-pradaan kar saktaa he
 Thus, its function is that of an isolator
 kintu ise prakaash-yugmak bhi kehete hai kyonki yah paraspar vilgit do paripathon ko sanket dwaara 'jodne' kaa kaam bhi karata he
 Commercially available light isolators provide isolation up to 10 thousand volts and can withstand voltage changes of up to 10 kv / μs
 sabase saamaanya prakaash-vilgak main ek prakaash utsarjak diod tathaa ek phototrangistor hota he
 Both of these are manufactured within the same opaque package
 praayah prakaash-vilgakon kaa upyog ankiy sanketon ke sanchaar ke liye kiya jaataa he kintu kuch vidhiyon kaa upyog karke inhen anuroop sanketon ke saath bhi kaam main liya ja saktaa he
 The importance of obtaining an electromagnet by pairing a solid-state light emitter with a semiconductor detector was realized in 1963
 1968 main prakaash-pratirohak par aadhaarit prakaash-yugmak nirmit kiye gayi
 Richard Phillips Fineman was the most talked about scientist of the last part of the twentieth century
 ve 1966 me nobel puraskaar se sammanit hue
 In the middle of the twentieth century there was a dispute over the way physics was taught in good universities
 is vivaad ko finemen jaisaa hi vyakti anjaam de saktaa tha kyonki unka rutaba sabhi maanate the
 He was not respected because he was at Cal Tech, but Cal Tech was considered to be the best physics university in the world because the finmen were there
 finemen ne 1961-63 me cyle-tech me snaatak ke vidhyaarthiyon ko bhautik shaastra padhaayaa
 These three years gave a new direction to teach physics and physics started to be taught with new subjects
 in lekcharon ko teen kitabon ne badla gaya
 She was in red bindings and became known as' Lectures on Physics by Richard p Feynman
 richard philips finemen, kaa janm 11 may 1918 main hua tha or mrityu 1988 main cancer se ho gayi
 As a kid, finmen often wondered what he would grow up to be: a jester or a scientist
 bade hokar unhone in dono bhoomikaaon ko ek saath bakhubi nibhaayaa
 People say why he became so famous, but scientists rightly say about him: ' finemen to aitihaasik vyakti hai unako jitna sammaan mila ve us sab ke adhikari hai
 ' finemen ke pita kaa baton ko bataane kaa apana hi dhang tha
 There is a one time story that father and son were walking in the park, father pointed to a bird and told that this bird is known by different names in the world
 yah jaruri nahin he ki aap un sab naamo ko jane, na hi mahatvapurn he
 But what is important is what and how she does it
 ve bachche ke man me jigyaasa jagaane kii koshish karte the yah bataane kii jarurat nahin he ki finemen bachapan se jigyaasu tathaa kutuhali the
 At school he was the best in mathematics and the hero of the mathematics team
 par unhone ganit ko chhod diya
 He felt that by getting higher education in Mathematics, he could not do anything other than teaching Mathematics to others
 vah kuch vyavhaarik karne kaa soch kar, pehle electrical ingeneering kii taraf gayi par baad main bhautik shaastra kii padhai kii
 Fineman completed his undergraduate education at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
 vah vahiin par shodh kaary karnaa chaahate the par phir prinkton me shodh kaary karne ke liye chale gayi
 Later they used to say, 'yah thik hi tha
 i came to know that the world is very big and there are many good places to work
 ' Young princes got a chance to do research with Wheeler in Princeton
 us samay tak whealer ko nobel purushkaar to nahin mila tha par ve vah kaam kar chuke the jis par unhe baad me nobel purushkaar mila
 They were very fanciful, some even expressed their importance
 unhone finemen ko saptaah main ek din kaa kuch nishchit samay milane kaa diya
 On the first day of the meeting, he was wearing a suit, took out his gold break from his pocket and placed it on the table so that the finemen would know when his time was up
 finemen us samay vidhyaarthee the
 They bought an inexpensive stop watch from a market - they had no money to buy expensive watches
 agali meeting par unhone apni sasti ghadi us sone kii ghadi ke paas rakh di
 Wheeler should also know that his time is also important
 whealer ko majaak samaj main aayaa or dono dil khol kar hanse
 Both of them removed the watches
 unka rishta aupchaarik nahin rahaa, ve mitra ban gayi, unki baaten hansi majaak main badal gayin or hansi-majaak naye moulik vichaaron me
 Meanwhile, a second great war has started
 germany me parmaanu bam banane kaa kaam ho rahaa tha, yadi pehle vahaan ban jaataa to hitler ajey tha
 In America's Los Almos Laboratory, the scientists of the world gathered and united to make atomic bombs
 finemen ko bhi vahaan bulaayaa gaya or unhone vahaan kaam kiya
 In Los Almos, security was the responsibility of the army, which had its own laws
 yah niyam finemen ko aksar samaj me nahin aate the
 Finemen were expert in opening locks
 ve sena ke adhikariyon ko tang karne ke liye kii leboratory kii tijoriyon khol kar usame kaagaj par guess who likh kar chhod dete the par tijoriyon se kuch nikaalte nahin the
 He used to do this only to tell the army officers how wrong his security system is
 skool ke dinon main finemen kaa apni sahpaathini arlin se prem ho gaya
 They thought of getting married when the finmen got a job
 jab finemen shodh kaary kar rahe the tab arlin ko tii
bi
 ho gayi uske paas keval chand saalon kaa samay tha
 Those days T
B
 There was no treatment
 arlin ko tii
bi
 ho jane ke kaaran, finemen use chuum bhi nahin sakate the
 He knew that his relationship with Arlene would be only spiritual
 in sab ke baavjood, finemen arlin se shaadi karnaa chaahate the
 His family and friends were against this marriage
 is bare me unki apane pita se anban bhi ho gayi
 Despite this, the finemen married Arlene
 finemen, jab los elmos main kaam kar rahe the to vahaan ke nideshak raubart openhaimar ne arlin ko paas hi ke seniterium main bharti karvaa diya taaki finemen usase mil sake
 Arlene died while the Finemen were in Los Almos
 is ghatana chakra par ek pikchar bhi bani he jiskaa naam infinity ) he ise matheyu bordwik ne nirdeshit kiya he
 Finemen were alive and often worked for fun
 mouj masti me hi unhone us vishay par kaam kiya jis par unhe nobel puruskaar mila
 This is also an interesting anecdote
 duusare mahayuddh ke dauraan los elmos laboretary main finemen kii mitrataa beth se hui jinase unki kaaphi patati thi
 Beth was in the court, so the finmen also went to the court
 ek din ve kauranal ke alpaahar grih main baithe the
 a student threw a plate there
 plate safed rang kii thi or usamen bich main kauranal kaa laal rang kaa chinh tha
 The plate was also wavering and moving around
 yah ajeeb nazaaraa tha
 The finmen began to waver and roar and to find a relationship between them
 isame kaaphi mushkil ganit ke sameekaran lagate the
 It took him a lot of time
 unhone paaya ki dono me 2:1 kaa sambandh he
 His colleagues told him why he is wasting time in it
 unka jawaab tha, 'it doesn't matter, I'm doing all this for fun
 ' But he was not right about its importance
 ve jab electron ke ghoomane ke bare main shodh karne lage to unhen kauranal kii dagamagaati or gumti plate main lagi ganit phir se yaad aane lagi
 This led to the principle that he received the Nobel Prize
 sach he jivan main bahut kuch vah bhi aavashyak he jo keval mouj masti ke liye ho, chaahe uskaa koi or mahatv ho yaa na ho - mouj masti hi apane aap me ek mahatv kii baat he
 If you can find your livelihood in fun, then what is the matter, if it cannot be, then maybe it is another good thing to find fun in livelihood itself
 finemen na hi ek mahaan vaigyanik the par ek mahaan adhyaaapak bhi the
 He knew how to make his point known to another
 vyaakhyaanshaala unke liye rangashaala thi, jisamen naatak bhi tha or aatishbaajee bhi
 i have started this article in the introduction of cal-tech lectures on physics by Finemen
 in lekcharon ko unhone sitambar 1961-may 1963 me diya tha
 These lectures were special, so they were kept safe forever and later these three were printed as red books
 finemen saptaah main keval do lacture dete the baaki samay vah in lekcharon ko taiyaar karne main lagaate the
 They used to consider every line of lecture, every joke in advance
 kabhi bhi unke saath lacture ke notus nahin hote the
 There was only a small paper in which some special words were there only to indicate further
 yah teen saal, sansar me kisi bhi vishvavidhyalay ke, kisi bhi vishay par ke lekcharon me adwitiya hai
 It never happened like this or maybe it will happen again
 kyonki malum nahin ki phir kabhi aisa vyakti aayegaa ki nahin
 English was a useless and philosophical subject for the fine men
 Religion se unka koi vaasta nahin tha
 It was not in his interest to talk about the rounds
 vah hameshaa sidhi baat karte the
 They meant what they used to say
 ve is baat se bhramit ho jate the yadi unki sidhi baat duusare ko pareshaan kar detii thi
 People remember finmen differently - some people, sambhavat: sabase zyada log unhen us vyakti kii tarah se yaad karte hai jisane tivi ke saamne saarvajanik rup se bataaya ki chalanger-durghatana kyon hui
 On 28 January 1986, a commissioner was set up to investigate the Challenger spaceship exploded in the sky
 finemen usamen vaigyanik kii haisiyat se the
 The explosion was caused by the installation of some substandard goods in the spaceship
 nasa kaa prashasan ise dabaanaa chahta tha par vaigyanik ise ujagar karnaa chaahate the
 The commission began airing its findings in front of TV
 us samay tivi par hi, sabake saamne finemen ne ekadam thande pani ke andar ghatiya saamaan ko daal kar dikhaaya ki vastav main visphot kyon hua tha
 It was a live telecast, so the performance of The Finemen could not be stopped, and this two-minute clip became the world's most played news clip within a few hours
 finemen pisadina main aksar vahiin ke ek restaraan me jate the, jahaan par toplace pariveshikaayen rahati thim
 In that restaurant, he used to tell his master the physics and he was painting them
 ek baar police waalon ko laga ki us restaraan main kuch gadabad- sadabad hota he or restaraan ke maalik par ashleelata kaa mukadmaa chalaaya
 In fact, there was no such work
 us restaraan main kai pratishthit vyakti aate the restaraan ke maalik ne un sabase gavaahi dene kii prarthana kii
 Everyone cut off the tomb, but the finemen did not
 unhone restaraan maalik ke paksh main gavaahi di or agle din akhabaaron ke pehle panne par sabase mukhya khabar ke rup main chhapi
 'caltech's Feynman tells lewd case jury, he watched the girls while doing his equations' yah sab padhane yogya hai

 The centers of this mature civilization were in Punjab and Sindh

 One of the reasons for the fertility of Indus was the floods coming from the Indus River every year

 shaareerik maut mrityu ek baar kii sthiti: prakriya ab prativarti main dekha jaataa he
 Where a dividing line in the process of death and life is drawn, the normal clinical death depends on the absence of significant symptoms between death and is not sufficient for a necessary legal determination

 Signs of death or strong signs that a person is still alive: maut kii avadharana kii kunjee ghatana he vahaan kii avadharana ke liye kai vaigyanik tareeke hai
 For example, brain death, in medical practice as science, defines death as a point in time during which brain activity remains
 This is a distinction from a life of defining challenges in a death
 samay main ek bindu ke rup main, mrityu ke kshan, jis par jivan samaapt hota he kaa ullekh karne ke prathit hota he
 However, when determining death has occurred, precise drawing of conceptual boundaries between life and death is required
 is samasyagrast he kyonki vahaan kaise jivan ko paribhaashit karne se adhik chote aam sahmati he
 It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness
 When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died
 One of the notable flaws in this approach, however, is that there are many organisms that are alive but perhaps not conscious for example, the single-celled organism is another problem with this approach to consciousness, which many different modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers have The definition given by is used in defining
 maut ko paribhaashit karne kii yah aam samasya chikitsa ke sandarbh main paribhaashit kii maut khaas chunauti dene ke liye lagu hota he
 Other definitions for death focus on the character of some disturbance
 In this context, "death" is simply the state where something is left, eg, life describes
 is prakaar, "jivan kii paribhaasha ek saath maut paribhaashit karata he
 Historically, attempts to define the moment of death of a human have been problematic
 or giraftaar ek baar paribhaashit ke rup main band ke dil hriday haraaya he, lekin seepiaar kaa vikaas or sheeghra defibrillation aparyaapt paribhaasha he pradaan kii he ki kyonki shwaas or dil kii dhadkan ko punah aarambh kiya ja saktaa he kabhi kabhi

 yah mana jaataa he ki vidyut gatividhi kaa ek ant chetana ant kaa sanket bhi he
 However, the suspension of consciousness should be permanent and not transient, as something happens during sleep stages and especially coma

 However, at present, the conservative definition of most deaths in places of electrically irreversible termination in whole brain activity as opposed to the neo-cortex has been adopted in the Uniform United States Act for example
 , Terri Schiavo case brought to the question the american politics of livelihood and artificial brain death puure dimag maapdand, mastishk mrityu kaa sankalp dwaara bhi jatil ho saktaa he
 The Eagles base could detect simulated impulses, while some drugs, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, or hypothermia can prevent or temporarily suppress brain activity by suppressing the brain's brain
 Because of this, hospital defined conditions include widely varying intervals

 The joint is the places in the body where two bones meet each other, such as the shoulder, elbow or hip joint
 inkaa nirmaan sharir main gati sulabh karne or yantric aadhaar hetu hota he
 They are classified on the basis of structure and their functions
 sharir main visheshkar teen prakaar kii sandhiyaan pai jaati hai: achal sandhi, ardhachal sandhi tathaa chal sandhi
 In these treaties, the joints of the bones are combined
 donon asthiyon ke bich kuch bhi antar nahin hota
 Due to this, there is no movement at the confluence of bones
 donon asthiyaan tantu utak dwaara aapas main judi rahati hai
 Three categories are found in these treaties: in sandhiyon main asthiyon ke bich main upasthi rahati he tathaa gati kam hoti he
 Two distinctions are found in this category
 in sandhiyon kii gati abaadh hoti he
 The following characteristics are found in them: 1
 kor sandhi ke sandhayak prishth ek duusare ke anukool aise ban jate hai ki asthiyaan keval ek hi aksh par gati kar sakati hai, jaise kakuhani kii sandhi; 2
 In Vivartika Sandhi, one bone becomes like a coil, and the other moves like a tenon of a door, and rotates in it, such as the forearm joint; 3
 sthulkaay sandhi main ek lanbaa sa gadha ban jaataa he or duusari asthi unnatodar or lambotaree si ho jaati he
 This part resides in the fabrication of the first bone and the bones are tied together by the nerves, such as the joint ie wrist joint
 inamen aakuchan, vistaar, abhivartan, apvartan, paryaavartan ityadi kriyaayein hoti hai
 4
 In the parya pact, the shape of a bone is similar to that of a gene

 In the ulukhal pact, a bone is formed

 skandh sandhi or nitamb sandhi iske udhaaharan he
 6
 Simple Sandhi - Its pages are so folded and the position of the nerves is such that the bones can move a little bit here and there, like the vertebral joint
 sharir main sandhiyon kaa prayojan gati hota he
 Therefore, their composition is also such that the bones can move and at the same time do not be dislocated from their place
 prayek sandhi par ek tantuk yaa snaivik koshika chadhi rahati he, jo sampurna sandhiyon ko dhakati hui sandhi main bhaag lene vaali asthiyon ke siron par lagi rahati he

 jin sandhiyon ke bheetar sanghayak chakrika rahati he, vahaan snehak str kii ek parat saghyank chakrika ke upar bhi faili hoti he, jisase snehak str tathaa sanghayak chakrika ke bich main, snehak kala kii khaali main, snehak dravya upasthit ho jaataa he
 This lubricant fluid keeps the parts of the arthritic bone smooth and prevents them from rubbing
 snaayu tantumay utak ke samaantar sutron ke laben patt hote hai
 They connect both the ends of the two bones
 inke bhi donon sire do asthiyon ke avistari bhaagon par lage rahete hai
 It is situated outside the muscle cell and some inside
 bhitari snaayu kii sankhya kam hoti he
 It keeps muscles on nerves
 in aavarnon kii do paraton ke bich ek drav hota he, jo visheshkar un sthanon par paaya jaataa he, jahaan snaayu asthi ke sampark main aati he
 Due to this, there is no damage in the nerves during the time of the work of the treaty
 yah bhinn aakaar kii jhilli hoti he, jisaki snehak kala kii koshika main gadha snigdh dravya bharaa rahata he
 It rests more between the pages of the ashes that rub on each other, or the treaties that only move
 prayek chal sandhi main mansapeshiyon kii sikudan or prasar se nimnlikhit kriyaayein hoti he : Padigaon is a village in Raigad district under the state of Chhattisgarh, India in Raigarh division

 This article is about Yashodhara, the work of Maithilisharan Gupta
 gautam buddha kii patni yashodhara ke liye rajkumaari yashodhara dekhen
 Maithili Sharan is a famous poem written by Gupta which was published in 1933 AD
 apane chote bhai siyaaramsharan gupt ke anurodh karne par maithilisharan gupt ne yah pustak likhi thi
 This epic is written in the Yashodhara epic keeping the story of Gautama Buddha's home sacrifice at the center
 isamen gautam buddha kii patni yashodhara kii virahajanya pidaa ko vishesh rup se mahatva diya gaya he
 This prose-verse is a mixed genre called Champukavya
 yashodhara kaa uddeshy he pati-parityakton yashodhara ke hardik du:kha kii vyanjana tathaa vaishnav siddhanton kii sthapana
 Amazed by the aura of Amitabh, the devotees were first interviewed by the pain of the invisible Yashodhara, the immortal singer of human relations, Maithilisharan Gupta, the founder of human-friendly sympathy
 saath hi 'yashodhara' ke madhyam se sanyas par grihasth pradhan vaishnav dharm kii gaurav pratishtha kii he
 == Storyline = Katharambha comes from the disinterested contemplation of Gautama
 jaraa, rog, mrityu aadi ke drishyon se ve bhaybheet ho uthte hai
 To search for the nectar element, Gautama leaves his wife and son asleep and performs 'mahabhinishkramana'
 yashodhara kaa niravadhi virah atyant kaarunik he
 More than the virility of Virh he eats the beloved "to steal
" isar samajhati he parantu use maran kaa bhi adhikaar nahin he, kyonki us par rahul ke paalan-poshan kaa daayitv he
 As a result, she lives by "milk in anchal" and "water in eyes"
 siddhi praapt hone par buddha lautate hai, sab log unka swaagat karte hai parantu maanini yashodhara apane kaksh main rahati hai
 Finally God himself reaches her door and begs
 yashodhara unhen apni amuly nidhi rahul ko de detii he tathaa swayan bhi unka anusaran karti he
 The first half and history of this story is famous but the latter is the creation of the poet's own prolific imagination
 'yashodhara' kaa pramukh ras shringaar he, shringaar main bhi keval vipralambh
 There is a coincidence of coincidence
 shringaar ke atirikt isamen karun, shant evam vatsalya bhi yathasthaan uplabdh hai
 The poetry presented presents an impression of shadowy craft
 ukti ko adbhut kaushal se chamatkrit evam saprabhav banaaya gaya he
 The language of Yashodhara is pure Khadiboli - its softness and masculinity are the special qualities of maturity, creativity and lyricism, thus Yashodhara proves to be an excellent creation
 keval shilp kii drushti se to vah 'saket' se bhi sundar he
 Even from the point of view of poetry, 'yashodhara' is indicative of Gupta's management skills
 yah prabandh-kavy he- lekin samakhyanatmak nahin
 It is theatrical because of the poet's focus on characterization, and there is a predominance of lyricism in the characterization of a dignified woman
 at: 'yashodhara' ko pragitatmakataa natya prabandh kahana chahie, jo ek sarvatha paramparamukt kavy rup he
 Yashodhara's viraha is extremely darun and the reason for being perceived as an obstacle to the path of siddhi seems to hurt his self-respect
 parantu vah naritv ko kisi bhi ansh main hin maanane ko prastut nahin he
 She is the Indian wife, her half-hearted expression is outspoken - "I will have something in it that you will get
 " sab milakar yashodhara adarsh patni, shreshth mata or aatmgaurav sampann nari he
 But Gupta has protected Gautama's traditional sublime character as soon as possible
 yadhyapi kavi ne unke vishwaason evam siddhanton ko amaanya tehraaya he tathaapi unke chirprasiddh rup kii raksha ke liye ant main 'yashodhara' or 'rahul' ko unka anugami bana diya he
 Rahul is of paramount importance in the composition and development of the object in the poetry presented
 yadi rahul sa laal god main na hota to kadaachit yashodhara maran kaa hi varan kar leti or tab is 'yashodhara' kaa pranayan hi kyon hota
 Rahul's mentality is mentioned in 'yashodhara' poetry
 uski balsulabh cheshtaaon main adbhut aakarshan he
 Over time, his intellect also develops, which is evident from his utterances
 parantu yah sab ekadam swaabhaavik nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In some cases, Rahul talks tactfully, like Prudo, which is certainly exaggerated even in the context of a born child
 yashodhara ek charitra pradhan kavy he
 The purpose of the creation of this book is to highlight the character of Upekshita Yashodhara
 kavy ke namakaran se hi siddh ho jaataa he ki yashodhara hi is kavy kii pramukh paatr he
 Gupta intended to compose this poem with the purpose of interpreting his saga
 in panktiyon se is baat kaa gyaat ho jaataa he- The poet has also thrown more light on the Virahini form of Yashodhara
 virahinee gopa raat-din ansu bahaati he
 He realizes that he is born only to cry
 us ablaa jivan kii aankhon main sadaiv pani bharaa rahata he or isiilie vah apane pati ko nayan-nir hi detii he
 Crying in front of Rahul hurts Rahul, that is why he is full of heart and cry after he falls asleep
 is prakaar vah rote-rote raat katati he
