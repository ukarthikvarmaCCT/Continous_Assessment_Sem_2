 ayurvigyaan vigyaan kii vah shakha he, jiskaa sambandh maanav sharir ko nirog rakhane, rog ho jane par rog se mukt karne athwa uskaa nidaan karne tathaa aayu badhaane se he
 India is the father of medical science
 apane praarambhik samay main ayurvigyaan kaa adhyayan jeev vigyaan kii ek shakha ke samaan hi kiya gaya tha
 Later, 'anatomy' and 'physiology' etc
 were made its basis
 ayurvigyaan kaa janm bharat main kai hajaar varsh i

 The knowledge of the actions that take place in the body revealed that their form is very chemical and these phenomena are the result of the chemical activities
 jyon-jyon khojein huin tyon-tyon sharir kii ghatnaon kaa rasinic rup saamne aata gaya
 In this way, chemistry became so important that it became a separate branch of medicine, which was named biochemistry
 iske dwaara na keval shaareerik ghatnaon kaa rup spasht hua, varan rogon kii utpatti tathaa unke pratirodh kii vidhiyaan bhi nikal ain
 At the same time, physics also helped in understanding physical phenomena very well
 yah gyaat hua ki anek ghatnaayen bhautik niyamon ke anusaar hi hoti hai
 Like biochemistry, biophysics has also become a part of medical science and it has also helped in understanding the origin of diseases and in resisting them
 vigyaan kii anya shakhaon se bhi rogrodhan tathaa chikitsa main bahut sahaayta mili he
 And with the help of all these, a lot of progress has been made in the welfare of human beings, which has resulted in increased lifespan

 But the result of this in-depth study is that medical science is divided into many branches and so much discovery has been made in each branch, new tools have been made and experimental methods have been known that no scholar or student can be fully familiar with them all
 
 din--prati--din chikitsak ko prayogshaalaon tathaa yantron par nirbhar rahanaa pad rahaa he or yah nirbharta uttarottar bad rahi he
 The goal of every education is the mental development of a human being, so that it can generate the power to reason and understand and manifest and implement its emotions accordingly

 For this, among all medical students, the student has to spend five years as an undergraduate
 medical collejon main vidhyaarthiyon ko aadhaar vigyaanon kaa adhyayan karke ucch madhyamik shiksha praapt karne par bharti kiya jaataa he

 After this, he works in a department according to his interest for one year and obtains functional knowledge of that subject
 tatpashchaat vah snatakottar shikshan main diploma yaa degree lene ke liye kisi vibhaag main bharti ho saktaa he
 All medical colleges belong to one or the other university which conducts their examinations and courses and aims to generate the power of reasoning in science students and inaugurate new science mysteries
 ayurvigyaan vidyalayon ke prayek shikshak tathaa vidhyaarthee kaa bhi uddeshy yahi hona chahie ki use roganivarak nai vastuon kii khoj karke is artinashak kala kii unnati karne kii cheshtaa kerani chahie
 Not only this, the life goal of teachers should also be that they produce such investigators
 chikitsapaddati kaa centrestambh vah saamaanya chikitsak he jo janata yaa pariwaron ke ghanishtha sampark main rahata he tathaa aavashyaktaa padane par unki sahaayta karata he
 He is the friend and counselor of his patients and tries to give them philosophical solace in time
 vah rog sambandhi saadhaaran samasyaon se parichit hota he tathaa doorvarti sthanon, gaanvon ityadi, main jaakar rogiyon kii seva karata he
 Here he does not get all the tools of help which he had seen during his teaching period and which he had learned to use
 bade nagaron main ye bahut kuch uplabdh ho jate hai
 When required, he has to seek the help of a specialist or send the patient to the hospital
 aajkal is vigyaan kii kisi ek shakha kaa vishesh adhyayan karke kuch chikitsak visheshgy ho jate hai
 In this way, special treatment is available by experts in heart disease, mental diseases, astigmatism, pediatric etc
 aajkal chikitsa kaa vyay bahut bad gaya he
 Essential examinations, valuable drugs, methods of medicine and equipment are the main reasons for the diagnosis of the disease
 aadhunik ayurvigyaan ke kaaran janata kaa jeevankaal bhi bad gaya he, parantu aushadhiyon par bahut vyay hota he
 It is to be regretted that due to the present economic conditions, proper treatment has gone beyond the power of ordinary human beings
 chikitsavigyaan kii shakti ab bahut bad gai he or nirantar badhati ja rahi he
 Nowadays contraception can be done
 garbh kaa ant bhi ho saktaa he
 The mitigation of pain, keeping in unconsciousness for a long time, the successful treatment of many infectious diseases, suppression and enhancement of instincts, the change of sentiment by drugs, the effect on personality by surgery, etc

 Aristotle carried on the work of his mentor Plato
 plato, sucraat or arastu pashchimi darshanashastra ke sabase mahaan darshanikon main ek the
 He made the first comprehensive work on Western Philosophy, which combined policy, logic, science, politics and spirituality
 bhautik vigyaan par arastu ke vichaar ne madhyayugin shiksha par vyapak prabhaav daalaa or iskaa prabhaav punarjagran par bhi padaa
 Newton's materialism eventually replaced it

 His arguments are relevant even today
 unki aadhyatmik rachanaaon ne madhyayug main islamic or yahudee vichaardhaara ko prabhavit kiya or ve aaj bhi chrishchiyan, khaskar roman catholic carch ko prabhavit kar rahi hai
 His philosophies are still taught in higher classes
 arastu ne anek rachanaaen kii thi, jisamen kai nasht ho gai
 Aristotle's famous treatise on politics is Politics
 arastu kaa janm 384-322 i
 pus
 main hua tha or vah 62 varsh tak jivit rahe
 His place of birth was a city called Stagira
 unke pita macedoniya ke raja ke darbar main shahi vaidya the
 Thus the court of Macedonia had a profound influence on Aristotle's life
 unke pita kii maut unke bachapan main hi ho gai thi
 After the father's death, 17-year-old Aristotle was sent by his guardian to the Intellectual Education Center Athens to complete his education
 vah vahaan par bees varsho tak plato se shiksha pate rahe
 In the last years of his studies, he himself started teaching in the academy
 unke dwaara da layisium naamak sanstha bhi kholi gai |arastu ko us samay kaa sabase budhimaan vyakti mana jaataa tha jiske prashansa swayan unke guru bhi karte the
 Aristotle is counted among the great philosophers who were earlier such men and did not rely on traditions to arrive at any conclusion only after examining any event
 347 isvi purv main plato ke nidhan ke baad arastu hi academy ke netritv ke adhikari the kintu plato ke shikshaaon se alag hone ke kaaran unhen yah avasar nahin diya gaya
 Aristotle went to his court at the invitation of Atranius' friend Shashk Hrmiyaz
 wo vahaan par teen varsh rahe or is dauraan unhone raja kii bhatiji hrpelis naamak mahila se vivaah kar liya
 Before Aristotle's second wife, he married a woman named Pithius, after whom he had a second marriage
 iske baad unke yahan necomax naamak putr kaa janm hua
 The most surprising thing is that Aristotle's father and son had the same name
 shaayad arastu apane pita ko bahut prem karte the isi vajah se unki yaad main unhone apane putr kaa naam bhi vahi rakhaa tha
 At the invitation of King Philip of Macedonia, he began teaching his thirteen-year-old son
 pita-putr donon hi arastu ko bada sammaan dete the
 People even used to say that Aristotle gets a lot of money from the royal court and thousands of slaves live in his service, although all these things were baseless
 elexander ke raja banane ke baad arastu kaa kaam khatm ho gaya or wo waapas athens aa gayi
 Aristotle founded the Platonic School and Platoism
 arastu aksar pravachan dete samay tahaltey rahete the isliye kuch samay baad unke anuyaayi peripetetics kahalaane lage
 Aristotle liked to discover, especially on subjects that are related to human nature such as "how does a man face problems whenever he encounters them?" And "how does a man's brain work?" Should there be an administration that works in a proper way to keep the society connected with the people
 aise prashnon ke uttar paane ke liye arastu apane aas paas ke maahaul par praayogic rukh rakhte hue bade itminan ke saath kaam karte rahete the
 He used to give detailed lectures to his disciples in the morning and ordinary people in the evening
 alexender kii achaanak mrityu par macedoniya ke virodh ke swar uth khadey hue
 He was also accused of atheism
 wo dand se bachane ke liye chalsis chale gayi or vahiin par alexender kii maut ke ek saal baad 62 varsh kii umr main unki mrityu ho gayi
 In this way Aristotle became immortal as a great philosopher in the pages of history by becoming a disciple of the great philosopher Plato and a master of Alexander

 In contrast, no algorithm is known to characterize integers in polynomial time on non-quantum computers
 strong carch turing thisis ek darshanik tark he jo kahata he ki - agar kisi computesnal problem ke liye kisi computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm ban saktaa he, to us problem ke liye ek clasical computer par bhi polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm jarur hoga; or agar kisi problem ke liye ek clasical computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm nahin ban saktaa he, to us problem ke liye kisi bhi computer par polinomial time main chalane vaala algoridm bhi nahin ban saktaa he
 Since an algorithm running in polynomial time is known on a quantum computer for the factorization of integers, according to the Strong Church Turing thesis there would be an algorithm running in polynomial time on a non-quantum computer for the factorization of integers

 Since then, a number of lawsuits have been filed against employers and manufacturers who disregarded asbestos asbestosis protection measures even after a contract was established between asbestos, asbestosis and mesothelioma

 apane shodh nishkarshon main, warner ne kaha ki america saamaajik varg kaaphi had tak in saajha drushtikonon par aadhaarit tha

 The class reconfiguration of Iran had a significant impact after the 1979 revolutionary turmoil
 After the disintegration of the process of accumulation in the first revolutionary decade, the pace of capitalist production relations slowed down
 This resulted in the polarization of labor and the decolonization of agriculture, and a general increase in commodity trade and the proliferation of small scale industries, the rise of small capitalists, as well as a considerable increase in the state's operations
 Efforts made to reconstruct the capitalist relations of production in the post-khomeini period of economic liberalization reversed some of the earlier trends
 The post-second Revolution period saw an increase in the polarization of workers and the non-peasantization of agriculture

 a 2
1 khz allocation, the 136 khz band, is available to amateur radio operators in some countries in Europe, New Zealand and French overseas dependencies
 The world record distance for a two-way contact is over 10,000 km from near Vladivostok to New Zealand
 As well as traditional Morse code many operators use very slow computer controlled Morse code or specialized digital communications modes
 a proposal at the WRC-07 World Radiocommunication Conference aims to make this a worldwide amateur radio allocation
 The UK allocated a 2
8 khz sliver of spectrum from 71
6 khz to 74
4 khz beginning in April 1996 to UK amateurs who applied for a Notice of Variation to use the band on a noninterference basis with a maximum output power of 1 w ERP 
 This was withdrawn on 30 june 2003 after a number of extensions in favor of the European-harmonized 136 khz band
 a 1-watt transmission of very slow Morse Code between G3AQC and W1TAG spanned the Atlantic Ocean for 3275 miles on November 21-22, 2001
 In the United States there is a special license free allocation in the longwave range called lowfer
 This experimental allocation between 160 khz and 190 khz is sometimes called the "lost Band"
 Unlicensed operation by the public is permitted south of 60 degrees north latitude, except where interference would occur to ten licensed location service stations located along the coasts
 Regulations for use include a power output of no more than 1 watt, and an antenna / ground-lead length of no more than 15 meters, and a field strength of no more than 4
9 microvolts / meter
 Also, emissions outside of the 160 khz – 190 khz band must be attenuated by at least 20 db below the level of the unmodulated carrier
 Many experimenters in this band are amateur radio operators
 a regular service transmitting RTTY marine meteorological information on LF is the German Meteorological Service 
 The DWD operates station DDH47 on 147
3 khz using standard ITA-2 alphabet with a transmission speed of 50 baud and FSK modulation with 85 Hz shift
