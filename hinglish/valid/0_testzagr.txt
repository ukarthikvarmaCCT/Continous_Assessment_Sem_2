 isse gharshan or taap janan, parichaalan shor or kampan ko kam karne ke saath sataha shram ko kam karne kaa laabh miltaa he
 Lubricants achieve this in many ways
 sabase saamaanya he bhautik baadha ke gathan dwaara, arthath gatisheel hisson ko lubricant alag karata he
 This is called hydrodynamic lubrication
 ucch sataha ke dabaav yaa taapmaana par drav kii parat bahut patali hoti he or lubricant ke madhyam se satahon par kuch bal preshit hote hai
 This is called elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication
 aam taur par lubricant-se-sataha gharshan bina lubricant kii kisi bhi pranali main sataha-se-sataha gharshan se kam hota he
 Thus the use of lubricant reduces the friction of the overall system
 kam gharshan kaa laabh he kam taap janan or ghisne vaale kanon kaa kam gathan or saath hi unnat dakshata
 lubricant main yojak shaamil ho sakate hai jinhen gharshan sanshodhak kehete hai jo sataha ke gharshan ko kam karne ke liye rasinic taur par thos satahon ko baandhte hai, us samay bhi jab hydrodinamik lubrication ke liye aparyaapt thok lubricant maujuud ho, udaa

 Both gas and liquid lubricants can transfer heat
 tathaapi, taral lubricant apane ucch vishisht taap kshamta ke kaaran or adhik prabhavi hai
 Generally, the liquid lubricant operates in and out of the cooler part of the system, although lubricants may be used for heating and cooling when a controlled temperature is required
 This circulating flow also determines the amount of heat that goes away in the unit at a given time
 ucch pravaah pranaliyaan bahut zyada garmi le ja sakati hai or lubricant par thermal tanaav ko kam karne kaa atirikt laabh bhi uthaa sakati he
 In this way low-cost liquid lubricants can be used
 praathmik dosha yah he ki ucch pravahon ke liye aam taur par vishaal haudi or bade shitalan ekakon kii aavashyaktaa he
 a minor drawback is that the high flow system that relies on the flow rate to protect the lubricant from thermal stress is susceptible to catastrophic failure upon sudden system shutdown
 ek automotive oil-kuld terbo charger ek theth udhaaharan he
 Turbochargers become hot red during operation and the oil that cools them remains because their time in the system is very short ie high flow rate
 If the system is stopped abruptly, the oil in the turbo charger is immediately oxidized and will block the oil passages including deposits
 These deposits can completely block the oil passages, reducing cooling over time, resulting in a complete shutdown of the turbo charger, usually with jam bearings
 greez or paste jaise pravaahit na hone vaale lubricant taap antaran ke samay prabhavi nahin rahete hai, haalanki pehle to ve taap janan ko kam karte hue yogadan dete hai
 Lubricant transmission systems have the advantage of taking away internally generated debris and external contaminants coming into the system, which reach the filter from where they can be removed
 mashiinon ke liye lubricant jo niyamit rup se malbe yaa dooshit padaarth janit karte hai jaise ki automotive ingine, aam taur par inamen malba or dooshit padaarthon ko filter tak pahunchane or hataane ke liye disergent or chhitare hue yojak shaamil hote hai
 Over time the filter will fill up and need to be cleaned or replaced, so it is recommended that you change the oil filter while changing the oil in the car
 In closed systems such as gear boxes, the filter may include a magnet supplement to attract the fine iron shreds generated
 yah spasht he ki ek sanchaar pranali main tel keval utana hi saafe ho saktaa he jitna ki filter use bana saktaa he, is prakaar yah durbhagyapurna he ki koi udyog maanak maujuud nahin hai jinase upabhokta sugamawa se vibhinn automotive filtaron kii chaanane kii kshamta kaa moolyankan kar saken

 Some manufacturers, who are looking for the "best of both worlds" solution, have built card readers that reach the size and appearance of USB flash drives
 These readers are limited to a specific subset of memory card formats and often Fully encapsulate the card, giving it stability and portability, even if not quite the same as a flash drive

 Most flash drives use USB, but some flash drives use other interfaces such as IEEE 1394, their one theoretical advantage over USB is the minimal latency and CPU usage provided by the IEEE 1394 protocol, but in practice, All IEEE 1394-based flash drives manufactured due to the proliferation of USB interfaces use the older slow flash memory chip and no manufacturer, such as 2009 Nick sells IEEE 1394 flash drives with fast flash memory and currently available models go up to only 4GB, 8GB or 16GB depending on the manufacturer

 iskaa matlab yah he ki ek esata flash drive ko abhi bhi ek uplabdh USB port yaa bijli ke kuch anya bahya strot kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 Additionally, as of September 2009, esata is still a fairly uncommon interface on most home computers, so very few systems can currently use the enhanced performance offered via the esata interface on such equipped flash drive devices

 jayakaantan ke pachaas ke dashak main, jab tamil kahani ke praangan main padaarpan kiya, sahitya-jagat sankatpurna ghadi main guzar rahaa tha
 The empire of great magazines, claiming a large readership, was established and creative genius was covered with this mist
 ye vyavsaayik patrikas tathaa kathith janaruchi kii aad lete hue vigyapanbaaji kii hode main saste manoranjan kii saamagree chhapane lageen
 As a result, true litterateurs preferred to leave these papers and write in small magazines
 yah alag baat he ki unhen apane lekhan ke badale main kuch bhi nahin mila
 By the next decade, commercial papers decimated small-magazines
 srujanaatmak lekhan ke kshetra main ek tarah kii sthirataa aa gayi
 In such an odd situation, Akhilan and Jayakantan's names are particularly notable among the writers who made their mark in fiction
 akhilan ke lekhan main romance liye hue adarshavaad kaa palada baari dikhataa he jabaki jayakaantan kii kahaniyon main kathankon kii vividhta, samasyaon kaa yatharth chithran or prastutikaran kii takanic nayi bulandiyaan chhu rahi hai
 One similarity found between Akhilan and Jayakantan is that the two never compromised their self-esteem while writing in professional journals
 jayakaantan is vishay main ek kadam aage hi rahe
 The commercial journals in which his stories were printed stood on the stage and roared with sattvik fury against him
 vamapanthi vichaardhaara kii patrika main jis samasya par likhte, usee ko or adhik tikhe shabdon main vyavsaayik patr main likhane kaa saahas unamem he
 To understand the continuity of Jayakantan's dominance in Tamil fiction, a discussion of the history of his later era is necessary
 sundar ramswami jayakaantan ke samakaleen hai
 In the words of critic Venkata Swaminathan, "both the storytellers were rich in self-study and influenced by leftist ideology in early writing
" ab vamapanthi siddhanth ke saath unki pahchaan nahin kii jaati, aise main unki samanta yaheen samaapt ho jaati he
 Sundar Ramaswamy's works are more refined with palatable humor; But he writes only occasionally
 jayakaantan mukhar, gambheer or aakraamak tevar ke lekhak hai jo prachur maatra main likhte hai
 In the decades of sixties and seventies, Jayakantan was considered as Savyasachi among Tamil writers

 lager ek aisi takanic ke rup main viksit hui he jiske sahare aaj aadhunik jagat ke anek kaary siddh hote hai
 Laser was invented about 50 years ago
 aadhunik jagat main lager kaa prayog har jagah miltaa he – vaigyanik prayogshaalaon, supermarket or shopping malls se lekar aspataalon tak main bhi
 In the entertainment world, the laser is only useful in the function of dvds, in guiding aircraft in the security and military fields, in locking cannon and guns, in the field of medicine, in dentistry and in laser and eye and other physical operations, In office work, the document printing by laser printer is carried only by optical fiber cables in the field of operation

 Skavlo and Towns also designed an open resonator, unaware of the published work of Prokhorov and Gould
 "lager" shabd ko pehali baar saarvajanik rup se gould ke 1959 ke sammelan patr "da lager, lite emplification bai stimulated emishan of radiation" main istemaal kiya gaya
 Gould intended to use the prefix "-ser", a prefix appropriate to the spectrum of light emitted by the device
 No other term became popular, although the term "razor" was radio for some time
 Known as the frequency emission device

 This sequence is so logical that the International Phonetic Association adopted this sequence with minor changes to create an international phonetic script

 Generally, in the north-western borders of the region, Kharoshthi was propagated in ancient times
 duusari lipi "brahmi" kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 According to the traditional belief of Indians, Sanskrit language and Brahmi script were introduced in the early era by the creator "brahma"
 kadachit is kalpana yaa manyata kaa aadhaar "brahmi" naam he
 "amarkosh" by "brahmi Tu Indian language Girvagwani Saraswati" indicates a broad vision of the meaning of the term "brahmi"
 yah shabd "saraswati" kaa bhi or "bhashaa" kaa bhi abhidhaan he
 But modern historians of East and West do not believe in these mythological and traditional theories

 Dr

 buler, "botleik" or "roth" ne bhi pratyaksh athwa paroksh rup se bharat main lipikla kii pracheenta sweekaar kii he
 Colebrooke Cunningham, Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha etc

 brahmi kii utpatti ko vidwaanon kaa ek varg abhartiya maanata he
 Second class Indians
 duusare varg ke log iskaa vikaas swatantra rup main bhartiya seemaa ke bheetar hi maanate hai
 Here, based on the articles of currency available from Harappa and Mohenjodaro, the script of Sindhughati civilization explains the origin of "brahmi"
 kuch saahasik vidwaanon ne sumeri, sindhughati or vaidic arya- teenon sabhyataaon ko ek mul strot se viksit maanakar kisi ek lipi se athwa pracheenatam sumeri lipi se brahmi ke udbhav kaa anumaan kiya he
 But this opinion is still serious for consideration
 sindhughati kii lipi brahmi or kharoshtee donon se vicitra or bhinn lagati he
 In conclusion, it can be said that according to the opinion of most Indian pundits, "devanagari" has developed from that "brahmi" which was in BC
 Was practiced in India for thousands of years and was developed in India and by Indians themselves
 bhartiya bhashaaon main sanganak par kaary karne ke liye unki lipiyon kii buniyadisamajh aavashyak he
 There are two types of alphabets in the alphabet
 vyanjan ve varna hai jinhen ek akeli ikai ke rup main bina swar kisahayta se uccharit nahin kiya ja saktaa, jabaki swaron kaa uccharan swatantraroop se yaa vyanjan ke saath jodakar kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, if we pronounce 'k'avarna alone, it will definitely have the vowel sound' a 'with the consonant sound' k '
 jabaki swar dhwani `a' kaa uccharan swatantra rup se kiya jaasakata he
 While speaking, we pronounce the sounds coming in a sentence or word in series
 in uccharit dhvaniyon ko yadi ham vyanjanav swar varnon kii sahaayta se krambaddh tareeke se likhen to hindi shabd `kamala'kuch isprakaar se likhaa jayega : Here, each consonant and vowel is spelled differently
 is likhaneke tareeke main visheshta yah he ki isamen varnakshar vyanjan or swar uccharankram ke anusaar likhe gayi hai
 When the words pronounced in the word are written in alphabetical order by the characters, this method is called descriptive marking
 varnatmak chihnavali samajhane main saral hoti he tathaa bhashaa ko lipibaddh karne kidisha main ise pehla swaabhaavik kadam mana ja saktaa he
 It is also suitable for typing
 kintu isaki kami yah he ki isamen likhnaa zyada padataahai jiske kaaran samay or kagaz donon hi kaa zyada kharch hota he
 The English kiroman script is a descriptive marking
 angrezi main 'kamala' dhwanikram isprakaar likhaa jayega : kamala varnatmak chihnavali kii uparokt kamiyon ko dur karne ke liye bhartiyabhashaon main aksharatmak chihnavali kaa vikaas kiyagaya he
 Under it, for each syllable syllable, there is a symbol cowpe, called a letter
 swarant syllable se arth he shunya, ek yaa usase adhik vyanjanon ke baad swar se milakar banane vaala varna-kram
 For example, the following alphabetical order is syllable: - shabd ke ant main, antim vyanjanon ke kram main swar na hone par bhiuse akshar ke rup main likh sakate hai; udaahranarth hindi main praayah shabdke antim vyanjan ke swar kaa uccharan nahin hota parantu likhit rup main vahaanpurnakshar kaa prayog hota he
 Such as: Lotus
 atah, akshar ek yaa adhik varnon ko pradarshit karata he
 One important thing in the structure of a letter is that the shape of the letter consists of the size of the quantities of consonants
 atah inhen siikhnaa aasaan he
 
 varnatmak va aksharatmakachihnavali ke kuch saral udhaaharan hai:- The main thing in this is that a "simple" letter was made by adding the vowel 'a' with the consonant
 udaahranarth : yahan `k' pratik he ek saral akshar kaajo 'k' vyanjan va acarant swar ke milane se bana he 
 Under this sign, the quantities were developed for the use of vowels in the consonants
 yadi vyanjan ke baad `a' ke atirikt koi anya swar aata he tiikshar par ek chota sa vishesh chihn laga diya jaataa he jo us swar kaa dyotkahai
 This sign is called the volume of that vowel, such as the quantity of 'U', 'U', the quantity of 'A', 'E', the quantity of 'E', etc
 jab vyanjan ke baad `a'swar aata he to kisi bhi atirikt nishaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 For example, uparokt main `kii' va `kai' ke antar par gaur kiijie
 'ki' has the amount of vowel 'e' on 'a' while 'many' has 'a' and 'e' in alphabetical form
 atah, matraaon ko akshar par ankit kiya jaataa he chaheykshar saral ho yaa sanyukt
 There are specific places to place each quantity, which are around the letter
 jaise:- To the left of the letter comes the quantity of 'I', similarly 'A' and 'A' quantities come up, 'U' and 'U' are below and on the other right
 yah tarika,hast-lekhan ke liye ati laabhprad he
 But there are some difficulties in terms of typing, which we will mention later
 itnaa karne se likhnaa bahut saral vasankshipt ho jaataa he
 Yes, it is a bit hard to learn, because now quantities also have to be learned
 is avishkaar kaa ek parinaam yah he ki ek saral akshar main 'a' kii anupasthitipradarshit karne ke liye ek vishesh maatra lagaani padati he, jise ham halantakahate he
 For example, the word 'a' in the word 'what' has to be stirred: duusari mukhya baat yah he ki jab kisi shabd main vyanjan ek ke baad ek aate hantab unhen ek saath jodakar likhaa jaataa he jise sanyuktakshar bhi kehete he
 The volume is applied to this conjunct, corresponding to the vowel that comes next
 udaahranarth,`kya' shabd main shuddh vyanjan `k' tathaa akshar `ya' he jinhen kram se jodakar`ky' sanyuktakshar banaaya jaataa he
 After that according to the general rule, the quantity of 'A' is imposed on it
 aitihaasik drushti se is tarah kii yogic syllabic-chihnavali,ek kranti se kam nahin he
 This is our familiar modern script
 aksharatmak chihnavali main maatra lagane kaa niyam saral va sanyukt donon hiprakaar ke aksharon par ek samaan lagu hota he
 This means that whether the letter is simple or combined, the quantity will be applied according to the rules given above
 yani `i' kii maatra niyamanusaar byinor lagati he to vah dono prakaar ke aksharon main baayin ore hi lagegi, jaise:-k+i=k+i=ki
 And the same rule also applies to conjuncts, due to which the quantity of 'E' will be written on the left side of the ligature
 neeche diye sanskrit shabd`tasmin' main sanyuktakshar `smi' par dhyaan dijiye:- The 'I' quantity moves to the left of the ligature 'sm', not to the left of 'M', which is according to the rules
 matraayen lagane ke niyam ke antargat prayek akshar ko ek chihnatmakaikai ke rup main liya jaataa he
 The letter itself is incomplete without vowels
 saral akshar maatr ek swar kaa, athwa ek vyanjan + ek swar kaa yoga hota he or sanyuktakshar ek se adhik vyanjan va ek swar kaa yoga hota he
 Similar to the rules for applying quantities, adding recipes to form conjuncts is also simple but special rules are: - The dishes are added from left to right, or top to bottom
 jisamen kram main pehla vyanjan baayin orya upar kii ore hota he
 We have already seen examples from left to right like, 'ky', 'sm' etc
, the examples of adding up and down are given below: - uparokt main chunki 'd' ke pashchaat 'dh' aata he, atah 'da' upar va 'dha'neeche likhaa jaataa he
 When making the conjunct, the second consonant symbol should be written to the right, ie, it depends on how the form of those consonants
 rupake anusaar hi unhen uchit tareeke se jodne main aasaani hoti he
 If there is no standing in the signs of both the vaults, then the second is written below the first, like 'tath'
 `r' ke saath kuch vishesh niyam he jo sankshiptata kii drushti se banaaye gayehain
 These rules depend on the location of 'su' in the sequence of conjuncts
 agar `r' duusare sthaan par he or uske pehle koi vyanjan tathaa baad main swar haito sanyuktakshar banaate samay `r' ke liye pehle vyanjan ke neeche ek vishesh chihnalga diya jaataa he:- Similarly, if there is a consonant after 'su', then a special mark is placed on that consonant: atah sanyuktakshar main `r' vyanjankram main pehle hone par upar tathaa baad memhone par neeche aata he
 Another way in our script to write concisely: - This is the use of Anusvaraka
 prayek vyanjan ke varg main antim vyanjan ke liye, anuswaar kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he, jaise:- Anusvara is used for nasal nasality of consonants and nasal is used for nasal nasality of vowels
 udhaaharan ke liye: Of these, the Chandrabindu marks the nasality of the vowels, but the sole purpose of the point is to bring brevity to the script
 yahan yah kahana aavashyak he ki bhashaa kii drushti se shuddh vyanjan va shuddh swarke madhyam se hi vishleshan karnaa sahi he
 According to the ISCII standard, articles are kept in the computer only in an alphabetical mark
 usamenmatraayen bhi shaamil hai
 But for language processing, they can be removed and converted to pure speech and voice easily
 anuswaar kii tarah ke niyam anya bhartiya bhashaaon main bhi hai
 There is a similarity in all Indian languages due to the same alphabetical and alphabetic script
 kisi ek bhashaa kii lipi kaa computarikaran hone par anya bhartiya bhashaonka computarikaran aasaan he
 The technology applied on one can also be used in computerization of other languages
 jaise jist praudyogikikamputer par sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon kii lipiyon main ek saath kaary karti he
 The keyboard is used for typing in computers, whose design depends on the size of our fingers and the length of hands
 atah kunjiyon kii banaavat va aakaar main atyadhik parivartan nahiho saktaa
 When there are more keys, it becomes difficult to find and remember the keys
 atah ek sanyuktakshar kaa ek hi kunjee se tankan karnaa mushkilav alaabhprad he
 There were many difficulties in typing on a machine typewriter made before the arrival of computers
 pehali to yah ki yadi ham chaahate hai kitip kii hui saamagree aksharatmak-chihnavali main dikhe, to usee chihnavalimen use tip karnaa anivaary he
 Therefore, many symbols including conjuncts had to be memorized on the keyboard
 doosraa, chunki matraayen akshar ke chaaron ora sakati hai, atah aisi mashin bananaa to jatil kaary tha hi, saath hi output sundaranheen dikhataa tha
 In view of all this, it was thought in computer technology that if we could do typing in descriptive markings, but it would be good to see the familiar alphabetical markings on the computer screen
 isi ko aadhaar maanakris praudyogiki kaa safal vikaas kiya gaya he
 All these shortcomings have been overcome by the advent of computers
 parantu yah aavashyak he ki ham varnatmak va aksharatmakachihnavali main parsparik sambandh ko samajhen
 This question may also arise in the mind that if the descriptive script Koman was taken for typing, all these problems would have gone away
 parantu chunki hast-lekhan main aksharatmak lipi prachlit thi, atah varnatmak lipi kaa upyogkarne kaa sochaa nahin gaya
 This is an example where, being a better science, technology was not used because it had not yet reached that level
 shaayad isi karanvash chhapakhane kaa bhi prachlan utananhin hua jitna hona chahie tha
 The loss we suffered from not using this technology is well known
 shaayad yah bhi ek kaaran tha ki europe ham se vigyaan main aage nikal gaya
 Now these things can only be estimated, it is difficult to say for sure
 prashn uth saktaa he ki yadi akshar shuddh vyanjan va swar kaa yoga he to matrakya he? m + i = mi kyon hota he `mi_' kyon nahin ? inkaa uttar ekaganitiya sameekaran ke rup main neeche diya ja rahaa he
 Here we will refer to the relation of quantity and vowel signs as a mathematical equation
 maatra sahit va maatra rahit chihnawaliyon ke kai udhaaharan ham dekh chuke hai
 like:- hamen yah bhi pataa he ki 'k' ko shuddh vyanjan va swar main toda ja saktaa he:- The value of 'A' above can be placed in the equation to the right: - isi prakaar se, sameekaran ke donon ore se 'k' ko gata sakate hai,thik vaise hi, jaise ganit ke udhaaharan main 8 ko gata diya gaya he
 And by removing 'K' from both sides, we get: - uparokt ek mahatvapurn sameekaran he, jo 'i' swar kaa mulya apanimatra ke rup main detaa he
 In the above, the value of the vowel 'I' is written in quantities
 ab ham matraake mulya ko swar main pradarshit karengen
 Let's first look at the mathematics equation
 sameekaran ke baane hisse menyadi ham shunya jod den to hamen miltaa he:- Now if you place 0: - 1 + then: - isi prakaar se ab dekhte hai ki maatra kaa apane swar se kya sambandhhai
 To detect this we would need a zero of the script
 hamajaante hai ki halant 'a' ko ghataata he, arthath:- Now by adding zero after 'Q' to the left side of the equation, we get: - donon ore se 'k' ghataane par, Or, you can write it like this: yah sameekaran pradarshit karata he ki maatra `i' kaa mulya he halant jamaa 'i'
 That is, 'E' contains the halant and he subtracts 'A' from the letter before him
 upar jo baat `i' ke liye kahi gai he, waisi hi baat anya matraaon ke liyebhi lagu hoti he
 Hence: halant ek prakaar se ek rinatmak vastu he, thik vaise hi jiseki rinatmak sankhya 
 Just as adding a negative number to a positive number reduces the value of the positive number, similarly adding a halant to a letter preceding it reduces the value of it
 halant kaa prayog, bhartiya bhashaaon kii visheshta he
 Halant was invented in India, and perhaps this type of concept is not in any other language
 bharat main bhashaa par vishesh rup se kaary hua he, thik vaise hi jaise ki yunaan main gyomiti par
 India gave the concept of zero to the world, and in view of all this it seems that it would not be surprising if the concept of zero in India developed in language and went to mathematics
 aethonolog vishwa kii bhashaaon kii ek suchi he jiskaa prayog bhashavigyaan main aksar kiya jaataa he
 Each language and sub-language is nominated with three different English letters
 is namakan ko "sil code" kaha jaataa he
 For example, the standard Hindi code code is 'hin', 'bra' of Braj language, 'bns' of Bundeli and 'kas' of Kashmiri
 har bhashaa or upbhasha kaa bhashaa-parivaar ke anusaar vargeekaran karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya he or uske maatrubhaashiyon ke vaasakshetra or sankhya kaa anumaan diya gaya he
