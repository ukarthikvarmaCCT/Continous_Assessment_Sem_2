 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom
 isi sadanrbh main usne “shakti ke pruthakkaran” kaa siddhanth diya jiske anusaar shashan ke teen pramukh ang-karypalika, nyaaypalik or vyavasthapika ko alag-alag haathon main rakhane kii salaah di
 He described the Government of England as ideal because there was a constitutional monarchy whereby the citizens were at liberty there
 is prakaar montescue ne shakti ke pruthakkaran ke madhyam se france kii nirankush raaj vyavastha par chot kii uske ye vichaar itane lokapriy hue ki 'da spirit of laaj' ke teen varshon main chah sanskaran prakashit hue
 It is to be noted here that Montescue neither talked of revolution nor the abolition of the monarchy, he just exposed the faults of autocratic monarchy and talked about constitutional monarchy
 waltare ne apni pustakon ke letters on inglish madhyam se britain kii udaar raajnneeti, dharm or vichaar swatantraaa kaa vishad chithran kiya tathaa puraatan francisi vyavastha se uski tulana kii or france main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kamiyon kaa ullekh kiya
 These books became very popular before being banned
 “waltare” ne carch ke bhrasht achaaran, ashishnutaa, anyaay, daman or atyaachaar ke virodh main likhaa
 Pointing fingers at the corruption of the church, he wrote that there is no Christian left because there was only one Christian and he was crucified
 usne likhaa ki kukhyat evam badnaam cheez ko kuchal do
 This was clearly an attack on the tyrannical monarchy of France and the tyranny of the Church
 waltare england ke sanvaidhanik rajtantr ke anuroop hi france main bhi vaisaa hi shashan sthapit karnaa chahta tha

 ruson ne kaha ki samuhik ichha se bane rajya kaa yah anivaary tathaa saarvbhaum kartavya he ki vah saare samaaj ko sarvopari maanate hue kaary ko sanchalit karen
 The people who have been entrusted with executive power are the executive, not the owner of the people, and their duty is to obey the orders of the people
 is tarah uskaa drudh vishwaas tha ki sarvopari satta janata ke haath main honi chahie kisi kisi ek vyakti yaa sanstha ke haath main nahin
 Sovereign power is rooted in the will of the people which is called "common will"

 The Russians also did not talk of revolution but considered all people as free and equal and the slogans of the French Revolution were influenced by his ideas of freedom, equality and fraternity
 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year

 The farmers hoped that by raising their voice against feudal privileges, they would be able to secure their rights and be free from their exploitation cycle
 is tarah francisi rajtantr kaa samarthan karne ke liye francisi jansankhya kaa koi mahatvapurn bhaag taiyaar nahin tha
 In the session of the Estates General, there was a dispute between the third state and other states on the issue of voting system
 matdaan ke bare main kaha gaya ki prayek state kaa ek hi mat mana jayega
 In this way, the privileged class has two and the public has only one opinion
 jansadharan ke pratinidhiyon ne arthath 'tritiy state' ne is matdaan pranali kaa virodh kiya kyonki isse ve bahut main hote hue bhi alpamat main aa jate
 The third state wanted the representatives of the three categories to sit together and decide by majority, but the clergy and the elite wanted separate meetings
 atah tritiy state ne stats general kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kar apane ko samast raashtra kaa pratinidhi maanate hue rashtriya sabha ke rup main ghoshit kar diya or paas ke tennis court main apni sabha bulaai
 The French Revolution reached its end through various stages

 At this stage the Parisian mob established control of the Bastille fort
 is tarah kranti kii shuruuaat hui
 In fact, the Bastille fort was a symbol of tyranny and tyranny and its fall posed a deep challenge to the archaic system
 is ghatana kaa prabhaav france ke gramin kshetron main bhi padaa or graminon ne saamanti karon ke abhilekhon ko aag laga di
 These proceedings of the public also had a profound impact on the National Assembly
 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights
 in adhikaron main swatantraaa, sampatti suraksha tathaa atyaachaar ke virodh kaa adhikaar aadi shaamil the
 In this way, the Constituent Assembly declared the fundamental principles, freedom, equality and dominance of the people
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko ghoshnaa patr main baar-baar duharaaya gaya
 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people
 yadhyapi shashan pranali rajtantratmak bani raheen parantu raja ke adhikaron ko simit kiya gaya
 He is no longer a lawmaker

 The authority to legislate was given to an assembly and its members numbered 745
 vyavasthapika ke sadasyon ke nirvachan ke liye nagarikon ko sakriy or nishkray do bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya gaya or matadhikaar keval sakriy nagarikon ko diya gaya
 Active citizens were those over the age of 25 who paid the state direct tax equal to three days' income while inactive citizens were those who were poor

 There was an Election Council to run the rule of each of the units, which were elected by active citizens
 is tarah sthaneey str se lekar kendriya str tak sari rajya vyavastha bargea varg main aa gai
 After the dissolution of the National Assembly, in 1791 AD, a 745-member administrative body came into existence
 is vyavasthapika sabha main adhyaksh ke daahine haath kii ore baithne vaale 'dakshinpanthi' kehalaae
 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this
 jacobiyan anushaasit or sangathit the
 He had influence on the Parisian crowd
 isamen pramukh netaa the- dante, robspier, heater aadi
 On the other side there were jirondists - these were educated and cultured people
 inhen kitaabi gyaan adhik tha
 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers
 antar keval swaroop kaa tha
 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality
 ve swatantraaa par adhik jor dete the
 On the other hand, the Jacobians emphasized more on equality and had a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army occupied Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control
 in vijayon se holland, austria, prasha or england ghabara gaye
 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places
 faltah videshi yuddh main france kii paraajay neshnal kanveshan ke samaksh ek mukhya samasya ban gai
 The National Convention passed a resolution that abolished the monarchy and established the republic
 raja par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or mrityudand kii sajaa di gai
 The policy of the Jirendistas on the question of the slaughter of the king was not clear
 ve rajtantr ke virdohi to the lekin vadh ke prashn par janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahe the
 In contrast, the Jacobians believed that the king's treason had been proved
 atah use mrityudand diya janaa chahie
 Finally, on 16 January 1793, Louis 16th was hanged
 neshnal kanvension ko jacobiyan or jirodishton ke bich sangharsh kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, France was beset by an economic crisis due to war, with prices soaring that the Convention enacted legislation to provide relief, a rule to collect debt from the rich
 in kadamon kaa jirondixton ne virodh kiya
 When Jacobio invaded the Convention with the help of the Paris mob and the commune, he took power and arrested Jirondisto and established a state of terror
 'aatank ke rajya' kii sthapana ke saath hi france ek baar punah avyavashtha kaa shikaar hua
 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians

 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed
 tritiy charan-1794-99 -“diarectory” kaa shashan vastutah neshnal kanvension ne ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan kar karypalika kaa uttardaayitv 5 sadasyeey “nideshak mandal” ko saunpa
 The rights of all the members of the board were equal
 prayek sadsy baari-baari se teen maheene ke liye adhyaksh hua karte the
 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France
 sanchaalak mandal ke saamne sabase pramukh samasya thi yuddh kii samasya, duusari taraf diarectory ke sadsy anubhavheen, ayogy tathaa bhrasht the
 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i
 main usne apane ko samraat ghoshit kar diya or is tarah nepolian ke taanaashaahee samrajyavaadee shashan kii shuruuaat hui
 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution
 kranti ke pratham charan main netritv tritiy state ke burjuai tatwon ke haathon main tha
 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property
 vastutah samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa to kar di gai kintu saamanti adhikaron ko yun hi nahin chhod diya gaya, balki bhumipatiyon kii kshatipurti karne ke baad hi kisaan kisi uttardaayitv se mukt ho sakate the
 Middle class influence can be seen in the Declaration of Human Rights
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko manushya ke naiysargik adhikaron kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya jo burjua hiton ke sangrakshan se sambandhit he
 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
 kranti ke dauraan krantikariyon ne nirankush sarkaar dwaara liye gaye rinon kii baat to kii kintu un rinon ko maaf karne kii baat kisi ne nahin kii
 The reason was that this loan was given to the government by the bourgeoisie
 isi prakaar sarkaar ne carch kii sampatti ko to jabt kiya parantu use bhoomihinon ko nahin baanta gaya
 The lands were sold at the highest prices and the middle class had the ability to buy this land
 francisi kranti ne mazdooron ke hiton ko najrandaaj kiya or shramik andolan ko hatotsahit kiya
 The working class played an important role during the revolution, but the bourgeois leadership did not approve of its growing position
 atah neshnal asembli ne nirankush rajtantr yug main nirmit kanoonon ko punah lagu kar diya
 Due to which all trade union related works were banned and guilds were declared illegal
 neshnal essembali main burjuaon kii pradhanta thi or usamen jirondist or jacobiyan bhi burjua varg se sambandhit the
 Although the Jacobians spoke of the interests of the proletariat, the establishment of a state of terror kept bourgeois interests above and army's help was taken to suppress the workers' reactions
 diarectory ke shashan main bhi madhyavargeey hiton ko pramukhataa di gai
 All members of the bicameral legislature that the governing board created were middle-class intellectuals
 nepolian ke sudhaaron par bhi burjuai prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 He protected the right to property in his code of law, preserving bourgeois interests, giving relatively broad rights to the nobles and the middle class benefited from its commercial and commercial reforms
 is tarah kranti ke swaroop main madhyavargeey tatv dikhaai dete hai
 But from the analysis of the entire revolution and its impact, it is clear that in the revolution there was co-existence of farmers, laborers, women with middle class elements
 is tareeke se yah maatr madhyavargeey kranti nahin thi apitu ek lokapriy kranti ke rup main ise dekha ja saktaa he
 The French Revolution took on a worldwide character
 krantikariyon ne 1789 main manushya tathaa naagarik adhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii, jiske tahat kaha gaya ki janm se samaan paidaa hone ke kaaran sabhi manushyon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie or yah sabhi deshon ke liye sabhi manushyon ke liye, sabhi samay ke liye or udhaaharan swaroop sari duniya ke liye hai
 This declaration was made not just for France but for the good of all people everywhere who wanted to be independent and to be free from the burden of autocratic monarchy and feudal privileges
 neshnal essembali dwaara 1792 i
 main compene naamak angeraj nayak ko francisi naagarik kii oopaadhi di gai or use neshnal kanvension kaa pratinidh bhi chunaa gaya
 Similarly, during the revolution, the idea was to expand the revolution to other countries of Europe to keep it stable and strong
 isamen ek aise yuddh kii kalpana kii gai jisamen francisi senaayen padosi deshon main pravesh kar vahaan ke sthaneey krantikariyon se milakar rajtantr ko apdasth kar ganatantron kii sthapana karti he
 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged
 dharm or raajnneeti ke pruthakkaran kaa mudda pehali baar is kranti ke dauraan uthaa
 State and politics were separated from religion
 vishwa itihaas main france kii rajya kranti ko vishisht mahatv praapt he yah maanav itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 In this, not only France, but also brought a priceless change in the life of Europe, in this, by destroying the feudal system that had been prevailing in the past, it gave way to modern democratic system
 rajtantr kii nirankushta samaapt hui or loktantric vaataavarna main logon ne chaiyn kii saans lee
 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
 or se dur karnaa chaahati thi
 Many philosophers and writers were born there who drew the attention of people to these sufferings through their writings, in spite of the worsening situation of other European countries, there was first a revolution against Louis Solven in France
 is kranti ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Changed form of French feudalism and improved status of farmers francisi kisaanon kii unnat avasthaa or samantvaad kaa badla hua swarup aisa kaaran tha
 This led to the first state revolution in France

 Rather, it became his policy to collect more taxes and exploit the public
 isliye france kii janata isse ub gai thi isliye france kii janata nirankush rajtantr ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi

 As a result, the usefulness of the nobility ended

 Hence the peasants and middle class people started hating the Kulinwarg
 anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 There still remained the father of the nobility

 Paris is considered the largest center of literature and thought in all of Europe
 france janamat anya europe rajyon kii apeksha adhik jaagrit or aalochanatmak tha
 As a result of all these reasons, in 1789 AD, there was revolution in France and not in other European states

 In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin gave the scientific theory of evolution through natural selection
 unhone ise apni kitaab jeevajati kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 The process of evolution by natural selection can be proved by the following observations: 1) more offspring are born than they can possibly survive, 2) the population has a variety of morphological, physical, and behavioral traits, 3) Different traits provide different chances of post-life and reproduction, and 4) traits are given from one generation to the next
 is prakaar, peedi dar peedi aabaadi un shakson kii santanon dwaara pratisthapit ho jaati he jo us baiophisical parivesh ke behatar anukulit hon
 The process of natural selection creates and retains traits with this virtual purpose that fit its functional role

 Other non-adaptive causes of micro-sequence evolution are mutation and genetic drift

 Main article: History of Evolutionism prastaav he ki ek prakaar kaa ek jeev duusare prakaar se utar saktaa he, kuch purv-secretic greek darshanikon jaise ki aneximundar or empodoclas main waapas jaataa he
 Such proposals survived into Roman times

 In contrast to these physical ideas, Aristotelianism regarded all natural things as the real forms of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms
 yah prakruti kii ek madhyayugin doorsanchaar kii samaj kaa hissaa tha jisamen sabhi vastuon kaa ek divya brahmadia kram main khilne ke liye ek mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real-type creatures always conform to each other for true spiritual forms, and especially new types

 In the 17th century, the new method of modern science rejected the Aristotlean view

 However, this new approach was slow to take root in biological science, the last bastion of the concept of definite natural types

 The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognized the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still in view of species determined according to a divine plan
 is samay ke anya prakrutivaadee samay par prakritik kanoonon ke anusaar prajatiyon ke vikasvaadi parivartan par anumaan lagaate hai
 In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertus wrote about the natural modifications that occur during breeding and accumulated over many generations to produce new species
 georges-louis leclerrk, comate di bamphone ne suzav diya ki prajatiyaan alag-alag jeevon main bighad sakati hai, or irasmus darwin ne prastaav kiya tha ki sabhi garm rakt vaale jaanavar ek hi sookshmjeev se utar sakate the
 The first fully developed development plan was jean-baptiste Lemarck's "transformation" theory of 1809, in which healthy generations consistently created simpler forms of life that developed more complexity with a progressive tendency inherent in parallel lineages, and localized At the level, these lineages can be adapted to the environment due to changes in their use or absence in the parents

 In particular, George Cuvre asserted that species are unrelated and determined, their similarities reflect divine design for functional needs
 Meanwhile, William Paly developed Red's ideas into natural theology or the god of existence and existence of Christians
 , Which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and was praised by Charles Darwin Did

 Partially influenced by an essay on the theory of population by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin stated that population growth can lead to a "struggle for survival" in which favorable variation prevails as others die
 prayek peedi main, kai santanon simit sansadhano kii vajah se prajnan kii umr tak jivit rahane main vifal rahete hai
 It can explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common lineage through the work of natural laws in the same way for all types of organisms
 darwin ne 1838 ke baad se "prakritik chayan" ke siddhant ko viksit kiya or is vishay par apni "badi kitaab" ko likhnaa shuru kiya jab alfred rasel wales ne unhen lagbhag 1858 main usee siddhant kaa ek sanskaran bheja
 Their separate papers were presented together at the 1858 meeting of the London Society of London

 Thomas Henry Huxley applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide convincing evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry
 kuch log is se pareshaan the kyonki yah nihit tha ki brahmad main manushyon kaa koi vishesh sthaan nahin tha
 The mechanisms of reproductive heredity and the origin of new traits remained a mystery
 is disha main, darwin ne pengenesis ke apana asthaayee siddhant viksit kiya
 In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that the elements were inherited in a predictable manner through independent classification and separation elements
 mandaal ke viraasat ke kanoonon ne antat darwin ke sabase adhik pengensis siddhant kii purti kii
 August Weismann has significant differences between germ cells that give rise to gametes and somatic cells of the body, showing that heredity only passes through the germ line
 hugo di vayiss ne verican ke rogaanu / som cell ke bhed ke liye darwin ke pengensis siddhant se judaa he or yah prastaav kiya he ki darwin ke penzen cell nabhik main kendrit the or jab vyakt kii gai to koshika sanrachana ko badalane ke liye ve koshika dravya main ja sakate the
 De Wills was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well known, assuming that Mendelian traits correspond to the transfer of genetic changes at the germline

 In 1973, the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobhansky wrote that "nothing in biology leaves the light of evolution", because it brought to light the earlier relationship to the contradictory facts of those natural relations, a knowledge of which Explains in clear explanatory body and many observational facts about life on this planet have been speculated

 insaanon main, udhaaharan ke liye, ankhon kaa rang ek viraasat kii visheshta he or ek vyakti ko unke mata-pita main se "bhura-aankh ke lakshan" kaa uttaradhikari ho saktaa he
 Hereditary traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's genome is called its genotype
 ek jeev kii sanrachana or vyavhaar ko banane vaale anokhi lakshanon kaa puraa set use fanotip kaha jaataa he yah lakshan paryaavaran ke saath apane ginotip ke sampark se aate hai
 As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited

 The Hardy – Weinberg theory explores how differences in population are maintained with Mendelian heritage

 However, relatively small differences in genotype can also lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differentiate in about 5% of their genomes
 mukhya lekh: utparivartan Repeat mutation of part of a chromosome is a change in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome
 jab utparivartan hote hai, ve ek jin ke utpaada ko badal sakate hai, yaa jin ko kaary karne se roak sakate hai, yaa iskaa koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 Based on studies in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, it has been suggested that if a gene changes the protein produced by the gene, it will likely be harmful, with approximately 70% of these mutations having a harmful effect, and the remaining neutral or weak forms

 Natural selection within a population for a trait, which can vary on a variety of values such as elevation, can be classified into three different types
 The first is directional selection, which over time is associated with a particular trait
 The average value changes — for example, organisms gradually become higher
 duusare, vighatnkaaree chayan atyadhik gun mulyon ke liye chayan hota he or aksar do alag-alag mulyon main sabase aam ho jaataa he, ausat mulya ke khilaaf chayan ke saath
 This will happen when either miniature or high organisms have an advantage, but not of medium height
 Finally, stabilizing selection involves choosing between extreme characteristics on either side, which is the average value and low diversity
 Reduces the variance around

 He has also demonstrated his Sanskrit knowledge from the texts composed by Vigraharaj and by his royal poet

 In the Prithviraj Raso Kavya, a poem called 'padmavatisamay' is also available
 rasokavy ke anusaar purv disha main samudrashikh naamak pradesh tha
 There Yadav dynasty was ruled by a king named Vijayapala
 uski patni kaa naam padmasen tha
 The daughter of both of them was Padmavati
 padmavati ek din rajbhavan ke udyaan main vicharan kar rahi thi
 At that time a shook was seen by him
 vah shuk atyant aakarshak tha
 The Shuk also considered Padmavati's blood balance as a bimble fruit and proceeded to eat it
 usee samay padmavati ne shuk ko apane haath main grahan kiya
 He was a scholar of human language
 vah padmavati kaa manoranjan karne ke liye anek katha sunaata rahaa
 After that, Padmavati curiously asked Shuk, "O Shukraj, where do you live? Who is the king of your kingdom?" Then Shuk began to describe his kingdom and Prithviraj in detail to eradicate the curiosity of Padmavati

 On hearing the praise of Prithviraj from the mouth of Shuk, Yadav Kumari Padmavati's mind became attached to Prithviraj
 parantu yauvan praapt padmavati kaa vivaah vijaypal ne kumudmani ke saath nirdhaarit kar diya tha
 Kumudamani was the king of the Kumaon region
 samudrashikhar pradesh main rajkumaari kaa vivaah kii sajjataa ho rahi thi
 Padmavati was distraught after hearing the news of her marriage on the other side
 uske pashchaat vah shuk ko boli, "he kir ! shuk ! aap sheeghra hi dehali jaakar mere priy prithviraj ko yahan bula laaie"
 After that Padmavati gave a letter to Shuk
 he kshatriya kulbhushan ! main tan man se aapako prem karti hoon
 If you consider me and my family to be worthy, protect me and take my life
 1130 shaksanvatsar ke baishakhmas kii shukladvadashi tithi ko meraa vivaah nishchit he

 --- padmavati Shuk went to Delhi by air and gave a letter to Prithviraj
 patr padhakar prithviraj ne samanton ke saath samudrashikhar nagar kii ore yatra prarambh kii
 On the other side, Kumudamani started the procession from Kumaon
 prithviraj samudrashikhar ja rahaa hai ye samachar praapt karke mohammad ghori ne bhi samudrashikhar kii ore yatra aarambh kii
 After that, Padmavati became very distraught after hearing the news of Kumudamani's arrival at sea
 kyonki prithviraj ke aagaman kaa samachar use nahin mila tha
 So she was crying while waiting on the passage of the Prada, looking at the road with a feverish heart
 usee samay shuk aakar use bolaa, "he sundari ! tere priyatam sameep ke shiv mandir main hai
 You soon there "
 shuk kaa vachan sun kar punerjeevan praapt padmavati ke netre achaanak chamak uththe
 After wearing a new cloth, bathing with fragrant water, wearing a shodash, she went to the pagoda with a lamp in a golden place with her sakhi
 shivalay pahunch kar shiv parvati kii puja karke prithviraj kii ore gai
 After that, after removing her mouthpiece, she became enchanted and looked at the beauty of Prithviraj
 prithviraj bhi thodaa aage jaakar padmavati ke sameep khadey ho gayi
 Seeing that view of the temple, the verdicts of Padmavati were surprised and seeing Padmavati and Prithviraj
 kyonki padmavati or prithviraj ke pranay ke vishay main shuk ko chhod kar koi bhi nahin jaanata tha
 After that, Prithviraj wrote the hand of Padmavati in his hand and performed the ashes
 dehali kii ore prithviraj or padmavati kii yatra kaa armbh hote hi samudrashikharnagar main sarvatra padmavatiharan kaa samachar vyaapt ho gaya
 Vijayapala and Kumudamani went after Prithviraj to fight with Prithviraj
 vijaypal or kumdamani ke aagaman kaa samachar sun kar prithviraj sasamant yuddh ke liye sajj ho gaye
 After that, the victorious Prithviraj started the journey towards Dehli in a destructive war
 parantu maarg main mohammad ghori ne apane sainikon ke saath prithviraj ke upar akraman kar diya
 But Ghori's army was severely defeated
 uske sabhi sainik yahan vahaan palaayan kar rahe the or prithviraj ne ghori ko bandi bana kar dehali kii ore prayaag kiya
 Upon reaching Dehli, Prithviraj got married to Padmavati in auspicious time in the temple of Durga
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, saahitiyik drushti se ukt katha kaa mahatva he, parantu aitihaasik drushti se ukt katha kaa mahatva nahin he
 Because nowhere in history is the mention of the fort called Samudrashikar and its king Vijayapala obtainable
 donon naam kaalpanik hai
 Historians are of the opinion that this legend will be a famous story from the Puranas, which, unknown to me, will be projected by an unknown person in Prithviraj Raso Kavya

 At that time Prithviraj's bravery was being praised in all directions

 After that she started loving them

 Hence Jayachand did not invite Prithviraj to the Swayamvara and installed the statue of Prithviraj in place of the gatekeeper
 duusari ore jab sanyogita ne janaa ki, prithviraj swayamvar main anupasthit rahenge, to usne prithviraj ko bulaane ke liye doot bheja
 Knowing that Sanyogita loves me, Prithviraj departed towards Kannauj city
 ashwamedhyagy ke pashchaat swayamvarkaal main jab sanyogita haath main varmala liye upasthit raajaaon ko dekh rahi thi, tab dwaar par sthit prithviraj kii murti ko usne dekha
 Sanyogita went near the idol and put it in the gorge of the idol of Varmala Prithviraj
 usee kshan prasaad main ashwaruji prithviraj pravisht hue
 He challenged all the kings for war with Sinharanad
 use pashchaat sanyogita ko le kar indrapastha prasthaan kar gayi
 After defeating Jayachanda on the way, Muhammad Ghori was imprisoned and Prithviraj reached Indrapastha with Sanyogita
 jayachand to apane apmaan ke pratishodh kaa vairoddhar karne ke liye prithviraj ke saath yuddh kiya
 But when Muhammad Ghori realized that Prithviraj was going towards Kannauj city, he had blocked the way to defeat Prithviraj
 prithviraj ne na keval mohammad ghori ko parajeet kiya, api tu us ko bandi bana kar indraprastha bhi le gayi
 When Prithviraj ascended the throne of Shakambhari, the Chauhan dynasty walked with the help of the generals of the empire
 saamantiya shashan pranali main sabhi samant swatantra se apane rajkosh kaa vyavasthaapan karte hai or vaarshik uphaar ke rup main apane samraat ko niyat dhanrashi pradaan karte hai
 During the war period, the feudal lords send their army according to the command of the emperor
 saamantiya shashan pranali main rajnatik ekta kii sthiti ati shithila hoti he
 Because soldiers who are engaged in war by the order of the emperor, they have loyalty to their king and not to their emperor
 samanton kii bhi apni mahechhaayen hoti hai
 Therefore, they are constantly trying to expand their sphere of influence
 jab samanton kaa samrat kisi yuddh main parrast hota he, maranasann hota he yaa nirbal hota he, tab samant apni swatantrata ke liye praytn armbh kar dete hai
 Knowing the reason for the emancipation of the emperor, he is also ready to attack his emperor
 rajsinghaasana par arurh prithviraj yuva the, atah anek samanton ne apni swatantrata ke swapn dekh kar yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di
 But with the help of Camas and Bhunacamall, Karporadevi suppressed those rebellious feudatories
 tatah vigraharaj ke dwitiya putr nagarjun ne ajayameru rajya ke uttaradhikari ke rup main vidroh kar diya
 When Prithviraj was ruling, Nagarjuna was living in exile in Yoginipur
 us samay yoginipur main nagarjun ke maatul tomaravansheey prithvipal kaa shashan tha
 The Tomar dynasty king Prithvipal was also a feudal of the Chauhan dynasty
 prithviraj vijay mahakavy ke dasham sarg ke shashtham or saptam shloke main ullekh he ki, bhaagyashaalee, balashaali vigraharaj kaa vivekshunya putr nagarjun ne gujpur ke upar akraman kiya tha
 The Tomar dynasty king Prithvipal did not have enough military power to attack Prithviraj
 parantu prithvipal kaa samarthan anya yadavavanshi bhadanak naamak samant ne bhi kiya
 Nevertheless, the combined army of both of them was also unable to face Prithviraj's 70,000 cavalry soldiers, Gajasainika and the officials
 harihar nivas dvivedi kaa mat he ki, sapadalaksh samraj kaa poorviy prativeshi rajya jejakabhukti or kanyakubj rajya ne bhi prithviraj ke viruddh yuddh karne ke liye prithvipal ko sainya sahaayta pradaan kii thi
 The statement of the Chauhan dynasty of Shakambhari was fought for the first time with the Yadav dynasties during the time of Ajayraj
 bijauliya ke shilaalekh main pandrahaven shloke main ullekh praapt hota he ki, shrimarg kaa or durdd pradesh ke abhiyaan kaal main chachig, singhul, or yashodhar ityadi veeron kaa vadh ajayraj ne kiya tha
 After that, Arnoraj and Vigraharaj also made statements with regional Yadav dynasties
 parantu ve sab yadavon ko samul nasht karne main safal na hue
 Immediately Nagarjuna revolted against Prithviraj, the then imperial territorial king Sohanpal Chauhan was adorned to fight against the dynasty
 atah usne apane sanybal se nagarjun kii sahaayta kii
 Vigharaj fought with Sohanpal's ancestor Kumarapala
 anuvanshik yuddh kii sthiti prithviraj ke shasankaal main api samudbhoot hui
 But Prithviraj destroyed the Yadav dynasties of the Bhadanak region
 bhadanak pradesh ke upari akraman karne se prak prithviraj ne apni shashan vyavastha main do mahatvapurn parivartan kiye the
 First, he removed the feudal lord of Hansipur and appointed his brother Hariraj as the feudatory of Hansidurg
 dwitiya kaary main unhone yoginipur main prithvipal ke riktasthaan main govind ko niyukt kiya
 And by making adequate defense arrangements of the main two centers of war, Prithviraj became adorned to answer the conspiracy of his opponents
 khartargachhpattavali ke 14 prishth par soochna prapya he ki, prithviraj ne digvijay abhiyaan ke liye narin pradesh main se prasiddh he

 Prithvaraja sent forward a team under the leadership of Bhuvanackamall to inspect the internal enemy territory
 uske pashchaat apane senapatiyon ke saath swayan vishaal sainya ko lekar digvijay abhiyaan armbh kiya
 Camas and Skanda were prominent among Prithviraj's commanders

 Yadavvanshi Sohanpal was defeated in that dreadful war

 The soldiers, who were alive, brought the Chambal river twenty-two kilometers from the town after Shikoha

 During the war, Chambalnadi started flowing in the Yamunanadi and Southeast direction in the east of the Sapalaksha Empire

 Hey Prithviraj! In what words can you describe your might and fame? Whose army pleased Vijayadevi from all directions
 jisane arne bhujabal se virodhiyon kii hastisena par aadhipaty sthapit kiya wo swastik chihn se yukt ho
 There are also names like Chedishesh, Darshana, Juzhoti, Kuntalesh etc
 of Jejak Bhakti
 sadyah jejakabhukti pradesh ko bundelkhand ke room main janaa jaataa he
 Although the vast territory of Bundelkhand has been divided between Madhya Pradesh and the state of Uttar Pradesh, yet that state is famous by the name Bundelkhand
 us bundelkhand main jejakabhukti naamak swatantra rajya tha
 Yamunanadi in north border of Jejak Bhakti region, Chambalanadi flowed in northwest direction
 dakshinpurv disha kii seemaa main bundelkhand kaa parvatiyasthal tha
 The cultural capital of Jejak Bhakti was Khajuraho
 jejajabhukti pradesh ke do samrik kendra the
 Firstly, the main capital, Kalinjar-nagar and the second Mahobagarh-nagar
 jejakabhukti rajya kaa nirmaan ati vicitra tha
 There were small forts everywhere
 un main kalinger, ajaigarh, bairigarh, mahoba, madpha ityadi mahatvapurn durg the
 In the year 1182, Prithviraj attacked Jejakabhukti
 prithviraj ke akraman se chakit shatru yuddh main parajeet hue
 a commander named Salkhan was appointed in Sirsadurga on the banks of Pahujanadi
 kaimash ne uskaa vadh kiya
 a brother named Malkhan of Salkhan was also killed by Kaimash
 sirsadurg jit kar yada prithviraj kii sena aakori naamak sthaan kii ore agressor thi, tabamaarg main hi chandrerisena ke saath bhayankar yuddh hua
 The warrior of Alma named Paramardidev was defeated in that battle
 atah usne van main sharan lee
 a warrior named Brahmajit was killed in that war
 uske pashchaat prithviraj ke akraman se paramardidev ke prasiddh senapati hutatma hua
 Paramardeva himself became disenchanted with the Chandel war and began to go undercover in Kalanjirdurg
 parantu prithviraj ne kaalanzirdurg par chaaron disha se akraman kar ke paramardidev ko aatmasamarpan ke liye vivash kiya
 When Prithviraj was with his army at Shibir in Madanpur, located near the place called Aeran in Malvapradesh, he got the news of Paramardev's surrender
 merutung ke prabandhchintaman main ullekh prapya he ki, "paramardidev ne apane mukh main trin sthapit kariya arthath, atyantadinta ko pradarshit kar prithviraj se jeevanabhiksha praapt kar gaya" 
 Prithviraj's inscriptions support Jejakabhuktivijaya also
 stambhah shambhunitambanipranatishu vyagro na dhaaturgrihe
asmakan paramardanosti vadane nyasten sangrakshitah
 Earth Verse 8, Part 1, Shargadharpaddhati: arthath shiv kii puja main mand he, krishnarchan main trishna nahin, durgako pranaam na kar stabdh khada he or vidhaataa rupi grah vyagr jiskaa aisa hamaara swami paramardidev trin mukh main santhaapit kar narpathi prithviraj se jeevandaan paane main safal hue
 Prithviraj's campaign of Jejak bhakti pradesh was successful
 parantu vah abhiyaan apurna hi tha
 Because Jejakabhukti was the mother of the native king of Chalukyasamrat, Naikidevi, the daughter of Parmardev, the queen of the country
 naikidevi kushalrajnneetigya api thi
 Therefore, knowing the state of his father's defeat, he invaded the Ajayameru kingdom to distract Prithviraj
 kootneet main prauji vah apane abhiyaan main safal api hui
 As Prithviraj heard the news of the invasion of the Ajmeru kingdom, he went to Ajayameru region, postponing the expedition to other regions of Jejakabhuktipradesh
 prithviraj raso kavy main ullekh he ki, yuddh main parajeet paramardidev ne dehtyag kiya
 But the last inscription of Paramardidev written in 1201 years is found
 atah us varsh tak to uske jeevanghatana kii pushti hoti he
 During the reign of Prithviraj's father Someshwar, Someshwar suffered from the Chalukyan dynasty Ajaypal
 prithviraj kii sena ne ratrikaal main hi abu pradesh par akraman kar diya
 But Prithviraj was not leading that campaign
 kyonki prithviraj to digvijay abhiyaan ke liye bhandanakpradesh or jejakabhuktipradesh main the
 An inscription written in 1239 Vikram Samvatsar obtained from Madanpur confirms this
 khartargachhpattavali ke anusaar prithviraj dwaara 1239 vikram sanvatsar main digvijayabhiyaan armbh karne ke liye narineshetra main apni sena ekatra kii thi
 Prithviraj was in the Vijayabhayana of Jedak Bhaktipradesh, when the Chalukyan dynasty Bhimdevdiyya invaded the Ajmeru kingdom to distract Prithviraj
 us akraman main bhimdev dwitiya dwaara sapadalaksh samrajya ke laghu bhubhag par aadhipaty sthapit kiya gaya tha
 That campaign of the Chalukyas was led by an officer named Jagaddeva
 parantu wo safalataa ati swalpakalin thi
 Two inscriptions were found from Charalugram, 22 km from Chhapar village, located at Agnekon in Bikaner city, in which those inscriptions give details of the Nagaur war
 un main ankit sanvatsar 1241 vikram sanvatsar he
 In the Tatra Nagaur Sangram, the souvenirs of those who received Veergati have been established
 khartargachhpattavali ke jaise tatraapi chouhan or chalukyavansh ke sandhi kaa ullekh miltaa he
 It is clear from the basis of the above facts that Jagaddev and Dharavarsha, the two commanders of the Chalukyas, got military success against the Chauhan dynasty in the early period and they were also successful in gaining the suzerainty over the kingdom of Sapadalaksha
 parantu uske pashchaat chouhan vansh ke saath hue dirghakaalin yuddh se sandhi kii sthiti samudbhoot hui
 It is mentioned in the Khartargachhapattavali, that Senapati Jagaddev was devastated by the long war with Prithviraj
 atah usne prithviraj ke saath sandhi kar lee thi
 In any way Jagaddev wanted a treaty with Prithviraj
 jagaddev kii sandhi se sambaddhit vivashtaa khartargachhpattavali main varnit ek ghatan se bahudhaa gyaat ho sakati he
 On page 43 of the Khartargachhapattavali, it is said that in 1244 Vikram Samvatsar, some of the nobles of Sapradalakasamrajya went to the state of Gujarat
 tambhayad naamak dandanayak ne unako lutane kii yojana banaai
 He also decorated his team for looting
 parantu itane mahatkaarya ko karne ke liye pradhanmantri kii anumati aavashyak he ye soch kar usne jagaddev ko patr likhaa
 Right now, a congregation of rich leaders of the kingdom of Sapadalaksha has come
 aapaki ajna se main unako lut kar dhan kii vyavastha kar saktaa hum? On reading this, Jagaddev became angry with anger
 unhone pratyuttar likhaa ki, i have just been able to make a treaty with Prithviraj with much difficulty
 atah main tumko chetavanee detaa hoon ki, yadi tune sapadalaksh ke kisi bhi jan ko peeda di,tarhi main tumhen gadhe ke pet main silava duungaa
 After reading the above letter, Dandanayak sent them well after receiving the best hospitality
 khartargachhpattavali ke is kathan kii pushti verawalprashasti bhi karata he
 In Jejakabhukti Pradesh, Prithviraj conquered, Ajayameru kingdom was invaded by the Chalukyan dynasty king Bhimdeva by order of Naikidevi
 atah prithviraj jejakabhuktipradesh ke anypradesh kaa vijayabhiyaan sthagit kar chalukyavanshiyon ke saath yuddh karne gayi the
 Prithviraj and Bhimdev fought for a long time
 1244 vikram sanvatsar main prithviraj kii vijay ke saath us yuddh kaa ant ho gaya
 The account of the Kharatagargachhapattavali, inscriptions from Jaisalmer, Nagaur, Badmer and Jodhpur and the Veravalprashsti give sufficient notice of the war results between Prithviraj and Bhimdev
 prithviraj raso kavy main ullekh he ki, prithviraj ne bhimdev dwitiya ko maar daalaa tha
 But even though Prithviraj died in the year 1192, the position of Bhimvedava II was till 1238, it is proved by the evidence
 mohammad ghori i
 1175 varsh main multan pradesh par aadhipaty prasthaapit kar usee varsh uchh pradesh par chal se aadhipaty sthapit kar chukaa tha
 After that, in 1182 AD, invading the southern Sindh region, he invariably established independence over Indus
 us se sapadalakshasamrajya kii or ghori dwaara shasit sandhupradesh kii seemaa samaan ho gai
 And Ghori became the ambassador and enemy of Prithviraj
 un donon ke paas shatruta ke apane kaaran bha the
 Prithviraj wanted to protect his territory, but it was necessary for him to repel the invaders of Turk
 duusari ore ghori kii vistaarvaadi niti ke maarg main prithviraj kantak samaan the
 Because the end of Prithviraj was the goal of Ghori to expand the territory of India
 prithvirajvijay main ullekh miltaa he ki, pashchimottar disha main jo ashwon ke liye prasiddh pradesh hai, us pradesh kaa gaumansabhakshi mlechh ghori naamak raja garjan desh main nivas karata he
 Hearing about that cowboy eater, Prithviraj pledged to destroy the mlechha
 prithviraj dwaara mlechhanaash kii jo pratigya kii gai thi, uske vishay main ghori bhi jaanata thaa
 Therefore, in the year 1177 AD, he sent his envoy to Ajayameru fort
 uske pashchaat ajayameru kii rajyasabha main takla doot upasthit hua
 While that messenger was present in Ajmeruprasad, then Nagarjunadaman festival was going on in Prasadad
 vidhaataa dwaara kapilavadh kii prashasti likhane ke liye hi uske lalaat kii rachana kii he ityadi vaakyon se us doot ke sapaat takley kaa uphaas prithviraj vijay mahakavy main praapt hota he
 It is further mentioned in Prithvirajvijay that the hair of his beard, the bruises and the hair of the eyelid were white in color in his region
 uske murdhanyavarna nasht ho chuke the
 That is, he was unable to pronounce the idols
 atah uski bhashaa pakshaon ke kalravawat pratibhashit ho rahaa tha
 His skin was looking leprosy
 usne krishnavarna kaa vicitra vastra dhaaran kiya tha
 After this, some verses are not received in Prithvirajavijaya epic
 atah doot kii ajayameru ke prasaad main upasthit kaa prayojan nischitatya gyaat nahin hota
 But upon hearing the words of the messenger, Prithviraj responded at once, those verses are available
 doot ke vachan sunakar prithviraj kii bheeshan pratikriya thi
 Prithviraj exclaimed in a high voice with great anger, "what shall i say to him? He knows with certainty that i have started the Vijayabhiyaan only to kill a cannibal like him
" ye jaanakar bhi wo mujhe, jise log "ajayameru kaa singh" aisa sambodhit karte hai, usko doot bhejtaa he"
 From the said wrathful words of Prithviraj, one can only guess the message of Ghori
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, us kaal main jaisi rajnatik sthiti thi, uske anugun to ghori ne prithviraj ko aatmasamarpan ke liye athwa sandhi ke liye sandesh bheja hoga
 Hearing the full offer from Ghori's tail, Prithviraj would have rejected that proposal, because the Chauhan dynasty and Prithviraj would have opposite messages from the self-respect
 prithviraj ke sapadalakshasamrajya kii seemaa kaa or sindhupradesh kii seemaa ke parivartit rajnatik sameekaran ke saath saath vikampur kaa bhi rajnatik mahatva batch gaya tha
 Because along the border of Vikkampur, the border of the Indus and Sapalaksha regions was included
 is prakaar vikampradesh kaa pashchimbhag sindhupradesh kii or purvabhag sapadalakshapradesh kii seemaa ko sparsh karne laga
 At that time, the Lokra dynasty was ruled by Vikrampur
 ukt rajnatik sameekaran main rashtrahit kii bali dekar lodrava vansheey raja jaisal ne raja ghori kii sahaayta kii
 Because with the support of Ghori, the Lodravana dynasty was ruled
 ghori ke saath prithviraj ke kitne yuddh hue, is vishay par vivaad he
 Because different historical figures are given in different historical literature
 parantu sarvatra un donon ke bheeshan yuddh kaa varnan uplabdh hota he
 The first war of Narayan and the second war of Narayan are famous
 pratham yuddh i
 1191 varsh main or dwitiya yuddh i
 1992 varsh main hua tha
 Prithviraj was defeated in the first war and Prithviraj was defeated in the second
 prithviraj raso kavy main ullikhit he ki, prithviraj ne teen baar ghori ko parjit kar dandit kiya tha
 Prithviraj had arrested Ghori seven times, this is found in Hammiramahakaavya
 prabandhkosh main varnit he ki, prithviraj ne bees baar ghori ko bandi kar chhod diya tha
 According to the Surjancharitamahakavya, Prithviraj punished Ghori twenty-one times
 prabandhchintamani granth ke anusaar taees baar prithviraj ne ghori ko jivit chhod diya
 The evidence of Prithviraj's war with Ghori is unavailable
 atah nishchit sankhya ke vishay main vivaad yathavat he
 But historians believe that Prithviraj and Ghori suffered numerous friction between them
 kahin laghu gharshan kutrachit bade
 Prithviraj was victorious in all friction
 atah sankhya to aspasht he, parantu prithviraj kii vijay kii nischitata sarvatra dikhaai gai he
 Prithviraj was defeated in the last war, ie in the second war of Narayan
 satluj kaa yuddh prithviraj kaa ghori ke saath prapratham yuddh tha
 In that war, Ghori was horrified
 us yuddh main ghori ke paraajay ke anantar hi parmarvansheey sur naamak samant prativarsh gazani pradesh kar lene jaataa tha
 The details of the Sutlejuddha are not received very often, so the two wars with Prithviraj's Ghori are illusions
 falvarddhika ke shilaalekh main sapramaan satlujayuddh ke vivaran kii pushti hoti he
 The subject of Sutlej war is mentioned in the third part of the epic of Hammir
 nyaaypurna shashan karte hue raja prithviraj ek baar rajsabha main baithe the
 At the same time, a king named Chandraraj appeared before Prithviraj
 vah chandraraj pashchimdisha ke raajaaon kaa pramukh tha
 They were frightened and demoralized by Rajagana
 kyonki ghori naam yanvaraja apane samrajyavistaar kii niti ko poshit karne ke liye anya pradeshon par akraman karata rahaa tha
 All the kings of Paschidadha, defeated by that Yanavaraja, expected help from Prithviraj
 prithviraj ne unke latake hue mukh dekh kar klesh kaa kaaran puchha
 Chandraraj said, "O Rajan! Yavanaraja, named Ghori from Paschidisha, has destroyed many kingdoms while outlawing other kingdoms
 usne jis rajya par akraman kiya, us rajya ke sabhi nagaron ko lut liya gaya or mandiron ko agnisaat kar diya gaya
 The women of the states were raped, due to its cruelty, the condition of those women has become extremely pathetic
 wo jis kisi bhi rajput ko sashastr dekhtaa he, use yamalok bhej detaa he
 Sadhya: Multan is the capital of Ghori
 " Hearing Chandraraj's word, Prithviraj stood indignantly and said, uske pashchaat prithviraj ne ati garv se apane hotho se muchho ko sahalaaya 
 After this, Prithviraj along with Chaturangini Sen attacked Multan
 vikampur or uchh pradesh ke madhya main ek vishaal bhukhand main prithviraj kaa ghori ke saath yuddh hua tha
 Historians believe that the war must have taken place in the year 1182–83
 chuki vah yuddh satluj nadi ke tir par hua tha, atah us yuddh kaa naam satlujayuddh padaa
 Ghori's army escaped from the war due to the invasion of Prithviraj's Vishal Sena
 prithviraj ne ghori ko bandi bana liya
 The pathetic condition of Ghori is not explicitly described in Hammiramahakaavya
 parantu vahaan ullikh he ki, prithviraj ke sammukh natmastak ghori tabaswatantra hua, yada usne prithviraj ko vaarshikkar dene kaa sankalp kiya
 Historians are of the opinion that Prithviraj symbolized keeping the commonwealth in mind and decided to go to war with Ghori
 us yuddh ke parinaam ghori ke liye bhayankar the
 Because after that war, Ghori became the taxpayer of Prithviraj
 prithviraj ke aadesh se parmarvansheey sur naamak samant prativarsh gazani pradesh jakkar kar sweekaar karata tha
 Once upon a time, the Turki people killed him
 parantu sur 74 turk sainiko ko markar mara
 After the death of Sur, Prithviraj appointed an officer named Pratapsingh to collect the tax
 parantu pratapsih swamibhakt or dharmachari nahin tha
 He was a slave to the Turks
 gazani pradesh se jo dhanan kar ke rup main prithviraj ke rajkosh main jaataa tha, us dhan kaa bada bhaag pratapsingh maarg main hi 'masjid' main or vahaan ke yawanon main daan kar detaa tha
 If anyone asked anything about charity, then he used to say that, i am giving donations for the removal of Earth's odd planet
 
 Prithviraj several times humiliated Ghori by imprisoning him
 prithviraj prativarsh ghori se dand ke rup main vaarshikkar sweekaar kiya karte the
 Shilalekha also confirms Prithviraj's taxation
 prithviraj ke kar sweekaran ke vishay main anek farsi kavion ne bhram samutpaadit kiya, parantu rajasthanrajya se falvardhika naamak shilaalekh se prithviraj kii kar sweekaran kii ghatana pusht ho jaati he
 The inscription was established at the time of renovation of the temple of Phalodidevi located at the place called Phalvardhika
 wo shilaalekh 1555 vikram sanvatsar ke chaitramas kii shuklaikadshi ko guuruuvaar ke din prasthaapit kiya gaya tha
 The ruler of Dahladesha was the Paramaravasi king Madhudeva
 uskaa yashasvi putr sur prithviraj kii ajna se prativarsh vaarshik dand swikaarne ke liye gazani pradesh jaataa tha
 Once he went alone to do it alone
 ekaaki sur ke upar ghori ke sainikon ne akraman kar diya
 The warrior Sur killed his life at 74 and finally gave up his life
 1177 varsh main prithviraj dwaara yada nagarjun kaa daman kiya gaya tha, tabanagarjun daman ke pashchaat ajmeru prasaad main utsav tha
 At that festival, Ghori sent a messenger to Prithviraj for a treaty or dedication
 yada ghori ne sapadalakshasamrajya main doot bheja tha, tab hi uski gujarat rajya par akram kii yojana thi
 Therefore, it was his desire to invade the state of Gujarat in collaboration with the Chauhan dynasty by forming the basis of the enmity between the Chalukyas and the Chauhans
 parantu prithviraj ke virodh karne par ghori swayan hi gujarat par akraman karne nikal padaa
 By acting on his military expansion policy for one year, he invaded Gujarat in the year 1178
 parantu gujarat rajya ke maarg main uchh pradesh aata tha
 Therefore, he attacked the Uchchha region first
 multan pradesh se bharat pahuche ghori ne uchh pradesh par akraman karnaa chaha
 But he was frightened by the Rajputs of Uttar Pradesh
 rajputon ke sammukh ghori kii vijay asambhav si thi
 Therefore, he planned to dominate the region from treachery
 ghori ko guptcharo se gyaat hua ki, uchh pradesh ke raja ke sambandh apni raji se saral nahin arthath unke sambandh main katutaa he
 So Ghori sent the message to Rajni
 us sandesh main usne likhaa ki, "yadi aap apane pati ko vish dekar maar daalen, tarhi main aapke saath vivaah karuunga"
 In response to Ghori's message, Rajini wrote, "I have grown old
 main vivaah karke kya karuungi? parantu meri putree ke saath aap vivaah kare to, main aapkaa eepsit kaary kar sakati hoon
 After receiving the response of Rajni, Ghori sent his consent letter
 kyonki uskaa uddesh uchh pradesh par aadhipaty sthaapan karnaa tha
 The subject of vivahadi was only part of its treachery
 tatpashchaat uchhpradesh kii raji ne apane pati ko vish dekar maar diya
 Locked the fort, treasury and armory and sent his key to Ghori
 is prakaar chal se or kapat se ghori uchh pradesh kaa adhipati ban baitha
 Ghori was the ruler of a small state, then he sent the princess and princess of the Uttar Pradesh to the Ghazni region
 yada rajkumaari ko apni mata kaa krity pataa chalaa, tabausane mata kaa tiraskaar kar diya
 Rajini gave up her life due to her disloyalty and hatred of her daughter
 uske pashchaat kuch din sansar ke dukh sah kar rajkumaari ne bhi deh tyaag diya
 Dr
 Habibullah is of the opinion that there is no evidence of the rule of Bhattirajas in Uttar Pradesh
 atah ebn aseer, yahiya sarhindi, nizamuddin ahamed, farist ityadi ke rachita ne is ghatana ko kalpinic kaha he
 But Ghori superseded the treachery over Uttar Pradesh, all historians are agreed on this subject
 uchhpradesh ke upar swadhipaty praapt kar ghori ne maarg main kiradu naamak sthal par sthit someswaramahadev ke mandir ko lut liya
 That temple of Shiva was famous in the state of Rajasthan at that time
 sundararatnon se alaakrut bhavy us mandir ko lut kar us mandir kaa purnataya naash karke ghori gujarat rajya kii ore aage badhaa
 And through the state of Sandrao, the Chauhans of Nadolia attacked the capital named Nadol
 us samay nadol pradesh par chalukyavanshayo ke samant klahanvansh ke raja shashan kar rahe the
 In that Nadol city in Rajasthan, temples were set on fire by the Turks and soldiers and the citizens were looted
 ghori dwaara nadol nagar kaa jo adhampatan hua, uske samachar prithviraj ko mili
 After that, in anger, he pledged to Ghori's door
 vah apane sainiko ke saath shastr lekar sajj ho gaye
 The young Prithviraj was of the opinion that, “the problem of Chalukya and Chauhan dynasty is Grihasamsya

 he rajan ! is samay krodh karnaa uchati nahin
 Fortunately, this opportunity has been received
 oont bhi bhakshan kar le, aise sarp par garuda kyon kopan karen? arthath anayas hi ye avasar praapt hua he, hamaare pratidwandvi paraspar yuddh karke apni shakti or bal ko ksheen kar lenge
 To substantiate his argument, Camas narrated the mythology of the demons and Tilottama, named Sundop and Sunda
 yatha sundope or sand naamak do asur bhai tilottama ke soundarya main aasakt paraspar yuddh karke nasht ho gayi the, tathaa inkaa bhi naash ho jaayegaa ye aashay tha
 This political argument of Camas has been condemned by all historians
 kyonki apane desh ke vishay main vichaar kar yuva prithviraj ne to chalukyon ke saath apni samasya ko gruhasamasya hi gina kar gujarat rajya kii sahaayta ke liye udyat hue the
 But under the complication of Camas, the confused young Prithviraj remained the observer of the attack on that province
 kuch itihasvide kehete hai ki, yadi us samay prithviraj ne gujarat rajya kii sahaayta kii hoti, arthath gujarat praant par jo akraman hua tha, uskaa pratikar kiya hota, to vartmanbharat kii seemaa or vartmanbharat kii sthiti bhinn hoti
 By establishing his suzerainty over the fort of Nadol and looting the entire Nadol city, the temples of Hathikundi place situated at Sewadi from Ghori Mirpur also reached the place called Jhodi

 When Ghori reached Kasahrad, only then the huge army of the state of Gujarat blocked its route

 Dharavarsha, the Paramara dynasty ruler of Abu Pradesh and Chandravati region and Naikidevi, the mother of Moolraj II, the abbot of the Chalukya dynasty, also participated in the war

 In the epic of Prithviraj Vijay, it is mentioned that, a messenger from the state of Gujarat had reached Sapadalaksh to give news of the victory of the state of Gujarat
 prithviraj ke sammukh usne turushk ke paraajay kaa sampoorn vivaran vistaar se bataaya
 Prithviraj properly respected the messenger and allowed him to leave
 tatpashchaat prithviraj ne apane mantri ko rashtraniti te vishay main bodh diya
 Prithviraj strongly advised Camas for the development of his national policy
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, 1191-1192 madhya main sapadalaksh jaisaa vishalsamrajya turk ke akraman se parajeet hua
 The failed diplomacy of Camas was behind him
 jaise mahmud gaznavi ne 150 varshon pehle gujarat rajya ke upar akraman karke gujarat rajya ko lutaa tha, vaise hi ghori kii ipsa thi
 But at the bottom of the Abu Mountains, Ghori became abject
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, ghori kii mahmud gaznavi ke saath tulana ayogy hi he
 Because the warrior intellect of Ghaznavi used to be very sharp during the sixties
 usase vipareet ghori ghori swabhaav se hi lampat, dhoort or kapati tha
 In all the battles he won, he took the path of treachery
 gujarat rajya main parajeet hue ghori ne 1182-83 varsh main lahore pradesh par akraman kar diya
 After that, the boundary of Ghori's kingdom reached near the end of Panjab Rajya, that is, near Sutlejanadi

 After that there was a war of Sutlej war, in which Ghori was deserted

 Minhaj Siraj has named the battlefield as Narayan
 tarikhe farishta granth main yudhakshetra kaa naam taraayan likhaa he
 Elsewhere, his statement is that Tarain ut Tarayan is still famous as Taravadi
 dow khalik ahamed nijaami or dow habibullah in dono ne farista-granth kaa samarthan kiya he
 Because both of them are of the opinion that, due to printer's defect, Narayan was replaced instead of Tarayan
 dow habibullah jis 'taraayan' kshetra kaa samarthan karte hai, vah thaneshwar se dakshindisha main 14 mile dur he
 But according to him, the place called Toravana was a Tarayan war zone
 wo toravana kshetra rajasthanrajya ke sirsamandal ke kalamvat naamak upmandal ke samipsth sthal he
 Dr
 Habibullah's bibliography is the treatise of General Cunningham
 'orcological survey off india' is main general kaningham ne likhaa he ki, tarin yuddh bhatinda se 27 mile dur sthit kisi sthaan main hua tha
 The place is known as Sadah: Toravana
 kaningham ne bhatinda or sirsa jalle ke madhya main sthit jis kshetra kii baat kii he, uskaa aadhaar 'yahia sarhindi' naamak pustak he
 The author named Yahiya Sirhindi has mentioned in the book titled 'date Mubarak Shahi' that the battle of Khittaye Surusuti took place in Tarainkshetra
 'tarikhe mubarakashahi' kaa sampaadan shamsulaummaa mohammad hidaayat hossain ne jan hastpraton ke aadhaar par kiya he, un main se kuch rajasthanrajya ke azamgarh zille main bhi hai
 In one of the Tino manuscripts of darul-musnafin-place of Azamgarh district, only "sarasuti" in place of "khitatye Sarsuti", "tarai" in place of "mentarine" is printed
 vaastavya main wo yuddh narin kshetra hi tha
 The section of Nasiri and tarikhe-mubaratshahi is also of the same opinion
 'yahia sarhindi' ke shuddh mudrit aitihaasik paath main miltaa he ki, saraswatinadi ke tir par 'tarai' main sthit narineshetra main hi yuddh hua tha
 There is no flaw anywhere in the text of the Persian language, but seeing the English translation or ignorance, this defect has been entered
 is prakaar yudhsthal ke vishay main vivaad samudbhoot hua
 Discussion by historians concludes that Prithviraj's war with Ghori took place in Narayankshetra itself
 iskaaka drudhtya anek itihasvid samarthan karte hai
 Prof
 Es Hodiwala is also included in them
 atah bhugolic or aitihasikatathyon se yudhakshetra kaa naam narin hi tha
 Because Taravadi is the nearest place to Narayankshetra, it is also called narayan-taravadi war
 sirsa jile main sthit torwanaa-sthal narayan yudhakshetra ke rup main gyaan bhraamak sandarbhon kaa parinaam tha
 Narayankshetra is 135 km from Delhi, Narayankshetra is 21 km from Thaneshwar
 ye 'tarikhe farista' pustak main bhi ullikhit hua he
 The Tornavana site mentioned by Cunningham is 342 km from Delhi, so according to the geographical details, General Cunningham's information also proves to be arithmetic
 1175 se 1191 tak ghori dwaara bharat ke sameepavarti pradeshon main or bhartiyapradesho main c bahut akraman kiye
 The first war of Narayan took place in the year 1190
 us yuddh main ghori kii paraajay hui tathaa prithviraj ne ghori ko bindi bhi banaaya tha
 For the first time in 1190 year, Ghori systematically attacked the Sapdalaksha Empire
 satluj nadi ko langhakar sapadalakshasamrajya ke sarhind-sthal par ghori ne akraman kiya
 Ghori was symbolized by the soldiers of the fort of Sirhind, but Ghori established success establishing the dominion over the fort
 sarhind ke durg par aadhipaty prasthaapit kar ghori jiyauddin tolki naamake apane sevak ko shashan dakar gazani pradesh waapas chalaa gaya 
 Ziauddin Tolki was the son of Minhaj's uncle, the author of a book called 'tabkate Nasiri'
 apane bhai ke vishay main minhaj ne likhaa he ki, durg ke rakshan ke liye ghori ne 12,000 ashwarohi sainikon ko niyukt kiya tha
 In the book titled 'tarikhe Farishta', the number of horsemen is 1040
 prithviraj ne jab sarhind ke durg par akraman ke samachar paae, tab vah apane samanton ke saath sarhind pradesh kii ore batch gayi
 Prithviraj's army consisted of 2,00,000 Ashwarohi and 3,000 elephants
 farista-pustak main ullikhit he ki, prithviraj ne sarhind pradesh kii ore vishalsena ke saath yatram armbh kar di he ye jab ghori ko gyaat hua, tab usne bhi vishaal sanybal ko saath lekar sarhind pradesh kii ore yatra armbh kar di
 Sadya: The place which is famous by the name 'taravadi' was then Narayan, a fierce battle took place between the two armies in that area
 narin ke yuddh kii vyuharachna kaa varnan 'farista' naamak pustak main praapt hota he
 It is mentioned that when Ghori saw the vast army of Rajputs, Ghori also divided the army into three parts to disguise his army
 rajputon kii sena ko dekhakar ghori ke man main vishaad samudbhoot ho gaya
 Fearing defeat, he quickly divided his army into three parts as the Rajput army had three parts
 madhyabhaag kii sena kaa netritv ghori ne kiya tha
 In the army of Prithviraj, divided into three parts, the Gajsena of the middle division was ready to attack
 prithviraj kii sena main akraman kaa mukhyadayitv ashwarohi sena kaa tha
 The cavalry army consisted of swordsmen and shuldhari soldiers divided into three divisions
 padaati or gajasena ke madhya main sanchaalak ke rup main bhattarkaparmeshwar tha
 He was leading the battle of Arudh Bharateshwar Prithviraj on his beloved
 jab sena apane shatruon ke pratikar karne ke liye teen bhaag main vibhakt hoti thi, tab viruddh sena ke upar bheeshan akraman kaa daayitv vam bhaag or dakshin bhaag kaa hota tha
 As part of the Samratantra, the general commander makes AC architecture
 donon senaayen ek duusare kii ore dodne lagi
 First the cavalry army of Prithviraj's back attacked Ghori's left and south
 ghori ke sainik us ghaatak akraman ko sahane main shakt nahin the
 Therefore, to protect the lives, they started migrating towards the middle of the army
 is prakaar turksena kaa vyuh dhwast ho gaya
 All Ghori's divisions were mixed
 us vyuh ke dhwast hone se anek yavansainik maare gayi
 Due to the invasion of Rajputs, the legendary soldiers of Turkasena also abandoned the battlefield and fled
 yuddh ke armbh pashchaat ghori dehalipradesh ke samant govind kii ore gaya
 Seeing Ghori coming towards him, Govind also went ahead to fight with him
 tatpashchaat un donon main yuddh hua
 Ghori struck Govind with his prick
 vah shul govind ke mukh main pravisht ho gaya
 Govind's teeth also fell from the shulprabhar
 shul govind ke mukh se pravisht ho kar kanth tak antar chalaa gaya
 After that Govind also attacked
 govind ne apane shul ke prahaar se ghori kii bhujaa par aghat kiya
 That shock was very powerful
 bhaybheet ghori apane ashv kii disha ko parivartit kar yudhakshetra se bhaag gaya
 But the hurt Ghori fell to the ground
 rajput sainiko dwaara ghori ko bandi bana liya gaya
 In this way, Prithviraj established complete suzerainty over the Turk soldiers
 minhaj ke pustak main ullekh he ki, prithviraj ne ghori ko bandi bana liya
 After this, Prithviraj freed Ghori along with the soldiers of Toorak after Ghori apologized
 prithviraj kii vijay ke anantar ghori kii sena par koi bhi hatyachaar nahin kiya gaya tha
 Prithviraj sent all the soldiers towards the safe balance
 prithviraj kii is udaartaa kaa bhartiya rashtravaadi itihaaskaaro devara katu aalochana kii gai he
 According to the historians, the main reason for the defeat of Prithviraj in the second war of Narayan was the liberation of Ghori
 itihasvid dow bindhyanath chouhan kehete hai ki, bhartiyasanskruti main sharnaarthi kaa vadh nishiddh he
 The assassination of the defeated army soldiers was unfair to the Indian war tradition
 kyonki manusmriti main kaha he ki – Neither the incidents nor the parables 7
93 Manusmriti॥ arthath jinke shastr nasht ho gayi hai, jo shok se vidagdh ho rahe hai, jo gabhirathya aahat hai, jo bhaybheet hai, jo yuddh se palayan kar rahe hai, unka vadh anuchit he
 After the defeat of Ghori in the first Narayan war, Ghori was freed by the order of Prithviraj
 vahaan uske sainik uski pratiksha kar rahe the
 In Lahore region, Ghori stayed for two months
 kyonki yuddh main aahat ghori kii sharirak vrin ke liye oshadhi aavashyak thi
 Lahore fort was also renovated by Do Mas Ghori
 tatpashchaat vah apni sena ke saath gazani pradesh chalaa gaya
 According to Isami's statement, after reaching Ghazni region, Ghori gave death to a king named Ghaznavi-dynasty, Khushro Malik and his son
 ghori ne gazani pradesh pahuch kar narin ke pratham yuddh main jo sainik rankshetra se palaayan kar gayi the, unako bhi dand diya
 It is mentioned in the book 'farishta' that when Ghori reached Ghazni region, he did not torture Afghan territorial soldiers, but punished them by insulting Ghori-clan, Khorasani-clan and Khalji-clan soldiers
 ghori ne un sainikon ke mukh main apakv yav se bhare syut bandhavakar nagar unako ghumaya
 Ghori's order was that soldiers who do not eat unruly yachts from the bed should be separated from their bodies
 narin yuddh ke anantar ghori kii manahosthiti avsaad, klesh or aatmaglani se yukt thi
 It is mentioned in the texts such as the strata Nasiri and Tarikhe Farishta, that Ghori had become so sad that he had also abandoned food and water
 din or raatri vah apane paraajay ke dukh kii agni main jalataa rahata tha
 He did not even sleep with his wife
 tatpashchaat uski mata kii prerana se ghori punah yuddh ke liye sajj ho gaya
 
 ek baar ghori abak ke saath baith kar narinyuddh main hue paraajay kii samiksha kar rahaa tha
 Then Aibak said to Ghori, our horses are good, but they used to get scared after seeing the faces of Indian elephants
 kyonki pehle kabhi bhi unka bhartiya hathion ke saath yuddh kaa anubhav nahin tha
 So they were scared near Indian arms
 yahi mukhya kaaran he, jis se ham bhartiya sena ke sammukh parajeet hue
 Knowing the reason for his defeat, how should Ghori do horse training before the advance war? The Aibak also asked for its solution
 vah bolaa, gili mitti se or kashtha se hathion kaa nirmaan karaao
 Decorate those arms as Indian elephants are adorned
 tatpashchaat un hathion ke chaaro ore ashwarohi dwaara yuddh kii sthiti kaa nirmaan karvaa kar ashwon ko nirbhay banaao
 In this way, even in front of Indian elephants in war time, the horse will be able to symbolize them fearlessly
 ghori ke paraamarsh ke anusaar abak ne ashv prashikshan karavaaya
 He himself started devising war related policies
 usne sachal-sainik-dal kii rachana kar lee
 The main task of that mobile party was that in case of any array of soldiers weakened during the war, this team could go from one party to an upper team in a war zone
 is prakaar yuddh kshetra main yadi kisi dal kaa samarthy durbal ho jaataa he, tarhi ye dal us apper dal kii sahaayta karke yuddh kshetra main apane bal ko santulit kar saktaa he
 Soldiers mounted on horse should also be able to wield arrows, so AIB was trained by its soldiers
 abak kii ranneeti kaa varnan farsi-bhashaa ke aitihaasik sahitya main to praapt nahin hota, parantu prasiddh yuddh vigyaani aar e smile ke pustak main ullekh miltaa he
 a description of an armor is also found in the book Futuhussalatin written by Isami
 us kavach kaa naam 'karvaa' tha
 That armor was made from oxen
 us kavach ke donon ore kapaas yaa oon sthapit kiya jaataa tha
 The Indian Army should attack the troop of Turk Army every now and then, so that those soldiers will not get hurt
 That was the purpose of making that armor
 is prakaar ghori ne aibak ke saath milakar praharatmak nit or rakshaatmak niti kii rachana kar lee
 Historians believe that Ghori's army consisted of various commanders of the Afghan army, Ottoman army, Tajik army and Tulak army
 phutuhussalatin naamak pustak main kuch senapatiyon ke naam milte hai
 As- 1
 kharbak – iskaa daanav jaisaa sharir tha
 He was the commander of the advance party
 2

 3
 Mukalba - was a warrior of the Central Army
 4
 kharmel – kendriya sena kaa yoddha tha
 5
 Qutbuddin Aibak - was the general manager of the entire army
 yudhakshetra main ye sarvada ghori ke sameep hi bana rahata tha
 6
 Tajuddin Yalduz - was the commander of a party
 7
 nasiruddin kubacha – haraval-dal kaa netritv ye kar rahaa tha
 8
 Muhammad bin Mahmud - He was the uncle of Bakhtiyar Khalji
 yah patibaddh or kushal senanayake tha
 All these commanders were skilled in operating the army in the Rann region
 ghori kii sena ko chhod kar in senapatiyon ki apni vyaktigat sena bhi thi
 Shortly before Ghori's visit to India, according to Minhaj's statement, 12,000 cavalry of Tulak-dynasties were included in his army with Tulki's insistence
 1191 tame varshe ghori ityeshah bhaaratan prati yatram aarbhat 
 Ghori reached Lahore region via Peshawar region and Multan region
 ghori ne lahore ke durg main rahakar prithviraj ke viruddh shadyantra bhi armbh kar diya
 On the one hand he was busy with his military arrangements, military training and dispatching of intelligence, on the other hand he sent his messenger to Ajayameru fort
 yadhyapi vah jaanata tha ki, prithviraj uske patr kaa kya pratyuttar denge, tathaapi usne ajayameru ke durg main doot ko bheja
 Because he only wanted to spend time
 uske peeche uskaa uddesh tha ki, uski sena yuddh ke liye sajj ho or sahyogi nishtha kaa punah pareekshan ho sake
 Ghori's messenger appeared before Prithviraj
 ghori dwaara pradutt patr usne padhaa
 It was mentioned in that letter, Prithviraj! Wear the jewels of independence in your ears and be present in my palace, and you renounce Islam
 anya farsi lekhakon ne bhi ukt kathan kaa samarthan kiya he
 The angel meets that, Ghori reached Lahore region with his army, then Kawamulmulk Rukunuddin Hamza sent Ajayemaru Durg to deliver his message
 us main "raja islam-dharm kaa angikara karen" ye sandesh likhaa hua tha
 It is mentioned in the book named Farishta that Prithviraj heard the message from the mouth of the messenger, then he used abusive language for Islam
 prithviraj ne ismaal-dharm ke anuyaayi raajaaon ko bhi apshabd kahe the
 Then Kavamulmulk was sent back
 1990 varsh main ghori ko parajeet kar prithviraj kaa samrajya bharat kii pramukh shakti ke rup main gina jane laga tha
 Due to the power of Prithviraj, the heart of the opponents started to suffer schizophrenia
 jo raja prithviraj se parajeet hue the, ve avasar praapt kar prithviraj ke upar aghat karne ko tatpar the
 King of Jammu region Vijaydev became the chief assistant of Ghori
 prabandhsangrah or prithviraj raso kavy main jammupati ke ghori kii sahaayta ke ullekh praapt hote hai
 Nayachandra Suri has written in his book that the king of Jammuupradesh sent his son Narasimhadeva with his army to Narayankshetra
 hegg naamak itihasvid ne apane pustak main ullekh kiya he ki, naranay ke dwitiya yuddh main bharat kaa sabhi raja upasthit the, parantu raashtra swatantrata kii raksha te liye bhi kannauj pradesh ke raja jayachand ne apane jamata prithviraj kii sahaayta nahin kii
 He did not fight even in the first war of Narayan
 narin ke dwitiyayuddh main prithviraj kii paraajay ke kaaran hi bharat main muslimsatta kii sthiti drudh ho gai, kyonki jayachand rashtrashatruon ke saath sandhi kar baitha
 According to James Todd, King Jayachand of Kannauj region and the King of Patan region invited Muhammad Ghori for the complete destruction of Prithviraj
 jejakabhuktipradesh ke raja chandel bhi ghori kaa sahyogi tha
 The Shalivahanbhati clan of Jaisalmer region was consuming the Rajsukh only with the blessings of Ghori
 yuddh main hemelatobhaati-vansh to ghori kii sena kaa mahattavapurn uttardaayitv vahan kar rahe the
 Ghori's financial support, military help and information were helped by the regent king of the Sapadalakshtra kingdom
 yada ghori apane sainya ke saath sapadalakshasamrajya kii seemaa ke sameep pahunchaa, tabasapadalaksh-samrajya ke chaaron ore sthit rajyon ne sapadalakshasamrajya kii seemaa par utpaat aarabh kar diya
 His aim was that, the army of the warring Prithviraj would be divided from all sides
 dwitiya narin yuddh ke samay unki yojana ke anusaar hi hua
 Prithviraj's army was waging war in various areas of the kingdom of Sapadalaksha
 sapadalakshasamrajya kaa pradhansenapati narinyuddh ke samay un yudho main hi rat tha
 Another commander of Prithviraj named Udayaraja was also at war elsewhere
 ghori ko pratham narinyuddh main parajeet kar prithviraj uttarabhartiya ke kshetro main charchaa kaa vishay bane gayi the
 Prithviraj's former enemies were waiting for his downfall
 atah yada ghori ne prithviraj ke saath yuddh kiya, tabasamipsth rajyone prithviraj ke samrajya par akraman kar diya
 Those states were mainly Kannauj, Kalinjar, Anhilpatan states on the east-south border of Sapradalakshtra kingdom

 In the year 1182-83, those two states were also occupied by Prithviraj
 dusri ore sanyogita haran se cruddh jayachand kisi bhi prakaar prithviraj kaa vinaash dekhnaa chahta tha
 The incident of coincidence haran took place only during the first war of Narayan
 jin itihasvidon ne tatkaaleen paristhition kaa adhyayan kiya, unka kathan he ki, prithviraj yada digvijay abhiyaan main the, tab unhone anek raajaaon ke manbhang kiye
 But Prithviraj gave life to everyone
 is prakaar digvijay abhiyaan se prithvirajki sena main yaa seemaa main koi vruddhi nahin hui thi, api tu unke shatruon kii sankhya main pratidin vrudghi ho rahi thi
 Defeating enemies and giving them life became the main reason for the defeat of Prithviraj
 sanyogitaaharan ke anantar prithviraj adhik samay tak navvivaahit sanyogita ke saath hi samay vyateet karne lage
 This led to the emergence of a vicious cycle in Ajayameru Prasad
 prithviraj kii padmavati naamak raji ke man main sanyogita ke prati dwesh samudbhoot ho gaya
 In Ajaymeru Prasad, there were frequent squabbles between them
 prithviraj dwaara upekshit padmavati ne vaseekaran prayog se prithviraj ke upar aadhipaty kaa praytn kiya
 He killed a pregnant cow due to tantric method
 uske pashchaat us gaay ke prajnan ang lekar apni tantrikavidhi ko armbh kiya
 After proving the Tantrikavidhi, Prithviraj was subjugated to Padmavati
 prithviraj jab padmavati ke tantrapash main baddh the, tabhi prasaad main ek anya avanchhneeya ghatana ho gai
 In the absence of Prithviraj, the mahamandaleshwar named Kaimas of Sapadalakasamrajya used to see the overall rule
 vah kaimaas karnati naamak daasi ke saath avaidh sambandh main bandh chukaa tha
 As time passed, both of them used to conduct their work in the Raj Bhavan in the darkness of the night
 ek baar raatri main padmavati ne prasaad ke ek prakoshth main kaimaas ko us daasi ke saath abhadrasthiti main dekh liya
 Padmavati smuggled Prithviraj to the work of Camas
 prithviraj cho padmavati ke tantrapash main baddh he the, atah vibhram sthiti main prithviraj uchitanirnay karne main asamarth the
 After that, when Kaimas was engaged with the maid at night, Prithviraj reached there and killed Kaimas there
 kaimaas ke daasi ke saath paapasmbandh the ye to ajayameru prasaad kaa durbhaagya hi tha
 But the reason for the slaying of the Camas is mentioned in the ancient management
 puratanprabandhsangrah anusaar prithviraj ke rajasav adhikari pratapsingh garjani pradesh main kar sweekaar ne ke liye jaataa tha
 Once, Pratap Singh donated one Lakshpan to the 'masjid' in Garjani region
 yada kaimaas ne raja ko kaha, "he dev ! gazani pradesh se kar ke rup main jo dhan ham pate hai, usase hamaare rajkaarya hote hai
 But revenue officer Pratapsingh wastes that money in such works "
 raja ne jab kaimaas ke aarope vishay main pratapsingh ko puchha, tab vah bolaa, "dev ! aapke upar pratikulgrah prabhaav ko jaanakar hi maine us dhan kaa vyay kiya tha
 Because the astrologer told me about the trouble in your life "
 anukshan hi pratapsingh ne shaniah prithviraj ke kaanon main kaimaas ke viruddh chugali kar di
 He said, God! Minister Camas keeps calling Turks and Gentiles here again and again
 pratapsingh ke vachan sunakar cruddh prithviraj ne kaimaas kaa vadh kar diya
 In the above story, we cannot test the truth and untruth, but the available evidence is clarifying the two topics
 ek to ghori ke guptchar tantra ke sampark main ajayameru shashan ke anek sadsy the, un main se pratapsih pramukh tha
 The slaughter of the Second Camas is also confirmed
 parantu deshadroh vaa kamprasang main ye gyaat nahin hota
 According to a book titled Futuhussalatin, news of the slaying of Camas in the Rajprasad of Ajayameru region was reported by Ghori detectives to Ghazni region
 dwitiya narin yuddh kii tithi ke vishay main anek tark hai
 Different dates are found in different books

 At that time, the month of Shravan was half past and there was consternation

 Because many Indian texts and other Persian texts also present other dates

 The war started on the twenty-ninth day of January month of 1190, after which the war was completed on the seventeen day of January month of 1191
 arthath 1190 varsh ke janvari maas kii untiis dinank ke purv kisi bhi samay ghori ne bharat kii ore yatra armbh kar di thi
 Ghori won the Narayan war before seventeen days of January month of 1191
 farsi granth anusaar tab 'ramajaan' naamak yavanmaas armbh hone vaala tha
 If it is 'ramadan' month on the seventeenth day of January month of 1191 year, then only the date mentioned in the Persian scripture is valid
 hi
 san ke yavanpanchang kaa armbh 1 muharram se hota he
 In this way, 588 H
I
 was started on the 18th of January month of 1192 year
 us din shaniwasar tha
 According to 'ramadan' month is the tenth month according to Yavanpanchang, 'ramadan' month was started on the tenth day of September month of 1192 years
 nijaami kaa kathan he ki, narin kaa yuddh 'ramajaan'-maas se purv hi purna ho chukaa tha
 Therefore, from the seventeenth day of January-month of 1192 year, the war of Narayan was completed till the tenth day of September-month of 1192 year
 farsigranthon main yuddh kaa kaal to jaan padataa, parantu narin ke dwitiyayuddh kii nishchit tithi nahin praapt hoti
 Jainacharya Jinprabhusuri was a contemporary of King Muhammad Tughlaq of Dehli
 un donon ke samaankaleenta ke anek pramaan uplabdh hai
 He is the creator of a book called Jainacharya Kanyanayaniyamahaveerpratimakalpa
 itihasvidon kaa mat he ki, vah pustak khartargachhpattavali se bhi adhik upyogi he
 In the twelfth era of the Kanyanayaniyamahavirpratimakalpa, mention is received that in 1248 Vikram Samvatsar, Ghori was killed by Ghori in the place of Chauhanakuladivakara Sriputhviraj, then the Turks came to power in Ajmeru Prasad
 atah ajayameru ke mantri mahashreshtiramdev ne soochna prasaarit kar di ki, "yavan jainstygh kii murtion kaa naash kare, uske purv hi sabhi jainacharya murtion ko bhoomi main gupt guha banaakar surakshit kar len"
 In 1248 Vikram Samvatsar, a razor inscription was produced
 ustaraan pradesh se anek jeern jainamandir or virasmarak mili thi
 Many inscriptions were found in Veerasmarco
 un shilaalekh main ullekh he ki, 1248 vikram sanvatsar ke jyaistha kii krishnashashthee somvaasar ko rana motishwara ke marannimitt gohilavansheey raji naamak raji ne satidharm kaa paalan kiya tha
 Rana Motishwara's death anniversary was also called his son named Vijayaraja
 This is mentioned in other inscriptions
 motishwara or vijayraj ke saath saath anek hutatmaon ke naam shilalekho main uttankich kiye gayi milte hai
 According to the said date, the inscription was produced on the fourth day of May-month of 1192 years
 atah us dinank se purv hi kisi yuddh main un veeron kii mrityu hui thi ye siddh hota he
 Another inscription has also been found from a place called Goth Mangalod
 vah shilaalekh bhi ukt tithi ko hi uttankit kiya gaya tha
 According to that inscription many rajnis became sati after Jaisingh's heroism
 bajalu naamak sthal se ke sameep main) praapt 1249 vikram sanvatsar ke baishakhmas ke shuklachaturdashi ko somvaasar ke din kisi parmarpramukh ke hutatma ho jane se uski rajniyaan sati hui thi
 One can reconcile the dates on the basis of various perspectives and other inscriptions
 ukt pramaanon se siddh hota he ki, 1192 varsh ke may-maas kii chauthi dinank se purv ghori ne narin yuddh main vijay paa lee thi
 He then took possession of Ajayameru
 farsigranthon, bhartiyagranthon or bharatiyashilalekhon ke avlamban se nishchit hota he ki, yuddh kaa samgr ghatnakram 1192 varsh ke farvari-maas kii aththaravin dinank se 1192 varsh ke april-maas kii sattaaise dinank tak hua tha
 The study of Rajavali written in 1685 Vikram Samvatsar has also proved to be important for knowing the actual date of the war of Narayan
 sarvapratham baar 1953 varsh main jainsaahityacharya agarchand nahata ne us rajavali ko prakashit kiya tha
 In 1953, the book was published in Dr
 Dashrath Sharma's book titled 'kalevar of Unknown Mother Indraprastha Prabandha'
 vanshavali main likhaa he ki, 1249 vikram sanvatsar ke chaitramas kii krishnadvithiya tithi ko prithviraj ke sahabandhu visalpal ke putr divakar ko bandi banaakar tejpal ne dehali par aadhipaty sthapit kar liya
 1249 On the brightest date of Chaitramas of Vikram Samvatsar, Ghori defeated Tejpal and took over Delhi
 ukt pramaanon se siddhya hota he ki, 17 march dinank se purv dehali kaa patan nahin hua tha or 17 march dinank se purv prithviraj hutatma hue the
 Evidence of Ghori's military activity within the Narayan war is also available
 tajul masir naamak pustak main hasan nijaami ne ullikhit kiya he ki, narinyuddh ke pashchaat ghori sarvapratham ajayameru -prasaad pahunchaa, tatpashchaat usne dehali ko jita
 Hasan Nizami's statement also supports a book called 'lubb Tawarikhe Hind'
 rajavali ke anusaar 1249 vikram sanvatsar ke chaitramas kii krishnadvithiya tith ko tejpal narinyuddh se palaayan kar dehali bhaag gaya tha
 According to Anglapanchang, 1192 was the third date of the month of March-year
 narin ke yuddh tritiy prahar main purna ho chukaa tha
 Historians are of the opinion that Prithviraj may have been made a point by Turksaniko, probably at three o'clock or four o'clock
 tejpal usee samay yudhakshetra se palaayan kar dehali chalaa gaya hoga
 Eighty km from the battlefield of Tejpal Narayan to Dehli
 kii drutatar gati se gaya ho, tab bhi uski yatra do din main samaapt hui hogi
 In this way, the battle of Narayan must have been completed on the first day of March-month of 1192 year on Ravivasar
 bhartiyapanchang ke anusaar us din holikaa parv tha
 The battlefield of Narayan was created with the blood of Hindus on the full moon date of falgun-mass of 1249 Vikram Samvatsar
 sriharihar nivas dwivedi ke matanusaar narinyuddh ke pashchaat kii sambhavit tithi nimna ho sakati hai
 • March 1 - The end of the Narayan war • 5 march – ghori dwaara prithviraj ko ajayameru le janaa
 • March 11 - Prithviraj's demise
 • 13 march – govind ne ajayameru kaa samrajya samarpit kar diya
 • 17 March - Fall of Silli prithviraj ne 1190 varsh main ghori ko narineshetra main parajeet kiya tha
 Thereafter, Ghori increased his military power during the one-year exercise
 duusari ore prithviraj ek varsh tak bhartiya raajnneeti kshetra main vyast rahe
 He also fought many wars that year
 1190 varsh main bharat kii jo rajnatik prishthbhumi khee, vah prishthbhumi ek varsh main vipareet ho chuki thi
 The undercurrents of Rajputs had become huge
 uttarabhartiya raja satat paraspar yudhya karne main vyast the
 Ghori took advantage of the mutual struggle between the Rajput kings and Prithviraj was again attacked
 narin ke yudhakshetra main ghori ko "kisi bhi prakaaran vijay praapt karne ke liye sajj tha"
 On the other hand, Prithviraj did not have any military prowess
 ghori jaanata tha ki, prithviraj kaa sainysamarthy kitna he or prithviraj kii yuddh ke liye sajjataa nahin he
 a description of Prithviraj's war related inefficiency is received by Hammirmahakaavya
 hammirmahakavy main ullikhit kiya gaya he ki, prithviraj ke senapati udayraj apni sena ke yuddh kshetra main vilamb se pahunche
 Prithviraj's prince could not even participate in the Narayan war
 kyonki vah anya yuddh main rat tha
 Such descriptions are also found in the 17 verses of the book called Virudhvidhyavidhyavansha
 prithviraj ke liye yuddh main vilamb ho ye atyaavashyak tha, parantu ghori prithviraj kii durbalata kaa laabh lekar yuddh karne ko tatpar ho gaya
 Ghori and his officers were adorned for the war by speculating a lot about the war plan
 ve kab ?, kahan ? or kaise ? prithviraj kii sena par akraman karenge iskaa sab chintan unke dwaara ho chukaa tha narineshetra main ghori ke paas jo sena thi, vah chaar vibhaagon main vibhakt thi
 Soldiers of that army were adorned with unarmed weapons and unarmed horses
 chora vibhaagon main vibhakt vah sena chaaron dishaao main bhartiya sena ke upar akraman karne ke liye sajj thi
 In addition to the army which was divided into four divisions, a team of 10,000 soldiers was composed by Ghori
 wein 10,000 sainik ashv par arurh hote hue bhi baan chalaane main samarth the
 He was ordered by Ghori to fight against enemies from left, south, front and back
 aage ghori dwaara aadesh diya gaya tha ki, yada bhartiya sena ke ashwarohi, padaati or hathi akraman ke liye aage aayen, tabawein peeche jaakar apane or shatru ke madhya ek ashv daud sake utana antar rakkhen
 This policy of Ghori was meant to create confusion among the Bharti soldiers
 ukt niti se yadi turksainik yudhakshetra main aacharan karte hai, tarhi bhartiya sainikon main bhram hota he ki, turksena te sabhi sainik yudhakshetra main hai
 Different projects of Ghori's strategy are found in different books
 yatha yahiya sarhindi naamak pustak main ullekh he ki, yada hindooon ke hathi or ashv arohinh turksena ke kisi dalsy ke upar akraman karte, tarhi anya dal teenon disha se akraman karte the
 In the book of Isami, it is also mentioned, that Ghori's contemplation of the first war of Narayan was that Turkic horses were afraid in the presence of Indian celebrities, so in the second war we have to mainly attack the elephant
 iske liye ghori dwaara abak ke saath milakar gazani pradesh main ashv bhi prashikshit kiye gayi the
 With the said military plan, Ghori spent the entire night in military decorations
 duusari ore prithviraj kii sena sampoorn raatri gahan nidra ke adheen thi
 At Brahmamuhurta, Ghori's army was ready to attack Prithviraj's camp from all around
 jis samay prithviraj ke sainik nidradhin the, usee samay ghori ne akraman kar diya
 Prithviraj himself was engrossed in sleep at the beginning of the war
 kuch sainik dainik kaaryon main vyast the
 In the year 998, as in the battle of lamgan, it was also in the war of Narayan
 supt rajput sena ke upari kavachadhari, sashastrasainik or ashwarohi kaa akraman ho gaya
 More than Chalice Sahasra Turksmen invaded Prithviraj's army accidentally
 jab tak paryantan sabhi sajj hote, tab tak to pralay sadrush sthiti ho gai thi
 Many Rajput soldiers had died in the battlefield itself
 prithviraj kaa adhik sanybal us akraman main hi vinasht ho chaka tha
 Historians believe that Narayan's Second War was not an actual war, but an accident
 us yuddh main na to hathion yaa ashwon kaa yuddh main upyog hua, na to koi rajputsainik yuddh kar paaya
 Surprised, all the mortals went to Yamlok, suffering from anguish
 adhiktam sainik snaan bhi nahin kar paye, kuch ashv ke sameep bhi nahin pahunch sake, yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke pehle hi anek rajput sainikon kii hatya ho gai
 In that attack, the invaders were in good shape, because they had determined the time and place of the attack
 ghori kii kendriya sena kaa netritv vah swayan kar rahaa tha
 On his left was a commander named Ilah and in the south was a commander named Mukalba
 agrim dal kaa netritv kharbak naamak yoddha kar rahaa tha
 a warrior named Kharmel was employed with his army at the back of Ghori
 qutubuddin abak sabhi vibhaagon kaa netritv kar rahaa tha
 He always lived near Ghori
 us samay ghori kii sena main 1,03,000 ashwarohi the
 Each soldier of Ghori's army was equipped with armor called 'jihar'
 ghori kii arakshit sena main 12,000 akramak yoddha the
 They were also adorned with armor called 'jihar', crown of loh and with assi, bow and shul
 turk sainiko ke aakasmik akraman se prithviraj kii sena chhin-vicchhinn ho gai
 No one was able to lead the soldiers
 us samay dehali ke govind raay naamak pradhan senapati ne rajputon kii sena kaa netritv kiya
 He gathered his army and started a war against the Ottoman army
 govind raay yada yuddh kaa netritv kar rahaa tha, takinya senadhyaksh bhi usase judane lage
 Pithora was led by the Central Army
 govindaray ke vam bhaag kii sena ke adhyaksh padamsha rawal or dakshin bhaag kii sena ke adhyaksh bhuvanakamall naamak senapati nijasena ke sainikon kaa netritv kar rahe the
 Govand Rai along with the elephantine attacked the advance team of Khabarak
 khabarak ne kisi prakaar apni raksha kii
 He then ordered his soldiers to "attack only the elephants with their arrows"
 khabarak ke aadesh anusaar turksainikon ne hathion aup mahavaton par akraman kar diya
 54 Chauvan elephants of the elephant army were hurt by the arrows of the Ottoman soldiers
 jis se bhartiya sena ke hathi itastatah hoge
 After this, according to the description of Isami, Hindusena turned towards defeat
 farista main ullikhit he ki, ghori ke aadesh anusaar uski sena chaar vibhaagon main vibhakt thi
 Ghori's order was that all the divisions should not fight with the Hindusena, but to wage war
 "yada hindooon kii hastisena yavansena par vijayonmukhi ho, tabasainik yudhakshetra se palaayan kar jaaen
 After that, the Rajput soldiers will come after you, reach the proper place away from the battle field and attack the Yavan Sainik Hindusena
 kisi bhi prakaar sabhi hindoosainikon kaa naash karnaa he" ye bhi ghori kaa aadesh tha
 According to the orders of Yavasena Ghori, he started fighting with Brahmamuhut till midnight, but the possibility of defeat of Hindusena was not visible
 madhyahn main ghori ne yada anubhav kiya ki, hindoosena ke saath yuddh main abhi bhi vijay kii sthiti nahin he, tabausane arakshit sena ko akraman kaa aadesh diya
 12,000 reserved armymen attacked Hindusena by accidental manner
 vah akraman atibhayankar tha
 Many Hindus were killed in that attack
 yuddh se purv sapadalaksh samrajya ke upar chaaron or se akraman karke simavarti rajyon kaa deshadroh ke shadyantra ke parinaam swaroop prithviraj kii sena anek vibhaago main vibhakt ho gai thi
 Thereafter, on the day of the battle, many Hindus were killed by the invasion of Prithviraj's war Shibir by Ghori's army in Brahmamuhurta
 na keval bharat ke anek rajpariwaar prithviraj ke viruddh shadyantra kar chuke the, api tu prithviraj kii sena ke anek padaadhikari bhi yavan sena ke shadyantra main sammilit ho chuke the
 Prithviraj was also imprisoned due to the betrayal of the near by Prithviraj
 ukt kathan kaa samarthan hasan nijaami, isami, nayachandsuri ityadi lekhak bhi karte hai
 The details of the war are found in detail in his books
 yada yuddh paraakaashtha par tha or govind raay apane hathisena ke prabhaav se turksena ke upar vijayonmukh tha, tabaprithviraj hindoosena ke or ghori yavansena ke kendriya vibhaag kaa netritv kar rahe the
 At the same time, Kharmel ordered his archery soldiers to "attack the arms of Hindusena"
 tatpashchaat yavan sainikon ne purnabal se hindoosena ke hathion par akraman kar diya
 Afraid of Banavarsha elephants started fleeing immediately
 us updrav main kharmel ke aadesh se yavansainikon dwaara daudte hue hathion ke peeche dundubhi aadi se gambheer dhwani utpann kii gai
 There were two incidents in the state of disarray in Hindusena
 sab se pratham to jis hathi par arurh hokar prithviraj yudhya kar rahe the, vah hathi baanon se aahat hokar aniyantrit ho gaya
 So Prithviraj came down from the hurt elephant and ordered his confidant to bring the horse
 dwitiya hua ye ki, ghori ne hindoosena main astavyastata kii sthiti ko dekhakar vambhag or dakshinbhaag se akraman karne ke liye apane sainikon ko aadesh diya or 12,000 arakshit sainikon ko bhi akraman kaa aadesh de diya vah swayan kendriya sena ke saath aage aa gaya
 The horse on which Prithviraj sowed ascension after getting down from the hurt elephant was the horse of the ashwa theater
 ghori ke saath deshadrohion kaa shadyantra yudhakshetra main bahudhaa safal hua
 When Prithviraj mounted on the horse, Ghori's soldiers started playing Bheri the second moment
 bheri kaa sangit sunakar prithviraj kaa ashv nrity karne laga
 Prithviraj knows what has happened after seeing the condition of the horse
 What else will happen ?
 ve sheeghra hi us ashv se utar gayi or hindu padaation ke saath milakar yuddh karne lage
 At the same time, a Turksician from behind hit the cervix of Prithviraj
 tatpashchaat turksainikon ne milakar prithviraj ke upar akraman karke prithviraj ko bandi bana liya 
 On the first day of March-11 of the year 1192, the Hindus were weary of casual attacks, Bubuksha, Pipasa and conspiracies were defeated in the war
 us din 36 rajwanshon ke asankhya virasainik ne apni mathrubhumi kii raksha ke liye apane pranahuti de di
 Many children were orphans and many women became widows
 sapadalaksh samrajya ke patan se kannauj pradesh ke raja jayachand ne ghrit ke deepak jalaakar utsav manaaya
 After conquering Narayan's war, Ghori reached ajayemaru-prasad with Prithviraj
 nagar main pravesh ke anukshan hi turksainikon ne nagar main utpaat armbh kar diya
 Temples, idols and schools were looted and destroyed
 nagar janon kaa dhan or amoolyavastuon kaa bal purvak apharan yavansainik dwaara kiya gaya
 They start raping Hindu women, women and widows
 nagar main mahila, balak, vruddh or purushon ke aartnaad gunjan rahe the 
 There is an organization called 'sardool Research Institute' in Bikaner
 us sanstha main prithviraj raso kavy kii pracheenatam hastprat praapt hoti hai
 There is a famous class in those manuscripts, {{cquote|din palatu-palatu na man, bhuj vaahat sab shastr

 Life, death, day, night, happiness, sorrow, victory, defeat, rise and fall are according to destiny
 prithviraj raso kavy ke anek ansh chandabaradaayi ne kii rachana nahin he ye anek vidwaanon pramanit kiya he
 Prithviraj Raso is described in poetry in Gajni region, Prithviraj killed Ghori with an arrow
 jiske viruddh aneke itihasvidon main matbhed he
 After Ghori's slaying, Chand and Prithviraj killed themselves after killing each other, along with the mention that this information is mentioned by Chand
 kaai bhi vyakti apni mrityu kaa varnan kaise kar saktaa he? yahi sarvapratham prashn utpann hota he
 Thereafter, many proofs are obtained from the analysis of inscriptions etc
 jisase vah rachana chand ke dwaara rachit nahin, api tu kisi anya agyaat kavi ne us main akshep kiye hai aisa prathit hota he
 Although it has been corrupted by Parvartin in the original source of Prithviraj Raso Kavya, yet the description of Banaveedha in Rasokavya does not prove to be completely unhistorical
 ta upar sultan he, mat chuko chouhan
 Ghosh of the said line is very popular in Indian public with many centuries and is still today
 prithviraj ke dwaara chalaa baan ghori ko bhed hi detaa, parantu us se purv deshadrohion ne ghori kii sahaayta kar di or ghori kii pranaraksha ho gai
 How was Prithviraj's last period? There is enough evidence in Indian literature about this
 u pramaanon ke upasthaapan main prayek bhartiya strot kii paraspar bhinnata bhi he, parantu farsi-granth bhi vaise hi hai
 Among the medieval literature in which the mention of Prithviraj's death is found, Prithviraj Raso Kavya, Purana Prabandhanasagraha, Virudhidhavidhyavansa, Surajcharitamahakavya, Rajadarshini, kanhadde-prabandha, Prabandhchintamaniha and Hammiramhakaavya are included
 farsi-sahitya main tajul masir, javaami ul hikaayta yaa rivaayat, tabakaate nasiri, phutuhussalatin, tarikhe farista, guldashne ibrahimi or aaine-akabari jaise granth pramukh hai
 Ghori took Prithviraj as a prisoner and took him to Ghazni region
 chandabaradaayi us yuddh main anupasthit tha, kyonki vah swayan prithviraj ke aadesh se jammu main hahuli hammir naamak samant ke saath sandhi karne ke liye gaya tha
 There, a feudatory named Hammir rejected the advice of Chandbaradayi and made Chandbardayi a point in the temple of Jalpa-devi
 yuddh ke samaapti ke pashchaat chand muktah hua
 Prithviraj is defeated and he is a prisoner of Ghori
 atah vah apane samrat ke uddhaar ke liye gazani pradesh gaya
 Chand impressed Ghori with his eloquence there
 tatpashchaat unase ghori kaha ki, prithviraj andh hote hue bhi kushaltya lakshya bhedane main samarth hai
 Thus inspired Ghori to see that miracle
 tatpashchaat chand varnan karte hai ki, ghori ko prithviraj ne ek hi baan se kis prakaar maar diya
 After Ghori's death, Prithviraj and Chand committed suicide
 chand ke anusaar uski or prithviraj kii mrityu gazani pradesh main hui thi
 The above story is available in the shortest, medium, and major three versions of Prithviraj Raso poetry
 puratanprabandhsangrah kaa rachanakaal 1290 vikram sanvatsar vartate
 Clerical AD 1428 - 1471 is considered
 puratanprabandhsangrah ke "prithvirajprabandh" main ullikhit he ki, raja kii greeva main bhaar sthapit karke ghori ne suvarna kii shrinkhala se prithviraj ko bandi bana liya
 He then took Prithviraj to Yoginipur
 dehali ke rajaprasaad main ghori ne prithviraj ko puchha, "he rajan! yadi main tumko jeevandaan duun, to aap kya karoge?"
 Prithviraj replied, "I gave you life seven times, will you leave me once?"
 jiske nayanbudbudein nikaal diye gayi the, aise prithviraj ghori ke sammukh khedmagn ho gayi
 Then the prince of Prithviraj asked, Dev! What should be done This circuit is determined by destiny
 prithviraj bole, "yadi tum mujhe dhanushkand dete ho, to main isko maar saktaa hoon"
 Pradhan asked, Maharaj! Evave Karotu
 tatpashchaat vah pradhan ne ghori ke sameep jaakar kaha ki, is sthaan par na baitho
 So Ghori installed iron hull in his place and after that the head bowed to Prithviraj
 prithviraj ne apane baan ke aghat se lohputtal ke do bhaag kar diye
 Then he gave up Dhanushkand
 parantu lohe kii dhwani sunakar ve samaj gayi ki, ve nishphal hue hai
 So he thought in his mind that my work was still incomplete, so someone else would kill me
 tatpashchaat ghori ne ek mahagart main prithviraj ko phenk diya or usne prithviraj ko pashano se maarane kaa aadesh de diya
 If his blood falls on the ground, it will be auspicious that he kept on talking again and again
 1246 vikram sanvatsar main yawanon ne pashaanon maar-maar kar prithviraj ke praan le liye
 The topic of Banvedh is also found here, but the description is different
 yahan ghori ke sthaan par uskaa puttal bhedan kaa vivaran praapt hota he
 The place here is not Ghazni Pradesh, but it is Dehli
 prithviraj raso kavy main ullikhit he ki, prithviraj ne aatmghaat kiya, parantu jainacharya ke matanusaar yahan ek gart main pashaanon ke aghaton se prithviraj ke praan gayi
 Only the death of Prithviraj is mentioned in this story
 chandabaradaayi kii or ghori kii mrityu kaa varnan nahin praapt hota
 The creation of Chandrasekharkrit Surjancharitamahakavya is considered to be 1692 Vikram Samvatsar
 surjancharitamahakavy ke dashamsarg ke 120 wein shloke se 168 wein shloke paryant varnan miltaa he ki, digvijay abhiyaan ke antar prithviraj ne ghori ko bandi bana liya tha
 Twenty-one times Prithviraj made Ghori captive and then left, but he did Prithviraj
 ek yuddh main chal se prithviraj ko bandi bana kar ghori unako gazani pradesh le gaya
 There he blinded Prithviraj
 tatpashchaat prithviraj kaa mitra bhi gazani pradesh pahunchaa
 He inspired Prithviraj to retaliate
 prithviraj ne bolaa, mere paas sena nahin or netra bhi nahin hai
 How is revenge possible in such a situation? tab chandabaradaayi ne prithviraj ko shabdavedhvidya kaa samaran karavaaya or prithviraj pratishodh ke liye sajj ho gayi
 Chandrabardiyi went to the assembly of Ghori, planning a rhetoric with Prithviraj
 swalp hi dinon main chandabaradaayi ghori or uske mantrion kaa vishwasabhak ban gaya
 Then one day Chandbaradiyi said in the meeting, Prithviraj is able to pierce the chains of iron even in the dark
 unke us kaushal ko ekwar to darshana hi chaiye
 Ghori agreed to see Prithviraj's skills after Chandbaradiyi asked
 tatpashchaat rajaprasaad main ek stambh par suvarnashrinkhala baandhakar yavansainikon ne prithviraj ke haath main dhanushkand diye
 Chandbaradiyi said to Ghori that, you yourself command Prithviraj three times to shoot the arrow, only after that he will do thundering
 is prakaar ghori te mukh se shabd nikalne ke anukshan hi prithviraj ne baan chalaa diya
