kuch lakshan shakson kii uttarjivita main sahaayta karte hai or kuch usamen baadha daalate hai
 The more customized personas of the environment give more children to the next generation than their less adapted rivals
 jo lakshan uttarjivan or prajnan main baadha daalate hai wo kuch pidiyon ke baad lupt ho jate hai
 The traits that help in survival and reproduction accumulate from generation to generation
 is prakaar shakson kii uttarjivan or prajnan kii asmaan kshamta ke kaaran dhire-dhire aabaadiyon main parivartan ho jaataa he
 Observations of differences in animals and plants became the basis of the theory of natural selection
 darwin ne dekha ki orchidon or kiton main ek khaas saajhedaari hoti he jo padpon ke paragan main madad karti he
 He observed that orchids have many structures that attract insects, so that the pollen of the flowers sticks to their bodies
 is prakaar se kit ek nar orchid se ek maadaa orchid tak paraag dhote hai
 Despite the intricate appearance of the orchids, these specialized parts are made from the same basic structures that other flowers form
 apni pustak orchidon kaa nishechan main darwin prastaavit karte hai ki orchid pushp pehle se maujuud pushp bhaagon se prakritik varan kii prakriya ke dwaara parivesh ke zyada anukulit bane hai
 Darwin was still researching and experimenting with his ideas that he received a letter from Alfred Russell Wallace
 is chitthee main vailes ne darwin ke siddhant ke jaise ek siddhant kaa varnan kiya tha
 Due to this both of them jointly published these principles
 vailes or darwin donon jivan ke itihaas ko ek vansh vriksh kii tarah dekhte the, jisamen shakhaon kii nok aaj kii jatiyon ko darshaati he or shakhaon ke vibhajit hone kii jagah ek saajhe purvaj ko
 Darwin said that living things are relatives
 iskaa matlab tha ki sara jivan thode se saral purvajon se utpann hua he
 And it was also likely that all organisms had the same ancestor
 darwin ne prakritik varan dwaara kram-vikaas ke apane siddhant ko 1859 main apni pustak jeevajatiyon kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 His theory means that all organisms, including humans, are the byproduct of continuous natural processes
 iske kaaran kuch dharmik guton ne kram-vikaas ke siddhant par aapatti uthaai he
 In contrast, more than 99 percent of the people in the scientific community support this theory
 aksar prakritik varan ko swasthitam kii uttarjivita kaa paryaay samajha jaataa he, par ye abhivyakti 1864 main prakashit harbart spencer kii pustak jeevigyaan ke siddhant se janmi he, jo darwin kii kitaab ke paanch varsh baad prakashit hui thi
 Survival of the fittest misunderstands the process of natural selection because natural selection is not just about survival and not always the healthiest
 darwin ke prakritik varan ke siddhant ne kram-vikaas ke aadhunik siddhant kii neenv rakhi
 Their research and observations have shown that individuals in a population differ from each other, some of these differences are from parents, and natural selection chooses and discards these differences
 par ve in bhinnataaon kaa kaaran nahin bataa sake
 Like biologists before them they continued to understand that genetic traits were the cause of use or non-use, and that the traits that were ingested over their lifetimes could be passed on to their children
 unhone iske udhaaharan khojane kii koshish kii
 They thought that the legs of large flightless birds like the ostrich would have been overly powerful from generation to generation, and their wings would have been weakened from generation to generation due to less flying
 is galatarahami ko "adhigrahit lakshanon kii anuvaanshikta" kaha jaataa tha jo ki jin baptist lamark dwaara 1809 main prastaavit siddhant "jatiyon kaa parivartan" kaa bhaag thi
 At the end of the 19th century this theory was called Lamarckism
 darwin ne jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshanon kii anuvaanshikta samajhane ke liye pangenesis naam kaa ek asafal siddhant prastaavit kiya
 The experiments of August Weissmann in the 1880s showed that the symptoms acquired during their lifetimes could not be passed on to children
 iske kaaran kuch samay main lamarkwaad ko tyaag diya gaya
 How new traits are given to parents by offspring is answered by Gregor Mendel's pioneering work on genetics
 matar ke paudhon kii kai pidiyon par kiye gaye unke prayogon ne sabit kiya ki mata or pita main sex koshikaon ke gathan ke samay anuvaanshik jaankaree vibhajit ho jaati he or nishechan ke samay mata or pita se mili jaankaree yadrichhik dhang se jud jaati he
 This can be compared to playing cards where an organism gets half its leaves at random from the mother and the other half at random from the father
 mendal ne is jaankaree ko factors kaha, par baad main jin naam zyada prachlit ho gaya
 Genes are the basic unit of genetics
 inamen vah jaankaree hoti he jo jeev ke shaareerik vikaas or vyavhaar ko nirdeshit karti he
 Genes are made of DNA
 diene ek lanbaa anu he jo newcliotide kehalaae jane vaale chote anuon se banataa he
 Genetic information is stored in DNA as a series of nucleotides
 diene kii tulana ek lekh se kii ja sakati he jisamen newcliotide varnon kaa kaam karte hai
 Just as an article composed of a series of characters stores information, DNA composed of a series of nucleotides stores genetic information
 jin diene kii varnmaala ke varnon se bane nirdesh hote hai
 All genes come together like an "instruction manual" which contains all the information about making and functioning an organism
 diene main likhe gaye in nirdeshon kaa utparivartan ke kaaran badalanaa aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata ko badhata he
 DNA is contained in chromosomes inside the capillaries
 nishechan ke samay mata-pita se mili chromosomon ke yadrichhik mishran se santan ko jeenon kaa adwitiya sangyojan miltaa he
 This random mixing of genes during sexual reproduction also increases the genetic variation of the population
 aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata kisi duusari aabaadi ke saath prajnan karne se bhi badhati he
 For this reason, the population may have genes which were not already present in it
 kram-vikaas ek yadrichhik prakriya nahin he
 Although mutations in DNA occur randomly, natural selection is not a random process, the probability of survival and reproduction depends on the environment
 kram-vikaas arabon varshon ke trutipurna pratilipikaran par prakritik varan kaa parinaam he
 The result of evolution is not a well-formed organism
 prakritik varan kaa parinaam apane maujuuda parivesh ke anukulit jeev hote hai
 Progress is not progress towards any ultimate goal
 kram-vikaas zyada viksit, zyada budhimaan yaa zyada jatil jeev banane kaa prayaas nahin karata he
 For example, the flea scorpion is a descendant of a winged creature called a fly, and pythons still have small structures that are remnants of their ancestors' hind legs
 parivesh main teevr parivartan aam taur par adhiktam jatiyon ko vilupt kar detaa he
 More than 99 percent of the castes on the earth have become extinct
 prithvi par jivan kii shruwaat ke baad se paanch pramukh samuhik viluptiyaan ho chuki hai
 Due to these there has been a big and sudden decline in the diversity of castes
 in main sabase tazaa kriteshs-peliosin vilupti ghatana he, jo 6
6 karod varsh purv hui thi
 Genetic drift refers to the change in the frequency of alleles in the populations of a caste
 elil kisi jin ke vibhinn roopantaron ko kehete hai
 They determine hair color, skin color, eye color, blood type etc
 genetic drift aabaadi main nae elil nahin laati he, par ye kisi elil ko aabaadi se hataa kar genetic vividhta ko kam kar sakati he
 Genetic drift occurs by random selection of alleles
 chayan sahi myne main yadrichhik tab hota he jab us par koi bahari bal prabhaav nahin daalata he
 For example, a random selection is to remove some marbles from an opaque bag filled with marbles of different colors at the same measurement and weight
 koi shaks apane elil apane bacchon ko de paaegaa yaa nahin, ye uske jivit rahane par nirbhar karata he jisamen sanyog bhi bhoomika nibhaataa he
 This process of changing the frequency of alleles in the population due to coincidence is called genetic drift
 genetic drift badi aabaadiyon kii tulana main choti aabaadiyon par zyada prabhaav daalati he
 The Hardy – Weinberg rule states that the frequency of alleles will not change over generations in a large population occurring in the Hardy – Weinberg society
 magar ek paryaapt aakaar kii aabaadi kaa is samyavastha main pahunchnaa asambhav he kyonki is samyavastha main pahunchane ke liye ye paanch chijen jaruri hai
 1) The population size should be infinite
 2) utparivartan kii dar shunya pratishat honi chahie, kyonki utparivartan eleelon ko badal saktaa he yaa nae elil bana saktaa he
 3) There should not be migration from or into the population, as individuals coming into or leaving the population can change the frequency of alleles
 4) aabaadi par koi chaynaatmak dabaav nahin hone chahie, arthath kisi shaks ke uttarjivan yaa prajnan kii sambhaavna dusron se zyada nahin honi chahie
 5) The intercourse should be completely random, where all males are equally attractive mates
 yah alilon kii sahi myne main yadrichhik milawat sunishchit karata he
 The population in the Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium corresponds to a deck of cards; Regardless of the number of times the deck is thrown, there will be no new leaf and no leaf will come out
 yahan aabaadi main eleelon kii tulana deck ke patton se kii gai he
 Population Bottlenac refers to the rapid decline of a race's population due to environmental events
 ek sahi myne main yadrichhik aabaadi bottlenake kisi elil kaa paksh nahin letaa he; arthath yah yadrichhik hota he ki koun se shaks jivit rahenge
 a bottleneck can reduce or eliminate the genetic diversity of a population
 iske baad kii genetic drift aabaadi kii genetic vividhta ko or kam kar sakati he
 Lack of genetic diversity may place populations at risk of other selective pressures
 aabaadi bottlenake kaa ek udhaaharan "uttari eliphant jalavyaghr" he
 The population of the Northern Elephant Sea was reduced by thirty persons due to the excessive hunting of the 19th
 sangrakshan ke kaaran in kii aabaadi ek lakh se zyada ho gai he or lagaataar bad rahi he
 The effects of bottleneck on the population are clearly visible
 aabaadi main genetic vividhta ke abhaav main in jalavyaghron ko rogon se kaaphi khatra he or anuvanshiki vikaar hone kii bahut sambhaavna he
 The founder's influence occurs when a small group of populations diverge from the rest of the population to form a new population
 aksar iskaa kaaran bhugolic algaav hota he
 The frequency of alleles in this new population is often different from that of the old population
 agali pidiyon kii genetic banaavat sansthaapakon kii genetic banaavat par nirbhar karegi jo puraani aabaadi se alag hogi
 An example of the founder's influence is found in the 1744 Pennsylvania transfusion of the Amish people
 amishon kii pencilvenia kii colony ke do sansthaapakon main elice–vine creveld sanglakshan ke risasive elil the
 Due to the practice of Amish people not marrying outside their community for many generations, the frequency of Ellis-van Kreveld syndrome among them is much higher than the rest of the population

 His spiritual creations are based on Vaishnava philosophy
 annamacharya ramanujacharya sampradaay ke the
 He took initiation from Sri Satagopa Yatindra at Ahobila Math
 
 He dwells on the subjects of morality, Dharma, righteousness, etc
 in his spiritual songs
 His erotic songs worship Lord Venkateswara by describing his amorous and romantic adventures, a tradition now known as Madhura Bhakti
 Most of these songs describe the adventures of Venkateswara and Alamel Manga, while others describe the Bhakti of Krishna's devotees
 He was one of the first few who opposed the social stigma towards the untouchable castes in his era, with his sankeertanas explaining that the relationship between God and human is the same irrespective of the latters' color, caste and financial status, in beautiful yet powerful usage of words in his song "brahmam Okkate Parabrahmam Okkate


" His choice of words gives a mellifluous tone to his songs, charming the listener
 His prodigious literary career that produced about 32,000 songs, many of which were greatly acclaimed, has earned him a place among the all-time greats of telugu literature
 His meeting with Purandara Dasa in Tirumala
 Once when Purandara Dasa visited Tirumala he heard a great old man singing his composition in front of the Almighty Srinivasa
 He at once approached the old man and said that the song was composed for practising music
 At the same time, Sri Sri Vyasaraya of the Vyasaraya mutt intervened and introduced the great old man as Talapaka Anammacharya to Purandara Dasa
 This is one of the major event in the history of Music where two great souls met each other and paid due respect to each other
purandara Dasa is revered as the Father of Carnatic Music who formulated the music as it is today
 The composition Sri Annamacharya sang is like Padumanabha Paramapurusha An ardent devotee of Lord Venkateswara of Tirupati, AP, Annamacharya successfully composed more than 32,000 sankeertanas in the Carnatic music tradition
 Though a great feat in itself, it still falls short of the estimated 475,000 sankeertanas composed by Purandara Dasa
 While enjoying popularity in his own days, his compositions were forgotten for over three centuries for some inexplicable reason
 They were later found engraved on copper plates, hidden for centuries inside the Sri Venkateswara temple at Tirumala
 Annamacharya considered his compositions as floral offerings to God
 In the poems, he praises Venkateswara, describes his love for him, argues and quarrels with the Lord, confesses the devotee's failures and apprehensions, and surrenders himself to Venkateshwara
 His songs are classified into the Adhyaatma and Sringaara sankeertanas genres
 Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has been successfully endeavoring to preserve the rich heritage of his compositions
 The sustained efforts of dedicated scholars and musicians during the last thirty years have also helped revive their popularity among the Telugu people
 The sankeertanas engraved on copper plates were found in the Tirumala temple just opposite the Hundi, concealed in a very small room
 It is said only 12,000 of the 32,000 sankeertanas were found
 No leads have been available to trace the remaining sankeertanas
 Some personnel involved in deciphering the plates say that the people of those days could have melted the copper plates for personal use
 The telugu film "annamaya" was based on his story
 It was released on 13th May 1997

 It was produced under VMC banner
 The film undoubtably left an indelible mark in the audience
 His sankirtanas are very popular amongst Carnatic singers and connoisseurs, especially in the state of Andhra Pradesh
 The programme, lakshagala Sankirthanarchana, some 160,000 people sang seven Annamayya keertanas in Hyderabad, creating a new Guinness record on May 10, 2009

 Historians consider seven such crush wars

 The main destination of the journey was the large church in Jerusalem, built by the mother of the first Christian emperor Constantain of Rome in the fourth century, near the tomb of Christ

 In the seventh century, Islam was propagated at great speed and the successor caliphs of the Prophet established their rule over near and far countries

 This situation changed in the 11th century
 madhya asian turk jati kii itani janavruddhi hui ki vah or faili tathaa islam dharm grahan kar liya
 Especially during this time, the Saljuq Turks greatly increased their power from the Caspian Sea to Jerusalem
 udhar purv main turkon kii ek duusari shakha ne sultan mahmud ke netritv main bharat par akraman kiya or uskaa pashchimottar bhaag dabaa liya
 The Saljuqs also occupied the internecine Palestine of many countries, and Jerusalem and its holy places became subject to it in 1071 AD
 is samay se isaayiyon kii yatra kathin or ashankapurna ho gai
 On the other hand, the power of the Norman race developed in Western Europe
 narman england ke shaasha ban gaye; france ke ek bhaag par ve pehle se hi chhaae hue the, 1070 ke lagbhag unhone sicili, dweep musalamaanon se jeeta or usase mila hua italy kaa dakshini bhaag bhi dabaa liya
 Consequently, the Mediterranean Sea, which was under pressure from the Muslim rulers of North Africa, opened up to Christians of this time
 italy ke kai swantatra nagar vaanijya main kushal the or ab or bhi unnatisheel ho gaye
 Their navy grew and the Christians also got a new route to their sacred land
 par isai main prabal foot bhi thi
 In 395 AD, the Roman Empire was divided into two parts
 pashchimi bhaag, jisaki rajdhani rome thi, 476 main uttar kii barbar jatiyon ke akraman se tut gaya
 But the influence of the Pope remained constant and greatly increased when these nations became Christians; Even the Pope had unquestioned dominance over Western Europe
 iske shaasha pope se aashirwad praapt karte the or yadi pope aprasann hokar kisi shaasha kaa bahishkaar karata, to use kathin praayshchitt karnaa hota tha or prachur dhan dand ke rup main pope ko dena padataa tha
 The emperor was elected one of the rulers of the region, who was considered the co-operative of the pope and was called the Holy Roman Emperor
 isai jagat ke purvi bhaag kii rajdhani kustutuniyaan main thi or vahaan greek jati ke samrat shashan karte the
 Apart from Eastern Europe, his kingdom was also on Asia Minor
 turko ne asia miner ke adhikansh bhaag par kabja kar liya tha, keval rajdhani ke nikat kaa or kuch samudratat kaa kshetra roman samrat ke paas rah gaya tha
 The emperor sought the help of Western Christians in this crisis
 rome kaa pope swayan hi pavitra bhoomi ko turko se mukt karaane kaa icchhuk tha
 An influential campaigner enthused the public for the crusades in France and Italy
 falswaroop lagbhag chah lakh krushdhar prastut ho gaye
 The religious differences in the eastern and western parts of the Christian world were so great that in 1054 the Pope of Rome and Patriarch of the city of Costantin castigated each other
 pashchim kaa unnatisheel raajnneetik dal purvi samrat ko, jo unani tha, nikamma samajhataa tha
 His belief was that only with the establishment of Norman rule in this empire could Turkey win the war
 in virodhon tathaa matbhedon kaa krush yudhon ke itihaas par gaharaa prabhaav padaa
 Two types of crusaders participated in this war
 ek to france, germany or italy ke jansadharan, jo lakhon kii sankhya main pope or sanyasi peetar kii prerana se apane bal bacchon ke saath gadiyon par samaan ladakar peetar or anya shraddhonmatta netaaon ke peeche pavitra bhoomi kii ore march, 1096 main thalmaarg se chal die
 Many of them were defiant and all were hostile towards the heretics
 unke paas bhojan saamagree or parivahan saadhan kaa abhaav hone ke kaaran ve maarg main lut khasot or yahudiyon kii hatya karte gaye jiske falswaroop bahuterey maare bhi gaye
 Seeing this trend, the eastern emperor took him across the Basphorus without waiting for another party when he reached Constantine city
 vahaan se badhkar jab ve turko dwaara shasit kshetra main ghuse to, maare gaye
 The second party was the armies of many well-deserved feudatories from Western Europe who reached Constantine by different routes
 inke naam is prakaar hai:- The eastern emperor promised these armies in exchange for the facilities of navigation and military support, and promised them that the former territories of the empire, which were captured by the Turks, would be given to the emperor if they were won
 yadhyapi is pratigya kaa puraa paalan nahin hua or samrat kii sahaayta yathesht nahin praapt hui, phir bhi krushdhar senaaon ko is yuddh main paryaapt safalataa mili
 As soon as they were confronted, the Turks gave the city and its related territories to the emperor
 phir sena ne dorilium sthaan par turko ko parajeet kiya ore vahaan se antiok main pahunchakar aath maheene ke ghere ke baad use jeet liya
 Before this, Baldwin separated his army and took possession of the state of Edessa under Armenia on the east
 antiok se navbanr, 1098 main chalakar senaayen maarg main sthit tripolis, tir, tathaa sizariyaa ke shaskaon se dand lete hue june, 1099 main jerusalem pahaunchi or paanch saptaah ke ghere ke baad july, 1099 main usapar adhikaar kar liya
 They ruthlessly murdered the Muslim and Jewish residents of the city

 Their migration is as regular and gradual as that of the seasons, and it has elicited curiosity and curiosity in humans since ages, even as the Red Indians have named their calendar months after the arrival of migrating birds
 chidiyon ke pravrajan ke vishay ke maanya pandit landsbaro tomson ne pravrajan kii vyakhya is prakaar kii he: Long ago, it was believed that as some mammals and mammals go into dormancy to avoid frost in the autumn, in the same way that ababil, calvinka and cuckoo also cool
 aisi dharna arestu ke samay se hi chali aa rahi thi
 The ability to move in birds has developed immensely due to the thermal power, wings and amazing power of flight

 Through migration, sparrows also get two favorable areas in two adverse seasons
 ek kshetra main ve nivas karti hai or prajnan karti he or duusare kshetra main bhojan tathaa vishram ke hetu jaati hai
 It is a law of nature that birds lay eggs only in the cold part of the migration zone

 Often the migration is from north to south, although some migration is also from east to west
 pravrajan kuch kilometre se lekar hajaaron kilometre tak kaa hota he, jaise kuch chidiyaan himalay kii adhik oonchaai se utarkar uttari bharat ke samtal bhaagon main chali aati hai or kuch hajaaron kilometre sudur dakshin main chali jaati hai
 The most distant migration is done by the North Polar Kurri
 yah pravrajan prayek varsh do baar hota he
 It travels southward during the winter of the Arctic, crossing the world and returning to the South Pole Antarctic after spending the summer
 is prakaar jane or aane kii ek ore kii yatra main lagbhag 17,742 kilometre kii duuri tay karti he
 Several theories have been proposed regarding the onset of migration in sparrows
 pravrajan se chidiyon ko nimnlikhit laabh hote hai : The migration of sparrows depends on both internal and external stimuli of the bird
 prayogon se prakat hota he ki bahya uttejnaaon main se din kii avadhi main parivartan pramukh he ; ant : uttejnaa prajnanaangon se utpann hormone dwaara praapt hoti he
 Many experiments and observations of how the target destination of migration is determined and how the birds find their way to this destination have not yet received a satisfactory answer
 sharatkaleen awasakshetra main sharad ritu bitaane ke pashchaat vasant ritu main prajnan kshetra athwa greeshm-awaas-kshetra main vayask naron kaa pratham punaragaman hota he
 This is followed by adult females and finally by the minor sparrows
 kintu sharad main yah kram ulat jaataa he
 First minor birds and females depart for the southern journey and later adult males
 dakshin kii yatra bade itaminaan se or sthaan sthaan par ruk rukkar hoti he
 Young children or teenagers, who are only a few months old, guide the convoy and adults follow them later
 yah kaise hota he? isaki anek vyakhyaayein kii gai hai
 The more accepted opinion among them is that due to the migration of many generations every year, birds have to create a special kind of neem according to the caste tradition, without any prior experience, at the right time, without any prior experience
 Migration of experience has also become an inborn quality
 pakshi sudur pradeshon ke raste kaa kis prakaar pataa lagaate hai? iske vishay main bhi anek anumaan hai jinamein se kuch prithvi ke chumbakatv ke prati sookshm samvedansheeltaa, sthalchihron kii drushti dwaara pahchaan ityadi hai
 But foreseeing, the determination of the distant destination and its path in yesterday's birds remains mysterious
 jis prakaar manushya sudur kii yatra kar phir apane ghar ko laut aata he, thik usee bhanti pakshi hajaaron kilometre kii yatra kar or sharad ritu kisi sudur sthaan main vyateet kar na keval apane greeshm-nivas-kshetra main hi pahunch jate hai, balki apane tyakt ghonsle main bhi pahunch jate hai
 It has been established by the method of ringing the birds that in Europe, the abbeel often reaches not only the same settlement, but the same house to which she left and went on a distant journey
 ababilein is yatra main 9,677 kilometre kii duuri tay karti hai
 The same thing is found in other real migrating birds
 anek varshon ke nirikshan ke falswaroop prakashit kuch gyaat tathyon se pataa chalata he ki chidiyaan na keval apane nivaskshetra or puraane need main hi pahunch jaati he, balki thik usee din lautakar aa jaati hai jis din ve pichley varsh main lautakar ai thim
 Therefore, when traveling for such a long time, it is even more amazing that the birds return to their nests at a certain time
 bharat ke vibhinn kshetron main sharad main aagaman karanevaale prayek sharadyatri pakshi kii sthiti bhinn hoti he
 Take for example any location, such as the Bhopal region of central India

 Some of these travelers are left behind and can be seen in Bhopal throughout the autumn
 inkaa ham vaastavik sharadyatri ke antargat vargeekaran kar sakate hai, kintu kuch keval sharad ritu ke aagaman par thode samay ke liye hi rahete hai or uske baad dikhaai nahin padate kyonki ve vahaan se or aage yatra ke liye prasthaan kar chuke hote hai
 They again appear in early summer, when they return to the north
 ye sharad or vasant main pravrajan karanevaale yatri hote hai
 Some are visible in the autumn, when traveling south, but not visible when they return to their residence again in the spring, because they return via another route
 
 atev ve pakshi bhopal main sharad ritu main dikhaai padate hai or vasant main kisi duusare bhaag main dikhaai padate hai
 Some sparrows migrate from one part to another within the country itself, such as Shah Bulbul or Dudhanju, Golden Polak and Naurang
 yah sthaneey pravrajan desh ke uttari bhaag yaa pahaado kii talahati main adhik hota he, jahaan bumadhyarekha kii apeksha rituparivartan atyadhik prabhavakaari hota he
 Like real migrating birds, these also have a gradual and regular migration
 desh ke kisi bhaag main koi jati greeshm ritu main, koi jati barsaat main or koi jati sharad main aagaman karti he
 Apart from this, there is another type of translocation which happens due to local conditions affecting the diet, such as heat, drought or flood, etc
, or a particular type of flowering and ripening season
 us samay chidiyaan ek kshetra se duusare kshetra main chali jaati hai
 Sometimes sparrows are also found traveling to other areas in search of food, leaving them in their proper habitat, bound by extraordinary circumstances
 atev kisi kshetra main kisi bhi samay main pakshiyon kii jansankhya sthaayee nahin rahati, kyonki sabhi kshetron main pakshiyon kaa aagaman or niryaman sarvada hota rahata he
 The birds living in the high mountains of the Himalayas come down in winter and thus come down from the stormy weather and the Himalayas
 vasant ke aagaman par jab baraf galane lagati he or himrekha upar kii ore bad jaati he, tab ve andey dene ke liye pahaado ke upree bhaag main pun: chadh jaati hai
 This sequence continues not only in birds living in height, but also in birds living below

 The sparrows are put on a ring and their full details are written and left in a booklet
 ab in chidiyon ke sudur sthanon pahunchne par inhen markar athwa phasaakar inaki anguthi utaar lee jaati he or ye jis sthaan se udi thim, us pate par bhej di jaati he
 When a large number of such types of tables are assembled, then these tables are analyzed and based on them, the path of migration of a particular species of bird or any other problem is determined

 We have come to know from the receipt of similar ringed sparrows in Bikaner that some white bucks that come to our country, in the autumn, are from Germany
 bharat main is prakaar kaa pakshivalayan kaa kaary bahut thodaa hua he
 But the information received from everything that has happened has proved very important and useful
 pravrajan karanevaali chidiyon kii gati vibhinn chidiyon main vibhinn hoti he or yah gati kai baton, jaise vaayu kii disha, mausam ityadi par nirbhar karti he
 Ducks and geese have been found to have a flight speed of 64 to 80 kilometers per hour and 90 to 97 kilometers or more in favorable weather
 din raat nirantar udakar yatra karanevaali chidiyon main yah gati 9
5 se 17
7 kilometre prati ghanta hoti he
 From the following table it can be estimated which distance a bird travels in a single flight: purvi sunaharaa tittibh bina kahin ruke lagaataar udakar 3226
00 kilometre ke khule samudr ko paar kar jaataa he
 These Tittibhas visit India in the autumn
 yah pashchimi alaska or uttar-purv siberia main andey detaa he or hawaii dwipon kaa niyamit rup se bhraman karata he
 The female who wished to lay eggs only in Japan, spends the winter in eastern Australia and Tazmania, thus must fly a distance of 4839
00 kilometers without stopping uninterruptedly
 kuch or bhi aisi chidiyaan he, jo bina dana pani ke bahut badi duuri paar jaati hai
 Among the Indian birds traveling far and wide, perhaps the Bhandu pheasant is the closest place to lay eggs in the Himalayas
 kuch jhandu teetar jaada nilgiri athwa dakshin kii anya pahadiyon main bitaate hai or uske bich anya kahin nahin milte
 This is so clear that they must cross at least 2419
5 kilometers in one flight
 pehle aisa vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki pravrajan karanevaali chidiyaan bahut oonchaai par udati hai, kyonki isse unako, sthaan kaa nirdhaaran karne, hawa ke dwaara utpann avrodh kam hone, ityadi kaa laabh hota he
 But now it has been found that these migratory birds fly at an altitude of 396
24 meters if they do not cross any high mountain, and rarely the bird is raised to a height of 914
4 meters
 jab samudr paar karnaa hota he athwa yahan kisi prakaar ke vriksh yaa pahaad kaa avrodh nahin hota, tab kuch chidyaan swabhaavat: isse bhi kam oonchaai par udati hai
 Yes, birds can fly from very high altitudes if needed

 According to Ibn Batuta, a Moroccan traveler a century later, he stayed here in India from 1335 to 1342 AD and also visited the temples of Khajuraho and according to him, Khajuraho was called "kajra" at that time
 madhya bhartiya kshetra main avasthit khajuraho ke mandir jin par 13veen se 18veen shatabdi tak bhinn-bhinn muslim shaskaon ne shashan kiya tha is dauraan main kai mandiron ke saath apavitra vyavhaar bhi kiya tha
 In 1495 BC Alexander Lodi undertook an expedition in which the temples of Khajuraho were destroyed
 khajuraho ke dur-dur or algaav logon ne musalamaanon dwaara nirantar vinaash se hindu mandir or jain mandiron ko surakshit rakhaa
 Over the centuries, vegetation and forests acquired more and more temples of Khajuraho
 1930 ke dashak main yahan ke sthaneey hinduon ne britani surveykshak tii es bart kii madad kii jisase bart ne khajuraho ke mandiron kii punah khoj kii
 Shortly thereafter, British archaeologist Alexander Cunningham revisited Burt's discovery
 unki report se pataa chalata he ki yahan mandiron main hindu yogi or hazaron kii sankhya main hindu log chupake se yahan march or farvari maah ke shivaratri utsav manaaya karte the
 In 1852, Messe had photographed the temples of Khajuraho
 khajuraho naam jo pehle kabhi kharjuravahak ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha, sabase pehle ise sanskrit main kaha jaataa tha, or jise sandesavahak yaa dharak kehete the
 ) According to local legends, it is said that there were two gold-palm trees in front of the temple but when they were rediscovered they were not palm trees
 kaningham ne 1850 or 1860 ke dashak main apane kaary ke antargat bataaya tha ki mandiron lakshmana ke aasapaas pashchimi samooh, javeri ke purvi samooh or daldev ke dakshini samooh main samoohikrut tha
 Khajuraho is one of the four sacred sites related to the deity in which Shiva
 iskaa mul or dizin vidwaanon ke adhyayan kaa vishay he 
 Shobhata Punj says that the origin of the temple reflects Hindu mythology in which Khajuraho is the place where Shiva's marriage took place, which is mentioned in verse 5

 roman dharm auki samrajya kii dharmik evam raajnneetik mahatta ke kaaran samast pashchimi yorape main latin sarvapramukh bhashaa ban gai thi
 The study of texts of that language was considered extremely important
 vah bhashaa samast vidya or gyaan kii prapti kaa ek prakaar se praveshdwar samajhi jane lagi thi
 Western germination also sprouted from these Latin-word lists, which were called Glosses
 'glassri' shabd bhi isi mul se vyupann he
 Glosses meant glossaries
 'latin' granthon ke padhane vaale grantho ke haashie par unke dubondhy or kathin shabdon ko likh diya karte the
 Through his memory or with the help of other experts, sometimes he used to write the meaning of these words in light letters in simple 'latin' and sometimes in a different language
 isi shabd ko 'glass' kehete hai
 The ancient Roman language was not very difficult for 'roman' landowners
 par duurasthon ke liye vah bhashaa durbodhya thi
 Therefore, in view of the remote areas of 'celtic' and 'teutonic' regions, the above 'glass method' became more useful
 vyapak rup se or apekshaakrit adhik vistrut aayam main is prakaar kii shabdsuchiyaan baniin
 Through them, such ancient words of Saxon, English, 'irish', 'oriental German' etc
 have been preserved in large quantities in which many words of those languages are rare today
 kaha jaataa he ki england main utpann 'jones di galandia' ne latin ke ek dictionerius kaa nirmaan—1224 een0 main kiya tha
 This was a small collection of Latin words
 vishayvarganusaar vaakyon main prayog nidarshan ke rup main bhashaa ke aarambhik seekhneyvaalon kii upyogita ke nimitt iskaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 The word 'dictionary' was also probably first used in this dictionary
 14veen shatee ke uttarardh main bhi aise kuch kosh bane
 Later, copies of the above words and meanings were started on different leaves
 unhen ekatra bhi kiya jane laga
 This word collection has become very useful for making sense of the words of the Latin language
 tattat soochiyon main samavisht shabdon ko aage chalakar glacerium kehane lage, jiskaa arth he shabdarthasuchee
 On the basis of these 'glasarium' in the 16th-17th, alphabetical dictionaries and expressive collections were created
 acaradikram—15veen shatee se bhi do teen sau varsh purv yorape kii vibhinn bhashaaon main anek prakaar ke vibhinn virgon ke shabdon kii suchiyaan sangruhit hone lagi thi
 Synonyms were classified in these glossaries
 jis prakaar sanskrit ke amarkosh aadi granthon main apni drushti se paryaayavachi shabdon kaa vargashrith sangrah miltaa he usee prakaar in shabdsuchiyon main sharir ke angon paariwarik sambandhon, manushya ke padon or shraniyon, gharelu evam palit jaanwaron, junglee pashuon, machhliyon, vrikshon, vyavsaayon, vastrabhupanon, astrashastron, carch kii saamagreeyon, rog aadi ke naamon kii arth- sahit suchiyaan sangruhit hoti thi
 These were called 'vocabularium'
 angreji kaa 'vocabuleri' shabd bhi isi se nirgat he
 Apart from paper, they were also collected on leather
 mulat bhinn drushti se sankalit hone par bhi 'glans' or 'vocabuleri' donon kaa vyaavhaarik upyog bhashagyaan main sahayata denevaale upkaran ke rup main hone laga tha
 Hence, these two types of word lists are often "collected"
 swagyan se athwa dusron kii 'glansri' or 'vocabuleri' se nae shabdon ko lekar shabdsuchiyon ke swami unamem nae shabd jodate rahete the
 By copying these other person could also get their collection from time to time
 pratilipi parampara dwaara inkaa prasar or vistaar hota chal rahaa tha
 The Dictionary Dictionary created by Sir Thomas Elliot is also of special importance and is a demonstrator of Nutanpath
 je0 dablyoo0 vidals dwaara angreji ke aarambhik latin pathakon kii suvidha ke liye rachit 'angreji—latin' kaa laghushbdkosh bhi vishayanusaari virgon main hi granthit he
 But being a dictionary of 'latin in English' has special significance
 isse bhi adhik mahatv kaa ek bahubhashi latin shabdkosh— 1339i0 main ore asteam ne banaaya tha jisamen latin shabdon ke samanarthak angreji shabdon ke alaava europe kii anek navyabhashaon ke bhi paryaay die gaye the
 After 1547, English and neo-european languages also started making lexicons
 pratilipikaran ke madhyam se prasaarit in soochiyon main shabdon ore vaakyanshon ko upyogita kii drushte se acaradi krmanusaar vyavasthit karnaa adhik laabhkaar jaan pada
 It is from here that the Acardi Kramanusari collection system begins
 shabd yaa vaakyansh ke aarambhik prathamakshar ko krambaddh suchi main lipic sangruhit kar detaa tha
 It was not seen as binary or ancestral
 at: is paddati ko varnmalanusaari prathamakshar kram kah sakate hai
 This stage became prevalent through the effortless system of finding convenient method by removing the perceived difficulty in the list of thousands of words
 falat: dhire—dhire usamen vikaas hota gaya or prathamakshar ke saath saath dwitauya, tritiy aksharon par bhi dhyaan diya jane laga
 Then gradually, according to alphabetical method, word began to be used in the modern era
 — angreji koshon main sarvapratham likhit latin shabdsuchiyon kaa saral latin or angreji main arth dene se koshkala kaa prarambh hua
 It was the first form
 — duusare sopan par angreji shabdsuchiyon kaa tathaa latin or angreji shabdasangrahon kaa vistaar hua
 - In the third phase, the english-latin vocabulary was done
 — chaturth avasthaa main angroji or itar bhashaaon ke kosh bane
 - In the fifth step, there are lexicons and dictionaries of clit words of English
 veshli dwaara inamen saamaanya shabdon ko jodne ke saath saath vyutpattinirdesh kii bhi cheshtaa kii gai
 Now examples of word usage are also being collected
 — chhathi avasthaa main ucch koti ke koshanirmaan kii cheshtaa or arthmpashtikaran ke liye sahitya main prayukt uddharanon kaa upyog prarambh hua
 Along with this, or some already started the feeling of implying the pronunciation of the language words used in the English dictionary
 — ashtum sthiti vah he jab richardsan dwaara shabdavyakhya chhodvar keval ladaahranmadhyam se arthbodh kaa prayaas hua
 And later the culmination of all this is seen in the Mahakosh, created by the inspiration of Dr
 Trench
 shabdoncchharan, shabd, arth shabdaprayog or vyapatti sambanddh shabdaproyag ke itihascram aadi ko vistrut or aitihaasik ayamo ke saath kosh main anusyut karne kii cheshtaa hui he
 For a detailed description, see the history of English dictionaries
 koshvigyaan kii aarambhik sthiti main pashchim ke kosh bhi paryaay suchit karte hai
 Gradually, various meanings were also instructed
 par vyakaran, uccharansanket, shabdarthprayog kaa itihaas, vyutpattinirdesh or udaarahan dwaara taatparyvivaran kaa unamem abhaav tha
 It was not even in Sanskrit dictionaries
 kyonki ve aise chandobaddh shabdasangrah the jo paryaayon ke madhyam se ek yaa anek arthon kaa parichay dete the
 But in the commentary on the Amarkosh, the interpretation of Sanskrit created by the famous Sanskrit grammarian 'bhanuji Dixit', an attempt has been made to give a grammatical interpretation of all the words
 pashchim main aitihaasik or bhashavaigyanik anushilan kii drushti ne kosh ke aadhunik rup ko purna banane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 First of all, in Phillips' dictionary, the word syllable was only instructed in the context of etymology
 shabdhsagar ke tatsam or anek tadbhav shabdon kii vyutpatti isi rup main sanketit maatr he
 It is from here that etymological performance in English lexicons begins very commonly
 isse kuch pehle yaa isi ke aasapaas shabdarthbodh ke liye paryaay maatr dene ke sthaan par arthsuchak vyakhya likhane kii paddati aarambh ho gai thi
 Although there was an attempt to see the interpretations in the context of Martin's dictionary published only a year before Jansen, the etymological signal disappeared there
 jaannsaan ke kosh main naanaa arthchhayaon or udaahranon ke saath saath shabdaprayogk ke smritimulak udaarahan bhi die gaye
 In the indicative form, the etymological relation was used by the instruction of the original word
 samanarthak fonsisi paryaay bhi die gaye
 Sheridan and Walker's lexicon, though of lesser importance than Janson, were more careful in the direction of pronunciation
 webster ke kosh main chote paimaane par koshkala kii rachanavidhansambandhi purvamanyataon ke upyog kaa sarvaadhik prayaas hua
 On the other hand, in addition to the aforesaid features, the French Itali, Spanish-language novel with Latin in Dr
 Richardson's lexicon indicates that the lexicons of that era were growing in consciousness and developing comparative vision
 is anya kosh main tulanaatmak roopon kii pravriti to lupt ho gai par arthvyakhya main kuch kuch vishvakosiya paddati kaa prabhaav lakshith hone laga tha
 Again, the Latin, Italian, Spanish and French forms of the dictionary of Webster in the 1860s also give comparative impression, but this range of English dictionaries remained in the circle of these languages
 dhire-dhire koshkala ke adarsh rachana vidhaan kii upadan samagriyon kaa prayog— thodi yaa bahut maatra main — oxford english dictionari kii rachana ke pehle se bhi hone laga tha
 But their scientific and historical basis was not well established and well-organized
 ve upadan kisi ek koshon main yojanabaddh kram se sayojit na hokar bhinn bhinn kaashon main vikeern the
 Nevertheless, the usefulness of the essential products of the building was informed and directed
 purv koshon kii apeksha parvarti koshon main praayah arthpratipaadan kii purnataa, yatharthata or shuddhta ke saath- saath aitihaasik or bhaash vaigyanik praudhata babbti gai
 Dr
 Trench's Manisha lingered for proper appropriation and inclusion of all pre-symbolic products
 unhone suvyavasthit dhang se or yojanabaddh rup main unke upyog kii mahatta ko thik thik samajha or unke samuchit evam vyavasthit viniyog or prayog se koshrachana ke kaary ko purnataa kii disha main badhaane kaa prayaas kiya
 Keoladeo National Park or Keoladeo Ghana National Park is a famous bird sanctuary located in Rajasthan, India
 isko pehle bharatpur pakshi vihaar ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Thousands of rare and extinct species of birds are found in it, such as cranes from Siberia, which come here during the winter season
 yahan 230 prajati ke pakshiyon ne bharat ke rashtriya udyaan main apana ghar banaaya he
 It has now become a very large tourist destination and center, where ornithologists come in abundance in winter
 isko 1971 main sangrakshit pakshi abhayaarany ghoshit kiya gaya tha or baad main 1985 main ise 'vishwa dharohar' bhi ghoshit kiya gaya he
 This bird sanctuary was constructed 250 years ago and is named after the Keoladeo temple
 yah mandir isi pakshi vihaar main sthit he
 Due to natural slopes here, floods were often encountered
 bharatpur ke shaasha maharaj surajmal ne yahan ajaan band kaa nirmaan karavaaya, yah band do nadiyon gambheer or banganga ke sangam par banaaya gaya tha
 The park was a favorite hunting ground of the Maharajas of Bharatpur, who had a tradition dating back to 1850
 yahan par british vysarai ke sammaan main pakshiyon ke salanaa shikaar kaa aayojan hota tha
 In 1938, about 4,273 birds were hunted in just one day, birds like melord and teal were killed in abundance
 us samay ke bharat ke governor janaralalinalithgo the, jinane apane sahyogi victor hope ke saath inhen apana shikaar banaaya
 Even after India's independence, till 1972, the former king of Bharatpur was allowed to hunt in his area, but since 1982, fodder in the park was also banned which led to violent fighting between the farmers, Gurjar community and the government

 This step proved very frightening for the environment here

 The maximum known animal phyla appeared in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian eruption 542 million years ago
 shabd 'animal' latin bhashaa ke shabd animale, nauter of animalis, se aayaa he or anima se vyutpann hua he, jiskaa arth he jivit shwaas yaa aatma
 In common colloquial language, the term is used for non-human animals
 is shabd kii jaivik paribhaasha main maanav sahit kingdom animalya ke sabhi sadsy shaamil hai
 Animals have many special qualities that differentiate them from other living things
 jantu eukeriotic or bahu koshikeey hote hai,, jo unhen jeevanu va adhikansh protista se alag karte hai
 They are heterotrophic, usually digesting food in an inner chamber, which makes them distinct from plants and algae, they can also be differentiated from plants, algae and fungi because they lack a hard cell wall
 All animals are moving, even if they are in a particular phase of life
 adhiktam jantuon main, bhrun ek blastula avasthaa se hokar gujarata he, yah jantuon kaa ek vibhedak gun he
 With few exceptions, most notably sponges and placozoa, the bodies of animals differentiate into different tissues
 in main mansapeshiyaan shaamil hai, jo sankuchan tathaa gati ke niyantran main sakasham hoti hai or tantrika utak, jo sanket bhejtaa he va un par pratikriya karata he
 They also have a typical internal digestive chamber consisting of 1 or 2 holes
 jin jantuon main is prakaar kaa sanghathan hota he, unhen metazon kaha jaataa he, yaa tab eumetazon kaha jaataa he jab, purv kaa prayog saamaanya rup se jantuon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 All animals have eukaryotic cells, which are surrounded by extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoprotein
 yah khol, asthi or kantak jaisi sanranchanaaon ke nirmaan ke liye kelsikrut ho sakati hai
 During development, it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move and reorganize, creating possible complex structures
 iske vipareet, anya bahukoshikeey jeev jaise paudhe or kavak kii koshikaayen koshika bhitti se ghiri hoti hai or is prakaar se pragatisheel vruddhi dwaara viksit hoti hai
 In addition, animal cells have a unique property of intercellular joints: tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes
 lagbhag sabhi jantu kisi prakaar ke langik prajnan kii prakriya se hokar guzarate hai: poliploid
 These have some specialized reproductive cells that undergo meiosis to produce small motile spermatozoa or large sedentary eggs

 The zygote initially develops into a hollow sphere called blastula, it undergoes a process of rearrangement and differentiation of cells
 spanj main, blastula larva tair kar ek nae sthaan par chalaa jaataa he or ek nae spanj main viksit ho jaataa he
 In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complex rearrangements
 yah pehle antar valayit hokar ek gestrula banaata he, jisamen ek pachan kaksh or do alag janan str hote hai-ek bahari bahyatvak str or ek aantarik antah tvak str
 Prey is a biological interaction in which a predator receives food from its prey

 The selective pressure exerted on one another has led to an evolutionary race between prey and predator, resulting in many anti-predator adaptations
 zyaadaatar jantu apratyaksh rup se surya ke prakaash se hi urja praapt karte hai
 Plants use this energy to convert sunlight into simple sugars using a process called photosynthesis
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya carbon dioxide or jal ke saath shuru hoti he, isamen surya ke prakaash kii urja ko rasinic urja main badal diya jaataa he, jo glucose ke bandhon main sanchit ho jaati he, is prakriya ke dauraan oxigen bhi mukt hoti he
 Now this sugars are used as manufacturing units, which leads to plant growth

 The first fossils that represent animals appeared around the end of the Precambrian period, about 610 million years ago and are called the Ediacaran or Vendian biota
 lekin inhen baad ke jeevashm se sambandhit karnaa kathin hai kuch aadhunik sanghon ke purvavartiyon kaa pratinidhitiv kar sakate hai, lekin ve alag samooh ho sakate hai or yah bhi sambhav he ki ve vastav main jantu na hon
 Except for them, the most known animal phyla appeared automatically during the Cambrian era, 542 million years ago
 yah abhi bhi vivaadit he, ki yah ghatana jise cambrian visphot kaha jaataa he, bhinn samoohon ke bich teevr vichlan kaa pratinidhitiv karti he yaa paristhitiyon main un parivartanon kaa pratinidhitiv karti he jisane jeevashmeekaran ko sambhav banaaya
 Although some archaeologists and geologists suggest that animals appeared much earlier than previously thought, probably 1 billion years ago
 Fossil insignia such as trails and burrows found in the Tonian era indicate the presence of three-dimensional worms such as metazoa
 Likely earthworms would have been large and complex
 iske alaava lagbhag 1 billian varsh purv tonian yug kii shuruyaat main, stromatolait main kami aayi
 The diversity that currently informs the arrival of animals grazing as stromatolites increased diversity, shortly after the end of the Ordovician and Permian, causing large numbers of grazing marine animals to become extinct in their populations
 Shortly after the recovery, their number decreased
 vah khoj jo in praarambhik jeevashm chinhon ke bahut adhik saamaan he, unki utpatti aaj ke vishaal aakar ke ek koshikeey protista ke jeev gromia sferica ke dwaara hui he, is par praarambhik jantu ke vikaas ke pramaan ke rup main unki vyakhya par andeh he
 For a long time, sponges were considered different from other early animals
 jaisaa ki upar bataaya gaya he, anya adhikansh sanghon main paaya jane vaala jatil sanghathan inamen nahin paaya jaataa he, unki koshikaayen vibhedit hai, lekin adhikansh maamalon main alag alag utakon main sangathit nahin hai
 The sponges are stems and usually draw water through their pores to obtain food
 aarkiokaitha, jisamen sangalit kankal hota he, vah spanj kaa yaa ek alag sangh kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he
 However, a Fellow genomic study of 150 genes in 21 species in 2008 suggests that it is Tinophora or comb jelly that forms the basis of animals in at least 21 of those associations
 lekhak vishwaas rakhte hai ki spanj yaa kam se kam ve spanj jo unhone khoje hai- itane aadim nahin hai, lekin iske bajaay dwitiyak rup se sarlikrut kiye ja sakate hai
 In other phyla, Tinophora and Nideria, including sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish, are radially symmetric, having a digestive chamber with a single pore, which serves both the mouth and the anus
 donon main spasht vibhedit utak hote hai, lekin ye angon main sangathit nahin hote hai
 There are only two main germ levels, ectoderm and endoderm, between which only the cells are scattered
 isi liye in jantuon ko kabhi kabhi diploblactic kaha jaataa he
 Small placozoa are similar, but do not have a permanent digestive chamber
 shesh jantu ek sangheey samooh banaate hai jo bailetria kehalaata he
 For the maximum part, they are bilateral symmetric and often have a specialized head consisting of food organs and sensory organs
 sharir tripaloblastic hota he, arthath, teenon janan paraten purna viksit hoti hai or utak vibhedit ang banaate hai
 The digestive chamber has two holes, a mouth and an anus, as well as an internal body cavity which is also called a celome or virtual body cavity

 In addition to this, there are some small groups of bipartite asymmetrical organisms that appear to be diffusing to these main groups
 in main shaamil hai esolmorpha, rombojoa or orthonekatida
 Mixozoa, a unicellular parasite originally thought to be protozoan, are thought to have evolved from the Bilateria
 duterostome anya bailetria, protostome se kai prakaar se bhinn hai
 In both cases a complete digestive tract is found
 haalanki, protostome main praarambhik chhidr muh main viksit hota he or guda alag se viksit hoti he
 This is the reverse in deuterostomes
 adhikansh protostome main, koshikaayen saadhaaran rup se gestrula ke aantarik bhaag main bhar jaati hai or madhya janan str banaati hai, yah shaijosilas vikaas kehalaata he, lekin duterostome main yah antar janan str ke antervalan se banataa he, jise entrocelic pouching kaha jaataa he
 Deuterostomes have a dorsal nerve cord rather than a ventral and their embryos undergo a different cleavage
 yah sab vivaran bataata he ki duterostome or protostome alag ek sangheey str hai
 The major associations of deuterostomes are echinodermata and chordata
 pehle vaala trigyat samamit he or vishesh rup se samudri he, jaise tara machhlee, samudri archin or samudri khiraa
 The second one consists mainly of vertebrate organisms in which the spinal cord is found
 in main shaamil hai machhlee, ubhaychar, reptiles, pakshi or standhari
 Apart from these, deuterostomes also include Hemicordetta and Akon worms
 haalaanki ve vartmaan main mukhyatah nahin paae jate hai, mahatvapurn jeevashmi pramaan inase sambandh rakhte hai
 Chatognatha or arrow worms may also be deuterostomes, but more recent studies show their association with protostomes
 ekadsojoa protostome hai, jinka yah naam paritvakabhavan yaa nirmochan ke dwaara vruddhi ke vishesh lakshan ke aadhaar par diya gaya he
 The largest animal union, Arthropoda, belongs to them, including worms, spiders, crabs and their close relatives

 The remaining two groups of protostomes are sometimes placed along the spiral, as embryonic development occurs in both with spiral cleavage
 platizoa main shaamil he sangh platihelminthij, chapate krimi
 Originally they were thought to be the most primitive types of bipartite, but they are now thought to have evolved from more complex ancestors
 is samooh main kai paraseete shaamil hai, jaise fluke or feeta krimi
 Flatworms are angular, lacking a body cavity, as in their closest relative, the microbe Gastrotrica
 platizoa ke anya sangh zyaadaatar sookshm darsheey or abhaasi dehguha se yukt hote hai
 The most prominent are rotifera or rotifers, which are common in aquatic environments
 inamen aconthociphela yaa shalki-sheersh vaale krimi shaamil hai, gnethostomulida, micrognethojoa or sambhawatah sicleophora
 These groups have complex jaws, due to which they are called Gnathifera

 Lophotrochozoa also includes the Nemertia or Ribbon worm, Sipuncula, and several associations that have a fan of cilia around the mouth, called the lophophore
 inhen paaramparik rup se lopho forates ke saath samoohit kiya jaataa tha
 But now it appears that they are paraphyletic, some close to Nemertia and some close to Mollusca and Annelida
 inamen brekiopoda yaa lemp shell shaamil hai, jo jeevashm ricord main mukhya hai, ye hai antoneprokataa, foronida, ore sambhawatah bryojoa yaa mos jantu
 Due to the large diversity found in animals, it is more economical for scientists to study a small number of selected species, in order to correlate their work and findings on how animals normally function

 This was facilitated by the much more reduced state of their genome, but here the two-edged sword with multiple genes, introns, and linkage lost, organisms of Ecdysozoa can teach us a little bit about the origin of animals in general

 The Indus Valley Civilization is one of the major civilizations of the ancient river valley civilizations in the world
 jo mukhya rup se dakshin asia ke uttar-pashchimi kshetron main, jo aaj tak uttar purv afghanistan ,pakistan ke uttar-pashchim or uttar bharat main faili he
 Along with the ancient civilizations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of the three earliest chronologies of the civilizations of the ancient world, and of these three, the most widespread and most discussed
 sammanit patrika nechar main prakashit shodh ke anusaar yah sabhyataa kam se kam 8000 varsh puraani he
 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'
 iskaa vikaas sindhu or ghaghghar / hakadaa ke kinare hua
 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times
 7ve shatabdi main pehali baar jab logo ne punjab praant main ito ke liye mitti kii khudaai kii tab unhen vahaan se bani banaai ite mili jise logo ne bhagwaan kaa chamatkaar mana or unka upyog ghar banane main kiya uske baad1826 main charles mysen ne pehali baar is puraani sabhyataa ko khoja
 In 1856 Cunningham surveyed about this civilization
 1856 main karachi se lahore ke madhya railway line ke nirmaan ke dauraan bartan bandhuon dwaara hadappa sthal kii soochna sarkaar ko di
 In this sequence, in 1861, under the direction of Alexander Cunningham, the Archaeological Department of India was established
 1904 main lard karjan dwaara jon marshall ko bhartiya puratathvik vibhaag kaa mahanideshak banaaya gaya
 Fleet wrote an article about this old civilization
 1921 main dayaram saahani ne hadappa kaa utkhanan kiya
 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer
 yah sabhyataa sindhu nadi ghati main faili hui thi isliye iskaa naam sindhu ghati sabhyataa rakhaa gaya
 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization
 pratham baar kaansya ke prayog ke kaaran ise kaansya sabhyataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 1400 centers of Indus Valley Civilization have been discovered, of which 925 centers are in India
 80 pratishat sthal saraswati nadi or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke aas-paas he
 So far only 3 percent of the total discoveries have been excavated
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world
 is paripakv sabhyataa ke kendra-sthal punjab tathaa sindh main tha
 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction
 is prakaar hadappa samskruti ke antargat punjab, sindh or baluchistan ke bhaag hi nahin, balki gujarat, rajasthan, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke seemaant bhaag bhi the
 Its spread ranged from Rahmandheri in the north to Daimabad in the south and Sutkagandor of Makran beach in Balochistan in the west to Meerut and Kurukshetra in the northeast
 praarambhik vistaar jo praapt tha usamen sampoorn kshetra tribhujaakar tha is tarah yah kshetra aadhunik pakistan se to bada he hi, pracheen misr or mesopotamia se bhi bada he
 In the third and second millennium BC, the area of any civilization throughout the world was not larger than the Harappan culture
 ab tak bhartiya upmahadweep main is samskruti ke kul 1000sthalon kaa pataa chal chukaa he
 Some of these are in the initial stage, some are in the mature stage and some are in the later stage

 The specialty of these two is to be a city fortress
 uttar hadappa avasthaa gujarat ke kathiyawad prayadweep main rangpur or rosedi sthalon par bhi pai gai he
 Charles Mann first came to know of this civilization in 1826
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke pramukh shahar teen deshon main is prakaar he:- The various cities of India have the following cities of the Indus Valley Civilization: - is sabhyataa kii sabase vishesh baat thi yahaan kii viksit nagar nirmaan yojana
 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep
 dono siron par tal tak jane kii seedhiyaan lagi hai
 There are change rooms next to the clothes
 snanagar kaa farsh paki eenton kaa bana he
 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose
 hauz ke kone main ek nirgam he jisase pani bahakar naale main jaataa tha
 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India
 mohan jodado kii sabase bada sanrachana he - anaaj rakhane kaa kothaar, jo 45
71 meter lanbaa or 15
23 meter chaudaa he
 Six rooms have been found in the fort of Harappa, which stand in two rows on a platform of bricks
 har ek kothaar 15
23 me
 lanbaa tathaa 6
09 me
 chaudaa he or nadi ke kinare se kuch ek meter kii duuri par he
 The floor area of these twelve units is about 838
125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storehouse
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat
 banaavali main mila jau unnat kism kaa he
 Apart from this, they also produced sesame and mustard
 sabase pehle kapaas bhi yaheen paidaa kii gai
 In the name of this, the people of Greece started saying this sign

 Different types of paintings were made on pottery with black color
 kapadaa banane kaa vyavsaay unnat avasthaa main tha
 It was also exported abroad
 johari kaa kaam bhi unnat avasthaa main tha
 The work of making bead and amulets was also popular, yet no iron item has been found
 atah siddh hota he ki inhen lohe kaa gyaan nahin tha
 People here used to trade stones, metal scales etc
 among themselves
 ek bade bhubhag main dher sari sil, ekarup lipi or manakikrut maap taul ke pramaan mili hai

 They established a commercial colony in northern Afghanistan that facilitated trade
 bahut si harappai sil mesopotamia main mili hai jinase lagata he ki mesopotamia se bhi unka vyapaar sambandh tha
 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log apane shavon ko jalaayaa karte the, mohan jodado or hadappa jaise nagaron kii aabaadi kareeb 50 hazaar thi par phir bhi vahaan se keval 100 ke aasapaas hi kabre mili he jo is baat kii or ishaara karata he ve shav jalaate the
 Havan blunts have been found at Lothal, Kalibanga etc
, which is a proof of their being Vedic

 Some scholars believe that Hinduism was the original religion of Dravida and that Shiva was the god of Dravida whom the Aryans adopted
 kuch jain or buddha vidwaan yah bhi maanate he ki sindhu ghati sabhyataa jain yaa buddha dharm ke the, par mukhyadhara ke itihaaskaaron ne yah baat nakaar di or iske adhik pramaan bhi nahin he
 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship
 jaise aaj hindu ganga main nahaane jate he vaise hi saindhav log yahan nahaakar pavitra hua karte the

 eks-kiran yaa eks re ek prakaar kaa vidyut chumbakeey vikiran he jisaki tarangadairghy 10 se 0
01 nanometer hoti he
 It is most commonly used in medicine for diagnosis
 yah ek prakaar kaa inkaree vikiran he, isliye khatarnaak bhi he
 In many languages it is also known as Röntgen radiation, which is based on the name of its investigator Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen
 rontjan equalent maanav isaki shastreey maapak ikai he
 In 1895 X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Konrad Runtzen, a professor of physics at the University of Wurtzburg in Germany
 yadi kaanch kii nalika main se vaayu ko pump se kramash: nikaala jaae or usamen ucch vibhav kaa vidyudvisarjan kiya jaae, to daab ke paryaapt alp hone par vaayu swayan prakashit hone lagati he
 While conducting an experimental study of this phenomenon, Rantzen observed that when the air pressure was very low, the rays coming out of the sluice tube gave light to barium platinocyanide and, when the tube was completely covered with black paper Also, the manibh kept nearby keeps on shouting
 at: yah spasht tha ki visarjananalika ke baahar jo kirane aati hai ve kaale kaagaj main se sugamawa se paar ho sakati hai or barium platinosynide ke parade ko dhyutimaan karne kaa vishesh gun in kirnon main he
 Such rays were not yet known in science
 at: in nai avishkrut kirnon kaa naam 'eksrez' rakhaa gaya, kintu rantjan ke sammaan main, visheshat : germany main, in kirnon ko 'rantjan kirane' hi kaha jaataa he
 As soon as Rantzen's invention was published, the attention of the entire scientific world was attracted to X-ray
 apaardarshee thos padaartho main se paar hone kaa eksre kaa gundharm atyant mahatvapurn tha or is gundharm kaa upyog vigyaan ke anek vibhaagon main ho saktaa tha
 Therefore, efforts were made to produce X-rays and study their properties in many physics laboratories
 alp daab par vaayu main jo vidyut visarjan hota he, uske adhyayan kaa aadhunik bhautikee ke vikaas main ek vishesh sthaan he
 If by connecting a long glass tube with a vacuum pump, the inner air flows through a high voltage current, initially, when the pressure is high, no action is seen, but when the air pressure is reduced first Both are electronegative
 daab ko or kam karne par sampurna nalika dhyutimaan ho jaati he
 According to the interpretation of modern physics, the reason is that when electrons get energy and they move with the remaining air molecules while moving at high velocity towards the positive
 sanghaton ke kaaran anuon ke aayan banate hai or jab ye aayan purv avasthaa ko praapt hote hai tab prakaash kaa utsarjan hota he
 Due to the existence of ions, electrophoresis continues in the air
 daab ke atyant alp ho jane par electranon se sanghaat hone ke liye paryaapt anu nahin rahete; at: electron runagra se nikalakar apni sampurna urja se dhanagar se sidhe takaraate hai
 Due to these effects, the intense energy of electrons gets to the atoms of the cation and one result is the production of X-rays
 is paddati se eksre kaa utpaadan karne ke liye nalika main ek kranthik daab kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If the air pressure is higher than this critical pressure, then there is not enough energy in the electrons to produce the x-ray
 duusari ore, yadi daab is kranthik daab se kam ho to electron utpann hi nahin hote, at: vidyudvisarjan hi band ho jaataa he
 Initially the X-ray was produced using a similar type of aerial and the air pressure was kept at a critical value of this critical pressure
 eksre ke do vishesh gundharm adhik mahatvapurn hai : There are three main methods of intensity measurement
 pratideept parade par eksre se jo dipti aati he uski tivrata-maryaadit dipti tak-eksre kii tivrata kii samaanupati hoti he
 The intensity of the x-ray can be broadly compared by estimating the intensity of fluorescence
 duusari vidhi main photo pattica ke upar eksre kii jo kriya hoti he, uskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The blackness that comes from the X-ray incident on the photo plate depends on the intensity of the X-ray and the time of incidence
 is paddati se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii tulana karne ke liye adhik tivrata ke eksre punj se photo pattica par maryaadit sthaan par kisi upyukt kaal tak kriya hone di jaati he or tatpashchaat usee pattica par kuch neeche duusare eksre punj kii kriya kaal t, 2t, 3t aadi tak hone di jaati he
 After developing the plaque, comparing the blackness of the two pictures gives a sense of the relative intensity of the two arms
 tivrathamapan kii teesri reeti adhik prachlit he, kyonki is reeti se tivrata thik thik maapi ja sakati he
 When the x-ray passes through the air, the air becomes electronegative and its conductivity depends on the intensity of the x-ray
 eksre kii kriya se vaayu ke anuon ke electron visthapit hote hai or aayan utpann hote hai
 In the presence of proper electrodepolarization, the electrons that can be obtained from ions can be measured with a sensory electronometer, or with other appropriate sensory devices
 eksre kii tivrata vidyuddhara kii samaanupati hoti he
 More recently, the use of multiplier-illuminant and x-ray sensing spurs has made intensity measurements extremely accessible
 usee prakaar, gaigagunak kii sahaayta se ynikaran kii dhara kaa maapan bhi sugamawa se ho saktaa he
 Therefore, measurement of intensity of X-rays by both these types of devices is more prevalent in present day
 tivrathamapan kii in teenon prachlit ritiyon se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii keval tulana hi ho sakati he, nirpeksh tivrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 In fact, we can call the intensity of the X-ray as the energy exerted per second on an area of one square centimeter perpendicular to the x-ray
 is tivrata ko arg prati varg centimetre prati senkad main vyakt karte hai
 In order to measure intensity as energy, the energy of the X-ray is very low because in this way intensely specific instruments are required for intensification
 is reeti se tivrathamapan kaa pratham prayaas terril ne kiya tha
 Subsequently, in 1953, Henderson, BT and Laffan of the University of Illinois in the United States also tried
 ati prachand vidyudvibhav se utpann eksre kii tivrata keval isi reeti se naapi ja sakati he
 Experimental work of physics always requires units and has its shape according to the measured amount
 eksre kii maatra ke ekak ko 'rantjan' kehete hai or vartmaan kaal main ek rantjan kii paribhaasha nimnlikhit prakaar se kii jaati he- Another special feature of X-rays is their solubility
 bhinn bhinn thos pindon kii samaan motaayiyon main se paar hone par eksre kii tivrata main jo kami hoti he vah samaan nahin hoti
 The absorption of X-rays is higher in some solids and less in some substances
 prayog dwaara yah fal praapt hua ki kisi thos vishesh kii bhinn bhinn motaayiyon main se yadi eksre paar jaae, to nirgat eksre ko tivrata, praarambhik tivrata or thos padaarth kii motaai, in teenon main nimnlikhit sameekaran ke anusaar sambandh rahata he : log = - m × thickness --- yahan = eksre kii praarambhik tivrata; i = intensity of x-ray after crossing through solid material; m = ek sthiraank, jisko 'avasorana gunak' kehete hai
 This constant is called that solid's special x-ray-absorption-multiplier
 vastut: yah rekhiy gunak he
 To express it broadly, it is divided into the density of that solid substance and thus the absorption coefficient obtained is called 'code-absorption-factor'
 at: mmass = m / density sanhati-avasorana-gunak kaa vishesh mahatv yah he ki vah avasorak padaarth kaa lakshanik gundharm he
 For example, the linear absorption-multiplier of water and steam is different, because water is liquid and steam is gas
 parantu jal tathaa bhaap kaa eksre sanhati-avasorana-gunank samaan hi hota he, kyonki jal tathaa bhaap ke rasinic sanrachak abhinn hai arthath hydrogen tathaa oxijan
 The variation of the properties of light and x-rays is very clear from the code-absorption-multiplier
 saadhaarant: drav or thos padaarth prakaash ke liye swayan apaardarshee athwa parbhasak hote hai
 Diamond is transparent and graphite opaque to light, but the codon-absorption-coefficient of X-ray remains the same for diamond and graphite, as these two materials are essentially different forms of carbon
 eksre nalika se jo sampurna eksre praapt hote hai, un sabakaa avasorana-gunak mukhyat: vidyudvibhav or avasorak parade kii dhaatu kaa parmaanu-kramank, in donon par nirbhar rahata he
 As the voltage increases, the penetration or hardness of the x-ray produced increases
 sameekaran se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kisi ek thos padaarth ke liye avasorana gunak sab motaayiyon ke liye sthir rahegaa
 But in direct use, the low passable portion of radiation received from the x-ray tube is completely absorbed in the first levels of the absorber screen
 keval adhik praveshkshmata ke eksre avasorana parade ke antim staron tak pahunch pate hai
 It is clear that the absorption factor of the x-ray entering the absorption screen is higher than the absorption factor of the x-ray crossing the absorption screen
 jab samast eksre kaa avasorana gunak samaan hota he tab unako samang eksre kehete hai
 Thus the amount of X-rays is measured by their intensity and their characteristic by their absorption-multiplier
 jis padaarth se prakaash aata he us padaarth ko ham dekh sakate hai, kyonki prakaash kirnon kii ek kriya hamaari aankh ke roopaadhar par hoti he
 This type of action is not by X-ray, so X-rays are not visible
 itnaa hi nahin, aankhon par tathaa sharir ke anya angon par eksre kii kriya atyant hanikaarak hoti he
 Due to the action of X-rays on living cells for a sufficient period of time, they are reduced
 eksre sharir ke charm main se saralata se paar ho jate hai or bheetar ke jivit koshaaon par inaki paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se unke mrit ho jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Again, X-ray effects are durable; Therefore, X-ray activity continues at different places at the same place of the body, and in some periods, cancer-like refractory diseases occur
 at: eksre kaa upyog karte samay atyant saavdhaanee se kaary karne kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 Special tools are used to protect the body
 iske atirikt eksre kaa nity upyog karanevaale vartmaan kaal main ek eksre-maatra-maapi apni jeb main rakhte hai, jisase pataa chalata he ki vikiran kii kitni maatra karmchaaree ke upar kaary kar chuki he
 This lethal property of X-rays is also used in other diseases; For example, if harmful pathogens grow in any part of the body, they can be destroyed by using X-rays on them
 eksre kaa ayurvigyaan main, visheshat: shalyakarm main, adhik upyog hota he
 The possibility of this type of use was evident from the time of X-ray's invention
 sharir ke bhinn-bhinn avyavon ke avasorana-gunak vibhinn hote hai; at: sharir ke kisi bhi bhaag main se eksre paar karke photo lene se asthiyaan tathaa anya ghatak pruthak pruthak dikhaai dete hai 
 Therefore, X-ray photographs are very useful before surgery, or to find out what condition the disease is in
 eksre ke utpaadan main pragati hone par unka upyog udyogon main bhi hone laga or vartmaan kaal main dhaatuvigyaan main eksre kaa upyog aavashyak ho gaya he
 Energy is either combined with particles or combined with waves
 kisi udgam se urja kaa visarjan hota ho to is urja kaa astitv saadhaarant: vidyucchambukiy tarangon kii tivrata main, athwa electron, proton, neutron, aayan ityadi kanon kii gatij urja ke rup main, vyakt hota he
 The patterns of wave and particle are different; Therefore, they are usually kept in different categories
 kintu anek prayogon ke falon se yah spasht ho gaya he ki in virgon kaa bandhan tarangon main kanon ke gun hai or, vilomat: kanon main bhi tarangon ke gun hai
 This duality form began with the principle of the heat of the Planck
 eksre ke gun bhi is dwait rup ke apwaad nahin hai
 X-rays have certain properties of waves and certain properties are also of particles
 pehle ham tarangeey gunon par vichaar karenge
 From the fruits of early experiments, it was clear that X-rays and light have properties comparable
 eksre tathaa prakaash kii kirnon kaa dik main saral rekhaon main prachaaran hota he
 Like light, the intensity of an x-ray is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance
 photo pattica par honevaali kriya tathaa gas main kiye gaye ynikaran ke gunon main bhi donon main samya he
 In 1905 AD, by experiment, Marx proved that the velocity of the x-ray is the same as the velocity of light — that is, 3 × 10 ° cm per second
 vaidyut tathaa chumbakeey kshetron main eksre aprabhavit rahete hai
 It was clear from all these properties that X-rays are electromagnetic in nature, not light charged particles
 bhed keval tarangadairghyo main ho saktaa he
 From the experiments of scientists such as Haga, Windt, Walters, Pol, Sommerfeld, etc
, it could be inferred that the wavelength of the x-ray was 1 × 10–8 cm
 Is near kintu pratham nirnayaatmak fal lave, freederish tathaa kniping ke prayogon se praapt hua or eksre kii tarangadairghy pramanit hui
 After this experiment, several attempts were made to clarify the wavelength of the X-ray and to obtain experimental results of other results in relation to it and to obtain experimental results of other dimensions with respect to it
 eksre kaa tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghy se bahut kam hone ke kaaran jin prayogon dwaara prakaash kaa tarangadairghy saralata se mapa ja saktaa he, vaise prayog eksre ke liye karne main anek kathinaaiyaan upasthit hoti hai
 However, in the present times, experiments like X-ray interference, diffraction, polarization, etc
 have been successful, and the wavelengths of the X-rays have been known to be as high as the optical waves
 jin prayogon se eksre kii tarangaprakruti pramanit hoti he unamem se kuch neeche die ja rahe hai- X-rays are particularly helpful in finding the crystalline structure
 chikitsiya upyogon ke alaava bhi eksre kaa anekon prakaar se upyog kiya jaataa he
 Due to the unique properties of X-rays, they are widely used in many branches of science and in various industries
 udyogon main, visheshat: nirmaan tathaa nirmit padaartho ke gunon ke niyantran main, eksre kaa bahut upyog hota he
 Intrinsic errors of manufactured materials can be easily detected by X-ray photographs
 vimaan tathaa usee prakaar ke sadhano ke yantron main ati teevr veg tathaa charam bhautik paristhitiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa hai; aise yantron ke nirmaan main prayek avyav antarbahya nirdosh tathaa yatharth hona chahie
 Each such component is tested with an X-ray and the defective components are discarded
 dhaatu eksre kaa avasorana karte hai, at: dhaatuon ke antarbhaagon kii pariksha ke liye mridu eksre anupyukt hote hai
 Extremely high-voltage X-rays are required for large-sized metallic materials
 dhaatu vigyaan tathaa dhatugaveshna main eksre atyant upyogi hai
 Metals are also crystalline, but their crystals are fine and they are set up in the desired way, so the lave-statue of metals usually has a concentric circle
 prayek vartual ek samaan tivrata kaa hota he, kintu kisi bhautik kriya se kanon ke aakaaron main vruddhi ho jane par in vartualon main bindu bhi aate hai
 Therefore, by X-ray interference, it is known exactly what the particles of metallic particles are and how their shape is like
 is gyaan kaa dhaatuvigyaan main atyant mahatv he
 At the time of making metal materials, heat causes them to become insoluble
 dhaatu ko modane se bhi usamen antarvikruti ho jaati he
 Such distortions can be analyzed by X-ray
 is prakaar vishisht gunon se yukt nirdosh dhaatu praapt karne main eksre kaa vishesh upyog hota he
 Among other uses of X-rays, the X-ray microscope is notable
 eksre ke tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghyo se sookshm hote hai, at: eksre sookshmdarshi ko prakaash sookshmdarshi se adhik prabhaavshaalee hona chahie
 In 1948, Kirkpatrick's efforts to focus X-rays were partially successful
 is reeti se tathaa anya ritiyon se pratibimb kaa aavardhan karne ke praytn ab praayogic avasthaa paar kar chuke hai or anek nirmaataaon dwaara nirmit kai prakaar ke eksre sookshmdarshi sulabh hai
 Things that cannot be detected with light microscope are easily understood by X-ray microscope

 unhen saidhantik bhautikee, khaskar prakaash-vidyut ootsarjan kii khoj ke liye 1921 main nobel puraskaar pradaan kiya gaya
 Einstein made many contributions, including the theory of general relativity and general relativity

 According to a survey, he was considered the greatest scientist of all time
 oinstin ne 300 se adhik vaigyanik shodh-patron kaa prakaashan kiya
 On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the display of over 30,000 unique documents and papers from Einstein
 oinstin ke bauddhik uplabdhiyon or apurvata ne "oinstin" shabd ko "budhimaan" kaa paryaay bana diya he
 Albert Einstein was born in Germany into a Jewish family in Wüttemberg
 unke pita ek ejeeniyar or celsman the
