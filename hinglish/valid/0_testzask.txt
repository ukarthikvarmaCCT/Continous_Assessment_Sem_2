 isamen mahatvapurn baat ye he ki krypto-chrishchiyan koi gaali yaa nakaaratmak shabd nahin hai
 crypto-christianity is an institutional practice of Christianity
 krypto-chrischiyanity ke mul siddhant ke anrtgat chrishchiyan jis desh me rahate he vahaan ve dikhaave ke taur par to us desh ke ishwar kii puja karte hai, vahaan kaa dharm maanatein hai jo ki unka chhadmaavaran hota he; par vastav main andar se ve isai hote hai or nirantar isai dharm kaa prachaar karte rahate he
 The earliest example of crypto-christianity is found in Roman society when Christianity set its feet in Rome in the early days
 tatkaal mahaan roman samraat trojan ne isaiyat ko roman samskruti ke liye khatra samajha or jitne roman isai bane the unke saamne prastaav rakhaa ki yaa to ve isaiyat choden yaa mrityu-dand bhugten
 Roman Christians pretended to abandon Christianity to avoid capital punishment and then continued to worship Roman goddesses from above, but believed Christianity from within
 jis tarah musalmaan 5-10 pratishat hote hai hoten he tab us desh ke kanoon ko manaate hai

 Hollywood's famous film Agora ** is a must see for every Hindu
 isamen dikhaaya he ki jab krypto chrishchiyan rome main sankhya main adhik hue tab unhone roman devi-devataaon kaa apmaan karnaa shuru kar diya
 Presently in India too, crypto-christians started to catch hold, here too, started the act of abusing Hindu deities and Brahmins

 Many Christians pretended to return home to Buddhism and remain crypto-christians
 japan main in krypto-chrishchiyan ko “kakure-chrishchiyan***” kaha gaya
 kakure-christian stopped keeping any books related to Christianity for fear of Buddhists

 These Christian prayers began to be verbally transferred from one generation to another by the kakure-christians
 1550 se le kar agle 400 saalon tak kakure-chrishchiyan buddha dharm ke chhadmaavaran main rahe
 In the 20th century, when Japan moved towards industrialization and the religious fundamentalism of Buddhists declined, these kakure-christian Buddhists came out of the facade to reveal their Christian identity
 krypto chrishchiyanbuddha ke jaisi dikhne vaali murti, jo vastav main madar mairi kii he, ise japan ke krypto-chrishchiyan puujate the
 Not only in the Roman Empire and Japan are examples of crypto-christians found, but India also has an abundance of crypto-christians including the Balas and Asia Minor, Middle East, Soviet Russia, China, Nazi Germany
 jaise japan ke krypto chrishchiyan kakure kehalaate hai vaise hi asia miner ke deshon srbija main drovartaswo, cyprus main patsaloi, albania main laramnoi, lebanon main krypto maronite va egypt main krypto copts kehalaate hai
