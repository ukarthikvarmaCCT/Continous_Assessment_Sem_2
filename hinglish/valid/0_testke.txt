 Sir Isaac Newton was a scientist from England
 jinhone gurutvkarshan kaa niyam or gati ke siddhant kii khoj kii
 He was a great mathematician, physicist, astrologer and philosopher
 inkaa shodh prapatr "prakritik darshan ke ganitiya siddhanton "" san 1687 main prakashit hua, jisamen saarvatrik gurtvakarshan evam gati ke niyamon kii vyakhya kii gai thi or is prakaar chirsmmat bhautikee kii neenv rakhi
 His Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is itself the most influential book in the history of science, laying the groundwork for most literary mechanics
 is kaary main, newton ne saarvatrik gurutv or gati ke teen niyamon kaa varnan kiya jisane agali teen shatabdiyon ke liye bhautik brahmad ke vaigyanik drushtikon par apana varchasv sthapit kar liya
 Newton demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and the movement of celestial bodies are controlled by a set of natural laws, to show that he established a continuum between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, thus Overcome past doubts about sun centrality and the modernization of the scientific revolution
 yantriki main, newton ne samveg tathaa koniya samveg donon ke sangrakshan ke siddhanton ko sthapit kiya
 In optics, he created the first practical reflective telescope and developed the theory of color on the basis that a prism decomposes white light into the many colors that make up the visible spectrum
 unhone shitalan kaa niyam diya or dhwani kii gati kaa adhyayan kiya
 In mathematics, Newton credits Gottfried Leibniz with the development of the differential and integral calculus
 unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa bhi pradarshan kiya or ek falan ke shunyon ke sanniktan ke liye tathakthith "newton kii vidhi" kaa vikaas kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa ke adhyayan main yogadan diya
 Newton's position among scientists is at the very top, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of scientists at the Royal Society of Britain, which asked whether the impact on the history of science is more profound, Newton's or Albert Einstein's Of is surveykshan main newton ko adhik prabhavi paaya gaya
 
 Newton was also highly religious, although he was an unorthodox Christian, writing more on biblical hermeneutics than the natural sciences for which he is remembered today
 ijac newton kaa janm 4 janvari 1643 ko puraani style or nai style kii tithiyaan |OS]]: 25 disambar 1642]linkolanshir ke county main ek hemelet, woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth main woolsthrope menor main hua
 At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted a Grigorian calendar and so the date of his birth was recorded as Christmas Day 25 December 1642
 newton kaa janm unke pita kii mrityu ke teen maah baad hua, ve ek samrudh kisaan the unka naam bhi ijac newton tha
 He was a small child born in a pre-mature state; His mother Hannah Ayscuff said that he could fit a small mug like a quart
 jab newton teen varsh ke the, unki maa ne dubaara shaadi kar lee or apane nae pati reverand barnabus smith ke saath rahane chali gai or apane putr ko uski nani margeri askf kii dekhbhaal main chod diya
chota ijac apane sautele pita ko pasand nahin karata tha or uske saath shaadi karne ke kaaran apni maa ke saath dushmani kaa bhav rakhata tha
 As reflected in the list of crimes committed by him until he was 19 years old: "I threatened to burn the house of mother and father Smith
" baarah varsh se satraa varsh kii aayu tak unhone di kings skool, grantham main shiksha praapt kii unhen skool se nikaal diya gaya or oktober 1659 ve woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth aa gaye, jahaan unki maan, jo duusari baar vidhwaa ho chuki thi, ne unhen kisaan banane par jor diya
 He hated farming
 kings skool ke master henry stokes ne unki maa se kaha ki ve unhen phir se skool bhej den taaki ve apni shiksha ko puraa kar saken
 Inspired by his desire for revenge against a schoolboy, he became a top-ranked student
 june 1661 main, unhen trinity college, cambridge main ek sijar-ek prakaar kii kaary-adhyayan bhoomika, ke rup main bhartee kiya gaya
 The teachings of the college at that time were based on Aristotle
 lekin newton adhik aadhunik darshanikon jaise descartes or khagolavidon jaise kopernicus, galileo or kepler ke vichaaron ko padhnaa chahta tha
 In 1665 he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory later known as the Altaipal calculus
 agast 1665 main jaise hi newton ne apni degree praapt kii, uske thik baad plig kii bheeshan mahamari se bachane ke liye ehtiyaat ke rup main vishvavidhyalay ko band kar diya
yadhyapi ve ek cambridge vidhyaarthee ke rup main pratishthit nahin the, iske baad ke do varshon tak unhone woolsthorpe main apane ghar par nijee adhyayan kiya or kalan, prakaashiki or gurutvkarshan ke niyamon par apane siddhanton kaa vikaas kiya
 In 1667 he returned to Cambridge as a Fellow of Trinity
 adhikansh aadhunik itihaaskaaron kaa maananaa he ki newton or libanij ne atyalp kalan kaa vikaas apane apane adwitiya sanketanon kaa upyog karte hue swatantra rup se kiya
 According to Newton's inner circle, Newton developed his method many years before Leibniz, but he did not publish any of his works until about 1693 and did not give a complete account of his work until 1704
 Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684
 In addition, Leibniz's notations and "methods of differentiation" were universally adopted on the continent and, after 1820, were also adopted in the British Empire
 jabaki libanij kii pustikaayen praarambhik avasthaaon se paripakvata tak vichaaron ke aadhunikeekaran ko darshaati hai, newton ke gyaat nots main keval antim parinaam hi he
 Newton said that he did not want to publish his calculus because he was afraid he would become a character of ridicule
 newton kaa swiss ganitagya nicholas fatiyo de duiliar ke saath bahut kareebi rishta tha, jo prarambh se hi newton ke gurutvkarshan ke siddhant se bahut prabhavit the
 In 1691 Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica, but never completed it
 However, the relationship between these two men changed in 1693
 is samay, duiliar ne bhi libanij ke saath kai patron kaa aadan pradaan kiya tha
 In early 1699, other members of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the controversy was fully revealed in 1711
 newton kii royal socity ne ek adhyayan dwaara ghoshnaa kii ki newton hi sachche avishkaarak the or libanij ne dhokhadhadi kii thi
 The study came under suspicion when it was later found that Newton himself wrote commentary on the study's conclusion on Leibniz
 is prakaar kadava newton banaam libanij vivaad shuru ho gaya, jo baad main newton or libanij donon ke jivan main 1716 main libanij kii mrityu tak jari rahaa
 Newton is generally credited with the generalized binomial theorem, which is valid for any power
 unhone newton kii sarvasamikaon, newton kii vidhi, vargeekrut ghan samtal vakr kii khoj kii, parimit antaron ke siddhant main mahatvapurn yogadan diya, ve pehle vyakti the jinhone bhinnaatmak suchakank kaa prayog kiya or diophentin samikarnon ke hal ko vyutpann karne ke liye nirdeshaank jyamiti kaa upyog kiya
 He approximated the partial sum of the harmonic series by logarithms, and was the first to use the power series with confidence and the power of the power series
 unhen 1669 main ganit kaa leukesian professor chunaa gaya
 In those days, any member of Cambridge or Oxford was required to be a designated English priest
 haalaanki, leukesian professor ke liye jaruri tha ki vah carch main sakriy na ho
 Newton argued that he should be exempt from the need for coordination, and Charles II, whose permission was mandatory, accepted this argument
 is prakaar se newton ke dharmik vichaaron or angreji rudhiwaadiyon ke bich sangharsh tal gaya
 From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics
 During this period he discovered refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism dissects white light into a spectrum of colors, and a lens and a second prism combine white spectrum to form white light
 unhone yah bhi dikhaaya ki rangeen prakaash ko alag karne or bhinn vastuon par chamakaane se ragin prakaash ke gunon main koi parivartan nahin aata he
 Newton described that whether it is reflected, or radiated or transmitted, it remains of the same color
 is prakaar se, unhone dekha ki, rang pehle se rangeen prakaash ke saath vastu kii antarkriya kaa parinaam hota he naaki vasteen khud rangon ko utpann karti hai
 This is known as Newton's color theory
 is kaary se unhone nishkarsh nikaala ki, kisi bhi apvarti doordarshee kaa lens prakaash ke rangon main visaran kaa anubhav karegaa or is avadharana ko siddh karne ke liye unhone abhidrishyak ke rup main ek darpan kaa upyog karte hue, ek doordarshee kaa nirmaan kiya, taaki is samasya ko hal kiya ja sake
 darasal dizin ke nirmaan ke anusaar, pehla gyaat kriyaatmak paravarti doordarshee, aaj ek neutonian doorabeen ke rup main janaa jaataa he, isamen takanic ko aakaar dena tathaa ek upyukt darpan padaarth kii samasya ko hal karnaa shaamil he
 Newton based his mirror on a custom outfit of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to test the quality of optics for his telescope
 farvari 1669 tak ve rangeen vipathan ke bina ek upkaran kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham ho gaye
 In 1671 the Royal Society asked him to demonstrate his reflecting telescope
 un logon kii ruchi ne unhen apni tippaniyon on color ke prakaashan hetu protsaahit kiya, jise baad main unhone apni optics ke rup main vistrut kar diya
 When Robert Hooke criticized some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he dropped out of public debate
 hook kii mrityu tak donon dushman bane rahe
 Newton argued that light is made up of particles or superfluous particles, which refract as they pass through the dense medium, but it was necessary to correlate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light
 
 baad main bhautikavidon ne prakaash ke vivartan ke liye shuddh tarang jaise spashtikaran kaa samarthan kiya
 Today's quantum mechanics, the idea of photons and wave-particle coupling, bear little resemblance to Newton's understanding of light
 1675 kii unki prakaash kii pariklpana main newton ne kanon ke bich bal ke sthaanantaran hetu, ether kii upasthiti ko manjuur kiya
 His interest in alchemy revived after coming into contact with the theologian Henry More
 unhone ether ko kanon ke bich aakarshan or pratikarshan ke vayuruddh vichaaron par aadhaarit gupt balon se pratisthapit kar diya
 jon menard kenez, jinhone rasayan vidya par newton ke kai lekhon ko sweekaar kiya, kehete hai ki "newton kaaran ke yug ke pehle vyakti nahin the: ve jaaduugaron main aakhri number par the
 "newton's interest in alchemy cannot be distinguished from his contributions to science
 yadi unhone ek nirvaat main se hokar ek duuri par kriya ke gupt vichaar par bharosa nahin kiya hota to ve gurutv kaa apana siddhant viksit nahin kar pate
 In 1704 Newton published Optics, in which he explained in detail his theory of microscopic particles of light
 He considered light to be made up of very fine particles, whereas ordinary matter is made up of large particles and he said that a Through the type of chemical conversion "gross bodies and light cannot transform into each other, xxrep 7 
 and bodies from particles of light Can't get the most of their activity, who enters their organization? " Newton created a prototype form of a frictionless electrostatic generator, using a glass globe
 1677 main, newton ne phir se yantriki par apana kaary shuru kiya, arthath, gurutvkarshan or grahiy gati ke kepler ke niyamon ke sandarbh ke saath, grahon kii kaksha par gurutvkarshan kaa prabhaav or is vishay par hook or flemustid kaa paraamarsh
 He published his results at the De Motu Corporum in Jiram
 isamen gati ke niyamon kii shuruyaat thi jisane princepia ko suchit kiya
 The Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica was published on 5 July 1687 with the financial help and encouragement of Edmund Healy
 is kaary main newton ne gati ke teen saarvbhaumik niyam die jinamein 200 se bhi adhik varshon tak koi sudhaar nahin kiya gaya he
 He used the Latin word gravitas to that effect known as gravitation and defined the law of universal gravitation
 isi kaary main unhone vaayu main dhwani kii gati ke, boil ke niyam par aadhaarit pehle vishleshatmak pramaan ko prastut kiya
 He was criticized for Newton's concept of an invisible force that could operate over vast distances, as he merged "secret agencies" into science
 princepia ke saath, newton ko antarrashtriya khyaati mili
 unhen kaaphi prashansaaen milin, unke ek prashansak the, switzraland main janme nicholas fatiyo de dayulir, jinke saath unka ek gaharaa rishta ban gaya, jo 1693 main tab samaapt hua jab newton tantrika avrodh se peedit ho gaye

 unhone england kaa pramukh mudra dhallaai kaa kaary sambhaal liya, kisi tarah master lucas ke ishaaron par naachne lage Lucan's death in 1699 became Newton perhaps the best-known master of the mint, a position Newton held until his death
 These appointments were taken as an irresponsible position, but Newton took him seriously, from his Cambridge duties in 1701 Retired and tried to improve the currency and punished the clippings and fake currency makers using their power
 1717 main taksaal ke master ke rup main "laa of queen ene" main newton ne anjaane main sone ke paksh main chaandi ke paise or sone ke sikke ke bich dwi dhatvik sambandh sthapit karte hue, pound sterling ko chaandi ke maanak se sone ke maanak main badal diya
 For this reason silver sterling coins were melted and shipped out of Britain
 newton ko 1703 main royal socity kaa adhyaksh or french acadmic des sciensej kaa ek sahyogi bana diya gaya
 While in his position in the Royal Society, Newton turned hostile to the astronomer John Flemsteed, he prematurely published Flemsteed's Historica Colestis Britannica, which Newton had used in his studies
 april 1705 main queen eni ne newton ko trinity college, cambridge main ek shahi yatra ke dauraan nite kii oopaadhi di
 This knight's title was not conferred upon Newton for his services as master of the mint nor for his scientific work, but for his political contributions during the parliamentary election in May 1705

 In his own lifetime, Newton wrote about religion more than natural science
 He believed in the rational world, but rejected the hylozoism inherent in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza
 Thus, ordered and dynamically informed cosmologies Was understandable and should be understood by an active cause
 In his correspondence, Newton claimed that Prine Time "writes Sipia i had an eye upon such principles, in order to be considered faith in God and man
" He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: such wonderful uniformity in the planetary system should be allowed the effect of choice

 The attacks against pre-enlightenment "magical thinking," and the mystical elements of Christianity, found their foundation in Boyle's mechanical conception of the universe
 Newton perfected Boyle's ideas through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, he was very successful in popularizing them
 Newton transformed an interventionist God-controlled world into a world artistically created by God with rational and universal principles

 According to Newton's third law, every action has an equal and opposite reaction
 iskaa arth yah he ki jab bhi ek vastu kisi duusari vastu par ek bal lagaati he tab duusari vastu vipareet disha main pehali vastu par utana hi bal lagati he
 a common example of this is two ice skates move opposite to each other and then slide in opposite directions

 Since the objects in question do not necessarily have the same mass, the resulting acceleration of the two objects may be different

 For example, the second law also applies to planets and a falling stone

 Before Newton, it was generally believed that for a planet rotating around the Sun, a forward force was required which caused it to move

 Even several decades after the publication of the Principia, this idea was not universally accepted

 Newton himself often told a story that upon seeing a falling apple from a tree, he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravity
 baad main vyangy karne ke liye aise cartoon banaaye gaye jinamein seb ko newton ke sar par girte hue bataaya gaya or yah darshaya gaya ki isi ke prabhaav ne kisi tarah se newton ko gurutv ke bal se parichit karaayaa
 unki pustikaon se gyaat hua ki 1660 ke antim samay main newton kaa yah vichaar tha ki sthaliy gurutv kaa vistaar hota he, yah chandramaa ke varg vyutkramanupati hota he; haalaanki purna siddhant ko viksit karne main unhen do dashak kaa samay laga
 John Kanaduyt, who was Newton's associate at the Royal Mint and also the husband of Newton's niece, described the incident when he wrote about Newton's life: 1666 main ve cambridge se phir se sevanivrutt ho gaye or apni maa ke paas linkanshair chale gaye
 As he was walking in a garden, he got an idea that the power of gravity is not limited to a certain distance from the earth, but this power can extend far beyond what was previously thought
 unhone apane aap se kaha ki kya aisa utana upar bhi hoga jitna upar chaand he or yadi aisa he to, yah uski gati ko prabhavit karegaa or sambhavatya use uski kaksha main banaaye rakhega, ve jo gananaa kar rahe the, is tark kaa kya prabhaav hua
 The question was not about the existence of gravity, but whether this force is so wide that it is responsible for keeping the moon in its orbit
 newton ne darshaya ki yadi bal duuri ke varg vyutkram main kam hota he to, chandramaa kii kakshiya avadhi kii gananaa kii ja sakati he or acha parinaam praapt ho saktaa he
 He speculated that this force is responsible for other orbital motion and hence gave it the name of universal gravitation
 ek samakaleen lekhak, wiliam stukele, sar ijac newton kii zindagi ko apane samaran main ricord karte hai, ve 15 april 1726 ko kencinghton main newton ke saath hui baatcheet ko yaad karte hai, jab newton ne zikr kiya ki "unke dimag main gurutv kaa vichaar pehle kab aayaa
 This happened because of an apple falling while he was sitting in meditation posture
 kyon yah seb hameshaa bhoomi ke saapeksh lambavat main hi kyon girtaa he? aisa unhone apane aap main sochaa
 Why it does not move to the side or up, but always falls towards the center of the earth

 The various trees are claimed to be "that" apple tree which Newton has described
 di kings skool, grantham daawa karata he ki yah ped skool ke dwaara kharid liya gaya tha, kuch saalon baad ise jad sahit laakar pradhanadhyaapak ke bageeche main laga diya gaya
 The current staff at the National Trust, which owns Woolstrop Manor, disputs this, and claims that the tree is present in their garden about which Newton talked

 Like other forms of energy, heat also flows

 According to this, heat is also a form of energy
 at: iskaa roopantaran to ho saktaa he, kintu uski maatra main parivartan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Joule etc
 proved through experiments that the conversion of these two types of energy has a caloric heat equivalent to 4
18 and 107 erg mechanical energy
 The main purpose of engineers is to convert the heat into mechanical energy and run the engine
 pratham niyam yah to bataata he ki donon prakaar kii urjaayen vastav main abhinn hai, kintu yah nahin bataata ki ek kaa duusare main parivartan kiya ja saktaa he athwa nahin
 If the change of mechanical energy without intermittent heat could be possible, we could run a ship with heat from the sea

 Only the remaining part can be used in mechanical work
 samudr ke pani sa ooshmaa lekar usase jahaaj chalaanaa isaliye sambhav nahin ki vahaan par sarvatra samaan taap he or koi bhi nimna tapiya vastu maujuud nahin
 This rule has great importance

 saanchaa:infobox Laboratory equipment An autoclave is an instrument that sterilizes devices and materials based on their loads and contents, especially for 15 to 20 minutes, subjected to a high pressure vapor of 121 ° c or more
 1879 main charles chemberland dwaara iskaa avishkaar kiya gaya, jabaki steam dijester naamak iske purogami ko denis paapin ne 1679 main banaaya tha
 Its name originates from the French word aut and the Latin word clavis meaning key - a self-blocking device
 aatoklav do mukhya prakaar ke hai: Autoclaves are widely used in microbiology, medicine, tattooing, body piercing, veterinary science, fungi, dentistry, podiatry, and prosthetic manufacturing
 vishisht bhaar main shaamil hai kaanch ke bane bartan, chikitsa apshisht, bartan, animal kej beding or lisojani broth
 Autoclaves are a significantly increasing application in treatment and waste disposal such as occupational hospital waste
 is shrenee main mashine bade paimaane par asli aatoklav ke siddhanton par hi sanchalit hoti hai, jisamen ve dabaav yukt vaashp or atitapit jal ke upyog se sambhavit sankramak agenton ko beasar karne main sakasham hoti hai
 a new generation of waste changers is able to achieve the same effect without pressure vessels from which they sterilize culture media, rubber materials, gowns, dressing gloves, etc
 yah visheshkar un vastuon ke liye adhik upyogi he jo garm hawa ke avan ke ucch taapmaana ko sahan nahin kar sakate
 sabhi glass sirinjon ke liye, garm hawa avan ek behatar nishkiton vidhi he
 It is more important to ensure that the trapped air is completely removed, because hot air is too weak to achieve sterility
 jis keetanu-rahit hone kii sthiti ko hasil karne main 160 °C par garm hawa ko do ghanton kaa samay lagata he, use 134 °C par vaashp 3 minute main praapt kar leti he
 Air removal methods include: adho visthaapan - chunki bhaap hawa kii tulana main kam ghanatv vaali hoti he, kaksh main pravesh karte hi vaashp upree kshetron main bhar jaati he
 It presses the air downward and expels it from the exhaust
 praayah nikaas main ek taapmaana samvedan yantra rakhaa jaataa he
 When the air drainage is complete, only then the flow stops
 pravaah ko aam taur par ek solenoid valve yaa bhaap trep ke upyog dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he, lekin kabhi-kabhi blide chhidron kaa, aksar solenoid valve ke sangyojan sahit istemaal kiya jaataa he
 When air and steam are mixed, it is possible to remove the mixture from the bottom of the chamber as well as from other places
 vaashp spand - vaashp spandon kii shrinkhalaa kaa upyog karte hue vaayu tanukaran kiya jaataa he, jisamen vayumandaleey dabaav ke aas-paas pahunchane ke liye kaksh ko baari-baari se dabaav yukt or dabaav rahit kiya jaataa he

 kuch kaagaz yaa anya utpaada bhi, jo vaashp dwaara nasht ho sakati hai, anya upaay dwaara hi nishkitit kiye jate hai
 In all autoclaves, the items should always be separated, so that steam can enter the laden items evenly
 aatoklav pranali kaa upyog aksar nagar nigam ke maanak thos apshisht dhara main milaane se pehle chikitsa apshisht ko nishkitit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The application has emerged as an alternative to incineration due to environmental and health concerns arising from incineration of incinerators, especially small units commonly operated from individual hospitals
 bhasmeekaran yaa uske samaan ooshmiya oxikaran prakriya abhi bhi aam taur par roganidan sambandhi apshisht or anya bahut vishakt or / yaa sankramak chikitsa apshisht ke liye anivaary hoti he
 Autoclaves contain physical, chemical, and biological indicators that are used to ensure that the autoclave has reached the right temperature, at the right time
 rasinic sanketak chikitsa packaging or aatoklav tepe main dekhe ja sakate hai or ek baar sahi sthiti tak pahunch jane par inkaa rang badal jaataa he
 This color change indicates that the item inside the package or under the tape has been processed
 jaivik sanketakon main taap-pratirodhi jeevanu, jeeobasilas sterothermophilas maujuud hote hai
 If the autoclave does not reach the correct temperature, then bacteria begin to grow upon incubation and their metabolism changes the color of the ph-sensitive chemical
 kuch bhautik sanketakon main ek mishra dhaatu hota he jo sambhddha dharaniya samay se guzarane par pighalane ke liye dizine kiya hua hota he
 If the alloy melts, the change will be visible

 Stalman felt that in this way the computer software would be left with a few special people and there would be no complete development
 isaliye unhone apana institute ko chhod kar ghanu project, free sours foundation ke antargat shuru kiya
 In this, we started writing software that are copylefted
 unhone is tarah ke saftware ko free-sauftware kaa naam diya
 This is because, according to them, people have the freedom to modify computer programs or software, they say that do not think of free as in free beer but look like it is in freedom of speech
 free sours foundation kii websit ke mutabik, unhi ke shabdon main 'free software' is a matter of liberty, not price
 To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech', not as in 'free beer' The following are the main things in free or copied software - Source code is always published in this, there is no money or royalty to be paid for such software, but if you are giving any service in relation to it, then take the money to provide the service

 vartmaan samayon main jalpot vikhandan kaa kaary mukhya rup se bharat, china, pakistan or bangladesh main ho rahaa he
 With the exception of a few exceptions, most ships are fragmented into units located on the seashore
 udyogikrut deshon main vidyaman saamaanya maanakon or roodhiyon kii tulana main jalpoton ke vikhandan kii vartmaan paddatiyaan kai drushtiyon se anupaalan kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa nahin karti hai
 Some of the shortcomings of these systems include not taking adequate precautionary measures, inadequate training and awareness and all these apply to the dismantling units
 inke alaava bhi kai kamiyaan hai
 Implementation of reforming measures will not only affect the ship dismantling unit, but also on the pre-fragmentation activities and the final destination of disposal of waste materials received during the dismantling and their disposal
 vartmaan jalpot vikhandan paddatiyon kii khaamiyon se jo samasyaayein paidaa hoti hai, unke parinaam maatr paryaavaran ko hi nahin bhugatne hote, balki karmiyon kii vyavsaayik suraksha evam swasthya par bhi bura prabhaav padataa he
 Environmental impacts can be categorized as follows: by enclosing and expanding the space required for fragmentation, the fission industry affects the local environment, environment, and society
 us sthaan main pehle se rahete aa rahe samudaay machhlee pakadaney, krishi aadi moolbhoot udyogon par ashrith ho sakate hai jisase donon ke hiton main takaraahat sambhav he or yah ek vichaarneey mudda ban saktaa he
 Evacuation and emissions to the sea, land and air can cause acute and long-term pollution
 paryaavaran main vishakt padaarthon ke pahunchane ko rokane ke liye parisemen kaa abhaav chintaa kaa ek pramukh vishay he
 Recognizing the need to further improve the processes to properly manage the fragmentation of a growing number of vessels, the Assembly of the Parties to the Basel Pact relating to the control and disposal of transboundary transfer of hazardous wastes was held in December
 In its fifth meeting held in 1999, it was decided to go through this topic
 besel sandhi ke takneekee kaary dal ko jalpoton ke sampurna evam aanshik vikhandan ke paryaavarniya drushti se samuchit prabandh hetu takneekee maardarshak siddhant viksit karne ke kaary kaa shriganesh karne ko kaha gaya
 In addition, the technical task force was asked to list the hazardous wastes and substances subject to the relevant Basel Treaty for ship dismantling
 yah dastavej, jalpoton ke sampurna evam aanshik vikhandan ke paryaavarniya drushti se samuchit prabandh hetu takneekee maardarshak siddhant, ko us uddeshy se taiyaar kiya gaya ki taaki isse un deshon ko maargdarshan mil sake jo jalpot vikhandan suvidhaayen sthapit karnaa chaahate hai
 These guiding principles provide information and recommendations about the procedures, processes and procedures to be implemented for environmentally appropriate management
 ye maardarshak siddhant paryaavarniya nishpaadan ke monitoran or satyaapan ke liye bhi paraamarsh dete hai
 In the context of the Basel Treaty, ESM is defined as: dhara 2, para 8 ke anusaar "khatarnaak apshisht padaarthon or anya padaarthon kaa paryaavarniya drushti se uchit prabandh” se taatpary he "khatarnaak apshisht padaarthon or anya padaarthon kaa prabandhan is tareeke se karnaa ki vah maanav swasthya or paryaavaran ko in apshisht padaarthon ke kaaran honevaale har pratikul prabhaav se bachaae"
 Not taking basic precautionary measures puts personnel safety at stake
 jalpoton ko dikmishan karne ke liye uchit maardarshak siddhant na hone ke kaaran jalpoton ko vikhandan ke liye bhejne ke purv un par aavashyak taiyaariyaan karnaa sambhav nahin hota or isliye jalpot swayan bhi khataron se bhare pitare hote hai
 Even basic steps are not taken to reduce the risk or to remove them completely and this ultimately leads to accidents
 kaary pranaaliyon main paraspar samaayojan kaa abhaav, suvidhaon kaa abhaav or suraksha niyantran kaa abhaav, ye sab bhi jokhim ke vibhinn ang hai
 The main concern of health is exposure to harmful substances, inadequate sanitation facilities and the nature of operation
 jalpot vikhandan ikaayiyon se nikalanevaale pradooshkon ke saamaanya sampark main aana in ikaayiyon ke chaaron ore rahanevaale logon ke swasthya ko jokhim main daal saktaa he
 Ship dismantling workers and local communities may be exposed to cancer-causing substances and other harmful substances such as pcbs, pahs, heavy metals and asbestos
 in padaarthon ke kaaran honevaale hanikaarak parinaam suparichit hai
 These effects can be quite severe and can be passed on to the next generations
 ye maardarshak siddhant is samay jalpoton ko punashchakran ikai main bhejne ke purv unase khatarnaak padaarthon ko jahaan tak ho sake hataane ke upayon par prakaash nahin daalate hai
 However, the parties of the Basel Treaty believe that to solve the problems related to the recycling of ships, it is very important to formulate guiding principles to reduce waste in this way
 iemo / emipisi is mudde tathaa isse sambandhit anya muddon par kaam kar rahe hai
 They are developing short term and long term action plans
 iske saath hi, in maardarshak siddhanton main jalpot punashchakran se jude vyavsaayik swasthya or suraksha ke pahaluon par gaharaai se charchaa nahin hui he
 The International Labor Organization has taken charge of formulating such guiding principles
 jab ye siddhant taiyaar ho jaaenge, inkaa yahaan samavesh kiya ja saktaa he
 The Secretariat of the Basel Pact has requested unep's Department of Technology, Industry and Economics to jointly consider the possibility of jointly taking up the task of developing guiding principles for downstream recycling operations following the dismantling of ships
 yahaan jin vishyon ko liya gaya he ve maatr jalpot vikhandan ke takneekee or karypranali pahaluon se sambandhit hai
 It is assumed that legal questions related to the export of ships as hazardous waste are yet to be inspected by the Legal Working Group of the Basel Convention
 ye maardarshak siddhant vartmaan jalpot vikhandan suvidhaon or nai suvidhaon donon par lagu hote hai
 Current practices have been mentioned in the current facilities as the starting point of the process of systematically implementing ESM principles
 yah prakriya vartmaan karypranaliyon or adarsh suvidha main jo bhed he, use rekhaankit karti he
 The new facilities are expected to comply with the standards of ideal facilities

 kisi bhi samay par sanchika kaa ek aakaar hoga, aamtaur par yah biton main abhivyakt kiya jaataa he or yah darshata he ki is sanchika ne bhandar main kitni jagah gheri hui he
 In most modern operating systems this size can be any nonnegative integer, but will have a maximum limit according to the system
 lekin sanchika kii saadhaaran paribhaasha yah lazimi nahin tehraati he ki uske maujuuda aakaar kaa koi vaastavik arth ho, sivaay us maamle main jab sanchika kii saamagree, ek drudh sangrah ke samooh ke andar kii kuch saamagree ho
 For example, in a Unix-like system, the file to which the link to / bin / ls points is defined and rarely changed
 isaki tulana / dev / null se karen to yah bhi ek sanchika he par iskaa aakaar hameshaa badalata rahata he balki shaayad us tarah myne hi nahin rakhata he jaise pichley udhaaharan kaa myne rakhata he
 The information and small information contained in a computer file can be in the form of bundles or can also be movable
 yah maatr sanchika ke rachanaakaar par nirbhar he ki usamen jaankaree kaa aayojan kis prakaar kiya jayega
 For this reason, many low-standard file structures exist that can serve any purpose, from the simplest to the most complex
 adhiktar sanganak sanchikaon kaa istemaal sanganak kaarykram karte hai
 These programs create, change and delete the appropriate files for their use
 jo kaarykram-nirmaataa in kaaryakramon ko banaate hai, vahi faisalaa karte hai ki koun si filon kii zarurat he, unka istemaal kaise hona he or unke naam bhi ve nirdhaarit karte hai
 In some cases, computers manipulate program files in such a way that they are visible to the computer user
 udhaaharan ke liye shabd-sansaadhan carkram main prayokta dastauez sanchikaon main badlaav karte hai or prayokta khud hi unhen naam bhi dete hai
 The contents of the document file are organized in such a way that the word-processing program understands it, but the user determines its name and storage address, and the key information of storage is also determined by the user
 kai anuprayog sabhi saamagree sanchikaon ko ek hi sanchika main ghused dete hai or alag alag prakaar kii jaankaree kaa hisaab rakhane ke liye andar hi nishaan laga ke rakhte hai
 Content files from games like Doom and Quake are an example of this
 sanganak par, sanchikaon ko bananaa, badalanaa, badhanaa, chota karnaa, sthanantarit karnaa or mitaanaa sambhav he
 In most cases, all this is done by running computer programs on the computer, but the user of the computer can also make changes to files if needed
 udhaaharan ke liye, microsoft verde kii sanchikaaye aamtaur par prayokta ke nirdeshon ke aadhaar par microsaft verde kaarykram dwaara banaai jaati hai, lekin prayokta in sanchikaon ko sidhe hi windos explorer jaise kisi sanchika prabandhak kaarykram ke jariye bhi hataa, mitaa yaa sthanantirit kar saktaa he
 In unix-like systems, user-zone processes usually do not directly connect to files; The operating system provides a segregation level that allows almost all transactions with files from the user-area to occur through hard links
 kathor kadiyon ke jariye kisi sanchika kaa naam diya ja saktaa he ; vishuddh rup se prachaalan pranali main sanchikaon ke naam nahin hote hai
 For example, user-area programs cannot delete a file, they can only delete a link to that file, and if the linker finds that the file no longer has any other links, it can delete this file
 Can be erased
 vastav main keval ashthi hi sanchikaon se len-dein karata he, par prayokta-kshetra ke anurodhon kaa sanchikaon ke jariye is tarah hota he ki prayokta-kshetra kaaryakramon ko yah agyaat hi rahata he
 While the transaction of programs with files varies according to the operating system and file system, mainly these activities are common: aadhunik sanganak pranaaliyon main sanchikaon tak pahunchne ke liye aamtaur par filanaamon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In some operating systems, this name is associated with the file
 kuch anya main sanchika swayan benaam hoti he, par namit kadiyaan uski ore ingit karti hai
 In this case, the user can only recognize the link as the file name, but this will not be true, especially when the same file has more than one link
 sanchikaaye nirdeshikaon main ho sakati hai
 But it would be better to say that the directory can contain a list of files or a list of links to files
 is paribhaasha ke antargat yah samajhnaa bahut zaruri he ki "sanchika" shabd main nirdeshikas bhi shaamil hai
 This makes staging of directories possible, ie subdirectories inside directories
 jo naam kisi nirdeshika ke andar kisi sanchika ko sanderbhit karata he, use anokhaa hona zaruri he
 But some operating systems also specify a type with a name, which makes it possible to have two different types of files in a directory with the same name, such as a directory and a file of the same name
 jin paryaavarnon main sanchikaaye namit hoti hai, unamem, sanchika ke naam va path kii jodi anokhi honi zaruri he - koi bhi do sanchikaon kaa naam va path dono kisi or sanchika ke naam va path se mail nahin kha sakate hai
 Where the file is anonymous, named references will reside under a namespace
 adhiktar baar kisi bhi namasthaan main maujuud naam thik ek yaa shunya sanchikaon ko sanderbhit karegaa
 However, any file can be referenced in a namespace with zero, one or more names
 anuprayog ke prasang ke anusaar, kisi bhi sanchika yaa kadi ke liye upyukt naam kinhin khaas aksharon se bani hogi
 The computer system depends on whether the name is appropriate or not
 praarambhik sanganak kisi sanchika ke naam main simit akshar va ankon kii anumati dete the, lekin aadhunik sanganak lambey naam rakhane dete hai jinamein lagbhag kisi bhi kram main unicode akshar yaa unicode ank ho sakate hai, taaki ek hi nazar main sanchika kaa makasad samaj aa jaae
 Some computer systems allow empty spaces in file names, some do not
 sanchika naamon kii laghuderghakshar samvedansheeltaa sanchika pranali dwaara nirdhaarit hoti he
 Unix file systems are typically short-term and allow user-level applications to create files that contain only short and long letters
 microsoft windos kai sanchika pranaliyaan pradaan karata he, jinamein lugh-deergh samvedansheeltaa kii nitiyaan alag alag hai
 If the user uses a disk editor to change file names in directory entries, then the prevalent FAT system may contain many files whose names differ only by capitalization
 lekin, aamtaur par prayokta anuprayog isaki anumati nahin dete hai
 Most computers organize files based on steps and use folders, directories or catalogs for this
 shabd jo bhi ho vichaar ek hi he
 Each folder may contain some number of files and may contain other folders
 in anya folderon ko upfolder kehete hai
 These may contain more files and folders, etc
, etc
, by creating a tree-like structure containing a "master folder" or under which any number of files and folders can be
 folderon ke bhi sanchikaon kii tarah naam ho sakate hai 
 It is easy to organize files logically through folders
 jab bhi koi sanganak folderon kaa istemaal karata he to harek sanchika va folder kaa keval apana naam hi nahin apitu ek path bhi hota he jo yah darshata he ki vah sanchika yaa folder kis folder yaa folderon main maujuud he
 In this path, a special mark - such as / - is written between the file or folder names
 udhaaharan ke liye is lekh main die udhaaharan main, / Payroll / Salaries / Managers yah darshata he ki Managers naamak ek sanchika, Salaries naamak folder main he, r yah folder Payroll main he
 There is a forward line between the file and folder names, the topmost or root folder has no name, so the name starts with a forward line
 kai sanganak pranaliyaan sanchika naamon me vistaaron kaa istemaal karte hai, inhen sanchika prakaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 In Windows computers, the extension takes the form of a dot after the name of the file and a few characters before the point, these characters are the type of file identified
 
txt vistaar paathya sanchika kaa pahchaan he, 
doc vistaar kisi dastauez kaa pahchaan he, khaastaur par microsoft verde sanchika praaroop main; aadi ityadi
 Even when extensions are used on the computer system, there is considerable diversity in the extent to which the computer system recognizes and behaves according to them, in some systems they are indispensable, while in others they are also present
 It does not matter, they are ignored
 kai aadhunik sanganak pranaliyaan sanchikaon ko nuksaan pahunchne se rokane ke tareeke pradaan karti he
 Computers that allow more than one user also enforce file permissions to control which files and folders can be created, deleted, or changed
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi prayokta ko ek sanchika ko badalane kii anumati ho sakati he par mitaane kii nahin, yaa phir sanchikaaye va folder banane kii anumati ho sakati he par mitaane kii nahin
 It can also be determined through permissions that only a few users can see the contents of a file or folder
 anumatiyon ke jariye sanchikaon main maujuud saamagree ke avaidh badlaav yaa vinaash se bachaav hota he or nijee jaankaree ko gopneey rakhane ke liye avaidh prayoktaaon ko kuch sanchikaaye dekhne se roka ja saktaa he
 Many computers have another rescue method known as "read only mark"
 yah chihn lage hone par sanchiko kaa nirikshan kiya ja saktaa he par badla nahin ja saktaa he
 This sign is useful for critical information that should not be changed or erased, such as for certain files used by internal components of a computer system
 kuch pranaliyaan ek "chhipi hui chihn" bhi shaamil karti hai, jo yah sunishchit karata he ki sanchika adrishy ho jaae
 With this symbol, the computer system hides important system files that should not be changed by users
 uparokt charchaa main sanchika kaa varnan ek ucch stareey prachaalan pranali yaa prayokta ke liye ek pariklpana ke taur par hua he
 However, any file must be physically present to be truly workable
 arthath, ek sanchika kii amoort avadharana ko vaastavik sanganak pranali main vaastavik bhautik rup main hona aavashyak he, anyathaa uskaa aastitiv hona na hona baraabar he
 Physically, most computer files are stored in some kind of content storage device
 udhaaharan he hard jisk, jiske jariye adhiktar prachaalan pranaliyaan chalati hai
 Most of the files are kept in these
 21veen sadi ke praarabdh main hard discs sarvaadhik uplabdh gaiyr vaashpashil bhandaaran upkaran he
 If the files contain only temporary contents, they can be stored in RAM
 unics jaisi prachaalan pranaaliyon main kai sanchikaon kaa kisi bhautik bhandaaran upkaran se sidhaa vaasta nahin hota he: / dev / null iskaa ek pramukh udhaaharan he, isi tarah / dev, / proc or / sys ke antarangat maujuud lagbhag sabhi sanchikaaye bhi isi prakaar kii hai
 They can be used as files in the user area
 lekin ye abhaasi sanchikaaye hai jo vastav main keval prachaalan pranali kii ashthi kii vastuon ke taur par vidyaman rahati hai
 Computer files can be stored in magnetic strips
 kuch sthitiyon main sanchikaon ko anya madhyamon main bhi bhandaarit kiya ja saktaa he jaise ki lekhneey kampact discs, ankiy bahuvid discs, zip drive, yuasabi flash drive aadi
 When the computer files contain very important information, the copying process tries to avoid the consequences in situations where the files can be lost
 sanchikaon kii pratilipi karne kaa matlab bas yahi he ki sanchikaon kii pratiyaan kisi anya sthaan par baan ke rakhana taaki yadi mul sanganak ko kuch ho jaataa he yaa ve galati se mit jaati hai to prati ke jariye unhen waapas paaya ja sake
 There are several ways to copy files
 adhiktar sanganak pranaliyaan suvidhaatmak kaarykram pradaan karte hai jo ki prati rakhane kii prakriya main suvidha pradaan karte hai, kyonki yadi bahut si sanchikaon kii pratiyaan rakhni hai to isamen bahut samay lag saktaa he
 Files are often copied to transferable mediums such as writable cds or cartridge tapes
 ek hi sanganak kii duusari hard discs main sanchikaon ko pratilipit karne se ek discs ke kharaab hone se to bachaav ho jaataa he par yadi puure sanganak ke kharaab yaa nasht hone ke jokhim se bachaav karnaa he to un sanchikaon kii pratiyaan aise madhyam main karnaa zaruri he jo is sanganak se dur le ja ke kisi surakshit jagah par bhandaarit kii ja sake
 The grand-father-son copy method automatically creates three copies, the oldest copy of the file being the grandfather file and the son existing copy
 kis sanganak dwaara sanchikaon ko yojit, namit, bhandaarit va parivartit karne kii pranali ko uski sanchika pranali kaha jaataa he
 Most operating systems have at least one file system
 kai prachaalan pranaaliyon main kai sanchika pranaliyaan ek saath chalaai ja sakati he
 For example, newer MS Windows computers support older fat-style file systems of MS-DOS, as well as NTFS, the popular file system of the latest Windows versions
 har pranali ke apane faayde nuksaan hai
 For example, in standard FAT, only 8-letter file names run, whereas NTFS contains possible long file names that may contain spaces
 aap kisi sanchika ko antiatioes main Payroll records jaisaa naam de sakate hai lekin effeti main yah naam kuch payroll
dat jaisaa hi ho saktaa he 
 File manager programs are convenient programs through which files and folders can be moved, created, deleted, or renamed, but they do not actually allow you to read or add content to the file
 har sanganak pranali apni mul sanchika pranali ke liye kam se kam ek sanchika prabandhak pradaan karata he
 The most commonly used file manager program in Windows is Windows Explorer and on Mac it is Finder
 linaks main notilas, conkvarar jaise kai sanchika prabandhak hai
 The use of the English word "file" for file storage in reference to computer storage was started since 1952 for information stored in camouflage leaves
 praarambhik prayog main log antarnihit tantransh ko hi fil kehete the
 For example, IBM 350's disk drives were called "disk files"
 1962 ke sangat samay saajha pranali jaisi pranaaliyon main aisi sanchika pranaliyaan thim jo ek hi sanchay upkaran par kai "sanchikaaye" pradarshit karti thim or is tarah is shabd kaa aadhunik upyog shuru hua
 CTSS file names had two parts, a user-readable "principal name" and the other "secondary name" that indicated the type of file
 yah aachaar kai prachaalan pranaaliyon dwaara aaj bhi kaam main liya jaataa he, inamen microsoft windos bhi shaamil he
 While the "register file" used today shows the initial hypothesis of files, it is often lost

 amarsingh rathod marwar rajya ke prasiddh rajput the
 He was the courtier of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan of India in the 17th century
 apane parivaar dwaara nirvasit karne ke baad wo mughalon kii seva main aaye
 His famous bravery and fighting ability resulted in him receiving royal honor and personal recognition by the emperor
 jiske baad unhen nagaur kaa subedaar banaaya gaya or baad main unhone hi yahan shashan kiya
 In his unauthorized absence in 1644, the emperor was angered by taxation and slapped Salabat Khan with a sword responsible for taking the tax
 unka varnan rajasthan, pashchimi uttar pradesh or punjab ke kuch lokgito main prasiddhi praapt he
 Raja Gaj Singh was the ruler of the Marwar region under the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan
 unke putr amar singh rathod ek mahaan yoddha or ek deshbhakt the, lekin unke pita ne unhen mughalon se ek daaku ko bachaane ke kaaran rajya se nirvasit kar diya tha
 He later joined Shah Jahan's Delhi Sultanate where he impressed Shah Jahan with his valor
 jisase unhen nagaur kaa jagirdaar banaaya gaya
 However, Salabat Khan, brother of the Emperor, was jealous of the rise of Amar Singh Rathore in the kingdom and was waiting for an opportunity to discredit Amar Singh
 unhen jald hi yah mauka mil gaya jab amar singh kii anadhikrut anupasthiti ke bare main kuch choti si chizon ke bare main pataa chalaa
 Salabat Khan raised it so much as an issue that Shah Jahan ordered the punishment of Amar Singh from Salabat
 iskaa phayda uthaate hue, salaabat ne amar singh ko dhamka kar usee vakt dand kaa bhugtan karne ko kaha
 Salabat also warned that he would not let Amar Singh go without paying the penalty
 amar singh ne apni talwaar baahar nikaali or salaabat ko maukey par maut ke ghat utaar diya
 Emperor Shah Jahan was also taken aback by the incident and ordered his troops to kill Amar Singh
 haalanki, bahadur amar ne apane yuddh kaushal ko dikhaaya or un sabhi ko maar daalaa jinhone unpar akraman kiya tha
 He quickly fled the fort and returned to a safe place
 agle din adaalat main samraat ne ghoshnaa kii ki amar singh ko maarane vaale ko jagirdaar bana diya jayega haalanki koi bhi amar singh rathore ke saath dushmani mol lene ke liye taiyaar nahin tha, kyonki unhen sirf ek din pehle hi amar singh krodh kaa saamana karnaa padaa tha
 Arjun Singh, who was Amar Singh's brother-in-law, greedily accepted the challenge
 arjunasingh ne amarsingh se kaha ki shahjahan ko apni galati kaa ehsaas ho gaya he or ve amarsingh jaisaa yoddha nahin khona chahta
 Though Amar Singh did not believe in the beginning, he soon got caught in the art of betrayal of Arjun Singh
 is bich, shahjahan kii adaalat ke saamne ek chota darwaja khadaa kiya gaya tha, jisase amar singh ko adaalat main pravesh karne ke liye uske saamne jhukna padegaa
 Seeing Amar's acts first and the proceedings in court, a curious fakir asked the emperor "how can we conquer Hindustan with so many warriors" Shah Jahan said, "wait and see how we will do"
 amar samraat ke saamne jhukne ke liye taiyaar nahin tha or arjunasingh ne ye jaan liya
 He asked Amar Singh to enter first
 amar ne unki salaah maan lee, arjunasingh duusari taraf se aayaa or amar singh kii chaati main khanjar ghonp diya ,amar singh vahi par veergati ko praapt hue
 So Arjun Singh cut off his head and took it to the emperor
 raja ne fakir kii ore ishaara kiya or kaha "ab tumhen pataa he ki hamane yoddhaon se kaise chhutkaaraa dilaayaa"
 Later Shah Jahan also killed Arjun Singh
 amar singh kii mrityu kii soochna par, unki patni ,bhallu singh or ram singh ke netritv main rajput sainikon ke saath kile par hamalaa kiya jahaan amar singh kaa sharir padaa tha
 However, thousands of Mughal soldiers surrounded the Rajput forces
 bahadur rajput balon ne unhen virodh kiya jab tak amar singh ke sharir ko kile se dur nahin liya gaya
 Although all those Rajput fighters dedicated their lives to death, they never bowed down to the Mughal Sultanate
 baad main, kile main sankeern darwaja lokapriy rup se amar singh darwaja ke rup main janaa jane laga kyonki yah muslim sena ke upar rajput bahaduree kaa pratik tha
 Some historians claim that Shah Jahan ordered the door to be closed permanently as it reminded him of his defeat at the hands of Rajput forces
