 Newton's laws of motion are three physical laws that form the basis of sustainable mechanics
 ye niyam kisi vastu par lagane vaale bal or usase utpann us vastu kii gati ke bich sambandh bataate hai
 They have been expressed in many ways in three centuries
 newton ke gati ke teenon niyam, parmparik rup se, sankshep main nimnlikhit hai- Newton first compiled them in his book Philosophy Naturalis Principia Mathematica
 newton ne anek sthanon par bhautik vastuon kii gati se sambandhit samasyaon kii vyakhya main inkaa prayog kiya tha
 In the third part of his book, Newton demonstrated that these three laws of motion and their universal law of gravitation are capable of interpreting Kepler's laws related to the motion of celestial bodies
 newton ke gati niyam sirf unhi vastuon par lagaaya jaataa he jinhen ham ek kan ke rup main maan sake
 Meaning that when measuring the speed of those objects, their size is ignored
 un vastuon ke pind ko ek bindu main kendrit man kar in niyamo ko lagaaya jaataa he
 This is done when the distances in the analysis are much larger than the objects
 isliye grahon ko ek kan maan kar unke kakshiya gati ko mapa ja saktaa he
 In its original form, the rules of these motions cannot be applied to fixed and deformable bodies
 1750 main leonard ular ne newton ke gati niyamo kaa vistaar kiya or ular ke gati niyamon kaa nirmaan kiya jinhen drudh or virupanshil pindo par bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 If an object is considered to be a combination of discrete particles, in which Newton's laws of motion can be applied separately, Euler's law of motion can be derived from Newton's law of motion
 newton ke gati niyam bhi kuch nirdesh tantron main hi lagu hote he jinhen jadtviya nirdesh tantra kaha jaataa he
 Many authors believe that the first rule defines the inertial instruction system and the second law is valid only with those instruction systems, for this reason the first rule cannot be called a special form of the second law
 par kuch pehle niyam ko duusare kaa parinaam maanate he
 The explicit concept of directive systems developed long after Newton died
 newtoni yantriki kii jagah ab oinstin ke vishesh aapekshikta ke siddhant ne le lee he par phir bhi iskaa istemaal prakaash kii gati se kam gati vaale pindon ke liye abhi bhi kiya jaataa he
 In Newton's original words hindi anuwaad "every object remains in its stagnation or uniform velocity until it is induced to change its state by some external factor
 " In other words, the object which is in resting state will remain in the resting state and the object which is in motion will remain in motion unless any external force is applied on it
 newton kaa pratham niyam padaarth ke ek prakritik gun jadtv ko paribhaashit karat he jo gati main badlaav kaa virodh karata he
 Therefore, the first law is also called the law of inertia
 yah niyam apratksh rup se jadtviya nirdesh tantra tathaa bal ko bhi paribhaashit karata he
 Because of this, this rule was put first by Newton
 is niyam kaa saral pramanikaran mushkil he kyonki gharshan or gurutvkarshan ke prabhaav ko zyaadaatar pind mahasoos karte hai
 Actually, Galileo described this observation before Newton
 newton ne anya shabdon main ise vyakt kiya
 In Newton's original words: hindi main anuwaad "A change in the momentum of an object is proportional to the impact on the object and occurs in the same direction
" "newton ke is niyam se adholikhit bindu vyupatrit kiye ja sakate he : Where f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} force, p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} momentum and t { \ displaystyle t} are time
 is sameekaran ke anusaar, jab kisi pind par koi bahya bal nahin he, to pind kaa samveg sthir rahata he
 When the mass of the body is constant, the equation can be written in a simpler form: jahaan m { \ displaystyle m} dravyaman he or a → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {a}}} twaran he
 That is, the acceleration of a body is proportional to the force applied
 aaveg dwitiya niyam se sambandhit he
 Impulse means a change in momentum
 arthath: Where i is the impulse
 aaveg takkaron ke vishleshan main bahut ahm he
 Let the mass of a body be m
 is par ek niyam bal f ko ∆tsamayanwarala ke liye lagane par veg main ∆v parivartit ho jaataa he
 Then Newton- atah kisi pind ko diya gaya aaveg, pind main utpann samveg- parivartan ke samaan hota he
 Therefore, the unit of impulse is the same as that of the impulse
 tritiy niyam kaa arth he ki kisi bal ke sangat ek or bal he jo uske samaan or vipareet he
 Newton used this rule to describe the law of momentum conservation, but actually momentum conservation is a more fundamental principle
 kai udahaaran hai jinamein samveg sangrakshit hota he lekin tritiy niyam maanya nahin he

 Nukta refers to the point placed under a consonant letter in Devanagari, Gurmukhi and other Brahmi family scripts
 is se us akshar kaa uccharan parivartit hokar kisi anya vyanjan kaa ho jaataa he
 For example, nukta under 'h' becomes 'z' and 'n' under 'd' becomes 'e'
 nuqte aise vyanjanon ko banane ke liye prayog hote hai jo pehle se mul lipi main na hon, jaise ki 'dh' mul devanagari varnmaala main nahin tha or na hi yah sanskrit main paaya jaataa he
 The arabic-persian script also uses negatives in letters, for example 'ر' is pronounced 'R' while writing 'ز' in the same letter is pronounced 'Z'
 in bhashaaon main ja evam za, donon hi shabd uplabdh evam prayog hote hai, enke alaava ek anya za bhi hota he jinke liye nimna shabd prayog hote hai: ja ke liye jim, za ke liye zwaad / ze / zaal / zoe - ye chaar akshar hote hai
 It is worth noting here that despite having four letters for z, there is a gym for z
 atah jim kaa prayog bhi hota he, jaise jazbaa main ja evam za donon hi prayukt hai
 Gaf is also used for c and g for g in many such places
 mul rup se 'nuqta' arabi bhashaa kaa shabd he or iskaa matlab 'bindu' hota he
 In ordinary hindi-urdu, it means 'point'
 hindi main prayog hone vaale nuqtedaar akshar or unke bina nukte vaale rup neeche kii talika die gaye hai

 Grammar scholars like Kishoridas Vajpayee are not in favor of criticizing Hindi writing
 unka kahana he ki ye sab shabd ab hindi ke apane ho gaye hai or hindi bhashi in shabdon kaa uccharan aise hi karte hai jaise unamem nukta nahin laga ho

 At that time, Maharaja Ranjit Singh started a campaign to free Kashmir from the clutches of Atamohammad, the Subedar of Kashmir
 is abhiyaan se bhaybheet hokar atamohammad kashmir chhodkar bhaag gaya
 There was another reason behind the Kashmir campaign
 atamohammad ne mahmud shah dwaara parajeet shahshuja ko shergarh ke kile main kaid kar rakhaa tha

 But Wafa Begum delayed the offering of Kohinoor diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh as promised

 When the Maharaja asked Shahshuja about the Kohinoor diamond, both he and his begum started making excuses
 jab zyada jor diya gaya to unhone ek nakli hira maharaja ranjit singh ko saunp diya, jo johariyon ke pareekshan kii kasuti par nakli sabit hua
 Ranjit Singh was filled with anger and Mubarak Haveli was surrounded

 Somehow the Maharaja came to know about this
 at: unhone shahshuja ko kabul kii rajgaddi dilaane ke liye "gurugranth sahab" par haath rakhkar pratigya kii
 Then he changed his turban to Kohinoor to make him a "turban-changing brother"

 Now Kohinoor had reached Maharaja Ranjit Singh and he was satisfied that he had liberated Kashmir
 unki ichha thi ki ve kohinoor heere ko jagannathpuri ke mandir main pratishthit bhagwaan jagannatha ko arpit karen
 He was famous for offering mana gold to Hindu temples

 Blade Runner by writer Philip K
 Dick's actions attracted Hollywood attention, and since then more films based on his writings have been made
 Ridley Scott sees Blade Runner as "possibly" his most complete and personal film

 In Los Angeles, on November 2019, retired police officer Rick Deckard is stopped by Officer Gaff at a noodle bar
 uske purv paryvekshak bryant use bataata he ki anek replicants - jaivik rup se banaae gayi maanvabh mashin jo duniya baahar ke upniveshon main sainik or gulam kii tarah karyrat the - bhaag khadey hue hai or avidh rup se prithvi par chale aaye hai
 When active as a "blade Runner", Deckard's job was to find such replicants in the earth and "retire" them

 These replicants - the Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 model - have a life span of four years, done in terms of security to prevent the development of feelings and desire for freedom in them
 They can come to Earth and try to extend their life span

 While there, Deckard discovers that Tyrell's assistant Richel is an experimental replicant who considers himself human; Rachel's consciousness is heightened by Tyrell's niece's childhood memories

 Hasan tells Deckard the address of a strip club where Zohra works
 decard jhora ko "ritair" kar detaa he, uski mrityu dhimi gati se hoti he kyonki vah bhaagane ke liye sangharsh karti he
 Shortly afterwards Deckard meets Bryant and asks him to add Rachel's name to his list of retirements, as she has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation headquarters
 decard bheed main rashel ko dekh letaa he, lekin leon us par hamalaa kar detaa he
 By killing Leon, Rachel saves Deckard and the two return to Deckard's apartment, where he stops Rachel from going in and manages to convince her that she wants to have sex with him
 roy sebastian ke apartment main aata he or pris se kahata he ki ab sirf ve donon hi bache hai
 After explaining their plight, they get Sebastian's help
 roy ko pataa chalata he ki sebastian ek anuvanshik vikaar se peedit he jisase uski umr bad gayi he
 In the correspondence chess game they were playing, Roy and Sebastian enter Tyrell's penthouse on the pretext of informing Tyrell of a winning move by Sebastian
 roy apane nirmaataa se apni jivan avadhi ke vistaar kii maang karata he
 Tyrell tells that Tyrell Corporation has never had any way to do this work
 Roy seeks forgiveness for his sins, confessing that he has done "offensive work"
 tyrel roy ke aparaadh ko khaarij karte hue roy kii unnat dizin or uski uplabdhiyon kii prashansa karata he
 He tells Roy to "revel in his time", to which Roy remarks "there is nothing whose god of biotechnology will not let you go to heaven"
 Roy then holds Tyrell's head with his hands and kisses him and kills him
 sebastian elieater kii ore bhaagta he, roy uskaa peechha karata he
 Roy alone descends from the elevator and Sebastian is not seen again
 decard sebastian ke apartment main aata he or pris us par hamalaa karti he
 He retires before Roy returns
 roy diwaar par mukka markar decard ke daahine haath ko jakad letaa he or jhora or pris ke pratishodh main vah uski do anguliyaan tod detaa he
 Roy leaves Deckard and gives him time to flee, then he searches for him in the Bradbury building
 roy kii simit jivan avadhi ke lakshan badtar hone lagate hai or uskaa dahinaa haath jhulane lagata he; vah us par niyantran banaae rakhane ke liye usamen apane nakhun gada detaa he
 Roy forces Deckard to go to the roof
 roy se bhaagane ke prayaas main decard ek anya imaarat par chalaang lagaataa he, lekin puri tarah safal nahin ho paata he or barish se kaai jami shateer par latak jaataa he
 Deckard's grip begins to loosen, then Roy jumps without effort, grabs his arm and pulls him back to the roof
 jab roy kaa jivan samaapt ho rahaa hota he, tab vah apane jivan par swagat bhaashan karata he "maine ansi chijen dekhi hai jin par tum log vishwaas nahin karoge; mrug nakshatra ke kandhe se jahaazon par hamale karke aag lagate dekha he; tanhosar get ke kareeb andhkaar main si-bims chamak dekhi he
 All those moments will be lost in time; Like tears are lost in the rain
 Now the time of death has come
 " That's when Gaff arrives and calls Deckard good and bad
 "yah bahut buree baat he ki vah nahin jiegi; lekin vaise bhi, koun jeeta he?" decard apane ghar lautataa he to rashel ko jivit paata he
 When they leave, Deckard finds a paper unicorn, a calling card left by Gaff
 film ke ant main decard or rashel ghar chhodkar kisi anishchit bhavishya kii ore jate hai yaa phir kisi adarsh dehati paridrishy se driving karte hue guzarate hai, yah sanskaran par nirbhar karata he
 Although Blade Runner is apparently an action film, it operates on several dramatic and narrative levels; The film noir trend is credited for this: the fame of Femme Fatales, the pro-narration, the dark and blurry cinematography and the protagonist's skeptical moral outlook - in this case, an expansion to include contemplation of the nature of one's own humanity
 yah ek sakshar science fiction katha film he, vishay-vastu kii drushti se dharm ke darshan or shastreey unani naatak or ghamand ke pariprekshya main anuvaanshik enjineering par maanav kii maharath ke naitik prabhaavon ko saamne laata he, noaah kii baadh jaisi bible kii upamaaon ko or frenkstin jaise saahitiyik sroton ko chitrit karata he
 Linguistically, the chess game between Roy and Tyrell, based on the famous eternal game of 1851, is subtly a repetition of the subject of impermanence, though according to Scott it is a coincidence
 blade ranor paryaavaran or samaaj par praudyogiki ke prabhaavon ko jaanane ke liye ateet tak pahunchakar gahan shodh karata he, iske liye sahitya, dharmik pratikwaad, shastreey naatakeey vishay vastu or film noir kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 This tension between past, present, and future is reflected in the retrofitted future of Blade Runner, which is high-tech and shiny in many places, but the rest seems to be bad and outdated

 Corporate power dominates, police as if have become ubiquitous, vehicles and warning lights are engaged in building investigations, and the result is the detection of large biomedical power over the individual — especially because of their programming of replicants
 About the results of Control of the environment is depicted on a large scale, going hand in hand with the lack of any natural life, with the artificial creature replacing its extinct mold
 This oppressive backdrop explains the context of the continued migration of humans into colonies beyond Earth
 blade ranor main khoji gayi tabaahi yaa aatank rajya kii vishay vastu sibar aparaadh avadharanaon ke praarambhik udhaaharan hai jinhen film main vistaarit kiya gaya
 The eyes have recurring motives, as they manipulate images, raising questions over reality and our ability to experience and remember it accurately
 blade ranor ke maanavtaa kii jaanch ke kendriya vishay ke liye ye vishaygat tatv ek anischitata kaa vaataavaran pradaan karte hai
 An empathy test is used to find replicants, many of its questions focused on the treatment of animals, making it seem as if it is an indispensable indicator of one's "humanity"
 maanav charitra ke nikat ke replicants main samanubhuti kii kami he, jabaki replicants dayaa dikhaate or ek-duusare ke prati chintaa karte dekhe jate hai or usee samay sadakon par maanav bheed bhaavana rahit or nirvaiyaktik hoti he
 Whether or not Deckard is human, the film even casts doubts on whether Deckard is human or not, and the film forces viewers to reevaluate what a human means
 film kii relies ke samay se hi yah sawaal khada kiya jaataa rahaa he ki kya decard ko ek maanav dikhaanaa tha yaa ek riplicant
 maaikel deale or harrison ford donon hi decard ko maanav bananaa chaahate rahe, jabaki hampton fanchar ne aspashtataa rakhana pasand kiya
 Ridley Scott has confirmed that Deckard is a replicant in his vision
 nirdeshak cat main daale gayi decard ke unicorn ke sapane ko gaff dwaara kagaz ke unicorn rupi uphaar ko chhodane ke sanyog ko anek log is tarah dekhte hai ki decard ek riplicant he or uske pratyaropit yaadon main gaff kii pahunch he
 Deckard is a replicant, this interpretation was challenged by others, who believe that the character, whether human or a replicant, the Unicorn's figure of speech suggests that he can dream the same and identify their subjectivity
 Or, the absence of a decisive answer to the main theme of the film is important
 film main nihit aspashtataa or anischitata, saath hi granth sambandhi isaki sampannataa ke kaaran darshakon ne ise apane-apane drushtikon se dekha
 The film differed significantly from its original inspiration due to Fancher's deviation from the novel, numerous rewrites before and during the film's shooting, and Ridley Scott's unread reading of the novel despite the film being based on the novel
 Some of the themes of the novel being reduced or given include: fertility / infertility of the population, religion, mass media, Deckard's uncertainty about whether he is human and real versus artificial pets and emotions

 Ultimately, he admitted that there are legitimate reasons to republish the novel, even if it costs money
 It was a triumph, not just of contractual obligations, but of theoretical ideals "

 Scott at first refused to do the project, but after leaving the slow-build Dunne realized the need for a high-speed project to forget his older brother's recent death

 Norsay's novel The Bledrunner
 The cinematic treatment by Burrows was titled Bledrunner
 Scott liked the name, so delay obtained the title rights
 He eventually hired David Peoples to rewrite the script, and Fancher quit on 21 December 1980 due to controversy over the issue, although he later did additional rewriting work
