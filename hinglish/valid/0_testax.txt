 Book: Ruled or Misruled: The Story and Destiny of Bihar Writer: Santosh Singh Prakasak: Bloomsbury Behar: The ever-ending Dastaibihar politics has been drawing Bihari and outsiders from the beginning
 or abaki baar to ladaai hi ‘bihari’ or ‘bahari’ ke bich he
 If you want to understand the strategy of this match then this book is for you
 agar aapako jaananaa he ki bihar se congress kaise khatm hui, to yah kitaab padhie
 If you want to know that Lalu Prasad is actually a product of circumstances, then read this book
 agar lalu-rabari or nitish ke shashan main fark kaa saakshaatkaar karnaa he to yah kitaab aapke liye he
 Author Santosh Singh is a journalist of 'indian Express'
 unki research or ground report bihar kii siyaasi jameen par shashan or kushasan kii line ukreti hai
 When a man from Rajasthan reads this book and talks to a man from Bihar, the person in front asks: Have you visited Bihar? Santosh Singh has kept the facts in such a way that they do not look cumbersome
 lekhak patrakaron, netaaon, saamaajik vishleshkon ke intervyuu, akhabaaron chhapi report ke jariye lekhak pathak se baat karata he
 Nowhere seems that the writer is trying to impose something on you
 nihsandeh yah bhashaa kii saralata or sahajata hi he
 The cover of the book is cleverly taken
 yah pathak ko sidhe chah maheene peeche le jaataa he, jab bihar kii board parikshaon main shiksha vyavastha kii kalai kholane vaali yah tasviir sabhi akhabaaron ke pej-1 par chhapi thi
 Santosh Singh talks about the socio-economic achievements of Bihar through Nitish's schemes
 unhen nitish kii uplabdhiyon se nahin jodate
 However, the whole credit is given to Nitish, which should also be given
 masalan rajya main 2007 tak 6 se 14 saal ke 25 lakh bachche skool nahin jate the
 By 2014, this number had come down to less than 2 lakhs
 santosh isamen maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ke principal secretary madan mohan jha ke yogadan kii baat bhi karte hai
 He is the same Madan Mohan, on whose death Nitish sits on the ground outside his house
 santosh aprashikshit shikshakon kii fouj khadi karne par kataaksh bhi karte hai
 Nitish has recruited around three and a half lakh contract teachers by 2015
 kitaab main aise tathy khub hai, jo kisi bhi sajag naagarik ke liye jaananaa jaruri hai or jo pathak kii nolej badhaate hai
 However, there is also a typo error at some places, which makes a book work
 aaj bihar main do hi sabase bade sawaal hai
 Who will form the government and why does Nitish tie up with Lalu
 pehle sawaal kaa jawaab voter ke dil main he
 And if you want to get closer to the answer to the second question, then this book is for you
 kyonki puure vishwaas ke saath to sateek jawaab khud nitish bhi nahin de paa rahe
 This election has been CM Nitish vs PM Modi since the beginning
 nitish ne publicity kaa theka bhi unheen prashanth kishor ko diya he, jinhone loksabhaa chunaav main narendra modi ke prachaar kii kaman sanbhali thi or ‘abaki baar modi sarkaar’ tagaline di thi
 Prashant has given the tagline for Bihar - 'once again, Nitish Kumar'
 yah or baat he ki nitish ne pichley do chunaav 'door tu door' campaning or apane vikaas ke dam par jite
 Many other things are also similar to Sankarshan Thakur's 'single Man'
 nitish loksabhaa chunaav main modi kii jeet ke paanch card ginate hai
 Development, caste, the chaiwala face of OBC, youth and communal polarization
 inhen paanchon kii takkar main nitish ne lalu se gathbandhan kiya
 The development man is Nitish himself
 jati ke santulan ke liye hi nitish ne lalu ko saath liya
 In the obcs, Lalu got 14 per cent Yadavs to help
 16 fisadi muslim voter bhi kam nahin hote
 4 percent Kurmi and eight percent Koeri
 ye sab mahagathbandhan ke paramparaagat voter hai
 However, Nitish is weak on the youth front and BJP will get the benefit of Jitanram Manjhi's Mahadalit voters
 phir 2010 main bihar ke voter ne khud nitish tak ko kanphyus kar diya tha he ki unhen jeet unki soshal ejineering par mili he yaa vikaas ke dam par
 That victory demolished Lalu's muslim-yadav (MY) formula
 vah indradhanushi jeet thi
 Mixed with development and social fabric
 lekin jati bihar kaa sabase bada sach he or nitish ise sweekaar karte hai
 Therefore, in terms of caste and religion, the grand alliance is somewhat heavier than the NDA
 muqabla 51:49 kaa he
 But how much mathematics works in this election, it will be known only on 8 November
 tab tak bihar kii kabhi na khatm hone vaali us dastaan kii charchaa kaashi ke assi se lekar dilli ke lutiyans jone tak jari rahegi
 And even then, because the people of Bihar have understood so much in the last 25 years that they can beat or win anyone, but will never let Bihar lose

 In the 'aaj Tak' mega cricket show 'salaam Cricket' held in Dubai, former Pakistan captain and great fast bowler Vasim Akram has revealed a funny incident on Master blastersachin Tendulkar
 darasal, wasim akram ne bataaya ki jab sachin ne international cricket ke kadam rakhaa to unke pakistan ke pehle daure par hamane sochaa ki ye koun chota sa baccha cricket khilne aa gaya

 So i told him that you have come to the house by asking mummy? However, as a great batsman today Wasim Akram respects Sachin a lot and he confesses that in front of Sachin Endbaji was not at all easy
 wasim akram ke saath is manch par abdul kaadir, mohammad ajaharuddin, harbhajan singh, muthaiya muralidharan, misabah ul haq, younus khan, habibul bashar, ravichandran aswin or madanlaal jaise diggaj shaamil the

 sachin ne kaha tha ki us vakt maine sochaa ki karachi main mere jivan kii pehali test pari shaayad aakhri pari hogi
 i could not figure out what was going on
 ek taraf se vakaar younus bowling kar rahe the to duusari taraf se wasim akram
 i did not know anything and both of them were also doing reverse swing of the ball
 aise atake ke saamne mere paas koi plan nahin tha

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had recommended President Pranab Mukherjee about this change

 singla ko railway board main padonnati dilaane ke liye kathith rup se 90 lakh rupaye kii rishwat lene ke aarope main giraftaar kiya gaya tha
 Ashwini Kumar resigned due to the ongoing controversy over interference in the CBI probe into the allocation of coal blocks

 It said that on the advice of the Prime Minister, the President has given additional charge of Railway Ministry and Law and Law Ministry in order of Dr

 It was decided in that meeting that the CBI report be kept in a sealed envelope instead of sending it as an affidavit to keep the case a secret

 On 6 March, Ashwani Kumar, Attorney General GE Vahanvati, CBI Director Ranjit Sinha, the then Additional Solicitor General Harin Rawal, CBI Joint Secretary OP Galhotra and CBI DIG Ravikant met again in the Law Minister's office

 Some charts of the screening committee were removed from the status report, assuming the order of the minister
 supreme court ne is par sarkaar ko kadi fatkaar lagaayi
 At first the Congress and the government kept on defending Ashwini Kumar, but when the water reached the head, the minister's chair had to be sacrificed

 Why the railway minister's chair derailed? The high-profile political drama, which started on 3 May, ended on 10 May

 The fire of the bribe sparked Pawan Bansal
 3 may kii raat ko sibiai ke bade khulaase or karrwai ke baad uthe bavandar ne bavaal machaa diya
 Pawan Bansal finally had to ask the Congress high command to resign after a week of turmoil
 aaropon kii kadi pawan bansal ke bhaanje vijay singla se shuru hui jiskaa ek sira baad main mamaa pawan bansal se bhi judata gaya

 isi deal ke tahat 3 may ko sibiai ne rishwat kii pehali kisht ke taur par 90 lakh rupye jabt kiye
 Evidence of meeting between Pawan Bansal and Mahesh Kumar has also been revealed many times
 7 april ko dilli main mili the pawan bansal or mahesh kumaar, jabaki 17 april ko bhi mumbai main pawan bansal or mahesh kumaar ke bich mulaakaat kii jaankaree saamne aa chuki he
 In order to become a Railway Board Member from GM, Mahesh Kumar got a promotion ahead of time and according to sources, Pawan Bansal's recommendation was also used in this promotion
 itnaa hi nahin pawan bansal ke nijee sachiv or vijay singla ke bich phone par 40 baar baat hui thi jisame mahesh kumaar se judaa mudda sabase ahm tha
 Ashwini Kumar, who called the press conference the very next day after Ashwini Kumar's resignation as law minister, said she resigned to end the controversies
 ashvini kumaar ne saath hi kaha ki unhen jhootha hi fansaaya ja rahaa he
 Ashwini Kumar said, 'there has been a continuous dispute over the allocation of coal blocks for some time

 The riddle of the tomb and death of Sant Ashutosh Maharaj of Jalandhar is so complicated that it cannot be solved
 hoicourt ne jahaan 15 din ke andarsamadhi ke drame ko shmashaan tak pahunchane kaa hukmdiya he, vahiin bhakt hai ki unki maut ko hi jhuthalane main lage hai
 In such a situation, now everyone fears that this matter may not get complicated like the Satlok Ashram of Sant Rampal
 sawaal ye ki kya jalandhar ke nazadik nur mahal kasbe kaa ye divya jyoti jagriti santhaan bhi haryana ke satalok ashram kii tarah aasthaa or kaanoon ke takaraav kaa akhaada ban jayega?kya rampal ko giraftaar se bachaane kii tarz parashutosh maharaj ke shishybhi apane guru kii laash ko antim sanskaar ko rokane ke liye kaayade kanoonon ke aade aa jaaenge? yaa is ashram se bhi ek sant kii laash ko baahar nikaalane ke liye logon kii jaan-maal daanv par lag jaaegi?ye sawaal isliye kyonki punjab and haryana hai court ne ab apane nae farmaan main usashutosh maharajaka 15 dinon main antim sanskaar kar dene kaa hukum diya he, jo pichley 10 maheene se bhi zyaada vakt se ek freezar main band hai
 The doctor has declared them dead on 29 January 2014 only
 lekin maharaj ke bhakt hai ki ye maanane ko taiyaar hi nahin, balki unka to ye kahana he ki maharaj khud apni marji se gahari samadhi main leen hai
 And in such a situation, it is impossible to think of him, even if he is cremated, and these devotees of Maharaj have kept his dead body in a freezer
 is ummid se ki kabhi kisi rose maharaj samadhi se baahar niklenge or phir se apane bhakton ke bich phir se hansate-khelte haazir ho jaaenge
 However, the faith of devotees has its place and science and law have their place
 ek taraf doctor jahaan ashutosh maharaj ke jism kii jaanch kar unhen pehle hi murda qaraar de chuke hai
 The High Court also believes the same
 aise main hai court ke is nae aadesh ke baad ye maamla pechida ho gaya he
 At least the current situation is similar
 kyonki maharaj ke bhakton ne hai court kaa faisalaa aate hi ashram kii security or bhi zyada kadi kar di he
 There are already scaffolds for security around the institute, in which twenty-four hour ashram security guards have been deployed
 or to or kisi bhi shaks ko bagaiyr talaashi ke ashram ke andar daakhil hone kii ijazat nahin he
 But the situation then becomes more serious
 jab kanoon ke rakhwale yani pulisavaalon kii entry bhi ashram main bain kar di jaati he
 Since the High Court order, the Punjab Police has been continuously trying to go inside the ashram
 lekin nateeja sifar he
 In such a situation, how will the police take out the body of Ashutosh Maharaj from this ashram to the crematorium, this is a big question
 ek khaas baat ye he ki sarkaar ne maharaj kii laash ko hi zed plus security de rakhi he
 In such a situation, if the government wants to remove their corpse from the ashram, then it is necessary to first remove the security cover from their corpse
 or agar cover hataa liya jaataa he, to kya bhakt sidhe sarkaar se takaraane ke liye maharaj ke chaaron ore cover bana kar khadey ho sakate hai?gauratlab he ki samadhi or antim sanskaar kii pench tab uljhi, jab khud maharaj ke bete dilip kumaar jha ne is silsile main hai court main ek yachika daakhil kar apane pita kii laash unhen saunpane kii maang kii
 Jha had said that he should not be deprived of the right to cremate his father
 jis par hai court ne apni muhar laga di
 However, a question between this insistence of the devotees and the decision of the law is also about the legacy and property of Ashutosh Maharaj
 kyonki bahut se log aise hai, jinka ye maananaa he ki ashutosh maharaj kii jaaydaad kii bandarbaant ke liye hi ye sara prapanch rachaa gaya he

 com / uygnc8ttwx bollywood actor shahrukh khan (shah Rukh Khan) in dinon filmon se thodaa dur najar aa rahe hai
 Some time ago rumors about his upcoming films had cropped up, but Shahrukh Khan also cleared that speculation through his tweet
 lekin haal hi main bollywood actor kamaal aar khan ne shahrukh khan or unki filmon ko lekar twit kiya he
 Kamal r Khan said in his tweet that Shah Rukh Khan's films will not run in India unless he does the evil of Pakistan in the film
 shahrukh khan ke liye aayaa kamaal aar khan kaa yah twit khub viral ho rahaa he, saath hi log is par jamkar riection bhi de rahe hai
 No film of SRK will work in India now, if he won't abuse Pakistan in the film
 And if he wants to become super star again then he should be against Pakistan in the film and i have a ready script for him
 He will get national award and film will do 500cr lifetime business at DBO
 kamaal aar khan (kamaal r Khan) ne shahrukh khan (shah Rukh Khan) kii filmon ko lekar twit karte hue likhaa, "shahrukh khan kii koi bhi filmein bharat main tab tak nahin chalengi, jab tak vah film main pakistan kii buraai na karen
 If he has to become a superstar again, he will have to speak against Pakistan and i have a script ready for this
 unhen neshnal aword bhi milegaa or yah box offis par 500 karod rupee kaa bijness bhi karegi
 "please tell that Shah Rukh Khan was last seen in the film Zero
 is film main unke saath anoushka sharma or katrina caff bhi mukhya bhoomika main dikhaai di thim
 However, the film did not perform much at the box office
 iske baad se hi shahrukh khan ne apane kisi apakaming project ko lekar elaan nahin kiya he
 At the same time, talking about Kamal r Khan, the actor entered Bollywood with 'deshrohi'
 is film ke alaava kamaal aar khan (kamaal r Khan) 'big bos 3' main bhi najar aa chuke hai
 The Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided the locations of some suspected hawala dealers in Punjab and 1

 Directorate sources said that intelligence officials raided the locations of two business firms and their associates in Ludhiana and Jalandhar
 sutron ne kaha ki jin logon ke thikaanon par chaape maare gaye hai ve britain, canada, dubai or anya deshon main baithe logon ke nirdesh par bharat main vyapak str par hawala dhan pahunchaate paae gaye
 He said that those whose names were found in the documents seized in the raid would be investigated
 pravartan nideshaalay kaa anumaan he ki punjab or kuch anya uttar bhartiya rajyon main is giroh kaa hawala dhandha 200 karod rupee tak kaa ho saktaa he
 Next time before shaking hands, keep in mind that it can also be dangerous for you
 britain main hue ek shodh main vaigyanikon ne is baat kii pushti kii he ki haath milaane se adhik sankhya main virus transfar hote hai
 Many people do not wash their hands after eating or drinking
 agar aap aise logon se haath milaayenge to inke haathon ke keetanu aapaki taraf transfar ho jaaenge
 This can spread diseases and infections
 kaise he khatra:1
 Shaking hands with each other increases the risk of flu
 flu kii chapet main aae vyakti ke haath main ye khatarnaak virus aksar chipke rahete hai
 When he joins hands with a healthy person, he is also at increased risk of infection due to the transfer of germs
 2
 In case of cough, do not forget to join hands with anyone and avoid shaking hands with anyone who has it
 khansane ke dauraan zyaadaatar log haath munh par rakhte hai, jisase kaph vaale keetanu haath par chipak jate hai
 In such a situation, it can be dangerous for him to join hands with a healthy man
 3
 If someone has chicken pox, don't forget to shake hands
 is beemaari ke virus bahut taqatvar hote hai or aasaani se swasth vyakti ko apni chapet main le lete hai
 4
 haathon ke keetanu pet kharaab hone kii ek badi vajah hote hai
 Sometimes the condition reaches diarrhea
 5
 If the person in front has any contagious disease, avoid shaking hands with him
 varanaa ve keetanu aap par bhi hamalaa bol sakate hai
 The spokesman said that the aircraft was airlifted at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in the evening due to a technical flaw
