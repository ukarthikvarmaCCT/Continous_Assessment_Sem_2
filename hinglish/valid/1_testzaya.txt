 Some magicians, such as Guy Hollingworth and Tom Stone, today begin to challenge the idea that all magical effects can be placed in a limited number of categories

 Some of these are listed below

 paramparaagat rup se, jaadugar apane jaadooi karname ke liye istemaal main aanevaali yuktiyon ke vishay main darshakon ko bataane se inkaar kar dete hai
 The following are the reasons for keeping this secret: peshewar jaaduugaron ke sanghathanon main sadsyta ke liye praaia: jaaduugaron ko gambhirthapurvak apni patibaddhta pradarshit karne ke liye shapath leni padati he ki ve jaaduugaron ke alaava kisi anya vyakti par jaadu kaa raaj nahin prakat karengen
 jaaduugaron ke shapath main antar ho saktaa he lekin ve lagbhag milte julate, nimnlikhit prakaar ke hote hai: Once an oath is taken, the person is considered a magician and is expected to keep this promise
 jo jaadugar kisi karanvash is raaj ko dusron ko bataa detaa he yaa jisase bhulvash yah raaj ujagar ho jaataa he use duusare jaadugar koi anya jaadu sikhaanaa nahin chaahate

 Thus, the secrets of very little magic tricks are unknown, but this does not mean that people have less attraction to magic
 iske atirikt, jaadu ek jeevant kala he or nae-nae kartab saamne aate rahete hai jisase iskaa aakarshan satat kaayam rahata he
 Sometimes some new tricks are inspired by some old tricks which are no longer famous
 kuch jaadugar is sthiti main aa jate hai ki kuch jaadooi kartabon kaa raaj bataa dete hai or is prakaar ve jaadu yaa haath kii safai kii chaturaai ko prakat kar isko or adhik lokapriy banaate hai
 Pan and Taylor are often exposed to how they play the magic game, for example - although they do some new feats almost every time, in the end they reveal how they did it
 praaia: jaadooi kartabon kaa rahasyodghatan maatr duusare prakaar se digbhramit karnaa hi hota he
 For example - magicians explain to a viewer that there is a hole in the linking ring and give two assistants two unlinked rings and that their assistants find that they join as soon as the magician hands it
 yahaan par jaadugar ring main balpurvak apana haath ghusaate hai or daawa karte hai – dekha? ek baar aap samaj len ki sabhi ring main chhed he to yah kartab aasaan lagata he!" Dedication to magic and commitment to this art and work ethic and responsibility related to its use; Faith and creativity comes from it
 jaadu sikhaanaa kisi samay ek gopneey kaary hua karata tha
 To prevent the society or the general public from knowing the secrets of magic, professional magicians did not want to share their knowledge with anyone who is not in this profession
 isse praaia: kisi aise icchhuk prashikshu ko jaadu kii aadharbhoot baaten seekhney main mushkilen aati hai
 In addition to established magicians, there are strict rules prohibiting magicians from revealing magic secrets to others

 a magician usually has to test his magic before joining such a club

 The flip side of the coin is that many artists say that there is no need to sacrifice more than a play or film in one form of theater

 With Ajax, the web application can retrieve data asynchronously from the server in the background, with no interruptions from the display and behavior of the present page
 ajaks takneekon ke upyog ne web pej par interective yaa gatisheel interphes main vruddhi kii he
 The data is usually retrieved using the xmlhttprequest object
 naam ke baavjood javascript or XML kaa upyog vakstav main zaruri nahin hota he, naa hi request ke atulykaalik hone kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Like DHTML and LAMP, Ajax is not a technology in itself, but a set of technologies
 ajaks nimna ke ek sangyojan ko kaam main letaa he: Techniques for asynchronous loading of materials came in the mid-1990s
 java bhashaa ke pehle sanskaran main java amelet kii shuruyaat san 1995 main hui
 These allow compiled client-side code to load data asynchronously after a web page has been loaded
 haalanki, is lakshan ko vyapak rup se tabhi janaa jane laga jab ise Gmail or Google Maps ke dwaara upyog main laayaa gaya
 The term "ajax" came up in 2005
 jesi james garet ke dimag main shabd "ajaks" tab aayaa jab ve naha rahe the, us samay ve ek graahak ke liye praudyogikiyon ke pratinidhitiv ke liye ek sankshipt rup kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahe the
 April 5, 2006 The World Wide Web Consortium released the first draft statement for the object to create an official web standard
 shabd ajaks web praudyogikiyon ke k bade samooh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jinka upyog ek aise web anuprayog ke kriyanvayan ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo prishthbhumi main ek sarwar ke saath sanchaar karata he, is dauraan yah pej kii vartmaan sthiti main koi hastkshep nahin karata he
 In the article where the word Ajax was given, Jesse James Garrett clarified that the following technologies are needed: XML or XSLT
 Since then, there have been many developments in the definition of the word Ajax and the technologies used in the Ajax application
 vishesh rup se yah note kiya gaya he ki: Other languages such as vbscript also deserve the required functionality
 haalankijawa script ajaks programing ke liye sabase lokapriy bhashaa he, kyonki yah adhikansh aadhunik web brouzars ke saath sangat he or unamem shaamil he
 Classical Ajax involves the writing of ad hoc javascript on the client
 ek aasaan or krudar vikalp kaa upyog maanak java script libraries ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo aanshik rup se pej ko apadet karte hai, jaise asp
net kaa apadet panel
 upkaran jaise Echo2 or ZK keval maanak java script libraries kaa upyog karte hue sarwar se ek pej ke fine grand niyantran ko sakasham banataa he
 Material is reloaded on every request, using the traditional methods used
 haalanki, ajaks kaa upyog karte hue, ek web anuprayog keval us saamagree kii request karata he jise apadet kiye jane kii zaroorat hoti he, is prakaar se bandwidth ke upyog or lod ke samay ko bahut adhik kam karata he
 Users make applications faster and more responsive, even when the application has not changed on the server side
 aas paas ke kaaryon main adrishy iframes kaa upyog shaamil he, jo brouzar kii history main parivartan karte hai or URL ke ankar hisse main parivartan karte hai jab ajaks chal rahaa hota he or parivartanon ke liye iskaa niyantran karata he
 Solutions to this problem exist, many of which use the URL fragment identifier to keep track of it and allow the user to return to the application at a given stage
 screen pathakon jo ajaks kaa upyog karne main sakasham he vah gatik rup se utpann saamagree ko thik prakaar se padhne main aksham ho saktaa he
 The only way to make the user work is to go back to the non-javascript method
 This can be done by creating a fixed link, and the forms can be resolved properly and they do not depend only on Ajax
 javascript main iske baad "ritern falls' ke saath form jamaa karne kii prakriya ko galat kiya ja saktaa he
 Developers familiar with other web technologies should learn coding methods and new tests for writing secure Ajax applications

 Latika prevents him from doing so

 Saying this, hurts Salim's heart and breaks him

 One day a worker there asks to sit there for a while, then he searches the names Latika and Salim in the computer's data base
 vah saleem ke sampark main aa jaataa he, us samay tak saleem, javed ke gang kaa vishwasaneey gangester ban jaataa he
 One day Salim calls Jamal to Javed's house near him

 atyadhik ucch-gati vaale leisure printeron kaa prayog nijeekrut dastavejon, jaise credit card yaa suvidha-bilon, ke samuhik preshan ke liye kiya jaataa he or kuch vanijyik anuprayogon main inaki pratispardhaa lithography se he
 The cost of this technology depends on a combination of factors, including the cost of replacement of paper, toner and sometimes drums, as well as other consumables such as the fuser assembly and transfer assembly
 narm plastic drum vaale printers main aksar swaamitv kii laagat ucch ho sakati he, jo tab tak dikhaai nahin padati, jab tak ki drum ke pratisthaapan kii aavashyaktaa na pade
 a duplexing printer can reduce the cost of paper and reduce the volume of the file
 duplexr, jo ki pehle keval ucch shrenee ke printeron main hi uplabdh the, ab madhyam-shrenee ke printeron main bhi aam hai, haalanki sabhi printer ek duplexing ikai ko samahit nahin kar sakate
 duplexing main kagaz ke lambey path ke kaaran prishth-mudran kii gati dhimi bhi ho sakati he
 Compared to laser printers, most ink-jet printers and dot-matrix printers only take an inbound stream of data and publish it directly in a slow jerky process, which can also have some breaks because the printer allows more data Waits to get it
 leisure printer is vidhi se kaary karne main asamarth hota he kyonki itani badi maatra main data ko ek teevr, satat prakriya ke dwaara mudran upkaran tak bhejne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 While waiting for more data to arrive, the printer cannot stop this procedure with sufficient precision without creating a visible-value difference on the printed page or an error in the points' alignment
 isaki bajaay chitra kaa data memory ke ek bade sangrah main rakhaa jaataa he, jo prishth ke prayek bindu ko pradarshit kar paane main sakasham hota he
 This requirement to store all data prior to printing has led laser printers to traditionally be limited to small fixed sizes of paper, such as A4
 adhikansh leisure printers aise akhand binar ko mudrit kar paane main asamarth hote hai, jo kagaz kii do meter lambii shit tak faile hue hon, kyonki mudran kaa prarambh karne se purv itane bade chitra kaa bhandaran karne ke liye printer main paryaapt memory uplabdh nahin hoti
 Laser printers were invented at Xerox in 1969 by researcher Gary Starkweather, who gained an advanced printer functionality by 1971 and incorporated it into a fully functional network printer system nearly a year later
 iskaa prototip puraane xerographic copier main sanshodhan ke dwaara banaaya gaya tha
 Starkweather disabled the illustration system and built a rotating drum with 8 mirror arms on which a laser was focused
 leisure se aane vaala prakaash ghoomte hue drum se takaraayega or copier se guzarate hue prishth par fail jayega
 iskaa hardware keval ek yaa do saptahon main taiyaar kar liya gaya tha, lekin computer interphes or software ko puraa hone main lagbhag 3 maah kaa samay laga
 The first commercial implementation of laser printers was the IBM Model 3800 built in 1976, which was used to print large volumes of documents such as invoices and letter-labels
 aksar iskaa ullekh "ek puraa cameraa lene vaala" ke rup main kiya jaataa he, jo is baat kaa suchak he ki yah personal computer ke saath baad main prayukt parichit upkaran kaa praarambhik sanskaran tha
 Although its size was large, it was built for a completely different purpose
 anek 3800 model aaj bhi upyog main hai
 The first laser printer designed for use in an office system was released in 1981 with the Xerox Star 8010
 yadhyapi yah abhinav tha, lekin star ek mahangaa tantra tha, jise vyapaarik pratishthanon or sansthaaon kii ek apekshaakrit choti sankhya dwaara hi kharida gaya
 After widespread use of personal computers began, the first laser printer released targeting the mass market was the HP Laser Jet 8ppm released in 1984, using a Canon engine controlled by HP software
 HP leisure printer ke baad sheeghra hi brother industries, IBM or anya companiyon ne bhi apane leisure printer prastut kiye
 First-generation machines had large light-sensitive drums, whose circumference was longer than the length of the paper
 ek baar sheeghra-punarprapti coating kaa vikaas kar liye jane par, drum ek hi chakra main kagaz ko anek baar chhu saktaa tha or is prakaar uskaa vyas kam kiya ja saktaa tha
 Like most electronic devices, the cost of laser printers has decreased significantly over the years
 1984 main, HP leisure jet kaa vikray mulya $3500 tha, isamen bahut chote, nimna rijolution vaale chitron ke mudran main bhi samasya aati thi or iskaa bhaar 71 pound tha
 As of 2008, lower-grade monochromatic printers are often sold for less than $ 75
 aksar in printeron main board par prasanskaran kii kami hoti he or ve raster chitra ke nirmaan ke liye mezbaan computer par ashrith hote hai, lekin phir bhi lagbhag sabhi sthitiyon main ve lesuljet clasik se behatar pradarshan karte hai
 The process of laser printing typically involves seven steps: prishth ke paar binduon kii prayek aadi pattica ko ek raster rekha yaa scan rekha kaha jaataa he
 The image to be printed is typically produced by raster image processing built into laser printers
 strot saamagree ko kisi bhi vishesh prishth varnan bhashaa, jaise adob postscript, HP printer command language, yaa microsoft XML pej spacification main athwa apraroopit keval-paathya data ke rup main kutabaddh kiya ja saktaa he
 RIP uses page description language by RIP to create the last page bitmap
 ek baar puraa prishth raster memory main taiyaar kar liye jane par, printer ek satat dhara main kagaz par binduon kaa ek rasterikrut pravaah bhejne kii prakriya kaa prarambh karne ke liye taiyaar hota he
 The first Hulett Packard laser jet had only 128 kilobytes of memory
 vishishtatah iskaa prayog keval paathya saamagree ke mudran ke liye kiya jaataa tha or yah aadhunik chitreey printeron ke samaan sanchalit nahin hota tha
 Page character information was kept in only a few kilobytes, and during printing the actual point for each raster scan line was viewed in the font bitmap tables kept in read only memory
 atirikt font ROM cartrij main rakhe jate the, jise vistaaran slot main joda jaataa tha
 To get a fully graphical result using a page description language, a minimum of 1 megabyte of memory is required to store a single-color letter / A4 size page at 300 dpi
 300 dpi par, prati varg inch main 90,000 bindu hote hai
 a typical 8
5 x 11 sheet of paper has a 0
25-inch margin, reducing the printable area to 8
0 x 10
5 inches or 84 square inches
 84 varg / inch x 90,000 bindu prati varg / inch= 7,560,000 bindu
 is bich 1 megabite=1048576 bits yaa 8,388,608 bits, jo ki 300 dpi ke ek sampurna prishth ko rakhane ke liye paryaapt hota he or raster image procesar dwaara prayog kiye jane ke liye 100 kilobite atirikt sthaan batch jaataa he
 In color printers, each of the four CMYK toner layers is placed as a separate bitmap and all four layers are uniquely processed before printing, so a full-color letter-size page of 300 a minimum of 4 megabytes is required at dpi
 memory aavashyaktaaen dpi ke varg ke saath badhati hai, atah 600 dpi par monocrome ke liye 4 megabitis or 600 dpi par rangeen mudran ke liye 16 megabitis kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Some printers have the capability of dots and interstitial dots of different sizes; These additional features may require several times more memory than the minimum amount described here
 samachar-patr or usase bade aakaar kii kshamta vaale printeron main memory vistaaran slot shaamil ho sakate hai
 If the available memory is insufficient, some features can be disabled, such as the ability to print color in letter size, but only the ability to do one-color printing in newspaper printing
 atirikt memory kharidne par bade aakaar main rangeen printing kii kshamta praapt ho sakati he
 In older printers, a circumferential wire was applied parallel to the drum, or in more recent printers, a primary charge roller, an electrostatic charge photoreceptor, a rotating light-sensing drum or belt, which when dark in its surface
 But is capable of holding an electrostatic charge, but sponsors it
 puraane chitra dwaara chode gayi kisi avshisht aavesh ko hataane ke liye praathmik aavesh roller par ek AC dabaav lagu kiya jaataa he
 The DC will also apply pressure to the surface of the roller drum to ensure the same negative potential
 vaanchit mudran ghanatv is DC dabaav ke dwaara thik kiya jaataa he
 Several patents describe the light-sensitive drum coating as a silicon sandwich with a light-charge layer, an anti-leakage layer, as well as a surface layer
 ek sanskaran acristalia silicon kaa prayog karata he, jisamen prakaash praapt karanevaali parat ke rup main hydrogen, aavesh risaav-rodhi parat ke rup main boron nitrid kaa or saath hi dopit silicon kii sataha parat, ullekhneey rup se oxigen yaa nitrogen ke saath silicon, jo ki paryaapt sandrata main mashining silicon nitrid ke samaan dikhaai detaa he, kaa prayog kiya jaataa he; yah nunatam risaav or ragad ke prati pratirodh ke saath ek prakaash aavesh-ksham diod kaa prabhaav hota he
 The laser is aimed at a rotating polygonal mirror, which sends the laser beam through a system of lenses and mirrors to a photoreceptor
 yah kiran photoriceptor par ek aisa kone banaate hue fail jaati he ki yah failaav puure prishth par ho; silinder is failaav ke dauraan ghumta rahata he or failaav kaa kone is gati kii purti karata he
 The stream of rasterized data held in memory starts and closes the memory to create points on the cylinder
 
 a beam detect sensor is used to synchronize the laser dispersion process at the end of each dispersion cycle
 is adrishy sataha ko toner, kaale carbon yaa rangeen agent ke saath mishrit sookhe plastic powder ke baarik kanon ke saamne ujagar kiya jaataa he
 Charged toner particles are given a negative charge and are electrically attracted to the invisible image of the photoreceptor, the areas touched by the laser
 chunki samaan aavesh ek-duusare kaa pratirodh karte hai, atah rinatmak rup se aaweshit toner drum ko us sthaan par sparsh nahin karegaa, jahaan rinatmak aavesh upasthit he
 The overall blackness of the printed image is controlled by the high voltage applied to the supply toner
 aaweshit toner ek baar drum kii sataha ke antar ko paar kar letaa he, to toner par rinatmak aavesh swatah hi aapurti toner kaa pratirodh karata he or atirikt toner ko drum par jane se roktaa he
 If the voltage is low, only a thin layer of toner is needed to prevent more toner from transferring
 yadi voltage adhik ho, to adhik toner ko drum par sthanantarit hone se rokane ke liye drum par ek patali parat bahut kamazor hoti he
 The excess supply toner continues to move on the drum until the charges on the drum are sufficiently high again to resist the supply toner
 On the blackest setting the voltage of the supply toner is sufficiently high that where the undescribed drum charge is still present, it will also start coating the drum and give a black shadow to the entire page
 photoriceptor ko kagaz par dabaaya yaa chalaaya jaataa he, jisase chitra sthanantarit hota he
 High-grade machines use a positively charged transfer roller on the back of the paper to pull the toner onto the paper from the photoreceptor
 fuzar asembli main kagaz roleron se hokar guzarataa he, jahaan ushma or dabaav plastic powder ko kagaz se jodate hai
 One roller is usually in the form of a poly hose and the other is a rubber supported roller
 ek deeptiman ushma lamp ko poli nalee ke centre main latakaaya jaataa he or isaki infrared urja roller ko samaan rup se bheetar se garm karti he
 The fuser roller must be uniformly heated for proper bonding of the toner
 printer dwaara prayukt vidyut shakti ke 90% tak kaa prayog fuzar roller dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The heat generated by the fuser assembly can damage other parts of the printer, so it is often covered with feathers to remove heat from the interior
 adhikansh coprs or leisure printers kii praathmik vidyut bachat visheshta fuzar ko band karnaa or ise thanda hone dena he
 To regain normal operation, it is necessary to wait until the fuser returns to operating temperature, only then can printing begin
 kuch printer ek bahut patale lacheele dhaatu-nirmit fuzar roller kaa prayog karte hai, atah bahut thode bhaar ko garm karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or fuzar bahut jald prachaalan taapmaana tak pahunch saktaa he
 Doing so speeds up printing from an idle state and also allows the fuser to close more quickly to save power
 yadi kagaz adhik dhimi gati se fuzar se guzarataa he, to toner ko pighalane ke liye roller ke saath adhik sampark samay kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or fuzar ek kam taapmaana par bhi prachaalan kar saktaa he
 This energy-saving design results in smaller, cheaper laser printers, especially slower printing than larger high-speed printers, in which paper passes faster than a high-temperature fuser in very short contact times
 We do
 jab mudran purna ho jaataa he, to ek vidyutiya rup se aaweshit narm plastic blade photoriceptor se atirikt toner ko saaf karti he or ise ek kooda bhandar main jamaa karata he, tathaa ek visarjak lamp bache hue aavesh ko photoriceptor se hataata he
 Toner is sometimes left on the light driver due to any unexpected incidents like paper getting stuck
 toner prakaash-chaalak par lagaae jane ke liye taiyaar he, lekin ise lagu kiye ja sakane se purv hi prachaalan vifal ho jaataa he
 The process should be resumed by removing the toner
 dooshit toner ko mudran ke liye punah prayog nahin kiya ja saktaa kyonki yah dhul or kagaz ke reshon ke kaaran kharaab ho saktaa he
 a quality printed image requires a pure, clean toner
 dooshit toner kaa punarprayog karne ke parinamswaroop dhabbedaar mudran kshetra yaa kagaz par toner kii buree fuzing praapt hoti he
 However, there are some exceptions, most notable in Brother and Toshiba's laser printers, which use a patented method to clean and recycle contaminated toner
 ek baar raster chitra kaa nirmaan puraa ho jane par printig prakriya ke sabhi charan ek teevr anukraman main ek ke baad ek ghatit ho sakate hai
 This allows the use of a very small and compact unit, where the photoreceptor is charged, rotated and scanned to some degree, rotated to a few more degrees and develops, thus continuing the process
 drum kii ek parikrama puri hone se pehle hi is puri prakriya ko purna kiya ja saktaa he
 Different printers perform these steps differently
 kuch "leisure" printer drum par prakaash ko "likhane" ke liye vastutah prakaash-utsarjak dwiyagr kii ek rekhiy shrenee kaa prayog karte hai 
 toner mom yaa plastic par aadhaarit hota he, taaki jab kagaz fuzar asembli se hokar guzarataa he, to toner ke kan pigal jate hai
 Paper may or may not be oppositely charged
 The fuser may be an infrared oven, a heated pressure roller, or a xenon flash lamp
 printer ko pehali baar vidyut shakti pradaan kiye jane par printer ko garm karne ke liye is par lagu kii gai jis warm-ap prakriya se ek leisure printer guzarataa he, usamen mukhyatah fuzar tatv ko garm karnaa shaamil hota he
 Many printers have a toner-rescue mode, called "economode" by hulett-packard, which uses only about half the amount of toner, but produces a lighter, draft-quality result
 rangeen leisure printer rangeen toner kaa prayog karte hai, vishisht rup se harinil, nilaatirakt, pilaa or kaala 
 While monochrome printers use only a laser scanner assembly, color printers often have two or more scanner assemblies
 rangeen mudran ke kaaran mudran prakriya main jatilta judati he kyonki prayek rang ke mudran ke bich acrekhan main bahut kam truti ho sakati he, jise panjiyan truti ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jo anbhipret rang kinare, dhundhalapan, yaa rangeen kshetron ke kinaaron par halki / gahari dhaariyaan utpann karti he
 To allow for higher registration accuracy, some color laser printers use a large rotating lease, known as a "transfer strap"
 sthanantaran patta sabhi toner cartrijon ke saamne se guzarataa he or prayek toner parat ko patte par spasht rup se lagu kiya jaataa he
 The assembled layers are then applied to the paper in a uniform single phase
 rangeen printeron main saamanytah monocrome printeron kii tulana main ek ucch "saint-prati-prishth" utpaadan laagat hoti he
 1200 DPI printers were generally available during 2008
 2400 DPI electrophotographic mudran plate nirmaataa, aavashyak rup se ve leisure printer, jo plastic shiton par mudran karte hai, bhi uplabdh hai
 Most consumer and small commercial laser printers use a toner cartridge, which combines the photoreceptor with toner supply stores, residual toner hoppers, and various wiper blades
 jab toner aapurti kii khapat puri ho jaati he, to toner cartrij ko swachaalit rup se pratisthapit karnaa chithran drum, avshisht toner hoper or viper blades ko pratisthapit kar detaa he
 Some laser printers keep a page-count of the number of pages that have been printed since the last maintenance
 in modelon par, ek samaran-sandesh dikhaai degaa, jo prayokta ko is baat kii soochna degaa ki ab maanak rakrakhaav bhaagon ke pratisthaapan kaa samay aa gaya he
 On other models, no page-count is maintained or no recall message is displayed, so the user has to manually keep a record of the printed pages and look for warning indicators such as paper filling problems and printing errors
 nirmaataa saamanytah printer ke aam bhaagon or upbhogya samagriyon ke liye ek jivan pratyaasha suchi pradaan karte hai
 Manufacturers evaluate the life expectancy for their parts of printers in terms of "expected page-production life" rather than the unit of time
 vyavsaayik-shrenee ke printeron ke liye upbhogya-samagriyaan or rakh-rakhaav bhaagon ko saamanytah vyaktigat printeron ke liye prayukt bhaagon kii tulana main ek ucch prishth-utpaadan pratyaasha ke liye moolyankit kiya jaayegaa
 vishisht rup se, toner cartrij or fuzar kii prishth-utpaadan pratyaasha saamanytah ek vyaktigat printer kii bajaay vyavsaayik-shrenee ke printer main ucchtar hoti he
 Color laser printers require more maintenance and replacement of parts than monochrome laser printers because they contain more image components
 kagaz ko uthaanewaale path or kagaz bharanevaale path main shaamil rolers or asembliyon ke liye, kaarividhi se toner or dhul ko hataanaa or kagaz ko sanbhalanevaale rabar ke rolers ko badalanaa, saaf karnaa or punah lagaana ek vishisht rakh-rakhaav he
 Most pick-up, feed, and separation rollers have a rubber layer, which is ultimately affected by wear and is covered with slippery dust of paper
 jin maamalon main pratisthaapan rolers kaa prayog band kar diya gaya ho yaa ve uplabdh na hon, vahaan rabar ke rolers ko ek ardra roaan-mukt tukade kii sahaayta se surakshit rup se saaf kiya ja saktaa he
 Commercial chemical solutions are also available, which may help temporarily regain rubber traction
 fuzing asembli ko leisure printers par saamanytah ek pratisthapaneey upbhogya purza mana jaataa he
 The fusing assembly is responsible for melting the toner and attaching it to the paper
 fuzing asembliyon ke liye anek trutiyaan sambhav hai: trutiyon main jeern plastic sanchaalan gear, garm karanevaale ghatakon kii electronic vifaltaa, videern phixing film sleeve, jeern dabaav rolers, garm karanevaale rolers or dabaav rolers par toner kaa jamaav, jeern yaa kharoch-yukt dabaav rolers or kshatigrast kagaz samvedak shaamil hai
 Some manufacturers offer protective maintenance kits that are specific to each model of printer; Typically this kit includes a fuser and may also include pick-up rollers, feed rollers, transfer rollers, charge rollers and separation rollers
 anek aadhunik rangeen leisure printers mudrit kaagazon ko pahchaan ke uddeshy se ek lagbhag adrishy bindu raster ke dwaara chinhit karte hai

 Toner particles are made to contain electrostatic characteristics and can develop static-electric charge when rubbed with other particles, objects or transport systems and the internal parts of the vacuum ducts
 is vajah se or kanon ke chote aakaar ke kaaran, toner main nirvaat utpann karne ke liye ek paaramparik gharelu vaikum clinar kaa prayog nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Stagnant discharge from charged toner particles can burn dust in a vacuum cleaner bag or create a small explosion if enough toner is aerated
 yah vaikum clinar ko kshatigrast kar saktaa he yaa aag utpann kar saktaa he
 Additionally, toner particles are so fine that they cannot be filtered properly by the filter bags of traditional household vacuum cleaners and can fly through the motor or return to the room
 garm hone par toner ke kan pighalate hai
 Minor spills of the toner can be wiped with a cold, damp cloth
 yadi toner leisure printer ke bheetar chhalak jaae, to ise prabhavi dhang se saaf karne ke liye ek vidyutiya rup se aaweshit nalee or ek ucch dakshata vaale filter se yukt ek vishesh prakaar ke vaikum clinar kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he

 In spite of the many non-decimal powers in English and the accessibility of names for Great Gross, no English name describes hexadecimal powers
 kuch log hexadesimal sankhyaon ke ek-ek ank ko ek phone number kii tarah padhate hai: 4DA ko "four-di-e" padhate hai
 However, a sounds like the letter "at", c sounds like "three", and d can easily sound like the "-ty" suffix: is it 4D or forty? Others avoid getting confused by using the NATO phonetic alphabet: 4DA is "four-delta-alpha"; Or Joint Army / Navy Phonetic Alphabet; Or a similar ad hoc system

 In the hexadecimal system negative numbers can be expressed in the same way as the decimal system: –2A to represent –42 and so on
 haalanki, iske bajaay kuch log procesar main istemaal kiye jane vaale sateek bit pattern ko vyakt karnaa pasand karte hai or hexadesimal maanon ko sanketit maanon ke rup main hi sabase acchhee tarah sanbhale jane kaa vichaar rakhte hai
 In this way, the negative number -42 can be written as xxrep 4 f FFD6 in a 32-bit CPU register as C228 xxrep 4 0 in a 32-bit FPU register, or C045 xxrep 4 0 xxrep 4 0 in a 64-bit FPU register
 Can be written as xxrep 4 0 
 adhikansh computer binary data main pher-badal karte hai, lekin ek apekshaakrit choti binary sankhya ke liye bhi anginat ankon ke saath kaam karnaa insaanon ke liye mushkil he
 Although most humans are familiar with the base 10 system, it is quite easy to map a binary in hexadecimal compared to a decimal
 is udhaaharan xxrep 4 1 2 ko aadharank das main roopantarit kar detaa he
 Since each space of a binary number can have either 1 or 0, its value can be easily determined by its position from the right: isliye: With surprisingly little practice, it becomes easy to map xxrep 4 1 2 to F16 in one step: see table of performance of hexadecimal
 The benefit of using hexadecimal instead of decimal leads to a rapid increase in the size of the number
 jab sankhya bahut badi ho jaati he, to ise dashamalav main roopantarit karnaa bahut kathin ho jaataa he
 However, when mapping hexadecimal, it becomes negligible to recognize binary strings as 4-digit groups and map each to a single hexadecimal digit
 yah udhaaharan dashamalav main ek binary sankhya ke roopantaran ko dikhaata he, prayek ank ko dashamalav maan main map karata he or parinaamon ko jodta he
 Compare this to the conversion done in hexadecimal, where each four-digit group can be freely considered and directly converted: hexadesimal se binary main kiya jane vaala roopantaran bhi utana hi pratyaksh hota he
 The octal system can also be used as an instrument for people directly encountering binary computer data

 As with all bases, the source base has a simple algorithm for modifying the display of a number in hexadecimal by dividing it into integers and performing the remaining operations
 saidhantik rup se yah kisi bhi aadharank se sambhav he lekin adhikansh insaanon ke liye keval dashamalav or adhikansh computaron ke liye keval binary ko is tareeke se badi aasaani se sambhala ja saktaa he
 Let us assume b to be the number displayed in hexadecimal and hihi-1

 The conversion function can also be performed by providing a hexadecimal display of each place value in the source base and then adding and multiplying it to get the final performance
 arthath B3AD sankhya ko dashamalav sankhya main roopantarit karne ke liye koi bhi is roopantaran ko D, A, 3 or b main vibhajit kar saktaa he or uske baad prayek dashamalav pradarshan ko 16p se guna karke antim parinaam praapt kar saktaa he, jahaan 'p' daaen se baayen anukool sthiti he jo 0 se shuru hota he
 In this case we get 13 * + 10 * + 3 * + 11 * which is equal to 45997 in the decimal system
 graphical yujar interphes vaali sabase aadhunik computer pranaliyaan ek antarnirmit calculator utility pradaan karti hai jisamen vibhinn mulaankon ke bich roopantaran karne kii kshamta hoti he jisamen aam taur par hexadesimal bhi shaamil hota he
 In Microsoft Windows, the calculator utility can be set to scientific calculator mode, which allows conversion between radix 16, 10, 8 and 2; Basis most commonly used by programmers
 In scientific mode, the on-screen numeric keypad contains hexadecimal digits from a to f that become active when "hex" is selected
 hex mod main, tathaapi, windos calculator keval purnankon kaa samarthan karata he
 As with other numerical systems, the hexadecimal system can be used to represent rational numbers, although recurring digits are common because sixteen has only a single prime factor: jahaan ek overline ek aavarti paddati ko suchit karata he
 For any base, 0
1 is always equal to that divided by the performance of that base value in its own number system: the count of base 3 is 0, 1, 2, 10
 is prakaar, chaahe binary ke liye ek ko do se vibhajit kiya jaae yaa hexadesimal ke liye ek ko solah se vibhajit kiya jaae, inamen se donon gunankhandon ko 0
1 hi likhaa jaataa he
 Since radix 16 is a perfect square, the odd term of the multiplication clause expressed in hexadecimal is often much greater than the multiplication clause expressed in decimal and is not a cyclic number
 aavarti ank tab pradarshit hote hai jab sabase nichle padon ke har main ek abhajya gunan khand hota he jo mulank main nahin miltaa he; is prakaar, hexadesimal notesan kaa istemaal karte samay, har ke saath sabhi gunan khand, jo do ke ghaat nahin hai, aavarti ankon ke ek inparimit string main parinat ho jate hai
 This makes hexadecimal less convenient than decimals for displaying rational numbers because a much larger portion remains outside the range of finite display
 hexadesimal main parimit taur par pradarshneey sabhi tarksangat sankhyaayein, dashamalav, duodesimal or sexajesimal main bhi parimit taur par pradarshneey hoti hai: arthath, ankon kii ek parimit sankhya ke saath koi bhi hexadesimal sankhya main ankon kii ek parimit sankhya hoti he jab inhen un anya mulaankon main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 In contrast, a multiplication clause that is finitely visible only in the latter evaluations is finitely representable in hexadecimal
 udhaaharan ke liye, dashamalav 0

 However, hexadecimal is more efficient than 12 and 60 values to represent multiplication blocks with the power of two in the denominator

 The word hexadecimal is made up of the words hexa- and -desimal of which the word hexa is derived from the Greek word έξ which is used for "six" and the Latin word used for the -desimal word "tenth"

 Hexadecimal is sometimes used in programmer jokes because some words can only be formed using hexadecimal digits
 inamen se kuch shabd "ded", "bif", "beb" or upyukt pratisthaapan ke saath "coffee" hai
 Since programmers can detect these immediately, debugging setups sometimes turn on memory for programmers to help programmers see when a task has not started
