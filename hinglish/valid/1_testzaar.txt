 magar lokanaty shilp se bhi adhik naatak kaa yah rup adhik gahare sochane ko vivash karata he
 Ghasiram speaks directly to the audience, to deepen the effect which is contrary to Brecht, because here Ghasiram does not obstruct the narrative, nor does he seek to erase the effect
 yaheen rudh lokanaty se bhinn shilp kaa prayog tendulkar ne kiya he
 Historical authenticity was not urged in costumes, this also influenced the folk style

 When any anti-law or anti-social act is done by a child, it is called juvenile crime or child crime

 According to the Juvenile Justice Act 1986 in India, boys and girls up to 18 years of age have been included in the category of juvenile delinquency
 bal aparaadh kii adhiktam aayu seemaa alag-alag rajyon me alag-alag he
 On this basis, anti-legal work done by a child under the age limit set by any state is child crime
 keval aayu hi bal aparaadh ko nirdhaarit nahin karti varan isamen aparaadh kii gambhirtha bhi mahatvapurn paksh he
 No crime has been committed by a 7 to 16 year old boy and a girl between 7 and 18 years of age, for which the state gives death penalty or life imprisonment such as murder, treason, fatal attack etc
, then it will be considered as a child criminal
 samajashastreey drushtikon se bal aparaadh ke liye aayu ko adhik mahatv nahin diya jaataa kyonki vyakti kii maansik evam saamaajik paripakvata sadaa hi aayu se prabhavit nahin hoti, atah kuch vidwaan, balak dwaara prakat vyavhaar pravriti ko bal aparaadh ke liye aadhaar maanate hai, jaise aawaragardee karnaa, skool se anupasthit rahanaa, mata-pita evam sangrakshakon kii ajna na maananaa, ashleel bhashaa kaa prayog karnaa, charitraheen vyaktiyon se sampark rakhana aadi
 But until a valid method is unanimously accepted, age will be considered as the determinant of child crime

 In this way, child crime is taken against the antisocial behavior of children or the behavior of children which is detrimental to public welfare, is known as child criminal
 robinsan ke anusaar aawaragardee, bheekh maanganaa, niruddeshy idhar-udar ghoomana, udandta bal apradhi ke lakshan he
 On the basis of the above definitions, a child who disobeys the law and conducts anti-social behavior is a child criminal, as Newmeyer states that a child criminal is a person under a certain age who has done a criminal act and whose abuse is breaking the law

 Anthropologists have concluded that crime is related to inheritance, physical structure and caste characteristics
 isi kaaran apradhi jati ke sabhi vyakti ek hi jatigat visheshtaon or ek si shaareerik banaavat ke hote hai tathaa ve ek sa aparaadh karte hai

 The series is a general entertainment program for all age groups
 iske nirmaataa anematrix, oysis films or intra-vijan productions he or iske nirdeshak the dhruv sahagal
 Due to the conspiracies of Rajguru on Tenaliram, Rajguru is in the role of villain in the program and the program revolves around his conspiracies
 raajaguru, tenaliram ke aane se purv maharaja krishandevaraay ke priy the kintu ab tenaliram maharaja kii pray he
 Now Rajguru can do anything to make Tenaliram fall in the eyes of Maharaj
 raajaguru ke jivan ke ek maatr uddeshy he, tenaliram kii haar
 In every issue of the first season, May Rajguru, together with his friend Defense Minister and Treasurer, thinks of such a move that can harm Tenaliram
 par chatur tenaliram na sirf bachataa he balki maharaja se kai kai inaam bhi paa letaa he
 In the program, Tenali's unique ability to solve complex cases within the moment and her knowledge is well illustrated

 par carnelia to ek junun kaa naam tha
 Due to his talent, he started giving legal advice to women and raised the demand to open a profession of advocacy for women
 Finally, after 1907, Cornelia was given the post of assistant female advocate in the courts of Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Assam
 ek lambi jaddojahad ke baad 1924 main mahilaon ko vakaalat se rokane vaale kanoon ko shithil kar unke liye bhi yah pesha khol diya gaya

 Large boats which have been used since ancient times for the movement of sea and travel to distant countries, are called ships
 pehle jahaaj apekshaakrit chote hote the tathaa lakdi ke banate the
 In the modern period of technological and scientific progress, very large, mainly iron-made and engine-driven ships are made
 jis jahaaj se jo bhi kaam liya jaataa he
 Accordingly, it is designed and constructed
 at: kaary ke anusaar jahaajon ko teen virgon main baantate hai : They also have several subclasses, which are further described in chronological order below
 is varg main duubate hue jahaajon ko nikaalanevaale pot samudri taar bichaane tathaa unki marammat karanevaale, tatavarti yatropayogi chote jahaaj, bhojan saamagree le janevaale, matsay naukaaye or ghat-yaan-naukaaye aadi mukhya hai
 The structure of each ship is designed in such a way that its engines, propellants or paddle wheels, assistive devices and punches, etc
, bear the distortions and stresses caused by them, especially due to sea waves
 jahaajon ke chalate samay jab saamne kii hawa kaa mukaabila karnaa hota he
 At that time, if long waves equal to the width of the ship begin to rise, then a single large wave of plum can lift the ship in the balance in the middle
 tab jahaaj ke aage or peeche k sire thik usee prakar se latakate rahenge jaise ki kisi ladi hui shateer ko bich main se sahaara dekar uthaa liya ho
 This condition of the ship is called convexity
 kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki jahaaj kaa aage or peeche kaa sira to laharon par tik jaataa he or bich kaa sthaan khaali ho jaataa he, thik vaisaa hi jaise koi ladi hui shateer donon siron par tiki ho
 In this situation, the stresses on the structure of the ship are called concave
 kabhi kabhi in donon paristhitiyon kaa mishran bhi ho jaataa he, jisamen padanevaale pratibal kartan kehalaate hai
 When the wind moves diagonally, sometimes there are torsional forces in the structure of the ship
 jab bagali hawa chalati he tab parshviya vikrutiyaan utpann hoti hai
 Apart from this, excessive pressure of sea water on the submerged part also shows a tendency to stick to the structure
 sabase adhik tathaa vikat prakaar kii vikrutiyaan to aage or peeche ke siron par us samay paidaa hoti hai jab jahaaj main maal ke visham ladaan or laharon ke prabhaav tathaa pani ke utplavak bal ke kaaran jagah jagah par naman ghurna paidaa hone lagate hai
 When calculating the deformations caused by the waves, it is assumed that the length of each wave is equal to the width of the ship and their height is about one-third of the length
 jahaaj ke dhaanche kii abhiklpana karte samay uske prayek avyav kii rachana aisi karte hai ki usapar jo bhi pratibal pade, sab main samavibhajit hokar is prakaar se samast dhaanche main fail jaae ki prayek avyav par aanevaale jhatkon ko avyav milakar sah len

 suryoday or suryaast ke bich jab bhi badali, koharaa aadi nahin hote, tab focus padi hui kirane patrak ko samuchit sthaan par jala detii hai
 The diode is a junction of a p type semiconductor and an n type semiconductor, so the diode is also called a PN junction diode
 jaisaa kii ham jaanate hai ki p tip semiconductor main hole ki adhikta rahati he or n tip semiconductor main electrons kii
 We also know that the opposite charged particles attract each other and the goods are repulsed
 Since electrons are negatively charged particles and hole positive, when we combine both types of semiconductor, the electrons and holes attract each other
 kuch samay baad donon kaa aakarshan simit ho jaataa he or jankshan ke paas electrons or hole kii parat ban jaati he or use ham deplation rigen kehete hai
 a diode is a bipolar device meaning it has both negative and positive sides
 yahan aap diod kii banaavat or uskaa electronic simbol dekh sakate hai
 In this the anode denotes negative and cathode positive ends
 diod main karant ke pravaah ke liye hamen use kisi voltage sorce se jodna padataa he jaise kii bydaree
 jaisaa kii ham jaanate hai ki bydaree main bhi negative or posetive donon chor hote hai isliye diod ko ham bydaree ke saath do tarah se jod sakate hai or in tareekon ko ham bisingh kehete hai
 When we connect battery k to diode and battery k to diode, it is called forward biasing and when we connect battery k to diode and battery k to diode, it is called reverse biasing
 ab aap dhyaan den kii jab ham diod ko forward bisingh main jodate hai to bydaree kaa sira holes ko vikarshith karata he or thik usee tarah bydaree kaa sira electrons ko vikarshith karata he
 In this way the current flows from the diode
 karant hameshaa se kii ore pravaahit hota he
 But when we add the diode to reverse biasing, the end of the battery attracts the electrons and the end of the battery attracts the holes and the current does not know
 You should always keep in mind that if we have to make current flow through the diode, then it has to be connected in forward bias and if current has to be stopped then it has to be connected in reverse bias

 pushpakavimaan hindu puranic mahakavy ramayana main varnit vaayu-vaahan tha
 In this, King Ravana of Lanka used to travel
 isi vimaan kaa ullekh sita haran prakaran main bhi miltaa he
 According to the Ramayana, after the rama-ravana war, Sri Ram, Sita, Lakshmana and newly-announced King Vibhishana of Lanka and many others came to Ayodhya from Lanka
 yah vimaan multah dhan ke devtaa, kuber ke paas hua karata tha, kintu ravan ne apane is chote bhrata kuber se balpurvak uski nagari suvarnmandit lankapuri tathaa ise chin liya tha
 As mentioned in other texts, the form and construction method of Pushpak Vimana was done by Angira Rishi and its construction and decoration was done by dev-shilpi Vishwakarma
 bharat ke pracheen hindu granthon main lagbhag das hajaar varsh purv vimaanon evam yudhon main tathaa unke prayog kaa vistrut varnan diya he
 Ravana's Pushpak Vimana is found in abundance in it
 iske alaava anya sainik kshamtaaon vaale vimaanon, unke prayog, vimaanon kii aapas main bhidant, adrishy hona or peechha karnaa, aisa ullekh miltaa he
 There are mainly two categories of ancient planes - the first manned aircraft, which used to fly with wings like modern aircraft, and the second amazing aircraft, which were not man-made, but they are shaped like modern flying plates
 Used to be consistent with is vimaan main bahut si visheshtaayen thim, jaise iskaa aakaar aavashyaktaanusaar chota yaa bada kiya ja saktaa tha
 It could be run unlimited at the speed of your mind to travel anywhere
 yah nabhchar vaahan hone ke saath hi bhoomi par bhi chal saktaa tha
 The aircraft had the ability to ride a large number of people with the speed as per the will of the owner
 yah vimaan yatriyon kii sankhya or vaayu ke ghanatv ke hisaab se swayamev apana aakaar chota yaa bada kar saktaa tha
 Because the aircraft was able to travel in the sky according to the wishes of its master, it was also given to its lord Kubera to travel to the gods
 ek baar ravan ne kuber se uski nagari lankapuri evam yah yah vimaan balpurvak chin liya tha, tabhi kuber ne vartmaan tibet ke nikat nayi nagari alakapuri kaa nirmaan karavaaya
 After the slaughter of Ravana, Lord Rama returned it to its original lord Kubera after a single experiment
