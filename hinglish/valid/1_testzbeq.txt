 'totalitarianism' as a type of political system is a term that seems to be synonymous with positions like autocracy, totalitarianism and dictatorship

 He showed that the anti-semitism campaign gained new strength due to the distinct political and social status of the Jews; Feminist movements arose because of imperialism; And because of the split in the uprooted communities of European society, it became easy to mobilize the victims of loneliness and directionlessness through ideologies

 Scholars studying comparative governance Carl Friedrich and Zigniu Brzezinski defined the definition of totalitarianism as an ideology covering every sphere of life, a party ruled state, intelligence police dominance, and government on economic-cultural-promotional structure As a coincidence of the grip

 In such societies, only military rule can maintain the disturbing effects emanating from the process of modernization while maintaining peace and order

 This formulation, which calls military dictatorship as the bearer of democracy, was the experience of undemocratic rule over poor countries

 Sociologists observed that between 1964 and 1974, totalitarian rule was underway not only in the relatively developed countries of Latin America, but in the rich countries like Spain and Portugal

 In finance, the capital asset pricing model is used to determine the desired return rate theoretically appropriate for a capital asset when this asset is to be added to an already well-managed portfolio, and while that asset is Bad risks are known
 is model main parisampatti ke ashaakhneey jokhim jise vitt kshetra main praayah 'beta' ke dwaara pradarshit kiya jaataa he, ko gananaa main liya jaataa he tathaa bazaar ke pratyaashit pratilabh va saidhantik jokhim-mukt parisampatti ke pratyaashit pratilabh ko bhi
 CAMP suggests that the cost of share capital of an investor is determined by 'beta'
 ”:2 is model kaa vistrut rup dwi-beta model he, jo ki urdhvagami beta ko adhigami beta se bhinn karata he
 The concept of CPM was independently presented by Jack Treynor, William Sharpe, John Leintner and Jan Mosin, expanding the work done earlier by Harry Markowitz on diversification and modern portfolio theory
 1990 main shorpe, marcovitz va martan miller ko sanyukt rup se vittiya arthshaastra main yogadan ke liye nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 Fisher Black developed another version of the CPM, the blackcapm, or the zero-beta CPM, which rejected the recognition of risk-free assets i went
 empirical testing main yah sanskaran adhik drudh tha tathaa siepiem kii vaishvik sweekruti main iskaa prabhavi yogadan rahaa
 Despite the advent of many modern methods of pricing and portfolio selection and arbitrage empirical flaws, CAPM is still more prevalent due to its generality and usefulness in a wide variety of circumstances
 siepiem kisi akeli parisampatti athwa parisampattiyon ke samooh kii keemat nirdhaaran karne ke liye ek model he
 For a single security, we use the securities market line and its relationship with expected return and systemic risk to determine how much the price of a single market will be determined by the market compared to its risk category
 pratibhuti bazaar rekha se kisi ek sampatti kii puure bazaar kii tulana main pratifal-jokhim anupaat kii gananaa bhi kii ja sakati he
 Hence, as the expected return of an asset will decrease by its beta coefficient, the return-risk ratio of this single asset will be equal to the return-risk ratio of the entire market
 is prakaar: The market-to-risk ratio is effectively the market risk premium / premium and by re-employing the above equation and assuming E, we get the capital asset pricing model
 jahaan: If this is rewritten from the risk premium point of view, we find that: arthath kisi parisampatti kaa "apana jokhim premium"- "bazaar jokhim premium" va "beta" kaa gunanfal he
 Note 1: The expected market returns are often estimated by taking a geometric average of the value of historical returns in a market-portfolio
 note 2: jokhim kii gananaa hetu prayukt 'jokhim mukt pratifal dar' praayah etihasik daron kaa arithmetic ausat hota he naa ki vartmaan dar
 For the full derivation see Modern portfolio theory
 siepiem ko amaap adhivetan or vishisht jokhim shaamil karne ke liye sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 This is important for investors who do not have an advanced-diversified portfolio
 sameekaran parmparik siepiem sameekaran ke samaan hi he “jisamen bazaar jokhim adhivetan ko beta utpaa or bazaar jokhim adhivetan ke guna se pratisthapit kar diya gaya he:”:5 "where: pratibhuti bazaar rekha siepiem ke formula kaa graph ke rup main chithran karti he
 show the risk on the x axis and the expected return on the y axis
 bazaar jokhim kaa anumaan pratibhuti bazaar rekha kii dhalaan se lagaaya jaataa he
 The relationship between β and expected return is depicted on the securities market line, which represents the expected return as a function of β
 The intercept is the bazaar main uplabdh nominal jokhim mukt dar he, jabaki dhalaan market premium he, E− Rf
 It can be said that the securities market line represents as a single-factor model of the asset price, while β shows how likely it is to be affected by market changes, thus the SML equation is : aisi paristhitiyon ke liye yah ek ati mahatvapurn tul he jab pataa karnaa ho ki kya koi parisampatti / pratibhuti jokhim kii tulana main ek sweekaarya pratifal degi ki nahin
 Solitary assets are depicted on the securities market line graph
 yadi jokhim va pratifal kaa paraspar chithran rekha se upar hota he to iskaa arth he ki yah pratibhuti sasti mil rahi he or is par adhik laabh kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 If it falls below the illustration line, then the price should be considered expensive and it will not get as much profit as the risk is being taken
 siepim kaa upyog karte hue pratyaashit / vaanchhit labhdar e { \ displaystyle E} gyaat hone ke pashchaat isaki tulana sampatti ke anumaanit pratilabh dar se karke yah pataa laga sakate hai ki yah nivesh acha rahegaa ki nahin
 For this we will need to calculate an independent estimate of the return on assets, which is usually done by fundamental or technical analysis, proportional analysis, etc
 siepiem ke anusaar, yadi anumaanit mulya, sampatti ke siepiem dwaara sujhai dar ke saath samyojit kiye gaye bhavishya nakadapravaah ke baraabar he - to sampatti sahi mulya par mil rahi he
 If the estimated value is higher than the CAPM valuation, the property is cheaper
 kisi parisampatti kaa pratibhuti bazaar rekha par sthit nahin hona uske mulya main visangati ko darshata he
 Since the expected return of the property at timepoint t { \ displaystyle t} is e = e - p t p t { \ displaystyle e = { \ frac {E-P_ {t}} {P_ {t xxrep 5 } as suggested by the CAPM If the return exceeds, it means that p t { \ displaystyle P_ {t}} is too low, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t + 1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 siepiem kaa prayog karne par parisampatti kaa mulya p 0 { \ displaystyle P_{0}}, nimna leniyar sambandh se pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he: Where PT { \ displaystyle P_ {T}} is the payoff of the asset or portfolio
 siepiem dwaara pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki kisi vishisht sampatti ke tulanaatmak jokhim ko dhyaan main rakhte hue uski apekshit vaapasi arthath samaayojan dar, kitni honi chahie
 If the value of beta is more than one, it means - above average risk; Less than one means - below average risk
 is prakaar, kisi zyada jokhim vaale stock kaa beta adhik hoga or unhen adhik dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 Whereas less sensitive stocks will have lower beta and will be adjusted at a lower rate
 yah prachlit anaupchaarik dharna, ki adhik jokhim lene vaale niveshak adhik pratifal kii ichha rakhte hai, ke anuroop hi he
 Because beta is the measure of the vulnerability of a single asset to full market risk, it is clear from the definition that beta will be a measure of market risk: 1
 bazaar jokhim maapne ke liye ek poorak paimaane ke rup main stock market index kaa prayog bahutayat main kiya jaataa he, atah inkaa beta maap 1 hota he
 Thus, investors of a large and well-defined portfolio can expect results from their investments according to market movements
 kisi bhi portpholio main maujuud jokhim pramukhtah do prakaar ke jokhimon kaa yoga hota he - vyavasthaatmak jokhim, jise bazaar jokhim yaa ashaakhneey jokhim bhi kaha jaataa he, tathaa avyavashthaatmak jokhim jise shaakhneey jokhim kaha jaataa he
 Systematic or market risk is due to the factors that affect all investment options, ie the entire market
 is prakaar ke jokhim par niyantran karnaa kathin he
 Disorganized risk is the risk that affects a particular security or investment option
 nivesh kaa vishaakhan karke aise jokhim ko niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context — ie its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness — as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance ie less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 siepiem maanata he ki kisi nivesh ke jokhim-pratifal anupaat ko durust kiya ja saktaa he, ek adarsh portpholio vah hoga jo ki ek nirdhaarit pratifal dar ke liye nunatam jokhim ke saath ho
 Additionally, as each new asset added to the portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above
 All such optimal portfolios, ie, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 An investor can also invest some part of his fund in risky assets and save some cash, which can be earned at a risk-free rate
 
 Here the ratio of risky and risk free does not determine the overall return - this relationship is definitely linear
 is prakaar se yah sambhav he ki nimna don main se kisi ek prakaar ek nishchit return praapt kiya ja saktaa he : However for a fixed return, only one of the above options would prove to be efficient
 chunki jokhimamukt sampatti paribhaashatah kisi bhi anya sampatti se correlated nahin he, dwitiya vikalp main saamanytah kam vichlan hoga jiske kaaran yah donon main se adhik kushal hoga
 This relationship would also hold true for other portfolios on the effective range: some cash with a higher return - is more efficient - rather than just a portfolio with lower returns at the same return rate
 ek nishchit jokhimamukt dar ke liye, ek hi kushal portpholio hoga jise ki nakadi ke saath milakar kisi bhi pratilabh ke liye nunatam jokhim kii sthiti praapt kii ja sakati he
 This is the market portfolio
 sabhi niveshkon: The bi-beta model distinguishes the upward beta from the overlying beta
 siepiem tathaa dwi-beta model main antar yah he ki siepiem model kii manyata he ki urdhvagami or adhigami beta ek hi hai jabaki dwi-beta model esa nahin maanata
 AC validation is rarely correct, so a bi-beta model is considered more appropriate

 The purpose of telling jokes is to create banter
 kintu kinhin kaarnon se jab aisa nahin ho paata to kabhi-kabhi chutkule kaa hi majaak uda diya jaataa he
 Psychologists and researchers on literature have studied this question very deeply as to why people laugh jokingly at jokes
 is vishay ko lekar bahut se sookshm prashn saamne aate hai, jaise ki aisa kyon he ke ek hi chutkula jab ek aadmi sunaaye to log hanste hai lekin doosraa sunaaye to nahin hanste? yah mana jaataa he ke kai chutkulon main tanaav ke utaar-chadhaav kaa bahut mahatvapurn yogadan he
 Like a joke that - is latife main shuru main paaglon ke bhaag uthne se tanaav paidaa hota he
 And then it seems that it is not crazy at all, so the tension is reduced but a little bit of strength remains
 or phir ekadam se tanaav phir se bhadak uthta he
 In any case, it is important that this fluctuation of stress seems to be accidental, that is, where tension is expected to increase, it will reverse and where it seems likely to decrease, it will go up
 achche chutkula sunaane vaale is tanaav ke bahaav ko apane niyantran main rakhte hai
 There is not much fluctuation of tension in some Latifas, but in them also there is something contrary to expectation which will be startled in a satirical manner

 Therefore, Holi festival is thanks to future harvest
 holi shabd se liya gaya he ateet jo raashi holikaa maut ke liye khud ko jala diya jab uske bhai kii jalane kii koshish kar uski god main prahlada hai
 prahlada-puri temple and Holika Dahan Prahlada was a devotee of the Hindu god Vishnu
 uski bhakthi apane ugr pita hiranyakashyap koun multan kaa raja tha dwaara pareekshan kiya gaya tha
 As a result of his devotion, he was given special powers by Lord Vishnu

 He took Prahlada on his lap and offered the choice to enter the fire
 is tarah se prahlada, jala diya he, jabaki holikaa use shawl dwaara sangrakshit rahegaa
 Legend has it that when he entered the fire, a strong wind blew and the protective shawl covered it instead of Holika Prahlada
 punjab main holi holi se pehle raat main holikaa kaa putala kaa pratik jal ke saath shuru hota he or holikaa dahan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 While the fire went to pick up Holika, Lord Vishnu appeared as Narasimha and punched on Hiranyakashipu, cutting him into two pieces

 17veen shatabdi ke madhya main francisi ganitagya rene dekart ne jyamiti main bijganit kaa prayog kar ise bahut shaktishaalee bana diya
 He first took two cutting lines, called axes
 kisi bindu kii in rekhaon ke samaantar naapi hui duuri do sankhyaon ya r se uskaa sthaan nishchay kiya
 These lines are called the coordinates of the point
 in nirdeshaankon kii sahaayta se prayek jyamitiya tathy ko bijaganitiya sameekaran dwaara pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he
 This geometry developed in many directions
 pehali dasha main to jyamiti kaa vyapak rup saamne aayaa, jaise ek ghaat kaa sameekaran ek saral rekha pradarshit karata he
 Similarly, the equation of two powers represents a conic
 isi prakaar teen, chaar or ucchtar ghaaton ke samikarnon kaa adhyayan hone laga or unke sangat vakron ke gunon kaa vivechan pehle se bahut saral ho gaya
 It became possible to study not only the curves of the floor but also the curves of the recess
 iske liye ek bindugami teen samatalon se kisi bindu kii duriyon ya r l na uskaa sthaan nishchit karte hai or prayek bindupath ko ya, r, l main ek sameekaran dwaara pradarshit karte hai
 By considering these equations, the properties of the planes and curves are easily studied
 duusari disha main rachana sambandhi prashnon kaa hal tathaa kriyaayein bahut saral ho gayi
 These verbs depend only on the solution of some equations, in which very broad questions are easily solved; For example, if the line intersects a curve = o, the solution of both these equations will determine the location of their intersection points
 yadi in samikarnon ke mul vaastavik hai, to rekha vakr ko katati he
 If equal, the line touches the curve
 yadi kaalpanik hai to rekha vakr ko nahin katati, parantu ham yah kah sakate hai ki rekha vakr ko sadaiv do binduon par kaategi, chaahe bindu vaastavik yaa sampati hon, athwa kaalpanik hon
 Similarly, facts can be given in a very broad form, which was not possible in ordinary geometry
 teesri disha main nirdeshaank jyamiti ne vimiti ko vyapak kiya
 Two numbers Y, r in two dimensions and three numbers determine the position of a c point in three dimensions 
 ab ganitagyon ke saamne yah prashn uthaa ki chaar sankhyaayein ya, r, l, va yaa paanch sankhyaayein ya, r, l, va, ha kya pradarshit karengi
 Mathematicians thought very easily in their minds that abstract four numbers would determine the position of a point in four dimensions and five numbers in five dimensions
 is prakaar unhone sa vimitiyon kaa vichaar bhi acchhee tarah soch liya
 He does not mean whether there is any example of him in the earthly world
 instine ne avashya is vichaar kaa apane saapeksh siddhant main upyog kiya or vimiti ke vichaar kaa spashtikaran kiya
 Now use this idea of high dimensionality to solve some difficult problems in untapped mathematics
 jaise kisi chal taral padaarth ke bhinn bhinn kanon kaa sthaan, saat sankhyaon se pradarshit karte hai
 They are A, B, C, its initial position, and three velocities, which are parallel to Y, R, l axis, and time, this can be solved by considering the question of seven dimensions
 chauthi disha main nirdeshaank jyamiti ne sankhyaon kaa vyapkikaran kiya or kaalpanik sankhyaon kaa aavirbhaav hua
 Concepts such as hypothetical points and imaginary curves, etc
, made geometry very important, which further helped in generalization, such as the conic circle going from two imaginary points at infinity, etc
 iske atirikt jyamiti kaa vivechan bhinn bhinn prakaar ke nirdeshaankon kii sahaayta se hone laga, jaise samghaateey nirdeshaank, trikoniya nirdeshaank, sparsheey nirdeshaank ityadi
 According to Hatha Yoga, one of the hexes in the spine within the body is named Anahata
 iskaa sthaan hriday-pradesh he
 It is a lotus-like present of red-yellow mixed colored parties and has letters from "A" to "TH"
 iske devtaa rudra hai
 The word Brahman, which is spread in the whole universe in the form of wide sound and has the sound of melodious music
 europe ke pracheen darshanikon ko bhi iske astitv main vishwaas tha or yah vahaan "mjujic ov di sfirs' kehalaata tha
 The word or sound that is heard by meditating with the two hands closed with both ears closed
 anhad shabd vaa sabad
 Which has occurred without any shock
 naad ke liye kaha gaya he ki vah avyakt paramtatv ke vyaktikaran kaa suchak aadi shabd he jo pehle "puraa' shabd ke sookshm rup main rahaa karata he or phir kramash: "aparaa' shabd banakar anubhavgamya ho jaataa he
 The same element of the universe or the universe is the Pranav or form, which represents the word located in the human body or in the body and which, due to the outward orientation of the mind, we can never hear
 iskaa anubhav keval vahiin kar paata he jisaki kundalini shakti jaagrath ho jaati he or pranavayu sushumna naadon main pravesh kar jaati he
 The six chakras along the path of the sushumna are designated from below to the names of Muladhara, Swadhisthan, Manipur, Anahata, Pure and Commandment respectively and their places are also near the anus, near Meru, Nabhidesh, Hridayesh, Kantesh and Are considered corrupt
 ye kramash: chaar, chah, das, baarah, solah evam do dalonvale kamalpushpon ke rup main dikhalaai padate hai or inhen main se anahath main "brahmagranthi', vishuddh main "vishnugranthi' tathaa ajna main "rudragranthi' ke avasthaan bhi sthir kiye gaye hai
 When Pranayama penetrates these chakras, the sound of the sound is still there, but the yogi's heart becomes full from it and in the seeker, the form, lavana and light rise comes and he hears the "nanavidhi Bhushan Sound"
 phir jab aage pranavayu ke saath apan vaayu evam naadabindu ke abhimilan kii dasha aa jaati he tab vishnugranthi main brahmanand kii bheri sunai padate lagati he or naad kii vah sthiti ho jaati he jise "ghatavastha' kehete hai
 Similarly, until the third order goes into the Rudra Ganthi of the command cycle, the sound of Murdal starts to be experienced, the Ashtasiddhis achieve and the condition of "familiarity" is attained
 ant main brahmardhraan tathaa pranavayu ke pahunchne par chaturth avasthaa "nishpatti' aati he or vanshi yaa veen kii madhur dhwani kaa anubhav hota he
 This is the "age" of nad in which all the circles become void and the soul's location becomes personal

 prashn or uttar ke madhyam se samasya par vichaar karte hue samanvay kii ore uttarottar badhate janaa is paddati kii mul visheshta he
 Aflatoon gave Socrates an important place in his dialogues, suggesting that he was the best representative of this method
 aflatoon ne dwandvatmak tark ko paramgyan kaa siddhant mana he
 His theory of suffixes is based on this method
 dwandvatmak tark kii vishaywastu gyaan mimasaa evam vaastaviktaa kaa swabhaav he
 According to Aflatun, this scientific method is superior to all other methods, because through it clear knowledge is obtained
 isliye dwandvatmak tarkgyan paramgyan he
 Aristotle tried to give it a more logical form

 Thus dialectical reasoning has been used to solve problems from the beginning
 kintu dhire-dhire isaki prakruti jatiltar evam adhik vaigyanik hoti gai
 Dialectical reasoning has specific significance in modern philosophical systems
 kyonki pehle iskaa upyog aadhyatmik jagat kaa udghaatan karne ke liye kiya gaya, tatpashchaat iskaa upyog bhautik jagat kaa udghaatan karan ke liye kiya gaya, tatpashchaat ise bhautik jagat par lagu kiya gaya
 Kant gives a new meaning to this method in the context of creation, God and immortality
 kaant ne sapratipakshi tark, tarkabhas evam pratyayon kii vyakhya karte samay is paddati kaa upyog kiya he
 The rules of wisdom can only be applied to the world at the time of the nation, but when we apply it to transcendental truths, then we face the problem of counterintuitive logic, logic and experiential confusion
 kaant kii is antardrushti kaa laabh hegel ne uthaaya
 In fact, Hegel is the modern lecturer of dialectical logic
 unke anusaar dwandvatmak tark mulat: mananaatmak vichaaron kii vishisht prakruti he
 These thoughts express the nature of the system or general
 isaki gati main teen kshan aate hai, kram se jinhen vaad, pratwaad or samvaad kaha gaya he
 Thus the tendency of dialectical reasoning is oriented towards coordination
 samanvay yaa samvaad, vaad evam pratwaad kii ucchtar ekta he, yadhyapi yah donon se bhinn hota he, phir bhi donon usamen unnat rup main prastut rahete hai
 Thus it becomes clear here that dialectical reasoning is related to the speed of thought
 hegel ke anusaar param satya yaa nirpeksh satya swayan ko isi rup main vyakt karata he
 This method is of most importance in Hegel's logic
 ve kisi bhi tarah kii samasya ko pahchaanane ke liye dwandvatmak tark kaa upyog karte hai
 According to him dialectical reasoning is the basic element of his method
 unki pranali main yah paddati prayek sthaan par maujuud he
 Originally it moves with the rule of prohibition
 kintu is nishedhaatmakataa ke madhyam se vah samanyav kii ore hi pragati karti he
 Hegel presents the ultimate suffix by dialectical reasoning
 param pratyay vastusatya ke rup main kalpit kiya gaya he, kintu apane mul rup main vah amoort, deshkal se pare evam sarvabhakshi he
 Hence Hegel's suffixism argument
 ise aatma, chetana yaa nirgun satta par lagu karne ke bajaae, yadi use prakruti evam itihaas par lagu kiya jaae to use adhik arthvan rup diya ja saktaa he
 Karl Marx had said that Hegel had put dialectical logic headlong
 use pair ke bal khadaa karne kaa shrey marks evam angels ko he
 a completely new meaning is given to dialectical reasoning here
 is sthal par ise bhautikwaadi dwandvatmak tark kahana adhik upyukt hoga
 It is believed that nature, material world and history are the real niches of dialectical logic
 prakruti kii gati swayan dwandvatmak maani gai he
 According to dialectical materialism, change is the ultimate truth
 uske liye desh kaal se par kisi bhi amar satta kaa mahatv nahin he
 Origin, development and destruction are the characteristics of the world
 dwandvatmak darshan swayan man kii chintan prakriya kaa pratifalan he
 According to Marx, dialectical reasoning is the science of general rules of motion
 chaahe yah gati bahya jagat kii ho, chaahe aantarik man kii gati ho, in donon gatiyon kaa usamen adhyayan hota he
 According to Marx, the content of dialectical reasoning should be studied in the historical perspective
 itihaas kaa vikaas vargsangharsh ke madhyam se hua he
 As a result of which accidents and rebellions have taken place
 nirantarata main is prakaar avrodh utpann hota he
 Past stages in development have a different type of repetition, which is called "prohibition of negation"
 isi prishthbhumi main marks, angels evam lenin ne prakruti, itihaas, vargsangharsh, gyanamimasaa ityadi kii vyakhya kii he jise vyapak arthon main dwandvatmak bhautikwaad yaa aitihaasik bhautikwaad kaha gaya he

 ganit main, kaushi-islar sameekaran char gunank sahit raikhik samghaat saadhaaran avakal sameekaran he
 Sometimes it is also referred to as isosceles equation
 isaki saadhaaran saranchana ke kaaran is sameekaran ko niyat gunankon ke saath tulya sameekaran se pratisthapit kiya ja saktaa he jise spashtatya hal kiya ja saktaa he
 Let y be the n -th derivative of the unknown function y
 tab n koti kii kaushi-islar sameekaran nimna rup main praapt hoti he Putting x = eu { \ displaystyle x = e ^ {u}} gives the above equation as a linear differential equation with fixed coefficients
 vaikalpik rup se aadhaar hal ke rup main pariksharth hal y = x m { \ displaystyle y=x^{m}} le sakate hai
 The common cauchy-euler equation is a second-order equation, used in various applications of physics and engineering, such as when solving the Laplace equation in polar coordinates
 yah nimna sameekaran dwaara diya jaataa he : Taking the following solution as a solution to the above equation avkalan karne par: And vaastavik sameekaran main ye maan rakhane par : On reconfiguring: uparokt sameekaran ko m kaa maan praapt karne ke liye hal karne par
 There are three special conditions here: sthiti # 1 main, kaushi-islar sameekaran kaa vyapak hal nimna hoga : In case # 2, the comprehensive solution would be as follows yah hal praapt karne ke liye, ek hal y = xm praapt karne ke baad koti newnikaran vidhi kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 In case # 3, the comprehensive solution is given as follows: yahaan c 1 { \ displaystyle c_{1} \ ,} or c 2 { \ displaystyle c_{2} \ ,} vaastavik samakalan niyatank hai
 Such a solution is obtained by keeping x = et with the help of the oil formula
 nimna char pratisthaapan kaa upyog karne par On calculating: ye maan pratham sameekaran main rakhane par : φ { \ displaystyle \ phi } Solving the above equation in φ { \ displaystyle \ phi} using its characteristic polynomial easily ab, yadi λ 1 { \ displaystyle \ lambda _{1}} or λ 2 { \ displaystyle \ lambda _{2}} bahupad ke mul hai, tab ham nimna do sthitiyon main hal karenge: bhinn mul or dwi-mul: If the roots are different from each other, then the broad solution is given by the following equation yadi mul samaan hai to vyapak hal nimna prakaar diya jaat he In both these cases, the solution y { \ displaystyle y}, can be obtained by keeping t = ln ⁡ { \ displaystyle t = \ ln}, so φ) = y { \ displaystyle \ phi) = y}
 isliye pratham avasthaa main, agreed saadhaaran hal xα rakhane par: For xα to be a solution, it is necessary that either x = 0, which gives the simple solution, or that the coefficient of xα is zero
 dwighat sameekaran ko hal karne par hamen α = 1, 3 praapt hota he
 Hence the broad solution will be yahaan kaushi-islar sameekaran ke sadrishy antar sameekaran he
 For a constant m> 0, a sequence ƒm is defined as f m { \ displaystyle f_{m}} par antar sankaarak lagu karne par Repeating it k jahaan superscript antar sankaarak ke k baar doharaav ko pradarshit karata he
 Comparing this to the k th derivative of xm suggests that we can solve the N-th order difference equation in a similar manner to the differential equation case
 Indeed, substituting the trial solution brings us to the same situation as the differential equation case, One may now proceed as in the differential equation case, since the general solution of an N-th order linear difference equation is also the linear combination of n linearly independent solutions
 Applying reduction of order in case of a multiple root m1 will yield expressions involving a discrete version of ln, = ∫ 1 + m 1 x 1 t − m 1 d t 
 { \ displaystyle \ ln= \ int _{1+m_{1}}^{x}{ \ frac {1}{t-m_{1}}} \ ,dt
} ) In cases where fractions become involved, one may use instead, which coincides with the definition before for integer m

 As a result of this plan, a divine light appeared from inside the three trinity Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, which appeared as a woman upon seeing her
 is devi ko sabhi devi-devataaon ne kuch na kuch bhet swaroop pradaan kiya
 Lord Shankar provided the lion, Lord Vishnu the lotus, Indra the bell and the sea provided the never-ending garland

 And the same thing happened

 shiv ke sasur raja daksh ne yajna kaa aayojan kiya jisame unhone shiv or sati ko aamantrit nahin kiya kyonki vah shiv ko apane baraabar kaa nahin samajhate the
 Sati felt very bad about this and reached the yagna without calling
 yajna sthal par shiv kaa kaaphi apmaan kiya gaya jise sati sahan na kar saki or vah havan kund main kud gayin
 When Lord Shankar came to know about this, he came and removed Sati's body from Havan Kund and started doing Tandava
 jis kaaran saare brahmand main haahaakaar much gaya
 To save the entire universe from this crisis, Lord Vishnu divided the body of Sati from his Sudarshan Chakra into 51 parts which became the Shakti Peetha where he fell

 Thousands of years ago, there was the rule of two demons named Shumbha and Nishumbha on the earth

 As a result, the gods and humans worshiped Goddess Durga and Goddess Durga gave them a boon that she would definitely protect them from these two demons

 Indra's Eiravat elephant is also with you
 is kaaran aapke paas aisi divya or aakarshak nari bhi honi chahie jo ki teenon lokon main sarvasundar he

 yah sun doot mata koshiki ke paas gaya or dono daityo dwaara kahe gayi vachan mata ko suna diye
 Mother said that i believe that both Shumbha and Nishumbha are great forces

 All these things the angel told Shumbha and Nishumbh
 to vah dono koshiki ke vachan sun kar us par krodhit ho gayi or kaha us nari kaa yah dussaahas ki vah hamen yuddh ke liye lalakaare
 Then he sent two asuras named Chand and Mund and said that take his hair and bring it to us
 chand or mund devi koshiki ke paas gayi or use apane saath chalane ke liye kaha
 When the goddess refused, he attacked the goddess
 tab devi ne apana kaali rup dhaaran kar liya or asuro ko yamalok pahunchaa diya
