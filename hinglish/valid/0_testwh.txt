 This theory evolved from the concept of continental displacement, envisaged in the first decade of the twentieth century, when new evidence was discovered in the 1960s that strengthened the concept of continents being dynamic rather than static
 in saakshyon main sabase mahatvapurn hai purachumbakatv se sambandhit sakshya jinase sagar nital prasaran kii pushti hui
 The discovery of Sagar Nittal Varshan by Harry Hayes is believed to be the beginning of the rendering of this theory and scholars like Wilson, Morgan, mckenzie, Oliver, Parker etc
 contributed to its promotion by providing evidence in its favor

 These plates are floating on the semicircular layer of the asthenosphere at the bottom and are generally moving at a speed of about 10–40 mm / yr, although some have a velocity of 160 mm / yr

 The concept was first propagated in Europe by Austrian Edward Swoos
 iske vipareet kuch kaa maananaa tha ki mahadwipon kaa kshaitij sthantharan hua he or inke takaraane se upree sataha main bal pad jane se parvaton kaa nirmaan hua he
 The first challenge to contractionists was when the concept of horizontal transfer of continents emerged

 The English philosopher Francis Bacon first marked this resemblance with the study of exact maps, with the cartographer Abraham Ortelius saying in 1596 that the Americas broke apart from Europe and Africa, and the German theologian Theodor Lilienthal's statement of Ortelius in 1756 Attempted to confirm on the basis of a biblical statement

 Wagner was the first to use the term "continental displacement", following the same principle of Wagner that the development of plate tectonics was possible, although his ideas were also rejected by scholars for nearly half a century until evidence was available in the 1960s
 
 or mahadwipiya visthaapan Due to the mobility of the plates, there are three types of edges or borders: is prakaar ke kinaaron ke sahare do platen ek duusare kii ore gati karti hai or takaraakar unamem se baari plate halaki plate ke neeche kshepit hoti he
 This part, which is twisted downward, goes deep and melts and converts into magma due to the excess of heat and pressure
 jis gaharaai par yah ghatana hoti he use kshepan mandal yaa beniof zone kehete hai
 With the help of such edges, due to pressure of the landowners, they turn and form mountains
 neeche jaakar pighla padaarth megma plum ke rup main upar uth kar jwalamukhiyata bhi utpann karata he
 Where two plates move opposite to each other, that is, they move away from each other, magma rises up from the bottom to form a new plate

 Rift valleys are formed when this shore lies on a continent
 nayi plate ke nirmaan ke kaaran ise rachanaatmak kinaaraa bhi kehete hai
 The protective edge is the one with which the two platens are moving, rubbing each other, that is, neither descending nor converging
 saamanytah is kinare ke sahare ek duusare ko ragadate huye vipareet dishaao main gatisheel hoti hai kintu yah anivaary nahin he, yadi do platen ek hi disha main gatisheel hon or unki gati alag-alag ho tab bhi unke kinare ragadate huye sangrakshi kinaaraa bana sakate hai
 Transform faults are found on their support

 Plate tectonics theory offers the newest explanation of the construction of fine mountains
 udhaaharan ke liye alpine parvat tantra ke parvaton kii utpatti kii vyakhya ko prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 According to this theory it is believed that the series of mountains on the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean Sea are the result of tectonic events in the Tertiary era in which they were formed by compression between the African and European plates of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea

 a Zener diode is a type of diode that not only causes the current to flow in the same way as a normal diode, but if the voltage is higher than the breakdown voltage, also known as the "zener Ni voltage" or "zener voltage"
 Allows to flow in the opposite direction

 ek jiner diod main baari maatra main doped p-n jankshan sammilit hai jo electran ko p-varg padaarth ke sangyojan band se n-varg padaarth ke chaalan band tak tunnel banane kii anumati dete hai
 In the atomic scale, this tunneling corresponds to the transfer of the conjunctive band electron to the empty conduction band state; This is due to the decreased barrier between these bands and the high electric field induced by the relatively high degree of doping on both sides
 ek reverse-biked jiner diod ek niyantrit bhang kaa pradarshan karata he or bijli ko anumati detaa he ki vah jiner diod main voltage ko jiner voltage par rakhe

 In a 5

 jab bajirao abhiyaan par pune se baahar the, tab mastaani ko ghar main najarband kiya gaya
 Seeing Bajirao's deteriorating health on the expedition, Chimaji ordered Nanasaheb to leave Mastani and send him to meet Bajirao
 par nanasaheb ne iske bajaay apni maa kashibai ko bheja
 Kashibai is said to have served Bajirao as a loyal and dutiful wife on his deathbed and her description is said to be highly dedicated to her husband
 unhone or unke bete janardan ne bajirao kaa antim sanskaar kiya
 Mastani also died in 1740 after Bajirao's death and Kashibai took care of his son Shamsher Bahadur i and facilitated training him in weapons

 sigmund frid austria ke tantrikavigyaani tathaa manovishleshan ke sansthaapak the
 Sigmund Freud was born in the city of Freiburg in the austrian-hungarian Empire
 unke mata-pita yahudee the
 Freud's father was a wool merchant and his mother's third wife
 frid apane saat bhai-bahanon main sabase bade the
 At the age of 3, Freud's father moved to Leipzig and a year later moved to Vienna, where he lived for about 80 years
 frid ne vienna vishvavidhyalay se 1881 main doctor of medicine kiya
 Freud fled to London in 1938 due to Hitler's Nazi uprising
 landan main hi san 1939 ke sitambar maheene main unki mrityu ho gai
 Shortly before the beginning of the nineteenth century, psychology developed as an independent science
 isse pehle manovigyaan ko darshan ke antargat padhaa jaataa tha
 The aim of psychology at that time was to analyze and study the consciousness of adult human beings
 frid ne is paramparaagat "chetana ke manovigyaan " kaa virodh kiya or manovishleshan sambandhi kai nai sankalpanaaon kaa pratipaadan kiya jisapar hamaara aadhunik manovigyaan tikaa hua he
 Looking at Freud's early life, we find that from the beginning his inclination was towards neuroscience
 san 1873 se 1881 ke bich unka sampark us samay ke mashhoor tantrika vigyaani ernest bruki se hua
 Freud was influenced by Ernst Brookey and began work in his laboratory
 sharir vigyaan or tantrika vigyaan main kai shodh patr prakashit karne ke baad frid ernest bruki se alag hue or unhone apana nijee vyavsaay chikitsak ke rup main prarambh kiya
 In 1881, Freud received his M

 from the University of Vienna
 isse thik thode se vakt pehle frid kaa sampark joseph briuvar se hua
 Freud wrote the paper "studies in Hysteria" with Joseph Briuver
 "studies in histyria" ek rogi ke vishleshan par aadhaarit tha, jiskaa kaalpanik naam "anna o" tha
 It is believed that the seeds of psychoanalyticism were hidden in this paper
 yah shodh bahut mashhoor hua
 In 1896, there was a professional disagreement between Brewer and Freud and they separated
 san 1900 frid ke jivan kaa sabase mahatvapurn varsh tha
 In the same year his famous book "interpretation of Dream" was published, based on his and his patients' dream analyzes
 isamen unhone bataaya ki sapane hamaari atrupt ichchhaaon kaa pratibimb hote hai
 This book made him famous
 kai samakaleen buddhijivi or manovigyaani unki ore aakarshith hue
 Prominent among them are Carl Jung, Alfred Adler, Otto Rank, and Sanador Française
 in sabhi vyaktiyon se frid kaa acha sampark tha, par baad main matbhinnata hui or log unase alag hote gayi
 In 1909, the famous psychologist at Clark University, GS
 Recently Freud received an invitation to lecture on psychoanalysis, which proved to be a milestone in his fame
 In addition to Freud, Yung, Vryl, Jones, Ferencji and many other famous psychologists were present

 Jung and Adler agreed with several points of Freud's psychoanalyticism
 parantu frid dwaara sex par atyadhik bal die jane ko unhone asweekrut kar diya
 This separated them both at different times
 jung ne manovishleshan main saanskrithik viraasat ke dakhal par or edler ne saamaajikta par bal diya
 Although it is true that professional colleagues were getting separated from him one by one, yet his fame did not matter
 san 1923 main frid ke muh main cancer kaa pataa chalaa jiskaa kaaran unka zarurat se zyada cigar pinaa bataaya gaya
 In 1933, Hitler took over Germany's power
 usne saaf kaha ki frid vaad ke liye uski satta main koi jagah nahi he
 Hitler burned all of Freud's books and manuscripts
 vah shaayad isse bhi adhik bura vyavhaar karata lekin raajnneetik dabaav or tatkaaleen american rajdoot ke hastkshep ke baad hitler ne frid se jabardasti ek kaagaj par hastakshar karavaaya ki sainikon ne unke saath koi bura vyavhaar nahi kiya he
 After this he was ordered to leave Vienna and go to London
 landan main unka bhavy swaagat hua
 He was immediately made a member of the Royal Society
 yahan unhone apni antim pustak "mozej and monethism" kaa prakaashan karavaaya
 Freud considered the form of mind or personality to be dynamic
 unke anusaar vyaktitv hamaare mastishk evam sharir kii kriyaaon kaa naam he
 Freud has mental elements that do not come into consciousness or come into consciousness in the state of hypnosis or consciousness
 isamen balykaal kii icchhaaen, langik icchhaaen or maansik sangharsh aadi se sambandhit ve icchhaaen hoti hai, jinka gyaan swayan vyakti ko bhi nahin hota
 These are usually not able to be fulfilled in a person's daily life and they appear in a distorted form, either in the form of dreams or in the form of hysterical seizures
 frid ke anusaar vyaktitv kaa gatyaatmak paksh teen avasthaaon dwaara nirmit hota he - Idi originates with the birth of a human being
 frid ise vyaktitv kaa sabase mahatvapurn hissaa maanata tha
 Its contents are desires that are related to libido and seek immediate satisfaction
 urja kii vruddhi idan nahin sahan kar paata or agar ise sahi dhang se abhivyakti nahi milti tab yah vikrut swarup dhaaran karke vyakti ko prabhavit karata he
 For Freud, self-consciousness was like what he called a secondary regulator of human behavior
 yah idan kaa sangathit bhaag he, iskaa uddeshy idan ke lakshyon ko aage badhanaa he
 Para ego is a type of behavior model from which ethical behaviors are employed
 iskaa vikaas apekshaakrit der se hota he
 Freud's personality ideas are also called the theory of psychological development
 ise frid ne 5 avasthaaon main baanta he - Based on these, he conceptualized the controversial Electra and Oedipus Complex, according to which the sexual power of the infant is initially effective for itself, gradually being oriented towards other people
 isi kaaran putr mata kii ore tathaa putree pita kii ore adhik aakarshith hote hai
 This leads to a love for the mother and rivalry for the father in boys, which Freud named Oedipus Complex
 yah bahut vivaadaaspad or charchit avadharana rahi he
 Freud could not provide figures to prove the truth of these concepts
 He was criticized by critics for mixing his experiences with these observations and blindly believing what his patients said
 frid par yah bhi aarope lage ki vah manovigyaan main zarurat se adhik kalpanashiltaa or mithkeey granthon kaa ghalmail kar rahe hai, yon aavashyaktaaon ko zarurat se adhik sthaan de rahe hai
 Looking at Freud's work and his beliefs based on them, we find that Freud exerted more on human bestial tendencies
 unhone yah spasht kiya ki nimnatar pashuon ke bahut saare gun or visheshtaayen manushyon main bhi dikhaai detii hai
 The concept of basic tendency as defined by him also comes under this
 frid kaa yah mat tha ki vayask vyakti ke swabhaav main kisi prakaar kaa parivartan nahin laayaa ja saktaa kyonki uske vyaktitv kii neenv bachapan main hi pad jaati he, jise kisi bhi tareeke se badla nahi ja saktaa
 haalaanki baad ke shodhon se yah sabit ho chukaa he ki manushya multah bhavishya unmukh hota he
 Like an academic psychologist, Freud's psychology does not see serialization, but he gave psychology a new definition, on the basis of which we find modern psychoanalytic psychology to stand and, despite all the criticisms, Freud's contribution to abnormal psychology and clinical psychology is not ignored
 Can be done
 frid dwaara pratipaadit manovishleshan kaa sampradaay apni lokapriyata ke karan bahut charchit rahaa
 frid ne kai pustake likhin jinamein se "inter pratesan of drims", "group psychology and da enelysis of di igo ", "totem and tabu " or "civilaijesan and its diskaantents " pramukh hai
 He died on 23 September 1939 in London

 govind tritiy dhruv dharvarsh kaa putr tha
 Dhruva, after ruling successfully for 13 years, probably crowned his third and best son Govind around 793 AD during his lifetime
 uske purv govind kaa yuvarajpad par vidhiwat abhishek ho chukaa tha
 The reason for this was on one hand Dhruva's desire to make his Govind the official and on the other hand his fear that his elder boys should not start a war of succession after his death to get their rights
 saath hi dhruv ne apane anya putron ko apane samrajya ke vibhinn kshetron kaa prantiy shaasha niyukt kar diya
 But he was also not going to sit silently impressed by Govind iii's military ability and political acumen or satisfied by his father's succession to his throne
 govind tritiy ke sabase bade bhai stambh ne apane pita dhruv ke marane ke baad uttaradhikaar ke liye apni shakti aajamaane kii thaanee
 He was also fueled by some feudal kings, whose number is mentioned 12 in some Rashtrakuta records
 pehle to govind tritiy ne apane anya bhaaiyon ke tarah stambh ko bhi prasann karnaa chaha, par use koi safalataa na mili or donon main yuddh hokar hi rahaa
 Govind's younger brother Indra helped him
 yuddh main stambh kii haar hui parantu govind ne uske prati narmi kii hi niti apanaai or use apni ore se gang pradesh kaa prashaasak niyukt kar diya
 Settled on the throne, Govind paid attention to suppressing the rebellious feudals and expanding his dominion power
 gang shaasha shivabhaar rashtrakooton ke dwaara kaid kiya ja chukaa tha par kaid se mukti paakar usne swatantraaa kii pravriti dikhaai or rashtrakut adhisatta ko uthaa phenkane kii koshish kii
 Govind defeated him immediately, he was captured again and Gangwadi was merged within the Rashtrakuta Empire
 stambh pun: vahaan kaa governor niyukt kiya gaya
 Govind then defeated the ruler of Kanchi but his victory was not permanent and he had to undertake another expedition on Kanchi within a few days
 pun: usne vengi ke purvi chalukya shaasha vijayaditya par akraman kar usko apni bhrityopyukt seva ke liye vivash kiya
 After consolidating his dominion over almost all the states of the South, Govind started influencing the politics of the North
 uske pita dhruv ne gurjar pratihaar shaasha vatsaraj or palraj dharmpal donon hi ko parrast kar uttar bharat kii digvijay kii thi
 But after that there were many new scenes at the North Indian theater
 dharmpal ne chakrayudh ko apane namankit or karad ke rup main kanyakubj kii gaddi par bithaane main safalataa paa lee thi, parantu vatsaraj ke uttaradhikari nagabhatta dwitiya ne tunrat pasa palat diya or kannauj kaa swami ban gaya
 In such circumstances Govind III intervened in North Indian politics and started his victorious campaign
 kushal raajnneetijna or daksh senapati ke anuroop un abhiyaanon ke purv apane parshvon kii suraksha kaa purna prabandh kar liya tha
 In the same policy, he left Indra to prevent any accidental escalation of the Gurjara Pratiharas in Malwa and Gujarat
 After this, there was a war between Nagabhatta and Govind somewhere in Bundelkhand where the Gurjara Pratihara armies had to be defeated and Nagabhatta was given a chance to protect himself
 Had to take refuge in an unknown place
 tatpashchaat govind kii senaayen himalay kii ore badhin or kahin raste main dharmpal or chakrayudh ne bhi uski adheenta maan lee
 Even on his return, Govind's forces conquered south-eastern Madhya Bharat and many areas of Bengal and Orissa
 parantu govind kaa sara uttar bhartiya abhiyaan digvijay maatr tha or uskaa rashtrakooton kii sainik pratishtha kii vruddhi ke atirikt koi vishesh prabhaav na hua
 There was no increase in the north of the Rashtrakuta empire army
 iskaa mukhya karan duuri thi
 The time of his campaigns is now generally considered to be between 800-802 AD
 uttar bhartiya abhiyaanon se nivrutt hokar govind ne pun: ek baar dakshin main apni sainik shaktiyon kaa pradarshan kiya
 The reason was the rise of the spirit of independence in some of the rulers there
 parantu unhen dabaane ke purv usne pashchimi bharat main bhadauch kii ore prayaag kiya tha, jahaan shribhavan ke raja ne uskaa swaagat kiya
 From Sri Bhavan, he moved towards the south
 gangawadi, kerala, pandya, chol or kanchi ke raajaaon na uske viruddh ek sainik sangh kii sthapana kar lee thi parantu yuddh main ve sabhi haar gaye or unke asankhya sainik khet rahe
 Govind's forces captured Kanchi and routed the Pandya and Chola regions
 govind kii sainik safalt xxrep 4 a n se sinhal kaa raja bhaybheet ho uthaa or usne bhi uski adheenta sweekaar kar lee
 It is clear that Govind became a highly qualified and successful ruler in the Third Rashtrakutas and continued to influence the South and North Indian politics of his time equally
 sainik or raajnneetik pratishtha kii drushti se use samasamyik bharat kaa sarvapramukh shaasha kaha ja saktaa he
 He grew the most of the Rashtrakuta dynasty in his time and behind his successes his personal valor, diplomacy and mobilization power was abundant

 Fluorostatics, fluid statics or hydrostatics is the science of the steady state of liquids and a subdivision of fluid mechanics
 is vigyaan main yah adhyayan kiya jaataa he ke kin halaat main koi taral padaarth yantric santulan main hone kii vajah se shant hota he
 Conversely, fluid dynamics is the branch of science in which moving, turbulent or discontinuous fluids are studied
 jab dore se bandhe batkhare aadi kisi baari pind ko pani main dubokar dore ko pakade rahete hai, tab dekha jaataa he ki itnaa bal nahin lagaana padataa, jitna bal us pind ko pani se baahar khinch lene par lagata he
 The reason why this happens is first discovered by the mathematician Archimedes and theorized that the fluid exerts a vertical exerting force on a body immersed in a fluid, which is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body
 utkshep kaa nidaan karte samay taral daab kii sankalpana saamne aati he, arthath ek aise bal kii jo taral apane se sampark main aae hue pind ke prayek prishth alpaansh par lagaataa he
 The existence of such pressure gives us the impression that force is required to stop the water coming out of the hole
 archimedies ke niyam kii vyakhya is pariklpana ke aadhaar par di ja sakati he ki taral daab taral ke samparkwaale pind ke prishth-alpaansh par lambat: kriya karata he
 To bring clarity to the concept of pressure, the pressure intensity is defined by saying that it is the limit of the ratio of the force exerted by the liquid to the area of the surface, when the area moves towards zero
 prachandta kii sakanlpana kaa ek mahatvapurn laabh yah he ki taral ke prayek bindu par iskaa maan gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 It can be proved that at a point of liquid the pressure of pressure in all directions is equal and it is called the hydrostatic daw at that point
 sanketakshar p dwaara ise prakat karte hai
 The amplitude of this pressure is the force per unit area
 yah bhi siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki yadi drav kaa ghanatv achar he, to daab gaharaai kaa samaanupati he or kshaitij tal main samaan rahata he
 According to this principle only - 'khojahi Dadak Sada Nija Level'
 jalprabandh main is gun kaa upyog kiya jaataa he or utsrut coop bhi isi kaaran chal pate hai
 Based on this, Leonardo de Vinci posited a law of transmittance of fluid pressure that if at any point in the fluid without increasing the geometric limits, the pressure is automatically increased at each point of the fluid
 bal kaa pariman daab or kshetrafal ke gunanfal ke baraabar hone ke kaaran chote kshetrafal par thodaa bal lagane kaa parinaam vahi hota he, jo bade kshetrafalke piston par bade bal ke lagane kaa

 The free surface of the fluid and the floor between the immiscible liquids are both horizontal
 anya shabdon main---taral dwaara kisi tal ke pruti ekank chhetrafal par aropit lambbat bal ko taral daab kehete he!arthath Here p = Pressure means fluid pressure, f = Force means force, and a = Area means area
 In SI method of liquid pressure, the unit is new / m / which is also called Pascal! And it is shown by PA! Its dimensional formula is ML-1T-2

 If a flushed body is given different positions in which the fluid displaced by it is equal to the weight, then the point of the buoyancy center is called the buoyant plane and the position of the body in equilibrium is the position in which between the buoyancy center and the center of gravity of the body
 The distance is maximum or minimum
