711482 firoz shah tululaq dilli sultanate main tululaq vansh kaa shaasha tha
 Ferozeshah Tughlaq was born on 1309
 wo bharat par antim muslim shaasha tha
 He ruled from 1351 to 1388
 wo, dipalpur kii hidun rajkumaari kaa putr tha
 He forced many Hindus to adopt Muslim religion during his rule
 usne apane shasankaal main hi chaandi ke sikke chalaaye| firozshah tululaq, mohammad tululaq kaa chachera bhai evam sipahsalaar 'rajab' kaa putr tha
 His mother 'bibi Jaizella' was the daughter of Rajput chieftain Rajamal
 mohammad tululaq kii mutyu ke baad 20 march 1351 ko firoz tululaq kaa rajbhishak thatta ke nikat hua
 Feroze was crowned again in Delhi in August, 1351
 sultan banane ke baad firozshah tululaq ne sabhi qarze maaf kar die, jisamen 'sondhar rin' bhi shaamil tha, jo mohammad tululaq ke samay kisaanon ko diya gaya tha
 After becoming Sultan, Feroze Tughlaq invaded Bengal and Sindh as part of his campaign to conquer his territories separated from the Delhi Sultanate
 bengal ko jeetne ke liye sultan ne 1353 i
 main akraman kiya
 At that time, Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah was the ruler of that place
 usne ikdala ke qile main sharan le rakhi thi, sultan firoz antatah qile par adhikaar karne main asafal hokar 1355 i
 main waapas dilli aa gaya
 Again in 1359 AD, Firuz Tughlaq attacked Sikandar Shah, the son of the then ruler Shamsuddin, in an attempt to take control of Bengal, but failed once again
 1360 i main sultan firoz ne ‘jajanagar’ par akraman karke vahaan ke shaasha bhanudev tritiy ko parrast kar puri ke jagannatha mandir puri ko dhwast kiya
 In 1361 AD, Feroze attacked Nagarkot
 yahan ke jambabaniyon se ladati hui sultan kii sena lagbhag 6 maheene tak ran ke registan main fasi rahi, kaalaantar main jambabaniyon ne sultan kii adheenta ko sweekaar kar liya or vaarshik kar dene ke liye sahamat ho gayi
 Apart from these simple victories, there has been no major success in the name of Feroze
 usne dakshin main swatantra hue rajya vijaynagar, bahamani evam madura ko punah jeetne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 Thus it can be said that Sultan Firuz Tughlaq did not undertake any military campaign during his reign for the expansion of the empire and whatever campaign he did, only to save the empire
 rajasav vyavastha ke antargat firoz ne apane shashan kaal main 24 kshtdaayak karon ko samaapt kar diya or keval 4 kar ‘karaaj’, ‘khums’, ‘jazia’, evam 'zakaat' ko vasuul karne kaa aadesh diya
 On the orders of the Ulama, the Sultan also imposed a new irrigation tax, which charged 1 / 10 of the produce
 sambhavtah firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal main lagaan upaj kaa 1 / 5 se 1 / 3 bhaag hota tha
 To facilitate irrigation, the Sultan built 5 big canals from the Yamuna River to Hisar, 150 miles long from the Sutlej River to the Ghaggar River, from the hill of Sirmour to the Hansi, from Ghaggar to Firozabad and from Yamuna to Firozabad
 usne falo ke lagbhag 1200 baag lagavaaye

 The foundation of Jaunpur city was laid by Firoz in memory of his cousin 'fakhruddin Jauna'
 uske shashan kaal main khijrabad evam meerut se ashok ke do stambhalekhon ko laakar dilli main sthapit kiya gaya
 Under his welfare works, Firoz set up an employment office and a new department called diwan-e-khairat to help Muslim orphans, widows and girls
 'daarul-shafa' naamak ek rajkeey aspataal kaa nirmaan karavaaya, jisamen garibon kaa muft ilaaj hota tha
 During the reign of Firoz, the number of slaves reached about 1,80,000
 inaki dekhbhaal hetu sultan de 'dewan-e-bandaraan' kii sthapana kii
 Some slaves were sent to the provinces and the rest were kept in the center

 Slaves were also given handcraft training

 He made military posts hereditary, affecting the ability of soldiers to check

 After some time his terrible result came to light
 firoz tululaq ko kuch itihaaskaar dharmandh evam ashishnu shaasha maanate hai
 Probably he was the first Sultan of Delhi Sultanate, who followed strict Islamic rules and gave importance to the Ulema class in administrative work
 nyaay vyavastha par punah dharmaguruon kaa prabhaav sthapit ho gaya
 Mukti used to explain the laws
 musalmaan aparaadhiyon ko mrityu dand dena band kar diya gaya
 Feroze was a staunch Sunni Muslim
 usne hindu janata ko ‘jimmy’ kaha or hindu brahmanon par jazia kar lagaaya
 Dr

C
 Majumdar has stated that, "firuz was the most fanatical of this era and the Sinkadar Lodi and Aurangzeb in this region was outgoing
 ’ dilli sultanate main pratham baar firoz tululaq ne brahmanon se bhi jazia liya
 In the field of education, Sultan Firoz established many tombs and madrasas
 usne 'jiyauddin barani' evam 'shams-e-siraaj afif' ko apana sangrakshan pradaan kiya
 Barani composed 'fatwa-e-jahandari' and 'date-e-firozshahi'
 firoz ne apni aatmakatha ‘phutuhat-e-firozshahi’ kii rachana kii jabaki ‘sirat-e-firozshahi’ kii rachana kisi agyaat viddhan dwaara kii gai he
 Firoz translated some of the 1300 texts looted from the library of the Jwalamukhi temple under the name 'dalaiyte-firozshahi' by Eduddin
 'valaile-firozshahi' ayurveda se sambandhit granth tha
 He invented the water clock

 Sultan Firoz Tughlaq built Kotla Feroz Shah Durg in Delhi

 Sultan Ferozeshah Tughlaq himself encouraged bribery in the administration
 afif ke anusaar-sultan ne ek ghudsavaar ko apane khazaane se ek taka diya, taaki vah rishwat dekar arj main apane ghode ko paas karvaa saken
 Firoz Tuglaq was the first ruler of the Sultanate who got the details of the man of the state
 khwaja hisamuddin ke ek anumaan ke anusaar- firoz tululaq ke shashan kaal kii vaarshik aay 6 karod 75 lakh takaad Firoz Tughlaq issued a large number of coins made of a mixture of copper and silver under the currency system, which were probably called 'adha' and 'egypt'
 firoz tululaq ne ‘shanshgani’ kaa nayaa sikaa chalavaaya tha
 He inscribed the name of his son or successor 'fatah Khan' with his name on the coins
 firoz ne apane ko caliph kaa nib pukaara tathaa sikkon par caliph kaa naam ankit karavaaya
 The rule of Ferozeshah Tughlaq was based on welfare autocracy
 vah pratham sultan tha, jisne vijayon tathaa yudhon kii tulana main apni praja kii bhautik unnati ko shreshth sthaan diya, shaasha ke kartavyon kaa vistrut kiya tathaa islam dharm ko rajya shashan kaa aadhaar banaaya

 is granth main nagarjun kii saras kavypratibha kaa puraa parichay pathak ko mil jaataa he
 The pillar of Nagarjuna's Kirtimandir is the local important philosophical treatise, the Secondary Karika

 This book, divided into 27 cases, is set in the courts
 yah prasannapada ke saath mul anuwaad main leningrad se nagaraksharon main prakashit bhi hua he
 In Nagarjuna's view, the basic element is nothing other than zero
 dhyaan dene kii baat yah he ki yah shunya koi nishedhaatmak vastu nahin he jiskaa aplaap kiya ja sake
 It is possible to use only four categories in the design of any substance - asti, nasti, tadubhayam and nobhayam
 parmarth in chaaron kotiyon se mukt hota he or isiilie uske abhidhaan ke liye "shunya" shabd kaa prayog ham karte hai
 In the words of Nagarjuna- shoonyavad kii siddhi ke liye nagarjun ne vidhvansaatmak tark kaa upyog kiya he - vah tark, jiske sahare padaarth kaa vishleshan karte karte vah keval shunyarup main tik jaataa he
 On the strength of this argument, Nagarjuna has the credit for making a very serious, touching and original discussion of elements like matter, speed, caste, time, connection, soul, etc
 is mat main satya do prakaar kaa hota he - saanvruthik satya tathaa parmaarthik satya jinamein pratham avidya se utpann vyaavhaarik satta kaa sanket karata he; dwitiya pragna janit satya kaa pratipadak he
 The word "samvruti" means avidya
 avidyajanit hone se vyaavhaarik satya saanvruthik satya ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 In the view of Nagarjuna, this two-pronged interpretation of truth is not the new imagination evoked by nihilism, indicated by ancient Buddha itself
 buddha ke katipay upadesh vyaavhaarik satya ke aadhaar par die gaye hai; anya upadesh parmaarthik satya ke upar alambit hai
 Buddha is both desired - nagarjun darshanik hote hue bhi vyavhaar kii upeksha karanevaale acharya nahin the
 They know that without taking shelter of behavior, there can be no preaching of charitable and in the absence of attainment of charitableness, Nirvana cannot be attained
 saadhaaran maanvon kii buddhi vyavhaar main itani aasakt he ki use parmarthpath par laane ke liye vyavhaar kaa aplaap nahin kiya ja saktaa
 As a result, the untruth of behavior is not an object rendered by charitable words

 Brahma was so impressed by the persuasion of Indra and other gods of heaven that he used the four Vedas to create the dance Vedas
 natya veda athwa pancham veda, bharat va uske anuyaayiyon ko pradaan kiya gaya jinhone is vidya kaa parichay prithvi ke nashwar manushyon ko diya

 This is a very colorful dance
 iske nartak ubhare hue paridhaanon, phooldaar dupatton, aabhushanon or mukut se saje hote hai
 They take a form of symbolic characterization to portray various roles that are closer to the character than to the individual character
 vibhinn visheshtaayen, maanav, devtaa samaan, daitya aadi ko shandaar veshbhusha or paridhaanon ke madhyam se pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 The most impressive part of this dance is that its characters never speak, only the highly developed language of their hand gestures and the expression of the face that displays the text of this play to the audience
 unke chehre ke chote or bade haav bhav, bhanvon kii gati, netron kaa sanchalan, gaalon, naak or thodi kii abhivyakti par baariki se kaam kiya jaataa he tathaa ek kathakali abhinayta - nartak dwaara vibhinn bhaawanaaon ko prakat kiya jaataa he

 Now in this dance, more emphasis was placed on aesthetic sense than religion

 Seven lanurahs danced on this newly created hemisphere, pressing it tenderly with their feet to make it strong and smooth

 To this day, when the Manipuri people dance, they do not move fast, but place their feet on the ground with tenderness and softness
 mul bhranti or kahaniyaan abhi bhi metai ke pujaariyon yaa mibis dwaara mibi ke rup main sunai jaati hai jo manipuri kii jad hai

 In 1941, the foundation of the first five-year plan was laid in which emphasis was laid on the development of villages
 is samay tak imperial bank of india kaa kaarobaar sirf shaharon tak simit tha
 Therefore, in view of rural development, a bank which has access to the villages and which benefits the rural masses, was conceived

 Initially, the business of banks was to redeem exchange bills or other negotiable private securities, maintain cash accounts and deposit and issue and circulate cash notes

 Banks in Bengal and Bombay were engaged in financing large modern manufacturing industries, while Bank of Madras started financing small scale industries like nowhere else
 parantu in teenon bainkon ko videshi mudra se jude kisi bhi vyavsaay se alag rakhaa gaya
 Such a business was considered a business risk for these banks holding government deposits, as well as the fear that these banks under government protection would create an unfair competition for exchange banks in India at that time
 varsh 1935 main bhartiya reserve bank kaa gathan hone tak in bainkon ko is vyavsaay se alag rakhaa gaya
 The Imperial Bank of India was formed by merging the Presidency Banks of Bengal, Bombay and Madras in the year 1921 with their 70 branches

 In the end, a mixed organization emerged which carried out the functions of commercial banks and semi-central banks

 When the First five-year Plan started in the year 1951, the development of rural areas of the country was given the highest priority in it
 us samay tak imperial bank of india sahit desh ke vanijyik bainkon kaa kaary-kshetra shahari kshetra tak hi simit tha tathaa ve gramin kshetron ke aarthik punarnirmaan kii bhavi aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karne ke liye puri tarah taiyaar nahin the
 Therefore, to meet the overall economic situation of the country in general and the needs of the rural sector in particular, the All India Rural Credit Survey Committee acquired Imperial Bank of India and established a government-sponsored and government-sponsored bank in it
 Recommendations in which it was also proposed to integrate the erstwhile state-owned or state-owned banks tadnusaar may 1955 main sansad main ek adhinium paarit kiya gaya tathaa 1 july 1955 ko bhartiya state bank kaa gathan kiya gaya

 Naradji had asked Brahma, o father! i wish to hear the story of Ekadashi of Krishna Paksha of Shravan month, what is its name? What is the method and what is its significance, so please say
 naradji ke ye vachan sunakar brahmaji ne kaha- he naarad! lokon ke hit ke liye tumne bahut sundar prashn kiya he
 The name of Krishna Ekadashi of Shravan month is Kamika

 On this day, Shankha, Chakra, Gadadhari Vishnu is worshiped, whose names are Sridhar, Hari, Vishnu, Madhav, Madhusudan
 unki puja karne se jo fal miltaa he so suno
 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga jo fal ganga, kaashi, naimisharany or pushkar snaan se miltaa he, vah vishnu bhagwaan ke pujan se miltaa he
 The fruit which is not obtained by bathing in Kurukshetra and Kashi on sun and lunar eclipse, donating earth including sea, forest, Godavari in Jupiter of Leo zodiac and bathing in Gandaki river also gets worship from Lord Vishnu
 jo manushya shravan main bhagwaan kaa pujan karte hai, unase devtaa, gandharva or surya aadi sab poojit ho jate hai
 Therefore, humans who are afraid of sins, must observe Kamika Ekadashi fast and worship Lord Vishnu
 paparupi keechad main phase hue or sansarrupi samudr main duube manushyon ke liye is ekadshi kaa vrath or bhagwaan vishnu kaa pujan atyant aavashyak he
 Beyond this, there is no way to destroy sins
 he naarad! swayan bhagwaan ne yahi kaha he ki kamika vrath se jeev kuyoni ko praapt nahin hota
 People who devoutly offer Tulsi party to Lord Vishnu on this Ekadashi stay away from all sins of this world
 vishnu bhagwaan ratna, moti, mani tathaa aabhushan aadi se itane prasann nahin hote jitne tulsi dal se
 The fruit of Tulsi Dal Pujan is equal to the donation of four weights of silver and one weight of gold
 he naarad! main swayan bhagwaan kii atipriy tulsi ko sadaiv namaskara karata hoon
 All the tortures of humans are destroyed by watering the basil plant
 darshan maatr se sab paap nasht ho jate hai or sparsh se manushya pavitra ho jaataa he
 Even on the night of Kamika Ekadashi, Chitragupta can not say the glory of the lamp and the fruits of awakening
 jo is ekadshi kii raatri ko bhagwaan ke mandir main deepak jalaate hai unke pitar swarglok main amritpan karte hai tathaa jo ghi yaa tel kaa deepak jalaate hai, ve sau karod dipakon se prakashit hokar surya lok ko jate hai
 Brahma says, o Narada! This Kamika Ekadashi fasting should be done diligently to destroy the sins of Brahm slaughter and feticide
 kamika ekadshi ke vrath kaa mahatmaya shraddha se sunne or padhane vaala manushya sabhi paapon se mukt hokar vishnu lok ko jaataa he
 The fruit which is obtained from the bathing of Ganga, Kashi, Naimisharanya and Pushkar, is obtained by worshiping Lord Vishnu
 jo fal surya va chandra grahan par kurukshetra or kaashi main snaan karne se, samudr, van sahit prithvi daan karne se, singh raashi ke brihaspati main godavari or gandaki nadi main snaan se bhi praapt nahin hota vah bhagwaan vishnu ke pujan se miltaa he
 Those who worship God in Shravan, God, Gandharva and Surya etc
 are all worshiped by them
 at: paapon se darane vaale manushyon ko kamika ekadshi kaa vrath or vishnu bhagwaan kaa pujan avashyamev karnaa chahie
 The fast of this Ekadashi and worship of Lord Vishnu is very important for people trapped in the mud of sin and immersed in the ocean of the world
 isse badhkar paapon ke naashon kaa koi upaay nahin he
 Hey Narada! God Himself has said that the creature does not get Kuyoni by fasting
 jo manushya is ekadshi ke din bhakthipurvak tulsi dal bhagwaan vishnu ko arpan karte hai, ve is sansar ke samast paapon se dur rahete hai
 Lord Vishnu is not so happy with the gemstone, pearl, gem and jewelery etc
 as much as the Tulsi group
