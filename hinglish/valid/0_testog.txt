 koi bhi vastu upar se girane par sidhi prithvi kii ore aati he
 It seems as if some untargeted and unknown power is pulling him towards the earth
 italy ke vaigyanik, gallilyyo gallilyaai ne sarvapratham is tathy par prakaash daalaa tha ki koi bhi pind jab upar se girtaa he tab vah ek niyat twaran se prithvi kii ore aata he
 This value of acceleration remains the same for all objects
 apane is nishkarsh kii pushti usne prayogon or ganitiya vivechanon dwaara kii he
 After this Sir Isaac Newton based on his fundamental discoveries that not only the earth, but every particle of the world keeps attracting every other particle towards itself
 do kanon ke bich kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal un kanon kii sanhatiyon ke gunanfal kaa samaanupati tathaa unke bich kii duuri ke varg kaa vyutkramanupati hota he
 The mutual attraction between the particles acting on gravity and the force generated by it is called the force of gravity
 newton dwaara pratipaadit uparyukt niyam ko newton kaa gurutvkarshan niyam kehete hai
 Sometimes this law is also called the "inverse square law of gravity"
 uparyukt niyam ko sutara rup main is prakaar vyakt kiya ja saktaa he : maan liya m1 or sanhati vaale m2 do pind paraspar d duuri par sthit hai
 The value of the force f acting between them will be: yahan g ek samaanupati niyatank he jiskaa maan sabhi padaarthon ke liye ek jaisaa rahata he
 This is called gravitational constant
 is niyatank kii vimaa he or aankik maan prayukt ikai par nirbhar karata he
 By the formula, the force of attraction caused by the earth on a body can be calculated
 maan lijie prithvi kii sanhati m he or iske dharaatal par m sanhati vaala koi pind padaa hua he
 If the Earth's body is to be condensed at its center and the radius of the Earth is r, then the attraction force acting by the body on that body: newton ke dwitiya gatinium ke anusaar kisi pind par laganevaala bal us pind kii sanhati tathaa twaran ke gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 Thus, the force of gravity acting on a body falling freely under the influence of the attraction of the Earth: jahaan g us pind kaa gurutvajanit twaran he, at: That is, g = the force acting on the unit code of the body
 kintu sameekaran se Hence gravitational acceleration g is also often called the intensity of gravity of 'earth'
 newton dwaara gurutvkarshan ke niyam kaa pratipaadan hone ke baad hi gurutv niyatank g kaa maan gyaat karne kii samasya ne vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan apni ore aakrisht kiya
 The reason for this was that it is one of the basic determinants of nature and is completely different from country, time and situation
 isliye ise saarvatrik niyatank kehete hai
 Also, it can also be related to the Code of the Earth
 at: prithvi kii sanhati evam ghanatv gyaat karne ke liye bhi iske maan ke gyaan kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 This will be clear from the following deliberation: sameekaran or main tulana karne par But the amount of earth jahaan d prithvi kaa madhya ghanatv he
 g = g p r3 d / r2 = g pr d arthath G
 D
 = 3 g / It is clear from this formula that to find the value of one of the g or D, the value of the other must be known
 atev prithvi kaa ghanatv gyaat karne se purv g kaa thik maan gyaat kar sakane kii vidhiyon kii ore vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan aakrisht hona swaabhaavik hi tha
 We can divide the scientific efforts made to find the value of gravity constant in three categories: is vidhi kaa avlamban karanevaalon main bugar nevil meskeline airi tathaa phon sternek ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Its principle is summarized as follows: maan lijie m sanhati kaa koi pind prithvi dwaara aakarshith ho rahaa he
 It is obvious that this attraction force will be equal to the weight w of that body
 ab yadi us pind par ek parshvik bal bhi, kisi anya brihatkaay prakritik pind dwaara lag rahaa ho to newton ke niyamanusaar parshvik bal f = f m m ' / d2 xxrep 8 


 
 yahan m’ us brihatkaay prakritik pind kii sanhati tathaa d uske tathaa chote pind ke bich kii duuri he
 If the radius of the Earth is r w = g μ r3 Dm / r2 = mμ r xxrep 11 
 On comparing equations and w / f = r d2 d / m’ meaning d = 3m’ / 4p r d2 d 
 xxrep 17 
 is sameekaran main g nahin aata
 Therefore, if other quantities are known, the mean density d of the earth will be known
 w / f kaa maan alag kai prayogon dwaara gyaat kar liya jaataa he
 Again in place of m in the equation, mg / g ie rakhane par is sameekaran se g kaa maan gyaat ho jaayga
 In 1740 AD, Booger conducted two types of experiments and tried to find the length of the second pendulum and the value of g at different heights
 ek sthaan to dakshini america ke piru naamak desh main quito naamak pathaar par chunaa
 For the difference in the altitudes of these two places, he revised the value of g obtained at sea level: for this he assumed that there was only air in between the two heights
 is prakaar gananaa dwaara pathaar ke liye praapt g ke maan or prayog dwaara praapt maan main 1 / 6983 gune kaa antar paaya
 Booger concluded that this difference was due to the attraction of the Bhupadartha contained in the 9400 feet high plateau
 is prayog ne yah sanket diya ki sampurna prithvi kaa aakarshan us pathaar ke aakarshan kaa 6983 guna he
 By calculating the attraction of the plateau, Booger estimated that the density of the Earth is 4
7 times the density of the plateau
 meskeline ne 1774 i
 main ek doosraa prayog kiya
 He set up two centers very close to the steep slopes on the north and south sides of Mount Shehalian, in the province of Perthshire, Scotland, which fall on the same meridian

 He put a plumb in a telescope and measured the meridian meridians of many constellations from both places

 In time, with the help of this result, Charles Hutton obtained a conclusion of 5 and 9 in the density of mountains and earth

 Airy made another experiment in 1854 AD at the Harton mine in the Southshields province of England, which was actually a modified form of the use of booger

 It can be understood as: Suppose the density of ghosts from the center of the earth to the bottom of the mine is d and from there to the top of the mine, the density of ghosts is d
 yadi khan ke upar tathaa tali main gurutvkarshan kii tivrata kaa maan kramash: ga or gb ho to gb = g r3 d / r2 = g r d

 is vidhi kaa anusaran karne waalon main phon jolly, pointing aadi ke naam ullekhneey hai
 The goal was to find the value of gravity by finding the increase in the weight of the smaller body by bringing any other heavy body under it
 iskaa siddhant is prakaar he : Suppose a body of m samhita is hung by a wire from one arm of a very sensitive balance
 yadi prithvi kii sanhati m tathaa ardhavyas r ho to us pind par kaary karne vaala gurutvkarshan bal w = GM m / r2 xxrep 12 
 ab is pind ke neeche yadi m sanhati kaa koi anya baari pind laakar rakhaa jaay or donon pindon ke kendron ke bich kii duuri d ho to donon ke parsparik aakarshan ke kaaran pehla pind adhik neeche kii ore jhuk jaayga arthath uskaa bhaar bad jaayga
 Suppose this increase in weight is dw w’ = g m m’ / d2 xxrep 12

 is sameekaran se prithvi kii sanhati m gyaat ho jaaygi or is maan ko sameekaran main rakhane par g kaa maan gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 The value of g can also be determined by another method
 ham jaanate hai ki mg = GM m / r2 yaa g = g m / r2 g = g r2 / m yahan g kaa maan second lolak dwaara gyaat kiya ja saktaa he

 a special type of mirror was used in this arrangement which increased the bending of the pedicle by 150 times
 yah pehle hi alag prayogon ke dwaara gyaat kar liya gaya tha ki tandi kitne bhaar ke liye kitni jhukati he
 From this, it was calculated by how much force the bending in the pedicle was caused by mutual attraction between the two spheres
 is bal ke pariman ko gurutvkarshan sameekaran f = g m1 m2 / d2 main prayukt kar g kaa maan gyaat kar liya gaya
 Henry Cavendish and Sir Charles Vernon Boys are notable names in this category of endeavors
 vastut: cavendish hi vah pratham vyakti tha jisane gurutv niyatank kaa maan adhik vishwawast seemaa tak thik-thik gyaat kar sakane kii utkrisht prayogshaala vidhi kaa anusaran kiya
 Boys contributed significantly to making this method more sophisticated and simple

 If the quantities of the small and large bodies are m and m respectively and for the unit deflection, the force of the spasm of the wire is, then in the equilibrium state, the gravitational force of the wire is the spasm of the wire spasm
 t ho to santulan kii sthiti main, gurutvkarshan kaa balyugma = taar kii anthan kaa balyugma That is, g m m ' / d2 ́1 = T

 Therefore t = 4 p2i / T2 And by putting this value in the formula of g g = 4 p2 Id2 / mm’ i The value of g can be found when other quantities are known
 apane prayog main cavendish ne bada pind 169 kilogram kaa, chota pind 780 gram tathaa nilamban taar 1 meter lanbaa liya tha
 To get more accurate results, he first placed the heavier bodies on both sides of the smaller bodies, as shown in Figure 1 full circle
 iske baad bade pidon ko duusare parshvon main rakhaa, jaisaa binduon se pradarshit vritton dwaara dikhaaya gaya he

 In addition, many errors can be resolved

 The experimental arrangement of the boys can be understood by Figure 2 below
 isamen ek atyant chota ytaakar darpan da tandi ke sthaan par prayukt kiya gaya tha
 Two small round 'A' and 'B' were hung from the legs of the quartz which had a vertical distance of about 6 "

 The larger spheres were previously placed adjacent to the smaller spheres in such a way as shown by the full circle in the figure
 isse darpan da main ek or vikshep hua
 Again the large spheres were brought to the positions shown by the dots which caused the small spheres to be attracted in opposite directions and this time the mirror was deflected on the opposite side
 gyatavya he ki samtal darpan main vikshep hone par paravartit kirnon main uskaa duuna vikshep utpann hota he
 This deflection is measured by the lamp and the ruler system
 iske liye ek maapni darpan se 7 meter dur rakhi gai thi or usee ke neeche kuch hatakar, deep rakhaa gaya tha
 Main article - Gravity of the Earth prithvi ke nikat sthit prayek pind prithvi dwaara prithvi ke centre kii ore aakarshith hota he
 This attraction force is called the weight of the body
 yadi koi pind prithvi se upar le jaakar choda jaay or us par kisi prakaar kaa anya bal kaary na kare to vah sidhaa prithvi kii ore girtaa he or uskaa veg ek niyat kram se badhata jaataa he
 In this way, the acceleration or acceleration produced in a body due to the attraction force of the Earth is called gravity acceleration

 ganit main sankhyaon ke kisi anukram ke yoga ko shrenee kehete hai
 If the number of posts is infinite, then this category is called infinite series
 yadi diya hua anukram { a 1 , a 2 , a 3 , 


 } { \ displaystyle \ left \ {a_{1}, \ a_{2}, \ a_{3}, \ dots \ right \ }} he to, anukram ke pehle n padon ke yoga s n { \ displaystyle S_{n}} ko nvaz aanshik yoga kehete hai
 Ie koi shrenee abhisari tab kehalaati he jab iske aanshik yogon kaa anukram { s 1 , s 2 , s 3 , 


 } { \ displaystyle \ left \ {S_{1}, \ S_{2}, \ S_{3}, \ dots \ right \ }} abhisari ho
 When there is no convergence, it is called diverging
 mana Sn = a1+


+an is shrenee ke pratham padon n padon kaa yoga he
 If Sn is moving towards a finite boundary s when n is leading to infinity, the range is called 'convergent towards S' and s is called 'sum of series'
 yadi Sn agrasar hota he +anant yaa -anant kii ore, to shrenee paristhiti ke anusaar + anant yaa - anant kii ore apsaarit hoti kahi jaati he
 If Sn oscillates finitely, ie if for every n
 Sn
 <K and if Sn does not move towards a boundary, the range is said to oscillate finitely
 yadi n ke anant kii ore agrasar hone par,
 Sn
 aparimit rahata he or Sn kisi seemaa kii ore agrasar nahin hota, to shrenee anant rup se dolit hoti kahi jaati he
 For example, for the range 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 


 according to whether n is even or odd, Sn = 0 or 1
 at: yah shrenee parimit rup se dolit he
 For the range 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + xxrep 4 
 S2n = n is S2n-1 = n and this range oscillates infinitely
 at: kisi shrenee kaa abhisaran, yaa apsaran apurna yogon {sn} ke anukram ke abhisaran, yaa apsaran, par nirbhar hota he
 Generally, the category that does not converge is called non-convergence
 gunottar shrenee 1 + r + r2 + 


 ke liye Sn = / yadi |r| < 1 ; tathaa Sn = n yadi r = 1 he
 If
 r
 <1, this range converges to sum 1, otherwise remains untouched
 s ke liye nishchit vyanjak gyaat karnaa sadaiv saral nahin he
 Therefore, we use the test methods of convergent and divergent to know whether a particular category is convergent or not
 yadi koi shrenee keval dhanatmak padon se bani he, to kisi pad ke uparaant {sn} ek vriddhimay anukram hoga or aise vriddhimay anukram ke abhisaran ke liye aavashyak or paryaapt anubandh yah he ki yah parimit ho, arthath ek aisi achar raashi k kaa astitv ho ki n ke samast maanon ke liye Sn < k ho

 percepolis, akmenide samrajya kii aupchaarik rajdhani thi
 Persepolis is located 70 km northeast of Shiraz, the current city of Fars Province in modern-day Iran
 samakaleen farsi main is sthaan ko takht-e jamshid tathaa parseh ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The earliest remains of Persepolis date to around 515 BCE
 pracheen farsi log is shahar ko parsa ke naam se jaanate the jiskaa arth he "farsiyon kaa shahar"
 percepolis, unani bhashaa ke shabd Πέρσης πόλις kaa ek lipyantaran he
 In 1979, UNESCO declared Persepolis Fort a global heritage site
 puratathvik sakshya se pataa chalata he ki percepolis ke sabase shuruaati avshesh lagbhag 515 ipu puraane hai
 French archaeologist André Goddard, who excavated Persepolis in the early 1930s, believed that the Persepolis site was chosen by Cyrus the Great, while the roof and the massive palaces were built by Darius the Great
 apadana mahal tathaa council haul, pramukh shahi khajaane tathaa uske aasapaas ke parivesh ke nirmaan kaa aadesh dariyas dwaara diya gaya tha
 All these were completed during the reign of his son King Xerxes the Great
 Further construction of the buildings on the roof continued until the fall of the Achaemenid dynasty

, representing the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago
 Was done by Schmidt
 unhone 1930 main shuruyaat karke aath mausamon tak khudaai kii jisamenaasapaas kii anya citen bhi shaamil thim
 Herzfeld believed that the reasons behind the creation of Persepolis included the need to commemorate his kingdom with an impressive atmosphere and special celebrations such as "nowruz"
 aitihaasik kaarnon ke liye, percepolis kaa nirmaan usee sthaan par kiya gaya jahaan akmenide rajvansh kii sthapana hui thi, haalanki us samay par yah samrajya kaa kendra nahin tha
 Persepolis architecture is known for its use of wooden columns
 shilpkaar pattharon kaa istemaal keval tabhi karte jab lebanon ke sabase bade deodaar tathaa bharat ke sagaun ke vriksh bhi unki aakaar sambandhi aavashyaktaaon ko puraa nahin kar pate the
 The bases and spire of the columns were made of stone, even on wooden shafts, but the existence of a wooden spire is also possible
 percepolis kii imaaraton main teen saamaanya samooh shaamil hai: sainya kaksh, koshagaar or swaagat kaksh tathaa raja dwaara kabhi-kabhaar istemaal kiye jane vaale ghar

 Persepolis is located near a small river called Pulver that joins the Kur River
 is site main 125,000 varg meter kii ek chat, jiskaa kuch bhaag kritrim rup se nirmit he or kuch bhaag pahaad se kaat kar banaaya gaya he or iskaa purvi hissaa kuh-e rahamat kii taraf jhukaa hua he
 Its other three parts are constructed by erecting walls whose height varies with the slope of the ground
 pashchimi hisse par 5 se 13 meter kii duuri par ek dohari seedhi dhire se upar kii taraf jaati he
 The pits were filled with heavy rocks attached to clay and metal clips to form a level roof

 It was planned to construct a ladder as the main gate of the roof 20 meters above the ground

 111 charnon vaali is seedhi ke prayek charan ke sataha kii oonchaai 10 centimetre, chaudaai 31 centimetre or lambaai 6

 It was believed that such steps were actually constructed to descend the nobles and royalists by sitting on horseback

 The upper part of the staircase led to a small courtyard located on the north-eastern side of the roof opposite the Gate of Nations
 percepolis main mukhya nirmaan samagriyon ke rup main bhura chuunaa pathar kaa istemaal kiya gaya tha
 The roof was constructed after equalizing the natural rock and filling the pits

 a very high water storage tank was built on the western foothills of the mountain
 profesar olmustid ne bataaya ki kunda kaa nirmaan usee samay kiya gaya tha jis samay minaaron kaa nirmaan shuru hua tha
 The uneven scheme of the foundation of the roof acted like a palace whose slanted walls proved to be helpful in targeting its defenders from any part of the outer front
 Diodorus writes that Persepolis had three walls with percolates, all of which had towers to provide protection space for defense personnel
 pehali diwaar 7 meter lambii thi, duusari 14 meter or chaaron hisson ko cover karne vaali teesri diwaar kii oonchaai 27 meter thi haalaanki aaj vahaan is diwaar kaa koi vajood nahin he
 There are remains of several huge buildings on the roof
 inamen se sabhi gahare-bhure rang ke sangemarmar se bani hai
 Fifteen pillars from their pillars still stand
 1970 ke baad se teen nae khambhon ko phir se khadaa kiya gaya he
 Many of these buildings were never completed

 These ruins are now also known as Takht-e Jamshid - تخت جمشید for which traces of the name Chehel Minar can be found in the thirteenth century
 pietro dela vaile ke samay se is baat par vivaad samaapt ho gaya he ki ve sikandar mahaan dwaara adhikrut or aanshik rup se nasht percepolis kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 There are three tombs behind Takht-e Jamshid which were built by rock cut in the mountainous region
 grih mukhon, jiname se ek adhuraa he, ko nakkashiyon ke saath khub acchhee tarah se sajaayaa gaya he
 About 13 km NNE on the opposite side of Pulver stands a straight rocky wall in which four similar mausoleums have been built at great height from the valley valley
 aadhunik farsi chhidr ke neeche sasanian nakkashiyon se is sthaan ko naksh-e rustam - نقش رستم yaa nakshi rostam kehete hai jise ve puranic nayak rostam ke ek pradarshan ke rup main lete hai
 From these sculptures it can be inferred that the occupants of these seven tombs were kings
 inamen se ek makbare par khude shilaalekh se pataa chalata he ki vah dariyas histoyspis kaa makbara he jiske bare main stacius bataate hai ki unki kabr ek chattan ke chehre yaa saamne vaale hisse kii taraf tha or vahaan keval rassiyon ke sahare hi pahunchaa ja saktaa he
 Stacius mentions of several Persian kings that either his remains were brought "to the Persians" or died there
 samrajya ke vishyon ko sandarbhit karne vaale get of ol neshans main chaar khambhon vaala ek grand haul shaamil tha jo lagbhag 25 meter lambii bhujaaon vaala ek varg tha or iskaa pravesh dwaar pashchimi diwaar kii taraf tha
 There were two more doors, one of which was on the south side which opened towards the abduction yard and the other door on the east side of a long road

 The name of Xerxes was written in three languages and inscribed on the entrances giving everyone information that they had ordered it to be made
 dariyas mahaan ne pashchim kii taraf percepolis main sabase bada or sabase bhavy mahal banwaaya
 is mahal ko apadanaa kaha jaataa tha
 The King of Kings used it for official audiences
 kaam 515 isa purv main shuru hua
 His son Xerxes i completed it 30 years later
 is mahal main ek vargakar grand haul tha jisaki prayek bhujaa 60 me lambii thi or jisamen bahattar khambhe the jinamein se teraa khambhe abhi bhi vistrut manch par sthit he
 The length of each pillar is 19 m, on which is a square Taurus and plinth
 in khambhon par vishaal or baari chat kaa vajan tikaa hua tha
 There were statues of animals on the upper ends of the pillars such as two-headed bulls, lions and eagles
 The pillars were interconnected with the help of blades of oak and deodar brought from Lebanon
 deevaaron ko mitti or stuko kii ek parat se dhank diya gaya tha jisaki gaharaai 5 semi thi jiskaa istemaal plaster ke liye kiya jaataa tha or uske baad use hare stuko se dhank diya gaya tha jo sabhi mehalon main paaya jaataa he
 The eastern, northern and eastern parts of the palace had three rectangular verandahs each with twelve pillars in two of six rows
 grand haul ke dakshin main bhandaran ke liye kamaron kii ek shrinkhalaa kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 Two grand Persepolitan stairs were constructed symmetrical to each other and connected by stone foundations
 kataav se chat ko bachaane ke liye eent kii deevaaron main lambavat naaliyaan banaai gai thi
 Four minarets were built outward in the four corners of the apadana
 deevaaron par taaliyaan lagaai gai thi or unhen singhon, sandon or phulon kii tasveeron se sajaayaa gaya tha
 Darius ordered his name and description of his empire to be written on plates of gold and silver which were placed in stone boxes covered in foundations under the four corners of the palace
 stareey antar kii kshatipurti ke liye apadanaa ke uttari or purvi bhujaaon par do percepolitan style samamit sidhiyon kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 There were two other stairs in the middle of the building
 mahal ke bahari saamne ke drishyon ko anhri, raajaaon ke kuleen guard, kii tasviren banaai gai thim
 The construction of the northern staircase was completed during the reign of Darius but the second staircase was completed much later
 apadanaa, teras kii duusari sabase badi imaarat or antim mehalon ke aage thron haul yaa imperial armys haul of honor he
 The construction of this 70x70 square meter hall was started by Xerxes and in the fifth century BC
 Was eventually completed by his son Artazarxis I
 iske aath pathar ke daravaajon ko dakshin or uttar kii taraf singhaasana ke drishyon kii nakkashiyon se sajaayaa gaya he or purv or pashchim kii taraf rakshason ke saath raja ko ladate hue dikhaae gaye drishyon se sajaayaa gaya he
 Two huge stone bulls lie on the northern side of the north

 In the beginning of the reign of Xerxes the Throne Hall was mainly used to welcome military commanders and representatives of all the subjugated nations of the empire
 baad main thron haul kaa istemaal ek shahi sangrahalay ke rup main kiya jane laga
 Other palaces were also built there

 It is generally accepted that Cyrus the Great was buried in the passerby
 agar yah sach he ki cambises dwitiya ke sharir ko "farsiyon ke liye" ghar laayaa gaya tha, to use dafnane kaa sthaan jarur kahin na kahin uske pita kii kabr ke bagal main hona chahie
 stacius kaa maananaa he ki yah rivaaj tha ki raja ko apane jivan kaal main hi apane liye makbara banvaanaa padataa tha
 Hence the kings buried at Naqsh-e Rustom may perhaps include Darius the Great, Xerxes I, Artazerxis i and Darius II
 kaaphi kam samay tak shashan karne vaale zarksis dwitiya ko shaayad hi aisa shandaar makbara praapt hua hoga or jabardastee kabza karne vaale sogdiyanas ke saath bhi aisa hua hoga
 to takht-e jamshid ke peeche sthit do sampoorn kabr artaperxis dwitiya or artaperxis tritiy ke honge
 adhuraa kabr shaayad arsis of faras kaa ho saktaa he jinhone do saal tak shashan kiya tha or agar yah kabr unka nahin he to vah dariyas tritiy kaa hoga jo unamem se ek he jinke bare main kaha jaataa he ki unke shavon ko "farsiyon ke liye" laayaa gaya tha
 Another small group of ruins of the same style have been found in the village of Hajjabad which is situated on the Pulver from where it can take a good time to travel to Takht-e Jamshid
 inase keval ek imaarat bani thi jo 900 saal pehle tak kaayam tha or uskaa istemaal us samay ke maujuuda istakhar shahar ke masjid ke rup main kiya jaataa tha
 Cyrus the Great was buried in the pasargadae which Stacius describes as his city
 chunki shilalekhon ke aadhaar par faisla karne par percepolis ke imaaraton kii shuruyaat dariyas pratham ke saath hui thi isliye yah sambhawatah is raja ke adheen tha jiske saath yah shahi makaan kii ek nai shakha tak chalaa gaya jisase percepolis ekadam se faras kii rajdhani ban gaya
 However a remote location in a difficult alpine region as the residence of the rulers of the empire was far from convenience
 sahi myne main susa, babylon or ekbatanaa is desh kii rajdhani thi
 This shows that the Greeks were not familiar with this city until Alexander the Great took possession of it and plundered it here
 us samay sikandar ne "mehalon" yaa "mahal" ko jala diya tha jise ab takht e jamshid ke khandhiron ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Stolz's investigation reveals that at least one of these, the palace built by Xerxes, gives evidence of its destruction
 clitarcus ke baad deodoras dwaara varnit ilaaka mahatvapurn byore kii drushti se udhaaharan ke liye purv main pahaad dwaara samarthit hone ke naate takht e jamshid se sambandh rakhata he
 The relevant excerpts from ancient scholars on this subject are given below: haalaanki isamen bhi ek durjey kathinaayee he
 Diodorus states that the rock at the back of the palace containing royal tombs is so steep that the bodies could only be transported to their final resting place by mechanical equipment
 yah baat takht e jamshid ke peeche sthit kabron ke bare main sach nahin he jahaan tak jaisaa ki epa
 stols ne spasht rup se dekha he, koi bhi aasaani se chadh saktaa he
 On the other hand the same is true of the tombs of naqsh-e-rustom
 stols ne tadnusaar is siddhant kii shuruyaat kii ki paresepolis kaa shahi mahal naksh e rustam ke kaaphi kareeb sthit tha or yah samay ke saath mitti ke niraakaar dehron main villin ho gaya he jiske neeche khandhar chupe ho sakate hai
 However, the huge ruins and roof of takht-e-jamshid, which was built so hard, can hardly be anything other than the ruins of palaces; For example, the Persians had no such thing, at least during the time of Darius and Xerxes
 iske alaava, kaaphi puraani farsi parampara ke anusaar us kshetra main keval teen vaastu chamatkaaron ke hone kii jaankaree mili thi jiskaa shrey shandaar mahani humgi, pasargadaaye main sirus kii kabr, hajjlabad kii imaarat or mahaan chat ko diya gaya
 Therefore, the identification of these last structures with the royal palaces destroyed by Alexander is the safest
 clitarcus, jinhone shaayad hi kabhi khud is mahal ko dekha hoga, apane saamaanya laaparvaah andaaj main mehalon ke peeche kii kabron ko naksh e rustam kii kabr samaj liya; vastav main vah aisa sochataa prathit hota he ki sabhi shahi kabren ek hi sthaan par hai
 After the invasion of Persia, Alexander the Great 330 BC
 i sent my army's main legion to Persepolis by royal road
 Alexander stormed the Persian gates and then captured Persepolis's treasury before it was looted
 kai maheenon ke baad sikandar ne apane sainikon ko percepolis ko luutane kii anumati di
 zarksis ke purvi mahal main aag lag gai or shahar ke shesh hisson main fail gai
 It is not clear whether this was an accident or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second hellenic-persians War

 But Champurichayas have given importance to their free will and personal interest in the combination of both, by not paying special attention to this psychological feature
 gadhy-padya kaa sanmishran sanskrit sahitya main pracheen he, parantu kavyastylee main nibaddh, "champu" kii sangya kaa adhikari gadhy-padya kaa samanjas mishran utana pracheen nahin mana ja saktaa
 The compositions of prose-verse are available in Krishna Yajurvedic codes
 pali jaatakon main bhi gadhy main kathanak tathaa padya main mul sutratmak sanketon kii uplabdhi avashya hoti he
 But being devoid of poetry, we cannot consider them as "champu" in any way

 The description of the various religious, economic and social subjects of that era in the book is indicative of the comprehensive and multi-faceted worship of Somprabhasuri
 ram tathaa krishna ke charit kaa avlamban kar anek pratibhashali kaviyon ne apni pratibha kaa ruchir pradarshan kiya he
 Among such champu poems, Bhojraj's Ramayana Champu, Anantabhatta's "bharat Champu", Shesh Krishna's "parijataharan Champu" are quite famous
 bhojraj ne ramayana champu kii rachana kiskindha cond tak hi kii thi, jisaki purti lakshmana bhatta ne "yukand" kii tathaa venkatraj ne "uttar cond" kii rachana kar kii thi
 Like Jain poets, Chaitanya Mataavalambi Vaishnava poets adopted this fine poetry medium with great success to spread their principles
 bhagwaan shrikrishna kii lalaam lilaon kaa prasang aisa hi sundar avasar he jab in kaviyon ne apni aloksaamanya pratibha kaa prasad apane champu kaavyon ke dwaara bhakt pathakon ke saamne prastut kiya

 Thus, despite being a popular medium for many centuries for the manifestation of sentiments in Sanskrit literature, Champu poetry could not be stagnant in North Indian language literature

 bhashavigyaan main 'akshar' yaa shabdaansh dhvaniyon kii sangathit ikai ko kehete hai
 Any word can be spoken by breaking it into fractions and syllables are the parts of the word that cannot be made any shorter, otherwise the sounds of the word are changed
 udhaahrantah 'achaanak' shabd ke teen shabdaansh hai - 'a', 'chaa' or 'nak'
 If 'a-cha-nak' is spoken intermittently, the three syllables of the word can be seen fragmentarily but the pronunciation of the word seems to be correct
 agar 'nak' ko aage todaa jaae to shabd kii dhvaniyaan galat ho jaatin hai - 'a-chaa-na-k'
 is shabd ko 'a-chaan-k' bhi nahin bolaa jaataa kyonki is se bhi uccharan galat ho jaataa he
 Some short words have the same syllable, such as 'in', 'ear', 'hand', 'walk' and 'ja'
 Some words have two syllables, such as 'walker', food, handkerchief and vegetable
 kuch main teen yaa us se bhi adhik shabdaansh hote hai, jaise 'mahatvapurn' or 'antarrashtriya' 
 The word Akshar means - 'which cannot happen, nor can be destroyed'
 iskaa prayog pehle 'vaani' yaa 'vaak' ke liye evam shabdaansh ke liye hota tha
 The letter continued to be used for 'varna' as well
 yahi kaaran he ki lipi sanketon dwaara vyakt varnon ke liye bhi aaj 'akshar' shabd kaa prayog saamaanya jan karte hai
 Scientific study of the language has given the letter the meaning of English 'syllable', in which vowels, vowels and consonants, including vowels or consonant sounds with reminders, are considered
 ek hi aghat yaa bal main boli jane vaali dhwani yaa dhwani samudaay kii ikai ko akshar kaha jaataa he
 The basis of unit separation is the vowel or vowel consonant
 vyanjan dhwani kisi uccharan main swar kaa purv yaa par ang banakar hi aati he
 Astu, the vowel in the letter is the spine
 akshar se swar ko na to pruthak hi kiya ja saktaa he or na bina swar yaa swararat vyanjan ke akshar kaa nirmaan hi sambhav he
 If the consonant is like a pearl in pronunciation, the vowel is like a thread
 yadi swar shashakt samraat he to vyanjan ashakt raja
 It is on this basis that a letter is often considered synonymous with vowels, but it is not so, yet vowels have great importance in letter formation
 katipay bhashaaon main vyanjan dhvaniyaan bhi akshar nirmaan main sahaayak siddh hoti hai
 In English, consonant sounds like Na, Su and l are also pronounced vowrat and help in syllable formation like vowel sounds
 angreji silabal ke liye hindi main akshar shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Dr
 Ramvilas Sharma has used the word 'swarik' for syllable
 
 Since the word alphabet has been used for many meanings in the history of language and grammar, its use in the meaning of syllable leads to the possibility of confusion
 shabd ke uccharan main jis dhwani par shikharata yaa ucchata hoti he vahi akshar yaa silabal hota he, jaise haath main aa dhwani par
 This word has a letter
 'akalpit' shabd main teen akshar hai - a, kal, pit ; aazaadee main teen - aa ja di; arthath shabd main jahaan jahaan swar ke uccharan kii pruthakta pai jaae vahaan-vahaan akshar kii pruthakta hoti he
 When considered from the point of view of sound production, the unit of pleural circulation is called syllable or vocal, which has the same sound
 sharir rachana kii drushti se akshar yaa swarik ko phuffus spandan bhi kah sakate hai, jiskaa uccharan dhwani tantra main avarodhan hota he
 When the component is highest in the movement letter at the time of pronunciation of the sound block or the lowest sound group, then that sound is alphabetic
 swar dhvaniyaan bahudhaa aksharvat uccharit hoti he evam vyanjan dhvaniyaan kvachit
 The absolutely separate unit of lexical pronunciation is called a letter, as kisi shabd main aksharon kii sankhya is baat par katai nirbhar nahin karti ki usamen kitni dhvaniyaan hai, balki is baat par ki shabd kaa uccharan kitne aghat yaa jatke main hota he arthath shabd main kitni avyavhit dhwani ikaiyaan hai
 In addition to the head sound used in the letter, the remaining sounds are called ‘aksharang’ or ‘gahvar sound’
 udhaaharan ke liye 'chaar' main ek akshar he jisamen aa sheersh dhwani tathaa c evam r gahvar dhvaniyaan hai
 In any syllable there is a 'syllabus center', which is always the vowel character and other characters are found around it which can be consonants and also vowels
 The syllable center of the syllable 'ear' is the vowel of 'aa', from which the letters 'a' and 'n' come later
