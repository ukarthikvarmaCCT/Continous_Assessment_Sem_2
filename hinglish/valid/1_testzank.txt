 Not being an epic or a heavy poem, Adahmana did not have the opportunity to describe things in a small way, yet the poeticness, restraint and gentleness that the poet has introduced are his poetic power, erudition, tradition-knowledge and folklore
 The full prestige of this places in the reader's heart

 unhone ‘sandesh-raasak’ kaa pranayan, saadhaaran janon ko drushti main rakhkar, unke anand or vinod ke liye kiya tha, panditon or vidwaanon ke liye nahin
 This poem is inspired by Meghdootam composed by Kalidasa

 iskaa taatpary yah he ki a, u or m pranav ke in teen avyavon kaa atikaraman karne par arthtatv kaa avashya hi bhed ho jaataa he

 is upanishad main jeevatma or brahmalok, pranopasna, agnihotra, vividh upasnaayen, praantatv kii mahima tathaa surya, chandra, vidyut megh, akaash, vaayu, agni, jal, darpan or pratidhwani main vidyaman chaitanya tatv kii upasna par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 Finally, the nature of 'self-realization' and the fruit derived from its worship is considered
 pratham adhyay main gautam rishi evam garg rishi ke praputra chitra ke sanvaadon dwaara 'brahmagyaan' ke liye kiye jane vaale agnihotra tathaa uski falshruti par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 When the seeker reaches Brahmaloka after his death, he is confronted by Apsaras and Brahmaji seated on a strange wall
 vah unase baaten karata he
 This conversation is also known as 'pravink-vidya'
 garg rishi ke praputra, maharishi chitra, yajna karne kaa nishchay karke arun ke putr mahatma uddalak ko pradhan ruthvik ke rup main aamantrit karte hai, parantu muni uddalak swayan na jaakar apane putr shwethaketu ko yajna sampann karaane ke liye bhej dete hai
 Shwetketu arrives at the behest of his father and sits on a high seat
 tab chitra usase prashn karata he-'he gautamakumar! is lok main koi aisa aavarnayukt sthaan he, jahaan tum mujhe le jaakar rakh sakate ho yaa phir usamen bhi koi aisa sarvatha pruthak or vilakshan aavaran se shunya pad he, jisko jaanakar tum usee lok main mujhe pratishthit kar sakate ho?' Saying this, Shwetketu left the posture of sacrifice and asked his father - 'oh Father! How should i answer the question that Maharishi Chitra has asked me? Shwetketu repeated the question of the picture to his father
 tab uddalak rishi ne kaha-'putr! main bhi iskaa uttar nahin jaanata
 Both of us will achieve this learning only by walking into the Yajshala of Maharishi Chitra and studying it
 'tadnantar donon pita-putr prasiddh aaruni muni ke haath se samidha grahan karke jigyaasu-bhav se maharishi chitra ke paas gayi or kaha ki ve vidya-prapti hetu unke paas aaye hai
 The picture said- 'O Gautam! You are highly revered among Brahmins and possess theology; Because coming to me, you do not have even a little pride of your superiority
 main nishchay hi aapako iskaa bodh karaungaa
 Maharishi Chitra said- 'O Vipraver! The person who is going to perform the rituals of Agnihotri, they all go from this world towards Chandralok, that is, heaven, but the person who is enamored of heavenly happiness accepts Chandralok, all his virtues are destroyed and he again : Falls back to this earth, that is, he is reborn again
 use moksh nahin mil paata
 On the saying of Maharishi Chitra, Gautam Muni again asked - "O God! Tell me who i am Tell me the way to cross this Bhavsagar, so that i can be free from all the buildings
 ' maharishi chitra ne kaha-'he gautam! devyan maarg se jane vaala sadhak kramash: agnilok, vayulok, suryalok, varunalok, indralok va prajapatilok aadi chah lokon main se hota hua 'brahmalok' main pravesh kar paata he
 There is a large reservoir named 'ar' at the entrance of 'brahmaloka'
 yah jalashay kaam, krodh, moh aadi shatruon dwaara nirtit he
 Here, even a moment's ego and bondage of work, anger, greed etc
 destroy all the virtues of the seeker
 'isht' kii prapti main yah jalashay sabase badi baadha he, parantu jo ise paar kar letaa he, vah phir se paavan viraja nadi ke kinare pahunch jaataa he
 All his labor and old age are overcome by mere sight of Virja river
 usamen aage 'ilya' naamak vriksh aata he
 This is the city with beautiful groves, gardens, baoli, koop, lake, river and reservoir etc
 of many deities, which is surrounded by Virja river and crescent park
 ye sabhi man ko baar-baar mohane ke liye saamne aate hai, kintu jo sadhak inamen lipt na hokar aage bad jaataa he, use saamne hi brahma ji kaa ek vishaal devalayas dikhaai padataa he
 The name of this temple is 'aparajita'
 surya kii prakhar rashmiyon se yukt hone ke kaaran ise vijit karnaa atyant kathin he
 It is protected by the clouds, the yajna, the air and the sky-form Indra and Prajapati, but the one who defeats them enters Brahmaloka
 vahaan ek vishaal vaibhav-sampann sabha-mandap ke madhya 'vichkshna' naamak vedi par sarvashaktimaan pranaswaroop brahma ji ek ati sundar singhaasana par virajman dikhaai padate hai
 Apsaras named Vishwa Janani Amba and Ambavayvi are engaged in their service, who welcome the Brahmavetta seeker and ornate him and present him to Brahma Ji
 'is upanishad main ek atyant sundar roopak baandhakar devyan maarg se brahmalok tak pahunchane kaa maarg dikhaaya gaya he
 It is here that the sage says that the man traveling in the chariot sees the wheels of the chariot running, but he does not see the coincidence of the speed of the wheels from the ground
 isi prakaar brahmalok kii yatra karne vaala sadhak rath par baithkar din or raat ko to dekhtaa he, kaal kii gati ko bhi dekhtaa he, paap-punya ko bhi dekhtaa he, parantu vah unamem lipt nahin hota
 He attains 'brahma' only by staying away from them
 kaam, krodh, lobh, moh or ahankaar uske maarg ke baadhak nahin banataa
 Maharishi's picture further says - 'O Gautam! The seeker becomes a Brahmavetta and experiences Brahmagandha, Brahmaras, Brahmatej, Brahmayash and Brahmnad in all his senses
 tab brahma ji us brahmagyani se prashn karte hai-'tum koun ho?' us samay brahma ji dwaara puche gayi prashnon kaa uttar brahmagyani ko is prakaar dena chahie— In this way, after answering all the questions of Brahma Ji, Lord Brahma himself says to the seeker that the famous 'five great' waters are my place
 at: yah meraa lok bhi jal aadi tatva dwaara pradhan he
 You are my worshiper integral to me
 at: yah tumhaara bhi lok he
 'thus that seeker acquires both' Jiti 'and' Vyushti 'of Brahma
 'maharishi chitra ne is prakaar 'brahmagyaan' kaa upadesh dekar gautam rishi ko abhibhoot kiya
 Sage Gautama, along with his son Shvetketu, returned after bowing to the Maharishi picture
 is adhyay main 'prantatva' kii upasna or 'brahmavidya' ke vyaavhaarik paksh par prakaash daalaa gaya he
 In addition to this, 'suryopasana' to destroy his sins, for the son's skillful desire and safety, 'chandropasana', 'for good health', Somopasana, 'for salvation,' Pramanapasana 'and the son for his whole life While giving the burden of responsibility, 'sampradan Karma' has described very clearly
 prantatva kii upasnis adhyay main 'praan' ko hi 'brahm' kaa rup mana he
 Pran is conceived as a king
 'man' uskaa doot he, 'vaani' uski rani he, 'chakshu' uski suraksha karne vaale mantri hai, 'karnendriya' sandesh grahan karne vaale dwarpal hai
 As soon as the soul arrives, the service of all senses is automatically received by the king of life
 suprasiddh mahatma shushkabhingaar 'praan' ko hi brahm kaa rup sweekaar karte hai
 Therefore, the worship of life is going to give favored attainments
 jivan main shreshthata, sukh-samruddhi, yash, tejaswita tathaa gyaan pranopasna dwaara ho saktaa he
 Suryopasanakoshitki, through his experience, has said to perform Suryopasana thrice - morning, midday and evening
 unhone kaha he ki praat:kaal yagyopavit ko savy bhav se baayen kandhe par rakhkar aachman karen
 Then fill the water vessel thrice with pure water, offer arghya to the rising sun and chant this mantra - 'vardoshi in Vrgosi papamanam
 ' is prakaar madhyahnkaal main, bhagwaan bhaskar ko samaran karen or is mantra kaa uccharan karen-' udvargosi papmanan main sanvruddhi
 Similarly, in the evening, worship the sun while setting and chant this mantra - 'ॐ Vriddhogऽsī Papamanam
 ' is prakaar suryopasna karne se manushya ke din-raat ke saare paapon kaa shaman ho jaataa he, paap karm na karne kii shakti utpann ho jaati he
 In Chandropasana Avamasya, when the sun is located in the western part and the moon is situated in the moon named Sushumna, then by this method one should perform Chandropasana
 arghya dene vaale paatr main do hari durva ke ankur bhi avashya rakh len
 Then chanting this mantra while offering Arghya - 'yatte Susimam Hridayamadhi Chandramamsishritam Tenamritattasyeshane Mahan Potramyadam Rudam
 ' is prakaar kii prarthana se upaask putr shok se bachaa rahata he tathaa putr na hone kii sthiti main putr-ratna praapt kar letaa he
 Somopasana Rishi has considered Somopasana to be the reason for a healthy body
 vah som se prarthana karata he-'he stri-rupi som! tum purush-rupi surya ke prakaash se vikaas ko praapt ho
 Be helpful in getting food from all sides
 he som! tum saumy gunon se yukt ho
 By attaining the glory of the Sun, your divine juice becomes very beneficial for men
 tum is divya ras kaa seven karne vaale purushon ko pushti do or unke sabhi shatruon kaa paraabhav karaane main puri tarah se sahaayak bano
 Hey Mon! You can help in the attainment of immortality while achieving happiness with fiery glory and set your fame in heaven
 he som! main tumhaari hi gati kaa anugaman karte hue apni dahini bhujaa ko baar-baar ghumata hum
 'the sage calls Soma the five-faced Prajapati
 uskaa ek mukh 'brahman' he, doosraa mukh 'kshatriya' hai, teesraa mukh 'baj' pakshi he, chauthaa mukh 'agni' he
 And the fifth face you are yourself
 is prakaar som kii prarthana karne ke uparant garbhaadhan ke liye tatpar stri ke paas baithne se pehle uske hriday kaa sparsh karen or is mantra kaa paath karen—'yatte sumime hridaye hitmant: prajapathu manyehan maa tadvidwansan ten maahan pautramadhan rudam
 'this kind of prayer never leaves the seeker mourning the son
 rishi kaa sanket us mata kii ore he, jo apana doodh apni santaan ko pilaati he
 His milk has a somerset-like defensive force
 usee se balak swasth rahata he
 Mother's milk is a natural process for the child
 prakruti kaa virodh anekanek bhayanak parinaamon kaa kaaran ban jaataa he
 In the context of worshiping the mortal for salvation, the sage has shown the importance of life through a beautiful metaphor
 ek samay vaani aadi samast devtaa ahankaar ke vasheebhoot hokar apni-apni mahatt siddh karne ke liye paraspar vivaad karne lage
 Everyone was exited from the body with life
 unke nikal jane se sharir kashtha kii bhaanti chetana-rahit hokar so gaya
 'vani' entered the body alone to prove his supremacy
 vaani ke pravesh karte hi sharir vaani se bolne laga, lekin vah apane sthaan se uth nahin sakaa
 After this, the 'netriadriya' deity entered the body
 tab vah vaani se bolne or netron se dekhne laga, parantu is baar bhi vah uth nahin sakaa
 Then the 'shrotendiya' deity entered the body
 vah sunne laga, bolne bhi laga or dekhne bhi laga
 But even this time he could not get up, he was lying idle
 tatpashchaat us sharir main 'man' ne pravesh kiya
 Through the mind he became thinking, but this time also he could not get up
 tab sabase ant main 'praan' ne us sharir main pravesh kiya
 The body got up and sat as soon as that nature entered
 isse praanon kaa mahatva sarvopari siddh ho gayaan sabhi anya indriyon ne praan main hi, moksh aadi sadhana kii shakti ko sweekaar kiya
 He learned that immortality can be attained only by life and this body can rise up and go towards heaven
 praanon ke dwaara hi, sharir kii samast chetnaayen or indriyaan kaary karti hai
 Therefore, it is due to the association of Brahman by the worship of souls
 praanon ke dwaara hi vishisht gyaan-swaroop parabrahm ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Sampradaya-karma by the father This chapter mentions the process of the father's succession to his son
 rishi kaa kahana he ki apana antim samay aayaa jaanakar, pita ko apane sampoorn uttardayitvon se mukt ho janaa chahie or jo kuch bhi uske paas he, use apane putr ko saunp dena chahie
 The son should also gladly accept the obligation left by his father
 pita ko chahie ki shubhr vastra dhaaran karke apane putr ko apane paas bulaaye or usase kahe-'he putr! main tumhen apni vaak shakti, apane praan, apane netra, apane kaan, apane rasaswadan, apane samast shreshth karm, apane sukh-du:kha, apni maithunjnya shakti tathaa rati-sukh, apni gatishiltaa, apni samast icchhaaen, apni buddhi, apana yash, brahmatej ou apana shreshth swasthya tathaa ann ko pachaane kii shakti aadi sabhi sadgun pradaan karata hum yaa tumhaare bheetar pratishthit karata hoon
 'when the father says this, the son should accept him politely and look towards his left shoulder and with his hands, he will say -' Father! You can get the heaven you desire and all the pleasures there
 ' iske uparant, yadi pita nirog ho, to vah apane putr ko ghar kaa swami banaakar athwa maanakar uske saath nivas kare yaa phir sabhi kuch tyagkar va ghar chhodkar sanyas kaa jivan bitaaye
 Such a father is about to turn to the divine when the time comes
 vastav main uttaradhikaar kaa sahi niyam yahi he
 In this chapter, the sage has given a detailed description of Prana, Pragya and Indri and analyzed their mutual relations
 iske liye samvaad-style kaa sahaara liya gaya he
 Here, through the interactions between Indra and Divodas Raja's son Pratardan, Prana has been described as a form of wisdom and has said that public interest is possible only with this wisdom
 ek baar devasur sangram main, devaataaon kii sahaayta ke liye raja divodas ke putr pratardan swarglok gayi the
 Pleased with his unique martial arts and valor, Indra wanted to give him a boon
 is par pratardan ne kaha-'he devraj! jis shreshth var ko aap maanav-jati ke liye param kalyanyukt maanate hon, vaisaa hi koi shreshth var aap swayan hi mujhe pradaan karen
 After listening to Pratardan, Devraj Indra said - 'rajan! There is no person in this world who asks for a bride for the happiness of others
 aap koi aisa var maangen, jo aapke apane liye ho?'is par pratardan ne koi bhi var grahan karne se inkaar kar diya
 Seeing King Pratardan's ascension of truth, Devraj Indra said - "O Rajan! You know me, my true form? This is the best boon for mankind
 'devraj ke is kathan main pratardan ne pahachaanaa ki indra ne na jane kitne pathbhrasht asuron or rishi-muniyon ko dand diya, par ahankarviheen or nishkaami hone ke kaaran indra kaa bal bhi baankaa nahin hua
 Then he understood that the life which is lived, while doing unarmed deeds and outright ego, is only for human welfare
 at: lok-kalyankari vyakti ke liye nirabhimani or nishkaam karmi hona param aavashyak he
 Only such a person can achieve the true nature of Indra, that is, the soul-like soul, and even the greatest of sinful acts cannot affect him
 yadi daivik pravritiyon kii raksha ke liye kisi aattaayi vyakti kaa vadh bhi karnaa pade, to uskaa bhi paap nahin lagata
 Devraj Indra preached to Pratardan and said that whoever recognizes my true nature, never feels a sin; Because, 'I myself am a form of wisdom
 ' indra aage kahata he ki us praan tathaa shreshth gyaan se yukt aatmaswaroop ke rup main prakhyat, mujh indra kii, tum aayu ou amrit-rup se upasna karo
 He makes it clear that age is life, life itself is life and life itself is immortality
 is sharir main jab tak praan he, tabhi tak aayu he
 It is through this nature that the seeker goes to another world and attains the special pleasure of amritattattva
 jo vyakti 'aayu' or 'amrit' ke rup main indra kii upasna karata he, vah is lok main purnayu ko praapt karata he or swarg ke sukhon kaa paan karata he
 The importance of life in the body is of paramount importance
 yadi praan ke rahete sharir kaa koi ang nasht ho jaye, to bhi sharir jivit rahata he, parantu praan ke na rahane par, ek kshan bhi sharir kaa jivit rahanaa asambhav he
 Prana is the person who realizes action power
 praan hi gyaan main pravriti hone kii shakti detaa he
 It has been called 'pragya-swaroop Prana' or 'atma'
 at: jivan ke utthan ke liye pragna-swaroop is praan kii hi upasna kerani chahie
 Pragya and Prana both reside together in the body and leave this body together with the soul
 pranamya parabrahm kaa yahi darshan he or yahi vigyaan he
 This worship is the main source of public welfare
 sushupt avasthaa main, jab manushya soya hua hota he, tab sabhi indriyaan or gyaan, praan main samahit ho jate hai
 But when he awakens, then all kinds of knowledge, coming out of the soul, merge into their senses and the latent senses become aware
 ise upanishad main maranasann vyakti ke udhaaharan se samajhaayaa he
 a person who is in a dying state, his whole consciousness power leaves the senses and merges into the soul
 us samay vah na to sunata he, na dekhtaa he, na bolta he, ne haath-pair hilaa paata he, na uskaa mastishk hi kaam karata he
 This is the position of a meditation practitioner
 parantu jab vah maranasann vyakti rogon se chhutkaaraa paakar pun: jivit ho uthta he athwa vah dhyansth yogi phir se sahaj jivan main laut aata he, tab unki samast indriyaan apane-apane swabhaav ke anusaar phir se sajag ho uthati hai
 Be guided by the mind
 praan hi sarvapratham 'man' ko jaagrath karata he
 He controls and controls all the senses
 man kaa sidhaa sambandh 'pragna' se he or pragna kaa praan se
 In this way Prana, Pragya and Indri are interdependent
 praantatv se hi pragna he or pragna se hi samast indriyon ko sanchaalan hota he
 When 'prana' which is released from the body, it reverses, then at that time, it reverses with all these senses
 vaani sabhi naamon kaa, naak sabhi gandhon kaa, chakshu sabhi roopon kaa, kaan sabhi dhvaniyon kaa or man sabhi dhyansth vishyon kaa parityag kar detaa he
 Therefore, life is the soul, and wisdom is the soul, who resides in this body simultaneously
 sharir kii samast indriyon kaa parichaalan inhen ke dwaara hota he
 It is through wisdom that he attains cognition according to the nature of all the senses
 pragna ke abhaav main sabhi kaa astitv naganya ho jaataa he
 Without Prana or Pragya, no form, subject or sense can be attained
 jis prakaar rath kii nemi aron ke or are rath kii naabhi ke ashrith hote hai, usee prakaar ke samast indriyaan, pragna ke dwaara hi vidyaman hai
 This wisdom or life is the blissful and immortal form of God
 yah na to achche kaam se vruddhi paata he ou na bure kaary se sankuchit hota he
 It is paradoxical
 yah samast lokon kaa adhipati he or sabakaa swami he
 This soul is our soul
 ise jaanakar hi paramatma kii upasthiti ko anubhav kiya ja saktaa he
 In this chapter, based on the conversation between a Brahmin sage named Gargya and the scholar King Ajatshatru of Kashi, the various powers of the universe have been mentioned in the dialogue style and accepted the 'soul' as 'brahma'
 garg gotra main utpann balaaka rishi ke putr kaa naam gargy rishi ke naam se prasiddh tha
 He was a brilliant scholar of the four Vedas
 ushinar pradesh unka nivasasthaan tha
 He often used to travel in different regions of the country
 kabhi matsay desh main, to kabhi kuru-paanchal main rahane pahunch jate the
 Once while wandering, he reached the Dabar of King Ajatshatru, the scholar of Kashi
 vahaan ve atyant ahankaarpurn vaani main raja se bole-'he rajan! main aapako 'brahmatatv' kaa upadesh duungaa
 On saying such a sage of Gargya, Kashi King Ajatshatru said - 'O Vipravar! For your preaching, i will give you a millenium with a good quality
 mujhe to prasannataa he ki ab tak brahmavidya ke shrota or dani ke rup main mithila naresh janak kaa hi naam tha
 Today, you have come to us and enhanced our pride like Videha Rajak
 ' 'brahmatatva' kaa upadesh dete hue rishi gargy or ajatshatru ke madhya is saprkaar vaartalap hua-rishi gargy—'he rajan! is suryamandal main jo antaryami parameshwar sthit he, main brahmabuddhi se usee kii sadhana karata hum
 'ajatashatru —' o Brahman! It's not like this
 yah shwet vastradhari surya to sabhi se mahaan he
 It is the head of all, centered in the highest position
 jo manushya is viraat purush kii is prakaar se aradhana karata he, vah sabase ucch sthiti main pahunchataa he
 'rishi Gargya -' o Rajan! In the lunar circle, who is this transcendental great man, i worship him as Brahman
 'ajatshatru-'he vipravar! aisa nahin he
 This is the king of Soma and this is also the soul of the food main isi prakaar isaki upasna karata hum
 Whoever worships in this way, surely becomes the soul of the grain and the money is filled with grain
 'rishi gargy-'he rajan! vidyut mandal ke antargat yah jo antaryami viraat parabrahm he, main usee kaa upaask hum
 ‘ajatashatru —’ o Vipravar! It's not like this
 main is vidyut ko 'prakaash kii aatma' maanakar isaki upasna karata hum
 Whoever worships in this way, he himself becomes a 'soul' in the form of light
 'rishi gargy-' he rajan! megh mandal main garjana ke rup main vidyaman us antaryami ishwar ko main saakshaat brahm maanata hum
 ‘ajatashatru —’ o Vipravar! Don't say that main shabd kii aatma samajhakar hi is shreshth tatva kii upasna karata hum
 One who worships in this way, he himself becomes the soul of the word
 'rishi gargy ne phir kaha-'he rajan! akaash mandal main pratishthit parabrahm parameshwar kii main avinashi brahm ke rup main upasna karata hum
 'ajatashatru replied -' o Vipravar! i do not want to say anything about this
 yah to purna, pravriti-rahit brahm, sabhi se vishaal he
 Of course i worship it in this form
 jo aise divya brahm kii upasna karata he, vah samast praaniyon main nirvikaar ho jaataa he
 He does not die before time
 'isi prakaar vaarta ko aage badhaate hue gargy rishi ne vayumandal main sthit viraat purush ko brahm kaha, par ajatshatru ne use indra ke shreshth aishwarya se yukt vaikuntha kaha, jahaan kunthaayen nasht ho jaati hai ou vah sadaiv aparajit rahata he
 After that the sage gave the Virat Purush in the Agni Mandala, the Virat Purush present in the hydrosphere, the Virat Purush reflected in the mirror, the sound in the resonance, the phonetic word rising behind the dynamic Virat Purush, the shadow of the bodily, in the body a Virat Purush situated in the heart, a spirit-like soul with wisdom, a Virat Purush in the right eye, Virat Purush in the left eye
 By present as indestructible Brahman, spoke to worship him
 parantu ajatshatru ne kramash: sabhi ko nakaarte hue agni ko dusron kaa prahaar sahan karne vaala 'vishasahi,' jal main sthit brahm ko namdhari jeevatma, pratibimb ko praturup, pratidhwani ko gati kaa abhavayukt, dhvanyatmak shabd ko 'pranaswaroop', sharir kii chaaya ko mrityu-rup, sharir main sthit viraat purush ko prajapati kaa swaroop, pragna se yukt aatma ko yama kaa swaroop, daahine netra main sthit purush ko naam, agni or jyoti kii aatma, baayen netra main sthit purush ko satya, vidyut or tej kaa aatma bataaya or usee rup main unki upasna karne kii baat kahi
 Hearing of Ajatashatru, the sage Garga became silent and accepted Ajatashatru as his guru, but being a Kshatriya, Ajatashatru did not accept making disciples of Brahmin Gargya
 haa, ekaant main unhen unhen brahm kaa gyaan avashya karaayaa
 They took him to a sleeping person and tried to awaken him by calling him by many names, but when he did not wake up, Ajatshatru picked him up by hitting him with a stick
 uske jaagane par ajatshatru ne rishi gargy se kaha-'he vipravar! yah vyakti is prakaar achet hokar kahaan sota tha or kis pradesh main yah tha or ab jaagane ke baad yah kahaan aa gaya he?' rishi gargy is rahasy ko nahin samaj sake, to raja ajatshatru ne pun: kaha-'rishiver! yah purush jahaan sota tha, vah sthaan praan-rupi hridayakamal he
 There is a famous pulse named 'hita'
 uske dwaara hriday kaa vistaar sampoorn naadiyon tak he, jo bal ke hajaarwein bhaag se bhi sookshm he
 In these channels, the male is situated at bedtime
 is soye hue purush ke hriday main sthit 'praan' kaa sabhi indriyon se sambhaav he
 This life is the shell of the soul
 yah pragnavan aatma isi khol main sookshm rup se usee prakaar virajman rahati he, jaise lakdi kii myaan main talwaar rahati he
 This 'soul' activates the entire 'spirituality' when a man is awake
 tab us 'sakshi-rup aatma' kaa sabhi indriyaan anumat sevak kii bhaanti anusaran karti hai
 The knower, who knows this 'soul', like Indra, by destroying all his enemy asuras or sins, attains the best rank of Triloki
 at: 'aatma' ko jaanane ke liye ahankaar kaa tyaag param aavashyak he
 Only then can he destroy his sins

 aadhunik geet kavy main mahadevi ji kaa sthaan sarvopari he
 Due to the current of love and intensity of emotions in his poetry, Triveni flows in his songs like expressions, language and music is rare elsewhere
 mahadevi ke geeton kii vednaa, pranyanubhuti, karunaa or rahasyavaad kavyanuragiyon ko aakarshith karte hai
 But the anti-criticisms of these works confuse the general reader
 aalochakon kaa ek varg vah he, jo yah maanakar chalate hai ki mahadevi kaa kavy nitant vaiyaktik he
 His agony, anguish, compassion, is artificial and artificial
 yah sach he ki mahadevi kaa kavy sansar chhayavaad kii paridhi main aata he, par unke kavy ko unke yug se ekadam asamprukt karke dekhnaa, unke saath anyaay karnaa hoga
 Mahadevi is a conscious creator
 bengal ke akaal ke samay 1943 main inhone ek kavy sankalan prakashit kiya tha or bengal se sambandhit “bang bhu shat vandana” naamak kavita bhi likhi thi
 Similarly, in response to the invasion of China, a collection of poems called Himalaya was edited
 yah sankalan unke yugabodh kaa pramaan he
 Even in the field of prose literature, he did not work less
 unka aalochana sahitya unke kavy kii bhaanti hi mahatvapurn he
 His memoirs are reminiscent of Indian life

 The emergence of Mahadevi Varma in literature happened at a time when the shape of Khadiboli was being refined
 unhone hindi kavita ko brijbhasha kii komalta di, chhandon ke naye daur ko geeton kaa bhandar diya or bhartiya darshan ko vednaa kii hardik sweekruti di
 In this way, he did such an important work in the three fields of language literature and philosophy which influenced an entire generation to come
 shachirani gurtu ne bhi unki kavita ko susajjit bhashaa kaa anupam udhaaharan mana he
 He has created a unique rhythm and simplicity in the composition and language of his songs, as well as a beautiful and natural use of symbols and images that draw a picture in the mind of the reader
 chhayavaadi kavy kii samruddhi main unka yogadan atyant mahatvapurn he
 While Prasad gave naturalization to the Chhayavadi poetry, Nirala embodied the liberation in it and Pant gave him sukomal art, where Mahadevi ji has the distinction of making a life of fame in the background of cinematism
 bhavatmakataa evam anubhuti kii gahanta unke kavy kii sarvaadhik pramukh visheshta he
 Such lively and tangible manifestation of the subtlest subtle expressions of the heart makes the 'mahadevi' among the poetical poets

 His speeches were full of compassion for the common man and firm in the truth
 ve dilli main 1983 main yojit tisare vishwa hindi sammelan ke samaapan samaaroh kii mukhya atithi thim
 This quality of his can be seen in his speech given on this occasion
 yadhyapi mahadevi ne koi upanyaas, kahani yaa naatak nahin likhaa to bhi unke lekh, niabandh, rekhachitr, sansmaran, bhoomikaaon or lalit nibandhon main jo gadhy likhaa he vah shreshthatam gadhy kaa utkrisht udhaaharan he
 There is complete diversity in life
 bina kalpana or kavyarupon kaa sahaara liye koi rachanaakaar gadhy main kitna kuch arjeet kar saktaa he, yah mahadevi ko padhakar hi janaa ja saktaa he
 The ideological maturity in his prose is so relevant that it is still relevant today
 samaaj sudhaar or nari swatantraaa se sambandhit unke vichaaron main dridhtaa or vikaas kaa anupam saamanjasy miltaa he
 Such a sharp vision touching the deepest layers of social life, such a conscious talent to sharply assess the contrast and exploitation of women life, and the unique pictures of the inferior, resourceless beings of the lower class, gave Hindi literature for the first time
 moulik rachanaakaar ke alaava unka ek rup srujanaatmak anuvadak kaa bhi he jiske darshan unki anuwaad-krit ‘saptaparna’ main hote hai
 With the help of his cultural consciousness, he has introduced Hindi poetry in 39 works by identifying Vedas, Ramayana, Theragatha and 39 selected important parts by establishing the works of Ashwaghosh, Kalidas, Bhavabhuti and Jayadeva
 aarambh main 61 prishthiya ‘apni baat’ main unhone bhartiya manisha or sahitya kii is amuly dharohar ke sambandh main gahan shodhapurna vimarsh kiya he jo keval stri-lekhan ko hi nahin hindi ke samgr chintanaparak or lalit lekhan ko samrudh karata he
