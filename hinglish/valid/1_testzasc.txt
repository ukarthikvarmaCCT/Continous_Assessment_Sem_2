 Cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator
 1932 i
 main professor i
 o
 larens ne warkale institute, california, main sarvapratham cychlotron kaa avishkaar kiya
 At present, it is the most powerful tool for instantaneous technique
 cychlotron ke avishkaar ke liye professor larens ko 1939 i
 main "nobel puraskaar" pradaan kiya gaya
 Prior to the inventor of the cyclotron, the accelerator of charged particles used equipment such as Cockcroft Walton's potential multiplier, Van de Graf stationary power generator, tracer accelerator, etc
 parantu in sabhi upkarnon ke upyog main kuch na kuch praayogic kathinaaiyaan vidyaman thim
 For example, the use of a tracer accelerator had the following two inconveniences; cychlotron kii upyogitaayen itani adhik he ki un sabko yahan uddhrut karnaa sambhav nahin
 Nevertheless the main utilities are being provided here
 ucch urja ke dutron, protron, elfaa kan evam neutron kii prapti ke liye yah ek prabal saadhan he
 These high-energy particles are used for nuclear transposition
 udhaaharan swaroop cychlotron se praapt ucch urja ke dutron berilium torget kii ore phenke jate hai jisase boron nabhikon evam neutronon kaa nirmaan hota he or saath hi urja bhi praapt hoti he
 Can display the entire process as follows: nabhikeey tatwantaran ke adhyayan ke shaikshik mahatv ke atirikt yah radio sodium, radio phosphorus, radio aayran evam anya radioactive tatwon ke vyapaarik nirmaan ke liye upyog main laayaa gaya he
 The attainment of radioactive elements has acquired an important place in research
 har radioactive tatv chikitsa, vigyaan, ejiniyari, technology aadi ke kshetron main nae-nae anusandhanon ko janm de rahaa he
 These research are certainly part of the "peaceful use of nuclear energy"
 cychlotron ucch aavriti ke prayavarti vibhavantar kaa prayog karke aaweshit kan punj ko twarit karata he
 These charged particles are applied inside a vacuum chamber between two hollow "D" shaped sheet metal electrodes called "dies"
 unke bich ek sankeern antaraal ke saath ek dusre ke saamne rakhaa jaataa he, jo kanon ko sthanantarit karne ke liye unke bheetar ek belanaakaar jagah banaate hai
 The particles are left in the center of this space
 yah des ek bade vidyut chumbak ke chhadon ke bich sthit hote hai jo electrode ke samadharaatal ke liye sthitik chumbakeey kshetra bi loop ko lagu karata he
 The magnetic field tilts the path of the particle, because the causal lawrange force is perpendicular to the direction of motion

 shriram mandir ke sankalpak jagadguru ramanandacharya swami shriramnareshacharya ji maharaj ne mandir nirmaan ke uddeshyon par samay-samay par prakaash daalaa he
 According to Acharyashree, since the time immemorial, humanity has the expectation of the Shriram sentiment for its entirety, there is no alternative today or there will be any time, it will have to go out of its communal boundary walls and accept anxious personalities
 sansar ke jo mahaamanishi shriram ko parameshwar ke rup main sweekaar nahin karte ve bhi unhen vishwa itihaas kaa sarvshereshth maanav to maanate hin hai
 Even in this peak period of imagination and material development, none of the castes and religions of the world have characterization like Shri Ram, while everyone is expected
 vartmaan sansar kii akhil samskritiyaan shriram samskruti kii hin jeern-sheern-vikrut or mishrit swaroop hai
 This is the predominant spirit of the culture-oriented greats
 aise shriram kaa mandir kahaan nahin hona chahie, arthath sarvatra hona chahie
 Should be in all the regions, periods and directions of the world
 tabhi maanavtaa kaa purna vikaas hoga
 For this purpose, this magnificent temple is being constructed
 swami ramanareshacharyaji maharaj kehete hai ki inhen bhaavon ko dhyaan main rakhkar srisampradaay tathaa sagun evam nirgun rambhakti parampara ke mul acharyapeeth shrimath, kaashi ne haridwar main adwitiya shrirammandir nirmaan kaa sankalp shriramji kii prerana evam anukampaa se kiya he
 The Paramacharya and Paramaradhya Sri Ram are the only members of the community
 itihaas sakshi he ki srisampradaay ke aacharyo ne rambhakti -parampara kaa mukhyatirth ayodhya ko chhodkar kaashi ko apana mukhyalay banaaya
 This revolution of the Acharyas gave unbeatable intensity to Rambhakti and eradicated the stigma and disharmony of Shaivites and Vaishnavas
 atev haridwar main shriram mandir kaa nirmaan avyavhaarik tathaa amaryadit nahin he
 Haridwar is the gateway to the well-established Badridham in Chargham

 Born on 27 December 1937 in the village of Bhawanipur in Aurangabad district of Bihar, the famous freedom fighter, litterateur and member of Bihar Legislative Council late Kamataprasad Singh, the child's parents took the name of his adorable god Shankar as Prasad, and named it Shankar Dayal
 Which became Shankar Dayal Singh by coincidence with the word caste

 Shankar Dayal Singh was a member of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, but since he was originally a litterateur, he would not like to get into politics and often used to take umbrellas of literature to avoid its scorching sun
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki ve apane lekhon main un sabaki bakhiya udhed kar rakh dete the jo unke shuddh ant:karan ko niti viruddh lagate the
 Like the government's sense of neutrality towards the village revival, he used to keep his voice in the discussions of Parliament, he also wrote articles in various magazines and magazines which were read by the anti-party happy and the ruling-party, which he himself used to be an MP
 He was unhappy

 He often used to give the example of all the veteran political figures before him and told that all those great people were litterateurs first, later politicians or anything; Due to which there was constant balance in their life and they could never cheat the country
 aaj jise dekho vahi raajnneeti ko vyavsaay kii tarah samajhataa he seva kii tarah nahin; yahi kaaran he ki sarvatra ashaanti kaa samrajya he

 When the Indian freedom struggle or the war of our freedom was fought through one language Hindi, no prefecture-language speaker in this country had any hindrance to learn their language first and only then they would unite and support you otherwise

 Since Shankar Dayal Singh was also a Member of Parliament and his standing in Parliamentary Affairs Committees remained equal, he also got the pleasure of traveling to various countries and places with the help of government resources
 parantu unhone vah sukh akele na uthaakar apane saahitiyik mitron ko bhi uplabdh karaayaa tathaa lekhon ke madhyam se apane pathakon ko bhi pahunchaaya

 Despite all this, he was awarded the Anantagopal Shevade Hindi Award for Hindi service in 1993 and the Gadgil National Award in 1995, but he was never completely satisfied mentally
 nissandeh shankar dayaal singh puraskaar yaa sammaan paakar apni bolti band rakhane waalon kii shrenee ke vyakti nahin, apitu or adhik prakharata se mukhar hone waalon kii shrenee ke vyakti the
 This was the reason why the Central Government, as an eminent writer, may not have given any award or honor, for which he was actually an officer; But he received many awards from many institutions, organizations and state governments from all over India
