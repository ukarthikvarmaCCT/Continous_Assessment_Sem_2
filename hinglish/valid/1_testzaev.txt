 It was not decided how many players would play in each side and sometimes hundreds participated in one type of giant rolling mall

 Dodd traveled around the city in a horse-drawn carriage and distributed gifts to the fathers who were left in their homes due to illness

 Euclid, or Euclidis, was a mathematician of ancient Greece
 use "jyamiti kaa janak" kaha jaataa he
 His book named Elements is a successful book in the history of mathematics
 is pustak main kuch gine-chune swayansidhon ke aadhaar par jyamiti ke bahut se siddhanth nishpadit kiye gayi hai
 Such geometry was named after him as Euclide Geometry
 hajaaron varshon baad bhi ganitiya pramayon ko siddh karne kii euclid kii vidhi sampoorn ganit kaa ridh bani hui Euclid also wrote books on cones, spherical geometry and possibly quadratic planes
 euclid greek ganitagya the, jo isa se lagbhag 325 varsh purv hue the
 It is said that he received his early education in Athens from Plato's disciples

 Euclid had set up a school in]
 iske atirikt euclid ke vishay main kuch pataa nahin chalaata
 Some mistakenly considered him Euclid of Megara, who was a contemporary of this, but it was his illusion, which was overcome by a writer in 1572 AD
 euclid kaa sabase bada granth 'elements' he, jo 13 bhaagon main he
 Even before this, many mathematicians wrote geometries, but after all that no one has been able to match the geometry that Euclid wrote, and no book has been written in the world till today without changing in the field of science
 Has held its dominance for 2,000 years and was originally studied till the end of 19th century
 euclid ne nai utpattiyaan di
 The order of the origins also changed, so that all of the old origins became useless
 yah maananaa hi padegaa ki pustak kii abhiklpana uski apni thi
 He gave all the research up to that time in his book
 usne sabhi tathyon ko bade taarkik dhang se aise kram main likhaa ki prayek nayaa prameya uske pehle pramayon ke tathyon par aadhaarit tha
 While doing so, Euclid arrived at facts that did not require proof
 unhone aise tathyon ko swayansiddh kaha
 The number of such axioms is six, or twelve
 antim swayansiddh is prakaar he
 If one line cuts two lines and the sum of the internal angles on one side is less than two right angles
 bahut dinon tak to is swayansiddh ke vishay main kisi ko aalochana karne kaa saahas nahin hua, parantu log isko swayansiddh maanane main aapatti karte rahe
 Even a lot of exploration happened
 19veen shatabdi main hi log is nishkarsh par pahunch paae ki uparyukt swayansiddh satya nahin he, jisase unhone aeuclidia jyamiti kaa avishkaar kiya
 Aj euclid ne anya granth bhi likhe hai, jinamein kuch mili hai or kuch nahin
 Following are the texts that have been found data isamen 94 prameya hai, jo is baat se sambandh rakhte hai ki yadi kisi akruti ke kuch avyay gyaat hon, to anya kaise nikaale jaaen

 Chandrakant Raju and some other scholars think that Euclid is a mythic personality
 unka tark he ki yuclid ko jis 'elemants' aadi kaa rachanaakaar bataaya jaataa he ve pustaken bahut baad kii rachana hai
 The name of Euclid does not appear in the Greek manuscripts, but all the manuscripts refer to the unnamed person as 'the author of the Elements'

 Pakistan's land is the national anthem of Pakistan
 ise urdu main "qaumi taraana" kaha jaataa he
 It was written by Hafeez Jalandhari and composed by Akbar Muhammad
 yah san 1954 main pakistan kaa raashtragan bana or us se pehle jagannatha azaad dwaara likhit "i sarazamin-e-paak" pakistan kaa raashtragan tha
 There is more emphasis on Persian words than ordinary Urdu in Pak land
 14 agast 1947 ko bharat vibhajit hua or purv or pashchim main ek nae desh pakistan ne janm liya
 The dream of Quaid Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah of Pakistan came true
 nayaa desh banane ke saath hi desh ke liye vibhinn chinh or pratik chunane kaa kaam bhi shuru hua
 The country's flag was already prepared, but the national anthem was not made
 azaadi ke samay pakistan ke paas koi raashtra-geet nahi tha
 Therefore whenever the flag was chanted, "pakistan Zindabad, Azadi Pindabad" slogans were raised
 jinnah ko yah manzur nahi tha
 He wanted that the work of creating the national song of Pakistan should be completed soon
 unke salaah kaaron ne unako anekon janemaane urdu shaayaron ke naam sujhaaye jo geet rach sakate the
 But Jinnah's thinking was different
 unhen laga ki duniya ke samaksh pakistan kii dharmanirpeksh chhavi sthapit karne kaa yah acha mauka he
 So he told the great Urdu poet and native Hindu Jagannath Azad of Lahore that "I can give you only five days, you can write a national song for Pakistan"
 jagannatha azaad achambhit bhi the or khush bhi the
 But the radical leaders of Pakistan were very angry that a Hindu would write the national anthem of Pakistan
 lekin jinnah kii marzi ke aage ve bebas the
 Finally, within five days Jagannath Azad composed the national song which Jinnah liked very much
 gane ke bol the - Oh my heart, your love is better than mine, today your happiness is nowhere jinnah ne ise raashtra-geet ke rup me manyata di or unki mrityu tak yahi geet raashtra-geet bana rahaa
 But just 18 months after the acceptance of this song, Jinnah died and with him the recognition of the national song was ended
 jagannatha azaad baad main bharat chale aae
 After Jinnah's death, the Government of Pakistan formed a rashtra-geet Committee
 or jane maane shairo ke paas se geet ke namoonay mangavaaye
 But no song was able to become a national song
 aakhirkaar pakistan sarkaar ne 1950 me ahamed chagala dwaara rachit dhun ko rashtriya dhun ke rup me manyata di
 At the same time, Shah of Iran visited Pakistan and liked the tune
 yah dhun paashchaatya adhik lagati thi, lekin raashtra-geet cameti kaa maananaa tha ki iskaa yah swaroop paashchaatya samaaj me adhik sweekrut hoga
 In 1954, Urdu poet Hafiz Jalandhari composed a song based on this tune
 yah geet raashtra-geet cameti ke sadasyon ko pasand bhi aayaa
 And finally the song written by Hafiz Jalandhari became the national song of Pakistan
