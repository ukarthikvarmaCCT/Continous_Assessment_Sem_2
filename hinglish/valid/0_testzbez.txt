 "pehle maine sochaa tha ki tul kahin behatar he, lekin vahaan mujhe ek netaa kii kami mahasoos hui, jo ian anderson kaa tarika tha
 When i came back from Tull, i came up with a new approach
 unhone mujhe sikhaaya he ki apane ko paanaa he to iske liye kaam kiya jaay
 While doing the show in England in 1969, the band found out that they were being treated as an English group called Another Earth, when they decided to change their name again
 band ke purvaabhyas ke kamare kii sadak ke us paar ek theatre main 1963 kii boris karlof kii horer film blike sabbath dikhaayi ja rahi thi
 Seeing the crowd of people watching the film, Butler thought that "it's weird that people spend so much money watching horror movies"
 After that, Osbourne wrote a song titled Black Sabbath, inspired by the work of Tantra-mantra writer Dennis Whitley, as well as a dream that inspired Butler's specter near his bed
 Looks at musical tritone kaa istemaal karke, jise "da davilj interval" bhi kehete hai, geet kii apshaguni dhwani or nishprabh geet ne band ko andhkarpurn disha main dhakel diya, 1960 ke dashak ke phulon kii bahaar, lok sangeet or hippie samskruti ke prabhutv ke lokapriy sangeet ke thik ulta tha
 Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969, and decided to focus on writing the same type of material in an effort to become the musical equivalent of horror films
 disambar 1969 main blike sabbath ne philips records ke liye hastakshar kiye or apni pehali ekal, "evil vuman" ko philips sahaayak phontana records ke madhyam se janvari 1970 main jari kiya
 Subsequent releases were handled by Phillips' newly formed progressive rock label Vertigo Records
 Although the singles failed to make it to the charts, the band spent two days in the studio at the end of January recording their debut album with producer Roger Bain
 Iommi recalls Recording Live: "we thought 'we have two days to do it and one day of it is for mixing
' ' to hamane live kaam kiya
 Ozzy was singing at the same time, we just put him in a different booth and we walked out
 hamane adhikansh saamagree ko dobaaraa record nahin kiya

 The album ranked 8th in the UK Albums Chart and the album peaked at number 23 on the Billboard 200 after being released by Warner Bros
 Records of the US in May 1970
 haalanki elbum ko vyavsaayik safalataa mili, lekin vyapak rup se aalochakon dwaara isaki nakaaratmak aalochana kii gayi
 Lester Bangs of Rolling Stone criticized the album as saying "the bass and guitar jams sound like a whimper on all other musical perimeters, yet are unable to evoke coherence
" Despite criticism, it was sold in sufficient numbers, giving the band its first mainstream performance
 It was then certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and the UK by the British Phonographic Industry
 US main chart kii apni safalataa ko bhunaane ke liye, blike sabbath ke jari hone ke sirf chaar maheene ke baad hi, band june 1970 main turant studio laut gaya
 The new album was initially named] on a song called "war Pigs", which criticized the Vietnam War
 lekin warner ne vietnam yuddh ke samarthakon ke gusse ke bhay se elbum kaa sheershak badalakar paranoid kar diya
 The album's opening single "paranoid" was written in the studio at the last minute
 jaisaa ki bill ward bataate hai "elbum ke liye hamaare paas paryaapt geet nahin the or tony ne bas guitar bajaanaa shuru kiya or bas itnaa hi
 upar se neeche tak isamen bees, pachchis minute laga
" ekal ko elbum se pehle sitambar 1970 main jari kiya gaya or britain ke chart par chauthe sthaan par ja pahunchaa, blike sabbath ke baaki ne sirf top ten hasil kiya

 The US release was halted until January 1971, with the Black Sabbath album still on the charts at the time of Paranoid's UK release
 march 1971 main elbum ne US main top ten main sthaan paaya or US main chalis lakh pratiyaan biki, radio se iskaa koi prasaaran nahin kiya gaya
 The album was again criticized by rock critics of that era, but modern critics of Allmusic such as Steve Huay said Paranoid is "one of the greatest of all time and a very influential heavy metal album that is heavier than any other record in rock history
" Defines the sound and style of metal "
 In 2003, it was ranked 130 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 500 Greatest Albums
 paranoid kii chart safalataa ke kaaran band ne pehali baar disambar 1970 main america kii yatra kii, jisane elbum ke duusare ekal "aayran main" ke relies ko janm diya

 Ward said, "we were taking a dip in coke, what fun it was
 " "appers, downers, kwaluds, aap jo bhi chahen
 yah manch par praapt ho jaataa he jahaan aap vichaaron ke saath aate hai or unhen bhul jate hai, kyonki aap bas isse baahar ho jate hai

 The album made it to the top ten in both the US and UK and achieved Gold Authenticity in less than two months, and eventually Platinum certification in the 1980s and Double Platinum in the early 21st century
 master of reality main "children of da grev" or "sweet lif" jaise prashansakon ke pasandida geeton sahit blike sabbath kaa pehla dhvanik geet bhi shaamil he
 Critical reaction to the era was unfavorable again, with Rolling Stone's Lester Bangs dismissing Master of Reality by calling it an "inexperienced, straightforward, repetitive, nonsensical song", though the same magazine later compiled his 500 Greatest Albums, compiled in 2003
 Placed it at number 298 on the all-time list
 1972 main master of reality kii duniya kii saiyr ke baad, blike sabbath ne teen saal main pehali baar vishram liya
 As Bill Ward states: "the band was beginning to become very jaded and tired
 ham bina ruke chalate rahe, saal-dar-saal lagaataar daura or ricarding karte rahe the
 i think the Master of Reality in the first three albums was like the end of an era and we decided to take our time before the next album arrived
 june 1972 main, record plant main apane agle elbum par kaam shuru karne ke liye los angeles main band phir se ikattha hua
 The recording process became problematic, causing many problems as a result of substance abuse issues
 Bill Ward was almost expelled from the band at the time of the fight over the recording of "kourtukopia" song "sitting in the Middle of the Room"
 "mujhe geet se nafrat he, uske kuch pattern aise hai jo ki bas


bhayanak hai, ward ne kaha
 "maine antat is par kaabo paa liya tha, lekin sabaki pratikriya jo mujhe mili wo badi thandi thi
 It was like, 'okay, you go home now, at the moment you are of no use
' i felt like i would blow it up, i was about to be fired
 " aarambh main ek geet ke sheershak par elbum kaa naam rakhaa gaya tha "snoblind", jo cocaine seven ke bare main tha
 The record company changed the name to Black Sabbath Volume 4 at the last minute, to which Ward says "there is no section called 1, 2, or 3, so the name is really very stupid"
 blike sabbath wolum 4 sitambar 1972 ko jari kiya gaya tha or us yug ke aalochakon dwaara elbum ko phir se khaarij kar die jane ke baavjood isane ek maheene se bhi kam samay main gold states hasil kiya, or yah band kaa lagaataar chauthaa elbum bana jisaki das lakh pratiyaan US main biki

 The song "tomorrow's Dream" was released as the band's first single after Paranoid, but failed to chart

 yug ke sangeet ke nae avishkaar karanevaale band ko yah dekhakar tajjub hua ki isse pehle unhone record plant ke jis kamare kaa istemaal kiya tha vahaan ek "vishaal synthesizer" rakhaa hua he
 The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but were unable to complete any songs due to drug issues and fatigue
 Thoughts were not coming out the way they were in Volume 4 and we are really disappointed by this "iommi said
" Everyone sat there waiting for me to do something
 i could not think of anything
 or yadi maine iskaa hal nahin nikaala, to koi bhi kuch nahin kar paaegaa
" a month later, with no results in Los Angeles, the band returned to England, where they rented Clearwell Castle in The Forest of Dean
 "hamane tahkhaane main abhyaas shuru kiya or yah sachmuch lomaharshak tha, lekin vahaan ek maahaul tha, isse jaadu jaisaa hua or vichaar phir se baahar aane shuru ho gaye
 While working in the basement, Iommi gets stuck on the main piece of "sabbath Bloody Sabbath", which sets the tone for the new material

 In diophantic problems the number of equations is less than the number of variables
 in samikarnon main charon ke gunank purnank hote hai or charon kaa aisa purnank maan praapt karnaa hota he jo in samikarnon ko santusht karen
 Therefore, all those equations are named diophantic equations in which the coefficients of the variables are integers
 diophanteey samasyaon ke ganitiya adhyayan ko aajkal diophanteey vishleshan kehete hai
 Every diophantic equation has been used in history as an extinguisher, but the general theory of diophantic equations is considered a major mathematical achievement of the twentieth century

 In the general theory of relativity in physics, the event horizon is a boundary in time beyond which the events that occur beyond it cannot have any effect on the universe outside its boundary, nor will any spectator or listener sitting outside its boundary ever see it It can also be known what is happening beyond this horizon

 Those who look from a distance feel that the speed of that object falling towards the black hole is slowing down and the redness in its image is increasing

 But that object does not feel any such effect - it feels that it quickly falls towards the black hole and crosses the event horizon

 These include: britain main bank aksar purvayojit seemaa ke saath ek buniyadi overdraft suvidha pradaan karte hai
 However, whether the facility provided is interest free or not varies depending on the average monthly balance or overdraft loan rate of the bank, as per the account product in different banks

 On this process, a BBC program Whistleblower noted that the actual amount of unauthorized overdrafts from a bank was less than two pounds

 However, some banks provide a 'buffer zone', in which customers are not charged if they cross their limit by less than a certain amount
 Other banks charge an overdraft fee regardless of the amount of the level of the overdraft, which some consider to be unfair

 They also provide a 'grace period' in which you can deposit funds by 3:30 pm before any documents are returned or bank charges are levied

 However, some banks, such as Halifax, have a "no charge on fees" policy under which an account is not charged extra if it is overdrawn due to completely unpaid fees

 overdraft sangrakshan kaa yah rup un upabhoktaaon ke liye uplabdh he jo bainkon dwaara aise khaaton ke liye sthapit rinpaatrata ke mandandon ko puraa karte hai
 Once the credit line is established, the available credit may appear as the customer's remaining available balance
 yah "overdraft sthanantaran sangrakshan" ke rup main bhi sanderbhit he, ek chaalu khaataa kisi anya khate se joda ja saktaa he, jaise ek bachat khate se, credit card se, yaa credit line se
 ek baar sambandh sthapit ho jane ke baad, jab ek mad chaalu khate main prastut kiya jaataa he or overdraft ho jaataa he, to overdraft ko cover karne ke liye sambhddha khate se kosh chaalu khate main sthanantarit ho jaataa he
 a nominal fee is charged for each overdraft transfer and if the associated account is a credit card or credit line, the customer is required to pay interest under the terms of that account
 sambhddha khate or overdraft credit line ke bich mukhya antar yah he ki overdraft credit line aamtaur par keval overdraft sangrakshan ke liye hi prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Separate accounts associated with overdraft protection are independent accounts in their own right
 kuch bainkon dwaara ek or adhik taaja utpaada kii peshkash kii ja rahi he jise "anadaran suraksha" kehete hai
 Small banks are offering schemes administered by third party companies which will help banks to earn additional fee income
 Big banks do not have the tendency to introduce dishonor security plans, but instead process overdrafts according to the terms and conditions of their accounts
 donon main se kisi bhi ek maamle main bank apane vivekaanusaar adhi-aaharith mad ko cover karne kaa nirnay kar sakate hai or overdraft shulk laga sakate hai jisaki raashi ko prakat bhi kiya ja saktaa he or nahin bhi
 paaramparik tadarth kawarej ke vipareet, adhi-aaharith madon kaa bhugtan karne yaa na karne kaa yah nirnay swachaalit he or graahak ke ausat shesh, khate ke overdraft itihaas, bank main graahak ke khaaton kii sankhya or un khaaton ke khulne se ab tak kii avadhi, jaise vishaynishth mandandon par aadhaarit he
 However, even when the automatic criteria are met, banks do not promise payment of overdraft
 anadaran suraksha yojana kii satahi rup se overdraft credit line or overdraft kii tadarth kawarej ke saath kuch samanthaayen hai, lekin karne ke liye alag niyamon ke tahat kaam karti he
 Like an overdraft credit line, the balance of the dishonor protection scheme can also be viewed along with the available balance of the customer, even then the bank reserves the right to refuse payment of an overdrawn item, which is the traditional ad hoc coverage
 Is similar to bank aamtaur par prayek bhukt overdraft ke liye ekamusth shulk lete hai
 a bank may also charge a recurring daily fee for each day during which there is a negative balance in the account
 aalochakon kaa tark he ki kyonki graahak ko dhan agrim ke rup main diya jaataa he or uske punarbhugtan kii ummid bhi hoti he, atah anadaran suraksha ek prakaar kaa rin hi he
 Because banks are not obligated under any contract to cover overdrafts, "dishonor protection" is not regulated by the Truth in Lending Act, which prohibits misleading advertisements and is required to disclose the terms of the loan
 aitihaasik rup se, anadaran suraksha ko graahak kii anumati yaa jaankaree ke bina uske khate main joda ja saktaa he
 In May 2005, Regulation DD of Truth in Savings Act was amended that banks providing "dishonor protection" scheme would have to make certain disclosures to their customers
 These amendments include the need to disclose transactions triggering dishonor protection, fees related to dishonor protection, separate details indicating the number of charges levied and restrictions on marketing of dishonor protection schemes to prevent misleading advertisements
 to set
 Large banks, which process overdrafts on their own terms and conditions, are already making these disclosures
 america bainkon dwaara 2009 main overdraft shulk se $38
5 billian ekatra karne kaa anumaan he jo 2000 kii main lagbhag doguna he
 The area of dispute regarding overdraft fees is the order in which a bank transfers to a customer's transaction account
 yah vivaadaaspad he, kyonki sabase bade se sabase chote sansaadhan se graahak ke khate main overdraft hone kii ghatnaayen adhiktam hongi
 yah sthiti us samay utpann hoti he jab khatadharak chote-chote kai debit banaata he jinke liye kharid ke samay khate main paryaapt kosh uplabdh he
 Later, the account holder makes a large debit which over-draws the account
 If all items for payment from the account are presented on the same day and the bank processes the largest transaction first, then multiple overdrafts can occur as a result
 bade america bainkon main "sabase badi jaanch pehle" niti aam he
 Banks argue that this is done in order to prevent the undiscounted return of important transactions of a customer, even though some such transactions are guaranteed
 yah sahi ho saktaa tha, yadi bank ne kabhi vastav main kisi kam shulk ke liye inkaar kiya hota, bajaay unhen jane dekar jisase graahak par ek shulk lage
 upabhoktaaon ne is pratha ko rokane ke liye muqadama karne kaa prayaas kiya, unka tark tha ki bank adhik overdraft shulk ekatra karne ke liye "sabase badi jaanch pehle" kaa prayog karke lenden ke kram main herapheri karte hai taaki kritrim rup se adhik overdraft utpann hon
 sanyukt rajya america main adhiktar bank ek sangheey agency mudra niyantrak kaa karyaalay se viniyamit hote hai jisane is prakriya ko aupchaarik rup se manjuuri de di he, haalanki is prakriya ko haal hi main anek nijee rajkeey bhraamak kanoonon ke antargat chunauti di gai he
 Bank deposit agreements generally provide that the bank can clear the transaction in any order at its discretion

 Template: NSF hinduon ke vaishnav sampradaay main gautam buddha ko bhagwaan vishnu kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 The 9th incarnation of Buddha is presently considered in Dashavatar as described in Hinduism
 bhavishya main antim kalki avatar hoga
 Buddha is mentioned in all the major Puranas and all important Hindu texts
 kintu sabhi ek hi 'buddha' ke bare main hon, aisa sambhavtah nahin he
 But most of these texts clearly speak of 'buddha', the originator of Buddhism
 in granthon main mukhyatah buddha kii do bhoomikaaon kaa varnan he- dharm kii punah sthapana ke liye naastik mat kaa prachaar tathaa pashu-bali kii ninda
 Below is a reference to mention of Buddha in some of the Puranas- harivansh parv Vishnu Purana bhagwat puraana Garuda Purana agnipurana Narada Purana lingapurana Padma Purana bahraapan yaa ashravyata purna yaa aanshik rup se dhvaniyon ko sunne kii shakti kaa hraas hone kii sthiti ko kehete hai
 It is a common disease
 is rog main na sirf sunne kii shakti kam ho jaati he balki vyakti kii saamaajik va maansik pareshaaniyaan bhi bad jaati hai
 When a person speaks, he creates a vibration in the air by sound waves
 yah kampan kaan ke parde evam sunne se sambandhit teen haddiyon-melius, inkas evam stepis ke dwaara aantarik kaan main pahunchataa he or sunne kii nas dwaara aantarik kaan se mastishk main sampreshit hota he
 Due to this, there is a feeling of sound
 yadi kisi kaaran se dhwani kii in tarangon main avrodh paidaa ho jaae, to bahraapan ho jayega
 Other deafness can have many causes
 inamen se nimna pramukh hai:- Signs of deafness are targeted from the age of one child
 yadi avrodh kaan ke parde yaa sunne kii haddiyon tak simit rahata he to ise concective defnes kehete hai
 Conjunctive dysfunctions can result in earwax or fungus, ear runoff, which causes the ear curtain to rupture and pierce, otoscrosis in which the very microscopic bone stapes of the ear become even more subtle, causing tremor internal Can not reach the ear, can reach
 is tarah kaa bahraapan saamanyatya yuvaaon main kaan bahe bagaiyr bhi ho saktaa he
 In addition, the ear can be ruptured by loud slapping, bruising, or loud sound banging
 is sthiti main kaan se khun aa saktaa he
 The ear becomes numb or there is a sound of noise in it
 sir baari ho jaataa he yaa chakkar bhi aa saktaa he
 If the obstruction is in the inner part of the ear or in a vein related to hearing, it is called sensory neural deafness
 iske saamaanya lakshan main kaan se sany-sany kii aawaaj athwa tarah-tarah kii awaajen aana or kaan kaa baari hona, kaan main dard hona, jo mobile phone ke zyada istemaal se bad saktaa he, chakkar aana, vyaktitv se sambandhit maansik pareshaaniyaan aadi hote hai
 Sensory neural deafness can result in congenital deafness, which is hereditary or due to a lack of oxygen in the blood when the baby is crying late or is not fully developed in the ear
 inke alaava dhwani pradooshan jaise tej aawaaj ke jenerator, pressure horn, vaahanon dwaara pradooshan se bhi bahraapan ho saktaa he
 And due to old age, ear dysfunction, sometimes deafness comes in the ear immediately
 is sthiti main sheeghra hi naak, kaan, galaa visheshgy se sampark karnaa chahie
 The precautions to be taken in this case are as follows: bharat kaa yojana ayog, bharat sarkaar kii ek sanstha thi jiskaa pramukh kaary panchavarshiya yojanayen bananaa tha
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his first Independence Day speech in 2014 that he intended to dissolve the Planning Commission
 2014 main is sanstha kaa naam badalakar niti ayog kiya gaya
 There is no constitutional provision with respect to the Planning Commission in India

 nijee udyogpatiyon or arthshaastriyon ne 1944 main kam se kam teen vikaas yojanayen banaain
 After independence, India adopted a formal model of planning and under it the Planning Commission, which reported directly to the Prime Minister of India, was constituted on 15 March 1950 under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru

 The planning process was interrupted due to two years of continuous drought, devaluation of currency, general rise in prices and erosion of resources and the fourth five-year plan was launched in 1969, after three annual plans between 1966 and 1969

 After some time, Rama departed from Chitrakoot and reached the ashram of Atri Rishi
 atri ne ram kii stuti kii or unki patni anusuya ne sita ko pativrat dharm ke marm samajhaaye
 From there, Rama then proceeded further and met Sharbhang Muni
 sharbhang muni keval ram ke darshan kii kaamana se vahaan nivas kar rahe the atah ram ke darshanon kii apni abhilaashaa purna ho jane se yogagni se apane sharir ko jala daalaa or brahmalok ko gaman kiya
 And on proceeding, Rama was seen piling up bones from place to place, about whom the monks told Rama that the demons have eaten many sages and those are the bones of those sages
 is par ram ne pratigya kii ki ve samast rakshason kaa vadh karke prithvi ko rakshas viheen kar denge
 Rama proceeded further and met the sages like Sutixhan, Agastya etc
 in the path and entered Dandaka forest where he met Jatayu
 ram ne panchvati ko apana nivas sthaan banaaya
 In Panchavati, Ravana's sister Shurpanakha came and pleaded with Rama
 ram ne yah kah kar ki ve apni patni ke saath hai or unka chota bhai akelaa he use lakshmana ke paas bhej diya
 Laxman, rejecting his love, knowing the sister of the enemy, cut his nose and ears
 shurpanakha ne khar-dooshan se sahaayta kii maang kii or vah apni sena ke saath ladane ke liye aa gaya
 In the battle, Rama killed Khar-foul and his army
 shurpanakha ne jaakar apane bhai ravan se shikaayat kii
 Ravana sent Marich as a goldmine to take revenge, whose bark was demanded by Sita to Rama
 lakshmana ko sita ke raksha kii ajna de kar ram swarnamrig rupi marich ko maarane ke liye uske peeche chale gayi
 Marich was killed at the hands of the dying, but while dying, Marich made a voice of Rama and chanted 'ha Lakshman', which Sita apprehensively sent Lakshman to Rama
 lakshmana ke jane ke baad akeli sita kaa ravan ne chhalpurvak haran kar liya or apane saath lanka le gaya
 On the way, Jatayu fought with Ravana to save Sita and Ravana cut his wings and made him half dead
 sita ko na paa kar ram atyant dukhi huye or vilaap karne lage
 On meeting Jatayu on the way, he told Rama about his plight by Ravana and to take Sita to the south
 ye sab bataane ke baad jataayu ne apane praan tyaag diye or ram uskaa antim sanskaar karke sita kii khoj main saghan van ke bheetar aage bade
 On the way Rama slaughtered the Gandharva kabhanda, who became a demon due to the curse of Durvasa, and reached the ashram of Shabari where he ate the false beers given by him under his devotion
 Thus Rama proceeded inside the dense forest in search of Sita

 In the right part of Suryamurthi, there is the octagon Ganesha and Shivling in the left part and Sri Suryayantra in front
 The artwork and script engraved on the doorway at the entrance to the sanctum sanctorum is also unmatched in itself
 But unfortunately all the idols have been damaged by the Mughals
 sthapana:- According to the Puranas, in the Dwapar Yuga, Sambativa, son of Jambavati, the patrani of Sri Krishna, was beautiful, by whom Maharishi Durvasha who came to meet Shri Krishna was despised and the angry Maharishi Durvasha cursed Samb to be cured of leprosy
 Now the entire Yaduvanshi Families got upset
 With the help of Narada, he asked Samb to meditate on the sun and then samb ne mithravan main chandrabhaga nadi ke kinare surya kaa kathor taap kiya or jiske falswaroop bhagavan surya prasann hokar unhen rogamukt kar die| rogamukt karne ke saath hi bhagavan bhaskar ne samb ko barhon raashi main suryamurti kii sthapana kaa aadesh bhi diya | isi kram main pratham mesh raashi ke surya kii sthapana hetu tatkaaleen jyotishiyon kii gananaa ke dwaara shri shivaji kii tapasthali isi kandaha gaanv kaa chayan hua or dwapar yug main shrikrishna putr samb ke dwaara kandaha main pratham raashi mesh ke surya kii sthapana hui or rishi muniyon dwaara ugantar se inaki puja hoti aa rahi he | In this sequence, the Maharaja bathed and consumed the rich medicinal properties of the sun-well located in the courtyard of Suryamandir, which made the Maharaja fully healthy and after receiving the worthy two sons Narasimhadeva and Hari Singhdev, was very delighted and the renovated and sculpted temple
 Was restored and named Bhavaditya Surya after adding his name to Lord Aditya and since then In Kandha name Ry God began to sun worship | Kandaha village is 12 km west of Saharsa headquarters, three km north of Satwar Chowk, connected by a paved road where thousands of devotees visit and worship Lord Bhaskar and get the desired fruit
 According to Mahabharata and Surya Purana, this Sun Temple was constructed in the 'dwapara Yuga'
 puranic manyata ke anusaar bhagwaan krishna ke putr 'shamb' kisi twachaa rog se peedit the jo maatr yahan ke surya coop ke jal se thik ho sakati thi
 This holy sun well is still located near the temple
 is ke pavitra jal se abhi bhi twachaa rogon ke thik hone kii baat bataai jaati he
 This Sun Temple is also considered amazing due to the idol of Sun God
 mandir ke garbh grih main surya dev vishaal pratimaa he, jise is ilaake main ' baba bhavaditya' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The statue depicts 'sangya' and 'kalh', both wives of the Sun God
 saath hi 7 ghode or 14 lagaam ke rath ko bhi darshaya gaya he
 a great feature of this statue is that it is made of very soft black stone
 yah visheshta to konark evam dev ke surya mandiron main bhi dekhne ko nahin milti
 But the most amazing and mysterious is the script engraved on the doorpost of the temple which has not yet been read
 parantu durbhaagya se is pratimaa ko bhi aurangzeb kaal main anya anek hindu mandiron kii tarah hi kshatigrast kar diya gaya
 For this reason, the left hand, nose and thread of the statue are not properly detected
 is pratimaa ke anya anek bhaagon ko bhi aurangzeb kaal main hi todakar nikat ke surya coop main phenk diya gaya tha, jo 1985 main surya coop kii khudaai ke baad mili hai
 After 1985, this temple came under the Archaeological Survey of India Department
 puraatatv vibhaag ne mandir kii dekh rekh ke liye ek karmchaaree ko niyukt kar rakhaa he
 But the government has neglected the restoration and development of this temple
 vah to yahan ke kuch graminon kii jaagrukta evam sahyog ke kaaran mandir apane vartmaan swarup main maujuud he
 The cooperation of many villagers including Nunu Jha and Jayaprakash Verma has been commendable
 is mandir ko bihar sarkaar ke taraf se pratham sahyog tab mila jab ashok kumaar singh paryaton mantri bane
 He gave a grant of Rs 3 xxrep 5 0 in 2003 for the development of this temple
 parantu yah rakam mandir ke vikaas ke liye prayaapt nahin thi
 Nevertheless the temple complex was repaired with this amount
 saath hi mukhya dwaar kaa nirmaan ho sakaa
 But there is still much to be done for this temple and this backward village, so that this amazing temple can be counted as the main tourist destination of Bihar

 apane purvavarti film kii tarah, iskaa nirdesan richard linclator dwaara kiya gaya
 However, now Linkletter also credits the screenplay to the two actors of the film, Ethan Hawke and Julie Dalpy
 linclator bifor sunrise ke mul screen lekhak keem krigen ko bhi kahani ke liye shrey dete hai
 The film picks up the story from Before Sunrise where an American youth meets a French woman on a train and they spend an entire night in Vienna
 bifor sunset main nau saal baad unke raste aapas main takaraate hai
 This happens at the right time as they spend an afternoon together in Paris
 sarvshereshth roopantarit screenple ke liye patakatha kaa academy award ekatra karne ke saath hi yah film vyapaarik or aalochanatmak donon roopon main safal thi
 Nine years have passed since the incident of Before Sunrise, when Jessie and Celine met in Vienna
 is antaraal main celin ke saath bitaye samay se prerit hokar jesi ne ek upanyaas dis time likh diya he or pustak america kii bestceller ho chuki he
 Jessie undertakes book tours to boost sales in Europe
 daure kaa antim padaav paris he or jaisi shakespeare evam company naamak pustak kii dukaan par paath kar rahaa he
 As Jessie talks with the audience, she and Celine are shown in Vienna in a flash back; Despite nine years passed, the memories of the night together remain in his mind
 jesi kaa saakshaatkaar lete hue kitaab kii dukaan main teen patrkaar maujuud hai, ek romani khyal kaa he jo yah vishwaas karata he ki kitaab ke mukhya paatr phir se milenge, ek irshyaalu he jo yah vishwaas karata he ki ve nahin milenge or teesraa jo yah chaahate hue ki ve dubaara milenge, andeh main he ki kya ve aisa kar sakenge
 darshakon se baat karte hue uski ankhen khidki kii ore chali jaati hai or vah mushkil se vishwaas kar saktaa he: celin use dekhakar muskaraa rahi he
 At the end of the presentation, the bookstore manager reminds him that he has to catch an airplane and that he should leave for the airport in about an hour and that Jesse and Celine reunite as they did at Before Sunrise
 Hands are forced
 pehle film kii tarah hi paatro ko saath ke thode samay kaa hi sabase acha upyog karne ke liye baadhya kiya jaataa he, unke baatcheet ko aasaan banaate hue taaki ve adhik kareeb ho saken, praaia:kaam, raajnneeti or anya ke theme ke saath, junun ko badhaate hue, ek dusre ke bich ke unke pyaar ko pakadte hue, thik usee tarah ki unke saath hone kaa samay vyateet ho rahaa he
 At the beginning of their conversation, they raise the topic of why they did not meet even by promising to meet six months after their first meeting
 It seems that Jessie had returned to Vienna as promised, but Celine had not returned, as her grandmother died before the date they met
 kyonki jesi or celin ne ek-duusare ke pate nahin liye the, ek-duusare ko sampark karne kaa koi rasta nahin tha, falswaroop unka sampark tut gaya
 While talking, the two refer to the events that took place after their first meeting
 donon ab apane tees kii ke purvarddh main hai
 Jessie is now married and has a son
 celin paryaavaran kii pakshasamarthak ban gayi he, is samay america main rahati he or uskaa ek purush mitra he, jo photo patrkaar he
 During their talk it becomes clear that both are dissatisfied with the changing expanse of their lives
 jesi bataata he ki keval apane bete ke pyaar kii vajah se hi vah apni patni ke saath rahata he
 Celine says that she does not meet her boyfriend very much because he is often at work
 paris main ghumte hue cafe, bageeche, batu mouch or paris main thaharne ke dauraan jaisi dwaara lee gai bhaade kii car ke saath hi vibhinn jagahon par unki baat hoti he
 Their old feelings for each other are slowly reawakening, with the stress and regret of missing the first visit, as they feel that nothing else in their lives has settled with the night they spent in Vienna
 Pie Jessie eventually admits that she has written this book one day, hoping to meet Celine
 vah jawaab detii he ki yah pustak uske dukhad smritiyon ko dubaara waapas le kar ai he
 At one point, in a tense moment in the mercenary car, when Jessie is accepting of his loveless and dysfunctional marriage, Celine extends her hand to touch Jessie but pulls back, as she Turns towards him
 samaapan drishy main, celin or jesi celin ke apartment main pahunchate he
 Jessie knew that Celine plays the guitar and encouraged her to play the Waltz song for herself
 waltz geet ke madhyam se unke kshanik milan kii baat ujagar hoti he
 Jesse then plays a Nina Simone CD on the stereo system
 celin "just in time" geet par apane aap naachne lagati he or jesi dekhtaa rahata he
 As Celine mimics Simon, muttering Jessie, "baby 


 you're gonna miss your ship
" As the camera slowly rolls down, Jessie smiles in nervousness and restlessness with her wedding ring and responds in an ambiguous manner, "I know," leaving it to the audience to guess whether he stays or goes
 It goes, just like the three journalists who interviewed Jessie at the beginning of the film
 lagbhag yues $2 million ke saath film ko 15 dinon main filmaaya gaya tha
 Hawk commented on the reason for making the film: is film ko tranking shot ke liye sthir camera or 11 minute main sthir camera jitna lanbaa tech letaa he, uskaa upyog karne ke kaaran is film ko darj kiya gaya
 It is also notable that the film takes place in real time, that is, the time spent in the story is also the run time of the film
 iske alaava, agali kadi bifor sunrise ke nau varsh baad relies kii gai, pehali film kii ghatana se samay kii vahi maatra kathanak main bhi vyateet ho chuki he
 Hawk suggested the possibility of further films in this series
 unhone kaha ki yah bahut hi badhiya hoga ki unke sambandhon ke aage kaa silsilaa viksit kiya jaae
 yah film hoque kaa uma therman se talaak hone ke parinaam swaroop prakat hui or kuch tippaneekar hoque ke apane jivan ke saath film ke jesi ke charitra kii tulana karte hai
 Additional comments noted that both Hawke and Depley incorporated elements of their lives into the screenplay, such as the fact that Delpy had lived in New York City for many years
 delpi ne is film main do fichard geet bhi likhe
 ek tihaai main film kii dhwani or cloging credit shaamil hai
 Before Sunset premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 2004 and received a limited release on July 2, 2004, in the United States
 apane udghaatan saptahanth main, film ne sanyukt rajya america ke 20 theatron main $219,425 kamaaye, jiskaa prati theatre ausat $10,971 tha
 While running in theaters, the film grossed $ 5
8 lakh in the United States and about $ 160 million worldwide

 is film ko ek 2008 ampire pole ke dwaara hameshaa se mahaan rahi 110veen film ke rup main sthapit kiya gaya
 Comparing it with the original film, film critic Roger Ebert wrote, "before Sunrise was a remarkable celebration of good dialogue
 lekin bifor sunset behatar he, shaayad isliye ki charitra puraane or budhimaan hai, shaayad isliye kyonki unke paas khone ke liye zyada he or shaayad isliye kyonki hoque or delpi ne swayan hi samvaad likhe hai
 Manohla Durgis of the Los Angeles Times praised it as a "more serious and genuine work of art than the first" and praised director Linkletter for making a film that "assures the best of American cinema
" " Reviewing the acting, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone observes, "hawk and Delpy receive art and criticism closely in spoken and unspoken words
 abhinayta damakate hai
 "philip Hawk of The Observer wrote," Both Hawke and Delpy have excelled and have real depth in their performances
 is baar bhi ve richard linclator kii film main ek kaaryaatmak rachana ke rup main prakat hone se zyada kaam kar rahe hai
 They are now also taking credit for writing with them and putting more of their experiences of the last decade into the character that they have acquired or have received from them

 The new poem was written after the Indian independence, in which new values and new crafts-legislation were explored, along with the expression of new sentiments beyond traditional poetry
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki prayogwaad ke baad hindi kavita kii jo naveen dhara viksit hui, vah nai kavita he
 The name New Poetry became an impetus for those poems written after independence, which are distinctive even in the development of progressivism and experimentalism in both their object and image
 nayi kavita-andolan kaa aarambh elahabaad kii saahitiyik sanstha parimal ke kavi lekhakon- jagadish gupt, ramswarup chaturvedi or vijayadevanrayan saahi ke sampadan main 1954 main prakashit "nayi kavita" patrika se mana jaataa he
 Earlier, the role of the second collection of poetry collection published in the editing of Agyeya and the statements of some poets included in it the term 'new poem' for their poets was accepted
 nayi kavita ke liye jagat-jivan se sambandhit koi bhi sthiti, sambandh, bhav yaa vichaar kathy ke rup main tyajya nahin he
 The new poem has expressed the conditions, situations, relationships, feelings, thoughts and actions of today's human life from birth to death
 nae kavi ne kisi bhi kathy ko tyajya nahin samajha he
 There is a request for self-realization in the new poem about the story
 nayaa kavi apane kathy ko usee rup main prastut karnaa chahta he, jis rup main use vah anubhoot karata he
 The new poem is a poem of liberation
 isse pehle ke kavi bhi praayah kisi na kisi vaad kaa sahaara avashya lete the
 And if the poet does not care about the debate, but the critic used to search for the debate before poetry in his creation - the poetry used to examine poetry
 kintu nayi kavita kii sthiti bhinn he
 The new poet is not ready to fall into the fanaticism of any doctrine, schism, sect or urge of vision
 sankshep main, nayi kavita koi vaad nahin he, jo apane kathy or drushti main simit ho
 The comprehensiveness of the story and the liberation of the creation are the greatest features of the new poem
 nai kavita parampara ko nahin maanati
 Humans have individual differences, there are good as well as evils
 nai kavita ke kavi ko manushya in sabhi roopon main pyaara he
 His purpose is to depict the totality of man
 nai kavita jivan ke prati aasthaa kii rakhti he
 Today's momentary and miniaturist vision is an acceptable view of life-values
 nai kavita main jivan kaa purna sweekaar karke use bhogane kii laalasaa he
 To accept each and every feeling of life, agony, happiness, truth, and to accept life intensively is to accept forgiveness as truth
 nai kavita ne jivan ko na to ekangi rup main dekha na keval mahat rup main, usne jivan ko jivan ke rup main dekha
 It did not set any limit
 jaise- dukh sabko maanjata he or, chaahe swayan sabko mukti dena na jane, kintu-jisko maanjata he, unhen yah sikh detaa he ki, sabko mukt rakhen
 There are two main elements in the new poem - truth of cognition and intelligent realist vision
 vah anubhuti kshan kii ho yaa ek samooche kaal kii, kisi saamaanya vyakti kii ho yaa vishisht purush kii, aashaa kii ho yaa niraashaa kii, apni sachai main kavita ke liye or jivan ke liye bhi amuly he
 Rationalism in the new poem is also in the form of new realistic vision and as an identity of new life-consciousness
 yahi kaaran he ki tatasth prayogshiltaa nai kavita ke kathy or style-donon kii visheshta he
 The new poet has a neutral attitude towards his narrative, as he tries to remain free from promises
 is visheshta ke kaaran nai kavita main kathyon kii koi ek paridhi nahin he
 In this, new layers of story come out of it
 kabhi-kabhi vah apane hi kathanon kaa khandan bhi kar detaa he- eemaandaaree ke kaaran
 The new poet suffers by drowning, but does not drown while undergoing
 nai kavita jivan ke ek-ek kshan ko satya maanati he or us satya ko puri hardikta or puri chetana se bhogane kaa samarthan karti he
 The truth of cognition, the more it is able to take, the more it is true for its poetry
 nai kavita anubhutipurna gahare kshanon, prasangon, vyapaar yaa kisi bhi satya ko uski aantarik maarmikata ke saath pakad lenaa chaahati he
 In this way, the simple business-related business or context finds new meaning in the new poem
 nai kavita main kshanon kii anubhutiyon ko lekar bahut-si marmasparshi kavitaayen likhi gai hai
 Which are small in size but very intense in effect
 nai kavita parampara ko nahin maanati
 These poets have opposed traditionalist inertia
 pragatisheel kaviyon ne parampara kii jadta kaa virodh isliye kiya he ki vah logon ko shoshan kaa shikaar banaati he or duniya ke mazdooron tathaa daliton ko ek jhande ke neeche ekatra hone main baadha daalati he
 The new poet opposes him because he is frustrated with human conscience
 nai kavita saamaajik yatharth tathaa usamen vyakti kii bhoomika ko parakhane kaa prayaas karti he
 Because of this, the new poem has a deep connection with social reality
 parantu nai kavita kii yathartwaadee drushti kaalpanik yaa adarshavaadi maanavvaad se santrusht na hokar jivan kaa mulya, uskaa saundarya, uskaa prakaash jivan main hi khojati he
 The new poem, Dwivedi, does not offer its ready-made value propositions like poetry, cinematography or progressivism, rather it wants to find it within the true agony of life
 isliye nai kavita main vyangy ke rup main kahin puraane mulyon kii asweekruti he, to kahin dard kii sachai ke bheetar se ugte hue nae mulyon kii sambhaavna ke prati aasthaa
 The new poem has challenged all kinds of values of religion, philosophy, policy, ethics
 nai kavita kaa swar apane parivesh kii jivananubhuti se phuta he
 The new poem has poets writing about both urban life and rural-life environments
 agyeya ne donon par likhaa he
 While Balakrishna Rao, Shamsher Bahadur Singh, Girijakumar Mathur, Kunvarnarayan Singh, Dharamvir Bharti, Prabhakar Machve, Vijaydevanarayan Sahi, Raghuveer Sahai, etc
 have the sensations and feelings of the poet in the urban environment, on the other hand Bhavniprasad Mishra, Kedarnath Singh, Shambhunath Singh, Thakur Prasad Singh, Thakur Prasad Singh Nagarjuna, Kedarnath Agarwal etc
 are poets who are basically associated with the sensations and sensations of the village
 inke atirikt usamen jahaan ghutan, vyarthta, ub, paraajay, hin-bhav, aakrosh hai, vahiin atmpeedan parak bhavanaayen bhi hai
 The ambience of the new poem is its life here
 kintu us par akshep he ki usamen atirikt anasthaa, niraashaa, vyaktivaadee kuntha or marandharmita he jo pashchim kii nakal se paidaa hui he
 In the new poem, suffering and despair are not considered as a side of life at some places, but it is taken as the whole life-truth
 vahaan pidaa jivan kii sarjanaatmak shakti na banakar use gatiheen karanevaali baadha batch gai he
 Public prosperity is a special feature of the new poem
 vah sahaj lok-jivan ke kareeb pahunchne kaa praytn kar rahi he
 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain, while reviewing the poems of Bhavani Prasad Mishra, states that "the biggest attack on the new Hindi poem is that it has extra dislocation, despair, hopelessness, frustration, frustration and deathliness
" usko padhane ke baad jeene kii lalak samaapt ho jaati he, vyakti hatotsahit ho jaataa he, man nirashaavadi or maranasann ho jaataa he
 That the new poem has accepted suffering, pain, grief and despair as the truth of life
 nai kavita bharat kii jameen se prerana praapt nahin karti
 On the contrary it is born out of imitation of the West
 bhavani prasad mishra kii kavitaayen in saare aaropon ko dhwast kar detii hai
 Mishra is a Gandhian
 gandhi kii desh-bhakthi manzil nahin he
 Gandhi's patriotism is a stop in his life journey to love and serve only the living beings of the world
 unke vichaar main kahin bhi lesh maatr bhi niraashaa kaa bhav nahin he
 The light of hope, faith and faith is highlighted in him
 isi alok ke kaaran gandhi ji ne dakshin-africa or bharat main jo jan-aandolan chalaae unhone sampoorn samaaj main nai jagriti, nai chetana or nayaa sankalp bhar diya
 His philosophy of life does not give rise to despair, despair and death-righteousness, but on the contrary, new hope, new faith and new zeal are born
 usase satya, ahimsa evam prem kii triveni pravaahit hoti he
 
 bhavani prasad mishra kii kavitaayen isi kaaran samaaj main jo vipann hai, laachaar hai, thake hue hai, dharashayi hai un sabko sahaara dene ke liye prerit karti hai, unako uthaane ke liye protsaahit karti hai"
 The new poem embraced the sensation, aesthetic sense, nature and questions of folk life on a simple and generous human land
 saath hi saath lok-jivan ke bimbon, pratikon, shabdon or upmaanon ko lok-jivan ke bich se chunakar usne apane ko atyadhik samvednapurna or sajiv banaaya
 The new poem cannot bear the overhead of the poem
 vah apni antarlay, bimbaatmakataa, naveen pratik-yojana, naye visheshnon ke prayog, naveen upmaan main kavita ke shilp kii maanya dharanaon se baaki alag he
 The language of the new poem does not work in any one way
 shashakt abhivyakti ke liye bolchaal kii bhashaa kaa prayog isamen adhik hua he
 In the new poem, not only Sanskrit words have been formed, but the prevalent words of different languages have been accepted
 nae shabd bhi bana liye gayi hai
 Toe, bhabhke, chhunna, whistle, chin, chuckle, chirpy, stump, virus, siraya, fungiana - many words are used indiscriminately in the new poem
 jisase isaki bhashaa main ek khulaapan or taazgi dikhaai detii he
 Its language also contains elements of folk language
 nai kavita main pratikon kii adhikta he
 Like - snake you have not been civilized, nor will you be, you have not come to settle in the city
 ek baat poonchhu? uttar doge! phir kaise siikhaa dansana? vish kahan paaya? nai kavita main bimb bhi vipul maatra main uplabdh he
 In the various compositions of the new poem, words, meanings, technicalities, free essays, daydreams, companionship, mythology, poetic images of nature have been created
 jaise- saamne mere sardi main bore ko odhakar, koi ek apane, haath pair samete, kaanp rahaa, hill rahaa,-vah mar jaayegaa
 In the new poem, the verses have received only a deep rejection - not only this, but various experiments have also been done in this field
 naye kaviyon main kisi bhi madhyam yaa shilp ke prati na to raag he or na viraag
 For the effect of dynamism, the new poetry has shifted to the change of sound by abandoning the rhythm of music
 ek varnya vishay yaa bhav ke sahare uskaa sangopang vivaran prastut karte hue lambii kavita yaa puri kavita likhakar use kavy-niabandh banane kii puraani style nai kavita ne tyaag di he
 Poets of new poetry have also written long poems
 kintu ve puraane prabandh kavy ke samaanaantar nahin he
 Each poet of a new poem has his own personal specialty
 nae kaviyon ke liye pradhan he sampreshan, na ki sampreshan kaa madhyam
 Thus we see that the new poem is a significant achievement both in terms of narrative and craft
 vaak baadha kisi manushya kii aisi sthiti ko kehete hai jisamen use aasaani se saadhaaran tarah se baatcheet karne main kathinaayee pesh aae
 This includes stuttering, stuttering and other types of speech
 dhyaan den ki mahaz kisi ke bolne ke alag lahaze ko vakbadha nahin kaha ja saktaa
 If a speech is unable to speak completely or to a large extent, it is called 'dumbness'
 vakbadhaayen maanvon main aam pai jaati hai - unke hone par bhi log safal va sukhi jivan ji sakate hai or bahut se upachaar bhi uplabdh hai
 For example, studies have found that 1% of Americans, ie 3 million Americans, stutter

 Numbers are mathematical objects used for measuring, counting, and naming
 1, 2, 3, 4 aadi prakritik sankhyaayein isaki sabase moolbhoot udhaaharan hai
 Apart from this, real numbers and other types of numbers are also used in modern science and technology
 sankhyaayein hamaare jivan ke dharre ko nirdharit karti hai
 Calvin has said about numbers that you do not know anything about a phenomenon if you cannot express it by numbers
 jivan ke kuch aise kshetron main bhi sankhyaon kii ahmiyat he jo itane aam nahin maane jate
 a difference of 0
001 seconds in a runner's time can also give him gold or deprive him of it
 kisi pahie ke vyas main ek centimetre ke hajaarwein hisse jitna fark use kisi ghadi ke liye bekaar kar saktaa he
 For identification of a person, his telephone number, number on the ration card, bank account number or roll number of examination are helpful
 sankhyaayein maanav sabhyataa jitani hi puraani hai
 The Eshmolian Museum in Oxford holds an Egyptian royal penitentiary symbolizing the monarchy, which holds a record of 1,20,000 prisoners, 4,00,000 oxen and 14,22,000 goats
 is ricard se jo 3400 isa purv se pehle kaa he, pataa chalata he ki pracheen kaal main log badi sankhyaon ko likhnaa jaanate the
 Of course the numbers must have started long before the Egyptians
 adimanav kaa ginati se itnaa vaasta nahin padataa tha
 He had a cave to live in, food would be found by hunting him with trees or weapons
 magar kareeb 10,000 saal pehle jab adimanvon ne gaanvon main bas kar kheti kaa kaam or pashupaalan aarambh kiya to unka jivan pehle se kahin adhik jatil ho gaya
 He felt the need to bring regularity in his public and family life along with his daily schedule
 unhen pashuon kii ginati karne, krishi upaj kaa hisaab rakhane, bhoomi kii paimaaish tathaa samay kii jaankaree ke liye sankhyaon kii jarurat padi
 Various civilizations were inhabited in different parts of the world such as Babylon, Egypt, India, China and many more places
 in sabhi sabhyataaon ne sambhavatya ek hi samay ke dauraan apni-apni sankhya-paddatiyon kaa vikaas kiya hoga
 Numbers are found in ancient clay statues of Babylonian inhabitants
 tej dhar vaali patali dandiyon se ve geeli mitti par shanku aakaar ke pratik chihnon kii khudaai karte, baad main inhen eenton kii shakl de dete
 Special symbols were used for one, ten, hundred etc
 in pratikon kii punrariti dwaara hi ve kisi sankhya ko pradarshit karte jaise ki 1000 ko likhane ke liye ve pratik chihn kaa sahaara lete
 Or ten numbers were written as 100
 babylonvasi kaaphi badi sankhyaon kii ginati ve 60 kii sankhya ke madhyam se hi karte, jaisaa ki aajkal ham sankhya 10 ke madhyam se apni ginati karte hai
 Ancient Egyptians also knew how to count large numbers and they had information about 365 days in a year

 Maharaja Ranjit Singh lost his eyesight at a young age due to smallpox

 On 12 April 1801, Ranjit assumed the title of Maharaja
 guru nanak ke ek vanshaj ne unki tajposhi sampann karai
 He made Lahore his capital and moved towards Amritsar in 1802
 maharaja ranjit ne afgaanon ke khilaaf kai ladaaiyaan ladiin or unhen pashchimi punjab kii ore khaded diya
 Now Pashtun region, including Peshawar, became their authority
 yah pehla mauka tha jab pashtunon par kisi gaiyr muslim ne raaj kiya
 After that, they also captured Peshawar, Jammu Kashmir and Anandpur
 pehali aadhunik bhartiya sena - "sikh khalsa sena" gathit karne kaa shrey bhi unheen ko jaataa he
 Under his patronage, Punjab was now a very powerful province
 isi taqatvar sena ne lambey arse tak britain ko punjab hadapney se roke rakhaa
 There was also an occasion when Punjab was the only province which was not occupied by the British
 british itihaaskaar je tii whealer ke mutabik, agar vah ek peedi puraane hote, to puure hindustaan ko hi fatah kar lete
 Maharaja Ranjit himself was illiterate, but greatly encouraged education and art in his kingdom
 unhone punjab main kanoon evam vyavastha kaayam kii or kabhi bhi kisi ko mrityudand nahin di
 His diocese was secular
 He also prohibited the jizya charged with Hindus and Sikhs
 kabhi bhi kisi ko sikh dharm apnaane ke liye vivash nahin kiya
 He installed marble and gold plated at Harimandir Sahib Gurdwara in Amritsar, since then it came to be known as Golden Temple

 Maharaja Ranjit died in 1839
 unki samadhi lahore main banavaai gai, jo aaj bhi vahaan kaayam he
 With his death, the British started clamping down on Punjab

 In 1798, when Zaman Shah returned from Punjab, he took control of Lahore
 dhire-dhire satluj se sindhu tak, jitani mislein raaj kar rahi thim, sabko usne apane vash main kar liya
 Between the Sutlej and the Yamuna, the Phulkis ruled the kingdom of Misl

 Ranjitsinh had many qualities of military leadership

 He was a man of dark complexion
 unki ek aankh sheetala ke prakope se chali gai thi
 But despite this he was stunning
 isliye jab tak vah jivit the, sabhi mislein dabi thim
 At that time the British kingdom had reached the Yamuna and the Phulkians, the king of Egypt, began to assume the dominion of the British state
 angrejon ne ranjitsingh ko is kaary se manaa kiya
 Ranjitsingh did not think it right to fight the British and made a pact that we would not extend our kingdom in front of Sutlej
 ranjitsingh ne francisi sainikon ko bulaakar, uski sainik kaman main apni sena ko vilayati dhang par taiyaar kiya
 Now he started attacking the southern, western and northern parts of Punjab and in ten years extended his kingdom to Multan, Peshawar and Kashmir
 ranjitsingh ne peshawar ko apane adhikaar main avashya kar liya tha, kintu us soobe par purna adhikaar karne ke liye use kai varshon tak kadaa sangharsh karnaa padaa tha
 He became the lord of the whole of Punjab; And he did not face the intervention of the British
 parantu jis samay angrejon ne napolian kii senaaon ke viruddh sikhon se sahaayta maangi thi, unhen praapt na hui
 Ranjitsinh changed the kingdom of Peshawar in 1808 AD to the name of his ambitious mother-in-law Sadakore
 kyonki yah angrejon kii agent mahila thi
 Ranjitsingh, after quarreling with his ill-fated mother-in-law, imprisoned him and took control of Hvdni's stronghold
 british sena kii ek tukdi ne bandi vidhwaa sadacor ko chhudaaya or adhikaar ko waapas dilaayaa
 Ranjit Singh did not want any quarrel with the British Army
 angrejon kii taraf se sandhi kii sharton ko bhang karne kaa aarope lagaaya ja saktaa tha
 Therefore, he started preparations silently, yet in 1809 AD, he made a treaty with Lord Minto
 yadhyapi is sandhi se maharaj ko sikhon main bahut apamaanit hona padaa tha
 Due to the above treaty, the Afghan state of Punjab and Afghanistan were able to terrorize it to some extent

 On hearing of Shah Mahmud's invasion of Kabul in 1811 AD and knowing that Mahmud intended to attack the ruler of Kashmir, he attacked Kashmir so that it would be possible for Mahmud to return and find his friendship

 1838 main peshawar par ranjitsingh ke adhikaar se bhaybheet hokar dostamohammad khan kabulanaresh bahut bhaybheet hua or rus tathaa iran se dosti kar lee
 Keeping this in mind, the British themselves organized a threesome with Ranjitsinh and Shahshuja

 It is about the year 1812
 punjab par maharaja ranjit singh kaa ecchhatra rajya tha
 At that time, Maharaja Ranjit Singh started a campaign to free Kashmir from the clutches of Atamohammad, the Subedar of Kashmir
 is abhiyaan se bhaybheet hokar atamohammad kashmir chhodkar bhaag gaya
 There was another reason behind the Kashmir campaign
 atamohammad ne mahmud shah dwaara parajeet shahshuja ko shergarh ke kile main kaid kar rakhaa tha
 To get her freed from captivity, her Begum Wafa Begum came to Lahore and prayed to Maharaja Ranjit Singh and said that you kindly release my husband from the captivity of Atma Mohammad, in exchange for this favor, the prized Kohinoor diamond will be presented to you
 shahshuja ke kaid ho jane ke baad vafa begum hi un dinon afghanistan kii shasika thi
 Zaman Shah, the grandson of Ahmad Shah Abdali, who invaded India in the greed to seize this Kohinoor, had his eyes taken out by his brother Mahmud Shah himself in the prison by terrible torture
 jamaan shah ahamed shah abdali ke bete taimur shah kaa betaa tha, jiskaa bhai tha mahmud shah
 Astu, Maharaja Ranjiti Singh himself wanted him to liberate Kashmir from Atamohammad
 at: suyog aane par maharaja ranjit singh ne kashmir ko aaazaad kara liya
 His Diwan Mohkamchand surrounded the fort of Shergarh and released Wafa Begum's husband Shahshuja and brought him to Lahore near Wafa Begum
 rajkumaar khadgasingh ne unhen mubarak haveli main tehraaya
 But Wafa Begum delayed the offering of Kohinoor diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh as promised
 yahaan tak ki kai maheene biit gaye
 When the Maharaja asked Shahshuja about the Kohinoor diamond, both he and his begum started making excuses
 jab zyada jor diya gaya to unhone ek nakli hira maharaja ranjit singh ko saunp diya, jo johariyon ke pareekshan kii kasuti par nakli sabit hua
 Ranjit Singh was filled with anger and Mubarak Haveli was surrounded
 do din tak vahaan khaanaa nahin diya gaya
 The first of June 1813 was when Maharaja Ranjit Singh came to Shahshuja and then inquired about Kohinoor
 dhoort shahshuja ne kohinoor apni pagadi main chipa rakhaa tha
 Somehow the Maharaja came to know about this
 at: unhone shahshuja ko kabul kii rajgaddi dilaane ke liye "gurugranth sahab" par haath rakhkar pratigya kii
 Then he changed his turban to Kohinoor to make him a "turban-changing brother"
 parde kii oot main baithi vafa begum maharaja kii chaturaai samaj gayi
 Now Kohinoor had reached Maharaja Ranjit Singh and he was satisfied that he had liberated Kashmir
 unki ichha thi ki ve kohinoor heere ko jagannathpuri ke mandir main pratishthit bhagwaan jagannatha ko arpit karen
 He was famous for offering mana gold to Hindu temples
 kaashi ke vishwanath mandir main bhi unhone akut sona arpit kiya tha
 But his desire to reach Jagannath God could not be fulfilled due to the treasurer of the treasurer Beliram
 maharaja ranjit singh kii mrityu ke pashchaat angrejon ne san 1845 main sikhon par akraman kar diya
 The Sikh army was bravely fighting the British in the Ferozepur region
 kintu sikh sena ke hi senapati lalasinh ne vishwasghaat kiya or morcha chhodkar lahore palaayan kar gaya
 Due to this, the Sikh army lost even after reaching near Vijay
 angrejon ne sikhon se kohinoor hira le liya
 At the same time, Kashmir and Hazara were also taken away from the Sikhs because the British had fined one and a half crores rupees to the Sikhs, the economically affected Sikhs were able to give only 50 lakh rupees in any way
 lard harding ne england kii rani victoria ko khush karne ke liye kohinoor hira landan pahunchaa diya, jo "east india company" dwaara rani victoria ko saunp diya gaya

 is prakaar kritrim garbhaadhan se jo bachche paidaa hote hai ve prakritik dhang se paidaa hue bacchon ke hi samaan balvan or hrishtpusht hote hai
 Six hundred years ago in 1322, an Arab chieftain succeeded in artificially conceiving a precious mare by extracting the semen of his enemy chieftain's horse
 europe main planis ne 1876 i
 main kritrim rup se ek kutiya ko garbhit kiya tha
 The first scientific investigation on artificial semen polling was done in 1780 AD by a famous scientist of Italian physiology, Abbott Splan Jani, over a bitch

 Artificial breeding of horse first started in 1890 AD

 Professor Hoffman said that in addition to natural insemination, if artificial insemination is also used, then insemination will be certain
 rus main ibanhalf se 1909 i
 main kritrim prajnan kii ek prayogshaala sthapit kii or 1912 i
 main 39 ghodiyon kii yoni main kritrim viryasechan kiya
 31 of them were conceived
 usee samay swabhaavik dhang se 23 anya ghediyon ko bhi garbhit kiya gaya, kintu unamem se keval 10 main hi garbhadhan hua
 This proved the importance of artificial insemination and its use started increasing and artificial insemination was started in other animals like sheep, cow and dog etc
 america main 1896 i
 main 19 kutiyon kii yoni main viryasechan kiya gaya, jinamein se 15 garbhit hui or bachche die
 As a result of this experiment, artificial semen was adopted by Europe and America very quickly
 is reeti kaa upyog saare sansar-england, italy, germany, sweden, denmark, austrailia, canada, china or rus aadi-main badi teji se bad rahaa he
 Artificial semen in India started in 1942 AD at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute
 tatpashchaat iske anek centre bengal, bihar, punjab, madras, madhyapradesh, bombai or uttar pradesh main khule
 Currently, there are thousands of artificial insemination centers in India and their number is increasing every year
 is prayog se ab har saal lakhon pashu garbhit kiye jate hai
 For this, semen is collected in many ways: by artificial vagina, mechanical handling and electrical stimulation etc
 veery ko ekatra karne ke uparaant kritrim garbhaadhan turant kar dena sabase acha hota he
 If artificial insemination cannot be performed immediately, the semen should be kept in a clean, sterile, or in a test tube, in a cool, 1
3 to 2
5 cm
 Can be placed on is dhang se veery teen se lekar paanch dinon tak garbhaadhan yogya rahata he
 Several types of solutions are also slowed by mixing in semen; But experiment has proved that the extract of semen is more useful
 veery ko ek vishesh dhang se sukhi barf dwaara jamaakar rakhaa jaataa he
 The semen is melted before it is used
 veery jamaane or uske upyog par sansar ke vibhinn bhaagon main bahut se anusandhan kaary ho rahe hai
 By using this, the semen of special young bulls can be sent easily from one country to another
 or har samay upyog ke liye saralata se mil saktaa he
 The semen thus deposited can be successfully used for two years
 jis samay maadaa pashu garam hoti he us samay uski punch ko uthaakar ekatrit veery ko uski yoni main pichakaari dwaara daal diya jaataa he
 According to nature, every female animal keeps warming at certain time and this time varies for every animal, like cow, buffalo and mare are warmed on the 21st day
 garam rahane kaa samay bhi bhinn-bhinn pashuon main bhinn hota he
 It lasts only 12 to 18 hours in cows and buffaloes and in mare for about a week
 garam avasthaa samaapt ho jane par, swabhaavik athwa kritrim rup se veery pravesh karaane par garbh nahin thahartaa
 In any natural way, when the conception is in the animal, then on the 21st day, the heating stops

 If a low-calf, two-milking cow is mated with a bull whose mother used to give 16 ser milk, then 12 ser in the second generation, 14 ser in the fourth generation and about 16 ser in the fifth generation
 achche saand ko dur tak bhejnaa kathin hota hai; parantu uttam tathaa ucch koti ke saand kaa veery saraltapurvak desh deshaantaron se, aadhunik vaigyanik reeti ke anusaar, har samay uplabdh ho saktaa he
 Naturally, a bull can conceive only 100 cows in a year; Artificial way, 1,000 can be conceived by the same bull
 kyonki ek baar ekatra kiya hua veery kam se kam 8-10 gaayon ko garbhit kar saktaa he or prasheetak main rakhane se kam se kam teen chaar din tak thik-thik purna shaktishaalee rahata he
 Many bulls are seen to be hatted, but due to the defect in semen, they do not become pregnant
 kritrim dhang main is baat kaa bhay nahin he kyonki garbhit karne ke pehle or baad veery kii jaanch purnat: kar lee jaati he
 Diseases do not occur in the genitals of cow, buffalo-mare etc
 due to artificial semen, which usually occur due to the contact of bulls
 choti gaay, bhens aadi ko ucch koti ke bade saand ke bade se bade saand ke veery kaa upyog choti se choti gauon aadi ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Children can also be conceived by artificial insemination to lulli, langi, bruised and waste cows, buffalo mare, etc

 anant bhagwaan anant ke liye hai tathaa sanskrit shabd puram kaa arth he ghar, vasasthaan
 It literally means Lord Eternal's abode
 bhagwaan anant, hindu manyataon ke anusaar, sheshnag hai jinpar bhagwaan vishnu kaa virajte hai

 Therefore, if the name of Thiruvananthapuram is transliterated from Malayalam, it is Thiruvananthapuram
 hindi main halant lagane kii aavashyakta to nahin he par chunki ye naam dakshin bhartiya he isliye isamen halant laga liya jaataa he
 In addition to this, some people use the long form, ie, Thiruvananthapuram instead of Harsva Ukaar, which is impure both in terms of transliteration and pronunciation
 dakshin bhartiya bhashaaon main t ke swar ko angrezi main Th se likhaa jaataa he, kyonki ise t likhane se, t kii maatra ke saath vibhed nahin ho paata he

 sati daksh prajapati kii putree or bhagwaan shiv kii patni thi
 The story of their origin and end is available in different forms in different Puranas
 shaiva puraanon main bhagwaan shiv kii pradhanta ke kaaran shiv ko param tatva tathaa shakti ko unki anugamini bataaya gaya he
 Parallel to this, Shakti Puranas have described Shakti as the supreme power and Lord Shiva as his follower
 shrimadbhagwatmahapurana main apekshaakrit tatasth varnan he
 It talks about the birth of 16 girls from the womb of maternity, daughter of Daksha's self-styled manu
 devipurana main 14 kanyaon kaa ullekh hua he tathaa shivpurana main daksh kii saath kanyaon kaa ullekh hua he jinamein se 27 kaa vivaah chandramaa se hua tha
 There was also a sati among these girls
 shivpurana ke anusaar brahma ji ko bhagwaan shiv ke vivaah kii chintaa hui to unhone bhagwaan vishnu kii stuti kii or vishnu ji ne prasann hokar brahma ji ko bataaya ki yadi bhagwaan shiv kaa vivaah karwaanaa he to devi shiva kii aradhana kiijie
 He told that he should ask Daksha to do penance of Bhagwati Shiva and appease him and ask for the boon of being his daughter
 yadi devi shiva prasann ho jaaegi to saare kaam safal ho jaaenge
 According to his statement, Brahma ji asked Daksha to do austerities of Bhagwati Shiva and Prajapati Daksha did severe penance of Goddess Shiva
 unki tapasya se prasann hokar shiva ne unhen vardaan diya ki main aap kii putree ke rup main janm luungi
 i am the maid of Lord Shiva in all births; Therefore, i will please Lord Shiva by doing austerities and become his wife
 saath hi unhone daksh se yah bhi kaha ki jab aapkaa aadar mere prati kam ho jayega tab usee samay main apane sharir ko tyaag duungi, apane swaroop main leen ho jaaongi athwa doosraa sharir dhaaran kar loongi
 He gave this boon to Daksha for every canto or kalpa
 tadnusaar bhagwati shiva sati ke naam se daksh kii putree ke rup main janm leti he or ghor tapasya karke bhagwaan shiv ko prasann karti he tathaa bhagwaan shiv se unka vivaah hota he
 The story after this is very much in line with the narrative described in the Srimad Bhagavathamaha Purana
 prayag main prajapatiyon ke ek yajna main daksh ke padhaarney par sabhi devatagan khadey hokar unhen aadar dete hai parantu brahma ji ke saath shivaji bhi baithe hi rah jate hai
 Due to his cosmic wisdom, considering Lord Shiva as his son, that is, like a son, Daksha feels insulted for not standing up to him and not showing respect to him and that is why he used many gimmicks towards Lord Shiva and offered him a sacrificial part Cursed to be deprived
 isi ke baad daksh or bhagwaan shiv main manomalinya utpann ho gaya
 Thereafter, a huge yajna was organized by Daksha in his capital Kankhal in which he neither invited Lord Shiva nor his daughter Sati
 sati ne rohinee ko chandramaa ke saath vimaan se jate dekha or sakhi ke dwaara yah pataa chalane par ki ve log unheen ke pita daksh ke viraat yajna main bhaag lene ja rahe hai, sati kaa man bhi vahaan jane ko vyakul ho gaya
 Despite the persuasion of Lord Shiva, Sati remained distraught and Lord Shiva with his ganas ordered him to go there
 parantu vahaan jaakar bhagwaan shiv kaa yajna-bhaag na dekhakar sati ne ghor aapatti jataayi or daksh ke dwaara apane tathaa unke pati bhagwaan shiv ke prati bhi ghor apmanjanak baaten kehane ke kaaran sati ne yogagni se apane sharir ko bhasma kar daalaa
 On being created by the Shivs, Bhrigu Rishi sacrificed in Dakshinagni and the deities named Ribhu, who were born out of it, drove the Shivgas
 is samachar se atyant kupit bhagwaan shiv ne apni jataa se virbhadra ko utpann kiya or virbhadra ne gana sahit jaakar daksh yajna kaa vidhwans kar daalaa; shiv ke virdohi devataaon tathaa rishiyon ko yathayogy dand diya tathaa daksh ke sir ko kaat kar havan kunda main jala daalaa
 After this, Lord Shiva was pleased to be praised by Brahma ji along with the gods, and again he recovered the damages incurred in the yajna and due to burning of the head of Daksh, he also got the goat's head alive
 phir unke anugrah se yajna purna hua
 Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are all believed to have originated with the grace of Shakti due to the predominance of Shakti in Shaktism
 devipurana main varnan hua he ki purna prakruti jagdambika ne hi brahama, vishnu or mahesh teenon ko utpann kar unhen sristi kaaryon main niyukt kiya
 He was the one who ordered Brahma to be the creator, Vishnu to be the follower and Shiva as his destroyer
 aadesh-paalan ke purv in teenon ne un parama shakti purna prakruti ko hi apni patni ke rup main paane ke liye tap aarambh kar diya
 Due to Jagadambika failing in the test, Brahma and Vishnu attained full nature as a wife and being pleased with the penance of Lord Shiva, Jagdambika herself gave birth and assured to become his wife
 tadnusaar brahma ji ke dwaara prerit kiye jane par daksh ne usee purna prakruti jagdambika kii tapasya kii or unke tap se prasann hokar jagdambika ne unki putree hokar janm lene kaa vardaan diya tathaa yah bhi bataa diya ki jab daksh kaa punya ksheen ho jayega tab vah shakti jagat ko vimohit karke apane dham ko laut jaaegi
 According to the boon, Purna Prakriti took birth as Daksha's daughter in the name of Sati and when she was eligible to marry, Daksha contemplated her marriage
 daksh apni loukik buddhi se bhagwaan shiv ke prabhaav ko na samajhane ke kaaran unke vesh ko amaryadit maanate the or unhen kisi prakaar sati ke yogya var nahin maanate the
 Therefore, considering this, he organized a zero swayamvar meeting with Lord Shiva and requested Sati to choose the groom according to his choice
 bhagwaan shiv ko upasthit na dekh kar sati ne 'shivaay namah' kah kar varmala prithvi par daal di tathaa maheshwar shiv swayan upasthit hokar us varmala ko grahan kar sati ko apni patni banaakar kailash laut gayi
 Daksha was very sad
 apni ichha ke viruddh sati ke dwaara shiv ko pati chun liye jane se daksh kaa man un donon ke prati kshobh se bhar gaya
 That is why Daksha did not invite Shiva and Sati in the Virat Yajna organized in his capital later
 phir bhi sati ne apane pita ke yajna main jane kaa hath kiya or shiv ji ke dwaara baar-baar rokane par atyant kupit hokar unhen apana bhayanak rup dikhaaya
 This describes Shiva's escape after being horrified and Jagdambika took 10 forms to stop him
 phir shivaji ke poochne par unhone apane dashon roopon kaa parichay diya
 Then after Shiv ji's apology, Purna Prakriti smiled and was eager to go to the yagna of her father Daksha, then Shiv ji told her sorrow and ordered a chariot attached to the majority of lions and got Bhagwati sent to Bhagwati's house with respect
 shesh katha katipay antaron ke saath purvavarnit katha ke praayah anuroop hi he, parantu is katha main kupit sati chhayasati ko lila kaa aadesh dekar antardhan ho jaati he or us chhayasati ke bhasma ho jane par baat khatm nahin hoti balki shiv ke prasann hokar yajna purnataa kaa sanket de dene ke baad chhayasati kii laash surakshit tathaa dedeepyaman rup main daksh kii yajyashala main hi punah mil jaati he or phir devi shakti dwaara purv main hi bhavishyavaanee rup main bataa die jane ke baavjood loukik purush kii tarah shivaji vilaap karte hai tathaa sati kii laash sir par dhaaran kar veikshipt kii tarah bhatakate hai
 With this, Lord Vishnu cuts the corpse of Sati from the Sudarshan Chakra, in succession, to break the stricken deities and take care of the situation
 is prakaar sati ke vibhinn ang tathaa aabhushanon ke vibhinn sthanon par girane se ve sthaan shaktipeeth kii mahima se yukt ho gayi
 In this way 51 Shaktipeeths were constructed
 phir sati kii laash na rah jane par bhagavan shiv ne jab vyakulatapurvak devataaon se prashn kiya to devataaon ne unhen sari baat bataayi
 Relinquishing this, Lord Shiva cursed Lord Vishnu by incarnating him in the Suryavansha in the Treta Yuga to separate from his wife and then worshiped Bhagwati in 51 Shaktipeeths in the most prominent 'kamarupa' and by that perfect nature The next time, in the Himalayan house, Parvati received the boon of becoming his wife again by taking Purnavatar
 is prakaar yahi sati agle janm main parvati ke rup main himalay kii putree banakar punah bhagwaan shiv ko patni rup main praapt ho gayi
