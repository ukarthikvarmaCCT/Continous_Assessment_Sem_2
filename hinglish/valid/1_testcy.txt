 According to the news of s Showbiz, 'sharon (61) told that only Ozzy knew this story
 unhone apane teenon bacchon se bhi is bare main kabhi charchaa nahin kii
 He said, 'I never discussed about it
 main yahi sochati hum ki tab main kitni murkh thi
 At that time i was 27 years old and i used to spend time with OG
 ' unhone bataaya, 'ham aksar jashn manaaya karte
 Once Ozzy asked me, how much do you love me? And i said then i can do anything for you, i really want you and i can give my life for you too
 'shiron ne kaha, 'tab main yah dikhaane ko tatpar thi ki main usase kitna pyaar karti hum or main uske liye jaan bhi de sakati hum

 ' The tension of Doklam is visible everywhere on the india-china border, so the army's preparations are not only in Sikkim but also in the snowy areas of Ladakh
 ladakh main chini seemaa ke paas aakhri gaanv tak ajtak kii team pahunchi
 When China was attacked by India in 1962, it also started calling Ladakh its territory 
 tab bharat ke paas is ilaake main kuch bhi nahin tha
 But today India has become so cautious that it has made all preparations in Ladakh
 china hameshaa apane ilaake main construction karata rahaa he, bharat karata he to wo roktaa he, lekin ab bharat in sadakon par kaam kar rahaa he, apane ilaake main bana rahaa he
 China captured a large part of Aksai China in the 1962 war
 aaj bhichini sainikonper se 1962 ke yuddh kaa hangover utraa nahin he
 But the preparations of our army show that now if China turns its eyes, bad days will start for it
 yahaan rahane vaale logon ko aaj china se dar nahin lagata kyonki inhen apane javaanon par pakkaa yakeen he
 Ladakh is decisive for India
 lekin vahaan seemaa par aakhri gaanv tak bijli nahin pahunch pai he, un buniyadi jaruraton ke liye kaam karne kii jarurat he
 On one hand, China is showing its grandeur in Doklam near Sikkim and India is aware of its greedy eye on Ladakh
 bharat ke liye ladakh kii ahmiyat is baat se bhi bad jaati he ki china bagal main pakistani kabje vaale kashmir main special iconomi jone bana rahaa he, yani ladakh to teen taraf se china gher saktaa he
 The increasing interference of China in Pakistan is indicating the collapse of Pakistan's entire economy in the hands of China
 agar china ke special iconomic jone ko parakhen to-gilgit-baltistan main mokpondas sez-khaybar pakhtunava main mohammad marble city-pioke main bheembar industril jone-punjab ke shekhpura main punjabruchin ichnomic jone-singh ke dhabeji main china sez-khaybar pakhtunava ke naushera main rasaakai ichnomic jone vah bana rahaa he
 Not only this, China is also preparing nine power projects for Pakistan in between Kashmir to Gwadar
 saaf he ki pakistan main china kii is taiyaari ke khatre bharat ke liye bad jate hai
 China's presence in Pakistani-occupied Kashmir means that it is laying claim to the land of India and the presence of the Chinese Army in pok will always remain a major threat to India
 in sabake bich bharat main pakistan ke ucchayukta abdul bashit kaa china or bhutan ke rajdoot se milanaa bataata he ki bharat china ke bich tanatani main pakistan bhi kud rahaa he
 It is clear that China is also fighting a psychological war by keeping an eye on its entry into Pakistan and Ladakh
 desh main swine flu kii chapet main aae logon kii taadaad 711 tak pahunch gai he

 gudgaanv main ab tak swine flu ke 26 mariz saamne aa chuke hai
 Delhi currently has four screening centers for swine flu screening
 sarkaar saat auki centre bananaa chaahati he lekin ye centre kab banenge tay nahin he
 School children are at greater risk of swine flu The school children are at the highest risk, so the West Bengal government has issued a directive to all schools to be alert to swine flu
 swine flu ko lekar dablyuechao duniya ke mulkon ko july maheene main hi chetavanee jari kar chukaa he, lekin ab bhi aisi koi vaxin nahin he, jisase swine flu ke kahar se bachaa ja sake

 Would never had been reason not to be there On the second date of the month of Ashadh, the Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath is celebrated
 ahmedabad main aaj yani 14 july se bhagwaan jagannatha kii 141veen rathyatra shuru ho gai he
 The Rath Yatra in Ahmedabad has started from the main temple of Lord Jagannath, after which the Rath Yatra will go to Ranchoddas Temple in Saraspur
 iske alaava odisha ke puri main bhi bhagwaan jagannatha kii rathyatra shuru ho chuki he
 In this yatra, Lord Jagannath is taken out of his womb home once a year and traveling
 bhagwaan jagannatha ke saath bhagwaan krishna, unke bhai balram or bahan subhadra ko bhi rath main baitaakar yatra karai jaati he
 This festival is celebrated for a full 9 days
 yatra ke peeche yah manyata he ki bhagwaan apane garbh grih se nikalakar praja ke sukh-dukh ko khud dekhte hai
 The significance of the Puri Jagannath Yatra of Odisha is the most famous Rath Yatra of Puri in Odisha
 puraanon main jagannatha puri ko dharti kaa baikunth kaha gaya he
 According to Brahma and Skanda Purana, Lord Vishnu was incarnated in Puri as Purushottam Neelmadhav
 vah yahaan sabar janajati ke param poojya devtaa ban gaye
 Being the deity of the Sabar tribe, Lord Jagannath's form here is like tribal gods
 odisha ke jagannatha mandir kii mahima desh main hi nahin vishwa main bhi prasiddh hai
 Know why 13th and Friday are considered inauspicious, know the reason why the secret of Lord Jagannath and his Rath Yatra is three different chariots are built for Balarama, Shri Krishna and Goddess Subhadra for Lord Jagannath's Rath Yatra
 rathyatra main sabase aage balraamji kaa rath, uske baad bich main devi subhadra kaa rath or sabase peeche bhagwaan jagannatha shrikrishna kaa rath hota he
 It is identified by their color and height
 puri main bana jagannatha mandir bharat main hinduon ke chaar dhaamon main se ek he
 This dham telescope is considered more than 800 years old
 bhagwaan jagannatha kaa nandighosh rath 45
 6 feet high, Baladhaji's Taladhwaj Chariot 45 feet high and Goddess Subhadra's Darpadalan Chariot 44
 6 feet ooncha hota he
 There are some miraculous things associated with Jagannath Puri temple that surprise everyone - the flag on the summit of Jagannath temple always wave in the opposite direction of the wind
 - isi tarah mandir ke shikhar par ek sudarshan chakra bhi he
 Looking at this chakra from any direction, it seems that the face of the chakra is on your side
 masik shivaratri par raashi anusaar karen shiv puja- mandir kii rasoi main prasad pakaane ke liye 7 bartan ek-duusare ke upar rakhe jate hai
 This prasad is cooked on wood in pottery
 is dauraan sabase upar rakhe bartan kaa pakwaan pehle pakataa he phir neeche kii taraf se ek ke baad ek prasad pakataa jaataa he
 - When you take the first step from the temple's lion gate, you cannot hear the sound of the waves coming from the sea
 aashcharya main daal dene vaali baat yah he ki jaise hi aap mandir se ek kadam baahar rakhenge, vaise hi samudr kii aawaaj sunai dene lagati he
 This experience feels even more unusual in the evening
 - hamane zyaadaatar mandiron ke shikhar par pakshi baithe or udate dekhe hai
 This thing of Jagannath temple will surprise you that no bird passes over it
 yahaan tak ki hawaii jahaaj bhi mandir ke upar se nahin nikalataa
 - The prasad made every day in the temple never diminishes for the devotees, as well as the prasad also ends as the temple closes
 - din ke kisi bhi samay jagannatha mandir ke mukhya shikhar kii parchaai nahin banati
 - a priest changes the flag on the 45-storey summit of the temple daily
 aisi manyata he ki agar ek din bhi jhanda nahin badla gaya to mandir 18 varshon ke liye band ho jayega
 - Normally, the air moving in the day moves from the sea to the earth and in the evening, from the earth to the sea
 chakit kar dene vaali baat yah he ki puri main yah prakriya ulti he

 Neither eight months spent in jail nor eight months were able to break him out of Gujarat
 unki ladaai abhi khatm nahin hui he
 Hardik says that he supported the Congress so that he could break the arrogance of the BJP and avenge the death of 14 Patels in the 2015 police firing
 unhone kaha tha ki patel andolan kaa siyaasi partiyon se koi lenaa-dena nahin tha, unhone to bas aarakshan hasil karne ke liye aisa kiya
 He said that his agitation would continue even after the results of Gujarat
 bhaajapa ke khilaaf hardik ke lagaataar tikhe abhiyaan kaa koi asar madhya or dakshin gujarat ke patelon par nahin padaa
 In North Gujarat too, the huge crowd that gathered to see them, also did not fill the opposition's bag with indiscriminate votes
 saurashtra main alabatta unhone bhaajapa ko 12 siton se haath dhone ko majaboor kar diya or uski kul siton main khaasi send lagaai
 It seems that the problems of the BJP will still remain on the Patel issue
 lihaaja, agar party ko 2019 ke loksabhaa chunaav main apni naiya paar lagaani he, to uske liye behad jaruri he ki vah is andolan kii aag par pani daale
 Hardik has rejected the party's efforts to assert itself on the issue of reservation — the BJP has passed a bill to provide 10 per cent reservation to economically backward classes, which Gujarat in light of the Supreme Court's 49 per cent upper limit on reservation The High Court has challenged
 hardik ne bhaajapa ke kadam ko yah kahkar khaarij kar diya ki patel keval obisi cote ke tahat aarakshan chaahate hai
 However, on the eve of Gujarat elections, he accepted the offer made by the Congress in return for this
 saaf tha ki hardik ne bhaajapa kii haar pakki karne kaa bidaa uthaa liya tha
 They failed in their cause, but they have shaken the saffron party badly
 siyaasi pandit pasopesh main hai ki chunaav ke baad patel andolan main vahi teji aa paaegi yaa nahin, khaskar is baat ko dekhte hue ki vah bhaajapa ko satta se bedakhal karne main naakaam ho chukaa he
 Yet the movement has provided a platform to Hardik
 siyasat main aupchaarik kadam rakhane ke liye abhi unki umr kam he or agali july main hi vidhansabha seat kii paatrata hasil kar sakenge
 His colleagues Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mewani, who have created political turmoil, have become mlas
 alpesh congress ke vidhayak hai or jignesh congress ke samarthan se jite nirdaleey vidhayak hai
 Until the next election in 2022, when he will be eligible to contest, it can prove difficult for Hardik to keep himself grounded in the political arena
 in chunaavon main unhone apane samudaay ke logon se 2015 kii police golibari main maare gaye 14 patelon kii maut kaa badla lene ke liye bhaajapa ke khilaaf vot dene kii guzarish kii thi
 But revenge is something that you cannot take twice
 beshak ab tak ke unke safar ko dekhte hue hardik kuch apratyaashit bhi kar sakate hai
 The Congress party with which Patel had kept distance from the past two decades, his association with the same Congress may continue for a few more years
 philhal 2017 ke gujarat chunaavon ke tamaashe kaa paradaa gir chukaa he
 But as long as he is on the scene, Hardik will continue to be a cause of concern for the BJP

 -input IANS se The Congress has started its election campaign on Friday with a new advertisement featuring Rahul Gandhi's picture, but the party suffered a lot of embarrassment
 vipakshi bijepi ne congress ke is vigyaapan kii khinchaai karte hue kaha ki isamen jis tagaline kaa istemaal kiya gaya he, vah narendra modi ne aaj se teen saal pehle kaha tha
 Party Vice President Rahul Gandhi is at the forefront in this new advertisement of Congress printed in all major newspapers on Friday and some people are shown standing on both sides behind him
 is vigyaapan main sabase upar likhaa he, 'main nahin, ham'
 The BJP immediately objected to this advertisement, saying that Narendra Modi, the party's candidate for the post of Prime Minister, had said this line in the 2011 Chintan Camp held in Gujarat
 bijepi ke pradhanmantri pad ke ummidavaar narendra modi ne bhi ek bayaan jari kar rahul gandhi par apni theme kii nakal karne kaa aarope lagaaya he
 At the same time, senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha has described the Congress as 'copycat'
 iske alaava bijepi netaa shahanvaj hossain ne congress par kataaksh karte hue kaha, nakal ke liye bhi akal chahie
 The Congress hates Narendra Modi, but likes his slogans
 rahul unka naaraa to chura sakate hai, lekin vah modi jaisaa anubhav or unki kaary kshamta kahaan se laaenge?' Embarrassed by the controversy, the Congress argues that they have no copy right on this line
 party ke ek pravaktaa ne kaha, 'yah hamaara asli naaraa nahin he

 India told China that Kashmir and Ladakh were our internal affairs
 Sri Lanka welcomed India's decision
 India got uae's support
 Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India
 aisa bas kaha jaataa tha
 With the elimination of special status given to Jammu and Kashmir by abolishing certain provisions of Article 370, Kashmir will now become like the normal Union Territories
 somvaar kaa din bharat ke liye aitihaasik din rahaa
 India made history by putting the proposal of Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act in Parliament
 bharat ne ishaaron hi ishaaron main saaf kar diya ki kashmir hamaare liye 'mudda' nahin he, kashmir par liya gaya har faisla bharat kaa aantarik nirnay he, jisamen kisi bhi antarrashtriya samudaay kaa hastkshep sweekaar nahin he
 There are only a few countries that have said anything against India on the removal of Article 370
 lekin kuch kii chintaaen is baat kii hai ki jammu-kashmir kii raajnneeti main sakriy kuch netaaon kii giraftaar kyon hui he
 us's eye on Kashmir: American Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said that we are closely watching every activity happening in Jammu and Kashmir
 hamane bharat ke us ghoshnaa par sangyaan liya he, jiske jariye unhone apane samvidhan main jammu-kashmir kii yathasthiti main badlaav kiya he
 This statement of the US State Department has come at a time when America has shown interest in resolving the issue between India and Kashmir
 america ke raashtrapati donald trump yah kah chuke hai ki agar bharat chahega to america bharat or pakistan ke bich chal rahe kashmir mudde ko sulajhane main madad karegaa
 Morgan Ortagus also said that we are worried that some people have been arrested in (kashmir)
 hamen vyaktigat adhikaron kaa sammaan karnaa chahie
 Especially those who have a crisis over their rights
 ham sabhi pakshon se apil karte hai ki line of control par shanti barti jaae
 UN appeal, exercise restraint on the border Two former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti were under house arrest since Sunday night

 sanyukt raashtra ne bharat or pakistan se apil kii he, donon raashtra seemaa par sanyam baraten
 United Nations spokesman Stephen Dujarric said the world is watching every activity happening in Kashmir
 ham us kshetra main bad rahe tanaav par najar rakh rahe hai
 We are appealing to India and Pakistan to exercise restraint
sri Lanka came bharat ke samarthan main aayaa srilankajammu-kashmir se ladakh kshetra ke alag hone par jis desh kii sabase sarthak pratikriya ai, vah he srilanka
 Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Vikramsanghe tweeted that the path has been cleared for the separation of Ladakh from Jammu and Kashmir
 ladakh kii 70 fisadi aabaadi buddha dharm se taalluk rakhti he
 In such a situation, Ladakh will be the first Indian state, where Buddhist majority

 Criticism of Islamic organizations is not unexpected
 pakistan ek islamic desh he, aise main unki pratikriya kahin se pratyaashit nahin lagi
 But it is India's diplomacy due to which the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the most powerful country of Islamic organizations, has welcomed the Government of India's initiative on Kashmir
 samarthan main uaejammu-kashmir se anuchhed 370 hataae jane ko sanyukt arab emirate (yuai) ne bharat kaa aantarik maamla bataaya
 He said that the UAE has removed two provisions of Article 370 by the Government of India, on which the UAE has taken cognizance
 bharat main yuai ke rajdoot dow
 Ahmed Al Banna said that apart from Article 370, we have also taken cognizance of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill, which will make Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir two union territories
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki rajyon kaa punargathan swatantra bharat ke itihaas main koi ajeeb ghatana nahin he
 It aims to reduce regional inequality and improve efficiency
 unka maananaa he ki jammu-kashmir ko lekar narendra modi sarkaar ne jo faisla liya he, vah uskaa aantarik masalaa he, jo bhartiya samvidhan dwaara nirdhaarit he
 India has given information to every country Foreign Secretary of India and officials of Ministry of External Affairs are explaining to foreign ambassadors living in India that India's decision on Kashmir is an internal issue
 rus main bhartiya rajdoot bala venkatesh verma ne mangalvaar ko kaha ki main aaj subah videsh mantralay main tha
 i have informed my colleagues in the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding India's decision
 ham apane kareebi doston ko puri tarah se kashmir ke maamle main jaankaree dete rahenge

 China's position on the Kashmir issue is clear and consistent
 ye mudda bharat or pakistan ke bich itihaas kii viraasat he, jise antarrashtriya samudaay kii najar he
 Hua Chuning said that the parties concerned should exercise restraint
 saavdhaanee se kaam karnaa chahie, khaas taur par aisi karravaayiyon se bachanaa chahie jo yathasthiti main ekatarfa badlaav karen or tanaav ko badhayen
 China has also objected to calling Ladakh a union territory of India, saying that there are disputed areas between the two countries that affect China's territorial integrity and sovereignty
 is par nai dilli ne apni pratikriya main saaf kiya ki bharat ‘seemaa kaa mudda’ aapas main shantipurna tareeke se sulajhane ke liye patibaddh he
 On India's comment to China on China's issue of Jammu and Kashmir, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ravish Kumar has said that the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill 2019 is an internal matter related to the territory of India
 bharat anya deshon ke aantarik maamalon par tippanee nahin karata he
 Similarly, other countries are also expected not to interfere in the internal affairs of India
 pravaktaa raveesh kumaar ne kaha ki jahaan tak bharat-china seemaa kaa sambandh he, vahaan donon paksh seemaa mudde ke niptaare ke liye raajnneetik maapdandon or maardarshak siddhanton ke aadhaar par uchit or parsparik rup se niptaare ke liye sahamat hue hai
 In such a situation, India has made it clear that India will not tolerate external intervention of any country in its internal affairs
 bharat kaa nirnay apni samprabhutaa ke liye saaf he, jisamen kisi bhi antarrashtriya sanghathanon ke dakhal kii koi jagah nahin he
 Yes it's sabotage, our security agency and admin who are handling the crowd well
