 yah muralidharan kaa 61waan 5 wicket lene kaa karnama tha
 Warne believed that Muralitharan would take "1000 wickets" before retiring from this game
 Former record holder Courtney Walsh also opined that if Muralitharan maintains his wicket hunger, it will be possible
 Muralitharan himself believed that it is likely that he will reach this milestone

 unhen navdith ajanta mendis dwaara acchhee tarah se samarthan mila jo atyant vividhta ke saath gendbaaji karne vaale ek aparamparaagat spinner hai jinhone apane pehle match main aath wicket liye the
 Muralitharan believed that the emergence of Mendis would help to prolong his career
 The 36-year-old Muralitharan and the 23-year-old Mendis formed a formidable partnership in India's crushing defeat in the first Test, both sharing 19 of the 20 wickets
 "agar vah is tarah se pradarshan karata he to nishchit rup se antarrashtriya cricket main bahut saare wicket praapt karegaa

 Due to the variations of Test cricket, the grounds on which the matches were played and the grounds on which the opposition team played against them, it is very difficult and subjective to compare the quality of the top level players in this way

 It is also noteworthy that Muralitharan's record against Australians in ODI matches has not been very good and this is proved again when he was ineffective in the 2007 World Cup final match; Gilchrist was the main player to harass him

 Former Sri Lankan coach and former Australian Test cricketer Tom Moody said he was embarrassed by the outrageous reaction and negative attention received by the Australian audience targeting Muttiah Muralitharan

 Although he has been cited three times, a subsequent biochemical test allowed him to continue the charge by the ICC and allow him to continue bowling

 Initial concerns over whether Muralitharan's bowling style violated the rules of the game by keeping his bowled arm straight while throwing the ball were ruled an illegal style by Australian umpire Darrell Hair during a Boxing Day Test in Melbourne, Australia in 1995
 After what he described as "no-ball" seven times, it started as an open dispute
 das din baad, 5 janvari 1996 ko trikoniya vishwa shrinkhalaa pratiyogita ke saatven ekadivasiy match main srilanka ne brisben main westeindies kaa saamana kiya
 In the beginning of his international career, umpire Ross Emerson called him a no-ball three times in Muralitharan's first over, twice on the second ball and twice on the third ball
 This was similar to the decision Boxing Day made by Heyer and Emerson made the decision from the bowling end while his teammates stood quietly
 mukhya antar yah tha ki kai no-ball gendbaaj ke saamaanya of-brake kii bajaay leg-brake the
 Just before the World Cup in February 1996, Muralitharan underwent biochemical analysis at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology under the supervision of Professor Ravindra Gunatilke, who cited Muralitharan's style of birth in his arm in test conditions citing a congenital defect Legalized which makes them unable to straighten it completely, but completely with the arm He gives the impression of erectile dysfunction

 Although Muralitharan's bowling style remained suspect during the Australia tour in 1998–99, he was dubbed a no-ball once again by Ross Emerson during a one-day international against England at the Adelaide Oval in Australia
 srilankai team ne match ko lagbhag chhod diya tha lekin srilanka main cricket control board ke adhyaksh se praapt nirdeshon ke baad khel phir se shuru ho gaya

 kisi bhi str par muralidharan ne isisi dwaara apni style ko badalane yaa nayaa rup dene kaa anurodh nahin kiya
 Till this point of his career, Muralitharan continued to bowl mainly in two types of bowling ie off-break and topspinner
 He had not yet mastered the 'second'
 muralidharan ne gendbaaji karnaa jari rakhaa, unhone 16 march 2004 ko candi main australia ke khilaaf duusare test match main apana 500waan test wicket liya
 His 'second' ball at the end of the series was officially questioned by match referee Chris Broad
 His hand was measured with a three-dimensional kinematics system by Muralitharan while throwing an 'other' type of ball using an optical motion capture system at Western Australia University

 The report, sent to the ICC by a Western Australia University study, concluded that Muralitharan's 'second' violated the icc's elbow extension limit for spinners
 cricket ke mul gend phenkane ke niyamon ke tahat sthanapann ampire par aisi gend ko "no-ball" qaraar dene kaa daayitv tha jiske bare main ve puri tarah se sahamat nahin the ki yah bilkul uchit tha

 But these figures proved difficult to implement because the umpires were unable to guess the difference between the exact amount of detail and the three different acceptable figures

 The ability of various physical movements in a match, such as "elbow extension" by digitizing the segment ind-point, especially when you have segment rotation, is very difficult to do and can cause errors

 It is therefore not surprising that laboratory testing is preferred, particularly for spin bowlers where a reasonable pitch length and run-up structure can be designed

 a laboratory kinematic analysis conducted by Ferdinands and Karsting on 42 bowlers who did not play a test match determined that the 5 ° range was particularly impractical for slow and spin bowlers

 a panel of former Test players consisting of Arvind de Silva, Angus Fraser, Michael Holding, Tony Lewis, Tim in and icc's Dave Richardson, in collaboration with several biochemical experts, stated that 99 out of all bowlers in the history of cricket % Straighten your hand while bowling

 Most of these reports have not been published controversially and 99% of the data reported thus far is yet to be proved

 Muralitharan was condemned by the Sri Lankan Cricket Board for these comments

 Based on these recommendations, the ICC issued a new guideline for acceptance of 15 degree extension or excessive extension for all types of bowlers, thus recognizing Muralitharan's 'second'
 yah samajhaate hue ki 15 degree ke str par kyon pahunchaa gaya, panel ke sadsy anges frager ne kaha tha "yahi vah sankhya he jise jaev rasayan vigyaani kehete hai ki yah dikhaai dene yogya he
 In the style of a bowler, it is difficult to see below 15 degrees with the naked eye
 hamen yah tab mila jab haath kii machhliyaan kandhe tak pahunchi, mode kii maatra 165 degree ke aasapaas thi
 Very rarely do bowlers reach 180 degrees because joints do not help
 
 lekin jab aap 15 degree se aage badhate hai aap ek aise kshetra main pravesh karte hai jo aapako ek anuchit laabh dena shuru kar detaa he or aap kaanoon kaa ulanghan karte hai
 " gendbaaji ke 'doosraa' ection ko anumati nahin dene ke mul nirnay ko vyapak rup se nyyochit mana gaya kyonki vah vaigyanik aadhaarit tha
 Therefore, a team of Australian scientists representing the University of South Australia conducted an independent research, to resolve the contentious issue arising out of 'second' based on modern artificial information and bio-mechanics

 The findings of this study, based on scientific facts, were very strong, and ICC General Manager Dave Richardson said that the ICC is currently reviewing the law of throwing and the ICC rules and a study by Professor Mahinda Pathegama with scientists from the University of South Australia In this case it will be quite important

 In July 2004, Muralitharan was shot in England bowling with an arm belt
 is film ko 2004 main england 22 julyke khilaaf test ke dauraan britain ke channel 4 par dikhaaya gaya
 The documentary is not available for sale and was not broadcast in Australia
 shuruyaat main muralidharan ne thik usee tarah teen genden daaleen jaise wo kisi match main khel rahe hon – of spinner, top spinner or 'doosraa'
 uske baad unhone unheen teen tarah kii gendon ko steel ke baar se bani pattee ke saath daali, ise majboot raal main sthapit kiya gaya tha
 This bandage was shielded on his right arm, which is 46 centimeters in length and weighs just over one kilogram
 khud par is pattee kaa istelam karne vaale tivi pragenter mark nicholas ne pushti kii or kaha ki "jab baanh is pattee se bandhi ho to iske mudane yaa jhukne kii koi gunjaaish hi nahin he
 "all three balls reacted the same way as they were without a strip
 haa, ye genden utani raftaar se nahin phenki ja sakin kyonki pattee ke vajan kii vajah se muralidharan ke baaju ke ghumaav ko thodaa dhimaa kar diya tha lekin gend main ghumaav phir bhi tha
 Despite being bandaged, his action flick appeared
 film ko jab alag-alag raftaar par adhyayan kiya gaya tab dikhaa jaise wo apni baanh ko sidhaa kar rahe hon, jabaki pattee kii vajah se aisa karnaa naammumkin tha
 Seeing the unique rotation of his shoulder and the amazing action of the wrists, he creates such an illusion as if he is straightening his arm
 of spinner ne kaha ki ye saare abhyaas gendbaaji ection kii isisi jaanch ko prabhavit karne ke liye nahin balki sashankit janata ko vishwaas dilaane ke liye the, yah jaanch march, 2004 main match referi kris broad dwaara unke 'doosraa' gend ke khilaaf shikaayat darj karaane ke baad shuru hui thi; ye teesraa mauka tha jab unki gendbaaji par karrwai kii gai thi
 In an interview in the August 2004 issue of Wisden Asia Cricket, Muralitharan had said, "I think it would prove to be a fact for those who used to say that it is physically impossible to throw balls that rotate the other way
" maine sabit kar diya he ki bina baanh ko mode bhi 'doosraa' gend daalana sambhav he
 " 2004 main colombo ke aar premdasa stadium main muralidharan ne khud se live video camaron ke saamne jaanch kii ek shrinkhalaa kaa pradarshan kiya
 Michael Slater and Ravi Shastri witnessed this
 muralidharan ne ek baar phir sabit kiya ki wo 'doosraa' samet apni sabhi tarah kii genden baanh main pattee baandhakar bhi kar sakate hai jo kohni ko sidhaa hone se rokatii he
 Orthopedic doctor Mandeep Dillan said Muralitharan has a unique ability to create extra movement from his shoulder as well as the wrist so that he can throw the 'second' marigold without straightening the elbow
 muralidharan ke do sabase bade aalochak rahe hai purv australian cricketer dean jones or bharat ke purv captain bishan singh bedi
 baad main dean jones ne jab murali ko pattee baandh kar gendbaaji karte dekha to unhone sweekaar kiya ki murali ke bare main unki raay galat thi
 Former West Indies fast bowler Michael Holding was also a critic of Muralitharan, but withdrew his criticism after being investigated
 holding ne kabhi ye kaha tha ki wo murali kii gendbaaji ection par bedi kii raay se 110% sahamat the, bedi ne murali kii gendbaaji ke ection ko "bhaalaa phenk" or abhi haal hi main "gola phenk" se tulana kii thi
 After the ICC study, Holding, as a member of the study panel, stated, "scientific evidence is very powerful
 

 nangi ankhon se dekhne par jab kisi gendbaaj kaa ection bilkul sahi jaan padataa he, usee kaa jab aaj maujuud atyaadhunik takanic kii madad se vishleshan kiya jaataa he, to usee gendbaaji ke ection main baanh 11 degree or kai maamalon main 12 degree tak sidhi hoti dikhaai padati he
 Under strict interpretation of the law, these players are breaking the rules
 is khel ko is sachai kaa saamana karnaa hi padegaa or is par bhi faisla karnaa hoga ki kaise is tathy ko shaamil kiya jaae
" In May 2002, during an event at Carlton Football Club, Adam Gilchrist claimed that Muralitharan's action was not in accordance with the rules of cricket
 melbern ke akhbaar age ne gilcrist ke hawaale se likhaa tha,"haa, main samajhataa hum ki wo aisa ) karte hai or main aisa isliye kah rahaa hum kyonki aap agar khel ke niyamon ko padhenge, to mere dimag main koi shaq nahin he ki wo or kai anya cricket ke itihaas main aisa karte rahe hai
 "this comment was made even before the 'second' controversy surfaced, despite Muralitharan's action being approved by the ICC in 1996 and 1999
 is tippanee ke liye gilcrist ko australian cricket board ne fatkaar bhi lagaai thi or use asibi ke "hanikaarak saarvajanik tippanee" ke tahat niyamon kaa ulanghan mana tha
 During a 2006 visit to New Zealand, another critic of Muralitharan, former New Zealand captain and cricket reader Martin Crowe, said that Muralitharan's 'second' needs to be closely monitored, as his action during the match would continue to deteriorate
 Looks isse pehle usee saal lords main coudre vyakhyayan ke dauraan martin kro ne maang kii thi ki throwing ke sambandh main 15 degree ke bajaae bilkul bhi shunya sahishnutaa rakhi jaani chahie or unhone khaskar muthaiya muralidharan ko ek chakar qaraar diya
 In response to Crowe's criticism, ICC General Manager Dave Richardson said that the scientific evidence presented in this case by biomedical professors Bruce Elliott, Doctor Paul Hurian and Mr Mark Portswid was amazing and clarified that "some bowlers, even That those who are not suspected of bad action, they are also likely to have an arm 11 or 12 degrees straight
 iske saath hi kuch gendbaaj jinhen dekhne se lagata he ki wo thro kar rahe hai, ve ati-vistaarit yaa sthaayee taur par mudi hui kohni se hi gendbaaji karne lagenge
 niyamon kii sakht vyakhya ke tahat ve niyamon ko tod rahe hai – lekin agar ham aisa karne vaale sabhi gendbaajon ko hataa den to phir gendbaaji ke liye ek bhi gendbaaj nahin bachegaa"
 Since 1999, Muralitharan's discussion of bowling action has been published, as well as many scientific research on the need to legally define bowling action using bio-mechanistic concepts
 inhen shodhon ne isisi kii ore se muralidharan kii gendbaaji ke ection ko aadhikarik taur par sweekaar karne main sidhe taur par madad kii he or isisi ko is baat ke liye bhi manaaya ki wo cricket main gendbaaji ke ection ke niyam ko dobaaraa se paribhaashit kare

 The earliest example of crypto-christianity is found in Roman society when Christianity set its feet in Rome in the early days
 tatkaal mahaan roman samraat trojan ne isaiyat ko roman samskruti ke liye khatra samajha or jitne roman isai bane the unke saamne prastaav rakhaa ki yaa to ve isaiyat choden yaa mrityu-dand bhugten
 Roman Christians pretended to abandon Christianity to avoid capital punishment and then continued to worship Roman goddesses from above, but believed Christianity from within

 Environmental policy is a segment of environmental philosophy that extends beyond the limits of human ethics to the realm of human beings and includes other animals
 iskaa prabhaav anya vishyon jaise bhugol or paristhitiki, arthshaastra, dharamshastra, samajashaastra kanoon, ityadi vishyon par bhi padataa he
 We make many ethical decisions related to the environment
 udhaaharan ke liye: The theoretical field of environmental values started as a response to the work of scientists like Rachel Carson and resulted in events such as the first Earth Day in 1970
 On these occasions, scientists urged philosophers to consider philosophical aspects of environmental problems
 
 Two scientific articles, Lynn White's, "the Historical Roots of Our Ecological Crisis" and Garret Hardin's "the Tragedy of Cunning's", had a major impact
 Additionally, Garrett Hardin's later published article "exploring New Ethics for Survival", and "the Land Ethic", an essay by Aldo Leopold's book a Sand Country Allmanac, made a big impact
 In this essay, Leopold explicitly asserted this claim
 The roots of the ecological crisis were philosophical

 The Trumpeter: Journal of Ecosophy The first British journal of this type, Environmental Values, launched in 1992
 kai vidwaanon ne paryaavaran ko sammanit karne vaale vividh tareeko ko vargeekrut karne kii koshish kii he
 According to Peter Vardy's Puzzle of Ethics, Alan Marshall and Michael Smith are two recent examples
 marshall ke anusaar, teen saamaanya naitik drushtikon pichley 40 varshon main ubhare he
 Marshall uses the following words to describe them, libertarian extension, ecological extension and conservation ethics
 
 Marshall's libertarian extension includes a civil liberties approach
 In environmentalism, however, community generally refers to both humans and other animals
 andrew brennan paristhitik maanavtawaad ke pakshdhar hai or unka yah tark he ki sabhi antlajical sansthaaon, achetan or chetan ko, vishuddh rup se naitik mulya diya ja saktaa he kyonki unka astitv hai
 The work of Arnie Nayes and his associate Sessions also comes under libertarian expansion, but they like to call it "deep ecology"
 peter singer ke kaam ko marshall ke 'muktivaadee ekstansion ' ke antargat vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 He explained that the "expanded circle of moral value" should be re-created and included animal rights as well, and if it is not done then non-doers will be guilty of racism
 Singer did not accept the fact that unconscious goods also have intrinsic value, and in his book "practical Ethics" he concluded that unconscious objects should not be included in the expanding circle of moral values
 This approach is definitely organism focused
 haalanki nais or seshans ke kaary ke baad,"practical athiks" ke ek baad ke sanskaran main unhone yah sweekaara he ki, haalaanki ve gahan paristhitiki ke vichaar se asahmat hai, parantu gaiyr samvedansheel sansthaaon ke aantarik mulya kaa tark sambhav he lekin phir bhi sandigdh he
 We shall see later that Singer actually advocated a humanitarian policy
 alan marshall ke muktivaadee vistaar kii shrenee naa sirf maanav adhikaron par bal detii he balki sabhi jaivik sansthaaon or unke aavashyak vividhta ke buniyadi anyonyashray kii manyata par bal detii he
 While we can consider libertarian expansion as part of the political reflection of the natural world, we can consider ecological expansion as a scientific reflection of the natural world
 paristhitik vistaar mote rup se smith ke eco-holism ke samaan hi he, or iskaa tark yah he ki yah paristhitik tantra athwa vaishvik paryaavaran main anternihit mulya ke liye ve mahatvapurn hai
 Holmes Rolston, like other scholars, has also adopted this view
 is shrenee main james lavalock kii gia pariklpana bhi shaamil he jiske anusaar prithvi samay samay par apni shaareerik sanrachana badalati rahati he taaki jaivik or ajaivik padaarthon main santulan bana rahe
 prithvi ko ekikrut, sampurna santhaan mana gaya he jis par lambe samay main manushya jaati kaa koi mahatv nahin hoga
 Marshall's category of 'conservation ethics' is an extension of the value used in the non-human biological world
 yah paryaavaran kaa mahatv manushya ke liye upyogita ke sandarbh main hi dekhtaa he
 It opposes the intrinsic value of deep ecology and hence it has been called 'shallow ecology'
 yah siddhant maanata he ki paryaavaran kaa sangrakshan kiya janaa chahie kyunki iskaa bahya mulya he - jo qi manushya jati ke kalyaan ke liye he
 Protection is therefore a medium for a goal and is purely for the benefit of mankind and the generations to come
 yah kaha ja saktaa ki yahi vah tark tha jo sarkaron ne 1997 main kioto sammelan main prastaavit kiya or jis par ve teen samjhaute aadhaarit the jo 1992 main rio main liye gaye
 Keeping in mind the differences between bio-centric and eco-holist theories, Michael Smith classifies humanist theories as principles that must meet certain certain criteria for their moral standard and moral importance, such as condescension
 
 This also applies to the work of Peter Singer, who spoke of a sequence of values
 This sequence resembles Aristotle's work based on the ability to reason
 jab ham achetan vastuon jaise bageeche kii ghaas ke hit nirdhaarit karne kii baat karte hai tab jo samasya aati he yah uske liye singer ke dwaara sujhaayaa gaya samaadhaan tha
 Singer also spoke of the preservation of "world Heritage Sites", these are the parts of the world that have not deteriorated yet and which become "valuable due to diminishing" as they will slowly deteriorate over time
 
 This protected portion is our will for future generations, just as we inherited it from our ancestors
 ab yah in aane vaali pidiyon ko tay karnaa hoga kii ve in svachh evam apradooshit gramin kshetron kaa anand lenaa chaahate hai yaa sirf shahari paridrishy tak swayan ko simit karnaa chaahate hai
 a good example of a World Heritage Site are tropical abundant rain forests, this is a very special ecosystem or climatic climatic vegetation area that has taken several centuries to develop
 mitti kii sthiti ke kaaran kheti ke liye prachur varsha van kaa kaatna aksar vifal rahata he or ek baar chhedane ke baad, ise punerjeevit karne main hajaaron saal lag jate hai
 Human centricism places only humans at the center of the universe, according to this idea, mankind should always think about itself
 Whenever you have to think about the environmental values of a situation, then it has become customary in the western tradition to think only about the human species
 isliye jis bhi vastu kaa astitv he uskaa moolyankan manushya jati ke upyog ke sandarbh main hi kiya janaa chahie, or aisa kar ke ham naslwad ko badhaava dete hai
 All environmental studies should assess the intrinsic values of non-human beings
 In fact, based on this assumption, recently, a philosophical article attempted to explore the possibility of humans being extinct for other creatures happily
 is
 lekhakon ne is vichaar ko manan prayog kii sangya di he or yah bhi kaha he ki iskaa aashay yah nahin he ki is vichaar par kaary kiya jaae
 Anthropological theories do not allow that morality framed from the perspective of humans can be wrong, it is not necessary to believe that mankind is the greatest truth of this world
 darshanik barook spinoja kaa tark he ki ham chizon ko galat tareeke se unki hamaare liye upyogita ke sandarbh main moolyankan karte hai
 Spinoza explained that if we look at things in neutral terms, we will find that every object in the universe has its own unique value
 isi tarah, yah sambhav he ki ek maanav kendrit yaa anthropocentric / androcentric naitikta vaastaviktaa main sachai kaa sateek chithran nahin ho, or ek badi tasviir bhi sambhav he jise ham ek maanav drushtikon se samajhane main sakasham nahin he
 Peter Vardy distinguished two types of anthropomorphism
 ek shashakt anthropocentric naitik thisis kaa tark he ki insaan vaastaviktaa ke centre main rahe hai or yah unke liye sahi bhi he
 Weak anthropomorphism, however, argues that reality should only be seen from the human point of view, that humans should be at the center of the way they see reality
 is mudde par ek or nazariyaa bryan norton kaa he, inhone paryaavarniya yatharthwaad, kaa pratipaadan kiya
 This environmental realism has now become a core ideology in the region
 paryaavarniya yatharthwaad ne anthropocentrist naitikta or non anthropocentrist naitikta ke samarthakon ke bich ke vivaad par apana drushtikon banane se manaa kar diya
 iske bajaay, norton shashakt maanavkendravaad or kamjor yaa vistaarit maanavkendravaad ke bich bhed karnaa pasand karte hai or unhone yah vichaar pratipaadit kiya kii sirf kamjor yaa vistaarit maanavkendravaad hi praakrit vastuon se unka mulya nikaalane main manushya kii jo kshamta he, use kam aank saktaa he
 Environmental ethics became a subject of continuing academic philosophical thought in the 1970s
 1980 ke dashak main yah darshan shaastra kaa hissaa ban kar rahaa, or is vishay par sampoorn duniya ke bahut kam vichaarkon kaa dhyaan gaya
 Only after 1990 did such programs gain institutional recognition at places such as Colorado State, the University of Montana, Bowling Green State, and the University of North Texas
 In 1991, Schumacher College, Dartington, England was established, and now offers an msc in Holistic Sciences
