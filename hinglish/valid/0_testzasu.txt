 jo purv main bihar se pashchim main haryana-rajasthan tak or uttar main nepal-uttarapradesh se dakshin main madhyapradesh tak boli jaati thi
 Lord Buddha also continued to explain the religion to the people while going around in these regions
 aaj inhi pradeshon main hindi boli jaati he
 Therefore, Pali is ancient Hindi
 yah hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar main kii ek boli yaa praakrit he
 It is also known as the language of Buddhist Tripitaka
 paali, brahmi parivaar kii lipiyon main likhi jaati thi
 Regarding the etymology of the word Pali, there are many opinions of scholars
 kisi ne ise paath shabd se tathaa kisi ne pid se utpann karne kaa praytn kiya he
 Max Valeser, a German scholar, has expressed the opinion that he refers to the ancient language of Pataliputra by referring to Pali as an abbreviation for 'patali'
 in vyutpattiyon kii apeksha jin do maton kii ore vidwaanon kaa adhik jhukaav he, unamem se ek to he pan vidhushekhar bhattacharya kaa mat, jiske anusaar pali, pankti shabd se vyutpann hua he
 This view is strongly supported by an ancient Pali dictionary, Abhidhanappadipika, because in these words Tanti, Buddhism, Panthi and Pali, Pali also clearly means the line
 purvokt do arthon main pali ke jo prayog milte hai, unki bhi is arth se sarthakata siddh ho jaati he
 The meaning of the line of Buddhavachana or the line of the text sits in the experiments of Buddhaghosha
 tathaapi dhvanivigyaan ke anusaar pankti shabd se pali kii vyutpatti nahin baithai ja sakati
 It seems more appropriate to relate the word to the word Pali, Paththa, Padu, which is prevalent in the meaning of the line
 pali shabd peeche sanskrit main bhi prachlit hua paaya jaataa he
 The derivation of Pali in the Abhidhanappadipika, "paleti Rakhtati Pali", has been stated in this way also supports this view
 kintu "pali mahavyakaran" ke karta bhikshu jagadish kashyap ne pali ko pankti ke arth main lene ke vishay main kuch aapattiyaan uthaai hai or use mul tripitak granthon main anek sthanon par prayukt 'pariyay' shabd se vyutpann batalaane kaa praytn kiya he
 According to the Magadhi tendency in place of the word 'dhammapariya' of Tripitaka in the Bhabru inscription of Emperor Ashoka, the use of the word 'dhamma Paliyya' is found, which means Buddha-sermon or word
 kashyap ji ke anusaar isi paliyaay sharan se pali kii vyutpatti hui
 No name of the language is found anywhere in the original Tripitaka
 kintu buddhaghosh aadi aacharyon ne buddha ke upadeshon kii bhashaa ko magadhi kaha he
 In Visuddhimagga and Mahavansa this Magadhi has been called the root language of all beings
 uske sthaan par pali shabd kaa prayog praaia: 14veen shatee i
 ke purv nahin paaya jaataa
 Yes, Buddhaghosha has used the word Pali in his biographies, but not in the sense of language, but in the meaning of the text of Buddhavakha or Moolatripitaka and that too often to make that text look different from the story
 is prakaar kahin unhone kaha he ki isaki pali is prakaar he, kintu atthkatha main aisa he, athwa yah baat na pali main he or na atthkatha main ai he
 The word Pali is found to be used in these two meanings in some of the Deepavans written before the time of Buddhaghosh and also in the later works of Mahavans etc
 isi arthprayog se kramash: pali shabd us sahitya tathaa uski bhashaa ke liye bhi kiya jane laga
 In terms of language, Pali is a form of that medieval Indian Aryan language, whose development was around BC
 Considered from the sixth century
 usase purv kii adiugin bhartiya aryabhasha kaa swaroop vedon tathaa brahmanon, upanishdon evam ramayana, mahabharat aadi granthon main praapt hota he, jinhen 'vaidic bhashaa' evam 'sanskrit bhashaa' kehete hai
 The distinction of medieval languages is more prominent in the following things than Vedic language and Sanskrit: vyakaran kii drushti se These features are common features of the medieval Indian Aryan language and are found in the lingua franca of the country whose propagation lasted for some two thousand years from the said period and whose literature is also available
 ukt saamaanya lakshanon ke atirikt in bhashaaon main apane-apane desh or kaal kii apeksha naanaa bhed paae jate hai
 Their three levels are considered from the point of view of time - in sab yugon kii bhashaaon ko ek saamaanya naam praakrit diya gaya he
 Its first level is found in the form of languages in Ashoka's commendations and Pali literature
 dwitiya str kii bhashaaon main magadhi, ardhamagadhi, shauraseni evam maharashtri praakrit bhashaayen he jinka vipul sahitya uplabdh he
 The third level languages are named apabhransh and avahath
 deshbhed kii drushti se madhyakaalin bhashaaon ke bhed kaa sarvapracheen parichay maury samrat ashok kii dharmalipiyon main praapt hota he
 There are three distinct distinctions - Eastern, Western and Western
 purvi bhashaa kaa swaroop dhauli or jogarh kii prashastiyon main dikhaai detaa he
 In these, the inflection of the nominative singular of the words l and Shakanta is well established
 praakrit ke vaiyakarnon ne in pravritiyon ko magadhi praakrit ke vishesh lakshanon main ginaya he
 According to the grammaticalization, the third special feature of this Magadhi Prakrit is the use of Sh in place of the three hot colors
 kintu ashok ke ukt lekhon main yah pravriti nahin pai jaati, kyonki yahan teenon ooshmon ke sthaan par s hi prayukt hua he
 For this reason, it is more appropriate to call this eastern nature of Ashoka as Magadhi and not the ancient form of Ardhamagadhi
 pashchimi bhashaa bhed kaa pratinidhitiv karanevaalon main girnaar kii prashastiyaan hai
 Among them, the distinction between Su and l is safe
 ooshmon ke sthaan par s kaa prayog he tathaa acarant karta kaarak ekvachan rup o main ant hota he
 It is clear from these trends that this language is an ancient form of Shaurseni
 pashchimottar kii bhashaa kaa rup shahbajgadhi or mansera kii prashastiyon main dikhaai detaa he
 Often, these three hot colors are safe in their place
 kahin-kahin kuch vyatyay drushtigochar hota he
 Rakarayukta samyavarna also appears, and the use of Ranj is found in place of Jya and Nyya
 ye pravritiyaan us bhashaa ko pashachi praakrit kaa purv rup ingit karti hai
 Some part of Pali Tripitaka must have assumed literary form during the time of Ashoka as seven episodes of his Lahuloism, Monayyasutt etc
 are mentioned in his praise of Bhabru
 kintu uplabdh sahitya kii bhashaa main ashok ke purvi shilaalekh kii bhashaa sambandhi visheshtaon kaa praaia: sarvatha abhaav he
 Broadly, the form of Pali language most closely matches the language of the Girnar commendation, and for this reason Pali is not primarily east, but central
 jis visheshta ke kaaran pali madhyayugin bhartiya aryabhasha ke pratham str kii gini jaati he, dwitiya kii nahin, vah he usamen madhyavarti aghosh vyanjanon ke lop tathaa mahapraan varnon ke sthaan par h ke aadesh kaa abhaav
 These trends are common features of second-level languages
 haan, kahin kahin k t jaise aghosh varnon ke sthaan par g d aadi saghosh varnon kaa aadesh dikhaai detaa he
 But this one is only in a small quantity and the other is indicative of the relatively later trend within the said dignity of the first level
 pali bhashaa evam madhyakaalin bhartiya aryabhashaon ke sambandh main dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki yah bhashavikas jo sanskrit se mana jaataa he vah thik nahin
 In fact, since the Vedic period, the lingua franca, along with the literary language, has taken the form of literary natural languages according to the country and time
 pali bhi apni puri viraasat sanskrit se nahin le rahi, kyonki usamen anke shabdarup aise paae jate hai jiskaa mail sanskrit se nahin, kintu vedon kii bhashaa se baithta he
 For example, in Pali and other Prakrit, forms like Deverbhi, Devehi, of Tritiya plural are found
 acarant sangyaaon ke aise roopon kaa sanskrit main sarvatha abhaav he, kintu vaidic main deverbhi, utana hi suprachilit he jitna devai:
 Therefore, the tradition of the above form can be considered as originating from the Vedic language in Pali and Prakrit
 usee prakaar pali main 'yamamase', 'maasre', 'kaatve' aadi anek rup aise hai jinke pratyay sanskrit main paae hi nahin jate, kintu vaidic bhashaa main vidyaman hai
 Literature written in Prakrit is not available before Pali texts and Ashoka's commendations and Prakrit grammars have done grammatical analysis of Prakrit language by considering Sanskrit as Prakriti for their convenience and hence the confusion has arisen that Prakrit languages originated in Sanskrit
 resulted from
 pali ke kacchan, moggallan aadi vyakaranon main yah dosha nahin paaya jaataa, kyonki vahaan bhashaa kaa varnan sanskrit ko prakruti maanak nahin kiya gaya
 Pali words are given below like some key words
 shabdkosh : Text: pali adhyayan : Discussion Group: pali saftware evam upkaran : Maharani Ahilyabai was the wife of Khanderao, son of history-famous Subedar Malharrao Holkar
 janm inkaa san 1725 main hua tha or dehanth 13 agast 1795 ko; tithi us din bhadrapada krishna chaturdashi thi
 Ahilyabai was not the queen of a very heavy kingdom
 unka kaaryakshetra apekshaakrit simit tha
 Yet what he did, surprises him
 das-baarah varsh kii aayu main unka vivaah hua
 She was widowed at the age of twenty nine
 pati kaa swabhaav chanchal or ugr tha
 They tolerated all this
 phir jab bayalis-taintalis varsh kii thim, putr malerao kaa dehanth ho gaya
 When Ahilyabai was about sixty-two years old, Dauhitra Nathu passed away
 chaar varsh peeche damaad yashwantrao phanse na rahaa or inaki putree muktabai sati ho gai
 He had affection for Malharrao, the son of a distant relative Tukojirao; She used to think that in future it will handle the doors of governance, system, justice and prajaranjan; But he kept grieving them till the end
 ahilyabai ne apane rajya kii simaaon ke baahar bharat-bhar ke prasiddh tirthon or sthanon main mandir banawaye, ghat bandhwaae, kuon or baavadiyon kaa nirmaan kiya, maarg banawaye-sudharwaaye, bhukhon ke liye annsatr khole, pyaason ke liye pyau bithlaayin, mandiron main vidwaanon kii niyukti shastron ke manan-chintan or pravachan hetu kii
 And, by sacrificing the false temptation of self-respect, always tried to do justice - till death
 ye usee parampara main thim jisamen unke samakaleen puna ke nyaayadhish ramshastri the or unke peeche jhansi kii rani lakshmibai hui
 It was during her lifetime that the public began to understand and say 'devi'
 itnaa bada vyaktitv janata ne apni aankhon dekha hi kahan tha
 When there was a mess around
 shashan or vyavastha ke naam par ghor atyaachaar ho rahe the
 People - ordinary householders, peasants, laborers - were sobbing in a very inferior state
 unka ekmaatr sahaara-dharm-andhvishwaason, bhay traason or rudhiyon kii jakad main ksaa ja rahaa tha
 There was neither power nor faith in justice
 aise kaal kii un vikat paristhitiyon main ahilyabai ne jo kuch kiya-or bahut kiya
 - She is memorable
 indore main prati varsh bhadrapada krishna chaturdashi ke din ahilyotsav hota chalaa aata he
 There is a difference of opinion regarding the importance of their temple building and other religious functions
 in kaaryon main ahilyabai ne andhadhundh kharch kiya or sena nae dhang par sangathit nahin kii
 Tukoji Holkar's army had to bear the brunt of the Northern Expeditions, sometimes it is alleged that these temples have been told the outposts of Hinduism
 tukojirao holkar ke paas baarah lakh rupye the jab vah ahilyabai se rupye kii maang par maang kar rahaa tha or sansar ko dikhalaataa tha ki rupye-paise se tang hoon
 Then what was the fault of Ahilyabai? The spirit of religion has been the biggest driving force for Hindus; Ahilyabai used the same
 tatkaaleen andhvishwaason or rudhiyon kaa varnan upanyaas main aayaa he
 One of these beliefs was to jump from a hill in the Narmada arrow near Mandhata and commit suicide to attain salvation
 ahilyabai ke sambandh main do prakaar kii vichaardhaaraen rahi hai
 In one, she has been given the title of incarnation of Goddess, in the second she has shown reverence for superstitions and stereotypes along with her superlative qualities
 vah andhere main prakaash-kiran ke samaan thim, jise andheraa baar-baar grasane kii cheshtaa karata rahaa
 Due to her excellent ideas and ethical conduct, she got the status of Goddess in the society
 malharav ke bhai-bandon main tukojirao holkar ek vishwaasapaatr yuvak the
 Malharrao had also kept him with him forever and got ready for the reign
 ahilyabai ne inhen apana senapati banaaya or chouth vasuul karne kaa kaam unhen saunp diya
 Though Tukojirao Holkar was older than Ahilyabai at the age, but Tukoji considered her as his mother and used to do the work of the state with full devotion and truth
 ahilyabai kaa un par itnaa prem or vishwaas tha ki vah bhi unhen putr jaisaa maanati thim
 'khandoji Sut Tukoji Holkar' is said in the state papers wherever they are mentioned and also in the seals
 rajya kii chintaa kaa bhaar or us par praanon se bhi pyaare logon kaa viyog
 Ahilyabai's body could not handle all this grief
 or 13 agast san 1795 ko unki jivan-lila samaapt ho gai
 After Ahilyabai's death, Tukoji ascended the throne of Indore

 The main source of the receipt of slaves was the captives received in war, but also the slaves were received by parents from child molestation, kidnapping and purchasing from organized slave markets

 Around 1510, when the first ship laden with African Habshi slaves reached the New World, there was a new turning point in the history of slavery

 These new Habshi slaves were more obedient and hard-wired than the indigenous slaves, which was the main reason for these Habsis to cross the seven seas away from their African homeland

 Slave labor in sugarcane, cotton fields and mines became even more useful than before
 falat: habshiyon kaa aayaat itnaa badha ki sheeghra hi pashchimi dweepasmoohon main unka bahumat ho gaya
 Under the aegis of greedy European powers, there was such fierce competition among the private companies of slave trading that by the early 18th century the Habshi slave trade reached its culmination

 In fact slavery is a major basis of England, America and European capitalism

 These slaves also had to accept the language and religion of their various European masters as they could only get opportunities to keep their cultural heritage alive in that hell

 In the 18th century in the United States, when there was some possibility of rebellions of the Habshi, it was legally forbidden for the Habsis to carry weapons, drum drums and take to the streets at night

 He is believed to have died in 1628 in Vrindavan
 yah bhi bataaya jaataa he ki raskhaan ne bhagwat kaa anuwaad farsi or hindi main kiya he
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding the birth of Rasakhan
 anek vidwaanon ne inkaa janm sanwat 1615 i
 mana he or kuch ne 1630 i
 mana he
 According to Raskhan, Delhi had become a crematorium due to mutiny, then he left Delhi and went to Braj
 aitihaasik sakshya ke aadhaar par pataa chalata he ki uparyukt gadar san 1613 i
 main hua tha
 It seems from his talk that he was an adult at that time
 raskhaan kaa janm sanwat 1590 i
 maananaa adhik samichin prathit hota he
 Bhavani Shankar Yagnik believes the same
 anek tathyon ke aadhaar par unhone apane mat kii pushti bhi kii he
 The same fact comes out on the basis of historical texts
 yah maananaa adhik prabhaavshaalee prathit hota he ki raskhaan kaa janm san 1590 i
 main hua tha
 There are many differences regarding the place of birth of Raskhan
 kai vidwaan unka janm sthal pihaani athwa dilli ko maanate he
 Based on the first history and historical facts of Shiv Singh Saroj and Hindi literature, the birth place of Rasakhan should be considered as Pihani district Hardoi
 raskhaan arthath ras ke khan, parantu unka asli naam saiyad ibrahim tha or unhone apana naam keval is kaaran rakhaa taaki ve iskaa prayog apni rachanaaon par kar saken
 Rasakhan was a great poet
 unki adhikansh rachanaayen bhagwaan krishna ko samarpit hai
 In the following Savaiya, Rasakhan has wished to be born around Braj for the next life- input vidhi ko input methd yaa input methd auditor bhi kaha jaataa he
 In the context of computers and other digital devices, the input method or input method is a program that is a part of the operating system and also helps to write characters and signals that are not available on the keyboard of the computer

 doosraa cricket ke khel main of spin gendbaaj dwaara daali jane vaali ek vishesh prakaar kii gend he, jise pakistani cricket khilaadi sakalan mushtak dwaara lokapriy banaaya gaya tha
 This word in Urdu means "the other one"
 Saqlain Mushtaq has also discovered a new version of the second, which he calls "third", which means "third one"
 anya gendbaajon ne antarrashtriya cricket main doosraa kaa kaaphi istemaal kiya he; iname shaamil hai, srilanka ke muthaiya muralidharan or ajanta mendis, dakshin africa ke johaan botha, bharat ke harbhajan singh or pakistan ke shoeb malik tathaa said ajmal
 The second is a relatively new type of bowling
 sakalan mushtak ko isaki khoj kaa shrey diya jaataa he; isane unki safalataa tathaa spin gendbaaji ke bhavishya main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he, kyonki is baat kii sambhaavna kaaphi kam he ki unke pehle kisi bhi of-spin gendbaaj dwaara leg said se ghoomane vaali gend kaa istemaal kiya gaya hoga
 The naming of this ball is credited to former Pakistan wicketkeeper Moin Khan, who used to put Mushtaq "second" from behind the wicket
 in maichon main se ek main camentry karne vaale tony greg antat is shabd ko us gend ke saath jodne main safal rahe or match pashchaat ke ek saakshaatkaar main sakalan dwaara isaki pushti bhi kar di gayi
 Thus the term became a part of cricket culture
 doosraa ab spin gendbaaji kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa ban chukaa he
 However, according to some, the second start was made by Sauni Ramadin, who played for the West Indies in the 1950s, as he used to spin the ball on both sides and put the other despite catching the ball like an off-break bowler
 Like many off-break bowlers, his bowling action was questionable
 gendbaaj ek saamaanya of brake ke ungliyon ke ection ke samaan hi gend ko daalata he, lekin apni kalai ko thodaa adhik ghuma letaa he taaki haath ke peeche kaa hissaa ballebaaj ke saamne rahe
 When doing so, the ball starts moving in the reverse direction of a normal off break and spins from the leg side to the off side for a right-handed batsman

 a left-handed bowler can also bowl another, which will move from off to leg
 Sri Lankan left-arm bowler Rangan Herath was recognized for bowling a similar ball, especially against Australia during an a Tour
 England's left-arm bowler Monty Panesar claims that he has been bowling this type of ball occasionally in domestic matches
 aisa lagata he ki kai anya of spinner "doosraa" kaa adhikadhik upyog karne kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Interestingly, apart from Saqlain Mushtaq himself, all other off-spinners who have used this ball have been accused of throwing, though in most cases it has been dismissed

 In another method used by former Warwickshire bowler Alex Loudon, the middle finger is 'flicked' while putting the ball behind the ball, causing the ball to move from leg to off

 Muralitharan's second, while bowling during the Sri Lanka tour of Australia in 2004, became the subject of an official report by match referee Chris Broad to illegally straighten the arm above the elbow
 baad main perth sthit university of western australia main kiye gaye biomecanical pareekshanon main paaya gaya ki muralidharan doosraa daalate samay apni baanh ko 10 degree tak sidhaa karte the, jo ki international cricket council dwaara spin gendbaajon ke liye sweekrut 5 degree se kaaphi adhik tha
 Muralitharan was later instructed by Sri Lanka Cricket not to use another in international cricket
 november 2004 main, antarrashtriya cricket parishad ne avaidh gendbaaji ection ke kshetra main or adhik anusandhan kiye or paaya ki kai gendbaaj jinke ection ko vaid mana ja rahaa tha, vastav main niyamon kaa atikaraman kar rahe the
 In early 2005, a rule change was proposed and accepted at a meeting of ICC ceos stating that any bowler could straighten his arm by 15 degrees and thus Muralitharan's second was again a valid ball
 It has become

 Was made yah bataaya gaya ki unki baanh 10 degree ke kone tak sidhi hoti he jab ki isisi ke maanak 5 degree tak ko hi sweekaar karte he
 a complaint was also made against Pakistani all-rounder Shoaib Malik after the first Test played between Pakistan and Australia in December 2004
 muralidharan ke samaan, un par bhi biomecanical pareekshan kiye gaye or us shrinkhalaa ke baaki teston main unhone gendbaaji nahin kii
 Unlike other cricketers who are accused of throwing while bowling their second ball, Malik is also a capable batsman and some analysts believe that he will start focusing more on his batting when he is stopped from bowling
 Malik was dropped from the Pakistan team for the first Test against Australia in 2004, although this was not due to any controversy but because of the Perth pitch being unfavorable to spin bowlers
 malik ne may 2005 main kuch sudhaar karne ke baad punah gendbaaji shuru kar di
 After the first Test in Multan in November 2005 against England, a complaint was again made against him and Ahmed Shabbir

 baad main unki gendbaaji ko avaidh qaraar de diya gaya or un par pratibandh laga diya gaya, haalanki is pratibandh ko november 2006, main samaapt kar diya gaya
 However, he was called back again in April 2009 to re-evaluate his bowling action following the Australia series
 may 2009 main unhen doosraa ke atirikt anya sabhi prakaar kii gendon ko daalane kii anumati de di gayi kyonki unki doosraa ko 15 degree kii seemaa ke paar mana gaya tha
 At the spin summit held at Cricket Australia's Center for Excellence in July 2009, it was decided that young spinners would not be taught the second ball
 The meeting included the following representatives, former Test spinners Shane Warne, Stuart mcgill, Jim Higgs, Gavin Robertson, Terry Jenner, Peter Philpott and Ashley Mallett
 According to him, the second one cannot be put in a legitimate way and it will not be taught in Australia until the ICC decides to legalize all forms of chucking

 Elephants are one of the most intelligent species in the world
 5 kilogram se adhik vazan kaa hathi kaa mastishk kisi bhi sthaliy jaanavar kii tulana main bada hota he
 Although the body size of a whale of the largest size is 20 times that of a typical elephant, the whale's brain weighs twice that of an elephant's brain

 Aristotle once said that elephants are "animals that leave all other animals behind in terms of mind and intellect"
 hathi main ek bahut badi or atyadhik valani niocortex hoti he, yahi visheshta manushya, vanar or dolphin kii vishisht prajatiyon main bhi pai jaati he
 Scientists consider it a sign of complex intelligence
 yah ek janaa mana tathy he, isamen kam se kam ek apwaad he: ekidna kaa mastishk atyadhik viksit hota he, phir bhi use hoshiyaar nahin mana jaataa
asian hathi ke cerebral cortex kaa aaytan sabase adhik hota he, jo sabhi maujuuda sthaliy jaanwaron main ek sangyanatmak visheshta he
 The volume of the cerebral cortex of elephants is available for cognitive processing, which is higher than that of any other primate species, and extensive studies place elephants in the category of great apes in terms of cognitive ability to use devices and build devices
 Huh
 hathi kaa mastishk adhik jatil gairal praturup ko darshata he tathaa isamen manushya, primets yaa maansaahaari jaanwaron kii tulana main adhik or asankhya valan hote hai, lekin yah ketasian se kam jatil hota he
 However, the vulcanum of the elephant's brain is "thicker than that of the cetacean" and is believed to contain as many vulcitic neurons and vulcine synapses as in humans, which is higher than that of the cetacean
 :71 kisi samasya kaa samaadhaan karne kii kshamta ke sandarbh main hathi ko dolphin ke samatuly mana jaataa he, or kai vaigyanik hathi kii hoshiyaari ko ketasian ke samaan str par rakhte hai; vastav main, abisi science ke dwaara prakashit 2011 ke ek lekh ke anusaar, "hathi smart hote hai jitne ke chimp dolphin"
 The elephant also has an extremely large and highly convex hippocampus, a brain structure found in the limbic system that is larger than any human, primate or cetacean
 ek hathi kaa hippocampus, mastishk kii kendriya saranchana kaa lagbhag 0

 Like humans, elephants learn to grow up
 jab ve janm lete hai, us samay unhen is baat kaa gyaan nahin hota ki unhen duniya main kaise jivit rahanaa he
 Elephants have a lot of time to learn in life, this period is around 10 years

 At birth, a human's brain weighs 28 percent of an adult's brain, 42

 It should be noted that the instinct is quite different from the intelligence learned

 The similarity between elephant's brain and man's brain supports the thesis of convergent development
 :154 Elephants are one of the societies of living species that are closely related to each other
 hathi ke parivaar ke sadsy keval maut ke kaaran hi ek duusare se alag hote hai, yaa unke kisi sadsy ko bandhak bana kar hi unhen alag kiya ja saktaa he
 Cynthia Mose, specializing in elephants, studied a family of African elephants
 parivaar ke do sadasyon par shikariyon ne goli chalaai, baad main bache hue haathiyon ne inkaa peechha kiya
 Although one elephant died, the other, an elephant named Tina, stood still, but her knees were responding
 parivaar ke do sadsy trista or terresia, tina ke donon or khadey ho gaye, unhone jhuk kar use khadey hone madad kii
 In the end, Tina became so weak that she fell to the ground and died
 haalanki, trista or terresia ne haar nahin maani, ve use uthaane kii koshish karte rahe
 He somehow made Tina sit, but her body was lifeless, she again fell to the ground
 tabhi parivaar ke anya sadsy bhi madad ke liye aa gaye, unhone tina ke munh main ghaas daalane kii koshish kii
 Teresia then placed her teeth under Tina's head next and tried to lift her
 jaise hi usne aisa kiya, uskaa daayan daant puri tarah se tut gaya, hoth or tantrika guha se baahar aa gaya
 The elephants stopped trying to pick him up but they did not leave him, instead, they started burying him in a shallow pit, putting leaves over his body
 ve puri raat vahin khadey rahe or subah vahaan se jane lage
 Terracea was added at the end
 hathi ek duusare se atyadhik nikatataa se jude hote hai, unamem matra-putr prem kii bhavanaaen hoti hai, kisi ek sadsy kii mrityu se unka parivaar tabah ho jaataa he, or kuch samooh to kabhi bhi apane samooh ko phir se nahin bana pate
 sinthia mos ne ek maa ke bachche kii mrityu ke baad uskaa prekshan kiya, vah kai dinon tak apane parivaar ke jhund main sabase peeche dhire dhire chalati thi
 Edward Topsell, in his book The History of for-footed Beasts in 1658, stated, "there is no animal in the world that can display so much ability and power, and so much intelligence, other than elephants
" isi prakaashan main unhone kaha ki hathi suraj or chandramaa kii puja karte hai or ek vishesh prakaar kaa vishaiylla paudha chabane se garbhadhaaran kar lete hai, inamen se donon hi baaten sach nahin hai
 Elephants are compared to chimpanzees in terms of their cooperation skills
 hathi ko atyadhik paropkaaree jaanavar mana jaataa he, vah sankat ke samay main yahaan tak kii manushya sahit anya prajatiyon kii bhi madad karata he
 In India, an elephant helping people lifting wood was walking in the back of a truck and placing wood in pre-made holes at the behest of his mahout
 ek nishchit chhed main, hathi ne lakdi ko rakhane se manaa kar diya
 Mahavat came to see and saw a dog sleeping in that hole
 hathi ne lakdi ko chhed main tabhi utaara jab kutta chalaa gaya
 Cynthia Mose has often found that elephants often change their ways, thinking that there is no harm to humans, they even do so when they have difficulty doing so themselves
 jois pool ne kuki galmen kii likepia raanch main colin frencombe ke dwaara ek ghatana kaa vivaran diya
 a shepherd was going with his camels when he encountered a family of elephants
 metriark ne us par hamalaa kiy, uski ek taang tut gayi
 In the evening, when he did not return, some men were sent to the truck to find him
 jab vah mila ek hathi uski raksha kar rahaa tha
 The animal attacked the truck, so they shot at him and tried to scare him
 baad main gadhriye ne use bataaya ki jab vah khadaa nahin ho paa rahaa tha, tab hathi ne apni sound se use uthaaya or ek ped kii chaaya main baitha diya
 He protected her all day and lightly touched her with his trunk
 africa main hathi borginasi parivaar ke ek ped kii pattiyaan chaba kar apana ilaaj karte hai, jo prasav pidaa ko prerit karata he
 Kenyan elephants also used this tree for the same purpose
 homo sepian sepian or nienderthal ke alaava hathi dharti par par ek maatr prajati he jo mrityu ke samay par vishesh anushthan karti he
 They take great interest in the ashes of their loved ones
 It is often seen that they are comfortably removing bones from their trunk and legs and the other elephants are sitting in peace
 kabhi kabhi aise hathi bhi mritak kii kabr par aa jate hai, jinka usase koi sambandh nahin hota
 When an elephant gets hurt, other elephants help him
 hathi shodhakarta martin meredith ne apni pustak main ek hathi kii mrityu ke anushthan ke bare main likhaa, ek dakshin africa jeev vigyaani anthoni maaikel haul iskaa chashmadid tha, jisane eddo, dakshin africa main aath saal se zyada samay tak haathiyon par adhyayan kiya
 The entire family of the deceased, including his young child, was stroking his body with a trunk, trying to raise him
 haathiyon kaa jhund jor jor se awaajen laga rahaa tha
 His child was crying and his sorrowful screams could be heard, but then the whole group suddenly calmed down
 phir unhone uske sharir par mitti or pattiyaan daalani shuru kar deen, use dhakne ke liye ped kii tahaniyaan todin
 ve agle do din tak chupchaap uske sharir par khadey hokar vyateet karte hai kabhi kabhi ve bhojan aurapani kii talash main chale jate hai lekin hameshaa laut aate hai
 This type of behavior of elephants around humans is common throughout Africa
 kai avasaron par, unhone mrit manushyon ko bhi dafnaaya he yaa dukh main unki madad kii he
 Meredith recalls another incident told to him by George Adamson, a Kenyan game warden, an old Ottoman woman forgetting her way home, sleeping under a tree
 jab vah jaagi, ek hathi uske upar khadaa tha or use pyaar se sahala rahaa tha
 She stabilized, because she was very scared
 ek or hathi vahaan aayaa, unhone jor jor se chillanaa shuru kar diya or use shakhaon ke neeche dafna diya
 The next morning the local shepherds found him waving, he was not hurt
 jorge adamson ek or ghatana ko yaad karte hai jab unhone ek samooh main ek bul hathi kaa shikaar kiya jo uttari kenya ke sarkari bageeche main ghus gaya tha
 George gave elephant meat to the local Turk tribesmen and dragged the rest of the body for a mile
 us raat, anya haathiyon ko uskaa sharir mila, unhone uski kandhe kii blade or taang kii haddi lee, thik usee sthaan par chale gaye jahaan hathi ko maaraa gaya tha
 Scientists often argue that elephants feel emotions
 jois pool ne kai baar junglee africa haathiyon ko khelte hue dekha he
 They often do many things to entertain themselves and others
 aksar dekha gaya he ki hathi pani ko apni sound main khinch lete hai, phir apni sound ko hawa main laharaa kar fawwaare kii tarah pani ko spray karte hai
 Recent studies have shown that elephants can imitate the sounds they hear
 yah tab paaya gaya jab ek anaath hathi ne paas se guzarate hue trakon kii aawaaj kii nakal kii
 Animals that have been known to mimic sounds so far include whales, dolphins, bats, primates, and birds
 23 saal ke ek africa hathi kelimero ek vishesh prakaar kii nakal kaa pradarshan kiya
 He accompanied the Asian elephants to the Swiss Zoo
 asian hathi chirp kii dhwani karte hai jo africa haathiyon kii gahari rambling dhwani se alag he
 Calimero also began to chirp, not making the typical deep voice of his species
 dakshin korea ke everland amujament park main ek bhartiya hathi, kosik ne prashikshakon ko hairaan kar diya jab usne apane prashikshak jong gap kim kii aawaaj kii nakal kii
 Kosik can copy eight Korean words including sit, no, yes and lie down
 uski nakal bilkul manushya kii aawaaj lagati he
 Kosik puts his trunk in his mouth, then shakes it while exhaling and makes a human voice
 yah kuch is tarah se karata he jaise log apane munh main anguli rakh kar siti bajaate hai
 Elephants make sounds to keep in touch with each other when they cannot see each other
 maadaa hathi in awaajon ko yaad bhi rakh sakate hai, is tarah se ve apane parivaar ke sadasyon ko bahari sadasyon se vibhedit kar lete hai
 They also differentiate between family units on the basis of how often these voices were heard
 haathiyon main upkarnon kaa istemaal kerani kii ullekhneey kshamta hoti he, ve apni sound kaa upyog bhujaa kii tarah karte hai
 Elephants dug potholes to drink water, uprooted the bark of a tree, chewed it up into a ball shape, filled a hole, covered it with soil to prevent evaporation, later Come back here and drink water
 ve aksar makkhiyaan udaane ke liye yaa apane aap ko khujali karne ke liye tahaniyon kaa upyog karte hai
 Elephants fall on a very large rock after lightning, so that it is destroyed or electricity is cut off
 kai anya prajatiyon kii tarah, hathi apni sound se brush ko pakad kar kalakaari bhi karte hai
 An example of this is shown in a TV program Extraordinary Animals, in which the elephant was painting a flower in a camp in Thailand
 haalanki chitra haathiyon ne hi banaaye the, lekin ek vyakti hameshaa unki sahaayta kar rahaa tha or unka maargdarshan kar rahaa tha
 From these representations, it cannot be said with certainty whether elephants are conscious of the figure of their painting
 ek hathi kaa asaadhaaran video vruttchitr jisamen hathi ek hathi kii tasviir bana rahaa he-sambhavatya aatm jaagrukta ko pradarshit karata he- yah internet samachar or video websit par bahut prasidd ho gayi he
 The quality of the painting is very high, seeing this many viewers expressed doubts about the veracity of the video
 website snopes
com, jo shahari kivdantiyon main visheshgy he, vah video ko "sach" bataati he, jisamen hathi brush se stroke bana rahaa he, lekin dhyaan den ki bani hui painting kii samanta hathi ke rachanaatmak prayaas ke bajaay siikhe gaye strokes ko darshaati he
 Elephants can spend long time solving problems
 ve nayi chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye apane vyavhaar ko tadnusaar badal lete hai, yah ek jatil budhimatta kaa chinh he
 a 2010 experiment found that in order to get food, "elephants learn to help a partner in which two creatures are pulling two ends of the same rope to get the reward", their level of cooperation skills Are equivalent to chimpanzees in terms of
 1970 ke dashak main marine world africa, america main bandula naam kaa ek asian hathini rahati thi
 Bandula untied the shackles tied at her feet, or broke them
 sabase jatil upkaran tha brumal hook, yah upkaran tab band ho jaataa he jab do vipareet bindu ek saath khiskate hai
 Bandula slid the hook until these two points moved away from each other
 jab usne apane aap ko mukt kar liya vah duusare haathiyon ko bhi aaazaad karne main unki madad karne lagi
 In the case of Bandula and of course in the case of another hostage animal, the elephant also tries to cheat, as if he looks around to make sure no one sees him
 ek anya maamle main, ek maadaa hathi ne ek inch moti lohe kii chad ek ai hole kii madad se khol diya
 He used his trunk for this and untied the bolt
 phinics chidyaghar main ek asian hathini rubi aksar chhipakar apane rakhwale kii baaten sunati thi jab vah uske bare main baat karata tha
 She became very excited when she heard the word paint
 use haraa, pilaa, nila or laal rang pasand tha
 One particular day a truck arrived there, it was parked nearby, a man had a heart attack
 trek kii lit pile, laal or safed rangon main chamak rahi thi
 When Ruby later painted the same day, she chose these colors
 vah un rangon ko bhi praathamikta detii thi jo uske rakhwale ne pahane hote the
 Harry Peachey, an elephant trainer, developed a collaborative relationship with the cocoa salt elephant
 cocao apane prashikshak kii madad karti thi, uske rakhwale kai cmand dekar use protsaahit karte the or cocao kai shabd sikh gayi
 Peache said that elephants often start to cooperate in human work, if a sense of respect and sensitivity is kept towards them
 Coco worked at a time when the keeper needed "elephant help"
 ek baar ve maadaa haathiyon ke ek samooh ko kisi or chidyaghar main sthanantarit kar rahe the
 When keepers wanted to transfer a female, they usually used the word transfer after her name
 Coco soon understood its meaning
 agar rakhwale hathi ke sthantharan kii baat karte the to ve hilanaa band kar dete the, tab ve kehete the, "cocao mujhe haath do
" cocao yah sunakar madad karti thi
 After working with elephants for 27 years, Peachey strongly believes that he can understand the words and syntax of some words
 yah jantu varg main bahut hi durlabh lakshan he
 a study by Dr
 Naoko Iri of the University of Tokyo found that elephants also demonstrate skills in arithmetic
 prayog main "uno chidyaghar ke haathiyon ke saamne do tokariyon main alag alag sankhya ke seb daale gaye or yah darj diya gaya ki kitni baar hathi ne zyada falon vaali tokari ko uthaaya
" jab tokari main ek se zyada seb daale gaye, to iskaa arth yah tha ki "hathi ko is gananaa ke kul yoga ko apane dimag main rakhana hota tha"
 parinaam darshaate hai ki "74 pratishat baar jaanavar ne puri bhari sahi tokari ko hi uthaaya
 eshy namak ek africa hathi 87 pratishat kaa sabase zyada score banaaya

 " is adhyayan kii sateekta ko pramanit karne ke liye ise filmaaya bhi gaya tha
 Asiatic elephants have joined a small group of animals, including the great apes, bottlenose dolphins, magpie, which display self-awareness
 adhyayan kaa sanchaalan neuyork main bronks chidyaghar main haathiyon kaa upyog karte hue vanyajeev sangrakshan sosayadi ke saath kiya gaya
 Although many animals respond to mirrors, very few show evidence that they recognize that they are seeing themselves in the mirror
 adhyayan main paaya gaya ki asian hathi bhi isi prakaar ke vyavhaar kaa pradarshan karte hai jab ve 2
5 m-by-2
5 m ke darpan ke saamne khadey hote hai- ve aaine ke saamne khadey hote hai or khaane ke liye apane bhojan ko bhi darpan ke paas le aate hai
 Evidence of the elephant's self-awareness was found when Elephant Happy repeatedly touched the painted x on his head with his trunk, a mark that could only be seen in the mirror
 happy ne rangahin paint se banaaye gaye ek or nishaan par dhyaan nahin diya, yah nishaan bhi uske maathe par hi banaaya gaya tha, taaki yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ke vah paint kii gandh ke liye to pratikriya nahin kar rahi he
 France de Waal, who conducted the study, stated, "these similarities between man and elephant suggest that a convergent cognitive development is possibly related to complex societies and cooperation
 " Joyce Pool of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project, Kenya, has shown that elephants mimic sounds produced in the environment and by each other and literally try to learn them

 preyokti kaa pariniojan raajnneetik vishuddhta ke saarvajanik upyog main kendriya pahalu he
 It can also replace the description of an object or a person to avoid revealing confidential, sacred, or religious names to the unqualified, or to keep the identity of the subject of a conversation secret from a potential disguised audience
 
 Some euphemisms are for intentional entertainment
 jab ek vaakyansh ek preyokti ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he, to yah aksar ek roopak ban jaataa he jiskaa shabdic arth kho jaataa he
 Euphemisms can be used to hide unpleasant or disturbing thoughts, even when their literal position is certainly not offensive
 This type of euphemism is used in public relations and politics, where it is sometimes called dual

 An example is - Slavic metal for beer - * medu-ed - meaning "honey eater"
 In Germanic languages the name - including English - is derived from the color brown
 angrezi main ek or udhaaharan he "danki" jisane puraane bhaaropee-vyutpann shabd "es" ko pratisthapit kiya
 Another example is the term "dandelion", with the option of pisenlit, meaning "bedwetting", which presumably refers to the fact that dandelion may have been used as a diuretic

 The common names of illicit drugs and the plants used to obtain them often go through the same process as prohibition of extortion, as new positions are invented in order to discuss them secretly in the presence of others

 Narrated by Quinn, more recently dubbed the "euphemistic treadmill" by Steven Pinker
 treadmill or disfemizam treadmill
 unhone ab sthapit ho chuke in shabdon kaa upyog nahin kiya, lekin sambandhit prakriyaaon par 1933 main gaur kiya or tippanee kii
 Words that originally meant euphemism may lose their euphemistic value and take the negative meaning of their goal
 kuch maamalon main, unka istemaal vyangy ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he or ve disfemizam ban jate hai
 For example, the term "concentration camp", which was used to describe civilian members of the Boer community in the adjacent quarters, was used by the British during the Second Boer War, mainly because it Seemed inoffensive and non-abusive
 british kansantreshan shiviron main ucch mrityu dar ke baavjood, yah shabd preyokti ke rup main sweekaarya bana rahaa

 was done
 ye aisi preyoktiyon ke bhi udhaaharan hai jo bhugolic drushti se kendrit hai
 The term "restroom" is rarely used outside the United States
 "WC" ke maamle main, jahaan yah pehle britain main kaaphi lokapriy tha, yah ab vahaan pasand se baahar hota ja rahaa he, lekin france, germany or hungary main pasandida vinamr shabd ke rup main or adhik lokapriy ban gaya he
 Similarly, scientific or medical terms that are actually euphemisms in their native languages, such as "anus", "vagina", or "pudendum" are now considered slightly unacceptable and have been replaced by other euphemisms
 lakshyarth aasaani se samay ke saath badal jate hai
 The words "idiot", "imbasile" and "moron" in English were neutral terms used for young children, preschool and primary school mental age immature adults respectively
 jaisaa ki gresham siddhant, ke saath he, nakaaratmak lakshyarth, tatasth waalon ko baahar karata he, isliye maansik viklang vaakyansh ko prayog main laayaa gaya
 But now he is also considered rude, commonly used as an insult to a person, object, or idea
 parinamswaroop nae shabd jaise "mently chalenced", "ek bauddhik viklaangata ke saath", "adhigam kathinaaiyaan" or "vishesh aavashyaktaaon" ne "ritarded" ko pratisthapit kiya
 a similar development occurred for people with physical disabilities with the following words: shabd, arth ke aadhaar par bhi "disabled" yaa "diferently abled" se adhik sankeern he; ek vaachan-vaikaly vaale yaa varnandh vyakti ko, udhaaharan ke liye, "kripold" nahin kaha ja saktaa
) Another recent development is the person-centered phrase, which begins with words such as "personality" followed by the construction "with" and "who are" and then a noun or adjective that describes the situation
 
 udhaaharan: "persons wyeth disabilitys", "persons hu haev dislexia" aadi
 haalanki ye nirmaan is ichha se upje hai ki varnit kiye gaye logon ke "vyaktitv" par jor diya ja sake, aise nirmaan, samaan paristhitiyon par prakaash daalane ke liye bas adhik shabdon kaa prayog karte hai: udhaaharan ke liye, aise "logon kii charchaa jo andhe hai " aaj bhi saamaanya arth main logon kii bajaay vishesh rup se andhe vyaktiyon par kendrit he
 Euphemisms can also reuse words that have been out of use due to negative connotations
 upar ullikhit shabd "lem" jo sthaneey bhashaa se gaayab hone laga tha, use ek kathboli ke rup main punerjeevit hua jiskaa arth aam taur par apekshaaon par khara naa utarana yaa boring tha
 The goal of a euphemism can also be subject-specific
 1960 ke dashak ke armbh main, major lig besabaal frenchizi maalik or pramotor bill wyk, jinke pair kaa ek hissaa nahin tha, unhone us samay kii isht preyokti "viklang" ke khilaaf vivaad kiya or kaha ki unhen "kripold" pasand he kyonki yah keval varnanaatmak he or isamen "handicaped" ke samaan lakshyarth nahin hai jo kisi vyakti kii kshamta ko simit karte hai
 
 Later, comedian George Carlin gave a famous monologue about how an euphemism for critical issues can subsume appropriate attitudes such as evolving terms describing the medical problem of cumulative mental trauma in soldiers with high mental stress status
 unhone daawa kiya ki jaise-jaise haalat kaa naam or adhik jatil hota gaya or rahasyamay prathit hone laga, is bimaari se peedit logon ko gambhir bimaari vaale vyakti ke rup main kam gambhirtha se liya jane laga or parinamswaroop unhen kharaab upachaar mila
 unhone yah bhi tark diya ki vietnam yoddhaon ko uchit dekhbhaal or dhyaan mila hota yadi us avasthaa ko abhi bhi "shell shock" bulaayaa jaataa
 usee kram main, unhone bill wyk ke vichaaron ko pratibimbit karte hue kaha ki "kripold" bilkul vaid shabd he logon ko changa kiya")
 Likewise, spastic was once a neutral descriptor for a person suffering from muscular atrophy in British English
 lekin joy dekan ke britain ke bacchon ke tivi kaarykram, blue peter par aane ke baad bacchon ne "spastic" kaa prayog ek apmaan ke rup main shuru kiya or ab ise behad apmanjanak mana jaataa he
 In 1994 the Spastic Society changed its name to Scope; The children then began to use "scopers" in the same derogatory manner
 While the term was developing as an insult in British English, it was developing in a completely different form in American English
 america main, "spastic", bhaddaapan ke liye ek gaiyr-apmanjanak paryaay ban gaya, chaahe shaareerik ho yaa maansik or bevakoofi or iskaa khud kii morrkhtaa ko darshane ke liye aksar prayog kiya jaataa he
 The distinction between the British and American goals of "spastic" was firmly demonstrated in 2006 when legendary golfer Tiger Woods used "spas" to describe his playing at that year's Masters
 is tippanee par america main kisi kaa dhyaan nahin gaya, lekin isane britain main ek bade hangaame ko khadaa kar diya

 pehla vaala yaa to aakraamak ho saktaa he yaa mazaaq rup main thodaa apanjanak or duusare vaale kaa prayog aam taur par jaanboojhkar kuch aakraamak arthon main adhik kiya jaataa he
 The last one is mainly used in an argument to make a point more correct
 preyokti kaa nirmaan kai tareeke se kiya ja saktaa he
 Periphrasis or circumcussion is one of the most common - speaking around a given "word" and expressing its emotion without pronouncing it
 Over time, circulcusions become recognized as euphemisms established for particular words or ideas
 
 ek preyokti gadhane ke liye kisi varjit shabd ke uccharan yaa vartanee ko badalanaa varjit virupan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 There are surprisingly many taboo deformations in English, many of which refer to that infamous four-letter word

 Pollution such as industrial malfunctions can be changed to outgassing or runoff - a description of physical processes rather than their harmful consequences
 Some of these may be the use of precise technical terminology in place of popular usage, but beyond accuracy, the advantage of technical terminology may be the lack of emotional goals and the possibility that the general public may not understand what it really is; The disadvantage is that the real-life context will suffer
 Words such as "waste" and "wastewater" are also replaced with byproducts, recycling, reclaimed water, and effluent
 tel udyog main aayal-bejd drilling mads ko organic fez drilling mads kaa naam diya gaya, jahaan organic fez "aayal" ke liye preyokti he
 The profane words and expressions in the English language are generally derived from three areas: religion, excretion and sexual activity
 While profanity itself has been around for centuries, their limited use in the media and in public has gradually become socially acceptable and there are still many expressions that cannot be used in polite conversation

 prarthana karte samay yahudee, aam taur par "adonai" shabd kaa istemaal karte hai
 However, in a colloquial environment, it is considered inappropriate among Jews and therefore Jews generally replace the word "adonai" with the word "hashem", which literally means "name"
