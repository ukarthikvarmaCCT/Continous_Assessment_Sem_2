 Rechargeable batteries are of different sizes - from button cells to megawatt power systems
 cell ko charge karte samay uskaa dhanatmak sakriy padaarth oxykrut hokar electron detaa he
 At the same time, the negative active substance of the cell is reduced and accepts the electrons
 ye hi electron vahya paripath main dhara pravaah karaate hai
 Electrolytes can act as a simple medium through which ions can easily move from one electrode to another electrode; Or can also take an active part in the electrochemical activity occurring inside the electrolytic cell
 sanchayak bydaree ek yukti he jisamen rasinic urja sanchit kii jaati he, jo kisi bhi samay vidyut ke rup main nirmukt ho sakati he
 There are two types of storage batteries in common use: lead-acid bydaree kaa avishkaar 1859 main french bhautikashastri gaston plante ne kiya tha
 It is the oldest rechargeable battery

 Apart from these properties, its cheapness makes it attractive to be used in motorcycles, because the starter motor requires a lot of electric current when starting vehicles
 yah bydaree ek yaa anek sarvasam ikaayiyon kii bani hoti he, jinhen cell kehete hai
 The potential of each cell is two volts
 6 volt kii saadhaaran automobile bydaree main teen cell shreneeyojit hote hai
 Each cell contains acid electrolytes, usually sulfuric acid, and electrodes of sis in two or more chemical forms
 electrode praaia: dhan yaa rin pattica kehalaate hai
 These plates are equipped with a movable frame and electrical conductor, which is called a grid
 grid, dhatvik lead yaa mishradhatu tathaa sakriy lead kaa bana hota he
 The active grid fills the lead recess and performs the necessary electrical chemical work
 grid lead, antimony, tin, bismuth, arsenic tathaa anya tatwon ke alp bhinnaatmak pratishat vaali mishradhatu se dhalkar banaaya jaataa he
 The active substance in Dhana Patikka is lead peroxide
 rin pattica ke sakriy padaarth ye hai : sarrandhra, sookshm vibhajit, swat:baddh dhatvik shuddh lead tathaa alpayojya padaarth, jiskaa kaary sanrandhrata ko banaae rakhana he
 During the lifetime of the battery, the minus plate is repeatedly charged and immersed, thus the additives are required to maintain the stability of the debt plate
 prayavarti dhan tathaa rin patticoon ke madhya main pruthakkaarak lagaakar, in donon patticoon ko pruthak kar samyojit karte hai
 The separator prevents money and loan bars from touching each other
 pruthakkaarak ko amlapratirodhi tathaa vidyut apghaty evam vidyutdhara ke liye saralata se pargamya hona chahie
 This permeability should be fine-grained so that particles of active substances do not enter during the operation of the battery from the money plates
 pruthakkaarak kaa rin pattica ke baad kaa bhaag samtal hota he or dhan pattica ke vipareet ore kaa bhaag khaanchedaar yaa dharidaar hota he

 The separator is introduced by a supporting sheet of a porous material, such as glass filaments or perforated rubber
 yah prachlan dhan pattica ke parshv ke vipareet rakhaa jaataa he
 When the battery is overworked, this reinforcement is helpful in the control of the lid of the active material during its lifetime
 lead amla bydaree main vidyut apghaty praaia: tanu salphurik amla, jo bydaree ke aavesh kii avasthaa ke saath saath parivartit hota he, rahata he
 When the battery is charged, the dilution of sulfuric acid is high and the acid concentrates as the battery is immersed
 jab batariyaan purnat: aaweshit rahati hai, tab adhikansh badariyon ke vidyut apghaty kaa aapekshik dhanatv lagbhag 1
280 rahata he, lekin ushn jalwaayu main yah ghanatv 1
125 or thandhi jalwaayu main 1
300 rahata he
 Generally, the relative density of 1
15 relative to electrolyte indicates that the battery is 90 percent immersed
 jab sanchayak aaweshit rahata he, us samay lead, rin pattica or lead oxide,, dhan pattica kaa kaary karata he
 Both these plaques are immersed in the electrolytes of sulfuric acid
 visarjan ke samay sakriy padaarth tathaa vidyut apghaty main rasinic parivartan hota he
 The lead of the minus plaque is deprived of two electrons, while the lead oxide of the fillet plaque yields two electrons
 rin pattica par nimnlikhit abhikriya hoti he : The following synchronous reaction occurs on the money strip: lead monooxide salphurik amla ke saath kriya kar nimnlikhit fal detaa he : In the immersion period, both money and debt plates are covered with lead sulfate
 is samay vidyut apghaty, arthath salphurik amla, kaa aapekshik ghanatv kam ho jaataa he, kyonki kuch salphurik amla pani main parivartit ho jaataa he
 The battery is charged with the current flowing opposite to the direction in which the current is moving while the battery is in action, due to which the battery recovers its original condition, that is, lead sulphate of the fillet is in the precursor of the lead oxide
 goes
 is prakaar rin pattica par hydrogen aayan do electron mukt karata he
 Its reaction is as follows: dhan pattica par sulphate aayan do alectron mukt karata he, jisaki abhikriya nimnlikhit he : Since plumbic sulfate is not stable in water, the final reaction is as follows: aavesh kii abhikriya se vidyut apghaty kaa aapekshik ghanatv bad jaataa he
 The cycle of charge and immersion lasts until the physical structure of the battery is destroyed due to electrical decomposition or oxidation of the separator
 bydaree kii dakshata taap ke parivartan se prabhavit hoti he
 Low heat causes low efficiency
 bydaree ke aaweshit or visarjeet hone kii dar par bhi bydaree kii dakshata nirbhar karti he
 When the battery is charged slowly and immersed slowly, the battery efficiency is high

 shabd chile kii utpatti ke bare main vibhinn siddhant hai
 According to the 17th-century Spanish historian Diego de Rosales, the Incas is called the Valley of the Aconcagua "chili" from the corruption of the name of a pivotal tribal chief who conquered the area during the Inca conquest in the 15th century

 The anthem of the Ritchas is considered the main object of the Samaveda
 samaveda mukhyat: upasna se sambaddh he, somyag main aavahan ke yogya devataaon kii stutiyaan isamen praapt hoti he

 sampurna samaveda main somras, somdevtaa, somyag, sompaan kaa mahatv ankit he isliye ise sompradhan veda bhi kaha jaataa he
 Due to the different traditions of the Samagan, one of the thousand branches of Samaveda is mentioned in the Mahabhashya - 'sahastravartma Samaveda'
 ' samprati samaveda kii teen shakhayein uplabdh hai - kauthumiya, ranyneey, jaimineey
 These three branches are mainly popular in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala respectively

 The numbers 6 and 7 would never have been given initially
