pashuon se praapt renet bhi ek prakinv hi hota he
 They are the catalysts for the biological activities that occur in the body, as well as form various types of proteins in the body for the necessary reactions
 inaki bhoomika itani mahatvapurn he ki ye yaa to sharir kii rasinic kriyaaon ko aarambh karte hai yaa phir unki gati badhaate hai
 Their catalytic properties are a cyclic process
 sabhi utprerakon kii hi bhaanti, prakinv bhi abhikriya kii utpreran urja ko kam karne kaa kaary karte hai, jiske parinamswaroop abhikriya kii gati main vruddhi ho jaati he
 Most fermentation reactions occur at millions of times faster than other non-catalytic reactions
 isi prakaar anya sabhi utpreran abhikriyaaon kii tarah hi prakinv bhi abhikriya main khapate nahin hai, na hi abhikriya samya main parivartan karte hai
 Nevertheless, the molecules differ from most other catalysts in that weights are specific to a particular reaction
 prakinvon dwaara lagbhag 4000 se adhik gyaat jaivaracinic abhikriyaayein sampann hoti hai
 Some RNA molecules also catalyze reactions, a good example of which are reactions occurring in certain parts of the ribosome
 kuch kritrim anu bhi prakinvon jaisi utprerak kriyaayein dikhaate hai
 These are called artificial fermentation
 World fast enzyme - jimage Chemical elements that are produced as a result of the actions of fermentation are called substrates and reactants prepared without their presence
 jeevon ke sharir main hone vaali rasinic kriyaayein unke jivan ke liye anivaary hoti hai
 The body consists of small cells
 rasinic kriyaaon ke falswaroop in koshikaon kii sankhya main vruddhi hoti he
 The presence of sparkles is necessary for these activities to be continuous in the body
 sabstrate ke saath saadharantaya prakinvon kii abhikriyaayein teen prakaar kii hoti hai: Substrates are optimized when the molecules interact with the substrate molecules to form chemical relationships with them
 isamen prakinv, sabstrate se kriya kar uske anuon ko khandit kar detaa he
 By interacting with the substrate, the enzyme chemically changes it and changes the electron position of the molecules
 iske kaaran hi anu shesh anuon ke saath sambandh bana pate hai
 Pumps form on the substrate when they come into contact with the substrate
 prakinv ke sampark main aane par sabstrate in gaddhon ke saath kriya kar rasinic nirmaan karte hai
 On completion of this action, they release the product and are ready for action with other substrates
 is tarah prakinv kabhi nasht nahin hote, balki baar baar chakree prakriya main shaamil hote rahete hai

 saura ghadi kaa prayog surya kii disha se samay kaa gyaan karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 The style and capability of these clocks was limited to the time of day as it could not function at night
 iske phir bhi vishwa main samay jaanane hetu sabase pehle inkaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 These clocks were invented to form the basis of other time-telling clocks
 bharat main pracheen vaidic kaal se saura ghadiyon kaa prayog hota rahaa he
 The pure methods of time measurement by the solar clock in Surya Siddhanta are described in Chapters 3 and 13
 aarambhik saura ghadiyaan subah or dopaher main hi kaam karti thim
 The construction method of these clocks consisted of tying a large pillar to one end and burying it in the ground and estimating the time from the shadow of the column lying on the ground along with the sun's rotation
 madhyanh ke samay stambh kii chaaya sabase choti hoti thi jisase pataa chalata tha ki surya thik akaash ke bich main sthit he
 Such clocks were used a lot in Western Asia and Egyptian civilizations

 According to the seasons in many civilizations, solar clocks began to tell time, and in many places they also used to give knowledge of rare days like equal lengths of day and night
 kai samskritiyon main maanviya saura ghadiyaan bhi baniin jisamen ek vyakti ek nishchit sthaan par khadaa hota tha or apni parchhaayi ke badalte aakaar se samay kaa pataa lagaataa tha
 For the correct functioning of solar clocks, it was necessary that they be installed at the right places
 vishwa ke alag-alag sthanon par ek hi samay par surya bhinn dishaao main hota tha, isliye surya kii disha ke anusaar ghadiyon ko sthapit karnaa hota tha
 One way to do this is to set up the solar clock in such a way that the shadows look straight when the sun is in the middle of the sky

 a gramophone is a sound-generating device that transmits oscillations of a needle into the air to produce sound
 sooyee ek ghoomte hue ricard main bane ghumaavdaar khaanche ke sampark main hoti he
 In gramophone Greek language "gramo" means letter and "phone" means sound
 vyapak arth main kisi bhi aise yantra ko gramophone kehete hai jisase dhwani kaa abhilekhan or baad main punarutpaadan hota he
 Lien Scott first invented an instrument, the phonatograph, in 1857 by which sound could be recorded
 phonatograph main ek jhilli thi, jisase ek bahut najuk uttalok sanlagn tha
 The membrane was stretched at the thin end of a parabolic funnel
 uttolak kii nok ek aise belan par laai jaati thi jisapar ek kaagaj lipta hota tha or kaagaj par kaalikh puti hoti thi
 The cylinder was attached to a very fine screw, which moved in a horizontal direction when the cylinder rotated
 jab jhilli par dhwani padati thi or belan ghumaya jaataa tha tab chinhak kaagaj ke kaale prishth par ek sarpil rekha ban jaati thi
 Thus the sound was recorded
 abhilikhit dhwani kaa pratham vaastavik punarutpaadan tii
e
 edison dwaara san 1876 main sambhav ho sakaa
 Addison named his instrument a phonograph
 isamen ek pital kaa belan tha, jisapar sarpil rekha banaai jaati thi
 a horizontal screw was attached to the cylinder
 lagbhag 2 inch vyasavaale pital ke ek chote se belan ke munh par parchament kii ek jhilli tani jaati thi
 a steel needle was attached to the center of the membrane with the tip pierced
 sooyee kii nok ke paas ispaat kii ek kathor kamaani lagaai jaati thi
 The other end of the arch was attached to a brass cylinder
 abhilekhi bade belan par is prakaar rakhaa jaataa tha ki belan ke ghoomane par sooyee kii patali dhar sarpil khaanch ke bich main chale
 There was a layer of tin foil on the cylinder
 jab chote belan main dhwani kaa pravesh karakar jhilli ko compymaan kiya jaataa tha tab dolanon ke dabaabon kii vibhinnata ke kaaran khaanch ke tal main panni par chinhak dwaara vibhinn gaharaaiyon kii khudaai ho jaati thi
 This excavation used to correspond to sound waves
 dhwani ke punarutpaadan ke liye khaanch par ek doosraa chinhak rakhaa jaataa tha
 The marker used to go up or down the sequence following the excavation and thus force the membrane to vibrate as it was staggered at the time of recording
 jhilli ke kampan vaayu ko compit karte the or is prakaar purvadhwani kaa punarutpaadan hota tha
 Later, many improvements were made
 edison ke mom ke belanwaale phonograph ore graham bel tathaa si
es
 tentr ke gramophone main ricard par upar neeche khudaai karke nahin, varan kataai karke, dhwani abhilekhan kiya gaya
 Sound reproduction was done by electro-deposition
 phonograph kii tarah belanaakaar ricardon kaa upyog karanevaali mashine bahut dinon tak janpriya nahin, parantu inamen bahut si trutiyaan thim
 To overcome some of these errors, Emile Berliner created an instrument called the gramophone in 1887
 uske patent vivaran ke pratham rekhachitr main ek belanaakaar ricard tha, jo kaajal se pute ek kaagaj ke rup main tha
 This paper was wrapped on a drum
 kaatanevaali sooyee kshaitij disha main chalati thi or kaajal ko hataakar ek sarpil rekha banaati thi
 To reproduce, he copied the record mechanically, digging or cutting on the resistant material
 usne tanba, nikal yaa anya kisi dhaatu kaa sthaayee ricard banaaya, jisapar sarpil gahari rekha thi
 To produce recorded sound, the record was wrapped on a drum and the needle tip was placed in the groove and the drum was rotated
 berlinner ke duusare or sanshodhit gramophone main ricard ke liye ek chauras pattica kaa upyog kiya gaya
 Used to freeze a layer of ink, or paint, on a glass plate
 usapar sooyee kinare se centre kii ore, yaa centre se kinare kii ore, sarpil rekha banaati thi
 The table was rotated in a suitable way by placing a record plaque on a table
 pattica par ek aise padaarth kii parat jamaai jaati thi jo sooyee kii gati kaa bahut kam pratirodh karata tha or amlon se prabhavit nahin hota tha
 He found the beeswax dissolved in benzene suitable
 jab sooyee se ricard par khaanch ban jaati thi ore uske tal par thos khulaa rah jaataa tha, tab amla daalkar khudaai kii jaati thi or sthaayee ricard bana liya jaataa tha
 Copies of records were obtained by pressing straps of hard rubber or other material
 patticanuma ricardon kaa nirmaan san 1897 main jaakar kahin vyapaarik drushti se safal ho sakaa
 The singers were placed right in front of the mouth of the horn so that the energy of the sound could be focused on dilution
 gayak yaa vadak simatakar baithte the
 Bhopu used to be out in front of a screen
 parade ke duusari ore abhilekhan mashin hoti thi, jisamen mom jaise padaarth kii chauras pattica hoti thi
 The needle used to mark a spiral line on this plate
 vidyut jamaav kii prakriya dwaara is pattica se thos dhaatu kaa ek pratichhaap banaaya jaataa tha
 On a material that is usually hard, but soft on heating, it was copied by suppressing this reflection
 isi samay ke aas paas bahut se avishkaarakon ne punarutpaadan karanevaali mashiinon ke sudhaar kii ore dhyaan diya
 The various stages of their development are reflected by the many gramophones displayed in the Science Museum of London
 aarambh main berlinner kii mashin he, jisamen dhaatu tanupatwaali anunaad petica he
 It was operated by hand
 san 1896 main yantric niyantran kaa pravesh hua or shatabdi ke ant tak ghadi ke samaan yantra banaaya gaya, jo keval punarutpaadan ke liy prayukt hota tha
 There was dilution of celluloid, but after two years, asbestos was used
 san 1905 tak aisi anunadpetica kaa vikaas ho chukaa tha jo bina kisi mahatvapurn parivartan ke 20 varsh tak prachlit rahi
 It had an asbestos of asbestos, which was well tightened on all sides by a gasket in the form of hollow rubber rings
 jo uttolak tanupat ke centre ko sui kii nok se lodta tha, uskaa aalamb asikor kaa hota tha or uski gati kaa niyantran komal kamanion dwaara hota tha
 Larger horns were necessary for good reproduction, but when they were overloaded, they were separated from the resonator and attached to a bracket on the machine box
 anunadpetica ko bhompu se jodne ke liy ek choti nalika kaa upyog kiya gaya, jise dhvanibhuja kehete the
 The public did not like to see Bhopu, so he was inverted in the box

 Many sound grafts use Manibh and many have a rotating Ghatra or horoscope
 kuch dhwanigrah vidyudharitra kaa bhi upyogkarte hai
 By 1926 AD, the diameter of the tenth was 10-12 inches and they used to rotate 78 or 80 times in a minute
 unke ghoomane kii avadhi chaar minute tak hoti thi, parantu ab aise sudhaar kiye gaye hai ki ek hi tave se aadha ghanta tak gaanaa suna ja saktaa he
 These pan rotate 33 times in a minute
 aisa bhi prabandh kiya gaya he ki tave apane aap badalte rahete hai
 Before 1935, steel needles were often used, it was necessary to change them after walking on the same pan, but nowadays sapphire needles are used
 vidyut or yantric samudaayon kii sadrushta ke aadhaar par harrison ne san 1925 main ek parshviya abhilekhak banaaya tha
 The second important phase was the creation of a regeneration recorder for vertical recording
 san 1947 tak punarjanan abhilekhak kaa upyog parshviya abhilekhan ke liye bhi kiya jane laga
 This led to the advantage that the distortion caused by the plaque reaction on the needle was reduced

 In many places, the name of Radhakrishna is charged with Devakavya and there is some avoidance of blame, but it is not everywhere
 isse bhikhaari das ne swakiya kaa lakshan hi kuch adhik vyapak karnaa chaha or kaha, Like Dev, it is the place of beggar slave

 at: bhikhaari das bhi auron ke samaan vastut: kavi ke rup main hi hamaare saamne aate hai
 Beggar Das has treated literary and refined language
 shringaar hi us samay kaa mukhya vishay tha
 Dev wrote 'castevillas' to describe the women of different countries and castes, in which there are nines, dhobins, but the beggar Das has taken care of the rasabhava or dignity as a dhoti, rather than as a decoration
 inke 'rasasaransh' main nine, natini, dhobin, kumhaarin, barin, sab prakaar kii dootiyaan hai
 Beggar Das had more taste than Dev
 inkaa 'shringarnirnay' apane dhang kaa anoothaa kavy he
 Examples are Manohar and Saras

 Neither are these words broken on miracles, nor are they distraught for a distant thought

 Apart from pure poetry, he has also made many policy statements in which utterances are required

 The ability to say what he wanted to say in whatever manner, even if it was not very unique, was in him
