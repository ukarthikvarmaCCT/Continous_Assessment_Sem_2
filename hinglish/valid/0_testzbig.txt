 The word "rupee" has its origin in the Sanskrit word rupa or rupiah, which means raw silver and Rupyakam means silver coin
 "rupaya" shabd kaa prayog sarvapratham sher shah suri ne bharat me apane sankshipt shashan ke dauraan kiya tha
 The rupee that Sher Shah Suri carried during his reign was a silver coin weighing around 178 grains

 Later, during the Mughal rule, the coins of the three metals were standardized to strengthen the monetary system throughout the subcontinent
 sher shah suri ke shasankaal ke dauraan shuru kiya gaya ‘rupaya’ aaj tak prachlan me he
 It remained in vogue in India even during the British Raj, during which it weighed 11
66 grams and was pure silver up to 91,7% of its weight

 In the nineteenth century, when the strongest economies in the world were based on the gold standard, the value of the rupee made of silver declined drastically

 Earlier the rupee was divided into 16 annas or 64 paise or 192 pai
 rupee kaa dashamalvikaran 1869 main ceylone main, 1957 main bharat me or 1961 main pakistan main hua
 Thus an Indian rupee is now divided into 100 paise
 bharat main kabhi kabhi paise ke liye nayaa paisa shabd bhi istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 In India, currency is issued by the Reserve Bank of India, while in Pakistan it is controlled by the State Bank of Pakistan

 Karna is one of the most prominent characters in the Mahabharata
 karn ko mahabharat kaa mahanayake mana jaataa he 
 Karna was the best Dharnudhari of Mahabharata
 bhagwaan krishna or bhagwaan parashuramne swayan karnaki shreshthata ko swikaar kiya tha 
 Karna's real mother was Kunti
 karn kaa janm kunti kaa pandu ke saath vivaah hone se purv hua tha
 Karna was Duryodhana's best friend and he fought against his brothers in the war of Mahabharata
 vah surya putr tha
 Karna is considered to be an ideal donor as Karna never refuses to give anything to a seeker in charity even if it results in his own life
 karn kii chhavi aaj bhi bhartiya janamanas main ek aise mahayoddha kii he jo jeevanabhar pratikul paristhitiyon se ladata rahaa
 Many people also believe that Karna never got everything he was actually entitled to
 tarksangat rup se kaha jaae to hastinapur ke singhaasana kaa vaastavik adhikari karn hi tha kyonki vah kuru rajpariwaar se hi tha or yudhisthir or duryodhana se jyeshtha tha, lekin uski vaastavik pahchaan uski mrityu tak agyaat hi rahi
 Karna is considered a great warrior and great warrior
 karn kaa janm kunti ko mili ek vardaan swarup hua tha
 While she was a virgin, Durvasa Rishi once visited her father's palace
 tab kunti ne puure ek varsh tak rishi kii bahut achche se seva kii
 Pleased with Kunti's service, she saw from her divine vision that Pandu could not give birth to her and gave her the boon that she could produce children from any god by remembering him
 ek din utsukathavash kunarepan main hi kunti ne surya dev kaa dhyaan kiya
 From this, the Sun God appeared and gave him a son who was similar to the Sun in Tej and he was born with armor and helix that were clinging to his body since birth
 chunki vah abhi bhi avivaahit thi isaliye lok-laaj ke dar se usne us putr ko ek bakse main rakh kar gangaji main baha diya
 this karn gangaji main bahata hua ja rahaa tha ki maharaj dhritarashtra ke sarathi adhirath or unki patni radha ne use dekha or use god le liya or uskaa laalan paalan karne lage
 They named him Vasusen
 apni paalankarta mata ke naam par karn ko radhey ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Even after the revelation of his birth and being made the king of Anga, Karna always considered him as his parent and practiced all the son's religions till his death
 ang kaa raja banaae jane ke pashchaat karn kaa ek naam angaraj bhi hua
 From a very young age, Karna was more interested in warfare than in chariot like his father Adhirath
 karn or uske pita adhirath acharya dron se mili jo us samay yudhkala ke sarvshereshth aacharyon main se ek the
 Dronacharya used to teach Kuru princes at that time
 unhone karn ko shiksha dene se manaa kar diya kyonki karn ek sarathi putr tha or dron keval kshatriyon ko hi shiksha diya karte the
 After Dronacharya's dissent, Karna approached Parasurama, who used to teach only Brahmins
 karn ne swayan ko brahman bataakar parashuram se shiksha kaa aagrah kiya
 Parashurama accepted Karna's request and mastered Karna in the same manner of warfare and archery
 is prakaar karn parashuram kaa ek atyant parishramee or nipun shishy bana
 Karna was cursed by his guru Parashurama and Prithvi Mata
 iske atirikt bhi karn ko bahut se shraap mili the
 Karna's education was in its final stages
 ek dopaher kii baat he, guru parashuram karn kii jangha par sir rakhkar vishram kar rahe the
 After some time a scorpion came from somewhere and bitten on his other thigh and started making wounds
 guru kaa vishram bhang naa ho isliye karn bichchhu ko dur naa hataakar uske dank ko sahataa rahaa
 In some time Guruji's sleep broke and he saw that a lot of blood was flowing from Karna's thigh
 unhonen kaha ki keval kisi kshatriya main hi itani sahansheeltaa ho sakati he ki vah bichchhu dank ko sah le, naa ki kisi brahman main or parashuramji ne use mithyaa bhaashan ke kaaran shraap diya ki jab bhi karn ko unki di hui shiksha kii sarvaadhik aavashyaktaa hogi, us din vah uske kaam nahin aegi
 Karna, who himself did not know from which clan he belonged, apologized to his guru and said that if he had another disciple in his place, he would have done the same
 yadhyapi karn ko krodhvash shraap dene par unhen glani hui par ve apana shraap waapas nahin le sakate the
 Then he gave Karna his bow called Vijay and blessed him that he would get what he wanted most - indelible fame
 kuch lokkathaon main mana jaataa he ki bichchhu ke rup main swayan indra the, jo uski vaastavik kshatriya pahchaan ko ujagar karnaa chaahate the
 After Parashuramaji left the ashram, Karna wandered for some time
 is dauraan vah shabdabhedi vidya sikh rahaa tha
 During the practice, he considered the calf of a cow to be an endemic animal and fired a wrenching arrow at it and the calf was killed
 tab us gaay ke swami brahman ne karn ko shraap diya ki jis prakaar usne ek asahaay pashu ko maaraa he, vaise hi ek din vah bhi maaraa jayega jab vah sabase adhik asahaay hoga or jab uskaa sara dhyaan apane shatru se kahin alag kisi or kaam par hoga
 According to the folk tales of Andhra, once Karna was going somewhere, then on the way he found a girl who was crying due to ghee being shattered from her pit
 jab karn ne uske santraas kaa kaaran jaananaa chaha to usne bataaya ki use bhay he ki uski sauteli maan uski is asaavadhaanee par rusht hongi
 Kripalu Karna then told him that Bah will bring him new ghee
 tab kanya ne aagrah kiya ki use vahi mitti main mila hua ghi hi chahie or usne nayaa ghi lene se manaa kar diya
 Then, taking pity on the girl, Karna took the clay containing the ghee in her hand and started squeezing it so that the ghee from the soil squeezed and fell into the pitcher
 is prakriya ke dauraan usne apane haath se ek mahila kii pidayukta dhwani suni
 When he opened his fist, he found Mother Earth
 pidaa se krodhit dharti mata ne karn kii aalochana kii or kaha ki usne ek bacchee ke ghi ke liye unhen itani pidaa di
 And then Mother Earth cursed Karna that one day in a decisive battle of her life, she will also hold the wheel of her chariot as she has caught them in her fist, so that she is vulnerable to her enemy in that war
 Will go
 is prakaar, karn ko teen pruthak avasaron par teen shraap mili
 Unfortunately, these three curses flourished in the decisive battle of Kurukshetra, when he became unarmed, chariotless and helpless in battle
 karn ko mili vividh shraapon kaa prabhaav is prakaar hua
 If a Brahmastra is also left on the enemy's camp, it not only destroys that camp but also causes famine in that area for more than 12 years
 or yadi do brahmastra aapas main takaraa die jaaen tab to maano pralay hi ho jaataa he
 This will lead to destruction of the entire earth and thus another planet and all living beings will have to be created
 mahabharat ke yuddh main do brahmastron ke takaraane kii sthiti tab ai jab rishi vedavyasji ke ashram main ashwatthama or arjuna ne apane-apane brahmastra chalaa die
 Then Vedavyasa avoided that confrontation and asked to return his Brahmastras
 arjuna ko to brahmastra lautaanaa aata tha, lekin ashwatthama ye nahin jaanata tha or tab us brahmastra ke kaaran parakshit, uttara ke garbh se mrit paidaa hua
 But due to the curse of Karna Guru Parashuram, he forgot to drive the Brahmastra, otherwise he must have used his Brahmastra to kill Arjuna in the war and Arjuna also used his Brahmastra to protect himself and the whole earth would have been destroyed
 is prakaar guru parashuram ne karn ko shraap dekar prithvi kaa vinaash taal diya
 The curse of Mother Earth was that in the most decisive battle of Karna's life, the earth would catch the wheel of his chariot
 us din ke yuddh main karn ne alag-alag rathon kaa upyog kiya, lekin har baar uske rath kaa pahiyaa dharti main dhas jaataa
 Therefore, Karna could not escape the curse of Mother Earth even by using various chariots, otherwise it would have fallen heavily on Arjuna in that decisive war
 guru dronacharya ne apane shishyon kii shiksha puri hone par hastinapur main ek rangabhumi kaa aayojan karavaaya
 In Rangbhoomi, Arjuna became a disciple with special archery
 tabhi karn rangabhumi main aayaa or arjuna dwaara kiye gaye kartabon ko paar karke use dvandvayuddh ke liye lalakaara
 When did Kripacharya reject Karna's duel and ask him about his dynasty and empire - because according to the rules of the duel only a prince could challenge Arjuna, the prince of Hastinapur, for a duel
 tab kauravon main sabase jyeshtha duryodhana ne karn ko angadesh kaa raja ghoshit kiya jisase vah arjuna se dvandvayuddh ke yogya ho jaae
 When Karna asks Duryodhana what he wants from him in return, Duryodhana says that he only wants Karna to become his friend
 is ghatana ke baad mahabharat ke kuch mukhya sambandh sthapit hue, jaise duryodhana or karn ke bich sudrudh sambandh bane, karn or arjuna ke bich teevr pratidwandvita or pandavon tathaa karn ke bich vaimnasy
 Karna was a loyal and true friend of Duryodhana
 yadhyapi vah baad main duryodhana ko prasann karne ke liye dyutakrida main bhagidaari karata he, lekin vah armbh se hi iske viruddh tha
 Karna did not like Shakuni and always recommended Duryodhana to use his fighting skills and muscle to defeat his enemies and not devious tricks
 jab laakshagrih main pandavon ko maarane kaa prayaas vifal ho jaataa he, tab karn duryodhana ko uski kaayarta ke liye daantata he or kahata he ki kaayron kii sabhi chaalen vifal hi hoti hai or use samajhaata he ki use ek yoddha ke samaan kaary karnaa chahie or use jo kuch bhi praapt karnaa he, use apni veerta dwaara praapt kare
 Karna also assisted Duryodhana in marrying the princess of Chitrangad
 apane swayamvar main usne duryodhana ko asweekaar kar diya or tab duryodhana use balpurvak uthaa kar le gaya
 Then the other kings present there followed him, but Karna single-handedly defeated them all
 parrast raajaaon main jarasandh, shishupal, dantavakr, salve or rukmi ityadi the
 As a compliment to Karna, Jarasandha gave Karna a portion of Magadha
 bhim ne baad main shrikrishna kii sahaayta se jarasandh ko parrast kiya lekin usase bahut pehle karn ne use akele parrast kiya tha
 Karna had revealed the weakness of Jarasandha that his death can only be done by splitting his torso into two pieces
 angaraj banane ke pashchaat karn ne ye ghoshnaa kari ki din ke samay jab vah suryadev kii puja karata he, us samay yadi koi usase kuch bhi maangega to vah manaa nahin karegaa or maangane vaala kabhi khaali haath nahin lautega
 In the war of Mahabharata, Indra and Mother Kunti took advantage of this charity of Karna
 mahabharat ke yuddh ke bich main karn ke senapati banane se ek din purv indra ne karn se sadhu ke bhesh main usase uske kavach-kundal maang liye, kyonki yadi ye kavach-kundal karn ke hi paas rahete to use yuddh main parrast kar paanaa asambhav tha or indra ne apane putr arjuna kii suraksha ko dhyaan main rakhte hue karn se itnaa bady bhiksha maang lee lekin daanveer karn ne sadhu bhesh main devraj indra ko bhi manaa nahin kiya or indra dwaara kuch bhi vardaan maang lene par dene ke aashwaasan par bhi indra se ye kehete hue ki "dene ke pashchaat kuch maang lenaa daan kii garima ke viruddh he" kuch nahin maanga
 Similarly, mother Kunti was also promised by Danveer Karna that in this great war, his five sons will definitely survive and he will not kill any other Pandava except Arjuna
 or usne vahi kiya, karn ne arjuna ke vadh ke liye devraj indra se indrastra bhi maanga tha
 Karna was a marriage mover in Draupadi's Swayamvara
 anya pratidwandiyon ke vipareet, karn dhanush ko modane or us par pratyancha chadha paane main samarth tha, par jaise hi vah lakshya bhedan ke liye taiyaar hua, tab shrikrishna ke sanket par, draupadi ne karn ko soot-putr bolkar use aisa karne se roak diya
 The Pandavas were also present there in disguise of the Brahmin
 anya rajkumaron or raajaaon ke asafal rahane par arjuna aage badha or safaltaapurvak machhlee kii aankh kaa bhedan kiya or draupadi kaa haath jeet liya
 When Arjuna's identity was revealed later, Karna's sense of rivalry deepened
 karn kabhi bhi shakuni kii pandavon ko chhal-kapat se haraane kii yojanaon se sahamat nahin tha
 He was always in favor of war and always urged Duryodhana to choose the path of war
 yadhyapi vah duryodhana ko prasann karne ke liye dyutakrida ke khel main sammilit hua, jo baad main kukhyat draupadi cheer haran kii ghatana main faleebhoot hua
 When Shakuni won everything from Yudhishthira at Dutikrida by deceit, Draupadi, the Pandavis' patrani, was dragged into the Rajya Sabha by the Dushasanas and, at the instigation of Karna, Duryodhana and his brothers attempted to lose Draupadi's clothes
 karn draupadi kaa apmaan yah kahkar karata he ki jiske stri kaa ek se adhik pati ho vah or kuch nahin balki veshya hoti he
 At the same place, Bhima vows that he alone will kill Duryodhana and all his brothers in battle
 or phir arjuna, karn kaa vadh karne kii pratigya letaa he
 During the exile of the Pandavas, Karna takes over the task of making Duryodhana the emperor of the earth
 karn dwaara deshbhar main sainya abhiyaan chede gaye or usne raajaaon ko parrast kar unase ye vachan liye kii vah hastinapur maharaj duryodhana ke prati nishthavan rahenge anyathaa yudhon main maare jaaegein
 Karna was successful in all the battles
 mahabharat main varnan kiya gaya he ki apane sainya abhiyaanon main karn ne kai yuddh chede or asankhya rajyon or samrajyon ko ajnapaalan ke liye vivash kar diya jinamein hai - kamboj, shaq, keky, avantay, gandhar, madra, trigat, tangan, paanchal, videh, suhmas, ang, wang, nishaad, kaling, vatsa, ashamak, rushik or bahut se anya jinamein mlechh or vanavaasi log bhi hai
 After the peace talks with Duryodhana fail, Shri Krishna goes to Karna, the best warrior of Duryodhana
 vah karn kaa vaastavik parichay use bataaten he, ki vah sabase jyeshtha pandav he or use pandavon kii ore aane kaa paraamarsh dete hai
 Krishna assures him that since he is the eldest Pandava, Yudhishthira will leave the throne for him and he will become a Chakravati emperor
 par karn in sabake baad bhi pandav paksh main yuddh karne se manaa kar detaa he, kyonki vah apane aap ko duryodhana kaa rini samajhataa tha or use ye vachan de chukaa tha ki vah marate dam tak duryodhana ke paksh main hi yuddh karegaa
 He also tells Krishna that as long as he is in favor of the Pandavas who are in favor of truth, his defeat is also certain
 tab krishna kuch udhaas ho jate hai, lekin karn kii nishtha or mitrataa kii prashansa karte hai or uskaa yah nirnay sweekaar karte hai or use ye vachan dete hai ki uski mrityu tak vah uski vaastavik pahchaan gupt rakhenge
 Arjuna's father and Devraj Indra know that Karna will remain invincible and immortal in the battlefield as long as he has his armor and helix, which were on his body since birth
 isliye jab kurukshetra kaa yuddh asann tha, tab indra ne yah thaanee ki vah kavach or kundal ke saath to karn ko yudhakshetra main nahin jane denge
 He planned that when he is worshiping Sun God in the mid-day, he will become a beggar and ask him for his armor
 suryadev indra kii is yojana ke prati karn ko saavdhaan bhi karte hai, lekin vah unhen dhanyavad dekar kahata he ki us samay yadi koi usase uske praan bhi maang le to vah manaa nahin karegaa
 Then Suryadev says that if he is self-composed, then ask for his amoghastra from Indra
 tab apni yojananusaar indradev ek bhikshuk kaa bhesh banaakar karn se uskaa kavach or kundal maang lete hai
 Even after being warned, Karna does not refuse and cheerfully donates his armor
 tab karn kii is daanpriyata par prasann hokar vah use kuch maang lene ke liye kehete hai, lekin karn yah kehete hue ki "daan dene ke baad kuch maang lenaa daan kii garima ke viruddh he", manaa kar detaa he
 Then Indra gives him his powerful weapon, Vasavi, which he could use only once
 iske baad se karn kaa ek or naam vaikartan, padaa, kyonki usne bina sankuchit hue apane sharir se apane kavach-kundal kaat kar daan de die
 When the war of Mahabharata was near, Mother Kunti went to meet Karna and made him aware of his real identity
 vah use bataati hai ki vah unka putr he or jyeshtha pandav he
 She tells him that he calls himself 'kaunteya' and not 'radheya' and then Karna replies that he wants the whole world to know him as Radheya in the name of Naki Kontay
 kunti use kahati hai ki vah pandavon kii ore ho jaae or vah use raja banaaegein
 Then Karna says that many years ago, if they had called him Kaunteya in that Rangbhoomi, then the situation would be very different today
 par ab kisi bhi parivartan ke liye bahut der ho chuki he or ab ye sambhav nahin he
 He further states that Duryodhana is his friend and trusts him a lot and that he cannot betray his trust
 lekin vah mata kunti ko ye vachan detaa he ki vah arjuna ke atirikt kisi or pandav kaa vadh nahin karegaa
 Both Karna and Arjuna have pledged to kill each other and hence the death of either one is certain
 vah kahata he ki unke koi bhi paanch putr jivit rahenge - chaar anya pandav or usamen yaa arjuna main se koi ek
 Karna pleads with his mother to keep their relationship and the matter of his birth a secret till his death
 kunti, karn se ek or vachan maangti he ki vah nagastra kaa upyog keval ek baar kare
 Karna also gives this promise to Kunti
 parinamswaroop baad main kurukshetra ke yuddh main karn ek baar se adhik nagastra kaa prayog nahin kar paata
 Before the Mahabharata war began, Bhishma, who was the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army, refused Karna to participate in the battlefield under his leadership
 yadhyapi duryodhana unase nivedan karata he, lekin ve nahin maanate
 And then Karna comes to the battlefield on the eleventh day after his injuries on the tenth day
 terahave din ke yuddh main, kaurav sena ke pradhan senapati, guru dronacharya dwaara, yudhisthir ko bandi banane ke liye chakravyuuh / padmavyuuh kii rachana kii gai
 On the Pandava side, only Krishna and Arjuna knew the Chakravyuh penetrations
 lekin us din unhen trigat naresh-bandhu yuddh karte-karte chakravyuuh sthal se bahut dur le gaye
 Trigat was a kingdom under Duryodhana
 arjuna-putr abhimanyu ko chakravyuuh main keval pravesh karnaa aata tha, usase nikalnaa nahin, jise usne tab suna tha jab vah apni mata ke garbh main tha or uske pita arjuna uski mata ko yah vidhi samajha rahe the or bich main hi unhen nind aa gai
 But as soon as Abhimanyu entered the Chakravyuh, the Indus King - Jayadratha blocked the entrance and did not allow other Pandavas to enter
 tab shatruchakra main abhimanyu akelaa pad gaya
 He fought valiantly even when alone and he single-handedly defeated the great warriors of the Kaurava army
 karn or duryodhana ne guru dron ke nirdeshaanusaar abhimanyu kaa vadh karne kaa nirnay liya
 Karna shot an arrow and broke Abhimanyu's bow and a wheel of chariot, which caused him to fall to the ground and was attacked by other Kauravas
 is yuddh main abhimanyu maaraa gaya
 At the end of the war, when Arjun learns that Jayadratha has the biggest hand in killing Abhimanyu, he vows that he will kill Jayadratha before the next day's sunset, otherwise he will take fire
 chaudaaven din kaa yuddh avilakshan rup se suryaast ke baad tak chalata rahaa or bhimputra ghatotkach, jo ardh-asur tha, kaurav senaaon kaa bade paimaane par sanhaar karata rahaa
 Usually, Asuras become very powerful during the night
 duryodhana or karn ne veerta se uskaa saamana kiya or usase yuddh kiya
 Finally, when it seemed that on the same night Ghatotkacha would kill the entire Kaurava army, Duryodhana requested Karna to get rid of this problem in some way
 karn ko vivash hokar shakti astr ghatotkach par chalaanaa padaa
 This weapon was given by Devraj Indra to Karna as a tribute to his charity
 lekin karn is astr kaa prayog keval ek baar kar saktaa tha, jiske baad yah astr indra ke paas laut jayega
 Thus, after using the Shakti weapon on Ghatotkacha, he could not later use it on Arjuna
 is din karnaka yuddh bhimse hua tha 
 Bhima challenged Karnako but the plight of Bhima
 karnane bhimko bhumiper ghasita or bhimke sab vastra chhin liye
 Then Karna gave Bhima to life
 phir jab arjunase saamana hua tab bhagwaan krishna arjunako karnake vaishnavastrase bachaa lete he 
 Karna took Arjun, his tirose, but gave life for the sunset
 satrahawein din se pehle tak, karn kaa yuddh arjuna ke atirikt sabhi pandavon se hua
 He also defeated these Pandavas in a one-on-one battle, including Mahabali Bhima
 par mata kunti ko die vachananusaar usne kisi bhi pandav kaa vadh nahin kiya
 Karna raised his victory bow and fired Bhargavastra on Arjuna
 bhargavaastra se karodo yoddha maare gayi or baaki praano kii raksha ke liye arjuna ke paas gayi 
 Arjuna said that it is impossible to abrogate Bhargavastra and if Karna will let him escape then he will run away from war
 krishna ne bhaybheet arjuna ko dekha or sochaa karn jab thak jaayegaa tab arjunako uske saamne laana thik hoga 
 Thinking so much, Krishna made a path of escape for Arjuna
 arjuna ko jaan bachaakar bhaagta dekh karn ne bhargavaastra ko waapas le liya 
 The clock finally arrived in the seventeenth day of war, when Karna and Arjun came face to face
 is shandaar sangram main donon hi baraabar the
 Karna was given a bow called Vijay by his guru Parashurama, which was designed by Vishwakarma himself
 duryodhana ke nivedan par pandavon ke mamaa shalya, karn ke sarathi banane ke liye taiyaar hue
 As a matter of fact, Arjuna's charioteer was Sri Krishna himself and Karna was not to be inferior to Arjuna in any case so that he was surgically requested to become a charioteer because he had all the qualities that a qualified charioteer should have
 ran ke dauraan, arjuna ke baan karn ke rath par lage or uskaa rath kai gaj peeche khisak gaya
 But, when Karna's arrows hit Arjuna's chariot, his chariot slipped away only a few times
 isapar shri krishna ne karn kii prashansa kii
 Surprised at this, Arjuna asked the reason for this praise of Karna, because his arrows were more effective in pushing the chariot back
 tab krishna ne kaha ki karn ke rath par keval karn or shalya kaa bhaar he, lekin arjuna ke rath par to swayan ve or hanuman virajman he or tab bhi karn ne unke rath ko kuch baalist peeche khiskaa diya
 Similarly, Karna cut the bow of Arjuna 13 times
 karn or arjuna ne divine astron ko chalaane ke apane-apane gyaan kaa purna upyog karte hue bahut lambaa or ghamaasan yuddh kiya
 "nagastra" was used by Karna to separate Arjuna from the head
 lekin shri krishna dwaara sahi samay par rath ko bhoomi main thodaa sa dhansa liya gaya jisase arjuna batch gaya
 This led to "nagastra" piercing his crown just above Arjuna's head
 nagastra par upasthit ashwasena naag ne karn se nivedan kiya ki vah us astr kaa dobaaraa upyog kare taaki is baar vah arjuna ke sharir ko bedhta hua nikal jaae, lekin karn mata kunti ko die vachan kaa paalan karte hue us astr ke punah prayog se manaa kar detaa he
 Although the war was getting stale, Karna got entangled when a wheel of his chariot got stuck in the earth
 vah apane ko divine astron ke prayog main bhi asamarth paata he, jaisaa kii uske guru parashuram kaa shraap tha
 Then Karna comes down to take off the wheel of his chariot and pleads with Arjuna that he should stop shooting arrows for a while, following the rules of war
 tab shrikrishna, arjuna se kehete hai ki karn ko koi adhikaar nahin he ki vah ab yuddh niyamon or dharm kii baat kare, jabaki swayan usne bhi abhimanyu vadh ke samay kisi bhi yuddh niyam or dharm kaa paalan nahin kiya tha
 He further said where his religion had gone when he called the divine-born Draupadi as a prostitute in front of the entire Kuru Rajya Sabha
 dhyut-krida bhawan main uskaa dharm kahan gaya tha
 So now he has no right to talk about any religion or war rules and he told Arjuna that Karna is helpless now so he should kill him
 shrikrishna kehete hai ki yadi arjuna ne is nirnaayak mode par abhi karn ko nahin maaraa to sambhavtah pandav use kabhi bhi nahin maar sakenge or yah yuddh kabhi bhi nahin jeeta ja sakegaa
 Then, Arjuna beheaded Karna using a divine weapon
 karn ke sharir ke bhoomi par girane ke baad ek jyoti karn ke sharir se nikali or surya main samahit ho gai
 After the end of the war, funeral ceremonies were being performed for the dead
 tab mata kunti ne apane putron se nivedan kiya kii ve karn ke liye bhi saare mritak sanskaron ko karen
 When he protested against this by saying that Karna is a Sood son, Kunti revealed the secret of Karna's birth
 tab sabhi pandav bhaiyon ko bhratrihatya ke paap ke kaaran jhatka lagata he
 Yudhishthira is particularly angry with his mother and curses her and all women, that women will not be able to hide any distinction since that time
 yudhisthir or duryodhana, donon karn kaa antim sanskaar karnaa chaahate the
 Yudhishthira's claim was that since he is the junior brother of Karna, this right belongs to him
 duryodhana kaa daawa yah tha kii yudhisthir or anya pandavon ne karn ke saath kabhi bhi bhratruvat vyavhaar nahin kiya isliye ab is samay is adhikaar ko jataane kaa koi auchity nahin he
 Sri Krishna then intervenes and explains to Yudhishthira that the bond of Duryodhana's friendship is stronger, so let Duryodhana perform the last rites of Karna
 jab 18-din kaa yuddh samaapt ho jaataa he, to shrikrishna, arjuna ko uske rath se neeche utar jane ke liye kehete hai
 When Arjuna descends, they take him some distance
 tab ve hanumanji ko rath ke dhvaj se utar aane kaa sanket karte hai
 As Shri Hanuman descends from that chariot, the horse of Arjuna's chariot is consumed alive and the chariot explodes
 yah dekhakar arjuna dahal uthta he
 Sri Krishna then tells him that due to Karna's deadly weapons, this explosion has occurred in Arjuna's chariot
 yah ab tak isliye surakshit tha kyonki us par swayan unki krupa thi or shri hanuman kii shakti thi jo rath ab tak in vinaashkari astron ke prabhaav ko sahan kiye hue tha
 Even today for millions of Hindus, Karna is a warrior who lived a sad life all his life
 use ek mahaan yoddha mana jaataa he, jo saahasik aatmbal yukt ek aisa mahanayake tha jo apane jivan kii pratikul sthitiyon se jujhataa rahaa
 Karna in particular is famous for his charity
 vah is baat kaa udhaaharan bhi he ki kis prakaar anuchit nirnay kisi vyakti ke shreshth vyaktitv or uttam gunon ke rahete hue bhi kisi kaam ke nahin hote
 Karna never got what he was entitled to, but he never stopped trying
 bhishma or bhagwaan krishna sahit karn ke samakalinon ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki karn ek puneatma he jo bahut virale hi maanav jati main prakat hote hai
 He is an ideal for the struggling humanity that mankind should never give up and strive
 karn or arjuna main bahut si samantaayein hai
 Both were the best archers of their time, both competed in the contest to win Draupadi's hand and both had to fight in the war against their brothers
 ek or gaharaa sangyojan yah kii donon hi kauravon se nikatataa se jude hue the, karn mitrataavat or arjuna raktarat
 Their decisions and consequent consequences on them and their families are emphasized as to what is the importance of performing one's duties as stated by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad-gītā
 karn ek aise vyaktitv kaa udhaaharan he jo guni, daanveer, nyaaypriy or saahsee tha lekin phir bhi uskaa patan hua kyonki vah adharmee duryodhana ke prati nishthavan tha
 Karna had the five qualities that Draupadi had asked Mahadev as her groom, leaving only one and that was close friendship with Duryodhana
 arjuna va karn main samantaayein or vishamtaayen dono hi thi
 Arjuna got happiness, wealth and maternal love from the beginning, while Karna had to get everything
 arjuna ke paas har wo vastu thi jo uske vijayi banaati lekin karn sarvatha akelaa tha
 It was because of his truth that he got all the curse which he accepted with a curse
 ek vishleshan ke anusaar karn or arjuna ke yuddh ke samay ek aisa avasar aayaa jab arjuna ne itani shakti se ek aisa baan chalaaya jo sidhe karn ke rath par laga or uskaa rath das kadam peeche khisak gaya, is par karn ne bhi itani shakti se ek aisa baan chalaaya jo sidhe arjuna ke rath par laga or uskaa rath do kadam peeche khisak gaya
 When Karna did this, Lord Krishna started praising Karna
 jab arjuna ne bhagwaan krishna se karn ki is prashansa kaa kaaran poocha to unhone kaha ki tumhaare rath par tribhuvan kaa bhaar lekar main baitha hoon tathaa tumhaare rath ki dhwaja par swayan hanumanji virajman hai
 It is impossible to move it backward even if it is impossible to move away like a molecule, but even if Karna has moved your chariot two steps back then it is not only a matter of surprise but praise and pride duryodhana ke prati karn ke sneh ke kaaran, yadhyapi anicchhuk rup se, usne apane priy mitra ke pandavon ke prati sabhi kukarmon main uskaa saath diya
 Karna had knowledge of Duryodhana's malicious plans towards the Pandavas
 use yah bhi gyaan tha kii asat ke liye sat se takaraane ke kaaran uskaa patan bhi nishchit he
 While some believe that Karna himself took a soot vessel in his name by using the word 'vaishya' for Draupadi in the Kuru Rajya Sabha, some others believe that he was right in his act, because earlier Draupadi had insulted him by calling him a 'sutra' in his swayamvar so that he could not become a competitor in his swayamvar
 phir bhi, abhimanyu ke maare jane main karn kii bhoomika or ek yoddha se anek yoddhaon ke ladane ke kaaran uske ek mahayoddha hone kii chhavi ko kahin adhik kshati pahaunchi or phir usee yuddh main uski bhi vahi gati hui
 According to some interpretations of Mahabharata, it was this act which properly proved that Karna is fighting in favor of unrighteousness in the war and due to this act his misfortune was also determined that he too was likewise by Arjuna
 Will be killed when the weapon is inferior and chariotless and has its back towards Arjuna
 karn ke paas satrahawein din ke yuddh main arjuna kaa vadh karne kaa puraa avasar tha lekin yuddh niyamon kaa paalan karte hue usne arjuna par baan nahin chalaaya kyonki tab tak suryadev ast ho chuke the
 The story of Karna and Arjuna's past birth is described in the Padma Purana
 Once there is a war between Lord Brahma and Mahadev, Mahadev cuts off the fifth head of Brahma
 krodhit brahmadev ke sharir se pasina nikalataa he
 And a brave warrior arises from sweat
 jo swead se janma isliye swedja ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Svedja goes to war with Mahadeva on the orders of Father Brahma
 mahadev bhagwaan vishnu ke paas krodhit brahma dwaara janm lene vaale swedja kaa kuch upaay bataane ko kehete hai
 Lord Vishnu gives birth to a hero with his blood
 rakt se janma isliye use raktaja ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Svedja was born with 1000 armor and Raktaja with 1000 hands and 500 bow
 bhagwaan brahma bhi vishnu se hai utpann huj the isliye swedja bhi bhagwaan vishnu kaa ansh tha
 There is a fierce war between Svedja and Raktja
 swedja, raktaja ke 998 haath cat detaa he or 499 dhanush tod detaa he
 The same blood breaks the 999 armor of Svedja
 raktaja bas haarane hi vaala hota he
 Lord Vishnu understands that he will be defeated by blood
 isliye ve us yuddh ko shant karavaate hai
 Svedaja gives blood to Ravnaja, displaying charity
 bhagwaan vishnu swedja kii javabdehi suryanarayan ko sonpate he, or raktaja kii indradev ko
 He pledges to Indradev that in next life, Raktaja will surely kill his rival Svedja
 dwapar yug main raktaja arjun or samvednaa karn ke rup main janm lete hai
 And Arjun kills his greatest rival, Karna, against the rules of war
 karn kii mrityu ke sambandh main nimnlikhit kaarak ginaae ja sakate hai:1
 karn kii mrityu kaa sarvapratham kaarak to swayan rishi durvasa hi hai
 While giving this boon to Kunti that she can invoke any god and get children from him, did not tell about the result of this boon
 isliye, kunti utsukata vash suryadev kaa aahvaan karti he or yah dhyaan nahin rakhti kii vivahpurv iske kya parinaam ho sakate hai or varadananusaar suryadev kunti ko ek putr dete hai
 But due to fear of public shame, Kunti pours this baby into Gangaji
 tab karn, maharaj dhritarashtra ke sarathi adhirath or unki patni radha ko miltaa he ve uskaa laalan-paalan karte he or is prakaar karn kii kshatriya pahchaan nishedh kar di jaati he
 Karna, not Yudhishthira or Duryodhana, was the de facto officer of the throne of Hastinapur, but this could never happen because his birth and identity were kept secret
 2
 devraj indra jinhone bichchhu ke rup main karn kii kshatriya pahchaan uske guru ke saamne laa di or apni pahchaan ke sambandh main apane guru se mithyabhaashan ke kaaran uske guru ne use sahi samay par uskaa shastrastra gyaan bhul jane kaa shraap de diya
 3
 Just as he cursed a Brahmin with cow, he has killed a helpless and innocent animal, similarly he will be killed when he is most helpless and will focus on something other than his enemy
 isi shraap ke kaaran arjuna use tab martha he jab uske rath kaa pahiyaa dharti main dhans jaataa he or uskaa dhyaan apane rath ke pahie ko nikaalane main laga hota he
 4
 Earth will curse the mother at the appointed time and eat the wheel of her chariot and she will be most constrained in front of her enemies
 5

 9
 maharaj or karn ke sarathi pandavon ke mamaa shalya, jinhone satrahawein din ke yuddh main arjuna kii yuddh kala kii prashansa karke karn kaa manobal gira diya
 10
 a few days before the war, when Karna came to know that the Pandavas were his brothers, all his ill-will towards him ended, but he fought against the Pandavas because of his allegiance to Duryodhana
 jabaki karn kii mrityu hone tak pandavon ko yah nahin pataa tha kii karn unka jyeshtha bhai he

 Physics begins with a relative object

 a point of reference is required to indicate the position of any object or particle in the problem

 There are at least two meanings in the physics of the postulate theory: chirsmmat bhautikee main shaamil bhautikee ke siddhanth: Deserts or deserts are called geographical areas where the waterfall is much less than in other areas
 praayah retile registani maidaanon ko marusthal kaha jaataa he joki galat he
 It is another matter that the area with least rainfall in India is a sandy plain
 marusthal kaa retila hona aavashyak nahin
 It is also not necessary to warm the desert
 antarctic, joki barf se dhakaa pradesh he, vishwa kaa sabase bada marusthal he ! vishwa ke anya deshon main kai aise marusthal hai jo retile nahin he
 Deserts can be divided on the basis of rainfall, average temperature, number of days without rainfall in a year, etc
 bharat kaa thar marusthal ek ooshna katibandheey marusthal he jiske kaaran hi yah retila bhi he
 The total of rain and snowfall is called waterfall
 yadi kisi kshetra kaa jalpaat 200 millimetre se bhi kam ho to vah ek prakaar kaa pradesh he
 Similarly, the area up to 250–500 millimeters can be kept in a separate square
 isi prakaar anya kshetra bhi vargeekrut kiye ja sakate hai
 These regions can also be classified in terms of temperature
 jab ek vishaal parvat varsha ke badalon ko aage kii disha main badhane main baadha utpann karata he tab uske aage kaa pradesh vrishtiheen ho jaataa he or ise vrishtichaaya kshetra kehete hai
 There is no rain on the higher mountains, so they are also placed in the category of desert
 marusthal kaa saamaanya gun to yah he ki isamen varsha kam hoti he
 These areas are often sparsely populated, have negligible vegetation, cut off potholes, lack of water resources, evaporation over water supply

 wilhem dwitiya yaa wiliam dwitiya germany kaa antim samraat tathaa prasha kaa raja tha jisane german samrajya evam prasha par 15 june 1888 se 9 navambar 1918 tak shashan kiya
 After the death of William I, his son Fadric III ascended the throne of Germany on 9 March 1888 AD
 kintu keval 100 din rajya karne ke baad uski mrityu ho gai
 On his death, his son William II ascended the throne
 vah ek navayuvak tha
 It was a combination of many qualities and fortifications

 He was selfish and arrogant and believed in the divine doctrine of the king
 kisi anya vyakti ke niyantran main rahanaa usko asay tha jiske kaaran kuch hi dinon ke uparaant uski apane chancelar bismark se anban ho gai
 Bismarck was forced to resign due to circumstances
 bismark ke patan ke uparaant wiliam ne samast satta ko apane haathon main liya or uske mantri aagyaakaari sevak ban gayi or vah swayan kaa shashan kaa karnadhaar bana
 William Kaiser was a very obstinate, ambitious and angry person
 vah kahata tha ki hamaara bhavishya samudr par nirbhar he
 His attempt to make Germany a maritime power had gained permanent hostility to England
 uski niti thi- 'sampurna vishwa par apana prabhutv sthapit karnaa
 'if he did not succeed in this, then he was ready for the destruction of the world
 vyapaarik desh hone ke kaaran england yuddh ke paksh main nahin tha, jise wiliam kaisar england kii kaayarta samajhataa tha
 He wanted to expand his empire by intimidating England in an aggressive attitude and it was a misconception that England would want to avoid war at any cost
 is prakaar wiliam kaisar ke ugr, samrajyavaadee, nirankush tathaa swechhachari vyaktitv ne europe ko mahayuddh ke kagaar par pahunchaa diya
 Caesar William II had the following three main objectives of world policy - uparokt uddeshyon kii purti karne ke abhipraay se kaisar wiliam dwitiya ne germany kii ‘videsh niti’ kaa sanchaalan karnaa aarambh kiya
 Due to the first objective, a close alliance with Austria was necessary, as he also wanted to move in the same direction and control the port of Salonika
 iskaa arth tha, madhya europe ke kootneetijna gut ko sudrudh bananaa
 Due to the conflict between the interests of Austria and Russia, it also meant the separation from Russia and finally making it their adversary
 duusare uddeshy kii purti kaa arth tha, 'sansar main jahaan kahin bhi aavashyak ho, visheshkar africa main, germany kii shakti kaa pradarshan karnaa
 'in this regard, Morocco challenged France twice in 1905 AD and 1911 AD
 tisare uddeshy kii purti kaa spasht parinaam tha england ke saath teevr pratisparddha or vaimnasy
 In summary, the natural consequence of this new policy was the hostility of Russia, France and England, and eventually the three of them converging in combat, that is, the destruction of all of Bismarck's work
 wiliam dwitiya ne apni niti se uski samast vyavastha ko nasht kar diya
 Within three years, Russia seceded from Germany and later ended her isolation by negotiating a treaty with France
 6 varsh ke andar england shatru ban gaya
 The hostility from France intensified with the intervention of Morocco, and by 1907, the Triassic Friendship of France, Russia and England was established in comparison with the threesome of Germany, Austria and Italy
 italy kaa trigut se sambandh bhi shithil padataa ja rahaa tha kintu wiliam dwitiya ne is disha main koi prayaas nahin kiya
 The Rehabilitation Treaty was to be repeated in 1890 AD by Bismarck in Germany and Russia, while William wanted to establish stronger ties with Austria than Russia so that he could succeed in bringing the eastern Mediterranean into his sphere of influence through the Balkans
 
 rus ne bhi is punaraashwaasan sandhi kii punrariti ko yah kahkar manaa kar diya ki 'sandhi badi pechida he or isamen austria ke liye dhamkee maujuud he jiske bade anishtakaari parinaam ho sakate hai
 ' punaraashwaasan sandhi kii punrariti ke na hone kaa spasht parinaam yah hua ki rus akelaa rah gaya
 It became mandatory for him to search for a friend to overcome his isolation
 abusake saamne uske shatru england or france hi the
 But being forced by his situation, he was attracted to befriend France and tried to befriend him
 ant main, 1895 i
 main donon deshon main sandhi hui jo dwigut sandhi ke naam se prasiddh he
 France was greatly benefited by this treaty and her loneliness ended
 wiliam bada mahatvakankshi tha
 He wanted to make Germany not only the fortune-maker of Europe, but the fortune-maker of the world
 bismark vishwa ke jhagadon se germany ko alag rakhana chahta tha,kintu wiliam ne europe ke baahar ke jhagadon main hastkshep karnaa aarambh kar diya
 He was not satisfied with German influence only in the Balkan Peninsula, but he wanted to see him as a world power
 isi uddeshy ke liye 1890 i
 ke uparaant germany kii vaideshik niti main vishwa-vyapee niti kaa samavesh hua
 Many of William's speeches reflect his views
 usne in pradeshon ko apane adhikaar main kiya - William wanted to bring Turkey under his sphere of influence and was a major part of his world policy
 england bhi is ore prayatnsheel tha
 He did not want to allow the dominance of any European nation to be established in Turkey, as this could have caused fear to his Indian empire
 1878 i
 kii berlin-congress tak turki par england kaa prabhutv rahaa or jab kabhi bhi kisi europea rastra ne us ore pragati karne kaa vichaar kiya to england ne uskaa datakar virodh kiya, parantu cyprus ke samjhaute ke uparaant uskaa prabhaav turki par se kam hone laga
 When England took control of Egypt in 1882 AD, the goodwill that existed between England and Turkey started to end
 ab wiliam dwitiya ne is paristhiti kaa laabh uthaakar turki ko apane prabhaav-kshetra main laane kaa praytn kiya
 In this regard, he took the following measures: kustuntuniya tak rail banane kaa bhi tha
 The opening of this route would have exposed Germany to the Persian Gulf, which would have become a matter of special concern for the Indian Empire of England
 wiliam turki ko apni ore aakarshith karne main avashya safal hua, kintu usne apni is niti se rus, france or england ko apana shatru bana liya jabaki turki kii shakti in teenon bade rashtron ke saamne naganya thi
 This policy of William cannot be called a successful policy
 usne teenon raashton ko ek saath aprasann kiya jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki tridaleey gut kaa nirmaan sambhav ho gaya
 By 1890, Germany and England had a good relationship, but when Germany started adopting a worldwide policy during the reign of William II, relations between Germany and England began to get tighter
 bismark ke pad tyaag karne ke uparaant wiliam ne germany kii nausena main vistaar karnaa aarambh kiya to england germany kii badhati hui shakti se sashankit hone laga tha
 For some time, the friendship of both of them increased, but after 1896 AD, the relationship between the two started getting bitter
 jab wiliam ne transwaal ke rastrapati cruger ko james ke akraman par vijay praapt karne ke upalaksh main badhai kaa taar bheja
 This wire created a great disarray among the people of England
 maharani victoria ne bhi apane pautra wiliam dwitiya ke is kaary kii badi ninda kii
 At this time England did not think it right to spoil relations with Germany, because he would have been left alone
 isi uddeshy kii purti ke liye usne germany se achche sambandh sthapit karne kaa praytn kiya
 Agreements between the two countries were also made with respect to Africa in 1898 AD and regarding armies in 1899 AD
 usee varsh england ke upnivesh mantri joseph chemberlen ne england, germany or sanyukt rajya ke ek trigut ke nirmaan kaa prastaav kiya, kintu 1899 i
 main bulo ne jo is samay germany kaa pradhanmantri tha, is prastaav ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 The reason for his rejection of this proposal was that it meant England to take the side of Germany in the ensuing wars and take part in the war as its supporter, and England settled from the European continent in Asia and Africa
 The empire continued to expand
 bulo kaa yah vichaar tha ki germany kii aupniveshik, vyapaarik tathaa navik unnati se england ko asuvidha hona anivaary thi or kabhi bhi donon main yuddh chhid saktaa he
 Therefore, it was well understood by the policies of Germany that over-trusting Germany would prove fatal for England and indeed a day would come when England and Germany would go to war
 france or rus ke madhya mitrataa kii sthapana ho chuki thi, ab france dwaara rus or england kii mitrataa kaa kaary aarambh hua
 In 1907, with the efforts of France, the faction of Russia and England became ready
 yah gut rakshaatmak tha kintu german samraat wiliam dwitiya ko iske nirmaan se badi chintaa hui
 Now he particularly attracted his attention towards the end of this group
 isi samay germany ko purvi samasya main hastkshep karne tathaa rus ko apamaanit karne kaa avasar praapt hua
 1908 AD There was a movement in Turkey which is known as the Young Turk Movement
 sheeghra hi austria ne bosnia tathaa harjegovina adhikaar kar liya
 Serbia could not bear it and started preparing for war
 usko yah aashaa thi ki austria tathaa germany ke viruddh rus or england uski sahaayta karne kii udyat ho jaayenge kintu rus kii abhi aisi sthiti nahin thi
 Austria dealt with Serbia very harshly, which made the war seem inevitable, but when Germany made a clear declaration that if Russia would help Serbia in any way, it would be able to fully support Austria in the war
 is ready
 is prakaar yuddh tal gaya
 At this time, Russia did not have the power to successfully counter the combined services of Germany and Austria
 rus ko baadhya hokar dab janaa padaa or german raajnneeti balkan prayadweep main safal hui
 Although the german-emperor William Kaiser succeeded in demoralizing Russia in the Balkan region and was able to expand the power and influence of his friend Austria, he remained fearful of the factions of France, Russia and England
 usne france or rus se mitrataa karne kii ore haath badhanaa aarambh kiya
 On 8 February 1909, he entered into an agreement with France, according to which France accepted the principle of independence and integrity of Morocco
 germany ne morocco kii aantarik suraksha ke sambandh main france kii asaadhaaran sthiti maan lee
 Convinced here, Germany drew its attention to compromise with Russia
 germany ne rus se navambar 1910 main mesopotamia or faras main apane hiton ke sambandh main samjhauta kiya, jiske dwaara 'rus ne germany ko berlin-baghdad railway kii yojana kaa virodh na karne kaa vachan diya or wiliam ne faras main rus ke hiton kii sweekruti pradaan kii
 ' uparokt kaaryo dwaara wiliam dwitiya rus, france or england ke gut ko nirbal karne main safal hua, kintu yah sthiti adhik kaal tak sthaayee nahin rah saki
 France and Germany attempted to address the Moroccan question, but both were not satisfied with the status of the agreement
 ‘morocco kii swatantraaa’ tathaa france kii police satta main swaabhaavik virodh tha jiske kaaran bhavishya main jhagada hona nishchit tha
 France was bent on bringing Morocco completely under its control and Germany was determined to stop it or to receive a suitable reward in return
 1911 i 
 main morocco main ek aisi ghatana ghati jisane europe ke pramukh rashtron kaa dhyaan us ore aakarshith kiya
 The fire of civil war ignited in Morocco and the Sultan of Morocco failed to suppress the rebellion
 is paristhiti ke utpann hone par france ne aantarik suraksha ke liye apane uttardaayitv kaa bahaanaa lekar ek sena bheji, jisane 21 may 1910 i
 ko morocco main vidroh kaa daman karnaa aarambh kar diya
 Germany could not tolerate such interference from France, and Germany's foreign minister declared that 'if France found it necessary to stay in Morocco, then the full problem of Morocco would be reconsidered and all the powers that signed the Algysiraj Act The freedom to work as per his wish will be regained
 ' vidraahiyon ke daman ke uparaant france kii senaayen vaapis lautne lagi, kintu is par bhi germany ne apane kade vyavhaar main kisi prakaar parivartan karnaa uchit nahin samajha
 In July 1910 AD, Germany announced that it had sent a warship to the port called Ezir in southern Morocco for the purpose of protecting German interests and German residents
 germany ke is vyavhaar ne badi sankatmay paristhiti utpann kar di or yah sambhaavna spasht drushtigochar hone lagi ki sheeghra hi europe ke raashton ke madhya yuddh kaa hona anivaary he
 Finally, a treaty was signed between France and the Germans, which was concluded on 4 November 1911, according to which it was decided that France's patronage over Morocco would continue and Germany received half the territory of the French Congo
 morocco ke prashn par germany ko munh kii khaani padi, kyonki rus, france or england kaa trirashtiy gut pehle kii apeksha ab adhik drudh tathaa sthai ho gaya tha tathaa germany or england ke sambandh din-pratidin kharaab hone aarambh ho gaye
 a steam turbine is a mechanical device that extracts heat energy from pressurized steam and converts it into mechanical work
 aadhunik rup main iskaa avishkaar sar charles parcens ne 1884 main kiya tha
 a steam turbine is a conductor, in which the high-speed steam is driven into a rotor by converting the heat energy of the steam into kinetic energy, and colliding on a number of panels that rotate and operate
 anyonyagtik bhaap ingine main bhaap kii sthitik daab dwaara piston par kaary kiya jaataa he
 Although the steam in the engine moves with the piston, the effect of the kinetic energy of steam in the action of the engine is negligible
 bhaap tarabine main bhaap ingine kii apeksha ucchtar gati mil sakati he or gatisima bhi badi ha sakati he
 Turbine parts have good balance
 bhaap kii samaan maatra evam samaan avasthaa main bhaap tarabine bhaap ingine se adhik shakti paidaa kar saktaa he
 Steam consumption increases after a few years of working with a steam engine, but the turbine does not have such a state
 The steam turbine is the most durable of all the original drivers on earth
 tarabine se sabase bada laabh yah hota he ki isse ghurnak gati sidhe praapt hoti he, jabaki bhaap ingine main anyonyagati se ghurnak gati praapt karne ke liye alag se upadan kaa vyavahar karnaa padataa he
 In a vaporizer, steam is produced at high pressure and temperature
 jab yah bhaap tarabine ke paas pahunchati he, us samay isamen adhik maatra main ushma urja hoti he or isaki daab bhi itani adhik hoti he ki yah nimnadaab tak prasaarit ho sakati he
 But at that time its kinetic energy is negligible
 at: bhaap kuch kaary kar sake iske pehle isaki ushma urja ko gatij urja main parivartit kiya jaataa he
 This change occurs in the well-designed device, expanding the steam
 bhaap kaa prasar yaa to ek hi kriya main purna kiya jaataa he, yaa vibhinn kriyaaon main
 This means that many stationary devices are put into practice to convert heat energy into kinetic energy and often a moving device is placed between two stationary devices
 sthir upkaran main praapt gatij urja ko uske baad bandhe hue gatiman upkaran ke upar kaary karne ke liye lagaaya jaataa he
 The world's first rotating engine was built in 50 AD by the Hero of Alexandria
 isamen do kilkon ke bich ek khokhli gend lagi thi
 At the bottom of the turbine, a vessel was placed to make steam, so that steam could enter the ball
 vahaan se bhaap gend main lagi hui do traigy nalikaaon dwaara baahar aati thi isi ke kaaran gend gumti rahati thi
 This turbine was very simple
 hero ke tarabine ke aadhaar par bahut se vaigyanikon ne iske vikaas ke liye anveshan kiye
 Since then turbines of various designs have been made, but they have all remained as samples
 un tarabinon ko vyavhaar main laana laabhadaayak nahin samajha gaya
 The first successful turbine was built by Giovanni Vranka in 1629 AD
 yah pehla aaveg tarabine tha
 Steam turbines are mainly of two types: is tarabine main sirf tund main bhaap prasaarit hoti he
 There is no change in the pressure of steam in passing through the moving planes, that is, the pressure of steam on the entrance and exit ends of the panels remains the same
 bhaap, gatiman falkon kii kai panktiyon se hokar, pravaahit hoti he or is pravaah main gatij urja kaa parivartan upyogi kaary ke rup main hota he
 The first successful turbine of such turbines was the de Labal's turbine, an impulse cycle over which steam escapes from the perpendiculars on the perimeter
 bhaap tund main purnat: vistaarit hoti he
 They tilt from the tangent of the Tunda Chakra at an angle from 150 to 200
 sabase chota di lavaal tarabine 5 inch vyas vaale chakra kaa banaaya gaya tha or yah 30,000 parikraman prati minute par chalaaya gaya tha
 It is suitable for low pressure steam
 is tarah ke tarabine ke falkon ke pravesh evam nikaas kone samaan hote hai
 In this type of turbine, steam is not fully dispersed in one action
 pratham sthir pankti se nikalakar bhaap gatiman falak par takaraati he
 As the steam flows through the panels, it propagates
 at: is tarah ke tarabine main falak tund kaa bhi kaam karata he
 There is some increase in the kinetic energy of steam when steam is transmitted by moving panels
 is tarah iske falak kaary karne ke saath hi saath bhaap kaa prasar bhi karte hai
 These panels simultaneously face induced and reaction forces
 isi liye is tarah ke tarabine ko 'aaveg pratikraya tarabine' kehete hai
 In fact, this nomenclature is inaccurate, as there is no single turbine called pure reaction turbine
 is tarah ke tarabine ke do mukhya udhaaharan hai:- Parson built the first impulse response turbine in 1884 AD
 isamen bhaap, tarabine chakra ke aksh ke samanaantar disha main falkon se hokar, pravaahit hoti he
 This type of turbine is also called an axis turbine
 parson tarabine main sthit or gatiman falak sarvasam banaae jate hai
 In this turbine, the vane rests in a radius direction, from which steam enters the end of the vane near the axis of the wheel and flows towards the periphery
 iske kaaran is tarabine main pravaah traigy hota he
 Apart from this, an important difference is that both types of panels move in opposite directions, which gives higher relative velocity
 saadhaarant: bhaap tarabine main agralikhit purje lage rahete hai: The most prominent in the steam turbine is its vane
 is yantra ke anya purje inhen falkon ke upyog ke liye rahete hai
 Power cannot be attained without a plank and the efficiency of the turbine is reduced due to a slight defect in the panels
 iske nirmaan ke liye aise dravyon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he jo ucchataap ke saath hi ucch pratibal kaa bhi saamana kar saken
 Non-ferrous class liquids cannot be used for the panels of modern high-temperature and high-stress turbines, as their stress capacity also decreases with heat
 aajkal iske liye avikari ispaat ke vikaas kii ore vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan kendrit he
 The ideal face is the one that is equally balanced while being of the highest efficiency
 is tarah kii avasthaa khokhale falkon dwaara praapt kii ja sakati he
 Except this, the hollow panels do not put strong stress on the cruisers
 isse ucch gati kii prapti hoti he, tathaa adhik shakti kii prapti ho sakati he
 In turbines, prone panels are also treated, leaving less stress on it
 sabhi bhaap tarabinon main falakgati bhapagati kii anupaati hoti he
 If steam is transmitted in a single step from vapor pressure to condensing pressure, the steam will become excessive at the end of the propagation
 yadi is ucch gati bhaap kaa ek phalkapankti main vyavhaar kiya jaay, to isse paribhramak gati atyadhik milegi, jo vyaavhaarik kaaryon ke liye atyant adhik he
 Many systems have been discovered to reduce this high speed of cruisers
 in sabhi pranaaliyon main kai phalkapanktiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 For this, many cruisers are bound with the help of a key
 jaise jaise gatiman phalkapanktiyon dwaara bhaap pravaahit hoti he, bhaapadaab un charnon main avashoshit ho jaati he
 This action is called 'combination'
 paribhramak gati ko kam karne ke mukhya tareeke ye hai: Separated by rows of stationary faces, the rows of moving faces remain turbine
 bhaap, vaashpitra daab se sanghanak daab tak tonti main prasaarit hokar, ucch gati praapt karti he
 The high-speed-steam then flows through the first line of moving panes, in which some of its momentum is absorbed and the rest enters the next line of stationary faces
 ye sthir falak gati ko bina parivartit kiye bhaap kii disha ko badal dete hai
 The steam then enters the second line of the moving pane
 bhaap kii gati kaa kuch or bhaag is duusari gatiman pankti main avashoshit hota he
 As the steam flows through the forward pane, the sequence keeps repeating
 is tarah ant main bhaap kii sampurna gatij urja avashoshit ho jaati he
 It consists of rows of moving panes, each followed by a row of stationary spout, in order that the turbine is held by the key on the wheel
 isamen bhaap kaa purna daabpaat cabel tonti kii pratham pankti main hi nahin hota, balki tonti kii sabhi panktiyon main samaan rup se banta rahata he
 The steam from the evaporator enters the first line of the spout, in which it is partially circulated
 tatpashchaat yah pratham gatiman phalkapankti dwaara pravaahit hoti he, jahaan isaki praaia: sampurna gatij urja avashoshit ho jaati he
 From this line, it enters the second line of the spout, where it is re-circulated partially
 isse daab main phir kuch kami ho jaati he
 The kinetic energy received by the second line of the tot is absorbed in the next moving pane
 yah kriya tab tak chalati rahati he, jab tak sampurna daabpaat tarabine main avashoshit na ho jaae
 This method of pressure combination is applied in the Rattue and Joylei turbines
 is tarah ke tarabine main uparyukt donon tareekon kaa upyog hota he
 The absolute pressure of the steam is divided into all phases and the momentum obtained in each phase is also combined
 isse yah laabh hota he ki prayek charnaa main ucch daabpaat kii prapti hoti he, jiske falswaroop kam charnon kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 That is why the size of such turbine is small
 curtis tarabine isi tarah kaa he
 Different motions of steam at the entry and exit ends of the moving pane of the turbine are represented by a velocity diagram
 ek adarsh tarabine main bhaap dwaara kiya gaya kaary rankin kaary ke baraabar hota he, arthath yah ruddhoshm ushmapat ke tulya hoga
 This work is greatly reduced by many losses in practice
 pratham haani veganiyantrak valve main hoti he, jahaan bhaap kii daab avrodh dwaara 5 se lekar 10 pratishat tak kam ho jaati he
 In high-pressure spout, there is a slight decrease in steam pressure through friction and whirlpool, but the most damage occurs in the bottleneck
 ushmiya dakshata ke liye chote chote falak upyukt nahin hote, kintu yadi falak kii oonchaai badhaai jaae to ucchdaab bhaap, bhaap kii adhik ghatna or parimit maatra ke kaaran, pratham charan kii sampurna paridhi ko dhak nahin paati he, jisase aanshik praveshhani hoti he
 The result is that the vane which is not under the influence of the steam jet keeps churning the steam filled in the casing
 iske karan pankhaa yaa vaati haani hoti he
 The percolator of the high pressure turbine also operates in a dense medium, in which it has to withstand extremely fluid barriers and this causes flash-friction-loss
 tarabine main vibhinn charnon dwaara pravaahit bhaap kii in haniyon kaa hameshaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 As the density of steam decreases, these losses also decrease
 inke alaava vikiran haani to hoti hi he
 There are also losses through friction in the bearings
 tarabine main kaary karne ke baad bhaap sanghanak main pravesh karti he evam is samay bhi isamen kuch veg hota he
 The loss of this kinetic energy is called the final or residual loss
 tarabine sanyantr kii dakshata ko badhaane ke liye is pranali kaa vyavhaar kiya jaataa he
 In this, steam A, b and c are taken out of the turbine from three points and sent to three heaters
 antim taapak se nikalakar bhaap ardravastha main jalashay main pravesh karti he, jahaan se hokar bharnajal pravaahit hota he
 Since the fill water is colder than steam, it is heated by taking heat from steam itself
 bharnajal ek taapak se duusare main, phir duusare se tisare main jaataa he
 The discharge water from the final heater becomes extremely hot, which saves heat in the evaporator
 iske kaaran tarabine sanyantr kii dakshata bad jaati he
