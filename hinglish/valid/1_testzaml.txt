 The word comes from two Greek words
 ophis kaa arth "saanp" he or phobos kaa matlab "dar" hota he
 This phobia is the most common subcategory of herpetophobia
 kuch shodhakartaaon kaa maananaa he ki yah dar vikasvaadi ho saktaa he jo hamaare purvajon dwaara viksit ek astitv tantra kaa rup letaa he
 Psychologists generally believe that the phobia is the result of a traumatic experience
 kai baar yah bhay ateet se juda hua bhi nahin hota
 Symptoms can vary widely among patients with phobias
 jis mariz ko saad phobos he use bade or vishaiylla saanp kaa saamana karne main atyant bhay mahasoos hoga
 If this phobia is even stricter, then a human snake may be afraid of even a small snake
 vah manushya kisi saanp ke chitra yaa doordarshan pe dikhaaye jane vaale kaarykram ko bhi dekhne se dar jaataa he
 It is necessary to explain the difference between Ophidiophobia and Herpetophobia because the person who is afraid of lizards or small geckos is 100% herpetophobia
 is phobos ke lakshan kai he jaise ki bhaagna, ronaa, kaanpna yaa phir saans lene main takalif mahasoos karnaa
 Ophidiophobia can be fraudulent
 kuch samay ke baad mariz ko un chizo se dar lagane lagata he jo saanp se sidhe sambandhit bhi nahin hai
 An example of this is this: Man will also be frightened by the pet shop that sells snakes in the cell
 mariz ko anya sarisrupon ke ek madhyamik dar vikaas ho saktaa he
 Example: At the age of six, Jenny and Roxy are playing in the backyard
 roxi pattiyon ke dher par kuudati he or achaanak dard main baahar chillaati he
 Jenny looks at a snake's mouth around Roxy's leg, and feels frightened to see blood coming out of her leg
 roxi aspataal main chali jaati he or samay kii ek vistaarit avadhi ke liye use vahaan rahanaa padataa he
 After the incident, she never goes to play in the yard
 vah pattiyon ke dher ke paas jane ke liye ghabara jaati he or giravat ke mausam main baahar khilne ke liye babhi manaa kar detii he
 At the age of 20, Roxy is diagnosed with Ophidiophobia, due to which he has never been afraid of a snake
 vah aakhir main paraamarsh ke liye jaati he
 Usually because of a deeply negative experience from the past or the person's mind may also feel this fear without any basis
 aparichit jaanwaron ke aasapaas rehane par yah tantrika yaa anishchit hona saamaanya he
 In addition, there have been many common myths about snakes
 mariz pareshaan bhi ho saktaa he ki vah ghinauna, ghrunit yaa daraavana hoga or ve ek constrictar dwaara kuchal diye jaaenge
 All these apprehensions are common and can be removed by gaining more personal knowledge about animals

 This therapy often shows symptoms of oophidiophobia

 In this model the intractable risk of the asset, which is often represented by 'beta' in the finance sector, is taken into account and also the expected return on the market and the expected return on the theoretical risk-free asset

 CAPM is a model for pricing a single asset or group of assets
 akeli pratibhuti ke liye, ham pratibhuti bazaar rekha tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh va systematic jokhim ke saath uske sambandh kaa prayog yah jaanane ke liye karte hai ki bazaar ke dwaara kisi ek pratibhuti kii keemat uski jokhimshrenee kii tulana main kitni nirdhaarit hogi
 The yield-risk ratio can also be calculated from the securities market line in comparison to the entire market of a single asset
 atah jaise jaise kisi sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratilabh uske beta kofishent dwaara ghatata chalaa jayega, is akeli sampatti kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat, sampurna bazaar ke pratifal-jokhim anupaat ke baraabar hota chalaa jayega
 Like this: bazaar kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat hi prabhavi taur par bazaar jokhim adhimulya / premium he or uparokt sameekaran ko punah niyojan karne par tathaa e kaa maan nikaalane par, hamen poonjigat parisampatti keemat nirdhaaran model praapt ho jaataa he
 Where: yadi isi ko jokhim premium ke drushtikon se punarlekith kiya jaae, to ham pate hai ki: That is, the "own risk premium" of an asset - the product of "market risk premium" and "beta"
 note 1: bazaar ke pratyaashit pratifal kaa anumaan praayah kisi bazaar-portpholio ke aitihaasik pratifalon ke maan kaa gyometric ausat nikaalkar lagaaya jaataa he
 Note 2: The 'risk-free rate of return' used to calculate risk is often the arithmetic average of historical rates and not the current rate
 For the full derivation see Modern portfolio theory
 The CPM can be modified to include size overload and specific risk
 yah un niveshkon ke liye mahatvapurn he jinke paas ek unnat-vishakhit portpholio nahin he
 The equation is very similar to the traditional CAPM equation "in which market risk weighting is replaced by multiplication of beta product and market risk weighting:": 5 "jahaan: The securities market line depicts the CPM formula as a graph
 x aksh par jokhim ko dikhaate hai or y aksh par pratyaashit pratilabh
 Market risk is estimated by the slope of the securities market line
 β tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh ke madhya sambandh kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha par kiya jaataa he, jo ki pratyaashit pratilabh ko β ke falan ke rup main pradarshit karata he
 The intercept is the nominal risk-free rate available in the market, while the slope is the market premium, E− Rf
 esa kaha ja saktaa he ki pratibhuti bazaar rekha as representing a single-factor model of the asset price ko dikhaati he, jabaki β se pataa chalata he ki uski bazaar main parivartanon se prabhavit hone kii sambhaavna kitni he is prakaar SML kaa sameekaran is prakaar he: It is a very important tool in such situations when it is to find out whether a asset / security will give an acceptable return compared to the risk
 akeli parisampattiyon kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha graph par kiya jaataa he
 If the mutual depiction of risk and return is above the line, it means that the security is getting cheaper and more profit can be expected on it
 yadi chithran rekha se neeche aa pade to mulya ko manhagaa samajha janaa chahie tathaa isamen utana laabh nahin milegaa jitna ki jokhim uthaaya ja rahaa he
 After knowing the expected / desired profit rate e { \ displaystyle E} using CAPM, it can be compared to the expected return rate of the asset to determine whether the investment is good or not
 iske liye hamen sampatti ke pratilabh ke swatantra anumaan kii gananaa kii aavashyaktaa hogi jo ki praayah fundamental athwa technical vishleshan, anupatik vishleshan aadi ke dwaara kii jaati he
 According to CAMP, if the estimated value is equal to the future cashflow adjusted with the rate suggested by the asset's CAPM - then the asset is meeting at the right price
 yadi anumaanit mulya siepiem moolyankan se adhik he to sampatti sasti he 
 An asset not located on the securities market line indicates a discrepancy in its value
 chunki samaybindu t { \ displaystyle t} par sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratifal e = e − p t p t { \ displaystyle E={ \ frac {e-p_{t}}{p_{t xxrep 4 } jo ki siepim dwaara sujhaaye pratifal se adhik he, to iskaa arth he ki p t { \ displaystyle P_{t}} bahut kam he, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t+1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 Using CAPM, the value of the asset p 0 { \ displaystyle P_ {0}}, can be displayed with the following linear relation: jahaan p t { \ displaystyle P_{T}} sampatti yaa portpholio kaa payoff he
 It is possible to find out by CAPM what the expected return, ie the adjustment rate, should be, taking into account the relative risk of a specific asset
 yadi beta kaa maan ek se adhik ho to iskaa arth he - ausat se adhik jokhim; ek se kam kaa arth he - ausat se kam jokhim
 Thus, a higher risk stock will have a higher beta and will be adjusted at a higher rate
 jabaki kam samvedansheel stox kaa beta kam hoga or unhen kam dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 This is in line with the prevailing informal assumption that high risk-taking investors desire higher returns
 kyonki beta kisi ek parisampatti ke jokhim kii puure bazaar jokhim ke prati samvedansheeltaa kaa paimaana he, to paribhaasha se spasht he ki bazaar jokhim kaa beta kaa maap hoga : 1
 The stock market index is used extensively as a complementary measure to measure market risk, hence its beta measure is 1
 is prakaar, ek bade or suvishakhit portpholio ke niveshak apane nivesh se bazaar kii chaal ke anusaar hi parinaamon kii apeksha kar sakate hai
 The risk in any portfolio is primarily the sum of two types of risk - systemic risk, also known as market risk or non-intangible risk, and disorderly risk known as branchial risk
 vyavasthaatmak yaa bazaar jokhim un kaarnon kii vajah se hota he jo samast nivesh vikalpon arthath puure bazaar ko prabhavit karte he
 This type of risk is difficult to control
 avyavashthaatmak jokhim vah jokhim he jo kisi vishesh pratibhuti athwa nivesh vikalp ko prabhavit karata he
 Such risk can be controlled by diversifying the investment
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i
e
 its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness—as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i
e
 less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 CAPM assumes that the risk-return ratio of an investment can be corrected, an ideal portfolio would be one with minimal risk to a defined return rate
 iske atirikt, kyonki portpholio main judane vaali har nai sampatti portpholio kaa or vishaakhan karti he, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above 
 All such optimal portfolios, i
e
, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 koi niveshak esa bhi kar saktaa he ki vah apni nidhi kaa kuch hissaa to jokhimayukt sampattiyon main nivesh kare tathaa kuch hissaa nakad bachaakar rakhe, jise jokhim rahit dar par kamai hoti rahe
 
 yahan par jokhimayukt va jokhimamukt kaa anupaat overall return ko nirdhaarit nahin karata - yah sambandh nishchit hi linear he
 In this way it is possible that a certain return can be achieved by any one of the following types: haalaanki ek nishchit pratilabh ke liye, uparokt main se koi ek vikalp hi kushal siddh hoga 
 Since the risk-free asset is not necessarily correlated with any other asset, the second option will usually have less deviation, which would make it more efficient of the two
 yah sambandh prabhavi seemaa par sthit anya portpholios ke liye bhi sahi hoga : ucch pratilabh ke saath kuch nakad- adhik kushal he bajaay - usee pratilabh dar par maatr nimna pratilabh vaale portpholio ke
 For a fixed risk-free rate, there will be only one efficient portfolio that can be combined with cash to achieve a minimum risk position for any return
 yahi market portpholio he
 All investors: dwi-beta model urdhvagami beta ko adhigami beta se bhinn karata he
 The difference between the CPM and bi-beta models is that the CPM model recognizes that the upward and the succeeding betas are the same, whereas the bi-beta model does not believe so
 asi manyata kabhi virale hi thik hoti he, atah dwi-beta model ko hi adhik upyukt mana jaataa he

 yah bhoomika mukhya rup se peter sellers dwaara nibhaai gayi he, lekin alan arqin ne bhi kii bhoomika kii he, trial of da pink panther ke flash back ke naveen sanskarnon main dainiel peakock or lakka mejzophonti ne kaam kiya he, roger moore ne or steve martin ne 2006 kii pink panther film main or baad main 2009 main isaki agali kadi main kaam kiya he
 Klauso's senior, Charles Dreyfus, was filmed in a Shot in the Dark in which he holds the position of commissioner
 vah drephus kii gadabad se itnaa vyakul rahata he ki durghatanavash apane seene main chitthee kholane vaali churi ghonpakar khud ko ghayal kar letaa he or antat khatarnaak pagal tehraaya jaataa he
 The Return of the Pink Panther features Dreyfus as Chief Inspector instead of Commissioner
 pehle kii tarah is film ke aakhir main bhi vah pagal ho jaataa he or ant main ek gaddidaar cell main band drephus ko apane pairon kii ungaliyon main pakade hue kreyan rang se diwaar par "clouso ko maar daalo" likhte hue dikhaaya jaataa he
 Like a Shot in the Dark, Dreyfus initially suffers from a variety of personal injuries accidentally killing his doctor and attempting to kill Klauso with a sniper's rifle
 da pink panther strix agen main puri tarah thik hone ke baad drephus ek paagalakhaane se reeha hone vaala hota he, lekin clouso ke pahunchane ke 5 minute ke andar vah waapas anek prakaar kii choton ko sahan karata he or phir se jaanaleva paagalpan kii purvavastha main laut jaataa he
 Dreyfus escapes from the mental asylum and forces a scientist to kidnap him and create a pernicious ray, later using the device to blackmail the rest of the world into attempting to assassinate Klauso
 strix agen ke ant main drephus vighatan karne ke liye prakat hota he, lekin baad main or bina kisi vivaran ke revange of da pink pantha ke shuru hone par vah phir se aspataal main paaya jaataa he or clouso ko galati se mrit ghoshit kar die jane par use phir se chif inspector ke rup main pad par vaapasi kii anumati di jaati he
 Herbert gives a clear vibe to his character, including Lomb fame, which occurs when he is particularly tense and fills a childlike knack when plotting to assassinate Klauso
 san of da pink panther main, drephus banakar clouso kii tarah hi uske masakhre bete jaik gambrelli se nipatata he
 Compared to his relationship with Klauso, Dreyfus is more lenient to Gambrelli
 film ke ant main, drephus clouso kii purv premika, maaria gambrali se shaadi kar letaa he
 At the wedding reception, Dreyfus is shocked to learn that Klauso and Maria actually had twins: Jack and Jacqueline Gambrelli
 2006 main da pink panther ke riboot main drephus clouso ko pralobhan ke taur par istemaal karata he jabaki vah khud aparaadh hal karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Dreyfus considers Klauso a mere idiot and never tries to kill him, while Klauso once mistakenly recognizes him and attacks his master
 baad main is film main durghatanavash drephus ko clouso kii smart car ke peeche ghasita jaataa he
 Dreyfus ends up in the hospital, where Klauso's clumsiness causes him to fall outside the window
 haalanki 2009 kii kadi main drephus ne apni pehali kii tulana main bahut choti bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Dreyfus was played by Herbert Lomb in the Blake Edwards films and Kevin Klin in the 2006 film
 2009 kii kadi main clin kii jagah yah bhoomika jon clease ne nibhaai thi
 Keto is Klauso's domestic servant and proficient in martial arts
 yah spasht nahin hota he ki vah clouso ko ek mahaan jasoos maanata hai yaa aisa kahkar keval uskaa majaak udaata he
 It is a popular joke that he is instructed to attack Klauso in order to cope with Clauso's unexpected attack and sharpen his vigilance skills
 durbhaagya se, keto in nirdeshon ko bahut gambhirtha se letaa he, baar-baar usike ghar main clouso par hamalaa karata rahata he, jiske haasyaaspad parinaam nikalate hai
 If he is restrained during such an attack, Keto emerges from the image of the attacker as a disciplinary servant
 baad kii filmon main keto kuch maamalon main clouso kii madad karata he, jinamein honkong kaa maamla bhi shaamil he
 Here, Keto wears glasses to hide himself but collides with various objects due to his ambiguity
 pehle-pahal, tuuti phooti angreji main bolne or muskuraane kii vajah se keto apane chini jati ke hone kii pushti karata he, tathaapi, revange of da pink panther main paata chalata he ki vastav main keto gairmanak angreji sahit dharapravaah angreji bolne main nipun he
 It is suggested that the two individuals have a love-hate relationship, sometimes favoring "hatred" more dominantly for keto
 revange main, keto apane guru ko mara hua maanakar clouso ke apartment ke ek hisse main gupt rup se veshyalay chalaane lagata he
 The password for the name of "inspector Clauso" was used to go to the brothel, which led to a fairly ridiculous scene when Inspector Clauso himself arrives there
 keto ne kars of da pink panther main ek or veshyalay kholaa or inspector clouso ke apartment ko sangrahalay bana diya jisamen itane saalon main inspector dwaara pahane gayi chhadmaveshon ko sangrahit kiya gaya tha
 The role of Kaito was based on Kaito, who was an assistant to The Green Hornet, played by Bruce Lee
 a shot in da dark kii suchi main bhi uske naam main "ke" kaa hi istemaal kiya gaya tha, haalanki baad ke pradarshnon main use badalakar "si" kar diya gaya tha
 Keto was starring by Burt Kwok
 punah pradarshan ke vikaas ke samay jaiki chen ko keto kii bhoomika kii peshkash kii gayi thi
 Eventually, that character was completely exterminated, thinking that the Chinese orthodoxy was politically highly inaccurate for modern audiences
 keto ko ek naye charitra gendarm gilbert pontone se badla gaya, jisaki bhoomika jine reno ne kii thi or jise inspector clouso par nazar rakhane kii jimmedaari drephus ne di thi
 Unlike the arrangement with Keto, Klauso often attacked Ponton unexpectedly, unlike Keto Ponton always won in fights
 keto par pradarshit kii gayi ladaaiiyaan pontone kii ladaaiyon ke mukaable hameshaa adhik vinaashkari or lambii hoti thi
 Drufus' assistant, François, generally viewed his master's conversation with Clauso as a gentle decoy
 francisi abhinayta andre maranne, chah panther filmon main frankvis kii bhoomika kar chuke hai or san of da pink panther main unki jagah dermot krovle ko liya gaya tha 
 baad main vah clouso kaa sahaayak ban jaataa he
 In a Shot in the Dark, Trial of the Pink Panther and Curse of the Pink Panther, he is called Sergeant François Duval, while in three episodes in 1970, he is called Sergeant François Chevalier
 2006 kii riboot main, philip gudwin ne aisa hi charitra renard ke naam se kiya

 "da phantum" ek jevar chor he, jo kai filmon main clouso kaa pramukh shatru he or janata main sar charles litan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 At every crime scene he would leave an 'introduction card': a "P" written in a distinctive style with a white glove
 pehali film main vah mukhya khalanaayak or clouso kaa shikaar hota he, lekin ant main litan clouso kii patni or ek dusht rajkumaari kii madad se clouso ko uske ateet main kii gayi dakaitiyon ke jurm main fansaa kar use asthaayee rup se jail bhej detaa he, jiskaa badla clouso sellers / edwards kii teesri film main letaa he jisamen pink panther lugaash main ek sangrahalay se chori ho jaataa he or litan iskaa mukhya sandigdh hota he
 The role was played by David Niven in the first film and by Christopher Plummer in Return
 baad kii filmon main, bujurg or kamjor niven ne choti si bhoomika kii thi, jinaki aawaaj kii dabing prabhaavvaadi rich little ne kii thi
 In these later films, Linton is believed to have married Klauso's ex-wife, although his wife's role in Return was completely different from that of Clauso prior to the events of that film
 da pink panther 2 main, hira usee ke jaise mukhya chor da tornedo dwaara churaayaa gaya tha, jisaki bhoomika johny haliday ne kii thi
 The initial title sequencing of the 1963 Pink Panther film was so successful with United Artists executives that they decided to make a series of theatrical animated shorts of title sequencing
 depatie-freleng udhyam, pehle purv warner bros dwaara chalaaya jaataa tha

 Engineering is the science and business that offers practical solutions to the problems faced by man in meeting diverse needs
 iske liye vah ganitiya, bhautik va prakritik vigyaanon ke gyanrashi kaa upyog karti he
 Engineering produces physical goods and services; Develops and controls industrial processes
 iske liye vah takneekee maanakon kaa prayog karte hue vidhiyaan, dizin or vinirdesh pradaan karti he
 'engineering' and 'engineer' originated from the French words Ingénierie and ingenieur
 ye shabd puraani french ke 'engigneor' se vyutpann hai jiskaa arth 'yuddh-mashin kaa nirmaataa'
 Although the words 'engineering' and 'engineer' in English are similar to French words in pronunciation, they originated from a completely different source
 itnaa hi nahin, inaki vyutpatti 'ingine' shabd se nahin hui he 
 The English word synonym for 'engineering' is "engineering", which derives from the Latin word "ingenium"; It means 'natural mastery'
 nikat bhootkaal main abhiyantriki shabd kaa jo arth kosh main miltaa tha vah sankshep main is prakaar bataaya ja saktaa he ki But this limited definition could no longer run
 abhiyantriki shabd kaa arth ab ek ore nabhikeey abhiyantriki ke ucch vaigyanik or pravidhik kshetra se lekar maanviya gunon se sambandhit vishyon, jaise shramik niyantran prabandheey kaaryakshmata, samay or gati kaa adhyayan ityadi, anek praayogic vigyaanon ke vistrut kshetra ko ghere hue he
 Thus it would be more appropriate to define engineering as "it is the science and art of efficient use of natural means for the physical service of man"
 aitihaasik rup se ejiniyari kaa upyog sabase pehle sena or sainik kaaryon main hua
 After this, when it started being used for civil works, the new branch was named - 'civil Engineering'
 samay ke saath ejiniyari ke anya kshetron kaa vikaas hua jinaki prakruti civil ejiniyari se bhi alag thi or unhen 'yantric ejiniyari', 'vaidyut ejiniyari' aadi naam diya gaya
 Civil engineering, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering are the traditional branches of engineering
 khanan ejiniyari, dhaatukarm or khan surveykshan kaa bhi aitihaasik mahatv he
 Architecture or architecture combines engineering and visualization
 abhiyantriki kii anek shakhaon main, jaise jaanapad athwa asainik, yantric, vidyutiya, saamudr, khanijasambandhi, rasinic, nabhikeey aadi main, kuch mahatvapurn kaary anveshan, prarachan, utpaadan, prachlan, nirmaan, vikray, prabandh, shiksha, anusandhan ityadi hai
 In order to get a proper knowledge of the vast area covered by the word engineering, it would be enlightening to give the names of the subjects under its various branches as an example
 jaanapad athwa asainik abhiyantriki ke antargat agralikhit vishay he : sadaken, rail, nautaran maarg, saamudr abhiyantriki, band, apaksharannirodh, baadh niyantran, naunivesh, pattan, jalawaahiki, jalavidyutsakti, jalavigyaan, sinchai, bhumisudhar, nadiniyantran, nagarpalika abhiyantriki, sthavar sampada, moolyankan, shilpabhiyantriki, purvanirmit bhawan, dhvanivigyaan, sanvathan, nagar tathaa gram pariyojna, jalsangrahan or vitaran, jalotsaaran, mahapvahan, kooday-kachade kaa apvahan, sanrachnik abhiyantriki, pul, kancreet, jaetvik sanrachanaayen, purvapratibalit kancreet, neenv, sanjan, bhusurvekshan, saamudrapareekshan, photography surveykshan, parivahan, bhuvigyaan, dravayantriki, pratikruti, vishleshan, mrudayantriki, jalsravi staron main chikani mitti pravisht karnaa, shailapoorit band, mrittika band, pooran kii reetiyaan, jalaashyon main jal risaav ke adhyayan ke liye vikiransheel samasthanikon kaa prayog, avsaad ke ghanatv ke liye gamma kirnon kaa prayog
 Mechanical engineering includes engineering, vibration, shipbuilding, heat transfer, refrigeration related to mechanics, thermodynamics, water vapor, diesel and tarnishing, mechanics, meteorology, instrumentation, hydropower, metallurgy, aeronautics, motorcars, etc
 vaidyut abhiyantriki main vidyudyantr, vidyut-shakti-utpaadan, sancharna tath vitaran, jalavidyut, radiosampark, vidyutmapan, vidyudadhishthapan, atyucchavriti kaary, nabhikeey abhiyantriki, electraniki hai
 Chemical engineering includes ceramic engineering, combustion, electrical chemistry, gas engineering, metallurgical and petroleum engineering, instrumentation and self-control, sorption, mixing and dissolution, propagation, design and manufacture of chemical equipment, electrical chemistry
 krishi abhiyantriki main audyogic prabandh, khani abhiyantriki, ityadi, hai
 Computer engineering electraniki athwa electronics Metal disposal engineering khanan abhiyantriki Engineering cannot be divided into narrow finite branches
 ve parasparavalambee hai
 The uninterrupted inspection of both experimental and natural phenomena and the careful use of the fruits of this type of inspection on engineering problems in such a way that the minimum expenditure of time and money gives maximum service to the society is the major method of engineering
 shuddh vaigyanik abhiyantriki kii ulajhanon ko sulajhane kii reeti vaigyanik chaahe khoj paae hon yaa na paae hon, abhiyantaa ko to apana kaary puraa karnaa hi hoga
 In such a situation, the engineer resorts to experimental analysis to some extent and finds a solution that can work in a way that, while properly managing the defense, can make his daily problems solvable
 jais-jaise sambandhit vaigyanik ansh kaa uskaa gyaan achook hota jaataa he, vah raksha ke prabandh main kami karke vyay bhi gata saktaa he
 The intellectual and functional consideration of the problems has also enabled the engineer to enter into those fields which are believed to be concerned with scientist, doctor, economist, manager, humanistic science and art from the beginning
 vishwa kaa itihaas abhiyantriki ke romance kii kahani se bharaa padaa he
 In India and abroad, visionary and determined people have done important tasks by staking everything in accordance with their dreams
 prayek abhiyantric abhiyaan main tatsambandhi vishesh samasyaayen rahati hai or inako hal karne main choti-badi donon prakaar kii pratibhaaon ko avasar miltaa he
 Engineering is an applied science
 ejiniyari main karypranali kaa mahatv pehle se he kintu ab yah or bhi adhik mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 As a result, 'systems engineering', 'knowledge engineering' etc
 have been born
 mote taur par kisi bhi ejeeniyar ko do baaten samajni hotin hai - Keeping in mind the 'requirements' and restrictions, the engineer prepares specifications, drawings, quality control to manufacture the required goods or services
 praayah ejeeniyar ke paas ek se adhik hal hote hai
 He considers diverse options
 vah vikalpon ko takneekee, aarthik tathaa suraksha kii drushti se moolyankan karata he or jo sarvaadhik upyukt parinaam detaa he use chun liya jaataa he
 Engineer work is very challenging
 galat hal kaa parinaam bahut mahangaa yaa bahut khatarnaak bhi ho saktaa he
 That is why often an engineer tests and analyzes a solution before implementing it
 iske liye vah prototip, laghu-aakaar vaale yaa sarlikrut modelon kaa prayog, simulation, dhvamsi yaa adhwansi test tathaa fatig test aadi kaa sahaara letaa he
 Since the result of a wrong solution can be severe, the engineer uses the safety multiplier when adopting pre-fabricated solutions to minimize the possibility of side effects
 kintu suraksha-gunak jitna hi adhik hoga, hal utana hi mahangaa, bada, yaa kam daksh hoga
 Russia's innovation specialist Gennrich Altshuler concluded after studying a number of patents that small-scale engineering solutions are based on agreements, while in large-scale work the engineer chooses the solution that addresses the greatest difficulty of the problem
 Do away
 computer ke aane se ejiniyari kii karypranali main moolbhoot parivartan aa gaya
 Earlier long-term calculations were done to design something, experiments were done, design reviews were done, but now computer simulations are being replaced by them
 'finite elemants methd' ke aagaman se yantriki, dravgatiki, vidyutchumbakatv, mausamavigyaan, ooshmaa-gatiki aadi ke kathin se kathin simulation kiye jane lage hai
 Computer software is being used for designing circuits, layouts of circuits, testing of circuits, etc
 sanseksh main kahen to computor kaa prayog dizin main, drafting, pareekshan main, nirmaan main or rakrakhaav main - sab jagah hone laga he
 In addition, the engineer gets help from the computer at every step - in design, production and in improving the equipment
 dizin main computer ke upyog se kaary shighrata se puraa ho jaataa he
 In many cases nowadays, modeling by computer can relieve the creation of expensive prototypes
 computor software main aajkal pehle se nirmit takneekee halon kaa database bhi uplabdh he
 Now instructions are given to numerically controlled machines, which has greatly simplified the process of production
 ise bhi dekhen - mahapariyojnaon kii suchi Most of the engineering works are huge
 ve ek vyakti dwaara yaa kuch dinon main hone vaale nahin hote
 Projects are made to do such engineering works

 pehle diavi skool, phir central skool palampur main daakhil karavaaya gaya
 Seeing the discipline of the army due to having a school in the army cantonment and hearing stories of patriotism from the father, patriotism prevailed from the time of school in Vikram
 skool main vikram shiksha ke kshetra main hi awwal nahin the, balki teble tennis main awwal darje ke khilaadi hone ke saath unamem saanskrithik kaaryakramon main bad-chadhakar bhaag lene kaa bhi jazbaa tha
 After studying for up to two years, Vikram moved to Chandigarh and started his Bachelor of Science in DAV College, Chandigarh
 is dauraan vah ensisi ke sarvshereshth cadet chune gaye or unhone ganatantr diwas kii parade main bhi bhaag liya
 He made up his mind to join the army and started preparing for CDS as well
 haalanki vikram ko is dauraan honkong main marchent navy main bhi naukari mil rahi thi jise inke dwaara thukraa diya gaya
 After graduating in science, Vikram was selected in the army through CDS
 july 1996 main unhone bhartiya sainya academy dehradun main pravesh liya
 At the end of training in December 1997, he was appointed as a lieutenant in the Army's 13 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles at Sopore, Jammu on 6 December 1997
 unhone 1999 main commando training ke saath kai prashikshan bhi liye
 On 1 June 1999, his troops were sent to the Kargil War
 hamp va raaki naab sthanon ko jeetne ke baad vikram ko captain bana diya gaya
 After this, Captain Batra's contingent got the responsibility to liberate the most important 5140 peak from the Pak army just above the srinagar-leh road
 behad durgam kshetra hone ke baavjood vikram batra ne apane saathiyon ke saath 20 june 1999 ko subah teen bajkar 30 minute par is chotii ko apane kabje main le liya
 When Vikram Batra called his victory voice through the radio from this peak 'yeh Dil Maange More', his name was not only in the army but in India
 isi dauraan vikram ke code naam shershah ke saath hi unhen ‘kargil kaa sher’ kii bhi sangya de di gai
 The next day, in the peak 5140, a photo of Vikram Batra and his team with the Indian flag appeared in the media
 iske baad sena ne chotii 4875 ko bhi kabje main lene kaa abhiyaan shuru kar diya or iske liye bhi captain vikram or unki tukdi ko jimmedaari di gayi
 He, along with his comrades, including Lieutenant Anuj Nayyar, without caring for his life, killed several Pakistani soldiers

 shookar influenza, jise ech1en1 yaa swine flu bhi kehete hai, vibhinn shookar influenza vishaanuon main se kisi ek ke dwaara failaayaa gaya sankraman he
 The swine influenza virus is any strain of influenza virus that is responsible for endemic pigs
 2009 tak gyaat es
ai
ve upabhedon main influenza si or influenza e ke upaprakaar ech1en1, ech1en2, ech3en1, ech3en2 or ech2en3 shaamil hai
 This type of influenza also affects humans and birds
 shookar influenza vishaanu kaa duniya bhar ke suaro main paaya janaa aam he
 The transmission of this virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always cause human influenza, often producing only antibodies against it in the blood
 yadi iskaa sancharan, maanav influenza kaa kaaran banataa he, tab ise zunotic shookar influenza kaha jaataa he
 Individuals who are regularly exposed to pigs are at greater risk of infection with the flu
 yadi ek sankramit suar kaa maance thik se pakaaya jaye to iske seven se sankraman kaa koi khatra nahin hota
 In the mid-20th century, it became possible to identify subtypes of influenza, which led to an accurate diagnosis of its transmission in humans
 tab se aise keval 50 sancharanon kii pushti kii gai he
 These strains of swine influenza rarely transmit from one human to another
 maanav main zunotic shookar influenza ke lakshan aam influenza ke lakshanon ke samaan hi hote hai, jaise thand laganaa, bukhaar, gale main karaash, khaansi, mansapeshiyon main dard, tej sir dard, kamajori or saamaanya bechaini
 Influenza infection in pigs can cause fever, lethargy, sneeze, cough, difficulty breathing and loss of appetite
 kuch maamalon main yah sankraman garbhpaat kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Although death usually occurs in only 1–4% of cases
 yah sankraman boar kaa vajan gata or vikaas ko prabhavit kar saktaa he jo inke palko ke aarthik nuksaan kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 The weight of an infected pig can decrease from 5 to 6 kg over a period of 3 to 4 weeks
 manushyon main shookar influenza kaa mukhya lakshan hai: - In some cases, the transmission of the swine influenza virus is possible from pigs directly to humans, in which case it is called zoonotic swine influenza
 1958 se lekar abhi tak aise sirf 50 maamle hi report huye hai, jiname se bhi sirf 6 vyakti hi mrityu kaa grass bane hai
 Of these six people, one was a pregnant woman, one had leukemia, one was suffering from Hodgkin disease and two were already healthy
 bhale hi yah pratyaksh maamle bahut kam lagen par vaastavik sankraman kii sahi dar isse kahin adhik ho sakati he, kyonki zyaadaatar maamalon main yah saamaanya rog hi prathit hota he or is kaaran ise report hi nahin kiya jaataa
 Two of the three lineage influenza viruses responsible for human influenza can also spread influenza to pigs, of which influenza a is very common but influenza c is rarely found
 abhi tak influenza bi ko siiron main nahin dekha gaya he
 The strains found in humans and pigs within influenza a and influenza c differ, although re-segregation has resulted in large-scale gene transfer across strains whether present in pigs, birds, or human species
 influenza si vishaanu, maanav or siiron donon ko sankramit karata he lekin iskaa sankraman pakshiyon main nahin hota
 In the past too, it has been transmitted between pigs and humans
 udhaaharan ke liye, influenza si ke kaaran japan or california main bacchon ke bich influenza kaa kam prabhavi prakaar failaa tha
 Influenza c has not been able to cause epidemics in humans due to its limited heterogeneous range and lack of genetic diversity
 shookar influenza, influenza e ke upaprakaar ech1en1,ech1en2,ech3en1,ech3en2, or ech2en3
 ke kaaran hota he
 Among pigs worldwide, the three influenza a virus subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H1N2 are the most common
 ech1en1 spanish flu se aayaa, jo 1918 or 1919 ke dauraan faili ek mahamari thi jisase lagbhag 5 karod log maare gaye the
 The virus that came from Spanish flu was present in pigs
 iskaa sanchalan 20 veen sadi ke dauraan manushyon main bhi hua, yadhyapi yah varsh ke us samay hota he jab prativarsh hone vaali mahamariyaan failati hai, jisase 'saamaanya' influenza or shookar influenza main antar kar paanaa kathin he
 However, cases of infection from pigs to humans are rare and 12 cases have been reported in the US since 2005
 yahe == manushyon main shookar influenza yah shookar ke dwaara manushyon main failaa
 The disease spreads more in the cold
 din or raat kaa taapmaana yadi 25C se upar ho to iske vishaanu mar jate hai

 He was soon to meet some of the musicians he would later compare to his own band; Including Trent Regner of My Life with the Thrill Kill Cult and Nine Inch Nails
 manson ne 1989 main florida main marilin manson and da spooki kids kaa gathan kiya 
 'spooki kids' ke darmyaan jordi white or astiphen gregory bear junior ke saath do 'said projects' main vah sanlagn rahe
 These projects were: Satin on Fire, a 'group of fake-christian metal musicians' in which he played bass guitar and Mrs
 Scabtree, a band he formed in collaboration with White and his then girlfriend Jessica and He played the drums
 is band kaa gathan un anubandhon se nibatane ke liye kiya gaya tha jinke antargat marilin manson ko kuch khaas klbon main pradarshan par manaahi thi
 In the summer of 1993, the band caught the attention of Trent Regner
 rejnar ne 1994 ke unke 'debyue' album, potrate of an american family ko prastut kiya or ise apane nathing records label par jari kiya
 The band began a cult follow-up that took a further turn with the 1995 release of Smells Like Children
 us EP ne band ko "sweet drims "- jo 1983 ke uridamix hit kaa ek cover tha- ke saath MTV kaa pehla bada hit pradaan kiya
 The Antichrist superstar became an even bigger success

 Geographers are of the opinion that the boundaries of Bundelkhand are clear and certain in physical and cultural form that it is a geographical region of India in which not only the basis of structural unity, geography and sociality is also the same

 Part is included

 Based on the current physical researches, Bundelkhand has been declared as a physical region and its boundaries are based on - the region which is Yamuna in the north, Vindhya Paleto ranges in the south, Chambal in the northwest and Panna in the south-east
 - Ajaygarh is surrounded by ranges, known as Bundelkhand

 However, these boundary lines can be said to be justified in terms of geostructure

 All its basis is mythological texts

 Its diverse names and their use have been in the modern era itself
 beesvin shatee ke praarambhik dashak main rhibahadur maharajasingh ne bundelkhand kaa itihaas likhaa tha
 In this, the calculation of the names of the Jagirs and their rulers under Bundelkhand was the main one
 dewan pratipaal singh ne tathaa panna darbar ke prasiddh kavi krishna ne apane sroton se bundelkhand ke itihaas likhe parantu ve vidwaan bhi saamaajik saanskrithik chetnaaon ke prati udasin rahe
 According to Dr
 Gupt, Pandit Harihar Niwas Dwivedi has discussed in detail the political, religious, cultural achievements of Bundelkhand in the history book of Central India
 is granth main kuch sthanon par bundelkhand kaa itihaas bhi aayaa he
 Pandit Gorelal Tiwari made a good effort and wrote a brief history of Bundelkhand which was different from most texts till date but he wrote the history of Bundelkhand on sociological basis only on political events
 budelkhand ke pracheen itihaas ke sambandh main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn dharna yah he ki yah chedi janapad kaa hissaa tha
 Some scholars consider Chedi district to be ancient Bundelkhand
 puranic kaal main bundelkhand prasiddh shaskaon ke adheen rahaa he jinamein chandravanshi raajaaon ke shrunkhalabaddh shasankaal kaa ullekh sabase adhik he
 In the Buddhist period, a Buddhist named Shampak built a stupa with the nails and hair of Lord Buddha in Baghuda region
 marhoot main iske avshesh vidyaman hai
 With regard to Buddhist history, the remains of that time in Bundelkhand are clear that there was no significant change in the condition of Bundelkhand during this period
 chedi kii charchaa na hona or vatsa, avanti ke shaskaon kaa mahatv darshaya janaa is baat kaa pramaan he ki chedi inamen se kisi ek ke adheen rahaa hoga
 The ancient district of Chedi is thus Bundelkhand
 itihaas sakshi he ki bharat kii aazaadee ke pratham sangram kii jwaala meerut kii chhavnee main bhadki thi
 But there is a truth missing behind these historical facts, that 15 years before the war of independence, Meerut started a revolution in Dharmanagri Chitrakoot of Bundelkhand
 pavitra mandakini ke kinare gokshi ke khilaaf ekajute hui hindu-muslim birdari ne mau tehsil main adaalat lagaakar paanch firangi afasaron ko faansee par lataka diya
 After this, whenever the British or any of their hangers tried to cheat in the pride of the Bundelas, they were beheaded
 is kranti ke nayak the aazaadee ke pratham sangram kii jwaala meerut ke sidhe-saadhe harbole
 The 'ghaghra platoon' of Burkhanshini women was also instrumental in taking forward the tales of struggle
 aazaadee ke sangharsh kii pehali mashaal sulgaane vaale bundelkhand ke ranbankure itihaas ke pannon main jagah nahin paa sake, lekin unki shoorveerta kii tasdik firangi afasar khud kar gayi hai
 There is a story buried in the Banda Gazette written by the British authorities, which is known by very few people
 gajetir ke panne palatney par maaloom hua ki varsh 1857 main meerut kii chhavnee main firangiyon kii fouj ke sipaahi mangal pandeya ke vidroh se bhi 15 saal pehle chitrakoot main kranti kii chingaari bhadak chuki thi
 Actually, British officers used to slaughter cows on the banks of the holy Mandakini river in Dharmanagari at that time of the past
 gaumance ko bihar or bengal main bhejkar vahaan se evaj main rasad or hathiyaar mangaye jate the
 The local people were distracted by the killing of a second faith, ie the cow dynasty, on the banks of Mandakini, a symbol of faith, but the tongue was closed due to the fear of the Firangi
 kuch logon ne himmat dikhaate hue maratha shaskaon or mandakini paar ke ‘nayaa gaanv’ ke choube raajaaon se fariyaad lagaayi, lekin donon shaskaon ne angrejon kii mukhaalafat karne se inkaar kar diya
 The request went in vain, as a result a flame of vengeance flared inside the chest
 isi dauraan gaanv-gaanv ghoomane vaale harbolon ne gaukashi ke khilaaf logon ko jaagrit karte hue ekajute karnaa shuru kiya
 Then on the sixth day of June in the year 1842, he did not expect any
 hajaaron kii sankhya main nihathe mazdooron, naujavaanon or burkanashin mahilaon ne mau tehsil ko gherkar firangiyon ke saamne baghawat ke naare buland kiye
 The special thing was that hindu-muslim fraternity had equal participation in this movement against Gaukashi
 tehsil main goron ke khilaaf aawaaj buland hui to bundelon kii bhujaaen fadakane lageen
 After seeing the British officers were hostage, after this, a 'public court' was put under the tree and five British officers were hanged after trial
 janakranti kii yah jwaala mau main dafan hone ke bajaay rajapur bazaar pahunchi or angrej afasar khaded diye gayi
 Seeing the beauty of time, the landlords of Merca and Samagra also jumped into the movement
 do din baad 8 june ko baberu bazaar sulagaa to vahaan ke thanedaar or tehseeldaar ko jaan bachaakar bhaagna padaa
 Along with expelling the British from Joharpur, Palani, Bisalpur, Semri, the revolutionaries in the office of Tindwari Tehsil burnt government records and looted three thousand rupees
 aazaadee kii jwaala bhadakne par gori hukumat ne apane pitthu shaskaon ko hukum jari karte hue krantikariyon ko kuchalane ke liye kaha
 On this decree, Panna Naresh sent a thousand soldiers, a cannon, four elephants and fifty bulls, the queen of Chhatarpur and the king of Gaurihar as well as the army of the king of Ajaygarh had also traveled to Chitrakoot
 duusari ore banda chhavnee main dubake firangi afasaron ne banda nawab se jaan kii guhaar lagaate hue bivi-bacchon ke saath pahunch gayi
 Here to suppress the rebellion, all the soldiers of the army of Indian kings who reached banda-chitrakoot started to step in with the agitators
 nattejey main utsaahi krantikariyon ne 15 june ko banda chhavnee ke prabharee mi
 kakrel ko pakadaney ke baad gardan ko dhad se alag kar diya
 After this, to end the awe of the British from inside Awam, roam the streets of Banda with a severed head
 kakrel kii hatya ke do din baad rajapur, mau, banda, darsenda, tarauhaan, badausa, baberu, pailaani, simauni, sihunda ke bundelon ne yuddh parishad kaa gathan karte hue bundelkhand ko aaazaad ghoshit kar diya
 Convener of "bundelkhand Unified Party" Sanjay Pandey says that when the British officers themselves have written about this revolution, then why did Indian historians not give these facts a place in the pages of history? When asked the truth it was a real mass movement Because there was no leader in it but the general public was the agitator, so it is not possible to ignore the struggle of the Bundelas to find a place in history

 Sahih al-bukhari, also known as Bukhari Sharif
 sunni islam ke qutub al-sittaah main se ek he
 The traditions, or hadiths of these Prophet were collected by the Muslim scholar Muhammad al-bukhari
 is haddees kaa sangrah 846 / 232 hijri ke aasapaas puraa ho gaya tha
 Sunni Muslims consider Right Bukhari and Right Muslim as the two most trusted collections
 zadi shiya musalamaanon dwaara bhi ek pramanik haddees sangrah ke rup main mana or iskaa upyog bhi kiya jaataa he
 In some groups, it is considered the most authentic book after the Quran
 arabi shabd "sahih" kaa matlab pramanik yaa sahi kaa arth detaa he
 The right al-bukhari, along with the right Muslim, is called "sahihain"
 Others Others: ebn al-salaah ke anusaar, aamtaur par sahi al-bukaari ke naam se jane jaani vaali kitaab kaa vaastavik sheershak he: "al-jami 'al-sahih al-musnad al-mukhtsar min umuri rasulillaahi va sunnihi va ayyamihi" he
 There is a word-to-word translation of the title: a collection of authentic hadiths in relation to matters connected with the Prophet, his practices, and his period
 ebn hajar al-asakalani ne usee sheershak kaa ullekh kiya, jisamen umoor shabd ko haddees shabd se badal diya gaya tha
 al-bukhari traveled widely in Abbasid Khilafat from the age of 16, collecting traditions he believed to be trustworthy
 yah bataaya gaya he ki al-bukhari ne apane is sangrah main lagbhag 600,000 ullekhon ko ikatta karne main apane jivan ke 16 saal samarpit kiye the
 The sources differ on the exact number of hadiths in Bukhari's right, depending on whether the hadith is believed to be a description of the Prophet tradition
 visheshgyon ne, saamaanya rup se, 7,397 hadison ko purna-isnad hadison kii sankhya kaa anumaan lagaaya he, or unhi hadison main punrariti yaa vibhinn sanskarnon ke vichaaron ke bina, paigambar ke hadison kii sankhya lagbhag 2,602 tak kam ho gai he
 At that time, Bukhari saw and examined the Muttaluk earlier works of Hadith
 ur puri chaan been ke baad jise sahih or hasan mana jayega unheen ko sangrah kiya
 And many of them also include Daif or Zaif Hadith
 is se saafe zaahir hota he ki inako haddees ko sankalit karne main apni ruchi thi or unhon ne is ko kiya bhi
 To further strengthen his resolve, he was told by his teacher, the Hadith scholar Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-hanthali, "we were with Ishaq ibn Rahwayh, who said, 'if only you would compile a book of authentic stories of the Prophet
 ' yah suzav mere dil main rahaa, isliye maine sahih ko sankalit karnaa shuru kiya
 "bukhari also said," i saw the Prophet in a dream and it seemed that i was standing in front of him
 mere haath main ek pankhaa tha jisase main unki raksha kar rahaa tha
 When i asked some dreamers, they told me that "you will save them from lies"
 "yahi vah he jo mujhe sahih kaa utpaadan karne ke liye amada kiya tha
 " is pustak main islam ke uchit maargdarshan pradaan karne main jivan ke lagbhag sabhi pahaluon ko shaamil kiya gaya he jaise prarthana karne or paigambar mohammad dwaara ibaadaton ke anya kaaryon kii vidhi
 Bukhari completed his work around 846 / 232 Hijri, and spent the last twenty-four years of his life visiting other cities and scholars, teaching the Hadith he had collected
 bukhari ke har shahar main, hajaaron log mukhya masjid main ikatthe hote hai taaki un se sangrah kii gayi in paramparaon ko pard saken
 In response to Western academic doubts as to the actual date and author of the book named after him, scholars point out that the noted Hadith scholars of the time, Ahmed ibn Hanbal, Yahya ibn Mayn, and Ali ibn al-madini, wrote Accepted the authenticity of the book and the collection gained instant fame
 yahan tak prasidd hua ki lekhak kii mrityu ke baad log is kitaab ko kisi sanshodhan kiye maanane lage or yah ek aitihaasik record ban gai
 During this period of twenty-four years, al-bukhari made minor modifications to his book, particularly the chapter title
 prayek sanskaran kaa naam iske varnanakarta dwaara kiya jaataa he
 According to Ibn Hajar al-asaklani in his book Nukta, the number of hadiths is the same in all editions
 bukhari ke ek bharosemand chaatr al-phirabari dwaara varnit sanskaran sabase prasiddh he
 al-khatib al-baghdadi in his book History Baghdad quotes Firaibari as saying: "seventy thousand people listened to Sahih Bukhari with me"
 phirabari sahi al bukhari ke ekmaatr failaane vaale nahin the
 Ibrahim ibn Maql, Hamma ibn Shaker, Mansoor Barduzi and Hussain Mahmili taught and spread this book to the next generations
 aisi kai kitaaben hai jo matbhed rakhti hai, jin main sab se aham fatah al-baari he
 Noted Islamic scholar Amin Ahsan Islahi lists three outstanding qualities of the rightful al-bukhari: ebn al-salaah ne kaha: "sahih ko lekhak banane vaale pehle bukhari, abu abd allaah mohammad ebn ismail al-juphy the, iske baad abu al-usan muslim ebn al-anjaj ek-naisaburi al-kushaayri the, jo unke chaatr the, saajha karte the ek hi shikshak
 These two books are the most authentic books after the Quran
 al-shafii ke bayaan ke liye, jinhone kaha, "mujhe malik kii kitaab kii tulana main gyaan yukt pustak kii jaankaree nahin he," - anya ek alag shabd ke saath iskaa ullekh kiya - unhone bukhari or musalmaan kii kitabon se pehle yah kaha
 Bukhari's book is both more authentic and more useful for both
 " Ibn Hajar al-asqlani quoted Abu Jafar al-uquila as saying, "bukhari wrote Sahih, he read it to Ali ibn al-madini, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Yahya ibn Mayn as well as others
 unhone ise mana ek acha prayaas or chaar haddees ke apwaad ke saath isaki pramanikta kii gavaahi di gai
 al-aquila then stated that Bukhari was indeed correct about those four hadiths
 " ebn hajar ne tab nishkarsh nikaala, "or ve vastav main pramanik hai
 " ebn al-salaah ne apane mukddima ebn al-ilaala fee 'ulam al-aadid main kaha : "yah hamen bataaya gaya he ki bukhari ne kaha he,' maine al-jami pustak main shaamil nahin kiya he ' jo pramanik he or maine kiya alpsankhyak ke liye anya pramanik haddees shaamil nahin he
 '"furthermore, al-dhahabi said," Bukhari was heard saying,' i have memorized one hundred thousand authentic hadiths and two hundred thousand which are less than authentic
 ' " In relation to female leadership, at least one famous hadith in Bukhari was written based on its content and its hadith narrator, which some authors did not consider authentic

 Explanation is given in the Hadith reported by Hazrat Aisha in the Imam Jarkashi Hadith collection: “


 He came to our house when the Prophet was in the middle of the sentence
 usne iske bare main keval ant suna
 What the Prophet said: 'allah rejects the Jews; They say three things bring bad luck: home, women and horses
 " 'is maamle main sawaal uthaaya gaya he ki bukhari main anya haddees ko apurna or kami kii uchit sandarbh soochna mili he yaa nahin The correct Bukhari Prophet's medicine and methods of treatment and hijama which are likely to be unscriptural have been introduced

 Ibn al-salah also said: "there are 7,275 hadiths in the book of Hadith, Sahih, in which some hadiths are repeated again and again
 aisa kaha gaya he ki baar-baar doharaai gayi hadison ko chhodkar yah sankhya 2,230 he
 "it is referring to those hadiths that are Musnad, originating from Muhammad and authenticated by the Companions

 Thereafter, knot suppressor genes are inactivated in cancer cells, resulting in a loss of normal function of those cells, such as correct DNA replication, control of the cell cycle, orientation and adhesion within tissues, and the immune system

 ye kramshah utak vigyaan or sthaan hai
 Common category examples include: in main se adhikansh ganthen bacchon main aam hai
 The names of dormant knots typically use words such as -carcinoma, -sarcoma or -blastoma as suffixes, with the Latin or Greek word for organ of origin as the root word
 udhaaharan ke liye, yakrut kaa karkat hepetocarcinoma kehalaata he; vasa koshikaon kaa karkat liposarcoma kehalaata he
 For common cancers, the English name of the organ is used
 udhaaharan ke liye stan cancer kaa sabase saamaanya prakaar stan kaa vahini parak carcinoma yaa mameri dakatal carcinoma kehalaata he
 Here the adjective ducktail is used to refer to the cancer seen in the microscope, which is similar to normal breast vessels

 Cancer is a class of different diseases that vary widely in their causes and biology
 koi bhi jeev, yahaan tak ki paudhon, main bhi karkat cancer ho saktaa he
 Almost all cancer cancers grow slowly, cancer and cancer cells and its daughter cells cause an error
 koi bhi cheez jo pratikruti karti he sambhavatya trutiyon se peedit ho sakati hai 
 yadi truti sudhaar or rokthaam thik prakaar se na kiya jaye trutiyaan bani rahengi or putree koshikaon ko bhi sthanantarit ho sakati hai
 Generally, the body tries to avoid against cancer through several methods, such as: apoptosis, accessory molecules, possibly chronicity, etc
 haalanki ye truti sudhaar vidhiyaan chote myanon main aksar asafal ho jaati hai, vishesh rup se aise vaataavaran main jahaan trutiyon ke utpann hone or badhane kii sambhaavnaaen adhik hoti hai
 For example, such an atmosphere may contain disruptive elements known as carcinogens
 yaa aavadhik chot ho sakati he, yaa vaataavaran jisamen koshikaayen apane astitv ke liye viksit nahin hui hon, jaise hypoxia 
 In this way, cancer is a progressive disease and these progressive errors keep accumulating in the cell gradually until the cell present in the animal starts to work in opposite to its functions
 ve trutiyaan jo karkat kaa kaaran hoti hai, aksar swa-pravardhansheel hoti hai, antat ek ghaateey dar par badhati hai
 for example: is prakaar se karkat aksar kuch trutiyon ke kaaran ek shrinkhalaa abhikriya ke rup main visphotit hota he, ye trutiyaan sanyukt hokar adhik gambhir trutiyaan banaati hai
 Errors that cause more errors are effectively the root cause of cancer and, at the same time, the reason that cancer treatment is very difficult: even after killing all of the cancer's 10,000,000,000 cells
 , Only 10 cells of them can do their replication or send the error-causing signals to other cells then the process starts again

 Fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamine and multicomponent hydrocarbons, are found in tobacco smoking
 Tobacco is responsible for one in three cancer deaths in the developed world, and about one in five deaths worldwide
