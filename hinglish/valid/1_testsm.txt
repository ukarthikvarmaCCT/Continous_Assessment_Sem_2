 a short booklet titled "essential Elements of Psychology" by Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was also published in 1912 which was a collection of his lectures given in class

 He used to come 20 minutes late to class and leave ten minutes earlier
 inkaa kahana tha ki kaksha main inhen jo vyaakhyaan dena hota tha, vah 20 minute ke paryaapt samay main sampann ho jaataa tha
 Even after this, he remained the beloved and respected teacher of the students

 a new post of Vice President was created under the Constitution
 nehru ji ne is pad hetu radhakrishnan kaa chayan karke punah logon ko chaunkaa diya
 He wondered why no Congress party politician was elected for the post
 uparashtrapati ke rup main radhakrishnan ne rajyasabha main adhyaksh kaa padbhaar bhi sambhaala
 In 1952, he became the Vice President of India
 baad main pandit nehru kaa yah chayan bhi sarthak siddh hua, kyonki uparashtrapati ke rup main ek gaiyr raajnneetijna vyakti ne sabhi raajnneetigyon ko prabhavit kiya
 All the members of Parliament appreciated him for his work

 But the way to realize this dream of former Prime Minister late Rajiv Gandhi, Congress President Sonia Gandhi has made up her mind and has issued a whip to ensure the imperative to vote in favor of women reservation to her Congress mps
 It is that even if the top male leaders of the Congress party are not opposed to this bill within themselves, Sonia Gandhi The intention at the moment it does not appear after detecting that Congress leaders after the passage of the Bill in the Rajya Sabha will now open your tongue against it in Parliament
 baat jab desh kii aadhi aabaadi ke aarakshan kii ho to bhartiya janata party bhi congress se lakh matbhed hone ke baavjood khud ko mahila aarakshan vidheyak se alag nahin rakh sakati lihaaja party main kai saansadon se matbhedon ke baavjood bhaajapa bhi philhal is vidheyak ke paksh main khadi dikhaai de rahi he
 However, there is no doubt that the manner in which the nuclear agreement between India and US during the previous government of Manmohan Singh proved to be a big trouble for the Manmohan government and on the same issue, the Left parties even supported the UPA government
 was drawn
 thik waisi hi sthiti mahila aarakshan vidheyak ko lekar ek baar phir dekhi ja rahi he
 But like last time, this time also the intentions of the Congress are very clear
 khabar he ki ek varisht kendriya mantri ne sonia gandhi se yah poocha ki unhen loksabhaa main mahila aarakshan kii manjuuri chahie yaa ve sarkaar bachaana chahengi
 On this, Sonia Gandhi has also made it clear that she needs approval for women's reservation
 ukt vidheyak ko lekar desh kii sansad main pichley dinon kya kuch ghatit hua yah bhi puraa desh va duniya dekh rahi he
 The seven mps of the Rajya Sabha had to be suspended from the House in order to climb up to the Speaker's motion and tear up the bill and hurt the dignity of the House
 rashtriya janata dal, samaajawaadee party va lok janashakti party ke in saansadon dwaara mahila aarakshan vidheyak ke vartmaan swaroop ko lekar jo hangaamaa khadaa kiya ja rahaa he vah bhi haasyaaspad he
 The leaders of these parties are demanding that reservation should be made for women of Dalits, backward castes and minorities only in the quota of 33 percent women reservation
 ab yah shagufa maatr shagunpha hi he yaa phir in partiyon ke is kadam main koi hankinkat bhi he yah jaanane ke liye ateet main bhi jhaakna naruri hoga
 When the advocates of 33 percent general reservation for women, such as Lalu Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Sharad Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan, ask the opponents of the present form of the bill, that you have since your political parties came into existence Name any five mps, mlas or Legislative Council members who you have mentioned as Dalits, Backward and Minorities
 Being in the candidate made a member of the House
 iske jawaab main in netaaon ke paas kehane ko kuch bhi nahin he
 It is clear from this that their ruckus in the name of Dalits, backward castes and women of minority communities is only a ruckus and not a reality
 darasal jo netaa mahila aarakshan vidheyak kaa virodh jati ke aadhaar par kar rahe hai unki majaburi yah he ki unke haathon se pichhadi jatiyon va alpsankhyakon ke vah vot bank to se khisak rahe hai jo unhen satta me laane main sahyogi hua karte the
 Therefore, this leader who is opposing the Women's Reservation Bill in the name of giving extra reservation to the women of backward and minorities is really like playing two birds with one stone
 in jatiyon ke paksh main apni aawaaj buland kar yah netaa jahaan apane khiskate janaadhar ko pun: bachaana chaah rahe hai vahiin inaki yah koshish bhi he ki kisi prakaar unke virodh va hangaame ke chalate yah vidheyak paarit hi na hone paae
 And thus the supremacy of men in politics remains undone
 mahila aarakshan vidheyak se judi tamaam or aisi sachchaiyaan hai jinhen ham nazarandaaj nahin kar sakate
 However, this subject is generally being expressed by women
 aarakshan kii khabar ne desh kii adhikansh mahilaon main josh bhar diya he
 But among them, there are some educated and well-off women who are saying that women's reservation is not necessary and only Shoshabaji
 aisi mahilaon kaa tark he ki mahila shashaktikaran kaa upaay maatr aarakshan hi nahin he
 Apart from this, there can be other measures that can bring women at par with men
 udhaaharan ke taur par mahilaon hetu ni:shulk anivaary shiksha kaa praavdhaan kiya janaa chahie
 Immediate and justifiable decisions in sexual harassment crimes against women and dowry related crimes should be made at the earliest and more stringent laws should be enacted for this
 kanya bhrun hatya ko tatkaal puure desh main pratibandhit kiya janaa chahie tathaa iske liye bhi or sakht kanoon bhi banaae jane kii jarurat he
 In sports, equal arrangements should be made for women
 sarkari evam gaiyr sarkari naukariyon main bhi mahilaon ko aarakshan diya janaa chahie
 And since this reservation has to be given for half the population of the country, it should not be 33 percent but 50 percent
 vruddh ,biimaar tathaa gharelu hinsa kii shikaar mahilaon kii sahaayta va inhen aashray diye jane kii vyavastha honi chahie
 Bank loans should be provided on priority basis to women for business
 lit papad jaisi gram udyog sanstha se sikh lete hue sarkaar ko bhi isi prakaar ke anek mahila pradhan pratishthan rashtriya str par sanchalit karne chahie
 The question remains that even if the Women's Reservation Bill is presented in Parliament for participation in the power of women, there is no doubt that the reserved participation of women in politics will definitely reduce the corruption in politics
 sansad va vidhansabhaon main aamtaur par dikhaai dene vaale updravpurn drishyon main bhi lagbhag 33 pratishat kami aane kii sambhaavna he
 Bundles of notes will also be tossed less than before in Parliament
 parantu yah sab tabhi sambhav ho sakegaa jabaki desh kii loksabhaa main ukt vidheyak pesh hone kii naubat aa sake or uske pashchaat loksabhaa is vidheyak ko do-tihaai maton se paarit bhi kar de
 And since it is a constitution amendment bill, it will be necessary to pass this bill in more than half of the country i

 a stop loss is the value of a stock or index at which the transaction is closed after reaching it
 vittiya bazaar main kisi bhi kharide jane vaale share ke bhav ke upar jane kii sambhaavna bhi hoti he or neeche jane kii ashanka bhi bani rahati he
 If the stock price starts to fall, then it can reach quite low
 atev share kray karte samay hi iske stop los ko tay kiya jaataa he
 For example, if a share of 100 rupees is taken, then it should be sold when it comes to 95 or 90 rupees
 isse adhik neeche bhav pahunchane par bhi ise kis keemat tak rakhana he, yaa bechnaa he; yahi stop los hota he
 According to the experts, it is more beneficial to decide about stop loss while buying shares
 yah suvidha brokar ke computer main uplabdh hoti he
 Successful and experienced stock investors always keep an eye on return estimates and stop losses
 stop los ko stop order bhi kaha jaataa he
 In the table of the rising price data of a stock, the place where the share price crosses the trend line and goes down, is the stoploss of that stock
 isi tarah mandi ke saudon main bhav jahaan trend line ko katkar upar aa jaae, vahiin un saudon kaa stoplos hota he
 When stoploss is increased or decreased with sentiment, it is called trailing stoploss
 ye kai prakaar ke hote hai: The graph of the price of a stock ascending in the market from which it turns downward, the position or position is called the top or the top
 isi tarah girte hue bhav main graph jahaan se chadhana shuru kar detaa he, vahiin bottm kehalaata he
 Top and bottom have great importance in technical analysis
 yadi kisi chart main har aglaa top or bottm kramash: pichley top or bottm se ooncha ho, to share yaa suchakank teji ke daur main kehalaata he
 Similarly, if every next top and bottom in a chart is below the previous top and bottom respectively, then the stock or index is considered in a recession
 share ke bhav ke baar chart main kisi share ke har din ke ucchtam or nunatam bhaavon ko ek sidhi rekha se jodne par jo rekha milti he, rujhaan rekha yaa trend line kehalaati he
 The falling stock's trend line draws the line from the highest price of that stock, while the line is drawn from the lowest price to draw the trend line of the rising stock
 behatar parinaam hetu kisi ek din ke ucchtam yaa nunatam bhav kii jagah kai dinon ke ucchtam yaa nunatam bhaavon ke ghanatv vaale kshetron se rekha khinchi jaati he
 The trade line is extremely helpful for investors, also known as the trend is the best friend in English
 trend tuutane kaa arth hota he ki share kii chaal kii disha badalane vaali he
 That is, if the stock price is falling and the prices of the stock suddenly start coming upwards after cutting the trend line drawn from above, then it should be understood that the edge is going to start
 iske ulat agar chadhate hue share yaa index ke nichle bhav se khinchi gai rujhaan rekha keemton ke upar jane lage, to teji ke saude kaat lene chahie
 By tracking returns and estimating returns, profit-recovery is simplified when the investor is informed of financial goals
 yah is nirnay ko aasaan banaata he ki niveshak ko kisi kaarobaar vishesh main nivesh karnaa laabhprad he yaa nahin
 According to experts, if the return-risk ratio is not in favor then it should not be traded
 jaise, yadi 100 rupye ke lakshya ke saath 90 rupye kaa koi share kharidte hai or stop los 75 rupye se neeche he to ritern-jokhim anupaat paksh main nahin he
 In this case, after selling the shares at the target price, they are willing to take a loss of Rs 15 per share for an expected profit of Rs 10 per share
 is tarah se ritern kii tulana main jokhim adhik he or samajhadaari he ki is share main paisa na lagaaein
 Thus stop loss information is very helpful in deciding to invest
 adhikansh vishleshkon ko lagata he ki trederon ko jokhim sahane kii kshamta ke aadhaar par stop los tay karnaa chahie

 The United Nations Population Fund has designated October 12, 1999 as the deadliest day on which the world's population reached 6 billion
 yah 1987 main vishwa jansankhya ke 5 arab tak pahunchne ke lagbhag 12 saal baad or 1993 main vishwa jansankhya ke 5
5 arab tak pahunne ke 6 saal baad hua
 However, in some countries like Nigeria and China, the population is not even known to be close to a million, so there is a lot of error in such estimates
 1700 veen shatabdi ke baad jaise jaise audyogic kranti tej gati se badhati gayi vaise vaise jansankhya vruddhi main bhi kaafii badhat dekhne ko mili
 pichley 50 varshon main jansankhya vruddhi kii dar or bhi zyaada tej huyi he or isaki mukhya vajah he chikitsa jagat main huyi taraqqi or krishi utpaadakta main hone vaali mahatvapurn badhat, khaas taur se varsh 1960 se 1995 ke bich harith kranti ke kaaran hui pragati
 san 2007 main sanyukt raashtra jansankhya prabhag ne anumaan lagaaya ki varsh 2055 main duniya kii aabaadi 10 arab ke aankade ko paar kar jaaegi
 bhavishya main, ummid he ki duniya kii aabaadi main vruddhi shikhar tak pahonchegi or uske baad aarthik kaarnon, swasthya chintaaon, bhoomi ke andhadhundh prayog or uski kami or paryaavarniya sankaton ke kaaran aabaadi kam hone lagegi
 is baat kii bhi 85% sambhaavna he ki is sadi ke ant se pehle duniya kii aabaadi badhani band ho jaayegi
 60% sambhaavna he ki duniya kii jansankhya varsh 2100 se pehle 10 arab logon se adhik nahin hogi or kareeb 15% sambhaavna he ki sadi ke ant main vishwa kii jansankhya aaj kii tithi main vishwa kii kul jansankhya se kam ho jaaegi
 vibhinn kshetron ke liye, sarvaadhik jansankhya ke tarikh or aakaar main kaafii bhinnata hogi
 Population control is generally considered to reduce population growth by reducing birth rate
 pracheen greece dastavejon main mili uttarjivita ke record jansankhya niyantran ke abhyaas evam prayog ke sabase pehle udhaaharan hai
 This includes the colonization movement, in which Greek outposts were built around the Mediterranean and Black Sea in order to provide sufficient space for the greater population of individual states to settle
 kuch unani nagar rajyon main jansankhya kam karne ke liye shishu hatya or garbhpaat ko protsaahan diya gaya
 An important example of compulsory population control is the People's Republic of China's one-child policy in which having more than one child is considered very bad
 is niti ke parinaam swarup jabaran garbhpaat, jabaran nasbandi or jabaran shishu hatya jaise aaropon ko badhaava mila
 The birth of only 100 girls as compared to 114 boys in the country's sex ratio shows that infanticide is usually done according to gender choice
 yah baat upyogi hogi agar prajnan niyantran karne ko vyakti ke vyaktigat nirnay ke rup main or jansankhya niyantran ko sarkari yaa rajya str kii jansankhya vruddhi kii viniman niti ke rup main dekha jaae| prajnan niyantran kii sambhaavna tab ho sakati he jab koi vyakti yaa dampati yaa parivaar apane bachche paidaa karne ke samay ko ghataane yaa use niyantrit karne ke liye koi kadam uthaaye| ansale kole dwaara die gaye sanrupan main, prajnan main lagaataar kami karne ke liye teen purvapratibandh die gaye hai: prajnan ke maanya tatv ke rup main pariklit chunaav ko sweekruti, kam kiye gaye prajnan se gyaat laabh or niyantran ke prabhavi tareekon kaa gyaan or unka prayog karne kaa kushal abhyaas
 prakritik prajnan par vishwaas karne vaale samaaj ke vipareet wo samaaj jo ki prajnan ko simit karne kii ichha rakhte hai or aisa karne ke liye unke paas sansaadhan bhi uplabdh hai
 They can use these resources to delay childbirth, differentiate between childbirths, or prevent their births
 sambhog main deree, yaa garbhanirodh karne ke prakritik yaa kritrim tareeke ko apnaanaa zyada maamalon main vyaktigat yaa paariwarik nirnay hota he, iskaa rajya niti yaa saamaajik taur par hone vaale anumodanon se koi sarokaar nahin hota he
 On the other hand, those individuals who can control themselves in terms of reproduction, such people can further accelerate the process of childbirth or make it successful
 saamaajik str par, prajnan main giravat hona mahilaon kii babbti hui dharmanirpeksh shiksha kaa ek anivaary parinaam he
 However, fertility control from moderate to high levels does not necessarily involve reducing fertility rates
 yahaan tak ki jab aise alag alag samaaj kii tulana ho jo prajnan niyantran ko acchhee khaasi tarah apana chuke he, to baraabar prajnan niyantran yogyata rakhane vaale samaaj bhi kaaphi alag alag prajnan str de sakate hai, jo ki is baat se judaa hota he ki chote yaa bade parivaar ke liye yaa bacchon kii sankhya ke liye vyaktigat or saanskrithik pasand kya he
 Unlike fertility control, which is primarily an individual-level decision, the government may make several attempts to control the population, such as by increasing people's access to contraceptive devices, or by other population policies and programs
 As defined above, "population control" is not involved in implementing 'population control' at the government or social level , as a state can control the population of a society even though the use of reproductive control in society is very less Do it
 jansankhya niyantran ke ek pahalu ke rup main aabaadi badhaane vaali nitiyon ko angeekrut karnaa bhi zaruri he or zaruri he ki ye samajha jaae kii sarkaar jansankhya niyantran ke rup main sirf jansakhya vruddhi ko rokna nahin chaahati| jansankhya vruddhi ko protsaahit karne ke liye sarkaar na keval apravas kaa samarthan kar sakati he balki janm samarthak nitiyon jaise ki kar laabh, vittiya puraskaar, chhuttiyon ke dauraan vetan dena jari rakhane or bacchon ki dekh rekh main madad karne dwaara bhi logon ko atirikt bachche paidaa karne ke liye protsaahit kar sakati he
 For example in recent years such policies were adopted in France and Sweden
 jansankhya vruddhi badhane ke isi lakshya ke saath, kai baar sarkaar ne garbhpaat or janm niyantran ke aadhunik sadhano ke prayog ko bhi niyantrit karne kii koshish kii he
 An example of this is the ban in Romania in 1966 for contraceptive means and abortion on demand
 paristhitiki main, kai baar jansankhya niyantran puri tarah sirf parbhakshan, beemaari, paraseete or paryaavaran sambandhi karkon dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In a continuous environment, population control is controlled only by the availability of food, water and security
 ek nishchit kshetra adhiktam kul kitni prajatiyon yaa kul kitne jivit sadasyon ko sahaara de saktaa he use us jagah kii dhaaran kshamta kehete hai
 Sometimes it also involves human impact on plants and animals
 kisi vishesh ritu main bhojan or aashray kii zyada uplabdhta vaale kshetra kii ore pashuon kaa palaayan jansankhya niyantran ke ek prakritik tareeke ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 The area from which the migration takes place is left for the next time to raise or produce food supplies for a large group of animals
 apravasbhi dekhen India is another example where the government has taken several measures to reduce the population of the country

 khagoleey pindon ke adhyayan main photography kaa vishesh mahatvapurn sthaan he
 There are two reasons for this - one is that due to the ability of the photopius to receive light, a very clear image of even the very light objects can be obtained by giving sufficient exposure
 doosraa yah ki photograph dwaara praapt chitra sthaayee hote hai or unhen sookshm adhyayan ke hetu surakshit rakhaa ja saktaa he
 It would not be an exaggeration if it is said that in the absence of the art of photography, the development of modern astrology would never have been possible so far

 On the plaque containing that emulsion, he obtained a clear picture of the Sun in the infrared region of the spectrum
 abni kaa avishkaar khagoleey photography ke kshetra main sachmuch ek kranti thi
 By this, Dr
 Gauld took pictures of many major pair wires of the Southern Hemisphere in the year 1870–74
 iske baad wiliam higginz ne aadhunik shlesh pattica kaa avishkaar kiya, jisane khagoleey photography kii paddati ko bhi saamaanya photography kii hi bhanti sugam evam aadambaraheen bana diya

 england ke ansli kaaman ne 30 june 1883 ko orin niharika kaa ek atyant utkrisht chitra praapt kiya, jiske liye unhen royal socity kaa swarnapadak mila
 The instruments of astronomical photography and the photographic emulsion and photographic methods continued to improve and develop at a very rapid pace and today it has been able to achieve the maturity of its development

 Varna photography is also used to study the composition and characteristics of the constellations of constellations and the planets' surface and variable atmosphere
 yah gyatavya he ki koi nakshatra sabhi rangon ke liye samaan rup se deeptiman nahin hota
 Therefore, using different types of filters and photographic emulsion, their values in the field of different colors are known
 isse unki rachana, taap, dharaatal, ghanatv tathaa vayumandal aadi ke sambandh main anek amuly jaankariyaan praapt hoti hai

 There are two types of inertial objects commonly photographed
 taron yaa nakshatron sadrush binduvat tathaa grahon, chandramaa, surya athwa niharikaon sadrush vistrut
 Photographs of light coming from celestial bodies have to be photographed for detailed astrological study
 in sab photographon se nimnlikhit mahatvapurn jaankariyaan praapt hoti hai: The composition of the surface and atmosphere, etc
, of the target aerial objects and the form and physical conditions of those bodies and vibhinn pindon ke jyoti evam deeptimanon kii tulanaatmak jaankaree
 The process of astronomical photography is very different from normal photography, as it has to solve some problems which cannot be done by normal photography
 inamen se kuch ye he: The distance of the celestial bodies is very large and the remaining stars are not visible except the nearest stars of the earth
 is kaaran un taron ke chitra saamaanya camaron se nahin khinche ja sakate
 Many stars are at an infinite distance from us, because they appear to be extremely close or adjacent to each other, although the distance between them is more than billions, trillions of miles
 iske atirikt dwidaihik yaa yugmak taron kii bhi atyadhik sankhya akaash main chhitaki padi he
 It is not possible to separate them from normal cameras, as the lenses of these cameras have very limited resolution
 sudurastha taron kii mandatha ke kaaran paryaapt dirghakaalik udbhasana dena padataa he, jo kabhi kabhi kai ghanton tak kaa hota he
 Due to the daily rotation of the Earth, the inert objects are seen moving from east to west
 isaliye inkaa photochitr lene ke liye aavashyak he ki camere kaa abhidrishyak bhi unheen kii gati se usee disha main ghumta rahe
 To solve these problems, the camera dealing with astronomical photography consists of a telescope, which converges the photons coming from inertial objects onto the photopathic
 yah photo plate doordarshee ke netrak ke sthaan par or abhidrishyak ke focus-tal par laga hota he
 For such a visionary, the view is selected keeping in view the objective of the objective
 akashiya pindon kii dhoomiltaa ke kaaran drut camere kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The impermeability of the camera taking a photo of a pointwise object depends on the aperture or porosity of the viewer, but for a wide object, the dependence on the viewer's orifice, ie, the confluence of the eye and the perforation of the orifice
 bimb ke ucch vibhedan ke liye adhik nabhyantarwale abhidrishyak kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 For this reason, due to the proportional relationship between the camera's illumination and the size of the telescope, one has to take into account
 taron kii sthitiyon evam gatiyon kaa maapan karne ke hetu deergh nabhivartak yaa khagol rekhachitrak kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jo uttam bimb utpann kar sakate hai
 The field of vision covered by the telescopes of these circles is generally less, ie, only a small part of the sky can become a clear image in them
 iske atirikt, lens dwaara banaanevaala bimb chapata arthath pattica par sarvatra ek si tivrata vaala nahin hota varan uski tivrata drushtikshetra ke centre par sarvaadhik hoti he tathaa usase pare kramash:drut gati se ghatati jaati he
 This aberration in astronomical photography can cause serious errors
 in sab kathinaaiyon kaa parihaar karne ke liye abhidrishyak yukt camere ko vistrutkshetra camera kehete hai
 In 1930, scientist Bardhard Schmidt of the Hamburg Observatory first built such a camera, and D
D
 Maxtutov of Russia and A
D
 In 1940, some improvements were made by Bowers independently
 saadhaaran taur par mascutov pranali deergh sangamantaron ke liye tathaa shmit pranali laghu sangamantaron ke liye upyukt he
 These cameras have a field of view of 600 or more and can simultaneously monitor a wide range of sky
 shmit pranali kaa sarvotkrisht vyaavhaarik rup baker-nan camera he, jo kritrim grahon, upgrahon tathaa ulkaon ke panthon ko ankit karne ke liye banaaya gaya he
 It has a very high ability to collect light, due to which a very clear picture of about 55 views is obtained from very short exposures
 prithvi ke ghurnan ke kaaran gatiman prathit honevaale akashiya pindon kaa chitra lene ke liye camere ke doordarshee ko is prakaar aropit karte hai ki vah ghatiyantra kii sahaayta se pindon kii abhaasi gati kii dasha main chalata rahe, jisase udbhasana kaal main vastu se aanevaali kirane photo par bimb ke sthaan par hi padati rahen or is prakaar bimb pattica par jamaa rahe
 For this, the camera is mounted in a special method which is called equinox implantation
 isamen do paraspar lambavat ghurnaksh hote hai---ek to prithvi ke aksh ke samaantar, jise dhruviya aksh kehete hai or doosraa iske lanvabat jise dikpaat aksh kehete hai
 First, the telescope is rotated to the north or south of the celestial equator by an electronometer equal to the target side of the target star, and the revolution angle tightens the device in a clamp so that it cannot move north or south
 is kaaran ab doordarshee keval vishuvatvrutt ke hi samaantar gum saktaa he
 This will be the line on which that star will be moving
 camere se sambhddha ghatiyantra doordarshee ko dhruviya aksh ke chaaron ore is gati se ghumata he ki uskaa ek chakkar ek nakshatra diwas main puraa hota he
 As the rotation of the Earth makes the celestial bodies move from east to west, so the telescope also moves in the same direction
 dhruviya aksh se lage hue ek anshaankit vrutt par doordarshee kaa ghumaav padhakar yah gyaat kiya ja saktaa he ki doordarshee kisi kshan akash main kis disha kii ore sanket kar rahaa he
 Even after making so many arrangements, a solution to a very important problem remains
 koi tara jyon jyon kshitij kii ore padataa he, uske prakaash kii kirnon ko doordarshee tak pahunchne ke liye kramash: adhikadhik vayumandaleey duuri paar kerani padati he
 It will be clear from the view in Fig
 3
 that when a star is in position 1, its telescope reaches the telescope at the position on the earth plane by crossing the distance in the air, but when that star is in position 2 The optics have to cross a large distance in the air, which is relatively high
 isliye vaayu dwaara prakaash kii kirnon main honevaale vartan kii maatra nirantar badalati rahati he
 For this reason, no mechanical or automatic system of modification can be possible for the rotation of rays
 isliye prekshak ko ek anya doordarshee se taare ko dekhte rahanaa padataa he or uski sahaayta se camere ke doordarshee ko haath se ghumaakar is prakaar samyojit karnaa padataa he ki kirane photo pattica par bimb ke sthaan par hi ekatra hoti rahen

 choti khidki, roshanadaan Economics is the branch of social science under which the production, distribution, exchange and consumption of goods and services are studied
 'arthshaastra' shabd sanskrit shabdon arth or shaastra kii sandhi se bana he, jiskaa shabdic arth he - 'dhan kaa adhyayan'
 The systematic knowledge of human actions in relation to a subject is called the scripture of that subject, so in economics it is necessary to have systematic knowledge of the work related to human beings
 arthshaastra kaa prayog yah samajhane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he ki arthvyavastha kis tarah se kaary karti he or samaaj main vibhinn virgon kaa aarthik sambandh kaisaa he
 Economical analysis is used in various fields related to society, such as: crime, education, family, health, law, politics, religion, social institutions and war etc
 pro
 samulson ke anusaar, The British economist Alfred Marshall defines the subject as 'a study of everyday life of mankind'
 marshall ne paaya tha ki samaaj main jo kuch bhi ghat rahaa he, uske peeche aarthik shaktiyaan hua karti hai
 That is why we need to understand its economic basis in order to understand the society and make it better
 leonnelle robinson ke anusaar aadhunik arthshaastra kii paribhaasha is prakaar he- Rarity means that the available resources are unable to meet all the demands and needs
 durlabhta or sansadhano ke vaikalpik upyogon ke kaaran hi arthshaastra kii praasangikta he
 Hence this topic studies options under the influence of motivators and resources
 arthshaastra main arthsambandhi baton kii pradhanta hona swaabhaavik he
 But we should not forget that the purpose of knowledge is not only to gain meaning, it is also to achieve welfare, happiness and peace for the world by searching for truth
 arthshaastra yah bhi batalaata he ki manushyon ke aarthik prayatnon dwaara vishwa main sukh or shanti kaise praapt ho sakati he
 Like all the scriptures, the aim of economics is also world welfare
 arthshaastra kaa drushtikon antarrashtriya he, yadhyapi usamen vyaktigat or rashtriya hiton kaa bhi vivechan rahata he
 It is possible that some people or nations become rich after studying this scripture and start exploiting other people or nations in the worry of becoming more rich, which disrupts the peace of the world
 parantu unke shoshan sambandhi ye sab kaary arthshaastra ke anuroop yaa uchit nahin kahe ja sakate, kyonki arthshaastra to unheen kaaryon kaa samarthan kar saktaa he, jiske dwaara vishwakalyaan kii vruddhi ho
 It is clear from this discussion that the simple definition of economics should be as follows - In economics, all the work related to the meaning of municipals is ordered in a systematic way
 uskaa dhyey vishwakalyaan he or uskaa drushtikon antarrashtriya he
 In which money related verbs are studied, it is called Arthashastra
 arthshaastra kii vishay-saamagree kaa sanket isaki paribhaasha se miltaa he
 Arthashatra is the science that studies the relationship between the natural alternative means of human use and their use
 arthshaastra kaa saiddhanthik evam vyavhaarik mahatv he
 The first book written on economics is Kautilya's Arthashastra
 arthshaastra bahut pracheen vidya he
 Four Upvedas were built in very ancient times
 in chaaron upavedon main arthved bhi ek upved mana jaataa he, parantu ab yah uplabdh nahin he
 Economics is also enumerated in the Vishnu Purana in the ancient and ancient 18 disciplines of India
 is samay barhospaty tathaa kautilia arthshaastra uplabdh hai
 Jupiter was the first Acharya of economics
 unka arthshaastra sutron ke rup main praapt he, parantu usamen arthshaastra sambandhi sab baton kaa samavesh nahin he
 Kautilya's Arthashastra is the only treatise available on the subject of Arthashastra, hence its importance is the highest
 acharya kautilya, chanakya ke naam se bhi prasiddh hai
 He was the general secretary of Chandragupta Maurya
 inkaa granth 'arthshaastra' panditon kii raay main praaia: 2,300 varsh purana he
 According to Acharya Kautilya, the field of economics is to think of ways to obtain and protect the Earth
 unhone apane arthshaastra main brahmacharya kii diksha se lekar deshon kii vijay karne kii anek baton kaa samavesh kiya he
 Acharya Kautilya discusses in detail the things of colonization of cities, management of detectives, creation of army, establishment of courts, marriage rules, rules, methods of climbing the sutras, fortifications, differences of treaties, architecture, etc
 pramant: is granth kii kitni hi baaten arthshaastra ke aadhunik kaal main nirdisht kshetra se baahar kii hai
 In it, topics like politics, criminology, sociology, ethics etc
 have also been considered

 adam smith vartmaan arthshaastra ke janmdata maane jate hai

 In this, he has stated that the objective of economics of every country is to increase the wealth and power of that country
 unke baad malths, ricardo, mil, jevans, kaal marks, sithvik, marshall, vaakar, tasig ore robins ne arthshaastra sambandhi vishyon par sundar rachanaayen kin
 But Professor Marshall owes a certain amount to the economics, although Professor Robbins differs from Professor Marshall in the area of economics
 paashchaatya arthshaastriyon main arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main teen dal nishchit rup se dikhaai padate hai
 The first team is of Professor Robbins, who does not accept economics as a science, to consider such things in economics as a guide to economic reforms
 doosraa dal profesar marshall, profesar pigu ityadi kaa he, jo arthshaastra ko vigyaan maanate hue bhi yah sweekaar karata he ki arthshaastra ke adhyayan kaa mukhya vishay manushya he or uski aarthik unnati ke liye jin jin baton kii aavashyaktaa he, un sabakaa vichaar arthshaastra main kiya janaa aavashyak he
 But the economists of this party want to separate economics from politics
 teesraa dal karl marks ke samaan samaajwaadiyon kaa he, jo manushya ke shram ko hi utpati kaa saadhan maanata he or puunjipatiyon tathaa jameendaaron kaa naash karke mazdooron kii unnati chahta he
 He also wants the rule of workers
 teenon dalon main arthshaastra ke kshetra ke sambandh main bahut matbhed he
 Therefore it is necessary to consider this question: dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad america or soviet sangh main sheet yuddh chhid gaya
 This was not a war, but the world was divided into two parts
 sheet yuddh ke dauraan america, england, germany, austrailia, france, canada, spain ek taraf the
 All these countries were democratic and the policy of open economy was adopted here
 logon ko vyapaar karne kii khuli chhot thi
 There was an exemption for investing in the stock market
 in deshon main bahut sari bady-bady companiyaan baniin
 There was new research in these companies
 vishvavidhyalay, soochna praudyogiki, enginiyari udyog, bank aadi sabhi kshetron main jamkar tarakkee hui
 All these countries accepted the policy of promoting trade from other countries
 1945 ke baad se in sabhi deshon ne khub tarakkee kii
 On the other hand there were many more countries including Russia, China, Myanmar, East Germany, where the economic policy of socialism was adopted
 yahan par adhikansh udyogon par kadaa sarkari niyantran hota tha
 The government had the right over the profits from the industries
 saamanytah ye desh duusare loktantric deshon ke saath bahut kam vyapaar karte the
 Due to this kind of economic policy, there was not much competition in the industries here
 aam logon ko bhi laabh kamaane ke liye koi protsaahan nahin tha
 Due to these reasons, economic growth in these countries was very less
 3 oktober-1990 ko purv germany or pashchim germany kaa vilay hua
 United Germany, like progressive West Germany, adopted an open economy and democracy
 iske baad 1991 main soviet rus kaa vikhandan hua or rus sahit 15 deshon kaa janm hua
 Russia too adopted an open economy excluding socialism
 china ne samaajwaad ko puri tarah to nahin choda par 1970 ke ant se udaar nitiyon ko apanaaya or agle 3 varshon main bahut unnati kii
 Czechoslovakia was also a socialist country
 1-janvari-1993 ko iskaa check republic or slovakia main vikhandan hua
 These countries also abandoned socialism and adopted democracy and open economy
 mulya kii avadharana arthshaastra main kendriya he
 One way to measure this is the market price of the commodity
 adam smith ne shram ko mulya ke mukhya shrot ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 The "labor theory of value" has been proposed by many economists, including Karl Marx
 is siddhanth ke anusaar kisi seva yaa vastu kaa mulya uske utpaadan main prayukt shram ke baraabar hot he
 Most people believe that its value determines the price of the commodity
 daam kaa yah shram siddhanth "mulya ke utpaadan laagat siddhanth" se nikatataa se judaa hua he
 Demand, interpretation and forecasting of the price and quantity of goods sold in a fully competitive market are done with the help of demand supply
 yah arthshaastra ke sabase mulbhoot prarupon main se ek he
 It is used extensively for the development of large theories and formats respectively
 maang, kisi niyat avadhi main kisi utpaada kii vah maatra he, jise niyat daam par upabhokta khareednaa chahta he or kharidne main sakasham he
 Demand is usually displayed in the form of a table or graph showing the relationship between price and desired quantity
 aapurti vastu kii vah maatra he jise niyat samay main diye gayi daam par utpaadak yaa vikreta bazaar main bechney ke liye taiyaar he
 Supplies are usually displayed in the form of a table or graph showing the relationship between price and quantity of supply
 pro robins ke anusaar arthshaastra vah vigyaan he jo manushya ke un kaaryon kaa adhyayan karata he jo icchit vastu or uske parimit sadhano ke rup main upasthit hote hai, jinka upyog vaikalpik yaa kam se kam do prakaar se kiya jaataa he
 The following things are clear from this definition of economics - manushya apni ichchhaaon kii tripti se sukh kaa anubhav karata he
 Therefore every human wants to satisfy his desires
 ichchhaaon kii tripti ke liye uske paas jo saadhan, dravya ityadi hai ve parimit hai
 No matter how rich a person is, the amount of his money must remain finite; Then he can use this finite instrument material in many ways
 isliye upyukt paribhaasha ke anusaar arthshaastra main manushyon ke un sab kaaryo ke sambandh main vichaar kiya jaataa he jo vah parimit sadhano dwaara apni ichchhaaon ko trupt karne ke liye karata he
 In this way, it becomes necessary to discuss all the functions related to its consumption in economics
 isi prakaar manushya ko bazaar main anek vastuen kis prakaar kharidne kaa saadhan dravya parimit rahata he
 Through this finite instrument, how he buys his essentials, which item he buys or sells at what rate, at what rate, that is, how he regulates, all these things are considered in economics
 manushya jab koi vastu taiyaar karata he, iske taiyaar karne ke saadhan parimit rahete hai or un sadhano kaa upyog vah kai tarah se kar saktaa he
 Therefore, it is natural to interpret all the work related to origins in economics
 manushya ko apane samay kaa upyog karne kii anek icchaayen hoti hai
 But time is always finite and can be used in many ways
 maan lijie, koi manushya so rahaa he, puja kar rahaa he yaa koi khel khel rahaa he
 According to Professor Rabin's definition, these works should be interpreted in economics, because the time spent in gold in worship or in sports could have been spent in any other work
 manushya koi bhi kaam kare, usamen samay kii aavashyaktaa avashya padati he or is parimit saadhan samay ke upyog kaa vivechan arthshaastra main avashya hona chahie
 Professor Robbins's definition of economics is so broad that according to it the interpretation of every work of human beings, whether it is religious, political or social, falls within economics
 is paribhaasha ko maan lene se arthshaastra, raajnneeti, dharamshastra or samajashaastra kii simaaon kaa spashtikaran baraabar nahin ho paata he
 The followers of Professor Robbins hold that according to finite means every aspect of human work has its economic aspect and this aspect is considered in economics
 ve kehete hai, yadi kisi kaary kaa sambandh rajya se ho to uskaa us pahalu se vichaar raajnneetishastra main kiya jaae or yadi us kaary kaa sambandh dharm se bhi ho to us pahalu se unka vichaar dharamshastra main kiya jaae
 Suppose a man is selling a commodity at a much higher price in Chorbazar
 saadhan parimit hone ke kaaran vah jo kaary kar rahaa he or uskaa prabhaav vastu kii utpati yaa purti par kya pad rahaa he, iskaa vichaar to arthshaastra main hoga; chorbazari karanevaale ke sambandh main rajya kaa kya kartavya he, iskaa vichaar raajnneetishastra yaa dandniti main hoga
 Whether this work is good or bad, it will be considered in sociology, ethics or theology
 or, yah kaise roka ja saktaa he, iskaa vichaar shaayad kisi bhi shaastra main na ho
 It is worth considering how far it is appropriate to consider any work from only one aspect
 profesar robins kii arthshaastra kii paribhaasha kii duusari dhyaan dene yogya baat yah he ki vah arthshaastra ko keval vigyaan kii maanata he
 It contains only the rules that explain the relation of work reason at any given time
 paristhitiyon main kis prakaar ke parivartan hone chahie or paristhitiyon ke badalane ke kya tareeke hai, in gambhir prashnon par usamen vichaar nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki ye sab kaary vigyaan ke baahar hai
 Suppose, at some point of time, the number of people drinking alcohol in a country is increasing
 professor robins kii paribhaasha ke anusaar arthshaastra main keval yahi vichaar kiya jayega ki sharaab pinevaalon kii sankhya badhane se sharaab kii keemat, sharaab paidaa karanevaalon or swayan sharaabiyon par kya asar padegaa
 But there is no scope in his economics to consider the question whether drinking alcohol is good or bad and how can the habit of drinking alcohol be stopped by the government
 unke arthshaastra main maargdarshan kaa abhaav he
 Guidance is considered to be an important part of every scripture and this part is lacking in Professor Rabin's definition of economics
 is kami ke kaaran arthshaastra kaa adhyayan janata ke liye laabhakaari nahin ho saktaa
 Socialists want that capitalists and landlords do not exist, the government should be laborers and the government should have complete control over the economic condition of the country
 ve apni arthshaastra sambandhi pustakon main in prashnon par bhi vichaar karte hai ki majdoor sarkaar kis prakaar sthapit honi chahie
 How to eradicate the existence of landlords and capitalists
 majdoor sarkaar kaa sagathan kis prakaar kaa ho or unka sanghathan sansarvyapee kis prakaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way, socialist writers make the field of economics so broad that many things of political science come into it
 hamako arthshaastra kaa kshetra is prakaar nirdhaarit karnaa chahie jisase usamen raajnneetishastra yaa anya kisi shaastra kii baton kaa samavesh na hone paae
 In relation to the field of economics, it is also necessary to consider Professor Marshall's definition of economics
 professor marshall ke matanusaar arthshaastra manushya ke jivan sambandhi saadhaaran kaaryon kaa adhyayan karata he
 He examines the personal and social functions of humans, which are closely related to acquiring and using physical means for their welfare
 professor marshall ne munashya ke kalyaan ko arthshaastra kii paribhaasha main sthaan dekar arthshaastra ke kshetra ko kuch badha diya he
 But even this economist did not give any thought in his book regarding the goal of economics
 vartmaan kaal main paashchaatya arthshaastriyon ne arthshaastra kaa kshetra to badha diya he, parantu aaj bhi ve arthshaastra ke dhyey ke sambandh main vichaar karnaa arthshaastra ke kshetra ke adanr sweekaar nahin karte
 Now economics is being given the form of art
 sansar main sarvatra aarthik yojanaon kii charchaa he
 Formulating an economic plan is an art
 bina dhyey ke koi yojana taiyaar hi nahin kii ja sakati
 There is no single objective of those who formulate these plans, because economics do not have any definite goal
 prayek yojana kaa ek alag hi dhyey maan liya jaataa he
 Now ways of improving the condition of countrymen are also considered in economics, but the ultimate goal of improving this condition has not been decided yet
 sarvamaanya dhyey ke abhaav main arthshaastriyon main matbhinnata itani bad gai he ki kisi vishay par do arthshaastriyon kaa ek mat kathinata se ho paata he
 This divergence has created a major hurdle in the study of economics
 is baadha ko dur karne ke liye paashchaatya arthshaastriyon ko apane granthon main arthshaastra ke dhyey ke sambandh main gambhirthapurvak vichaar karnaa chahie or jahaan tak sambhav ho, arthshaastra kaa ek sarvamaanya dhyey sheeghra nishchit kar lenaa chahie
 Everyone in the world wants to be happier and avoid sorrow
 vah jaanata he ki apni ichha jab trupt hoti he tab sukh praapt hota he or jab ichha kii purti nahin hoti tab du:kha kaa anubhav hota he
 Money helps in getting the desired item
 isliye prayek vyakti dhan praapt karne kaa praytn karata he
 He understands that happiness is achieved in the world only by money
 adhik se adhik sukh praapt karne ke liye vah adhik se adhik dhan praapt karne kaa praytn karata he
 In the worry of obtaining this wealth, he often does not consider how the money is being received
 iskaa parinaam yah hota he ki dhan aise sadhano dwaara bhi praapt kiya jaataa he jinase dusron kaa shoshan hota he, dusron ko dukh pahunchataa he
 In this way, many examples of obtaining wealth can be given
 poonjipati adhik dhan praapt karne kii chintaa main apane mazdooron ko uchit mazdooree nahin detaa
 This causes the condition of workers to deteriorate
 duukaandaar khaadya padaartho main milawat karke apane graahakon ke swasthya ko nasht karata he
 Many simple people are cheated by thieves, Mahajan ruins families of innumerable individuals by taking excessive interest from borrowers and excessive rent from landlord farmers
 prakruti kaa yah atal niyam he ki jo jaisaa bota he usko vaisaa hi kaatna padataa he
 Those who receive money by exploiting others or causing grief may forget this rule
 jo dhan dusron ko dukh pahunchaakar praapt hota he usase ant main du:kha hi miltaa he
 To expect happiness from him is futile
 yah satya he ki dusron ko dukh pahunchaakar jo dhan praapt kiya jaataa he usase icchit vastuen praapt kii ja sakati he or in vastuon ko praapt karne se sukh mil saktaa he
 But this happiness is temporary and eventually becomes a cause of sorrow
 sansar main aisi kai vastuen hai jinka upyog karne se tatkaal to sukh miltaa he, parantu dirghakaal main unase dukh kii prapti hoti he
 For example, there is immediate pleasure from the consumption of intoxicating substances, but when they become habitual, then their intake starts in excessive quantity, which has a bad effect on health
 isse ant main du:khee hona padataa he
 The wealth gained by harming others certainly increases bad habits and by giving temporary happiness for some time it becomes a means of increasing grief
 dusron ko dukh dekar praapt kiya hua dhan kabhi bhi sthaayee sukh or shanti kaa sadhak nahin ho saktaa
 There are two types of happiness
 kuch sukh to aise hai jo dusron ko dukh pahunchaakar praapt hote hai
 Examples of these have been given above
 kuch sukh aise hai jo dusron ko sukhi banaakar prapt hote hai
 They create peace in human mind
 apana kartavya paalan karne se jo sukh praapt hota he vah bhi shanti prad hota he kartavyapaalan karte samay jo shram karnaa padataa he usase kuch ksht avashya maaloom hota he, parantu kaary puraa hone par vah du:kha sukh main parinat ho jaataa he or usasen man main shanti utpann hoti he
 This kind of happiness is not a means of sorrow in future and this type of happiness is called bliss
 jab anand hi anand praapt hota he tab du:kha kaa lesh maatr bhi nahin rah jaataa
 Such a condition is called ecstasy
 paramanand praapt karnaa prayek vyakti kaa sarvottam dhyey he
 That is the peak of autism
 prayek manushya kaa kalyaan isi main he ki vah paramanand praapt karne kaa hameshaa praytn karata rahe
 He always enjoys happiness that does not become the cause or means of sorrow in future and he starts to experience peace and contentment
 jab ham apane prayatnon dwaara dusron ko sukh pahunchaate hai or unke kalyaan ke saadhan ban jate hai tab prakruti ke atal niyam ke anusaar inhen prayatnon dwaara hamaare kalyaan main bhi vruddhi hone lagati he
 The simple way to achieve autism is to become a means of welfare of others
 isi prakaar apane kaaryon dwaara kisi ko bhi du:kha na pahunchaana apane dukh se bachane kaa sabase saral tarika he
 Everyone should understand well that his true interest can only be proved by the benefit or charity of others
 isse yah spasht he ki dusron kaa sukh arthath vishwakalyaan hi apane sthaayee sukh or shanti arthath aatmakalyaan kaa ekmaatr saadhan he
 When every person will always try for the welfare of others for their welfare, then there will be no opposition to selfishness in any way, all kinds of conflict in the world will go away and everywhere happiness and peace will be permanently established
 aatmakalyaan ke liye yah aavashyak he ki prayek vyakti dusron ke swaarthon ko utana hi mahatv de jitna vah apane swaarth ko detaa he
 Just as he tries to increase his pleasures, similarly he should also try to increase the pleasures of others
 iskaa parinam yah hoga ki aise kaary band ho jaayenge jinke kaaran dusron ke du:khon kii vruddhi hoti he
 With this, there will be a continuous increase of happiness in the lives of the world and the welfare of the world will reach a growing climax
 bina vishwakalyaan ke kisi bhi vyakti kaa aatmakalyaan nahin ho saktaa
 True autism can only be achieved by world welfare
 aatmakalyaan hi prayek vyakti kaa sarvottam dhyey he or jab arthshaastra manushya ke aarthik prayatnon kaa adhyayan karata he tab uskaa dhyey bhi aatmakalyaan hi hona chahie
 But, as stated above, true autism can only be achieved by world welfare
 isliye arthshaastra kaa dhyey vishwakalyaan hi hona chahie
 We have already told that when a wish is not fulfilled, then one experiences sorrow
 isliye yadi kisi vastu kii ichha hi na kii jaae to du:kha praapt karne kaa avasar hi na praapt ho
 Some gentlemen are of the opinion that the lack of sorrow and permanent happiness and peace can be achieved by the retirement of all desires
 isliye is drushti se dekha jaae tab to sab ichchhaaon kaa abhaav hi arthshaastra kaa dhyey hona chahie
 It is fine that through practice one can control desires, but to achieve such condition when any kind of desire does not arise, it is not practical for one of the ordinary person
 astu, arthshaastra kaa dhyey sampurna ichchhaaon ke abhaav ko maan lene se thode se vyaktiyon kaa hi kalyaan ho sakegaa or janata kaa usase kuch bhi laabh na hoga, isliye is dhyey ko maan lenaa uchit na hoga
 Some people believe that human welfare is the goal of economics
 ve jeevajantuon tathaa pashupakshiyon ke hiton kaa dhyaan rakhana aavashyak nahin samajhate
 They probably believe that God created animals and animals and birds for human happiness only
 isliye unako du:kha pahunchaakar yaa vadh karke yadi manushyon kii ichchhaaon kii purti ho sakati ho to unako du:kha pahunchaane main kuch bhi aapatti nahin honi chahie
 But theology and Mahatma Gandhi are of the opinion that every person should do such a work that interests the 'universal interest' i
e
 all the living beings, so that no one is harmed
 jab manushya prayek jeevadharee ke hit ko apane nijee hit ke samaan maanane lagata he tabhi usko sthaayee sukh or shanti praapt hoti he
 Mahatma Gandhi has named this route 'sarvodaya'
 is sarvoday maarg dwaara hi sansar main prayek prakaar kaa sangharsh dur ho saktaa he, shoshan kaa ant ho saktaa he or vishwashanti sthapit ho sakati he
