 In his poems, he had described the future events

 Nostradamus, famous for announcing the future thousands of years ago, was born on 14 December 1503 in Saint Remy, a small village in France

 Nostradamus started making predictions from adolescence
 jyotish main unki babbti dilchaspee ne mata-pita ko chintaa main daal diya kyonki us samay kattarpanthi isai is vidya ko acchhee najar se nahin dekhte the
 To divert his attention from astrology, he was sent to Mont Pelier to study medical science, after which he completed three years of study and became a doctor of Nostradamus

 In this way, he also said his words and there was no injury to the Queen's mind
 tabhi se nastredamas ne yah tay kar liya ki ve apni bhavishyavaaneeyan ko isi tarah chando main hi vyakt karengen
 After 1550, Nostredamus left the profession of doctor and concentrated his attention on the practice of astrology

 There were forecasts about planetary positions, weather and crops etc

 The last years of Nostradamus's life went through a lot of suffering

 Unlawful or Unreasonable - Some officials add a criterion of the definition of terrorism to a "legitimate" government-authorized distinction between demeanor or impersonal action to make it legitimate and other actors, including those individuals and small groups
 The criterion, that terrorism otherwise The use of functions would not be justified as terrorism would not be considered if they were government approved
 If it were a "legitimate" government authorized by example For Rann, a city that is designed to influence civilian support for a reason, firebombing terrorism will not be considered
 This criterion is inherently and problematic because it is not universally accepted: this state Deny the existence of terrorism, whether it can perform the same task or as terrorism, based on whether its sponsorship is known to a "legitimate" government Security can not be; "validity" is kasuti saarvbhaumik sweekaar kiye jate hai nahin he in kaarnon ke liye

 Considerations as acts by states of violence to which states do not meet or sponsor terrorism vary widely
 jab rajyon samoohon kuch aatankwaadi hone dwaara vichaar ke liye dhan uplabdh karaate hai, ve kabhi kabhi hi jaise unhen sweekaar karte hai
 The concept of state terrorism is controversial
 Wars during military action by states are generally not considered terrorism, even when they involve significant civilian casualties

 This involves the use of state resources by employing foreign policies of a state, such as performing acts of state terrorism considered directly by using its military
 Professor of Political Science, Michael Stohl, of London, Germany Examples of bombing and US nuclear destruction include cites Hiroshima during World War II
 He said the use of terror tactics is more common in international relations that the state has been and remains a more likely possibility of terrorism than employer insurgents argue within the international system

 "ve kehete hai ki aatankwaad ke sansthagat rup he ki vishwa yuddh daaloonga nimnlikhit jagah le lee parivartan kaa ek parinaam ke rup main hui bahes he
 In this analysis, the presence of state terrorism as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction and shaped the rapidly growing accepted form of behavior of the state to lead such Legitimizing violent behavior of

 pratikriyaaon ke vishisht prakaar main shaamil hai: Media risk is the primary goal of taking them out of terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media
 kuch herpher or shoshan ko media ke liye is par vichaar karen
 Others, expressed by a view of itself, consider terrorism to be a symptom of a highly controlled mass media, which would otherwise not give voice to alternative viewpoints because Paul Watson who "filled you in any other way" i cannot find your information that the controlled media is responsible for terrorism, "he said
 paul watasan kaa sanghathan samudr Shepherd swayan kiya gaya "branded heparisthitiki aatankwaadi ", haalanki yah daawa he ki koi bhi hataahat kaaran nahin he
 This mass media will often censor organizations further involved in terrorism to discourage further terrorism

 Physical constants are different from mathematical constants in that the mathematical constants are numerically fixed, but they are not related to any measurement

 See the basic physical constants for detailed information
 Using dimensional analysis, it is possible combine fundamental physical constants to produce basic units of measurement
 Depending on the choice and arrangement of constants used, the resulting natural units may have physical meaning
 For example, Planck units use c, G, ħ, ε 0 { \ displaystyle c,g, \ hbar , \ varepsilon _{0}} and k { \ displaystyle k} to derive constants relevant to unified theories, including quantum gravity

 In 2003, in an international survey conducted by BBC World Service, in which around 7,000 songs were selected from around the world to select the ten most famous songs of the time, and according to BBC, people from 155 countries / islands had it

 yadi bangla bhashaa ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaay to iskaa sheershak "bande maataram" hona chaiye "vande maataram" nahin
 Since the word 'vande' is correct in Hindi and Sanskrit language, but the song was originally written in Bengali script and since there is no other letter in Bengali script, it was written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay under the title Bande Mataram
 is tathy ko dhyaan main rakhte hue sheershak 'bande maataram' hona chaiye tha
 But there is no meaning of 'bande Mataram' in Sanskrit and "vande Mataram" pronunciation means "I pray to Mother", so writing and reading Vande Mataram in Devanagari script would be expedient

 were also published

 Initially, only two of its verses were composed, which were in Sanskrit
 in donon padon main keval mathrubhumi kii vandana thi
 When he wrote a Bengali novel called Anand Math in 1882, then he also included this song in the love of the motherland
 yah upanyaas angreji shashan, jameendaaron ke shoshan va prakritik prakope main mar rahi janata ko jaagrit karnehetu achaanak uth khadey hue sanyasi vidroh par aadhaarit tha
 This factual history was mentioned by Bankim Babu himself in the third edition of 'anand Math'

 In all these latter terms, the motherland is praised as Durga
 yah geet ravivaar, karthik sudi navami, shake 1797 ko puraa hua
 It is said that he wrote this song on the train while coming to Naihati from Sealdah
 bengal main chale swadhinata-aandolan ke dauraan vibhinn reliyon main josh bharne ke liye yah geet gaaya jane laga
 Gradually this song became highly popular among the people
 british sarkaar isaki lokapriyata se bhayakrant ho uthi or usne is par pratibandh lagane par vichaar karnaa shuru kar diya
 Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur sang this song at the Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress in 1896
 paanch saal baad yani san 1901 main kalakatta main hue ek anya adhiveshan main shri charandas ne yah geet punah gaaya
 The song was given by Sarladevi Chaudharani at the Banaras session of 1905
 congress-adhiveshnon ke alaava aazaadee ke aandolan ke dauraan is geet ke prayog ke kaaphi udhaaharan maujuud hai
 Lala Lajpat Rai started the publication of the journal from Lahore named Vande Mataram

 In 1907, when Madame Bhikhaji Cama hoisted the tricolor in Stuttgart, Germany, "vande Mataram" was written in the middle of it
 arya printing press, lahore tathaa bhartiya press, dehradun se san 1929 main prakashit kakori ke shahid pan0 ram prasad 'bismil' kii pratibandhit pustak "kranti gitanjali" main pehla geet "matra-vandana" vande maataram hi tha jisamen unhone keval is geet ke do hi pad diye the or uske baad is geet kii prashasti main vande maataram sheershak se ek swarchit urdu ghazal di thi jo us kalkhand ke asankhya anaam hutatmaon kii aawaaj ko abhivyakti detii he
 Restricted in the British period, this book is now edited and available in libraries
 swadhinata sangram main is geet kii nirnaayak bhagidaari ke baavjood jab raashtragan ke chayan kii baat aayi to vande maataram ke sthaan par rabindranath thakur dwaara likhe va gaaye gayi geet jan gana man ko variyata di gayi
 The reason for this was that some Muslims objected to the song "vande Mataram", because Goddess Durga is seen as a nation in this song
 iske alaava unka yah bhi maananaa tha ki yah geet jis anand math upanyaas se liya gaya he vah musalamaanon ke khilaaf likhaa gaya he
 In view of these objections, in 1937, the Congress took a deep view on this dispute
 jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main gathit samiti jisamen moulana abul kalam aaazaad bhi shaamil the, ne paaya ki is geet ke shuruuaati do pad to mathrubhumi kii prashansa main kahe gayi hai, lekin baad ke padon main hindu devi-devataaon kaa zikr hone lagata he; isaliye yah nirnay liya gaya ki is geet ke shuruaati do padon ko hi raashtra-geet ke rup main prayukt kiya jaayegaa
 In this way, Jana Hee Jan-gana-man Adhinayak of Gurudev Rabindra Nath Thakur was allowed to remain as the national anthem and Mohammad Iqbal's Qaumi Tarane Saare Jahan Se Achcha with the initial two-song song Vande Mataram national song composed by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was approved
 swatantrata prapti ke baad dow rajendra prasad ne samvidhan sabha main 24 janvari 1950 main 'vande maataram' ko raashtragit ke rup main apnaane sambandhi vaktavy padhaa jise sweekaar kar liya gaya
 The statement made by Dr
 Rajendra Prasad to the Constituent Assembly is as follows: anand math upanyaas ko lekar bhi kuch vivaad hai, kuch kattar log ise muslim virdohi maanate hai
 He says that in this, Muslims have been described as foreign and traitorous
 vande maataram gane par bhi vivaad kiya ja rahaa he
 The first two stops of this song, which are relevant, do not contain any anti-muslim talk and do not worship any goddess or Durga
 par in logon kaa kahana he ki- However, it is not the case that all Muslims of India object to this or that all Hindus insist on singing it
 yah bhi ullekhneey he ki kuch saal pehle vikhyath sangeetkaar e0 aar0 rahamaan ne, jo khud ek musalmaan hai, vande maataram ko lekar ek sangeet elbum taiyaar kiya tha jo bahut lokapriy hua
 Most people believe that this dispute is political
 kya kisi ko koi geet gane ke liye majaboor kiya ja saktaa he athwa nahin? yah prashn sarvocch nyaayalay ke samaksh bijoy emmanuele varses kerala rajya naam ke ek vaad main uthaaya gaya
 In this suit, some students were expelled from school because they refused to sing the national anthem Jana Gana Mana
 yah vidhyaarthee skool main raashtragan ke samay iske sammaan main khadey hote the tathaa iskaa sammaan karte the par geet ko gaate nahin the
 He refused to sing
 sarvocch nyaayalay ne unki yachika sweekaar kar lee or skool ko unhen waapas lene ko kaha
 The Supreme Court said that if a person honors the national anthem but does not sing it, it does not mean that he is insulting it
 at: ise na gane ke liye us vyakti ko dandit yaa pratadit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Since Vande Mataram is the national anthem of this country, the same law and rules will apply even if it is forced to sing forcefully

 Only then will he leave Vinnie's love, Rakesh
 vah vastav main shobhaa se shaadi karnaa chahta tha, kyonki vah use har kisi ke saamne sharminda karnaa chahta tha, jaise usne use apane karyaalay ke logon ke saamne sharminda kiya tha
 Therefore, Shobha assures Anil's mother to allow Vinnie to marry Rakesh
 lekin anil sochataa he ki usne daulat kii vajah se jeke se vivaah kiya he
 Anil has to roam elsewhere to forget him
 vahaan, vah sona naam kii ek ladki ke saath pyaar main pad jaataa he
 In the meantime, JK continues to mourn with Shobha all the time
 jab jeke ko baad main yah pataa chalata he kii zyada sharaab pine ke kaaran vah mar saktaa he, to vah marane se pehle shobhaa ke saath acha vyavhaar karata he, or jald hi ve pyaar main pad jate hai
 After jk's death, Anil gets married to Sona

 inkaa shasankaal alpakaalik tha
 Ratna Singh was a worthy mighty ruler among the two sons of Samar Singh in the dynasty of Bappa Rawal, Ratna Singh's brother Kumbhakarna had already left Mewar and fled to Nepal, so Ratan Singh became the ruler who was the last ruler of the Rawal branch
 chaudaavin shatabdi ke bilkul aarambhik varshon main chittor kii rajgaddi par baithe the
 His special fame has been in the name of King Ratansen in the Hindi epic Padmavat
 kuch itihaaskaar inkaa singhasanarohan 1301i0 main maanate hai to kuch 1302 i0 main
 His wife was the history-famous queen Padmini or Padmavati
 1303 i0 main allaudin khilji ke akraman se parivaar tathaa shashan sahit ye bhi nasht ho gayi
 After the rule of only one year and with the end of his dynasty, his name was lost in the stories of the bhatan-bardan
 yahan tak ki inhen sroton par mukhyatah aadhaarit hone ke kaaran karnal tod ke suprasiddh rajasthan ke itihaas sambandhi granth main bhi inkaa naam tak nahin diya gaya he
 In his place, his wife Rani Padmini's relationship with Bhimsingh has been very misleading
 suprasiddh itihaaskaar mahamahopadhyaay rhibahadur gaurishankar hirachand ojha ne karnal tod kii bhul spasht karte hue rawal ratnasingh kii aitihaasikta siddh kii
 Ojha ji has clarified all the misconceptions and truth, writing that "behind Rawal Samarsingh his son Ratnasinh sat on the throne of Chittor
 us ko shashan karte thode hi maheene hue the, itane main dilli ke sultan allaudin khilji ne chittod par akraman kar diya or chah maheene se adhik ladane ke anantar usne kila le liya
 Some of Mewar's fame, royalty, epic and Colonel Tod's Rajasthan did not even name Ratnasinh
 summersingh ke baad karan singh kaa raja hona likhaa he, parantu karansingh summersingh ke peeche nahin, kintu usase 8 peedi pehle hua tha
 Muhnot Nainasi writes in his fame that Ratanasi fought against Alauddin in the case of Padmini; But he calls Ratnasinh at one place the son of Samarasi and the son of Ajasi at another and the brother of Bhadlakhamasi, the last of which is not believable, because Lakhmsi was not the son of Ajasi but the father and head of Sisode
 is prakaar ratnasingh lakhamasi kaa bhai nahin kintu mewar kaa swami or summersingh kaa putr tha, jaisaa ki rana kumbhakarna ke samay ke vi0 san0 1517 ke kumbhalgarh ke shilaalekh or eklingamahatmaya se paaya jaataa he
 It is also written in these two that after Samarsingh his son Ratnasinh became king
 uske maare jane par lakshmanasingh chittod kii raksharth mlecchon kaa sanhaar karata hua apane saat putron sahit maaraa gaya
 " pracheen abhilekh aadi se isse adhik ratnasingh ke sambandh main koi vivaran uplabdh nahin hota he
 Details related to Alauddin Khilji's attack are found in Amir Khusro's 'tithi Alai'
 amir khusro ke ukt granth se pataa chalata he ki sultan allaudin khilji 28 janvari 1303 i0 ko chittod lene ke liye dilli se ravaanaa hua tathaa 26 agast 1303 i0 ko kila fatah ho gaya
 In connection with the invasion of Alauddin Khilji, Mahakavi Malik Muhammad Jayasi has written in his famous epic Padmavat that this attack was to obtain Padmavati, the unique beautiful wife of King Ratansen, and after many years of siege he failed to return to Khilji
 And was victorious by attacking again
 parantu ab aitihaasik tathy saamne aa jane se itihaaskaar maanane lage hai ki akraman kaa pramukh kaaran allaudin kii samrajyavaadee mahatvakanksha evam chittod kii sainik evam vyapaarik upyogita thi
 The commercial routes of Gujarat, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh, United Provinces, Sindh etc
 passed through Chittor
 swaabhaavik he ki allaudin khilji jaisaa mahatvakankshi sultan isko avashya adhikrut karnaa chahta
 It is possible that knowing the beauty of Padmini, one of her aims has also been to achieve it
 kaaran jo bhi ho parantu allaudin ke akraman ne shashan sahit rawal ratnasingh ke jivan ko bhi nasht kar diya tathaa apni bahusankhyak sakhiyon evam anya raniyon ke saath rani padmini johar karke sati ho gayi
