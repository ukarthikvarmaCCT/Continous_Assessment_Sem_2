 In large parts of the Muslim world, especially Iran, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Eastern Arabia, Turkey and the Balkans, samudaay ke netritv, vishesh rup se dharmik netritv ko sanderbhit karne ke liye kuch seferdic yahudee samudaayon main is sheershak kaa bhi upyog kiya gaya he
 The word mullah is understood primarily in the Muslim world as an honor for an educated religious person
 adarsh rup main, ek prashikshit mullah ne islamic paramparaon, or islamic kanoon kaa adhyayan kiya hoga
 Such figures often memorize the Quran

 By making Acharya Krupa a Guru, he performed three Ashwamedha Yagyas on the banks of Jahnavi

 At the same time, Dharma made the form of a bull and met Gaurupini Earth on the Saraswati coast
 gaurupini prithvi kii netron se ashru bah rahe the or vah shrihin si prathit ho rahi thi
 Religion asked the Earth - "oh God! Why are you being mistaken? What are you worried about? Are you worrying about me, now that i am left with only one foot or you are talking about this?" Worried that now the Shudra will rule over you? " prithvi boli - "he dharm! tum sarvajna hokar bhi mujh se mere dukh kaa kaaran poochhate ho! satya, pavitrataa, kshamaa, dayaa, santosh, tyaag, sham, dam, tap, saralata, kshamta, shaastra vichaar, uparati, titiksha, gyaan, vairaygy, shaury, tej, aishwarya, bal, smriti, kaanti, kaushal, swatantrata, nirbhikta, komalta, dhairya, saahas, sheel, vinay, saubhaahgya, utsaah, gambheertha, kirti, aastikta, sthirataa, gaurav, ahankaarhinta aadi gunon se yukt bhagwaan shrikrishna ke swadham gaman ke kaaran ghor kaliyug mere upar aa gaya he

 Now my good luck has ended
 " While Dharma and Prithvi were talking about this, Kali Yuga came there as a crowned Shudra and started killing them both
 raja parakshit digvijay karte huye vahiin par se guzar rahe the
 They saw the crowned Shudra with a stick in his hand, beating a cow and a bull badly
 vah bail atyant sundar tha, uskaa shwet rang tha or keval ek pair tha
 The cow was also beautiful like Kamadhenu
 donon hi bhaybheet ho kar kaanp rahe the
 Maharaj Parikshit offered his bow and bowed in a solemn voice like a cloud - "O wicked! Sinner! Naradham! Who are you? Why are you torturing these innocent cows and bulls? You are a great criminal
" tere aparaadh kaa uchit dand tera vadh hi he
 "on hearing these words, Kali Yuga shivered with fear
 maharaj ne bail se poocha ki he bail tumhaare teen pair cas toote gayi hai
 You are a bull or a god
 he dhenuputr! tum nirbhiktapurvak apana apana vrutant mujhe bataao
 Hey Gaumata! Now you are free from fear
 main dushton ko dand detaa hoon
 Which evil has committed this stigma in the holy fame of the Pandavas by committing gross sins in my kingdom? Even if he is a sinful true God, i will cut off his hands too
 tab dharm bolaa - "he maharaj! aapane bhagwaan shrikrishna ke parambhakt pandavon ke kul main janm liya he atah ye vachan aap hi ke yogya hai
 Hey Rajan! We do not know who afflicts the creatures of the world
 shastron main bhi iskaa nirupan anek prakaar se kiya gaya he
 He who does not believe in duality accepts the cause of sorrow for himself
 koi praarabdh ko hi dukh kaa kaaran maanata he or koi karm ko hi dukh kaa nimitt samajhataa he
 Certain scholars consider nature and certain Gods to be the cause of sorrow
 atah he rajan! ab aap hi nishchit kijiye ki dukh kaa kaaran koun he
 " samraat parakshit us bail ke vachanon ko sun kar bole - "he vrishabh! aap avashya hi bail ke rup main dharm hai or yah gaurupini prithvi mata he
 You know the heart of religion very well
 aap kisi kii chugali nahin kar sakate isiliye aap dukh dene vaale kaa naam nahin bataa rahe hai
 o religion! Your tenacity, purity, mercy and truth were the four stages in the Satyuga
 treta main teen charan rah gayi, dwapar main do hi rah gayi or ab is dusht kaliyug ke kaaran aapkaa ek hi charan rah gaya he
 This unrighteous Kali Yuga is trying to destroy even that phase by its untruth
 bhagwaan shrikrishnachandra ke swadham gaman se dusht paapi shudra raja log is gaurupini prithvi ko bhogenge isi kaaran se yah mata bhi duhkhi hai
 " itnaa kah kar raja parikshith ne us paapi shudra rajveshadhari kaliyug ko maarane ke liye apni tikshn dhar vaali talwaar nikaali
 Kaliyug, fearful, took off his majestic dress and fell at the feet of King Parikshit and started saying tari-tahi
 raja parakshit bade sharnaagat vatsal the, unhone sharan main aaye huye kaliyug ko maarna uchit na samajha or kaliyug se kaha - "he kaliyug! tu mere sharan main aa gaya he isaliye maine tuje pranadan diya
 But only you are the root cause of wrongdoing, sin, lies, theft, treachery, poverty etc
 atah tu mere rajya se turant nikal ja or laut kar phir kabhi mat aana
 " raja parakshit ke in vachanon ko sun kar kaliyug ne kaatar vaani main kaha - "he rajan! aapkaa rajya to sampoorn prithvi par he, aapke rajya se baahar aisa koi bhi sthaan nahin he jahaan par ki main nivas kar sakun
 Hey Bhupathi! You are very kind, you have given me shelter
 ab dayaa karke mere nivas kaa bhi kuch na kuch prabandh aapako karnaa hi hoga
 " kaliyug is tarah kehane par raja parakshit soch main pad gayi
 After considering it, he said - "O Kali Yuga! Gaming, drinking, adultery and violence are inhabited by untruth, item, work and anger in these four places
 in chaar sthanon main nivas karne kii main tuje chhot detaa hoon
 "kali Yuga said this -" o Uttaranandan! These four places are insufficient for my residence
 dayaa karke koi or bhi sthaan mujhe dijiye
 "on asking for this kind of Kali Yuga, King Parikshit gave him the fifth place 'swarna'
 kaliyug in sthanon ke mil jane se pratyakshtah to vahaan se chalaa gaya kintu kuch dur jane ke baad adrushya rup main waapas aakar raja parakshit ke swarna mukut main nivas karne laga
 After this, he wandered a lot for the hunted prey and had a bad condition due to hunger and thirst

 rajmukut main baithe kalyug kii prarena se unki satvik buddhi bhrasht ho gai or unhone rishi ko dand dene kaa faisla kiya 
 But due to the good cremations of the king, he restrained himself from that sin
 krodh vash unhone mara hua saanp rishi ke gale main daal diya 
 The son of that Shamik Rishi, Shringiu was very strong and was bathing in the river at that time
 duusare rishi kumaro ne jaakar sara vritakan sunaaya 
 Hearing how a king has disowned his father, he became mad with anger and by filling the same river of river Shran with an anjuni, he cursed the king, the arrogant and foolish king who insulted my great father the same

 ambarish bhagwaan vishnu kaa mahaan bhakt tha or sach bolta tha
 Ambareesh performed a yagna with full devotion for the happiness, peace and prosperity of his kingdom
 Once, Ambareesh fasted on Ekadashi
 jisamen ekadshi ko vrath kii shuruuaat hogi or dwadashi ko vrath todaa jaataa he
 After breaking the fast, the sadhus have to provide food
 dwadashi ko jab vrath todna kareeb aayaa to ambarish ke ghar durvasa padhaare
 ambarish ne durvasa kaa sadar swaagat kiya
 Ambareesh urged him to dine
 durvasa ne ambarish kaa aagrah sweekaar kar liya or kaha ki jab tak wo nadi se snaan karke nahin aate tab tak wo vrath nahin tode
 kaaphi samay biit gaya, lekin durvasa nahin aae
 ambarish ko brat todna tha
 On the request of Guru Senior, Ambareesh broke the fast with the Tulsi team and started waiting for the sage
 Durvasa felt that Ambareesh insulted him by breaking the fast without coming to him
 gussaye durvasa ne apane jataa se ek rakshas paidaa kiya or use ambarish ko maarane ko kaha
 usee samay bhagwaan narayan ke sudarshan chakra ne rakshas kaa vadh kar diya or ambarish kii raksha kii
 iske baad sudarshan chakra durvasa kaa peechha karne laga
 bhay se kaatar durvasa ne pehle brahma or phir shiv ke paas apni raksha ke liye gaya
 Both expressed their inability to save Durvasa and said that they should apologize to Ambareesh
 Durvasa did the same
 ambarish ne bhagwaan vishnu ko yaad kiya or unase durvasa kii raksha ke liye prarthana kii
 haalanki shiv puraana main kahani thodi bhinn he
 According to the Shiva Purana, Ambareesh insulted Durvasa by breaking the fast before giving food to Durvasa
 isliye durvasa ne ambarish ko maarane kaa nirnay kar liya
 Sudarshan Chakra was born to save Ambareesh
 lekin durvasa ke rup main saakshaat shiv ko paakar vah ruk gaya
 At the same time, there was an AIR
 Nandi said that Shiva himself has come to take Ambareesh's exam, so he should apologize to him
 Ambareesh did the same and Durvasa blessed him

 orchestra = carthorse, a decimal point = I'm a dot in place
 anagram banane vaale ko anagramatist kehete hai
 The root word or phrase is known as the subject of anagram
 koi bhi shabd yaa vaakyansh jo varnon ko thik duusare kram main utpann karata he, vah anagram kehalaata he
 However, the goal of a serious or skilled anagrammatist is to create anagrams that somehow reflect or comment on the subject
 is tarah ke anagram apane vishay ke upshabd yaa viparitarthak shabd, ek parody, ek aalochana, yaa ek prashansa ho sakate hai; jaise, jorge bush = hi bagz gore ; madonna louis sicon = okeonal neude inakam yaa van kool dance muzician ; villium shakespeare = aay em a vikish spiler, roger medos-tailor = great vards yaa melody 
 The construction of an anagram involves a letter, the pattern of which is to be stored
 ek nipun anagram main, prayek varna bilkul utani hi baar upyog hona chahie jitani baar vah mul shabd yaa vaakyansh main upyog hua he; koi bhi parinaam jisamen is baat kaa dhyaan nahin rakhaa gaya ho, use apurna anagram kaha jaataa he
 Diacritics are usually disregarded and standard spellings are used
 anagram mosis ke samay main "themuru" yaa parivartan karne ke rup main dekhe ja sakate the, iskaa matlab hota tha naam kaa chupa hua yaa rahasyamay arth khojna

 Anagrams in Latin were considered saras for many centuries
 "est vir qui adest", jise neeche samajhaayaa gaya he, yah semul johnson kii a dictionari of da english languej main udhaaharan ke rup main udadhrut kiya gaya tha
 The meaning of any historical material on the anagram must always be seen in relation to the spelling and perception of the language at that time
 In English, in particular, the spelling gradually stabilized
 Attempts were made to regulate the anagram structure, one of the most significant in English was George Puttenham's The Anagram and Pozi Transposed in The Art of English Poise
 ek saahitiyik khel ke rup main jab latin saksharon kii saamaanya sampatti thi, tab latin anagram vishisht the: do udhaaharan hai, "ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum" kaa "virgo serena, pia, munda et immaculata" main parivartan or pilette ke prashan, "quid est veritas?" kaa anagramatik uttar
, arthath, "est vir qui adest" 
 inkaa mul dastavej nahin kiya gaya he
 Latin continued to influence character values
 If all the varnas were used once, it was an ongoing tradition to allow anagrams to become "perfect", but allowing this exchange
 This can be seen in a popular Latin anagram against the Jesuits: the change of "societas Jesu" to "vitiosa seces", or "cut of the Wicked Things"

 francois mairi aroet kaa naam "voltare" is swaroop main uchit bethata he or use "aroet, ai je" yani "aroet da yangar" kaa anagram banane kii anumati he
 Other examples: "arrigo Boita" = "tobio Gorio"; "edward Gore" = "ogredad Wiery", = "regira Dowdy" or = "E

 Many of these are "imperfect anagrams", with some characters omitted for easy pronunciation
 sheershakon ke liye istemaal kiye gaye anagramon main kuch prakaar kii haazirajavaabi ke liye gunjaaish hoti he

 He is called 'maithil Kokil' due to his kokil kirtha
 " Vidyapati composed poetry in Sanskrit, Avahatta, and Maithili
 iske ilaava bhuparikrama, purushapariksha, likhnaavali aadi anek rachanaayen sahitya ko deen
 The compositions named Kirtilata and Kirtipataka are written in Avahath
 padaavalee unki hindi-rachana he or vahi unki prasiddhi kaa kaaran hai
 In the phraseology, there are verses of krishna-radha adornment
 inke aadhaar par inhen hindi main radha-krishna-vishyak shringaari kavy ke janm daata ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The reason for Vidyapati being a Shringari poet is quite clear
 ve darbari kavi the or unke prayek pad par darbari vaataavaran kii chhap dikhaai detii he
 The verse depicts the Kami form of Krishna
 yahaan krishna jis rup main chitrit hai vaisaa chithran karne kaa dussahas koi bhakt kavi nahin kar saktaa
 Apart from this, Radha ji is also depicted as Mugdha heroine
 vidyapati vastav main kavi the, unase bhakt ke samaan apeksha karnaa thik nahin hoga
 From the description of the garland of pearls lying on the chest of the heroine, she can infer the emotional and aesthetic feeling of her poet's heart
 ek udhaaharan dekhie- The poetry of Vidyapati is an object of adornment and luxury, worship and worship is not his aim
 radha or krishna saadhaaran stripurush ke rup main paraspar prem karte hai
 Vidyapati himself has written in his work Kirtipataka - Because of Sita's enduring anguish, Rama had a keen desire to live with many women who are smart and intelligent, he took Krishnaavatar in various ways with Gopis
 atah spasht he ki swayan kavi kii drushti main krishna or radha shringaar ras ke nayak-nayika hi the
 Vidyapati has described the woman's fingernail in her poem, and originally used Shringar Ras
 isse spasht ho jaataa he ki unki shringaari manovriti thi
 Therefore, to expect devout like poetry from them is a kind of injustice to them
 un par gitgovind ke rachanaakaar jayadev kaa prabhaav he
 Shringar Rasa has been used extensively in Geetgovind, and the picture that Jayadev has presented in Shri Geetgovind of Krishna is exactly the same characterization Vidyapati has done in the verse
 spasht he jayadev or vidyapati ne jo chitra apni rachanaaon main prastut kiya he vah mahabharatakaleen dharmasthapana vaale shrikrishna se nitant bhinn he
 In the Mahabharata, where Radha appears as the motivating power of Shri Krishna, in the verse, Vidyapati finds the form of Radha inspired by the great desires of Krishna
 padaavalee main jo kuch varnit he usase koi bhi unhen bhakt kavi nahi maan saktaa kyonki bhakt kavi avane aradhy ko is prakaar shringaar se mandit karne kaa dussahas nahin kar saktaa
 In particular, the unadorned form of Radhakrishna presented in Dutti and Sakhi-education-context can only be done by any Shringari poet, not a devout poet
 atishay shringaar kaa ek varnan vidyapati kii padaavalee se dekhie- Some critics consider him a devotee as well
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki nimbark dwaara pratipaadit dwaitadvait siddhanth ke anuroop raganugabhakti kaa darshan inke padon main hota he or unke padon main radhakrishna kii lilaon ke varnan bhakthi-bhaavana ke pariprekshya main dekhe jane chahie
 Dr
 Grierson also writes in the same vein - Vidyapati's verse is almost all Vaishnava verse or hymn and all Hindus sing the verses of Vidyapati's verse without experiencing any work
 shri nagendra nath gupt ne to unhen bhakt pratipaadit karte hue vidyapati ke padon ko shuddh aadhyatmbhaav se yukt bataaya he
 Dr
 Janardhan Mishra considered Vidyapati's term full of spiritual thoughts and philosophical esoteric secrets
 dow shyamsundar das ke anusaar hindi ke vaishnav sahitya ke pratham kavi maithil kokil vidyapati hai
 His creations are steeped in the sacred love of Radha and Krishna
 kuch aalochakon kaa kahana he ki vidyapati ne padaavalee kii rachana vaishnav sahitya ke rup main kii he
 The tableau of the lovemaking idol of radha-krishna is visible in the poetry of the poet Geetgovindam
 unhone apane isht kii upasna saamaajik rup main kii he
 From this point of view, he has quoted the verses of Vidyapati which Vidyapati has written for the worship of Radha, Krishna, Ganesha, Shiva etc
 radha kii vandana-vishyak ek pad dekhie- Not only this, he has also prayed to many Gods, Radhakrishna, Durga, Shiva, Vishnu, Surya etc
 in the context of prayer and male-female
 kuch samalochak aise bhi hai jo vidyapati ke shringaarik padon kii ore dhyaan die bagaiyr hi unke prarthana sambandhi padon ke aadhaar par hi unhen bhakt kavi maan lete hai
 It is true that they have some devotional positions, but the composition of the adornments is more, even the adornments are too much described in the devotional positions
 vidyapati ke anek padon se yah spasht he ki vidyapati vastav main koi vaishnav nahin the, keval parampara ke anusaar hi unhone granth ke armbh main ganesh aadi kii vandana kii hai
 Their posts can also be divided into two parts
 1-radhakrishna vishyak 2 shivgauri sambandhi
 There is a lack of sublime and seriousness of devotion in the posts related to Radha Krishna and in these posts the smell of lust is clearly visible
 dharmikata, darshaniktaa yaa aadhyatmikta ko khojna asambhav he
 There is no color of lust in the terms related to Shiva and Gauri and they can be placed in the category of devotion
 10 In Radha Krishna-related verses, Vidyapati has described cosmic love
 radha or krishna saadhaaran stripurush kii hi tarah paraspar prem karte prathit hote hai tathaa bhakthi kii maatra na ke baraabar he
 In this way, it can be said that Vidyapati is a Shringari poet, in his footsteps, Madhurya can be seen on the steps
 unhone radhakrishna ke naamon kaa prayog aradhana ke liye nahin kiya he apitu saadhaaran nayak ke rup me pesh kiya he tathaa vidyapati kaa lakshya padaavalee main shringaar nirupan karnaa he
 The essence of the poet's poetry is permanent expression
 rajashrith rahete hue unhone raja kii prasannataa main shringaarparak rachanaaen hi kin, isamen sandeh nahin
 11 Additionally, in the time of Vidyapati, adornment was more important than devotion
 jayadev kii gitgovind jaisi rachanaaen isi koti kii he
 Mahakavi Vidyapati was a scholar of many languages like Sanskrit, Avhath, Maithili etc
 shaastra or lok donon hi sansar main unka asaadhaaran adhikaar tha
 Whether it is ritualism or religion, philosophy or justice, aesthetics or devotional work, viraha-vatha or convergence, anthem of the king or pindadan in Gaya for the general public, Vidyapati is known in all fields because of his classics
 
 mahakavi oinavaar rajvansh ke anek raajaaon ke shasankaal main virajman rahakar apane vaidushya evam doordarshita se unka maargdarshan karte rahe
 Prominent among the kings who honored Mahakavi with their honor: devsingh Kirtisingh shivsingh Padmasinh narsingh Dheersingh bhairavsingh or Chandra Singh

 Yet it seems logical that at first there was an outbreak of floods, which would have caused huge loss of public money, then later the epidemic spread due to rotting of dead bodies and other reasons and lack of food stuff which also left most of the people alive
 Some died and some went to distant places
