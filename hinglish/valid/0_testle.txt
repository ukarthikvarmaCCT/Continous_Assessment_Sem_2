 The Indus Valley Civilization is one of the major civilizations of the ancient river valley civilizations in the world
 jo mukhya rup se dakshin asia ke uttar-pashchimi kshetron main, jo aaj tak uttar purv afghanistan ,pakistan ke uttar-pashchim or uttar bharat main faili he
 Along with the ancient civilizations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of the three earliest chronologies of the civilizations of the ancient world, and of these three, the most widespread and most discussed
 sammanit patrika nechar main prakashit shodh ke anusaar yah sabhyataa kam se kam 8000 varsh puraani he
 It is also known as the Harappan civilization and the 'indus-saraswati civilization'
 iskaa vikaas sindhu or ghaghghar / hakadaa ke kinare hua
 Mohenjodaro, Kalibanga, Lothal, Dholavira, Rakhigarhi and Harappa were its major centers
 disambar 2014 main bhirdana ko sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa ab tak kaa khoja gaya sabase pracheen nagar mana gaya he
 Archaeologists and historians based on the excavations in the British period have estimated that it was a highly developed civilization and these cities have been inhabited and destroyed many times

 In 1856 Cunningham surveyed about this civilization
 1856 main karachi se lahore ke madhya railway line ke nirmaan ke dauraan bartan bandhuon dwaara hadappa sthal kii soochna sarkaar ko di
 In this sequence, in 1861, under the direction of Alexander Cunningham, the Archaeological Department of India was established
 1904 main lard karjan dwaara jon marshall ko bhartiya puratathvik vibhaag kaa mahanideshak banaaya gaya
 Fleet wrote an article about this old civilization
 1921 main dayaram saahani ne hadappa kaa utkhanan kiya
 Thus this civilization was named Harappan civilization and Dayaram Sahni was considered its explorer
 yah sabhyataa sindhu nadi ghati main faili hui thi isliye iskaa naam sindhu ghati sabhyataa rakhaa gaya
 Due to the rise of cities for the first time, it is also called the first urbanization
 pratham baar kaansya ke prayog ke kaaran ise kaansya sabhyataa bhi kaha jaataa he
 1400 centers of Indus Valley Civilization have been discovered, of which 925 centers are in India
 80 pratishat sthal saraswati nadi or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke aas-paas he
 So far only 3 percent of the total discoveries have been excavated
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa kaa kshetra atyant vyapak tha
 Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjodaro have provided evidence of this civilization
 atah vidwaanon ne ise sindhu ghati kii sabhyataa kaa naam diya, kyonki yah kshetra sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra main aate hai, par baad main ropar, lothal, kalibanga, vanamali, rangapore aadi kshetron main bhi is sabhyataa ke avshesh mili jo sindhu or uski sahaayak nadiyon ke kshetra se baahar the
 Therefore, many historians consider it more appropriate to name this civilization as "harappan civilization", being the main center of this civilization
 bhartiya puraatatv vibhaag ke mahanideshak jon marshall ne 1924 main sindhu sabhyataa ke bare main teen mahatvapurn granth likhe
 The area of this civilization was many times larger and larger than the area of all ancient civilizations of the world
 is paripakv sabhyataa ke kendra-sthal punjab tathaa sindh main tha
 Subsequently, it expanded in the south and east direction
 is prakaar hadappa samskruti ke antargat punjab, sindh or baluchistan ke bhaag hi nahin, balki gujarat, rajasthan, haryana or pashchimi uttar pradesh ke seemaant bhaag bhi the
 Its spread ranged from Rahmandheri in the north to Daimabad in the south and Sutkagandor of Makran beach in Balochistan in the west to Meerut and Kurukshetra in the northeast
 praarambhik vistaar jo praapt tha usamen sampoorn kshetra tribhujaakar tha is tarah yah kshetra aadhunik pakistan se to bada he hi, pracheen misr or mesopotamia se bhi bada he
 In the third and second millennium BC, the area of any civilization throughout the world was not larger than the Harappan culture
 ab tak bhartiya upmahadweep main is samskruti ke kul 1000sthalon kaa pataa chal chukaa he
 Some of these are in the initial stage, some are in the mature stage and some are in the later stage

 Only half a dozen of these can be called city

 Both places are in present-day Pakistan

 The third city was Mohen, which was 130 km south of Daro, at the site of Chanhudaro and the fourth city at a place called Lothal above the Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat

 All these sites have views of mature and advanced Harappan culture

 The specialty of these two is to be a city fortress

 Charles Mann first came to know of this civilization in 1826
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke pramukh shahar teen deshon main is prakaar he:- The various cities of India have the following cities of the Indus Valley Civilization: - is sabhyataa kii sabase vishesh baat thi yahaan kii viksit nagar nirmaan yojana
 Both Harappa and Mohan Joddo had their fortifications where the family of the ruling class lived
 prayek nagar main durg ke baahar ek usase nimna str kaa shahar tha jahaan eenton ke makaanon main saamaanya log rahete the
 The special thing about these city buildings was that they were configured like traps
 yani sadake ek duusare ko samakon par katati thim or nagar anek ytaakar khandon main vibhakt ho jaataa tha
 This was applicable to all Indus settlements whether they were small or big
 hadappa tathaa mohan jodado ke bhawan bade hote the
 The monuments there are proof that the rulers there were the ultimate skilled in labor mobilization and tax collection
 eenton kii badi-badi imaarat dekh kar saamaanya logon ko bhi yah lagegaa ki ye shaasha kitne pratapi or pratishthavan the
 By far the most famous site of Mohan Jodaro is the huge public bath, whose reservoir is in the mound of the fort
 yah into ke sthapaty kaa ek sundar udhaaharan he
 It is 11
88 meters long, 7
01 meters wide and 2
43 meters deep
 dono siron par tal tak jane kii seedhiyaan lagi hai
 There are change rooms next to the clothes
 snanagar kaa farsh paki eenton kaa bana he
 There is a big well in the nearby room whose water was taken out and put in hose
 hauz ke kone main ek nirgam he jisase pani bahakar naale main jaataa tha
 It is believed that this huge bath will be built for the religious bath which has traditionally been necessary for religious work in India
 mohan jodado kii sabase bada sanrachana he - anaaj rakhane kaa kothaar, jo 45
71 meter lanbaa or 15
23 meter chaudaa he
 Six rooms have been found in the fort of Harappa, which stand in two rows on a platform of bricks
 har ek kothaar 15

 lanbaa tathaa 6
09 me
 chaudaa he or nadi ke kinare se kuch ek meter kii duuri par he
 The floor area of these twelve units is about 838
125 square meters
 Which is almost as much as that of Mohan Jodro's storeroom
 hadappa ke kothaaron ke dakshin main khulaa farsh he or isapar do kataron main eent ke vrittakar chabutare bane hue hai
 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor
 isse prathit hota he ki in chabutaron par fasal kii dawni hoti thi
 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat
 banaavali main mila jau unnat kism kaa he
 Apart from this, they also produced sesame and mustard
 sabase pehle kapaas bhi yaheen paidaa kii gai
 In the name of this, the people of Greece started saying this sign
 hadappa yonto ek krishi pradhan samskruti thi par yahaan ke log pashupaalan bhi karte the
 Bull-cow, buffalo, goat, sheep and boar were reared
 harappai logon ko hathi tathaa gande kaa gyaan tha
 Many businesses were prevalent in the cities here
 mitti ke bartan banane main ye log bahut kushal the
 Different types of paintings were made on pottery with black color
 kapadaa banane kaa vyavsaay unnat avasthaa main tha
 It was also exported abroad
 johari kaa kaam bhi unnat avasthaa main tha
 The work of making bead and amulets was also popular, yet no iron item has been found
 atah siddh hota he ki inhen lohe kaa gyaan nahin tha
 People here used to trade stones, metal scales etc
 among themselves
 ek bade bhubhag main dher sari sil, ekarup lipi or manakikrut maap taul ke pramaan mili hai
 He was familiar with the wheel and probably used a vehicle similar to today's aces
 ye afghanistan or iran se vyapaar karte the
 They established a commercial colony in northern Afghanistan that facilitated trade
 bahut si harappai sil mesopotamia main mili hai jinase lagata he ki mesopotamia se bhi unka vyapaar sambandh tha
 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log apane shavon ko jalaayaa karte the, mohan jodado or hadappa jaise nagaron kii aabaadi kareeb 50 hazaar thi par phir bhi vahaan se keval 100 ke aasapaas hi kabre mili he jo is baat kii or ishaara karata he ve shav jalaate the
 Havan blunts have been found at Lothal, Kalibanga etc
, which is a proof of their being Vedic
 yahan swaastik ke chitra bhi mili he
 Some scholars believe that Hinduism was the original religion of Dravida and that Shiva was the god of Dravida whom the Aryans adopted
 kuch jain or buddha vidwaan yah bhi maanate he ki sindhu ghati sabhyataa jain yaa buddha dharm ke the, par mukhyadhara ke itihaaskaaron ne yah baat nakaar di or iske adhik pramaan bhi nahin he
 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship
 jaise aaj hindu ganga main nahaane jate he vaise hi saindhav log yahan nahaakar pavitra hua karte the

 There is a feeling that this civilization was in its last phase decadent

 It seems that there was not a single reason for the decline of this civilization, but because of a combination of different reasons

 Well-known scientist Sir James Jean writes in the role of a book called 'pathology of Science and Philosophy' - "the boundary line of philosophy and science which had become fruitless in a way; the same extent of development in the near future of conceptual material science
 The line has become important and attractive
 " The war, which was considered to be the path of philosophy and science till now, has come to an end
 vastusthiti yah he kii darshan bhi maanav mastishk main aaye 'ki tatvam' kaa samaadhaan he or vigyaan kaa laksh bhi satya kya he ? yatharthata kya he ? ise samaj lenaa he
 The word of philosophy contains the breadth of life
 vishwa kya he ? main kya hoon ?in sthitiyon ko samaj lene or tadnurup apni manzil kii ore aage badhanaa darshan kaa ek purna swaroop ban jaataa he
 That is why the philosophers said - Grief Jihasa and Sukh Lipsa is the goal of life
 vichaar kshetra main gyaan or shiya ne do rup le liye hai, yah bhi bahujan sammat tathy he
 What is the element here? The solution to this question is philosophy, and after knowing it, it is the nature of the world, it is the position of the soul in it and through these efforts and means the soul achieves its ultimate goal salvation, it is religion to conduct in this way
 aatma kii mukti main darshan or dharm donon kaa samaan mahatv he
 That is why it is said - "gyan Riyabhiyan Moksha:" jahaan ham vigyaan ke lakshya or paribhaasha kii charchaa karte hai vahaan keval jaan lene maatr kaa aagrah miltaa he
 Continue to unravel the mysteries of the universe and find the truth, there is nothing to be found there
 darshan ko bahut saare log sahi rup se nahin jaan paae hai
 According to him, different religions run by different people have different philosophies
 isliye ve sochate he darshan yukti-pradhan he
 But the situation is completely different from this
 darshan kaa janm hi tark kii bhoomika par hua he
 Shraddha Yuga was before Darshan Yuga
 mahavir buddha kapil aadi mahapurushon ne jo kuch kaha wo isi pramaan se satya mana jaataa tha kii yah mahavir ne kaha he or yah buddha yaa kapil ne kaha he jis purush main jisaki shraddha thi us purush ke vachan hi us ke liene shaastra the
 The era of logic arrived
 manushya sochane laga - us purush ne kaha he is liye ham satya maane esa kyon ? satya kaa mandand tark, yukti vah pramaan hona chahie
 This is where philosophy emerged
 is liye yah maanakar chalanaa agyaan he ki darshan tark pradaan na hokar keval shraddha pradaan he
 History of science is very different from philosophy
 vigyaan kii aadhaar bhoomika par kisi param purush kii pramanikta nahin maani gai he
 The idea of thinking of science has gone as an independent stream, overcoming controversial decisions of religion and philosophy
 hamaara satya sadaa asandigdh or ek rup rahe isliye vaigyanikon ne prayog or anveshanon ko hi apana pramaan mana
 In the definition of science, truth is considered to be the one that has been marked by laboratories and observatories; But it was not so easy to find the truth as he had understood
 vigyaan kaa itihaas uthaakar yadi ham ek tatasth adhyayan karte he to prati prishth par vahaan badalte hue nirnay paae jate he
 Regarding the speed-assisted ether, what the scientists have considered minimum, how many new decisions have been made on the basis of how many experiments so far and today Prof
 How Albert Einstein has made it existentially zero
 parmaanu ke vishay me demokerates se lekar anu bam va udajan bam tak ke is yug main kitne navinnirnyon kii shrukhrila bani he
 The history of the atom is not only indicative of unified evolution; It is also a library of various decisions
 use yadi ham shramit vikaas kaa pratik bhi maane to bhi yah prashn to hameshaa hi saamne rahegaa-kal kaa satya yada aaj badal gaya to aaj kaa satya kya kal tak thahar sakegaa ? surya, chandra, prithvi tathaa anya grah ganon kii gati, sthiti or swaroop ke vishay main tolamike yug kii baat kopernicus ke yug main nahin rahi or kopernicus ke nirnyon par ainstin kaa saapekshavaad ek nayaa rup lekar aa dhamkata he
 Should we think Einstein's decisions in this regard are final? vigyaan jis ahm se darshan ko ek durbal mastishk kii upaj maanakar aage bada tha, prakruti ne us aham ko adhik din nahin jeene diya
 Today science itself is doubtful in all its decisions
 prakruti ke nae rahasyon ko jayon jyon vah apane haathon kholta jaataa he, apana agyaan kitna bada he yah samajhane kii bhoomika banaata jaataa he
 In scientific world these words are echoing around today- "ham log hamaare agyaan kaa failaav kitna bada he, yah or acchhee tarah se samajhane or mahasoos karne lage hai
 "sir James Jean writes-" It may be better that the advertisement should cease making new announcements, because the river of knowledge has flowed back to its source
 " In another place he writes - "the great invention of the twentieth century is not the theory of relativism nor nuclear division
 is sadi kaa mahaan avishkaar to yah he ki vastuen waisi nahin he jaisi ki ve dikhti he
 The common thing with this is that we have not yet reached the ultimate reality
 " In this way, we easily reach the decision that science had rebelled with philosophy and the free path to reach the ultimate truth was not so straightforward as it was understood
 phir bhi hamen samaj lenaa chahie ki darshan or vigyaan main sangharsh se kahi adhik samanvay he
 There is a very long knowledge tradition behind philosophy, there is a fervent craving for eclipse in science
 jo asaty laga use pakade rahane kaa agrah vaigyanikon ne kabhi nahin kiya
 As Darshan later made many paths - 'vedic philosophy', 'buddhist philosophy', 'jain philosophy' etc
, thus, different paths have not yet emerged in philosophy
 sabhi vaigyanik aaj nahin to kal ek hi maarg par aa jate hai
 Both philosophy and science have independent importance in terms of utility in life
 donon hi satya kii manzil tak pahunchne ke maarg hai parantu darshan kaa vikaas mukhyatya aatmavaad ke rup main nikharaa
 This gives man self-realization, Kaivalya and Dhriti, forgiveness, satisfaction, non-violence, truth, etc
 bhautik samarthy ke abhaav main manushya ji saktaa he, vah bhi anand se, par aadhyatmik va naitik samarthy ke bina bhautik sadhano ke dher main dhab marane ke sivaay manushya ke paas koi chaara nahin rah jaataa

 Classical texts such as the Srimad Bhagavat Maha Purana and the 'mahabharata' are the result of the combined long-form writing tradition of many sages-scholars, as Ved Vyasa is not the name of a single individual, an 'academic post' assumed by various scholars from time to time
 ) But a single writer has prepared such a huge manuscript, it is rare to find such a unique example in the literary history of Sanskrit

 Rajasthan Maharasthana Foundation of Jodhpur has published this Maharana in 4 volumes under the editing of Lakshminarayan Goswami

 Handwritten copies of some of his compositions are also in the Pothikhana of Jaipur as mentioned in this list
 yadhyapi prakaash parimal jaise anusandhankartaaon ne shivanand ji kaa janm vikram samvath 1710 ankit kiya he, tathaapi unki laghu-pustak main is tathy ke sakshya kaa koi pramaan uplabdh nahin hota
 The truth is that in which year and where he was born, it is a matter of research
 is kaa kaaran keval yah he ki puraane jamaane main mahaan se mahaan lekhak tak apane nijee-jivan ke bare main koi soochna yaa jaankaree apni kritiyon main aksar nahin dete the
 In that era, to remain completely secret or unaware and to engage in high level silent saraswat-sadhana would have been the internal psychopathy of many scholars like Shivanand ji
 aisa anumaan bahuprachlit he ki anek nareshon ke sammanit kulguru hone ke baavjood, apana antim samay goswamiji ne bikaner ke maharaja anupasingh ke aagrah par unke saath hi vyateet kiya
 But where Shivanand Goswami died - somewhere in South India, or in Bikaner - is a matter of research
 shivanand goswami chanderi ke governor devisingh bundela ke samakaleen the, jinhone goswamiji se 'mantra-diksha' lekar bhent main kuch gaanvon kii jaagir bakshi thi
 Similarly, the seventh generation king of Orchha, Devi Singh, was impressed by his scholarship and gave a jagir of 4 villages
 jaipur raja vishnusingh ne san 1692-1694 isvi main inhen ramjipura, harivanshpura, chimanpura or mahapura graamon kii jaagir bhent kii thi, jiskaa pramaan jaipur ke pothikhana ke abhilekh main aaj bhi surakshit he
 Today Mahapura village has become a part of the Jaipur metropolis, which is situated on Ajmer road, 10 km from Jaipur
 mahapura main goswami ji ke or unke bhai janardan goswami ke vanshaj pidiyon tak nivas karte rahe
 It was here that in 1922, the famous Sanskrit litterateur Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri was married to Ramadevi Bhatt, the daughter of Acharya Gopikrishna Goswami of Srimad Bhagwat, a descendant of Shivanandji
 bikaner ke maharaja anup singh dwaara goswamiji ko do gaanvon - pulasar or chilkoi kii jaagir bhent kii gai thi
 He stayed in Bikaner in the evening of his life
 sambhawatah inkaa dehavsaan bhi vahiin hua ho- kintu inke antim dinon ke bare main koi aitihaasik saamagree uplabdh nahin hoti| After Shivanand ji, his sons also continued to achieve many achievements in royalty, keeping their clan tradition intact, as evidenced by the following English document- 'maharaj shri Shivanandji, sole ascendant, gave purnabhishek-mantra to Maharaja Shri Anoop Singh ji Bahadur of Bikaner at Dilsuri 
 The Maharaja bequeathed two villages CHIKLOI and POOLASAR in Bhent on this most auspicious occasion to Shri Shivanandji Maharaj, the Rajguru
 Thus Goswami Paramsukhji Maharaj, the youngest son of great Shri Shivanandji Maharaj settled at Bikaner on the request of HH Shri Gajsingh ji Bahadur,the Maharaja of Bikaner
 Shri Suratsinghji, Maharaja of Bikaner also accepted Purnabhishek Mantra from Goswami Shri Paramsukhji Maharaj, the Rajguru, in 1855 AD and bequeathed the village KHETOLAI in Bhent and bequeathed on the most auspicious occasion of the sacred thread ceremony of Bishwnathji and kanhaiyalalji, real sons of shri Paramsukhji Goswami, village SURJANSAR devisingh ke darbari vidvan unke viruddh anek prakaar ke pravaad unki anupasthiti main bana kar raja ke kaan bharte rahete the| yah baat to sarvavidit thi ki orchha yaa bundelon ke isht devtaa, bhagwaan ram the or isi kaaran is kshetra main anek ram or hanuman mandiron kii sthapana bhi hui he, vaise orchha main hi bundelon ke isht hanumanji kaa ek mandir aaj bhi he| yah mandir shivanandji ke ashram or devisingh ke mehalon ke bich padataa tha
 The scholars of Shivanand complained to the king that the temple of the presiding deity of Bundelkhand, while on the way, never bowed down to his guru, the presiding deity
 When King Devisingh himself presented the same thing in front of them, he avoided it in humor, saying that "this matter is of personal reverence and since i am absorbed in the feeling of Ahornish Devi, therefore going into the 'other' sense in it Mine and yours will be evil! All gods are the form of God anyway
 

 " inke uttar se raja kadaachit puri tarah santusht nahin ho sakaa
 So once both of them were coming through the path of the same Hanuman temple, the king begged them to bow down to their favorite Hanuman
 kehete hai- jaise hi shakti ke param aradhak shivanandji ne apane haath pranaam hetu uthaae, usase purv hi hanumanji kii murti main pathar fatne kii awaz ke saath upar se neeche tak ek gahari daraar pads gayi! raja is chamatkaar se bahut bhaybheet ho gaya
 And since then, a deep loyalty to Adyashakti has also awakened in his mind
 orchha main hanuman mandir main aaj bhi vah gahari daraar dekhi ja sakati he
 


 After this incident, Shivanand Goswami's mind became somewhat unsympathetic to the learned politicians and devout politicians in the court on the strength of miracles
 unhone "sankshep-praayshchitt" or "vyavhaar-nirnay" jaise granth likh kar apane isht ke samaksh praayshchitt kiya
 


 " aurangzeb shashan ke dauraan amer ke rajya par aaye rajnatik-sankaton ke nivaaran ke liye jaipur ke tatkaaleen panditon ne maharaja vishnusingh ko nagar main shanti banaaye rakhane ke liye 'vaajapeya-yajna' karwaane kaa mashvira diya tha
 Then some pandits of Kashi and Mithila were very famous for their cultivation and siddhis
 amer ke naresh ne unhen hi is kaam ke liye jaipur aamantrit kiya
 But whenever there was a veela of Purnahuti in that royal Vajpayee-yajna due to misuse, the sacrificial priest would die accidentally
 This happened many times, not once
 ek ke baad ek kaashi-mithila ke paanch siddh purohit yajna puraa karaane se purv hi kaal-kavlit ho gaye
 Seeing such a terrible vengeance, the king sent a message through Bikaner King Anupsinh to Orchha Maharaj that he should kindly send his vice-chancellor and the great Tantric Shivanandji to Jaipur so that he can get the vajpayee-yajna done
 Shivanand Goswami finally reached Amer in 1680 AD and near the Jalmahal, he completed the vajpayee-yajna of Jaipur King uninterrupted
 The night before Purnahuti, it is said that a formidable Brahmarakshas appeared before Goswamiji in a dream - who challenged him to debate with the information that the earlier five kashi-pandits had become his grasps by defeating him in debate
 goswamiji ne brahmarakshas kii is chunauti ko sweekaar kiya or use shastrarth main haraa kar vaajapeya-yajna purnahuti ke saath vidhivat sampann karaayaa| But to disguise the fact that the first five kashi-pandits had defeated the Brahmarakshas in scripture and become his morsels, the king returned to Mahapura from Amber without any alms from Amber Maharaja
 It is said that when Maharaja Vishnusinh sensed Shivanandji's displeasure, he persuaded himself to reach Mahapura with his son Sawai Jai Singh
 Shivanandji, while making some very accurate predictions about Sawai Jai Singh, instructed the Maharaja that he go to some well-known ritualist Pandit and send Kashi for the 'pratamukti' of Brahmarakshas
 He somewhat unhappily held the Maharaja responsible for the killing of the five Pandits, He would have been advised to get Ashwamedha Yagya done as a result of citing many ancient scriptures
 Being distressed by the death of innocent Brahmins, he also showed humility in front of Maharaja in Mahapura and reluctance to stay
 Goswamiji eventually left the estate of five villages with his younger brother to Maharaja Anoop Singh as the Rajguru of Bikaner "after some time" - whose invitation / request to be Bikaner vice-chancellor-rajguru has been pending with him ever since

 The Indian National Congress, mostly known as the Congress, is one of the two major political parties in India, among which are the other Bharatiya Janata Party

 In the late 19th and early to mid-20th century, the Congress became a central partner in the Indian freedom struggle, with more than 1
5 crore members and more than 70 million participants, opposing British colonial rule
 1947 main aazaadee ke baad, congress bharat kii pramukh raajnneetik party ban gai
 Out of 16 general elections from independence to 2016, Congress has won an absolute majority in 6 and led the ruling coalition in 4; Hence, she was a part of the Central Government for a total of 49 years
 bharat main, congress ke saat pradhanmantri rah chuke hai; pehle jawaharlal nehru the or haal hi main manmohan singh the
 In the 2014 general election, the Congress held the worst general electoral performance ever and won only 44 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha
 tab se lekar ab tak congress kai vivaadon main ghiri hui he, congress dwaara bhartiya army kaa manobal giraane kaa desh main virodh kiya ja rahaa he 
 The history of the Indian National Congress goes through two different periods
 sthapana The Indian National Congress was established on 28 December 1885 at Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College, Bombay, with an attendance of 72 delegates
 iske sansthaapak mahasachiv e o hum the jinhone kalkatte ke vyomesh chandra banerjee ko adhyaksh niyukt kiya tha
 In its early days Congress had a vision of an elite institution
 iske shuruaati sadsy mukhya rup se bombai or madras presidency se liye gayi the
 Swaraj's goal in Congress was first adopted by Bal Gangadhar Tilak
 praarambhik varsh In 1907, two parties were formed in the Congress - the hot party and the soft party
 garam dal kaa netritv bal gangadhar tilak, lala lajpat raay evam bipin chandra paal kar rahe the
 The soft team was led by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Ferozeshah Mehta and Dada Bhai Naoroji
 garam dal purna swaraj kii maang kar rahaa tha parantu naram dal british raaj main swashaasan chahta tha
 After the outbreak of the First World War, at the Lucknow meeting of 1916, the two parties reunited and the Home Rule Movement was started, under which the British Raj demanded an official position for India
 congress ek jan andolan ke rup main But with Gandhiji's arrival in India in 1915, there was a big change in the Congress
 champaran evam kheda main bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ko jan samarthan se apni pehali safalataa mili
 Gandhi became Congress general secretary in 1919 after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre
 unke maargdarshan main congress kuleen vargeey sanstha se badalakar ek janasamudaay sanstha ban gayi

 Since the independence of India in 1947, the Indian National Congress has been one of the main political parties in India
 is dal ke kai pramukh netaa bharat ke pradhanmantri rah chuke hai
 Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi and her grandson Rajiv Gandhi were from this party

 Currently his son Rahul Gandhi serves as the National President of Congress, Kapil Sibal, Congress General Secretary Digvijay Singh, Ahmed Patel, Rashid Alvi, Raj Babbar, Manish Tiwari are the senior leaders of the Congress
 bharat ke purv pradhanmantri dow manmohan singh bhi congress se taalluk rakhte hai
 Nehru / Shastri era indira yug Rajiv Gandhi and Rao era aadhunik yug The Congress is a civil nationalist party that follows a form of nationalism, which supports values such as freedom, tolerance, equality and individual rights
 congress ek party ne hokar ek vichaardhaara he From time to time, various leaders opposed the policies of the Congress and struggled to remove it

 twodel swanim ko amoort kaalpanik ikai maanate hai
 Swan or sound-change do not always mean change, while phonem-change is sure to mean change
 swanim uccharit bhashaa kii aisi laghuttam ikai he, jisase do dhvaniyon kaa antar spasht hota he
 Thus it is also clear that phonemes is related to sound
 dhwani kaa sambandh yadi uccharan se hota he, to shravan se bhi iskaa atoot sambandh hota he
 If the sound is not heard then its existence will also be doubtful
 dhwani ke uccharan tathaa shravan-sambandhon ke hi kaaran swanim ko sharir-vigyaan tathaa bhautik vigyaan se sambandhit kaha gaya he, kyonki uccharan or shravan-prakriya yadi sharir vigyaan se sambandhit hoti he, to sanvahan-prakriya purnatah bhautik vigyaan se
 The basic sounds of any language range from about fifteen to fifty
 inhen dhvaniyon ke nirdhaaran par swanim kaa nirdhaaran hota he
 The difference between the sounds is displayed through the phoneme itself

 'jaan' tathaa 'paan' kaa antar swanim kii bhinnata ke hi aadhaar par hota he
 Here 'H' and 'P' are two different meaningful sounds
 inhen bhinn sarthak dhvaniyon ke aadhaar par ‘gyaan’ tathaa ‘paan’ main arth bhinnata bhi he
 These meaningful sounds are called phonemes in phonology
 un do shabdo kii 'na' dhvaniyon main sookshm antar he, kyonki koi bhi vyakti yadi ek dhwani ko do baar uccharan karegaa, to unamem sookshm antar hona swaabhaavik he; yatha- paan, jaan, pani, manu, minu, maane, maano aadi shabdon kii vibhinn ‘na’ dhvaniyon main saamaanya rup se koi antar nahin lagata he, kintu sookshm chintan par in dhvaniyon main sookshm bhinnata kaa gyaan hota he
 If there is a difference in them phonetically, then there is a sufficient similarity in the concept of phonemes on the basis of the place, effort and reason of pronunciation
 swanim rekhankan ke liye is prakaar kaa aadhaar apanaate hai- camel ko / k / m / l When there is no change of meaning even when there is difference in sound, it is called free distribution
 hindi main swanim ke aise prayog mil jate hai; yatha- diwaar > diwathall, gam > gam
 Here the whole environment is the same except for the / r / - / l in the first word and / c / - / c / in the second word
 iske liye ~ chinh kaa prayog karte hai; yatha- diwaar > diwaal / r / ~ / l
 If there is a change of meaning when used in the beginning, middle and end of a word, the phonemes form becomes fixed; For example, by using 'h' in the beginning and end of the word 'you', the meaning-changed forms are found in this way - is prakaar 'ja' swanim he
 'L' can show phonemes as follows - pravartit dhwani keval aadi main he, iske arth main parivartan bhi nahin hota
 Lastly, it is not phoneme
