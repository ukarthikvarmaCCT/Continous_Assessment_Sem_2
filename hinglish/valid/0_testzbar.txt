 It is Shani Dev's task to pay the full amount as the native has done
 shani kii mani neelam he
 The amount of iron in the body of an animal is more than all the metals, as the amount of iron in the body decreases, its movement becomes difficult again
 or sharir main kitne hi rog paidaa ho jate hai
 That is why the people born due to its iron deficiency do not benefit from eating the medicine, then the native should understand that Saturn is doing poorly
 shani makar tathaa kumbh raashi kaa swami he
 It is experienced in high Libra and in low Aries
 isaki dhaatu loha, anaaj chanaa, or daalon main udud kii daal maani jaati he
 Only three benches are considered to be main among the miraculous Siddha Peethas of Saturn, the person gets immediate benefit by coming down in these sins due to going to these Siddha Peethas and asking for forgiveness of sins committed by him
 jo log in chamatkaarik peethon ko kori kalpana maanate hai, uanke prati keval itnaa hi kaha ja saktaa he, ki unke puraane punya karmon ke anusaar jab tak unka jivan sucharu rup se chal rahaa tabhi tak thik kaha ja saktaa he, bhavishya me jab kathinaayee saamne aayegi, to ve bhi in siddh peethon ke liye dhundte firenge, or unako bhi yaad aayegaa ki kabhi kisi ke prati makhul kiya tha
 If there was no recognition for these Siddha Peeths, intelligent people would have been born like any number of them three and a half thousand years ago, and would have died while doing their own work
 People's recognition is the same today
 shinganapur gaanv me shanidev kaa adbhut chamatkaar he
 Till date no one has locked his house in this village, it can be guessed by this how greatness is in this proven back
 aaj tak ke itihaas main kisi chor ne aakar is gaanv main chori nahi kii, agar kisi ne prayaas bhi kiya he to vah foran hi peedit ho gaya
 Visiting, worshiping, oil bathing, getting Shani Dev done instantly reduces Shani sufferings, but he only reaches here, on top of which Shani Dev is blessed
 mahavir hanumanji ke dwaara lanka se fenka hua alokik shanidev kaa pind he, shanishchari amaavashya ko yahaan mela lagata he
 And the native hugs Shani Dev by pouring oil on him
 saath hi pahane huye kapadey juute aadi vahiin par chod kar samast daridrata ko tyaag kar or cleshon ko chod kar apane apane gharon ko chale jate hai
 Even after worshiping this Peeth one gets instant fruit
 logon kii hansi karne kii aadat he
 People who did not understand listening to the Pushpak Vimana of Ramayana, used to laugh, unless they see Rameswaram themselves, stones can also float in the water, there is no faith, but when going to Ramkund Visited that stone and found it floating in the water, i could not understand anything except salutations
 jab bhagwaan shri krishna kaa banshi bajaata hua ek pair se khada hua rup dekha to samaj main aayaa ki vidwaanon ne shani dev ke beej mantra main jo beej kaa achhar chunaa he, vah agar rekhaankit rup se sajaa diya jaye to vah or koi nahi swayan shanidev ke rup me bhagwaan shri krishna hi maane jaayenge
yah siddh peeth kosi se chha: kilometre dur or nand gaanv se sata hua kokila van he, is van main dwapar yug main bhagwaan shri krishna jo solah kala sampoorn ishwar hai, ne shani ko kahawaton or puraanon kii kathaon ke anusaar darshan diya, or aashirwad bhi diya ki yah van unka he, or jo is van kii parikrama karegaa, or shanidev kii puja archana karegaa, vah meri krupa kii tarah se hi shanidev kii krupa praapt kar sakegaa
or jo bhi jataka is shani siddh peeth ke prati darshan, puja paath kaa antermukhi hokar sadbhaavna se vishwaas karegaa, vah bhi shani ke kisi bhi updrav se grast nahi hoga
yahaan par shanivaar ko mela lagata he
 The Jataka performs a Dandavat Parikrama in his own devotion, or does a Parikrama, those who revolve by reciting Shani Dev's King Dasharatha Stotra, or chanting the seed mantra of Shani, early attainment of good fruits
 It happens
 jyotish ke anusaar shani kii sadhesati kii manyatayen teen prakaar se hoti hai, pehali lagan se duusari chandra lagan yaa raashi se or teesri surya lagan se, uttar bharat main chandra lagan se shani kii saade saati kii gananaa kaa vidhaan pracheen kaal se chalaa aa rahaa he
 According to this belief, when Shanidev travels through the moon sign, it is considered as Sadesati, its effect is experienced from thirty months before coming to the zodiac and till after thirty months
 sadhesati ke dauraan shani jataka ke piale kiye gayi karmon kaa hisaab usee prakaar se letaa he, jaise ek ghar ke naukar ko puri jimmedaari dene ke baad maalik kuch samay baad hisaab maangata he, or hisaab main bhul hone par yaa galti karne par jis prakaar se sajaa naukar ko di jaati he usee prakaar se sajaa shani dev bhi har praani ko dete hai
 And not only this, those who have done good deeds, then also give sardhati prizes to them, such as being made the head of a city or village or the city, etc
 Sanyasati's narrative of Shani is received by many people, like King Vikramaditya, Raja Nal, King Harishchandra, also harasses Saturn's saintly saintly Mahatmas, who begin to indulge in Joga along with Bhoga
 har manushya ko tees saal me ek baar sadhesati avashya aati he, yadi yah saade saati dhanu, min, makar, kumbh raashi me hoti he, to kam peedajanak hoti he, yadi yah sadhesati chauthe, chathe, aathven, or barahawein bhav main hogi, to jataka ko avashya dukhi karegi, or tino sukh shaareerik, maansik, or aarthik ko haran karegi
in sadhesatiyon main kabhi bhuulakar bhi "neelam" nahi dhaaran karnaa chaiye, yadi kiya gaya to vajaay laabh ke haani hone kii puri sambhaavna hoti he
 Do not forget any new work, new industry, even in a half-century, before doing any work, you must get information from a knowledgeable astrologer
 Even you should not forget to buy a vehicle in this time, otherwise that vehicle Instead of being a vehicle of happiness, it will become a vehicle of sorrows
 We have seen in our last twenty-five years experience that how many industrialists in Sadhesati were in bad condition, and those who were crorepatis, they were road Then it started moving in a pot
 In this way, it was also realized that whenever Saturn is moving in four, six, eight, twelve, then its original wealth will be destroyed, no matter how much should be done
 If the idea of this time has already been done, then money is saved
 yadi saavdhaanee nahi barti gai to maatr pachhtaawaa hi rah jaataa he
 Therefore, every person should do the chanting tenacity and the laws that we will tell before the beginning of Saturn of this time
 To avoid the wrath of Lord Ravi, Ravana tied him with his legs in his captivity and turned his head downwards
 It was kept so that the curve of Saturn would not fall on Ravana
 aaj bhi kai hindu jane anjaane ravan kii bhaanti pratikatmak taur pe shani praturup ko dukaanon yaa vaahanon main pairon se baandh kar ulta latakaate hai
 Although the mythological suggestion is to do devotion to Shree Hanuman, because Shani Dev gave a boon to Hanuman ji that Hanuman devotees would not have a curved vision of Shani
 shanidev paramakalyaan karta nyaayadhish or jeev kaa paramahitaishi grah maane jate hai
 Lord Parayana beings who perform austerities after birth, at the time of penance, become ignorant and become impure by being ignorant of Maya, that is, they are not able to complete austerity, to fulfill the austerities of those ascetics Inspires to meditate again
 dreshkan kundli me jab shani ko chandramaa dekhtaa he, yaa chandramaa shani ke dwaara dekha jaataa he, to ucch koti kaa sant bana detaa he
 And such a person is disgusted with family attachment and gives disinterest by making a great saint
 shani purv janm ke tap ko purna karne ke liye praani kii samast manovritiyon ko paramatma main lagane ke liye manushya ko ant rahit bhav dekar ucch stareey mahatma bana detaa he
 So that his penance is successful in the present birth, and he can enjoy the joy of ecstasy and get the good fortune of the Lord Darshan
 shani tap karne kii prerana detaa he
 And Saturn places his mind in the divine
 kaaran shani hi navagrahon main jataka ke gyaan chakshu kholta he
 In the Skanda Purana, there is an account in the Kashi section, that Chhaya Sutra Sri Shani Dev asked his father Lord Surya Dev that, o father! i want to get a post that no one has received till date, o Father! My mandal is seven times bigger than you, i have seven times more power than you, no one can withstand my velocity, whether it is Dev, Asura, Demon, or Siddha seeker
 May the times be elevated
 i want to get another boon, that i should have direct vision of my deity Lord Krishna, and that i can be full of devotional knowledge and science
 Hearing this God of Lord Shiva Ury pleased and overwhelmed, and said, Son! i also want this, that you are seven times more powerful than me
 i cannot bear your influence, for this you have to meditate, go to Kashi to meditate, go there and go to Lord Shankar
 Tax, shani grah kii peeda se nivaaran ke liye paath, puja, stotra, mantra or gayatri aadi ko likh rahaa hoon, jo kaafii laabhakaari siddh honge

 i was telling you why Saturn gives trouble to itself, Shani teaches us to do penance, either stop meditating on your own or Shani will force you to meditate, when there is nothing nearby, then stay hungry yourself You will learn, when millions of worries will enter your mind, you will not know the thirst of hunger on your own
 By doing this, you will get knowledge and knowledge of science

 Udanta Martand was the first newspaper in Hindi
 iskaa prakaashan 30 may, 1826 i
 main kalakatta se ek saptahik patr ke rup main shuru hua tha
 In 1826 AD, Jugalkishore Sukul organized a Hindi weekly paper called Udantmartand from Amdatalla Gali, a locality called Kolu Tola of Kolkata
 us samay angreji, farsi or bangla main to anek patr nikal rahe the kintu hindi main ek bhi patr nahin nikalataa tha
 Hence the publication of "udant Martad" was started
 iske sampadak bhi shri jugulkishor sukul hi the
 He was originally a resident of Kanpur, United States
 yah patr pustakaakaar chhapata tha or har mangalvaar ko nikalataa tha
 Only a total of 79 issues were published that after one and a half years, in December 1827, its publication had to be stopped
 iske antim ank main likhaa he-udant maartand kii yatra-miti pus badi 1 bhoum sanwat 1884 taarikh disambar san 1827
 Today is the day Ug Chukyu Martand Udanta astachal ko jaat he dinakar din ab ant
 Without government assistance in those days, it was often impossible to run any letter
 company sarkaar ne mishnariyon ke patr ko to dak aadi kii suvidha de rakhi thi, parantu cheshtaa karne par bhi "udant martand" ko yah suvidha praapt nahin ho saki
 This paper used a mixed form of both Braj and Khadiboli which the operators of this paper called "madhya Pradesh language"
 praarambhik vijyapti is prakaar thi - "yah "udant martand" ab pehle-pahal hindustaniyon ke hit ke het jo aaj tak kisi ne nahin chalaaya par angreji o parsi o bengal main jo samachar kaa kaagaj chhapata he unka sukh un boliyon ke jaanane or padhane waalon ko hi hota he

 The Uber Cup, sometimes called the Women's World Team Competition, is a major international badminton competition in which national women's badminton teams from different countries participate
 pehali baar iskaa aayojan 1956–1957 main teen varshon ke antaraal par kiya gaya tha
 Then from 1984, it started happening every two years
 iskaa kaarykram or aayojan sthal thomas cap ke saath mila diya gaya jo purush tiimon kii vaishvik pratiyogita thi
 The Uber Cup was named after Betty Uber, a former British woman player who in 1950 thought of organizing such a competition for women similar to men
 unhone 1956–1957 ke pehle pratiyogita ke liye khilaadiyon kaa chunaav bhi kiya jiskaa aayojan lankashair, england ke litham saint ans main hua tha

 Hindon River is a tributary of Yamuna River in Northern India
 iskaa puraatan naam harandi yaa harnandi bhi tha
 It originates in the upper Shivalik ranges of the lower Himalayan region in Saharanpur district
 yah purnat: varsha-ashrith nadi he or iskaa basin kshetra 7,083 varg ki me he
 It joins the Yamuna at a distance of about 400 km in length between Muzaffarnagar District, Meerut District, Baghpat District, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida between the Ganges and Yamuna rivers

 Its water has never been worth drinking, now the pollution in this river has increased so much that the existence of aquatic creatures is in danger
 aise main hindon nadi ab keval shodh karne tak hi simit rah gai he
 The amount of oxygen in it is continuously decreasing
 varsha ritu main bhi yah lagbhag jalaviheen rahati he
 The amount of dissolved oxygen in the river has been reduced to two to three milligrams per liter due to continuous industrial waste and worship material etc
 shodhakarta dow prasum tyaagi ke anusaar praayah oxigen kaa str 60 lakh milligram prati litre yaa zyada hona chahie
 This is the reason that only kironos larvae are left in the name of aquatic life near Mohan Nagar and Chharasi in the river, which is a sign of heavy water pollution
 yah sookshm jeev kii shrenee main aata he
 Distillery waste, waste discharge, religious worship material and excreta are found from Mohan Nagar Industrial Area in Hindon River

 Collective security refers to a regional or global security system in which each constituent state recognizes that the security of a single state is a matter of concern for all
 yah maitri suraksha kii pranali se adhik mahatvakankshi pranali he
 Collective security has been considered as an effective means of expanding power and preventing wars in the world
 iske antargat suraksha kaa lakshya praapt karne hetu rashtron dwaara samuhik prayaas karne kii baat kahi gai he
 Although this principle was adopted under the United Nations and United Nations Organizations established after the end of World War i and World War II, its presence is found in many 17th century scholarly texts
 1648 kii westephelia kii sandhi main bhi yah ullekh tha ki is sandhi par hastakshar karne vaale rajyon ko yah adhikaar he ki kisi ke bhi viruddh kadam uthaane va kaarywahi karne kaa adhikaar he jisase shaanti kii raksha kii ja sake
 Later, in the Treaty of Oszebrook, it was said to take collective action against potential enemies
 19veen shatabdi main kai lekhakon ne bhi iskaa samarthan kiya, parantu isko vyaavhaarik rup 20veen shatabdi main rashtrasang evam sanyukt raashtra ke antargat hi praapt hua
 In general, the precise definition means "one for all and one for all
" “ is prakaar se kisi raashtra kii shaanti va suraksha hetu sabhi samuhik kaarywahi karne ko tatpar rahenge
 But before such action, it is necessary to state that there are some basic beliefs of this concept, which are as follows: is prakaar uparokt manyataon ke aadhaar par samuhik suraksha vyavastha shakti prabandhan ko sucharu rup se chalaa sakati he
 In principle, the following characteristics of this system are clearly revealed - sarvapratham raashtra sangh ke sanvida ke anuchhed 10-16 tak iskaa varnan sammilit kiya gaya tha
 It is described in these streams as follows- parantu upyukt praavdhaanon ke hote hue bhi raashtra sangh ne unka kabhi upyog nahin kiya
 The elements responsible for the failure of the League of Nations also influenced the collective security system
 isamen mukhya rup se america dwaara rashtrasang kaa sadsy na bananaa, vijit va haare rashtron ke bich pratidwandita jari rahanaa, germany va france ke matbhed vahiin par rahanaa, soviet sangh kaa is sanghathan se baahar rahanaa, parishad kii sadsyta badalte rahanaa, japan, germany va italy dwaara isaki khuli avmaananaa karnaa aadi bahut se aise kaaran hai jisaki vajah se praarambhik kuch varshon ko chhod den to raashtra sangh vifal rahaa
 It was natural, therefore, that the failure of collective security was also inevitable
 atah samuhik suraksha ke vikaas va ise lagu karne ke sandarbh main rashtrasang purna rup se duvidhagrast tha tathaa prarambh se hi shaktiheen rahaa
 Taking lessons from the experiences of the United Nations, its United Nations Charter was a very clear article
 yadhyapi sampoorn charter main ”samuhik suraksha“ shabd kaa prayog nahin kiya gaya he, parantu adhyay saat main ‘sanyukt kaarywahi’ hi samuhik suraksha kaa swaroop he
 In principle, it is mentioned in the charter under four arrangements - sanyukt raashtra charter ke bhaag 1 main iske uddeshyon kaa varnan karte hue anuchhed 1 main kaha gaya he ki antarrashtriya shanti va suraksha hetu sanyukt raashtra / samuhik kaarywahi karegi
 These organizations can take collective action with the permission of the United Nations for regional peace and security
 1950 main korea ke sankat ke samay mahasabha dwaara shanti ke liye ekta prastaav ke madhyam se yah vyavastha kii gai he ki yadi antarrashtriya shanti va suraksha ke khatre kii ashanka par suraksha parishad koi kaarywahi nahin karata he to mahasabha suraksha parishad ko kaarywahi hetu kah saktaa he
 Therefore, it is clear from the above three circumstances that collective security has been arranged in the objectives and practice of the United Nations Charter
 vaastavik rup main adhyay 7 main dandatmak kaarywahi ke rup main isaki vyakhya kii gai he
 Before taking action, Article 41 insists on taking non-military steps so that the invading state does not become a threat to world peace
 iske baad anuchheda 42 main gheraabandi kii vyavastha kii gai he
 Finally, there is a provision for military action in which all nations have an obligation to cooperate in the army
 iske baad ek sainya staff samiti ke gathan kii baat kii gai he jo ek commander ke adheen sanyukt raashtra ke jhande ke neeche kaarywahi karenge 
 Thus, after the failure of all other actions, the war action is approved
 iske atirikt yah bhi spasht kiya gaya he ki is kaarywahi kaa aguva sanyukt raashtra kaa commander hoga, kisi ek desh yaa anya sanghathan kaa nahin
 It is mandatory, if not mandatory, for most countries to participate in this action
 samuhik suraksha kii kaarywahi sanyukt raashtra ke adheen shakti ko rokane yaa seemaabaddh karne main sakasham he yaa nahin yah iske saiddhanthik evam vyavhaarik pahaluon ke moolyankan ke baad hi kaha ja saktaa he
 Theoretically, many questions have been raised regarding its success
 kya sabhi raashtra akramanakari ko pahachaanate hai? kya akraman ko rokane hetu sabhi purna rup se icchhuk hai? kya samuhik samooh akramanakari se adhik shaktishaalee hai? kya vishwa shanti shakti vistaar se sambhav he? kya sabhi desh rashtrahiton ko bhulaakar ekajute ho sakenge? aadi
 In theory as well as in practical terms, in the Cold War and post-cold War periods, collective security has been disregarded in its own way
 shityudh kaal main yuddh va shaati kaa prashn vichaardhaara ke aadhaar par tay kiya jaataa tha
 Likewise support on UN decisions
 isiilie shaayad is yug main hui korea ke viruddh samuhik suraksha kii kaarywahi purnataya safal nahin ho saki
 Rather, this action was possible only in a special situation when it was ruled that non-attendance from UN action cannot be considered a veto
 shityudhottar yug main iraq ke viruddh hui kaarywahi ko bhi vastunishth evam sanyukt raashtra kii sangya dena galat hoga
 This action can also be called a joint operation of mainly US and NATO countries or later US and UK
 is kaarywahi ke dauraan na to sanyukt raashtra charter kii dhaaraon kaa paalan kiya tathaa na hi yuddh taalane kii koshishen kii gai
 Rather it seemed that this war was fought to fulfill some of its obscure interests
 iske atirikt, ab yuddh main hue baari maatra main vidhwans ke baad america dwaara yah swikaarna ki hathiyaaron ke sandarbh main use galat rup se suchit kiya is saare ghatnakram ko haasyaaspad bana detaa he
 But will the loss of Iraq be replenished by saying so
 parantu vaastaviktaa yah he ki shityudhottar yug main america ke ekmaatra shakti rahane ke kaaran uski kisi bhi kaarywahi ko roak paanaa asambhav he
 Therefore, all attacks by the US will be considered justified
 is prakaar nishkarsh rup main kah sakate hai ki siddhanth va vyavhaar donon kii paristhitiyon main ab samuhik suraksha ke aadhaar par shakti par ankush lagaana kathin he
 Whatever the reason may be, this was true even in the Cold War era and today it is true even in the post Cold War era
 iske saath-saath parmaanu, jaivik evam rasinic hathiyaaron ke sandarbh main yudhon ko rokna bhi kathin hota ja rahaa he
 Therefore, putting limits on power was not very effective for this principle
