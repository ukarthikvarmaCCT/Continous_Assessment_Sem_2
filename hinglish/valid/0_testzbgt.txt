 Tolstoy wrote 'yuddh or shaanti' kaa lekhan tolastoy ne 1863 i0 se 1869 i0 ke bich kiya
 Its publication began in 1865
 chaar khandon main prakashit is upanyaas kii prishth sankhya lagbhag dedh hajaar thi
 This large novel was conceived in about 15 different forms
 anek adhyay kai-kai baar badale gayi or naye sire se likhe gayi

 This was Tolstoy's more comprehensive view of history
 unhone yah spasht karnaa chaha he ki yuddh kaa saare samaaj, jivan ke sabhi pakshon, sabhi virgon or shreniyon ke logon par kya prabhaav padataa he
 For this reason, some of Tolstoy's scholars believe that Tolstoy in the original Russian word synonymous with peace, not Tolastoy, means peace, but the people or the whole society

 But, as the new approach in astronomy used to say: "true we do not feel the motion of the earth, but by assuming its stability we reach unrestrained, while by assuming motion, which we do not feel, we find the rule" , - Similarly, in history, the new perspective says: "it is true that we do not feel our subordination, but by assuming our independence we reach unrestrained, whereas the outer world, time and We find rules by assuming our dependence on Ranas
 " In the first case, the problem was to deny the existence of non-existent stability and to accept the motion which we do not realize; And in this case - in the same way there is a need to deny the non-existent freedom and accept the subordination which we do not feel

 atthaisvin putali kaa naam vaidehi tha or usne apni katha is prakaar kahi- ek baar raja vikramaditya apane shayan kaksh main gahari nidra main leen the
 He had a dream
 ek swarna mahal he jisamen ratna, maanik ityadi jade hai
 The palace has large rooms with supernatural decoration
 mahal ke chaaron ore udyaan hai or udyaan main hazaron tarah ke sundar-sundar phulon se laden paudhe hai
 There are different types of butterflies hovering over those flowers and the buzzing of whirlpools is spread throughout the garden
 phulon kii sugandh chaaron ore faili hui he or sara drishy bada hi manoram he
 Clean and cool air is blowing and there is a yogi instrument at some distance from the palace
 yogi kaa cheharaa gaur se dekhne par vikram ko vah apana hamashiithal maaloom padaa
 On seeing all this, Vikram's eyes opened
 ve samaj gaye ki unhone koi acha sapana dekha he
 Even after waking up, he clearly remembered everything seen in the dream
 unhen apane sapane kaa matlab samaj main nahin aayaa
 The whole scene was supernatural, but could not be considered a product of the mind
 raja ne bahut sochaa par unhen yaad nahin aayaa ki kabhi apane jivan main unhone aisa koi mahal dekha ho chaahe is tarah ke kisi mahal kii kalpana kii ho
 He discussed his dream with the pandits and astrologers and asked them to explain it
 saare vidwaan or pandit is nattejey par pahunche ki maharajaadhiraj ne sapane main swarg kaa darshan kiya he tathaa sapane kaa alokik mahal swarg ke raja indra kaa mahal he
 The deity may have shown him the palace and invited him to come to heaven
 vikram yah sunakar bade aashcharya main pad gaye
 He never thought that he would get such an invitation to come to heaven
 ve panditon se poochne lage ki swarg jane kaa koun sa maarg hoga tathaa swarg yatra ke liye kya-kya aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 After much brainstorming, all the scholars told him the direction from which self-ascension could take place and told them that any saint who remembers the eternal God and does not deviate from the path of religion is entitled to go to heaven
 raja ne kaha ki rajpaat chalaane ke liye jaanboojhkar nahi to bhul se hi avashya koi dharm viruddh aacharan unase hua hoga
 Apart from this, sometimes they are so entangled in the problem of the state that they do not remember God
 is par sabhi ne ek swar se kaha ki yadi ve is yogya nahin hote to unhen swarg kaa darshan hi nahin hua hota
 On the advice of everyone, he took Rajpurohit with him and set out on a journey to heaven
 panditon ke kathan ke anusaar unhen yatra ke dauraan do punyakarm bhi karne the
 This journey was long and difficult
 vikram ne apana rajasi bhesh tyaag diya tha or atyant saadhaaran kapadon main yatra kar rahe the
 On the way, i stopped for a night's rest in a city
 jahaan ruke the vahaan unhen ek boodhi aurat roti hui mili
 The lines of worry were bulging on his forehead and the throat was weeping
 vikram ne dravit hokar usase uski chintaa kaa kaaran poocha to usne bataaya ki uskaa ekmaatr jawan betaa subah hi jangal gaya, lekin abhi tak nahin lautaa he
 Vikram wanted to know for what purpose he went to the forest
 budhi aurat ne bataaya ki uskaa betaa rose subah main jangal se sukhi lakadiyaan laane jaataa he or lakadiyaan laakar nagar main bechata he
 The dice they get by selling wood are passed by them
 vikram ne kaha ki ab tak vah nahin aayaa he to aa jayega
 The old woman said that the forest is very dense and full of cannibal animals
 use shankaa he ki kahin kisi hinsak jaanavar ne use apana grass na bana liya ho
 She also told that since the evening she had pleaded with many people to find her son, but no one agreed to go to the forest
 usne apni vivashtaa dikhaai ki vah budhi or nirbal he, isliye khud jaakar pataa nahin kar sakati he
 Vikram assured her that they would go and find him
 unhone vishram kaa vichaar tyaag diya or turant jangal kii ore chal pade
 After a while he entered the forest and saw that the forest was really very dense
 ve chaukanne hokar thodi dur aae to unhone dekha ki ek noujvaan kulhadi lekar ped par dubakaa baitha he or neeche ek sher ghaat lagaae baitha he
 Vikram, after finding a solution, drove the lion away from there and returned to the city with the young man
 budhiya ne bete ko dekhakar vilaap karnaa chhod diya or vikram ko dheron aashirwad die
 In this way, by worrying Budiya, he did a virtuous work
 raat bhar vishram karne ke baad unhone subah phir se apni yatra shuru kar di
 As they walked to the beach, they saw a woman crying
 sree ko rote dekh ve uske paas aae to dekha ki ek malwahak jahaaj khadaa he or kuch log us jahaaj par saamaan lad rahe hai
 When they asked the woman the reason for her crying, she told that she got married just three months ago and she is pregnant
 uskaa pati isi jahaaj par karmchaaree he tathaa jahaaj kaa maal lekar dur desh ja rahaa he
 When Vikram told her that there was no problem in this and that her husband would return shortly after, she told the reason for his concern
 usne bataaya ki usne kal sapane main dekha ki ek malwahak jahaaj samudr ke bich main hi or bhayanak tufaan main ghir jaataa he
 The storm is so strong that the ship crumbles and all the riders are drowned in the sea
 vah soch rahi he ki agar vah sapana sach niklaa to uskaa kya hoga
 She will also take some kind of life herself, but how will her upcoming child be raised
 vikram ko us par taras aayaa or unhone samudr devtaa dwaara pradutt shankh use dete hue kaha- "yah apane pati ko de do
 Whenever a storm or any other natural calamity comes, it will blow
 uske phunk maarthe hi sari vipatti hal jaaegi
 " aurat ko un par vishwaas nahin hua or vah shankaalu drushti se unhen dekhne lagi
 Vikram read his facial expressions and blew the conch
 shankh kii dhwani hui or samudr kaa pani koson dur chalaa gaya
 With that water, the ship and all its crew also went away
 ab dur-dur tak sirf samudr tat failaa na aata tha
 She and some other people who were there were surprised
 unki ankhen fatty rah gai
 When Vikram blew the conch again, the water of the sea again started moving there
 samudr ke pani ke saath vah jahaaj bhi karmchaariyon sahit waapas aa gaya
 Now the woman had no doubt about the miraculous power of that conch
 usne vikram se vah shankh lekar apni kritagyata jaahir kii
 Vikram gave a conch to the lady and set out on his journey
 kuch dur chalane ke baad unhen ek sthaan par ruknaa padaa
 The dark clouds had taken over the sky
 bijliyaan chamakane lagi thim
 The whole atmosphere seemed to be shaken by the thunder
 un bijaliyon ke chamak ke bich vikram ko ek safed ghoda zamin kii ore utarataa dikh
 Vikram looked at him carefully and then there was the voice of Akashvani "maharaja vikramaditya tumhaare jaisaa puneatma shaayad hi koi ho
 You did two good deeds on the way
 ek budhi aurat ko chintamukt kiya or ek sree ko sirf shankaa dur karne ke liye vah anmol shankh de diya jo samudr dev ne tumhen tumhaari sadhana se prasann hokar uphaar diya tha
 a horse is being sent to pick you up, which will take you to Indra's palace
 " Vikram said- "I am not alone
 mere saath raajpurohit bhi hai
 There should be some arrangement for them also
 " So much was to be heard that Rajpurohit said- "rajan, forgive me
 sasharir swarg jane se main darataa hoon
 If you are happy, i will go to heaven on death and consider myself blessed
 " When the horse landed near them, they were equipped with everything for the ride
 raajpurohit se vidaa lekar vikram us par baith gaye
 At the same time, the horse ran fast and reached the dense forest
 jangal main pahunchakar usne dharti chhod di or hawa main daudane laga
 This horse riding was unnatural, so quite difficult, but Vikram remained firmly seated on it
 hawa main kuch der udne ke baad vah ghoda akaash main daudane laga
 While running, he came to Indrapuri
 indrapuri pahonchte hi vikram ko vahi sapanom vaala sone kaa mahal dikh padaa
 Everything was exactly what he had dreamed
 chalate-chalate ve indrasabha pahunche
 All the gods were sitting in Indra Sabha
 apsaraayen nrity kar rahi thim
 Indra Dev was seated on his throne with his wife
 devataaon kii sabha main vikram ko dekhakar khalabali much gai
 They were all surprised to see a human coming to heaven
 vikram ko dekhakar indra khud unki agavaani karne aa gaye or unhen apane asana par baithne ko kaha
 Vikram refuses saying that he is not worthy of this posture
 indra unki namrata or saralata se prasann ho gaye
 He said that Vikram must have seen a yogi in this palace in his dream
 unka vah hamshakl or koi nahin balki ve khud hai
 He has earned so much merit that he has got a permanent place in the palace of Indra

 The term Shakti is used to denote man-controlled energy that is attainable for mechanical work
 shakti ke mukhya strot hai : manushyon evam jaanwaron kii peshiy urja, nadi evam vaayu kii gatij urja, ucch satahon par sthit jalashay kii sthitij urja, laharon evam jowarbhata kii urja, prithvi evam surya kii ooshmaa urja, eendhan ko jalaane se praapt ooshmaa urja aadi
 The use of the power of pets was the first step in human civilization
 baad main kramash: vibhinn prakaar kii shaktiyon ko upyog main laane ke liye prayaas kiye jate rahe
 Scientists are still busy in controlling more and more powers and efforts are on
 upar likhe gaye shaktisroton main vaayu, lahar, evam surya dwaara praapt shaktiyaan aantrayik hoti hai or yahi in sab kaa sabase bada avagun he, kyonki shakti kii maang yadi santat ho, to is prakaar kii shaktiyon ko upyog main laane ke liye inke sangrah kii vyavastha kerani hogi
 Considering the size and price of the power plant, the use of the power received by wind, wave and sun is not beneficial in the state of power generation on a large scale
 kuch sthanon main bade paimaane par shaktijnan ke liye jowarbhata kii shakti kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he, kintu is prakaar ke sanyantr ke nirmaan main vyay atyadhik hota he
 The term "power" is used by scientists to rate energetics

 In order to use natural sources of energy, the related equipment can be divided into three classes by installation: praaia: mul chaalak un sthanon main, jahaan urja ke prakritik strot prachur maatra main prapya hon, sthapit kiya jaataa he, jaise jalprapaat ke nikat yaa koyale kii khaanon ke kshetra main
 a water power or a natural power plant near a source of natural water, such as a river, lake, etc
, where water energy is converted into mechanical energy by a water turbine, is established
 damodar ghati yojana ke antargat is prakaar ke sanyantr kii sthapana, bihar rajya ke dhanavaad jile main mithan evam panchet or hazaribagh jila main tilaiya naamak sthanon par kii gai he
 These types of plants have been installed at various places in India, such as Bhakra Nangal, Hirakud, Tungabhadra, Rihand etc
 koyale kii khanvaale kshetron main koyale dwaara praapt ooshmaa urja ko, ooshmiya shaktisanyantr main bhaap tarabine, yaa bhaap ingine dwaara yantric urja main parivartit kiya jaataa he
 For this, steam is prepared in a steam burner by burning coal and this steam is used to drive the basic conductor, such as a steam turbine or steam engine
 is tarah ke ooshmiya shaktisanyantr bokaro evam durgapur main hai
 The energy received by the above types of hydraulic and thermal power plants is transmitted in huge quantities in factories located at very far distance
 is tarah ke shaktisancharan kii avasthaa main shaktivitaran ke tareeke evam upkaran adhik mahatvapurn hai, kyonki mul chaalak se un sthanon kii duuri, jahaan yantron dwaara urja kaa upyog hota he, vitaran kii dakshata par nirbhar karti he
 In some factories, the energy received by the original driver is transmitted to nearby devices
 is avasthaa main tel dwaara chaalit mul chaalak, jaise tel ingine, kaa prayog adhik hota he
 In this the transmission plant is more important, because the efficiency of transmission affects the efficiency of the whole plant
 kabhi-kabhi mul chaalak ko yantra se is tarah jod diya jaataa he ki sancharan upkaran sugamawapurvak mul chaalak, yaa yantra se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Rail locomotives etc
 fall into this category
 shaktisancharan ke vibhinn vidhiyaan hai : There is continuous research on the electrical device of power transmission
 satat parivarti vaidyut danti kaa avishkaar bahut pehle ho chukaa he
 Tips for achieving the loss of force by intercepting the barrier cannot be said to be virtually variable transmissions
 shaktipreshan kii vaidyut yuktiyon kaa upyog vaidyut railgadiyon main adhik hota he
 Power is generated by behaving as a motor for the internal engine dynamo, and a specially designed tooth is driven with the help of an electric motor to rotate the cycles
 shakti kaa yantric sancharan patte yaa rajju kii sahaayta se shift dwaara, athwa yantrichakr or zanjeer kii sahaayta se hota he
 These methods are used differently, or with each other, to transmit power according to the situation
 mul chaalak ke anusaar shaktisancharan ke yantric upkarnon kaa abhikalp evam nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 The power is transmitted to the line shaft by the strap on the driving wheel of the original driver
 rekha shift par abhikalp ke anusaar ghiraniyaan lagi rahati hai
 The power is transmitted from the lineshaft to various devices by a strap attached to those pulleys
 is prakaar kii pranali main sabase bada avagun yah he ki kisi bhi karanvash rekhashaft kaa chalanaa band hote hi sabhi yantra, jinhen rekhashaft se shakti sancharit kii jaati he, bekaar ho jate hai
 For quantitative analysis of this type of power transmission, the crank shaft of the engine is taken as the starting point of transmission and the first moving shaft of the device as the end point of transmission
 yah anumaan vishisht yatra ke liye upyukt he
 Let the engine speed is n revolutions per minute
 is gati par chalate hue ingine crankashaft par lagaataar bal adhurna daalata rahata he
 Assuming that the quantity of force base is t kg per meter
 is avasthaa main ingine kii koniya gati w, kaa mulya hoga 2 x pai x n / 60
 Here the unit of w is radians per second
 at: ingine crank shift dwaara kiye gaye kaary kii dar wt kilogram prati meter prati second he
 Assuming for convenience, the entire power received from the crank shaft is transmitted to a single device
 maan liya, us yantra par daalaa janevaala bal aghurna T1 kilogram prati meter he or w1 radian prati second yantra kii koniya gati he, tab us yantra dwaara praapt urja kii dar hogi w1t1 kilogram meter prati second
 Some part of the energy is absorbed by the transmission to overwhelm friction and other obstructions
 yadi aisa nahin ho, to yantra dwaara urja avasorana kii dar mul chaalak dwaara utpann urja kii dar ke samatuly hogi
 But in practice this does not happen
 haavda express 3072 bhartiya rail dwaara sanchalit ek mail express train he
 This train leaves from Jamalpur Junction railway station at 05:55 PM and arrives at Howrah Junction railway station at 04:40 AM

 From the biological point of view, a group of such organisms is called a caste which has the potential to produce offspring with each other and whose offspring themselves have the capacity to produce offspring further
 udhaaharan ke liye ek bhediya or sher aapas main baccha paidaa nahin kar sakate isliye ve alag jatiyon ke maane jate hai
 a horse and a donkey can produce a child among themselves, but because mules are unable to bear a child, horses and donkeys are also considered to be of different castes

 In most textbooks a race is a "real and potentially inter-breed natural population group" that is set apart as other such breeding groups
 is paribhaasha ke vibhinn bhaagon jaise kuch asaamaanya yaa kritrim samagam isse baahar rakhe gaye hai: The definition in the above ideal textbook works well for multi-cellular animals, but there are some situations where they can be ruled out as inappropriate: kshaitijiya jin sthanantaran shabd "jati" paribhaashit karne ko or bhi jatil bana dete hai
 There is strong evidence of horizontal gene transfer between unequal groups of the prokerat group and, at least often, unequal groups of eukaryates, and Williamson argues that there is some evidence available of this in crustaceans and echinoderms

 One of the best questions is the term "caste" which is being described by zoologists and this discussion is known as the problem of castes
 darwin ne on da orijan of spasis ke adhyay II main likhaa
 But later, Darwin amended his view in The Descent of Man by saying "whether humans consist of one or many castes"
 vikaas kaa aadhunik siddhant "jati" kii nai moolbhoot paribhaashaon par nirbhar he
 Prior to Darwin, naturalists viewed castes as ideal or common types, which can be exemplified with an ideal model that has all the same qualities as a normal race
 darwin ke siddhant kii ekarupata ne dhyaan ko saadhaaran se vishesh kii taraf sthanantarit kar diya
 According to intellectual historian Lewis Meinand, yah "jati" ko nae drushtikon main badal detaa he; darwin In practice, biologists have defined castes as populations of animals that have high levels of genetic similarity
 yah usee jeevakosh ke anukulan ko pratibimbit or anuvaanshik saamagree kaa ek se duusare main sambhavit sadhano kii kismon ko sthanantarit kar sakati he
 The exact level of similarity in this type of definition is used unilaterally, but it is the most common definition used for animals that cause asexual reproduction, such as some plants and micro-organisms
 sookshm jeev vigyaan main kisi bhi spasht jati kii kami kii badhya ne kuch lekhakon ko tark dene ke liye badhya kar diya he ki jeevanu kaa adhyayan karte samay "jati" shabd kaa upyog sahi nahin he
 Instead, they observed genes far-flung related bacteria, bacteria associated with the entire bacterial region, with a gene pool independently
 phir bhi, anguuthe ke niyam kii sthapana yah kehete hue kii gai ki ve ek duusare se 97% se adhik samaan 16S rrna jin kram bacteria yaa orchia kii jaanch DNA-DNA sankaran dwaara kii jaani chahie chahen vah samaan jati se sambandhit hon athwa nahin
 The concept has recently been updated, stating that the 97% threshold was too low and could be increased to 98
7%
 yon rup se paidaa hone vaale jeevon, jahaan par jin sambandhi saamagree ko prajnan sambandhi prakriya main saajha kiya jaataa he, to do praaniyon ke antar janan prakriya or donon lingon ke sankar vansh samaan sanketak ke rup main sweekaar kiye jate hai ki praaniyon ne samaan jati ke sadsy ke rup main prachur jeenon ko apanaaya he
 In a way "caste" is a group of inter-breeding beings
 is paribhaasha ko yah kehete hue aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he ki jati praaniyon kaa vah samooh he jo sambhavit taur se antarjaatiy prajnan karne main sakasham he - machhliyon ko usee jati main rakhaa ja saktaa he bhale hi ve bhinn-bhinn jhiilon main rahati hon kyonki ve antarjaatiy prajnan kar sakati hai yadi ve kabhi bhi ek duusare ke sampark main aayin hon
 duusari ore, teen yaa adhik vicitra aabaadi vaale bahut se udhaaharan hai ki kya bich main aabaadi vaale jantu duusare prakaar kii aabaadi vaale jantuon main antar prajnan kar sakate hai lekin duusari taraf aabaadi vaale ye jantu antar prajnan karne main sakasham nahin hai
 Thus, it is debatable whether these populations constitute one or two different castes
 isamen koi virodhabhas nahin he ki jatiyon ko jin aavritiyon ke aadhaar par paribhaashit kii jaati hai or is prakaar se unki aspasht simaaen hai
 Consequently, the universal definition of "caste" is necessarily unilateral
 iske bajaay, jeev vigyaniyon ne bahut si paribhaashaayen di hai; jiskaa upyog koi jeev vigyaani ke liye paripurna vikalp he, vah us jeev vigyaani ke shodh kii visheshtaon par nirbhar karata he
 In practice, these definitions are similar and their case is more important than the outright contradiction between them
 phir bhi, abhi tak prastaavit jati kii koi bhi avadharana puri tarah se uddeshypurna nahin he yaa kisi nirnay ke liye sahaayta liye bina sabhi maamalon main lagu ho saktaa he
 Given the complexity of life, some say that the definition of such an objective is impossible in all kinds of possibilities and that biologists must determine the most plausible definition
 adhikansh ridh vihin praaniyon main yah sabhi jaivik jatiyon kii avadharana he or filogenetic jati kii avdhaaran main kaaphi had tak kam he
 Many BSC sub-castes are considered castes under the PSC; The difference between BSC and PSC can be determined because the BSC defines race as a result of a clear evolutionary history, whereas PSC defines a race as a result of a clear evolutionary possibility
 is prakaar se, PSC jatiyon ko "banaaya" gaya jaise hi vikasvaadi vansh ko alag kiya janaa shuru hua, jabaki BSC jati ne keval tabhi nikalnaa shuru kiya jab unka vansh kaa algaav purna ho gaya
 Accordingly, substantial controversy between alternative classifications based on PSC vs
 BSC is possible because they are totally different depending on the behavior of their taxa, which would be considered sub-casts under the latter model
 jivan ke samarthan vaali jatiyaan: kai jatiyaan paryaavaran ke anukulan ke prati bilkul vicitra hoti hai, kyonki ve kuch sthitiyon ke antargat paidaavaar yaa prajnan karne main sakasham hai jaise sookhaa, banjar, baadh, mitti kii vishaaktata, mitti kii lavanta jinamein se bahut se bhojan, samagriyaan pradaan karte hai or maanav ko shakti pradaan karne vaale pashudhan or anya jaanwaron manushya ke liye sambhavit rup se laabhakaari maane jate hai or ye jivan sahaayak jatiyon ke rup main jaani jaati hai
 As such they consist of mutual main castes because they have the main key to the integrity of the landforms that comprise the bio-data and human communities of both creatures
 donon paristhitiki or saamaajik aarthik jatiyaan jivan ke liye sahaayak jatiyaan hai
 Considering the problems mentioned earlier with the classification of castes, the following numbers are merely nominal guidance
 2007 main, ve nimnanusaar the: Total number of castes: 7-100 million including: eukrayete jatiyon main se hamane keval inaki pahchaan hi kar sake: Currently, the Global Texonomy Initiative, the European Distributed Institute of Texonomy and the Census of Marine Life are attempting to reform the taxonomy and implement the taxonomy system from previously unknown nations
 is satya ke kaaran ki ham jeev mandal main keval kuch praaniyon ko hi jaanate hai, phir bhi hamen apane paryaavaran ke kaamkaaj kii puri samaj nahin he
 According to Professor James Mellet, despite the discovery of new castes, we are making matters worse and we are ending these castes with unprecedented speed
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki kisi nai jati ko praapt karne se pehle iskaa adhyayan or vargeekaran kiya janaa chahie, chunki ho saktaa he ki vah pehle se hi vilupt ho chuki ho
 The notion of castes has a long history
 kai kaarnon se yah vargeekaran ke sabase mahatvapurn staron main se ek he: After years of experimentation, the concept of biology has been prominent as a host of related fields but has not yet been fully defined
 kisi vishesh jati ke namakaran ke jeevon ko us samooh ke jeevon ke vikasvaadi sambandh or or unki vividhta ke bare main pariklpana maani jaani chahie
 The hypothesis can be confirmed or refuted as advance information comes in hand

 When a two-name caste was discovered as a single caste, the old caste name was usually retained and the new caste name was given that name, a process that is synonymous with aggregation or a colloquial process
 It is called
 texon ko ek se adhik main vibhajit karne main aamtaur se nayaa vaala vibhaajan texons kehalaata he
 Taxonomy Scientists are usually called "lumpers" or "splitters" by their classmates, depending on their individual attitudes and similarities to the differences identified between animals
 paramparaagat rup se, shodhakarta sanrachanaatmak antaron ke avlokan or is avlokan par ki kya bhinn aabaadi main jatiyon main atar ke liye unka antar prajnan safaltaapurvak kiya gaya athwa nahin, par bharosa karte hai; donon sharir rachana or prajnan vyavhaar donon hi abhi bhi jatiyon kii sthiti bataane ke liye mahatvapurn hai
 In the last few decades, as a result of the revolution in microbiological research techniques, DNA analysis has provided unfathomable knowledge about differences and similarities between castes
 kai aabaadiyaan jo pehle pruthak jatiyon ke rup main maani jaati thim ko ab ek texonmana jaataa he or purv samoohikrut aabaadi ko vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Any classification level can be synonymous or subdivided, and at higher taxonomic levels these modifications are still very unfathomable
 vargeekaran ke drushtikon se, jati main samoohon ko jati kii tulana main texon vargeekaran ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Only sub-castes are used in zoology whereas diversity, sub-diversity and form have been used in botany
 sangrakshan jeev vigyaan main, vikasvaadi mahatvapurn ikai kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jise jati yaa adhik choti vicitra aabaadi vaale khand ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 In the early work of science, castes were simply individual beings representing their own or nearly identical group of beings
 us samay un par inke alaava koi anya sambandh lagu nahin hote the
 Aristotle used the term genus and caste to refer to caste or special classes
 arestu or anya purv-darvinian vaigyanikon ne jatiyon ko "saar" jaise rasinic tatwon ke rup main vishesh or aparivartaneey mana
 jab aarambhik prekshkon ne jeevon ke liye sanghathan ko pranali ke rup main viksit karnaa chaalu kiya, to unhone pehle se pruthak ko is sthaan par rakhana aarambh kar diya
 Many of these early illustration schemes will no longer be considered eccentric and include colors or behaviors based on coherence
 18 veen sadi main swedish vaigyanik carolas linius ne prajnan angon ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya
 Although their type of classification of organisms classified organisms according to similarity, they did not make any claims about the relationship between similar castes
 
 us samay, vyapak rup se abhi bhi yah vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki jatiyon ke madhya koi bhi mana he ki vahaan jaivik jatiyon ke bich koi bhi jaivik sambandh nahin tha, bhale hi ve kitne hi samaan dikhaai kyon na dete hon
 is drushtikon ne bhi ek prakaar ke adarshavaad kaa suzav diya: yah dharna ki maujuuda sabhi jatiyaan ek "adarsh swaroop" he
 Although there are always differences between all the organisms over there, Linnaeus considered such differences problematic
 He attempted to identify individual organisms which were exemplary of castes and considered other non-exemplary organisms to be unusual and incomplete
 19 veen sadi tak adhikansh prakrutivaadee samaj gaye the ki jati samay samay par badal sakati hai or yah ki grih ke itihaas ne unamem mukhya parivartanon ke liye paryaapt samay diya tha
 jean-baptiste Lamarck gave the first logical idea against creation-theory in Zoological Philosophy
 jatiyaan samay ke saath-saath kaise badal sakati he ke nirdhaaran ke bare main nai praathamikta thi
 Lamarck suggested that the organism could pass on an inherited trait to its incoming lineage, such as reaching the leaves of a giraffe's long neck-high trees was a trait of the giraffe's generation
 haalanki, 1860 main charles darwin kii prakritik chayan vichaar kii sweekruti ke saath, lenmark ke lakshya-unmukh vikaas ke drushtikon jise teleological prakriya ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he ko prabhaavaheen kar diya gaya tha
 Recent interest in inheritance of features acquired around methylation processes such as methylation that does not affect DNA sequence, but expression may be altered in an inherited manner
 is prakaar, nio-lamarkwaad, jiseki kabhi-kabhi iske bare main baat bhi hui hai ki prakritik chayan ke saath vikaas kaa siddhant koi chunauti nahin he
 Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace gave the idea which is still followed by the theory of scientific development in the most powerful and compelling form
 darwin ne tark diya ki yah shaamil aabaadi hi thi koi praani maatr nahin
 His argument is more credible than the perspective of Linnaeus's radical stream: Instead of interpreting race as an ideal term, Darwin considered the difference between organisms to be natural
 He further argues that his explanation for the existence of a rare caste, far from problematic, was in fact
 darwin ke kaam ne thomas malthske antardrushti ko apni taraf aakarshith kiya ki jaivik jansankhya kii vruddhi dar paryaavaran main sansadhano kii vruddhi dar se hameshaa aage rahegi jiseki bhojan kii aapurti
 iske parinamswaroop, darwin ne tark diya ki aabaadi ke sabhi jeev nirvaah or prajnan karne main sakasham nahin honge
 The work done by them will be average, but there will be a difference - although they will make it a little more environmentally friendly
 If the difference of these qualities is ancestral, then the descendants of the survivors will take them
 is prakaar, kai pidiyon se anukuli vividhtaayen aabaadi main jamaa ho jaaengi, jabaki pratikul gun samaapt ho jaaenge
 It should be emphasized whether a difference in the environment is adaptive or non-adaptive: different environments favor different qualities
 kyonki paryaavaran hi kargar dhang se is baat kaa chayan karata he ki kis praani ko prajnan ke liye jivit rahanaa he or vah paryaavaran hi he jo is baat kaa nirdhaaran karte he ki kaunse gun aage jane chahie
 It is the principle of evolution by natural selection
 is model main, ek jiraph kii gardan kii lambaai kii vyakhya sthiti ke anusaar kii jaaegi ki lambii gardan vaale proto-jiraph ne vishesh prajnankaree visheshaataaon ko choti gardan vaale jiraph se praapt kiya kai pidiyon se, puri aabaadi lambii gardan vaale pashuon kii jati kii hogi
 In 1859, when Darwin published his theory of natural selection, there was no knowledge of mechanisms with individual properties of inheritance at that time
 haalanki darwin ne gun ke vanshanukram se praapt hone ke bare main kuch kalpanaaen kii, lekin usnaa siddhant keval is sachai par aadhaarit tha ki vanshanukram gun maujuud hote hai or ve parivartanashin hote hai
 However, the paper on Gregor Mandel's genetics was published in 1866 without identifying its characteristics
 is par 1900 tak koi kaary nahin kiya gaya jab unke kaary kii pun: khoj hugo di verise, karl corence or erik won semark dwaara tab kii gai jab unhen is baat kaa abhas hua ki darwin ke siddhant main "vanshanukram gun" jin hai
 The classification of castes of evolution through natural selection has two important assumptions for the discussion of castes - those results fundamentally challenge Linnaeus's hypotheses in favor of taxonomies
 sabase pehle isse yah pataa chalaa ki jatiyaan keval samaan nahin hai balki ve vastav main sambandhit bhi ho sakati he
 Some Darwin students argue that all species are descendants of common ancestors
 doosraa, yah mana jaataa he ki "jati" sajaateey, sthir, sthaayee chijen nahin he; jati ke sadsy bilkul bhinn hai or bahut samay pehle jatiyon main parivartan hua he
 This suggests that castes have no particular boundary region but have statistically significant effects of continuously changing gene-frequencies
 abhi bhi koi vyakti linius ke vargeekaran kaa upyog paudhon or jaanwaron kii pahchaan ke liye kar saktaa he, lekin koi bhi vyakti ab jatiyon ke swatantra or aparivartaneey rup ke bare main soch bhi nahin saktaa
 The development of a new caste from the ancestral lineage is called speciation
 isaki vanshaj jati se purvaj jati kaa nirdhaaran koi spasht vansh vaala simakan nahin he
 However, current scientific knowledge of castes has shown that in all cases there is no concrete and comprehensive way to differentiate between different castes, so that zoologists continue to look for concrete methods to carry out the idea
 
 One of the most popular biological definitions about race is in terms of reproductive isolation, if two animals are not capable of breeding hybrid offspring of both sexes, they belong to different races
 is paribhaasha main sahaj gyaan yukt jatiyon kii simaaen hai, lekin yah apurna hai
 For example, there is nothing to say about the caste that breed asexually and it is very difficult to apply it to the extinct castes
 iske alaava, jatiyon ke bich kii simaaen aksar aspasht hoti hai: aise kai udhaaharan hai jahaan par kisi vishesh aabaadi ke sadsy duusari aabaadi vaale praaniyon ke saadh jananksham sankar vansh kaa prajnan karte hai or duusari aabaadi ke sadsy teesri aabaadi vaale praaniyon ke saadh upjau sankar vansh kaa prajnan kar sakate hai lekin pehali or teesri aabaadi vaale sadsy upjau sankar kaa prajnan nahin kar sakate yaa keval mata pita se hi upjau vansh ko janm sambhav he
 As a result, some people reject this definition of caste
 richard daakins do praaniyon kii vyakhya sajaatiyata ke rup main karte hai or yadi unke chromosomes kii sankhya samaan hoti he or prayek chromosomam ke liye donon praaniyon main samaan sankhya main gunasutra hote hai 
 haalanki, adhiktar sabhi vargeekaran vaigyanik is bate se asahmat honge
 For example, in many amphibians, especially in New Zealand, the genome of Leopelma frogs has "native" genomes that are not distinct and have secondary chromosomes that exist in many combinations
 haalanki, aabaadi ke gunasutron kii sankhya main atyadhik antar paaya jaataa he, phir bhi ye safaltaapurvak antar prajnan kar sakate hai or ek ekal vikaskaari ikai banaate hai
 In plants, polyploidy is a highly common site with some inhibitions on differential reproduction; Because sets of chromosomes of animals are dissected by even numbers, which depends on the actual number of sets of current chromosomes where some animals of the same evolutionary unit can interbreed with some others and some and not the entire population
 Has been specifically linked to form a common gene pool
 jatiyon kaa vargeekaran vishesh taur se takneekee pragati se prabhavit ho rahaa he jisaki anumati shodhakartaaon ne unke sambandh ko anvik nishaan ke aadhaar par, crude rakt plasma vaale teevr pramaanon ko 20veen shatabdi ke madhya main charles sible ke ground-braking DNA-DNA sankaran adhyayan, 1970 main, kii tulana main DNA takanic anukraman ko janm diya
 These techniques resulted in radical changes in the higher taxonomic classes, leading to the rearranged results of many branches of the phylogenetic tree
 For the taxonomic sections of Jainra below, the results were mixed together; At the molecular level, the pace of evolutionary change was slowed, giving clear differences only after a suitable period of reproductive isolation
 While the results of DNA – DNA hybridization were misleading, the Pomeranian Scoa - Great Scoa phenomenon became a well-known example
 kachhue ko aanvik str par anya sarisrup kii gati ke maatr aathven bhaag ke saath viksit hone ke liye nirdhaarit kiya gaya or albatras main aanvik vikaas kii dar storm-petrals kii tulana main lagbhag aadhi hi pai jaati he
 Obsolete hybridization techniques are available nowadays and are replaced by more reliable computational approaches for sequence comparisons

 When a substance is stimulated by giving it electric or heat power, then the colors of different colors start emanating from it
 spectrograph kii sahaayta se inkaa spectrum praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 If the substance is so energized that its molecules are excited, but do not break down into atoms, then small strips, or bands, of different colors are found in the spectrum of rings emitted from them
 aise spectrum ko band spectrum kehete hai
 If too much energy is given to the substance, the molecules break down and the atoms of the substance get excited
 uttejit parmaanuon se jo spectrum praapt hota he, usamen vibhinn varna kii rekhaayen pai jaati hai
 This spectrum is completely different from the band spectrum
 band spectrum anuon se praapt hota he
 Hence it is also called 'molecular spectrum'
 aise spectrum main prayek pattee yaa band kaa ek kinaaraa adhik prakhar dikhaai detaa he
 This edge is called the band head
 band sheersh se pare pattee kii prakharata kramash: ghatati jaati he or doosraa kinaaraa banane se purv hi bahudhaa agle band kaa sheersh aa jaataa he, yaa is band kii prakharata shunya ho jaati he
 If the order of decreasing intensity is from long wave to short wave, the band is degraded to purple and if this sequence is from short to long wave, the band is called red degraded
 achche spectroscope se dekhne par gyaat hota he ki prayek band anek sookshm rekhaon kaa kramik samudaay hota he
 These lines become very dense towards the apex and progressively narrower towards the tail
 band spectrum mukhya rup se do prakaar ke hote hai, avasorana spectrum or utsarjan spectrum 
 Some vapor is absorbed by the vapor when the vapor of the substance is locked in a tube at the proper temperature and pressure, and from it the continuous channels are sent
 kisi padaarth kaa vaashp atyant ucch taap par jin rashmiyon ko utsarjit kar saktaa he unheen rashmiyon ko vah kam taap par avashoshit karata he
 Therefore, dark black bands are found in the continuous spectrum of rocks coming out of the tube
 aise spectrum ko avasorana spectrum kaha jaataa he
 In many gases, band spectrum is also obtained by electrifying at low pressure
 inhen utsarjan spectrum kehete hai
 They are converted into vapor to obtain absorption and emission band spectrum from solids and liquids
 bahut se padaarth parabangnee kirnon ke prabhaav se chamakane lagate he or unase drishy prakaash nikalne lagata he
 This is called fluorescence and phosphorescence
 in vidhiyon dwaara bhi band spectrum praapt kiye jate hai
 First, in 1885, delandre attempted to formulate the wavelengths of the bands at the top of the molecular spectrum, and formulate a table, called the delandre array, to fit them as a rule
 spectrum ke jin bandshirshon kii tarang sankhyaayein ek hi sarini main rakhi ja sakati hai, ve sabhi band milakar ek bandpranali banaate hai
 Small clusters of bands are found in each system
 inhen dilandre sarini kii kisi ek hi pankti yaa ek hi kollam main bharaa ja saktaa he
 These small groups are called band sequences
 prayek band anek rekhaon kaa kramik samudaay hota he
 These lines become clear when taking a photo of a band from a spectrograph with high deflection and resolution, and can be formulated into two, or more, two categories
 jin dwiparmanuk anuon ke parmaanu halke hote hai, unke band kii rekhaayen apekshaakrit viral hoti hai
 The band spectrum of heavier molecules get progressively clearer and their lines of each band can often be divided into dozens of categories

 They are also called 'optical electrons'
 electron ke koniya samveg ke kaaran parmaanu main eletronic urja pai jaati he
 The value of the angular impulse of an electron can be any integer multiple of h / 2π

 Communication is the only way to make information accessible
 takneekee vikaas se sanchaar madhyam bhi viksit hue hai tathaa isse sanchaar ab global phenomeno ban gaya he
 The communication medium is made up of "media" in English, which means connecting two points
 sanchaar madhyam hi sampreshak or shrota ko paraspar jodate hai
 According to Harald Loswell, the main functions of the media are information collection and dissemination, information analysis, communicating social values and knowledge and entertaining people
 sanchaar madhyam kaa prabhaav samaaj main anadikaal se hi rahaa he
 Traditional and modern media are connected with the development process of the society itself

 Communication mainly depends on the nature of the message
 phir jahaan tak sanchaar madhyamon kii prakruti kaa sawaal he to vah sanchaar ke upyogkarta ke saath-saath samaaj se bhi judaa hota he
 Since we also find that the medium of communication stimulates the processes within the society

 Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark was born in Mon Repos on the Greek island of Corfu on 10 June 1921, the only son and fifth and final child of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and Princess Alice of Battenberg
 Philip's four elder sisters were Margarita, Theodora, Cecilie, and Sophie
 He was baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church
 His godparents were Queen Olga of Greece and the Mayor of Corfu
 Shortly after Philip's birth, his maternal grandfather, Prince Louis of Battenberg, then known as Louis Mountbatten, Marquess of Milford Haven, died in London
 Louis was a naturalised British citizen, who, after a career in the Royal Navy, had renounced his German titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten during the First World War
 After visiting London for the memorial, Philip and his mother returned to Greece where Prince Andrew had remained behind to command an army division embroiled in the greco-turkish War 
 The war went badly for Greece, and the Turks made large gains
 On 22 September 1922, Philip's uncle, King Constantine I, was forced to abdicate, and the new military government arrested Prince Andrew, along with others
 The commander of the army, General Georgios Hatzianestis, and five senior politicians were executed
 Prince Andrew's life was believed to be in danger, and Alice was under surveillance
 In December, a revolutionary court banished Prince Andrew from Greece for life
 The British naval vessel HMS Calypso evacuated Prince Andrew's family, with Philip being carried to safety in a cot made from a fruit box
 Philip's family went to France, where they settled in the Paris suburb of saint-cloud in a house lent to them by his aunt, Princess George of Greece and Denmark
 Because he left the country as a baby, he does not have a strong grasp of Greek
 In 1992 Philip said that he "could understand a certain amount of" the language
 Philip was first educated at an American school in Paris run by Donald macjannet, who described Philip as a "rugged, boisterous 


 but always remarkably polite" boy
 In 1928, he was sent to Britain to attend Cheam School, living with his maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace and his uncle, George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, at Lynden Manor in Bray, Berkshire
 In the next three years, his four sisters married German princes and moved to Germany, his mother was placed in an asylum after being diagnosed with schizophrenia, and his father moved to a small flat in Monte Carlo
 Philip had little contact with his mother for the remainder of his childhood
 In 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in Germany, which had the "advantage of saving school fees" Because it was owned by the family of his brother-in-law, Berthold, Margrave of Baden
 With the rise of Nazism in Germany, Salem's Jewish founder, Kurt Hahn, fled persecution and founded Gordonstoun School in Scotland
 After two terms at Salem, Philip moved to Gordonstoun
 In 1937, his sister Cecilie, her husband, her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 her two young sons and her mother-in-law were killed in an air crash at Ostend; Philip, then sixteen years old, attended the funeral in Darmstadt
 The following year, his uncle and guardian Lord Milford Haven died of cancer of the bone marrow
 After leaving Gordonstoun in 1939, Prince Philip joined the Royal Navy, graduating the next year from the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, as the best cadet in his course
 During the Second World War, he continued to serve in the British forces, while two of his brothers-in-law, Prince Christopher of Hesse and Berthold, Margrave of Baden, fought on the opposing German side
 He was commissioned as a midshipman in January 1940
 Philip spent four months on the battleship HMS Ramillies, protecting convoys of the Australian Expeditionary Force in the Indian Ocean, followed by shorter postings on HMS Kent, on HMS Shropshire and in Ceylon 
 After the invasion of Greece by Italy in October 1940, he was transferred from the Indian Ocean to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet
 Among other engagements, Philip was involved in the Battle of Crete, and was mentioned in despatches for his service during the Battle of Cape Matapan, in which he controlled the battleship's searchlights
 He was also awarded the Greek War Cross of Valor
 Duties of lesser glory included stoking the boilers of the troop transport ship RMS Empress of Russia
 He was promoted to sub-lieutenant after a series of courses at Portsmouth in which he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the qualifying examination
 In June 1942, he was appointed to the v and w class destroyer and flotilla leader, HMS Wallace, which was involved in convoy escort tasks on the east coast of Britain, as well as the allied invasion of Sicily
 Promotion to lieutenant followed on 16 July 1942
 In October of the same year he became first lieutenant of HMS Wallace, at 21 years old one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy
 During the invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, as second in command of HMS Wallace, he saved his ship from a night bomber attack
 He devised a plan to launch a raft with smoke floats that successfully distracted the bombers allowing the ship to slip away unnoticed
 In 1944, he moved on to the new destroyer, HMS Whelp, where he saw service with the British Pacific Fleet in the 27th Destroyer Flotilla
 He was present in Tokyo Bay when the instrument of Japanese surrender was signed
 In January 1946, Philip returned to the United Kingdom on the Whelp, and was posted as an instructor at HMS Royal Arthur, the Petty Officers' School in Corsham, Wiltshire
 In 1939, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth
 During the visit, the Queen and Earl Mountbatten asked Philip to escort the King's two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, who were Philip's third cousins through Queen Victoria, and second cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark
 Elizabeth fell in love with Philip and they began to exchange letters when she was thirteen
 Speaking, in the summer of 1946, Philip asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage
 The King granted his request, provided that any formal engagement be delayed until Elizabeth's twenty-first birthday the following April
 By March 1947, Philip had abandoned his Greek and Danish royal titles, had adopted the surname Mountbatten from his mother's family, and had become a naturalized British subject
 Philip and Elizabeth were married in a ceremony at Westminster Abbey, recorded and broadcast by BBC radio to 200 million people around the world
 However, in post-war Britain, it was not acceptable for any of the Duke of Edinburgh's German relations to be invited to the wedding, including Philip's three surviving sisters, all of whom had married German princes, some of them with Nazi connections
 After their marriage, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh took up residence at Clarence House
 Their first two children were born: Prince Charles in 1948 and Princess Anne in 1950
 Philip returned to the navy after his honeymoon, at first in a desk job at the Admiralty, and later on a staff course at the Naval Staff College, Greenwich
 From 1949, he was stationed in Malta after being posted as the first lieutenant of the destroyer HMS Checkers, the lead ship of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean Fleet
 On 16 July 1950, he was promoted lieutenant commander and given command of the frigate HMS Magpie
 He was promoted to commander in 1952, but his active naval career ended in July 1951
 With the King in ill health, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were both appointed to the Privy Council on 4 November 1951, after a coast-to-coast tour of Canada
 At the end of January 1952, Philip and his wife set out on a tour of the Commonwealth
 On 6 February 1952, when they were in Kenya, Elizabeth's father died and she became queen
 It was Philip who broke the news of her father's death to Elizabeth at Sagana Lodge, and the royal party immediately returned to the United Kingdom
 The accession of Elizabeth to the throne brought up the question of the name of the royal house
 The Duke's uncle, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, advocated the name House of Mountbatten, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; However, when Queen Mary, Elizabeth's paternal grandmother, heard of this suggestion, she informed the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who herself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor
 Churchill's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten, whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India, may have contributed to this
 The Duke privately complained, "I am nothing but a bloody amoeba
 On 8 February 1960, several years after the death of Queen Mary and the resignation of Churchill, the Queen issued an Order in Council declaring that the surname of male-line descendants of the Duke and the Queen who are not styled as Royal Highness, or titled as Prince or Princess, was to be mountbatten-windsor
 While it seems the Queen had "absolutely set her heart" on such a change and had it in mind for some time, it occurred only eleven days before the birth of Prince Andrew, and only after three months of protracted correspondence between the constitutional expert Edward Iwi and the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan 
 After her accession to the throne, the Queen also announced that the Duke was to have "place, pre-eminence and precedence" next to her "on all occasions and in all meetings, except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament"
 This meant the Duke took precedence over his son, the Prince of Wales, except, officially, in the British parliament
 In fact, however, he attends Parliament only when escorting the Queen for the annual State Opening of Parliament, where he walks and sits beside her
 Contrary to rumours over the years, the Queen and Duke are said by insiders to have had a strong relationship throughout their marriage, despite the challenges of Elizabeth's reign
 The Queen referred to Prince Philip in a speech on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 as her "constant strength and guide"

 In August, the Evening Standard reported that he was suffering from prostate cancer
 Buckingham Palace, which usually refuses to comment on rumours of ill health, claimed that the report was an invasion of privacy and issued a statement denying the story
 The newspaper retracted the report and admitted it was untrue
 In June 2011, in an interview marking his 90th birthday he said that he would now slow down and reduce his duties, stating that he had "done bit"
 His wife, the Queen, gave him the title Lord High Admiral for his 90th birthday
 While staying at the royal residence at Sandringham, Norfolk, on 23 December 2011, the Duke suffered chest pains and was taken to the cardio-thoracic unit at Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, where he underwent successful coronary angioplasty and stenting
 He was discharged on 27 December
 On 4 June 2012, during the celebrations in honour of his wife's Diamond Jubilee, Philip was taken from Windsor Castle to the King Edward VII Hospital, London, suffering from a bladder infection
 He was released from hospital on 9 June
 After a recurrence of infection in August 2012, while staying at Balmoral Castle, he was admitted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for five nights as a precautionary measure

 His first airborne flying lesson took place in 1952; by his 70th birthday he had accrued 5,150 pilot hours
 He was presented with Royal Air Force wings in 1953
 In April 2014, it was reported that an old British Pathe newsreel film had been discovered of Philip's 1962 two-month flying tour of South America
 Filmed sitting alongside Philip at the aircraft's controls was his co-pilot Peter Middleton, the grandfather of the Duke's granddaughter-in-law, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge
 He has painted with oils, and collected artworks, including contemporary cartoons, which hang at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and Balmoral Castle
 Hugh Casson described Philip's own artwork as "exactly what you'd expect 


 totally direct, no hanging about
 Strong colors, vigorous brushstrokes
" In 1979, when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of US President Jimmy Carter, Prince Philip was approached by White House butler Lynwood Westray and another unnamed butler
 Westray asked him "your majesty, would you like a cordial?", and Prince Philip responded, "i'll take one if you'll let me serve you"
 "oh my God, this had never happened before," said Westray
 "there we were standing there
 i was holding the glasses and my buddy was holding the liqueurs and we looked at each other, and i said 'if that's the only way you'll have it, we'll go along with it
' And the prince served us what he was having, and the three of us had a drink and a conversation
 It was an honour to let him do it
" Over his sixty years as royal consort, Philip has become famous for making remarks that were often construed as being offensive or stereotypical in nature
 Some of them were immediately interpreted as gaffes; but other awkward observations were construed by apologists as merely odd, off-color, and often funny
 In his own words, comments attributed to Prince Philip have contributed to the perception that he is "a cantankerous old sod"
 The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of "HRH Victor Meldrew"
 For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, "no wonder you are deaf listening to this row
" Later Philip wrote, "the story is largely invention
 In a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, "if you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed
" The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were denied unconcerned
 Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go "round-eyed"
 His comment had no effect on sino-british relations, but it shaped his own reputation
