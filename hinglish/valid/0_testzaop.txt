 After the base metal is coated, the outer properties of the metal being coated are visible
 isse vastu kaa bahari rup rang nikhar jaataa he tathaa saath hi vastu sanksharan se bhi bachati he
 The metal to be coated by electrolysis is well attached to the base metal and coating can often be done in a permanent way
 vidyutlepan sajja ke mukhya ansh nimnlikhit hai - 1
 Electrophoresis bath - filled with a metal compound to be coated, which breaks down into metal ions as the current flows and these ions get coated on the base metal surface

 Lapan has another practical difficulty

 ise bahudhaa ispaat par pehla tamra aavaran dene ke liye prayog karte hai or baad main tamra aavaran par nikal athwa chromium kaa lepan kiya jaataa he
 In copper coating also, the first cover is given by copper sulphate after copper cyanide gives the first cover
 chamak paidaa karne ke liye, saadharantaya, kuch sodium thayoslphet bhi lepan bath main mila diya jaataa he
 The stream density is about 100 amperes per square meter for good and durable coating

 The quantity, n, of a substance of a sample or system is a physical quantity, which is proportional to the number of particles that exist in it
 "moulik astitv kan" anu, parmaanu, aayan, electron yaa koi or kan bhi ho sakate hai, jiskaa chunaav sandarbh aadhaarit he or niyat hona chaiye
 padaarth kii matra kabhi kabhi rasinic maatra yaa galat rup main mol kii sankhya bhi kaha jaataa he
 The SI unit for the quantity of a substance is mole
 isaki paribhaasha he: Why use a quantity of a substance instead of a weight or volume to tell how much a substance is? This is because in chemical reactions, molecule to molecule, atom to atom, ion to ion act
 kyonki bhinn anu or parmaanuon kaa bhinn bhaar hota he, 100 gram ke in padaarthon main sabhi main samaan maatra main padaarth nahin hota he
 For example, 100 grams of oxygen contains less than 100 grams of carbon
 dekhen: stoyyometry When stating the quantity of a substance, it is necessary to state the reference existence particle
 a mole chlorine can also mean a chlorine atom and a chlorine molecule
 sanshay ko hataane kii saralatam vidhi he ki "padaarth" shabd ke sthaan par astitv kanon ke naam diye jaayen, yaa amprical sutara bataaya jaye
udaahranarth: This can be called a technical definition of the word "quantity"
 iskaa anuprayog kai vyutpann matraaon main dekha gaya he
 When the amount of substance enters into a derived quantity, it is usually as the denominator: such quantities are known as "molar quantities"
 For example, the quantity which describes the volume occupied by a given amount of substance is called the molar volume, while the quantity which describes the mass of a given amount of substance is the molar mass
 Molar quantities are sometimes denoted by a subscript Latin "m" in the symbol, eg Cp, m, molar heat capacity at constant pressure: the subscript may be omitted if there is no risk of ambiguity, as is often the case in pure chemistry
 The main derived quantity in which amount of substance enters into the numerator is amount of substance concentration, c
 This name is often abbreviated to "amount concentration", except in clinical chemistry where "substance concentration" is the preferred term 
 The name "molar concentration" is incorrect, if commonly used

 gupt samrajya kaa vah samay bharat kaa svarnim yug bhi kaha jaataa he
 Chandragupta II the Great was the son of his former king Samudragupta the Great
 usne aakraamak vistaar kii niti evam laabhdayak parigrahan niti kaa anusaar karke safalataa praapt kii
 Chandragupta II It is clear from Vikramaditya Samudragupta's epigraphy that many of his sons were grandchildren, but in his last time he appointed Chandragupta as his successor
 chandragupta dwitiya evam parvarti guptasamraaton ke abhilekhon se bhi yahi dhvanit hota he ki samudragupta kii mrityu ke uparaant chandragupta dwitiya hi guptasamrat hue
 But on the contrary, some scholars certify Ramgupta as the successor of Samudragupta on the basis of 'devi Chandragupta' and some other literary and archaeological inscriptions available in part
 ramgupta kii ayogyata kaa laabh uthaakar chandragupta ne uske rajya evam rani donon kaa haran kar liya
 The historicity of Ramgupta is doubtful

 The date of Chandragupta II is determined based on his inscriptions etc
 chandragupta kaa, guptasanwat 61 main utkeern mathura stambhalekh, unke rajya ke paanchaven varsh main likhaaya gaya tha
 As a result, he ascended the Guptas in 61-5 = 56 = 375 AD
 chandragupta dwitiya kii antim gyaat tithi unki rajathamudraon par praapt haati he- guptasanwat 90+ 0= 409- 410 i

 From this one can infer that Chandragupta was probably ruling for the above mentioned year
 iske vipareet kumargupta pratham kii pratham gyaat tithi guptasanwat 96= 415 i
, unke bilsand abhilekh se praapt hoti he
 On this basis, it is estimated that the reign of Chandragupta II may have ended in 413–14 AD

 His long-standing presence in the Malava region is evident from the writings of the Gupta Samvat 82 of the feudatory ruler of Chandragupta, Sanakaniq Maharaj, and the Sanchi Gupta Samvat 93 of a magistrate named Amarkardava, obtained from this place

 Chandragupta's army chief Amarkardava, in his Sanchi inscription, calls himself, many Samaravaptavijayyasupatakas
 in anek samaron ke ullekh se yah bhi anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki chandragupta ne shakayuddh ke atirikt anya yuddh bhi kiye honge
 But in the present situation his discussion is unproven

 Chandra has been identified with various emperors of ancient India
 kintu praaia: vidvan unki pahchaan chandragupta dwitiya se karte hai
 If this theory is believed to be correct, then it will not be said that the second Chandragupta defeated the enemies who came in the organization of Vanga region and crossed the seven faces of the Indus and won the Vahlikas

 There are also difficulties in acknowledging Chandra's knowledge with Emperor Chandragupta II

 The famous emperors in literature, Vikramaditya and Chandragupta Vikramvaditya, are both different emperors


 Some people add them and make fun of history

 In order to extract fresh water from a lens for human consumption it is necessary to calculate the permanent yield of the lens based on the weather because each lens is likely to contain saltwater due to over-use or drought
 iske alaava, tsunami or ushnkaribandheey tufaanon se maldive or kai prashanth dwipon main lens gande ho gaye hai
 Standing wells can induce salt deposition in the lens, and over-extraction will reduce freshwater pressure resulting in lateral penetration of seawater

 There are two or three mythological stories about the celebration of Kumbh festival, the most popular of which is the fall of nectar drops from Kumbh, the nectar received from the sea churning by the gods and goddesses
 is katha ke anusaar maharishi durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran jab indra or anya devtaa kamjor ho gaye to daityon ne devataaon par akraman kar unhen parrast kar diya
 Then all the gods together went to Lord Vishnu and told him all the accounts
 tab bhagwaan vishnu ne unhe daityon ke saath milakar kshirsagar kaa manthan karke amrit nikaalane kii salaah di
 At the behest of Lord Vishnu, the entire deity tried to make a treaty with the demons to extract the nectar
 amrit kumbh ke nikalate hi devataaon ke ishaare se indraputra 'jayant' amrit-kalash ko lekar akaash main ud gaya
 The demons then pursued Jayant to take back the nectar as per the order of Shyagacharya and after intense exertion, they caught Jayant in the middle
 tatpashchaat amrit kalash par adhikaar jamaane ke liye dev-daanvon main baarah din tak aviraam yuddh hota rahaa
 During this interconnection, nectar drops fell from the urn at four places of the earth
 us samay chandramaa ne ghat se prasravan hone se, surya ne ghat footne se, guru ne daityon ke apharan se evam shani ne devendra ke bhay se ghat kii raksha kii
 To calm discord, God took the form of a siren and gave it amrit to everyone and gave them drink
 is prakaar dev-daanav yuddh kaa ant kiya gaya
 For the attainment of nectar, there was a continuous war between the dev-danavs for twelve days
 devataaon ke baarah din manushyon ke baarah varsh ke tulya hote hai
 Hence, Aquarius is also twelve
 unamem se chaar kumbh prithvi par hote hai or shesh aath kumbh devloak main hote hai, jinhen devgan hi praapt kar sakate hai, manushyon kii vahaan pahunch nahin he
 When the lunar-sunic planets guarding the current zodiacs are protected at the time when the Chandradikas protect the Kalash, then the sum of Aquarius is there, ie the year in which the Sun, Moon and Jupiter coincide
 That is, in the same year, in the sum of the same zodiac sign, Kumbh festival takes place wherever the nectar drops fell

 yah sangeet bhootpurv travnakor rajya ke mukhyatah naadar or chettiyaar jatiyon main prachlit he
 Dhanush is the main instrument of this music
 longinus paramparaagat rup se "kavy main udaatt tatv" naamak kriti kaa rachanaakaar mana jaataa he
 The effects of good writing are discussed in this work
 longinus kaa asli naam gyaat nahin he
 He was a teacher of Greek Kavyalochan
 uskaa kaal pehali se lekar teesri shadi tak hone kaa anumaan he
 Longinus has proposed this theory considering the elements that make poetry better
 ve udaatt ko kavy ko shreshth banane vaala tathaa kavi ko pratishtha dilaane vaala tatv maanate hai
 It is rooted in the dignity of lofty great ideas organized ornamentation plan, aristocratic designation and influence
 ve vagadambar baleyata or bhavanumbar ko udaadtta main baadhak tatv maanate hai
 Just as in Indian poetry, different views have been made about the nature of poetry and its soul, similarly in the field of western criticism, different thinkers have discovered the origin of poetry or literature in different eras
 plato ne anukaran ko sahitya kaa mul tatva mana
 Pallavan Aristotle did this with his vision and accepted Virechan as the object of literature
 isi prakaar lonzinus kaa udaatt siddhanth he
 Through this theory, he has made it clear that no artwork or poetry can be a masterpiece without a sublime element
 shreshth vahi he jisamen rachayita kaa gahan chintan or anubhutiyaan rahati hai
 This feeling of the creator makes the creation great due to its greatness, sublime, grandeur or dignity
 rachana yaa kriti shilp ke dwaara abhivyakti paati he; kintu udaatt rachana kaa lekhak apni rachana main shilp ke soundarya kii adhik chintaa na karke usamen nihit anubhuti ko hi sabal banane kaa ytn karata he
 Acharya Longines, who presents this sublime principle
 inkaa unani bhashaa kaa naam longinus tathaa angreji bhashaa main uccharit 'lonzinus' he
 His work is titled 'perihutsuus', which was translated into English as 'on the Sublime'
 isi ko hindi main udaatt kii sangya di gai
 Its book is the main text of Western literature
 lonzinus ne udaatt kii paribhaasha or uskaa saamaanya parichay jis rup main diya he usase prathit hota he ki unke samay main yah shabd itnaa adhik prachlit ho gaya tha ki unhone iskaa vistrut parichay dene kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin samajhi
 Still, clarifying the nature of the sublime, he said this much- arthath abhivyakti kii vishistataa or shreshthata kaa naam udaatt he
 By aiming at this, Hindi critics have accepted that the lofty element in a composition is expressed by appropriate and dignified word-legislation, a rhetorical scheme of impulse, and composition-legislation
 lonzinus ne kavy ke udaatt ko vaktruta se ekadam bhinn bataaya he, kyonki kavy main shrotaaon par udaatt kaa prabhaav tanmayata ke rup main hota he, pravartan ke rup main nahin
 For this reason, in the sight of Longinus, there is a grand poem which, due to the joyousness, makes us so engrossed and attuned to reach such a high sense where the subject of the light is illuminated like electric light
 is drushti se lonzinus ko anandatirek or vishwanath ke vigalit-vedyantar main bahut kuch samya dekha ja saktaa he
 In the form of the sublime, both the psychological and the behavioral aspects were exposed in Longinus
 isi se unhone ek ore udaatt ke aantarik tattvon kaa ullekh kiya he or duusari ore uske bahya paksh kii bhi vivechna kii he
 What is Sublime Basis? Is it based on the innate talent of the speaker or writer, or can it be considered by the rise of education or dependent on practice? Longinus has followed the Middle Way, considering these questions
 unke vichaar se udaatt na to sarvatha pratibha saapeksh he or na purnatah abhyaas-saapeksh
 In fact, the basis of the sublime is not one aspect, one quality or one tendency of the person but a glimpse of the entire personality behind it
 atah udaatt kaa sristaa udaatt vyaktitv hi ho saktaa he
 Only a person of great genius, high scholar and celebrity can be a sublime or an announcer
 lonzinus ke anusaar - ‘‘udaatt aatma kii mahanata kaa pratibimb he
 True sublime is attainable only in those whose consciousness is sublime and development oriented
 yah sarvatha swaabhaavik he ki jinke mastishk udaatt dharanaon se paripurna he unheen kii vaani se udaatt shabd zankrut ho sakate hai
 '' is prakaar udaatt kaa sambandh keval pratibha, adhyayan or bhashaa ke adhyayan se nahin, apitu vyakti ke samooche vyaktitv se he
 In conclusion uskaa prabhaav kramik nahin, aakasmik hota he or uske alolik alok se katha chamak uthati he
 Although the foundation of the sublime lies in the greatness of the personality of the litterateur, in order to bring the element of sublime into the composition, Loninus has discussed five sources - uparyukt paanchon tattvon main se pratham do janmajaat arthath kavi-pratibha ke ang hai or shesh teen kala sambandhi visheshtaayen hai
 The first place among the sources of the sublime is the importance of thought
 isi ko lonzinus ne shabd-bhed se aatma kii bhavyata bhi kaha he
 His clear statement is - "the soul of the sublime great is echoed
 ’’ yadi aatma kii yah mahatta naiysargik na ho to utkrisht vichaaron dwaara use praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Great words come out of his mouth in which thoughts are deep and deep
 mahaan vichaaron se sampann, atmotthanayukt sahityakar hi udaatt-srijan kar sakate hai
 This is such a concept of Longinus, to which his concept of sublime effect is also connected
 udaatt kaa prabhaav atmatikraman hota he, anunayan nahin
 This belief specializes that soul-order is possible only with the graceful expression of grand and great ideas
 vastutah atmik mahanata udaatt srujana kii pehali shart he, isiilie udaatt kaa prabhaav bhi natikrup se kalyankari hi mana jayega
 Thus the effect of sublime literature should be considered to be good from both moral and artistic point of view
 is drushti se lonzinus or mahakavi milton ek hi str par utarate hai
 According to Milton, to become a great litterateur one should emulate great and highly honorable things
 milton kaa mat he- Manavis easily get this grand voice
 kabhi-kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki pratibhashali kavi apane jivan ke sandhya kaal main ast hote hue surya kii tarah thanda ho jaataa he or uske parvarti kavy main udaatt kii kami dikhaai dene lagati he
 Homer has the same astral-gamini talent in Odissi
 lonzinus kaa kathan he- ‘‘iliyat homer kii tarunai kii rachana hai, kyonki isamen gati or sangharsh kaa prachurya hai
 In contrast, the majority of the Odyssey are narrative, a product of old age
 ’’ hindi main maithilisharan gupt ke ‘vishnu priya’ or ‘ratnavali’ isi prakaar ke kavy hai, jinamein inaki pratibha kaa apakarsh dekha ja saktaa he
 The later poetry of Pant and Bachchan are also examples of this
 lonzinus ne kalakriti main uddaam aavegon kii anivaaryta par bal diya he, kyonki kriti ke mahaan hone ke liye yah aavashyak he ki pathakon ko bhaavnaatmak uttejnaa pradaan kare
 Emotions or grand impulses are those from which the 'soul' starts to rise on its own and then gets filled with joy
 lonzinus ne aavegon ke do varg banaae hai- ek bhavy or doosraa nimna
 High impulses in grand impulses, ie, exalted emotion, compute probability, respect, amazement, gaiety and valor etc
, while low impulses are associated with compassion, grief and fear
 kavy main udaatt bharne ke liye ucch bhavaveshon kaa grahan tathaa nimna bhavaveshon kaa tyaag hona chahie
 Longinus is of the view that the use of ornaments should be done in such a manner that no one should notice that it is ornamentation
 kala jab kaushalpurvak prayukt kii jaati he to vah apane soundarya or chamatkaar ke vinyas ko kho detii he
 Actually do not marvel at the ornamentation, but it should be for joy
 lonzinus ne athishaymulak alankaaron ko udaatt kaa hetu mana he
 According to him, sublime exists in elaborations like elaborations, oaths, questioning, antonyms, defaults, repetition, articulation, accumulation, essence, transformation, synonyms, exaggeration etc
 atah udaatt ke liye alankaaron kaa sahaj or auchitypurna hona anivaary he
 For example abhijaat abhivyakti se lonzinus kaa taatpary kavy bhashaa he
 He has laid special emphasis on language excellence; Because the expression of sublime is through language
 padaavalee kaa vishayanukool, upyukt prabhaav evam sugumphit hona anivaary he, kyonki urjaswit bhashaa ke prayog dwaara rachanaakaar aisi kriti kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he, jiskaa prabhaav durnivaar ho
 Through appropriate and effective vocabulary, the composition incorporates the qualities of grandeur, dignity, ooze, madave, power etc
 and communicates aliveness
 rachana-vidhaan kaa arth he samanjit shabd-yojana yaa ek nishchit kram se shabdon kii yojana
 According to Longinus, the mutual harmony of various elements makes the work dignified
 jaise sharir ke vibhinn avyavon ke swatantra rahane par koi mahatva nahin he, sabase milane par hi sampoorn sharir kii rachana sambhav hoti he, usee prakaar samast tattvon ke sanyog dwaara hi garimamay kriti kii rachana hoti he
 When all the elements of composition are tied together in a series of harmony, then only they become sublime
 anyathaa vah bikhar jaataa he
 Sometimes the harmony of the composition elements supplies the damage that arises from a particular element of the composition and thus this harmony keeps the sublime effect intact
 atah garimamay evam bhavy rachana-vidhaan bhi udaatt-srijan kaa poshak he
 Longinus has also considered the opposing elements of sublime
 unhone baleyata, asanyat vagvistaar, ast-vyast pad-rachana, hin arth vaale shabd, bhavadambar or shabdaadambar, avaanchit sankshiptata, anaavashyak saaj-sajja, sangeet va lay par atyadhik bal aadi ko udaatt kaa virdohi tatva mana he
 Therefore, the best poet should not place them in his composition
 yah style kaa baari dosha he
 'baleya' literally means 'childish'
 bacchon main jaise chapaltaa, sanyamheenata, halkaapan or kshudrata pai jaati he, vaise hi baleyata kaa dosha us style main mana jayega
 In which to perform the eloquence without restraint, the use of words denoting petty meaning and playful or unstable footsteps
 isamen style kritrim ho jaati he
 According to Longinus- bhav kii garima ke abhaav main alankrita or baari shabdon kaa prayog
 Such as the use of the word 'living samadhi' for a small substance like a deer
 vagadambar udaatt atikaraman ke prayaas se utpann hota he
 Where the author behaves like a drunkard, he often expresses unexpected, meaningless and inconsistent impulses, ie impulse to be expressed even when impulse control is required
 aaveg kii abhivyakti bhavadambar ko janm detii he or udaatt kaa hraas karti he
 The exaggerated statement is rhetoric in the fascination of influencing people
 hindi main bihari ke oohatmak dohe isi dosha se grast hai
 For example, Longinus is of the opinion that the use of the words 'eye-eye' for women, 'chakshu-podak' and 'eye-virgin' for 'effigy' is mere rhetoric, not a metaphor of language
 parvarti samikshakon main higel ne udaatt ke swaroop ko spasht karne ke liye uski tulana soundarya se kii he
 According to him, beauty means harmony
 soundarya main vastu or kala paksh kaa saamanjasy rahata he
 Sublime situation is different from beautiful
 udaatt vah he jahaan uskaa bhav uske rup kii apeksha adhik prashast or vilsht hota he
 Hegel also believes that at the core of the sublime is the excellence of ideas and that the importance of ideas is born from a person's high character
 vyakti kaa charitra mahaan he to uske vichaar bhi mahaan honge
 Edmund Burke clarified the nature of the sublime on the basis of the genius-enriched imagination and the vastness of thought, etc
, by Longeus, that the object or creation has the power to influence and which can surprise the observer with its innovative effect That is, one should understand the sublime
 udaatt-tatva kii rachana kaa udhaaharan ham pyramid tathaa ramcharitra-maanas ke sundar kand main prastut hanuman ke viraat rup, mahabharat main krishna ke viraat rup aadi ko le sakate hai
 Burke has also accepted within the sound of sublime substances such as heavy thunderstorms, huge falls, lightning thunder, howls of cannons also have sublimate elements
 vastutah soundarya kii apeksha akkhadpan udaatt se adhik nikat hai
 Anand's reputation as a poet-work is such a gift of Longines that distinguishes him on the one hand from a rhetorician like Horace and on the other from a poetess like Aristotle
 arestu kaa virechan ek prakaar kaa upachaar he, jisaki pariklpana visheshkar traasadee ke sandarbh main kii gai he, jabaki lonzinus kaa ‘anand’ ek uplabdhi he, jiskaa poshak aadhaar mahakavy traasadee, pragit aadi sabhi tak vistrut hai
 In fact, the sublime has been discussed and analyzed the most in the 'peri Ipsus' of Longines
 lonzinus kaa udaatt siddhanth paashchaatya samiksha kii dein he
 His 'sublime' is an expression of the earned side of life, there is no place for the sweet side
 atah jivan ke aadhe paksh kaa vivechan karne ke kaaran unka shaastra adhuraa he
 Where is the perfection of Indian poetry, which also has the melody with oz
 ek ore vir or adbhut ras he to duusari ore shringaar or hasya ras hai
 He is a complete human work
 lonzinus kii dharna main is ekangita kaa kaaran yah he ki usne apane granth kii rachana bhaashan-shaastra ke rup main kii thi, kavyashastra ke rup main nahin
 That is why the interpretation of important elements for successful speech is found in it

 bhashavigyaan ke antargat arthvigyaan yaa 'shabdaarthvigyaan' shabdon ke arth se sambandhit vidha he
 The study of the meaning of words and sentences in the realm of language is called semantics
 unnisvin sadi ke uttarardh se pehle arth-vigyaan ko ek alag anushaasan ke rup main manyata nahin thi
 The French philosopher Michel Brill founded this discipline and named it 'cementics'
 beesvin sadi kii shuruyaat main fardinaind da sasyur dwaara pravartit bhashaai kranti ke baad se cementics ke pair samaaj-vigyaan main jamate chale gayi
 The first task of cementics is to identify linguistic categories and interpret them in appropriate terminology
 upar se sahaj par bheetar se pechida lagane vaali arth- sambandhi kavayaden cementics kii madad ke bina nahin ho saktin
 For example, the usefulness of cementics can be ascertained by looking at the difference in meaning between 'mortal is people' and 'mortal was Gandhi'
 duusare vaakya kaa nihitarth yah he ki gandhi ko amar mana jaataa tha yaa gandhi jaise log bhi nashwar hote hai
 Cementics explores how language works to make this difference of meaning
 vicitra baat yah he ki arth-vigyaan par shuruyaat main bhashaa-shastriyon bajaay ne gahari daali
 From the sixties linguists began to outline two basic types of linguistic meanings
 mana gaya ki arth kii pehali kism to bhashaai rup main hi sahjaat hoti he
 The second type is related to the interaction between the form spoken and the context of that expression
 ke arth-nirupan teen ke vibhedon ke tahat kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The first of these is the difference between perception and context
 doosraa he shabd ke arth or vaakya ke arth kaa bhed
 The third is the difference between text and context
 is tisare antar ko ab cementics se alag karke bhashaa-shastriyon ne pregamatics ke rup main nayaa anushaasan bana diya gaya he
 Under Cementics, the language that is studied is called the target language and the language in which it is interpreted is called the metalingual
 ek lakshya-bhashaa apni vyakhya ke metaalenguage bhoomika adaa sakati he
 In the history of linguistics, the metaphorical exercises were first word-centered, then they were sentence-centered and then they became text-centered
 in teenon prakriyaaon ne media-adhyayan, saahityalochana, vyaakhyaatmak samajashaastra or sangyanatmak vigyaan ke anushasano ko prabhavit kiya he
 Cementics raises the question whether the meaning of a word should be identified within the scope of the language or help is also taken from outside its scope for interpretation
 masalan, kursi kaa matlab hamen pataa he, par, yah arth ham kis prakaar hasil karte hai? ham kah sakate han ki kursi par baitha jaataa he
 However, within the language the meaning of the chair is also assumed with its relation to other meanings such as furniture, table, seat or bench
 in shabdon ke saath rakh kar baithne ke liye kaam aane vaali kursi kaa arth-grahan alag ho jaataa he
 Another example of the difference between perception and reference is the planet Venus or Venus
 ise bhor kaa tara bhi kaha jaataa he or sandhya-tara bhi, kyonki isaki chamak subah bhi dikhaayi padati he or raat main bhi
 In this way Venus, the morning star and evening star are three names of the same thing
 lekin sandarbh ek hi hote hue bhi teenon ko alag-alag bodh ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The emphasis of cementics is less on context and more on perception, because it wants to eclipse, so that the understanding of reality can also be achieved through language and for that, culture, history and other physical processes Is not important
 bhashaa ke bheetar shabdaarth praapt karne ke liye cementics main teen mukhya sambandhon samanarthak, vilomarthak or hyponomical kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 Hyponimical categories are those that include word expressions
 jaise, kutta kisi billi, bandar, jiraph yaa khargosh kii tarah ek pashu bhi he or saath main vah terrior, hound, german sheoard yaa ritreaver bhi ho saktaa he
 It is worth noting that these three forms are used to create meaning within a well-defined linguistic system, but this does not mean that social and community processes of meaning-making and meaning-making are also pertinent
 masalan, koi aisa samudaay bhi ho saktaa he jo in teen sambandhon ke bina arthath bhashaa ke daayre ke baahar shabdon kii arth-rachana karata ho
 In North American, Hopi is such that the same word is used instead of different for all things except birds
 is kabeeley ke log machhar, gubbaaraa or hawaii jahaaz yaa aisi hi kisi chiz ko ‘masaytaka’ naam dete hai
 Taking sentences through sentences also comes under the scope of cementics
 ‘ramesh ne umesh se makaan karidaa’ darasal ‘umesh ne ramesh ko makaan bechaa’ kaa samanarthak he
 a similar synonym is between 'the police have arrested the agitators' and 'the agitators have been arrested by the police'
 isi tarah vaakyon ke bich duusare arth-sambandh banate hai
 For example, the connection between 'osama bin Laden killed at the hands of American commando unit' and 'osama bin Laden killed' can be seen
 agar pehle vaakya ke mutabik america commando unit ne osama ko vastav main maar daalaa he, to doosraa vaakya bhi jis yatharth kaa nirupan karnaa chahta he use sach maan liya jayega
 In addition to the dependence of one sentence on the other in terms of meaning, the sentences also depend on the pre-recognition inherent in it for its meaning
 jaise : ‘raksha mantralay ke ek vaktavy ke anusaar bharat ko un shaktiyon kaa prayog karnaa chahie jinase pakistan ko seemaa-paar se hone vaale antakawaad ko protsaahit karne se roka ja sake’
 There are two pre-beliefs in this sentence: first, India has the necessary powers and second, Pakistan is promoting cross-border terrorism
 pichley das saal main cementics or pregamatics ke kshetron main jabardast bhashaa-shastreey kaam hua he
 These semantic exercises that distinguish between the meanings of sentences and words may seem trivial from the top, but their importance cannot be denied to reveal the underlying ideological implications and contrivances in a text
 cementics or pregamatics kaa sahaara lekar raajnneeti-vigyaan ke kai padon main hue arth sambandhi parivartanon kaa adhyayan bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, democracy has been interpreted as a system of disorganized and chaotic system of ordinary people or their crowd for a long time since the time of Aristotle
 lekin aaj loktantr ek vyavasthit kriyavidhi ke mutabik kaam karne vaali vyavastha ke arth main rudh ho gaya he
 Therefore, as soon as someone demands direct intervention in the processes of demand or movement, it starts to be declared a threat to the system
 bharat main jaiprakash narayan ke netritv main chale sampoorn kranti andolan ne pratinidhi vaapasi ke adhikaar kii maang karke aisi hi arth-sambandhi bechainiyaan paidaa kii thim
 The anti-corruption movement led by Anna Hazare has also introduced economic problems related to democracy
 ab yah bhashaa-shastriyon or loktantr ke chintakon kaa kaam he ki ve loktantr ke arth main aaye is parivartan kii arth-vaigyanik vyakhya karen
