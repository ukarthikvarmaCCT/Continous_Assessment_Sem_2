 The story of the fourth effigy Kamakandala also reveals Vikramaditya's spirit of charity and sacrifice
 vah is prakaar he- One day King Vikramaditya was addressing the court when someone informed that a Brahmin wanted to meet him
 vikramaditya ne kaha ki brahman ko andar laayaa jaae
 When the Brahmin met him, Vikram asked for the purpose of his coming
 brahman ne kaha ki vah kisi daan kii ichha se nahin aayaa he, balki unhen kuch batalaane aayaa he
 He told that at sunrise in Mansarovar, a pillar appears which spreads the sunlight as it rises and touches the sun when the sun's heat is at its peak
 jyon-jyon surya kii garmi ghatati he chota hota jaataa he tathaa suryaast hote hi jal main villin ho jaataa he
 Vikram got curious about what the Brahmin meant by this
 brahman unki jigyaasa ko bhaanp gaya or usne batalaaya ki bhagwaan indra kaa doot banakar vah aayaa he taaki unke aatmavishvaas kii raksha vikram kar saken
 He said that the sun god is proud that no one in the entire universe except the sea god can bear his heat
 devraj indra unki is baat se sahamat nahin hai
 He believes that a king of his compassionate death can go near him without caring about the heat of the sun
 vah raja aap hai
 King Vikramaditya now understood the whole thing
 unhone soch liya ki pranotsarg karke bhi surya bhagwaan ko sameep se jaakar namaskara karenge tathaa devraj ke aatmavishvaas kii raksha karenge
 He left the Brahmin by giving proper donations and Dakshina and started thinking of ways to make his plan work
 unhen is baat kii khushi thi ki devatagan bhi unhen yogya samajhate hai
 At dawn, he left his kingdom and left for the next day
 ekaant main unhone maan kaali dwaara pradutt donon betaalon kaa samaran kiya
 Both betals immediately appeared
 vikram ko unhone bataaya ki unhen us khambhe ke bare main sab kuch pataa he
 Both betals brought him to the banks of Mansarovar
 raat unhone hariyaali se bhari jagah par kaati or bhor hote hi us jagah par nazar tikaa di jahaan se khambha prakat hota
 As the sun's rays touched the waters of Mansarovar, a pillar appeared
 vikram turant tairkar us khambhe tak pahunche
 As Vikram climbed the pole, there was a stir in the water and the waves started touching Vikram's feet
 jyon-jyon surya kii garmi badhi, khambha badhata rahaa
 By noon, the pillar came very close to the sun
 tab tak vikram kaa sharir jalakar bilkul raakh ho gaya tha
 When the Sun God found a human being burnt on the pole, he did not take any time to understand that there would be no one except Vikram
 unhone bhagwaan indra ke daawey ko bilkul sach paaya
 He resurrected Vikram from the drops of nectar and took off his golden coil and presented it to them
 un kundalon kii visheshta thi ki koi bhi icchit vastu ve kabhi bhi pradaan kar dete
 When the sun god extended his chariot in the direction of Asthachal, the pillar began to decrease
 suryaast hote hi khambha puri tarah ghat gaya or vikram jal par tairne lage
 Swim came to the banks of the lake and remembered the two belts
 vetaal unhen phir usee jagah laae jahaan se unhen sarovar le gaye the
 Vikram walked on foot towards his castle
 kuch hi dur par ek brahman mila jisane unase ve kundal maang liye

 siddharth ke pita shaakyon ke raja shuddhodan the
 According to the traditional tale, Siddhartha's mother Mahamaya died some time after his birth
 kaha jaataa he ki unka naam rakhane ke liye 8 rishiyo ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha, sabhi ne 2 sambhaavnaayen bataai thi, ve ek mahaan raja banenge ve ek sadhu yaa parivrajak banenge
 Hearing this speech, King Shuddhodana tried hard not to allow Siddhartha to become a monk to the extent of his ability
 shaakyon kaa apana ek sangh tha
 At the age of twenty, every Shakya Tarun had to be initiated into Shakya Sangha and become a member of the Sangh

 Both Shakya and Koli used to irrigate their fields with the waters of the Rohini River
 har fasal par unka aapas main vivaad hota tha ki koun rohinee ke jal kaa pehle or kitna upyog karegaa
 These disputes sometimes turned into fights and battles
 jab siddharth 28 varsh ke the, rohni ke pani ko lekar shakya or coliyon ke naukaron main jhagada hua jisamen donon ore ke log ghayal huye
 On finding out the quarrel, Shakyas and Kolis thought that why should this dispute be resolved by war forever
 shaakyon ke senapati ne coliyon ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke prashn par vichaar karne ke liye shakyasang kaa ek adhiveshan bulaayaa or sangh ke samaksh yuddh kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Siddharth Gautam opposed this proposal and said that war does not solve any question, war will not serve any purpose, it will lead to the planting of another war
 siddharth ne kaha meraa prastaav he ki ham apane main se do aadmi chune or coliyon se bhi do aadmi chunane ko kahen
 Then these four together choose a fifth man
 ye paanchon aadmi milakar jhagade kaa samaadhaan karen
 Siddharth's proposal was invalidated by a majority, and Shakya Senapati's proposal for war was passed by an overwhelming majority
 shakyasang or shakya senapati se vivaad na sulajhane par antatah siddharth ke paas teen vikalp aaye
 Among the three options, he had to choose one option, joining the army, participating in war, agreeing to social boycott of his family and the confiscation of his fields, hanging or accepting expulsion
 unhone teesraa vikalp chunaa or parivrajak banakar desh chhodane ke liye raji ho gaye
 Siddhartha first started finding answers to his questions with the five Brahmins by becoming a Parivrajaka
 ve uchit dhyaan hasil kar paae, parantu unhen apane prashnon ke uttar nahin mili
 Then he tried to do penance
 ve is kaary main bhi ve apane guruon se bhi zyaada, nipun nikle, parantu unhe apane prashnon ke uttar fir bhi nahin mili
 Then he gathered some companions and went on to do more rigorous penance
 aise karte karte chah varsh baad, bina apane prashnon ke uttar paaen, bhukh ke kaaran mrityu ke kareeb se guzare, ve fir kuch or karne ke bare main sochane lage
 At this time, he remembered a moment of his childhood, when his father was starting to prepare the farm
 us samay ve ek anand bhare dhyaan main pad gayi the or unhe aisa mahasoos hua tha ki samay sthir ho gaya he
 Leaving hard austerities, he found an asexual path, which is also called the middle path, because this path is in the midst of both the austerities and the greatness of incontinence
 apane badan main kuch shakti daalane ke liye, unhone ek bakrii-vaale se kuch doodh le liya
 He sat under a peepal tree, promising that he would not rise without knowing the truth
 35 kii umr par, unhone bodhi pai or ve buddha ban gayi
 His first sermon was in Sarnath near Varanasi
 apane baaki ke 45 varsh ke liye, gautam buddha ne ganga nadi ke aas-paas apana dharmopadesh diya, dhanwaan or kangaal logon dono ko
 He also founded a union of two ascetics who continued to spread the sermon of the Buddha
 tripitak buddha dharm kaa mukhya granth he
 It is written in Palibhasha
 yah granth buddha ke parinirvana ke pashchaat buddha ke dwaara diya gaya upadeshau ko sutarabaddh karne kaa sabase vrihad prayaas he
 The sermon of Buddha is presented as a sutra in this book
 sutron ko varg main baandha gaya he
 The wag is included in the body or in the section
 nikaayon ko pitak main ekikrut kiya gaya he
 In this way three Pitakas are formed whose combination is called tri-pitaka
 palibhasha kaa tripitak theravaadi buddha parampara main srilanka, thailand, burma, laos, cambodia, bharat aadi raashtra ke buddha dharm anuyaayi paalna karte he
 Pali's Tipitaka is also translated into Sanskrit, which is called Tripitaka
 sanskrit kaa purna tripitak abhi anuplabdh he
 Presently the surviving tradition of Sanskrit Tripitaka Purpose is available only in the Newar caste of Nepal
 is ke alaava tibet, china, mongolia, japan, korea, vietnam, malaysia, rus aadi desh main sanskrit mul mantra ke saath main sthaneey bhashaa main buddha sahitya parampara paalna karte he
 After the Mahaparinirvana of Gautama Buddha, different sects of Buddhism have become present, but all of them have many theories
 tathagat buddha ne apane anuyaayion ko chaar aryasaty, ashtangik maarg, das parmita, panchasheel aadi shikshaaon ko pradaan kiye hai
 The first sermon of the Tathagata Buddha, which he had given to some of his sages, was about these four Aryan truths
 buddha ne chaar arya satya bataaye hai
 There is sorrow in this world
 janm main, boode hone main, beemaari main, maut main, priyatam se dur hone main, naapsand chizon ke saath main, chahat ko na paane main, sab main dukh he
 Trishna, or desire, is the cause of sorrow and continues the world with renewed vigor
 trishna se mukti pai ja sakati he
 Salvation from craving can be attained by living according to the ascendant path
 saanchaa:main:ashtangik maarg According to Buddhism, the Arya Ashtanga Path of the Fourth Arya Truth is the way to stop suffering
 gautam buddha kehete the ki chaar arya satya kii satyata kaa nishchay karne ke liye is maarg kaa anusaran karnaa chahie : 1
 Right view: Believing in the Four Noble Truths 2
 Right resolutions: Promising mental and moral development 3
 Right speech: Do not speak harmful things and lie 4
 Right actions: Do not do harmful actions 5
 Right life: Any Do not even directly or indirectly do harmful business 6
 Right efforts: Trying to improve oneself 7
 Right memory: Trying to get mental ability to see with clear knowledge 8
 Yk tombstone: Achieve Nirvana and loss of self kuch log arya ashtaang maarg ko path kii tarah samajhate he, jisamen aage badhane ke liye, pichley ke str ko paanaa aavashyak he
 And people feel that the levels of this passage are found all together
 maarg ko teen hisson main vargeekrut kiya jaataa he : pragna, sheel or samadhi
 Lord Buddha has taught his followers to follow the five Shilohs
 pali main – panatipaata vermani sikkhapadam sammaadiami ! Meaning - i take the instruction to be free from animal violence
 paali main – adinnadana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to keep away from theft
 paali main – kamesoomichhachara vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to desist from adultery
 paali nen – musavada vermana sikhapadam samaadiami Meaning - i take the instruction to refrain from lying
 paali main – surameray majjapamadthatana vermana sikhapadam samaadiami
 Meaning - i take the education of drinking liquor, raw liquor and abstaining from intoxicants
 gautam buddha se pai gai gyaanata ko bodhi kehalaate he
 It is believed that only after getting Bodhi can be rid of the world
 sari parmitaaon kii nishpatti, chaar arya satyon kii puri samaj or karm ke nirodh se hi bodhi pai ja sakati he
 At this time, greed, guilt, fascination, avidya, craving and belief in the soul all disappear
 bodhi ke teen str hote he shravakbodhi, pratyekbodhi or samyaksambodhi
 Samyakasambodhi is considered the most advanced ideal of Buddhism
 gautam buddha ke mahaparinirvana ke baad, buddha dharm ke alag-alag sampradaay upasthit ho gayi hai, parantu in sab ke bahut se siddhant milte hai
 All Buddhist sects follow the basic principles of the Tathagata Buddha
 prathithyasamutpaada kaa siddhant kahata he ki koi bhi ghatana keval duusari ghatnaon ke kaaran hi ek jatil kaaran-parinaam ke jaal main vidyaman hoti he
 For beings, it means the cycle of infinite worlds according to karma and vipak
 kyonki sab kuch anitya or anaatman hota he, kuch bhi sach main vidyaman nahin he
 Every event is basically zero
 parantu, maanav, jinke paas gyaan kii shakti he, trishna ko, jo dukh kaa kaaran he, tyagkar, trishna main nasht kii hui shakti ko gyaan or dhyaan main badalakar, nirvana paa sakate hai
 Everything in this world is transitory and mortal
 kuch bhi sthaayee nahin
 But there is opposition from Vedic faith
 aatma kaa arth 'mai' hota he
 However, beings are made of body and mind, which do not have stability
 kshan-kshan badlaav hota he
 Therefore, there is no permanent thing called 'I' meaning soul
 jise log aatma samajhate hai, wo chetana kaa avichhinn pravaah he
 The mind has replaced the soul
 buddha ne brahm-jaal suta main sristi kaa nirmaan kaisaa hua, ye bataaya he
 The creation is created and destroyed again and again
 ishwar yaa mahabrahma sristi kaa nirmaan nahi karte kyonki duniya prathithyasamutpaada arthath kaarykaran-bhav ke niyam par chalati he
 According to Lord Buddha, karma is responsible for the grief and happiness of humans, not God or Mahabrahma
 par anya jagah buddha ne sarvocch satya ko avarnaneey kaha he
 Nothingness is the predominant philosophy of the Mahayana Buddhist sect
 vah apane hi sampradaay ke logon ko mahatv dete hai
 Buddhism does not mean pessimism
 dukh kaa matlab nirashavad nahin he, lekin saapekshavaad or yatharthwaad he
 Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are the three triratnas of Buddhism
 bhikshu, bhikshuni, upsakaa or upsika sangh ke chaar avyav hai
 The full observance of the ten parameters is called the Bodhisattva
 bodhisattva jab das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kar lete hai tab "buddha" kehalaate hai
 Becoming a Buddha is the culmination of a Bodhisattva's life
 is pahchaan ko bodhi naam diya gaya he
 Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have only one Buddha - there were many before him and there will be more in the future
 unka kahana tha ki koi bhi buddha ban saktaa he agar vah das parmitaaon kaa purna paalan karte hue bodhisattva praapt kare or bodhisattva ke baad das balon yaa bhoomiyon ko praapt kare
 The ultimate goal of Buddhism is the end of suffering from the entire human society
 "main keval ek hi padaarth sikhaata hoon - dukh he, dukh kaa kaaran he, dukh kaa nirodh he, or dukh ke nirodh kaa maarg he" 
 Followers of Buddhism walk on the asexual path and live according to it and try to get rid of ignorance and sorrow and attain nirvana
 buddha dharm main sangh kaa bada sthaan he
 In this religion Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are called 'triratna'
 sangh ke niyam ke bare main gautam buddha ne kaha tha ki chote niyam bhikshugan parivartan kar sakate he
 After their Mahaparinirvan, there was a huge increase in the size of the Sangh
 is vruddhi ke pashchaat vibhinn kshetra, samskruti, saamaajik avasthaa, diksha, aadi ke aadhaar par bhinn log buddha dharm se aabaddh hue or sangh kaa niyam dhire-dhire parivartan hone laga
 At the same time, in the Kalam Sutta of Angushava Nikaya, Buddha has given freedom to practice religion on the basis of his experience
 atah, vinay ke niyam main parimarjan / parivartan, sthaneey saanskrithik / bhashik paksh, vyaktigat dharm kaa swatantrata, dharm ke nishchit paksh main zyada vaa kam jod aadi kaaran se buddha dharm main vibhinn sampradaay vaa sangh main parimarjeet hue
 Presently, the major sect or creed in these sanghas are Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana

 Apart from this pillar there is a statue of Buddha in a Samadhi Stupa
 nepal sarkaar ne bhi yahaan par do stupa or banawaye hai
 Even after wandering near various places and various gurus for six years, Buddha did not get the ultimate knowledge anywhere
 iske baad ve gaya pahunche
 In the end, he vowed that until real knowledge is available, he will not rise from under the Peepal tree, even if he dies
 iske baad kareeb chah din tak din raat ek pipal vriksh ke neeche bhukhe-pyaase tap kiya
 Eventually he attained supreme knowledge or wisdom

 tathaa, rashtramandal pradeshon ke bich kaa sambandh is prakaar kaa he ki uttaradhikaar ko anushaasit karne vaale kisi bhi vidhaan kaa saare deshon kii ekamat sweekruti aavashyak he

 Upon the demise of a governing ruler, the royalty automatically goes to his immediate heir, so theoretically, the throne does not remain empty even for a moment
 tathaa uttaradhikaar ko saarvajanik rup se uttaradhikaar parishad dwaara ghoshit kii jaati he
 Therefore, according to English tradition, coronation is not necessary for the succession of the ruler to be valid

 The routine function of the blood corpus involves testing blood of both donors and recipients so that each recipient receives the blood that is as appropriate and as safe as possible if there is a blood transfusion between the donor and the recipient of a unit of incompatible blood

 The danger can be further reduced by cross-matching the blood, but lock it when blood is needed for an emergency
 For cross-matching, donor and recipient blood are mixed and tested to allow the mixture to attach or to form clots if clear attached to the naked eye
 If not, technologists usually use a microscope to examine it
 If agglutination occurs, that donor's blood cannot be transfused to the recipient
 The blood corpus is required to correctly identify all blood samples

 Thereafter, he wrote a commentary on the first Nag Dhammasanani of Abhidhammapitka called Eighthasalini
 unhone tripitak kii attakatha likhnaa bhi aarambh kiya
 His guru Ravat told him that only the original Pali Tripitaka could come from Lanka in India, the attakathas compiled by his Mahasthavira Mahendra exist in the Sinhalese island of Lanka
 atev tumhen vahiin jaakar unako sunanaa chahie or phir unka magadhi bhashaa main anuwaad karnaa chahie
 Accordingly Buddhaghosha went to Lanka

 Arriving there, he listened to the Sinhalese story and the tradition of Stalism from a place called Sanghapal in the Mahavihara of Anuradhapura
 buddhaghosh ko nishchay ho gaya ki dharm ke adhinaayak buddha kaa vahi abhipraay he
 He expressed his intention to adapt the legend from the monks there
 isapar sangh ne unki yogyata kii pariksha karne ke liye "anto jataa, bahi jataa" aadi do pracheen gaathaayen dekar unki vyakhya karne ko kaha
 Buddhaghosa composed Visudhimagga as his explanation, which the Sangh was very pleased to see and considered him the incarnation of the future Buddha Maitreya
 tatpashchaat unhone anuradhpur ke hi granthkaar vihaar main baithkar sinhalai attakathaon kaa magadhi roopaantar puraa kiya or tatpashchaat bharat laut aae

 barnard ek alfaa purush he lekin vah janm-prakriya main kisi galati se qad kaa chota rah gaya he
 Because the stature is a sign of lower categories, there is a shame in Bernard about this
 barnard kaa ek helmholtz naam kaa mitra he
 Helmholtz is tall, powerful and attractive
 lekin ise kavita likhane or akele rahane kaa shauq he, isliye usne barnard ko ek ajeeb alfaa dekhakar apana humaraaz bana liya he
 Bernard wants to attract Lenina so takes her on a reserved field trip
 vahaan barnard lenina ko aakarshith karne main asamarth rahata he, lekin unhen vahaan ek linda naam kii aurat milti he
 Linda was actually a simple woman who came to the reserve area and got stuck there
 uskaa ek putr he, jon
 It is known that John is actually the son of Bernard's operator with whom Linda had physical relationships
 linda jab aarakshan par rah gai to usne vahaan vahi kiya jo vah landan main karti thi - usne sabhi purushon se sambandh rakhe, jis se use vahaan ek giri hui stri samajha jane laga or us ke saath log ghrinaa se pesh aate the
 He told John a lot about the beautiful world outside the reservation, so John wants to go to London
 barnard kii thomas se ladaai chal rahi he kyonki thomas us se kaam par krurta se pesh aata he
 Bernard thought that John would be taken in front of Thomas and it would be very insulting to Thomas because in that society it is considered shameful to have any kind of identification and relationship with children
 landan lautate hi thomas saare sahakartaaon ke aage barnard par chillane lagata he
 Bernard turns John and Linda ahead of him in revenge
 jon apane pita ke aage ghutane tekkar use apana pita hone kaa vaasta detaa he
 This makes Thomas laugh at Thomas and he resigns from the job in shame
 barnard jon ko landan main sabase milwataa he
 John's methods are different and suit the women of London
 vah ek junglee aarakshan se aayaa he isliye uskaa naam junglee jon pad jaataa he
 Every woman wants to have sex with him
 is chakkar main barnard swayan bahut lokapriy ho jaataa he
 John and Helmholtz also become friends
 lekin kuch samay main jon ko yah samaaj khaali or vyarth kaamon main juta hua lagane lagata he
 John's mother comes back and remains drunk with Mon and dies in hospital one day
 jon rosh main aakar puure hospital kaa som baahar phenk detaa he
 In this difficult time of John, Bernard does not help him but Helmholtz plays a friend
 barnard, helmholtz or jon ko ek pramukh adhikari, mustafaa mond, ke aage pesh kiya jaataa he
 In the dialogue of these four, interesting things have been shown on the principles and issues of this society
 barnard or helmholtz ko deshnikala dekar ek dur-daraaj ke dweep samooh par bhej diya jaataa he
 John is said that his presence is an exercise in the government's interest and he will be allowed to stay in London
 lekin jon logon se dur rahane lagata he
 He also blames himself for his mother's death and in this guilt he punishes himself by whipping himself
 vah yah karte hue dekha jaataa he or khud logon ke liye manoranjan kaa saadhan ban jaataa he
 He comes to see it and makes him so unhappy with his behavior that he hangs himself and dies

 aadhunik bhartiya sahitya main bhi andaha ko kabhi khatare or kabhi saahas ke pratik ke rup main prayog kiya gaya he
 Harivansh Rai Bachchan, in his famous poem "soor Samar Karene Karhin" titled "do rocks," shows Azhada as a victim of persecution and deafness to the logic of truth which can only be spoken by the use of force
