 After the speech, some people gave more encouragement and some sat down mumbling

 da second sex simon da bauaar dwaara french main likhi gai pustak he jisane stri sambandhi dharanaon or vimarshon ko gahare taur par prabhavit kiya he
 This book by Simone with feminist ideology presents feminist existentialism effectively
 yah sthapit karti he ki stri janm nahin leti he balki jivan main badhane ke saath banaai jaati he
 His interpretation offers the concept of "second" in keeping with Hegel's thinking
 unki is sankalpana ke anusaar, nari ko uske jivan main uski pasand-naapsand ke anusaar rahanaa or kaam karne kaa haq hona chahie or wo purush se samaaj main aage bad sakati he
 By doing this, she can move forward from stability to pursue her life towards superiority
 aisa karne se nari ko unke jivan main karttavya ke chakravyuuh se nikal kar swatantra jivan kii ore kadam badhaane kaa hausala miltaa hai
 The second gender is an ESI book, which challenges the social, political, and religious rules of Europe, which have always hindered female existence and female progress, and placed women below men
 apni is pustak main main beowaur purushon ke dhakoslon se nari jaati ko lad kar unke jivan main aayi badhaayo par soch na karne kii niti ke vishay main apane vichaar pradaan kiye hai
 It was translated into Hindi as Stree Upekshita
 da second sex asal main le temps modernes ke sheershak se likhi gayi thi, jo june 1949 main chhaapi gayi thi
 The second part of this book was published a few months after the first part was published
 howard parshle ke dwaara angraji main anuwaad ke turant baad hi donon bhaag america main jald hi prakashit kii gayi thi
 Howard proposed to translate on Alfred Knopf's wife, Blanche Knopf
 chunki howard ko french bohot kam maatr main samaj aati thi or darshan-gyaan main unki koi ruchi athwa samaj na hone ke kaaran unhone kaaphi had tak anuwaad kaa kaam galat kiya tha
 He taught biology at Smith College
 kaaphi saalon baad, 2009 main, asal prakashit french pustak kii sathvin saalagirah ke avasar par, donon bhaago kii ek duusari anuvaadit pustak prakashit kii gayi thi
 Beauvoir anticipated her ideology from two different women, Erica Jong and Germain Greer, who supported women's abstinence
 “nari: myth yaa satya” ek aisa adhyay he, jahaan lekhika beovior kahati hai ki kis tarah purush ne samaaj main mahila ko “dusre” kaa darja diya hai
 She says that men have created false rules and laws around women, keeping them in the assurance that men are superior in their place
 lekhika kaa maananaa tha kii aisa karke purush ne striyon kii pareshaaniyon ko samajhane se haath dho liye the or un ke jhuthe dhakoslon ne striyon ko samaaj main hameshaa unke neeche band ke rakhane main unki sahaayta kii hai
 Beauvoir believes that the same pressure has been seen in other parts of the society, for example, in society, fanatical and petty-minded hypocrites have spread many quarrels and discriminations about color, caste, and religion
 par unka maananaa he ki sastri jaati ko jitna samaaj ke itihaas main dabaaya gaya he, vaisaa kisi dharm va jaati ko nahin dabaaya gaya hai
 By keeping women below themselves, hypocritical men have not maintained their high place in society
 apni pustak main beovoir ne aise hi kai vichaaron ko ujagar kii he, jo samaaj kii reet athwa niyamon ko chunauti detii hai
 They have said that women have been considered weak and physically and mentally abnormal and for this reason women have not got proper opportunities anywhere
 nari ko hameshaa yah aashwaasan diya gaya hai ki ve kamazor hai or unhen sthir va saamaanya rahane ke liye purusho ke maarg-darshan par chalanaa chahie
 Before the publication of The Second Sex, there were never any discussions in France about female existentialism, and women never had any complaint about the laws of society
 parantu bauaar ne vichaar dharaa badal daali
 Their female and male caste equality in society draws attention to two issues: One, how physical abnormalities have caused men to rise above and beyond women
 doosraa yah ki kis tarah shaareerik asaamanyataon par bahes va soch-vichaar karne se yah pataa chalata he ki shaareerik asaamanyata asal main prakruti kii kriya he or isamen purusho kaa koi haath nahin
 Therefore, the reason for the physical abnormality causing social inequality in men and women is meaningless and foolish
 yahan beovoir plato ke vichaar dharaa ko nakaarte hue kahati he ki kisi vyakti kaa ling ek ghatana he jisapar us vyakti kaa koi jor nahin hota hai
 Therefore, no distinction should be made between men and women
 nari astitv ke liye beovoir ne kai yogadan kiye hai, parantu phir bhi kabhi beovoir ne swayan ko ek kattar stri adhikaaravaadi nahin kaha
 But Beauvoir did not declare herself a feminist rightist in 1972 after the 1960s and 1970s feminist fronts

 The average diameter of Thalassa is 82 km and its shape is bumpy

 Scientists speculate that this moon of Varuna was not created side by side with Varun, but rather is formed from some mass of debris when Varun passes by and takes Triton under the hold of his powerful gravity and makes it his satellite

 In a statistical investigation, the researcher's interest usually lies in the study of individuals belonging to a group, with respect to one or more characteristics
 adhyayan ke tahat vyaktiyon ke is samooh ko aabaadi kaha jaataa he
 Population can be finite or infinite
 yah spasht he ki kisi bhi sankhyikeey jaanch ke liye puri jansankhya kaa ganan asambhav he
 For example, if we want to make an estimate of the average per capita income of India, then we have to calculate all the earning people of the country, which is impossible
 ek badi aabaadi yaa ek samooh se pratinidhi pratidarsh ko praapt karne kii vidhi ko pratichayan kaha jaataa he
 The method of sampling depends on the type of analysis
 pratinidhi pratidarsh ke ikaayiyon kii kul sankhya ko pratidarsh samshti kaha jaataa he
 The sample should represent the entire population
 jab ek badi aabaadi se pratidarsh chunaa jaataa he, yah vichaar karnaa aavashyak he ki kis prakaar yah chunaav kiya ja rahaa he
 To obtain a representative sample, the sample must be selected randomly
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vishvavidhyalay ke chaatro kii ausat umr kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye, 10% chaatro kaa pratichayan, lottery pranali kaa istemaal karke kiya ja saktaa he
 This will provide a fair representation of the students' abadi and give an approximate figure of the average age of the students
 soddeshy pratichayan In the objective sampling, the sample is selected with a definite objective in mind
 udhaaharan ke liye, agar ham nai dilli shahar main rehane vaale logon ke jivan str ki ek tasviir dena chaahe, to ham bhavy avan aaleeshaan mohallon main rehane vaale logon ko hi apane pratidarsh main shaamil karenge, or kam aay avan madhyam vargeey mohallon ko nazarandaaz karenge
 The drawback of this sampling method is that it is biased and does not yield a representative model of the entire population
 saral yadrichhik pratichayan Some important facts of simple random sampling: saral yadrichhik pratidarsh praapt karne ke kai tareeke hai
 There is a lottery system
 duusare prakriya main aabaadi ke prayek 'k' sadasyon ko ek adwitiya sankhya diya jaataa he
 All the numbers are put in a basket and mixed well
 phir, ek andhaa muda shodhakarta 'kha' sankhyaon kaa chayan karata he
 Members of the selected population are included in the sample
 stareekrut pratichayan In stratified sampling, the population is divided into groups based on certain characteristics
 phir, prayek samooh ke bheetar, ek sambhaavna pratidarsh kaa chayan kiya jaataa he
 In stratified sampling, groups are called strata
 ek udhaaharan ke rup main, maan lijie ham ek rashtriya surveykshan kaa aayojan karte he
 We divide the population into groups based on geography - North, East, South and West
 phir, prayek samooh ke bheetar, ham yadrichhik dhang se pratidarsh kaa chayan kar sakate he
 Systematic random sampling vyavasthit yadrichhik pratichayan main, ham aabaadi ke har sadsy kii ek suchi banaate he
 From the list, we randomly select the first units of the population list
 iske baad, ham suchi se har prayek k tatv kaa chayan karte he
 The selection of a sample with elements of each k is not equal, which is why systematic random sampling is different from random sampling
 achche data sangrah ke nimnlikhit gun he : Sampling enables the researcher to select the correct sample macro from the entire population
 udhaaharan ke liye, pratidin 600 million twit kaa utpaadan hota he
 But is it necessary to read all those tweets to determine the topic of the day? Or is it necessary that all the intentions should be given attention to reveal a general idea on any one subject? a general idea that it is not necessary to see all the data to make a prediction, only one model may be sufficient for this
 twitor data ke pratichayan ke liye ek saidhantik sutrikaran viksit kiya gaya he
 Sampling theory was not invented suddenly, but it has been developed in continuity with other statistical methods
 aadhunik kaal main pratichayan siddhant sankhyikeey vigyaan kaa ek alag, sayaanaa shakha ban gaya he kintu shuruuaati daur main aisa nahin tha
 The roots of sampling surveys are more rooted in government and social statistics than probability theory and experimental design
 praarambhik daur main raajnneetik ganit, or baad main saamaajik pathari, mahatvapurn gatividhiyon rahi, jinke kaaran ant main aadhunik pratichayan siddhant kaa janm hua
 However, sampling theory has been considered an actual branch of statistical science after probability theory became an inherent component of sampling theory

 The function of keeping food in a refrigerant is by changing the physical condition of a refrigerant medium

 automatic refrigerators, one on the principle of compression and the other on the principle of absorption
 in donon kii hi sanvrutt pranaaliyon main prasheetak-madhyam parivahan karata rahata he
 When the refrigerant-liquid filled in the evaporator inside them forms a gas, the heat of the food is absorbed and condensed into a condensate coil, which is always in contact with the air, and becomes liquid again
 inamen ek tapasthapi naame upkaran bhi laga rahata he, jiske dwaara khadyakaksh ke taap par niyantran rakhaa ja saktaa he
 In refrigeration devices operating on the principle of compression, or a motor of horsepower is employed to initiate the device's mechanism, by which condensation from a gaseous refrigerant-medium vaporizer such as sulfur dioxide or dichlorhydrofluor methane is induced into the coil

 These valves are also of two types
 ek to prasarak kapaat, jiske dwaara sanghanit prasheetak ek baarik phuhaare ke rup main bikharakar vaashpitra main pravisht hota he or jisase uskaa ekadam hi, aanshik rup main, vaashp ban jaataa he
 The second type is the plasma valve, which performs its work when a large amount of refrigerant-fluid is collected inside the evaporator and only then the action cycle is repeated
 avasorana ke siddhant par chalanevaale prashithitron main ammonia gas thande pani main saralata se ghul jaati he or pani ke garam hone par saralata se nikal bhi jaati he
 Therefore, a flame of oil or gas is used to heat water
 pani se alag hone par ammonia gas saghanan kundaliyon main jaakar dravit ho vaashpitra main bah aati he, jahaan hydrogen ke madhyam se sanghnitr kii daab itani kam ho jaati he ki vah drav phir se vashpit hone lagata he
 Then, as soon as the mixture of hydrogen and ammonia gas from the evaporator reaches the absorber cell, a fine spray of water is found in it
 isse ammonia gas to pani main ghul jaati he tathaa pani main aviley hydrogen vaashpitra main waapas laut jaataa he
 Here, the ammonium hydroxide enters the evaporator and restores the action cycle
 is prakaar ke yantra main garmi or thandak kaa aadan pradaan nirantar hote rahane ke kaaran isaki banaavat to badi hi pechida ho jaati he, lekin yantra kii kaaryakshmata acchhee rahati he

 a quantity will be studied as an exponential decay if the amount is decreasing proportional to its current value, ie the rate of decreasing its value is proportional to its current value
 ganitiya rup main uparokt kathan ko nimna avakal sameekaran dwaara vyakt kiya ja saktaa he, jahaan n maatra he or λ ek dhanatmak sankhya he jise kshay niyatank kehete hai: The solution to the above equation is: Rate of exponential change yahan n samay t par maatra he or N0 = n iskaa t=0 par arthath praarambhik maan he
 If the amount of decayed element n in a body at time t is the number of elements separated in a certain set, then it is possible to calculate the mean value of the time in which the element resides in the set
 is samay ko madhya aayu kaha jaataa he, ise τ se nirupit kiya jaataa he or yah pradarshit kiya ja saktaa he ki yah kshay dar λ, se nimna prakaar sambandh hoti he: The mean age is also seen as "unit time", because we can also write the exponential decay rate equation by the mean age, τ, instead of the decay constant λ: yahan ham dekh sakate hai ki τ vah samay he jab raashi kii kul maatra 1 / e = 0
367879441 tak kam ho jaati he
 For example, if the initial value is n = 1000 then at time τ, its value will be n = 368
 ek isi tarah kii raashi tab praapt hoti he jab aadhaar e ke sthaan par 2 liya jaataa he
 In that case it is called "half-age"
 ardhayu kaal, kshay hote hue kisi tatva kaa wo kaal hota he; jisamen wo tatva mul maatra se aadha ho jaye
 It is called the half-age of that element and is denoted by the symbol t1 / 2
 ardh-aayu ko madhya aayu athwa kshay niyatank ke vyanjakon ke rup main likhaa ja saktaa he: Writing the equation based on 2: atah padaarth kii 2−1 = 1 / 2 maatra shesh rahati he
 Hence the mean age τ { \ displaystyle \ tau} is obtained by dividing the half-age by a natural logarithm of 2, ie: udhaaharan ke liye polonium-210 kii ardh-aayu 138 din he or isaki madhya aayu 200 din he
 The equation that represents the exponential decay is written as follows yaa, punarvinyasit karne par, On inclusion jahaan c samakalan niyatank he atah Where the last substitution, N0 = ec, is obtained by t = 0 in the equation, N0 is the amount of substance at t = 0

 vasant panchami par unka janmdin manaane kii parampara 1930 main prarambh hui
 He was born on Tuesday
 janm-kundalee banane vaale pandit ke kehane se unka naam surjakumaar rakhaa gaya
 His father Pandit Ramshay Tiwari was a resident of Unnao and worked as a soldier in Mahishadal
 ve mul rup se uttar pradesh ke unnav jile ke gadhacola naamak gaanv ke nivasee the
 Nirala was educated up to high school
 baad main hindi sanskrit or bangla kaa swatantra adhyayan kiya
 In the beginning, Nirala got acquainted with the inconveniences and humiliation of his father's small job
 unhone dalit-shoshit kisaan ke saath hamadardi kaa sanskaar apane abodh man se hi arjeet kiya
 The mother died at the age of three and by the age of twenty, the father died
 apane bacchon ke alaava sanyukt parivaar kaa bhi boj niraala par padaa
 In the epidemic that spread after the first world war, not only wife Manohara Devi, but also uncle, brother and sister-in-law died
 shesh kunbe kaa boj uthaane main mahishadal kii naukari aparyaapt thi
 All his life after this was spent in financial struggle
 niraala ke jivan kii sabase vishesh baat yah he ki kathin se kathin paristhitiyon main bhi unhone siddhant tyagkar samjhaute kaa rasta nahin apanaaya, sangharsh kaa saahas nahin ganvaaya
 The latter part of life was spent in Allahabad
 vahiin daraganj muhalle main sthit raysahab kii vishaal kothi ke thik peeche bane ek kamare main 15 oktober 1961 ko unhone apni igalila samaapt kii
 The first appointment of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' took place in the Mahishadal state itself
 unhone 1918 se 1922 tak yah naukari kii
 He then moved to editing, independent writing and translation work
 1922 se 1923 ke dauraan kolkata se prakashit 'samanvay' kaa sampadan kiya, 1923 ke agast se matvaala ke sampadak mandal main kaary kiya
 He was then appointed to the Ganga Book Mala office in Lucknow, where he remained associated with the institution's monthly magazine Sudha till mid-1935
 1935 se 1940 tak kaa kuch samay unhone lakhanu main bhi bitaayaa
 After this, he lived in Allahabad till 1942 and did independent writing and translation work
 unki pehali kavita janmabhumi prabhaa naamak masik patr main june 1920 main, pehla kavita sangrah 1923 main anamika naam se, tathaa pehla niabandh bang bhashaa kaa uccharan oktober 1920 main masik patrika saraswati main prakashit hua
 Unlike other poets of his contemporary, he has taken little recourse to imagination in poetry and has portrayed reality prominently
 ve hindi main muktchand ke pravartak bhi maane jate hai
 In the role of his poetry collection Parimal published in 1930, he writes - niraala ne 1920 i0 ke aasapaas se lekhan kaary aarambh kiya
 His first composition was a song written on 'janmabhoomi'
 lambey samay tak niraala kii pratham rachana ke rup main prasiddh 'juhi kii kali' sheershak kavita, jiskaa rachanakaal niraala ne swayan 1916 i0 batalaaya tha, vastutah 1921 i0 ke aasapaas likhi gayi thi tathaa 1922 i0 main pehali baar prakashit hui thi
 Apart from poetry, Nirala has written in a tremendous amount in other genres of narrative and prose
 niraala rachanawali naam se 8 khandon main purv prakashit evam aprakashit sampoorn rachanaaon kaa suniyojit prakaashan The greatest feature of Suryakant Tripathi 'nirala' poetry is the skill of illustration
 aantarik bhav ho yaa bahya jagat ke drishy-rup, sangitatmak dhvaniyaan ho yaa rang or gandh, sajiv charitra hon yaa prakritik drishy, sabhi alag-alag laganevaale tattvon ko ghulaa-milakar niraala aisa jeevant chitra upasthit karte hai ki padhane vaala un chitron ke madhyam se hi niraala ke marm tak pahunch saktaa he
 Nirala's paintings not only contain her emotion, but also her thinking
 isliye unki bahut-si kavitaaon main darshanik gaharaai utpann ho jaati he
 Due to this new illustration skill and philosophical depth, often Nirala's poems become somewhat complicated, which the thinkers accuse them of rigor etc
 as they do not understand
 unke kisaan-bodh ne hi unhen chhayavaad kii bhoomi se aage badhkar yatharthwaad kii nai bhoomi nirmit karne kii prerana di
 Seeing special situations, characters and scenes, recognizing their heart and making those specific objects the subject of illustration is a notable feature of Nirala's realism
 niraala par aadhyatmavaad or rahasyavaad jaisi jivan-vimukh pravritiyon kaa bhi asar he
 Due to this effect, they often dream of conquering miracles and ending conflicts
 niraala kii shakti yah he ki ve chamatkaar ke bharose akarmanya nahin baith jate or sangharsh kii vaastavik chunauti se ankhen nahin churaate
 In some cases, mysticism goes against the unique real life experiences
 har ore prakaash failaa he, jivan alokamay mahaasaagar main dub gaya he, ityadi aisi hi baaten hai
 But this mysticism is not permanent in the sense of the infrequent, it proves to be fleeting
 anek baar niraala shabdon, dhvaniyon aadi ko lekar khilwaad karte hai
 It is difficult to call these players art
 lekin saamanyat: ve in khilvaadon ke madhyam se bade chamatkaarpurn kalatmak prayog karte hai
 The specialty of these experiments is that they are helpful in expressing the subject or emotion more effectively
 niraala ke prayogon main ek vishesh prakaar ke saahas or sajagata ke darshan hote hai
 It is this courage and awareness that makes Nirala different and special among poets of his era

 Similarly, the adjective terms karau, gorau, savanrau etc
 are immediate

 Mahabharata Gallery is a gallery built in Kurukshetra
 mahabharat bhartiya itihaas main evam vishwa main ladaa gaya sabase bada yuddh tha
 Its description is found in the texts and articles, but now the Mahabharata Gallery is being constructed in Kurukshetra, Haryana, where there will be pictures, texts, exhibitions, museums, films etc
 related to the Mahabharata
 ye ddeergha mahabharat se judi anya jigyaasaaon ko shant karegi
 The director of this gallery and museum is Archaeologist Rajesh Purohit
 unke anusaar yah ddeergha mahabharat ke aarambh or mahabharat granth ke janm jaise anek rahasyon se pardaa uthaaegi
 The responsibility of building the gallery is Kaleidoscope Entertainment Pvt
 Ltd
 Has received is gailaree ke saath yahaan gita gailaree bhi hogi, jisamen krishna-arjuna sanvaadon ko suna ja sakegaa
 The magnificent form of Lord Krishna in the gallery will be special for the audience
 agyatavaas kaa bhi jeevant drishy pradarshit kiya jayega
 Along with this, it will also be known that on how large a scale the war of Mahabharata was fought, what kind of weapons were used in it? jeev-vigyaan main pratirupan, anuvaanshik rup se samaan praaniyon kii jansankhya utpann karne kii prakriya he, jo prakruti main vibhinn jeevon, jaise bacteria, keet yaa paudhon dwaara alangik rup se prajnan karne par ghatit hoti he
 In biotechnology, modeling is the process of replicating DNA segments, cells or organisms
 yah shabd kisi utpaada, jaise digital madhyam yaa software kii anek pratiyaan nirmit karne kii prakriya ko bhi suchit karata he
 The word clone is derived from κλών, a Greek word for "stem, branch", denoting the process by which a new plant can be produced from a branch
 udhyaniki main beesvin sadi tak clon vartanee kaa prayog kiya jaataa tha; antim e kaa prayog yah bataane ke liye shuru hua ki yah swar ek "sankshipt o" nahin, valki ek "deergh o" he
 Since the word entered the popular dictionary with a more general reference, the spelling clone is used uniquely
 anvik pratirupan ek paribhaashit diene kram kii anek pratilipiyaan banane kii prakriya ko sanderbhit karata he
 Modeling is often used to amplify entire dna-containing DNA fragments, but can be used to amplify any DNA sequence, such as promoter, non-coding sequence, and randomly fragmented DNA
 genetic fingerprinting se lekar bade paimaane par protein ke utpaadan tak, jaivik prayogon va vyaavhaarik anuprayogon kii ek vyapak shrinkhalaa main iskaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes the term impersonation is misleading to describe the chromosomal status of a gene associated with a specific phenotype, as in positional modeling
 vyavhaar main, ek gunasutra yaa jinomik kshetra main kisi jin kaa sthaniyakaran karnaa aavashyak rup se kisi vishisht praasangik jinomik kram ko alag karne yaa ise sanvardhit karne kii kshamta pradaan nahin karata
 kisi sajiv praani main kisi bhi diene kram ko sanvardhit karne ke liye, vah kram anivaary rup se pratikruti ke mul se joda janaa chaiye, jo ki swayan ko va isse jude kisi bhi kram ke sancharan ko nirdeshit karne kii kshamta rakhanevaala ek diene kram hota he
 However, a number of other features are required and a variety of specialized modeling vectors are available, allowing for the expression of protein expression, tagging, single-stranded RNA and DNA production, and other modifications
 kisi diene khand ke pratirupan main aavashyak rup se chaar charan sammilit hote hai Although these steps are similar in different modeling methods, several alternative routes can be selected, summarized as "impersonation strategies"
 prarambh main, hamaari ruchi ke diene ko alag karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, taaki upyukt aakaar kaa diene khand pradaan kiya ja sake
 iske baad, baandhne kii vidhi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jisamen is pravardhit khand ko ek vector main pravisht kiya jaataa he
 This vector is straightened using a restriction enzyme and incubated under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called DNA ligase with our segment of interest
 baandhne ke baad, hamaari ruchi kii pravishti se yukt vector ko koshikaon main transfect kiya jaataa he
 Several alternative techniques, such as chemical sensitization, electroporation, optical injection and biolistics of cells, are available
 ant main, transfect kii gai in koshikaon ko pravardhit kiya jaataa he
 As the efficiency of the methods described above is typically low, it is necessary to identify cells that have been successfully transfected with a vector construct with the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation
 aadhunik pratirupan vectors main chayan-yogya pratijaivik pratirodh chinhak shaamil hote hai, jo keval un koshikaon ke parivardhan kii anumati dete hai, jinamein vector transfect kiya ja chukaa ho
 iske atirikt, pratirupan vectors main rang-chayan chinhak bhi ho sakate hai, jo X-gal madhyam par neeli / safed screening pradaan karte hai
 However, selection of these steps does not fully guarantee that DNA entry is present in the cells obtained
 parinamit bastiyon kaa aage or nirikshan karnaa anivaary hota he, taaki is baat kii pushti kii ja sake ki pratirupan safal hua tha
 This can be done by PCR, restriction block analysis and / or DNA sequencing
 ek koshika ke pratirupan kaa arth he kisi ekal koshika se koshikaon kii jansankhya praapt karnaa
 ekkosiya jeevon, jaise bacteria or khamir main, yah prakriya lakshaneey rup se saral hoti he or tatvatah isamen keval upyukt madhyam kaa sanchaaran aavashyak hota he
 However, in the case of additions derived from multicellular organisms, impersonating cells is a difficult task as these cells will not grow easily in standard medium
 koshika-panktiyon kii ek bhinn vanshavali ke pratirupan ke liye prayukt ek upyogi utak sanvardhan takanic main pratirupan chakron kaa prayog shaamil hota he
 According to this technique, single-cell delay of cells exposed by a mutagenic medium or drug used to conduct selection is maintained at high dilution to form isolated settlements; Each of which originates from a single and possibly clone-form distinct cell
 ek praarambhik vikaas charan main, jab bastiyon main bahut-thodi koshikaayen hoti hai, greece main duboe gaye roganuhin polistirin chakron ko kisi ekal basti par rakhaa jaataa he or inamen thodaa tripsin milaayaa jaataa he
 The replicated cells are stored from the inner part of the cycle and transferred to a new vessel for future development
 daihik koshika parmaanu hastantaran, jise SCNT ke rup main janaa jaataa he, kaa prayog bhi shodh yaa chikitsakeey prayojanon ke liye bhrun nirmit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 Its most likely purpose is to produce embryos for use in stem cell research
 is prakriya ko "anusandhan pratirupan" yaa "upachaaratmak pratirupan" kehete hai
 Its goal is not to create replicated humans, but to create stem cells that can be used to study human development and to treat potential diseases
 While the replicate human blastocyst has been constructed, the original cell lines have yet to be isolated from the replication source
 jeev pratirupran ek nae bahukoshiya jeev ke nirmaan kii vidhi ko ullekith karata he, jo genetic rup se kisi anya jeev ke samaan hota he
 In short, this form of modeling is an asexual method of reproduction, with no fertilization or endogenous contact
 Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring method found in many species, including most flora and some pests
 vaigyanikon ne pratirupan ke saath kuch badi uplabdhiyaan hasil kii hai, jinamein bhedon or gaayon kaa alangik prajnan shaamil he
 There is a lot of ethical debate on whether impersonation should be used
 Although impersonation, or asexual reproduction, has been practiced in the horticultural world for hundreds of years
 udhyaniki main praturup shabd kaa prayog ek paudhe ke un sabhi vanshajon kaa ullekh karne ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo vanaspatik prajnan yaa apomixis se utpann hue hon
 udhyaniki paudhon kii anek prajatiyaan praturup hai, jo kisi ek paudhe se praapt kii gai thim or langik prajnan ke alaava kisi anya prakriya ke dwaara unki sankhya main vruddhi kii gai he
 As an example, some European species of grapes represent models that have been produced for over two millennia
 anya udhaaharan aalu or kelaa hai
 The act of planting a pen can be considered an impersonation because all the shoots and branches coming from the pen are usually replicas of the same plant, but this particular type of impersonation has not come under ethical testing and is usually accompanied by a completely different function
 Is treated as

 Portions of a large model colony often break away from their parent and develop into a separate entity, called fission
 kuch paudhe, udaa
 dandelion, alangik rup se bijon kaa nirmaan bhi karte hai, jise apomixis kaha jaataa he
 Naturally, some species of animals have a genetic derivative, known as nonadaptation
 yah ek alangik prakaar kaa prajnan he, jo keval kuch maadaa keedon, kade kavach vaale praaniyon or chhipakaliyon main paaya jaataa he
 Growth and development occurs without fertilization by the male
 vanaspatiyon main, anishekajanan kaa arth he ek anishechit ande kii koshika se ek bhrun kaa vikaas or yah apomixis kii ek ghatak prakriya he
 In species using the XY system of sex determination, the offspring will always be female
 An example of this is the "small red ant", originally native to Central and South America, but has spread to most equatorial environments
 jeevon ke kritrim pratirupan ko prajananeey pratirupan bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 Reproducible modeling usually uses "somatic cell nuclear transfer" to create genetically integrated animals
 is prakriya main ek daata vayask koshika se kisi nabhik-viheen ande main nabhik kaa sthanantaran karnaa shaamil hota he
 If the egg divides normally, it is transferred to the uterus of the representative mother
 is prakaar ke praturup purnatah samroop nahin hote kyonki daihik koshika ke nabhik diene main kuch parivartan ho sakate hai
 Additionally, mitochondria in the cytoplasm may also contain DNA, and during SCNT, this DNA is derived entirely from the donor egg, so its mitochondrial genome is not identical to the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced
 yah antahprajateey nabhik sthanantaran ke liye mahatvapurn prabhaav lagu kar saktaa he, jisamen nabhik-mitocondrial asangattaaon ke parinamswaroop maut ho sakati he
 Artificial embryo division or method of making pairs of embryos can also be used as a method of modeling, in which mature embryos are divided before embryo transfer
 yah ishtatam rup se 6-se-8-koshika charan main kiya jaataa he, jahaan iskaa prayog uplabdh bhrunon kii sankhya ko badhaane ke liye IVF ke vistaaran ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 If both embryos are successful, it gives rise to monozygotic twins
 doli, ek fin dorset bhed, ek vayask andey se safaltaapurvak pratirupit kii gai pehali stanpayi thi, haalanki pratirupit kiya gaya pehla merudandiya praani ek mendhak tha, jise 1952 main pratirupit kiya gaya tha
 She was impersonated at the Rosslyn Institute in Scotland and lived there until her death at the age of six
 On 2003-04-09, its relics were kept in the Royal Museum of Edinburgh, a part of the National Museums of Scotland
 doli saarvajanik rup se mahatvapurn thi kyonki is prayaas ne yah dikhaa diya ki kisi vishisht vayask koshika se liye gaye genetic padaarth, jo ki apane jeens ke keval ek vishisht up-samucchy ko vyakt karne ke liye yojanabaddh rup se viksit kiya gaya ho, ko ek sampurna praani ke rup main viksit hone ke liye punah yojanabaddh kiya ja saktaa he
 Prior to this demonstration, there was no evidence for the widely prevalent hypothesis that any isolated organism could give birth to a whole new organism
 doli bhed ke pratirupan main prati nishechit ande kii safalataa dar kam thi; uskaa janm 29 bhrunon ke vikaas ke liye 237 andon ke prayog ke baad hua, jinhone keval teen memanon ko janm diya or unamem se keval ek jivit rahaa

 vishesh rup se, haalanki sabase pehle pratirupit jeev mendhak the, lekin abhi tak koi bhi mendhak daihik vayask nabhik daata koshika se utpann nahin kiya gaya he
 Initially claims were made that Dolly the sheep had rapid aging-like symptoms
 vaigyanikon ne anumaan lagaaya ki 2003 main doli kii maut rekhiy gunasutron ko samaapti se bachaane vaale diene-protein samoohon, telomir kii kami se sambandhit thi
 However other researchers, including Ian Wilmut, who led the team successfully replicating Dolly, argue that Dolly's death at a young age due to respiratory infections had nothing to do with the shortcomings of the impersonation process
 nabhik sthanantaran ko shaamil karanevaali aadhunik pratirupan takneekon kaa prayog vibhinn prajatiyon par safaltaapurvak kiya ja chukaa he
 Notable experiments in chronological order are as follows: kisi jivit athwa purv main jivit maanav kii genetic rup se samaan pratilipi kaa nirmaan karnaa maanav pratirupan kehalaata he
 The term is commonly referred to as artificial human modeling; Human motifs are commonly found in the form of identical twins, in which impersonation occurs during the natural process of reproduction
 maanav pratirupan ke do prakaaron kii aksar charchaa kii jaati he: upachaaratmak pratirupan or prajananeey pratirupan
 upachaaratmak pratirupan main chikitsa main istemaal ke liye vayask koshikaon kaa pratirupan karnaa shaamil he or yah anusandhan kaa ek sakriy kshetra he
 Breeding modeling will involve the creation of replicated humans
 a third type of modeling, called substitution modeling, is a theoretical possibility and will be a combination of therapeutic and reproducible modeling
 Replacement modeling would involve replacement of a highly damaged, failed or weak body by impersonation, followed by a full or partial brain transplant
 maanav pratirupan ke vibhinn rup vivaadaaspad hai
 The demand to stop all the progress in the field of human modeling has arisen many times
 adhikansh vaigyanik, shaskeey va dharmik sanghathan prajananeey pratirupan kaa virodh karte hai
 The American Association for the Advancement of Science and other scientific organizations have suggested through public statements that reproducible impersonations should be banned until security-related issues are resolved
 Serious ethical concerns have been presented regarding the future possibility of organ production from modeling

 It is not clear whether the embryo produced could have been capable of further development, but Dr
 Wood stated that if it had been possible, the use of this technology for reproductive modeling would have been both unethical and illegal
 In La Jolla, 5 replicated embryos manufactured at the Stamagen Corporation Lab were destroyed

 Vaishyas have also been called 'dwij'
