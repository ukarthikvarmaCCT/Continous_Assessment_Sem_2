 subhashit aise shabd-samooh, vaakya yaa anuchhedon ko kehete hai jisamen koi baat sundar dhang se yaa budhimattapurna tareeke se kahi gayi ho
 The words Subhash, Gnome, Precious words, etc
 are also used for this
 jaise- The following definition of Subhashit is given in Harshacharit- prithvi par jal, ann or subhashit - ye teen ratna he
 Foolish people identify stone pieces with the noun "gems"! bhavarth : subhashit kathan rupi sampada kaa jo sangrah nahin karata vah prasangvishesh kii charchaa ke yajna main bhala kya dakshina degaa ? samuchit vaartalap main bhaag lenaa ek yajna he or us yajna main ham dusron ke prati subhashit shabdon kii aahuti de sakate hai
 On such an occasion, sweet words are expected from a person, but one who has not earned the wealth of good words, that is, if he has not adapted his nature, what can he give to others on such occasions? bhavarth : sansar rupi kaduve ped se amrit tulya do hi fal uplabdh ho sakate hai, ek he mithe bolon kaa rasaswadan or doosraa he sajjanon kii sangati
 This world is a repository of sufferings, face to face frustrating situations

 Gorkha Regiment Since India's independence in 1947, six Gorkha regiments, first part of the British Indian Army, became part of the Indian Army and have served ever since, according to the uk-india-nepal tripartite agreement

 The seventh Gorkha Rifles Regiment was again raised in the Indian Army after independence to accommodate the Gorkha soldiers of the 7th Gorkha Rifles and 10th Gorkha Rifles, who decided not to move the British Army

 The soldiers are mainly Nepal's ethnic Nepali Gorkhas and ethnic people of Nepal known as the Indian Gorkhas, have a history of courage in battle, before the gallantry awards won by Gorkha soldiers and the war honors awarded to Gorkhas and Later Indian Army

 When India became a republic in 1950, the title "royal" was removed under the name of 5 Gorkha Rifles
 gorkha regiment ke vibhaajan ke baad, british sena ne faisla liya ki british sena main shaamil hona gorkha sainikon ke liye puri tarah se svaichhik hoga or ek janamat sangrah karne kaa faisla kiya
 As a result, a large number of 7th Gorkha Rifles and 10th Gorkha Rifles, recruited mainly from eastern Nepal, decided not to join their regiment as a part of the British Army
 nepal ke is kshetra se ek dal ko banaae rakhane ke liye, bhartiya sena ne 11 gorkha rifles badhaane kaa faisla kiya
 Although a regiment raised during World War 1 with troops drawn from various Gorkha units, this regiment was disbanded in 1922 and most of the current 11 Gorkha Rifles, mostly soldiers and emblems of their respective regiments
 It has nothing to do with it, although some claim so

 It seems that Swami Vivekananda had immense reverence and love for Baba
 Baba never used to preach because he felt as if he was higher than others, but if the source of the heart was opened, then the flow of his infinite knowledge flowed
 apane antim samay main unhone logo se milanaa-julna kaam kar diya tha
 1 Others have no problem because of them, so they themselves performed their cremation

 The Shiromani Akali Dal is a major regional political party in Punjab, India
 prakaash singh badal ke netritv sukhbir singh badal iske vartmaan adhyaksh hai
 Giving a political voice to Sikhs in the world is the main objective of this party
 taraazoo iskaa chunaav chihn he
 Akali Dal akali dal kaa gathan disambar 1920 ko 14 shiromani gurudwara prabandhak cameti, sikh dharmik sharir ke ek kaary bal ke rup main kiya gaya tha
 The Akali Dal considers itself the principal representative of the Sikhs
 sardaar sarmukh singh chubbal ekikrut akali dal ke pehle adhyaksh the, lekin isane master tara singh ke netritv main adhik lokapriyata praapt kii
 Master Tara Singh was a staunch Sikh leader
 unhone angrej sarkaar kii sahaayta se sikhpanth ko brihat hindu samaaj se pruthak karne ke sardaar ujjvalasinh majithia ke prayaas main har sambhav yoga diya
 The party started the Punjabi Suba movement, led by Sant Fateh Singh, demanding a state with a majority of Punjabis from undivided eastern Punjab
 sarkaar ko prasann karne ke liye sena main adhikadhik sikhon ko bhartee hone ke liye prerit kiya
 Due to them, Sikhs were also given separate communal representation like Muslims in India Act 1919
 mahayuddh ke baad master ji ne sikh raajnneeti ko congress ke saath sambhddha kiya or sikh gurudwaron or dharmik sthalon kaa prabandh hindu mathadhishon or hindu pujaariyon ke haath se chhinakar unpar adhikaar kar liya
 This led to an unprecedented increase in the strength of the Akali Dal
 master tarasingh shiromani gurudwara prabandh cameti ke pratham mahaamantri chune gaye
 The placement of the glands came into his hands
 inaki sahaayta se akaliyon kaa antkapurna prabhaav sampurna punjab main chaa gaya
 Master Tara Singh later was elected President of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee several times
 master tarasingh ne san 1921 ke savinay avagya andolan main sakriy rup se bhaag liya, par san 1928 kii bhartiya sudhaaron sambandhi neh degree cameti kii report kaa is aadhaar par virodh kiya ki usamen punjab vidhansabha main sikhon ko 30 pratishat pratinidhitiv nahin diya gaya tha
 Then the Akali Dal severed its ties with the Congress
 1930 main purna swarajya kaa sangram prarambh hone par master tarasingh tatasth rahe or inke dal ne dwitiya mahayuddh main angrejon kii sahaayta kii
 The "pathik" party organized by Master Tara Singh in 1946's General Assembly won 20 out of the 33 seats assigned to the Sikhs in the assembly of the united Punjab
 master ji ne sikhistan kii sthapana ke apane lakshya kii purti ke liye jinna se samjhauta kiya
 Assisted him in forming the League's cabinet in Punjab and finding the basis for the creation of Pakistan
 lekin raajnneeti ke chatur khilaadi jinna se bhi unhen niraashaa hi haath lagi
 After the announcement of partition of India, riots started in Amritsar under Master Tara Singh's plan to take advantage of the opportunity, but this attempt of Master Ji also failed
 master ji ne samvidhanparishad main sikhon ke sampradayik pratinidhitiv ko kaayam rakhane, bhashasuchi main gurumukhi lipi main punjab ko sthaan dene tathaa sikhon ko harijanon kii bhanti vishesh suvidhaayen dene par bal diya or sardaar patel se aashwaasan praapt karne main safal hue
 Thus the Constitutional Council also sealed the separate existence of Sikh sect and by providing special facilities to the Sikhs, opened the way for quick spread of Sikh sect by conversion of poor and Dalit Hindus
 tarasingh ise sikh rajya kii sthapana kaa aadhaar maanate the
 At the time of the election agreement with the Congress in the 1952 General Election, he was successful in making the decision of the creation of a separate Punjabi speaking state and the establishment of a Punjabi University by the Congress Working Committee
 master tarasingh ne vibhinn andolanon ke silsile main anek baar jailyatraayen kii, par dilli main yojit ek vishaal pradarshan kaa netritv karne se purv mukhyamantri sardaar pratapsingh kairon dwaara bandi banaaya janaa unke netritv ke hraas kaa kaaran bana
 In those days, the movement of independent Punjab under the leadership of Master Tara Singh was going on in full swing
 praant main ek prakaar kii araajaktaa machi hui thi
 Kairo faced the movement with his strong personality and political foresight, and his diplomacy succeeded in creating a split between the movement's main pillars, Master Tara Singh and Sant Fatah Singh, and the movement became disjointed
 kaid ho chuke tara singh ne apane sthaan par pradarshan kaa netritv karne ke liye apane anyatam sahyog sant fatehsingh ko manonith kiya
 The saint later started an indefinite fast for the Punjabi state in the absence of Master ji, to finish it, Master Tara Singh forced Sant Fatehsinh after his release from imprisonment and in response became the wrath of the Sikh community
 apni pratishtha ko banaae rakhane ke liye unhone swayan aamaran anshan prarambh kar diya, jise unhone kendriya sarkaar ke aashwaasan par hi tyaagaa
 The government invited the saint in place of the master ji
 ghatnakramon ne ab tak master ji ke netritv ko prabhaavaheen or sant ko vikhyath bana diya tha
 He got entangled at every turn and Sant Ji's popularity grew in the same proportion
 sardaar pratapsingh ke raajnneetik kaushal ne sikh raajnneetik shakti ke akshay strot shiromani gurudwara prabandh cameti se bhi master ko nishkasit karne main sant ko safal banaaya
 Master ji was defeated by Sant ji
 unke 45 varsh puraane netritv kaa ant ho gaya; yah unki raajnneetik mrityu thi
 In 1962, his party got only three seats in the assembly
 yadhyapi 1966 main hue punjab vibhaajan kii purvapithika taiyaar karne kaa sampurna shrey master tarasingh ko hi he
 In 1966, the present Punjab was formed
 tab akali dal nae punjab main satta main aayaa tha, lekin vahaan kii shuruaati sarkarein party ke bheetar aantarik sangharsh or satta sangharsh ke kaaran lambey samay tak satta main nahin raheen
 Later, the party was strengthened and the party governments were able to complete their term
 vartmaan raajnneetik sthiti In 2012, the Punjab government was formed by the Akali Dal in partnership with its regional and national ally Bharatiya Janata Party
 isamen sarkaar ke antargat punjab vidhansabha main iske 59 sadsy hai or 12 bhartiya janata party ke
 As such, it is a joint majority government
 2012 ke chunaavon main akali dal ko purna bahumat praapt hua
 Party mentor and former president Prakash Singh Badal became the Chief Minister of Punjab and party president Sukhbir Singh Badal became the Deputy Chief Minister
 2014 ke loksabhaa chunaavon main party ne loksabhaa main 4 sthanon par vijay praapt kii
 The main political rival of the Akali Dal in Punjab is the Indian National Congress

 He was an ikki, a first termer, bone-weary, but always gung-ho
 When we made it to the top, the first stop was for a fill of water
 Soggy, bushed and thirsty, we ran to the natural spring that has been feeding soldiers since the days of Chhatrapati Shivaji
 Unni was the first to reach and started drawing water from the well
 We lined up with our canteens, but a tourist first held out her water bottle
 Unni filled it
 Then, another
 Unni filled that too
 Within seconds, there was a long line of tourists waiting for water
 Without a word - and with a smile to us - Unni dutifully doled out his generosity
 He never got to us
 He himself never got a sip
 The order came to move on

 The monarchy of the Bahamas has the distinction of being the unitary sovereign sovereign of the Bahamas and a total of 15 subjects, including the United Kingdom
 vartmaan satta-vidyaman shaasha, 6 farvari varsh 1952 se maharani elizabeth dwitiya hai
 The political system of the Bahamas, like other Commonwealth countries, is based on the Westminster system, in which the position of head of state is nominal, and the real administrative powers are vested at the head of state
 bahamaz rashtramandal saidhantik rup se ek rajtantr he, or bahamaz ke shaasha ke padaadhikari iske rashtrapramukh hote hai, haalaanki shaasha kii sari sanvaidhanik shaktiyon kaa abhyaas, unke pratinidhi ke rup main, bahamaz ke governor-general karte hai

 jo purv upnivesh, british shaasha ko aaj bhi apana shaasha maanate he, un deshon ko rashtramandal prajabhumi yaa rashtramandal pradesh kaha jaataa he
 As the prominent parallel heads of many of these nations, the British academies also find themselves with the title of head of the Commonwealth

 At a Commonwealth meeting in 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that all Commonwealth territories had agreed to end the male preference tradition, and also to revoke future rulers from prohibiting Catholics from marrying Catholic individuals
 Everyone's approval was obtained

 Saraswati Kantabharan is an honorable treatise of Sanskrit-literature-literature discussing poetry, written by Maharaja Bhojraj of Dhareshwar
 maharaj bhojraj kaa samay isvi san 1010-1055 tak itihaaskaaron dwaara sweekrut kiya gaya he
 Therefore, the creation period of Saraswati Kantha Bharan can be considered to be mid-eleventh century AD
 iske praneta kavyprakash ke rachayita mammat se kinchit purvavarti hai
 Although the sound of doctrine was established by Anandavardhana, the recognition of sound as Kavyatma was disputed till that time; Therefore, neither Bhojdev nor Bhatt Mammat adopted the determination to give voice as a soul in the definition of poetry in a literal sense
 donon aacharyon ne kavy main doshabhaav tathaa gunvattta ko pradhanta di he
 It is the specialty of Bhojdev that he has accepted the utility of ornaments and has considered it necessary for poetry to be restored
 yon bhojdev ke saraswatikanthabharan ne anshat: mammat ko evam vishwanath ko prabhavit kiya he
 Saraswati Kantha Bharan is a long text containing five passages
 pratham pariched main rachayita ne kavyasaamanya kii paribhaasha dene ke pashchaat sarvapratham kavy ke deergh evam gun kaa vivechan kiya he
 In this context, Bhojdev has given verse, sentence and syntactic defects
 har prakaar ke dosha kii sankhya solah he
 According to Bhojdev, qualities, words and sentences are known and each has twenty-four distinctions
 pratham pariched ke ant main katipay dosha kahin kahin gun ban jate hai
 By illustrating this poetry, he has accepted the routine of poetry
 dwitiya pariched main shabdalankar kaa nirnay karte hue unhone sarvapratham auchiti par bal diya tathaa jati, reeti, vritti, chaaya, mudra, ukti, yukti, bhaniti, gunfna, shayya evam pathiti kaa sodaaharan vivechan kiya he
 Except for the custom of these twelve elements, detailed explanation of the remaining elements is not found in any other available literature in Sanskrit
 banbhatta ne kavyasaushthav ke vishesh tatv, shayya kaa ullekh kiya he parantu uski paribhaasha keval saraswatikanthabharan main hi uplabdh hoti he
 Thereafter, an example is given of the vulgar distinctions of puns, puns, alliteration, pictures, pralica, esoteric and q & As
 is ansh main bhi saraswatikanthabharan kii sarvatha nijee visheshta he
 Subsequently, Bhojdev, discussing the causes of poetry, presents three distinctions of poetry in the form of audio, visual and pictorial
 drishykavy ke antargat unhone dasharupakon kaa ullekh nahin kiya he varan nritt evam nrity par hi unka vibhaajan simit he
 In the third passage, there is a discussion of the difference between the form and the type of economists, which take different forms than other literatures
 chauthe pariched main ubhayalankaron kaa vivechan he jisamen upama aadi alankaaron ke bhedopabhedon ko savistaar samajhaayaa he
 The last passage is rasvivechan
 isamen naikadi kaa tathaa vibhaavon, bhaavon evam anubhaavon kaa vistaarpurvak swaroop nirnay kiya gaya he; saath hi saath kavypaak, vividh ratiraag ke swaroop kaa bhi nirdesh he
 At the end there is a epilogue with a discussion of vrittis like Bharati, Kaishiki etc
 saraswatikanthabharan main rassidhant kii vivechna praaia: vishay par ek vihangam drushtimaatr he
 Poetic poetry is a serious matter, with a view to doing justice to it with dignity, Bhoja completes the chapter of Rasavivechan by composing an independent book called Shringarprakash
 saraswatikanthabharan kii visheshta yah he ki yah itar sahityashastreey granthon kii apeksha vyapak evam vyutpaadak granth he
 Its creator Bhojdev is not going to be afraid of Granthavistar, he always makes a generous effort to explain many subtle differences and strains by giving examples
 yadhyapi unke dwaara upasthaapit bhedopabhedon kii manyata parvarti granthkaaron ne sweekrut nahin kii he tathaapi unke tathvik vivechan se sahasaa asahmat hone kii dridhtaa bhi kutraapi drushtigochar nahin hoti
 There is no creation of a commentary on this book

5, respectively, going two years after playing his first first-class match, when he hit his first first-class century when he hit 111 Played an unbeaten innings
 Subsequently, Strauss's reputation rose rapidly: in 2001, 2002 and 2003 he scored 1211 at an average of 45, 1202 at an average of 48, and 1529 at an average of 51

 Strauss got his first chance in international cricket on England's tour of the Indian subcontinent, but he mostly played only the twelfth player; Strauss, who considered himself better in the long-form of the game, was surprised when he was selected in the one-day squad

 As England reached Sri Lanka directly from Bangladesh, Strauss continued to pressurize England opener Vikram Solanki by scoring a top 83 against Solanki's five-ball zero in a tour match, and as a reward for England When he got a chance to play for the first time, he lost by ten wickets in that disappointing match, he was playing for the first time by Sri Lanka, Dinusha Fernando, He was caught and bowled out, after which he was kept out of the remaining matches of the tour
 strans ko west indies ke daure main ek or mauka diya gaya tha, yahaan tak ki mark buchar ke chotil hone ke kaaran unhen test team main bhi le liya gaya
 Even then he was only given a chance in the one-day team, but by playing third place apart from his original order, he made an impact by scoring the highest 29 runs in England's struggling win
 Despite this, he was kept out of the team until the fifth match after the second canceled match, in which he contributed just 10 runs, but he completed it by making the highest score jointly with captain Michael Vaughan and giving a good start, The match was eventually lost to England, with Styros taking a brilliant first international catch
 He helped level the series by winning the final match with his 66-run contribution

 The original plan was to promote Mark Butcher to the vacant opener at this time and include Paul Collingwood in the middle order
 Butcher refused to go up the order and played in the third order, which meant that Strauss was asked to start batting and Collingwood had to sit out of the team
 Vaughan's injury proved fortunate for Strauss, who contributed a supreme 112 in his first Test innings and scored 82 runs before being dismissed in the second innings, the responsibility of the run-out being accepted by Nasir Hussain

 australia ke viruddh twanti-20 antarrashtriya match main strans ko ballebaaji kram main ullekhneey rup se kaaphi naache khilaayaa gaya jisamen unhone england kii 100 ran se jeet main 18 ran banaae the or natwest ke haare hue match main kuch acha score kiya lekin ullekhneey nahin, do maichon main 50 ke aas paas hi rahe
 While entering the 2005 Ashes series, England had not won any of the series since 1980, while the series appeared to be entirely in Australia's favor, with an undisclosed record in the previous six series, by Australian captain Ricky Ponting
 The forecast was that it was going to be the closest match since England's last win
 kadaachit team lords main bhi dabaav ne strans tathaa shesh team ko prabhavit kiya tha, kyonki team ke 190 ke score main unhone 2 kaa yogadan diya or duusari pari main kuch behatar karte hue is haare hue match main team ke 180 main 37 ran banaae, haalanki strans ne pehali pari main panting kaa kaich jarur liya tha
 The second Test proved to be more dramatic, with Strauss making some improvements to his Lord's performance and bowling out Shane Warne for forty-eight for the first wicket partnership with Trescothick
 haalanki is thos shuruyaat ne england ko pehali pari main 99 ran kii badhat tak pahunchaa diya, ye duusari pari main strans ke tuchh chah ran the jisane adhik dhyaan khinchaa, duusare din kaa khel khatm hone se chaar gend pehle worne kii ek legbrake khurdare sthaan se ascharyajanak dhang se spin hui or unke sharir se takaraakar leg stump le udi
 ve chah ran yakeenan mahatvapurn hai kyonki, england kii jeet kaa antar tha maatr do ran
 is chah ke ank ne unka old trevord main hone vaale agle test main peechha kiya, won ke liye jagah banaakar jinhone is shrinkhalaa kaa pehla shatak lagaaya
 strans ne apane captain ke nakshekadam par chalate hue duusari pari main apni ore se 106 jode or australia ke liye 371 kaa lakshya nirdhaarit kiya jisane apana antim wicket na girane dekar drow surakshit kar liya or is shrinkhalaa ko 1-1 kii barabari par le aayaa
 In the fourth Test, Strauss helped give England a good start by scoring a century partnership for the first wicket, his own contribution of 35 runs and helping to restrict Australia to 218 with two catches, especially fast runs
 Adam Gilchrist was caught far away from the slip, which was called the "permanent image of summer"
 follow-on dene ke baad england ko 129 kaa lakshya mila or dabaav main ballebaaj out hone lage, strans teesraa wicket girane tak date rahe or bees se adhik kaa score banane vaale chaar ballebaajon main se ek rahakar test jita diya tathaa sharunkhlaa main badhat praapt karali
 ashes par kabja karne ke liye antim test main sirf drow kii hi jarurat thi, strans ne vijayi ravaiye ke saath pehle din lagbhag puure din ballebaaji kii jisamen unhone saat saajhedaariyaan nibhaain or 129 ran banaae or ashes main ek or shatak lagaakar donon tiimon main se shrinkhalaa main record do shatak banane vaale akele khilaadi ban gaye
 Strauss once again took a catch in the field and helped dismiss Australia's second best batsman and captain Ponting in the series, and at the same time sent pacer Glenn mcgrath back to zero
 jab shrinkhalaa main ek din se kuch hi upar shesh bachaa tha, to england ko dubaara ballebaaji kerani padi or durbhaagya se strans apane shandaar pradarshan ko kaayam nahin rakh sake, unhen phir se worne ne out kiya jab sirf ek ran par simon katich ne unka kaich lapak liya
 Despite all this, fellow South African-born England player Kevin Petersen stopped Australia from winning his maiden century and England captured the Ashes by winning the series for the first time in 18 years
 ek shrinkhalaa main yakeenan ballebaaji se gendbaaji adhik prabhavi rahi, strans ballebaaji ausat 39
30 rahaa jabaki ve 393 ran bana kar england ke sirf chauthe sarvaadhik ran banane vaale ballebaaj rahe, australia ke sirf ek ballebaaj justin langer ne unase adhik ran banaae the, wo bhi maatr ek ran; strans ek maatr khilaadi the jisane do shatak lagaae tathaa chah kaich pakad kar england ke hi ian bel ke baad duusare sarvshereshth kshetrarakshak rahe
 In the New Year's honors list, while captain Michael Vaughan and coach Duncan Fletcher were awarded the obes, Tim's members, including Strauss, were awarded the mbes
 agle sheetakaaleen maheenon main, england ne apni ashes kii safalataa ke baad 2004 se chah shrinkhalaaon ke avijit kram ko aage badhaane ke uddeshy se england ne pakistan kaa daura kiya
 Strauss started the tour discouraging by scoring five runs in practice matches twice and six once, scoring 56 runs in the final innings of the practice match
 strans kii ballebaaji kii samasyaon ko sweekaar karte hue, strans ke pradarshan main kabhi sudhaar nahin ho sakaa kyonki england kii antim haar se pehle, apane pehle bachche ke janm par shaamil hone ke liye pakistan chhodane se purv, pehle do teston, jinamein pehla haare or doosraa drow hua, main unhone 11 ke ausat se sirf 44 ran banaae
 Strauss returned for the one-day series but showed little improvement with only five runs in a tour match, but had more success sending balls to Thirdman, scoring the highest number of 94s in England's victory in the first match
 unhone kam score vaale antim match main bhi 26 ran banaae, jise england ne jeeta tha, lekin isse pehle do maichon main shunya kaa chashma bhi pahana tha
 After Christmas, England went to India in March and Strauss started batting with 21-year-old Alastair Cook, playing for the first time due to Trescothick's absence due to a stress-related disease
 cook ne strans ke aarambhik naatakeey pradarshan ko doharaaya jab unhone drow hue match main strans ke 28 or 36 ko feekaa karte hue ek ardhshtak tathaa ek shatak lagaaya
 tisare test main saamne cook ke bina strans ek baar phir se chamake or vijaydaayi prayaas main 128 ran bana kar shrinkhalaa baraabar kar lee
 If England could have drawn the series in the subsequent one-day matches, they would have considered themselves lucky, having lost four consecutive matches playing under Vaughan's replacement captain Andrew Flintoff, who had not been on tour due to a knee injury
 strans kaa do ankon main score duusare match main 61 tha, lekin flintoff captaini se vishram chaahate the, isliye paanchaven match main captaini strans ko saunp di gai, yah match guwahati main darshakon kii bheed dwaara hinsa ke chalate radd kar diya gaya tha
 In the next ODI, with Straintoff as the twelfth player, Strauss batted first with India, then a century partnership with Ian Bell, who contributed 74 at the time of retirement due to a hamstring strain, with a superb win with eight overs remaining
 England's only one-day success of this tour was because India successfully chased down the target with 5 balls remaining in the final match, Strauss's contribution in this was just 25 runs
 pichley do varsh ke ullasonmad ke baad england puure shatkaal main bina kisi shrinkhalaa vijay ke thakee hui ghar lauti to upmahadwipiya tikdi kaa raaj puraa hua kyoki jab vahaan srilanka pahunchaa to usne yah siddh kar diya ki asian varchasv keval bhartiya upmahadweep tak hi simit nahin he
 Strauss's return to the captaincy crown to Flintoff focused only on his batting skills on the field which made him famous
 trescothique ke saath ek baar phir se pari aarambh karke strans lunch ke samay ardhshtak se do ran purv hi muthaiya muralidharan kii gendbaazi kaa shikaar hote gaye, iske baad cook tathaa shesh khilaadi wicket par aae
 Strauss went ahead as the final wicket of Sri Lanka's first innings caught Nuwan Kulasekhar off Flintoff's ball which gave England a chance to follow-on to Sri Lanka, but England could not take advantage of this follow-on and drew the match
 done
 duusare test main 16 ran par pad se lag kar duusari slip main gai gend par vivaadaaspad dhang se out hone se pehle strans ne england kii donon pariyon main duusare sabase zyada ran banaae the
 He scored another half-century in the third Test, although this was not enough to prevent a 134-run defeat
 ek baar phir khel ke laghu rup ke liye strans ko captaini kii peshkash kii gai, unhone srilanka se do ran kii haar vaale tanavyukt match main england team kaa netritv kiya, jahaan unhone trescothique ke saath 59 ran kii salaami saajhedaari kii thi
 Under Strauss's captaincy, England had to endure a five-match washout, where Strauss could not muster even 50 runs, although it was accepted that the team, especially the bowling side of the team, was weak
 jab england apane ashes se lekar vishwacap tak kaa vyast antarrashtriya kaarykram shuru kiya, to ek divasiy main dhulaai hone ke baavjood, strans par bharosa jataate hue unhen pakistan ke greeshmakaleen daure ke liye kaaryvahak ke sthaan par aupchaarik captain bana diya gaya, test captaini ko dekhte hue, pehla match unke pasandida lords maidan par hua jisamen unhone ek or shatak darj kiya, is baar 128 duusari pari main, lekin unki is baat ke liye aalochana hui ki unhone jeet ke liye apane gendbaajon ko sirf 80 over die the, jise ve hasil nahin kar paae
 duusare test main unhone chust kshetrarakshan ke dwaara sthiti main jabardast parivartan kiya jisane pakistan ko donon pariyon main 250 ke neeche simit kar diya or england ke tej gati se bane 461 ke score main unka yogadan 42 kaa tha, isse unhen maatr teen din main ek pari se prabhaavshaalee jeet mili
 Although the third Test match was not so strong, the second innings, like the other three innings, won by not scoring a century and scoring a century, 116, and got an unbeatable lead in the series
 strans kii captaini main pehali test siries ovel par kuch vivaadon ke saath samaapt hui, ise camentataron dwaara ovelgate kaa naam diya gaya, duusari pari ke dauraan ampire derel hair or billy doctrove ne gend kaa nirikshan kiya or nishchay laya ki gend ke saath chhedchhad kii gai thi
 Disgraced by the charge, the Pakistan team did not come on the field after tea, protesting, as a result the umpire had to declare the match canceled
 Pakistan later tried to come to the ground, but the umpire justified his decision
 The decision was changed to a draw two years later after a petition by Pakistan, but the original decision was restored in February 2009 amid criticism that such a historical precedent would set the wrong precedent
 is prakaar shrinkhalaa england ke paksh main 3-0 se samaapt ho gai, jisamen strans ko mohammad younus ke baad england kii ore se sarvaadhik ran banane ke kaaran shrinkhalaa kaa sarvshereshth khilaadi ghoshit kiya gaya
 Strauss continues to captain the limited-overs team
 ek maatr twanti20 antarrashtriya main ve acha pradarshan nahin kar sake, shunya par hi out ho gaye or pakistan ne do over shosh rahete hi match jeet liya, or jab ek divasiy shrinkhalaa aarambh hui tab bhi unka bhagya vaisaa hi rahaa
 He scored 50 in the third match after two fewer scores, even though his team lost the match, although his 78 runs in the fourth match gave him an eight-wicket victory and then England with their highest score of 35 Equalized the series by -2
 agle maheene england bharat main champions trophy ke liye upmahadweep main laut aayaa
 Strauss scored two half-centuries in three matches, but the team as a whole played badly and only managed one win against the West Indies
 champions trophy ke baad jaise hi andryu flintoff ko match ke liye feet ghoshit kiya gaya, captaini waapas unke paas aa gai
 Strauss made a very poor start to the tour, scoring only 71 runs in four innings in a generally poor performance of the entire team
 pehle donon test ganvaa dene ke baad, vibhajit dressing room ke bare main prashn khadey hone lage, kyonki strans or flintoff ke bich captaini baar-baar hastantarit ho rahi thi, lekin strans ne in aaropon ko koi mahatva nahin diya
 He then scored 88 runs in a practice match, but in the next Test, he was dismissed due to questionable decisions in both innings, caught at 42 and lbw to zero, with replays suggesting both decisions were harsh
 mukkebaaji diwas test main strans ne apane is daure kii ek maatr pahchaan surakshit kii jab unhone 50 ran banaae, haalanki unhen yah shen worne ke 700wein test shikaar ke rup main adhik yaad rahegaa, jo australian spinner ne apane jivan ke antim test, jab tak ashes unke haath se ja chukaa thi, se purv ke match main liya tha
 As if the washing up was not enough in five matches, Strauss had to go to the hospital after Brett Lee was ruled out with a bouncer to his head in the final innings of the series
 shrinkhalaa ke baad test team ke coach dancan flechar ne strans or paul collingwood donon main aatmavishvaas kii kami par khed vyakt kiya, jinhen ve shesh team ke liye ek adarsh ke rup main protsaahit karnaa chaahate the
 Despite his performance deterioration at the end of the year, Strauss was selected at the 2006 Wisden Chalice in view of poor umpiring decisions
 test shrinkhalaa ke baad, england ne rashtramandal bank trikoniya shrinkhalaa ke abhyaas ke liye ek maatr twanti20 antarrashtriya khelaa
 Strauss was ruled out of the Twenty20 match but played in the one-day series
 haalanki england kii khel ke laghu praaroop kii tulana main deergh prapip main behatar karne kii pravriti he, unhone aarambhik paraajayon ke baad raftaar pakad lee or newjiland ko parajeet kar diya, jaisaa ki hota he group str par chaahe haare hon lekin jo ant main jeet gaya vahi vijeta hota he, strans ke 55 ran hi unka ek maatr ullekhneey score tha
 By this time, Strauss's poor form had been exposed in the ODI, with Fletcher admitting that he was taken into the squad mostly due to shallow batting options
 haalanki es ardhshtak ne unke aatmavishvaas ke liye kuch nahin kiya kyonki pehle final main ve shunya par out ho gaye or duusare main chah par, haalanki unhone ponting or mike hasi, donon ko ikai ank ke score par samit rakh kar dakworth-louis prabhavit score kaa upyog england ke jeetne ke liye kiya ja saktaa tha taaki tisare match kii jarurat hi na pade

 They played all the remaining matches for England until England were knocked out; He did not play one-day cricket for England again for the next two years
 antat khel ke donon antarrashtriya swaroopon main kharaab varsh ke baad, yahaan tak ki unhen sirf test par hi dhyaan kendrit karne kii anumati die jane ke baavjood, 43 test match ke baad unhen test team se hataa diya gaya
 Strauss's poor performance continued until 2007, with a failure to score a single century with less than 27 and a highest score of 96
 jabaki unhone bharat or west indies ke viruddh test match khelnaa jari rakhaa tha, unhen oriai team se baahar kar diya gaya
 In late 2007, Strauss was not selected in the squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and Michael Vaughan was selected to take his opener position
 strans ne tab ghoshnaa kii ki ve, jaisaa ki unhone varnit kiya, "lambey, thakaaoo or behad niraashajanak 12 maheenon" ke baad cricket se avkaash le rahe hai
 However, he was able to travel to India as a backup to the team if he so wanted
 strans ko is prakaar england ke sardiyon main cricket maichon se hataa diya gaya tha
 He returned to the Test team for the tour of New Zealand, but scored just four runs in a practice match before being hit wicket himself
 is tathy ke baavjood ki 25 test pariyon se ab tak unhone ek bhi shatak nahin lagaaya tha, strans ko ovas shah par tarjeeh dete hue duusare abhyaas match main khilne ke liye chunaa gaya, isse ye atakalein lagane lagi thim ki unhen newjiland ke viruddh pehle test match kii team main sthaan mil jayega
 jaisaa ki srilanka ke viruddh kiya gaya tha won or cook ko salaami ballebaaji ke liye chhod kar strans ko tisare kram par ballebaaji ke liye rakhaa gaya
 His batting was poor in the first innings and he was dismissed for 5 runs
 haalanki duusari pari main ve salaami ballebaaj ke sthaan par laute or ian bel ke saath naabad 104 ran banaae
 Strauss continued to play poorly in the first two games and was dismissed for zero in the first innings of the third match
 duusari pari main, tathaapi, unhone 226 gendon main, apana sabase dhimaa lekin agast 2006 ke baad se pehla shatak puraa kiya or aage jaakar test cricket kaa apana sarvocch score 177 banaaya
 The innings looked as if Strauss regained his luster, as in the first half of the England home season that followed, he scored 163 off 130 balls in a home ODI match for Middlesex
 
 unke 177 ke baad, usee pratidwandvi ke viruddh aagaamee shrinkhalaa ke liye team main strans kaa sthaan surakshit ho gaya tha
 While he was still unnoticed for the one-day international, he was given his Test opener position back alongside Alastair Cook and Michael Vaughan went back down the third order
 lords par barish se prabhavit match main unhone apni form jari rakhi or kheli gai england kii ek maatr pari main dhime lekin niyamit 63 ran banaae
 Strauss gave England a good start in the first innings by scoring another 60 before being dismissed in the second Test, which enabled England to score a big score
 tab 294 kaa peechha karte hue unhone ballebaaji ke liye ek kathin wicket par duusari pari main 106 ran banaae jisase england ne 6 wicket se yah match jeet kar teen maichon kii shrinkhalaa main 1-0 kii badhat praapt kar lee
 This was Strauss's second Test century at Old Trafford
 In the third and final Test at Trent Bridge, he scored 37 runs in England's first and only innings and England won the series 2–0
 unke dwaara 66

 His form was now affecting the selectors, allowing Strauss to retain his order against South Africa on the tour

 However, in the first innings of the second Test match at Hadlingley, he scored just 27 runs and zero in the second

 Strauss managed to make his place for the tour of India and scored 123 runs in the first innings of the first Test match and gave it to the selectors, while the rest of the batting was lost
 iske baad jab england kii ballebaaji dhahne lagi to unhone ballebaaji kaa kram thame rakhaa or 43-3 se paul collingwood ke saath 200 ran kii saajhedaari kii jisamen strans or collingwood donon ne 108 ran banaae

 In the fourth Test at Headingley, issues with team selection distracted Strauss before the game began, with both Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff injured, and a ten-minute delay in play due to Matt Prior's back cramps
 Occurred because his fitness to play was ascertained
 fire alarm jo subah 5 baje team ke hotel main baja tha, yaa media saakshaatkaar jo unhone ballebaaji shuru karne se thik pehle diya tha, ne strans kii ekaagratha ko prabhavit kiya tha, ve bhaagyashaalee the ki unhen match kii pehali ball par pagabaadha out nahin diya gaya, tathaa kuch der baad hi unhen 3 ran par out kar diya gaya, parinamswaroop england stuart clark or peter sidle ke khilaaf 102 rann par dher ho gaya

 When equalized, the Ashes are held by the previous time winner
 strans ne england kii pehali pari ke 332 rann main 55 ran kaa yogadan diya, isse pehle stuart broad or greem swaan ne milakar apratyaashit rup se australia ko 160 rann par out kar diya tha

 Strauss was named as the best player of the series by Australian coach Tim Nielsen; He finished the series with a total of 474 runs at an average of 52
66
 Strauss's dominance with the bat was such that 6 of the 7 batsmen who scored the most runs in the series were from Australia, yet they lost the series

 nutrino yah ek nayaa kan he jiskaa sarvapratham avishkaar san 1930 main pauli ne kiya tha
 The first theoretical basis of this particle was given by the famous physicist Fermi in 1934
 nutrino ke gun sankshep main nimnlikhit hai : While examining the reactions that make up the beta rays, it was observed that the energy spectrum of the protruding particles is different from the energy spectrum of the alpha ray
 elfaa kirane pruthak rekha varnakram ke anusaar milti hai, par beta kirane unase purnat: bhinn prakaar ke santat varnakram kaa anukaran karti hai
 The energy spectrum of the beta ray obtained for radium-e is shown in the figure
 beta kirnon kii urja kaa shunya se lekar adhiktam maan i a ke bich koi bhi maan ho saktaa he
 The same continuous spectrum is also found in the reactions from which positrons are obtained
 beta kirnon dwaara die santat varnakram kaa saidhantik aadhaar sthir karnaa bahut samay tak kathin samasya bana rahaa
 Suppose from a nucleus A, which is at the bottom of a particular energy, a beta ray emits and by this reaction another nucleus b is formed, which is again at the bottom of a particular energy
 puj evam urjasthirataa ke siddhant: ke anusaar, nikle hue beta kan kii urja nabhik k evam kha ke urjatalon k antar ke baraabar honi chahie
 This energy principle is always equal to e = mc2
 pariksha se kan shunaya se lekar E=mc2 tak sabhi maan kii urja lekar nikalate hai
 It seems that in such reactions some part of the energy is lost and the principle of mass and energy stability is violated
 is samasya ko fermi ne beta kiran ke baad vaali apni nutrino upakalpana dekar sarvapratham safaltaapurvak suljhaayaa
 He suggested that another particle, the neutrino, is also obtained in the beta-ray reactions and that the same dissipated energy is absorbed
 aaj tak pariksha se nutrino kii pahchaan nahin ho pai he, falat: iske gun aise hone chahie jinke kaaran isaki pahchaan ati kathin ho
 Therefore it was assumed that the neutrino is free of charge and its weight is much less than that of electrons, almost zero
 nutrino kaa aaveshrahit hona, beta kiran kii abhikriya ke liye aaveshasthirataa ke siddhant ke anusaar he
 According to the neutrino hypothesis, the amount of energy received in the beta ray reaction is e
 yah urja beta kan nutrino evam pratikshipt nabhik ko praapt hoti he
 The energy division among the three particles can be very different, hence the spectral spectrum is formed
 jab ek nabhik se beta kiran praapt hoti he, tab nabhik ke aavesh kaa ikai dwaara parivartan hoti he, tab nabhik ke aavesh kaa ikai dwaara parivartan hota he, bhaar aparivartit rahata he
 If an electron is obtained, then the number of protons in the nucleus increases by one unit and the number decreases by unit of unit by the cleavage unit
 usee bhanti yadi beta kiran abhikriya main ek positron praapt ho to proton sankhya ikai dwaara kam tathaa cliban sankhya main ikai kii vruddhi hoti he
 These beta adaptations can be explained in the following way: in abhikriyaaon main neutron ko proton, electron evam nutrino se bana hua nahin mana gaya he
 At the time of beta-emission, neutrons are instantly converted into three particles
 isi prakaar kaa nivartan beta +utsarjan main proton main ho jaataa he
 And other properties of neutrinos are also given by equations
 koniya gamata h / 2 maan lee jane par hi uski sthirataa kaa niyam thik thik ghatit hota he
 Similarly, information about statistics is also available
 sameekaran evam main yadi sankhyikee kii sthirataa dekhi jaay, to yah niyam tabhi satya thahartaa he jab nutrino fermi-diraaq sankhyikee kaa anusaran kare
 The neutrino hypothesis was also used to solve the problems of weathering of masons
 mu-meson jab ek electron main parivartit hota he tab beta-kiran abhikriya kii bhanti, mrami tathaa urja sthirataa ke niyam khandit ho jate hai
 For the correctness of these rules, the following method was suggested: usee prakaar elfaa-meson apkshay nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara dikhalaayaa ja saktaa he
 And there is no syntactic evidence against equations is bhanti nutrino dwaara beta kiran evam meson ke apkshya kii samasyaon kaa samaadhan hua he
 All the evidence for this particle is still indirect

 Sify Limited is a major internet service provider company, based in Chennai, India
 isaki mukhya sevaayen nimna hai: Also comes
 sifi kaa praveshdwar www
sify
com ne Indiaworld
com kaa adhikraman bhi kar rakhaa he
 Sify is India's main internet service provider
 ise vishwa bhar kii It was rated as one of "the ten top technology companies world-wide recommended for investment" by Fortune in 1999
 Sify was an early pioneer in India in setting up internet portals
 When internet access was opened to private sector, Sify became the first private sector player to offer internet access
 Sify's business model was interesting
 It leased international bandwidth from global vendors, domestic connectivity from telecom players and set up last mile connectivity by multiple methods: wi-fi connections using roof top antennae, copper connections using phone lines or cable tv connections
 Sify also started providing internet network connectivity for business enterprises in India
 Sify took internet to the masses in India by setting up a chain of franchised internet cafes becoming the largest chain of cybercafes in India
 Sify acquired a competitor portal www
indiaworld
com for $115 million 
 Sify is now owned by Mr
 Raju Vegesna, the enterpreneur who has made several billion dollars with his other companies Serverworks and Serverengines
 He took over the company in June of 2006 after Mr
 Ramaraj quit as the company's CEO
 Under the leadership of Mr
 Vegesna, the company has earned a maiden profit after 10 years of its inception
 As of March 31st 2006, it has 171 points of presence serving more than 250 cities in the country 
 International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories
 
 adhikansh deshon main, yah sakal gharelu utpaada ke mahatvapurn ansh kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 While international trade has been present for most of its history, its economic, social and political importance has begun to increase in recent centuries
 antarrashtriya vyapaar vyavastha par audyogikaran, unnat parivahan, vaishvikaran, bahurashtriya nigam or bahyasrot se kaarynishpaadan, in sabhi kaa vyapak prabhaav padataa he
 Increasing international trade is important for the continuation of globalization
 antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bina, desh sirf apni khud kii seemaa ke bheetar utpaadit maal or sevaaon tak simit rah jaaenge
 International trade is no different from domestic trade in principle because the motivation and behavior of the parties involved in a trade does not change fundamentally, regardless of whether the trade is cross-border or not
 mukhya antar yah he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar aam taur par gharelu vyapaar se adhik mahangaa he
 The reason for this is that a border usually imposes additional charges such as tariffs, periodic costs due to delays on the border and costs associated with country variations such as language, legal system or culture
 gharelu or antarrashtriya vyapaar ke bich ek or antar yah he ki puunji or shram jaise utpaadan kaarak aam taur par baahar kii tulana main deshon ke bheetar adhik gatisheel hote hai
 Thus international trade is mostly limited to the trade of goods and services and only on a small scale in trade of capital, labor or other factors of production
 In addition, trade in goods and services can act as a substitute for trade in production factors
 utpaadan kaa ek kaarak aayaat karne ke bajaay, ek desh maal aayaat kar saktaa he jo utpaadan ke kaarak kaa gahan istemaal kare or is prakaar sambandhit kaarak ko sammilit kar le
 ek udhaaharan he, china se sanyukt rajya america dwaara shram-pradhan vastuon kaa aayaat
 chini shram kaa aayaat karne ke bajaay america, china se aise maal aayaat kar rahaa he jise chini shram ke istemaal se utpaadit kiya gaya he
 International trade is also a branch of economics, which together with international finance forms the broad branch of international economics
 vyapaar kii paddati kaa purvanumaan lagane or prashulk jaisi vyapaar nitiyon ke prabhaav kaa vishleshan karne ke liye anek alag namoonay prastaavit kiye gaye hai
 The Ricardian model focuses on comparative advantage and is perhaps the most important concept in international trade theory
 ek ricardian model main, desh un chizon ke utpaadan main visheshgyata hasil karte hai jin chizon kaa utpaadan ve acha karte hai
 Unlike other models, the Ricardian framework predicts that countries will specialize instead of producing a wide range of goods
 iske alaava, ricardian model kaarak nidhi par sidhe vichaar nahin karata, jaise desh ke bheetar shram or puunji kii saapeksh maatra
 ricardin model kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki yah deshon ke bich praudyogiki bhinnataaon kii kalpana karata he
 The technology gap is easily incorporated into the Ricardian and ricardo-sraffa models
 ricardian model nimnlikhit anumaan lagaataa he: The Ricardian model makes short-term measurements, so the technology varies internationally
 yah is tathy kaa samarthan karata he ki desh apane tulanaatmak laabh kaa paalan karte hai or visheshgyata ke liye anumati dete hai
 The Ricardian business model was studied by Graham, Jones, Mackenzie and others
 sabhi siddhanton main madhyavarti maal, vasteen or puunjigat maal jaise vyapaarit input maal ko baahar rakhaa gaya
 mckenzie, Jones, and Samuelson emphasized that considerable profits would be lost by the exclusion of intermediate goods from trade
 In a famous comment Mackenzie stated that "the idea of a moment would explain to a person that Lancashire would be unlikely to produce cotton cloth if cotton had to be grown in England
" haal hi main, is siddhant ko vistaarit karte hue isamen vyapaarik madhyavarti maamle ko bhi shaamil kiya gaya
 Thus the "labor only" assumption was removed from the theory
 is prakaar nayaa ricardian siddhant, jise kabhi-kabhi ricardo-srapha model kaa naam bhi diya jaataa he, saidhantik rup se puunjigat vastuon ko shaamil karata he jaise mashine or samagriyaan, jinka deshon ke bich kaarobaar hota he
 In times of global trade, this assumption is more realistic than the heckscher-olin model, which assumes that capital is stable within the country and not internationally dynamic
 1900 ke dashak ke armbh main, do swedish arthshaastriyon, eli heksher or bertil olin ne kaarak anupaat siddhant naam ke ek antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant kaa srijan kiya
 This theory is also called the heckscher-olin theory
 heksher-olin siddhant is baat par jor detaa he ki deshon ko aise maal kaa utpaadan or niryaat karnaa chahie jise aise sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho, jo prachur hon or aise maal kaa aayaat karnaa chahie jise alp-aapurti vaale sansadhano kii aavashyaktaa ho
 This theory differs from the theories of comparative advantage and absolute advantage because these theories focus on the productivity of the production process for a particular commodity
 iske vipareet, heksher-olin siddhant kahata he ki ek desh ko utpaadan or niryaat main un karkon kaa upyog karte hue visheshgy hona chahie jo sabase prachur maatra main hon or isliye saste hon
 un maal kaa utpaadan naa karen, jaisaa ki pehle ke siddhanton ne kaha, jo ve sabase adhik kushalta se utpaadit karte hai
 The Heckscher – Olin model was constructed as an alternative to the Ricardian model of basic comparative advantage
 isaki adhik jatilta ke baavjood yah apane purvanumaanon main adhik sateek sabit nahin hua
 But from a theoretical point of view it provides an elegant solution by incorporating neo-classical value mechanisms into international trade theory
 is siddhant kaa tark he ki antarrashtriya vyapaar kaa pattern, kaarak nidhi main antar se nirdhaarit hota he
 It predicts that countries will export goods that use locally abundant factors and will import goods that use factors that are locally scarce
 H-O model ke saath anubhavjanya samasyaayein, jise leontiff virodhabhas ke rup main janaa jaataa he, wesile leontiff dwaara anubhavjanya pareekshanon main saamne ain jinhone paaya ki puunji kii bahutayat hone ke baavjood america shram-pradhan maalon ko niryaat kar rahaa tha
 The HO model makes the following main assumptions: H-O siddhant ke saath samasya yah he ki yah puunjigat vastuon ke vyapaar ko shaamil nahin karata he 
H-O siddhant main, shram or puunji, prayek desh ke liye sthir padaarth hai
 In a modern economy, capital goods are traded internationally
 madhyavarti vastuon ke vyapaar se laabh kaaphi hota hai, jaisaa ki samuelson dwaara bal diya gaya tha 
 Many economists prefer the Heckscher – Olin theory than the Ricardo theory, as it makes less straightforward assumptions
 1953 main, wesile leontiff ne ek adhyayan prakashit kiya, jahaan unhone heksher-olin siddhant kii vaidhata kaa pareekshan kiya
 adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki anya deshon kii tulana main america puunji main adhik prachur tha, isliye america puunji-pradhan maal kaa niryaat kar rahaa tha or shram-pradhan maal kaa aayaat
 leontiff ne paaya ki aayaat kii tulana main america kaa niryaat kam puunji-pradhan tha
 After the Leontief paradox emerged, many researchers tried to save the heckscher-olin theory, either by new methods of measurement, or by new interpretations
 Leamer emphasized that Leontief did not correctly interpret the HO theory and claimed that contradiction did not occur with a correct interpretation
 brechar or choudri ne paaya ki, agar limar sahi tha, to america mazaduron kii prati vyakti khapat, mazdooron ke vishwa ausat khapat se kam honi chahie
 Later several other tests took place but most of them failed
 kai prasiddh pathyapustak lekhak, jinamein shaamil hai krugman or obstfeld or boven, holender or vien, H-O model kii vaidhata ke bare main nakaaratmak hai
 
 After testing a long history of empirical research, Bowen, Hollander, and VN concluded: "recent tests of the factor abundance theory that directly examine the HOV equations also indicate a rejection of the theory"
 : 321 heksher-olin siddhant ko dakshin-uttar vyapaar samasyaon kaa vishleshan karne ke liye acchhee tarah anukulit nahin kiya gaya he
 Estimates of HO are less realistic regarding NS than NN trade
 uttar or dakshin ke bich aay bhinnata hi ek aisi chiz he jisaki teesri duniya ko sabase zyada parvaah hoti he
 The factor price equalization has not shown much sign of recovery
 HO model maanata he ki deshon ke bich samaan utpaadan kaary karata he
 This is very unrealistic
 viksit or vikasshil deshon ke bich praudyogiki kii bhinnata, garib deshon ke liye chintaa kaa mukhya vishay he
 In this model, labor mobility between industries is possible, while capital is stable between industries in the short term
 is prakaar, is model ko heksher-olin model ke ek 'alpakaaleen' sanskaran ke rup main vyakhya kii ja sakati he
 The specific factor name refers to what is provided, in the short term, specific factors of production such as physical capital are not easily transferable between industries
 siddhant yah suzav detaa he ki agar maal kii keemat main vruddhi hoti he, to us maal ke vishisht sandarbh main utpaadan ke kaarak ke maalikon ko vaastavik rup se acha laabh hoga
 In addition, owners of specific factors of anti-production are likely to have opposing agendas when they seek favors to control labor immigration
 iske vipareet, puunji or shram, donon ke maalikon ko puunji nidhi main vruddhi se vaastavik rup main laabh hota he
 This model is ideal for particular industries
 yah model aay vitaran ko samajhane ke liye adarsh he lekin vyapaar kii paddati kii charchaa karne ke liye bhadda he
 New business theory tries to explain many facts about trade, which is difficult for the two main models outlined above
 isamen yah tathy bhi shaamil he ki zyaadaatar vyapaar, samaan kaarak bandobasti or utpaadakta str or maujuud bahurashtriya utpaadan kii badi maatra vaale deshon ke bich hota he
 In one example of this framework, the economy exhibits monopoly competition and increasing profits on a scale

 apane mul rup main gurutvkarshan model, deshon ke bich kii duuri or deshon ke aarthik aakaar kii paraspar kriya ke aadhaar par vyapaar kaa purvanumaan lagaataa he
 This model mimics Newton's theory of gravity, which also considers the distance and physical shape between two objects
 yah model arthmetiya vishleshan ke madhyam se bhi anubhavjanya taur par majboot siddh hua he
 Other factors such as income level, diplomatic relations between countries, and trade policies are also included in extended versions of the model

 Under the belief in mercantilism for many centuries, customs were high and many restrictions on international trade in most countries

 Since then this notion has become the dominant thinking among the western countries

 These trade agreements, coupled with unfair trade claims that are not profitable for developing countries, have often led to protests and dissatisfaction
 mukt vyapaar kaa aam taur par, aarthik rup se sarvaadhik majboot deshon dwaara sabase adhik samarthan kiya jaataa he, haalanki ve aksar un udyogon ke liye chaynaatmak sangrakshanvaad main sanlagn hote hai jo ranneetik rup se mahatvapurn hai, jaise america or europe dwaara krishi par lagaaya jane vaala surakshatmak prashulk

 Traditionally agricultural interests generally favor free trade, while manufacturing sectors often support protectionism
 haalanki, haal ke varshon main isamen kuch had tak badlaav aayaa he
 In fact, agricultural groups, particularly in the United States, Europe, and Japan, are primarily responsible for specific regulations in major international trade treaties that allow for more protectionist measures in agriculture than most other goods and services

 Regulation of international trade is done globally through the World Trade Organization and through many other regional arrangements such as MERCOSUR in South America, the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, and European between 27 independent countries Union
 The 2005 Buenos Aires negotiations on the planned establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas were thwarted mainly by opposition from the population of Latin American countries

 Companies trading across international borders face the same risks normally reflected in staunch domestic transactions
 udhaaharan ke liye, In addition, international trade also faces the risk of adverse exchange rate movements
 pichley lekh main charchaa kii he ki kaise antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa samarthan paristhitiki pranaaliyon or vyapaar ke anukool nitiyon kii jarurat he, to ve ubharate bazaaron main safal hone ke liye kar rahe hai
 Of particular importance is the role of governments in deciding whether they will allow international businesses to setup their operations and encourage them to grow and succeed
 aksar, kai deshon kii sarkaron ke liye ek vikalp nahin he lekin antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat karne ke rup main ve "nakadi" yaa dollar kii jarurat he, kyonki ve bhi janaa jaataa he
 For example, the difference between exports and imports is known as current account deficit or CAD
 kai ubharate bazaaron ke baad se ghate dollar ke saath vitt poshan kii jarurat he ki logon kii he
 Then, governments can borrow losses at high rates or finance losses through FDI or foreign direct investment and equity flows from fiis or foreign institutional investors to the stock markets
 iske alaava, gharelu udyog kshamtaaon ko ek vishesh kshetra he or na hi visheshgyata he ki kshetra kaa vikaas karne main safal hone ke liye nahin ho saktaa he
 Therefore, FDI becomes necessary for the development of that region
 iske alaava, arthvyavastha ke khulne vishwa vyapaar sanghathan yaa vishwa vyapaar sanghathan, jiskaa matlab he ki aadesh main, anya deshon ko niryaat karne ke liye ubharate bazaar or vikasshil arthvyavasthaaon main kholane ke liye he ki main pravesh ke liye aavashyak he
 For this reason, many governments in developing countries are doing something to encourage and allow foreign investment in international businesses to operate the setup in their respective countries
 haalanki, ek hi sarkaron kii nitiyon ko jari rakhane yaa nahin kaarak he ki sarkaron kii vaicharik tula, raajnneeti kii majaburiyon, or tathy yah he ki videshi nivesh kii yojana banaai arthvyavastha ke rup main shuru kik main safal nahin ho saktaa he shaamil kii ek mejabaan par nirbhar karata he
 The important aspect here is that many governments in emerging economies often welcome international businesses with open arms because of the above reasons
 haalanki, bich main hi prakriya ke madhyam se, unamem se kuch nitigat pakshaaghaat kii vajah se thand pair viksit karne, or karkon se upar soochibaddh he
 It is understandable that allowing international businesses to enter emerging economies needs to be bipartisan meaning that there should be a broad consensus on the issue from all stakeholders
 tabhi to antarrashtriya kaarobaar ubhartee bazaar arthvyavasthaaon main kaamyaab hogi
 In addition, competition for foreign capital is so intense that the process in an adverse economy and therefore, the process must be continued and the reason given incentives affect international businesses

 On the other hand, India and Russia are in the other way of example these countries opened their economies due to compulsions with open arms and then but unsuccessfully around to maintain momentum
