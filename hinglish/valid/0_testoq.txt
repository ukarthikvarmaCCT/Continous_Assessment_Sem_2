 Newton's theory was later replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
 isse purv varah mihir ne kaha tha ki kisi prakaar kii shakti hi vastuon ko pruthivi par chipkaae rakhti he
 Modern work on the theory of gravity began in the late 16th and early 17th century with the work of Galileo Galilei
 apane mashhoor prayogon main pisa ke tower se gendon ko chhodane kaa prayog kiya gaya, or baad main gendon ke saavdhaneepurvak maap ke saath incleain ko ghumaya gaya, galileo ne dikhaaya ki gurutvkarshan twaran sabhi vastuon ke liye samaan he
 This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have higher gravitational acceleration
 galileo ne hawa ke pratirodh ko is kaaran ke rup main bataaya ki kam dravyaman vaali vasteen vaataavaran main dhimi gati se gir sakati hai
 Galileo's work set the stage for the creation of Newton's theory of gravity iske baad ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he

 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa sambandh hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutv niyatank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used

 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 german khagolvid kepler ne grahon kii gati kaa adhyayan karke teen niyam diye
 Kepler's first law: - All planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits and the Sun is at the focus of those orbits
 dwitiya niyam - kisi bhi grah ko surya se milaane vaali rekha samaan samay me samaan kshetrafal paar karti he
 That is, the regional speed of each planet remains fixed
 arthath jab grah surya se dur hota he to uski chaal kam ho jaati he
 Third law: - The square of the Sun's rotation period of each planet is proportional to the third power of the semi-long axis of its long circular orbit
 gurutvkarshan: "pitaaji, yah prithvi, jis par ham nivas karte hai, kis par tiki hui he?" leelavati ne shatabdiyon purv yah prashn apane pita bhaskaracharya se poocha tha
 In response, Bhaskaracharya said, "bale Leelavati !, some people who say that this earth is based on Sheshnag, Tortoise or Elephant or any other thing, then they are wrong
 yadi yah maan bhi liya jaae ki yah kisi vastu par tiki hui he to bhi prashn bana rahata he ki vah vastu kis par tiki hui he or is prakaar kaaran kaa kaaran or phir uskaa kaaran


 yah kram chalata rahaa, to nyaay shaastra main ise anavastha dosha kehete hai
 Lilavati said, yet the question remains, what is the earth resting on? tab bhaskaracharya ne kaha, kyon ham yah nahin maan sakate ki prithvi kisi bhi vastu par aadhaarit nahin he
 xxrep 5 
 If we say that the earth rests on its own force and call it gravitational force, then what is the fault? is par leelavati ne poocha yah kaise sambhav he
 Then Bhaskaracharya says about the theory that the power of things is very strange
 aage kehete hai- That is, there is attraction power in the earth
 prithvi apni aakarshan shakti se baari padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he or aakarshan ke kaaran vah jameen par girte hai
 But when the same strength came from all around in the sky, how did anyone fall? That is, the planets in the sky remain motionless because the gravitational powers of various planets keep balance

 Seeing the major role of Hindi at the inter-communal level between the dialects like Avadhi, Brajbhasha, Bhojpuri, Magahi, Bundelkhandi, Rajasthani etc
, Ram Vilasji introduced the concept of 'hindi caste', so that these dialects can overcome the feeling of district or regional segregation
 Please accept Hindi as your ethnic language
 'niraala kii sahitya sadhana' dwitiya khand main ise spasht karte hue ramvilas ji ne likhaa he- The concept of Hindi caste is not new
 1902 kii ‘saraswati’ main shri karthik prasad ne ‘maharashtriya jati kaa abhyuday’ naamak lekh likhaa
 Just like there is a Maharashtrian caste in India, so is the Hindi caste in the Hindi heartland

 Ram Vilas Sharma presented the history of the smooth, natural development of Hindi in the entire country in the context of political, economic and business changes from medieval to modern period
 is kram main unhone rashtriya sampark-bhashaa, rashtrabhasha ke rup main hindi ke vikaas ko rekhaankit kiya, to duusari taraf avadhi, braj, bhojpuri aadi boliyon ke bich hindi ke jaateey bhashaa ke rup main pratishthit hone kaa tathy saamne rakhaa
 Just as the language identifies the castes of Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, etc
, people of the Hindi state should also be identified as a Hindi speaking caste instead of being identified on the basis of the dialects
 dow ramvilas sharma hindi jati ke saath-saath tamil, telugu, oriya, bengali aadi jatiyon kii charchaa bhi karte hai or unke vikaas par bal dete hai
 But they regret that the notion of ethnicity in other language-speaking areas is not as strong as in Hindi, which is why communalism and casteism are most visible in this region

 Ram Vilas Sharma continued to protest against the non-adoption of the formula forming the linguistic states in the Hindi region
 is sambandh main pi

 singh thik hi likhte hai- “ramvilas ji ko yah baat aaajeevan salti rahi ki bharat main bengali, punjabi, tamil, marathi, gujarati, telugu ityadi jatiyon kaa nirmaan to ho sakaa or ye raajnneetik ikai ke rup main viksit ho sakin lekin hindi pradesh main jaateey bodh kaa abhaav rahaa jiske chalate yah raajnneetik rup se vibhakt rahaa
 "whereas after a long process of ethnic construction and formation in the changing capitalist relations with historical economic development, Hindi has become the ethnic language of the people living here

 With a view to grabbing the state of Ramgarh by declaring Rajgarh Vikramajit Singh of Ramgarh as deranged and Aman Singh and Sher Singh as minor, the British rulers acted in the "court of Wards" and appointed Sheikh Mohammed and Mohammad Abdullah as governors for the administration of the state
 Sent to Ramgarh
 " jisase ramgarh riyasat "court of wards" ke kabje main chali gayi
 The queen also knew the result of this usurpation policy of the British rulers, yet she drove both the outgoing officers out of Ramgarh

 Now, as the guardian of minor sons, the state power came to the queen

 The strength of the British increased in 1857 with the construction of the Sagar and Narmada enclaves
 ab angrejon ko roak paanaa kisi ek raja yaa talukedaar ke vash kaa nahin rahaa
 The queen organized a huge conference of kings, parganadars, zamindars and big Malgujars from around the state at Ramgarh, presided over by King Shankarashah of Garh Purva
 is gupt sammelan ke bare main jabalpur ke kamishnar major iskain or mandla ke dipti kamishnar wadington ko bhi pataa nahin tha

 Due to the similarity between the Mayan Indian race of Central America and the architecture of ancient Egypt, it was also speculated that Indians came to America from Egypt or Egypt influenced countries

 Before ancient anthropological discoveries were made in America, there was also the possibility that the ancestors of Indians had developed as an independent branch of mankind on this land, but now it can be said with certainty that mankind on the American continents In the development of a branch of the Kumbh, only the preserved remains of lemurs, tarsiers and monkeys of certain castes have been found on this territory
 pracheen maanav jatiyon ke adhyeta parishrampurvak khoj karne par bhi nikatmanav vanar athwa pracheen maanav koi avshesh yahan nahin paa sake hai
 In this way, it can be said that there was no possibility of independent development of any branch of mankind here and the ancestors of the oldest inhabitants of this place would have settled here from any other part of the world

 The study of the remains of ancient Indians has confirmed the belief that the groups that came here earlier had more of the physical characteristics of the australoid-mongol species, and that later groups had predominance of elements of the Mongoloid species

 Stone tools, rubbish, bone and horn tools made by pressure or wear, the use of fire, the art of making traps and crates, bow and spear throwing instruments and domesticated dogs are probably the main elements of the original culture of Indians

 On the basis of the physical difficulties in maintaining such relations, it can be easily inferred that even if there was a relationship among these terrains, it would have been very limited in its extent and influence
 kalantar main saanskrithik vikaas kii jo dishaaen in samoohon ne apanaai ve bahm samskritiyon se prabhavit nahin hui
 These groups developed the new-age culture independently

 Here are some incarnations of Gaushala: The essence of the history of Rama Krishna is Goshala, an element in the memories, Vedos, Upanishads
 
 Religion itself becomes a habit of being a cow, in the country, religion and Sanskrit is the definition of a cow shed
 
 i drank a little more then felt drunk, the drinker drank the cup on the cup and dried it
 
 But there is no restriction on drinking cow vigorously, the more you drink, the stronger the goshala
 
 Disappeared pitu-mat, the brothers all became sister-in-law, sister-in-law was alienated, Jag became alienated, God was angry, angry Allahtala
 
 Broken Gaushala strengthens all relations with the world, by adding easy affection to the drinker
 
 At the party, no matter who drinks a cup of tea, even if you empty the urn, why not drink it? 
 But if the dessert is not there, everything will be called in vain, the gaushala feeds us the mustard sweets in the alms
 
 Before me, behind me, right - left cow, outside me, whatever is inside me, just cow shed
 
 i am the cow of the cows, let me always have goodwill, so i am happier than Surpur, i am my cow 
 Religion is not my hindu-muslim religion; Goshala, karma and duty, work
 Daily Sab Gaushala
 
 The caste of Gobhakta is varna - Go, Gobind - of worshiper, in one word my complete, introduction, only - Goshala
 
 Hun, Yavan, Shaka, Mlechha erased and drank, drunk, and imbibed everyone's poison
 
 But on whose strength the caste is alive till today? 
 The orgy of Danujata also happened to shake the heart, the thunderbolt fell on the monasteries and the monasteries in the temple
 
 But the pennant and the safe cowshed did not bow down, the traitors did their own work of caste
 
 Forgiveting Ripu for seventeen times, Singh Bhola spear, blinded Kehri and did not let it flow
 
 But even with blind eyes, the cowshed, the fire test took place, the drunken drunkenness of patience
 
 Payyapi cut off his head, but the broken, broke but did not bow, who were those advanced heads? His - their, whom - whom he loved, the goshala, who left the country with him and took his face black? Those whose arms were on my lips and lips
 
 Country - Pride of caste who fought, died and were alive, in the heart of sons, was a rotating cow
 
 Just yesterday, the Asura lying in the Chittor fort was brought up, where is that extinguished flame of Jauhar
 
 The deity of the demons failed, the divine goddesses became immortal, the hands were rubbing alcohol, and the cow was glowing
 
 Ghori and Gajnavi lootera Allahdheen poisonous Kala, Bakhtiyar Aurangzeb Ripu - Darun Griever
 
 Green! Come on! There have been so many problems on Gaushala, everyone has been standing with grief, Goshala is standing
 
 Spear started with Dhar, Prithviraj, Saridarsha Nar Bapparaval from Ala, Rana Sanga and Pratap
 
 Rakshita Goshala from Chhatrasal, Gobind, Shiva, Vairagi Sam Veer, Tilak, Subhash Prabirti's sons
 
 Goshala on the page-page of my pride history, this gaushala in every particle of my beloved India mother
 
 i have covered the body of my blood and blood, i will disappear on that day when it will not remain
 
 This slash will go away, this blackness will be black, on the new morning it will fall on the ground, then with golden dreams
 
 Heaven - will be like a world experience, we will again have our own country, village - village house - the day the house will open
