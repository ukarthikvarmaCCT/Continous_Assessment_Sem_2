 naa aana is desh lado ke anukram lado - virpur kii mardaani mahilaon kii taskari or yon shoshan jaise gambhir vishyon se sambandhit tha
 Naa Aana, one of the successful small screen serials, was the second season of this Desh Lado Lado 2 / Lado - Virpur Ki Mardaani
 aath saal baad yah sho apane duusare sizan ke saath waapas lautaa tha
 While the show in the first season was based on female feticide, this time the story raised serious issues such as the purchase and exploitation of women
 kahani kii baat karen to virpur main abhi bhi purushavaadi soch haaavee thi
 Balwant Singh ruled there, who kidnapped and sold girls
 virpur main koi bhi ladki surakshit nahin thi
 Located in the areas of Haryana, the show returned on 6 November 2017 and so did the hard and stiff Ammaji, which softened over time
 sho 70 varshiya buudhe aadmi ke saath shuru hua tha jo balavant singh kii haveli main pravesh karata he, jo ek yuva dulhan ke badale paise se bharaa bag dene aata he
 Balwant kidnapped young girls and sold them for huge profits
 is sho ne pehle sijan kii kahani kii samaapti ke baad ek lip liya tha or ammaji ke virpur main kai chijen badali thim, jise ab balavant singh dwaara shasit kiya jaataa tha, jiskaa aatank gaanv main failaa hua tha
 While na anna was rampant with female feticide and misogyny in this country Lado, however, the situation in Veerpur in Lado 2 worsened, as there were hardly any girls in the village who were not tortured, causing young girls There was an increase in kidnapping and crime against women
 ammaji, jo ab apni do potiyo ke saath dilli chali gai thim unhen virpur se dur rakhana chaahati thim sirf isiilie kyonki virpur yuva ladakiyon ke liye surakshit nahin tha
 Avika Gore, who played the character of Ammaji's elder granddaughter Anushka, was an independent and fearless person
 jabaki anoushka nidar thim or sahi ke liye ladane ke liye tatpar rahati thim, unki choti bahan jahnavi ek gharelu ladki thim or anoushka ke bilkul vipareet thim
 Born in Delhi, Anushka got the shock of her life when her sister Jahnavi was kidnapped in Veerpur, which was also the village of her ancestors
 meghna malik, jinhone ammaji kii bhoomika ko naa aana is desh lado se doharaaya tha, unke doshahin abhinay se yah sho hit jaataa tha
 Avika, who we saw in Balika Vadhu and Sasural Simar Ka, played a strong character in the show

 The situation in Veerapur was somewhat reminiscent of the 2003 film Matrubhoomi, which depicted the future of female feticide over the years
 sho praasangik muddon se sambandhit tha, kyonki maanav taskari bad rahi he or haryana or rajasthan rajyon main ling asantulan ne in kshetron main kai aapraadhik gatividhiyon ko janm diya he
 The issues raised in the serial's story and the horrors associated with it were seen in many films and crime based shows
 is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he, lekin yah mudda samayik he
 In many states the difference in the number of boys and girls has increased the incidence of crime against girls, so it is good to highlight such issues
 sho ke shuruaati episod main kahani ko khinchaa nahin gaya tha, balki kuch episods ke baad hi sho apni mul kahani par aa gaya tha
 Something happened in every episode, so that the show was able to engage the audience
 abhinay kii baat karen to ek baar phir meghna malik apane kirdaar se prabhavit karne main kaamayaab rahi thim, haalanki is baar sho main unki bhoomika bhakshak kii nahin, balki rakshak kii thi
 Seeing him act this time was no less than a treat
 avika kaa prakhar andaaz khaas tha
 He did justice once again with his talent
 palak jain bhi apni bhoomika se niraash nahin karti thim
 Rituraj was able to awaken hatred in the role of Balwant Singh
 baaqi ke kirdaar apane abhinay se kahani ko bakubi aage le ja chuke the
 The serial was on the backdrops of Haryana, Delhi and Chandigarh
 is baat ko kalakaaron ne samvaad adaayagi main bakubi aatmsaar kiya tha
 This thing was also taken care of in the look of the show

 kahani ke teen mukhya paatr hai : chandar, sudhaa or pammi
 The whole story revolves primarily around these characters
 chandar sudhaa ke pita yani vishvavidhyalay ke professor ke priy chaatro main he or professor bhi use putr tulya maanate hai
 This is the reason why Chandar keeps on visiting Sudha without any restriction
 dhire-dhire sudhaa kab dil de baithti he, yah donon ko pataa nahin chalata
 But this was not an ordinary love
 yah bhakthi par aadhaarit prem tha
 Chandar was the god of Sudha and Sudha always respected him like a devotee
 chander sudhaa se prem to karata he, lekin sudhaa ke papa ke us par kiye gaye ahsaan or vyaktitv par haaavee uske adarsh kuch aisa taana-bana bunate hai ki vah chaahate hue bhi kabhi apane man kii baat sudhaa se nahin kah paata
 In the eyes of Sudha, he wants to remain a god and this is what happens
 sudhaa se uskaa naata vaisaa hi he, jaisaa ek devtaa or bhakt kaa hota he
 Chander's conflict with love remains in most parts of the novel
 nateeja yah hota he ki sudhaa kii shaadi kahin or ho jaati he or ant main use duniya chhodkar janaa padataa he
 The author takes full care while portraying Chander's intimate moments with Pammi
 puure prasang main thodaa sexual tach to he, par valgarity kahin nahin he, usamen siharan to he, lekin yah pathakon ko uttejit nahin karata
 How close the author himself is to this novel can be gauged from his statement

 In fact, this is the only subject that prepares young students for two important goals of their lives - caring for home and family and preparing for a career or profession in their lives
 aajkal mahila tathaa purush donon hi ghar tathaa parivaar kii jimmedaariyaan samaan rup se nibhaate hai tathaa apane jivan ko sukhmay banane ke liye uplabdh sansadhano ke behatar upyog kii taiyaari main bhi baraabar kii sahabhaagita nibhaate hai
 Home science or home science is related to you, your home, your family members and everything related to your resources
 iskaa uddeshy he - aapke sansadhano ke prabhaavshaalee tathaa vaigyanik upyog dwaara aapako tathaa aapke parivaar ke sadasyon ko bharpoor santushti pradaan karnaa
 Home science means the art of effective management of your resources and a science that helps you to keep a home healthy and peaceful and in the choice of a successful profession when needed
 grih vigyaan aapako chizon ko upyog karne kii kala sikhaata he, jisase ki chaaron or ek sampurna suvyavastha, sundarataa or aandmayi vaataavaran ke nirmaan main sahaayta milti he
 In addition, it also provides scientific information related to home care
 ise ham ek udhaaharan ke dwaara aasaani se samaj sakate hai- grih vigyaan sharir ke liye aavashyak poshak tattvon ke bare main jaankaree pradaan karata he tathaa saath hi unke kaaryon ke bare main bhi bataata he
 It is a 'science'
 or jab aap inhen aavashyak poshak tattvon se bharpoor bhojan ko apane parivaar ko aakarshak dhang se paroste hai to yah ek ’kala’ he
 This coordination of science and art comes in every area of your life
 unamem se kuch nimnlikhit hai - After studying various areas of home science, you can better manage your resources
 yadi aisa karte hue aapako kisi prakaar kii samasya pesh aati he, to grih vigyaan use hal karne ke liye aapako sahi disha nirdesh degaa
 By doing this you become an influential person

 are some other resources which are helpful in management and home science helps you a lot in this
 aajkal zyaadaatar mahilaayein kaamkaaji hai, jo yaa to kaam karne ke liye ghar se baahar jaati hai, yaa ve ghar par hi rah kar apana swayan kaa koi rojgaar chalaati hai
 As a result, men's participation in household responsibilities has also increased
 chunki hamaare samaaj main paramparaagat rup se purush dhar ke kaaryon main bahut kriyasheel nahin hote, isliye unhen is vyavastha main dhalane main kaaphi pareshaani kaa anubhav hota he
 In such a situation, they need to know about the different aspects of the house and learn the skill to make the house beautiful and run properly
 grih vigyaan hi ek maatr aisa vishay he, jo yuvaaon ko ek safal grihasth banane, ek jimmedaar naagarik or ek achche mata-pita banane main sahaayak purvaabhyas or aavashyak suchanaane uplabdh karaata he
 Although home science is working in a very wide field of education, but even today, there is confusion in the mind of the common man about this subject
 or yah bhram kii sthiti keval isliye bani hui he ki log sochate hai ki ve jo sammaan or darja praapt karnaa chaahate hai vah sab de paane main grih vigyaan sakasham nahin he
 Mythology - Home science is limited only to cooking, washing and sewing-embroidery works - common people believe that all these things are taught and taught in it
 isliye yuva ladakiyon ke mata-pita badi aasaani se unhen yah vishay padhaane ke liye taiyaar ho jate hai
 They think it will help them in their later life
 sachai - khaanaa pakaana, kapade dhonaa or rakhana tathaa kadhai-bunai to grih vigyaan ke antargat padhaayaa jane vaala ek bahut hi chota sa hissaa he
 Actually, through this we learn all the basics related to our life - how our body functions, what kind of diet we need to be healthy, what rules to be followed for our own and environment cleanliness
 It is necessary that we should do to avoid diseases and what kind of management should be done when we and our souls are sick
 isamen ham ghar ke vividh kaaryon main upyog hone vaale kapadon ke chunaav ke bare main sikhte hai
 Children are an integral part of our life
 ham sabhi chaahate hai ki unka surakshit or samuchit vikaas ho
 In this course we learn how children develop before and after birth and what role we can play in their development as a good and responsible citizen
 iske alaava ham samay, urja tathaa paise jaise apane sansadhano kaa prabandhan bhi sikhte hai, jisase ki unke adhikadhik upyog se adhik santushti kaa anubhav karte hai
 Misconception - Home science is only related to girls - Many people believe that home science only teaches work related to home, so it should be read only by girls
 sachai- aaj mahilaayein tathaa purush donon ghar kii jimmedaariyon kaa baraabar saajha karte hai, kyonki aaj hamaare samaaj kii banaavat main kaaphi parivartan aayaa he
 Today, joint families are breaking up into single families
 aise main ghar kii jimmedaariyon ko pati or patni ko khud hi sanbhaalanaa padataa he
 Most women have started going to work outside the home, so men have become more and more in need of education about household responsibilities
 or in sari baton kii taiyaari athwa purvaabhyas keval grih vigyaan main hi ek vishay ke rup main mil sakati he
 This is the reason that many young men today have been oriented towards reading this subject

 The Tamil language movement also featured Tamil mother and Tamil nationality as mother in Tamil Nadu
 tamil asmita ke punaruddhar or tamil gaurav ke matra rup main pradarshan ke prachaarkon ne striyon ko grih swamini or matra shakti ke rup main badhaava diya
 As a result, not only did women participate in the self-esteem movement in large numbers, but also the common people of Tamil Nadu developed awareness about women education

 Razia ruled the Delhi Sultanate from 1236 to 1240
 vah iltutamish kii putree thi
 Razia of Turkish origin was practiced in the leadership and administration of the army like other Muslim princesses, so that it could be used when needed
 
 razia sultanaa muslim evam turki itihaas ki pehali mahila shaasha thim
 Razia was made the Sultan of Delhi after the death of his father Shams-ud-din Iltutmish
 iltutamish, pehla aisa shaasha tha, jisane apane baad kisi mahila ko uttaradhikari niyukt kiya
 However, it was not acceptable for the Muslim class to inherit a woman from Iltutmish, so after his death his younger son Raknuddin Firoz Shah was placed on the throne
 raknuddin, kaa shashan bahut hi kam samay ke liye tha, iltutamish kii vidhwaa, shah turkan kaa shashan par niyantran nahin rah gaya tha
 The public outraged against the lax and reckless Raknuddin to the extent that Raknuddin and his mother, Shah Turkan, were assassinated on 9 November 1236
 uskaa shashan maatr chah maah kaa tha
 After this, in the absence of any other option for the Sultan, the Muslims had to give the reins of governance to a woman
 
 And Razia Sultan became the ruler of Delhi
 shashan kaaryon main razia kii ruchi apane pita ke shashan ke samay se hi thi
 After assuming the throne, Razia preferred to wear a soldier's coat and turban like men, unlike customs
 balki, baad main yuddh main bina nakaab pahane shaamil hui
 Razia renounced the purdah system and started wearing open clothes in the court like men wearing a cog razia apni raajnneetik samajhadaari or nitiyon se sena tathaa jansadharan kaa dhyaan rakhti thi
 She became the most powerful ruler of Delhi
 razia or uske salaahkaar, jamaat-ud-din-yakut, ek habshi ke saath viksit ho rahe antarang sambandh kii baat bhi musalamaanon ko pasand nahin ai
 Razia did not pay enough attention to it
 , kintu uskaa is sambandh ke parinaam ko kam aankna apane rajya ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 According to some sources, Razia and Yakut were lovers; According to other sources, they were both close friends / confidants
 is sabase razia ne turki varg main apane prati ishya ko janm de diya tha, kyonki, yakub, turk nahin tha or use razia ne ashwashaala kaa adhikari niyukt kar diya tha
 The Governor of Bathinda, Mallik ikhtiar-ud-din-altunia, revolted along with the other provincial governors, who were ruled by the ruler of Razia
 razia or altuniya ke bich yuddh hua jisamen yakut maaraa gaya or razia ko bandi bana liya gaya
 Fearing death, Razia agreed to marry Altunia
 is bich, razia ke bhai, mazuddin beharam shah, ne singhaasana hathiyaa liya
 Razia and her husband, Altunia, fought Behram Shah to defeat her Sultanate, in which she was defeated
 unhen dilli chhodkar bhaagna padaa or agle din wo kaithal panhuche, jahaan unki sena ne saath chhod diya
 On 14 October 1240, both were killed in a clash with the Jats there
 baad main beharam ko bhi ayogyata ke kaaran gaddi se hatana padaa
 The tomb of Razia Sultan and her lover Yakut, the only female ruler to rule the throne of Delhi, is claimed at three different places
 razia kii majaar ko lekar itihaaskaar ek mat nahin he
 Delhi, Kaithal and Tonk have been claiming their claim on the tomb of Razia Sultana
 lekin vaastavik majaar par abhi faisla nahin ho paaya he
 By the way, these three claims are the strongest among the claims of Razia's tomb
 in sabhi sthanon par sthit majaaron par arabi farsi main razia sultan likhe hone ke sanket to mili hai lekin thos pramaan nahin mil sake hai
 Some concrete evidence of the tomb of Razia Sultan and his Ethiopian slave Yakut has been found in Tonk, Rajasthan
 yahaan puraane kabistan ke paas ek vishaal majaar mili he jisapar farsi main ’saltane hind rajiyah’ ukera gaya he
 There is also a small tomb nearby which can be Yakut's tomb
 apni bhavyata or vishalata ke aakaar par ise sultanaa kii majaar qaraar diya gaya he
 Local historian says that there was a gap of one month between Jung and Razia's death from Bahram
 itihaaskaar is ek maah ko chook vash ullekith nahin kar paae or jang ke turant baad uski maut maan lee gai
 Whereas it was not so
 jang main haar ko saamne dekh yakuut razia ko lekar raajapootaana kii taraf nikal gaya
 He wanted to save Razia's life but eventually he was surrounded in Tonk and died here

 isse yah siddh ho jaataa he ki hindi kaa pehla upanyaas ‘devraani jethaani kii kahani‘ hi he
 It is a matter of great misfortune that even the leading Acharya of Hindi historians Ramchandra Shukla ignored it and gave the book titled 'examination Guru' of Pandit Shraddharam Phillauri's' Bhagyavati 'lala Srinivas Das in his book titled' History of Hindi Literature 'respectively' Hindi The first social novel of 'and' the first Hindi novel of English manner 'is considered
 is sambandh main yah bhi ullekhneey tathy he ki is upanyaas ke prakaashan par uttar pradesh ke tatkaaleen governor ne ‘sau rupye‘ kaa puraskaar bhi pradaan kiya tha
 Another novel called 'girija' translated by you is also notable
 pandit gauridatt ji jahaan achche gadhy-lekhak the vahaan khadi boli kavita ke kshetra main bhi aapaki pratibha adbhut thi
 a clear proof of this is found at the end of your novel titled 'devrani Jethani Ka Kahani', which was written by the then Governor of Uttar Pradesh on receipt of the award: isse yah swatah siddh ho jaataa he ki gadhy-lekhan or padya-lekhan donon hi kshetron main pandit gauridatt kaa naam sarvatha agrani or anany he
 It is a matter of happiness that the attention of some wise scholars of Hindi has gone towards this genius of Gauridutt ji and the illusion is now slowly getting removed that the first Hindi novels 'bhagyavati' and 'examination Guru' are not there
 The story of deorani-jethani is the same
 is upanyaas kaa prakaashan sarvapratham san 1870 main meerut ke ‘jian chhapekhane‘ main litho-paddati se hua tha or isaki prati ab bhi ‘neshnal librori kalakatta‘ main surakshit he
