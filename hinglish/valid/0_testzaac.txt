 According to the rules of playing the national anthem: jab raashtra gaan gaaya yaa bajaayaa jaataa he to shrotaaon ko saavdhaan kii mudra main khadey rahanaa chahie
 However, when a national anthem is played as part of a moving picture during a news activity or short film, listeners are not expected to stand up, as their standing will hamper the film's performance and cause an imbalance More confusion will arise and the dignity of the national anthem will not increase

 Because we do the same thing over and over again every time We keep expecting results but our results do not change
 So if we want to change the "results" of our lives, we have to change "work" and "work" will change only when our "thoughts" change
 There will be a change in the "financial mind", then there will be a financial change in the "society" and when our society is financially trained, then our country will also become financially strong, so that not only ours but also the economic nature of our country Will change where the situation of "financial-solution" will be created, not "financial-problem", which is just and only " "vittiya-shiksha" kaa prachaar-prasar karne kaa arth he, "logon kii vittiya samasyaon ke samaadhaan ke liye madad karnaa" !!

 But Robin Singh left Trinidad in 1984 and came to India, from here he studied in Madras from Madras University
 apni shiksha ke dauraan hi inhone kai cricket klbon main cricket match khele or yaheen se ye ek achche cricket khilaadi ban gaye

 Psychiatry or psychiatry is a specialization in the medical field that studies psychiatrists
 manovikar vigyaan aadhunik yug kaa ek naveen vigyaan he
 In the 20th century itself, discoveries of importance have been made in various parts of this science
 19veen shatabdi tak vibhinn prakaar ke manovikar aise rog maane jate the jinka saadhaaran chikitsak se koi sambandh nahin tha
 In the state of complex psychosis, the patient was kept in mental hospitals, so that he could not do any harm to other people of the society
 in chikitsaalayon main bhi uskaa koi vishesh upachaar nahin hota tha
 The doctors did not really have clear knowledge about his treatment and how to do the medicine
 ab paristhiti badal gai he
 Psychology is not considered a blind cell, which deals with a small number of demented people, but this science is considered to be a matter of such importance that a proper knowledge of it is not only for skilled physical therapists, but also every servant and worker of society, It is also necessary to be a teacher, social reformer and political leader
 itnaa hi nahin, iske gyaan kii aavashyaktaa prayek sushikshit naagarik ko bhi he
 If a strong psychologist comes to mind and we do not know it, then we will not be able to seek the help of any expert to get rid of it
 koi bhi vyakti, jo purna swasth he or jisaki buddhi kii sabhi log prashansa karte hai, apane man kaa santulan kisi samay khokar veikshipt ho saktaa he
 Then it becomes useless for the society
 manushya ko chahie ki vah aisi paristhitiyon kaa gyaan kar le jisase vah kisi prakaar kii asaadhaaran maansik avasthaa main na aa jaay, arthath maansik rog se peedit na ho jaay
 Then it is necessary to have reverence in psychiatry even for getting mental medicine
 maanav kii vishesh aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye manovikar vigyaan kaa vikaas hua
 This is the result of a special gift of the 20th century
 is shatee main manushya kii kaaryakshmata or uski sukhsamagriyon main kalpanaateet abhivruddhi hui he
 His logical power and scientific miracles have increased immensely
 iske saath saath uski maansik kriyaayein bhi pehle se kai guni bad gai he
 It is not Corey that talent and madness complement each other
 buddhivikas ke saath saath veikshiptata kaa bhi vikaas hota he
 Science increases pleasant materials, and also creates sad conditions
 vah bahya paristhitiyon ke suljhaav paidaa karne ke saath saath nai maansik ulajhanein bhi utpann kar detaa he
 On the one hand, science increases the security of human beings, on the other hand it also creates unintentional concerns
 atev yah kahana atishyokti nahin hogi ki 20veen shatabdi veikshiptata kii shatabdi he
 If it has increased insanity, then it is also the task to find special measures to mitigate it
 jo desh jitna hi sabhyataa main pragatisheel he, usamen veikshiptatanivarak chikitsak or chikitsaalay bhi utane adhik hai
 Therefore, many types of psychological discoveries are being made in various fields of anthropology for the prevention of psychosis
 doctor frid ke purv maansik rogon kii chikitsa ke liye doctor log bhautik oshadhiyon kaa hi upyog praaia: karte the
 Some people used mechanism to calm these diseases
 tantropchaar kaa aadhaar vishwaas or nirdesh rahata he
 Even today this method is mostly used in rural illiterate people
 belgium ke prasiddh monsopchaarak da mesumar ne sammohan or nirdesh kaa vyapak upyog maansik rogon ke upachaar main kiya
 Manojat physical diseases were also prevented by this
 france ke bran hime or sharako naamak vidwaanon ne sanmohan kii upyogita monsopchaar main bataai
 The patient used to relieve the mental feeling suppressed in his condition and in this type of catharsis, he also got rid of the disease
 france ke nenson ke doctor imil kuye ne maansik rogon ke upachaar main nirdesh kaa upyog kiya, parantu in sabhi vidhiyon se manovikar vigyaan kii vishesh unnati nahin hui
 For this, serious experimental study of the mind was necessary
 yah kaam doctor frid ne kiya
 Now it is believed that no person can be freed from his dementia without knowing the variations of the mind and knowing the processes going on in them
 doctor frid ke anusaar man ke teen str hai : chetan, avchetan or achetan
 The mind also performs three types of tasks: the creation of desires, their control and their satisfaction
 pehla kaam bhogashrith man kaa he, doosraa kaam naitik man kaa he or teesraa kaam ahankaar kaa he
 Desires are often born on a subconscious level, they are controlled on the subconscious and their satisfaction is on the conscious level
 manushya ke bhogecchhuk man or naitik man main praaia: sangharsh chalata rahata he
 When this struggle goes on in the human consciousness, then no matter what the cause is, it does not cause disease, but when a strong desire is suppressed by a strong will, through the moral mind, then the level of the mental consciousness But instead of being in the unconscious mind of man
 is sangharsh kaa hona hi maansik rog he or vyakti ko is sangharsh se mukt karnaa uski maansik chikitsa he, jo manovikar vigyaan kaa dhyey he
 For this, the patient is brought into a state of mental dysfunction and then he is instructed to remember his unpleasant or immoral experiences
 iske liye kuch log ab bhi sanmohan vidhi kaa upyog karte hai, parantu frid rogi kaa manovishleshan karte the
 In this method, by bringing the patient to a calm and relaxed state, all the thoughts and pictures that come to mind are asked to speak
 is prakaar kabhi kabhi rogi bahut puraane apriy anubhavon ko kah daalata he
 When those experiences become fully alive and the patient feels ashamed, guilt, joy and sadness in the same way as he did the first time, then his feelings are cathartic and many symptoms of the disease cease
 rogi kaa laabh kori bauddhik smriti se nahin hota, varan puraane anubhavon kii sajiv smriti, arthath bhavpurn smriti, se hota he
 When a repressed emotion is created, it is first charged to the mental doctor
 bhav ke baahar aane ke liye rogi kaa chikitsak ke prati sneh kaa rukh hona nitant aavashyak he
 Unless there is unity of heart between the patient and the physician, repressed desire does not come to the level of subconsciousness
 phir yah sneh din prati din badhata jaataa he
 As the patient's trust in the doctor increases, his disease decreases
 apane rog se mukt hote samay rogi chikitsak ko bahut pyaar karne lagata he
 The growth of this love and cure are two aspects of the same fact
 ab chikitsak kaa karttavya hota he ki vah rogi ke prem ke aaveg ko uske uchit paatr par mode de, athwa uskaa upyog kisi rachanaatmak kaary main karaae
 The doctor keeps trying to get the patient to get emotional composition
 vah use apane aapkaa gyaan badhaane ke liye protsaahit karata he
 The patient can be considered as disease free only if he has not only been free from all the symptoms of the disease, but has received emotional self-reliance and self-suggestion
 manovikar vigyaan isi manodasha kii prapti kaa saadhan he
 In addition to psychology, new discoveries of mental therapeutics have also taken place in other directions
 inamen se do pradhan hai : Due to the struggle going on in the mind of a mental patient, he becomes a victim of insomnia
 ab yadi aise vyakti ko kisi prakaar neend laai jaay, tab sambhav he ki uskaa rog halakaa ho jaay
 The mental patient always has to fight at two places, one inner and the other outer
 use bahari or bhitari chintaayen sataati rahati hai
 Due to this he experiences an extraordinary interruption
 isse vah apni neend kho detaa he
 Loss of sleep increases his tiredness even more and then he goes into a state of insanity
 yadi use neend aane lage, to uski maansik shakti bahut kuch sanchit ho jaay or vah apni bahari samasyaon ko hal karne main samarth ho jaay
 After this, the fierceness of his internal problems also reduces
 atev jo bhi oshadhi rogi ko neend laa de, vah use laabhprad hoti he
 For this, the Indian Ayurvedic medicine is serpagandha, or the sleeping cup made of allopathic method
 jatil maansik rogon se peedit vyakti ko kabhi kabhi achetan avasthaa main laayaa jaataa he
 For this, he is given an injection of insulin
 iske dene ke baad rogi idhar udhar chatpataata he or shaareerik anthan vyakt karata he
 On repeated injections, the patient has a tendency to rupture, beat and calm
 uskaa man shithilikaran kii avasthaa main aa jaataa he
 Then the patient naturally recovers
 isi prakaar kaa upachaar bijli ke jhatkon se bhi hota he
 By this, the patient is brought into a semi-conscious or unconscious state

 Through them, the desires of the lower class of human beings are melancholy
 iske kaaran manushya kii in ichchhaaon or naitik buddhi main sangharsh nahin hota or maansik grathiyon ke banane kaa avasar hi nahin aata
 Psychological science thus shifts our vision to those old ways of life and values prevalent in human society, due to which the human suffering has to suffer many kinds of mental afflictions
 is gyaan ke sahare saamaajik mulyon or samskruti kaa jo nirmaan hoga, vah manushya ke jivan ko sthaayee swasthya pradaan karegaa
 With this hope, this science is expanding not only by mental practitioners, but by all social welfare-thinkers

 isamen srilanka ke raajaaon kaa varnan he
 It describes the period from King Vijay of Kalinga to Sri Lanka's arrival to King Mahasen
 yah sinhal kaa prasiddh aitihaasik mahakavy he
 There is hardly any territory of India, whose history is as safe as that of Sinhala; Mahavansa is the basis of this opinion of W
 Gager
 mahaan logon ke vansh kaa parichay karaanevaala hone se tathaa swayan bhi mahaan hone se hi iskaa naam hua "mahavans" 
 This commentary book was composed by "mahanam" Sthavira

 The commander of the Dighasand was the commander of King Devanampriya Tishya
 "mahavans" paanchavin shatabdi i pus se chauthi shatabdi i tak lagbhag saadhe aath sau varshon kaa lekha he
 It included the arrival of Lanka thrice of the Tathagata, of the three Buddhist musicians, of conquering Lanka, of the arrival of Ashokaputra Mahendra to Lanka during the reign of Devanampari Tishya, of monks visiting Buddhism in countries other than Magadha and the branch of the Bodhi tree
 Including Mahendra Sthavir's sister Ashokputri Sanghamitra's description of coming to Lanka
 sinhal ke mahaparakramee raja dushtagramani se lekar mahasen tak anek raajaaon or unke rajya kaal kaa varnan he
 Thus, to say "mahavans" is only the history of Sinhala, but in fact it is filled with the original content of all Indian history
 "mahavans" kii katha mahasen ke samay tak samaapt ho jaati he
 But the writing of this "mahavans" in Sinhala Island has continued
 yah aage kaa hissaa chulvans kaha jaataa he
 "mahavansa" has ended abruptly by reaching the sixtieth saga of the thirty-seventh passage
 chhattis parichchhedon main prayek pariched ke ant main "sujanon ke prasad or vairaygy ke liye rachit mahavans kaa xxrep 6 
 pariched" shabd aate hai
 The thirty-seventh passage is incomplete
 jis rachayita ne mahavans ko aage jari rakhaa usne isi pariched main 198 gaathaayen or jodakar is pariched ko "saat raja" sheershak diya
 Every subsequent historian did not end the history of his part on a passage, but even the next passage, some of the gathas seem to have been written with the intention that this tradition of preserving ethnic history should remain intact

 The first war of Varma ended with the Treaty of Yandabu, but this treaty did not prove to be very effective in the history of Burma and ended this treaty

 It was developed as an open system non-contact enterprise
 moolbhoot rup main ye jaal sanrachana ko saat paraton main vibhajit kartaahe, upar se neeche ke kram main ye hai, anuprayog, prastutikaran, satr, yatayaat, jaal, saamagree-kadi, va bhautik parat
 Hence, it is often referred to as the "OSI seven fallow paradigm"
 har parat, saidhantik rup se samaan krityon kaa samooh he, jo apane se upar vaali parat ko seva pradaan karata he or apane se neeche vaali parat se sevaayen praapt karata he
 In each layer, an "instance" serves the instances of the top layer and requests the bottom layer to serve
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi jaal main trutiheen sampark pradaan karne vaali parat upar maujuud anuprayogon ko vaanchit path pradaan karata he or yah karne ke liye apane se nichali parat se pulindia lene-dene kaa anurodh karata he taaki path kii saamagree taiyaar ho sake
 Theoretically, two instances in a layer use a horizontal innovation connection of the same layer to interact
 oesai pratimaan kaa istemaal karne kii mukhyatah do vajah hai: Work on the layered paradigm of the mesh structure began in 1977, and the International Organization for Standardization began to structure its OSI framework
 oesai ke do mukhya tukade hai: jaal ke liye ek bhavatmak pratimaan, jise mul sandarbh pratimaan yaa saat partiya pratimaan kaha jaataa he or kuch khaas navachaar
 Note: Standard documents describing the OSI paradigm can be downloaded for free in the name of recommendations of the X
200 series of ITU-T

 The ISO / IEC standard provides the ISO equivalent to the OSI model, but not all are free
 oesai sanrachana ke sabhi aayam cycleads jaal ke saath hue anubhavon ke jariye viksit hue, isane antarjaal kii sanrachana ko bhi prabhavit kiya
 The new structure is documented in ISO 7498 and its many appendices
 is pratimaan main, jaal tantra ko paraton main baanta gaya he
 One or more entities in each layer implement the functions of the layer
 har ikai keval apane se thik neeche vaali parat se hi sidhe sampark sadhti he or apane se upar vaali parat ke istemaal ke liye suvidhaayen taiyaar va pradaan karti he
 a unit in one host uses innovations to interact with the same entity in the same layer of another host
 seva paribhaashaayen parat dwaara parat ko pradaan suvidhaon ke bare main bhavatmak varnan karti hai
 The physical layer defines the electrical and physical specifications of the devices
 yah khaastaur par kisi upkaran or bhautik madhyam ke bich ke sambandh ko paribhaashit karti he
 This includes the placement of pins, voltages, cable specifications, mesh hubs, repeaters, mesh cards, host bus adapters and more
 saamagree-kadi parat or bhautik parat main fark samajhane ke liye is baat par dhyaan den ki bhautik parat mukhyatah ek upkaran ke kisi madhyam ke saath vinirdesh se sambandhit he, jabaki saamagree-kadi parat kaa vaasta mukhyatah kai upkarnon kaa ek saajhe madhyam ke saath vinirdesh sehai
 The physical layer tells a device how to transmit something to a medium, or how to receive something from it
 ares-232 jaise maanak vastav main madhyam tak pahunch ko niyantrit karne ke liye bhautik taron kaa istemaal karte hai
 The major services and facilities provided by the physical layer are - samanaantar essiesai basen is parat ke adheen aati hai, haalaanki yah dhyaan dene yogya he ki taarkik essiesai navachaar, yatayaat parat kaa navachaar he, jo is bas ke upar chalata he
 The physical layer of Ethernet innovation is also in this layer, Ethernet comes in both this layer and the material-hardened layer

 Initially this layer was for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint mediums, which are characteristic of large area mediums in the telephone system

 WAA and LAN services - both of which create logical sequences by organizing bits from the physical layer, which are called structures
 bhautik parat kii sabhi bit dhaanchon main nahin jaati hai, kyonki kuch bit vishuddh bhautik parat ke kaamon ke liye hi hoti hai
 For example, every fifth bit of an FDDI bit stream is not used by the layer
 judaav-unmukh dablyueen saamagree judaav navachaar, dhaanchaa banane ke alaava, tratiyaan khojate hai or unhen thik bhi karat sakate hai
 They can also control the transmission rate

 jaal parat ek yaa adhik jaalon ke jariye strot se gantavy ke bich alag alag lambaai kii saamagree maala ko sthanantarit karne ke kaary sambandhi va prakriya sambandhi jariye pradaan karata he
 While doing this, the mesh layer retains the service quality requested by the traffic layer
 jaal parat jaal anumaargan kaa kaam karata he or yah vikhandan or jodne kaa kaam bhi kar saktaa he, tathaa vitaran kii trutiyon kaa byora bhi de saktaa he
 Routers operate in this layer
 ye vistrut jaal main saamagree bhej ke antarjaal ko sambhav banaate hai
 This is a logical addressing method - the values are selected by the mesh engineer
 sambodhan vidhi padanukramavaadi he
 The best example of layer 3 innovation is Internet innovation
 yah saamagree ke judaavheen sthanantaran kaa prabandhan karata he, ek baar main ek oochaal ke saath - praarambhik pranali se pravesh anumaargkat tak, phir anumaark se anumaark tak or phir baahar nikalne vaale anumaark se lakshyit antim pranali tak
 Reliable distribution until the next surge is not its responsibility, the responsibility is only to locate the error pulses so that they can be removed
 agar agle oochaal kaa madhyam maujuuda lambaai kaa pulinda nahin sweekaar saktaa he to ypi kii zimmedaari he is pulindia ko tod ke kai chote pulindia bananaa taaki madhyam inhen sweekaar sake
 Many functions of layer management innovation, as defined in the Management Appendix, ISO 7498 / 4, are part of the mesh layer
 inamen anmargan navachaar, bahu-prasaaran samooh prabandhan, jaal parat jaankaree va truti or jaal parat sambodhan namakaran shamal hai
 The function of payloads makes them members of the mesh layer, not the innovation carrying them
 yatayaat parat prayoktaaon ke bich saamagree kaa aadan pradaan karti he or upree paraton ko vishwasaneey saamagree sthanantaran sevaayen pradaan karti he
 The traffic layer controls the reliability of any link, using flow control, segmentation / partitioning and error control
 kuch navachaar sthit va judaav unmukh hai
 This means that the traffic layer can keep track of partitions and re-send them where errors occurred
 yun to ye oesai sandarbh pratimaan ke adheen nahin bane hai or na hi yatayaat parat kii oesai paribhaasha ko purnatah santusht karte hai, lekin phir bhi parat 4 ke kuch udhaaharan hai vitaran niyantran navachaar va prayokta aankadaarekh navachaar 
 There are five types of engagement-based traffic innovations in real OSI innovations - class 0 to class 4
 kaksha 0 main truti se baahar nikalne kaa koi vidhaan nahin he or isaki sanrachana aise jaal paraton ke liye kii gai thi jo trutahin judaav pradaan kar sakate hai
 Class 4 is closest to TCP, however TCP has some features that the OSI considers in the session layer such as happy ending
 saath hi sabhi oesaitipi judaav aadhaarit navachaar kakshaayen turant saamagree va abhilek simaaon kaa sangrakshan pradaan karti hai, tisipi in donon main so kuch bhi nahin kar saktaa he
 Detailed information about classes TP0-4 is in this table - shaayad yatayaat parat ke bare main sochna kaa acha tarika hoga uski daakkhaane se tulana karnaa, jo ki praapt chitthiyon ke preshan or vargeekaran kaa kaam karata he
 But remember that the post office only manages the envelope of the letter
 unche str kii paraten dohare lifaafon ko sanbhaal sakate hai, jaise ki chadmikrut prastuti sevaayen jo ki keval antim praptakarta hi vichhadmikrut kar saktaa he
 On the other hand, colorless innovations occur in the traffic layer, such as non-ip innovations - ibm's SNA or Navel's IP trap running IPX or full disguise via ipsec
 saadhaaran anumaargan ancapsulation jaal parat kaa navachaar pratithi ho saktaa he, par agar pelod kaa ancapsulen keval antabindu par hi hota he to jiaarai ypi sheershak istemaal karne vaala lekin phir bhi puure dhaanche yaa pulindia ekamusth antabindu tak pahunchaane vaala yatayaat navachaar hi ban jaataa he
 L2TP carries the PPP structure in a traffic truss
 satr parat sanganakon ke bich ke sanvaadon kaa niyantran karata he
 It establishes, manages and terminates connections between local and remote applications
 yah purna-dwaidh, ardh-dwaidh, yaa eksanketan kriya karata he or jaanch bindukaran, sthagan, samaapti va punararambh kii prakriya sthapit karata he
 The OSI paradigm has attributed this layer to a happy completion of sessions that is a feature of delivery control innovation, a function of session checking, pointing and retrieval that is not commonly found in Internet innovations
 satr parat aamtaur par un anuprayog vaataavaranon main vishisht rup se lagu hoti jinamein duurastha vidhi pukaar kaa istemaal hota he
 The presentation layer establishes context between the application layer units, so the top layer units can use different syntax and semantics, provided the rendering service is able to map between the two
 prastutikaran seva saamagree ikaayiyon ko phir satr navachaar saamagree ikaayiyon main parivartit kiya jaataa he or is tarah dher main neeche tak pahunchaaya jaataa he
 This layer relieves the discrepancy in content representation - by switching between application and mesh formats
 prastutikaran parat saamagree ko aise rup main prastut karti he jisamen anuprayog parat use sweekaar kar sake
 This layer drafting and camouflaging the material to be sent in the mesh, so that there is no problem of discrepancy
 ise aksar vaakya vinyas parat bhi kehete hai
 The original rendering framework used one of the syntactic syntax notation, which included converting an ebcdic-text file into an ASCII file, or by streaming objects into XML or vice versa
 anuprayog parat oesai kii vah parat he jo prayokta ke sabase qareeb he, arthath oesai anuprayog parat va prayokta donon hi sidhe tantransh anuprayog se sidhe sampark karte hai
 This layer interacts with software applications that implement a piece of communication
 aise anuprayog kaarykram oesai pratimaan kii seemaa ke baahar aate hai
 The application layer functions are often to identify communication partners, find the availability of resources, and contemporaryize communication
 sanchaar bhagidaaron kaa pataa lagaate samay anuprayog parat ko yah sunishchit karnaa hota he ki kisi jo anuprayog saamagree preshit karnaa chahta he uske liye sampark bhagidaar koun hai or ve uplabdh bhi hai yaa nahin
 When determining resource availability, the application layer has to decide whether sufficient network resources are available for the requested communication
 sanchaar ko samaakalin banaate, anuprayogon ke bich ke sabhi sanchaar ke liye sahyog kii zarurat hoti he jiskaa prabandan anuprayog parat karata he
 Some implemented examples of the application layer are Telnet, Advanced Text Transfer Innovation, File Transfer Innovation, and Simple Mail Transfer Innovation
 oesai sandarbh pratimaan yaa oesai navachaar main se koi bhi kisi programing antaraprishth ko nirdisht nahin karte hai
 These buses only provide emotional specifications of the service
 navachaar nirdishtataaen spasht rup se alag alag sanganakon ke bich ke antaraprisht ko spasht rup se nirdisht karte hai, lekin ek sanganak ke andar kii tantransh nirdishtataaen har karyanvayan ke liye alag alag he
 For example Microsoft Windows's Winsock and Unix's Berklee socket and System 5's traffic layer interface are the interfaces between applications and traffic
 andiaies va oriai madhyam or jaal navachaar ke bich ke antaraprishth hai
 Except for the medium from the physical layer, all other interface standards are almost exclusively implementations of OSI service specifications
 antarjaal nawacharon ke tisipi / ypi pratimaan main nawacharon ko jaanboojh ke oesai pratimaan kii tarah alag alag paraton main nahin baanta gaya he
 RFC 3439 has a department called "decomposition considered harmful"
 lekin phir bhi tisipi / ypi kaaryaklap ke aadhaar par chaar moti paraton kii pahchaan karata he, jo ki inamen nihit nawacharon ke sanchaalan ke daayre par aadhaarit he
 These scopes are stringency applications, end-to-end traffic linkage, endogenous scope, and finally the scope of direct engagement with other glands in the regional network
 yah pariklpana oesai se alag he, phir bhi isaki oesai parateekaran vidhi se aise tulana hoti he: antarjaal anuprayog parat main oesai kii anuprayog parat, prastuti parat or satr parat ke adhiktam bhaag aate hai
 The end-to-end traffic layer includes the beautiful termination feature of the OSI session layer and the OSI traffic layer
 antarjalikaran parat antarjaal parat oesai kii jaal parat kaa up-samucchy he or kadi parat main oesai jaal-kadi va bhautik paraten aati hai, saath hi oesai kii jaal parat ke bhi kai hisse isamen hai
 These layers form the basis of the original seven-layer innovation paradigm of ISO 7498, not the internal organization of a mesh layer document, etc
 oesai main graahak / upabhokta paraten kaafii sakhti ke saath varnit kii jaati hai, lekin inkaa tisipi / ypi ke maamle ke tha viradhabhas nahin he, kyonki nawacharon ke prayog ko partiya pratimaan ke padanukram kaa paalan karne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Such examples are also in some routing innovations, or in the description of tunneling innovations, providing a link layer to an application, while the tunnel host innovation may itself be a traffic or application layer
 tisipi / ypi kii sanrachana aamtaur par saralata, prabhaavshaalita va lagu karne kii saralata ke aadhaar par liye gaye faisale pasand karti he

 Whenever sinus infections occur, they also cause headaches
 parantu saare sirdard kaa kaaran sinus hi nahin hote, kai baar rogi ko sinus ke dard kii bajaay adhakapari yaa tanaav vaala sirdard ho saktaa he
 Migraine headaches affect the veins of the face
 jo ki maathe, gaalon or jabade ko jaati hai
 Because of this, there is pain near the sinuses
 jab naak va sinus kaa sankraman hota he to lakshan ankhon par, maathe par va gaalon par baaripan mahasoos hota he
 Many times, nose or nose, fatigue, fever with cold, swelling on the face and yellow or green colored fibers fall from the nose
 ise sinocitis kehete hai
 Although sometimes it is important that many headaches have been going on for a long time, due to the nose
 isliye jab kabhi migraine kaa ilaj kare to sinus sirdard ko jarur dhyaan rakhen
 In fact, there is inflammation in the sinus membrane when there is a sinus infection
 sujan ke kaaran hawa kii jagah sinus main mawaad yaa balgam aadi bhar jaataa he, jisase sinus band ho jate hai
 Because of this, pain starts on the forehead, cheeks and upper jaw and causes sinus headaches
 sirdard aage jhukne va letne se bad jaataa he
 To reduce this headache, pus and mucus are removed by reducing inflammation of the sinuses
 sinus sirdard ko kam karne ke nimr upaay hai, jaise: If the sinus headache is not cured by the above precautions etc
, a doctor should be examined so that the headache can be cured forever and if migraine is the cause of the headache, then its medicines should be treated
