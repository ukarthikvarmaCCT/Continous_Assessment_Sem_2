 kuch saptaah baad is bhaag se jaden nikal kar mitti main failane lagati hai
 Gradually there is a fear of drying up of this branch
 iske baad ise jameen se khodakar duusari jagah laga dete hai
 This method is suitable for plants like lemon, grape vine, rose, jasmine etc

 After removing the bark, placing wet soil on it, bind it with sackcloth and twine from all around
 is shakha ke thik upar ek moti shakha se ek mitti kaa bada band dete hai
 Put a thin rope around the hole in the pitcher
 is rassi ko gutti par laga dete hai
 After this, keep pouring equal amount of water in the pitcher
 pani ghade kii rassi dwaara gutti par girtaa rahata he, jissen mitti nam bani rahati hai
 After two months, when the roots come out to the surface of the sack, they separate this branch from the original tree and plant it in another place
 kuch samay baad isse puraa paudha banakar taiyaar ho jaataa he
 This method is suitable for fruit plants like orange, guava, litchi etc
 yah vidhi aam, katahal tathaa aanwala ityadi ke paudhon ke liye upyukt he
 In this method, we first prepare the plant by sowing it in a pot of seeds, when it turns 2 years old, then peel the bark of its trunk for one and a half inches and similarly peel off such a thin branch of another big tree of the same caste
 , By tying the two, bind them well
 kuch maah baad donon shakhaayen aapas main milakar ek shakha kaa rup dhaaran kar leti he
 After this, above the joint, cut the branch of the plant in the pot and separate it from the root tree of the branch of the original tree below the joint
 iske baad gamale se nikaalkar paudhe ko paudhakshetra main laga dete hai
 In this method, the properties of both the plants are exchanged, resulting in a new plant with new properties, which gives more good fruit

 According to the document of the agreement on the partition of India, the kings of the princely states had the right to choose one of the two nations, but Hari Singh, the Maharaja of Kashmir, wanted to keep his princely state independent and refrained from joining any nation
 angrejo ke bharat chhodane ke baad riyasat par riyasat par pakistani sainiko or pashtuno ke kabeelai ladaako ne hamalaa kar diya
 Fearing that the princely army would not be able to face them, the Maharaja sought military assistance from India
 bharat ne sainik sahaayta ke evaj main kashmir ke bharat main vilay kii shart rakh di
 Upon the assent of the Maharaja, India recognized this merger and made the princely state a new state in the name of Jammu and Kashmir
 bhartiya sena kii tukadiyaan turant rajya kii raksha ke liye tainaat kar di gayi
 But Pakistan disagreed on the validity of this merger
 chunki jati aadhaarit aankade uplabdh nahin the isaliye maharaj ke bharat se vilay ke peeche kya kaaran the yah tay paanaa kathin tha
 Pakistan argued that the Maharaja did not have the right to call the Indian Army because before the arrival of the British there was no post of the Maharaja of Kashmir and this post was appointed by the British only
 isaliye pakistan ne yuddh karne kaa nirnay liya par uske sena pramukh duglas greysi ne is aashay ke pakistani pradhanmantri kaa aadesh maanane se inkaar kar diya
 His reasoning was that the Indian forces occupying Kashmir were representing the British state and hence they could not fight it
 haalanki baad main pakistan ne senaayen bhej di par tab tak bharat kareeb kareeb do tihaayi kashmir par kabja kar chukaa tha This war was within the boundaries of the pre-jammu and Kashmir princely state, the Indian Army paramilitary force and the armies of the former Jammu and Kashmir princely state and the Pakistan Army paramilitary force and the tribal fighters of the North West Frontier State of Pakistan who called themselves as the Army of Azad Kashmir

 The tribal fighters of Azad Kashmir were busy in looting after the initial successes, and they proceeded to delay attacking the easily occupied new territories, and the Indian army was flown in as soon as the Maharaja agreed to merge with India

 vahaan pahunch kar unhone riyasat kii sena ko majboot kiya or srinagar ke chaaro ore rk suraksha gheraa banaaya or aaazaad kashmir sena ko haraa diya
 This security circle also included the rear-circling of the opponents by armored vehicles of the Indian Army

 He repulsed a counter-attack done on Tithwal
 poonch ghati main poonch main fasee bhartiya tukdi gheraabandi todakar kuch samay ke liye bahari duniya se waapas jud gayi
 For a long time, the contingent of the princely Kashmir state was still successful in protecting Skardu from Gilgit Scout, so the Pakistani army was not able to move towards Leh
 agast main chitral kii sena ne mata-ul-mulk ke netrutv main scardu par hamalaa kar diya or topakhane kii madad se scardu par kabja kar liya
 This led to Gilgit Scout going further towards Ladakh

 During this time the siege on Poonch continued
 ab bhartiya sena sabhi kshetron par pakistani sena or usase samarthit aaazaad kashmir sena par baari hone lagi thi
 Poonch was liberated from a year-long siege and the Indian army liberated Kargil by chasing him down after finally defeating him by the Gilgit Scout, who had been achieving good success so far, but the Indian Army was forced to attack further
 There could have been a problem of supply of logistics, so they had to stop the Pakistan Army was not expecting the tank to take the Zojila Pass with the help of tanks
 And have uprooted their feet immediately

 It is estimated that about 15-15 hundred soldiers of both sides were killed in this war
 or is yuddh ke baad bharat kaa riyasat ke saath pratishat or pakistan kaa 40 pratishat bhubhag par kabja rahaa
 The use of armored vehicles and light tanks was very important in the two phases of this war, they were used in very small numbers in both
 ye charan the These incidents suggest that the attack of armored vehicles in unlikely places puts mental pressure on the enemy
 aisa bhi ho saktaa he ki hamalaavaron ne tagerodhi hathiyaaro kaa prayog nahin kiya shaayad unhone aavashyak na jaanakar unhe peeche hi chhod diya
 The success of the use of armored vehicles left a deep impression on India's war policy
 During the war with China, the Indians worked very hard to use armored vehicles in difficult terrain, but in that war, the armored vehicles did not get the expected success

 hindi keval sahitya kii bhashaa na rahe balki jivan ke vividh kshetron main prabhavi rup se prayukt ho, tabhi iskaa vikaas sunishchit hoga
 The pleasant information is that this latest freshness of Hindi and in many contexts very new linguistic structure or newborn form has been honored by the Central Universities by including it in their courses
 prayojanamulak hindi aaj is desh main bahut bade falak or dharaatal par prayukt ho rahi he
 Today, its great role in building a bridge of dialogue between the Central and State Governments cannot be denied

 Therefore, it is necessary that it should be widely used in various application forms and on the basis of experiment, amazing problems should be solved

 Gaugamela was not far from Babylon, just 32 miles west of Arabella near Tigris
 vahaan greek or irani senaayen shakti ke antim nirnay ke liye aamane-saamne khadi hui
 The battle of Gaugamela is one of the decisive wars of the world
 misr aadi jeetne ke baad jab sikandar gaugamela ke maidan main daara kii padaav daale padi sena se lagbhag teen mile kii duuri par pahunchaa shaam kaa jhutputa ho chukaa tha
 Parmenio suggested to Alexander that the Iranians be attacked in the dark of the night, because in the daylight, seeing the number of Iranian forces counted, it is very likely that our army would suffer
 sinkadar ne uttar main usase kaha ki vah jeet churaayaa nahin karata, ladakar use sambhav karata he
 It is possible, as some historians have said, that the reason Alexander did not attack at night was in fact a technique of war which he could not use in the darkness of night
 sikandar ne aas paas ke ilaakon kaa kuch hi ghanton main kuch ghudsavaaron ke saath daura kar apni sena kaa vyuh banaaya
 Three divisions of horsemen of right and left arm phalanx were deposited
 apni haraval ke peeche usne do hamalavar stambhon ke rigerv khadey kiye, ek ek donon baajuon ke peeche, jisase peeche ke baajuon kaa todane kii koshish agar shatru kare to ye dushman par dhaave bol saken
 And if it is not needed, they can turn around and help the army
 daahine paksh ke ghudsavaaron ke saamne usne dhanurdharon or malldhariyon ko irani rathon ke saamne khadaa kiya
 According to Greek historians, Alexander's army consisted of 7 thousand cavalry and 40 thousand on foot, while the Iranian army was five times that number
 sikandar ne mauka dekhakar swayan hamalaa kiya
 He broke on the left side of the Iranians in such a way that Dara had to leave the level and move to the lower land
 daara ne jab dekha ki unchi nichi jameen par uske rath bekaar ho jaayenge tab usne baayein baaju ke ghudsavaaron ko sikandar ke daahine baaju par ghumkar hamalaa karne or use roak dene kaa hukum diya
 The cavalry on both sides sparked off
 ab daara ne rathon ko badhaayaa par ve kabhi sahi upyog main nahin laae ja sake or greek padalon ke tiron ke irani rathi shikaar hone lage
 Just then Alexander turned around and broke through the ground left by the Iranian cavalry with four divisions on the left side of the Iranians and advanced towards Darya himself
 yah hamalaa itane jor kaa hua ki daara ke paanv ukhd gaye or vah maidan chhod bhaaga
 Meanwhile, when the Iranian cavalry on the right side of Alexander saw the Macedonians attacking them from behind, they also escaped, although they suffered a lot of casualties by the enemy
 sikandar kii sena ke bich uske hamalon se jo daraar ban gai thi, iraniyon or bharatiyon ne usee kii raah sahasaa ghuskar greekon ke saamaan bhare tambuon par hamalaa kiya
 At that point, the horsemen on the right side of Dara roamed Alexander's left arm and attacked the sides of the Parmeni
 parmeniyon ne buree tarah ghir jane par sikandar ko apni bhayanak sthiti kii khabar di
 Alexander was then following the broken Iranian arm on the left
 vah ekaek apane ghudsavaaron ko liye lautaa or iraniyon ke daahine baaju par tutaa
 The Iranian cavalry now returned to flee, but when the path behind them stopped like this, then they started fighting with the enemy in front
 na unhone aap sharan maangi na shatru ko sharan di
 Alexander crushed them and an Iranian cavalryman was killed
 arbela tak sikandar kii sena daara kaa peechha karti rahi par use pakad na pai
 Dara escapes and takes refuge in Bakhtri
 arian likhata he ki teen lakh irani maare gaye jab ki sikandar ke kul ek hajaar ghudsavaar maare gaye
 It is clear that this data cannot be trusted
 issus ke yuddh ke baad yah doosraa yuddh tha jisamen iran ko haarana padaa tha or is yuddh ke baad irani samrajya took took ho gaya
 The final center of the Iranians was again established in the Valley of Vanxunad, but Alexander soon broke his last front where the independent Greek monarchy was established after Alexander's death

 War and Peace is a novel by the famous Russian writer Lev Tolstoy
 yah pehali baar 1869 main prakashit hua tha
 It is a huge work and is counted among the greatest works of world literature
 'yuddh or shaanti' kaa lekhan tolastoy ne 1863 i0 se 1869 i0 ke bich kiya
 Its publication began in 1865
 chaar khandon main prakashit is upanyaas kii prishth sankhya lagbhag dedh hajaar thi
 This large novel was conceived in about 15 different forms
 anek adhyay kai-kai baar badale gayi or naye sire se likhe gayi
 There are hundreds of characters in this novel and there are so many incidents and so many subtexts that are well connected with the main plot, that the reader is left wondering how the writer has absorbed them all with such artistic skill
 yadhyapi is viraat upanyaas kaa taana-bana bolconski, rostov or bezurov kulanaamon vaale kuleen pariwaron tathaa nepolian bonapart or samraat alexandra pratham ke samay kii ghatnaon ke ird-gird buna gaya he, tathaapi yah 19veen shatabdi ke purvarddh, bhudaason kii mukti ke pehle ke rus kaa ek jeeta jaagta chitra prastut karata he
 In this great novel, political, diplomatic, social, religious, philosophical, social, mental-emotional and psychological, etc
 No aspect or part of life has remained untouched
 is upanyaas main tolastoy ne roosi itihaas ke us kaal ko centre-bindu banaate hue yah dikhaane kaa praytn kiya he ki saadhaaran roosi logon kii deshbhakti, saahas, veerta or dridhtaa ne kaise nepolian or uski sarvatra jeet kaa danka bajaane vaali sena ke chakke chhudaa diye
 This was Tolstoy's more comprehensive view of history
 unhone yah spasht karnaa chaha he ki yuddh kaa saare samaaj, jivan ke sabhi pakshon, sabhi virgon or shreniyon ke logon par kya prabhaav padataa he
 For this reason, some of Tolstoy's scholars believe that Tolstoy in the original Russian word synonymous with peace, not Tolastoy, means peace, but the people or the whole society
 is mat ko dhyaan main rakhte hue is upanyaas kaa naam vastutah 'yuddh or shanti' nahin balki 'yuddh or samaaj' hona chahie
 'war and peace' is considered not only the world's greatest novel but a phenomenon in literary history
 yah ek sanjtil, aitihaasik-manovaigyanik, bahusanstareey mahakavyatmak kalatmak sanrachana he
 Generally, efficient synthesis of three types of materials has been done in it: - inke sahaayak pahaluon ke rup main parivaar, vivaah, striyon kii sthiti, kulinon ke nissar, janvimukh, pakhandpurn jivan aadi par tolastoy ke vichaar or maujuud sthiti kii prakhar aalochana bhi kahani ke saath hi gunthi-buni prastut hoti chalati he
 The skill with which the novel is presented in the novel, along with the detailed historical details and psychological depths, and the essayistic presentation of his ideas about history-philosophy, is unique and astonishing

 It is also a glorious Russian era monumental history in which every character is either a historical figure or similar to a bronze sculpture

 " francisi lekhak francwa moriak is upanyaas se is had tak prabhavit the ki unhone likhaa he :- "main yah nahin kah saktaa ki maine 'yuddh or shaanti' ko padhaa he
 In fact, i have been breathing for the most part of my youth among the characters of this novel

 Tolstoy's genius particularly astonishes my imagination to enliven an entire historical era in 'war and Peace', as well as the fate of Russia far beyond the boundaries of that era by the images of its characters in this novel
 Has also been echoed
 " Ernest Hemengué says - "in my eyes, there is no writer who wrote better about the war than Tolsoy
" " Thomas Mann states that "'war and peace' is the most powerful work of world literature in relation to war
 " Maxim Gorky, quoting Lenin, wrote that there is no other writer in Europe who can be compared to him

 But, as the new approach in astronomy used to say: "true we do not feel the motion of the earth, but by assuming its stability we reach unrestrained, while by assuming motion, which we do not feel, we find the rule" , - Similarly, in history, the new perspective says: "it is true that we do not feel our subordination, but by assuming our independence we reach unrestrained, whereas the outer world, time and We find rules by assuming our dependence on Ranas
 " In the first case, the problem was to deny the existence of non-existent stability and to accept the motion which we do not realize; And in this case - in the same way there is a need to deny the non-existent freedom and accept the subordination which we do not feel

 Nimbarkacharya was a famous philosopher of India who propounded the philosophy of Dvaitadvaita
 unka samay 13veen shatabdi mana jaataa he
 However, the Nimbark community believes that Nimbark was born in 3096 BC
 nimbark kaa janmasathan vartmaan andhra pradesh main he
 Nimbarkacharya, who established Shri Krishna as the soul of Sanatan culture, is considered to be the oldest among the Vaishnavacharyas
 radha-krishna kii yugalopasna ko pratishthapit karne vaale nimbarkacharya kaa pradurbhaav karthik poornima ko hua tha
 According to the belief of devotees, the emergence of Acharya Nimbarka is said to be contemporary with Krishna's great-grandson Bajranabha and Parikshit's son Janamejaya in the post-kaal period
 inke pita arun rishi kii, shrimadbhagwat main parakshit kii bhagwatakatha shravan ke prasang sahit anek sthanon par upasthiti ko vishesh rup se batalaaya gaya he
 However, modern researchers prove the period of Nimbark between Vikram's 5th century and 12th century
 sampradaay kii manyatanusaar inhen bhagwaan ke pramukh aayudh ‘sudarshan’ kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 He was born in Arunashran of Vaiduryapatna
 inke pita arun muni or inaki mata kaa naam jayanti tha
 At the time of birth, he was named Niyamanand and settled in Braj during his childhood
 manyatanusaar apane guru naarad kii ajna se niyamanand ne govardhan kii talahati ko apni sadhana-sthali banaaya
 This boy was very miraculous since childhood
 ek baar govardhan sthit inke ashram main ek divabhoji yeti aayaa
 Naturally, the scriptures were discussed but a lot of time was spent in it and it was sunset
 yeti bina bhojan kiye jane laga
 Then the child Niyamananda pointed to the neem tree and said that it is not yet sunset, you should go after eating
 lekin yeti jaise hi bhojan karke uthaa to dekha ki raatri ke do pahar biit chuke the
 Since then, this child has been named 'nimbark', that is, the person who brings out extracts on the nimbus
 nimbarkacharya ne brahmasutra, upanishad or gita par apni tikaa likhakar apana samgr darshan prastut kiya
 His commentary is famous as 'vedanta Parijat Saurabh'
 inkaa mat ‘dwaitadvait’ yaa ‘bhedabhed’ ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to Acharya Nimbark, Jeeva, Jagat and Brahma have a real estrangement relationship
 nimbark in teenon ke astitv ko unke swabhaav, gun or abhivyakti ke kaaran bhinn maanate hai to tathvik rup se ek hone ke kaaran teenon ko abhinn maanate hai
 According to Nimbark, the worshiper Radhakrishna is the only Brahman
 dosarvapalli radhakrishnan ne apni suvikhyath pustak ‘bhartiya darshan’ main nimbark or unke vedant darshan kii charchaa karte hue likhaa he ki nimbark kii drushti main bhakthi kaa taatpary upasna na hokar prem anuraag he
 The Lord is always present for the benefit of his devoted devotee
 bhaktiyukt karm hi brahmagyaan prapti kaa saadhan he
 Nimbarka Jayanti special celebrations are celebrated in various parts of India including Radhamadhav Temple in Salemabad, nimbark-kot of Vrindavan, Neemgaon
 higgs boson ek mul kan he jisaki pratham pariklpana 1964 main di gai or iskaa praayogic satyaapan 14 march 2013 ko kiya gaya
 The invention was called a 'memoir' because it confirmed the Higgs field
 kan bhautikee ke maanak model dwaara iske astitv kaa anumaan lagaaya gaya he
 Till the present time, there is no knowledge of any such type of particle
 higgs boson ko kano ke dravyaman yaa bhaar ke liye jimmedaar mana jaataa he
 It is often considered to be the last fundamental particle
 is moolbhoot kan kaa naam mukhyatah higgs boson naamak kan or higgs kshetra naamak kshetra se judaa hua he
 For some time this particle was created by combining the names of three scientists who are the authors of the first PRL paper related to this particle, for example the Brut – Angleya – Higgs particle, the Anderson – Higgs particle or the Angleya – Brut – Higgs particle
 The Guralnik – Kibble process or the "anderson – Higgs" process, the "higgs – Kibble" process and the "ABEGHHK'TH" process higgs kan ko vaigyanik samudaay ke baahar or media dwaara aksar "ishwariya kan" se sandarbhit kiya jaataa he
 The surname was derived from Fermilab's former director, Nobel Prize winner Leon Lederman's 1993 book on Higgs Particle and Particle Physics, which he wrote about the US government halting the construction of the Superconducting Super Collider, which was almost built Was

 Higgs, who is an atheist, found it "embarrassing" to call it a "god particle" and expressed unhappiness, saying in a 2008 interview, "this is abuse of it" and said, " xxrep 4

 The International Organization for Standardization, often called the ISO, is an international standards-making body composed of representatives of standards organizations of various nations
 isaki sthapana 23 farvari, 1947 ko hui thi, vishwavyaapee audyogic evam vanijyik maanakon ko ghoshit karne hetu
 Its headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland
 yadhyapi ISO swayan ko ek gaiyr sarkari sanghathan kahata he, isaki maanak sthapit karne kii kshamta, jo ki praay vidhi ban jate hai, yaa to samjhauton ke dwaara, yaa phir rashtriya maan; yah isko gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon se adhik shaktishaalee banaata he
 In practice, it is working like a faculty or short-term organization, which has strong links with governments
 
 The logo or symbol of this organization is American English and French in two official languages
 isamen ISO akshar bhi sammilit hai, jinase yah praayah janaa jaataa he, jo ki isaki sankshipti he
 Rather this abbreviation is derived from the Greek / Greek word ἴσος, which means equal
 yah maanate hue ki sanghathan kaa bhinn bhashaaon main bhinn sankshipti banegi, yah tay kiya ki ek sarvyaapee sarvamaanya naam ISO hi chalaaya jaae
 This in itself proves the purpose of this organization
 ISO ke mukhya utpaada hai anterrashtriya maanak
 Only published by ISO are: Technical Reports, Technical Specialization, Publicly Available Specialties, Technical Corrigendum, and and Guide
 anterrashtriya maanak kaa roopakar hota he ISO xxrep 5 n sheershak, jahaan xxrep 5 n he maanak sankhya, xxrep 4 y he prakaashan kaa varsh, evam sheershak bataata he vishay
 yadi maanak sanyukt takneekee samiti JTC1 ke kaary kaa parinaam he, to IEC bhi sammilit kiya jaataa he
 ASTM is also incorporated into standards developed in collaboration with ASTM International
 dinaak evam IS kaa prayog apurna yaa aprakashit maanakon ke liye aprayogneey he, evam kuch paristhitiyon main prakashit kaary kaa sheershak bhi chhona ja saktaa he
 a technical report is issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has generally collected data of a different type from the published international standard, such as references or interpretations
 inaki namakaran pratha maanakon kii bhaanti hi he, keval TR lagaaya jaataa he IS ke sthaan par, report ke naam se pehle
 For example takneekee vishesheekaran ko tab rachit kiya ja saktaa he, jabaki "sambandhit vishay abhi bhi vikaas kii sthiti main hi he, yaa kisi anya karanvash bhavishya main kisi anterrashtriya maanak ko prakashit karne kii sahmati kii sambhaavna hoti he" 
 Publicly available specialties can be an "intermediate specialization that has been published prior to the development of the full international standard", or, a 'bicameral' publication in the IEC, published in collaboration with an external organization
 " Naming is done like a technical report
 udhaahrantah ISO sometimes also issues technical / technical corrigendum
 ye vartmaan maanakon ke sanshodhan hote hai, jo ki kshudra takneekee / paribhaashik trutiyon, prayogneeyata sudhaar yaa simit tareeke se prayojyata badhaane hetu kiye jate hai
 Often these are issued with the hope that the affected standard will be either quoted or withdrawn until their next scheduling overview
 ISO path-pradarshak ardh-maanak hote hai, anterrashtriya maanakeekaran se sambandhit vishyon ko liye hue
 These are named in the "ISO Guide N: xxrep 4 y : title", eg ISO pralekh prakashnadhikaar surakshit hote hai, evam ISO adhiktar kii pratiyon kaa mulya letaa he
 However, most of the values are taken only in electronic form

 Some standards are provided free of charge by ISO and its official United States Representative and International Electrotechnical Commission
 ISO ke 157 rashtriya sadsy hai, out of the 195 total countries in the world
 ISO has three membership categories: bhagidaar sadsy "P" yaa pi sadsy kehalaate hai, jabaki anupaalan karne vaale "O" yaa o sadsy kehalaate hai
 The fact that many iso-created standards are universal, ubiquitous; On many occasions, the general use of "ISO" has been inspired to describe a product that conforms to the standards
 iske kai udhaaharan hai: To deal with the consequences of abundant coverage in the areas of standardization, and the tasks related to information technology; a Joint Technical Committee constituted from ISO & IEC or International Electrotechnical Commission known as ISO / IEC JTC1
 yah asi pratham samiti he, evam ajtak ek hi he
 Its official order is to develop, maintain, promote IT standards for business and user requirements in worldwide markets
 vartmaan main 18 up-samitiyaan hai :- Membership of ISO / IEC JTC1 is restricted to the same extent as that of its parent organizations
 ek sadsy yaa to bhagidaar yaa prekshak ho saktaa he
 The only difference between the proposed standards and other products is the ability to vote
 kisi sadsy sanstha ke liye kisi yaa prayek up-samiti par str / raay banaae rakhane kii, koi aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Occasionally, sub-committees may be formed, or even dissolved, to cope with new situations if their area of work is no longer in force
 ISO / TS jaise, antarrashtriya kaaryshaala samjhauta International Workshop Agreement bhi ISO kaa ek or shastraagaar he, jo ki un kshetron main, jahaan takneekee sanrachana evam nipunata abhi nahin pahaunchi he; vahaan maanakeekaran kii aavashyaktaaon par twarit pratikriya uplabdh karaata he

 Before independence and partition in 1947, there were a total of 565 independent princely states, which were not a part of British India, apart from the British-ruled territory in India
 ye riyaasaten bhartiya upmahadweep ke wo kshetra the, jahaan par angrezon kaa pratyaksh rup se shashan nahin tha, balki ye riyasat sandhi dwaara british raaj ke prabhutv ke adheen the
 The terms of these treaties were different for every princely state, but basically under every treaty, the princely states had to take the permission of the British on matters related to foreign affairs, relations and agreements with other princely states and the army and security
 The British rule was directly on the British and in return the British government allowed the rulers to rule independently

 The British government used to appoint a permanent officer for each state, who was called a resident
 "racident " ek rajanyik paddati thi jo rajavaadon main british sarkaar ke duuton ko diya jaataa tha
 The Resident was an advisor appointed by the British Government whose job was to represent the British Government in the princely states and to put British interests before the rulers

 These groups were called "agency" like "rajputana Agency", "central India Agency" and "baluchistan Agency"

 In 1920, "narendra Mandal" was established to represent the princely states, which was a platform for the rulers to present their hopes and aspirations to the British government
 iski baithak "sansad bhawan" ke central haal main hoti thi
 It was displaced in 1947

 bharat main koyale ke khanan kaa itihaas bahut purana he
 The British East India Company started commercial mining of coal at Raniganj on the western bank of the Damodar River in 1774
 iske baad lagbhag ek shatabdi tak khanan kaa kaary apekshaakrit dhimi gati se chalata rahaa kyonki koyale kii maang bahut kam thi
 But with the introduction of steam trains in 1853, the demand for coal increased and mining was encouraged
 iske baad koyale kaa utpaadan lagbhag 1 million metric ton prati varsh ho gaya
 By the end of the 19th century, production in India had become 6
12 million tonnes per annum
 or 1920 tak 18 million metric ton vaarshik
 Production increased at the time of the First World War, but again in the early 1930s production decreased
 1942 tak utpaadan 29 million metric ton prativarsh tathaa 1946 tak 30 million metric ton ho gaya
 The Government of India decided to nationalize India's private coal mines and completed it in two phases
 pehle kokekar koyala khaanon kaa 1971-72 main rashtriyakaran kiya gaya or 1973 main akokkar koyala khaanon kaa
 The Kokkar Coal Mines Act, 1971, in October 1971, provided for taking over the management of coking mines and coke oven plants in the public interest till nationalization
 iske baad kokekar koyala khan adhinium, 1972 banaaya gaya jiske antargat tata aayran and steel company li
 or indian aayran and steel company li
 ke niyantran se bhinn kokekar koyala khaanon or coke oven sanyantron kaa 1-5-1972 ko rashtriyakaran kiya gaya or inako kendra sarkaar ke naye upkram bharat koking kol li
 ke adheen kar diya gaya
 Another Act called the Coal Mines Act, 1973 empowered the Government of India to take over the management of the Kokkar and Akokkar coal mines located in seven states, including the Kokkar coal mines, taken over by them in 1971
 iske baad koyala khan adhinium, 1973 ke banane se 1-5-1973 ko in sabhi khaanon kaa rashtriyakaran kar diya gaya
 The reason for nationalization was stated that private coal mine owners were not investing enough capital to meet the growing energy requirements of the country
 unamem se kuch maalikon dwaara apanaae gaye avaigyanik khanan tareekon or kuch nijee koyala khaanon main mazdooron kii kharaab kaary-sthiti sarkaar ke liye chintaa ke vishay ban gaye the
 The nationalization of the coal industry in India is the result of two related events in the early 1970s
 pehle udhaaharan main tel kii keemat kaa sadma, jisane desh ko apni urja vikalpon kii khoj karne ke liye baadhya kar diya tha
 Secondly, the development of the region required considerable investment which could not come from coal mining as it was mostly in the hands of the private sector

 This change redistributes economic surpluses from producers and consumers and can have negative implications for rural communities
 fasal parivartan kii pratha, maanav ke dwaara hajaaron saalon se, sabhyataa kii shuruyaat se hi apanaayi ja rahi he, Crop changes through reproductive processes alter the genetic structure of a plant, causing a crop with traits that are more beneficial to humans, for example large fruits or seeds, tolerance to drought and resistance to pests
 
 jin vigyaani grigore mendal ke kaary ke baad padap prajnan main mahatvapurn unnati hui
 His work on effective and ineffective alleles gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics
 or isse padap prajnakon ke dwaara prayukt takneekon ko mahaan antardrushti praapt hui
 Crop breeding includes techniques such as self-pollination, cross-pollination and selection of plants with desired properties, and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism

 Precautionary selection and breeding have heavily influenced the characteristics of crop plants
 1920 or 1930 ke dashak main, paudhon ke chayan or prajnan ne, newjiland main charaagahon main kaaphi sudhaar kiya
 The mutagenic effect induced by an ultraviolet widespread X-ray during the 1950s produced modern varieties of grains such as wheat, corn and barley
 harith kranti ne "ucch-utpaadakta kii kismon" ke nirmaan ke dwaara utpaadan ko kai guna badhaane ke liye paaramparik sankaran ke upyog ko lokapriy bana diya
 For example, the average yield of corn in the United States was 2 in 1900
 5 ton prati hectare se badhkar 2001 main 9
 4 tons per hectare
 isi tarah duniya kii ausat genhu kii paidaavaar 1900 main 1 ton prati hectare se bad kar 1990 main 2

 sinchai ke saath dakshin america kii ausat gehun kii paidaavaar lagbhag 2 ton prati hectare he, africa kii 1 ton prati hectare se kam he, misr or arab kii 3
 Ranges from 5 to 4 tons per hectare
 iske vipareet, frans jaise deshon main genhu kii paidaavaar 8 ton prati hectare se adhik he
 These variations in yields are mainly due to variations in the level of climate, genetics and intensive farming techniques
 anuvaanshik rup se parishkrut jeev ve jeev hai jinke anuvanshik padaarth ko anuvanshik abhiyantriki takanic ke dwaara badal diya gaya he, ise saamanyatya punah sanyojak DNA praudyogiki ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Genetic engineering has provided more genes to breeders, using which they can build the desired gene structure for new crops
 1960 ke prarambh main yantric tamaato -harvester ke vikaas ke baad, krishi vigyaniyon ne tamaato kii yantric sambhaal hetu ise adhik sanshodhit banane ke liye anuvanshik rup se parishkrut kiya
 More recently, genetic engineering is being used in different parts of the world to produce crops with better characteristics
 rounssop ready beej main ek shaak pratirodhi jin hota he, jo paudhe main glifoset ke prati sahansheeltaa ke liye iske jinom main daal diya gaya he
 Roundup is a trade name given to a glyphosate-based product, which is artificial and an undeclared herbicide used to destroy weeds
 rounssop ready beej kisaan ko ansi fasal detaa he jis par khar patavaar nasht karne ke liye glifoset kaa chhidkav kiya ja saktaa he or pratirodhi fasal ko koi nuksaan nahin pahunchataa he
 Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers around the world
 aaj, america main soyabean kaa 92% bhaag anuvanshik rup se sanshodhit shaak vinashi-sahishnu paudhon ke saath ugaaya jaataa he
 With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, the use of glyphosate-based herbicide spraying has increased
 kuch kshetron main glifoset virdohi kharpatvaar viksit ho gaye hai, jiske kaaran kisaanon ne kisi anya shaak vinashi kaa prayog karnaa shuru kar diya he
 Some studies correlate excessive use of glyphosate with iron deficiency in some crops, which is a topic of considerable consideration both in terms of economic potential and health implications, both crop production and nutritional quality

 In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistant traits; Some tomato crops that have acquired immunity to at least nineteen diseases have done so through hybridization with wild species of tomatoes
 anuvanshik engeenior kisi din aise transgenic paudhon ko viksit kar sakate hai, jo sinchai, jal nikasi, sangrakshan, swatchta ejineering or utpaadan ko badhaane yaa banaaye rakhane main sakasham honge or paaramparik fasal kii tulana main unki jeevashm eendhan vyutpann nivesh kii aavashyaktaa kam hogi
 Such developments will be especially important in areas that are generally dry and rely on continuous irrigation and are rich in large-scale fields
 haalanki, paudhon kii anuvanshik abhiyantriki vivaadaaspad sabit hui he
 Many issues related to GMO practices have arisen regarding food safety and environmental impacts
 udhaaharan ke liye, kuch paryaavaran vigyaani or arthshaastri GMO prathaon jaise termineter beej ke sambandh main gmos par prashn uthaate hai
 Which is a genetic modification that produces infertile seeds
 vartmaan main antarrashtriya str par termineter beej kaa bahut adhik virodh kiya ja rahaa he or is par vishwa stareey roak lagaaye jane ke liye nirantar prayaas kiye ja rahe hai
 Another controversial issue is patent protection for companies that grow new types of seeds using genetic engineering
 chunki companiyon ke paas apane beej kaa bauddhik swaamitv he, unke paas apane patent utpaada kii sharten or niyam lagu karne kaa adhikaar he
 Currently, ten seed companies control more than two-thirds of the world's seed sales
 vandana shiv kaa tark he ki ye companiyaan laabh ke liye jeev kaa shoshan karne or jivan ke patent ke dwaara jaev piresi ke doshi hai
 Farmers using patent seeds cannot save the seed for the next crop, forcing them to buy new seeds every year
 chunki viksit or vikaas sheel donon prakaar ke deshon main beej ko bachaana kai kisaanon ke liye ek paaramparik pratha he, GMO beej kisaanon ko beej bachaane kii is pratha ko parivartit karne or har saal nae beej kharidne ke liye baadhya karte hai
 Locally adapted seeds are also capable, just like present hybrid seeds and gmos
 sthaneey rup se anukulit beej, jo bhoomi prajati yaa fasal paristhitik-prakaar bhi kehalaate hai, ve mahatvapurn hai kyonki samay ke saath ve jutai ke kshetra ke vishesh sookshm vaataavaran, mrudaa, anya paryaavarni paristhitiyon, kshetra ke dizin or jaateey variyata ke liye anukulit ho jate hai
 Bringing gmos and hybridized commercial seeds into an area also poses a risk of pollination with local species, therefore, gmos are a threat to land species and traditional ethnic heritage
 ek baar beej main jab transgenic saamagree shaamil ho jaati he, yah us beej company ke ko sharton ke adheen bana detaa he, jiske paas transgenic saamagree kaa patent he
 There is also the issue that gmos cross-pollinate with wild species and permanently alter the heredity of native populations; Several wild plants have been identified in which transgenic genes have been found
 GMO jin kaa sambandhit khar-patavaar prajati main chalaa janaa bhi ek chintaa kaa vishay he, aisa bhi gaiyr transgenic fasal ke saath par paragan ke dwaara hi hota he
 Since many GMO crops are harvested for their seeds, such as rapeseed, there is a problem of seed spillage during volunteer transport for volunteer plants in transportation and on recurring fields
 khaadya raksha ke mudde bhi sanyogvash khaadya suraksha or khaadya labling ke muddon se mail khate hai
 Currently a world treaty, the Bio Safety Protocol, regulates the trade of gmos
 vartmaan main EU ke liye sabhi GMO khaadya padaarthon ko label karnaa jaruri he, jabaki US main GMO khaadya padaarthon kii paardarshak labling jaruri nahin he
 So there are many questions on the risks and safety issues related to GMO foods, some people believe that the public should have the right to choose foods for themselves, must know what she is eating and for all GMO products Must be labeled
 krishi, kitnashkon, poshakon ke risaav, atirikt jal upyog or anya mishrit samasyaon ke dwaara samaaj par kai bahari kharche adhyaropit karti he An assessment on agriculture in Britain in 2000 showed that the total external cost for 1996 was 2343 million British pounds, or 208 pounds per hectare
 sanyukt rajya main 2005 ke ek vishleshan main nishkarsh nikaala gaya ki fasal bhoomi lagbhag 5-16 billian dollar adhyaropit karti he, jabaki pashudhan utpaadan 714 million dollar adhyaropit karata he
 Both studies conclude that more work should be done to reduce external costs, this analysis did not include their subsidies, but noted that subsidies also impact society in terms of the cost of agriculture

 Modern or industrial agriculture depends on petroleum in two fundamental ways: 1) Cultivation - harvesting and harvesting from seed
 2) parivahan-kataai karke upabhokta ke frij tak pahunchaana
 In this process, about 400 gallons of oil per citizen per year is used to provide fuel to tractors and equipment used for tillage

 Some of these shortcomings resulted in food riots and a stampede
 krishi kshetra main ek anya pramukh petroleum mudda he petroleum aapurti kaa prabhaav urvarak utpaadan par padegaa
 The highest input of fossil fuels in agriculture is the use of natural gas as a hydrogen source for the haber-bosch fertilizer manufacturing process, natural gas is used because it is the cheapest source of hydrogen currently available
 jab tel kaa utpaadan bahut kam ho jaataa he tab praakrit gas ko iske vikalp ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 And as the use of hydrogen increases in transportation, natural gas will become more expensive
 yadi habar prakriya ko navyakaraniya urja kaa upyog karte hue vanijikrut nahin kiya ja saktaa yaa yadi habar prakriya ko pratisthapit karne ke liye hydrogen ke anya strot itani maatra main uplabdh nahin hai, ki ve parivahan or krishi kii aavashyaktaa ke liye paryaapt hon, to urvarak kaa yah mukhya strot yaa to bahut adhik mahangaa ho jaayegaa yaa uplabdh nahin hoga
 This will either bring down food shortages or dramatically increase food prices
