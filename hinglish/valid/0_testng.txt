 The legal basis for this federation was the British Caribbean Union Act 1956 and the date of formation - 3 January 1958 - was established by an order-in-council announced in 1957

 pehle sangheey chunaav kii taiyaar ke liye, sthaneey raajnneetik dalon ke parisangh ke rup main do mahasangheey-vyapak partiyon ko yojit kiya gaya
 Both were organized by Jamaican leaders: the Federal Labor Party of the West Indies by Norman Manley and the Democratic Labor Party by Alexander Bustamante
 vyapak sandarbh main, dabluelpi, puure sangh main shahari aadhaarit partiyon se bana tha, jabaki dlapi main gramin aadhaarit partiyaan shaamil thim
 a small third party, the Federal Democratic Party, was founded in November 1957 by a group in Trinidad, although the party failed to win a single seat
 donon pramukh rashtriya dalon ke liye kai minon main platform samaan the
 Both advocated maintaining and strengthening ties with the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada: the emphasis on encouraging and expanding tourism; In order to obtain loans, for financial assistance and technical assistance, insisted on trying to bring British Guiana and British Honduras into the Union
 in samaantaaon ke baavjood, vahaan kaaphi matbhed the
 The WIFLP advocated the promotion of agriculture, while the DLP promised a favorable climate for both private industry and the development of labor, human and economic resources
 dabluelpi ne bahama ko sangh main shaamil hone ke liye protsaahit karne kaa vaada kiya, jabaki dlapi ne nahin kiya
 The WIFLP also campaigned for the establishment of a central bank to expand credit resources and advocated complete internal self-government for a democratic socialist society and all unit territories, while avoiding issues of the independence movement and a custom union
 dlapi ne purna aantarik swashaasan ke bare main kuch nahin kaha, par samaajwaad par hamalaa kiya, ucch karadhaan se bachane kii koshish kii or west indies kii ekta kii kaamana kii, puja kii swatantraaa or abhivyakti or trade unionon ke protsaahan par bal diya
 a federal election was held on March 25, 1958

 The WIFLP received the bulk of the seats from the smaller islands, while the DLP received a majority in Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago
 dlapi ne jamaica main 11 siton or trinidad main 6 siton main jeet hasil kii
 While appointing the Senate, the Governor General Lord Hales realized that only the St
 Vincent Island government was controlled by the DLP, with the result that the Senate was going to the disproportionately WIFLP
 ek vivaadaaspad faisle main unhone jamaica or trinidad main vipaksh dlapi samoohon se sampark kiya or un dwipon main se prayek se ek dlapi seenetter niyukt kiya he
 Thus the Senate consisted of 15 WIFLP members and 4 DLP members

 But both did not contest the federal election and preferred to retain control of their respective island
 iskaa arth yah tha ki do sabase mahatvapurn praanton ke netaaon ne sangh ko vyavhaarya ke rup main nahin dekha
 Similarly, Jamaican founder Alexander Bustamante of DLP also declined to contest the union and left the party leadership for Trinidadian Ashford Sinanan

 The federal structure of the West Indies Union was unusually weak
 udhaaharan ke liye, iske praant ek ekal custom union main shaamil nahin the
 Thus, each province was acting as a separate economy with tariffs, mainly because smaller provinces were afraid of being overwhelmed by the economies of the larger island
 iske alaava, sangh ke bheetar andolan kii puri swatantraaa ko lagu nahin kiya gaya, kyonki bade praant chote dwipon se bade paimaane par palaayan ke bare main chintit the
 In this sense, it can be said that the current European Union has implemented a more integrated economic environment than the West Indian effort
 or na hi sangheey sarkaar kaary karne ke liye apane ghatak rajyon ko laa pai
 The initial federal budget was quite small, which restricted the federal government from using its financial generosity as a carrot
 vah united kingdom or apane sadsy deshon ke anudaan par nirbhar tha
 The provincial budgets of Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago were both larger than the federal budget
 iske chalate un rajyon se sangheey sarkaar ke liye adhik se adhik vitt poshan pradaan ke anurodhon ko doharaaya gaya
 These requests were ignored because both Jamaica and Trinidad & Tobago had already contributed about 85 percent of federal revenue, roughly in equal parts
 iske alaava, pradhanmantri kaa pad kaaphi kamjor tha
 Unlike other Westminster systems with the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of the West Indian Union could not dissolve Parliament
 vishesh rup se sangh ne canada ke saath kareebi sambandhon ko banaae rakhaa tha, jiskaa ateet bhi is rup main samaan tha ki vah kai purv british upniveshon kaa ek mahasang tha
 In the early years, many Caribbean leaders suggested that the West Indies Union should investigate the possibility of becoming a Canadian province, though it was never more than a fleeting one
 vaarta ke khandit hone ke baavjood, may 1961 main canada ne kshetra ke do sabase mahatvapurn uphaar ko westeindies sangh ko prastut kiya: do vyapaaree jahaaj, jiskaa naam da fedral palm or ga fedral mapel tha
 These two ships visited each island twice a month in the federation and provided an important maritime contact between the islands
 sangh ke samaapt hone ke liye kai kaarnon ko ginaya gaya he, unamem se kuch ko upar "samasya" anubhag main vistaar se bataaya gaya he
 This included lack of local public support, competitive insular nationalism, weakness of federal government, curb on federal taxation and freedom of movement, lack of federal constitution, fundamental changes to constitution at the beginning of its existence, political quarrels among influential leaders
 , The three most influential leaders decide not to participate in the federal election, the two largest units are Population and Resources The impact of heavy concentration, geographic and cultural distance between the units, lack of history of public administration and self-state period s who was standing by the Crown Colony system
 haalaanki, sangh ke vighatan ke liye tatkaal utprerak jamcon asantosh tha
 By 1961, Jamaica had a number of reasons for dissatisfaction with the state of affairs: jamaica ke asantusht hone kaa sabase mahatvapurn kaaran sangh kii aupniveshik sthiti kaa jari rahanaa tha
 Jamaica joined the Union because its leaders believed that the West Indies would soon be given independence
 sangh ke gathan ke lagbhag teen saal baad bhi aisa nahin hua tha, isi bich, chote british upnivesh jaise cyprus or siyara leone ne swatantraaa praapt kar lee thi
 Thus, many Jamaicans believed that the island should seek independence from its authority and this could happen
 saath hi sangh dwaara prastaavit rajdhani chaugaaramasa ke saath bhi samasyaayein thi, us samay vah sanyukt rajya ke haathon main tha 
 Many leaders of the Caribbean province wanted Chaguramas as the capital of the Confederacy
 kshetreey netaa jaise, jamaica ke norman manale or dow erik williams ne chaugaaramas ko sanyukt rajya se chhudaa kar sangh ko saunpe jane kii vakaalat kii
 However, the United States and Britain disagreed, and the Prime Minister of the Federation, Grantley Adams, refused provincial leaders to obtain Chaugaramas
 kai jamikans ko tab laga ki sangh unki vikaas prakriya or swatantraaa andolan ko baadhit kar rahaa he
 As a result, the Jamaican Labor Party, led by Bustamante, successfully forced Manley to hold a referendum in September 1961 over political isolation from the Union
 us samay ke prantiy pradhanmantri manale ke virodh ke baavjood, 54 pratishat vot ke saath ise paarit kar diya gaya
 Manley himself was defeated in the island elections of April 1962 and Bustamante became the first Prime Minister of independent Jamaica on 6 August 1962
 jamaica ke jane ke baad, puraane malbe se ek nayaa mahasang khadaa karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 For this, there was considerable reliance on Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, who said in the past that he wanted a "strong union"
 antigua ke pradhanmantri ware bird ne jawaab diya ki sangh main unka praant trinidad ke baraabar kaa hissedaar he, "ek chote se tobago" kii tarah nahi he
 He indicated that a strong federation was acceptable provided no attempt was made to create a unitary state
 is nae sangh par vaarta sitambar 1961 main shuru hui; haalaanki, unhone sanket diya ki trinidad ko 75 se 80 pratishat tak nae mahasang kaa rajasav pradaan karnaa hoga
 Furthermore, even though Trinidad now represents 60 percent of the new union's population, the resolution under consideration had to be given less than half the seats in Parliament
 november tak, williams ne sanket diya ki ab vah ek ekaatmak rajya banane ke vichaar ke paksh main he
 Failing that, he resolved to take independence to Trinidad and Tobago
 jiske tahat 4 disambar 1961 ko unhen ek trinidadian netaa ke rup punarnirvachan dwaara simit kiya gaya
 Later in December, Barbados Prime Minister Errol Barrow met with Williams, but failed to persuade him to keep Trinidad in the Union
 14 janvari,1962 ko naishanal pipuls movement ne sangh ke saath kisi bhi aage kii bhagidaari ko khaarij karne ke prastaav ko paarit kiya
 Williams himself stated that "if we remove one out of ten, only zero remains" In other words, without Jamaica, union was not possible
 trinidad or tobago ko 31 agast 1962 ko swatantraaa mili
 Without Trinidad and Jamaica, the remaining "little Eight" attempted to retain some form of West Indies union, this time focused on Barbados
 haalaanki, ye vaartaayen antat nirarthak sabit hui
 Without its two largest states, the Union was ruined by financial bankruptcy
 barbados is samay vittiya boj ko apane kandhe par uthaane se inkaar kar diya or antigua or grenada kramshah jamaica or trinidad ke saath vilay karne ke vichaar ke saath dilchaspee lenaa shuru kiya

 All three also remain British territories

 Officially built before the Union, another permanent regional construction is the University of the West Indies

 ek harfanmaulaa aisa cricket khilaadi he jo niyamit taur par ballebaaji or gendbaaji donon main acha pradarshan karata he
 Although batting is essential for all bowlers and some batsmen also bowl occasionally, most players are proficient in only one of these two things and are considered experts
 kuch wicket-kiparon main visheshgy ballebaajon kii nipunata hoti he or ve bhi harfanmaulaa kahe jate hai, lekin unke liye wicket-keeper ballebaaj shabdaawalee kaa zyada istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The greatest all-rounders include George Hurst, Wilfred Rods, Mushtaq Mohammed, Keith Miller, Garfield Sobers, Andrew Flintoff, Walter Hammond, Ian Botham, Jacques Kallis, Kapil Dev, Richard Hadley, W

 G
 Grace, Chris Cairns, Shane Watson, Dwayne Bravo, Imran Khan and Shahid Afridi can be named
 vaise kisi khilaadi ke liye aisi koi sateek yogyata nahin he jiske aadhaar par use harfanmaulaa mana jaae or is naam kaa prayog vyaktiparak ho jaataa he
 It is usually called a 'real all-rounder' who has such a batting or bowling ability so that he is able to make a place in one of the teams for which he plays
 'vaastavik harfanmaulaa' kii ek or paribhaasha ye hai ki ek aisa khilaadi jo apni ballebaaji or gendbaaji se, lagaataar apane "dal ke liye match jeetne main madad kare" 
 By definition, a real all-rounder is an extremely rare and highly valuable player for a team as it effectively serves as two players
 kabhi-kabhi bhram kii sthiti paidaa ho jaati he jab ek visheshgy gendbaaj balle se acha pradarshan karata he
 For example, the great West Indian fast bowler Malcolm Marshall used to play good innings many times, but it was not so often that he was considered an all-rounder
 Instead, he can be called a good batsman of the lower order
 isi tarah ek visheshgy ballebaaj ko upyogi badlaav kaa gendbaaj kaha ja saktaa he or iske ek achche udhaaharan alan border hai jinhone 1989 main ek baar ek test match main tab 11 wicket liye, jab paristhitiyaan unke baayen haath kii phiraki gendbaaji ke anukool thim
 One of the major obstacles to becoming a recognized all-rounder is the arrival of batsmen and bowlers at different ages
 Bats reach their peak around thirty years of age when they mature with technical experience

 aankadon kaa ek saamaanya par istemaal kiya jane vaala niyam yah he ki khilaadi kaa ballebaaji ausat uske gendbaaji ausat se zyada hona chahie
 In Test cricket, there are only three all-rounders whose batting average is twenty points more than their bowling average: Garfield Sobers, Jacques Kallis and Walter Hammond
 However, there are other players who achieved this feat for a large part of their careers, such as Imran Khan, Steve Waugh, Andrew Symonds and Shane Watson
 Duff Walters achieved a difference of nearly twenty runs in his batting and bowling average from batting average of 48
26 and bowling average of 29
08, despite that he was generally considered to be an occasional bowler and partnership breaker, not a real all-rounder

 Fielding skills are considered to be another important basis of a player's all-round ability

 mulat: ek harfanmaulaa, ballebaaji kii apeksha gendbaaji main behatar hota he, isi tarah gendbaaji kii apeksha ballebaaji main behatar hota he
 There are very few who are good at both and perhaps none at all who are better at both
 yahi vajah he ki "gendbaaj harfanmaulaa" or "ballebaaj harfanmaulaa" naam saamne aae
 For example, Keith Miller had a good batting average of 36
97 in Test cricket, and an excellent bowling average of 22
97, so he is called a bowler allrounder
 iske viparit, gairi sobers kaa 57

03 kaa gendbaaji kaa ausat tha, isliye unhen ballebaaj harfanmaulaa kaha ja saktaa he
 The real all-rounder is ideal for Imran Khan, who averaged 37 in batting and 23 in bowling, which is very good as a batsman and excellent as a bowler
 sobers "ab tak ke mahanatam harfanmaulaa" maane jate hai yadhyapi aankade bataate hai, ve bhi ek kshetra ke mukaable duusare main zyada achche the
 He is primarily described as a great batsman and a very good bowler
