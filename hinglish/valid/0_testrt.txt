 benign: Hepatocellular adenoma · Cavernous hemangioma saanchaa:endocrine gland neoplasia According to Dasharatha Valmiki Ramayana, Raghuvanshi was the king of Ayodhya
 vah ikshvaku kul ke the tathaa prabhu shriram, jo ki vishnu kaa avatar the, ke pita the
 The character of Dasharatha depicts the ideal Maharaja, the father who loves sons and a person fully devoted to his words
 unki teen patniyaan thim – kaushalya, sumitra tathaa kaikeyi
 Shanta Maharishi, the adopted daughter of King Romapada of Angadesh or Chitraratha, was the wife of Rishyasringa
 ek prasang ke anusaar shaanta dasharath kii putree thim tathaa romapad ko god di gayin thim
 Dasaratha reached middle age but there was no descendant of his son Rupi to support his dynasty
 unhone putr kaamana ke liye ashwamedh yajna tathaa putrakameshti yajna karaane kaa vichaar kiya
 One of his ministers Sumantra advised him to perform this yagya with his son-in-law Rishyashrunga or in common parlance to Shringi Rishi
 dasharath ke kul guru brahmarshi vashishtha the
 He was also their religious teacher and religious minister
 unke saare dharmik anushthanon kii adhyakshata karne kaa adhikaar keval dharm guru ko hi tha
 Therefore, after taking the order of Vashistha, Dashrath invited Shringi Rishi to preside over the yagna
 shrungi rishi ne donon yajna bhali bhaanti purna karawaaye tathaa putrakameshti yajna ke dauraan yajna vedi se ek alokik yajna purush yaa prajapathy purush utpann hua tathaa dasharath ko swarnapaatr main naivedhy kaa prasad pradaan karke yah kaha ki apni patniyon ko yah prasad khilaa kar vah putr prapti kar sakate hai
 Dasharatha was overjoyed by this and fed his Pattarani Kaushalya half of that prasad
 bache huye bhaag kaa aadha bhaag dasharath ne apni duusari rani sumitra ko diya
 He gave half of his remaining portion to Kaikeyi
 kuch sochakar unhone bachaa hua aathvaan bhaag bhi sumitra ko de diya
 Sumitra did not even eat the first part knowing that she would not eat her share until King Dasaratha gave Kaikeyi his share
 ab kaikeyi ne apana hissaa pehle kha liya or tatpashchaat sumitra ne apana hissaa khaaya
 For this reason Ram, Bharata and Lakshmana and Shatrughna were born
 ram ke sita ke vivaah ke baad dasharath ne yah ghoshnaa kar di ki ram kaa rajbhishek turant hoga
 Kaikeyi had a maid maithra who raised Kaikeyi from childhood and was raised with Kaikeyi as his dowry after his marriage
 vah ek kutil raajnneetijna thi
 He told Kaikeyi that the coronation of Rama would not harm Kaikeyi but only harm
 usne kaikeyi ko raja dasharath se apane do var maangane kii salaah di
 This incident is of the time when Dasaratha was fighting against the Asuras together with the Devas
 asuron ko khadedate samay unka rath yuddh ke keechad main fas gaya
 The charioteer of that chariot was Kaikeyi himself
 usee samay kisi shatru ne yudhastra chalaa kar dasharath ko ghayal kar diya tathaa vah maranasann ho gayi
 Dasaratha's death was certain if Kaikeyi did not take his chariot away from the battlefield and treat him
 dasharath ne hosh main aakar kaikeyi se koi bhi do var maangane kaa aagrah kiya
 At that time the circumstances of the kingdom of Ayodhya were favorable and all were living in a cordial environment, so Kaikeyi refused to ask for that bridesmaid and postponed saying that she would ask for this bridesmaid when the time comes
 ab jabaki dusht manthara ke bahekaave main aakar kaikeyi ko yah abhas ho gaya ki shriram ke rajbhishek ke baad uskaa anhith hi hone vaala he, usne kopbhavan main jane kaa vichaar kar liya
 In that period there was a Kopabhavan in Ranivas where any queen could express her disagreement by being angry due to any reason and it was the duty of the king to go to the court of Kopabhavan and persuade that queen
 raja dasharath ne bhi vaisaa hi kiya
 When Kaikeyi showed his desire to ask for his two brides, Kamoramukta King Dasharatha agreed
 yahan par yah nahin bhoolanaa chaiye ki kaikeyi dasharath kii sabase yuva rani thi or raja dasharath swayan chauthe kaal main pahunch gayi the
 Therefore, it was natural for him to awaken his lust towards Kaikeyi and King Dasaratha was always ready to fulfill whatever he had for that lust
 ab kaikeyi ne raja dasharath se vah do var maange
 From one of his sons Bharat to the throne of Ayodhya and the other to Rama for fourteen years of exile
 raja dasharath yah bardaashat na kar sake
 He tried to convince Kaikeyi a lot
 use bura-bhala bhi kaha
 But when Kaikeyi did not listen to him, he was hurt and fell there in the Kop Bhavan
 ram ko jab is vishay kii abhas hua to vah swayan hi dasharath ke sameep gayi or unase aagrah kiya ki raghukul kii maryaada ko dhyaan main rakhte hue vah kaikeyi ko donon var pradaan kar den
 They stubbornly convinced the king for these things and, wearing the clothes of ascetics, set out towards the forest with Sita and Lakshmana
 dasharath yah sadma bardaasht na kar sake or unhone apane praan tyaag diye
 The name of Dasharatha in the Ramayana comes only after that when Rama addresses himself as Dasharatha-son or introduces himself in this context

 ok rij neshnal leboratory kii ek taaja report ne nishkarsh nikaala he ki koyala urja se vaataavaran main, parmaanu urja sankriya kii tulana main vastav main adhik radiodharmita pahunchati he or ki koyale ke sanyantr ke vikiran ke baraabar jansankhya prabhavi khuraaq, parmaanu sanyantr ke adarsh sanchaalan se 100 guna zyada he
 Coal ash, of course, is much less radioactive than nuclear waste, but the ash goes directly into the atmosphere, while nuclear plants use irradiated reactor vessels, fuel rods and shielding to protect the environment from any radioactive waste on site 
 punarsansaadhan se, kharchit parmaanu eendhan se plutonium or uranium ke sambhavit rup se 95% ko, ise mishrit oxide eendhan main daal kar punah praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 This reduces long-term radioactivity within the remaining waste, as it is largely a short-term fission product and reduces its volume by more than 90%
 urja riektaron se naagarik eendhan kaa punarsansaadhan, vartmaan main bade paimaane par britain, france or rus main kiya jaataa he or sheeghra hi china main or shaayad bharat main bhi kiya jayega or japan main yah ek brihat paimaane par kiya ja rahaa he
 The full reprocessing capacity has not been achieved because it requires a 0} breeder reactor, which is not yet commercially available
 
 france ko sabase safal punarsansaadhan karne vaale ke rup main janaa jaataa he, lekin vah vartmaan main prayog kiye jane vaale vaarshik eendhan kaa keval 28% ko punarsansaadhit karata he, france ke andar 7% ko or shesh 21% ko rus main
 Unlike other countries, the US halted civil reprocessing as a part of the US non-proliferation policy from 1976 to 1981, as reprocessed materials such as plutonium could be used in nuclear weapons: however, reprocessing in the US is now permitted is
 phir bhi, america main sabhi kharchit parmaanu eendhan ko vartmaan main apshisht ke rup main samajha jaataa he
 In February 2006, a new US initiative, the Global Atomic Energy Partnership, was announced
 yah ek antarrashtriya prayaas hoga jo eendhan ke punarsansaadhan ko is tareeke se karegaa ki jisase parmaanu prasar avyavhaarya ho jayega, jabaki vikasshil deshon ko parmaanu urja uplabdh rahegi
 Uranium enrichment produces several tons of empty uranium, composed of U-238, from which the easily fissile U-235 isotope has been removed
 U-238 ek kathor dhaatu he jiske kai vanijyik upyog hai - udhaaharan ke liye, vimaan utpaadan, vikiran parirakshan or kavach - kyonki lead kii tulana main iskaa ghanatv ucch he
 Empty uranium is also useful in weapons such as the DU Penitrator's "self Sharpen", due to the tendency of uranium to fracture with shear bands
 kuch aisi bhi chintaaen hai ki U-238, un samoohon ke liye swasthya khatra utpann kar saktaa he jo is saamagree ke sampark main jarurat se zyada rahete hai, jaise tanks ke karmchaaree dal or ve naagarik jo aise kshetron main rahete hai jahaan DU gola barood kii ek badi maatra kaa prayog parirakshan, bam, missile, sphotak sheersh or goliyon main kiya gaya ho
 In January 2003 the World Health Organization released a report finding that contamination from DU munitions was up to a few tens of meters from the impact site in the local area and contamination of local vegetation and water was 'extremely low'
 report main yah bhi kaha gaya he ki kha lee gai lagbhag 70% DU choubees ghante baad sharir se nikal jaaegi or kuch dinon ke baad 90%
 The economics of nuclear power plants are mainly influenced by the huge initial investment required to build a plant
 2009 main, america main ek nae sanyantr kii laagat anumaanit rup se $6 se $10 bilian ke bich hoti he
 Therefore it is generally more economical to run them as long as possible or to build additional reactor blocks in existing facilities
 In 2008, the costs of building a new nuclear power plant were rising faster than the costs of other types of power plants
 
 2003 MIT ke liye is udyog kaa adhyayan karne ke liye gathit ek pratishthit panel ne nimnlikhit paaya: The MIT study used a 40-year baseline for the life of a nuclear reactor
 kai maujuuda sanyantron ko acchhee tarah se sanchalit karne ke liye is avadhi se aage badhaayaa gaya he or adhyayanon se pataa chalaa he ki sanyantr ke jivan ko 60 varshon tak badhaane se uski samgr laagat naatakeey rup se kam ho jaati he
 Comparative economics with other energy sources is discussed in the main article above and in the nuclear power debate
 aksar yah daawa kiya gaya he ki parmaanu centre apane utpaadan main lacheele nahin hote hai, jiskaa arth he ki charam maang ko puraa karne ke liye urja ke anya roopon kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 While this is true in the case of some reactors, it no longer applies to at least some modern design ones
 parmaanu sanyantron ko france main bade paimaane par niyamit taur par lod paalan mod main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Boiling water reactors normally have load-bearing capacity, which is implemented by varying the water flow
 carbon dioxide utsarjan ke jivan chakra vishleshan kii adhikansh tulana, parmaanu urja ko navikarniya urja sroton kii tulana main darshaati he
 The nuclear power debate is about the controversy that surrounds the deployment and use of nuclear fission reactors for civilian purposes to generate electricity from nuclear fuel
 parmaanu urja se sambandhit vivaad 1970 or 1980 ke dashak ke dauraan charam par tha, jab yah kuch deshon main, "itnaa bheeshan ho gaya jo praudyogiki itihaas main abhootpurv tha"
 Proponents of nuclear power argue that nuclear power is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions and enhances energy security while reducing dependence on foreign oil
 samarthakon kaa daawa he ki parmaanu urja, jeevashm eendhan ke pramukh vyavhaarya vikalp ke vipareet, vastav main koi paaramparik vaayu pradooshan nahin failaati he, jaise green house gas or kala dhuna
 samarthakon kaa yah bhi maananaa he ki parmaanu urja hi adhikansh pashchimi deshon ke liye urja main nirbharta praapt karne kaa ekmaatr vyavhaarya rasta he
 Proponents claim that the risk of waste storage is small and can be further reduced by the use of the latest technology in new reactors and, compared to other types of major power plants in the Western world, operational safety history has been excellent
 virodhiyon kaa maananaa he ki parmaanu urja logon or paryaavaran ke liye khatra utpann karti he
 
 These threats include the processing, transport and storage problems of radioactive nuclear waste, nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism, as well as the health hazards and environmental harm from uranium mining
 He also argues that reactors themselves are highly complex machines where many things can go wrong or do and many serious nuclear accidents have occurred
 aalochak is baat par vishwaas nahin karte hai ki urja ke strot ke rup main parmaanu vikhandan ke upyog ke jokhim ko nai praudyogiki ke vikaas ke madhyam samyojit kiya ja saktaa he
 He also argues that when all energy-intensive phases of the nuclear fuel chain are taken care of, from uranium mining to nuclear discharge, nuclear power is not a low-carbon power source

 Politics gateway 1956 kaa samvidhan pakistan main march 1956 se oktober 1958 tak lagu pakistan kii sarvocch vidhi samhita va samvidhan thi, jise 1958 ke takhtapalat ko baad nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 This was the first constitution of Pakistan
 1950 main bharat main samvidhan ke parvartan ke baad, pakistan ke saansadon ne apane samvidhan ko gathit karne ke prayaas tej kar die
 Prime Minister Mohammad Ali and his government officials worked with the support of opposition parties in the country to prepare a constitution for Pakistan
 ant main, is sanyukt kaary ke kaaran, samvidhan ke pehle samoocchy ko lagu kiya gaya
 The incident took place on 23 March 1956, to this day still celebrates Republic Day on the occasion of the enforcement of the Constitution of Pakistan
 is samvidhan ne pakistan ko "ekasadaneey vidhayika" ke saath sarkaar kii sansadeey pranali pradaan kii
 Also, it officially declared Pakistan an Islamic republic
 iske alaava, isamen, samta ke siddhant ko bhi pehali baar pesh kiya gaya tha
 Its main features were: samvidhan dwaara, iskundar mirza ne adhyaksh pad grahan kiya, lekin rashtriya maamalon main unki lagaataar asanvaidhanik bhagidaari ke kaaran, chaar nirvaachit pradhanmantriyon ko maatr do saalon main hi barkhaast kar diya gaya
 Under public pressure, President Iskandar Mirza upheld the coup in 1958; And thus this constitution was almost suspended
 sheeghra hi baad main general ayub khan ne iskundar mirza apdasth or khud ko raashtrapati ghoshit kar diya
 And so this constitution was able to run only for 3 years

 bhugol vah shaastra he jiske dwaara prithvi ke upree swarup or uske prakritik vibhaagon kaa gyaan hota he
 Establishing a work-causal relationship between the findings of natural sciences, the study of the earth's variations from a human point of view is the essence of geography
 prithvi kii sataha par jo sthaan vishesh hai unki samtaon tathaa vishmataaon kaa kaaran or unka spashtikaran bhugol kaa nijee kshetra he
 The word geography is made up of two words ie earth and round
 bhugol ek ore anya shrunkhalabaddh vigyaanon se praapt gyaan kaa upyog us seemaa tak karata he jahaan tak vah ghatnaon or vishleshanon kii samiksha tathaa unke sambandhon ke yathasambhav samuchit samanvay karne main sahaayak hota he
 On the other hand, knowledge derived from other sciences, which geography uses, has many etymological assumptions and prescribed classifications
 yadi ye dharanaayen or vargeekaran bhugolic uddeshyon ke liye upyogi na hon, to bhugol ko nijee vyutpattik dharanaayen tathaa vargeekaran kii pranali viksit kerani hoti he
 Therefore, geography helps in the growth of human knowledge in three ways: sarvapratham pracheen unani vidwaan iratosthaniz ne bhugol ko dharaatal ke ek vishishtvigyaan ke rup main manyata di
 Subsequently, Herodotus and the Roman scholars Strabo and Claudius Ptolemy gave geography a definitive form of history
 is prakaar bhugol main 'kahan' 'kaise 'kab' 'kyon' va 'kitne' prashnon kii uchit vayakhya kii jaati hai
 Geography is the oldest science and its foundations are reflected in the works of early Greek scholars
 bhugol shabd kaa pratham prayog unani vidwaan iretosthanij ne teesri shatabdi isa purv main kiya tha
 Geography studies the interactions of all physical and human facts on a wide scale and the topographies resulting from these interactions
 yah bataata he ki kaise, kyon or kahan maanviya va prakritik kriyakalapon kaa udbhav hota he or kaise ye kriyalap ek duusare se antarsambandhit hai
 The study method of geography has been changing
 praarambhik vidwaan varnanaatmak bhugolvetta the
 Later, geography evolved into analytical geography
 aaj yah vishay na keval varnan karata he, balki vishleshan ke saath-saath bhavishyavaanee bhi karata he
 According to early evidences, the scholars of this time understood the physical facts of the Earth through map-making and astronomical measurements
 bhugol main aarambhik vidwaan dene kaa shrey yunaan ko hi jaataa he, jisamen pramukh the homer, herrodotus, thels, arastu or iretosthanij
 This period began from the middle of the 15th century to the end of the 18th century
 yah kaal aarambhik bhugolvettaon kii khojon or anveshanon dwaara vishwa kii bhautik va saanskrithik prakruti ke bare main vrahat gyaan pradaan karata he
 The early 17th century witnessed the beginning of new 'scientific geography'
 columbus, vascodigama, magalen or thomas cook is kaal ke pramukh anveshankartta the
 Varenius, Kant, Humboldt and Ritter were prominent geographers of this period
 in vidwaanon ne maanchitrkala ke vikaas main yogadan diya or naveen sthalon kii khoj kii, jiske falswaroop bhugol ek vaigyanik vishay ke rup main viksit hua
 Ritter and Humboldt are often cited as the founders of modern geography
 saamanytah 19veen sadi ke uttarardh kaa kaal aadhunik bhugol kaa kaal mana jaataa he
 In fact, Reitzel was the first modern geographer, who built the structure of modern geography on the foundations established by long-standing geographers
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad bhugol kaa vikaas badi teevr gati se hua
 American and European geographers such as Hartshorne contributed the maximum during this period
 hartshorn ne bhugol ko ek aise vigyaan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jo kshetreey vibhinnataaon kaa adhyayan karata he
 Current geographers view regional approaches and systematic approaches as complementary approaches rather than contradictory approaches
 bhugol ne aaj vigyaan kaa darja praapt kar liya he, jo prithvi tal par upasthit vividh prakritik or saanskrithik roopon kii vyakhya karata he
 Geography is a holistic and interrelated field study that studies the change in spatial structure from past to future
 is tarah bhugol kaa kshetra vividh vishyon jaise sainya sevaaon, paryaavaran prabandhan, jal sansaadhan, aapadaa prabandhan, mausam vigyaan, niyojan or vividh saamaajik vigyaanon main he
 Apart from this, the geographer can be helpful in daily life related events like tourism, relocation, accommodation and health activities
 vidwaanon ne bhugol ke teen mukhya vibhaag kiye hai- ganitiya bhugol, bhautik bhugol tathaa maanav bhugol
 In the first division, the relation of Earth with other planets and satellites etc
 of the solar world is described and its relative relationship with them is described
 is vibhaag kaa bahut kuch sambandh ganit jyotish se bhi he
 In the second division, the physical form of the earth is described and it is known from whom the river, mountain, country, city, etc
 are called and where are so many countries, cities, rivers or mountains etc
 saadharantah bhugol se uske isi vibhaag kaa arth liya jaataa he
 The third department of geography is human geography, under which political geography also comes, in which it is discussed which departments of the earth are in view of politics, governance, language, caste and civilization etc
 and what is the extent and extent of those departments etc
 
 ek anya drushti se bhugol ke do pradhan ang he : shrunkhalabaddh bhugol tathaa pradeshik bhugol
 Regional geography is the byproduct of centering the coordinate of the branches of chain geography at a particular location on the Earth
 bhugol ek pragatisheel vigyaan he
 Experts in each country are developing their own fields
 falat: isaki nimnlikhit anek shakhaayen tathaa upashakhaayen ho gai he : Economic Geography - Its branches are agriculture, industry, minerals, power and reserves geography and land consumption, commercial, transport and traffic geography

 There are 5 oceans on Earth: Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean | South Ocean Topography - shail - aagney shail kayantarit shail avsaadee shail | Atmosphere, season, temperature, heat, heat, decay heat, humidity
 maanav bhugol, bhugol kii vah shakha he jo maanav samaaj ke kriyakalapon or unke parinaam swaroop bane bhugolic pratirupon kaa adhyayan karata he
 Under this comes political, cultural, social and economic aspects of human beings
 maanav bhugol ko anek shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he, jaise:' Geography has been defined in various forms in different periods of history
 pracheen unani vidwaanon ne bhugolic dharanaon ko do pakshon main rakhaa tha- The emergence of territorial approach in geography also emphasizes the descriptive nature of geography
 hambolt ke anusaar, bhugol prakruti se sambandhit vigyaan he or yah prithvi par paye jane vaale sabhi sadhano kaa adhyayan va varnan karata he
 There are three main branches of geography based on Hetner and Hartshorne: physical geography, human geography and regional geography
 bhautik bhugol main prakritik parighatnaon kaa ullekh hota he, jaise ki jalwaayu vigyaan, mrudaa or vanaspati
 Human geography describes the relationship between surface and human society
 bhugol ek intaraa-anushaasanic vishay he
 Geography has close links with mathematics, natural sciences and social sciences
 jabaki anya vigyaan vishisht prakaar kii parighatnaon kaa hi varnan karte hai, bhugol vividh prakaar kii un parighatnaon kaa bhi adhyayan karata he, jinka adhyayan anyavigyaanon main bhi shaamil hota he
 Thus geography has established itself as a synthesized study of interrelated behaviors
 bhugol sthanon kaa vigyaan he
 Geography is both natural and social science, which studies both human and environment
 yah bhautik va saanskrithik vishwa ko jodta he
 Physical geography studies the natural environment arising from the Earth's system
 maanav bhugol raajnneetik, aarthik, saamaajik, saanskrithik or janankikeey prakriyaaon se sambandhit he
 It is also related to varied use of resources
 praarambhik bhugol sirf sthanon kaa varnan karata tha
 Although it is still included in the study of geography, there has been a change in the description of its patterns in the last few years
 bhugolic parighatnaon kaa varnan saamanytah do upagamon ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he jaise pradeshik or krambaddh
 Explains the creation and characteristics of territorial approach areas
 yah is baat kaa varnan karne kaa prayaas karata he ki koi kshetra kaise or kyon ek duusare se alag he
 The state can be physical, social, economic, political, demographic etc
 krambaddh upaagam parighatnaon tathaa saamaanya bhugolic mahatvon ke dwaara sanchalit he
 Each phenomenon is studied on the basis of geography, regional variations and their relationship with each other
 bhugol kii praayah sabhi shakhaon vishesh rup se bhautik bhugol kii shakhaon main tathyon ke vishleshan main ganitiya vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Scientific study of celestial bodies is done in astronomy
 bhootal kii ghatnaon or tatwon par akashiya pindon - surya, chandramaa, dhoomaketuon aadi kaa pratyaksh prabhaav hota he
 That is why geography studies the solar system, the movement of the sun on its virtual path, the daily and annual movements of the earth and the changes that occur as a result - day and night and season changes, lunar arts, solar eclipse, lunar eclipse, etc
 in tatwon or ghatnaon kaa moulik adhyayan khagol vigyaan main kiya jaataa he
 Thus geography has a closer relationship with astronomy
 bhu-vigyaan prithvi ke sanghathan, sanrachana tathaa itihaas ke vaigyanik adhyayan san sambandhit he
 This includes the study of the constituents of the earth, the forces acting on the surface and the structures produced from them, the structure and distribution of the crustacean rocks, geological periods of the earth, etc
 bhugol main sthalroopon ke vishleshan main bhuvigyaan ke siddhanton tathaa saakshyon kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 In this way, physical geography, especially geomorphology, has a very close relationship with geology
 bhootal ko prabhavit karne vaale bhugolic karkon main jalwaayu sarvaadhik prabhaavshaalee or mahatvapurn kaarak he
 Meteorology studies the atmosphere, especially the physical processes occurring in it and the various processes related to the associated lithosphere and hydrosphere
 iske antargat vayudab, taapmaana, pawan, ardrata, varshan, meghachhadan, surya prakaash aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 These elements of meteorology are also analyzed in geography

 Thus we find that there is a very close and close relationship between geography and hydrology
 mrudaa vigyaan mitti ke nirmaan, sanrachana or visheshta kaa vaigyanik adhyayan karata he
 The distribution of soils on the ground floor is studied under soil geography
 mitti kaa adhyayan krishi bhugol kaa bhi mahatvapurn vishay he
 Thus, the closeness of geography is also found from soil science
 ped-paudhon kaa maanav jivan se gaharaa sambandh he
 Botany is the scientific study of plant life and its entire world forms
 prakritik vanaspatiyon ke sthanik vitaran or visheshtaon kaa vishleshan bhautik bhugol kii shakha jaev bhugol or upashakha vanaspati yaa padap bhugol main kii jaati he
 Animal science or zoology is the scientific study of the structure, classification and functions of all types of animal life
 manushya ke liye jantu jagat or pashu sansaadhan kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 Animals are very useful to humans
 manushya ko pashuon se anek upyogi padaarth yatha doodh, maance, oon, chamada aadi praapt hote hai or kuch pashuon kaa prayog saamaan dhone or parivahan yaa sawari karne ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Biogeography is a sub-branch of animal geography in which the spatial distribution and characteristics of various animals are analyzed
 maanav jivan ke aarthik, saamaajik, saanskrithik sabhi kshetron main pashu jagat kaa mahatvapurn sthaan hone ke kaaran isko bhugolic adhyayanon main bhi vishisht sthaan praapt he
 Therefore, geography has a close relationship with animal science
 bhojan, vastra or aashray manushya kii praathmik aavashyaktaaen hai jo kisi bhi desh, kaal yaa paristhiti main prayek vyakti ke liye anivaary hoti hai

 Human geography studies the history of human civilization and the development of human society in geographical perspective
 kisi bhi desh yaa pradesh ke itihaas par vahaan ke bhugolic paryaavaran tathaa paristhitiyon kaa gaharaa prabhaav paaya jaataa he
 When we analyze natural and human or cultural facts from a developmental point of view, then there is an explanation of the changing relationship between man and earth
 kisi pradesh main jansankhya, krishi, pashupaalan, khanan, udyog dhandhon, parivahan ke sadhano, vyapaarik evam vanijki sansthaaon aadi ke aitihaasik vikaas kaa adhyayan maanav bhugol main kiya jaataa he jiske liye upyukt sakshya or pramaan itihaas se hi praapt hote hai
 The 'governance system' is the focal point of the study of political science
 isamen vibhinan rashtron evam rajyon kii shashan pranaaliyon, sarkaron, antarrashtriya sambandhon aadi kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Political geography is a branch of human geography that includes the study of the extent, extent of politically organized areas, their various components, subdivisions, governed territories, resources, internal and foreign political relations, etc
 maanav bhugol kii ek anya shakha bhuraajnneeti bhi he jiske antargat bhootal ke vibhinn pradeshon kii raajnneetik pranali vishesh rup se antarrashtiy raajnneeti par bhugolic karkon ke prabhaav kii vyakhya kii jaati he
 It is clear from these facts that geography and political science are closely related
 janankiki yaa janasankhyikee ke antargat jansankhya ke aakaar, sanrachana, vikaas aadi kaa parimanatmak adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 In this, along with the collection, classification, evaluation, analysis and projection of population data, demographic models and procedures are also explained
 maanav bhugol or uski upashakha jansankhya bhugol main bhugolic paryaavaran ke sambandh main janankikeey prakramon tathaa pratirupon main paayi jane vaali kshetreey bhinnataaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Thus due to the subject analogy, there is a close relationship between geography and demography
