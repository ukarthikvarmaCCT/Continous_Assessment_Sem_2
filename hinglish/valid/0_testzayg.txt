 In physics, angular momentum, moment moment or rotational momentum is the measurement of the value of an object's rotation, taking into account its mass, shape, and velocity
 yah ek sadish raashi he jo kisi vishesh aksh ke saapeksh jadtwaghurna va koniya veg ke guna ke baraabar hota he
 The angular momentum of a body of particles is equal to the sum of the angular momentum of all particles present in that body
 kisi bindu ke saapeksh kisi 'kan' kaa koniya samveg ko sadish gunanfal ke rup main is prakaar abhivyakt kiya ja saktaa he- Where r { \ displaystyle \ mathbf {r}} is the position vector of that particle relative to that point
 kisi aksh ke saapeksh kisi kan kaa koniya samveg us aksh se kan tak ke lambavat sadish or us kan ke raikhik samveg ke sadish gunanfal ke baraabar hota he
 Note that the value of the angular momentum depends on the choice of the axis, while the value of the linear momentum has nothing to do with the choice of the axis
 kisi bindu ke saapeksh kisi pind kaa koniya samveg us bindu ke saapeksh us pind ke sabhi kanon ke koniya samveg ke sadish yoga ke baraabar hota he

 are recorded in the scripture, also consider those Bhagats as Sikh Satgurus and try to follow their teachings
 sikh ek hi ishwar ko maanate hai, jise ve ek-onkaar kehete hai

 Not surprisingly, from a liberal perspective, Guru Nanak Dev embraced the goodness of all religions
 unka mukhya upadesh tha ki ishwar ek he, usee ne sabko banaaya he
 Hindu Muslims are all children of the same God and all are equal for God
 unhone yah bhi bataaya he ki ishwar satya he or manushya ko achche kaary karne chahie taaki paramatma ke darbar main use lajjit na hona pade
 Guru Nanak has said in one of his books that Pandits read pothi, but do not understand the idea

 His words are false, he wanders into the world

 He also honored the compositions of 15 saints and 14 creators along with five Sikh Gurus in the Adi Granth

 Guruji showed his benevolent humanist vision by storing the speech of 15 saints in Shaikh Farid, Jayadeva, Trilochan, Sadhana, Namdev, Veni, Ramananda, Kabir, Ravidas, Pipa, Saitha, Dhanna, Bhikhan, Parmanand and Surdas

 It is noteworthy that when Guru Arjunadeva completed the editing work of Adigranth in 1604 AD, then the first five gurus had the works in it
 iske baad guru govind singh ne apane pita guru teg bahadur kii vaani shaamil karke aadigranth ko antim rup diya
 There are a total of 778 posts of 15 saints in the adi-granth
 inamen 541 kabir ke, 122 shaikh farid ke, 60 namdev ke or 40 sant ravidaas ke hai
 One to four positions of other saints have been placed in the Adi Granth
 gauratlab he ki aadi granth main sangrahit ye rachanaayen gat 400 varshon se adhik samay ke bina kisi parivartan ke puri tarah surakshit hai
 But the former Guru Gobind Singh, before his death, appointed Guru Granth Saheb for the spiritual guidance of all Sikhs and the entire Khalsa Panth for 'worldly direction' as 'guru Pad'
 us samay aadigranth guru sahab ke rup main sweekaar kiya jane laga
 Guru Gobind Singh initiated people of all religions and castes into the guru-shishya-tradition to make Sikhism a classic
 unhone aane vaali shatabdiyon ke liye is nae manushya kaa srijan kiya
 This new human being is not always divided into castes and religions, is always committed to the protection of religion, human and country
 sabko saath lekar chalane kii yah sancharana, nihsandeh, sikh maanas kii thati he
 Then, the ultimate goal of Sikhism is human welfare
 kadaachit isi maanav-kalyaan kaa sabak sikhaane ke liye guru govind singh ne aurangzeb ko ek lambaa patr likhaa tha, jisamen ishwar kii stuti ke saath-saath aurangzeb ke shashan-kaal main ho rahe anyaay tathaa atyaachaar kaa maarmik ullekh he
 In this letter, the pretext of doing righteous deeds and not shedding the blood of innocent subjects, cracking under the guise of religion and God and warning for lies and like a warrior, is a war to fight in the battlefield
 kaha jaataa he ki is patr ko padhakar aurangzeb kii runh kaanp uthi thi or iske baad vah adhik samay tak jivit nahin rahaa
 Even his inner desire to meet Guruji could not be fulfilled
 yah koi shrey lene-dene vaali baat nahin he ki sikh guruon kaa sahaj, saral, sada or swaabhaavik jivan jin mulyon par aadhaarit tha, nishchay hi un mulyon ko unhone paramparaagat bhartiya chetana se grahan kiya tha
 According to the demand of the country, time and circumstances, he had deeply influenced the political, social, religious, economic and cultural life of the then by changing his personality
 sikh guruon ne apane samay ke dharm or samaaj-vyavastha ko prabhavit kiya tha
 The Sikh Gurus gave a new direction to the religion and social order of their time
 unhone bhakthi, gyaan, upasna, aadhyatm evam darshan ko ek sankeern daayre se nikaalkar samaaj ko us tabake ke bich pahunchaa diya, jo isse purnat: vanchit the
 This awakened the self-realization of the people and a new vision and awareness arose in them, they started recognizing the self-realized experience
 is prakaar nirgun niraakaar param shakti kaa pravaah prakhar evam twarit rup se praapt hua
 Another peculiarity of Sikhism is that Sikh Gurus talked about human beings venturing into life, achieving happiness while earning and attaining God by meditating
 unka maananaa tha ki parishram karanevaala vyakti sabhi chintaaon se mukt rahata he
 Guru Nanak has even said that the person who earns hard work and does some charity in it, he recognizes the right path
 sikh guruon dwaara prarambh kii gai ‘lungar’ pratha vishvabandhutv, maanav-prem, samanta evam udaartaa kii anyatra na pai jane vaali misaal he
 Sikh Gurus also established cultural and moral values that never fade
 unhone apane darshanik evam aadhyatmik chintan se bhaanp liya tha ki aane vaala samay kaisaa hoga
 Therefore, he insisted on alternative thinking against blind copying
 shaareerik-abhyaas evam vinodashiltaa ko jivan kaa aavashyak ang mana
 Punjabi folk songs, folk dances and Hola Mahalla are the inspiration-seeds of the Sikh Gurus at the core of their performance
 in lokgeeton evam lok nrityon kii jaden punjab kii dharti se footati hai or logon main thirakan paidaa karti hai
 Bhangra and Giddha are the cultural pride of Punjab, whose beats are often heard in India and abroad
 punjabi samskruti rashtriyata kaa merudand he
 There is unity in its soul, sympathy, cooperation, compassion and human love in its blood
 punjabi samskruti aadmi se jodatii he or uski pahchaan banaati he
 a Punjabi wandering in any corner of the world is one of its own miniature Punjab
 prayek sikh kii apni swatantra chetana he, jo jivan-sambandhi samasyaon ko apane hi prakaash main sulajhane ke uddeshy se gambheer rup se vichaar karti ai he
 Take the history of the Sikh Gurus, they did not formulate the imperialist concept at all, instead they kept on looking at the humanitarian world through cultural, religious and spiritual harmony
 azaadi ke purv, bharat-paak vibhaajan evam iske baad kai dashakon main punjab main samay-samay par aae hinsaatmak-zalazalon evam nirdayee vidhwanson ke baavjood is dharti ke logon ne apana shantipurna astitv banaae rakhaa he
 The guidance has been flashes
 sikhon ke das guru he
 Shri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is a religious book of Sikhs
 sikhamat kii shuruyaat hi "ek" se hoti he
 The Sikh scriptures only interpret "one"
 ek ko nirankaar, parbrahm adik gunavachak naamon se janaa jaataa hai
 The form of Nirankar is mentioned at the beginning of Sri Gurugranth Sahib, which is called 'mool Mantra' in common language
 takreeban sabhi dharm isi "ek" kii aradhana karte hai, lekin "ek" kii vibhinn avasthaaon kaa zikr va vyakhya shri guru granth sahib ji main di gai he wo apane aap main niraali he
 The living soul which is formless, has only 4 qualities of Nirankar
 baaki chaar gun praapt karte hi jeev aatma vaapis nirankaar main samaa jaati he, lekin usko praapt karne ke liye jeev aatma ko khud ko gurmat ke gyaan dwaara samajhnaa zaruri he
 It is called "soul contemplation" in Sikhism
 aatma kaa niraakaari swaroop man, chit, surat, budhi, mati adik kii jaankaree sikh dharm ke mul sikhyaon main di jaati he
 By understanding these activities, a person can understand himself
 sikh dharm kii shuruyaat hi aatam gyaan se hoti he
 What is soul? Where did it come from? Why does it exist? What to do is Etihadi is taught by special Sikh propaganda of spirituality
 aatma ke vikaar kya hai, kaise vikaar mukt ho
 The soul itself is part of the nirankar
 iskaa gyaan karavaate karavaate nirankaar kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Sikhism does not believe in personnel philosophy
 anya dharmo kaa kahana he ki prabhu ko ache karm pasand hai or bure karmo waalon ke saath parameshwar bahut bura karata he
 But according to Sikhism, humans cannot do anything themselves
 insaan sirf sochane tak simit he karata vahi he jo "hukum" main he, chaahe wo kisi garib ko daan de rahaa ho chaahe wo kisi ko jaan se maar rahaa ho
 The same thing was made firm by Shri Gurugranth Sahib at the beginning: isi liye gurmat main paap punya ko nahin man jaataa
 If a person performs an action, then that difference should be done by mixing voice with soul
 yahi karn he kii gurmat karm cond ke viruddh he
 Shri Guru Nanak Dev ji tried to liberate the common people from the clutches of the contractors, pandas, pirs etc
 of religion by removing the prevalent practices, superstitions, shabby stereotypes and hypocrisy in the Indian society of his time
 nimnlikhit chaar 'padaarth' maanav ko apane jeevankaal main praapt karnaa anivaary he : Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha were not taken into four substances
 shri guru gobind singh ji kehete hai: In Sikhism, devotees and Satgurus have called Nirankar without formlessness
 kyonki sansaarik padaarth to ek din khatm ho jate hai lekin parabrahm kabhi nahin marataa
 That is why it has been called a famine
 yahi nahin jeev aatma bhi aakar rahit he or is sharir ke saath kuch samay ke liye bandhi he
 Its existence is without the body, which is far from the intelligence of the common man
 yahi karn he kii sikhamat murti puja ke sakht khilaaf he
 Satgurus and devotees have treated idol worshipers with blind, animal etiquette words
 us kii tasviir bane nahin ja sakati
 Not only this, any worldly material like Kabar, historical things of devotees and Satgurus, idols are worshiped against the basic principles of Sikhs
 dharmik granth kaa gyaan ek vidhi jo nirankaar ke desh kii taraf lekar jaati he, jiske samaksh sikh natmastak hote hai, lekin dharmik granthon kii puja bhi sikhon ke bunayadi usulon ke khilaaf he
 In Sikhism, every living being is called an avatar
 har jeev us nirankaar kii ansh he
 Any panchi, animal, tree, etc
 are incarnations in the world
 maanush kii yoni main jeev apana gyaan puraa karne ke liye avatarit hua he
 The person is not worshiped in Sikhism as "god forbid that everyone is alive, giving, AK God"
 tamaam avatar ek nirankaar kii shart par puure nahin utarate koi bhi ajooni nahin he
 This is the reason that Sikhs do not consider anyone as God
 haan agar koi avatar gurmat kaa upades karata he to sikh us upadesh ke saath zarur jude rahete hai
 As Krishna has said in the Gita that soul does not die and death does not happen, Sikhism agrees with this, but further Krishna has said that karma is the religion from which Sikhism does not agree
 pigambar wo he jo nirankaar kaa sandesh athwa gyaan aam lokai main baante
 As it is said in Islam that Muhammad is the last prophet, it is said among the Sikhs that "every jug jug bhakta upaaya"
 bhakt same dar same paidaa hote hai or nirankaar kaa sandesh logon tak pahunchaate hai
 Sikhism agrees with "la ilaha ill Allah" but only Muhammad is not Rasul Allah
 arjuna dev ji kehete hai "dhur kii bani ai, tin sagali chint mitaai", arthath mujhe dhur se vaani ai he or meri sagal chintaaen mit gai hai kionki jisaki taak main main baitha tha mujhe wo mil gaya he
 Originally, the statement of devotees Avam Satguru was done by Satguru Arjun Dev Ji, which is called Adi Granth, is famous as a religious text of Sikhs
 This book is a true sermon of 36 devotees and it is astonishing that 36 devotees have lectured Nirankar in equal view
 There is no difference in a word
 Along with the Sikh Adi Granth, the Dasam Granth, which is the collection of the speech of Satguru Gobind Singh Ji, is also considered
 This book is under the Khalsa
 But taking knowledge of Adi Granth in the original form is the best practice for Sikhs
 yahi nahin sikh har us granth ko sammaan dete hai, jisame gurmat kaa upadesh he | Adi Granth or Adi Guru Granth or Guru Granth Sahib or Adi Guru Darbar or Pothi Sahib, is a religious book compiled by Guru Arjun Dev, which records the experiences of the spiritual life of 36 devotees
 The Adi Granth is said to be because of the knowledge of "adi" in it
 According to the chanting, "truth" is the beginning
 The scripture that makes it known is called Adi Granth
 Its references are within the text itself
 However, Vidwan says that because this book was not made by Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, this is why it is an Adi Granth and Satguru Gobind Singh Ji climbed the 9th palace, hence this Adi Granth was called Jagan Guru Granth
 bhakton evam satguruon kii vaani potheon ke rup main satguru arjuna dev ji ke samay mojood thim | bhai gurdas ji ne yah granth likhaa or satguru arjuna dev ji disha nirdharak bane | unhon ne apni vaani bhi granth main darj kii | yah granth kii kai nakle bhi taiyaar hui | 1430 pages of Adi Granth were standardized by the Khalsa
 dasam granth, sikhon kaa dharmagranth he jo satgur gobind singh ji kii pavitra vaani evam rachnaao kaa sangrah he
 Guru Gobind Singh ji made many compositions during his lifetime, whose small books were made
 un kii maut ke baad un kii dharm patni mata sundari kii ajna se bhai mani singh khalsa or anya khalsa bhaaiyon ne guru gobind singh ji kii sari rachnaao ko iktha kiya or ek jild main chadha diya jise aaj "dasam granth" kaha jaataa he
 Simply put, Guru Gobind Singh ji composed and Khalsa edited
 dasam granth kaa satkar sari sikh kaum karti he
 The Vāsānī of the Dāsam Granth such as Jaap Sahib, Tāva Parsād Savaiye and Chopai Sahib are part of the daily Sajda, Nitnem, of the Sikhs, and these Vanyas are read while making Khande Bate's Pahol, which is called Amrit Chakna in the common language
 takhat hajur sahib, takhat patna sahib or nihang singh ke gurudwaron main dasam granth kaa guru granth sahib ke saath parkash hota hai or rose hukamname bhi liya jaataa he
 The attacks of Sarabloh Granth and Bhai Gurdas are doubtless creations
 However, the Khalsa Mahima is adorned in the Sarbloh Granth which is the authenticated work of Satguru Gobind Singh, the rest of the Srabloh text contains a karma scandal, a person worshiping itiyadi vizhi mojud who is against the basic principles of the Sikhs
 The words of Bhai Gurdas are recorded in the words of idol worship, karma doctrine etc

 basal ke avakal sameekaran ke vihit halon ko basal falan kehete hai
 The general form of Basel's differential equation is given below- isamen α koi vaastavik yaa samishra sankhya he
 The most common and important cases occur for integer or half integer values of α
 in falnon kii paribhaasha sarvapratham barnauli ne kii thi or baad main basal ne inkaa samanyikaran kiya
 Basal functions are also called cylindrical functions or 'cylindrical functions' because they are obtained by solving the Laplace equation by converting it to a cylindrical coordinate system
 laplas sameekaran or helmholts sameekaran kaa belani nirdeshaank pranali main yaa goleey nirdeshaank pranali main jab vilganeey hal paane kii koshish kii jaati he to basal falan saamne aata he
 For this reason, the basal functions are particularly important for the problems of wave speed and static potential
 jab belani nirdeshaank pranali main samasyaon ke hal nikaalane kii koshish kii jaati he to purnank order vaale basal falan praapt hote hai; or jab goleey nirdeshaank main kal nikaalte hai to ardh-purnank order vaale basal falan milte hai
 for example- uparokt ke alaava basal falnon ke anya gun bhi hai jinka anya prakaar kii samasyaon main upyog kiya ja saktaa he; jaise sanket prasanskaran main

 This is an infinite series - nimnlikhit falan ko dwitiya prakaar kaa basal falan yaa newman falan kehete hai
 The following function is a generalized form of the first type of basal functions, which is defined for all values of integers and integers of & alpha
 jahaan γ ko gamma falan kehete hai jo phactorial falan kaa samanyikrut rup he
 Another definition of the basal function for integer values of n { \ displaystyle n} is also possible
 yah paribhaasha samakal kaa upyog karke di jaati he- Another integral representation is the following
 isi tareeke kaa prayog basal ne multah kiya tha or isi paribhaasha se hi unhone is falan ke anek gun nikaale the
 You can extend this definition to non-integers as follows> 0 {for \ displaystyle \ Re> 0}): yaa, α > − 1 2 { \ displaystyle \ alpha >-{ \ frac {1}{2}}} ke liye, basal falan ko nimnlikhit falan dwaara bhi nirupit kar sakate hai- Knowledge of the origin of basal functions is useful in many situations

 unke dwaara paris se prakashit "vandemaataram" patr pravasi bharatiyon main kaaphi lokapriy hua
 At the International Socialist Congress held in Stuttgart, Germany in 1907, Madame Bhikaji Cama said that - "continuation of British rule in India is a stigma in the name of humanity
" ek mahaan desh bharat ke hiton ko isse baari kshati pahunch rahi he
 "he appealed to the people to cooperate in liberating India from slavery and called upon the Indians that -" Go ahead, we are Hindustani and Hindustan belongs to Hindustan

 Mrs
 Cama's great contribution was to raise the world public opinion against imperialism and to present India's desire for freedom from foreign rule
 bharat kii swadhinata ke liye ladate hue unhone lambii avadhi tak nirvasit jivan bitaayaa tha
 According to the facts, although Bhikaji believed in non-violence, he also called for opposition to unjust violence

 His colleagues considered him the 'mother of the Indian revolution'; Whereas the British called her a notorious woman, dangerous revolutionary, anarchist revolutionary, anti-british and inconsistent
 europe ke samaajawaadee samudaay main shrimati kama kaa paryaapt prabhaav tha
 This was evident when he invited European journalists to defend their patriots

 saanchaa:mudrika maarg Morarji Desai was the freedom fighter of India and the fourth Prime Minister of the country
 vah pratham pradhanmantri the jo bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bajaay anya dal se the
 He is the only person to have been awarded India's highest honor Bharat Ratna and Pakistan's highest honor nishan-e-pakistan
 vah 81 varsh kii aayu main pradhanmantri bane the
 Before this he tried many times to become Prime Minister but was unsuccessful
 lekin aisa nahin hai ki morarji pradhanmantri banane ke qaabil nahin the
 In fact, he was unfortunate that despite being the senior-most leader, he was not made Prime Minister even after the deaths of Pandit Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri
 morarji desai march 1977 main desh ke pradhanmantri bane lekin pradhanmantri ke rup main inkaa kaarykaal purna nahin ho paaya
 He had to quit as Prime Minister due to differences with Chaudhary Charan Singh
 morarji desai kaa janm 29 farvari 1896 ko gujarat ke bhadeli naamak sthaan par hua tha
 He belonged to a Brahmin family
 unke pita ranchhodji desai bhavnagar main ek skool adhyaaapak the
 He was suffering from depression, so he ended his first jump by jumping in the well
 pita kii mrityu ke tisare din morarji desai kii shaadi hui thi
 Morarji Desai was educated at Elphinstone College in Mumbai, which was considered expensive and expensive at the time
 mumbai main morarji desai ni:shulk awaas grih main rahe jo gokuldaas tejpal ke naam se prasiddh tha
 At one time, 40 students could live there
 vidhyaarthee jivan main morarji desai ausat buddhi ke vivekshil chaatr the
 He was also made the secretary of the college's debate team, but Morarji himself would hardly have participated in any debate competition
 morarji desai ne apane college jivan main hi mahatma gandhi, bal gangadhar tilak or anya congressi netaaon ke sambhaavnon ko suna tha
 Morarji Desai made up his mind to apply for the Mumbai Provincial Civil Service where direct recruitment was done by the government
 july 1917 main unhone uniwarsity training course main pravishti pai
 Here they continued to have the same rights and facilities as British people
 yahan rahete hue morarji afasar ban gaye
 In May 1918, he reached Ahmedabad on probation as a Deputy District Magistrate
 unhone chetfield naamak british colector ke antargat kaary kiya
 Morarji could not achieve special progress due to his dry nature for 11 years and the post of personal assistant of the collector reached the bottom
 morarji desai ne 1930 main british sarkaar kii naukari chhod di or swatantraaa sangram ke sipaahi ban gaye
 In 1931, he became the Secretary of the Congress Committee of Gujarat Pradesh
 unhone akhil bhartiya yuva congress kii shakha sthapit kii or sardaar patel ke nirdesh par uske adhyaksh ban gaye
 In 1932 Morarji had to face two years of jail
 morarji 1937 tak gujarat pradesh congress cameti ke sachiv rahe
 He then joined the Congress cabinet of Bombay State
 is dauraan yah mana jaataa rahaa ki morarji desai ke vyaktitatva main jatiltaayen hai
 He himself puts his point above and believes it right
 is kaaran log inhen vyangy se 'sarvocch netaa' kaha karte the
 Morarji also liked to be said so
 gujarat ke samachar patron main praaia: unke is vyaktitv ko lekar vyangy bhi prakashit hote the
 His cartoons were depicted with a long stick in which he was also shown wearing a Gandhi cap
 isamen vyangy yah hota tha ki gandhiji ke vyaktitv se prabhavit lekin apni baat par ade rahane vaale ek ziddi vyakti
 Morarji Desai's many years passed in the districts due to his participation in the freedom struggle
 desh kii azaadi ke samay rashtriya raajnneeti main inkaa naam vazandaar ho chukaa tha
 But Morarji's primary interest was in state politics
 yahi kaaran he ki 1952 main inhen bombai kaa mukhyamantri banaaya gaya
 By this time Gujarat and Maharashtra were known as Bombay Province and the two states were not formed separately
 1967 main indira gandhi ke pradhanmantri banane par morarji ko up pradhanmantri or grih mantri banaaya gaya
 But he was frustrated that Indira Gandhi was made the Prime Minister instead of being a senior Congress leader
 yahi kaaran he ki indira gandhi dwaara kiye jane vaale krantikari upayon main morarji nirantar baadha daalate rahe
 In fact, Morarji was also in the race for Prime Minister when Mr
 Kamaraj announced Indira Gandhi as Prime Minister on the advice of Syndicate
 jab vah kisi bhi tarah nahin maane to party ne is mudde par chunaav karaayaa or indira gandhi ne baari matantar se baazi maar lee
 Indira Gandhi gave him the post of Deputy Prime Minister to appease Morarji's ego
 pandit jawahar laal nehru ke samay congress main jo anushaasan tha, vah unki mrityu ke baad bikharane laga
 Many members considered themselves larger than the party
 morarji desai bhi unamem se ek the
 Mr
 Lal Bahadur Shastri acted like a loyal soldier of the Congress Party
 unhone party se kabhi bhi kisi pad kii maang nahin kii thi
 But Morarji Desai remained the exception in this case
 congress sanghathan ke saath unke matbhed jagazahir the or desh kaa pradhanmantri bananaa inaki praathamiktaaon main shaamil tha
 When Indira Gandhi understood that Morarji Desai was causing difficulties for her, she started clashing on Morarji
 is kaaran unka kshubdh hona swaabhaavik tha
 In November 1969, when the Congress was split into congress-r and congress-o, Morarji Desai moved to Indira Gandhi's congress-i instead of congress-o
 phir 1975 main vah janata party main shaamil ho gaye
 When the Lok Sabha elections were held in March 1977, the Janata Party got a clear majority
 parantu yahan par bhi pradhanmantri pad ke do anya daavedaar upasthit the-choudhary charan singh or jagjivan ram
 But Jayaprakash Narayan, who was once a Congressman himself, supported Morarji Desai, taking advantage of his position as King Maker
 iske baad 23 march 1977 ko 81 varsh kii avasthaa main morarji desai ne bhartiya pradhanmantri kaa daayitv grahan kiya
 In the early period of his prime ministership, the governments of the nine states in the country where the Congress ruled were dissolved and new elections were announced in the states
 yah aloktantric or asanvaidhanik kaary tha
 The Janata Party, Indira Gandhi and her supported Congress were determined to sweep the country
