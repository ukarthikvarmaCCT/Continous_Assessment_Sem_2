mote taur par sach bolnaa, chori na karnaa, duusare ke dhan yaa jivan kaa apharan na karnaa, pita, mata tathaa gurujanon kaa aadar, kamvasana par niyantran, yahi moulik naitikta he jiskaa har samaaj main paalan hota he or jiske vipareet kaam karnaa aparaadh he
 Dr
 Lambrozo of Italy was the first scribe who tried to identify the 'criminal' rather than the crime
 pheri samaajavigyaan dwaara aparaadh ho, chaahe koi bhi kare, kisi bhi paristhiti main kare, uskaa or koi kaaran nahin, keval yahi kaha ja saktaa he ki vyaktigat swatantra ichha se kiya gaya he yaa prakritik yaa swaabhaavik kaarnon kaa parinnam he
 Garofalo considered crime a matter of psychology: according to him, there are four types of criminals - murderers, violent criminals, criminals against property, and criminals of lust
 garophalo ke mat se prandand, aajanm karagaar yaa deshnikala, ye hi teen sajaayen honi chahie
 Fon Haamel raised the discussion of criminal reform for the first time
 france ke pandit tarmde ne naitik jimmedaari, 'vyaktigat vishistataa' kii charchaa kii
 According to him, man is just a set of his consciousness and conscience
 uske kaaryon se jise dukh pahunche yani jiske prati aparaadh kiya jaay usko bhi samaan rup se saamaajik ekta ke prati sachet karnaa chahie
 France's state revolution declared 'human rights'
 apradhi bhi manushya hai
 He too has some natural rights
 isliye apradhi aparaadh kii vyakhya chaahate he
 The most obvious interpretation of this was given by the French Penal Code of 1934
 aparaadh vahi he jise kanuunan manaa kiya gaya ho
 The thing which is denied in the then environment is the crime
 kintu, kanuunan nazaij kaam karnaa hi aparaadh nahin rah gaya he
 The point which Dr
 Gutner had raised has become a great subject for every court today
 vahi aparaagh he
 If while flying a kite on the roof, a stone comes down on the road from a boy's foot and falls on the head of another person, then that boy is not guilty of murder
 atev mahatv kii vastu niyat he
 Real justice can only be done by mixing the crime and its intention to commit it
 kintu samajashaastra ke panditonke saamne yah samasya bhi thi or he ki samaaj kii haani karanevaal ke saath vyavhaar kaisaa ho
 Aflatoon was of the opinion that it is unfair to harm the harm
 prasiddh samaaj-shastri jivik ne spasht kaha tha ki nyaay kabhi nahin chahta ki bhul karanevaal yani aparaadh karanwane ko pidaa pahunchaai jaae
 Lord Haldane also advised not to consider crime, but to consider the criminal, his problems, his environment
 britain ke prasiddh raajnneetijna tathaa kai baar praghan mantri bananevaale winston churchill kaa kathan he ki aparaadh tathaa apradhi ke prati janata kii kisi bhaavana tathaa drushti he, usee se us desh kii sabhyataa kaa vaastavik anumaan lag saktaa he
 British law considers the same act to be a crime that is done ill-favorably, voluntarily, cunningly, done, allowed or allowed
 bahut se aparaadh aise hote hai jo aparaadh hone ke karan hi aparaadh nahin samajhe jate
 For example, gene type marriages are illegal in the UK, so even if married, it would not be considered a marriage, such as marrying a girl under 16, etc
 naveen audyogic sabhyataa main aparaadh kaa rup tathaa prakaar bhi badal gaya he
 New types of crimes have started happening which are difficult to imagine
 isliye aparaadh kii pahchaan ab is samay yahi he ki kanoon ne jis kaam ko manaa kiya he, vah aparaadh he
 The one who has done the forbidden work is the culprit
 kintu, apradhi paristhiti kaa das ho saktaa he, vivash ho saktaa he, isliye use pahchaanane kaa praytn karnaa hoga
 Today's criminology does not believe that someone has become a worshiper by learning from the stomach or someone is deliberately making it his 'life'
 har ek aparaadh kaa tathaa har ek apradhi kaa adhyayan hona chahie
 That is why every crime and every criminal has become the subject of personal study, personal diagnosis and personal medicine
 manovigyaan aparaadh ko manushya kii maansik ulajhanon kaa parinaam maanata he
 a person whose childhood does not pass in an atmosphere of love and encouragement, many types of mental glands of inferiority are formed in his mind
 in grathiyon main uski man main uski bahut si maansik shakti sanchit rahati he
 Dr
 Alfred Adler states that a person who has mental glands of inferiority in his mind inevitably commits many kinds of crimes
 yah aparaadh vah isliye karata he ki swayan ko vah duusare logon se adhik balavaan siddh kar sake
 The gland of inferiority remains in the mind in this person, he is always in a state of inner mental dissatisfaction
 vah sab samay aise kaamon main apane ko lagaae rahata he jisase sabhi log uski ore dekhen or uski prashansa kare
 The mental gland of inferiority puts man in such works, due to which the human being has to hear many kinds of condemnation
 es vyakti swayan ko sadaa charchaa kaa vishay banaae rakhana chahta he
 If it is not discussed for good works then it should be for bad works
 uski maansik granthi use shant man nahin rahane detii
 She always inspires him to do special work
 yadi aise vyakti ko dand kiya jaae to isse uskaa sudhaar nahin hota, apitu isse uski maansik granthi or bhi jatil ho jaati he
 The treatment of such a criminal requires a mental doctor
 aadhunik manovigyaan ne hamen bataaya he ki samaaj main aparaadh ko kam karne ke liye dandvidhaan ko kadaa karnaa paryaapt nahin he
 For this education is required in the society
 jab manushya kii koi pravriti bachapan se hi prabal ho jaati he to aage chalkaar vah vishesh prakaar ke kaaryo main prakashit hoti he
 These works are beneficial for the society or are anti-social
 samajavirohi kaary hi hamen vyakti ke prati uchit drushtikon rakhana hoga
 The child who is kept dearly and is allowed to do all kinds of things, does not have the ability to relinquish his happiness for the happiness of others
 es vyakti kii saamaajik bhavanaayen aviksit rah jaati he
 Life does not create goodness
 iske kaaran vah na to samaajik drushti se bhale bure kaa vichaar kar saktaa he ore na bure kaamon se swayan ko rokane kii kshamta praapt kar paata he
 The parents of the child and the surrounding air conditioners and schools work in it
 uchit shiksha kaa ek uddeshy yahi he ki balak apane upar sanyam kii kshamta aa jaae
 The higher the state of self-control, the less the crime
 samaaj main bahut se log apane vivek se pratikul aparaadh karte hai
 What is the reason for this? According to the discoveries of modern psychology, the childhood of such people would not have passed properly
 ye log buddhi main to janm se hi praveen the atev ye anek prakaar ke vichaaron ko jaan sake
 But they did not have such permanent feelings in their mind in their childhood so that they can stop themselves from doing inappropriate work
 ye sthaayee bhav jab tak manushya ke swabhaav ke ang nahin ban jate tab tak ve manushya ko duraachaar se rokane kii kshamta nahin dete
 Such scholars commit crimes and even curse themselves for them
 isse ve apni maansik ulajhanein badha lete hai
 Sometimes they use their scholarship to prove the morality of their unfair actions
 inkaa sudhaar saamaanya dandvidhaan se nahin ho paata
 They devise many ways to avoid them
 aise logon ko sudhaarney ke liye aavashyak he ki shiksha kaa dhyey aajeevika kamanaa athwa vyavahaarakushalata praapt kar lenaa na hokar maanav vyaktitv kaa sampurna vikaas arthath bauddhik or bhavatmak vikaas ho
 When a person starts to see his own interest in the interest of others and gets the ability to conduct according to this idea, then only he is a qualified citizen of the society
 aisa vyakti jab kuch karata he, vah samaaj ke hit ke liye hi hota he
 Crime is a type of social asymmetry
 yah vyaktigat maansik vishmata kaa parinaam he
 This type of asymmetry starts in childhood
 iske sudhaar ke liye prarambh main aadat daalani padati he ki vah dusron ke sukh main nij sukh kaa anubhav kare
 He should do such things which will benefit everyone and praise him
 hindu dharamshastron ke anusaar saamanyatya chalit dharamshastra ke niyam, saamaajik niyam or rajanium ke viruddh aacharan karnaa hi aparaadh hai
 The field of Hindu theology is very broad, under which the idea of violation of all kinds of rules, economic, political, social etc
 is available
 isi ke anusaar hindu dharamshastron main saamaanya rup se 32 prakaar ke aparaadh bataae gaye hai
 The number of them can also be more because the nature of these crimes also varies according to the variation of country, time and society
 isliye bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke vichaar vyakt karte dikhaai padate hai
 Hindu theology or memoir appears to express different views regarding crimes and their punishments
 hindu dharamshastra ke antargat aparaadh ke swaroop par vichaar karne ke liye manu, yajyavlky, parashar, naarad, brihaspati, katyayan aadi ko pramaan mana jaataa hai
 In considering the crime from a mental point of view, Lambrozo had said long ago that the body of a criminal has a special shape
 parantu us samay unke mat ko manyata nahin mili
 Recently some experiments were conducted on criminals which concluded that 60 percent of the criminals have abnormal body designs
 raktakoshika main rahanevaale 23 gunasutra yugmon main se aparaadhiyon kaa 21vaan gunasutra yugma asaamaanya paaya gaya
 In 1968, an argument was made in a court of Celadan against a man, the murderer of his four children, that my chromosome is super-primitive, that is, the sequence of chromosomes in my blood cells is 'XY', which caused my crime psychosis
 It is natural and i have murdered my children to abdicate responsibility in an abnormal mental state
 nyaayalay ne faisle main yadhyapi uski asaamaanya maansik shaareerik banaavat kaa ullekh nahin kiya gaya to bhi asaamaanya dasha ke aadhaar par apradhi ko chhod diya gaya
 In 1969, Dr
 Hargovind Khurana received the Nobel Prize by rendering the genetic signal theory according to which the behavior of a person depends on the structure of his gene group and the structure of the gene group is based on heredity
 faltah apradhi manovritatti ricth main bhi praapt ho sakati hai
 2393 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 2393 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar

 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus

 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya calendar he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows- uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 2393 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate he

 Courtesy of the school, pictures are taken while bathing Anju through cellphones hidden in the bathroom during Nature Camp
 joki aaropee sam urf samir kii harakat hai jo swayan goa police kii pramukh inspector mira deshmukh kaa betaa he
 Sam blackmails Anju for coitus in Vijay's absence on vacation
 nandini bich-bachaav karte hue uske parivaar ko chhodane kii yachana karti hai
 But Sam's intention deteriorates upon seeing Nandini and insists Nandini sleep with him instead of Anju
 achaanak anju sam ke haathon uske mobile chhinane ke anjaane prayaas main ek joardaar waar uske sir par maar detii hai jisase sam kii tatkaal maut hoti he
 Horrified Anu sees both of them hiding bodies in the manure pit
 agali subah, nandini beeti raat kaa sara vakya vijay ko bataati he or tab vijay apane parivaar ko police se kisi tarah bachaane kii yukti lagaataa he
 This involved hiding a SIM phone and Sam's car, but in this effort, co-inspector Laxmikant Gaitonde sees him who is in awe of Vijay
 vijay panajim ke safar main sam ke mobile sim or car ko thikaane lagaakar agle din phir apane parivaar sang panajim main film dekhne or restaraan main khaane ghoomane jaataa he
 At the same time, Meera starts investigating the case after Sam's missing car was found by the police
 mira praarambhik jaanch ke pehle vijay or uske parivaar se ghatana ke din sambandhit sawaal karti he
 Vijay was aware that the police would investigate the case of chance from him and the family

 Meera forcefully takes Vijay and his family into custody and with Gayatonde tries to ruthlessly extract the truth
 aakhirkaar, annu maar ke dar se shav chipaaye jane ke sthaan kaa pataa bataati he
 Then, in the digging of the same manure pit, they find the corpse of the damaged calf, which indicates the removal of the actual dead body by Vijay
 vijay ain vakt main media ke samaksh gayatonde ke viruddh shikaayat darj karata he or acroshit bheed dwaara gayatonde kii pitayee karaata he
 As a result, Meera resigns from the post of co-inspector Gayatonde
 jab nandini shav chupaane kii ghatana vijay se puchhati hai to vah uske liye bematlab bataakar inkaar karata he or shav ke bare main anjaan bane rahane main swayan kii behatari samajhaata he
 While calling Vijay away in seclusion, Meera and Mahesh apologize for their rude and barbaric behavior, but Vijay himself expresses regret about the unknown incident of that 'non-invited guest'
 vijay inhen yaadon ke baad navnirmit sthaneey police thane main hajiri chadhaane pahunchataa he
 At the same time, the new station in-charge challenges Vijay to find the dead body in a threatening tone

 ) Are the following basic natural phenomena from which organisms are identified: sanghathan - yah ucchstareey praaniyon main adhik spasht he
 There is a parallel in the development of structure and action, proving the physiologists' statement that structure is the defining factor of action
 vyakti ke vibhinn bhaagon main sookshm sahyog hota he, jisase praani kii aasapaas ke vaataavaran ke anukool banane kii shakti badhati he
 Energy Consumption - Organisms dissolve energy

 Continuous expenditure of energy is necessary for these physical activities
 bhojan athwa oxigen ke abhaav main sharir ke kriyakalapon kaa ant ho jaataa he
 When there is a need for more energy in the body, it is met by high amounts of food and oxygen

 The process of growth lasts for a certain time, after which each organism divides and a fraction of it separates to form one or several new individuals
 inamen prayek un sabhi gunon se yukt hota he jo mul jeev main hote hai
 In all high quality organisms, the original organism begins to degrade and eventually succumbs to death

 Paradigm - In structure and physiological properties, animals of the same race are very similar, and this tendency oriented towards the standard form of bio-traits is an expression of the adjacent harmony between the organism and its environment
 ek hi janak se, ek hi samay main, utpann praaniyon main yah samanta sarvaadhik hoti he
 As we consider the similarities of beings of other races, the distinction between them increases and the difference in the classification of beings at the ends of the fauna is so great that their comparison is unclear
 phir bhi, vyashti praaniyon main jahaan bahut nikat kaa sambandh hota he, jaise manushya jati main, vahiin inamen antar bhi spasht hota he
 It is the duty of human physiology to study the general human person, as this creates an important ground for the study of the disease, but it is difficult to say what the natural nature of a presenting symptom is
 iske atirikt sabhi sharirkriyaatmak prayogon ke parinaamon main paryaapt spasht antar pradarshit hota he, jo prayojya praaniyon kii vyattigat prakruti par nirbhar karata he
 That is why important proper controls and significant results should not be overvalued

 Repeats of experiments are necessary
 prekshan kii truti, jo yatharth vigyaanon main praaia: alp hoti he, jaiviki main bahut adhik hoti he, kyonki parivarti vyashti ke kaaran prekshan main parivartanshiltaa aa jaati he
 Just as in other sciences, results are judged by statistics, Physiology is judged by the application of the law of probability of results

 Since the history of its development must be known in order to understand the current state of a science, it is necessary for a person interested in physiology to be familiar with the outline of its history
 jahaan tak samgr vishay ke vikaas kaa prashn he, yah dhyaan rakhane kii baat he ki vigyaan kaa koi ang alag se viksit nahin ho saktaa, sabhi bhaag ek duusare par nirbhar karte hai
 For example, it was impossible to imagine physiology without knowledge of the body to a certain extent, and similarly its progress was impossible even without a developed state of physics and chemistry to a certain extent

 chandragomin prasiddh buddha vaiyaakaran the
 He was considered the originator of the famous book called 'chandra Grammar'
 inke anya prasiddh naam the 'chandra' or 'chandracharya'
 Their time is definitely predecessor to Jayaditya and Vamana's 'kashika' and Bhartrihari's 'syntactic'
 kashikasutravriti main inke anek niyamasutra bina namollekh ke gruhit hai
 It is mentioned in the sentence verse that the grammar which was destroyed in the disciple tradition of Pantjali was reproduced in many branches by Chandracharyadi

 Therefore, the time of Chandragomin is generally considered to be around 470 AD

 His treatise, which is basically Sutra, but on which written scriptures are also probably from him, is Chandra Grammar
 paninipurvavarti alabdh chandra vyakaran se yah bhinn he
 It is permissible that Chandracharya composed this lunar grammar to teach Buddhists
 isamen vaidic bhashaa prayog prakiya kaa vyakarnansh nahin he
 There can be many reasons for this
 buddha hone ke kaaran kadachit chandragomin ne brahmandharmanuayiyon ke dharmagranth ko unheen kaa dharmik-saanskarik vaanmay samajhakar ukt bhashaa kaa vyakaran nirmaan anaavashyak samajha ho
 It may also be that the interpretations of thousands of years old Vedic Sanskrit language interpretations have not been considered to be of much purpose - especially for Buddhist Sanskrit philologists

 The composition of this grammar book is the first such great attempt that we can call a revisionary revision of Panini Ashtadhyayi
 aisa doosraa mahaprayas he bhojraj kaa 'saraswatikanthabharan' naamak vyakarangranth 
 In this, the complete suggestions and amendments of Katyayan and Patanjali's pragmatic and superlative have often been adopted

 For this reason, this sect is also called 'ignorant' grammar
 phir bhi, nishchit rup se iskaa mul dhaanchaa ashtaadhi ke sarvadhar par hi nirmit he
 Most of the sutras of this grammar are of Ashtadhyayi or are variations of Ashtadhyayi sutras

 Some new formulas have also been created for the new applications prevalent in chronology
 isi sutarasankhya lagbhag 3100 he
 It is said that in the grammar form, Chandragomin also composed the Unadipatha, Dhanapatha, Ganapatha, Lingarkarika, Varnasutra and Prefixes, in which Unadisuchi and Dhanatpakatha have been published along with the 'chandravikaran' treatise
 'varnasutra' main panineey shiksha ke samaan sutron main varno ke sthaan praytn kaa vivaran he
 Apart from 'chandravyakaranasutravriti', Chandracharya also has the distinction of producing religious scriptures 'shishyalekh' and 'lokanand' drama, which are not much importance

avani chaturvedi E-learning is defined as all types of electronically supported learning and pedagogy, which are inherently functional and aimed at influencing the learner's personal experience, practice and knowledge in the context of knowledge
 soochna evam sanchaar pranaliyaan, chaahe inamen network kii vyavastha ho yaa na ho, shiksha prakriya ko karyanvit karne vaale vishesh madhyam ke rup main apni seva pradaan karti hai
 E-education is essentially a computer and network enabled transfer of skills and knowledge
 i-shiksha electronic anuprayogon or seekhney kii prakriyaaon ke upyog ko sanderbhit karata he
 Applications and processes of e-learning include web-based learning, computer-based learning, virtual classrooms, and digital collaboration
 paathya-samagriyon kaa vitaran internet, intranet / extranet, audio yaa video tepe, upgrah tivi or sidi-rome ke madhyam se kiya jaataa he
 It can be done by itself or under the leadership of an instructor and the medium is text, image, animation, streaming video and audio
 i-shiksha ke samanarthak shabdon ke rup main sibiti, ibiti yaa dablubity jaise sankshipt shabd-roopon kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 Even today one can see the use of the above words along with various forms of e-learning, such as elearning, elearning and elearning
 online study i-shiksha isse jude sanghathanon evam vyaktiyon ko laabh pradaan kar saktaa he
 Additional benefits of computer-based training over traditional classroom training include the ability to do the following: roodhiwaadee anumaanon ke anusaar vishwavyaapee i-shiksha udyog kaa mulya adtis billian euro se adhik hone kaa anumaan he, haalanki aam bazaar ke bheetar europea sangh main i-shiksha utpaadon main se keval lagbhag 20% utpaadon kaa hi utpaadan hota he
 The development of Internet and multimedia technologies are the basic enablers of e-education, with consulting, content, technology, service and support identified as the five core areas of the e-education industry
 san 2006 tak sanyukt rajya america main ucch shiksha sansthaanon main online shiksha main bhaag lene vaale chaatro kii sankhya 3

 According to reports from the Sloan Foundation, the average enrollment for fully online education in the five years from 2004 to 2009 increased by approximately 12 to 14 percent per year in the US postgraduate system compared to an average of about 2 percent per year

 Thus it can be seen that e-education is rapidly crossing its borders to become a major form of post-secondary education, at least in the United States

 It may be that private institutions start taking more interest in these online presentations because the cost of installing such a system is low
 chaatro ke saath online kaam karne ke liye acchhee tarah se prashikshit karmiyon ko hi kaam par rakhana chahie
 These employees need to understand the content area and they also need to be highly trained in the use of computers and the Internet

 Early e-learning systems based on computer-based learning / trainees often attempted to replicate autocratic teaching styles so that the role of the e-education system evolved later on the basis of computer-supported collaborative learning that encouraged the shared development of knowledge
 Transfer of knowledge against systems was considered
 1993 ke bilkul armbh main wiliam di

 There is a tendency to move towards blended learning services where computer-based activities are integrated with practical or classroom-based situations
 bets evam pool or oisidi kaa suzav he ki vibhinn prakaar yaa rup ke i-shiksha ko koi i-shiksha nahin, arthath adhyaapan evam shiksha ke liye computer or / yaa internet kaa koi upyog nahin, se lekar kaksha sahaayta, jaise - ek paathyakram yaa shiksha prabandhan pranali ke madhyam se chaatro ke liye kaksha vyaakhyaan ke powerpoint slide ko uplabdh karana, se hote hue laptop program, jahaan chaatro ko kaksha main laptop laane or unhen aamane-saamne kaksha ke bhaag ke rup main istemaal karne kii jarurat padati he or sankar shiksha, jahaan kaksha ke samay ko kam kiya jaataa he na ki ise khatm kiya jaataa he or saath main sampoorn rup se online shiksha ke madhyam se online shiksha ke liye adhik samay samarpit kiya jaataa he, jo duurastha shiksha kaa hi ek rup he, tak ek satatyak mana ja saktaa he
 This classification is somewhat similar to the Sloan Commission's report classification based on the state of e-education, which refers to web-enhanced, web-complementary and web-based learning to reflect the increasing intensity of technology use
 bets evam pool ke satatyak main, 'mishrit shiksha' main kaksha sahaayta, laptop evam sankar shiksha samahit ho saktaa he, jabaki 'vitarit shiksha' main yaa to sankar yaa sampoorn rup se online shiksha shaamil ho saktaa he
 So it can be seen that e-education can describe a wide range of applications and it is not even clear in peer reviewed research publications what kind of e-education is being discussed
 haalanki, bets evam pool kaa tark he ki jab anudeshak yah kehete hai ki ve i-shiksha kaa istemaal kar rahe hai, to yah aksar zyaadaatar kaksha sahaayta ke rup main praudyogiki ke upyog ko hi sanderbhit karata he, haalanki samay ke saath sampoorn online shiksha main ek kramik vruddhi bhi hui he 
 Computer-based learning, sometimes abbreviated as CBL, refers to the use of computers as a core component of the educational environment
 jabaki yah ek kaksha main computaron ke istemaal ko sanderbhit kar saktaa he, yah shabd or adhik vyapak taur par ek sanrachanaatmak vaataavaran ko sanderbhit karata he jisamen adhyaapan ke prayojanon ke liye computaron kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 This concept is generally seen as distinct from the use of computers in ways where education is at least a peripheral element of experience
 computer-aadhaarit prashiksha ek computer yaa hastchalit upkaran ke madhyam se sulabh swa-sanchalit shiksha gatividhiyaan hai
 CBT typically presents materials in a linear fashion much like reading an online book or manual
 isi vajah se inkaa istemaal aksar sthir prakriyaaon ko sikhaane ke liye kiya jaataa he, jaise - software kaa istemaal karnaa yaa ganitiya sameekaran ko puraa karnaa
 In terms of interchangeability, computer-based trainee nouns are often used with web-based trainees, whose primary difference is their delivery method
 jahaan sibiti ko aam taur par sidi-rome ke madhyam se vitarit kiya jaataa he, vahiin dablubity ko ek web brouzar kaa istemaal kar internet ke madhyam se vitarit kiya jaataa he
 In CBT, the assessment of education appears as multiple choice questions or other assessment that can be easily typed by a computer, such as a drag and drop, radial button, simulation or other interactive means
 ant-upyogkarta kii tatkaal pratikriya evam purnataa kii sthiti kii soochna pradaan kar moolyankan ko online software ke madhyam se aasaani se ankit or darj kiya ja saktaa he

 sibiti pathyapustak, niyampustika, yaa kaksha-aadhaarit shiksha ke paaramparik shiksha paddatiyon se kaaphi alag tarah kii shiksha prerana pradaan karte hai
 For example, cbts provide a user-friendly solution for satisfactory fulfillment of continuing education needs
 chaatro ko paathyakram main bhaag lene yaa mudrit niyampustikaon ko padhane se simit karne ke bajaay, chaatr un tareekon ke madhyam se gyaan or kaushal praapt karne main sakasham hote hai jo vyaktigat shiksha variyataon ke liye bahut adhik anukool hote hai
 For example, cbts provide visual education benefits through animation or video, which are typically not achieved by any other means
 sibiti mudrit shiksha samagriyon kaa ek acha vikalp ho saktaa he kyonki shiksha main vruddhi karne ke liye video yaa anemeshan samet sampann madhyam ko badi aasaani se antahsthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 Another advantage of CBT is that once the initial development work is completed, they can be easily distributed to a wider audience at a relatively low cost
 haalanki, sibiti saath main kuch shiksha chunautiyon ko bhi janm detii hai
 Generally, the creation of effective CBT requires considerable resources
 sibiti yaa adob diarector ) ko viksit karne ke liye istemaal kiya jane vaala software aksar ek vishay-vastu visheshgy yaa shikshak kii upyog kshamta kii tulana main adhik jatil hota he
 Furthermore, the lack of human interaction may limit the type of content that can be presented as well as the type of evaluation that can be demonstrated
 kai shiksha sanghathan ek vyapak online program ke bhaag ke rup main chote-chote sibiti / dablubity gatividhiyon kaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar rahe hai jisamen online charchaa yaa anya sanvadatmak tatv shaamil ho sakate hai

 Modifiable elements are an attempt to define the structure or units of educational materials
 udhaaharan ke liye, yah ek sabak, ek kaam, ek bahuviklpi prashn, ek prashnottaree, ek charchaa samooh yaa ek maamle kaa adhyayan ho saktaa he
 The format of these units must be independent, although it can be in one of the following ways, so that the modular structures do not include a textbook, web page, video conference, or podcast
 i-shiksha ke samagriyon ke nirmaan kaary shuru karne ke samay sanshaikshik drushtikonon kaa moolyankan karnaa jaruri he
 Simple inflexible approaches make the manufacture of these materials easy but they lack flexibility, richness and transverse functionality

 The construction of a syllabus needs to keep the order of education items together
 shiksha vastuon kii malikana evam mukt, gaiyr-vanijyik evam vanijyik, donon tarah kii sahakarmi-samikshyit sangrah, jaise - merlot sangrah, uplabdh hai
 a common standard format of e-learning content is SCORM while other specifications allow the classification of "education objects" (transfer or metadata)
 ye maanak swayan paripakvata kii prakriya main aarambhik he or isamen se sabase purana maanak keval 8 varsh purana hi he
 They are also relatively vertical: the sif is predominantly PK-12, the loam is predominantly corp, military and higher ed, and the skorm is mainly military and corp with some higher aids

 The American PK12 location has a number of content standards that are quite important and the NCES data standard is a prime example of this

 a classic example of e-education related to knowledge management and reusability is Navy e-learning, available to active duty, retired, or disabled military members

 Their population worldwide has been estimated at 7 million, of which 5
5 million live in Russia

 Tatar communities outside Russia are found in Uzbekistan, Poland, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, China, and the United States

 Under his leadership, his grandson Batu Khan, he became a part of the golden Urdu empire and went west where he ruled the steppes of Eurasia in the 14th and 15th centuries
 europe main unka mishran sthaneey jatiyon se hua, jaise kii kipachak log, kimak log or urali bhashaayen bolne vaale log
 They mixed with the people of some ancient Greek colonies in Crimea and also with the castes there in the caucus
 siberia ke tartar ural-altaai kshetra ke turki log hai jo kuch had tak urali-bhashiyon or mongol logon ke saath mishrit hai
 There are three branches of Tatar people in the west: Volga Tatar, Lipka Tatar and Crimean Tatar
 tathari logon main madhya-kaal main islam dharm apana liya tha
 The word ‘tatar’ has had different expressions at different times
 kuch logon kaa vichaar he ki pracheen kaal main madhya asia kii tartar naamak nadi ke sambandh se tartar kahe jane lage
 On the contrary, some say that Tatar was actually the name of a prince of Turkish race, whose brother was named Mongol
 is kaaran tartar rajkumaar ke vanshavaale tartar kahe jane lage or mongol rajkumaar ke vanshavaale mongol kehalaae
 New researches have proved both these approaches wrong but no definite facts have been known yet
 ab tak ke kul gyaat saakshyon main sabase pracheen aathvin shatee ke turki bhashaa ke urkhooni lekh hai jinamein "tees tataron" tathaa "nau tataron" kaa ullekh he
 It is also proved from the same articles that at that time this word was not related to Turks directly to Mongols or to any Mongol branch
 us kaal main tartar bykele jhil ke dakshin-pashchim main based hue the or uttuukan pradesh, jiskaa ullekh urkhooni lekhon main turkon ke nivasasthaan ke rup main baar baar hua he, 11veen shatee isvin main tatariyon ke desh main sammilit tha
 At that time the mother tongue of the Tataris was different from the Turks but many of their communities moved to different places along with the Turks and to a extent all became Turks
 13veen shatee isvi main mongol vijayon ke samay china, rus, pashchimi europe tathaa islamic sansar main vijetaon ko tartar kehete the
 This name is also used for Genghis Khan's ancestors
 parantu changez khan kii vijayon ke ananthar bahut se log jinhone uski adheenta sweekaar kar lee thi, apane ko mongol kehane lage or changez khan ke rajya ke baad mongolia tathaa madhya asia main tartar shabd kaa prayog purnat: uth gaya tathaa usak sthan par 'mongol' shabd chal padaa, jise swayan changez khan ne shaskeey dhang se chalaaya tha
 Nevertheless, Europeans continued to call them Tatars and the people of Alatun Urdu state and later other rulers of this state were also called Tatars, even though they accepted the religion of Islam in the 14th century AD
 iske badwaale samay main rus tathaa pashchimi europe main usamaani turkon ke sivaa sabhi shuddh turkon ke liye 'tartar' shabd prayukt hone laga or chini mongolon ko bhi tartar kehane lage
 The word Tatar is now used as a specific ethnic name only for the Turkish barners in the vicinity of the Volga River, from Kazan to Astrakhan, settled in Crimea or Karim and a part of Siberia
