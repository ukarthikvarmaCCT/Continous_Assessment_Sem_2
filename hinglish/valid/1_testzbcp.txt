 So, he sent Rukmani's commentary to Shishupala
 rukmani krishna par aasakt thi isaliye usne krishna ko ek brahman ke haathon sandeshaa bheja
 Krishna said to the Brahmin who brought the message, "O Brahmin deity! i love him as much as Rukmini loves me
 main jaanata hoon ki rukmani ke mata-pita rukmani kaa vivaah mujhase hi karnaa chaahate hai parantu unka bada bhai rukm mujh se shatruta rakhane ke kaaran unhen aisa karne se roak rahaa he
 You go and tell Princess Rukmini that i will definitely marry her

 arjuna or bhimsen anek raajaaon ke saath use maarane ke liye udyat ho gayi kintu shri krishna ne un sabhi ko roak diya

" maine tere ek sau apshabdon ko kshamaa karne kii pratigya kii thi isi liye ab tak tere praan bache rahe
 "hearing these words of Shri Krishna, all the supporters of Shishupala present in the house were trembled with fear but the destruction of Shishupala was near, so he took the sword out of time and abused Shri Krishna again

 He was always absorbed in meditation
 kaha jaataa he ki unhone satya-sambandhi paramguhya gyaan ek kshan main mahakashyap main sampreshit kiya or yahi buddha dharm ke dhyaan sampradaay kii utpatti kaa kshan tha
 This knowledge was transmitted in joy from Mahakashyapa
 is tarah yah gyanadhara guru-shishy parampara se nirantar pravaahit hoti rahi
 In India, Bodhidharma became the twenty-seventh and last guru of this tradition
 uttari china ke tatkaaleen raja bu-ti ne unke darshan kii ichha kii
 He was a revered Buddhist worshiper
 unhone buddha dharm ke prachararth anek mahneey kaary kiye the
 Many stupas, viharas and monasteries were built and Sanskrit Buddhist texts were translated into Chinese

 Religion was organized in both of them as follows
 bu-ti-bhante - maine anek vihaar aadi kaa nirmaan karaayaa he tathaa anek buddha dharm ke sanskrit granthon kaa anuwaad karaayaa he tathaa anek vyaktiyon ko buddha bhikshu banane kii anumati pradaan kii he
 Have i benefited from these works? bodhidharm - bilkul nahin
 Boo-ti - What is real virtue? bodhidharm - vishuddh pragna, jo shunya, sookshm, purna evam shant he
 But the attainment of this virtue is not possible in the world
 bu-ti - sabase pavitra dharm siddhanth koun he? Bodhidharma - Where everything is nothing, nothing holy can be said there
 bu-ti - tab mere saamne khadaa koun baat kar rahaa he? Bodhidharma - i do not know
 uparyukt samvaad ke aadhaar par bodhidharm ek ruksh swabhaav ke vyakti siddh hote hai
 He did not even approve the virtuous works of the emperor
 baahar ke kathor dikhaai dene par bhi unke man main karunaa thi
 In fact, he told the king that donating, building viharas, etc
, are not more important, they are eternal
 is prakaar unhone samraat ko ahambhaav se bachaaya or shoonyata ke ucch satya kaa upadesh kiya, jo punya-paap pavitra-apavitra sat-asat aadi dvandvon or prapanchon se ateet he
 After seeing the above offering, Bodhidharma, seeing no benefit in staying there, crossed the yansi-tsi river and went to a kingdom called Bei in northern China
 iske baad unka adhiktar samay un rajya kii rajdhani lo-yaks ke sameep shug-shan parvat par sthit 'shaashv-shaanti' naamak vihaar main beetaa, jiskaa nirmaan paanchavin shatee ke purvarddh main hua tha
 Bodhidharma was enchanted as soon as he saw this magnificent vihara and folded hands and stood in front of the vihara for four days
 yaheen nau varsh tak rahete hue bodhidharm ne dhyaan kii bhaavana kii
 They stood in front of the wall
 yaheen nau varsh tak rahete hue bodhidharm ne dhyaan kii bhaavana kii
 He used to meditate facing the wall
 jis math main bodhidharm ne dhyaan kiya, vah aaj bhi bhagnavastha main vidyaman he
 Acharya Bodhidharma founded the meditation community in China on the surface of consciousness by remaining silent
 badi kathor pariksha ke baad unhone kuch adhikari vyaktiyon ko chunaa or apane man se unke man ko bina kuch bole shikshit kiya
 Later this meditation community developed in Korea and Japan
 bodhidharm ke pratham shishy or uttaradhikari kaa naam shain-kkang tha, jise shishy banane ke baad unhone hui-ke naam diya
 Previously he was a follower of Kunfusian religion
 bodhidharm kii kirti sunakar vah unka shishy banane ke liye aayaa tha
 He stood at the door for seven days and seven nights, but Bodhidharma was not allowed to meet
 jaade kii raat main maidan main khadey rahane ke kaaran barf unke ghutanon tak jam gai, phir bhi guru ne krupa nahin kii
 Then Shan-kkung cut off his left arm with a sword and appeared near the Guru with it and said that if he did not get discipleship, he would sacrifice his body too
 tab guru ne uski ore dhyaan dekar poocha ki tum mujhase kya chaahate ho? shain-kkang ne bilakhte hue kaha ki mujhe man kii shaanti chahie
 Bodhidharma said sternly that take your mind out in front of me, i will calm it down
 tab shain-kkang ne rote hue kaha ki main man ko kaise nikaal kar aap ko de saktaa hoon? is par kuch vinamr hokar karunaa karte hue bodhidharm ne kaha- main tumhaare man ko shant kar chukaa hoon
 Immediately Shan-qang experienced peace, all his doubts were dispelled, and intellectual conflicts were forever erased
 shain-kkang china main dhyaan sampradaay ke dwitiya dharmanayake hue
 Before departing from China, Bodhidharma called his disciples and asked about his achievements
 unamem se ek shishy ne kaha ki meri samaj main satya vidhi or nishedh donon se pare hai
 This is the way to communicate truth
 bodhidharm ne kaha- tumhen meri twachaa praapt he
 After this another monk disciple said that truth is seen only once, never again, Bodhidharma said that you have got my flesh
 iske baad tisare shishy ne kaha ki chaaron mahabhoot or paanchon skandh shunya hai or asat he
 There is no object acceptable in true form
 bodhidharm ne kaha ki tumhen meri haddiyaan praapt hai
 Finally, Hui-ke came and bowed and did not say anything, stood quietly in his place
 bodhidharm ne is shishy se kaha ki tumhen meri charbi praapt he
 Only after this did Bodhidharma enter
 antim baar jin logon ne unhen dekha, unka kahana he ki ve nange pair tsug-ling parvatashrenee main hokar pashchim kii ore ja rahe the or apana ek juuta haath main liye the
 Later, at the behest of these people, the tomb of Bodhidharma was opened in Loyang, but nothing other than a shoe was found in it
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki bodhidharm china se lautakar bharat aae
 Some in Japan believe that he traveled from China to Japan and was seen as a beggar in the city of katayoga-yama near Nara

 a collection of handwritten books was available in the ruins of the 'sahastra Buddha Guha Vihar' in the city of Tun-huan, China, with one copy pertaining to the discourses provided by Bodhidharma

 It was written by the disciples of Bodhidharma

 Nature is a great use in the realization of truth in the meditation community
 prakruti hi dhyani santon kaa shaastra he
 In the process of the attainment of knowledge, they resort to nature and as a result of its ingrained influence, it is possible to have an immediate incarnation of truth in consciousness
 bodhidharm ke vichaaron ke anusaar vastutatva ke gyaan ke liye pragna kii antardrushti kii aavashyak he, jo tathyata tak sidhe pravesh kar jaati he
 It does not require any argument or inference
 isamen na koi vishleshan he, na tulanaatmak chintan, na ateet evam anaagat ke bare main sochna he, na kisi nirnay par pahunchnaa he, apitu pratyaksh dekhnaa hi sab kuch he
 There is no space for resolution and choice

 ‘‘ atthasalini kii nidaan katha main bhi -pannasadhikani panchajatakasatani‘‘ he
 The number is broadly fixed
 jataka ke vartmaan rup main 547 jataka kahaniyaan pai jaati hai
 But this number is also only upper
 jatakatthawannanakaar ne vishaywastu kii drushti se inhen paanch virgon main vibhajit kiya he- Many of the Jataka stories are also found in two places with little variation or have been embedded in each other, and likewise many Jataka stories are found in sutta-pitaka, vinaya-pitaka, and other Pali texts, but In the present form of Jataka is not stored
 atah jaatakon kii sankhya main kaaphi kami kii bhi or briddhi kii bhi sambhaavna he
 For example, the story of Munik Jataka and Saluk Jataka is same, but only two names have come from different places
 iske vipareet ‘munik jataka’ naam ke do jataka hote hue unki bhi katha bhinn-bhinn he
 This is also the case for two people named Machh Jataka
 kahi-kahin do swatantra jaatakon ko milakar ek tisare jataka kaa nirmaan kar diya gaya he
 For example, both the Panchapandit Jataka and the Dakarakkhas Jataka are inhabited by the Maha Ummag Jataka
 jo kathaayen jataka-katha ke rup main anyatra pai jaati hai, kintu ‘jataka’ main sangruhit nahin he, unka bhi kuch ullekh kar dena aavashyak hoga
 The Ghatikar of the Majjhim body- Sutta or Ghatikar Sutta is one such Jataka story which is not found in 'jataka'
 isi prakaar dirghanikaay kaa mahagovind sutt jo swayan jataka kii nidaan katha main bhi ‘mahagovind jataka’ ke naam se nirdisht hua he, jataka ke andar nahin paaya jaataa he
 Similarly, in Dhammapadatthakatha and Milind Panha, some such Jataka-stories are quoted, which are not stored in Jataka
 atah kuch jataka nishchit rup se kitne he iskaa thik nirnay nahin ho saktaa
 When we consider the number of the Jataka, the Jataka means a story with a special title, which describes the life-related event of the Bodhisattva, no matter how many different stories are interwoven in that one
 Are given
 yadi kul kahaniyaan gini jaay to jataka main kareeb teen hajaar kahaniyaan pai jaati hai
 The Jatakas have in fact been compiled on the basis of sutta-pitaka and vinaya-pitaka
 sutt -pitak main anek aisi kathaayen he jinka upyog vahaan upadesh dene ke liye kiya gaya he
 But the Bodhisattva is not mentioned in it
 yah kaam baad main karke prayek kahani ko jataka kaa rup de diya gaya he
 Tittir Jataka and Dighit Kosal Jataka are similarly constructed from Chullavagg and Mahavagga respectively of vinaya-pitaka
 manikanth jataka bhi vinay-pitak par hi aadhaarit he
 Similarly, the Kootadanta Sutta and Mahasudassana Sutta of the long-body and the Makhadeva Sutta of the Majjhim body are also Jataka in full sense
 kam se kam 13 jaatkaan kii khoj vidwaanon ne sutt pitak or vinay-pitak main kii hai
 Although the stories related to Rajkatha chor-katha and similar fears, war, village, corporation, city, district, women, panaghat, ghost and ghost etc
 were seen in terms of helplessness in the monk's union by calling it sordid stories
 phir bhi upadesh ke liye kathaon kaa upyog bhikshu log kuch-na-kuch maatra main karte hi the
 God himself has also preached religion through similes and parables
 buddha sanskrit granth saddharmpundaree sutara ke dwitiya parivart main bhi kaha gaya he ki buddha anek drushtaanton se tathaa jataka ke dwaara sab praaniyon ke kalyanarth upadesh karte hai
 Apart from Buddha, other Indian saints have been preaching religions with the help of fables and parables from the time of the Upanishads to the time of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa
 isi pravriti ke aadhaar par jatakakathaon kaa vikaas hua he
 The stories prevalent in public society have also been taken somewhere, but they have been given a new moral form, which is a feature of Buddhism
 atah sabhi jataka kathaon par buddha dharm kii puri chhap he
 They may have the basis of folk lectures from earlier traditions, but their entire structure is compatible with the moral ideal of Buddhism
 buddha vachanon kaa vargeekaran nau angon ke rup main kiya gaya he, jinke naam hai- This nine types of division of the Buddha verses is only in terms of their style forms or patterns, not in terms of texts
 itane prakaar ke buddha upadesh hote the, yahi is vargeekaran kaa abhipraay he
 The division of the Buddha's verses into nine parts of which the number of Jataka is seventh is very ancient
 atah jataka kathaayen sarvansh main pali-sahitya ke mahatvapurn evam aavashyak ang hai
 Uncertainty about their numbers has arisen, especially due to their timely collection of Sutta Pitaka and vinaya-pitaka and other sources, and their own assortment of Pali Pitaka and their intermingling
 chull niddes main hamen keval 500 jaatakon kaa kaa ullekh miltaa he
 In the fifth century AD, Chinese traveler Fahyan saw pictures of 500 natives printed in Lanka
 dwitiya tritiy shatabdi isvi purv ke bharhut or sanchi ke stupon main jaatakon ke chitra ankit mili hai
 Out of which pictures of at least 27 or 29 natives were identified by Rais Davids
 tab se kuch anya jataka kahaniyon kii pahchaan bhi in stupon kii pashaan-veshtoniyon par kii ja chuki hai
 All these facts are indicative of the ancientness and development of the native
 sthaviravaadi pali sahitya ke samaan sanskrit buddha dharm ke granthon main bhi jataka kathaayen pai jaati hai
 Like the Nawang Buddha word of Pali, Dwad Sh Anga here is considered to be the scripture
 in donon hi jagah jataka ek ang yaa dharm-pravachan ke bhaag ke rup main vidyaman he
 In the Buddhist Sanskrit text Jatakamala, which is told the composition of Aryasur, 34 Jataka stories are found
 aryashur ko lamas, tarnath ne ashwaghosh kaa hi doosraa naam bataaya he parantu yah thik nahin jaan padataa he
 Probably he was a poet of the fourth century AD
 lokottaravaadiyon ke prasiddh granth mahavastu main jo 200 i0 purv se 400 i0 tak ke bich ke kaal main likhi gai, kareeb 80 jataka kathaayen milti he
 Some of them are similar to Pali Jataka and there are also some that are not found in Pali Jataka
 rais davids kaa kathan he ki jataka kaa sankalan or pranayan madhya desh main pracheen janakathaon ke aadhaar par hua
 Winternitz has also often expressed this view
 adhikansh jataka buddhakalin he
 The inscriptions of Sanchi and Bharhut's scenes on the stone-vestas give ample evidence of their pre-ashoka period
 jataka ke kaal or kartrutv ke sambandh main adhik prakaash uske saahitiyik rup or visheshtaon ke vivechan se padegaa
 Each Jataka tale is divided into five parts
 panchuppannavatthu kaa arth he vartmaan kaal kii ghatana yaa katha
 The incident that took place during the lifetime of Buddha is Pachauppannavatthu
 us ghatana ne bhagwaan ko kisi purvajanm ke vrut t ko kehane kaa avasar diya
 This is the circle of the past life is past
 prayek jataka kaa katha kii drushti sabase adhik mahatvapurn bhaag yah atitvatthu hi he
 According to this, Pachappannavatthu seems to have been built somewhere
 atitvatthu ke baad ek yaa anek gaathaayen aati hai
 Although they are related to the past only, but in some cases it is also related to the Pachappannavattu
 gaathaayen jataka ke pracheenatam ansh hai
 In fact only the gatakas are native
 pacchuppannavatthu aadi paanch bhaagon se samanvit jataka to vastav main jatakatthawannana yaa jataka main veyyakaran yaa atthav nnana aati he
 It contains interpretations and semantics of gathas
 sabase ant main samodhan aata he, jisamen atitvatthu ke paatro kaa buddha ke jivan kaal ke paatro ke saath sambandh milaayaa jaataa he, yatha us samay ataari par se shikaar khilne vaala shikari ab kaa dev dutt tha or kurung mrug to main tha hi, aadi aadi
 The Jataka contains the stories of the earlier births of the Buddha, while he completed various traditions in the form of the Bodhisattva and perfected his ability for enlightenment
 sutt-pitak ke pratham chaar nikaayon main buddha ke aitihaasik rup kii hi pratishtha he
 Later in the Jataka, they are able to relate their historical life to the earlier stories
 jatakatthakatha kii nidaan katha main buddha jivan ke teen nidaan bataaye gayi hai, duure nidaan main atyant dur ateet kii buddha jivan kii katha he, aisa mana jaataa he ki atyant sudur ateet main buddha sumedh tapasvi banakar utpann hue the
 At that time he showed great loyalty to Dipankar Buddha, as a result he later blessed him to be Buddha
 anek janmon tak vibhinn sharir dhaaran karte hue sume dha tapasvi kii sadhana chalati rahi
 In the end, after leaving his body as Vesantar king, he went to the illiterate world
 sumedh tapasvi ke rup se lekar tushit lok main jane tak kii buddha kii yah sadhana katha dur nidaan ke antargat he
 547 Jataka stories are related to this second diagnosis of Buddha biography from Apanaka Jataka to Vesantara Jataka
 in kathaon se yahan taatpary he inamen varnit atitvatthu
 They are related to the short diagnosis of the life story of Buddha i
e
 these are the stories of the past
 lumbini van main janm lene ke samay se lekar bodhi-prapti tak kii katha avidure nidaan se sambandhit he
 That is, she is not so far away from the past
 bodhi prapti se lekar nirvana prapti tak kii buddha jeevani santike nidaan ke antargat he
 That is, she is near
 jataka kii pacchuppannavatthu main iske kuch ansh prastaavna rup main aate hai
 The stories of the Jataka include the stories of his past births contained within the second diagnosis of Buddha biography in the past
 aitihaasik buddha ke jivan kii kisi ghatana kaa ullekh kar in duure nidaan kii kathaon ke kehane ke liye avkaash nikaal liya gaya he
 Whatever it is actually creates the native
 prayek jataka ke paanch angon ke uparyukt vivechan se spasht he ki jataka gadhy-padya mishrit rachanaayen hai
 The saga part is considered to be the oldest part of the native
 tripitak ke antarbhoot is gaatha bhaag ko hi maananaa adhik upyukt hoga
 The rest is fiction
 parantu jataka-kathaon kii prakruti aisi he ki mul ko vyakhya se alag kar dene par kuch bhi samaj main nahin aa saktaa
 Only the stories do not create the story
 unke upar jab vartmaan or ateet kii ghatnaon ko dhaanchaa chadhaaya jaataa he tabhi kathavstu kaa nirmaan hota he
 Therefore, it is necessary to have the above five elements in the whole Jataka, in which all except the saga-part is its explanation, the latter is added
 phir bhi suvidha ke liye or aitihaasik drushti se galat dhang par ham uskon jataka kah dete hai
 In fact, the collection of 547 Jataka tales which are coordinated with the above mentioned five organs, we should not say Jatakattvavana or Jatakathakatha, rather than Jataka
 phosbal or kowal ne jiskaa kramshah roman lipi main or angreji main sampaadan or anuwaad kiya he yaa hindi main bhadant anand kausalyayan ne ‘jataka’ sheershak se 6 bhaagon main anuvaa da kiya he, vah vastav main jataka na hokar jataka kii vyakhya he
 The Jataka tales are basically only gathas, the rest is its interpretation
 gaatha or jataka ke shesh bhaag kaa kalkram aadi kii drushti se kya parsparik sambandh he yah prashn saamne aata he
 In the legend, the story has been called Abhinambabuddha saga or stories sung by Lord Buddha
 ve buddhavachan hai
 Therefore, she was a part of Tipitak and compiled from there, a structure of stories has been presented on her
 sampoorn jataka granth kii vishaywastu kaa jis aadhaar par vargeekaran hua he, usase bhi yahi spasht he ki gaatha-bhaag, yaa jise pinternitj aadi vidwaanon ne gaatha-jataka kaha he, vahiin uskaa muladhar he
 The classification of the Jataka text is based on the number of gathas and not on the basis of subject matter
 ther-theri gaathaon ke samaan vah bhi nipaton main vibhakt he
 The native has 22 falls
 pehle nipaat main 150 aisi kathaayen he jinamein ek kii ek gaatha pai jaati he
 There are 150 Jataka stories in the second fall, but two stories are found in each story
 isi prakaar tisare or chauthe nipaat main pachaas-pachaas kathaayen he or gaathaon kii sankhya kramshah teen-teen or chaar-chaar he
 Further, the same sequence often continues till the thirteenth fall
 chaudaaven nipaat kaa naam pakinnak nipaat he
 The number of gathas in this fall is varied from 14 to not according to the rules
 isliye iskaa naam pakinnak rakh diya gaya he
 10 stories are also found in some stories in this nipati and up to 47 in some stories
 aage ke nipaton main gaathaon kii sankhya nirantar badhati gai he
 The title of the fifteenth ninth is Vis Nispat, Tis Nispat of the sixteenth, forty-nine Nishat of the seventeenth, Panas Nishat of the eighteenth, Sixty Nishat of the nineteenth, Sattinipat of the twentieth and Assinipatam of the twenty-seventh
 bisen nipaat main keval das jataka kathaayen he kintu prayek main gaathaon kii sankhya sau se bhi upar he
 The number of gathas in the last person is above seven hundred
 in sabase yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki jataka kathaon kii aadhaar gaathaayen hi he
 In the interpreting part of many Jataka stories themselves, the distinction between Pali and Atthakatha is shown, as in many other books of Pali Sutras and also in the texts of Visuddhimagga
 jahaan tak jataka ke veyyakaran bhaag se sambandh he, vahaan pali kaa arth tipitak gat gaatha hi ho saktaa he
 From the evidence of language, the saga part is more ancient than the prose section
 pinternitj ne kaha he jataka kii sampoorn gaathaon ko tipitak kaa mul ansh nahin mana ja saktaa he
 There is also a distinction between them
 swayan jataka ke vargeekaran se hi yah spasht he
 In the fourteenth fall, the number of stories of each Jataka tale is not very much 14 as per the rules - somewhere is very high
 isi prakaar biswein nipaat main uski do jataka kathaon kii sankhya sattar-sattar na hokar kramshah 92 or 93 he
 It has been concluded that the original number of the Jatakas or the saga of the Jatakas will be the same as the number of the title of Nipat
 or baad main uskaa sanvardhan kiya gaya he
 So some of the saga is more ancient and some is relatively less ancient
 isi prakaar gadhy bhaag bhi kuch atyant pracheenta ke lakshan liye hue he or kuch apekshaakrit arvachin he
 There is no resemblance between prose and saga part in some people and there is a lot of variation in the style anywhere
 is sabase jataka ke sankalanaatmak rup or uske bhashaaroop kii vividhta par prakaash padataa he jisamen kai rachayitaaon yaa sankalankartaaon or kai shatabdiyon kaa yoga rahaa he
 The antiquity of the Jataka stories is undeniable, most of its prose is also very ancient
 bharhut or sanchi ke stupon kii pashaan veshtoniyon par jo chitra ankit he ve jataka ke gadhy bhaag se hi sambandhit hai
 Therefore, most of the prose part of Jataka which is ancient, in the third, second century BCE must be so popular that it can be made the basis of craftsmanship
 atah saamanytah ham jataka ko buddhakalin bhartiya samaaj or samskruti kaa pratik maan sakate hai
 Some of the signs and stages depicted in it are also from prague-buddhist India and some are from the post-buddha era
 jahaan tak gaathaon kii vyakhya or unke shabdaarth kaa samb ndh he, vah sambhavtah jataka kaa sab se adhik arvachin ansh he
 The author of this excerpt is considered Acharya Buddha Ghosh
 ‘gandhavans’ ke anusaar acharya buddhaghosh ne hi ‘jatakatthannana’ kii rachana kii, kintu yah sandigdh he
 While showing a variation of language style and giving some other prohibitive reasons, Dr
 T
 W
 Royce Davids does not consider Buddhaghosha to be the author or compiler of the Jatakattavavana
 swayan jatakatthakatha ke upodghaat main lekhak ne apana parichay dete hue kaha he ‘‘ xxrep 4 
 shantchitt pandit buddhamitt bhikshu buddhadev ke kehane se xxrep 8 
 vyakhya karunga
 The Mahishasak sect was a Buddhist sect unlike the Mahavihara tradition
 buddhaghosh ne jitani atthakathaayen likhi he, shuddh mahaviharavasi bhikshuon kii upadesh vidhi par aadhaarit hai
 Therefore, it is not right to associate the author of the scripture with Acharya Buddhaghosh
 sambhavtah yah koi anya sinhalai bhikshu the, jinka kaal paanchavin shatabdi isvi mana ja saktaa he
 It contains the following stories: tripitak The Jataka tales relate to the past births of Lord Buddha
 bodhisattva kii charyaaon kaa unamem varnan he
 So, they are all usually didactic
 parantu unka saahitiyik rup bhi nikharaa hua he
 Despite being didactic, he is artistic in its entire sense
 jataka ke aadi main nidaan-katha he, jisame bhagavan buddha ke pehle 24 budhon ke vivaran ke saath-saath bhagwaan gautam buddha kii jeevani letvan vihaar ke daan kii sweekruti tak di gai he
 The summary of some Jataka tales and the form of their subject matter is as follows
 apannak jataka vyapaar ke liye jate hue do banajaaron kii katha he
 One was killed in the hands of the demons, the other being wise, returned safely home with his five hundred companions

 sandhibhed jataka - gidad ne chugali kar singh or bail ko paraspar ladava diya aadi aadi
 Jataka tales form folk-literature
 usamen pashu-pakshiyon aadi kii kathaayen bhi he or manushyon kii bhi he
 The plot of the natives is of various types
 vinternitj ne mukhyatah saat bhaagon main unka vargeekaran kiya he- The styles of description also vary
 vinternitj ne inkaa vargeekaran paanch bhaagon main is prakaar kiya he
 Vanarind Jataka, Villarwat Jataka, Sihachamm Jataka, Sunsumar Jataka, and Sandhibdha Jataka etc
 jataka kathaayen pashu-kathaayen he
 These stories are very important
 visheshtah inhen kathaon kaa gaman videshon main hua he
 The cast of satire is also seen here in its poetic form
 praayah pashuon kii tulana main manushyon ko hin dikhaaya gaya he
 One special thing is that satire has been done on the entire caste and not on any person
 ek bandar kuch dinon ke liye manushyon ke bich aakar rahaa
 Later turns to his teammates
 saathi poochhate he-‘‘manushyon ke samaaj main rahe he
 They know their behavior
 hamen bhi kahen
 We want to hear that
 ‘‘ manushyon kii kerani mujhase mat pucho
 Say, we want to listen
 bandar ne kahana shuru kiya,‘‘ hiranya meraa! sona meraa! yahi raat din ve chillaate he
 Two people live in the house
 ek ko munch nahin hoti
 He has long hair, is loose and has holes in his ears
 use bahut dhan se kharida jaataa he
 He hurts all the people
 ‘‘ bandar kah hi rahaa tha ki uske saathiyon ne kaan band kar liye‘‘ mat kahen mat kahen‘‘
 Many pictures of this kind of melodious and unique satire will be found in the native
 visheshtah manushya ke ahankaar ke mithyaapan ke sambandh main marmasparshi vyangy
 In Mahapingal Jataka, in relation to the popularity of Brahmins, in Sigal Jataka, in relation to a very intelligent ascetic, Avariya is in Jataka
 sabbadath naamak shringaal sambandhi hasya or vinod bhi bada madhur he or isi prakaar makkhi hataane ke praytn main daasi kaa moosal se apni mata ko maar dena or bandaron kaa paudhon kaa ukhaad kar pani dena bhi madhur vinod se bhare hue hai
 Similarly, Mahammagga Jataka as adventure, Chdant Jataka etc
 in the form of dramatic narrative, Kunal Jataka etc
 as a compilation of statements saying on the same subject, Ummadanti Jataka in the form of brief drama, etc
 Etc
, Pesantara Jataka as the whole epic, and Sankich Jataka as the historical dialogues and Mahanardakasap Jataka etc
 anek prakaar ke varnanaatmak aakhyaan jataka main bhare pade hai, jinaki saahitiyik visheshtaon kaa ullekh yahan atyant sankshipt rup main bhi nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In Jataka, we get all the material of society, religion, politics, geography, temporal belief, economic and commercial condition and most of life in Buddha India
 jataka keval lok-kathaon kaa pracheenatam sangrah bhar nahin hai
 Its place in Buddhist literature is well accepted
 sthaviravaad ke samaan mahayan main bhi uski prabhoot mahatta he, yadhyapi uske rup ke sambandh main kuch thodaa bahut parivartan he
 Like Buddhist literature, the Jataka has an important place in the overall Indian literature and not only that, in the whole world literature
 isi prakaar bhartiya sabhyataa ke ek yug kaa hi vah nidarshak nahin he, balki uske prasar kii ek adbhoot gaatha bhi jataka main samaaye hue hai
 In particular, no other book can take the place of the native in Indian history
 buddhakalin bharat ke saamaajik aarthik, rajnatik jivan ko jaanane ke liye jataka ek uttam saadhan hai
 Since his information is only relevant, he is more authentic and important
 jataka ke aadhaar par yahan buddhakalin bharat kaa sankshiptatam vivaran bhi nahin diya ja saktaa
 In the Jataka story of Jataka, we find important information related to the geography of the then Indian

 The boundaries of Madhya Pradesh are mentioned there in this way, "in the east of the central country there is a town called Kajangala, after that there are big shawl forests and then further frontier country
