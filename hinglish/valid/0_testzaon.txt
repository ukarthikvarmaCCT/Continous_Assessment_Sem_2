 International Standard Name Identifier is a method for uniquely identifying the public identities of contributors to media content such as books, TV programmes, and newspaper articles
 Such an identifier consistgits divided into four blocks
 It was developed under the auspices of the International Organization for Standardization as Draft International Standard 27729; the valid standard was published on 15 March 2012
 The ISO technical committee 46, subcommittee 9 is responsible for the development of the standard
 ISNI can be used fo The ISNI allows a single identity to be identified using a unique number
 This unique number can then be linked to any of the numerous other identifiers that are used across the media industries to identify names and other forms of identity
 An example of the use of such a number is the identification of a musical performer who is also a writer both of music and of poems
 Where he or she might currently be identified in many different databases using numerous private and public identification systems, under the ISNI system, he or she would have a single linking ISNI record
 The many different databases could then exchange data about that particular identity without resorting to messy methods such as comparing text strings
 An often quoted example in the English language world is the difficulty faced when identifying ‘john Smith’ in a database
 While there may be many records for ‘john Smith’, it is not always clear which record refers to the specific ‘john Smith’ that is required
 If an author has published under several different names or pseudonyms, each such name will receive its own ISNI
 ISNI can be used by libraries and archives when sharing catalogue information; for more precise searching for information online and in databases, and it can aid the management of rights across national borders and in the digital environment
 ORCID identifiers are reserved blocks of ISNI identifiers, for scholarly researchers
 administered by a separate organization
 Individual researchers can create and claim their own ORCID identifier
 The two organizations coordinate their efforts
 ISNI is governed by an ‘international Agency’, commonly known as the ISNI-IA
 This UK registered, not-for-profit company has been founded by a consortium of organisations consisting of the Confédération Internationale des Sociétés d ́auteurs et Compositeurs, the Conference of European National Librarians, the International Federation of Reproduction Rights Organisations, the International Performers Database Association, the Online Computer Library Center and proquest
 It is managed by directors nominated from these organisations and, in the case of CENL, by representatives of the Bibliothèque nationale de France and the British Library
 ISNI-IA uses an assignment system comprising a user interface, data-schema, disambiguation algorithms, and database that meets the requirements of the ISO standard, while also using existing technology where possible
 The system is based primarily on the Virtual International Authority File service, which has been developed by OCLC for use in the aggregation of library catalogs
 Access to the assignment system and database, and to the numbers that are generated as the output of the process, are controlled by independent bodies known as 'registration agencies'
 These registration agencies deal directly with customers, ensuring that data is provided in appropriate formats and recompensing the ISNI-IA for the cost of maintaining the assignment system
 Registration agencies are appointed by ISNI-IA but will be managed and funded independently

 samaaj ke samvedansheel vyakti or samay ke pravaah se ek anubhuti kshan chunakar un donon ke sarthak sambandh ko khoj nikaalnaa, rakesh kii kahaniyon kii vishay-vastu he
 Mohan Rakesh's diary is considered one of the most beautiful works of this genre in Hindi
 mohan rakesh ko kahani ke baad safalataa natya-lekhan ke kshetra main mili
 The period after Bharatendu and Prasad in Hindi plays is the period of Mohan Rakesh, who re-linked Hindi plays to theater
 hindi natya sahitya main bharatendu or prasad ke baad yadi li se hatakar koi naam ubharta he to mohan rakesh kaa
 However, there are many other names in the middle who have made important strides in the development journey of modern Hindi drama; But the writing of Mohan Rakesh appears on another pole
 isliye hi nahin ki unhone achche naatak likhe, balki isliye bhi ki unhone hindi naatak ko andhere band kamaron se baahar nikaala or use yugon ke romani aindrajalik sammohak se ubarkar ek nae daur ke saath jodakar dikhaaya
 Actually, Mohan Rakesh's plays are not just Hindi plays
 ve hindi main likhe avashya gaye hai, kintu ve samakaleen bhartiya natya pravritiyon ke dyotak hai
 Not only did he give Hindi drama an all-india status for the first time, but his isolated flow of centuries also led to a general stream of world drama

 Two of Mohan Rakesh's plays, a Day of Aashadh and Taking Historical Background in the Flamingo of the Waves, have been called the saga of the contradictions and doubts of modern man
 ek naatak kii prishthbhumi jahaan guptkaal he to doosraa baudhdhakaal ke samay ke upar likhaa gaya he
 In a day of Aashaadh, where Kalidas struggles with the dilemma of choosing one in success and in love, Kalidas puts forth the riddles of the mind of a modern man, while breaking into love, Hindi as the heroine of this drama that will not break love Literature has found an indescribable character

 The spectacular success of Rakesh's plays on theater became a witness to the fact that there is no gap between drama and theater
