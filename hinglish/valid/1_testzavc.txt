apane swaarth kii purti ke liye ve anek prakaar ke hathkande chalaate hai
 Again, a fact or evidence may be appropriate for the resolution of a suit, but in other matters it may be counterproductive and inappropriate
 yah ukti prasiddh hi he ki ‘sikke ke do pahalu hote hai’, yadi ek paksh ujala yaa laabhadaayak he to doosraa paksh kalushit tathaa hanikaarak bhi ho saktaa he
 Therefore, in all circumstances, the eclipse of the fact used to resolve a suit is not always appropriate
 pifer deshkal, avasthaa tathaa paristhitiyon ke kaaran tathyon tathaa satya main bhi parivartan ho jaataa he
 It is visible that many times there is a distinction between truth and reality
 ’ baar baar dohraane yaa prachlan ke kaaran ham kisi baat ko usee rup main satya maan lete he, kintu vaastaviktaa main vah vaisaa hota hi nahin he
 Therefore, it is appropriate to take a decision only keeping the reality in view
 aakaar yaa gurutv ke kaaran hi kisi tathy ko nahin sweekaar kar lenaa chahie
 Many times it is seen that just being big is not enough, it should also have qualities
 atah maatr aakaar kii guruta ke kaaran kisi bhi cheez ko maan lenaa kori buddhi he
 Thus, in this preaching given to the Kalams, it has been taught that the fact or shape or gravity used to resolve the tradition or written or scripted in the scriptures or practiced since ancient times is not accepted by any fact or subject
 Should be taken
 is prakaar bhagwaan buddha ne in vishyon ko paristhitiyon ke anuroop amaanya ghoshit kiya - What are the criteria then that can be accepted? If it is a religion, it is indescribable and if it is accepted, its fruit will be pleasant and beneficial
 nishchay hi maanviya chintan, vaigyanik tathaa vivekwaad ke liye is sutt se behatar kasuti or ho hi kya sakati he? Then Lord Buddha told the Kalams about valid things
 unhone un sabhi vishyon ko atyant vrafambaddh tathaa vyavasthit dhang se kalaamon ke samaksh upasthaapit kiya jo maanya tathaa satya kahe ja sakate hai - Lord Buddha says that any subject can be accepted only when that subject is religious - that is, friendly and efficient in religion
 nishchay hi, yadi samaaj main kisi kaary yaa vishay ke kaaran sabhi kaa kalyaan hota he tathaa dukh se peedit janata ko raahat milti he athwa logon ke jivan main uâti tathaa vikaas kaa maarg khulata he va sabakaa hit hota he, to ye vishay vufashal hi kahe jaayenge
 Therefore, all welfare and human auspicious actions are called vuphshal dharma
 in vufashal karmon ko manyata dena chahie tathaa in vufashal karmon ko karte hue maanavtaa kii seva kerani chahie
 All those subjects which are indescribable and unpredictable, should be considered valid in the society
 yadi kisi vishay main koi dosha nahin he tathaa vah vishay puujarh he, tab aisi paristhiti main use manyata dena hi chahie
 All those subjects and beliefs should be validated, whose eclipse will lead to pleasing and beneficial results
 yadi kisi kaary ko karne se uske parinaam sukhakaari he or samast maanavtaa kaa jisase hit saadhti hota ho, to aise karmon ko karnaa nishchay hi samaaj ke liye laabhadaayak hota he
 It is beneficial to do such welfare subjects
 is prakaar bhagwaan buddha ne kalaamon ke samaksh adhelikhit vishyon kasautiyon ko maanya athwa satya ghoshit kiya
 They are as follows - is prakaar bhagwaan buddha ke ye vaigyanik vachan aadhunik kaal main utane hi praasangik tathaa grahniya he
 These modern science-tested criteria of Lord Buddha can prove to be a guide for modern science
 aadhunik bharat main pali tathaa buddha sahitya kii punah pratishtha karne kaa shrey mukhyatah bhikshutray arthath rahul sankrutyaayan, jagadish kaashyap tathaa bhadant anand kaushalyayan ko jaataa he
 At a time when Buddhism and Pali literature were omitted from India, they edited and translated the texts and published them
 inke jivan-chariton ko dhyanpurvak padhane par gyaat hota he ki ye teenon hi dharmadhurandhar angutar nikaay main vidyaman kesamutti-sutt se atyadhik prabhavit rahen
 This is a kind of manifesto for rationalism and free thinking in the entire matter of the matter, which is given to him while addressing the Kalams
 kalaamon ko diya gaya yah sutt vastav main maanavtaa ke liye ek daay he
 This Kesamuti Sutta greatly influenced these learned monks
 bhagwaan buddha or buddha-darshan ke prati aakarshan hone kii baat ko rahul sanvrifatyayan apni aatmakatha 3 main is tarah se prakat karte hai - In the society and times of two and a half thousand years, i began to taste the rational simple and piercing sentences of the Buddha with fullness
 tripitak main aaye mojizen or chamatkaar apni asambhavta ke liye meri ghrinaa ke paatr nahin, balki manoranjan kii saamagree the
 i used to think, that the impact of twenty five hundred years cannot be on those texts
 asambhav baton main kitni buddha ne vastutah kahin, iskaa nirnay aaj kiya nahin ja saktaa, pifer raakh main chhipe angaaron yaa pattharon se dhanvef ratna kii tarah bich-bich main aate buddha ke chamatkaarik vaakya mere man ko balaat apni ore khinch lete the
 When i heard the Buddha's sermons to the Kalams - 'do not take care of any book, tradition, elderly person, always be sure that you should be mounted on it', then the heart said - Here is a man whose firm belief in truth Is, who understands the importance of free intelligence of man
 jab mainen majjhim-nikaay main padhaa- ‘bede kii bhanti mainen tumhen dharm kaa upadesh kiya he, vah paar utarane ke liye he, sir par dhoye-dhoye phirane ke liye nahin, to maaloom hua, jis chiz ko main itane dinon se dhoondta phir rahaa tha, vah mil gai
 Rahulji should be very impressed with the human welfare related things assigned by Lord Buddha and due to the rendering of rational subjects
 vastutah bhagwaan buddha ke dwaara kahin gai shikshaaon main ek bhi maanav kalyaan tathaa tark ke pare nahin he
 In the Vefasamuti Sutta, the enlightening lines given to the Kalams by the Buddha God descended into Rahulji's heart
 bhadant anand kaushalyayan bhi angutar nikaay kii prastaavna main isi prakaar kii baat ko sweekaar karke is sutt ke prati apni vrufatagyata nivedit karte hai
 He writes that he was attracted to buddhist-dhamma and literature only after reading kesamuti-sutta
 angutar nikaay kii prastaavna main ve is prakaar likhte hai - This new thing by Lord Buddha is somewhere in global history
 kisi bhi dharmaguru ne itnaa bada saahas nahin kiya
 All seem to be trying to establish their own godliness or save it
 kintu bhagwaan buddha kii baat hi niraali he
 They also present the teaching of not blindly following what they said - bhavarth - ‘he pandit! jis tarah ucch taap se pakakar koi suvarna parkhaa jaataa he, usee tarah mere bhi vachanon ko parakhkar grahan karnaa chahie, na ki mere prati gaurav ke kaaran
 ' uparyukt shloke ke madhyam se bhagwaan buddha apane prati shraddhabhaav ko pare rakhkar vigyaan kii kasuti par kasate hue vishay ko grahan karne kii prerana dete hai
 In this way, the contribution of this Anguswada body in returning Pali and Buddhism to India should be considered

 a networking hub and pro software
 network interphes card ko har computer main lagaakar ise ek vishesh adress aavantit kiya jaataa he
 Each interface card is connected to the central hub via an Ethernet cable
 is hub main local aria network ke saare data ko praapt or punarnirdeshit kiya jaataa he
 In this way Ethernet creates a collection of data, their sharing as well as a whole system of printers, fax machines and scanners
 ethernet pranali kaa vistaar karne hetu taron kaa bada janjaal failaa hota he

 yahi baat moorchha ke bare main he
 To understand unconsciousness or unconsciousness, it would be appropriate to first know the normal state of consciousness or consciousness
 hosh yaa chetanta vah sthiti he jisamen vyakti ko swayan kaa tathaa vaataavaran kaa puraa gyaan yaa bhaan rahata he or uski jaruraton ke mutabik yah pratikriya karata he
 If this sense is finished or it is reduced and the person does not work according to the needs of the person or the environment, then it can be called unconscious
 isi achetanta ko ham moorchha, behoshee yaa coma aadi naamon se pukaarte hai
 In the lore of common people, unconsciousness is of a certain kind
 maanon koi vyakti murda samaan, ankhen band, bolchaal band, haath-paanv deele, pratikriya viheen ho
 But unconsciousness or unconsciousness can have many different levels and forms
 vaise to yah kaam doctor kaa he phir bhi aam aadmi kuch khaas baton par gaur karke moorchha kii maujuudagi, uski gambheertha or uske kaarnon kaa thoda bahut anumaan laga saktaa he
 First of all, it has to be decided that what is the effect of waking efforts on the patient? By making loud voices, calling names, shaking hands and feet, causing pain somewhere, the reaction of the patient should be seen
 kya vah ankhen kholta he, bolta he, sahi bolta he, dard se apane angon ko bheenchataa he, bachaata he
 Looks or cries towards people
 uske haath pairon kii kya sthiti he ? ve yaa to deele dhaale shithil ho sakate hai yaa mirgee ke samaan sakht va jatke vaale
 Clothes can be found dirty after the patient's control over urine and plumbing ends
 sharir kaa rang yaa to saamaanya ho saktaa he yaa nila yaa safed
 Blue color due to lack of oxygen and white yellow water due to lack of blood or its pressure
 sharir kaa taapmaana yadi thanda ho sadamein kii sambhaavna hogi or yadi tej bukhaar ho to koi infections yaa lu laganaa ho saktaa he
 Some people may feel pulseless
 shwaas kii chaal or gaharaai par bhi gaur kiya jaataa he
 Signs of injury or bleeding should be found
 jahrile padaarth ke seven kii ashanka ke liye aas paas ke sabooton par dhyaan dena padataa he
 Sleep - The most important difference is that a person can be fully awakened by normal sleep
 sharir kaa rang, taapmaana, nadee, shwaas sabhi saamaanya rahete hai
 Hysteria - This state is seen many times
 shaareerik rup se swasth vyakti, kinhin manovaigyanik kaarnon se vibhinn bimariyon ke nakalchi lakshan paidaa kar saktaa he
 Unconsciousness is also one of the forms of this state
 is prakaar kii mimicri jaan-boojh kar nahin kii jaati
 Due to psychological / mind complications such symptoms occur automatically when the associated disease is not present
 doctoro ke liye bhi kai baar histyria vaali moorchha kaa nidaan mushkil sabit hota he
 In this state, either the patient can do strange actions or keep silence for a long time and keep the eyes closed
 isamen khatre yaa chintaa kii koi baat nahin hoti
 Unconsciousness is just a symptom
 simptum he moorchha apane aap main koi ek beemaari nahan he balki anek bimariyon ke pratik rup main prakat ho sakati he
 Whatever the diseases are, our brain or brain is the organ responsible for unconsciousness
 yah dimag yaa mastishk hi to he jisame chalate ham hosho-havaas kaayam rakhte hai, chetan rahete hai
 Brain function can be disturbed due to different reasons
 dimag kii swayan kii bimaariyaan or dimag ke alaava sharir ke anya ang-tantron kii bimaariyaan - donon se moorchha aa sakati he
 Examples of the brain's own illnesses - paralysis or large attack of paralysis that interferes with the supply of blood to a large or very sensitive part of the brain
 brain hemarej yani dimag main khun kii nalee kaa fat janaa dimag main infections - jaise meningitis va encephelitis
 Epileptic seizures
 sir kii chot
 Examples of diseases of other organs that can indirectly cause unconsciousness in the brain are examples of - use of toxic drugs, lack of oxygen - suffocation, closed room, submersion, smoke or poisonous gas
 sharir main dher sara khun bah janaa chot laganaa, blad pressure kam ho janaa
 Heart pump obstruction - Heart spreader
 dil kii chaal main aniyamitata
 heart attack
 diabetes kii bigadi avasthaa
 Failure of liver or liver
 tej bukhaar vaala sannipat
 Whatever the reasons for unconsciousness, certain measures can be taken as first aid
 sabase mahatvapurn he dhairya banaaye rakhana
 If you get scared by seeing a person who is unconscious, then your senses will be like losing your breath
 har moorchha khatarnaak nahin hoti
 Many times its duration is very short and the patient himself becomes conscious
 histyria vaali moorchha bilkul hi khatarnaak nahin hoti
 The unconscious person should be kept in open air if he is found in a suffocating environment
 kisi ang se khun bah rahaa ho to use rokane ke prayaas kiye ja sakate hai
 If the temperature is very high, the body is kept wet with clothes soaked in cold water
 shwaas ke raste main rukaawat dur karnaa mukhya baat he
 The patient's own sputum, phlegm or vomit accumulate in his throat, blocking the way to the windpipe
 galaa saaf karnaa jaruri he
 With the help of a clean, washed cloth
 marij ko karavat se yaa pet ke bal litaakar, uske bistar kaa sirhaana, pairon kii apeksha nichle str par kar dena chaiye
 That is, bricks can be placed under the footed side
 dil va shwaas ruuk jane par kuch jaankaar log dil kii maalish va munh se saans dene kaa praytn kar sakate hai
 It is sometimes useful to try and vomit in the fear of consuming poison, and finally the patient should be rushed to a hospital as soon as possible
 moorchha dikhti mrityu ke samaan he parantu yahi kya kam he ki insaan apane prayatnon se maut ke jabadon se bhi ek baar / anek baar batch jate hai

 Sometimes its color is white, sometimes red, sometimes yellow
 purv ke prayek yugon main sharir dhaaran karte hue iske teen varna ho chuke hai
 This time it is Krishnavarna, so its name will be Krishna
 ' vasudev kaa putr hone ke kaaran uskaa atiratikt naam vasudev bhi rakhaa gaya

 Krishna represents many genres in Indian culture
 unka chithran aamtaur par vishnu jaise krishna, kaale yaa nile rang kii twachaa ke saath kiya jaataa he
 However, ancient and medieval inscriptions, both in India and Southeast Asia, and in stone sculptures have depicted them in the natural color from which it was made
 kuch granthon main, unki twachaa ko kavy rup se jambul ke rang ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 Krishna is often depicted wearing peacock-feathers or crowns, and is often depicted playing the flute

 Similarly, the early Tamil texts of the medieval era also include statues of Krishna and Rukmini
 in dishanirdeshon ke anusaar banaai gai kai murtiyon sarkari sangrahalay,chennai ke sangrah main hai
 a detailed account of Krishna as a personality is first written in the epic Mahabharata, which depicts Krishna as an avatar of Vishnu
 mahakavy kii mukhya kahaniyon main se kai krishna kendriya hai shri bhagavat gita kaa nirmaan karne vaale mahakavy ke chathe parv ke atharahave adhyay main yuddh ke maidan main arjuna kii gyaan dete hai

 a central authority sets a limit or cap on the amount of pollutants that can be emitted

 The total amount of rebates and credits cannot exceed the limit, which limits the total emissions to that level
 ve companiyaan jinhen apane utsarjan chhot ko badhaane kii jarurat he, unke liye yah aavashyak he ki ve un logon se credit khariden jo kam pradooshan karte hai

 Thus, in theory, those who can reduce emissions in the cheapest way will do so, achieving a reduction in pollution with minimal impact on society

 Economists have urged the use of "market-based" instruments, such as emissions trading, rather than directive "order and control" regulation to address environmental problems
 Order and control regulation has been criticized for being too rigid, insensitive and ineffective to technological and geographical variations
 haalanki, utsarjan main prabhavi dhang se katautee karne ke liye, utsarjan vyapaar ko ek cap kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or cap ek sarkari niamak tantra he
 After a threshold has been set by a government political process, individual companies are free to choose whether and how much they will reduce their emissions
 utsarjan ko kam karne main vifaltaa ko aksar ek anya sarkari viniamak tantra dwaara dandit kiya jaataa he, ek jurmaana jo utpaadan kii laagat ko badha detaa he
 Companies will choose the lowest cost way to follow pollution regulation, which will induce reductions where there are the least expensive solutions, while allowing emissions that are more expensive to reduce
 aage chalakar "cap-and-trade" kahe jane vaale is vaayu pradooshan niyantran drushtikon kii prabhavakaarita ko sookshm-aarthik computer chhadam adhyayan kii shrinkhalaa main pradarshit kiya gaya

 Each reduction strategy is then matched to a "minimum cost solution" created by a computer optimization program to identify a combination of minimum cost source reductions to achieve the given subtraction goal
 prayek maamle main yah paaya gaya ki nunatam laagat samaadhaan naatakeey rup se, katautee kii kisi bhi paaramparik ranneeti se falit pradooshan kii samaan maatra main kami se sasta tha
 This led to the concept of "cap and trade" as a measure of achieving a "minimum cost solution" for a given level of deduction
 itihaas ke kram main utsarjan vyapaar ke vikaas ko chaar charnon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: The textbook emissions trading program can be called a "cap and trade" approach in which a composite cap is established on all sources and then these sources are allowed to trade among themselves to determine which ones Sources actually increase the total pollution load
 mahatvapurn antaron vaala ek vaikalpik drushtikon ek aadhaar-rekha or credit kaarykram he
 In a baseline and credit program pollutants that are not under an overall cap, credit can be created by pushing their emissions below a baseline level of emissions, usually called offsets
 is tarah ke credit ko pradooshkon dwaara kharida ja saktaa he jinke paas ek niamak seemaa he
 It is possible that a country reduces emissions using an order and control approach, such as regulation, direct and indirect taxes
 The cost of this approach differs in different countries because the marginal abatement cost curve - the cost of eliminating an additional unit of pollution - varies by countries
 It may take China $ 2 to eliminate one ton of CO2, while Sweden or the US might take more than that
 antarrashtriya utsarjan vyapaar bazaar, bhinn macs kaa laabh uthaane ke liye nirmit kiye gaye
 Trade emissions through gains from trade can be more beneficial to both seller and buyer, as compared to a simple emission capping scheme
 do europea deshon par vichaar kiijie, jaise sweden or germany
 donon desh chahen to utsarjan kii puri aavashyak maatra ko swayan kam kar sakate hai yaa phir ve ise bazaar main kharidne yaa bechney kaa chunaav kar sakate hai
 For this example we assume that Germany can cut its CO2 at a much lower cost than Sweden, for example, MACS> MACG where Sweden's MAC curve is much darker than Germany and the total amount of rreq emissions Which needs to be reduced by one country
 graph ke bain ore germany ke liye MAC vakr he
 rreq is the amount of reductions required for Germany, but the MACG curve on rreq does not intersect with the market discount price of CO2
 Thus, based on the market price of CO2 rebates, Germany is likely to benefit more if He cuts emissions more than necessary
 dayee taraf sweden ke liye MAC vakr he
 rreq is the required amount of deduction for Sweden, but the macs curve intersects the market price of the CO2 rebate before reaching rreq
 is prakaar, CO2 kii bazaar chhot keemat ko dekhte hue, sweden ke paas laagat bachat kii kshamta he agar vah utsarjan main, aatanrik rup se aavashyak katautee se kam katautee karata he or balki unhen kahin or katautee karata he
 In this example, Sweden would cut emissions until its MACS intersects with P, but this would be only a fraction of Sweden's total required reductions
 uske baad vah germany se p mulya par utsarjan credit kharid saktaa he
 Sweden's own internal cost of deductions, combined with the price of credit purchased from Germany in the market, reaches the total reduction required by Sweden
 is prakaar sweden, bazaar main credit kharid kar bachat kar saktaa he
 This refers to "gains from trade", the amount of additional spending that Sweden would have otherwise incurred if it had reduced its total required emissions without trading on its own
 germany ne apane atirikt utsarjan katautee par laabh kamaaya, jitani aavashyaktaa thi usase upar par: usne, jitna usase apekshit tha, us saare utsarjan main katautee karke niyamon ko puraa kiya
 In addition, Germany sold its surplus to Sweden as a credit and received a payment of p per unit deducted, while spending less than P
 uskaa kul rajasav, graph kaa kshetrafal he, uski kul katautee laagat kshetrafal he or isliye utsarjan credit bechney se uskaa shuddh laabh he kshetrafal arthath gains from trade Two r * denotes efficient allocation arising from trade
 agar cmand control paridrishy main utsarjan kii vishisht maatra kii katautee kii kul laagat x he, to germany or sweden main sanyukt pradooshan kii samaan maatra kii katautee karne main, kul katati laagat utsarjan vyapaar paridrishy main kam hogi arthath 
 The above example not only applies at the national level: it also applies to two companies located in different countries, or to two subsidiaries within the same company
 pradooshak kii prakruti us vakt ek bahut mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he jab niti nirmaataa is baat kaa nirnay lete hai ki pradooshan ko niyantrit karne ke liye koun sa dhaancha istemaal kiya janaa chahie
 CO2 acts globally, thus its impact on the environment is the same wherever it is released on Earth
 paryaavarniya drushti se, utsarjan kii utpatti ke sthaan se vastav main koi fark nahin padataa
 The policy framework should be different for regional pollutants, as the effects of these pollutants may not be the same in all places
 samaan maatra kaa ek kshetreey pradooshak, kuch sthanon main bahut ucch prabhaav daal saktaa he or anya sthanon main kam prabhaav, isliye yah vastav main myne rakhata he ki pradooshak ko kahaan choda ja rahaa he
 This is known as hot spot problem
 ek lagarange dhaanche kaa aam taur par istemaal, ek uddeshy ko praapt karne kii nunatam laagat ko nirdhaarit karne ke liye hota he, is maamle main ek varsh main aavashyak utsarjan main kul kami he
 In some cases, it is possible to use the Lagrange optimization framework to determine the required deductions for each country, so as to minimize the total cost of the cuts
 aise paridrishy main ek, lagarange gunak, pradooshak ke bazaar chhot mulya ko darshata he, jaise europe or america main utsarjan kii maujuuda bazaar chhot keemat
 All countries face the market discount price that is present in the market that day, so that they are able to make individual decisions that minimize their costs, while simultaneously achieving regulatory compliance
 This is another version of the equilateral-theory, which is generally used in economics to select the most economically efficient decision
 utsarjan main katautee hasil karne ke liye mulya banaam maatra yuktiyon kii tulanaatmak khoobiyon par kaaphi puraani bahes chali aa rahi he
 An emission cap and permit trading system is a quantity instrument, as it fixes the overall emission level and allows the price to vary
 bhavishya main maang or aapurti kii sthitiyon main anischitata, pradooshan credit kii ek nishchit sankhya ke saath yugmit hokar, pradooshan credit kii bhavishya kii keemat main anischitata laata he or udyog ko tadnusaar bazaar kii in asthir sthitiyon ke anuroop dhalane ke kharch ko vahan karnaa hoga
 Thus, the burden of a volatile market lies with the industry and not with the controlling agency, which is generally more efficient
 haalanki, asthir bazaar sthitiyon ke tahat, niyantran agency kii cap ko badalane kii kshamta "vijetaon or parajiton" ko chunane kii kshamta main parivartit ho jaaegi or is prakaar bhrashtachar ke liye ek avasar prastut karegi
 In contrast, an emission tax is a price instrument because it fixes the price while the emission level is allowed to change according to economic activity
 ek utsarjan kar kaa ek pramukh dosha yah he ki paryaavarniya parinaam kii guarantee nahin hoti he
 a tax on the one hand will probably remove capital from the industry by suppressing some useful economic activity, but on the contrary, the polluter does not have to hesitate too much against the uncertainty of the future as the tax amount will go along with the profit
 The burden of a volatile market will be borne by the controlling agency rather than the industry itself, which is generally less efficient
 ek phayda yah he ki, ek samaan kar kii dar or ek asthir bazaar main, kar lagane vaali sanstha "vijetaon or aparajiton" ko chunane kii sthiti main nahin hogi or bhrashtachar ke liye avasar kam honge
 Assuming that there is no corruption and assuming that the controlling agency and industry are equally efficient in adapting to volatile market conditions, the best option relies on the sensitivity of emissions reduction costs, as compared to the sensitivity of profit When the level of emission control is different
 chunki companiyon kii anupaalan laagat main ucch anischitata he, kuch logon kaa tark he ki mulya tantra ishtatam pasand he
 The burden of uncertainty, however, cannot be eliminated and in this case it has shifted to the tax agency itself
 kuch vaigyanikon ne carbon dioxide kii vayumandaleey sandratha main ek seemaa kii chetavanee di he, jiske pare atyant taap prabhaav paidaa ho saktaa he, jisase apurnty kshati hone kii kaaphi sambhaavna he
 If this is a conceivable risk then a quantitative instrument may be a better option because the amount of emissions can be prevented with a higher degree of certainty
 baharhaal, yadi yah jokhim maujuud rahata he to yah sach nahin ho saktaa he, lekin ise GHG sankendran ke gyaat str athwa gyaat utsarjan path ke saath joda nahin ja saktaa
 a third option, known as a safety valve, is a hybrid of price and volume instruments
 yah pranali multah ek utsarjan seemaa or permit vyapaar pranali he lekin adhiktam sweekaarya keemat ko simit kiya gaya he
 Polluters have the option of either obtaining a permit from the market or buying from the government at a specified trigger price
 This system is sometimes recommended as a way of overcoming the fundamental drawbacks of both systems, giving the government the flexibility to adjust this system when new information comes to light
 yah darshaya ja saktaa he ki trigar keemat ko paryaapt ooncha rakhkar yaa permit kii sankhya ko paryaapt neeche rakhkar, suraksha valve ko shuddh maatraatmak yaa shuddh mulya tantra kii nakal karne ke liye upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 All three methods are used as a policy instrument to control greenhouse gas emissions: the EU-ETS is a quantitative scheme that uses a cap and trade system to achieve the goals set by the National Allocation Plans; Denmark has a price system that uses a carbon tax, while China uses the CO2 market price to finance its clean development mechanism projects, but imposes a safety valve of the lowest price per ton of CO2

 Leakage rate is defined as the increase in CO2 emissions from domestic mitigation actions outside countries, in part from the emission reductions of domestic mitigation actions
 tadnusaar, 100% se adhik ke ek risaav dar kaa matlab hoga ki utsarjan ko kam karne ke liye kii gai gharelu karravaayiyon ke prabhavaswaroop anya deshon main kaaphi had tak utsarjan badha he, arthath, gharelu shaman karrwai ne vastav main vaishvik utsarjan main vruddhi ko prerit kiya he
 Estimates of leakage rates to be processed under the Kyoto Protocol are between 5 and 20% as a result of losses in price competition, but these leakage rates were seen as being very uncertain

 Thus, one of the controversies about carbon mitigation policy is how to "level the playing field" with border adjustments
 For example, a component of the American Clean Energy and Security Act calls for a carbon surcharge on goods imported from countries with no cap-and-trade programs
 yahaan tak ki shulk or vyapaar ke saamaanya samjhaute ke anupaalan ke alaava, is tarah ke seemaa samaayojan, yah anumaan karte hai ki carbon utsarjan ke liye utpaadak desh jimmedaari vahan karen
 a common belief among developing countries is that the discussion of climate change in trade negotiations may inspire "green protectionism" by high-income countries
 Consistent with the carbon price of $ 50 ton / CO2, the duty on imports could be significant for developing countries
 vishwa bank ne tippanee kii he ki seemaa shulk shuru karne se, vyapaar upayon kaa prasar ho saktaa he jahaan pratispardhaatmak khel maidan ko asmaan hone ke rup main dekha ja rahaa he

 During the first and second phases, exemptions for emissions were usually given to companies for free, resulting in unexpected gains
 Allerman and Buchner suggested that during the first two years of its operation, the EU ETS converted the expected increase in emissions by 1-2 percent per year to a minor absolute decline
 Grubb and others suggest that a reasonable estimate of emissions reductions during its first two years of operation was 50–100 mtco2 per year, or 2
5–5 percent

 Some rigidity was observed in Phase II, but the use of JI and CDM offsets was allowed, which resulted in the EU not requiring any reductions to achieve the Phase II limit in the absence of the expected emissions
 In comparison, for the second phase it is expected that this limit will result in an emission reduction of 2
4% in 2010
 For the third phase, the European Commission has proposed several changes, such as: newjiland utsarjan vyapaar yojana, ek rashtriya utsarjan vyapaar yojana he, jise newjiland kii paanchavin lebar sarkaar dwaara sitambar 2008 main nirmit kiya gaya or newjiland kii paanchavin rashtriya sarkaar dwaara november 2009 main sanshodhit kiya gaya

 While as a nation, the US did not ratify the protocol, many of its states are now developing cap-and-trade systems and exploring ways to interconnect their emissions trading systems, national and international
 At the level, finding the lowest cost and improving market liquidity
 These states, however, also want to preserve their personal loyalty and unique characteristics

 On 11 December 2008, Rex Tillerson, CEO of ixonmobil, stated that a carbon tax is "a more direct, more transparent and a more effective approach" than a cap-and-trade program, which he said was "certainly unnecessary
" Generates expense and complexity "
 He also said that he hoped that the revenue derived from the carbon tax would be used to reduce other taxes so that it would remain revenue neutral

 yah us protsaahan ko kam kar detaa he jo permit-rini companiyon ko apane utsarjan main katautee kerani hoti he
 On the other hand, issuing too few permits increases the price of the permit too much
 This is an argument in favor of hybrid equipment, which has a price-surface, ie a minimum permit price and a price-limit, ie, a limit on the permit price
 a price range, however, removes the certainty of a particular quantity of emissions
 protsaahan Emissions trading may result in distorted incentives
 udhaaharan ke liye, agar pradooshan failaane vaali companiyon ko, utsarjan permit muft main die jate hai to yah unke liye ek kaaran hoga ki ve apane utsarjan main katautee nahin karenge
 This is because a company with large emissions reductions will potentially be granted fewer emissions permits in the future
 This perverse incentive can be reduced if the permit is auctioned, that is, it is sold to pollutants instead of giving the permit for free

 The outermost membrane is the dura mater, a thick durable membrane that connects both the arachnoid membrane and the skull
 bacteria janit mastishk fever main, bacteria do mukhya margon se mastishk aavaran tak pahunchataa he: rakt pravaah dwaara yaa mastishk aavaran ke saath nesal cavity yaa twachaa ke sidhe sampark dwaara
 In most cases, meningitis attacks the mucous surfaces such as the nasal cavity through the bloodstream through living organisms
 yah aksar virus dwaara hone vaale sankramanon ke baad hota he jo shleshm sataha dwaara pradaan kiye jane vaali baadha ko tod detaa he
 Once bacteria are involved in the bloodstream, the subarachnoid enters the space in places where the blood – brain barrier is weak — such as the choroid plexus
 mastishk fever 25% navjaaton main group bi steptocoki ke kaaran rakt pravaah sankramanon se hota he; yah rup vayaskon main kam aam he
 Direct contamination of the cerebrospinal fluid can arise from indwelling devices, skull fractures or infection of the nasopharynx or from the nasal sinus that forms the passage along the subarachnoid space; Occasionally, congenital defects of the dura mater can also be seen

 When the components of bacterial infected cell membranes are identified by the immune cells of the brain, they react by releasing large amounts of hormone-like cytokine that employ other immune cells and provoke other tissues to participate in the immune response
 
 rakt-mastishk baadha pargamya ho jaati he, jiske kaaran "vaisogenic" cerebraille edima ho jaataa he
 Large amounts of white blood cells enter the CSF, causing inflammation of the brain lining and causing "interstitial" edema
 iske atirikt, rakt keshikaon kii deevaaren apane aap sooj jaati he, jisase rakt kaa pravaah kam ho jaataa he or ek tisare tarah kaa edima "cytotoxic" edima ho jaataa he
 All three types of cerebral edema cause increased intracranial pressure; With which, severe infection also suffers from decreased blood pressure, which means that it becomes difficult for the blood to enter the brain, as a result of which the brain cells lack oxygen and enter the apatosis stage
 manyata yah he ki antibiotics upar bataayi gayi prakriya ko, bacteria sambandhit koshika jhilli utpaadon kii maatra ko badha kar, shuruyaat main or kharaab kar saktaa he
 Specific treatments such as the use of corticosteroids are targeted at discouraging the immune system's response to this type of event
 mastishk fever se peedit kisi vyakti main, rakt pareekshan un chihnon kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye jate hai jo vruddhi or rakt cultureki jaankaree dete hai
 The most important test to identify meningitis is the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture
 halanki lumber panchar tab pratidisht ho jaataa he jab mastishk main koi pind upasthit ho yaa antahkapaly dabaav badha hua ho kyonki iske kaaran mastishk herniation hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 If a person has a nodal or enlarged ICP, a CT or MRI scan is recommended before a lumbar puncture
 yah sabhi vayask maamalon ke 45% maamalon par lagu hota he
 If a CT or MRI is required before LP or if LP proves difficult, professional guidelines suggest antibiotics should be given to delay treatment, especially if it is more than 30 minutes
 aksar CT yaa MRI scan, baad kii avasthaa main kiye jate hai jisase ki mastishk fever kii jatiltaaon kaa aankalan kiya ja sake
 Blood electrolytes may be important in severe forms of meningitis; for example hypnotemia is a common bacterial meningitis due to a combination of several factors including dehydration, improper excretion of antidiuretic hormone, or additional active intravenous fluid administration
 aam taur par ek vyakti ko ek karavat main lita kar, cerebral taral ekatra karne ke liye local anaesthesia laga kar or dural sac main ek sui daal kar lumber panchar kiya jaataa he
 When this is achieved, csf's "opening pressure" is measured using a manometer
