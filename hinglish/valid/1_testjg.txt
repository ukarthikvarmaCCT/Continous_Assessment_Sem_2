 This title was given to Brahmins who settled in Sirohi district of Rajasthan

 Bhamah considered the curvature an ornament
 unke parvarti kuntak ne vakrokti ko ek sampurna siddhant ke rup main viksit kar kavy ke samast angon ko isamen samavisht kar liya
 Therefore Kuntaka is considered the promoter of the Vakrokti sect
 vakrokti siddhant kii pratishtha tathaa pratipaadan kaa shrey kuntak ko he parantu isaki parampara pracheen he
 References to Bhamah's predecessor poets Baan, Subandhu etc
 are found
 bhamah ne vakrokti kaa prayog vyapak arth main kiya he
 He considered the inflection of both the word and the meaning in quibble
 unhone vakrokti tathaa atishyokti kaa samaan arth main prayog kiya he
 Exaggeration means popular transcendence
 vakrokti ko isi kaaran bhamah mul alankaar maanate hai
 Without it, the sentence is no longer a poem, but dialogue remains
 dandi ne bhi vakrokti ko bhamah ke samaan mahatv diya he
 Dandi has given two distinctions of Venmayya - Swabhokti and Vakrokti
 dandi ne vakrokti tathaa atishyokti ko samast alankaaron ke mul main sweekaar kiya he
 The only difference between Bhamah and Dandi is that Bhamah accepts the expression at the periphery of curvature and Dandi considers it to be less important than the curve statement considering it to be different
 anandavardhan ne vakrokti kii swatantra vyakhya nahin kii he
 They have accepted its general and comprehensive form by considering it as a special ornament
 anandavardhan ne bhamah ke vakrokti sambandhi mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue atishyokti tathaa vakrokti ko paryaay mana or sabhi alankaaron ko atishyokti garbhit sweekaar kiya he
 Abhinavagupta has accepted the general form of curvature
 inke anusaar shabd or arth kii vakrata kaa aashay unki lokottar sthiti he tathaa is lokottar kaa arth atishay hi he
 Kuntaka, the originator of Vakrokti theory, called Vakrokti the soul of poetry in his treatise Vakrokti Jeevam
 unhone vakrokti ke antargat sabhi kavy siddhanton kaa samaahaar karte hue samast kavyangon- varna chamatkaar, shabd saundarya, vishaywastu kii romaniyata, aprastut-vidhaan, prabandh kalpana aadi ko uchit sthaan diya he
 According to Kuntaka, quibble is not just speech or utterance miracle, it is poet business or poet skill
 dow nagendra ke anusaar "aadhunik shabdaawalee main ise kalawaad kah sakate hai- kavy kaa sarvapramukh tatv kala he
 This does not mean that Kuntaka has ruled out the subject matter in his theory
 unhone kavy vastu kii swaabhaavik romaniyata ko sweekaar kiya he
 The poet should express the heart-rending religions of the poetic object
 yah kavi pratibha se hi sambhav he
 Thus, according to him, the poet business is ultimately dominant
 " In Indian poetry theory, Rasa theory is based on cognition or emotion and Alankar theory is based on the poet's imagination
 vakrokti siddhant kaa sambandh is drushti se alankaar siddhant se he
 The imagery of figures of speech in quibble has been widely accepted
 yah kalpana kavinishth he, sahrudayanishth nahin
 The difference between sound and quibble is also that the imagery of sound is benign and the imagery of curvature is poetic
 atah dhwani kaa drushtikon vyaktiparak he or vakrokti kaa vastunishth
 Kuntaka has accepted the importance of emotion along with imagination by considering Rasa as the soul of curvature
 kuntak ne ras ko vakrata kaa vishisht ang maan kar bhi angi vakrata ko hi mana he
 The condition of Ras without curvature is not possible whereas curvature without juice has its own independent position
 kuntak ne aisi sthiti ko mahatv nahin dete hue rasvihin vakrata ko tiraskaar yogya mana he
 The quibble theory of Kuntaka is a broad and co-ordinate theory
 isaki udbhaavna ke mul main alankaar siddhant kii parampara ke saath dhwani siddhant he
 The whole poetry has been accepted in Kuntaka's curvature theory

 a major difference is that in contrast to Southeast Asian systems, their cousins do not use clear-cut years to stay in sync with the sidereal year
 iske bajaay, ve rojgaar ke apane sanskaran Metonic chakrahai
 However, since the metonic cycle is not very accurate for the sidereal year, the Southeast Asian calendar flows slowly along the sidereal out of sync, for about one day every 100 years
 So far, a lunar-solar calendar of coordinated structural reforms has been introduced

 The current version of the method of calculation is the Southeast Asian Buddhist calendar based largely on that of the Burmese calendar, which was in use under the names of the various South Asian states of the 19th century under the names Sakarat and Jolak Sakaraj 
 The Burmese calendar was based on the "original" Surya Siddhanta system of ancient India
 ek mahatvapurn antar ke saath system he ki burmi pranali kaa paalan kiya he ek badlaav ke Metonic chakrahai
 It is unclear where, when or how the Metonic system was introduced; The hypothesis ranges from China to Europe
 The Burmese system, and indeed the Southeast Asian system, thus uses a "strange" combination of the sidereal year in conjunction with the Indian calendar to better the tropical year for the Metonic cycle

 In Burmese Buddhist tradition, it was 13 May 544 BC
 But in Thailand, it was dated to 11 March 545 BC, an important date used as the current Thai lunar-solar and solar calendar

 Along with the year 27 lunar sidereal day, the 12 signs of the zodiac, are used for astrological calculations

 Various regional versions of the Chhula Sakarat / Burmese calendar existed throughout various regions of mainland Southeast Asia
 Unlike Cambodia and Burma Systems, the name Kengtung, Lan Na, Lan Xang and Sukhothai Systems, not to mention the number of months
 This means that reading ancient texts and inscriptions in Thailand requires constant vigilance, not only to ensure that it is in the right area to operate correctly, but also to variations within areas only when due to infiltration Practice in variation

 Therefore, the addition of some form of k is required for the lunar year

 An additional eleven days is added every 57 years, and seven additional months are added every 30 years
 It provides 20819 days to complete both calendars
 This will provide a cycle of 57 years, meaning about 365
2456 days in a year and 29
530496 days in a month, if not correct
 is tarah ke rup main, calendar jodta he ek intercalary maheene main chalaang saal or kabhi kabhi bhi ek intercalary din main great lip varsh he
 The intercalary month not only for the correct length of the year but also for the error of correct accumulating half an day to the extent of this month

 The actual Burmese calendar is of the year, 354, 384 or 385 days
 note: Arakanese calendar kehete hai intercalary din main Tagu main nahin, Nayon
 Cambodia, Lao and Thai lunar calendars use intercalary days instead for a different method
 ke bajaay yah ek lip varsh ke rup main burmi pranali, thai pranali sthanon main yah ek alag varsh he
 Thus, the Thai small leap year is 355 days while the Thai great leap year is 384 days

 The date, which currently falls on 17 April, gradually went away over the centuries
 In the 20th century, New Year's Day fell on April 15 or 16th but in the 17th century, it fell on April 9 or 10
 Thailand and Cambodia no longer uses the traditional lunar-solar calendar to mark For New Year's Day
 cambodia or thai system dene ke jaanwaron ke naam karne ke liye varshon se ek chakra ke 12

 Southeast Asian Buddhists use the calendar to keep pace with the lunar month of the solar year, by inserting intercalary months and metonic cycles on days
 However, the Buddhist calendar as defined by the solar year is actually a sidereal year, which is approximately 24 minutes longer than the actual mean tropical year
 isliye, sabhi tarah nakshatra-aadhaarit calendar, chandra-saura calendar kar rahe hai, dhire-dhire dur bahati se mausam
 calendar bahati hai ek din main lagbhag har 60 saal or 4 maheene
 The season against the accumulating drift which used to be New Year's Day fell on 22 March 638 CE, now falls on 17 April 2013 in CE
 There is no known internationally concerted effort to drift off this
 Thailand has moved to the Thai solar calendar under the name of the Gregorian calendar for its "buddhist era"
 In Myanmar, Burmese calendarists have tried to deal with this issue by periodically modifying the intercalation schedule in the Metonic cycle
 ek pramukh ke nakaaratmak paksh yah drushtikon he ki yah sambhav nahin he prakashit karne ke liye bhavishya ke calendar kii tulana main adhik ek kuch varshon aage
 CE was introduced in the Buddhist era to Southeast Asia as well as in the early centuries of Buddhism
 It was not a separate calendar, but simply a year numbering system that employed the organization and methods of calculation of the prevailing lunar-solar calendar in use throughout the region
 In the early centuries CE, the context of the Buddhist calendar prevalent in Southeast Asia was called the Saka era, which has been adopted by Sri Ksetra in 80 CE in the Pew State of the Civil Calendar
 The Saka era was, gradually replaced by the Burmese era or Culāsakaraj, first in Myanmar in 640 CE, and other Theravada states of Southeast Asia between the 13th and 16th centuries
 The Theravada Buddhist tradition also recognizes the eras that are recorded in the life of Buddha since the events of the former Buddhist Anjana Sakaraj

 In Arabic, the word cera or cerat comes from the verb sara, meaning to travel or to travel
 ek vyakti kii sira vah vyakti he jo jivan, yaa jeevani, unke janm, ghatnaon, shishtachar or visheshtaon, or unki mrityu main ghatnaon ke madhyam se yatra karti he
 In modern usage it may also refer to a person's resume
 ise kabhi-kabhi "sira", "seerah" yaa "sirat" ke rup main likhaa jaataa he, jiskaa arth he "jivan" yaa "yatra"
 In Islamic literature, the plural form may also refer to the jackal, the rules of war and dealing with non-muslims
 vaakyansh sirat rasul elaha, yaa al-sira al-naabavia, mohammad ke jivan ke adhyayan ko sanderbhit karata he
 The term Syrah was first associated with a biography of Muhammad by Ibn Shihab al-zuhri, and later became popular with Ibn Hisham's work
 islamic itihaas kii pehali do shatabdiyon main, sira ko aamtaur par magahaaji ke rup main janaa jaataa tha, jise ab keval sira kaa up-samooh mana jaataa he
 Sira's early works include several historical reports, or newspapers, and each report is called Khabar
 kabhi-kabhi shabd parampara yaa haddees kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The Syrah literature includes various asymmetrical materials, mainly consisting of stories of military campaigns carried out by Muhammad and his companions
 ye kahaniyaan aitihaasik khaaton ke rup main lakshith hai or puja ke liye upyog kii jaati hai
 Sira also contains a number of written documents, such as political treaties, military lists, functions of officers, letters to foreign rulers, and so forth
 yah pheravell tirthayatra main unke bhaashan kii tarah mohammad dwaara kiye gaye kuch bhaashanon or upadeshon ko bhi record karata he
 Some Syrah accounts include verses of poetry that commemorate certain events and battles
 jabaki inamen se kuch ko kam gunvattta or pramanikta kii kami mana jaataa he, unamem se sabase gambhir hasan ebn thabeet dwaara hai
 In later periods, certain types of stories included in Sira developed into their own distinct genres
 ek style bhavishyavaaniyon ke chamatkaaron kii kahaniyon se chintit he, jise alam al-nubuva kaha jaataa he 
 Another genre, called the flayal wa mathalib - stories that show the merits and demerits of personal companions, enemies, and other notable contemporaries of Muhammad
 sira ke kuch kaaryon ne mohammad kii kahani ko ek katha ke hisse ke rup main bhi rakhaa jisamen purv bhavishyadvaktaaon, farsi raajaaon, purv islamic arab janajatiyon or rashidun kii kahaniyaan shaamil thim
 Parts of Syrah were inspired, or elaborated, by events described in the Quran
 kuch hisson main ullikhit ghatnaon ke liye prishthbhumi jaankaree pradaan karne ke liye in bhaagon ko aksar tafaseer or esbab al-nuzul ke lekhakon dwaara upyog kiya jaataa tha
 The main difference between a hadith and a historical report is that a hadith is not concerned with such an event, and does not usually specify time or place
 iske bajaay haddees kaa uddeshy ek dharmik siddhant ko islamic kanoon ke aadhikarik strot ke rup main record karnaa he
 Conversely, while a grave may have some legal or religious implications, its main purpose is to convey information about a certain event

 Both include Isanad
 is prakaar 8 veen or 9veen shatabdi se shuru hone se, kai vidwaanon ne donon prakaar ke granthon ke samaan prayaason ko samarpit kiya he
 Also some historians consider Sira and Maghaji literature as a subset of Hadith
 islam kii shuruaati shatabdiyon ke dauraan, siyaara sahitya ko haddees kii tulana main kam gambhirtha se liya gaya tha
 In the Umayyad period, storytellers used to tell stories of Muhammad and earlier prophets in private gatherings and mosques, as they received permission from the authorities
 inamen se kai kahanikar ab agyaat hai
 After the Umayyad period, his reputation deteriorated as he exaggerated and was inclined to imagine and rely on Israelite
 is prakaar unhen masjidon main prachaar karne se pratibandhit kar diya gaya tha
 In later periods, however, Syrah's works became more prominent
 haal hi main, pashchimi aitihaasik aalochana or sira se sambandhit bahes ne kuch muslimon se rakshaatmak ravaiya praapt kiya he jinhone apni saamagree kaa bachaav karne vaale kshamapraarthi sahitya likhaa tha
 For centuries, Muslim scholars have recognized the problem of authenticity of hadith
 is prakaar unhone isnadon kaa moolyankan karne ke parishkrut tareekon viksit kiye hai
 This was done to classify each hadith into "sound" for authentic reports, as opposed to "weak" for the weak ones, among other categories
 chunki kai sira reporton main isnaad kii jaankaree bhi shaamil he or kuch sira compilers swayan jurists or haddees transmeter kaa abhyaas kar rahe the, isliye sira reporton ke liye haddees aalochana ke samaan tareekon ko lagu karnaa sambhav tha
 However, some Sira reports were written using an unfamiliar form of isnad, or what modern historians call the "collective isnad" or "joint report"
 samuhik isnaad kaa upyog yah tha ki ek vyakti ko duusare vyakti ke adhikaar par kisi vyakti ke shabdon ko alag kiye bina ek report sambandhit ho sakati he
 This lack of precision led some Hadith scholars to take any report that used a collective isnad for lack of authenticity
 vim reven ke mutabik, aksar yah dhyaan diya jaataa he ki mohammad kii ek susangat chhavi kaa nirmaan sira ke sahitya se nahin kiya ja saktaa he, jisaki pramanikta or tathyaatmak mulya par kai alag-alag aadhaaron par sawaal uthaaya gaya he
 He lists the following arguments against the authenticity of the tip, following the arguments given here: phir bhi, madina ke samvidhan kii tarah sira kii anya saamagree ko aam taur par pramanik mana jaataa he
 The following is a list of some of the early Hadith collectors who specialized in collecting and compiling the Sira and Maghaji reports: nirdeshaank: 25°36′40′′N 85°08′38′′E / 25

 shribhatta ji ke upasya vrindavipin vilaasi radha or krishna hai
 They are always in love and spread their pastimes in various keys
 bhatta ji kii yah jodi sanathan ,ekares -viharan -parayan ,avichal ,nity -kishor-vayas or sushamaa kaa aagaar he
 In the example presented: radha or krishna sadaa vihaar main leen rahete hai
 But this is not the play of his continual Vihar Kandarp
 vihaar main krida kaa mul prerak tatv prem he na ki kaam
 For this reason, the devotee gets the feeling of sweet juice by the meditation of the continent-vihara
 atah bhatta ji sadaa radha-krishna ke is vihaar ke darshan karnaa chaahate hai or yahi unki upasna he
 They say: yugal kishor kii van-vihaar ,jal-vihaar ,bhojan,hindola,maan,surat aadi sabhi lilaayen samaan rup se anand mulak hai
 Therefore, Bhatt ji has described everything in a simple manner
 yamuna kinare hindola jhulate hue radha-krishna kaa yah varnan bahut sundar he
 In this, along with Jhulan, the corresponding nature is also described as stimulation
 :hindore jhulat piy pyaari
 Similarly, this description of radha-krishna soaking in rain is delightful

 Counting or counting is the act of finding the elements of a finite set of objects
 ginaney kaa paaramparik tarika yah rahaa he ki kisi "ganitr" ko samucchy ke har tatva ke liye ek se lagaataar badhaate rahanaa, kisi na kisi kram main, jabaki tab tak un tattvon ko chinhit karte rahanaa taaki usee tatva se ek se adhik baar bhent na ho, jab tak koi achinhit tatva na bachein; yadi pehle vastu ke baad ganitr ek par sthapit tha, to antim vastu se bhent ke baad jo mulya aata he, vah tattvon kii vaanchit sankhya detaa hai
 Related term calculation refers to uniquely identifying the elements of a finite set or infinite set by assigning a number to each element of the set
 puratathvik sakshya hai jo suzav dete hai ki insaan kam se kam 50,000 varshon se ginati kar rahaa hai
 Counting was primarily used by ancient cultures to keep track of social and economic data such as the number of group members, hunter animals, property, or debt
 ginati ke vikaas ne ganitiya sanketan, sankhyank paddatiyon or lekhan ke vikaas ko janm diya
 Calculations can be done in different types
 gananaa shabdic ho sakati he, arthath har sankhya ko jor se bolnaa taaki pragati kaa trek rakhaa ja sake
 It is often used to count objects that exist, but also to count many things over time
 gananaa milan chinhon ke rup main bhi ho sakati he, jis main prayek sankhya ke liye ek chinh ankit kiya jaataa he or phir milan ke baad sabhi chinhon ko gina jaataa hai
 This proves useful when items have to be counted repeatedly over time, such as how many times something has happened throughout the day

 As soon as we accept that behind normal physical quantities there are quality spaces, which are only special in normal quantities, the quality coordinates at these places and that there is a metric in a space, the following question arises that We can do physics, ie, we can directly develop physics using the notion of physical quality and metric and especially sub Without any special choice of physical quantity without doing yoga? In fact, the independently developed quality spaces of a particular choice of physics, ie the coordinates on, represent the independently measurable physical properties of a particular choice of physical quantities

 Under this, poets have been compiling 700 or more than couplets as a book
 "satsai" shabd "sat" or "sai" se bana he, "sat" kaa arth saat or sai kaa arth "sau" he
 Thus Satsai poetry is poetry which consists of seven hundred verses
 satsai kavy ne ek vishisht parampara ke rup main pratishthit hokar apni nijee visheshtaayen viksit kii hai
 The tradition of Satsai creations began with the Gathasaptashati of "hall"

 After this Govardhanacharya's "aryasaptashati" was written in Sanskrit
 amru kavi ke "amarushtak" main bhi shringarras ke manohari shloke hai
 The impact of these texts increased the fervor of Satsai creations in Hindi literature, but in the premises of Hindi literature, Satsai Rachna continued to develop in its own personal way; He is influenced by his predecessor Satsai literature but is not a lifeless imitation

 In modern times also many Satasaiya were written in the Middle Ages
 aadhunik kaal main bhi satsaiyaan likhi gayi jaise hariudh krit hariudh satsai, viyogi hari kii vir satsai bhi badi prasiddh or samayik rachanaayen hai
 Satsaiyas contain 700 or more than 700 verses
 satsaiyon main pramukh rup se "doha" chand kaa prayog hota he; "doha" ke saath "soratha" or "barbai" chand kaa prayog bhi satsaikaar bich bich main kar dete hai
 Satsayas predominate in Shringaaras
 shringaar ke atirikt niti tathaa bhakthi, vairaygy ko bhi satsaikaron ne liya he
 Bihari Satsai is Shringarpradhan's composition, Brind Satsai is a proverbial poem and Tulsi Satsai has couplets of devotion, knowledge, action and disinterest
 satsaikaron ne apni satsaiyon main praaia: in sabhi vishyon ke dohe kahe hai
 In Shringarpradhan Satsaiya, there is also a couple of policy and couplets of devotion and disinterest with Sringar, as in Bihari Satsai and Matiram Satsai
 brund satsai purnat: nitishatsai he tathaa tulsi satsai main bhakthi taya vairaygy ke dohon ke saath niti ke dohon kii bhi pradhanta he
