 Napoleon Bonaparte took reforms in various areas in 1799 to consolidate his position in power and provide administrative stability to France
 vastutah diarectory ke shashan ko samaapt kar nepalian ne satta kii thi or france kii janata ne us parivartan ko sweekaar kiya tha to iskaa kaaran tha vah araajaktaa or avyavashtha se ub chuki thi
 Therefore, it was necessary for Napoleon to establish a well-organized governance and law and order in the interior
 pratham counsal banane ke baad nepolian ne france ke liye ek naveen samvidhan kaa nirmaan kiya jo kranti yug kaa chauthaa samvidhan tha
 Through this, executive power was vested in three counselors
 pradhan counsal ko anya counsalaron se adhik shakti praapt thi
 In fact, the Republic certainly showed in the Constitution, but the entire power of the state was concentrated in the hands of Nepalis
 nepolian ne shashan vyavastha kaa kenndrikaran kiya or departments tathaa district kii sthaneey sarkaron ko samaapt kar prefect evam sab-prefects kii niyukti kii
 Their appointment and the appointment of all the mayors of villages and cities were directly done by the central government
 is prakaar prashasan ke kshetra nepolian ne in adhikariyon par paryaapt niyantran rakh prashasan ko chust-durust banaae rakhaa saath hi yogyata ke aadhaar par inaki niyukti kii
 Napoleon's reforms in administrative areas were in a way anti-revolution because the National Assembly had completely decentralized the administrative structure during the revolution and elected representatives were given the responsibility to govern the country, but the Nepalese gave this arrangement Reversed and reestablished pre-revolution system
 us drushti se vah kranti kaa hantaa tha
 Napoleon tried to revive France from its dismal economic situation
 is kram main usne sarvapratham kar pranali ko sucharu banaaya
 The task of collecting tax was done by the central employees and the recovery started strictly
 usne ghoosekhori, sattebaaji, thekedaari main anuchit munaafe par roak laga di
 He emphasized austerity and imposed many indirect taxes on the French people
 nepolian ne france main vittiya gatividhiyon ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye bank of france kii sthapana kii jo aaj bhi kaayam he
 It also set up a separate fund to repay the national debt
 nepolian ne jahaan tak sambhav hua sena ke kharch kaa boj vijit pradeshon par daalaa or france kii janata ko is boj se mukt rakhane kii koshish kii
 Napoleon also stressed the improvement of agriculture and planned to make the barren and sandy areas fertile
 vyapaar ke vikaas ke liye nepolian ne avaagaman ke sadhano kii taraf paryaapt dhyaan diya
 Arranged for mechanical education for the progress of various types of businesses, roads, canals built
 francisi audyogic vastuon ko lokapriy banane ke liye pradarshnee ke aayojan ko badhaava diya or swadeshi vastuon evam udyogon ko protsaahan diya
 Encouraged construction work to overcome the problem of unemployment
 is tarah nepolian ne france ko jarjar or diwaaliyepan kii sthit se ubaara
 But even in terms of economic reforms, Napoleon's actions appear to be anti-revolution
 krantikaal main pratyaksh karo par bal diya gaya tha jabaki nepolian ne apratyaksh karon par bal dekar puraatan vyavastha ko sthapit karne kii koshish kii
 In the same way, Napoleon displayed an anti-revolutionary mindset by prioritizing the commercialist philosophy
 uskaa maananaa tha ki rajya ko kosh kii suraksha evam vyapaar main santulan laane ke liye sakriy hastkshep karnaa hoga jabaki kranti kaa bal to mukt vyapaar par tha
 The Nepalese wanted citizens who had faith in him and his system
 iske liye usne shiksha ke rashtriya evam dharmanirpeksh swaroop apanaate hue sudhaar kiye
 Organized education at primary, secondary and higher levels
 sarkaar ke dwaara niyukt shikshakon kii sahaayta se chalane vaale in skulon main ek hi paathyakram, ek hi pathyapustaken ek hi vardi rakhi jaati thi
 Napoleon established a university in Paris and taught subjects in Latin, French, science, mathematics, etc
 yah uniwarsity vishvavidhyalay ke saamaanya arth main koi uniwarsity nahin thi varan praathmik se ucchtar shiksha tak kii sabhi sansthaaon ko ekasutra main baandhne vaali ek vyavastha kii
 Its aim was to keep maximum government control over education and to make students loyal to the government
 nepolian ne shodh kaaryon ke liye insticute of france kii sthapana kii
 Napoleon showed no interest in women's education
 unki shiksha kaa bhaar dharmik sansthaaon par chhod diya gaya
 The majority of France's population was under the influence of the Catholic Church
 kranti ke dauraan carch kii shakti ko kamjor kar use rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya
 Church property was nationalized and clergy were asked to take an oath of loyalty to the state
 isse pope naaraaz hua or aam janata ko virodh karne ke liye uksaaya
 As a result, there was tension between the government and the public
 nepolian ne ise dur karne ke liye 1801 se pope ke saath samjhauta kiya jise konkardet kaha jaataa he
 He had the following provisions
 nepolian kaa sarvaadhik mahatvapurn or sthaayee kaary tha- vidhi samhita kaa nirmaan
 In fact, before the revolution, the law and order of France was different and there were so many types of laws that even those who followed the law did not know them and this chaos increased even during the revolution
 nepolian ne is avyavashtha ko dur kiya
 Napoleon himself considered his Code of Law more powerful than his 40 wars
 is code ke dwaara nepolian ne france main sarvlokik kanoon paddati kii sthapana kii
 Under the Civil Code, he strengthened the authority of the head of the family
 striyaan purushon ke adheen rakhi gai or pati kaa kaary patni kii raksha karnaa he
 The divorce method was made difficult
 civil vivaah kii vyavastha bhi is samhita main kii gai
 Thus, by recognizing the practice of civil marriage and divorce, Napoleon practiced in Europe that the work of society could go on without the cooperation of the priests
 is prakaar anya samhitaayein jaise vyapaar sambandhi kanoon samhita, Code of Criminal Proc
 aadi banaae gaye
 The interests of the laborers were ignored in its trading code and the ban on their unions continued
 is drushti se nepolian ne kranti ke aadarshon ke viruddh kaary kiya
 Despite this, the importance of this law code was to provide uniformity of law throughout the country and to simplify the judicial system practically
 jahaan-jahaan nepolian kii senaayen gai yah samhita lagu kii gai or nepolian ke paraajay ke baad bhi barkaraar rahi
 It is a permanent fame of Napoleon
 nepolian ke vidhi samhita main burjua varg ke hiton par zyada jor diya gaya he
 The officer related to land was further strengthened and the protection of personal property was further strengthened and a number of laws were enacted to protect personal property
 tered union bananaa aparaadh ghoshit kiya gaya
 In case of litigation, the owners were asked to accept the claims of the owners in lieu of the arguments of the workers
 naagarik samhita kaa aadhaar saamaajik samta bhi he
 Privilege and feudal rule had no place in the Code
 bade putr ko sampatti kaa uttaradhikari maanane kaa kanoon bhi nahin tha sampatti par sabhi putron ko barabari kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Napoleon established a new elite in society
 usne aay ke hisaab se oopaadhiyon kaa kram nirdhaarit kiya
 This work of Napoleon was contrary to the ideals of revolution
 europe raajnneetik kshitij par nepolian kaa pradurbhaav ek ghumaketu kii tarah hua or apni prakriya tathaa parishram ke bal par vah sheeghra hi europe kaa bhaagyavidhaataa ban baitha
 In it, everyone was amazed by his amazing military and administrative abilities
 parantu uski shakti kaa stambh jaise baalu kii bhit par khadaa tha
 What collapsed within a few years was virtually the rise and fall of Napoleon like a dazzling meteor
 vah europe ke akaash main sainik safalataa ke bal par chamakta rahaa parantu paraajay ke saath hi uske bhagya kaa sitara dub gaya
 The empire, which was established after hard work, came to an end on seeing that there were many reasons for its downfall, which are the same
 aseem mahatvakanksha- Napoleon was infinitely ambitious
 aseem mahatvakankshi kisi vyakti ke patan kaa mukhya kaaran sabit hoti he
 The same thing happened with Napoleon
 yuddh main jaise- jaise- uski vijay hoti gai vaise- vaise uski mahatvakanksha badhaata gaya or vah vishwa rajya kii sthapana kaa swapan dekhne laga
 He would not have to see the plight of the downfall if he was satisfied with a little and took care of the conquered empire and spent his time in it
 charitrik durbalata- Napoleon was full of courage, restraint and patience, but in his eyes, hatred was his vengeance and his stigma of forgiveness
 uske charitra kii badi durbalata yah thi ki vah sandhi ko sammanit samjhauta nahin maanata tha
 Friendship of any country was no more than a political necessity for him
 dhire- dhire vah ziddee banataa gaya use yah vishwaas tha ki uskaa prayek kadam thik he
 He could never forget, he began to ignore the advice of others
 falat: uske sachche mitra bhi usase dur hote chale gaye
 Napoleon's system was based on militarism- uski raajnneetik pranali sanyavad par aadhaarit thi jo iske patan kaa pradhan kaaran sabit hua
 He depended on the army in all matters, as a result he was always involved in war
 vah yah bhul gaya ki sainikwaad sirf sankat ke samay hi laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 As long as France was clouded by plagues, the people there supported him
 As soon as the plagues were removed, the people stopped supporting him
 francisi janata kii sahanubhuti or prem kaa khona uske liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Apart from this, the defeated nations became his enemies, who rose up against him as soon as the opportunity arose
 itihaaskaar kabbon ne thik hi likhaa he
 'napoleon's empire flourished in war The war was the basis of his existence and it ended in war itself
 ’ Defective military system prarambh main france kii sena desh prem kii bhaavana se otprot thi
 He used to fight for an ideal and to serve a purpose
 parantu jyon- jyon uske samrajya kaa vistaar hua sena kaa rashtriya rup vidhitat hota gaya
 At first, French troops were included in his army but later German German Purtagali and Dutch soldiers were added to it
 falat: uski sena anek rajyon kii sena ban gai
 There was no ideal and purpose before him
 at: uski sainik shakti kamjor padati gai or yah uske patan kaa mahatvapurn kaaran sabit hua
 Weakness of the Navy nepolian ne sthal sena kaa sanghathan thik se kiya tha kintu uske paas shaktishali nausena kaa abhaav tha, jiske kaaran use england se parajeet hona padaa
 If he had a powerful navy he would not have to be defeated by England
 vijit pradeshon main deshbhakti kaa abhaav- The territories he conquered were not in the hearts of the people, but he had goodwill and love for them
 ve nepolian kii shashan se ghrinaa karte the
 When his power began to weaken, his subordinate states began to strive for their independence
 europea raashtra ne uske khilaaf sangh ke liye chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or isi ke chalate waterlu ke yuddh main use parajeet hona padaa
 Enmity with the pope mahadwipiya vyavastha ke kaaran usne pope ko apana shatru bana liya
 When the Pope refused to accept the same continental system, he took over Rome in April 1808
 or 1809 i
 main pope ko bandi bana liya falat: catholicon ko yah vishwaas ho gaya ki nepolian ne keval rajyon kii swatantraaa nasht karne vaala daanav he
 Otherwise, they also destroy their religion
 audyogic kranti- It is said that he was defeated not in the grounds of Waterloo but in the factories of Manchester and the iron cladding of Barkingdhan
 audyogic kranti ke falswarup england main bade -2 kaarkaane khole gaye or dekhte hi dekhte england samrudh ban gaya
 As a result, he was able to meet his army's modern assassin, which proved fatal to Napoleon
 mahadwipiya vyavastha- The continental system was quite forgotten
 vah england ko sabase bada shatru maanata tha
 England's mainstay of power was naval and worldwide trade and Napoleon could not destroy his naval power, so his trade was tried to strike
 isi uddeshy se usne mahadwipiya vyavastha ko janm diya usne aadesh jari kiya ki koi desh england ke saath vyapaar nahin kar saktaa he
 And neither can use England made
 yah nepolian kii bhayankar bhul thi
 This arrangement trapped him in a trap that was difficult to get out of
 isliye mahadwipiya vyavastha iske patan kaa mukhya kaaran mana jaataa he
 War with the Portuguese purtegal kaa england ke saath vyapaarik sambandh tha kintu nepolian ke dawaab ke kaaran use england se sambandh todna padaa
 This caused considerable damage to Purtigal
 isliye usne phir se england ke saath vyapaarik sambandh kaayam kiya
 Napoleon was enraged and attacked Purtagal
 yah bhi nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Conflict with Spain nepolian kii teesri bhul spain ke aantarik maamle main hastkshep tha
 Millions of its soldiers were killed
 falat: is yuddh main uski sthiti bilkul kamjor ho gai
 Which encouraged his opponents, when Napoleon made his brother king of Spain, the inhabitants there were not ready to consider that foreigner as king
 unhone nepolian kii sena ko spain se bhaga diya
 Other countries were also encouraged by that rebellion and they also started revolting, which made its fall inevitable
 rus kaa abhiyaan- Napoleon heavily invaded Russia and Russia did not accept its continental system
 isapar nepolian ne rus par akraman kar diya
 In this, however, Moscow was captured but it had to suffer great damage
 uske virodhiyon ne akraman karne kii yojana banaai
 He had to be defeated in this attack
 thakaan- He was tired of being constantly busy in many wars
 50 tourists have written that all the reason for the fall of Napoleon lies in the same word fatigue
 jyon- jyon vah yudadh main ulajhata gaya tyon- 2 uski shakti kamjor padati gai vah thak gaya or uske chalate bhi uskaa patan jaruri ho gaya
 Relative uske patan ke liye uske sage sambadhi bhi kam uttaradaayi nahin the
 However, he used to behave generously towards his relatives
 lekin jab bhi vah sankat main padataa tha to uske sambandhi uski madad nahin karte the
 Organization of quartz nepolian kii kamajori se laabh uthaakar uske shatruon ne chaturth gut kaa nirmaan kiya or mitra rashtron ne use parajeet kiya
 He was captured and sent to Salbai and was made independent ruler there but Napoleon could not stay there for a long time
 He soon returned to France and became the ruler there
 lekin isbaar vah sirf sau dinon tak ke liye samraat rahe
 The Allies were finally defeated in the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 AD
 vah pakad liya gaya mitra rashtron ne use kaidi ke rup main saint helena naamak tapu par bhej diya jahaan 52 varshon kii aayu main 1821 i
 main uski mrityu ho gai
 Thus, all the above reasons were directly and indirectly responsible for his downfall
 He built his empire through war and it also fell due to the wars
 arthath jin tatwon ne nepolian ke samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha unheen tatwon ne uskaa vinaash bhi kar diya

 vaidyanath mandir, devgarh dwadash jyotirling main ek jyotirling kaa puranakalin mandir he jo bharatvarsh ke rajya jharkhand main atiprasiddh devgarh naamak sthaan par avasthit he
 Being a holy pilgrimage, people also call it Vaidyanath Dham
 jahaan par yah mandir sthit he us sthaan ko "devgarh" arthath devataaon kaa ghar kehete hai
 This place got the name Deoghar due to the location of Baidyanath Jyotirlinga
 yah jyotirling ek siddhapitha he
 It is said that all the wishes of those who come here are fulfilled
 is kaaran is ling ko "kaamana ling" bhi kaha jaataa hai
 The history of the establishment of this linga is that once Rakshasraj Ravana went to the Himalayas to perform austerities for the happiness of Shiva and started cutting his head and offering it to Shivalinga
 ek-ek karke nau sir chadhaane ke baad dasavaan sir bhi kaatane ko hi tha ki shivaji prasann hokar prakat ho gayi
 He turned his head ten times and asked him to ask for a boon
 ravan ne lanka main jaakar us ling ko sthapit karne ke liye use le jane kii ajna maangi
 Shivji gave permission, but with the warning that if he puts it on the road, he will become immovable there
 antatogatva vahi hua
 Ravana walked with Shivalinga, but on coming to a Chitabhoomi on the way, he needed a brief retirement
 ravan us ling ko ek ahir ko thama laghushanka-nivritti karne chalaa gaya
 Here, he felt very heavy from that Ahir and placed it on the ground
 phir kya tha, lautne par ravan puri shakti lagaakar bhi use na ukhaad sakaa or niraash hokar murti par apana angutha gadaakar lanka ko chalaa gaya
 Here the gods of Brahma, Vishnu etc
 came and worshiped that Shivling
 shivaji kaa darshan hote hi sabhi devi devataaon ne shivlinga kii vahiin usee sthaan par pratisthapana kar di or shiv-stuti karte hue waapas swarg ko chale gayi
 According to public opinion and popular belief, this vaidyanath-jyotirlinga is going to give desired results
 devgarh kaa shabdic arth he devi-devataaon kaa nivas sthaan
 The very sacred and grand temple of Baba Bholenath is situated in Deoghar
 har saal sawan ke maheene main sravan mela lagata he jisamen lakhon shraddhalu "bol-bam!" "bol-bam!" kaa jayakaara lagaate hue baba bholenath ke darshan karne aate he
 All these devotees take the holy Ganga water from Sultanganj and take a very hard walk of about hundred kilometers and offer water to Baba
 mandir ke sameep hi ek vishaal talab bhi sthit he
 The main temple of Baba Baidyanath is the oldest, around which many other temples are also built
 baba bholenath kaa mandir maan parvati ji ke mandir se judaa hua he
 The holy journey of Baidyanath Dham begins in the month of Shravan
 sabase pehle tirth yatri sultanganj main ekatra hote hai jahaan ve apane-apane paatro main pavitra gangaajal bharte hai
 After this, they keep Gangajal in their Kanwar and proceed towards Baidyanath Dham and Basukinath
 pavitra jal lekar jate samay is baat kaa dhyaan rakhaa jaataa he ki vah paatr jisamen jal he, vah kahin bhi bhoomi se na sate
 Vasukinath is known for his Shiva temple
 vaidyanath mandir kii yatra tab tak adhuri maani jaati he jab tak vasukinath main darshan nahin kiye jate
 This temple is located near village Jarmundi, 42 km from Deoghar
 yahan par sthaneey kala ke vibhinn roopon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 Its history is related to the Ghatwal of Nonihat
 vasukinath mandir parisar main kai anya chote-chote mandir bhi hai
 There are also three more temples in the main market of Deoghar, west of the Baba Baidyanath temple complex
 inhen baiju mandir ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 These temples were built by the descendants of the chief priest of Baba Baidyanath temple at some time
 prayek mandir main bhagwaan shiv kaa ling sthapit he
 Among the 12 Jyotirlingas of India, Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga is located in Deoghar district of Jharkhand
 vishwa ke sabhi shiv mandiron ke sheersh par trishul laga dikhta he magar vaidyanathdham parisar ke shiv, parvati, lakshmi-narayan va anya sabhi mandiron ke sheersh par panchashul lage hai
 It is said that Ravana used to protect his kingdom Lanka from Panchshul
 chunki vaidyanath jyotirling ko lanka le jane ke liye kailash se ravan hi lekar aayaa tha par vidhaataa ko kuch or hi manjuur tha
 The condition of taking the Jyotirlinga was that there is no place to keep it in the middle, but with Dev Yoga, Ravana became intolerant to the rapid velocity of small-time and started giving Jyotirlinga the form of the changed shepherd of God
 us charvaahe ne jyotirling ko jameen par rakh diya
 In this way Vaidyanathdham was built on the name of the shepherd
 yahan prativarsh mahashivaratri se 2 dinon purv baba mandir, maan parvati va lakshmi-narayan ke mandiron se panchashul utaare jate hai
 During this time, devotees throng to touch the Panchshul
 jaisaa ki neeche ke chitron main aapako dikhaai padegaa
 Panchshulas at the top of other temples located in the Vaidyanathdham complex are taken off a few days before Mahashivratri
 sabhi panchshulon ko neeche laakar mahashivaratri se ek din purv vishesh rup se unki puja kii jaati he or tab sabhi panchshulon ko mandiron par yatha sthaan sthapit kar diya jaataa he
 During this time the alliance of Baba and Parvati temples is removed
 mahashivaratri ke din nayaa gathbandhan kiya jaataa he
 Crowds of devotees throng to get the red sacred cloth of the alliance
 mahashivaratri ke dauraan bahut-se shraddhalu sultanganj se kaanvar main gangaajal bharkar 105 kilometre paidal chalakar or ‘bol bam’ kaa jaighosh karte hue vaidyanathdham pahunchate hai

 utak vigyaan yaa ootiki kii paribhaasha dete hue storer ne likhaa he : utak vigyaan yaa sookshm sharir angon ke bheetar utakon kii sanrachana tathaa unke vinyas ke adhyayan ko kehete hai
 The term histology of English is formed from the Greek words histos and logia, which means the study of tissues
 at: utak vigyaan vah vigyaan he, jiske antargat utakon kii sookshm sanrachana tathaa unki vyavastha athwa vinyas kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The word 'tissue' derives from the French word tissue, meaning structure or texture

 He mentions about b type of tissues in his book

 Since time immemorial, humans have been identifying animals, birds and plants by their shape and size
 vigyaan ke vikaas ke saath vanaspatiyon tathaa jantuon ke sharir ke bheetar kii sanrachana jaanane kii bhi jigyaasa utpann hoti gai
 This curiosity led to the development of surgery
 chikitsa tathaa jeevvaigyanikon ne pashu or vanaspatiyon kii cheerfaad karke unke ang kii sanrachanaon-ang prataangon-kaa adhyayan aarambh kiya
 This study resulted in the creation of the entire body

 Due to the study of optics and cytology, the intractable mysteries of the body got penetrated
 in donon ke sanmilit adhyayan se ootiki-rog-vigyaan kaa vikaas hua
 In 1932, Knoll and Ruska invented the electron microscope, which explained the complex structures of cells and tissues
 isi ke saath saath sharirkriyavigyaan kaa bhi vikaas hota gaya or nae nae rahasyon kaa niraavaran sambhav hua
 Thus, the combined effort of these three sciences has brought unprecedented revolution in the field of biology
 ootiki or koshikavigyaan mukhya rup se sookshm sanrachanaon ke aakaarkiya swaroop ko spasht karte hai
 But since the discovery of aniline pigments, the complex structures of cells have also started to be gained
 aaj sainkadon prakaar ke ranjakon kaa prayog karke sookshm se sookshm sanrachanaon par prakaash daalaa ja rahaa he
 Thus, chemistry has now entered the field of energy

 Knowledge of organisms, cytoplasm and the chemical structures of many organelles in them and cells is now accessible to the general public
 ye angak kis prakaar visheshikrut kaary sampadit karte hai, yah ab agyaat nahin rah gaya
 The study of the chemical nature of microstructures is called ocytochemistry or cytochemistry, and now optics and oxytochemicals are studied together
 hellen dean ke matanusaar is prakaar kii adhyayanvidhiyon kii teen pramukh kotiyaan hai: Bailey's book on the subject of optics emphasizes on histology as well as cell scientific studies
 beli ke matanusaar, chunki utak-vigyaan sanrachana sambandhi adhyayan he or vichchhedan dwaara praapt sharirarachana sambandhi gyaan kii purti karata he, at: iske sharir-kriya-vigyaan tathaa rogavigyaan se ghanishtha sambandh par bhi bal dena aavashyak he
 
 inke matanusaar bhi utak vigyaan kaa aadhaar koshikashareer athwa koshikavigyaan hi he
 From the above description it appears that cytology and histology should be studied together
 chunki koshikaaye atisookshm sanrachanaayen hoti hai, at: ham utak vigyaan ko sookshmsharir kaa hi paryaay maanakar ootiki kaa adhyayan karenge
 Since tissues are made by cells, we will study the energy through cells
 utakon ke samyak adhyayan ke liye yah aavashyak he ki sookshmdarshak yantra tak unhen laane ke purv unako vishesh paddatiyon dwaara upachaar kiya jaae
 To make a microscopic study of the tissue, it is mandatory that it be ultra-thin
 jivit utak ke vibhinn bhaagon main bahut samantaayein pai jaati hai
 Therefore, it is not possible to study it properly
 in kathinaaiyon ko dur karne ke liye sarvapratham utak ko 4 se 8 micron tak vichchhedit kar liya jaataa he
 The 'microtome' device is used for this task
 jivit utak kaa itnaa sookshm viched tab tak sambhav nahin hota, jab tak vah kadaa na ho
 Hence, to harden the tissue, it is stabilized in a solution of special types of chemicals
 sthayeekaran ke uparaant is utak ko alkohalon ke vibhinn gholon, abhiranjakon tathaa anya rasayanon main upachaar karke nirjal kar liya jaataa he
 In the end, it is pre-melted and put at a special temperature
 kuch samay baad mom ke saath hi utak ke tukdon ko chaturbhujakar saanche main daal diya jaataa he
 When the wax hardens, its smaller pieces are cut
 ant main in tukdon ko microtome ke vishesh bhaag main jamaakar usamen ek ati dhardaar chaaku se vishesh motaai ke anek section kaat liye jate hai
 These sections are kept on glass strips and kept for study
 kaanch kii pattiyon ko heating plate par rakhkar unka mom galaa liya jaataa he or utak kaa section kaanch kii pattee par jam jaataa he
 Glass strips laden with these sections are sterilized in special chemicals and alcohol solutions
 phir ise dylin yaa cedar ud aayal main bhigo diya jaataa he
 Now this section is ready for micro-study
 in sectionon ke sookshm adhyayan ke liye bhanti-bhanti ke microscopon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Nowadays, this type of microscope is being used extensively for studying tissues
 is sookshm adhyayan ke liye ootikirasayan or vikiran swachitran vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jane laga he
 Under chemotherapy, the chemical composition of various parts of tissues is studied
 vikiran swachitran vidhi main jivit jatu ke vishesh utak main vishesh prakaar ke radioisotopon kaa pravesh karaayaa jaataa he
 In this way, the untreated tissues are removed from the animal body and made into sections
 in sectionon ko dark room main le jaakar photography ke vishesh rasayanon dwaara anulepit kar lete hai, yaa film ke neeche rakhkar majbootee se band dete hai
 After some time they are taken out of the dark chamber and stabilized
 tatpashchaat inhen prakaash main laakar inkaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Tissues are studied to gain knowledge of their microstructure
 at: utki kii sanrachana kaa sankshipt ullekh aavashyak he

 yah sajaateey yaa samaangi padaarth hota he jo taral athwa gelatin jaisi sthit main rahata he
 This epithelium remains under the cells and small veins
 isamen mucopolisackerids amla paae jate hai
 The half-moon is both soft and firm
 utakon main taral padaarth bhi hote hai, jinamein rakt or lasika mukhya hai
 They flow through both channels or channels
 utak taral koshikaon ko tar rakhata he
 Due to non-metal, the form of the body remains

 The Maharana's army forced the Mughal army to retreat and the Mughal army started fleeing
 deever kaa yuddh In the history of Rajasthan, the war of Diwar is considered to be an important war in 1582, because in this war the lost kingdoms of Rana Pratap were recovered, after this a long struggle between Rana Pratap and the Mughals took place as a war, due to which Colonel James Todd called this war the "marathon of Mewar"
 safalataa or avsaan 
 From 1579 to 1585 revolts were started in the Mughal occupied territories of the former Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Bihar and Gujarat and Maharana was also winning strongholds one after the other, so as a result Akbar was averse to suppress that rebellion and from the Mewar Mughals
 Pressure decreased

 Akbar was Maharana Pratap's greatest enemy, but his fight was not the result of personal animosity, although a battle of his principles and values
 ek vah tha jo apane krur samrajya kaa vistaar karnaa chahta tha, jab kii ek taraf ye the jo apni bharat mathrubhumi kii swadhinata ke liye sangharsh kar rahe the
 Akbar was deeply saddened by the death of Maharana Pratap as he admired Maharana Pratap's qualities from the heart and Akbar knew that there is no hero like Maharana on this earth

 Basic education is very important and valuable in the contribution of Mahatma Gandhi to India
 ise wardha yojana, nayi talim, 'buniyadi talim' tathaa 'basic shiksha' ke naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Gandhiji planned a 'new training' on 23 October 1937, which was to be given a nationwide practical form
 unke shaikshik vichaar shikshashastriyon ke tatkaaleen vichaaron se mail nahin khate, isaliye prarambh main unke vichaaron kaa virodh hua
 Gandhiji said that the idea of the new training is his last and best contribution to India
 gandhiji ke jinav-paryant chale satya ke anveshan evam raashtra ke nirmaan hetu sakriy prayogon ke madhyam se lambe samay tak vichaaron ke gahan manthan ke parinamswaroop nayi talim kaa darshan evam prakriya kaa pradurbhaav hua jo keval bharatvarsh hi nahin, apitu sampoorn maanav samaaj ko ek nayi disha dene main sakasham tha
 But unfortunately this best welfare education system could not be used properly even at the national level, due to which till today this country was unable to achieve meaningful and right swaraj as per Gandhiji's dream
 balki iske vipareet aaj to alam yah he ki shaikshanik, saamaajik evam aarthik drushti se bharat punah paashchaatya samrajyavad ke adheen nirantar sarakta chalaa ja rahaa he
 Today, most of India's education system is dependent on the state or capitalists
 adhikansh rajashrith shikshan-sansthaayen sansaadhan evam anushaasan ke abhaav main niskriy hai
 Therefore, are unable to provide quality education
 isi prakaar poojipatiyon par ashrith sabhi shikshan-sansthaaen vyavsaayik rup main sakriy hai, jo garibon kii pahunch se baahar hai
 Only children of rich people can study in them
 bharat kii swadhinata ke 60 se adhik varsh bitne ke pashchaat bhi aise bacchon kii sankhya kaaphi adhik he, jinhone vidhyalay ke dwaar tak nahin dekhe hai
 Those who have the ability to go to school do not receive anything other than the tradition of English education from Lord Macaulay
 kul milakar unamem bhartiya moulik shiksha ko grahan karanevaale shaayad hi koi mili
 It is not that there is a lack of Indian teachers
 parantu isliye ki sabhi abhibhavakon main yah ichhashakti evam saahas nahin he ki apane bacchon ko sarkaron athwa puunjipatiyon dwaara nirdhaarit angreji shiksha ko tyagkar bhartiya shiksha dilaawein
 Till this cowardly mentality of the general public will not be changed, no Indian educational system including new training can flourish in this country
 22–23 oktober, 1937 ko wardha main jo 'akhil bhartiya shaikshik sammelan' yojit hua, uski adhyakshata gandhiji ne kii
 In his inaugural address, Gandhiji highlighted important aspects of his teaching
 uske baad unki 'nai talim' yojana ke anek pahaluon par khuli charchaa hui
 Many scholars including the famous Gandhian educationist Vinoba Bhave, Kaka Kalelkar and Zakir Hussain participated in this discussion
 sammelan ke antim din nimnlikhit prastaav paarit kiye gayi- After these proposals were passed, a committee of experts was formed under the chairmanship of Dr
 Zakir Hussain, who was given the task of preparing practical courses based on these proposals
 in prastaavon ke aadhaar par ek rashtriya shaikshik yojana taiyaar kii gayi jo desh bhar main 'nai talim', 'buniyadi shiksha' yaa 'wardha yojana' ke naam se prasiddh hui
 As a result of the declaration of the Government of India Act of 1935, when the Congress governments in seven provinces of British India formulated a program for national reconstruction, basic education was also a cornerstone in its fourteen pillars
 gandhi ji buniyadi shiksha ko saamaajik parivartan kaa ek saadhan samajhate the
 They considered it to be a major basis of a quiet social revolution
 ve vyakti ke shaareerik, maansik tathaa aadhyatmik pakshon ke punarnirmaan dwaara saamaajik kranti kaa ek pramukh aadhaar maanate the
 They wanted to bring about a social revolution by rebuilding the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of the person
 aatmavishvaas evam aatmanirbharta ko hi unhone manushya ke purna vikaas kaa aadhaar mana
 He considered education as the birthright of every person
 isiliye unhone saat se chaudaa varshavaale varg ke sabhi baalkon evam balikaon ko ni:shulk evam anivaary shiksha dena aavashyak samajha
 After the acceptance of the Basic National Education Scheme at the Haripur session of the Indian National Congress, since 1938, many experiments in basic education started but they were done at different and limited levels
 san 1939 i
 main dwitiya mahayuddh ke chhid jane se ek or kathinaayee upasthit ho gai
 The Congress cabinet had to resign due to political reasons
 unase yah aashaa kii jaati thi ki ve buniyadi shiksha ke vikaas main sahaayak honge
 But as a result of his resignation, experiments were stopped altogether in some provinces and indifference to experimentation began to appear in other provinces
 swatantraprapti ke baad hi buniyadi shiksha ko shiksha kii rashtriya paddati ke rup main gambhirthapurvak sweekaar kiya gaya
 Basic education continued to progress as the number of basic schools continued to grow
 kintu saadhaaran praarambhik or middle skulon kii apeksha basic skulon kii sankhya kii vruddhi kii gati main kami rahi he
 The status of admission to basic schools has not been satisfactory
 lakshya to yah tha ki basic shiksha main 6 se 14 varsh ke vargvaale sabhi ladakon evam ladakiyon ke liye buniyadi shiksha kaa prabandh kiya jaae
 But no significant progress was made in the first two schemes in this education
 is kaal main buniyadi shiksha ke prasar kii pragati utani bhi nahin hui jitani saadhaaran praarambhik shiksha ke prasar kii, yadhyapi saadhaaran praarambhik shiksha kii pragati bhi santoshjanak nahin he
 The condition of teacher teaching is also not satisfactory at all
 bharat main praarambhik shikshakon kii shiksha ke bare main pratham rashtriya vichaargoshtee kii 1960 i
 kii report or haal main adhyaaapak prashikshan ke sambandh main plan projects kii samiti kii 1963 i
 kii report se siddh hota he ki adhyaaapak prashikshan kaarykram main anek trutiyaan hai
 It has not only lacked proper and qualified staff, buildings, equipment and other macro resources but has also been blamed for inadequate curriculum and ineffective method and style of teaching
 buniyadi shiksha kii koi spasht paribhaasha nahin he jisase log saadharantaya sahamat hon
 There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the basic fundamentals and definite goals of basic education
 gandhi ji ne buniyadi shiksha ke siddhanton ko pratipaadit karte samay ek nishchit saamaajik vyavastha kii kalpana kii thi
 He considered productive work as the center of education, but in actual use, the principle of education by productive work has different meanings
 kuch shikshavid, jo gandhi ji ke anuyaayi hone kaa daawa karte hai, vidyalayon main prayog yogya vastuon ke vaastavik utpaadan par jor dete hai
 Some people believe that this means nothing but education through sports law
 buniyadi shiksha main aatmanirbharta kaa prashn or bhi vivadpurn he
 Gandhiji considered self-reliance as the real criteria of education
 aatmanirbharta se unka taatpary yah tha ki basic skool is seemaa tak swaavlambee ho jaaen ki adhyapakon kaa vetan vidyalayon main bacchon dwaara utpaadit vastuon ko bechakar diya ja sake
 Therefore, initially a very large section of the supporters of basic education started to hope that if a proper environment is created for basic education, then the expenditure on it will be expended and the government will pay the remaining expenses so that basic schools can run efficiently
 kintu anubhav se yah anumaan galat siddh hua
 The pires-lakhani Committee appointed by the Ministry of Education, Government of India, studied this problem and stated that no school was more than 41
09 percent self-supporting in 1950–1951 in Bihar, which was considered to be the primary state of basic education
 sewagram kaa basic skool, jo hindustani talimi sangh ke pathpradarshan evam nirikshan main chal rahaa tha, 63 pratishat tak swaavlambee tha
 Isanan had the distinction of getting first place in the list of basic schools in this direction
 san 1949-1950 main bihar pradesh ke 100 basic skool, jinamein 18 senior basic skool bhi the, keval 15 pratishat hi swaavlambee ho sake
 Since then, in general, there is no change in the situation towards goodness
 bharat sarkaar dwaara buniyadi shiksha ke liye pratham panchavarshiya yojana ke ant main jo moolyankan samiti niyukt hui thi vah bhi isi nishkarshan par pahaunchi
 The Government of India did not even mention self-reliance in the booklet titled 'concept of Basic Education'
 yahan tak ki gandhivaad ke aadarshon ke mahan poshak vinoba bhaave kaa bhi ab yah vichaar ho gaya he ki bacchon dwaara utpaadit vastuon ke vikray kaa laabh shiksha par honevaale uchit kharch ke kam karne par prayog na kiya jaae balki vah abhibhavakon ko milanaa chahie jisase ve apane kaam main apane bacchon kii sahaayta se laabh na uthaa sakane ke kaaran hui kshati ko puraa kar saken
 It seems that the government, in principle, accepts that the profits derived from the productive work of children should be spent in their own interest, such as managing school clothes or mid-day meals
 isliye yah nishkarsh to nikaala hi ja saktaa he ki gandhi ji kii kalpana ke anusaar basic skulon main utpaadak vyavsaayon ko aarambh kar dene se buniyadi shiksha kaa kharch badi maatra main kam nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Therefore, if basic education is to be made a universal method of elementary education across the country, then for this, an economically abundant economy is necessary
 buniyadi shiksha ko saarvbhaum banane ke prashn ko yatharth ke str par sochna chahie
 India has pledged to establish a society with socialist ideals
 aise samaaz kii anivaary baton main se ek yah he ki iske sabhi sadsy sushikshit hon taaki ve saamaanya hit ke liye adhik se adhik yogadan kar saken or apane sammilit praytn kaa jo fal ho usase uchit rup se laabh uthaa saken
 Therefore, universal, free and compulsory education should be the first to be managed within the shortest possible time
 samvidhan kii 45 veen dhara ke anusaar 1960 i
 tak 14 varsh kii avasthaavale sabhi bacchon kii ni:shulk evam anivaary shiksha kaa rajya kii ore se prabandh ho janaa chahie tha
 This is a huge problem and great solutions, both human and physical, are needed to solve it
 yah anumaan he ki yadi desh apni rashtriya aay kaa do pratishat keval praarambhik shiksha par kharch kare to aavashyak saadhan itani maatra main praapt kiye ja sakate he ki chad se 14 varshavaale varg ke sabhi bacchon ko shiksha kii suvidhaayen 1980-1981 tak praapt ho jaaen
 Now, if basic education is given to all children, it will take much longer to reach the level of universal education
 buniyadi shiksha ucch koti kii hone ke kaaran adhik mahangi he
 It is clear from the recommendations of the Auxiliary Committee appointed by the National Committee on Basic Education that the development of elementary education as well as basic education, keeping in view the minimum means required to convert an ordinary elementary school into a basic school Seems necessary
 aavashyaktaa is baat kii he ki ek doordarshee yojana banaai jaae jiske anusaar buniyadi shiksha kaa vistaar baraabar hota rahe taaki ant main yah rashtriya str par praarambhik shiksha kii sudhari hui paddati ke rup main viksit ho jaae
 Some things that need to be done are proposed below: paramparaagat siddhanton par hi kaam kar rahe basic skulon ko kam se kam anivaary sharton kii purti karte hue sachche basic skool bananaa chahie
 The schools which have not been fully developed should be given maximum help so that they become ideal basic schools and others should follow them
 buniyadi shiksha ke vistaar ko lagaataar badhaate rahen
 Convert ordinary schools to basic schools and open new basic schools
 adhikansh pradesh basic skulon kii sankhya ko prativarsh kam se kam 5 pratishat to badha ho sakate hai
 While choosing industries for basic schools, it should be kept in mind that the industries should be prosperous in terms of education and adapt to the social environment and condition of children
 kachche maal kii barabaadi ko rokane ke liye basic skulon kii nimna shreniyon main udyog sambandhi kaary us samay tak na karaayaa jaae jab tak bachche itane paripakv na ho jaaen ki ve iskaa prayog laabhpurvak kar saken
 Soil work, elementary gardening or some low-cost hand work can be done in the lower classes
 buniyadi shiksha ke paathyakram main is aadhaar par parivartan karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Some elements of basic education can be easily adopted in all elementary schools, such as health-related activities, social service programs, cultural activities, etc
 aisa vidhyalay, jiske paas paryaapt maatra main bhoomi ho or sinchai kii suvidhaayen paryaapt hon, fal or tarkariyon ke utpaadan kaa kaary kar saktaa he
 It is necessary that the schools in which these activities are started should be properly planned and at the same time, full educational benefit should be taken from them
 uttar buniyadi vidhyalay ko bahuddeshiy ucchtar madhyamik vidhyalay kii ek shakha samajhnaa chahie jahaan us udyog main yogyata praapt karne par bal diya jaae jise ek chaatr basic skool se karata chalaa aayaa he
 In 1957, the Central Advisory Board of Education, on the opinion of the committee appointed by the Union Ministry of Education for detailed study in this matter, insisted that basic basic education should remain a part of the prevailing secondary education system of the country
 basic skool kii shaikshik yojana ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki adhyapakon kii shaikshik prishthbhumi ucch koti kii ho or ve apane kaary main praveen hon
 All the training institutions that prepare teachers for elementary schools should be of basic style
 prayek pradesh ke prayek jile main ek adarsh prashikshan vidhyalay sthapit kiya jaae
 Four to five basic schools should be attached to this training school
 is centre main paryaapt rup se adhyaaapak evam upkaran hon or buniyadi shiksha kaa sampurna kaarykram isi ke dwaara puraa kiya jaae
 It should be an integral part of a multi-disciplinary college of training which has many training institutes to prepare teachers for all levels of education and different branches of the school program
 1938 main buniyadi shiksha kii moulik yojana jakir hossain samiti ne taiyaar kii thi
 In it, it was recommended that a committee of education should be set up in every province whose functions should also include the work of search and organization in basic education
 prayek pradesh main sthapit shiksha kii pradeshy sanstha buniyadi shiksha kii vividh samasyaon kaa adhyayan tathaa anusandhan kaary kare
 The National Council of Educational Research and Training should research problems of national importance
 anusandhan dwaara samavaay paddati ko adhyaaapak ke liye subodh tathaa sugam bana diya jaae
 There are some main problems related to basic education that need immediate attention to solve, such as the problem of teaching multiple classes by the same teacher, the problem of teaching classes in which the number of children is very large, of different industries
 To explore the educational possibilities and develop their method and production capacity by which to check how far weaving The progress of Hindi education is being made according to its objectives so that the teachers and administrators of basic education can benefit from these methods and tools as needed, to pay attention to the problems of training institutions preparing teachers for basic schools so as to make the training program effective
 And to pay attention to the preparation of appropriate literature for the students

 Rakhi or Rakshasutra has the most importance in Rakshabandhan
 raakhi kachche soot jaise sasti vastu se lekar rangeen kalave, reshmi dhaage, tathaa sone yaa chaandi jaisi manhagi vastu tak kii ho sakati he
 Rakhi is usually tied only by brothers, but respect is also tied by Brahmins, Gurus and younger girls in the family
 kabhi-kabhi saarvajanik rup se kisi netaa yaa pratishthit vyakti ko bhi raakhi baandhi jaati he
 Now the tradition of tying rakhi to trees has also started for conservation of nature
 hindustan main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke purush sadsy paraspar bhaichaare ke liye ek duusare ko bhagava rang kii raakhi bandhate hai
 The Karmakandi Pandit or Acharya chants a sloka in Sanskrit while tying Rakshasutra in all the religious rituals of Hinduism, in which the relation of Rakshabandhan is clearly visible to King Bali
 bhavishyapurana ke anusaar indrani dwaara nirmit rakshasutra ko devguru brihaspati ne indra ke haathon baandhte hue nimnlikhit swastivachan kiya - The Hindi sense of this verse is - "I bind you with the same thread that the great powerful Danavendra king Bali was tied
 he rakshe ! tum adig rahanaa " Retired from bathing in the morning, girls and women decorate a plate of worship
 thali main raakhi ke saath roli yaa haldi, chaaval, deepak, mithai or kuch paise bhi hote hai
 Boys and men get ready and sit in worship or any appropriate place to get the vaccine done
 pehle abhisht devtaa kii puja kii jaati he, iske baad roli yaa haldi se bhai kaa tikaa karke chaaval ko tike par lagaaya jaataa he or sir par chhidaka jaataa he, uski aarti utaari jaati he, dahini kalai par raakhi baandhi jaati he or paison se nyochhavar karke unhen garibon main baant diya jaataa he
 In many provinces of India, there is also the practice of placing Bhojali or Bhujriya over the ear of a brother
 bhai bahan ko uphaar yaa dhan detaa he
 Thus food is served only after completing the Rakshabandhan ritual
 prayek parv kii tarah uphaaron or khaane-pine ke vishesh pakwaanon kaa mahatva rakshabandhan main bhi hota he

 purohit tathaa acharya subah-subah yajmaanon ke ghar pahunchakar unhen raakhi bandhate hai or badale main dhan, vastra or bhojan aadi praapt karte hai
 This festival is so widely and deeply ingrained in Indian society that not only its social significance, religion, mythology, history, literature and films are also untouched by it
 nepal ke pahari ilaakon main brahman evam kshetreey samudaay main raksha bandhan guru or bhaaginey ke haath se bandha jaataa he
 But Nepali Indians of Indian origin living in the south border tie rakhi to sister like Indians
 is din bahanen apane bhai ke daayen haath par raakhi baandhakar uske maathe par tilak karti hai or uski deergh aayu kii kaamana karti hai
 In return, the brother promises to protect them
 aisa mana jaataa he ki raakhi ke rangabirange dhaage bhai-bahan ke pyaar ke bandhan ko majboot karte he
 The siblings feed each other sweets and assure them to live together in happiness and sorrow
 yah ek aisa paavan parv he jo bhai-bahan ke pavitra rishte ko puraa aadar or sammaan detaa he
 Besides emotional siblings, many emotional relationships are also tied to this festival which are beyond the boundaries of religion, caste and country
 rakshabandhan kaa parv bharat ke raashtrapati or pradhanmantri ke nivas par bhi manaaya jaataa he
 Where little children go and tie a rakhi to them
 rakshabandhan atmiyata or sneh ke bandhan se rishton ko majbooti pradaan karne kaa parv he
 This is the reason that on this occasion, there is a trend to tie up defense not only to sister and brother but also in other relationships
 guru shishy ko rakshasutra bandhta he to shishy guru ko
 In India, in ancient times, when a graduate left the Gurukul after completing his education, he tied the Rakshatutra to get the blessing of the Acharya while the Acharya tied the Rakshatutra to his student with the wish that he had acquired the knowledge He should use it properly in his future life so that he can protect his knowledge as well as the dignity of Acharya
 Have it isi parampara ke anuroop aaj bhi kisi dharmik vidhi vidhaan se purv purohit yajmaan ko rakshasutra bandhta he or yajmaan purohit ko
 In this way, the two bind each other in their bonds to protect each other's honor
 rakshabandhan parv saamaajik or paariwarik ekbaddhata yaa ekasutrata kaa saanskrithik upaay rahaa he
 After marriage, the sister goes to a strange home

 Two families and clans have a mutual sum
 samaaj ke vibhinn virgon ke bich bhi ekasutrata ke rup main is parv kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Thus the link that has been broken can be reawakened
 rakshabandhan ke avasar par kuch vishesh pakwaan bhi banaaye jate hai jaise ghevar, shakarpaare, namakpaare or ghughni

 Eat it with puri and curd
 halava or kheer bhi is parv ke lokapriy pakwaan hai

 His famous poem "matrubhoomi Vandana" was published in 1905 in which he writes - "he prabhu! mere bangadesh kii dharti, nadiyaan, vaayu, phool - sab paavan hon;he prabhu! mere bangadesh ke, prayek bhai bahan ke ur antajsthal, avichann, avibhakt evam ek hon

 Jhulan-darshan ends on the day of Rakshabandhan
 raakhi kaa tyohaar kab shuru hua yah koi nahin jaanata
 But there is a description in the Bhavishya Purana that when the war started between Devas and Demons, demons started dominating
 bhagwaan indra ghabara kar brihaspati ke paas gayi
 Indrani, Indra's wife, was listening to everyone sitting there
 unhone resham kaa dhaagaa mantron kii shakti se pavitra karke apane pati ke haath par band diya
 Incidentally, it was the day of Shravan Purnima
 logon kaa vishwaas he ki indra is ladaai main isi dhaage kii mantra shakti se hi vijayi hue the
 From the same day on the day of Shravan Purnima, the practice of tying this thread is going on

 In the Skandha Purana, Padmapuran and Srimad Bhagwat, the story of Rakshabandhan is found in the story called Vamnavatar
 katha kuch is prakaar he-danvendra raja bali ne jab 100 yajna purna kar swarg kaa rajya chhinane kaa praytn kiya to indra aadi devataaon ne bhagwaan vishnu se prarthana kii
 Then Lord Vamana took incarnation as a Brahmin and came to seek alms from King Bali
 guru ke manaa karne par bhi bali ne teen pag bhoomi daan kar di
 God measured the entire sky in three steps and sent King Bali to the abyss, measuring the earth
 is prakaar bhagwaan vishnu dwaara bali raja ke abhimaan ko chakanachur kar dene ke kaaran yah tyohaar balev naam se bhi prasiddh he
 It is said that once Bali went into the abyss, Bali sacrificed his devotion to God in front of him day and night
 bhagwaan ke ghar na lautne se pareshaan lakshmi ji ko naarad ji ne ek upaay bataaya
 Following that remedy, Lakshmi went to King Bali and tied her Rakshabandhan and made her her brother and brought her husband Lord Bali with her

 Another famous story is associated with Rakhi
 kehete hai, mewar kii rani karmavati ko bahadurshah dwaara mewar par hamalaa karne kii purv soochna mili
 The queen was unable to fight, so she sent a rakhi to Mughal emperor Humayun and asked for protection

 puruvas ne yuddh ke dauraan haath main bandhi raakhi or apni bahan ko diye hue vachan kaa sammaan karte hue sikandar ko jivan-daan diya
 It is also mentioned in Mahabharata that when Jyestha Pandava Yudhishthira asked Lord Krishna how i can overcome all the troubles, Lord Krishna advised to celebrate Rakhi festival to protect him and his army
 unka kahana tha ki raakhi ke is reshmi dhaage main vah shakti he jisase aap har aapatti se mukti paa sakate hai
