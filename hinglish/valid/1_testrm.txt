 paathon main or pictograms or logograms kaa upyog har bhashaa main maujuud hai
 They do the work of abbreviating words by using words or symbols that appear to be similar to the syllable of a word, such as today or before
 It is also commonly used in other languages

 Examples: d V6 = Dove SEI and French sept "seven" = cassette
 aankik anukramon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa hai, jab ek shabd ke anek shabdaashon ko sthanapann karte hue sampoorn vaakyansh kaa nirmaan ankon kii sahaayta se kiya jaataa hai

 Hence the normal partial sum s k = ∑ n = 1 kn - 1 an { \ displaystyle S_ {k} = \ sum _ {n = 1} ^ {k} ^ {n-1} a_ {n}} also converge on L
 Will happen
 visham aanshik yoga ekadishtatah hrasman he: While even partial sum is typically increasing: kyonki an sankhya n ek saath ekadishtatah hrasman he
 Additionally, since there are an positive s 2 m + 1 - s 2 m = a 2 m + 1 ≥ 0 { \ displaystyle S_ {2m + 1} -S_ {2m} = a_ {2m + 1} \ geq 0}
 atah ham in prabhaavon kii sahaayta se nimna asamanta pradarshit kar sakate hai: Here a1 - a2 is S2m + 1 following the unsymmetrical decreasing sequence, the sequence converges when m is leading to infinity according to a specified convergence theorem
 isi prakaar sam aanshik yoga bhi shunya kii ore agrasar hota he
 Ultimately, both converge at the end value because jahaan l ko seemaant maan kaha jaataa he, tab ekadisht abhisaran prameya ke anusaar prayek m ke liye Is obtained
 iskaa arth yah hua ki prayavarti shrenee kaa aanshik yoga bhi parinaam seemaa ke upar or neeche parivartit hota he
 If there are odd number of terms, then the last term is positive and partial sum is obtained above the resultant limit

 Both situations lead us to the inequality that we have proven in the past

 in tathyon kii jaankaree ke liye kin sadhano kii sahaayta lee jaay, yah us kshetra kii aavashyakaataaon par nirbhar karata he
 The scope and area of the potential deposits under the exploratory work, their average thickness, the potential quantity and value of the mineral, the distribution of the mineable areas under the deposits, the conditions for opening, developing and mining the mine and suitable for the development of the mine Important facts are included in the decision of the law
 gaveshna ke teen mukhya ang hai : taleey gaveshna, vedhan tathaa bhumigat gaveshna
 The miners are mainly divided into three parts: is prakaar ke khanan main dharaatal ke upar jo pahaad aadi hai unako todakar khanij praapt kiye jaat hai, jaise chooney kaa pathar, baaluu kaa pathar, granite, louh ayask aadi
 The main task in this method is to break the stone
 shilaayein kathorta, majbootee tathaa dridhtaa main bhinn hoti hai
 The rocks are soft, there is no difficulty in breaking them
 aisi shilaon ke udhaaharan jipsom, chini mitti, selkhadi aadi hai
 The rocks in which the metals are found are extremely hard, such as granite, diorite, etc
 in shilaon ko visphotak padaarthon dwaara todaa jaataa hai
 The methods of mining were extremely unsuitable in the ancient and medieval ages
 dhire dhire khanan vidhiyon kaa vikaas hua or unamem barood aadi kaa upyog hone laga
 In the past century, a variety of unjustifiable explosive substances such as dynamite, gelignite, nitroglycerin, etc
 have developed
 khanan main visphotak padaarthon kaa upyog karne ke liye pehle shilaon main chhidr banaaya jaataa he tathaa usamen ye visphotak jo kaartoos ke rup main milte hai, rakh die jate hai or vidyutddhara yaa fus lagaakar unamem aag laga di jaati hai
 The stone crumbles with the explosion
 phir inako dhan aadi se todakar or chota kar liya jaataa he, jisase unhen hataane main suvidha ho
 Various types of boreholes like jack hammer are used to make holes in the stones
 ye yantra sampeedit vaayu athwa kisi drav eendhan dwaara sanchalit hote hai
 The depth of holes is 3-4 feet and diameter is from 1-1 / 2 inch to 2 1 / 2 inch
 kabhi kabhi shilaatal par aise bahut se chhidr kar die jate he or sab main visphotak kaartoos bhar die jate hai tathaa vidyut dwaara sabhi ko ek saath hi jala diya jaataa he, isse puure kaa puraa pahaad tut jaataa he
 Examples of this type of surface mining in India are limestone and iron ore etc
 pattharon ke hataane ke liye badi khaanon main rail kii patariyaan bichhaakar thelon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Mechanical spines have also proved very useful in this work
 ye khurpe un pattharon ko uthaakar bade trakon main bhar dete hai
 The cost of this type of mining in India varies from Rs 5 to Rs 9-10 per ton
 taleey khanan main 40-50 foot tak gaharaai ke pathar nikaale jate hai
 The method of extracting ore and minerals by mining from open pits is used in the mining of copper, iron, coal, limestone and other industrial minerals
 kuch anshon tak yah vidhi sone, chaandi, jaste tathaa sise ke khanan main bhi sahaayak siddh hui hai
 In this type of mining, huge excavator and loading of ore or mineral out of the mine is the main
 khudaai ke liye shaktishaalee yantric khurpon kaa prayog hota he
 They fill pieces of stones blown by hoofs into trucks or wagons
 kam duuri ke liye khanan gadiyon, dibbon tathaa trakon se kaam chal jaataa he or adhik duuri ke liye baari trakon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jo laden hue pattharon ko swachaalit dhang se kisi ek sthaan par ikattha kar dete hai
 The topography of the area is mapped before mining as uncovered minerals and then the thickness of deposit and available quantity of mineral are determined by trenches, test pits and drilling
 pani ke nikaas kii dashaon par bhi saavdhaanee se vichaar kiya jaataa he
 At the commencement of the mining operation, the first step is to remove the soil located on the deposits
 kabhi kabhi badi khaanon ko kholane ke liye mitti hataane main 2-3 varsh tak lag jate hai
 Mining work starts from the peak and flat benches are cut one after another until the foothills are reached
 aajkal aadhunik boring yantron ke avishkaar ke falswaroop 25-30 foot tak motaai kii benchen kaatna saral ho gaya hai
 Arrangements are made for the arrival of light trucks and pads on iron tracks above these benches
 saadharantaya bench banane ke liye shilaon main kai chhidr kiye jate he tathaa visphot karne ke liye lachakeeli visphotak topicaon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 One pound of explosive material can break 4 to 15 tons of rocks
 yah maatra shilaon kii dridhtaa par nirbhar karti he
 The system of mining in the form of open mines in India is mainly used on a large scale for limestone etc
 jin khaanon se cement utpaadan ke liye chuunaa pathar nikaala jaataa he, vahaan 2000 ton tak kaa dainik utpaadan asaamaanya nahin samajha jaataa
 This method is also used in iron ore mining in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa etc
 anya ayskon tathaa khanijon ke atirikt is prakaar kii khanan pranali koyale ke liye bhi vahaan prayukt kii ja sakati he jahaan koyale ke staron kii gaharaai adhik na ho
 Thus even if the thickness of the soil level is more than ten times the thickness of the coal level, this type of mining is considered economically appropriate
 kuch pracheen nadiyon main jo avsaad ekatrit hue hai unamem kabhi kabhi bahumoolya dhaatuen bhi nikshipt ho jaati he
 Obtaining metals by breaking these sediments comes under this type of mining
 kabhi bhi ye dhaatuen nadi kii talahati main milti hai or kai baar inamen sone jaisi bahumoolya dhaatuen paryaapt maatra main mil jaati hai
 In some cases these depressions are also covered by other new depressions
 tab unhen hataakar dhaatuon kii prapti kii jaati he
 Under special circumstances these metals have also been observed to be collected in compressed rocks
 prakshalan nikshapon ke khanan main vishesh rup se ise prayukt kiya jaataa he
 These rocks are made of feces and their particles also vary in size
 prakshalan nikshapon ke pramukh upyogi khanij sona, tin, platinum tathaa viral mittiyaan hai
 The percentage of these metals in rocks is very less
 is vidhi main unche dabaav par pani bade veg ke saath nazal se nikalataa he or shila par takaraata he
 As a result of the collision of water, the rock breaks and breaks into microscopic particles
 pani kii dhara ke saath ye kan aage chal dete hai, jahaan pani sloos baxon jinamein baadhak platen lagi rahati hai, pravaahit kiya jaataa he
 Heavy metals accumulate near the baffle plates and the water flows through the metal plates carrying the separated rock
 jalopha khanan vidhi main pramukh aavashyaktaa vishaal maatra main jal kii hoti he
 Water pressure can range from 50 to 600 feet
 khanan kaa mulya bhi kam hota he, kyonki isamen pani se utpann shakti ke atirikt anya kisi shakti kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 In this way, the measured substances are measured in cubic yards
 bade nikshepon ke khanan main yantric sadhano kaa bhi upyog kiya jaataa he tathaa kabhi kabhi is vidhi se 30 foot motaai ke nikshepon tak kaa khanan hota he
 Alluvial mining is not in practice in India; In some areas gold is obtained by filtering sand and washing it
 bihar main swarnarekha nadi ke tat par rahanevaale nivasee isi prakaar sone kii prapti kiya karte he
 Another method of alluvial mining also uses a special type of mechanical boats
 in naukaaon main ghoomanevaali baltiyon kii vyavastha rahati he, jo talahati se baaluu ko kharonchkar naav par laa detii hai
 Along with this sand many abrasive minerals also come, which are separated by the above method
 burma or malaya ke tin kshetron ke prakshapaalan nikshepon ke khanan main yahi vidhi prayukt kii gai he
 The power requirement and cost of money are also considerable in this mining
 ye naukaaye 20 foot kii gaharaai tak kii baaluu kharonch sakati hai
 The buckets used in these range from 1 1 / 2 to 14 cubic feet
 un anek prakaar ke khanijon tathaa ayskon ke utkhanan main bhumigat khanan kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he jinka khuli hui khaanon ke rup main khanan, gaharaai par sthit hone ke kaaran, aarthik drushti se anupyukt athwa asambhav hota he
 Although underground mining also requires huge capital, there is no other option for mining these deposits
 bhumigat nikshep do prakaar ke ho sakate hai : The nature of these two types of deposits is very different, so their methods of mining also vary according to convenience
 khaanon main kaary aarambh hone se pehle purvekshan tathaa gaveshnatmak kaaryon ko saavdhaanee se samaapt kar liya jaataa he
 After this, the development work of the mine starts
 sarvapratham coop banaae jate hai
 They can be up to 10-12 feet in diameter
 yadi nikshepon kii gairai kam hoti he to pravankon kaa hi nirmaan kar liya jaataa he
 If required, underground passages and galleries are also made, the stones through which the well is cut, if they are not strong, then lining of steel, cement etc
 is also required
 bhumigat khanan main kupon kaa bada mahatv he, kyonki karmchaariyon kaa khan main aana janaa, khanit padaarthon kaa baahar aana, vaayu kaa sanchaalan tathaa khan se pani baahar phenkane ke liye panpon kaa sthaapan inhen se sanchalit hota he
 Any mine must have at least two wells
 khanijon tathaa ayskon ko todane main fawde, kudali tathaa sabbal athwa yantron yaa visphotak padaarthon kii sahaayta lee jaati he
 Efforts are made to extract maximum amount of mineral
 kintu isse khan main shilaon kaa santulan bigadane lagata he
 It depends on the flexibility and strength of the rocks to some extent
 khan main shilaon kaa santulan bigadane se bachaane ke liye khan kii deevaaron tathaa chat ko sahare kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 For this, at the level at which work is going on, pillars are left and minerals are extracted from the surroundings
 kintu isamen khanij kii kaaphi maatra kaa hraas hota he
 Therefore, nowadays the effort is made that sand or any other material should be filled in the empty places and the minerals of those columns should also be removed
 yah vidhi adhikansh bhartiya koyala khaanon main prayukt hoti he
 In addition, wood, iron, concrete, stone, brick, etc
 are also used
 khanij padaarth ko khan se upar laane ke liye pinjade ke aakaar kaa jhula, ispaat ke rasse tathaa vinding ingine kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Trolleys are used inside the mines to bring the mineral from one place to another, which mostly runs on iron tracks
 coop se hokar khan ke karmchaaree bhi khan main inhen jhulon se utarate hai
 Stairs are also used in some mines, such as in asbestos mines in Kodarma
 bhumigat khaanon main upyukt prakaash tathaa shuddh vaayu ke avaagaman kaa prabandh atyant aavashyak he
 Most mines now have electric light
 abhrak aadi kii khaanon main mombatiyaan bhi prayukt hoti he
 For the movement of air, the airways should be large and the natural flow of air should not stop
 kuch sthitiyon main iske liye kuch yantric sadhano kii bhi aavashyaktaa hoti he
 These instruments handle pure air in the mine
 khan main coop khodate samay, athwa jalpatal aa jane par, pani kaa prakritik pravaah prarambh ho jaataa he
 This water is taken to a place by making a drain and from there the pump is taken out of the mine
 bhumigat khaanon main durghatnaayen bhi badi bhayaavanee hoti hai
 Fire is a major problem in them
 aag kii durghatnaayen vishakt gaison ke achaanak visphot se, visphotak padaarthon ke madhyam se yaa kisi anya karanvash ho sakati hai
 Fire extinguishing in coal mines is very complex
 jharia kshetra kii kuch khaanon main varshon se aag lagi hui hai, kintu abhi tak unako bujhaayaa nahin ja sakaa he
 Some accidents are caused by the sitting of the mine or by sudden flooding of water
 abhi gat 27 disambar 1975 ko dhanbad se 27 kilometre dur sthit chasanala koyala khan ke 80 foot upar sthit pani ke ek vishaal hauj main aksmaat 8
35 meter chhed ho gaya or pani badi teji ke saath bharne laga
 As a result, all the 372 laborers working inside the mine at that time were trapped inside the mine and could not be removed in any way
 is durghatnaayen se pehle 1973 main jitpur main 40 majdoor mar gaye the
 238 laborers died in the accident at the Purari mine in Hazaribagh
 1958 main chanakuti main ek durghatana hui thi jisamen 176 log mare the
 As a result of the modern development of mining engineering, all kinds of efforts are made to minimize these accidents and all other problems
 durghatana kii sthiti main aaptkaaleen khanan sainya dal, jo purna rup se susajjit rahata he, dhan or jan kii raksha main apurv sahyog detaa he
 Every mining area has centers for this service

 Kashmiri is also spoken in Banhal, Ramban and Bhadarwah in Jammu province
 pradhan upbhasha kishtwar kii "kashtvari" he
 The language of Kashmir is Kashmiri, it is the language currently spoken in Kashmir
 kashmiri bhashaa ke liye vibhinn lipiyon kaa upyog kiya gaya he, jisamen mukhya lipiyaan hai- sharada, devanagari, roman or parasho-arabi he
 The languages spoken in the north and west of Kashmir Valley - Dardadi, Srinya, Kohwar were unlike the Kashmiri language
 yah bhashaa indo-aryan or hindustani-irani bhashaa ke samaan he
 Linguists believe that former Nagas such as Gandharvas, Yakshas and Kinnars etc
, living in the mountains of Kashmir, separated themselves from the original Aryans long ago
 isi tarah kashmiri bhashaa ko arya bhashaa jaisaa banane main bahut samay laga
 In spite of all this the Naga language has developed automatically, the Kashmiri language maintained its distinct vocal style and went through many stages in the 8th-9th century, like other modern Indian languages
 sharada lipi kaa upyog dasvin shatabdi ke aasapaas ,kashmiri bhashaa likhane ke liye kiya gaya tha
 The legendary Kashmiri script is written only in Sarada
 sharada bhashaa likhane kaa tarika swadeshi he, jo mul brahmi se viksit hua tha
 Scholars, rulers and people of all religions like Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist etc
 used to write in Sharda script
 lalada, rupa bhavani, nand rishi or anya bhakthi kavita sharada lipi main hi likhi gai thim or abhi bhi pustkaalay main inhe padhaa ja saktaa hai
 This script is also used by Kashmiri Pandits to produce birth certificates
 varttman main sharada lipi hinduon tak hi simit he lekin kashmiri bhashaa likhane ke liye, musalmaan arabi aksharon kaa upyog karte hai
 Apart from Sharda in the Kashmiri language, Devanagari script, Roman and persian-arabic have also been used
 kashmiri bhashaa main koshur news, khsar bhavani times, vibhuta, miller aadi patr or patrikaayen bhi shaamil hai
 Now the Kashmiri language software has also arrived
 roman lipi kaa kashmiri bhashaa ke liye bhi istemaal kiya gaya he lekin yah lokapriy nahin he jammu or kashmir sarkaar ne bhi, ab persian-arbik lipi, jo ab kashmiri lipi ke naam se jaani jaati he ,ko hi aadhikarik lipi mana he
 This language is widely used in publishing
 kuch log arabi-farsi script main kashmiri likhte hai, jo urdu se bahut alag nahin he
 In Kashmiri, there are many forms of consonants such as a, aa, u, oo etc
 and the consonants are like dantululiye ch, ja, marathi, but they are not kept in general writing
 kashmiri kaa sthaneey naam kaa shur he; par 17veen shatee tak iske liye "bhashaa" yaa "deshbhasha" naam hi prachlit rahaa
 Probably in other states, it has been referred to as the Kashmiri language
 aitihaasik drushti se is naam kaa sabase pehla nirdesh amir khusro kii nuh-sipihn main sindhi, lahori, telugi or mabari aadi ke saath chalata he
 Apparently this direction is the same as that of the Indian languages like Punjabi, Sindhi, Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Hindi and Urdu
 grearsan ne jin tarkon ke aadhaar par kashmiri ke "daarad" hone kii pariklpana kii thi, unhen phir se parakhnaa aavashyak he; kyonki isse bhi kashmiri bhashaa kii gai gutthiyaan sulajh nahin paatin
 In the absence of Ghosh Mahaprana, the dard influence seen has been seen in Sindhi, Pashtu, Punjabi, Dogri as well as in East Bengal and Rajasthani; But in the synthesis of verbs, in addition to the subject, the dard languages do not throw any light on the touch of men, sex and words of karma
 sambhavat: kashmiri bhashaa "daarad" se prabhavit to he, par udbhoot nahin
 Until the 15th century, the Kashmiri language was written only in the Sharda script
 baad main farsi lipi kaa prachlan badhata gaya or ab isi kaa ek anukulit rup sthir ho chukaa he
 The first Kashmiri translation of the Bible from Sirampur was printed in the Sharda script itself, another in the Persian script and some versions also came out in Roman
 devanagari ko apnaane ke prayog bhi hote rahe hai or aajkal yah devanagari main bhi likhi ja rahi he
 There are a total of 46 phonemes in the Kashmiri Soundmala
 swar : a, aa, i, i, u, uu, e, o, a", aa", u", uu", e", o"; Volume vowels: I, -u, -u anuswaar : an Inter-vocal vyanjan : A, b, c, ङ, f, g, h; Ch, Ch, Z, J; t, tha, da, t, tha, da, na; pa, pha, ba, m; Y, R, L, V, SH, S, h i, i, u, uu or e ke rup padaarambh main yi, yi, -vu, vu or ye" ho jate hai
