 The short-sighted symptoms that may be present in any type of hyperthyroidism are eyelid withdrawal, weakness of the extra ocular muscles and retardation of the papilla
 In the hyperthyroid gaze, the eyelids are more upward than normal, a normal condition, where the "white" of the eye begins at the upper border of the pupil of the eye)
 Extra-vision weaknesses may be present with double vision

 There are many reasons for hyperthyroidism
 adhikanshtah, sampoorn granthi thyroid hormone kaa ati-utpaadan karne lagati he
 This is called Graves' disease
 aam taur par kam maamalon main, atirikt hormone srav ke liye ek akeli granthika jimmedaar hoti he, jise "garm" granthika kaha jaataa he
 Thyroiditis can also cause hyperthyroidism
 anek naidanik sthitiyon main kaaryshil thyroid utak dwaara atirikt thyroid hormone kaa utpaadan kiya jane lagata he
 Following are the main reasons for this in humans: anek anya kaarnon se thyroid hormone kaa ucch rakt str ho saktaa he: Measuring levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone () produced by the mucous gland in the blood) is a preliminary test of particularly suspected hyperthyroidism
 ti kaa nimna str par vishisht rup se ingit karata he ki shlashmik granthi ko mastishk dwaara thyroid granthi ke uttejan main katautee karne ke liye rukaawat daali gayi he yaa "nirdeshit" kiya gaya he, jisase rakt main T4 or / yaa T3 ke staron main vruddhi hone lagati he
 Rarely, an inferior TSH indicates primary failure of the mucosa, or temporary blockage of the mucosa due to other disease, and therefore examination of T4 and T3 is still clinically useful
 grevs rog main prati-ti-abhigraahak rog-pratikaarak yaa hashimoto ke thyroditis main prati-thyroid-paroxides jaise vishisht rog-pratikaarakon ko maapne se bhi rog nidaan main yogadan ho saktaa he
 Blood tests confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, indicating a decrease in thyroid stimulation hormone levels and an increase in T4 and T3 levels
 ti mastishk main shlashmik granthi dwaara banaaya gaya ek hormone he, jo thyroid granthi ko bataata he ki kitna hormone bananaa he
 When thyroid hormone is very high, then TSH decreases
 radiodharmee iodine udgrahan pareekshan or thyroid scan donon atigalagranthita ke kaaran kaa charitra-chithran karte hai yaa radiologist or doctoron ko atigalagranthita ke kaaran ke nirdhaaran main sakasham banaate hai
 Empty stomach radioactive iodine injection is used during the levitation test to measure the amount of iodine absorbed by the thyroid gland or injected into the body by mouth
 atigalagranthita se grast vyakti bahut zyada iodine aatmsaat kar lete hai
 Specifically operated thyroid scan images in connection with the levitation test, allowing visual examination of the gland's hyperactivity
 atigalagranthita or thyroditis se aayi is beemaari ke charitra chithran ke liye thyroid cintigraphy ek upyogi pareekshan he
 This test system typically involves two interconnected tests: a iodine levitation test and a scan with a gamma camera
 The levitation test involves taking a single dose of radioactive iodine, specifically iodine-123 or 123I, as the most suitable isotopic of iodine for clinical studies of thyroid disease
 thyroid utak or thyroid cancer aparoopaantaran kii chhaviyaan banane ke liye I-123 lagbhag iodine kaa adarsh samasthanik he
 Typically, a tablet containing sodium iodide is swallowed by mouth, containing small amounts of iodine-123, possibly less than a grain of salt
 aam taur par goli nigalane se pehle do ghante or uske baad ek ghante tak upwas main rahanaa aavashyak he
 They are generally tolerated by these low doses of radioiodine that are otherwise allergic to iodine and cannot tolerate adverse medium containing large doses of iodine used in similar image-forming diagnostic systems)
 The body excretes excess radioiodine that cannot be absorbed into the thyroid gland by the urine
 kuch rogi naidanik radioiodine se halki allergic pratikraya kaa anubhav kar sakate hai or unhen histaminarodhi diya ja saktaa he
 The patient usually regains the level of radioiodine "levitation" 24 hours later, measured with an instrument connected to a metal spindle tied to the throat, measuring radioactivity emission from the thyroid
 is pareekshan main 4 minute lagate hai, tab tak mashin software ke dwaara udgrahan % sanchit hota he
 Typically, a scan is also performed, where images of the anomalous thyroid gland are taken from the gamma camera; The radiologist studies it and after examining the images produces a report mentioning the levitation% and giving his comment
 atigalagranthi ke rogi vishishtatya saamaanya se unche str kaa radioiodine "grahan karte" hai
 The typical range of RAI levitation is from 10–30%
 ti staron ke pareekshan ke alaava, anek doctor adhik vistrut parinaamon ke liye T3, free T3, T4 or / yaa free T4 ke bhi pareekshan karte hai
 Typical adult limits for these hormones are: TSH: 0
45 - 4
50 uiu / ml, T4 free / direct: 0
82 - 1
77 ng / dl; And T3: 71 - 180 ng / dl
 Individuals with hyperthyroidism can easily display these upper limits of T4 and / or T3 several times
 thyroid granthi aalekh main thyroid kaary kii saamaanya shrenee simaaon kii sampurna talika dekhen
 The following are the causes of hyperthyroidism maanav main atigalagranthita ke upachaar ke liye brihad or aam taur par sweekaarya roopaatmakataaon main damanaatmak thyrostetics upachaar kaa praarambhik asthaayee upyog shaamil he or sambhawatah baad main sthaayee shalya chikitsa yaa radio samasthanik chikitsa kaa upyog bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 All the pathways under active thyroid function can be the cause, which can be easily handled with levothyroxine supplementation
 thyrostetics dawaaen thyroid hormone ke utpaadan ko atakati hai, jaise ki karbimajol or methimajol or propylathuresil
 mana jaataa he ki thyrostetics thyroparoxides dwaara thyroglobulin ke iodinikaran ko rokane kaa kaam karata he or is tarah tetra-yodothyronin ke nirmaan ko roktaa he
 Propylthurasil also functions outside the thyroid gland, actively inhibiting the conversion of T3 into T3
 chunki thyroid utak aamtaur par thyroid hormone kaa ek bada sanchay rakhe hote hai, isliye thyrostetics ko prabhavi ho paane main kai saptaah lag jate hai or khuraaq ko praayah maheenon kii avadhi main titrate karne kii jarurat padati he, saath hi niyamit rup se doctoron kii dekhbhaal or parinaamon kii jaanch ke liye rakt pareekshan bhi karte rahanaa padataa he
 Initial treatment often requires a very high dose, but patients may develop symptoms of hyperactivity if a high dose is used continuously
 khuraaq kaa yah anumapank sahi dhang se kar paanaa mushkil he or isiilie kabhi-kabhi "baadha va pratisthaapan" kaa dhang apanaaya jaataa he
 In obstruction and replacement therapy, sufficient amounts of thyrostatics are taken to completely stop thyroid hormones, treating the patient as if he has complete hypothyroidism
 dhakdhaki, kampan or vyagrata jaise atigalagranthita ke aam lakshanon main se anek koshika satahon par beta adrinergik abhigrahakon main vruddhi dwaara bich-bachaav kiye jate hai
 Beta blockers, typically used in the treatment of high blood pressure, are drugs that counterbalance this effect, reduce palpitations associated with palpitations, and decrease tremor and anxiety
 is prakaar, atigalagranthita se peedit marij aksar tatkaal asthaayee raahat praapt kar sakate hai, jab tak ki upar bataaye radioiodine pareekshan se atigalagranthita kaa charitra chithran ho jaataa he or phir tab adhik sthaayee ilaaj shuru ho sakati he
 Note that these drugs do not treat its long-term effects due to hyperthyroidism or non-treatment, but only treat or alleviate the symptoms of the condition
 thyroid hormone ke utpaadan par kuch alpatam prabhaav tathaapi propranolol se bhi aata he -jiskaa atigalagranthita ke upachaar main do bhoomikaayen hoti hai, jo propranolol ke alag samavayavi padaarth dwaara nirdhaarit hota he
 L-propranolol is the cause of beta-inhibition, so it treats symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism such as tremor, palpitations, rash, and heat intolerance
 di-propranolol thyroxin deodinage kaa avrodh karata he, is tarah T3 main T4 ke roopantaran ko avaruddh karke kuch, haalanki alpatam prabhaav pradaan karata he
 Other beta blockers are used only to treat symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism
 america main propranolol or britain main metoprolol kaa istemaal aksar atigalagranthi ke marijon ke ilaaj main vruddhi karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Premature surgery is an option for reduced use of invasive radio isotopic therapy, but is still needed in cases where the thyroid gland is enlarged and causes pressure on the neck, or the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism
 Essentially cancer-related
 surgery kaa prayog vyapak rup se nahin kiya jaataa he, kyonki atigalagranthita ke sabase aam roopon kaa bahut prabhavakaari ilaaj radiodharmee iodine paddati dwaara kiya jaataa he or chunki parathyroid grathiyon ko nikaalane or aavartak laringial tantrika ke kaate jane se niglana mushkil ho jaataa he or kisi badi surgery se yahaan tak ki samanyikrut stavakgolanu sankraman ho saktaa he
 Some Graves' disease patients, however, can tolerate medications for this or that reason, patients who are allergic to iodine, or patients who refuse radioiodine may opt for surgery
 iske alaava, kuch sarjanon kaa maananaa he ki asaamaanya rup se badi granthi vaale, yaa jinaki ankhen kotor se baahar nikali hui hon, aise marijon ke liye radioiodine upachaar asurakshit he; bhay he ki radioiodine 131 kii bahut adhik khuraaq se marij ke lakshan bad ja sakate hai
 In iodine-131 radio isotopic therapy, radioactive iodine-131 is given through the mouth for one time to prevent or completely destroy the function of the hyperactive thyroid gland
 The isotopic use of this radioactive iodine for ablation treatment is more potent than clinical radioiodine, which has a biological half-life of 8–13 hours
 iodine-131, jo bhi beta kanon ko samaapt karata he jo simit kshetra main utakon ke liye kahin adhik nuksaankaree he, kaa lagbhag 8 dinon kaa arddh-jivan hota he
 Patients who are not affected by the first dose are sometimes given additional, larger doses of radio iodine
 is ilaaj main iodine-131 ko thyroid main sakriy koshikaon dwaara uthaa liya jaataa he or unhen nasht kar detaa he, thyroid granthi ko zyaadaatar yaa puri tarah se niskriy bana detaa he
 Since iodine is easily ingested by thyroid cells and even more readily by overactive thyroid cells, sleep destruction occurs locally and does not have widespread side effects of this therapy
 50 varshon se radioiodine anshochhedan kaa prayog ho rahaa he or iskaa upyog nahin karne kii ekmaatr badi vajah hai garbhavastha or stanpan 
 ek baar jab thyroid granthi niskriy bana di jaati he, tab sharir kii thyroid hormone kii maatra kii zarurat ko puraa karne ke liye pratidin munh ke jariye pratisthaapan hormone chikitsa aasaani se di ja sakati he
 However, a skewed study notes that the incidence of cancer was seen after radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism
 atigalagranthita ke liye radioiodine upachaar kaa pramukh laabh yah he ki aushadhi chikitsa kii tulana main isamen safalataa dar bahut adhik he
 Depending on the dose of radioiodine selected and the disease being treated, the success rate of the definitive solution for hyperthyroidism may vary from 75–100%
 grevs rogiyon main radioiodine kaa ek pramukh sambhavit dushprabhav ke rup main jivan bhar ke liye avatu-alpakriyata kaa vikaas he, jiske liye pratidin thyroid hormone ke ilaaj kii zarurat he
 Occasionally, some patients may require more than one radioactive treatment, depending on the type of disease, the size of the thyroid and the initial administered dose given
 anek rogi pehle is baat se dukhi hote hai ki unhen jivan bhar thyroid hormone kii goli leni padegi
 phir bhi, thyroid hormone surakshit, saste or aasaani se nigal lene vaale hote hai; or hormone thyroid ke jaise hote hai tathaa saamanytah thyroid dwaara hi bane hote hai; aam taur par yah chikitsa bahut adhikansh rogiyon ke liye atyant surakshit or bahut hi sahneeya he
 The destruction of thyroid tissue as a result of radioactive iodine treatment, often leads to a moving period of several days to weeks when symptoms of hyperthyroidism may actually worsen after radioactive iodine treatment
 thyroid hormone yukt thyroid koshikaon ke radiodharmee iodine-janit vinaash ke baad rakt main thyroid hormone ke jari hone se aamtaur par aisa hota he
 In some patients, drug treatments such as beta blockers may be useful in this period
 anek rogi shuruuaati kuch saptaah ko bina kisi samasya ke bardaasht karne main samarth hote hai
 Most patients did not experience any difficulty after radioactive iodine treatment, usually given as a small pill

 radioiodine upachaar or surgery aksar atigalagranthita ko thik kar detii hai
 Some veterinarians prefer radio iodine treatment rather than surgery, as it does not carry the risk associated with anesthesia
 haalanki, billiyon ke liye radioiodine upachaar sabhi kshetron main uplabdh nahin he
 The reason for this is that this treatment requires nuclear radioactive expertise and facilities, since animals' urine, sweat, saliva, and feces remain radioactive for several days after radioactive treatment, so they usually have a total of three weeks
 Like an intimate patient, it is necessary to be kept in the hospital and needs its facilities
 Guidelines for radiation levels differ in different states; Some states, such as Massachusetts, are sent home with care instructions after being hospitalized for two days

 Sometimes dogs develop functional carcinoma in the thyroid; Mostly this is a very aggressive tumor that spreads very rapidly and translocates easily or spreads to other tissues and makes the prior diagnosis very weak
 jabaki surgery sambhav he, lekin yah aksar bahut kathin ho jaati he kyonki dhamniyon, grasanalee or shwaasanlee sahit utakon ke aas-paas punj failte jate hai
 It is possible to do this only to reduce the size of the mass, in this way, you will get relief from symptoms and get time for other treatment works
 yadi kisi kute ko saumy kriyaatmak carcinoma he, upachaar or rog kaa nidaan nahin kii he ki billi se alag he
 The only real difference is that dogs are asymptomatic, with the exception of an enlarged thyroid gland appearing as a sphere in the neck

 "naptune" pracheen roman dharm main samudr ke devtaa the, jo sthaan pracheen bharat main "varun" devtaa kaa rahaa he, isliye is grah ko hindi main varun kaha jaataa he
 In Roman religion, Neptune had a trident in his hand, so Varun has an astronomical symbol

 Human hunters began living in the area, the Nile River has been the lifeline of Egypt ever since

 antarrashtriya sambandhon main yatharthwaad, udaarvaad or rachnawad, teen sabase lokapriy siddhant hai
 Theories of international relations can be divided mainly into two theories, "positivist / rationalist" who focuses primarily on state-level analysis
 or uttar-pratyakshvaadi / chintansheel jo antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhant main uttar aupniveshik yug main suraksha, varg, ling aadi ke vistaarit arth ko shaamil karwaanaa chaahate hai

 As such, a state acts as a rational autonomous actor in maintaining its existence, ensuring its own security and in pursuit of its own selfishness with these primary objectives and thereby its sovereignty and existence

 This level of power is determined by the military, economic and political capabilities of the state
 maanav swabhaav yathartwaadeeyon kaa maananaa he, ki rajya swaabhaavik rup se hi aakraamak hote hai atah kshetreey vistaar ko shaktiyon kaa virodh karke hi aseemabaddh kiya gaya he
 Whereas other offensive / defensive realists believe that states are always concerned about the security and continuity of their existence
 rakshaatmak drushtikon ek suraksha duvidha kii taraf le jaataa he, kyonki jahaan ek raashtra khud kii suraksha ko badhaane ke liye hathiyaar banataa he, to vahiin pratidwandvi bhi saath hi saath samanaantar laabh praapt karne kii koshish karata he
 So this process can lead to more instability
 Safety can only be seen as a zero-sum game / zero-accumulation game, where only relative advantage can be found
 nav yatharthwaad yaa sanrachanaatmak yatharthwaad, kenneth waltz dwaara apni pustak antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke siddhant main ise yatharthwaad ke hi unnat vikaas ke rup main prastut kiya tha
 Joseph Grieco has associated neo-realist ideas with more traditional realists
 siddhant kaa yah prakaar kabhi kabhi "aadhunik yatharthwaad" bhi kaha jaataa he
 Waltz's neo-realism states that the effect of structure should be taken as explaining state behavior
 sanrachana ko do roopon main paribhaashit kiya gaya he, pratham-antarrashtriya pranali kaa vyavastha siddhant, jo kii araajaktaa liye hue he or doosraa- ikaayiyon main kshamtaaon kaa vitaran
 Waltz also challenges traditional realism that emphasizes traditional military power rather than the combined capabilities of the state as demonstrative power
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ke udaaravaadi siddhanton kaa agradoot "adarshavaad" tha
 Idealism which saw itself as a criticism of realists
 antarrashtriya sambandhon main, adarshavaad ek vaicharik drushtikon he jo yah maanata he ki ek rajya ko apni videsh niti kaa lakshya nirdhaarit karne ke liye ise apane aantarik raajnneetik darshan main apnaanaa chahie
 For example, an idealist may believe that to alleviate poverty at home, as well as abroad, poverty must be worked together
 wilson kaa adarshavaad udaar antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhanton ke liye ek agradoot ke rup main tha, jo dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke baad "'sanstha nirmaataaon'" ke bich paidaa hua tha
 Liberalism holds that state preferences, rather than state capabilities, are the main determinants of state behavior
 yatharthwaad ke vipareet, jahaan rajya ek ekaatmak abhinayta ke rup main dekha jaataa he, vahin udaarvaad rajya ke kaaryon main bahulata ke liye anumati detaa he
 Thus, priorities will depend on different factors in different states, such as their culture, economic system or type of government
 udaaravaadi yah bhi maanate hai ki rajyon ke bich sampark keval raajnneetik athwa suraksha ke maamalon tak hi simit nahin he, jabaki inamen aarthik athwa saanskrithik maamalon ke liye bhi aapas main sampark hota rahata he, chaahe wo vanijyik companiyon, sanghathanon yaa vyaktiyon ke madhyam se hi ho
 Thus, despite a chaotic international system, many opportunities exist for a broad idea of cooperation and power, such as cultural capital
 ek anya dharna yah bhi he ki purna athwa saapeksh laabh keval sahyog or parsparik - nirbharta ke madhyam se hi praapt kiya ja saktaa he or is tarah se shanti ko hasil kiya ja saktaa he

 Realists reveal a disagreement in this theory of liberals, that they have often opposed state government, citing structural reasons for peace
 sebstian rosato, jo ki loktantric shanti siddhant kaa ek aalochak he, ne loktantric shanti ko chunauti dene ke liye sheet yuddh ke dauraan latin america main vampanthi jhukaav vaale loktantric deshon ke prati america ke vyavhaar ko ingit kiya he
 There is also an argument that economic dependence between trading partners reduces the likelihood of war
 iske vipareet yathartwaadee daawa karte hai ki aarthik nirbharta sangharsh kii sambhaavna kam ko karne kii bajaay badwa detii he
 Neo-liberalism, liberal institutionalism or neo-liberal institutionalism is a progression for liberal thinking
 yah tark detaa he ki antarrashtriya sansthaayen raashtra-rajyon ko antarrashtriya vyavastha main safaltaapurvak sahyog karne ke liye anumati de sakati hai
 Answer- Liberal theory argues that states within the modern and globalized world are actually stepping up for cooperation to ensure their security and sovereign interests
 yah siddhant vishesh rup se samprabhutaa or swaittata kii avadharanaon kii phir se vyakhya karne main laga he
 The concept of autonomy becomes a problematic concept, shifting away from the concept of independence, self-determination, a fully responsible agency and a sense of duty
 mahatvapurn baat yah he ki swaittata sushasan ke liye kshamta ke rup main hoti he
 Similarly, sovereignty also experiences a change from right to duty
 rachnawad yaa saamaajik rachnawad nav udaaravaadi or nav yathartwaadee antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhanton ke prabhutv ke saamne ek chunauti ke rup main varnit kiya jaataa he

 yah siddhant antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhanton kii vaigyanik vidhi or antarrashtriya shakti ke utpaadan main siddhanton kii bhoomika ko dhyaan main rakhkar ek bahes ke rup main ubhara
 Emanuel Adler has stated that constructivism is a middle ground in the theories of rational and interpretive international relations
 marxvad or nav-marxvad antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhanton ke sanrachnawadi maandand hai, jo yathartwaadee or udaaravaadeeyon ke rajya sangharsh yaa sahyog ke drishy ko asweekaar karte hai or inke bajaay ye aarthik or bhautik pahaluon par dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 The feminist approach to international relations became popular in the 1990s
 yah drushtikon is baat par jor detaa he ki mahilaon ke anubhavon ko antarrashtriya sambandhon ke adhyayan se lagaataar baahar rakhaa ja rahaa he
 Feminists in international relations argue that gender relations are integral to international relations
 atah rajanyik mahilaon or vaivaahik sambandhon par bhi dhyaan diya janaa chahie jo sex ke avaidh vyapaar ko suvidhajanak banane main bhoomika nibhaate hai

 State cartel theory in international relations comes from the ancient institutionalized theory of economics
 is siddhant kii german prishthbhumi he, kyonki germany pehle ucchtam viksit aarthik utpaadak sangh or clasical cartil siddhant kii mathrubhumi thi

 Answer: Structuralism differs from most other approaches in international politics, as it does not see itself as a doctrine, school, or paradigm that only keeps track of a single subject
 iske bajaay, uttar -sanrachnawadi drushtikon ek lokachar, tarika or drushtikon he jo vishesh dhang se aalochanaon kii jaanch evam khoj karata he
 Post-structuralism views criticism in an inherently positive way that creates conditions for exploring alternatives

 Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling was a philosopher from Germany
 lagaataar parivartit hone kii prakruti ke kaaran shelling ke darshan ko samajhnaa kathin samajha jaataa he
 Schelling was born on 27 January 1775 in Leunburg, a small town in Verteburg
 usne darshan or ishvarshastra kaa adhyayan 1790 se 1795 tak tuvinjan vishvavidhyalay ke theolagical seminary main kiya
 He had been a student of Kant, Fichte and Spinoza
 higel or holderlin uske samakaleen vidhyaarthee the
 In 1798, he became a professor of philosophy at Jena
 san 1803 ke uparaant burjberg, munich or arlanjan main vibhinn padon par kaary kiya
 In the end he was called to Berlin to stop Hegel's influence but he did not succeed in his objective
 san 1854 main uski mrityu hui
 Schelling's major works are: Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature, the Soul of the World, First Sketch of a System of the Philosophy of Nature, System of Transcendental Idealism, Boono and the Divine and Natural Principal of Kings, Critical Journal of Philosophy, History of Philosophy
 san 1856 main shelling ke putr dwaara sampadit complit works ov shelling' ke naam se uski sab rachanaayen 14 bhaagon main prakashit huin
 In Schöling's philosophical thinking, three turns are clearly visible
 prarambh main vah fikhte ke darshan se prabhavit tha or usee ko viksit karne main vyast rahaa
 Then, influenced by Brno and Spinoza, he began to accept nature and mind, the two sides of the ultimate element
 tisare mode main shelling ne apni moulikta pradarshit kii, kintu uske is samay ke vichaar bhi jecove bohem se milte julate hai
 Now he started thinking that the world was born of God
 shelling ke samay main germany higel ke darshan se abhibhoot tha
 Therefore, Schelling could not open his mouth during Hegel's lifetime
 san 1934 main higel kii mrityu ke baad usne uskaa virodh prakat kiya
 He considered his religious and mythological views to be an acceptable complement to Hegel's negative logical or hypothetical philosophy
 shelling ke vichaar se man or prakruti ek hi tatv ke do paksh hai
 Nature is the visible mind and mind is the unseen nature
 man or prakruti ke isi sambandh ke kaaran ham prakruti ko samaj sakate hai
 Nature also has life, thoughts and purpose
 ek hi shakti man main swachetan prathit hoti he or indriyon, pashupravriti, angik vikaas, rasinic prakriya, vidyut or gurutvkarshan main achetan rup se kaary karti he
 The blind subconscious power that conducts our body becomes self-conscious in the mind and is called the soul
 shelling man or prakruti ko spinoja kii bhanti paramtatv ke do samanaantar paksh nahin maanata
 They are two different levels or ages in the development of absolute mind
 nirpeksh man main kramik utkranti hua karti he
 His ultimate goal is to achieve self-consciousness
 shelling ke antim darshanik vichaar kevlopadaneshwarwadi prathit hote hai
 The world is like a living, continuously developing, contingent creation
 iske prayek ang kaa apana mahatv he
 By ignoring them, the macro form of the world cannot be understood
 isi prakaar sansar kaa prayek ang bhi samgr par avlambit he
 Shelling tries to prove this truth in many ways
 ek to vah sansar ko buddhipradhan samajhataa he, isliye buddhi ke dwaara use janaa bhi ja saktaa he
 Secondly, the history of the world is rational, so its creation-development-sequence can be expressed in logical language
 shelling antargyaan kii sarthakata bhi sweekaar karata he
 Intuition derives basic logic and on the basis of them we can accept the creation of rational theory of the world
 shelling kala ke paryaavaran main rah rahaa tha
 Impressed by that, he has accepted that the world is an artistic creation
 nirpeksh satta vishwa kii rachana karke apane uddeshy kii purti karti he
 Therefore, the highest work of man is to create art
 kala main sabhi prakaar ke dwait saamanjasy praapt kar lete hai
 Nature itself is a great poem
 kala main uskaa anaavaran hota he
 The surgeon of art is like a surgeon of nature
