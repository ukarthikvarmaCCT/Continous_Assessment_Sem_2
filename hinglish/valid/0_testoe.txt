 a warship is a vessel built to do battle
 yupoton kaa nirmaan aamtaur par vyapaarik jalayanon se purnataya bhinn rup se hota he
 Along with being armed, warships are also designed to withstand the damage they cause, as well as being faster and easier to move than commercial ships
 ek vyapaarik jalayaan ke vipareet, ek yudhpot aamtaur par keval apane swayan ke chaalak dal ke liye hathiyaar, gola barood, tathaa aapurti ko dhota he 
 yudhpot aamtaur par nausena kii sampatti hote hai, haalanki kabh-kabhi kuch vyaktiyon athwa companiyon dwaara bhi inhen rakhaa jaataa he
 In wartime, the difference between warships and merchant ships often obscures
 yuddh ke samay main vyapaarik jahaaz aksar sashastr rahete hai tathaa sahaayak yupoton ke rup main prayog kiye jate hai, udhaaharan ke liye pratham vishwa yuddh ke kyuu-ships tathaa dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke sashastr vyapaarik crugers
 17veen shatabdi tak yah aam tha ki vyapaarik jalayanon ko nausainik seva main prayog kiya jaye tathaa yah bhi asaamaanya nahin tha ki nausainik bede main aadhe se adhik vyapaarik jalayaan shaamil hon
 19veen sadi main samudri dakaiton ke khatre ke samaapt hone tak bade vyapaarik jalayanon, jaise galliens ko sashastr rakhana ek aam pratha thi
 Warships were also used as military carriers or shipping ships, as the French Navy used in the 18th century or the Japanese Navy during World War II
 mesopotamia, pracheen faras, pracheen greece, tathaa roman samrajya ke samay main gali sarvaadhik prachlit prakaar ke yudhpot hote the, yah ek lambaa, sankara jalayaan hota tha jise mallahon kii kataron ke dwaara shakti milti thi, iskaa dizine shatru ke jalayaan se takaraa kar use dubaane ke liye hota tha, athwa yah shatru ke baraabar aakar chalata tha jisase unpar aamane-saamne akraman kiya ja saktaa tha
 The first fleet of warships equipped with artillery evolved from the Hellenistic era, with the development of slings and refinements in its technology in the fourth century BCE
 duusari or pehali sadi i
pus
 main bumadhya sagar main raajnneetik ekikaran ke saath, nausainik topakhane prayog se baahar ho gaye
 The later Antiquities and Medieval until the 16th century were based on naval warships, using them to aid the crew's swords and various missiles, such as bows and arrows, and arrows dropped from heavy crossbows on the vessel's percolate
 Wars were fought with
 nausainik yuddh main mukhya rup se takkar maarna tathaa boarding kriyaayein shaamil thim isliye yupoton ko vishisht rup se visheshikrut hone kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti thi
 Naval artillery was developed again in the 14th century, but the artillery at sea did not become particularly prevalent until they were replenished and made fit to be repelled in the same war
 badi sankhya main topein le ja sakane laayak jalayaan ke aakaar ke kaaran nauka-aadhaarit pranodan asambhav ho gaya tha, evam isiilie yudhpot mukhya rup se paalon par aadhaarit the
 Pal-based man-of-war emerged during the 16th century
 17veen shatabdi ke madhya tak yupoton ke donon ore broadside par lagaai jane vaali topon kii sankhya badhati ja rahi thi, tathaa yudhakshetra main prayek yudhpot kii maarak kshamta ke purna prayog kii yudhnitiyon kaa vikaas ho rahaa tha
 The man-of-war had now developed into a ship of the line
 18veen sadi main frigate tathaa sloop-of-waar - jo apane chote aakaar ke kaaran yuddh kshetra ke liye anupyukt the - vyapaarik jalayanon ke kafile ke saath chalate the, shatru ke jalayanon kii soochna dete the tathaa shatru ke samudr tat kii nakaabandi karte the
 During the 19th century there was a revolution in propulsion, armament and the manufacture of warships
 bhaap ke ingine prakaash main aa gaye, shuruyaat main 19veen sadi ke duusare chauthai bhaag main ve sahaayak shaktistrot ke rup main the
 The Crimean War greatly stimulated the development of cannons
 visphotak golon kii shuruuaat ke kaaran bade yupoton ke donon ore tathaa deck par armar ke liye pehle lohe tathaa phir ispaat kaa prayog kiya jane laga
 The first iron-clad warships, the French Gloar and the British Warrior, made wooden vessels out of circulation
 dhaatu ne jaldi hi yudhpot nirmaan ke liye mukhya saamagree ke rup main lakdi kii jagah le lee
 From the 1850s, steam-powered warships replaced sail-powered ships, while sail-powered frigates were replaced by steam-powered cruisers
 gum sakane vaale barbet tathaa turet ke avishkaar ne yupoton ke aayudh ko bhi badal diya, ab topon ko jalayaan ke disha ke saapeksh swatantra rup se nishaanaa lagane ke liye prayog kiya ja saktaa tha tathaa ab badi topon kii kam sankhya ko dhone kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The last major innovation during the 19th century was the development of torpedoes and torpedo boats
 chote, tej tarpeado naukaaen mahange yupoton ke bede banane kaa vikalp uplabdh karaati thim
 Another revolution in warship design occurred soon after the turn of the century, when Britain launched the all-big-cannon-warship Dreadnought in 1906
 bhaap kii terbine se chaalit, sabhi tatkaaleen yupoton se, jinhen isane usee kshan prachlan se baahar kar diya, yah bada, tej tathaa baari topon se las tha
 In other countries, similar ships were quickly built
 britain ne pehle battlecruzar kaa vikaas bhi kiya
 With heavy cannons similar to the Dreadnought and the larger plow Battlecruiser, the armor had to be abandoned to gain speed
 Battlecruisers were faster and more powerful than all erstwhile cruisers, which they drove out, but Battlecruisers were far more vulnerable than the then warships
 tarpeado naav vidhvansak kaa vikaas bhi drednot ke samakaleen hi kiya gaya tha
 These destroyers were larger, faster and equipped with larger cannons than torpedo boats, developed to protect the main ships from torpedo boats
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke prarambh hone se pehle germany or great britain ek baar phir se atlantic sagar kii do sabase badi shaktiyon ke rup main ubhare
 varasiles kii sandhi ke antargat germany kii nausena kuch chote jalayanon tak hi simit thi
 But clever names, such as "pocket Battleship", kept the British and French commands deceived
 ve berukhi aashcharya main pad gaye jab jalayanon, jaise admiral graph spi, scornhorst tathaa nisenau aadi mitra rashtron kii aapurti shrinkhalaaon par lagaataar akraman karte rahe
 The biggest threat however was the presentation of Kriegsmarine's most dangerous weapons - the Bismarck and the Tirpitz
 bismark ko uttari atlantic main ek bheeshan tathaa muthbhed kii ek choti shrinkhalaa main dubaa diya gaya, jabaki tirapitz ko areef dwaara dubaaye jane se pehle usne halchal utpann kii thi
 By 1943, the Royal Navy had dominated the European society
 dwitiya vishwa yuddh ne yupoton kii dizin tathaa bhoomika main baari parivartan kiya
 For the first time, the aircraft carrier became the first choice in the role of the main ship in the naval task force
 itihaas main dwitiya vishwa yuddh ekmaatr aisa yuddh he jisamen vimaanvaahi jahaajon ke samoohon ke bich anek ladaaiyaan hui thim
 Radar use was first seen in World War II itself
 isamen pehali baar aisi nausainik ladaai bhi dekhi gayi jisamen donon pakshon ke jalayanon ne kabhi bhi sidhe na ladate hue vimaanon ko bhej kar hamale kiye, jaisaa ki coral sagar kii ladaai main hua
 The first practical submarine was built at the end of the 19th century, but the submarines became truly dangerous after the development of torpedoes
 pandubbiyon ne pratham vishwa yuddh ke ant tak apni kshamta sabit kar di thi
 During World War II, the u-boats of the German Navy's submarine fleet were defeated to the brink of surrender to Britain and also caused major damage to the United Nations coastal ships
 pandubbiyon kii safalataa ne pratham tathaa dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan pandubbi-rodhi convoy escorts ke vikaas kaa maarg prashast kiya, jaise ki vidhvansak escort
 bhrampurna dhang se, in nae prakaaron ke naam paal yug ke chote yupoton se liye gaye hai, jaise corwet, sloop tathaa frigate
 a major change in naval war was the arrival of aircraft carriers
 sarvapratham taranto main or uske pashchaat parl harbar main, vimaanvaahi jahaaj ne shatru ke jalayanon par, jo sataha par chalane vaale jahaajon ke drishy kshetra va paraas ke baahar the, nirnaayak hamalaa karne kii apni kshamta kaa parichay diya
 By the end of World War II, the aircraft carrier had become the dominant warship
 aadhunik yudhpot aamtaur par saat mukhya shreniyon main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai, ye hai: vimaanvaahi jahaaj, crugers, vidhvansak, fregates, corwets, pandubbiyaan tathaa amphibiyas asoult jalayaan
 byttleship kaa aathvaan varg ho saktaa he, lekin vartmaan main duniya kii kisi bhi nausena main prayog main nahin he
 Only American dormant Iowa-class battleships still exist that can be called combatants, and battleships in general find it difficult to reintroduce as a class of ships without redefining
 vidhvansak ko aamtaur se sabase aadhunik samudri nausenaon kaa sabase pramukh sataha par chalane vaala yudhpot mana ja saktaa he
 However, it is worth noting that cruisers, destroyers, frigates and corvettes, which used to have distinct roles and sizes, are now blurred
 zyaadaatar jahaaz sataha, pandubbi or vimaan rodhi hathiyaaron ke mishran ke saath sashastr hone lage hai
 Class designations no longer reliably indicate the displacement sequence, and the size of the vessels has increased far beyond the definitions presented in the 20th century
 puraane or aadhunik jahaazon ke bich ek or mahatvapurn antar yah he ki sabhi aadhunik yudhpot "soft" hote hai, unamem dwitiya vishwayuddh tathaa usase bhi puraani diginon main paaya jane vaala motaa armar tathaa ubhari hui torapeado rodhi suraksha kaa abhaav hota he
 Most navies also include a variety of aid and auxiliary vessels, such as minesweeper, patrol boats and offshore patrol vessels

 Since then, this party has been in the hands of this family

 In this sense, it is the fourteenth largest city in the United States by area
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles 
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960
 The city is located in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 ° C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 ° f warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 °F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 °F, with overnight lows of 63 °F 
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 °F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 °F and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 ° f and 73 ° f in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 ° f in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 ° f in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 ° f on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 ° f on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical coral tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the bird of paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 jabaki kanak kii palomi naamak ek ladki dwaara aalochana kii jaati he or baar-baar maasi sa dwaara nuksaan pahunchaaya jaataa he, par kanak apane maarg main ruukti nahin
 Later, Masi Sa's ruthless son Aditya also tries to harm Kanaka

 It is a kind of cognitive bias and systematic error of inductive reasoning

 Since most myspace pages are designed by individuals with little HTML experience, a large number of pages do not meet the valid HTML or CSS criteria set by the W3C
 Poorly formatted code can cause access problems for people using software such as screen readers
 mispes mukh prishth, yatha 20 may 2009, W3C satyapak kaa prayog karte hue kareeb 101 truti ke saath HTML satyaapan main vifal ho jaataa he

 Users who enter their login information in a fake login bar that appears, and They will also become victims of phishing and their account will be used to send undesirable e-mails to other members, thus it will spread this security problem

 Such relationships lack depth in real relationships

 After this the anti-girmit campaign continued to gain momentum
 march 1917 main girmit virodhiyon ne angarez sarkaar ko ek ultimatum diya ki may tak yah pratha samaapt kii jaye
 Seeing the increasing anger of the people, finally the government had to think seriously

 In this sense, it is the fourteenth largest city in the United States by area
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles 
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960
 The city is located in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 ° C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 ° f warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 °F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 °F, with overnight lows of 63 °F 
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 °F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 °F and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 ° f and 73 ° f in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 ° f in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 ° f in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 ° f on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 ° f on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical coral tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the bird of paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions
