 In normal life, many spelling mistakes in Hindi are seen on computer, internet and letters
 ashuddh vartanee bhashaa kii sundarata ko kharaab karti he
 Therefore, this article talks about common mistakes made in Hindi
 ye ve ashuddhiyaan hai jo aamtaur computer athwa anya computing divison par typing ke dauraan hoti hai
 In English these types of impurities are called typos
 kai baar to in par tipakarta kaa dhyaan nahin jaataa, kai baar dhyaan jane par bhi aalasyavash vah najrandaaj kar detaa he
 Another reason is also that many times the typing tool is not aware of the type of character or mark by the typing tool being used
 aisa suvidha ke chakkar main, kisi chihn ko tip karne kaa sahi tarika na jaanane ke kaaran athwa chihn vishesh ko tip karne kii sulabhta uplabdh na hone ke kaaran hota he
 While typing on a computer, most people use fullstop instead of a full stop because of laziness or not knowing how to type the character
 purnaviram ke sthaan par phulstop kaa prayog karne se devanagari kii sundarata bhi prabhavit hoti he tathaa computing main anya jatiltaayen bhi aati hai
 In Hindi, space does not come before any punctuation marks such as a full stop, question mark etc
 aajkal kai mudrit pustakon, patrikaon main aisa hone ke kaaran log aisa hi tip karne lagate hai jo ki galat he
 Space should not come before any punctuation
 angreji main sankshepikaran ke liye phulstop kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, hindi main is kaary ke liye laghav chihn hota he
 Often this icon is not accessible on the keyboard, people use fullstop instead, when it is impure
 is chihn ko tip karne kaa saralatam tarika he ki kisi bhi verde prosesar main iske unicode kuta 0970 ko tip karen tathaa use salact karke alt-x dabaa den, vah laghav chihn main badal jaayegaa
 Example: True - Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, Incorrect - Dr
 Rajendra Prasad, True - m A, f - M
 a
 hindi shunya ank kaa chihn bhi isse miltaa-julata hone se kai baar log galati se laghav chihn kii jagah hindi ke shunya ank kaa prayog kar lete hai
 The difference in these is that one minus the minus sign is smaller than the other zero, where the horizontal sign is in the middle of the line, the minus sign is horizontally down
 kai log jaankaree ke abhaav main sanskrit main shlokon ke ant main likhe jane vaale dabl dande ke sahi chihn ke sthaan par do purnaviram daal dete hai
 If you do not have this symbol in your typing tool to enter the correct mark, then type its Unicode code 0965 in any word processor and select it and press alt-x, it will be converted into double sentence
 vaakya-ant hetu purnaviram / dand nirdhaarit he
 a double-sentence is prescribed for the end of the paragraph, the norm of which will be more scientifically and technically accurate if double sentence is typed at the end of rhyme in the poem / verse, but at the end of each paragraph
 kai baar tipakarta visarg ke sthaan par usase milte julate chihn colon ko tip kar dete hai jo ki sarvatha ashuddh he
 Standard Hindi keyboard inscript can be obtained by pressing the key - with the Visarg Shift
 anya vikalp ke taur par kisi bhi verde prosesar main iske unicode code 0903 ko tip karen tathaa use salact karke alt-x dabaa den, vah visarg chihn main badal jaayegaa
 Many times the typers type the decimal mark fullstop instead of the decimal mark which is completely impure
 in donon kaa antar dekhnaa ho to donon ko kisi verde prosesar main tip kar font sies bahut bada karke dekhen
 Middle Dot should be used for the decimal sign which is above the Del key in the Numerical Keypad
 jabaki Full stop ke liye sirf code nirdhaarit he
 Due to lack of proper knowledge of Panchamaksharas, people often misuse the word 'N' instead of half their letters like 'pandit' instead of 'pandit', 'windows' instead of 'windows', 'chanchal'
 'chanchal' etc
 in place of ye adhiktar ashuddhiyaan 'ji' tathaa 'n' ke sthaan par 'n' ke prayog kii hoti hai
 Rule: If there is a sound of reminder before the first four letters of every alphabet group of the alphabet, then the fifth letter of that class seems to be halved
 arthath kavarg ke pehle chaar varnon se pehle aadha ng, chavarg ke pehle chaar varnon se pehle aadha na, tavarg ke pehle chaar varnon se pehle aadha na, tavarg ke pehle chaar varnon se pehle aadha na tathaa pavarg ke pehle chaar varnon se pehle aadha m aata he
 Examples: aadhunik hindi main panchamaaksharon ke sthaan par suvidha hetu keval anuswaar kaa bhi prayog kar liya jaataa he yadhyapi yah devanagari kii sundarata ko kam karata he
 Such as: Pankaj - Pankaj, Shanti - Shanti, Tradition - Tradition
 visheshkar na tathaa ji kaa prayog kaaphi kam ho gaya he
 According to the tradition of Wikipedia, Panchamakshars should be used in articles related to Sanskrit, Religion and Indian Culture whereas modern Hindi can be used for simplicity in articles related to science, mathematics, technology etc
 haan lekh ke sheershak ko shuddh uccharan tathaa vartanee kii drushti se panchamakshar main rakhaa jaay, chaahe vah kisi bhi vishay se sambandhit ho
 For search and redirection, the modern spelling name should be redirected to the title with the traditional signature so that it is pure pronunciation and spelling
 udhaaharan ke liye pandit ko pandit par punarnirdeshit kiya janaa chaiye
 It is only appropriate to use the input sound "A" or pure spelling after its volume because the point of the reminder is not visible in it
 udhaaharan - font ke sthaan par font upyukt he
 Similarly, even after the second incoming sound "ऍ" and its volume, the point of the reminder is either not visible or there is confusion of the moon, so the use of pure spelling in its place is also appropriate
 udhaaharan - and ke sthaan par and upyukt he
 In the conjuncts formed by the treaty of Pancham Varna, the latter letter appears below "J" and "J"
 is prakaar banane vaale sanyuktakshron ko mangal aadi adhiktar unicode font sahi prakaar se nahin dikhaa pate, baayin taraf dikhaate hai
 The Unicode font named Sanskrit 2003 correctly displays such conjuncts
 udhaaharan - ganga kaa sahi rup he
 Writing mistake: Both 'A' and 'O' are called incoming sounds which have come from foreign languages especially English in Hindi
 inkaa upyog angreji kii do vishisht dhvaniyon ke liye hota he
 The sound of 'au' is almost between 'o' and 'au', eg: boss, hot etc
 bahudhaa log saamaanya lekhan main bhi tathaa computer padd tankan me bhi '' ke sthaan par '' likh dete hai
 This is due to two reasons, one is that Indians are unable to assimilate them many times due to foreign sounds and secondly due to lack of 'A' sign in the typing tool on the computer
 kai baar typing aujaar main sulabh hone par bhi log aalasyavash 'aa' kii hi maatra laga dete hai
 However, there are some words whose forms of 'aa' are also prevalent in Hindi, such as doctors and colleges
 in maamalon main 'aa' vaala rup bhi chal jaataa he kyonki inkaa 'aa' vaala uccharan bhi prachlit he, yadhyapi 'o' vaala hi likhnaa behatar he
 But it is totally wrong to write words that have only the sound of 'A' as 'A'
 udhaaharan ke liye internet par 'blog' ko bahudhaa galat rup se 'blog' likh diya jaataa he yadhyapi 'blog' bolta koi nahin
 Pronunciation mistake: Since 'A' is a foreign sound, many Indians are unable to assimilate it and pronounce the words 'A' as 'A'
 udhaaharan ke liye 'ol' ke sthaan par 'aal', 'olso' ke sthaan par 'aalso', 'body' ke sthaan par 'bari' aadi
 Input sound is almost between 'ऍ', 'A' and 'A', eg 'jack', 'mack'
 hindi main aamtaur par iske liye nikatatam varna 'i' kaa upyog kar liya jaataa he jaise 'jak' kii bajaay 'jaik' aadi
 It is not so impure but the use of the quantity of 'A' in place of 'ऍ' is totally inappropriate and is against Devanagari's phonetic properties - pronunciation and symmetry of writing
 is tarah ke galat prayog ke udhaaharan hai 'red' ke sthaan par 'red' likhnaa jo ki Raid kaa sahi lekhan he
 Similarly, writing 'test' instead of 'test' which is the correct writing of Taste, 'guest' instead of 'gast' which is wrong
 ek anya ashuddhi jo ki print media main dekhne ko milti he - 'ji' ke sthaan par 'a' ke upar '' chihn laga varna
 It is not possible to create such a character in a Unicode font but is created in a non-unicode font
 aisi galati aam taur par 'ji' se shuru hone vaale varnon main dikhaayi detii he
 Often, anusvara is written in place of anusvara and in place of anuasik
 visheshkar anunasik ke sthaan par anuswaar ko likhe jane kii galati adhik prachlit he or ise ek prakaar kii aghoshit sweekruti bhi mil gayi he
 Some examples are, laughing instead of laughing, feathers instead of feathers etc
 in donon ke antar ko spasht karne ke liye bahudhaa hans tathaa hans kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 See information related to the use of Anusarav and Anusani here
 urdu se hindi main liye gayi shabdon main nukta lagaaya jaataa he
 Apart from this, nukte is also used in some words of foreign languages like English
 nukta bhashaa vishesh kii sahi dhwani ko prakat karata he lekin hindi main likhte samay praayah kai baar log nukta lop kar dete hai
 Although this is not considered a serious mistake
 nukta chhod dena vishesh notice nahin kiya jaataa lekin jahaan nukta na laganaa ho vahaan laga dena ajeeb lagata he jaise 'fal' ke sthaan par 'fal' tathaa 'phir' ke sthaan par 'fir' saraasar galat he
 Typing is also one of the reasons for needlessly pointing
 udhaaharan ke liye baraa ikhmai naamak aujaar se tip karte samay 'F' kunji dabaane se 'fa' chhapata he jabaki 'pha' ke liye 'P+H' dabaanaa padataa he
 That is why many people become habituated to writing 'F' by 'F' idlely
 kai baar nukta aprihaary bhi ho saktaa he
 See an example: The English letter 'G' is pronounced 'G', and 'Z' is pronounced 'zee'
 in donon ke uccharan kaa antar nukte bina spasht nahin ho saktaa
 Another suggestion is that while there is a possibility of changing the meaning, a deflector like nukta should be used
 jahaan bina nukte ke arth sahi samajha ja sake, vahaan bina nukte ke kaam chalaaya janaa chahie
 a general rule about the tip should be remembered - yes, there is doubt about the use of the tip, do not use the tip there
 'zarurat' ke sthaan par 'jarurat' chal jayega, par 'majaburi' ke sthaan par 'mazaboori' nahin
 See this article for the correct use of nukte
 hindi main bahut se shabd hai jinaki vartanee aam taur par galat likhi jaati he
 Due to the presence of these spells in the print media, the common man starts to understand them correctly
 uparokt mukhya lekh main is prakaar ke shabdon kii suchi di gayi he
 a -> Cai, b -> Khai etc
 kai log 'sha' tathaa 'sha' kaa uccharan bhi 'sa' kii tarah hi karte hai jaise 'inglish' ko 'inglis' bolnaa, 'shadyantra' ko 'sadyantra' bolnaa aadi
 'R' is pronounced as 'ri' in North India and 'ru' in South India
 iskaa sahi uccharan kalkram main lupt ho chukaa he
 'gy' is pronounced differently in different parts of India, it is often pronounced as 'gy' in the Hindi language regions of North India
 iskaa sahi uccharan bhi vartmaan main lupt ho chukaa he
 Nowadays, the pronunciation of 'ksh' is generally heard like 'chhath' as in saying 'kshatriya' as 'chhatriya'
 praayah panchamaaksharon se aparichit log 'ng' kaa uccharan 'd' kii tarah karte hai
 Some people pronounce half the letters in some words as full letters
 udhaaharan ke liye 'prashn' kaa uccharan 'prashan' kii tarah, 'mahatv' kaa uccharan 'mahatav' kii tarah, 'praytn' kaa uccharan 'prayatan' kii tarah aadi
 There are many words that had different meanings, but they have started being used in a different sense than being misinterpreted
 udhaaharan ke liye kilaafat kaa arth "caliph kaa pad or uski satta" hota he lekin aam janata jisamen padhe-likhe patrkaar bhi shaamil hai, kilaafat ko mukaalifat ke arth main hi dhadlle se istemaal kar rahe hai

 jo rachana shravan dwaara hi nahin apitu drushti dwaara bhi darshakon ke hriday main rasanubhuti karaati he use naatak yaa drishy-kavy kehete hai
 The play has more elegance than audio poetry
 shravy kavy hone ke kaaran yah lok chetana se apekshaakrit adhik ghanishtha rup se sambhddha he
 Folk consciousness in the Natyasastra has been considered the primary inspiration for the writing and staging of the play
 naatak kii ginati kaavyon main he
 Poetry is considered to be of two types - audio and visual
 isi drishy kavy kaa ek bhed naatak mana gaya he
 But mainly because of its eclipse by sight, visuals have started to call poetry as drama
 bharatmuni kaa naatyashaastra is vishay kaa sabase pracheen granth miltaa he
 The Agnipuran also has a representation of the characteristics of drama etc
 usamen ek prakaar ke kavy kaa naam prakeern kaha gaya he
 This book has two distinctions - poetry and actors
 agnipurana main drishy kavy yaa roopak ke 27 bhed kahe gaye hai— Characteristics, distinctions, etc
 of the play are given more clearly in the literature
 upar likhaa ja chukaa he ki drishy kavy ke ek bhed kaa naam naatak he
 There are two main categories of visual poetry - metaphor and metaphor
 roopak ke das bhed hai— roopak, naatak, prakaran, bhaan, vyayog, samavakaar, dim, ihamrig, ankavithi or prahasan
 There are eighteen distinctions of 'uparupaka' - Natika, Trotak, Goshthi, Sattak, Natyarasak, Departure, Ullapya, Kavya, Observance, Rasak, Sanlapak, Shrigadit, Shimpak, Vilasika, Durmallika, Kesika, Halisha and Bhanika
 uparyukt bhedon ke anusaar naatak shabd drishy kavy maatr ke arth main bolte hai
 According to the literature, the play should be written with a 'famous circle'
 vah bahut prakaar ke vilaas, sukh, dukh, tathaa anek rason se yukt hona chahie
 It should contain from five to ten digits
 naatak kaa nayak dhirodatt tathaa prakhyat vansh kaa koi pratapi purush yaa rajarshi hona chahie
 The principal or angi rasa of the play is Shringar and Veer
 shesh ras gaun rup se aate hai
 The metaphor in which tranquility, peace, compassion etc
 can not be called drama
 sandhisthal main koi vismayajanak vyapaar hona chahie
 Mars must be shown in the epilogue
 viyogant naatak sanskrit alankaar shaastra ke viruddh he
 The action that takes place before the acting starts, is called puvarang
 purvarang, ke uparaant pradhan nat yaa sutaradhar, jise sthaapak bhi kehete hai, aakar sabha kii prashansa karata he phir nat, nati sutaradhar ityadi paraspar vaartalap karte hai jisamen khele janevaale naatak kaa prastaav, kavi-vansh-varnan aadi vishay aa jate hai
 This part of the play is called the prologue
 jis itivrutt ko lekar naatak rachaa jaataa he use 'vastu' kehete hai
 There are two types of 'object' - official object and relevant object
 jo samast itivrutt kaa pradhan nayak hota he use 'adhikari' kehete hai
 Whatever is described in relation to this officer is called 'official object'; Like, the character of Rama in Ramlila
 is adhikari ke upkaar ke liye yaa raspushti ke liye prasangvash jiskaa varnan aa jaataa he use praancegik vastu kehete hai; jaise sugriv, aadi kaa charitra
 'to bring to the fore' means to present a visual face
 atah avasthanurup anukaran yaa swaang kaa naam hi abhinay he
 There are four types of acting - Aangik, Vachik, Dietary and Satvik
 angon kii cheshtaa se jo abhinay kiya jaataa he use angik, vachanon se jo kiya jaataa he use vaachik, bhes banaakar jo kiya jaataa hai use aharya tathaa bhaavon ke udrek se camp, swead aadi dwaara jo hota he use satvik kehete hai
 The seed, point, flag, light and action in the play are achieved by these five
 jo baat munh se kehete hi chaaron ore fail jaay or falsiddhi kaa pratham kaaran ho use beej kehete hai, jaise venisanhaar naatak main bhim ke krodh par yudhisthir kaa utsaahvaaky draupadi ke keshmojan kaa kaaran hone ke kaaran beej he
 If one thing is fulfilled, then even if it is not related to the other sentence, bring such sentences in it which are not incompatible with the other sentence is 'point'
 bich main kisi vyapak prasang ke varnan ko pataakaa kehete hai— jaise uttarcharit main sugriv kaa or abhigyaan- shankutal main vidooshak kaa charitravarnan
 a country wide characterization is called Prakari
 aarambh kii hui kriya kii falsiddhi ke liye jo kuch kiya jaay use kaary kehete hai; jaise, ramlila main ravan vadh
 One topic is being discussed, in the meantime, if another topic is present and it is known in the mail with the first topic, there is a place of sign, like, in Ramcharit, Ram is saying to Sita - "oh dear! i am not intolerant about you, if it is unbearable, then only your antagonism, in the meantime, the Pratihari comes and says: God! Offense present
 yahan ' upasthit' shabd se 'virah upasthit' aisi prathit hota he or ek prakaar kaa chamatkaar maaloom hota he
 Many similar drama-related skills have been introduced in Sanskrit literature and various types of differentiation have been shown
 aajkal deshbhashaon main jo nae naatak likhe jate hai unamem sanskrit naatakon ke sab niyamon kaa paalan yaa vishyon kaa samavesh anaavashyak samajha jaataa he
 Bharatendu Harishchandra writes - 'like a Sanskrit drama, it is futile to research them in Hindi drama or to write a play diligently in a Natakang; Because by editing the ancient natakadi, adorning the modern signs, the opposite happens and the effort is wasted
 bharat main abhinay-kala or rangamanch kaa vaidic kaal main hi nirmaan ho chukaa tha
 After that, Sanskrit theater had reached the pinnacle of its progress - Bharati Muni's Natyashastra is the proof of this
 bahut pracheen samay main bharat main sanskrit naatak dharmik avasaron, saanskrithik parvon, saamaajik samarohon evam rajkeey bolchaal kii bhashaa nahin rahi to sanskrit naatakon kii manchikaran samaapt-sa ho gaya
 The promotion of plays in India is from very ancient times
 bharat muni kaa naatayashastra bahut purana he
 Nuts and dramas are mentioned in Ramayana, Mahabharata, Harivansh etc
 panini ne 'shilaali' or 'krishashv' naamak do natsutrakaron ke naam liye hai
 Shilali gets its name from Shukla Yajurvedi Shatapatha Brahmin and Samvediya Anupada Sutra
 vidwaanon ne jyotish kii gananaa ke anusaar shatapath brahman ko 4000 varsh se upar kaa batalaaya he
 Therefore, this opinion of some Western scholars rightly originated in drama in Greece or Greece, it is not right
 harivansh main likhaa he ki jab pradhyumna, samb aadi yadav rajkumaar vajranabh ke poor main gaye the tab vahaan unhone ramajanm or rambhaavisar naatak khele the
 Previously, he had tied the background, from which the women sang sweetly
 shur naamak yadav ravan bana tha, manovati naam kii stri rambha bani thi, pradhyumna nalkubar or samb vidooshak bane the
 Western scholars like Wilson etc
 have clearly acknowledged that the Hindus had developed drama on their own
 pracheen hindu raja bady bady rangashalas banavaate the
 Surguja is a hilly place in Madhya Pradesh, there are signs of a theater of this type found inside a cave
 yah thik he ki unaniyon ke aane ke purv ke sanskrit naatak aajkal nahin milte hai, par is baat se inkaa abhaav, itane pramaanon ke rahete, nahin mana ja saktaa
 It is possible, when the Hindu caste has got union with the well-to-do Greek caste, then just as some other things were accepted by each other
 isi prakaar naatak ke sambandh main kuch baaten hinduon ne bhi apane yahan lee hon
 Seeing the 'jawanika' name of the outer layer, some people suggest Yavana connection
 ankon main jo 'drishy' sanskrit naatakon main aae hai unase anumaan hota he ki in paton par chitra bane rahete the
 Astu more and more, it can be said in this subject that in ancient times, there used to be acting
 unamem chitrapat kaam main nahin laae jate the
 He was promoted after Alexander's arrival
 ab bhi ramlila, raasalila bina paradon ke hoti hi hai
 Democracy emerged in the regional languages in the medieval period
 yah vicitra sanyog he ki muslimkaal main jahaan shaskaon kii dharmakattarata ne bharat kii saahitiyik rang-parampara ko tod daalaa vahaan lokbhashaon main lokmanch kaa acha prasar hua
 Lokalharmi Natyamanch continued in the form of Raslila, Ramlila and Nautanki etc
 bhaktikaal main ek ore to braj pradesh main krishna kii raasalilaon kaa brajabhasha main atyadhik prachlan hua or duusari or vijaydashami ke avasar par samooche bharat ke chote-bade nagaron main ramlila badi dhoomdhaam se manaai jane lagi
 Literally, some Sanskrit dramas have also had Hindi chhayanuwad in this medieval period, such as Nevaaz 'abhigyan Shakuntal', Somnath's 'malati-madhav', Hridayaramcharit 'hanumannataka' etc
; Some original compositional interactive works were also done, such as Lachhiram's 'karunabharana', Raghuram Nagar's 'sabhasara', Ganesh poet's work 'pradyumnvijay' etc
; But the dramatic method was not completely maintained in them
 ye keval sanvadatmak rachanaayen hi kahi ja sakati hai
 Thus due to lack of literary vision and literary works, there was no tendency towards literary theater in the medieval period
 sach to yah he ki aadhunik kaal main vyavsaayik tathaa saahitiyik rangamanch ke udai se purv hamaare desh main ramlila, nautanki aadi ke lokmanch ne hi chaar-paanch sau varshon tak hindi rangamanch ko jivit rakhaa
 This folk-tradition is present in the entire country till date
 uttar bharat main ramlilaon ke atirikt mahabharat par aadhaarit ‘vir abhimanyu’, ‘satya harishchandra’ aadi drame tathaa ‘rup-basant’, ‘hir-raanjha’, ‘hakikatraay’, ‘bilwamangal’ aadi nautankiyan aaj tak prachlit hai
 Theater was encouraged in modern times with the establishment of the English state
 falat: samooche bharat main vyavsaayik naatak mandaliyaan sthapit huin
 The trend of Natyarangan first appeared in Bengali
 san 1835 i
 ke aasapaas kalakatta main kai avyavsaayik rangashaalaon kaa nirmaan hua
 Some of Calcutta's elite families and nobles had contributed to the creation of them and on the other hand the commercial drama was different from the unabashed effort of the circles
 banglaa ke is natya-srijan or natyarangan kaa adhyayan isliye mahatvapurn he, kyonki bharatendu harishchandr ke rangandolan ko isi se dasha, disha or prerana mili thi
 The plays which were composed in this early literary endeavor of Bengali were the chronicles or adaptations of the original Sanskrit or English plays
 spasht he ki bharatendu kaa aarmabhik prayaas bhi sanskrit naatakon ke chhayanuwaad kaa hi tha
 The first of the Hindi theatrical literary plays can be called 'inder Sabha' in Hindi Geetinatya Amanat which was played in the court of Nawab Wajid Alishah of Lucknow in 1853 AD
 isamen urdu-style kaa vaisaa hi prayog tha jaisaa parsi naatak mandaliyon ne apane naatakon main apanaaya
 a pure Hindi drama called 'janaki Mangal' was played in Kashi in 1862 AD
 uparyukt saahitiyik rangamanch ke uparyukt chhutput prayaas se bahut aage badhkar parsi mandaliyon-original victoria, ampress victoria, elfinston theetrical company, alfred theetrical tathaa new alfred company aadi-ne vyavsaayik rangamanch banaaya
 Firstly, Bombay and later Hyderabad, Lucknow, Banaras, Delhi, Lahore etc
 These companies started wandering all over the country to perform Hindi plays
 in parsi naatak mandaliyon ke liye pehle-pahal nasarbani khan sahab, raunak banarsi, vinayak prasad ‘talib’, ‘ahasan’ aadi lekhakon ne naatak likhe
 The main objective of these companies was cheap entertainment and earning public
 isi se ucchkoti ke saahitiyik naatakon se inkaa vishesh prayojan nahin tha
 She used to show religious-mythological and love-based plays in her theater
 saste or ashleel pradarshan karne main inhen jaraa bhi sankoch nahin tha
 This is to blame for corrupting people's interest
 bhraman ke kaaran in companiyon kaa rangamanch bhi inke saath ghumta rahata tha
 The establishment of a permanent theater was also not possible through him
 rangamanch kaa dhaanchaa balliyon dwaara nirmit kiya jaataa tha or stage par chitra-vicitra parde lataka die jate the
 His attention was paid to flashy costumes, new paintings of curtains and miraculous scenes
 pardon ko drishyon ke anusaar uthaaya-giraaya jaataa tha
 The musical instrument was organized in the next part of the stage
 gambhir drishyon ke bich-bich main bhi bhadde hasyapurna drishy jaanboojhkar rakhe jate the
 Shayari, ghazals and rhymes used to run a lot in between
 bhashaa urdu-hindi kaa mishrit rup thi
 The dialogues were versatile and rhymed
 radheshyaam kathavachak, narayanprasad betaab, aagaahashr kashmiri, harikrishna johar aadi kuch aise naatakkaar bhi hue hai jinhone parsi rangamanch ko kuch saahitiyik put dekar sudhaarney kaa praytn kiya he or hindi ko is vyavsaayik rangamanch par laane kii cheshtaa kii
 But due to professional instinct, improvisation on this theater was not possible
 isi se in naatakakaron ko bhi vyavsaayik ban janaa padaa
 Thus Parsi theater could not develop, nor could it become permanent
 hindi main naatakon kaa prarambh bharatendu harishchandra se mana jaataa he
 Bharatendu and his contemporary playwrights of that period composed plays for the development of public consciousness, so social problems of that time had a good opportunity to be expressed in plays
 jaisaaki kaha ja chukaa he, hindi main avyavsaayik saahitiyik rangamanch ke nirmaan kaa shriganesh aagaahasan ‘amaanat’ lakhanvi ke ‘inder sabha’ naamak geeti-roopak se mana ja saktaa he
 But the truth is that Inder Sabha was not really a theatrical work
 isamen shaamiyane ke neeche khulaa stage rahata tha
 The audience used to sit like a gimmick on three sides, on one side the seat of King Inder was put on the seat, along with chairs for the fairies
 sazindon ke peeche ek laal rang kaa pardaa lataka diya jaataa tha
 Characters were entered from behind it
 raja inder, pariyaan aadi paatr ek baar aakar vahiin upasthit rahete the
 They did not go back by speaking their dialogues
 us samay natyarangan itnaa lokapriy hua ki amaanat kii ‘inder sabha’ ke anukaran par kai sabhaayen rachi gai, jaise ‘madarilal kii inder sabha’, ‘daryai inder sabha’, ‘hawaii inder sabha’ aadi
 Parsi drama circles also adopted these synagogues and Majlisperistan
 ye rachanaayen naatak nahin thi or na hi inase hindi kaa rangamanch nirmit hua
 That is why Bharatendu Harishchandra used to call them 'natakabhas'
 unhone inaki parody ke rup main ‘bandar sabha’ likhi thi
 The era of Sanskrit plays began to change, then from the fourteenth century to the nineteenth century, they were replaced by folk plays in various Indian languages
 aaj alag-alag pradeshon main lok naatak bhinn-bhinn naamon se janaa jaataa he
 Isopanishad Shukla is a Upanishad under the Yajurvedic branch
 yah upanishad apane nanhen kalevar ke kaaran anya upanishdon ke bich behad mahatvapurn sthaan rakhata he
 There is no story in it, only self-description
 is upanishad ke pehle shloke ‘‘eshavasyamidansarvanyatkinch jagatyaan-jagat


’’ se lekar atharahawein shloke ‘‘agne nay suptha raye asman vidhwani dev vaunani vidvan


’’ tak shabd-shabd main maanon brahm-varnan, upasna, prarthana aadi zankrut he
 There is only one voice - of Brahman, of knowledge, of self-knowledge
 adbhut kalevar vaale is upanishad main ishwar ke sarvanirmaataa hone kii baat he saare brahmad ke maalik ko ingit kiya gaya he, satvik jeevanstyli kii baat kahi gai he ki duusare ke dhan par drushti mat daalo
 While living in this world, we have been told to live lifelessly
 isamen ‘asurya’ naamak lok kii baat aati he — asurya matlab ki surya se rahit lok
 The world where the sun cannot reach, the ultimate world filled with thick, dark darkness, that is, the womb
 kaha gaya he ki jo log aatm ko, apane ‘swa’ ko nahin pahachaanate hai, aatma ko jhuthla dete hai, nakaar dete hai or isi asweekaar tale puraa jivan bitaate hai unhen mrityu ke pashchaat usee andhtam lok yani ki asurya naamak lok main janaa padataa he arthath garbhavas karnaa padataa he, phir se janm lenaa padataa he
 Thus in this Upanishad, on the one hand, considering God as the Creator, on the other hand, indicates to live life by becoming a mere instrument, which on the other hand indicates not to forget self
 iske baad aatm ko nirupit karne kaa tathy aata he ki ‘vah’ achal he saath hi man se bhi zyada tivrgami he
 This self is a fast escape from all senses
 is upanishad main aatm / brahm ko 'maatarijva' naam se ingit kiya gaya he, jo ki sabhi kaaryakalapon ko vahan karne vaala, unhen sambal dene vaala he
 In order to describe the qualities of Brahma of 'atma', it is here that he is simultaneously, at the same time, wandering, as well as intransitive
 vah paas he or dur bhi
 Here he is indicated by several speeches - that he is omnipotent, bodiless, omniscient, self-born and the ruler of the mind
 is upanishad main vidya evam avidya donon kii baat kii gai he unke alag-alag kism ke gunon ko bataaya gaya he saath hi vidya evam avidya donon kii upasna ko varjit kiya gaya he — yahan yah saaf-saaf kaha gaya he ki vidya evam avidya donon kii upasna karne vaale ghaney andhkaar main jaakar girte hai saakaar kii prakruti kii upasna ko bhi yahan varjit mana gaya he lekin haan vidya evam avidya ko ek saath jaan lene vaala, avidya ko samajhakar vidya dwaara anushthanit hokar mrityu ko paar kar letaa he, vah mrityu ko jitkar amritatv kaa upbhog karata he yah sweekaarokti yahan he
 In this, considering both goodness and perishable, it is said that the attainment of indestructible element and consumption of nectar is said
 is upanishad ke antim shlokon main bade hi sundar upmaan aate hai — brahm ke mukh ko suvarna paatr se tanke hone kii baat saath hi surya se poshan karne vaale se prarthana kii
 Stitching from the suvarnapatra, the face of that self should be exposed so that the worshiper can understand, feel that the Kavah itself is Brahmarupa and all the deeds performed in the last verses come to be remembered by the mind and pray to Agni Once the physical body is transformed into ashes, it will orient it towards the ultimate destination from the divine path

 According to the description of Srimad Bhagavata Purana, when Krishna was still in his childhood, he was cremated by Acharya Gargacharya at Nandababa's house

 islam main do tarah ke talaaq ke bare main zikr he
 The first divorce is Al Sunnam, which is done according to the command of Prophet Mohammad
 jabaki doosraa, talaaq al biddat, jise baad main ijad kiya gaya
 There is no reference to the triple talaq directly in the Qur'an nor has the Prophet Mohammad said anything directly about it
 quran main sirf ek baar talaaq bolne se hi talaaq hone kaa zikr he
 But before this, several measures have also been suggested to resolve between the two
 sureh nisa-35 main kaha gaya he ki; Even after this, if both the husband and wife want to separate, then the husband will wait for his wife's special days
 khaas dinon ke guzar jane ke baad jab bivi paaq ho jaae to bina hambistar hue kam se kam do jummedaar logon ko gavaah bana kar unke saamne bivi ko ek talaaq de, yani shuhar har bivi se sirf itnaa kahe ki "main tumhe talaaq detaa hum"
 The wife can stay in the in-laws for up to three months after divorcing

 Adab: In the context of behavior, refers to prescribed Islamic etiquette: "refinement, good behavior, morality, civilization, civilization, humanity"
 Although the scope and description of Adib may vary in different cultures, these interpretations Private standing is generally concerned with the observation of certain behaviors

 Islam has rules of etiquette and a moral code covering every aspect of life
 musalmaan adab ko adatan ke taur par achche shishtachar, saujany, sammaan or upyuktata ke rup main sanderbhit karte hai, jaise ki shauchalay main pravesh yaa baahar nikalate samay, baithne par asana karte hue, or khud ko shuddh karnaa, haddees sahi bukhari ke anusaar, mohammad ne buree bhashaa se nafrat kii; na to fahish na hi mutafahish ko jagah di

com abul mujaffar muhiuddeen mohammad aurangzeb alamgir jise aamtaur par aurangzeb yaa alamgir ke naam se janaa jaataa tha bharat par rajya karne vaala chatha mogul shaasha tha
 His reign lasted from 1658 until his death in 1707
 aurangzeb ne bhartiya upmahadweep par aadhi sadi se bhi zyada samay tak rajya kiya
 He was the longest reigning Mughal ruler after Akbar
 apane jeevankaal main usne dakshini bharat main mogul samrajya kaa vistaar karne kaa bharsak prayaas kiya par uski mrityu ke pashchaat mogul samrajya sikudne laga
 The Mughal Empire reached the climax of its expansion under Aurangzeb's rule
 wo apane samay kaa shaayad sabase dhani or shaatishalee vyakti tha jisane apane jeevankaal main dakshin bharat main praapt vijayon ke jariye mogul samrajya ko saadhe baarah lakh varg mile main failaayaa or 15 karod logon par shashan kiya jo kii duniya kii aabaadi kaa 1 / 4 tha
 Aurangzeb imposed fatwa-e-alamgiri on the entire empire and also imposed an additional tax on non-muslims for some time
 gair-musalmaan janata par shariat lagu karne vaala wo pehla musalmaan shaasha tha
 During his reign, the Mughals had the highest number of Hindus among their court
 or sikhon ke guru teg bahadur ko darashikoh ke saath milakar baghaavat ke jurm main mrityudand diya gaya tha
 Aurangzeb was born on 3 November 1618 in Dahod, Gujarat
 wo shahjahan or mumtaz mahal kii chhathi santan or teesraa betaa tha
 His father was the Subedar of Gujarat at that time
 june 1626 main jab uske pita dwaara kiya gaya vidroh asafal ho gaya to aurangzeb or uske bhai daara shukoh ko unke dada jahangir ke lahore vaale darbar main nur jahaan dwaara bandhak bana kar rakhaa gaya
 Aurangzeb returned to live with his parents in Agra Fort on 26 February 1628 when Shah Jahan was proclaimed the Mughal Emperor
 yaheen par aurangzeb ne arabi or farsi kii aupchaarik shiksha praapt kii
 According to Mughal practices, Shah Jahan appointed Shahzada Aurangzeb as the Subedar of the Deccan in 1634
 aurangzeb kirki ko gaya jiskaa naam badalakar usne aurangabad kar diya
 In 1637 she married Rabia Durrani
 idhar shahjahan mogul darbar kaa kaamkaaj apane bete daara shikoh ko saunpane laga
 Aurangzeb's sister died in an accident in 1644
 aurangzeb is ghatana ke teen hafte baad agra aayaa jisase uske pita shahjahan ko usapar behad krodh aayaa
 He dismissed Aurangzeb from the rank of Subedar of Deccan
 aurangzeb 7 maheenon tak darbar nahin aa sakaa
 Later Shah Jahan made him the Subedar of Gujarat
 aurangzeb ne sucharu rup se shashan kiya or use iskaa sila bhi mila, use badakhshaan or balkh kshetra kaa soobedaar bana diya gaya
 After this he was also made governor of Multan and Sindh
 is dauraan wo faras ke safaviyon se qandahar par niyantran ke liye ladata rahaa par use haar ke alaava or kuch mila to wo tha- apane pita kii upeksha
 In 1652 he was rebuilt the Subedar of the Deccan
 usne golconda or bijapur ke khilaaf ladaaiyaan kii or nirnaayak kshan par shahjahan ne sena waapas bula lee
 This greatly hurt Aurangzeb as Shah Jahan was doing this at the behest of his brother Dara Shikoh
 san 1652 main shahjahan biimaar padaa or aisa lagane laga ki shahjahan kii maut aa jaaegi
 The power struggle started in Dara Shukoh, Shah Suja and Aurangzeb
 shah suza, jisane apane ko bengal kaa governor ghoshit karavaaya tha ko harkar burma ke arakaan kshetra janaa padaa or 1659 main aurangzeb ne shahjahan ko tajmahal main shahi khajaane ko karch karne ke zurm main najarband karne ke baad apane ko badshaah ghoshit karavaaya
 Dara Shikoh was hanged for treason
 aurangzeb ne kabhi bhi shahi khajaane ko swayan par karch nahin kiya
 The Mughals, especially since Akbar, had been lenient on non-muslims, but Aurangzeb was just the opposite
 aurangzeb ne jazia kar phir se aarambh karavaaya, jise akbar ne khatm kar diya tha
 He forced the Kashmiri Brahmins to accept Islam
 kashmiri brahmanon ne sikhon ke nauven guru teg bahadur se madad maangi
 When Tegh Bahadur opposed this, Aurangzeb hanged him
 is din ko sikh aaj bhi apane tyohaaron main yaad karte hai
 During the reign of Aurangzeb, there was a wave of war-rebellion-repression-climbing etc
 pashchim main sikhon kii sankhya or shakti main badhottaree ho rahi thi
 He eventually defeated Bijapur and Golconda in the south, but in the meantime Shivaji's Maratha army plagued him
 shivaji ko aurangzeb ne giraftaar kar to liya par shivaji or sambhaaji ke bhaag nikalne par uske liye behad fikr kaa sabab ban gaya
 After all, Shivaji Maharaja defeated Aurangzeb and Marathas in India increased their strength throughout the country even after Shivaji's death the Marathas harassed Aurangzeb
 is bich hinduon ko islam main parivartit karne kii niti ke kaaran rajput uske kilaaf ho gaye the or uske 1707 main marane ke turant baad unhone vidroh kar diya
 Aurangzeb's administration had more Hindus than other Mughal emperors and Shivaji was also involved
 mughal itihaas ke bare main yah ek sarvamaanya tathy he ki duusare baadshahon kii tulana main aurangzeb ke shasankaal main sabase zyada hindu prashasan kaa hissaa the
 Historical facts show that during the reign of Aurangzeb's father Shah Jahan, Hindus constituted 24 per cent of the various posts in the army, other important posts in the court and various geographical administrative units, which rose to 33 per cent during Aurangzeb's time
 em athar ali ke shabdon main kahen to yah tathy is dharna ke virodh main sabase tagada saboot he ki badshaah hindu manasabadaaron ke saath pakshpaat karata tha
 a large number of Rajputs were appointed to senior positions in Aurangzeb's army
 maratha or sikhon ke khilaaf aurangzeb ke hamale ko dharmik chashme se dekha jaataa he lekin yah nishkarsh nikaalte vakt is baat kii upeksha kar di jaati he ki tab yuddh kshetra main mughal sena kii kaman aksar rajput senapati ke haath main hoti thi
 Historian Yadunath Sarkar writes that at one time Shivaji himself was a mansabdar in Aurangzeb's army
 kaha jaataa he ki ve dakshin bharat main mughal sultanate ke pramukh banaae jane vaale the lekin unki sainya kushalta ko bhaanpane main naakaam rahe aurangzeb ne is niyukti ko manjuuri nahin di
 Aurangzeb lived a holy life
 apane vyaktigat jivan main vah ek adarsh vyakti tha
 He was completely free from all the enemies that were common among the kings of Asia
 vah yeti-jivan jeeta tha
 He was restrained in eating, drinking, dressing and all other amenities of life
 prashasan ke baari kaam main vyast rahete hue bhi vah apni jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye quran kii nakal karke or tapiyaan sikar kuch paisa kamaane kaa samay nikaal letaa tha
 Not only Aurangzeb, one thing is said about all the Muslim kings of medieval India that none of them were Indians
 vaise ek str par yah bachakaana or bematlab kaa tark he kyonki 17veen shatabdi ke bharat main raashtra jaisi avadharana kaa to kahin astitv hi nahin tha
 Even after this, however, this thing does not apply at least in the case of Aurangzeb
 yah mughal badshaah pakkaa ucchwargeey hindustani tha
 Its simple logic is that he was born in Dahod, Gujarat and was raised like children of upper-class Indian families
 puure mughalkaal main braj bhashaa or uske sahitya ko hameshaa sangrakshan mila tha or yah parampara aurangzeb ke shashan main bhi jari rahi
 Columbia University historian Alison Bush says that there was an atmosphere of encouragement to Braj in Aurangzeb's court
 badshaah ke bete ajam shah kii braj kavita main khaasi dilchaspee thi
 He patronized some big names of Braj literature such as Mahakavi Dev
 isi bhashaa ke ek or bade kavi vrund to aurangzeb ke prashasan main bhi niyukt the
 The official writing language of the court during the Mughal period was Persian, but before the rule of Aurangzeb, the language prevailing between the emperors and the courtiers had become hindi-urdu
 ise aurangzeb ke us patr se bhi samajha ja saktaa he jo usne apane 47 varshiya bete ajam shah ko likhaa tha
 The emperor had presented a fort to his son and ordered to be sung on the occasion
 ajam shah ko likhe patr main aurangzeb ne likhaa he ki jab vah baccha tha to use nagaadon kii aawaaj khub pasand thi or vah aksar kahata tha, ‘babaaji dhan-dhan!’ is udhaaharan se yah baat kahi ja sakati he ki aurangzeb kaa betaa tatkaaleen prachlit hindi main hi apane pita se baatcheet karata tha
 Emperor Aurangzeb acknowledged the importance of the religion of Islam, making the 'quran' the basis of his rule
 usne sikkon par kalma khudwana, nauroj kaa tyohaar manaanaa, bhaang kii kheti karnaa, gaanaa-bajaanaa aadi par roak laga di
 Banned the practice of sati in 1663 AD
 tirth kar punah lagaaya
 In 11 years of his rule, 'jharokha Darshan', in the 12th year, banned 'tuladan system', banned Hindu festivals in 1668 AD
 1699 i
 main usne hindu mandiron ko todane kaa aadesh diya
 'muhtasib' was appointed by Aurangzeb in large cities
 1669 i
 main aurangzeb ne banaras ke ‘vishwanath mandir’ evam mathura ke ‘keshav raay madingr’ ko tudwa diya
 He abolished about 80 taxes levied against the Sharia
 inhen main ‘aabwab’ naam se janaa jane vaala ‘raaydaari’ or ‘pandari’ naamak sthaneey kar bhi shaamil the
 Aurangzeb considered converting 'darul Herb' to 'darul Islam' as his important goal
 aurangzeb ke samay main braj main aane vaale tirth−yatriyon par baari kar lagaaya gaya jazia kar phir se lagaaya gaya or hinduon ko musalmaan banaaya gaya
 Aurangzeb's atrocities are mentioned in the compositions of poets of that time
 aurangzeb dwaara lagaaya gaya jajia kar us samay ke hisaab se tha
 Akbar abolished the Jaziya tax, but it was re-enacted during Aurangzeb
 jajia saamaanya karon se alag tha jo gaiyr muslimon ko chukaana padataa tha
 It had three levels and it was determined by the income of the person concerned
 is kar ke kuch apwaad bhi the
 The poor, unemployed and physically challenged people did not come under its purview
 inke alaava hinduon kii varna vyavastha main sabase upar aane vaale brahman or sarkari adhikari bhi isse baahar the
 Such was the religious tax zakat imposed on Muslims, which was necessary for every rich Muslim
 aadhunik mulyon ke mandandon par jajia nischitarup se ek pakshpaati kar vyavastha thi
 Modern nations cannot make such a distinction on the basis of religion and caste
 isiilie jab ham 17veen shatabdi kii vyavastha ko aadhunik rashtron ke paimaane par ise dekhte hai to yah bahut arajak vyavastha lag sakati he, lekin aurangzeb ke samay aisa nahin tha
 Other examples are also found in that period
 jaise maraathon ne dakshin ke ek bade hisse se mughalon ko bedakhal kar diya tha
 Their tax system was also biased at about the same level
 ve musalamaanon se jakaat vasuulate the or hindu aabaadi is tarah kii kisi bhi kar vyavastha se baahar thi
 Aurangzeb had built more temples than he had broken
 vishwaprasiddh itihaaskaar richard iton ke mutabik mughalkaal main mandiron ko dhahaana durlabh ghatana hua karti thi or jab bhi aisa hua to uske kaaran raajnneetik rahe
 According to Eaton, the same temples were demolished in which the rebels were given shelter or with the help of which a conspiracy was made against the emperor
 us samay mandir todane kaa koi dharmik uddeshy nahin tha
 Aurangzeb, notorious in this case, also followed the same rule of the Sultanate
 uske shasankaal main mandir dhahaane ke udhaaharan bahut hi durlabh hai or jo hai unki jad main raajnneetik kaaran hi rahe hai
 Aurangzeb, for example, never targeted temples in South India, while most of the army was stationed here during his reign
 uttar bharat main usne jarur kuch mandiron par hamale kiye jaise mathura kaa keshav raay mandir lekin iskaa kaaran dharmik nahin tha
 The Jats of Mathura revolted against the Sultanate, hence the attack
 thik iske ulat kaarnon se aurangzeb ne mandiron ko sangrakshan bhi diya
 This was his offering to Hindus who were loyal to the emperor
 kings college, landan kii itihaaskaar catherine butler to yahaan tak kahati hai ki aurangzeb ne jitne mandir tode, usase zyada banawaye the
 Scholars like Catherine Frank, m Athar Ali and Jalaluddin also point out that Aurangzeb had given grants to several Hindu temples, including the movable Bari Math in Banaras, Balaji Temple in Chitrakoot, Someshwar Nath Mahadev Temple in Allahabad and Umananda Temple in Guwahati
 Famous names are
 jis kalkhand yani mughalkaal main mandiron ko tode jane kii baat itani zyada prachlan main he, usamen hinduon dwaara kahin is baat kaa vishesh zikr nahin miltaa
 It can be argued that doing so in those times would not have been empty of danger, but even when the Sultanate came to an end in the 18th century, there is no mention of this
 ateet main mughal shaskaon dwaara hindu mandir tode jane kaa mudda bharat main 1980-90 ke dashak main garm hua 
 a big argument is also made in trying to prove Aurangzeb as fanatical that he had banned music, but this is also not true
 catherine bataati hai ki sultanate main to kya sangeet par uske darbar main bhi pratibandh nahin tha
 On the day the emperor took over the throne, every year there was a lot of dancing and singing in the festival
 kuch dhrupadon kii rachana main aurangzeb naam shaamil he jo bataata he ki uske shasankaal main sangeet ko sangrakshan hasil tha
 Some historical facts also point to the fact that he himself was well versed in music
 mirat-e-alam main bakhtawar khan ne likhaa he ki badshaah ko sangeet visharadon jaisaa gyaan tha
 Mughal scholar Fakirullah has recorded the names of Aurangzeb's favorite singers and instrumentalists in a document titled Raag Darpan
 aurangzeb ko apane beton main ajam shah bahut priy tha or itihaas bataata he ki shah apane pita ke jeevankaal main hi nipun sangeetkaar ban chukaa tha
 Talking about music flourishing during Aurangzeb's reign, Catherine writes, 'the highest commentary on music was written in Persian during the time of Aurangzeb, compared to the entire Mughal period of 500 years
 ’ haalanki yah baat sahi he ki apane jivan ke antim samay main aurangzeb zyada dharmik ho gaya tha or usne geet-sangeet se duuri bana lee thi
 But looking at the things we have mentioned above, it can be assumed that he never made his personal wish the official policy of the Sultanate
 aurangzeb ke antim samay main dakshin main maraathon kaa jor bahut bad gaya tha
 The imperial army was not getting success in suppressing them
 isliye san 1683 main aurangzeb swayan sena lekar dakshin gaya
 He stayed away from the capital, in the same campaign for the last 25 years of his reign
 50 varsh tak shashan karne ke baad uski mrityu dakshin ke ahmednagar main 3 march san 1707 i
 main ho gai
 He was buried in the compound of the tomb of Fakir Buruhanuddin in Daulatabad
 uski niti ne itane virdohi paidaa kar diye, jis kaaran mogul samrajya kaa ant hi ho gaya
