 Historians have referred to it as 'bab-e-deccan' and 'kalod-e-deccan', because after conquering this fort the gate of the south was opened, and the conqueror established the suzerainty over the entire Khandesh region
 Used to be is qile kii sthapana kab or kisne kii yah vishwaas se nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Historians have been forced to have a clear and correct opinion
 kuch itihaaskaar is qile kaa mahabharat ke vir yoddha guru dronacharya ke putr ashwatthama kii amartv kii gaatha se sambandhit karte hue unki puja sthali bataate hai
 There is a beautiful tunnel near the 'gupteshwar Mahadev Temple' of Burhanpur, which is as long as Asirgarh
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki, parvon ke din ashwatthama tapti nadi main snaan karne aate hai, or baad main 'gupteshwar' kii puja kar apane sthaan par laut jate hai
 Some historians attribute it to the Ramayana period
 prasiddh itihaaskaar 'mohammad kasim' ke kathananusaar iskaa 'aashaa ahir' naamak ek vyakti ne nirmaan karaayaa tha
 Asha Ahir had thousands of animals
 unki suraksha hetu aise hi surakshit sthaan kii aavashyaktaa thi
 It is said that he came to this place in the fifteenth century and built a wall of brick, lime and stones at this place
 is tarah aashaa ahir ke naam se yah qila aseergarh naam se prasiddh ho gaya
 Asirgarh had also been under the suzerainty of the kings of the Chauhan dynasty for some time, which is mentioned by historians of Rajputana in context
 kuch samay baad aseergarh qile kii prasiddhi dur-dur tak fail gai
 Naseer Khan Farooqui, son of Malik Khan, a soldier of Ferozeshah Tughlaq, was influenced by the fame of Asirgarh
 vah burhanpur aayaa
 He met Asha Ahir and requested that "my brothers and Balkana zamindars keep harassing me, and remain enemies of my life
" isliye aap meri sahaayta karen or mere parivaar ke logon ko is surakshit sthaan par rahane kii anumati den, to krupa hogi" aashaa ahir udaar vyakti tha, usne naseer khaan kii baat par vishwaas karke use qile main rahane kii ajna de di
 Naseer Khan first sent women and children in some bundles and in some sent armed soldiers armed with warriors
 aashaa ahir or uske putr swaagat ke liye aaye
 As soon as the doli entered the fort, Asha Ahir and her sons were attacked and were put to death
 is prakaar dekhte hi dekhte naseer khaan faaruqi kaa is qile par adhikaar ho gaya
 After the death of Adilshah Farooqui, the fort of Asirgarh came under Bahadur Shah's authority
 vah dur drushti vaala badshaah nahin tha
 He did not make any arrangement for the safety of himself and the fort, Emperor Akbar was distraught to establish his suzerainty over this fort upon hearing the fame of Asirgarh
 usne dakshin kii ore palaayan kiya
 As soon as Bahadur Shah Farooqi came to know about this, he made such a powerful arrangement in the fort for his protection, that even after being surrounded for ten years, there was no need for anything from outside
 samraat akbar ne aseergarh par akraman karana prarambh kar diya tha, evam qile ke saare raste band kar diye the
 He started firing at the fort with cannon night and day
 is prakaar yuddh kaa kram nirantar chalata rahaa, parantu akbar ko har baar asafalataa kaa hi munh dekhnaa padaa tha
 He consulted with his counselors, then it was decided to talk to Bahadur Shah
 sandeshvahak dwaara sandesh bheja gaya
 At the same time it was also assured that Bahadur Shah will not face any kind of heat
 bahadurshah ne samraat akbar kii baat par vishwaas kiya
 He came out of the fort to meet her
 bahadurshah faaruqi ne abhivadan kiya or tatpashchaat baat prarambh hui
 While the conversation was going on, a soldier attacked Bahadurshah from behind and wounded him and took him captive
 usne akbar se kaha "yah tumne mere saath vishwasghaat kiya" he
 To this Akbar said that "everything is justified in politics
" " phir akbar ne raajnneetik daanv-pench or chal-kapat se qile ke qiledaaron or sipaahiyon kaa sona, chaandi, heere, motiyon se moonh bhar diya
 These greed opened the gate of the fort
 akbar kii fuj qile main ghus gai
 Bahadur Shah's army could not stand in front of Akbar's army
 is tarah dekhte hi dekhte 17 janvari san 1601 i
 ko aseergarh ke qile par akbar ko vijay praapt ho gai or qile par mogul shashan kaa dhvaj fahraane laga
 Akbar's army took Bahadur Shah's sons captive
 akbar ne bahadurshah faaruqi ko gwalior ke qile main or uske putron ko anya kilon main rakhane ke liye bhijwa diya
 Just as the Farooqi emperor had obtained this fort by political tricks, cunningly, in the same way this fort was also going through his hands
 is prakaar aseergarh or burhanpur par mughalon kaa aadhipaty sthapit hone ke pashchaat faaruqi vansh kaa patan ho gaya
 Famous historian Farishta writes that, "emperor emperor like Akbar also had to use the 'key of gold' to acquire the Asirgarh Fort"
 akbar ke shasankaal ke pashchaat yah qila san 1760 i
 se san 1819 i
 tak maraathon ke adhikaar main rahaa
 After the fall of the Marathas, this fort came under the suzerainty of the British
 san 1904 i
 se yahan angrezi sena nivas karti thi
 The fort of Asirgarh is divided into three divisions
 upar kaa bhaag aseergarh, madhya bhaag kamargarh or nichalaa bhaag malaygarh kehalaata he
 Two routes have been made to reach this fort
 ek rasta purv disha main, jo ek saral seedhidaar rasta he, or doosraa rasta uttar disha main he, jo atyant kathin evam kshtdaayak he
 This route is for vehicles
 vaahan kii suraksha ke liye raste ke donon ore diwaar bana di gai he
 This route ends near a large moat
 jahaan ek bada phatak nazar aata he, jo 'madar darvaaze' ke naam se prasiddh he
 Seeing the height of the fort from below, it dares, that it will be difficult to climb to such a height, but the desire to see the fort, thrives the body and fills a new power and enthusiasm
 jaise- jaise ham upar kii ore chadhate jate hai, aas-paas kaa prakritik soundarya hriday ko aakarshith karata he
 In these beautiful scenes the person climbing the fort is so engrossed, that he does not even realize how high he has reached
 qile kii bhul-bhulaiya bharaa rasta dekhakar manushya aashcharyachakit ho jaataa hai
 Seeing this strange color of the fort, when you go further, the first gate of the fort is seen
 is darvaaze se kuch dur purv disha main lambi-lambi ghaas main chupe hue ganga-yamuna naam ke pani ke alag-alag do strot dikhaai dete hai, jinka pani atyant svachh or meetha hai yahan pani kahan se aata he, kisi ko nahin maaloom
 The staircase built in the water is clear, and the way ahead
 aage badhane par bhay kaa ahsaas hota he
 It seems that some secret route must have gone to some part of the fort
 is darvaaze ke saamne ek kaali chattan he, jis par akbar, danial, aurangzeb or shahjahan ke chaar shilaalekh farsi bhashaa main sthapit hai
 These inscriptions are inscribed with the names of the conquerors and subedars of the fort
 shahjahan ke shilaalekh se gyaat hota he ki, unke kaarykaal main yahan kuch imaarton kaa nirmaan karavaaya gaya tha
 The door which is near this chattan was built by Rajagopaladas, the governor of the fort
 yahan se khadey hokar dekhen to, aas-paas ke sundar drishy hriday ko aakarshith karte hai
 Small cannons were installed on the walls of the fort and on the gates with a small margin
 qile ke upari bhaag par pravesh karte hi saamne kii ore vishaal maidan he, jis par ghaas ugi hui dikhaai detii he
 At one time it was cultivated here, but now this vast plain is deserted
 aage badhane par aseergarh kii masjid kii do minaaren saafe dikhaai detii hai
 This is the 'jama Masjid' of Asirgarh
 yah masjid purnatah kaale pathar se nirmit he
 This magnificent mosque is a classic example of the construction art of the Farooqi regime and is memorable
 yah masjid burhanpur kii jama masjid se 5 varsh purv nirmit karwaai gai thi
 The length of this mosque is 935 feet and 40 feet in width

 uttari kone kii mehrab main burhanpur kii jama masijad ke shilaalekh kii tarah sanskrit kaa shilaalekh he
 From this, the year of construction of the mosque is known
 saamne ke stambh par samraat akbar ne ek shilaalekh farsi bhashaa main ankit karavaaya tha, jisamen aseergarh par vijay kaa varnan he
 This inscription was carved on the stone by the then famous accountant 'mohammad Masoom'
 masjid ke madhya bhaag main ek vargakar pathar kaa chabutara he, iske upar lohe kaa bada pech laga hua he
 It is said that there is a secret passage under this iron door, which goes outside the fort
 yah rasta itnaa chauda he ki, ghudsavaar saraltapurvak isamen se guzar saktaa he
 It is also told that, this underground secret road used to go to Burhanpur
 angrejon ne is raste ke bare main khoj kii, parantu asafal rahe
 There are two identical towers adjoining the hallway of the mosque, which are about 80 feet high
 in minaaron ke upree bhaag tak pahunchne ke liye sidhiyon kaa ghumaavdaar rasta bana he
 To the left of the mosque entrance is a well, whose water is sweet, cold and clean

 On coming down, there is a feeling that there is a huge floor house here
 masjid se nikalakar qile ke purvi uttari bhaag main saamne kii ore ek pracheen mandir he
 This temple is said to be the place of worship of Ashwatthama, the Mahabharata
 mandir ke baahar nandi virajman hai, or unke saamne shivlinga va murtiyan he
 In this temple too, a secret passage is told, which ends at the ganges-yamuna, some distance away from the first door outside the fort
 sambhav he ki shatru ke qile main pravesh kar jane par evam us par dhokhe se peeche kii taraf se akraman karne hetu yah gupt maarg banaaya gaya ho
 This temple still exists even after continuous natural phenomena occur
 vastav main yah qila manushya dwaara kiye gayi kaaryon kaa aashcharyachakit kar dene vaala adbhut karnama he, jo apana udhaaharan aap hi he
 Below Asirgarh is a village with a population of about one thousand, which is famous as Asirgarh
 solahavin shatabdi main yahan badanagar aabaad tha, or yah keval angoor kii kaasht ke liye mashhoor tha, jiske angoor 1870 i

 But today the eyes are longing to see the tenancy of these grapes

 There is also a small mosque of Farooqui period in the village Asirgarh
 masjid ke andar kii dakshini diwaar par ek shilaalekh laga he, jis par aayatein ankit hai
 In the past the mosque was fragmented
 shahar evam gram ke logon ne chanda ekatrit karke is ko punah banaaya he
 At a little distance west of the road here is a grand ancient temple of Shiva, built by black stone
 mandir aaj bhi acchhee sthiti main vidyaman he
 This Shiva temple is very ancient and is an excellent specimen of South Indian architecture

 san 1834 main farade ne vidyutarasayan se sambandhit apane kuch sankhyatmak prekshanon ko prakashit kiya
 These are called Faraday's laws of electrical decomposition
 iske antargat do niyam hai
 These rules are presented in different ways in textbooks and scientific literature, but the prevalent form is something like this- vidyut apghaton main vidyutagron par jamaa hue padaarth kii maatra dhara kii maatra samaanupati hoti he
 'quantity of current' means charge and not electric current
 'dhara kii maatra' samaan hone par vidyutagron par jamaa / hathaaye gayi padaarth kii maatra us tatv ke tulyanki bhaar ke samaanupati hoti he
 In a nutshell, Faraday's rules can be written as follows - jahaan Notice that m / z is the equivalent weight of the deposited material
 farade ke pratham niyam ke liye, M, F, tathaa z niyat hai ; at: q jitna adhik hoga, utana hi adhik m bhi hoga
 For Faraday's second law, Q, F, and z are constants; Thus, the higher the m / z, the greater the m

 The film's music and album composition A
R
 Javed Akhtar also composed the song with Rahman
 film kaa pradarshan 12 agast 2016 main vaishvik str par jari kiya gaya
 The film begins with Sarman and Hojo and their friends in 2016 BCE, when the young men of the ancient village of Amri get caught in a boat while traveling in their boat
 or unpar achaanak hi narbhakshi magaramachhon kaa hamalaa hota he
 Sarman fights his spear courageously and kills them
 phir unako dhokar gaanv vaapis lautate he jahaan unki nayak ke taur par jai-jayakaar hoti he
 Sarman does not sleep that night: when he loses his parents in childhood, he still feels the buzzing of his aunt's humming for several days, and when dreaming he finds a horny bizarre animal and mohenjo
 a glimpse of the vast city of Daro could be seen
 haalaanki uske chachaa kabhi bhi saraman ke mohenjo daaro jane ke faisle kii anumati nahin dete
 Eventually his uncle gives up, and advises that Mohenjo Daro is a very ruthless city and asks Sarman to take precaution on trusting anyone
 uske chachaa use ek ganda-taazib dete jo use sirf uske jinda rahane yaa mrityu ke vakt istemaal karne ko kehete hai
 With all the goods and furnishings, the business turns out as soon as Mohanjo reaches Daro, he is left staring at the vastness and splendor of the city
 yahaan ke bazaar macedonian or sumerian tathaa videshi vyapaariyon ke andekhi va anokhi saamaanon va pashuon kii bikri barabas aakarshith karti he
 Sarman learns that Mohenjo Daro's governance reins are in the hands of his chief dictator Maham and his evil son Munja
 maham kisaanon se atirikt kar ugaahi ek prastaav rakhtha he; is prastaav par nagar parishad ke ve sabhi saansad apana samarthan dete hai jo maham ke saathi he sivaay un khetihar kisaanon ke pratinidhiyon ke
 The election passes and when the representatives of the farmers expose the actions of Maham and threaten to ask - why Mahm is finally killed by the neighboring city of Harappa - Maham kills him immediately
 udhar saraman kii bhent chaani naamak sundar yuvati se hoti he, mohenjo daaro ke pramukh purohit kii beti or vah sirf 'ek ko hi' chunegi jo nagar ko mukti dilaayegaa or nai subah laaegaa
 In this way he leads a rebellion against this new tax of Mahm along with the peasants of Mohenjo Daro
 He makes a place in the elite class of the city due to his uncle's talisman, when he saves Chani from the rage of an angry horse
 Hai, then he meets his father, the head priest, recognizes him only after this meeting
 saraman or chaani logon ke saamne apane aapasi prem ko vyakt nahin kar pate lekin chaani ke ashru bayaan karte hai ki munja ke saath uskaa jabaran vivaah karaayaa ja rahaa he
 Sarman and Chani make love to each other during the dance held on the festival of New Moon and also that Sarman is the leader of the opponents
 maham fouran saraman ko mrityudand kii ghoshnaa karaata he par use ehsaas hota he use janata kaa samarthan praapt he to maham sajaa taal detaa he or behad kutilata se saraman ke samaksh bakar-zokhar khilne kii chunauti rakhata he
 The same proposal is made to Sarman that if he wins, he will free Chani from this engagement
 or vah ise manjuur karata he
 The chief priest meets Sarman in prison
 vah bataata he maham sumerianyon ke saath hadappa main shisham kii avaidh vyapaar ke kaaran hi tiraskaar kar diya gaya tha
 Like other merchants, Mahome entered Mohenjo Daro and was able to reach the city council due to this business
 vahiin maham ko mahaan sindhu nadi main vyapak sone kaa bhandar jamaa padaa he or tab maham ek badi yojana ke saath nadi main baandh banane kaa prastaav rakhata he tathaa sone kii khan ko doosraa rasta mil jaataa he or mohenjo daaro kii tijori main jamaa hone lagati he
 The wise and honest Pradhan named Shrujan opposes this plan but Maham somehow thwarts him and gets the dam constructed
 maham sona jamkhori ke jhuthe aarope main shrujan ko faansate hue giraftaar karaata he
 He regrets how he and Durjan used to get threats from Mahm if he helped the opponent Shrujan
 shrujan maaraa jaataa he
 The priest tells that Sarman is the son of Shrujan and that he will have to be freed from the tyranny of the evil Maham
 saraman kaa saamana tajik parvat ke croor aadamkhoron bakar or zokhar se ek bade ran akhaade main hota he
 In this long and heartless battle, he kills a man-eater but leaves the injured and the people of Mohenjo Daro run a wave of joy over his victory
 maham gusse main aag-babula hota he or munja se purohit va chaani kaa khaatmaa karne kahata he
 Munja impulsively reaches the holy temple and runs away towards Chani after killing the priest
 saraman chaani ko bachaata he or munja ko maar daalata he
 Sarman, leading the public, returns to the city council and challenges Mahm
 chaani maham se judi ek yojana kaa pardaafash karti he ki vah sindhu ke sone kii jamkhori kar khud abheer hone chalaa tha or pashchim se tambe or kaanse ke shastron kii taskari karata he
 On this support received by Sarman, all the heads of the city council give verdict against Maham
 janata bataur nae pradhan ke rup main saraman kaa chayan karti he lekin saraman kaa suzav rahata he ki mohenjo daaro ke logon ko sarkaar kii aavashyaktaa he naa kisi pradhan kii
 The dam built on the Indus River, gradually starts to crumble due to floods
 saraman ko ehsaas hota he ki baandh jald tutegaa or samooche nagar ko jalmagn kar daalega

 Equality before law is taken from the British constitution
 It is a negative right which denies the privileges of a person, this right is called rule of law, rule of law
 It means that the administration of the country is to run according to the law and not according to the wishes of the people, this rule is the highest law of regular law
 It establishes the lordship of law in the governance of the country
 yah desh kii sarkaar ko bhi vidhi se baandh detaa he, vidhi ke shashan ko diasi ne lokapriy banaaya tha 1 No person shall be physically-economically punished unless he violates the law
 2 This violation must be proved in the General Court
 3 All persons shall be governed by the general laws and courts of the country without distinction
 4 Constitution of the country
 This is the result of laws, this 4th rule is applicable in India 'the Constitution is the highest law of the country and is decided by the legislature
 All the laws will be valid only if the law is in conformity with the constitution
 The importance of rule of law is only after the rule of law is the law of the person, the law is the rule of the ruler
 Present indicates 3 paragraph 32, 226 establishes the rule of law
 There are three exceptions to the rule of law
 1 The President and the Governor shall not be liable before any court for acts related to the exercise of their powers
 2 No criminal judicial proceedings against the President and the Governor during his term of office
 Will not start, will continue 3 Any civil action against the President and the Governor will take him two months
 It cannot be started without giving advance notice
 Exceptions beyond the constitution, the visiting head of state, diplomatic staff will also be beyond the rule of law

 16 In special circumstances, residence can be considered as a special qualification for appointment
 Only Parliament can make laws related to the residence
 16 Any provision in this article provides reservation of posts for backward classes to the state
 Will not stop from doing it, but reservation is not a right to be obtained, it depends only on the will of the state This reservation is available in two cases only when the class which is to be given is socially and socially backward
 2 It is not adequately represented in public services
 According to the decision of Indira Sawhney vs
 Union of India 1992 The benefit of the service is only for admission in the service and not for the reservation given to 2 backward classes for promotion
 While he Rajyho the creamy identifying and them in OBC Reservation directs denial of benefits 4 There will be no reservation in the area of specialization and ultimate specialization 5 If there is only one post for appointment, then no reservation will be applicable
 Response to this decision of the government 1 Parliament passed 77th Amendment 1995 and established 16 which states Gives the right to give benefit of reservation in promotion to SC / JA 2 Tamil Nadu Backward Act 1994 which provides for service-educational no
 The place where 69% reservation has been given in the ninth schedule of the constitution has been passed

 Ambedkar, this is the most important article of the Constitution, without which the provision is meaningless, without this article, other fundamental rights cannot be considered real because this article gives the person his fundamental rights without this

 It has also appointed the duty of issuing the writ to the Supreme Court
 If the fundamental rights are proved to be violated in the Supreme Court, then they must compulsorily issue the writ and the rights will also be obtained in the hands of the judiciary

 a few years later, these fossil horses from the American Museum of Natural History assembled a famous exhibition of designs to show the gradual evolution from the "eoheippus" to the modern Equus

 In addition, the ankle joint was easily replaced
 miohippas bhi iske upree gaal daant par ek char shikha ko dikhaane ke liye shuru kar diya
 Seventeen million years ago, Myriahippus joined the horse line

 The brain was particularly large, smarter and more agile than the first horses Merryhippus is doing

 About 150 million years ago, in the Miocene era, Pylohippus, a three-toed horse was born

 Pylohippus was very similar and considered a direct ancestor of the Equus, except for two significant differences
 jabaki aikavs sab par koi chehre Fossae he sabase pehle, pilohippas' khopadi gahari chehre khaat he
 Second, the Pylohippus 'teeth are strongly curved but the equus' teeth are very straight

 thakur deshraj likhte hai ki maharaj surajmal ke chaar raniyaan thim
 From whom five sons were born to Jawahar Singh, Ratan Singh, Nawalsingh, Ranjitsingh and Nahar Singh
 kaha jaataa he jawaharsingh or ratansingh ek rajput rani se the, jiske soundarya se mugdh hokar surajmal ne uske saath shaadi kii thi
 Both Father Bendil and the author of Imadussat support that Jawahar Singh's mother was a Rajputani
 jat itihaas:thakur deshraj,prishthant-648 Maharaj Surajmal loved the heroic teenager queen, who had no children, among all her queens
 saubhaahgya se jawaharsingh ko rani kishori ne god le liya tha or isi ke prabhaav or pyaar ke kaaran vidroh-priy jawaharsingh apane pita ke krodh se batch gaya tha
 In the beginning, there was a great hatred for the Yavan rulers in the heart of the young man Jawahar Singh
 unhone dehali ke vajeer ko sirf is baat ke liye fatkaar diya tha ki usne unke haath chumkar apavitra kyon kar diya? maharaj surajmal kii ichha naharsingh ko apana uttaradhikari banane kii thi
 Nahar Singh was obedient to his father, respecting the gurus, was humble and simple-tempered
 kintu vah aavashyaktaa ke anusaar nirbhayata or veerta ke gunon se bharpoor na tha
 Jawahar Singh neither feared God nor man
 vah apane iraadon ko puraa karne tathaa badla lene main, donon manushya or ishwar kaa saamana karne ke liye taiyaar rahata tha
 He was capable of being a ruler right from birth due to being tactful, capable of management, agile, clever and brave
 kintu maharaj surajmal ko uski nirantar ladaaku pravriti hone se bhay tha ki bahut sambhav he jat-jati ko yah nasht kar de
 That is why he did not want to give them jat-shakti i
e
 his kingdom
 maharaj surajmal jitne mitavyayi the, jawaharsingh utane hi apavyayee
 This was the reason that they formed their own separate party
 alag darbar or sena rakhane lage, jiskaa ki kharch surajmal ko sweekaar kiye hue dhan se kahin adhik tha
 Maharaj Surajmal took great advantage of Jawahar Singh's impeccable bravery
 kathin se kathin morchon par unhen bheja gaya
 But their expenses had increased more than the income of the area of deeg
 saath hi jawaharsingh ko kuch aise saathi mili jinhone unako apane pita ke viruddh ubhaad diya
 Maharaj Suraj Mal wanted to punish his companions, so he mounted Deeg
 kintu jawaharsingh ne ise apana apmaan samajha or ve ladaai ke maidan main aa gaye
 In a short time his companions ran away, but he stayed in the field
 anek logon se bich main ghir jane ke kaaran vah jakhmi ho gaye
 Surajmal, who preferred to lose in the face of the death of his heroic son, rushed to the injured son and stabbed his beloved son by the chest
 tab se vah jawaharsingh ko bahut prem karne lage
 Keeping in mind his fighting spirit, Maharaj Surajmal considered that Jawahar Singh should be made the independent ruler of Haryana province
 yadi unka yah vichaar purna ho jaataa to maharaj jawaharsingh ko punjab kii ore se aane vaale aakrantaon se Jat History: Thakur Deshraj, pg-649 saadhan milte rahete, or phir bharat kaa rup hi doosraa hota
 Expansion of Bharatpur State - At the time when Maharaj Surajmal died, the expansion and splendor of Bharatpur State was as follows - Agra, Dhaulpur, Mainpuri, Hathras, Aligarh, Etah, Meerut, Rohtak, Farrukhnagar, Mewat, Rewari, Gurgaon and The districts of Mathura were under his authority

 Its length was close to 200 miles from east to west and 150 miles from north to south
 1 Father Bendill writes about the state of the financial condition of the state - ‘siyaar’ kaa lekhak likhata he - Maharaj Jawahar Singh sat on his father's throne on 2 January 1764 AD
 unako bharatpur ke maharaja hone main kuch kathinaaiyaan bhi uthaani padin
 Balaram, a great chieftain of Surajmal's army and jat itihaas:thakur deshraj,prishthant-650 Nahar Singh's maternal uncle, wanted Nahar Singh to be made the king of Bharatpur
 jawaharsingh us samay farrukhanagar main the
 He sent a message to his brothers that this is not the time to be a successor, but to avenge his father's death
 main apni thodi-si sena ko jo ki mere paas he lekar chadhaai karuunga or peeche dekhuunga ki pita kaa uttaradhikari koun he? is dhamkee se naharsingh to bharatpur ko chhodkar chalaa gaya or balram ne isamen budhimatta samajhi ki jawaharsingh kaa saathi ban jaae
 Jawahar Singh's position was weak
 vair main unka chachera bhai bahadursingh apni swatantra riyasat kaayam karne main lag rahaa tha
 There was no hope of any more cooperation from the Sardars
 phir bhi ve apane pita kii mrityu kaa badla lene ke liye najibuddaula par chadhaai karnaa chaahate the
 At the end of the month of October 1765, Maharaja Jawahar Singh went with a large army to avenge the death of Surajmal in front of the door of Dehli and destroy the Muslim influence of Panipat Vijay
 iske saath nijee 60 hajaar paidal or sau topein thim
 25,000 Marathas were called under the chairmanship of Holkar and around 25,000 Sikhs on salary
 prayek sipaahi ko ek rupaya roj diya jaataa tha
 Maharaj Jawahar Singh challenged Najibuddaula to come out and fight
 afgaanon ko baahar nikalne ko mauka dene ke liye apni sena ko 4-6 kos peeche ko hataa liya
 Najibuddaula set out with the Afghans
 jat bhukhe bhediye ke samaan afgaanon par tut pade
 They infiltrated the Afghans into the city
 maharaj jawaharsingh ne holkar tathaa duusare saradaaron ko saath lekar jamuna ko paar karke shahdare ko lut liya
 Najib Khan's forces left the grounds and entered the fort due to the Jats' artillery battle on 17 November
 ab kile or shahar par gola padana shuru hua
 For three months the Jats continued to plague the Afghans
 farvari san 1765 ko sabjimandi or pashuon kii paith ke sameep kii oonchi bhoomi par khadey hokar afgaanon ne sikh or jaaton par goliyon kii bauchhaar kii
 But the Jats, without caring about the bullets, entered into the Afghan contingent
 vivash hokar afgaanon ko phir bhaagna padaa
 While Jawahar Singh was just about to get a full victory, his pompous friend Malharrao Holkar turned his hopes on
 fadar vendal likhte hai- Jat History: Thakur Deshraj, p
 651 jawaharsingh is sandhi se prasann nahin the
 He returned to Deeg, believing Khunas from Malharrao
 phir bhi dehali kii ladaai main lut main unhen bahut se jawaharaat or keemtee saamaan haath lage the
 The gate named "ashta Dhati", which was taken by Muslim Emperor from Chittor to Dehli, is still in Bharatpur
 deeg ke sangemarmar kaa singhaasana bhi dilli kii lut kaa maujuud he
 Such things are still found in the countryside of Bharatpur, which he says 1 brought from the plunder of the sill
 jaaton main ‘dilliwaare kii lut’ naam kii ek kahawat bhi prachlit he
 After returning from the ascent of Dehli, they considered the urgent need to suppress their internal enemies
 unhen yah bhi sandeh ho gaya tha ki unki sena ke sardaar malharav holkar kii sajeesh main shaamil the
 He had a famous general named Samru
 maharaj ne uski adhyakshata main ek acchhee sena taiyaar kii
 After some time he went to Agra and arrested Balarama and others
 balram or ek duusare sardaar ne apane apmaan ke dar se aatmahatya kar lee
 Maharaj Jawahar Singh wanted that these people have the money collected dishonestly, that they should get it
 kaha jaataa tha ki mohanray sardaar ke paas nijee sampatti ko chhodkar 80 lakh rupee nakad the
 But till death, these chiefs did not tell Jawahar Singh anything
 maharaj jawaharsingh ne unako, jin par ki kuch bhi dhan hone kaa sandeh tha, atyant ksht diya
 Even after doing this, Maharaja Jawahar Singh did not get as much money as he had hoped, because those who knew the entire wealth, it was considered appropriate to die by informing him
 iske pashchaat jawaharsingh ke virodh main ek shakti bahadursingh kii bhi thi jisane maharaj surajmal kii sevaaon dwaara bahut-sa puraskaar bhi paaya tha
 It was the cousin of Jawahar Singh and of Vair jat itihaas:thakur deshraj,prishthant-652 Was the owner
 bahut se dhan ke saath hi yah ek acchhee sena bhi rakhata tha
 After the death of Maharaj Surajmal, Bahadur Singh became proud
 vah jat-rajya kaayam karne or us par shaasha hone kaa utana hi adhikaar samajhataa tha, jitna ki jawaharsingh
 His then practices showed that he wanted to live as an independent ruler over the plains of Ber
 vah jawaharsingh ke rokane par bhi baj na aayaa
 He started fortification
 jawaharsingh agast san 1765 main vair par chadh aaye or chaaron ore se gheraa daal diya
 Bahadur Singh had already made a lot of preparations, so he faced back
 teen maheene tak isi tarah akraman hote rahe or bahadursingh bekaar karata rahaa
 Eventually he was cleverly arrested
 jawaharsingh dwaara kaid hokar bahadursingh bharatpur laayaa gaya or navambar san 1765 main hi chod diya gaya
 Here Maharaj was engaged in the repression of Jawahar Singh Bahadur Singh and on the other hand Nahar Singh Jawahar Singh's younger brother was trying to take over Bharatpur while living in Dholpur
 vah yah acchhee tarah jaanata tha ki jawaharsingh bahadursingh se nipat kar teri or phiregaa
 Incidentally, Malharrao Holkar was also staying in the eyes of a Jat chieftain nearby
 naharsingh ne bharatpur par adhikaar kara dene ke liye usase likhaa-padhi shuru kii
 Malharrao had been in trouble with Jawahar Singh since his ascension of Dehli and was further infuriated when he refused to pay the remaining Rs 22 lakh to stop Holkar with a crime of treachery
 usne is avasar ko apni kasam nikaal lene ke liye kaaphi samajha ore atyant prasannataa se naharsingh kii sahaayta karnaa sweekaar kar liya
 He made him Dharmaputra and sent his army to Chambal as a defense of the son, who joined Nahar Singh's army and started protecting dholpur-durg
 is arase main jawaharsingh bhi chupchaap na baitha tha
 Total news reached him and he was preparing to attack in such a wise manner that Nahar Singh's assistant could also kill the Marathas on the way
 maharaj jawaharsingh ne sheeghra hi avasar dekhakar apane punjabi sainikon ke saath prasthaan kar diya or disambar san 1765 main chambal ke kinare pahunch gaya
 Here a part of the Maratha army, which had entered the Jat-territory, was arrested
 maharaj jawaharsingh ne jab dhaulpur par akraman kiya to naharsingh or maraathon kii sena usase loha na le saki or vijay-shri ne maharaj jawaharsingh kaa saath diya
 By taking over Dholpur, many Marathas there jat itihaas:thakur deshraj,prishthant-653 He was imprisoned
 naharsingh vahaan se bhaag niklaa or dhaulpur main ek chote se rajput jagirdaar ke kile main jaakar vishram kiya
 At the same time, he committed suicide by consuming poison and his family moved to Raja Jaipur
 jawaharsingh maharaj surajmal kii tarah namr vichaar kaa na tha
 He used to take the opportunity to destroy the enemy
 uski isi niti ke kaaran, uskaa apni sena kaa garvanar tak, uske paksh main na tha
 Maharaja Jawahar Singh, having taken control of Dholpur, saw that the Marathas had so much power, he began to desire to drive them out of the Rajputs
 parantu greeshm ritu aa jane se uske sikh sainikon ne asweekaar kar diya
 So at that time he postponed his intention
 parantu maharaj jawaharsingh ke iraade keval iraade hi na the
 The growing power of the time was dominated by Sikh soldiers
 isliye samast uttari bharat main surajmal ke jat-rajya kii daali hui neenv ko vah puraa or drudh kar lene ke vichaar main tha
 The Sikhs were enough to stand up against Abdali and here he was thinking of tricks for the Marathas
 malwa ke jaaton ko jat-sangh main milakar vah maraathon kaa ilaaj karne kii taiyaari kar rahaa tha
 Rana Chhatrasal of Gohad was fighting the Marathas with great valor and bravery
 punjab or bharatpur ke jaaton kii bhaanti vahaan ke jaaton ne bhi apane swatantra vichaar or mahan saahas kaa parichay diya
 Even in front of a large army of Marathas, he maintained his independent ideas and mission for years
 maharaj jawaharsingh ne veeravar rana chhatrashaal kii sahaayta kar maraathon kii shakti ksheen karne kii thaan lee
 When Madhorao Peshwa came to know of this tremendous jat-sangh, he was very scared
 kyonki vah jaanata tha ki isaki jad badi majboot he or vah he jawaharsingh, jisaki maar se marathe dhaulpur se kuch din pehle hi bhaag aae the or jinke samaacharon ko vah jaan chukaa tha
 He sent Raghunathrao with Holkar in the spring of 1766 to establish Marathas dominance with 60 thousand cavalry and one hundred big guns
 raghunatharav ne pehle hi gohad par gheraa daal diya or badi kadi-kadi maange pesh kin
 Jawahar Singh was very ill at this time, but soon after receiving health benefits, he went to war with the Marathas
 par jis durbhaagya se hamaare desh bhar ko kitni hi baar bhanyakar vipattiyaan sahani padi or desh is chintya-durdasha tak pahunch chukaa he, vahi durbhaagya vahaan bhi ad gaya
 Two wicked Jaichand stood up in Maharaj's party
 unhone thode se laalach Jat History: Thakur Deshraj, p
 654 par maharaj jawaharsingh ko usee ke camp main kaid kara dene kaa vaayada kiya
 The secret was revealed to the Maharaja by the spies at the right time to inform the secret of the disloyal Anupagiri Gosai
 unhone arddh raatri ke samay hi apni sena ko taiyaar kiya or ekadam se gostiyon ke camp par hamalaa kar diya
 The evil betrayer escaped with great difficulty, but his companions were imprisoned in large numbers
 unka camp lut liya
 In which around 1400 horses, 10 elephants, 100 cannons and other things came to the King
 is prakaar unhen unheen kii kerani kaa fal mil gaya
 At the same time, Abdali again stepped up and, like the Marathas, he also appeared again in Punjab in India
 abdali se saamana karne ke liye jawaharsingh or raghunatharav main ek sandhi hui-ek tarah se unhone jhagadon kaa faisla kiya
 We decided that we got to each other
 Those prisoners who are in Bharatpur should be released, 2
 If the Marathas fulfill the terms of the second treaty, then Jawahar Singh will give the outstanding dues of Malharrao, 3
 Raghunathrao, Maharaja Jawahar Singh's share of the Rajputana surrounding the kingdom
 Give Rs 5, xxrep 5 0 to the king on a yearly rent
 is prakaar ye sharten donon ore se hi saaf dil se nahin hui thim or na inhen nibhaane kii ichha hi thi, agar kisi aare waalon ko ise tod dene se laabh dikhalaai padataa
 By the middle of 1767, Abdali was not afraid of the Sikhs gaining strength
 us samay jawaharsingh chupchaap baitha na rahaa
 He stepped up for war in the rainy season
 ater or bhind jahaan ke raja maraathon ke adheen the, maharaj jawaharsingh pehle inhen kii ore badha
 He moved towards it much more than he had thought of himself
 usne apni shaktishaalee sena ke saath kalapi tak marathe or chote-chote anya jagiradaaron ko apane adhikaar main kar liya
 In this way, he increased the boundary of Jat-state a lot
 bharatvarsh main ek shakti is samay or pair jamaa rahi thi or vah thi angrej
 But the British were also looking for a friend who could help them
 chatur angrejon ne maharaj jawaharsingh ke paas 19 agast san 1765 i
 ko ek patr bheja, jisamen likhaa tha ki maharaj agar samaru naamak french ko apane yahaan se hataa den to angrej bahari akraman ke viruddh bharatpur kii sahaayta karenge
 But Maharaja did not pay any heed to this letter
 yahaan tak ki maharaj iske liye ekadam bhul gaye
 But the British were anxious to make a treaty with Maharaja Jawahar Singh
 ve baar-baar isaki cheshtaa kar rahe the
 Jawahar Singh saw that when the Marathas were praying for the treaty themselves, they would ask for the treaty jat itihaas:thakur deshraj,prishthant-655 Has been requested for, he soon joined the British against Abdali
 sandhi sharton ko eemaandaaree se paalane ke kaaran vah adhik angrejon kii taraf aakarshith hua
 Jawahar Singh also fulfilled his friendship completely
 angrejon se mitrataa hone par usne abdali se kisi tarah kaa sambandh na rakhaa or uske prarthana karne par bhi apane nishchay or pad par atal rahaa
 Similarly, the British broke friendship with the Marathas due to the British
 maharaj jawaharsingh ne is samay bhi jab bhi mauka mila, maraathon ke rajya par haath maaraa or unki udaseenta ke kaaran maraathon ke bahut se adhikrut pradesh par apana kabja kar liya
 When the Jats from around Dehli and Meerut heard that the Jat king Jawahar Singh had come to climb Dehli, they joined the army with sticks, ballams, whatever they felt
 isi tarah braj ke jat bhi unke saath sammilit hue the
 When he climbed the Malway, he also saw the condition and love of the Jats there
 ab unki ichha raajaputaane ke pashchim ore ke jaaton ko dekhne kii hui
 His kingdom had grown three sides, now it was the fourth direction which he had not paid attention to till now
 alvar ke rajya ke sansthaapak raja pratapsingh ne jawaharsingh ko udhar kii taraf badhane kaa adhik protsaahan diya
 Not only did he support, but prayed to him, because he came under the patronage of Maharaj Suraj Mal by quarreling with the jaipur-king
 isliye vah chahta tha ki jis rajya ne iske saath anyaay kiya he, uskaa badla le
 In fact, this was also the reason for the opposition of Bharatpur and Jaipur
 lekin baad main isi ke vishwasghaat se maharaj jawaharsingh ko bhanyakar haani uthaani padi thi
 The result of this loss also became very bad for Jawahar Singh
 maharaj ne jisaki bhalaai kii, usee ne dhokhaa diya
 It is right - "pyaan: panam bhujanganam only
 ” Bhartendu Jawahar Singh started an army-based journey for the purpose of Pushkar Snan
 pratapsingh bhi maharaj ke saath tha
 Basanti flags were hoisted in the hands of Jat soldiers
 jaipur naresh ke in jatviron kii yatra kaa samachar sun kaan khadey ho gaye
 He got scared
 haalanki jawaharsingh is samay kisi aise iraade main nahin gaye the, par yatra kii shahi dhang se
 The Jaipur King or any other did not tamper with him and he reached a certain place with the instruments
 snaan-dhyaan karne ke pashchaat bhi maharaj kuch din vahaan rahe
 He befriended King Vijay Singh
 idhar maharaj ke jate hi rajput saamanto main tufaan-sa much gaya
 Jats ruled there and this ruler Jat king with a view jat itihaas:thakur deshraj,prishthant-656 Began is kshudra vichaar ke utpann hote hi saamanton kaa santulan bighad gaya or ve jhund jaipur naresh ke paas pahunchakar unhen uksaane lage
 But the Jat soldiers whom they had seen going, did not have the courage to fight face to face, seeing their bravery and greater strength
 jawaharsingh ko apni bahadur kaum ke saath lagaav tha, uski yatra kaa ekmaatr uddeshy pushkar-snaan hi nahin tha, varan vahaan kii jat-janata kii haalat ko dekhnaa bhi tha
 He came to know that if a large number of Jats reside in Taurawati, they decided to return there
 rajputon ne lautate samay un par akraman karne kii puri taiyaari kar lee thi
 Even the destitute Pratap Singh who had gone to the shelter of Bharatpur Raj and had kept him safe and secure for many years, not only shelter, joined the conspiracy
 usne maharaj kii takat kaa sara bhed de diya
 The Rajputs waited for Maharaja Jawahar Singh to reach the narrow road, drain etc
 ve aisa avasar dekh rahe the ki jat vir ek-duusare se alag hokar do-teen bhaagon main dikhalaai paden tabhi un par akraman kar diya jaae
 On 14 December 1767, Maharaja Jawahar Singh passed through a narrow path and drain
 swabhaavatah hi aise sthaan par ek saath bahut kam sainik chal sakate hai
 In such a situation, Jats were going in a long queue
 saamaan vagairah do-teen mile aage nikal chukaa tha
 Rajputs, who did not fight face to face fear, attacked at this time
 vishwaas-ghaatak pratapsingh pehle hi maharaj jawaharsingh kaa saath chhodkar chal diya tha
 a fierce battle ensued
 jat veeron ne praanon kaa moh chhod diya or yuddh-bhoomi main shatruon par tut pade
 Jaipur King also filled Rajput chieftains in anger with insult
 jaipur ke jagirdaar rajputon ke 10 varsh ke balak ko chhodkar sabhi is yuddh main shaamil hue the
 All the chieftains fell on the Jat-soldiers on their way
 jat sainikon ne bhi ghir kar yuddh ke is aahnan ko sweekaar kiya or ghamaasan yuddh ched diya
 The infantry and artillery of the invaders ran at very low speeds
 jat-sainikon ne iskaa phayda uthaaya or ghati main ghuse
 At about mid-afternoon, both armies fought well
 is samay maharaj jawaharsingh ji kii ore se medic or samaru kii senaaon ne badi veerta or chaturaai se yuddh kiya
 The Jat soldiers defeated the Raja of Jaipur
 parantu jaaton kii ore se sena sangathit or sanchalit hokar yuddh-kshetra main upasthit na hone ke kaaran is ladaai me maharaj jawaharsingh ko safalataa nahin mili
 But he himself continued to battle till darkness, with extraordinary valor and zeal
 jat itihaas:thakur deshraj,prishthant-657 Dalel Singh, the commander-in-chief of the Jaipur Army, was killed along with his three generations
 yadhyapi is yuddh main maharaj ko vijay na mili or haani bhi bahut uthaani padi, parantu saath hi shatru kaa bhi kam nuksaan nahin hua
 It is said that almost all the vassals came in the war and 8-10 years old boys who were left behind, were left to run the dynasty
 isamen sandeh nahin ki maharaj jawaharsingh ko vahaan ke jaaton kii paristhiti or manovriti kaa bhi pataa chal gaya ki bahut din tak shasit rahane ke kaaran unka swabhimaan mar chukaa he
 Otherwise, what was the reason that when he went to climb further to Delhi? And the Jats of Meerut would come from every house with sticks on their shoulders and meet them and even if there was an attack on Maharaj here, they would not get lice on their ears
 maharaj jawaharsingh kii yatra shubh faldaayak na hui
 Now their mid-sun sets
 parivartansheel sansar kaa yahi niyam he ki yahaan hameshaa ek-si dhak nahin rahati
 This ambitious Jat chieftain also faced change
 uske shatruon ne jab suna ki jawaharsih ko jaipur vaale yuddh se haani hui he to unhone dekh liya ki ab mauka he
 On hearing this news, the region of Chambal region became a rebel and soon after it was found in the Jat-kingdom, it also left
 idhar madhusingh kaa bhi saahas bad gaya tha or baari haani uthaane ke kaaran badla lene ke liye 60 hajaar sena ke saath jat-rajya main ghus gaya
 The Nawab of Farrukhnagar agreed to help the Musabikhan Baloch and Ruhele Rajputs
 thik hi kaha he, ‘durdin pade rahim kahi, bhoolat sab pahichaan’ kii bhaanti sikh bhi maharaj kii mitrataa chhodane par utaaru hue or uske donon bahari praanton ko chhodana shuru kiya
 Madhusingh sent a royal order to go ahead and win the fort of Agra consisting of Musabikhan's army
 is samay prayek vyakti maharaj jawaharsingh ko rajputon se sulah karne kii salaah de rahaa tha, parantu swabhimani jat-sardaar ne gauravpurn samjhauta yuddh kii bich ladakar tay kar lenaa pasand kiya
 He began to prepare for war
 usne sikhon ko lut ke lobh ke badale 7 lakh rupee die
 M
 Madik's allowance increased by Rs 5000 to increase army
 jab rajputon ko bhay hua
 They were thinking that Jawahar Singh himself would propose the treaty, but now he saw that he had turned the Sikhs on his side, then he got scared
 unke sabhi iraadon par pani to phiraa, lene ke dene pad gaye
 He found it impossible to get out of the Jat kingdom safely
 aagat bhay kii ashanka se maharaj jawaharsingh se unhone sandhi kar lenaa hi apni raksha kaa ek Jat History: Thakur Deshraj, Page-658 maatr upaay sochaa
 The jat-king was negotiated after praying and he quickly returned to his place
 is tarah se rajput punjab ke bhayanak ghudsavaaron ke aane se pehle hi apane desh main pahunch gaye
 Ever since Jawahar Singh returned from Rajputana, he had not sat silent
 uske shatruon ne bhul kii thi ki vah saahasaheen ho gaya he, yadhyapi us samay uske shatruon ke ekadam khadey ho jane se use haani to bahut uthaani padi thi, par vah asthir na hua tha
 His nature was full of gallantry
 vah yah to jaanata hi na tha ki bhay kise kehete hai
 The desire to fight was full of strength
 bina ladaai uske liye jivan neeras tha
 After Madhausingh left, he saw that the opportunity to play this war-like game had come to an end, and with Madik traveled to a fort where a second dynasty of Rajputs ruled, took possession
 dedh maheene pashchaat vah kile par chadhane main samarth hua
 When his army became frightened by the shelling and ammo of the fort, it remained fearless
 duusari baar vah kile kii daraaj ke neeche se gaya or durg-rakshak darkar adheen ho gayi
 Maharaja Jawahar Singh was seated again with such determination and indomitable enthusiasm, knowing that the enemies were afraid
 atyant shighrata se maharaj ne bigadi hai paristhiti ko phir vaisaa hi bana liya
 His weapons started shining like before and the kingdom became rich with money and grain, which also got the love of the subjects
 usne apni sena kaa european dhang se sanghathan kiya, topakhane badhaaye jisase baahar vaale uski pratishtha karne lage
 His enemies were afraid that the volcano of his anger would not boil again
 parantu durbhaagya se hona kuch or hi tha jisase uske shatruon ke ghar main ghi ke chiraag jal gayi
 In June 1768, Jawahar Singh was killed with a deadly deception
 ‘brajendra-vansh bhaskar’ main us ghaatak kaa naam sujaat mev likhaa he
 The author of 'imad' writes that Maharaja Jabarsingh had taken out the tongue of a man only on offering ajna
 agre kii masjid ko bazaar kar diya tha or usamen anaaj kii dukaane khulavaa di thim
 No butcher could sell meat
 isse sambhaavna hoti he ki kisi tassubi musalmaan ne un par hamalaa karke maar daalaa hoga
 Suffice it to say for the death of Maharaja Jawahar Singh that the star of the Jats, the savior of Hinduism, who was still in great need, became extinct in the untimely
 unke nidhan se jat-samrajya kii gaadi to ruk gai Jat History: Thakur Deshraj, Page-659 par saath hi hindu-hiton ko bhi baari thes lagi
 1 vah yah dekh chuke the ki har maukey par, bharat main rahane vaale irani, toorani musalmaan tathaa biloch bahari akrantaon kaa saath dete the, desh ko phir se afgaanon kaa gulam banane kii yojana main lage the, yahaan ke kuch sufi sant fatwa jari karke abdali kaa samarthan kar rahe the
 Therefore, they were hated by this class
 jab maharaja surajmal shahdara ke paas dhokhe se maare gayi to maharani kishori ne maharaja jawaharsingh ko ek hi taane main yah kahkar ki "tum pagadi baandhe hue phirte ho, tumhaare pita kii pagadi shahdara ke jhaauon main ulti padi he", yuddh ke liye taiyaar kar diya 
 Maharaja Jawahar Singh was the first Hindu king to win the Vijay Vayanti by winning the Agra Fort and the Red Fort of Delhi
 dilli ke laal kile ke yuddh main jab kisi bhi tarah kila fatah na ho paa rahaa tha 
 Pakhariya's contribution to Jawahar Singh's Delhi victory is incredible
 jab jat sena dilli pahunchi or dilli ko fateh karne ke laal kile ke phatak kii kundi todna jaruri tha taaki sena kile main pravesh kar sake
 But when an elephant named Saffron struck 12 to break the gate of the Red Fort, but the gate could not break
 har baar hathi ke sir par phatak par lagi keele chubh jane se hathi ghayal ho gaya
 Seeing this, Maharaj Jawahar Singh said that the fort will be broken
 yuddh adh par main chhutegaa
 There was disappointment in the Jat army
 tabhi veerta dikhaane pushkarasingh aage aaye
 In this way, the gate was broken and the victory of Jats over Delhi, the body of Shaheed Pakharia was brought to the Khutail belt, Mansingh Ganga was cremated with state honors for his sacrifice and to make Delhi Victory a permanent place in the Red Fort
 The gates at which Pakharia gave his sacrifice were brought to Bharatpur, which are still kept in Bharatpur
