 It is also a member of the South Carolina Environmental Excellence Program and is also named in the Dow Jones Sustainability Group Index, which rated companies environmentally friendly
 bmadblu ne paryaavaran par company ke asar ko kam karne ke upaay kiye hai
 Along with making existing car models more efficient, it is trying to design less polluting cars, as well as working on environmentally friendly fuels for future vehicles
 electric power, hibrid power hydrogen ingine aadi kii bhi sambhaavnaaen isamen shaamil hai
 BMW is proposed to produce 49 models with the EU5 / 6 pollution emission standard and around 20 models emitting less than 140 g / km of CO2, which will be the lowest tax group and therefore in some European states as its future owners
 For this it will be like an eco-bonus

 The next best competitor's CO2 emissions level is 16g more than bmw's models, 28g more than the next competitor's BMW brand after this level - equivalent to a full one liter of diesel

 In the US, experts are of the opinion that the Beemer should only be used for BMW motorcycles and the Bimmer is used only to refer to BMW cars; This should be done in such a way that "true imitators" appear and avoid looking "identical"
 canada ke globe and mail Bimmer pasand karte hai or Beemer ko "uppi vidwesh" kehete hai, jabaki tacoma news tribune kaa kahana he ki yah antar "auto dambhiyon" dwaara banaaya gaya he
 "the use of the wrong slang bids BMW to risk offending fans

 When the larger 'X' Harraf was added to the series number, it was known as the BMW Sport Activity Vehicles featuring the BMW xdrive
 'Z' ko do siton vaale vaahan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In the 'M' version of 'Z' models, 'M' is added as a suffix or prefix, depending on which country it is to be sold
 
 In previous x and z vehicles, the engine displacement number is followed by 'i' or 'si'
 BMW is now setting standards for globally defined terminologies for its x and z vehicles, followed by two numbers followed by 'sdrive' or 'xdrive', which represents the engine of the vehicles

 Mithila was a kingdom in ancient India
 mana jaataa he ki yah vartmaan uttari bihar or nepal kii tarai kaa ilaaka he jise mithila ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 The folklore of Mithila has been going on for many centuries, which is known for its intellectual tradition outside India and India
 is kshetra kii pramukh bhashaa maithili he
 In Hindu religious texts, the first indication of this is found in Shatapatha Brahmin and explicit mention in Valmiki Ramayana
 mithila kaa ullekh mahabharat, ramayana, puraana tathaa jain evam buddha granthon main hua he
 According to mythological references, Mithila is the most ancient name of this region; Also it has been addressed by the name Videha
 tirbhukti naam praapt ullekhon ke anusaar apekshaakrit kaaphi baad kaa siddh hota he
 The most ancient connection of naming Videha and Mithila connects with Videha Mathava mentioned in Shatapatha Brahmana
 mithila ke basane ke aarambhik samay kaa sanket ukt katha main praapt hota he
 Videgh Mathava and his priest Gautam Rahugan walked east from the arrow of the river Saraswati
 unke aage-aage agni vaishwanar nadiyon kaa jal sukhaate hue chal rahe the
 Agni could not dry the Sadanira river and on being asked by Videgh Mathava where my residence is now, Agni replied that you live on the east side of this river
 shatapath brahman main spasht roopen ullikhit he ki pehle brahman log is nadi ko paar nahin karte the tathaa yahan kii bhoomi upjau nahin thi
 There was a lot of swamp in it because Agni Vishwanar did not taste it
 parantu ab yah bahut upjau he kyonki brahmanon ne yajna karke uskaa aswadan agni ko kara diya he
 It is also mentioned about the Gandaki river that in the later days of summer, that is, during the summer months, this river flows a lot
 is videgh shabd se videh kaa tathaa maathav shabd se mithila kaa sambandh prathit hota he
 In the Shatapath itself, the word Videha is also mentioned explicitly, referring to the Gandaki River
 vahaan kaha gaya he ki ab tak yah nadi kosal or vidah deshon ke bich kii seemaa he; tathaa is bhoomi ko maathav kii santan kaha gaya he
 In Valmiki Ramayana and various Puranas, the name Mithila has been associated with Mithi, son of King Nimi
 newnaadhik antaron ke saath in granthon main ek katha sarvatra praapt he ki nimi ke mrit sharir ke manthan se mithi kaa janm hua tha
 Valmiki Ramayana mentions the descendants of Mithi as Maithil, while in the mythological texts, it is clearly said that Mithila was settled by Mithi
 shabdaantaron se yah baat anek granthon main kahi gayi he ki swatah janm lene ke kaaran unka naam janak hua, videh pita se utpann hone ke kaaran ve vaideh kahalaaye tathaa manthan se utpann hone ke kaaran unka naam mithi hua
 Thus, the name of the state ruled by him has been considered Videha and Mithila
 mahabharat main pradesh kaa naam 'mithila' tathaa iske shaskaon ko 'videhavansheey' kaha gaya he
 Both Mithila and arrowheads have been called in the mithila-mahatmya of the Brihadvishnupurana
 mithi ke naam se mithila tathaa anek nadiyon ke tir par sthit hone se tiron main bhoga hone se tirbhukti naam maane gayi hai
 In this book, the position of the main 15 rivers in Mithila, situated between the Ganges and the Himalayas, has been considered and their names have also been counted
 mithila kaa mahatmaya batalaate hue vrihadvishnu puraana ke mithila-mahatmaya khand main kaha gaya he ki ganga se himalay ke bich 15 nadiyon se yukt param pavitra tirbhukti he
 This arrowhead is Mithila Sita's Nimikanan, the field of knowledge and the back of grace
 janaki ki yah janmabhumi mithila nishpapa or nirpeksha he
 It is pleasing to Rama and Mangaladayini
 prayag aadi tirth lokon main punya dene vaali he parantu ram kii prapti karwaane main samarth nahin he; parantu yah mithila sab prakaar se nishchit rup se ram ko tusht karne vaali hone se vishesh he
 Just as Saket is a form due to the city of the world, similarly Mithila is the cause of all bliss
 isliye maharshigan samast parigrahon ko chhodkar ram kii aradhana ke liye prayatnpurvak yaheen nivas karte hai
 Dev-powers like Srisavitri and Srigauri took this birth
 swayan sarveshvareshvari shrisita ji kii janmabhumi yah mithila ytnpurvak vaas karne se samast siddhiyon ko dene vaali he
 In the Mahabharata, the position of Mithila has been considered after Magadha
 shrikrishna, arjuna tathaa bhim kii magadh-yatra kaa varnan karte hue pehle sarayu nadi paar karke purvi koshal pradesh tathaa phir mahashon, gandki tathaa sadanira ko paar karke mithila main jane kaa ullekh hua he
 It is said that once again crossing the Ganges and the Mahashon to Magadha
 isse spasht prathit hota he ki us samay magadh ke uttar main mithila kii hi sthiti maani gayi he
 The kingdom of Vajji was included only under Mithila
 mahabharat ke is ullekh main bhi mithila ke seemaa kshetra ke bare main anyatra ullikhit pashchim main gandaki tathaa dakshin main ganga tak ke kshetra yathavat sanketit hote hai
 Mentioning the boundary of Mithila in the Brihadvishnupurana clearly states that- arthath purv main kosi se aarambh hokar pashchim main gandaki tak 24 yojan tathaa dakshin main ganga nadi se aarambh hokar uttar main himalay van tak 16 yojan mithila kaa vistaar he
 Mahakavi Chanda Jha has written the above mentioned verses as Maithili, while explaining the extent of Mithila
 is prakaar ullikhit seemaa ke antargat vartmaan main nepal ke tarai pradesh ke saath bihar rajya ke pashchimi champaran, purvi champaran, shivahar, sitamarhi, mujffarpur, vaishali, samastipur, begusarai, darbhanga, madhubani, supaul, madhepura, saharsa, or khagadiya jile kaa praayah puraa bhubhag tathaa bhagalpur jile kaa aanshik bhubhag aata he
 This range is according to ancient mentions, possibly due to the immense fame and uncontrolled spread of Kosi, the eastern border has been considered as Kosi
 band banane se purv kosi kaa koi niyat maarg nahin rahaa he
 Koshi is a book from all areas of eastern Bihar
 atah mahananda nadi se pashchim arthath pashchim bengal aarambh hone se pehle kaa puraa purvi bihar mithilanchal kaa hi swaabhaavik bhaag rahaa he
 The state of the 15 major rivers under Mithila, situated between the Ganges and the Himalayas, has been reported in the Vriddhivasupurana
 unke naam is prakaar hai:- These are the names of the relatively larger rivers then; But in addition to these, many small rivers in Mithilanchal flow continuously from ancient times till today and are making the name of 'mithila' arrowhead
 shriram-sita se sambandhit vishesh sthaan hone ke atirikt mithila devadhidev mahadev ke pujan-sthal ke rup main vishesh prasiddh rahi he
 According to the great Vishnupuran, the names of the major Shivalingas herein are as follows: - mithila parikrama ke kram main simavarti shivlingon kaa ullekh karte hue singheshwar mahadev tathaa kameshwar ling kaa naam atyadhik shraddha purvak liya gaya he
 Thus the names of the eleventh Shivlingas are enumerated here
 purv main singheshwar mahadev ko pranaam kar parikrama aarambh karne tathaa punah ghumkar singheshwar mahadev ke paas pahunchakar niyam-vidhi purna karke hi ghar jane kii baat kahi gayi he

 He proved through his experiments that due to lack of oxygen in our cells, they start respiration by fermentation and they turn into cancer cells

 Warburg had expressed the possibility that sulfurized proteins and an unknown fat are required to attract oxygen to cells, but they failed to detect this unknown fat

 She was a Chief Expert in the Fats and Drugs Department of the Federal Institute of Fats Research, Germany

 He was considered the greatest expert of fats and oils in the world
 unhone germany or angreji main ek darjan se zyada pustaken likhi or kai shodhpatr prakashit kiye the
 In 1951 Budwig first developed a paper chromatography technique to identify fats in live tissue

 is takanic se yah bhi sabit ho chukaa tha ki transfat se bharpoor hydroginated fat or margerine hamaare swasthya ke liye kitne ghaatak or jaanaleva hai
 This discovery also made it clear that the alpha-linolenic acid or ALA found in the mysterious and unknown fat linseed oil that attracted oxygen to cells
 Is what Warburg and many scientists have been looking for for decades
 yah sachmuch ek mahaan khoj thi
 He illuminated the whole world with the light of this knowledge
 is puri shodh main mukhya baat yah saamne ai ki linolenic acid tathaa sulfur-yukt protein kaa mishran cancer upachaar or achche swasthya ke liye pehali aavashyaktaa he
 So they decided to try new experiments
 unhone cancer ke rogiyon ko alsi kaa tel or paneer mila kar dena shuru kiya
 Three months later, their blood samples were taken

 a great discovery had taken place by Dr
 Budwiz
 cancer ke ilaaj main safalataa kii pehali pataakaa laharaai ja chuki tha
 Cancer patients looked energetic and healthy, their lumps had become smaller, they were defeating cancer
 unhone alsi ke tel or paneer ke jaadui or ascharyajanak prabhaav duniya ke saamne siddh kar diye the
 In this way, after years of research, Dr
 Budwig developed cancer treatment by mixing linseed oil, cheese, organic fruit and vegetable juices, exercise, sunlight etc
 is upachaar se unhone kai dashakon tak 2500 se bhi zyada cancer ke rogiyon upachaar kiya, jisamen unhen 90% safalataa milti thi
 Many leaders and members of the Nobel Prize Committee wanted to give him the Nobel Prize, but they feared that the $ 200 billion cancer business would not be overshadowed overnight due to the prevalence and recognition of this treatment
 isliye budwig ko kaha gaya ki aapako chemotherapy or radiotherapy ko bhi apane upachaar main shaamil karnaa hoga
 But he turned down the Nobel Prize for conditional not once but seven times
 ve kahati thi ki chimo or radiotherapy mere upachaar ke vipareet disha main kaary karti hai
 Seeing all this, expensive anti-cancer drugs and radiotherapy machines associated with the cancer business were getting sleepless
 unhen dar tha ki yadi yah upachaar prachlit hota he to unki davaaiyaan or chemotheripi kii mashine koun kharidega ? is kaaran sabhi bahurashtriya sansthaanon unke viruddh kai shadyantra rachane lage
 These people continued to force Dr

 Many judges slammed multinational companies and said that the research papers presented by Dr
 Budwig are correct, their experiments are based on scientific facts, the treatment developed by them is in the public interest and should reach the general public
 inhe vyarth pareshaan nahin kiya janaa chahie
 Otherwise, there will be earthquake in the medical world

 Therefore, he did not go to any extent to allow the treatment of Dr

 Comics in India have a long tradition associated with reading and its themes, where folklore and mythological stories have been transported in the form of child paintings since decades
 bhartiya comics bahutayat sankhya main desh main prakashit hoti he
 From the late 1980s to the 1990s, when the era of the comics industry was at the peak, many of the popular comics of the time sold over 500,000 lakh copies in a week, but with the passage of time, now only 50,000 thousand copies could be sold

 But even today, for the last three decades, Raj Comics, Tinkle and Amar Chitra Katha have made inroads across the country through their wide-ranging distribution network and are loved by their millions of readers in various languages

 Geometry is one of the oldest branches of knowledge
 jyamiti ganit kii vah shakha he jisamen binduon, rekhaon, vakron, samatalon ityadi kaa adhyayan hota he
 This science originated from land-related tasks, hence this mathematics is also called Bhumiti
 armbh main yah adhyayan rekhaon tathaa rekhaon se ghire kshetron ke gunon tak hi simit rahaa, jiske kaaran jyamiti kaa naam rekhganit bhi he The construction of Yajnavedis in India attracted the attention of mathematicians to the study of geometry, their study was more akin to field committee
 itihashyagyon kaa mat he ki bharatvasi isa se 1,000 varsh purv aise sambandh jaise 32 + 42 = 52 jaanate the, parantu aise hi katipay chhutput samikarnon ke atirikt unhone aise sambandhon kaa kisi vyapak rup se adhyayan nahin kiya
 About 600 years before Christ, the Roman mathematician Pithgauras studied this relationship in a logical manner and stated that the square on the hypotenuse in a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares above the other arms
 vaise to jyamiti kaa adhyayan sabhi puraane sabhy deshon, jaise misr, babilonia, china, bharat tathaa yunaan, main lagbhag saath hi saath aarambh hua, parantu jitani unnati is vigyaan main yunaan ne kii utani kisi or desh ne nahin kii
 About 300 years before Christ, Euclid, a mathematician from Greece, sorted all the facts that were known by that time in a very logical manner
 gyaat tathyon ke aadhaar par usne anya tathy siddh karne kaa praytn kiya
 In this way, on sorting the facts, he reached some preliminary facts which are difficult to prove
 vaise ve bilkul spasht prathit hote hai
 These facts are so simple that Euclid accepted them as axiomatic and called them facts themselves
 inhen tathyon par jyamiti ke pramayon kaa pramaan nirbhar he
 Those facts are the following: 1
 ve vastuen, jo ek hi vastu ke baraabar hon, aapas main bhi baraabar hoti hai
 2
 If equal items are added to equal items then the sum is equal
 3
 yadi baraabar vastuon main se baraabar vastuen gata di jaayan to sheshfal baraabar hote hai
 4
 Equals equal to equal objects
 5

 Similarly in creation, you can also create from one composition to another, but in the end we reach some such compositions, whose use does not depend on other experiments
 in rachanaaon ko bhi swayan prayog maanakar hi aage bad sakate hai
 They inke atirikt ve koi or tathy bina siddh kiye hue sweekaar nahin karte
 Four of the above five facts themselves are so simple and clear that proving them is equivalent to proving your hand, but the fifth does not seem to be axiomatic

 These efforts resulted in great inventions
 isi prakaar jyamiti main nae nae paribhaashik shabdon kaa ullekh hota he
 The definition of one word depends on the definition of other words
 ant main dekhte hai ki ye paribhaashaayen bindu, rekha or tal kii paribhaashaon par aadhaarit hai
 According to Euclid, the plane is one in which the length is the width, but the thickness is not
 bahut se log is paribhaasha par bhi andeh karne lage hai, parantu thodaa manan karne se yah spasht ho jayega ki paribhaasha thik he
 For example, if two liquids are filled in a glass vessel that do not meet each other, then when they become stable then we will see that one plane separates the two substances
 usamen motaai nahin he
 If it were, there would be a space between the two fluids that neither contained the substance below nor the top, but it is impossible
 is udhaaharan se spasht ho gaya hoga ki tal main motaai nahin hoti
 It only has length and width
 isi prakaar dhoop main kisi samtal diwaar kii chaaya dekhakar ham kah sakate hai ki rekha main chaudaai nahin hoti
 The line is located in the plane, so the thickness of the floor is the thickness of the line
 isaliye rekha main na motaai hoti he na chaudaai, keval lambaai hi hoti he
 If the lines meet at a point, then the width of the line is the length of the point, that is, there is neither length, nor width, thickness in the point
 keval sthaan hi hota he
 Everyone will be aware that in geometry, the properties of triangles, squares, circles, cones, cylinders, etc
, are studied
 un prashnon ke halon ne bahut vichaarvardhan kiya, isamen koi shankaa nahin, jaise aisa ghan bananaa jiskaa ghanfal die ghan kaa duguna ho
 At that time, the meaning of composition was understood to be composed with the help of tracks and compasses
 doosraa prashn tha aisa varg bananaa jiskaa kshetrafal die hue vrutt ke kshetrafal ke baraabar ho
 The third question was to divide a given angle into three equal parts
 yah kaam patari or parkaar se asambhav he, parantu anya upayon se ho saktaa he
 These questions kept mathematicians busy for centuries
 inke vivechan se ganitjgat kaa bahut laabh pahunchaa, isamen koi andeh nahin
 The Greeks also studied the properties of the ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola curve formed by cutting a cone from a plane
 in adhyayanon ne capalan ko apane niyam gyaat karne main badi sahaayta di hogi
 Until the 15th century, geometry was often the study of measurement properties, but after that, properties were also studied which do not depend on measurement; For example, if the vertices of two triangles are on a three pointed line, the corresponding sides meet on a line

 In the middle of the 17th century, the French mathematician Decart made it very powerful by using algebra in geometry
 usne pehle do katati hui rekhaayen leen, jinhen aksh kehete hai
 The distance measured in parallel to these lines of a point is determined by its number or two
 ye rekhaayen bindu ke nirdeshaank kehalaati hai
 With the help of these coordinates each geometric fact can be represented by an algebraic equation
 is jyamiti kaa kai dishaao main vikaas hua
 In the first case, a broader form of geometry emerged, such that the equation of an exponent represents a simple line
 isi prakaar do ghaat kaa sameekaran ek shankav pradarshit karata he
 Similarly, the equations of powers three, four and higher began to be studied and the properties of their corresponding curves became much simpler than before
 tal ke vakron tak hi nahin, avkaash ke vakron kaa bhi adhyayan sambhav ho gaya
 For this, the points of a point from a three-point plane are determined by its distance and represent each point along an equation in Y, R, L
 in samikarnon ke vivechan se talon ore vakron ke gunon kaa adhyayan saralata se hota he
 In the other direction, the solution of composition related questions and activities became very simple
 ye kriyaayein keval kuch samikarnon ke hal par hi nirbhar hai, jisamen bahut vyapak prashn saralata se hal ho jate hai; jaise yadi rekha kisi vakr = o ko katati he, to in donon samikarnon ke hal unke kataan binduon kaa sthaan nishchit karenge
 If the origin of these equations is real, the line cuts the curve
 yadi baraabar hai to rekha vakr ko sparsh karti he
 If imaginary, the line does not intersect the curve, but we can say that the line will always cut the curve at two points, whether the points are real or coincident, or imaginary
 isi prakaar se tathy bade vyapak rup main die ja sakate hai, jo saadhaaran jyamiti main sambhav nahin tha
 In the third direction, coordinate geometry broadened the dimension
 do sankhyaayein ya, r do vimitiyon main tathaa teen sankhyaayein teen vimitiyon main kisi bindu kaa sthaan nishchit karti hai
 Now, the question arose in front of mathematicians as to what the four numbers Y, R, L, and the five numbers Y, R, L, V, would represent
 ganitagyon ne to amoort rup se apane mastishk main badi aasaani se soch liya ki chaar sankhyaayein chaar vimitiyon main or paanch sankhyaayein paanch vimitiyon main kisi bindu kaa sthaan nishchit karengi
 In this way, he also thought well of the anomalies
 unhen isse koi matlab nahin ki parthiv jagat main uskaa koi udhaaharan he yaa nahin
 Einstein must have used this idea in his theory of relativity and clarified the idea of aversion
 ab is ucch vimiti ke vichaar kaa aprayukt ganit main kuch kathin samasyaon ko hal karne main upyog karte hai
 For example, the number of different particles in a moving fluid is represented by seven numbers
 ve hai k, kha, ga, uskaa praarambhik sthaan, tathaa teen veg, jo ya, r, l aksh ke samaantar hon, tathaa samay, yah saat vimiti kaa prashn samajhakar hal ho saktaa he
 In the fourth direction, coordinate geometry generalized numbers and imaginary numbers emerged
 kalpanik bindu tathaa kaalpanik vakr ityadi vichaaron ne jyamiti ko bahut mahatvashaalee bana diya, jisase vyapkikaran main or adhik sahaayta mili, jaise anant par do kaalpanik binduon se janevaala shaankab vrutt hota he, ityadi
 In addition, geometry was discussed with the help of different types of coordinates, such as quadratic coordinates, triangular coordinates, tangent coordinates, etc
 nirdeshaankon ke prayog ke lagbhag 50 varsh baad hi kalan kaa prayog bhi jyamiti main hone laga

 Through the senses, we get the knowledge of external subjects - form, taste, smell, touch and words, and inert matters - good sorrow, sorrow etc
 idriyon ke abhaav main ham vishyon kaa gyaan kisi prakaar praapt nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, according to the rationale, the sense is the theorem that is combined with body, imperceptible and knowledge
 nyaay ke anusaar indriyaan do prakaar kii hoti hai : Bahirindriya - olfactory, nasal, eye, skin and uterus and antarindriya - keval man 
 In these, external senses are achieved by smell, juice, form touch and word respectively
 sukh du:kha aadi bhitari vishay hai
 Their achievement is through the mind
 man hriday ke bheetar rahanevaala tathaa anu parmaanu se yukt mana jaataa he
 Realization of the power of the senses is by inference, not directly, but according to the Sankhya, the senses are considered to be the number of eleven in which the gnanendris and the karmendrias are considered to be five
 gyanendriyaan purvokt paanch hai, karmendriyaan mukh, haath, pair, maladwar tathaa jananendriya hai jo kramash: bolne, grahan karne, chalane, mel tyaagane tathaa santanotpaadan kaa kaary karti he
 The conceptual mind is considered to be the eleventh sense
 chhathi indriya kaise jagaaye It is said that there are five senses - eye, nose, tongue, ear and sex
 isi ko drishy, sugandh, swaad, shravan or sparsh kaha jaataa he
 But there is another sixth sense which is not visible, but its existence is felt
 vah man kaa centrebindu bhi ho saktaa he yaa bhrikuti ke madhya sthit ajna chakra jahaan sushunma naadee sthit he
 Many stories of Sixth Sense are filled in books
 is gyaan par kai tarah kii filmein bhi ban chuki hai or upanyaaskaaron ne is par upanyaas bhi likhe hai
 There used to be many people who had knowledge of sixth sense in ancient or medieval period, but today, if they are not seen anywhere, then there are many reasons for this
 mesmerism yaa hypnoticem jaisi anek vidyaayein is chhathi indri ke jaagrath hone kaa hi kamaal hota he
 We want to tell you what a sixth sense is and how its power can be achieved by yoga and also how we can use it in life
 kya he chhathi indri : mastishk ke bheetar kapaal ke neeche ek chhidr he, use brahmarandhra kehete hai, vahiin se sushunma ridh se hoti hui muladhar tak gai he
 Sushunma Nadi is associated with Sahasrakara
 ida naadee sharir ke baayin taraf sthit he tathaa pingala naadee daayin taraf arthath ida naadee main chandra swar or pingala naadee main surya swar sthit rahata he
 The sushumna is located in the middle, so when both of our vowels move, it is believed that the sushumna pulse is active
 is sakriyata se hi siksth sens jaagrath hota he
 Apart from Eda, Pingala and Sushunma, there are thousands of nadis in the whole body
 ukt sabhi naadiyon kaa shuddhi or shashaktikaran sirf pranayam or asana se hi hota he
 Only after purification and empowerment can the power of the said pulse be awakened
 chhathi indri ke jaagrath hone se kya hoga : vyakti main bhavishya main jhaankane kii kshamta kaa vikaas hota he
 The truth of the incident can be ascertained by going into the past
 milon dur baithe vyakti kii baaten sun sakate hai
 The idea of what is going on in your mind is revealed literally
 ek hi jagah baithe hue duniya kii kisi bhi jagah kii jaankaree pal main hi hasil kii ja sakati he
 Nothing can be hidden from the sixth person and the possibilities of developing its capabilities are endless
 kaise jaagrath karen chhathi indri : yah indri sabhi main suptavastha main hoti he
 By continuously and regularly meditating between the Bhrkuti, the obedient cycle starts awakening which increases our Sixth Sense
 yoga main tratak or dhyaan kii kai vidhiyaan bataai gai hai
 You can practice it by choosing any one of them
 shant-svachh vaataavaran : abhyaas ke liye sarvapratham jaruri he saaf or svachh vaataavaran, jahaan fefdon main taaji hawa bhari ja sake anyathaa aage nahin badha ja saktaa
 The environment of the city is not beneficial, because in addition to noise, dust, smoke, toxic substances and carbon doxite continue to erode your body and mind
 pranayam kaa abhyaas : vaigyanik kehete hai ki dimag kaa sirf 15 se 20 pratishat hissaa hi kaam karata he
 We do not take nutrients that can benefit the brain, then pranayama is the only remedy left
 iske liye sarvapratham jaagrath karnaa chahie samast vayukoshon ko
 Due to inhalation of air not reaching millions of lungs and heart air sacs, they remain silent
 unka koi upyog nahin ho paata
 By getting pranayama up to the said air sacs, the cells' power to fight diseases increases, new blood is formed and all the nadis start coming into action
 chote-chote nae tishyu banane lagate hai
 Due to them, skin and skin start to improve and freshen up
 maun dhyaan :bhrikuti par dhyaan lagaakar nirantar madhya sthit andhere ko dekhte rahen or yah bhi jaanate rahen ki shwaas andar or baahar ho rahi he
 Silent meditation and meditation only strengthens the mind and body, the dark one in the middle is changed from black to blue and blue to white
 sabhi ke saath alag-alag paristhitiyaan nirmit ho sakati hai
 Silence increases the capacity of the mind, which increases imaginary power and ability to perceive
 isi ke madhyam se purvabhaas or saath hi isse bhavishya ke garbh main jhaankane kii kshamta bhi badhati he
 This is the beginning of development of Sixth Sense
 antat: hamaare peeche koi chal rahaa he yaa daravaaje par koi khadaa he, is baat kaa hamen abhas hota he
 This ability to be perceived is the information of our sixth sense
 jab yah abhas hone kii kshamta badhati he to purvabhaas main badal jaati he
 The stability of the mind and its power are helpful in the development of the sixth sense

 The probability of occurrence of an event is called probability or probability
 sankhyikee, ganit, vigyaan, darshanashastra aadi kshetron main iskaa bahutayat se prayog hota he
 Probability is generally related to an event that is more likely to occur than not
 is arth main yah shakya se bhinn he
 The event is possible when there is no resistance to its occurrence
 'rvadhya mata' kaa hona na to shakya he or na sambhavya hi
 The 'golden Mountain' is not possible, but it is possible
 vaigyanik arth main sambhavyata kaa sambandh us ghatana se he jo na to nishchit he or na asambhav
 If the symbol of definite knowledge is to be considered as 'one' and 'zero' for lack of definite knowledge, then the place of probability can be determined between these '0' and '1'
 sambhavyata ke aadhaar hote hai
 Zevons considers the basis of probability subjective
 unhone vishwaas ko sambhavyata kaa aadhaar mana he
 This view is said to be faulty, because probability is related to quantity and it is not possible to express confidence in quantity
 vishwaas ko sambhavyata kaa aadhaar maananaa isliye bhi uchit nahin janchataa kyonki sambhavyata kii gananaa hoti he or yah gananaa vishwaas ke saath sambhav nahin he
 That is because the belief in something is never experienced and sometimes the trust of two people becomes different on one experience
 sambhavyata kaa sambandh aagaman se he
 Arrival is based on inspection and testing
 at: sambhavyata ko purna rup se aatmagat kahana uchit nahin, kyonki nirikshan or pareekshan vishaygat he
 Due to these above errors, some thinkers have certified the possibility as thematic
 sambhavyata anubhav par nirbhar karti he
 Experience is thematic
 anubhav ke aadhaar par hi ghatana ke hone yaa na hone main hamaara vishwaas hota he
 This belief is subjective
 at: nishkarsh yah nikalataa he ki sambhavyata kaa aadhaar anubhav or vishwaas donon hi hai
 Probability is calculated by mathematics
 ghatnaayen vibhinn prakaar kii hoti hai
 Therefore, the method of calculating their probability is also different
 saral ghatana kii sambhaavna nikaalane ke liye ghatana ghatit hone kii sambhaavna kii sankhya main ghatana ke hone kii sambhaavna ko sampurna sankhya se bhaag dete hai
 This time the rule is to know the possibility of the king of black betel by pulling in 52 cards of cards
 at: kaala paan kaa badshaah nikalne kii sambhaavna 1 / 52 he
 Two events that do not happen together have to add their different probability to calculate the probability of an event occurring
 taash kii 52 pattiyon main gulam or badshaah kisi ek ke nikalne kii sambhaavna he : Similarly, the probability of two independent events occurring simultaneously by multiplying their different probabilities together
 indradhanush tathaa varsha, in donon swatantra ghatnaon ke saath saath ghatit hone kii sambhaavna hogi : The same rule is also applicable with the subordinate events
 ekatrit kiye hue pramaan kii satyata kii sambhaavna ko jaanane ke liye 1 main se uski asambhaavnaaon ke gunanfal ko gata dete hai
 The probability of an event told by other witnesses to be true can be deduced as: When a testimony is 5 / 6 the probability of being true will be unlikely to be true
 phir duusari gavaahi main satya hone kii sambhaavna jab 2 / 3 he to usamen asambhaavna hogi By subtracting the product of these two different possibilities, the answer will be - is prakaar gavaahon dwaara bataai hui ghatana ke satya hone kii sambhaavna 17 / 18 hogi
 Thus the quantity of probability is calculated on the basis of number
 at: sankhya kii gananaa purna rup se nahin hone par sambhavyata kii maatra nishchit nahin kii ja sakati
 The conclusion that is obtained after calculating the probability is true only for the average
 duusare shabdon main yah kahen ki sambhavyata ausat ke liye satya hoti he
