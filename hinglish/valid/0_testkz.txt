 Chemical synapse is the expert confluence through which a neuron signals to one another and to non-neuronal cells such as muscles or glands
 rasinic antargrathan neurons ko kendriya tantrika tantra main circuit form karne kii anumati dete he
 These are important for biological computation maintaining perception and thought
 ye tantrika tantra ko anya pranaaliyon se judane or niyantran karne kii anumati dete hai
 In a chemical synapse, one neuron releases a neurotransmitter in small intervals, which is adjacent to another neuron
 neurotransmeter ko antargrathan se kushaltapurvak baahar saaf kiya janaa chahie taaki antargrathan phir se jald se jald kaary ke liye taiyaar ho saken
 The adult human brain is completely divisible by an estimated 1014 to 5 * 1014
 har pramastishk praantastha main mote taur par ek arab ghan millimetre hota he The word "synapsi" comes from "synaptine", which was coined by Sir Charles Scott Sherrington and his colleagues from the Greek words "SYN-" and "haptein"
 rasinic antargrathan, jaivik antargrathan kaa ekmaatr prakaar nahin he: electrical or immunological bhi maujuud hai
 Without a diacritic, "synapse" generally means chemical synapse

 a typical neuron produces several thousand synapses, although many types do very little
 adhikansh antargrathan akshatantu ko kedrumika se conect karte hai, lekin kai anya prakaar conection bhi uplabdh hai, jisamen akshatantu se koshikeey sharir, akshatantu se akshatantu or drumika-se-drumika shaamil hai
 Synapse is usually too small to be detected, it can only be seen with a microscope at the point where the membranes of two cells touch each other, but their cellular elements are clearly seen by the electron microscope

 Aa action potential) The tail current depends on the ion channel's postsynaptic current display, which in turn is a function of the type of receptors and neurotransmitter employed in synapses

 antargrathni sancharan desensitization jaise, homoanwargrawani plasticity or heteroanwargrawani plasticity ke dwaara modulated ja saktaa he: Homo synaptic is a change in synaptic strength that results in a particular synapse from the history of activity
 is sanket par prisaneptic rup se parinaam kar sakate hai calcium or saath hi raay prisaneptic parivartan main receptors autocrine farm kii ek, arthath
 homoanwargrawani plasticity sankhya ko prabhavit or puticaoos kii punahpurti dar saktaa he yaa yah calcium or putica rihaai ke bich ke rishte ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
 Homo synaptic plasticity can also be post-synaptic in nature
 yah yaa to ek badhaane yaa antargrathni shakti main kami ho sakati he
 An example is SNS, which releases noradrenaline, which affects postsynaptic receptors but also affects noradrenaline presynaptic α2 -adrenergic receptors inhibiting further release
 This effect is used with clonidine to have an inhibitory effect on SNS performance
 heteroanwargrawani antargrathni shakti main ek parivartan he ki anya neurons kii gatividhiyon kaa parinaam he
 Then, the plasticity can change the number of vesicles or their replenishment rate or the relationship between calcium and vesicle release
 iske atirikt, yah sidhe calcium pravaah prabhavit ho saktaa he
 Hetero synaptic plasticity can also be post-synaptic in nature affecting receptor sensitivity

 One of the most important features of chemical synapses is that they are the site of action for the majority of psychoactive drugs
 antragranthan s dawaaon dwaara curare, bachhnag, cocaine, afim, sharaab, alesady or anginat dusron ke rup main prabhavit hote hai
 These drugs have different effects on synaptic function and are often restricted to synapses that use a specific neurotransmitter

 bachhnag jo sharir kaa kaaran banataa he, block nirodhatmak prabhaav glycine snayusanchari lene or stimuli upeksha karne ke liye pratikriya kamjor or pehle, mansapeshiyon kii anthan parinamswaroop main bekaabu

 In general, if a stimulating synaptic is strong, a possible action in the presynaptic neuron would be another trigger in the postsynaptic chamber, while the synapses weakened, but would not reach the potential limit for a stimulating postsynaptic EPSP long- term action
 In the brain, however, each neuron forms synapses with many others and, by the way, each receives synaptic inputs from many others

 Evolution does not seek to explain the origin of life
 par kram-vikaas yah samajhaata he ki pracheen saral jivan se aaj kaa jatil jivan kaise viksit hua he
 Seeing the similarities between all the castes of today, it can be said that all the creatures of the earth have a common ancestor
 ise antim saarvjaanik purvaj kehete hai
 All the castes of today have arisen from this through the process of evolution
 sabhi shakson ke paas jeens ke rup main anuvaanshik padaarth hota he
 All the individuals take it from their parents and give it to their children
 santanon ke jeens main thodi bhinnata hoti he
 This is due to mutation and alteration of existing genes during sexual reproduction
 iske kaaran santane mata-pita or ek duusare se thodi bhinn hoti hai
 If those variations are useful, then the chances of survival and reproduction of the offspring are high
 iske kaaran agali peedi ke vibhinn shakhson ke jivit rahane or prajnan karne kii sambhaavna samaan nahin hoti he
 As a result, the traits that make organisms more adapted to their conditions, become more common in the next generations
 ye bhinnataayen dhire-dhire badhati rahati hai
 This process is responsible for the diversity of organisms seen today
 adhikansh genetic utparivartan shakson ko na koi sahaayta pradaan karte hai, na unki dikhaawat ko badalte hai or na hi unhen koi haani pahunchaate hai
 Through genetic drift, these unbiased genetic mutations are only incidentally established in populations and survive for generations
 iske vipareet, prakritik varan ek yadrichhik prakriya nahin he kyonki yah un lakshanon ko bachaati he jo jivit rahane or prajnan karne ke liye jaruri hai
 Natural selection and genetic drift are regular and dynamic parts of life
 arabon varshon main in prakriyaaon ne jivan ke vansh vriksh kii shakhaon kii rachana kii he
 The modern thinking of evolution began with the emergence of the book Charles Darwin's Biology, published in 1859
 iske saath grager mendal dwaara padpon par kiye gaye adhyayan ne anuvaanshiki ko samajhane main madad kii
 The discovery of fossils, advances in population genetics and the global network of scientific research have provided more detailed information on the mechanism of evolution
 vaigyanikon ko ab nayi jatiyon ke udgam kii zyada samaj he or unhone ab prajatikaran kii prakriya kaa avlokan prayogshaala or prakruti main kar liya he
 Evolution is the basic scientific principle that biologists use to understand life
 yah kai vishyon main prayog hota he jaise ayurvigyaan, maanas shaastra, jaev sangrakshan, maanavshaastra, forensik vigyaan, krishi or anya saamaajik-saanskrithik vishay
 The main ideas of evolution are summarized as follows: 19 veen shatabdi main prakritik itihaas ke sangrahalay kaafii lokapriy the
 During this time European explorations and naval expeditions carried the natural scientists and collectors of large museums together
 charles darwin ek graduate the jo prakritik itihaas vigyaan ke vishay main shikshit or prashikshit the
 Natural historians like him used to collect specimens for museums, catalog them, describe and study them
 darwin echemes beagal naamak jahaaj par prakritik vaigyanik kaa kaam kar rahe the
 He was assigned a five-year research trip around the world
 apni yatraaon ke dauraan unhone bahut se jeevon ke namoonay ekatrit kiye or unka nirikshan kiya
 He was particularly interested in the diverse fauna of the coasts of South America and the nearby Galápagos Islands
 darwin ko dur-dur ke sthanon se namoonay ekatrit karne or unka adhyayan karne se vyapak anubhav praapt hua
 From these studies he introduced the idea that every caste evolved from ancestors with similar traits
 1938 main unhone samajhaayaa ki yah ek prakritik prakriya se kaise ho saktaa he
 He named this natural process natural selection
 kisi aabaadi kaa aakaar uske parivesh main maujuud sansadhano kii maatra par nirbhar karata he
 For the population to remain stable for years, it is necessary to balance the population size and available resources
 parivesh jitani santanon ko aashray de saktaa he, us se adhik paidaa hoti hai
 Due to this, not all persons of any generation can survive
 isliye uttarjivan ke liye jaruri sansadhano ke liye hameshaa ek pratyogi sangharsh bana rahata he
 This made Darwin realize that survival does not depend on mere coincidence
 unhen ehsaas hua ki uttarjivan shakson kii bhinnataaon, yaa "lakshanon", par nirbhar karata he
 Some traits aid the survival of individuals and some hinder it
 parivesh ke zyada anukulit shaks apane kam anukulit pratidwandviyon kii tulana main agali peedi ko zyada santaanen dete hai
 Characteristics that hinder survival and reproduction disappear after a few generations
 jo lakshan uttarjivan or prajnan main sahaayta karte hai wo peedi dar peedi jamaa hote rahete hai
 In this way, due to the unequal ability of the person's survival and reproduction, the population changes gradually
 praaniyon or padpon main bhinnataaon ke avlokan prakritik varan ke siddhant kii buniyaad bane
 Darwin observed that orchids and insects have a special partnership that helps in pollination of plants
 unhone dekha ki orchidon main aisi bahut sari sanrachanaayen hoti hai jo kiton ko aakarshith karti hai, taaki pushpon kaa paraag unke sharir main chipak jaae
 In this way the kits carry pollen from a male orchid to a female orchid
 orchidon kii jatil dikhaawat ke baavjood, ye visheshikrut bhaag unheen moolbhoot sanrachanaon se banate hai jinase anya pushp banate hai
 In his book Fertilization of Orchids, Darwin proposes that orchid flowers are more adapted to the environment by the process of natural selection from the existing floral parts
 darwin abhi apane vichaaron par anusandhan or prayog kar hi the ki unhen alfred rasal vailes se ek chitthee mili
 In this letter, Wallace described a theory similar to Darwin's theory
 iske kaaran donon ne in siddhanton kaa sanyukt prakaashan kiya
 Wallace and Darwin both looked at the history of life as a family tree, with the tip of the branch representing today's castes and a common ancestor rather than the branching of the branches
 darwin ne kaha ki jivit chizein rishtedaar hai
 This meant that the whole life originated from a few simple ancestors
 or yah bhi sambhaavna thi ki sabhi jeevon kaa ek hi purvaj ho
 Darwin published his theory of evolution by natural selection in 1859 in his book The Emergence of Animals
 unke siddhant kaa matlab he ki maanav samet sabhi jeev aviraam prakritik prakriyaaon kii upaj hai
 Due to this some religious groups have raised objection to the theory of evolution
 iske vipareet vaigyanik samudaay main 99 pratishat se zyada log is siddhant kaa samarthan karte hai
 Natural selection is often synonymous with survival of the fittest, but this expression originates from Herbert Spencer's book Biology Theory, published in 1864, five years after Darwin's book
 swasthitam kii uttarjivita prakritik varan kii prakriya ko galat dhang se samajhaati he kyonki prakritik varan keval uttarjivan ke bare main nahin he or hameshaa swasthitam hi nahin jivit rahata he
 Darwin's theory of natural selection laid the foundation for the modern theory of evolution
 unke anusandhanon or avlokanon ne dikhaaya ki ek aabaadi ke shaks ek duusare se bhinn hote hai, in bhinnataaon main se kuch bhinnataayen mata-pita se milti hai or prakritik varan in bhinnataaon ko chunata or tyaagta he
 But they could not give a reason for these differences
 apane se pehle ke jeev vaigyanikon kii tarah ve samajhate rahe ki anuvaanshik lakshan upyog yaa anupyog kaa kaaran the, or apane jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshan apane bacchon ko die ja sakate hai
 He tried to find examples of this
 unhone sochaa ki shuturamurg jaise bade udaan rahit pakshiyon kii taangen zyada chalane ke kaaran peedi dar padhi shaktishaalee hoti rahi hongi, or unke pankh kam udne ke kaaran peedi dar peedi kamazor hote rahe honge
 This misconception was called the "heredity of acquired traits", which was part of the theory "change of castes" proposed by Jean Baptiste Lamarck in 1809
 19 veen shatabdi ke ant main yah siddhant ko lamarkwaad kehalaata tha
 Darwin proposed an unsuccessful theory called pangenesis to explain the heredity of traits acquired over a lifetime
 1880 ke dashak main august visman ke prayogon ne dikhaaya ki apane jivan kaal main grahan kiye gaye lakshan bacchon ko nahin die ja sakate hai
 Due to this, Lamarckism was abandoned in some time
 nae lakshan mata-pita dwaara santanon ko kaise die jate hai, iskaa uttar anuvanshiki par grager mendal ke agrani kaary se mila
 His experiments conducted over several generations of pea plants proved that genetic information is split at the time of formation of sex cells in the mother and father and that information from the mother and father is added at random during fertilization
 isaki tulana taash ke patton se kii ja sakati he jahaan kisi jeev ko aadhe pattey mata se yadrichhik dhang se milte hai or baaki aadhe pita se yadrichhik dhang se
 Mendel called this information factors, but later the name Jean became more prevalent
 jin anuvanshiki kii mul ikai he
 They contain information that directs the physical development and behavior of the organism
 jin diene se banate hai
 DNA is a long molecule made up of small molecules called nucleotides
 anuvaanshik jaankaree diene main newcliotidon kii shrunkhlaa ke rup main sangrahit hoti he
 DNA can be compared to an article in which nucleotides act as characters
 jis prakaar varnon kii shrunkhlaa se ek bana lekh jaankaree ko sangrahit karata he, usee prakaar newcliotidon kii shrunkhlaa se bana diene anuvaanshik jaankaree ko sangrahit karata he
 Genes are instructions made from the letters of the alphabet of DNA
 sabhi jin milakar ek "nirdesh pustika" ke jaise hote hai jisamen ek jeev ko banane or kaam karaane kii sari jaankaree hoti he
 Changing these instructions written in DNA due to mutation increases the genetic variation of the population
 diene keshikaon ke andar chromosomon main hota he
 a random mixture of chromosomes from parents at fertilization gives the offspring a unique combination of genes
 langik janan ke dauraan jeenon kaa yah yadrichhik mishran bhi aabaadi kii genetic bhinnata ko badhata he
 Genetic variation of a population also increases with breeding with another population
 is kaaran aabaadi main wo jin aa sakate hai jo usamen pehle se maujuud nahin the
 Sequence is not a random process
 haalanki diene main utparivartan yadrichhik dhang se hota he, par prakritik varan yadrichhik prakriya nahin he, uttarjivan or prajnan kii sambhaavna parivesh par nirbhar karti he
 The evolution is the result of natural selection over billions of years of flawed copying
 kram-vikaas kaa parinaam bakubi rachaa gaya jeev nahin hota he
 The result of natural selection is adapted organisms of their existing environment
 kram-vikaas kisi param lakshya kii taraf pragati nahin he
 Evolution does not attempt to create more developed, more intelligent or more complex organisms
 udhaaharan ke liye, pissu bichchhu makkhi kehalaae jane vaale ek pankhons vaale jeev ke vanshaj hai, or ajagaron main abhi bhi nanhee sanrachanaayen hoti hai jo unke purvajon ke pichley pairon ke avshesh hai
 Rapid changes in the environment usually lead to extinction of the maximum castes
 prithvi par rahi 99 pratishat se adhik jatiyaan vilupt ho chuki hai
 Five major mass extinctions have occurred since the beginning of life on Earth
 inke kaaran jatiyon kii vividhta main badi or aakasmik giravat hui he
 The most recent of these is the cretaceous-paleogene extinction event, which took place 6
6 million years ago
 genetic drift ek jati kii aabaadiyon main eleelon kii aavruti ke badalane ko kehete hai
 a allele is a variation of a gene
 ye baalo kaa rang, twachaa kaa rang, ankhon kaa rang, rakt prakaar aadi nirdhaarit karte hai
 Genetic drift does not introduce new alleles into the population, but it can reduce genetic diversity by removing any alleles from the population
 genetic drift eleelon ke yadrichhik chayan se hoti he
 Selection is truly random when no external force influences it
 udhaaharan ke liye, samaan maap or bhaar par bhinn rangon ke kanchon se bhare ek apaardarshee thile se kuch kanche nikaalnaa ek yadrichhik chayan he
 Whether or not a person will be able to give their alleles to their children depends on their survival in which coincidence also plays a role
 sanyog ke kaaran aabaadi main alilon kii aavruti ke badalane kii is prakriya ko genetic drift kehete hai
 Genetic drift has a greater impact on small populations than on larger populations
 hardi-venberg niyam kahata he ki hardi-venberg samyavastha main hone vaali ek badi aabaadi main pidiyon ke saath eleelon kii aavruti nahin badalegi
 But it is impossible for a population of sufficient size to reach this system because these five things are necessary to reach this system
 1) aabaadi kaa aakaar anant hona chahie
 2) The mutation rate should be zero percent, because mutation can change alleles or create new alleles
 3) aabaadi se yaa main pravrajan nahin hona chahie, kyonki aabaadi main aane vaale yaa aabaadi ko chhodane vaale shaks eleelon kii aavruti ko badal sakate hai
 4) There should be no selective pressure on the population, that is, the probability of survival or reproduction of a person should not be more than others
 5) samagam puri tarah se yadrichhik hona chahie, jahaan sabhi nar baraabar aakarshak saathi hon
 This ensures truly random adulteration of alleles
 hardi-venberg samyavastha main aabaadi taash ke patton ke ek deck ke anuroop he; deck ko chaahe jitani baar phenta jaae, usamen na koi nayaa patta aayega or na koi patta nikalegaa
 The alleles in the population here have been compared to deck leaves
 aabaadi bottlenake paryaavaran kii ghatnaon ke kaaran kisi jati kii aabaadi ke teji se kam ho jane ko kehete hai
 a truly random population bottlenac does not favor any allele; That is, it is random which person will survive
 ek bottlenake aabaadi kii genetic vividhta ko kam yaa khatm kar saktaa he
 The subsequent genetic drift may further reduce the genetic diversity of the population
 genetic vividhta kii kami aabaadi ko anya chaynaatmak dabaavon ke jokhim main daal sakati he
 An example of a population bottleneck is the "northern Elephant Seaway"
 19 veen ke atyaadhik shikaar ke kaaran uttari eliphant jalavyaghron kii aabaadi tees shakson se kam ho gai thi
 Due to conservation, the population of these has crossed one lakh and is increasing continuously
 par aabaadi bottlenake ke prabhaav saafe dikhaai dete hai
 In the absence of genetic diversity in the population, these aquifers are at great risk from diseases and are very likely to have genetic disorders
 sansthaapak kaa prabhaav tab hota he jab aabaadi kii ek choti toli baaki aabaadi se alag hokar ek nai aabaadi ban jaati he
 Often this is due to geographical isolation
 is nai aabaadi main alilon kii aavruti aksar puraani aabaadi se alag hoti he
 The genetic designs of the next generations will depend on the genetic designs of the founders, which will be different from the older population
 sansthaapak ke prabhaav kaa ek udhaaharan amish logon ke 1744 ke pencilvenia deshaantaran se miltaa he
 The two founders of the Amishite colony of Pennsylvania had recessive alleles of the Ellis – van Kreveld syndrome
 amish logon kii apane samudaay ke baahar shaadi na karne kii pratha ke kai pidiyon tak chalane ke kaaran un main elice–vine creveld sanglakshan kii aavruti baaki aabaadi se kaafii zyada he
 In physics, simple periodic motion is the speed in which the direction of the force under which the object moves, is always opposite to the displacement and proportional to the magnitude displacement
 udhaaharan - kisi spring se latake dravyaman kii gati, kisi saral lolak kii gati, kisi gharshanrahit kshaitij tal par kisi spring se bandhe dravyaman kii gati aadi
 If the mean position is assumed to be zero displacement then the displacement of the object x at any time t can be expressed by the following equation- jahaan a aayam, f avritti or φ kala he
 In simple periodic motion, the frequency of the moving body depends on the basic properties of the body concerned, while the dimensions and art depend on the initial conditions
 vibhinn prakaar kii gatiyon ko saral aavart gati ke rup main model kiya ja saktaa he
 Many other phenomena can be simplified as simple periodic motion
 saral aavart gati ek aadhaar detii he jiske sahare isse bhi adhik jatil gatiyon ko furiar vishleshan kii sahaayta se nirupit kiya ja sake
 The equation of motion for unidimensional simple periodic motion can be derived with the help of Newton's Second Law and Hooke's Law
 yah sameekaran dwitiya koti vaala, niyat gunaakon vaala, saadhaaran avakal sameekaran he
 Where atah, On solving the above differential equation, its solution gives a sign wave function which is as follows- where In this solution, c1 and c2 are two constants whose values will be determined by the initial state of the system
 iske alaava madhyamaan sthiti ko hi mul bindu maan liya gaya he
 Both these constants also have physical meaning: a is amplitude and ω = 2πf is angular frequency and φ is art
 diferential calculas kii takneekon kaa upyog karke is sameekaran se veg tathaa twaran kaa maan nikaala ja saktaa he: The value of acceleration can also be expressed as a function of displacement: chunki ω = 2πf, And t = 1 / f where t is periodic, in samikarnon ko dekhne se spasht he ki aavriti or aavartkaal pind ke aarmabhik kala tathaa aayam par nirbhar nahin hai
 In simple periodic motion, the total mechanical energy of the system is always constant

 ye dharm mukhyatah sadachaar or darshan kii baaten karata he, devataaon or ishwar ke bare main zyaada kuch nahin kahata

 The religion of the ruler is to obey and the duty of the ruler is to obey that command
 isi prakaar pita, pati or bade bhai kaa dharm aadesh dena he or putr, patni evam chote bhai kaa kartavya adeshon kaa paalan karnaa he
 But at the same time it is necessary that the order's rule should be based on justification, policy and justice

 Kannada language has existed since some 2500 years ago and Kannada script has been in use since 1900 years
 kannada anya dravid bhashaaon kii tarah he or telegu, tamil or malayalam is bhashaa se milali-julati hai
 Kannada is very much influenced by the Sanskrit language and many Sanskrit words are also used in the same sense in Kannada
 bharat sarkaar ne kannada ko bhi bharat kii ek shastreey bhashaa ghoshit kiya he
 There are different views regarding the etymology of the words Kannada and Karnataka

 Kannada literature historian R

 Narasimhachar has accepted this view

 It is also said that "karnayo Atti Iti Karnataka" means that which echoes in the ears is Karnataka

 The word Karnat has been used many times in the Mahabharata

 In the texts of Varahamihira's Brihatsamhita, Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara, Gunadhya's Paisachi "brihatkatha", etc
, there is an equal mention of the word Karnat

 But nowadays Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Tulu are considered under Panchdravidian languages

 Apart from Tulu, there are other dialects of Kannada - Kodagu, Tod, Kot and Badag

 The inscriptions of Badami and Shravan Belagol are important among the inscriptions written in the seventh century
 praaia: aathvin shatabdi ke purv ke shilalekhon main gadhy kaa hi prayog hua he or uske baad ke shilalekhon main kavyalakshanon se yukt padya ke uttam namoonay praapt hote hai
 Where the language of these inscriptions is well-formed and mature, there is a strong influence of Sanskrit on it

 The difference is that in Kannada, the vowel "l" as well as the vowel "l" are found under the vowel form and consonants of "a" and "o" under vowels
 pracheen kannada main "r" or "l" prayek ke ek-ek murdhanya rup kaa prachlan tha, kintu aadhunik kannada main in donon varno kaa prayog lupt ho gaya he
 The rest of the sound group is similar to Sanskrit

 Baramulla is situated on the banks of the Jhelum River, locally called "vyath River" in Kashmiri, following the Sanskrit name of the river
 "baraamula" naam sanskrit ke "varahamul" se utpann hua he or aaj bhi kashmiri bhashaa main "varmul" kehalaata he
 "varaha" means boar and "root" means its sharp teeth
 manyata he ki kashmir ghati adikaal main ek satisar naamak jhil ke neeche dubi hui thi, jisamen jalodbhav naamak jal-rakshas rahakar bhay failaata tha

 baad main, nepolian bonapart ne francisi samrajya ke vistaar dwaara kuch ansh tak is kranti ko aage badhaayaa
 As a result of the revolution, the king was removed from the throne, a republic was established, bloody conflicts took place, and finally the dictatorship of Napoleon was established, which spread many values of this revolution in and outside Western Europe
 is kranti ne aadhunik itihaas kii disha badal di
 This led to the decline of the absolute monarchy around the world, new republics and liberal democracies

 This revolution also led to freedom in other European countries and other countries also started fighting for freedom from the monarchy

 France had an autocratic monarchy based on the divine principle of kingship
 isamen raja ko aseemit adhikaar praapt the or raja swechhachari tha
 In the reign of Louis the 14th, autocracy was at its zenith
 usne kaha- "main hi rajya hoon"
 He made laws against his will
 usne shakti kaa atyadhik kendriyakaran rajtantr ke paksh main kar diya
 France expanded by diplomacy and military prowess
 is tarah usne rajtantr ko gambhir pesha banaaya
 The governance that Louis 14th centralized required a worthy king, but his successors Louis 15th and Louis 16th were completely inept
 lui 15waan atyant vilaasi, adoordarshee or niskriy shaasha tha
 Participated in Austria's succession war and the Seven Year War caused great damage to the country's economic condition
 iske baavjood bhi varsay kaa mahal vilasita kaa kendra bana rahaa

 kranti kii purv sandhya par lui 16wein kaa shaasha tha
 He was an indolent and unworthy ruler

 He said that "this thing is legal because i want it
" " apane ek mantri ke tyaagptr ke samay usne kaha ki-kaash! main bhi tyaagptr de paata
 His wife Mary Antoniet had a great influence on him
 vah phijulkharchi karti thi
 He had no understanding of the troubles of the common man
 ek baar jab logon kaa juluus roti kii maang kar rahaa tha to usne salaah di ki yadi roti uplabdh nahin he to log kek kyon nahin khate
 In this way the governance system of the country was completely dependent on bureaucracy
 jo vanshanugat thi
 There were no rules for their recruitment and training and there was no institution that could control these bureaucrats
 is tarah shashan pranali puri tarah bhrasht, nirankush, niskriy or shoshankari thi
 The law of personal law and the will of the king applied
 faltah desh main ek samaan kanoon samhita kaa abhaav tathaa vibhinn kshetron main vibhinn kanoonon kaa prachlan tha
 Due to this chaotic and complicated law, the public did not have knowledge of their own law
 is avyavasthit nirankush tathaa samvedansheel shashan tantra kaa astitv janata ke liye kshtdaayi ban gaya
 These oppressive political circumstances gave way to revolution
 france kii arajakpurna sthiti ke baaren main you kaha ja saktaa he ki "buree vyavastha kaa to koi prashn nahin, koi vyavastha hi nahin thi
 " kranti ke kaarnon ko saamaajik paristhitiyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 French society was heterogeneous and disintegrated
 vah samaaj teen virgon / stats main vibhakt tha
 The clergy in the first states, the nobility in the second states and the general public in the third states
 padri evam kuleen varg ko vyapak visheshadhikaar praapt tha jabaki jansadharan adhikaar viheen tha
 The number of farmers was the highest and their condition was low and thoughtful
 kisaanon ko rajya, carch tathaa anya jamidaaron ko anek prakaar ke kar dene padate the or saamanti atyaachaari ko sahanaa padataa tha
 In a sense, the main reason for the dissatisfaction of the farmers was the hardships and inconveniences being given by the feudal lords and the monarchy was silent on it
 is tarah kisaan itane duhkhi ho chuke the ki ve swayan hi ek krantikari tatv ke rup main parinat ho gaye or unhen kranti karne ke liye maatr ek sanket kii aavashyaktaa thi
 The middle class consisted of moneylender merchants, teachers, lawyers, doctors, writers, artists, employees etc
 unki aarthik dasha main avashya thik thi phir bhi ve tatkaaleen raajnneetik, saamaajik or aarthik paristhitiyon ke prati acroshit the
 This class had no political authority and the behavior of the clergy and the nobility was not good towards them
 is kaaran madhyavarg kulinon ke saamaajik shreshthata se ghrinaa rakhte tha or raajnneetik vyavastha main parivartan kar apane adhikaron ko praapt karne ke icchhuk tha
 This was the reason that he was the main contributor to the French Revolution and he led the revolution
 madhyavarg ke kuch aarthik shikaayatein bhi thi
 Due to the erstwhile commerce trade, this class had acquired wealth, but now in the feudal environment, there were many restrictions on their trade and had to pay tax in place
 ve apane vyapaar vyavsaay ke liye unmukt vaataavaran chaahate the
 For this, he led the revolution
 is tarah ham kah sakate hai ki france kii kranti francisi samaaj ke do paraspar virdohi guton ke sangharsh kaa parinaam thi
 On the one hand there were influential groups from the political point of view and on the other side from the economic point of view
 desh kii raajnneeti or sarkaar par prabhutv kaayam karne ke liye in donon virgon main sangharsh anivaary tha
 Thus the French Revolution of 1789 was a struggle against inequality in French society
 france kii aarthik avasthaa sankatagrast thi
 The state was on the verge of bankruptcy
 vastutah france ke raajaaon kii phijulkharchi tathaa lui 14wein ke lagaataar yudhon ke kaaran shahi kosh khaali ho gaya tha
 After his death, Louis 15th participated in the Austrian succession war and the Seven Year War, which further increased the burden on the treasury and eventually Louis 16th made France's economic condition worse by participating in the American War of Independence
 samraat, samraji or unke parivaar par rajya kii atyadhik raashi kharch kii jaati thi
 The palace of Versailles became a means of looting the treasury
 duusari taraf kar pranali asantoshjanak thi
 Due to privileges, the rich class was exempt from tax and the poor farmer who was economically poor was the only taxpayer
 is tarah rajkosh kii sthiti atyant sochneey ho gai thi
 In France, the government fixed income according to expenditure rather than spending according to income
 rajya rin ke boj tale dabta gaya
 Whether France was unable to pay the interest of the principal money means that the state had reached a state of bankruptcy
 desh kii aarthik durvyavastha ko vyapaar vaanijya ko protsaahan dekar sudhara ja saktaa tha parantu sarkaar kii vaanijya niti itani aniyantrit evam doshapurn thi ki usase rajya main utpaadan evam vyapaar kaa vikaas sambhav nahin tha
 Louis 16th tried to overcome the economic crisis through financial advisors like the Turks, Necker but these reform efforts could not be implemented because the privileged class did not accept the taxation on themselves

 In the context of the role of philosophers in the French Revolution, two opinions emerge - one, the philosophers created the revolution by giving rise to the circumstances of the revolution and secondly the source of the revolution was in the faults of the national life of that time and in the mistakes of the government and The philosophers did not produce a revolution
 kisi bhi mat par nirnay dene ke purv un darshanikon ke vichaaron or kranti ke saath unke sambandhon ko samajhnaa vaanchhneeya hoga
 The determination of the popularity of the ideas of philosophers should be seen on the basis of the volumes and prevalence of the articles printed at that time
 montescue ne apni pustak 'da spirit of loj' main raja ke daivi adhikaron ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya or francisi raajnneetik sansthaaon kii aalochana hi nahin ki varan vikalp bhi prastut kiya
 He wrote that the French government is an autocratic government because in France all the powers related to executive, judiciary and legislature are concentrated in the hands of one person ie the king, so the French people do not have freedom
 isi sadanrbh main usne “shakti ke pruthakkaran” kaa siddhanth diya jiske anusaar shashan ke teen pramukh ang-karypalika, nyaaypalik or vyavasthapika ko alag-alag haathon main rakhane kii salaah di
 He described the Government of England as ideal because there was a constitutional monarchy whereby the citizens were at liberty there
 is prakaar montescue ne shakti ke pruthakkaran ke madhyam se france kii nirankush raaj vyavastha par chot kii uske ye vichaar itane lokapriy hue ki 'da spirit of laaj' ke teen varshon main chah sanskaran prakashit hue
 It is to be noted here that Montescue neither talked of revolution nor the abolition of the monarchy, he just exposed the faults of autocratic monarchy and talked about constitutional monarchy
 waltare ne apni pustakon ke letters on inglish madhyam se britain kii udaar raajnneeti, dharm or vichaar swatantraaa kaa vishad chithran kiya tathaa puraatan francisi vyavastha se uski tulana kii or france main vyaapt buraaiyon evam kamiyon kaa ullekh kiya
 These books became very popular before being banned
 “waltare” ne carch ke bhrasht achaaran, ashishnutaa, anyaay, daman or atyaachaar ke virodh main likhaa
 Pointing fingers at the corruption of the church, he wrote that there is no Christian left because there was only one Christian and he was crucified
 usne likhaa ki kukhyat evam badnaam cheez ko kuchal do
 This was clearly an attack on the tyrannical monarchy of France and the tyranny of the Church
 waltare england ke sanvaidhanik rajtantr ke anuroop hi france main bhi vaisaa hi shashan sthapit karnaa chahta tha
 He said that i prefer the rule of one lion in place of hundred mice
 waltare ne kranti kii baat nahin kii lekin vichaar swatantraaa kii prishthbhumi taiyaar kii
 He exposed the evils of the ancient French system
 usne logon ke samaksh tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kaa aaina prastut kiya or yah bataaya ki aaina main daag kaha he
 Russo talked about the freedom of man through his book "emily", "social Contract", "rusoni"
 isane kaha ki manushya swatantrat paidaa hote hue bhi sarvatra zanjeeron se jakadaaa hua
 The only way to get rid of these chains is to return to the natural primitive state
 ruson ne kaha ki samuhik ichha se bane rajya kaa yah anivaary tathaa saarvbhaum kartavya he ki vah saare samaaj ko sarvopari maanate hue kaary ko sanchalit karen
 The people who have been entrusted with executive power are the executive, not the owner of the people, and their duty is to obey the orders of the people
 is tarah uskaa drudh vishwaas tha ki sarvopari satta janata ke haath main honi chahie kisi kisi ek vyakti yaa sanstha ke haath main nahin
 Sovereign power is rooted in the will of the people which is called "common will"
 rajya ke kanoon ko isi saamaanya ichha kii abhivyakti honi chahie lekin kanoon kaa swaroop aisa nahin rah gaya he, balki yah shaasha kii ichha par nirbhar rahane laga he
 The Russians also did not talk of revolution but considered all people as free and equal and the slogans of the French Revolution were influenced by his ideas of freedom, equality and fraternity
 nepolian ne uske mahatv ko sweekaar karte hue kaha ki yadi ruson nahin hota to france main kranti nahin hoti
 The popularity of the Russian social contract can be gauged from the fact that 13 editions were published in a year
 18veen shatabdi ke shreshth vichaarkon kii rachanaaon ko sankalit kar aam janata tak pahunchane kaa shrey francisi vidwaan didaro ko diya jaataa he isane ek gyaan kosh kaa prakaashan kiya
 In this, evils of governance, corruption of the church and inequality prevailing in every field were highlighted
 france kii sarkaar ne didaron ko apana ghor shatru mana or uski pustak par anek pratibandh lagaae
 a section of thinkers was focused on the economic disorder and analysis prevailing in France at this time
 in arthshaastriyon ko “phisyokrat” ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Prominent among them were the Turgans, the Quessanes, the Mirabs, etc
 quesane mukt vyapaar kaa samarthak tha
 Complete freedom of commercial production and distribution and was opposed to octroi and other taxes

 Therefore, tax should be levied only on land, not on merchants and artisans

 The American War of Independence stamped on the bankruptcy of France
 atah aarthik duravastha ko dur karne ke kram main turgon, nekar, colon jaise arthshaastriyon kii madad lee
 Cologne suggested taxing the privileged oligarchy which the nobles rejected
 antat stasts general kii baithak bulaai gai
 This meeting was taking place 175 years after 1789
 stats general kii baithak kaa samachar sunakar sabhi varg utsahit the
 The nobles hoped that in this meeting they would be able to obtain the privileges which were taken away at the time of Louis 14th
 madhyavarg ke logon kaa manaan tha ki ve apane paksh main pragatisheel nitiyon kaa nirdhaaran karvaa sakenge
 The farmers hoped that by raising their voice against feudal privileges, they would be able to secure their rights and be free from their exploitation cycle
 is tarah francisi rajtantr kaa samarthan karne ke liye francisi jansankhya kaa koi mahatvapurn bhaag taiyaar nahin tha
 In the session of the Estates General, there was a dispute between the third state and other states on the issue of voting system
 matdaan ke bare main kaha gaya ki prayek state kaa ek hi mat mana jayega
 In this way, the privileged class has two and the public has only one opinion
 jansadharan ke pratinidhiyon ne arthath 'tritiy state' ne is matdaan pranali kaa virodh kiya kyonki isse ve bahut main hote hue bhi alpamat main aa jate
 The third state wanted the representatives of the three categories to sit together and decide by majority, but the clergy and the elite wanted separate meetings
 atah tritiy state ne stats general kii baithak kaa bahishkaar kar apane ko samast raashtra kaa pratinidhi maanate hue rashtriya sabha ke rup main ghoshit kar diya or paas ke tennis court main apni sabha bulaai
 The French Revolution reached its end through various stages
 adhyayan kii suvidha kii drushti se kranti ko nimnlikhit chaar charnon main baantkar dekha ja saktaa he
 At this stage the Parisian mob established control of the Bastille fort
 is tarah kranti kii shuruuaat hui
 In fact, the Bastille fort was a symbol of tyranny and tyranny and its fall posed a deep challenge to the archaic system
 is ghatana kaa prabhaav france ke gramin kshetron main bhi padaa or graminon ne saamanti karon ke abhilekhon ko aag laga di
 These proceedings of the public also had a profound impact on the National Assembly
 atah 4 agast 1789 jo raat bhar kaa rashtriya sabha kaa adhiveshan chalaa jisamen kanoon nirmit karke sabhi visheshadhikaron ko samaapt kar diya
 Thus England and America were abolished
 rashtriya sabha kaa mahatvapurn kaary tha- ek samvidhan kaa nirmaan karnaa
 Therefore, the National Assembly was called the Constituent Assembly and on 26 August 1789, the Constituent Assembly declared human rights
 samvidhan sabha ne apane aadarshon tathaa uddeshyon ke rup main maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 This declaration emphasized the principle of equality and it was said that since all human beings are born equal, they should get equal rights
 in adhikaron main swatantraaa, sampatti suraksha tathaa atyaachaar ke virodh kaa adhikaar aadi shaamil the
 In this way, the Constituent Assembly declared the fundamental principles, freedom, equality and dominance of the people
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko ghoshnaa patr main baar-baar duharaaya gaya
 No one could be denied this right
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne carch kii sampatti ko jabt kar liya or janata par carch ke niyantran ko kam karne kaa prayaas kiya
 In this context, the Church was brought under the Kingdom and was transformed from the influence of the Pope of Rome into a National Church
 rajya ke prati padariyon kii vafadari surakshit karne ke liye "civil constichution of cllerji" banaaya gaya
 According to which the priests had to take an oath of allegiance to the state and they were elected by the public
 pope or kuch padariyon ne is kadam kaa virodh kiya
 The clergy who swore allegiance to the state were called "jurors" while those who did not take the oath were called "non-jurors"
 is kanoon se kranti ke viruddh ek maahaul nirmit hone laga kyonki abhi tak chote padariyon ne kranti kaa samarthan kiya tha
 Now they broke away from it and some clergy left the country and went abroad and started campaigning against the revolution in Europe there
 rashtriya samvidhan sabha ne france ke liye likhit sanvadhin taiyaar kiya or is samvidhan ko 1791 main lui solahaven ne apni sweekruti de di
 The Constitution emphasizes two things - one, the sovereign power of the state is vested in the people and second, the separation of power is in the interest of the state and the people
 yadhyapi shashan pranali rajtantratmak bani raheen parantu raja ke adhikaron ko simit kiya gaya
 He is no longer a lawmaker
 raja ko kisi desh se yuddh yaa sandhi karne kaa adhikaar nahin tha
 The authority to legislate was given to an assembly and its members numbered 745
 vyavasthapika ke sadasyon ke nirvachan ke liye nagarikon ko sakriy or nishkray do bhaagon main vibhakt kar diya gaya or matadhikaar keval sakriy nagarikon ko diya gaya
 Active citizens were those over the age of 25 who paid the state direct tax equal to three days' income while inactive citizens were those who were poor
 rashtriya sabha ne france kii prashasnic sanrachana main parivartan kiya
 The entire country was divided into 83 departments by abolishing the ancient provinces
 in departmenton ko Cantan or Comune main baanta gaya
 There was an Election Council to run the rule of each of the units, which were elected by active citizens
 is tarah sthaneey str se lekar kendriya str tak sari rajya vyavastha bargea varg main aa gai
 After the dissolution of the National Assembly, in 1791 AD, a 745-member administrative body came into existence
 is vyavasthapika sabha main adhyaksh ke daahine haath kii ore baithne vaale 'dakshinpanthi' kehalaae
 These people were orthodox and supportive of the monarchy, while those on the left were called 'leftists' and this group was of the original changeists who were radical and revolutionary
 radicals bhi do virgon main bante the- jirondist or doosraa jacobiyan
 Meanwhile, the fear of the French Revolution started spreading to other countries of Europe
 jo padri evam kuleen varg france se bhaag europe ke anya kshetron ke chale gaye the unhone kranti ke viruddh bhaavana failaai
 On the other hand, French revolutionaries wanted to propagate revolutionary principles in other countries as well
 faltah europe ke anya raja shankit hue
 As a result, the relations between revolutionary France and other countries of Europe deteriorated
 austria ne krantikariyon ke manaa karne par bhi france ke rajtantr ke samarthak sharnaarthiyon ko apane yahaan rahane diya tha
 Therefore, in April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war against Austria, but the French army was badly defeated
 is paraajay se france kii janata ko vishwaas ho gaya ki raja ne austria ko france kii sainya shakti or suraksha ke saare bhed bataa die hai
 Hence the public's attitude towards the king became fierce
 in sthitiyon main francisi rajtantr ke samarthan main prasha or austria ne ghoshnaa kii ki france kii janata raja kii ajna kaa paalan kare anyathaa ham unke viruddh kaarywahi karenge
 In this way the French Revolution created a war situation in Europe
 is ghoshnaa se france kii janata or ugr ho gai or usne raja ko gher liya
 The king escaped and took refuge in the assembly
 ab yah vichaar kiya jane laga ki vyavasthapika sabha bhang kii jaae; punah chunaav ho, nayi vyavasthapika sabha bane or vah rajtantr ke bhavishya par apana nirnay de
 With this, the assembly was abolished and a national convention was formed on the basis of adult suffrage
 21 sintabar 1792 ko neshnal kanveshan kaa pratham adhiveshan hua
 The Jacobian and Jirodist parties were prominent in this
 jacobiyan anushaasit or sangathit the
 He had influence on the Parisian crowd
 isamen pramukh netaa the- dante, robspier, heater aadi
 On the other side there were jirondists - these were educated and cultured people
 inhen kitaabi gyaan adhik tha
 As a result, they were not practical politicians
 pramukh netaa the- isnar, madam rolland, briso aadi
 It is to be understood here that both factions were advocates of the Republic, supporting the war against foreign powers
 antar keval swaroop kaa tha
 In fact, Jirodisto took a liberal position in France
 unka maananaa tha kii kranti bahut aage ja chuki he or uskaa ant hona chahie
 They were against bringing more social equality
 ve swatantraaa par adhik jor dete the
 On the other hand, the Jacobians emphasized more on equality and had a harmonious attitude towards the lower classes
 neshnal kanvension ke saamne teen pramukh samasyaayein thi- videshi akraman, raja kii maujuudagi or grihayuddh
 In September 1792, the French army occupied Belgium and in the south Nees and Savoy also came under its control
 in vijayon se holland, austria, prasha or england ghabara gaye
 The revolutionaries also declared in 1792 that the Republic of France was based on feelings of freedom, equality and fraternity, and it was their duty to spread these feelings
 france jin jagahon par aadhipatay kaayam karegaa vahaan krantikari siddhanton ko lagu karegaa or padariyon or kulinon kii sampatti chin legaa or jo bhi desh iskaa virodh karegaa use kranti kaa shutra samaj jayega
 The autocratic monarchy countries of Europe were frightened by this announcement and now the revolution of France turned to the whole of Europe, not France
 atah europea desh kranti ke prasar ko rokane ke liye ekajute ho gaye or england, holland, austria, prasha ke ek gut kaa france ke viruddh nirmaan hua
 This group defeated France in many places
 faltah videshi yuddh main france kii paraajay neshnal kanveshan ke samaksh ek mukhya samasya ban gai
 The National Convention passed a resolution that abolished the monarchy and established the republic
 raja par deshadroh kaa mukadmaa chalaaya gaya or mrityudand kii sajaa di gai
 The policy of the Jirendistas on the question of the slaughter of the king was not clear
 ve rajtantr ke virdohi to the lekin vadh ke prashn par janamat sangrah kii baat kar rahe the
 In contrast, the Jacobians believed that the king's treason had been proved
 atah use mrityudand diya janaa chahie
 Finally, on 16 January 1793, Louis 16th was hanged
 neshnal kanvension ko jacobiyan or jirodishton ke bich sangharsh kii samasya kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 In fact, France was beset by an economic crisis due to war, with prices soaring that the Convention enacted legislation to provide relief, a rule to collect debt from the rich
 in kadamon kaa jirondixton ne virodh kiya
 When Jacobio invaded the Convention with the help of the Paris mob and the commune, he took power and arrested Jirondisto and established a state of terror
 'aatank ke rajya' kii sthapana ke saath hi france ek baar punah avyavashtha kaa shikaar hua
 It was founded under the leadership of Robspier
 isamen krantikari, jansuraksha kii sthapana kii gai thi or jo koi jaikabins ke viruddh kaam karata use mrityudand kii sajaa di jaati
 Robespierre was influenced by the ideology of the Russians
 jiske anusaar “saamaanya ichha” hi saarvbhaumik ichha he
 Robespierre put opponents on the "guillotine" to control power
 atah sabhi vyakti apane jivan ko lekar sashankit ho uthe
 Finally in July 1794, Robespierre was imprisoned and hanged, ending the reign of Terror
 aantak ke rajya ke baad 'thermidorian kii pratikriya' hui
 Liberal Thermidorian leaders took over the power of the country and dissolved the militant state systems, declaring the Jacobians illegal
 aantak ke shashan ke dauraan lagaae gaye mulya tathaa paarishramik par se niyantran uthaa liya gaya
 Due to which the prices rose again, the influence of speculators increased and the rebellions in response, but these rebels were suppressed

 The rights of all the members of the board were equal

 Each year a member term was to end and another member was to be appointed instead
 is tarah neshnal kanvension ke baad france main diarectory kaa shashan shuru hua jo 1795 se 1799 tak chalaa
 Hence, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule
 diarectory kaa yah shashan avyavasthit, dukhamay rahaa
 The Board of Directors was empowered to control the Armed Forces and to appoint Chiefs of Army, to make treaties or to wage war on behalf of France

 Therefore, during the rule of the directory, various kinds of disturbances spread, unemployment increased, trade was halted and its foreign policy was also weak
 aisi sthiti main france kii janata ek aise shaasha kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos kar rahi thi jo desh ke andar or baahar shanti sthapit kar sake tathaa videshi shaktiyon ko parrast kar sake
 During this period Napoleon established the honor of France by military victories and eventually ended the rule of the Directory and established control of power
 1799 main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kiya or france kaa pratham counsal bana or 1804 i
 main usne apane ko samraat ghoshit kar diya or is tarah nepolian ke taanaashaahee samrajyavaadee shashan kii shuruuaat hui
 France is the only country in Europe that has ensured the collapse of the archaic system through revolution
 is kranti kaa prabhaav europe tak hi simit na rahaa
 It affected the whole world
 kranti ke naare swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kaa prasar puure europe main hua
 On the one hand, while it gave opportunity to new powers like nationalism, democraticism to flourish, on the other hand it also laid the foundation of modern dictatorship and militarism
 francisi kranti ke prabhaavon ko nimna binduon ke tahat samajha ja saktaa haih The nature of the French Revolution needs to be understood in light of the ideals of the revolution, the leadership of the revolution, the progress of the revolution, the changes brought during the revolution and the effects on the world
 is drushti se kranti ek aisi kranti thi jiskaa prarambh to kuleen varg ne kiya, phir aage chalakar iskaa netritv madhyavarg ke haathon main aayaa
 It remained under the influence of revolutionary elements for some time and ended with a military dictator
 is tarah francisi kranti us vishaal nadi kii tarah jo ucch parvat shikhar se prarambh hokar maarg main anek chote-mote parvaton ko laanghti hui kabhi teevr gati se, to mand gati se pravaahman rahi
 The French Revolution of 1789 can be seen as a bourgeois revolution
 kranti ke pratham charan main netritv tritiy state ke burjuai tatwon ke haathon main tha
 The middle class leadership should also formulate some principles keeping in mind personal property
 vastutah samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa to kar di gai kintu saamanti adhikaron ko yun hi nahin chhod diya gaya, balki bhumipatiyon kii kshatipurti karne ke baad hi kisaan kisi uttardaayitv se mukt ho sakate the
 Middle class influence can be seen in the Declaration of Human Rights
 sampatti ke adhikaar ko manushya ke naiysargik adhikaron kii shrenee main rakhaa gaya jo burjua hiton ke sangrakshan se sambandhit he
 Similarly, adult suffrage was talked about, but in the Constitution the word "citizen" was used in a very narrow sense
 naagarik ko sakriy va niskriy nagarikon main vibhajit kiya gaya
 Active citizens were those who paid at least three days' income as direct taxes and only had the right to vote
 pratinidhi hone ke liye bhi sampatti kii yogyata ko aadhaar banaaya gaya or yah dhani log hi raajnneetik kriyakalapon main bhaag le sakate the or iskaa matlab tha ki dhani log madhyavarg se jude the
 In this way, the French Revolution destroyed the discrimination based on birth, but was replaced by the new feudalism based on wealth instead of ancient feudalism
 kranti ke dauraan krantikariyon ne nirankush sarkaar dwaara liye gaye rinon kii baat to kii kintu un rinon ko maaf karne kii baat kisi ne nahin kii
 The reason was that this loan was given to the government by the bourgeoisie
 isi prakaar sarkaar ne carch kii sampatti ko to jabt kiya parantu use bhoomihinon ko nahin baanta gaya
 The lands were sold at the highest prices and the middle class had the ability to buy this land
 francisi kranti ne mazdooron ke hiton ko najrandaaj kiya or shramik andolan ko hatotsahit kiya
 The working class played an important role during the revolution, but the bourgeois leadership did not approve of its growing position
 atah neshnal asembli ne nirankush rajtantr yug main nirmit kanoonon ko punah lagu kar diya
 Due to which all trade union related works were banned and guilds were declared illegal
 neshnal essembali main burjuaon kii pradhanta thi or usamen jirondist or jacobiyan bhi burjua varg se sambandhit the
 Although the Jacobians spoke of the interests of the proletariat, the establishment of a state of terror kept bourgeois interests above and army's help was taken to suppress the workers' reactions
 diarectory ke shashan main bhi madhyavargeey hiton ko pramukhataa di gai
 All members of the bicameral legislature that the governing board created were middle-class intellectuals
 nepolian ke sudhaaron par bhi burjuai prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 He protected the right to property in his code of law, preserving bourgeois interests, giving relatively broad rights to the nobles and the middle class benefited from its commercial and commercial reforms
 is tarah kranti ke swaroop main madhyavargeey tatv dikhaai dete hai
 But from the analysis of the entire revolution and its impact, it is clear that in the revolution there was co-existence of farmers, laborers, women with middle class elements
 is tareeke se yah maatr madhyavargeey kranti nahin thi apitu ek lokapriy kranti ke rup main ise dekha ja saktaa he
 The French Revolution took on a worldwide character
 krantikariyon ne 1789 main manushya tathaa naagarik adhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii, jiske tahat kaha gaya ki janm se samaan paidaa hone ke kaaran sabhi manushyon ko samaan adhikaar milanaa chahie or yah sabhi deshon ke liye sabhi manushyon ke liye, sabhi samay ke liye or udhaaharan swaroop sari duniya ke liye hai
 This declaration was made not just for France but for the good of all people everywhere who wanted to be independent and to be free from the burden of autocratic monarchy and feudal privileges
 neshnal essembali dwaara 1792 i
 main compene naamak angeraj nayak ko francisi naagarik kii oopaadhi di gai or use neshnal kanvension kaa pratinidh bhi chunaa gaya
 Similarly, during the revolution, the idea was to expand the revolution to other countries of Europe to keep it stable and strong
 isamen ek aise yuddh kii kalpana kii gai jisamen francisi senaayen padosi deshon main pravesh kar vahaan ke sthaneey krantikariyon se milakar rajtantr ko apdasth kar ganatantron kii sthapana karti he
 The French Revolution was not just a national event, but the whole Europe resonated with the principles - slogans of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke prabhaav itane doorgaami rahe ki samast europe isse aachhadit hua
 It was said in this context that "if France has a cold, then all of Europe sneezes
" ” The French Revolution was not as well planned as the Russian Revolution
 vastutah roosi kranti bolshevikon dwaara suniyojit thi or uskaa uddeshy satta hasil kar sarvhaara kaa shashan sthapit karnaa tha lekin francisi kranti shuru se ant tak ghatnaon or paristhitiyon kaa shikaar raheen or ghatnaayen is tarah se nahin ghati jis tarah se krantikariyon ne chaha balki ghatnaon ne krantikariyon ko apana rasta badalane ke liye majaboor kiya
 If the other states had accepted the third state in the meeting of the States General, the trend of revolution would have been second
 isi prakaar aatank kaa rajya or diarectory ke shashan bhi suniyojit dhang se nahin chale
 From this point of view this revolution was chaotic
 francisi kranti ke mul main tatkaaleen francisi samaaj kii duravastha bhi ek mahatvapurn kaarak thi
 The whole society was divided into privileged and unprivileged classes
 krishakon kii sthiti karon ke boj se kharaab thi to duusari taraf unhen saamanton ke atyaachaar tathaa carch ke hastkshep se bhi shoshan kaa shikaar hona padataa tha
 These conditions led the revolution and the revolutionaries raised their voice against this inequality and gave the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity
 kranti ke dauraan hi samantvaad ke ant kii ghoshnaa hui, visheshadhikaron ko khatm kiya gaya
 The general public had participated in the French Revolution, but by ignoring their interests, the revolution took the form of totalitarianism in which the principles and wishes of any one person dominated
 vastutah kranti ke dauraan robspier ke netritv main ek taanaashaahee sarkaar yaa adhinayakatantr kii sthapana hui thi or aage chalakar nepalian ne bhi adhinayakatantr kii sthapana kii
 The French Revolution was a strong reaction against all the distortions, inconsistencies and fundamental faults prevailing in the ancient system
 kranti ne nirankush rajtantr asamanta par aadhaarit francisi samaaj, vilasitapurna padri varg tathaa aarthik diwaaliyepan ke sankat se jujh rahe kushasan kaa ant kar france main prajatantric shashan pranali kaa maarg prashast kiya
 From this point of view, it can be seen as a progressive revolution
 itnaa hi nahin maanavdhikaron kii ghoshnaa swatantraaa, samanta va bandhutav ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ke naare tathaa rashtriyata kii vichaardhaara se samast vishwa ko avgat karaayaa parinamswaroop vishwa ke kai deshon main raajnneetik adhikaron kii maang ko lekar janandolan hone lage
 The spirit of unification of Italy and Germany was encouraged
 dharm or raajnneeti ke pruthakkaran kaa mudda pehali baar is kranti ke dauraan uthaa
 State and politics were separated from religion
 vishwa itihaas main france kii rajya kranti ko vishisht mahatv praapt he yah maanav itihaas kii ek mahatvapurn ghatana maani jaati he
 In this, not only France, but also brought a priceless change in the life of Europe, in this, by destroying the feudal system that had been prevailing in the past, it gave way to modern democratic system
 rajtantr kii nirankushta samaapt hui or loktantric vaataavarna main logon ne chaiyn kii saans lee
 At this time, the question arises in front of us why the revolution in 1789 AD was not in other European countries but in France first
 18 veen shatabdi ke europe rashtron kaa adhyayan karne se gyaat hota he ki us samay france kii jo sthiti thi usase bhi badtar anya europe rashtron kii thi
 The autocratic monarchy was weighed down by the class with ease and the unbearable burden of taxes
 saadhaaran varg praaia: sabhi europe deshon main maujud the
 The condition of some states was more distorted than France, Prasha, Austria and Russia etc
 were also more distorted than France
 francisi krishak anya europe rashtron kii apeksha khushaal the
 The condition of the ordinary class was worse in other European states
 phir bhi kranti in deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi hui
 The main reason for this was that the French people were aware of their situation
 kranti ke liye yah koi aavashyak shart nahin ki iskaa visphot usee deshon main ho jahaan ke log atyaachaar, anachar or shoshan ke shikaar ho
 Revolution can also happen in a rich and advanced country
 basharte uske nivasee yah mahasus kare ki unke saath anyaay ho rahaa he
 The people of France were realizing this injustice
 or se dur karnaa chaahati thi
 Many philosophers and writers were born there who drew the attention of people to these sufferings through their writings, in spite of the worsening situation of other European countries, there was first a revolution against Louis Solven in France
 is kranti ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Changed form of French feudalism and improved status of farmers francisi kisaanon kii unnat avasthaa or samantvaad kaa badla hua swarup aisa kaaran tha
 This led to the first state revolution in France
 europea desh ke kisaan abhi udaasi kii sthiti main the
 But the French peasants had become independent
 unke paas apni jameen apana makaan itani suvidha ke baavjud samant kar evam samant sevaaon kaa ant nahin hua tha unhen apni aamadani kaa bahut bada hissaa samant kar ke rup main chukaana padataa tha
 And still his position is good
 ve paise bachaakar kuch na- kuch jameen kharid liya karte the jameen kharidne kii bhukh nirantar badhati ja rahi thi isamen samant kar va berogari baadhak the at: ve samant peshon ko hataane kii baat soch rahe the at: madhyam varg ke netritv main unhe bal mila or 1789 i
 main unhone vidroh kar diya
 Lack of tradition of liberal autocracy in France- anya europea deshon main bhi nirankush rajtantr tha
 But the emperors there had reduced their autocracy over time
 prasha kaa raja fredirak apane samay kaa mahaan prabud prashaasak tha
 Other countries of Europe followed by Russia, Italy, Spain etc
 unhone samaynusaar jaataa kii aarthik bhautik tathaa anya kshetron main unnat karne kaa yatha sambhav prayaas kiya
 But France lacked such liberal autocracy
 vahaan ke raja janata kii bhalaai ke liye kuch nahin kar rahe the
 Rather, it became his policy to collect more taxes and exploit the public
 isliye france kii janata isse ub gai thi isliye france kii janata nirankush rajtantr ko samaapt karnaa chaahati thi
 Awareness of medium france main hi sarvapratham kranti hone kaa kaaran vahaan kaa madhyamvarg tha
 Other countries also had a middle class but they were not as cultural, rich and educated as in France
 unamem shakti kaa abhaav tha
 They could not think of rebelling against the king
 france main madhyam varg ke log anek kaaran se apane samraaton se asantusht the
 And for his own defense, Raj was desperate to curb power
 anya europea rajyon main is tarah kii sthiti kaa abhaav tha
 There was no one to lead in other countries, there was a ready middle class in France
 at: sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Usefulness of noble class kuleen vahg ko pahase visheshadhikaar is liye diya gaya tha ki ve shashan chalaane main raja kii madad kare
 And they also used to protect Janata
 parantu dhire – 2 yah kaary raja ke karmchaaree karne laga
 As a result, the usefulness of the nobility ended
 phir bhi iske visheshadhikaar main kisi prakaar kii katautee nahin kii gai
 Hence the peasants and middle class people started hating the Kulinwarg
 anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 There still remained the father of the nobility
 darshanikon kaa prabhaav- In the 18th century, there was a chaotic movement throughout Europe
 darshanik, vichaarak, vaagyanik sabhi deshon main viddhman the
 But the main among them were the French thinkers
 jinhone kranti kaa manovaigyanik aadhaar prastut kiya
 He drew the attention of the people to the evils in the society and gave a voice to the people
 is tarah kaa prayaas anya deshon main nahin kiya ja rahaa tha
 France was the only field of thinkers like Montague, Voltaire Russo
 austria, prasha or rus main is tarah ke vichaarak nahin the
 In other countries of Europe, there was no class of philosophers who gave their real status and created satisfaction in them
 france main hi kranti hone kaa yah ek pramukh kaaran tha
 Lack of political participation england main jab madhyam varg ne jaagarukta ai to use desh kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar diya gaya
 But this was not the case with France
 france kaa madhyam varg apane samraaton se kaaphi asantusht tha
 They were expected
 shikshit hone ke baavjood unhen kulinon kii tarah pratishtha uplabdh nahin thi
 They were not given the opportunity to participate in French politics
 isliye unhone asantusht hokar kranti kaa naaraa buland kiya
 Ineligible king and corruption in administration- france kii rajanithik vyavastha kendrikrut thi lekin raja ayogy the
 The administration was dominated by corruption
 europe ke anya deshon main nirankush shashan totha parantu raja yogya the or shashan par unka purn niyantran tha
 The middle class of France was feeling this administrative corruption
 tathaa isliye vah vidroh karne ke liye taiyaar tha
 Rise of national spirit is samay europe main teji se rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai hone laga
 France was the only country in entire Europe where there was a complete lack of a national spirit
 iske chalate bhi sarvapratham france main hi kranti hui
 Effect of American freedom struggle- 1766 i
 main american swatantraaa sangram prarambh hua
 The American people revolted against England
 france ke sainikon ko bhi is swatantraaa sangram main bhaag lene kaa avasar mila at: unhone yah mahasus kiya ki yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa prapti kii ja sakati he
 He also realized that freedom is possible only through freedom
 france lautne par unhone dekha kii jis swatantraaa ko liye unhonen america main yuddh kiya usee swatantraaa kaa france main purnat: abhaav he
 Hence, he became restless for the revolution here and tried to get freedom through war
 europe ke anya deshon main aisi baat nahin thi
 Superiority of French Civilization france main hi kranti hone kaa ek vishisht kaaran yah tha ki yahan kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe kii sabhyataa or saanskriti anya europe rashtron kii apeksha adhik samrudh or vaibhav purna thi
 Even in terms of governance, the rule of France was highly organized
 france sampoorn europe sabhyataa or saanskriti kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Paris is considered the largest center of literature and thought in all of Europe
 france janamat anya europe rajyon kii apeksha adhik jaagrit or aalochanatmak tha
 As a result of all these reasons, in 1789 AD, there was revolution in France and not in other European states

} SETI refers to the collective activities of searching for life in the distant universe in America
 talashne ke kaam main laga he
 SETI uses radio signals for this purpose
 iske alaava, optical doordarshee or anya vidhiyon ko prayog kiye jane kii bhi siforishein kii gai hai
 Sety is busy with her efforts and keeps searching for information about intellectual life on another planet
 vishwa kii shaktishaalee vedhashalaon or doordarshiyon kii madad se seti brahmad ke kone kone se aane vaale radio sampreshnon ko ekatrit kar unka vishleshan karti he
 As of now, we are alone in the universe as yet calculated
 antariksh main nirvaat hone ke kaaran vah apane aap main koi vishesh shaktishaalee radio sanketvahak nahin he
 According to the scientists at SETI, if an unknown civilization in remote space catches radio signals sent from Earth, it should leave the information in space in the north like we release information through radio and TV stations
 yadi antariksh main koi sabhyataa he to unke liye in sandeshon ko pakadana bhi acha-khaasaa chunauteepurn kaary hoga
 They believe that the way we have the capability and technology to deliver our messages to a distance of several million light years, the same technology can also be with the people of another planet
 jaise prithvi se radio, tivi, radar ke sanket nikalakar antariksh main failte hai vaise hi anya grahon ke radio sanket bhi antariksh main honge
 By catching these signs one can learn a lot about the other world
 seti dwaara ho rahe is adhyayan ko aarambh main america ne vittiya madad di lekin baad main ise band kar diya
 Many researchers at SETI also believe that to search for an outer civilization, we must be sent at a moderate frequency and any message sent out of the solar system must remain in one place in space
 iske liye seti ke khagolavidon ne vishalkay superkamputaron dwaara sandeshon ko scan karne kaa kaam kiya he, jiske baad antat:yah kaary ek vikendrikrut computing network, seti@home ko de diya gaya
 By the way, no signs of any other astronomical civilization have been revealed so far
 anek khagolavidon ke anusaar koi bhi bahari sabhyataa radio sandeshon kaa aadan-pradaan nahin karegi, chunki bahut sambhav he ki vah prithvi kii sabhyataa se kahin aage hogi
 Therefore astronomers are also searching for laser rays in space
 yadi antariksh main suchanaaen bhejne kaa yah prayaas antat: vifal rahata he to seti ko koi yaan hi bhejnaa padegaa, jo isse bhi kahin kathin kaary hoga

 nirvana kaa shabdic arth he - 'buja hua' 
 But it has special meaning in Buddhism, Jainism and Vedic religion
 shraman vichaardhaara main pidaa yaa du:kha se mukti paane kii sthiti he
 "nibbana" in Pali means "to attain salvation" - that is, freedom from the fire of greed, hatred and confusion
 yah buddha dharm kaa param satya he or jain dharm kaa mukhya siddhant
 Part of the category of yadhyapi 'mukti' ke arth main nirvana shabd kaa prayog gita, bhagwat, raghuvansh, sharirak bhashya ityadi nae-puraane granthon main miltaa he, tathaapi yah shabd baudhon kaa paribhaashik he
 In Sankhya, Nyaya, Vaiseshika, Yoga, Mimamsa and Vedanta, the words Moksha, Upvarga, Dishayarayas, Mukti or Swargapriya and Kaivalya have been dealt with, but in Buddhist philosophy only the word Nirvana has come and is specifically interpreted
 buddha dharm kii do pradhan shakhaayen hai—hinayan or mahayan 
 Of these, all the texts of the Hinayana branch are in Pali language and represent the original form of Buddhism
 mahayan shakha kuch peeche kii he or uske sab granth saskrit main likhe gaye hai
 In the Mahayana branch itself, Buddhist doctrines have been represented philosophically by the esoteric logic by many masters
 pracheen kaal main vaidic aacharyon kaa jin buddha aacharyon se shastrarth hota tha ve praayah mahayan shakha ke the
 Therefore, what is meant by the word Nirvana can be decided by his words
 bodhisattva nagarjun ne madhyamik sutara main likhaa he ki 'bhavasantati kaa uchchhed hi nirvana he', arthath apane sanskaron dwaara ham baar baar janm ke bandhan main padate hai isse unke uchchhed dwaara bhavabandhan kaa naash ho saktaa he
 In the Ratnakootasutra, Buddha says: Nirvana is caused by the loss of raga, malice and attachment
 bajrachchhedika main buddha ne kaha he ki nirvana anupadhi he, usamen koi sanskaar nahin rah jaataa
 In relation to Nirvana, the secondary author Chandrakirti has said that the omnipresence of omnipresence is called nirvana
 yah shoonyata yaa nirvana kya he ! na ise bhav kah sakate hai, na abhaav
 Because the loss of knowledge of both emotion and absence is the name of Nirvana, which is beyond and beyond both the non-sense and the non-sense
 madhavacharya ne bhi apane sarvadarshansangrah main shoonyata kaa yahi abhipraay batalaaya he—'asti, naasti, ubhay or anubhay is chatushkoti se vinimunkti hi shoonyatv he'
 In the Secondary Sutra, Nagarjuna has said that the experience of existence and nostalgia is undesirable
 budhimaan log in donon kaa apshamrup kalyaan praapt karte hai
 It is clear from the appropriate sentences that there is no receptive relation of mind to the emptiness of the word nirvana
 mai bhi mithyaa, sansar bhi mithyaa
 One thing to note is that Buddhist philosophers do not believe in nature or even the nature of the soul
 ve ek mahashunya ke atirikt or kuch nahin maanate
 Part of the category of buddha ne nirvana ko man kii us param shanti ke rup main varnit kiya jo trishna, krodh or duusari vishaadakaari man:sthitiyon se pare he
 a creature who has found peace in life, who has compassion for all and who has abandoned all desires and shackles
 This peace is attained only when all the present desires cease and the desires that may arise in the future are destroyed
 In nirvana, due to craving and malice, they are eliminated from the root, leaving man from all kinds of sufferings or the cycle of rebirth in the world
 paali ke siddhanton main nirvana ke duusare drushtikon bhi hai; ek ke anusaar ye usee tarah he jaise kisi bhi tathy main riktatako dhundhna
 saath hi ise chetana kii sampurna punarvyavastha or chetan kii paraten kholane kii tarah bhi dikhaaya jaataa he
 Scholar Herbert Geanter states that nirvana makes "ideal personality, true human being" a reality
 dhammapad main buddha kehete hai ki nirvana hi "param anand" he
 This bliss is everlasting and paramount which is an integral part of the peace that comes from enlightenment or bodhi
 yah anand nashwar vastuon kii khushi se ekadam alag hoti he
 Knowledge associated with nirvana is expressed through the word Bodhi
 buddha nirvana kii vyakhya ko "sahaj" man ke rup main karte hai
 a mind that has reached a state of complete clarity and comprehensibility due to the end of desires
 buddha ne iskaa varnan "mrityuhinata" ) tathaa param aadhyatmik gyaan, jo vah sahaj parinaam he jo sadaachari jivan vyateet karne or shreshth aath-sutreey adarsh path par chalane par miltaa he ke rup main kiya he
 From such a life is made of the treaty of karma and vaana
 nir kaa arth he "alag hona, dur hona yaa uske bina" or wan kaa arth he "mukti" jaise "bahati hawa" or "soonghnaa, ityadi"
 The Abhidharma-mahavibhasha-shastra, which is an all-round idea, describes all possible meanings of the word originating from Sanskrit: sutron main nirvana ko kabhi bhi ek sthaan ke rup main nahin mana gaya he, balki ise sansar kaa hi virodhabhas mana gaya he, jo vastav main agyanta kaa paryaay he
 
 Having said: nirvana kaa sateek arth he- gyaan kii prapti- jo man kii pahchaan ko khatm karke mul tathy se judaav paidaa karata he
 Theoretically, Nibbāna is said to be a mind that is "not coming and not going" and has attained a state of perpetuity, leading to "liberation"
 sthirataa, sheetaltaa or shanti bhi iske arth hai
 The attainment of nirvana is compared to the end of avidya
 jisase us man:sthiti kii ichha jaagrit hoti he jo jivan chakra se mukti dilaati he
 The world is basically a product of craving and ignorance
 a person can attain Nirvana even without death
 jab nirvana praapt kar chuke vyakti kii mrityu hoti he, to us mrityu ko moksh ] kehete hai, kyonki vah jivan-maran or punarjanm ke aakhri judaav se purna rup se chhot jaataa he or uskaa phir se janm nahin hota
 buddha dharm sansaarik astitv ke ant ko param lakshya maanata he or yahi nirvana kii prapti he; aise vyakti kii mrityu ke pashchaat kya hota he,parinirvāṇa ye samajhaayaa nahin ja saktaa, kyonki ye anubhav manushya kii samaj kii seemaa se pare he
 Through a series of questions, Shariputta convinced a monk that Tathagata could not be considered true or reality even in his present life, so it would not be right to speculate on the situation after the death of Arhant
 See Tathagata # Inscrutable ek str kaa gyaan praapt karne ke baad vyakti nirvana ko maansik chetana kii tarah anubhav karata he
 According to some beliefs, if one goes on the path of Nibbana, it leads the Arahant towards the attainment of enlightenment and samadhi
 ant:karan ke vikaas se is sthiti par pahunchane par yadi yogi ko ye pataa chalata he ki ye sthiti banaavati he or isliye nashwar he, to sabhi bandhan khatm ho jate hai, vyakti arhant ban jaataa he or nibbaan kii prapti hoti he
 The mind is aware; It is conscious
 nirvana se chetana khulti he or man is asahaj vishwa ke sabhi bandhanon se mukt hokar jaagruk hota he
 The Buddha has described this in many ways
 inamen se ek is prakaar he: Consciousness is formless, it has no end and it is stunning from all sides
 ajaan pasanno or ajaan amaaro likhte hai ki vigyaan shabd chetan kii gunvattta ke sandarbh main dekha jaataa he
 According to him "vinānāna" should be understood more than its literal meaning: "buddha, like many philosophers equivalent to him, used the language understood by the common people in a larger scope, rather than the pretentiousness and hypocrisy of learning, which made his The message can be understood as much as possible
 So 'knowledge' can be taken here in the sense of 'knowing', but not partial broken, discriminatory knowing, which usually means Interpretation is
 balki iskaa arth hona chahie praarambhik or utkrisht gyaan, nahin to jis sandarbh main isaki baat ho rahi he, vahaan virodhabhas dikhaai degaa
" phir unhone aage bataaya ki in shabdon ke chayan ke peeche kya kaaran rahaa hoga
 ye "aprakat chetana" chah indriyon kii chetana se bhinn he, baaki chetnaaon kii ek "sataha" hoti he, jinaki vajah se pratikriya utpann hoti he
 According to Peter Harvey, ancient texts have two opinions on the issue of whether the word "conscious" is accurate or not
 a liberated person experiences it spontaneously
 ek vyakhya ke anusaar, "prakashwan chetan" nirvana ke samaan he
 Others do not agree with this, according to him, it is not nirvana, but it is a kind of consciousness that only the arhants attain
 majzima nikaay main ise rikt sthaan kii tarah bataaya gaya he
 For the liberated people, there is no need for the meditation of light consciousness, mental consciousness associated with Nibbana, and it is superior to all parts of mental consciousness
 yah buddha purv ke upanishdaur bhagavadgitake atmagyaan kii avadharana se purnat: bhinn he, jo vyakti kii antarman kii chetana ko jagaane kii baat karte hai, jabaki isamen is pahalu par jor nahin diya gaya he or isamen kisi bhi tarah "swa" se bhramit nahin hona chahie
 iske alaava, buddha ke chathe dhyaanake anusaar, ye aseemit chetana ke kshetra main utkrisht hota he, jo swayan "main" ke mithyabhimaan par samaapt nahin hota
 Nagarjuna has also hinted at two places on the level of consciousness in Dignikaya
 unhone likhaa he: The monk declared that earth, water, fire and air, long, short, fine and hard, good, etc
 are all extinguished in consciousness
 

 yahaan lanbaa or chota, maheen or sakht, acha or bura ye sabhi naam or rup samaapt ho jate hai
 The idea associated with this, which is supported in Pali theory and contemporary Theravada, while it is not mentioned in Theravada Bhashya and Abhidhamma, states that the mind of the Arahant is Nibbana
 mahayanabuddha dharm main, nirvana or sansar ko jab dharmakayaki param prakruti ke taur par dekha jaataa he, to ye donon pruthak-pruthak nahin hai
 a person can attain Nirvana through the Buddhist path
 agar ye donon ekadam alag hote to aisa sambhav nahin hota
 yani nirvana or sansar kaa dwaitvaad paaramparik taur par hi sateek he
 Another way to arrive at this conclusion is the analysis that all facts are empty of an essential identity, so suffering is not congenital under any circumstances
 Therefore, freedom from grief and its causes is not a non-material process
 is vichaar kii or vyakhya ke liye dwisatya siddhant ko dekhen
 Theravadmat indicates the mutual contradiction between the world and Nibbana, where the quest for liberation begins
 saath hi, yahi virodhabhas param lakshya kii ore bhi le jaataa he, jo vastav main sansar main utkrisht hona or nibbaan ke raste mukti kii prapti he
 Theravada is in many ways different from the Mahayana doctrine, which itself begins with the dualism of the world and nirvana, showing this polarization not just as an initial text, but it leads to a larger experience of monotheism
 
 paali sutara ke drushtikon se buddha or arhant kii pidaaen or tehraav, yani sansar or nibbaan pruthak-pruthak hai
 Both views agree that Shakya Muni Buddha attained nirvana while living in this world, as he was seen by all to be free from the world
