 Inside it is a mosque which has a two-tier octagonal column

 While it was built between 1538 and 1545 by the Afghan ruler Sher Shah Suri, who seized the throne of Delhi from the Mughal emperor Humayun
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki mughal badshaah humayun kii is kile ke ek se neeche girane ke kaaran durghatanavash mrityu ho gai
 It is said that Delhi was first settled by the Pandavas as their capital Indraprastha, that too 1400 years before BC, but there is no firm evidence for this

 Although Mahabharata is considered as a scripture, but many of the Mahajanapadas like Kashi, Kosala Anga, Magadha, Asmak, Avanti, Gandhara, Chedi etc
 mentioned in Buddhist literature "angusad Nikaya" are also mentioned in Mahabharata
 It is an indication that this book is not only mythological, but also preserves some historicity
 puraane kile kii purvi diwaar ke paas dubaara khudaai 1969 se 1973 ke bich bhi kii gai thi
 There is no evidence of human settlement from Mahabharata, but from the Mauryan period to the early Mughal period, this area was full of human settlement

 It is said that the Mughal Emperor Humayun had established his own city "dinpanah" on the same mound on the banks of river Yamuna under which Indraprastha is buried
 tatpashchaat shershah sur ne jab humayun par vijay praapt kii to sabhi bhawanon ko nasht kar vartmaan dilli, shershahi yaa “shergarh” kaa nirmaan prarambh karavaaya
 In the meantime, Humayun reunited and attacked and regained his lost sultanate
 samajha jaataa he ki kile kaa nirmaan kaary humayun ne hi 1545 main purna karaayaa tha
 The old fort was originally built on the banks of the river Yamuna, but from the slopes of the north and west directions, it appears that a moat connecting the river was built for safety

 While bending, his legs got stuck in a long coat and he lost his balance and fell down

 Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas mentioned in the Mahabharata, was probably at this place
 puraane kile main vibhinn sthanon par shilapaton par yah vaakya likhe hai
 Where was Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas? People have been debating about this

 Scholars believe that the outline of Purana Qila was also similar

 Although the followers of this religion call it a real religion, in the media it is seen as a satirical religion

 Pastafari also believes that all evidence of evolution was kept by the flying Spaghetti demon himself to test the reverence of the pastors

 jokhim prabandhan kii shabdaawalee ISO guide 73, "jokhim prabandhan shabdaawalee" main paribhaashit he
 In ideal risk management, a prioritization process is adopted whereby the probability of the greatest damage risk is first dealt with and the probable risks with less damage are then dealt with in descending order

 Intangible risk management identifies a new type of risk that has a 100% probability of occurrence but such risk is ignored by the institution due to an inability to identify

 According to ISO 31000 standard "risk Management - Implementation Principles and Guidelines", the process of risk management consists of the following different stages: sandarbh kii sthapana main shaamil hai: After establishing the context, the next step in the risk management process is to identify potential risks
 jokhim un khataron ke bare main hai jo utprerit hokar samasyaayein paidaa karte hai
 Therefore, risk identification should be initiated from the source of the problem or with the problem itself

 The chosen method of risk identification depends on culture, industry practice and compliance
 strot, samasya yaa ghatana kii pahchaan karne ke liye pahchaan paddatiyon kaa nirmaan templeton yaa khaakon ke vikaas se hoti he
 Common methods of risk identification are: jokhimon kii ekbar pahchaan ho jane par kshamta, haani kii sambhavit gambhirtha evam ghatit hone kii sambhaavna ke sambandh main unka moolyankan avashya kiya janaa chahie
 These results can be either simple to measure, such as in the event of a lost building's value or in the unlikely event of an unexpected event that it is impossible to know for sure
 isliye, moolyankan prakriya main jokhim prabandhan yojana ke karyanvayan ko uchit praathamikta pradaan karne ke liye sarvshereshth sambhav shikshit anumaan karnaa jokhimamay he
 The fundamental difficulty in risk assessment is to determine the rate of occurrence because statistical information is not available for all types of incidents in the past
 iske alaava, abhautik sampatiyon ke maamle main parinaam kii gambhirtha kaa moolyankan aksar kathin hota he
 Property valuation is another question that needs to be considered
 is prakaar, sarvshereshth shikshit vichaar evam uplabdh sankhyikee soochna ke praathmik strot hai
 Nevertheless, risk assessment should present such information to the management of institutions so that primary risks are easily understood and risk management decisions can be prioritized
 is prakaar, jokhimon ko parimanit karne ke kai siddhant or prayaas hai
 There are undetermined different formulas for risk, but the widely accepted formula for measuring the magnitude of risk is: ghatana kii dar or ghatana ke prabhaav kaa gunanfal jokhim ke baraabar hota he Subsequent research clearly shows that the economic benefits of risk management are less dependent on the formulas used but they depend on frequency and methods of risk assessment
 vyavsaay main, jokhim moolyankan ke nishkarshon ko vittiya shabdon main prastut karne main sakasham hona aavashyak he
 Robert Courtney Jr
 suggested a formula for presenting risk in economic terms
 The Courtney formula was approved as an official risk analysis method for United States government agencies
 yah formula ALE kii gananaa karne kaa suzav detaa he or anumaanit kshati mulya kii tulana suraksha niyantran karyanvayan laagat se karata he
 Once the risks have been identified and evaluated, all risk management techniques fall into one or more of the four categories listed below: in ranneetiyon kaa adarsh prayog sambhav nahin ho saktaa he
 Some of these may include business issues that are not acceptable to risk management decision-making establishments or individuals
 sanyukt rajya raksha vibhaag, raksha adhigrahan vishvavidhyalay kaa anya strot bachane, niyantrit karne, sweekaar karne yaa sthanantarit karne ke liye in virgon ko ACAT namankit karti hai
 This acronym ACAT is reminiscent of the second ACAT that is used in the receipts of the United States defense industry, in which risk management participates prominently in decision-making and planning
 isamen jokhim vaali gatividhi kaa nishpaadan nahin karnaa shaamil hota he
 An example of this would be not to buy any property or business so that it does not have to take responsibility for its liability
 Another example might be not to fly to avoid the risk of plane hijacking
 Responding to all risks is seen in the hedge, but avoiding the risks means losing the potential profit that could be found by taking the risk
 haani uthaane ke jokhim se bachane ke liye kisi kaarobaar main pravesh nahin karne se laabh praapt karne kii sambhaavna ko dur karata he
 Hazard prevention refers to the prevention of risks in an emergency
 khatre kii rokthaam kaa sarvapratham or sabase adhik kargar charan khataron kaa unmoolan he
 If it takes too long, costs too much, or is otherwise impractical, the second step is to reduce
 isamen aisi paddatiyon kaa samavesh hota he jo haani kii ugrata yaa haani ke ghatit hone kii sambhaavna kii sangeenta ko kam karata he athwa aisa hi kuch
 udhaaharan ke liye, jal chhidkaav yantra ko aag se hone vaali kshati ke jokhim ko kam karne ke liye aag ko bujhane ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 This method can lead to a much larger loss through water loss and hence it may not be favorable
 halon agni shaman pranali jokhim ko kuch kam kar sakati he lekin adhik laagat is yojana-niti ke liye nishedhi ho sakati he
 Modern software development methods reduce risk by developing and providing software based on growth
 praarambhik paddatiyon is tathy se prabhavit hui ki unhone vikaas ke keval antim charan main hi software pradaan kiye
 Hence, the problems faced in the initial stages meant costly remodeling in which often the entire project was at risk
 punrariti main vikaas kar, softver pariyojnaayen ek ekal punrariti main nasht kiye gaye prayaas ko simit kar sakati he
 If a person receiving services from an external source can demonstrate high efficiency in managing and mitigating risks, then the act of obtaining services from an external source may become an example of risk reduction
 is sthiti main companiyaan keval apni kuch vibhageeya jaruraton ko bahari sroton ko theke par detii he
 For example, a company can only outsource its software development, production of hardware goods or customer support requirements to another company, while operating the business itself
 is prakaar, company utpaadan prakriya ke bare main adhik chintaa kar, vikaas dal kaa prabandhan kar, yaa kol centre ke liye ek bhautik sthaan dhundh kar vyavsaay ke vikaas par apana dhyaan kendrit kar sakati he
 It involves accepting it when there is a loss
 sachhee swa-beemaa is shrenee main aati he
 Risk retention is a viable strategy for small risks where the cost of insurance against the risk may be higher over time than the total loss
 sabhi jokhimon ko jinhen taala athwa sthaanantarit nahin kiya ja saktaa unhen bhul se hi sahi bane rahane diya jaataa he
 This includes risks that are so large or catastrophic that they cannot be insured against because the repayment of installments will be incurable
 An example of this is war because most of the assets and risks are not insured against war, so the loss from war is retained by the insured
 bimaakrit raashi se upar kii kisi bhi raashi kii sambhavit kshati bhi pratidhaarit jokhim hoti he
 It can also be assumed that if the probability of any major loss is minimal or the cost of a large insurance coverage covers such a large amount of security, then it will obstruct the goals of the organization more
 peshewaron or vidwaanon donon kii hi shabdaawalee main beemaa anubandh kaa kray aksar "jokhim kaa hastantaran" kaha jaataa he
 Although, technically, the purchaser of the contract is generally legally responsible for the loss transferred, it means that the correct interpretation of insurance can be interpreted as a post-compensatory compensation arrangement
 udaahranarth, vyaktigat aghaton ke liye beemaa policy gaadi kii durghatana kii jokhim ko beemaa company ko hastantarit nahin karti he
 The risk remains with the policy holder ie the person who is the victim of an accident
 beemaa policy keval yah pradaan karaati he ki yadi kisi durghatana main policy dharak bhi shaamil hota he to policy dharak ko kuch kshatipurti dey hoti he, jo ksht / kshati ke anupatik hoti he
 Some methods of managing risk fall into multiple categories
 jokhim pratidhaaran nikaay takneekee taur par ek varg ke liye jokhim dhaaran kar rahe hai, lekin puure samooh main iske vistaar se samooh ke sadasyon ke bich hastantaran shaamil ho jaataa he
 This is different from traditional insurance in that no installment is exchanged between group members but losses are assessed for all group members
 har jokhim ko maapne ke liye uchit niyantranon kaa chunaav athwa pratyupaay karen
 Appropriate level of management approval is necessary to reduce the risk
 udhaaharan ke liye, sanstha kii chhavi se sambandhit jokhim ke peeche ucch stareey prabandhan kaa nirnay hona chahie jabaki computer virus jokhim ke nirnay kaa adhikaar soochna praudyogiki prabandhan ke paas rahegaa
 Risk management planning should propose feasible and effective security controls for risk management
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek vidit ucch jokhim vaale computer virus ke jokhim ko anti virus software praapt evam karyanvit kar kam kiya ja saktaa he
 a good risk management project should have fixed schedules for control of implementation and the people responsible for those tasks
 ISO / IEC 27001 ke anusaar jokhim vishleshan ke turant baad puraa hone vaale charan main jo padaav aata he usamen jokhim upachaar yojana taiyaar karnaa shaamil he, jise un faislon ke sambandh main dastavej pesh karnaa chahie ki pahchaan kiye gaye prayek jokhim kaa prabandhan kaise kiya janaa chahie
 Often the reduction of risks refers to the selection of security controls that must be documented in a description of feasibility that determines which particular controls are chosen based on objectives and on what standards and why
 kriyanvayan jokhimon ke prabhaav ko kam karne ke liye sabhi suniyojit paddatiyon kaa anupaalan karen
 Buy insurance policies for risks that have been decided to be transferred to an insured, avoiding all risks that can be avoided by lowering others and retaining balances without sacrificing company goals
 praarambhik jokhim prabandhan yojana kabhi paripurna nahin hogi
 The consequences of practice, experience and actual loss will make the changes in the plan mandatory and provide all possible permission for various decisions to be taken to deal with the risks being faced
 jokhim vishleshan ke parinaam or prabandhan kii yojanaon ko samay-samay par adhyatan kiya jaan chahie
 There are two primary reasons for this: agar jokhimon kaa anuchit moolyankan kiya gaya he or anuchit praathamikta pradaan kii gai he, to asambhavit nuksano ke jokhim se nipatane main samay kii barbaadi ho sakati he
 Spending too much time assessing and managing unforeseen risks may lead to more profitable use of resources in other tasks
 asambhavy ghatnaayen ghatati hi hai lekin yadi jokhim ke hone kii sambhaavna bhi asambhavit ho to yahi behatar hoga ki jokhim ko apane saath hi barkaraar rahane diya jaae or vastav main haani hone par parinaam ke saath nipta jaae
 gunatmak jokhim kaa moolyankan vyaktiparak hota he or isamen saamanjasy kaa abhaav hota he
 The primary justification for the formal risk assessment process is legal and official head
 jokhim prabandhan kii prakriya ko atyadhik praathamikta pradaan karnaa kisi sanstha ko pariyojna ko purna karne nahin detaa he, yaa yahaan tak ki prarambh hi nahin karne detaa he
 This is especially true when other work is suspended until the risk management process is considered complete
 jokhim or anishchayta ke bich antar ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana mahatvapurn he
 Risk can be measured by the product of effect and probability
 company vitt ke saath lagu hone vaala, jokhim prabandhan kisi form ke tulan patr main vittiya athwa parichaalan sambandhi jokhim ko maapne, dekh-rekh karne or niyantrit karne kii takanic he
 See the price at risk
 da basel II kii banaai ruparekha jokhimon ko bazaar jokhim, rin sambandhi jokhim or parichaalan sambandhi jokhim main vibhajit karti he or inamen se prayek ghatak ke liye puunjigat aavashyaktaaon kii gananaa karne kii paddati kaa bhi vistrut vivaran detii he
 Risk in an enterprise of risk management is defined as a potential event or situation that may have a negative impact on the stated enterprise
 iskaa prabhaav puure astitv, sansadhano, utpaada or sevaao athwa udhyam ke upabhoktaaon par saath hi saath bahya rup se samaaj, bazaar athwa parivesh par pad saktaa he
 Enterprise risk management in a financial institution is generally considered to be a combination of credit risk, interest rate risk or asset liability management, market risk and operational risk
 adhiktar saamaanya maamle main, apane sambhavit parinaam se nipatane ke liye har sambhavya jokhim ke paas purv pratipaadit pariklpana hoti he
 Based on the above information and overtime average expense or cost realization ratio per employee, a project manager can estimate: kisi pariyojna athwa pranali main jokhim yaa to vishesh kaaran parivartan athwa saamaanya kaaran parivartan ke kaaran hote hai or unhen uchit upachaar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 That is to reiterate the concern for the irrelevant external causes mentioned in the above list
 pariyojna prabandhan main jokhim prabandhan kii nimnlikhit gatividhiyaan shaamil hoti hai: Risk management is simply a method of systematically selecting cost-effective proposals to reduce the risk of risk to an organization
 sabhi jokhimon kii puri tarah upeksha athwa newnikaran keval aarthik or vyaavhaarik simaaon ke kaaran nahin kii ja sakati he
 Therefore all institutions have to accept some level of residual risks
 jabaki jokhim prabandhan purvakray abhimukhi hota he, vyapaar nirantarata yojana kaa avishkaar anubhoot avshisht jokhimon ke parinaamon se nipatane ke liye kiya gaya tha
 The need to place the BCP in the right place arises because unlikely events can occur if given sufficient time
 aksar jokhim prabandhan or BCP ko bhul se ek duusare ke pratidwandvi athwa ativyapi karypranaliyon ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 In fact, these processes are so tightly tied to each other that such separation seems artificial
 udhaaharan ke liye, jokhim prabandhan kii prakriya BCP ke liye mahatvapurn niveshon kii sristi karti he
 Risk management also proposes applicable controls for observed risks
 isliye, jokhim prabandhan kai aise kshetron ko shaamil karti hai jo BCP pranali ke liye mahatvapurn hoti hai
 However, the BCP process moves out of the pre-emptive approach of risk management, moving beyond the prediction that an accident will occur at some point
 jokhim sanchaar ek jatil paar anushaasanic academik kshetra he
 The only problem for risk communicators is how to reach the intended audience / audience so that the risk is understandable and relevant compared to other risks, how to appropriately respect the values of the audience related to the risk, the audience for the communication How to predict the reaction of, etc
 The major goal of risk communication is to improve collective and individual decision making
 Risk communication is somewhat related to crisis communication

 Accepting Muhammad as the last messenger of Allah is one of the central beliefs of Islam
 Shahada is a basic Islamic practice that proclaims that Allah is One, and Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam is the apostle sent by Allah
 This declaration is subtly like this: "la Ilaha Ilallah Muhammadun Rasulullah" means "there are no Mabuds, except Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah"
 In passages such as 3: 132, 48:29 and 66: 1 in the Quran, Muhammad is called Rasul, Prophet, and the Quran asks people to follow them, allowing each person to attain the Hayat and finally the success

 In childhood, he was called by two names, his mother used to call him Muhammad and grandfather Abdul Muttalib called him Ahmed
 He was a member of the Banu Hashim clan, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Qureshi tribe
 According to Islamic books, before the birth of Muhammad, his mother had seen many spasms, in which he was told about his godliness and spiritual significance
 One of them is the following: "ootiyat ummuhu fil manaami faki-l laha annaki ha-m-lat sayyidal aalami-na va kheral variyati fa-sammihu mohammadan ija va-ja-atahu satu hmdu biha0" Muhammad was orphaned at a young age
 a few months before the birth of Hazrat, Hazrat Abdullah left for Palestine and al-sham with a trading caravan
 Due to the difficult journey and illness, he stayed for rest in the last leg of the journey, the village of his paternal grandmother Salma Bint Amr, who was in Medina, and the convoy left him behind and left for Mecca City
 After receiving news of Abdullah's illness by the caravan, Hazrat Abdul Mutallib sent his elder son al-harit to Medina, but after leaving there al-harit learned that his brother had died a month after the illness
 , And was buried at darun-nabiya

 The H
264 / AVC project was originally intended to produce a standard capable of delivering good quality video at a lower bit rate than the previous standard, as well as building without increasing the complexity of its design to make it impractical or applicable
 Do not be too expensive to do
 An additional goal was to allow sufficient flexibility to implement a wide range of applications across a wide range of networks and systems including low and high bit rates, low and high resolution video, broadcast, DVD storage, Includes RTP / IP packet network and ITU-T multimedia telephony systems
 H
264 maanak ko "maanakon ke parivaar" ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jo sadasyon kii profile ke neeche varnit he
 a specific decoder decodes at least one, but not all profiles are required
 vicodak vinirdesan jis profile kaa varnan karata he use dicode kiya ja saktaa he
 This H
264 name follows the ITU-T naming convention where the standard VCEG is a member of the H
26x video coding standard; The name MPEG-4 AVC refers to the naming convention in ISO / IEC MPEG where the standard is part 10 of ISO / IEC 14496 which is the suite of standards as MPEG-4
 is maanak ko sanyukt rup se VCEG or empiiji kii bhagidaari main viksit kiya gaya tha, VCEG pariyojna ke rup main itiu-tii main praarambhik vikaas kaary ke baad pariyojna ko H

 It commonly referred to the standard with names such as H
264 / AVC, AVC / H
264, H
264 / MPEG-4 AVC, or MPEG-4 / H
264 AVC to emphasize simple inheritance
 Gone

 Some software programs identify the standard internally as AVC1
 H
264 / AVC ke pehle sanskaran ke maanakeekaran ko may 2003 main puraa kiya gaya
 In the first project to expand the original standard, the development that JVT did at the time was called the Fidelity Range Extension
 is ekstansion ne ucch gunvattta video ko sakasham kiya jo ki gaharaai sahit namoona bit ke vruddhi main samarthan or ucchtam-rejulushan color soochna ke dwaara koden kiya jisamen namoona-chayan sanrachana shaamil tha jise y'cbcr 4:2:2 or y'cbcr 4:4:4 ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Several other features were also included in the Fidelity Range Extension project such as adaptive switching between 4 × 4 and 8 × 8 integer shifts, encoder-specified perceptual-based quantization load matrices, lossless efficient inter-image coding, and additional color support
 
 The design work on the Fidelity Range Extension was completed in July 2004 and the drafting work on them was completed in September 2004
 baad main maanak ke aage ke vistaar main vyavsaayik anuprayogon ke liye mukhya rup se paanch anya nai profile ko jodna, vistaarit-sargam rang spes samarthan ko jodna, atirikt pahalu anupaat sanketakon ko paribhaashit karnaa, "poorak jaankaree vruddhi" ke do atirikt prakaaron kii vyakhya or purv ke frext profile ko anuchit tehraana jo ki udyog pratikriya ko suchit karti he ki ek alag tarah se dizin hona chahie, shaamil he
 Another key feature added to the standard was scalable video coding
 H
264 / AVC ke eneks ji main nirdisht SVC bitstream ke nirmaan kii anumati detii he jisamen sab-bitstream shaamil hote hai or vah bhi maanak ke liye anuroop hota he, aise ek bitstream ko "aadhaar parat" ke rup main janaa jaataa he jise ek H
264 / AVC dwaara dicode kiya ja saktaa he or yah SVC ko saport nahin karti he
 Periodic bitstream scalability, that is, the presence of sub-bitstreams with short time sampling rates compared to bitstreams, when the sub-bitstreams are generated, the entire access unit is removed from the bitstream
 is maamle main, bitstream main ucch str ke vaakyavinyas or antar bhavishyaatmak sandarbh tasveeron ko tadnusaar nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 For spatial and quality measurement, ie the presence of sub-bitstreams with lower spatial resolution or quality than bitstreams, sub-bitstreams are generated when NAL is removed from the bitstreams
 is maamle main, antar-parat prediction, yani, nimna sthanik rejulushan yaa gunvattta signal ke data dwaara ucch sthanik rejulushan yaa gunvattta signal ke prediction, aam taur par kushal koden ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 The scalable video coding extension was completed in November 2007
 maanak main judi agali pramukh visheshta multivue video koding tha
 Specified in Annex h of H
264 / AVC, MVC enables the creation of bitstreams that represent more than one view of a video scene
 is kaaryashiltaa ke ek mahatvapurn udhaaharan stiroscopy 3D video koden he
 Two profiles have been developed in MVC work: multiview high profiles, supporting an arbitrary number of views, and stereo high profiles designed specifically for two-view stereoscopic video
 multivue video koding ekstansion ko november 2009 main puraa kiya gaya
 In early 1998 the video coding expert group released a project proposal called H
26L and aimed to replicate its coding efficiency compared to any other existing video coding standard for a variety of applications

 This standard specifies 17 set capabilities in which specific classes of applications are targeted, referred to as profiles
 gaiyr-maapan 2di video anuprayogon ke liye nimnlikhit profile shaamil hai: 2: 2 profiles: primarily targeted to commercial applications that are used for video interchange, builds this profile on top of the High 10 profile, adding support for the 4: 2: 2 chroma subsampling format, while The decode uses up to 10 bits per sample for photo precision
 4 : 4 purvanumaan profile : is profile ko hai 4:2:2 ke sheersh par banaaya jaataa he, 4:4:4 chroma sampling tak saport karata he, prati sample 14 bit tak kaa istemaal karata he or atirikt taur par kushal dosharahit kshetra koding ko saport karata he or teen alag-alag rang vimaanon ke rup main prayek chitra kaa koden karata he
 For camcorders, editing, and professional applications, the standard includes four additional all-intra profiles, defined as simple subsets of other homogenous profiles
 ye zyaadaatar profeshnal anuprayogon ke liye hote hai: 2: 2 intra profile: High 4: 2: 2 profile is constrained for all-intra use
 4 : 4 intra profile: ol-intra istemaal ke liye 4:4:4 profile vivash he
 4: 4 Intra Profile: High 4: 4: 4 constrained profile for all-intra experiment and CAVLC entropy coding

 As a result of the multiview video coding expansion, the standard includes two multiview profiles: jaisaa ki maanak main ek pad "level " kaa upyog hota he, jo ki vistrut vivaran kaa ek set hota or ek profile ke liye aavashyak dicoder pradarshan kii degree ko suchit karata he
 For example, the level of support within a profile would specify the maximum resolution picture, frame rate, and bit rate that a decoder may be able to use
 ek vicodak jo praapt level ko sweekruti dete hanki kisi die str ke anuroop karne ke liye sabhi bitstream ki us str ke liye or sabhi staron ke liye kam incode decoding main sakasham hona aavashyak he

 For example, for an HDTV picture there are 1920 wide samples and 1080 high samples, the Laver 4 decoder has a maximum DPB storage capacity) = 4 frames when encoding with the minimum cropping parameter value
 is prakaar, mulya 4 talika main koshthkon main str 4 ke liye pankti kaa sahi frem 1080 1920 × aakaar ke saath stambh main upar dikhaaya gaya he
 It is important to note that the existing decoded picture is not included in the computation of the DPB calculation
 Thus, a decoder actually needs to have enough memory to handle a frame that exceeds the dpb's maximum capacity, as calculated above

 Its three branches are famous by the names of Auaghar, Sarabhangi and Ghurre, the first of which was Kallusinh and Kaluram, who was the guru of Baba Kinaram
 kuch log is panth ko guru gorakhnath ke bhi pehle se prachlit batalaate hai or iskaa sambandh shaiva mat ke pashupat athwa kalamukh sampradaay ke saath jodate hai
 Baba Kinaram Aghori was born in the village of Samagarh in present-day Benaras district and lived in a depressed sense since childhood
 inhone pehle baba shivaraam vaishnav se diksha lee thi, kintu ve phir girnaar ke kisi mahatma dwaara bhi prabhavit ho gaye

 gautam dharmasutra ab tak uplabdh dharmasutron main pracheenatam he
 Although all Dharmasutra texts are generally accepted by the entire Aryan without any branching, Gautama Dharmasutra and Gobhil Grihyasutra according to Kumaril are exclusively acquired by the scholars
 gautam dharmasutra ke aantarik sakshya se kumaril ke mat kii pushti hoti he
 The entire 26th chapter of this book is adapted from the Brahmin Samvadhana of Samaveda
 samavedic gobhilgriysutra main gautam ke pramaanon ke uddhran hai
 According to tradition, Gautama was a sutracharan of Samaveda, the branch of Ranayya, and probably Gautam Dharmasutra was composed in this sutracharan
 yah kalpana bhi durarudh nahin ki dharmasutra ke atirikt gautamasutracharan ke grihy or shrautastr the jo ab uplabdh nahin
 There are 28 chapters in this Dharmasutra discussing Samyavadi or Smarta Dharma, in which the Varna, Ashram and Nimrita religions have detailed and supposedly brief legislation
 dharmapramaan, pramaanon kaa paurvapary, upanayan, shouch, brahmacharee, bhikshu or baikhanas ashramon kii vidhi, grihasthashram se sambhddha sanskaar or kartavya, brahman, kshatriya, vaisya or shudra ke kartavya, rajdharm, dand, shouch, stridharm, praayshchitt, daybhag evam putron ke prakaar kaa vivechan he
 The available form of this Dharmasutra is composed of many projections
 udhaaharan ke liye 19wein adhyay main karmvipak kaa ansh baad main joda gaya he
 Neither Muskari's commentary nor Hardatta's interpretation of it
 boudhayan dwaara uddhrut gautamadharmasutra ke vachan tathaa prastut dharmasutra ke aantarik sakshya par adhyay 6 kaa chatha sutara bhi parvarti prakshep prathit hota he
 It does not have interstitial footsteps like other Dharmasutras
 sampurna gautamadharmasutra gadhy main he, yadhyapi kuch sutara vattagandhistylee main likhe gaye hai or anushtup ke ansh prathit hote hai, anya dharmasutron kii apeksha isaki bhashaa panineey vyakaran kii adhik anuyaayini he, kintu yah sanskaar bhi baad kaa prathit hota he
 Since this Dharmasutra is a part of Samvidhana Brahmana and the Vashistha and Boudhayana Dharmasutras mention the names of this Dharmasutra, so it must have been composed after Samvidhamana Brahman and before Vasistha and Boudhayanadharmasutra
 is tathy tathaa buddha dharm ke dwaara kii gai varnashram dharm kii aalochana ke anullekh tathaa uski pratyaalochan ke abhaav ke aadhaar par is dharmasutra kaa rachanakaal 600-400 i

 To this is the "mitakshara" interpretation of Hardatta and the "commentary" of Muskari
 gautam dharmasutra ke rachiyata rishi gautam muni maane jate hai
 The mention of the name Gautama is found in many of the ancient scriptures
 yatha nyaay darshan ke praneta bhi akshapaad gautam maane jate hai
 In the Kathopanishad, Gautama is used for Nachiketa and his father Vajashravas
 isi prakaar chaandogya upanishad* main haridrum naam ke acharya kaa ullekh hua he
 The Atharvaveda * also has the name Gautama

 Who among them practiced the Dharmasutra is uncertain
