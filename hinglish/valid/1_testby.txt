 gujarat main vidhansabha chunaav kaa bigul baj chukaa he
 Both major parties have started work on their strategy
 is bich congress ne rashtravaadi congress party (NCP) ke saath milakar chunaav ladane se inkaar kar diya he
 Gujarat Congress President Bharat Singh Solanki said on Wednesday that the Congress will not form an alliance with NCP in the upcoming assembly elections
 solanki ne ensipi ko bijepi kii bi-party bataate hue ye elaan kiya
 But the big question is whether the Congress not going to the elections with the NCP can harm it? Or will there be a Surat that can play a role in furthering the bjp's winning chariot? An even bigger question is whether the NCP is so powerful in Gujarat that it can affect the election results? If we look at the data of the assembly election results, the picture looks bleak
 ensipi kii sthapana 1999 main hui or party ne gujarat main 2002 kaa vidhansabha chunaav ladaa
 The NCP contested 81 seats, out of which its candidates lost their deposits on 77 seats
 ensipi ko mahaj 1
 71 percent of the vote was received
 2007 main milin 2 seat2007 vidhansabha chunaav main ek baar phir ensipi ne haath aajamaaya
 In this election the NCP fielded candidates for only 10 seats and the party performed better
 ensipi ummidavaaron ko kul 1
 65 per cent of the votes and 3 party mlas won
 iske baad 2012 vidhansabha chunaav main ensipi kii parmormens main giravat ai or mahaj 0
 Got 95 percent of the vote
 is chunaav main ensipi ko 2 siten milin
 It is clear from the data that NCP is very weak in the 182-member Gujarat Assembly
 magar, party zyada se zyada siton par chunaav ladane kii koshish karti he
 The Congress is out of power in Gujarat for 20 years, in such a situation, if it contests with the NCP, then it is possible that there will be some increase in the vote share and seats of the party
 haalanki, 1995 main satta se bedakhal hone ke baad congress ab tak 60 siton kaa aankada bhi nahin chhu pai he
 In such a situation, the support of 2 or 3 seats of NCP can also make it reach the peak of power, it does not seem possible
 agar, bijepi ko ensipi ke samarthan kaa anumaan lagaaya jaae to aisi sthiti main wo bijepi ke liye bonus sabit ho saktaa he
 In the recent Rajya Sabha election, an NCP MLA claimed to vote for the BJP candidate
 vahiin gujarat main ensipi kaa ateet bhi bijepi kii taraf jhukaa najar aata he
 Therefore, if the NCP comes to the election summer, even in the form of team-b, not directly in the coalition, it will prove beneficial for the BJP
 gujarat main ensipi ke alaava jediu,gujarat parivartan party or bahujan samaaj partybhi badi sankhya main siton par haath aajamaati hai
 If we look at the figures of these three parties, the number of seats is negligible, but the vote percentage can affect the results of any party in both
 pichley chunaav main gujarat parivartan party ne 3
 63 per cent and Bahujan Samaj Party 1

 JDU is just 0

 Questioning the sp's' Muslim love ', the Congress General Secretary said,' Mulayam Singh says that Congress gave lesser reservation to Muslims
 vah khud teen baar rajya ke mukhyamantri rahe lekin unhone apane str se is disha main kuch nahin kiya
 While denying Yadav's promise about Muslim reservation, Rahul said, "mulayam Singh says he will give 28 percent reservation
" ucchtam nyaayalay ne kaha he ki itnaa aarakshan nahin diya ja saktaa lekin mulaayam kah rahe hai ki vah denge

 Film Name: Mohenjo Darodirector: Ashutosh Gowariker: Star Cast: Hrithik Roshan, Pooja Hegde, Kabir Bedi, Arunoday Singh, Nitish Bhardwaj, Narendra Jha, Manish Chaudhary: Rating: 1 Starritik Roshan and director Ashutosh Gowariker pair super hit film 'jodha' Akbar is ready once again
 haalanki ashutosh kii pichhali film 'khelen ham ji jaan se' se box offis par flop sabit hui thi or rithik kii pichhali film'baing baing'bhi kuch khaas karaamaat nahin dikhaa pai
 Now it will have to be seen whether the two together can play any magic again in 'mohenjo Daro'
 aaie jaanate hai aakhir kisi he yah film:kahani:kahani ghisipity he
 a rich boy who wants to leave his village and go to Mohenjo Daro because that city and its related things come in his dreams
 aakhirkaar apane kaaka ko manaakar wo shahar pahunchataa he or vahiin uski mulaakaat heroin se bhi hoti he or prem kahani ke saath use pataa chalata he ki mohanejo daaro kaa mahant hi uske pita kaa kaatil he
 He takes revenge on those who were against his father and wins everyone's heart with the heroine
 screenple:film kaa screenple behad kamjor he
 The first part does not even end
 interval ke pehle prem kahani or interval ke baad badla, naa prem kahani main koi dam he or badla bhi behad ghisapita he
 There is a fighting scene with the crocodile to show the hero's bravery with the songs
 ek villen ke bete ke saath, ek fite do aadam khor pahalawaanon ke saath or aakhri fite main villen ke saath yani gane or fite baraabar se rakhe gaye hai
 Then the heroic comedian friend of a hero, a friend of his with Heroine, an unworthy bloodthirsty son of Maine Villain and the honest priestly father of Heroine who is ultimately killed
 60 ke dashak kaa har masala 'mohenjo daaro' main he
 It is not believed that this is Ashutosh Gowariker's film which made 'lagaan'
 unki aakhri film 'khelen ham ji jaan se' bhi behad kharaab film thi
 Instead of making a big film, Ashutosh tries to make a good story, it will be better for him and for his producer too
 abhinay:rithik roshan kii chaal or andaaj aaj ke jamaane ke hisaab se he
 The style of speaking dialog is initially unbroken, then becomes habitual
 is film main rithik ke alaava koi bhi chhap nahin chhod paaya
 Pooja Hegde was seen doing well according to the first film
 baaki kabir bedi or arun udai singh jabardastee ke munh banaakar bhayanak banane kii bekaar koshish karte rahete hai
 There is no such artist in the film who can remember

 The Supreme Court on Thursday asked Janata Party chief Subrahmanyam Swamy to hand over all the letters written by him to the CBI seeking an inquiry into the alleged role of Home Minister p Chidambaram in the 2G spectrum allocation scam
 nyaayalay ne kaha ki pehle vah un dastavejon kaa adhyayan karegaa or uske baad jarurat padane par sibiai or sarkaar se jawaab maangega
 a bench of Justice GS Singhvi and Justice AK Ganguly said, "please record any correspondence you have with the CBI
" peeth ne swami se kaha ki vah ek hafte ke bheetar sabhi praasangik dastavejon or chidambaram kii kathith bhoomika kii jaanch kii maang ko lekar sibiai nideshak ke saath kiye gaye patrachaar ke saath halafanama daayar karen
 The government, however, strongly denied Swamy's plea that if he had any evidence, he should place it before the CBI, which is investigating the case
 centre kii ore se varisht adhivaktaa pi pi raav ne kaha, ucchtam nyaayalay main sidhe aane kii bajaay unhen sibiai ke paas janaa chahie
 He said, whatever evidence is there should be placed before the agency
 raav ne peeth se is tarah kii yachikaaon par sunwaayee nahin karne ko kaha
 He said, CBI has already investigated the case and found nothing
 meri aakshamata he ki main sibiai nahin hum
 i cannot say anything until i get a CBI report
 yah sibiai ko aapako kahana he
 The bench, however, objected to his pleas, saying, "do we have any such rule that if an application is filed and allegations are made then it cannot be placed before us
" swami ne apni daleel main kaha ki 2 ji spectrum kii keemat tatkaaleen doorsanchaar mantri e raja or tatkaaleen vitt mantri pi chidambaram ne nirdhaarit kii thi or agency dwaara unki bhoomika kii jaanch kii jaani chahie
 Swamy said, there is a lot of evidence about his (chidambaram) involvement in the price of spectrum
 raja is mudde par salaakhon ke peeche hai
 Therefore, there should be a proper investigation against Chidambaram
 swami ne kaha, unhone sibiai ko likhaa tha or ek shikaayat darj karai thi lekin aisa lagata he ki sibiai chindbaram se poochtacha karne main sankoch kar rahi he
 Swamy said that the spectrum pricing formula was to be finalized jointly by the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Finance under the 2003 decision of the Empowered Group of Ministers
 unhone kaha ki jab spectrum aavanton kiya gaya tha to chidambaram vitt mantri the
 He said, the formula for the price of spectrum would not be valid and binding unless both the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Finance agreed
 unhone kaha ki isliye, pravesh shulk kaa punarikshan nahin kar sarkari khajaane ko chapat lagane ke aarope kii puri jaanch or javabdehi nirdhaarit karne ke liye chidambaram se poochtacha or uske baad unke jawaab kaa moolyankan karnaa aavashyak he

 agar aapane online shopping karke mobile yaa koi doosraa saamaan kharida he or vah kharaab he yaa online company kii ore se koi doosraa saamaan mil gaya he, to aap kanoon kaa sahaara lekar sahi saamaan yaa rakam waapas paa sakate hai
 For this the Indian Parliament enacted the Consumer Protection Act in 1986
 iske tahat har kanjumar kaa yah adhikaar he ki usne paise dekar jis saamaan ko kharida he, wo usko ekadam durust haalat main mili
 Apart from this, if there is any problem during the warranty or the guarantee period, then it should be repaired or replaced with a new one
 agar koi dukandaar, saplir yaa company aapako kharaab saamaan yaa sarvice detii he, to usko fouran durust karnaa hoga yaa phir badalakar dena hoga
 Apart from this, if you shopped online and got any other goods from the company, then it will be the responsibility of the company to change it
 maan lijie ki agar aapane koi mobile online site par jaakar kharida he or company ne mobile kii jagah pathar bharkar aapke pate par bhej diya, to company ko badalakar dobaaraa mobile dena hoga
 If the company does not do this, you can make a complaint in the Consumer Forum
 kanjumar protection act 1986 main aise maamalon kii sunwaayee ke liye teen stareey kanjumar court banaai gai hai
 If a case is worth up to Rs 20 lakh, you can make a complaint in the District Consumer Forum
 agar maamla 20 lakh se zyada or ek karod rupee se kam kaa he, to aap rajya kanjumar kamishan main cese kar sakate hai
 Apart from this, if the value of the goods or service purchased is more than one crore rupees, then you can go directly to the National Consumer Commission
 vahiin, agar aapane kisi maamle kii shikaayat jila kanjumar forum main kii he or uske faisle se santusht nahin he, to aap state kanjumar kamishan or uske baad neshnal kanjumar kamishan ja sakate hai
 Which district's consumer forum can complain 1
 us jile ke kanjumar forum main jahaan peedit paksh yaa vipakshi rahata ho yaa uskaa koi karyaalay ho
 2
 jahaan se aapane saamaan yaa seva kharidi ho, us jile ke kanjumar forum main
 3
 jahaan par company yaa kisi dukaan kaa mukhyalay ho jiske khilaaf aap cese kar rahe hai
 Who can do case 1
 jisane koi saamaan yaa seva paise dekar kharidi ho
 If there is a deficiency in service or goods, it can file a case
 haalanki agar koi saamaan yaa seva ko bechney ke liye kharidta he, to vah is kanoon ke tahat cese nahin kar saktaa he
 This means that if a retailer buys an item from a wholesaler, it will not be treated as a consumer under this law and cannot make a case
 2
 If a company has bought goods or services and is being consumed by itself or its employees, then it can file a case under this law
 3
 Any heir to a consumer or to whom the consumer has given the goods or service as a gift can file a case on behalf of the buyer
 4
 Apart from this, the state government and the central government can also file cases in such cases
 shikaayat karne ke sabase aasaan tareeke1

 Consumers can also complain by sending an SMS to the number 8130009809
 esemes milane ke baad kanjumar ko phone kiya jayega or uski shikaayat darj kii jaaegi
 What are consumer rights suraksha kaa adhikaar yani sahi vastuon or sevaaon ko paane kaa adhikaar he
 If an item or service is hazardous to the life and property of the consumer, then he has the right to get protection against it
 2
 The right to information means that the consumer has the right to get information about the quality, quantity, power, purity, standard and price of goods and services
 iskaa matlab yah he ki agar koi dukandaar yaa saplir yaa phir company aapako kisi vastu yaa saamaan kii sahi jaankaree nahin detii he, to uske khilaaf aap cese kar sakate hai
 3
 chunane kaa adhikaar yani kanjumar ko vastuon or sevaaon ko chunane kaa adhikaar he
 He can choose the service or item of his choice
 kisi bhi kanjumar ko koi vishesh vastu yaa seva lene ke liye baadhya nahin kiya jayega

 They face Bangla Tigers on Wednesday and that too at their home
 phir bhi bharat kii jeet ko lekar zyaadaatar jaankaar aashwast najar aa rahe hai
 Team director Ravi Shastri has advised the team that 'winning is a habit' and Team India should maintain this rhythm in the Asia Cup
 ravi shastri ye bhi kehete hai team india ke liye bangladesh main asia cap kaa har match ahm he
 They want Team India to win all the matches in Bangladesh
 bharat ko 24 farvari ko bangladesh, 27 farvari ko pakistan, 1 march ko srilanka or 3 march ko sanyukt arab emirate ke saath match khelnaa he
 India will need to be vigilant even when using at least three of these matches
 isisi ranking main team india naa keval world number van he, balki maujuuda form main koi bhi team use aasaan nahin aank sakati
 India has played two T20 matches against Bangladesh so far and donon main use jeet hasil hui he
 India have won 4 out of 6 matches against Pakistan, one match being tie while in one match they lost
 dephending champion srilanka ke khilaaf India won 5 out of 9 matches, while four had to face it
 world ranking main 15wein number kii team sanyukt arab emirate or bharat ke bich tii-20 match kaa khaataa khulanaa baaki he
 So Shastri who is expecting from Team India is not like gaining the moon
 ravi shastri team ko salaah dete hai ki use apni takat par focus karnaa chahie, atiaatmavishvaas or susti se bachanaa chahie
 Despite defeating Australia 3–0 against Sri Lanka (india comments 2-1 se jeeta) bhartiya team inhen kamiyon kii vajah se pehla match haar gai thi
 Now there is no scope before the World Cup
 shastri ne team ko is baat kii bhi parvaah nahin karne ko kaha ki vahaan pichen kisi milengi
 Shastri also tells the story of the time passed by Bangladesh in the ODI team of India 8 months ago and believes that there is no need to worry about it
 baavjood in sabake ye saafe he ki bangladesh main team india prayog bhi karegi taaki world tii 20 main team india apane best balance ke saath kitaab kaa peechha kare
 Ravi Shastri also says that every match of the Asia Cup in Bangladesh is important for Team India
 wo chaahate hai ki bangladesh main team india sabhi maichon main jeet hasil kare
 India has to play matches with Bangladesh on 24 February, Pakistan on 27 February, Sri Lanka on 1 March and the United Arab Emirates on 3 March
 inamen se kam se kam teen maichon main bharat ko prayog karte hue bhi chaukanna rahane kii jarurat hogi
 Team India is not only the world number one in the ICC rankings, but no team in the current form can make it easy
 bangladesh ke khilaaf bharat ne ab tak do tii-20 match khele hai or He has won both
 pakistan ke khilaaf bharat ne 6 main se 4 match jite hai, ek match taai rahaa jabaki ek match main use haar kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Defending champion against Sri Lanka bharat ne 9 main se 5 maichon main jeet hasil kii, jabaki chaar main use munh kii khaani padi
 The account of the T20 match between UAE and India, the number 15 team in the world rankings, is yet to open
 isliye shastri jo team india se ummid rakh rahe hai wo chand hasil karne jaisaa nahin he
 Ravi Shastri advises the team that it should focus on its strengths, avoid overconfidence and lethargy
 australia ko 3-0 se haraane ke baavjood srilanka ke khilaaf (bharattippaniyan Won 2–1) The Indian team lost the first match due to these deficiencies
 world cap se pehle ab isaki gunjaaish nahin he
 Shastri told the team not to care about how the pitches would get there
 8 maheene pehle team india kii vanade main bangladesh ke haathon 1-2 se hui haar ko bhi shastri gujarey hue vakt kii kahani kehete hai or maanate hai ki use lekar fikr karne kii zarurat nahin
 Despite all this, it is clear that Team India will also experiment in Bangladesh so that in the World T20, Team India will chase the title with its best balance

 Opposition RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tivary, in a statement, has advised Prashant Kishore to leave Janata Dal United
 shivanand tiwari ne fasebuk par saajha kii gai ek post main likhaa he ki 'prashanth kishor nitish kumaar (nitish Kumar) ke saath tik nahin paaenge
 i have known Nitishji for a long time, he cannot tolerate any self-respecting and independent-minded person around him
 'shivanand ne kaha he ki 'prashanth ko maine suna or padhaa he
 He has his own well-known opinion on every issue
 unki har raay nitish ji kii raay se mail khaae yah jaruri nahin he
 But Prashant keeps his point very frank, the mess is here
 nitish ji se alag raay rakhkar aap unke saath nahin rah sakate hai
 If you keep, then you cannot reveal it
 prashanth agar nitish ji se alag hatate hai to isse unako koi haani pahunchane vaali nahin he
 Prashant's name and fame has spread far and wide
 isliye kahin bhi unka swaagat hoga
 'tiwari has said that' i will have only one request from him
 vah bhi isliye ki karm ke str par ve chunaav ke saath bahut najadik se jude rahe hai
 Therefore, elections should be made in the country only through elections, they will definitely have loyalty to it
 aaj ve jin logon ke saath hai unka loktantr main yakeen nahin he
 If they just live, today they will remove democracy from the country
 unmaad kaa maahaul paidaa kar roji, roti, rojgaar, kisaani aadi kii samasyaon se logon kaa dhyaan bhatkaakar ve satta hasil karnaa chaahate hai
 'shivanand Tiwari has said that' an atmosphere of frenzy is being created in the name of patriotism
 kisi bhi tarah ke sawaal ko deshadroh bataaya ja rahaa he
 So my request to Prashant ji would be to leave them
 inase ladane vaali kisi bhi party se judie or loktantr ko bachaane ke nek or pavitra abhiyaan main apana kandhaa lagaaie
