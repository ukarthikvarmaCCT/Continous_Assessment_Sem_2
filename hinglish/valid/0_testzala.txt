 To bring these new words to folk use, extra-grammatical grammars were composed
 kuch vyakaran granthon kaa pranayan sanskrit vyakaran ko saralatam bhang se shikshaarthiyon ko sikhaane ke liye hua or kuch granth bahut vishalkay bane, jinamein panini se lekar us samay tak bhashaa kii pragati main aae shabdon kaa vivaran tha
 In the later times, although the creators made every effort to bring perfection in their texts and practiced their scriptures in view of the usefulness of the scriptures in the prehistoric conditions, no grammatology could transcend the Pannee Ashtadhyayi
 paninietar vyakaranon kaa ekmaatr uddeshy tha saral style main vyakaran kii clishtataa tathaa jatilta ko dur karnaa

 The new poem was written after the Indian independence, in which new values and new crafts-legislation were explored, along with the expression of new sentiments beyond traditional poetry
 yah bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki prayogwaad ke baad hindi kavita kii jo naveen dhara viksit hui, vah nai kavita he
 The name New Poetry became an impetus for those poems written after independence, which are distinctive even in the development of progressivism and experimentalism in both their object and image
 nayi kavita-andolan kaa aarambh elahabaad kii saahitiyik sanstha parimal ke kavi lekhakon- jagadish gupt, ramswarup chaturvedi or vijayadevanrayan saahi ke sampadan main 1954 main prakashit "nayi kavita" patrika se mana jaataa he
 Earlier, the role of the second collection of poetry collection published in the editing of Agyeya and the statements of some poets included in it the term 'new poem' for their poets was accepted
 nayi kavita ke liye jagat-jivan se sambandhit koi bhi sthiti, sambandh, bhav yaa vichaar kathy ke rup main tyajya nahin he
 The new poem has expressed the conditions, situations, relationships, feelings, thoughts and actions of today's human life from birth to death
 nae kavi ne kisi bhi kathy ko tyajya nahin samajha he
 There is a request for self-realization in the new poem about the story
 nayaa kavi apane kathy ko usee rup main prastut karnaa chahta he, jis rup main use vah anubhoot karata he
 The new poem is a poem of liberation
 isse pehle ke kavi bhi praayah kisi na kisi vaad kaa sahaara avashya lete the
 And if the poet does not care about the debate, but the critic used to search for the debate before poetry in his creation - the poetry used to examine poetry
 kintu nayi kavita kii sthiti bhinn he
 The new poet is not ready to fall into the fanaticism of any doctrine, schism, sect or urge of vision
 sankshep main, nayi kavita koi vaad nahin he, jo apane kathy or drushti main simit ho
 The comprehensiveness of the story and the liberation of the creation are the greatest features of the new poem
 nai kavita parampara ko nahin maanati
 Humans have individual differences, there are good as well as evils
 nai kavita ke kavi ko manushya in sabhi roopon main pyaara he
 His purpose is to depict the totality of man
 nai kavita jivan ke prati aasthaa kii rakhti he
 Today's momentary and miniaturist vision is an acceptable view of life-values
 nai kavita main jivan kaa purna sweekaar karke use bhogane kii laalasaa he
 To accept each and every feeling of life, agony, happiness, truth, and to accept life intensively is to accept forgiveness as truth
 nai kavita ne jivan ko na to ekangi rup main dekha na keval mahat rup main, usne jivan ko jivan ke rup main dekha
 It did not set any limit
 jaise- dukh sabko maanjata he or, chaahe swayan sabko mukti dena na jane, kintu-jisko maanjata he, unhen yah sikh detaa he ki, sabko mukt rakhen
 There are two main elements in the new poem - truth of cognition and intelligent realist vision
 vah anubhuti kshan kii ho yaa ek samooche kaal kii, kisi saamaanya vyakti kii ho yaa vishisht purush kii, aashaa kii ho yaa niraashaa kii, apni sachai main kavita ke liye or jivan ke liye bhi amuly he
 Rationalism in the new poem is also in the form of new realistic vision and as an identity of new life-consciousness
 yahi kaaran he ki tatasth prayogshiltaa nai kavita ke kathy or style-donon kii visheshta he
 The new poet has a neutral attitude towards his narrative, as he tries to remain free from promises
 is visheshta ke kaaran nai kavita main kathyon kii koi ek paridhi nahin he
 In this, new layers of story come out of it
 kabhi-kabhi vah apane hi kathanon kaa khandan bhi kar detaa he- eemaandaaree ke kaaran
 The new poet suffers by drowning, but does not drown while undergoing
 nai kavita jivan ke ek-ek kshan ko satya maanati he or us satya ko puri hardikta or puri chetana se bhogane kaa samarthan karti he
 The truth of cognition, the more it is able to take, the more it is true for its poetry
 nai kavita anubhutipurna gahare kshanon, prasangon, vyapaar yaa kisi bhi satya ko uski aantarik maarmikata ke saath pakad lenaa chaahati he
 In this way, the simple business-related business or context finds new meaning in the new poem
 nai kavita main kshanon kii anubhutiyon ko lekar bahut-si marmasparshi kavitaayen likhi gai hai
 Which are small in size but very intense in effect
 nai kavita parampara ko nahin maanati
 These poets have opposed traditionalist inertia
 pragatisheel kaviyon ne parampara kii jadta kaa virodh isliye kiya he ki vah logon ko shoshan kaa shikaar banaati he or duniya ke mazdooron tathaa daliton ko ek jhande ke neeche ekatra hone main baadha daalati he
 The new poet opposes him because he is frustrated with human conscience
 nai kavita saamaajik yatharth tathaa usamen vyakti kii bhoomika ko parakhane kaa prayaas karti he
 Because of this, the new poem has a deep connection with social reality
 parantu nai kavita kii yathartwaadee drushti kaalpanik yaa adarshavaadi maanavvaad se santrusht na hokar jivan kaa mulya, uskaa saundarya, uskaa prakaash jivan main hi khojati he
 The new poem, Dwivedi, does not offer its ready-made value propositions like poetry, cinematography or progressivism, rather it wants to find it within the true agony of life
 isliye nai kavita main vyangy ke rup main kahin puraane mulyon kii asweekruti he, to kahin dard kii sachai ke bheetar se ugte hue nae mulyon kii sambhaavna ke prati aasthaa
 The new poem has challenged all kinds of values of religion, philosophy, policy, ethics
 nai kavita kaa swar apane parivesh kii jivananubhuti se phuta he
 The new poem has poets writing about both urban life and rural-life environments
 agyeya ne donon par likhaa he
 While Balakrishna Rao, Shamsher Bahadur Singh, Girijakumar Mathur, Kunvarnarayan Singh, Dharamvir Bharti, Prabhakar Machve, Vijaydevanarayan Sahi, Raghuveer Sahai, etc
 have the sensations and feelings of the poet in the urban environment, on the other hand Bhavniprasad Mishra, Kedarnath Singh, Shambhunath Singh, Thakur Prasad Singh, Thakur Prasad Singh Nagarjuna, Kedarnath Agarwal etc
 are poets who are basically associated with the sensations and sensations of the village
 inke atirikt usamen jahaan ghutan, vyarthta, ub, paraajay, hin-bhav, aakrosh hai, vahiin atmpeedan parak bhavanaayen bhi hai
 The ambience of the new poem is its life here
 kintu us par akshep he ki usamen atirikt anasthaa, niraashaa, vyaktivaadee kuntha or marandharmita he jo pashchim kii nakal se paidaa hui he
 In the new poem, suffering and despair are not considered as a side of life at some places, but it is taken as the whole life-truth
 vahaan pidaa jivan kii sarjanaatmak shakti na banakar use gatiheen karanevaali baadha batch gai he
 Public prosperity is a special feature of the new poem
 vah sahaj lok-jivan ke kareeb pahunchne kaa praytn kar rahi he
 Professor Mahavir Saran Jain, while reviewing the poems of Bhavani Prasad Mishra, states that "the biggest attack on the new Hindi poem is that it has extra dislocation, despair, hopelessness, frustration, frustration and deathliness
" usko padhane ke baad jeene kii lalak samaapt ho jaati he, vyakti hatotsahit ho jaataa he, man nirashaavadi or maranasann ho jaataa he
 That the new poem has accepted suffering, pain, grief and despair as the truth of life
 nai kavita bharat kii jameen se prerana praapt nahin karti
 On the contrary it is born out of imitation of the West
 bhavani prasad mishra kii kavitaayen in saare aaropon ko dhwast kar detii hai
 Mishra is a Gandhian
 gandhi kii desh-bhakthi manzil nahin he
 Gandhi's patriotism is a stop in his life journey to love and serve only the living beings of the world
 unke vichaar main kahin bhi lesh maatr bhi niraashaa kaa bhav nahin he
 The light of hope, faith and faith is highlighted in him
 isi alok ke kaaran gandhi ji ne dakshin-africa or bharat main jo jan-aandolan chalaae unhone sampoorn samaaj main nai jagriti, nai chetana or nayaa sankalp bhar diya
 His philosophy of life does not give rise to despair, despair and death-righteousness, but on the contrary, new hope, new faith and new zeal are born
 usase satya, ahimsa evam prem kii triveni pravaahit hoti he
 
 bhavani prasad mishra kii kavitaayen isi kaaran samaaj main jo vipann hai, laachaar hai, thake hue hai, dharashayi hai un sabko sahaara dene ke liye prerit karti hai, unako uthaane ke liye protsaahit karti hai"
 The new poem embraced the sensation, aesthetic sense, nature and questions of folk life on a simple and generous human land
 saath hi saath lok-jivan ke bimbon, pratikon, shabdon or upmaanon ko lok-jivan ke bich se chunakar usne apane ko atyadhik samvednapurna or sajiv banaaya
 The new poem cannot bear the overhead of the poem
 vah apni antarlay, bimbaatmakataa, naveen pratik-yojana, naye visheshnon ke prayog, naveen upmaan main kavita ke shilp kii maanya dharanaon se baaki alag he
 The language of the new poem does not work in any one way
 shashakt abhivyakti ke liye bolchaal kii bhashaa kaa prayog isamen adhik hua he
 In the new poem, not only Sanskrit words have been formed, but the prevalent words of different languages have been accepted
 nae shabd bhi bana liye gayi hai
 Toe, bhabhke, chhunna, whistle, chin, chuckle, chirpy, stump, virus, siraya, fungiana - many words are used indiscriminately in the new poem
 jisase isaki bhashaa main ek khulaapan or taazgi dikhaai detii he
 Its language also contains elements of folk language
 nai kavita main pratikon kii adhikta he
 Like - snake you have not been civilized, nor will you be, you have not come to settle in the city
 ek baat poonchhu? uttar doge! phir kaise siikhaa dansana? vish kahan paaya? nai kavita main bimb bhi vipul maatra main uplabdh he
 In the various compositions of the new poem, words, meanings, technicalities, free essays, daydreams, companionship, mythology, poetic images of nature have been created
 jaise- saamne mere sardi main bore ko odhakar, koi ek apane, haath pair samete, kaanp rahaa, hill rahaa,-vah mar jaayegaa
 In the new poem, the verses have received only a deep rejection - not only this, but various experiments have also been done in this field
 naye kaviyon main kisi bhi madhyam yaa shilp ke prati na to raag he or na viraag
 For the effect of dynamism, the new poetry has shifted to the change of sound by abandoning the rhythm of music
 ek varnya vishay yaa bhav ke sahare uskaa sangopang vivaran prastut karte hue lambii kavita yaa puri kavita likhakar use kavy-niabandh banane kii puraani style nai kavita ne tyaag di he
 Poets of new poetry have also written long poems
 kintu ve puraane prabandh kavy ke samaanaantar nahin he
 Each poet of a new poem has his own personal specialty
 nae kaviyon ke liye pradhan he sampreshan, na ki sampreshan kaa madhyam
 Thus we see that the new poem is a significant achievement both in terms of narrative and craft

 The ancestors of the Muslim people found in India were Hindus, information has been received from various sources about this

 Similarly, in the book "explaining communal violence" it is also believed that in the Indian books it is shown that Muslim religion has been in India for thousands of years, but even then 95% of the population of the current Indian Muslims is the original Hindu ancestor

 This class of Kura orders were severely persecuted against the Shudra people mentioned in Manu Smriti by a Brahmin named Sumati Bhargava in the name of sage Bhrigu

 In this book, Shudra also made provision of terrible physical punishment on minor crimes
 unhen saamaajik or dharmik jivan main nimnata kii or jane par vivash kiya gaya
 Thus they were forced into mental slavery

 This was a fierce attack on the caste system

 But gradually these people understood and after the arrival of Islam and Christianity in India, millions of Shudras became Muslims and Christians Page 329 | | bharat varsh kii kai hindu jaateey madhyakaalin bharat main hindu dharm chhod kar muslim dharm main chali gayi thi milte bharat main pai jane vaali vibhinn muslim jatiyon, jo apana mul hindu dharm ko maanati he, iskaa sankshipt vivaran nimnaankit he - *patel - gujarat main pai jane vaali pramukh muslim jati | 15 vi sadi main mukhyat: is jati ke logo ne muslim dharm ko sweekaar kar liya

 This caste would marry mainly in their society
 *pinjaraa yaa pinaaraa - rui kii dhunaai kaa kaary karne vaali muslim jati he | ye log 11 vi sadi main aurangzaib ke samay muslim dharm main parivartit hue the
 But some Hindu religious rituals and the practice of marrying in their own community indicate Hindu origin, these people do not eat cow meat and follow Hindu ritual, Khol Bharavo
 Some Gujarati Muslim ethnic like Lohana Memon etc
 Hinduism too Have changed since then

04 The capital of Kerala is Pampa at a distance of 175 km from Thiruvananthapuram and four to five km from there lies the Shabarimala temple at an altitude of about 1000 meters above sea level, amidst the dense forests of the Sahyaparvat ranges from the Western Ghats
 makka-madina ke baad yah duniya kaa doosraa sabase bada tirth mana jaataa he, jahaan har saal karodon kii sankhya main shraddhalu aate hai
 Shabarimala is a wonderful link between Shaiva and Vaishnavas
 malayalam main 'shabarimala' kaa arth hota he, parvat
 In fact, this place is located in the Pathnathita district, surrounded by the Sahyadri ranges
 panpa se sabarimala tak paidal yatra kerani padati he
 This route is five kilometers long
 kamb ramayana, mahabhagwat ke ashtum skandh or skandapurana ke asur cond main jis shishu shasta kaa zikr he, ayppan usee ke avatar maane jate hai
 It is said that Shasta was born to the consort of Mohini Veshadhari Vishnu and Shiva
 unheen ayppan kaa mashhoor mandir punakvan ke naam se vikhyath 18 pahadiyon ke bich sthit is dham main he, jise sabarimala shridharmashashtha mandir kaha jaataa he
 It is also believed that Parashurama installed the idol at Sabarimala for Ayyappan worship
 kuch log ise rambhakt shabari ke naam se jodakar bhi dekhte hai
 Some people say that about 700-800 years ago, there was a lot of disharmony between Shaivites and Vaishnavas in the south
 tab un matbhedon ko dur karne ke liye shri ayppan kii pariklpana kii gai
 This dharmatirtha was developed to coordinate both
 aaj bhi yah mandir samanvay or sadbhaav kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Here people from any caste-fraternity and any religion can come
 panpa pahunchakar hamane paidal hi sabarimala tak kii yatra karne kaa faisla kiya
 This path is inaccessible, but the feeling of being among nature makes the mind ready to take such a risk
 makar sankranti or uttara phalguni nakshatra ke sanyog ke din, panchami tithi or vrishchik lagn ke sanyog ke samay hi shri ayppan kaa janm mana jaataa he
 That is why the festival is celebrated in the Dharmashastha temple on the day of Makar Sankranti
 ham makar sankranti ke din hi vahaan pahunche
 This temple is not only beautiful in terms of architecture, it also has a strange feeling of peace
 jis tarah yah 18 pahadiyon ke bich sthit he, usee tarah mandir ke praangan main pahunchane ke liye bhi 18 sidhiyaan paar kerani padati hai
 Apart from Ayyappan in the temple, there are also idols of sub-deities like Malikapurut Amma, Ganesh and Nagaraja
 utsav ke dauraan ayppan kaa ghi se abhishek kiya jaataa he
 Mantras were being chanted loudly
 parisar ke ek kone main saje-dhaje hathi khadey the
 After the puja, prasad 'aravana' made of rice, jaggery and ghee was distributed to everyone
 makar sankranti ke alaava november kii 17 taarikh ko bhi yahaan bada utsav manaaya jaataa he
 The doors of the temple are also opened on the first five days of the Malayalam months
 inke alaava puure saal mandir ke daravaaje aam darshanathiyon ke liye band rahete hai
 Consider one more thing here
 yahaan zyaadaatar purush bhakt maujuud the
 Female devotees were few
 agar thim bhi, to budhi auraten
 When asked about this by a priest of the temple, it came to know that Sri Ayyappan was a Brahmachari
 isliye yahaan ve choti bacchiyaan aa sakati hai, jo rajaswala na hui hon yaa budhi auraten, jo isse mukt ho chuki hai
 Despite not accepting the bond of caste-religion, this bond is to be followed by the devotees
 baaki, dharm nirpekshata kii adbhut misaal yah dekhne ko milti he ki yahaan se kuch hi duuri par erumeli naamak jagah par shri ayppan ke sahyogi maane jane vaale muslim dharmanuai vaavar kaa makbara bhi he, jahaan mattha teke bina yahaan kii yatra puri nahin maani jaati
 Apart from the coordination of two votes, a unique form of religious tolerance was seen here
 dharm insaan ko vyapak najariya detaa he, isaki bhi pushti hui
 In the broad sense that if there is true faith in the mind, then the distinction between the devotee and God is erased
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki agar koi vyakti tulsi yaa rudraksh kii maala pahanakar, vrath rakhkar, sir par naivedhy se bhari potli lekar yahaan pahunche, to uski manokamana jarur puri hoti he
 On wearing the garland, the devotee starts being called Swami and then there is no distinction between God and the devotee
 vaise shri dharmashashtha mandir main log jatthon main aate hai
 The person who leads the batch, Iramudi is in his hands
 pehle paidal milon yatra karne vaale log apane saath khaane-pine kii vasteen bhi potliyon main lekar chalate the
 This was the custom of pilgrimage
 ab aisa nahin
 But devotion is the same
 usee bhakthi bhav ke saath yahaan karodon kii sankhya main log aate hai
 Between November and January last year, the number of people visiting here was estimated to be around five crore
 yahaan kii vyavastha dekhne vaale triancor devasvam board ke mutabik, is avadhi main tirthasthal ne kerala kii arthvyavastha ko 10 hajaar karod rupee pradaan kiye hai

 Under this scheme, up to one lakh rupees are given to the devotee or his family in case of injury or death
 iske alaava board ke yaa sarkari karmchaariyon ke saath agar koi haadasa hota he, to unhen board unhen dedh lakh rupee tak detaa he
 Travelers coming from north direction can descend to Pampa via Ernakulam by descending from Kottayam or Chengannur railway station, 116 km and 93 km respectively

 Definitive words are words, composite-words or multi-literal expressions that are used to have specific meaning in a specific context
 ye 'vishisht arth' un shabdon ke 'saamaanya upyog ke arth' se bahut alag ho sakate hai
 For example, 'work' in the ordinary sense means to do any work - such as eating, laughing, walking, reading, etc
, but in physics, the product of force and displacement due to that force in its direction is called work
 shabdaawalee vigyaan vah vidha he jo paribhaashik shabdon ke vikaas tathaa anya pahaluon kaa adhyayan karti he
 But it is worth noting that vocabulary science is different from lexicography because vocabulary science also involves the study of concepts and community of concepts

 The construction of the information center took about five years
 isko march 2003 main jigyaasuon ke liye kholaa gaya
 The Information Center houses the main auditorium, which can seat around 400 people simultaneously
 iske atirikt do chote sabhaagaar bhi hai, jisamen kareeb 70 siten he
 In the information center, people are also given information about the Bahá'í religion
 iske saath hi aagantukon ko lotus temple kii jaankaree di jaati he
 There are a total of seven Bahá'í temples worldwide with this temple

258600 pratioxikaarak yaa pratiupachaayak ve yogic hai jinako alp maatra main duusare padaartho main mila dene se vayumdal ke oxigen ke saath unki abhikriya kaa nirodh ho jaataa he
 These compounds are also known as anti-oxidation and stabilizing and are also called stabilizers
 arthath prati-oxykaarak ve anu hai, jo anya anuon ko oxikaran se bachaate hai yaa anya anuon kii oxikaran prakriya ko dhimaa kar dete hai
 Oxidation is a type of chemical action by which electrons or hydrogen from a substance are transferred to an oxidizing agent
 pratioxykarakon kaa upyog chikitsavigyaan tathaa udyogon main hota he
 petrol 
 ye pratioxikaarak chipchipahat paidaa karne vaale padaarth nahin banane dete jo anterdahan ingine ke liye hanikaarak hai
 Often derivatives of substituted phenols and phenylenediamine are used for this work
 anek yogic hawa main khule rakhe jane par hawa ke oxigen dwaara swat: oxikrut ho jate hai
 As a result of this chemical action, some undesirable properties come in those substances, which make them unsuitable for general use
 is prakaar ke anek parivartanon kaa bodh saadhaaran indriyon dwaara ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the knowledge of the deterioration of substances by automatic oxidation and keeping them safe for more days was known to humans for a long time, although full knowledge of the process of 'automatic oxidation' could be obtained much later
 swat: oxikaran kii kriya chaar padon main sampann hoti he : The initial term that occurs at a very slow pace, kramash: teevr honevaali gati, Almost constant speed and antim hrasonmukhi gati
 The period leading up to the first term and the slow pace of the second term is called the inspiration period and it shows this
 yah baat shrunkhlaa abhikriya ke aadhaar par oxikaran abhikriya prakram kii pushti karti he
 In the automatic oxidation process, the actuators of the chain are free radicals which are very active
 swat: oxikrut honevaale anu main jo sabase nirbal carbon-hydrogen bandha hota he usee ke tuutane se ye mulak banate hai
 Therefore, the presence of a hydrogen atom easily emitted in this type of material is necessary
 iske atirikt usamen ek dwibandh bhi hona chahie jiske saath muktamulak sanyukt ho sake
 Although oxidation reactions are very important for life, they can also be harmful
 oxikaran abhikriya se muktamulak utpann ho sakate hai, jinke dwaara koshikaon ko kshati pahunchane vaali shrunkhlaa abhikriya aarambh ho jaati he
 Antioxidants themselves are oxidized to these free radicals, which helps to break the chain reaction
 kar koshikaon par hone vaali in shrunkhlaa abhikriyaaon ko roak dete hai
 Therefore, there are often antioxidant reducing agents, such as thiol, ascorbic acid or polyphenols, etc
 padpon evam jantuon main vividh prakaar ke pratioxykarakon ke nirmaan evam sangrah kii jatil vyavastha paayi jaati he
 These include glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin E, enzymes etc
 pratioxykarakon kii aparyaapt maatra hone par yaa pratioxikaarak anzimon ke nasht hone se oxikar tanaav paidaa hota he jisase koshikaon ko kshati ho sakati he yaa unki mrityu ho sakati he
 It is believed that oxidative stress is the cause of many diseases
 isliye bheshajagunavigyaan main pratioxykarakon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya jaataa he visheshtah aghat tathaa tantrika-apbhrashti rogon ke liye yah bahut mahatvapurn hai
 Oxygen stress is the cause and result of diseases
 pratioxykarakon kaa poorak bhojan ke rup main khub prayog kiya jaataa he
 Antioxidants are most organic compounds, such as aromatic amine, phenol, amino phenol, etc
, which can be easily extracted from hydrogen atoms to transform into free radicals and propagate chain reactions
 pratioxikaarak apana kaary karte samay swat: nasht ho jate hai yaa swat: oxikrut honevaale padaarth inako kramash: nasht kar dete hai
 Some substances like rubber, gasoline and lubricating oils are automatically present in them but they get destroyed during their treatment
 at: is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana padataa he ki ve nasht na hon yaa shodhan ke baad phir unamem or pratioxikaarak milanaa padataa he
 Many aldehydes, such as benzaldehyde, are auto-oxidized at a very rapid rate, so antioxidants such as hydroquinone, alphanaphthal, catechol, etc
 have to be used to prevent this
 vidin temptesan ek dach simphonic metal band he jisaki sthapana 1996 main gayika sheron den edal or guitar vadak robert westerolt ne kii thi

 gurutvkarshan ek padaarth dwaara ek duusare kii ore aakrisht hone kii pravriti he
 The first attempt to give a mathematical formula about gravity was made by Isaac Newton, which was surprisingly correct
 unhone gurutvkarshan siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Newton's theory was later replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
 isse purv varah mihir ne kaha tha ki kisi prakaar kii shakti hi vastuon ko pruthivi par chipkaae rakhti he
 Modern work on the theory of gravity began in the late 16th and early 17th century with the work of Galileo Galilei
 apane mashhoor prayogon main pisa ke tower se gendon ko chhodane kaa prayog kiya gaya, or baad main gendon ke saavdhaneepurvak maap ke saath incleain ko ghumaya gaya, galileo ne dikhaaya ki gurutvkarshan twaran sabhi vastuon ke liye samaan he
 This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have higher gravitational acceleration
 galileo ne hawa ke pratirodh ko is kaaran ke rup main bataaya ki kam dravyaman vaali vasteen vaataavaran main dhimi gati se gir sakati hai
 Galileo's work set the stage for the creation of Newton's theory of gravity iske baad ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa sambandh hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutv niyatank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration
 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 german khagolvid kepler ne grahon kii gati kaa adhyayan karke teen niyam diye
 Kepler's first law: - All planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits and the Sun is at the focus of those orbits
 dwitiya niyam - kisi bhi grah ko surya se milaane vaali rekha samaan samay me samaan kshetrafal paar karti he
 That is, the regional speed of each planet remains fixed
 arthath jab grah surya se dur hota he to uski chaal kam ho jaati he
 Third law: - The square of the Sun's rotation period of each planet is proportional to the third power of the semi-long axis of its long circular orbit
 gurutvkarshan: "pitaaji, yah prithvi, jis par ham nivas karte hai, kis par tiki hui he?" leelavati ne shatabdiyon purv yah prashn apane pita bhaskaracharya se poocha tha
 In response, Bhaskaracharya said, "bale Leelavati !, some people who say that this earth is based on Sheshnag, Tortoise or Elephant or any other thing, then they are wrong
 yadi yah maan bhi liya jaae ki yah kisi vastu par tiki hui he to bhi prashn bana rahata he ki vah vastu kis par tiki hui he or is prakaar kaaran kaa kaaran or phir uskaa kaaran


 yah kram chalata rahaa, to nyaay shaastra main ise anavastha dosha kehete hai
 Lilavati said, yet the question remains, what is the earth resting on? tab bhaskaracharya ne kaha, kyon ham yah nahin maan sakate ki prithvi kisi bhi vastu par aadhaarit nahin he
 xxrep 5 
 If we say that the earth rests on its own force and call it gravitational force, then what is the fault? is par leelavati ne poocha yah kaise sambhav he
 Then Bhaskaracharya says about the theory that the power of things is very strange
 aage kehete hai- That is, there is attraction power in the earth
 prithvi apni aakarshan shakti se baari padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he or aakarshan ke kaaran vah jameen par girte hai
 But when the same strength came from all around in the sky, how did anyone fall? That is, the planets in the sky remain motionless because the gravitational powers of various planets keep balance
