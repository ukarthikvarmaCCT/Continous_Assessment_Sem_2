 Shivilaranava is an epic poem by Neelkanth Dixit, grandson of Achcha Dixit and son of Narayan Dixit
 is mahakavy main 22 sarg hai
 More than 20 kings who originated in Pandyavansh worshiping Sundareswarar along with Meenakshi Devi, who are engaged in Shiv Bhakti, are described here
 isamen shant ras pradhan rup main varnit he, anya sabhi rason kaa varnan angabhoot uplabdh hota he
 The story is taken from the Agastya Samhita of Skandpurana, hence it is the result of this epic
 prarambh main vastunirdeshaatmak mangalacharan kiya gaya he- In the context of Khal blasphemy, the poet says that Brahma had filled the mouth of evil-witted skulls with garlic and neem at the time of creation
 isi se unke mukh main durgandh or tiktata paayi jaati he- There are 22 verses in the form of verses such as the Nati Swalp and the Nadi long 22 canto 20waan or 21waan sarg nanaavrittamay he
 28 verses have been used in this poem
 drutvilambit kii chata avlokaneey he- Mahakavi has used verses like coupler, Kalapaka, Kulak and Chakkalak
 sandhyaa, suryoday, chandroday, raatri, pradosh andhkaar, din, praatah, madhyahn, mrugaya, parvat, ritu, upavan, nadi, sagar aadi kaa varnan yatra-tatra kavy main samuplabdh hota he
 Describing the Tamraparni river, the Mahakavi has said that Lord Shankar's love for Ganga is the same except for Tamraparni, as the love of Madar even when Ketki flower is present- basant ritu kaa varnan karte hue kavi kahata he- In the fourth canto in the order of city description, the poet has described the city of Madhura
 vahaan naam kii sarthakata bataate hue kavi ne kaha he-jeemuthavahan ne divya sudhamay gandhon se is naveen nagar ko teen dinon tak sechan karaayaa
 'this metropolis will be called Madhura due to its honeybee coherence' - this is the way AIR naye-naye shabdon kaa prayog karne main mahakavi nilkantha magh ko bhi peeche chhod dete hai
 In these the word repetition is negligible
 isliye dow0 dadan upaadhyaay ne thik hi kaha he- The collected usage of a word in many ways can be seen in this epic
 ek hi pushkar shabd kaa chaar arthon main prayog sahruday hridayahladak he- In the use of ornaments, the poet is everywhere careful
 is kavy main upama, roopak, utpreksha, virodhabhas, vyatirek, arthantar nyaas aadi alankaaron kii romaniyata darshneey he
 An example of upma is visual utpreksha kii chata bhi prekshniya he- bhagwaan shankar ne vivaah ke samay jab kaa×chan ambar dhaaran kiya, uskaa varnan kavi ne is prakaar kiya he- The poet's inspiration for the devotees who offer kasturi and camphor to Lord Shankar is observable- yah mahakavi kisi bhi vastu kaa alankarik chi tran karne main siddhhast prathit hota he
 Her imagination is about the creation of woman - raja ke pratap or kirti kaa manohar varnan kavi ne kiya he- Kantasamith is poetic for preaching
 parantu raja kulsekhar ne apane putr malayadhvaj ko shikshit karne ke bahaane lokon ko upadesh diya he yah upadesh banbhatta ke shukanasopadesh kaa samaran karaata he
 At one place, the mother has preached to her daughter
 jo shakuntala ke prati kanv ke upadesh kaa samaran karaata he- The great Shaiv philosophy has been established in poetry by his great talent
 shivbhaktipravan hone ke kaa ran yadhyapi yah kavy shant ras pradhan he phir bhi anya rason kaa varnan ang rup main hua he
 There is a feeling of heroic juice in the context of war
 bich-bich main shringaar ras kii mriduta avismaraneey he
 In the context of the description of Kuchdvay the poet says- nayika ke soundaryavarnan ke prasang main kavi kii kavyapatutaa avlokaneey he- Despite being a Vaidarbhi custom, this poem is enchanted with Prasadam
 kavy main shastraantar kaa putapaak bhi sahrudayon ko shaastra vichaarna ke liye unmukh karata he
 The great poet Shri Dixit embodies the doctrine of monotheism of Vedanta with full skill
 kashipathi vishweshwar ke tarakmantra daan se kaivalya pradaan kii mahima kaa varnan kavi ne is prakaar kiya he- It is clear from the above discussion that Shrikantha Dixit's well-known this Shivilaranava poetry meets the test of the characteristics of a successful epic

 Katyayan's annual total is about 1500, which is not found elsewhere, but is available only as a reference by Patanjali in grammar language
 sanskrit ke teen mahaan vaiyakarnon main patanjali bhi hai
 The other two are Panini and Katyayan

 Its composition is believed to be of the second century BCE

 Subject rendering is another feature

 But in its order of commentary, the planning of interpretation is divided, which also means that a "great language" was written

 This theory has been elaborated by Bhartrihari in syntax
 mahabhashya kii mahatta kaa yah kaaran he
 From the literary point of view, the prose of the Mahabhashya is highly inarticulate, idiomatic, fluent and candid

 In Sanskrit grammar, "munitriya" is given a very high and authentic position
 ashtaadhi-car panini, vaarttikkaar katyayan or mahabhashyakaar patanjali - inhen teenon ko "munitray" kaha gaya he
 In addition to the branch of Paninian grammar in the history of grammatology, there have been many grammar branches, pre and post
 parantu "munitray" se poshit or samarthit vyakaran kii panineey shakha ko jo prasiddhi, manyata or lokapriyata praapt hui vah anya shakhaon ko nahin mil saki - jiskaa kaaran mahabhashya hi mana gaya he
 The "katyayana" on Ashtadhyayi made grammatical principles more complete and clear by the creation of the Vāratyas
 "patanjali" ne mukhyat: vaarttikon kii vyakhya ko mahabhashya dwaara aage badhaayaa
 He has also proved the repudiation of Katyayanatam and the recognition of Panamnimat at many places
 kabhi-kabhi un sutron kii bhi vivechna kii he jo katyayan ne chhod die the
 Directing the composition book of this Mahabhashya, the lexicographer "bhartrihari" has reported that when the readers of grammar became short-sighted and short-sighted, the "collection" text was destroyed, then the pilgrim Guru Patanjali composed the Mahabhashya, which also contains the essays of all the judges
 
 isse pataa chalata he ki "patanjali" ke purv "sangrah" naamak granth main vyakaran sambhddha vivechan atyant vistrut tha
 Nagesh Bhatt has mentioned in the book "collection" that there are one lakh verses in the epic and Pradeep's commentary 'udyot'

 In 1987, Konkani was given the official language status of Marathi in Goa, but could not be implemented till date due to disagreement on the script
 konkani anek lipiyon main likhi jaati rahi he; jaise - devanagari, kannada, malayalam or roman
 After the state status of Goa, Konkani has been declared the official language of the Dawanagari script

 This Kanari word is not even related to Kannada

 The traveler named Tom Pirish, in his book 'sum Oriental', which was written in 1515 AD, has given the name of the dialect of Goa as Konkoni
 1658 main jesuit padri migled almaid ne bhi gomantaki ke liye 'konkani' shabd kaa prayog kiya he

 He said that this fundamental religious sentiment was a hindrance in the development of bird studies in India
 it is true that i despise purposeless killing, and regard it as an act of vandalism, deserving the severest condemnation
 But my love for birds is not of the sentimental variety
 It is essentially aesthetic and scientific, and in some cases may even be pragmatic
 For a scientific approach to bird study, it is often necessary to sacrifice a few, 


 i have no doubt that but for the methodical collecting of specimens in my earlier years - several thousands, alas - it would have been impossible to advance our taxonomical knowledge of Indian birds 


 nor indeed of their geographic distribution, ecology, and bionomics

 Plants live in society
 ye vaataavaran ko badalte hai or vaataavaran inke samaaj kii ruparekha ko badalata he
 This sequence continues again and again
 ise anukraman kehete hai
 a situation comes when the environment and plant societies come into dynamic equilibrium in a way
 badalte hue anukraman ke padap samaaj ko kramak kehete hai or gatik samya ko charam avasthaa kehete hai
 There is a certain type of dynamic equilibrium in any climate
 agar iske atirikt koi or prakaar kaa sthir samaaj banataa ho, to use charam avasthaa na kah usase ek str kam hi maanate hai
 Scientists consider such a situation as the monoclimax idea and consider climate to be the best cause
 iske vipareet he policlimex vichaardhaara, jisamen jalwaayu hi nahin varan koi bhi kaarak pradhan ho saktaa he
 In view of the environment of plants, the three main things are climate, fauna and soil
 aajkal echosystem vichaardhaara or nae nae mat adhik maanya ho rahe hai
 Grasslands, river, pond or sea, forest etc
 are some examples of ecosystem
 jal ke vichaar se paristhitiki main paudhon ko Jalodbhid, which grows in water, samodbhid, jo prithvi par hon evam jahaan sam maatra main jal mili, tathaa Xerophytes, which grow in dry desert, say
 in paudhon kii aakaariki kaa anukulan vishesh vaataavaran main rahane ke liye hota he, jaise jalodbhid paudhon main hawa rahane ke utak hote hai, jisase shwasan bhi ho sake or ye jal main tairte rahen
 Studies about forest, or silviculture, can also be considered a part of ecology
 paristhitiki ke us bhaag ko jo manushya ke laabh ke liye ho, anuprayukt paristhitiki kehete hai
 The plants which grow in sand are called Samyabhid

 Plants that grow in salt marshes are called salivary, such as the Garaan of the Sundarbans, those that grow in intense sunlight, those called the atrophy and those that grow in the shade are called Samophyta
 iske antargat paudhon ke sharir main har ek kaary kis prakaar hota he iskaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 The organism is colloidal in nature and is scattered in water
 bhautik niyamon ke anusaar jal yaa lavan mitti se jad ke rome ke kala kii koshikaon kii deevaaron dwaara pravesh karata he or sandran ke bahaav kii ore se badhata hua sanvahani nalika main pravesh karata he
 Scientists did not agree on how this water etc
 would climb upwards from here, but now it is believed that they reach the part of the stem from the root through capillary tube capillarily
 paudhon ke sharir kaa jal vayumandal ke sampark main pattee ke chhidr dwaara aata he
 Here also water particles are released into the air, if the concentration of water in air is less
 jaise bhiige kapade kaa jal vashpibhoot ho vaayu main nikalataa he, thik usee prakaar yah bhi ek bhautik kaary he
 Now the question arises that from where plants get energy for every task and how the energy is changed from one type to another
 sankshep main kaha ja saktaa he ki parnaharith par prakaash padane se prakaash kii urja ko parnaharith pakad kar carbondiaksaide or jal dwaara glucose or oxygen banaata he
 These are the sources of energy
 prakruti main paudhon dwaara nitrogen kaa chakra bhi chalata he
 The sum of light is of great importance in plant growth
 prakaash se hi paudhon kaa aakaar or bhaar badhate hai tathaa nae utakon or aakaar yaa daaliyon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Plants that do not get light, turn yellow
 aise padpon ko pandurit kehete hai
 At the time of light, depending on the time of day, the leaf formation of the plant, fall, and flower formation depends
 ise deeptikalitha kehete hai
 How much light is necessary in a 24-hour cycle so that the plants can flower, it is called a revolutionary lamp
 kuch paudhe deergh deeptikali hote hai or kuch alp deeptikali or kuch udasin hote hai
