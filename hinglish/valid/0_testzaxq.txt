 Vivekachudamani is a famous book written in the Sanskrit language by Adi Shankaracharya in which Advaita Vedanta is interpreted
 isamen brahmanishtha kaa mahatva, gyanoplabdhi kaa upaay, prashn-nirupan, atmagyaan kaa mahatva, panchpraan, aatm-nirupan, mukti kaise hogi, atmagyaan kaa fal aadi tatvagyan ke vibhinn vishyon kaa atyant sundar nirupan kiya gaya he
 It is believed that this book contains the essence of all the Vedas
 shankaracharya ne apane balykaal main hi is granth kii rachana kii thi
 It is believed that in pre-788 AD, the ethos of Sanatana Dharma began to decline in the Aryavarta and spread with hypocrisy with Vedic knowledge
 veda ke viruddh prachaar hone se bahut se sanathan dharmi log pujan aadi karmo se tathaa pitrukarmo se virakt hokar dusro ko bhi dharm se vimukt kar rahe the
 In the immediate period of time, the mood of Sanatan Dharma increased, then Adi Shankaracharya appeared in the present day famous state of India in that period
 ye balak janm se hi vilakshan tha or apni 32 varsh kii alpaaayu main hi sanskrit bhashaa main bahut se granthon kii rachana kii, bharat bhraman karke alag-alag chaar jagahon par shankaracharya matho kii sthapana kii
 Through Vivekachudamani and other texts, the Vedo rituals were reestablished
 shankaracharya ne is granth ke dwaara advait mat kaa sthaapan kiya
 The knowledge of Sanatana Dharma is in the four Vedas which are considered to be the basic basis, but Shankaracharya felt that the role of all people is not such that one can understand it and recognize the distinction of self-deprecating substances
 koi esa granth hona chahie jisamen chaaron vedo kaa saar ho, thode aksharomen sampoorn aadhyatm vidya kaa siddhant likhaa jaay jisko padhane se jansadharan ko bhi aatm-anatm kaa vivek sugam saadhy ho
 Shankaracharya composed this book with this purpose
 jin logon ko vaidic sanskrit samaj nahin aata tha unke liye bhi ye granth upyogi bana
 According to Shankaracharya's biography, whatever books he finds were written in Kashi and Badrikashram
 aadi shankaracharya ne apane 11-12 varsh kii aayu main hi sanskrit bhashaa main 250 se zyada granthon kii rachana kii thi

 As of 2014, flash memory was the technology to compete as a solid state operator in the field of additional or auxiliary storage
 In the coming times, it is believed that the hard disk will continue its dominance, but where speed and low power consumption are more important, solid state equipment is being used in place of hard disk
 hard discs arthath sakht chakrika sanchaalak ko pehali baar 1956 main ai bi em ke vaastavik samay transction processing computer ke liye data bhandaaran yukti ke rup main pesh kiya gaya tha
 It was also developed for general use, mainframes and use on small computers
 yah pehla ai bi ium drive 350 aar mike do refrigerator ke samaan bada tha or yah 5 million 6 bit aksharon ko rakhane kii kshamta rakhata tha
 It saved the data on a stack of 50 disks
 1962 main ibidam model 1311 ne discs drive laayaa jo washing mashin ke aakaar kaa tha or yah ek hataa sakane vaale discs pack par 20 lakh aksharon ko surakshit rakh saktaa tha
 Users could buy additional packs and interchange them as needed, exactly like magnetic tape reels
 iske baad ke discs pack drivs jo ibidam or duusari companiyon ne banaaye the, computers main istemaal hone lage or 1980 ke dashak tak yah 300 megabite kii kshamta tak pahunch gaye
 hdds that cannot be removed from computers are called "fixed disk" drives
 kuch ucch nishpaadan kshamta vaale achdidi banaaye gaye the jisame prati patari ek nok thi jaise ibidam 2305 taaki nok ko ek patari se duusari patari tak le jane main jo samay vyateet hota he, use bachaaya ja sake
 These were called "fixed heads" or "track on heads" disk drives
 yah bahut manhage the or inhe ab banaaya nahin jaataa
 In 1973, IBM launched a new type of HDD called the "winchester" code
 isamen praathmik taur se khaas baat yah thi kii bijli chale jane par discs head puri tarah se plater se alag nahin hota tha
 Rather it stayed in a particular place of the head disc when the disc stopped moving
 phir se shuru hone par discs head vahi se shuruyaat karata tha
 This proved effective in reducing the expenses of the head promoter system
 vincester praudyogiki ke pehle drivs main hathaaye ja sakane vaale golakaar hisse hote the
 It had a disk pack and a write and read nozzle system
 pravartak motor se jude hue chakke main hi rahata tha
 Subsequent "winchester" drives replaced removable disk packs and used non-removable disk planters
 pehle vincester drivs ke plantres 14 inch ke vyas vaale hua karte the
 After a few years, there was a possibility that if the planters are small then perhaps there may be some more benefits
 8 inch vyas ke plantres vaale drivs aaye or inke baad 5 1 / 4 inch vyas ke plantres vaale drivs bhi aaye
 The 5 1 / 4 inch drives were designed to market the personal computers growing rapidly at the time
 1980 ke dashak ke shuruyaat main HDD bahut manhage the, lekin 1980 ke dashak ke ant tak inke bhav itane kam ho gaye ki sabase saste computaron main bhi inako istemaal kiya jane laga
 In the early 1980s, most hdds were sold as a separate subsystem to the personal computer user
 is up pranali ko drive nirmaataa ke naam se nahin balki up pranali nirmaataa ke naam se bechaa jaataa tha jaise corvas systams, tolgrass technologys yaa to phir nirmaataa ke naam se jaise appal profile
 The IBM PC / XT, launched by IBM in 1983, had a 10-megabyte internal HDD, and since then internal hdds have been used regularly in personal computers
 appal macintosh par bahari achdidi lambe samay tak istemaal kiye jate rahe
 Between 1986 and 1998, every Macintosh computer had a SCSI port on the back to connect external hdds
 2011 ke thailand main aaye baadh ne kai data bhandaaran yantra utpaadak sayantron ko nuksaan pahuchaya tha jisase 2012-2013 ke bich data bhandaaran yantra ke keemton main izaafaa hua tha
 Since the invention of hdds, their air density has steadily increased
 data bhandaaran yantra par ferromegnetic padaarth kii ek patali film hoti he jise aakrisht karke data bhandaaran yantra aankanon ko sahejataa he
 The change of direction of the magnetic field in a sequential manner represents the binary data bits
 chumbakeekaran ke badlaav ko jaanch karke data discs / yantra se padhaa jaataa he
 The data is encoded using a code-writing method
 jaise ran length limited kuta lekhan vidhi
 Which present the data according to the change of magnetic direction
 ek achdidi main takala hota hai jo sapaat gol discs ko pakade rahati hai
 Planters are generally made of non-magnetized materials such as aluminum alloy, glass or ceramic
 in plantres ke upar chumbakeey padaarth kii lep kii jaati hai jo data pakade rahati hai
 The layer of this magnetic material has a thickness of 10 to 20 nanometers and a layer of carbon over it for its protection
 yah chumbakeey padaarth kii parat paper ke motaai se bhi kam hoti hai jo kii 7 xxrep 4 0 se 18 xxrep 4 0 nanometer hoti hai
 Today's hard disk planters are rotated at different speeds, ranging from 4200 rotations per minute in portable devices to 15,000 rpm in high performance capacity servers
 pehla achdidi 1200 arpm kii gati se ghuma tha or kai varsh tak saare achdidi 3600 arpm main ghoomte the
 As of December 2013, most consumer-class hdds run at 5400 rpm or 7200 revolutions per minute
 plater jaise hi read - rhite head ke neeche ghumta hai us samay soochna plater par se padhi jaati hai yaa likhi jaati hai
 Reed - Right head and plotter have very short distances of just a few nanometers
 read - rhite head uske neeche ke chumbakeey padaarth ko padhane or badalane kaa kaam karata hai
 Modern hdds have a reed-right head above each magnetized plotter that is attached to a common arm
 ek gati denevaali bhujaa head ko discs ke ghoomte samay ek vrutt-chaap kii disha main hilaati hai taaki harek head plater ke pure sataha tak pahunch sake
 Voice coil actuators or some earlier designs use stepper motors to move this arm
 drive main jo chumbakeey plate lagi hoti he uske upar prakaashiya tapavarodhan kiya jaataa he
 In earlier hard disk drives, static / same bits were written in seconds, so data was on every track
 lekin aadhunik discs drivs main jone bit recording istemaal karte hai isamen likhane kii raftaar andar se baahar ke trek / patari main jate hue badhati rahati hai isse baahar ke patariyon main zyaada data surakshit rakh sakate hai
 Due to the small size of the magnetic field in modern instruments, it is likely that it can lose its magnetic state due to heat
 garmi ke vajah se hui is chumbakeey asthirataa ko "superperamagnetic limit" bhi kaha jaataa hai
 To avoid this situation, planters are coated with two parallel magnetic layers, between them there is a non-magnetized layer of 3 molecules thickness
 donon parato main vipareet disha main chumbakeey prabhaav hota hai, is prakaar donon parat ek duusare ko sudrudh karte hai
 Another technique used to deal with the effect of heat is called perpendicular recording
 isse recording dencity bhi zyaada milti hai 2005 main ise pehali baar ship kiya gaya tha aaj kai HDD yah takanic istemaal kar rahi hai
 a simple HDD consists of two electric motors
 ek takali se lagi hui motor jo chakrika ko ghumaati hai or ek pravartak motor jo read / rhite head pranali ko ghoomte hue chakrika ke upar le jaataa hai
 The motor connected to the disc has an external rotor that is connected with the disc, the electrical conductor permanent winding wire] installed in one place
 pravartak ke thik vipareet takale se judy chadi ke ant par ek read -rhite head hoti hai
 This write / read nozzle is connected to a very thin electrical circuit with the amplifier electronics located at the focal point of the actuator
 nok kii sahaayak bhujaa vajan main bahut halaki or thos hoti he
 Its speed can be up to 550 g in modern devices
 pravartak ek sthaayee chumbak hota hai
 It has a rotating coil which drives the write / read tip at the right place
 dhaatu kii ek thali ek squat neodiminum -aayran -boron teevr pravaah vaale chumbak ko thame rakhti he
 Beneath this plate is a rotating metal latch, also called a voiced coil
 yah qoil pravartak ke centre se judaa rahata hai or is qoil ke neeche ek neodiminum -aayran -boron chumbak hota he
 It is mounted on a plate at the very bottom of the motor
 awaz vaali qoil kaa aakaar ek tir ke nok ke jaisaa hota hai or ise 2 baar lep kiye hue tambe ke chumbakeey taar se banaaya jaataa hai
 The inside surface is for heat insulation and the outside surface is hot plastic
 nok ke donon taraf ke qoil chumbakeey kshetra ke saath lagate rahete hai
 When the electric current travels in the direction of one metal flanks and in the outer direction of the other flakes, a tangent pressure is produced which rotates the actuator
 HDD ke electronics pravartak ke harakat ko niyantrit karti hai or discs ke parikraman yaa golakaar chalane ko bhi niyantrit karti hai
 She also works for reading or writing information from the disc according to the instructions of the disk controller
 drive electronics kii pratipushti chakrika ke khaas hisson se hoti hai jo sarvo pratipushti ke liye samarpit hota hai
 These are either fully concentric circles or the parts in which the real data are scattered
 ek data bhandaran yantra yaa sakht chakrika sanchaalak main ek yaa ek se zyaada tej ghoomane vaali chakrikaay or chumbakeey nok hote hai
 They are placed on top of a moving actuator arm so that the data can be written or read on the surface of the disc with the help of this tip
 jitna samay chumbakeey nok ko silinder yaa patari main le jane main lage or uske saath hi jo samay chakrika ke hisse ko nok ke neeche ghoomane main lage or kitna data har kshan main preshit ho rahaa hai in maapdando par hi data bhandaran yantra kaa pradarshan nishchit kiya jaataa hai
 Modern data storage devices use error correction codes a lot, especially the read-solomon error prevention code
 yah takanic atirikt bit sahej kar rakhti hai
 Each data block contains a few extra bits that use some math formulas to correct mistakes invisibly
 yah atirikt bits data bhandaran yantra main kuch jagah zarur le lete hai lekin yah data bhandaran yantra par zyaada lekhan ghanatv hona sambhav banaati hai or jo is prakriya main jo galtiyaan aa jaati hai unhen thik karnaa bhi sambhav banaati hai
 The result is that the storage capacity of the data storage device is high
 udhaaharan swaroop ek 1 tibi kshamta vaala data bhandaran yantra jisame 512 bite khand hai vah 93 jibi atirikt data bhandaaran kshamta paata hai
 Small density parity test codes have been replaced by reed-solomon in brand new data storage systems

85 inch form factor vaale HDD kaa nirmaan bandha kar diya hai kyunki yuasabi_flash_drive kii keemte ghat rahi hai or iname ko ghoomane vaala poorja bhi nahin hota
 The time it takes to access data depends on two reasons
 ghoomane vaale chakra kaa yantrik swabhaav
 Rotation speed of tip
 ek HDD kaa ausat abhigam kaal saare sambhav sik time kaa ausat hota hai matlab saare sambhavit sik time ko jitne baar aankanon ko padhne kii koshish hui hai unase bhaag karne par yah sankhya hamen milti hai
 But in practice we get this number from statisticians
 difregmentation ek paddati hai jise istemaal karke aankanon ko padhne main jo vilamb hota hai use kam se kam kiya ja saktaa hai
 In this, the related data are kept in areas close to each other
 kuch computer prachaalan tantra swachaalit tareeke se hi difregmentation karte hai
 The goal of automatic defragmentation is to reduce delays but the performance of hdds slows down for a while while this method is running
 ghoomane kii gati badhaakar yaa sik time kam karke data acces karne kaa samay sudhara ja saktaa hai
 Throughput can be increased by increasing air density, thereby increasing the data rate and the amount of data below the head, which also reduces the seek time
 ausatan sik time hai and sarwar ke hard drivs ke liye 4 ms kaa hota hai, mobile drivs ke liye 15 ms aam mobile drivs ke liye 12 ms or desktop hard drivs ke liye 9 ms kaa hota hai
 First, the hard disk drive had a peak time of 600 ms, by the mid-1970s, hard drives became available with a peak time of 25 ms
 shruwaat ke kuch desktop drivs main heads ko hilaane ke liye stepper motors kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha or iske vajah se sik time 80-120 ms jitna hua karata tha
 But by the 1980s, it started using voice coil type octation, making it faster, reducing the time to 20 ms
 iske baad sik time dhire dhire kam hota rahaa
 They typically store data from 60 GB to 4 TB and rotate at 5400 to 10,000 rotations per minute
 inamen onkanon ki sthanantaran gati 1jibi / second hoti hai
 By August 2014, the highest-capacity desktop HDD could store data up to 8 TB

 Typically, computers used by many consumers on which enterprise software runs are used
 jaise kii: len-dein prasanskaran database, internet kaa aadharbhoot dhaancha, niyar line bhandaaran
 Enterprise hdds generally run 24 hours a day, seven times a day, without any hassle

 Leninism is the Marxism of the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution
 vichaardhaara ke str par yah sarvhaara kranti kii or visheshkar sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee kaa siddhant or kaaryniti he
 Lenin continued that analysis of the capitalist method of production which Marx had done in capital and exposed the rules of economic and political development under the circumstances of imperialism
 leninavaad kii srujansheel aatma samaajawaadee kranti ke unke siddhant main vyakt hui he
 Lenin propounded that in new stages socialism may have emerged victorious in one or a few countries before
 unhone netritvkaari tathaa sanghathankaree shakti ke rup main sarvhaara varg kii dal vishyak mat ko pratipaadan kiya jiske bina sarvhaara adhinaayakatv kii uplabdhi tathaa samyavaadee samaaj kaa nirmaan asambhav he
 In fact, Leninism is a post-lenin ideological phenomenon
 lenin kaa dehanth 1924 main hua
 In his life he neither used the word 'leninism' nor encouraged his use
 ve apane vichaaron ko marxvaadi, samaajawaadee or communist shreniyon main rakh kar vyakt karte the
 Contrary to Lenin's attitude, in the last phase of his life, the top Communist leaders and theorists of the Soviet Communist Party developed various political and strategic perspectives around Lenin's key principles, strategies and strategies, based on which the configuration of Leninism would go further
 Got ready in netaaon main nikolai bukharin, leone trotski, joseph stallin, gregory zinoviv or lev kamenev pramukh the
 Stalin won the power struggle in the post-lenin period, which resulted in the loss of the remaining leaders
 atah aaj leninavaad kaa jo rup hamaare saamne he, us par pramukh taur par stallin kii vyakhyaaon kii chhap he
 Stalin wrote two books in 1934: "foundations of Leninism" and "problems of Leninism" which represent the official understanding of Leninism
 agar stallin dwaara di gayi paribhaasha maane to leninavaad samrajyavad or sarvhaara kranti ke yug kaa marxvad hone ke saath-saath sarvhaara kii taanaashaahee kii saidhaantiki or kaaryniti he
 It is clear that Stalin wanted to present Leninism as a universal principle by this definition
 unhen apane is lakshya main jo safalataa mili, uske peeche lenin dwaara soviet kranti ke baad 1919 main sthapit komintern kii bhoomika ko andekha nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Stalin's success can be gauged from the fact that most Marxist activists and leaders of the world consider Marxism incomplete without Leninism
 darasal, leninavaad clasical marxvad main kuch nayi baaten jodta he
 Firstly, instead of relying only on the revolutionary proletariat, it identifies itself as the main revolutionary force of the alliance of the revolutionary toiling masses, workers and peasants
 apane is yogadan ke kaaran leninavaad, marxvad ko viksit audyogic poonjeewaad kii simaaon se nikaal kar alpaviksit or ardh-aupniveshik deshon ke rashtriya mukti sangraamon ke liye upyogi vichaardhaara bana detaa he
 Leninism has emerged as a provision of practical method of revolution for communists and other radical elements of all such countries
 leninavaad ke is aayam ke mahatva kaa anumaan is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki mazdooron or kisaanon ke krantikari morche kii avadharana china, vietnam, korea or laathini america main communist kranti ko agrgati dene main safal rahi he
 Communists in countries where communist revolutions could not take place also follow this central thesis of Leninism
 leninavaad krantikari raajnneetik karrwai ko sarvocch praathamikta detaa he, or is karrwai kii bagdor usne peshewar krantikariyon dwaara sanchalit or loktantric cendravaad par aadhaarit anushaasit communist party ko thamayi he
 Leninism holds that the working class cannot become spontaneously revolutionary only because of its economic struggles and other political activities
 uske liye krantikari chetana kii vaahak yah party hi banegi
 This second aspect of Leninism is equally important
 kuch vidwaan to yah bhi maanate hai ki party-sanghathan kaa usul hi leninavaad kaa marm he or isi main ek party kii hukumat vaale rajya kii sankalpana nihit he
 Struggling within the Russian Social People's Party in the early twentieth century, Lenin preferred to form a small and disciplined worker-based party that specializes in secretive politics rather than a mass-based party, showing the Russian situation as separate from the German situation
 peshewar sarvhaara krantikariyon kii yah party us krantikari-loktantric rujhaan kii vaahak honi thi jise lenin kii kranti-purv rachanaaon, visheshkar 'state and revolution' main spasht rup se dekha ja saktaa he, haalaanki is rachana main party ke sawaal par koi charchaa nahin he
 Lenin's party thinking reappeared between 1918 and 1922 when the nascent Soviet state was reeling under economic siege, foreign invasion, and civil war
 is dauraan lenin kii party kaa jo swaroop ubhara, uske kai pahalu pehle vaale krantikari- loktantric rujhaan ke anukool nahin the
 Leninism's instructions on party-organization can be summarized as follows: leninavaad party ke is dhaanche ko loktantric cendravaad kii sangya detaa he or duniya kii adhiktar communist partiyaan isi kaa paalan karti hai
 But at first sight, this structure, which seems clean and reasonable, has been much disputed within and outside the Communist movement
 lenin kii samakaleen siddhantkaar roza luckjamburg ne bhi isaki aalochana kii thi, haalaanki ve bolshevikon kii aam kaaryadisha se sahamat thim
 Rosa did not agree with Lenin's formulation that the working class does not have the ability to develop spontaneous revolutionary consciousness
 is party-dhaanche ke aalochakon kaa aarope he ki iske bheetar loktantr par hameshaa cendravaad haaavee rahata he isliye yah buniyadi taur par aloktantric hota he
 In such an organization, there is a tremendous tendency to establish a party dictatorship in the name of dictatorship of the proletariat
 antim vishleshan main aisi party majdoor varg ke hawaale se jo hukumat karti he usamen vah loktantric cendravaad ko party-sanghathan kii simaaon se pare ja kar saamaajik sanghathan ke usul main badal detii he
 Lenin used to see the success of the revolution in Russia and its sustainability with the dynamics of world revolution
 isliye unhone duniya bhar main communist partiyon kii sthapana or unki raajnneeti ke maargdarshan ke liye komintern kaa gathan kiya tha
 Comintern also did this
 1921 main sthapit chini communist party uski madad ke bina gathit nahin kii ja sakati thi
 But after Lenin, the role of Comintern changed
 stallin kii dekh-rekh main vishwa-kranti ke hit soviet sangh kii bhu-raajnneetik ranneetiyon ke maatahat hote chale gayi
 The model of Leninism defined by Stalin began to be imposed on the possibilities of revolution in other countries of the world
 china kii communist kranti tabhi safalataa ke raste par chal paayi, jab usne komintern ke madhyam se bheje gayi stallin ke adeshon ko maanane se inkaar kar diya
 Mao Tse-tung accepted Leninism as a guide, but he moved away from the Stalinian interpretation of Leninism
 ek sthiti to yah aayi thi ki maao ne komintern ke pratinidhiyon se milane tak se inkaar kar diya tha
 It is a historical fact that at the time Mao was proclaiming the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Soviet Union had entered into a treaty with Kuomingtang and its leader, anti-communist leader Chiang Kai-shek
 maao ne baad main stallin kii aalochana karte hue kaha bhi ki ve kranti ko 'farji' maanate the
 There are other perspectives of criticism of Stalinian Leninism in which Eurommunism's approach is notable
 marxvad kaa yah sanskaran maanata he ki leninavaad mukhyatah roosi paristhitiyon kii dein hone ke kaaran europee sarvhaara ke sangharsh ke liye praasangik nahin he
 Its advocates believe that instead of doing the politics of violent coup of the capitalist state, the European proletariat can benefit by participating in the capitalist polity to achieve its goals

 ye hai lupin, soy, hempsid, chia seed, amaranth, bak wheat or quinoa
 Although essential amino acids can be obtained by eating a wide variety of complementary vegetable sources, this may be caused by a combination of all eight essential amino acids providing flora; Iron deficiency anemia appears to have no relation to diet

 Oops! 


 i Did It Again and subsequent albums saw Spears working with several contemporary R&B producers and reaching "a combination of Bubblegum, Urban Soul, and Raga"
 Her third album, Brittany, originated from the conceit of teenage pop, "in rhythmic and rhythmic form 


 more intense, tougher than before
 In what used to be an irrepressibly frothy, there's some disco tenacity that spears daring Self-determination that helps sell hooks who, by and large, are already more attractive than the ones who populated their last two albums
 " Her vocals have also been criticized for often contrasting her with her pop rival, Christina Aguilera
 samalochak alan ribal ne sarkas main nirmit digital prabhaav or robot ke prabhaav par uske atinirbharta kaa uphaas kiya he
 “she has never been a strong singer
 

" ribal likhte hai, "kya vah in gaanon ko anaavrutt vyavasthaaon or kisi mukhar prabhaav-hinata ke saath sambhaal sakegi? isse bhi mahatvapurn baat, kya uske aise pradarshan yaa gane ko koi sunanaa chahega? kya isse koi fark padataa he? nahin
 dhyaan abhi bhi mul-vastu par tikaa hua he
 " uske chhavi or vyaktitv bhi praayah christina aguilera ke vipareet he
 David Brown of Entertainment Weekly has observed that "christina Aguilera shows skin and navel but in her music and behavior, she is more inclined not to offend anyone - she's a good girl who is only bad She plays haalanki, spirs acha abhinay karne vaali ek buree ladki maaloom padati he
 

 Spears's gimmicky and melodious voice is far less interesting than the settings, but nonetheless the tenderness of Aguilera's stubborn vocal gymnastics actually works as a relief
 iske vipareet, olmusic ne tipanni kiya he: "apane mitra christina aguilera kii tarah, britaini paardarshee kaamuktha or nite klbon kii tej awaz ke saath paripakvata ko samikrut kar detii he
 

while Christina seems like a born skank, Britney is the girl next door to the cutting loos in college, she drinks so casually and smokes and dances and has little intercourse
 Also, it seems that she can satisfy herself only in this first time
 " slant magazine ke saal singhmaani ne note kiya he ki "aguilera or spirs ke bich kii asamanta ko sirf unqi awaajon kii lay or sargam seemaa se nahin mapa ja saktaa he
 

 Popularity has never reached the pitch of Britney's exaggeration
 yah vyapak rup se bataaya gaya he ki anya nrity-unmukh pop star kii tarah, spirs bhi sangeet samaaroh main lip-sinks karti he
 Writer Gary Giddins, in his book Natural Selection: Gary Giddins on Comedy, Film, Music, and Books, wrote that "artists who move their lips like a machine include Britney Spears, Luciano Pavarotti, Shania Twain, Beyoncé and Madonna" 
 " da balteemor san ke rashod di
 olison ne dekha he: "kai pop staron 


 ko lagata he ki kanth swar ko sudhaarney ke alawa unke paas koi doosraa vikalp nahin he
 Since the advent of MTV and other video music channels, pop viewers have been shown elaborate videos featuring jaw-drooping effects, awesome choreography, great clothing, amazing physique
 or usee str kii purnataa kii apeksha, video set se pare sangeet-samaaroh manch se bhi kii jaati he
 So fans would not pay up to $ 300 for a concert ticket if Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, or Madonna would make a coarse and flat tone without a backing track
 "there were reports that Britney Spears says," Giddins says Fans - despite her disapproval of doing so - prefer her lip-sync more because when they pay more money for a concert When they do, they expect lossless digitization
 " lip-sinking ke prachaar-prasar ko note karte hue, los angeles daily news ne khabar diya he ki "britaini spirs ke ek sangeet-samaaroh ke sandarbh main, kya isse vastav main koi fark padataa he? ek vegas revu sho kii tarah, aap sangeet sunne nahin jate hai, aap sirf iske kuch had tak haasyaaspad tamaashe ke liye jate hai"
 isi tarah, orlando centinel ke elin mendexon ne tipanni kiya he: "ek baat saafe-saafe samaj lo: britaini spirs kaa sangeet-samaaroh sangeet ke liye nahin he
 

 You have to remember that this is about the scene, not the tone

 or, uske jivan kii tarah, yah bhi, kul milakar, ek safalataa he
 Throughout her career, Spears has often been compared to her in the field of vocals, choreography and theater appearances, citing Janet Jackson and Madonna as influences of her work
 usne prerana ke ek strot ke rup main maaikel jackson kaa bhi naam liya he
 According to Spears: "I know that when i was very young, i used to respect people 


 as you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna
 or ve log mere liye bahut badi prerana the
 But i also had my own identity and i knew who i am, you know it
 " carol clerk kii san 2002 kii pustak, madonasteil main, yah kehete hue use uddhrut kiya gaya he: "jab main ek choti ladki thi, tabhi se main madonna kii ek bahut badi prashansak rahi hum

 her choreography definitely paved the way for girls to enter and do something of their own
 " kai aalochakon ne tark diya he ki spirs ko jackson yaa madonna kii bhaanti pratibha qi usee manch yaa kheme kaa nahin mana janaa chahie
 rocky mountain collegian ke patrakaron, erika montalvo or jaiki shaperd ne dekha ki "kuch tark die ja sakate hai ki spirs keval ek acchhee recording kalakaar hi nahin balki ek mahatvapurn saanskrithik pratik bhi he
 "while examining her level of proficiency as an artist, it has been questioned that" although she is classified among outstanding women such as Janet Jackson and Madonna, in fact in addition to Rock's racy, Ms
 Spears's What exactly does it have? "the Boston Globe's Joan Anderman commented that" Madonna's talent or cultural barometer from her thirteen costumes changes in 90 minutes Will not be blessed
 The army of cutting-edge R&B producers will not supply Janet Jackson's sense of humor or serious-smile 


 Britney's heroes are not great singers
 lekin ve asal gayak hai
 Spears' voice is processed by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers, so on her records, her voice sounds almost inhuman, like a robot

 "critic Shane Harrison wrote: The minimalist thump of" I'm a Slave 4 u "and from the feel of" Nasty "to scattered quotes in" Boys ", seems like an attempt at 'control'
 " apane kaam main vyaktigat or saamaajik muddon ko shaamil karne ke liye jackson ke sankalp or udyog main saamaajik drushti se sweekaarya saamagree kii simaaon ko lagaataar phir se paribhaashit karne ke liye madonna kii kshamta kaa uddhran dete hue, tulana karne par spirs kii namasuchee antat feeki pad jaati he kyonki "jahaan jackson or madonna ne mahatva ke vishyon ke bare main apane swayan ke sangeet kii rachana qi, vahiin sangeet 'main badi hona chaahati hum lekin media mujhe banane nahin degi' yaa 'ye kiti, kiti, maine apana undervier apane chamade ke pant ke baahar pahana he' kii tarah ke baildon main se kisi ek ke ek apbit sanskaran kii tarah lagata he

 Although maps of longitude and latitudes were prevalent in the time of the greek-egyptian astrologer Ptolemy before Columbus, and navigational charts with longitudinal and latitude were also propagated, but in the time of Columbus itself, the maps of the earth were made with real maps in mind
 The need was felt

 The mathematical definition of the Earth's surface is given by the surface on the equilateral or even plane, on which, as much as any matter in the Earth and wherever it is, due to the rotation of the gravity and axis of it, the voltage is constant
 ye samavibhav prishth drusht gurutv arthath gurutvkarshan or ghurnan janya apkendri bal ke sanyukt prabhaav, kii disha par lamb honge or sankhya main kitne hi honge inamen se jo madhya sagar tal ke nikatatam he use prithvital mana jaataa he or use bhu samudratlabh, yaa jeeyoid, kehete hai
 The word does not have the sense of being a spheroid of the earth
 isamen keval yahi bhav he ki prithvi "prithvi akruti" vaali he
 The elevation of the points from the spirit is relative to the geoid, not the earthy spheroid
 maanchitr hetu jeeyoid ko aisa golabh maan liya jaataa he jo prithvi ke yaa uske kisi bhaag ke, jisase hamen sarokaar ho, nikatatam ho
 Since the Earth is not perfectly spherical, the size of the Earth has been determined by measuring its various metamorphic arcs and the latitudes of their ends, coordinating all these observations with the least squares principle, or some other such method
 Longitudinal arcs can also be used, but their measurement can be achieved only after the invention of electric telecommunications and is of satisfactory accuracy
 Instead of Rdharn pressure area is being done that is cast method
