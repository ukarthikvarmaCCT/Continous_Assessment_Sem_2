 braille paddati ek tarah kii lipi he, jisko vishwa bhar main netraheenon ko padhane or likhane main chhukar vyavhaar main laayaa jaataa he
 This method was invented in 1821 by Louis Braille, a blind French writer
 yah alag-alag aksharon, sankhyaon or viraam chinhon ko darshaate hai
 When Braille was blind, his father got him admitted to the Royal National Institute for the Blind Children's in Paris
 us skool main "velantin hou" dwaara banaai gai lipi se padhai hoti thi, par yah lipi adhuri thi
 Once in this school, Captain Charles Barbier, an officer of the French army, came for a training and gave a lecture about the "night Writing" or "sonography" script read by the soldiers in the dark
 yah lipi kaagaj par aksharon ko ubharkar banaai jaati thi or isamen 12 binduon ko 6-6 kii do panktiyon ko rakhaa jaataa tha, par isamen viraam chihn, sankhya, ganitiya chihn aadi nahin hote the
 Braille got this idea from Waheem
 lui ne isi lipi par aadhaarit kintu 12 ke sthaan par 6 binduon ke upyog se 64 akshar or chihn vaali lipi banaayi
 Not only punctuation marks but also mathematical symbols and musical notations could be written in it
 yahi lipi aaj sarvamaanya he
 Louis was just 15 when he composed the script
 san 1824 main purna hui yah lipi duniya ke lagbhag sabhi deshon main upyog main laai jaati he
 There are 6 dots in each rectangular cell, which are slightly raised
 yah do panktiyon main bani hoti hai

 Similarly, 4,5,6 are made on the right side

 It has a special technique of reading
 braille lipi ko padhane ke liye andhe bacchon main itnaa gyaan hona aavashyak he ki wo apni ungali ko vibhinn dishaao main cell par ghuma saken
 By the way, there is no standard way of reading it around the world
 braille lipi ko slate par bhi prayog main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Apart from this it can also be presented on Braille typewriter
 aadhunik braille script ko 8 dots ke cell main viksit kar diya gaya he, taaki andhe logon ko adhik se adhik shabdon ko padhane kii suvidha uplabdh ho sake
 The Braille script cell with eight dots now has the ability to read 256 characters, numbers and punctuation marks instead of 64

 In it, some additional points have been added down to the old style
 ab ye 4 bindu ooncha or 2 bindu chaudaa ho gaya he
 The additional points are numbered 7 and 8
 8-bindu code kaa ek laabh ye bhi he ki ek akshar kaa cese sidhe akshar vaali cell main diya jaataa he evam sabhi print hone vaale aski kairactors ek hi cell main likhe ja sakate hai
 All 256 combinations possible by 8-dots are possible in the Unicode standard
 6-bindu vaali braille lipi ko braille aski naan se surakshit rakhaa gaya he
 The first 10 letters of the English alphabet and numbers up to 1–10 are written using only the top four dots
 bindu 3 ke prayog se agle das akshar, bindu 6 se antim chah akshar evam praayah prayogneey angrezi shabd and, for, of, the, and with aadi likhe ja sakate hai
 By removing the letter u from z to point-3 and removing the five word marks, nine digraphs form the letter W
 e, 1 B, 2 si, 3 D, 4 E, 5 F, 6 G, 7 H, 8 I, 9 J, 10 K, 11 L, 12 M, 13 N, 14 O, 15 P, 16 Q, 17 R, 18 S, 19 T, 20 U, 21 V, 22 W, 23 X, 24 Y, 25 Z, 26 aage capital akshar he Is the number next apostrophy full stop coma Semicolon vismayaadibodak chihn Quotation marks, question marks start * uddhran chihn band Bracket * hifan note: * prashnsuchak chihn dikhaane ke liye bindu 2-3-6— prayog kiye jate hai, khulte uddhran chihn ke samaan hi
 Therefore, it is only by writing the points before or after a word that you will know what this sign is
 * khulte va band hote braggit samaan chihn dwa chihnit hai
 Therefore, it will be known only by experiment whether the bracket is opening or closing
 shabd and / AND Letter f / ch akshar SH Letter st / st akshar tha / TH This is just a sample of the contracts used in Grade-2 Braille

 vaad-vivaad yaa bahes, kisi vishay par charchaa kii ek aupchaarik vidhi he
 In the debate, supporters of two opposing views keep their arguments and try to counter the statements of the other
 vaad-vivaad saarvajanik baithkon main ho saktaa he, shaikshanik samsthanon main ho saktaa he, vidhaayi sabhaaon main ho saktaa he
 Debate is a formal discussion in which, apart from the participants, there is usually a moderator and a listener
 taarkik susangati, tathyaatmak parishuddhta, tathaa kuch seemaa tak shrotaaon se bhaavnaatmak judaav vaad-vivaad ke mukhya ang hai
 When a formal debate competition is held, rules are also made for discussing and resolving mutual differences
 pratiyogi vaad-vivaad, anya tiimon ke saath vaad-vivaad karne ke liye yojit hota he, jo sthaneey, rashtriya or antarrashtriya str par pratispardhaa kar rahe hote hai
 It is popular in English-speaking universities and high schools worldwide, particularly South Africa, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand
 Many different styles of debate exist under different organizations and rules
 skulon or collejon main, aksar, yah spasht niyamon ke saath ek pratiyogita kaa rup le letaa he
 In this, one or more judges can preside

 Further illustrating the importance of the rules, those who are in opposition must necessarily refute these arguments, adequately adopting that proposition

 sansadeey bahes ko british sansadeey prakriya se praapt niyamon ke tahat yojit kiya jaataa he
 It presents a contest of individuals in a multi-person setting
 isane kuch shabdon jaise "government" or "oposishan" ko british sansad se liya he kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he)
 Worldwide, there is parliamentary debate known as "debate" in most countries and is the primary style practiced in the United Kingdom, Australia, India, Greece and most other countries
 duniya main sansadeey vaad-vivaad kii pramukh ghatana world uniwarsities dibeting championships, kaa aayojan british sansadeey style main kiya jaataa he
 Even within the United Kingdom, the 'british Parliamentary' style is not exclusively used; The English-speaking association runs national championships in a unique format for schools, called the 'mess' format based on the name of the competition, while simultaneously using the British parliamentary format for national university competitions
 goes
 sanyukt rajya america main america sansadeey vaad-vivaad association, sabase purana rashtriya sansadeey vaad-vivaad sanghathan he, jo east coast par aadhaarit he or isamen saare ivi lig shaamil hai, yadhyapi adhik haal main sthapit rashtriya vaad-vivaad sansadeey sangh ab sabase badi colejiet praayojak he

 In parliamentary debate, the subject can either be determined by the tournament or determined by the debaters, as the "official" side begins
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi vishay "yah sabha saanskrithik citon ko nasht karegi" tha, to sarkaar ise kisi bhi tarah se paribhaashit kar sakati he jaisaa vah upyukt samajhati he, udhaaharan ke liye, keval yuddh kaal ke dauraan or dharmik saanskrithik sthalon ko chhodkar

 In many forms of this activity, rhetoric and style, as well as more traditional knowledge and research, can play an important role in determining the winner where points are shared equally between issue and manner
 ise vyapak rup se vaad-vivaad kaa sabase loktantric rup qaraar diya gaya he
 This style of debate is prominent at the school level in Britain
 do vaad-vivaad kii do timen ek samarthak prastaav, jiskaa ek dal samarthan karegaa or doosraa virodh
 prayek vaktaa ek saat minute kaa bhaashan is kram main degaa; pratham prastaav, pratham vipaksh, dwitiya prastaav, dwitiya vipaksh
 prayek bhaashan ke pratham minute ke baad, vipaksh ke sadsy "jaankaree ke bindu" kaa anurodh kar sakate hai
 If the speaker accepts they are allowed to ask a question
 POI kaa istemaal, vaktaa ko uske kisi kamjor bindu par khinchne ke liye kiya jaataa he, yaa vaktaa dwaara die gaye kisi vaktavy ke khilaaf vaad-vivaad karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 However after 6 minutes, POI is not allowed
 sabhi chaar vyaktiyon ke bol lene ke baad, vaad-vivaad baithak ke liye khul jaataa he, jisamen darshakon ke sadsy, dal ke liye sawaal rakhte hai
 After the debate of the meeting, one speaker from each team will speak for 4 minutes
 In these summary speeches, it is common for the speaker to answer the questions raised by the meeting before answering the key points, and to answer any questions posed by the opposition
 mess formet main, aamtaur par jor vishleshnatmak kaushal, manoranjan, style or tark kii takat par diya jaataa he
 The winning team generally excelled in all these areas
 This style of debate is particularly popular in Ireland at Secondary School level
 Developed in Coláiste Iognáid over the last ten years, the format has five speakers: two teams and a single 'sweep speaker' on each side
 Speaches last 4'30' with 30' seconds protected from pois at either end of the debate
 Adjudication will depend on BP marking, but with particular recognition of principled debating
a ten minute open house will also be adjudicated
 Traditionally, the motion is always opposed in the final vote
 Inaugurated on February 15, 1997, at St
 Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas, the International Public Debate Association is a national debate league currently in Arkansas, Louisiana, Kansas, Alabama, Texas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Washington, Oregon, Idaho is active in Florida and Oklahoma
 vishvavidhyalayon main, sanyukt rajya america main IPDA sabase teji se bad rahaa vaad-vivaad sangh he
 Although evidence is used, the main focus of the IPDA is to promote a format of debate that emphasizes public speech and real-world persuasion skills rather than the robust use of evidence and motion
 is lakshya ko aage karne ke liye, IPDA mukhya rup se saadhaaran nirnaayakon kaa upyog karata he taaki ek darshak kendrit vaad-vivaad style ko protsaahit kiya ja sake
 In addition, although the main goal of the debate is to persuade the adjudicator, the IPDA also awards the best speakers in each tournament
 IPDA donon team vaad-vivaad pradaan karata he jahaan do alag alag vaad-vivaad timen or vyakti vaad-vivaad karte hai
 In both party and personal debate, a list of topics is given to both sides thirty minutes before the start of the round
 ek vishay ko lene ke liye ek joardaar bahes hoti he
 Both sides prepare an opening speech, a cross-examination of the other side and final remarks for the round, one that is ratifying the proposal and the other that opposing the proposal
 jabaki antarrashtriya saarvajanik vaad-vivaad association ke adhikansh sadsy kaarykram, collejon yaa vishvavidhyalayon se jude hue hai, IPDA toornament main bhagidaari un sabhi ke liye khuli hui he jinka shiksha str saatvin ke baraabar yaa upar he
 The Australasia style debate is made up of two parties who debate an issue, more commonly called a subject or proposal
 parampara dwaara, yah mudda ek samarthak vaktavy ke rup main prastut hota he jisaki shuruyaat "ki" se hoti he, udhaaharan ke liye, "ki kute, billiyon se behatar hai," yaa "yah sabha", udhaaharan ke liye, "yah sadan ek vishwa sarkaar sthapit karegi"
 muddon ke vishay kshetra ke anusaar bhinn hote hai
 However, most topics are usually region-specific so that they are easily of interest to both participants and their audience
 prayek team main teen sadsy hote hai, jinamein se prayek kaa namakaran unke dal ke anusaar or team main unke bolne kii sthiti ke anusaar kiya jaataa he
 For example, the second speaker of the support team is called "second pro speaker" or "second opposition speaker", depending on the terminology used
 The position of each speaker is based around a specific role, for example the third speaker has the opportunity to refute the argument of the opposing team and add new evidence to their position
 The last speaker is called "team Advisor / Captain"
 is style kaa prayog karte hue, vaad-vivaad, prayek team ke prayek pehle vaktaa dwaara ek samaapan tark ke saath samaapt hota he or nae saboot nahin bhi pesh kiye ja sakate hai
 Each of the six speakers speaks one after the other, starting with the supporting team
 bolne kaa kram is prakaar he: pehla samarthak, pehla vipakshi, doosraa samarthak, doosraa vipakshi, teesraa samarthak or antat teesraa vipakshi
 The contexts in which the Australasia style debate is used is different, but in Australia and New Zealand it is mostly used at the primary and secondary school levels, ranging from small informal one-off inter-school debates to multiple rounds
 And a final series that takes place over a year is used in larger formal inter-school competitions
 WUPID ek aamantran toornament he jo BP yaa vaad-vivaad ke world praaroop kaa prayog karata he
 It invites the top 30 debating institutions according to the list provided by the World Debate website administered by Com Flynn
 yadi koi athwa kuch timen hissaa nahin le paati hai to sheersh 60 tiimon se kisi pratisthaapan ko chunaa jayega yaa jo vishvavidhyalay vaad-vivaad samudaay ke varisht sadasyon kii majboot siforeeshon ke aadhaar par hoga
 WUPID was first held in December 2007, with the University of Sydney becoming the champion
 agle saal 2008 main monesh ne trophy ko apane naam kiya
 The third WUPID will be held in December 2009 at the University of Putra Malaysia
 The first two tournaments were co-organized by Kuala Lumpur University
 WUPID, dainiel hasani mustafa, saful amin jaloon or mohammad younus zakaaria ke dimag kii upaj tha
 All of them were former debaters of the UPM who competed at all possible levels from the Malaysian national to the debates to the World Championship
 yah asia main sabase bada vaad-vivaad toornament he jahaan timen vaad-vivaad karne ke liye madhya-purv se lekar japan tak se aati he
 It is traditionally held in south-east Asia, where participation is generally highest compared to other parts of Asia
 asian vaad-vivaad, mote taur par australysian praaroop kaa ek roopaantar he
 The only difference is that each speaker is given 7 minutes of speech time and there will be 2 to 6 minutes of speech where the point of information will be offered by the opposition team
 This means that the first and seventh minutes are considered 'safe' periods where no pois can be presented in front of the speaker
 vaad-vivaad, pradhanmantri ke bhaashan ke saath shuru hoga or pehle vipaksh dwaara jari rakhaa jayega 
 baari-baari kaa yah bhaashan tisare vipakshi tak chalata rahegaa
 iske baad, vipakshi bench javaabi bhaashan denge
 In a counter-speech, the opposition moves first and then the motion
 The debate ends when the motion ends the counter-speech
 javaabi bhaashan ke liye 4 minute abantit kiye jate hai or is dauraan koi POI pesh nahin kii ja sakati he
 Policy debate is a style of debate where two parties of two disputants oppose or oppose a plan that comes out of a proposal usually introduced by the government to change a policy
 timen saamaanya rup se baari-baari se or vibhinn daur ke antargat yaa to "samarthak" yaa "vipaksh" ke rup main pratispardhaa karti hai
 In most forms of this activity, there is a fixed subject for the whole year or for another fixed period
 sansadeey vaad-vivaad kii tulana main, niti vaad-vivaad, shodh sabooton par adhik nirbhar hota he or isamen uchit tark kaa ek vistrut kshetra sammilit hota he, jisamen shaamil hoti he javaabi-yojana, aalochanatmak siddhant or khud gatividhi ke saidhantik maanakon par vaad-vivaad
 jabaki vaktruta mahatvapurn he or prayek vivadakarta ko die gaye "vaktaa ke bindu" main jhalkati he, prayek daur kaa faisla aamtaur par is baat par aadhaarit hota he ki prastut kiye gaye saboot or tark ke anusaar kisne tark "jeeta"
 iske alaava, gatividhi ke kuch kshetron main, vivadakarta "gati" badha sakate hai, taaki adhik se adhik sambhav saboot or jaankaree saamne rakh saken or duusare paksh kaa jawaab de saken
 log, pratidwandvi ko "mook" karne karne kii koshish main teevr gati se padhate hai
 In effect, the disputant presents so much information spanning multiple topics, that the opponent does not have time to respond to everything and they have to ignore some of the arguments on which the original team then focuses
 niti vaad-vivaad kaa abhyaas zyaadaatar sanyukt rajya america main kiya jaataa he, haalanki ise europe or japan main bhi aajamaaya gaya or isane nishchit rup se vaad-vivaad ke anya roopon ko prabhavit kiya he
 Some people see its development as a development towards a more esoteric style
 shastreey vaad-vivaad, apekshaakrit ek nayaa vaad-vivaad praaroop he, jise sabase pehle minesota rajya main banaaya or mukhya rup se prayog kiya gaya
 It was formed as an alternative to policy debate
 kuch nirnaayakon or kochon ne mahasoos kiya ki niti vaad-vivaad ke vikaas ne ise ek bahut hi vishesh rup kii bahes bana diya he, jahaan bolne kii gati samaj se pare hoti he or "samrik" tarkon par dhyaan kendrit karte hue vaastavik duniya ke tarkon par kam jor daalaa jaataa he jo aksar lagbhag betuka hota he
 With a structure similar to policy, classical debate emphasizes logic and real-world discussion
 is kaaran se, ise aksar "halki niti" kaa upnaam diya jaataa he
 Contrary to policy, where each supporter proposes a new plan, classical debate is simple: a motion is chosen at the beginning of the session, backed by supporters and opposed by the opposition
 pratibandh dwaara pradaan kiya gaya failaav ke bajaay gaharaai par jor, rochak daur ko janm detaa he jo aksar tark main parivartit ho jaataa he or jo anyathaa anya praroopon main kamjor bana rahata
 Unconstrained debate is a style in which there is no advance preparation and there are two teams of first and second speakers
 jabaki adhikansh nirnaayak, vivadakartaaon ko samasamyik ghatnaon or vibhinn aankadon ko uddhrut karne kii anumati dete hai ekmaatr anusandhan jisaki anumati he vah he ek yaa ek se adhik lekh jise vivadakarta ko vaad-vivaad se thodaa pehle prastaav ke saath diya jaataa he
 It begins with a constructive speech by the first supporting speaker, followed by the opposition; Then the second round of pro and opposition starts respectively
 inamen se prayek bhaashan chah minute lambaa hota he or jiske baad do minute kaa paar-pareekshan hota he
 This is then followed by pro and opposition first speaker rebuttal and one opposition and pro second speaker rebuttal respectively
 ye bhaashan chaar minute lambey hote he
 No new points can be brought into debate during the rebuttal
 is style kaa vaad-vivaad mukhya teen vivaadon par kendrit hota he, haalanki ek team do yaa chaar kaa bhi upyog kar sakati he
 To win the pro side, all opposition arguments need to be defeated and supporter arguments upheld
 ek vaad-vivaad main prastut adhikansh jaankaree ko in tarkon main se ek kaa samarthan karne ke liye bandhaa hua hona chahie yaa "sin posted" hona chahie
 Uncertain debate is quite similar to policy debate; One main difference, however, is that undue debate places less emphasis on the implementation of the motion
 linkan-duglas vaad-vivaad, mukhya rup se sanyukt rajya america main ucch vidhyalay ke vaad-vivaad kaa ek rup he jise 1858 ke linkan-duglas vaad-vivaad ke aadhaar par naam diya gaya he, yah ek-par-ek kaarykram he jo vaastavik duniya ke muddon par mukhya rup se darshanik siddhanton ko lagu karne par dhyaan kendrit karta he
 Disputants usually turn their sides alternately in different rounds, which is either the "support" that confirms the motion, or the "opponent" that denies it
 yah prastaav, jo har do maheene main badalata he, yah sawaal khadaa karata he ki kya ek khaas niti yaa karrwai ek vishisht mulya ke anuroop he
 Although, it is established as an alternative to policy debate, there exists a strong movement to adopt certain techniques born in policy debate
 khud is gatividhi or saidhantik aadhaar ke bare main yojanaayen, javaabi-yojanaayen, aalochanatmak siddhant, uttar-aadhunik siddhant or samalochanaayen, yadi saarvbhaumik rup se nahin, to bhi aakasmik prayog se adhik pahunchi hai
 Traditional LD debate attempts to be free from the "terminology" of policy debate
 linkan-duglas bhaashan, ek sanvaadi gati se lekar 300 wpm se adhik tak ho saktaa he 
 This technique is known as motion
 carded saboot par jor bad rahaa he, haalanki abhi bhi niti vaad-vivaad kii tulana main kam hi he
 These trends have created a serious rift within this activity between disputants, adjudicators, and coaches who oppose or accept these changes and those who strongly oppose it
 niti or linkan-duglas vaad-vivaad toornament aksar ek hi skool main hai samavarti yojit kiya jaataa he
 The Karl Popper debate, named after the famous philosopher, is a widely used debate format in Eastern European and Central Asian high schools
 mul rup se, ek adhik lacheele daleey vaad-vivaad praaroop ke rup main open sosayadi santhaan dwaara banaaya gaya karl poper vaad-vivaad, aise pehle praaroop ke rup main kaaphi lokapriy hua he, jise kai ucch vidhyalay ke chaatr sikhte hai
 It focuses on a consistent and often deeply divisive proposition, emphasizing the development and tolerance of critical thinking skills for differing viewpoints
 in lakshyon ko aasaan banane ke liye, vivadakarta teen dalon ke rup main ek saath kaam karte hai or har mudde ke donon pakshon kaa anusandhan karte hai
 Constructed in a manner similar to the lincoln-douglas debate format, each party has the opportunity to argue before the opposition party and ask questions directly
 prayek paksh ke pehle vaktaaon ke paas apane rachanaatmak maamalon ko rakhane ke liye 6 minute kaa samay hota he, yaa vipakshi ke maamle main ek khandan rakhane kaa
 anya 4 vaktaaon main se prayek ke paas apni team ke mukhya tark ke samarthan main bhaashan dene ke liye 5 minute kaa samay hota he
 After the first 4 speeches, 3 minutes have been allocated for cross-examination, during which the opposition party has the opportunity to clarify the statements stated in the preceding speech
 har saal, antarrashtriya vaad-vivaad shiksha sangh ek vaarshik yuva manch yojit karata he, jiske dauraan, karl poper vishwa championships bhi yojit hoti he
 Countries from all over the world participate in this forum for this tournament as well as a 2-week debate training camp
 ucch vidhyalay vaad-vivaad kaarykram jaise chaatr congress, model united neshans, european youth parliament, junior state of america or american lemons boys state or girl state kaarykram, aisi gatividhiyaan hai jo ek chhadam vidhayika kii nakal ke aadhaar par chalati hai
 Ashu debate is a relatively informal style of debate compared to other highly structured formats
 vaad-vivaad ke liye vishay ko vaad-vivaad shuru hone se pandraa se bees minute ke bich main pratibhaagiyon ko diya jaataa he
 The nature of the debate is relatively simple; Each member speaks for five minutes, alternating from each side
 anya swaroopon ke samaan ek das minute kii charchaa avadhi, "mukt paar-parikshan" shuru hoti he or uske baad ek paanch minute kaa antaraal 
 After the interval, each team gives a 4-minute rebuttal
 united kingdom main naishanal mooting championships angreji bhashi sangh dwaara chalaai jaati he
 The public forum combines aspects of both the lincoln-douglas Debate and the Policy Debate, but the length of the speech is short and long, which is known as the "cross-fire" of dialogue between the disputants
 sanyukt rajya america main hai skool vaad-vivaad main rashtriya forencik lig dwaara isaki shuruuaat karne se lekar yah, vivadakartaaon or darshakon, donon ke bich apni pahunch ke kaaran kaaphi lokapriy hua kyonki iskaa jor saral taarkik anunay par hota he or vaastavik duniya ke tark or vaktruta kaushal ke vikaas main madad karne ke kaaran bhi
 It is a new, particularly French form
 kisi die gaye prastaav par paanch vaad-vivaad kii do timen
 ek paksh prastaav kaa bachaav karata he jabaki anya use haarane kii puri koshish karata he
 The debate is judged on the basis of quality of argument, strength of speech, charisma of the speaker, quality of humor, ability to think immediately and of course to act in solidarity

 Heart rate is measured by detecting the pulse of the body
 This pulse rate can be measured at any point in the body - where the pulsation of an artery is transmitted to the surface - often when it is pressed against a piece of bone-like structure below it - with the index finger and middle finger
 is
 Thumb should not be used to measure the heart rate of any other person, because his powerful pulse can obstruct the pulse of that place
 hryday kii dar ko maapne ke liye sambhavit bindu nimna hai: a more accurate method of measuring pulse uses an electrocardiograph, or ECG
 In many medical conditions, especially in critical auscultation, the heart is undergoing continuous electrocardiographic care
 Commercial heart rate monitors are also available, which consist of a bust of electrodes
 a signal is transmitted to be shown to a customer on the wrist
 Heart rate monitors constantly make accurate measurements and can be used during exercise because it is difficult or impossible to measure by hand at that time

 The music tempo terms present corresponding levels of resting heart rate, with adagio 66–77 beats per minute, similar to human resting heart rates, while lento and largo are 40–60 beats per minute, indicating that These temperatures are slower than normal human heart rates
 Similarly, faster temps relate to higher levels of labor, such as Andante and the like

 Expensive equipment may be required to perform the maximum exercise test
 People starting the exercise regime are generally advised to take such examination only under medical supervision due to the risks related to high heart rate
 For general purposes, instead of this, people use a formula to estimate their individual maximum heart rate
 aayu par aadhaarit, vyaktigat adhiktam hryday daron kaa anumaan karne ke liye vibhinn sutron kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, lekin vibhinn vyaktiyon ke bich adhiktam hryday daren kaaphi bhinn hoti hai

hascale ne yah kehete hue "hansi udayi" thi ki ise "kabhi bhi logon ke prashikshan ke shashan ke liye param maardarshak nahin samajha gaya tha
" Even though most common, this formula is not considered a good indicator of heart rate by reputable health and fitness professionals
 Despite the extensive publication of this sutra, two decades of research has revealed its major inherent error
 As a result, heart-rate = 220 — the estimate calculated by age has neither accuracy nor scientific justification for use in the physiology of exercise and related fields
 2002 main kiye gaye hriday-darmax ke 43 vibhinn sutron ke ek adhyayan main nimna nishkarsh nikaala gaya: The formulas often cited are as follows - 2007 main, ockland vishvavidhyalay ke shodhakon ne 25 varshon kii avadhi main har varsh ricard kii gai 132 vyaktiyon kii adhiktam hryday daron kaa vishleshan kiya or ek rekhiy sameekaran utpann kiya jo tanaaka ke sutara –hriday-darmax = 206
9 − —or ek arekhiy sameekaran—hriday-darmax = 191
5 − ke bahut samaan tha
 is rekhiy sameekaran kaa aashwastata antaraal ±5–8 dhadkan prati minute tha or arekhiy sameekaran kii adhik chust shrenee ±2–5 dhadkan prati minute thi
 ek tisare arekhiy sameekaran kaa vikaas bhi kiya gaya—hriday-darmax = 163 + − 
 These figures are mostly average and depend largely on individual physiology and fitness
 For example, the rates of an endurance runner would normally be lower due to the increased heart size required for exercise, while the slightly farther runners would have higher rates due to better coping time and shorter duration, etc
 - each predicted heart Rates can be 180, but the actual maximum heart rates of these two people can vary by 20 beats

" In 2010, research done at Northwestern University amended the formula for maximum heart rate for women
 According to Martha Gulati and others it is as follows - lund, sweden main kiye gaye ek adhyayan main ullekith aankade diye gaye hai, purushon ke liye- And for women - lakshya hriday dar, yaa prashikshan hriday dar vatajivi vyaayaam ke samay praapt hriday kii vah apekshit dar kii shrenee he jo kisi vyakti ke hriday or fefdon ko vyaayaam se adhiktam laabh arjeet karne main sahaayak hoti he
 yah shrenee vyakti kii shaareerik avasthaa, ling or bhootpurv abhyaas ke anusaar bhinnata rakhti he

 lekin, in gananaaon ke arthpurna hone ke liye sateek hriday-darmax jaananaa aavashyak he 
 Example of someone with a heart rate of 180, 65% intensity-) x0

 Example of someone with a heart rate of 180: area 1: 180 - 50 ± 5 → 125 - 135 beats per minute
 Area 4: 180 - 20 ± 5 → 155 - 165 beats per minute hriday dar bhandar kisi vyakti kii maapi hui yaa anumaanit adhiktam hriday dar tathaa vishramiya hriday dar ke bich ke antar ke liye prayukt ek pad he

 hriday daraar kaa pratishat vio2 bhandar ke baraabar hota he
 It is the rate of heart rate measured in a given period of time after stopping the activity, usually it is measured in a period of 1 minute
 vyaayaam ke baad hriday kii dar main dhire-dhire kami aana hriday ke vikaar kaa sanket ho saktaa he
 yadi hriday kii dar vyaayaam ko rokane ke ek minute baad 12 dhadkan prati minute se kam gire to yah hridayaghat ke adhik jokham kaa sanket ho saktaa he
 Practice regimes sometimes use recovery heart rate as a guide to progress and to address problems such as overheating or dehydration
 Even after short periods of hard exercise, it may take a long time for the heart rate to fall to resting levels
 sharir kriya vigyaan or aushadhishastra kii maanak pathyapustakon main kaha gaya he ki hridaygati kii dar kii gananaa isiji se badi aasaani se nimna tarah se kii ja sakati he: Heart rate = 1500 / RR interval in mm, heart rate = 60 / RR interval in seconds, or heart rate = 300 / number of large squares located between two r waves
 In every case, the authors are actually pointing to an instant heart rate, which is the number of heart beats when RR intervals remain constant
 vishram ke samay100 dhadkan prati minute se adhik kii dhadkan kii dar ko hridkshiprata kaha jaataa he

 The definition of heartburn is that the rate of heartbeat is less than 60 beats per minute although no symptoms are detected when a human is in complete rest, at a rate of less than 50 beats per minute
 Slow resting pulsation rates are found in exercised athletes and it is not uncommon for athletes to have slow palpitations during rest if there are no symptoms associated with it
 This number may vary because children and small-sized
 Adults have a faster heartbeat than average adults

 Arrhythmias are abnormalities of the heartbeat and rhythm
 They can be divided into two major categories - fast and slow beats
 Some of these cause very few or minimal symptoms
 Other more severe symptoms such as lightheadedness, vertigo, and fainting are produced
 yadi fail ho rahe hriday kii sahaayta ke liye nilayi sahaayta upkaran yaa viedi laga di gai ho to koi dhadkan yaa nabj nahin pai jaati he kyonki yah ek anwarat bahaav pump hota he
 Numerous experiments have indicated that faster resting beats have emerged as a new risk factor for mortality in thermodynamic mammals, especially cardiovascular mortality in humans
 With rapid heartbeat, in addition to greater mechanical pressure on the heart, there may be more production of inflammation molecules and more production of reactive oxygen species in the cardiovascular system
 Increased relaxation and cardiovascular risk are interrelated
 It should be understood that this is seen not as an exercise of the allocation of heart beats, but as an increased risk to the system at an increased rate

 He was a Bengali poet
 aaryasptshati naamak muktak kavitaaon kaa sangrah govardhan kii kriti maani jaati he
 In Jayadeva's Geetgovind, Govardhanacharya has been called Rasasiddha poet
 jayadev, ballalasen ke putr lakshmanasen ke samay bengal ke ek suprasiddh bhakt kavi ho gaye hai
 There were five gems in Lakshmansen's assembly, such fame is well known
 un paanch ratnon main govardhanacharya kaa naam bhi gina jaataa he
 Therefore, Govardhanacharya must have been a contemporary poet of Jayadeva and since Jayadeva mentions Govardhan as a well-known poet, Govardhan must have gained Jaydev's earlier fame
 lakshmanasen kaa kaal barahavin sadi kaa uttarardh mana jaataa he or yahi govardhan kaa bhi kaal thahartaa he
 Govardhan was a Bengali poet - his birth or residence must have been Bengal, there is little scope for doubt
 parantu iske atirikt govardhan ke bare main or koi jaankaree hamen nahin he
 a collection of Muktak poems called Aryasaptashati is considered to be the work of Govardhan
 isamen 700 aryaayein sangrahit honi chahie parantu vibhinn sanskarnon main aryaaon kii sankhya 760 tak pahunch gai he
 Therefore, it is difficult to say that the available Aryasaptashati is devoid of intercepts
 madhyayug main yah sangrah kaaphi lokapriy tha or uski aryaaon kii chaaya lekar bahut si footkar rachanaayen likhi gayi
 The "satsai" of the Bihari poet is heavily influenced by this collection
 aaryasptshati main hi yah ullekh miltaa he ki jo shringarras kii dhara praakrit main hi uplabdh thi usko sanskrit main avatarit karne ke liye yah prayaas kiya gaya he
 The allusion here is to the recent "gathasaptashati"
 haal ne praakrit gaathaon main shringarparak rachanaayen nibaddh kii he
 Govardhan idealized these gathas as his Aryans
 praakrit kaa gaathachand, sanskrit ke aryaalandon ke adhik nikat he at: govardhan ne aryaachand ko hi rachana ke liye chunaa
 Govardhan often imitates the hall not only in the verses but also in the imagery
 parantu isse yah nahin samajhnaa chahie ki aaryasptshati, gathasptshati kaa sanskrit anuwaad maatr he
 Whenever Govardhan wants to express the feeling of a saga, he does not miss the performance of his original talent in it
 at: aaryaspshati gathasptshati se sthoolrup main prabhavit hote hue bhi apane aapmen mailic he
 Govardhan is considered as Acharya for the expression of Shringar
 inako rachanaaon main shringaar kaa uddaam rup khulkar aayaa he
 At some places, nude depictions create excitement due to their nakedness
 ek jagah to govardhan ne prem main shav ke chumban kii bhi baat kahi he
 But Govardhanacharya can be counted in Satkavis due to the intensity of expression, ornamentation, and severity of euphemism
