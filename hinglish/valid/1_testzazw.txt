10 main snaatak ke vraton kii charchaa kii gayi he
 In this Dharmasutra, all the rules of any subject are not abolished at one place, but the same subject has been discussed in different chapters
 yatha-uttaradhikaar, praayshchit, shuddhi, putr-bhed tathaa anadhyaay bhinn-bhinn sthalon par charchit hai
 * boudhayan dharmasutra kii bhashaa panini purv prathit hoti he
 There are also many non-apocalyptic uses available in it
 yah sutaragranth gadhy-padyamay he
 There are also long gospel passages and small sutras similar to the style of Brahmin texts
 is dharmasutra main anek vedamantra sampoorn rup main* yaa aanshik* rup main uddhrut hai
 The Vedic mantras or mantras have been instructed by 'iti Shruti:' and 'iti Vigyanate'
 'athapyudahranti' kahkar anek shlokon ko isamen uddhrut kiya gaya he
 Boudhayans often cast their votes only after presenting the opposing vote
 is sutaragranth kii style anya dharmasutron kii apeksha saral he
 * Govindaswamy has pointed out the fact that Boudhayan is not very popular
 vibhaajan kii ast-vyastata ke kaaran aisa mana jaataa he ki samay-samay par isamen parivartan evam parivardhan kiye jate rahe hai, jis kaaran is dharmasutra kaa kuch ansh prakshipt he
 As the fourth question appears to be added later
 iske chaar adhyyon main praayshchitt kaa vivechan kiya gaya he, jiskaa pratipaadan pehle hi dwitiya prashn ke pratham adhyay main 'athaat: praayshchittani'* kahkar diya gaya he
 In the Boudhayana Dharmasutra, the names of Hiranyakeshi, Aapastamb and Karma Boudhayana were mentioned
 * punarapi hiranyakeshi shrautasutra ke bhashyakaar mahadev ne boudhayan ko aapstamb se pracheen mana jaataa he
 Baudhayana has mentioned Gautama twice in his Dharmasutra * and has taken many sutras of the 19th chapter of Gautama Dharmasutra as jy-ka-tya and many sutras in his Dharmasutra as a later
 at: boudhayan dharmasutra nishchit rup se gautam dharmasutra se parvarti rachana he
 Similarly, there is similarity in many places between the Buddhist and the Apastamb Dharmasutras
 aapstamb main praapt kai sutron ko boudhayan 'iti' lagaakar uddhrut karte hai
 This proves that Boudhayan has taken these sutras from Aastambha
 aapstamb kii bhashaa tathaa style adhik avyavasthit he, saath hi isamen puraane arthon main hi shabdon kaa prayog kiya gaya he
 On this basis, Apastamb is considered to be predecessor to Baudhayana
 buhalar boudhayan ko aapstamb se purvavarti maanate hai
 He argues that the opinion propounded by Apastamb is superior to that of Boudhayana and that Apastamb has also criticized Boudhayan's views
 boudhayan dharmasutra main pratipaadit vishyon ko sankshep main is prakaar spasht kiya ja saktaa he- The personal and social ethos and duties of a person have been given a detailed discussion in the Boudhayan Dharmasutra
 bhartiya samskruti kaa aadhaar varna-vyavastha rahi he
 This Dharmasutra highlights in detail the duties of all varnas and ashrams
 boudhayan ke anusaar brahman kaa kartavya vedadhyayan, daan lenaa-dena tathaa yajna karnaa he
 Along with Vedhyayana, performing Yajna, donating, protecting creatures are the duties of Kshatriyas and the duties of study, Yajna, agriculture, trade and animal husbandry are the duties of the Vaishyas
 shudra kaa keval ek hi kartavya he teenon varnon kii seva karnaa
 Although ordinarily these works have been constituted, but there is also a systematic order in them - as in 1-5-10, Brahmins are also allowed to cultivate
 isi prakaar vishesh sthiti main brahman tathaa vaisya ko bhi shastr grahan karne kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he
 At one place, it has also been said that cattle ranchers, traders, people who work in Bhrishti and usurers should behave like Brahmins like Shudras
 * vaisya sood par dhan de saktaa he kintu adhik byaaj lenaa paap he
 * is dharmasutra main manushya jivan ko brahmacharya, grihasth, vanprastha tathaa parivrajak ke rup main chaar ashramon main vibhakt karke pruthak-pruthak sabake kartavya ginaye gayi hai
 Whatever is said in the rules of Brahmacharya in respect of begging of Brahmachari, Yajnopaveet, Sandhya, Achaman, Anadhyaya etc
 is very similar to the duties of Brahmachari specified in the present Manusmriti
 itnaa hi nahin, apitu aise anek shloke bhi boudhayan dharmasutra main uplabdh hote hai, jo ki manusmriti main bhi vidyaman hai
 Like other scriptures for the householder, Boudhayan has also considered eight marriages
 * grihasthashram se purv vidya samaapt karke teen prakaar ke snaatakon kaa ullekh yahan par kiya gaya he- For the householder, Boudhayan has constituted five Mahayagya as Devyagya, Pitriya, Bhootyagya, Manayagya and Brahmayagya and called them Mahasatra
 swadhyay par paryaapt bal diya gaya he, yahan tak ki use brahmayajna kaha gaya he
 Along with Swadhyaya, legislation of Gayatri-chanting, Pranayama and Sandhyopasana has also been done here
 sutarakaar kaa in kriyaaon par sambhavat: isliye bal he ki ye kaary vyakti ko sanhmaarg kii ore prerit karte hai
 Ten types of initiation have been done here for Vaikhanas i

 yadhyapi boudhayan ne vivaah ke vividh niyam bana kar stri-purushon kii kampravriti ko uchit disha dene kaa ytn kiya he, tathaapi unhen pataa he ki kumargamiyon dwaara samaaj main aniatik sambandh bhi punap jate hai
 Keeping this in mind, Baudhayana has enumerated many types of children - Kanin, Adoption, Artificial, Disobedient, Sibling, Crete and Pauravabha
 inamen se kuch par vichaar karnaa aavashyak he
 a son born to an unmarried girl is called Kanin
 prathit hota he ki samaaj main tab aise putr ko sweekaar kar liya jaataa tha
 Panini has also created a formula for this
 * vivaah kaal main garbhini ke udar main surakshit putr sahopha kehalaata he
 The children born to a husband other than the clib or fallen husband were called Poonarbhava
 * isse niyog pratha kii ore sanket miltaa he
 All the above sons were officers of the jurisdiction
 vyabhichaar ke liye boudhayan kathortam dand kaa vidhaan karte hai, yahan tak ki agni main jivit jala dene kaa bhi
 Four, three and two wives have also been ordained for Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya in the Boudhayan Dharmasutra
 shudra ke liye keval ek patni hi vihit he
 * Although this is not a high ideal, there is also a bias towards characters; But it is possible that all these things can be accepted in the society at that time
 isi prasang main boudhayan ne varnsankaron kaa ullekh bhi kiya he
 In the ninth chapter of the first question of this Dharmasutra, the children born of the inverse marriage are called by many names like chandala, rathakara, poultry, vaidek, shwpak, parashava, nishad * that all are varnasankar children who are born out of the interrelations of varna 
 prathit hota he ki boudhayan dharmasutra kii rachana ke samay samaaj main ukt avasthaa utpann ho rahi thi
 The Vedic decorum of marriage was being broken and new castes were being formed due to varna blackness
 dharmasutron ne in sabko saamaajik manyata dene kaa upkram kiya jisase ki inaki upeksha na hone paae tathaa kisi rup main saamaajik bandhan bhi bana rahe
 Like Gautama, Boudhayana also believes that man indulges in evil deeds
 * etdarth boudhayan ne anek prakaar ke praayshchiton tathaa chandrayan aadi vraton kaa vidhaan kiya he jisase vyakti apane paap–bhaar ko chhodkar punah sanhmaarg–gami ban sake
 In this context, they have also counted the pathas and the hypocrites and punished them for all
 inamen se kai dand to atyant kathor hai – yatha – surapan kaa dand jalati hui sura pikar sharir ko jalaana he
 In the Manusmriti, this punishment has been done in this way
 sambhavtah kathor dand isliye he jisase vyakti paap–maarg main pravrutt hi na ho sake
 Boudhayan has distinguished against all the varnas for the same crime
 brahman ke liye yadhyapi kathor dand kaa vidhaan to miltaa he tathaapi use sabhi aparaadhon main avadhya kaha gaya he
 * Along with Varnashrama, Boudhayan has also thrown enough light on the rights and duties of the king
 raja ko praja se aay kaa chatha bhaag kar ke rup main lenaa chahie, jisase vah praja kii raksha kar sake
 * The best part is mentioned by Dushyant in Abhigyanasakuntalam as tax
 * Boudhayan has made a law to wear new clothes at the time of Yajna, along with the name has also said that Yajaman, Yajman wife and Ritwik should all wear pure clothes
 * is kathan se spasht he ki striyon ko bhi pati ke saath yajna main baithne kaa adhikaar tha
 * Boudhayan has prohibited the freedom of women * and has also quoted a verse in this subject, which is also available in the present Manusmriti * with the help of spelling words
 boudhayan dharmasutra ke anusaar, daybhag main bhi striyon kaa adhikaar nahin he
 * Boudhayan has also quoted a verse from the name of Kashyapa - the woman who is bought with the substance, gets the position of the maid, not the wife
 * is prakaar kul milakar is dharmasutra main stri kii sthiti acchhee nahin he
 Like women, the Shudras also do not have a very good status
 ek sthaan par utane samay tak anadhyaay karne kaa vidhaan kiya gaya he, jitne samay tak shudra dikhalaayi pade yaa uski dhwani sunaayi de
 * boudhayan dharmasutra ke pratham prashn ke pancham adhyay ke anek sutron main mansabhakshan kaa prasang bhi chalaaya gaya he
 All the scholars believe that there have been many changes and additions in this Dharmasutra from time to time, due to which it appears that this meat-case and the expositional episodes of the life of women and Shudras were also introduced in it
 is prakaar is dharmasutra main maanav jivan se sambandhit praayah sabhi karttavyon kaa vidhaan karke use prashast karne kaa ytn kiya gaya he
 The immediate circumstances must have had an effect on the sutrakara, the same reflection is seen in this dharmasutra
 is dharmasutra kaa pratipaadya manusmriti se paryaapt samya rakhata he
 The only explanation available is its Govindaswamy's description 'namni'
 is vyakhya main gownd swami ne anek smritiyon ke uddhran die hai
 Apart from this, he has also given many quotations from Shatatap, Shankhakhita, Mahabhashya, Yogasutra, Bhagavadgita and Shabarabhishya
 shrautasutron ke bhi paryaapt uddhran isamen praapt hote hai
 All of these can be gauged by the wisdom of Govind Swami

 The first attempt to give a mathematical formula about gravity was made by Isaac Newton, which was surprisingly correct
 unhone gurutvkarshan siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Newton's theory was later replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity
 isse purv varah mihir ne kaha tha ki kisi prakaar kii shakti hi vastuon ko pruthivi par chipkaae rakhti he
 Modern work on the theory of gravity began in the late 16th and early 17th century with the work of Galileo Galilei
 apane mashhoor prayogon main pisa ke tower se gendon ko chhodane kaa prayog kiya gaya, or baad main gendon ke saavdhaneepurvak maap ke saath incleain ko ghumaya gaya, galileo ne dikhaaya ki gurutvkarshan twaran sabhi vastuon ke liye samaan he
 This was a major departure from Aristotle's belief that heavier objects have higher gravitational acceleration
 galileo ne hawa ke pratirodh ko is kaaran ke rup main bataaya ki kam dravyaman vaali vasteen vaataavaran main dhimi gati se gir sakati hai
 Galileo's work set the stage for the creation of Newton's theory of gravity iske baad ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa sambandh hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutv niyatank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration
 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 german khagolvid kepler ne grahon kii gati kaa adhyayan karke teen niyam diye
 Kepler's first law: - All planets revolve around the Sun in elliptical orbits and the Sun is at the focus of those orbits
 dwitiya niyam - kisi bhi grah ko surya se milaane vaali rekha samaan samay me samaan kshetrafal paar karti he
 That is, the regional speed of each planet remains fixed
 arthath jab grah surya se dur hota he to uski chaal kam ho jaati he
 Third law: - The square of the Sun's rotation period of each planet is proportional to the third power of the semi-long axis of its long circular orbit
 gurutvkarshan: "pitaaji, yah prithvi, jis par ham nivas karte hai, kis par tiki hui he?" leelavati ne shatabdiyon purv yah prashn apane pita bhaskaracharya se poocha tha
 In response, Bhaskaracharya said, "bale Leelavati !, some people who say that this earth is based on Sheshnag, Tortoise or Elephant or any other thing, then they are wrong
 yadi yah maan bhi liya jaae ki yah kisi vastu par tiki hui he to bhi prashn bana rahata he ki vah vastu kis par tiki hui he or is prakaar kaaran kaa kaaran or phir uskaa kaaran


 yah kram chalata rahaa, to nyaay shaastra main ise anavastha dosha kehete hai
 Lilavati said, yet the question remains, what is the earth resting on? tab bhaskaracharya ne kaha, kyon ham yah nahin maan sakate ki prithvi kisi bhi vastu par aadhaarit nahin he
 xxrep 5 
 If we say that the earth rests on its own force and call it gravitational force, then what is the fault? is par leelavati ne poocha yah kaise sambhav he
 Then Bhaskaracharya says about the theory that the power of things is very strange
 aage kehete hai- That is, there is attraction power in the earth
 prithvi apni aakarshan shakti se baari padaarthon ko apni ore khinchati he or aakarshan ke kaaran vah jameen par girte hai
 But when the same strength came from all around in the sky, how did anyone fall? That is, the planets in the sky remain motionless because the gravitational powers of various planets keep balance

 pratham angl-afakhaan yuddh jise pratham afakhaan yuddh ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he, 1839 se 1842 ke bich afghanistan main angrejon or afghanistan ke sainikon ke bich ladaa gaya tha
 The main reason for this was the fear of the British policy of expanding the Russian Empire
 aarambhik jeet ke baad angrezo ko baari kshati hui, baad main saamagree or sainikon ke pravesh ke baad ve jeet to gaye par tik nahin sake
 The increasing presence of the Russians in Afghanistan was causing the concern of the British, as they were secretly ruling its neighboring country in many parts
 angrezo ne alexander burns naamak ek jasoos ko afghanistan kii sthiti or vahaan ke sainya soochnaaon ko ikaitha karne san 1831 main kabul bheja
 Burns collected many important geographical and strategic information over the course of a year and his book became famous
 apane kabul pravaas ke dauraan usne vahaan roosi guptcharon ke bare main bhi zikr kiya jisase british shashan ko ek nai jaankaree mili
 He was awarded the awards
 pashchimi afghanistan main hue ek irani akraman main heraat irani samrajya kaa fir se hissaa ban gaya or purv main peshawar par ranjit singh ke sikh samrajya kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 In this situation, Afghan rich friend Muhammad Khan sought help from the British Empire, but he did not help
 iske baad roosi guptcharon or duuton ke kabul main hone se angrezon ko dar ho gaya ki kahin roosi madhya asia ke raste afghanistan main daakhil ho gaye to unke bhartiya samrajya banane ke sapane main roosi akraman kaa dar shaamil ho jayega
 Because of this, they invaded Afghanistan
 angrezon ne 1839 main dakshin main queta se afghanistan main pravesh kiya
 Initially, the British took over cities like Kandhar, Ghazni and Kabul
 vahaan par angrezon ne afagaan gaddi ke purv daavedaar shah shuja ko amir ghoshit kar diya jo ab tak kashmir or punjab main chhupataa rahaa tha
 But it did not remain popular and the Afghan people looked like a foreign puppet
 1841 main afgaani logo ne kabul main angrejo ke khilaaf vidroh kar diya
 They surrounded the fort by killing the British soldiers
 1842 ke shuruyaat main angrejo ne aatm-samarpan kar diya
 In 1842, he was given a safe exit
 lekin jalalabad ke angrezi thikaane par pahunchne se pehle afakhaan akraman se lagbhag sabhi log mar gaye or ek vyakti waapas pahunch sakaa
 This incident created fear in the British Army
 1842 main british dubaara afghanistan main daakhil hue lekin apni jeet sunishchit karne ke baad laut gaye

 a carpet or rug is a heavy laying on whose upper surface, usually small but very dense fibers of wool stand

 Silk is also used occasionally instead of wool, but such carpets are very expensive and less durable
 kapaas ke soot ke bhi kaaleen banate hai, kintu unka utana aadar nahin hota
 Yarn and jute are used for carpet backs
 oon ke tantu main lachak kaa amuly gun hone se yah tantu kalinon ke mukhaprishth ke liye vishesh upyogi hota he
 As a result, even after wearing a shoe, it remains on the carpet for a long time
 taane ke liye kapaas kii door kaa hi upyog kiya jaataa he, parantu bane ke liye soot athwa patson kaa
 The use of jute makes the carpet heavy and stiff, which is its essential and admirable quality
 achche kalinon main soot kii door ke saath patson kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Wool is dyed before weaving the carpet
 iske liye oon kii lachchhiyon ko baans ke dandon main latakaakar oon ko rang ke garam ghol main daal diya jaataa he or rang chadh jane par unhen nikaal liya jaataa he
 Modern dyeing is done by machine
 kuch mashiinon main rangaai praaia: haath kii rangaai ke samaan hi hoti he, kintu rang ke ghol ko pani kii bhaap dwaara garam kiya jaataa he or lachchhiyaan mashin ke chalane se chakkar katati jaati hai
 In other machines, wool yarn is stuck in large quantities and the hot colored solution is periodically pumped in opposite directions
 aisi mashine haal main hi chali hai
 The dyeing of wool yarn used in carpet is satisfactory only when the color penetrates an equal amount within each fiber
 iskaa anumaan tantu ke bahari rang se sadaiv nahin ho paata or acchhee rangaai ke liye kuch dhaagon kii gucchhi katkar dekh lee jaati he
 Satisfactory dyeing is as essential for good carpet as weaving of concrete and concrete

 Hand weaving is usually done the same way throughout the world
 taane urdhwadhar disha main tane rahete hai
 Above they are wrapped on a cylinder which can rotate
 neeche ve ek anya belan par bandhe rahete hai
 As the carpet gets ready, it is wrapped on the bottom cylinder, as in the weaving of ordinary cloth
 taane ke aadhe taar aage peeche hataae ja sakate hai or unke bich bana daalaa jaataa he
 In this way, the carpet weaving is done on the same principle as that of cloth, but once the weft is inserted, a piece of wool is tied on the strands of the warp
 tukdaa katkar bandhna or lambey dhaage kaa ek sira baandhakar kaatna, donon prathaen prachlit hai
 The tied piece is about two inches long and is stuck in a side by side strand

 Then the yarn snares are tied and weft strings are inserted
 prayek baar bane ke taar pad jane ke baad lohe ke panje se thokkar unako baitha diya jaataa he, jisase kaaleen kii bunai gaf ho
 There may be a slight change in the method of putting the weft, which causes some change in the properties of the carpet
 aajkal saadhaarant: kaaleen bahut chaude bune jate hai
 Therefore, while weaving them, many artisans sit in front of the stalls and each one sets a wool loop about two feet in width
 karigar apane saamne aalekhan rakhe rahete hai or usee ke anusaar rangon kaa chunaav karte hai
 It is clear from the way of the trap that wool flakes do not rise from the surface of the carpet at right angles, some slopes remain
 haath ke bune kalinon kaa yah vishesh lakshan he After the carpet is woven, the ends of the wool bunches are cut with scissors to make the height of the wool equal

 There are usually 20-25 flakes
 bharat, iran, misr, turki or china haath ke bane kalinon ke liye prasiddh hai
 Places like Mirzapur, Bhadohi, Kashmir, Masulipatam etc
 are famous for carpets in India and only Persian knot is used in all these carpets
 mashin kii bunai kai prakaar kii hoti he
 The oldest is the Brussels Carpet
 isamen kaaleen ke prishth par oon ke dhaagon kaa kataa sira nahin rahata, doharaa hua dhaagaa rahata he
 The texture is such that if the wool is strong enough, pulling one end will pull all the wool in a row into an entire piece

 Only threads of the same color are made which appear on the surface of the carpet
 in kaarnon se paanch se adhik rangon kaa upyog ek hi kaaleen main kathin ho jaataa he
 Frequent perforated plies are used to pour the same type of balloons, such as when making balloons in a cotton cloth
 oon kaa sira kataa na rahane ke kaaran ye kaaleen bahut achche nahin lagate
 Most of the woolen yarn is buried between the weaves
 is prakaar bhaar badhaane ke atirikt vah kisi kaam nahin aata or kaaleen kaa mulya bekaar bad jaataa he
 The circulation of these carpets has reduced very much now
 wilton kaaleen kii praarambhik bunaavat waisi hi hoti he jaisi brusselles kaaleen kii, parantu bunate samay oon ke fandon ke bich dhaatu kaa taar daal diya jaataa he jiskaa sira chipta or dhardaar hota he
 When this wire is pulled, the snares of wool are cut and the surface becomes as velvety as a hand-woven carpet
 makhmali prishth dekhne main sundar or sparsh karne main bahut komal hota he
 The machine itself keeps on pulling the wire
 wilton kaaleen main oonee makhmali prishth ke guchchhe brusselles kaaleen ke dohare dhaage kii apeksha adhik dridhtaa se bunai main phase rahete hai
 These carpets are often woven thicker than Brussels and do not attempt to lift weights
 komalta or kaarigari ke kaaran mulya adhik hone par bhi ye kaaleen pasand kiye jate hai
 Due to high consumption of cheap carpets, cheap woolen wilts started being made, which used cheap woolen yarn
 ekarange wilton sabase saste padate hai or un logon ko, jo ekaranga kaaleen pasand karte hai, ye kaaleen bahut achche lagate hai
 There is inconvenience in making the wide Wilton carpet
 isliye fande banane or unako kaatane main dhaatu ke taar kii jagah dhaatu ke ankushon kaa upyog hone laga he
 Although these carpets are the latest in machine-made carpets, they are very close to the inland carpets in texture
 samanta is baat main he ki ye oon ke dhaagon ke gucchhon se bane hote hai, yadhyapi guchchhe mashin dwaara daale jate hai or unamem gaanthen nahin padi rahati
 The specialty of Exminster carpet is that the flakes are inserted in vertical rows between the stems
 ye daalane se pehle yaa baad main kaate jate hai or bane se bunaavat main kase rahete hai
 Each bunch appears on the surface of the carpet and is part of the plot
 gucchhon kaa koi bhi bhaag brusselles or wilton kalinon kii tarah chipa nahin rahata or is prakaar vyarth nahin jaataa
 At least part of the loop is suppressed by weft

 The texture of this carpet costs less and the accessories are also less
 bunaavat vishesh saghan sundar jaan padati he or aise kalinon ke banane main asankhya aalekhnon or rangon ke samavesh kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Like other carpets, they also have many combinations, but the texture is not distinct
 bhed keval gucchhon ke tantuon kii achchhai, saghanta or unako phasaane kii vidhi main hota he
 The texture of Exminster carpets is shown in Figure 8
 alag-alag companiyon ke kalinon main thodaa bahut bhed hote hue bhi saadharantaya dohare linen kaa yaa sooti taana, sooti bharaaoo bana or patson kaa doharaa bana prayukt kiya jaataa he
 Earlier machine-made carpets were not very wide
 chaude kalinon ke liye do yaa adhik pattiyon ko jodna padataa tha, kintu ab bahut chaude kaaleen bhi mashin par bune ja sakate hai
 Often all ancient writing can be copied and thus from time to time one, sometimes the other drafting comes in fashion
 iske atirikt kaaleen banane kii mashin, kaaleen kii banaavat or dhaagon ko rangne kii vidhi main dinondin unnati ho rahi he
 This is the goal of preparing more and more goods in the stipulated time and with minimum labor

 Currently, these carpets are sold in large quantities in the US market
 gucchhit kalinon kii mashiinon kii maal taiyaar karne kii kshamta bahut adhik hoti he or mashin lagane kaa praarambhik kharch adhik hote hue bhi saste kaaleen taiyaar hote hai
 The face and back of these carpets are not made together
 mukhaprishth ke fande yaa to silaai dwaara pehle se bani hui peeth par taak die jate hai yaa guchchhe rasinic lep dwaara peeth ke kapade par chipka die jate hai
 In the second method, after some heating process, the adhesive becomes firm and the flakes are firmly attached to the back
 oon ke fandon ke donon ore ek-ek peeth chipkaakar or fandon ko bichobich katkar ek hi samay main do kaaleen bhi taiyaar kiye ja sakate hai
 There is a lot of progress in tufted carpets in all directions even after the carpet is made, or after the carpet is painted, or the printing is done
 upar kai virgo ke kalinon kaa varnan kiya gaya he
 If there is any single word about the carpet of any class, which leads to the knowledge of its entire quality, defect, category and value, then it is the quality of the carpet
 quality pradhanat: kaaleen ke mukhaprishth par oonee gucchhon ke ghaneypan par nirbhar rahati he
 Thus high quality, middle quality, low quality are common terms in the carpet trade
 ghaney bune hue kaaleen ke liye saadharantaya badhiya or lambii oon kaa patala dhaag aavashyak hota he
 a high-grade warp is required with the addition of a large quantity of precious wool
 badhiya patale dhaage ke upyog or gaanthon ke paas-paas hone se kaaleen taiyaar hone main samay adhik lagata he
 Thus, high quality carpet is worth more
 kaaleen kii quality ek varg inch main gaanthon kii sankhya se pradarshit kii jaati he
 However, this practice is not satisfactory until it is also decided whether the knots are inserted with a single thread or by a double or triple thread
 udhaahrant:, tihare dhaage se bana kaaleen dohare dhaage se bane kaaleen kii apeksha, prati varg inch kam gaanthon kaa hone par bhi, ghanaa ho saktaa he

 Chess is played on a chess board, which is a square board divided into 64 squares of alternating colors, similar to the board used in the game of drafts
 bisaat ke vaastavik rang chaahe koi bhi hon, halke rang vaale varg ‘lite’ athwa ‘safed’ tathaa gahare rang vaale varg ‘dark’ athwa ‘kaale’ kehalaate hai

 At the beginning of the game, the pieces are arranged according to the image shown on the right
 khilaadi kii ore se duusari pankti main 8 pyaade hote hai; khilaadi kii nikatatam pankti main baaki mohare hote hai
 Popular phrases to remember the arrangement of pieces that are often used by new players are "queen on On Color" and "white on Right"
 The latter phrase deals with laying the board according to which the nearest right square of each player should be white
 bisaat kaa prayek varg ek akshar or ek sankhya ke ek vishisht yugma dwaara pahachaanaa jaataa he
 The vertical lines are indicated by letters from a to h to the right of White to the left of White
 isi prakaar kshaitij panktiyon ko bisaat ke nikatatam safed hisse se shuru kar 1 se lekar 8 kii sankhya se nirupit karte hai
 After this, each square of the board is uniquely identified by its file letter and rank number
 safed badshaah, udhaaharan ke liye, khel kii shuruyaat main i1 varg main rahegaa
 bi8 varg main sthit kaala ghoda pehali chaal main e6 athwa si6 par pahonchega
 Each player has one of two sets of colored pieces under their control and is named after the player's respective pieces of color, ie white or black
 White pieces are the first to turn, and as in most chess games, one player moves after another
 chaal chalanaa anivaary hota he; chaal chalane se bachanaa yani "paas" hona vaid nahin hota he- yahaan tak ki tab bhi jab chaal chalanaa khilaadi ke liye khatarnaak he

 Each piece of chess has a different way of moving
 virdohi ke mohare ko kaatane kii sthiti ko chhodkar chaalen hameshaa kisi na kisi rikt varg main hi chali jaati hai
 Pieces cannot pass over each other except with the exception of the horse
 When a piece is cut, the attacking piece is established in that section of the enemy's piece
 The cut pieces are thus removed from the game and cannot be returned during the rest of the game
 The emperor can be instigated but he cannot be cut
 caseling ke antargat badshaah ko kishti kii ore do varg badhaakar or kishti ko badshaah ke duusari ore uske thik bagal main rakhkar kiya jaataa he
 Castling can only be done when the following conditions are met: yadi khilaadi e kaa pyaadaa do varg aage badhata he or khilaadi bi kaa pyaadaa sambandhit khadi pankti main 5veen kshaitij pankti main he to bi kaa pyaadaa e ke pyaade ko, uske keval ek varg chalane par kaat saktaa he
 This cutting can only be done in the gait immediately after it
 is udhaaharan main yadi safed pyaadaa e2 se e4 tak aata he, to bi4 par sthit kaala pyaadaa ise anpaisan vidhi se kaat kar e3 par pahonchega
 If the pawn reaches your 8th horizontal line, then it can progress and become a wazir / queen, rook, fish or horse of its own color, depending on what the player wants to make
 This selection is not limited to earlier cut pieces
 at: saidhantik rup se yah sambhav he ki khilaadi nau kii sankhya tak vazeer athwa das kii sankhya tak kishti, feel athwa ghode bana le,yadi uske sabhi pyaadon kii tarakkee ho jaae to
 yadi khilaadi kii pasand kaa mohara uplabdh nahin he to khilaadi ko nirnaayak se us mohare ko uplabdh karaane ke liye kahana chahie
 When a player makes a move that threatens to cut the opponent's king, the king is considered to be in check
 shah kii paribhaasha yah he ki ek yaa adhik virdohi mohare saidhantik rup se agali chaal main badshaah ko kaat denge 
 yadi kisi khilaadi kaa badshaah shah kii sthiti main he to khilaadi ko aisi chaal chalani padegi jo badshaah katane ke khatre ko khatm kar de; khilaadi kabhi bhi apane badshaah ko apni chaal ke ant main shah kii sthiti main nahin chhod saktaa
 shah ko khatm karne ke sambhavit tareeke is prakaar hai: In informal games, it is necessary to declare check when a move is done to check the opponent's king
 yadhyapi aupchaarik pratiyogitaaon main shaayad hi kabhi shah kii ghoshnaa kii jaati ho
 The player may not make any move that would put his king in check or leave the king already in the position of check, even in situations where the cheering piece is not moved by the pin Can go, that is, when the pawn moves on the opponent's own king
 iskaa yah bhi arth he ki khilaadi apane badshaah ko virdohi ke badshaah ke thik bagal vaale kisi bhi varg main nahin rakh saktaa kyonki aisa karne se virdohi badshaah dwaara uske badshaah par shah pad jayega
 If a player is instigated by a king and there is no valid move that allows the player to save his king from check, the king is considered to be in the position of checkmate, the game is over and that player loses
 kyonki shah or maat se khel kaa ant hota he, isliye duusare moharon ke vipareet, badshaah vastav main na to kabhi katataa he or na hi bisaat se hataaya ja saktaa he
 The figure on the right shows a sample of the position of checkmate and checkmate
 safed badshaah ko kaale vazeer / rani se khatra he; prayek varg, jisamen badshaah ja saktaa he, par bhi khatra he; badshaah vazeer / rani ko kaat nahin saktaa kyonki tab isapar kishti kaa khatra utpann ho jaataa he
 Any player can accept defeat at any time before the position of checkmate and then his opponent will win
 This usually happens when the player is confident that he is going to lose the game
 khilaadi bolkar haar maan saktaa he athwa apane scoreshit par teen tareeke se likhakar aisa kar saktaa he: "resigns" likhakar, khel ke parinaam ko gol gherkar, athwa yadi kaale mohare vaale paksh ne haar maani he to "1–0" likhakar or yadi safed paksh ne haar maani he to "0–1" likhakar
 apane badshaah ko gira dena bhi haar maan lene kaa sanket he kintu iskaa adhik prayog nahin hota 
 donon ghadiyon ko roak diya janaa haar maan lene kii nishaani nahin he, kyonki nirnaayak ko bulaane ke liye bhi ghadiyaan roki ja saktaa hai
 The proposal to join hands is also not necessarily considered defeat, as it can be thought that the players have agreed to draw
 khel drow kii sthiti main khatm ho jayega yadi inamen se koi paristhiti utpann ho jaae
 a player who has to make a move can claim a draw by announcing that one of the following situations has occurred, or with a declaration of intent to make a move that produces one of the following situations: yadi daawa sahi paaya jaae to khel drow ho jaataa he
 Once there was such a rule that if it is possible for a player to constantly check the rival king and the player has expressed his intention to continue doing so, then the game will be drawn
 This rule is no longer in effect; However, players will often agree to a draw in such a situation, because in such a situation the rule of repeating thrice or the rule of 50 moves will eventually apply
 l us khilaadi kii haar ke saath khatm hoga jisane apana sampurna aavantit samay khatm kar liya ho 
 samay niyantran vibhinn prakaar ke hote hai
 The player may be given a fixed period of time for the entire game, or have to make a certain number of moves within a certain time
 saath hi prayek chaal ke liye samay main ek choti-si vruddhi kii ja sakati he
 These rules apply to games of chess that are played "over the board"
 patrachaar shatranj, blitz shatranj, computer shatranj tathaa shaareerik aakshamata vaale khilaadiyon ke khilne ke liye khaas niyam hote hai
 The pieces should be carried with one hand
 ek baar mohare chalakar haath hataa lene ke baad, yadi chaal avaidh na ho to use waapas nahin kiya ja saktaa
 jab caseling kiya jaae, khilaadi ko ek haath se pehle badshaah ko chalanaa chahie or tab usee haath se kishti chalanaa chahie
 In the event of a pawn promotion, if the player frees the pawn in the 8th horizontal line, the player must progress the pawn
 pyaade ko chal lene ke baad, khilaade ko bisaat par rakhe kisi bhi mohare ko nahin choona he or tarakkee kii prakriya tab tak sampann nahin hogi jab tak ki tarakkee vaale varg main nayaa mohara na aa jaae
 In serious games, if a player touches one of his pawns in such a way that it is as if that pawn has to be played, the player must make a valid move
 jab tak haath ko nae varg main mohare par se na hataa liya jaae tab tak us mohare ko kisi bhi vaid varg main rakhaa ja saktaa he
 If a player touches an opponent's piece, he must cut that piece, if he can cut it
 yadi chhue gaye moharon main se koi bhi mohara chalane ke liye vaid na ho to koi panelti nahin hogi, kintu yah niyam ab bhi khilaadi ke apane moharon par lagu hoga
 The first pawn to be touched during castling would be the emperor
 yadi khilaadi ek hi samay main badshaah ke saath kishti ko bhi chhu detaa he, to khilaadi ko, yadi aisa karnaa vaid ho, to us kishti ke saath hi kaisal karnaa padegaa
 yadi khilaadi bina kishti ko chhue badshaah ko do varg khiskaa letaa he, to khilaadi ko tadnusaar sahi kishti jarur chalani chahie yadi us disha main caseling karnaa vaid ho
 If the player tries to do castling illegally, the king's second legitimate move, including castling, must be done if possible
 jab pyaade ko uski 8veen kshaitij pankti main chalaa jaataa he, tab pyaade par se khilaadi dwaara ek baar haath hataa lene par phir pyaade ke liye koi anya chaal nahin chali ja sakegi
 haalanki, chaal tab tak puri nahin hogi jab tak tarakkee praapt mohara us varg main na rakh diya jaae
 If a player touches a piece with the intention of correcting its position on the board, then that player must inform his opponent about his intention by saying "j'adoube" or "I adjust"
 Once the game starts, only the player who has the turn to touch the piece on the board
 toornament ke khel samay seemaa ke andar, jise samay niyantran kehete hai, khel ghadi ke saath khele jate hai
 Each player must make his move within the time control otherwise he will lose the game
 There are different types of time controls
 kuch sthitiyon main prayek khilaadi ke paas ek nishchit sankhya main chaal chalane ke liye ek nishchit samyavadhi hoti he
 In other situations each player has a certain amount of time to play all his moves
 iske alaava, khilaadi ko uske prayek chaal ke liye, prayek chali gai chaal kaa samay badhaakar athwa har baar virdohi ke chal lene ke baad ghadi kii raftaar ko jaraa sa kam kar, thodi maatra main atirikt samay diya ja saktaa he
 If a player believes that his opponent is trying to win the game in time and not by normal measures, if it is a sudden death time control and the player has less than two minutes left, then the player watches Withholding can be sought to draw from the decider
 nirnaayak khel ko drow ghoshit kar saktaa he, athwa nirnay ko sthagit kar virdohi ke liye do minute kaa atirikt samay aavantit kar saktaa he 
 In a formal competition, each player is obliged to record each move by chess insignia in order to dispute disputes about illegal situations, time-control violations and the demand for a game draw by a 50-move rule or by repeating the situation
 To be resolved
 aajkal khelon ke vivaran rakhane ke liye shatranj ke bijaganitiya ankanpaddati ko maanak ke taur par sweekaar kiya gaya
 There are other methods such as ICCF numeric notation for international correspondence chess and the old descriptive chess notation
 The current rule is that any move on the board must be done before it can be recorded in writing on paper or recorded by an electronic device
 donon khilaadiyon ko apane scoreshit par chaal ke samay "=" likhakar drow ke prastaav kaa sanket dena chahie
 Clocks can be marked about time

 The player can respond to his opponent's move before the details are written
 jo khilaadi koi avaidh chaal chalata he use us chaal ko waapas lekar vaid chaal chalane chahie
 If possible, the move should be done with the same piece because, here, the touch-speed rule applies
 yadi avaidh chaal caseling ke dauraan chali gai ho to sparsh-chaal niyam badshaah par lagu hota he, kishti par nahin
 The adjudicator should adjust the time in the clock according to the best signal
 yadi galati par baad main jaakar hi dhyaan diya gaya ho, to khel us sthiti se pun: aarambh kiya janaa chahie jahaan galati hui thi
 Some regional organizations have different rules

 The player can correct illegal moves if he has not pressed his watch
 yadi khilaadi ne apni ghadi dabaa di ho to virdohi khilaadi apni chaal chalane se pehle jeet kaa daawa pesh kar saktaa he

 If during the game it is found that the starting position of the game was wrong, the game is restarted

 If the game is started with pieces of opposite color, the game continues
 Some regional organizations have different rules
 yadi kisi khilaadi se mohare ludhak jate hai, to apni chaal ke samay unhen unki sahi sthiti main pun: vyavasthit karnaa us khilaadi ke jimmedaari he
 If it is discovered that an illegal move has been made, or the pieces have been displaced, the game is restarted from a pre-emptive situation
 yadi us sthiti kaa nirdhaaran sambhav nahin he, to khel ko antim gyaat sahi sthiti se dubaara shuru kiya jaataa he

 Modern rules were first made in Italy during the 16th century
 badshaah, kishti tathaa ghode kii chaalen nahin badali hai
 The pawns did not originally have the option of walking two squares in the first move, nor did they progress when they reached their 8th horizontal row
 vazeer / rani mul rup se fars athwa virgin tha jo tirchhe rup se kisi bhi disha main ek varg chal saktaa tha, athwa pehali chaal main kshaitij rup se saamne kii ore athwa daaen-baayen do varg kii chalaang laga saktaa tha

 ‘two aspects of a printing’


 are ‘originality in its effectiveness’



 kyonki "supaathya" kaa aam arth "pathneey" hi he phir bhi kuch log hai, jinamein se kuch vyavsaayik rup se typography se jude log bhi hai, jo yah sochate hai ki "supaathyata " ek aisa shabd he jisapar tip kii prabhaavashiltaa ko lekar or bahes kii jarurat he
 But clarity and readability vary, although they are related to the type aspect
 sahi tareeke se janaa hua he ki ye do shabd tip kii visheshta or kaary ke vishleshan ko akele supaathyata shabd kii tulana main bahut hi sankshipt bhang se samajhane main madad kar sakate hai
 


 in typography we need to give a definition of legibility 


 to understand the meaning of clarity and the quality of being easily identifiable - so, for example, we can say that the lower size of the old italic style is lower
 Case h is not clear because its folded leg looks like b; Or a number 3 in a classified ad is very similar to an 8
 


 disple aakaaron main suvachyata ke maamle gambhir hote hai, ek varna jo 8 point par anischitata kaa kaaran hota he vahi 24 point par spasht ho jayega
 It is worth noting that the above principle applies to people with 20 / 20 vision at the appropriate reading distance in the required light
 arth kii swatantraaa or drishy kii tikshnata kii pariksha ke liye ek opticiuns chart kii samanta, spashtataa kii avadharana kii gunjaaish kaa sanket karne ke liye upyogi he
 'in typography 


 if the columns of a newspaper or magazine or the pages of a book can be read for many minutes without stress or difficulty, then we can say that the readability of the type is good
 is baat se drishy aaraam kii gunvattta kaa sanket miltaa he - paath kii lambii vistrut samaj main yah ek mahatvapurn aavashyaktaa he, lekin iske vipareet, telephone nirdeshika yaa hawaii jahaaj kii samay sarini jaisi chizon ke liye yah utana mahatvapurn nahin he, jahaan pathak ise lagaataar padhate nahin hai balki ek choti cheez kii soochna ko dhundte hai
 The difference in both aspects of visual effects is made by a familiar argument of sans-serif's suitability for text setting
 ek vishisht sans-cerife phase ke varna aapas main purna rup se samaj main aa sakate hai, lekin ek prasiddh upanyaas ko koi bhi isamen set karne ke bare main nahin soch saktaa kyonki isaki pathneeyata kam he
 Readability 'relates to direct knowledge' and readability 'refers to understanding'
 Typographers aim to excel in both
 "chunaa hua tiphphes spasht hona chahie
 matlab, yah prayaas ke bina padhaa janaa chahie
 kabhi kabhi spashtataa mahaj tip ke aakaar kaa maamla he
 But very often, this is a case of typeface design
 saamanyat: jo tiperphes buniyadi letterfarm ke najadik hote hai, ve un tiperpheson ke mukaable adhik spasht hote hai jo saghan, faile hue, sanware hue yaa alag hote hai
 However, a clear typeface can also be unreadable due to weak settings and sequence space, just as clear typefaces can be made more readable by good design
 spashtataa or pathneeyata donon ke adhyayan ne tip ke aakaar or dizin sahit anya tatwon ke ek bade range kii jaanch kii he

 udhaaharan ke liye, elex pool ke anusaar kisi ne bhi iskaa antim uttar nahin diya he ki koun phant, ceriphd yaa sans cerriff sabase adhik spashtataa pradaan karata he
 Other topics such as justified vs unzestified, use of hyphen, fonts suitable for people with difficulty reading, such as dyslexia, continue to be debated

 Clarity is usually measured through reading speed and with a level of comprehension to check effectiveness
 udhaaharan ke liye, miles tinkar, jisane, 1930 se 1960 ke dashak main kai adhyayanon ko prakashit karaayaa, tej gati se padhane ke pareekshan kaa upyog kiya jisamen aise pratibhaagiyon kii jarurat thi jo prabhaavashiltaa ke filter ke rup main betuke shabdon kaa upyog na karen
 The printability of the Royal College of Art's readability under the supervision of Professor Herbert Spencer, along with Brian Coe and Linda Reynolds, did important work in this area and was one of many centers that highlighted the importance of eye saccadic rhythms for readability - one Ability to take three words in a bar and physiognomy of the eye which means eye fatigue, if more than 3 or 4 second jump is required in the line

 These days, clarity-related research has been confined to difficult issues, or limited to testing specific design solutions
 Examples of difficult issues may include typefaces for people with visual impairments and typefaces for highway signs or other situations where clarity can make a significant difference
 suvachyata anusandhan sahitya kaa bahut kuch etheoratical he - vibhinn karkon kaa vyaktigat yaa samooh main pareekshan kiya gaya, lekin kai pareekshan padhane ke model yaa drishy dharna ke abhaav main kiye gaye
 Some typographers believe that overall word size) is very important for readability and that the theory of parallel letterwise identification is either inaccurate, less important, or does not include everything
