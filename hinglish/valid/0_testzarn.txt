 Advertising is a condition of having some special attraction different from the normal
 jis utpaada athwa vastu ko vigyaapit kiya ja rahaa he uski mukhya visheshta vigyaapan main honi chahie jisase logon main uske prati dharna sthapit karane main rukaawat na paidaa ho
 Advertising can be made more rational and effective by basing the main points or central point
 vigyaapan banane vaali agency ko chahie ki vah aisa vigyaapan taiyaar kare jo padhe-likhe tathaa anpadh, shahari tathaa gaanv, sabhi ke liye subodh ho
 The viewer will not be able to feel connected to the advertisement which will have to be brainwashed
 aisi sthiti main jab log use samaj hi nahin paayenge, utpaada ko upyog main laane kii ore kadam kaise badhaaege? The advertiser must present all the facts related to the product he wants to advertise

 Bruno endured the harsh tortures of the church throughout his life
 unhone apane jeevankaal ke lagbhag 8 varsh jail main bitaye magar unhone kabhi himmat nahin haare
 Seeing them not losing, on February 17, 1600 AD, the contractors of religion openly tied Bruno with a pillar at the crossroads in Rome and sprinkled kerosene on them
 bruno ne hanste hue aag main jalanaa sweekaar kiya
 But he stood by his facts and conclusions

 He was confident that one day he would come when the whole world would accept his discovery as true

 This fact was not understood by Bruno during his lifetime and he was strongly opposed
 lekin unki nirmam hatya ke baad yah sabit ho gaya ki surya bhi apane aksh par ghumta he
 Nearly 200 years after Bruno's death, Uranus, the 7th planet of our solar system, was discovered

 Template: Evolution3 The study of pairwise-variant frequency distributions and changes in the effects of four main evolutionary processes: natural selection, genetic predisposition, mutation and gene-flow is called population genetics

 jansankhya anuvanshiki jansankhyaon kii genetic banaavat par tathaa is baat ke adhyayan par dhyaan kendrit karti he ki yah banaavat samay ke saath kis prakaar badalati he
 a population is a set of organisms, in which any group of members can breed among themselves
 isamen yah antarnihit he ki sabhi sadsy ek hi prajati ke hote hai tathaa ek duusare ke aas-paas hi nivas karte hai
 For example, all moths of the same species living in a forest are a population
 is jansankhya main upasthit kisi jin ke vibhinn vaikalpik rup ho sakate hai, jo jeevon ke phenotip ke bich vividhtaon ko spasht karata he
 An example of this may be a gene responsible for the determination of color in kites, which consists of two alleles: black and white
 The entire set of pair choices for a gene in a single population is called a gene pool; The allele frequency for a pair option is the portion of the genes in that pool that consists of that pair option
 Development occurs when there is a change in the frequencies of pair choices within a population of hybrid organisms; For example, in a population of kites, the allele responsible for black color is becoming more common
 kisi jansankhya ke vikaas kaa kaaran banane vaali kaarividhi ko samajhane ke liye, is baat par vichaar karnaa upyogi he ki kisi jansankhya kaa vikaas na hone ke liye kin sthitiyon kaa hona aavashyak he
 According to the Hardy – Weinberg theory, the frequency of pair-choices in a sufficiently large population will remain constant if random swapping of pair-choices during erection of semen or eggs, and those pair-cells in these sex cells during fertilization
 Random combination of substitutes is the only power acting on that population
 aisi jansankhya ko hardi-vinberg samatulyata main mana jaataa he kyonki iskaa vikaas nahin ho rahaa he
 According to the Hardy – Weinberg theory, both allele and genotype frequencies in a population remain constant from generation to generation — that is, they are in a state of equilibrium — as long as there are specific effects that cause interference
 Do not come
 Outside the laboratory, one or more of these "disturbing effects" are always effective
 hardi vinberg samatulyata prakruti main asambhav hoti he
 Genetic equivalence is the ideal state to provide a baseline on which genetic change can be measured
 kisi jansankhya main yugma-vikalpiyon kii aavritiyaan pidiyon tak sthir baniin rahati hai, yadi nimnlikhit sharton kaa paalan kiya ja rahaa ho: yadrichhik sahavaas, koi utparivartan na hona, koi pravasan yaa utpravas na hona, jansankhya kaa bahut bada aakaar or kisi bhi lakshan ke samarthan yaa virodh main koi chaynaatmak dabaav na hona
 In the simplest case of a single gene locus with two alleles: dominant alleles are denoted by a and ineffective alleles are denoted by a and their frequencies are represented by p and q; freq = p; freq = q; p + q = 1
 If the population is in equilibrium, then we get freq = p 2 for AA homozygos in the population, freq = q 2 for aa homozygos, and freq = 2pq for heterozygous
 in samikarnon ke aadhaar par ek jansankhya ke bare main upyogi, lekin maapne-main-kathin tathyon kaa nirdhaaran kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, a patient's progeny is the carrier of an ineffective mutation that causes cystic fibrosis in homozygous recessive children
 abhibhavak yah jaananaa chaahati hai ki unke poton dwaara vanshanukram se is beemaari ko grahan kiye jane kii kitni sambhaavna he
 To answer this question, the genetic counselor must be aware of the possibility that the child will cohabit with an carrier of ineffective mutation
 sambhav he ki yah tathy gyaat na ho, parantu beemaari kii aavriti gyaat ho
 We know that the disease is caused by homozygous recessive genotypes; Therefore, we can use the Hardy – Weinberg principle to go back from the origin of the disease to the frequency of heterozygous ineffective individuals
 saanchaa:genetic genealogy The mathematics of population genetics was originally developed as a part of modern evolutionary synthesis
 betty ke anusaar, yah aadhunik sanshleshan ke mul ko paribhaashit karata he
 According to Lewontin, the theoretical work of population genetics is a process of two gaps: a "genotypic interval" and a "phenotypic interval"
 The challenge to a complete theory of population genetics is to provide a set of rules that can predict a population with a genotype to be predetermined with the phenotype where it is selected, and another set of rules that match the resulting population
 Again with genotypes, where the next generation of genotypes can be predicted by Mendelian genetics and thus Cycle is completed

 eksdi T1 represents genetic and epigenetic regulations, aspects of functional biology, or evolution, that convert a genotype into a phenotype
 ham iskaa ullekh "genotip-phenotip maanchitr" ke rup main karenge
 t 2 is a conversion caused by natural selection, t 3 is epigenetic relationships, which predict genotypes based on the selected phenotype, and ultimately t 4 the laws of Mendelian genetics

 aisa maan lenaa ki ham ise samaj rahe hai, hamaari ruchi ke anek maamalon kaa vishleshan karne ke liye paryaapt he
 For example, if the phenotype is nearly one-to-one with the genotype or the time-measure is sufficiently brief, "stationary objects" can be accepted as they exist; However, in many cases it is also wrong to do so

 Natural genetic diversity within a population of organisms means that some organisms will survive more successfully than other organisms in the current environment
 This issue was developed by Charles Darwin in his ideas of gender selection that factors influencing reproductive success Are also important

 The concept of natural selection was originally developed in the absence of a valid theory of heredity; At the time of Darwin's writing, there was no information about modern genetics

 That is, the pairs of alleles present in subsequent generations in the population are a random sample of the pairwise alternatives present in their parents
 or is baat ke nirdhaaran main avasar kii bhoomika hoti he ki kya kisi vishisht jeev kaa astitv bachaa rahegaa or vah prajnan karegaa
 The allele frequency of a population is the fraction or percentage of its gene copies compared to the total number of gene alleles sharing a specific variant
 anuvaanshik jhukaav ek mahatvapurn vikasaatmak prakriya he, jiske parinamswaroop samay ke saath-saath yugma-vikalpi aavritiyon main parivartan hote hai
 Because of this, any variation of the gene can also be completely eliminated, which reduces genetic variability
 prakritik chayan, jo jin ke vividh roopon ko prajnan main unki safalataa ke aadhaar par adhik aam yaa kam aam banaata he, ke vipareet anuvaanshik jhukaav ke kaaran hone vaale parivartan vaataavaran ke yaa anukulan ke dabaavon dwaara sanchalit nahin hote or ve prajnan kii safalataa ke prati laabhadaayak, tatasth yaa hanikaarak bhi ho sakate hai
 The effect of genetic predation is large in small populations and small in large populations

 Ronald Fisher's view is that genetic predisposition plays a negligible role in development and this approach has been effective for many decades

 Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome and are caused by radiation, viruses, transposon, and mutant chemicals, as well as errors that occur during meiosis or DNA replication
 trutiyaan aksar diene pratilipikaran kii prakriya ke dauraan, duusare reshe ke bahulkikaran main, utpann hoti hai
 These errors can also be caused by the organism itself by cellular processes such as over-mutation
 utparivartan kisi jeev ke phenotip par prabhaav daal sakate hai, vishesh rup se yadi ve kisi jin ke protein koding kram ke bheetar utpann hote hai
 The rate of errors is generally very low due to the "proofreading" ability of DNA polymerase
 prufreeding ke bina, trutiyon kii daren isse hazaar guna adhik hoti hai
 Chemical damage in DNA also occurs naturally and cells use a DNA correction procedure to correct this breakage and mis-match in DNA
 iske baavjood, kabhi-kabhi yah sudhaar diene ko iske mul kram main waapas laane main vifal rahata he
 Mutations can also occur due to errors in alignment during meiosis, in organisms that use chromosomal changes to exchange DNA and recombine genes
 badlaav main hone vaali trutiyaan utpann hone kii sambhaavna tab hoti he, jab ek jaise kram apane sahabhaagi gun-sutron ko galat sanrekhan apnaane par baadhya karte hai; iske kaaran jinom ke kuch kshetra is prakaar hone vaale utparivartan ke prati adhik samvedansheel ban jate hai
 These errors produce large structural changes in the DNA sequence — the duplication, reversal or deletion of the entire region, or the erroneous interchange of entire parts between different properties
 utparivartan ke kaaran diene kram main vibhinn prakaar ke anek parivartan ho sakate hai; sambhav he ki inkaa koi prabhaav na ho, yaa ye ek jin ke utpaada ko parivartit kar den yaa ye jin ko kaary karne se roak den
 In a study on a fly called Drosophila melanogaster, it was found that if a mutation alters a protein produced by a gene, it will probably be harmful because the effect of about 70 percent of this mutation would be harmful and the rest would be either neutral
 Will be or will be very less profitable
 koshikaon par in utparivartanon ke sambhavit hanikaarak prabhaavon ke kaaran, jeevon ne utparivartanon ko dur karne ke liye diene sudhaar jaisi kaarividhiyaan viksit kar leen hai
 Therefore, the optimal rate of mutation between species is between the costs of high mutation rates, such as malignant mutations, and the metabolic costs of maintaining systems, such as DNA repair enzymes, to reduce mutation rates
 apane anuvaanshik padaarth ke rup main arene kaa prayog karne vaale vishaanuon main utparivartan kii daren teevr hoti hai, jisase laabh ho saktaa he kyonki ye vishaanu lagaataar tathaa teevr gati se viksit honge or is prakaar, udaahranarth maanviya pratiraksha tantra kii, rakshaatmak pratikriya se batch niklenge
 Mutations may involve duplication of large portions of DNA, most commonly through genetic recombination

 Another advantage of copying a gene is that it increases redundancy; This allows one gene of the pair to adopt a new function, while the other copy continues the original function
 utparivartan ke anya prakaar aksar purv main koding na kiye gayi diene se naye jin kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Gene flow is interchangeable between populations, which are often the same species

 Immigration can add new genetic material to a population's gene pool
 iske vipareet utpravas anuvaanshik padaarth ko hataa saktaa he
 Since the creation of new species of populations requires barriers to reproduction between two dispersed populations, gene flow can slow this process by spreading genetic differences between populations
 parvat-shrinkhalaaon, mahasaagaron or registaanon yaa yahaan tak ki maanav-nirmit sanrachanaon, jaise china kii vishaal diwaar, jisane vanaspati ke jeenon ke pravaah ko roak diya, jin pravaah main avrodh utpann karte hai
 Depending on how far the two species have drifted away from their most recent common ancestor, it may still be possible for them to produce their offspring, such as breeding mules from horses and donkeys
 aam taur par aise sankar jeev anupjau hote hai kyonki gun-sutron ke do bhinn samucchy miyosis ke dauraan jodiyaan bana paane main sakasham nahin hote

 The importance of hybridization in the creation of new species of animals is unclear, however, its cases have been seen in many types of animals, and the gray tree frog is a typical example of this, which has been very well studied
 tathaapi sankaran vanaspatiyon main prajatikaran kaa ek mahatvapurn madhyam he, kyonki pashuon kii tulana main vanaspatiyon dwaara poliploidi ko adhik sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 Polyploidy is important in hybridizations because it allows reproduction in which each of the two different sets of chromosomes is able to pair with a homologous partner during meiosis
 poliploid jeevon main adhik anuvaanshik vividhta bhi hoti he, jiske kaaran ve choti jansankhyaon main antah prajnan ke dabaav se bache rah sakate hai
 Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another that is not its progeny; It is most common in bacteria
 chikitsa ke kshetra main, yah antibiotic ke prati pratirodh ke vistaar main yogadan karata ham kyonki jab ek jeevanu pratirodhi jin praapt kar letaa he, to vah tezi se unhen duusari prajatiyon tak sthanantarit kar saktaa he
 Horizontal transfer of genes may also have occurred from bacteria to eukaryote organisms, such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Azuki bean bumblebee Callosobruchus chinensis
 bade paimaane par hue sthanantaranon kaa ek udhaaharan eukereotic deloid rotifer hai, jinhone shaayad jeevanuon, kavakon tathaa vanaspatiyon se jeenon kii ek shrinkhalaa praapt kii he
 Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, causing the transfer of genes between biological regions as well
 chloroplast va mitocondria ke adhigrahan ke dauraan eukeriotic koshikaon tathaa prokeriot jeevon ke bich bhi bade paimaane par jin sthanantaran ho saktaa he
 Gene flow is the transfer of alleles from one population to another
 kisi ek jansankhya ke bheetar yaa usase baahar pravaasana yugma-vikalpi aavritiyon main ek lakshaneey parivartan ke liye uttaradaayi ho saktaa he
 Immigration can also result in new genetic variants added to the established gene pool of a specific species or population
 vibhinn jansankhyaon ke bich jin pravaah kii dar ko prabhavit karne vaale anek kaarak hai
 One of the most important factors is mobility, because the higher the mobility of the organism, the higher its migration probability
 pashuon kii gatishiltaa vanaspatiyon se adhik hoti he, haalanki paraag-kan or bich pashuon yaa hawa ke dwaara bahut lambii duriyon tak le jaye ja sakate hai
 Maintained gene flow between two populations can also result in a combination of two gene pools, leading to a decrease in genetic diversity between the two groups
 yahi kaaran he ki in samoohon ke jin pulon kaa punarsangyojan karke or is prakaar anuvaanshik vividhta, jiske parinamswaroop purna prajatikaran tathaa maadaa prajatiyon kaa nirmaan hua hota, main antar viksit karke jin pravaah prajatikaran ke khilaaf dridhtaa se kaary karata he

 uske baad, aapako pataa he kya hua? belestrey ne yah aadesh diya ki ise badla nahin jayega

 You should fight for what you believe is right
