 However, such a formulation computing process is complex and this may require indicators of size that are exponentially twice as large
 is arth main regular oxpraishan suvyavasthit bhashaa ko suchit kar sakate hai, thik-thik bhashaa kii aisi shrenee jo niyamaatmak parimit autometa ke dwaara sweekrut he
 However, there is a notable difference in consistency
 suvyavasthit bhashaaon kii kuch shreniyon ko niyamaatmak parimit autometa dwaara varnit kiya ja saktaa he, jiskaa aakaar ghaataanki rup se sabase chote regular oxpraishan ke samakaksh bad jaataa he
 Languages are the standard example here
 Lk varna {{0}a,b } par jiskaa antim akshar k a kii barabari apane sabhi strings sahit karata he
 On the one hand, the regular expression describing l 4 is given by ∗ a { \ displaystyle ^ {*} a}
 is pattern ko Lk main samanyikaran suchak detaa he On the other hand, it is well known that the transitive finite automaton accepting the Lk language must have at least 2k k in many cases
 bhagyavash, regular oxpraishan se adhik aam aniyatatmak parimit autometa tak saral maanchitran he, jo achaanak itnaa bada visphotak aakaar grahan nahin kar letaa; yahi kaaran he ki nfas ko aksar suvyavasthit bhashaaon ke vaikalpik nirupan ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 nfas are simple transformations of the type-3 grammers of the Chomsky sequence
 ant main, yah dhyaan dene yogya baat he ki vastav jagat main anek regular oxpraishan engine aisi visheshtaon ko lagu karte hai, jise regular oxpraishan ke dwaara aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant ke arth main varnit nahin kiya ja saktaa; is vishay par adhikadhik jaankaree ke liye neeche dekhen
 As seen from the examples, various regular expressions can express the same language: formalism is unnecessary
 kalanvidhi main lekhan sambhav he jo die gaye regular oxpraishan ke madhya yah nirnay karne ke liye ki ullikhit bhashaaen anivaary rup se ek samaan hai ki nahin
 yah prayek abhivyakti ko nunatam niyatatmak parimit sthiti mashin kii had tak kam kar detaa he or nirdhaarit karata he ki kya ve samakritik samakaksh hai yaa nahin
 To what extent can this redundancy be removed? Can we find an interesting subset of regular expressions that are fully suggestive? An alliance of clean stars and sets is obviously necessary, but perhaps we can ban their use

 Regular expressions are so simple that there is no way to rewrite them in any form
 In the past the lack of self-certification led to the problem of Star Height

 Traditional Unix regular expression syntax did not follow common conventions, but often differed from device to device
 IEEE POSIX basic regular oxpraishan maanak khaskar ulti anukulata ke liye paramparaagat vaakya-vinyas ke saath ise dizine kiya gaya, kintu isane ek saamaanya maanak uplabdh karaayaa jise kai Unix regular oxpraishan upkarnon ke vyatikram vaale vaakya-vinyas ke rup main apana liya gaya he, haalanki isamen ab bhi aksar kuch vividhtaayen athwa atirikt visheshtaayen dikhaai detii hai
 There are several tools that support ERE syntax with command line topics
 BRE vaakya-vinyas main, adhikansh aksharon ko shabdic arth main liya jaataa he -- ve aapas main ek duusare se mail khate hai 
 neeche soochibaddh apwaadon ko aksharon se pare yaa anukramon se alag kaha jaataa he
 Examples: aksharon se pare kaa arth bekaslash se bachakar kuch aksharon ke liye POSIX vistrut regular oxpraishan ke vaakya-vinyas main vipareet he
 In this syntax itself, a backslash causes meta characters to be treated as literal characters
 atah udhaaharan ke liye, \ ab he or \ { \ } ab { }
 saath hi saath, pichley sandarbhon ke liye ko hataa liya gaya he or nimnlikhit aksharon se pare ko shaamil kiya gaya hai: Examples: |dog "cat " yaa "dog " ke saath mail khaataa he
 POSIX extended regular expressions can often be used with modern Unix applicability by including the command line flag -E
 chunki aksharon kii anek vargeekrut shreniyan chune hue sthaneey setting, POSIX maanak aksharon kii kuch shreniyon athwa virgon ko nimna talika main dikhaaya gaya he: POSIX character categories can only be used within parentheses
 udhaaharan ke liye, ab] ucchvarg ke bade aksharon evam chote aksharon "a " or "b " ke saath hi mail khaataa he
 In Perl's regular expression, coincides with and combines with
 ek atirikt gaiyr-posix shrenee ko kuch upkarnon ke dwaara samajha gaya he vah he, jise aamtaur par plus rekhankan underscore ke dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 This raises the fact that in many programming languages these are the characters that can be used as identification marks
 sampadak Vim aage verde or verde-head shrenee ke bich antar spasht karte hue pahchaan bataate hai 
 chunki kai programing bhashaaon main jo akshar pahchaan chihn ke rup main aarambh kar sakate hai ve unke samaan nahin hai, jo anya sthiti main upasthit ho sakate hai
 It is noted that POSIX regular expression standards call character classes in the color of other regular expressions, which support them, they are commonly referred to as POSIX character classes
 adhikansh anya regular oxpraishan flavors ke saath kairactor claces pad-bandha kaa prayog POSIX nirdhaarit koshthak suchakon kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Perl has a more consistent and rich syntax than POSIX Basic and Extended Regular Expression Standards
 isaki nirantarata kaa ek udhaaharan he ki \ hameshaa gaiyr-varnankit aksharon se alag bhaagta he
 Another example of functionality is possible with Perl, but not with POSIX - the subsequent regular expression concept of sluggish quantification
 vyapak rup se apni suchak kshamta ke kaaran kai anya prayojyata or programing kii bhashaaon ne vaakya-vinyas ko Perl kii hi tarah apana liya he -- udhaaharan ke liye, Java, javascript, PCRE, Python, Ruby, Microsoft's 
NET Framework or w3c's XML Schema sabhi regular oxpraishan vaakya-vinyas kaa prayog Perl kii hi tarah karte hai
 Some languages and tools such as Boost and PHP support multiple regular expression flavors
 Perl vyutpann regular oxpraishan ke karyanvayan main ekarupata nahin he or kuch keval Perl kii visheshtaon ke subset ko hi karyanvit karte hai
 The process of Perl 5

 saral regular oxpraishan aisa vaakya-vinyas he, jinka prayog computer aplication program ke aitihaasik sanskarnon main kiya ja saktaa he evam apane antargat kuch anuprayogon ke dwaara sahyog bhi paa saktaa he
 It has been deemed inappropriate for the purpose of providing previous conformity
 regular oxpraishan main maanak parimaapak laalchee hai arthath ve jitna mail kha sakate hai adhik se adhik utani baar mail khate hai, baaki ko rijex ke saath koi nayaa mail khaane ke liye chhod dete hai
 For example, someone new to regexes who wants to find the first instance between a single item can find between the symbols in this example
 ek or whale explozan, ko ghatit hua
 


 who would like to come with the pattern or similar
 However this pattern would actually like to go back to "" instead of "", which was expected, because * quantification is greedy - so it would want to consume as many characters as possible from input, and "january 26>, "will have more characters than" January 26 "
 haalanki is samasya ko kai tareekon se taala ja saktaa he, aadhunik regular oxpraishan upkaran ek parimank ko sust ke rup main vaishishty paane kii anumati dete hai parimank ke baad ek prashnchihn lagaakar kiya jaataa he, athwa sanshodhak kaa prayog kar jo parimank ke laalach ko ulat detaa he 
 sust parimank kaa prayog kar suchak sabase pehle kam se kam mail khaane kii koshish karte hai
 Although slack mail is used in the preceding example to select one of the results of multiple matches, in some cases it can also be used for better performance, when greedy matching needs to backfire
 
 avyavasthit bhashaaon ke liye pattern aadhunik regular oxpraishan sangrahon se praapt kai visheshtaayen suchak kshamta pradaan karti he jo suvyavasthit bhashaaon se bhi adhik ho jaati he
 For example, many implementations allow the grouping of subindexers and reminds the value of matching in the same indicator
 iskaa arth yah he ki ek pattern duhraaye gaye shabdon kii ladiyon se mail kha saktaa he, jaise ki "papa " athwa "wikiwiki ", jise aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant main squares kehete hai
 The pattern for these battles is \ 1
 haalanki, squares kii bhashaa suvyavasthit nahin he
 Nor is it free from the subject
 back refrences kii aseemit sankhyaon pattern ke saath mail khaataa, jaise ki aseemit sankhya main aadhunik upkaran dwaara samarthit, en pi-sampoorn he 
 However, many tools, libraries and engines that provide such structures still use regular expression terminology for their patterns
 isane regular oxpraishan shabdaawalee kaa namakaran kiya he, jiske aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant tathaa pattern ke kai bhinn arth hai
 For this reason, some people use regex or simply pattern terminology to interpret the latter
 parl programing bhashaa ke lekhak, laire wal ek niabandh main parl 6 ke dizin ke bare main likhte hai: There are at least three different Kalaan methods, algorithms that determine how a given regular expression matches a string
 sabase puraane or sabase tej parinaam par nirbhar do aupchaarik bhashaa siddhant jo prayek garaniyatatmak parimit sthiti yantra ko niyatatmak parimit sthiti mashin main roopantarit karnaa sweekaar karata he
 DFA can be explicitly constructed and then consequently operates on the input one symbol at a time
 ek regular oxpraishan ke aakaar ke liye DFA kaa nirmaan "O" kii keemat par karne par samay or smriti aa jaati he, lekin yah n aakaar ke string par hi o samay main chal saktaa he
 An alternative effort is to emulate the NFA directly, essentially creating each DFA position on demand and then dropping it out, possibly caching on the next step
 This keeps DFA implicit and the exponential cost of manufacture can be avoided, but the running cost increases to O
 is spasht padakshep ko DFA kalanvidhi kehete hai or antarnihit padakshep ko NFA kalanvidhi
 jaise ki ek samaan DFA ko kriyanvit karne main donon ko bhinn tareekon se dekha ja saktaa he, unhen bhi bina bhed-bhav ke aksar kalanvidhi kehete hai
 These algorithms are fast, but their use for returning grouped subheads is a tricky quantification and complicates similar features
 teesri kalanvidhi back trek ke dwaara pattern ke saath input string ke milan ke liye he
 This algorithm is commonly called NFA, but the terminology is unclear
 iskaa chalan samay ghaataanki ho saktaa he, jiskaa saral karyanvayan yah ujagar karata he ki jab suchakon ke khilaaf milan jaise ki *b jisame prayaavartan or aseemit parimann donon hi hai
 Emphasize the algorithm to consider the increasing exponential number of substitute cases
 More complex implementations often mark and speed up or cancel simple cases when their behavior is slowed
 haalanki back trekking karyanvayan sabase kharaab sthiti main ek ghaataanki guarantee dete hai, ve bahut adhik lacheelaapan or suchak shakti pradaan karte hai
 For example, any implementation that allows the use of backreferences or implements the various extensions implemented by Perl must use a back tracking implementation
 kuch karyanvayan sabase pehle tej DFA ko chalaakar do sabase acchhee kalan vidhiyaan uplabdh karaate hai, yah jaanane ke liye ki regular oxpraishan string ke saath thoda bhi mail khate hai yaa nahin or keval isi sthiti main sambhawatah mand back trekking milan hota he

 Premchand's novels are milestones not only in Hindi novel literature but also in Indian literature
 premachand katha-sahitya main unke upanyaaskaar kaa armbh pehle hota he

 Since Premchand was originally the author of Urdu and came from Urdu into Hindi, all his early novels were originally written in Urdu and later he was written in Hindi
 unhone 'sevasadan' upanyaas se hindi upanyaas kii duniya main pravesh kiya
 He originally wrote it in Urdu under the name 'bajare-hussan' but first published its Hindi form 'sevasadan'
 'sevasadan' ek nari ke veshya banane kii kahani he
 According to Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma, the main problem expressed in 'sevasadan' is the subordination of the Indian woman
 iske baad kisaan jivan par unka pehla upanyaas 'premashram' aayaa
 Its draft was also prepared in Urdu under the name 'goshaye-aafiyat', but like 'sevasadan' it was first published in Hindi
 'premashram' kisaan jivan par likhaa hindi kaa sambhawatah pehla upanyaas he
 It was written during the period of the peasant movements of Awadh
 iske baad 'rangabhumi', 'kayakalp', 'nirmala', 'gaban', 'karmbhumi' se hota hua yah safar 'godaan' tak purnataa ko praapt hua
 Premchand had started a revolutionary change in Hindi fiction by making Surdas, a blind beggar, a hero of fiction in Rangbhoomi
 godaan kaa hindi sahitya hi nahin, vishwa sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan he
 In it, Premchand's literary ideology achieves perfection from 'idealistic realism' to 'critical realism'
 ek saamaanya kisaan ko puure upanyaas kaa nayak bananaa bhartiya upanyaas parampara kii disha badal dene jaisaa tha

 But Godan's tactful ending is a witness to the fact that Premchand was disillusioned with idealism by then
 yah unki aakhri daur kii kahaniyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he

 a total of nine story collections were published during his lifetime - 'saapt Saroj', 'navnidhi', 'premapurnima', 'prem-pachisi', 'prem-pratima', 'prem-dwadashi', 'samarayatra', 'mansarovar': Parts one and two and 'shroud'
 unki mrityu ke baad unki kahaniyaan 'maansarovar' sheershak se 8 bhaagon main prakashit hui
 As soon as Premchand was free from the authority of literature, various editors and publishers prepared and published Premchand's stories
 unki kahaniyon main vishay or shilp kii vividhta he
 He has made the main characters in his stories from all classes of humans to animals and birds
 unki kahaniyon main kisaanon, mazdooron, striyon, daliton, aadi kii samasyaayein gambhirtha se chitrit hui hai
 He has written stories related to social reform, patriotism, freedom struggle etc
 unki aitihaasik kahaniyaan tathaa prem sambandhi kahaniyaan bhi kaaphi lokapriy sabit huin
 These names can be taken in the leading stories of Premchand - 'panch Parmeshwar', 'gulli Danda', 'doha Baalon Ka Katha', 'idgah', 'bade Bhai Sahab', 'pus Ki Raat', 'kafan', ' Thakur's well ',' Sadgati ',' Budhi Kaki ',' Tawan ',' Demolition ',' Price of milk ',' Mantra 'etc

, while editing magazines and magazines in the then other co-existing literary magazines 'chand', 'maryada', 'swadesh' etc
 Expressed from amritraay dwaara sampadit 'premchand : vividh prasang' vastav main premchand ke lekhon kaa hi sankalan he
 Premchand's articles have also been printed from the publication institute under the title 'some Thoughts'

 unke dwaara ratannath sarshar ke urdu upanyaas 'fasaan-e-aaazaad' kaa hindi anuwaad 'aaazaad katha' bahut mashhoor hua
 Premchand came to Hindi with the rite of Urdu and became a great Hindi writer
 hindi ko apana khaas muhaavara or khulaapan diya
 Both the story and the novel made epoch-making changes
 unhone sahitya main samayikta prabal aagrah sthapit kiya
 He made the common man the subject of his creations and, by openly penning his problems, placed him on the post of heroes of literature
 premchand se pehle hindi sahitya raja-rani ke kisson, rahasy-romaanch main ulajhaa hua tha
 Premchand took literature to the surface of truth

 Premchand is the era promoter of Hindi literature
 unhone hindi kahani main aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad kii ek nai parampari shuru kii
 Despite being such a great creator, Premchand's life is not free from accusations
 premchand ke adhyeta kamalkishor goyanka ne apni pustak 'premchand : adhyayan kii nai dishaaen' main premchand ke jivan par kuch aarope lagaakar unke sahitya kaa mahatv kam karne kii koshish kii
 The main allegations against Premchand are- Premchand left his first wife without any reason and even after second marriage, he had a relationship with another woman, Premchand cheated Vinodashankar Vyas in 'jagran Brawl', Premchand's senior press Employee Pravasi Lal Verma Frauded, Workers Strike in Premchand's Press, Premchand Supports Flick When His Daughter Sick Took more
 kamalkishor goyanka dwaara lagaae gaye ye aarope premchand ke jivan kaa ek paksh jarur hamaare saamne laate hai jisamen unki insaani kamajoriyon jaahir hoti hai lekin unke vyapak sahitya ke moolyankan par in aaropon kaa koi asar nahin pad paaya he
 People remember Prem Chandra today because of his ability which greatly reduces disputes
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke
 At that time Bankim was Babu, Sharat Chandra and in addition there were Russian writers like Tolstoy
 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
 jab bharat kaa swatantraaa andolan chal rahaa tha tab unhone katha sahitya dwaara hindi or urdu donon bhashaaon ko jo abhivyakti di usne siyaasi sargarmi ko, josh ko or andolan ko sabhi ko ubhaara or use taaqatvar banaaya or isse unka lekhan bhi taaqatvar hota gaya
 Premchand can certainly be called the first progressive writer of Hindi in this sense
 1936 main unhone pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan ko sabhapati ke rup main sambodhan kiya tha
 His speech became the basis of the manifesto of the progressive movement
 premchand ne hindi main kahani kii ek parampara ko janm diya or ek puri peedi unke kadamon par aage badi, 50-60 ke dashak main renu, nagarjun auki inke baad shrinath singh ne gramin parivesh kii kahaniyaan likhi hai, wo ek tarah se premchand kii parampara ke taratamya main aati hai
 Premchand was a revolutionary creator, he saw not only patriotism but also many evil practices prevalent in the society and put them before the people through the story
 unhone us samay ke samaaj kii jo bhi samasyaayen thim un sabhi ko chitrit karne kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 Dalits also come in it, women also

 The first processor to use this brand appeared in notebook computers in early 2007
 Those processors, named the Pentium T2060, T2080 and T2130, had a 32-bit Pentium M-derived Yonah core, and were almost identical to the Core Duo T2050 except for the use of a 1 megabyte L2 cache instead of a 2 megabyte cache

 At the time, British traders still operated on the wave of local rulers, and so did the unstable political upheaval by Hastings and his allies in Bengal, where the elderly middle Nawab Alivardi Khan was likely to be succeeded by his grandson Siraj
 ud-daula, though many other rival contenders were eyeing the throne
 This was increasingly unsafe in Bengal during the British Trade Post, as Siraj ud-daula was known for harboring anti-european views and likely to launch an attack once he took power
 When Alivardi Khan died in April 1756, British merchants and small outposts at Kasimbazar were abandoned, weakened
 par 3 Since June, being surrounded by a huge force, the British were persuaded a massacre is taking place to prevent the surrender

 In 1758, Hastings became a British resident in Murshidabad, the capital of Bengali - Clive on the cusp of his career a great step forward
 His role was in the city, apparently as an ambassador but came to Bengal, under the fast dominance of the East India Company he was often given by the new Nawab to issue work orders from Clive and Calcutta
 Authorities
 Reference error: The opening tag is bad or its name is bad
 Hastings personally sympathized with Mir Zafar and considered many of the demands placed on him as a company
 hestings ne pehle se hi viksit kii he ki ek darshan par aadhaarit tha sthapit karne kii koshish kar ek or adhik samaj ke saath sambandh bharat ke nivaasiyon or unke shaskaon, or vah aksar karne kii koshish kii madhyasthata se donon pakshon ke bich he 
 During the reign of Mir Zafar, the East India Company was moving into an increasingly larger role, and effectively took over the defense of Bengal against external invaders when the Bengal soldiers proved to be inadequate
 As she grew older, Mir Zafar became gradually less effective in the ruling state, and overthrowed British troops in 1760, with her power and place to replace her with Mir qasim
reference error: The opening tag is bad or her Name is bad
 Transferred from Calcutta to Hastings expressing his suspicions, they were obliged to respect the honor Mir Zafar, but his opinions were dismissed
 The new Nawab established good relations with Hastings and again had misgivings about the demands he relayed to his superiors
 unhone 1761 main waapas bulaayaa gaya tha or niyukt karne ke liye kalakatta parishad
 Hastings was personally offended when he conducted an investigation into abuses in the trade in Bengal
 unhone aarope lagaaya ki kuch europea or british-sambhddha bhartiya vyapaariyon the is sthiti kaa laabh lene ke liye khud ko samrudh vyaktigat rup se

 Hastings felt it was a shame to bring Britain's reputation, and he urged the ruling authorities to put an end to Calcutta

 Finally, little was done to stem the abuses, and Hastings began to consider leaving and then returning to Britain
 His resignation was the only delayed outbreak of lucrative fighting in Bengal
 Once on the throne, Qasim proved increasingly independent in his actions, and he again rebuilt the Bengal army by hiring European instructors and mercenaries who greatly improved the standard's forces
 Reference error: The opening tag is bad or its name is out of order
 He gradually felt more confident and at the disposal of a dispute broke out in Patna in 1764 when he captured his British garrison and threatened to execute him if the East India Company responded to the military
 When the soldiers sent to Calcutta anyway, Mir Kasim killed the hostages
 If the British forces went on there would be a series of battles and the conclusion of a decisive battle in Buxar in October 1764
 After this Mir Qasim was in exile in Delhi, where he later died

 Hastings' first wife, Mary, had died in 1759, and she planned to marry the model once she had obtained a divorce from her husband
 This process took a long time and it was not until 1777 when the news of the divorce came from Germany that Hastings was finally able to marry him

 This treaty failed in Madras, which ended the war, to resolve the dispute and after three further anglo-mysore wars
 During his time in Madras Hastings initiated reforms of trade practices which cut out the use of middlemen and profit both company and Indian laborers, but was otherwise relatively uneventful for the period

 He has given this theory in his work 'course of Positive Philosophy' published in 1822
 unke dwaara bataae gayi teen charan ye hai- Nature writes our genetic, that is, genetic code in only the four-letter alphabet
 ye chaar akshar hai angrezi ke AGCT
 chaaron, chaar rasinic kshaaron ke pratik hai-- Not only is it not only easy to read this code despite having only four letters or four bases, it also takes a lot of time, although now there are also machines available that can read genetic material written as DNA formulas at the press of a button
 Huh
 kintu, in mashiinon ko bhi jaivaracinic kriyaaon se judi asankhya gananaayen kerani padati hai, jisamen kai-kai ghante lag jate hai
 To get rid of this, a researcher from Dortmund in Germany has found a way to calculate the biochemical functions without directly reading the genetic code
 ab tak kaa tarika yah he ki sikvencial robet kahalaane vaali mashine anuvanshik saamagree ko, arthath di en e ko, enzymon kii sahaata se chote-chhete tukdon main baant detii hai
 These fragments are copied many times before, like many pieces of a pictogram, i

 they are copied and then sorted with the help of light molecules
 rasayanashastra main doctor kii oopaadhi praapt, dortmund ke folkar dekirt ise bahut jatil maanate hai or chaahate hai ki anuvanshik code ko padhanaa bhi utana hi saral-sahaj hona chaiye, jitna kisi super market ke cash-counter par scinar kii sahaayta se kisi vastu kaa mulya bataane vaala baar-code padhanaa
 Folker Deckert is currently testing a method in his laboratory at the Institute for Analytical Sciences — ISAS — at Dortmund, which could revolutionize the reading of genetic code written as DNA
 prayogshaala main lagbhag andhera rahata he or bahari awaazen bhi nahin aa saktin: It is a specialized laboratory

 The sample itself is placed on a small plate
 microscope yaa sookshamdarshi to vaisaa hi he, jaisaa bazaar main uplabdh ek acha sookshamdarshi hona chaiye
 However, the table on which he is placed in the laboratory is a special table that suppresses external vibrations

 rnas are actually analogous to DNA
 mukhya antar yah he ki di en e yadi dohari, yani do samanaantar pairon vaali ghumaavdaar seedhi ke samaan dikhte hai, to aar en e ikhari, yani ek hi pair vaali anthndaar seedhi ke samaan hote hai
 To know the genetic code of RNA molecules, the very fine needle of another microscope rotates over them by carefully touching them: namoona saamaanya sookshmdarshi or tathakthith random power microscape ke thik bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 If we wish, the random power microscope can scan one atom of the sample
 lekin hamen is seemaa tak jane kii zarurat nahin padati
 maheen sui-jaisi is spershika ke dwaara, jise hamane swayan banaaya he, prakaash kii maatra ko badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Light can not only be increased, it can also be concentrated at a particular point
 isiilie ham yahan kisi saamaanya sookshmdarshi kii tulana main bahut-si baariqiyon ko kahin behatar dekh sakate hai
 This extremely powerful observation and analysis method, combining two microscopes, is called Raman-spectroscopy based on the Raman-effect discovered by the Indian scientist Chandrashekhar Vekat Raman
 chandrashekhar venkat raman ko apni khoj ke liye 1930 main bhautik vigyaan kaa nobel puraskaar mila tha
 He was the first Indian to receive any Nobel Prize in science
 raman spectruroscopy par aadhaarit is scanning takanic main hota yah he ki saamaanya sookshmdarshi ke lens ke raste se pareekshan-namoonay par leisure prakaash daalaa jaataa he
 This light causes vibrations in molecules with genetic codes

 With its help, small pieces of material with genetic code can be targeted in a very targeted manner
 unke dwaara paravarti leisure kirnon se turant pataa chal jaataa he ki anuvanshik code vaale koun se anu thik is samay kaanp rahe hai: Like fingerprints, every molecule has its own unique identity
 isi kaa ham faaydaa uthaate hai
 Each alkali on the DNA formula has its own different vibrations
 in spandanon kii sahaayta se ham pahchaan sakate hai ki koun-sa anu adenin kaa he yaa koun-sa cytosin kaa yaa koun-sa kis kaa he
 The reflected light tells which molecule is oscillating right now
 yahi sari trick he
 Another trick is adopted
 aar en e sutara kii har kshareey eent ko ek-ek kar thonknaa-bajaanaa kyonki bahut pechida siddh ho saktaa he, isliye folkar dekirt kai-kai anuon ke companon ko ek hi saath maapte hai
 The gradual changes in their vibrations at the time of scanning give an indication of the order of their location on the RNA formula
 is tarah aar en e yaa di en e ko tukade-tukade main baantne or unki hazaron pratilipiyaan banane kii zarurat nahin rah jaati, jaisaa aajkal he
 The experiences that we have found on the basis of our first measurements show that the spectrum of the genetically coded bases, that is, the spectrum is very similar
 duusare shabdon main, ham bahut bharose ke saath kah sakate hai ki ham har base, har kshar ke bich antar kar sakate hai
 Folker Deckert also states that there is also no problem in principle of using the Dosutri DNA in lieu of monotonic rnas to read one's genetic code
 unka anumaan he ki paanch se chah varshon main unke genetical code reader kaa aisa pehla model taiyaar ho jaayegaa, jise bazaar main utaara ja saktaa he
 Then, on the basis of DNA analysis, it will be easier to apprehend and punish a criminal, to identify the real father of a child or an unknown deceased correctly, all the time taken in this is very less

 One such bridge was built in London in 1176 which was built of stones
 1779 se pulon main lohe or ispaat kaa bhi istemaal kiya jane laga
 By this time the bridges were small, but with time the need to build bridges above the seas was also felt

 The international standard is interpreted as the ISO xxrep 5 n heading, where xxrep 5 n is the standard number, xxrep 4 y is the year of publication, and the heading indicates the subject
 If the standard is the result of the work of the Joint Technical Committee JTC1, then the IEC is also included

 The Latin word 'colonia' means a property that is systematically established among foreigners

 It is not necessary for imperialism to seize a country and send its occupiers there and establish their administration

 However, it is necessary for colonialism to establish its own colony in the conquered country, the majority of the aggressor's conquests by directing themselves to be superior and to impose their own laws and decisions
 aisa karne ke liye samrajyavaadee vistaar ko ek khaas vichaardhaara kaa tark hasil karnaa aavashyak tha
 This role was played by the philosophy of John Locke, propounded in the seventeenth century
 lock kii sthapanaaon main britain dwaara bheje gayi adhivaasiyon dwaara america kii dharti par kabza kar lene kii karrwai ko nyaaysangat tehraane kii daleelein maujuud thim
 The second thesis of his work 'two Treatise on Civil Government' is about a person claiming his rights in 'prakrit Status'
 ve aisi jagahon par naagarik shashan sthapit karne or vyaktigat prayaas dwaara hathiyaan gayi smapda ko apane laabh ke liye viksit karne ko jaays qaraar dete hai
 This thesis later became the basis for accepting the disproportionate ownership of the earth
 lock kii manyata thi ki america main anaap-shanaap zamin bekaar padi hui he or vahaan ke muulavaasi yani indian is dharti kaa sadupyog karne kii yogyata se vanchit hai
 Locke calculated that if an acre of land in Europe gives a profit of five shillings per year to its owner, then the total profit of the Indian settled on it from American land is much less than a penny
 chunki america indian baaki maanavtaa main prachlit dhan-aadhaarit vinimay-pranali apnaane main naakaam rahe hai, isliye ‘sampatti ke adhikaar’ ke mutabik unki dharti ko adhigrahit karke us par maanviya shram kaa nivesh kiya janaa chahie
 In this lock's thesis there were seeds of the European superiority gland on the civilization and culture of the Asian and American continents, on the basis of which the colonization of colonial structures was built
 upniveshon mukhyatah do kismein thim
 On one side there were countries like America, Australia and New Zealand whose climate was comfortable for Europeans

 They not only took full control of the local population by carrying out massive projects of destruction and repression, but they turned their country into their own 'homeland'

 On the other hand, there were colonies whose air-water was hostile to the Europeans
 in deshon par kabza karne ke baad european thodi sankhya main hi vahaan based or mukhyatah aarthik shoshan or dohan ke liye un dharatiyon kaa istemaal kiya
 There were also a few colonies like New England which were founded by European Christians in search of religious freedom
 vyapaarik kranti main bhugolic khojon ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 Colonialism began with these geographical discoveries
 spain, portugal, dach, france evam england aadi europea deshon ne sudur deshon main upnivesh sthapit kiye
 Following were the reasons for the onset of colonialism in Europe - bhugolic khojon ke falswaroop columbus dwaara america kii khoj ne europea deshon main swarna jaisi bahumoolya dhaatu ke sangrah kii pratisparddha aarambh kii
 The competitive position of gold-collection was that the slogan of 'more gold, more prosperity, more fame' was raised all over Europe
 ab samast europea rashtron kaa pramukh dhyaan sona, kirti evam ishwar arthath Gold, Glory and God par kendrit ho gaya
 With the establishment of colonies, European countries also got gold, fame spread and religion was also promoted
 atah tripal g niti nihsandeh upniveshon kii sthapana kaa ek kaaran avashya thi
 Commercial prosperity resulted in the establishment of many industries in European countries
 europe main in udyogon ke liye aavashyak kachche maal kii kami thi
 Therefore, European countries established natural resources and colonies in African and Asian countries to obtain raw materials
 udyogon kii sthapana evam kachche maal kii uplabdhta se audyogic utpaadan teevr gati se badha
 Because at this time all European countries were following the policy of economic protection
 atah is nirmit maal ko khapaane ke liye bhi upniveshon kii sthapana kii gayi
 That is, each of the colonies was forced to purchase forcibly manufactured goods and export raw materials by powerful nations
 europe ke vibhinn deshon main audyogikaran ke parinamswaroop nagaron kii jansankhya main atyaadhik vruddhi hui
 Later, the establishment of colonies was also encouraged to settle the surplus population

 He was also addicted to hot spices, sugar, coffee, rice etc
 pratikul jalwaayu ke kaaran ye sabhi vastuen europea deshon main ugaana sambhav na tha
 Therefore, the British wanted European experts to get such areas where they could be cultivated
 atah anukool jalwaayu vaale sthanon main upnivesh sthapana kii vichaardhaara ko bal mila
 Portugal and Spain established the early colonies as a result of geographical discoveries
 isse unki samruddhi main vruddhi hui
 Therefore, in view of their prosperity, other European countries also started colonizing in the craving for prosperity

 In this context, Marxist scholars distinguish between colonialism before and after the rise of capitalism
 marks ne apni bharat sambandhi rachanaaon main upniveshwaad par khaas taur se vichaar kiya he
 Marx and Engels were of the view that controlling the colonies was necessary not only to grab markets and sources of raw materials, but also to overtake rival industrial nations
 upniveshwaad sambandhi marxvaadi vichaaron ko aage viksit karne kaa shrey roza luckjamburg or lenin ko jaataa he
 The Marxist perspective has also faced criticism
 aalochakon kaa kahana he ki marks, roza or lenin ne apni thisis ke paksh main jo pramaan pesh kiye hai ve paryaapt nahin hai, kyonki unase audyogic kranti va poonjeewaad ke vikaas ke liye upniveshwaad kii anivaaryta sabit nahin hoti
 Secondly, Marxist analysis does not have sufficient study and understanding of colonized societies
 marks jis asian utpaadan pranali kii charchaa karte hai or roza jis kii shreniyon ko asian samaajon par aropit karti hai, unhen in samaajon ke itihaas ke gahan adhyayan ke aadhaar par bahut dur tak nahin khinchaa ja saktaa
