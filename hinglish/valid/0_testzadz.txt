 Shakti mossfat or 'power mossfat' are special types of mossfets that can handle relatively more electric power
 arthath ye adhik voltata yaa adhik dhara yaa adhik voltata or dhara ko handls karne main sakasham hote hai
 The main advantage of using them over other power-electronic devices such as IGBT, SCR, etc
 is that they can be switched on at higher frequency
 shakti-paripathon ko jitani adhik aavriti par chalaaya jaataa he, unamem lagane vaale prerakatv, transformar, sandharitra aadi kaa aakaar utane hi chote hote hai
 Power Mossfate is particularly efficient when working at low voltages, so the use of power mossfets gives more efficiency
 adhik voltata vaale power mosspheton kii chaalu avasthaa kaa pratirodh adhik hota he jiske kaaran inke upyog se adhik shakti kshay hota he or kam dakshata praapt hoti he
 For this reason, power mossfet is the most commonly used switch at low voltage
 shakti mossphate ke kaary karne kaa tarika vahi he jo kam shakti par kaam karne vaale mossphate kaa he
 When CMOS technology for IC manufacturing developed in the late 1970s, Mossfet was born
 1980 ke dashak ke armbh main jab pratham shakti mospheton kaa vikaas hua tab bahuteri sanrachanaon ko aajamaaya gaya
 But most of them have now been discarded and vertical diffused moss has proved to be the most suitable structure
 saamne ke chitra main videmos kii anuprastha kaat dikhaayi gayi he
 From this the verticality of this device can be seen
 drashtavy he ki iskaa 'sorce' electrode 'dren' ke upar avasthit he jiske kaaran chaalu avasthaa main isamen dhara urdhvadhar disha main bahegi
 To be fair, the structure of the Shakti Mossfets is different from the 'lateral Mossfets'
 shakti mossphate kii sanrachana 'planer' na hokar urdhvadhar hoti he
 In the context of electric power distribution, the busbar is a rod or strip made of an electrical conductor metal which is used for high current flow
 inkaa upyog vidyut swichayard main ucch voltata vaale upkarnon ko jodne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Often no electrical tilt is installed above the busbar
 isse inako thanda hone main suvidha hoti he tathaa inke kisi sthaan se duusari basbaar yaa cabel jodne main suvidha hoti he
 The cable basbaar Champu is a distinction of audio poetry, that is, mixed poetry of prose-verse is called Champu
 gadhy tathaa padya mishrit kavy ko "champu" kehete hai
 This mode of poetry has not been mentioned by the ancient masters of literature - Bhamah, Dandi, Vamana etc
 yon gadhy padyamay style kaa prayog vaidic sahitya, buddha jataka, jatakamala aadi ati pracheen sahitya main bhi miltaa he
 The beginning of the Champukavya tradition is derived from the Atharva Veda
 champoo naam ke prakrut kavy kii rachana dasvin shatee ke pehle nahin hui
 'nalchampu', composed by Trivikram Bhatt, which is an early tenth century work, is a famous example of Champu
 iske atirikt somdev suri dwaara rachit yashatilak, bhojraj krit champoo ramayana, kavi karnapuri krit anandavrindavan, gopal champoo, nilkantha champoo or champoo bharat dasvin se satrahavin shatee tak ke udhaaharan hai
 This poetic form could not become more popular nor did it get special recognition in poetry
 hindi main yashodhara ko champoo-kavy kaha jaataa he, kyonki usamen gadhy-padya donon kaa prayog hua he
 The proper division of this mixture of prose and verse seems to be that the description of affective subjects should be presented by verse and descriptive subjects should be presented by prose
 parantu champurchayitaaon ne is manovaigyanik vaishishty par vishesh dhyaan na dekar donon ke sanmishran main apni swatantra ichha tathaa vaiyaktik abhiruchi ko hi mahatv diya he
 The mixture of prose-poetry is ancient in Sanskrit literature, but the poetic style, the possessive noun of "champu", cannot be considered as ancient as the compositional mixture of prose-verse
 gadhy-padya kii mishrit rachana krishna yajurvedic samhitaon main uplabdh hoti he
 Pali natives also have the achievement of the storyline in prose and the original formulaic allusions in verse
 parantu kavyatatv se virahit hone ke kaaran inhen ham "champu" kaa drushtaant kisi prakaar nahin maan sakate
 The Prayagprashasti of Samudragupta composed by Harishan and the Buddhist poet Ayanshur Praneeth Jatakamala can be considered primitive forms of Champu, as in the first, the Digvijay of Samudragupta and 34 Jatakas in the second are described in elaborate prose verse taking shelter of pure poetic style
 prathit hota he ki champu gadhykavy kaa hi ek paribrihit rup he or isiliye gadhykavy ke suvarnyug ke ananthar navam shatee ke aasapaas is kavyarup kaa udai hua
 The first paradigm of Champu poetry is the Nalchampu of Trivikram Bhatt in which the characteristic of Champu springs up
 dakshin ke rashtrakutvanshi raja krishna ke pautra, raja jagatug or lakshmi ke putr, indraraj ke aashray main rahakar trivikram ne is ruchir champu kii rachana kii thi
 The coronation of Indraj was in the year 972 and due to his dependence, the poet also has the same time as the first half of the tenth century
 is champu ke saat uchhvaason main nal tathaa damayanti kii vikhyath pranaykatha kaa bada hi chamatkaari varnan kiya gaya he
 In poetry, the Prasad of Shubhasa Sambhava Shlasa is targeted everywhere
 jain kavi somprabhasuri kaa "yashastilak champu" dasham shatee ke madhyakaal kii kriti he 
 The philosopher Rashtrakutnaresh was the synagogue of the son of Krishna's feudatory Chalukya Arikeshri
 is champu main jain puraanon main prakhyat raja yashodhar kaa charitra vistaar ke saath varnit he
 In the last three abuses of Champu by presenting a detailed account of the principles of Jainism, the poet has sufficiently propagated these principles
 granth main us yug ke naanavidh dharmik, aarthik tathaa saamaajik vishyon kaa vivaran somprabhasuri kii vyapak tathaa bahumukhi vandushi kaa parichaayak he
 Many talented poets have demonstrated their talent by reciting the charitas of Rama and Krishna
 aise champu kaavyon main bhojraj kaa ramayana champu, anantbhatta kaa "bharat champu", shesh shrikrishna kaa "parijataharan champu" kaaphi prasiddh hai
 Bhojraj had composed the Ramayana Champu till the Kishkindha scandal, which was completed by Lakshman Bhatt, "yudh Kand" and Venkatraj composed the "uttara Kanda"
 jain kaviyon ke samaan chaitanya mataavlambee vaishnav kaviyon na apane siddhanton ke pasar ke liye is lalit kavyamadhyam ko badi safalataa se apanaaya
 The theme of Lord Sri Krishna's Lalaam Leelas is such a beautiful occasion when these poets presented the offerings of their extraordinary talent to the devout readers through their champu poems
 kavi karnpur kaa anandavrindavan champu, tathaa jeev goswami kaa gopalchampu saras kavy kii drushti se nitant safal kavy hai
 The first of these poems gives a detailed and vivid description of Krishna's balalilas, the second verse is a poignant description of Krishna's entire character
 "virmitroday" ke prakhyat rachayita mitra mishra kaa "aanandakand champu" krishnaparak champuon main ek ruchir shrunkhlaa jodta he
 In South India too, Champukyas were not less popular
 nilkanth dikshit kaa "nilkanthavijay champu" samudrmanthan ke vishay main he 
 Sri Vaishnava Venkatadhwari's "vishvagunadarsha Champu" is unique from other champs in that it has inaugurated the defects and virtues in many of India's numerous pilgrimages, religions and scribes together
 yah vishesh lokapriy kavy he
 The "chitrachampu" of Vanishvara Vidyalankar is a composition of a typical Pandit poet of Bengal in which Bhakti's attainment by Bhakti is indicated through a succinct narrative in Rupakshali
 is prakaar sanskrit sahitya main bhaavon ke prakaton ke nimitt anek shatabdiyon tak lokapriy madhyam hone par bhi uttar bhartiya bhashasahitya main champu kavy drudhmul na ho sakaa
 Generally, in the literature of Dravidi language, especially in Kerala and Andhra literature, Champu poetry is popular even today, which attracts the attention of poets towards the practice
 maheshwar shahar madhya pradesh ke khargon jila main sthit he
 The city of Maheshwar, Haihayavanshi King Sahasrarjuna, who defeated Ravana, Raj Rajeshwar Sahastrarjun, with his 500 queens, stopped the flow of the river with his one thousand arms while playing in the Narmada River, at the same time, Ravana in his Pushpak plane from the sky

Due to the persecution of sage Jamadagni, his son Parshuram had to fight, Rajarajeshwar Sahastrarjun was the Sudarshan Chakra incarnation of Lord Vishnu, both of them were not coming to an end, then Sahastrarjunji proposed to repent before Lord Dattatreya! At the behest of Lord Dattatreya, Rajarajeshwar entered the Shivalinga enshrined in the temple of Lord Shankar at Sahastrajun Maheshwar
 Later, it was also the capital of the great goddess Ahilyabai Holkar

 At the forefront of the emerging trend of social networking sites are the principles of "real-time web" and "location based"
 real-time prayogkartaaon ko saamagree ko aplod karne ke saath hi ise prasaarit karne kii anumati detaa he - yah avadharana radio or televijan prasaaran ke samaan he
 The concept of real-time was introduced by Twitter, in which users could broadcast what they were doing or thinking around the world
 fasebuk ne bhi yahi apni "fid live" ke dwaara kiya jisamen prayogkartaaon kii gatividhiyon ko hone ke saath hi pradarshit kiya ja saktaa tha
 While Twitter focuses on words, Clixter which is another real-time service, allows users to broadcast pictures of an event at the time of the event, focusing on group photo sharing

 In location-based social networking, Foursquare gained popularity because it allowed users to "check-in" to places where others also congregate
 gowala bhi aisi hi ek seva he jo forsquare kii tarah hi kaary karti he, yah phonon main uplabdh jeepies kshamta kaa laabh lete hue sthanik anubhav paidaa karti he
 Clixter, although part of the real-time category, is also a location-based social networking site, as it automatically geographically tags events created by users, and Clixter iphones the events happening around the user
 Can view with the help of app
 haal hi main, yelp ne apni mobile phone ap ke dwaara check-in ke zariye sthaan aadhaarit saamaajik netwarking shrenee main apane pravesh kii ghoshnaa kii he; yah forsquare athwa gowala ke liye hanikaarak hoga yaa nahin, yah to samay hi batayega kyonki internet takneekee udyog main abhi yah ek nayi shrenee he
 a popular application for this new technology is social networking among industries
 companiyon ne paaya he ki fasebuk or twitor jaisi saamaajik netwarking citen apni brands chhavi banane ke achche tareeke hai
 According to Jodi Nimez, author of Marketing Jive, there are five uses of industries and social media: to generate brand awareness, as an online image management tool, to recruit, to learn about new technologies and competitors, and to generate leads
 As a means of finding potential customers
 ye companiyaan apni online citon ke liye trephic utpann karte hue apane upabhoktaaon or graahakon ko apane utpaadon yaa sevaaon main parivartan athwa sudhaar ke vishay main vichaar-vimarsh karne ke liye protsaahit kar sakati hai
 Another use that is being discussed is the use of social networking in science communities
 julia porter libeskind tathaa anya ne ek adhyayan prakashit kiya he ki kaise nai jaev-praudyogiki form vaigyanik gyaan ke aadan-pradaan ke liye saamaajik netwarking citon kaa upyog kar rahi hai
 In their study, they state that by sharing information and knowledge with each other, "their learning and flexibility have increased, which in themselves would not have been possible within a limited hierarchical organization"
 Social networking has made it possible for scientific groups to spread ideas while expanding their knowledge base, and in the absence of these tools their theories could have been "isolated and irrelevant"
 saamaajik netwarkingon kaa prayog shikshakon or chaatro ke dwaara ek sanchaar upkaran ke rup main kiya ja rahaa he
 As most of the students were already using a wide range of social networking sites, teachers have started to familiarize themselves with this trend and now they use it to their advantage
 shikshak or praadhyaapak chat-room forum or samoohon ko srujit karke, kaksha kii paricharchaa ko badhaate hue, test va prashnottaree saunpna, kaksha ke baahar grihakaarya main madad aadi sab kuch kar rahe hai
 Social networking is also being used to promote dialogue between parents of teachers and students
 ye citen chaatro ke mata-pita ke liye shikshakon se bina mili prashn poochne tathaa apni chintaaon ko vyakt karne ko sambhav or suvidhajanak banaati hai
 Social networking is being used by activists as a means of low-cost grassroots organizing
 saamaajik netwarking citon kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa ke upyog se 2009 ke rashtriya samta march ke aayojakon dwaara lagbhag 200,000 pratibhaagiyon ko lamaband karke washington main march karne ke liye sakasham kiya, laagat main bachat puraane tareekon ke mukaable 85% se adhik kii rahi
 The use of online social networking by libraries is prevalent and growing, which is being used for interaction with potential users of the library as well as for expanding the library services
 saamaajik netwarkingon kaa ek bada prayog college ke chaatro dwaara vyavsaay sambandhi vyaktiyon se sampark karke in samparkon kaa prayog prashikshan tathaa naukari ke maukon ko talashne ke liye kiya ja rahaa he
 Among the many studies on the impact of online networking in a college, one notable study is published as Advances in Social Networking Analysis by Phipps Arabi and Yoram Wind
 koi saamaajik netwarking hosting seva ek web hosting seva hi hoti he jo vishesh rup se web aadhaarit saamaajik netwarking seva ke prayogkarta banane ke saath hi kai sambandhit aplicoshan ko host karti he
 Such services are also called vertical social networking as they ensure the creation of SNS by which the interests and goals of a particular user can be achieved; Similar to large, interest-skeptical snss, such nix networking services can provide the basis for ever-increasing target groups of users
 kuch saamaajik netwarking vartmaan main sadsyta ke liye dhan lete hai
 This may be partly because social networking is a relatively new service and the importance of using it has not yet been firmly established in customers
 fasebuk or mispes jaise companiyaan online vigyaapan se dhan arjeet karti hai
 Their business model is based on large membership numbers and taking money for membership would be contrary to interests
 kuch kaa maananaa he ki citon ke prayogkartaaon ke vishay main gahari jaankaree ke dwaara kisi anya sait kii tulana main behatar lakshith vigyaapan kiye ja sakate hai
 Social networking operates with an autonomous business model, in which members of a social networking function in dual roles as suppliers and consumers of content
 yah ek paaramparik vyapaar model ke vipareet he, jahaan aapurtikarta or upabhokta alag kaarak hote hai
 In the autonomous business model, revenue is earned through advertising, but subscription-based revenue is possible only when membership numbers and content levels are sufficiently high
 badi saamaajik netwarking sevaaon par badhati chintaaon main prayogkartaaon dwaara adhik vyaktigat jaankaree uplabdh karaayaa janaa tathaa yon shoshakon kaa khatra sammilit he
 Users of these services also need to be aware of data theft and viruses
 haalanki, mispes or netlog jaisi badi sevaayen ghatnaon ko rokane ke prayaas main aksar kanoon pravartan ke saath kaary karti hai
 In addition, there is a perceived threat of privacy related to possessing too much personal information, with large corporations or governmental entities having this personal information, profiles can be used in relation to the behavior of a person, with the help of judicious judgment against that person Can be taken
 iske alaava, data par niyantran kaa bhi vishay he - prayogkarta dwaara badal athwa hataa di gayi soochna vastav main saheji rakhi ja sakati he tathaa anya pakshon ko di ja sakati he
 This danger came to light when the controversial social networking site Cuchup used them for spamming by taking e-mail addresses from users' accounts
 medical or vaigyanik anusandhan main, vyaktiyon se poochi gayi soochnaaon ko sansthagat punarikshan parishad dwaara baariki se dekha jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye kishoron tathaa unke mata-pita se anumati le lee gayi ho
 It is unclear whether this applies to researchers who collect data from social networking sites
 in citon par aksar atyadhik data rahata he jo ki paramparaagat sadhano ke madhyam se praapt kiya janaa bahut kathin hota he
 Although data is public, republishing it in a research paper is considered an invasion of privacy
 saamaajik netwarking citon par gopneeyata ko kai karkon dwaara kam kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, users keep many personal information, third-parties can often use this data for various purposes if sites do not take adequate steps to protect user privacy
 "net peedi ke liye, saamaajik netwarking citen saamaajik baatcheet kaa pasandida madhyam ban gayi hai, dikhaave tathaa bhoomika nibhaane se lekar alag dhwani utpann karne tak
 tathaapi, chunki is tarah ke manchon kaa prayog apekshaakrit aasaani se kiya ja saktaa he, post kii gayi saamagree ko prayogkarta kii vyaktigat soochnaaon main ruchi rakhane vaale kisi vyakti ke dwaara bhi dekha ja saktaa he"
 The UK government's plan to monitor the traffic of social networks that have the ability to stop e-mail is proposed to be monitored on Facebook and Twitter
 in main "frending" tathaa "phaloing" ke zariye niruddeshy logon ke liye netwarking ke vishleshan ke prayaas ko vifal karnaa shaamil hoga
 One trend of social networking sites is to only send 'positive' notifications to users
 udhaaharan ke liye bebo, fasebuk va mispes jaisi citen prayogkartaaon ko tab soochna nahin bhejte hai jab koi unako mitra suchi se nikaal detaa he
 Similarly, if a user goes up on another user's friends list, then Bebo sends this notification, but when they go down this list, no information is sent
 iske kaaran prayogkartaaon ko avaanchit vyaktiyon ko bina kisi takaraav ke apni suchi se nikaalnaa aasaan ho jaataa he, kyonki kisi mitra ke apni suchi se gaayab ho jane par koi virala hi dhyaan de paata he
 It also helps to maintain a normal positive environment on the website, regardless of unpleasant events such as friend rejection, failed relationship breakdowns, etc
 kai saamaajik netwarking sevaayen, jaise fasebuk, prayogkarta ko yah chunane kaa vikalp pradaan karti hai ki koun log uski profil dekh sakate hai
 This prevents unauthorized users from accessing their information
 kishoron kii ek badi samasya unke mata-pita dwaara apane bachche ke mispes yaa fasebuk khate ko dekha janaa he, jo ki aisa nahin chaahate hai
 By making their profile private, teens can choose that only users who have been 'friends' can view their profile and thus prevent parents from viewing the profile
 kishor nirantar apane mata-pita or apane nijee jivan ke bich ek sanrachanaatmak avrodh lagane kii koshish kar rahe hai
 Login or password is required to edit information in a social networking service account
 is prakaar anadhikrut prayogkarta ko vyaktigat jaankaree, chitron or / yaa anya data daalane, badalane yaa hataane se roka ja saktaa he
 Regarding the relative freedom provided by social networking services, there is a possibility of its misuse by patrons
 oktober 2006 main, joush ivance ke naam se lori driu dwaara banaayin gayi ek nakli mispes profile ke kaaran megan mear ne aatmahatya kar lee
 The incident sparked global concerns regarding the use of social networking services to threaten

 may 2010 main, bacchon kii pornography vaali ek saamaajik netwarking site jisamen saikadon sadsy the, ko kanoon pravartan ke dwaara dhwast kiya gaya
 It was considered "the biggest crime committed by anyone, anywhere, against children"
 fasebuk jaisi saamaajik netwarking citon kaa ek aam durupyog yah he ki kisi vyakti ko kabhi-kabhi bhaavnaatmak rup se pratadit kiya jaataa he
 Such works are referred to as trolling
 vaastavik duniya ke takaraavon ko online kiya janaa durlabh nahin he
 Trolling can take place in many different forms, for example in the tribute pages of deceased persons for their character abuses, name calling, online slut jokes from sensitive individuals and controversial comments to generate anger and controversy
 troling ko sibar-dhamkiyon se alag samajha janaa chahie
 Online bullying is a relatively common occurrence and often results in emotional trauma towards the victim
 netwarking sait ke aadhaar par, lagbhag 39% prayogkarta sibar dhamkee praapt hone ko sweekaarte hai
 Dana Boyd, a researcher of social networks, quotes a teenager in her article Why Youth Social Networks site
 kishor mispes jaisi netwarking citon ke prati niraashaa vyakt karata he kyonki ye uske bhaavnaatmak tanaav kaa kaaran banati hai or vah unamem bahut naatakeeyata paata he

 Many social networking contacts provide online facilities for people to interact and exchange personal information to meet
 iske peeche logon ke iraade alag-alag ho sakate hai, jaise, kisi ke saath sirf ek baar milanaa, kuch samay ke liye sambandh bananaa or lambe samay ke liye sambandh bananaa aadi
 In most of these social interaction networking, like online dating facilities, certain information is required by the user

 Online dating sites are similar to social contact sites in that both of them provide an outline of their respective information to contact and meet other people but one of their activities on dating sites is The only purpose is to search for someone of your interest for dating
 saamaajik sampark suvidhaayen aavashyak rup se dating ke liye nahin hai; anek upyogkarta iskaa prayog apane mitron or sahakarmiyon se sampark banaaye rakhane ke liye karte hai
 However, one important difference between social contact networking and online dating facilities is that online dating sites usually have to pay a fee while social contact sites are free

 In 1818, the teenage Abraham Lincoln lives with his parents in Indiana, Nancy and Thomas, both of whom used to plant saplings in Jack Bart's fields
 vahiin par, linkan ko ek gulam bechnewali dwaara apane africa-america dost, wiliam janson kii pitayee dekh maamle main bich-bachaav karnaa padataa he
 Thus, Thomas is dismissed from the acts of his own son
 usee raat, linkan apane ghar par bart ko chori-chupe ghuskar, uski maa par jhapatate dekhtaa he
 Nancy falls ill almost the same day, soon after which she dies
 thomas nanhen linkan ko bataata he bart ne hi uski maa ko zehar diya he, lekin use yah bhi kasam dilwaai jaati he ki wo uski maut kaa badla lene kii himakat nahin karegaa
 Nine years later, after his father's death, the restless Lincoln breaks his oath of revenge, and attacks Bart while waiting in the dock, but Bart is a vampire that quickly overcomes him
 haalaanki, bart use maar daalata, linkan kii jaan ek or ajanabi henry sterges bachaa letaa he
 In the morning, his unconscious opens at Henry's house, and where Sturges reveals vampires want to create a new world of their existence in this century, and in return he invites Lincoln to become a vampire hunter
 linkan apni manjuuri detaa he or, ek dashak tak shikaar ke gur sikhte hue, is safar main vah springfield, illinois se guzarate hue, sanyukt raashtra ke kai shaharon main dehshat ban chuke pishaachon kaa muqaabala, apni madyphid chaandi jadi hui kulhadi se karata
 According to Sturges, the main cause of the spread of this animal disease in America is the ancient vampire named Adam, who lives with his sister, Vadama, owner of agricultural lands in New Orleans
 sterges un pishaachon kii ekmaatr kamajoriyon ke bare main linkan ko bataata he, jo he chaandi, or iske liye vah bataur tohfa ek chaandi kii jeb ghadi detaa he or uske is muhim main safal hone kii ummid bhi
 In Springfield, Lincoln befriends local shopkeeper Joshua Speed, where he finds a place to stay in the shop as he gets work, and as the night goes on he goes hunting for vampires, and settles his corpses out of the city limits

 haalaanki sterges ne use kisi bhi rishta na jodne kii chetavanee di thi, par abraham kii mairi taad se hui mulaaqaat, donon ek duusare se pyaar kar baithte hai, iske baavjood uski sagaai kisi or stephen e
 duglas se hone par yah baat izhaar nahin kar paati
 During this, Lincoln finds Barthes and kills him until he finds out about Mary
 marane se pehle, barts ek rahasy sterges ke pishaach hone kaa bare main bataata he
 Lincoln soon confronts Sturges, explaining why he became a vampire, that Adam and his wife were attacked and bitten by Adam a century ago
 chunki henry kii bivi kii ruh saaf thi, so is dansh ne uski jaan le lee, lekin sterges kii aatma patit hone ke kaaran vah pishaach ban gaya or adam or duusare pishaach ko nuksaan naa pahunchaa paane kii vajah bataai
 
 sturges ab isi tarah pishaach shikari ke gur sikhta he, is aashaa se ki vah adam ko tabah kar daalega
 After this disappointment, Lincoln makes up his mind to leave the campaign
 iske baavjood, adam apni gatividhiyaan jari rakhata he or janson ko aguva kar bagan taraf linkan ko fansane ke liye jaal bichhaata he
 Adam then captures Lincoln and tries to include him in his group, even conspiring to make the United Nations a dead nation
 speed apane doston ko bachaata he, or ve ohayo bhaag nikalate hai
 Lincoln then marries Mary and begins her political career as an electoral campaign to abolish slavery
 sturges yah aagaah linkan se karata he ki is gulaami kaarobaar kii bagdor unheen pishaach ke haathon hai, joki gulam un pishaachon kii khuraaq he, yadi linkan dakhlandji karata he, to pishaach iskaa badla jarur lenge
 Lincoln eventually becomes President of the United States after winning the election, settling in the White House with Mary and her son, William Wallace Lincoln
 par inhen dauraan wiliam ko vadoma shikaar bana leti he or vah maaraa jaataa he
 At the same time, President Jefferson Davis assures Adam in this conspiracy that he will deploy vampires on the front
 linkan sabhi chaandi ke saamaanon ko jabt karaane kaa aadesh jari karata he taaki inhen pighalaakar hathiyaaron kaa rup de saken
 Speed is convinced that Lincoln will tear the nation apart this time, blaming it and taunting Adam that Lincoln is about to leave on a silver-laden train
 train par, adam or vadoma, apane gantavy par pahunchane se pehle raste main aag laga daalate hai, or linkan, sturges evam janson par dhaava bolte hai
 During the fight, Speed, before dying, tells Adam that there are only stones on the train
 linkan ye khulaasa karata he ki speed ne uske kehane par adam ko yahaan tak chaal main fansaane ke liye dhokhaa main rakhaa
 Lincoln kills Adam, trying to stop Adam with his silver watch, and escapes before the train is destroyed
 is bich, mairi or duusare purv-gulam saare chaandi ko bhumigat railweymarg se getisburg pahunchaa dete hai
 And then vampires, who have become legions of headless Allied nations, massacre and reach the chiefs of the Union to give it the final result
 magar jald hi chaandi ke hathiyaaron se las, union fujen pishaachon ko nestnabud kar daalati he or antat yuddh jeet lete hai
 Two years later, on April 14, 1865, Sturges still tells Lincoln of some vampires fleeing the country
 sturges tab linkan is baat ko raji karne kii koshish karata he ki vah chaahe to linkan ko pishaach banaakar, hameshaa ke liye amar kara saktaa he jisase pishaachon keviruddh ladaai jari rakh sake, magar linkan aisa kuch bhi karne se inkaar kar detaa he
 In the modern era of the present, Sturges invites Lincoln once again as a human to a bar in Washington, DC

 hindu panchang ke anusaar sawan maah kii shukla paksh ke panchami ko naag panchami ke rup main manaaya jaataa he

 Feeding the snake leads to death due to lack of digestion or allergy
 shastron main naagon ko doodh pilaane ko nahin balki doodh se snaan karaane ko kaha gaya he
 On the same day of Nagpanchami, wrestling takes place in many villages and towns in which wrestlers from around the world participate
 gaay, bail aadi pashuon ko is din nadi, talab main le jaakar nahalaaya jaataa he
 Ashtanagas are worshiped on this day
 - Hindu culture has tried to make intimate connections with all animals, birds and plants
 hamaare yahaan gaay kii puja hoti he
 Many sisters observe nightingale
 koyal ke darshan ho athwa uskaa swar kaan par pade tab hi bhojan lenaa, aisa yah vrath he
 The bull is worshiped here on the day of Vrishabhotsav
 vat-savitri jaise vrath main bargad kii puja hoti he, parantu naag panchami jaise din naag kaa pujan jab ham karte hai, tab to hamaari samskruti kii vishistataa parakashta par pahunch jaati he
 We try to cultivate intimacy with them by worshiping cows, bulls, cuckoos, etc
, because they are useful
 lekin naag hamaare kis upyog main aata he, ulte yadi kaate to jaan liye bina na rahe
 We are all afraid of him
 naag ke is dar se nagpuja shuru hui hogi, aisa kai log maanate hai, parantu yah manyata hamaari samskruti se susangat nahin lagati
 We get to see the enormity of the heart of the Aryans in accepting Nag as a god
 'krinvanto vishwamaryam' is garjana ke saath aage badhate hue aaryon ko bhinn-bhinn upasna karte hue anek samoohon ke sampark main aana padaa
 The Aryans had to work very hard to get effective ideas of the Vedas to them
 vibhinn samoohon ko upasna vidhi main rahe fark ke kaaran hone vaale vivaad ko yadi nikaal diya jaae to maanav maatr vedon ke tejasvi or bhavy vichaaron ko sweekaar karegaa, is par aaryon kii akhand shraddha thi
 To make it successful, the Aryans accepted the worship of different gods moving in different arms and they assimilated different elements into their own
 in vibhinn pujaaon ko sweekaar karne ke kaaran hi hamen nagpuja praapt hui hogi, aisa lagata he
 India was and is a farming country
 saanp kheton kaa rakshan karata he, isliye use kshetrapal kehete hai
 The snake keeps our fields green by destroying the animals, rats, etc
 which are the elements that cause crop damage
 saanp hamen kai mook sandesh bhi detaa he
 We should have qualitative and astounding vision to see the qualities of a snake
 bhagwaan dattatraya kii aisi shubh drushti thi, isliye hi unhen prayek vastu se kuch na kuch sikh mili
 Snakes generally do not bite anyone without reason
 use pareshaan karne vaale ko yaa chhedane waalon ko hi vah dansataa he
 The snake is also the surgeon of the Lord, if he goes smoothly without doing harm, or he lives as a non-innocent, then we have no right to kill him
 jab ham uske praan lene kaa praytn karte hai, tab apane praan bachaane ke liye yaa apana jivan tikaane ke liye yadi vah hamen dans de to use dusht kaise kaha ja saktaa he? hamaare praan lene waalon ke praan lene kaa praytn kya ham nahin karte? The snake is very pleasing to the aroma
 champa ke paudhe ko lipatakar vah rahata he yaa to chandan ke vriksh par vah nivas karata he
 He also wanders in the forest of Kevda
 use sugandh priy lagati he, isliye bhartiya samskruti ko vah priy he
 Every human will get the aroma of virtues in life, the feeling of good thoughts, that fragrance should be dear to us
 ham jaanate hai ki saanp bina kaaran kisi ko nahin katata
 He does not want to lose wasted time by just biting someone by accumulating hard work over the years
 ham bhi jivan main kuch tap karenge to usase hamen bhi shakti paidaa hogi
 It is expected that this power should be spent in anger on someone, not in vain to surprise the weak, or in grieving the infirm, in developing our power, in enabling other incapable, in strengthening the weak
 kuch daivi saanpon ke mastishk par mani hoti he
 The gem is priceless
 hamen bhi jivan main amuly vastuon ko mastishk par chadhaanaa chahie
 Great people like Mukutmani of society should be on our mind
 hamen prem se unki palki uthaani chahie or unke vichaaron ke anusaar hamaare jivan kaa nirmaan karne kaa ahernish praytn karnaa chahie
 The spiritual science which is manifested in all disciplines, must have a unique attraction in our life
 aatmavikas main sahaayak na ho, us gyaan ko gyaan kaise kaha ja saktaa he? The snake lives on the bill and consumes solitude mostly
 isliye mumukshu ko jansamooh ko taalna chahie
 An example of a snake is given in this regard
 dev-daanvon dwaara kiye gaye samudr manthan main saadhan rup banakar vasuki naag ne durjanon ke liye bhi prabhu kaary main nimitt banane kaa maarg khulaa kar diya he
 If an evil person also comes on the right path then he can give his great sum in the cultural work and if the weakness continues continuously, such a person will not be too proud for his hospitality
 durjan bhi yadi bhagavad kaary main jud jaae to prabhu bhi usko sweekaar karte hai, is baat kaa samarthan shiv ne saanp ko apane gale main rakhkar or vishnu ne shesh-shayan karke kiya he
 It is our duty to worship him with a thankful intellect, when a snake, who has been exiled due to rains for the benefit of the entire creation, comes to our house as a guest
 is tarah naag panchami kaa utsav shravan maheene main hi rakhkar hamaare rishiyon ne bahut hi auchity dikhaaya he
 It is prohibited to dig the earth for the entire Shravan month especially Nagpanchami
 is din vrath karke sanpon ko kheer khilaai va doodh pilaayaa jaataa he
 Nag Panchami is also celebrated on the fifth day of the Krishna Paksha of Sawan month
 is din safed camel puja main rakhaa jaataa he
 In ancient times one Sethji had seven sons
 saaton ke vivaah ho chuke the
 The wife of the youngest son was sagely and gentle, but he had no brother
 ek din badi bahu ne ghar lipane ko pili mitti laane ke liye sabhi bahuon ko saath chalane ko kaha to sabhi daliya or khurpy lekar mitti khodne lagi
 Then a snake came out there, which the elder daughter-in-law started to kill with the hoof
 yah dekhakar choti bahu ne use rokte hue kaha- 'mat maaro ise? yah bechaara nirparaadh he
 ' yah sunakar badi bahu ne use nahin maaraa tab sarp ek ore ja baitha
 Then the younger daughter-in-law said to her - "we just come back and don't leave here
" yah kahkar vah sabake saath mitti lekar ghar chali gai or vahaan kaamkaaj main fasakar sarp se jo vaada kiya tha use bhul gai
 When she remembered the other day, she reached there with everyone and seeing the snake sitting at that place, said - Hello snake brother! The snake said- 'you have said brother, therefore i leave you, otherwise i would have bothered you because of telling a lie
 vah boli- bhaiya mujhase bhul ho gai, uski kshamaa maangti hum, tab sarp bolaa- acha, tu aaj se meri bahin hui or main tera bhai hua
 Ask for what you want
 vah boli- bhaiya! meraa koi nahin he, acha hua jo tu meraa bhai ban gaya
 After some days, he came to his house keeping the form of a snake and said, 'send my sister
 ' sabane kaha ki 'iske to koi bhai nahin tha, to vah bolaa- main dur ke rishte main iskaa bhai hoon, bachapan main hi baahar chalaa gaya tha
 After convincing her, the people of the house sent Chhoti with her
 usne maarg main bataaya ki 'main vahiin sarp hoon, isliye tu darana nahin or jahaan chalane main kathinaayee ho vahaan meri puch pakad lenaa
 She did as she was told and thus reached her home
 vahaan ke dhan-aishwarya ko dekhakar vah chakit ho gai
 One day the serpent's mother said to him- 'I am going out of work, give cold milk to your brother
 use yah baat dhyaan na rahi or usase garm doodh pilaa diya, jisamen uskaa mukh betarah jal gaya
 Seeing this, the snake's mother was very angry
 parantu sarp ke samajhane par chup ho gai
 Then the serpent said that the sister should now be sent to her house
 tab sarp or uske pita ne use bahut sa sona, chaandi, jawaharaat, vastra-bhushan aadi dekar uske ghar pahunchaa diya
 Seeing so much wealth, the elder daughter-in-law said to Isha - Brother is very rich, you should bring more wealth from him
 sarp ne yah vachan suna to sab vastuen sone kii laakar de deen
 Seeing this, the elder daughter-in-law said- 'the broom to clean them should also be of gold'
 tab sarp ne jhaadoo bhi sone kii laakar rakh di
 The serpent gave the younger daughter-in-law a wonderful necklace of diamonds
 uski prashansa us desh kii rani ne bhi suni or vah raja se boli ki- seth kii choti bahu kaa haar yahan aana chahie
 'the king ordered the minister that he should be present soon with the necklace from him
 The minister went to Sethji and said' Maharaniji will wear the necklace of the younger daughter-in-law, she will give it to me ' sethji ne dar ke kaaran choti bahu se haar mangakar de diya
 The younger daughter-in-law found it very bad, she remembered her snake brother and prayed on coming - brother! The queen has snatched the necklace, you do something that when that necklace is around her neck, it becomes a snake for the time being and when she returns to me it becomes diamonds and beads
 sarp ne thik vaisaa hi kiya
 As soon as the queen wore the necklace, it became a snake
 yah dekhakar rani cheekh padi or rone lagi
 Seeing this, the king sent news to Seth to send the younger daughter-in-law immediately
 sethji dar gaye ki raja na jane kya karegaa? ve swayan choti bahu ko saath lekar upasthit hue
 The king asked the younger daughter-in-law what magic you have done, i will punish you
 choti bahu boli- rajan ! dhristataa kshamaa kiijie, yah haar hi aisa he ki mere gale main hiron or maniyon kaa rahata he or duusare ke gale main sarp ban jaataa he
 Hearing this, the king turned the snake and gave it to him and said - now show it while wearing it
 choti bahu ne jaise hi use pahana vaise hi hiron-maniyon kaa ho gaya
 Seeing this, the king was convinced of his words and pleased him and gave him many currencies as well
 choti vah apane haar or in sahit ghar laut ai
 Seeing her wealth, the elder daughter-in-law taught her husband that the younger daughter-in-law came from somewhere because of jealousy
 yah sunakar uske pati ne apni patni ko bulaakar kaha- thik-thik bataa ki yah dhan tuje koun detaa he? tab vah sarp ko yaad karne lagi
 At that time, the snake appeared and said - If my religion doubts the conduct of the sister, then i will eat it
 yah sunakar choti bahu kaa pati bahut prasann hua or usne sarp devtaa kaa bada satkar kiya
 From the same day, the festival of Nagpanchami is celebrated and women worship the serpent as their brother
 ek varsh yaa saal surya kii chaaron ore apni kaksha main chalati prithvi kii kakshiya avadhi he
 Due to the Earth's axial tilt, a one-year course observes the passing of seasons, and is characterized by changes in weather, in the hours of insolation, and as a result, by changes in vegetation and soil fertility

 Linguistics scholars are called 'philologists'
 bhashavigyaan, vyakaran se bhinn he
 Functional study of a language is done in grammar while the linguist goes on to do a very comprehensive study of the language
 adhyayan ke anek vishyon main se aajkal bhashaa-vigyaan ko vishesh mahatva diya ja rahaa he
 This language-related study has been named in Europe with many names and nouns till date
 sarvapratham is adhyayan ko philology shabd ke aage visheshan ke rup main ek shabd joda gaya- tab ise ‘‘comparative philology’’ kah kar pukaara gaya
 Until the nineteenth century, grammar and linguistic studies were often considered to be the same
 atah ise vidwaanon ne 'comparative grammer' naam bhi diya
 In France it was named Langistić
 france main bhashaa sambandhi kaary adhik hone ke kaaran unnisvin sadi main sampoorn europe main hi "linguistique" athwa "linguistics" naam hi prachlit rahaa he
 Apart from this, other names like 'science of Language', 'glutology' etc
 also came in handy to reveal this subject
 aaj in sabhi naamon main se ‘‘linguisticks’’, ‘‘philology’’ maatr hi prayog main laae jate hai
 In addition to all these European names in India, the names which are used in Hindi language are as follows - "bhasha-shastra", "bhasha-tattva", "bhasha-sasti", and "" Comparative linguistics "etc
 in sabhi naamon main se sarv prachlit naam ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ he
 All the names, ancient and new, appear to be synonymous in these names
 atah yahi naam is shaastra ke liye sarvatha upyukt prathit hota he
 In its present form, linguistics is said to be the brain of Western scholars
 ati pracheen kaal se hi bhashaa-sambandhi adhyayan kii pravriti sanskrit-sahitya main pai jaati he
 a subtle discussion on language is available in Vedang called 'shiksha'
 dhvaniyon ke uccharan- avyav, sthaan, praytn aadi kaa in granthon main vistrut varnan uplabdh he
 Scientific analysis can be called scientific study of the language on the subjects' etymology, metal, prefix-suffixes etc
 in 'pratishyakhya' and Nirukta
 bhartruhari ke granth ‘vaakya padiya’ ke antargat ‘shabd’ ke swaroop kaa sookshm, gahan evam vyapak chintan uplabdh hota he
 There the word is envisaged as 'brahman' and its 'letter' is described as a noun
 prakaaraantar se yah ek bhashaa-adhyayan sambandhi granth hi he
 In Sanskrit literature, even in philosophical and literary texts, we get indications of language scientific discussions only under the subtle interpretation of the words' meaning ',' rasa ',' bhava ',' language available here and there in Sanskrit literature
 -conceptual material can certainly be called the cornerstone of current linguistics
 aadhunik vishay ke rup main bhashaa-vigyaan kaa sutarapaat europe main san 1786 i0 main sar wiliam jones naamak vidwaan dwaara kiya gaya mana jaataa he
 In the context of the study of Sanskrit language, Sir William Jones had first done a comparative study of Sanskrit, Greek and Latin language and expressed the possibility that at least one of the languages forms the basis of these three languages
 atah in teenon bhashaaon ke bich ek sookshm sambandh sutara avashya vidyaman he
 This type of comparative study of languages became the first step in the field of modern linguistics
 ‘‘bhashaa-vigyaan’’ naam main do padon kaa prayog hua he
 "language" and "science"
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko samajhane se purv in donon shabdon se parichit hona aavashyak prathit hota he
 The word 'bhasha' is derived from the Sanskrit "bhash" metal
 jiskaa arth he-vyakt vaak 
 The word 'science' is formed by applying the prefix 'v' and 'lute' from the 'known' metal
 saamaanya rup se ‘bhashaa’ kaa arth he ‘bol chaal kii bhashaa yaa boli’ tathaa ‘vigyaan’ kaa arth he ‘vishesh gyaan’, kintu ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ shabd main prayukt in donon padon kaa spasht or vyapak arth samaj lene par hi ham is naam kii sargarbhitako jaanane main safal honge
 So, here we try to explain the broad meaning of both these terms
 bhashahmanav ek saamaajik praani he
 The need to convey our feelings and thoughts to each other in the society has been felt since time immemorial
 is prakaar bhashaa kaa astitva maanav samaaj main ati pracheen siddh hota he
 Language serves as an important tool for publishing the entire knowledge of human beings, to know the history of civilization and culture
 hamaare purvapurushon se sabhi saadhaaran or asaadhaaran anubhav ham bhashaa ke madhyam se hi jaan sake hai
 Knowledge from all our scriptures and scriptures is dependent on language
 mahakavi dandi ne apane mahaan granth ‘kavyadarsh’ main bhashaa kii mahatta suchit karte hue likhaa haih- That is, this entire Bhuvan would have become dark, if the word-form light in the world was not the light of language
 spasht hi he ki yah kathan maanav bhashaa ko lakshya karke hi kaha gaya he
 The sounds that animals and birds take shelter to express their expressions may be language for them, but due to being ambiguous to humans, scholars have called it 'latent speech', which is language- Nothing matters from the point of view of science
 kyonki ‘avyakt vaak’ main shabd or arth donon hi aspasht bane rahete hai
 Humans also sometimes use signs of limbs, fidgeting, hand-to-feet, face etc
 to express their feelings, but in spite of being a language, it is not 'express speech'
 maanav bhashaa kii sabase badi visheshta yah hoti he ki vah ‘vyakt vaak’ arthath shabd or arth kii spashtataa liye hue hoti he
 According to Patanjali, the author of Mahabhashya, 'express speech' refers to the descriptive language
 yah satya he ki kabhi-kabhi sanketon or angabhangimaaon kii sahaayta se bhi hamaare bhav or vichaaron kaa preshan badi saralata se ho jaataa he
 In this way, those gestures become symbols of language, but the most appropriate means of expressing human emotion is the descriptive language which has been given the noun of 'express speech'
 is main vibhinn arthon ko prakat karne ke liye kuch nischit uccharit yaa kathith dhvaniyon kaa aashray liya jaataa he
 Therefore, language is called a group of words which are filled with signs of different meanings
 jinke dwaara ham apane manobhaav saralata se dusron ke prati prakat kar sakate hai
 Thus, while defining the language, we can call it a medium adopted to exchange thoughts and expressions in human society, which holds the meaningful basis for the sounds that have been effortlessly ejected from the utterances of humans
 wo dhwani-samooh shabd kaa rup tab lete hai jab ve kisi arth se jud jate hai
 Entire phonology is based on a 'random' relationship with its meaning
 ‘yadrichhik’ kaa arth he purnataya kalpit
 In short, we call that word group pronounced with different meanings expressed in different meanings through which we convey our feelings and thoughts to others
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke adhyayan se hamen anek laabh hote hai, jaise- 1
 Satisfaction of curiosity or elimination of doubts about your familiar language
 2

 bhashaa, lipi aadi main saralata, shuddhta aadi kii drushti se parivartan-parivardhan main sahaayta
 In view of all these benefits, linguistics is considered to be a very useful subject in today's age and its field of study is constantly developing
 bhashaa ek prakritik vastu he jo maanav ko ishwariya vardaan ke rup main mili hui he
 Language is formed by naturally sounding sounds from the mouth of man
 bhashaa kaa saamaanya gyaan iske bolne or sunne vaale sabhi ko ho jaataa he
 This is called general knowledge of language
 iske aage, bhashaa kab bani, kaise bani ? iskaa praarambhik evam pracheen swaroop kya tha ? isamen kab-kab, kya-kya parivartan hue or un parivartanon ke kya kaaran hai ? athwa kul milakar bhashaa kaise viksit hui ? us vikaas ke kya kaaran hai ? koun si bhashaa kis duusari bhashaa se kitni samanta yaa vishmata rakhti he ? yah sab bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan yaa ‘bhashaa-vigyaan’ kaha jayega
 This particular form of linguistics, ie linguistics, has been considered as an important subject of study today
 bhashaa-vigyaan jab adhyayan ke vishyon main badi-badi kakshaon ke paathyakramon ke antargat sammilit kiya gaya to sarvapratham yah ek swaabhaavik prashn utpann hua ki bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala ke antargat gina jaae yaa vigyaan main
 That is, linguistics is art or science
 adhyayan kii prakriya evam nishkarshon ko lekar nishchay kiya jane laga ki vastutah use bhautik vigyaan, evam rasayan vigyaan aadi kii bhanti vishuddh vigyaan mana jaae athwa chitra, sangeet, murti, kavy aadi kalaon kii bhanti kala ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaae
 Art is related to human beings objects or subjects
 yahi kaaran he ki kala vyakti pradhan yaa purnatah vaiyaktik hoti he
 Apart from being relative, a particular country and period also have an influence on art
 iskaa abhipraay yah he ki kisi kaal main kala ke prati jo mulya rahete hai unamem kaalaantar main naye-naye parivartan upasthit ho jate hai tathaa ve kisi duusare desh main bhi maan liye jaaen, yah bhi aavashyak nahin he
 a person is feeling high artistic expression in an object
 kintu duusare ko vah is prakaar kii na lag rahi ho
 Therefore, the perception of art varies from person to person
 kala kaa sambandh maanav hriday kii ragatmik vritti se hota he
 There is a mixture of aesthetics of the person in it
 kala kaa uddeshy bhi soundaryanubhuti karana, yaa anand pradaan karnaa he, kisi vastu kaa tathvik vishleshan karnaa nahin
 The test of all these characteristics of the nature of art shows that linguistics is not art
 kyonki uskaa sambandh hriday kii sarasata-vritti se na hokar buddhi kii tatvagrahi drushti se hota he
 The aim of linguistics is not to provide beauty or entertainment
 vah to hamaare bauddhik chintan ko prakhar banaata he
 Elemental assessment of the existence of language
 uskaa drushtikon buddhivaadee he
 The findings of linguistics do not change on the basis of any person, nation or period and the basic basis of the study of linguistics, which is language, is not a humanized substance
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan ko ham kala ke kshetra main nahin gin sakate
 The usefulness of linguistics is that it teaches the art of language teaching
 isi kaaran sweet ne vyakaran ko bhashaa ko kala tathaa vigyaan donon kaha he
 Pure pronunciation, effective use of language can be placed in the category of art
 bhashaa-vigyaan ko kala kii seemaa main nahin rakhaa ja saktaa, yah nishchay ho jane par yah prashn uthta he ki kya bhashaa-vigyaan, bhautik-shaastra, rasayan-vigyaan aadi vishyon kii bhanti purnatah vigyaan he ? In the belief of many scholars, linguistics is not a pure science
 unki dharna ke anusaar abhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke sabhi prayog purnataa ko praapt nahin hue hai or uske nishkarshon ko isiilie antim nishkarsh nahin kaha ja saktaa
 At the same time, not all conclusions of linguistics are as universal and eternal as science
 jis prakaar ganit shaastra main 2 + 2 = 4 saarvkalik, vikalparahit nishkarsh he jo sarvatra sweekaar kiya jaataa he, bhashaa-vigyaan ke paas is prakaar ke vikalp-rahit nirvivaad nishkarsh nahin he
 In science, facts are compiled and analyzed, and the laws of sound are mostly non-committal, so according to some scholars, linguistics can be placed between humanities and science
 vichaar karne par ham dekhte hai ki vigyaan kii aaj kii durat pragati main prayek vishesh gyaan apane aagaamee gyaan ke saamne purana or avaigyanik siddh hota ja rahaa he
 In today's era of continual innovators, the scientific view is constantly going from micro to micro and new to new
 aaj ke viksit gyaan-kshetra ko dekhte hue kai vaigyanik manyataayen puraani or feeki pad gai he
 Newton's theory of light is also now being viewed with suspicion
 isse yah siddh hota ho jaataa he ki nutan gyaan ke prakaash main puraatan gyaan bhi vigyaan ke kshetra se baahar kar diya jaataa he
 Therefore, considering it from the point of view of pure knowledge, we find linguistics within the range of science itself
 bhashaa-vigyaan nishchay hi ek vigyaan he jiske antargat ham bhashaa kaa vishesh gyaan praapt karte hai
 It is true that linguistics has not yet been fully developed on a scientific level
 yahi kaaran he ki prasiddh grim-niyam ke aage chal kar grassmaan or varnor ko usamen sudhaar karnaa padaa he
 Prior to the above reforms, the sound rule of Grimm was considered to be the definite rule and even after the reforms it is considered to be the definite rule
 is prakaar naye gyaan ke prakaash main puraane siddhanton kaa khandan hone se vigyaan kaa koi virodh nahin he
 Actually this is pure science
 san 1930 ke baad jahaan varnanaatmak bhashaa-vigyaan ko punah mahatva praapt hua, vahaan tab se lekar aaj tak drut gati main vikaas hua he
 Ever since new tests have started with the help of instruments in the field of sound and the conclusions obtained have started to be completely regular, since then linguistics has gradually started to be considered in the category of science
 vigyaan kii ek badi visheshta he uskaa prayogtmak hona
 After American scholar Baloom Field, American linguists have developed experimental linguistics with great intensity as a new method of linguistics with phonology and morphology etc
 is paddati ke antargat bhashaa-vigyaan prayogshaalaon kaa vishay banataa ja rahaa he or uske liye anek yantron kaa avishkaar ho gaya he
 Seeing this, this subject will definitely be called science, there is no doubt in it at all
 aajkal jabaki samaaj-vigyaan, manovigyaan aadi shastreey vishyon ke liye jahaan vigyaan shabd kaa prayog karne kii parampara chal padi he tab shuddh kaaran-kaary parampara par aadhaarit bhashaa-vigyaan ko vigyaan kahana kisi bhi drushti se anuchit nahin tehraaya ja saktaa
 Dr
 Shyamsunder Das has written in his book Language Secret- mangal dev shastri ke shabdon main- This definition is given in Dr
 Bholanath Tiwari's 'linguistics' text as follows- upar di gai sabhi paribhaashaon par vichaar karne se gyaat hota he ki unamem paraspar koi antar nahin he
 In the definition of Dr
 Shyamsunder Das, where the focus has been on linguistics only, Mangaldev Shastri and Bholanath Tiwari have included the types of study of linguistics in their definitions
 paribhaasha vah acchhee hoti he jo sankshipt ho or spasht ho
 Thus, we can give a new definition of linguistics in this way - "the study by which the study of human languages is subtle and analytical is called linguistics
" ” In other words, linguistics is that in which subtle and extensive scientific study of human languages is done
 bhashaa ke prachlit vartmaan swaroop ko chhod kar shesh sari adhyayan saamagree bhashaa-vigyaan ko sahitya se hi uplabdh hoti he
 If Sanskrit, Greek and Avesta literature were not in front of us today, linguistics would never have been successful in knowing that these three languages originated from any one native language
 isi prakaar adikaal se lekar aadhunik kaal tak kaa hindi sahitya hamaare saamne na hota to bhashaa-vigyaan hindi bhashaa ke aitihaasik vikaas kaa adhyayan kis prakaar kar paata
 Linguistics to study language in any way, he has to take help of literature on foot
 bundelkhand ke natkhat baalkon ke munh se yah sun kar- The grammar says what a problem this is, only the study of ancient literature will tell him that this is the impaired form of the first sutra of Shaktayan, 'un Namah Siddham'
 sahitya bhi bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se apni anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan khojane main safal ho jaataa he
 Dr
 Vasudev Sharan Aggarwal has clarified their meanings by linking many words of 'padmavat' with their original forms, validated on the basis of linguistic principles
 saath hi shuddh paath ke nirdhaaran main bhi isse paryaapt sahaayta lee he
 Hence, both literature and linguistics are supportive of each other
 bhashaa hamaare bhaavon-vichaaron arthath man kaa pratibimb hoti he atah bhashaa kii sahaayta se bahut se samasyaon ko suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Economics in particular is completely based on psychology
 vaakya-vigyaan ke adhyayan main bhi manovigyaan se paryaapt sahaayta milti he
 Sometimes psychology also helps us to know the cause of sound changes
 bhashaa kii utpatti tathaa praarambhik rup kii jaankaree main bhi bal-manovigyaan tathaa aviksit logon kaa manovigyaan hamaari sahaayta karata he
 Psychology also has to seek help from linguistics in its medical practice to know the meaning of the patient
 atah bhashaa-vigyaan kii sahaayta se ek manovigyaani rogi kii manogranthiyon kaa pataa lagane main safal ho saktaa he
 Due to the close relationship between linguistics and psychology, a new study method is being developed nowadays called Language Psychology or Psycholinguistics
 bhashaa mukh se nikalne vaali dhwani ko kehete hai atah bhashaa-vigyaan main hawa bheetar se kaise chalati he, swaryantr, swartantri, nasikavivar, kauwa, taalu, daant, jeebh, onth, kanth, moorddha tathaa naak ke kaaran usamen kya parivartan hote hai tathaa kaan dwaara kaise dhwani grahan kii jaati he, in sabakaa adhyayan karnaa padataa he
 Physiology only helps him in this
 likhit bhashaa kaa grahan aankh dwaara hota he or is prakriya kaa adhyayan bhi bhashaa-vigyaan ke antargat hi hota he
 For this also he has to be indebted to physiology
 bhashaa-vigyaan or bhugol kaa bhi-gaharaa sambandh he
 According to some people, the geographical conditions of a place have a profound influence on its language
 kisi sthaan main boli jane vaali bhashaa main vahaan ke ped-paudhe, pakshi, jeev-jantu evam ann aadi ke liye shabd avashya milte hai parantu yadi unamem se kisi kii samaapti ho jaae to uskaa naam vahaan kii bhashaa se bhi juda ho jaataa hai
 The word 'somlata' is not used in our language today
 is lop kaa kaaran sambhavtah bhugolic hi he
 Geographic conditions are also the result of lack of a language spread in a place, less development in language and many dialects in a place
 durgam parvaton par rahane vaali jatiyon kaa paraspar kam sampark hone ke kaaran unki boli prasar nahin kar paati
 The dialect of people living across rivers differs from the common language
 deshon, nagaron, nadiyon tathaa praanton aadi ke naamon kaa bhashaa-vaigyanik adhyayan karne main bhugol badi manoranjak saamagree pradaan karata he
 Even in the field of economics, geography helps linguistics
 ‘ushtr’ kaa arth bhainsa se oont kaise ho gaya tathaa ‘saindhav’ kaa arth ghoda or namak hi kyon hua, aadi samasyaon par vichaar karne main bhi bhugol sahaayta karata he
 language-geography, a branch of linguistics, is just like geography
 isi prakaar kisi sthaan ke pragautihaasik kaal ke bhugol kaa adhyayan karne main bhashaa-vigyaan bhi paryaapt sahaayak hota he
 History is also closely related to linguistics
 itihaas ke teen roopon raajnneetik itihaas, dharmik itihaas, saamaajik itihaas-ko lekar yahan bhashaa-vigyaan se uskaa sambandh dikhalaayaa ja rahaa he- Other areas of knowledge like logic, physics and anthropology also provide great help in the study of linguistics
 manushya main anek prakaar ke andhvishwaas ghar kar lete hai jinka uski bhashaa par prabhaav padataa he
 In Indian society, women take their husbands' names in a twisted way, not outright
 raatri main vishaal keedon kaa naam nahin liya jaataa he
 They name their boy Mange, Chedi, Bechu, Ghurahu, Katwaru Alichar or Lendha, etc
 andhvishwaason ke atirikt anya bahut si saamaajik-manovigyaan se sambaddh gutthiyon ke spashtikaran ke liye maanav-vigyaan kii shakha-prashakhaon kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he
 In this way, many fields of knowledge- culture-studies, pedagogy, statistics, text-science, etc
 have a deep connection with linguistics
 maanav kii bhashaa kaa jo kshetra he vahi bhashaa-vigyaan kaa kshetra he
 The languages and dialects of civilized and uncivilized humans around the world are studied under linguistics
 is prakaar bhashaa-vigyaan keval sabhy-saahitiyik bhashaaon kaa hi adhyayan nahin karata apitu asabhy-barbar-asaahitiyik boliyon kaa, jo prachlan main nahin he, ateet ke garv main khoi hui hai un bhashaaon kaa bhi adhyayan iske antargat hota he
 Linguistics is divided into language structure and 'study of meaning' from the point of view of subject division
 isamen bhashaa kaa vaigyanik drushtikon se vishleshan or varnan karne ke saath hi vibhinn bhashaaon ke bich tulanaatmak adhyayan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Linguistics has two sides - elemental and applied
 iske atirikt bhashavigyaan kaa gyaan-vigyaan kii anyaanya shakhaon ke saath gaharaa sambandh he
 This has led to the development of various branches of sociolinguistics, psychodynamics, academic linguistics, etc
 bhashavigyaan ke gaun kshetra nimnlikhit hai- Syntax: In language, all thought-exchange is done on the basis of sentences
 bhashaa-vigyaan ke jis vibhaag main is par vichaar kiya jaataa he use vaakya-vichaar yaa vaakya-vigyaan kehete hai
 It has three forms - vaakya-rachana kaa sambandh bolanewaale samaaj ke manovigyaan se hota he
 Therefore this branch of linguistics is very difficult
 rup-vigyaan : vaakya kii rachana padon yaa roopon ke aadhaar par hoti he
 Therefore, the idea of verse or form becomes important after a sentence
 rup-vigyaan ke antargat dhaatu, upsarg, pratyay aadi un sabhi upkarnon par vichaar karnaa padataa he jinase rup banate hai
 Phonology: The base word of form or verse
 shabdon par rachana yaa itihaas in do drushtiyon se vichaar kiya ja saktaa he
 The idea of a person or language is also done under it
 kosh-nirmaan tathaa vyutpatti-shaastra shabd-vigyaan ke hi vichaar-kshetra kii seemaa main aate hai
 The cultural history of the speaker can be known on the basis of the word group of the language
 dhwani-vigyaan : shabd kaa aadhaar he dhwani
 Sounds are studied in many ways under phonology
 iske antargat dhwani-shaastra ek alag se upavibhag he jisamen dhwani utpann karne vaale angon-mukh-vivar, nasika-vivar, swar tantri, dhwani yantra ke saath-saath sunne kii prakriya kaa bhi adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 There are two forms of this study - historical and second comparative
