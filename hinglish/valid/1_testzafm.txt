 ye sant namdev ke samakaleen the or unke saath inhone puure maharashtra kaa bhraman kar logon ko gyaan-bhakthi se parichit karaayaa or samta, sambhaav kaa upadesh diya
 They are also considered among the 'proto-promoters' of Maharashtra culture

 After marriage, he took renunciation initiation, but he had to enter the householder's labor again with the permission of his Gurudev
 is avasthaa main unhen nivrittinath, gyandev tathaa sopan naamak teen putr evam muktabai naam kii ek kanya hui
 Due to the birth of these children after renunciation, initiation, they had to endure this derogatory address 'children of ascetics'
 vitthal pant ko to us samay ke samaaj dwaara di gai ajna ke anusaar dehtyag tak karnaa padaa tha
 The orphaned brothers and sisters, who were deprived of the umbrella of their father, went to the well-known Dharmakshetra reading of that time to receive the 'shuddhipatra', under the harsh trauma of Janapism
 kimvadanti prasiddh he : gyandev ne yahan unka uphaas uda rahe brahmanon ke samaksh bhainse ke mukh se vedoccharan karaayaa tha
 According to his biography published by Geetapress, Gorakhpur - " xxrep 5

 With the said Corrigendum, all four reached the village of Nevasse, situated on the banks of the river Pravara

 He conveyed that spiritual heritage to his younger sister Muktabai through Jnanadev

 The name of this is Bhavarthadeepika or Dnyaneshwari

 Some scholars are of the opinion - He also wrote a Marathi commentary on the Abhinav circle, but Yogavasistha, but unfortunately it is inaccessible

 After the completion of this book, these four brothers and sisters reached the nearby village of Alandi in Pune
 yahan se inhone yogiraj changdev ko 65 oviyon main jo patr likhaa vah maharashtra main 'changdev pasashthi' naam se vikhyath he
 When Gyanadev left Alandi for the purpose of pilgrimage, he was accompanied by his brothers, sisters, grandmother, and many contemporary saints like Visova Khecher, Gora Kumhar etc
 visheshtya namdev tathaa gyandev ke aapasi sambandh itane snehpurn the ki aisa lagata tha maano is tirthayatra ke bahaane gyaan or karm donon tapasviyon ke bhes main saakaar rup dhaaran kar ekarup ho gaye hon
 Returning from the pilgrimage, Gyan Dev reached Alandi by Pandharpur route
 vidwaanon kaa anumaan hai ki gyandev ne isi kaal main apane 'abhangon' kii rachana kii hogi
 After re-establishing the bhagavata-dharma by introducing the Bhakti Marg from the child to the elderly, Gyan Dev decided to take a living samadhi in Alandi village, despite being very young
 maatr 21 varsh teen maah or paanch din kii alpaayu main vah is nashwar sansar kaa parityag kar samadhisth ho gayi
 Saint Namdev has written the account of Gyandev's tomb
 apane guru nivrittinath ko antim vandan kar gyandev sthitprajna ke samaan samadhimandir main ja baithe
 Thereafter, the Guru himself closed the gateway to the Samadhimandir
 gyaneshwar, jinhen dhyaneshwar bhi kaha jaataa he, ne yah jivit samadhi gram aalindi samvath main shake 1217 kii margshirsh vadi triyodashi ko lee, jo pune ke lagbhag 14 kilometre dur ab ek prasiddh tirth ban gaya he
 Many works like 'dnyaneshwari', 'amritanubhav', 'changdev Pasathi' and 'abhang' written by Dnyaneshwar are well accepted
 kuch varsh purv yah siddhant upasthit kiya gaya tha ki gyaneshwari ke lekhak tathaa abhang ke rachayita, ek hi naam ke do bhinn vyakti hai
 But now it has been accepted by refuting this principle from many firm grounds that these creations are only of the person Saint Dnyaneshwar / Dhyaneshwar
 apane abhangon main gyaneshwar ne tatvacharchaa kii gaharaaiyon ko na napate hue adhikaar vaani se saadhaaran janata ko achardharm kii shiksha di he
 The result was that this disregard was completely reflected in the minds of children from old to old
 gurukrupa, namsmaran or satsang ye parmarthpath kii teen seedhiyaan hai, jinka digdarshan sant gyaneshwar ne apni shikshaaon main multah karaayaa he
 Jnanadev was a great saint likewise he was also a great poet
 unki aadhyatmik sadhana kavyras se aplavit he, unki kavita ko darshan kii guru-gambhirtha mili he
 It is true that due to the disguise of Dnyaneshwar being like 'you-past', there have been visions of rasa-sources in it, however, his knowledge has been completed in Dnyaneshwari itself
 kavy ke donon angon, ras or alankaar kaa gyaneshwari main sundar samanvay he
 Like Dyanvichar and Kavyasoundarya, all the works that Dnyaneshwar did in the traditional life of Maharashtra were revolutionary
 un dinon karmkand kaa bolbalaa tha, samaaj kaa netritv karanevaali panditon kii parampara prabhaavaheen ho chuki thi
 In such a state, while establishing the importance of spiritual knowledge, Gyandev gave the assessment of devotional path of the common man
 panditon ke granthon tak simit rahanevaala aadhyatm darshan shudradikon ke liye bhi sahaj sulabh ho, ise dhyaan main rakhte hue' gyaneshwari' kii rachana kii gai
 Due to being born in a clan considered 'low', no matter how 'low' a person is considered socially, but God gives equal shelter to everyone, the credit for rendering this theory is to Dnyaneshwar
 maharashtra main inke granth gyaneshwari ko 'mouli' yaa mata bhi kaha jaataa he
 Due to the second sermon and assurance, at that time only a generation of Bhagavadhaktas were created in all the castes of Maharashtra and Marathi sentimental male and female started singing the glory of Lord Pandurang or Vitthal of Pandharpur in their own language
 bhagavan keval kathor nyaayadhish hi nahin, apitu sahajvatsal pita bhi hai
 He has compassion for a mother in his eyes - Dnyaneshwar told this in his simple-sweet language all over Maharashtra
 isi kaaran yahan punah ek baar bhagwat dharm kii sthapana hui tathaa is sampradaay ke pramukh dharmagranth ke rup main 'gyaneshwari' kii bhi samaanyajan ke bich pratishtha hui
 Due to this, many Bhagwat poets composed books in Marathi language and created a rich poetry tradition on the path of devotion, which is why Jnanadev became the proto-promoter of Maharashtra culture

 Nepal used to be huge during the ancient Khaskal and Kirant period and Sima used to be Kamaru in the east, Kamaksha, Katur in the south and Kangra in the west and the truth of this can be known from chapter 81 of Skanda Purana
 skanda puraana ke is adhyay main spasht ullekh he ki nepal ki simaayein kahan se kahan tak thim
 The fact that the truth can be traced back to the Atharvaveda even 1000 years ago and this is confirmed in Kautilya's Arthashastra also

 kiraant kaal kaa ant or lichchhaviyon kaa nepal main shashan shuru hona nepal ke liye ek durbhaagya tha
 At the end of the reign of the Lichchhavis, they became so powerful that Nepal was divided into 53 pieces
 lichchhaviyon ke baad mall vansh kaa shashan aayaa par wo bhi nepal kaa ekikaran karne main naakaam rahen
 The rule of the Malla dynasty was followed by the rise of the Shah dynasty in Nepal
 shah vansh ke kaal ko nepal ke aadhunik yug ki shuruyaat bhi kehete hai
 Divided into 53 pieces, there was a fragment in Nepal itself which was known as Gorkha dominion
 gorkha ke raja thea prithvinarayan shah
 Prithvinarayan Shah decided to reunite Nepal divided into 53 pieces and started a campaign of Nepal integration
 vikram samvat 1799 main prithvinarayan shah gorkha ke raja bane us ke ek saal baad hi padosi rajya nuvakot par prithvinarayan shah ne hamalaa bol diya or vijay hasil ki or isi ke saath ekikaran kaa abhiyaan shuru kar diya
 He later conquered the Sena kingdom of Makwanpur in Vikram Samvat 1819 and succeeded in assimilating it into his kingdom, and excitedly attacked Kirtipur in 1823 and also set the victory flag on Kirtipur
 isi ke saath vikram samvat 1825 main lagaataar kantipur, lalitpur tathaa 1826 main bhaktpur ko apane adhikaar main lekar teenon rajyon ko jod kar kathmandu upatyaka banaaya or kathmanduko apni rajdhani banaaya
 After that Prithvinarayan Shah turned his attention to Nepal integration and conquered Chaudandi in Vikram Samvat 1830
 agle varsh vijaipur rajyako ekikaran kar purv taraf kii sima ko mechi ke aas-paas pahunchaaya
 After the death of Prithvinarayan Shah, his elder son Pratap Singh Shah included Chittavan in Nepal, but due to his death soon, the minor queen Bahadur Shah became the king of Nepal
 naebi ke rup main rajmata rajendralakshmi ne shashan kaa door apane haathon main lekar sasur ke ekikaran abhiyaan ko nirantarataa diya
 Vikram Samvat included Lamjung, Tanhu and Kashki in twenty-four states from 1834 to 1842

 He then concentrated on the west side and took possession of the twenty-four states by 1844
 bahadoor shah ne bise rajyon par bhi akraman kiya or karnali pradesh ke rajyon ko jitate hue jumlaa ko apane adhin main kar lene ke baad 1847 main doti rajya par vijay hasil kar nepal kaa pashchimi sima mahakali nadi tak pahunchaaya
 In the same year he attacked Almora, the capital of Kumau and also conquered Kumau
 duusare varsh unhonen gadhwal ki rajdhani srinagar par hamalaa kar ise ashrith rajya banaaya, lekin tibet ke saath hue yuddh ke kaaran yah ekikaran rokna pad
 After the death of Bahadur Shahk, this campaign proceeded under the leadership of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa and General Amar Singh Thapa
 vikram samvat 1861 main srinagar par punah akraman kiya gaya or gadhwal ko purn rup se nepal main sammilit kar liya gaya
 In this way, the western Sima of Nepalak reached the Yamuna River, immediately after that the Nepalese army crossed the Yamuna River and integrated all the 12 small and small kingdoms running between the Yamuna River and the Sutlej River under the name of Thakurai
 vikram samvat 1863 main amar singh thapa ne satluj paar kar vibhinn rajyon ko jitate hue kangra shahar par akraman kiya lekin raavi nadi tak pahunch chuke nepali sena kangra kila ko jit nahin paaya
 In the course of unification, the Nepali army kept King Sansar Chand of Kangra in a siege of Kangra Fort for four years
 baad main sansarchand ke sahaayta ke liye punjab ke raja ranjit singh aae jinke saath nepali sena ne yuddh kiya jis ke falswarup jwalamukhi sandhi kiya gaya or is sandhi ke anusaar nepali sena satluj nadi ke us taraf hat jane ke liye baadhya ho gayi
 In this way the vast Nepal was reunified and the easternmost Sima of Nepal extended to the Tishta River and the western Sima to the Sutlej River
 1 navambar 1814 ko east india compani k taraf se general hestigs ne nepal viruddh vidhivat rup main yuddh ki ghoshnaa kar di
 Amar Singh Thapa had the burden of defense of the far west side in the five-front fronts of the nepal-british bitch and he was handling the war front from this place
 satluj sima ki ore se nepal main akraman karne ke liye karyrat angrej general octor loni ne amar singh thapa ko vibhinn prakaar ke pralobhan die or apane saath milaane ki lakh koshish ki, lekin amar singh thapa angrejon ke pralobhan main nahin phase or vah virtapurvak ladate hue kila ki suraksha karte rahen
 When the British could not control the Sutlej in this way, the British entered the Nepalese land by another war route
 angrej jab satluj par kaabo na kar sake to baad main duusare raste se hokar nalapani ke taraf badhen
 The battle front of Nalapani Fort was on the Balbhadra Kunar
 san 1814 octubar se navambar tak hue bhishan nalapani yuddh main general jilespie sahit 1000 angrej sena maare gaye thea
 Finally, when the Nepalese army could not be defeated with Nepalese war skills, the British cut off the supply of drinking water coming to the fort
 kai dinon tak jab pani pine ko nahin mil paaya to baadhya hokar balbhadra kuker bache hue apane 70 jane yoddhaon sahit nange khukuri ko nachaate hue jab kila se baahar nikle to angrej log chakit ho gayi thea
 After the Nalapani war, a second decisive battle took place at the Deothal Fort in Malone
 angrejon ne apni sampurn shakti lagaai thi is kile ko hathiyaane main or ve safal ho gayi baad main 70 varsh kaat chuke vir yodgha bhakthi thapa pun: is kile ko waapas lene ke liye angrejon se bhid gayi lekin angrejon ke top se nikle aag ke golon ko apni chaati pe khate hue wo vahiin shahid ho gayi
 In this way, Nepal won on five front fronts of Nepal and the British won on two fronts
 angrejon ke usee jeet ne nepal ko sugauli sandhi jaise asmaan sandhi par hastakshar karne ke liye majaboor kar diya
 The dispute between the british-east India Company and Nepal arose in the cycle of unification of small states on the border of British India
 jab nepal ne gadhwal or kumaun kaa ekikaran kar liya vahaan kaa shaasha british-east india ke sharan main sahaayta maangne chalaa gaya vaise hi sikkim ke raja ne bhi british-east india se sahaayta maangi thi
 Here the people of Saran district had also complained to the British East India Company about Nepal, as a result, the British declared war against Nepal
 british-east india or nepal sarkaar ke bich yuddh 1814 se 1816 tak chali
 The war took place on 5 fronts, in which Nepal won on 3 fronts and the british-east India Company won on 2 fronts

 shaiwal or kavak sadrush nimna shrenee ke paudhon main samagam se janan hota he or ucch shrenee kii vanaspatiyon main nishechan se
 Plants whose gametes do not have a differentiation of male and female are called homozygous and such plants are homozygous
 nishechan main nar or maadaa ke milane se jo banaata he use shukritand, gamit ko assam yugmak or paudhe ko asamayugmiya yaa vividhpushpi kehete hai
 In addition to the above mentioned methods of reproduction, some other methods, such as sterilization, degeneration and desorption are also generated
 praaniyon main langik janan kii kai vidhiyaan hai, jinamein pramukh vidhiyaan hai- In normal sexual reproduction, two germ cells form a zygote
 do jantuon kii utpatti do vibhinn lingon ke janakon main hoti he
 Male sperm are called sperm and female uterus is called egg or egg
 ye janyu vishesh avyavon arthath jandon main utpann hote hai
 Male Janma is called testis and Female Janma is called Ovary
 purvokt donon janyuon ke milan ko sansechan kehete hai
 The impregnation results in the formation of zygote
 yugmajon ke khandikaran se bhrun banataa he or viksit hokar shishu rup main janm letaa he
 The testis is made up of spermatogenesis tubes
 prayek nalika kii ant:bhitti bhruneey apithilium kii bani hoti he, jiske gunan or vibhedikaran se shukranu banate hai
 This process takes place in three stages
 pehla kram gunan avasthaa, doosraa kram vruddhi avasthaa or teesraa kram paripakv avasthaa kaa he
 All cells of the embryonic epithelium are capable of formation, but only a few participate
 ye koshikaaye sutaravibhaajan dwaara jyamitiya anupaat main vibhajit hoti hai
 Cells formed by division are called spermatozoa
 shukranu-koshika-jan bade sookshm hote hai
 They start growing due to the accumulation of nutrients in them
 aisi varghit koshikaon ko praathmik shukranu koshika kehete hai
 They then enter a mature state
 yahan praathmik shukranu koshikaon kaa do baar vibhaajan hota he
 The first division is the meiosis or degradation division
 is vibhaajan ke purv praathmik shukranu koshik ke cendrak main upasthit chromosome kii sankhya dwiguneet hoti he, par ardhasuthran ke samay paitruk chromosome antargranthan dwaara jodon main vyavasthit he jo hai
 In intercorrelations, no two chromosome pairs are formed, but only such chromosome pairs are made of synonyms or synonyms and constructs
 is prakaar ardhasuthran main paitruk chromosomon kii sankhya agunit ho jaati he
 The cells now become second spermatocytes
 dwitiya shukranukoshika kaa ek baar phir vibhaajan hota he jise samasutran kehete hai
 This creates pre-sperm, which slowly transform into sperm
 lakshanik shukranu ke teen bhaag - sir, madhya khand yaa greeva or punch - hote hai
 Different sperm heads have different sizes
 adhikansh ke andakaar, par kis ke chadnuma, kisi ke kaagapench se tede yaa anya prakaar ke bhi hote hai
 They have a sharp forearm or acrosome at the front end
 madhya khand praaia: chota or belanaakaar hota he
 The axilla of the tail remains wrapped in it
 punch tantu ke rup main lambii or kramash: patali hoti jaati he or kashabh kii bhanti gatisheel hoti he
 It moves quickly, causing the sperm to enter the ovum by swimming in semen, or water
 andashay kii koshikaon se andey utpann hote hai
 Eggs also have multiplication stage, growth stage and mature stage
 andashay kii kuch utpaadak koshikaon ke gunan vibhaajan se dimb koshikajan banate hai
 In the cytogens, the ovules collect and grow and grow into the primary ovary
 inkaa phir se hraas vibhaajan hota he or ye do alag alag koshikaon main bant jate hai
 Of these, one is very small and the other is large
 choti ko pratham dhruviya pind ore badi ko dwitiya dimbkoshika kehete hai
 The second ovary has a threading division
 yahan bhi ek choti or duusari badi hoti he
 The large is called the mature or adult egg and the smaller is called the second polar body
 praathmik dhruviya pindon kaa bhi sutaran hokar dhruvakoshika praapt hoti hai
 Polar compositions are useless for reproduction
 ardhabhrun yaa hraas vibhaajan is kaaran aavashyak he ki is prakaar utpann janyuon ke sanyog se jo yugmaj bane unamem paitruk sutron kii sankhya utani hi rahe jitani us jati ke liye aavashyak he, anyathaa santan main paitruk gunon ke badal jane kii sambhaavna ho sakati he
 In order to keep the number of ancestral formulas fixed, their degradation division at the time of zygotic Jagak is necessary
 dimb ke shukranu se milane par hi nae jeev kii utpatti hoti he
 In animals that have sexual reproduction, the egg and sperm are produced in two different sexed animals
 inkaa sayujya nar or maadaa ke milakar sambhog karne se hota he
 At the time of sexual intercourse, the ovum and sperm come close, but Venus's union with the egg, that is, fertilization of the egg depends on many things
 paristhitiyon ke anukool na hone par andey kaa sansechan nahin hota
 The following circumstances are necessary for impregnation: ant: sansechan karanevaale praaniyon main andon kii sankhya bahut kam hoti he or ek baar main ek yaa kuch hi santan utpann hoti he, par jin praaniyon main bahya sansechan hota he, dimb kii sankhya atyadhik hoti he or andon kii apeksha shukranuon kii sankhya to or bhi adhik
 When eggs and sperm are mixed in water, there are many barriers to the zygotes, such as the temperature of the water, its acidity or alkalinity; Speed of water current, presence of other nearby aquatic creatures etc
 at: spishij kii shrinkhalaa banaae rakhane ke liye prakruti dimb or shukranuon kaa utpaadan adhik sankhya main karti he, kyonki in bahusankhyak andon ore shukranuon main se anek andey or shukranu uparyukt kaarnon main se koi bhi pratikul kaaran hene par asansechit avasthaa main mar jate hai
 a egg requires only one sperm for impregnation
 manushya ke ek baar ke maithun main skhlit veery main saamanyat: shukranuon kii sankhya 22,60,00,000 anumaanit kii gai he
 Of these, only one works to store the sperm egg
 prayek dimpotsurg main keval ek hi dimb dimbugranthi se nikalataa he
 As soon as a functioning sperm comes in contact with the egg of its own species, it enters it
 shukranu kaa sir to dimb ke andar ghus jaataa he, kintu uski punch tuutakar baahar hi rah jaati he
 Venus enters the egg and incites many events inside it
 sabase pehle vah dimb main kisi anya shukranu ke pravesh ko roktaa he
 This is how it works: sansechit andey ke bahya str se ek prakaar kaa rasinic srav nikalataa he, jo anya shukranu ko dimb kii ore aakarshith na kar vikarshith karata he athwa dimb ke baahar chaaron ore ek prakaar kii jelly jaisi jhilli ban jaati he, jisase shukranu kaa pravesh nahin ho paata athwa abhedya bhitti se ghira dimb kaa bilkul chota chhed, microple ek shukranu ke pravesh karte hi band ho jaataa he
 Upon insertion into the egg, the sperm meets the centroid of the egg, moving from the stipulated path to the nucleus, and both the sperm and the embryo merge to form chromosomes, which remain independent of the cytoplasm
 dimb ab yugmaj ban jaataa he
 The centrosonome of the egg disappears, but the centrosome of the sperm divides into two, forming a dynamic locus
 is tarku ke ayanvrutt ke chaaron ore chromosamem apni apni jagah le lete hai or sansechit dimbkosh kaa vibhaajan or vikaas shuru hokar bhrun kaa nirmaan hone lagata he
 Considering how the mass of the masses is known, it is found that in most cases, by accident, the male population is accidentally exposed to the floating female mass, but in some conditions the sperm move directly towards the specified target
 iskaa kaaran shukranu kaa kisi vishesh rasinic dravya kii ore aakarshith hona he
 This chemical substance produces egg
 ise rasinic karshan kehete hai
 But there is no chemical traction in every situation
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki nar janyu or maadaa janyu main dhruviya antar hota he, jisase ve paraspar aakarshith hote hai
 What is the real cause of attraction, it cannot be said for sure
 sambhog ke samay maadaa praaia: niskriy rahati he or nar main maadaa ke aalingan ke liye vividh bhanti ke aalingan avyav viksit hote hai
 Some creatures have minor figurative features, such as a beard, a mustache in a human male, and a lack of them in the female but developed breasts and a variety of different colors in sparrows, etc
 yah gaun lakshan gyanendriyon ko prabhavit kar nar tathaa maadaa kaa sanyog karaane main sahaayak hote hai
 Some animals also have some auxiliary components, which are meant to protect the offspring
 anek praaniyon main sansechan ke pashchaat maan-baap kii jimmedaariyaan samaapt ho jaati hai or yugmaj bina kisi dekharekh ke viksit hote hai, kuch praaniyon main bachche apana laalan paalan swayan karte hai, par kuch praaniyon main maan baap apni santan kii raksha kaa bada dhyaan rakhte hai
 They choose a suitable place to protect eggs or embryos
 kuch unako band rakhane kaa upaay bhi karte hai
 For this they manufacture coa
 anya jantuon main andnikshepak hote hai, jinamein ve andey surakshit rakhte hai athwa kisi jivit yaa mrit praani ke utak se ve yahi kaam lete hai
 At the same time, eggs develop and ovules are formed
 kuch praaniyon ke andey yaa dimbh maan yaa baap se chipke rahete hai
 Some parents take them in gills, some in baby bags, such as in crustaceans, some in nectaries, some in dilated ovaries and some in marsupial bags
 kuch praaniyon main dimb or shukranu kaa sanyog mata ke sharir ke andar hi hota he or yugmaj kaa khandikaran evam bhrun kaa vikaas bhi vahiin hota he
 Once the fetus is fully developed, the baby comes out of the mother's womb by delivery
 jitne dinon tak bhrun mata ke garbh main rahata he, utane samay ko garbhakaal kehete hai
 This type of development is called internal development
 kuch machhliyon, chhipakaliyon or pakshiyon main dimb kaa sansechan maithun dwaara maadaa ke sharir ke andar hi hota he or yugmaj athav sansechit dimb churnamay aavaran se mandit hokar sharir ke baahar nikalataa he
 Embryo development takes place outside
 purna viksit ho jane par baccha andey kii kholi ko todakar andey se baahar chalaa aata he
 This type of development is called external development
 machhliyon, medhakon tathaa nimna koti ke anya praaniyon main dimb or shukranu donon hi sharir ke baahar skhlit kiye jate hai or vahiin unka sanyog hota he tathaa andey baahar hi bhrun main viksit hote hai
 In this way, impregnation and development are also external
 gaay, bhens, bakrii, manushya ityadi, jinamein bhrun mata ke sharir ke bheetar parivardhit hota he or shishu jivit avasthaa main baahar nikalataa he, jarayuj kehalaate hai
 Unlike them, fish like frog, snake, lizard and bird, in which babies grow out of eggs, are called eggs
 adhikansh dashaon main bhrun kaa poshan maan ke rakt se, aparaa sadrush kisi sanyojak dwaara hota he
 a similar arrangement is found in some shark fishes, anablabs, some lizards and mammals
 kuch praaniyon main janm ke pashchaat athwa andey se baahar aane par navjaat shishu ko maan-baap bhojan khilaate hai
 Mammals have breasts, from which milk is secreted, this milk is a newborn's diet
 bahuteri chidiyon ke mukh se laar kaa srav hota he, jo chuujon kaa bhojan hota he
 Otherwise the birds swallow the food and put it in the baby's mouth
 sadharantaya vayask honaper janan prarambh hota he, par kuch praaniyon main jaise mizes or akzolatal main shishav avasthaa main hi janan prarambh ho jaataa he
 This is called asechan generation
 adhikansh praaniyon yaa paudhon kii jananritu, praaia: nishchit hoti he, dimb kaa vikaas ritu or vaataavaran par nirbhar karata he
 Many birds, insects and other animals have high reproductive activity in spring or summer season
 vaataavaran kii sthiti, taap, ardrata, shushkta ityadi sharirkriya ko prabhavit karti hai or inkaa prabhaav janan par bhi padataa he
 Reproduction is closely related to food
 jahaan vaataavaran ek sa rahata he, vahaan ke praaniyon main ritukal nishchit nahin hota, jaise philipine dwipon main jalwaayu kii paristhitiyon se hi kuch praaniyon kaa pravasan hota he or sahaayak jananendriyon main samayik, bahya yaa ant:parivartan hote hai
 In some animals, reproduction goes on throughout life, but in some, with the increase of age, the reproductive function becomes slow or stops altogether
 adhikansh praaniyon main janankriyasheeltaa ke bad vishram kaal aata he or uske baad phir ritukal aarambh hota he
 This sequence happens in series or alternately
 ucch koti ke praaniyon main, jinamein manushya bhi aata he, garam hona, raj:srav athwa andanu utpaadan bhi krambaddh hote hai
 There are some glands in the body of animals, which have no duct
 in grathiyon se hormone banate hai, jo sidhe rakt main chale jate hai
 These circulate throughout the body along with the bloodstream and produce different effects on the body
 ye kuch angon ko uddipt karte or kuch kaa daman karte hai
 Among them, the pituitary gland and the gonad have a very dense relationship with reproduction
 kuch praaniyon main nar jananendriya or nari jananendrit donon hoti hai tathaa shukranu or andey ek hi praani main utpann hote hai
 They are bisexual beings
 inamen yaa to ek hi prakaar ke chromosome andar hi paraspar milakar janan karte hai, jise swayansesechan kehete hai, athwa do ubhayalingi jode khaakar paraspar ek duusare ke andey kaa sansechan karte hai, jise swayansansechan kehete hai, athwa do ubhayalingi jode khaakar paraspar ek duusare ke andey kaa sansechan karte hai, jise 'cross' kehete hai
 Ketchus, leeches, snails and hydra are examples of the previous type
 swayansansechan birla hi paaya jaataa he
 It does not have to be a combination of eggs and Venus
 ise akshatyounik janan bhi kehete hai
 Examples of this are bees and aphids
 madhumakhiyaan kuch sansechit or kuch asansechit yaa agarbhit andey detii hai
 Workless and queen bees are produced from uncultivated eggs, and drones or male bees are produced from uncultivated eggs
 kuch saamudrik praaniyon, jaise si archin main bhi asansechit andey se nae praani kaa utpaadan vaigyanikon ne sambhav kiya he
 Bangchi has been produced by adopting a frog's egg with a needle and developing it
 is prakaar bhautik or rasinic vidhiyon se bhi andey ko viksit hone ke liy safaltaapurvak prerit kiya gaya he
 The liver worm and the tiger salamander have an unusual pattern of reproduction, called ovulation
 isamen jab praani dimbhavstha main hi rahete hai or purna vayask nahin hue rahete tabhi janan karne lagate hai or santanvruddhi karte hai

 With this view, the place of Acharya Hemchandra's texts in the literature of Jainism is invaluable

 gayan ek aisi kriya he jisase swar kii sahaayta se sangitamay dhwani utpann kii jaati he or jo saamaanya bolchaal kii gunvattta ko raag or taal donon ke prayog se badhaati he
 The person who sings is called a singer or gawaiya
 gayak geet gaate hai jo ekal ho sakate hai yani bina kisi or saaj yaa sangeet ke saath yaa phir sangitagnon va ek saaj se lekar puure arcestra yaa bade band ke saath gaae ja sakate hai
 Singing is often performed in groups of other musicians, such as with many singers with different vocals, or with artists playing a variety of instruments, such as with a rock group or baroque organization
 har vah vyakti jo bol saktaa he vah ga bhi saktaa he, kyonki gayan boli kaa hi ek parishkrut rup he
 Singing can be informal and can be performed for satisfaction or pleasure, such as while bathing or in kairaoke; Or it can also be very formal, such as during a religious ritual or during professional singing on stage or in recording studios
 oonche darje ke peshewar yaa nausikhiye gayan ke liye saamanytah nirdesan or niyamit abhyaas aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Professional singers typically build their profession in one type of music, such as classical or rock, and ideally they conduct vocal training throughout their careers with the help of a vocal teacher or vocalist
 apane bhautik pahalu main, gayan ek acchhee tarah se paribhaashit takanic he jo fefdon ke prayog par, jo hawa kii aapurti, yaa dhaunkani kii tarah kaary karte hai, swar yantra jo bansuri yaa kampak kaa kaam karata he, vaksh or sir kii guhaaen, jo vaayu vaadun main nalee kii tarah, dhwani vistaarak kaa kaary karti hai or jeebh jo taalu, daanton or hothon ke saath milakar swaron or vyanjanon kaa uccharan karti he, par nirbhar hoti he
 Although these four systems operate independently, they are coordinated to establish a facet technique and are designed to interact with each other
 niskriy shwaas kriya ke samay, hawa madhyapatal ke saath andar lee jaati he jabaki uchhvas kii kriya bina kisi prayaas ke ho jaati he
 Abdominal, internal intercostal and semi-pelvic muscles can be helpful in the action of exhalation
 bahya antarpasleey, skaline or sternocleadomastid peshiyaan uchhvas main sahaayta karti hai
 The vocal cords change the pitch of the voice
 hothon ko band rakh kar swar utpann karne ko gunagunaane kii sangya di jaati he
 The unique voice of each person's singing is not only due to the actual shape and texture of the ropes but also depends on the shape and texture of the remaining body of that person
 manushya ke swar rajjuon kii motaai dhili kii ja sakati he yaa, kasi ja sakati he yaa badali bhi ja sakati he or un par se hawa badalte hue dabaav ke saath pravaahit kii ja sakati he
 The shape of the thoracic and neck, the position of the tongue and the tension of otherwise unrelated muscles can be changed
 inamen se kisi bhi kaary ke hone par utpann aawaaj kii pich, aaytan, lay yaa sur main parivartan ho jaataa he
 Sound also resonates in different parts of the body and the shape and bone structure of a person can affect the sound produced by that person
 gayak aawaaj ko kuch is tarah prastut karnaa bhi sikh sakate hai jisase ki vah unke swar tantra main behatar tareeke se gunj sake
 It is known as vocal resonance
 mukhar swar or utpaadan par ek pramukh prabhaav swar yantra ke kaary se hota he, jise log bhinn tareekon se prayog karke bhinn prakaar ke swar utpann karte hai
 These different types of vocal instrument functions are described as different types of vocal registers
 is safalataa ke liye gayakon dwaara prayukt vidhi main gayak ke farment kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, jise kaan ke aavruti daayre ke sabase adhik samvedansheel bhaag se khaas taur par anukool paaya gaya he
 Template: Vocal registration Vocal registration refers to the system of vocal registers located within the human voice
 maanav aawaaj kii panji ek vishesh suron kii shrinkhalaa hoti he, jo swar rajjuon ke samaan companon main utpann hoti he or ek samaan gunvattta liye hoti he
 The basic sound of the registers is in the function of the instrument
 ve isaliye hoti hai kyonki swar rajjuon main kai alag alag tarah ke kampan utpann karne kii kshamta hoti he
 These types of vibrations appear in a particular range of pitches and produce a special tone
 shabd "panji" kuch bhraamak ho saktaa he kyonki yah maanav aawaaj ke kai pahaluon ko apane main sanjoe hota he
 The word register can also be used to refer to any of the following: bhashaa vigyaan main, ek panjikrut bhashaa vah bhashaa he jo sur or swar ko ek ekal swar vigyaan pranali main sanyukt karti he
 In speech pathology, there are three elements of the word vocal register - a certain vibration type of vocal states, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of voice
 vaak rogvisheshgy swaryantr ke sharir vigyaan kriya ke aadhaar par chaar mukhar panjiyon kii pahchaan karte hai - mukhar frai panji, modal panji, phalsato panji or siti panji
 This view has also been adopted by many vocal academics
 swar pratidhwanikaran ek prakriya he jiske dwaara swar utpaadankriya ke mul utpaada ke sur yaa gaharaai ko hawa se bhari guhaaon dwaara us samay badhaayaa jaataa he jab vah unamem se bahari hawa tak jate hue guzarati he
 Many words related to resonance include phonation, amplification, elaboration, correction, intensification, and lengthening, although for sure scientific experimentation, vowel officials question most of them
 kisi gayak yaa vaktaa dwaara in shabdon se nikaala jane vaala mukhya nishkarsh yah hota he ki pratidhwani kaa antim parinaam ek behatar aawaaj honi chaiye
 There are seven areas in the body that can be listed as possible vocal resonators
 sharir main sabase neeche kii sthiti se sabase upar kii sthiti kii shrankhla main ye kshetra hai, vaksh, vayunalee vriksh, swaryantr, galaa, mukhaguha, naasguha or sinus
 Chest voice and head voice are terms used in vocal music
 in padon kaa prayog maukhik swar shikshavidon main bade paimaane par bhinn tarah se hota he or vartmaan main in padon ke vishay main mukhar sangeet peshewaron main koi sthir raay nahin he
 The chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the vocal range or a particular type of vocal register - the vocal resonance area, or the specific vocal cadence
 sheersh swar kaa prayog bhi swar kii seemaa ke kisi vishesh bhaag yaa swar panji ke prakaar yaa swar gunjan kshetra ke sandarbh main kiya ja saktaa he
 The first written reference to thoracic and vertex is found around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from throat tones by authors named Johannes de Garlandia and Jerome of Moravia
 in padon ko baad main bel canto naamak italvi apera gayan vidhi main samavisht kar liya gaya, jisamen vaksh swar ko teenon swar panjiyon-vaksh, paisagiyo or sheersh panji: main sabase neeche or sheersh swar ko sabase ooncha sthaan diya gaya tha
 This thing is still taught by some vocal academics
 aajkal prachlit bel canto model par aadhaarit ek or paddati ke anusaar purush or stri ke swaron ko teen panjiyon main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 The voices of men are divided into thoracic register, apex register and falsetto register, and women's voices are divided into thoracic register, middle register, and head register
 ye shikshavid kehete hai ki sheersh panji gayak ke sir main mahasoos kiye jane vaale gunjan kaa varnan karne ke liye gayan main prayukt ek swar takanic he
 But in the last two hundred years, knowledge of human physiology and understanding of physical activity of singing and vocal production has increased
 parinamswaroop kai swarshikshavidon jaise indiana vishvavidhyalay ke ralf appelman or dakshini california vishvavidhyalay ke wiliam venard ne vaksh swar or sheersh swar padon ke prayog ko punarparibhaashit kar diya he yaa unka prayog karnaa hi band kar diya he
 In particular, the use of the terms chest register and head register have become controversial because vocal register is nowadays seen as a product of the function of the vocal system that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head
 isi vajah se kai swar shikshavid yah tark karte hai ki panjiyon ke vaksh yaa sir main utpann hone kii baat karnaa anargal he
 They say that the vibrations felt in these areas are resonances and should be described in terms related to the resonance of the vowel rather than the registers
 ye swar shikshavid panji ke sthaan par vaksh swar or sheersh swar padon kaa prayog adhik pasand karte hai
 According to this view, the problems that people consider as register problems are actually problems of resonance adjustment
 yah najariya vaak rogashastra, swar vigyaan or bhashavigyaan sahit swar panjiyon kaa adhyayan karne vaale anya shaikshanik kshetron ke najariyon se bhi saamanjasy rakhata he
 Although both methods are still in use, the current vocal pedagogical profession prefers to adopt a new more scientific approach
 haa, kuch swar shikshavid donon najariyon ke vichaaron kaa prayog karte hai
 The contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific vocal letter or vocal cadence
 shastreey gayan main, iskaa prayog puri tarah se modal panji yaa saamaanya swar ke nichle bhaag tak hi simit hota he
 In other forms of singing, chest voice is often used throughout the modal register
 vaksh sur gayak ke swar kii arthpurna rangapattica main swaron kii ascharyajanak qatari laga sakate hai
 But in an attempt to produce higher tones in the chest, the use of a more powerful thorax in the higher registers can produce force
 balaprayog se antatogatva swar kaa hraas ho saktaa he
 Template: Vocal range In European classical music and opera, vowels are used as musical instruments
 swar sangeet likhane vaale geetkaaron ko gayakon ke hunar or swar ke gunon kii pahchaan hona aavashyak hota he
 Vocal classification is a process by which human vocal sounds are evaluated and named for different vocal types
 in gunon main swar kaa dayera, swar kaa vajan, swar kaa tesityara, swar kii gaharaai or swar ke parivartan bindu jaise swar ke tod or uthaav aadi shaamil hote hai
 Other things to note include physical properties, speech level, scientific test and vocal registration
 europea shastreey sangeet main viksit swar vargeekaran se sambandhit vigyaan gayan ke adhik aadhunik prakaaron se anukulan main pichad gaya he
 Vowel classification is often used in opera to link future vowels to possible roles
 shastreey sangeet main aajkal kai vibhinn pranaliyaan hai jinamein shaamil hai-german faiq pranali or coral sangeet pranali
 One system is neither applicable nor accepted in all places
 phir bhi adhikansh shastreey sangeet pranaliyaan saat bhinn mukhya swar prakaaron ko manyata detii hai
 Women are divided into three groups - soprano, mezzo-soprano and contralto
 purushon ko saamanytah chaar samoohon main baanta gaya he - countertinor, tinor, baritone or bas
 An eighth term, treble, can be used when paying attention to the voices of children before the age of puberty
 in sabhi mukhya prakaaron main se har ek ke kai upaprakaar hote hai jo awaajon kii alag pahchaan ke liye vishisht swar gunon jaise calratura suvidha va swar ke vajan kii pahchaan karte hai
 It should be noted that in choral music, the vocals of singers are divided only on the basis of depth of voice
 coral sangeet prayek ling main adhiktar swar ke bhaagon ko oonchi or nichi awaajon, yaa sopraano, alto, tinor or bas) main baantta he
 As a result, there is great potential for degradation in the ideal coral position
 chunki adhikansh logon kii aawaaj madhyam hoti he, unhen unke liye yaa to bahut ooncha yaa bahut nicha bhaag dena chaiye; mezo-sopraano ko sopraano yaa alto gaanaa chaiye or baritone ko tinor yaa bas gaanaa chaiye
 Each choice may present difficulties for the singer, but for most singers, singing in lower notes is less risky than singing in high notes
 sangeet ke samakaleen prakaaron main gayakon ko unke dwaara gaae jane vaale sangeet ke anusaar vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, jaise jaiz, pop, vlooj, sol, country, fok, yaa rock sheliyaan
 There is currently no official vocal classification in non-classical music
 anya prakaar ke gayan main shastreey swar ke prakaaron kaa prayog karne ke praytn kiye gaye hai lekin aise praytn vivadagrast ho gaye hai
 The classification of vowel types was developed on the belief that the singer would use classical vocal technique within a particular range with unbounded vocal production
 chunki samakaleen sangitajna bhinn swar takneekon, microphonon, kaa prayog karte hai or vishisht swar bhoomika main jamane ke liye majaboor nahin hote hai, isaliye sopraano, tinor, baritone jaise padon kaa prayog bhraamak yaa galat ho saktaa he
 The study of singing teaching is called vocal pedagogy
 swar shikshashastra kii kala or vigyaan kaa ek lanbaa itihaas he jo pracheen greece main shuru hua tha or aaj tak viksit or parivartit ho rahaa he
 Professionals in the art and science of vocal pedagogy include vocal instructors, choral directors, vocal music teachers, opera directors, and other vocal teachers
 swar shikshashastra ke siddhant upyukt swar takanic ke vikaas kaa bhaag hai
 Ideal areas for study include the following: upyukt swar kii takanic se kiya gaya gayan ek ekikrut or samanvayit kriya he jo gayan kii bhautik prakriyaaon ko prabhavi rup se sanyojit karti he
 Four physical processes are used in oral vocal production - respiration, vocal production, resonance and pronunciation
 ye prakriyaayein nimna shrankhla main hoti hai: Although these four processes are studied separately at the time of study, in reality they are combined into a combined task
 kisi prabhaavshaalee gayak yaa vaktaa ke saath sunne vaale kaa dhyaan kabhi usamen hone vaali prakriya kii ore nahin jaataa he kyonki man or sharir is tarah se samyojit ho jate hai ki sunne vaale ko keval uske falswaroop utpann ekikrut kaary kaa hi dhyaan rahata he
 Many vocal problems arise when there is a lack of adjustment in this process
 chunki gayan ek samyojit upkram he, isaliye kisi bhi vyaktigat takneekee kshetra or prakriyaaon ke bare main anya logon ke sandarbh ke bina kahana kathin hota he
 For example, vowel formation can only be said when it is associated with respiration, echoes affect resonance, antiperspirants affect vocal cords, vocal cords affect breathing control, etc
 swar ke vikaron ke kaaran akasar us samyojit prakriya ke ek bhaag main rukawat aa jaati he jisase swar adyapak ko apane vidhyaarthee main prakriya ke kisi ek bhaag par adhik jor dena padataa he jab tak ki vah samasya thik na ho jaay
 But some areas of the art of singing result from adjusted work that it is difficult to talk about them under traditional names such as vocalization, resonance, pronunciation or respiration
 ek baar vidhyaarthee gayan kii kriya main kaam aane vaali prakriyaaon va unki karypranali ke prati sajag ho jaataa he to vah unka samaayojan karne kii koshish main lag jaataa he
 Inevitably students and teachers become more concerned about one type of technology
 kai prakriyaayein bhinn daron par aage bad sakati hai jisase ek asantulan yaa samaayojan kii kami ho jaati he
 Areas of vocal tone that depend most on the student's ability to adjust to different tasks are: gayan ek hunar he jiske liye ucch rup se viksit peshi prativarti kriyaaon kii jarurat hoti he
 Singing does not require much muscular strength but a high level of muscular adjustment is required
 log apane swaron ko geeton or swar ke vyaayaamon ke dhyanpurvak or vyavasthit abhyaas dwaara viksit kar sakate hai
 Vocal academics instruct their students to exercise their voice wisely
 gayakon ko hameshaa yah sochna hota he ki ve kis tarah kii aawaaj nikaal rahe hai or gaate samay unhen kis tarah kii anubhuti ho rahi he
 Vocal exercises have several purposes, including warming up the voice, expanding the scope of the voice, tapping the voice horizontally and vertically, and learning vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, sharp speaking, at wide intervals
 Learning to sing comfortably, singing with a staggered sound, melisma singing and correction of vocal errors
 swar ke vikaas kaa ek mahatvapurn lakshya he, gun yaa takanic main parivartan kii ore bina kisi tarah kaa dhyaan khinche apane swar ke daayre kii prakritik seemaa ke bheetar gaanaa siikhnaa
 Vocal pedagogists say that a singer can achieve this goal only when all the physical processes required for singing are effectively working together
 adhikansh swar shikshavid in prakriyaaon ke samaayojan ke liye swar ke sabase arampurna tesitura main acchhee gayan kii aadaton ke nirmaan or phir apane daayre ko dhire-dhire badhaane main vishwaas karte hai
 There are three factors that affect the ability to sing higher or lower: mckini kaa kahana he, ye teenon ghatak teen mul niyamon main vyakt kiya ja sakate hai - jab aap ooncha gaate hai, aapako adhik urja kaa prayog karnaa chaiye, jab aap neeche gaate hai to aap kam urja kaa prayog karnaa hota he
 When you sing higher, you have to use more space, when you sing lower, you use less space
 jab aap ooncha gaate hai, aap adhik gaharaai kaa prayog karte hai, jab aap nichle sur main gaate hai, aapako kam gaharaai kii jarurat hoti he
 The singing process works best in the presence of certain physical conditions of the body
 hawa ko sharir main mukt rup se khinchne or baahar nikaalane or hawa kii aavashyak maatra ke praapt karne kii kshamta shwasan prakriya ke bhinn bhaagon kii mudra dwaara gambhir rup se prabhavit ho sakati he
 Chest pressure limits the capacity of the lungs and strict stomach can prevent the diaphragm from coming down
 acchhee mudra shwasan prakriya ko apana mul kaary urja ke vyarth kharch ke bina sucharu rup se karne detii he
 Good posture makes it easier to initiate vocal formation and tuning of resonators as the correct combination prevents unnecessary tension in the body
 swar shikshavidon ne yah baat bhi dekhi he ki jab gayak acchhee mudra apanaate hai, to unhen gaate samay adhik aatmavishvaas kaa anubhav hota he
 Listeners also respond better to singers with good posture
 adatan acchhee mudra behatar rakt pravaah or sharir ko thakaan va tanaav se bachaakar antatogatva sharir ke kul swasthya main sudhaar laati he
 The ideal singing posture has eight parts: prakritik shwasan kii teen avasthaaen hoti hai, bheetar ko saans lenaa, saans ko baahar nikaalnaa or vishram kii avasthaa, ye avasthaaen saamaanya taur par jaanboojh kar niyantrit nahin hoti hai
 Singing consists of four stages of breathing, breathing in, control-making period, a controlled ejaculation period, and a rehabilitation period
 ye avasthaaen tab tak gayak ke niyantran main honi chaiye jab tak ki ve prativarti kriyaayein na ban jaaen
 Many singers relinquish conscious controls before their reflexes are converted, which eventually leads to long-term vocal problems
 wibrato kaa prayog gayakon dwaara tab kiya jaataa he jab koi anwarat sur teji se or lagaataar upar or neeche kii pich main jaataa he jisase sur main jaraa sa kampan utpann ho jaataa he
 Vibrato is a wave in a continuous tone
 wibrato prakritik rup se hota he or uchit shwaas samarthan or aaraam kii sthiti main kaam kar rahe swar yantra kaa parinaam hota he
 Some singers use vibrato as an expression
 kai safal kalakaaron ne gahare, prachur wibrato kii neenv par apane kariyar kaa nirmaan kiya he
 Vocal music is music performed by one or more singers, with or without musical instruments, which form the main part of singing
 mukhar sangeet shaayad sangeet kaa sabase pracheen prakaar he, kyonki ise maanviya swar ke alaava or kisi saaj kii jarurat nahin hoti
 Some kind of vocal music is found in all musical cultures and there have been long-standing traditions of singing in all cultures all over the world
 aisa sangeet jo gayan kaa prayog to karata he par use mukhya rup se pesh nahin karata he, saamaanya taur par saaj-sangeet mana jaataa he
 For example, some blues rock songs may have a simple call-and-response chorus, but the song has more emphasis on instrumental melodies
 mukhar sangeet adarsh rup se gaae hue shabdon jinhen geet kehete hai, ko pesh karata he, haalaanki mukhar sangeet ke aise bhi udhaaharan hai jinhen bina bhashaa vaale shabdon yaa awaajon - kabhi-kabhi sangeet ke onomotapia ke rup main - kaa prayog kiye bhi prastut kiya gaya he
 a small piece of vocal music sung with a song is called a song
 mukhar sangeet ko kai bhinn tareekon or shaileyon main likhaa jaataa he jinhen akasar kisi khaas vidha kaa naam diya jaataa he
 These genres include: art music, popular music, traditional music, regional and national music and blends of these genres
 in mukhya vidhaon main kai up-vidhaaen hoti hai
 E
g
 Popular music includes blues, jazz, country music, easy listening, hip hop, rock music and many other genres
 ek up-vidha main ek or up-vidha bhi ho sakati he, jaise, jaaz main vokeleez or scat gayan
 In many modern pop music groups, one lead singer performs the primary vocals or melody of the song, and another singer performs vocals or vocalizations on the back of the song
 pichley gayak gane ke kuch, lekin saamaanya taur par puure nahin, hisson kaa gayan hi karte hai or akasar gane ke parshv main gunagunaane jaisaa kaary karte hai
 An exception to this is the five-part Gospel Kapella music, in which the lead voice is the highest of the five voices, and she sings fluctuations, not songs
 kuch kalakaar audio ricardingon main ricard kiye hue sangeet ko aachhadit karke mukhya or pichley donon prakaar kaa gayan kar lete hai
 Popular music may include many vocal styles
 hip-hop reping kaa prayog karata he, jisamen kisi taal par bina kisi sahyog ke geeton ko talpurna rup se prastut kiya jaataa he
 Some types of wrapping have complete or most colloquial or pronounced words, like Jamaican toasting
 kuch anya prakaar kii reping main gayak chote yaa adhure gaae gaye bhaagon ko jod sakate hai
 Blues singing is based on the use of blue notes — notes that are sung at a pitch lower than the main note for expression
 baari dhaatu or hardkor pank upavidhaon main, mukhar shaileyon main cheekh, chillaahat or maut ke gurraane jaise asaamaanya swar shaamil ho sakate hai
 One difference between live performances of popular and classical genres is that while classical singers often sing in small or medium-sized halls without the aid of amplifiers, in popular music, microphones and PA systems are used in almost all productions
 Goes, even if it is in a small coffee house
 microphone ke prayog kaa lokapriy sangeet par kai tarah se prabhaav hua he
 One, it has led to the development of intimate and expressive singing styles such as crooning, in which adequate projection or production of voice would not have been possible without a microphone
 isi tarah, microphone kaa prayog karne vaale pop gayak itani anya sur shaileyon kii prastuti kar sakate hai jo bina dhwani-vistaarak ke nahin ho saktaa he, jaise, fusfusaahat kii aawaaj nikaalnaa, gunagunaanaa or aadhi or puri gaai hui dhunon kaa mishran karnaa
 Similarly, some singers produce effects using a microphone, such as achieving an enhanced bass effect by bringing the mic too close to the mouth, or creating a tabla-like effect by removing the explosive vocals of p and b in the mic like hip-hop beatboxers
 
 jabaki kuch band parshv main sthit gayakon kaa prayog keval manch par gane ke samay hi karte hai, lokapriy sangeet main parshvik gayakon kii anya bhoomikaayen bhi hoti hai
 Many rock and metal bands also perform instrumental music, such as rhythm guitar, electric bass, or drums
 latin yaa afro-cubai samoohon main, parshvik gayak gaate samay taal milaane vaale vaadya yaa shiker bajaate hai
 In some pop and hip-hop groups and musical theaters, singers from headset microphones have to act in elaborately crafted dances
 gayakon ke mehnataanon or kaary-dashaon main bahut bhinnata dekhne main aati hai
 While jobs in other areas of music, such as music education, are full-time, salaried, singing jobs are based on solo productions or performances or their series
 gayan kii naukariyon se aay chunki aniyamit hoti he, gayak akasar apni aay ko sangeet se sambandhit anya kaam, jaise gayan kaa prashikshan dekar, swar ke paath padhaakar yaa carch main coral nirdeshak kaa kaam karke badhaate hai
 Due to the high number of aspiring singers, getting a job in singing can be very competitive
 carch ke gayakon ke dal main ekal gayak 30 se 500 dollars tak kama sakate hai
 People in a community choir group can earn from $ 200 to $ 3000 per year, while members of a choral group of professional programs earn $ 80 or more per performance
 radio yaa tivi ke pradarshnon main bhaag lene vaale gayak sthaneey stesan par 75 dollars prati pradarshan or rashtriya network sho yaa enbisi ) main 125 yaa adhik dollars kii kamai kar sakate hai
 Jazz or pop singers working in dance bands or nightclub performance groups can earn up to $ 225 or more per week
 peshewar apera kores gayak 350 se 750 dollars prati saptaah tak lete hai
 Your single singers, for whom jobs are very limited, can get from 350 to 2 xxrep 4 0 dollars
 shastreey kaarykram ke ekal gayak, jinke liye naukari ke avasar kaaphi simit hai, prati pradarshan lagbhag 350 dollars yaa adhik kii kamai karte hai
 Those aspiring to become a singer are required to possess musical skills, excellent voice, ability to work with people and have a passion for performing and theatricality
 iske alaavaagayakon main lagaataar seekhney or parishkar karne kii aakanksha or lagan honi chaiye, kyonki gayan kaa adhyayan praarambhik diploma yaa degree ke samaapt hone ke saath khatm nahin hota-peshewar gayak apane praarambhik prashikshan ke samaapt hone ke kai dashakon baad bhi apane hunar ko badhaane or nai sheliyaan seekhney ke liye sangeet kaa prashikshan praapt karne kaa praytn karte rahete hai
 As well as those aspiring to become a singer, to understand songs, to read vocal literature of their chosen musical style, and to specialize in techniques of choral music, visual singing and memorizing songs, original piano skills, new Special skills in vocal techniques are needed to help learn the song and for ear exercises or oral exercises
 shastreey gayan or kuch anya vidhaon main, videshi bhashaaon jaise french, italvi, german yaa anya bhashaaon kaa gyaan hona aavashyak he
 Prior to college and university training, aspiring singers should learn to read music, study basic piano, and gain experience in singing in both group anthem and solo situations
 college or vishwavidhyalay kaa prashikshan hameshaa jaruri nahin hota lekin uske baraabar ke prashikshan kaa hona aam taur par aavashyak he
 After secondary school, training is available for both classical and non-classical singers in singing
 shastreey shrenee main gayan kaa adhyayan conservetariyon or university sangeet kaaryakramon main kiya ja saktaa he, isse diploma or bachaler degree se lekar master kii degree or doctor of musical arts tak kii oopaadhiyaan uplabdh hai
 In popular and jazz styles, college and university degrees are available, although the number of such programs is small
 gayak banane ke icchhuk vidhyaarthiyon ke apane peshewar prashikshan ko puraa kar lene ke baad, unhen kisi apera nirdeshak, koyrmaster yaa conductor ke saamne gayan kii pariksha dekar sangeet ke hunar ke kharidaaron ke sammukh swayan ko bechney ke liye kadam uthaane chaiye
 The style of vocal music the person is trained in, the people buying the skills, may be representatives of a record company, opera or musical theater director, choir director, night club manager or concert promoter
 apane prashikshan or pradarshan ke anubhav ko darshaate hue apane sankshit parichay ke alaava gayak ek promotional kit taiyaar karte hai jisamen peshewar tareeke se liye gaye photo, apane gayan ke abhinay se yukt sidi yaa dividi or sangeet ke aalochakon yaa patrakaron kii samikshaon kii pratiyaan hoti hai
 Some singers also hire an agent or manager for interviews and other acting opportunities, the agent or manager is often paid a percentage of the fees received from working on stage
 vaigyanik adhyayanon se gyaat hua he ki gayan kaa logon ke swasthya par sakaaratmak asar ho saktaa he
 a primary study conducted by the self-reported survey of students participating in choral singing found an increase in lung capacity, improved mood, decreased stress and social and spiritual benefits
 phir bhi, fefdon kii kshamta ke ek kaaphi puraane adhyayan main peshewar gayan ke prashikshan praapt logon kii tulana bina prashikshan vaale logon se kii gai or fefdon kii kshamta ke badhane ke daavon ke samarthan main koi baat nahin pai gai

 Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov was born in a lower middle-class Russian peasant family on 24 May 1905
 unka parivaar don kazzak sena ke bhootpurv kshetra veshenskaya stanitsa ke crujhilin khutor main rahata tha
 His father did many things from farming and animal trading to weaving cloth
 unki ashikshit maan ek ukraini kisaan parivaar kii thim or ek kazzak kii vidhwaa thim
 He later learned to read and write writing for the purpose of lettering to his son
 mikhail shologov kii shiksha kargin, boguchaar or veshenskaya ke kai skulon main hui
 He served as a laborer, general clerk and teacher
 dhoop se tapate vistrut maidaanon main gum-gum kar mikhail ne baalpan se hi jivan kii nagn vaastaviktaaon ko dekha tha
 His body was a witness to this - which had turned into copper color due to continuous heat in the sun
 apni javaani ke dinon main unhone kheton main kadi mehnat kii thi, hal chalaaya tha, beej boyaa tha or fasalein kaati thim
 The small canoe of the fishermen in the Don River was searched in that area
 kathin paristhitiyon main bhi unhone hansnaa siikhaa tha
 In 1918, when the upper two regions also came under the grip of civil war, the continuation of Sholokhov's studies ended untimely
 nirnay kii aitihaasik ghadi main shologov ne apana rasta chunane main koi hichak nahin dikhaayi
 At that time, the Bolsheviks were battling against the subversive actions of the remnants of anti-soviet white guards in the upper two regions and the rebellions of the Kajakas
 shologov ne bolshevikon kaa paksh liya or laal sena main shaamil hokar pratikriyaavaadiyon se loha liya
 He later used these experiences in his works

 Initially he also wrote plays which were staged by members of youth clubs

 These creations took Sholokhov to the pinnacle of both accomplishment and fame
 shologov main apane purv ke sheershasth kathakaron ke vaishishtyon kaa uttam rasinic sammishraran miltaa he; phir bhi ve unase or apane samakalinon se sarvatha pruthak nazar aate hai
 In fact, along with the scientific realist vision that penetrated the essence of reality, the upbeat impulse of revolutionary Romanticism was inherited by Maxim Gorky to Sholokhov
 vaividhypurna yathartwaadee drishy- sarjana or charitra-nirupan main ve lev tolastoy ke uttaradhikari prathit hote hai
 He also reminds of Tolstoy in the presentation of the tragedies of human destiny and the underlying optimism of life
 or "aatma kii jasusi" ke maamle main ve gogol ke shishy adhik lagate hai
 The popularity of these works can be gauged from the fact that within the 1960s only 149 editions of 'dheere Bahe Do Do Re 


' and 120 editions of 'awakening of the virgin land' were published

 janata ne unke sahitya ko hriday se apanaaya kyonki unka sahitya vastutah desh kii janata ko hi antahhruday se samarpit tha
 In his lecture given on the occasion of receiving the Nobel Prize, he also said that i have been following my duty as a writer and still believe that everything i have written so far and what i will write next, this labor i salute the people, the construction people and the brave people, the people who have never attacked anyone, but who have done their life, their freedom and respect , Has always been able to vigorously defend his right to build his future according to his will

 This theory evolved from the concept of continental displacement, envisaged in the first decade of the twentieth century, when new evidence was discovered in the 1960s that strengthened the concept of continents being dynamic rather than static
 in saakshyon main sabase mahatvapurn hai purachumbakatv se sambandhit sakshya jinase sagar nital prasaran kii pushti hui
 The discovery of Sagar Nittal Varshan by Harry Hayes is believed to be the beginning of the rendering of this theory and scholars like Wilson, Morgan, mckenzie, Oliver, Parker etc
 contributed to its promotion by providing evidence in its favor

 Wagner was the first to use the term "continental displacement", following the same principle of Wagner that the development of plate tectonics was possible, although his ideas were also rejected by scholars for nearly half a century until evidence was available in the 1960s
 
 or mahadwipiya visthaapan Due to the mobility of the plates, there are three types of edges or borders: is prakaar ke kinaaron ke sahare do platen ek duusare kii ore gati karti hai or takaraakar unamem se baari plate halaki plate ke neeche kshepit hoti he
 This part, which is twisted downward, goes deep and melts and converts into magma due to the excess of heat and pressure
 jis gaharaai par yah ghatana hoti he use kshepan mandal yaa beniof zone kehete hai
 With the help of such edges, due to pressure of the landowners, they turn and form mountains
 neeche jaakar pighla padaarth megma plum ke rup main upar uth kar jwalamukhiyata bhi utpann karata he
 Where two plates move opposite to each other, that is, they move away from each other, magma rises up from the bottom to form a new plate

 Rift valleys are formed when this shore lies on a continent
 nayi plate ke nirmaan ke kaaran ise rachanaatmak kinaaraa bhi kehete hai
 The protective edge is the one with which the two platens are moving, rubbing each other, that is, neither descending nor converging
 saamanytah is kinare ke sahare ek duusare ko ragadate huye vipareet dishaao main gatisheel hoti hai kintu yah anivaary nahin he, yadi do platen ek hi disha main gatisheel hon or unki gati alag-alag ho tab bhi unke kinare ragadate huye sangrakshi kinaaraa bana sakate hai
 Transform faults are found on their support

 Plate tectonics theory offers the newest explanation of the construction of fine mountains
 udhaaharan ke liye alpine parvat tantra ke parvaton kii utpatti kii vyakhya ko prastut kiya ja saktaa he
 According to this theory it is believed that the series of mountains on the northern and southern sides of the Mediterranean Sea are the result of tectonic events in the Tertiary era in which they were formed by compression between the African and European plates of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sea
