 Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates such as the Antarctic
 In fact, some species of penguins now live only a few south

 Among the present-day penguins, larger penguins live in colder regions, while smaller penguins are also commonly found in temperate or tropical climates
 Some prehistoric species were as tall and weighed in size as an adult human
 This species was not limited to the Antarctic regions; Rather, the Antarctic subcontinent was more diverse in the regions, and at least one giant penguin has been found in an area not far from 35 to 2000 km south of the equator and where the climate is warmer than it is today
 "penguin" shabd kii vyutpatti atyaadhik vivaadit he
 The English word is apparently not of French nor of Breton or of Spanish origin, but the first appears to be of English or Dutch language

 An alternative etymology is found in English dictionaries, which link the word to the Latin language pinguis "fat", because of its perceived shape
 yah vyutpatti asambhav hogi yadi "penguin" ko "multah" great ouk ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa tha, jaisaa ki kuch sutron kaa kahana he

 In the absence of direct evidence, it may be said that by the end of the Cretaceous, penguin lineages had developed differently, although not as contiguous as they are today; It is quite likely that they were not completely flightless at that time, as birds unable to fly are generally very small, leading to their initial phase of mass extinction due to low capacity

 It is not yet known whether giant Palaeudyptinae represents monophyletic generation, or whether giantia emerged separately in Palaeudyptinae and Anthroporinithinae - whether they were validated, or whether Palaeudyptinae contained a large range that was demarcated as generally Including nowadays
 Ancient and well-described giant penguins, the 5-foot-high Icadyptes salasi as far north as in northern Peru, were found 36 mya ago

 "as an early species, the Pygoscelis seem to have perished during the Bertonian era, but the main cause of the diversity today is range expansion and radiation, the early Miocene up to that time, about 20–15 mya ago, from the Bardigalian phase
" It may not have been before

 The emergence of the Antarctic subcontinent lineage at the end of the Bertonian coincided with the slow onset of the cooling period which eventually lasted some 3
5 million ice ages
 The main reason for the decline of habitat by the Priabonians on the Antarctic is due to the more favorable conditions in the Antarctic subfields than in the Antarctic
 Notably, the cold Antarctic Pole-like continuous current began only around 30 mya, cooling the Antarctic on the one hand and spreading Spheniscus to South America and eventually beyond

 Maharaj Nandkumar was an elite Brahmin of Bengal
 bengal ke nawab sirajuddaula ke samay main vah hughali kaa faujadaar tha
 In March 1757, when the British prepared to attack Chandannagar, a settlement of the French, Nawab Siraj-ud-daulah immediately sent Nandakumar with a large army to Chandranagar to protect the French and Indian subjects there
 lekin angrejon se rishwat paakar nandkumar angreji sena ke chandranagar pahonchte hi vahaan se hat gaya
 The French were weakened by his withdrawal and Chandranagar was easily captured by the British
 june, 1757 main rishwat ore dhokhe kaa sahaara lekar clive ke netritv main angrejon ne plasi ke yuddh main sirajuddaula ko haraakar gaddaar mir jafar ko bengal kaa nawab bana diya
 Later, the British also removed him from the throne and made his son-in-law and Mir Qasim the Nawab, on the promise of getting a lot of money
 kuch samay baad angrejon kii lut-khasot kii niti ke kaaran mir kasim ko angrejon se yuddh karne ko vivash hona padaa kintu ladaai main vah haar gaya
 When Mir Jafar again became the Nawab in 1763, he made Maharaj Nandkumar his Diwan
 nandkumar ab angrejon kii chaalon ko samaj gaya tha
 Therefore, to reinforce the Nawabi of Bengal, he advised Mir Jafar to obtain the royal decree by pleasing Emperor Shah Alam and Wazir Shuja-ud-daulah for the Bengal occupation
 aisa hone se nawab angrejon ke changul se chhootakar swadhin ho saktaa tha
 The British became irritated with this
 farvari, 1765 main mir jafar ke marane par uskaa ladkaa nawab najmuddaula gaddi par baitha
 He wanted to keep Nandkumar as his Diwan, but the British did not allow this to happen
 falat: nawab kaa ek yogya evam swamibhakt sevak uske haath se jaataa rahaa
 British Governor Warren Hastings now planned to eliminate Maharaj Nandakumar forever
 nawab najmuddaula ne mohammad raza khan naam ke vyakti ko apana naayab niyukt kiya tha
 Hastings lured Nandkumar into making him the hero of Bengal and turned him against Muhammad Raza Khan
 is laalach main nandkumar ne raja khan par gaban kaa iljaam sabit karne main madad kii thi
 But after work was over, Hastings instead of rewarding Nandkumar, became his opponent
 nandkumar ne bhi ab hestings ke khilaaf kalkatte kii concil ko ek arji pesh kii jisamen hestings par rishwat lene or jabardastee dhan vasuul karne tathaa murshidaabad ke nawab kii maan munni begum se bahut sa dhan vasuul karne aadi ke iljaam lagaae the
 Although the council members deemed these allegations to be correct, Hastings was not punished
 apitu hestings ne ulate nandkumar par yah jurm lagaaya ki paanch saal pehle san 1770 main nandkumar ne kisi divaani ke maamle main ek jaali dastavej banaaya tha
 This fraud case was conducted by a person named Mohan Prasad in the British Supreme Court of Calcutta
 court kaa mukhya nyaayadhish sar elizah impi warren hestings kaa bachapan kaa mitra tha
 The charge of forgery on Nandkumar was absolutely false, to prove that fake witnesses were put up
 vastut: angrej or visheshtya hestings nandkumar se chidhate the or use khatm karne ke liye hi yah mukadmaa chalaaya gaya tha
 The trial was held for seven days and in the end the English court convicted Nandkumar and hanged him
 5 agast san 1776 ko maharaj nandkumar ko kalkatte main phaansi par lataka diya gaya
 Nandakumar embraced death with peace and indomitable patience

 Autism is a disorder occurring during brain development that affects a person's social behavior and interaction
 hindi main ise 'aatmavimoh' or 'svaparayanata' bhi kehete hai
 The affected person behaves in a limited and repetitive manner, such as repeating the same task over and over
 yah sab bachche ke teen saal hone se pehle hi shuru ho jaataa he
 a set of these symptoms differentiates narcissism from mild narcotic spectrum disorder, such as Asperger's syndrome
 otism ek maansik rog he jiske lakshan janm se hi yaa baalyavastha se nazar aane lagaten hai
 The development of children who have this disease is unusual compared to other children
 otism hone ke koi ek kaaran nahin khoja ja sakaa he
 According to the recommendations, there can be many reasons for autism such as- aatmavimoh kaa ek majboot anuvanshik aadhaar hota he, haalanki aatmavimoh kii anuvanshiki jatil he or yah spasht nahin he ki ASD kaa kaaran bahujine samvaad he yaa durlabh utparivartan 
 In rare cases, narcissism has also been linked to factors that are responsible for birth defects
 anya prastaavit kaarnon me, bachapan ke tike, vivaadaaspad hai or iske koi vaigyanik saboot bhi nahin he
 According to a recent review, two cases per 1000 people are self-reported, while the number is close to 6 / 1000 for ASD
 ausatan ASD kaa purush:mahila anupaat 4,3:1 he
 Cases of narcissism have increased dramatically since 1980, one of the reasons being the growth in the field of medical diagnosis, but whether these cases have actually increased is an unanswered question
 aatmavimoh mastishk ke kai bhaagon ko prabhavit karata he, par iske kaarnon ko dhang se nahin samajha jaataa
 Parents usually recognize its symptoms in the first two years of their child's life
 shuruaati sangyanatmak yaa vyavhaari hastkshep, bacchon ko swayan kii dekhbhaal, saamaajik or baatcheet kaushal ke vikaas main sahaayta kar sakate hai
 There is no cure for it
 bahut kam aatistic bachche hi vayask hone par aatmanirbhar hone main safal ho pate hai
 Nowadays, a self-imposed culture has developed, in which some people believe in treatment and for some people self-immolation is a condition rather than a disorder
 aatmavimoh ko ek lakshan ke bajaay ek vishisht lakshanon ke samooh dwaara behatar samajha ja saktaa he
 Key symptoms include inability to social interaction, inability to communicate, limited hobbies, and repetitive behavior
 anya pahaluon me, jaise khaane kaa ajeeb tarika haalaanki aam he lekin nidaan ke liye aavashyak nahin he
 Social development In addition to being incapable of self-immolation, humans are unable to understand the intentions of other people, so people often do not take them seriously
 saamaajik asamarthataayen bachapan se shuru ho kar vyask hone tak chalati hai
 Autistic children tend to be indifferent to social activities, do not look at people, do not smile, and most commonly do not react: even when they are called
 otistic shishuon kaa vyavhaar to or chaunkaane vaala hota he, wo aankh nahin milaate hai or apni baat kehane ke liye wo aksar duusare vyakti kaa haath choote or hilaate hai
 Children between three and five years of age usually do not display social understanding, do not respond at all to calls, are insensitive to feelings, silent behaviorists and turn to others
 iske baavjood wo apni praathmik dekhbhaal karne vaale vyakti se jude hote he
 Children with narcissism exhibit less attuned protection than normal children, although this symptom disappears in children with high brain development or who have low ASD
 ASD se grasit bade bachche or vyask chehron or bhaawanaaon ko pahchaanane ke pareekshan main bahut bura pradarshan karte hai
 Contrary to popular belief, autistic children do not like to be alone
 dost bananaa or dosti banaae rakhana aatistic bachche ke liye aksar mushkil sabit hota he
 For them, the quality of friendship matters not the number of friends
 ASD se peedit logon ke gusse or hinsa ke bare main kaaphi kisse hai lekin vaigyanik adhyayan bahut kam hai
 These limited statistics show that only children with narcissism are aggressive or aggressive
 dominic at al, ne 67 ASD se grast bacchon ke mata-pita kaa saakshaatkaar liya or nishkarsh nikaala ki, do tihaai bacchon ke jivan main aanse daur aate hai jab unka vyavhaar bahut bura ho jaataa he jabaki ek tihaai bachche aakraamak ho jate hai, aksar bhashaa ko thik se na jaanane vaale bachche nakhrel hote hai
 There are some major differences between normal children and autistic children in childhood, on the basis of which this condition can be identified as- ek tihaai se lekar aadhe otistik vyaktiyon main apane dainik jivan kii jaruraton ko puraa karne ke laayak bhashaa bodh tathaa bolne kii kshamta viksit nahin ho paati
 Shortcomings in communication are visible in the first year of life, including late speaking, unusual gestures, sluggish response, and a lack of cohesion in conversations with your foster
 duusare or tisare saal main, otistic bachche kam bolte hai, saath hi unka shabd sanchay or shabd sangyojan bhi vistrut nahin hota
 Their expressions often do not match their spoken words
 aatistic bacchon main anurodh karne yaa anubhavon ko baantne kii sambhaavna kam hoti he or unamem bas dusron kii baaten ko dohraane kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he 
 Functional communication requires joint attention, and this combined attention deficit distinguishes ASD infants from others: Example: Instead of the object they are pointing at, they might see the hand they are pointing to
 And they are failing to do so continuously
 otistic bacchon ko kalpanasheel khelon main or bhashaa seekhney main kathinaayee ho sakati he
 No particular repetition is related to narcissism, but narcissism is responsible for these behaviors
 otism ko sheeghra pahchaanana or manorog visheshgy se turant paraamarsh hi iskaa sabase pehla ilaaj he
 Contact a psychiatrist, psychologist, or trained special educator if symptoms of autism appear
 otism ek aaajeevan rahane vaali avasthaa he jiske purna upachaar ke liye koi dawa kii khoj zaari he, atah iske ilaaj ke liye yahan-vahaan na bhataken va bina samay gavaayen iske bare main jaankaree praapt karen
 Autism is a type of developmental disease that cannot be cured completely, but the patient can be taught a lot through proper training and counseling, which helps him to take care of himself in his daily life
 otism se grasit 70% vayaktiyon main maansik mandatha paayi jaati he jiske kaaran vah ek saamaanya jivan jeene main puri tarah se samarth nahin ho pate, parantu yadi maansik mandatha bahut aghik na ho to otism se grasit vyakti bahut kuch sikh paata he
 Sometimes some such abilities are also seen in these children which are far from the understanding and reach of normal people
 otism se grasit bachche ko nimnlikhit tareekon se madad di ja sakati he- If the child does one behavior again and again, to prevent it, engage him in some activities that keep him busy so that they do not repeat the behavior, sudakshin kamboj kaa raja tha

 Early studies on changes in cognition with age have generally found a decrease in intelligence with aging, but these studies were emotion-oriented rather than ambitious, and therefore the results obtained were a true example of decline rather than a group-specific one

 This finding is generally more convincing for men than women, although the gender pattern is not universal in all studies, and some results suggest gender-based differences in only certain causes of mortality and self-assessment of health in certain age groups Some appear for specific sub-groups

 Earthquake or earthquake is the shaking of the Earth's surface
 yah prithvi ke sthalmandal main urja ke achaanak mukt ho jane ke kaaran utpann hone vaali bhukampi tarangon kii vajah se hota he
 Earthquakes can be very violent and have the ability to cause people to collapse and hurt an entire city in a few moments
 bukamp kaa maapan bhukampamapi yantron ke saath kara jaataa he, jo seismograph bhi kehalaata he
 The moment magnitude magnitude of an earthquake is traditionally measured, or the relative and obsolete Richter magnitude is taken
 3 yaa us se kam richter pariman kii tivrata kaa bukamp aksar agochar hota he, jabaki 7 richter kii tivrata kaa bukamp bade kshetron main gambhir kshati kaa kaaran hota he
 The intensity of the shaking is measured on the developed mercury scale
 prithvi kii sataha par, bukamp apane aap ko, bhoomi ko hilaakar yaa visthapit kar ke prakat karata he
 When a major earthquake occurs in the epicenter offshore, it causes a substantial amount of displacement at the seashore, which is the cause of the tsunami
 bukamp ke jatke kabhi-kabhi bhuskhalan or jwalamukhi gatividhiyon ko bhi paidaa kar sakate hai
 In the most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event, a natural event]) or an event caused by humans — which produce seismic waves)
 aksar bukamp bhugarbheey dosha ke kaaran aate hai, baari maatra main gas pravaas, prithvi ke bheetar mukhyatah gahari methane, jwalamukhi, bhuskhalan or nabhikeey parikshan aise mukhya dosha hai
 The starting point of earthquake is called center or hypo center
 shabd uparicendre kaa arth he, bhoomi ke str par thik iske upar kaa bindu
 In the case of, many earthquakes originate away from the plate boundary and are related to stresses developed over a wide area of deformation, this deformation is caused by major irregularities in the fault zone
 Northridge bukamp aise hi ek kshetra main andh dabaav gati se sambandhit tha
 Another example is the obliquely concentric plate boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plate where it passes through the northwestern part of the Zagros Mountains

 This is demonstrated by the central mechanism of earthquake
 sabhi tectonic plates main aantarik dabaav kshetra hote hai jo apni padosi platon ke saath antarkriya ke kaaran yaa talchhati ladaan yaa utraai ke kaaran hote hai
 
these stresses can be a sufficient cause of failure at the edge of present fault surfaces, these give rise to interplate earthquakes
 adhikansh tectonic bukamp 10 kilometre se adhik kii gaharaai se utpann nahin hote hai
 Earthquakes that occur at a depth of less than 70 kilometers are called 'shallow-center' earthquakes, while earthquakes occurring at depths between 70-300 kilometers are called 'mid-central' or 'inter-central' earthquakes
