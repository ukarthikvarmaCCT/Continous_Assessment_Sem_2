 kyonki mere paanch bacchon kii maut ke hosh [31 Maharishi Bhrigu was born in 5000 BC in brahmaloka-susha Nagar
 inke pardada kaa naam marichi rishi tha
 Grandfather's name was Kashyapa Rishi, grandmother's name was Aditi
 inke pita prachetha-vidhaataa jo brahmalok ke raja banane ke baad prajapita brahma kahalaaye
 His parents were the eldest son of aditi-kashyap
 maharishi bhriguji kii mata kaa naam virani devi tha
 They were two brothers siblings from their parents
 aapke bade bhai kaa naam angira rishi tha
 Whose sons were Brihaspati who is known as the priest-goddess of the gods
 maharishi bhrigu dwaara rachit jyotish granth ‘bhrigu samhita’ ke locarpan evam ganga sarayu nadiyon ke sangam ke avasar par jeevandaayini ganga nadi ke sangrakshan or yaajik parampara se maharishi bhrigu ne apane shishy darder ke sammaan main dadri mela prarambh kiya
 The mention of two wives of Maharishi Bhrigu is found in the Aarash texts
 inaki pehali patni daityon ke adhipati hiranyakashyap kii putree divya thi
 From whom your two sons were born kavya-venus and tvashta-vishwakarma respectively
 sushanagar main paidaa hue maharishi bhrigu ke donon putr vilakshan pratibha ke dhani the
 Elder sons kavya-venus were astrologers, masters of astrology, sacrificial rituals

 He became famous in the world as Shukracharya
 duusare putr twashta-vishwakarma vaastu ke nipun shilpkaar hue
 You were known as 'maya' in the matriarch monster
 apni paarangat shilp dakshata se ye bhi jagadkhyat hue
 Maharishi Bhrigu's second wife was Poulami, daughter of the sage Pulom Rishi
 inase bhi do putron chyavan or richik paidaa hue
 The elder son Chyavan was married by Muniver to Sukanya, the daughter of King Sharyati of Gujarat Bharaonch
 bhargav chyavan or sukanya ke vivaah ke saath hi bhargavon kaa himalay ke dakshin padaarpan hua
 Chyavan Rishi became the king of the Gulf of Khambhat and the region came to be known as bhrigukchha-bhrigu Kshetra
 aaj bhi bhadauch main narmada ke tat par bhrigu mandir bana he
 Maharishi Bhrigu married his second son, Ritchik, along with Satyavati, daughter of Kanyakubjapati Kaushik King Gadhi, by giving one thousand Shyamakarna horses in dowry
 ab bhargav richik bhi himalay ke dakshin gadhipuri aa gayi
 Many of the plot of Maharishi Bhrigu's arrival in this liberated area are found in the scriptures
 puranic, aitihaasik aakhyaanon ke anusaar brahma-prachetha putr bhrigu dwaara himalay ke dakshin daitya, daanav or maanav jatiyon ke raajaaon ke saath vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kar meljol badhaane se himalay ke uttar kii dev, gandharv, yaksha jatiyon ke nrivanshon main aakrosh punap rahaa tha
 All the people were blaming Vishnu, the youngest brother of Brahma, the patron of the gods
 duusare barhon adityon main bhargavon kaa prabhutv badhata ja rahaa tha
 Meanwhile, the great demon Hiranyakashyap of Maharishi Bhrigu invaded the kingdoms north of the Himalayas
 jisase maharishi bhrigu ke parivaar main vivaad hone laga
 Maharishi Bhrigu was taking the side of his brother by saying that extending the state boundary is the king's religion
 is vivaad main vishnu ji ne unki pehali patni, hiranyakashyap kii putree divya devi ko maar daalaa
 Due to this, Maharishi Bhrigu gave a kick to Shri Vishnu
 is vivaad kaa nipataara maharishi bhrigu ke pardada or vishnu ji ke dada marichi muni ne is nirnay ke saath kiya ki bhrigu himalay ke dakshin jaakar rahe
 Devganas will bear the responsibility of upbringing with respect to the sons born to their Divya Devi
 parivaar kii pratishtha-maryaada kii raksha ke liye bhrigu ji ko yah bhi aadesh mila ki vah shri hari vishnu kii aalochana nahin karenge
 In this way, Maharishi Bhrigu came to Gadhipuri with his second son Paulmi from Sushanagar to his younger son Ritchik
 maharishi bhrigu ke is kshetra main aane doosraa aakhyaan kuch dharmik granthon, puraanon main miltaa he
 Maharishi Bhrigu is the son of pracheta-brahma, according to the narratives scattered in the sections of Vishnu Purana, Agni Purana, Srimad Bhagwat, the fourth wing of Goddess Bhagwat, he was married to Khyati, daughter of Daksha Prajapati
 jinase inke do putr kavy-shukr or twashta tathaa ek putree ‘shri’ lakshmi kaa janm hua

 She brought the dead soldiers of the army of demons alive with her power
 jisase naaraaz hokar srihari vishnu ne shukracharya kii mata, bhriguji kii patni khyaati kaa sir apane sudarshan chakra se kaat diya
 On knowing about the murder of his wife, Maharishi Bhrigu curses Lord Vishnu that you will have to be born again and again from the stomach of a woman
 uske baad maharishi apni patni khyaati ko apane yogabal se jivit kar ganga tat par aa jate hai, tamasa nadi kii sristi karte hai
 According to the legend of the epilogue section of the Padma Purana, in the yagna taking place at Mandarachal, there was a dispute among sages and sages who appointed Maharishi Bhrigu as the tester to test the gods
 tridevon kii pariksha lene ke kram main maharishi bhrigu sabase pehle bhagwaan shankar ke kailash pahuche us samay bhagwaan shankar apni patni sati ke saath vihaar kar rahe the
 Nandi etc
 Rudras stopped Maharishi at the entrance itself
 inke dwaara bhagwaan shankar se milane kii hath karne par rudraganon ne maharishi ko apamaanit bhi kar diya
 The enraged Maharishi Bhrigu declared Lord Shankar as Tamoguni and cursed him to be worshiped in the linga
 yahan se maharishi bhrigu brahmalok brahmaji ke paas pahunche
 Brahma was staying in his court
 sabhi devgan unke samaksh baithe hue the
 Brahmaji did not even ask Bhrigu to sit
 tab maharishi bhrigu ne brahmaji ko rajoguni ghoshit karte hue apoojya hone kaa shaap diya
 Maharishi Vishnulok walked in disgusted with the insults and insults found in Kailash and Brahmaloka
 bhagwaan srihari vishnu ksheer sagar main sarpakar sundar nauka par apni patni lakshmi-shri ke saath vihaar kar rahe the
 At that time Shri Vishnu ji was sleeping
 maharishi bhriguji ko laga ki hamen aata dekh vishnu sone kaa naatak kar rahe hai
 He struck his right leg on the chest of Shri Vishnu
 maharishi ke is ashisht aacharan par vishnupriya lakshmi jo srihari ke charan dabaa rahi thi, kupit ho uthi
 But Shrivishnu ji grabbed Maharishi's leg and said Bhagavan! My hard chest did not hurt your soft phase
 maharishi bhrigu lajjit bhi hue or prasann bhi, unhone srihari vishnu ko tridevon main shreshth satoguni ghoshit kar diya
 In this examination of the trinity, where a great learning is hidden
 vahiin ek bahut badi kootneeti bhi chhipi thi
 This incident created a proverb
 kshamaa badan ko chahie, chhotan ko utpaat
 Ka Hari Gaya, as Bhrigu Kari Kata
 
 The diplomacy in this event was that all the castes under the leadership of Shri Hari Vishnu were progressing to become civilized, cultured by being the organization of ethnics of the north of the Himalayas
 vahi himalay ke dakshin kaa nrivansh samudaay jinhen daitya-daanav, marut-rudra aadi naamon se janaa jaataa tha
 Even after being diligent, she was leading an unorganized, unruly life
 ye jatiyaan rudra shankar ko hi apana nayak-devtaa maanati thi

 himalay ke dakshin main devkul nayak vishnu ko pratishthapit karne ke liye maharishi bhrigu hi sabase upyukt madhyam the
 He had a wife from Daityakul, another from the demon clan, and his sons Shukracharyas, tvashta-maya-vishwakarma and Chyavan in Bhrigukchha and Ritik in Gadhipuri were highly respected
 is tridev pariksha ke baad himalay ke dakshin main srihari vishnu kii pratishtha sthapit hone lagi
 Especially in the consecration of kings, taking the name of Shri Vishnu was considered to be a blessing and recognition of the Gods of the Himalayas
 puraanon main varnit aakhyaan ke anusaar tridevon kii pariksha main vishnu vaksh par pad prahaar karne vaale maharishi bhrigu ko dandacharya marichi rishi ne dand diya
 For which Bhriguji got a blanket in a dry bamboo stick and the deer fell from your waist
 vahi aap vishnu sahastra naam kaa jap karenge tab aapke is paap kaa mochan hoga
 While walking from Mandarachal, when Maharishi Bhrigu reached the Ganga coast of the liberated area, his deer fell and the rod exploded into a stick
 jahaan unhone tapasya karnaa prarambh kar diya
 In the course of time, this land came to be known as Bhrigukshetra in the name of Maharishi
 maharishi bhrigu jivan se jude aitihaasik, puranic or dharmik sabhi pakshon par prakaash daalane ke peeche meraa sidhaa mantavy he ki pathak swavivek kaa prayog kar saken
 The descriptions of our mystics are abundant in our religious texts, but with the same abundance, imaginary incidents have also been added to it
 unke jivan ko mahimamandit karne ke liye hamaare patuvidwaan unki aitihaasikta se khilwaad kiye hai, jiske kaaran vaishvik str par anek baar apmanjanak sthiti utpann ho jaati he
 Maharishi Bhrigu cleaned the forests here after coming to this land
 yahan maatr pashuon ke akhet par jivan yaapan kar rahe jansamanya ko kheti karnaa sikhaaya
 Here he established the Gurukul and taught the people to read and write
 us kalkhand main is bhu-bhaag ko narbhakshi maanvon kaa nivas mana jaataa tha
 The task of making them cultured, cultured human beings was done by Maharishi
 maharishi bhrigu ke pariwarik jivan se aparichit jan bhi maharishi dwaara pranit jyotish-khagol ke mahaan granth bhrigu samhita ke bare main jaanate he
 Many books with this name still appear to be sold here from literature vendors
 maharishi ne bhrigu samhita granth kii rachana apni dirghakaalin nivas kii karm bhoomi vimukt bhoomi baliya main hi kiya tha
 There are two things to note in this context
 pehali baat yah he ki apni janmabhumi brahmalok main nivas kaal main unka jivan jhanjhawaton se bharaa hua tha
 Maharishi, distressed by the death of his wife Divya Devi and expelled from the land of birth after the examination of the trinity, had the opportunity to live peacefully at the same time when he came to the liberated land
 bhrigukachha gujarat main pahuchane ke samay tak unki khyaati chaturdik fail chuki thi
 Because by that time, his Bhrigu Samhita had also gained fame and his Aryavart had also come to know about the confluence of ganga-sarayu by his disciple Dardar in Bhrigukshtra
 aakhyaanon ke anusaar khambhat kii khadi main maharishi ke pahuchane par unka rajasi abhinandan kiya gaya tha, tathaa vaidic vidwaan brahmanon ne swastivachan karte hue unhe atmagyaani jyotish ke prakand pandit ke rup main unki abhyarthna kii thi
 This proves that the Bhrigu Samhita was composed by Maharishi after his expulsion from Sushanagar and before going to Bhrigukchha in Gujarat
 maharishi kii is samhita dwaara kisi bhi jataka ke teen janmon kaa fal nikaala ja saktaa he
 Predictions of life and agriculture were also predicted through this scientific treatise of Vedic mathematics based on the planets and constellations like Sun, Moon, Mars, Buddha, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, etc
, which control this universe
 maharishi ke kalkhand main kaagaj or chapai kii suvidha uplabdh nahin thi
 Richa was memorized and its practical information was given to the disciples through slokas
 kaalaantar main jab likhane kii vidha viksit hui or uske sansaadhan masi bhojaptr taadptr aadi kaa vikaas hua, tab kuch vidwaanon ne in richaon ko lipibaddh karne kaa kaam kiya

 paal samrajya Since the time of Harsha, Kannauj was considered a symbol of the dominance of northern India
 baad main yah sthaan dilli ne praapt kar liya
 The foundation of the Pala empire was laid by a king named 'gopal' in 750 AD
 bataaya jaataa he ki us kshetra main faili ashaanti ko dabaane ke liye kuch pramukh logon ne usko raja ke rup main chunaa
 Thus the election of the king was an unprecedented event
 iskaa arth shaayad yah he ki gopal us kshetra ke sabhi mahatvapurn logon kaa samarthan praapt karne main safal ho sakaa or isse use apni sthiti majboot karan main kaafii sahaayta mili
 The eldest emperor of the Pala dynasty was 'dharmapala', the son of 'gopal'
 isane 770 se lekar 810 i
 tak rajya kiya
 The struggle for the dominion of Kannauj began in this reign
 is samay ke shaskaon kii yah manyata thi ki jo kannauj kaa shaasha hoga, use sampoorn uttari bharat ke samraat ke rup main sweekaar kar liya jayega
 Control over Kannauj also meant that the ruler would also control the upper Ganges valley and its vast natural resources
 pehle pratihaar shaasha 'vatsaraj' ne dharmpal ko parajeet kar kannauj par adhikaar praapt kar liya
 But at this time, the Rashtrakuta emperor 'dhruva', who was fighting the Pratiharas for dominance over Gujarat and Malwa, invaded northern India
 kaafii taiyaariyon ke baad usne narmada paar kar aadhunik jhansi ke nikat vatsaraj ko yuddh main parajeet kiya
 He then went ahead and defeated Dharmapala in the Ganges valley
 in vijayon ke baad yah rashtrakut samraat 790 main dakshin laut aayaa
 It seems that it had no special desire to gain authority over Kannauj and only wanted to abolish the power of the Pratiharas to subjugate Gujarat and Malwa
 vah apane donon lakshyon main safal rahaa
 On the other hand, due to the weakening of Pratiharas, Dharampal also benefited
 vah apni haar se sheeghra uth khadaa hua or usne apane ek vyakti ko kannauj ke singhaasana par baitha diya
 Here he organized a huge court
 jisamen aas-pados ke kshetron ke kai choti raajaaon ne bhaag liya
 These included the kings of Gandhara, Madra, East Rajasthan and Malwa
 is prakaar dharmpal ko sachche arthon main uttarapathaswamin kaha ja saktaa he
 The Pratihara Empire suffered a major setback and Vatsaraj's name was not heard after being defeated by the Rashtrakutas
 vishay suchi There was a mutual struggle between these three kingdoms for nearly 200 years
 ek baar phir kannauj ke prabhutv ke liye dharmpal ko pratihaar samraat 'nagabhatta' dwitiya se yuddh karnaa padaa
 An inscription has been found near Gwalior, written 50 years after Nagabhatta's death and which discusses his victory
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki nagabhatta dwitiya ne malwa tathaa madhya bharat ke kuch hisson par vijay praapt kii tathaa 'turushk tathaa saindhav' ko parajeet kiya jo shaayad sindh main arab shaasha or unke turki sipaahi the
 He also defeated the Bang Samrat, who was probably Dharmapala, and drove him to Munger
 lekin ek baar phir rashtrakut bich main aa gaye
 The Rashtrakuta emperor Govind III laid his feet in northern India and Nagabhatta II had to retreat
 bundelkhand ke nikat ek yuddh main govind tritiy ne use parajeet kar diya
 But once again the Rashtrakuta emperor returned to the south after gaining authority over Malwa and Gujarat
 ye ghatnaayen lagbhag 806 se 870 i
 ke bich hui
 When the Pala rulers failed to establish their dominion over Kannauj and the upper Ganges valley, they turned their attention to other regions
 dharmpal ke putr devpal ne, jo 810 i
 main singhaasana par baitha or 40 varshon tak rajya kiya, pragajyotishpur tathaa urisa ke kuch kshetron main apana prabhaav qaayam kar liya
 Some parts of Nepal were also under the Pala emperors
 devpal kii mrityu ke baad paal samrajya kaa vighatan ho gaya
 But at the end of the tenth century, it rose again and it remained in effect till the thirteenth century
 arab vyapaaree suleman ke anusaar According to 1 Arab merchant Suleman: - The rulers of the early Pala dynasty established their dominance over the eastern regions of northern India from the middle of the eighth century to the tenth century, that is, for about 200 years
 dasvin shatabdi ke madhya main bharat aane vaale ek arab vyapaaree suleman ne paal samrajya kii shakti or samruddhi kii charchaa kii he
 He called the Pala kingdom as 'ruhama' and said that the Pala ruler and his neighboring states, Pratiharas and Rashtrakutas used to fight, but the Pala regime's forces were larger than the armies of both his enemies
 suleman ne bataaya he ki paal shaasha 50 hazaar haathiyon ke saath yuddh main jaataa tha or 10 se 15 hazaar vyakti keval uske sainikon ke kapadon ko dhone ke liye niyukt the
 From this, his army can be estimated
 paal vansh ke bare main hamen tibeti granthon se bhi pataa chalata he, yadhyapi yah satarahavin shatabdi main likhe gaye
 According to them, the Pala rulers patronized and promoted Buddhism and knowledge
 nalanda vishvavidhyalay ko, jo saare purvi kshetra main vikhyath he, dharmpal ne punah jivit kiya or uske kharche ke liye 200 gaanvon kaa daan diya
 He also founded Vikramshila University
 jisaki khyaati keval nalanda ke baad he
 It was situated on a hill top near the Ganges in Magadha
 paal shaskaon ne kai baar viharon kaa bhi nirmaan kiya jisamen badi sankhya main buddha rahete the
 Pala Ruler and Tibet paal shaskaon ke tibet ke saath bhi bade nikat ke saanskrithik sambandh the
 He invited the famous Buddhist scholars Santarkshit and Dipakar to come to Tibet and there they introduced a new form of Buddhism
 nalanda tathaa vikramshil vishvavidhyalayon main badi sankhya main tibeti vidwaan buddha adhyayan ke liye aate the
 The Pala rulers had economic and trade relations with Southeast Asia
 dakshin purv asia ke saath unka vyapaar unke liye bada laabhadaayak tha or isse paal samrajya kii samruddhi badi
 The Buddhist rulers of the Shailendra dynasty, who ruled Malaya, Java, Sumatra and the neighboring islands, sent their ambassadors to the palace and sought permission to establish a monastery at Nalanda
 unhone paal shaasha devpal se is math ke kharch ke liye paanch graamon kaa anudaan maanga
 Devpal accepted his request
 isse hamen in donon ke nikat sambandhon ke bare main pataa chalata he
 Dharmapala - After Gopal his son Dharmapala ascended the throne in 770 AD
 dharmpal ne 40 varshon tak shashan kiya
 Dharmapala was involved in a three-party struggle for Kannauj
 usne kannauj kii gaddi se indraudh ko haraakar chakrayudh ko asin kiya
 After sitting the throne on the throne, he organized a grand court and assumed the title of Uttarapath Swamin
 dharmpal buddha dharmavalambi tha
 He built many monasteries and Buddhist viharas
 usne bhagalpur jile main sthit vikramshila vishvavidhyalay kaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 a hundred villages were donated for his care
 ullekhneey he ki pratihaar raja nagabhatta dwitiya evam rashtrakut raja dhruv ne dharmpal ko parajeet kiya tha
 Devpal - After Dharmapala, his son Devpal ascended the throne
 isane apane pita ke anusaar vistaaravaadi niti kaa anusaran kiya
