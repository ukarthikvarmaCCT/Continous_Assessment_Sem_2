1 called Kutsayana Stotra

2 isaki vyakhya karata he
 The Sarveshvarist Kutsayana Stotra says that our soul is Brahman and this ultimate truth or God is present within all beings

2, Vishnu and Shiva are compared to the concept of virtue

 This chapter of the Maitri Upanishad claims that the universe emerged from darkness
 jo pehle aaveg ke rup main ubhara tha par baad main pavitrataa or achchhai main badal gaya
 Then it compares Brahma to Rajas in this way: phir uskaa wo bhaag jo tamas he, he pavitra gyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon, rudra he
 The part of him who is Rajas, o students of sacred knowledge, is Brahma
 uskaa wo bhaag jo satva he, he pavitra gyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon, vishnu he
 Actually he was one, he became three, became eight, eleven, twelve and numerous

 yah puraana kahata he ki brahma nidra main hai, galati karte hai or ve brahmand kii rachana ke samay asthaayee rup se aksham the
 When he became aware of his confusion and sleep, he performed penance like an ascetic, embraced Hari in his heart, then he came to know the beginning and end of the universe, and then his creative powers were revived
 bhagwat puraana kahata he ki iske baad unhone prakruti or purush: ko jod kar chakachaundh kar dene vaali praaniyon kii vividhta banaai
 The Bhagavata Purana also describes the creation of Maya as the work of Brahma
 iskaa srijan unhone keval srijan karne kii khatir kiya
 From Maya everything was colored by good and evil, matter and spirituality, beginning and end
 puraana samay banane vaale devtaa ke rup main brahma kaa varnan karte hai

 iske baad paanch lakh rupee se yang india company banaai, jisamen sonia or rahul kii 38-38 pratishat hissedari he
 The remaining stake is held by Congress leaders Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes
 iske baad ke 10-10 rupee ke nau karod share yang india ko de die gaye or iske badale yang india ko congress kaa rin chukaana tha
 Young India got 99 percent shares of Associate Journal Limited with nine crore shares
 iske baad congress party ne 90 karod kaa rin bhi maaf kar diya

 nyaayadhish ne kaha ki baharhaal, kisi bhi surat main yah nahin kaha ja saktaa he ki sambandhit shikaayat ke aaropee ke taur par yachikakartaon ko talab karne ke liye koi maamla nahin banataa
 The questionable conduct of the petitioners to know the truth needs to be properly investigated at the stage of the charge and hence these criminal proceedings cannot be revoked at this initial stage
 nyaayadhish ne yah bhi raay vyakt kii ki yachikakartaon par lage aaropon kii gambhirtha main ek rashtriya raajnneetik dal se judaa dhokhadhadi kaa abhas hota he or isliye yachikakartaon par lage gambhir aaropon par uchit tareeke se gaur kiye jane kii jarurat he

 The Vaishnavi movement gave rise to provincial literature
 shankar dev ne apni lambii jivan-yatra main is andolan ko swarchit kavy, natya va geeton se jivit rakhaa
 The history of Assamese elegant and written literature is divided into five periods: adhyatan uplabdh saamagree ke aadhaar par hem saraswati or hariver wipro asamiya ke praarambhik kavi maane ja sakate hai
 Hem Saraswati's "prahladcharitra" is considered the first written text of Assamese
 ye donon kavi kamataatur ke shaasha durlainarayan ke ashrith the
 There was also a third famous poet Kabiratna Saraswati, who wrote "jayadrathavadha"
 parantu vaishnavapoorvakaal ke sabase prasiddh kavi madhav kandali hue, jinhone raja mahamaniky ke aashray main rahakar apni rachanaayen kin
 Madhava Kandali's translation of the Ramayana gained special fame
 sanskrit shabdasmooh ko asamiya main roopanrit karnaa kavi kii vishesh kala thi
 Some of the other lyrical works of this period are notable
 in rachanaaon main tatkaaleen lokmanas vishesh rup se pratifalit hua
 Legislations of Tantra Mantra, Mansapooja etc
 have become more popular in the works of this class
 is kaal kii purvavarti rachanaaon main vishnu se sambhddha kuch devataaon ko mahatv diya gaya tha
 But later, the worship of Vishnu was particularly revered
 sthiti ke is parivartan main asamiya ke mahaan kavi or dharmasudharak shankardev i
 kaa yoga basase adhik tha
 Most of Shankaradeva's compositions are based on Bhagavat Purana and his view is called Bhagavati Dharma
 asamiya janajivan or samskruti ko uske vishisht rup main dhaalane kaa shrey shankardev ko hi diya jaataa he
 Therefore some critics do not want to restrict his personality as a poet only
 ve mulat: unhen dharmik sudhaarak ke rup main maanate hai
 Sri Krishna was the main refuge of Shankardev's devotion
 unki lagbhag 30 rachanaayen hai, jinamein se "kirtanghosh" unki sarvotkrisht kriti he
 Sankardev is also the initiator of the famous drama form of Assamese literature "ankiya Nataka"
 unke naatakon main gadhy or padya kaa baraabar mishran miltaa he
 Maithili's influence on the language of these plays
 "ankiya naatak" ke padyansh ko "vargit" kaha jaataa he, jisaki bhashaa pramukhat: brajabuli he
 Apart from Shankardev, the other important poet of this era was his disciple Madhavdev
 unka vyaktitv bahumukhi tha
 Apart from being a poet, he was also a Sanskrit scholar, playwright, musician and preacher
 "namghosha" inaki vishisht kriti he
 "chordhara" is the more famous composition in Shankardev's plays

 Yashvarnan of kings became a major duty of the poets of this period
 vaise bhi ahom raajaaon main itihaslekhan kii parampara pehle se hi chali aati thi
 Yashvarnan's tendency of poets was diverted by the sheltering kings
 pehle to ahom bhashaa ke itihaas granthon kaa anuwaad asamiya main kiya gaya or phir moulik rup se buranjiyon kaa srijan hone laga
 "buranji" is basically a tie word, meaning "storehouse of unknown stories"
 in buranjiyon ke madhyam se assam pradesh ke madhyayug kaa kaaphi vyavasthit itihaas uplabdh he
 The names of Kamrup Buranji, Kachari Buranji, Ahom Buranji, Jayanti Buranji, Beliyar Buranji are relatively more famous under Buranji literature
 in buranji granthon ke atirikt rajwanshon kii vistrut vanshawaliyaan bhi is kaal main hui
 In the era of useful literature, science related texts like astrology, mathematics, medicine etc
 were created
 kala tathaa nrity vishyak pustaken bhi likhi gayi
 The tendency towards secularism, nurtured by royalty, can be clearly seen at the root of all this versatile literature
 is kaal main hindi ke do sufi kaavyon ke kathankon ke aadhaar par do asamiya kavy likhe gaye
 But basically this era is the development of prose
 anya anek prantiy bhashaaon ke sahitya ke samaan asamiya main bhi aadhunik kaal kaa prarambh angreji shashan ke saath joda jaataa he
 1826 AD is the date of commencement of English rule in Assam
 is yug main swadeshi bhavanon ke daman tathaa saamaajik vishmata ne mukhya rup se lekhakon ko prarena di
 From 1838 AD, foreign missionaries also started their work and made Assamese the medium of publicity
 falat: asamiya bhashaa ke vikaas main in mishnariyon dwaara parichaalit vyavasthit dhang ke mudran tathaa prakaashan se bhi ek str par sahaayta mili
 Assamese writers were influenced by the study of English and European literature in the era of English rule
 kuch paashchaatya adarsh bangala ke madhyam se bhi apanaae gaye
 The name of Anandaram Tekial Phukan is the most important of the early writers of this era
 anya lekhakon main hemchandra barua, gunabhiram barua tathaa satyanash boda ke naam ullekhneey hai
 The original form of Assamese literature was produced mainly by three authors
 ye lekhak the chandrakumar agarwal, lakshminath bejbarua tathaa hemchandra goswami 
 While studying in Calcutta, these three friends established a monthly paper called "jonaki" in 1889
 is patrika ko centre banaakar dhire-dhire ek saahitiyik samudaay uth khadaa hua jise baad main jonaki samooh kaha gaya
 Most authors in this class were influenced by English Romanticism
 20veen sadi ke prarambh ke in lekhakon main lakshminath bejbarua bahumukhi pratibhasampann the
 His compilation titled "assamese Literary Chaneki" is particularly famous
 asamiya sahitya main unhone kahani tathaa lalit niabandh ke bich ke ek sahitya rup ko adhik prachlit kiya
 The comedic works of Bezbarua gained considerable popularity
 isiilie use "rasraj" kii oopaadhi di gai
 Kamalakant Bhattacharya, Raghunath Chaudhary, Nalinibala Devi, Ambikagiri Raychaudhuri, Phukan etc
 are considered important among other poets in this era
 maphizuddin ahamed kii kavitaayen sufi dharmasadhana se prerit hai
 In the field of prose, particularly Kathasahthya, two writers Padyanath Gosai Barua and Rajinikanth Bardolai are considered important for their historical novels and plays in the late 19th century
 jonaki samudaay ke samanaantar jin gadhylekhakon ne sahityasrujan kiya unamem se venudhar rajkhova tathaa sharachchandra goswami ke naam vishesh rup se ullekhneey hai
 Sharachandra Goswami's talent was multifaceted, but his fame is mainly about stories
 kahani ke kshetra main lakshmidhar sharma, binaa barua, krishna bhuyaan aadi ne pranay sambandhi nae abhipraayon ke kuch prayog kiye
 Laxminath Phukan is remembered for his comic stories
 kathasahitya ke atirikt naatak ke kshetra main atulachandra hajarika tathaa jyotiprasad agarwal kaa kaary adhik mahatvapurn he
 From the point of view of review and research, the work of Ambikanath Bara, Vanikant Kakati, Kaliram Medhi, Viranchi Barua and Dimbeshwar Niyog is notable
 asamiya sahitya ke aadhunik kaal main patr patrikaon kaa madhyam bhi kaaphi prachlit hua
 Of these, "arunodaya", "jonaki", "boli", "aavahana", "jayanti", and "pachhova" have done quite useful work in various fields
 nae prakaar kaa sahityasrujan pramukhat: "ramadhenu" ko centre banaakar hua he
 In this era, western effects have come in more healthy and balanced form
 iliyat tathaa unke sahyogi angreji kaviyon se nae asamiya lekhakon ko pramukhat: prerana mili he
 The trend of these new experiments can be seen not only in poetry, but also in narrative and drama
 samajashastreey tathaa manovaigyanik donon hi prakaar kii samasyaon kaa nae lekhakon ne uthaaya he
 Their craft uses are also no less important
 pracheen assam kii sahitya-ruchi-sampannataa kaa pataa tatkaaleen tamrapatron se chalata he
 Similarly, there is an ancient reference to the book production there, according to which Kumar Bhaskaravarman had presented many books written in beautiful script to his friend Kannaujasamrat Harshavardhana

 The tradition of music has been going on in Assam since very ancient times

 These songs are associated with religious occasions, pickles and rituals
 kuch lokgaathaon main rajkumaar nayakon ke aakhyaan bhi milte hai
 The importance of philosophical post in this period before the emergence of elegant literature is extraordinary
 uske kathanon ko vedavaky sangya di gai he
 This tradition of postal texts goes as far as Bengal and Bihar
 assam ke praaia: prayek parivaar main kuch samay purv tak in dakvachanon kaa ek hastlikhit sankalan rahata tha
 Assam's ancient name "kamarupa" appears that there has been a tradition of tantra mantra since very ancient times
 in guhyacharon se sambhddha anek prakaar ke mantra milte hai jinase bhashaa tathaa sahitya vishyak praarambhik avasthaa kaa kuch parichay miltaa he
 Many of the Siddhas, the authors of "chariyapad", are said to have a very close relationship with Kamrup, which seems quite natural given the Tantric tradition of this region
