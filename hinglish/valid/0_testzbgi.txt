 The Kohinoor is a 105-carat diamond that was once the world's largest known diamond
 kaha jaataa he ki yah hira bharat kii golkunda kii khan se nikaala gaya tha
 'kohinoor' means aura or mountain of lights
 yah kai mughal va farsi shaskaon se hota hua, antatah british shashan ke adhikaar main liya gaya, va unke khajaane main shaamil ho gaya, jab british pradhan mantri, benjamin disraeli ne maharani victoria ko 1877 main bharat kii samraji ghoshit kiya
 Like many other famous jewels, Kohinoor also has its own stories
 isse judi manyata ke anusaar, yah purush swaamiyon kaa durbhaagya va mrityu kaa kaaran bana, va stri swaminiyon ke liye saubhaahgya lekar aayaa
 According to other beliefs, the lord of Kohinoor became the ruler of the world
 iskaa udgam spasht nahin he
 In South India, there have been many stories related to diamonds, but which one is there, it is difficult to tell
 kai sroton ke anusaar, kohinoor hira, lagbhag 5000 varsh pehle, mila tha or yah pracheen sanskrit itihaas main likhe anusaar syamantak mani naam se prasiddh rahaa tha
 According to Hindu mythology, Lord Krishna himself took this gem from Jambavant, whose daughter Jamwanti later married Sri Krishna as well
 jab jamvanth so rahe the, tab shrikrishna ne yah mani chura lee thi
 According to another legend, it was found at the bottom of the Heera River, around 3200 BC
 aitihaasik pramaanon ke anusaar, yah golkunda kii khan se niklaa tha, jo andhra pradesh main, vishwa kii savase pracheen khaanon main se ek hai
 By 1730, it was the only diamond producing region in the world
 iske baad brazil main hiron kii khoj hui
 The word Golconda diamond has been used for the sake of high white color, clarity and high degree of transparency
 yah atyadhik durlabh, atah keemtee hote hai
 The South Indian legend, about this diamond, seems to be strong
 yah sambhav he, ki hira, andhra pradesh kii kollar khan, jo vartmaan main guntur jila main he, vahaan niklaa tha
 After the end of the Khilji dynasty in the Delhi Sultanate in 1320, Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq assumed the throne
 usne apane putr ulugh khan ko 1323 main kakaatiya vansh ke raja prataparudra ko haraane bheja tha
 The attack was hard-fought, but Ulugh Khan returned with a large army
 iske liye anpekshit raja, warangal ke yuddh main haar gaya
 Then the robbery, sabotage and murder of Warangal lasted for months
 sone-chaandi va hathi-daant kii bahutayat mili, jo ki haathiyon, ghodon va uunton par dilli le jaaya gaya
 The Kohinoor diamond was also part of that loot
 yaheen se, yah hira dilli sultanate ke uttaradhikariyon ke haathon se mughal samraat babar ke haath 1526 main laga
 The prima facie note of this diamond is found here from 1526
 babar ne apane babarnama main likhaa he, ki yah hira 1294 main malwa ke ek raja kaa tha
 Babar valued it so much that it could feed the whole world for two days, so expensive
 babarnama main diya he, ki kis prakaar malwa ke raja ko jabardastee yah viraasat allaudin khilji ko dene par majaboor kiya gaya
 After this it was carried forward by the successors of the Delhi Sultanate and finally in 1526, it was gained by Babur's victory
 haalanki babarnama 1526-30 main likhaa gaya tha, parantu iske strot gyaat nahin hai
 He has not always called this diamond with its current name
 balki ek vivaad ke baad yah nishkarsh niklaa ki babar kaa hira hi baad main kohinoor kahalaaya
 Both Babur and Humayun have written about the origin of Babur's diamond in their autobiographies
 yah hira pehle gwalior ke kushwaha shaskaon ke paas tha, jinase yah tomars raajaaon ke paas pahunchaa
 The last Tomar Vikramaditya was defeated by Alexander Lodhi, and subjugated him, and kept himself captive in Delhi
 lodhi kii mughalon se haar ke baad, mughalon ne uski sampatti luti, kintu rajkumaar humayu ne madhyasthata karke uski sampatti waapas dilava di, balki use chhudvaa kar, mewar, chittod main panaah lene diya
 In exchange for this goodness of Humayun, Vikramaditya gave his precious diamond, which was probably Kohinoor, to Humayun
 parantu humayu kaa jivan ati durbhagyapurna rahaa
 He lost to Sher Shah Suri
 suri bhi ek top ke gole se jal kar mar gaya
 His son and successor Jalal Khan was killed by his brother-in-law
 us saale ko bhi uske ek mantri ne takhtapalat kar hataa diya
 That minister also won a battle, he lost due to an eye injury, and lost the Sultanate
 humayu ke putr akbar ne yah ratna kabhi apane paas nahin rakhaa, jo ki baad main sidhe shahjahan ke khajaane main hi pahunchaa
 Shah Jahan was also overthrown by his son Aurangzeb, who also killed his other three brothers
 shahjahan ne kohinoor ko apane prasiddh mayur-singhaasana main jadvaya
 His son Aurangzeb imprisoned his father in Agra Fort
 yah bhi katha he, ki usne kohinoor ko khidki ke paas is tarah rakhaa, ki uske andar, shahjahan ko usamen tajmahal kaa pratibimb dikhaayi de
 Kohinoorumuglo remained until the invasion of the Iranian ruler Nadir Shah in 1739
 usne agra va dilli main bhayankar lutpaat kii
 He looted Kohinoor and immovable property including Peacock Throne
 is heere ko praapt karne par hi, nadir shah ke mukh se achaanak nikal padaa: koh-i-nur, jisase isko apana vartmaan naam mila
 Prior to 1739, no reference to this name is known
 kohinoor kaa moolyankan, nadir shah kii ek katha se miltaa he
 His queen said that if a powerful human, throwing five stones in all four directions, and upwards, with full power, then the empty space between them, if filled only with gold and jewels, would be worth it
 
 san 1747 main, nadir shah kii hatya ke baad, yah afghanistan ke ahamed shah abdali ke haathon main pahunchaa
 In 1830, Shuja Shah, then ruler of Afghanistan, somehow escaped along with Kohinoor; And reached Punjab, and presented the diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 iske badalen swaroop, ranjit singh ne east india company ko, apni tukadiyaan afghanistan bhej kar, afgaan gaddi jeet kar, shah shuja ko waapas dilaane ke liye taiyaar kar liya tha
 Ranjit Singh, had proclaimed himself the Maharaja of Punjab
 1839 main, apni mrityu shayya par usne apni vasiyat main, kohinoor ko puri, urisa prasiddh shri jagannatha, mandir ko daan dene ko likhaa tha
 But a dispute arose about his last words and ultimately he could not be fulfilled
 29 march,1849 ko lahore ke kile par british dhvaj fahraaya
 In this way Punjab was declared a part of British India
 lahore sandhi kaa ek mahatvapurn ang nimna anusaar tha:"koh-i-nur naamak ratna, jo shah-shuja-ul-mulk se maharaja ranjit singh dwaara liya gaya tha, lahore ke maharaja dwaara england kii maharani ko saunpa jaayegaa
 " is sandhi kaa prabharee governor general the, lord dalhauzi, jinaki kohinoor arjan kii chaah, is sandhi ke mukhya kaarnon main se ek thi
 His work in India has always been a subject of controversy, and the act of acquiring Kohinoor has been criticized by many British commentators
 haalanki, kuch ne yah bhi prastaav diya, ki heere ko maharani ko sidhe hi bhent kiya janaa chaiye tha, bajaay chhine jane ke; kintu dalhaizi ne ise yuddh kaa munafa samajha, va usee prakaar saheja
 Later, Dalhousie, in 1851, arranged for an offering to Queen Victoria by Dalip Singh, the successor of Maharaja Ranjit Singh
 teraa varshiya, dalip ne england kii yatra kii, va unhen bhent kiya
 This offering was the final instance of a gem being transferred as a cargo of war
 1851 main, landan ke hide park main ek vishaal pradarshnee main, british janata ko ise dikhaaya gaya
 There were some changes in the gemstone's erosion, which made him look more beautiful
 1852 main, victoria ke pati prince albert kii upasthiti main, heere ko punah taraasha gaya, jisase vah 186 1 / 6 carat se ghat kar 105
602 carat kaa ho gaya, kintu isaki abha main kai guna badhottaree hui
 Albert put his immense effort into this work, introducing intelligence, with good advice, as well as the then 8000 pounds, which reduced the weight of the gem by 42%, but Albert was still dissatisfied
 heere ko mukut main anya do hajaar hiron sahit jadaa gaya
 Later, it was inlaid with the main gemstone of the kirit of the Maharaja's wife
 maharani alexandria ise prayog karne vaali pratham maharani thim
 He was followed by Queen Mary
 1936 main, ise maharani elizabeth ke kirit kii shobhaa banaaya gaya
 In 2002, it was decorated over his coffin

 Apart from historical events, there are many stories and legends about where the unique Kohinoor originated in the world, crowned in the crown of the Queen of Britain and capable of enticing the hearts of many of the world's kings
 yah hira anek yudhon, sazishon, laalach, raktapaat or jai-paraajayon kaa sakshi rahaa he
 Kohinoor diamond is the king of all the diamonds in the world
 isaki kahani bhi pari kathaon se kam romaanchak nahin he
 There is no certified information about the birth of Kohinoor, but the first mention of Kohinoor was found 3000 years ago
 iskaa naata shri krishna kaal se bataaya jaataa he
 According to the Puranas, the Swantak Mani was later called Kohinoor
 ye mani surya se karn ko phir arjuna or yudhisthir ko mili
 Then Ashok, Harsha and Chandragupta got this gem
 san 1306 main yah mani sabase pehle malwa ke maharaja ramdev ke paas dekhi gayi
 After defeating the Maharaja of Malwa, Sultan Alauddin Khilji captured Mani
 babar se peedhee dar peedhee yah bemisaal hira antim mughal badshaah aurangzeb ko mila
 The 'jewels of Bitrain' believes that around 1655 Kohinoor was born to Kohinoor Khan in Golconda district of Hindustan
 tab heere kaa vajan tha 787 carat
 It was given to Shah Jahan by the mine owners as a gift
 san1739 tak hira shahjahan ke paas rahaa
 Then it went to Nadir Shah
 isaki chakachudhan chamak dekhakar hi nadir shah ne ise kohinoor naam diya
 The last Hindustani to hold Kohinoor was Ranjit Singh of Punjab
 san 1849 main punjab kii satta hathiyaane ke baad kohinoor angrejon ke haath lag gaya
 Then in 1850, East India Company presented the diamond to Queen Victoria
 england panhuchate-panhuchate kohinoor kaa vajan keval 186 rah gaya
 Prince Elvet, jeweler of Queen Victoria, harvested and polished the Kohinoor
 san 1852 se aaj tak kohinoor ko vajan 105
6 hi rah gaya he
 In 1911, the Kohinoor was inlaid in Queen Mary's Sartaj
 or aaj bhi usee taj main he
 It has been kept for exhibition in the 'tower of London' museum in London
 is heere kii labi katha ke baad, kai desh isapar apana daawa jataate rahe hai
 In 1976, Pakistan's Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto requested British Prime Minister Jim Callaghan to return to Pakistan, which he answered in a meek "no"
 
 anya daawa bharat ne kiya tha
 And Iran

 Shortly after independence, India has asserted its ownership over Kohinoor several times

 Translation request bharat kii golkunda kii khaanon se kohinoor ke alaava bhi duniya ke kai beshkeemtee heere nikle
 There are no such diamonds like Great Mughal, Orlov, Agra Diamond, Ahmedabad Diamond, Brolity of India, which are as valuable as Kohinoor

 While Cyprus, which joined the European Union in 2004, had signed the Schengen Agreement, implementation was delayed until at least 2010 due to the Cyprus dispute
 According to Cipriot's Minister of Foreign Affairs Giorgos Lillikas "strict and complete control of the Schengen base will create a major stir for the Turkish Cipriot on a daily basis," and it is unclear whether this control is possible before the dispute is resolved

 Ireland and the United Kingdom were the only members of the European Union who did not sign the Schengen Agreement before 2004's expansion
 donon desh apane bich ek khuli bhoomi seemaa ke saath ek aam yatra kshetra rakhte hai
 Britain refuses to join elements related to passport control of the Schengen Treaty, an argument given that for an island, border controls are a better and less intrusive way than other measures to prevent illegal immigration

 a cannon is a weapon that can project a heavy shell far enough
 ye praaia: barood yaa kisi visphotak ke dwaara utpann gasiy daab ke bal se gole ko daagate hai
 Cannon is not commonly used in the modern era
 iske sthaan mortar, hovitger aadi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Cannons are of many types depending on their ability, range, mobility, firing speed, firing angle and firing power etc
 san 1313 i
 se europe main top ke prayog kaa pakkaa pramaan miltaa he
 In India, Babur first used cannons in the battle of Panipat
 pehle topein kaanse kii banati thim or unako dhaala jaataa tha
 But such guns were not sufficiently athletic
 unamem adhik barood daalane se ve fat jaati thim
 To overcome this flaw, iron rings were heated and put on them very tightly
 thandha hone par aise challe sikudakar badi dridhtaa se bhitari naal ko dabaae rahete hai, thik usee prakaar jaise baiylgaadee ke pahie ke upar chadhi haal pahie ko dabaae rahati he
 For greater confirmation, the rods were also placed along the length of the rod along each other before mounting the rings
 is samay kii ek prasiddh top mons meg he, jo ab edinbura ke durg par shobhaa ke liye rakhi he
 After this, there was no significant advance in cannon making for about 200 years
 is yug main naalon kaa sanchhidr chikna hota tha
 But in about 1520 a German cannon maker started making spiral grooves in the fringes
 is top main golakaar gole ke badale lambotar "gole" prayukt hote the
 Due to the spiral grooves in the compound, the projecting body starts dancing with velocity
 is prakaar naachata pind vaayu ke pratirodh se bahut kam vichlit hota he or parinamswaroop lakshya par adhik sachai se padataa he
 In 1855, Lord Armstrong built a wrought iron cannon, in which all this material was removed by removing the lid from the back, instead of loading ammo from the mouth like earlier cannons
 isamen 40 pound ke prakshipt bhare jate the
 In ordinary cannons, the projectile comes out at great speed and the cannon can not be moved in a very high direction
 duusari ore choti naal kii topein halki banati hai or unase nikle prakshipt main bahut veg nahin hota, parantu inamen yah gun hota he ki prakshipt bahut upar uthakar neeche girtaa he or isliye isse diwaar, pahari aadi ke peeche chhipe shatru ko bhi maar sakate hai
 These are called mortars
 majholi naap kii nalwali top ko houvitzar kehete hai
 As the cannon making progressed, so too did the advancements in the making of mortars and howitzers
 praaia: sabhi deshon main ek hi prakaar se topon ke nirmaan main unnati hui, kyonki baraabar hode lagi rahati thi
 When one country makes more heavy, more powerful or more quick-fire cannons, the matter is not hidden for many days and the rival countries would have tried to make even better guns
 1898 i
 main fransavaalon ne ek aisi top banaai jo uske baad bananevaali topon kii pathpradarshak hui
 The velocity of the projectile was higher than that; His attribution was commendable; The firing was completely stable, because in the implantation there were grains which did not allow the cannon to move in any direction by getting stuck in the ground
 sabhi topein daagne par peeche hatati hai
 Fluids were used to reduce the velocity of this attack
 iske prakshipt patali diwaar ke banaae the
 Each of these weights was about 12 pounds and contained about three and a half pounds of high explosive ammo
 prakshipt main vishesh rasayanon se yukt ek topi bhi rahati thi, jisase lakshya par pahunchakar prakshipt fat jaataa tha or tukade bade veg se idhar-udhar shatru ko dur tak ghayal karte the
 It can also kill soldiers hiding behind a wall
 pratham vishwayuddh main germanon ne 'big bartha' naamak top banaai, jisase unhone paris par 75 mile kii duuri se gole barsaanaa aarambh kiya
 There was no new theory in this cannon
 top keval paryaapt badi or pusht thi
 But with the invention of airplanes and other new instruments such guns have now become endangered
 aropan - aarambh main topein praaia: kisi bhi drudh chabutare athwa chaowkee par aropit kii jaati thim, parantu dhire-dhire isaki aavashyaktaa log anubhav karne lage ki topon ko sudrudh gadiyon par aropit karnaa chahie, jisamen ve sugamawa se ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchaai ja saken or praaia: turant gola daagne ke liye taiyaar ho jaaen
 On the back of the car there was also a part of the tail like the tail, in which the car did not run back
 sugamawa se khinchi ja sakanevaali top kii gaadiyaan san 1680 se banane lagi
 In 1867, Dr
 C
W
 Siemens suggested that the cannon should be fitted with a cannon in order to prevent the attack, in which the mouth of the water is small
 peeche yahi kaam kamanion se liya jane laga
 Trains also started being made of steel
 vayuyanon ko maar giraane ke liye topein 1914 tak nahin bani thim
 At first, very small cannons were made, then 13-pound projectile cannons, which were mounted on three tons of motor lanes
 ab inase bhi baari topein pehle se bhi drudh traliyon athwa ispaat ke bane tenkon par aropit rahati hai
 Tank piercing cannons have to be very powerful
 tanks ispaat kii moti chaadaron kii bani gaadiyaan hote hai
 The warrior sitting inside them kills the enemy with a cannon loaded on the tank and himself is very safe
 san 1941 kii tanks bhedi topein 17 pound ke gole daagti thim
 a soldier inside a manned vehicle is protected only by a simple gun and rifle
 hawaii jahaajon par 25 pound ke gole daagnevaali topein, 3
7 inch vyas ke houvitzar or 4
2 inch vyas ke morter dwitiya vishvayuyaddh main prayukt ho rahe the
 The cannons, without swagger, were also made such that some gases escaped from behind, but did not become popular, as they were not found to be powerful enough
 vijayant tanks - bhartiya sena kaa apana tanks he
 Built in the heavy vehicle factory, this tank has immense firepower as well as the ability to rotate all-round

 Mechanical Vehicles - In 1909, the War Office of England declared a reward of 7,500 rupees for a tractor that could run 200 miles without fuel or lubricant for a load of eight tons
 tabhi se topavahak yantrik gadiyon kaa janm hua
 Now such vehicles are available which can run smoothly in the fields etc
 without roads
 inke pahiyon par shrinkhalaaon kaa patta chadha rahata he
 Due to this, these trains can run on bumpy land
 in gadiyon kaa veg 30-35 mile pratighanta hota he, parantu shrinkhalaa patta lagbhag dedh hajaar mile ke baad kharaab ho jaataa he
 In World War II, four or six-wheel cannon tractors were built, like ordinary motorcars, but with special heavy, air-filled rubber wheels
 inamen lagbhag 100 ashv samarthy ke ingine rahete the or inpar nau das ton bhaar tak kii topein lad sakati thim
 Sailor Cannon - Before the invention of torpedoes, cannons were the main armament of ships
 ab top, tarpeado or hawaii jahaaj ye teen mukhya aayudh hai
 In the 18th century, 100 cannons were used in ships carrying a load of 2,000 tons
 inamen se aadhi baari gole chhodti thim or shesh halke gole ; parantu aadhunik samay main topon kii sankhya tathaa golon kaa bhaar kam kar diya gaya he or golon kaa veg badha diya gaya he
 For example, in the Dreadnought race ships named Revenge in 1915, eight cannons were 15 inches in diameter behind
 aisi hi chaar topein aage or aath bagal main thim
 Apart from these, 12 small guns were six inches
 topon, houvitzron or mortaron kii aakalpanaaon main antar rahata he
 The main difference lies in the diameter of the cluster and the ratio of this diameter and length
 yantra main jitani hi adhik barood bharani ho, yantra kii deevaaron ko utana hi adhik pusht bananaa padataa he
 That is why the cannon is heavier than the canopy of the same size
 ab to ucch aatati ispaton ke uplabdh rahane ke kaaran pusht topon kaa bananaa pehle jaisaa kathin nahin he, parantu ab barood kii shakti bhi bad gai he
 Even now the cannon drains are made with hot and tight shells on cold drains, or they are tightly wrapped with steel wire and an outer cord is fastened on top of this wire
 bhitari naal ati tapt ispaat main gulli thonkkar banaai jaati he or naal ko thonk petakar uchit akruti kaa kiya jaataa he
 Instead of rotating at a speed, some tubes are also cast in the mold

 When the pain became unbearable, he called the learned Brahmins of Banaras and explained their problem
 brahmanon ne raav ko iske liye satchandi yajna karne kaa suzav diya
 Rao immediately agreed
 shatchandi yajna hua or yajmaan bane raav ne raatri vishram yajna praangan main hi kiya
 At night, Mother Sarvamangala Devi again gave her a dream and told her the place where her idol was buried

 The workers were ordered to remove the idol safely

 No side of one leg of the idol was found
 tab maa ne raav ko bataaya ki unka ek pair pataal main he
 So get my house built at this place

 Non-functional testing refers to aspects of software that may not be related to a particular function or user action, such as mounting or security
 Non-functional testing answers questions such as "how many people can log in at once", or "how easy it is to hack this software"

 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi apekshaaon main koi samasya sirf release ke baad saamne aati he, to iskaa kharchaa apekshaaon kii samiksha dwaara hi pataa laga liye jane ke kharche se 10-100 guna adhik hoga
 a common cause of software failure is compatibility with other applications, a new operating system, or, a growing web browser version
 pasch sangatta kii kami ke maamle main, yah isliye ho saktaa he, kyonki programmer ne apane program kii koding yaa software kaa pareekshan sirf, is-or-us oparating system "ke naveenatam sanskaran" par karne kaa vichaar kiya
 An unintended consequence of this fact is that: their latest work may not be fully compatible with the prior mix of software / hardware, or it may not be fully compatible with another important operating system
 kisi bhi sthiti main, ye matbhed, ve jo bhi hon, software vifaltaa main parinat hue honge, jaisaa ki computer prayoktaaon ke kuch mahatvapurn tabake ne mahasoos kiya
 One might consider this to be a "security-oriented strategy" that fits precisely with the latest testing phase suggested by Dave Gelperin and William C
 Hetzel, as cited below
 
 a major problem with software testing is that testing is not possible under all combinations of input and pre-conditions, even with a common product
 iskaa matlab he ki software utpaada main dosha kii sankhya kaaphi adhik ho sakati hai or jo dosha kabhi-kabhi hote hai unhen pareekshan main khojna mushkil he
 More importantly, non-functional dimensions of quality - usability, mountability, performance, compatibility, reliability - can be highly subjective; Something that constitutes sufficient value for one person, unbearable for another
 software pareekshan ke liye kai drushtikon hai
 Review, cross-over, or inspection is considered static testing, while the actual executed program code with a given set of test cases is considered a dynamic test
 static pareekshan ko choda ja saktaa he
 Dynamic testing is used when the program itself is being used for the first time
 dinemic pareekshan, program ke 100% purna hone se pehle code ke vishesh hisson ke pareekshan ke liye shuru ho sakati he 
 Typical techniques for this are using stubs / drivers or execution from a debugger environment
 For example, spreadsheet programs are, by their very nature, mutually tested to a large extent, under which results are displayed immediately after each calculation or text operation
 software pareekshan kaa prayog satyaapan or pramanikaran ke saahchary se kiya jaataa he: The term verification and authentication are commonly used interchangeably in industry; It is also common to misinterpret these two words
 IEEE software ejineering kii maanak shabdaawalee ke anusaar: Software testing can be done by a software tester
 1980 ke dashak tak shabd "software tester" ko aam taur par istemaal kiya jaataa tha, lekin baad main ise ek alag vyavsaay ke rup main dekha gaya
 Various roles related to periods and different goals have been established in software testing: Manager, Test Lead, Test Designer, Tester, Automation Developer and Test Administrator haalanki vivaadaaspad, software pareekshan ko software quality ashurence prakriya ke ek mahatvapurn hisse ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 At SQA, software process specialists and auditors have a comprehensive view on software and its development
 ve software ejineering prakriya kii jaanch karte hai or pradutt software main maujuud dosha: tathakthith dosha dar kii maatra ko kam karne ke liye use hi badal dete hai
 What constitutes an "acceptable defect rate" depends on the nature of the software
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek arched video game main, jise ek hawaii jahaaj udaane kaa abhas dene ke liye dizine kiya gaya he, sambhawatah dosha ke prati apekshaakrit adhik sahansheeltaa hogi, us mishan critical software kii tulana main, jiskaa upyog ek airliner ko niyantrit karne main hota he, jo vastav main ud rahaa he
 Although there are close associations with SQA, testing departments often operate independently and may not have SQA functions in a company
 software pareekshan, ek computer program ke apekshit parinaamon ko, die gaye ek input set ke liye, iske vaastavik parinaamon se tulana karte hue, software main dosha kaa pataa lagane ke uddeshy se kiya gaya kaary he
 Paradoxically, QA is the implementation of policies and procedures aimed at preventing errors from occurring
 software pareekshan tareeqon ko paramparaagat rup se blike box pareekshan or white box pareekshan main vibhajit kiya gaya hai
 Both of these approaches are used to describe the approach that a test engineer adopts for designing test cases
 blike box pareekshan, software se ek "blike box" ke rup main vyavhaar karata he - bina kisi aantarik karyanvayan kii jaankaree ke blike box pareekshan tareekon main shaamil hai: equivelens partishning, boundry vailu enelysis, ol peyars pareekshan, faj pareekshan, model-besd pareekshan, tresebility metrics, exploretary pareekshan or spacification-aadhaarit pareekshan
 Therefore, black box testing has the advantage of "an unsympathetic opinion" on the one hand and a "blind search" on the other
 white box pareekshan tab hoti he jab pareekshak ke paas, aantarik data sanrachanaon or ise lagu karne vaale code sahit elgoridam tak pahunch sulabh hoti he
 They both return a code coverage metric, measured as a percentage
 grey box pareekshan main shaamil he aantarik data sanrachanaon or elgoridam tak, pareekshan maamalon ko dizin karne ke liye pahunch, lekin upyogkarta, yaa blike box str par pareekshan
 input data kaa parivartan or output ko formet karnaa, grey box ke tahat nahin aata, kyonki input or output us "blike-box" se spasht rup se baahar he, jise ham pareekshan ke tahat system kah rahe hai
 This difference is particularly important when performing integration testing between two modules of code written by two different developers, where only the interface is presented for testing
 haalanki, ek data bhandar ko sanshodhit karnaa zarur grey box ke antargat aata he, chunki aam taur par upyogkarta pareekshan ke tahat system ke baahar data badalane main sakasham nahin hoga
 Gray box testing may also include reverse engineering, for example, to determine the bounding value or error message
 pareekshanon ko aksar, software vikaas prakriya main unke shaamil hone kii jagah ke aadhaar par vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, yaa pareekshan kii vishistataa ke str dwaara
 Unit testing refers to tests that verify the functionality of a particular section of code, usually at the process level
 ek object-unmukh parivesh main, yah aksar shrenee str par hota he or nunatam ikai pareekshan main shaamil hota he constructor or distractor
 These types of tests are typically written by developers when they are working on code to ensure that a particular process is working properly as expected
 code main corner caces yaa anya shakhaon ko pakadaney ke liye, ek prakriya main kai pareekshan ho sakate hai
 Unit testing, alone, cannot verify the functionality of a piece of software, but is used to ensure that the building blocks used by the software function independently of each other
 integration pareekshan kisi bhi prakaar kaa software pareekshan he, jo ek software dizin ke prati ghatakon ke bich interphes ko satyapit karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Software components can be integrated iteratively or together
 aam taur par pehle vaale tareeqe ko ek behatar abhyaas mana jaataa he, chunki yah interfes muddon ko twarit rup se sthaneey hone or thik hone kii anumati detaa he
 Integration testing works to expose errors in interfaces and to show interactions between integrated components
 uttarottar, architektural dizin ke tatwon ke anuroop jaanche gaye software ghatakon ke bade samoohon ko ekikrut or tab tak jaancha jaataa he, jab tak software ek system ke rup main kaam naa karne lage
 System testing tests a fully integrated system to verify that it meets its requirements
 system integration pareekshan yah pushti karata he ki ek system, system aavashyaktaaon main paribhaashit kisi bhi bahari yaa anya paksh ke system se ekikrut he
 Regression testing focuses on finding faults after a major code change
 vishesh rup se, yah software pratigaman ko yaa puraane bag jo waapas aa gaye hai, unhen ujagar karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Such regressions occur whenever the software process, which was previously working correctly and now stops working as expected
 vishisht rup se, pratigaman, program parivartan ke ek anpekshit parinaam ke rup main ghatit hote hai, jab software kaa nav viksit hissaa, pehle se maujuud code ke saath takaraata he
 Common methods of regression testing include re-running previously run tests and checking if previously corrected errors have reappeared
 pareekshan kii gaharaai, jari prakriya main charan par nirbhar karti he or atirikt visheshtaon ke jokhim par
 ve yaa to purna ho sakate hai, release main kaaphi der se jode gaye parivartanon ke liye yaa phir jokhim bhare, bahut uthle tak, prayek suvidha par sakaaratmak pareekshan se bane hue, agar badlaav, relies main jaldi ho rahe hai yaa kam jokhim vaale samajhe jate hai
 Acceptance testing can refer to one of two: alpha pareekshan, sambhavit upyogkartaaon / graahakon yaa develper kii site par ek swatantra test team dwaara nakli yaa vaastavik sanchaalan pareekshan he
 Before the software went into beta testing, alpha testing is often used as a form of internal acceptance testing for off-the-shelf software
 beta pareekshan alpha pareekshan ke baad aata he
 The software version, known as the beta version, was released to a limited clientele outside the programming team
 software ko logon ke samoohon ke liye jari kiya jaataa he, taaki aage ke pareekshan yah sunishchit kar saken ki utpaada main nunatam kharabiyaan yaa bag hai
 Sometimes, the beta version is made available to the open public to increase the response area to the maximum number of prospective users
 software ke gair-kaaryaatmak pahaluon ke pareekshan ke liye vishesh tareeqe maujuud hai
 Unlike functional testing, which establishes the correct operation of software, non-functional testing confirms that the software functions properly even when it receives invalid or unexpected input
 software folt injection, fajing ke rup main, ek gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan kaa udhaaharan he
 Non-functional testing, specifically for the sake of software, is designed to establish whether the construct under the test can tolerate invalid or unexpected input and thus the input validation routine as well as the error - Will be able to establish the strength of the handling routine
 vibhinn vanijyik gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan upkaran, software folt injection prishth se jude hote hai; kai khule strot ke or muft software upkaran uplabdh hai, jo gair-kaaryaatmak pareekshan karte hai
 Performance testing, or load testing, checks to see if the software can handle large amounts of data or users
 aam taur par ise software scalebility ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 This activity of non-functional software testing is often referred to as a capability test
 sthaitv pareekshan yah dekhne ke liye jaanch karata he ki software ek sweekaarya avadhi main yaa usase upar, lagaataar acchhee tarah se kaary karata saktaa he yaa nahin
 This activity of non-functional software testing is often referred to as load testing
 prayojyata pareekshan kii jarurat yah jaanchane ke liye hoti he ki yuzar interfes kaa upyog karnaa or use samajhnaa aasaan he yaa nahin
 Security testing is required for software that refines confidential data to prevent system intrusion by hackers
 anterrashtriyakaran or sthaniyakaran kii jarurat software ke in pahaluon kii jaanch ke liye hoti he, jiske liye ek chhadmasthaniyakaran vidhi kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 This will confirm that the application works even after being translated into a new language or adapted to a new culture
 vinaashak pareekshan, software yaa up-pranali ko isaki majbootee ke jaanch ke liye, vifal karne kaa prayaas karti he
 a common method of software testing is performed by an independent group of testers, before it is sent to the client and after its functionality is developed
 is abhyaas ke parinamswaroop aksar pareekshan charan kaa, pariyojna main hui deree kii kshatipurti ke liye pariyojna bafer ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he or is prakaar se pareekshan ke liye samarpit samay ke saath samjhauta hota he
 Another practice is to start software testing from the moment the project starts and it is a continuous process till the completion of the project
 jawaab main, kuch aise ubharate software vishay jaise extream programing or azeil software development andolan, ek "test driven software development" model kaa paalan karte hai
 In this process, unit tests are first written by the software engineer
 Of course these tests initially fail; As expected from them
 or phir jaise hi code likhaa jaataa he yah pareekshan sweet ke bade ansh ke sanwarddhit rup se gujarata he
 Test suites are constantly renewed and integrated with any developed regression test due to new failure conditions and corner cases
 baaki software sorce code ke saath unit test ko banaae rakhaa jaataa he or aam taur par bild prakriya main ekikrut kiya jaataa he 
 Although variation exists between organizations, there is a specific cycle for testing
 nimna namoona, water fall deveopment model ko apnaane vaale sanghathanon ke bich aam he
 Many programming groups are relying more and more on automated testing, especially such groups that use jotest driven development
 test likhane ke kai fremawork hai or satat ekikaran software, pareekshan ko swatah chalaaegaa, jab har baar code ek varjan control system main parkhaa jayega
 While automation cannot build everything that a human can, it can be very useful for regression testing
 tathaapi, vastav main upyogi hone ke liye, isamen script pareekshan kii ek purna viksit test sweet kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Program testing and fault detection can be greatly assisted by test equipment and debuggers
 pareekshan / dibg upkarnon kii visheshtaon main shaamil hai: Some of these properties can be incorporated into an integrated development environment
 aam taur par, jin vishyon tak gunvattta simit hoti he, ve hai shuddhta, sampoornataa, suraksha, lekin ISO maanak ISO 9126 ke tahat varnit adhik takneekee aavashyaktaaen bhi shaamil ho sakati hai, jaise kshamta, vishwasaneeyata, dakshata, suvahyata, rakh-rakhaav, sangatta or 0}prayojyata
 Several common software measures exist, often called 'metrics', which are used to measure the software's condition or test adequacy
 software pareekshan prakriya kai artiffact ko utpann kar sakati he
 Several certification programs exist to bolster the professional aspirations of software testers and quality assurance specialists
 vartmaan main pradaan kiye jane vaale pramann main aisa koi nahin he, jisamen vastav main aavedak ke liye software pareekshan kii kshamta ko pradarshit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 No certification is based on a widely accepted framework of knowledge
 is tathy ne kuch logon ko yah kehane ke liye prerit kiya ki pareekshan kshetra abhi pramann ke liye taiyaar nahin he
 Certification alone cannot measure a person's productivity, their skills, or practical knowledge, and cannot guarantee their ability as an examiner, or professional style
 kuch pramukh software pareekshan vivaadon main shaamil hai: The Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Pilani, is a constituent laboratory of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, established in 1953
 vaastavik anusandhan evam vikaas kaary varsh 1958 ke antim bhaag se aarambh hua
 This institute is mainly engaged in research and development in the field of semiconductor devices, electronic systems and electronic tubes
 anek pariyojnaon ke karyanvayan main aarambh se hi aadharbhoot suvidhaayen, vishisht janashakti evam visheshgyata ke vikaas par vishesh dhyaan diya jaataa rahaa he
 It is headquartered at Pilani as well as its regional center in Chennai which is functioning on the premises of CSIR Complex
 is kshetreey kendra main mukhyat: kaagaj evam khaadya padaarth prakraman sambandhi shodh evam vikaas kaary chal rahaa he
 The major research and development programs of CSIR-CERI can be classified into three major areas: microwave tubes, semiconductor devices and electronic systems
 microwave tubs ke kshetra main dhyaan mukhyat: sanchaar tubs or audyogic tubs par he
 Projects on IC design, power electronics, device processing, microwave devices, hybrid micro-circuits, photonics and light electronics devices and semiconductor materials are actively in the field of semiconductor devices
 electronic pranaaliyon ke kshetra main aankik pranaliyaan, krishi electronic, bhaashan praudyogiki, audyogic electronic, instrumentation pranaaliyon or sanchaar abhiyantriki par anusandhan evam vikaas kaary kendrit he
 Garamukhi or Pankamukhi or Punk volcano is a natural composition in which a mound of hot liquids and gases emerging from the bottom of the ground form a mound of soil and debris from above the mouth
 ek tarah se yah jwalamukhi kii tarah hi hota he haalanki garaamukhi se lava nahin nikalataa or inkaa taapmaana jwalamukhiyon se bahut kam hota he
 Around 700 Garamukhi are known all over the world and the largest one is 700 meters high and has a diameter of 10 km
 garamukhiyon se nikalne vaali gas kaa lagbhag 85% methane hota he or iske atirikt isamen carbon dioxide or nitrogen bhi hoti hai
 The liquid coming out of these is mostly hot water, which contains fine dust and leaf particles, though some amount of hydrocarbon fluids is also there
 aksar yah drav amleey or namakeen hota he
 Some astronomers suspect the presence of Garamukhis on Mars as well
 sena dwaara sanchalit udaanon ko chhodkar anya sabhi prakaar kii udaanon ko naagarik uddyan ke hi antargat mana gaya he
 The functions that are used in this are: commercial traffic of passengers, goods and postage, flights in private status for business or hobby and its use for the purpose of government purposes

 By 1910, air traffic was practically adopted in most countries
 sheeghra pratham vishwayuddh saamne aayaa
 This gave sufficient motivation to advance scientific and technical experiments and by the end of the war, the air means of transport were well established
 iske baad teevr pragati hui
 By the end of 1919 aircrafts between London and Paris became operational

 Thus, commercial aviation has now entered the jet age
 bharat main vayucharyaaon ke chalaae jane kii charchaa bharat sarkaar dwaara bahut pehle, 1917 main hi, prarambh kii gai thi
 At the end of the First World War, in September 1919, the government decided to hand over the responsibility of transporting postage across India to a traffic company, but nothing could be done

 An Indian atmosphere was established
 sab kuch hone par bhi sarkaar ne nitinirdhaaran karne ke atirikt or kuch na kiya
 In the following years, Britain, France, and Holland established aerial practices in far-eastern colonies outside India
 in pragatiyon ne bharat sarkaar ko bhi sochane ko baadhya kiya or bharat main sahaayak charyaayein chalaane kii aavashyaktaa kaa usne anubhav kiya
 Consequently, negotiations with Indian traders were initiated

 Omkara Shukla aka Omi is a Bahubali, known for his political interference
 vah kai avaidh guton kaa mukhiya hota he jisamen vah sthaneey rajaneta tiwari bhaisaab jaison kii aapraadhik uddeshyon kii purti karata hai
 Ishwar Tyagi alias Langa and Keshav Upadhyay alias Keshu Firangi live like Sipahsalar near him
 film ke aarambhik drishy main langadaa tyaagi ek bas se bhari baraat rokkar rajju ko apni shaadi sthagit karne yaa omi dwaara daali mishra kii agavaai ko rokane kii chunauti detaa hai
 The rope reaches the in-laws house alone and reports Omi's leadership
 daali ke pita vakil raghunatha mishra, jise sabhi 'vakil saab' ke naam se jaanate hai, krodhavash apane aadamiyon ke saath omi ke thikaane pahonchte hai
 And threatening to release Dolly, firing a pistol at Omi's head
 lekin ain kshan main bhaisaab phonkaal dwaara donon ke bich tanaav todate hue vartmaan kii raajnneetik sthiti kaa hawala dekar khun-kharaba rokane ko kehete hai
 The next day Raghunath pressures Bhaisab to free his daughter
 lekin asal mudda daali ke apane pita ke samaksh hi khulata hai jab daali swechha se omi ko sweekaarti he or uske jabaran agavaai kii baat jhuthi tehraate he
 And the reasons for this decision give reasons one by one
 is baat se daali ke pita sharmindagi or vishwasghaat se tut jate he
 Here the director refers to the original composition 'othello' to make a twist in the plot, where Dolly's father explains to Omi 'bahubali! Do not forget the tricolor of the woman
 jo apane baap ko thag sakati he vah or kii sagi kya hogi ? Omi now employs or eradicates tactics like MMS sex scandel to prevent other rivals such as Indore Singh and Surendra Kaptan from participating in elections amid political conspiracies
 bhaisaab ab nirvirodh rup se loksabhaa ke vidhayak ban jate hai tathaa omi ko aagaamee lok chunaav main naye pratyaashee ke rup main chunaa jaataa hai
 And then Omi then declares Keshu as the new contender for the vacant post of the party's new 'bahubali', despite the lame's experience of all political activities
 omi ke shushk faisle se langadaa swayan ko apamaanit mahasoos karne saath keshu se irshyaa kar baithta he kyonki uske anusaar keshu anubhavheen ke saath gairjimmedaar bhi hai chaahe vah shikshit or yuvavarg main lokapriy hi kyon naa ho
 To avenge this insult, he lures him into drinking liquor on the basis of wishing Keshu good luck, due to which Keshu becomes furious and quarrels with the guests
 keshu kii karatuut omi ko maaloom pad jaati he jisase omi ko apane harek faisle par andeh hone lagata hai
 Here the lame one-handed asks Keshu to reconcile with Omi as Daly's old friendship, while in the other hand he tells Omi the concocted story of the suspicious relationship between Daly and Keshu
 isi bich omi kii ore se mili tohfe 'kamarband' ko daali anjaane main gum kar detii he jise indu apane yahaan chupa leti he
 When this thing is known to the lame, he puts many people in the circle of faith and mistrust through this waistband
 is bich tiwari bhaisahab par kichlu dwaara pranadhatak hamalaa hota he, jo usee ke virdohi indore singh kaa aadmi he
 Omi is determined to take revenge, so the lame now gives the same waistband Keshu a chance to find Kichalu through Billo Chamanbahar and kill him for getting the praise from Omi
 lekin yahaan bhi halaat keshu ke prati viparitt hi rahete hai kyonki langadaa yah kahkar omi ko bargalaata he ki daali kaa pahana kamarband keshu kii mashuka billo ke yahaan kaise pahunchaa ? kya daali ne jaanboojhkar kamarband keshu ko saunpi thi ? omi khinnata se ghar aakar daali se sawaal karata he par use swany gyaat nahin padataa ki omi uske saath rushth vyavhaar kyon kar rahaa he ? byaah ke kuch roj pehle tak omi or daali kaa prem ksheen padate dekh, indu omi ke ashankit man ko bhaanpate hue shaadi ko rokane or daali ko khud sanbhaalane kaa taana detii he
 In the meantime, Omi gets an order to kill Indore Singh on behalf of Bhagyahab along with the lame, after carrying out the work, Omi beats the same lame, saying that he should give evidence of suspiciousness between Dolly and Keshu, otherwise the case is proved to be false Lose your life shaadi kii raat omi kii sabhi galatfahami ko langadaa apni kuchaalon se pushti kar detaa he ki daali or keshu ke bich vaaki avaidh rishte hai
 Omi, angry with this false infidelity, brutally kills Dolly in his own honeymoon, while the lame shoots Keshu on Omi's orders with his gun
 dhamaake ke aawaaj se dari hooi indu omi ke kamare ghus daali ko mrit paakar hairaan pad jaati he
 But at the same time, Indu says to Kamarband that he had stolen it
 ab donon ko samaj aati hai ki in sabhi ke jimmvari kaa kaaran langadaa hi hai jisane apane kuteel chaalon main sabko gumraah rakhaa
 Anguished by the confidant and devastation, Indu cuts her husband's limp's neck with light, while faking herself and Omi, helpless, commits suicide as soon as the injured Keshu arrives
 antim drushay main asahaay keshu jhule jhulate nishpraan daali or neeche pade mrit omi ko dekhtaa he
