 parantu in sampradaayon ko totemvaadi kahana asangat hoga kyonki inamen na to totem par gana kaa naam hi rakhaa jaataa he or na gana ke sadsy totem ke pitru hi maanate hai
 Rijle is of the view that all the castes of India in which even a single symptom of totemism is found were initially totemistic

 Before the 20th century, the names of Dhumketu were named on the basis of year, such as 'great Dhumketu of 1580', 'great Dhumketu of September 1882'
 a scientist named Edmund Haley proved that the comet seen in 1531, 1607 and 1582 was the same and predicted to reappear in 1957
 In fact, in 1959, this comet reappeared in the sky, when it was named Haley Dhumketu
 Similarly, the names of the recurring dhumkets were named after the person who computed his tour class
 Since then, recurring dhumkets have been named after the one who searched for them, but only once visible dhumkhetoos are named after the year in which they appear even today

 In 1994 the International Astronomical Union approved the new naming system
 The names of comets are now represented by the year they are searched, by the indication of the fortnight they have been discovered, and by the serial number of the search for the same year
 Such a system is already being used for asteroids
 Thus in the second fortnight of February 2006, Dhumketu, which is the fourth comet discovered in that year, will be named 2006 D4
 The prefix is also added to indicate the nature of the comet

 Some people called it a falling star
 Aristotle discussed comets in his first book Mitrology
 Many earlier intellectuals recognized it as the planets of the solar system
 But Aristotle rejected this notion because the planets appear in a fixed constellation in the sky while comets can be seen anywhere in the sky
 According to Aristotle, comets were born in the outer atmosphere of the Earth
 Like comets, Aristotle had the same belief for meteors, auroras, boreolias and galaxies
 Many erstwhile intellectuals disagreed with this view of Aristotle
 Seneca disagreed on this view in the Natural Question
 According to him, comets have no effect on the external environment or wind
 Human beings then had little knowledge about space

 amichand, sambhavat: vaastavik naam ameerchand kaa bengali uccharan
 Occasional British and on the basis of them, the historian Macaulay has called it Bengali; But in fact he was a Sikh businessman living in Amritsar and settled in Calcutta for a long time
 angrejon ke prabhutv kaa prasar sarvapratham dakshin main hua, kintu angreji samrajya ke sansthaapan kii neenv bengal main hi padi
 In Bengal, Indian businessmen were the first to come in contact with the British, inspired by the spirit of occupation
 alivardi khan ke kathor niyantran main to angrej apane prabhutv kaa vistaar karne main asamarth rahe; kintu alpavayask, aparipakvabuddhi tathaa uddhatprakruti sirajuddaula ke rajarohan se yah sambhav ho sakaa
 Inspired by extreme selfish gains, Amichand helped the British well; However, his name in history would have remained unfamiliar if Clive's unethical conduct prior to the Plassey War would not have severely criticized Clive's work in the Parliament of England and by British historians
 amichand ne angarejon ke vyavsaayik sampark main aakar yathesht dhan arjeet kar liya tha
 From the point of view of diplomacy, it was desirable for the erstwhile Britishers to suppress the dominance of Siraj-ud-daulah after Siraj-ud-daula's accession, for the promotion of British collective and individual gains, from legitimate or illegal measures
 is ghatnakram main sirajuddaula ne angrejon ke mukhya vyavsaayik centre kalakatta par akraman karne kaa nishchay kiya
 Before this attack, the British sent soldiers to arrest Amichand only on suspicion
 sipaahiyon ne amichand ke ant:poor par akraman kar diya
 In order to avoid becoming obedient, thirteen women of the inner body were murdered
 aise marmaatak apmaan ke hone par bhi amichand ne angrejon kaa saath diya
 After the fall of Calcutta, he sheltered many British refugees and also provided assistance in other ways
 clive ne amichand ko wats kaa doot banaakar nawab kii rajdhani murshidaabad bheja
 In this situation he provided invaluable assistance to the British
 sambhavat:, chandranagar par angrejon ke akraman ke liye nawab se anumati dilwane main amichand kaa hi haath tha
 He turned the British on the side of the Nawab's chief officer Maharaj Nandkumar from Siraj-ud-daula
 nawab ke viruddh jagatseth mirajafar ke saath angrejon ne jis gupt shadyantr kaa aayojan kiya tha usamen bhi amichand kaa bahut bada haath tha
 Later, while Mirzafar was having a treaty with Clive, Amichand threatened the British to reveal the distinction to the Nawab if he did not give five percent of the treasury he received after Siraj-ud-daula's removal
 amichand ko vifalpraytn karne ke liye do sandhipatr taiyaar kiye gaye
 a counterfeit, in which Amichand was admitted to have a five per cent share; The second real, in which this excerpt was omitted
 admiral watsan ne nakli sandhipatr par hastakshar karne se inkaar kar diya
 Clive then mimics Watson's signature on it, showing it to Amichand, the fake treaty, convincing him
 samayik itihaaskaar ormi kaa kathan he ki sirajuddaula kii padachyuti ke baad jab vaastavik sthiti amichand ko bataai gai to is aghat se uskaa mastishk vikrut ho gaya tathaa kuch samay uparaant uski mrityu ho gai
 However, according to historian Beveridge, he lived ten more years

 Geoffrey Rush on the Internet Movie Database alluri seetaram raju bharat ke swatantraaa sangram ke ek krantikari the
 The forest dwellers are dear to freedom, they cannot be held in bondage or subjugation, so they first started their struggle against the foreign invaders and oppressors from the forests till the country became independent
 aaj ham kah sakate hai ki jangalon ke tilon se hi swadhinata kii yojana kaa aarambh hua
 This is the son of nature, that is why he created the freedom of the forests
 aise prakruti premi vanavaasi krantikariyon kii lambii shrunkhlaa hai
 Many dominated the scene and many remained anonymous
 jinhone apana sampoorn jivan swatantraaa ke sangharsh main guzaara
 One such great revolutionary Alluri Sitaram Raju was born on 4 July 1897 in Pandrik village of Visakhapatnam district
 krantikari, vir raju ne schuli shiksha ke sathsath nijee ruchi ke taur par vaidyak or jyotish kaa bhi adhyayan kiya or yah adhyayan unke vyavhaarik abhyaas main bhi laga rahaa
 Due to this, when he started organizing Vanvasi society against the British at a young age, the knowledge of these genres provided him unprecedented help
 raju kaa paalanposhan uske chachaa alluri ramakrishna ke parivaar main hua
 His father Alluri Venkata Ramaraju lived in the Maggool village of Godavari
 unhone bal avasthaa main hi seetaram raju ko yah bataakar krantikari sanskaar die ki angrej hi to hamen gulam banaae hai, jo desh ko lut rahe hai
 The father was left with the learning of these words, but the seeds of Viplav Path were planted
 yuvavastha main vanavaasiyon ko angrejon ke shoshan ke viruddh sangathit karnaa shuru kiya, jiskaa aarambh vanavaasiyon kaa upachaar va bhavishya kii jaankaree dene se hota tha
 Not only this, this great revolutionary developed meditation and heat through spiritual practice and yoga activities in the cave of Sitamai like Maharishi for two years
 yahi vah samay tha, jab raju ne vanavaasiyon or girijanon kii thhida ko kareeb se janaa
 Motivated them to stand up
 raju ke krantikari saathiyon main biraiyadora kaa naam vikhyath he
 Biraiyadaura initially had its own organization
 vah bhi vanavaasiyon kaa hi ek sanghathan tha, jinhone angrejon se yuddh moed rakhaa tha
 This is in the year 1918
 ananthar angrejon ne biraiyadora ko ek muthaed main giraftaar kar liya, use jail main rakhaa, lekin vah jail kii diwaar kudakar jangalon main bhaag gaya
 After this, Biraiyadoura continued to fight with the British power by linking with the party
 jisamen wo dobaaraa jail bhej die gaye
 The British used to hang Biraiahdaura, but at that time Sitaram Raju's organization had become very strong
 police raju se tharathar kaanpati thi
 He openly challenged British power
 kaidi biraiyadora ke liye bhi usne angrej satta ko pehle se soochna bhijwa di thi ki ‘main biraiya ko reeha karwaakar rahoonga
 Stop if you have enough ’ vahi hua
 One day when the police team was taking Biraiya to court by handcuffing, Sitaram Raju attacked the police unit
 donon taraf se goliyaan chalin, lekin goliyon kii bauchhaar main bhi police dasta raju kaa bal baankaa na kar sakaa or vah dindfade khuleam chhadkar biraiyadora ko ouda le gaya
 Raju and Biraiya's search for English power remained a problem
 police chaape vifal hote rahe
 The British announced a cash reward of ten thousand rupees in newspapers and advertisements to catch it
 san 192224 main yah dhanrashi ek kida pralobhan tha
 Gandhiji had rightly said for Raju that 'sacrifice of that heroic sacrifice, troublesome life, truth, service, dedication, loyalty and indomitable courage is inspiring for us'
 subhaashachandr bose ne kaha tha ‘deshvasi us apratim yoddha ke sammaan main vinat hon
 His dedication, patriotism, boundless endurance and mighty pride are dignified
 seetaram raju ke sangharsh or kranti kii safalataa kaa ek kaaran yah bhi tha ki vanavaasi apane netaa ko dhokhaa dena, unke saath vishwasghaat karnaa nahin jaanate the
 No normal person became an informer or a traitor
 andhra ke rampa kshetra ke sabhi vanavaasi raju ko bharsak aashray, aatmasamarthak dete rahete the
 What a huge contribution that those innocent homeless, clothless and proletariat communities have made in that fiddle of freedom struggle, that they did not accept to arrest Raju even after eating British cod and latghuns
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj bhi godavari paar rampa kshetra main koi aadmi vishwaas nahin karata ki raju kabhi paqada gaya tha or use east coast special police ke chif kunchu menon ne goli maar di
 After the release of revolutionary Biraiya from British captivity, the two revolutionaries Raju and Biraiya united and started working together
 ab raju kii shakti duguni ho gai
 Two other revolutionary Gam Mallu Daura and Gam Gantan Daura also joined Raju's party
 chaaron ne sanyukt chhapemari ke silsile aise chale ki angrej damankaaree trast ho uthe
 He could not kill or arrest even a single man of Raju, and Raju continued to chew the British power for many years
 krantikari seetaram raju ne andhra kshetra ke saiqadon naujavaanon main kranti kii alakh jagaai thi
 The young men stood together at Raju's behest, historical evidence of which is available in the Telugu weekly Congress published in Telugu in 1928 and 1929 in Andhra
 sampadak paduri annapurnayya ne likhaa he ki andhra ke naujavaanon ne agar kisi vyakti ke nirdesan main angrejon se khadai jari rakhi to vah seetaram raju hi tha or andhra ke itihaas main vah pratham sangram tha
 Revolutionary Raju approached the revolutionaries of Uttarakhand with his organization as a wayfarer of the Viplav Path
 yahi nahin gadar party ke netaa baba prithvi singh ko dakshin bharat kii raaj mahendri jail se oudane kaa bharsak prayaas kiya
 Sitaram Raju used to fight the guerrilla system and meddled in the Nallaimallai hills
 godavari nadi ke paas faili yah pahadeyan raju va uske saathiyon kii ashrayadatri va prashikshan kendra donon thi
 It was here that he learned the skills of war, practiced and devised an attack strategy
 isi jagah ko rampa kaha jaataa tha
 The British called him Rampa Fituri due to Raju being dodged and extinct in the hills
 british afasar raju se lagaataar maat khate rahe
 The Andhra police had proved futile in front of Raju
 ant main kerala kii malabar police ke daste raju par lagaae gaye, kyonki unhen parvatiy ilaakon main chaape maarane kaa anubhav tha
 On 12 October 1922, these squads were sent to the valley of the Nallaimallai hills
 malabar police force se raju kii kai muthaeden huin
 In these, the Malabar squads had to suffer
 uske baad bhi police raju ko giraftaar nahin kar saki
 On 6 May 1924, Raju's contingent was confronted with the equipped Assam Rifles, in which his companions were martyred, but Raju survived
 ab east coast special police use paharyon ke chappechappe main khoj rahi thi
 On 7 May 1924, while he was wandering in the lonely forest, suddenly, in search of him, the sight of the then officer of the force, while filtering the forest mountains, fell on Raju
 usne raju kaa chhipakar peechha kiya
 Although he could not recognize Raju, because at that time Raju had increased his length
 police dal ne raju par peeche se goli chalaai
 Raju was injured and fell there
 tab raju ne swayan apana parichay dete hue kaha ki ‘main hi seetaram raju hum’ giraftaar ke saath hi yatnaaen shuru hui
 Eventually that great revolutionary was tied to a tree on the banks of the river and roasted
 ek krantikari kii isse shreshth shahadat or kya ho sakati thi
 Evidence of this sacrifice was the Godavari river and the Nallaimallai hills, where Alluri Sitaram Raju is still alive
 vanavaasiyon kii aatma main devtaa swaroop
 In folklore as Loknayak

 maharani durgavati kalinger ke raja kirtisingh chandel kii ekmaatr santan thim
 She was named Durgavati because of her birth on Durgashtami in 1524 AD at Kalinjar Fort in Banda district
 naam ke anuroop hi tej, saahas, shaury or sundarata ke kaaran inaki prasiddhi sab ore fail gayi
 The castes of the maiden and in-laws of Durgavati were different but still impressed by the fame of Durgavati, King Sangram Shah Madavi of Gondwana Empire married his son Dalpat Shah Madavi, making him his daughter-in-law
 durbhagyavash vivaah ke chaar varsh baad hi raja dalpatshaah kaa nidhan ho gaya
 At that time, there was only three-year-old Narayan in Durgavati's lap

 The great Mughal ruler Akbar also wanted to conquer the kingdom and put the queen in his harem
 usne vivaad prarambh karne hetu rani ke priy safed hathi or unke vishwast vajeer aadharsingh ko bhent ke rup main apane paas bhejne ko kaha
 The queen turned down this demand is par akbar ne apane ek rishtedaar asaf khan ke netritv main gondvanaa samrajya par hamalaa kar diya
 Once Asaf Khan was defeated, but the next time he attacked with double army and preparedness
 durgavati ke paas us samay bahut kam sainik the
 He led a front along the Narai drain near Jabalpur and himself led the war in disguise
 is yuddh main 3,000 mughal sainik maare gayi lekin rani kii bhi apaar kshati hui thi
 The next day, on 24 June 1564, the Mughal army again attacked
 aaj rani kaa paksh durbal tha, atah rani ne apane putr narayan ko surakshit sthaan par bhej diya
 When an arrow hit his arm, the queen threw it out
 duusare tir ne unki aankh ko bedh diya, rani ne ise bhi nikaala par uski nok aankh main hi rah gayi
 Just then, the third arrow hit his neck and fell
 rani ne ant samay nikat jaanakar vajeer aadharsingh se aagrah kiya ki vah apni talwaar se unki gardan kaat de, par vah iske liye taiyaar nahin hua
 Therefore, the queen went on the path of self-sacrifice by biting her dagger in her own chest
 maharani durgavati ne akbar ke senapati aasaf khan se ladakar apni jaan ganvaane se pehle pandrah varshon tak shashan kiya tha

 haidar ali dwaara mysore par kiye gaye ek hamale main nayak ko chitradurg se haath dhonaa padaa or ali ke putr tipu sultan dwaara unki hatya kar di gayi
 The city of Chitradurga was under siege by Hyder Ali's forces during the reign of Madkari Nayak
 haidar ali ne ek mahila ko chattaanon ke bich chhed se chitradurg main pravesh karte dekha or apane sainikon ko bhi usee maarg se andar bhej diya
 The guard of the scaffolding near that hole had gone home for lunch
 ghar par pani na hone ke kaaran uski patni obawwa baahar nikali
 En route, he saw Hyder Ali's soldiers entering the fort through a hole
 She did not want to disturb her husband's food, so she picked up one oak and started killing the soldiers trying to enter the fort one by one
 bhojan se lautne ke baad obawwa kaa pati uske haath main khun se sane onek or aasapaas pade saikadon mrit sainikon ko dekhakar sakate main aa gaya
 This story and Tanniru Doni - a miniature source of water which keeps cold water throughout the year - are quite famous in the folklore
 haidar ali ne 1799 main phir hamalaa kiya or kile par kabja kar liya
 This place is famous for its Kallina coat and a seven-round fort is also located here which is made of big rocks
 chitradurg paleyagaar parivaar bida yaa boyaar jatiyon se sambandhit tha or shikaar tathaa pashu-paalan dwaara apana jivan-yaapan karne vaale pahari kabeelon main se ek tha
 Nothing is clear about their origin
 ek parampara ke anusaar, teen bida parivaar 1475 ke aasapaas tirupati ke jadical-durg se pravaas karke bharamasanagar ke nikat nirutadi main bas gaye
 He was allegedly from the Kamagetti family and the Valmiki gotra
 iname se ek kaa putr or pota, hire hanummappa nayak tathaa timmanna nayak devangare taluk ke matti main bas gaye
 The latter was known as Kamagetti Timmanna Nayaka and was appointed as the hero of Holalakare, later Hiriyur and finally Chitradurga by the king of Vijayanagar
 usne chitradurg kii pahari kii kilabandi kar di or kuch is prakaar kaa aacharan karne laga ki raja ko uske khilaaf ek sena bhejni padi
 ek anya vivaran ke anusaar, timmanna nayak tirupati ke nikat ek ghat ke neeche sthit madkeri naamak sthaan se sashastr logon kii ek choti tukdi ke saath aayaa tha or basswpattanam ke paaleyagar ke yahaan kaam karne laga
 Later, due to a dispute arising out of his concubine in Matti, he left the place and settled in Mykonda
 vahaan bhi peechha kiye jane ke kaaran vah guntur ke nikat jangal main bhaag gaya or apni ek toli banane ke baad us kshetra main lutpaat kerani shuru kar di or haleyur ke nikat rangpatna naamak ek chote kile kaa nirmaan kiya
 The neighboring Paleyagaras of Harapanahalli, Nidugal and Basavapattana, fed up with this plunder, united against him and with the help of some of the Vijayanagara armies, attacked Rangapatna
 timmanna nayak ko chitradurg bhaagna padaa jahaan uski sampurna gheraabandi kar di gayi
 The said incident took place at the same time, which gave rise to his identity as a chieftain who depended on Vijayanagar
 yah lagbhag 1562 kii baat he
 Timmanna Nayak entered the camp at night with the intention of stealing the horse of Prince Saluva Nursing Raya of Vijayanagar, who led the army against him, to establish his identity
 rajkumaar jag gaya or timmanna ko pakade jane se bachane ke liye puaal ke dher main chhupana padaa
 rajkumaar ne khunti or rassi ko jameen main thodaa aage kii taraf kar diya jisase anjaane main hi timmanna hawa main latak gaya
 Still Timmanna remained silently hidden and after everything was quiet, he freed himself by cutting his hanging hand and stole the horse
 uske is krity ne gheraabandi karne vaali sena ko yah ehsaas dilaayaa ki timmanna ko bhaybheet nahin kiya ja saktaa
 kehete hai ki uske baad shanti kii sthapana ho gayi
 The king of Vijayanagara invited Timmanna to the capital and praised his courageous act
 raja ke anurodh par, timmanna nayak ne apane agle kadam ke rup main gulburg par kabja kiya, jise vijaynagar kii senaayen chah maheene kii gheraabandi ke baad bhi jeet paane main vifal rahi thim
 Pleased with this, the king invited Timmanna to the court
 timmanna ko baad main kisi karanvash raja kii naaraazgi kaa saamana karnaa padaa or use vijaynagar main kaid kar diya gaya, jahaan uski mrityu ho gayi
 Timmanna Nayak was succeeded by his son Obana Nayak
 He named himself Madakeri Nayaka and within a few years of assuming the throne declared his independence from the Vijayanagara Empire
 1602 main, obaana nayak ke baad uske putr kasturi rangappa nayak ne gaddi sanbhali
 uskaa puraa shasankaal padosi raajaaon ke saath sangharsh se bharaa hua tha
 Along with the Palayagara of Basavapattana, several battles were fought over several places like Mayakonda, Santebennur, Holalkere, Anaji, and Jagalur and all these places eventually remained part of the Chitradurga region
 1652 main apni mrityu ke samay obaana kii sampattiyon se 65,000 durgi pagoda kaa rajasav aata tha
 Rangappa Nayak was succeeded by his son Madakeri Nayak in 1652; Madakeri Nayaka is also credited with many victories, especially in the eastern regions
 During his reign, the kingdom was divided into four regions
 in kshetron ke sthaneey adhikari hotte gurukanna, kaaranika bhunppa, abbiger mallanna, tathaa kaaranika appanna the
 Rangappa died in 1674 and his inheritance brought a revenue of 100,000 Durga Pagodas
 madkeri nayak kii koi santan nahin thi or unke baad unke dattak putr obaana nayak chitradurg kii gaddi par baithe the
 Obana was killed by Dalavis, possibly for not offering the customary offerings
 madkeri nayak ke ek chote bhai chikkanna nayak ko 1676 main gaddi par bithaaya gaya
 At that time, the leader of Harapanahalli attacked Anaji and killed Bhunappa, the local officer
 chikkanna nayak anaji aaye or shatru ko gheraabandi rokane par majaboor kar diya
 Soon after, he had to go to Harihar to thwart an attack by Muslims led by Shamsher Khan
 The following strategies were adopted for immunity: Many torches were lit at night and tied to tree branches and musicians were asked to play their instruments as usual in the Chikkanna camp at Bereguda Hill
 aisa yah jataane ke liye kiya gaya tha ki sena aage nahin badi he
 The hero led his entire army through a winding path and attacked the fort from the western direction and drove the enemy
 chikkanna ne raayadurg or basswpattana saradaaron ke saath shaadi gathbandhan kiya
 The Chitradurga family is said to have changed their religious beliefs twice during the reign of this hero
 pehle puure parivaar ne virashaiv aasthaa ko apanaaya, yahaan tak ki nayak ne kile ke andar ek math kaa bhi nirmaan karavaaya or ugrachannaviradeva naamak ek virakt jangma ko apane paariwarik guru ke rup main niyukt kiya
 Later, almost all people returned to their original religion
 1686 main chikkanna nayak kii mrityu ho gai
 His elder brother Linganna Nayak, known as Madakeri Nayak III after Chikkanna Nayak, took over the throne
 At that time there was a big difference of opinion among the Dalawans about the rightful heir to the throne
 panchamaara muddanna ke netritv vaale ek samooh ne linganna nayak ko pehle to karawas main daalaa or phir uski hatya karvaa di or donne rangappa nayak ko singhaasana par bitha diya
 Muddanna remained the most powerful person of Chitradurga till Dalavayi Bharamappa's faction came to power
 muddanna or uske bhaaiyon k jald hi khatm kar diya gaya or donne rangappa ko kaid kar liya gaya
 Dalvayi Bharamappa was interested in the integrity of the state
 singhaasana kaa koi pratyaksh uttaradhikari na hone ke kaaran, usne darbar ke anya bujurg sadasyon ke paraamarsh ke saath bharamppa nayak naamak ek dur ke rishtedaar ko pesh kiya
 The new hero ascended the throne around 1689
 This was a difficult time for the state; At the same time, the Mughals defeated Bijapur and formed their government in Sira and made Basavapattana and Budihal its pargana and Chitradurga and other neighboring states of Paleyagar became its tributaries

 isa se lagbhag 600 varsh purv yunaan nivasee theliz is baat se parichit the ki kuch vastuen ragadne ke pashchaat halaki vastuon ko aakarshith karti hai
 It was mentioned by Theaprastus in 321 BC
 i and Pliny did it in the year 70
 is aakarshan shakti kaa adhyayan 16 veen shatabdi main wiliam gilbert dwaara hua tathaa unhone ise 'electric' kaha
 The modern word 'electron' is used in Greek for ambar
 'electricity' shabd kaa upyog san 1650 main walter sharlton ne kiya
 At the same time Robert Biel discovered that charged objects also attract light objects to zero, that is, it is not necessary to be an air medium for the effect of electricity
 san 1729 main steefan grey ne apane prayogon ke aadhaar par kaha ki yah aakarshan shakti kisi vastu ke ek bhaag se duusare bhaag ko sanchaarit kii ja sakati he
 Desaguliers called such objects as 'drivers'
 sabhi prakaar kii dhaatuen is shrenee main aati hai
 The objects in which this power cannot be transmitted are called insulators
 is shrenee main ambar, mom, sukhi hawa, sookhaa kaanch, rabar, lakh ityadi hai
 Due to rubbing of objects, there are two types of electricity, positive and negative
 pehle inke kramash: kachabh tathaa rejini naam prachlit the
 In 1737, Dufé stated that homogeneous charges repel each other and attract foreigners
 1745 main clist ne cumin main, macenbrook ne liden main, tathaa wiliam watasan ne landan main kaha ki vidyut kaa sanchay bhi kiya ja saktaa he, inke prayogon tathaa vichaaron ne prasiddh sanchayak liden jaar ko janm diya
 At about this time efforts were also being made to get adequate amount of electricity and various types of electrical devices were invented
 wilia vatsan kaa vichaar tha ki vidyut ek prakaar kaa pratyasth taral hoti he jo prayek vastu main vidyaman hoti he
 It is in ordinary quantity in chargeless objects, hence it cannot be inspected
 watasan ke taral siddhant ke anusaar vidyut ek vastu se duusari vastu main chali jaati he
 American scientist and politician Benjamin Franklin extended this theory by supporting it
 franklin ne kaha ki vidyut na to utpann kii ja sakati he, na nasht hi
 Franklin tried to study the Leiden jar to explain its action
 par franklin kaa sabase prasiddh evam mahatvapurn vah prayog tha, sisamen unhone siddh kiya ki meghon se meghgarjan ke samay vidyut tathaa saadhaaran vidyut ke gun samaan hai
 He also said that electric particles exert force on each other
 franklin ke pashchaat apinus ne in vichaaron ko liya tathaa iskaa abhas diya ki do vastuon kaa bal unke bich kii duuri badhaane par ghat jaataa he
 This theory was expanded by Jajeff Priestley and Henry Cavendish
 phir kulom ne khoj kii ki do aaveshon ke bich kaa bal, unke bich kii duuri ke varg ke vyutakramanupati tathaa aaveshon ke gunanfal ke samaanupati hota he
 This basic law of electricity is still called 'balonium of Coulom'
 san 1837 main maaikel farade ne kinhin do aaweshit vastuon ke bich ke vidyut bal par madhyam ke prabhaav kaa adhyayan kiya tathaa pataa lagaaya ki yadi madhyam hawa ke sthaan par koi or vidyutarodhi ho to vidyut bal ghat jaataa he, vidyut rodhi ke is gun ko unhone 'vishisht parvaidyutta' athwa paraavidhyut kaha
 He demonstrated, by his famous use of icebergs, that if a charged conductor is brought into a vessel, an internal charge is induced on the inside of the vessel and a homogeneous charge on the outside
 farade ne paraavidhyut kaa gahan adhyayan kiya tathaa unke vibhinn prabhaavon ko samajhane ke liye vidyut bal rekhaon kaa vichaar upasthit kiya tathaa aaweshit vastuon ke bich ke khaali sthaan ko 'kshetra' kaha
 Gauss advanced Faraday's field theory with the help of mathematics
 aththarahavin shatabdi ke antim varshon main aaveshon ke chalan ke sambandh main kai prayog tathaa siddhant prakaash main aane lage the
 In 1780, Italy's Lugi Galvani made several experiments of electric current over the paddock
 san 1800 main volta ne tanu amla athwa lavan vilyan se bhigi hui do asmaan dhaatuon main vidyut prabhaav paae tathaa unase vidyut dhara praapt kii
 To multiply this electric current, he made a bridge called joints of many dissimilar metals called voltaic masses
 volta dwaara in prayogon ke anusaar vidyuddhara praapt karne ke liye 'voltiy cell' kii rachana hui
 In the same year in England, Nicholson and Carlyle discovered that if an electric current were to flow in water, the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen
 aise apghaton ko vaidyut apghaton kehete hai
 Crookeshack discovered that the metal particles of the solution can also be decomposed in a similar way
 iske pashchaat farade ne is kriya kaa niyamit adhyayan kiya tathaa 'farade ke niyamon' kii sthapana kii
 Based on these rules or related experiments, different types of cells and accumulators producing electric currents have been designed
 san 1820 main hens chrishchiyan arsted ne khoj kiya ki ek taar main pravaahit vidyut dhara ke saath usase sambandhit ek chumbakeey kshetra bhi hota he
 This important discovery was carried forward by Kipro and Sawar and Ampere with the help of mathematics and experiments
 ampiore ne yah dikhaaya ki do samaantar taron main vidyut dhara kii disha samaan hone par aakarshan tathaa vipareet hone par pratikarshan hota he
 Arstad's theories were developed by Faraday and established the laws of electro-magnetic induction
 preran kaa adhyayan baad main niman tathaa webar ne bhi kiya parantu prarena sambandhi vichaaron kaa mahatvapurn upyog clark maxwell ne san 1851 main kiya tathaa 'maxwell samikarnon' kii sthapana kar vidyucchumbakeey siddhanton ko ganit kii sahaayta se ek sulajhaa hua rup diya
 These equations have a special place in modern physics
 san 1822 main jebec ne dekha ki yadi ek paripath main do asmaan dhaatuon ko jod diya jaae or ek jod ko garam kiya jaae to paripath main vidyut pravaahit hoti he
 Such electricity is called 'heat electric'
 san 1826 main george simon om ne prasiddh 'om ke niyam' kii sthapana kii
 In 1841, Joule studied the heat effect of electricity and stated that the chemical energy of a cell, which flows in a circuit, is equal to the heat energy produced in that circuit
 helm holtz, wiliam tomson, kelvin, lorden, aadi ne vidyut urja sambandhi anya siddhanton kaa vikaas kiya
 In 1848, Kirkhhaf introduced rules regarding electrification
 san 1851 main lard kelvin ne ooshmaa vidyut kaa ooshmaagatiki ke siddhaton dwaara vishleshan kiya
 In 1855, the idea of electrical and macroeconomic ideas was laid by Maxwell
 san 1884 main jon henry paniting ne vidyut chumbakeey kshetra main urja pravaah kaa adhyayan kiya
 Maxwell's theories gained experimental support in 1886 with the help of Heinrich Herts

 Subsequently, substantial progress was made in this subject, which resulted in the development of radio, television and 'electronics'
 herts ke anya prayogon ne 'prakashavidyut' kii bhi khoj kii jisko instin ne kwantum siddhanton dwaara san 1905 main samajhaayaa
 In 1895 and around the same time a revolutionary movement came in the field of physics
 san 1895 main rantagen ne 'eksre' kaa, 1896 main bekrel ne ne radioskriyata kaa tathaa 1897 main sar je
je
 tomson ne 'electron' kaa avishkaar kiya
 Tamson also studied the topic of electrification from gases
 is vishay main inase pehle, aarambh main gislar, plakar, hitorph, goldstin aadi ne kaary kiya tha
 Chief among the later scientists is JS Townsend and his companions
 san 1902 main richardsan ne 'tapayanic' vishay kii neenv daali
 Radio valves and other electronics valves have been formed on the principle of 'heating current'
 beesvin shatabdi main ek ke pashchaat ek mahatvapurn khojon kaa taanta bandh gaya jinke parinaam swaroop aaj ke hydrogen bam, sangalan urja, 'sputanik' tathaa anya upgrah ityadi
