 If the cause cannot be determined with sufficient certainty, a biopsy will be recommended

 Although mammography is the only method for breast cancer screening that can save lives, it is not accurate
 mammography dwaara pahchaan se batch nikle cancer rogiyon kii sankhya aamtaur par 10% se 30% he
 This means that out of 350 women in whom breast cancer is found per 1 xxrep 5 0 women, about 35 to 105 could not detect cancer by mammography
 Reasons for the cancer not being detected include the observer's omission, but it happens multiple times that breast cancer lurks in the other dense tissue of the breast and is not visible even after retrospective review of mammograms
 In addition, one form of breast cancer is the development of lobular cancer, which casts a shadow on mammograms, and it is not possible to separate them from normal breast tissue

 Studies released by British researchers on 1 October 2008 showed that using CAD in conjunction with a physician reading once may be as beneficial as reading twice a physician

 Of the 227 cancer patients detected, out of 199 cases of cancer diagnosed by two different physicians, the number of patients diagnosed by CAD method was just one less
 acha The goal of any screening procedure is to examine a large number of patients and to detect patients with potentially serious conditions
 in rogiyon ko aage ke aamtaur par adhik tivrata vaale pareekshan ke liye bheja jaataa he
 Thus, the purpose of screening test is not conclusive, but its purpose is high sensitivity, so that there is no mistake in detecting any cancer
 This high sensitivity results in relatively large numbers of outcomes, causing patients without the disease to be regarded as suspect
 yahi mammography kaa sach he
 Sometimes patients are called back for a further test after a screening session, sometimes referred to as "false positives" and an erroneous indication
 vastav main, yah kai swasth marijon ko aage kii jaanch ke liye isliye bulaanaa aavashyak he, taaki jitna sambhav ho sake cancer ke rogiyon kaa pataa lagaaya sake

 However, some women who get false positive results may have anxiety, discomfort and sadness about the possibility of getting breast cancer and such a feeling can last for many years
 isi samay, stan chitra main tumor kaa pataa lagane main chook yaa "galat nakaaratmak" dar bhi ho sakati he

 galat nakaaratmak dar kaa anumaan kai varshon tak baari sankhya main rogiyon ke bare main aage kii gahan chaanbin par nirbhar hai
 This is quite difficult in practice, as many women do not regularly return for mammography, which makes it difficult to find out if they had cancer
 Dr
 Samuel S
 Iptin, in his book The Politics of Cancer, has claimed that one out of four women in every mammography in women aged 40 to 49 failed to detect cancer
 Researchers have found that breast tissue is quite dense in young women and lumps are difficult to detect
 is kaaran se, rajonivritti se pehle karaaye gayi stan chithran main galat nakaaratmak report do baar tak ho sakati he
 This is why in the UK, screening programs do not start calling women for screening programs until the age of 50

 Research on the related condition shows that even small cancers, which were not immediately started with diagnostic work, but monitored for a period of several years, showed good results
 a group of 3184 women was mammogramed, who were formally classified as "potentially early"
 rogiyon kaa yah vargeekaran spasht rup se saamaanya nahin hai, lekin isamen maamuli chintaa ke kuch kshetra shaamil hai
 In these results, the patients were not biopsied, but the results of mammography were monitored every six months for three years, so that no changes could be guaranteed
 Of these 3184 women, 17 had cancer
 sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki jab inkaa pataa lagaaya gaya to ye abhi bhi 0 yaa 1 ke shuruuaati charan main the
 There was no evidence of recurrence in any of these 17 women after five years of treatment

 The majority of health experts believe that the risk of breast cancer for low-risk women under the age of 35 is not so high that they have to bear the risk of the potential ill effects of radiation
 For this reason and in women younger than 35, the radiation sensitivity of the breast is probably higher than in older women, so most radiologists do not perform mammography in women under 40
 However, if there is a significant risk of cancer in a particular patient, then mammography may still be important
 aksar, radiologist ultrasound yaa emarai imaging kaa upyog karke mammography se bachane kii koshish karte hai
 Statistics regarding mammography and women between the ages of 40 and 55 have been the most controversial
 1992 main canada ke rashtriya stan cancer adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki mammography 50 se 60 umr kii mahilaon kii mrityu dar par sakaaratmak prabhaav nahin tha
 This study, however, was done only to achieve this result
 adhyayan ke aalochakon ne kaha ki isamen bahut hi gambhir prakaar kii khamiyaan thim, jinase ye parinaam galat sabit hue
 There is also evidence that clearly shows that during the screening of women, excessive exercise was done to identify cancer
 is tarah ke cancer in mahilaon ko unke puure jeevankaal main kabhi prabhavit nahin karte
 jab 2000 mahilaon ko 10 saal kii naidanik prakriya se guzarana padaa to unamem se 10 main stan cancer ke nidaan ke liye jarurat se zyada naidanik prakriya apanaai gai or jaan bachaane ke liye anaavashyak chikitsa kii gai
 Although screening of women between 40 and 50 is still controversial, the number of evidence indicates that it has little benefit in the early detection of the disease
 vartmaan main, american cancer sosayadi, neshnal cancer insticute or american college of radiology 40 se 49 varsh kii umr kii mahilaon ko har 2 saal par memmography ke liye protsaahit karte hai
 Conversely, the American College of Physicians, a large group of physicians, recently encouraged individual screening schemes, in contrast to screening women aged 40 to 49 every two years at wholesale prices
 haal hi main america priventive sarvice task force ne kaha ki 40 se 50 varsh kii mahilaon ke liye niyamit jaanch karana aavashyak nahin he
 Their report states that the benefits of testing before the age of 50 are not more important than the risks
debate over the use of mammography as a stan cancer kaa praarambhik avasthaa main hi pataa lagane kii jaanch ke upkaran ke rup main mammography ke upyog par bahes jari he
 Critics say a large number of women need to be screened to detect cancer
 kopans hamen yaad dilaate han ki 1990 ke baad se stan cancer se maut dar main 30% kii giravat ai he or sweden tathaa netherland main kiye gayi adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki mammography screening ke kaaran cancer se hone vaali mauton main do tihaai kii kami ai he
 Keane & Keane indicated that repeated mammography from the beginning of the age of 50 was successful in saving the lives of 1
8 out of 1000 women examined for 15 years
 This result should be seen against negative errors in diagnosis, excessive treatment and exposure to radiation
 Critics argue that its benefits are greater
 screening ke kocharen vishleshan se sanket miltaa he ki yah "spasht nahin he ki screening se nuksaan kii tulana main zyada phayda hota he
 "according to their analysis, one in 2000 women will have a life of 10 years longer due to screening, however another 10 healthy women will unnecessarily undergo breast cancer treatment
 Newman points out that screening of mammography does not reduce mortality overall, but Fearing cancer causes significant damage and unnecessary surgical interventions
 ant main, haal ke ek ek mahatvapurn lekh se pataa chalata he ki ek safal screening kaarykram kaa parinaam stan cancer kii shuruaati daur ke maamalon kii sankhya badhani chahie or saath main baad kii avasthaa ke cancer kii sankhya main kami aani chahie

 Criticism or critique is the literary mode of discussing an object / subject, keeping its goal in view, its merits and demerits and suitability
 hindi aalochana kii shuruyaat 19veen sadi ke uttarardh main bharatendu yug se hi maani jaati he
 'criticism' literally means 'to look well'
 'aalochana' shabd 'luch' dhaatu se bana he
 'luch' means 'to see'
 samiksha or samalochna shabdon kaa bhi yahi arth he
 'criticism' is treated as a synonym for the term 'criticism' in English
 sanskrit main prachlit 'tikaa-vyakhya' or 'kavy-siddhantanirupan' ke liye bhi aalochana shabd kaa prayog kar liya jaataa he kintu acharya ramachandra shukla kaa spasht mat he ki aadhunik aalochana, sanskrit ke kavy-siddhantanirupan se swatantra chiz he
 The task of criticism is to examine a literary work thoroughly and determine its form, population and economy
 doctor shyamsundar das ne aalochana kii paribhaasha in shabdon main di he: That is, the duty of criticism is a literary interpretation of a literary work
 sahityakar jivan or anbhuv ke jin tatwon ke sanshleshan se sahitya rachana karata he, aalochana unheen tatwon kaa vishleshan karti he
 Where literature is dominant in literature, there is an element of wisdom in criticism
 aalochana aitihaasik, saamaajik, raajnneetik paristhitiyon or shistayon kaa bhi akalan karti he or sahitya par unke padane vaale prabhaavon kii vivechna karti he
 Condemning or criticizing a work based on personal interest is not a religion of criticism
 kriti kii vyakhya or vishleshan ke liye aalochana main paddati or pranali kaa mahatva hota he
 While criticizing, the critic can avoid his personal rage, disinterest, disinterest, only when he follows the method, he can only do justice to literature by being objective
 is drushti se hindi main acharya ramachandra shukla ko sarvshereshth aalochak mana jaataa he
 The types of criticism develop according to the beliefs and practices that are accepted when criticizing
 saamanyat: samiksha ke chaar prakaaron ko sweekaar kiya gaya he:- Theories of literature are considered in theoretical criticism
 isamen pracheen shastreey kaavyagon - ras, alankaar aadi or sahitya kii aadhunik manyataon tathaa niyamon kii mukhya rup se vivchena kii jaati he
 In theoretical criticism the point of consideration is whether the criterion of literature is classical or historical
 maandand kaa shastreey rup, sthir or aparivartansheel hota he kintu mandandon ko aitihaasik shrenee maananaper unka swaroop parivartansheel or vikasaatmak hota he
 Both types of theoretical criticisms are available
 kintu ab usee saiddhanthik aalochana kaa mahatva adhik he jo sahitya ke tatwon or niyamon kii aitihaasik prakriya main vikasman maanati he
 When literature is decided on the basis of certain principles, it is called judgmental criticism
 ise ek prakaar kii naitik aalochana bhi mana jaataa he
 Its main nature is to pass judgment on literary works like a judge
 aisi aalochana praaia: hi siddhanth kaa yantric dhang se upyog karti he
 Therefore, the importance of decisive criticism decreases
 yadhyapi mulya yaa shreshth sahitya or nikrusht sahitya kaa bodh paidaa karnaa aalochana ke pradhan dharmon main se ek he lekin vah siddhanton ke yantric upyog se nahin sabhanv he
 In the 'hindi Sahitya Kosh', the subject of decisive criticism is told: is prakaar aalochana main nirnay vivaad kaa bindu utana nahin he jitna nirnay ke liye apanaaya gaya tarika
 Like, there is value judgment in Ramchandra Shukla's criticism, but his method is creative, not mechanical
 nirnayaatmak aalochana main mulya or tarika, donon kii main lacheelaapan nahin hota
 In this critique, the effect of poetry on critic Cayman makes him busy with the stylish designation
 isamen vayactik ruchi hi mukhya he
 Effective Criticism is not an object of shock
 na gyaan ke kshetra main uskaa mulya he na bhav ke kshetra main

 The story of Dilios continues, according to which a Persian envoy pleads with King Zerkias's order of "land and water" at the threshold of Sparta, otherwise threatening him to become a wrath of the wrath; Sparta kicks the messenger and his soldiers into the blind well in this battle
 leonidas tab afars naamak pande-pujaariyon se milane jaataa he, taaki vah yah ranneeti samajha saken ki vah un farsiyon kii vishaal sena ko bhi desh seemaadwar se peeche hataa sakate hai; yojana ke mutabik vah aisi tang galiyare kii diwaar kaa nirmaan karenge jisase farsiyon kii fouj chattaanon or samudr ke raste funs jaaen
 The enforcers then listen to the oracles' prophecy for consultation, who make their decree that it would not be right for the Spartans to go to war during Carnia
 hataasha or gusse se bharaa leonidas ke lautate hi, unke peeche xerqies kaa doot aa jaataa he, jo afars ko unke prachhnn sahyog ke liye bataur inaam detaa he
 Although mobilizing his Spartan soldiers without the permission of the Enforcers, Leonidas makes up his bodyguard by making excuses from the three hundred best soldiers he has chosen; Moves to the Arcade

 Among them, Stelios, an elite Sparta soldier named, tells the Persians to return from the border and warns of punishment for cutting off the arm in the name of Zerkys
 isi dauraan, leonidas kii mulaakaat efialtis, naam ke kurup spartavasi se hoti he jise shaayad uske abhibhavakon ne sparta ke kanoon anusaar shishu hatya se bachaane ke liye vahaan se bhaag nikle the
 For the same emancipation of his father, Apialtis pretends to be reinstated from Leonidas into the army, but Leonidas warns him that he may at any time become a sacrificial victim to the Pharisees, causing the whole Sparta army to fall under siege
 usapar taras khaakar, leonidas uske shaareerik aakshamata ko dekhte hue inkaar kar detaa he kyonki vah apni dhaal jarurat hisaab se unchaa uthaa nahin paata; jiske liye sainya vyuh rachana main jaruri sambhaavna honi chahie, efialtis yah sun behad khafa ho jaataa he
 Soon the battle begins when the Spartans refuse to surrender weapons
 ekmaatr pravesh maarg ke tang raaston kaa unhen bakhubi laabh miltaa he, or apni behtareen yuddh kaushal ke balboote, sparton apane veg se samooche farsiyon kii phujon kii lahar ko bhi peeche dhakel detii
 At the end of the war, Zerkias himself meets Leonidas and asks him to surrender, believing his loyalty to the country in exchange for an offer of wealth and power; Leonidas turns down the offer and ridicules Zerkys as a mockery by calling his warriors to be inferior
