 a synchronous motor or synchronous motor is an alternating current-driven electric motor
 iskaa naam tulyakalika motor yaa sincronas motor is kaaran he kyonki iske roter kii ghurnan gati thik-thik utani hi hoti he jitani stater main nirmit ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii gati hoti he
 This motor is often not used to rotate a load, but is used to improve the power coefficient
 vishesh sthitiyon main iskaa upyog lod chalaane main bhi kiya jaataa he
 Synchronous speed, jahaan: The main parts of a synchronous motor are the stator and rotor
 isaki stater bhi preran motor ke samaan hi hoti he jis par teen-feji vinding kii gayi hoti he
 The magnetic field is generated either by a permanent magnet on the rotor or by giving DC to the electromagnets built on the rotor
 baahar se is disi ko roter par laane ke liye slip ring kaa prayog karnaa padataa he
 In large motors, a DC generator is placed on the same shaft
 isse praapt disi ko roter par bane vidyutchumbakon ko diya jaataa he
 Depending on the design, the rotor is of two types - tulykaalik motor ko 'over-iksite' karke chalaane par iske dwaara lee gayi dhara iske voltage se agragami hoti he
 On this basis, it can be used to increase the power coefficient
 isaki sabase acchhee baat yah he ki yadi lod kaa shakti-gunank parivartit ho rahaa ho to is motor kii field-viding kii dhara ko parivartit karke iske dwaara lee jane vaali dhara kaa shakti-gunank bhi is prakaar parivartit kiya ja saktaa he ki lod tathaa yah tulykaalik motor kaa sammilit shakti-gunank 1 ho jaay
 The V-curve of the synchronous motor is shown in the front diagram
 isse spasht hota he ki roter kaa field iksitesan badalane par iske stater se lee gayi dhara kaa phej badalata he

 vijaymohan singh hindi kathakaar evam pragatisheel drushti ke swatantraeta kathalochak the
 Vijaymohan Singh was born on 1 January 1936 in Shahabad
 hindi vishay se em0e0 karne ke uparant unhone pi-ech0 di0 kii oopaadhi bhi praapt kii
 He chose the field of teaching for a livelihood and taught at the Degree College of Ara from 1960 to 1969
 april 1973 se 1975 tak dilli vishvavidhyalay ke raamalaal anand mahavidhyalay main adhyaaapak rahe
 He was an Assistant Professor at Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla from April 1975 to 1982
 1983 se 1990 tak bharat bhawan, bhopal main ‘vagarth’ kaa sanchaalan kiya
 He was Secretary of Hindi Academy, Delhi from 1991 to 1994
 unhone 1964 se 1968 tak patna se prakashit honevaali patrika ‘nai dhara’kaa sampaadan bhi kiya tha
 In addition to writing and editing, he has published some important marks of UNESCO Courier published from National Book Trust and NCERT
 Also translated Hindi biography of Raja Rammohun Roy for 25 march 2015 ko ahmedabad main unka nidhan ho gaya
 Vijaymohan Singh has been a freelance writer of progressive vision, seriously involved in story-writing as well as story-criticism
 achche kahanikar hone ke baavjood unhen apekshaakrit adhik prasiddhi aalochak ke rup main mili he
 His critical writing began mainly from 1965
 apni pehali pustak 'aaj kii kahani' se hi ve kahani-aalochana ke kshetra main sthapit ho gayi
 The plank of his criticism and action has been wide and varied
 pehali hi pustak main guleri ji tathaa premachand kii kahaniyon se lekar muktibodh, dharmaveer bharti, ramkumar, prayag shukla tathaa ramnarayan shukla jaise upekshit parantu behad achche kahanikar kii kahaniyon kaa bhi ve antardrushtipurna vishleshan karte hai
 The stories of 'char Yaar' Dudhanath Singh, Ravindra Kalia, Kashinath Singh and Gyanranjan of 'sathotari Kahani' were done in the context of craftsmanship and novelty in terms of their ambient reality as well as their bellows analysis of the critical vision in their nature
 There is something far beyond the marking and literal honesty
 da0 namvar singh ne spashtaaapurvak sweekaar kiya he ki vijaymohan ne mujhase acchhee kahani kii aalochana likhi he
 The stories of poets have been objected to due to their strong importance, but for this reason, they have also given dimension to the story, while protecting the story-criticism of Hindi from monotony to a great extent
 jaishankar prasad kii kahaniyon par ve lambe samay tak chintanarat rahe hai, jiskaa pratham parinaam 'katha samay' main sankalit utkrisht aalekh tha or baad main usee kaa parishodhit-parimarjeet rup 'jaishankar prasad kii shreshth kahaniyaan' kii bhoomika main saamne aayaa, jo nissandeh prasad ji kii kahaniyon kii rachanaatmak samarthy ko abhivyakt karne main atyadhik safal he
 In the second section of 'katha Samay', he has also considered some novels
 likhane main vijaymohan singh kaa dhang hameshaa 'ruchi ke raja' vaala hi rahaa; yahan tak ki antim pustak 'aadhunik hindi gadhy sahitya : vikaas or vishleshan' main bhi; jabaki use mukammal prabandhatmak rup main hi likhavane kaa spasht prakashkeey aagrah tha, jo uchit hi tha
 This nature of writing continued to appear in both Vijaymohan Singh's strengths and limitations
 ek ore jis kisi gadhy rachana yaa gadhykar par kuch vistaar se likhaa to praayah kuch nayaa or antardrushtipurna likhaa to duusari ore kai rachanaaon tathaa rachanakaaron par sandarbh rahete hue bhi apekshit vichaar nahin ho paaya, virodhatmak bhi nahin
 Despite this, his belligerence is an honest attempt to live up to the truth of his time and wherever the writer has found something valuable, he has not even hesitated to underline it

 The final version of the list contains anger, greed, laziness, pride, lust, jealousy and greed
 catholic carch ne paap ko do pramukh virgon main vibhakt kiya he: "kshamya paap", jo apekshaakrit kshudra hote hai or kisi bhi prakaar ke sanskarik niyamon athwa carch ke param prasad sanskaar grahan ke madhyam se kshamaa kiye ja sakate hai evam jitne adhik "ghaatak" yaa nashwar paap honge utane hi adhik sangeen honge

 In the first phase of the early 14th century, the popularity of the subject matter of the Seven Deadly Sins among European artists of the time has finally helped to assimilate into Catholic culture and Catholic consciousness in general around the world
 aatmsaat karne ke madhyamon main se aisa hi ek smarak sristi "SALIGIA" thi jo latin main saat ghaatak paapon: suparbia, evarysia, laksuriya, invidia, gula, ira, acedia par aadhaarit thi
 In the book of Proverbs, it is mentioned that the "lord" hates six things in particular and the seventh is not lost to his soul
 haalanki unamem se saat hi yahaan prastut hai, yah suchi paramparaagat suchi se ullekhneey rup se bhinn he, ahankaar hi ekmaatr paap he jo donon soochiyon main shaamil he
 This time, the list of other bad things in the Galician-provided paper contains more sins than the traditional seven sins, although the list is virtually lengthy: adultery, adultery, uncleanness, sexuality, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, differences, Enlightenment, anger, discord, treason, drunkenness, jealousy, murders, intoxication, reprisals and similar "other sins"
 saat ghaatak paapon kii aadhunik avadharana kaa sambandh chauthi sadi ke sanyasi evagriyas pontico, kii rachanaaon se hai, jinhonen greek main aath bure vichaaron kii suchi taiyaar kii thi jo nimna prakaar hai:sandarbh truti: amaanya tag; amaanya naam These bad thoughts can be divided into three categories: isvi san 590 main, ivagriyas pope gregory pratham ke kuch varshon pashchaat is suchi ko sanshodhit kar adhik aam saat ghaatak paapon kii suchi taiyaar kii gai, niraashaa kii shrenee main vishaad / hatotsaah ahankaar kii shrenee main ahmmanyata or ansayam tathaa irshyaa ko atirikt shaamil kar dhanalolupata ko suchi se nikaal diya gaya he
 Pope Gregory and Dante Alighieri, in their epic work The Divine Comedy, put the seven deadly sins dealt with in Dharmasankha in the following sequence: saat ghaatak paapon kii pahchaan or paribhaasha ke itihaas kii prakriya nirantar pravaahman he or in saaton paapon main se prayek paap samay-samay par viksit hue hai
 Additionally, as a result of: dante isi parivarddhit suchi kaa vyavhaar karte hai
 
 The process of semantics has been used because of the fact that personality traits are applied neither collectively, nor coherently, nor methodically, through the Bible itself, as well as other literary and church works
 Has been taken to search for sources from which definitions can be derived
 punarjagran ke baad se dante kii divine kamedi kaa dwitiya khand purgatorio ko lagbhag sarvamaanya sunishchit sutara mana jaataa rahaa he
 The list of sins in modern Roman Catholic theology includes: arrogance, riches, jealousy, anger, lust, longing, and laziness
 Each of these seven deadly sins now has an opposite meaning according to the seven holy virtues
 jin paapon kaa ve virodh karte hai, unke samanaantar anukram main saat gun; vinamrata, daan, dayaa, dhairya, sanyam, mitahar or shram hai
 Wastage is uncontrolled excess
 apavyayee aacharan main vilasita kii vastuon kii barbar kharid, tathaa bhrashtachar ke rup main kiye jane vaale aacharan shaamil hai
 In the languages of romance, synonyms of luxuria contain a wide sexual meaning; Old French synonyms were adopted as luxury in English, but by the 14th century it had lost its sexual meaning
 vaasana yaa vyabhichaar ko aamtaur par yon prakruti kii ichchhaaon athwa atyadhik vichaaron ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Aristotle's criterion was excessive love for others, which led to a lack of love and devotion to God
 dante ke purgatorio main, pashchaatapi lapaton ke bheetar apane andar ke kaamuk vichaaron or bhaawanaaon ko parishkrut karne ke liye chalata he
 In Dante's "fire", the unforgivable spirits of the sin of lust burn away in a ceaseless wind in symbolic winds of lustful desires of their economic life
 latin glutyar ' se vyutpann ''glutni ', jiskaa arth gatak janaa yaa nigal janaa he, glutni kaa arth nasht hone kii antim seemaa tak kisi vastu ke prati atishay-aasakti evam uskaa ati-upyog he
 In Christianity, it is considered a sin because excessive desire for food deprives the needy of getting food
 samskruti ke aadhaar par ise yaa to paap athwa haisiyat kaa pratik samajha jaataa he
 Where there is a relatively lack of food, many can feel proud by having the ability to eat more
 lekin kuch kshetron main jahaan ann kii prachurtaa he, ise atishay-aasakti kii laalasaa ko niyantrit karne ke liye aatm-sanyam kaa pratik samajha jaataa he
 Medieval church leaders took a broader view of longing, arguing that obsessive anticipation of food, and the constant craving to get and eat luscious dishes and expensive meals
 akinas ne laalach main funsane ke chah tareekon kii ek suchi taiyaar kii he, jinamein shaamil hai: Greed, also known as gluttony or hyperactivity, is considered a sin of excesses, in the form of sexuality and longing
 haalanki, laalach bahut hi adhik athwa atirek ichha evam sampati, haisiyat or takat ke peeche bhaagane par bhi lagu hota he
 St
 Thomas Akinas wrote that greed is "a sin against God, which is like all mortal sins, and which grows as much as man descends to everlasting things to obtain mortal things
" " dante kii purgetary main, anutapiyon ko apane chehron ko jameen main gaad lenaa padataa he chunki unalogon ne parthiv chintaaon par apane dhyaan adhik kendrit kiye hai
 "averis" is a derivative terminology that is more meaningful in describing many other greedy forms
 inamen vishwasghaat, icchaakrit bevafaayee, yaa deshadroh shaamil he, jo nijee laabh ke liye kiye jate hai, udhaaharan ke liye, rishwat ke madhyam se kiya jane vaala paap

 Such misdeeds can be ingrained in the sale of religion where one takes advantage of the church by offering the temptation of the real underlying goods
 acedia kisi ko jo kuch karnaa yaa dhyaan dena chahie uske prati laaparvaahee yaa niraadar he
 It has been translated as melancholy disinterested, joyless depression
 yah vishaad ke samaan he, haalanki anasakti aacharan athwa vyavhaar kii vyakhya karata he, jabaki vishaad use utpann karne vaali bhaavana ko abhivyakt karata he
 In early Christian thought, the lack of enjoyment is the willful rejection of the enjoyment of goodness created by God; In its protest, apathy has been considered as a spiritual mindset that discourages people from their religious pursuits
 jab thomas akinas ne apni anusuchee ko pratipaadit karne ke liye 'anasakti kii vyakhya kii to kam paapon jaise ki bechaini or asthirataa ke purvaj hone ke kaaran unhone ise dimagi ashaanti kaa hi ek rup sweekaar kiya
 Dante further refined this definition, describing Acidia as a failure in whole-hearted attachment to the Lord, in which the mind and soul merge into one another; According to him, it is a sin of the middle order, classified as love or absence of love
 vishaad asantushti athwa atrupti ke anubhav kaa varnan karata he, jo kisi kii maujuuda sthiti ke prati dukh kaa kaaran banataa he, khaskar niraashaa ke vichaaron main apane aap ko vyakt kar
 chunki paap kaa aatanrik pratifalan dukh he isliye paap ko kabhi-kabhi udaseenta se bhi sandarbhit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Since apathy often results in melancholia, the revision of Pope Gregory's list has included Despair in detachment
 dhire-dhire niraashaa ke parinaamon par hi na ki kaarnon par baat aakar kendrit ho gai or isiilie 17veen sadi tak aate-aate, vastav main ghaatak paap ko kisi kii pratimaa athwa uphaaron ko vyavhaar main na laa paane kii asafalataa ke rup main mana jane laga
 aacharan athwa vyavhaar main, akedia kii tulana main yah sloth ke kareeb mana jane laga
 yahaan tak ki dante ke samay main bhi aise parivartanon ke lakshan dikh rahe the; kyonki unhone apni purgatorio main vishaad ke anutaap swaroop lagaataar tej raftaar main daudte jane ke rup main chitrit kiya hai
 The modern approach further considers laziness and apathy as a sin in terms of the interior of the subject matter
 chunki iskaa icchaakrit asafalataa ke saath adhik virodhabhas he, udaahranarth prabhu or unke kaaryon se prem karo, susti ko kabhi-kabhi anya paapon kii tulana main kam sangeen samajha jaataa he, aacharan kii tulana main anacharan kaa paap adhik mana jaataa he
 Rath is also considered as rage or "outrage" which can also be considered as uncontrolled stimulation of hatred and anger
 ye uttejnaayen satya kii ek duusare ko ] or vidhi vyavastha ke prati ashishnutaa ke rup main prabal rup se nakaarne kii pratirupi hai tathaa nyaayik pranali ke kaaryakramon ke baahar pratishodh talashne kii chaah tathaa aamtaur par dusron ko haani pahunchane kii hameshaa ichha rakhana

 So suicide is considered an introverted expression of extreme tragedy, rage which is the ultimate rejection of the gift of God
 laalach kii hi tarah, irshyaa ko bhi atrupt ichha ke rup vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he; haalanki do mukhya kaarnon se unamem antar hai
 The first reason is that greed is widely associated with material goods, whereas jealousy is more common and usually applies to everyone
 doosraa kaaran he, ve jo irshyaa kaa paap karte hai, ve is baat se kudhate rahete hai ki kisi or ke paas jo kuch he uskaa abhaav unke paas kyon he or ve dusron ko bhi isse vanchit bane rahane dena chaahate hai
 Dante defined it as a desire to let others be deprived of their goods
 " dante kii purgatori main irshyaalu kaa dand, unki ankho kii taar se silaai kar band kar dena he kyonki unhone dusron ko nicha giraakar dekhte hue paap se bhare anand-upbhog kiye hai
 Akinas described jealousy as "being unhappy because of the goods of others"
 lagbhag sabhi soochiyon main ahankaar yaa akkhadpan ko saat ghaatak paapon main moulik tathaa sarvaadhik gambhir sangeen samajha jaataa he or sachmuch yahi charam strot he jisase anya paap ubharate hai
 It is underlined as a desire to look more important or more attractive than others, such people fail to appreciate the good works of others, and have so much attachment to themselves
 Dante's definition was thus, "love with self leads to hatred and contempt for one's neighbor
 " jacob biderman kii madhyakaalin chamatkaarik naatak senodoxs main ahankaar ko sarvaadhik maaraatmak or ghaatak paapon main se ek mana gaya he jisamen oopaadhidhari khyatipraapt doctor ko sidhe narkavaas kaa dand diya jaataa he
 Perhaps a more well-known example is the story of Lucifer, whose ego was the reason for his falling down from heaven and the resulting conversion to Seton
 In Dante's Divine Comedy, the trespassers are forced to walk with stones strapped to the back to induce contempt for them
 venglori beja shekhi he
 Pope Gregory considered it to be a kind of arrogance, which is why Venglory Guman was included in the ego category while making the schedule of sins
 latin shabdaawalee gloria yaa aatmashlakh, haalanki iskaa angreji samanaarthi shabd - glori he - jiskaa vyapak taur par sakaaratmak arth main hi vyavhaar hota rahaa he; aitihaasik taur par, wain kaa mote taur par arth he - futaile arthath vyarth yaa nirarthak, lekin 14veen sadi tak asangat parishuddhi ko darkinar rakhte hue isse shashakt aatmasakti anternihit ho gai jo ab tak barkaraar he
 Due to these religious semantic changes, vanity itself is a rarely used term and is now commonly used in the literal context of self-realization
 roman catholic carch bhi saat sadgunon ko manyata pradaan karata he, saat ghaatak paapon main se prayek kaa vipareetarthi saadrishyata vahan karata he: In 1589, Peter Binsfeld associated every deadly sin with the evil spirit, enticing people to join sins
 ] ke vargeekaran ke anusaar yugalabandi nimna prakaar hai: According to a Jesuit scholar in 2009, greed is usually the most lethal accepted sin committed by men and arrogance by women
 It was unclear whether these differences were due to differing rates of conduct, or whether they were to be counted among the sins, or even confessed due to differences in such attitudes

 In the mid-1820s, the British East India Company acquired this vast area from the Ahom kings through the Yandabu Treaty
 His main objective of making this acquisition was to exploit the natural wealth in the area
 Apart from crude oil, coal and wild products, he also saw great possibilities of tea cultivation here
 The British East India Company started mass production of tea in Assam from the 1830s
 assam main singpho janajati dwaara paaramparik rup se viksit chaay ke ek kism kii kheti kii jane lagi
 In this episode, the name of Chabua came for the first time in 1823 when the British thought of planting a tea plantation here
 In 1823, many poor Indian laborers were forced to work in an unknown place
 These poor laborers did not know which plant they were brought for sowing or planting
 They did not recognize the plants given to them for planting
 They were considering the tea plant as a wild plant and the British were considering it madness to give importance to this plant
 These laborers gave the name of this plant "cha"
 "aunt" means to sow
 It is believed that after mixing these two words i
e
 Cha and Bua, this place got the name of Chabua
 By 1840, tea was cultivated in a large area of chabua
 The Assam Tea Company was established in 1840 and commercial production of tea began in the region

 vinaashak yaa dhvasank - saamudrik / nausainik bhashaa main vinaashak pot teji se chal kar hamalaa karne vaale yuddh poton ko kaha jaataa hai
 They were invented in the early years of the 20th century and since then their place in the naval war has been unmatched
 bahumukhi or vishwasaneey kaaryon kaa daayitv safaltaapurvak vahan karne ke kaaran nausena ke itihaas main iskaa sthaan bejod ho gaya he
 Therefore, its past, present and future are worth studying
 yah nishchit he ki vinaashak kaa avishkaar tarpedo ke kaaran hua
 The torpedoes revolutionized the naval war
 yah pehla avasar tha jab tarpedo se las chota jahaaj vishaal nausena se morcha lekar use nasht kar saktaa tha
 The development of small ships became necessary with this revolutionary invention in the naval ecosystem
 iske do kaaran the : It is for these reasons that the destroyer was invented
 praarambhik dhvasankon main, jinhen "tarpedo naudhvasank' kehete the, keval do tarpedo nalikaay hoti thim
 They used to mount a cannon on the front to attack the enemy's destroyers
 ye jahaaj bahut chote, 200 se 300 ton visthaapan ke, hote the
 In order to increase the impact of the destroyer over time, it was considered necessary to carry more and more torpedoes
 tarpedo naliyon kii sankhya dhire-dhire badhati gai or dwitiya vishwayuddh ke samay tak do mouting par aath nalika ke rahane kaa maanvikaran hua
 As soon as the airplane entered the invasive shells, it was seen that the avalanche cannon on the destroyer was necessary to protect against air attacks
 prarambh main dhwansak par saamaanya mashinagan sthapit kii gai thi, par aisi choti topon main sanhaarshakti nahin hoti thi, at: baad main ubhay prayojan kii top sthapit kii gai
 When the submarine was developed, a further work was done on the destroyer
 vah tha, pandubbiyon kaa pataa lagaana or unka vinaash karnaa
 As a result, destructive submarine weapons were also carried
 isse dhwansak kaa aakaar or vistaar bad janaa swaabhaavik tha
 Before the First World War, where destroyers used to displace only 300 days of tons, today more than 2,000 tons of displacement have started becoming destroyers
 pichhali kuch dashabdiyon main vinaashkon main anek amul sudhaar hue hai, lekin isaki aadharbhoot visheshtao, jaise tej gati or yuddhayaskshmata main antar nahin hua he
 In the absence of high speed, there is less chance of the destroyers escaping when attacking large ships
 samudr main rakshit rahane inaki ascharyajanak kshamta inke suwahi aakaar or abhikalp ke kaaran he
 The weapons which remain in the destroyer can be divided into three categories: 1
 jahaajon par akraman karne ke liye tarpedo, 2
 The weapon for the attack on the submarine, 3
 vayuyan or choti-moti sthal senaaon se ladane ke liye ubhayprayojaneey topein
 As such, destructors are designed to attack large ships with torpedoes, however, in the modern naval war, the importance of torpedoes is gradually decreasing as the chances of a torpedo attack decrease
 kintu aisa nahin kaha ja saktaa ki tarpedo akraman ke din ab lad chale
 Pursuers and returning torpedoes may return the day of the ship's torpedoes
 kuch logon ke kathananusaar pandubbi kaa itnaa vikaas ho chukaa he ki vinaashak dwaara use nasht nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Although this statement is true to some extent, close examination reveals that even today the destroyer is capable of killing the submarine
 pichley mahayuddh main vinaashkon ne 300 pandubbiyaan samudr main dubaa di thim
 Now even remote Lakshwedhi weapons and improved self-contained tips are available, which has greatly increased the potential of destroyers
 drone helicopter or rocket yukt pandubbimaar tarpedo ke kaaran pandubbiyon ko khojkar nasht karne kii kshamta vinaashkon main bahut bad gai he
 It was only natural for sea ships to increase the vulnerability of aircrafts as the crisis of air attacks increased
 kintu radar niyantrit or tatkshan prahaar karanevaali topein bhi paradhvanik aghati vayuyanon se raksha nahin kar saktin
 When a controlled missile is used in place of the cannon, as in the end, the destroyers will prevail as before
 dhwansak jahaji bede ke sarvaadhik vishwasaneey ang hai
 In the last World War, destroyers did all kinds of work
 inhone krithik dalon ko chhipaay, kaphilon ko anurakshit le gaye, praarambhik surveykshan dalon kaa parivahan kiya, jalsthaleey ghat ko chipa rakhaa, yuddh main hataahat logon ko bachaaya or dak vitaran kiya
 Also submerged about 300 submarines
 ye jal ke tal par bahut nikat sthit yupoton se lekar cruzaron, dhwanskon or petrol jalayanon se jujhe
 The future of destroyers seems bright
 bhavishya main ye vaahak krithik sen ke atyaavashyak ang honge
 These will strengthen air defense by substantially increasing the range of the combat operations and controlling the carrier air movement
 tej jahjon ko pandubbi se dhwansak hi bachaa saktaa he
 The best submarines will be unmatched in the hunt to find destroyers armed with weapons
 dhwansak aaj bhi saarth anurakshan kaary main atyadhik upyogi jahaaj siddh hry he
 How the future destroyers will be made can only be hypothesized, but keeping in view the modern inclination, this hypothesis will be very real
 bhavi dhwansak praaia: nishchit rup se newcleey shakti sanchalit hoga, kyonki newcleey shakti hi ekmaatr saadhan hogi, jisase dhwansak kii sahansheeltaa badhaai ja sakati he
 Tolerance of the destroyers will serve an importance in the future, no doubt, as the task force may have to remain at sea for weeks
 dhwansak kii chaal bhi badhanaa aavashyak hoga
 a future destroyer can easily run at a speed of 50 knots
 tarpedo astr-shastron ko kam karnaa aavashyak hoga
 But submarine torpedoes may remain in the destroyer
 inamen rocket laga hoga, tarpedo main lagi lautanevaali sakriy yuktiyaan aisi hongi ki unhen shghrita se nalon main bharaa ja sake
 The cannons will have to be completely removed and replaced with floor-to-floor controlled missiles
 dhwanskon par drone helicopter bhi rahenge
 In summary, the work of destroyers with the latest types of submarine weapons, sophisticated search devices and controlled missile batteries will be very important in future warfare

 The preserved remains of ancient living organisms that were once alive on Earth or the impressions left by them in rocks, which are found safe in the earth's surfaces or layers of rocks, are called fossils
 jeevashm se carbonic vikaas kaa pratyaksh pramaan miltaa he
 Their study is called paleontology or paleontology
 vibhinn prakaar ke jeevashmon ke nirikshan se pataa chalata he ki prithvi par alag-alag kaalon main bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke jantu hue hai
 The oldest fossil deposits contain only the remains of the simplest organisms, but in innovative deposits the remains of progressively more complex organisms are found
 jyon-jyon ham pracheen se nutan kaalon kaa adhyayan karte hai, jeevashm jivit sajivon se bahut adhik milte-julate prathit hote hai
 Organisms with many intermediate traits suggest that organisms with simple structure have evolved from simple organisms
 adhikansh jeevashm abhilekhapurna nahin he parantu ghoda, oont, hathi, manushya aadi ke jeevashmon kii lagbhag puri shrinkhalaaon kaa pataa lagaaya ja chukaa he jisase carbonic vikaas ke thos pramaan praapt hote hai
 The fossil is called Fossil in English
 is shabd kii utpatti latin shabd "fossilas" se he, jiskaa arth "khodakar praapt kii gai vastu" hota he
 Common: The term fossil refers to the bio-remains of the geological ages of the past which are found in the sedimentary rocks of the earth's crust
 ye jeevashm yah batalaate hai ki ve jaev udgam ke hai tathaa apane main jaivik pramaan rakhte hai
 Two things are required to become fossils of animals and plants
 pehali aavashyak baat yah he ki unamem kankal, athwa kisi prakaar ke kathor ang, kaa hona ati aavashyak he, jo jeevashm ke rup main shailon main parirakshit rah saken
 The fossils cannot remain preserved in fossil condition due to the disintegration of organisms very quickly
 bhoumikeey yugon main prithvi par aise anek jeevon ke samudaay rahete the jinke sharir main koi kathor ang athwa kankal nahin tha at: fossil vigyaani aise jeevon ke samoohon ke adhyayan se vanchit rah jate hai, kyonki unka koi ang jeevashm swaroop parirakshit nahin paaya jaataa, jiskaa adhyayan kiya ja sake
 Therefore, the field of paleontology is limited to those classes of animals and plants that were eligible to become fossils
 duusari aavashyak baat yah he ki kankalon athwa kathor angon ko kshay or vighatan se bachane ke liye avsaadon se tunrat dhak janaa chahie
 The possibility of permanent grazing of the living organisms is very rare, as there are very few places at the site where depressions accumulate in large quantities continuously
 bahut hi kam paristhitiyon main thalwasi jeevon ke kathor bhaag baaloogiri ke baaluu main dabane se athwa bhuskhalan main dabane ke kaaran parirakshit paae gaye hon
 The possibility of aquatic fauna is highly favorable because water is much more than the sedimentation site itself
 in jaleey avsaadon main bhi, aise jaleey avsaadon main jinka nirmaan samudr ke garbh main hota he, bahut badi sankhya main jeev avshesh paae jate hai, kyonki samudr hi aisa sthal he jahaan par avsaadan sabase adhik maatra main satat hota rahata he
 There is a great difference in the shape and composition of the different classes of organisms and the hard parts of plants
 kiton tathaa hydra virgon main kathor bhaag aise padaarth ke hote hai jise kytin kehete hai, anek spanj or diatem baaluu ke bane hote hai, kasheruki kii asthiyon main mukhyat: calcium carbonate or phosphate hote hai, pravaalon, ekinodermata, molska or anek anya praaniyon main tathaa kuch padpon main calcium carbonate hota he or anya padpon main adhikanshat: kashtha utak hote hai
 Among all these substances, chitin can be dissolved with great difficulty
 baaluu, jab use praani utsarjint karte hai, tab bada sheeghra ghul jaataa he
 This is why the skeletons made of sand dissolve very quickly
 calciumi kankalon main chooney kaa carbonate aise jal main, jisamen carbonic amla hota he, ati sheeghra ghul jaataa he, parantu vileyata kii maatra chooney ke carbonate kii maatra ke anusaar bhinn bhinn hoti he
 Powdery skeletons are made of calcite or aragonite
 inamen se kailcite ke kavach eregonite ke kavchon kii apeksha adhik drudh or tikaoo hote hai
 The armor of most creatures is made of calcite or aragonite
 avsaadee shailon main parirakshit jeevashm nimna prakaar ke hote hai : Whole Shielded Animals - It is rare for fossils of a creature to be obtained without any disruption, but examples of such preserved fossils are fossils of mammoths and rhinoceroses, which have been found frozen in the tundra ice
 praaia: aparivartit dasha main parirakshit paae janevaale kankal - kabhi-kabhi jab shailon main keval kankal hi parirakshit paaya jaataa he tab yah dekha gaya he ki vah apni pehle jaisi, tab kii avasthaa main he jab vah samadhisth hua tha
 The only change is that in the fossil state, organic matter is lost from the skeleton
 carbonikaran - kuch padpon or kuch praaniyon main, jaise graptolite, jinamein kankal kytin kaa bana hota he, mul dravya carbonikrut ho jaataa he
 The organism undergoes decomposition, as a result of which oxygen and nitrogen are lost and carbon remains
 kankalon kaa saanchaa - kabhi-kabhi kankal yaa kavach villin ho jate hai or unke sthaan par unka keval saanchaa rah jaataa he
 This is such that after the armor is covered with depression, the inner part of the shell is also filled with depressant
 iske uparaant carbonic amla mishrit jal, shail main risataa hua us sthaan tak pahunch jaataa he jahaan par kavach gada hua rahata he or use calcium ke bikabonate ke rup main purnat: villin kar detaa he
 As a result, only one mold of the internal and external shape of the armor is seen in place of the armor
 in donon ke bich ke sthaan main mulat: kavach tha or yadi yah sthaan mom se bhar diya jaae to kavach kaa yatharth saanchaa mil jaataa he
 Ashmibhavan - Sometimes in fossils, those organisms that have become fossilized are seen up to microscopic size
 antar keval itnaa hota he ki kankalon kaa mul dravya kisi khanij dwaara pratisthapit ho jaataa he
 This action is called Ashmibhavan
 ashmibhavan kaa ati uttam udhaaharan ashmibhoot kashtha hai jo dekhne main bilkul vaise hi dikhalaai padate hai jaisaa jivit padpon kaa kashtha hota he
 This change happens in such a way that when a particle of adikastha is removed, then a particle of sand or any other mineral comes in its place, due to which the original shape of the wood remains intact
 is vidhi se mul dravya ko hataanevaale mukhya khanij ye hai : calcium kaa carbonate, baaluu, lohmakshik, loh oxide or kabhi kabhi calcium kaa sulphate aadi
 Symbols - Sometimes the footprints of fauna, holes, holes etc
 are found in rocks
 yadhyapi ye jeevajantuon ke kathor angon ke koi bhaag nahin hai or isliye inako fossil nahin kaha ja saktaa, phir bhi ye utane hi mahatv ke samajhe jate hai jitne fossil
 Following are the uses of fossils: shailon ke sahasambandh main jeevashmon kaa upyog - ve jeev jo aaj hamen jeevashm ke rup main milte hai, kisi bhaumkeey yug ke kisi nishchit kaal main avashya hi rahe honge
 Therefore, they are of great importance to us
 wiliam smith or kuvye mahoday ke, jo starit bhoumiki ke janmdata hai, samay se hi yah baat bhalee bhanti vidit he ki avsaadee shailon main paae janevaale jeevashmon or unke bhoumikeey stambh ke sthaan main ek nishchit sambandh he
 It has been well known that the smaller the rocks are, the more different the variety and phytosanitary organisms obtained in them, and the longer they are, the simpler and simpler they will be
 at: shailon kaa stareey sthaan nishchay karne main jeevashmon kaa pramukh sthaan he or ve bade mahatv ke siddh hue hai
 Fossils are not found in the ancient rocks of the Cambrian East
 at: jeevashmon ke abhaav main jeevashmon kii sahaayta se in shailon kaa sahasambandh nahin sthapit kiya jaataa he
 Animals and plants from all parts of the geological column from the Cambrian to the present day have been traced
 at: prithvi ke kisi bhi bhaag main in bhaagon ke sam bhaagon kaa pataa lagaana ab apekshaya saral he
 Fossils suggestive of geography of ancient times - Under geography, the sites of ancient times and the expansion of the sea, the borders, lakes, plains, mountains etc
 of that period are included
 kisi vishesh vaataavaran ke anusaar hi jeev apane ko sthit ke anukool kar lete hai, yah baat jitani sachhee adhanik samay main he utani hi sachhee ateet ke bhoumikeey yugon main bhi thi
 Therefore, with the help of fossils, we can find out at which place there were deltas, mountains, rivers, beaches, shallow or deep seas, because the creatures living in the site, the aquatic creatures and the living creatures in the water, the fresh water organisms, the salt water Are completely different from living beings
 jeevashm purajalvaayu ke suchak - jeevashmon kii sahaayta se bhoumikeey yugon kii jalwaayu ke vishay main bhi kisi seemaa tak anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In this direction, the evidence provided by site plants is of particular importance, as they are mostly extensional to the temperature of the marine organisms and they can be easily separated into different parts according to the climate
 samudri jeevon main kuch kaa vistaran jalwaayu kii dashaon ke anusaar hota he, jaise pravaal, jo garam jalwaayu main rahete hai
 Indicators of fossil biology - Fossils have thrown much light on the theory of biology and it is impossible to trace biology without the help of fossils
 jeevashmon kaa sangrah jeevashmiya tathaa starit shail vigyaan donon kii drushti se kiya jaataa he
 The following points should always be kept in mind while collecting fossils: yadi bhoumikeey rachana kaa alpajivashmiya ho to sab jeevashmon kaa sangrah karnaa chahie, chaahe ve purna hon athwa khandamay
 If fossils are not impossible to remove, then complete fossils should never be discarded
 unhen sugamawa se nikaal lenaa chahie
 Such fragmentary fossils, which have elaborate morphological characteristics, are of more importance than many complete fossils, which lack morphological features
 kabhi bhi kshetra main jeevashmon ko pahchaanane kaa praytn na karnaa chahie
 If the collection of fossils is done from the point of view of layered-rockology, then it is necessary to collect fossils from each composition separately
 yah nishchay karnaa bada mahatvapurn he ki jeevashm kis str se sangrahit kiye gaye hai, kyonki bina yah maaloom kiye jeevashmon kaa sangrah praaia: arthhin sa ho jaataa he
 It can be decided with ease at the time of fossilization
 jeevashmon ke sangrah ke saath saath styleey rachanaaon ke mukhya mukhya or vishisht lakshanon ko bhi likh lenaa chahie
 a light hammer, chisel, small bags and scrap paper are very useful to the paleontologist in the fossil
 yadi bade-bade jeevashmon kii khoj ho, to sabase pehle ritukshrit staron kii ore dhyaan dena chahie
 If fossils do not appear here, there is a possibility of being found in a recently dissolved base
 yadi koi jeevashm kathor shail main laga hua dikhaai pade, to ekaek nikaalane kaa prayaas na karnaa chahie balki uske aasapaas ke sthaan main daraaron kaa pataa laga lenaa chahie
 From these cracks, parts of the rock that contain fossils are easily broken
 is prakaar se jeevashmon ke nikaalte samay is baat kaa sadaiv dhyaan rakhana chaahe ki shail par hathaudaa, jeevashm se jitani dur sambhav ho, chalaanaa chahie
 Doing so reduces the possibility of fossil breakdown and separates the fossil including the shell
 yadi foraminiphera jaise chote jeevashmon kaa sangrah karnaa he, to inkaa ek ek karke sangrah karnaa spashtat: asambhav sa he
 In this case it would be appropriate to collect bound shales, or rock samples only
 is prakaar se laai gai saamagree baad main prayogshaala main sankalan kii jaati he or usko ek hast lens se dekhne par usamen anek laghu jeevashm dikhaai padate hai, jinako chalaniyon kii sahaayta se aadhaar se alag kar sakate hai
 After the collection of fossils in the field, a label should be attached to each fossil, which requires two things to be mentioned: the exact level from which the fossil has been taken and the name of the place from which the fossil is collected
 aisa karne ke uparaant jeevashm ko raddi kaagaj main lapetakar or dore se baandhakar prayogshaala main laana chahie
 The method of extracting fossils from the rock base is a type of art
 is vashay main koi pakke niyam nahin batalaaye ja sakate, kyonki bhinn bhinn prakaar kii samasyaayen saamne aati hai
 By which method and how the fossil can be separated from the stone, an experienced paleontologist understands it by looking at the fossil
 jin shail aadhaaron main jeevashm khachit rahete hai ve mridu mrudaa se lekar saghan shail tak hote hai, jinaki kathorta ispaat ke baraabar ho sakati he
 There is not much difference in the extent of hardness of fossils
 jeevashm nikaalte samay jeevashm vigyaani kaa yah dhyey hota he ki jeevashm ko bina kisi prakaar kshati pahunchaae shail se pruthak kar de
 If the base is milder than the fossil, it can be easily removed with the help of a brush
 yadi jeevashm abaddh chuunaapatthar main khachit paae jate hai, to use bhi ham daant saaf karanevaale brush kii sahaayta se alag kar sakate hai
 If the shell base is chalk in nature, it can be separated with the help of confused brushes in the dental apparatus
 anya avasaron par jab jeevashm bhangur ho or badi dridhtaa ke saath shail ke aadhaar main jude hon tab hathode maar markar jeevashmon kaa alag karnaa kathin hota he
 In such a situation, by heating the stone several times and putting it immediately in water, the separation of fossils from the stone becomes easy
 baaluu or anya chooneydaar shailon sa foraminiphera jaise jeevashmon ke nikaalane main, shail ko pehle tod lete hai or phir usko kai prakaar kii chalaniyon main chaan lete hai
 In this, fossils are separated from the rock part
 jab shail kathor hote hai tab doosraa dhang upyog main laayaa jaataa he
 They break the shell into small pieces and then heat them so much that they dry completely and then put them in cold water in this hot state
 is prakaar se kathor mrudaa keech main apavighatit ho jaati he or phir ant main jeevashmon ko prastar bhaag se dho karke alag kar lete hai
 When the separation of fossils by mechanical methods is not possible, then chemical methods are used
 inamen sabase saralatam rituksharan kii vidhi he, jo bahut si dashaon main bina jeevashmon ko kisi prakaar haani pahunchaae hue shail aadhaar ko apghatt kar detaa he
 This action is accelerated by using very dilute acid
 yahan yah batala dena thik hoga ki amla kaa prayog badi saavdhaanee ke saath karnaa chahie, kyonki adhikansh jeevashmon ke panjar chooneydaar hote hai or unpar amla kaa prabhaav turant hota he
 Generally, caustic potash is the right type of reactant, which can be used without any fear
 iske chote chote kanon ko sukhi avasthaa main us saare shail aadhaar par daal dete hai jise hataanaa hota he
 Since the caustic potash is precipitated in nature
 at: yah aadhaar ke andar pravisht kar jaataa he or usko apaghatit kar detaa he
 It does not harm echinoderma, or molluscs
 brackeopoda main iskaa upyog nahin karnaa chahie, kyonki yah inke paratdaar panjaron main sugamawapurvak pravisht kar jaataa he, jiske kaaran inaki paraten alag ho jaati hai
 Finally, fossils should be washed thoroughly with water
 shell jais shailon main parirakshit graptolite or padap jeevashm kaa pruthakkaran "sthanantaran vidhi" se kiya jaataa he
 Following are the main highlights of this separation: namoonay k vah tal, jisamen jeevashm he, neeche karke canada baalsam kii sahaayta se kaach kii slide main chipka dete hai
 The portion of the shell that can be cut or worn easily can be cut or worn
 shell tal ko bhigo lete hai or phir usko pighale hue mom main dubaa dete hai
 The wax separates easily from the humid floor and does not allow any chemical action on the slab
 shell yukt sampurna jeevashm ko hydrophloric amla ke amlatapak main rakh dete hai
 It throttles the shell without damaging the fossil at all
 dhone ke uparaant padap athwa graptolite jeevashm ko cover glass se dhank dena chahie
 Like the fossils of modern fossils like graptolite and some plants extracted in this way, the passages can be made with the help of microscopes
 kathor jeevashmon ke bhi pariched ghis karke banaae ja sakate hai
 Photographs have to be taken at regular periods while grinding
 is vidhi main sabase bada dosha yah he ki jis jeevashm kaa pareekshan is vidhi se kiya jaataa he vah nasht ho jaataa he
 In addition to the above mentioned methods of separation of fossils, there are some special methods for tracing the brachial part of Brachiopoda
 in vidhiyon se trilobites, amonites or ekinodermiz main sivanarekha kaa anurekhan bhi ati mahatv kaa kaary he
 It can be distinguished by the support of any type of storage
 bhartiya masi is kaary ke liye uttam he

 The word environment is coined with two words
 "pari" jo hamaare chaaron ore he"aavaran" jo hamen chaaron ore se ghere hue he
 The environment is the collective unit of all the physical, chemical and biological factors that affect an organism or ecological population and determine their form, life and life
 saamaanya arthon main yah hamaare jivan ko prabhavit karne vaale sabhi jaivik or ajaivik tatwon, tathyon, prakriyaaon or ghatnaon ke samucchy se nirmit ikai he
 It is spread all around us and every event of our life takes place inside it and we humans also affect this environment with all our actions
 is prakaar ek jeevadharee or uske paryaavaran ke bich anyonyashray sambandh bhi hota he
 From the microbial bacteria to insects, insects, all living organisms and plants come in the biological components of the environment and along with it all the biological activities and processes
 ajaivik sanghatakon main jeevanarahit tatv or unase judi prakriyaayein aati hai, jaise: chattaane, parvat, nadi, hawa or jalwaayu ke tatv ityadi
 Generally, the environment is defined in terms of man, and man is declared as a separate entity and all other things around him as his environment
 kintu yahan yah bhi dhyatavya he ki abhi bhi is dharti par bahut si maanav sabhyataaen hai, jo apane ko paryaavaran se alag nahin maanatin or unki nazar main samast prakruti ek hi ikai he
 Whose man is also a part
 vastutah manushya ko paryaavaran se alag maanane vaale ve hai jo takneekee rup se viksit hai or vigyaan or takanic ke vyapak prayog se apni prakritik dashaon main kaafii badlaav laane main samarth hai
 The environment is divided into two blocks based on human intervention - natural or natural environment and man-made environment
 haalaanki purna rup se prakritik paryaavaran yaa purna roopen maanav nirmit paryaavaran, kahin nahin paae jate
 This division is merely a sign of excess and lack of human intervention in natural processes and conditions
 paristhitiki or paryaavaran bhugol main prakritik paryaavaran shabd kaa prayog paryaavas ke liye bhi hota he
 The activities of the technical human, the extensive tampering with nature to achieve the economic purpose and goals of luxury in life, have destroyed the balance of the natural environment, which has created a crisis on the existence of the natural system or system itself
 is tarah kii samasyaayen paryaavarniya avanayan kehalaati hai
 Environmental problems like pollution, climate change etc
 are motivating humans to rethink about their lifestyle and now there is talk of environmental protection and environmental management
 manushya vaigyanik or takneekee rup se apane dwaara kiye gayi parivartanon se nuksaan ko kitna kam karne main sakasham he, aarthik or rajnatik hiton kii takaraav main paryaavaran par kitna dhyaan diya ja rahaa he or manushyata apane paryaavaran ke prati kitni jaagruk he, yah aaj ke jwalanth prashn hai
 The word environment is derived from the Sanskrit language 'pari' prefix and 'cover' which means a set of things that surround a person or animal
 paristhitiki or bhugol main yah shabd angreji ke environment ke paryaay ke rup main istemaal hota he
 The English word environment itself came to be used much later in the sense of the above ecology and it was used for the general conditions around it in the early stages
 yah francisi bhashaa se udbhoot he jahaan yah "state of being environed" ke arth main prayukt hota tha or iskaa pehla gyaat prayog karlile dwaara german shabd Umgebung ke arth ko francisi main vyakt karne ke liye hua
 Today the environment remains a rather urgent issue but today there is no awareness among people about it
 gramin samaaj ko chhod den to bhi mahanagareey jivan main iske prati khaas utsukata nahin pai jaati
 As a result, environmental protection has become just a government agenda
 jabaki yah puure samaaj se bahut hi ghanishtha sambandh rakhane vaala sawaal he
 Unless there is a natural attachment towards it, environmental protection will remain a distant dream
 paryaavaran kaa sidhaa sambandh prakruti se he
 In our environment, we find a variety of animals, plants and other living and non-living things
 ye sab milakar paryaavaran kii rachana karte hai
 The fundamental principles of the subject and practical subjects related to them are studied in various branches of science, such as physics, chemistry and biology
 parantu aaj kii aavashyaktaa yah he ki paryaavaran ke vistrut adhyayan ke saath-saath isse sambandhit vyaavhaarik gyaan par bal diya jaae
 Modern society should be educated on problems related to the environment on a large scale
 saath hi isse nipatane ke bachaavkaari upayon kii jaankaree bhi aavashyak he
 In today's mechanical era, we are going through such a situation
 pradooshan ek abhishaap ke rup main sampoorn paryaavaran ko nasht karne ke liye hamaare saamne khadaa he
 The whole world is going through a serious challenge
 yadhyapi hamaare paas paryaavaran sambandhi paathya-saamagree kii kami he tathaapi sandarbh saamagree kii kami nahin he
 In fact, there is a need to make the available knowledge related to the environment practical so that the public can easily understand the problem
 aisi visham paristhiti main samaaj ko uske karttavya tathaa daayitv kaa ehsaas hona aavashyak he
 In this way awareness of environment can be created in the society
 vastav main sajiv tathaa nirjeev do sanghatak milakar prakruti kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Air, water and land come in inanimate components, while living beings are made up of the animal world and the plant world
 in sanghatakon ke madhya ek mahatvapurn rishta yah he ki apane jivan-nirvaah ke liye paraspar nirbhar rahete hai
 Although man is the most conscious and sensitive creature in the world of animals, yet he depends on other animals, plants, air, water and land to fulfill his needs
 maanav ke parivesh main paae jane vaale jeev-jantu padap, vaayu, jal tathaa bhoomi paryaavaran kii sanrachana karte he
 Education of the environment through education is a powerful means of multi-faceted development of human life
 iskaa mukhya uddeshy vyakti ke andar shaareerik, maansik, saamaajik, samskruthik tathaa aadhyatmik buddhi evam paripakvata laana he
 Knowledge of natural environment is very important for the purpose of education
 prakritik vaataavaran ke bare main gnanarjan kii parampara bhartiya samskruti main armbh se hi rahi he
 But in today's materialistic era, circumstances are becoming different
 ek ore jahaan vigyaan evam takneekee ke vibhinn kshetron main nae-nae avishkaar ho rahe hai
 On the other hand, the human environment is also being affected at the same speed
 aane vaali peedi ko paryaavaran main ho rahe parivartanon kaa gyaan shiksha ke madhyam se hona aavashyak he
 By acquiring knowledge of the interrelations of environment and education, any person can do many important work in this direction
 paryaavaran kaa vigyaan se gaharaa sambandh he, kintu uski shiksha main kisi prakaar kii vaigyanik pechidgiyaan nahin hai
 Nature and ecological knowledge should be taught to the learners in simple and simple language
 shuru-shuru main yah gyaan satahi taur par maatr parichayatmak dhang se hona chahie
 Later, its technical aspects should be considered
 shiksha ke kshetra main paryaavaran kaa gyaan maanviya suraksha ke liye aavashyak he
 The environment is a unit in its entirety in which the inorganic and biological components are interconnected and encapsulated by various interactions
 isaki yah visheshta ise ek paaritantr kaa rup pradaan karti he kyonki paristhitik tantra yaa paaritantr prithvi ke kisi kshetra main samast jaivik or ajaivik tatwon ke antarsambandhit samucchy ko kehete hai
 Hence environment is also an ecosystem
 prithvi par paimaane ke hisaab se sabase vrihattam paaritantr jaevmandal ko mana jaataa he
 The biosphere is the part of the earth in which organisms are found and it is spread in the lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere
 puure parthiv paryaavaran kii rachana bhi inhen ikaayiyon se hui he, atah in arthon main vaishvik paryaavaran, jaevmandal or parthiv paaritantr ek duusare ke samanaarthi ho jate hai
 It is believed that the current composition of the Earth's atmosphere and the current amount of oxygen in it are not only the reason for life on Earth, but also the result
 prakaash-sanshleshan, jo ek jaivik prakriya he, prithvi ke vayumandal ke gathan ko prabhavit karne vaali mahatvapurn prakriya rahi he
 The ideology associated with this type of contemplation sees the whole earth as a single unit, or living earth
 isi prakaar manushya ke upar paryavaaran ke prabhaav or manushya dwaara paryaavaran par daale gayi prabhaavon kaa adhyayan maanav paristhitiki or maanav bhugol kaa pramukh adhyayan bindu he
 * See also: Pollution and Climate Change zyaadaatar paryaavarniya samasyaayen paryaavarniya avanayan or maanav jansankhya or maanav dwaara sansadhano ke upbhog main vruddhi se judi hai
 Environmental degradation involves all changes in the environment that are undesirable and pose a threat to life and sustainability in a particular region or the entire earth
 atah iske antargat pradooshan, jalwaayu parivartan, jaev vividhta kaa ksharan or anya prakritik aapadaaen ityadi shaamil kii jaati hai
 The rapid growth in population and the changing pattern of human consumption coupled with environmental degradation are the root causes of almost all environmental problems
 sansaadhan newnikaran kaa arth he prakritik sansadhano kaa manushya dwaara apane aarthik laabh hetu itani teji se dohan ki unka prakritik prakriyaaon dwaara punarbharan na ho paae
 In the present perspective, the impact of population pressure, rapid growth rate and consumption pattern of people are also considered responsible for resource degradation
 sansadhano ko do virgon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he - navikarniya sansaadhan or anavikarniya sansaadhan
 Apart from this, some resources are available in such sufficient quantity that they cannot be degraded
 They are called renewable resources like solar energy
 anavikarniya sansadhano kaa teji se dohan unke bhandar ko samaapt kar maanav jivan ke liye kathin paristhitiyaan paidaa kar saktaa he
 The manufacture of reserves of coal, petroleum, or metallic minerals is a long-term phenomenon and the speed at which man is exploiting them will one day cease
 vahiin duusari ore kuch navikarniya sansaadhan bhi manushya dwaara itani teji se prayog main laaye ja rahe hai ki unka prakritik prakriyaaon dwaara punarbharan utani teji se sambhav nahin or is prakaar ve bhi anavikarniya sansaadhan kii shrenee main aa jaayenge
 Pollution or environmental pollution refers to the entry of a substance or energy into the environment if its speed is so fast that it cannot be conserved by normal and natural processes in the form of reflection, quenching, decomposition, recycling, or non-harmful form
 is prakaar pradooshan ke do spasht suchak hai, kisi padaarth yaa urja kaa paryaavaran main pravesh or uskaa prakritik paryaavaran ke prati hanikaarak yaa avaanchit hona
 Such unwanted element is called pollutant or pollutant
 pradooshan kaa vargeekaran pradooshak ke prakaar, strot athwa paaritantr ke jis hisse main uskaa pravesh hota he, ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 For example, the types of air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, etc
 are decided on the basis that contaminants enter this part of the ecosystem
 vahiin duusari ore radiodharmee pradooshan, prakaash pradooshan, dhwani yaa rav pradooshan ityadi prakaar pradooshak ke khud ke prakaar par aadhaarit vargeekaran hai
 === Climate change === We have seen many changes in our life
 Water and air change is one of them

 Can not be grown nor can human life be spent in a season, all the living beings need the weather, we also benefit from climate change, so also loss
 inamen chakravaat, tej tufaan, atyadhik barish, sookhaa aadi shaamil he
 Environmental management does not refer to the management of the environment, but to the modern human society's interaction with the environment and the impact it has on management
 prabandhakon ko prabhavit karne vaale teen pramukh mudde hai raajnneeti, kaarykram or sansaadhan 
 The need for environmental management can be seen from several perspectives

 It has also been called "the most influential English language drama of the twentieth century"

 Waiting for Godot is a description of two days of the lives of both the main characters, where they are both in vain and fruitless waiting for the arrival of a person named Godot
 ve kehete hai ki ve use jaanate hai parantu swayan hi kah jate hai ki yadi vah aayaa to use pahchaan nahin paayengen, isse sabit ho jaataa he ki vah use nahin pahachaanate
 is pratiksha main khud ko vyast rakhane ke liye ve khaanaa, sona, vaad-vivaad karnaa, khel-khelnaa, vyaayaam karnaa, aapas main hat badalanaa or yahan tak ki aatmahatya kaa vichaar karnaa jaise sabhi kaary kar daalate hai arthath aisa kuch bhi kaary jisase us "bhayaavah sannaate ko dur rakhaa ja sake"
 In the beginning of the play, Estragon is unsuccessfully trying to remove the shoe from his foot
 haar kar vah budbudata he "karne ko kuch nahin he"
 is vaakya ko pakadakar vladimir vichaar karne lagata he, maano 'kuch nahin' vastav main koi bada kaary he jise unhen saare naatak ke dauraan karnaa he
 When Estragon succeeds in removing the shoe, he looks inside it, and finds nothing there
 Just before this, Vladimir peeks into his hat
 yah pratimaan saare naatak ke dauraan doharaaya gaya he
 Both main characters speak of remorse during the play, in which they mention the two thieves hanging on the cross with the Lord Jesus
 saath hi yah bhi charchaa karte hai ki chaar main se keval ek evanjalist ne bataaya ki do main se ek chor ko bachaa liya gaya tha
 This discussion was one of many biblical discussions during the play, which are evident in the play
 isse yah abhas hota he ki naatak kaa mul va chipa hua vishay ishwar-milan va nirvana he
 When both the main characters feel Godot is close, they shout with joy, 'we have survived'
 vladimir samay-samay par estrogan kii samvaad akushalta se krodhit hota he
 For example he says "hey Gogo can you send the ball back to me at least once?" With emotion, he is motivating Estragon or Gogo to improve his dialogue black
 gogo saare naatak main samvaad kala main sangharsh karata prathit hota he tathaa vladimir unke aapasi va anya logon, donon ke bich sanvaadon main usase agrani rahata he
 In between, Vladimir loses his temper with Gogo, but most of the time there is an intimacy between them, which is evident in their friendly embrace and support of each other
 estrogan darshak ddeergha kii ore dekhtaa he ore kahata he ki kya berang mahole he
 He wants to get away from there, but is reminded that they are waiting
 haalanki donon paatr is baat par sahamat nahin ho pate ki godot ke milane kaa niyat samay va sthaan aaj or ab hi he
 It is not even clear to them what day it is today
 puure naatak main samay yaa to baadhit he yaa khandit, athwa uskaa astitv hi nahin he
 On the whole occasion, they have full knowledge that they are about to meet near a tree
 vah ped nikat hi vidyaman he
 Estragon falls asleep but Vladimir doesn't pick him up because he doesn't want Gogo to wake up and bore him with his dream account
 Estragon wakes up and wants to listen to an old ridiculous anecdote with a prostitute whom Vladimir begins to narrate but has to take a toilet break in between
 vaapis aane par vah yah kissa madhya main hi tyaag detaa he or estrogan se poochta he ki vah samay vyateet karne ke liye or kya karen
 estrogan prastaav detaa he ki ve suuli par latak sakate hai, parantu yah vichaar yah soch kar tyaag diya jaataa he ki yadi donon main se ek batch gaya to ek kaa jivan ati kshtmay hoga
 ant main donon kuch na karne kaa surakshit maarg chunate hai
 Estragon says "this is the safe way", and asks what he will do when Godot comes
 Vladimir does not even think about this for once, and he is only able to say: "nothing is sure"
 jab estrogan kahata he ki use bhukh lagi he to vladimir use ek gaajar detaa he
 Estragon does not like it much but eats it
 samay vyateet karne kaa yah upaay bhi samaapt ho jaataa he or estrogan kah uthta he hamaare paas karne ko abhi kuch nahin he
 There is a new twist in the wait for both the characters when Pojo and his laden slave Lucky pass through there
 "ek dardpurn rudan " ke saath lucky ke aagaman kii ghoshnaa hoti he
 a rope is tied around his neck
 vah aadhi stage paar kar jaataa he jiske baad doosraa chor pakade pojo najar aata he
 Pozo shouts at his slave Lucky and calls him a "boar", but he is civil to Estragon and Vladimir
 yah donon pehle pojo ko hi godot samaj baithte hai or uske hathi va asabhy vyavhaar kii ore dhyaan nahin dete
 godot samajhe jane par pojo thodaa chidh jaataa he
 He tells them that "everyone has equal rights on the road"
 iske baad pojo chikan va sharaab kaa seven karke vishram kaa vichaar karata he
 When he eats and starts throwing bones, Estragon catches him
 isse vladimir atyant glani kaa anubhav karata he
 Pojo says that these bones are for Lucky and Estragon will have to ask Lucky
 Estragon asks Lucky and Lucky mumbles silently
 ise "naa" maanakar estrogan haddiyaan grahan kar letaa he
 Vladimir tortures Pozo for ruthless behavior towards Lucky, but Pozo ignores him
 Both the main characters ask Lucky that when Pojo is not getting him to do any other work then why does Lucky not put his burden down
 Upon hearing this, Pojo says that Lucky is trying to please him, so that he does not sell it again
 Lucky starts crying after hearing this
 pojo use roomaal thamata he, parantu jab estrogan uske aansu ponchney kii koshish karata he, lucky uske takhnon par chot martha he
 Before leaving, Pojo says what he can give them to entertain him
 estrogan dhan maang letaa he jis par vladimir thodaa krodhit hokar kahata he ki pojo lucky ko thodaa sochane or naach karne kii anumati degaa
 Lucky's dance is complete and chaotic
 vladimir dwaara sir par topi rakhe jane se shuru hui uski "soch-prakriya" keval ek achaanak neend se jaagrit hue vyakti kaa vyarth samvaad he
 Lucky's monologue is initially okay but later becomes completely incomprehensible and can only happen when Vladimir removes his hat from his head
 lucky vaapis das ban jaataa he or aadeshaanusaar saamaan sametane lagata he
 Pozo and Lucky go away
 naatak ke donon bhaagon ke ant main ek ladkaa aata he jo ki godot kaa doot maanya kiya jaataa he
 He says that "godot will come tomorrow, not this evening
" In the conversation, Vladimir asks the boy if he even came yesterday, which shows that both characters have been waiting for Godot since time immemorial and that it will continue for eternity in the future as well
 After the boy leaves, he also thinks of leaving but does not make any effort towards it
 This happens at the end of both parts, the curtain falls
 duusare bhaag kaa aarambh vladimir ke dwaara geet gunagunaane se hota he jo ki ek kute se sambandhit he or jisase naatak ke uddeshy kaa vyapak gyaan hota he
 This song also shows that the play has an atmosphere of traditional music, entertainment and festivities
 is naatak main kukkur jati se sambandhit sandarbhon evam udaahranon main se keval ek he
 This also shows that Vladimir is aware of the fact that the world he is entangled in is festive
 He begins to explain that although there is some evidence of definite homogenous development in his world, he is basically repeating the days of personal life and the fact
 vladimir ke geet ke vishay main ujin web ne likhaa he: "geet kaa kaal samroop se gatisheel to nahin he, parantu vah us antaheen sthiti ke prati sankethik he jiskaa ekmaatr shaashvat ant hai: mrityu"
 Estragon once again states that he spent the night in a ditch and was beaten by "10 people" - albeit with no bruises
 vladimir usko vriksh main ho rahe mausami badlaavon ke bare main bataata he or pichley din kii gatividhiyon ke vishay main bhi, parantu estrogan ko kuch adhik yaad nahin aata
 vladimir pojo or lucky kaa naam letaa he parantu estrogan ko keval haddiyaan or takhne kaa dard hi yaad aata he
 Vladimir realizes that if Estragon shows his leg, he can remember it
 badi mushkil se estrogan taang dikhaata he jis par ghaav ab gaharaa ho chalaa he
 Vladimir realizes that Estragon is not wearing any shoes
 gaajar to samaapt ho chali he so vladimir estrogan ko shaljam tathaa muuli kaa chunaav karne ko kahata he
 Estragon chooses radish but returns due to being black
 phir estrogan sone kaa prayaas karata he thik pichley din vaali bhrun ke samakaksh avasthaa main
 vladimir use lori sunaata he
 Vladimir sees a Lucky Wali hat and thinks of wearing it
 isse ek hat parivartan prakriya shuru ho jaati he
 They try to follow Pojo and Lucky, but Estragon doesn't remember whether he met Pozo and Lucky or not
 He simply obeys Vladimir's orders
 ve donon ek duusare ko gaaliyaan dete hai or phir sulah bhi kar lete hai
 After that they try to do some physical tremors and a yogasana, but both fail
 pojo or lucky kaa aagaman phir hota he
 Pozo is blinded and says that Lucky is dumb
 rassi ab kaaphi choti ho gai he or pojo kii bajaay ab lucky agrani maardarshak bhoomika main he
 Pozo has lost his sense of time and says that he does not remember that he met Estragon and Vladimir the previous day
 vah yah bhi kahata he ki aaj kii gatividhiyaan bhi use kal yaad nahin rahengi
 At one time, all of them fall on top of each other
 estrogan sochataa he ki or khaanaa nikalwane yaa lucky dwaara maare jane kaa badla lene kaa yahi mauka he
 There is a long discussion on this
 pojo unako dhan dene kii peshkash karata he parantu vladimir sochataa he ki un donon ke rahane se man bahala rahata he or ve donon bhi godot kii lambii pratiksha main saath dene main majaboor ho jate hai
 In the end, however, everyone stands up
 bhaag 1 main pojo ek dambhi vyakti tha parantu ab andhepan ke baad vah thodaa paripakv ho gaya he
 After he leaves, Vladimir interprets his last words: "the place of birth is also near a crematorium, there is a moment of light and then it becomes night"
 lucky or pojo chale jate hai
 The same boy comes again and repeats today, do not wait for Godot, but tomorrow he will definitely come
 In desperation, both of them attempt suicide by hanging from Estragon's belt, but they break with the weight of both
 estrogan kii paint gir jaati he parantu use tab tak pataa nahin chalata jab tak vladimir use nahin bataata
 ve nirnay karte hai ki ve kal majboot rassi laayenge or punah aatmahatya kaa prayaas karenge, yadi godot nahin aata
 They decide to leave again but do not make any effort of it
 baket ne naatak kii dhara ke alaava charitron ke vishay main kuch vishesh prakaash nahin daalaa he
 Beckett had said that once Sir Ralph Richardson had asked for detailed information about Pozo, Vladimir and other characters in his most influential manner
 tab unhone sirf itnaa kaha tha
 


 that only those who have written about them know in the play
 "adhik jaananaa hota to pehle hi naatak main likh detaa or yah baat sabhi paatro par lagu he
 " jab baket ne naatak likhnaa shuru kiya tab uske mastishk main vladimir va estrogan kii koi chhavi nahin thi
 Nor has he told or shown them anywhere
 roger blin ne bataaya: "baket unki awaajen sunata tha, magar apane paatro ko vivaranit nahin kar paata tha
 He used to say]: 'the only thing i know is that both the main characters are ballers
 "' "bowler hat baket ke grih nagar foxrock main purushon kaa ek prachlit paridhaan tha
 As a child, his mother used to make him wear a beret and inspire him to wear a bowler hat, which was also worn by Beckett's father
 " Nothing has been written about the physical structure of both characters; Although it appears that Vladimir was heavier in both
 bowler hat va anya haasyaaspad pahaluon ke kaaran aadhunik darshak unki tulana laurel va hardi kaa prabhaav saafe ho jaataa he
 In an article titled 'the Comic Mind: Comedy and the Movies', Gerold Mast wrote about 'using the new format to show the truth indirectly'
 Beckett later made special comments on Laurel and Hardy in his 1953 novel Watt
 In that novel, Beckett addressed a healthy bush as 'a hardy laurel' or 'a strong laurel'
 vladimir lagbhag saare naatak main khadaa rahata he jab ki estrogan aksar baith jaataa he va so bhi jaataa he
 "estragon is calm while Vladimir is restless
" Vladimir looks at the sky and thinks about religious and philosophical subjects
 udhar estrogan saadhaaran purushon kii tarah rosemara kii baton main ulajhaa rahata he
 He is not able to go higher than things like eating and relieving pain
 He is also a bit forgetful but he also remembers being reminded of Vladimir
 udhaaharan ke liye vladimir ne usase poocha "kya tumhen gospel yaad he?" is par estrogan kahata he use us pavitra sthaan ke rangeen naqshe yaad he or vah apana mrit sagar par apana honeymoon manane vaala tha
 In fact his short-term memory was weak and he was probably suffering from Alzheimer's
 udhar al alvarez likhata hai: "shaayad yahi bhulakkadpan donon kii dosti bane rahane main sahaayak hua
 Estragon forgets, reminds Vladimir and thus lapse time
 ye donon pachaas saal se saath hai parantu pojo ke poochne par unhone apni aayu bataane se inkaar kar diya
 There are many problems in Vladimir's life too, but he is tough in both
 "vladimir kaa dard haalanki maansik he
 That is why he also changes his hat from Lucky because he wants to discuss with others
 " During the entire play, the two address each other as "DD" and "gogo", although a boy also called Vladimir as "mr
 Albert"
 Beckett initially chose the name Levi for Estragon, but when Pozo asks, he calls his name "mágragor Adre"
 saath hi vah french naam "katule " yaa "katulas" bhi bulaayaa jaataa rahaa, khaskar pehle "fabar sanskaran" main
 america sanskaran main yah "adam" ban gaya
 Beckett only said that they were "bored with cutaneous"
 vivian marsar naamak ek aalochak ne kaha ki vatting for godot naatak ne ek asambhav lagane vaali baat ko sambhav karne kaa kirtiman sthapit kiya he
 a play in which nothing happens, but the audience still concentrates and watch it
 yahi nahin, isamen doosraa bhaag pehle bhaag kaa hi thodaa bhinn rup he, atah baket ne yah ajooba likh daalaa he jahaan do baar kuch nahin hota
" - akhbaar ne apane is sanskaran main donon mukhya paatro kii bhashaa par sawaal uthaaye the or likhaa tha ki "shaayad baket ne kataaksh kiya, aap kaise kah sakate hai ki ve pi
ech
di
 nahin hai? 'tum kaise jaanate ho ki unhone pi
ech
di
 nahin kiya hai?' unka jawaab tha " unka ateet acha rahaa hoga, haalanki keval itnaa gyaat he, ve ek baar effil tower gaye the, va ek baar rise nadi ke kinare angoor todane
 pehle natya manchan, jis par baket ne swany najar rakhi thi, main donon mukhya paatro ke vastra gande to nahin, magar thode saadhaaran he
 On the other hand, Vladimir flares up a little when Estragon asks for bags and bones, so that it is known that he had a feeling of behavior
 " Although Beckett did not write anything about the background of the characters, the actors working in the play have found their inspiration
 jin martin kii ek doctor mitra marthe gotier, salpetrire aspataal main kaam karti thi tathaa martin ne usase poocha: "'suno, marthr, is naatak main ek khaas tarah kii aawaaj kaa zikr he uskaa vivaran or vyakhya kahan mil sakati he?' bataaya: is bimaari main marij ke haath, pair kaanpane lagate he or dhire-dhire vah kaanpe bina bol bhi nahin paata
 maine tab kaha mujhe yahi chahie
 baket va raajar thode kam aashwast the magar phir bhi taiyaar ho gaye
 "when Martin told Beckett that he would play Lucky's character like a Parkinson's patient, Beckett said" of course
 "beckett also mentioned that Marco had the same disease
 parantu phir atisheeghra hi vishay badal diya
" When Beckett was asked why Lucky was named so, he said that he was "lucky that he has no aspirations"
 kuch aakalnon main yahan tak bhi kaha gaya ki kyonki "didi or gogo kaa rishta purnataya vivaranit yaa sthapit nahin tha", lucky va pojo unheen kaa ek praaroop hai
 Pozo's dominance in Pozo and Lucky's relationship was virtually meaningless
 dhyaan se dekhne par gyaat hota he ki lucky kaa prabhaav sadaa hi adhik tha
 He danced and even thought of removing Pozo's emptiness
 isliye pratham baar se hi pojo hi asal main lucky kaa gulam tha
 Pozo also acknowledges that Lucky has given him culture, humility and reasoning
 usamen vakrapatutaa swaabhaavik rup se aa gai
 Pozo's party account is a good example: when his memory goes away, he also loses this rhetoric
 pojo ke vishay main keval itnaa gyaat hua he ki vah apane das lucky ko bechney meley main ja rahaa tha
 He considers himself a high-ranking landlord when he is only an arrogant and selfish person who behaves rudely to others
 uskaa pipe dublin kii sabase mashhoor tambaakoo company cap and petersan kaa bana he, 
 pojo apni pipe ko "brir" kahata tha jabaki estrogan use "dudin" or isi se donon ke saamaajik va aarthik antar kaa pataa chalata tha
 Pozo considered his memory somewhat weak, but it was because he was self-sufficient
 baket ke shabdon main "pojo asurakshit maansikta se grast tha
 That is why he used to debate in every subject and used to behave the same in every task
 pojo lucky ko ek lambii rassi se niyantrit karata tha or lucky ke tanik bhi dhire hone par rassi ko jor jor se jatke detaa tha
 Lucky was completely in his possession and played his sack "like a loyal dog"
 " peeth par baari boj uthaane main vah nahin hichkichaata tha
 Lucky only speaks once in the entire play, that too when Pozo asks him to think for Vladimir and Estragon
 pojo or lucky saath saalon se saath hai or is antaraal main unka rishta kaaphi bighad gaya he
 Lucky was always wise with Pojo, but with age he became a hater
 uski "soch-prakriya" uski buddhi tathaa uskaa ghatiya "naach" vriddhavastha kaa krur parichaayak he
 Lucky always remained loyal to Pozo despite his cruel behavior
 In the second part also when Pozo suddenly becomes blind, Lucky does not leave him and becomes a guide
 unka rishta maan ek rassi ke jod se kahin badhkar he thik jaise didi or gogo "godot ke kaalpanik" madhyam se jude hai
 This is what Beckett said to American director Alan Schneider: "an actor has to be a psychopath and the actor has to embody a bit of insanity to play his character
" "naatak ke anuwaad main


 baket ke sabhi french chizon ko nihit karne kaa satat prayaas kiya or sabhi angreji naamon va sthanon ko lucky se jod diya
 baket kaa maananaa tha ki lucky naam kaa angreji se gahan naata he
 " paatro main keval ek ladke kaa zikr he
 In the first part a local boy reassures Vladimir that he is seeing DD for the first time and that he did not come yesterday
 vah bataata he ki vah mistar godot ke liye bakriyaan charaata he
 It also states that his brother, whom Godot beats heavily, grazes sheep
 haalanki godot donon ko bhojan pradaan karata he va apane charaagaah main rahane kii anumati bhi detaa he
 In part two, the boy assures Vladimir that the person who arrived the previous day was not him, this is his first arrival
 jab vladimir usase poochta he ki godot kya karata he to ladkaa kahata he, "mahashay, kuch nahin
" ladkaa yah bhi kahata he ki shaayad godot kii safed dadhi he
 There is also mention of a sick brother of a boy in the talks, but it is not clear whether this brother is part one boy or some other
 godot kii pahchaan par anekon vaad vivaad hue hai
 "when Colin Duckworth asked Beckett directly whether Pozo was Godot, Beckett replied: 'no
 It seems but it is untrue
 "' "when Roger Blinn asked what the character of Godot is synonymous with, Beckett said it originated with Godillo, the Godse, the French abusive word for shoes, because feet have an important place in the play
 baket adhiktar godot ke vishay main yahi vyakhya karte the
 " "ek baar baket ne peter woodthorp se kaha ki ve paatr ko godot naam dene par ab thodaa pachhataa rahen hai kyonki bahut se darshakon ne ise god athwa bhagwaan se jod kar anekon bhrantiyaan utpann kar di he
 "I told Richardson that if i meant God, i would not have named God, Godot
 That has disappointed Richardson
" But Beckett also once admitted, "if i say i am not aware of the meaning of the word Godot, then it seems an insincere thing
" main bhalee bhaanti jaanata hoon ki anek log ise 'god' yaa ishwar kaa hi rup maanate hai
 But remember that i wrote this play in French, and even if this thought was somewhere in my subconsciousness, i never came across it directly
 " yah ek mjedaar kathan tha kyonki baket ne kai baar kaha tha ki upchetana man se likhte hai yahan tak ki likhte hue ek samadhi jaisi avasthaa main chale jate hai
 Like Beckett's other works, the play has no bicycle, but Hay Kenner, in his essay "the Cartesian Center," wrote that Beckett once said on the subject of Godot that Godot is a veteran cyclist and a bald and perpetual man
 is
 saath hi vah rashtriya va nagar kii pratispardhaon main aksar ek adhikari ke rup main najar aata he
 His maiden name is unknown but the surname is Godieu which is pronounced Godot
 haalanki yah naatak trek cycle res ke vishay main nahin he parantu baket french cyclist raajar godot ke prashansak the tathaa rubex ke velodrome main baahar uski pratiksha kar chuke the
 Only one of the two boys survived the beating, ”beckett also jokingly says, leaving one leg of Estragon
 " In Britain and Ireland, the pronunciation of the word Godot emphasizes the first syllable, / ˈɡɒdoʊ / ; While in North America on another syllable, / ɡəˈdoʊ / 
 Beckett, however, considered the English pronunciation to be correct
 isamen tii mook he
 Born in Ireland, Beckett had a good knowledge of the Irish language
 irish gaulik main, "go dio" ke do arth hai "sadaa ke liye" or "lambey samay ke liye"
 likhte samay shaayad baket ne is shabd kaa prayog kinchit vyangyatmak kone se kiya he kyonki vah jaanate the ki angrej or french darshak shaayad hi un shadjaal ko samaj paayenge
 Both acts have only one scene
 do aadmi ek deshi sadak par ek ped ke paas intjaar kar rahe hai
 The men are of unspecified origin, although it is clear that they are not English in terms of nationality
 According to the script, Estragon sits on a low mound but in practical terms - like Beckett's 1975 German film - it is generally a stone
 pehle ank main ped khaali he
 In the second issue, some leaves appear while according to the script it is the next day
 dimag ke liye bahut kam vivaran uplabdh hote hai "liyu veg kaa vichaar jo ek aisa sthaan he jiskaa vistrut vivaran nahin diya janaa chahie"
 Alan Schneider once suggested putting the play in a whirlwind - Pozo is often referred to as a ringmaster - but Beckett consulted opposite to him: "from the point of view of his ignorance i agree with this cycle Am not and i think Godot needs a very closed box
 " unhone ek baar "manch ke farsh kii salaakhon kii dhoomil chaaya" kii bhi apeksha kii thi lekin ant main unhone is "prakatikaran" ke khilaaf faisla kiya
 DD and Gogo appear to bounce several times in their 1975 Schiller Theater production, to some extent in James Knowlson's description "like birds trapped in the ropes of the net"
 didi or gogo keval isliye funs jate hai kyonki ve abhi bhi is avadharana se chipte hue hai ki aazaadee sambhav he; aazaadee kaid kii tarah dimag kii ek avasthaa he
 According to Beckett, one of the sources of inspiration for this play was a painting by Caspar David Frederick
 baket ke saath 1824 kii main and vuman contemplatting da moon naamak painting ko dekhakar rubi kohan yaadon main kho jaati hai jinhone "spasht rup se ghoshnaa karte hue kaha, 'aapako maaloom he, yahi vatting for godot kaa strot tha
 "" He may have been confused about the two paintings because on other occasions he drew the attention of friends to Two Men Contemplating the Moon of 1819, in which two men wearing a cloak were looking at a full moon It was surrounded by black branches of large and leafless trees
 " donon maamle main painting kaaphi had tak ek jaisi thi isliye unka sakshyankan donon par ek samaan lagu ho sakati he
 However, some sources consider the conversation between Suzanne deschevaux-dumesnil and Beckett in Rusillon to be the inspiration of this work
 baket ne jeri tolmar dwaara liye gaye ek neuyork post saakshaatkaar main is baat ko sweekaar kiya
 Ruby Cohan describes Beckett's play writing as "an escape of the increasingly autocratic interiority of the fictional trilogy" - for which she references Beckett's Molloy, Malone Dyes, and The Unnamable; Beckett has claimed that he "began writing Godot as a sabbatical to get away from the terrible prose he was writing at the time
" " "since it is so nude, so original, that it invites every kind of social and political and religious interpretation," Normand Berling wrote in a tribute to an autumn 1999 play, "with which Beckett himself was referred to various sects Was associated with ideas, various movements and ideologies
 unki spasht vyakhya karne ke liye kiye gaye prayaas safal nahin hue hai lekin aisa karne kii ichha swaabhaavik he jab unka saamana kisi lekhak se hota he jinaki alpavaadi kala moolbhoot vaastaviktaa tak pahunchati he
 The ‘less’ compels us to search for ‘more’ and the need to talk about Godot and Beckett has resulted in an ever-increasing burden of books and articles
 " Throughout the Waiting for Godot the reader or viewer may encounter religious, philosophical, traditional, psychoanalytic and life-related - especially wartime - references
 kuch aise anusthanaatmak pahalu or tatv hai jinhen sidhe wadevil se liya gaya he or ve jaise hai unase adhik banane main khatra he: arthath keval sanrachanaatmak suvidhaayen, avatar jinamein lekhak apane kaalpanik paatro ko sthapit karata he
 The play has "used many typical forms and situations, all of which encapsulate themselves in both humor and compassion
" " baket film ke aarambhik nots main is tathy ko acchhee tarah se spasht karte hai: "uparokt tathy se kisi bhi sachai kaa koi lenadena nahin he jise keval sanrachanaatmak or naatakeey suvidha kaa naam diya gaya he
 "he made another critical comment on Lawrence Harvey, stating that" his work does not depend on experience - there is no record of experience
 beshak aap iskaa istemaal karte hai"
 Beckett immediately grew tired of the "infinite misconception"
 bahut pehle 1955 main unhone tippanee kii thi ki "mujhe samaj main nahin aata he ki log ek choti si baat ko itnaa bada kyon bana dete hai
 "he was expecting nothing more than clueless clues, though:" Peter Woodthrop one day asked him in a taxi what the play was about: "it's symbiotic, Peter; it's symbiotic," Beckett replied
 baket ne 1975 main shiller theatre ke liye naatak kaa nirdesan kiya
 Although he supervised several productions, this was the first time that he had complete control this time
 walter esmus unke eemaandaar yuva sahaayak nirdeshak the
 This production or presentation was not natural
 baket ne samajhaayaa, It is a game, everything is a game
 jab unamem se chaaron jameen par lete hue hon tab use prakritik dhang se sambhala nahin ja saktaa
 use kritrim rup se, ballat kii tarah karnaa padataa he
 Otherwise everything becomes a copy, a copy of reality
 It should be clear and transparent, not dry
 It is a game played for survival
 " Over the years, Beckett has clearly realized that to a large extent Godot's success was related to the fact that it was open to a wide variety of reading and was not necessarily a bad thing
 baket ne khud " godot ke sabase prasiddh mishrit jati vaali prastutiyon main se ek kii sweekruti di thi jise uniwarsity of kep toun ke baxtor theatre main pradarshit kiya tha jiskaa nirdesan donald hovaarth ne kiya tha jisamen do kaale abhinaytaon jon kani or winston natshona ne didi or gogo kii bhoomika nibhaai thi; pojo or lucky kii bhoomika do gore abhinaytaon bill flin or peter picholo ne nibhaai thi 
 baxtor production ko aksar ek spasht raajnneetik prastuti ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya he jabaki vastav main is par bahut kam jor diya gaya tha
 Although the reaction was shown that the play cannot be taken as a political metaphor in any way, it still contains elements that are relevant to any local situation in which one person is exploited or tortured by another person being done
 " "it was seen as a metaphor for the Cold War" or French resistance to the Germans
 graahak haisel likhte hai ki, "aisa lagata he ki pojo or lucky kaa pravesh mukhyabhumi britain ke ireland ke nazariye ke ek roopak se adhik kuch nahin he jahaan samaaj ab tak ek laalchee sattarudh abhijaat varg dwaara abhishpt he jabaki majdoor varg ko niskriy or har baat se anibhigya rakhaa gaya he
 " film pariyojna par baket kii tarah jodi ko aksar irish uccharan ke saath pradarshit kiya gaya he
 Some feel that this is an inevitable result of Beckett's rhythm and vocabulary but is not specified in the text
 kisi bhi haal main ve angreji bhandar kaa hissaa nahin hai: naatak main ek jagah estrogan "shant" shabd kaa angreji uccharan kaa majaak udaata he or veshyalay main angrej kii kahani" kaa anand letaa he
 "bernard Ducor DD develops a trilogy of theories in Gogo and the Absent Godot based on the use of trinity psychology descriptions and onomastic techniques in Sigmund Freud's The Ego and the Id
" deukor abhaav ke aadhaar par paatro ko paribhaashit karte hai" tarksangat go-go adhure ahankaar ko moort rup pradaan karata he, laapata khushi kaa siddhant: go- go
 di-di - jo adhik sahaj prakruti kaa or tarkahin he - ko tarksangat siddhant ke pichde id yaa todphod ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Godot fulfills the function of the Maha-ego or moral standards
 pojo or lucky mukhya paatro ke punrariti maatr hai
 Ducor finally sees Beckett's play as a metaphor for the futility of man's existence when liberation from an outside entity is expected and denied by introspection of itself
 "aatma ke chaar pahaluon yaa chaar theth vyaktitvon ko do jodiyon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he: ahankaar or chaaya, vyaktitv or aatma kii chhavi 
 chaaya vah paatr he jisamen ahankaar ke tale dabi hamaari sabhi tuchh bhavanaaen shaamil hoti hai
 Lucky serves as the polar antonym of the shadow autocratic Pozo, the prototype of rich normalcy, who progressively controls and taunts his subordinate, thus symbolizing the oppression of unconscious shadows from autocratic arrogance
 pehle ank main lucky kaa ekalaap damit achetna kii ek dhara kii ek misaal ke rup main dikhaai detaa he kyonki use apane maalik ke liye "sochane" kii anumati he
 Apart from the aromatic herb tarragon, the name estragon has another meaning: "estragon" is a homogeneous form of the female hormone estrogen
 This leads us to identify the female image of the anima, the soul of Vladimir
 yah estrogan kii kavy pravriti, uski samvedansheeltaa or sapanom, uske tarkahin mizaaj ke bare main bataata he
 Vladimir appears as a complementary Mardana theory or perhaps as a contemplative type of rational personality
 vyapak taur par kaha jaataa he ki astitvvaadiyon ke vichaar se kuch aise moulik prashn hai jiskaa prayek manushya se saamana hota he agar ve apane vyaktiparak astitv ko gambhirtha se lete hai
 Those questions include questions like death, the meaning of human existence and the place of God in that existence
 kaaphi had tak astitvvaad ke siddhant is baat par jor dete hai ki sachetan vaastaviktaa bahut jatil hoti he or isamen koi "uddeshy" yaa saarvbhaumik drushti se gyaat mulya kaa abhaav hota he: vyakti ko ise sweekaar karke or chhodkar, na ki bas iske bare main baat karke yaa man main isaki kalpana karke, mulya kaa nirmaan karnaa chahie
 yahan is naatak ko in sabhi muddon ko sparsh karata hue dekha ja saktaa he
 Most of Beckett's works, including Godot's, are considered by philosophers and literary scholars to be part of the Theater of the Absurd movement, a form of theater that originated from the libertarian philosophy of Albert Camus
 nirarthakwaad khud astitvvaad ke paaramparik kathanon kii ek shakha he jiske agradoot sorain kircguard the or jo yah maanata he ki brahmand main nihit arth ke acchhee tarah se maujuud hone ke baavjood maanav jati maansik yaa darshanik seemaa ke kisi rup kii vajah se iskaa pataa lagane main aksham he
 Thus humanity is cursed to face the absolute futility of existence in the absence of the Absurd or inner purpose
 thik didi or gogo ke vishesh rup se swaarthee or kathor hone ke baad ladkaa yah bataane aata he ki godot nahin aa rahaa he
 The boy can be seen representing humility and hope followed by a rising personality and character deliberately abandoning his sense of mercy and in this case the young Pozo and Lucky may be involved
 is prakaar godot main dayaa kaa bhav he or vah apane vaade ke anusaar prati din pahunchane main vifal ho jaataa he
 No one cares that a boy has been beaten
 is vyakhya main vidmbana yah he ki keval unke dilon ko dayavan banaakar hi ped ke paas intjaar kar rahe paatr aage bad sakate hai or godot kaa intjaar karnaa band kar sakate hai
 a lot can be read in Beckett's inclusion of the story of the two thieves in Luke 23: 39–43, and then discusses regrets
 ekant ped ko chrishchiyan cross ke pratinidhi ke rup main yaa vastav main jivan vriksh ke rup main dekhnaa aasaan he
 Similarly, since the boy describes God as a white-bearded god and if the boy's proof is to be believed, Godot's beard is also white, leading many to see God and Godot as one and the same
 Huh
 vladimir ke "messiah ne ham par dayaa dikhaai he!" ko is baat kaa saboot mana ja saktaa he ki yah kam se kam vahi baat he jis par use vishwaas he
 The initial scenes of the first issue are reinforced by reading all this when Estragon asks Vladimir what he has requested of Godot: vladimir: oh 


 kuch khaas nahin
 Estragon: Any prayer
 vladimir: kuch had tak
 Estragon: a vague plea
 vladimir: bilkul sahi
 Much of the play is concerned with the subject of religion, which is largely related to written allusion
 puraa kaa puraa naatak ek pahari ke upar hota he jise kuch log swarg kii sangya de sakate hai jisase naatak ko ek dharmik drushtaant hone kaa uddeshy praapt hota he

 "in response to a question asked by defense counsel in 1937 whether they were Christians or Jews or atheists, Beckett said 'none of the three'"
 On looking at Beckett's entire work, Mary Bryden discovered that "the imaginary God that emerges from Beckett's texts is a person who is damned for his perverse absence as well as his attentive presence
" jiske parinamswaroop unhen padchut kar diya jaataa he, un par vyangy kiya jaataa he yaa unhen nazarandaaj kar diya jaataa he lekin unhen or unke pratadit bete ko nishchit rup se kabhi nahin hataaya jaataa he
 On a symbolic level, we can see the two characters Estragon and Vladimir as the two thieves mentioned in the play
 estrogan ko kuch agyaat kaarnon ke liye dandit kiya jaataa he jiskaa matlab ho saktaa he ki vah vahi chor he jisase messiah ko kosne ke liye ghrinaa kii jaati he
 On the other hand, Vladimir may be the thief who escaped condemnation although it is only physical
 is pratikaar se baket dwaara darshaae gaye manamaane ishwar kaa pataa chalata he
 Waiting for Godot is described as "a metaphor of hiking in Roussillon when Beckett and Suzanne slept in a heap of grass during the day, and kept going until it was night for Joyce to consider Beckett's relationship" 
 " The initial draft contained important personal references but was later removed
 chunki naatak main keval purush abhinaytaon kaa sandarbh miltaa he kyonki usamen mahilaon kaa sandarbh shaayad hi miltaa he isliye kuch log vladimir or estrogan ke rishte ko ardh-vaivaadhik maanate hai: "ve jhagadate hai, ve ek duusare ko gale lagaate hai, ve ek duusare par nirbhar karte hai ve unhen ek shaadishuda jodi mana ja saktaa he
 "in the first issue Estragon speaks softly to his partner by going slowly to him and placing his hand on his shoulder
 badale main uskaa haath maangane or use jid na karne kii salaah dene ke baad vah use achaanak gale laga letaa he lekin yah shikaayat karte hue usee teji ke saath peeche hat jaataa he ki "tumse lahasun kii badboo aa rahi he!" When Estragon reminds him of his contemporary scenes in the Bible and remembers how beautiful the colors of the Dead Sea or Dead Sea maps were, he comments that "we will go there, i always said that we would go on our honeymoon We will go there
 We will swim
 We will have fun
 " Also, in the context of a world without women, there is a temptation to get postmortem erections
 vladimir kii tulana main khaas taur par estrogan "bahut zyada utsahit" hota he jo is maukey par chitkaar vishakhmul ke bare main baat karne kaa vikalp chunata he
