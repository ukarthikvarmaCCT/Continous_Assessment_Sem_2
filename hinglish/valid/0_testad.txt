 bihar police main sab kuch thik-thaak najar nahin aata
 Following the confrontation of trainee soldiers with top police officers on November 2, the state police headquarters took an unprecedented hard step and sacked 175 constables on November 4
 inamen 167 nae bhartee or aath niyamit rangarut shaamil hai
 But the Police Headquarters needs to conduct a much deeper investigation as to why the constables do not have confidence in their top officers and for what reasons this came about
 hinsa main shaamil logon ke alaava police prashasan ne 23 pulicekarmiyon ko nilambit bhi kiya he
 There are also two traffic policemen who were working for the welfare of the trainee soldiers
 magar yah karrwai naakaafi najar aati he
 In fact, on late November 2, about 400 policemen of Patna Police Lines, comprising a large number of women, revolted against their top officers
 unhone varisht afasaron ke saath hinsak badsuluki kii, sarkari gharon main todfod kii, kareeb 20 police vaahanon ko tod-phod diya or bade paimaane par patharbaji kii
 In this, several policemen were injured including the bodyguard of the Deputy Superintendent of Police (police Lines)
 mahila javaanon ke is hinsak updrav se bihar police ko baari sharmindagi jhelni padi or uski chhavi ko batta laga
 The constable was angered by the death of his companion Savita Pathak and only then did she perform this violent demonstration
 21 varshiya prashikshu consteble savita kii maut 2 november ko alssubah patna ke ek nijee nursing home main ho gai thi
 The constables accused the senior police officers of delaying the discharge of Savita for treatment
 savita kii saathiyon ke mutabik, vah pichley kuch dinon se biimaar thi or maut ke teen din pehle apni duty ke dauraan behosh bhi ho gai thi
 He was posted for traffic duty at Kargil Chowk in Patna where he was required to pay regular duty despite poor health
 uske parivaar ke sadasyon ne bhi bade afasaron par laaparvaahee or krurta baratane kaa aarope lagaaya he
 Savita was admitted to a private hospital on 31 October
 jab uski sehat main koi sudhaar nahin hua to use waapas police line laayaa gaya jahaan 1 november kii raat ko uski haalat or bighad gai
 The next day he was rushed to Udayan Udayan Hospital, but soon died around 6 pm
 shuruaati medical reporton se pataa chalata he ki vah gambhir anemia (khun kii kami) or septicemia (khun ke sankraman) se peedit thi
 His leukocyte count dropped to 2
 83 lakh par aa gai thi, jo bahut hi kam thi
 Savita, a resident of Siwan, joined the police in August this year as a constable
 jahiraa taur par use ilaaj main deree kii vajah se apni jaan ganvaani padi
 a section of constables has alleged that Savita's case is not an isolated case
 ek prashikshu mahila consteble ne bataaya, ‘‘kai prashikshu consteble aisi hi haalat se guzar rahe hai
 Their leave is granted only when they reach an emergency
 yah amanviya he
 "it's not just that
" prashikshu javaanon ne yah bhi aarope lagaaya he ki unhen behad dayaneey halaat main rahane ke liye majaboor kiya jaataa he
 50 jawans are kept in a single barrack and food is also given very poorly
 unke prashikshan kaa kaarykram bhi bahut sakht he
 This is the reason why many women constables faint almost everyday in the parade ground
 kai prashikshuon ne kaha ki unhen mahaj 10 dinon kii training di gai or phir police gasht main, trephic chauraahon par or viypi avaagaman ko sanbhaalane ke liye tainaat kar diya gaya
 Apparently, they have to work in challenging conditions at the beginning of their careers without any training
 yah sahi he ki savita kii maut or uske baad hue hinsak updravon ne patna police line kii taraf logon kaa dhyaan khinchaa he, par police prashasan or khaas taur par mahila constablon par niyantran rakhane vaala prashasan lambey samay se apriy surkhiyon main rahaa he
 Just two days before the constables' nuisance, an FIR was lodged against the Bihar Military Police (BMP) Subedar Shambhu Sharan Rathore, as a trainee woman constable accused him of molesting his office
 tab bhi saikadon mahila prashikshu consteble ikattha ho gai thim or unhone aapraadhik maamla darj karne ke saath hi aaropee ko fouran giraftaar karne kii maang kii thi
 a top IPS officer says that top officers, especially those deciding duty rosters, have to be made sensitive towards women constables
 rajya police bal main mahilaon ke liye 33 fisadi aarakshan kii badaulat mahila constablon or sab-inspectoron kii taadaad baduya tay hi he
 Earlier in March this year, it was revealed that a large number of policemen of 200 have been 'missing' from the police lines for the last one year
 iske alaava, paaya yah bhi gaya ki anya 300 javaanon ne maheenon se koi duty hi nahin kii thi
 Ironically, all these 500 jawans were getting their regular salaries

 You will be surprised if a person who sells mother-made papadas on a bicycle, goes from house to house, becomes a 'guarantee' to get poor children into big institutions like Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) lekin yah sach he
 Something similar is the story of Anand Kumar, the founder of the famous Super-30 institute in Patna
 sarkari vidhyalay ke chaatr anand ko shuru se ganit main ruchi thi, or unhone bhi vaigyanik or ejeeniyar banane kaa sapana dekha tha
 To make his dream come true, he was also invited to study at Crambridge University, but his dream could not be fulfilled due to the weak financial condition of the family
 isi tis ne unhen garib bacchon kii pratibha nikhaarane kii prerana di
 Anand told that the University of Cambridge could not go, but in the meantime, on August 23, 1994, the father died due to a heart attack
 unke pita dak vibhaag main chitthee chhaantane kaa kaam karte the, parantu unhone pita ke nidhan ke baad anukampaa se milane vaali naukari na karne kaa faisla liya
 He says that everything was going contrary to his thinking, but he decided that if i do the job, i will not get a chance to show talent in mathematics
 ' arthabhaav ke kaaran ghar-parivaar chalaanaa mushkil hone laga
 Then his mother started making papad at home for livelihood and Anand and his brother went from house to house selling papad on bicycle
 jindagi jaise-taise chalane lagi
 Anand then thought of teaching tuition to the children
 unhone ghar main hi 'ramanujam skool of mathematics' naam se koching kholi
 Initially, only two students came in coaching
 is dauraan vah chaatro se 500 rupee fees lete the
 During this time, a student came to him who said that he wants to study tuition, but he has no money
 yah baat anand ke dil ko chhu gai or unhone use padhaanaa sweekaar kar liya
 That student passed the entrance exam of IIT
 anand kehete hai ki yah unke jivan kaa 'ternig point' tha
 After this, in the year 2001, he established Super-30 and started preparing poor children for IIT entrance examination
 vah kehete hai ki ab unka sapana ek vidhyalay kholane kaa he
 He says that due to poverty many children leave studies and start earning a livelihood
 anand kii super-30 ab kisi parichay kii mohataaj nahin he
 At present 330 children have enrolled in Super 30 so far, out of which 281 students have passed the entrance exam of IIT, and the remaining have reached other engineering institutes
 ullekhneey he ki discovery channel ne super-30 par ek ghante kaa vruttchitr banaaya, jabaki 'times' patrika ne super-30 ko asia kaa sabase behatar skool kaha he

 yusuf auto chaalak hai
 He said that he left the house in the morning with an auto
 lekin kareeb 12 baje unke ghar se phone aayaa ki ve dopaher ke khaane ke liye ghar na aaen
 The atmosphere is bad
 darasal jab bhi patharbaji hoti he to vahaan khadi gadiyon ke shishe tod die jate hai
 His auto mirrors have been broken several times
 tair panchar kar die jate hai
 Yusuf said that his son told him, "the atmosphere is very bad because of the death of two minor children in Kulgaon
 yahaan kab patharbaji shuru ho jaaegi, kisi ko nahin pataa
 “on the other hand, the most disputed area down-town, which is currently quiet, has also deteriorated

 Israr (changed name) said that people are very angry with these three deaths
 isliye yahaan ke bhi halaat thik nahin lag rahe
 He says, "the NIA says that the funding leads to stonewalling
" ho saktaa he pehle yah kaaran rahaa ho, lekin ab aisa nahin he
 Similar incidents create anger within the people and people take to the streets to protest
 ab is ghatana ke baad kal kii khabaren aap padhiega, kalejon main patharbaji shuru bhi ho gai he
 "when small children die from police bullets and the news reaches the people," says Israr, hands start searching for stones by themselves
 yusuf kehete hai ki bharat sarkaar lagaataar daawa kar rahi he ki jab se funding main lagaam lagaai gai he patharbaji kam hui he
 But the reality of these claims is known after such incidents
 ''jo goli khaane ko taiyaar ho uski counselling nahin hoti

 ”yusuf, a local resident of Batmalu, told that there was a workshop in Batmalu yesterday

 This counseling has been going on here for years
 par kya koi fark dikhaa? darasal jab tak kashmir samasya kaa sthaayee hal nahin nikalegaa yahaan patharbaji hoti rahegi
 Yusuf says, "it seems strange and poor that you either don't know the problem or you do it to look like you're doing something
" jo log ye jaanate hue ki police goli chalaaegi, marane ke liye baahar gharon se nikal aate hai
 How will you counsel them? i also know this much
 ''udhar police pravaktaa ne bataaya ki 30-35 bacchon or kuchhek ke abhibhavakon ne is workshaap main hissaa liya
 The workshop was successful
 manovaigyanik or samajashastriyon ne bacchon kii counselling kii
 But when the spokesperson was asked about the report made after this workshop on the reasons behind the stone-pelting, he said that it can only be discussed with the DGP, Kashmir
 ve hi aapako kuch bataa sakate hai
 i cannot officially say anything
 haalanki ye jarur bataaya ki pehali baar aisi workshop 2008 main hui thi
 When asked if the police had any comprehensive report in which a detailed study was done about the impact of the workshop, he said, "I cannot say anything about it
" dijipi bataaenge or wo encounter main aaj vyast hai

 Government sources said that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting banned the broadcast of the FTV channel for ten days
 yah pratibandh aaj shaam se prabhavi hoga

 During India's victory over Pakistan in the final of the Asian Champions Trophy, the Pakistani head coach used abusive words for the Indian players
 pakistan ke mukhya coach maaikel henrics maaria (holland) stadium kii chat par khadey the or unhen bhartiya khilaadiyon ko gaaliyaan dete hue dekha gaya
 In particular, he used abusive language while Indian players used to make a dent in the Pakistani camp
 pehle half main jab esavi sunil gir gaye or ek pakistani khilaadi se takaraa gayi to maaikel chillaaye, yah foul he
 After this, when Sunil protested in front of the umpire, Michael used profanity for the Indian player
 pakistani coach ne na sirf bhartiya khilaadiyon balki ampiron ko bhi nahin bakhsha
 Whenever the umpire would whistle against India, he would say thank you thank you
 duusare half main ve raghunatha kii pakistani khilaadi se jhadap ho gai thi lekin newjiland ke ampire simon tailor ne use acchhee tarah se sambhaal liya tha lekin holland ke rahane vaale maaikel ne ampire ke aane se pehle hi raghunatha ko gaaliyaan bakani shuru kar di
 Tournament director Brian Fernandes said he would look into the issue and get it investigated if the technical department files a complaint
 fernadiz ne kaha, unhen pehle bhi video tower se koching dene ke liye chetavanee di ja chuki he lekin yadi shikaayat hoti he to main aachaar samhita ke tahat jaanch ke liye kahuunga
 Indian coach Michael Knobs said he heard someone shouting from the roof of the stadium
 unhone kaha, yah kshtakaari tha lekin mujhe lagata he ki isse unki team ko hi nuksaan pahunchaa
 a day before the final, Michael had a fight with two Indian journalists
 jab pakistani team a5yaas kar rahi thi tab unhone bhartiya patrakaron ko stadium se baahar jane ke liye kaha tha
 Pakistan was practicing a penalty corner and journalists were sitting in the stadium as the media room was not open
 is bare main fernadis ne kaha, mujhe nahin lagata ki koi coach patrakaron ko baahar jane ke liye kah saktaa he
 On this, the organizing committee decides whether the exercise will be done on screen or not
 samiti ne aisa kuch nahin kaha tha isliye unhen media ko baahar jane ke liye kehane kaa koi adhikaar nahin tha

 kalam ne apane jivan ke aakhri shabdon se jate-jate ek adarsh naagarik ke liye sawaal chhod diya
 The question is, how to make this world livable on this earth? jyon-jyon loksabhaa ke chunaav najadik aate ja rahe hai, tyon-tyon narendra modi ko yah baat acchhee tarah samaj aane lagi he ki musalamaanon ko apane saath jode bina 'naiya' paar laganaa mushkil he
 This is the reason why Modi has now openly stepped up the practice of doing Muslims in his court
 narendra modi ne shuukravaar ko ahmedabad main kaha ki gujarat ke vikaas main har varg kaa yogadan he, chaahe vah hindu ho yaa muslim
 He further clarified his point that Hindu and Muslim are like two wheels in the development journey
 narendra modi ahmedabad main muslim trade fere main logon ko sambodhit kar rahe the
 Modi resorted to a saying, 'don't be hungry bhajan hohin gopala
 
 
 ' unhone kaha ki bhookha vyakti na to ibaadat kar saktaa he, na hi bhajan
 It can be understood from Modi's statement that in recent times his attitude towards Muslims has become a bit 'clean'
 kul milakar modi ab chunavi bisaat par 'muslim card' chalate najar aa rahe hai
 In the coming days, Modi and how many political moves are going on, the whole country is eyeing this

 Assam, very painfully slowly, was recovering from 2
 5 decades of unrest from 1979
 Things were becoming a bit normal
 Now, the wisdom of our Leadership failed to understand the complexities of Assamese cultural fabric
 The decision to impose CAB is the most unwise ever

 The commissioning of the 25-km-long udhampur-katra railway line passing through ten tunnels and 50 bridges is another chapter in the history of Indian Railways
 atharahavin sadi ke uttarardh main jis rail ne bharat main kadam rakhaa tha, uske jaise pankh lag gaye hai or aaj ve himalay ke durgam raastonke upar bhi fail gaye hai
 This railway line is not important because it connects a large religious place in India with the rest of India but also shows its engineering and its skills in the Himalayas
 saikadon saalon tak himalay bharat ke saamne ek chunauti kii tarah khada rahaa or isaki oonchi-oonchi parvatamalaon par rail line bichaane kii baat sochna bhi ek sapana tha lekin ab vah puraa hota dikh rahaa he
 Built at a cost of Rs 1,132 crore, the railway line will eventually become a lifeline for Jammu and Kashmir
 pichhali sadi main bhartiya rail keijiniyaron or karmiyon ne i shridharan ke kushal netritv main konkan rail kii pariyojna puri karke duniya bhar main apni kirti failaai
 In Jammu and Kashmir, we are getting to see the amazing engineering
 himalay par ek baar phir vijay kii taiyaari he
 The laying of the railway line on the Himalayas is also of strategic importance to India
 china ne jis tarah apni rail kaa prasar kiya he vah hairaan kar denevaala he
 He has taken his train to the inaccessible routes of Tibet and is now preparing to take it to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 iskaa matlab yah hua ki china rail se sidhe bharat kii seemaa tak aa pahonchega
 It is not only surprising but also of concern
 isse na keval bade paimaane par sajo saamaan balki sainik bhi pahunchaae ja sakate hai
 On the other hand, China is also preparing to lay rail lines in the northeast
 raksha kii drushti se vah bhi ek mahatvapurn ilaaka he jahaan kaaphi samay se china nazren gadaaye baitha he
 In such a situation, the role of Indian Railways becomes very important
 hamen bhi uskaa un ilaakon tak vistaar karnaa hi hoga or na keval simaaon kii raksha ke vichaar se balki vyapaar badhaane ke lihaaj se bhi
 We all know that China has become a very large trading partner of India in recent years and we do about $ 80 billion in trade annually with it and it is estimated that it will increase to $ 100 billion by 2015
 itihaas gavaah he ki bharat kaa china ke saath vyapaar kaa rishta behad purana he or vah vikhyath silk root jisase us jamaane main donon deshon ke vyapaaree aate-jate the, ab praasangik nahin rah gaya he
 Trade on such a large scale is now done by sea vessels which cost more and also takes a lot of time
 is drushti se bhi himalay kii oonchi-nichi ghaatiyon main rail chalaanaa jaruri he
 But it is not as easy as it looks
 in pariyojnaon ke liye railway ko 80,000 karod rupye kii jarurat hogi or tab 14 relline bich sakengi jinamein teen purvottar main hai
 Obviously this is a huge amount and now it is to be seen how the new government takes the lead

 If the government wants to save someone, the public prosecutor weakens the case against it and presents it in the court

 She does not know the work of Hanuman and secondly she does not know about history

 ’ After the terrorist attack in Pulwama, the Indian Air Force has gone to the loc and took strong action in Balakot

 In this action, the largest terrorist camp of jaish-e-mohammed is reported to be destroyed
 dapsasal, pakistan main jaish kaa sabase bada aatanki camp balakot main hi he
 The same Balakot which falls in the Khyber Pakhtoon area of pakistan
 yah ilaaka pakistan ke pradhanmantri imran khan ke kshetra main padataa he
 Yusuf Azhar used to run this biggest terrorist camp of Jaish
 sena or bhartiya khufia agenciyon ko balakot ke is camp ke bare main kaaphi samay se jaankaree thi
 Yusuf Azhar was also named in the list of terrorists who hijacked the plane in Kandahar in 1999
 vah jaish chif masood azhar kaa rishtedaar main saalaa bataaya jaataa he
 His name was also included in the list of fugitives handed over to Pakistan by India in 2002

 Journalists should not get confused about how their writing will be welcomed, they should just sit down and write
 lekin khilaadi sachin tendulkar par sidhe kalam chalaane ke pehle mujhe jaraa sachin tendulkar rupi vishay par ekaadh baaten kar lene dijie
 i have written a lot on them, yet i feel happy and content every time
 unhen khelte dekhnaa jitna aanandadaayak he, unke bare main likhnaa bhi vaisaa hi he— maukey-bemauke unke bahuaiami or preranaaspad andaaj kii tarah
 Many times in my profession, a player and his performance is called 'inspirational' without any good example, without knowing whether he has really inspired anyone or is just excited
 lekin tendulkar ke maamle main anayas satark ho janaa padataa he kyonki un par kalam chalaate vakt aap yah sochakar apana shreshth pesh karne kii koshish karte hai ki log ise jarur padhenge, samajhenge or gambhirtha se vichaar karenge
 It is no wonder that the mind becomes happy just by thinking about them
 tendulkar kaa samay bhi kaaphi ho-halle or hangaame vaala he
 Much of the time of average cricket journalists, emerging rapidly in the last quarter century, has been spent focusing on sharp tantrums, raging statements and scams outside the field
 vaaki, ham lekhakon ko jitani tendulkar kii darkaar he, utani hi unke prashansakon kii
 He has reminded us from time to time why we want to write on cricket itself
 tendulkar jitani aasaani se shreshth pradarshan karte hai, usne hamen phir se apane jawan prashansak ke sampark main rahane kaa avasar de diya
 This is why sometimes we lose their reference, get emotional
 unki mahanata main hamane apana kuch swaarth viksit kar liya he—kul maamalon main vittiya swaarth, bhale hi meraa nahin sahi
 He has also been tested in the last few years
 ve betarah sangharsh karte dekhe gaye
 On several occasions, it seemed to him that posthumously a warrior in his war dress had been sent to break the fort by sitting on a horse
 isliye khel se unki vidaai kaa dukh to he magar ek tarah kii raahat bhi he kyonki ab tendulkar ko jhelte nahin dekhnaa padegaa
 We will eventually be able to get out of that dilemma as to who will fill their void
 philhal to unki jagah koi nahin le saktaa, bas unka uttaradhikari hi talashna hoga
 Football teams keep jersey numbers of famous and famous players separately, so that their succession does not become a burden on anyone
 lekin kisi ko to bhartiya team main chauthe number par ballebaaji kerani hi padegi, shaayad viraat kohli karen
 Kohli is an unmatched player, but like Tendulkar, he has to define his phase with hard work
 lekin kinhin kamajoriyon kii vajah se unki khyaati nahin honi chahie kyonki mujhe dar he, aajkal khel main badi teji se bahari tatwon kaa prabhaav padane laga he
 This is the irony of our time
 ab khub paise vaala ban janaa aasaan he lekin mahaan khilaadi bananaa behad mushkil he
 In such a way, how can we understand the greatness of Tendulkar? You can divide the pre-conditions of greatness of cricket into two parts
 pehla pahalu he pradarshan or uplabdhi
 Tendulkar has been playing the same scale consistently throughout the round
 unhone ranon kaa vishaal pahaad banaaya
 What he did in the playground became an era in the sports world
 or yah sab unhone kabhi beman se sirf vakt kaatane ke liye nahin kiya
 His standard remained constant, he never let it fall
 cricket main ham 'form’ kii baat karte hai
 This is a kind of intermediate stage
 yah mood, daur yaa lahar kii tarah aata-jaataa rahata he
 But Tendulkar's case is an exception, in the case of a batsman after Bradman, 'form' did not seem so irrelevant
 beshak unke achche or bure din rahe hai, lekin yah unke apane banaae paimaane se tay hote hai ki kisi gendbaaj ko lekar unamem duvidha he yaa phir kisi khaas paristhiti main behad dabaav mahasoos kar rahe hai
 If he ever found himself in trouble then the audience did not let it be realized
 agar tendulkar pichley world cap ke baad ritair ho gaye hote to unke maamle main 'form’ kii charchaa kabhi nahin hoti
 And perhaps his powerful bat would always be on high
 bhartiya team ke chayankartaaon kii beshak apni chunautiyaan rahi hai, lekin ek myne main vah aasaan bhi rahi he
 He needed to select only 10 players each time, Tendulkar was always included in the team list, provided they were available
 mahanata kaa doosraa pahalu aankadon or sandarbhon kaa he
 Consider this
 tendulkar 199 test khel chuke hai
 Of these, India won in 71 and lost 56
 pehali najar main yah aankada utana nahin chaunkaata, jitna unka vyaktigat record
 This proves to be a disappointment against the win-loss figures of Ricky Ponting, as he played 168 Tests, won his team in 108 and had to face defeat in only 31
 isi tarah 463 ekadivasiy international maichon main tendulkar khele to 234 match bharat jeeta
 Ponting played in 375 odis in Australia and his team won 262 matches
 kul milakar yah kaha ja saktaa he ki tendulkar ke daur main bharat kaa bhagya ausat safalataa kaa hi rahaa he, khaskar videshi dharti par
 And India managed to win only one World Cup in this entire tour, which is nothing in front of a pile of trophies, trinkets and other citations in Ponting's case
 na hi tendulkar us match main kuch khaas kar paae, jisaki trophy unhen samarpit kii gai
 Kohli later said, "he has carried the honor of the nation on his shoulders for the last 21 years
 isliye ab samay aa gaya he ki ham unhen apane kandhon par uthaaen
 "tendulkar's phase as captain proved to be meaningless that he surrendered only after a few opposing tones and never stood in the line of the role
 ve bataur agua 25 test maichon main sirf chaar hi match jeet paae
 It is not a blot on his career, but a void
 na unhone captaini main koi chhap chodi, na captaini kaa un par koi asar hua
 If we stop here, we will not know much
 tendulkar ke record kii jaraa gavaskar se tulana kiijie
 Gavaskar played 125 Tests in which India won 23 and lost 34
 ve 108 ek divasiy khele, jisamen bharat 49 jeeta or 56 haar gaya
 In this way, the total deposit of Gavaskar's career is that he drew a Test and lost one day
 lekin tendulkar kaa daur vah he, jisamen bharat duniya kii baaki tiimon se maamuli nahin, balki acchhee badhat hasil karne ke liye damakham paane kaa sangharsh kar rahaa tha or usne vah hasil karke dikhaaya
 Many figures stand in evidence of this
 yah kathin sankraman kaa daur rahaa he, jisamen bharatiyon ne baaki duniya ke mukaable apane bare main dharna badali he
 Tendulkar is not very proud as a symbol of this India Shining
 ve shant or vinamr bane rahe hai
 But he has helped a lot in making his country invincible by acquiring a proud place in his old and new era
 unhone cricket or apane deshavaasiyon ke liye ek nayaa sansar khol diya or isi vajah se yah khel or desh unka sammaan karata he
 There is also a kind of moral lesson in the ratio of win-lose
 apane daur ke sabase majboot ballebaaj ke maidan main hone ke baavjood bhi bharat sirf ek-tihaai test hi jeet paaya
 In other words, Tendulkar is certainly great, but he cannot build a success alone
 iske liye mahaan team kii jarurat hoti he
 As has been the case most of Ponting's career and his team has been at the top level
 tendulkar kai anokhi tiimon main kuch anokhe khiladinnon ke saath khel chuke hai
 But India has been able to get the number-one Test team status for a short time
 ekadivasiy maichon kii talika main to vah kabhi sabase upar nahin rahi
 It can be said that Tendulkar carried on the mission that Gavaskar started, but perhaps no one alone can complete it
 mahanatam cricket hero bhi apane akele dam par duniya kaa sirmaur nahin ban saktaa, khaskar ab jabaki antarrashtriya cricket teen hisson main bant gaya he
 Dravid, Ganguly, Laxman, Sehwag, Dhoni, Kumble and Zaheer helped Tendulkar in building the lofty edifice of Indian cricket, now that Kohli, Dhawan, Pujara and Rohit have to maintain their heights
 is tarah tendulkar kaa kariyar vyaktigat vijay kii ibaarat he, jisase samuhikta ke mahatv kaa bhi pataa chalata he
 Similarly, Tendulkar's career is the footsteps of millions of others in one person's unique progress
 yah shaayad duusare maidaanon se adhik swaabhaavik rup se ethiliton ke bare main kaha ja saktaa he, lekin tendulkar to us duusari jamaat main hai, jise ji
 K
 chesterton apane prasiddh ukti main kehete hai, ''mahaan vah hota he jo dusron ko chota sabit kar detaa he, lekin asli mahaan vyakti vah hota he jo har manushya ko mahanata kaa anubhav karaata he
 "and in the case of Tendulkar, especially in India, every woman-man, poor-rich, weak-powerful, as well as wherever cricket is played, includes its people
 isamen patrkaar bhi hai
 Former England coach Duncan Fletcher will be the new coach of the Indian cricket team

 He has also captained the Zimbabwe cricket team during the World Cup
 dancan flechar england ke purv coach rah chuke hai
 After India won the World Cup, coach Gary Kirsten said goodbye to the Indian team
 iske baad se coach kii talash shuru ho gai thi
 Initially, the names of Stephen Fleming and Andy Flower were coming to coach the Indian team but the Indian Cricket Board has finally given Duncan Fletcher the responsibility of the coach of the Indian team
 mana ja rahaa he ki dancan flechar ke naam kii sifarish khud gairi karston ne kii thi
 Not only this, Fletcher's good record as a coach was also a major factor in making him an Indian coach
 bhartiya cricket board ke sachiv en shrinivasana ne kaha ki flechar ko 2 saal ke liye niyukt kiya gaya he
 Fletcher will take over from India's West Indies tour in early June

 com / ev8ybmnwkr Tejashwi Yadav, leader of the opposition of Bihar, has once again attacked the BJP
 unhone kaha ki bijepi shuru se hi dalit virdohi he or wo aarakshan ko khatm karnaa chaahati he
 In a special conversation with Aaj Tak, Tejaswi said that the reconsideration petition filed by the BJP is fraud
 ham hameshaa unki suraksha ke liye aawaaj uthaate rahenge
 Tejashwi said that the court had reconsidered the petition, what was the reason that the review petition had to be inserted
 centre sarkaar ke numaayinde court ke saamne gaye the
 He did not put his side firmly, because the people who are sitting in the center are the people of Godse, the people of Baba Golwalkar, these people are always anti-dalit
 tejasvi ne kaha ki hamaari maang he centre sarkaar agar chaahati he ki kanoon jaise tha vaisaa hi rahe to court- kachhari main jane kii kya jarurat he aap sidhaa ordinance le aaie
 Make the law firm
 No one can tamper with what our law is, it will be safe
 hamaare dalit surakshit rahenge, hamaare adivasee surakshit rahenge
 After all, what is the problem in bringing ordinance to the schedule? This is a shocking thing in the eyes
 badi chaalaaki se bijepi ke log samvidhan ko mitaanaa chaahate hai, aarakshan ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai or SC / ST kanoon ko khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 He said that the idol of Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar was destroyed in Uttar Pradesh and who were the people who broke it? Those who broke it were the people of the same association and the BJP
 in logon kii kathani or kerani main antar he
 In this case, the atomic general should have appealed himself, there is no junior lawyer
 agar himachati hai to aapako aane main kya dikkat he aap bhi to aisa hi chaahate ho naa ki kanoon aisa kaa aisa hi rahe
 If you are so supportive, then bring the law in the schedule, make the law firm
 tejasvi ne dalit act ke durupyog par kaha ki afvaah failaai jaati he ki durupyog karaayaa jaataa he
 If we talk about abuse, then which law is being misused more than alcohol ban? 1,30,000 Dalits are the most in jail
 unhone kaha ki yah to jaanch karne kaa maamla he agar dalit koi shikaayat karata he to jaanch athurity hi karegi
 How can someone sit outside and say that the law is being abused, how can someone say that a false case has been done or a real case has been done? That is why we demand the law which is that he said that the BJP is in power and if the highest record is seen, then atrocities on Dalits have increased in BJP ruled states only
 yah aankada bataata he ki kyon bijepi shasit rajya main sabase zyada 'bhai' hote hai
 Earlier this did not happen in a state like Haryana, but it started happening there after the formation of the BJP government

 Had there been a law here, we would have been at least safe
 agar dekha jaae to SC / ST kii bahusankhyak aabaadi he agar inaki aawaaj ko ham log nahin uthaaenge to kinaki aawaaj ko uthaaenge? gaiyr-barabari ke khilaaf ladanaa he, inako mukhyadhara main laana he, inako surakshit rakhana he yahi to hamaari vichaardhaara bataati he
