 The construction or use of an instrument is for the purpose of extracting the sound of music
 siddhant rup se, koi bhi vastu jo dhwani paidaa karti he, vaadya yantra kahi ja sakati he
 The history of instruments begins at the beginning of human culture

 Music composed using only instrumental music is called instrumental music

 However, most historians believe that it is impossible to determine a specific time of the invention of the instrument, being subjective to the definition

 The tomb to which these instruments belonged was dated to carbon dating between 2600 and 2500 BCE, providing evidence that these instruments were being used in Sumeria by this time

 Scholars agree that there is no completely reliable way of determining the exact chronology of instruments in different cultures
 unki jatilta ke aadhaar par vaadyayantron kii tulana or unka aayojan bhraamak he, chunki vaadyayantron main hone vaale vikaas ne kabhi-kabhi jatilta ko kam kiya he
 For example, the construction of early slit drums involved harvesting and hollowing out huge trees; Later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stems, which was quite easy
 isi prakaar kaarigari ke aadhaar par vaadyayantra ke vikaas ko yojit karnaa bhraamak he, chunki sabhi samskritiyaan vibhinn staron par vikaas karti hai or unhen alag-alag samagriyaan uplabdh hoti hai
 For example, anthropologists attempting to compare instruments created by two cultures that existed at the same time, which differed in their formation, culture, and handicraft, could not determine which instruments were more "primitive"
 bhugol ke aadhaar par yantron ko kramit karnaa bhi aanshik rup se avishwasaneey he, kyonki koi yah nirdhaarit nahin kar saktaa ki kab or kaise samskritiyon ne ek duusare se sampark kiya or aapas main gyaan saajha kiya
 The German music scientist, Kurt Sax, who is the most prominent music scientist and anthropologist of modern times, suggests that a geographical chronology dating to about 1400 is better, as it is limited subjectively
 1400 ke upar, samyavadhi ke aadhaar par vaadyayantra ke samgr vikaas ko liya ja saktaa he
 The science of marking the sequence of development of instruments is dependent on archaeological crafts, artistic notation and literary references
 chunki kisi ek anusandhan maarg main aankade adhure ho sakate hai, sabhi teen maarg ek behatar aitihaasik tasviir uplabdh karaate hai
 European music history, written until the 19th century, begins with these mythological descriptions of how instruments were invented
 aise vivaranon main shaamil he jubaal, can ke vanshaj or "un sabhi kaa pita jo harp or organ sambhalate hai", paan, panpipe ke avishkaarak or marakari, kaha jaataa he jisane kachhue ke sookhe khol se pehla lahore banaaya tha
 Modern history has replaced such mythology with anthropological speculation and is sometimes corroborated by archaeological evidence
 vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki vaadyayantra kaa koi nishchit "avishkaar" nahin kiya gaya, chunki "vaadya yantra" shabd kii paribhaasha vidwaan or bhavi-avishkaarak, donon ke liye puri tarah se vyaktiparak he
 For example, a Homo Habilis slapping his body could be an under-construction instrument regardless of its intent
 maanav sharir se pare jin upkarnon ko pratham vaadyayantra mana jaataa he, ve hai jhunjhune, stamper or vibhinn prakaar ke drum
 ye aarambhik yantra, bhaavnaatmak harkaton, jaise nrity main dhwani jodne ke maanav ke sanchaalan aaveg ke kaaran viksit hue

 un samskritiyon ne adhik jatil parakashan upkarnon or anya upkarnon kaa vikaas kiya, jaise riban read, bansuri or turahiyaan

 The early cultures for which drums developed ritualistic and even sacred significance are the Chukchi people of Far Eastern Russia, the native people of Melanisia, and many cultures in Africa
 In fact, in every African culture, drums were widely present
 ek purvi africa janajati, vahinda ise itnaa pavitra maanati thi ki sultan ke alaava ise dekhne vaale kisi anya vyakti ke liye yah ghaatak hota tha
 Eventually humans developed the concept of using instruments to produce melodies
 vaadyayantra ke vikaas main is samay tak, raag, sirf gayan main hi aam tha
 Similar to the process of repetition in language, instrumentalists first developed repetition and then instrumentalization
 An early form of melody was produced by banging a tube of two different sizes - one tube produced a "clear" sound and the other produced a "deep" sound
 aise yantron ke jode main bullrorer, slit drum, sip turahiyaan or khaal drum bhi shaamil he
 Cultures that used pairs of these instruments linked gender with them; The "father" was a larger or more energetic device, while the "mother" was a smaller or slower device
 sangeet ke vaadyayantra hazaron varshon tak is rup main bane rahe, jab tak ki praarambhik zylophone ke rup main, sur ke teen yaa usase adhik pattern kaa vikaas nahin hua
 Xylophone originated in the mainland and archipelago of Southeast Asia and from there it spread to Africa, America and Europe
 Along with the xylophone, which ranged from a simple three "leg bar" set to a carefully tuned set of parallel bars, various cultures developed instruments such as the Bhumi Veena, Bhumi Jithar, musical Dhanush and Jau Harp

 lokapriy vaadyayantra, saral or kisi ke bhi dwaara bajaae jane yogya, bhinn rup se peshewar yantron se viksit hue jinke vikaas ne kaushal or prabhaav par dhyaan kendrit kiya
 Despite this development, very few instruments have been recovered in Mesopotamia
 mesopotamia main vaadyayantron ke praarambhik itihaas ko phir se sangathit karne ke liye vidwaanon ko sumerion yaa acadian main likhi kalakritiyon or keelakaar lekh par bharosa karnaa chahie
 Even the process of naming these devices is challenging since there is no clear distinction between the various tools and the words used to define them

 Rather, the history of musical instruments in the region begins with the Indus Valley Civilization which dates back to around 3000 BC

 The various rattles and whistles found with the artifacts found in the excavations are the only physical evidence of the instrument

 Early Chinese philosophers such as Confucius and Mencius and Laoji shaped the development of instruments in China and adopted a similar approach to music as the Greeks did
 The Chinese believed that music was an essential part of character and community, and developed a unique system of classifying their instruments according to their material makeup

 People began writing books about the making, playing and cataloging of instruments; The first such book was Sebastian Firdung's 1511 treatise Musica getuscht und angezogen

 vaadyayantron ko vargeekrut karne ke kai alag-alag tareeke hai
 All methods examine some combination of the physical properties of the instrument, how the music is performed on the instrument, and the position of the instrument in the orchestra or other musical groups
 kuch tareeke, visheshgyon ke bich is asahmati ke parinamswaroop utpann hote hai ki vaadyayantron kaa vargeekaran kaise kiya janaa chahie
 While a complete survey of classification systems is beyond the scope of this article, a summary of the major systems is as follows
 ek pracheen pranali, jo kam se kam 1 shatabdi i
pus
 se chali aa rahi he, vaadyayantron ko chaar mukhya vargeekaran samoohon main vibhajit karti he: ve upkaran jahaan dhwani taar hilaane se utpann hoti he; ve vaadyayantra jahaan dhwani hawa ke khandon ke kampan ke dwaara utpann hoti he; lakdi yaa dhaatu ke bane parakashan vaadyayantra; or chamade ke mukh vaale parakashan upkaran yaa drum

 Erik von Hornbostel and Kurt Sax later took the ancient method and in 1914 published a comprehensive new scheme for classification in Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Ethnologie
 unki paddati ko aaj vyapak rup se prayog kiya jaataa he or ise aksar hornbostel-sacks paddati ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 The original sax-hornbostel method classified instruments into four main groups: sacks ne baad main ek paanchvaan varg joda, electrophone, jaise thermin, jo electronic tareeke se dhwani utpann karte hai
 There are several sub-groups within each class
 is pranali kii aalochana kii gai or ise pichley varshon main sanshodhit kiya gaya, lekin iskaa vyapak rup se prayog organologist or ethnomyuicologist dwaara hi kiya jaataa he
 Andre Schaffner, patron of the MusÃ©e de l'homme, disagreed with the saxe-hornbostel system and in 1932 developed his own system
 shafnar kaa maananaa tha ki ek vaadyayantra ke vargeekaran kaa nirdhaaran, uske vaadan kii vidhi ke bajaay uski shaareerik sanrachana ko karnaa chahie
 His method divided the instruments into two classes: instruments whose body is solid and vibratory, and instruments that have staggered air
 pashchimi vaadyayantron ko bhi, usee parivaar ke anya upkarnon ke saath tulana main aksar unki sangeet seemaa dwaara vargeekrut kiya jaataa he
 These terminologies are based on the classification of singing sounds: kuch upkaran ek se adhik shrenee main aate hai: udhaaharan ke liye, celo ko yaa to tener yaa baas mana ja saktaa he, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki iskaa sangeet samooh main kaise feet baithta he or trombone ho saktaa he olto, tener, yaa baas or french horn, baas, baritone, tener, yaa olto, is baat par nirbhar karte hue kii kis sa par range yah khelaa jaataa he
 Template: Vocal and instrumental pitch ranges kai vaadyayantron main range, unke naam ke hisse ke rup main hota he: sopraano sexophone, tener sexophone, baritone sexophone, olto bansuri, baas bansuri, olto recorder, baas guitar, aadi
 Additional adjectives describe an instrument above the soprano range or below the bass, for example: sopranino saxophone, contrabas clarinet
 jab kisi vaadya ke naam main istemaal kiye jate hai to ye shabd saapeksh hote hai, jo vaadyayantra ke range ko uske parivaar ke anya upkarnon kii tulana main varnit karte hai or na kii maanav awaz ke range main yaa anya pariwaron ke upkarnon kii tulana main
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek baas bansuri kaa range C3 se Fâ™¯6 tak he, jabaki ek baas clerinet ek saptak neeche bajataa he
 Instrumental production is a specialized occupation that requires years of training, practice and sometimes becoming an apprentice

 Some producers make only one type of instrument such as a piano
 bhale hi vaadyayantra main dhwani kaise bhi utpann hoti ho, kai vaadyayantron main upyogkarta interfes ke rup main ek kunjeepatal hota he
 Keyboard instruments are instruments that are played by a musical keyboard
 har kunjee ek yaa ek se adhik dhwani utpann karti he; adhikansh kunjeepatal upkarnon main, in dhvaniyon main utar-chadhaav karne ke liye atirikt saadhan hote hai 
 ve hawa ke hilne se yaa pump karne se dhwani utpann kar sakate hai, hilte taron ko thokkar yaa khinchakar, electronic tareekon dwaara, yaa kisi anya tareeke se

 yadi kshatrap samraat kaa kripapaatr bananaa chahta to vah samraat ke bhaag kii maatra adhik kar detaa
 There was no fixed amount of money for the emperor from the satraps
 saare aay kaa hisaab rakhane tathaa samrat ke bhaag kii nigaraanee karne ke liye rajkeey kysth rahata tha
 He used to get royal orders from the emperor
 is prakaar di hui ajna ke shighratisheeghra paalan kii aashaa kii jaati thi
 In this, even the barrier was considered rebellion
 kshatrapon ko iske liye dand bhi miltaa tha
 And like the Turkish Empire, there was no formality in their punishment
 kshatrapon ke paas samrat kii ajna pahunchaane kii vidhi ke liye ek din kii yatra kii duuri par ek vyakti rahata tha
 The message was sent to each other, to the third, thus to the satraps
 faras ke samraaton ke paas kshatrapon kii adheenta praapt karne ke liye anya prakaar bhi the ek kamishnar ko sena ke sangrakshan ke saath vaataavaran tathaa aavashyaktaa ke anusaar krupa pradaan karne athwa dand dene ke liye bheja jaataa tha
 According to Xenophon, this practice had been going on since the beginning of the empire and was prevalent during its time
 kshatrapon ke kaary kii nigaraanee ke liye samrat swayan samrajya ke prayek pradesh main prativarsh jaaya karata tha
 If he could not go on his own, he would have sent one of his representatives
 kshatrapon ke apane praant main bhoomi kii urvartaa athwa krishi kii abhivruddhi ke liye vishesh prayaas karne par unako kuch or bhi praant pradaan kar die jate kintu jahaan yah suvyavastha nahin praapt hoti thi vahaan se pradesh ko katkar duusare kshatrap praanton main mila diya jaataa tha
 The rule of administration in the provinces was on the emperor, who appointed his brother, a family or son-in-law as a satrap
 bharatvarsh main nahpaan ne apane damaad ushavadaat ko kshatrap bana rakhaa tha
 Due to the close relationship with the emperor, luxury was reflected in the life of satraps like the emperor
 kshatrap ke darbar main bhi samrat kii bhanti aupchaarikta barti jaati thi
 Like the emperor, Kshatrapas used to have their own Antapur
 antpur main clivon kii paryaapt sankhya rahati thi
 Apart from the royal army, there was a personal army of satraps
 samrat kii hi bhanti unke mehalon main bhi udyaan, pramadavan, aadi hote the
 Like emperors, they also used to travel from one place to another in certain months of the year
 kshatrapon ko is prakaar adhik rajkeey shakti swat praapt thi
 Apart from being the commander of military and other powers, there was one more thing, due to which the satraps became very powerful and there was a possibility of their rebellion
 kabhi kabhi ve vidroh kar bhi dete the
 Once the presidency of two or more Kshatrapa provinces was made a single Kshatrap, which was called Mahakshatrap
 inhen adhik sainyashakti tathaa rajkeey shakti praapt hoti thi jo unke vidroh main sahaayak hoti thi
 An example of this is found only during the reign of Darnavosh
 aarokliz ne, jo fijia tathaa lidia donon kaa kshatrap tha, vidroh kar diya tha parvarti shaskaon ke kaal main, visheshkar laghu asia main, kshatrapon ke vidroh adhik hone lage
 This trend of satrap has increased continuously since the time of the miniature Kurusha
 kshatrap kabhi kabhi khulaa vidroh bhi karte the or apane ko swatantra shaasha ghoshit kar dete the
 Many of these rebellious satraps established several dynasties and later became completely independent
 in sabake baavjood samrat unki adheenta praapt karne main safal rahata tha
 The main reason for this was mutual discord and war among the satraps
 iske atirikt darbar main striyon kii adhikta tathaa vyabhichaar ke vaataavaran se bhi kshatrapon ke vyaktitv main sahaj dheelaapan aane lagata tha
 The Kshatrapas did not consider themselves to be appointed for the protection of the provinces, but considered their suzerainty over them
 iskaa ek kaaran yah bhi tha ki kshatrapeey prashasan kii vyavastha anshat anuvanshik bhi thi
 They used to consume landlords and other incomes of Kshatrapa provinces
 xenophan ke samay misia ke ek kshatrap ne upakshatrap bhi niyukt kiya tha jise us pradesh ke log kar dete the or vah ulke badale vyavastha karata tha
 The same arrangement was done for his widow after his death
 is prakaar kii vyavastha ne samrajya ke dhaanche ko sahaj hi dhilaa kar diya
 In later times, the satraps also got the right to operate the state army, especially when it belonged to the royal family or some of its relatives
 laghukurush misia, fizia, tathaa lidia kaa kshatrap tha par yuddh main sampurna sena kaa senapati bhi vahi tha
 The same situation is also with the Farnbases and other satraps, but this does not mean that there was military rule in the Kshatrap provinces
 vastut samrat sainik tathaa samaaj ke adhikariyon, donon ko swayan niyukt karata tha
 He also used to appoint magistrates himself
 kshatrap magistriton ke kaary main hastkshep nahin kar saktaa tha
 The system of regional administration was adopted by Alexander and his successors as well, especially in the kingdom of Silukas
 bharatvarsh main shakon ke jo rajya sthapit hue unamem bhi kshatrapeey rajyavyavastha thi
 Indian satraps had three major dynasties and a dynasty- kapisha, pushppur tathaa abhisar ke kshatrapon kaa pataa vahaan se praapt abhilekhon se miltaa he
 In the Manikyala inscription, there is mention of a Kshatrap, son of Granvvrayak
 use kapisha kaa kshatrap bataaya jaataa he
 The Kabul Museum inscription of the 83rd year mentions a satrap named Tiruvarna of Pushpur
 abhisarprast se praapt ek taanbe kii anguthi ke aakaar kii mudra par kshatrap shivasen kaa naam praapt he
 The Kshatrapas of Punjab belong to three dynasties - mathura ke kshatrap - is vansh main sabase pehla rajuvul athwa ranjuvul tha jisane sambhawatah pehle sakal par bhi rajya kiya tha
 Stancono estimated that lineage as follows: rajuvul kaa naam abhilekhon tathaa mudraon main praapt hota he
 In the Mora Krupa inscription he is called Mahakshatrap
 kintu uski mudraon par praapt lekh main use 'rajaadhiraj' kaha gaya he
 Razuvul was succeeded by Shudas
 abhilekhon main bhi use mahakshatrap kaha gaya he
 Some scholars consider the years given in their inscriptions and some in Vikram Samvat
 is matbhed ko mitaane kaa saadhan abhi tak praapt nahin ho sakaa he
 According to Kono, Kharoshth was Rajvul's brother-in-law and according to Palit, Dahitra
 ek anya mudra par kharoshtee lipi main â€˜kshatrapas prakhar ostas artsputrasâ€™ likhaa hua miltaa he
 There is a difference of opinion among scholars regarding the origin of these satraps
 kabhi unhen palhaav, kabhi shaq desh se aayaa hua bataaya jaataa he
 Probably they were suspicious
 faras se hokar aane ke kaaran ve kshatrapeey shashan vyavastha se parichit or usase sambhddha ho gayi; inke atirikt hagaan or hagaamash naamak do kshatrapon kii bhi mudraayen mathura se praapt hui hai
 Which is supposed to be the ruler of Mathura after the Rajuvul dynasty
 kuch sikkon par donon ke sanyukt naam bhi milte hai or kuch par keval hagaamash kaa hi
 After them there were two to three Kshatrapas in Mathura, whose names are Indian
 kadachit is kaal tak in videshiyon ne purnroop se bhartiyata grahan kar lee thi
 Ujjain's Kshatrapas - Ujjain's Kshatrapas are also called as 'kshatrapas of Western India'
 ye kshatrap do vanshon ke prathit hote hai
 The first dynasty was of Bhumak and Nahapan and the second was of Chashtan
 bhumak ke uttaradhikari nahpaan kaa pataa uski rajat evam tamramudraon se hi nahin varan uske damaad ushavadaat ke abhilekhon se bhi lagaaya jaataa he
 Nahapan also ruled over some part of Western India
 usne satvaahan ke samrajya kaa kuch bhaag bhi jeet liya tha
 Its dynasty is called Shehrat
 shaharaat vansh ko rudradaaman pratham ne samaapt kiya
 In the Girnar inscription he is called Khakharat Vasnivasse Karas
 ujjain main shashan karne vaale dwitiya vansh ke kshatrapon main kardamakavansheey chashton ke pita yasmotik kaa naam sarvapratham aata he
 Chashthan's son Jayadaman was a Kshatrap but he probably died during his father's lifetime and Ujjain was ruled by Chasthan and Rudradamana together
 junagarh abhilekh main mahakshatrap rudradaaman ke sambandh main kaha gaya he ki usne mahakshatrap kii oopaadhi arjeet kii thi
 It seems that the kingdom of his dynasty was probably taken away by Gautamiputra Satakarni and Rudradamon had to earn the title of Mahakshatrap by winning those territories again
 junagarh abhilekh main uski vijayon tathaa uske vyaktitv kii prashasti he
 Rudradaman i was succeeded by his eldest son Damaghasad
 uske pashchaat damaghasad kaa putr jivadaman tathaa uskaa bhai rudrasingh pratham uttaradhikari hue
 It was during this Rudrasingh that the Abhiras captured some part of the state of the Western satraps
 rudrasingh pratham ke uttaradhikari uske teen putr rudrasen pratham, sanghdaaman tathaa damsen hue
 Subsequently, Damasen had three sons, Yashodaman, Vijayasena and Damajadashree Mahakshatrap
 daamajadashri kaa uttaradhikari uskaa bhatija rudrasen dwitiya hua
 After this, he had sons Vishwasinh and Bhartradamana
 bhartrudaman ke hi kaal se uskaa putr vishwasen uskaa kshatrap bana
 What was the relationship between Bhartradaman and Vishwasingh with Mahakshatrap Rudradaman II
 yah nishchaypurvak nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The last satrap of this dynasty was Rudrasingh III who ruled till about 388 AD

 Darshan has been a very ancient tradition in Hinduism
 vaidic darshanon main shaddarshan adhik prasiddh or pracheen hai
 Conspiracy is more famous in Vedic philosophies
 ye sankhya, yoga, nyaay, vaisheshik, mimasaa or veydant ke naam se vidit he
 Their pioneers were Kapil, Patanjali, Gautam, Kanad, Jaimini and Badarayan
 isa ke janm ke aasapaas in darshanon kaa udai mana jaataa he
 Their early signs are also found in the Upanishads
 prayek darshan kaa aadhargranth ek darshanasutra he
 "sutra" is a wonderful style of Indian philosophy
 gine-chune shabdon main siddhant ke saar kaa sanket sutron main rahata he
 Being brief, a detailed commentary and several commentaries were written on the sutras
 bhartiya darshan kii yah style swatantra darshanagranthon kii pashchimi style se bhinn he
 The basis of education and creation of philosophy in accordance with Guru-disciple-tradition is its basis
 yah parampara shaddarshanon ke baad naveen darshanon ke udai main baadhak rahi
 Due to some novelty and differences in the context of interpretations, strains have arisen in the main philosophies
 pramanvichaar, sristimimasaa or mokshasadhana shaddarshanon ke saamaanya vishay hai
 These six philosophies consider the soul in some form or the other
 aatma kii prapti hi moksh he
 They also consider rebirth, ethics, yoga etc
 nyaay, yoga aadi kuch darshan ishwar main vishwaas karte hai
 Sankhya and Mimamsa Darshan are observationalists
 pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan or shabd ye chaar pramaan saamanyat: sabhi darshanon ko maanya hai
 Economics and non-availability are two more proofs in the Mimamsa school
 upanishnmoolak hone ke kaaran inamen vedantadarshan sabase adhik pracheen he
 But other views in the Brahmasutra are denied and his oldest commentary is that of Adi Shankara
 anya darshan sutron ke bhashya isa kii aarambhik shatabdiyon main rache gaye
 Sankhyasutra possibly disappeared
 ishwarkrishna kii "sankhyakarika" sankhya darshan kaa pramanik granth he
 Sankhya philosophy is insurrectional dualism
 iske anusaar prakruti or purush do swatantra or sanathan sattayen hai
 "nature" is the root and the subtle cause of the world
 vah satv, rajas or tamas in teen gunon kii samyavastha kaa naam prakruti he
 The canto begins with a man's contact with nature
 sarg purush kaa bandhan he
 Metaphysics leads to salvation
 apane shuddh chetan kartrutv bhoktrutv rahit swaroop ke gyaan se purush mukt hota he
 The principles of Yoga philosophy are similar to Sankhya
 yogasutra par rachit bhashya or tikaayen yogadarshan kii vistrut parampara kaa aadhaar hai
 The main goal of Yogadarshan is to pave the way to samadhi
 samadhi main chitt kii samast vrittiyon kaa nirodh ho jaataa he
 Practice, quietness and meditation are the main tools of yoga
 ishwar ko bhi dhyaan kaa lakshya banaaya ja saktaa he itnaa hi yogadarshan main ishwar kaa mahatv he
 Ashtanga Yoga, with eight parts of Yama, Niyam, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharna, Dhyana and Samadhi, is a universal path of yoga
 nyaay or vaisheshik pramanpradhan darshan hai
 Justice is a type of Indian logic
 nyayasutra par anek prasiddh tikaayen hai
 Ganges Upadhyaya's "tattvachantamani" started the tradition of Navya Nyaya in Navadvip
 nyaayadarshan ke pehle hi sutara main 16 padaarthon kaa ullekh he
 Through them, there is philosophy, which is the means of liberation or Shreyas
 pramaanon ko vishesh vistaar nyaayadarshan main miltaa he
 Godliness has been considered the tool of salvation in justice
 vaisheshik darshan ek prakaar se nyaay kaa samaan tantra he
 Special or 'nuclear' is its main subject
 parmaanu sristi kaa mul upadan kaaran he
 God is considered to be the reason for the creation of justice-vaishika-darshan
 vaisheshik darshan main sampurna satta ko saat padaarthon main vibhajit kiya gaya he - dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh, samavaay or abhaav
 This division became more valid later on being more relevant than the 16 substances of justice and formed the basis of the joint tradition of nyaya-vaisesika-philosophy which "nyamuktavali" etc
 are represented by the ancient texts
 shaddarshanon main antim do darshanon ko "mimasaa" kaha jaataa he
 These are known as Purvimansa and Uttaraimamsa
 anya darshanon kii apeksha inkaa vedon se adhik ghanishtha sambandh he
 In a way, these are interpretations of Vedic philosophy
 purvamimasaa, mantrasamhita or brahmanon ke karmkand kii vyakhya he
 Uttarmimamsa is the logical explanation of the spiritual philosophy of the Upanishads
 vedon kaa antim bhaag hone ke kaaran upanishdon ko "vedant" kehete hai
 The name of North Mimamsa is also "vedanta"
 in donon mimasaaon ke siddhanton kaa aadhaar vedon main he, kintu vyavasthit darshanon ke rup main inkaa aarambh anya darshanon ke saath saath hi hua
 That is why they are counted in the conspiracies
 donon mimasaaon ke itihaas ke teen charan hai
 They developed in the same northeast in all three phases
 vaidic yug main vedon ke purvabhag main karmkand kaa vidhaan hua
 Spirituality gained prominence in the northern part of the Vedas
 isa kii aarambhik shatabdi main jaimini or baadaraayan ke "mimasaasutra" tathaa "brahmasutra" bhi sambhavat: isi kram main rache gaye
 In the seventh century CE, Kumaril Bhatt and Shankaracharya promoted and propagated the East and the North in the same sequence
 anaatmavaadi hone ke kaaran buddhadarshan kaa aatmavaadi vaidic darshan se virodh he
 Buddhism emerged in the sixth century BCE in the form of revolution against Vedic religion
 anek kaarnon se isa kii chhathi shatabdi main buddha dharm kaa hraas hone laga
 At the same time, Kumaril and Shankaracharya revered both sides of the Vedic religion
 inke baad parthasarathi mishra tathaa madhavcharya ne purvamimasaa darshan kaa vistaar kiya
 Madhvacharya was a minister of King Vukka of Vijayanagar
 baad main sanyas lekar vidyaarany ke naam se shrungery peeth ke shankaracharya pad par asin hue or "panchadshi" naamak praddhi vedant granth kii rachana kii
 Among the four benches that Shankaracharya established on all the four corners of the country for the prestige of Vedantmat, Shringeri Peeth is situated on the Nilgiri Mountains in the south
 anya teen peeth puri, badarikashram or dwarka main hai
 Shankaracharya composed the languages on Upanishads, Brahmasutra and Gita
 shankaracharya ke baad vachaspati mishra, shri harsh aadi aacharyon ne vedant parampara kaa vistaar kiya
 The main goal of Purvimamsa is to arrange Vedic rituals
 iske anusaar vedamantron kaa mukhya arth vidhi athwa karm ke aadesh main he
 Mantras which do not have a judicial verb are "economism" and seek gods etc
 yadi yagyadi karm se ek divya shakti utpann hoti he jise "apurv" kehete hai
 This is the regulator of uncommon karma
 purvamimasaa main ishwar maanya nahin he
 The Vedas are eternal and apaurusheya
 nity shabd kaa kalp kalp main yathapurv sphot hota he or apurv kii shakti se yathapurv sristi kii utpatti hoti he
 The soul of Purvimamsa is as consciousnessless as Vaiseshika
 nyaay darshan ke char pramaanon ke atirikt arthapatti or anuplabdhi do pramaan or mimasaa darshan main maane jate hai
 Answer: Mimamsa depends on the northern part of the Vedas
 upanishad vedon ke antim bhaag hai, at: ve 'vedant' kehalaate hai
 The more famous name of North Mimamsa is "vedanta"
 brahmasutra or upanishdon kii vyakhyaaon ke dwaara vedant kaa vistaar hua he
 Many Acharyas have explained Brahmasutras and Upanishads from different perspectives
 aacharyon ke vibhinn maton ke aadhaar par vedant ke anek sampradaay ban gaye
 They are famous by the name of Advaita, Vividhavaita, Dvaita etc
 vedant ke ye sampradaay sankhya aadi kii bhanti darshanik nahin hai; in sabhi sampradaayon ke dharmik peeth desh ke vibhinn sthanon main pratishthit hai
 The Acharya tradition of these Peeths is intact till date
 gitadarshan bhi vaidic shaddarshanon ke samakaleen he
 The Gita's Karmayoga is an important fundamental philosophy after the Upanishads' Brahmanism
 sabhi vaidic darshanon ne karmyog kaa mahatv sweekaar kiya he
 Being practical, it can be called representative Indian biography
 gita ke karmyog main aadhyatm or jivan kaa adbhud samanvay hua he
 Historically, it is a syncretism of the Vedic rituals and Brahmanism of the Upanishads
 aadhyatm or karm kaa yah samanvay atyant mahatvapurn he
 The influence of Vedanta of the Upanishads and asceticism of Buddhism and Jainism were so increasing in the Indian public that the effect of seclusion and retirement would have become fatal to the society
 aisi sthiti main gita ne karmyog kaa sandesh dekar desh ko ek sanjivan mantra pradaan kiya
