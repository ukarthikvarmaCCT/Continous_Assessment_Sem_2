 Each such point p will be the focal point of two-dimensional rotation induced by r in B
 is tarah ke sabhi dwivimiya ghurnan samaan ghurnan kone α { \ displaystyle \ alpha } se hote hai
 Rays from o are not displaced in axial plane A; The rays from the Lambic o of a are displaced by the α { \ displaystyle \ alpha} angle; All other rays are displaced by an angle less than α { \ displaystyle \ alpha}

 The fundamental belief of Christianity is that Jesus came to earth with the purpose of paving the way for salvation by ridding mankind of sin
 apane swargarohan ke purv unhone apane shishyon ko adhikaar diya ki baptism dwaara pashchattapi vishvaasiyon ko unke paapon se mukt kar den lekin baptism ke baad manushya paap kar saktaa he, isiliye isa ne papasvikaran kaa sanskaar bhi nishchit kar diya, jiske dwaara pashchattapi manushya apane paapon kaa parihaar kar saktaa he
 This has been the belief of all Christians for centuries
 iskaa aadhaar bible main surakshit isa kaa apane shishyon ke prati yah kathan he- jin logon ke paap tum kshamaa karoge ve apane paapon se mukt ho jaayange, jin logon ke paap tum nahin kshamaa karoge ve apane paapon se bandhe rahenge 
 At the time of worship, from the beginning of Christianity, there is mention of individual confession in addition to mass confession
 paapi praaia: bishap ke saamne apana paap sweekaar karata tha or use praayshchitt karne kaa avasar diya jaataa tha, use puraa karne ke baad hi paapi ke phir ukharist sanskaar grahan karne kii anumati di jaati thi
 The practice of private confession in private in front of a priest was slowly becoming prevalent only after the fourth century
 san 1215 main varsh bhar main kam se kam ek baar papasvikaran karne kaa niyam lagu kar diya gaya tha
 Protestant religion does not consider sin confession as a sacrament by Jesus, and it is unnecessary to commit personal confession regularly

 Barelvi Muheem is a sub-movement under the Sufi movement in South Asia called It is a campaign originated from the Ahle Sunnah Vall Jamaat which was started by Sunni scholar Ahmed Raza Khan Qadri from Bareilly in Rohelkhand in nineteenth and twentieth century India, 
 barelvi sunni hanfi barelvi musalamaanon kaa ek bada hissaa he jo ab bady sankhya main bharat, bangladesh, pakistan dakshin africa evam britain main sanghanit hai
 Ala Hazrat Imam Ahmed Raza Qadri, through his famous fatwa Razvia, made his significant contribution to defending traditional and orthodox Islam in India

 They are also called Salafi because they claim to understand and believe Islam in the same way that Salaf understood the Quran and Sunnah, Salafi Sunni alias Ahle Hadith is mostly in Saudi Arabia
 And are in Qatar
 ye kisi imam kii taqalid nahin karte

 Sufis played an important role in the propagation and spread of Islam in India
 He gained considerable success in the spread of Islam, because in many respects the belief systems and practice of Sufis were similar with Indian philosophical literature, especially non-violence and monotheism
 Sufi orthodox attitudes towards Islam have made it easier for Hindus to practice it
 hazrat khwaja muin-ud-ddeen chishti, kutbuddin bakhtiyaar khurma, nizaam-ud-ddeen auliya, shah jalaal-ud-deen siyuti, aamir khusro, sarkaar sabir paak, shaikh abd-ul-haq dahelvi, ashraf jahangir semnani, sarkaar vaaris paak, ata hossain phani chishti ne bharat ke vibhinn bhaagon main islam ke prasar ke liye sufiyon ko prashikshit kiya
 After the Islamic Empire was established in India, the Sufis clearly provided a touch of love and beauty, saving it from being indifferent and harsh
 The Sufi movement also attracted followers from artisan and untouchable communities; He also played an important role in bridging the gap between Islam and indigenous traditions
 Ahmed Sirhindi, a prominent member of the Naqshbandi Sufi, advocated the peaceful conversion of Hindus to Islam

 kathboli yaa slang kisi bhashaa yaa boli ke un anaupchaarik shabdon or vaakyanshon ko kehete hai jo bolne vaale kii bhashaa yaa boli main maanak to nahin maane jate lekin bolchaal main sweekaarya hote hai
 Linguists believe that puppets have always existed in every standard language, and almost everyone uses them
 aksar ek hi bhashaa samudaay ke vibhinn virgon kii apni bhinn kathboliyaan hoti hai or kisi vyakti dwaara kathboli kaa prayog uskaa kisi vishesh varg main sadsyta kaa sanket hota he
 For example, a Hindi-speaking policeman from Delhi is called 'thulla' in slang while in Mumbai she is called 'mama'
 kabhi-kabhi kathboli bahut lambe arase tak maanak bhashaa kaa bhaag na hote hue bhi prachlit rah sakati he, masalan samaaj ke kuch virgon main thanedaar yaa darogaa ke liye 'thulla' shabd kathboli ke rup main punjab kshetra ke kuch samudaayon main san 1880 main bhi prachlit paaya gaya tha
 Slang is also often used as euphemisms when the standard word for something is considered unpleasant or derogatory to hear, for example 'urine' is called 'susu' in many Hindi-speaking slang
 kabhi-kabhi yah bataanaa kathin hota he ki koi shabd maanak bhashaa kaa bhaag he yaa kathboli he
 The linguists Bethany Dumas and Jonathan Lighter listed some signs of slang for a word or phrase that slang is probably if a word has at least two of these characteristics: kathboli kisi vyavsaayik kshetra main boli jane vaali visheshgy boli se alag hoti he
 Classification is the technical terminology of a particular profession and its words meet only the second criterion from the list above, so slang cannot be called, although they can be used to keep a person outside the profession separate from the group
 
 kuch kathboliyon kaa prayog keval ek vishesh kshetra main hota he, udaharantah fiji hindi main 'kya' kii jagah kabhi-kabhi 'konchi' bolaa jaataa he, jo 'koun chiz' kaa sikuda rup he
 In contrast slang nouns are often associated with a particular subculture such as music or video games rather than territory
 phir bhi kathboli kii abhivyaktiyaan apane vaastavik kshetron se baahar jaakar "kool" or "jive" kii tarah aam taur par istemaal karne laayak ho sakati hai
 While some words eventually lose their status as slang, the use of other words continues to be treated in a similar way by most speakers
 jab kathboli mul rup se iskaa istemaal karne vaale samooh yaa up-samskruti se pare nikal jaati he to iske vaastavik upyogkarta samooh kii pahchaan ko kaayam rakhane ke liye isaki jagah duusare, kam-manyata praapt shabdon kaa prayog karne lagate hai
 One use of slang is to circumvent social prohibitions as mainstream language tries to shy away from appropriating certain realities
 isi kaaran se kathboli kii shabdaawaliyaan kuch khaas kshetra jaise ki hinsa, aparaadh, drugs or sex main vishesh rup se samrudh hai
 Alternatively, slang can only get out of familiarity with the things described
 udhaaharan ke liye californian sharaab ke kadaradaanon main se caburnet sauviganon ko aksar "cab so" ke rup main, cardone ko "card" ke rup main or isi tarah se janaa jaataa he; iskaa matlab yah he ki alag-alag sharaabon kaa namakaran iske anaavashyak prayog ko kam karata he; saath hi yah sharaab ke saath upyogkarta ke apanepan ko darshane main bhi madad karata he
 Even in a language community, slang and the extent to which it is used vary widely across social, ethnic, economic and geographic areas
 kathboli kaaphi samay ke baad prayog se baahar ho ja sakati he; haalanki kabhi-kabhi iskaa prayog adhik se adhik saamaanya ho jaataa he jab tak ki yah kuch kehane kaa ek prabhaavshaalee tarika nahin ban jaataa he, jab aam taur par ise mukhyadhara kii sweekaarya bhashaa ke rup main samajha jane lagata he, haalanki nishedhaatmak shabdon ke maamle main aisi koi abhivyakti nahin bhi ho sakati he jise mukhyadhara yaa sweekaarya bhashaa samajha jaataa ho
 Many slang words enter informal mainstream dialogue and sometimes in formal dialogue, although this can also include a change in meaning or usage
 kathboli main aksar maujuuda shabdon ke liye aupnyasik arthon kaa srijan shaamil hota he
 It is common for those novel meanings to diverge substantially from the standard meaning
 is prakaar 'kool' or 'hot' donon kaa matlab "bahut acha," "prabhaavshaalee," yaa "sundar" ho saktaa he
 Slang words are often known to be used only within a group or intergroup
 udhaaharan ke liye lit mul rup se keval kuch vishesh internet up-samskritiyon jaise ki pataakhon or online video gamers ke bich lokapriy the
 However, during the 1990s and in the early 21st century, lit has begun to take more and more common space on the Internet and has now spread beyond Internet-based dialogue and conversational languages
 kathboli ke anya prakaaron main shaamil hai mobile phone par istemaal hone vaali esemes kii bhashaa or "chatspea," ", jo "jor se hansane" yaa "joardaar hansee" yaa aroefel, "hansate-hansate jameen par lot janaa" kaa ek vipareet arth he), jiskaa istemaal internet par twarit samvaad bhejne ke liye vyapak rup se kiya jaataa he
 Some linguists make a distinction between the use of slang and the use of slang
 ghilad jukarman ke anusaar "kathboli kaa sandarbh ek vishisht saamaajik samooh, udhaaharan ke liye kishoron, sainikon, kaidiyon or choron dwaara istemaal kiye jane vaale anaupchaarik shabdic samagriyon se he
 Slang is not the kind of colloquial language that is an informal, easy dialect used by the speaker on some occasion; Which may include words such as "yours" and the use of other colloquial words
 The use of common colloquial is a lexical material used in informal dialect whereas in the broad sense "colloquial" terminology may include slang use, not in its narrow sense
 kathboli kaa prayog aksar bolchaal kii bhashaa main kiya jaataa he lekin sabhi bolchaal kii bhashaayen kathboli nahin hoti hai
 One way to do between slang and colloquial language is to ask if most local speakers understand the term; If they do, then it is a colloquial language
 haalanki samasya yah he ki yah ek alag, pramaathran pranali nahin he balki ek nirantarata kii pranali he
 However, most slang are short-lived and often used by newcomers, some of which achieve non-slang colloquial status as 'bliss, fortune' and the first name of a Jewish woman, Zelda) and even a formal position "
 kathboli ko kai bhashaaon main 'slang' kaha jaataa haibhashavaigyanikon ko is shabd kii jaden abhi gyaat nahin hai
 It is related to the khubhasa of thieves, and its earliest authentic use is "the vocabulary of inferior or non-eminent people, though other than that its origin is not clear

 He was also the chairman of the Bharati Parishad established by Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya
 gulabji aaajeevan apni moulik udbhaawanaaon se bharti ke bhandar ko samrudh karte rahe
 He set his goal - "smell in the air, be scattered like a hummus, do not see hamtu, we do not see the garden in the garden even if it is filled with fragrance, we cannot deny the contribution of Gulabji in the field of literature
 This contribution is of two types
 na sirf unhone utkrisht sahitya kii rachana hi kii he balki aanevaali pidiyon ke liye pagarhndiyaan bhi banaakar chodi hai
 He has been the first pioneer of many genres of poetry, which is briefly mentioned as follows - doha bahut purana chand he kintu aadhunik hindi main bihari jaise shringaar ke tathaa dingal kavi suryamall jaise viraras ke dohe sarvapratham gulabji ne hi prastut kiye
 ucch koti kii bhavapravanta tathaa bhashaa kaa kasaav tathaa pravaah kavi ke samarthy ke dyotak hai
 Gulabji used the sonnet form of English in Hindi for the first time in 1941
 anjaan logon ne trilochan shastri ko sonet ke pravartak kaa naam de diya
 kisi ne shastriji kii pustak khol kar dekhne kaa ksht bhi nahin kiya ki vah gulabji kii pustak ke kitne samay baad chhapi thi tathaa jinhen sonet kaha ja rahaa he ve sonet kii kasuti par khare utarate bhi hai yaa nahin
 sonet keval chand nahi, abhivyakti kii ek vidha he
 The poetry of only fourteen lines is not sonnet, the lines should be especially rhymed with rhyme and in the last two lines, the expression of expressions should also be there
 He was not a sonnet due to the lack of both these major traits in the poetry of Trilochan Shastri
 Gulabji had so impressed Sonnet that he was bewildered by the news of Gandhiji's death, and in two nights he composed 46 sonnets which were indelibly printed as 'gandhi-bharati'
 Although the Hindi name 'swanubhuti' given to his sonnet did not become popular, sonnet always remained a natural form of expression for him
 aajkal ve angrezi main kavita, od tathaa sonet likh rahe hai
 Gulabji first introduced Hindi Ghazals in 1971
 yon to ise hindi main dhaalane kaa prayaas kaafii samay se kiya ja rahaa tha
 But with the use of Urdu deaf in Hindi, Hindi does not become a ghazal, it was necessary to echo the symbol scheme of Hindi, bimb-vidhan and basic philosophy
 gulabji ne is santulan ko saadhaa tathaa hindi bhashaa ke saath urdu kii aatma ko bhi ghazal main utaara
 jis prakaar chhayavaadi kaviyon ne hindi-sahitya ko, nai padaavalee, abhivyakti ke naye aayam, bhaavon kii sookshmata di, usee prakaar gulabji ne bhi apni gazalon ke prayog se hindi main nai sambhaavnaaon kaa vistaar kiya
 Today Ghazal is a popular genre of Hindi and much of the credit goes to this silent seeker of Bharati
 gulabji dwaara likhi gazalon kii chaar main se teen pustaken uttar pradesh sarkaar se puraskrit huin
 is prakaar gulabji ne na keval hindi main ghazal likh kar sahitya ko samrudh kiya balki agle gazalakaaron kaa maarg bhi prashast kiya
 All the poetical poets wrote beautiful songs, but the chord of these songs covered by the shadowy faults like symmetrical word-structure and pneumaticity, ambiguity and lack of integration, could neither connect with the folk-mind nor by singing
 These literary songs could only be accepted as a genre of poetry
 Even medieval songs had to be used for singing
 isse utprerit hokar gulabji ne gey geeton kii parampara ko punah sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 His collection of devotional songs 'bhakti-ganga' and 'tilak Kare Raghubir' were inaugurated in 1997 by the works of Hon'ble President Shri Shankar Dayal Sharma
 in geeton kii bhashaa saral, bhav saghan tathaa darshan gahan he
 They have the ability to woo both special and normal people along with singularity
 sangeet main baddh hokar bahut se geeton ne gulabji ke prayog kii sarthakata ko pramanit kiya he
 In these three books, 'geet-brindavan', sita-banavas' and 'geet-ratnavali', Gulabji has tied the narrative of the narrative in lyrical songs in such a way that he is also on stage as geeti-natya or nritya-natya
 Can be presented
 is prakaar ye teenon pustaken prabandh bhi hai, muktak bhi; drishy hai tathaa shravy bhi, paathya hai tathaa gey bhi
 inke kai geet gaaye tathaa saraahe gayi he tathaa kai kaa manch par nrity ke saath prastutikaran bhi hua he
 In these songs, the characters of Krishna, Radha, Sita and Ratnavali are also shown in a new form
 ’bali-nirvaas’ mishra kavy athwa geeti-natya kaa viral udhaaharan he
 This has greatly influenced the subsequent literature
 ’dinakar’ kii ’urvashi’ se kaafii purv kii is rachana kaa apsara prasang drashtavy he
 Apart from these, successfully used the genres like Masnavi, Od, Shepherd, symbol-poetry etc
 ab prashn he ve sahitya kii kis dhara, kis pravriti kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai to lagbhag 70 varshon se kavita kii upasna karanevaale kavi se yah to aashaa nahin kii ja sakati ki vah keval ek prakaar kii hi kavita karegaa
 gulabji ke bhi hamen vibhinn rup dekhne ko milte hai
 He is a manager, so is a ghazalkar and lyricist; If there are masters in the verses of poetry, then they have equal rights in verses of poetry and haiku
 khemon main banti hui duniya main swatantracheta gulabji kabhi pravaah ke saath nahin chale, kabhi kisi gut yaa vaad kaa sahaara nahin liya
 He has always done innovative experiments and he is progressively in the true sense, always on the path of progress
 purti mishra ke anusaar, "1940 se ajtak kadachit hi koi aisa, hindi sahitya kaa pathak, sampadak yaa sameekshak hoga jisane adbhut sahitya-srashta shri gulab khandelwal kii charchaa yaa prashansa na kii ho
" acharya vishwanath singh ke shabdon main - "mahakavi gulab khandelwal, sahitya kii ajasr mandakini pravaahit karanevaale pratham koti ke sahityakaron kii pankti main agrani hai
 For the last six-seven decades, Gulabji has been glorifying the literary-cultural life of countries like Prayag, Delhi, Bombay, Kolkata, Madras, India, America and Canada etc
 with his saraswat-sadhana
 apni nicksarg-sahaj pratibha ke navonmesh se unhone kavy kii vividh vidhaon main naveen kshitijon kaa udghaatan kiya he
 Each of his books establishes a new genre in poetry
 prakruti or prem kii svachhnd bhavvyanjana ke geet hon yaa deshbhakti se anupranit shashakt or pravahpurn dohe or sonet, jivan kii maarmik anubhutiyon se nicksruth gazalen, rubaayiyaan or muktak hon athwa gambheer jivan-darshan kii vivruti karanevaale khandakavy, mahakavy or kavyanatak - sarvatra gulabji kii pratibha kavy ke naye ayaamon kaa anusandhan karti chalati he
 In the chanted Urdu-like genre of Ghazal, he has achieved poignant sensations within the circle of restraint and taste by introducing the accepted aesthetic sense of Hindi
 unka ’sau gulab khile’ hindi kii apni kahi jane yogya stareey gazalon kaa pehla sankalan he
 After this, he has brought the experiment to perfection by writing 365 ghazals in other creations like 'petals rose', 'some more roses', 'a fresh rose every morning'
 kishor jivan ke romantic saundaryabodh se yatra armbh karke jahaan unki sadhana shaashvat jivan-mulyon ke alokavrutt main kendrit hui he, vahiin unki kala ne chhayavaad kii sweekrut abhivyanjana pranali ko moulik bimb-vidhaan or vividh chand-prayogon se nayaa samarthy pradaan kiya he
 Gulabji is the most important poet of Hindi, after the poetism of Chhatism, with the idea of genius and prosperity of expression
 
 
 
 apane saahitiyik krititv se gulabji ne bihar, uttar-pradesh, bengal, rajasthan or sudur kerala main hi nahin videshon main bhi khyaati arjeet kii he
 His songs and ghazals, from Sudhi scholars, to ordinary literature-lovers, are being massacred by the public broadcast by Akashvani and propagated by intelligent musicians; The musical tone that accompanies the consonants of poetry in Gulabji's ghazals and the ease in his songs is a successful means of providing poetic audibility to today's readable, unreadable Hindi poetry
 uttarapradesh-sarkaar ne unki chah rachanaaon - ushaa, rup kii dhoop, sau gulab khile, kuch or gulab, har subah ek tazaa gulab or ahalya ko puraskrit karke kavi ke saath-saath sahitya-sadhana ko bhi sammanit kiya he
 
 
 
 In the last two decades, he has not only made various experiments of chandamukta composition, he has also edited the great work of reconnecting music with literature by creating a thousand songs in the stream of devotional songs of Tulsi, Sur, Meera
 iske atirikt gulabji ne ’geet-vrindavan’, ’sita-vanvaas’ tathaa ’geet-ratnavali’ jaise geeti-kaavyon kii rachana karke radha, sita or ratnavali ke jivan kii traasadee ko bhi naye pariprekshya main prastut kiya he
 His new work in the style of Urdu Masnavi written here, 'preet Na Kariyo Koy', adds a new dimension to Hindi poetry
 jahaan is rachana dwaara ve urdu ke pramukh masanvi-lekhak, mir hasan or dayashankar ’naseem’ kii shrenee main aa gayi hai vahiin apane bhakthigiton kii sudeergh shrinkhalaa dwaara unhone kabir, sur, tulsi or mira kii parampara main apana sthaan surakshit kara liya he
 " mahadevi verma ne ek baar afsos jataate huye kaha, "aapke saath hindiwaalon ne nyaay nahin kiya!" unke kavy-paath ko sunakar ve boleen, "mere aankhon ke sammukh ek-ek kar chitra aate ja rahe the
 "clearly his point was towards the imaginativeness of Gulabji's poetry

 See the following example- d y − y d x = 0 { \ displaystyle dy-ydx=0} kaa hal nikaalen
 Solution: This equation can be written as dyy = dx { \ displaystyle {dy \ over y} = {dx \ over}}, ∫ d y y = ∫ d x { \ displaystyle \ int {dy \ over y}= \ int {dx \ over }} ln | y | = ln | x + 1 | + c { \ displaystyle ln | y | = ln | x + 1 | + c} y = e l n | x + 1 | + c = e l n | x + 1 | 
 e c { \ displaystyle y=e^{ln|x+1|+c}=e^{ln|x+1|}
e^{c}} y = | 1 + x | ec = ± ec { \ displaystyle y = | 1 + x | e ^ {c} = \ pm e ^ {c}} yahan sankhya ± e c { \ displaystyle \ pm e^{c}} ko ek anya niyatank d likh sakate hai, or ab iskaa hal nimnlikhit rup main nirupit ho jaayegaa y = d { \ displaystyle y = D}

 According to Vayu Purana, Magha Mahatmya and Brihadharmapuran, in the east part, even in its secret place, the self-cultivation of sages continues today
 lomaharshan ke putr sauti ugrashrava ne yaheen rishiyon ko puranic kathaayen sunaayi thim
 According to the Varaha Purana, it is called 'naimisharanya' due to the destruction of demons by God in the blink of God
 vaayu, kurm aadi puraanon ke anusaar bhagwaan ke manomay chakra kii nemi yaheen visheern hui thi, atev yah naimisharany kahalaaya
 The derivation of 'naimish' is said to be from the word 'nimish', as Gaurmukh killed an army of asuras in a blasphemy
 ek anya anushruti ke anusaar is sthaan par adhik maatra main paae janevaale fal nimish ke kaaran iskaa naam naimish padaa
 Regarding the derivation, there is a third view that on the occasion of the demonization of Asuras, the cycle of Vishnu fell in Naimish
 kintu duusare aakhyaan ke anusaar jab devataaon kaa dal mahadev ke netritv main brahma ke pas asuron ke aatank se peedit hokar pahunchaa, to brahma ne apana chakra choda or unhen vah sthaan tapasya ke liye nirdeshit kiya jahaan chakra gire

 The Pushpika mentions that Luv and Kush sang the poetry of Valmiki in seven days in Rama's Ashwamedha Yagna on the banks of the river Gomti
 maharishi shaunak ke man main dirghakaal tak gyaan satr karne kii ichha thi
 Pleased with his worship, Brahmaji gave him a circle and said- 'go on driving it

 araju internet movie database par Interest is a charge that is levied for a property borrowed
 yah udhaar liye gaye paise ke liye adaa kii gayi keemat he, yaa, jamaa dhan se arjeet kiya gaya paisa he
 Assets that are lent with interest include money, shares, consumer goods by purchase on rent, major assets such as aircraft and sometimes the entire factory given on finance lease arrangements
 Interest is calculated on the value of assets in the same way as on money
 byaaj ko "paise ke kiraye" ke rup main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 When the money is deposited in a bank, the depositor is usually paid interest at one percent of the deposited amount; When money is borrowed, interest is usually paid to the lender at one percent of the outstanding balance
 mul dhan kaa pratishat jo ek shulk ke rup main ek nishchit avadhi main adaa kiya jaataa he, use byaaj dar kehete hai
 Interest is a compensation to the lender that is given to him, a) for the risk of principal money which is called loan risk; And b) to exclude other useful investments that could have been made by the lent property
 yah chode gaye nivesh avasar laagat ke naam se jane jate hai
 Instead of using the property directly by the lender himself, it is given to the borrower

 In economics, interest is considered the value of debt
 bible kaal ke pracheen israel main, nijee rin par byaaj lagaana moses ke kanoon ke khilaaf tha
 During the Middle Ages, time was considered to be the property of God
 isliye, byaaj kii maang karne ko parameshwar kii sampatti ke saath vyapaar karne jaisaa mana jaataa tha
 Furthermore, St
 Thomas Aquinas, who was the head Theologian of the Catholic Church, argued that it is wrong to demand an interest because it is equivalent to a "double charge" because it carries a charge for both the object and its use

 madhyayugin arthvyavastha main rin puri tarah se aavashyaktaaon kaa parinaam hua karata tha or, in paristhitiyon main, byaaj lene ko naitik rup se bura mana jaataa tha
 It was also considered morally questionable, because no goods were produced by lending money and therefore should not be compensated, unlike other activities that had direct physical consequences, such as blacksmithing or farming

 Thus the Jews became a vanguard of a vicious circle
 bible ke niyamon ke aadhaar par isai byaaj lene kii puri tarah se ninda karte the or 1179 se aisa karne waalon ko bahishkrut kar diya jaataa tha
 Catholic arbitrary rulers often placed the harshest financial burden on the Jews
 yahudiyon ne pratikriya swaroop ek aise vyapaar ko apanaaya jisamen isai kanoon vastav main unke khilaaf pakshpaat karata tha or unhone rin dene ke ghrunit vyapaar main apni pahchaan bana lee
 Interest in Islamic civilization is also often considered to be bad for the same reasons that usury is prohibited by the Catholic Church, most scholars agree that the Quran explicitly forbids seeking interest

 Ultimately, and perhaps most fundamentally, money itself was seen as a commodity and the use of one's money as something for which it should benefit from interest

 Under this principle, interest is the payment for the period during which the lender is deprived of its funds
 aarthik drushti se, mul dhan ke mulya ko byaaj dar kehete hai or yah dhan aapurti ke aapurti or maang niyamon par aadhaarit hoti he
 The first attempt to control the interest rate through manipulation of the money supply was made in 1847 by the French Central Bank

 As such a fee is mathematically similar to levying an interest, the difference between "interest-free" banking and "interest-for-interest" banking is almost the same thing
 saadhaaran byaaj kii gananaa keval mul raashi par, yaa mooldhan ke us bhaag par jise abhi tak adaa nahin kiya gaya ho kii jaati he
 The amount of simple interest is calculated according to the following formula: jahaan r byaaj dar avadhi he B0 praarambhik shesh raashi he or m paar ho chuki samyavadhi kii sankhya he
 To calculate the period interest rate r, the person divides the interest rate by / period number m
 udhaaharan ke liye, kalpana karen ki ek credit card dharak ke paas 2500 dollar kaa bakaayaa jamaa he or prati varsh saadhaaran byaaj dar 12
99% he
 At the end of 3 months, the added interest will be or use shesh raashi kaa purna bhugtan karne ke liye is samay 2581
19 dollar dena hoga
 If instead he only pays interest, then the payment period will be the amount of interest paid for each of those three months according to the rate r, 3 maheene ke ant main uski shesh raashi phir bhi 2500 dollar hi hogi
 In this case, time value of money is not counted as a factor
 Fixed payments have additional costs that need to be kept in mind when comparing loans
 udhaaharan ke liye, die gaye 100 dollar kii mul raashi: There are two complications involved when comparing offers of different interest
 ek bank khaataa jo keval saadhaaran byaaj pradaan karata he, usase nirbaadh rup se paise nikaalnaa sambhavit nahin hota, kyonki usase paise nikalnaa or phir turant jamaa karnaa laabhprad hota he
 Compound interest is similar to simple interest, but over time their difference becomes much deeper
 yah antar isliye he kyonki bakaayaa byaaj ko dey bakaayaa raashi main joda jaataa he
 If introduced in another way, the borrower is charged interest on the previous interest
 yah maanate hue ki mul dhan yaa baad ke byaaj kaa kii kisi bhi hisse kaa bhugtan nahin kiya gaya he, rin nimnlikhit formulon dwaara pariklit kiya jaataa he: Where Icomp is compound interest, B0 is the initial outstanding balance, Bm is the outstanding balance after m period and r is the rate rate
 udhaaharan ke liye, agar uparokt credit card dharak koi bhi bhugtan nahin karne kaa chunaav karata he, byaaj jamaa hota rahegaa So, at the end of 3 months the credit card holder will have the outstanding balance of $ 2582
07 and now he has to pay $ 82

 sankshipt samay avadhi main saadhaaran byaaj lagbhag chakravriddhi byaaj ke jaisaa hi hota he, isliye niyamit bhugtan chukauti kii sabase kam mahangi ranneeti hoti hai
 One problem with compound interest is that it is difficult to explain the resulting liability

 However, in lending, the interest rate is often quoted as a nominal interest rate
 rin main aksar vibhinn gaiyr byaaj shulk or fees bhi shaamil hoti he
 An example is the point on mortgage loans in the United States
 When such fees exist, lenders are required to regularly provide information about the 'real' value of finance, often expressed as an annual percentage rate
 APR ek rin kii kul laagat ko atirikt shulk or kharchon ko jodne ke baad ek byaaj dar ke rup main vyakt karne kaa prayaas karti he, haalanki vivaran adhikaar kshetra ke anusaar bhinn ho sakate hai
 In economics, continuous compounding is often used because of mathematical properties
 vanijyik rin aamtaur par saadhaaran byaaj kaa prayog karte hai, lekin yah jaruri nahin he ki rin avadhi kii samaapti tak unpar hameshaa ekal byaaj dar hi lagu ho
 a loan for which the interest rate does not change is called a fixed rate loan
 rin kii avadhi ke dauraan rin par asthir dar ho saktaa he jo kisi sandarbh dar par aadhaarit hota he, aamtaur par ek sthir margin se adhik 
 inhen asthir dar, char dar yaa samyojya dar ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 a combination of fixed rate and floating rate loans is possible and often used
 rin kii avadhi ke dauraan rinon main vibhinn byaaj dar bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he, jahaan byaaj dar main badlaav ek antarnihit byaaj dar ke alaava anya vishisht maapdandon ke aadhaar par niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 For example a loan that uses a specific time period to specify a specific change in rates, such as a rate of 5% in the first year, a rate of 6% in the second year, a rate of 7% in the third year
 
 arthshaastra main, byaaj ko rin kaa mulya mana jaataa he, isliye, yah bhi mudrasphiti ke kaaran vikrutiyon ke adheen hota he
 The nominal interest rate is what the consumer sees, which refers to the price before adjusting for inflation
 maamuli byaaj anya karkon ke bich vaastavik byaaj dar jamaa mudrasphiti, se bana hua he
 a simple formula for a minor interest is: i = r + π { \ displaystyle i=r+ \ pi } Where i is the nominal interest, r is the real interest and π { \ displaystyle \ pi} is inflation
 yah formula byaaj ke mulya ko sthir kray shakti ke ikaayiyon main maapne kaa prayaas karata he
 However, if this statement is true, it will have at least two fallacious assumptions
 pehla, ki ek kshetra ke bheetar sabhi byaaj daren jo ki ek hi mudrasphiti ko saajha karti hai ek hi hona chahie
 Secondly, that lenders know the inflation of the period during which they lend
 kosh band arjeet karne vaale byaajon or bandhak rin arjeet karne vaale byaajon main asamanta kaa ek kaaran he vah jokhim jo ek rindaata ek aarthik agent ko rin dene ke kaaran uthaata he
 In this particular case, an individual citizen is more likely to pay a government
 isliye, ek vyaktigat naagarik par prabharee byaaj shulk kii dar sarkaar ke liye lagaae gaye byaaj shulk kii dar se adhik hota he
 To consider the above mentioned information asymmetry, both the value of inflation and the real value of money are converted to their expected value, resulting in the following equation: i t = r + π + σ { \ displaystyle i_{t}=r_{}+ \ pi _{}+ \ sigma } Here, it { \ displaystyle i_ {t}} was the minimum interest at the time of the loan, r { \ displaystyle r_ {}} is the actual interest expected during the term of the loan, π { \ displaystyle \ pi _ {}} inflation
 Is what is expected during the loan period and σ { \ displaystyle \ sigma} is the representative value for the risk engaged in operations

 yah 'prati varsh' ke niyam kii andekhi karata he or prayek bhugtan tithi main dharna banaata he
 It is typically used to compare two long-term opportunities
 apwaad: Rule of Flat Rate Loans and 78s: Some consumer loans are structured as flat rate loans, wherein the outstanding loan is determined by allocating the total interest throughout the term of the loan, including the "rule of 78s" or This is done using the "some of Digits" method
 1 se lekar 12 sankhya kaa samaveshi yoga athhattar he
 This practice enabled quick calculation of interest in the days before the invention of computers
 ek rin jisamen 78s ke niyam ke anusaar byaaj pariklit kiya jaataa he, usamen rin ke jivan kaal par kul byaaj kii yaa to saadhaaran yaa chakravriddhi byaaj ke rup main gananaa kii jaati he or yah uparokt vidhiyon main se kisi ek ke baraabar hota he
 Payment remains constant during the life of the loan; But payments are allocated to progressively smaller amounts of interest
 ek saal ke rin main, pehle maheene main, rin ke jivan kaal ke dauraan sabhi bakaayaa byaaj kaa 12 / 78 bakaayaa hota he; duusare maheene main, 11 / 78; or barahawein maheene tak chal kar sabhi byaajon kaa keval 1 / 78 hi bakaayaa rahata he
 The practical effect of the rule of 78s is that prepayment became more expensive at the time of repayment of term loans
 ek varsh ke rin ke liye, sabhi dey bhugtanon kaa lagbhag 3 / 4 chathe maheene tak ekatra kar liya jaataa he or tab mul raashi kaa purna bhugtan prabhavi byaaj dar ko AYP se kahin adhik kar detaa he jo bhugtan kii gananaa karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In 1992, the United States prohibited the use of the "rule of 78s" interest in connection with mortgage refinancing and other consumer loans with a tenure of more than five years
 kuch anya nyaayalayon ne bhi kuch prakaar ke rinon main vishesh kar upabhokta rin main, 78s ke niyam ke prayog ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya he
 Rule of 72: The "rule of 72" is a "quick and dirty" method of finding out how quickly money doubles at a given interest rate
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi tumhaare paas 6% kii byaaj dar he, tab 6% par sanyojit hokar tumhaare paise ko doguna hone ke liye 72 / 6 yaa 12 saal kaa samay lagegaa
 It is an approximation that breaks down when it is greater than 10%
 nivesh nirdhaarit byaaj dar ke liye bazaar hai 
 prayek vishisht rin apni byaaj dar nirdhaarit karne main nimnlikhit karkon kaa dhyaan rakhata he: This includes all uses in which that money could have been appropriated, including lending to others, investing elsewhere, holding cash, and simply spending money
 chunki rindaata apni khapat ko asthgit karata jaataa he, vah kam se kam yah chahega ki jo dhan vah vasuul karata he vah mudrasphiti ke kaaran vastuon kii badi hui keemton ke liye paryaapt ho
 Since future inflation is unknown, here are three strategies
 yahaan hameshaa hi udhaarkarta ke diwalia ho jane, faraar ho jane yaa anyathaa rin par difolt karne kaa jokhim bana rahata he
 The risk premium seeks to measure the integrity of the borrower, the risk in the success of his enterprise, and the security of any collateral that has been pledged
 udhaaharan ke liye, vikasshil deshon ko die gaye rinon america sarkaar kii tulana main adhik ucch jokhim premium shaamil hota he jo unke udhaar paatrata main antar ke kaaran hota he
 The rate of operating credit limit of a business will be higher than the rate of a mortgage loan
 kaarobaar kii udhaar paatrata ko bound reating services ke dwaara mapa jaataa he or vyaktigat ke credit score ko beuro credit dwaara mapa jaataa he
 It is possible to change the standard of risk of a person's debt in a big way
 rindaata apane adhiktam jokhim ko surakshit karnaa chahega, lekin karj ke sanvibhag vaale udhaardaata jokhim premium ko kam kar sakate hai taaki keval sabase sambhavit parinaam kii raksha kii ja sake
 Default interest is an interest that a borrower pays in the event the loan contract is not completed
 difolt byaaj aamtaur par mul byaaj ke mukaable kaaphi adhik hota he kyonki yah udhaarkarta kii vittiya jokhim main apvriddhi ko darshata he
 Default interest provides compensation to the lender for additional risk
 bank, rin samjhauton ko vibhinn paridrishyon ke bich alag karne ke liye difolt byaaj ko jodta he
 Only by seeking interest equal to inflation will the lender's purchasing power remain the same, but he will prefer his own consumption sooner than later
 deree ke liye ek byaaj premium hoga
 He would not want to consume, but would instead invest in another product
 pratispardhaa nivesh main jo sambhav pratifal vah praapt kar saktaa he vah usapar prabharee byaaj ko nirdhaarit karata he
 There is less risk of default and inflation in short periods as it is easier to predict in the near future
 mote taur par kaha jaae to, yadi byaaj daron main vruddhi hoti he, to rin kii ucch keemton ke kaaran nivesh kam ho jaataa he
 Interest rates are generally determined by the market, but government intervention - usually by the central bank - has a profound effect on the short-term interest rate and is used as a key tool of monetary policy
 central bank icchit dar par dhan kii kharid yaa bech kaa prastaav pesh karti he or kuch upkarnon par apane niyantran kii vajah se ve kul bazaar byaaj daron ko prabhavit kar sakate hai
