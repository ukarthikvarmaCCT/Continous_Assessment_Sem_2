 Not all the Sunni Muslim jurisprudence scholars Ibn Majah's mutaluk agree
 vishesh rup se, maliki or ebn al-athir jaise al-mavattaah ko chhathi pustak maanate hai 
 The reason for linking Ibn Majah to Sunan is that it contains many hadiths that do not figure in the other five, while all the hadiths of Muvatta are included in other Sahih books

 From the very ancient times to the present times it is the second most fundamental of the fundamental principles of that religion
 'avatar' kaa shabdik arth he - bhagwaan kaa apni swatantray shakti ke dwaara bhautik jagat main murtarup se aavirbhaav hona, prakat hona
 The oldest word signifying the 'avatar' element is 'prudravabha'
 shrimadbhagwat main 'vyakti' shabd isi arth main prayukt hua he
 
 vaishnav dharm main avatar kaa tathy vishesh rup se mahatvashaalee mana jaataa he, kyonki vishnu ke par, vyuh, vibhav, antaryami tathaa archa naamak pancharupadhaaran kaa siddhant pancharaatr kaa moulik tatv he
 That is why Vaishnavajan worship these different forms of God mostly according to their interest and love

 But the worship of the original form of Lord Shankar and Bhagwati Parvati is prevalent everywhere in this opinion

 God, the protector of creation, is always present in the order of this balance
 'rut' ke sthaan par 'anrut' kii, dharm ke sthaan par adharm kii jab kabhi prabalata hoti he, tab bhagwaan kaa avatar hota he
 The sage's emanation, destruction of the wicked, destruction of unrighteousness and establishment of religion are called god incarnations for the fulfillment of this important purpose
 gita kaa yah shloke avatharavaad kaa mahaamantra mana jaataa he : But these purposes are also considered secondary to the avatar
 avatar kaa mukhya prayojan isse sarvatha bhinn he
 For all the Gods who are omniscient, guiltless, regulator of rituals and rituals, the work of wickedness and decorum can also be proved by other means, then the main purpose of incarnation of God is something else according to Srimad Bhagwat: maanvon ko saadhan nirpeksh mukti kaa daan hi bhagwaan ke prakatya kaa jaagruk prayojan he
 God automatically grants salvation to his leelavilas, with his grace, without expecting any spiritual practice to the seekers - this is the fundamental and prime objective of the avatar
 puraanon main avatharavaad kaa ham vistrut tathaa vyapak varnan pate hai
 For this reason, assuming the origin of this element is not justified by the Puranas
 vedon main hamen avatharavaad kaa moulik tathaa pracheenatam aadhaar uplabdh hota he
 According to the Vedas, Prajapati wore various forms for the protection of the living beings and for the welfare of the universe

 In the Rigveda, Trivikram Vishnu has been largely credited with measuring the entire world by three dagas
 aage chalakar prajapati ke sthaan par jab vishnu main is prakaar avtaron ke rup, lila tathaa ghatnavaichitraya kaa varnan veda ke upar hi bahush: ashrith he
 According to Bhagwat, the incarnations of satavanidhi hari cannot be counted
 jis prakaar na sookhanevaale talab se hajaaron choti choti nadiyaan nikalati hai, usee prakaar aksharyy satwashray hari se bhi naanaa avatar utpann hote hai-avtara hasankhyeya hare: satvanidhedvija:
 As vidasasin: kulya: saras: sau: sahasrash:
 pancharaatr mat main avatar pradhanat: chaar prakaar ke hote hai-vyuh, vibhav, antaryami tathaa aryavataar
 The number of incarnations of Vishnu is believed to be 24, but Dashavatara's imagination is extremely popular, whose famous noun is as follows - two water creatures, two aquatics, Vamana, three Rama, Buddha and Kalki - mahabharat main dashavathar main 'buddha' ko chhod diya gaya he or 'hans' ko avatar maanakar sankhya kii purti kii gai he
 According to Bhagwat, 'balarama' is counted in Dashavatara, because Shri Krishna himself was a god
 ve avatar nahin, avtari hai; ansh nahin, anshi hai
 According to Srimad Bhagwat, Parmeshwar acts as the regulator of nature and naturalistic work and, despite being free from Maya, seems to be associated with Maya and is always irritated and is called Purush with the expression of different incarnations
 is prakaar avtaron ke bhed hai--purushavatar, gunavatar, kalpavataar, manwantravatr, yugavatar, swlpavataar, leelavataradi
 Somewhere discussion of charge is also found, such as Parashurama
 is prakaar avtaron kii sankhya tathaa sangya main paryaapt vikaas hua he
 On the basis of the above discussion, it can be said that the incarnation is actually the manifestation of God in which he descends into the realms of a particular purpose, in a particular country and time
 buddha dharm ke mahayanapanth main avatar kii kalpana drudh mul he
 'bodhisattva' incarnates as a Buddha on completion of the Karmapha and after the attainment of Nirvana, Buddha also incarnates in the future
 bodhisattva tushit naamak swarg main nivas karte hue apane karmfal kii paripakvata kii pratiksha karte hai or uchit avasar aane par vah maanav jagat main avateern hote hai
 The Theravists do not have this belief
 buddha avataratv kaa purna nidarshan hamen tibet main dalailama kii kalpana main uplabdh hota he
 The Dalai Lama Avalokiteshvara is considered an incarnation of Buddha in Tibet
 tibeti parampara ke anusaar greydain drup naamak lamas ne is kalpana kaa pratham pradurbhaav kiya jiske anusaar dalailama dharmik guru tathaa raja ke rup main pratishthit kiye gaye
 Historically, a lama named lojung-gya-matso gave birth to this tradition
 tibeti logon kaa drudh vishwaas he ki dalailama ke marane par unki aatma kisi balak main pravesh karti he jo us math ke aasapaas hi janm letaa he
 The avatar's imagination was not valid in this
 chini logon kaa pehla raja shangti sadachaar or sadgun kaa adarsh mana jaataa tha, parantu uske upar devatv kaa aarope kahin bhi nahin miltaa
 Many principles in Parsi religion are similar to Hindus and especially Vedic Aryans, but the imagery of avatar is not available here
 parsi dharmanuayiyon kaa kathan he ki is dharm ke praudh prachaarak yaa pratishthapak zarathustra ahurmajd ke kahin bhi avatar nahin maane gaye hai
 However, these people considered the king to be holy and endowed with divine power
 'hrenarah' naamak adbhoot tej kii satta maanya thi, jiskaap nivas peeche ardshir raja main tathaa sasnavanshi raajaaon main tha, aisi kalpana parsi granthon main bahush: uplabdh he
 The imagery of avatarism exists even in the Sami people
 in logon main raja bhautik shakti kaa jis prakaar chudaant nivas tha usee prakaar vah daivi shakti kaa purna pratik mana jaataa tha
 Therefore, considering the king as an incarnation of the deity was considered a naturally proven principle here
 pracheen babul main hamen is manyata kaa purna vikaas dikhaai detaa he
 Urmush, the king of Kish, was considered an incarnation of God during his lifetime
 naramsin naamak raja apane main devtaa kaa rakt pravaahit manaat tha isliye usne apane mastak par sing se yukt chitra ankit karvaa rakhaa tha
 He was particularly well known as the 'god of Akkad'
 misri manyata bhi kuch aisi hi thi
 The king there was known as 'faraun', whom the Egyptians believed to be endowed with divine power
 misranivasee yah bhi maanate the ki 'raa' naamak devtaa rani ke saath sahavaas kar raajputr ko utpann karata he, isiilie vah alokik shaktisampann hota he
 Jews are also in favor of being considered incarnations of God
 bible main spashtat: ullekh he ki ishwar hi manushya kaa rup dhaaran karata he or iske paryaapt udhaaharan bhi vahaan uplabdh hote hai
 Among the Greeks, the avatar was not imagined as that of the Aryans, but the brave men were considered the sons of various gods
 prakhyat yoddha harkulies jeus kaa putr mana jaataa tha, lekin devtaa ke manurup main prithvi par janm lene kii baat yunaan main maanya nahin thi
 The Shia sect of Islam preaches the same doctrine as the Avatar
 shiya logon kii yah manyata ki ali tathaa fatima ke vanshajon main hi dharmaguru banane kii yogyata vidyaman he, avatar ke paas tak pahunchati he
 This fact can also be known in the imagination of 'ima'
 ve mohammad sahab ke vanshaj hi nahin, praytut unamem divya jyonti kii bhi satta he or unki shreshthata kaa yahi kaaran he
 The basic belief is that God descended into Jesus with the purpose of making atonement for the sins of mankind and to show man the means of salvation
 bible ke nirikshan se pataa chalata he ki kis prakaar isa ke shishy unke jeevankaal main hi dhire-dhire unke ishwartv par vishwaas karne lage
 History testifies that after the death of Jesus, from the beginning of Christianity, Jesus has been considered fully God and fully human
 is praarambhik avatharavaadi vishwaas ke susreekaran main uttarottar spashtataa aati gai he
 In fact, the representation of avatarism evolved from opposition to various misconceptions
 us vikaas ke sopan nimnlikhit hai: The Bible does not find a systematic rendition of avatarism, yet it contains the fundamental elements of Christian avatarism
 ek ore, isa kaa vaastavik manushya ke rup main chithran hua he-unka janm or bachapan, tees varsh kii umr tak badhai kii jeevika, du:khayog or maran, yah sab aise shabdon main varnit he ki pathak ke man main isa ke manushya hone ke vishay main andeh nahin rah jaataa
 On the other hand, Jesus is also depicted as an incarnation of God
 tatsambandhi shiksha samajhane ke liye ishwar ke swaroop ke vishay main bible kii dharna kaa parichay aavashyak he
 According to this, there are three persons in the same God, in the same God-element, father, son and soul; The three are equally eternal and infinite
 bible main iskaa anek sthalon par spasht shabdon main ullekh hua he ki isa ishwar ke putr hai, jo pita kii bhaanti purna rup se ishwariya he
 In the first three centuries no significant movement arose against this Biblical avatarism
 anek bhrant dharanaon kaa pravartan avashya hua tha, kintu unamem se koi bhi dhaaran aadhik samay tak prachlit nahin rah saki
 Two conflicting promises were made in the first century — Jesus was not God according to Abionitism and according to Docetism he was not human
 dosethism kaa arth he pratiyamanavaad, kyonki is vaad ke anusaar isa manushya ke rup main dikhaai to pade, kintu unki maanavtaa vaastavik ne hokar pratiyaman maatr thi
 In opposition to the above views, Catholic theologians used to cite biblical evidence that according to the true belief of Christianity, both God and manhood existed in Jesus
 chauthi shatabdi i
 main ariyas ne tritv or avatharavaad ke vishay main ek nayaa mat prachlit karne kaa safal prayaas kiya jisase bahut samay tak samast isai sansar main ashaanti vyaapt rahi
 According to Arius, the son of God incarnated in Jesus, but the son is not the divine but the creation of the father
 is shiksha ke virodh main isai giraje kii pratham mahasabha ne ghoshit kiya-pita or putr tatvat: ek hai arthath donon samaan rup se ishwar hai
 This Mahasabha was organized in 325 AD in a city called Niseya
 ariyas ke baad apolinaaris ne isa ke apurna manushyatv kaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya
 According to him, Jesus had a human body and a living creature, but he did not have an intelligent soul; The son of God took the place of the human soul
 kustutuniya kii mahasabha ne 381 i
 main apolinaras ke viruddh ghoshit kiya ki isa ke vaastavik maanav sharir main ek buddhisampann vaastavik maanviya aatma vidyaman thi
 In the fifth century, Bishop Nestorius of Kustuntunia preached a new notion of incarnation, which led to the third General Assembly of the Catholic Church held in Ephesus in 431 AD
 nestorius ke anusaar isa main do vyakti vidyaman the-ek maanav vyakti tha or ek ishwariya vyakti, jo ishwariya swabhaav se sampann tha
 Therefore, God did not become a human being, but he resided in a self-fulfilling human being
 effesus kii mahasabha ne nestorius ko padchyut kiya tathaa unki shiksha ke virodh main ghoshit kiya ki isa main keval ek hi vyakti arthath ishwar kaa putr vidyaman he
 Endowed with divine nature from time immemorial, the son of God embraced human nature, thus combining both divinity and manhood in one person
 nestorius ke mat ke pratikriyaswaroop kuch vidwaanon ne isa main na keval ek hi vyakti pratyut ek hi swabhaav bhi maan liya he
 The suit is named Monophysitism, namely, an autism; Utikase is considered to be its promoter
 is vaad ke anusaar avatarit hone ke pashchaat isa kaa ishwartv tathaa manushyatv donon is prakaar ek ho gaye ki ek nayaa swabhaav, ek naveen tatv utpann hua, jo na purna rup se ishwariya or na purnroop se maanviya tha
 According to others, the humanity of Jesus became completely absorbed in his divinity, leaving only the divine nature in Jesus
 is ekaswabhaavvaad ke viruddh chaturth mahasabha ne paramparaagat avatharavaad kii purna raksha karte hue tehraaya ki isa main ishwartv or manushyatv donon akshunn or pruthak hai
 Later a changed form of naturalism emerged
 yah nayaa vaad isa kaa ishwartv tathaa manushyatv donon ko sweekaar karte hue bhi maanata tha ki unka manushya purnataya niskriy tha, yahan tak ki usamen maanviya ichhashakti kaa bhi abhaav tha
 All of Jesus' work was inspired by his divine will
 is mat ke virodh main kustutuniya kii ek nai mahasabha ne 680 i
 isa kaa purna manushyatv pratipaadit karte hue ghoshit kiya ki isa main ishwariya ichhashakti tathaa kaaryaklap ke atirikt ek maanviya ichchhashakti tathaa kaaryaklap kaa pruthak astitv tha
 Thus we see that its theoretical formulation continued to develop for centuries, while fully protecting the early Avatarist faith
 antatogatva yah mana gaya ki ishwar ke putr ne purnataya ishwar rahete hue manushyatv apana liya he, at: ek hi ishwariya vyakti main do swabhaavon kaa-ishwartv or manushyatv kaa sanyog hua
 His manhood was real and complete - on the one hand his body and his grief were real, on the other hand his human soul had a separate existence and activity of his intellect and will
 isai avatharavaad kii praaia: incarnation' kaha jaataa he; vastav main yah ishwar dwaara manushyatv kaa grahan hi he

 Thomas Bolin, the first Earl of Wiltshire and his wife Elizabeth Bolin, daughter of the Countess of Wiltshire, was educated in the Netherlands and France, mainly as a bride of Claude of France
 She returned to England in early 1522 to marry her cousin, James Butler, the ninth Earl of Ormond, but the marriage plan failed and the Queen's Princess Catherine of Aragon received the title of bridegroom in the court
 1525 main, henry ashtum eni par aasakt ho gaye or usase pranay nivedan shuru ho gaya
 He resisted all her efforts and refused to be her mistress like her sister Mary Bolin
 Soon the tune of canceling his marriage to Queen Catherine rode on Henry so that he would be free to marry Anne
 When it became clear that Pope Clement VII would not cancel the marriage, the authority of the Catholic Church in England began to crumble

 Henry and Anne married on 25 January 1533
 On 23 May 1533 Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage invalid, and five days later Henry and Anne's marriage was declared valid
 Shortly afterwards, the Pope ordered a boycott sentence against Cranmer and Henry
 This marriage and boycott resulted in the first separation between the Church of England and Rome, and the Church of England was brought under the King's control

 On 7 September she gave birth to future Elizabeth i of England

 The academic debate about Anne's date of birth focuses on two main dates: 1501 and 1507
 Eric Ives, a British historian and legal expert, advocates the date 1501, while Retha Warnik, an American scholar who also wrote Anne's biography Hai has 1507 likes

 This meant that he had been living a sinful life with Catherine of Aragon all these years, though Catherine strongly opposed it and refused to believe that her first marriage was completed by physical relationships
 iskaa yah bhi matlab hua ki unki beti mairi avaidh thi or ki nae pope ko pichley pope kii galati sweekaar kerani chahie or uski shaadi ko amaanya qaraar de

 There is anecdotal evidence by her former hostess Anne Gainsford concerning biographer George White that Anne drew Henry's attention to a heretic pamphlet, perhaps Tindall's "the Obedience of the Christian Man" or Simon Fish's "supplication for Beggars" In which the kings were called by the kings to check the excesses of the Catholic Church

 Wulsey even held a church court in England that included a special envoy of the pope himself to decide the matter
 lekin pope ne kabhi apane dipti ko koi bhi nirnay lene kaa adhikaar nahin diya tha
 The Pope was still hostage to Charles v and Charles v was the faithful nephew of Henry's Queen Catherine
 pope ne england main nahin balki rome main koi faisalaa na hone tak henry ko nai shaadi karne se manaa kar diya

 However, public support remained with Queen Catherine
 On one evening of autumn in 1531, a mob of angry and violent women nearly surrounded Anne while eating at a zamindari's house on the River Thames
 eni kisi tarah naav se batch nikali
 When Archbishop William Warham of Canterbury died in 1532, the clergy of the Bolin family, Thomas Cranmer, was appointed with the permission of the Pope
 england main rome kii satta dhire-dhire tuutane lagi jo iskaa pratik thi ki rome se alag hone ke henry ke prayaas apni nai premika ko rijhaane kii tarang main nahin kiye gaye the
 In 1532 Thomas Cromwell introduced several acts before Parliament, including prayer against the general and the subordination of the clergy that recognized imperial supremacy over the Church and thus finalized secession with Rome
 in krityon ke baad, cromwel ko henry ke mukhya mantri ke rup main chhodte hue thomas mor ne chancelar ke pad se istifa de diya
 Anne Bolin often acted independently of her future husband, gave petitions, welcomed diplomats, presided over patronage meetings and foreign policy
 milan ke rajdoot ne 1531 main likhaa ki yadi koi angrezi sarkaar ko prabhavit karnaa chahta tha to uskaa anumodan jaruri tha, pehle 1529 main ek francisi rajdoot ne bhi yahi mat pesh kiya tha
 During this period, Anne Bolin actually played an important role in England's international position, strengthening the alliance with France

 Anne and Henry attended a meeting with the French king at Calais in the winter of 1532 in which Henry hoped to gain the support of Francis i of France for his marriage
 henry ne apni bhavi patni ko ek uchit upadhi di
 On 1 September 1532 she was made the Marques of Pembroke and became the most eminent non-royal woman of her realm
 The Pembroke title was important to the Tudor family because Henry's patron, Jasper Tudor, received the title of Earl of Pembroke, and Henry himself conducted the consecration

 Now events started increasing rapidly
 On 23 May 1533 Cranmer sat in a special court convened at Dunstable Priory to settle the legality of the king's marriage to Catherine of Aragon
 She declared Henry and Catherine's marriage invalid
 paanch din baad, 28 may 1533 ko cranmar ne henry or eni kii shaadi ko sahi or vaid ghoshit kar diya
 Catherine was formally stripped of her Queen's title and Anne was crowned Queen's Wife on 1 June 1533 at Westminster Abbey in a glittering ceremony followed by a splendid banquet
 vah england kii antim rani patni thi jise uske pati se alag taj pahanaaya gaya tha
 The day before that, Anne took part in a decorated procession in the streets of London in which she sat in a palanquin resting on two horses covered with white damask touching the ground "in white robes of gold" while the feudatories of the Chinkyu Portas had gold on her head
 Put a canopy of cloth
 parampara ke anusaar, usne safed kapade pahane the or uske sir par ek sone kaa shirobandh tha jiske neeche se uske lambey kaale bal khule latak rahe the
 The public's reaction to his presence was not very enthusiastic
 kisi bhi anya rani patni ke vipareet, eni ko saint edward kaa taj pahanaaya gaya tha jo pehle keval raaj kar rahe raja ko pehanaane ke liye istemaal kiya gaya tha
 Hunt suggests that this was done because by then Anne's pregnancy had begun to appear and that he had an heir in her stomach and it was assumed that he would be a boy

 Now Henry required that his subjects take an oath attached to the First Succession Act which effectively rejected the Pope's authority in legal matters and recognized Anne Bolin as queen

 The baby princess was brilliantly named, but Anne feared that Catherine's daughter, Mary from whom the title of Princess was now taken and labeled illegitimate, was a threat to Elizabeth's status

 After Christmas of 1534, Henry was discussing the possibility of leaving Anne without returning to Katherine with a dead child or miscarriage after an abortion

 Anne Bolin presided over a magnificent court
 She would spend open-mouthed gowns, gems, hairstyle ornaments, ostrich-feather fans, riding equipment, furniture and furnishings to maintain the lavish display required by her level
 Many palaces were rebuilt according to his and Henry's expensive interest
 uske adarsh vaakya tha "sabase adhik khush" or usne vyaktigat yukti ke rup main ek safed baaj chunaa tha
 Anne was blamed for the atrocities by her husband's government and some of her subjects called her a "king's prostitute" or a "naughty nutty"

 On January 8, 1536, news of Catherine's death of Aragon reached the king and Anne
 uski maut kii khabar sunakar ve bahut khush the
 The next day, Henry celebrated Catherine's death by wearing yellow from head to toe
 Yellow is a symbol of joy and celebration in England

 For this reason, wearing yellow by Henry and Anne can be a symbol of mourning

 a sermon by one of Anne-influenced evangelists is relatively new evidence that Anne's opposition to Cromwell and Henry's ruthless tactics in disintegrating the monasteries may have been their joint effort to end her power
 david starki or baad main apni nirnaayak jeevani ke nae sanskaran main rik ivs donon ne bataaya ki kis tarah saarvajanik upadesh raajnneetik raay ke prachaar or ghoshnaaon kaa mahatvapurn maadyam hua karte the
 Shortly before his fall, he suggests, Anne taught a sermon according to which Cromwell was an evil counselor in Esther's biblical story
 yah sambhav he ki shahi laabh ke liye mathon ko bhang karne kii yojana ke khilaaf eni kii avagya ne cromwel ko uski satta kaa takhta palatney ke liye majaboor kiya
 According to writer and Tudor historian Alison Wear, Thomas Cromwell plotted the plot of Anne's downfall, pretending to be sick and elaborating the plan on 20–21 April 1536
 eni ke jeevani lekhak erik ivs kaa maananaa he ki anya ke saath, uskaa patan or vadh thomas cromwel dwaara niojit the
 Conversations between Chapaeus and Cromwell indicate that there was a Cromwell inciting a plot to topple Anne, as evidenced by the Spanish Chronicle and letters written by Chapais to Charles V
 carch rajasav ke punarvitaran or videsh niti par eni kaa cromwel ke saath matbhed tha
 He advocated that revenue be distributed to charitable and educational institutions and supported a French alliance
 cromwel apane liye katautee rakhkar raja ke khaali khajaane ko bharne par jor de rahaa tha or ek shahi gathbandhan ke paksh main tha
 For these reasons, Ives suggests "anne Bolin had become a major threat to Cromwell Thomas
 " duusari taraf cromwel ke jeevani lekhak jon scofield kaa tark he ki eni or cromwel ke bich koi satta sangharsh nahin tha or ki "eni ke khilaaf cromwel kii sajeesh kaa koi sanket nahin miltaa
 

 maamle main henry ke aadesh par hi cromwel is shahi vaivaahik naatak main shaamil hua
 Cromwell did not make accusations of adultery, although he and other officials used him for Henry's case against Anne
 itihaaskaar retha warnik kaa sawaal he ki kya is tarah ke ek maamle main cromwel raja ke saath chaalaaki barat saktaa tha
 Henry himself issued important instructions, followed by Cromwell and officials
 itihaaskaar sahamat hai ki parinaam ek kanoonee uphaas ban gaya
 To do this, Master Secretary Cromwell would have needed sufficient evidence that would have sufficed for his conviction or he risked his position and perhaps life
 april ke ant main, eni kii seva main mark smiton naam kaa ek flemish sangeetkaar giraftaar kiya gaya shaayad use yatnaa di gai yaa swatantraaa kaa vaada kiya gaya
 She initially denied being the queen's lover but later confessed
 ek anya darbari, sar henry noris ko may diwas ko giraftaar kiya gaya tha chunki vah ek rais tha, use yatnaa nahin di ja sakati thi
 Before his arrest, the king was kindly treated by Norris, offering him his horse for use on the celebration of May Day
 It is likely that during the celebration the king was notified of Smitten's confession and shortly thereafter the alleged conspirators were arrested at the king's behest
 noris ko mahotsav main giraftaar kiya gaya
 Norris denies his crime and swears that Queen Anne was innocent

 On this charge, Sir Francis Weston was arrested two days later
 raja ke privi chambar ke saees sar wiliam breraton ko bhi vyabhichaar ke aadhaar par giraftaar kiya gaya
 The last arrested accused was Queen Anne's own brother who was accused of incest and treason, having sex with her sister

 In another form of treason, he was allegedly accused of plotting the king's death in association with his "lovers" so that he could later marry Henry Norris

 George Bolin and the other accused men were executed on 17 May 1536
 lord kingston, tower ke rakshak ne soochna di ki eni bahut khush thi or jivan khatm karne ke liye taiyaar lag rahi thi
 The king converted Anne's death sentence to slaughter and instead of cutting the queen's head with a common ax, employed a swordsman from St
 Omar
 ve may 19 kii subah eni ko green tower le jane ke liye aae
 Anthony Kingston, the sergeant of the Tower, wrote: i have seen many men and also women executed, and that they have been in great sorrow, and to my knowledge this lady has much joy in death
 Sir, her almoner is continually with her, and had been since two o'clock after midnight
 From the above, perhaps in spite of a poem on Anne Bolin, it is revealed that at some point her impending death must have hurt her greatly and hoped that death would relieve her of her suffering
 bhor hone se kuch hi samay pehle, usne samuhik prarthana sunne ke liye kingston ko bulaayaa or uski upasthiti main apni aatma kii anant mukti par, pavitra sanskaron par kasam khai ki usne kabhi bhi raja ke saath vishwasghaat nahin kiya
 He repeated his oath immediately before and after receiving the body and blood of Christ as a ritual
 may 19 kii shuukravaar kii subah, eni bolin ko nyaayik taur par maar daalaa gaya, green tower par nahin balki white tower ke uttar main banawaye gaye ek paad par jo aaj ke waterlu barrax ke saamne he usne ek deele gahare bhure rang ke fer lage or ermin poshish ke tahadaar jamdani goun ke neeche laal rang kaa peticot pahana tha
 Anne, along with two female attendants, came out of the Queen's House one last time for the scaffold and she "looked so happy as if she wasn't going to die"
 Annie climbed the scaffold and gave a brief speech to the crowd: yah uske bhaashan kaa ek sanskaran he jise uski mrityu ke kuch hafton baad lenslot de carles ne paris main likhaa, vah landan gaya tha lekin usne mukadmaa yaa vadh nahin dekha
 All details are identical and of course correct to varying degrees
 yah sochaa jaataa he ki parinaamon se apni beti or parivaar ko bachaane ke liye usne spasht rup se raja kii aalochana nahin kii kintu itane dabaav main bhi aparaadh kabool nahin kiya balki itihaaskaaron jo "uske maamle kii chaanbin karenge", ko kii gai apni apil main nirdosh hone kaa sanket diya
 Then in the French style of slaughter she sat upright on her knees
 apni antim prarthana main vah doharaati rahi, "yishu messiah ko main apni aatma samarpit karti hum; meri aatma prabhu yishu ko praapt kare
" Her hostess removed her headdress and necklace and then tied her blindfold
 Eric W
 According to Ives, his executioner was so impressed with Anne that he was shaken and had difficulty slaughtering
 use vichlit karne ke liye, vah chillaaya, "meri talwaar kahan he?" uski hatya se ain pehle taaki eni ko talwaar kaa pataa na chale
 The slaughter was swift and carried out in one stroke
 kaha jaataa he cranmar jo lambeth pales main tha, ales alexander ko yah kah kar ro padaa: "jo dharti par england kii rani rahi vah aaj swarg kii rani hogi
" When accusations were made against Anne for the first time, Cranmer expressed surprise and confided to Henry that "she should not be guilty
" Nevertheless, Cranmer felt himself insecure due to his closeness with the queen
 faansee kii raat se pehle, usne eni ke saath henry kii shaadi amaanya ghoshit kii jaise usne pehle catherine kii shaadi kii thi
 And he did not make any serious attempt to save Anne, although some sources say that after a final private hearing of her sins, she prepared him for death in which he stated his innocence to God
 haalanki, uski maut ke din ek scottish dost ne cranmar ko uske landan udyaan main foot-footkar rote dekha or yah kehete suna ki use yakeen he ki eni ab swarg ko chali gai
 Despite Anne's attempt to slaughter, Henry failed to organize any kind of funeral or to provide a proper coffin
 His body lay on the scaffold for some time when a man took an empty box of arrows from somewhere Came and put his head and body inside
 tab use saint peter aid vinkula chapel main ek gumnaam kabr main dafana diya gaya
 Her skeleton was identified during the renovation of the chapel during the reign of Queen Victoria and now Anne's tomb is marked in marble

 Since physical deformity was generally considered to be a devil's form, it is unlikely that Henry would have been romantically attracted to Anne Bolin if this had happened
 samakalinom dwaara eni bolin ko budhimaan, sangeet kala main pratibha sampann or adhyayansheel ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 She was also strong-willed and proud with the courage to quarrel with Henry
 jeevani lekhak erik ivs ne eni ke vyaktitv main spasht virodhabhas kaa moolyankan kiya he: Upon the autopsy in 1876, no abnormalities were found: her structure was delicate, about 5'3 ", with shapely, long fingers
 Elizabeth i certainly inherited her mother's frame, stature, face, and hand structure
 Was found eni bolin kaa koi samakaleen chitra nahin bachaa: keval ek sambhaavna uski duusari garbhavastha manaane ke liye 1534 main jari padak he, yah bhi buree tarah se kshatigrast he
 After the daughter's coronation as queen, Anne was honored as a martyr and heroine of English reformism, especially in the works of John Fox who argued that Anne would have saved England from the evils of Roman Catholicism
 And God has given proof of her innocence and purity by making her daughter Elizabeth i the queen

 " sadiyon se, eni ne prerit kiya he yaa kai kalatmak or saanskrithik kritiyon main ullekh kiya gaya he
 As a result, she has been in popular memory and Anne has been called "england's most influential and important queen wife to date
" " Many myths and legends have been made about Anne Bolin through the centuries
 ek yah he ki use norfock main saile carch main, uske bolin purvajon kii kabron ke paas kaali slab ke neeche chupake se dafnaaya gaya tha

 It goes on growing and the second, third class root branches grow out of it
 aisi jad ko musla jad kehete hai
 The roots consist of moolagopa and root hairs, by which plants grow by absorbing salts from the soil

 Branches arising from it are exogenous, that is, they do not grow from the inner skin like branches of roots, but from external tissue
 tane par pattee, parnaklika tathaa pushpaklika lagi hoti he
 Many types of stem are found in closed seeds
 inhen saadharantaya majboot tathaa durbal tanon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he

 Weak stems are also of several types, such as trailing or trailing, cropping etc
 shakha ke tane se nikalne kii riti ko "shakha vinyas" kehete hai
 If the main branch is divided into two parts from one place, then it is called bisectoral configuration, otherwise if twigs are coming out from the side of main stem, then it is called lateral configuration
 dwibhaji vibhaajan ke bhi kai rup hote hai, jaise yatharth dwivibhaajan, yaa kundalani, yaa vrischiki 
 The lateral branches either grow indefinitely, called the infinite branch configuration, or the one in which the growth of the branches stops and is called the submaximal configuration

 The food made is transported to every part of the plant by the stem itself
 iske atirikt tane paudhon ko khambhe ke rup main sidhaa khadaa rakhte hai
 These are helpful in preparing food by giving birth to leaves and carrying out flowers by giving birth to flowers
 bahut se tane bhojan kaa sangrah bhi karte hai
 Some stems do not grow directly on their own due to being thin and others cling to a strong base or other tree and grow upwards
 kuch main tane kaanton main parivartit ho jate hai
 In many plants, the stems grow under the soil and many stems perform various functions, such as the altered stem of ginger, which is eaten
 ise prakand kehete hai
 Potato is also such a stem which is called tuber
 in tanon par bhi kalika rahati he, jo padap prasaaran ke kaary aati he
 The onion-eating part of the onion is the stem under the soil, which is called the shell tuber

 Garlic, cana, banapaji and many other such trunks are found in a monocot
 suuran tathaa bande kaa bhi khaanevaala bhaag bhumigat rahata he or yah bhi shakha kaa hi rup he, jise ghan kand kehete hai
 Such a variation of the stem is found in many plants, some parts of which do special work while remaining below the ground and some part above the ground, such as the stems of fertile ground in the grassy grass lying on the earth and root from their ridges
 It penetrates into the soil
 isi se milte julate bhustari prakaar ke tane hote hai, jaise jhumakalata, yaa chameli ityadi
 The stems are in the hyacinth, and the inland stems are in the mint
 kuch hawaii tane yaa stambh bhi kai vishesh roopon main parivartit ho jate hai, jaise naagfani main chapate, rascus main pattee ke rup main tathaa kuch paudhon main anya rup dhaaran karte hai
 In the internal structure also, the shape of the column is largely of a type, in which monocot and dicot can be identified only by internal composition
 stambh main bhi bahirtvacha, valkut tathaa sanvahan silinder hote hai
 In a monocot, the convection bridge is devoid of closed, ie non-growth agha, and in the dicotyledon there is secondary growth, which is by a common method
 kuch paudhon main paristhiti ke kaaran, yaa anya kaarnon se vishesh prakaar se bhi, gaun vruddhi hoti he
 Leaves are also used for special work in plants of closed plants

 Initial Public Offering, when a company issues its common stock or shares to the public for the first time, it is called an IPO or a "public offer"
 It is mostly issued by small, new companies that capitalize to grow their business
 Wants, but it can also be issued by large privately-owned companies who want to do business in the public market
 ipos are a way for companies to enter the stock market

 ipos can be a risky investment
 For individual investors, it is difficult to predict how the shares will perform in their early day trading and in the near future as they do not have enough data to analyze the company as well as most ipos
 Those companies are going through a temporary development, so there is uncertainty in terms of their future value

 Common examples include: aamtaur par ek bade ipo kii hamidari nivesh bainkon ke kisi sanghathan ke dbaara kii jaati he, jiskaa netritv ek yaa adhik bade nivesh bank kar rahe hote hai sheyaron kii bikri par hamidaaron ko aadhat milti he jo beche gaye sheyaron ke mulya par aadhaarit hoti he aamtaur par, pramukh hamidaar yani vah hamidaar jinhon ne ipo ke sabase bade hisse beche hai, sabase zyada kamishan pate hai - kuch maamalon main 8 % tak
 In a multinational IPO, the issuer's company may have up to three organizations of underwriters to deal with different legal requirements to suit other markets
 For example, an EU issuing company is represented in its domestic market, Europe, The principal underwriting organization may
 anya bazaaron jaise america / canada or asia ke liye alag hamidaar sanghathan ho sakate hai aamtaur par, pramukh bazaar kaa pramukh hamidaar bank anya bazaaron main bhi company kaa pramukh hamidaar hota he
 Because of such broad legal requirements, ipos typically work with one or more law firms, such as Magic Circle Firms of London and White Shoe Firm of New York City aamtaur par, peshkash main nai poonji ekartrit karne ke liye nae sheyaron kaa nirgam evam maujuuda sheyaron kii anushanbee bikri shaamil hoti he
 However, most of the existing shares are subject to certain regulatory restrictions and restrictions imposed by key underwriters

 Most ipos can be found on the Nasdaq stock market, which lists computer and information technology related companies
 But, relatively new and untested firms are large
 Despite the availability of large amount of financial resources, a large number of firms started falling into cash crisis
 The crisis was particularly in cases where the founding party had sold an important portion of its stake immediately after the atav issue of the IPO
 yah ghatana thi sanyukt rajya tak simit nahin thi
 In Japan, for example, a similar situation was presented
 kuch companiyon is tarah ho rahaa tha jaise ipo jari karnaa hi unka ekmaatr lakshya ho kuch share bazaar aisi hi companiyon ke liye sthapit kiye gaye the, jaise kii nasdac japan 
 Perhaps the most obvious bubbles in the history of the hot IPO market were in 1929 and 1989, when ipos of limited-term funds were sold at extremely large premiums
 If we compare the market value of limited-term funds to the value of the shares included in the fund
 Bubbles are seen when the market price is in multiples of the underlying value

 People's perception about the IPO may be controversial
 The IPO was a complete failure for the people who got it as much capital as possible
 It was important to note that there are different types of investors in an auction and in the open market - the auction was believed to be a complete success for those who were measuring the IPO by the benefits of devaluation to investors
 Institutions bid in and individual investors in the open market Google may be a special case but because many individual investors have recently issued ipo's for stock Mbi term buy to keep in mind ke value, aitihaasik taur par dekhen to america or vaishvik donon hi staron par ipo avamoolyit rahe hai ipo kaa praarambhik avamulyan, stock ke pehali baar kaarobaar main aate samay usame atirikt ruchi paidaa karne kaa kaam karata he yah un niveshkon ke liye ullekhneey laabh kaa strot ho saktaa he jinhen 'maangi keemat' par share mili hon haalanki, ipo kaa avamulyan karne par company ko us poonji ko tyaagna hota he jise vah stock ko unche mulya par vikray kar praapt kar sakati thi The risk of overvaluation is also an important consideration

 isse spasht hota he ki gurukul gaanvon ke sannikat hi hote the
 There was also a fear of their favoritism and attraction towards Brahmachari's house in pleading with the Swatis, and hence there was a complete prohibition of begging from the Swatis

 In ancient India, under the direct supervision of the Guru, learning was considered superior

 Guru Jan used to make arrangements for the residence of the student at his home
 bhojan kaa kaary bhiksha vritti dwaara chalata tha athwa adhyaaapak ke grih main bhi vyavastha ho jaati thim
 At that time, a teacher often did not read more than fifteen students simultaneously
 kabhi-kabhi to keval chaar vidhyaarthee hi ek guru ke adheen adhyayan karte the
 Therefore, arranging their food and residence was not a difficult task for the Guru
 kintu guru ke vidhyaarthiyon kaa prabandh karne main asamarth hone par vidhyaarthee apane rahane kaa prabandh swayan karte the
 It was considered extremely disgraceful for the teacher to ask for money from the student in teaching work
 guru nirdhan se nirdhan vidhyaarthee ko bhi padhaane se manaa nahin kar saktaa tha
 The guru who used to bargain for learning was considered as a practitioner of learning
 aise adhyapakon ko dharmik avasaron par ruthvik ke kaary ke ayogy kaha gaya
 But by the same letter taught by the Guru, the disciple was considered indebted to him
 atev samaavartan ke avasar par shishy guru-dakshina ke rup main samarthyanusaar guru ko dhan dete the

 But gradually, due to the abundant increase in the store of learning, the interest of people towards specialization started increasing
 atev vidhyaarthiyon ke liye parivaar se duurastha sthanon par jaakar pratishthit vidwaanon ke sangrakshan main vaanchit vishyon kaa adhyayan karnaa aavashyak ho gaya
 Often, girls also had to go outside the house to learned scholars to get higher education
 kintu is sambandh main hamaare granthon se bahut kam sanket praapt hote hai
 In Uttara Ramcharit, there is a mention of a woman named Atreyi studying with love-kush in Valmiki's ashram
 jo is baat kaa pusht pramaan he ki us yug main sah-shiksha kaa prachaar tha
 Similarly, in 'malti-madhava', Bhavabhuti, along with Bhurivasu and Devrat, has described a woman named Kamandaki receiving education in the same school
 bhawabhooti aathvi shatabdi ke kavi hai
 Therefore, it seems that if not during Bhavabhuti time, there must have been a trend of co-education of boys and girls till some time before that
 isi prakaar puraanon main kahod or sujatha, ruhu or pramadavara kii kathaayen varnit hai
 It is known from these that girls were studying in schools as well as boys and they were married when they were young
 parinamat: kabhi-kabhi gandharv vivaah bhi ho jate the
 All these evidences throw light on the fact that in that era women could have attained knowledge by living among men without curtains
 us yug main sahashiksha-pranali kaa astitv bhi inase siddh hota he
 The idea of co-education was propagated in the Gurukuls, which is also supported by the method of incorporation described in the Assumption Home Sasutra
 is vidhi main snaatak ke anulepan kriya ke varnan main balak evam balika kaa samarvatan sanskaar saath-saath sampann hona paaya jaataa he
 In that era, the appropriateness of the Brahmacharyasrama, Vedadhyayana and Samvartana rites of a woman is proved according to the assurance
 purv kaal main jab badi sankhya main striyaan ucch shiksha grahan kar rahi thim or apana amuly yogadan dekar sahitya ke gaurav ko badha rahi thim, us samay unamem se kuch adhyaapan kaary bhi avashya hi karti hongi
 The usage of the words Upadhyaya and Upadhyayani is found in Sanskrit literature
 upaadhyaay kii patni ko aadar purvak upaadhyaayani kaha gaya he, kintu upaadhyaaya un vidhushi naariyon ke liye prayukt hua he jo adhyaapan kaary karti thim
 The need to compose another word that makes sense of female teachers would have been possible only if there were sufficient number of female teachers
 iske atirikt pardaapratha barahavin shatabdi ke baad bhartiya samaaj main aayi, atevam striyon ke liye adhyaapan kaary main kisi prakaar ke bandhan kii sambhaavna bhi na thi
 It may be that these titles have been taught only to girls or both boys and girls
 panini ne bhi acharya evam aacharyani ke antar ko spasht kiya he tathaa chatrishalaon kaa ullekh kiya he
 It can be inferred from this that the teachers would also be the guardians of these schools

 As a result of losing to Shankaracharya, after her husband Mandan Mishra retired, Sanjay Bharti started teaching in Shringagiri

 However, due to lack of space and inconveniences, most of the girls would study at home and would not have the courage to pursue higher education

 Although there were highly educated women in this period like Maitreyi, Gargi, Vishvavara and leela-vati, it cannot be concluded from this that there was a sufficient prevalence of female education in this era or that female education existed in its organized form

 According to Mookerji - `` It is possible that in this age there was no organized system of education for women
 sambhavat: jab samaaj main yogya upaadhyaayaayen praapt ho jaati hongi tab unheen ke sangrakshan main kanyaon ko bheja jaataa hoga kintu inke uplabdh na hone par baadhya hokar aacharyon ke paas putriyon kii adhyayanarth bhejnaa padataa hoga
 In the era where Gandharva marriage was not uncommon in the society, parents of the girls would not have any objection in the co-education
 kintu aage chalakar gandharv-vivaah se kanyaon ke naitik patan kii ashanka badhane lagi
 Therefore, people started arranging higher education for girls by appointing teachers at home
 ucch shiksha hetu duurastha aacharyon ke paas jane vaali kanyaon kii sakhya bhi adhik na rahi hogi kyonki jaatakon main shiksha hetu takshashila jane vaali balikaon kaa ullekh praapt nahin hota
 There were no public schools for boys until the fourth century BCE
 harit ne vyavastha di he ki kanyaon kii shiksha ghar par hi pita, chachaa athwa bhai dwaara honi chahie
 Similarly, Manu is also not in favor of sending the girls out of the house to study with the boys under the protection of male teachers, because co-education increases the chances of destroying the virginity of the girls
 stri-shiksha kaa pratham sangathit prayaas karne kaa shrey baudhdho ko praapt he
 The Buddha had allowed the entry of women into the Sangha
 baudhon ne viharon main nivas karne vaali bhikshuniyon ke liye shiksha kii santoshajanak vyavastha bhi kii thi
 Like the Brahmavadinis, many of these women pursued celibacy for the knowledge of religion and philosophy
 inamen se kuch sinhal desh bhi gayi tathaa vahaan buddha dharm kii mahaan shikshikaaon ke rup main unhone vishesh prasiddhi praapt kii
 These girls used to take co-education in these viharas
 kintu in buddha sanghon main bhi isa kii chauthi shatabdi ke lagbhag nari shiksha kaa purna hraas ho chukaa tha
 How many percent of the students will take co-education, this question can certainly not be answered
 kintu nishchay hi yah sankhya adhik nahin rahi hogi
 Currently, Acharyakulam has been established by Baba Ramdev to promote Vedic education
 acharyakulam kii sthapana karne ke peeche baba ramdev kaa uddeshy he vaidic or bhartiya shiksha ko badhaava mili
 Acharyakulam is a residential educational institution based on Gurukul system as well as modern education system based on Gurukul system, located in Haridwar, Uttarakhand state of India
 isaki sabase khaas baat he ki yahan 8 veen tak 50 pratishat vaidic or 50 pratishat sibiesai kaa paathyakram padhaayaa jaataa he
 This is followed by 25 percent Vedic and 75 percent CBSE syllabus of the 8th
 saath hi yah aisa pehla skool he jahaan vidhyaarthee ko jitani angreji sikhaai jaati utani hi sanskrit main bhi paarangat kiya jaataa he|haal hi main acharyakulam sibiesai board se judaa he
 There is a wonderful confluence of modern and Vedic education in Acharyakulam, here, apart from the NCERT curriculum, there are three periods of Vedic education
 inamen veda, upanishad, sanskrit, yoga, havan-pujan aadi kaa gyaan diya jaataa he
 The history of ancient Indian education has been written over a long period of thousands of years
 at: yah atyant vishaal he
 Memoirs indicate a specific period of change in Sanskrit literature
 unke madhyam se vaidic kaal se lekar unke apane samay tak kii samast saahitiyik rachanaaon kii shrinkhalaa kaa purvabhaas karaayaa gaya he
 Therefore, for the study of Smritikalin students, the Vedas, Brahmins, Upanishads and Sutras were all the main compositions of the period
 isa purv pandraa sau shatabdi tak adhikansh vaidic mantron ke sampaadan kaa kaary purna ho chukaa tha
 Subsequently, the commentary and discussion texts developed for the meaning of the Vedas became known as 'brahmin' texts
 is kaal ke vidwaanon kii pratibha kaa upyog vedon ke swaroop kii raksha evam arthon ke spashti-karan main kiya gaya, na ki naveen saahitiyik-rachanaaon ke nirupan main
 As a result, many theories, opinions and rituals related to Vedic Yajnas began to be discussed in 'brahmins'
 vidwaanon ne vishesh rup se apni sadhana kaa kendra yagyon ke karmkand ko banaaya
 As a result, there was complexity and difficulty in rituals
 duusari ore vedon kii darshanik pravriti kaa vikaas hua or usne `upanishdon' ke rup main purnataa praapt kii
 In chronological order, there was also a considerable increase in Vedatikaran literature
 falat: is satat vardhaman sahitya main paarangat hona akele ek vyakti kii samarthy ke baahar ho gaya
 The printing art did not develop in that period
 atev vaidic sahitya ke lop ho jane kaa bhay sadaa bana rahata tha
 From the literature-security point of view the study area was divided into two parts
 vaidic panditon main se kuch ko is vishaal sahitya ko jyon kaa tyon kanthsth karne kaa kaary saunpa gaya, jisase sahitya kaa shuddh swaroop akshunn bana rahe tathaa anya vidwaanon kii tikaaon nirukton or shabdkosh aadi kaa adhyayan karke inaki vyakhya karne main apni pratibha ke pradarshan kaa avasar diya gaya
 During this period, the most decisive and creative genius of Hindu Megha emerged
 falswaroop shiksha, darshan, nyaay, mahakavy, bhashavigyaan, vyakaran, jyotish, nirukt, kalp, anekon kalaayen, vyaavhaarik vidya aadi ke kshetron main mahatvapurn safaltaayen praapt hui
 The scholars of these texts renewed these subjects for the convenience of their students and collected them in the comments
 upanishdon evam sutron ke kaal main lekhan kala kaa gyaan ho jane par bhi inhen lipibaddh nahin kiya gaya kyonki vaidic mantron ko lipi baddh karnaa adharmik mana jaataa tha
 In the same period, on the basis of Vedic phases, scholars also composed a new literature in the Dharmasutras
 uparyukt sanskrit-vaanmay ke parivartansheel itihaas ko drushtigat karte hue ham uski vividhta evam vishalata kaa sahaj hi anumaan laga sakate hai
 The social customs, religious rituals, and rites described in this book have been surveyed in the memories
 vastut: smritiyaan ek vishaal samaaj ko lakshya karke hi nirmit kii gayi hai
 We also hope to mention this literature in the books of memory
 atev inamen grihyasutron, dharmasutron, upanishdon tathaa mimasaaon main purv vidyaman shreshth prathaon, ritiyon, manyataon evam sanskaron kaa sankalan kiya gaya he
 No other memory has as much success as Manusmriti has achieved in this work
 at: yahaan par manu smriti main sanketit vishyon kaa hi ullekh kiya ja rahaa he
 Manu has called the three Vedas as Shruti
 ye teen veda hi sanskrit sahitya kii pratham kadi hai
 Vedic Mantras were developed as stages, whose priests received knowledge of the desired branches
 mantra, brahman, shakha ko padhe hue 'rigvedi'; vedon ke pargami, samast shakhaon ke gyaata 'rutvij' tathaa vedon ko padhakar paarangat hue vidvan brahman ko vishisht sammaan praapt tha
 Brahmins who knew the three Vedas were called 'trivedi'
 manusmriti main adhyayan ke liye vedon ke kuch pramukh vishesh rup se paarit kiye gayi hai
 In fact, by this time, the processes of purification through religious activities and atonement had greatly expanded
 atev vishisht avasaron par vedon kii kuch richaon ke uccharan kaa mahatv bhi bad gaya
 In Manu Smriti, it has been said that such utterances should be pronounced with complete balance and rule so that one can be free from sins
 brahman atharvaveda kii angiras shruti kaa prayog shatru ke naash ke liye shastr ke rup main karte the
 In the daily Swadhyaya lessons of the graduates, the study of Brahmin texts has been encouraged
 manu ne aitarey brahman ke `subrahmanya' naamak mantron evam aitarey brahman tathaa bah vruch brahman main varnit shunagashep gaatha kaa bhi ullekh kiya he
