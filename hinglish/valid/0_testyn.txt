 ateet ke chalchitr mahadevi verma dwaara rachit ek rekhachitr he
 In this, the writer introduces us to these eleven characters Rama, sister-in-law, Binda, Sabia, Bitto, girl child, Ghisa, unfortunate woman, Alopi, Bablu and Alopa
 sabhi rekha-chitron ko unhone apane jivan se hi liya he, isiilie inamen unke apane jivan kii vividh ghatnaon tathaa charitra ke vibhinn pahaluon kaa pratyaropan anayas hi hua he
 He has given the true truths as it is
 mahadevi ke rekhachitron kii yah visheshta bhi he ki unamem charitra chithran kaa tatv pramukh rahaa he or kathy usee kaa ek hissaa maatr he
 In these, serious folk philosophy is inaugurated, which points towards the cultural stream of our life
 'ateet ke chal-chitra' main sevak 'rama' kii vatsalyapurna seva, bhangin 'sabia' kaa pati-parayanata or sahansheeltaa, 'ghisa' kii nishchal gurubhakti, saag-bhaaji bechney vaale andhe 'alopi' kaa saral vyaktitv, kumhaar 'badalu' va 'radhiya' kaa saral daanpaty prem tathaa pahaad kii ramani 'lachama' kaa mahadevi ke prati anupam prem, yah sab prasang mahadevi ke chithran kii akut kshamta kaa parichay dete hai
 Son of the trusted Sardar Dhanaji Yadav of Chandrasen King Sambhaji Bhonsle
 pita ke baad chandrasen pradhan senapati bana
 By secretly favoring Tarabai, Shivaji's mother, Sahuji appointed Balaji Vishwanath to keep an eye on him
 sanyog se ek din shikaar khelte samay chandrasen or balaji vishwanath main ladaai ho gai
 Chandrasen ran to Tarabai
 san 1712 i
 main jab tarabai or shivaji karagaar main daale gaye or maharani rajsabai kolhapur main pradhan niyukt hui chandrasen is dar se ki kahin vah pakadakar saahuji ke paas na bhej diya jaay, bhagkar nizamulmulk asafajah ke paas pahunchaa or uski salaah se vah badshaah farrukhsier kii seva main chalaa aayaa
 The emperor gave him the blessing and gave him many fiefs of Bidar province
 isane panchamahal talluke main kashna nadi ke paas ek pahari par chota sa durg banwaaya jiskaa naam chandragarh rakhaa
 Chandrasen assisted Asaf Jah in 1726 AD when Nizamulmulk Asafjah's ascension to Sahuji
 shairan, jise kairan bhi kehate hai, boune grah yama kaa sab se bada upgrah he
 It was discovered in 1978
 2015 main pluto or shairan kaa adhyayan karne ke liye america sarkaar dwaara ek "new horaedens" naam kaa manushya-rahit antariksh yaan bhejne kii yojana he
 The Sharon is circular and has a diameter of 1,207 km, which is slightly more than half the diameter of Pluto
 uski sataha kaa kul kshetrafal lagbhag 45
8 lakh varg kilometre he
 Where there is frozen ice of nitrogen and methane on the surface of Pluto, there is water on the Sharon instead of it
 pluto par ek patala vayumandal he lekin shairan ke adhyayan se sanket mila he ke usapar koi vayumandal nahin he or uski sataha ke upar sirf khule antariksh kaa vyom he
 Sharon has fewer stones and more snow than Pluto
 shairan ko angrezi main "charon" likhaa jaataa he
 Astronomers differ among themselves as to whether there are different layers of ice and stone inside the Sharon, or that the entire satellite has the same ice and stone mixture
 pluto or shairan kaa ghanatv dekhakar andaja lagaaya jaataa he ke pluto kaa 70% dravyaman pathar he jabaki shairan kaa keval 50-55% pathar he
 This has led some scientists to think that a massive collision of some other object on Pluto caused it to collect the debris above as a satellite
 isliye shairan main pluto kii upree sataha kii barf adhik he or pluto ke andar ke pathar kam
 But this idea raises a doubt - if it had actually happened, an even larger percentage of Sharon should have been made of ice and an even larger percentage of Pluto would have been made of stone
 isliye kuch anya vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke shairan or pluto shuru se hi alag vastuen thim jo takaraai, lekin phir alag hokar ek-dusre kii parikrama karne lagi
 The combination of Pluto and Sharon is unique in the solar system
 shairan kaa vyas pluto ke aadhe se zyaada he or uskaa dravyaman pluto kaa 11
6% he - jo saura mandal main kisi bhi upgrah-grah kii jodi main sabase adhik he
 For comparison, the diameter of the Earth's moon is about one-fourth that of the Earth and only 1
2% of the Earth's mass
 is kaaran se pluto or shairan kaa mila hua dravyaman kendra kaa bindu pluto ke andar nahin balki in donon ke bich ke khule vyom main padataa he or pluto or shairan donon is bindu kii parikrama karte hai
 If the definitions of astronomy are strictly imposed, then in such a situation, two astronomical objects are called twin planets rather than planetary satellites
 phir bhi aam taur par shairan ko pluto kaa upgrah hi mana jaataa he

 pratidravya In particle physics, the impedance or antimatter is virtually an extension of the antiparticle theory of matter
 duusare shabdon main, jis prakaar padaarth kanon kaa bana hota he usee prakaar pratidravya pratikanon se milakar bana hota he
 For example, an antiherogen atom can combine to form an antielectron and an antiproton in the same way that an electron and a proton combine to form hydrogen atoms
 saath hi padaarth evam antimatter ke sangam kaa parinaam donon kaa vinaash hota he, thik vaise hi jaise antipartical evam kan kaa sangam hota he
 Resulting in high-energy photons or other particle-antiparticle pairs
 vaise vigyaan kathaon or science fiction chalchitron main kai baar antimatter kaa naam suna jaataa rahaa he
 An antimatter is not just an imaginary element, but a real element
 isaki khoj beesvin shatabdi ke purvaaddh main hui thi
 Since then it has remained a matter of curiosity for scientists till date
 jis tarah sabhi bhautik vasteen matter yani padaarth se banati hai or swayan matter main protone, electron or neutron hote hai, usee tarah antimatter main antiprotone, positrons or antinutron hote hai
 Antimatter is a name given to all these subtle elements
 sabhi partical or antiparticals kaa aakaar ek samaan kintu aavesh bhinn hote hai, jaise ki ek electron rinaveshi hota he jabaki positron ghanaveshi charge hota he
 When Matter and Antimatter come in contact with each other, both are destroyed
 brahmad kii utpatti kaa siddhant mahavisphot aisi hi takaraahat kaa parinaam tha
 However, they are not found in the surrounding universe today, but according to scientists, Matter and Antimatter were scattered everywhere immediately after the Big Bang responsible for the beginning of the universe
 virdohi kan aapas main takaraae or baari maatra main urja gamma kirnon ke rup main nikali
 Most of the matter was destroyed in this collision and only a small amount of matter is left in the nearby universe
 is kshetra main 50 karod prakaash varsh dur tak sthit taare or akashganga shaamil hai
 According to scientists estimates, antimatter is likely to be found in the distant universe
 antarrashtriya str ke khagolashastriyon ke ek samooh ne europea antariksh agency ke gamma-kiran vedhashala se mili chaar saal ke aankadon ke adhyayan ke baad bataaya he ki akaash ganga ke madhya main dikhne vaale badal asal main gamma kirane hai, jo antimatter ke positron or electron se takaraane par nikalati hai
 The collision between the positron and the electron emits about 511 thousand electron volts of energy
 in rahasyamayi badalon kii akruti akashganga ke centre se pare, puri tarah gol nahin he
 The second end of its rounded central region has an irregular shape with nearly twice the expansion
 antimatter kii khoj main rat vaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ki blike hole dwaara taron ko do hisson main chirane kii ghatana main antimatter avashya utpann hota hoga
 In addition, they are also attempting to generate anti-particles by high-energy particle-accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider
 prithvi par antimatter kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti, lekin vaigyanikon ne prayogshaalaon main bahut thodi maatra main antimatter kaa nirmaan kiya he
 In natural form, the antimatter comes into existence when the space waves on Earth enter the Earth's atmosphere, or by the breakdown of radioactive material
 sheeghra nasht ho jane ke kaaran yah prithvi par astitv main nahin aata, lekin bahya antariksh main yah badi maatr main uplabdh he jise atyaadhunik yantron kii sahaayta se dekha ja saktaa he
 Antimatter is very useful as a renewed fuel
 lekin ise banane kii prakriya filhaal iske eendhan ke taur par antat: hone vaale prayog se kahin adhik mahangi padati he
 Apart from this, it is also used in medicine to detect cancer through stomach scan
 saath hi kai radiation takneekon main bhi iskaa prayog prayog hota he
 According to NASA, antimatter is the most expensive material on Earth
 1 milligram antimatter banane main 250 lakh dollar rupee tak lag jate hai
 Antimatter can be used as a fuel in aircraft going to other planets in space
 1 gram antimatter kii keemat 312500 arab rupee he

 britishon ko tarai se avlokan jari rakhane ke liye majaboor kiya gaya, nepal ke dakshin main ek kshetra he jo himalay ke samaanaantar main he
 The situation in the Terai was very difficult due to high rainfall and malaria: three survey officers died due to malaria while two were discharged due to poor health

 jon armastrang, jo vaug ke sah adhikari thea ne bhi ek jagah se dur pashchim main is chotii ko dekha jise unhone naam diya chotii ‘bi’
 Waugh later wrote that the observation indicates that the peak 'B' was higher than the Kanchenjunga, but the observation was from far away, it is necessary to observe closely for verification
 aane vaale saal main vaug ne ek survey adhikari ko tarai main chotii ‘bi’ ko nazdik se avlokan karne ke liye bheja par badalon ne saare prayaas ko roak diya
 In 1849, Waugh ceded the area to James Nicholson
 nicholson ne 190 kimi dur jirol se do avlokan taiyaar kiye
 Nicholson then brought a large conglomerate with him and headed east, with Nicholson from five different locations receiving more than 30 observations from 174 km to the nearest peak
 apane avlokanon par aadhaarit kuch hisaab-kitaab karne ke liye nicholson waapas patna, ganga nadi ke paas gaya
 Its rough calculation in Patna gave the average height of peak 'B' at 9,200 m मी, but it is not considered light refraction, which makes the elevation false

 a death occurring to work with a patient of the heart and lungs can be determined to be legally declared dead without a dead brain
 Accurate definition of death is medical, in other words more ironically advances scientific knowledge and medicine
 Becomes problematic
 mrityu yaa majboot sanket ke lakshan he ki ek vyakti ab bhi zindaa hai: The concept of death is the key event
 There are many scientific methods for conceptualizing
 udhaaharan ke liye, mastishk mrityu, vigyaan ke rup main chikitsa abhyaas main, mastishk gatividhi ke dauraan rahata he jo samay ke rup main paribhaashit maut ek bindu main
 ek maut main paribhaashit karne kii chunautiyon ke jivan se yah bhed he
 As a point in time, it appears to refer to the moment of death at which life ends
 haalanki, jab nirdhaaran maut hui he jivan or maut ke bich vaicharik simaaon sateek drawing kii aavashyaktaa he
 This is problematic because there is little consensus over how to define life
 yah sambhav he chetana ke sandarbh main jivan ko paribhaashit
 jab chetana rahata he, ek jivit jeev ke liye mar gaya he kaha ja saktaa
 is drushtikon main ullekhneey kharabi kii, haalanki, ki vahaan kai jeev jo jivit hai lekin shaayad udhaaharan ke liye nahin sachet kar rahe hai, ekal sayled jeev is drushtikon ke saath ek or samasya chetana he, jo kai alag alag aadhunik vaigyanikon, manovaigyanikon or darshanikon dwaara di gai paribhaasha ke paribhaashit karne main kiya jaataa he
 This common problem of defining death applies to the specific challenge of defining death in the context of medicine
 ke bare main kuch vighn charitra par dhyaan kendrit maut ke liye paribhaashaayen anya
 is sandarbh main "" maut keval rajya he jahaan kuch rah gai he, jaise, jivan varnan karata he
 Thus, "the definition of life together defines death
" aitihaasik, ek insaan kii mrityu ke kshan ko paribhaashit karne kaa prayaas samasyagrast kiya gaya he
 And arrest is defined as a once-off heart beat, but the development of CPR and early defibrillation is insufficient definition provided that breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted
 Incidents of death which were now associated in any previous condition without killing everyone in a functioning heart or lungs, can be a continuous combination of life support devices, sometimes with prostheses and prostheses
 aaj, ek mrityu ke kshan kii paribhaasha, aavashyak jahaan doctoron or coroners aamtaur par naidanik mrit baari karne ke liye mastishk "mrityu" yaa jaivik "maut hone ke ek vyakti ke rup main paribhaashit karne ke liye", logon ko mrit mana jaataa he jab unke mastishk gatividhi vidyut rahata he
 It is believed that an end of electrical activity is also a sign of an end of consciousness
 haalanki, chetana ke nilamban or sthai hona chahie, na kshanik, ke rup main charnon neend ke dauraan kuch hota he or vishesh rup se coma
 sone ke maamle main, anada antar kar sakate hai aasaani se bataata he However, the category "brain death" is seen by some scholars to be problematic
 For example, Dr
 Franklin Miller, senior faculty member of the Department of Bioethics, National Institutes of Health, notes, "since the 1990s, however, humans were increasingly being challenged by scholars, based on evidence of death
" The equations of brain death with respect to the array of biological functioning exhibited by patients correctly conditioned on mechanical ventilation for a considerable period of time
 Placed as being identifies maintained the ability to keep these patients to maintain circulation and respiration, control temperature, excrete wastes, heal wounds, fight infections and most dramatically, to gestate fetuses for " un logon ko banaae rakhane kii maut he ki praantastha-ke nav keval ke liye aavashyak he kabhi kabhi mastishk chetana kaa tark he ki keval vidyut gatividhi ko paribhaashit karnaa chahie ho saktaa he jab mana jaataa he
 Ultimately it is possible that the criterion for death will be the permanent and irreversible loss of cognitive function, brain death as a whole
 Personality thinking is the realization of all hope for human recovery and then medical technology is gone
 haalanki, vartmaan main, main sabase adhik maut roodhiwaadee paribhaasha ke sthanon puure mastishk gatividhi main vidyut aparivartaneey samaapti ke rup main praantastha-nav virodh karne ke liye bas main he apanaaya gaya he maut kaa nirdhaaran udhaaharan ke liye vardi sanyukt rajya america adhinium he 2005 main, terry schhvo maamle raajnneeti ke america saamne laayaa sawaal karne ke liye jeevika or kritrim mastishk mrityu hota he Whole brain parameters may also be complicated by resolution of brain death

 In the United States, a person is legally dead if a death certificate or a statement of death is obtained by a medical practitioner
 Various legal consequences follow the death, including the removal from the person in legal terminology which is called parsonhud

" ) Being declared dead by many physicians and then "coming back to life", sometimes about several days later when your coffin, or embalming process are started
 Since the mid-18th century, there was a wave of fear being publicly buried in a live accident, and uncertainty about the symptoms of death had also caused much debate to be made to test for signs of life
 Suggestions were the first burials
 Punchers applied to the mouth of the rectum ranging from pepper and vinegar to pouring
 Writing in 1895, physician JC Ousele claimed that Tate

 Mahashivratri is a major festival of Hindus
 yah bhagwaan shiv kaa pramukh parv he
 Phalgun Krishna Chaturdashi is celebrated Shivaratri festival

 According to mythology, the creation of this day began with the rise of Agnilinga
 adhik tar log yah manyata rakhte he ki isi din bhagwaan shiv kaa vivaah devi parvati ke saath hua tha
 Mahashivaratri is considered to be the most important of the 12 Shivaratris that occur in the year
 kashmir shaiva mat main is tyohaar ko har-raatri or bolchaal main 'herath' yaa 'herath' bhi jaataa he
 There are many mythological stories related to Mahashivaratri: mahashivaratri ke din bhagwaan shiv ne kalkut naamak vish ko apane kanth main rakh liya tha
 Which came out at the time of churning the sea
 ek baar parvati ji ne bhagwaan shivashankar se poocha, 'aisa koun-sa shreshth tathaa saral vrath-pujan he, jisase mrityulok ke praani aapaki krupa sahaj hi praapt kar lete hai?' uttar main shivaji ne parvati ko 'shivaratri' ke vrath kaa vidhaan bataakar yah katha sunai- 'ek baar chitrabhanu naamak ek shikari tha
 He raised his family by killing animals
 vah ek sahuukaar kaa rini tha, lekin uskaa rin samay par na chukaa sakaa
 The angry moneylender captives the hunter at Shivamath
 sanyog se us din shivaratri thi
 ' shikari dhyanamgn hokar shiv-sambandhi dharmik baaten sunata rahaa
 He also heard the story of Shivaratri fast on Chaturdashi
 sandhya hote hi sahuukaar ne use apane paas bulaayaa or rin chukaane ke vishay main baat kii
 The hunter left the bond the next day, promising to return the loan
 apni dincharya kii bhaanti vah jangal main shikaar ke liye niklaa
 But due to being in captivity all day, he was disturbed by hunger and thirst
 shikaar karne ke liye vah ek talab ke kinare bel-vriksh par padaav banane laga
 Under the vine tree was the Shivling which was covered with villas
 shikari ko uskaa pataa na chalaa
 The twigs he broke while making the halt fell on the Shivling by chance
 is prakaar dinabhar bhukhe-pyaase shikari kaa vrath bhi ho gaya or shivlinga par belptr bhi chadh gaye
 At one o'clock in the night, a pregnant lady came to drink water at the pond
 shikari ne dhanush par tir chadhaakar jyon hi pratyancha khinchi, mrigi boli, 'main garbhini hum
 Will deliver soon tum ek saath do jeevon kii hatya karoge, jo thik nahin he
 i will give birth to a child and will be presented to you soon, then kill it
 ' shikari ne pratyancha dhili kar di or mrigi junglee jhaadiyon main lupt ho gai
 Shortly after, another antelope emerged from there
 shikari kii prasannataa kaa thikaana na rahaa
 After coming close, he put the bow on the arrow
 tab use dekh mrigi ne vinamratapurvak nivedan kiya, 'he pardhi! main thodi der pehle ritu se nivrutt hui hum
 i am lustful
 apane priy kii khoj main bhatak rahi hum
 i will meet my husband and come to you soon
 ' shikari ne use bhi jane diya
 He was perturbed over losing his prey twice
 vah chintaa main pad gaya
 The last hour of the night was passed
 tabhi ek anya mrigi apane bacchon ke saath udhar se nikali
 It was a golden opportunity for hunters
 usne dhanush par tir chadhaane main der nahin lagaai
 He was about to drop the arrow that the antelope said, 'O Pardhi!' i will return these children to their father
 is samay mujhe mat maaro
 The hunter laughed and said, leave the victim in front, i am not such a fool
 isse pehle main do baar apana shikaar kho chukaa hum
 My children must be suffering from hunger and thirst
 uttar main mrigi ne phir kaha, jaise tumhen apane bacchon kii mamata sata rahi he, thik vaise hi mujhe bhi
 Therefore, in the name of children, i am seeking life for a while
 he pardhi! meraa vishwaas kar, main inhen inke pita ke paas chhodkar turant lautne kii pratigya karti hum
 Hearing the deer's low voice, the hunter felt pity on him
 usne us mrigi ko bhi jane diya
 In the absence of hunting, the hunter sitting on the vine tree was being thrown down by breaking the bell-sheet
 pau fatne ko hui to ek hrisht-pusht mrug usee raste par aayaa
 The hunter thought that he would surely hunt it
 shikari kii tani pratyancha dekhakar mrigvinith swar main bolaa, he pardhi bhai! yadi tumne mujhase purv aane vaali teen mrigiyon tathaa chote-chote bacchon ko maar daalaa he, to mujhe bhi maarane main vilamb na karo, taaki mujhe unke viyog main ek kshan bhi dukh na sahanaa pade
 i am the husband of those deer
 yadi tumne unhen jeevandaan diya he to mujhe bhi kuch kshan kaa jivan dene kii krupa karo
 i will meet you and appear before you
 mrug kii baat sunate hi shikari ke saamne puri raat kaa ghatnachakra gum gaya, usne sari katha mrug ko suna di
 Then the deer said, 'the way my three wives have gone as promised, i will not be able to follow my religion with my death
 atah jaise tumne unhen vishwaasapaatr maanakar choda he, vaise hi mujhe bhi jane do
 i will appear before you soon with all of them
 ' upwas, raatri-jaagran tathaa shivlinga par belptr chadhane se shikari kaa hinsak hriday nirmal ho gaya tha
 Bhagavad Shakti was in him
 dhanush tathaa baan uske haath se sahaj hi chhot gaya
 Due to the compassion of Lord Shiva, his violent heart filled with compassionate feelings
 vah apane ateet ke karmon ko yaad karke pashchaatap kii jwaala main jalane laga
 Shortly afterwards, the antelope appeared before the family hunter, so that he could hunt them, but the hunter was very sorry for seeing such veracity, sattvikta and collective love of wild animals
 uske netron se aansuon kii jhadi lag gai
 By not killing that antelope family, the hunter removed his hard heart from living violence and made him soft and kind forever
 devloak se samast dev samaaj bhi is ghatana ko dekh rahe the
 As soon as the event ended, the Gods and Goddesses made flowers
 tab shikari tathaa mrug parivaar moksh ko praapt hue'
 On this occasion, Lord Shiva is consecrated in many ways
 jalabhishek : jal se or dugdhabhishek : doodh se
 Very early in the morning, the temples of Lord Shiva are flooded with devotees, young people and old men who all come to worship the traditional Shivalinga and pray to the Lord
