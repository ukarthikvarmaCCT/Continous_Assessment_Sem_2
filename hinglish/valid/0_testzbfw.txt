 How sexual reproduction originated is a puzzle
 is vishay main kai vyakhyaayein prastut kii gayi hai ki alangik janan se langik janan kyon viksit hua
 Many protists reproduce sexually, as multicellular plants, animals, and fungi
 eukeriotic jeevashm record main, yon prajnan pehali baar 1
2 arab saal pehle proterosoik ion main dikhaai diya tha
 All sexually reproducing eukaryotic organisms possibly originate from a single-celled common ancestor
 yah sambhav he ki sex kaa vikaas pehle eukeriotic cell ke vikaas kaa ek abhinn hissaa tha
 There are some species that have lost this feature for the second time, such as Badaloidea and some parthenocarpic plants
 adhik viksit paudhon main fal or beej dwaara langik janan hota he
 Their flowers consist of male gametes and female gametes, whose conjugates form zygotes
 ye beej ke andar bhrun main viksit ho, ankur banakar nae paudhon ko janm dete hai
 The gametes are very fine and unicellular
 langik janan main do vibhinn janakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Sometimes two gametes of the same type breed together
 aise milan kaa samagam kehete hai
 Fertilization of two different gametes is called
 shaiwal or kavak sadrush nimna shrenee ke paudhon main samagam se janan hota he or ucch shrenee kii vanaspatiyon main nishechan se
 Plants whose gametes do not have a differentiation of male and female are called homozygous and such plants are homozygous
 nishechan main nar or maadaa ke milane se jo banaata he use shukritand, gamit ko assam yugmak or paudhe ko asamayugmiya yaa vividhpushpi kehete hai
 In addition to the above mentioned methods of reproduction, some other methods, such as sterilization, degeneration and desorption are also generated
 praaniyon main langik janan kii kai vidhiyaan hai, jinamein pramukh vidhiyaan hai- In normal sexual reproduction, two germ cells form a zygote
 do jantuon kii utpatti do vibhinn lingon ke janakon main hoti he
 Male sperm are called sperm and female uterus is called egg or egg
 ye janyu vishesh avyavon arthath jandon main utpann hote hai
 Male Janma is called testis and Female Janma is called Ovary
 purvokt donon janyuon ke milan ko sansechan kehete hai
 The impregnation results in the formation of zygote
 yugmajon ke khandikaran se bhrun banataa he or viksit hokar shishu rup main janm letaa he
 The testis is made up of spermatogenesis tubes
 prayek nalika kii ant:bhitti bhruneey apithilium kii bani hoti he, jiske gunan or vibhedikaran se shukranu banate hai
 This process takes place in three stages
 pehla kram gunan avasthaa, doosraa kram vruddhi avasthaa or teesraa kram paripakv avasthaa kaa he
 All cells of the embryonic epithelium are capable of formation, but only a few participate
 ye koshikaaye sutaravibhaajan dwaara jyamitiya anupaat main vibhajit hoti hai
 Cells formed by division are called spermatozoa
 shukranu-koshika-jan bade sookshm hote hai
 They start growing due to the accumulation of nutrients in them
 aisi varghit koshikaon ko praathmik shukranu koshika kehete hai
 They then enter a mature state
 yahan praathmik shukranu koshikaon kaa do baar vibhaajan hota he
 The first division is the meiosis or degradation division
 is vibhaajan ke purv praathmik shukranu koshik ke cendrak main upasthit chromosome kii sankhya dwiguneet hoti he, par ardhasuthran ke samay paitruk chromosome antargranthan dwaara jodon main vyavasthit he jo hai
 In intercorrelations, no two chromosome pairs are formed, but only such chromosome pairs are made of synonyms or synonyms and constructs
 is prakaar ardhasuthran main paitruk chromosomon kii sankhya agunit ho jaati he
 The cells now become second spermatocytes
 dwitiya shukranukoshika kaa ek baar phir vibhaajan hota he jise samasutran kehete hai
 This creates pre-sperm, which slowly transform into sperm
 lakshanik shukranu ke teen bhaag - sir, madhya khand yaa greeva or punch - hote hai
 Different sperm heads have different sizes
 adhikansh ke andakaar, par kis ke chadnuma, kisi ke kaagapench se tede yaa anya prakaar ke bhi hote hai
 They have a sharp forearm or acrosome at the front end
 madhya khand praaia: chota or belanaakaar hota he
 The axilla of the tail remains wrapped in it
 punch tantu ke rup main lambii or kramash: patali hoti jaati he or kashabh kii bhanti gatisheel hoti he
 It moves quickly, causing the sperm to enter the ovum by swimming in semen, or water
 andashay kii koshikaon se andey utpann hote hai
 Eggs also have multiplication stage, growth stage and mature stage
 andashay kii kuch utpaadak koshikaon ke gunan vibhaajan se dimb koshikajan banate hai
 In the cytogens, the ovules collect and grow and grow into the primary ovary
 inkaa phir se hraas vibhaajan hota he or ye do alag alag koshikaon main bant jate hai
 Of these, one is very small and the other is large
 choti ko pratham dhruviya pind ore badi ko dwitiya dimbkoshika kehete hai
 The second ovary has a threading division
 yahan bhi ek choti or duusari badi hoti he
 The large is called the mature or adult egg and the smaller is called the second polar body
 praathmik dhruviya pindon kaa bhi sutaran hokar dhruvakoshika praapt hoti hai
 Polar compositions are useless for reproduction
 ardhabhrun yaa hraas vibhaajan is kaaran aavashyak he ki is prakaar utpann janyuon ke sanyog se jo yugmaj bane unamem paitruk sutron kii sankhya utani hi rahe jitani us jati ke liye aavashyak he, anyathaa santan main paitruk gunon ke badal jane kii sambhaavna ho sakati he
 In order to keep the number of ancestral formulas fixed, their degradation division at the time of zygotic Jagak is necessary
 dimb ke shukranu se milane par hi nae jeev kii utpatti hoti he
 In animals that have sexual reproduction, the egg and sperm are produced in two different sexed animals
 inkaa sayujya nar or maadaa ke milakar sambhog karne se hota he
 At the time of sexual intercourse, the ovum and sperm come close, but Venus's union with the egg, that is, fertilization of the egg depends on many things
 paristhitiyon ke anukool na hone par andey kaa sansechan nahin hota
 The following circumstances are necessary for impregnation: ant: sansechan karanevaale praaniyon main andon kii sankhya bahut kam hoti he or ek baar main ek yaa kuch hi santan utpann hoti he, par jin praaniyon main bahya sansechan hota he, dimb kii sankhya atyadhik hoti he or andon kii apeksha shukranuon kii sankhya to or bhi adhik
 When eggs and sperm are mixed in water, there are many barriers to the zygotes, such as the temperature of the water, its acidity or alkalinity; Speed of water current, presence of other nearby aquatic creatures etc
 at: spishij kii shrinkhalaa banaae rakhane ke liye prakruti dimb or shukranuon kaa utpaadan adhik sankhya main karti he, kyonki in bahusankhyak andon ore shukranuon main se anek andey or shukranu uparyukt kaarnon main se koi bhi pratikul kaaran hene par asansechit avasthaa main mar jate hai
 a egg requires only one sperm for impregnation
 manushya ke ek baar ke maithun main skhlit veery main saamanyat: shukranuon kii sankhya 22,60,00,000 anumaanit kii gai he
 Of these, only one works to store the sperm egg
 prayek dimpotsurg main keval ek hi dimb dimbugranthi se nikalataa he
 As soon as a functioning sperm comes in contact with the egg of its own species, it enters it
 shukranu kaa sir to dimb ke andar ghus jaataa he, kintu uski punch tuutakar baahar hi rah jaati he
 Venus enters the egg and incites many events inside it
 sabase pehle vah dimb main kisi anya shukranu ke pravesh ko roktaa he
 This is how it works: sansechit andey ke bahya str se ek prakaar kaa rasinic srav nikalataa he, jo anya shukranu ko dimb kii ore aakarshith na kar vikarshith karata he athwa dimb ke baahar chaaron ore ek prakaar kii jelly jaisi jhilli ban jaati he, jisase shukranu kaa pravesh nahin ho paata athwa abhedya bhitti se ghira dimb kaa bilkul chota chhed, microple ek shukranu ke pravesh karte hi band ho jaataa he
 Upon insertion into the egg, the sperm meets the centroid of the egg, moving from the stipulated path to the nucleus, and both the sperm and the embryo merge to form chromosomes, which remain independent of the cytoplasm
 dimb ab yugmaj ban jaataa he
 The centrosonome of the egg disappears, but the centrosome of the sperm divides into two, forming a dynamic locus
 is tarku ke ayanvrutt ke chaaron ore chromosamem apni apni jagah le lete hai or sansechit dimbkosh kaa vibhaajan or vikaas shuru hokar bhrun kaa nirmaan hone lagata he
 Considering how the mass of the masses is known, it is found that in most cases, by accident, the male population is accidentally exposed to the floating female mass, but in some conditions the sperm move directly towards the specified target
 iskaa kaaran shukranu kaa kisi vishesh rasinic dravya kii ore aakarshith hona he
 This chemical substance produces egg
 ise rasinic karshan kehete hai
 But there is no chemical traction in every situation
 aisa samajha jaataa he ki nar janyu or maadaa janyu main dhruviya antar hota he, jisase ve paraspar aakarshith hote hai
 What is the real cause of attraction, it cannot be said for sure
 sambhog ke samay maadaa praaia: niskriy rahati he or nar main maadaa ke aalingan ke liye vividh bhanti ke aalingan avyav viksit hote hai
 Some creatures have minor figurative features, such as a beard, a mustache in a human male, and a lack of them in the female but developed breasts and a variety of different colors in sparrows, etc
 yah gaun lakshan gyanendriyon ko prabhavit kar nar tathaa maadaa kaa sanyog karaane main sahaayak hote hai
 Some animals also have some auxiliary components, which are meant to protect the offspring
 anek praaniyon main sansechan ke pashchaat maan-baap kii jimmedaariyaan samaapt ho jaati hai or yugmaj bina kisi dekharekh ke viksit hote hai, kuch praaniyon main bachche apana laalan paalan swayan karte hai, par kuch praaniyon main maan baap apni santan kii raksha kaa bada dhyaan rakhte hai
 They choose a suitable place to protect eggs or embryos
 kuch unako band rakhane kaa upaay bhi karte hai
 For this they manufacture coa
 anya jantuon main andnikshepak hote hai, jinamein ve andey surakshit rakhte hai athwa kisi jivit yaa mrit praani ke utak se ve yahi kaam lete hai
 At the same time, eggs develop and ovules are formed
 kuch praaniyon ke andey yaa dimbh maan yaa baap se chipke rahete hai
 Some parents take them in gills, some in baby bags, such as in crustaceans, some in nectaries, some in dilated ovaries and some in marsupial bags
 kuch praaniyon main dimb or shukranu kaa sanyog mata ke sharir ke andar hi hota he or yugmaj kaa khandikaran evam bhrun kaa vikaas bhi vahiin hota he
 Once the fetus is fully developed, the baby comes out of the mother's womb by delivery
 jitne dinon tak bhrun mata ke garbh main rahata he, utane samay ko garbhakaal kehete hai
 This type of development is called internal development
 kuch machhliyon, chhipakaliyon or pakshiyon main dimb kaa sansechan maithun dwaara maadaa ke sharir ke andar hi hota he or yugmaj athav sansechit dimb churnamay aavaran se mandit hokar sharir ke baahar nikalataa he
 Embryo development takes place outside
 purna viksit ho jane par baccha andey kii kholi ko todakar andey se baahar chalaa aata he
 This type of development is called external development
 machhliyon, medhakon tathaa nimna koti ke anya praaniyon main dimb or shukranu donon hi sharir ke baahar skhlit kiye jate hai or vahiin unka sanyog hota he tathaa andey baahar hi bhrun main viksit hote hai
 In this way, impregnation and development are also external
 gaay, bhens, bakrii, manushya ityadi, jinamein bhrun mata ke sharir ke bheetar parivardhit hota he or shishu jivit avasthaa main baahar nikalataa he, jarayuj kehalaate hai
 Unlike them, fish like frog, snake, lizard and bird, in which babies grow out of eggs, are called eggs
 adhikansh dashaon main bhrun kaa poshan maan ke rakt se, aparaa sadrush kisi sanyojak dwaara hota he
 a similar arrangement is found in some shark fishes, anablabs, some lizards and mammals
 kuch praaniyon main janm ke pashchaat athwa andey se baahar aane par navjaat shishu ko maan-baap bhojan khilaate hai
 Mammals have breasts, from which milk is secreted, this milk is a newborn's diet
 bahuteri chidiyon ke mukh se laar kaa srav hota he, jo chuujon kaa bhojan hota he
 Otherwise the birds swallow the food and put it in the baby's mouth
 sadharantaya vayask honaper janan prarambh hota he, par kuch praaniyon main jaise mizes or akzolatal main shishav avasthaa main hi janan prarambh ho jaataa he
 This is called asechan generation
 adhikansh praaniyon yaa paudhon kii jananritu, praaia: nishchit hoti he, dimb kaa vikaas ritu or vaataavaran par nirbhar karata he
 Many birds, insects and other animals have high reproductive activity in spring or summer season
 vaataavaran kii sthiti, taap, ardrata, shushkta ityadi sharirkriya ko prabhavit karti hai or inkaa prabhaav janan par bhi padataa he
 Reproduction is closely related to food
 jahaan vaataavaran ek sa rahata he, vahaan ke praaniyon main ritukal nishchit nahin hota, jaise philipine dwipon main jalwaayu kii paristhitiyon se hi kuch praaniyon kaa pravasan hota he or sahaayak jananendriyon main samayik, bahya yaa ant:parivartan hote hai
 In some animals, reproduction goes on throughout life, but in some, with the increase of age, the reproductive function becomes slow or stops altogether
 adhikansh praaniyon main janankriyasheeltaa ke bad vishram kaal aata he or uske baad phir ritukal aarambh hota he
 This sequence happens in series or alternately
 ucch koti ke praaniyon main, jinamein manushya bhi aata he, garam hona, raj:srav athwa andanu utpaadan bhi krambaddh hote hai
 There are some glands in the body of animals, which have no duct
 in grathiyon se hormone banate hai, jo sidhe rakt main chale jate hai
 These circulate throughout the body along with the bloodstream and produce different effects on the body
 ye kuch angon ko uddipt karte or kuch kaa daman karte hai
 Among them, the pituitary gland and the gonad have a very dense relationship with reproduction
 kuch praaniyon main nar jananendriya or nari jananendrit donon hoti hai tathaa shukranu or andey ek hi praani main utpann hote hai
 They are bisexual beings
 inamen yaa to ek hi prakaar ke chromosome andar hi paraspar milakar janan karte hai, jise swayansesechan kehete hai, athwa do ubhayalingi jode khaakar paraspar ek duusare ke andey kaa sansechan karte hai, jise swayansansechan kehete hai, athwa do ubhayalingi jode khaakar paraspar ek duusare ke andey kaa sansechan karte hai, jise 'cross' kehete hai
 Ketchus, leeches, snails and hydra are examples of the previous type
 swayansansechan birla hi paaya jaataa he
 It does not have to be a combination of eggs and Venus
 ise akshatyounik janan bhi kehete hai
 Examples of this are bees and aphids
 madhumakhiyaan kuch sansechit or kuch asansechit yaa agarbhit andey detii hai
 Workless and queen bees are produced from uncultivated eggs, and drones or male bees are produced from uncultivated eggs
 kuch saamudrik praaniyon, jaise si archin main bhi asansechit andey se nae praani kaa utpaadan vaigyanikon ne sambhav kiya he
 Bangchi has been produced by adopting a frog's egg with a needle and developing it
 is prakaar bhautik or rasinic vidhiyon se bhi andey ko viksit hone ke liy safaltaapurvak prerit kiya gaya he
 The liver worm and the tiger salamander have an unusual pattern of reproduction, called ovulation
 isamen jab praani dimbhavstha main hi rahete hai or purna vayask nahin hue rahete tabhi janan karne lagate hai or santanvruddhi karte hai

 The theory of relativity or relativity, or just relativity, is a fundamental theory of modern physics developed by Albert Einstein and has two major parts - specific relativity and general relativity
 phir bhi kai baar aapekshikta yaa relativity shabd ko gallilian invariens ke sandarbh main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term, called Theory of Relativity, was first used by Max Planck in 1906
 yah angrezi shabd samooh "relative theory" se liya gaya tha jisamen yah bataaya gaya he ki kaise yah siddhant principal of relativity kaa prayog karata he
 In the discussion section of this paper, Alfred Booker used "theory of Relativity" for the first time
 aapekshikta siddhant sankshep main yah he ki 'nirpeksh' gati tathaa 'nirpeksh' twaran kaa astitv asambhav he, arthath 'nirpeksh gati' evam 'nirpeksh twaran' shabd vastut: nirarthak hai
 If 'absolute motion' had meaning, then it could be certain without referring to other bodies
 parantu sab prakaar se cheshtaa karne par bhi kisi pind kii 'nirpeksh' gati kaa pataa nishchit rup se prayog dwaara pramanit nahin ho sakaa he or ab to aapekshikta siddhant bataata he ki aisa nishchit karnaa asambhav he
 a new approach in physics started with relativity theory
 aapekshikta siddhant ke aane se bhautikee ke katipay puraane siddhanton kaa drudh sthaan dig gaya or anek moulik kalpanaaon ke vishay main sookshm vichaar karne kii aavashyaktaa dikhaai dene lagi
 In science, the function of theory is often to systematically formulate known fruits and then to test new fruits from that theory by experiment
 aapekshikta siddhant in donon kaaryon main safal rahaa he
 By the end of the 19th century, physics was developing according to Newton-inspired theories
 prayek nae avishkaar athwa praayogic fal ko in siddhanton ke drushtikon se dekha jaataa tha or aavashyak nai pariklpanaayen banaai jaati thim
 Among them, the ubiquitous ether had a distinctive place
 ether ke astitv kii kalpana karne ke do pramukh kaaran the
 Firstly, a medium like ether was required for the vibration of electromagnetic waves to propagate from one place to another
 dwitiya, yantriki main newton ke gati vishyak samikarnon ke liye, or jis parshwabhoomi par ye sameekaran aadhaarit the uske liye bhi, ek pramanik nirdeshak kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Specific properties were applied to the ether to accurately assess the fruits of the experiments
 ether sarvyaapee samajha jaataa tha or sampurna dishaao main tathaa pindon main bhi uskaa astitv mana jaataa tha
 In this stable ether, objects could travel without resistance, it was imagined
 in gunon ke kaaran ether ko nirpeksh maanak samajhane main koi baadha nahin thi
 Light speed 3x108 m
 Per second, it was known and waves of light are radiated at this speed relative to 'stationary' ether, it was imagined
 yantriki main veg, twaran, bal ityadi ke liye bhi ether nirpeksh maanak samajha jaataa tha
 In the second half of the 19th century, many attempts were made to experiment with the existence of ether and to establish its properties
 inamen micelsonmorle kaa prayog vishesh mahatvapurn tathaa ullekhneey he
 The purpose of this experiment was to make an accurate measurement of the speed at which the Earth revolves around the Sun with the ether
 kintu yah praytn asafal rahaa or prayog ke fal se yah anumaan nikaala gaya ki ether ke saapeksh prithvi kii gati shunya he
 It also means that the imagery of ether is untrue, that is, ether does not exist
 yadi ether hi nahin he to nirpeksh maanak kaa bhi astitv nahin ho saktaa
 Thus, the motion can only be relative
 bhautikee main saamanyat: gati kaa maapan karne ke liye athwa fal vyakt karne ke liye kisi bhi ek paddati kaa nirdesh dekar kaary kiya jaataa he
 But in these instructional methods, no method can be 'specific', because if it were, then we could consider that 'specific' instructional method as the standard of relaxation
 anek prayogon se aisa hi fal praapt hua
 The fruits of these experiments created serious disturbance not only in physics, but also in science and philosophy
 20veen shatabdi ke prarambh main prasiddh french ganitagya ech
 poincare ne aapekshikta kaa pranium prastut kiya
 According to them the laws of physics should be expressed in such a form that they are real to any observer
 iskaa arth yah he ki bhautikee ke niyam prekshak kii gati ke upar avlambit na rahen
 This act sheds new light on the prevailing conceptions of pain and time
 is vishay main oinstin kii vichaardhaara, yadhyapi vah krantikaarak thi, prayogon ke falon ko samajhane main adhik safal rahi
 Einstein made special analysis of the fundamental words and the prevailing conceptions combined with them, such as speed, acceleration, acceleration, time, etc
 is vishleshan se yah spasht hua ki newton ke siddhanton par aadhaarit tathaa pratishthit bhautikee main trutiyaan hai
 Einstein's theory of relativity is two categories: vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main bhautikee ke niyam is swaroop main vyakt hote hai ki ve kisi bhi atwarit prekshak ke liye samaan honge
 In the general relativity theory, the laws of physics are expressed in such a way that they will be independent or unrestrained by the motion of the observer
 vishisht aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1905 main hua or saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa vikaas 1915 main hua
 It was presented by Einstein in 1905 in one of his papers on the electrodynamics of moving bodies
 vishisht saapekshata do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he jo shastreey yantriki ke sankalpanaaon ke viruddh hai: The results from the theory of specific relativity are surprising; Some of these are as follows: shastreey yantriki main galileo kaa roopaantaran prayukt hota he jabaki vishisht saapekshata main lorents roopantaran 
 The theory of relativity developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1911 is known as 'general Relativity'
 yah siddhanth nimnlikhit do pariklpanaaon par aadhaarit he- Specific relativity theory improved the assumptions made in physics about length, distance, time, mass, energy, etc
 inke atirikt bhautikee ke kshetra main anya vishay hai jo utane hi mahatvapurn hai, kintu unka samavesh vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main nahin he
 The specific relativity principle can be used in force and electromagnetic fields, as it cannot in the gravitational field
 gurutvkarshan bhautikee kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn vibhaag he, at: spasht he ki vishisht aapekshikta siddhant ko vyapak banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The relation of mass comes in two ways in physics
 kisi pind par jab bal kaary karata he tab pind kaa sthaan badalata he or uskaa veg badalata he
 The body gets acceleration as long as the force acts
 yantriki ke niyamon ke anusaar bal, pind kaa dravyaman or twaran main nimnlikhit sambandh he : The mass m in this equation is called inertia or dependent mass
 dravyaman kaa doosraa sambandh newton ke guruttviya kshetra main aata he
 According to Newton's theory of gravity, if two masses, m1 and m2, are at a distance r, the following gravitational force f will work between them: is sameekaran main g gurutvkarshan sthiraank he
 If we consider m1 as the mass of the earth and m2 as the mass of another body near the earth, the equation will express the mass m2
 newton kii yantriki main gativigyaan tathaa gurutvkarshan swatantra or bhinn hai, kintu donon main hi dravyaman kaa sambandh aata he
 Einstein integrated the concepts used in these two independent and different divisions of the mass into his general relativity theory
 yah gyaat tha ki jadtv par ashrith dravyaman or gurutveey dravyaman samaan hote hai
 Einstein used this analogy of mass to harmonize kinetics and gravity, and in 1915 AD introduced a comprehensive relativity theory
 saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant ko ganit main sutrit karne kii jo paddati he vah anya paddatiyon se bhinn he
 It uses special geometry, which is different from Euclid's three-dimensional geometry
 ] ne yah bataaya ki yadi vishisht aapekshikta siddhant main dik ke teen aayam tathaa samay kaa chaturth aayam, in chaaron ayaamon ko lekar ek 'chaturaayam satati', kii kalpana kii jaae to aapekshikta siddhant adhik saral ho jaataa he
 Symmetry is not absolute - it has been proved
 isse newton pranit dik tathaa samay kii nirpekshata or swatantraaa samaapt ho jaati he
 Therefore, to express physical phenomena, the quadrant of time and time is more natural
 riman ne 'chaturaayam dik' kii kalpana karke uski jyamiti kaa jo vikaas kiya tha uskaa oinstin ne adhik upyog kiya
 In this quadrant of time and time, the principles of physics were geometrically placed in the general relativity theory
 is chaturaayam satati kaa yuclid ke teen aayam ke dik se samya he
 In the reality of three dimensions, just as a point or a place is determined by these three coordinates, the length between two points and one is also fixed
 chaturaayam satati main dik ke in teen ayaamon ke saath jab samay bhi joda jaataa he tab samay kaa aayam rup t = x0
5c-1 aata he, jahaan t = samay or c = prakaash kaa veg he
 If one observer specifies a world event, then the speed relative to that observer will be the coordinates of the same event for another observer
 lorenz ke roopantaran ke niyam yadi yatharth hon to siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki By developing the equation, similar but highly complex terms are found for any type of motion
 iske liye nishchalon or pradishon ke siddhanton kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Gravity naturally occurs in the wider relativity theory by expanding the original imaginations in this way
 uske liye vishisht pariklpanaaon kii aavashyaktaa nahin haati he
 The results of many events are the same, according to Einstein's pervasive relativity theory and Newton's pioneering mechanics
 kintu khagoliki main jab saamaanya aapekshikta siddhant kaa upyog kiya gaya tab teen ghatnaon ke fal pratishthit yantriki ke anusaar nikle falon se kuch bhinn rahe
 From these fruits one can take the test of general relativity theory
 ye teen fal is prakaar hai: Process is an indicator of speed
 kisi bhi vastu kii aantarik banaavat main bhinnata aana parivartan he
 When one state is definitely moving towards another, then that motion is called process
 is arth main jeev kii amoeba se maanav tak aane vaali gati, bhuprastaran kii kriyaayein tathaa taral padaarth kaa vaashp main aana prakram ke suchak hai
 The process gives a sense of speed that can be sustained for some time
 saamaanya jagat main jad or chetan, padaarth or jeev main aane vaale aise parivartan prakram ke dyotak hai
 Thus, the word process is used in a broader sense
 prakram ke is mul granth ke upyog saamaajik jivan ke samajhane ke liye kiya gaya he
 The word social refers to a behavior that expresses the interrelationship of more than one living being, which means collective rather than private, which is recognized by a group, and thus its meaning is also collective
 ek samaaj main kai prakaar ke samooh ho sakate hai jo ek yaa anek dishaao main maanav vyavhaar ko prabhavit karen
 In this sense, social process is the process by which any unit or group of social system or social action is definitely in motion to move from one state to another for some time
 ek drushti se vishisht disha main hone vaale parivartan saamaajik vyavastha ke ek bhaag ke antargat dekhe ja sakate hai tathaa duusari se saamaajik vyavastha ke drushtikon se
 The first type of change has three forms: aakaar ke aadhaar par sankhyatmak rup se paribhaashit - jansankhya kii vruddhi, ek sthaan par kuch vastuon kaa pehle se adhik sankhya main ekatra hona, jaise anaaj kii mandi main baiylgaadiyon yaa graahakon kaa din chadhane ke saath badhanaa, iske udhaaharan hai
 mceshwar has not given examples in the opposite direction, but the evening of the market ends, many people gather from the outer part to the inner parts by buses or trains and immerse in the evening between 8 and 10 o'clock in the big city
 Such examples are
 akaal tathaa mahamari ke failane se janahani bhi isi prakaar ke prakram ke dyotak hai
 Changes in quality from structural and functional point of view - The emergence or disappearance of internal traits in any social unit are indicative of this type of process
 janatantr ke lakshanon kaa laghu rup se purnataa kii ore badhanaa aisa hi prakram he
 The growth of a small town as a city, the primary school as a secondary and higher school, the small temple or the state of the sanctuary are examples of development
 vikaas kii kriya se aashay un gunon kii abhivruddhi se he jo ek avasthaa main laghu rup se duusari avasthaa main vrihat tathaa adhik gunsampann sthiti ko praapt hue hai
 This growth is not only in the number or size, but the internal qualities
 is bhanti kii vruddhi sanrachana main hoti he or kriyaaon main bhi
 In England, there has been continuity in the growth of the quality of Prime Minister and Parliament
 is vikaas kii do dishaaen thim
 They can be seen from any direction
 bharat main congress kaa udai or swatantraaa kii prapti ek ore tathaa british sarkaar kaa nirantar shaktiheen hona duusari ore isi rup se dekha ja saktaa he
 The social processes clarify the state of development and depletion, unless an attempt is made to attribute the new-coming virtuous stage in social development to the preceding stage
 nishchit maryaadaaon ke aadhaar par lakshyon kaa parivartan - jab ek avasthaa se duusari avasthaa kii ore janaa saamaajik rup se sweekrut vaa shrey mana jaae to us prakaar kaa prakram unnati yaa pragati kaa rup liye hota he or jab saamaajik manyataayen parivartan dwaara laai jane vaali disha ko hin drushti se dekhen to use patan yaa vilom hone kii prakriya kaha jayega
 In Russia, the steps leading to communism will be considered progressive, the steps which increase the state power in America will reach the definition of decadence, the food of the Shudra people in the Brahmin varna signifies the progress in the beliefs of the socialist program and the traditional systems
 Symptoms of degeneration according to
 kuch vyavasthaayen es samay kii manyataon ke anusaar shreyaskar ho sakati hai or duusare samay main unhen tiraskaar kii drushti se dekha ja saktaa he
 Emotions were rooted in Rome on the basis of changes in the system of gladiators, or slavery in ancient times
 samaaj main vibhinn varg yaa samooh hote hai, unase manyataayen nirdhaarit hoti hai
 The beliefs of a group are sometimes consistent with the whole society
 kabhi-kabhi ve vipareet dishaao main bhi jaati hai or unheen ke anusaar vibhinn saamaajik parivartanon kaa moolyankan shrey vaa hey dishaao main kiya ja saktaa he
 Until social values change themselves, they continue to define changes for a long time
 duusare prakaar ke saamaajik prakram apane se baahar kintu kisi saamaanya vyavastha ke ang ke rup main santulan karne yaa badhane kii drushti se dekhe ja sakate hai
 Social changes come in the characteristic of an organization, many times the entire social system of that institution or the relationship made with other departments changes
 pehle ke santulan ghat-bad jate hai or kisi bhi disha main prakram chaalu ho jate hai
 As the families become smaller, as a result of the decline of the joint family, the relationship of older persons with family or village is seen to be changing
 samantshahi ke sadrudh sambandh ekaek us yug ke pramukh vyaktiyon ke liye ek nai samasya lekar aae hai
 The basic element of understanding changes like this is in comparing the balance of the former state of one part of society with the problems of the new stage
 is prakaar ke parivartan santulan badhaane yaa ghataane vaale ho sakate hai
 The balance of one limb can be seen from other organs
 do vyakti yaa samooh jab ek hi lakshya kii prapti ke liye sweekrut sadhano ke upyog dwaara praytn karte hai to yah kriya pratiyogita kehalaati he
 In this, the means of achieving goals are common
 kabhi-kabhi niyamavali tak prakashit ho jaati he
 Olympic sports and different types of sports competitions are indicative of this
 pariksha ke niyamon ke antargat pratham sthaan praapt karnaa doosraa udhaaharan he
 When attempts are made to break the rules, or to disregard them, by trying to harm the opposition beyond the rules, they will be called conflicts
 raajnneetik dalon main pratiyogita mul niyamon ko sadrudh banaati hai; unamem hone vaale sangharsh niyamon ko hi ksheen banaate hai or is prakaar avyavashtha failaate hai
 Sometimes small conflicts lead to greater unity
 bahari akraman ke samay bhitari sanghathan kai baar ek ho jate hai, kabhi-kabhi aisa kuvyavastha jad pakad leti he ki use saadhaaran se pare dhang se bhi nahin hataaya ja saktaa
 It is not necessary that the outcome of the struggle will always be in the interest of society, but in that process, effective steps that take place in addition to the rules, are definitely done
 ek samaaj yaa samskruti kaa duusare samaaj yaa samskruti se jab muqabla hota he to kai baar ek ke tatv duusare main tathaa duusare ke pehle main aane lagate hai
 Elements of culture like this are mostly eclipsed at limited and selected sites
 naashte main angrejon se chaay grahan kar lee gai par makkhan nahin; ghadiyon kaa upyog badha par samay par kaam karne kii aadat utani vyapak nahin hui; kursiyon par palathi maar kar baithna tathaa naukari dilaane main jati ko yaad karnaa isi prakaar ke parivartan hai
 There are some rules and restrictions with the use of goods in the society, some beliefs and methods and some usefulness
 ek vastu kaa jo sthaan ek samaaj me he, uskaa vahi sthaan in sabhi binduon par duusare samaaj main ho jaae yah aavashyak nahin
 In India, the use of motor and telephone is as a measure of respect, whereas in the US, it is only a convenience; Atomic bombs are the basis of defense in some countries, reputations in some
 is bhanti samskruti kaa prasar samaaj kii aavashyaktaaon, manyataon tathaa saamaajik sanrachana dwaara prabhavit ho jaataa he
 In this process, only a few characteristics of new systems and things are taken
 ise angreji main eklchareshan kaha gaya he
 When partial inclusion of a new object is made in culture, that fraction is expressed by this word
 jab kisi samskruti ke tatv ko purnroopen nai samskruti main samavisht kar liya jaae tab us prakriya ko acemilation kaha jaataa he
 This word is understood that the characteristic or object received has become part of the culture in this form, as if its origin has never been foreign
 aaj ke rup main vah samskruti kaa itnaa abhinn ang ban gaya he ki uske aagaman kaa strot dekhne kii aavashyaktaa kaa maan tak nahin ho saktaa
 The nature of the Hindi dialect is as natural in the Hindi-speaking state today as the use of potato or tobacco for them
 bharat main shaq, hun or sithian tatwon kaa itnaa samavesh ho chukaa he ki unka pruthak astitv dekhnaa hi maano nirarthak ho gaya he
 In a language, words of other languages make their way in this way, such as Pandit's inclusion in English or Rail Motor in Hindi
 bahari vyavastha se praapt tatv jab abhinn rup se aantarik vyavastha kaa bhaag ban jaataa he tab us prakram ko aatmikaran kaha jaataa he
 When different parts of the same society continue to contribute to maintaining the social order by supporting each other, that process is called integration
 is prakaar ke samaaj kii thos rachana kai baar samaaj ko balvan banaate hue nae vichaaron se viheen bana detii he
 The only concrete arrangement between continual new changes loses balance in itself
 at: apekshit he ki jivit saamaajik vyavastha apane andar un prakriyaaon ko bhi protsaahan he, jinase nai avasthaaon ke liye nae santulan ban saken; is drushti se purna sangathit samaaj swayan main kamajori liye hota he
 Some imbalances are necessary in a dynamic society, but the main thing to be seen is that in which health processes in the new equilibrium and problem solving processes go on regularly
 prayek samaaj main sahyog evam sangharsh kii prakriyaayein sadaa chalate hai
 Processes of cooperation and conflict are always going on in every society and maintaining order among them is such a problem for the survival of every society that it is necessary to try to solve it
 brijabhoomi shiv kumaar dwaara banaaya gaya ek brajabhasha chalchitr he jo varsh 1982 main pradarshit hua tha

 ganga dashahra hinduon kaa ek pramukh tyohaar he
 Jyeshtha Shukla Dashami is called Dussehra
 isamen snaan, daan, roopaatmak vrath hota he
 It is written in Skandpuran that, Jyeshtha Shukla Dashami is considered to be Samvatsarmukhi, especially bathe in it and make donations
 kisi bhi nadi par jaakar arghya evam tilodak avashya karen
 One who does this is absolved of ten sins equal to the superpowers
 yadi jyeshtha shukla dashami ke din mangalvaar rahata ho va hast nakshatra yuta tithi ho yah sab paapon ke harne vaali hoti he
 It is written in the Varaha Purana that, in Jyeshtha Shukla Dashami Budhwari, the best river was incarnated from heaven in the hand constellation, it destroys ten sins
 is kaaran us tithi ko dashahra kehete hai
 Jyeshtha month, Shukla paksha, Wednesday, Hasta nakshatra, Gar, Ananda, Vyapitapat, Moon of Virgo, Sun of Taurus, in these ten yogas, a person takes a bath and gets rid of all sins
 bhavishya puraana main likhaa hua he ki, jo manushya is dashahra ke din ganga ke pani main khadaa hokar das baar is stotra ko padhata he chaahe wo daridr ho, chaahe asamarth ho vah bhi prayatnpurvak ganga kii puja kar us fal ko paata he
 This method of bathing on the day of Dussehra was completed
 skanda puraana kaa kaha hua dashahra naam kaa ganga stotra or uske padhane kii vidhi - sab avyavon se sundar teen netron vaali chaturbhuji jiske ki, chaaron bhuj, ratnakumbh, shwetkamal, varad or abhaya se sushobhit hai, safed vastra pahane hui he

 ' namo bhagavti hili hili mili mili gange maan pavay pavay swaha' yah gangaji kaa mantra he
 This means, o Goddess Gange! Get me again and again, consecrate, sanctify, dedicate panchachar and wreath for Ganga ji
 is prakaar ganga kaa dhyaan or pujan karke ganga ke pani main khadey hokar adhya ityadi se sankalp karen ki, aise-aise samay jyeshtha maas ke shukla paksh main pratipada se lekar dashami tak roj-roj ek badhaate hue sab paapon ko nasht karne ke liye ganga stotra kaa jap karunga
 The hymn should be read at the back
 ishwar bole ki, aanandrupini anand ke dene vaali ganga ke liye barambar namaskara he
 There are frequent salutations to Vishnurupini and to you Brahma idol
 
 1
 
 For you Rudraparupini and for Shankari is the repeated salutation, the Bheshaj idol is all hello to you, all the Dev Swaroopini
 
 2
 
 Salutations to the Ganges that destroy the poison of the world and raise the dead; Salutations to the Ganges, which eradicate all three temperatures
 
 4
 
 Murti, salutations to you Ganga, you who destroy all the sins of purification, like you
 
 5
 
 Bhogavati to you, the Ganges, giving bhakti, mukti, bhadra, enjoyment and consumptions

 Repeated salutations to Deve Vali for you Mandakini, Bhushan Swarupa of all the three worlds and repeated greetings to those who belong to the three sects
 koi is shloke main 'tripathayai' iske sthaan main 'jagaddhatraiya' aisa paath karte hai
 This means a hello to the spirit of the world
 
 7
 
 Frequent salutations to the three Shukla Sansthavalis and to Kshavati are salutations to Tejowati, the three-edged Sanstha, salutations to Linga Nanda Nanda and salutations to the ill-fated soul of nectar

 23
 
 On the day of Dashmi, whoever stands in the Ganges water and recites this hymn ten times, who is poor or unable
 
 24
 
 If he worships Gangaji diligently, he also gets the same fruit as what was said from the first legislation
 
 25
 
 As Gauri is like Ganga ji, this is why the method stated in the worship of Gauri is the same method as in worshiping Ganga
 
 26
 
 Just as Shiva likewise reveals the distinction between Vishnu and Shiva and between Sri and Gauri and between Ganga and Gauri is utterly foolish

 mithyaa kaa abhinivesh ye teen tarah kaa man kaa paap, in dason tarah ke paapon ko he gange aap dur kar den
 32
 
 It defeats ten sins, hence it is also called Dussehra, due to these ten types of sins
 
 33
 
 There is no doubt about it
 he gadadhar! yah satya he, satya he, isamen sanshay nahin he ! yadi is mantra se ganga kaa pujan kara diya to teenon ke das, tees or sau pitaron ko sansar se ubaarti he

 gir vanyajeev abhayaarany bharat ke gujarat main rajya sthit rashtriya udyaan evam vanyapraani abhayaarany he, jo asia main singhon kaa ekmaatr nivas sthaan hone ke kaaran janaa jaataa he
 The Gir Sanctuary is spread over 1424 sq km, with a national park of 258 sq km and an extension of 1153 sq km reserved for wildlife
 iske atirikt paas main hi mitiyala vanyajeev abhayaarany he jo 18
22 kilometre main failaa hua he
 Both these reserved expansions are part of Junagadh, Amreli and Gir Somnath districts in Gujarat
 singhdarshan ke liye ye udyaan evam abhayaarany vishwa main pravaasiyon ke liye aakarshan kaa centre he
 In order to deal with the problem of decreasing number of lions in the world and to protect the Asiatic lions, this expansion was declared as the only habitat of lions
 vishwa main africa ke baad isi vistaar main singh bache hai
 The Gir forest was declared as a Wildlife Sanctuary in 1969 and six years later it was expanded to 140
4 square kilometers and established as a national park
 yah abhyaarany ab lagbhag 258
71 varg kilometre tak vistrut ho chukaa he
 As a result of many efforts to provide protection to wildlife, the number of lions in this sanctuary has increased to 312 now
 gir vanyajeev abhayaarany kaa itihaas 100 saalon se adhik purana he or isaki purvabhumika pracheen itihaas ke saath sambandh rakhti he

 Some people in India also keep their surname as Singh
 singh ko shaury or veerta kaa pratik mana jaataa he
 Due to the problems of hunting of lions, cutting of forests, lack of suitable environment for lions, problems of water and food, the lion species gradually started disappearing from India
 bharat main gir ke alaava anya vistaar main jivit haalat main singh isvisan 1984 main paaya gaya tha, jiskaa ullekh darj kiya gaya he
 Probably lions became extinct around 1840 in Bihar, 1885 in eastern Vindhyas and Bundelkhand, 1834 in Delhi, 1842 in Bhawalpur, 1870 in Central India and Rajasthan and 1880 in western extension

 At 6:30 pm EST Kennedy called a meeting of nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisors, after the fact of the October 22 of the National Security Action Memorandum 196, he formally named the Executive Committee of the National Security Council into a group
 Declared
 america ke paas darasal koi yojana nahin thi, kyonki america khufia vibhaag aashwast tha ki soviet sangh kabhi bhi cuba main parmaanu prakshepastra nahin lagayegaa
 exom ne shighrata se paanch sambhavit karrwai ke kramon par charchaa kii: The Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously agreed that a full-scale attack and intervention is the only solution
 unka maananaa tha ki cuba par vijay praapt karne se yues ko rokane kaa prayaas soviet sangh nahin karegaa
 Kennedy was confused
 They, no more than we, can let these things go by without doing something
 They can't, after all their statements, permit us to take out their missiles, kill a lot of Russians, and then do nothing
 If they don't take action in Cuba, they certainly will in Berlin
 Kennedy thought that airstrikes on Cuba would lead the Soviets to believe that a signal of "a green signal" had been given to subjugate Berlin
 kennedy kaa yah bhi maananaa tha ki america ke sahyogi yah sochenge ki cuba sthiti kaa shantipurna samaadhaan nahin nikaal paane ke kaaran "yuddh-premi coubwoy" ke rup main berlin ne yues ko ganvaa diya
 : 332 tab exom ne shakti ke samrik santulan, raajnneetik or sainik donon par padane vaale prabhaav par charchaa kii
 The Joint Chiefs of Staff believed the missiles would severely change the military balance, but Defense Secretary Robert mcnamara disagreed
 He was sure that the missiles would not affect the strategic balance at all
 He said that the extra forty would not affect the overall strategic balance
 The US already had about 5,000 strategic explosive heads, while the Soviet Union had only 300
:261, he said, so the strategic balance was not going to change fundamentally as the Soviet Union had 340
 In 1990 he reiterated that "it did not make any difference
" 

sainya santulan nahin badla tha
 i still didn't believe and i still don't
 " exom sahamat tha, haalanki, mixilon se raajnneetik santulan prabhavit ho rahaa tha
 First, Kennedy made a clear promise to the American public a month before the crisis that "if endowed with the capacity to take aggressive action against America
" 

to america karrwai karegaa,":674-681 duusare, uske sahyogiyon or america janata ke bich yues kii vishwasaneeyata ko kshati pahonchegi, agar ve cuba main missile lagane ke jariye samrik santulan ko badalata dikhaane kii soviet sangh ko ijaajat dete hai
 After the crisis, Kennedy said that "this would have changed the balance of power politically
 There was an impression and that perception contributed to reality
" ":889-904 On Thursday, October 18, President Kennedy met Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromico, who claimed that the weapons were for defensive purposes only
 unhen jis baat kii pehle se jaankaree thi ve use prakat karnaa nahin chaahate the or ve america janata main ghabrahat failaana nahin chaahate the, so raashtrapati ne missile taiyaari kii apni jaankaree ko saarvajanik nahin kiya

 Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Anderson wrote a position document that helped Kennedy differentiate between the quarantine of offensive weapons and the blockade of all materials, indicating that a conventional blockade was not originally intended
 chunki yah antarrashtriya jal main hone vaala tha, isliye raashtrapati kennedy rio sandhi ke golarddh raksha praavdhaanon ke tahat sainya karrwai karne ke liye oees se anumodan praapt kiya
 Latin American participation in the quarantine now involved two Argentine destroyers which were to report to the US Commander South Atlantic at Trinidad on 9 November
 An Argentine submarine and a Marine battalion with lift were available if required
 In addition, two Venezuelan destroyers and one submarine had reported to COSOLANT, ready for sea by November 2
 The Government of Trinidad and Tobago offered the use of Chaguaramas Naval Base to warships of any OAS nation for the duration of the quarantine
 The Dominican Republic had made available one escort ship
 Colombia was reported ready to furnish units and had sent military officers to the US to discuss this assistance
 The Argentine Air Force informally offered three SA-16 aircraft in addition to forces already committed to the quarantine operation
 This initially was to involve a naval blockade against offensive weapons within the framework of the Organization of American States and the Rio Treaty
 Such a blockade might be expanded to cover all types of goods and air transport
 The action was to be backed up by surveillance of Cuba
 The cno's scenario was followed closely in later implementing the quarantine
 On 19 October, Exom formed a separate working group to investigate airstrikes and blockade options, and by noon most of Exom's blockade was in favor

 kennedy ne prashasan kii yojana ko varnit kiya: To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated
 All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation and port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back
 This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers
 We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948

 While a new message from Khrushchev began to arrive at 11:03 am EST while the meeting was going on, part of the message said, You are disturbed over Cuba
 You say that this disturbs you because it is ninety miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America
 But


 you have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Italy and Turkey, literally next to us


 i therefore make this proposal: We are willing to remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive

 kennedy ne pehle hi kah diya tha ki agar hamalaa hua to ve un sthalon par hamale kaa aadesh denge, lekin unhone tay kiya ki ve aisa tab tak nahin karenge jab tak ki duusari baar hamalaa nahin hota
 After 40 years, mcnamara said in an interview: We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational
 We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that—the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did—we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict
 And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we wouldn't meet, we'd simply attack
 It was shot down on Friday 
 Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought "well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack
" Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation
 And therefore, he issued orders to Pliyev, the Soviet commander in Cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the U-2

 Fomin and Scally reunite at Juan Brito's request
 scally ne poocha ki khrushchev ke do patr itane alag kyon hai, to fomin ne daawa diya ki "kharaab sampreshan" ke kaaran aisa hua hoga
 Scally replied that the claim was not credible and shouted that he thought it was "a useless deception"
 They went on to say that the invasion was now only a matter of a few hours, at which point Fomin said that Khrushchev was expected to respond to the US message and asked Skalie to tell the State Department Urged that there was no intention of deceit
 scally ne kaha ki unhen nahin lagata ki koi is par vishwaas karegaa, lekin ve sandesh de dene ke liye sahamat ho gaye

 In his agreement with the US Attorney General Robert Kennedy, the Soviet Ambassador Antoine Dobranin informally proposed that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey be lifted "within a few days of the end of the crisis"
: 222 Last US The missiles were disassembled by 24 April 1963, and were sent out of Turkey shortly thereafter

 It is possible that Khrushchev had placed missiles in Cuba only to have Kennedy withdraw missiles from Italy and Turkey, while the Soviets had no intention of going to the asylum of nuclear war; Provided they are shot and killed by Americans
 However, since the withdrawal of Jupiter missiles from NATO bases in southern Italy and Turkey was not made public at the time, Khrushchev appeared to be losing the conflict and weakened
 dharna yah bani ki mahashaktiyon ke bich kii ladaai main kennedy jeet gaye or khrushchev apamaanit ho gaye
 However, this case is not entirely correct as both Kennedy and Khrushchev took every step to avert complete conflict despite pressure from their own governments
 Khrushchev remained in power for the next two years
 :102-105 The agreement was particularly embarrassing for Khrushchev and the Soviet Union, as the withdrawal of American missiles from Italy and Turkey was not made public - it was a secret agreement between Kennedy and Khrushchev

 Two years after Khrushchev withdrew from power, he may have had a partial stake in the Politburo's embarrassment, both for his potential concession to the US and his inability to be oblivious to the crisis at the right time
 haalanki, cuba missile sankat khrushchev ke patan ke liye akele jimmedaar nahin tha

 Historian and John F
 Kennedy's counselor Arthur Schlesinger said in an interview on National Public Radio on 16 October 2002 that Castro did not want the missiles, but it was Khrushchev who pressured Castro for this
 kastro is vichaar se puri tarah se khush nahin the, lekin cuba ko yues ke hamale se bachaane ke liye or apane sahyogi soviet union kii madad karne ke liye cuban neshnal directret of da revalushan ko unhone sweekaar kiya
 : 272 Schlesinger believed that Castro would have been more angry with Khrushchev if the missiles had been removed, and would have been with Kennedy then, since Khrushchev had not consulted with Castro before deciding to remove them

 a thermometer or a thermometer or a thermometer or hydrometer is a device by which the density of liquids can be read without calculation
 in yantron kii ore vaigyanikon kaa dhyaan atyant pracheen samay se tha or is baat ke pramaan milte hai ki archimedies ko inaki jaankaree thi
 The composition of a fluidometer is based on the principle that the weight of a partially submerged and balanced body in a fluid is equal to the weight of the fluid that displaces the submerged portion of the body
 jab dravghnatvamaapi ko aise drav main chhodte hai jisamen yah swatantra rup se tair saktaa he, tab uske dand or drav ke samtal prishth ke pratichhedan se drav kaa ghanatv pard liya jaataa he
 a ruler is affixed within the penalty for reading
 yadi is maapni ke kisi vishisht anshankan chinh se neeche dravghnatvamaapi kaa aaytan he or drav kaa ghanatv he, to visthapit drav kaa dravyaman hua
 If the mass of the hydrometer is atev yadi dand par ankit nimnatam chinh ke neeche aaytan or ucchtam tathaa nimnatam chinhon ke bich aaytan he, to un ghantvon kaa paraas jo dravghnatvamaapi se naape ja sakate hai, m / se m / v tak he
 In obtaining these formulas, the minor effects of surface tension and temperature conversion have been neglected
 maapni par kiye gayi kramik anshankan-chinhon ke bich itnaa antar hota he ki ve suvidhapurvak padhe ja saken
 One experimental use is to estimate the purity of the fluid
 petroleum udyog main petroleum utpaadon ke ghanatv ko unke gun kaa maapdand mana jaataa he
 The relative density is often used in place of density, that is, the ratio of the density of both product and water at 15 ° c temperature
 jin dravon se kaam padataa he unke prasar-gunank bade hone ke kaaran unke ghantvon kii tulana ke liye ek vishisht taap kaa chunaa janaa vaanchhneeya he or yah taap saamanyatya 25 degree celsius liya jaataa he
 On the calibration signs of the ruler of a hydrometer, the densities are inscribed, which would be the temperature of the liquid in which the thermometer would sink to this degree
 kintu drav kaa sadaa is taap par laana asuvidhajanak hota he, isliye ek dwik sarini di rahati he, jisamen dravghnatvamaapi ke paathyank or dravataap ke sangat, 15 degree sein
 par ghanatv praapt karne ke liye sanshodhan padhaa ja saktaa he
 Sometimes the modified density is given only to avoid the mess of adding and subtracting, then these tables become larger; Because interpolation in the above table works, but in the table with true density, even a subtle increase of temperatures and readings has to be given
 dravghnatvamaapi kaa doosraa upyog sharkara ke vilyan main sharkara kii pratishtata gyaat karnaa he, jiske liye vilyan kaa taap or dravamaapi se uskaa ghanatv paathyank gyaat kar dwik sarini ke avlokan kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Thus it is necessary to have arrays with a thermometer
 aavashyaktaa padane par saraniyon ko sanshodhit kiya ja saktaa he or usee dravghnatvamaapi se kaam chal jaataa he
 If it is assumed in principle that the function of a thermometer is to read density and the function of arrays is to give significance to those readings, then simplification and removal of current misconceptions will be done in many cases
 kaach dravghnatvamaapi anilakrit hona chahie or aise kaach kaa bana hona chahie jisapar ooshmaa tathaa rasinic kriyaaon kaa prabhaav nunatam ho or jo dhari aadi dosha se mukt ho
 Its punishment is usually cylindrical, but other shapes are also prevalent

 If heavy material is mercury, it should be sealed in a separate bulb and if it is lead tablets and closed in the main bulb, they should be made stable by pasting them with wax
 maapni kaa kaagaj achche prakaar kaa ho or vah dand main majbootee se chipka rahe
 The signs marked with the ruler should be engraved on the stick, so that the ruler of the ruler is detected accidentally
 anshankan chinh ek urdhvadhar stambh main kshaitij disha main bane hon or yathasambhav paryaapt sankhya main hon tathaa lagbhag do do millimetre kii duuri par hon
 The basis of calibration on the scale, such as grams per milliliter at 15 ° C, should be inscribed
 yah saralata se siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki yadi dand ke ucchtam bindu ke sangat ghanatv ρ0 or nunatam ke sangat ρ1' he, to balve or dand ke aaytanon kaa anupaat If the internal diameter of the bar is the same, the length of the bar is l and the distance from the highest sign to the symbol with density r is l isse dekh sakate hai ki jaise-jaise ρ badhata he, l main vruddhi apekshtya kam hoti jaati he; falat: maapni main neeche kii ore anshankan chinh adhikadhik sameep hote jate hai
 Suppose is the read density of a fluid at temperature, then the approximate value of density at standard temperature is given by the following formula: jahaan dravamaapi ke kaach kaa prasar gunank he, jo saamanyatya 0
 xxrep 4 0 26 hota he
 Thus the effect of a temperature of 40 ° c will produce a 1% difference in density which is negligible
 jab dravghnatvamaapi kaa dand kisi drav main anshat: duubataa he, tab prishthtanav ke kaaran jal kaa tal dand ke sameep kuch unchaa uth jaataa he
 The greater the force from which the fluid rises, the greater the force, the lower the pressure, and thus the mass m increases; Here is the diameter of the lashing in centimeters, the surface of the liquid is the gravity, the gravity is
 isliye yadi maanak drav se, adhik prishthtanavvaale drav main, dravamaapi ghanatv padhata he, jo paathyank main sanshodhan For example, if =

 So the modification to the difference of 20 dine per second pore stresses exceeds 1

 saamaanya sankalan vidhi se 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + · · · kaa maan 1⁄2 praapt hota he jisamen nimna vidhiyaan shaamil hai: These are valid methods for compiling all convergent ranges but 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + · · · are not convergent ranges
 baharhaal, vibhinn sankalan vidhiyaan inke samaan hi grandi shrenee ko ek maan nirdisht karti hai
 Of these, the two simplest methods are sisera-sankalp and Abel Sankalp
 apsaari shreniyon kaa sankalan praapt karne kii pratham vidhi 1890 main arnesto sisera ne di thi
 Its basic idea is analogous to the Leibniz possible proximity, according to which Sisera is equal to the mean of all partial compilations in the compilation category
 pehle pratham n aanshik sankalnon kaa prayek n ke liye ausat maan σn he or iske baad isapar iskaa n ke anant kii ore agrasar hone par seemaant maan praapt kiya jaataa he
 For the Grandi series, the following is the sequence of parallel mean athwa, adhik sankethik rup main Where samaanaantar madhya kaa anukram 1⁄2 par abhisarit hota he atah Σak kaa sisera sankalan 1⁄2 he
 Similarly, the Sisera marginal value of the sequence 1, -1, 1, -1,


 is obtained 1⁄2
 shrenee 1 + 0 − 1 + 1 + 0 − 1 + · · · kaa sisera sankalan 2⁄3 he
 Therefore, the Sisera compilation of the series can be added to the infinite number of different parentheses, adding zeros to the infinite number
 shrenee kaa sankalan or adhik vyapak bhinn vidhi se bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Able compilation is analogous to Eiler's definition of the divergent series but it correctly excludes the objections of Calet and n ॰ Bernoli by properly constructing the function
 vastav main, islar dwaara ghaat shrenee kii seemaa sambandhi apni paribhaasha main vahi vidhi di he jo vartmaan main able vidhi ke rup main jaani jaati he
 The given range a0 + a1 + a2 + · · ·, can be modified to form the new range a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · ·
 yadi baad vaali shrenee 0 < x < 1 ke liye kisi falan par, x, 1 par agrasar he, abhisari he to ise mul shrenee kaa ebel sankalan kaha jaataa he
 After this according to the Abel theorem, this process is rational for simple sum
 grandi shrenee ke liye nimna prakaar likhaa ja saktaa he Able sum corresponding to the range 1 + 0 - 1 + 1 + 0 - 1 + · · · is 2⁄3 which is obtained from / 
 jab bhi koi shrenee sisera sankalneey hoti he tab vah able sankalneey bhi hoti he or uskaa yoga samaan praapt hota he
 In other ways, the Kaushi product of the Grandi category creates a range in itself but Sisera is not computable: kaa able sankalan 1⁄4 praapt hota he

 china ke sarkari sainya itihaas ke anusaar, is yuddh se china ne apane pashchimi sector kii seemaa kii raksha kii niti ke lakshyon ko hasil kiya, kyonki china ne aksai chin kaa vaastavik niyantran banaae rakhaa
 After the war, India abandoned the forward policy and the Line of Actual Control was converted into real borders
 james kelvin ke anusaar, bhale hi china ne ek sainya vijay paa lee parantu usne apni antarrashtriya chhavi ke maamle main kho di
 Western countries, especially the US, were already suspicious of Chinese attitudes, intentions and actions
 in deshon ne china ke lakshyon ko vishwa vijay ke rup main dekha or spasht rup se yah mana kii seemaa yuddh main china hamalavar ke rup main tha
 China's first nuclear weapons test in October 1964 and the support of Pakistan in the 1965 indo-pakistan War confirms the communist's goal and objectives and the American opinion of Chinese influence throughout Pakistan
 yuddh ke baad bhartiya sena main vyapak badlaav aaye or bhavishya main isi tarah ke sangharsh ke liye taiyaar rahane kii zarurat mahasoos kii gai
 The war put pressure on Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru who was seen as responsible for failing to anticipate a Chinese attack on India
 bharatiyon main deshbhakti kii baari lahar uthni shuru ho gayi or yuddh main shahid hue bhartiya sainikon ke liye kai smarak banaaye gaye
 Of course, the main lesson India learned from the war is the need to strengthen its own country and make a change from Nehru's "brotherhood" foreign policy with China
 bharat par chini akraman kii ashanka ko bhaanpane kii aakshamata ke kaaran, pradhanmantri nehru ko china ke saath shantivaadee sambandhon ko badhaava ke liye sarkari adhikariyon se kathor aalochana kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 Indian President Radhakrishnan said that Nehru's government was crude and careless about preparation
 nehru ne sweekaar kiya ki bhartiya apni samaj kii duniya main rah rahe the
 The Indian leaders spent a lot of effort on removing Krishna Menon from the Ministry of Defense rather than focusing solely on repelling the invaders
 bhartiya sena krishna menon ke "kripapaatr ko acchhee niyukti" kii nitiyon kii vajah se vibhajit ho gayi thi or kul milakar 1962 kaa yuddh bharatiyon dwaara ek sainya paraajay or ek raajnneetik aapadaa ke sangyojan ke rup main dekha gaya
 India did not use the Air Force to drive back Chinese troops under American advice, not by considering the available options
 siie ne baad main kaha ki us samay tibet main na to chini sainiko ke paas main paryaapt maatra main eendhan the or na hi kaaphi lambaa ranve tha jisase ve vaayu sena prabhavi rup se upyog karne main asamarth the
 Most Indians began to look at China and its soldiers with suspicion
 kai bhartiya yuddh ko china ke saath ek lambey samay se shanti sthapit karne main bharat ke prayaas main ek vishwasghaat ke rup main dekhne lage
 Questions also arose over Nehru's use of the term "hindi-chinese Bhai, Bhai"
 is yuddh ne nehru kii in aashaaon ko khatm kar diya ki bharat or china ek majboot asian dhruv bana sakate hai jo sheet yuddh gut kii mahashaktiyon ke badhate prabhaav kii pratikriya hogi
 The blame for the lack of a full-fledged army rests on Defense Minister Menon, who resigned from his government post so that the new minister could promote India's military modernization
 swadeshi sroton or aatmanirbharta ke madhyam se hathiyaaron kii aapurti kii bharat kii niti ko is yuddh ne pukhta kiya
 Pakistan began infiltrating into Jammu and Kashmir after realizing the Indian military weakness which eventually resulted in the second war with India in 1965
 haalanki, bharat ne yuddh main bharat kii apurna taiyaari ke kaarnon ke liye henderson-brookes-bhagat report kaa gathan kiya tha
 The result was inconclusive, as various sources were divided over the victory decision
 kuch sutron kaa tark he ki chunki bharat ne pakistan se adhik kshetra par kabja kar liya tha, bharat spasht rup se jeeta tha
 However, others argued that India suffered significant losses and, therefore, the outcome of the war was inconclusive
 do saal baad, 1967 main, chol ghatana ke rup main chini or bhartiya sainikon ke bich ek choti seemaa jhadap hui
 Eight Chinese soldiers and 4 Indian soldiers died in this incident

 Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja was the foremost among the freedom fighters of Kerala and a prince of the Kottayam royal dynasty
 unhen kerala sinham kaha jaataa he
 He was the king of Kottayam from 1774 to 1805
 east india company ke saath unka yuddh kotiot yuddh kaha jaataa he
 He had three senior kings above him in connection with his claim to the throne
 haalanki, jab mysore sena ne malabar par duusari baar kabza kiya tab kottayam shahi parivaar ke sabhi varisht sadsy travnakor bhaag gaye
 Pazhassi Raja led a well organized guerrilla fight against the much stronger Mysorean invaders than the Kottayam army
 is dauraan ve kottayam main sabase prabhaavshaalee vyakti ke rup main ubhare, kyonki janata apane priy rajkumaar ke saath majbootee se khadi hui, jisane unki vipatti main bhi unka saath nahin choda
 unke sainik nair yoddhaon tathaa kurichias or mullukurumbaas adivaasiyon ke bich se liye gaye the
 Kerala Varma Pazhassi Raja was born in Padinjare Kovilakam of Puranat Swaroopam, the Kottayam royal dynasty
 is padinjare kovilkam yaa is shahi rajvansh kii pashchimi shakha pazhassi main sthit thi
 Thus came the popular Pazhassi Raja name
 kannur jile kaa thalasseri taluka aaj jahaan he, vahaan kottayam kaa rajtv hua karata tha
 The capital of this kingdom was located at Pazhassi Kottayam, a small town not far from Telicherry
 haidar ali ne 1773 main malabar par is bahaane se duusari baar kabja kar liya ki 1768 main hui sahmati ke anusaar malabar ke raja ne uphaar bhent nahin kii
 Fearing Hyder's brutal army, most of the Malabar king's relatives fled to Travancore with their children and friends
 yadhyapi mysuri adhikariyon kii dharmandhta, lut-khasot or atyaacharon kaa malabar main sarvatra virodh hone laga, lekin netritvkaari logon ke palaayan se yah pratirodh araajaktaa main badalane laga
 However, Pazhassi Raja declared that it was cowardice to run away after seeing the danger in front
 ve kottayam main hi rahe or ek dal jutakar unhone chhapamar yuddh chalaanaa shuru kiya, kyonki unke paas paryaapt bandooken or sena nahin hone kii vajah se ve musuri sena ke saath aamane-saamne kii ladaai nahin lard sakate the
 The king built several bases in the almost impenetrable jungles and mountains of Puralimala and repeatedly damaged the Mysorean army in Kottayam and Wayanad
 1778 main, haidar ke jagirdaar, chirakkal ke raja ne khud haidar ke aadesh par talasseri ko gher liya or uski aarthik nakaabandi kar di
 Armed British factors at Talassery enabled the people of Pazhassi Raja to liberate Kottayam from the hands of the Mysorean army
 british sena ke is kadam se chirakkal sena par ab pazhassi sena dwaara peeche se hamalaa karnaa sunishchit ho gaya
 The Chirakkal army retreated
 lekin pazhassi ne unka peechha kiya or chirakkal sena ko tabah kar diya or uske baad ve kottayam kii ore kooch kar gayi, jahaan unhone mysuri kabje ko samaapt kiya or puure kottayam par apana kabja jamaa liya
 But at this critical moment when the Mysorean army in Malabar could be destroyed by the joint action of the British and the king, British factors at Talassery were instructed by the British governor not to end the nominal peace with Hyder
 is prakaar thalasseri main hui jeet ko nahin bhunaane ke british faisle kaa phayda mysore ne uthaaya
 balavant raav ke maatahat ek mysuri tukdi dwaara chirakkal sena ko majboot banaaya gaya, jisane kottayam kii ore kooch kiya
 Despite secretly supplying ammunition and weapons by the British, the people of Pazhassi failed to stop or defeat such a large army, and soon after a war the Kottayam army disintegrated
 uske baad mysore-chirkkal sena ne kadathanad par kabja kar liya or vahaan ek kathputli raja ko bitha diya gaya, jisane mysore ke saath haath mila rakhaa tha
 In 1779, a large mysore-chirakkal-kadathanad army surrounded Talassery
 pazhassi raja ne talasseri kii raksha ke liye 1300 nairon kii ek sena british kii madad ke liye bheji or isamen safalataa praapt hui
 By the end of 1779, the Mysorean commander Sardar Khan was sent to Talassery to bring the siege rapidly to a successful outcome
 sardaar khan jaanata tha ki pazhassi kii madad se hi uskaa pratirodh karne main british sakasham hue hai or isiilie usne pazhassi ke saath samjhauta vaarta shuru kii
 He proposed in front of Pazhassi that if he befriended Mysore and together provided a gift of five lakh rupees, the Mysore-occupied Kottayam territories would be given back
 It was beyond the control of Kottayam to arrange such a large amount in such a short time
 lekin pazhassi ne sardaar khan ko bhugtan karne ke liye apni ore se bade prayaas kiye or use 60,000 rupee kaa bhugtan kar bhi diya 
 lekin khan santusht nahin hua or usne malabar main unke adhikaar kii vaapasi ke pazhassi ke anurodh ko thukraa diya
 This greedy and defiant attitude of Sardar Khan ensured that it was almost impossible for Mysore to capture Talassery
 1780 main, pazhassi raja ne talasseri par se mysuri gheraabandi hataane ke liye angrejon ko ek yojana prastaavit kii: ve or unke log purab kii ore se peeche se dushman par dhaava bolenge or kile se baahar aakar angrej sena saamne se mysuri sena par hamalaa karegi
 This combined attack of both the armies will divide the enemy in two
 Then Mysore and Allied army can be easily overthrown
 But it was only in 1781 that the British understood the importance of this scheme and their Bombay officials agreed to it
 An operation was launched as per Pazhassi's plan and ended with the destruction of the Mysorean army
 sardaar khan bhi maaraa gaya
 After that the Nair warriors led by Pazhassi Raja revolted in Kottayam
 jald hi, mysoreiyon ko nikaal baahar kiya gaya
 By 1782, Kottayam was an independent country
 lekin angl-mysore yuddh ke baad mangalore kii sandhi se angrejon ne malabar par tipu sultan ke adhikaar ko manyata de di
 Thus he lost his only valuable ally, Kottayam was ready to become a vassal state of Mysore
 ek baar phir, jaisaa ki 1779 main sardaar khan ne kiya tha, mysore ne bhent kii bahut adhik dar tay kii
 Although Ravi Varma, elder brother of Pazhassi Raja agreed to pay Rs 65,000 per year, Mysore demanded Rs 81,000
 bhent kii badi hui dar se kisaanon kii mushkilen bad gayin jo pehle se hi varshon se videshi kabje se peedit the
 Then Pazhassi Raja took the issue into his own hands and started the mass resistance movement once again
 1788 ke ant tak, tipu kii jabaran dharmantaran kii niti kii vajah se tipu ke prati pazhassi kii ghrinaa bahut adhik bad gayi
 Pazhassi admitted that the British were certainly far less hostile and strengthened their relations with him
 aashcharya nahin ki nair yoddha jati ke safaaye ke liye lalli ke maatahat tipu ne ek sena kottayam se palakkad bheji
 lekin 1790 main, deccan ke yuddh par dhyaan dene kii vajah se tipu ne malabar yuddh ko tyaag diya
 Pazhassi Raja joined the British with 1500 Nairs to capture the Mysorean stronghold of Katirur
 katirur ke baad pazhassi or unki sena dakshin-purv kii ore badi or tipu ke aadamiyon se kuttiyadi kila chin liya
 Thus once again the entire Kottayam came under the control of Pazhassi Raja
 1790 main, angrejon ne travnakor main sharan liye mul raja ke bajaay pazhassi raja ko kottayam ke pramukh raja ke rup main manyata pradaan kii
 The king agreed to give 25,000 rupees as an offering to the British
 lekin, tisare angl-mysore yuddh main tipu kii haar ke baad angrejon or tipu ke bich hui seringapatom sandhi ke tahat malabar angrejon ko saunp diya gaya
 Then the British started establishing their supremacy in Malabar
 is maamle main angrejon or pazhassi kii raay ek-duusare ke vipareet thi - pazhassi ne angrejon kii madad isliye nahin kii thi ve british samprabhutaa sweekaar karne ko taiyaar the, balki isliye kii thi ki ve apane desh kottayam ko swatantra dekhnaa chaahate the
 Pazhassi got upset when he read the conditions laid down by the British in 1792 in front of the king of Malabar
 Though initially unsure, he later made up his mind and agreed to obey the British terms
 sharton kaa saransh is prakaar he: These conditions turned the king into a mere British agent
 apni ichha ke anusaar shashan karne ke raja ke adhikaar chhine ja chuke the or arthvyavastha par bhi unka niyantran nahin rahaa
 Pazhassi may have thought that the British would not interfere in the domestic administration of Kottayam, as the autonomy of the subordinate kings continued even during the Mysore period
 agar bhavishya ke bare main pazhassi ne aisa sochaa tha, to unhen nikat bhavishya main angrejon kii ore se mohabhang hona hi tha
 Pazhassi Raja opposed British imperialism from 1793 until his death in 1805
 apane rajya ke gharelu maamalon main british hastkshep ke virodh main unhone do yuddh lade
 1793-1797 tak kottayam prabandhan ke sawaal par or 1800-1805 tak vynad par malikana ke mudde par unhone yuddh kiya
 Pazhassi Raja did not have a good relationship with his uncle Veera Varma, the king of Kurumbranad
 1793 main, is dhoort chachaa raja ne british ayuktaon ko samajhaayaa ki use kottayam main kar jamaa karne diya jaay
 usne sochaa tha ki acchhee kar ugaahi se angrej khush ho jaaenge or use puure kottayam par kabja jamaane diya jayega
 kehane kii jarurat nahin ki pazhassi raja is british chaal se gusse main aa gaye
 He felt betrayed
 aakhirkaar uttari malabar main vahi ekmaatr raja the jinhone mysore ke saath yuddh main lagaataar angrejon kii madad kii thi
 Raja Veera Verma was a real fraudster - on one hand he took the direct responsibility of depositing tax in Kottayam and on the other hand he encouraged Pazhassi Raja to oppose the British
 Furthermore, the British assessment was rigorous and beyond the farmers' ability to pay
 unhone angrejon ke agenton dwaara jabaran kar ugaahi kaa virodh kiya or pazhassi raja ne is mudde ko apane haathon main le liya
 As seen earlier, the king strongly opposed this extortion
 1793 main, viroduswarup pazhassi raja ne kottayam main angrejon dwaara kar vasuuli nahin hone dene ko sunishchit kiya
 He also threatened that the British authorities would destroy the vines if they did not stop counting pepper vines
 baharhaal
 sthaneey british adhikariyon ne raja ke saath charchaa kii or jald hi donon ko veeraa verma ke gande khel kaa pataa chal gaya
 So, the British took the path of an acceptable solution to the king, with 20% of the total revenue going to the king and another 20% to the temple expenditure
 nikat bhavishya main mandir sampatti par koi kar nahin lagaaya janaa bhi tay hua
 In 1793, Tipu's lawyers complained to the British that the British subordinate Pazhassi Raja had captured most of Wayanad, which was still under Mysore
 jald hi raja vynad pathaar ke sarvocch ban gayi
 But the Governor General foolishly rescinded the 1794 agreement and Kottayam was granted a five-year lease to the Kurumbranad Raja
 raja ko isse vaazib taur par bada gussa aayaa or unhone prathagat kanoon ke anusaar apane desh kaa shashan chalaakar iskaa pratirodh karne kaa faisla kiya
 a year before the lease expired, the king gave asylum to Narangoli Nambiar of the great Nair Iruvazinad, whom the British termed the culprits, as he killed three people who had killed his kinsmen
 nambiar ke saath raja ke is dayabhav se angrej chidh gayi
 The British were also angry that the king crucified two dacoits according to customary law
 angrejon ne 'hatya' ke aarope main raja ko giraftaar karne kii yojana banaai, lekin yah sochakar is vichaar ko tyaag diya kyonki raja kii raksha main 500 sashastr vynad ke nair angrakshak lage hue the
 In 1795, Veera Varma could not collect taxes in Kottayam even after a year of Kottayam being leased, to which his nephew Raja is credited
 so, kar ugaahi main veeraa verma kii madad ke liye british sena bheji gayi, lekin paichi raja ke logon ne safaltaapurvak unka pratirodh kiya
 In 1796, orders were issued from Bombay to collect 2 years of unpaid tax in Kottayam
 The British no longer needed any excuse to arrest the king
 leftinent james gordon ke maatahat 300 sainik talasseri se bheje gayi or unhone pazhassi sthit raja ke kile rupi awaas par kabja kar liya
 But four days before that, the king had gone to Manattana
 gordon ne mahal ko lutaa jahaan raja kaa paaramparik khajaana rakhaa hua tha
 Raja was enraged by this loot and sent a letter to the supervisor at Talassery
 raja is baat se bhi naaraaz hue ki pajayamviden chandu naamak unka purv senapati kurumbranad raja kaa agent ban gaya tha or raja ko is baat se or bhi zyada gussa tab aayaa jab veeraa verma or angrejon ke aashirwad se us vishwasghaatee ne un par hukum chalaane kii dhristataa kii
 Chandu was later killed by a supporter of Katheri Ambu, when Pazayamvideen was about to kill the supporter
 raja apni rajdhani purali shrinkhalaa le gayi or uske baad vynad
 raja ne kuttiadi ghati ke jariye vynad or nichle malabar ke bich angrejon ke sabhi sanchaar avaruddh kar die
 The British retaliated, cutting off all communications between the king and lower Malabar
 lekin chunki unke paas paryaapt sena nahin thi, isliye peechha karne ke bajaay ve sahaayta kaa intjaar karne lage
 The British commandant was Colonel Doe, who was well known from the time of the siege of King Talassery
 to raja ne sochaa ki unka yah purana mitra angrej sarkaar ke saath madhyasthata main unki madad kar saktaa he
 The king offered to end the conflict, provided that he was pardoned and returned home along with his treasury
 The colonel and king, being old soldiers, hated unnecessary bloodshed and therefore sent the king's request to his commissioners, who, although strongly opposed to the king's independent style, still agreed with the colonel's advice
 While the king was in danger of joining Tipu
 uttari adheekshak ko raja kaa ghar waapas karne kaa aadesh diya gaya or bombai or sarvocch sarkaron dwaara raja kii kshamaa kii pushti kii gai
 But the orders of the government were communicated to the king through Veera Varma, which meant that uncle Raja did not convey to his nephew that the British had accepted his request
 chachaa raja kaa isamen nihit swaarth tha ki angrejon or bhattije pazhassi raja ke bich yuddh jari rahe
 Veera Varma also removed the king's special and commander Katheri Ambu from Kottayam's home administration
 ambu apane anuyaayiyon ke saath kannoth chale gayi, jahaan unhone janata kii madad se ek pratirodh kii yojana banaai or use lagu kiya, jisase veeraa verma dwaara kottayam main kar ugaahi ko roak paanaa sunishchit hua
 But Ambu was clearly working on the guidance of the king, who considered Ambu's expulsion as another conspiracy of his uncle, to weaken the king
 raja ko bhay tha ki angrej unhen giraftaar karne kii yojana bana rahe hai, isliye ve sudur vynad main chale gayi
 Their suspicion was further heightened by the British army mobilization in Wayanad
