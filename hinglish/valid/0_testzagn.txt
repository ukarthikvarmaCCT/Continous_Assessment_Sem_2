 In the era of both Byron Nelson and Woods, "making the cut" was defined as receiving a pay check
 haalanki, nelson ke dinon main, keval wo khilaadi jo ek pratiyogita main shuru ke 20 main aaye unhone pechack jeeta, jabaki woods ke dinon main keval wo khilaadi jo 36 holon ke andar sabase kam score par pahunchate hai wo hi pechack jitate hai
 Many golf analysts argue that Woods did not actually go beyond Nelson's consecutive cut marks, arguing that in the tournament's 31 contests in which Woods competed it was "no-cut" contests, meaning throughout the competition , Regardless of their score of up to 36 holes, all the players in the field were commanded to compete
 in vishleshkon kaa tark he ki yah woods dwaara banaaye gayi lagaatar cat kii antim sankhya 111 rah jaaegi tathaa nelson kii 113
 However, at least ten of the tournaments in which Nelson played were not modern-day cuts; That is, in these competitions all the players were guaranteed to compete against the previous 36 holes
 udhaaharan ke liye, da masters, ne ek 36-hole ke cat ko 1957 tak shuru nahin kiya, pijie championships ve match tha jo 1958 tak khelaa gaya, tathaa yah spasht nahi he ki teen duusari pratiyogitaayen jiname nelson ne muqabla kiya tha, main nelson ne 36-hole kiye the yaa nahin
 isliye, ye vishleshak "36-hole cat nahi" pratiyogitaaon ko dono cat rekha maapon se hataate hai, tathaa nelson dwaara 103 par or woods dwaara 111 par banaaye gayi
 In tournaments in which Nelson competed and did not have 36-hole cuts, only the top 20 players received a paycheck, while in these tournaments all players were guaranteed to compete against the previous 36 holes
 isliye, in no-cat pratiyogitaaon main, nelson ko abhi bhi sheersh 20 main rakhaa gaya he, isaliye nelson dwaara banaaya gayi 113 kats iske 113 sheersh samaapti ko pratibimbit karte hai
 Woods has made it to the top 20 21 times in a row and, out of 31 no-cut contests he has played, he has won 10 and finished as top 10 only 5 times

 People know the language of their society or country well because they are accustomed since childhood, but the language of other countries or societies does not speak well without it

 Just like our Hindi language is a language of the Indian Arya branch of the Aryan class of languages in terms of linguistics; And Brajbhasha, Awadhi, Bundelkhandi etc
 are its dialects or dialects

 The Sanskrit and Prakrit have evolved from the Vedic language of the Indian Aryans, the Apabhramamsa from the Prakritas, and the modern Indian languages from the Apabhransa

 Language is the most reliable means of expression
 yahi nahin vah hamaare abhyantar ke nirmaan, vikaas, hamaari asmita, saamaajik-saanskrithik pahchaan kaa bhi saadhan he
 Without language, man is completely incomplete and different from his history and tradition
 is samay saare sansar main praayah hajaaron prakaar kii bhashaayen boli jaati hai jo saadharantah apane bhashiyon ko chhod or logon kii samaj main nahin aatin

 praayah bhashaa ko likhit rup main vyakt karne ke liye lipiyon kii sahaayta leni padati he
 Language and script are two integral aspects of emotionalization
 ek bhashaa kai lipiyon main likhi ja sakati he or do yaa adhik bhashaaon kii ek hi lipi ho sakati he
 For example, Punjabi, Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi are written in both, while Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit, Nepali etc
 are all written in Devanagari
 bhashaa ko pracheen kaal se hi paribhaashit karne kii koshish kii jaati rahi he
 Some of its main definitions are as follows: ham vyavhaar main yah dekhte hai ki bhashaa kaa sambandh ek vyakti se lekar sampoorn vishwa-sristi tak he
 There are many forms of property earned from this tradition in practice between the individual and society
 samaaj saapekshata bhashaa ke liye anivaary he, thik vaise hi jaise vyakti saapekshata
 And language is indicative ie it is a 'symbol-position'
 isaki pratikatmak gatividhi ke chaar pramukh sanyojak haih do vyakti-ek vah jo sambodhit karata he, doosraa vah jise sambodhit kiya jaataa he, teesri sanketit vastu or chauthi-pratikatmak samvahak jo sanketit vastu kii ore pratinidhi bhangima ke saath sanket karata he
 In the process of development, the scope of language also increases
 yahi nahin ek samaaj main ek jaisi bhashaa bolne vaale vyaktiyon kaa bolne kaa dhang, unki ucchapan-prakriya, shabd-bhandar, vaakya-vinyas aadi alag-alag ho jane se unki bhashaa main paryaapt antar aa jaataa he
 This can be called style
 yon boli, vibhaasha or bhashaa kaa moulik antar bataa paanaa kathin he, kyonki isamen mukhyatya antar vyavhaar-kshetra ke vistaar par nirbhar he
 Due to individual diversity, many forms of the same language are seen in a society
 mukhya rup se bhashaa ke in roopon ko ham is prakaar dekhte hai- language, vibhaasha, or Language boli or bhashaa main antar hota he
 It is a small unit of language
 iskaa sambandh gram yaa mandal arthath simit kshetra se hota he
 In this, the predominance is through the medium of personal colloquial and there is an abundance of indigenous words and domestic vocabulary
 yah mukhya rup se bolchaal kii bhashaa he, iskaa rup kuch-kuch duuri par badalte paaya jaataa he tathaa lipibaddh na hone ke kaaran isamen saahitiyik rachanaaon kaa abhaav rahata he
 Anomalies are also found in it grammatically
 vibhaasha kaa kshetra boli kii apeksha vistrut hota he yah ek praant yaa uppraant main prachlit hoti he
 In a division, many dialects prevail on the basis of local differences
 vibhaasha main saahitiyik rachanaae mil sakati hai
 Language, or say the defined language or ideal language, is a developed state of division
 ise raashtra-bhashaa yaa taksaali-bhashaa bhi kaha jaataa he
 It is often seen that one of the different divisions is chosen for the Rajkarya on the basis of its merit, pride, literary growth, general publicity, etc
 and it is declared as the official language or national language

 In addition to Hindi, 21 other languages have been accepted as the official language for the states and union territories in the Indian constitution

 While his martyrdom day is celebrated every year on August 18 in Japan, his family members living in India still believe that Subhash did not die in 1945

 After this, Subhash wrote a letter to his elder brother Sharat Chandra Bose and wanted to know his opinion that the ideals of Swami Vivekananda and Maharishi Arvind Ghosh have been captured on their hearts and minds, how can they become slaves of the British by becoming ICS?

 motilal nehru is ayog ke adhyaksh or subhash uske ek sadsy the
 This commission presented the Nehru Report
 1928 main congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan motilal nehru kii adhyakshata main kolkata main hua
 In this session, Subhash wearing a khaki uniform saluted Motilal Nehru in a military manner
 gandhi ji un dinon purna swarajya kii maang se sahamat nahin the
 In this session, he was determined to demand Dominion status from the British government
 lekin subhashbabu or jawaharlal nehru ko purna swaraj kii maang se peeche hatana manjuur nahin tha
 In the end, it was decided that the British government should be given one year to give Dominion status
 agar ek saal main angrez sarkaar ne yah maang puri nahin kii to congress purna swaraj kii maang karegi
 But the British government did not meet this demand
 isaliye 1930 main jab congress kaa vaarshik adhiveshan jawaharlal nehru kii adhyakshata main lahore main hua tab aisa tay kiya gaya ki 26 janvari kaa din swatantrata diwas ke rup main manaaya jaayegaa
 On 26 January 1931, Subhash was leading a huge front by hoisting the national flag in Kolkata when the police fired sticks on him and wounded him and sent him to jail
 jab subhash jail main the tab gandhi ji ne angrej sarkaar se samjhauta kiya or sab kaidiyon ko reeha karvaa diya
 But the British government refused to release revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh
 bhagat singh kii phaansi maaf karaane ke liye gandhi ji ne sarkaar se baat to kii parantu narmi ke saath
 Subhash wanted Gandhiji to break the agreement made with the British government on this subject
 lekin gandhiji apni ore se diya gaya vachan todane ko raji nahin the
 The British government stood firm in its place and Bhagat Singh and his associates were hanged
 bhagat singh ko na bachaa paane par subhash gandhi or congress ke tarikon se bahut naaraaz ho gayi
 Subhash was imprisoned a total of 11 times in his public life
 sabase pehle unhen 16 july 1921 main chah maheene kaa karawas hua
 In 1925, a revolutionary named Gopinath Saha wanted to kill Kolkata Superintendent of Police Charles Tegart
 usne galati se arnest de naamak ek vyapaaree ko maar daalaa
 For this he was hanged
 gopinath ko phaansi hone ke baad subhash foot foot kar roye
 He sought the dead body of Gopinath and performed his last rites
 isse angrez sarkaar ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki subhash jvalant krantikariyon se na keval sambandh hi rakhte hai apitu ve unhen utprerit bhi karte hai
 On the same pretext, the British government arrested Subhash and sent him imprisoned in Mandal prison in Myanmar indefinitely without any trial
 5 navambar 1925 ko deshbandhu chittaranjan das kolkata main chal based
 Subhash heard the news of his death on the radio at Mandalay jail
 mandle karagrih main rahete samay subhash kii tabiyat bahut kharaab ho gayi
 He developed tuberculosis
 parantu angrez sarkaar ne phir bhi unhen reeha karne se inkaar kar diya
 To release them, the government placed a condition that they go to Europe for treatment
 lekin sarkaar ne yah spasht nahin kiya ki ilaaj ke baad ve bharat kab laut sakate hai
 Hence Subhash did not accept this condition
 aakhir main paristhiti itani kathin ho gayi ki jail adhikariyon ko yah lagane laga ki shaayad ve karawas main hi na mar jaayen
 The British government did not even want to take the risk that Subhash died in prison
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 Subhash then went to Dalhousie for treatment
 1930 main subhash karawas main hi the ki chunaav main unhen kolkata kaa mahayor chunaa gaya
 Therefore, the government was forced to release him
 1932 main subhash ko phir se karawas hua
 This time he was kept in Almora jail
 almoda jail main unki tabiyat phir se kharaab ho gayi
 On the advice of doctors, Subhash agreed to go to Europe this time for treatment
 san 1933 se lekar 1936 tak subhash europe main rahe
 Subhash continued his work in Europe, taking care of his health
 vahaan ve italy ke netaa musolini se mili, jinhone unhen bharat ke swatantrata sangram main sahaayta karne kaa vachan diya
 De Valera, the leader of Ireland, became a good friend of Subhash
 jin dinon subhash europe main the unheen dinon jawaharlal nehru kii patni kamala nehru kaa austria main nidhan ho gaya
 Subhash went there and consoled Jawaharlal Nehru
 baad main subhash europe main vitthal bhai patel se mili
 Subhash along with Vitthalbhai Patel held the mantra which came to be known as patel-bose analysis
 is vishleshan main un donon ne gandhi ke netritv kii jamkar ninda kii
 Subsequently, when Vitthal Bhai Patel became ill, Subhash served him a lot
 magar vitthal bhai patel nahin bache, unka nidhan ho gaya
 In his will, Vitthal Bhai Patel gave all his property to Subhash
 magar unke nidhan ke pashchaat unke bhai sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne is vasiyat ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Sardar Patel prosecuted this will in court
 yah mukadmaa jeetne par sardaar vallabh bhai patel ne apane bhai kii sari sampatti gandhi ke harijan seva kaary ko bhent kar di
 In 1934, Subhash received the news of his father's death
 khabar sunate hi ve hawaii jahaaj se karachi hote hue kolkata laute
 Even though he had come to know in Karachi that his father had died, he still went to Kolkata
 kolkata pahonchte hi angrej sarkaar ne unhen giraftaar kar liya or kai din jail main rakhkar waapas europe bhej diya
 In 1934, when Subhash was staying in Austria for his treatment, he needed an English-knowing typist to write his book
 unke ek mitra ne emily shenkal naam kii ek austrian mahila se unki mulaakaat kara di
 Emily's father was a famous vet
 subhash emily kii ore aakarshith hue or un donon main swaabhaavik prem ho gaya
 In view of the strict laws of Nazi Germany, both of them got married in 1942 by Hindu method at a place called Bad Gastein
 viena main emily ne ek putree ko janm diya
 Subhash first saw her when she was barely four weeks old
 unhone uskaa naam anita bose rakhaa tha
 When Subhash died in an alleged plane crash in Taiwan in August 1945, Anita Paune was three years old
 anita abhi jivit he
 Her name is Anita Bose Faf
 apane pita ke parivaar janon se milane anita phalf kabhi-kabhi bharat bhi aati he
 In 1938, the annual session of the Congress was scheduled to be held in Haripura
 is adhiveshan se pehle gandhi ji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa
 This was the 51st session of the Congress
 isliye congress adhyaksh subhash chandra bose kaa swaagat 51 belon dwaara khinche hue rath main kiya gaya
 Subhash's presidential speech was very effective in this session
 kisi bhi bhartiya raajnneetik vyakti ne shaayad hi itnaa prabhavi bhaashan kabhi diya ho
 During his presidential tenure, Subhash established the Planning Commission
 jawaharlal nehru iske pehle adhyaksh banaaye gayi
 Subhash also established a Science Council in Bangalore under the chairmanship of the famous scientist Sir Visvesvaraya
 1937 main japan ne china par akraman kar diya
 Under the chairmanship of Subhash, the Congress decided to send a medical team under the leadership of Dr
 Dwarkanath Kotnis to assist the Chinese people
 aage chalakar jab subhash ne bharat ke swatantrata sangram main japan se sahyog kiya tab kai log unhe japan kii kathputli or phacist kehane lage
 But this incident proves that Subhash was neither a puppet of Japan nor did he agree with the fascist ideology
 1938 main gandhiji ne congress adhyaksh pad ke liye subhash ko chunaa to tha magar unhen subhash kii kaarypaddati pasand nahin aayi
 Meanwhile, the Second World War was clouded in Europe
 subhash chaahate the ki england kii is kathinaayee kaa laabh uthaakar bharat kaa swatantrata sangram adhik teevr kiya jaye
 He had also started taking steps in this direction during his presidential tenure but Gandhiji did not agree with this
 1939 main jab nayaa congress adhyaksh chunane kaa vakt aayaa tab subhash chaahate the ki koi aisa vyakti adhyaksh banaaya jaye jo is maamle main kisi dabaav ke aage bilkul na jhuke
 since no one is volunteering so, subhash decided to be Congrees President
 lekin gandhi unhen adhyaksh pad se hataanaa chaahate the
 Gandhi chose Pattabhi Sitaramaiya for the post of president
 kaviver rabindranath thakur ne gandhi ko khat likhakar subhash ko hi adhyaksh banane kii vinati kii
 Scientists like Prafulla Chandra Rai and Meghnad Saha also wanted to see Subhash as the president again
 lekin gandhiji ne is maamle main kisi kii baat nahin maani
 Years later, on finding a deal in Congress was elected to the presidency
 sab samajhate the ki jab mahatma gandhi ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kaa saath diya hai tab ve chunaav aasaani se jeet jaayenge
 But in reality, Subhash got 1580 votes and Sitaramayya got 1377 votes in the election
 gandhiji ke virodh ke baavjood subhashbabu 203 maton se chunaav jeet gayi
 But with the result of the election, the matter did not end
 gandhiji ne pattabhi sitaramaiyya kii haar ko apni haar bataakar apane saathiyon se kah diya ki agar wein subhash ke tareekon se sahamat nahin hai to wein congress se hat sakaten hai
 After this, 12 of the 14 members of the Congress executive resigned
 jawaharlal nehru tatasth bane rahe or akele sharadbabu subhash ke saath rahe
 The annual Congress session of 1939 took place in Tripuri
 is adhiveshan ke samay subhashbabu tej bukhaar se itane biimaar ho gayi the ki unhen strechar par litaakar adhiveshan main laana padaa
 Gandhiji himself was not present in this session and his colleagues also did not give any support to Subhash
 adhiveshan ke baad subhash ne samjhaute ke liye bahut koshish kii lekin gandhiji or unke saathiyon ne unki ek na maani
 The situation became such that Subhash could not do anything
 aakhir main tang aakar 29 april 1939 ko subhash ne congress adhyaksh pad se istipha de diya
 On 3 May 1939, Subhash established his own party within the Congress in the name of Forward Bloc
 kuch din baad subhash ko congress se hi nikaal diya gaya
 Later, the Forward Bloc became an independent party on its own
 dwitiya vishwayuddh shuru hone se pehle se hi forward block ne swatantrata sangram ko or adhik teevr karne ke liye jan jagriti shuru kii
 On 3 September 1939, Subhash was reported to be fighting a war in Britain and Germany in Madras
 unhone ghoshnaa kii ki ab bharat ke paas sunaharaa mauka he use apni mukti ke liye abhiyaan tej kar dena chahiye
 On 8 September 1939, Subhash was called to the Congress Working Committee as a special invitee to decide the party's stance towards the war
 unhone apni raay ke saath yah sankalp bhi doharaaya ki agar congress yah kaam nahin kar sakati he to forward block apane dam par british raaj ke khilaaf yuddh shuru kar degaa
 The following year in July, the Halwet Pillar at Calcutta, which was a symbol of India's slavery, was submerged overnight by Subhash's youth brigade
 subhash ke swayamsevak uski neenv kii ek-ek eent ukhaad le gayi
 This was a symbolic beginning
 iske madhyam se subhash ne yah sandesh diya tha ki jaise unhone yah stambh dhul main mila diya he usee tarah ve british samrajya kii bhi eent se eent baja denge
 As a result, the British government imprisoned all the main leaders of the forward block, including Subhash
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan subhash jail main niskriy rahanaa nahin chaahate the
 Subhash started a fast in jail to force the government to release him
 haalat kharaab hote hi sarkaar ne unhen reeha kar diya
 But the British government also did not want Subhash to be free during the war
 isaliye sarkaar ne unhen unke hi ghar par najarband karke baahar police kaa kadaa paharaa bitha diya
 Subhash made a plan to get out of detention
 16 janvari 1941 ko ve police ko chakma dete hue ek pathan mohammad jiauddin ke vesh main apane ghar se nikle
 Sharadbabu's elder son Shishir took him away from Kolkata to Gomoh in his car
 gomoh railway stesan se frontier mail pakadakar ve peshawar pahunche
 In Peshawar he found Mian Akbar Shah, a co-operative of the Forward Bloc
 miyaan akbar shah ne unki mulaakaat, keerti kisaan party ke bhagatraam talwaar se kara di
 With Bhagatram Talwar, Subhash set out from Peshawar towards Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan
 is safar main bhagatraam talwaar rahamat khan naam ke pathan or subhash unke guunge-bahere chachaa bane the
 He completed this journey by walking in the hills
 kabul main subhash do maheenon tak uttamchand malhotra naamak ek bhartiya vyapaaree ke ghar main rahe
 There he first wanted to enter the Russian Embassy
 isamen naakaamayaab rahane par unhone german or italian duutavaason main pravesh paane kii koshish kii
 His attempt at the Italian Embassy was a success
 german or italian duutavaason ne unki sahaayta kii
 Finally, after becoming an Italian man named Arlando Mazzonta, Subhash left Kabul and reached Berlin, the capital of Germany via Moscow, the capital of Russia
 berlin main subhash sarvapratham riben trope jaise germany ke anya netaaon se mili
 He founded the Indian Freedom Organization and Azad Hind Radio in Germany
 isi dauraan subhash netaji ke naam se jane jane lage
 Adam Fon Trott, a minister in the German government, became a good friend of Subhash
 aakhir 29 may 1942 ke din, subhash germany ke sarvocch netaa adolf hitler se mili
 But Hitler was not particularly interested in India
 unhone subhash ko sahaayta kaa koi spasht vachan nahin diya
 Many years ago Hitler wrote the autobiography named Mayan Kampf
 is kitaab main unhone bharat or bhartiya logon kii buraai kii thi
 Subhash expressed his displeasure with Hitler on this subject
 hitler ne apane kiye par maafee maangi or min kamff ke agle sanskaran main vah pariched nikaalane kaa vachan diya
 At last, Subhash came to know that he will not get anything from Hitler and Germany
 isaliye 8 march 1943 ko germany ke keel bandargah main ve apane saathi aabid hasan safrani ke saath ek german pandubbi main baithkar purvi asia kii ore nikal gayi
 The German submarine took her to the shores of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean
 vahaan ve donon samudr main tairkar japani pandubbi tak pahunche
 At the time of World War II, it was the only interchange of civilians by the submarines of the navies of any two countries
 yah japani pandubbi unhen indonesia ke padang bandargah tak pahunchaakar aayi
 Arriving in East Asia, Subhash first took the leadership of the Indian Council of Independence from veteran revolutionary Rasbihari Bose
 singapore ke edward park main rasbihari ne swechha se swatantrata parishad kaa netritv subhash ko saunpa tha
 Japan's Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo, impressed by Netaji's personality, assured him to cooperate
 kai din pashchaat netaji ne japan kii sansad ke saamne bhaashan diya
 On 21 October 1943, Netaji established the arzi-hukumate-azad-hind in Singapore
 ve khud is sarkaar ke raashtrapati, pradhanmantri or yumantri bane
 a total of nine countries recognized this government
 netaji azaad hind fouj ke pradhan senapati bhi ban gayi
 In the Azad Hind Fauj, the Japanese army recruited Indian prisoners of war holding the British
 azaad hind fuj main auraton ke liye jhansi kii rani regiment bhi banaayi gayi
 In East Asia, Netaji gave several speeches and appealed to the permanent Indian people to join the free Indian army and provide financial help
 unhone apane aavahan main yah sandesh bhi diya - "tum mujhe khun do, main tumhen azaadi doongaa
 " dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan azaad hind fouj ne japani sena ke sahyog se bharat par akraman kiya
 To inspire his army, Netaji gave the slogan "delhi Chalo"
 donon phujon ne angrejon se andaman or nicobar dweep jeet liye
 This island remained under the discipline of arji-hukumte-azad-hind
 netaji ne in dwipon ko "shahid dweep" or "swaraj dweep" kaa nayaa naam diya
 The two forces jointly attacked Imphal and Kohima
 lekin baad main angrejon kaa palada baari padaa or donon phujon ko peeche hatana padaa
 When the Azad Hind Fauj was retreating, the Japanese army arranged for Netaji to flee
 parantu netaji ne jhansi kii rani regiment kii ladakiyon ke saath saikadon mile chalate rahanaa pasand kiya
 Thus Netaji presented a model of true leadership
 6 july 1944 ko azaad hind radio par apane bhaashan ke madhyam se gandhiji ko sambodhit karte hue netaji ne japan se sahaayta lene kaa apana kaaran or arji-hukuumate-azaad-hind tathaa azaad hind fouj kii sthapana ke uddeshy ke bare main bataaya
 During this speech, Netaji called Gandhiji the Father of the Nation, only then Gandhiji also called him Netaji
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main japan kii haar ke baad, netaji ko nayaa rasta dhoondhna jaruri tha
 He decided to ask Russia for help
 18 agast 1945 ko netaji hawaii jahaaj se manchuriya kii taraf ja rahe the
 He went missing during this journey
 is din ke baad ve kabhi kisi ko dikhaayi nahin diye
 On August 23, 1945, Tokyo Radio reported that Netaji was coming from a large bomber aircraft in Saigon that his plane crashed near Taihoku Airport on August 18
 vimaan main unke saath savaar japani general shodei, pilet tathaa kuch anya log maare gayi
 Netaji was severely burnt
 unhen taihoku sainik aspataal le jaaya gaya jahaan unhone dam tod diya
 According to Colonel Habiburrahman, his last rites were performed in Taihoku
 sitambar ke madhya main unki asthiyaan sanchit karke japan kii rajdhani tokio ke rankoji mandir main rakh di gayin
 According to a document received from the National Archives of India, Netaji died on August 18, 1945 at 21
00 at the military hospital in Taihoku
 swatantrata ke pashchaat bharat sarkaar ne is ghatana kii jaanch karne ke liye 1956 or 1977 main do baar ayog niyukt kiya
 Both times it was found that Netaji was killed in that plane crash
 lekin jis taiwan kii bhoomi par yah durghatana hone kii khabar thi us taiwan desh kii sarkaar se in donon aayogon ne koi baat hi nahin kii
 In 1999, a third commission was formed under the leadership of Manoj Kumar Mukherjee
 2005 main taiwan sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog ko bataa diya ki 1945 main taiwan kii bhoomi par koi hawaii jahaaj durghatnagrast hua hi nahin tha
 In 2005, the Mukherjee Commission submitted its report to the Government of India, stating that there was no evidence of Netaji's death in that plane crash
 lekin bharat sarkaar ne mukherjee ayog kii report ko asweekaar kar diya
 Where Netaji went missing on 18 August 1945 and what happened next has become the biggest unanswered mystery in Indian history
 desh ke alag-alag hisson main aaj bhi netaji ko dekhne or milane kaa daawa karne vaale logon kii kami nahin he
 Many claims have been made about the existence of Netaji from Gumnami Baba of Faizabad to District Raigad in Chhattisgarh state, but the authenticity of all these is doubtful
 chhattisgarh main to subhash chandra bose ke hone kaa maamla rajya sarkaar tak gaya
 But the state government closed the file of the case, considering it not worthy of intervention
 kalakatta hai court ne netaji ke laapata hone ke rahasy se jude khufia dastavejon ko saarvajanik karne kii maang par sunwaayee ke liye special bench ke gathan kaa aadesh de diya he
 This petition has been filed by the government organization India Smile
 is yachika main bharat sangh, rashtriya salaahkaar parishad, ro, khufia vibhaag, pradhanmantri ke nijee sachiv, raksha sachiv, grih vibhaag or pashchim bengal sarkaar sahit kai anya logon ko prativaadee banaaya gaya he
 All references to Hiroshima and Nagasaki changed after the demolition
 aatmasamarpan ke uparant japan chaar-paanch varshon tak america ke paanvon tale karahata rahaa
 This was the reason that the thrilling history of Netaji and Azad Hind Sena kept gathering dust in the archives of Tokyo for years
 navambar 1945 main dilli ke laal kile main aaazaad hind fouj par chalaaye gayi mukademe ne netaji ke yash main varnanaatit vruddhi kii or ve lokapriyata ke shikhar par ja pahunche
 Despite the lawful propaganda by the British and Subhash's opposition by the then major political parties, after that lawsuit that shook the whole country, the mothers began to take pride in naming their sons 'subhash'
 ghar–ghar main rana pratap or chhatrapati shivaji maharaj ke jod par netaji kaa chitra bhi dikhaai dene laga
 Netaji's attempt to liberate India from the clutches of the British through the Azad Hind Fauj was not directly successful but had far-reaching consequences
 san 1946 ke nausena vidroh iskaa udhaaharan he
 It was only after the naval revolt that Britain was convinced that the Indian Army could no longer rule in India and they had no other option but to free India
 aaazaad hind fouj ko chhodkar vishwa-itihaas main aisa koi bhi drushtaant nahin miltaa jahaan tees-pantis hajaar yudhbandiyon ne sangathit hokar apane desh kii aazaadee ke liye aisa prabal sangharsh chhedaa ho
 While the foreign rulers were afraid of Netaji's power before independence, after independence, the native rulers were terrified by the indelible influence of his personality and compassion on the masses
 swatantryavir saavarkar ne swatantrata ke uparant desh ke krantikariyon ke ek sammelan kaa aayojan kiya tha or usamen adhyaksh ke asana par netaji ke tailchitr ko asin kiya tha
 It was an unprecedented salute given by one Krantivir to another Kranti Veer

 In addition to his incomplete autobiography, An Indian Traveler, he also wrote an entire book in two volumes, India's Struggle, which was first published from London
 yah pustak kaaphi prasiddh hui thi
 Although his autobiography remained incomplete, he had a desire to complete it, which is evident from the plan made on the first page of the original manuscript
 iske atirikt netaji ne apane bahuaiami swatantraaa sangharsh ke sandarbh main aganit patr likhe, bhaashan diye evam radio ke madhyam se bhi unke vyaakhyaan prasaarit hue
 a large volume of letters is also related to his personal life

 The initial plan was to publish 'samagra Sahitya' in 10 volumes, but later the scheme was reduced to 12 sections
 april 1980 main sarvapratham bangla main iske pratham khand kaa prakaashan hua tha or november 1980 main angreji main
 Its first volume in Hindi was published in 1982 and then overall literature in these three languages continued to be published
 iskaa antim khand 2011 i0 main chap kar aa paaya; haalanki isaki saamagree pehle se hi taiyaar thi
 Sugat Bose was also associated with the compilation and publication work of this 'samagra Vaamay' and the last two volumes were published mainly due to the sad demise of Dr
 Shishir Kumar Bose in the editing of Sugat Bose itself
 is 'samgr vaanmay' ke pratham khand main unki 'aatmakatha' ke saath kuch patron kaa prakaashan hua he or dwitiya khand main unki suprasiddh pustak 'bharat kaa sangharsh' kaa prakaashan hua he
 Then in other sections, there is a systematic publication of the entire available literature, such as letters written by him, comments and speeches
 is prakaar yathasambhav uplabdh netaji kaa likhit evam vaachik 'samgr vaanmay' adhyayan hetu sulabh ho gaya he or yah yugin aavashyaktaa bhi he ki mahatma gandhi kii tarah netaji ke sandarbh main bhi anekanek sandarbh-rahit kathanon evam apurna jaankariyon ke aadhaar par raay kaayam karne kii bajaay upyukt mudde ko uske upyukt evam samyak sandarbhon main dekhte hue sateek evam pramanik raay kaayam kii jaay
 China and India are the two big developing countries of the world

 The first April of this year marks the 55th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and India
 varsh 1949 main naye china kii sthapana ke baad ke agle varsh, bharat ne china ke saath rajanyik sambandh sthapit kiye
 In this way, India became the first non-socialist country to recognize the People's Republic of China
 china va bharat ke bich rajanyik sambandhon kii aupchaarik sthapana ke baad ke pichley 55 varshon main china-bharat sambandh kai sopanon se gujarey
 Their development was generally active and steady, but there were sweet and bitter memories in between

 He has been engaged in the research of political relations between China and India for thirty years
 shri maa ja lee ne pichley bharat-china sambandhon ke 55 varshon ko paanch bhaagon main vibhajit kiya he
 According to him, the relations between China and India were in the best period of history in the 1950s
 donon deshon ke sheersh netaaon ne tab ek-duusare ke yahaan kii anek yatraaen kin or unki janata ke bich bhi khaasi awajahi rahi
 The two countries then had close political ties
 lekin, 1960 ke dashak main china va bharat ke sambandh apane sab se sheet kaal main pravesh kar gayi
 Despite this, the friendly relations of the two are several thousand years old
 isliye, yah sheetkaal ek aitihaasik lambi nadi main ek choti lahar kii tarah hi tha
 By the mid-70s, they had once again come out of winter
 china-bharat sambandhon main shithily aayaa, to donon deshon kii sarkaron ke ubhay prayaason se donon ke bich phir ek baar rajdoot str ke rajanyik sambandhon kii bahaali hui
 From the 1980s to the mid-1990s, relations between China and India had warmed up
 haalanki varsh 1998 main donon deshon ke sambandhon main bharat dwaara paanch misile chhodane se phir ek baar thandapan aayaa
 But it ended immediately after the Indian Foreign Minister's visit to China in 1999 with the efforts of both governments
 ab china-bharat sambandh kadam ba kadam ghanishtha ho rahe hai
 The sino-indian relations are steadily improving over the years
 china va bharat ke varisht adhikariyon ke bich awajahi badi he
 Former Chinese Ambassador to India Chiyo Kang said, now china-india relations have entered a new era
 idhar ke varshon main, china va bharat ke netaaon ke bich awajahi badi
 In 2001, former Chinese leader Li Fung visited India

 After this, Indian Prime Minister Vajpayee visited China in the year 2003
 unhone chini pradhanmantri van chaa paao ke saath china-bharat sambandhon ke siddhant or chaturmukhi sahyog ke ghoshnaptr par hastakshar kiye
 This manifesto revealed that the bilateral relations between China and India have entered a relatively mature period
 is ghoshnaptr ne anek mahatvapurn dwipaksheeya samasyaon va kshetreey samasyaon par donon ke samaan rukh bhi spasht kiye
 It was also considered as a milestone document directing the development of future bilateral relations
 china va bharat ke sambandh puraani neenv par or unnat ho rahe hai
 On foreign policy, China and India favor the establishment of a multi-polar world, oppose the dominion and politics of force and oppose any powerful country to become the world's police
 antarrashtriya sambandhon main maujuud vartmaan vivaadon kaa kis tarah nipataara ho or deshon ke bich kis tarah kaa vyavhaar kiya jaye ye do samasyaayein vibhinn deshon ke saamne khadi hai
 China and India believe that the five principles of peaceful coexistence enforced by them reflect the goals and principles of the United Nations Charter, which should be followed by various countries of the world

 khelon ke prakaaron main anveshnatmak, sanrachanaatmak, kaalpanik or niyambaddh khel shaamil hai
 Cultural variations are also seen in sports
 khel se bacchon kaa shaareerik, sangyanatmak, samvegatmak, saamaajik evam naitik vikaas ko badhaava miltaa hai kintu abhibhavakon kii khel ke prati nakaaratmak abhivritti evam kriyalap ne buree tarah prabhavit kiya hai
 Therefore, it is imperative that teachers and parents understand the importance of sports
 khel ke bare main aam dharna yah he ki yah kaam kaa vilom he
 Sports is a situation in which people are not doing any useful or specific work
 khel ke bare main ek soch yah bhi he ki yah anandadaayak, mukt or anayas hota he
 This approach negates the importance of sports in the development of young children
 kai saalon se kai manovaigyanik siddhantkaar bachche ke vikaas main khel ke mahatv par jor dene lage hai
 He has emphasized many aspects of the game and explained how the game affects psychological processes
 manovaigyanikon kii drushti main khel ateet se mukt or purnjivan kaa rasta he
 It is discovery, initiative and freedom
 khel se manushya kii manovaigyanik jaruratein puri hoti hai
 And it also gives man the opportunity to develop social skills
 piyaaje ke anusaar khel bacchon kii maansik kshamtaaon ke vikaas main bhi ek badi bhoomika nibhaate hai
 In the first stage, the child tries to get sensation with objects and conduct tasks
 duusare charan main baccha kalpanaaon ko rup dene ke liye vastuon ko kisi ke pratik ke rup main upyog karne lagata he
 In the last stage, the child engages in a game of rules as compared to games of fictional roles
 khelon se taarkik kshamta va skool sambandhi kaushalon ko viksit hone main madad milti he
 Vygotsky researchers, inspired by his ideas, do not believe that sports undergo a natural change with age
 ve vayaskon va saamaajik sandarbhon se milane vaale maargdarshan ko iske liye mahatvapurn maanate hai
 According to him, adults can increase the level of children's play
 vaigotski ke anusaar - jatil bhoomikaaon vaale khelon main bacchon kaa apane vyavhaar ko sangathit karne kaa behatar va surakshit avasar miltaa he jo vaastavik sthitiyon main nahin miltaa
 In this way, the game creates an area of close development for the child
 schuli sthiti kii tulana main khel ke dauraan bacchon kii ekaagratha, smriti aadi ucchtar str par kaam karti hai
 New developmental skills of the child first emerge in the game
 khel naatakon main baccha apane aantarik vichaar ke anusaar kaam karata he or moort rup main dikhne vaali chizon se bandhaa nahin rahata
 From here, there starts preparation for abstract thinking and thinking
 yah lekhan kii bhi taiyaari hoti he kyonki likhit rup main shabd vastu jaisaa nahin hota, uske vichaar kaa pratik hota he
 The age in which complex and elaborate roles and language are used in the game remains a major activity for the development of the child
 yah sthiti 10-11 saal tak ke bacchon main kam rah sakati he
 Gradually, its importance starts decreasing
 shikshak bacchon ko khilne kaa paryaapt samay va saadhan dekar vishyon kaa suzav dekar, jhagadon kaa samaadhaan karke khel ko or samrudh bana sakate hai
 According to Erickson and Anna Freud, the game is a replacement for unfulfilled desires and a way of liberation and revival from the deadly events of the past
 manovishleshnatmak paddati khel ke saamaajik samvegatmak pakshon par bal detii he
 Through the game, the child resolves his mental conflicts with the parents and, irrational, fears
 ek bacchee rakshas-rakshas khel kar andhere ke bhay par kaabo paati he, ek baccha apni gudiya ko kisi niyam ke kalpit ulanghan ke liye usee tarah sajaa detaa he jaise ek mata-pita usko sajaa dete hai
 In Erickson's view, sports are a way of discovery, initiative and freedom for a child during the preschool phase
 manovaigyanik drushti se khel virechak anubhav main madhyam se aakraamakata ko disha dene kaa ek tarika he
 It is also a response to the past and a mechanism for returning to the events of the past
 partail or anya siddhantkaar khel ko saamaajik aadan-pradaan ke ek rup kii tarah dekhte hai jo sahpaathiyon ke saath sahyogi kaaryon main sanlagn hone kii bachche kii viksit hoti hui kshamta ko uttam bhi banaata he or pratibimbit bhi karata he
 In the early stages of the game, exchanges with classmates occur almost or little and there is also an inability to use social skills at that time
 aage chalakar duusare ke paksh se dekhne kii kshamta, vibhinn bhoomikaaon main samanvay, khel kii vishaywastu ke bare main baatcheet or jhagadon ko sulajhane kii samarthy kaa vikaas hota hua dikhaai detaa he
 Fictitious and dramatic situations in play are generally considered to be more mature methods of social exchange
 kuch shodhakartaaon ne dhakka-mukki vaale khelon ko bhi saamaajik drushtikon se dekha he
 All types of wrestling and 'catch to go' category of sports can be included under the push
 saamaajik khelon kii tarah dhakka-mukki ke khelon main bhi bhoomikaayen hoti hai
 Children are inquisitive in nature
 khelte hue bacchon ko vastuen chune, unhen dhyaan se dekhne or aasapaas ke vaataavaran kii chaanbin karne kaa mauka miltaa he or isse unhen apane man main uthte hue anek prashnon ke uttar milte hai
 Through sports activities, they also begin to understand the occurrence of common events
 bacchon ko icchaanusaar khilne ke avasar dene se ham unki seekhney main madad karte hai
 The game gives children the opportunity to explore and learn by themselves
 khoj kaa arth he ghatnaon or vastuon ke bare main swayan pataa lagaana
 In the game, the girl has the freedom to choose the activities according to her interest, hence she chooses games which are neither very simple nor very difficult but challenging for her
 is prakaar vah un chizon ko sikhti he jinhen seekhney ke liye vah taiyaar hoti hai
 Thus learning process becomes enjoyable rather than a burden
 saath hi saath bachche khel main kriyalap dwaara sikhte hai
 Concepts can be better understood by doing so
 yadi bacchon ko kisi sankalpana ke bare main keval maukhik rup main bataaya jaae or swayan karne ko mauka nahin diya jaae to vah use itani acchhee tarah nahin samaj paaenge
 The fact that 'children learn by doing something' does not mean that the follower has no role in it
 sabase pehle paalankarta kii aavashyaktaa isliye he ki vah bacchon ko unki khoj samajhane main madad kar sake
 Second, the follower may broaden the child's search
 bachche nayaa sikhte hai jab unhen khel saamagree se khilne diya jaataa he or swayan kuch karne ke liye protsaahit kiya jaae
 Finally, the follower should not always wait for the children to do anything themselves
 use bacchon ke liye aisi paristhitiyon kaa aayojan karnaa chahie jinke dwaara bachche nayaa sikh saken
 When the follower is doing this, he should also take into consideration the children's interest and level of cognitive development
 is prakaar paalankarta bacchon ko khel ke madhyam se rang, aakaar, ank, mausam, vibhinn prakaar kii chidiyon or paudhon ityadi ke bare main jaanane main madad kar sakati he
 Children are also familiar with concepts such as short, long and thin, light and heavy by sports
 jis prakaar gyanatmak vikaas ke liye paalankarta ko kriyalap yojit karnaa he usee prakaar anya kshetron main vikaas protsaahit karne ke liye bhi paalankarta ko vikaas anusaar kriyalap yojit karne chahie
 Children play different roles through imagination in the game
 aisa karte hue unki buddhi or vyavhaar usee vyakti ke anusaar hota he jinaki vah bhoomika kar rahe hai
 For this reason, they also display the thoughts and feelings of those individuals
 naatak karnaa bacchon ke khel kaa ek abhinn hissaa he
 In the game, the girl is cut off from reality and creates many more
 ek tuuti plate teen varshiya balika ke liye teble ban jaati he or ek das varshiya balak ke liye antariksh yaan
 The row of matchboxes becomes a train, and while playing on this train, the children pretend to cross the river passing through the jungle and fight the dacoits
 aap yah dekhakar hairaan ho jaaenge ki rail patari par na chal sadak par hi chal rahi he
 It is not necessary that the game should be realistic
 khel kalpana shakti ko viksit karata he or yah bacchon ko dainik sthitiyon se jujhane main madad karata he
 Development of physical and functional skills depends on practice
 khel aisi kriya he jo bacchon ko abhyaas ke paryaapt avasar pradaan karti he
 When a mother puts a tingle in front of a four-month-old baby
 shishu kaa dhyaan jhunjhuna kii taraf aakarshith hota he or vah apni peeth se pet par palat kar us tak pahunchne kii koshish karata he
 To do this, muscle coordination is necessary
 baar-baar jhunjhune tak pahunchne ke prayaas main shishu ko mitti khaane kaa avasar miltaa he or dhire-dhire vah aasaani se kar letaa he
 Children develop a lot of muscle coordination when they try to walk on a row of bricks, climb a wall, climb a ladder, hang in swings, play running games, ride a bicycle
 khel-khel main jameen main gadde khodne, phulon ke haar banane, chitra banane or unamem rang bharne main bacchon kii laghu mansapeshiyon kaa vikaas hota he
 Children learn to speak in sports and games
 yah to spasht he ki bhashaa jaanane ke liye unka bhashaa ko sun paanaa or bol paanaa aavashyak he
 In humorous actions with the follower, the child has many opportunities to listen to the language which motivates her to speak
 jab balika kareeb nau maheene kii hoti he tab vah ‘‘ga ga ga‘‘, ‘‘be be be‘‘, ‘‘maa maa maa‘‘, ‘‘mam mam‘‘, jaise kai swar nikaalati he
 Some of these are the introduction of the language of adults
 is antah kriya ke dauraan balika vibhinn dhvaniyon ke bich bolnaa sikhti he
 This ability later helps her distinguish words like "abba" and "amma" and she recognizes them as separate words
 bachche chaukor, gol, sidhi or vakr rekha jaisi vibhinn akritiyon ko bhi samajhane lagate hai jo baad main unhen bhinn aksharon ko pahchaanane main madad karte hai
 Children playing see that the black and red circle or the small and big circle are all circular
 isse unhen samajhane main madad milegi ki ‘k‘ akshar ‘k‘ hi rahata he chahen vah shabd ke shuru main ho yaa ant main
 In the game she learns the meaning of concepts such as before and after, left and right, up and down, which are essential for learning to write and read
 aapane yah dekha ki khel kriyaatmak vikaas main sahaayak hote hai jo ki likhnaa seekhney ke liye aavashyak hota he
 We know that children learn instinctively what they are interested in
 yah baat likhnaa or padhanaa seekhney ke liye bhi satya he
 Listening to stories will inculcate in children the desire to read them and will inspire them to read and write
 agar balika ko likhnaa nahin aata or paalankarta us par likhane ke liye dabaav daalati he to sambhavtah likhnaa seekhney kii prakriya ko yadi khel bana diya jaae jisamen balika jameen par likhe hue ‘k‘ par chote-chote pathar rakhe, uski ruparekha par chale yaa ‘k‘ akshar ke binduon ko jod kar ‘k‘ likhe to vah dhire-dhire ‘k‘ kii ruparekha se parichit ho jaaegi
 In this way she will also enjoy and she will learn to write without pressure
 jab maan shishu ko nahalaati he, kapade pahanaati he, sulaati he or uski anya sabhi aavashyaktaaon kaa dhyaan rakhti he to in antahkriyaaon ke dauraan balika maan ko pahchaanane lagati he
 His attachment to his mother also increases
 yah shishu kaa pehla saamaajik sambandh he, jiskaa uske bhavi sambandhon par bhi gaharaa prabhaav padataa he
 In the early years of life, the girl plays with her hands and feet and with the surrounding objects
 isse shishu ko yah pataa chalata he ki uskaa sharir aasapaas kii vastuon se alag he
 Through such experiences he develops his perception of himself
 vah yah samajhane lagati he ki rone par maan uske paas aegi, jab vah hansegi to maan bhi hansegi or use god main uthaa legi
 As the girl grows up she plays with other children
 unke saath khelte hue aapas main chijen baantna, niyamon kaa paalan karnaa, apni baari kii pratiksha karnaa sikhti he
 In this way she also learns to take into account other people's viewpoints and value them
 khelte samay bachche aksar vayaskon kii nakal karte hai
 In this way learn appropriate behaviors and the roles that they must play when they grow up
 khelte hue paraspar kriya main ve vibhinn prakaar ke kaaryon, tyohaaron, dharanaon ke bare main jaankaree praapt karte hai
 Sports activities provide children with an opportunity to express joy, gaiety, anger, fear and sorrow
 khel main kuch bhi manachaaha karne kii chhot hoti he basharten ki usase kisi ko haani na pahunche
 The game gives an opportunity to express emotions and emotions that cannot be expressed in other situations
 udhaahrantah khel main pita kii bhoomika kaa abhinay karte hue balika duusare bachche ko apni ajna kaa paalan karne ke liye kah sakati he
 He may not do this in other situations
 ladaai kaa drishy khelte samay vah jor se chilla sakati he, vastuen idhar-udhar patake sakati he jisaki anumati use aamtaur par nahin milti
 Latent emotions emerge from the game
 isiilie khel un bacchon ke liye upachaar yaa chikitsa he jo paristhiti ke anusaar saamaanya bhaavnaatmak pratikriya nahin darshaate
 Games help children in development and prepare them for future roles
 khel-khel main sikhi gai sankalpanaayen padhane-likhane ke kaushal or samooh khel main hissaa lene kii kshamta tathaa baad main skool main samaayojan main madad karte hai
 Therefore, sports are helpful in preparing for formal education
 khel prashn poochne or khojbin karne kii manovriti ko bhi pariposhit karata he
 As children learn new things and become proficient in them, they become confident about themselves
 yah badhata hua aatm-vishwaas unhen chunautiyaan sweekaar karne ke liye taiyaar karata he

 The national flag of India, also known as the tricolor, is a flag embellished by a circle of blue between three horizontal stripes of color
 isaki abhiklpana pingali vankaiya ne kii thi
 It was adopted on 15 August 1947, in a meeting of the Indian Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, just a few days before India's independence from the British
 isamen teen samaan chaudaai kii kshaitij pattiyaan hai, jinamein sabase upar kesaria, bich main shwet ore neeche gahare hare rang kii pattee he
 The ratio of the length and width of the flag is 3: 2
 safed pattee ke madhya main gahare nile rang kaa ek chakra he jisamen 24 aare hote hai
 The diameter of this chakra is approximately equal to the width of the white band and the form is similar to that seen in the circle of the lion head of the Ashoka Pillar at Sarnath
 bhartiya rashtradhvaj apane aap mai hi bharat kii niti ko darshata hua dikhaai detaa he
 Towards Self Defense, Peace, Prosperity and Forever Development
 rashtriya jhanda nirdishtikaran ke anusaar jhanda khadimen hi bananaa chahie
 It is made from a special type of hand-cut cloth made popular by Mahatma Gandhi
 in sabhi vishistataaon ko vyapak rup se bharat main sammaan diya jaataa hai bhartiya dhvaj samhita ke dwaara iske pradarshan or prayog par vishesh niyantran he
 The heraldic description of the flag is as follows: gandhi ji ne sabase pehle 1921 main congress ke apane jhande kii baat kii thi
 This flag was designed by Pingali Venkaiah
 isamen do rang the laal rang hinduon ke liye or haraa rang muslimon ke liye
 There was a circle in the middle
 baad main isamen anya dharmo ke liye safed rang joda gaya
 a few days before the independence, the Constituent Assembly revised the national flag
 isamen charakhe kii jagah ashok chakra ne lee
 This new flag was reinterpreted by the country's second president Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan
 21 feet guna 14 feet ke jhande puure desh main keval teen kilon ke upar fahraae jate hai

 For the first time in 1951, the Bureau of Indian Standards laid down certain rules for the national flag
 1968 main tirangaa nirmaan ke maanak tay kiye gaye
 These rules are very stringent
 keval khaadi yaa haath se kata gaya kapadaa hi jhanda banane ke liye upyog kiya jaataa he
 From the weaving of the cloth to the making of the flag, it is tested many times
 jhanda banane ke liye do tarah kii khaadi kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 One is the khadi that makes cloth and the other is khadi-tat
 khaadi ke keval kapaas, resham or oon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Even its weaving is different from normal weaving
 ye bunai behad durlabh hoti he
 It is only known by less than a dozen people from across the country
 dharwan ke nikat gadag or karnataka ke bagalkot main hi khaadi kii bunai kii jaati he
 While "hubli" is the only licensed institution from where flag production and supply is done
 bunai se lekar bazaar main pahunchane tak kai baar biies prayogshaalaon main iskaa pareekshan hota he
 After weaving the material is sent for testing
 kade gunvattta pareekshan ke baad use waapas kaarkaane bhej diya jaataa he
 After that it is painted in three colors
 centre main ashok chakra ko kadha jaataa he
 It is then sent for testing again
 biies jhande kii jaanch karata he iske baad hi ise bazaar main bechney ke liye bheja jaataa he
 This flag was built during the freedom struggle of India

 The upper strip of the national flag of India has a saffron color that shows the strength and courage of the country
 bich kii pattee kaa shwet dharm chakra ke saath shanti or satya kaa pratik he
 The lower green stripe shows fertility, growth and the purity of the land
 safed pattee par bane chakra ko dharm chakra kehete hai
 This Dharma Chakra is called the wheel of law which is derived from Sarnath's lot made by the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC
 is chakra main 24 aare yaa tiliyon kaa arth he ki din- raatri ke 24 ghante jivan gatisheel he or rukne kaa arth mrityu he
 The Indian flag uses the following approximate color transfer
 dhvaj main jo kesaria, shwet, haraa tathaa nila rang he vah achtmal aar
