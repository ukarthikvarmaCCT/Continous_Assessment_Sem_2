 kehete hai ki jab swami ji 1872 main kalakatta main keshavachandra sen se mili to unhone swami ji ko yah salaah di ki aap sanskrit chhodkar hindi bolnaa armbh kar den to bharat kaa aseem kalyaan ho
 Since then, the language of Swami ji's lectures became Hindi and perhaps for this reason Swamiji also kept the language of Satyarth Prakash as Hindi
 swami ji puure desh main gum-ghumkar shastrarth evam vyaakhyaan kar rahe the
 With this, his followers requested that if these texts and lectures were written down, they would become immortal
 satyarth prakaash kii rachana unke anuyaayiyon ke is anurodh ke kaaran hi sambhav hui
 The main objective of the creation of Satyarth Prakash was to propagate the principles of Arya Samaj

 purana mandir varsh 1984 kii hindi bhashaa main bani ek harser film he, jiskaa nirmaan evam nirdesan ramse bandhuon dwaara kiya gaya he
 The story of this horror film describes Samari, the devil demon
 film kaa sangeet ajit singh ne sajaayaa he
 The film originates 200 years ago from Bijapur, the Sultanate of Raja Harman Singh, near which a black hill is situated
 raja apni priy beti rajkumaari rupali ke gaayab hone se pareshaan he jahaan par shaitan-pujari samari kaa nivas-sthaan he
 Where the princess wanders through the old fort and the evil Samaritan abducts her and tortures her
 apane shikaar ke liye vishesh taur par pahchaan ke liye vah peedit ko jaahir he apni aankhon ke jariye bebas karata he, jahaan uski saamaanya ankhen shaitani mudra main aakar safed pad jaati he
 And during this process, the Samaritan's eyes would turn red in blood
 raja harmansingh is dehshat ko khatm karne samari kaa pakadaney kaa nirnay karte hai or sipaahiyon se uski dhar-pakad kaa hukum dete hai
 The Samaritan is placed on the muscle, where a list of cruel crimes is read
 usne aise kai vibhats or jaghanya kukarmon ko anjaam diya taaki uskaa mahadusht guru shaitan ko khush ho tathaa apni shaktiyon kaa vistaar kar sake
 He led and raped many newly married brides and ripped their entrails; Handicapped innocent nuns and children and devoured her flesh; Along with that - one of his most shocking accusations ever read was that of digging up dead bodies and sacrificing and devouring them; And the settlements around Bijapur spread the secret of Satan with its awe
 isi ke saath raajpurohit apradhi samari ko pavitra agni main dah-sanskaar karaane kaa suzav dete he, magar raja kaa praayojan kuch or hi rahata he — ki samari kaa sir dhad se kaat diya jaae, jahaan uske sirviheen dhad ko kaali ghat ke puraane mandir peeche dafnaaya jaae or sir ko majboot-sandook main bandakar raja kii haveli main rakhaa jaae
 The trunk of Lord Shiva is also kept on the advice of the Rajpurohit, by tying that box with hard chains, so that the devil remains like this
 haalaanki marane se purv samari ant main raja ko shraap dete hue kahata he: "jitani der tak meraa sir mere dhad se alag raheg, tumhaare har bachche ko janane vaali aurat jinda nahin rahegi; or jab meraa sar mere sharir se judega, main phir jivit ho uthunga or tumhaare kutumbo ke harek shaks kaa safaya kar doongaa !" As the years pass, the princely states are merged with the Indian republics, and Raja Hariman Singh's great-grandson, Thakur Ranveer Singh, now resides in the city
 samari kaa bhi lanbaa vakt bitta he, magar ab bhi use bhulaayaa nahin gaya
 It was his satanic wrath that continued from father to son Badastur Harman Singh's clan, and his wretched curse repeated with every generation
 ranvir singh kii patni bhi unki beti suman ko janm dekar sidhaar gai
 Suman, now a college student, has a boyfriend Sanjay and the two young love couples spend most of their time in the pool, on the ocean shore, and in nightclubs
 vahiin jab thakur ko unke is rishte kii khabar hoti he, to vah jaahir taur par is sambandh kaa kathorta se naamanzoori dete he isliye ki sanjay kisi rajasi gharaane kaa nahin he
 Suman is unaware of his family curse and stubborn about his love, and Sanjay is also determined to get it
 ve thakur se is naaraazgi vajah kii jaanane kii koshish main unase milte hai or yaheen se unhen us manahuus shraap kaa rahasy samaj aata he jo pichley 200 saalon se unke khandaan main khauf samaaya he
 Sanjay finally realizes the mood of Suman's father and returns without Suman
 haalaanki suman aadhi raat ko apane ghar se nikalati he or sanjay ke saath bijapur chalane ko manaati he taaki vahaan chaanbin kar sake or, yadi mumkin hua to is tahakiqaat ke saath is manahoosiyat daag ko chhudaa kar apane pyaar par lage shaitani baadha kaa bhi ant kar sakenge
 In this way, they also take Sanjay's hearty friend Anand and his wife Sapna along on their journey to Bijapur
 bijapur tak kaa unka pehla safar khataron se bharaa hota he
 At the wheel of his car, he is punctured, while he is met by a witch-looking woman Mangli and his mysterious son Durjan, who is the watchman and cook of the mansion of former king Harman Singh
 vahiin uski dosti ek besange lakadahare sanga se hoti he jinako gupt rup se vishwaas he ki is haveli main khajaana kahin dafan he
 The walls of the mansion are studded with pictures of King Harim Singh; At the same time, Suman finds those pictures as if she is staring at them; And from this fear, it feels as if the Samaritan himself is watching them
 vahiin aise kai daraavne ghatnaayen bhi hoti he par kisi tarah anand or sanjay milakar tasviir peeche kii diwaar todakar vah sandook pate hai jisamen samari kaa kataa hua sir rakhaa he
 They misunderstand that the head must be a fearless soldier, who is suffering the punishment for disobeying the king
 is tarah diwaar bharne kaa khyaal agle din ke liye chhod detaa he
 Unfortunately Sanga and Durjan notice this whole incident
 sanga, jo pehle hi khajaane ko dekhne ke liye jhukaa hua tha, apane lobh ko dabaata he or us par se trishul hataata he
 The half-dead head of the Samaritan enchants her as if to lead her to the tomb
 sanga us sir ko dhad se jodne ke liye puraane mandir tak pahunchataa he or is judaav kii bhayanak prakriya ke liye vah chaaku se apana haath katkar apana khun us samari kii gardan par giraata he, samari puraa hota he
 The hatred of the past 200 years, Samaritan now brutally murders King Herman Singh's children, and once again falls in the slum like Satanic Raj
 kasbe ke logon ke paas shaitan kii satta swikaarne ke alaava or koi vikalp nahin bachataa
 Like many residents of the towns, there is an atmosphere of rumor and tension and Anand also dies a terrible death at the hands of Samaritan
 abhi vah log is bhayanak hamale jhel rahe the jab tak thakur ranvir singh naa pahunche the
 He was right with the relationships of those great personalities, but he also did not suggest any way how to defeat this blood thirsty Samaritan
 is hataasha main, bastivasi mandir main sharan paane ko majaboor hote hai or samari khud pavitra jagah par pravesh nahin kar saktaa tha
 They offer prayers to Lord Shiva
 vahiin sanjay ke aane se pehle ek divine maargdarshan miltaa; vah trishul hi ekmaatr kunjee he jisase us rakshas ko roka ja saktaa he
 Sanjay and Suman run to the mansion running to get that trident, Samaris can be challenged to fight
 par in sabase anjaan, durjan us trishul ko haveli ke kisi ore jagah hataa detaa he
 Sanjay and Suman are trapped in the mansion when the bloodpipus Samaritan was already on the hunt for a hunt
 aakhirkaar is uthal-puthal bhare hangaamon ke silsile baad, sanjay kisi tarah samari ko phaanste hue tabut le aata he or, phir haathon main trishul lekar us rakshas par kaabo jamaate hue, use gaanv ke chauraahey tak ghaseetata he 
 At the same time, her funeral pyre is prepared and the Samaritan is burnt alive and killed
 kuch dinon baad suman or sanjay kii aapas main shaadi hoti he or suman kaa parivaar phir khushiyon se bhar jaataa he
 The following list of complete music included in the film is as follows: sakriy smriti kisi bhi kaary ko sikhte samay sakriy rahati he
 If we read any article or see anything, then this memory remains active
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi ham kisi vastu ke bare main pard rahe hai or hame usase hi judaa koi sawaal poocha jaataa he to is sawaal kaa jawaab sabhi log baaki samay kii apeksha jaldi denge
 This is called active memory

 anuwaad kaa daawa he ki prayek praakrit padaarth anuon se bana he or padaarthon kaa bananaa tathaa tootna anuon ke sanyog viyog kaa hi doosraa naam he
 In ancient times, atomism was a major subject of philosophical discussion, but scientists did not accept it
 iske vipareet, aadhunik kaal main darshanik isaki ore se udasin rahe hai, parantu bhautikee ke liye anu kii banaavat or prakriya adhyayan kaa pramukh vishay ban gai he
 In India, Vaishika philosophy has given special consideration to the molecule
 prakruti ke vibhaajan main anu param yaa ant he, vibhaajan isse aage ja nahin saktaa
 According to Dimakritas, each molecule carries the result and shape, but there is no caste discrimination among them
 yahi lucipus kaa bhi mat tha
 Ampidoclose observed racial differences in earth, water and fire molecules
 anuon kaa sanyog viyog gati par nirbhar he or gati shunya main hi ho sakati he
 Ancient atomism along with primordial molecules also accepted the existence of a void

 guneet anupaat kaa niyam anuwaad kii pushti karata he
 When two different molecules come in a chemical combination, when one of them remains in the real volume, the other molecule is 2,3,4
 
 
 It is available only in units, 212, 334 etc
 in quantities

 The first five matter among the nine liquids are earth, water, light, air and sky

 In this view, Vaiseshika does not meet Dimakritas, but Empedoclees

 Some believe that all existence emerges solely from the unmanifest prakr^iti, while others believe that it emerges from the always manifest prakr^iti
 Avyaktān if wa express dvaयीimath chatushtayim

 Whether it emerges from the manifest, or the unmanifest, or a combination of two principles or of four principles, the knowers term the basis of all existence to be prakr ^ iti seyan prakrutiravyakta kalabhirvyakttaan gata 
 Ego twinkle Rajendra these archetypes:

 Myself and yourself, oh indra of the rajanyas, and other entities that occupy space are as result of prakr^iti

 a point formed by the union the spermatic and female principles is beginning of our existence
 It then transforms itself into the primary embryonic globule called kalala kalaladarbudotpattih peshi chapyarbudodbhava 
 Peshyāsatvāngābhānivrittīrānākhāramāniिi changat 

 117 

 The kalala divides to a state with numerous bubbles called, and the arbuda gives rise to an elongated sheath like form 
 From the peshi, emerges the a~nga, where the rudiments of all the organs are seen, from this form differentiates the external elements like hair and nails
 Sampoorna ninth Masse Jantorjatasya Maithil

 When a being issues forth from the womb it has nails and fingers of the hue of blood
 The next step is infancy when the form seen at birth changes
 Kaumaradhyauvanam Chappi Stranger anen kramyogen purvan purvan na labhyate

 from infancy, youth is reached and from that old age is reached
 As the creature advances from stage to stage irreversibly, there is constant change in the body
 kalanaa pruthagarthana pratibhedah kshane kshane 
 Vartate sarvabhuteshu saक्ष्मmakhyattu na vibhaतेyate 

 121 

 This is because the body is made of minute particles which serve diverse functions and undergo changes, that are hard to perceive from second to second
 Neither Chashampyayo Rajallakshyate Prabhavo nor Ch
 avasthaayamavasthaayaan dipasyevarchisho gatih 

 122

 The birth and death of these particles is continous, with one leading to the other, just as the changes in flame of a burning lamp, oh King

 Thus is the existence of the body of all creatures, with their elements constantly in rapid locomotion like a good horse in run
 Ever state comes and goes

 According to the custom of royal dynasty, a woman named Catherine Peebles was appointed as a teacher and she was educated under the age of 5 to 8 years

 The prince then enrolled at his father's former school, Chim Preparatory School, which was located in Berkshire, England and eventually moved to Gordonstown, in the north-east of Scotland
 Prince reportedly dislikes the time spent at the latter school - which Charles has expressed as "colditz in kilt" - although he spent two of his time at the Timbertop Campus of Geelong Grammar School in Geelong, Australia
 During this, he traveled to Papua New Gunia with his mentor Michael Collins Parse as part of his history-related journey
 After his return to Gordonstown, Charles became a head boy, imitating his father and left school in 1967 with two a levels in history and French

 "however, this proposal could not come to fruition due to a combination of nationalist sentiment in Australia and the dismissal of the government by the Governor General in 1975
 Charles reportedly accepted the Australian ministers' decision with little regret: "what would you think when you're ready to do something to help and then you're told you don't need to?"

 It literally means Lord Eternal's abode

 ek internet protocol adress ek sankhyatmak label he jo apane nodes ke bich sanchaar ke liye internet protocol kaa prayog karanevaale computer network main bhaag le rahe divices ko abantit kiya jaataa he
 An IP address performs two major functions: host or network interface identification and location detection
 The characterization of its role is as follows: “A name indicates what we ask for
 ek pataa ingit karata he ki vah kahan he
 a route indicates how to get there
 " TCP / IP ke diziner ne IP adress ko ek 32-bit nambar ke rup main paribhaashit kiya or internet protocal varjan 4 yaa ipv4 ke naam se jaani janevaali yah pranali, aaj bhi upyog main he
 However, due to the extensive development of the Internet and consequently the lack of available addresses, a new detection system using 128 bits for addresses was developed in 1995 and last standardized by RFC 2460 in 1998
 haalanki IP adress dwiadhari sankhya ke rup main jamaa kiye jate he, vah aamtaur par maanviya-pathyogy chihnkaree jaise 208
77
188
166 or 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:1:1 main pradarshit kiye jate hai
 The Internet protocol also sends data packets between networks; The IP address specifies the location of the source and destination nodes in the topology of the routing system
 is prayojan ke liye, ek IP adress ke kuch bits ek sab-network abhinihit karne ke liye istemaal kiye jate hai
 The number of these bits is indicated in CIDR notation, appended to the IP address, such as 208
77
188
166 / 24
 jaise hi nijee network ke vikaas ne ipv4 adress ke samaapan ke khatre ko uthaaya, RFC 1918 ne nijee adress sthaan kaa ek samooh nirdhaarit kiya jo nijee network par kisi ke bhi dwaara istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 They are often used with network address translators to connect to the global public Internet
 da internet asind number athurity, jo saarvbhaumik IP adress sthaan niyatan prabandh karata he, sthaneey internet registry or anya sansthaaon ko IP khand aabantan karne ke liye, paanch kshetreey internet registry ko sahyog detaa he
 Two versions of the Internet protocol are in use: IP version 4 and IP version 6
 See version history
) Each version defines an IP address differently
 uski vyapaktaa ke kaaran, saamaanya shabd ypi adress aam taur par ab bhi ipv4 dwaara paribhaashit adress ko sanderbhit karata he
 ipv4 uses a 32-bit address, which limits the address space to 4,294,967,296) possible unique addresses
 ipv4 kuch adress, vishesh prayojanon jaise nijee network yaa bahustrpiya adress ke liye arakshit karata he
 This reduces the number of addresses to be assigned to end-users and as the number of available addresses decays, ipv4 address completion becomes fixed
 yah purvaabhaasi kami ipv6 viksit karne ke liye praathmik prerana thi, jo duniya bhar main vibhinn tainaati charnon main he or ipv4 pratisthaapan or internet ke lagaataar vistaar ke liye akeli ranneeti he
 ipv4 addresses are usually represented in dot-decimal notation
 prayek bhaag adress ke 8 bit kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or isliye ocotate kahalaaya jaataa he
 In less common cases of technical writing, ipv4 addresses can be presented in hexadecimal, octal, or binary representations
 sarvaadhik pratinidhitiv main prayek ocotate vyaktigat rup se badla jaataa he
 In the initial phase of Internet Protocol development, network administrators described the IP address in two parts, the network number portion and the host number portion
 The highest order octet in an address was designated a network number, and the remaining bits were called rest fields or host identifiers and were used for internal host numbering of the network
 yah paddati jald hi annuroop sabit hui jaise hi atirikt network viksit hue jo maujuuda network se svachhand the, jinhen pehle se hi ek network sankhya dwaara abhinihit kiya hota tha
 In 1981, the Internet addressing specification was revised with the inclusion of a classful network structure
 classphul network dizine ek badi sankhya ke liye vyaktigat network kaary kii anumati detaa tha
 The first three bits of the most important octet of an IP address were defined as a range of addresses
 saarvbhaumik unicast parichayan ke liye teen shreneeyaan paribhaashit kii gai
 Network identification based on derived class was based on octet boundary areas of the entire address
 prayek shrenee network pahachanakarta main kramshah atirikt octate kaa upyog karti thi, is prakaar se ucch varg shrenee main sambhav mejabaanon kii sankhya kam ho jaati he
 The following table gives an overview of the system thus obsolete
 'sabanetwork' or 'classphul network' lekh main is abhikalp kaa vivaran samajhaayaa gaya he
 Although the classful network design was a successful developmental stage, wild Internet expansion made it difficult to move forward and when classless inter-domain routing was created to provide new IP address segments and use ipv4 addresses for routing protocols
 When new rules were prepared for, it was dropped
 swecchit-lambaai upsargon kaa aabantan evam anumaargan karwaane ke liye siidiar veriable-lenth sabanet masking par aadhaarit he
 Today, the residuals of the classful network concept operate only in a limited area, which is the default configuration parameter of some network software and hardware components and is used in technical discussions of network administrators
 aarambhik network abhikalp main jab sanchaar ke liye sabhi internet prayogkartaaon ke bich vaishvik str par ek chaur se duusare chaur tak jodne kii baat sochi gai to yah lakshya tha ki prayek computer yaa upkaran kaa ek vishisht ypi pataa ho
 But it was found that it is not always possible to do so as private networks developed and public addresses needed to be conserved
 jo computer internet se nahin jude hai, jaise ki kaarkaane kii mashine jo tisipi / ypi ke madhyam se keval aapas main sanchaar karti hai, unke liye vaishvik taur par vishisht ypi pataa hona jaruri nahin he
 For private networks three of the ipv4 addresses, one limit for each class, were reserved in the 1918 RFC
 in paton kaa margan internet par nahin kiya jaataa or isliye inkaa prayog ypi paton kii panji ke saath samanvit karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Today, when needed, such private networks usually connect to the Internet through network address translation
 koi bhi upyogkarta kisi bhi arakshit blaak kaa upyog kar sakate hai
 Typically, a network administrator splits a segment into subnets, for example, many home enrollers automatically use a left address range of 192
168

0 - 192

 ypi sanskaran 4 pate kaa sthaan teji se apane aadhikarik taur par uplabdh abantit pate ke khandon ke samaapan par pahunch rahaa he
 Despite the preservation techniques, the rapid completion of the ipv4 address space prompted the Internet Engineering Task Force to explore new technologies to expand the Internet's addressing capabilities
 iskaa sthaayee samaadhaan, internet protocol kaa hi ek nayaa swaroop, samajha tha
 This next generation of Internet Protocol, intended to replace ipv4 on the Internet, was eventually renamed Internet Protocol version 6 in 1995
 pataa aakaar 32 se badha kar 128 bit yaa 16 ocotate kar diya gaya, jo, network block ke ek udaar kaam ke saath bhi, nikat bhavishya ke liye paryaapt mana jaataa he
 Mathematically, the new address space provides a capacity of up to 2, or approximately 3
403 × 10 unique addresses
 nayaa dizin keval adress kii paryaapt maatra pradaan karne ke lakshya par aadhaar nahin he, balki sabanet anumaargan upsargon ke kushal ekatrikaran ko anumaargan nodes par hone kii anumati dene ke liye
 As a result, the routing table size is small and the smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 264 hosts, which is square of the size of the entire ipv4 Internet
 in staron par, vaastavik adress upyog dar kisi bhi ipv6 network khand par chota hoga
 The new design also provides the opportunity to isolate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment — which is the local administration of the segment's available space — from an addressing prefix used to route external traffic to a network
 ipv6 main aisi suvidhaayen he jo, yadi vaishvik sampark yaa anumaargan niti main parivartan ho, to bina aantarik nae swaroop yaa nae sankhyankan ke swatah hi puure network kaa anumaargan upsarg badal detii hai
 The large number of ipv6 addresses allows large blocks to be specified for specific purposes and, where appropriate, to be aggregated for efficient routing
 ek bade adress sthaan ke saath ek jatil pataa sangrakshan takanic kii jarurat nahin hoti, jaise clasles inter-domen rooting main upyog kii jaati he
 According to Submodern, desktop and enterprise server operating systems include seamless support for the ipv6 protocol, but are not yet widely deployed in other devices such as home networking routers, voice over internet protocols, and multimedia devices and network peripherals
 ek ipv6 pate kaa udhaaharan: As ipv4 reserves addresses for private or internal networks, ipv6 has separate sets of addresses for private addresses
 ipv6 main, in ko unic local adress ke naam se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 RFC 4,193 sets the routing prefix fc00 :: / 7 separately for this department, which is divided into two / 8 departments with different available policies
 The address includes a 40-bit pseudorandom number of site mergers or packets
 Addresses on the wrong route reduce the risk of encounter
 aarambhik dizin is prayojan ke liye ek alag khand kaa prayog karte the, dabd site-sthaneey adress
 haalanki, site kaa gathan kis se hota he, isaki paribhaasha aspasht rahi or kharaab paribhaashit parichayan niti ne anumaargan main sandigdhta bana di
 The address range specification has been abandoned and should no longer be used in the new system
 fe80 se shuru hote pate: - link-local adress kahalaaye jane vaale - keval sthaneey link kshetra main niyat kiye jate hai
 Addresses are usually generated automatically by the IP layer of the operating system for each network interface
 yah kisi bhi ipv6 mejabaan ke liye tatkaal swat: network sanyojaktaa pradaan karata he or iskaa matlab he ki yadi kai mejabaan ek aam hub yaa switch se judate hai to unke link sthaneey ipv6 adress dwaara unhen ek sheeghra sanchaar maarg miltaa he
 This feature is used extensively and indirectly for most users in the lower layers of ipv6 network administration
 saarvajanik internet main koi bhi nijee adress upsarg nahin bheja ja saktaa
 The technique of subnetting can work in both ipv4 and ipv6 networks
 ypi adress do bhaagon main vibhajit he: network adress or host idantifire 
 sabanet mask yaa CIDR upsarg nirdhaarit karata he ki kaise IP adress network or host bhaagon main vibhajit he
 The term subnet mask is only used in ipv4
 halanki donon ypi sanskaran, classles inter-domen rooting kii avadharana or sanketan kaa upyog karte hai
 In this, there is a slash behind the IP address and the number of bits used for the network part, also called the route prefix
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek ipv4 adress or uskaa sabanet mask kramshah 192

0 ho saktaa he
 The CIDR notation for the same IP address and subnet mask is 192

1 / 24, as the first 24 bits of the IP address encode the network and subnet
 jab ek computer har baar ek hi ai pi adress kaa prayog karne ke liye samanurup kiya jaataa he to vah tej ho jaataa he, ise static IP adress kehete hai
 Conversely, in cases when the computer's IP address is assigned automatically, it is known as a dynamic IP address
 static IP adress ek vyavasthaapak dwaara haath se computer ko saunpa he
 Its exact process varies by platform
 yah dinemic ai pi adress se asaadrishy hai, jo yaa to computer interphes yaa swayam host software, jaise xeronkonf main, dwaara nirdisht hote he yaa dinemic host kanfigreshna protocol ke istemaal se ek sarwar dwaara nirdisht kiye hote he
 Although IP addresses specified using DHCP remain the same for long periods of time, they can usually change
 kuch maamalon main, ek network vyavasthaapak sakriy rup se nirdisht static IP adress lagu kar saktaa hai
 In this case, a DHCP server is used, but it is specifically tailored to always assign the same IP address to a specific computer
 yah static IP adress ko mukhya rup se samanurup hone kii anumati detaa he, jisamen network par prayek computer ko hastchalit pranali dwaara vishesh rup se samanurup karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin padati
 In the absence or failure of a static or stateful address configuration, an operational system can assign an IP address to a network interface using state-less automatic-configuration techniques, such as Xeroconf
 gatisheel ypi pate dinemic host kanfigareshan protocol sarvaron dwaara atyadhik praayah lans or broadband network par niyukt hote hai
 They are used because they can avoid the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses for each device on a network
 yah kai upkarnon ko ek network par simit adress sthaan main sahabhaagi banane kii anumati bhi detaa he, par keval yadi un main se kuch kisi vishesh samay par online hon
 kai vartmaan desktop oparating system main, gatisheel ypi vinyas difolt rup se sakasham kiya hota he taaki ek upyogkarta ko DHCP sarwar ke saath ek network se judane ke liye apane haath se koi settings darj karne kii aavashyaktaa naa pade
 gatisheel IP adress nirdisht karne ke liye DHCP hi akeli takanic nahin he
 Dialup and some broadband networks use dynamic address characteristics of point-to-point protocols
 ek stick dinemic IP adress yaa stick ypi cabel or DSL internet adhigam bhugtankarta dwaara ek gatyaatmakataa se niyukt ypi adress jisamen aksar badlaav nahin aata, uskaa varnan karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Addresses are usually assigned with the DHCP protocol
 chunki modem aamtaur par vistaarit avadhi ke samay ke liye yantrachaalit hote hai, isliye adress patte aksar lambey samay ke liye niyamit kiye jate hai or samaapti hone par naveekrut kar die jate hai
 If a modem is turned off and the address is re-operated before the next termination of the lease, it is most likely that it will receive the same IP address
 RFC 3330 ipv4 networkon ke liye sthaneey-link adressing main vishesh upyog karne ke liye adress block, 169
254
0
0 / 16, paribhaashit karata he
 In ipv6, each interface using static or dynamic address functions automatically receives a local-link address in the fe80 :: / 10 subnet
 ye adress keval link par vaid hote hai, jaise ek sthaneey network khand yaa binduvaar conection jisase koi host judaa hua ho
 These addresses are not routable and cannot be the source or destination of Internet packet blocking like private addresses
 jab sthaneey-link ipv4 adress block arakshit hua tha, adress swachaalit-samakriti ke tantra ke liye koi bhi maanak astitv main nahin tha
 Filling the void, Microsoft created an implementation called automatic private IP addressing
 microsoft kii vipanan kshamta ke kaaran APIPA ko lakhon mashiinon par tainaat kiya gaya he or, is prakaar yah udyog main ek vaastavik maanak ban gaya he
 Many years later, the IETF defined a formal standard for this functionality, RFC 3927, as the official configuration of the local-link address ipv4
 kuch buniyadi dhaanchon ko sthitik adress upyog karnaa aavashyak he, jaise ki domen naam pranali kaa host praapt karne par jo domen naam ko IP adress main badal detaa he
 Static address is also convenient to set up a server in an enterprise, but not at all necessary
 DNS sarwar se praapt kiya gaya ek adress apane jeevankaal, yaa kaishing samay ke saath aata he, jiske baad isamen badlaav nahin aayaa, isaki pushti karne ke liye yah dekha janaa chahie
 Even static IP addresses change as a result of network management
 today ke anusaar internet par fyrwal aam hai
 For increased network security, they control access to private networks based on the customer's public IP
 kaali suchi prayog kar rahe ho yaa safed suchi, jo IP adress avaruddh hota he, vah graahak kaa kathith saarvajanik ypi adress hota he, matlab yadi graahak proxi sarwar yaa NAT istemaal kar rahaa ho to ek IP adress kaa avrodh karne se kai alag alag log avaruddh ho sakate hai
 Multiple client tools can be displayed to use an IP address: either because it is part of a shared hosting web server environment or because an ipv4 network address translator or proxy server acts as an intermediary on behalf of its clients In this case, the actual IP address generated may be hidden from the server receiving the request
 ek nijee network main NAT kaa ek badi sankhya main IP adress ko chhipaana ek aam kaary pranali he
 Only "external" interfaces of NAT require an Internet routable address
 sabase saamaanya net upkaran bahari ore TCP yaa UDP port sankhya maanchitr karte hai or bhitari bhaag main vyaktigat nijee adress ko
 Just as a telephone number may have a site-specific extension, port numbers are a site-specific extension for an IP address
 chote gharelu network main, NAT kaary aam taur par ek awasaiya pravesh-dwaar divaais main hote hai, vishisht rup se ek "router" ke rup main bechaa jaataa he
 In this scenario, the computer connected to the router will have a 'private' IP address and the router will have a government address to communicate with the Internet
 is prakaar kaa router, kai computer ko ek saarvajanik ai pi pataa baantne kii anumati detaa he
 In Windows the IP address can be determined using the command line tool ipconfig

 dargah khwaja sahab ajmer main pratidin jo raushnee kii dua padhi jaati he vah dua khwaja hossain ajmeri dwaara likhi gai thi
 Khwaja Hussain Ajmeri is the son of poor Nawaz Rahmatullah Alaih
 aapke walid ke visaal ke baad ajmer shareef ke logon ne yah tay kiya ki unke tino bhaaiyon ko roza-e-khwaja pe le chalate hai, jiske haath lagane se darwaja roza shareef khud ba khud khul jayega usee ko dargah shareef kaa sajjadanshin ghoshit kar diya jayega
 So Rosa Sharif's door did not open from the hands of your two brothers
 aapke haath lagaate hi roza shareef kaa daravaaza khul gaya, chunaanche aapaki masande sajaadagi par baitha diya gaya
 Abul Fazl and Faizi, who belonged to Nagaur Sharif, were very fast and willing, among Akbar's special people
 akbar badshaah se qurbat hasil karne ke liye din darog goi se kaam liya
 Hazrat Khwaja Hussain Ajmeri was described by Abul Fazl as his Khalazad brother
 akbar ko khwaja buzurg se kaaphi aqidat thi
 Akbar was very zealous and clever
 ek din ajmer pahunchakar akbar ne khwaja hossain ajmeri se maaloom kar liya kii kya abul fazal aapke kaalaazaad bhai hai
 Khwaja Hussain has made all Muslim brothers
 akbar ne duusari baar sawaal doharaaya
 You have again all Muslim brothers
 akbar khamosh ho gaya
 Hearing this question, Abul Fazl's goddess Goi came to the fore
 usee din se abul fazal ke dil main aapke liye dushmani paidaa ho gai
 One day, after getting a chance, Akbar wanted to protest against Khwaja Hussain Ajmeri
 akbar se kaha huzur khwaja hossain ajmeri kaa iraadaa he ki raajaaon kaa lashkar jamaa karke aap par chadhaai karen or khud dehali ke badshaah ban jaaen
 Hearing this, Akbar told Abul Fazl that he was sure? Abul Fazl said on this, all the kings are present to salute them, if you want to know the truth then as a test you should tell one of the raja that i want the head of Khwaja Hussain Ajmeri, be brought down
 chunaanche akbar ne raja bikaner, raja jaipur, raja jodhpur, ko apane darbar main talab kiya or hukum diya ki mujhe khwaja hossain ajmeri kaa sar chahie
 The three kings began to make a mess, we can get our father's head cut off, if it is ordered, but a dervish Sifat Bhagat man who is destroying the bellows of all Hindu Muslims, it is impossible for us to cut the head of Khwaja Hussain Ajmeri
 is
 or jo kuch hukum kijiye ham tamile hukum ke liye hajir hai
 When Rajaghan was disgusted with the court, Abul Fazl said, "hazur, i had told you the truth, now you must have been quite sure
" jilaluddin akbar ne foran hukum diya ki khwaja hossain ajmeri se kah do ki wo ajmer se foran nikal jaaen, makka muazzama yaa madina shareef chale jaaen
 Since Khwaja Hussain Ajmeri Saheb was an infamous man, a few left for Mecca Sharif with Khadim
 kaaphi din vahaan qayaam rahaa
 One day, a Khadim, the Hazur emperor of Arz has persecuted you Bilakussur, punish something
 kaadim ke baar baar israar par ek din jalaal main aakaar faramaaya insha allaah wo khud mafinama ke saath hamen ajmer bulaaegaa
 So, on the very second day of this Irshad, there was a severe pain in his stomach, all the blessings came, he was suffering all day
 kisi bhi dawa se ifaaqa na hua
 Hazrat Khwaja Sahab gave a talk when the night was going on, and made a statement in the dream, Akbar has blamed our Farzand Khwaja Hussain, he was innocent, he was called back soon or there is nothing short of your death
 yah sun kar akbar laraz gaya or maafi maangi
 At the same time got up and wrote the order, then Akbar got relief from the pain
 khwaja hossain ajmeri makka muazzama se waapas ajmer shareef aakaar masande sajaadagi par ronaq afaroz hue

 agar kisi ke paas koi adhikaar he, to vah tab tak uskaa upbhog nahin kar saktaa jab tak doosraa ek daayitv ke rup main us adhikaar kaa aadar na kare
 In this sense, rights and obligations are two sides of the same coin
 vyaktigat adhikaron ko tabhi tak jari rakhaa ja saktaa he jab tak rajya kii sanstha unki suraksha karne ke gurutar daayitv kaa paalan karne ke liye taiyaar na ho
 But if it is assumed that only rights will come on the part of the citizens and only obligations on the part of the state, then systematic and decent civil life will become impossible
 isiilie naagarikta kii avadharana main dayitvon or adhikaron ke mishran kii tajaviz kii gayi he
 The most basic of these is the concept of 'political responsibility' which is related to the citizen's acceptance of the authority of the state and the observance of its laws
 araajaktaavaadi chintak vyakti kii swaittata ko kisi bhi tarah ke daayitv ke bandhan main nahin bandhna chaahate, par unhen chhod kar baaki sabhi tarah ke chintakon ne yah samajhane main kaafii dimaag khapaaya he ki kya vyakti ke raajnneetik daayitv hote hai or agar hote hai to unka samuchit aadhaar kya he
 According to some scholars, under the 'social agreement' one should respect the authority of the state on rational and moral grounds
 kuch anya vidwaan isse bhi aage ja kar kehete hai ki daayitv, jimmedaariyaan or karttavya keval kisi anubandh kii dein na ho kar kisi bhi sthir samaaj ke atyantik lakshan hote hai
 Scholars differ greatly on what the extent of political obligations should be
 akhir kis bindu par ek karttavyanishth naagarik rajya ke praadhikaar kaa aadar karne ke daayitv se mukt mahasoos kar saktaa he? kya aisa bhi koi bindu he jab vah sabhi tarah ke raajnneetik dayitvon ko nazarandaaz karke vidroh karne ke adhikaar kaa daawa kar sake? On looking into the history of political theory, the case of Socrates, his teacher and friend, comes out of Plato's pen
 athens ke yuvakon ko bhrasht karne kaa mukadmaa chalane ke baad lagbhag nishchit mrityu-dand kii pratiksha kar rahe sucraat apane puraane dost crito ko bataate hai ki ve karagaar se bhaagane ke liye taiyaar kyon nahin hai
 Socrates argues that he chose to live in Athens and as a citizen enjoyed special facilities available to him
 isi lihaaz se ve athens ke kanoon ke prati nishthavan hone se bhi bandhe hue hai or apane is aashwaasan ko ve apane praanon kii keemat par bhi puraa karnaa chaahate hai
 The case of Socrates states that in order to enjoy the benefits of living in an organized community, political obligations have to be met
 yahan sucraat kii raajnneetik daayitv sambandhi samaj uske bina shart paalan kii he
 That is, Socrates does not investigate the character or nature of the state concerned
 ve yah bhi maan kar chalate hai ki agar koi nivasee rajya se asantusht he to vah apni marzi ke mutabik kisi duusare rajya main rahane ke liye ja saktaa he
 This view of Socrates is problematic in many ways
 masalan, vyaavhaarik rup se yah nagarikon kii ichha par nirbhar nahin hota ki ve kis rajya main rahanaa pasand karte hai
 The first thing is that economic trapping prevents them from leaving their state, and secondly they cannot leave the state even if they do not want it
 duusare, janmana naagarik rajya se aisa koi vaayada nahin karata ki vah amuk dayitvon kaa paalan karegaa
 Yes, such written assurance must be given to the recipient of citizenship
 hobbs or lock jaise chintakon ne apane-apane tareeke se rajya dwaara shashan karne ke adhikaar ko shasiton kii sahmati par aadhaarit bataaya he
 Since a wise person would not want to live in a barbaric state of 'natural state', he voluntarily enters into a contract like social agreement and is prepared to comply with the authority of the state to live under peace
 in donon vidwaanon main hobbs ke mukaable lock kaa vichaar adhik santulit prathit hota he
 According to Hobbes, there is no choice before the person: he must either accept the condition of the totalitarian authority of the state, or else be trapped in a perpetual cut-throat competition of personal interests
 lock raajnneetik daayitv kii avadharana ko ek nahin, balki do samjhauton ke saath jodate hai
 The first contract is the social agreement under which it is mandatory to make mutual agreement to create a society
 iske liye ve apni-apni swatantraaa kaa ek-ek hissaa tak qurbaan karne ke liye taiyaar rahenge taaki ek raajnneetik samudaay kii adheenta main mil sakane vaali sthirataa or suraksha praapt kar saken
 The second contract will be a 'trust' between the society and the government, under which the government will give citizens the confidence to protect their natural rights
 lock kehete hai ki agar rajya nirankush yaa sarvasattavadi ho jaataa he to vyakti ko uske kanoonon ke paalan ke daayitv ko nazarandaaz karke uske kilaaf baghaavat karne kaa adhikaar he
 Here Locke makes it clear that rebellion cannot mean ending the government and returning to the 'natural state', but the establishment of a better government
 saamaajik samjhaute ke siddhant kii bhinn vyakhya karte hue ruso use apane vikhyath sutrikaran ‘jan-ichha’ ke aaine main dikhaate hai
 If a citizen is a member of a society voluntarily and is also part of the public will propounded by that society, then on the basis of that, he will have to abide by political responsibility
 yahan jan-ichha kaa taatpary he samaaj ke prayek sadsy ke vaastavik hit kaa pratinidhitiv
 It is clear that the establishment of Rousseau takes away the principle of liability away from the urge for consent based governance
 raajnneetik daayitv ke saamaajik samjhaute sambandhi siddhant ke do vikalp bhi sujhaaye gayi hai
 The first option rests on an objective understanding of political responsibility
 iske mutabik naagarik dwaara rajya ke adeshon kaa anupaalan keval usee anupaat main kiya ja saktaa he jis anupaat main rajya use laabh pahunchaa saktaa ho yaa uske prayojan puure kar saktaa ho
 Utilitarianism is one such objective theory according to which citizens should obey the government because it tries to provide 'maximum happiness' to the 'greatest number' of people
 doosraa vikalp yah maan kar chalata he ki vyakti kisi samaaj kaa ‘swaabhaavik’ sadsy hota he, isliye uske raajnneetik dayitvon ko bhi ‘swaabhaavik’ samajha janaa chahie
 This idea is somewhat similar to Socrates' understanding
 anudaaravaadi chintakon ne is vikalp ko khaas taur par pasand kiya he
 According to conservatives, institutions such as family, church and government have been created not on the basis of an individual's desire but on the need to give continuity to society
 ye sansthaayen vyakti ko paalati-posti, shikshit karti or uski shakhsiyat kaa nirmaan karti hai
 Therefore one should feel obligation, duty and responsibilities towards them
 iske liye keval kanoon kaa paalan karnaa or dusron kii swatantraaa kaa aadar karnaa hi kaafii nahin he, balki vyakti ko praadhikaar kaa sammaan karte hue zarurat ke mutabik saarvajanik padon kaa jimmaa bhi uthaanaa chahie
 In this way, orthodox thinkers give the status of a person's political obligations to their parents towards their parents
 samaajwaadiyon or saamaajik-janavaadiyon ne dayitvon ke saamaajik pahalu par jor diya he
 In this sense, they want to impose a greater obligation on the citizen than the liberals
 ve chaahate hai ki vyakti samudaay ke liye to kaam kare hi, un logon ke liye bhi kaam kare jo khud kisi vajah se kaam nahin kar sakate
 Only in the society of empowered and irresponsible people, the conditions of fishery justice will dominate
 samudayavaadee araajaktaavaadi chintakon ko is tarah kii daleel kaafii pasand he
 Prudential, radical anarchists such as Bakunin and Kropatkin reject political authority, but expect that in a healthy society people will be equipped with the features of sociality, mutual support and courteous behavior
 marxvaadiyon ne raajnneetik daayitv kii avadharana ko puri tarah se thukraa diya he, kyonki unki nigaah main rajya kii vyakti ke adhikaron kii suraksha main koi dilchaspee nahin hoti
 It is a tool of class rule

 The Trimbakeshwar Jyotirlinga temple is in the Nashik district of maharashtra-province, where the Godavari river originates from the nearby Brahm Giri mountain

 Inside the temple, there are three small lingas in a small pit, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - are considered to be symbols of these three gods
 shivpurana ke brahmagiri parvat ke upar jane ke liye chaudee-chaudee saat sau seedhiyaan bani hui hai
 After climbing these stairs 'ramkund' and 'lashmankund' meet and upon reaching the summit, there is a vision of Bhagwati Godavari emanating from Gomukh
 tryambakeshwargyortiling main brahma, vishnu or mahesh teenon hi virajit hai yahi is jyotirling kii sabase badi visheshta he
 Of all the other Jyotirlingas, only Lord Shiva is enthroned

 The setting of the temple is amazing

 The devotees get them to fulfill different wishes

 The restoration of this temple started in 1755 and was completed in 1786 after a long time of 31 years
 kaha jaataa he ki is bhavy mandir ke nirmaan main kareeb 16 lakh rupye kharch kiye gaye the, jo us samay kaaphi badi rakam maani jaati thi
 After walking some distance inside the village, the main gate of the temple starts to appear
 tryambakeshwar mandir kii bhavy imaarat sindhu-arya style kaa utkrisht namoona he
 After entering the sanctum sanctorum inside the temple, only the Argha of the Shivalinga is visible, not the linga
 gaur se dekhne par argha ke andar ek-ek inch ke teen ling dikhaai dete hai
 These lingas are considered to be the incarnation of Trideva- brahma-vishnu and Mahesh
 bhor ke samay hone vaali puja ke baad is argha par chaandi kaa panchmukhi mukut chadha diya jaataa he
 The Trimbakeshwar temple and village is located in the foothills of a hill called Brahmagiri
 is giri ko shiv kaa saakshaat rup mana jaataa he
 It is on this mountain that the holy Godavari river originates
 kaha jaataa he- In ancient times, Trimbak was the taphobhoomi of Gautama Rishi
 apane upar lage gohatya ke paap se mukti paane ke liye gautam rishi ne kathor tap kar shiv se ganga ko yahan avatarit karne kaa vardaan maanga
 As a result, the Ganges, the Godavari River, originated in the south
 godavari ke udgam ke saath hi gautam rishi ke anunay-vinay ke uparaant shivaji ne is mandir main virajman hona sweekaar kar liya
 This place came to be called Trimbak due to the three-eyed Shivshambhu sitting here
 ujjain or omkareshwar kii hi tarah tryambakeshwar maharaj ko is gaanv kaa raja mana jaataa he, isliye har somvaar ko tryambakeshwar ke raja apni praja kaa haal jaanane ke liye nagar bhraman ke liye nikalate hai
 This story is described in Shivpuran about the establishment of this Jyotirlinga
 ek baar maharishi gautam ke tapovana main rahane vaale brahmanon kii patniyaan kisi baat par unki patni ahilya se naaraaz ho gayi
 He inspired his husbands to do sage Gautama
 un brahmanon ne iske nimitt bhagavan shriganeshji kii aradhana kii
 Pleased with his worship, Ganesha appeared and asked him to ask for the groom, those Brahmins said - 'prabhu! If you are happy with us then somehow get Rishi Gautama out of this ashram
 ' unki yah baat sunakar ganeshji ne unhen aisa var maangane ke liye samajhaayaa
 But he remained firm on his request
 antat ganeshji ko vivash hokar unki baat manani padi
 To keep the mind of his devotees, he took the form of a weak cow and started living in the field of sage Gautama
 gaay ko fasal charate dekhakar rishi badi narmi ke saath haath main trin lekar use haankane ke liye lapke
 As soon as those trunks were touched, that cow fell there itself
 ab to bada haahaakaar machaa
 All the Brahmins gathered and started denouncing the sage Gautama as a cow killer
 rishi gautam is ghatana se bahut aashcharyachakit or duhkhi the
 Now all those Brahmins said that you should leave this ashram and go somewhere else
 go-hatyare ke nikat rahane se hamen bhi paap lagegaa
 Being compelled, the sage Gautama started living with his wife Ahilya a curse away from there
 kintu un brahmanon ne vahaan bhi unka rahanaa dubhar kar diya
 They started saying - 'now you have no right to do the work of Vedas and Yajnadi due to cow slaughter
 ' atyant anunay bhav se rishi gautam ne un brahmanon se prarthana kii ki aap log mere praayshchit or uddhaar kaa koi upaay bataaen
 Then he said- 'gautam! You can revolve the whole earth thrice by telling your sins everywhere to everyone
 phir lautakar yahan ek maheene tak vrath karo
 After this, after doing 101 circumambulation of 'brahmagiri' you will be purified or bring Gangaji here and bathe with water and worship Shiva with one crore earthly Shivalingas
 iske baad punah gangaji main snaan karke is brahmagiri kii 11 baar parikrama karo
 Then bathing the earthly Shivalingas with the holy water of hundred pots will save you
 brahmanon ke kathananusaar maharishi gautam ve saare kaary puure karke patni ke saath purnatah tallin hokar bhagwaan shiv kii aradhana karne lage
 Pleased with this, Lord Shiva appeared and asked him to ask for the groom
 maharishi gautam ne unase kaha- 'bhagavan main yahi chahta hoon ki aap mujhe go-hatya ke paap se mukt kar den
 'lord Shiva said-' Gautam! You are completely sinless
 go-hatya kaa aparaadh tum par chal purvak lagaaya gaya tha
 i want to punish the Brahmins of your ashram who have done this deceitfully
 ' On this Maharishi Gautam said that Lord! i have received your darshan for his sake only
 ab unhen meraa paramahit samajhakar un par aap krodh na karen
 Many sages, sages and devas gathered there, approving Gautam's talk and prayed to Lord Shiva to stay there forever
 ve unki baat maanakar vahaan tryambak jyotirling ke naam se sthit ho gaye
 Gangaji brought by Gautam ji also started to flow near there under the name Godavari
 yah jyotirling samast punyon ko pradaan karne vaala he
 During this trip, the panchmukhi gold mask of Trimbakeshwar Maharaj is seated in a palanquin and rotated in the village
 phir kushavart tirth sthit ghat par snaan karaayaa jaataa he
 The mask is then brought back to the temple and a diamond crown is worn
 yah puraa drishy tryambak maharaj ke rajbhishek-sa mahasoos hota he
 It is a supernatural experience to see this journey
 ‘kushavart tirth kii janmakatha kaaphi rochak he
 It is said that Godavari river used to disappear from Brahmagiri mountain again and again
 godavari ke palaayan ko rokane ke liye gautam rishi ne ek kusha kii madad lekar godavari ko bandhan main band diya
 Since then there is always plenty of water in this pool
 is kunda ko hi kushavart tirth ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 At the time of Kumbh bath, Shaiva Akhara takes royal bath in this pool
 ’- danta katha Devotees throng to the Trimbakeshwar temple on the day of Shivaratri and Sawan Monday
 bhakt bhor ke samay snaan karke apane aradhy ke darshan karte hai
 There is also a special puja called Kalasarpa Yoga and Narayana Nagabali, due to which people keep coming here throughout the year

 Later, this form was extended by the Siddhpant, Shaivapanth, Nathpanth Vaishnav and Shakta Panthis in their own way

 What is that yoga? Yoga is an antidote to the mindset, that duty permeates the karmatra

 rajasekhar dwaara ullikhit "sahitya vidya" namakaran kavy kii bhartiya kalpana ke upar ashrith he, parantu ye namakaran prasiddh nahin ho sake
 The use of the word ornament in "ornamentation" should be understood in both a broad and narrow sense
 alankaar ke do arth maanya hai - On accepting the wider meaning, the ornamentation is a vizhastra of all the elements of Kavashobha - qualities, rituals, rasa, vritti sound etc
 - in which a detailed description of the nature and importance of these elements is presented
 sankeern arth main grahan karne par yah naam apane aitihaasik mahatv ko abhivyakt karata he
 In the early era of literature, "ornamentation" was considered to be the supreme being of poetry, in the absence of which poetry is lifeless and lifeless like heatless fire
 "alankaar" ke gambhir vishleshan se ek ore "vakrokti" kaa tatv udbhoot hua or duusari ore arth kii samiksha karne par "dhwani" ke siddhant kaa spasht sanket mila
 Therefore, despite being an exponent of poetic elements like rasa, sound, quality, etc
, due to the ornamental predominance, criticism was named "ornamentation" and became popular
 alankaaron kii, visheshat: upama, roopak, swaabhaavokti tathaa atishyokti kii, uplabdhi rugveda ke mantron main nishchit rup se hoti he, parantu vaidic yug main is shaastra ke aavirbhaav kaa pramaan nahin miltaa
 Literary analysis of "upma" from Nirukta's practice appears to be the culmination of criticism from Yasak from the earlier era
 yask ne kisi pracheen acharya ke upmalakshan kaa nirdesh hi nahin kiya he, pratyut karmopama, bhutopama, roopopama, siddhopama, arthopama jaise moulik upama-prakaaron kaa bhi drushtaantpur:sar varnan kiya he 
 It is clear from this that the rise of the ornament had preceded Yask
 kaashyap tathaa vararuchi, brahmadatt tathaa nandiswami ke naam tarunvachaspati ne aadya alankarikon main avashya liye hai parantu inke granth or mat kaa parichay nahin miltaa
 Only the "natyashastra" of Bharata is available nowadays among the Ashtadash Acharyas of Jupiter, Upamanyu, Suvarnabha, Prachatayana, Shesha, Pulastya, Parashar, Utthya etc
 referred to in "kavmimamsa" by Rajasekhar
 anya acharya keval kaalpanik satta dhaaran karte hai
 This much is certain that the rise of Greek criticism centuries before "ornamentation" had become recognized as authentic scripture
