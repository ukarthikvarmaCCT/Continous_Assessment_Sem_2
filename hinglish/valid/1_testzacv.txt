 In a remote village in France, Balian, a blacksmith, was suffering from the recent suicide of his wife
 dharmayoddhaon kaa ek samooh chote se gaanv main aata he or unamem se ek ne swayan ko baalion kaa pita, ibelin kaa baron godfre, ke rup main parichay dekar baalion se sampark kiya
 Godfrey asks Balian to return to Jerusalem with him
 baalion ne manaa kar detaa he or dharmayoddha laut jate hai
 Later, Balian's half-brother, the priest of the city, told that he had ordered the head of Balian's wife to be cut off before burial
 tab baalion ne janaa ki uskaa bhai usee cross ko pehla he jo uski patni dafan kiye jane ke pehle pahani thi
 Balian killed his brother in anger, retrieved the cross and fled the village
 baalion ne jerushlem ke shahar main apane or apni patni ke kshamaprarthana or paapon se mochan ke liye apane pita kaa pataa lagaaya
 After meeting his father, soldiers led by Godfrey's nephew, naturally, arrest Balian
 In reality, the nephew's desire was to kill both Balian and Godfrey so that his father, and indeed he, could attain the rank of Baron of Godfrey
 godfrey ne baalion ko saunpane se inkaar kar diya or tab bhattije ne waapas hon kaa naatak kiya or turant godfrey or uske aadamiyo ke khilaaf chupake se akraman kar diya
 Later all the nephew fighting men were killed and two of Godfrey's men were killed

 On Balian's journey to Jerusalem, his ship overturns and is trapped in a storm in which Balian and his horse survive
 jab baalion ne ghode ko dhvanshavshesh se mukt hi kiya tha ki vah ghabrahat main bhaag jaataa he
 Upon discovering the horse in the desert, Balian encounters a Muslim horseman and his servant
 ghode ke adhikaar par ek ladaai hui or baalion ne akraman karne par ghudsavaar ko anichhaa se maar daalaa lekin naukar ko chhod diya or usase jerushlem kaa maargdarshan karne ko kaha

 aadmi ne bataaya ki uskaa maaraa gaya maalik sarasans ke bich mahatvapurn nite tha or uske krity use unase sammaan or prasiddhi dilaayenge
 After he was accepted as the new owner of Ibelin by Godfrey's followers, Balian soon became acquainted with the main players of Jerusalem's political landscape: Tiberius, the leper king Baldwin IV, the head of Jerusalem, Princess Sibylla, the king's sister, and her Husband Gu de Lucignan, who supported anti-muslim activities of the dastardly group similar to the Emperor Templar

 However, critics such as Roger Ebert found that the film's message is deeper than Scott's earlier film "gladiator"

 One critic believes that Balian was "a more brave and principled thinker-warrior" than a massively strong commander, and that Balian used more brains than body to gain advantage in battle
 " Bloom took 20 pounds for acting, and the director of "kingdom of Heaven" described many complex aspects of Bloom's acting with many unknown connections
 Despite criticism, Bloom won two awards for his performance

 Riley Smith further commented that "such idiocy will advance existing myths", arguing that the film is now based on the romanticized views of Sir Walter Scott's book, The Talisma, published in 1825 rejected by academics " Fellow Crusade historian Jonathan Phillips also spoke out against the film

 There were three major revolutions in the world in the 18th century
 ye bhinn-bhinn deshon main avashya hui kintu inke parinaam evam prabhaav vishwa par doorgaami hue
 The first of these revolutions is the grand revolution that occurred in England
 ise 'gauravshaalee kranti' athwa 'raktahin kranti' bhi kaha jaataa he kyonki is kranti main kisi bhi paksh ke vyakti ke rakt kii ek boond bhi nahin nikali or keval pradarshan evam vaartalap se hi kranti safal ho gai
 This bloodless revolution which took place in England in 1688 AD raised the demand for independence in America too
 america main shashan british sansad dwaara chalaaya jaataa tha jo americavsiyon ko sahan na tha
 They wanted to govern independently
 atah america upnivesh ne apni swatantraaa ke liye jo sangharsh kiya vahi america kranti kehalaata he
 This revolution took place in 1776 AD

 se hi france main aatank kaa vaataavaran prarambh ho gaya tha
 Thereafter, dissenters in France started coming to England to escape the suppression of terror
 isse igland main asantosh failaa
 James also held Catholic abilities in university and government jobs
 james ke anya anuchit or avaidh kaaryon se england main teevr rosh or virodh fail gaya
 In the end James II had to leave England and Parliament invited his daughter Mary and her husband William to England and made Mary the ruler of England
 is ghatana ko england main mahaan kranti yaa vaibhavpurn kranti kehete hai
 In this revolution, not even a drop of blood was written and changes were made
 isse is kranti ko gauravshaalee kranti bhi kehete hai
 The glorious revolution of England is known as the bloodless revolution
 1688 een kii mahan angreji kranti shantipurvak sampann ho gai thi
 The king of England changed, the governance of England changed, but there was not a single drop of blood

 As a result of this meeting, an organization called "labor Representation Committee" came into existence
 1969 main england kii sansad ne ''adhikaar kaa adhinium'' ko paarit kiya
 With this, the supremacy of Parliament was established in England
 
 
 is prakaar 1688 i
 main england main shaskaon kaa parivartan bina rakt kii boond bahaae sampann ho gaya, isliye is ghatana ko vaibhavpurn mahaan shandaar kranti kehete hai
 The significance of this bloodless state revolution lies not in its thunder-bells, but in the prudence of its objectives and the far reaching of achievements
 yah ek yug nirmaankari ghatana he
 This started the era of popular government in England and the ruling came out of the hands of autocratic autocratic kings and came into the hands of Parliament
 iske parinaam adholikhit hue- This revolution brought an end to the long-standing conflict between the Stuart kings and Parliament
 is sangharsh main sansad kii vijay hui
 Now the actual ruling parliament in England became
 samprabhutaa sansad main nihit - kranti ke samay sansad ne ‘‘bill of ritis’’ paarit kar us par wiliam or meri kii sweekruti le lee
 With this the sovereignty of the Parliament was accepted and the supreme power of the king was abolished
 janata kii satt sarvopari maan lee gayi
 Sovereignty was accomplished in the king's theory, but in practice Parliament became paramount
 daivi siddhanton amaanya or sansad ke vyapak adhikaar - is kranti ne raja ke daivi adhikaron ko amaanya kar diya
 The king's authority to repeal any law passed by the Parliament was over
 raja, sansad kii sweekruti ke bina koi kar nahin laga saktaa
 This revolution made it clear that protecting civil liberties, enacting laws and levying taxes were within the purview of Parliament
 raja sansad ke adhikaron main kisi bhi prakaar se hastkshep nahin kar saktaa tha
 Establishment of constitutional monarchy - Before the revolution, the king was paramount, but after this the king remained a normal person under the Act of Parliament
 ab raja kii swechhacharita samaapt ho gayi
 His powers were restricted and controlled by Parliament
 ab england main vaidhanik rajtantr kaa yug prarambh hua or sansadeey pranali kaa shashan prarambh hua
 Parliament's authority over the army - Until now the army and its authority were under the king
 ab sansad ne vidroh adhinium paarit kar sena par purna niyantran sthapit kar liya
 This ended the military power of the king and also the chaos in the army
 catholic khatre kaa ant or england kaa dharm anglican - bill of ritis main yah tathy spasht kar diya gaya ki koi catholic raja yaa vah vyakti jiskaa vivaah catholic se hua ho england ke raaj singhaasana par asin nahin ho sakegaa
 In this way, England became free from the danger of Catholics forever
 dharmik kshetra main bhi yah spasht kar diya gaya ki anglican dharm england kaa vaastavik dharm he
 The king's authority over the church was abolished
 dharm ke maamalon main bhi sansad kaa uttaradayitv ho gaya
 This eventually created an atmosphere of religious tolerance in England
 sansad dwaara grih or videsh-niti kaa nirdhaaran : ab tak raja desh kii grih or videsh nitiyon kaa swayan sanchaalan karata tha
 He was inspired by his personal interests
 desh ke hiton kii upeksha kii jaati thi
 Due to this, the foreign policy adopted by the king at many times remained fruitless
 kintu kranti ke baad grih or videsh niti kaa nirdhaaran sansad ke paramashar or sweekruti se kiya jane laga
 This increased England's international prestige and expanded its colonial empire
 europe kii raajnneeti par prabhaav - england kii is shandaar kranti kaa prabhaav europe ke deshon par padaa
 Till now, autocratic arbitrary rajasatta was considered as ideal royalty in Europe

 The term stylology is made up of two words - style and science which literally means 'science of style', that is, science in which style is studied scientifically and systematically
 ’style’ shabd angreji ke style shabd kaa hindi roopaantar he
 Similarly 'stylology' is the stylistics of English
 shailivigyaan bhashavigyaan evam sahityashastra donon kii sahaayta letaa hua bhi donon se alag swatantra vigyaan he
 On the one hand stylology studies linguistics on the basis of the principles of literature, which includes rasa, ornamentation, curvature, sound, manner, instinct, tendency, word-power, virtues, defects, images, symbols etc
 duusari ore shailivigyaan ke antargat bhashaa-style kaa adhyayan bhashavigyaan ke siddhanton ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he, jisamen bhashaa kii prakruti or sanrachana ke anushilan ko mahatva diya jaataa he
 There are mainly two directions for the study of stylistics: sahityashastra ke aadhaar par kisi kavi, lekhak, kriti kaa stylivaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa he arthath ras, alankaar, vakrokti, reeti, dhwani, gun, dosha, vritti, pravriti, bimb, chand aadi ke aadhaar par dekha jaataa he ki lekhak yaa kavi ne sahityashastra ke siddhanton kaa anusaran uchit rup main kahan tak kiya he evam kriti yaa rachana kii style main sahityashastra ke niyamon kaa paalan vyavasthit dhang se kahan tak hua he
 This type of study will be considered as the object of the field of literature
 bhashavigyaan ke aadhaar par kisi kavi yaa lekhak kii rachana main prayukt bhashaa kii prakruti or sanrachana ke tattvon kaa vaigyanik vishleshan karte hai
 Five elements of language are considered on the basis of nature and structure - sound, word, form, sentence and meaning
 iske aadhaar par dekha jaataa he ki kavi kii bhashaa main kahan dhwani-vichlan, dhwani-chayan, dhwani-samaanaantar kaa prayog hua, kahan shabd-vichlan, shabd -chayan, shabd-samaanaantar kiya gaya
 Similarly, study is also done at the form-level, sentence-level and meaning-level
 vaakyon ke antargat muhaavarey evam lokoktiyon ke vichlan aadi kaa adhyayan bhi kiya jaataa he
 Thus on the basis of linguistics, the language of the writer is analyzed with great depth
 bharat main shailivigyaan kaa adhyayan aadhunik yug kii dein he
 There have been many important works on stylistics in Western literature
 saath hi anekanek granth bhi prakashit hue hai, in grantho main shailivigyaan ke swaroop ko atyant vistaarpurvak samajhane kaa prayaas kiya he
 Indian scholars are trying to understand and explain the form of stylistics by following these texts
 yahi kaaran he ki kuch vidwaan shailivigyaan ko bhashavigyaan se jodate hai, kuch sahitya shaastra se tathaa kuch bhashavigyaan tathaa sahityashastra dono se
 Some scholars accept it as an independent subject and some consider it part of experimental linguistics
 jaise bhashavigyaan ke do rup hai- saidhantik bhashavigyaan evam praayogic bhashavigyaan; usee prakaar shailivigyaan ke bhi do rup hai - saidhantik shailivigyaan evam prayogic shailivigyaan
 Theoretical stylology is the scientific interpretation of the principles of style, and in experimental stylology, a book or author's style is classified, analyzed, and analyzed on the basis of theory

 As a royal dynasty, Rahim was given the title of 'mirza Khan'
 rahim ne baba jambur kii dekh-rekh main gahan adhyayan kiya
 At the end of education, Akbar got Rahim married to his daughter's daughter Mahabano
 iske baad rahim ne gujarat, kumbhalaner, udaipur aadi yudhon main vijay praapt kii
 On this, Akbar honored Rahim with the highest title of his time, 'mirarj'

 Rahim died in 1627 at the age of 71

 Humayun chose Bairam Khan for the education of Crown Prince Akbar and appointed Akbar's guardian in the last days of his life, giving him the responsibility of managing the state
 bairam khan ne kushal niti se akbar ke rajya ko majboot banane main puraa sahyog diya
 For some reason there was a difference of opinion between Bairam Khan and Akbar
 akbar ne bairam khan ke vidroh ko safaltaapurvak dabaa diya or apane ustad kii maan evam laaj rakhte hue use haj par jane kii ichha jataai
 As a result, Bairam Khan left for Haj

 At such a time, Akbar, giving proof of his greatness, gave shelter to him with great generosity and said to Rahim, "keep it happy in all ways
" ise yah pataa na chale ki inke pita khan khaanaan kaa saaya sar se uth gaya he
 Baba said to Jambur that this is our son
 ise hamaari drushti ke saamne rakhaa karo
 In this way, Akbar raised Rahim just like a son of religion
 kuch dinon ke pashchaat akbar ne vidhwaa sultanaa begum se vivaah kar liya
 Akbar honored Rahim with the title of "mirza Khan" as per the royal family
 rahim kii shiksha- diksha akbar kii udaar dharm- nirpeksh niti ke anukool hui
 Due to this education, the poetry of Rahim remains a thunderous neck of the Hindus even today
 dinakar ji ke kathananusaar akbar ne apane deen-ilaahi main hindootv ko jo sthaan diya hoga, usase kai guna zyada sthaan rahim ne apni kavitaaon main diya
 It is said about Rahim that he was a Muslim by religion and a pure Indian by culture

 In this marriage too, Akbar did the same, which had been doing before that due to the relationship of marriage, mutual tension and old bitterness was ended
 rahim ke vivaah se bairam khan or mirza ke bich chali aa rahi puraani ranjish khatm ho gayi
 Rahim was married at the age of about sixteen
