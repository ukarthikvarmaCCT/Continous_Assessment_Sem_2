 Therefore, the claimant to the Prime Minister must have all the qualifications to be an MP
 bhartiya samvidhan ke pancham bhaag kaa 84vaan anuchhed, ek saansad kii arhataaon ko nirdisht karata he, uske anusaar: a person shall be qualified to be elected to fill a place in Parliament only when— jaisaa ki tisare bindu main vinirdisht he, paatr ko sansad dwaara bhavishya main paarit paatrata ke kisi bhi yogayata par khara utaarna hoga tathaa kyonki pradhanmantri kaa saansad hona anivaary he, atah pradhanmantritv ke paatr ko loksabhaa yaa rajyasabha kaa sadsy hone yogya hone hetu, kuch anya arhataaon par bhi khara utarana hota he, jinamein uskaa vikrut charitra vaala vyakti yaa diwalia ghoshit naa hona, swechha se kisi videshi rajya kii naagarikta praapt kar lenaa, kisi nyaayalay dwaara uskaa nirvachan shunya ghoshit kar diya janaa, tathaa raashtrapati yaa rajyapal niyukt hona shaamil hai
 Also, an eligible person should not be an employee of any beneficial post in the service of any office and administrative or non-administrative body under the Central Government, any State Government or any of the aforesaid Government
 saath hi sadan se prastaav-sweekrut nishkasana se bhi paatr kii sadsyta samaapt ho jaati he
 After the appointment, the Prime Minister's disqualification, on any of the foregoing qualifications, is proved in a legal court, then the election of that person is declared void, and he is expelled from the post of Prime Minister
 
 pradhanmantri ko pad kii shapath raashtrapati dwaara dilaai jaati he
 For appointment to the post, the prospective officer is required to take two oaths
 ye donon shapath bhartiya samvidhan kii teesri anusuchee main vinirdisht hai, 99, 124, 148, 164, 188 or 219): Types of Pledge or Affirmation: 1 mantripad kii shapath kaa praaroop : 2 Form of Oath of Privacy: saiddhanthik rupatah, padasth pradhanmantri, "raashtrapati ke prasadparyant", apane pad par bana rahata he
 Unlike the President, no time limit has been set for the Prime Minister's term
 atah ek padasth pradhanmantri anishchit kaal tak pradhanmantripad par bana rah saktaa he, basharte ki raashtrapati ko usapar "vishwaas" ho
 The real meaning of this is that a person can hold the post of Prime Minister only as long as the majority in the Lok Sabha is in his favor
 baharhaal, loksabhaa kaa puraa kaarykaal 5 varsh hota he, jiske baad nae chunaav karaaye jate hai, or naveen sabha punah pradhanmantri ke paksh main vishwasamat paarit karti he, yadi nav-nirvaachit sabha pradhanmantri main avishvaas ghoshit kar detii he to phir pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal samaapt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, it can be said that the Prime Minister has a full term of 5 years, after which he is reviewed again
 baharhaal, pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal 5 varshon se purv hi samaapt ho saktaa he, yadi kisi karanvash, loksabhaa sarkaar ke virodh main avishvaas mat paarit kare athwa yadi kisi karanvash, pradhanmantri kii sansad kii sadsyta shunaya ghoshit ho jaae to pradhanmantri, kisi bhi samay, apane pad kaa tyaag, raashtrapati ko ek likhit tyaagptr saunp ke kar sakate hai
 Prime Minister Morarji Desai was the first Prime Minister of the country to relinquish his office during his tenure
 pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal par naa hi kisi prakaar kii samay-seemaa he naa koi aayu seemaa nirdisht kii gai he
 India Gateway bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 74 main spasht rup se mantriparishad kii adhyakshata tathaa sanchaalan hetu pradhanmantri kii upasthiti aavashyak maanata he
 In the event of his death or resignation, the entire council has to step down
 vah akele hi mantri parishad kaa gathan karata he
 The President appoints the Minister on his advice only
 mantri gana ke vibhaag kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 The function of the cabinet also does the same
 desh ke prashasan ko nirdesh bhi vahi detaa he
 All policy decisions are taken by him
 raashtrapati tathaa mantri parishad ke madhyasampark sutara bhi vahi he
 He is also the principal spokesman of the Council of Ministers
 vah parishad ke naam se ladi jane vaali sansadeey bahason kaa netritv karata he
 He can participate in any debate being fought in favor of the Council in Parliament
 mantri gana ke madhya samanvay bhi vahi karata he
 He can ask for any information from any ministry
 in sab karnow ke chalate pradhanmantri ko bharat kaa sabase mahatvapurn rajnatik vyaktitv mana jaataa he
 The most important reason for the dominance and importance of the Indian Prime Minister is the executive powers conferred on his office bearers
 samvidhan kaa anuchhed 74 pradhanmantri ke pad ko sthapit karata he, evam yah nirdisht karata he ki ek mantriparishad hogi jiskaa mukhiya pradhanmantri hoga, jo bharat ke raashtrapati ko "salaah or sahaayta" pradaan karenge
 And Article 75 establishes that the appointment of ministers will be done by the President as per the advice of the Prime Minister, and the minister will also be given various assignments as per the advice of the President, Prime Minister
 atah samvidhan yah nirdisht karata he kii, jahaan sanvaidhanik kaaryakari adhikaar bharat ke raashtrapati ke paas he, parantu kyonki in sambandhon main bharat ke raashtrapati keval pradhanmantri kii salaahnusaar kaary karte hai, atah vaastavik rup se, in kaaryakari adhikaron kaa prayog pradhanmantri apni icchaanusaar karte hai
 The constitution establishes by these legislations that as the head of the nation of India, the Prime Minister shall exercise all the executive powers vested indirectly, and will be the head of the entire Council of Ministers and constitution of the Council of Ministers by Article 75, appointment of ministers
 And his assignment has also been left to the will of the Prime Minister, but also the ministers and ministers
 The Constitution, the Prime Minister in relation to schools provides complete freedom
 pradhanmantri, apane mantrimandal main kisi bhi vyakti ko shaamil kar sakate he, nikaal sakate he, niyukt kar sakate hai yaa nilambit karvaa sakate hai
 Since ministers are appointed by the President only on the advice of the Prime Minister, it means that the Council of Ministers is actually created by people of the Prime Minister's choice, in which they can change at any time of their choice
 saath hi mantriyon ko vibhinn kaarybhaar pradaan karnaa bhi purnatah pradhanmantri kii ichha par nirbhar karata he; ve apane mantriyon main se kisi ko bhi koi bhi mantralay yaa kaarybhaar saunp sakati hai, chin sakate hai yaa doosraa koi kaarybhaar / mantralay saunp sakate hai
 In these cases there is no constitutional obligation of any kind to the Prime Minister to consult the ministers concerned, or to obtain their permission
 balki mantriyon va mantralayon ke vishay main purvakthith kisi bhi maamle main sambandhit mantri yaa mantriyon kii salaah yaa anumati praapt karne kii, pradhanmantri par kisi bhi prakaar kii sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he
 They can also ask any minister to resign from the minister any time they want, and if that minister refuses to resign, they can ask the president to suspend him from office
 mantriyon kii niyukti evam mantralayon ke aavnton ke alaava, mantrimandaleey sabhaayen, cabinet kii gatividhiyaan or sarkaar kii nitiyon par bhi pradhanmantri kaa puraa niyantran hota he
 The Prime Minister is the constitutional head and leader of the Council of Ministers
 ve sansad evam anya manchon par mantriparishad kaa pratinidhitiv karte he
 They preside over cabinet meetings, and decide the agenda of these meetings, and other topics of discussion
 balki cabinet baithkon main uthne vaale saare maamle va vishaysoochee, pradhanmantri kii hi sweekruti va sahmati se nirdhaarit kiye jate hai
 It is at the will of the Prime Minister to approve or reject various proposals that arise in cabinet meetings
 haalaanki, charchaa karne or apane nijee suzav va prastaavon ko baithak ke samaksh rakhane kii swatantraaa har mantri ko he, parantu antytah vahi prastaav yaa nirnay liya jaataa he, jisapar pradhanmantri kii sahmati ho or nirnay paarit kiye jane ke pashchaat use puure mantriparishad kaa antim nirnay mana jaataa he, or sabhi mantriyon ko pradhanmantri ke us nirnay ke saath chalanaa hota he
 Therefore, it can be said that as a constitutionally, the Prime Minister has complete control and unchallenged dominance over the Union Cabinet
 niyantran ke maamle main pradhanmantri, mantriparishad kaa sarvesarva hota he, or uske istife se puri sarkaar gir jaati he, arthath saare mantriyon kaa mantritv samaapt ho jaataa he
 Apart from the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers, the Constitution vests another special privilege on the Prime Minister, this privilege being the mid-contact thread between the Council of Ministers and the President
 yah visheshadhikaar keval pradhanmantri ko diya gaya he, jiske madhyam se pradhanmantri samay-samay par, raashtrapati ko mantrisabha main liye jane vaale nirnay or charchaaon se sambandhit jaankaree se raashtrapati ko adhishuchet karaate rahete hai
 No minister other than the Prime Minister can voluntarily reveal to the President any of the subjects discussed in the Council
 yah visheshadhikaar kii mahatv va arth yah he kii mantrimandaleey sabhaaon main charchit vishyon main se kin jaankariyon ko gopneey rakhana he, evam kin jaankariyon ko duniya ke saamne prastut karnaa he, yah tay karne kaa adhikaar bhi pradhanmantri ke paas he
 The Prime Minister works as the Chief Manager of the various organs of the state, whose job is to get all the departments and organs of the state to do the work as they wish
 sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon or mantralayon ke bich samanvay bananaa, or cabinet dwaara liye gaye nirnyon ko karyanvit karwaanaa tathaa vibhinn vibhaagon ko nirdeshit karnaa bhi unka kaam he
 It is also their job to resolve administrative differences between ministries and departments and take final decisions
 sarkari kaaryon ke karyanvayan ke alaava bhi, sarkari tantra par pradhanmantri kaa atyadhik prabhaav or pakad hota he
 Being the head of government and government, all the executive appointments are actually made by the Prime Minister
 saare ucchstareey adhikari va padaadhikari pradhanmantri, apane pasand ke hi niyukt karte hai
 These appointments include high-advisors and high officials of government ministries and offices, governors of various states, attorney generals, auditors, overlords of public service commissions, and other members, ambassadors of various countries, consulars, etc
 yah saare ucchstareey niyuktiyaan, bharat ke raashtrapati dwaara, pradhanmantri kii salaah par kiye jate hai

 At the same time it is expected that the Prime Minister will make important bills and announcements taken by the government in the House and the Prime Minister will answer from the ruling side about those important decisions
 loksabhaa adhyaksh kaa chunaav, nirvachan dwaara hota he, atah saadharantah, sabhapati bhi bahumat daal kaa hota he
 Therefore, being the leader of the majority of pulses, through the Speaker, the Prime Minister also has the ability to influence the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in a limited way, as the Chairman is the Speaker of the House, and the Chairman also determines the table of contents in the House
 However, the action of the House cannot be affected to a greater extent
 in kartavyon ke alaava, sansadeey karrwai ko par pradhanmantri kaa sabase mahatvapurn shakti he, loksabhaa satr bulaane or satrant karne kii shakti
 Article 85 of the constitution gives the President of India the right to call and end the session of the Lok Sabha, but in this case the President has to act according to the advice of the Prime Minister
 arthath vaastavikrupe, loksabhaa kaa satr bulaanaa or ant karnaa pradhanmantri ke haathon main hota he
 This right is, undoubtedly, the most important right given in the hands of the Prime Minister, which gives him an opportunity to have limited control not only on his party but also on the activities of the opposition mps
 sarkaar or desh ke netaa hone ke naate, vaishvik manch par bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa pradhanmantri kii sabase mahatvapurn zimmedaariyon main se ek he
 The Prime Minister has the most important role in determining the global policy of the Indian state, due to his immense control over the government and the Council of Ministers

 The Ministry of External Affairs of India handles global relations and related matters, for which an independent cabinet minister is also appointed in the name of the foreign minister, but because foreign policies, etc
, the Prime Minister determines, therefore, the Foreign Minister is ultimately decided by the Prime Minister
 Implements the decisions and policies taken
 vibhinn deshon se samrik, aarthik, kootnithik, vanijyik or sansadhanik, ityadi sandhiyaan or samjhaute, tathaa unase judi kootnithik bahes or vaartaon main pradhanmantri kaa kirdaar sabase mahatvapurn hota he, or aisi vaartaon main ve desh kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 It is also the responsibility of the Prime Minister to welcome and host the Heads of State and Delegations of various countries

 He represents India in international organizations such as United Nations, G20, BRICS, SAARC, non-aligned Movement, Commonwealth, etc
, and stands for India
 antarrashtriya manch par desh kii chhavi banane, or kootnithik vaartaon dwaara desh ke hit kii aapurti karne main pradhanmantri kaa sthaan behad mahatvapurn he
 The Constitution of India, being the head of the national head and all strategic forces, gives the President of India the right to declare war and peace from any other country, but its real authority lies with the Prime Minister, because according to the advice of the Prime Minister in this matter Are bound to work yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke alaava, yuddh kii ranneeti nirdhaarit karnaa tathaa samrik balon ko niyantrit karnaa bhi pradhanmantri dwaara hi hota he tathaa shanti-ghoshnaa karnaa or shanti-samjhauta karnaa bhi pradhanmantri kaa karttavya he

 Apart from humans, the search journey is also done by animals
 mossphate ek electronic yukti he jo vidyut sanketon ko pravardhit karne yaa switch karne ke kaam aati he
 Although it is a four-legged device, gate, drain and body), it is often used only by connecting the b terminal with the source terminal
 atah vyaavhaarik rup se anya field-effect transistoron kii bhaanti yah bhi teen terminal vaali yukti ban jaati he
 BJT was once the most used device, but now MOSFET has become the most used device in both digital and analog circuits
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki mosphate ke prayog se ekikrut paripathon main saste main bahut adhik 'packing ghanatv' praapt kiya ja rahaa he
 Although doped polysilicon is used instead of 'metal oxide' to isolate the gate nowadays, its old name MOSFET is still unchanged
 mosphate kii dren-sorce dhara ko get or sorce ke bich ke vibhavaantar dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 Since the gate is separated from the remaining parts of the mosphates, very little current is required to drive the gait

 inkaa nijee gurutvkarshan inke dravya ko sanghatit rakhata he
 Scattered like dots of light at night in the cloudless sky, flickering lights show many stars
 kuch chamakate taron ke samooh akaash ko vibhinn bhaagon main baant dete hai
 The group of these stars is called the constellation
 puure akaash ko 89 taramandalon main vibhakt karke un taramandalon ke naam rakh die gaye hai
 The constellations of the zodiac are very famous, their nouns are Aries, Taurus etc
 kisi ek taramandal ke taron ko unke drishy kantimaan ke avaroh kram main chun liya jaataa he
 Asterisks are then named by placing Greek letters next to the constellation's name, such as the brightest star of the Aries zodiac named after the alphabet
 kuch taramandalon main taron kii sankhya itani adhik he ki greek varnmaala ke aksharon kii sankhya unke liye kam pad jaati he
 For naming such strings, we write the former Latin letters of the constellations and numbers if necessary
 kuch taare atiprakashit hone ke kaaran atiprasiddh hai tathaa unke naam taramandalon ke sandarbh ke bina bhi jane ja sakate hen, jaise lubdhak, magha, chitra aadi
 This type of nomenclature helps to identify strings
 khaali aankhon se dekhne par kuch taare adhik chamkile tathaa kuch kam chamkile dikhaai dete hai
 According to their radiance, we classify the stars into several radians
 taare hamase bahut adhik duuri par sthit hai
 We do not see less bright stars as the distance increases
 bina yantra kii sahaayta ke hamaari ankhen chathe kantimaan tak ke taare dekh sakati hai
 The classification of radians is such that the stars appear brightest, their minimums are considered to be the minimum number of stars, less than that of bright stars, and so on
 kantimaan ke taare kii apeksha use purvavarti kantimaan taare kii chamak athwa 2
512 guna adhik hoti he
 In this way, the star of the first radiance is 2
512 times brighter than the star of the second radius and the star of the second radius is 2
512 times brighter than the star of the third radius
 yadi ham chathe kantimaan ke taare kii chamak 1 maan len, to pratham kantimaan se chathe kantimaan tak ke taron kii chamak 100:39
82:15
85:6:31 : 2:51 : 1 anupaat main hogi
 In the measurement of this visual radiance, the sun has a radius of - 26
72, a moon of - 12
5 and a star with a fading star - 1

 mount palomar vedhashala ke 200 inch vyas ke paravarti doordarshee se ham 23 kantimaan tak ke taare dekh sakate hai
 Current measurement means the measurement of the intensity of starlight
 pehle yah kaary vishesh prakaar ke photomeateron kii sahaayta se aankhon dwaara kiya jaataa tha
 The records obtained in this way are called visual records
 ankhen pile prakaash kii sugrahi hai, at: drishyakantimaan pile or hare rang ke prakaash ke maapak hai
 Later the decoction was done with the help of photography plates
 is prakaar se gyaat kaantikan ko photography kantimaan kehete hai
 Photographic currents are measures of blue light
 taare kai rangon ke prakaash vikeern karte hai
 Therefore, the intensity of light is measured by sensitized plates of different colors and by the use of pigments to determine the strength of stars
 pile rang kii sugrahi platon par pile rangashodhakon se photography tathaa drishy kantimanon ke antar ko varna suchak kehete hai
 This determines the temperature of the wires
 kantimaan photograhi selon par prakaash ko grahan kar tathaa use bahugunit kar prakaash kii tivrata maapi jaati he
 While measuring current we also have to keep in mind the effect of the atmosphere and the effect of the interstellar dust and gases of the stars
 kantimaan ke yatharth gyaan se hamen taron kii dooriyaan tathaa bahut se bhautik padaartho ko jaanane main sahaayta milti he
 The personal light of many stars is very high, but due to being stationary at a great distance, their visible record is more visible
 yatharth kantimaan to tabhi gyaat ho saktaa he, jab ve upamaatr se samaan duuri par sthit hon
 All the stars are imagined at a distance of 10 parsecs, and the known value is called absolute value
 yadi hamen taare kaa drishy kantimaan gyaat ho tathaa uski duuri gyaat ho to ham nimnlikhit sutara se nirpeksh kantimaan jaan sakate hai: 5– 5 logarithmic distances are in the parsecs
 vilomat: yadi hamen nirpeksh kantimaan gyaat ho to ham taron kii dooriyaan bhi jaan sakate hai
 The absolute record of the Sun is 4
7
 kisi taare kii surya ke saapeksh kanti ko saapeksh kanti kehete hai
 In this, the radian of the Sun is assumed to be 1
 is prakaar ke adhyayan se ham taron se praapt honevaali urja kaa adhyayan karte hai, jisase unki bhautik sthitiyon ke adhyayan main sahaayta milti he
 No 8 no purnataya nirmal akaash main hamen drushti sahaayak yantron ke 3,200 se adhik taare nahin dikhalaai padate
 Since we can see only half of the sky, the number of microscopic stars is about 6,500
 inamen 20 stars brighter than 1,5 radiance 2 kantimaan tak chamkile 50 taare hai 150 stars up to 3 radiant 4 kantimaan tak chamkile 500 taare hai Tara 5 shines to 1500 bright stars shesh chakshudrishy taare chathe kantimaan ke he
 If we make our vision 10 times inward, then the number of visible stars will increase by 1000 times, that is, if the stars are assumed to be spread evenly, then their number will increase by six times their distance
 yah sambandh adhik chamkile taron tak hi simit he
 The number of stars known by the largest telescope in a lesser galaxy is about 1, xxwrep 2 00, 000
 taare kii vaastavik gati tathaa gamandisha gyaat karne ke liye ham uski gati ko do bhaagon main baant lete hai
 The angular value of the motion of the perpendicular direction on the sight is called the private motion of the star
 taron kii nijee gatiyaan kam hotin hai
 In order to find them we have to compare the photographs of stars taken in very distant times
 jo taare hamaare nikat hai, ve doorvarti taron ke saapeksh aage peeche hat jate hai
 By dividing this angular value by the interval of time, the individual speeds become known
 is koniya drushtisutra kii disha kii tarak gati ko traigy veg kehete hai
 To find the radial velocity, we take the spectrum of stars with the help of spectroscopy
 yadi varnakram rekhaayen nile chor kii taraf hati hon, to ham dopalar sidwant kii sahaayta se jaan lete hai ki tara hamaari ore aa rahaa he tathaa, yadi varnakram rekhaayen laal chor kii ore hati hon, to ham se dur ja rahaa he
 The transfer of lines is inversely proportional to their triangulation
 banard ne ophiukas taramandal ke ek dashm kantiman ke taare kii nijee gati 10
3 prati varsh gyaat kii he, jo vishaltam he
 Knowledge of private motion is helpful in the study of the stars and from this we also know that the stars of more blue motion are relatively closer to us
 traigy veg kaa surya ke saapeksh gyaan karne ke liye, hamen prithvi kii gati ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana padataa he
 The knowledge of private motion and radial velocity makes the actual speed and its direction known by the principle of force-parallel-quadrilateral
 taron kii dooriyaan gyaat karne ke liye trikoshmetiya vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The star closest to us is also at such a distance that if we consider the diameter of the Earth as its base, then they seem to be parallel, that is, the parallax of the star is zero
 at: taron ke lamban ko gyaat karne ke liye hamen bade aadhaar kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Therefore, we base the diameter of the Earth's orbit
 yadi ham kisi taare kii disha ke ek vedh ke chha: maheene baad uskaa vegh karen to hamen prithvi kii kaksha ke vyas kaa aadhaar mil jaataa he
 With this type of perforation, the nearest stars show slight changes relative to the distant stars
 ise nikaalte samay hamen taare kii nijee gati ke prabhaav par bhi vichaar karnaa padataa he
 Even then it is so low that the parallax of the nearest star is 76
 yadi kisi taare kaa lamban 1 ho to vah prithvi se prithvi kii kaksha kii trigya se 2,06,265 guni duuri par hota he
 This distance is called a parsec
 duuri maapne ke liye jis anya ikai kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, vah he prakashavarsh 
 The velocity of light is 1,86,000 miles per second
 is veg se prakaash ek varsh main jitani duuri tak jaataa he utani duuri ko ek prakaash varsh kehete hai yah duuri lagbhag 60, xxwrep 2 00, 000 mile hoti he
 a parsec is about 3
26 light years
 trikoshmetiya vidhi se ham keval atyant samipsth taron kii dooriyaan hi gyaat kar sakate hai
 Therefore, to find the distances of distant stars, we have to take shelter of other methods
 yadi ham kisi prakaar taron ke nirpeksh kantimaan ko jaan saken, to ham nirpeksh kantimaan sheershak main die gaye sutara kii sahaayta se unki dooriyaan gyaat kar sakate hai
 Fortunately, we have stars of Cefide and Lyra, whose absolute values we can find
 taron ke lambnon ko gyaat karne kii nimnlikhit anya vidhiyaan hai: These classifications have personal significance and they give us special help in the analysis of stars
 in vargikarnon kaa sankshipt parichay nimnlikhit he: The Sun is our nearest star, which we can study very well
 taron ke tatwon ke adhyayan se hamen adhikansh taare aise uplabdh hote he, jinka janm lagbhag usee samay hua jis samay hamaare surya kaa
 These stars are in descending sequence of temperature, shape and radiance
 is varg ko mukhya anukram kehete hai
 In this, the size of the stars of extreme heat will be about 10 times the size of the Sun and the size of the stars of the lower temperature will be about 10 times the size of the Sun and the size of the stars of the lower temperature will be about the tithe of the Sun
 surya isi anukram kaa ek majhole aakaar kaa tara he, jisaki dravyamatra tathaa taap ausat se kam he
 Upward stars in the curve of the main sequence are extremely rare
 is anukram ke adhikansh taare surya se chote tathaa kam taap ke hai
 The amount of elements available in them is like the Sun
 surya ke adhyayan se ham is varg ke atirikt taron ke do or mukhya varg he: daanavaakar taron ke teen mukhya bhed hai
 Dancing, and leftward stars
 daanavaakar taron ke teen mukhya bhed - daanavkaar, ati daanavaakar tathaa upadanavaakar 
 Extravagant stars are very large in size
 udaahranarth, jyeshtha kaa vyas surya ke vyas kaa lagbhag 300 guna he
 In celestial stars, the diameter of the second beta pigassi of the Khagashv is 170 times the diameter of the Sun and that of the Brahmin is 12 times the diameter of the Sun
 upadanavaakar taare mukhya anukram tathaa daanav varg ke taara ke bich sthit hai
 Left-wing stars also have Vamana, Upavaman, Lalrang Vamana and white-vamana distinction
 in virgon main shwet vamanakaar taare apana vishesh mahatv rakhte hai
 Their specialty is that their mass volume is mid-range and less radiant, but their size is very small and their density is extremely high
 hamen jitne taare dikhaai dete hai, unamem atyadhik maatra main ve taare hai, jo hamaari gallexi ke sadsy hai
 Our Galaxy is a world in itself
 iskaa aakaar sarpil he
 There are many other celestials, which have a spiral shape
 unki rachana tathaa akruti kaa adhyayan karne ke liye hamen apni akashganga ke kuch vishesh prakaar ke taron ke adhyayan se sahaayta milti he
 There are mainly two classes of these stars
 kuch taare sadaa gallexi kii sarpil bhujaaon main uplabdh hote hai tathaa anya gallexi ke nabhik ke nikat paae jate hai
 Among them, the stars of the first class are immediate neighbors of our Sun and the stars of the second class are away from the Sun
 walter wade ne pratham varg ke taron kaa naam pratham tara shrenee, athwa population pratham, tathaa duusare varg ke taron kaa naam dwitiya tara shrenee, athwa population dwitiya rakhaa he
 Both of these types of Taravargo vary in spectral-radius-curves
 pratham tarashrenee ke atyant chamkile taare nile rang ke hote hai tathaa unka nirpeksh kantimaan 7 athwa 8 hota he, jabaki dwitiya tarashrenee ke atyant chamkile taare laal rang ke hote hai tathaa unka nirpeksh kantimaan - 3 yaa usase adhik hota he
 In the stars of the first star, there is an excessive amount of interstellar gas and dust, while in the stars of the second star it is very small
 in tarashreniyon ke adhyayan se hame gallexion kii sarpil bhujaaon tathaa nabhikon ko nishchit karne maatr ke hi liye nahin, kintu inase hamen taron kii utpatti tathaa vikaas kii sthiti kaa adhyayan karne main bhi sahaayta milti he
 Molecules of the mass of stars, which remain neutral in the atmosphere, become ionized due to the progressive increase in temperature and they lose more and more of their negative electrons
 iske prabhaav se aise taron ke varnakram main bananevaali chamakili or kaali rekhaon main vibhinnata aa jaati he
 In other words, the lines represent the different states of heat of the molecules that radiate the light of stars
 is prakaar taron ke varnakramon ke adhyayan se unke mukhya 10 bhed kiye gaye hai, jinhen roman lipi ke bade aksharon o, bi, e, epa, ji, ke, em, aar, en, tathaa es se vyakt karte hai
 Since alphabetical classification is related to temperature, the smaller alphabet a to e of the English alphabet is placed after o for strings of o spectrum and O, to show successive degradation of the temperature of the same class of stars
 Oba etc
 isi prakaar ke abhipraay ko vyakt karne ke liye bi se em ke varnakram ke taron ke liye unke suchak aksharon ke baad 0 se lekar 9 tak ke ank rakhe jate hai
 These are ionized helium stars
 inke varnakramon main ynikrut helium tathaa dohare tihare ynikrut oxigen tathaa nitrogen kii rekhaayen praapt hotin hai
 According to this ionized state, its surface temperature should be from 30, xxrep 4 0 to 40, xxrep 4 0 c or more
 o varnakram ke gyaat taron kii sankhya sau se adhik nahin he, jinamein adhikash nangi aankhon se nahin dekhe ja sakate
 The three stars of this class, Gama Beloram Oy, Zeta Pappis Oy and Zitaorayan, are Oi5 Chakshu Darshan
 ye udasin helium vaale taare hai
 Their surface temperature ranges from 25,000 ° to 12,000 ° C
 yah taap yadhyapi helium ko ynikrut karne main asamarth he, tathaapi iske varnakram main ynikrut oxigen rekhaayen uplabdh hotin hai
 Helium and ionized oxygen lines begin to decrease in stars from the B5 star to the lower heat, and hydrogen lines and broad black absorption lines of hydrogen emerge
 hamaari tarasuchiyon main bi taare bahut hai
 These are the major stars of hydrogen
 inkaa prishthiya taap 12,000° se lekar 8,000° sein0 tak he
 Their number is very high
 kuch jyotishi inhe calcium taare kehete the
 Their surface heat ranges from 8,000 ° to 6,000 ° 0
 ye surya kii shrenee ke taare hai
 The lines of ionized calcium in their alphabet are very prominent
 inkaa prishthiya taap 6,000° se lekar 4,000° sein0 tak he
 12,000 ° g spectral stars have been identified
 inkaa prishthiya taap 5,000° se lekar 3,5000 sein° tak hota he
 Earlier they were known as Suryakalanka stars
 titonium oride taare
 Their surface heat ranges from 3,500 ° to 2,000 ° C
 inamen praaia: sabhi chal taare hai, jinamein keval chakshudrishy koi nahin he
 Their surface heat ranges from 3,000 ° to 5,000 ° N
 ye sabhi daanavaakar tathaa adhikanshat: chal taare hai
 These are very few in number
 inamen se koi bhi tara keval chakshu se saraltapurvak drishy nahin he
 There are some stars whose radiance keeps decreasing
 inhen chal taare kehete hai
 In order to give clear instructions of movable stars, big letters of English alphabet R, S, t etc
 are placed in front of the constellation, like r SETI etc
 inaki sankhya badhane ke saath ek akshar ke sthaan par do athwa teen akshar bhi rakhane pad sakate hai, yatha aar aar lira aadi
 About 20,000 movable stars are known and they are weighed regularly
 taron ke do vishaal varg hai: pehla bahyahetuk chal tathaa doosraa swat: chal
 Extraterrestrial moving stars are receptive pair stars
 inamen algul tara prasiddh he
 Its normal record is 2
2, but it goes up to 3
4
 swat: chal taare teen shreniyon main rakhe ja sakate hai: sapandansheel chal, visphotak chal tathaa anya chal taare
 Some of these stars have a rotation period of less than a day
 aise taare aar aar lira varg ke hai
 The rotation period of some is from 1 to 50 days
 aise taare sefiid varg ke taare hai
 The rotation period of some stars ranges from 100 to 1000 days
 inhen dirdh aavartkaalik taare kehete hai
 The stars of this class are red colored stars
 kuch taare ardhniyamit chal hai, inkaa chakra 40 se lekar 150 din tak kaa he
 These stars are also red colored stars
 inamen aar aar lira tathaa sefiid taare atyant mahatvapurn hai
 r Lyra stars got its name because all of these properties are similar to the moving star described in Lyra Planetarium, which was named RR Lyra
 naam se yah na samajhnaa chahie ki aise taare keval lira taramandal main hi hote hai, kintu is shrenee ke taare hamaari gallexi tathaa anya tarapranaliyon aadi main sarvatra hai
 The reason for the importance of these stars is their distancing
 aar aar lira varg ke taron main aavartankaal ke badhane par par bhi unke nirpeksh kantimaan main antar nahin padataa
 This means that if one of the galaxial stars has RR Lyra stars, they will be of the same absolute radius and it is almost equal to zero of the same absolute radius
 aisi avasthaa main unke drishy kantimaan ke gyaan se unki duuri nimnlikhit sutara dwaara gyaat ho sakati he
 Absolute radius = visual radius + 5 - 5 logarithmic distance inkaa yah naam isliye padaa ki inaki prakruti delta sefius, athwa chartuth kapish, kii tarah kii he
 The fourth Auburn is the brightest star in the Cepheid category, which can be seen from the eye
 sefiod taron kaa aavartankaal ek din se kuch adhik se lekar 45 din se kuch adhik he
 Our galaxy's cepheid stars often have a 7-day rotation period
 sefiid taron kii sabase badi visheshta he inkaa aavartankaal-kanti-saahchary niyam se sangat hona
 This means that as the growth period of the cepheid wires increases, their absolute value increases
 yah sambandh atyant mahatvapurn he
 With its help, the distance can be determined by the previous formula by knowing the absolute value of the safe stars
 sefiid taron kii sahaayta se taragucchon tathaa tarapaddatiyon kii duuri gyaat kii jaati hai
 The reason for the change of thermogenic color is generally assumed to be the flutter principle, which means that the rotation of the surface of the cepheid wires causes growth and depletion, causing the star to expand and shrink sequentially
 vastut: spandan siddhant sabhi sthitiyon kaa yatharth uttar nahin detaa
 Therefore, nowadays astrologers are beginning to understand that the different positions of cefoid stars are due to the change of their temperature, which itself is an iterative cycle
 1,000 se adhik sefiid taare gyaat he
 Such wires explode regularly or irregularly
 ye taare saamanyat: atyant dhundle hote hai, kintu visphot hone ke baad inaki kanti atyant asaadhaaran rup se bad jaati he
 After this situation lasts for a few days, the stars fall into their normal radius
 is prakaar ke taron ko navtara kehete hai
 In 1918, the glow of the Navatar of Aquila Tarapunja had increased by forty thousand times within four days
 anya prasiddh navtare hai: parasyus taramandal kaa navtara, 1925 i0 victoris navtara tathaa 1934 i0 kaa harkulis taramandal kaa navtara
 Those who become very exceptionally bright after the Navatarite explosion are called Atinavatara
 1885 i0 ke andromida niharika ke atinavtaare ne chah dinon main itnaa adhik prakaash vikeern kiya ki surya kadachit utane prakaash ko 10 lakh varsho main vikeern kar paaegaa
 Other types of moving stars are often of irregular rotation
 kisi svachh raatri main akaash main kuch dhundle prakaash ke dhabbe se dikhaai dete hai
 If we look at them with powerful instruments, then we find three types of things: star flakes, nebulae and galaxies
 niharikas chamakili gaison se bani hai tathaa aakashgangaayen hamaari gallexi kii tarah swatantra tarapranaliyaan hai
 There are two types of star flakes, one that is available in the sky-like plane, or near the celestial spiral arms
 aise guchchhe akashgangeey guchchhe kehalaate hai
 The number of stars in these is relatively less
 is prakaar ke varg main krittika tara guchchhe atyadhik chamkila tathaa bada he
 The globular globules lie away from the spiral arms and near the nucleus
 golakaar taragucchon main apekshaakrit atyaadhik taare rahete hai
 They are often seen with a twist
 inhen doordarshiyon se hi dekha jaataa he
 The Ombanga Sentari and 47 Tukane Panchal Kantiman, Chakshudhishyas, are related to the population of the spherical galaxy
 avashya hi inase taron ke vikaas kii avasthaaon kaa gyaan hota he
 The distance of the cluster is determined with the help of the RR Lyra and cepheid wires present in these wires
 inke adhyayan se gallexi ke swaroop ke adhyayan main bahut sahaayta milti he
 Most stars are double, or majority, they do not have anything interconnected in pairs of stars, but they appear very close because they are located towards our line of sight
 aise taron ko chakshush, dohare taare kehete hai
 Such stars are few
 adhikansh taare vastut: ek yaa adhik taron ke saath hai
 Two stars, which travel in a certain type of longitudinal path with mutual attraction, are called star-pairs
 yah nishchay ho jane par ki koi tara vastut: yugma hai, ham uske sambandh kii bahut si baaten gyaat kar sakate hai, kyonki uski, athwa uske saathi tara kii, gati vyapak gurutvkarshan niyam kaa paalan karti hai
 The speed and mass of the pair wires can be determined with certainty
 yugmatare mukhyatya teen prakaar ke hote hai: drishy, grahauakari tathaa varnakrameey 
 To know the class of visual pair, one has to weigh their distance and angle of view
 adhikansh drishy yugmataron kaa parikramankal bahut lanbaa hota he, jise gyaat karne ke liye saikadon varshon tak vegh kii aavashyaktaa he
 Therefore, although more than 25,000 visual pairings have been known, the knowledge of more than 200 orbits is not yet known
 grahauakari yugmatare ke sahchar kii kaksha praaia: hamaari drushtirekha kii disha main thode se jhukaav se rahati he, jisase ek tara duusare ko purnataya yaa khandash: dhak letaa he or isse ek taare kaa prakaash hamen dikhaai nahin padataa
 This allows the pair to be identified, because in normal conditions, the amount of light that this star has remains at the time of eclipse decreases
 yah grahan kii sthiti niyat samay se hotin hai
 In such strings, the Beta percussion, that is, Algool, is very famous
 saamaanya avasthaa main iskaa kantimaan 2
2 hota he, ja grahan ke samay 3
4 rah jaataa he
 After the eclipse, its record becomes 2
2 again
 kuch yugmataron ke sahchar kii kaksha kaa samtal prithvi ke sameep se nahin jaataa, at: ham uske grahan kii sthiti nahin dekh sakate hai
 But by changing the lines of its spectrum, we get to know that this star sometimes comes towards us and sometimes goes away from us, so that it is clear that it is flying around an invisible star
 aise taare varnakrameey yugmataron kaa parikraman kaal kam hota he
 Classes of about 309 spectral stars have been known
 taron ke aakaar praaia: teen vidhiyon se jane jate hai: From absolute temperature and temperature, grahauakari yugmataron ke grahankaal se tathaa By interferometer
 pratham vidhi plank ke nimnlikhit sutara par aadhaarit he: View Absolute Record Mvis = - 5 log - 0
08 jahaan r = taare kii trigya he
 The radius relative to its orbit becomes known by the time of eclipse of the eclipse star
 vyatikaranmaapi se taare kaa koniya vyas gyaat ho jaataa he tathaa isaki duuri gyaat hone se iskaa saral rekhaatmak vyas bhi gyaat ho jaataa he
 On the basis of the diameter of the stars, their names are donated and left
 taron kii dravyamatra gyaat karne kii pratyaksh vidhi yugma taron ke sahachaar kii gati kaa adhyayan karne se praapt hotin hai
 The mass quantities of these stars are determined with the help of the law of gravitation
 kisi bhi vaaman taare kii dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra ke dashamansh se kam nahin uplabdh hui hai, tathaa surya se 10 guni se adhik dravyamatra ke taare bhi viral hi hai
 Density of a star = mass / volume
 is prakaar dekhne se pataa chalata he ki daanavaakar taron kaa ghanatv atyant kam hota he tathaa vamanakaar taron kaa atyadhik
 The diameter of a giant star like Jyeshta is 480 times the diameter of the Sun, even if its mass is no more than 20 times the mass of the Sun
 parinamat: iskaa ghanatv surya ke ghanatv ke 
 xxrep 7 0 2 se bhi kam he
 It is also much lower than the density of ordinary air
 shwetavaman taare sirium bi kaa, jisaki trigya surya kii trigya kii 
034 tathaa dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra kii 86 he, ghanatv itnaa adhik he ki uske dravya ke ek ghan inch kaa bhaar ek ton hoga
 Normally with the help of a photometer, by comparing the density of different colors of starlight with the density of colors already known in the laboratory, the surface temperature of stars can be determined
 kintu iske nishchit rup se gyaat karne kii sarvottam vidhi he, unke prakaash kaa varnakrameey vishleshan
 On the basis of this, there is a spectral classification of stars, which literally signifies their temperature
 taare apni urja nabhikeey abhikriya se praapt karte hai
 Due to the heating of the star's nucleus, the hydrogen atoms of the stars are converted from the nucleus to the atoms of helium
 iske parinaam swaroop taron main atyadhik taap kii utpatti hotin hai, jise ye prakaash ke rup main vikeern karte rahete hai
 They have to lose very little power to generate a lot of energy
 atev inaki dravyamatra main koi baari kami nahin hoti tathaa inkaa jivan bhi karodon varshon kaa ho jaataa he
 The atmosphere of stars is also studied by the lines of the spectrum
 surya ke vayumandal ke adhyayan se hamen pataa chalaa he ki isamen hydrogen atyadhik maatra main hai
 The second place is of helium
 anya tatv kam maatra main hai, tathaapi magnesium or oxigen ke parmaanu nishchit rup se vidyaman hai
 Of the known chemical elements, 61 elements have been identified in the Sun's atmosphere
 adhikashan taron kaa vayumandal surya sareekha he, tathaapi sabhi taron kaa vayumandal bilkul ek sa nahin he
 There is a difference between the amounts of carbon and oxygen in them
 taron ke mul tatwon ko unke varnakram kii rekhaon ke adhyayan se janaa jaataa he
 In the laboratory, the spectrums of the different basic elements are taken, and by matching them to the spectrum of the stars, the basic elements available in the stars are identified
 is prakaar ke adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki ausat taron main lagbhag 70 heidrogen, 28 helium, 1
5 carbon, nitrogen, oxigen tathaa niann or 0
5 loh varg ke tathaa anya baari tatv hote hai
 The heavy element population first wires have about 3 and the population second ones have less than 1
 taron kaa janm taron ke antarvarti gas tathaa dhul ke kanon se hota he
 The electrophoresis of gas clouds usually remain in a neutral state, but when a very hot star moves near them, they ionize and move and form a nucleus, attracting the masses of gas and dust around them
 Starts wearing huge forms
 gati tathaa sankochan se nabhik kaa taap badhane par, inamen nabhikeey abhikriya prarambh ho jaati he, jisase ye prakaash urja ko vikeern karne lagate tathaa hamen nae taron ke swaroop main dikhalaai dene lagate hai
 Studies of the energy radiations of various types of stars have shown that the stars of Population II are very ancient and the stars of Population i are relatively later
 taron ke jivan se taatpary unke prakashmay jivan se hota he
 The basis of the light of stars is their reserves of hydrogen, from which they receive heat energy by nuclear reaction
 jo taare atyadhik chamkile hai, swabhaavat: ve apane hydrogen ke bhandar kaa adhikadhik upbhog karke use adhik shighrata se helium main parivartit karte rahete hai
 Although stars can regain their heat energy for many years by shrinking their hydrogen reserves, their main basis of life depends on their hydrogen intake
 jo taare atyadhik chamkile dikhalaai dete hai, unka jeevankaal 109 varsh ke lagbhag tathaa mukhya anukram ke dhundle taaro kaa jeevankaal 1013 varsh ke lagbhag hota he
 The life of the Sun is about 1010 years
 apane chaaron ore faile hue taramay vishwa ke rahasy ko jaanane kii hamaari ichha bahut puraani he
 By studying the stars, we have found the world to be full of many galaxies like the Galaxy
 laal rang kii ore rekhaon ke sthanrann dwaara hamane taron ke varnakramon ke adhyayan se itnaa jaan liya he ki hamaara vishwa fail rahaa he
 However, due to our limited means, we have not been able to know the true form of the world
