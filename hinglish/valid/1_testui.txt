 Mysore Narasimhachar Srinivas was a renowned sociologist of India
 unhone dakshin bharat main jati tathaa jati pratha, saamaajik starikaran, saanskritikaran tathaa pashchimikaran par kaary kiya
 They presented the concept of 'dominant caste'
 'mysore narsinhachaar shrinivas' ko san 1977 main bharat sarkaar dwaara vigyaan evam abhiyantriki ke kshetra main padam bhushan se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 They are from Karnataka
 aupchaarik rup se bhartiya samajashaastra ke aadi-purush bhale hi na hon, lekin swatantra bharat main is anushaasan ko unhone apane saidhantik yogadan, jati kii vilakshan samaj or sahabhaagi prekshan kii paddati ke istemaal se jitna samrudh kiya he vah unhen desh ke shirshatam samaaj-vigyaniyon main shaamil karne ke liye paryaapt he
 In sociology, he is known for his original foundations like Sanskritisation, dominant caste and vote bank
 shrinivas sansthaaon ke nirmaataa bhi the
 He is credited for the establishment of departments of sociology in Baroda and Delhi University
 shodh or adhyayan ke ucchstareey sansthaanon kii sthapana or disha-nirdesan ke lihaaz se bhi bhartiya samajashaastra ke vikaas main unka yogadan kaaljayi mana jayega
 Apart from a specific study of rural community and caste structure, M
N
 Srinivas has also done thought provoking work on topics such as social impact of science, Gandhi's religious thinking, history of anthropology and gender
 shrinivas kaa krititv vastunishth paryvekshan, vishleshan kii maheentaon tathaa saidhantik gaharaai kaa durlabh sangam mana jaataa he
 His writing provides a particular ground context for inter-subjectivity
 shrinivas kii samajashastreey drushti ghatnaon kii bahari banaavat ko bhed kar unhen gadhane vaali sanrachanaon or aitihaasik shaktiyon kii thaah leti he
 His ability to present the nuanced details and insights of community life in simple language gives him a distinct personality from contemporary sociologists
 is arth main ve vishaygat shabdaawalee kaa atikaraman karte hue saadhaaran or prachlit bhashaa ko chunate hai
 It will be called the democracies of his scholarship that his theoretical concepts help in understanding the subject rather than engaging in his own ideas
 shrinivas ne vicharadhara ke str par bhartiya samajashaastra ke liye ek nayi zamin taiyaar kii
 It is worth mentioning that at the time when Srinivas was preparing to study Indian society, American and British academic installations dominated social sciences
 america vishvavidhyalayon main prachlit drushtikon bhartiya upmahadweep ke samaaj ko samajhane ke liye sanskritnishtha paramparaon par jor detaa tha
 As a result, Indian sociologists considered Sanskrit sources and Indology / Indology to be more authentic for the study of contemporary reality
 shrinivas pehle samajashastri the jinhone is varchasvkaari sthiti ko chunauti di
 He proved from his writings that in sociology, the study of the actual activities and activities of society is better than relying on classical references
 shrinivas dwaara prastut prabhutvshaalee jati tathaa samskruthikaran kii avadharanaon kaa raajnneeti vigyaniyon ke alaava itihaas-lekhan kii sabaltern jaisi dhaaraon ke itihaaskaaron ne vyapak prayog kiya gaya he
 In this sense, his work can be placed in the category of an intellectual tradition which has acquired the status of an important reference for new and old scholars
 prasangvash, prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana sankhya bal, bhu-swaamitv, shiksha or naukari jaise karkon ke kaaran kisi jati ke gaanv yaa kshetra vishesh main dabadabe ko jaahir karti he to samskruthikaran nimna jatiyon dwaara ucch jatiyon khaas taur par brahman varg kii samskruti, reeti-rivaazon, bhashaa or veshbhusha aadi ko apnaane kii pravriti ko gyaapit karti he
 Though his third concept vote bank could not make a permanent place in social sciences, the term is used indiscriminately in the daily discourse of politics and media world
 swatantra bharat kii raajnneetik or saamaajik sanrachana ke adhyayan main ye teenon avadharanaayen or usase jude vimarsh tattvik mahatva hasil kar chuke hai
 The concepts of dominant caste and culturalization help in understanding the decisive elements of India's social system and its organizational structure
 haalaanki brahmnavaadi aadarshon kii ghatati vaidhata ke kaaran samskruthikaran kii avadharana ab utani mahatvapurn nahin maani jaati lekin yah tathy he ki beesvin sadi ke ek bade kalkhand or swatantraaa ke baad bhi lambe samay tak samskruthikaran ek kaasi ullekhneey pravriti thi
 In the politics that emerged after the Dalit movement and the Mandal Commission, the trend of Sanskritisation has weakened, but the concept of dominant caste is still seen as an essential tool in analyzing the political processes in rural society in India
 kai samakaleen samajashastri shrinivas ke krititv ko rashtravaadi samajashaastra ke brihattar sandarbh main rakhkar aankane kaa aagrah karte rahe hai
 He says that the urban elite of independent India wanted to continue the project of modernization of colonial rule
 isliye rashtravaadi samajashastriyon ke krititv main chintan or vichaar kii vahi aupniveshik saraniyan sakriy thi jinke aadhaar par british satta apane shashan ko vaid tehraati aayi thi
 These scholars say that the work of sociologists like Srinivas focused on caste and community provides a benchmark for understanding of an all-india Sanskritist Hinduism
 lekin shrinivas kii drushti ko prakat yaa aprakat taur par british yaa america maanavshaastra kii sthapanaaon se nirdeshit bataanaa jaldbaaji kii daleel he jo subooton kii kami ke baavjood aarope patr taiyaar karne kii himakat karti he
 This argument fails to target the tendency of Srinivasa's work in which Srinivas studies the community and also considers the duality of the community and its relations
 shrinivas samajashaastra or maanavshaastra kii buniyadi prasthaapanaaon par bhi thik isi tarah vichaar karte hai
 It is worth noting that Srinivas defines himself as a fellow scholar, as a fellow scholar, whose identity is not different from his subject ie people
 shrinivas jin logon yaa samudaay kaa adhyayan karte the unhen ve anya kii shrenee main nahin rakhte the
 In this regard, many British anthropologists have believed that anthropologists studying their society face different kinds of difficulties
 unke anusaar viksit desh kaa maanavshastri ek deshaj maanavshastri ko uski nimnatar sthiti kii ore ishaara karke hameshaa ek khaas saanche main kaid rakhana chahta he
 Srinivas, while clarifying the position of the indigenous anthropologist on this issue, wrote that when an Indian anthropologist studies any caste or other group of India, that caste or group is other for him but at the same time does not ignore this
 It should be done that certain cultural forms, beliefs and values of that caste or group also match the said scholar
 yani aisi sthiti main bhartiya maanavshastri asal main ek tarah se anya main swa kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 In this sense, that caste or group is not completely unfamiliar to him or her as both are connected to the same culture
 shrinivas is sthiti ko asaamaanya dhang se jatil, bahuparti or dwaidhapurna maanate hai
 Looking carefully, Srinivas does not seem to be accused of being a nationalist sociologist given the points of difference and equality with his subject
 vastav main shrinivas is baat par jor dete hai ki adhyayan main aatm or anya kii yah bahulata maanavshastri ke apane samudaay kaa sadsy hone yaa bahari hone kii ekalata se kahin zyaada shreyaskar he
 It is noteworthy that he uses many observations from the Chicago School to study the caste system of the village of Rampura, which was chosen by Srinivas for his research studies
 varna kii prak-british avadharana ko shrinivas kitaabi nazariyaa siddh karte hue yah kehete hai ki yah drushti jati ke gatisheel pakshon ko gaun kar detii he
 Although Srinivas's caste-study focused on the local structure of a village, he was also conscious of the pan-india prevalence of this phenomenon
 apane ek lekh main ve is tathy kii ore ishaara karte hai ki jati nihsandeh ek akhil bhartiya sanrachana he, kyonki desh main har jagah aise samooh dekhe ja sakate hai jo paitrukataa tathaa vaivaahik sambandhon ke aadhaar par ek vishisht samooh kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Srinivas also cites traditional employment of these groups in this regard
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki desh main har jagah brahman, achhut, kisaan, dastkaar, vyapaaree or dusron kii seva karne vaali jatiyon kaa astitv dekha ja saktaa he
 In this caste study, Srinivas also mentions regional variations and factors such as western education, administrative jobs, city income, which have had a major impact on the caste structure
 is tarah deergh avadhi ke lihaaj se dekhen to ek samajashastri ke taur par shrinivas ne bhartiya gram or jati kii sanrachana ko aupniveshik dharanaon ke saidhantik varchasv se bhi mukt karaayaa he
 At the same time, he also countered the beliefs of sociologists like Dumon who were proposing that caste differences do not allow the Indian village to become a community
 shrinivas jab gramin samudaay kii sankalpana or gaanvon kii aarthik-saanskrithik antar-nirbharta kii baat karte hai to ve avyakt dhang se akhil bhartiya sabhyataa kii baat bhi karte hai
 Some scholars believe that Srinivas has adopted a Brahminical or upper caste point of view in the study of caste
 lekin is daleel ko sahi kone se dekhen to vah darasal aupniveshik samajashaastra se nikali prathit hoti he
 Srinivas's logic-plan actually exposes the macro and under-concerned perceptions of Western sociologists regarding India's rural communities
 sankshep main kaha jaae to shrinivas kaa krititv pashchimi gyanshastreey prasthaapanaaon, swa, samudaay tathaa raashtra kii dharanaon ke aalochakeey vimarsh main kai buniyadi tark muhaiyaa karaata he

 wali yaa baali ramayana kaa ek paatr he
 He was the elder brother of Sugriva
 vah kiskindha kaa raja tha tathaa indra kaa putr bataaya jaataa he
 Rama, the incarnation of Vishnu, killed him
 haalaanki ramayana kii pustak kiskindhakand ke 67 adhyyon main se adhyay 5 se lekar 26 tak hi wali kaa varnan kiya gaya he, phir bhi ramayana main wali kii ek mukhya bhoomika rahi he, visheshkar uske vadh ko lekar
 An interesting episode exists about the birth of Vali
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki wali indra or arun kaa putr tha
 Indra was the king of the gods and Arun the charioteer of Suryadev
 aisi manyata he ki surya rose saat safed ghodon ke rath main subah aate hai jiskaa sanchaalan arun karata he
 Once upon a time, some sage cursed the sun that he would not be luminous on the earth
 kyonki surya ne iske pashchaat rath kii sawari band kar di atah arun ke paas koi kaam nahin rahaa
 Arun had already wished to go to heaven and see the divine dance of the Apsaras
 usne is avasar kaa laabh uthaakar ek yuvati kaa vesh dhaaran kiya or apsaraon kaa nrity dekhne swarg lok pahunch gaya
 Indra, who was enjoying this dance, saw a young woman like Arun and was fascinated by it
 donon ne samagam kiya or kalantar main arun ne wali ko janm diya
 Wali was raised by Ahilya, wife of Gautam Rishi
 vanar raaj wali Vali was married to Tara, daughter of the monkey Vaidyaraja Sushen
 ek katha ke anusaar samudr manthan ke dauraan chaudaa maniyon main se ek apsaraayen thim
 One of those nymphs was Tara
 wali or sushen donon manthan main devatagan kii madad kar rahe the
 When they saw Tara, both of them vied to make her a wife
 wali tara ke dahini taraf tathaa sushen uske baayin taraf khadey ho gayi
 Then Vishnu decided that at the time of marriage, the girl is her husband on the right side and the father who gives the bride on the left side
 atah wali tara kaa pati tathaa sushen uskaa pita ghoshit kiye gayi
 It is said that Vali received a gold necklace from his father Indra, who was blessed by Brahma with a mantra that by wearing it, whenever he faces his enemy in the battlefield, half of his enemy's power will be depleted and Vali Will be received
 is kaaran se wali lagbhag ajey tha
 There is such an incident in Ramayana that once Vali was going to Sandhyavandan, Narada Muni was going from the sky
 wali ne unka abhivadan kiya to naarad ne bataaya ki vah lanka ja rahe hai jahaan lankapati ravan ne devraj indra ko parrast karne ke upalaksh main bhoj kaa aayojan kiya he
 Narada of a fickle nature - who is omniscient - tried to pinch Vali and said that now only Ravana is the supreme being in the entire universe and all beings, even the gods, give him the title
 wali ne kaha ki ravan ne apane vardaan or apni sena kaa istemaal unako dabaane main kiya he jo nirbal hai lekin main unamem se nahin hoon or aap yah baat ravan ko spasht kar den
 The omniscient Narada told the same thing to Ravana, who got angry on hearing Ravana
 usne apni sena taiyaar karne ke aadesh de daale
 Narada also took a pinch from him that if you take the entire army for a monkey, it will not be appropriate for your honor
 ravan turant maan gaya or apane puspak vimaan main baithkar wali ke paas pahunch gaya
 At that time, Vali was doing evening
 wali kii swarnamayi kanti dekhakar ravan ghabara gaya or wali ke peeche se waar karne kii cheshtaa kii
 Vali was engrossed in his worship of Archana, but still he held him by his tail and pressed his head beside him and roamed the whole world
 usne aisa isliye kiya ki sampurna vishwa ke praani ravan ko is asahaay avasthaa main dekhen or unke man se uskaa bhay nikal jaye
 After this, Ravana accepted his defeat and extended the hand of friendship towards Vali, which Vali accepted
 maaya naamak asur stri ke do putr the — mayavi tathaa dundubhi
 Dundubhi was an Asura as Mahish
 pahaad se mahaan dundubhi ko apane bal par itnaa dambh ho gaya ki usne sagar raaj ko dwandv yuddh ke liye lalakaara
 Though Sagar Raj could finish his arrogance there, but he said that with such a hero he is unable to duel and asked Dundubhi to go to Himwan, the king of the Giris
 dundubhi himavan ke paas gaya to himavan ne bhi usase yuddh karne ke liye manaa kar diya tathaa usase indra ke putr wali ko lalkaarane kaa suzav diya jo ki kiskindha kaa raja tha
 Dundubhi then went to the door of Kishkindha and challenged Vali to a duel
 madamast wali ne pehle to dambhi dundubhi ko samajhane kii koshish kii parantu jab vah nahin mana to wali dwandv ke liye raji ho gaya or dundubhi ko badi saralata se haraakar uskaa vadh kar diya
 After this, Vali bounced off Dundubhi's lifeless body and threw away a plan in one stroke
 sharir se tapakati rakt kii boonden maharishi matang ke ashram main giriin jo ki rishyamook parvat main sthit tha
 The enraged Matang cursed the Vali that if the Vali ever came within the scope of a plan of his Ashram, he would die
 ramayana ke kiskindha kand main yah bhi ullekh aata he ke wali pratidin surya ko jal chadhaane purv tat se pashchim tat or uttar se dakshin taton main jaataa tha
 He used to throw the peaks of the mountains that came in the way and catch them again as if it were a ball
 iske pashchaat bhi jab vah surya vandana karke lautataa tha to use thakaavat nahin hoti thi
 It is said about Vali that if anyone challenged him for a duel, he would be ready immediately
 dundubhi ke bada bhai mayavi kii wali se kisi stri ko lekar badi puraani shatruta thi
 Mayavi came to Kishkindha one night and challenged Vali to a duel
 striyon tathaa shubhachintakon ke manaa karne ke baavjood wali us asur ke peeche bhaaga
 Sugriva was also with him
 bhaagate-bhaagate mayavi zamin ke neeche bani ek kandara main ghus gaya
 Vali also followed him
 jane se pehle usne sugriv ko yah aadesh diya ki jab tak vah mayavi kaa vadh kar lautakar nahin aata, tab tak sugriv us kandara ke muhane par khadaa hokar paharaa de
 After a gap of more than a year, blood came out from the mouth of the cane
 sugriv ne asur kii chitkaar to suni parantu wali kii nahin
 Realizing that his forehead was killed in the battle, Sugriva closed the mouth of that candra with a rock and returned to Kishkindha where he told the news to everyone
 mantriyon ne salaah kar sugriv kaa rajbhishek kar diya
 After some time, Vali appeared and was very angry when he saw his brother-in-law
 sugriv ne use samajhane kaa bharsak praytn kiya parantu wali ne uski ek na suni or sugriv ke rajya tathaa patni rumaa ko hadapkar use desh-nikaala de diya
 Due to fear, Sugriva took refuge in Mount Rishimuk where Vali could not go due to the curse
 yaheen sugriv kaa milaap hanuman ke kaaran ram se hua
 On Rama's assurance that Rama would kill the Vali himself, Sugriva challenged the Vali
 wali lalkaar sunakar baahar aayaa
 There was a fierce battle between the two, but because both brothers had the same face and body composition, Rama did not shoot his arrow due to confusion
 antat wali ne sugriv ko buree tarah parrast karke dur khaded diya
 Frustrated, Sugreev again came to Rama
 ram ne is baar lakshmana se sugriv ke gale main maala pehanaane ko kaha jisase vah dwandv ke dauraan sugriv ko pahchaanane main galati nahin karenge or sugriv se wali ko pun: lalkaarane ko kaha
 Desperate Sugriva again walked towards Kishkindha's gate to dare Vali
 jab wali ne dobaaraa sugriv kii lalkaar suni to uske krodh kaa thikaana na rahaa
 Tara might have realized that Sugriva enjoys Rama's patronage because Sugriva alone does not dare to dare him again
 atah kisi anhoni ke bhay se tara ne wali ko saavdhaan karne kii cheshtaa kii
 He even said that after declaring Sugriva as the crown prince of Kishkindha, he should make a treaty with him
 kintu wali ne is shaq se ki tara sugriv kaa anuchit paksh le rahi he, use dutkaar diya
 But he assured Tara that he would not kill Sugriva and would only teach him a good lesson
 donon bhaaiyon main phir se dwandv shuru hua lekin is baar ram ko donon bhaaiyon ko pahchaanane main koi galati nahin huyi or unhone wali par ped kii oot se baan chalaa diya
 The arrow pierced Vali's heart and he fell down to the ground
 dharti par gire maranasann wali ne ram se kai prashn kiye jinka saar is prakaar he:- In the Ramayana, Valmiki has tried to answer these questions as much as possible, but in the absence of any concrete answer, those who commented on the Ramayana have tried to justify the case in their own way
 ramayana ke bangla roopantaran krittivasi ramayana ke anusaar tara ram ko yah shaap detii he ki agle janm main ram wali ke haathon isi prakaar maare jaayenge kyonki shaayad is ramayana ke rachayita ko yah puraa prakaran hi tarkahin laga ho or is tarah is prakaran kaa samaadhaan kiya ho
 It is mentioned in the Mahanataka and the Ananda Ramayana that in the next life, Vali as the predator kills Krishna - who is the next incarnation of Vishnu - in the illusion of hunting

 Ramakrishna Paramahamsa was a great saint and thinker of India
 inhone sabhi dharmon kii ekta par jor diya
 Since childhood, he believed that one can have darshan of God, so to achieve God, he spent a life of hard work and devotion
 swami ramakrishna maanavtaa ke pujari the
 As a result of spiritual practice, he came to the conclusion that all the religions of the world are true and there is no difference among them
 ve ishwar tak pahunchne ke bhinn-bhinn saadhan maatr hai
 Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the saint of human values, was born on 18 February 1836 in Kamarpukur village in Bengal province
 inke bachapan kaa naam gadadhar tha
 Father's name was Khudiram and Mataji's name was Chandramanidevi
 unke bhakton ke anusaar ramakrishna ke mata pita ko unke janm se pehle hi alokik ghatnaon or drishyon kaa anubhav hua tha
 His father Khudiram had a dream in Gaya in which he saw that God Gadadhar told him that he would be born as his son
 unki mata chandramani devi ko bhi aisa ek anubhav hua tha unhone shiv mandir main apane garbh main roshni pravesh karte hue dekha
 Everyone was mesmerized by his childlike simplicity and enchanted smile
 saat varsh kii alpaayu main hi gadadhar ke sir se pita kaa saaya uth gaya
 Maintaining the whole family became difficult in such an adverse situation

 The courage of the boy Gadadhar did not diminish
 inke bade bhai ramkumar chattopadhyaay kalakatta main ek paathshaala ke sanchaalak the
 They took Gadadhar with them to Kolkata
 ramakrishna kaa antarman atyant nishchal, sahaj or vinayashil tha
 He was far from narrow

 Even after continuous efforts, Ramakrishna's mind could not be engaged in studies and teaching
 1855 main ramakrishna paramhans ke bade bhai ramkumar chattopadhyaay ko dakshineshwar kaali mandir ke mukhya pujari ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya tha
 Ramakrishna and his nephew Hridaya assisted Ramkumar
 ramakrishna ko devi pratimaa ko sajaane kaa daayitv diya gaya tha
 After the death of Ramkumar in 1856, Ramakrishna was ordained as a priest in the Kali temple
 ramkumar kii mrityu ke baad shri ramakrishna zyaada dhyaan magn rahane lage
 He began to see the idol of Kali Mata as his mother and the mother of the universe
 kaha jaataa hai kii shri ramakrishna ko kaali mata ke darshan bramhand kii mata ke rup main hua tha
 Ramakrishna describes it as saying, "the house, the gate, the temple and everything became invisible, as if there was nothing! And i saw the ocean of light without an infinite arrow, it was the ocean of consciousness
" jis disha main bhi maine dur dur tak jahaan bhi dekha bas ujjwal lehren dikhaai de rahi thi, jo ek ke baad ek ,meri taraf aa rahi thi
 Rumor had spread that Ramakrishna's mental balance had deteriorated due to spiritual practice in Dakshineswar
 ramakrishna kii mata or unke bade bhai rameshwar ramakrishna kaa vivaah karwaane kaa nirnay liya
 He believed that upon getting married, Gadadhar's mental balance would be corrected, due to the responsibilities that came after marriage, his focus would shift from spiritual practice
 ramakrishna ne khud unhen yah kaha ki ve unke liye kanya jayrambati main ramachandra mukherjee ke ghar paa sakate hai
 In 1859, 5-year-old Shardamani Mukhopadhyay and 23-year-old Ramakrishna were married
 vivaah ke baad sharada jayrambati main rahati thi or 18 varsh ke hone par ve ramakrishna ke paas dakshineshwar main rahane lagi
 Ramakrishna then lived the life of a monk
 kaalaantar main bade bhai bhi chal based
 He was distressed by this incident
 sansar kii anityata ko dekhakar unke man main vairaygy kaa udai hua
 Even without noticing from inside, Sri Ramakrishna started worshiping the temple and praying
 dakshineshwar sthit panchvati main ve dhyanamgn rahane lage
 He was distraught to see God
 log unhe pagal samajhane lage
 Worried over his son's frenzied state of mind, Chandramani Devi married Gadadhar to Sarada Devi
 iske baad bhairavi brahmani kaa dakshineshwar main aagaman hua
 He taught them Tantra
 madhubhav main avasthaan karte hue thakur ne shrikrishna kaa darshan kiya
 He gained the knowledge of Advaita Vedanta from Totapuri Maharaj and attained the state of life
 sanyas grahan karne ke vaad unka nayaa naam hua shriramkrishna paramhans
 After this, he also practiced Islam and Christianity

 Some great scholars and famous Vaishnavas and tantric seekers like Pt
 Narayana Shastri, Pt
 Padmalochan Tarakalakar, Vaishnavacharan and Gaurikant Tarakbhushan etc
 kept getting spiritual inspiration from him
 vah sheeghra hi tatkaaleen suvikhyath vichaarkon ke ghanishtha sampark main aae jo bengal main vichaaron kaa netritv kar rahe the
 Names of Keshavchandra Sen, Vijayakrishna Goswami, Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar can be named in these

 Swami Vivekananda was his supreme disciple
 ramakrishna paramhans jivan ke antim dinon main samadhi kii sthiti main rahane lage
 Therefore, the body started to relax
 shishyon dwaara swasthya par dhyaan dene kii prarthana par agyanta jaanakar hans dete the
 His disciples used to call him by the name of Thakur
 ramakrishna ke parampriy shishy vivekananda kuch samay himalay ke kisi ekaant sthaan par tapasya karnaa chaahate the
 When he went to the Guru to take this command, Ramakrishna said - Watts the people around us are suffering from hunger
 chaaron ore agyaan kaa andhera chaaya he
 People here keep on crying and shouting and you should be immersed in the joy of samadhi in a cave in the Himalayas
 kya tumhaari aatma sweekaaregi? isse vivekananda daridr narayan kii seva main lag gayi
 Ramakrishna was a great yogi, high-class seeker and thinker
 seva path ko ishwariya, prashast maanakar anekta main ekta kaa darshan karte the
 Wanted to protect society from service
 gale main sujan ko jab doctoron ne cancer bataakar samadhi lene or vaartalap se manaa kiya tab bhi ve muskaraaye
 Vivekananda kept on getting treatment even after stopping the treatment

 Finally that day of sorrow has come
 1886 i
 16 agast savera hone ke kuch hi vakt pehle anandaghan vigrah shriramkrishna is nashwar deh ko tyaag kar mahasamadhi dwaara swa-swarup main leen ho gayi
 Ramakrishna used to teach people through short stories
 kalakatta ke buddhijiviyon par unke vichaaron ne jabardast prabhaav choda tha ; halaki unki shikshaayen aadhuniktaa or raashtra ke azaadi ke bare main nahin thi
 His spiritual movement indirectly served to increase the feeling of nationalism in the country as his teachings negate casteism and religious bias
 ramakrishna ke anusaar hi manushya jivan kaa sabase bada lakshya hai
 Ramakrishna used to say that kamini-kanch is the biggest hindrance to attaining God
 ramakrishna sansar ko maaya ke rup main dekhte the
 According to him Avidya Maya represents the dark powers of creation, it puts human at the lower level of consciousness
 yah shaktiyaan manushya ko janm or mrityu ke chakra main bandhane ke liye zimmedaar hai
 The same Vidya Maya are responsible for the good powers of creation

 Unlicensed lime and calcium hydroxide derived from it are both important chemical compounds
 avaidh nijee laabh ke liye sarkari adhikariyon dwaara apane vidhaayi shaktiyon kaa upyog rajnatik bhrashtachar kehalaata he
 But in general, misuse of governmental powers does not count in political corruption
 bhrashtachar kii kai kismein or digriyan ho sakati hai, lekin samajha jaataa he ki raajnneetik or prashasnic bhrashtachar samaaj or vyavastha ko sabase zyaada prabhavit karata he
 If it is not restrained, corruption can become part of the psyche of the present and future generations
 maan liya jaataa he ki bhrashtachar upar se neeche tak sabhi ko, kisi ko kam to kisi ko zyaada, laabh pahunchaa rahaa he
 Political and administrative corruption do not separate from each other and thrive in mutual alliances
 2004 kii global karpshan report ke mutabik indonesia ke raashtrapati suhartho, philippines ke raashtrapati marcos, zaire ke raashtrapati mobuto seku, nigeria ke raashtrapati sani abaaka, sarbia ke raashtrapati milosevich, haiti ke raashtrapati duvelior or peru ke raashtrapati fugemori ne saikadon se lekar arabon dollar kii rakam kaa bhrashtachar kiya
 These corrupt leaders could not loot this government money without the help of bureaucracy
 khaas baat yah he ki is bhrashtachar main nijee kshetra or corporate poonji kii bhoomika bhi hoti he
 Without the nexus between market processes and decisions taken at top political-administrative fronts, this corruption cannot take such a large form
 azaadi ke baad bharat main bhi raajnneetik or prashasnic bhrashtachar kii yah parighatna tezi se panpi he
 On the one hand, it is suspected that illicit money of big politicians is deposited in the intelligence accounts of Swiss banks and on the other hand raids on the houses of IAS officers from third tier clerks have recovered crores of crores
 raajnneetik or prashasnic bhrashtachar ko thik se samajhane ke liye adhyetaon ne use do shreniyon main baanta he
 Corruption caused by misusing it while in government office and corruption to maintain political or administrative status
 pehali shrenee main nijee kshetra ko diye gayi thekon or licenson ke badale liya gaya kamishan, hathiyaaron kii kareed-bikri main liya gaya kamishan, farjivade or anya aarthik aparaadhon dwaara jamaa kii gayi rakam, tex-chori main madad or protsaahan se hasil kii gayi rakam, raajnneetik rutabe kaa istemaal karke dhan kii ugaahi, sarkari prabhaav kaa istemaal karke kisi company ko laabh pahunchaane or uske badale rakam vasuulne or faayde vaali niyuktiyon ke badale varisht naukarshahon or netaaon dwaara vasule jane vaale avaidh dhan jaisi gatividhiyaan pehali shrenee main aati hai
 In the second category, the amount of money raised in the name of party fund to contest elections, the action to buy voters, the money spent in buying mlas and mps to get the majority, Parliament-courts, government institutions, civil society To allocate resources and government resources to make decisions in favor of or get support from media organizations and media Has come favoritism going
 raajnneetik-prashasnic bhrashtachar ko samajhane ke liye zaruri he ki in donon shreniyon ke alaava ek or vibhedikaran kiya jaae
 This is big corruption at the top and small corruption at the bottom
 sujan rose ecreman ne apni rachana karpshan and government : cojiz, consequasins and riform main sheersh padon par hone vaale bhrashtachar ko ‘clayptocraisi’ kii sangya di gayi he
 a big politician or a big bureaucrat sitting at the top of any system can behave like a private monopoly capitalist
 haalaanki ecreman ne bharat ke udhaaharan par na ke baraabar hi gaur kiya he, par bharat main public sector sansthaaon ke mukhiya afasaron ko ‘sarkari mughalon’ kii sangya di ja chuki he
 The phenomenon of judicial corruption by judges is new in India but its effect is beginning to be seen
 dilli main hue rashtramandaleey khelon ke aayojan main hue bheeshan bhrashtachar ke peeche bhi netaaon or afasaron kaa sheersh khel hi tha
 Corruption in allocation of 2G spectrum can also be taken as a fresh example of kleptocracy
 nichle str par hone vaala bhrashtachar ‘speed mani’ yaa ‘suvidha shulk’ ke taur par janaa jaataa he
 Station-level police officers, sales tax or income tax officers, customs and excise officers and various types of inspectors benefit from such corruption
 isi tarah zila str par diye jane vaale thekon ke aabantan main puure zila prashasan main kamishan kii rakam kaa bantnaa ek aam baat he
 It is necessary to mention here the controversy related to the evaluation of both these types of corruption
 saarvajanik jivan main aksar yah bahes hoti rahati he ki clayptocraisi zyaada badi samasya he, yaa phir suvidha shulk? samaaj sheersh padon par hone vaale bhrashtachar se adhik prabhavit hota he, yaa nichle str par hone vaale apekshaakrit chote bhrashtachar se? is bahes ke peeche ek vimarsh he jo clayptocraisi se judaa hua he
 In the seventies and eighties, it was seen that at times the kleptocratic rulers or officers sitting at the top disliked the corruption at the bottom
 unhen lagata tha ki is chhutbhaiye bhrashtachar se vyavastha badnaam hoti he or avaidh laabh uthaane kii khud unki kshamta ghat jaati he
 In this view, lower level corruption was a sign of administrative inefficiency
 yah sahi he ki chote str kaa bhrashtachar rishwatakhori ko puure samaaj main vikendrit kar detaa he
 Ackerman has also identified this aspect in his composition
 bharat main iske saamaajik prabhaav kaa ek udhaaharan vivaah ke bazaar main laabh ke padon par baithe varon kii unchi dahej-daron ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 But the Indian example on the other hand suggests that this form of corruption not only links to commissioning, brokerage and extortion occurring at the top positions, but also watering each other
 pichley bees varshon se bhartiya loktantr main rajya sarkaron ke str par sattarudh nizaam dwaara aglaa chunaav ladane ke liye naukarshahi ke zariye niojit ugaahi karne kii praudyogiki lagbhag sthapit ho chuki he
 This process has substantially reduced the difference between kleptocracy and convenience fees
 bharat jaise sansadeey loktantr main chunaav ladane or usamen jeetne-haarane kii prakriya avaidh dhan ke istemaal or uske parinamswaroop bhrashtachar kaa pramukh strot bani hui he
 This problem was there even in the days of government control over the economy, but in the era of market oriented system, it has taken a more formidable shape than ever before 
 ek taraf chunaavon kii sankhya or baarambarataa bad rahi he, duusari taraf rajanetaaon ko chunaav ladane or partiyaan chalaane ke liye dhan kii zarurat
 Political parties receive massive intelligence grants from private sources, along with bureaucracy using fundraising
 yah kaala dhan hota he
 In return, the leaders promise to serve the same economic interests
 nijee poonji na keval un netaaon or raajnneetik partiyon kii aarthik madad karti he jinke satta main aane kii sambhaavna he, balki vah chaalaaki se haashiye par padi raajnneetik takaton ko bhi pataaye rakhana chaahati he taaki mauka aane par unka istemaal kar sake
 This aspect of political corruption has an even darker side
 ek taraf sangathit aparaadh jagat dwaara chunaav prakriya main dhan kaa nivesh or duusari taraf swayan maffia saradaaron dwaara partiyon ke ummidavaar ban kar chunaav jeetne kii koshish karnaa
 This aspect is also seen as criminalization of politics
 chunaav pranaaliyon kaa bhrashtachar kii samasya ke aaine main tulanaatmak adhyayan bhi kiya gaya he
 Several scholars have shown in a study that proportional representation is more prone to political corruption than first-past-the-post

 aksar votaron ke saamne ek taraf sattarudh bhrasht or duusari taraf vipaksh main baithe sandigdh charitra ke netaa ke bich chunaav karne kaa vikalp hota he
 a study has also shown by factual analysis that a framework in public life creates a framework that frees the political sector from corruption due to the lack of benefits from positions of profit, the weakness of the opposition and the nexus between the powers of capital

 But, what should be the index of transparency of public life in a country - it remains a matter of controversy

 Satguru or Sadguru means the true Guru
 This word is considered different from other forms of Guru such as Guru of musicology, Guru of teaching, Guru of parents etc

 saanchaa:jalwaayu kshetra Basic education is very important and valuable in the contribution of Mahatma Gandhi to India
 ise wardha yojana, nayi talim, 'buniyadi talim' tathaa 'basic shiksha' ke naamon se bhi janaa jaataa he
 Gandhiji planned a 'new training' on 23 October 1937, which was to be given a nationwide practical form
 unke shaikshik vichaar shikshashastriyon ke tatkaaleen vichaaron se mail nahin khate, isaliye prarambh main unke vichaaron kaa virodh hua
 Gandhiji said that the idea of the new training is his last and best contribution to India
 gandhiji ke jinav-paryant chale satya ke anveshan evam raashtra ke nirmaan hetu sakriy prayogon ke madhyam se lambe samay tak vichaaron ke gahan manthan ke parinamswaroop nayi talim kaa darshan evam prakriya kaa pradurbhaav hua jo keval bharatvarsh hi nahin, apitu sampoorn maanav samaaj ko ek nayi disha dene main sakasham tha
 But unfortunately this best welfare education system could not be used properly even at the national level, due to which till today this country was unable to achieve meaningful and right swaraj as per Gandhiji's dream
 balki iske vipareet aaj to alam yah he ki shaikshanik, saamaajik evam aarthik drushti se bharat punah paashchaatya samrajyavad ke adheen nirantar sarakta chalaa ja rahaa he
 Today, most of India's education system is dependent on the state or capitalists
 adhikansh rajashrith shikshan-sansthaayen sansaadhan evam anushaasan ke abhaav main niskriy hai
 Therefore, are unable to provide quality education
 isi prakaar poojipatiyon par ashrith sabhi shikshan-sansthaaen vyavsaayik rup main sakriy hai, jo garibon kii pahunch se baahar hai
 Only children of rich people can study in them

 Those who have the ability to go to school do not receive anything other than the tradition of English education from Lord Macaulay
 kul milakar unamem bhartiya moulik shiksha ko grahan karanevaale shaayad hi koi mili
 It is not that there is a lack of Indian teachers
 parantu isliye ki sabhi abhibhavakon main yah ichhashakti evam saahas nahin he ki apane bacchon ko sarkaron athwa puunjipatiyon dwaara nirdhaarit angreji shiksha ko tyagkar bhartiya shiksha dilaawein
 Till this cowardly mentality of the general public will not be changed, no Indian educational system including new training can flourish in this country
 22–23 oktober, 1937 ko wardha main jo 'akhil bhartiya shaikshik sammelan' yojit hua, uski adhyakshata gandhiji ne kii
 In his inaugural address, Gandhiji highlighted important aspects of his teaching
 uske baad unki 'nai talim' yojana ke anek pahaluon par khuli charchaa hui
 Many scholars including the famous Gandhian educationist Vinoba Bhave, Kaka Kalelkar and Zakir Hussain participated in this discussion
 sammelan ke antim din nimnlikhit prastaav paarit kiye gayi- After these proposals were passed, a committee of experts was formed under the chairmanship of Dr
 Zakir Hussain, who was given the task of preparing practical courses based on these proposals
 in prastaavon ke aadhaar par ek rashtriya shaikshik yojana taiyaar kii gayi jo desh bhar main 'nai talim', 'buniyadi shiksha' yaa 'wardha yojana' ke naam se prasiddh hui
 As a result of the declaration of the Government of India Act of 1935, when the Congress governments in seven provinces of British India formulated a program for national reconstruction, basic education was also a cornerstone in its fourteen pillars
 gandhi ji buniyadi shiksha ko saamaajik parivartan kaa ek saadhan samajhate the
 They considered it to be a major basis of a quiet social revolution
 ve vyakti ke shaareerik, maansik tathaa aadhyatmik pakshon ke punarnirmaan dwaara saamaajik kranti kaa ek pramukh aadhaar maanate the
 They wanted to bring about a social revolution by rebuilding the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of the person
 aatmavishvaas evam aatmanirbharta ko hi unhone manushya ke purna vikaas kaa aadhaar mana
 He considered education as the birthright of every person
 isiliye unhone saat se chaudaa varshavaale varg ke sabhi baalkon evam balikaon ko ni:shulk evam anivaary shiksha dena aavashyak samajha
 After the acceptance of the Basic National Education Scheme at the Haripur session of the Indian National Congress, since 1938, many experiments in basic education started but they were done at different and limited levels
 san 1939 i
 main dwitiya mahayuddh ke chhid jane se ek or kathinaayee upasthit ho gai
 The Congress cabinet had to resign due to political reasons
 unase yah aashaa kii jaati thi ki ve buniyadi shiksha ke vikaas main sahaayak honge
 But as a result of his resignation, experiments were stopped altogether in some provinces and indifference to experimentation began to appear in other provinces
 swatantraprapti ke baad hi buniyadi shiksha ko shiksha kii rashtriya paddati ke rup main gambhirthapurvak sweekaar kiya gaya
 Basic education continued to progress as the number of basic schools continued to grow
 kintu saadhaaran praarambhik or middle skulon kii apeksha basic skulon kii sankhya kii vruddhi kii gati main kami rahi he
 The status of admission to basic schools has not been satisfactory
 lakshya to yah tha ki basic shiksha main 6 se 14 varsh ke vargvaale sabhi ladakon evam ladakiyon ke liye buniyadi shiksha kaa prabandh kiya jaae
 But no significant progress was made in the first two schemes in this education
 is kaal main buniyadi shiksha ke prasar kii pragati utani bhi nahin hui jitani saadhaaran praarambhik shiksha ke prasar kii, yadhyapi saadhaaran praarambhik shiksha kii pragati bhi santoshjanak nahin he
 The condition of teacher teaching is also not satisfactory at all
 bharat main praarambhik shikshakon kii shiksha ke bare main pratham rashtriya vichaargoshtee kii 1960 i
 kii report or haal main adhyaaapak prashikshan ke sambandh main plan projects kii samiti kii 1963 i
 kii report se siddh hota he ki adhyaaapak prashikshan kaarykram main anek trutiyaan hai
 It has not only lacked proper and qualified staff, buildings, equipment and other macro resources but has also been blamed for inadequate curriculum and ineffective method and style of teaching
 buniyadi shiksha kii koi spasht paribhaasha nahin he jisase log saadharantaya sahamat hon
 There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding the basic fundamentals and definite goals of basic education
 gandhi ji ne buniyadi shiksha ke siddhanton ko pratipaadit karte samay ek nishchit saamaajik vyavastha kii kalpana kii thi
 He considered productive work as the center of education, but in actual use, the principle of education by productive work has different meanings
 kuch shikshavid, jo gandhi ji ke anuyaayi hone kaa daawa karte hai, vidyalayon main prayog yogya vastuon ke vaastavik utpaadan par jor dete hai
 Some people believe that this means nothing but education through sports law
 buniyadi shiksha main aatmanirbharta kaa prashn or bhi vivadpurn he
 Gandhiji considered self-reliance as the real criteria of education
 aatmanirbharta se unka taatpary yah tha ki basic skool is seemaa tak swaavlambee ho jaaen ki adhyapakon kaa vetan vidyalayon main bacchon dwaara utpaadit vastuon ko bechakar diya ja sake
 Therefore, initially a very large section of the supporters of basic education started to hope that if a proper environment is created for basic education, then the expenditure on it will be expended and the government will pay the remaining expenses so that basic schools can run efficiently
 kintu anubhav se yah anumaan galat siddh hua
 The pires-lakhani Committee appointed by the Ministry of Education, Government of India, studied this problem and stated that no school was more than 41
09 percent self-supporting in 1950–1951 in Bihar, which was considered to be the primary state of basic education
 sewagram kaa basic skool, jo hindustani talimi sangh ke pathpradarshan evam nirikshan main chal rahaa tha, 63 pratishat tak swaavlambee tha
 Isanan had the distinction of getting first place in the list of basic schools in this direction
 san 1949-1950 main bihar pradesh ke 100 basic skool, jinamein 18 senior basic skool bhi the, keval 15 pratishat hi swaavlambee ho sake
 Since then, in general, there is no change in the situation towards goodness
 bharat sarkaar dwaara buniyadi shiksha ke liye pratham panchavarshiya yojana ke ant main jo moolyankan samiti niyukt hui thi vah bhi isi nishkarshan par pahaunchi
 The Government of India did not even mention self-reliance in the booklet titled 'concept of Basic Education'
 yahan tak ki gandhivaad ke aadarshon ke mahan poshak vinoba bhaave kaa bhi ab yah vichaar ho gaya he ki bacchon dwaara utpaadit vastuon ke vikray kaa laabh shiksha par honevaale uchit kharch ke kam karne par prayog na kiya jaae balki vah abhibhavakon ko milanaa chahie jisase ve apane kaam main apane bacchon kii sahaayta se laabh na uthaa sakane ke kaaran hui kshati ko puraa kar saken
 It seems that the government, in principle, accepts that the profits derived from the productive work of children should be spent in their own interest, such as managing school clothes or mid-day meals
 isliye yah nishkarsh to nikaala hi ja saktaa he ki gandhi ji kii kalpana ke anusaar basic skulon main utpaadak vyavsaayon ko aarambh kar dene se buniyadi shiksha kaa kharch badi maatra main kam nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Therefore, if basic education is to be made a universal method of elementary education across the country, then for this, an economically abundant economy is necessary
 buniyadi shiksha ko saarvbhaum banane ke prashn ko yatharth ke str par sochna chahie
 India has pledged to establish a society with socialist ideals
 aise samaaz kii anivaary baton main se ek yah he ki iske sabhi sadsy sushikshit hon taaki ve saamaanya hit ke liye adhik se adhik yogadan kar saken or apane sammilit praytn kaa jo fal ho usase uchit rup se laabh uthaa saken
 Therefore, universal, free and compulsory education should be the first to be managed within the shortest possible time
 samvidhan kii 45 veen dhara ke anusaar 1960 i
 tak 14 varsh kii avasthaavale sabhi bacchon kii ni:shulk evam anivaary shiksha kaa rajya kii ore se prabandh ho janaa chahie tha
 This is a huge problem and great solutions, both human and physical, are needed to solve it
 yah anumaan he ki yadi desh apni rashtriya aay kaa do pratishat keval praarambhik shiksha par kharch kare to aavashyak saadhan itani maatra main praapt kiye ja sakate he ki chad se 14 varshavaale varg ke sabhi bacchon ko shiksha kii suvidhaayen 1980-1981 tak praapt ho jaaen
 Now, if basic education is given to all children, it will take much longer to reach the level of universal education
 buniyadi shiksha ucch koti kii hone ke kaaran adhik mahangi he
 It is clear from the recommendations of the Auxiliary Committee appointed by the National Committee on Basic Education that the development of elementary education as well as basic education, keeping in view the minimum means required to convert an ordinary elementary school into a basic school Seems necessary
 aavashyaktaa is baat kii he ki ek doordarshee yojana banaai jaae jiske anusaar buniyadi shiksha kaa vistaar baraabar hota rahe taaki ant main yah rashtriya str par praarambhik shiksha kii sudhari hui paddati ke rup main viksit ho jaae
 Some things that need to be done are proposed below: paramparaagat siddhanton par hi kaam kar rahe basic skulon ko kam se kam anivaary sharton kii purti karte hue sachche basic skool bananaa chahie
 The schools which have not been fully developed should be given maximum help so that they become ideal basic schools and others should follow them
 buniyadi shiksha ke vistaar ko lagaataar badhaate rahen
 Convert ordinary schools to basic schools and open new basic schools
 adhikansh pradesh basic skulon kii sankhya ko prativarsh kam se kam 5 pratishat to badha ho sakate hai
 While choosing industries for basic schools, it should be kept in mind that the industries should be prosperous in terms of education and adapt to the social environment and condition of children
 kachche maal kii barabaadi ko rokane ke liye basic skulon kii nimna shreniyon main udyog sambandhi kaary us samay tak na karaayaa jaae jab tak bachche itane paripakv na ho jaaen ki ve iskaa prayog laabhpurvak kar saken
 Soil work, elementary gardening or some low-cost hand work can be done in the lower classes
 buniyadi shiksha ke paathyakram main is aadhaar par parivartan karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 Some elements of basic education can be easily adopted in all elementary schools, such as health-related activities, social service programs, cultural activities, etc
 aisa vidhyalay, jiske paas paryaapt maatra main bhoomi ho or sinchai kii suvidhaayen paryaapt hon, fal or tarkariyon ke utpaadan kaa kaary kar saktaa he
 It is necessary that the schools in which these activities are started should be properly planned and at the same time, full educational benefit should be taken from them
 uttar buniyadi vidhyalay ko bahuddeshiy ucchtar madhyamik vidhyalay kii ek shakha samajhnaa chahie jahaan us udyog main yogyata praapt karne par bal diya jaae jise ek chaatr basic skool se karata chalaa aayaa he
 In 1957, the Central Advisory Board of Education, on the opinion of the committee appointed by the Union Ministry of Education for detailed study in this matter, insisted that basic basic education should remain a part of the prevailing secondary education system of the country
 basic skool kii shaikshik yojana ko sucharu rup se chalaane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki adhyapakon kii shaikshik prishthbhumi ucch koti kii ho or ve apane kaary main praveen hon
 All the training institutions that prepare teachers for elementary schools should be of basic style
 prayek pradesh ke prayek jile main ek adarsh prashikshan vidhyalay sthapit kiya jaae
 Four to five basic schools should be attached to this training school
 is centre main paryaapt rup se adhyaaapak evam upkaran hon or buniyadi shiksha kaa sampurna kaarykram isi ke dwaara puraa kiya jaae
 It should be an integral part of a multi-disciplinary college of training which has many training institutes to prepare teachers for all levels of education and different branches of the school program
 1938 main buniyadi shiksha kii moulik yojana jakir hossain samiti ne taiyaar kii thi
 In it, it was recommended that a committee of education should be set up in every province whose functions should also include the work of search and organization in basic education
 prayek pradesh main sthapit shiksha kii pradeshy sanstha buniyadi shiksha kii vividh samasyaon kaa adhyayan tathaa anusandhan kaary kare
 The National Council of Educational Research and Training should research problems of national importance
 anusandhan dwaara samavaay paddati ko adhyaaapak ke liye subodh tathaa sugam bana diya jaae
 There are some main problems related to basic education that need immediate attention to solve, such as the problem of teaching multiple classes by the same teacher, the problem of teaching classes in which the number of children is very large, of different industries
 To explore the educational possibilities and develop their method and production capacity by which to check how far weaving The progress of Hindi education is being made according to its objectives so that the teachers and administrators of basic education can benefit from these methods and tools as needed, to pay attention to the problems of training institutions preparing teachers for basic schools so as to make the training program effective
 And to pay attention to the preparation of appropriate literature for the students

 The first guerilla war was fought 360 years ago in China by Emperor Huang against his enemy Si Yao
 isamen si yaao haar gaya
 The guerrilla war is described in the history of England
 kerectakar ne dakshini wales ke garh se chhapamar yuddh main roman sena ko pareshaan kiya tha
 Guerilla warfare in India became more frequent in the late 17th century and early 18th century
 marahathon ke in chhapamar yudhon ne shaktishaalee mughal sena kaa aatmavi·sa nasht kar diya
 The warlords named Shantaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav have engulfed the whole country with their wandering squads
 jab mughal sena akraman kii aashaa nahin karti thi, us samay akraman karke unhone pramukh mughal saradaaron ko vismit or parajeet kiya
 The successful guerrilla warfare tactics of the Marathas destroyed the means of the Mughal army and destroyed their discipline and zeal so much that Aurangzeb had to call his best army back to Ahmednagar in 1706 AD and Aurangzeb died the following year
 chhapamar marathe apane drudh tattuon par savaar hokar chaaron ore fail jate, pradaay roak lete, angrakshakon ke kaary main baadha daalate or aise sthaan par pahunchakar, jahaan unke pahunchne kii sabase kam aashaa hoti, luutmaar karte or saare pradesh ko aakraant kar dete
 This strategy broke the back of the Mughals, destroyed their means, due to their quickness, the Mughal army could not capture them
 isi liye spain ke chhapamaron ne prayadwipiya yuddh main or rus ke aniyamit sainikon ne masco ke yuddh main napolian kii naak main, dam kar diya
 Colonel John S

 Till now wars were fought by the states
 kintu ab yah rashtriya vishay ban gaya or naagarik bhi vyaktigat rup se isamen sammilit ho gaye
 The principle of guerrilla soldiers is - 'kill and flee'
 ye sahasaa akraman karte hai, adrishy ho jate hai or thodi dur par hi prakat ho jate hai
 They keep very few items with them
 inke liye koi niyantrankarta bhi nahin rahata, at: inaki kriyasheeltaa main baadha nahin padati
 The guerrilla army usually defends itself by having a strong army attack them
 unhen apni buddhi vishesh vi·sa rahata he
 For their safety, they keep a system of information providers
 chhapamar yuddh kaa uddeshy he shatru kii niyamit sena kaa prabhaav ghataana
 In order to fulfill this objective well, they work behind the enemy
 saath hi bade paimaane par kiye janevaale niyamit sena ke kaaryon main bhi sahaayta pahunchaate hai
 The soldiers of the guerrillas do not remain soldiers
 ve rail, yatayaat, rasad, pul or isi ke anya sadhano ko bhi kshati pahunchaate hai, jo shatruon kii niyamit sena kaaryon main baadha daal saken
 There are three main items for the partisan wars
 pehali chhapamar ke kaary ke liye upyukt bhubhag, duusari raajnneetik avasthaa or teen vastu he rashtriya paristhitiyaan
 The most suitable for this type of work is the hilly land, which has a forest, or a similar plot full of forests and marshes
 chhapamar yuddh se raksha ke liye chhapamaron dwaara prayukt aniyamit vidhiyon kaa gyaan aavashyak he jisase sahakaari prayatnon dwaara unke prayatnon ko turant nasht kar diya jaay
 Another particularly useful method is to surround the area in which the guerrillas rest
 pratham vishwayuddh main europe main lambey morache lagate the
 This area is not particularly attractive for the partisans, but the Arab revolt of 1916-18 was quite irregular

 larens ne arab kii sena ke sahyog se chhapamari ke jo kaary kiye ve ullekhneey hai
 The rhetoric of the Middle East had two weaknesses, first, the unrest between the people or the Arabs, and the second, the fractious and weak communication system governing the Ottoman Empire
 larens or unke sahaayak arabon ne turk gadhon se bachate hue rail kii line kaat deen, akramanon se turkon ko pareshaan kiya or unhen aage badhane se roak diya
 Now from the other side, the regular English forces stationed in Jordan attacked the main Ottoman army
 idhar larens ne apni sena kii sahaayta se is turki sena kaa anya senaaon se sambandh viched kar diya
 The reasons for Lawrence's success were the mobility of his army, external aid, time and public opinion, which helped the civilians
 is prakaar chhapamaron ko vijay mili
 a classic example of a partisan war was seen before the start of the Second World War
 japaniyon ne chiniyon par akraman kar diya
 In 1937 AD, Chinese forces evacuated the cities and retreated themselves
 china ke logon ko america se shastr or gola barood mila
 With the help of which they harassed the enemy army for a long time and separated the small troops from the main army and destroyed it

 The conquest of the Germans in Europe and the Japanese in south-east Asia took place so quickly and over a wide area that there was no good governance in the conquered territories
 sainikon ne jaise hi ek sthaan par vijay pai, unhen sahasaa aage bad jane kii ajna mili
 The conquered territories had to be left to the right of small military parties
 chhapamari ke liye ye kshetra adarsh sthal ban gaye or sheeghra hi shatru dalon ke bikhare hue sanchaar kshetron ko safaltaapurvak nasht kar diya gaya
 In North Africa, Italian forces initially occupied large areas and severely crushed the inhabitants there
 yahan kaa janamat italy ke vipareet ho gaya
 The British took advantage of this sentiment and successfully assisted guerrilla wars with the help of the indigenous people

 In the spring of 1941, the Germans annexed Yugoslavia
 desh ke adhikrut hone ke pashchaat hi josip vrozovik kii adhyakshata main vahaan ke logon ne ek chhapamar dal banaaya jo shatru sena ke viruddh kaary karata tha
 The need of arms was met by the people there, or the weapons snatched from the enemy
 germany or italy kii sainik tukadiyon ore unke addon par akraman karke inhone yuddh kaa saamaan praapt kiya
 Their number also increased with success
 san 1943 i

 This power spread throughout Yugoslavia and was especially situated in forests and mountains
 sanchaar vyavastha, jahaan tak sambhav ho saktaa tha, shatru dal se chhine gaye radio seton se chalati thi
 The objective of this group of Yugoslavia was to attack the enemy's accomplished targets that were weak and where the least expected attack occurred
 iske atirikt kisi bhi avasthaa main ve aisa avasar nahin dena chaahate the ki shatru unpar pratyakraman kar saken
 Tito's advocates depended on citizens for supplies, shelter and information
 sabhi chhapamar yudhon main nagarikon kaa vyavhaar atyant mahatv kaa hota he
 They were punished for the assistance the citizens had provided to the guerrillas
 sahastron purush, striyaan or bachche maut ke ghat utaar die gaye
 Thousands of villages were looted and burnt down

 Yugoslavia is a proof of what results can be achieved with the cooperation of the modern air force and the guerrillas
 roosiyon kii safalataa main shatrudal kii sanchaar vyavastha par chhapamaron ke akraman kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 By relating to the public, they got a great means of getting information about the bases of the Germans and the activity of their army
 unki gatishiltaa, sthanon kaa gyaan, apratyaashit akraman or yudhakshetra se alag alag tukadiyon kaa alag alag waapas hona shatrudal ko bhram main daalane or pareshaan karne ke saadhan bane
 In 1941, Japan declared war
 isse england or sanyukt raashtra donon ke saamne badi badi samasyaayen aa garin
 The battlefield now became very wide and in the first stage of the war it became impossible to manage the items needed for such a long defense line
 philippine main niyukt sanyuktaraashtra ke general duglas macarthar us kshetra main kai varsh rah chuke the
 They arranged a guerrilla army against the Japanese
 unhone adhikariyon ke kai chote chote dal is tapu main bikher die
 These officers were well acquainted with this area
 inkaa kaam japani sena se bachakar chhapamari karnaa tha
 There were a maximum of 15 persons in each team, including people skilled in technical communication etc
 inkaa mukhya kaary gupt samachar praapt karnaa or unhen preshit karnaa tha
 Their second task was to obstruct Japanese control established in the country
 in dalon ke fail jane ke baad dalon main parsparik sanchaar kii vyavastha main kathinaayee hone lagi
 To overcome this difficulty, the guerrillas used small radio sets of the public
 baad main san 1942 i
 main general macarthar ke austrailia sthit mukhya karyaalay se chhapamar tukadiyon kaa sidhaa radiyon sambandh sthapit ho gaya
 Soon there was a regular arrangement for sending submarines, and by April 1944 all major islands had established radio contact with General macarthur
 sheeghra hi vibhinn dwipon par senaayen utaarne kii yojana bani
 The task of the guerrillas was to obtain secret information and to find targets for the United Nations Army
 is prakaar chhapamaron ke dwaara kiye gaye jasusi ke kaaryo se general macarthar ko is kshetra ko punarjaagrath karne or apane kaaryon kii yojana banane main mahatvapurn sahaayta mili
 In February 1943, General Aiden C
 Winget, by mules and oxen, crossed the Chindbin and Irawadi rivers with 3,000 soldiers, reaching the backdrop of the Japanese forces stationed in Burma
 yahan inhone japani sanchaar vyavastha bigaadi, shastron ke bhandar nasht kar die or japaniyon dwaara bharat par honevaale akraman main baadha daali
 Radio sets were given by airplanes to their inner-most parties, known as Chindwin
 isi varsh angrejon ne burma main kechin jati ko chhapamari ke liye sanyojit kiya
 He was trained to use radio sets
 ye log shatrusena ke peeche adhik samay tak tik saken iske liye us kshetra main sahaytaprad vaataavaran kii bhi sristi kii gai
 After the second revolt, Asian countries like Malaya, India, etc
 also became good areas for raiding

 main korea main jo sangharsh vyapak ho gaya usamen atyant aadhunik shastron se sajjit niyamit sena ke viruddh chhapamari atyant prabhaavshaalee siddh hui
 Here communist guerrillas were taught to protect themselves from their superior powers
 choti tukadiyon dwaara shighratapurna akraman karne teji ke saath peeche hatane, teetar bitar ho jane or pun: ekatra hone par vishesh bal diya gaya
 The main parts of raids were direct attack and covert attack

 Between 50 and 300 people lived in the aggressive parties

 The first contingent would reach the offensive zone and disperse after completing its task
 duusari tukdi ke palaayan ke samay pehali tukdi uski raksha karti
 Returning would always be by some other route, crossing the mountains or a big river
 yuddh or prachaar ke hetu shatru paksh ko pareshaan bhi kiya jaataa tha, jisase shatrusena kaa naitik patan ho jaay
 It has been proved that the principles of guerilla warfare are the same today as in the early times of war
 aaj bhi chhapamar teevr gati se chalate hai, dhokhaa dekar shatrudal par vahaan akraman karte hai jahaan vah sabase adhik durbal hota he
 Also, they do not give the enemy an opportunity to retaliate
 yuddh main prayukt honevaale shastron, saaj saamaanon, sainik sthapanon aadi vyavasthaaon kii bhedyata ke saath saath hi, jinaki sahaayta se shighratapurvak akraman yaa antadhrvans sambhav he, chhapamaron kaa kshetra bhi badhata ja rahaa he
 Also, the importance of this type of war has increased in modern warfare
 sunirdhaarit lakshya or yudhkaushal kii paramaavashyak shrunkhalaaon ke vinaash dwaara shatru ke akraman kii sari yojanaon ko vifal banaaya ja saktaa he
 Geographical conditions also hold their special importance and a convenient field is very important for raiding
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main morachon ke sheeghra badhane ke falswaroop chhapamaron ke shatrusena main pravesh kii sambhaavnaayen bad garin or kahin kahin to niyamit sena kii tukadiyaan tak shatrudal ke prishthbhag par pahunch gai
 Now, the field of guerrilla work that can be done with the cooperation of guerrillas and citizens has become very vast
 is prakaar ke yudhon main janata kii sahaayta or shubhechha praapt karnaa anivaary ban gaya he
 These two inventions, radio and aircraft, revolutionized the partisan war
 jahaan chhapamaron ko in sadhano se sahaayta praapt karne kaa maarg khulaa vahaan ye upkaran unka peechha karne ke kaam bhi aane lage
 Nevertheless, there was more profit than loss
 pehle chhapamaron ko apane saathiyon ke samachar kabhi kabhi hi mil pate the, kintu ab laghu vahneey preshkon kii sahaayta se unhen icchaanusaar apane saathiyon se sampark sthapit karne kii suvidha mil gai
 Then the task of unloading, taking them, strengthening their power and making them available for supply and other items of strategic importance also took place by aircrafts, raids and all other irregular armies
 chhapamaron kaa pramukh kaary he shatrusena ko unke prishthbhag se milane vaali saamagree kaa vinaash karnaa
 The strategic policy will change in view of the development of nuclear weapons
 senaayen choti choti tukadiyon main vibhajit hongi
 Decentralization of supply sources, war bases, industries and other strategic systems will be necessary
 falswaroop, yadi aanvik shakti kaa prayog hua, to chhapamaron ke lakshya aakaar main chote or sangrakshan adhik ho jaayange
 The result will be that the area of raiding will become larger and more effective
 niyamit sena bhi choti choti tukadiyon main yuddh karegi
 Under these circumstances, only partisan wars will be successful
 yah kahana anuchit na hoga ki yuddh main aanvik shastron kaa prayog hone par keval chhapamar yuddh hi pramukh mahatv kaa hoga or anya vidhiyon kaa saadhaaran upyog hi rah jaayga

 Gonorrhea is caused by a bacterium named Neisseria ganorrhea which grows easily and rapidly in the hot and wet areas of the reproductive tract in women and men
 iske jeevanu munh, galaa, aankh tathaa guda main bhi badhate hai
 Like syphilis, it is also an infectious disease, so it is the same men and women who have sexual contact with the person suffering from this disease
 sujak rog main chunki lingendriya ke andar ghaav ho jaataa he or isse pas nikalataa he atah ise hindi main 'pusmeh ', aupsargik pusmeh or ' parama ' kehete hai or angreji bhashaa main gonoria kehete hai
 pashchimi deshon main ise clep ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he
 The primary means of infection is sexual contact; During pregnancy or birth, this disease can be transmitted from mother to child or even in the womb, due to which natural syphilis occurs

 Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics, especially the preferred intramuscular penicillin g or ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline or azithromycin for people with severe penicillin allergy
 mana jaataa he ki sujak ne 1999 main puri duniya main 12 million logon ko prabhavit kiya, jisamen se 90% se adhik maamle vikasshil duniya ke hai
 After decreasing dramatically due to the wide availability of penicillin in 1940, the rate of infection has increased in many countries since the beginning of the century, often seen with human immunodeficiency virus

 Other symptoms may include fever, sore throat, restlessness, weight loss, loss of hair, and headache
 durlabh abhivyaktiyon main hepititis, kidney rog, gathiya, periostitis, optic neuritis, yuvatis or intertastiel kerietitisshamil ho sakate hai
 Severe symptoms usually appear after three to six weeks; However, secondary symptoms may recur in about 25% of people
 dwitiyak lakshanon vaale bahut saare log praathmik sifalis ke vishisht vran pehle na hone ko report karte hai
 Latent syphilis is defined by serologic evidence of infection without symptoms of the disease
 america main ise sheeghra yaa vilambit ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 The United Kingdom uses a two-year cut-off for early and delayed latent syphilis
 sheeghra avyakt sifalis main lakshanon kaa patan ho saktaa he
 Delayed latent syphilis is asymptomatic and not as contagious as early latent syphilis
 tritiyak sifalis aarambhik sankraman ke 3 se 15 varshon ke baad ho saktaa he or isko teen vibhinn roopon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: gumatius sifalis, vilambit neurosifalis or cardeovscular sifalis 
 a third of infected people develop tertiary syphilis without treatment
 tritiyak sifalis se peedit log sankramak nahin hote hai
 Gummatous syphilis or delayed benign syphilis usually occurs 1 to 46 years after the initial infection, with an average duration of 15 years
 is charan ko puraane gumaa se pahachaanaa jaataa he jo ki mulaayam, tumor jaise foole huye gendaakaar ubhaar hote hai or jinka aakaar bhinn-bhinn hota he
 They usually affect the skin, bone and liver and can occur anywhere
 neurosifalis ek aisa sankraman he jo kendriya tantrika tantrase sambandhit he
 It may occur early and be delayed as uncomplicated or syphilis meningitis, or as meningovascular syphilis, general paralysis, or tabes dorsalis, which is associated with glaring pain and poor balance in the lower organs
 vilambit neurosifalis aam taur se, sankraman ke 4 se 25 varshon ke baad hota he
 Meningovascular syphilis usually includes apathy and seizures and general muscle paralysis including dementia and tabes dorsalis
 saath hi, agril robertson pupil, ho sakate hai jo dwipaksheeya chote pupil hote hai jo tab jakadte hai jab vyakti najdiki vastu par dhyaan kendrit karata he lekin tab nahin jakadte hai jab chamkile prakaash se saamana hota he
 Cardiovascular syphilis usually occurs 10–30 years after infection

 In this way it can be infected by kissing near a wound, orally, vaginally, or by anal sex
 praathmik yaa dwitiyak sifalis se sankramit lagbhag 30 se 60% logon main rog punap saktaa he
 Its infectiousness can be understood by the example that a person who is protected from 57 organisms also has a 50% chance of getting infected
 america ke adhiktar naye maamle na purushon ke hai jo samalangik hai
 It can be transmitted by blood products
 halanki, bahut se deshon main iske liye rakt kii jaanch hoti he is kaaran iskaa jokhim kam he
 The risk of transmission from shared needles appears limited
 sifalis, toilat seat ke dwaara, dainik gatividhiyon, hot tub, bartanon yaa kapadon ko saajha karne se sancharit nahin ho saktaa he
 The clinical diagnosis of syphilis in its initial appearance is difficult
 pushti yaa torakt pareekshan yaa microscopy kaa upyog karte huye pratyaksh rup se dekh kar kii jaati he
 Blood tests are more commonly used because they are easier to perform
 halanki naidanik pareekshan rog ke charnon ke bich pahchaan karne main aksham hote hai
 Blood tests are called nontraponemal and treponeman tests
 nontraponmal pareekshan aarambhik rup se upyog kiye jate hai or inamen yon rog shodh prayogshaala or rapid plazmaa riagin pareekshan shaamil hai
 However, since these tests are sometimes erroneously positive, confirmation is required by treponemal tests such as treponemal pallidum particle agglutination or fluorescent treponemal antibody aberration test
 Erroneous positive results on nontraponemal tests can be caused by some viral infections such as varicella and smallpox, as well as lymphoma, tuberculosis, malaria, endocarditis, connective tissue disease, and pregnancy
 traponemal antibody aam taur par aarambhik sankraman ke baad do se paanch saptahon main sakaaratmak ho jate hai
 Neurosyphilis is diagnosed by an increased number of leukocytes and higher protein levels in the cerebrospine fluid in the setting of known syphilis infection 
 ek vran se seras taralki dark ground microscopy ko tatkaal nidaan ke liye upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Although hospitals do not always have equipment or experienced personnel, the test must be done within 10 minutes of the sample being taken
 lagbhag 90 % logon main samvedansheeltaa dekhi gayi he is prakaar ise keval kisi nidaan kii pushti ke liye upyog kiya ja saktaa he lekin isko baahar nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Two other tests can be performed on a sample of ulcers: a direct fluorescent antibody test and a nucleic acid amplification test
 diarect fluoroscent pareekshan fluorescine se jude antibodies kaa upyog karte huye kiye jate hai jo vishisht sifalis protein se jude hote hai, jabaki neucleic acid emplification vishisht sphalis jeenon kii upasthiti kii jaanch ke liye polimress chen riektionjaisi takneekon kaa upyog karata he
 These tests are not time-sensitive, as they do not require living bacteria for diagnosis
 saanchaa:abhi, tak rokthaam ke liye koi tikaa uplabdh nahin he
 Avoiding intimate physical contact with an infected person is effective in reducing the transmission of syphilis, as well as the use of latex condoms
 condom kaa upyog halanki jokhim ko puri tarah se samaapt nahin karata he
 Thus the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner and avoidance of substances such as alcohol and other drugs that promote risky sexual behavior
 navjaat main janmajaat sifaliff kii rokthaam, maataaon ko unke garbhadhaaran ke shuruaati samay main jaanch karke tathaa sankramit maataaon ke upachaar dwaara kii ja sakati he
 The United States Preventive Services Task Force strongly recommends that all pregnant women be universally examined, while the World Health Organization recommends that all women be examined at the time of their first antenatal visit and again in the third trimester Time
 yadi ve sakaaratmak hai to unke partner kaa bhi upachaar kiya janaa chaiye
 Congenital syphilis is still common in the progressive world because many women do not receive antenatal care at all, and even those who receive this care do not include screening, and this is sometimes the case in developed countries as well
 People with syphilis are less likely to receive care during pregnancy
 kam tathaa madhya aay deshon main jaanch tak pahunch banane ke kai upaay karne se janmajaat sifalis hone kii dar main prabhavi kami aati he
 Syphilis is a noticeable disease in many countries, including Canada, the European Union, and the United States
 iskaa arth he ki swasthya seva pradaataaon ko saarvajanik swasthdhikariyon ko suchit karne kii jarurat he, jo ki adarsh rup main us vyakti ke partner ko partner soochna pradaan karenge
 Doctors can encourage patients to send their partner for care
 CDC anushansa karata he ki ve purush jo duusare purushon ke saath yon sambandh banane main sakriy hai unako varsh main kam se kam ek baar pareekshan karaane chaiye
 The first preferred treatment for non-complicated syphilis is intravenous injection of penicillin g or a single oral dose of azithromycin
 doxiciclin or tetraciclin vaikalpik chunaav hai; halanki, janm vikrutiyon ke jokhim ke kaaran inako garbhvatee mahilaon ko dene kii anushansa nahin kii jaati he
 Antibiotic resistance to many agents such as macrolides, clindamycin, and rifampin has developed
 ceftrioxon, ek tritiy peedi sephalosporin antibiotic, penicillin aadhaarit upachaar jitna prabhavi ho saktaa he
 Large doses of intravenous penicillin are recommended for at least ten days for people affected by neurosyphilis due to poor penetration of penicillin g into the central nervous system
 yadi koi vyakti allergy se peedit he to ceftrioxon kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he yaa penicillin visugrahikaran kaa prayaas kiya ja saktaa he
 Intravenous penicillin G, applied once a week for three weeks can be used for treatment for late-onset conditions
 yadi koi vyakti allergy se peedit he to jaisaa ki sheeghra rog ke maamle main hota he lambii avadhi ke liye doxiciclin yaa tetraciclin yaa albiat kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Treatment at this stage stops the progression of the disease, but is less effective at the damage already done
 upachaar kaa sambhavit dushprabhav jerisk-harkshymer pratikriyaahai
 It often starts within an hour and persists for 24 hours, with symptoms including fever, muscle pain, headache, and tachycardia

 It is believed that 12 million people were infected with syphilis in 1999, more than 90% of which came from the developing world
 isane 700,000 se 1
