 Here it is the opposite

 Phillip Kay of the Liverpool Daily Post described the film as, "doomsday is a poorly thought out science-based fictional story that raises more questions than answers
 " Interpreting msnbc's Duralde Alonso Doomsday says: "it's a funny, derivative, confusingly edited and bloody visual film but on top of that because of the kind of grindhouse epic story that your The weft of security weaves and eventually you just follow it
 " duralde kaa maananaa tha ki agar film itani moorkhtapurna nahin thi to mitra ke paatr ko ek "yaadgaar krur bacchee" kii tarah suyogy hona chahie tha

 Berardinelli also admitted that much effort has been made in this film to develop parallel stories, which therefore reduces the chances of gain
 variety ke denis harvey ne kaha ki nil marshall kii "sahaj ection ke prati dilchaspee" ne dumsde ke liye moulikta kii kami ko dur kar diya or yah ki film main shaayad hi koi sust pal maujuud he

" " harvey ne nishkarsh ko apekshaakrit kamjor mana or abhinay kii gunvattta ko isaki style ke liye santoshjanak paaya jabaki stant sambandhi logon ke kaam ko "utkrisht" ke rup main prashansa ke liye surakshit rakhaa

 "take some of the best stuntmen and a half-hearted gentle cinematographer," Hartlob said of the effect, and you didn't even need a scriptwriter
 " Matt Zoller Sitz of The New York Times saw the character of Rona Mitra as an impersonation of Snake Plissken and considered most of the film's supporting characters to be "lifeless"
 Sitz expressed his dissatisfaction at the director's lack of investigative element in the film's acclaim for older films: "doomsday is a frantic, loud, wildly inaccurate and so derivative that it is, in the very context of its predecessors, a child's play attire
" It does not look like trying to highlight their famous images

 Angus macneil, a member of the Scottish National Party, said of the film's impact: "A complementary part is that people are thinking about Scotland as we move towards greater freedom
" lekin film ek aise desh kaa chithran karti he jo abhi bhi landan ke haathon kaa khilonaa he
 It is a decision taken in London that makes it a monitored area

 is upnaam vaale ullekhneey logon kii suchi jinka is jati se sambaddh ho bhi saktaa or nahin bhi, nimnlikhit he:- Hujjatul Islam Hazrat Maulana Qasim Nanautvi or Imam Mohammad Qasim Nanautvi is the founder of Darul Uloom Deoband, a world-renowned Islamic educational institution located in the district of Kadevbandh, Saharanpur in the state of Uttar Pradesh, North India
 inhen imam shah valiullah dehalavi kii shastreey islamic parampara kaa antim vaahak mana jaataa he, tathaa bharat main islamic paramparyon ke utthan ke liye kiye gaye kaaryon ke liye ve bharat main mujaddid alf sani tathaa shah valiullah dehalavi ke baad tisare islamic uddharak ke rup main jane jate hai
 The greatest work of Imam Mohammad Qasim Nanautvi is the establishment of Darul Uloom Deoband for teaching Islamic theology
 1867 main darul ulum kii sthapana se purv imam qaasim nanautvi ne dilli main shah valiullah dahalavi ke islamic shikshan centre main unke antim ilmi vaaris shah abdulgani mujaddidi se haddees kaa gyaan praapt kiya tha
 Shah Abdul Ghani Mujaddidi had departed from Delhi towards Madina for ever, leaving the Delhi-based center of Islamic knowledge of Imam Shah Waliullah permanently closed
 imam mohammad qaasim nanautvi ne dilli main shah abdul gani se gyaan prapti ke pashchaat angreji samrajyavad ke viruddh sashastr vidroh kaa bigul bajaayaa or shamali ke maidan main apane kuch saathiyon ke saath angreji fouj kaa muqabla kiya
 But the British government, which had been in power in Delhi, was brutally crushing every rebellion, mainly the Islamic ulama was the biggest target for them
 imam mohammad qaasim nanautavi or unke saathiyon dwaara lade gaye yuddh ne kai angrej sainikon ko maut ke ghat to utaar diya tha par yah yuddh purnatah safal nahin hua
 In the end, Imam Nanoutvi had to take refuge in many other places
 udhar angrej sarkaar ke islamic gyaan ke adhiktar sansthano ko samaapt kiye jane or musalamaanon ke bich isai dharm kaa prachaar kiye jane se kshubdh imam mohammad qaasim nanautvi ne islamic dharm shaastra tathaa apane aadhyatmik guru imam shah valiullah ke islamic bauddhik tathaa dharm shastreey viraasat kii purna raksha ke liye haji aabid hossain sahab ke saath mil kar devband main may 1867 main madrasa arabi islamic devband kii neenv rakhi
 Later this madrasa is known as Darul Uloom Deoband as the world famous Islamic university
 Conduct against accepted values in public life is considered corrupt conduct
 aam jan jivan main ise aarthik aparaadhon se joda jaataa he
 Corruption is generally referred to as a misuse of governmental power and resources for personal gain
 ek duusari or adhik vyapak paribhaasha yah he ki nijee yaa saarvajanik jivan ke kisi bhi sthapit or sweekaarya maanak kaa chori-chhipe ulanghan bhrashtachar he
 It also varies according to different standards and country
 masalan, bharat main raksha saudon main kamishan kaanaa avaidh he isliye ise bhrashtachar or raashtra- virdohi krity maan kar ghotaale kii sangya di jaati he
 But in many developed countries of the world, this is a legitimate commercial operation
 samskritiyon ke bich antar ne bhi bhrashtachar ke prashn ko pechida banaaya he
 The British, who imposed colonial rule on India during the nineteenth century, viewed Indian sexual behavior as a misconduct in the mirror of their Victorian morality

 The issue of corruption is a political question that sometimes causes governments to change
 balki yah bahut bade-bade aitihaasik parivartanon kaa vaahak bhi rahaa he
 The practice of the Roman Catholic Church charging fees in exchange for grace was labeled corruption by Martin Luther
 iske kilaaf kiye gayi dharmik sangharsh se isai dharm- sudhaar nikle
 The Protestant vote was born as a result

 There is no unity about understanding related to corruption in socio-scientific discourse
 poonjeewaad virdohi nazariyaa rakhane vaale vidwaanon kii manyata he ki bazaar aadhaarit vyavasthaayen ‘greed iz good’ ke usul par chalati hai, isliye unke tahat bhrashtachar main badhotaree honi laazmi he
 On the other hand, in the dictatorial systems of the proletariat, advocating an open society and anti-marxist intellectuals, the Communist Party officials have largely abused the resources of the state and guaranteed themselves a comfortable life at the cost of the ordinary life of the common people
 Points out

 Tax evasion is treated as a compulsion of social life under the Nizam, which is highly taxed
 isse ek siddhant yah nikalataa he ki jitne kam kanoon or niyantran honge, bhrashtachar kii zarurat utani hi kam hogi
 In favor of this view, the example of the former Soviet Union and the entire socialist countries of China is given, where despite the omnipresence of the institution of the state, a large amount of corruption exists
 ‘zyaada niyantran- zyaada bhrashtachar’ ke sameekaran ko sahi tehraane ke liye tees ke dashak ke america main kii gayi sharaab-bandi kaa udhaaharan bhi diya jaataa he jiske kaaran sangathit or aarthik bhrashtachar main abhootpurv oochaal aa gaya tha
 In the sixties and seventies some scholars had justified the presence of corruption and black money to an extent for the economic development of underdeveloped countries
 arnold je
 hidanhimer jaise siddhantkaron kaa kahana tha ki paramparabaddh or saamaajik rup se sthir samaajon ko bhrashtachar kii samasya kaa kam hi saamana karnaa padataa he
 But due to rapid industrialization and movement of population, societies continue to abandon established standards and values
 parinamswaroop bade paimaane par bhrashtachar kii parighatna paidaa hoti he
 This theory of Heidenheimer was particularly popular in the seventies
 bhrashtachar virdohi nitiyon or kaaryakramon kii vakaalat karne ke bajaay hidanhimer ne nishkarsh nikaala tha ki jaise-jaise samaaj main samruddhi badhati jaaegi, madhyavarg kii pratishtha main vruddhi hogi or shahari sabhyataa va jivan-style kaa vikaas hoga, is samasya par apane aap kaabo hota chalaa jayega
 But in the seventies itself, big political and economic scandals were exposed in Europe and America
 inamen america kaa waterget scandal or britain kaa paulson efere pramukh tha
 These scandals fueled the optimism of Heidenheimer's theory that believed in the development of middle class civic virtues
 saath ke dashak ke dauraan hi kuch anya vidwaanon ne bhi hidanhimer kii tarz par tark diya tha ki bhrashtachar kii samasya kii naitik vyakhyaayein karne se kuch hasil hone vaala nahin he
 Samuel Huntington was the chief among them
 in samaaj-vaigyanikon kii manyata thi ki bhrashtachar har paristhiti main nuksaandeh nahin hota
 In developing countries, it plays the role of oil in the machine, and the consumer revolution is accelerated by the money that people have to spend
 lekin africa main bhrashtachar ke upar vishwa bank dwaara 1969 main jari rapat ne is dharna ko dhakka pahunchaaya
 After this report, corruption was seen as an inevitable evil and a hindrance to economic development
 vishwa bank bhrashtachar ke kilaaf muhim chalaane main jute gaya
 One result of this discussion was that sociologists started showing more interest in the problem of corruption in relatively less developed countries
 viksit deshon main bhrashtachar kii samasya kaafii-kuch nazarandaaz kii jane lagi
 This approach was further strengthened in the era of globalization
 udhaar dene vaali antarrashtriya vittiya sansthaaon, un par haaavee viksit deshon or bade-bade corporeshnon ne yah guarantee karne kii koshish kii ki unke dwaara di jane vaali madad kaa sahi-sahi istemaal ho
 This resulted in the establishment of Transparency International in 1993, in which many former World Bank officials were active
 iske baad surveykshan or aankadon ke zariye bhrashtachar kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan shuru ho gaya
 But the results of these efforts cannot be considered satisfactory in any way
 2007 main danniel treezman ne ‘whot haev ve larnd about da kaaziz of karpshan from ten ears of cross naishanal imperical research?’ likh kar nateeja niklaa he ki paripakv udaarataavaadi loktantr or bazaronmukh samaaj apekshaakrit kam bhrasht hai
 In contrast, oil-exporting countries, more legislative law-makers and countries that do not control inflation are far more corrupt
 zaahir he ki ye nishkarsh kisi bhi kone se naye nahin hai
 Recently, in the countries where economic scandals have been exposed, there are all kinds of countries, big and small and underdeveloped
 bhrashtachar ko suvidhajanak or hanikaarak maanane ke in paraspar virdohi najareeyon se pare hat kar agar dekha jaae to abhi tak aarthik vruddhi ke saath uske kisi sidhe sambandh kaa sutrikaran nahin ho paaya he
 For example, two countries in Asia, South Korea and the Philippines, have very high index of corruption
 lekin, korea main aarthik vruddhi kii dar kaasi he, jabaki philippines main nichi

 prarambh main khagolashastriyon kii dharna thi ki brahmad main nai gallexiyon or kwasron kaa janm sambhavat: puraani gallexiyon ke visphot ke falswaroop hota he
 But astronomers from York University — Dr

 Wright refute this notion by studying the interactions of four groups of galaxies
 unhone yah bataaya ki gallexiyon ke bich main aisi visphotak antar kriyaayein nahin hoti hai jo nai gallexiyon ko janm de saken
 The center of most galaxies is a spherical part filled with stars, called the nucleus, and the nucleus is attached to a planar circular disk around it
 khagolvigyaani gallexiyon ko unke aakaar ke aadhaar par mukhya rup se teen bhaagon main vibhajit karaten he
 Nobody knows why galaxies assume a certain form
 shaayad yah gallexiyon ke ghurnan ke veg or usame sthit taron ke banane ki gati par nirbhar karata he
 The width and brightness of our Galaxy is not universal
 dhanu taramandal main yah sabase adhik chaudee or chamakili he
 When viewed from a distance, numerous stars appear in the galaxy
 vibhinn chamak ke taron kii sankhya ginakar, unki duuri kii gananaa kar or unki gati naapakar jyotishiyon ne gallexi ke vaastavik rup kaa bahut acha anumaan laga liya he
 If one considers the form of the galaxy in a three-dimensional recess instead of the one seen in the sky, then it is found that the galaxy is almost like a flat circular wheel whose part near the axis is somewhat bloated
 chitra main gallexi kaa bagal se chitra dikhaaya gaya he 
 The diameter of this wheel is about one million light years, miles or 63 thousand times the distance of the Sun from Earth) and the thickness is between 3,000 and 6,000 light years
 centre ke paas kii motaai lagbhag 15,000 prakashavarsh he
 The stars in our Galaxy are not evenly distributed
 bich bich main anek taraguchh hai or isaki bhi sambhaavna he ki devayani niharika ke samaan hamaari gallexi main bhi sarpil kundaliyaan hon
 There are microscopic dust and gases in the middle of the stars, which spoil the light of the distant stars
 dhuli or gas kaa ghanatv sanstha ke madhytal main adhik he
 Somewhere black clouds have formed due to thick cloud of dust
 kahin gas ke badal paas ke taron ke prakaash se uddipt hokar chamakati niharika ke rup main dikhaai padate hai
 The mass of our galaxy is approximately one trillion times the mass of the Sun
 isamen se praaia: aadha to taron kaa dravyaman he or aadha dhuli or gas kaa
 Our Galaxy is like a puffed circle in the middle
 isamen ek vrutt ke bheetar hi ve sab taare hai jo hamen akaash main pruthak-pruthak dikhaai padate hai
 Stars and galaxies are scattered sparsely around our galaxy
 hamaari gallexi ke centre ke paas taare sankhya main adhik ghaney hai or kinare kii ore apekshaakrit bikhare hue hai
 All the stars are rotating around the center, the stars near the center are at high speed and the far ones are at low speed
 hamaara surya centre se lagbhag 30-35 hajaar prakashavarsh dur he or gallexi ke madhya tal main hai
 For this reason, we see our galaxy like the mekhala which is described above
 prithvi se gallexi kaa centre dhanu taramandal kii ore he
 That's why it revolves around the center of the Galaxy
 is parikrama main uskaa veg 150 mile prati senkad hai
 Even at this velocity, the sun takes 200 million years in the entire orbit
 kuch teevr gativale taare or goleey targuch hamaari gallexi kii seemaa ke baahar hai, kintu ye bhi hamaari gallexi se sambhddha hai or usee ke ang maane jate hai lagbhag 100 goleey taraguchh gyaat hai
 Their distribution is spherical
 in taragucchon ke vitaran se gallexi kaa centre gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 Measuring the speed of wires also helps in the calculation of the center
 rup or vistaar main gallexi bahut si agong niharikaon se milti julati hai

 udaygiri ko pehle nichagiri ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 Kalidas has also addressed it by this name
 10 veen shatabdi main jab vidisha dhar ke parmaron ke haath main aa gaya, to raja bhoj ke pautra udayaditya ne apane naam se is sthaan kaa naam udaygiri rakh diya

 The left leg is shown on the heart of a particular person wearing a crown, with a huge 13-pointed serpent on top of its head
 vah varah kii stuti karne kii mudra main he
 There is no consensus regarding the identity of this particular person
 kuch viddhan ise raja bataate hai, to kuch devtaa yaa vishnu kii murti
 According to the Puranas, Varaha God saved the earth from the demon Hiranyaksha
 atah kuch vidwaan ise hiranyaksh kii murti maanate hai
 But the face of the idol is not shown to be asure
 murti ke upar naag fanon kaa gheraa hone ke kaaran log ise pataal kaa swami bhi maanate hai yaa phir samudrraj

 holocost samooche yahudee logon ko jad se khatm kar dene kaa sochaa-samajha or yojanabaddh prayaas tha
 In 1933, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany and established a racist empire, in which Jews were labeled sub-human and were not considered part of the human race
 1939 main germany dwaara vishwa yuddh bhadakaane ke baad hitler ne yahudiyon ko jad se mitaane ke liye apane antim hal ko amal main laana shuru kiya
 His soldiers began to squeeze the Jews into certain areas
 unase kaam karwaane, unhen ek jagah ikattha karne or maar daalane ke liye vishesh camp sthapit kiye gaye, jinamein sabase kukhyat tha oschvitz
 Jews were brought to these camps and killed in the closed rooms, leaving poisonous gas
 jinhen kaam karne ke kaabil nahin samajha jaataa, unhen maut ke ghat utaar diya jaataa, jabaki baaki bache yahudiyon main se zyaadaatar bhukh or beemaari se dam tod dete
 Documents revealed after the war reveal that Hitler's motive was to eliminate every single Jew from the world
 yuddh ke chah saal ke dauraan naajiyon ne takreeban 60 lakh yahudiyon kii hatya kar di, jinamein 15 lakh bachche the
 Hitler carried out his objective of eradicating Jews so effectively that one-third of the world's Jewish population was destroyed
 yah narsanhaar sankhya, prabandhan or kriyanvayan ke lihaaj se vilakshan tha
 Under this, people of a community started being killed wherever they met, simply because they were born Jewish
 in kaarnon ke chalate hi ise apni tarah kaa naam diya gaya-holocost
 Several answers have been offered to this question: religious, historical, philosophical, psychological, and Marxist
 lekin koi bhi ek jawaab kabhi santoshjanak nahin ho saktaa
 The historical answer goes like this - In the 1930s a large part of the German population agreed to live in a society that was based on hatred, the concept of ethnic superiority and violence
 ve jis vyavastha se bandhe the, uski kendriya dharna yah thi ki yahudee log har us cheez kii numaaindgi karte hai, jo germanon ke khilaaf he or isliye yahudiyon ko khatm kar diya janaa chahie
 This notion was also associated with a racialized view of the world, which considered the Germans to be part of the master race and the Jews of the anti race with destructive physical qualities
 jab yahudiyon kaa bhugolic rup se khaatmaa sambhav nahin ho sakaa, tab unhone sabase kattar rasta akhriyaar kiya, jo tha- antim hal
 More such incidents are found in history, but some things of the Holocaust make it unique
 naaji germany ke alaava bhi kai sarkaron ne camp system or technolji kaa sahaara liya or itihaas ke zyaadaatar hisse main yahudiyon kaa katl kiya jaataa rahaa
 But the Holocaust can be said to be different for two main reasons
 1
 duusare samoohon ke prati apni nitiyon se alag naajiyon ne har yahudee ko maarane kaa bidaa uthaaya
 For this, they did not care about age, sex, faith or work
 unhone is makasad ko anjaam dene ke liye khaas taur par ek aadhunik naukarshahi kaa istemaal kiya
 2
 The Nazi leadership said that eradicating Jews from the world would be beneficial for the German people and the whole of humanity
 haalanki asal main yahudiyon kii ore se unhen koi khatra nahin tha

 ise visheshat: taatkaalik darbari samskruti or sanskrit sahitya se uttejnaa mili
 Certain portions of Sanskrit literature have led him to a classical discipline
 hindi main 'reeti' yaa 'kavyariti' shabd kaa prayog kavyashastra ke liye hua tha
 Therefore, keeping in view the poetic general creation process and the majority of the characteristic texts of rasa, ornamentation etc
, the poetry of this time has been called 'ritikavya'
 is kavy kii shringaari pravritiyon kii puraani parampara ke spasht sanket sanskrit, praakrit, apbhransh, farsi or hindi ke adikavy tathaa krishnakavy kii shringaari pravritiyon main milte hai
 There have been many poets in this period who were also Acharyas and who wrote texts giving the characteristics of various Kavyangas
 is yug main shringaar kii pradhanta rahi
 This era was the era of liberation
 mukhyatya kavitt, savaiye or dohe is yug main likhe gaye
 Poets were kings-based, so the poetry of this era was mostly courtier, as a result of which special amount of miraculous euphemism is available in it, but the poem also became alienated from ordinary people
 reetikaal ke adhikansh kavi darbari the
 Keshavdas, Pratap Singh, Bihari, Matiram, Bhushan, Chintamani, Dev, Bhikharidas, Raghunath, Beni, Gang, Tikaram, Gwal, Chandrashekhar Bajpai, Harnam, Vice Chancellor Mishra, Nevaaz, Surti Mishra, Kavindra Udayanath, Rishinath, Ratan Kavi, Beni Bandijan , Beni Praveen, Brahmadatta, Thakur Bundelkhandi, Bodha, Guman Mishra, etc
 and many poets were kings, such as Maharaj Jaswant Singh, Bhagwant Rai Kheichi, Bhupathi, Rasnidhi, Maharaj Vishwanath, Dwijdev
 reetikavy rachana kaa aarambh ek sanskritgya ne kiya
 These were Acharya Keshavdas, whose famous compositions are Kavipriya, Rasikapriya and Ramachandrika

 Symptoms are in couplets and examples in Kavitasvaiya
 lakshan-lakshya-granthon kii yahi parampara reetikavy main viksit hui
 Ramachandrika is Keshava's anthology in which the vigorous Kalacheta of a vigilante artist emerged in place of devotion to devotion

 The poets of Reetikal lived in the shelter of kings and nobles
 vahaan manoranjan or kalavilas kaa vaataavaran swaabhaavik tha
 The main means of intellectual enjoyment was considered idiomatic there
 aise vaataavaran main likhaa gaya sahitya adhiktar shringarmulak or kalavaichitraya se yukt tha
 But at the same time, there were also independent singers of Prem who have touched the depths of love

 Among such poets, Bhushan is prominent, who, despite adopting the ritual style, described the valor of valor vigorously
 is samay niti, vairaygy or bhakthi se sambandhit kavy bhi likhaa gaya
 a number of notebooks were also produced
 idhar ke shodhakarya main is samay kii shringaretar rachanaayen or prabandhkavy prachur pariman main mil rahe hai
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to consider ritual poetry as absolutely one-sided and consistent
 is samay ke kavy main purvavarti kaalon kii sabhi pravritiyaan sakriy hai
 This main stream is that of Shringarakavya, which has been considered as a real demonstrator of the poetic wealth of this time
 shringaari kavy teen virgon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 The first category is of the poets whose representatives are Keshava, Chintamani, Bhikharidas, Dev, Matiram and Padmakar etc
 in kaviyon ne dohon main ras, alankaar or nayika ke lakshan dekar kavitt savaie main prem or saundarya kii kalapurna maarmik vyanjana kii he
 The classical discussion represented in Sanskrit literature has more following them
 par kuch ne thodi moulikta bhi dikhaai he, jaise bhikharidas kaa hindi chhandon kaa nirupan
 The second category is of recited poets
 in kaviyon ne lakshan nahin nirupit kiye, keval unke aadhaar par kavyrachana kii
 Bihari is the best among them, presenting his "satsai" in couplets
 vibhinn mudraonvaale atyant vyanjak saundaryachitron or prem kii bhavadashaon kaa anupam ankan inke kavy main miltaa he
 In the third category, Ghanananda, Bodha, Dwijdev Thakur, etc
 are free poets who have given expression of free love
 inaki rachanaaon main prem kii tivrata or gahanta kii atyant prabhaavshaalee vyanjana hui he
 Ritikavya is primarily a poetry of fleshy makeup
 isamen nar-narijivan ke romantic pakshon kaa sundar udghaatan hua he
 The more poetic is in the Muktak style, but there are also the Manavakyas
 in do sau varshon main shringaarakavy kaa apurv utkarsh hua
 But slowly the rituals increased and the Hindi poetry became narrower
 aadhunik yug tak aate aate in donon kamiyon kii ore sahityakaron kaa dhyaan vishesh rup se aakrisht hua
 History testifies that this era was a period of splendid development even in its defeat period
 mughal darbar ke haram main paanch-paanch hajaar rupasiyaan rahati thim
 Meena used to be a marketer, there was a free trade of sura-sundari

 "padmakar has outlined the outline of the then courts in one verse - ahalokikta, shringaarikta, nayikabhed or alankaar-priyata is yug kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai
 Almost all poets have adopted Braj language
 swatantra kavita kam likhi gai, ras, alankaar vagairah kavyangon ke lakshan likhte samay udhaaharan ke rup main - visheshkar shringaar ke alambanon evam uddipano ke udhaaharan ke rup main - saras rachanaaen is yug main likhi gayi
 The Bhushan poet also gave compositions of Veer Ras
 bhav-paksh kii apeksha kala-paksh adhik samrudh rahaa
 Special attention was not given to word-power, nor to the drama of drama
 vishyon kaa sankoch ho gaya or moulikta kaa hraas hone laga
 There were many poets at this time - Keshav, Chintamani, Dev, Bihari, Matiram, Bhushan, Ghanananda, Padmakar etc
 inamen se keshav, bihari or bhushan ko is yug kaa pratinidhi kavi mana ja saktaa he
 Bihari fully developed the possibilities of the couplets
 aapako reeti-kaal kaa pratinidhi kavi mana ja saktaa he
 Poets of this period can be divided into three categories - reetibaddh kavi Free poet ritisiddh kavi Scholars are also of the opinion that poets of this period have fully adhered to dignity in poetry
