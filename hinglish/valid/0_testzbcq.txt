 jaya ekadshi ke vishay main jo katha prachlit he uske anusaar dharmraj yudhisthir bhagwaan shri krishna se nivedan karte hai ki magh shukla ekadshi ko kinaki puja kerani chahie, tathaa is ekadshi kaa kya mahatmay he
 Shri Krishna says the Ekadashi of Magh Shukla Paksha is called "jaya Ekadashi"
 yah ekadshi bahut hi punyadaayi he, is ekadshi kaa vrath karne se vyakti neech yoni jaise bhoot, pret, pishaach kii yoni se mukt ho jaataa he
 Sri Krishna also narrated a story in this context to Yudhishthira
 nandan van main utsav chal rahaa tha
 All the gods, saints and divine men were present in this festival
 us samay gandharva gayan kar rahe the or gandharva kanyaayein nrity prastut kar rahi thim
 There was a dance of a Gandharva girl named Mallyavan and a Gandharva girl named Pushpavati
 isi bich pushyavati kii nazar jaise hi malyawaan par padi vah us par mohit ho gayi
 Forgetting the dignity of the Pushyavati Sabha, she started dancing so that Mallyavan was attracted to her
 malyawaan gandharva kanya kii bhangima ko dekhakar sud budh kho baitha or gayan kii maryaada se bhatak gaya jisase sur taal uskaa saath chhod gayi
 Indra became enraged at Pushpavati and Mallyavan's indecent act and cursed them both to deprive them of heaven and dwell on earth
 mrityu lok main ati neech pishaach yoni aap donon ko praapt hon
 The curse immediately led to both vampires and a tree on the Himalayan mountains
 yahaan pishaach yoni main inhen atyant ksht bhogana pad rahaa tha
 Once, both were extremely sad on the day of Magh Shukla Paksha Ekadashi, that day they were only fruitful
 raatri ke samay donon ko bahut thandh lag rahi thi at: donon raat bhar saath baith kar jaagate rahe
 Both died due to cold, and inadvertently, Jaya Ekadashi fasted and both got relief from the vampire vagina
 ab malyawaan or pushpavati pehle se bhi sundar ho gayi or swarg lo main unhen sthaan mil gaya
 When Devraj saw both, he was surprised and asked how he got rid of the vampire vagina
 malyawaan ke kaha yah bhagwaan vishnu kii jaya ekadshi kaa prabhaav he
 We are freed from the vampire vagina by the effects of this Ekadashi
 indra isse ati prasann hue or kaha ki aap jagdishwar ke bhakt hai isliye aap ab se mere liye aadarneey he aap swarg main anand purvak vihaar karen
 The storyteller Shri Krishna told that on the day of Jaya Ekadashi, Jagapathi Jagadishwar Lord Vishnu is the most revered
 jo shraddhalu bhakt is ekadshi kaa vrath rakhte hai unhen dashami tithi se ko ek samay aahaar karnaa chahie
 Keep in mind that the diet should be satvic
 ekadshi ke din shri vishnu kaa dhyaan karke sankalp karen or phir dhoop, deep, chandan, fal, til, evam panchamrita se vishnu kii puja kare
 Keep fast for the whole day, if possible, keep the fast at night and do Jagran
 agar raatri main vrath sambhav na ho to falahar kar sakate hai
 On the day of Dwadashi, after giving food to the Brahmins, bid them farewell by giving them nut nuts

567 khadi se arth he khari arthath shuddh athwa theth hindi boli
 The pure or typical Hindi dialect or language was then referred to as the Khari or Khadi dialect, while in Hindustan, the Arabic, Persian and Hindustani words were a mixed Urdu language or Awadhi or Braj language on the other hand
 theth yaa shuddh hindi kaa chalan na tha
 It was around the beginning of the 18th century that some Hindi prose writers began writing in typical Hindi
 isi theth hindi ko khari hindi yaa khadi hindi boli kaha gaya
 Khadi Boli means Khadi Boli from Hindi which has been approved by the Indian Constitution as the official language
 bhashavigyaan kii drushti se ise adarsh hindi, urdu tathaa hindustani kii mul aadhaar swaroop boli hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 Khadi dialect is the dialect of West Ruhelkhand, North Doab of Ganga and Ambala district which is spoken by the rural public as mother tongue
 is pradesh main rampur, bijanour, meerut, mujffarnagar, muradabad, saharanpur, dehradun kaa maidani bhaag, ambala tathaa kalsia or bhootpurv patiala riyasat ke purvi bhaag aate hai
 Khadi Boli is the dialect that does not have the impression of Brajbhasha or Awadhi etc

 In other words, the dialect that does not have the impression of Braj or Awadhi etc
 is cold Hindi
 khadi boli aaj kii rashtrabhasha hindi kaa purv rup he
 It is a form of defined western Hindi
 iskaa itihaas shatabdiyon se chalaa aa rahaa he
 At the time when the Muslims came and settled in this country, at that time they were required to accept one of the languages here
 ve praayah dilli or uske poorabi praanton main hi adhikta se based the or brajabhash tathaa avadhi bhashaayen, clisht hone ke kaaran apana nahin sakate the, isaliye unhone meerut or uske aasapaas kii boli grahan kii or uskaa naam khadi boli rakhaa
 In the same dialect, he slowly added Persian and Arabic words, which eventually led to the creation of the current Urdu language
 vikrami 14veen shatabdi main pehle-pahal amir khusro ne is prantiy boli kaa prayog karnaa aarambh kiya or usamen bahut kuch kavita kii, jo saral tathaa saras hone ke kaaran sheeghra hi prachlit ho gai
 For a long time, Muslims used to practice this dialect in the colloquial and literature, but later it started being propagated among Hindus as well
 15veen or 16 veen shatabdi main koi koi hindi ke kavi bhi apni kavita main kahin kahin iskaa prayog karne lage the, par unki sankhya praayah nahin ke samaan thi
 Most of the poetry continued to be in Awadhi and Vrajbhasha
 18veen shatavdhi main hindu bhi sahitya main iskaa vyavhaar karne lage, par padya main nahin, keval gadhy main; or tabhi se maanon vartmaan hindi gadhy kaa janm hua, jiske acharya munshi sadasukhlal, lallu ji laal or sadal mishra maane jate hai
 Just as Muslims created the current Urdu language by filling the words of Persian and Arabic etc
, similarly Hindus also introduced the current Hindi by increasing the number of Sanskrit words in it
 idhar thode dinon se kuch log sanskritprachur vartmaan hindi main bhi kavita karne lag gaye hai or kavita ke kaam ke liye usee ko khadi boli kehete hai
 a form of present-day Hindi in which a multiplicity of Sanskrit words has been created in the current Hindi language and by the excess of Persian and Arabic words, the present Urdu language has been created
 saahitiyik sandarbh main braj, avadhi aadi boliyon main sahitya kaa parthaky karne ke liye aadhunik hindi sahitya ko khadi boli sahitya ke naam se abhihit kiya jaataa he
 It is the most popular, simple and understandable language of India
 bihar, jharkhand, uttarapradesh, uttaranchal, madhyapradesh, chhattisgarh, rajasthan, himachal pradesh evam haryana hindi bhashabhashi rajya hai
 But apart from this, except for a few places in the far south, it is propagated in most of the country
 khadi boli anek naamon se abhihit kii gai he yatha-hindui, hindvi, dakkhini, dakhni yaa dakani, rekhta, hindostani, hindustani aadi
 Dr
 Grierson named it Vernacular Hindustani and Dr
 Suniti Kumar Chatterjee named it as Janpadiya Hindustani
 dow chatarji khadi boli ke saahitiyik rup ko sadhu hindi yaa nagari hindi ke naam se abhihit karte hai
 But Dr
 Grierson has given it the title of High Hindi
 isaki vyakhya vibhinn vidwaanon ne bhinn bhinn rup se kii he
 The following categories of opinions of these scholars are- atyant pracheen kaal se hi himalay tathaa vindhyas parvat ke bich kii bhoomi aryaavart ke naam se prakhyat he
 The region in between is called Madhya Pradesh, which is the focal point of Indian culture and civilization
 sanskrit, pali tathaa shauraseni praakrit vibhinn yugon main is madhyadesh kii bhashaa thi
 After the Shaurseni Prakrit in chronology, the Shaurseni Apabhramsa was propagated in this region
 yah kathy shauraseni apbhransh bhashaa hi kalantar main kadachit khadi boli ke rup main parinat hui he
 Thus the origin of the Khadi dialect is believed to be from the Shaurseni Apabhramsa, although the development of this Apabhransh is not found in literary form
 bhoj or hammirdev ke samay se apbhransh kaavyon kii jo parampara chalati rahi uske bheetar khadi boli ke pracheen rup kii jhalak dikhaai padati he
 After this, in the beginning of Bhaktikal, the saint poet of Nirguna stream used to treat Khadi Boli in his Sadhukkari language
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki musalamaanon ke dwaara hi khadi boli astitv main laai gai or uskaa mularoop urdu he, jisase aadhunik hindi kii bhashaa arabi farsi shabdon ko nikaalkar garh lee gai
 According to the opinion of eminent philologist, Dr
 Grierson, the standing dialect is a gift of the British
 mughal samrajya ke dhwans se khadi boli ke prachaar main sahaayta pahaunchi
 The way Ur, Urdu, Mir, Insha, etc
, many of the Urdu poets started coming towards the east, in the same way, the Hindu traders around Delhi started spreading to the eastern cities of Lucknow, Faizabad, Prayag, Kashi, Patna, etc
 for livelihood
 inke saath hi saath unki bolchaal kii bhashaa khadi boli bhi lagi chalati thi
 In this way, the language of the market of big cities also became very spoken
 yah khadi boli asli or swaabhaavik bhashaa thi, maulaviyon or munshiyon kii urdu-e-mualla nahin
 With regard to the first half of the 19th century, he writes that it was the time of the birth of the Hindi language, which was invented by the British and was first used as a literary prose by Lallu Ji Lal in his Prem Sagar under the command of Gilchrist
 lallu ji laal or pan sadal mishra ko khadi boli ke unnayak athwa isko pragati pradaan karanevaala to mana ja saktaa he, parantu inhen khadi boli kaa janmdata kahana satya se yukt tathaa tathyon se pramanit nahin he
 After careful consideration of the ancient tradition of Khadi Boli, the inaccuracy of this statement proves itself
 musalamaanon ke dwaara iske prasar main sahaayta avashya praapt hui
 Urdu is not an independent language, but only a genre of standing dialect, in which the majority of Persian and Arabic words are found and which are written in Persian script
 urdu sahitya ke itihaas par dhyaan dene se yah baat spasht pramanit he
 Many Muslim poets have written poetry in Persian mixed dialect, which they called 'rekhta'
 yah parampara 18veen 19veen shatee main dilli ke antim badshaah bahadurshah tathaa lakhanu ke antim nawab vaajibili shah tak chalati rahi
 Generally, Lallu Ji Lal, Sadal Mishra, Inshalla Khan and Munshi Sadasuklal are known as the founders of Khadi Boli prose but none of them have the privilege of revealing its tradition
 aadhunik khadi boli gadhy kii parampara kii pratishtha kaa shrey bhaaratendu babu harishchandra evam raja shivaprasad sitarehind ko praapt he jinhone apni rachanaaon ke dwaara ek saral sarvasammat gadhyshailee kaa pravartan kiya
 Later, people adopted the style of Bharatendu more
 vastut: aadhunik hindi sahitya khadi boli kaa hi sahitya he jiske liye devanagari lipi kaa saamanyat: vyavhaar kiya jaataa he or jisamen sanskrit, paali, praakrit aadi ke shabdon or prakrutiyon ke saath desh main prachlit anek bhashaaon or janboliyon kii chaaya apane tadbhav rup main vartmaan he

 fredrick ingels ne karl marks dwaara pratipaadit saamaajik-aarthik-rajnatik siddhanth ko vaigyanik samaajwaad kaa naam diya
 Although Marx never used the term scientific socialism, he criticized utopian socialism
 marks ko vaigyanik samaajwaad kaa praneta mana jaataa he
 Marx was a resident of a German state and Germany was politically divided into several states before 1871 AD, and was economically backward
 at: yahan par samaajawaadee vichaaron kaa prachaar der se hua
 Although there is a glimpse of socialism in the ideas of Johann Fichte, Germany's first and foremost socialist thinker is considered to be Karl Marx
 marks ke vichaaron par higel ke adarshavaad, forwak ke bhautikwaad, britain ke shastreey arthshaastra, tathaa france kii krantikari raajnneeti kaa prabhaav he
 Marx coordinated his foregoing and contemporary socialist ideas
 uske abhinn mitra or sahakaari angills ne bhi samaajawaadee vichaar pratipaadit kiye hai, parantu unamem adhikanshat: marks ke siddhanton kii vyakhya he, at: uske lekh marxvad ke hi ang maane jate hai
 Marx's philosophy is called dialectical materialism
 marks ke liye vaastaviktaa vichaar maatr nahin bhautik satya he; vichaar swayan padaarth kaa viksit rup he
 His materialism is developmental, but this development takes place dialectically
 is prakaar marks, hegal ke vichaarwaad kaa virdohi he parantu uski dwandvatmak pranali ko sweekaar karata he
 The second feature of Marx's ideas is his historical materialism
 kuch lekhak isko itihaas kii arthshaastreey vyakhya bhi kehete hai
 Marx proved that the basis of social changes is the means of production and changes in the production relations affected by it
 apni pratibha ke anusaar manushya sadaiv kii utpaadan ke sadhano main unnati karata he, parantu ek sthiti aati he jab is kaaran utpaadan sambandhon par bhi asar padane lagata he or utpaadan ke sadhano ke swami-shoshak-or in sadhano kaa prayog karanevaala shoshit varg main sangharsh aarambh ho jaataa he
 The owner wants to continue the order of exploitation by maintaining the old condition, but the exploited class and the society are interested in using new means of production by establishing new production relations
 at: shoshak or shoshit ke bich vargsangharsh kranti kaa rup dhaaran karata he or uske dwaara ek nae samaaj kaa janm hota he
 Through this process, society has gone through these stages of primitive tribal communism, ancient slavery, medieval feudalism and modern capitalism
 abhi tak kaa itihaas vargsangharsh kaa itihaas he, aaj bhi poonjipati or sarvhaara varg ke bich yah sangharsh he, jiskaa ant sarvhaara kranti dwaara samaajwaad kii sthapana se hoga
 The future communist state will be the best form of this socialist society
 marks ne poonjivadi samaaj kaa gudh or vistrut vishleshan kiya he
 The name of his major book is das capital
 is sambandh main uske argh or atirikt argh sambandhi siddhant mukhya hai
 He says that the characteristic of capitalist society is mostly the production of commodities, the capitalist makes most of the things to sell, not just for his use
 panya vastuen apane argh ke aadhaar par kharidi bechi jaati hai
 But in the capitalist society, the labor force of the laborer also becomes a commodity and it is also sold on the basis of its argh
 prayek cheez ke argh kaa aadhaar uske andar prayukt saamaajik rup se aavashyak shram he jiskaa maapdand samay he
 The worker by his manpower produces a lot of power for the capitalist, but his work force is very low
 in donon kaa antar atirikt argh he or yah atirikt argh jiskaa aadhaar majdoor kaa shram he poonjeewaadi munaafe, sood, kamishan aadi kaa aadhaar he
 The summary is that the source of capital is labor empowerment
 marks kaa yah vichaar vargsangharsh ko protsaahan detaa he
 The specialty of capitalism is that there is competition in it and the big capitalist defeats the small capitalist and destroys it and becomes the owner of his capital
 vah apni poonji or uske laabh ko bhi phir se utpaadan ke kram main laga detaa he
 Thus both the capital and the yield increase

 When Ahilyabai was about sixty-two years old, Dauhitra Nathu passed away
 chaar varsh peeche damaad yashwantrao phanse na rahaa or inaki putree muktabai sati ho gai
 He had affection for Malharrao, the son of a distant relative Tukojirao; She used to think that in future it will handle the doors of governance, system, justice and prajaranjan; But he kept grieving them till the end
 ahilyabai ne apane rajya kii simaaon ke baahar bharat-bhar ke prasiddh tirthon or sthanon main mandir banawaye, ghat bandhwaae, kuon or baavadiyon kaa nirmaan kiya, maarg banawaye-sudharwaaye, bhukhon ke liye annsatr khole, pyaason ke liye pyau bithlaayin, mandiron main vidwaanon kii niyukti shastron ke manan-chintan or pravachan hetu kii
 And, by sacrificing the false temptation of self-respect, always tried to do justice - till death
 ye usee parampara main thim jisamen unke samakaleen puna ke nyaayadhish ramshastri the or unke peeche jhansi kii rani lakshmibai hui
 It was during her lifetime that the public began to understand and say 'devi'
 itnaa bada vyaktitv janata ne apni aankhon dekha hi kahan tha
 When there was a mess around
 shashan or vyavastha ke naam par ghor atyaachaar ho rahe the
 People - ordinary householders, peasants, laborers - were sobbing in a very inferior state
 unka ekmaatr sahaara-dharm-andhvishwaason, bhay traason or rudhiyon kii jakad main ksaa ja rahaa tha
 There was neither power nor faith in justice
 aise kaal kii un vikat paristhitiyon main ahilyabai ne jo kuch kiya-or bahut kiya
 - She is memorable
 indore main prati varsh bhadrapada krishna chaturdashi ke din ahilyotsav hota chalaa aata he
 There is a difference of opinion regarding the importance of their temple building and other religious functions
 in kaaryon main ahilyabai ne andhadhundh kharch kiya or sena nae dhang par sangathit nahin kii
 Tukoji Holkar's army had to bear the brunt of the Northern Expeditions, sometimes it is alleged that these temples have been told the outposts of Hinduism
 tukojirao holkar ke paas baarah lakh rupye the jab vah ahilyabai se rupye kii maang par maang kar rahaa tha or sansar ko dikhalaataa tha ki rupye-paise se tang hoon
 Then what was the fault of Ahilyabai? The spirit of religion has been the biggest driving force for Hindus; Ahilyabai used the same
 tatkaaleen andhvishwaason or rudhiyon kaa varnan upanyaas main aayaa he
 One of these beliefs was to jump from a hill in the Narmada arrow near Mandhata and commit suicide to attain salvation
 ahilyabai ke sambandh main do prakaar kii vichaardhaaraen rahi hai
 In one, she has been given the title of incarnation of Goddess, in the second she has shown reverence for superstitions and stereotypes along with her superlative qualities
 vah andhere main prakaash-kiran ke samaan thim, jise andheraa baar-baar grasane kii cheshtaa karata rahaa
 Due to her excellent ideas and ethical conduct, she got the status of Goddess in the society
 malharav ke bhai-bandon main tukojirao holkar ek vishwaasapaatr yuvak the
 Malharrao had also kept him with him forever and got ready for the reign
 ahilyabai ne inhen apana senapati banaaya or chouth vasuul karne kaa kaam unhen saunp diya
 Though Tukojirao Holkar was older than Ahilyabai at the age, but Tukoji considered her as his mother and used to do the work of the state with full devotion and truth
 ahilyabai kaa un par itnaa prem or vishwaas tha ki vah bhi unhen putr jaisaa maanati thim
 'khandoji Sut Tukoji Holkar' is said in the state papers wherever they are mentioned and also in the seals
 rajya kii chintaa kaa bhaar or us par praanon se bhi pyaare logon kaa viyog
 Ahilyabai's body could not handle all this grief
 or 13 agast san 1795 ko unki jivan-lila samaapt ho gai
 After Ahilyabai's death, Tukoji ascended the throne of Indore

 There are approximately 1,10,000 verses in the entire Mahabharata, ten times more in magnitude than the Greek poems Iliad and Odyssey
 hindu manyataon, puranic sandarbho evam swayan mahabharat ke anusaar is kavy kaa rachanaakaar vedavyas ji ko mana jaataa he
 The author of this poem, Ved Vyas ji, in his unique poetry has depicted the greatest mysteries of the Vedas, Vedangas and Upanishads
 iske atirikt is kavy main nyaay, shiksha, chikitsa, jyotish, yudhniti, yogashastra, arthshaastra, vaastushastra, shilpashaastra, kaamshaastra, khagolavidya tathaa dharamshastra kaa bhi vistaar se varnan kiya gaya hai
 It took 3 years for Ved Vyas ji to complete the Mahabharata, it may be because writing script art had not developed so much at that time, it was safe to remember the traditional Vedic texts by the sages in that period from generation to generation
 Used to be kept
 us samay sanskrit rishiyon kii bhashaa thi or brahmi aam bolchaal kii bhashaa hua karti thi
 In this way the entire Vedic literature was memorized orally by the sages for generations and generations

 mahabharat chandravanshiyon ke do pariwaron kaurav or pandav ke bich hue yuddh kaa vrittant he
 The struggle for land between 100 Kaurava brothers and five Pandava brothers eventually led to the Mahabharata War
 is yuddh kii bhartiya or pashchimi vidwaanon dwaara kai bhinn bhinn nirdhaarit kii gayi tithiyaan nimnlikhit hai- Main mention: Detailed story of Mahabharata puraanon ke anusaar brahma ji se atri, atri se chandramaa, chandramaa se budh or budh se ila-nandan pururava kaa janm hua
 From him, Yayati was born to King Nahusha and Nahusha to Age
 yayati se puru hue
 The dynasty of Puru included Bharata and King Kuru in the clan of Bharata
 kuru ke vansh main shantanu hue
 Ganganandan Bhishma was born from Shantanu
 shantanu se satyavati ke garbh se chitrangad or vichitraveery utpann hue the
 Killed by Gandharva named Chitrangad and King Vichitravirya, who was suffering from Rajyakshama, died
 tab satyavati kii ajna se vyasaji ne niyog ke dwaara ambika ke garbh se dhritarashtra or ambalika ke garbh se pandu ko utpann kiya
 Dhritarashtra gave birth to a hundred sons by Gandhari, of which Duryodhana was the eldest and Pandu had five sons like Yudhishthra, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva etc
 dhritarashtra janm se hi netraheen the, atah unki jagah par pandu ko raja banaaya gaya
 Once, while playing the game in the forest, a moth-headed mrigarupadhari sage died from the arrow of Pandu
 us rishi se shaapit ho ki "ab jab kabhi bhi tu maithunarat hoga to teri mrityu ho jaayegi", pandu atyant duhkhi hokar apni raniyon sahit samast vaasanaon kaa tyaag karke tathaa hastinapur main dhritarashtra ko apana kaa pratinidhi banaakar van main rahane lagen
 At the behest of King Pandu, Kunti invited religion from the mantra given by the sage Durvasa to Yudhishthira and later to Bhima from Vayudev and Arjuna from Indra
 kunti se hi us mantra kii diksha le maadri ne ashwanikumaron se nakul tathaa sahadev ko janm diya
 One day, while traveling on the banks of Sarita in the forest with Raja Pandu Madri, Pandu became agitated due to his fickleness which led to his death
 maadri unke saath sati ho gai kintu putron ke paalan-poshan ke liye kunti hastinapur laut ai
 Before marriage, Kunti gave birth to Karna from the Sun's share and in the fear of localism, Karna was drowned in the Ganges river
 dhritarashtra ke sarathi adhirath ne use bachaakar uskaa paalan kiya
 Karna was interested in warfare, so after Dronacharya's refusal, he got education from Parashurama
 shakuni ke chhalkapat se duryodhana ne pandavon ko bachapan main kai baar maarane kaa praytn kiya tathaa yuvavastha main bhi jab yudhisthir ko yuvaraj bana diya gaya to laksh ke bane hue ghar laakshagrah main pandavon ko bhejkar unhen aag se jalaane kaa praytn kiya, kintu vidura kii sahaayta ke kaaran se ve us jalte hue grih se baahar nikal gayi
 The Pandavas went from there to the city of Ekchakra and after making a costume of the Muni, resided in the house of a Brahmin
 phir vyas ji ke kehane par ve paanchal rajya main gayi jahaan draupadi kaa swayamvar honevaala tha
 There, one after the other, all the kings and princes tried to target the fish, but success was not lost
 tatpashchaat arjuna ne tailpaatr main pratibimb ko dekhte huye ek hi baan se matsay ko bhed daalaa or draupadi ne aage bad kar arjuna ke gale main varmala daal deen
 According to the promise of Mother Kunti, the five Pandavas received Draupadi as a wife
 draupadi ke swayamvar ke samay duryodhana ke saath hi saath drupad,dhridhyumna evam anek anya logon ko andeh ho gaya tha ki ve paanch brahman pandav hi hai
 Hence, Drupada invited him to his kingdom to test him
 rajaprasaad main drupad evam dhridhyumna ne pehle rajkosh ko dikhaaya kintu pandavon ne vahaan rakhe ratnabhushanon tathaa ratna-maaniky aadi main kisi prakaar kii ruchi nahin dikhaai
 But when they went to the armory, they all showed great interest in the weapons kept there and kept the weapons of their choice
 unke kriya-kalap se drupad ko vishwaas ho gaya ki ye brahmanon ke rup main pandav hi hai
 Before Draupadi Swayamvar, all the Pandavas except Vidur were considered dead and due to this Dhritarashtra made Duryodhana the crown prince
 grihayuddh ke sankat se bachane ke liye yudhisthir ne dhritarashtra dwaara die khandahar swarup khandav van ko aadhe rajya ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 There, Arjuna, along with Shri Krishna, defeated all the gods in battle and burnt Khandavavan and satisfied the fire made by Indra by ridding himself of his arrows
 iske falswarup arjuna ne agnidev se divya gandiv dhanush or uttam rath tathaa shrikrishna ne sudarshan chakra praapt kiya
 Indra was shocked to see the valor of his son Arjuna
 unhone khandavaprastha ke wanon ko hataa diya
 After that the Pandavas beautified the city with the help of Maya demon along with Shri Krishna
 vah shahar ek dwitiya swarg ke samaan ho gaya
 At the behest of Indra, Dev Shilpi Vishwakarma and Maya Demon together built the Khandava forest into a grand city as Indrapuri, which was named Indraprastha
 pandavon ne sampoorn dishaao par vijay pate hue prachur suvarnrashi se paripurna rajasuya yajna kaa anushthan kiya
 His splendor became unbearable for Duryodhana, so Shakuni, Karna and Duryodhana etc
 instigated the yoke with Yudhishthira and won his brothers, Draupadi and his kingdom by treacherous gaming and laughing and expelling Draupadi in the Kuru Rajya Sabha
 Tried
 parantu gandhari ne aakar aisa hone se roak diya
 Dhritarashtra once again ordered Duryodhana to gamble with him
 yah tay hua ki ek hi daanv main jo bhi paksh haar jayega, ve mrigcharm dhaaran kar baarah varsh vanvaas karenge or ek varsh agyatavaas main rahenge
 If they are recognized even in that one year, then they will have to suffer twelve years of exile again
 is prakaar pun jue main parrast hokar yudhisthir apane bhaaiyon sahit van main chale gayi
 After the twelfth year there, he went to Virat Nagar for one year of exile
 jab kaurav viraat kii gauon ko harkar le jane lage, tab unhen arjuna ne parrast kiya
 At that time, the Kauravas had recognized the Pandavas, but their unknown residence was completed by then
 parantu 12 varsho ke gyaat or ek varsh ke agyatavaas puraa karne ke baad bhi kauravon ne pandavon ko unka rajya dene se manaa kar diya
 Bhishma fought for ten days and killed most of the Pandava army with his arrows
 bhishma kii mrityu unki ichha ke adheen thi
 On the suggestion of Shri Krishna, the Pandavas asked Bhishma the remedy for his death
 bhishma ne kaha ki pandav shikhandi ko saamne karke yuddh lade
 Bhishma considered her to be a girl and after getting him in front, he was not going to wield weapons
 or shikhandi ko apane purv janm ke apmaan kaa badla bhi lenaa tha uske liye shivaji se vardaan bhi liya ki bhishma ki mrityu kaa kaaran banegi
 10 In the battle of the day, Arjuna placed Shikhandi on his chariot, and seeing Shikhandi in front, Bhishma gave up his bow and Arjuna with his sack put him to sleep on the bed of arrows
 tab acharya dron ne senapatitv kaa bhaar grahan kiya
 Again there was a fierce war on both sides
 viraat or drupad aadi raja dronrupi samudr main dub gayi the
 But when Pandavo convinces Drona that Ashwatthama was killed
 to acharya dron ne niraash hon astr shastr tyagkar uske baad yoga samadhi le kar apana sharir tyaag diya
 At such a time, Dhrishtadyumna cut the forehead of Drona with a sword for yoga samadhi and dropped it on the ground
 dron vadh ke pashchaat karn kaurav sena kaa karnadhaar hua
 Karna and Arjuna had a great war-like battle involving weapons and weapons, which was also going to defeat the devasur-sangram
 karn or arjuna ke sangram main karn ne apane baanon se shatru-paksh ke bahut-se veeron kaa sanhaar kar daalaa
 Although the war was getting stale, Karna got entangled when a wheel of his chariot got stuck in the earth
 guru parashuram ke shaap ke kaaran vah apane ko divine astron ke prayog main bhi asamarth paakar rath ke pahie ko nikaalane ke liye neeche utarataa he
 Then Krishna asks Arjuna to kill him by reminding him of the Abhimanyu slaughter, the prostitute and his vow to slay Karna at the Kuru Sabha, then Arjuna beheads Karna with a divine weapon
 tadnantar raja shalya kaurav-sena ke senapati hue, kintu ve yuddh main aadhe din tak hi tik sake
 King Yudhishthira killed him by noon
 duryodhana kii sari sena ke maare jane par ant main uskaa bhimsen ke saath gada yuddh hua
 Bhima slapped him on the thigh and killed him
 iskaa pratishodh lene ke liye ashwatthama ne raatri main pandavon kii ek akshuhinee sena, draupadi ke paanchon putron, uske paanchaladeshiy bandhuon tathaa dhridhyumna ko sadaa ke liye sula diya
 Then Arjuna defeated Ashwatthama and took out the gem of his head
 phir ashwatthama ne uttara ke garbh par brahmastra kaa prayog kiya
 His womb was often burnt by his weapon, but Lord Krishna gave him life again
 uttara kaa vahi garbhasth shishu aage chalakar raja parakshit ke naam se vikhyath hua
 At the end of this war, Kritavarma, Kripacharya and Ashwatthama, three Kauravapaksiyas and five Pandavas, Satyaki and Sri Krishna, these seven Pandavapakshiya heroes survived
 tatpashchaat yudhisthir rajsinghaasana par asin hue
 Yadavakul was killed due to the curse of Brahmins and Gandhari
 balbhadraji yoga se apana sharir tyaag kar sheshnag swarup hokar samudr main chale gayi
 One day, all the great-grandchildren of Lord Krishna, to see the power of the great men, made one a woman and went to the sages and asked, o Munishreshtha! This woman is from the womb, tell us who will be born from her womb? The sages came to know that this child had brought a man to them, making them a woman
 muniyon ne krishna ke prapautron ko shrapa ki is maanav ke garbh se ek moosal likalegaa jisase tumhaare vansh kaa ant hoga
 Krishna's great-grandchildren rubbed that pestle on a stone and threw it into the river and threw its tip
 us churna se utpann vriksh kii pattiyon se sabhi krishna ke praputra mrityu ko praapt kiye
 Seeing this, Shri Krishna also sat meditating under a tree
 'zaraa' naam ke ek vyaadh ne apane baan kii nok par moosal kaa nok laga diya tathaa bhagwaan krishna ke charankmal ko mrug samajhakar us baan se prahaar kiya
 The kiss of Krishna's feet by that arrow caused his paramdham to go
 prabhu apane sampurna sharir ke saath golok prasthaan kiye
 The sea then submerged Dwarkapuri in its waters
 tadnantar dwarka se laute hue arjuna ke mukh se yadavon ke sanhaar kaa samachar sunakar yudhisthir ne sansar kii anityata kaa vichaar karke parakshit ko rajasan par bithaaya or draupadi tathaa bhaaiyon ko saath le himalay kii taraf mahaprasthaan ke path par agrasar hue
 Except Yudhishthira in that Mahapath, all fell one by one
 ant main yudhisthir indra ke rath par arudh ho bhaaiyon sahit swarg ko chale gayi
