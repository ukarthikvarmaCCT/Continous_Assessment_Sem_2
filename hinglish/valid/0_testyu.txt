 mona lisa ) leonardo da vinci ke dwaara krit ek vishwa prasiddh chitra he
 This is a depiction of a thoughtful woman with a very light smile
 yah sansar kii sambhavat: sabase prasiddh painting he jo painting or drushya kala kii paryaay maani jaati he
 It is believed that the Italian painter Leonardo da Vinci created this picture called Mona Lisa between 1503 and 1506
 ye tasviir florence ke ek gumnaam se vyapaaree 'francesco del jeeyocondo' kii patni 'lija gherardini' ko dekhakar banaai gai he

 Monalisa is the immortal artwork of the legendary Italian artist Leonardo de Vinci painted by Vinci between 1503 and 1507
 It took Leonardo four years to create this painting, although during this time he was baptized by St
 Paul and the Virgin and Child with St

 The classic artist Leonardo da Vinci, who created the artwork, was born in 1452 in a small town called Vinci, in the east of Florence, Italy
 inke pita sar piyaren da vinci ek notary the
 Seeing Leonardo's keen interest in art since childhood, the father sent him to Paris for higher education in art
 jo ki us samay kala shiksha kaa ek pramukh kendra tha, yahan rah kar ve ek berakia ke studiyon main kala kii shiksha lene lage
 While staying here, Leonardo gained extensive knowledge of painting from his guru and became aware of its specifics
 sheeghra hi guru ne mahasoos kiya ki unka shishy unase bhi kahin guni va pratibhavan he, atah guru ke paas jitna bhi gyaan tha, apane shishy vinci ko de diya
 In addition to painting, Leonardo also specialized in engineering, study of human anatomy
 rhite bandhuon ke janm se saikadon varsh pehle jab hawaii jahaaj kii kalpana bhi mushkil thi tab liyanardo ne hawa main udne vaali mashin kaa model banaaya tha
 With the passion to understand the complex structure of the human body, Leonardo would dig into the cemetery from the cemetery in the darkness of night and bring it to the studs
 maanav sharir ke aantarik angon ko katate va unki draning banaakar vistrut nots likhte
 These historical sketches and comments are still preserved today, so Leonardo has made hundreds of paintings and drawings in his life, some of which are names of famous works of art, the more fame the masterpiece Monalisa got on Da Last Supper, Madonna Inn, etc
 Hai, he is really amazing

 newland kaa vishwaas he ki monaalisa ne apane pet main pal rahe bachche kii smriti va anusansha se apana chitra banwaaya tha
 His statement is that because of the thrill of new life coming into the world and the happiness that pulverizes motherhood, it is this unique and wonderful smile on his face

 In 1550, a photograph of Lisa Silkardini, the wife of a silk merchant, was named Mona Lisa by the famous biographer, George Vasari, a resident of Italy of renaissance carpet artists

 However, the woman depicted in this artwork has also been known by her other nickname Laziocande until centuries later

 According to Pallanati, the houses of Leonardo's father Sir Pierre and Francisco were not far apart, but the two families had close relations
 us samay lija kii aayu 24 varsh thi
 While Monalisa's mysterious smile has remained a mystery for centuries, German art historian Ms
 Maik bogt-lairesen has claimed that the woman seen in the photograph is Ishabella, wife of Duque of Arango Prefecture, Italy
 sushri mike ke anusaar ishabela kii muskaan main dukh he kyonki liyanardo ke painting banane se kuch samay pehle hi uski maan kaa dehant ho gaya tha
 Ishakella's drunken husband would often beat and beat her after getting drunk
 apni prakashit pustak ‘hu ij monaalisa ’ insearch main anekon samantaanen ginvaayi hai
 The book further states that Leonardo, who was a royal artist in the court of Duque, was very close to Isabella
 kareeb 8 varsh purv japan main daanton ke ek doctor ne yah kah kar sabko hairat main daal diya tha ki monaalisa kii rahasyamayi muskaan kaa raaj uske upree jabade main aage ke do daanton kaa tutaa hona he or isi kaaran uske upree hoth ek taraf kuch dabaa hua-sa dikhaai de rahaa he, isi kaaran uskaa ek upree hoth ek taraf se kuch dabaa hua sa dikhaai de rahaa he
 This is why Monalisa and the mysterious smile appear in the unknown when it is not really a smile but an attempt to push the lips from the tongue with its broken teeth so that the lips do not look pressed
 yah doctor pichley kai varshon se monaalisa par shodh kar rahe the
 In December 1986, Ms
 Lillian Swadze, a computer scientist at Bell Laboratories in the US, created a world-wide buzz on the basis of her research, saying that Leonardo Vinci's famous artwork Monalisa is not a mysterious woman but her own self-portrait of a painter
 art and entics naamak patrika main prakashit lekh main sushri lilian ne daawa kiya ki 1518 main laal chaak se bane linordovinci kaa aatmachitra va monaalisa ke chitra ko jab usne paas-paas rakhaa to yah dekhakar dang rah gai ki liyanardo tathaa monaalisa ke chehre, ankhen, gaal, naak va baalo main adbhat samanta he
 With the help of a computer, she was completely transformed into Leonardo when she was seen wearing Leonardo's hair, beard, and hair on top of Monalisa's face
 iske vipareet liyanardo ke chehre se yadi dadhi, bal, munch, bhave aadi hataa di jaye to liyanardo monaalisa main badal jate he
 Sword ji states that Leonardo has portrayed himself as Monalisa
 unhone iske peeche ek kalakaar kaa samalangik hona pramukh kaaran bataaya he
 There is a strong possibility that Vinci is gay and is interested in adapting bisexual themes into the artwork and due to this trend he portrayed himself as a woman and named her Monalisa

 Jainism is one of the oldest religions in India
 'jain dharm' kaa arth he - 'jin dwaara pravartit dharm'
 Those who are followers of 'jin' are called 'jain'
 'jin' shabd bana he 'ji' dhaatu se
 'zi' Mane - Winning
 'jin' maane jeetne vaala
 Those men who conquered their mind, conquered their speech and conquered their body and attained specific knowledge and attained omnipotence or perfection are called the men of men called Jineshwar or 'jin'
 jain dharm arthath 'jin' bhagavan kaa dharm
 Ahimsa is the basic principle of Jainism
 jain darshan main srishtikarta kan kan swatantra he is sashti kaa yaa kisi jeev kaa koi karta dharta nahi he
 All living beings enjoy the fruits of their own actions
 jain dharm ke ishwar karta nahi bhogata nahi wo to jo he so he
 Ishvarakritikar Ishwar is not given a place in Jainism
 jain granthon ke anusaar is kaal ke pratham tirthankar rishabhdev adinath dwaara jain dharm kaa pradurbhaav hua tha
 Many references to Jainism's very antiquity are abundant in non-jain literature and especially Vedic literature
 jain ishwar ko maanate hai jo sarv shaktishaalee trilok kaa gyaata drashtaa he par trilok kaa karta nahi | jain dharm main jin yaa arihant or siddh ko ishwar maanate hai
 After the completion of the age of Arihanto and Kevalyanis, when they get free from birth and attain nirvana, then they are called Siddha
 unheen kii aradhana karte hai or unheen ke nimitt mandir aadi banavaate hai
 According to Jain texts, Arhat Dev has described the world as eternal by the expectation of a material new world
 jagat kaa na to koi karta he or na jeevon ko koi sukh dukh denevaala he
 According to their own actions, living beings get happiness and sorrow
 jeev yaa aatma kaa mul swabhaan shuddh, buddha, sachchidanandmay he, keval pudgal yaa karm ke aavaran se uskaa mul swarup aachhadit ho jaataa he
 At the time when this plant load is removed, the soul attains the higher state of God
 jain mat 'syadwad' ke naam se bhi prasiddh he
 Syadvad means polytheism, that is, relative acceptance of different religions, such as continualism and impermanence, resemblance and disharmony, sattva and asattva, eligibility and indescribability in the same substance
 is mat ke anusaar akaash se lekar deepak paryant samast padaarth nityatv or anityatv aadi ubhay dharm yukt he
 There are 24 Tirthankaras considered in Jainism
 tirthankar dharm tirth kaa pravartan karte he
 There are 24 Tirthankaras of this period - rishabhdev, arishtanemi aadi tirthankarasn kaa ullekh rigvedadi main bahulata se miltaa he, jisase yah swatah siddh hota he ki vedon kii rachana ke pehle jain-dharm kaa astitv bharat main tha
 Vishnu Purana mentions Sri Rishabhdev, Manusmriti's first Jin Skandpuran, Lingapuran, etc
, the twenty-second Tirthankara Arishtanemi
 diksha murti-sahasranam, vaishampayan sahasranam mahimna stotra main bhagwaan jineshwar va arhant kah ke stuti kii gai he
 In Yoga Vashishta, Shriram wishes for peace like the 'jin' God
 isi tarah rudrayamalatantr main bhavani ko jineshvari, jinamata, jinendra kahkar sambodhan kiya he
 In Nagar Purana, the fruit of giving food to a Jain sage in Kali-yuga is said to be equivalent to feeding ten Brahmins in Kritayuga
 antim do tirthankar, parswanath or mahavir swami aitihaasik purush he
 The birth of Mahavira is dated to 599 years before Christ
 shesh ke vishay main anek prakaar kii aloqik or prakrutiviruddh kathaayen hai
 The story of Rishabhdev has appeared in many Puranas etc
 and they are counted in 24 incarnations of Hindus
 mahabharat anushaasan parv, mahabharat shantiparv, skandh puraana, prabhas puraana, lankavatar aadi anek grantho main arishtanemi kaa ullekh he
 In Jainism, non-violence is considered to be the ultimate religion
 sab jeev jeena chaahate hai, maranaa koi nahin chahta, atev is dharm main pranivadh ke tyaag kaa sarvapratham upadesh he
 It is not only the killing of the souls, but also the untruthful speech which hurts others, is also described as a part of violence
 mahavir ne apane bhikshuon ko upadesh dete hue kaha he ki unhen bolte-chaalate, uthte-baithte, sote or khate-pite sadaa ytnsheel rahanaa chahie
 Attachment is a violence in the works of rituals, so conquering the disorders, suppressing the senses and narrowing all your instincts is called true non-violence in Jainism
 prithvi, jal, agni, vaayu or vanaspati main bhi jivan he, atev prithvi aadi akendriya jeevon kii hinsa kaa bhi is dharm main nishedh he
 The second important principle of Jainism is karma
 mahavir ne baar baar kaha he ki jo jaisaa acha, bura karm karata he uskaa fal avashya hi bhogana padataa he tathaa manushya chaahe jo praapt kar saktaa he, chaahe jo ban saktaa he, isaliye apane bhagya kaa vidhaataa vah swayan he
 In Jainism, God is not considered to be the doer of the world, through austerities etc
, the Supreme state of self-development has been described as God
 yahan nity, ek athwa mukt ishwar ko athwa avatharavaad ko sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 With the destruction of these eight deeds of knowledge, sight-seeing, altariness, infatuation, age, name and gotra, when the creature is freed from the bondage of karma, then he becomes God and due to being freed from raga-malice, that creation Does not fall into the greatness of jaindharm main jeev, pudgal, dharm, adharm, akaash or kaal naam ke chha: dravya maane gaye hai
 These matter are found in Lokakash, there is only sky in Alokakash
 jeev, ajeev, asrav, bandha sanvar, nirjara or moksh ye saat tatv he
 Adoration of these elements leads to attunement
 samyagdarshan ke baad samyaggyaan or phir vrath, tap, sanyam aadi ke paalan karne se samyakcharitra utpann hota he
 These three gems have been described as the path of salvation
 ratnatray kii purnataa praapt kar lene par moksh kii prapti hoti he
 On salvation, the organism is freed from the bondage of all actions, and due to the upward movement, it is situated on the siddhashila in the front of the world
 use anant darshan, anant gyaan, anant sukh or anant veery kii prapti hoti he or vah antkaal tak vahaan nivas karata he, vahaan se lautakar nahin aata
 Anekantavada is the third main principle of Jainism
 ise ahimsa kaa hi vyapak rup samajhnaa chahie
 The subject of misunderstanding of the rage, of the rites, to understand the vision of another properly, is the name of pluralism
 isse manushya satya ke nikat pahunch saktaa he
 According to this theory, no belief or principle can be said to be completely true
 prayek mat apni apni paristhitayon or samasyaon ko lekar udbhoot hua he, atev prayek mat main apni apni visheshtaayen hai
 The polytheist proceeds by coordinating them all
 aage chalakar jab is siddhant ko taarkik rup diya gaya to yah syadwad naam se kaha jane laga tathaa, syat asti', 'syat naasti', syat asti naasti', 'syat avaktavy,' 'syat asti avaktavy', 'syat naasti avaktavy' or 'syat asti naasti avaktavy', in saat bhaagon ke kaaran saptabhangi naam se prasiddh hua
 Jainism emphasizes self-purification
 aatmshuddhi praapt karne ke liye jain dharm main deh-daman or kshtshishnutaa ko mukhya mana gaya he
 The ascetic Mahavir used to roam in a naked state due to being silent and impassive
 yah bahya tap bhi antarang shuddhi ke liye hi kiya jaataa tha
 It is said in ancient Jain sources that even if someone remains in a naked state or fasts for a month, but if he has maya in his mind, he is not going to get perfection
 jain aachaar-vichaar ke paalan karne ko 'shuron kaa maarg' kaha gaya he
 Just as chewing iron gram, eating sand of grass, crossing the sea with arms and walking on the edge of a sword is difficult, the conduct of the discourse is also said to be incurable
 buddha dharm kii bhanti jain dharm main bhi jatibhed ko sweekaar nahin kiya gaya
 The ancient Jain texts state that the true Brahmin is the one who has conquered raga, malice and fear and who has control over his senses
 jain dharm main apane apane karmon ke anusaar hi brahman, kshatriya, vaisya or shudra kii kalpana kii gai he, kisi jati vishesh main utpann hone se nahin
 Mahavira had initiated many mlechha, thieves, bandits, fishermen, prostitutes and Chandalputras into Jainism
 is prakaar ke anek kathanak jain granthon main paae jate hai
 All the Tirthankars of Jainism took place in the Kshatriya clan
 isse maaloom hota he ki purvakaal main jain dharm kshatriyon kaa dharm tha, lekin aajkal adhikansh vaisya log hi iske anuyaayi hai
 By the way, how many Jains do farming business in South India like Setwal etc
 panchamon main brahman, kshatriya or vaisya in teenon varnon ke dhandhe karanevaale log paae jate hai
 Except for the followers of the Jinsen Math, the followers of any monastery are not called ivs
 chaturth log saadharantaya kheti or jameendaari karte hai
 In Satara and Bijapur districts, many followers of Jainism practice julaha, chhupi, tailor, goldsmith and kasare etc
 jain granthon main saat tattvon kaa varnan miltaa hai
 These are jain dharm main shravak or muni donon ke liye paanch vrath bataae gaye he
 The great men who follow the Tirthankaras are called Mahavrata - muni in vraton kaa sookshm rup se paalan karte he, vahi shravak sthool rup se karte he
 According to Jain texts, Jiva and Ajiva are the two main substances
 asrav, bandh, sanvar, nirjara, moksh, punya, paap ajeev dravya ke bhed hai
 According to Jainism, folk is made up of 6 liquids
 yah 6 dravya shaashvat hai arthath inako banaaya yaa mitaayaa nahin ja saktaa
 This is Jiva, Pudgal, Dharma, Unrighteousness, Akash and Kaal
 yah ratnatray aatma ko chhodkar anya kisi dravya main nahin rahata
 There are eight parts of Samyaktva - Disarmament, Discontinuity, Nirvikikitsattva, Amodrishtitva, Upabhumna / Upaguhana, Situation, Influence, Vatsalya
 krodh, maan, maaya, lobh yah chaar kashay he jinke kaaran karmon kaa asrav hota he
 There are four speeds in which the birth of a worldly creature continues to die - Deva pace, human speed, three-speed, hell speed
 moksh ko pancham gati bhi kaha jaataa he
 Name deposit, installation deposit, liquid deposit, sentiment deposit
 ahimsa or jeev dayaa par bahut jor diya jaataa he
 All Jains are vegetarian
 anekaantwaad kaa arth he- ek hi vastu main paraspar virdohi anek dharm yugalon kaa sweekaar
 Syadvad means the rendering of many religions that are objectified by different expectations
 jain dharm kaa param pavitra or anadi moolmantra he- That is to say hello to the Arihants, hello to the Siddhas, hello to the Acharyas, hello to the Upadhyas, hello to all the Sadhus
 ye panch parameshthi hai
 Just as Kaal is divided in Manvantar kalpa etc
 in Hindus, similarly Kaal in Jain is of two types - Utsarpini and Awasarpini
 avasarpini kaal main samyavadhi,har vastu kaa maan,aayu,bal ityadi ghatata he jabaki utsarpini main samyavadhi,har vastu kaa maan or aayu, bal ityadi badhata he in donon kaa kaalmaan das krodacrodi sagaropam kaa hota he arthath ek samaychakra bees krodacrodi sagaropam kaa hota he
 Each Tirthankara, 12 Chakravarti, 9 Baldev, 9 Narayana and 9 Pratinarayana are born in each Utsarpini and Awasarpini
 inhen tristh shlakapurush kaha jaataa he
 The 24 Tirthankaras counted above belong to the present Avasarpini
 prayek utsirpini yaa avasarpini main nae nae jeev tirthankar hua karte hai
 With the teachings of these Tirthankaras, Ganadhar people make twins
 ye hi dwadashang jain dharm ke mul granth maane jate he
 How ancient Jainism is, cannot be said exactly
 jain grantho ke anusaar jain dharm anadikaal se he
 Mahavir Swami or Vardhaman attained nirvana 527 years before Christ
 isi samay se peeche kuch log visheshkar european vidvan jain dharm kaa prachlit hona maanate hai
 The Jains have divided their texts into Agam, Purana etc
 pro jecobi aadi ke aadhunik anveshanon ke anusaar yah siddh kiya gaya he kii jain dharm buddha dharm se pehle kaa he
 The antiquity of Jainism is also found from the inscriptions of Udayagiri, Junagadh etc
 hindu granth, skanda puraana ke anusaar: "rishabhdev nabhiraj ke putr the, rishabh ke putr bharat the, or inke hi naam par is desh kaa naam "bharatvarsh" padaa"| In Indian astrology, the style of the Greeks propagated three hundred years behind the Vikram Samvat
 par jainon ke mul granth angon main yavan jyotish kaa kuch bhi abhas nahin he
 Just as the Ved Samhita of the Brahmins has a five-year age and constellations are counted from the Kritika, similarly the Jana texts are also in the scriptures
 isse unki pracheenta siddh hoti he
 After Lord Mahavira, there have been many sages and acharyas in this tradition, the main of which are- tirthankar mahavir ke samay tak avichhin rahi jain parampara isa kii teesri sadi main do bhaagon main vibhakt ho gayi : digambar or shwetambar
 Muni Pramanasagar ji has written in detail on this division of Jains in his work 'jainism and Philosophy' that Acharya Bhadrabahu knew on the strength of his knowledge that a severe famine of 12 years is going to happen in North India, so he gave all the sadhus Instructed that to avoid this terrible famine, one should travel to South India
 acharya bhadrabahu ke saath hajaaron jain muni dakshin kii ore vartmaan ke tamilnadu or karnataka kii ore prasthaan kar gaye or apni sadhana main lage rahe
 But some Jain monks stayed in North India itself
 akaal ke kaaran yahan ruke hue saadhuon kaa nirvaah aagmanuroop nahin ho paa rahaa tha isliye unhone apni kai kriyaayein shithil kar leen, jaise kati vastra dhaaran karnaa, 7 gharon se bhiksha grahan karnaa, 14 upkaran saath main rakhana aadi
 After 12 years, the sadhus who returned from the south saw all this and they explained to the sadhus residing here that you once again adopted the tradition of Tirthankara Mahavir, but the sadhus did not agree and then Digambara and Shvetambara became two sects in Jainism
 digambar sadhu vastra nahin pahante he, nagn rahete hai or sadhviyaan shwet vastra dhaaran karti hai
 In Digambar Matha, the idols of the Tirthakaras are made completely naked and they are not adorned
 digambar samudaay teen bhaagon vibhakt hai
 Shwetambars and Sadhvis and Saints wear white robes, idols of Tirthakaras are made and decorated with metal eyes, coils on the idol
 shwetambar bhi do bhaag me vibhakt he: Sthanavasi also has two parts: - digambar aacharyon dwaara samast jain aagam grantho ko chaar bhaago main baanta gaya he - Elementary Sutra - Granth accepted by all Jains pramukh jain granth hai :- Kalpasutra jain dharm ke pramukh tyohaar is prakaar hai

 The dazzling chore of this story has taken the rest of his diversified powerful world as if it were
 unke prabal prashansak or prakhar aalochak bhi amuman isi kahani ko lekar ulajhate rahe hai
 His scholarship related to subjects related to ancient literature, culture, Hindi language, contemporary society, politics, etc
 occasionally, but mention of two terms like 'turtle Dharam' and 'maresi Mohi Kuthaun' and Lekhma La like Old Hindi Except the schism of that schism has hardly reached the common reader
 vyapak hindi samaaj unki prakand vidwata or sarjanaatmak pratibha se lagbhag anjaan he
 During his brief life span of 39 years, Guleri ji did not compose any independent text but wrote a lot in retail form, wrote on countless topics and incorporating the features and forms of many genres
 unke lekhan kaa ek bada hissaa jahaan vishuddh academik athwa shodhaparak he, unki shastrajyata tathaa panditya kaa parichaayak he; vahiin, usase bhi bada hissaa unke khule dimag, maanavtaavaadi drushti or samakaleen samaaj, dharm raajnneeti aadi se gahan sarokaar kaa parichay detaa he
 This concern from the public is visible even in his academic like 'old Hindi' and research works like 'maharishi Chyavan's Ramayana'
 in baton ke atirikt guleri ji ke vichaaron kii aadhuniktaa bhi hamase aaj unke puravishkaar kii maang karti he
 Given the life span of only 39 years, the magnitude of Guleri's writings and the diversity of his subject matter and disciplines is truly awe-inspiring
 unki rachanaaon main kahaniyaan kathaayen, aakhyaan, lalit nibandh, gambheer vishyon par vivechanaatmak nibandh, shodhpatr, samikshaayen, sampadakeey tippaniyan, patr vidha main likhi tippaniyan, samakaleen sahitya, samaaj, raajnneeti, dharm, vigyaan, kala aadi par lekh tathaa vaktavy, vaidic / puranic sahitya, puraatatva, bhashaa aadi par prabandh, lekh tathaa tippaniyan-sabhi shaamil hai
 From the point of view of the generality of the subject, Guleri's writings cover all the serious subjects like religion, archeology, history and philology and light subjects like Kashi's sleep
 vishyon kaa itnaa vaividhya lekhak ke adhyayan, abhiruchi or gyaan ke vistaar kii gavaahi detaa he, to har vishay par itani gaharaai se samakaleen pariprekshya main vichaar apane samay or nae vichaaron ke prati uski sajagata ko rekhaankit karata he
 Born in a family of Raj astrologers, duly initiated in all the rituals of Hinduism, this stereotypical reality may not match the image of the Tripundhari devout Brahmin, but it is natural for him to raise his voice against the regressive tendencies in the era of socio-political-literary excitement
 Was
 yah yaad rakhana zaruri he ki ve rudhiyon ke virodh ke naam par keval aankh muundakar talwaar nahin bhanjte
 Along with the refutation, they also adorn the right and the appropriate
 kintu dharm, samaaj, raajnneeti or sahitya main unhen jahaan kahin bhi pakhand yaa anauchity nazar aata he, us par ve jamkar prahaar karte hai
 His ideological transparency, depth and foresight in this sequence are proved by the fact that most of the issues raised by him and his criticism are relevant even today
 unke lekhan kii rochakata uski praasangikta ke atirikt uski prastuti kii anokhi bhangima main bhi nihit he
 Like many other essayists of that era, in the writings of Guleri ji, fun and sense of humor flow continuously in one end
 dharmasiddhanth, aadhyatm aadi jaise kuch ek gambheer vishyon ko chhodkar lagbhag har vishay ke lekhan main yah vinod bhav prasangon ke chunaav main bhashaa ke muhaavaron main uddharanon or uktiyon main baraabar zankrut rahata he
 Where criticism is more penetrating, this humor turns into satire - as in articles related to education, social, stereotypes and politics, Guleri ji's works sometimes tickle, sometimes shrug and keep the reader's interest occupied
 guleri ji kii style mukhyatah vaartalap kii style he jahaan ve kissabayani ke lahaze main maano sidhe pathak se mukhaatib hote hai
 It was a period of decorating the dialect as a literary language
 atah shabdaawalee or prayogon ke str par samrasya or parimarjan kii kahin-kahin kami bhi nazar aati he
 Somewhere they use obsolete Sanskrit words like 'pagrishni', 'krishti' and 'agamighra', while elsewhere they use the typical lingua franca words like 'ber', 'bichhoda' and 'pant'
 angrezi arabi-farsi aadi ke shabd hi nahin puure-ke-puure muhaavarey bhi unke lekhan main tatsam yaa anudit rup main chale aate hai
 But this mixed form of language and tone of conversation has brought an informality and intimacy in his writing
 haan guleri ji apane lekhan main uddhran or udhaaharan bahut dete hai
 These quotes and examples usually make their narrative more clear and interesting, but in many places it also demands from the reader the knowledge of the background and context of the example, so much knowledge of ancient Indian poetry, Western literature, history etc
 from the common reader
 It is wrong to expect
 isliye yah atirikt ‘prasanggarbhatv’ unke lekhan ke sahaj rasaswad main kahin-kahin avashya hi baadhak hota he
 However, whatever the shortcomings in Guleriji's expression, his positive contribution in the development of Hindi language and vocabulary cannot be ignored
 ve khadi boli kaa prayog anek vishyon or anek prasangon main kar rahe the-shaayad kisi bhi anya samakaleen vidwaan se kahin badhkar
 Literature mythology, history, science, linguistics, archeology, religion, philosophy, politics, sociology, etc
 The subjects of their language were naturally creating scope for many applications and genres
 vah vibhinn vishyon ko abhivyakt karne main hindi kii sakshmata kaa jivant pramaan he
 In every context, their language remains intimate and alive, even if it becomes more complex or more light at some places
 guleri ji kii bhashaa or style unke vichaaron kii abhivyakti kaa madhyam maatr nahin thi
 It is an authentic document of a prudent mind standing on the era and also the mindset of that era
 isi ore ingit karte hue pro namvar singh kaa bhi kahana he, ‘‘guleri ji hindi main sirf ek nayaa gadhy yaa nayi style nahin garh rahe the balki ve vastutah ek nayi chetana kaa nirmaan kar rahe the or yah nayaa gadhy nayi chetana kaa sarjanaatmak saadhan he
 '' apane or aadhuniktaa’ samakaleen saamaajik, raajnneetik or dharmik sthitiyon se unke gambheer judaav or inase sambaddh unke chintan tathaa pratikriyaaon main spasht hoti he
 His concern was not only with the linguistic and literary movements of his time, but from every side of the life of that era
 kisi bhi prasang main jo sthiti unke maanas ko aakarshith yaa uttejit karti thi, us par tippanee kiye bagaiyr ve rah nahin pate the
 These comments testify to his concerns, sharpness and openness of vision
 anek prasangon main galleri ji apane samay se itnaa aage the ki unki tippaniyan aaj bhi hamen apane chaaron ore dekhne or sochane ko majboor karti hai
 In the era of recognition of 'khogege hoge hoge badge', Guleri ji considered sports as a strong medium of education
 bal-vivaah ke virodh or stri-shiksha ke samarthan ke saath hi aaj se sau saal pehle unhone balak-balikaon ke swasth charitrik vikaas ke liye sahashiksha ko aavashyak mana tha
 All these today we may find interesting facts of history to the urban people, but in the context of the entire country, in the atmosphere of illiteracy and superstition spread here, the words of Guleri ji are still relevant and relevant
 bharatvasiyon kii kamazoriyaan kaa ve lagaataar zikr karte rahete hai-visheshkar saamaajik raajnneetik sandarbhon main
 One reason for our degeneration is mutual disruption - "this continent is a box of cats running to bite each other"
 The caste-system is also our biggest weakness
 guleri ji sabase man kii sankeernata tyagkar us bhavy karmkshetra main aane kaa aahvaan karte hai jahaan saamaajik jati bhed nahin, maansik jati bhed nahin or jahaan jati bhed he to kaary vyavastha ke hit 
 They consider untouchability against Sanatan Dharma
 arthhin karmkandon or jyotish se jude andhvishwaason kaa ve jagah-jagah zordaar khandan karte hai
 They consider only religious religion as external religion and do not associate religion with rituals and connect it with history and sociology
 dharm kaa arth unke liye ‘‘saarvajanik pritibhav he’’ ‘‘jo sampradayik irshyaa-dwesh ko bura maanata he’’ 
 According to him, liberality, harmony and humanism are the essence of religion and it is very important to recognize this fact - "nowadays, it is necessary to have a liberal religion that will be practiced by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Muslims, Krishans in one sense and in this sense of fraternity
 Generate, but narrow religious education 


 will widen the gap between us
 ’’ 
 Guleri ji was not connected to religion with equal rituals, but with ethics, public welfare and public service

 The fact of Israel being made of Pakhtuns is also found in the book "magazane Afghani" written during the period of Jahangir in the seventeenth century AD
 angrez lekhak or yatri alexander burns ne apni bukhaaraa kii yatraaon ke bare main san 1835 main bhi pakhtunon dwaara khud ko bani israel maanane ke bare main likhaa he
 Although Pakhtun calls himself Israel, but religiously, he is a Muslim, not a Jew
 alexander bern ne hi punah 1837 main likhaa ki jab usne us samay ke afakhaan raja dost mohammad se iske bare main poocha to uskaa jawaab tha ki uski praja bani israel he isamen andeh nahin lekin isamen bhi andeh nahin ki ve log musalmaan hai evam aadhunik yahudiyon kaa samarthan nahin karenge
 William Moorecraft also wrote in the travelogue of many countries including India, Punjab and Afghanistan between 1819 and 1825 that the color of Paktuns, nose-map, body etc
 is like all Jews
 je bi freizer ne apni 1834 kii 'faras or afghanistan kaa aitihaasik or varnankaree vrittant' naamak kitaab main kaha ki pakhtun khud ko bani israel maanate hai or islam apnaane se pehle bhi unhone apni dharmik shuddhta ko barkaraar rakhaa tha
 Joseph Fierre Ferrier wrote in his book of Afghan history in 1858 that he was forced to consider the Pakhtuns as Beni Israel when he came to know that when Nadir Shah passed from Peshawar before India-conquest, the chief of the Yusufzai clan He presented him with a Bible written in Hebrew and many articles used in ancient worship

 Classical symptoms of acute myocardial infarction include sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, nervousness, sweating, and anxiety
 Women may experience less specific symptoms than men, usually shortness of breath, fatigue, indigestion, and weakness
 Nearly a quarter of all myocardial infarcts are "inactive" without chest pain or other symptoms

 The phrase "heart attack" is sometimes used incorrectly to describe sudden cardiac death that may or may not result in acute myocardial infarction
 a heart attack differs from this, but may be the cause of complete cardiac arrest that prevents heart palpitations and abnormal heartbeat arrhythmias
 It is also different from heart failure, in which the heart is unable to pump; Severe infarction may cause heart failure, but it does not have to be
 2007 main ek aam sahmati ke dastauez ne rodhgalan ko mukhya rup se paanch prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya he: Symptoms in myocardial infarction usually begin slowly for several minutes and rarely occur suddenly
 Symptoms of acute myocardial infarction are common in chest pain and often feel a sensation of grip, pressure, or squeeze
 Chest pain due to endemic anemia of the heart muscle is called angina pectoris
 Pain is usually most common in the left arm, but pain may spread to the lower jaw, neck, right arm, back, and epigastric region, where it can act as a heart burn
 Levine sign, in which the patient feels chest pain by folding in the ureter, is generally considered a future indicator of cardiac chest pain, although a prospective observational study showed that it had a weak positive prospective indicator value

 Bizarre reports from women and adult patients counterparts have more symptoms than men and youth
 Symptoms are more reported in women than men
 Among the most common symptoms of MI in women are dyspnea, weakness and fatigue
 Fatigue, sleep disturbances, and dyspnea are often found to be symptoms that can be up to a month long before the actual clinically manifest ischemic event
 Coronary ischemia is less likely to occur due to chest pain in women than men

 The rate of heart attack associated with rapid use is high, it is mental stress or physical exertion, especially if the exertion is intense compared to the normal exertion of the individual
 Quantitative, extreme exertion and eventual convalescence are associated with physically fit people with an infarction of about 6 times higher rate
 The rate difference is 35 times higher for physically challenged people
 An increased mechanism for this phenomenon has been observed to be arterial pulse pressure stretching and arterial relaxation with each heartbeat seen with intravascular ultrasound, a mechanical increase of "shear stress" on the possibility of atheroma and plaque rupture

 Some investigators have noted that circadian measurements have the potential to further increase platelets, although they have not been proven to be causal
 atheroslerosis ke liye jokhim kaarak rodhgalan ke liye aam kaarak hai: Many of these risk factors are variable, which is why many heart attacks can be prevented by maintaining a healthy lifestyle
 Physical activity, for example, is associated with a low risk profile
 Non-variable risk factors include age, sex, and history of premature heart attacks in the family, which is reflected as a genetic predisposition

 Inflammation in term disease can be associated with coronary heart disease and because periodontitis is common, it could have been great for public health
 Studies of serological subjects found antibodies against antibodies levels to be typical of bacteria caused by periodontitis, although antibodies are more present with coronary heart disease
 Eriodontitis is a habit of cytokines and, in the midst of increased blood pressure levels to fibrinogen CRP, thus, may have an MI effect on other risk exposures through periodontitis factors
 Predictive research suggests that periodontal bacteria can promote the aggregation of platelets and further promote foam cell formation

 Acute myocardial infarction refers to a subtype of acute coronary syndrome, called non-st high myocardial infarction and ST high myocardial infarction, which is a manifestation of and most frequent of coronary artery disease
 The most common triggering event is an atherosclerotic coronary epicardial plaque resulting in total occlusion of the artery, which leads to a clot, which cascades into an atherosclerotic coronary epicardial plaque
 Atherosclerosis in plaques in the arterial wall is the gradual development of cholesterol and fibrous tissue, usually over decades
 Blood flow column irregularities are seen on angiography that reflect a narrowed arterial lumen and are the result of decades as atherosclerosis advances
 Plaques may become unstable, diffuse, and in addition promote a clot that innervates the artery; It can happen in a minute

 Injured heart tissue builds up electrical impulses more slowly than normal heart tissue
 Differences in conduction velocity between injured tissue and fine tissue may promote re-entry or develop an outcome that is thought to be the cause of multiple lethal arrhythmias
 The most severe of these arrhythmias is ventricular fibrillation, a very rapid and chaotic heart rhythm that is the main cause of sudden cardiac death
 Another risk of arrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia, which may or may not cause sudden cardiac death
 However, the result of ventricular tachycardia usually results in a faster heart rate which effectively prevents the heart from pumping blood
 This can cause cardiac output and blood pressure to dangerous levels, which may further lead to coronary ischemia and infarction

 In popular law, myocardial infarction is usually a disease, but sometimes an injury can also occur
 This has an impact on non-fault insurance schemes such as worker compensation
 a heart attack does not usually involve this, however, it can be a work-related injury if it results from, for example, abnormal emotional stress or abnormal mental stress
 In addition, in some jurisdictions, a person working in certain occupations, such as a heart attack caused by a police officer, is classified by law or policy as duty-of-line
 In some countries or states, a person who has previously had myocardial infarction may be prevented from participating in an activity that threatens the lives of others, for example driving a car or flying an airplane

 Suheldev is a semi-mythological Indian king from Shravasti
 kaha jaataa he ki inhone 11veen shatabdi kii shuruyaat main baharich main gazanvi senapati saiyad salaar masood gaazi ko parajeet kar maar daalaa tha
 He is mentioned in the historical fictional tale mirat-e-masudi of the 17th-century Persian language
 20veen shatabdi ke baad se, vibhinn hindu rashtravaadi samoohon ne unhen ek hindu raja ke rup main chihnit kiya he jisane muslim akramanakariyon ko haraa diya
 The legend of Salar Masood and Suheldev is found in the mirat-i-masudi of the Persian language
 yah mughal samraat jahangir ke shasankaal ke dauraan abd-ur-rahamaan chishti ne likhi thi
 According to legend, Suheldev was the eldest son of the king of Shravasti
 puranic kathaon ke vibhinn sanskarnon main, unhen sakardev, suhirdhvaj, suhridil, suhridaldhvaj, raay suhrid dev, susaj or suhaardal samet vibhinn naamon se janaa jaataa he
 At the age of 16, Syed Salar Masood Ghazi, nephew of Mahmud Ghaznavi, invaded India by crossing the Indus River and conquered Multan, Delhi, Meerut and finally Satrikh
 satrikh main, unhone apane mukhyalay kii sthapana kii or sthaneey raajaaon ko haraane ke liye senaaon ko bhej diya
 Syed Saif-ud-din and Mian Rajab were sent to Bahraich
 baharich ke sthaneey raja or anya padosi hindu raajaaon ne ek sangh kaa gathan kiya lekin masood ke pita saiyad salaar sahu gaji ke netritv main sena ne unhen haraa diya
 Nevertheless, he continued to rage and so in 1033, Masood himself came to check his progress in Bahraich
 suheldev ke aagaman tak, masood ne apane dushmano ko har baar haraaya
 Finally in 1034, Suheldev's army defeated Masood's army in a battle and Masood was killed
 masood ko baharich main dafnaaya gaya tha or san 1035 main vahaan uski yaad main ek dargah banaai gai thi
 The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh claims that the place formerly had an ashram of the Hindu saint and sage Balark and was converted into a dargah by Firoz Shah Tughlaq
 vibhinn jati samoohon ne suheldev ko apane aap main se ek ke rup main darshane kaa prayaas kiya he
 According to mirat-e-masudi, Suheldev belonged to the "bhar Tharu" community
 baad ke lekhakon ne unki jati ko "bhar rajput", rajbhar, tharu or jain rajput rup main varnit kiya he
 In 1940, a local school teacher from Bahraich composed a long poem

 1950 or 1960 ke dashak ke dauraan, sthaneey rajanetaaon ne suheldev ko paasi raja bataanaa shuru kiya
 Pasi is a Dalit community and also has a significant vote bank around Bahraich
 dhire-dhire paasi ne suheldev ko apni jati ke sadsy ke rup main mahima mandit karnaa shuru kar diya
 The Bahujan Samaj Party originally used the Suheldev myth to attract Dalit voters
 baad main, bhartiya janata party, vishwa hindu parishad or rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ne bhi daliton ko aakarshith karne ke liye iskaa istemaal karnaa shuru kar diya
 As the 1980s began, the BJP-VHP-RSS organized fairs and gimmicks to celebrate the Suheldev myth, depicting him as a Hindu Dalit who fought against the Muslim invaders

 To whom the Central Office Dhadding District was to be Sadarmukam Dhingbeshki asthisushirta yaa osteoporosis haddi kaa ek rog he jisase fracture kaa khatara bad jaataa he
 In osteoporosis, bone mineral density is reduced, bone micro-structures are disintegrated, and the amount and variety of non-stored proteins in bone is altered

 Osteoporosis is most common in post-menopausal women, when it is called post-menopausal osteoporosis, but it can also develop in men and can be caused by specific hormonal disorders and other chronic illnesses in anyone or drugs, especially glucocorticoids
 Can result when the disease is steroid or glucocorticoid-induced osteoporos Number called

 asthishoshak koshikaon dwaara asthi kaa avasorana hota he, jiske baad nai asthi asthikorak koshikaon dwaara jamaa kii jaati he
 The three major mechanisms by which bone weakness develops are insufficient head bone mass, excessive bone absorption, and insufficient formation of new bone during regeneration
 At the core of delicate bone tissue development is the interaction of these three mechanisms
 Hormonal factors specifically determine the rate of bone absorption ; Estrogen deficiency increases bone resorption and, at the same time, reduces the deposition of new bone, usually occurring in weight-bearing bones
 is prakriya ko dabaane ke liye apekshit estrogen kii maatra, aam taur par garbhashay or stan granthi ko uttejit karne ke liye apekshit maatra se kam he
 The estrogen receptor of the α-form seems to be very important in the regulation of bone manipulation

 The role of calcitonin, a hormone produced by the thyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not as important as PTH

 RANKL, RANK and OPG are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors
 Wnt sanketan maarg kii bhoomika ko sweekruti mili he, par acchhee tarah se kam samajha gaya he
 Local production of eicosanoids and interleukin is thought to be involved in controlling bone manipulation and may be the over or under-production factor of these mediators at the core of the development of osteoporosis

 The vulvascular bone is the rigid outer shell of the bones and the middle of the long bones
 kyonki asthikorak or asthishoshak, haddiyon kii sataha par nivas karte hai, bandhakmay asthi zyaada sakriy he or asthi ke her-pher or punarpratirupan ke adheen he
 Not only is bone density low, but bone micro-structures are disrupted
 bandhakmay asthi kamazor conticaayen bhang ho jaati hai or kamazor haddiyon se pratisthapit hoti hai
 Common osteoporotic fracture sites, such as the wrist, hip and spinal cord, have a relatively high ratio of vulvar bone to ligamentous bone

 Osteoporosis has no specific symptoms of its own; The main consequence of this is the increased risk of fractures
 osteoporotic fracture un sthitiyon main hote hai, jahaan aam taur par swasth logon kii haddi nahin tuutati he; atah unhen najuk asthi-bhang mana jaataa hai
 Typical delicate fractures occur in the vertebral column, rib, hip, and wrist

 Those who have fallen earlier and whose balance or balance is disturbed, they are most prone to fall
 osteoporotic fracture ke liye jokhim karkon ko gair-parivartaneey or parivartaneey ke bich vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he
 Additionally, there are specific diseases and disorders in which osteoporosis is an accepted problem
 dawa kaa prayog saidhantik rup se parivartaneey he, haalanki kai maamalon main osteoporosis ke jokhim ko badhaane vaali dawaaon kaa upyog aprihaary he
 The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age and female gender; Estrogen deficiency after menopause correlates with a rapid decrease in bone mineral density, whereas a decrease in testosterone levels in men has a comparable effect
 haalanki osteoporosis sabhi jaateey samoohon ke logon main paaya jaataa he, europea yaa asian mul ke log osteoporosis ke prati pehle se hi pravrutt hai
 People who have a family history of fractures or osteoporosis are at greater risk; The heritability of fractures and low bone mineral density is relatively high, with an expansion ranging from 25 to 80 percent
 osteoporosis ke vikaas se jude kam se kam 30 jin maujuud hai
 People who have already had a fracture are twice as likely to have a fracture again than someone who is same or gay
 haddiyon kii kamajori ke saath kai bimariyon or vikaron ko sambhddha kiya gaya he

 Osteoporosis is diagnosed by measuring bone mineral density

 In 2007, a WHO report stated that eating calcium along with acidic adulteration with diet affected bone weakness
 
 a mid-analysis of randomized controlled trials involving calcium and calcium and vitamin d supported the use of high levels of calcium and vitamin D, although the results varied depending on the criteria used to assess bone health
 a mid-analysis with another study supported significantly better outcomes for patients with best adherence to the treatment protocol

 Galileo Galilei was a scientist from Italy
 ve ek mahaan avishkaarak the tathaa doordarshee ke vikaas main unka athulaneey sahyog tha
 This great thinker was born into a musician family in the city of Pisa, modern Italy
 aadhunik italy kaa shahar pisa 15 farvari 1564 ke mahaan vaigyanik galileo gallily ke janm ko bhi ishwar kii rachana kaa dosha maanakar aitihaasik bhul kar baitha tha
 The doctrines propounded by Galileo contradicted religious beliefs, for which Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment for trespassing with divine beliefs
 inke pita vincounjo gallily us samay ke jane maane sangeet visheshgy the
 He used to play an instrument called "lute", the same instrument called lute which later evolved into guitar and banjo
 apni sangeet rachana ke dauraan vincounjo gallily ne tani huyi dori yaa taar ke tanaav or usase nikalne vaale swaron kaa gahanta se adhyayan kiya tathaa yah paaya ki dori yaa taar ke tanaav or usase nikalne vaali aawaaj main sambandh he
 The scientific study of the results of the interrelations of the sounds of the string, or the string, stretched for the music by the father, was done by his son Galileo
 is adhyayan ko karne ke dauraan balak galileo ke man main sugrahita purna prayog karte huye unke parinamo ko aatmsaat karne kii prerana pradaan kii
 He is considered the father of exam oriented science
 inhone dolan kaa sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya
 He invented binoculars
 usne doordarshee yantra ko adhik unnat banaaya
 With his help, he took many astronomical observations and supported the theory of Copernicus
 unhen aadhunik praayogic khagoliki kaa janak mana jaataa he
 He found that the laws of nature are influenced by each other's factors and there is a relation between the increase and decrease of one as in the equations of mathematics
 isaliye unhone kaha kih-‘ ishwar kii bhashaa ganit he
 'this great mathematician and scientist only dared to measure the speed of light
 iske liye galileo or unka ek sahaayak andheri raat main kai mile dur sthit do pahaad kii chotiyon par ja baithe
 From where Galileo lit the lantern, after getting his assistant's signal, they were to indicate the light through the lantern and its knock
 duusari pahari par sthit unke sahaayak ko laalaten kaa prakaash dekhakar apane paas rakhi duusari laalaten kaa khatka hataakar punah sanket karnaa tha
 Thus Galileo had to estimate the speed of light by looking at the light shining on the top of the second mountain

 In due course, Albert Einstein, the great scientist who solved the intricate relationship between the speed of light and the relationship of energy, referred to him as 'father of modern science'
 galileo dharmik pravruth ke the parantu puraani dharmik manyataon ko vivekshiltaa or prayog ke madhyam se sidv karnaa chaahate the
 In the year 1609, Galileo discovered a telescope that was invented in Holland, with the help of this telescope, one could study their motion by looking at distant celestial bodies
 galileo ne iskaa vivaran sunakar swayan aisi doorabeen kaa nirmaan kar daalaa jo holland main avishkrut doorabeen se kahin adhik shaktishaalee thi
 Based on this, through his observations and experiments, Galileo found that all the planets, including Earth, revolve around the Sun, contrary to the prevailing beliefs in the universe
 isse purv copernicus ne bhi yah kaha tha ki prithvi samet sabhi grah surya kii parikrama karte he jiske liye unhe carch kaa kopbhaajan bananaa padaa tha
 Now, based on the results based on experimentation and discretion, Galilea found it to be the same
 us samay tak yah sarvamaanya sidwant tha ki brahmand ke kendra main prithvi sthit he tathaa surya or chandramaa sahit sabhi akashiya pind lagaataar prithvi kii parikrama karte he
 This recognition was supported by the religious leaders of Tadsamay
 apane prayogon ke aadhaar par praapt parinaamon ke kaaran galileo ne puraani avadharanaon ke virudv khadey hone kaa nirnay liya
 When Galileo made this doctrine public, the Church considered it his disobedience and for this disobedience Galileo was sentenced to imprisonment on behalf of the Church
 galileo ke dwaara diye gayi vichaar ne tadsamay manushya ke chintan kii disha ke naye rup main swikaarne ko vivash kar diya
 Due to social and religious persecution, he could not stand for long with the theories, contrary to the prevailing beliefs and beliefs
 varsh 1633 main 69 varshiya vrudv galileo ko carch kii ore se yah aadesh diya gaya ki ve saarvajanik taur par maafee maangate huye yah kahen ki dharmik manyataon ke virudv diye gayi unke sidwant unke jivan kii sabase bady bhul thi jiske liye ve sharminda hai
 He did the same, but even after this he was imprisoned
 unka swasthya lagaataar bigadta rahaa or isi ke chalate karawas kii sajaa grih-kaid arthath apane hi ghar main kaid main rahane kii sajaa main badal diya gaya
 He also spent the last day of his life in this prison

 Thus, it took more than three and a half years for the Church to accept its historical error by ordering a 1633 order regarding Galileo, a great astronomer, mathematician, physicist and philosopher
 varsh 1609 main doorabeen ke nirmaan or khagoleey pindon ke prekshan kii ghatana ke chaar sau saalon ke baad 400veen jayanti ke rup main varsh 2009 ko antarrashtriya khagoliki varsh ke rup main manaakar is mahaan vaigyanik ko shradwanjali arpit kar apni bhul kaa praashchitya karne kaa prayaas kiya
