bharat main garibi bahut vyapak he kintu bahut teji se kam ho rahi he
 It is estimated that a third of the world's poorest population is in India
 2010 main vishwa bank ne soochna di ki bharat ke 32
7% log rosena kii US$ 1
25 kii antarrashtriya garibi rekha ke neeche rahete hai or 68
7% log rosena kii US$ 2 se kam main guzaaraa karte hai
 The poverty figures of the Planning Commission for the year 2009-2010 say that during the last five years, poverty in the country has come down from 37
2 per cent to 29
8 per cent
 yani ab shahar main 28 rupye 65 paise pratidin or gaanvon main 22 rupee 42 paise kharch karne vaale ko garib nahin kaha ja saktaa
 nae formule ke anusaar shaharon main maheene main 859 rupye 60 paise or gramin kshetron main 672 rupye 80 paise se adhik kharch karne vaala vyakti garib nahin he
 This may once again give rise to the controversy which started after the affidavit filed by the Planning Commission in the Supreme Court
 isamen ayog ne 2004-05 main garibi rekha 32 rupee pratidin tay kiye jane kaa ullekh kiya tha
 Analysts say that the figures set by the Planning Commission are misleading and it seems that the aim of the commission is to reduce the number of poor so that less people have to take advantage of government welfare schemes
 bharat main garibon kii sankhya par vibhinn anumaan hai
 According to official figures, 37 percent of India's population is below the poverty line
 jabaki ek duusare anumaan ke mutabiq ye aankada 77 pratishat ho saktaa he
 There has been a steady increase in the inflation rate in India
 kai vishleshkon kaa kahana he ki aise main masik kamai par garibi rekha ke aankaden tay karnaa jaays nahin he
 In May 2011, a World Bank report had revealed that the efforts of the Indian government to fight poverty are not being proved enough
 report main kaha gaya tha ki bhrashtachar or prabhaavaheen prabandhan kii vajah se garibon ke liye bani sarkari yojanaayen safal nahin ho pai hai

 The district has an area of 1736 km2 and is bounded on the north and east by the districts of Sindhudurg and Kolhapur in Maharashtra, South Goa district in the south and Arabian Sea in the west
 aaj ke uttar goa ke zyaadaatar pradesh, kabhi sawantvadi rajshahi ke adheen the, jabaki ponda samay samay par kabhi sunda rajshahi yaa maraathon yaa phir sawantvadi rajshahi ke adhikaar kshetra main rahaa
 Hence these areas were considered a safe zone for the Hindus while most of the Hindus in the area lived in a state of constant fear due to the Portuguese Inquisition
 18 veen shatabdiyon main nai vijay ke ek bhaag ke rup main portugaliyon ne in pradeshon par vijay praapt kar inhen apane samrajya main mila liya or 1961 main in kshetron par bhartiya ganraajya ke kabje se pehle tak yah portugali samrajya ke adheen hi rahe
 The Union Territory of Goa was formed by merging Goa and two other former Portuguese outlying areas
 1965 main goa ko ek jile ke rup main punargathit kiya gaya
 On 30 May 1987, Goa attained statehood and Goa was reorganized into two districts, North Goa and South Goa

 Gorichen mountain peak is a mountain peak present between Tawang and West Kameng districts in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh
 arunachal pradesh paryaton vibhaag ke anusaar kul 22,500 feet oonchaai ke saath yah purvi bharat or arunachal pradesh kii sabase unchi chotii he
 It is currently in a non-restricted area and is open to climbers and is a major tourist attraction
 kuch anya sroton ke mutabiq gorichen samooh main kul chah chotiyaan hai
 september-october is the best time for trekking and mountaineering when the monsoon rains have stopped and visibility is good

 Those masonry of stone or brick are called Raj
 or unka kaam vyapak arth main rajgiri kehalaata he, kintu vyavhaar main rajgiri shabd kaa prayog praaia: pathar kii chinai ke liye hi hua karata he
 Brick work is called brick masonry
 aadi maanav dwaara nirmit angadhi rachanaayen to shaayad aadi kal se hi banati rahi hogi, kintu pathar kaa aisa kamjise rajgiri kaha ja saktaa he, avashya hi sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath aayaa
 The oldest specimens of Rajgiri are found in temples in India and Egypt
 in pracheen sanrachanaon main se anek main bahut bade bade pathar lage hai, jinhen dekhakar aaj aashcharya hota he ki hamaare purvaj us yug main bhi saat-saat, aath-aath sau ton vajan ke pathar na keval khaanon se nikaalte the, apitu unhen bahut unche uthaakar imaaraton main bhi laga lete the
 The distinction of how all this was done is yet to be found
 ati pracheen rajgiri main praaia: hathode kii gadhaai hi milti he, chheni yaa taanki kii nahin
 The methods of forging and planting were often the same as they are nowadays; However, due to the inconvenience of transportation, small stones were often planted
 taanki kii gadhaai jab hone lagi tab to aisi kala pradurbhoot hui, jise dekhakar aisa lagata he ki vaastukala yadi pathar kii na hoti to shaayad bol hi padati
 The equipment of masonry can be broadly divided into five classes: bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke kaam ke liye bhinn-bhinn prakaar ke hathode hote hai, jaise, ghan, imarti hathaudaa, kordaar hathaudaa, nukila hathaudaa, sutaki chota hathaudaa, basuli, teshi aadi
 There are also many shapes and sizes of wooden hammers, that is, corals
 khan se nikaala hua taaja pathar garam hota he or aasaani se cat jaataa he
 Hand saws are used for cutting soft stones, such as porbandar limestone
 yah badhai ke aare jaisaa hi hota he
 There are two saw saws for cutting large blocks
 bahut bade khand dhaanchayukta aaron se kaate jate hai
 These saws are 4 feet to 15 feet long and are hung from ropes by ropes, so that the drivers do not have to bear their weight
 kaatane kaa patta sade ispaat kaa hota he, jisamen daante bane hote hai
 During harvesting, sand is added along with water
 pani snehan kaa kaam karata he or baaluu katati he
 Chisels or stitches are also of more type than a hammer, eg, small, big, serrated, flat ie flat, thick, sharp, sharp, wide, narrow, pointed, etc
 nukili taanki summaa kehalaati he
 a very large stitch is called sabbal, which does not expect hammer injuries due to its weight to some extent
 isse surang lagane ke liye kade pathar main chhed kiye jate hai
 The lifting of large stones is also taken from it
 nishanbandi tathaa sthaapan ke aujaar pathar kii chinai ke liye bhi vaise hi hote hai jaise eent chinai ke liye, yatha kanni yaa kerani, soot, sahul, gunia, gaj, paara lebill yaa talamaapi, pata aadi
 There are special types of stone lifting equipment, which are used to keep large stones in place
 doli yaa luis, chutki yaa nippers or gantri is sambandh main ullekhneey hai
 Fresh stone extracted from the mine contains plenty of juice; Therefore, it is easily fabricated
 hawa khaane par ras suukh jaataa he or pathar kathor ho jaataa he
 Unloading on the mine itself removes unwanted load and reduces the cost of transportation
 kintu yah aavashyak he ki imaarat main lagane se pehle pathar bhalee bhanti hawa kha le, jisase vah pakakar majboot ho le
 Sir Christopher Rain, the architect of the great church of Sant Pal, had laid down the condition that the stone remained uncovered on the beach for 3 years after its exit from the mine, then it would be considered fit to be in the church
 pathar jamaate samay yah dhyaan rakhana chahie ki sandhiyaan sahi sahi rakhi jaaen or sataha samtal ho
 The ridges are wide if the surface is bulging
 pathar bhi dagamagaataa rah saktaa he
 It is not appropriate to set such stones with slaughter
 sataha avatal ho to koron par jor padataa he, jisase vah chatak sakati hai or papadi ukhd sakati he
 The masonry of broken cornered stones appears to be poor
 bade bade pathar masaale main jamaane se pehle sookhe hi yathasthaan rakhkar dekh lenaa chahie ki thik baith jate hai ki nahin
 Care should be taken that the stone is not broken and the crust is uprooted, because then it cannot be repaired
 pathar sadaa is prakaar jamaana chahie ki bhaar sadaa prakritik nital par lambavat hi pade
 Thus, where only vertical loads come, the natural layers of stone should remain horizontal
 lambey khambhon aadi main lagane ke liye upyukt motaai kii tah main se katkar nikaala hua pathar chhant lenaa chahie
 Spices should be applied sparingly in the masonry, but the saddlery should not remain polly
 yadi mulaayam kism kaa pathar ho, jaise kaccha balua pathar yaa chooney kaa pathar, to kisi bhi pathar kii lambaai uski motaai ke teen gune se adhik na honi chahie
 Proper bonding is very important in Rajgiri
 sangeen chinai mento ek ek khand bhalee bhanti bandhan main rahata he
 Architecture determines the location of each of its treaties
 dhoka chinai main tode yaa dhur pathar lagaakar bandhan praapt kiya jaataa he
 The axles should be thick and wide from front to back
 aam taur se chaudaai oonchaai se dyodhi ho or diwaar kii sataha par inkaa kshetrafal saare kshetrafal ke shtak hona chahie
 These are usually planted five to five feet apart in the cancellous masonry and placed in an asymmetrical position in each junk
 jab sangeen chinai keval saamne hi saamne hoti he, to vah 4 se 9 tak gahari jaati he
 The remainder of the wall is made of brick masonry or Dhoka masonry
 praaia: isapar plasters kar diya jaataa he
 Bounded on the front, it is necessary to have proper validation in both masonry
 dhoka chinai praaia: do prakaar kii hoti he : Sometimes a few very thick stones are laid in the masonry masonry
 ise raddevar, chauras, dhoka chinai kehete hai
 The other is called Raddwar, Ungarh, Dhoka Masonry
 berdda chinai so angadh dhokon kii hi hoti he
 The bayonet masonry is also of several types according to the stonework
 pathar kii sabhi satahen taanki se bahut baarik gadhi hon or sandhiyaan 1 / 8 inch se adhik moti na hon, to vah baarik sangeen chinai kehalaati he
 If the molding is not very fine and the joints are 1 / 4 inch thick, then it is 'adhgad bayonet masonry'
 kabhi kabhi iske pattharon kii bahari satahon par baarik gadhaai karke ek hashia sa bana diya jaataa he or haashie ke bich kaa bhaag angadha hi chhod diya jaataa he
 This is called 'rough underground masonry'; But if the stones are covered in cores up to about an inch deep, that is, when killed, it becomes 'fortified bayonet masonry'
 kabhi kabhi diwaar ke siron par, yaa kabhi kabhi bich main bhi, stambhon ke rup main sangeen chinai karke shesh bhaag main angadh pattharon kii chinai ke dilhe se bana die jate hai, jiske radde sangeen chinai ke raddon se kam unche rahete hai
 This masonry of pulses is called 'pindak Masonry'
 chunki ek sthaan par laganevaali iten praaia: ek jaisi hoti hai, isliye eent chinai ke liye anek prakaar ke bandha, yaa chaalen, prayukt hoti hai
 In each move it is taken care that the standing joints do not fall on top of each other, but should be at least as far apart as one-fourth of the length of the brick
 itnaa dabaav praapt karne ke liye prayek ekantar radde main kinarevaale tode ke baad ek daily chodi jaati he jo chauthai eent ke baraabar chaudee hoti he
 Among the bandhas, that is, chalas, the most popular practice is toad-patti chal, also called English chal
 isamen todon hi todon ke or pattiyon hi pattiyon ke ek ek radde kramash: ek duusare ke baad aate hai
 Even in the cancellations of the bandages, wherever the filling is required, only the pieces are filled
 bheetar pattiyaan na bharani paden, is uddeshy se dedh, dhai, saadhe teen eent aadi kii chinai main prayek radde main ek or pattee kii chaal hoti he to duusari ore tode kii
 The second trick, which is more prevalent, is the Flemish trick
 isamen pratyek radde main ekantar kram se tode or pattiyaan rakhi jaati he
 On either side of the wall is called Flemish
 isamen bhitari sandhiyon ke kuch ansh sabhi raddon main ek duusare ke upar hi aate hai
 Therefore, it is somewhat less strong than the movement of the cart, although more visible
 kabhi kabhi majbootee or darshneeyata kaa samanvay karte hue, saamne kii or flemish or pusht main toda-pattee kii chaal chali jaati he
 This is called a single Flemish move
 aadhi eent kii diwaar main tode nahin lag sakate; at: isamen prayek radde main pattiyaan hi pattiyaan jod katkar rakhi jaati hai
 This strip is called gait
 bahut chaudee diwaar main bharti keval todon kii hi hone se, lambaai kii disha main diwaar kuch kamjor rah jaati he
 Therefore, after every three to four cancellations, in one cancellation, the bricks are slanted
 iske vikarn chaal kehete hai
 If all the bricks are made diagonally in the same direction, alternately rotating at right angles, making waves like that, then the wave moves
 eent-chinai main bhi sandhiyaan yathasambhav kam chaudee honi chahie
 First class masonry is one in which the joints are only 1 / 4 inch wide
 dwitiya shrenee kii chinai main sandhiyaan 3 / 8 inch tak moti or tritiy shrenee kii chinai main sandhiyaan asmaan or 1 / 2 inch tak moti ho sakati hai
 It should also be noted that the bricks are facing upwards so that the spices are well filled and the masonry is not polished
 anek paribhaashik shabd rajgiri main praaia: ek jaise arthon main prayukt hote hai, jaise chinai chaahe pathar kii ho yaa eent kii
 The vertical surface appearing in front of the wall is called 'saamana' and the vertical surface behind it is 'pustan'
 diwaar ke bich kaa bhaag, jo saamana or pusht ke madhya main hota he, 'bharti' kehalaata he
 The bottom surface of the stone, on which it sits in the waste, is called 'nital'
 pathar ke baahar kii ve satahen jo saamana or nital ke lambavat hoti hai, 'parshv' kehalaati he
 Horizontal joints of spices, or joints that are perpendicular to the load, are 'long joints' and the joints which are perpendicular to the long joints and faces are called 'lateral joints', or simply joints
 pathar kaa vah khand, yaa eent, jisaki lambaai saamne par lambavat padati he, 'toda' or jisaki lambaai saamne ke samaantar padati he, 'pattee' kehalaata he
 a 'stone' is one that goes from the front of the wall to the back
 'konia', yaa kone pindak, ve iten yaa khand hai jo kisi rachana main deevaaron ke baheri konon par lagate hai
 After Conia, a piece has to be applied in the cancellations of the pieces, so that if the brick is placed further, the pact is suppressed and the rise is found
 yah tukdaa 'dali' kehalaata he
 If the length of the brick is cut in such a way that the width of each section remains half of the width of the entire brick, then that section will be 'female deli', but if the width of the section is full on one side and half on the other, then it will To be called a 'male deli'
 'khanda' eent kaa aadha hota he, jisaki chaudaai puri eent kii chaudaai ke baraabar hoti he
 'slaughter' are small pieces that are used to fill the empty space inside the masonry
 eent kii ek sataha par praaia: ek gaddha bana rahata he, jisamen nirmaataa apana naam or sanwat aadi likh dete hai, ise 'dilhaa' kehete hai
 The brick reduces some weight and its spice increases its grip
 chinai kii prayek kshaitij parat, jo do kramagat nital sandhiyon ke bich main hoti he, 'radda' kehalaati he
 The specific arrangement of placing stones, or bricks, in each waste, so that they are well-interconnected, is called 'bandha or Chal'
 'kingri radda' aage niklaa hua kshaitij radda he, jiske kaaran barish kaa pani neeche kii diwaar kii sataha par bahane nahin paata
 It is usually ornamented and is applied to each roof

 'nikasa Radda' is often applied to meet some structural requirement, such as placing a dasa, etc
, by moving something out of the wall
 'munder' chat se upar yaa pul kii patan se upar uthaai hui nichi diwaar ko kehete hai
 The headpiece is the topmost radius of the wall, which is open and protects the wall below from rainwater
 apane uddeshy main safal hone ke liye sheershika kii chaudaai diwaar kii chaudaai se praaia: kuch adhik rakhi jaati he or bade hue bhaagon main neeche kii ore kabhi kabhi tota yaa tapak ban diya jaataa he, taaki pani diwaar kii sataha par na bahakar usase dur hi tapake
 Their top surface is also sometimes sloped between the two sides
 golardh, yaa kamanidaar, yaa anya anek prakaar kii katwali sheershikaaye bhi hoti hai
 The 'carnis' is an ornamented exit radius, often near the roof
 'daab radda' carnis ke upar laga hua vah radda he jo use dabaae rahata he, taaki diwaar se baahar nikali hone ke kaaran carnis palatakar gir na jaae
 a door, or mokhe, is called berglow pakha

 Shaheed Ashfaq Ullah Khan was a prominent revolutionary in the Indian freedom struggle
 unhone kakori kand main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 He was prosecuted by the British and on December 19, 1927, he was hanged to death in Faizabad jail
 ram prasad bismil kii bhanti ashfaaq ulla khaan bhi urdu bhashaa ke behtareen shaayar the
 His Urdu Takhallus, nicknamed in Hindi, was Hasrat
 urdu ke atirikt ve hindi va angreji main lekh evam kavitaayen bhi likhaa karte the
 His full name was Ashfaq Ullah Khan Warsi Hasrat
 bhartiya swatantrata sangram ke sampoorn itihaas main bismil or ashfaaq kii bhoomika nirvivaad rup se hindu-muslim ekta kaa anupam aakhyaan he
 Ashfaq Ullah Khan was born on 22 October 1900 in Kadankhail Jalalnagar locality near the railway station in Shahjahanpur, Shahidgarh, Uttar Pradesh
 unke pita kaa naam mohammad shafiq ulla khaan tha
 His mother, Mazhurunnisha Begum, was counted among the beautiful figures of Balam
 ashfaaq ne swayan apni diary main likhaa he ki jahaan ek ore unke baap-daadon ke khandaan main ek bhi graduate hone tak kii talim na paa sakaa vahiin duusari ore unki nanihaal main sabhi log ucch shikshit the
 Many of them had also been appointed to the rank of Deputy Collector and SJM
 1857 ke gadar main un logon ne jab hindustan kaa saath nahin diya to janata ne gusse main aakar unki aaleeshaan kothi ko aag ke hawaale kar diya tha
 That Kothi is still famous as Jali Kothi throughout the city
 baharhaal ashfaaq ne apni kurabaani dekar nanihaal waalon ke naam par lage us badnuma daag ko hameshaa - hameshaa ke liye dho daalaa
 Ashfaq was the youngest of his siblings
 sab unhen pyaar se achchhu kehete the
 One day his elder brother Riyasat Ullah told Ashfaq about Bismil that he is a very capable and high-ranking poet, Goya is not seen in Shahjahanpur due to arrest in Mainpuri case
 kaaphi arse se faraar he khuda jane kahan or kin halaat main basar karata hoga
 Bismil is his best classmate
 ashfaaq tabhi se bismil se milane ke liye betaav ho gayi
 Time passed 1920 main aam muaafi ke baad ram prasad bismil apane vatan shahjahanpur aaye or gharelu kaarobaar main lag gayi
 Ashfaq tried to earn his trust by meeting Bismil many times but did not succeed
 chunaanche ek roj raat ko khannaut nadi ke kinare sunsaan jagah main meeting ho rahi thi ashfaaq vahaan ja pahunche
 When Ashfaq called Amen on a lion of Bismil, Bismil called him near and asked for introduction
 yah jaanakar ki ashfaaq unke classphelo riyasat ulla kaa sagaa chota bhai he or urdu jubaan kaa shaayar bhi he, bismil ne usase arya samaaj mandir main aakar alag se milane ko kaha
 Ashfaq went to the Arya Samaj even after refusing lakhs of his family members and became a active member of his party Matriwadi after a long chat with Ram Prasad Bismil
 yaheen se unki jindagi kaa nayaa falsafa shuru hua
 Along with the poets, they also became khadmatgars of the community
 ashfaaq bahut doordarshee the unhone ram prasad bismil ko yah salaah di ki krantikari gatividhiyaan ke saath-saath congress party main bhi apni paith banaakar rakhana hamaari kaamyavi main madadgaar hi sabit hoga
 However, along with Ashfaq and Bismil, many other youths of Shahjahanpur joined Congress and gave the party power
 1921 kii ahmedabad congress main ram prasad bismil va premakrishna khanna ke saath ashfaaq bhi shaamil hue
 In the session, he met Maulana Hasrat Mohani, who was considered among the senior martyrs of Congress
 moulana hasarat mohani dwaara prastut purna swaraj ke prastaav kaa jab gandhi ji ne virodh kiya to shahjahanpur ke congressi swayamsevakon ne gandhi kii dtakar mukhaalafat kii or khub hangaamaa machaaya
 Ultimately, Gandhiji had to accept the proposal even without wanting it
 isi prakaar disambar 1922 kii gaya congress main bhi navayuvakon dwaara gandhi kii jamkar khinchaayi kii gayi
 In this, the youth of Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh became one
 un sabakaa gandhi se ek hi sawaal tha- "aapane kisase poochkar asahyog aandolan waapas liya?" After the Congress of 1922, two parties were formed in the party, one of the rich people and the other of the young men from the general section
 pehle vaale dal ne 1 janvari 1923 ko swaraj party bana lee duusare dal ne krantikari party ke gathan kaa man bana liya
 Some young men from Bengal came directly to Shahjahanpur and met the experienced revolutionary Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil of Mainpuri conspiracy and urged them to cooperate in the formation of a new party
 bismil un dinon silk kii sadiyon ke vyapaar main uljhe hue the unke paas samay nahin tha
 At this Ashfaq explained to him and pledged to cooperate fully on his behalf
 uske baad hi bismil ne apane saajheedaar banarsi laal ko sara karowar saunp diya or puure man se ashfaaq or bismil krantikari party ke kaam main jute gayi
 In view of Ashfaq's commendable role in taking the Revolutionary Review, published in English on 1 January 1925, on behalf of the party to the entire district of Uttar Pradesh, HRA Central member Yogesh Chandra Chatterjee nominated Ashfaq as Bismil's cooperative
 And putting the responsibility of the state on the shoulders of these two, went to Bengal itself
 bengal main shachindranath sanyaal va yogesh chandra chatarji jaise do pramukh vyaktiyon ke giraftaar ho jane par hindustan republican asosiyeshan kaa puraa daaromadar bismil ke kandhon par aa gaya
 In this, apart from Prem Krishna Khanna, Thakur Roshan Singh from Shahjahanpur, Ashfaq Ulla Khan's contribution was commendable
 jab ireland ke krantikariyon kii tarj par jabaran dhan chhinane kii yojana banaayi gayi to ashfaaq ne apane bade bhai riyasat ulla khaan kii licency bandook or do peti kaartoos bismil ko uplabdh karaaye taaki dhanadhy logon ke gharon main dakaitiyaan daalkar party ke liye paisa ikattha kiya ja sake
 But when Bismil planned to loot the government treasury, Ashfaq single-handedly opposed it in the executive meeting
 unka tark tha ki abhi yah kadam uthaanaa khatre se khaali na hoga; sarkaar hamen nestnabud kar degi
 On this, when all the people instead of Ashfaq, Bismil openly said, "panditji! See the act of this mother
 hamaari party main ek muslim ko shaamil karne kii jid kaa asar ab aap hi bhugtiye, ham log to chale
 "ashfaq said this -" Panditji is our leader, we cannot be equal to him
 unka faisla hamen manjur he
 We will not say anything today but tomorrow the whole world will see how a Pathan carried out this action? "and the same happened, the next day as the train moved from Kakori station on the evening of August 9, 1925, Rajendranath Lahiri pulled the chain, Ashfaq
 He placed the driver on the floor of the driver and took him in his possession and Ram Prasad Bismil dropped the treasure box down, slamming the guard on the ground
 lohe kii majboot tijori jab kisi se na tuuti to ashfaaq ne apana moujar manmathanath gupt ko pakadaaya or ghan lekar puri takat se tijori par pil padey
 As soon as Ashfaq's vault was broken, everyone saw his steely strength
 varanaa yadi tijori kuch der or na tuutati or lakhanu se police yaa army aa jaati to mukaable main kai jane ja sakati thim; phir us kakori kand ko itihaas main koi doosraa hi naam diya jaataa
 The night of 26 September 1925, when simultaneous arrests were made in the whole country, Ashfaq escaped by throwing dust in the eyes of the police
 pehle ve nepal gayi kuch din vahanrahakar kanpur aa gayi or ganeshashankar vidhyaarthee ke pratap press main 2 din ruke
 From there, through Banaras, he worked for a few days in Daltonganj, a district of Bihar, but returned to the city of Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, before the police got the idea
 vidhyaarthee ji ne unhen apane paas se kuch rupee dekar bhopal unke bade bhai riyasat ulla khaan ke paas bhej diya
 After staying there for some time, Ashfaq went to Rajasthan and stayed at his brother's friend Arjunlal Sethi's house
 sethi ji kii ladkee un par fida ho gayi or unke saamne shaadi kaa prastaav pesh kar diya
 Finally, one night, he got upset from there and reached Daltonganj in the same district of Bihar and changed his old name and started a job
 ek din bhed khul gaya to ashfaaq train pakad kar dilli chale gayi or apane jile shahjahanpur ke hi mul nivasee ek puraane dost ke ghar par tehre
 Here the same trouble followed Ashfaq
 jiske yahan tehre hue the us dost kii ladkee ne bhi ashfaaq par dore daalane shuru kar diye
 Being convinced of the situation, Ashfaq had made a plan to go abroad and meet Lala Hardayal outside Delhi, that on receiving news of a spy, Ikramul Haq, vice-chairman of Delhi Intelligence Police, arrested him
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki us dost ne hi ashfaaq ko pakadvane main police kii imadad kii thi
 It is a historical fact that the decision of Kakori scandal was heard on 6 April 1926

 Chanda is commonly used in Sanskrit poetry to describe the rhythm
 vishisht arthon main chand kavita yaa geet main varnon kii sankhya or sthaan se sambandhit niyamon ko kehete hai jinase kavy main lay or ranjaktaa aati he
 Small-scale sounds, in the order of minor-master utterances, give the volume and when in a poetic composition they harmonize with an arrangement, it is given a classical name and according to the small-master volumes this letter The system starts with a specific name called Chanda, like Chaupai, Doha, Arya, Indravajra, Gayatri Chanda etc
 is prakaar kii vyavastha main maatra athwa varnon kii sankhya, viraam, gati, lay tathaa tuk aadi ke niyamon ko bhi nirdhaarit kiya gaya he jinka paalan kavi ko karnaa hota he
 In this second sense it is equivalent to the meter of English or to the ruckus of Urdu Persian
 hindi sahitya main bhi paramparaagat rachanaayen chand ke in niyamon kaa paalan karte hue rachi jaati thim, yani kisi na kisi chand main hoti thim
 In other languages of the world also, there are traditionally rules for poetry
 chhandon kii rachana or gun-avagun ke adhyayan ko chhandashastra kehete hai
 Since 'chhandashastra', composed by Acharya Pingal, is the oldest available text, this scripture is also called Pingal Shastra
 pracheen kaal ke granthon main sanskrit main kai prakaar ke chand milte hai jo vaidic kaal ke jitne pracheen hai
 The verses of the Vedas are also chanted
 pingal dwaara rachit chhandashastra is vishay kaa mul granth he
 The verse is first discussed in the Rigveda
 yadi gadhy kii kasuti ‘vyakaran’ he to kavita kii kasuti ‘chhandashastra’ he
 Proper knowledge of the design is not without knowledge of the scriptures
 kavy ore chand ke prarambh main ‘agan’ arthath ‘ashubh gana’ nahin aana chahie
 The phrase employed with specific rules related to the number and order of the letters used in the sentence, quantity-calculation and Yeti-speed is called "chhand"
 chhandas shabd 'chad' dhaatu se bana he
 It has a metallic etymological meaning - 'one who walks on his own will'
 isi mul se svachhand jaise shabd aae hai
 Therefore, at the root of the word stanza is the sense of motion
 kisi vaaiumay kii samgr saamagree kaa naam sahitya he
 The Rigveda is the oldest of the literature found in the world
 rugveda kii rachana chandobaddh hi he
 This is a proof that even at that time, verses were used for art and special statement
 chand ko padya rachana kaa maapdand kaha ja saktaa he
 The verse plan cannot be realized in poetry without difficult practice
 chand ke nimnlikhit ang hote hai - a formula has been devised to memorize the ganas easily - Yamatarajbhansalaga
 sutara ke pehle aath varnon main aath ganon ke naam hai
 The last two letters 'L' and 'C' are the letters of the scripture
 jis gana kii matraaon kaa swaroop jaananaa ho uske aage ke do aksharon ko is sutara se le len jaise ‘magan’ kaa swaroop jaanane ke liye ‘maa’ tathaa uske aage ke do akshar- ‘ta raa’ = matara 
 The idea of 'gan' is only in the letter circle, mere verses are free from this bondage
