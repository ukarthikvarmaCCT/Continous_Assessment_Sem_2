 According to him, everyone wants to get pleasure in this life

 Sometimes you get sorrow after joy and sometimes after grief you get pleasure

 afalaatoon ke anusaar sadguni jivan purnanand kaa jivan he, yadhyapi anand swayan vyakti kaa dhyey nahin he
 According to Aristotle, all those actions which make a human being come under duty

 In the Stoic philosophy of Edmonism, worldly pleasure is considered a disease of the soul
 is rog se mukt rahakar sadgunon kaa nirpeksh bhav se seven karne par aadhyatmik anand praapt karnaa hi manushya kaa sachcha lakshya he
 In Navya Aflatuni philosophy, pleasure arising out of the imposition of God and Jiva is higher than earthly subjects
 isai darshanik agstin ne bade joardaar shabdon main ishvarsakshaatkaar se utpann anand kii tulana main sansaarik anand ko mare vyakti kaa anand mana he
 Spinoza said, "the love that arises towards the eternal and infinite element provides such joy that there is no trace of sorrow
 " emanuele kaant kaa kahana he ki sarvottam shrey is sansar main nahin praapt ho saktaa, kyonki yahan log abhaav or kaamanaayon ke shikaar hote hai
 By recognizing the inviolable rules of conduct, a person can suppress the hunger of his senses
 manushya kii ichha swatantra he
 He has some duties, so he does
 kartavya-kartavya ke liye he
 There is no other goal of duty
 nirvikaar bhav se kartavyapath par chalanevaale vyakti ko sachche anand kii prapti honi chahie, kintu is sansar main kartavyanishth vyakti ko anand kii prapti aavashyak nahin he
 Therefore, according to Kant, the real pleasure is not worldly, but the charitable pleasure resulting from duty is absolute bliss

 The fauna of the forest house is responsible for 75% of the total gross primary product of the system and 80% of the earth's vegetation is found in the forests
 Forests at different heights form different ecosystems
 Such as the boreal forest near the poles, tropical forest near the equator and temperate forest at moderate heights
 The height of an area and the moisture present there affect the trees found in that area
 Humans and forests have both positive and negative effects on each other
 Forests provide resources to humans and also provide sources of earning
 Forests also affect the health of humans
 While there is a negative impact on the forest due to human intervention
