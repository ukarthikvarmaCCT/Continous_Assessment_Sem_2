 It broadly means to have reverence for an idol, picture, statue or symbol
 shraddha yaa puja ke vichaaron ko darshane ke liye kisi bhi iken yaa chhavi ke istemaal ke virodh ko aniconism kaha jaataa he
 Destroying idols and images as a symbol of worship is called econoclasm, and has been accompanied by violence among religious groups who forbade idol worship and who have accepted signs, images and statues for worship

 The history of religions is marked with accusations and denials of idolatry

 Huh hindu dharm main, ek pratik, chitra, murti yaa murti ko murti yaa pratimaa kaha jaataa he
 Major Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Smritism grace the use of the idol
 in paramparaon kaa suzav he ki samay ko samarpit karnaa or manviki yaa gaiyr-maanavkrishnik chihnon ke madhyam se aadhyatmikta par dhyaan dena aasaan he
 Verse 12
5 contains a Hindu scripture Bhagavad-gītā, which states that it is very easy to contemplate and fix the imperishable Absolute Absolute Brahman only in time and mind, and to pay attention to the qualities, qualities and aspects
 manushya kii indriyon, bhaawanaaon or dil ke madhyam se, bhagwaan kaa ek prakat pratinidhitiv, kyonki manushya ke swaabhaavik rup se tarika he
 An idol in Hinduism, says Jeanian Fowler - is a professor of special religious studies on Indian religions, he is not a god himself, it is an "image of God" and thus a symbol and representation
 ek murti ek rup or abhivyakti he, jiskaa arth niraakaar nirpeksh he
 Thus a literal translation of the idol as an idol is mistaken when the idol itself is understood as a superstitious end
 jaise vyakti kii tasviir asli vyakti nahin he, ek murti hindu dharm main ek chhavi he, lekin asli cheez nahin he, lekin donon hi maamalon main chhavi darshakon ko bhaavnaatmak or vaastavik mulya ke bare main yaad karti he
 When a person worships the idol, it is considered to be the manifestation of the essence or soul of the deity, the spiritual thoughts and needs of the devotee are meditated on through it, yet in Hinduism it is called Brahma - the ultimate reality
 This is not the idea
 bhagwaan ke saath pyaar ke gahare or nijee bandhan kii kheti par kendrit bhakthi prathaon ko aksar ek yaa ek se adhik murti ke saath vyakt kiya jaataa he or isamen vyaktigat yaa saamudayik bhajan, jap yaa gayan shaamil hai
 Acts of devotees, especially in major temples, are structured to treat the idol as an expression of the revered guest, and in daily routine the idol can be awakened in the morning and ensure that it is "washed away
" , Dressed, and garlanded
 " In Vaishnavism, the construction of a temple for the idol is considered an act of devotion, but non-murti symbolism is also common, where the fragrant tulsi plant or saligram is an official reminder of spirituality in Vishnu
 hindu dharm kii shaiva dharm parampara main, shiv ko ek mardaana murti yaa ardh purush aadhe mahila ardhanarishwar rup ke rup main prastut kiya ja saktaa he, jo ki ling-yoni rup main aainkan main hota he

 The sculptures are neither random nor intended to be superstitious objects, but rather are designed with embedded symbolism and iconographic rules that set the style, proportion, color, nature of images, their pose and legends related to the gods is

 vibhinn bhartiya vanshon ke hindu shaskaon ne buddha dharm or hindu dharm ko chauthi se lekar 9veen shatabdi tak sangrakshit kiya, buddha chihnon or gupha mandiron jaise ajintha gufaaen or ellora gufaaen, jisamen buddha kii murtiyon thim

 isamen avahtt, auktik or pingal sheliyaan aati he
 The word Avah is not different from Apabhramsa
 addahamaan ne chaar bhashaaon kaa prayog kiya he -- avahatth, sanskrit, praakrit or pashachi
 Jyotirishwar Thakur has also enumerated "avhatta" in the list of six languages and seven dialects
 vidyapati ne is shabd kaa prayog janpriya bhashaa ke rup main kiya he
 Even if there is no such indication in the word avah, on the basis of which we consider it a later form of shoraseni, yet it can be said that it is a sign of the latter language of development of aphasia and it is also clear that it is universal Was the form
 praakrit pangalam ke tikaakar ne ise "aadya bhashaa' kaha he
 This is a statement of the same style in which Prakrit was once called Adi Bhasha
 vidyapati ne ise deshi bhashaa yaa log bhashaa ke samakaksh rakhaa
 Some poets call it "native"
 yah vastutah parinishthit sanskritprakritmay apbhransh style ke prati ek janpriya style kii pratikriya hi thi
 Both object and style began to become obsessed with the demons
 kshetra kii drushti se, yah style atyant vyapak prathit hoti he
 Abdulrahman belonged to Multan
 is kshetra kii yah prachlit bhashaa nahin, apitu yahan kii kavi- prayukt style hi avah thi
 Sandeshrasak's style is orthodox and artificial literary style
 kintu dohon kii bhashaa to ekadam hi naveen or lokbhasha kii ore ativ unmukh dikhaai padati he
 Dr
 Harivallabh Bhayani considered the language of the couplets to be similar to or even more pre-eminent language-condition than the couplets mentioned by Hemachandra
 aisa prathit hota he ki kavi parinishthit style kii sanrachana ko grahan karke chalanaa chahta he
 In which the tools of Sanskrit and Prakrit are assembled
 saath hi vah bich- bich main aise dohon ko anusyut kar detaa he, jo lokastyle main prachlit the
 This characteristic of the style of these popular couplets was always appearing
 kathy kii prakruti ke anusaar bhi dohon kii style bhinn ho sakati he
 The style of folklore has been used to express the tender and tender feelings of love
 "sandeshraasak' main bhi dohon kaa prayog bhav- dravit sthalon par hi hua he
 The style of these couplets is very much based on Brajbhasha
 avah style purvi anchalon main bhi lokapriy thi
 The East Zone works received in this style include Vidyapati's "keertilatha", spontaneous commendations, songs of siddhas and couplets
 vidyapati ne to "avahtt' ko sweekaar hi kiya he
 The coordination of some eastern forms is natural in this defiance
 kintu kirtilata kii bhashaa kii prakruti or sanrachana avah kii hi he
 Vidyapati makes a conscious use of the Avah language style in the context of Rajasthani
 yahi ek rudh or parinishthit style ke prabhaav- kshetra kii vistruti kaa kaaran he
 Vidyapati uses the lingua franca in love affairs and geology
 bhashaa kaa yah duharaapan ek seemaa tak abdul rahamaan main bhi miltaa he
 The repetition of language is also available in Siddha literature
 sidhon dwaara rachit dohon main pashchimi apbhransh kaa apekshaakrit shuddh prayog miltaa he
 In the individual moments of song-composition, the Siddha-poet leans towards the local forms of the Eastern languages, whether the original structure of the genre is of later abrasions or defiance
 brajabuli kaa aadhaar bhi avah hi he
 Thus Avah is coordinated with local influences from Gujarat to Bengal, Assam, Orissa
 avah style ek ore to vidyapati kii rajashrith, prashastimulak rachanaaon main prayukt milti he, duusari ore sidhon ke doha koshon main bhi avah kii chaaya milti he
 The same gets infected in the "brajbuli" style when the Vaishnava movement is present
 is sankraman kii sthiti main pashchimi apbhransh ke rup kam hone lagate hai or maithili or bangala ke sthaneey rup adhik ubharne lagate hai
 The forms of Brajbhasha emerged a long time ago, but its reputation as a style lagged behind
 apbhransh main brajabhasha ke rup to lakshith kiye ja sakate hai, par style kii drushti se apbhransh hi prachlit thi
 The verses compiled by grammars, literature, rulers and hymns may have been popular
 inaki bhashaa parinishthit apbhransh kii apeksha, jan pravaah se sambhddha hone ke kaaran, kuch aage kii vikaas sthiti kaa parichay dene vaali he
 Hemachandra has reported the popular and popular apostolic styles
 graamy apbhransh shisht yaa "nagar' apbhransh kii tulana main hi graamy thi
 When Prakrit was cast in a predetermined style, indigenous distinctions of apostrophe were pointed out
 shauraseni yaa pashchimi apbhransh ek vyapak style ke rup main parinishthit hui, tab apbhransh ke graamy yaa kathy rupon ke deshgat vaividhya dhyaan aakarshith karne lage ? jise hemchandra ne graamy- apbhransh kaha, use kaashi ke damodar pandit ne "ukti' naam diya
 In terms of grammaticalization, the definition of language and grammatical distinction was pure from the scientific point of view, but the physical abrasion seems to be a folk style, which resembled the civil style
 auktik style, chaahe loksahitya se ubharkar upar aane kii soochna detii ho, chaahe shisht style main lok prachlit rupon ke prayog kii, par vah he -- ek sahitya main prayukt style
 The use and collection of popular folk duos reinforces both possibilities
 pandit logon kii drushti main anpadh auktik rup khatkate honge! pamarajanon kii loksaahitiyik uktiyaan unhen tilamila bhi detii hongi ! par, prayogshil pravritiyaan unako prashray dene lagi hongi ! inke dwaara vyaktigat vaishishty siddh hota hoga ! swabhaavatah is lokastyle ke anek deshgat bhed bhi honge
 While the style of the established apabhramsa was seeking its patronage to seek royalty, there was also a tradition of the right style, even if it was weak
 kalkram main pehali style shithil hoti gai or duusari shakti sangrahit karti gai
 The biggest power of utterance-style of literature is to be near public interest
 ukti kaa lekhak bhugolic drushti se kosal- avadhi kshetra kaa he
 Nevertheless, it gives an introduction to the medical forms of Madhya Pradesh
 madhyadesh kaa yah purvi anchal puraani panchali style ke kshetra se asambaddha nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The said person case was composed in the eastern region, but other religious works were done in the rajasthan-gujarat region
 pashchimi hindi yaa braji kii put is style main hona swaabhaavik he
 The word utterance is the narration of the common man's dialect or proverb, compared to the Pingal style
 pingal jaisi parinishthit shaileyon ke saath iskaa sashastitv maananaa chahie
 It was not a language-dialect, it was only a folk style, its area is determined on the basis of the compositions received from Rajasthan - Gujarat to Kosala, but in other areas also the folk style must have been composed
 is style main rajashrith style yaa ucch saahitiyik style jaisi kritrimata nahin he
 The justic style was not globalized
 isaki mul parinti lokokti yaa niti- sahitya main hui
 In the Vaishnava era, the reputation of folk language, style and literature can be traced only to the original nature of the octave
 lok main jahaan shringaaroktiyaan dohon ke rup main prachlit thim or jinka upyog "sandesh-raasak' jaisi kritiyon main bhi hua, usee prakaar nitiparak lokoktiyon ke rup main bhi padya yaa padyakhand prachlit the, jinaki prerana bhavi niti- sahitya main pratifalit hui
 According to Dr
 Chatterjee, Avah was known as Pingal in Rajasthan
 dow tesitori ne rajasthan ke purvi bhaag kii bhashaa ko pingal apbhransh naam diya he
 According to him, dialects like Mewati, Jaipuri, Alavi etc
 are considered in the area related to this language
 purvi rajasthan main, braj kshetreey bhashaa style ke upkarnon ko grahan karti hui, pingal naamak ek bhashaa- style kaa janm hua, jisamen chaaran- parampara ke shreshth sahitya kii rachana hui
 This name has been mentioned by many Baran poets of Rajasthan
 pingal shabd rajasthan or braj ke sammilit kshetra main viksit or chaarnon main prachlit braji kii ek style ke liye prayukt hua he
 Pingal is associated with Shorseni Apabhramsa and its intermediate region
 surajmal ne iskaa kshetra dilli or gwalior ke bich mana he
 Thus there was no compulsory attachment of this word with Rajasthan
 yah shabd brajabhasha- vaachak ho gaya
 Gurugovind Singh's quirky drama finds the language Pingal Di

 Both pingle and dingle are names of genres, not languages
 dingal isse kuch bhinn bhashaa style thi
 It was also developing in the barns itself
 iskaa aadhaar pashchimi rajasthani boliyaan prathit hoti he
 Pingal was probably more refined than Dingle and Brajbhasha had more influence on it
 is style ko avahatth or rajasthani ke mishran se utpann bhi mana ja saktaa he
 Compositions like Prithviraj Raso enhanced the pride of this style
 raso kii bhashaa ko itihaaskaaron ne braj yaa pingal mana he
 Pingal was in fact a poetic style based on Braj Bhasha: it was not a public language
 isamen rajasthani or punjabi kaa put he
 It is also blended with Prakrit or Apabhramsa forms in view of the vigorous style
 is style kaa nirmaan to praakrit pangalam ke samay ho gaya tha, par iskaa prayog chaaran bahut peeche ke samay tak karte rahe
 Foreign words were also used in this style
 is parampara main kai raso granth aate hai
 The Pingal style got infected in devotional literature
 is sthiti main ospurn sandarbhon kii vishesh sanrachana ke bhaag hokar athwa purvakaleen bhashaa sthiti ke avshisht ke rup main jo apbhransh ke dvitv yaa anya rup milte the, unamem hraas hone laga

 Rasul Khuda Silli Allah alaihi ala wasallam has also pointed towards the same thing: namaaz or haj-o-tawaaf ko is liye vaazib qaraar diya gaya he taaki zikr khuda muhaqqiq ho sake Shaheed Mahirab, Imam Mutqeen Hazrat Ali Alaihi Assalam falsaf-e-namaz, narrates this: kudaavand alam ne namaaz ko is liye vaazib qaraar diya he taaki insaan takbbur se paak-o-pakiza ho jaenmaz ke zariye khuda se qareeb ho jaao
 Prayer makes the sins fall from human beings in the same way as dry leaves fall from the procession, Namaz frees humans in such a way that animals are freed by opening the rope from their neck Hazrat Ali Razi Allah Anna hazarat fatima zaharaa salaam allaah alaiha masjid nabavi main apane tarikhi khutabaa main islamic dasto raat ke falsafaa ko byaan faramaate hue namaaz ke bare main ishaara farmaati pain: Khudavand Alam gave a reasonable agreement to Namaz so that humans could get pak-o-pakiza from kibar-o-takbabur and Khud Beeni hisham bin hukum ne imam jaafar sadiq alaihi assalaam se sawaal kiya : namaaz kaa kya falsafaa he ki logon ko kaarobaar se roak diya jaay or un ke liye zahamat kaa sabab bane? imam alaihi assalaam ne is ke jawaab main faramaaya: Many of the prayers have been one of them, one of them is that the first people were free and were disillusioned with the memory of God-o-rasool and during their time there was only the Qur'an, Ummat Muslima was also like Gujatha Ummah because they only gave the deen He had kept the command and left the book and anbaya-e-a and used to cut them to death
 nateeja main in kaa deen purana ho gaya or un logon ko jahaan janaa chahie tha chale gaye
 Khudavand Alam intended that he should not hold the Ummat Deen in order, so on this Ummat Muslima, he gave a proper agreement to the Namaz so that he would remember the prayer five times every day and his Ism would bring 7 taboos on the tongue and remember the prayer of this prayer Do it so that it is not confusing and this god is not argued imam raza alaihi assalaam falsafaa-e-namaaz ke silsilaa main yun faramaate hai: The reason for the Namaz being reasonable, the self-respect of Khudavand Alam and the virtue of his grace, Shirk's nafi and human self-standing with khushu-o-khuzu in Alam's bargah
 namaaz gunahon kaa etr or guzashata gunahon se talab afav or tauba he
 Sajda, have to keep a face on Khakavand Alam's tajim-o-takrim namaaz sabab banati he ki insaan hameshaa khuda kii yaad main rahe or use bhuule nahin, nafarmaani or sarkashi naa kare
 With khushu-o-khuzu and rugbat-o-shaukab, you should seek enlargement in your worldly and splendid part
 is ke ilaava insaan namaaz ke zariya hameshaa or harvaqat khuda kii bargah main haazir rahe or uski yaad se sarshar rahe
 Prayer prohibits the sins and forbidding the evil of Sajda islamic haq ke ilaava ki jo muslmaan islam kii vajah se ek duusare kii gardan par rakhte hai ek doosraa haq bhi he jis ko insaani haq kha jaataa he jo insaaniyat kii bina par ek duusare kii gardan par he
 He has to thank one of the human rights, the love of others and the righteousness and favor, if i am not a Muslim
 dusron ke ehsanaat or nekiyaan hamaare upar shukr yae kii zimmedaari ko id karti hai or ye haq tamaam zabaanon, zaaton, millaton or mulkon main yakasaan or musavi he
 As much as Lutf and Nekhi, and as much as Nekim, who is good-natured, Venus should be equally high and better
 kya khuda se zyaada koi or hamaare upar haq rakhata he? nahin
 That is because its values are our top ranks and the existence of this itself is also an exercise and exercise
 kudaavand alam ne ham ko ek zarre se takhliq kiya or jo chiz bhi hamaari zaruriyat-e-zindagi main se thi jaise, nur-o-roshni, haraarat, makaan, hua, pani, aaza-o-javareh, guravaz-o-kavaay nafsaani, vasia-o-ariz kaaynaat, paude-o-nabataat, haivaanaat, abil-o-hosh or aatfaa-o-muhabbat vakaira ko hamaare liye faraaham kiya
 Sent anbaya-e-alaihim to Aslam for our Ma'anvi Tarabiyat, did iqh for the righteous Bukhti and Sa'adat, disputed in halal-o-haram
 hamaari maaddi zindagi or ruhani hayaat ko har tarah se duniyavi or ukhrvi saadat hasil karne or kamaal kii manzil tak pahunchane ke vasile faraaham kiye
 More than God, who has done righteousness and favor with us, more than this, the right to be paid and decorated for Venus
 insaani vazif or hamaari abil-o-vajadaan hamaare upar laazim qaraar detii hai ki ham us kii in nimaton kaa shukr adaa karen or un nekiyon ke shukrana main uski ibaadat karen or namaaz adaa karen
 Since he is our guardian, so let us also pray for him and only stay captive and not become a slave of mashriq-o-maghrib
 namaaz khuda kii shukraguzari he or sahib vajadaan insaan namaaz ke vaazib hone ko druk karata he
 When a dog is given a lie in exchange for a bone that is given to him and shakes his tail and attacks it if a thief or a stranger enters the house, then if a human is careless and innocent of all the bad habits of the family If you are pained and bereft of the spirit of Venus, which is lit
 in the face of prayer, is not such a person battered and inferior to the dog in appreciation and entitlement
 prati din kii paanchon samay kii namaazon ke sivaa kuch anya namaazen hai, jo samoohbaddh hai
 The first namaz is that of Jummah, which is recited in place of Zuhr, the interminable prayer of the sun

 It is that festival of Muslims, which is called Eid in Urdu and is observed on the second day of the day when the new moon comes out after fasting for the whole month of Ramadan

 in dinon ke avasaron par nishchit namaazon kaa samay suryoday ke ananthar lagbhag baarah baje din tak rahata he
 These prayers are read like normal prayers
 vibhinnata keval itani rahati he ki inamen pehali rachaat main teen baar or duusari rachaat main pun: teen baar adhik kaanon tak haath uthaanaa padataa he
 The Imam of the Namaaz gives the Khutba, in which the preaching of righteousness and goodness are kept
 kuch namaajen aisi bhi hoti hai jinke na padhane se koi musalmaan doshi nahin hota
 The most important of these prayers is the Tahajjud Namaz
 yah namaaz raatri ke pichley pahar main padhi jaati he
 Even today many Muslims strongly recite this Namaz
 islam dharm main namaaz jinaaza kaa bhi bahut mahatv he
 Its has been prayed
 jab kisi musalmaan kii mrityu ho jaati he tab use nahala dhulaakar shwet vastra se dhak dete hai, jise kafan kehete hai or phir jinaaza ko masjid main le jate hai
 There the Imam stands behind Jinaza and the others stand in line behind him
 namaaz main na koi jhukta he or na sijada karata he, keval haath baandhakar khadaa rah jaataa he tathaa dua padhata he
 Butane is a hydrocarbon
 yah ek alken he
 The relation of language philosophy to these four central problems - the nature of meaning, language usage, language cognition, and the relationship between language and reality
 kintu kuch darshanik bhashadarshan ko alag vishay ke rup main na lekar, ise tarkshastra kaa hi ek ang maanate hai
 In India, the idea of the philosophical and enlightened aspects of language started from far ancient times
 vyakaran kii rachana ke liye anek paribhaashik shabdon kaa aashray lenaa padaa
 Different forms of language were analyzed through words such as name, famous prefix, nipat, verb, gender, vow, inflection, suffix etc
 gaharaa chintan, sookshm vichaar or satya ke anveshan kii paddati ko darshan kaha jaataa he
 For this reason, language analysis also got the level of philosophy
 vaidic sahitya main hi is str ko swar milanaa armbh ho gaya tha
 The sage of Gopath Brahmin asks, asking- ye prashn bhashaa kii aantarik mimasaa ko sambodhithi hai
 If these questions are answered, then the entire grammar-view appears
 jab dhaatu, pratipadik, naam, aakhyaat aadi ke prati jigyaasa thi to inkaa samaadhaan bhi kiya gaya tha or samaadhaan karne vaale aacharyon kii lambi parampara bhi khadi ho gai thi
 The Niruktakar Yask, while presenting the details of name, eminent etc
, has mentioned the opinions of certain preachers
 isse spasht ho jaataa he ki is desh main vyakaran kii darshanik-prakriya isa se kai sau varsh purv vikaas ke ek unche str ko chhu chuki thi
 Regarding the form of the words prefix and name, Yask has also mentioned the conflicting opinions of his predecessors Acharya Gargya and Shaktaayan in his Nirukta
 isi nirukt main uddhrut2 ek acharya audumbrayan ke akhandvakyavishyak vyakarandarshan ke pramukh evam aadharbhoot siddhanth kaa ullekh bhartruhari ne vaakyapadiya main, tathaa bharatmishra ne sphotsiddh main kiya he
 Yudhishthir Mimansak considers the time of Oudumbarayan Acharya to be 3100 years pre- or somewhat earlier
 shabdanityatv ke siddhanth par pratishthit sphotwad naamak siddhanth kaa sambandh panini se purvavarti acharya sphotayan se mana jaataa he
 Sphotayan Acharya has been mentioned by Panini on the formula 'avagh Sphotayanasya'
 hardutt ne spaphotayan shabd kii vyakhya is prakaar kii he- Yudhishthira Meimansak considers the time of the Sphotayan Acharya as 3200 Vikram
 kintu jaise panini ke purv ke vyakaranshastra kii bahut hi alp saamagree aaj uplabdh he vaise hi purvaacharyon ke vyakaran-sambandhi darshanik vichaar bhi alp hi surakshit rah paae hai
 Just as the syllabic form of Sanskrit grammar begins with Panini, similarly the grammatical form also begins with Panini
 yadhyapi panini ne ashtaadhi kii rachana shabdanushasan ke nimitt kii thi kintu apni vyakaranrachanapaddati ke kaaran unhen anek paribhaasha-sutron kii rachana kerani padi
 Many nouns had to be formed and symptoms of terminology had to be given
 ham dekhte hai ki acharya ke isi awantarapratipaadan main vyakarandarshan kii ek vistrut prishthbhumi swayan taiyaar ho gai
 Hundreds of words such as divination, method, order, abrogation, subhuman, gender, adverb, chronology, vipsa, countertransference, gesture, semantics used by Panini symbolize that he was fully aware of the philosophical promises of those days and himself was of the highest order
 The philosophers were thinkers
 unke anek sutara apane aap main ek darshan hai
 As an example, we can look at the following formulas: - sach to yah he parvarti bhashadarshan chintakon ke liye panini pramanbhoot acharya hai
 Subsequent grammars have endorsed some ideas related to grammar to Panini's formulas in some way
 vyakarandarshan se sambaddh sabhi mat panini kii manyataon se paripusht kiye jate hai
 There is a quote from an ancient teacher, which is in some scriptures and whatever is in the talks, it is all in the formulas

 Different aspects of politics are studied under political theory
 raajnneeti kaa sambandh manushyon ke saarvajanik jivan se hai
 In traditional studies, thinking was the predominance of the method of thinking in which not all the elements are monitored, but on the basis of reasoning power, all its possible aspects, mutual relations effects and consequences are considered
 'siddhanth' kaa arth he tarkpurna dhang se sanchit or vishleshit gyaan kaa samooh
 Politics is concerned with many things, including the relationship between individuals and groups and classes and the state, and the institutions of the state like judiciary, bureaucracy etc
 raajnneetik siddhanth kii paribhaasha karte hue david veld kehete hai- Political theory according to Andrew Hacker's definition - guld or colb ne raajnneetik siddhanth kii ek vyapak paribhaasha karte hue kaha he ki 'raajnneetik siddhanth raajnneeti vigyaan kaa ek up-kshetra’ he, ‘jisamen nimnlikhit kaa samavesh haih We can conclude that political theory is basically concerned with the mobilization of the state in both philosophical and empirical terms

 The questions that are asked are as follows: What is the nature and purpose of the state? How do we decide the goals, goals and methods of political organization? What is and should be the relationship between the state and the individual? Throughout history, political theory has been answering these questions
 ise isliye mahatvapurn mana gaya he kyonki manushya kaa bhagya is baat par nirbhar hota he ki shaskaon or shasiton ko kis prakaar kii pranali praapt ho paati he or jo pranali praapt hoti he uske falswaroop kya saamaanya bhalaai ke liye sanyukt kaarywahi kii jaati he
 Philosophy consists of all the thinking on any subject in search of truth and knowledge
 jab vah khoj raajnneetik vishyon par hoti he tab use ham raajnneetik darshan kehete hai
 Therefore, there is no need to propose any theory in it and this is the difference between political philosophy and political theory
 is prakaar raajnneetik siddhanth raajnneetik darshan kaa hissaa he, lekin raajnneetik darshan adhikanshtah kaaphi adhik vyapak hota he or aavashyak nahin ki usamen koi siddhanth shaamil ho
 Thus we can say that the questions related to political philosophy state, government, politics, freedom, justice, property, rights, law and the enforcement of legal code by any authority, etc
, ie what are they? If they are needed then why? What things legitimize a government, what rights and freedoms it should protect and why and what form it should take and why the law is and what it is and the duty of citizens towards a legitimate government, if any What are the questions and when will the overthrow of a government be valid or not? ‘raajnneetik darshan’ se bahudhaa hamaara taatpary raajnneeti ke prati saamaanya drushtikon yaa uske sambandh main vishisht naitikta athwa vishwaas yaa rukh se hota he or yah sab jaruri taur par darshan ke sampurna takneekee vishay ke antargat nahin aata he
 Political philosophy is often concerned not with contemporary questions, but more universal questions of the political life of man
 lekin raajnneetik siddhantkaar kii drushti mukhya rup se samakaleen raajnneetik jivan par hoti he or yadhyapi rajya ke swaroop or prayojan or isi prakaar ke saamaanya prashnon kii vyakhya karne main vah dilchaspee letaa he tathaapi vah raajnneetik vyavhaar, rajya tathaa nagarikon ke bich ke vaastavik sambandh or samaaj main shakti kii bhoomika ke yathaarthon kaa varnan karne or unhen samajhane kii bhi koshish kar rahaa hota he
 While studying political science we feel that we should supplement political theory with the study of political philosophy otherwise it seems barren and irrelevant
 raajnneetik siddhanth ko kabhi-kabhi raajnneetik chintan ke paryaay ke rup main dekha jaataa he, lekin yah samaj lenaa jaruri he ki unka arth aavashyak rup se ek hi nahin hota
 Political thought is a generalized phrase that incorporates all the thoughts, principles and values of an individual or group of people or community on questions related to the state and the state
 jab koi vyaktiμchaahe vah professor, patrkaar, lekhak, kavi, upanyaaskaar aadi jo bhi ho yaa beshak vah raajnneetijna hi hoμaise vichaar vyakt karata he jinka hamaare jivan se sarokaar he or jo vichaar rajya or shashan tathaa inase sambandhit prashnon ke bare main hai tab vah vastutah raajnneetik chintan kar rahaa hota he
 Principles may or may not be included in his thoughts
 un vichaaron main tab koi siddhanth nihit nahin hoga jab un main rajya or shashan aadi ke raajnneetik niyam se sambandhit aitihaasik tathaa raajnneetik sanghatana kii vyakhya karne ke liye prastut kii gai koi vyavasthit or tarksmmat prakkalpana na ho
 In this way, political thinking is always the general idea of a person or a group politically, whereas a political theory is an explanation or idea or principle in itself and standing on its own, in which to answer questions, to interpret history
 And an attempt is made to forecast future possible events
 beshak, yah siddhanth hameshaa kisi ek chintak vyakti kii sristi hota he
 Barker had said that political thought is the inward philosophy of an entire era, but political theory is the thinking of one person
 raajnneeti vigyaan adhyayan kaa ek vistrut vishay yaa kshetra he or raajnneetik siddhanth uskaa ek up -kshetra bhar he
 Political science includes all these things: political thought, political theory, political philosophy, political ideology, institutional or structural framework, comparative politics, public administration, international law and organization etc
 kuch chintakon ne raajnneeti vigyaan ke vigyaan paksh par bal diya he
 He says that when political science is studied as a science through scientific methods, then political theory cannot be considered political science to the extent it is a part of political philosophy, because in political science, then, the abstract and intuitive There is no place for conclusions or thoughts arising out of it, but political philosophy should be filled with the same inexact methods

 raajnneetik siddhanth na to shuddh chintan he, na shuddh darshan or na shuddh vigyaan
 The questions that have been important in political theory have changed over time
 clasiki or praarambhik raajnneetik siddhanth kaa sarokaar naitik drushti se dosha-rahit raajnneetik vyavastha kii talash se tha or usne vishesh dhyaan rajya ke swaroop or prayojan, raajnneetik satta ke upyog ke aadhaar or raajnneetik avagya kii samasya se prashnon par diya
 The rise of modern nation states and the changes in the economic structure and the industrial revolution led to new priorities and the center of attention became individualism and freedom of the individual and its relationship with society and the state
 adhikaar, karttavya, swatantraaa, samanta or sampatti jaise prashn adhik mahatvapurn ho gaye
 Gradually, the interpretation of the relation of others with a concept such as freedom and equality, justice and liberty, or the relation between equality and property: also became important
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad ek nae prakaar ke anubhavik raajnneetik siddhanth kaa udai hua
 It tried to study the political behavior of man and draw theoretical conclusions on the basis of it
 maanav-vyavhaaron kaa adhyayan karne vaale vidwaanon ne adhyayan ke liye nae prashnon ko saamne rakhaa
 He often borrowed such questions from other branches of the genre
 inamen se kuch prashn is prakaar hai- Over the past few decades many other issues have emerged - such as identity, gender, environmentalism, ecology, community, etc
 saath hi mulya-aadhaarit raajnneetik siddhanth kaa bhi punaroday hua he, jisamen swatantraaa, samanta or nyaay ke prashnon par nae dhang se jor diya gaya he
 We as human beings live together as social beings, in which we partner in resources, jobs and rewards
 saath hi ham vyakti bhi hai, jis haisiyat main hamen kuch buniyadi maanavadhikaron kii jarurat he
 Therefore, the process of organization of the state and society becomes important for the sake of bringing harmony and prosperity to the maximum extent and to provide favorable conditions for personal self-improvement
 faltah maanav samaajon kii ekta or akhandta kaa yaa samaaj kii samuhik aavashyaktaaon kii purti kaa maarg prashast karne ke liye raajnneetik siddhanth mahatvapurn ho jaataa he, kyonki vah samasyaon kaa adhyayan karne or us prakriya main unka samaadhaan foundne kii koshish karata he
 The relevance of political theory in developing different perspectives on the nature and purpose of the state, in relation to the basis of political power and the most credible form of government, and in relation to the basic rights of the state and the individual
 Contains
 iske atirikt, raajnneetik siddhanth raajnneetik rajya kii naitik gunvattta kii parakh ke liye naitik maapdand sthapit karne tathaa vaikalpik raajnneetik prabandhan or vyavhaar sujhane kaa bhi praytn karata he
 In short, the relevance of political theory lies in the following: yah bhi yaad rakhana chahie ki kam se kam vartmaan kaal main rajya adhikadhik pariman main garibi, bhrashtachar, janaadhiky or sanjateey tathaa nasli tanaavon, paryaavaran pradooshan aadi kii chunautiyon kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 Apart from these, there is the problem of international differences etc
 raajnneetik siddhanth samaaj ke raajnneetik jivan kii vartmaan tathaa bhavi samasyaon kaa adhyayan karne or un samasyaon ke samaadhaan ko sujhane kaa praytn karata he
 David Heldney has said that the work of political theory is very serious because of its complexities, because in the absence of systematic study, there is a danger that politics should not remain in the hands of ignorant and selfish people as a means to satisfy their power hunger
 Go is prakaar yadi hamen samazorthik yatharth evam aadarshon tathaa raajnneetik darshan kaa dhyaan rakhte hue, rajya ke swaroop or prayojan tathaa shashan kii samasyaon par vyavasthit dhang se vichaar karnaa he to hamen samasya ke saidhantik adhyayan kaa rasta apnaanaa hoga
 Thus political theory is relevant
 saath hi vyaktigat str par raajnneetik siddhanth kaa adhyayan karne se hamen apane adhikaron tathaa karttavyon kii jaankaree milti he or garibi, hinsa, bhrashtachar aadi samazorthik yathaarthon or samasyaon ko samajhane main sahaayta milti he
 Political principles are also important because on the basis of various political principles, 'moving forward, he can suggest us ways and directions to change the society, so that an ideal society can be established
 marxvaadi siddhanth ek aise siddhanth kaa udhaaharan he jo na keval disha sujhata he balki samtawadi samaaj kii sthapana ke liye kranti kii himaayat karne kii had tak jaataa he
 If any political theory is correct then it can be communicated to the common people and then it can become a strong force to take society and mankind on the path of progress

 Digital signals can be of many types, but binary digital signals are most commonly used
 shunya / ek, on / of, haan / nahin, lo / hai aadi binary sanketon ke kuch udhaaharan hai
 Digital electronic has become very important ever since integrated circuits have emerged and millions of electronic devices are being loaded into a small chip
 aadhunik vyaktigat computer tathaa cell-phone, digital camera aadi digital electronic kii dein hai
 Numerical electronics, or microtubule numerical method, is a system that represents electrical signals as a series of separate strips, rather than as a continuous band of linear levels
 is pattee ke sabhi str sanketon kii ek hi avasthaa ko darshaate hai
 Because of this separation of signals, relatively small changes in the level of linear signal due to the construction tolerance do not leave a separate cover
 jiske parinaam swarup sanketo kii avasthaa ko mahasoos karne vaala paripath inhe nazarandaaj kar detaa he
 In most cases the number of signal states is two and these two states are represented by two voltage levels: one and the other depending on the supply voltage in use
 1 is at high level and 0 is at low level
 aksar ye donon str "lo" or "hai" ke rup main pratinidhitiv karte hai
 The basic advantage of the numerical technique is based on the fact that instead of reproducing a continuous series of signals, it is easier to send the electronic device to a known state of signals such as 0 or 1
 digital electronics aam taur par logic gates ke vrihad sangyojan va bulian tark prakaarya ke saral electronix se banaaya jaataa he
 One of the advantages of using a numerical circuit compared to a linear circuit is that signals are not disrupted due to noise and can be easily sent and displayed

 Most digital engineers are careful in selecting computer programs with a compatible file format
 prativedan ke liye ejeeniyar digital system ke prakaaron par vichaar karte hai
 Most digital systems are divided into "combinatorial systems" and "sequential systems"
 sangyojan pranali main hameshaa jo input diya jaataa he vahi output vah detaa he
 It basically represents the set of logic processes and which has already been discussed
 anukramik pranali input ke rup main daale gaye output ke saath ek sangyojan pranali he
 This allows the digital machine to operate operationally
 sabase saral anukramik pranali shaayad ek flip flop he, ek yantrawali jo ki ek binary ank yaa "bit" kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Sequential systems are often designed as state machines
 is tareeke se ejeeniyar ek system ke sakal vyavhaar ko dizin kar sakate hai or yahaan tak ki logic prakriyaayon ke vivaran par vichaar kiye bina satat anukaran main bhi iskaa pareekshan kar sakate hai, bina tark kaaryon ke sabhi vivaran par vichaar kiye
 The sequential system is further divided into two subcategories
 jab ek "clock" signal state ko parivartit karata he tab "tulykaalik" anukramik pranali ek hi baar main state ko badal detaa he
 "asynchronous" transmits a sequential system change whenever inputs change
 tulykaalik anukramik system atulykaalik circuit kii visheshta se bana hota he jaise flip flop, jo clock jab parivartan karata he tabhi ye parivartan karata he or jisamen timming margin ko dhyaan se dizin kiya jaataa he
 As usual, a synchronous sequential state machine is a practical way to implement by dividing it into a combinational logic and a set of flip flops called a "state register"
 har baar ek ghadi tik tik kii signal detii he or state register sangyojan logic ke pichley state se utpann pratikriya par kabja kar leti he or state mashin ke sangyojan bhaag main aparivertineeya input ke rup main phir se ise daal detii he
 In combination logic, the fastest clock rate is set by most of the time-consuming logic estimations
 state register sirf ek dwiadhari sankhya kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 If there are too many states in the state machine, the logic process is some combination logic that produces a number of states
 isaki tulana main atulykaalik system kaa dizin bahut kathin hota he kyonki sabhi sambhav samay main bhi sambhavit state kaa vichaar kiya janaa chahie
 According to the most common method of constructing the minimum and maximum time tables, the state is present in it and the circuit is adjusted to minimize the state and to make the circuit go periodically to the corresponding state of all its parts
 Force it
 Without such careful design, it is easy to produce coincidentally asynchronous logic that is "unstable" and is real electronics that has unpredictable consequences because of small changes in the value of electronic devices due to accumulated delays
 kuch circuit sahaj rup se apane dizin main antarnihit atulykaalik rahe hai or is tarah hi vishleshan kiya janaa chahie
 As of 2005 almost all digital machines are synchronous design because synchronous design is very easy to create and verify - currently the software that mimics digital machines does not handle asynchronous design
 However, asynchronous logic is better understood if it can be worked out, because its speed is not arbitrarily limited by the clock speed, instead, it operates normally at the speed allowed by the logic gates from which they are constructed
 has been done

 In register transfer logic, binary numbers are stored in groups of flip flops called registers
 prayek register kaa output taron kaa bandal he jise ek "bas" kaha jaataa he jo anya akalan ke liye us nambar ko paas rakhata he
 This assessment is only a part of combination logic

 Loki steals Tesseract and uses his powers to subdue several shield agents, including Clint Barton and scientist Dr
 Eric Selvig so that he can escape
 is hamale kaa muqabla karne ke liye furi avangers prayog punah shuru kar dete hai

 Captain America, Iron Man, and Romanoff arrive in Germany to capture Loki who is extracting the iridium there, which is necessary to balance the tesseract
 captain america se ladaai ke pashchyaat loki aatmasamarpan kar detaa he or use shield ke vimaan se waapas laayaa jaataa he
 In the journey, Thor arrives, Loki's half-brother and Norse god of power, tries to liberate Loki and convince him
 aayran main or captain america thor kaa saamana karte hai or loki ko antat helikarier par laayaa jaataa he jo shield kaa udne vaala atyaadhunik vaahan he va use halk ke liye banaae gaye khaas jail main band kar diya jaataa he
 The Avengers are divided into two parts, who present their differences on how to deal with Loki
 saath hi unhen pataa chalata he ki shield tesaract kii taakad nikaal kar hathiyaar bananaa chaahati he
 Fury admits that after the attack in New Mexico a year ago, Shield became aware that there are other species in the universe, some of which may perceive the Earth as an easy target
 iske chalate yah nirnay liya gaya kii tesaract kii madad se aatmaraksha ke liye nae hathiyaaron kaa nirmaan kiya jayega
 During the debate that ensues in the group, Clint Barton and other agents controlled by Loki attack the helicopter and close its engine

 " da holivood reporter ke tod maikaarthi ne kaha kii "haalanki duniya ko bachaane kii kahani kai baar doharaai ja chuki he parantu whaden ne ise is baar is tarah banaaya he kii yah kuch nai dish kii tarah lagati he
 " vinimay dar do alag alag mudraon kii saapeksh keemat hoti he, arthath ek mudra ke padon main duusari mudra ke mulya kii maap he
 The rate of exchange between any two currencies is determined by their mutual demand and supply
 videshi vinimay ke sambandh main vichaar karne se pehle 'vinimay' shabd kaa arth jaan lenaa aavashyak he
 The simple meaning of exchange is to get other items of need in exchange for one thing
 vastuon ke kray vikray athwa adal badal ko bhi vinimay kehete hai
 In foreign exchange, there is a reciprocal exchange of leni from different countries
 isamen vinimay kii dar ke vivechan ke atirikt us sab leni deni kaa vivechan bhi shaamil he jiske dwaara ek desh anya deshon kaa dendar or lender ban jaataa he
 In foreign exchange it is also considered how the leni deni is paid and what is the effect of its inequality on the rate of exchange 
 hamen yah vichaar karnaa he ki koi desh anya desh kaa kin kaarnon se dendar or lender ho jaataa he
 The amount of goods that come from outside to a country becomes a debtor of that amount to other countries, and the amount of money that he sends to other countries becomes a creditor of that amount
 videshi jahaajon par maal kaa aayaat hone se jahaajon ke bhaade ke liye bhi vah anya deshon kaa dendar ho jaataa he
 Similarly, by sending goods out on his ship, he also becomes a creditor of other countries
 desh kii sarkaar yaa vyakti yadi anya desh ke rinpatr evam share aadi kharidta he to desh anya deshon kaa lender ho jaataa he
 In addition, other countries also become debtors at the time of taking loans from foreigners
 desh main kaary karanevaale videshiyon kii bachat or munaafe ke kaaran bhi desh anya deshon kaa dendar ho jaataa he
 When a country is obliged to pay special 'tax' to other countries for some reason, it becomes the liability of the other country for this amount
 uparyukt len-dein kaa bhugtan karne ke liye kuch deshon main to sone chaandi ke sikke prachlit hai or unka len dein inhen sikkon main koota jaataa he
 If for some reason the country does not find any other means to pay its debt, it is obliged to send gold or silver
 vyapaaree log praaia: bhugtan videshi hundiyon se hi karte hai kyonki ab sarkaar dwaara sona chaandi baahar bhejne par roak laga di gai he
 a bill is a type of decree
 hundi likhanewaala kisi vyakti yaa sanstha ko yah ajna detaa he ki vah hundi main likhi rakam namollekh kiye hue vyakti ko de de
 Such a bill is called a 'merchant bill'
 vyapaaree hundi ke atirikt ek or duusari tarah kii hundiyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jinhen 'rojgari hundi' kehete hai
 Apart from this, passenger bills, government bills and bills issued by banks are also used to pay foreign trade transactions
 uparyukt len dein jis dar par chukaaya jaataa he use vinimay dar kehete hai
 At this rate, foreign sighting bills are often accepted by banks and at this rate, there is an inequality of the country's leniency
 yadi sarkaar dwaara baahar sona bhejne main koi roak tok na ho or desh kii deni leni se bahut adhik ho to vinimay kii dar us seemaa tak pahunch jaati he jab deshavaasiyon ko hundi ke badale sona bhejne main hi suvidha hoti he
 This limit is called gold-export-rate and the rate of exchange does not go beyond it
 iske vipareet anya deshon se kisi desh ko deni kii apeksha leni bahut adhik hoti he tab us desh kii vinimay kii dar us seemaa tak pahunch jaati he jab anya deshon ko us desh main hundiyaan bhejne ke badale sona bhejne main suvidha hoti he
 This rate is called Swarnaayat Aayat Dar
 videshi vinimay kii dar is seemaa se bahar nahin jaati
 In this way, the rate of exchange of a country increases within the gold import and export rate
 ab hamen yah jaananaa he ki vinimay kii dar kii atyadhik ghatbad kaa vyapaar yaa bhinn bhinn virgon ke manushyon par kya prabhaav padataa he
 When the exchange rate starts going out of the gold-import-rate, goods importers from outside the country benefit and imports get a boost
 saath hi saath desh se baahar maal bhejnevaalon ko haani uthaani padati he
 The price of goods inside the country starts to decrease slightly
 un udyogon ko haani hoti he jinka desh ke andar videshi saste maal se muqabla rahata he
 In this way, there is a gain and a loss due to excessive variation in the rate of exchange
 vyapaariyon ko hajaaron kaa nuksaan ho jaataa he or kuch ko utana hi phayda ho jaataa he
 To avoid this loss benefit, it is the effort of the government of every country to prevent the rate of exchange from increasing drastically
 vartmaan kaal main sansar ke adhikansh deshon main sone or chaandi ke pramanik sikke prachlit nahin hai
 Patramudra is a universal promotion
 swarna ke aayaat or niryaat par sarkaron dwaara roak laga di gai he
 For this reason, it becomes necessary for the government of any country to control the foreign exchange rate of its country
 vah hameshaa praytn karti he ki yah kisi bhi samay desh kii deni leni se bahut adhik na hone paave
 The main reason for controlling foreign exchange is that international trade gets a lot of shock due to the variation in the exchange rate
 at: is ghatbad ko rokane ke liye anek rashtron ne videshi vinimay sameekaran koshon kii sthapana kii
 In that treasury there is the money of indigenous and the money and gold of other countries also
 aarthik sankat ke samay bhi kabhi kabhi desh kii poonji ko baahar jane se rokane ke liye videshi vinimay kaa niyantran kiya jaataa he
 Principal countries of the world have together established the International Monetary Fund
 is kosh kii sthapana se deshon ke bich vittiya maamalon main adhik nikat sahyog kaa yugarambh hua
 The main function of this fund is to help member countries in reducing volatility in foreign exchange
 chaalu vyapaar ke len dein main vyapaktaa laane main bhi yah kosh sahaayak hota he
 Apart from this, it is also helpful in repaying international transactions
