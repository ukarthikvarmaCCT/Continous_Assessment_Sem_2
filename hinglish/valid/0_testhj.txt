 ) According to mythology, there was a king named Sudhanwa in ancient times
 ve ek din akhet ke liye van gayi
 It was only after he left that his wife became menstruated
 usne is samachar ko apni shikari pakshi ke madhyam se raja ke paas bhijwaya
 After receiving the news, Maharaj Sudhanwa took out his semen in one and gave it to the bird
 pakshi us done ko raja kii patni ke paas pahunchaane akaash main ud chalaa
 On the way, that predatory bird found another predatory bird
 donon pakshiyon main yuddh hone laga
 During the war, he got rid of both bird's claws and fell into Yamuna
 yamuna main brahma ke shaap se machhlee bani ek apsara rahati thi
 The nymph of fish swallowed semen flowing in both and due to its effect she became pregnant
 garbh purna hone par ek nishad ne us machhlee ko apane jaal main fasaa liya
 When Nishad cut the fish, a boy and a girl came out of his stomach
 nishad un shishuon ko lekar maharaj sudhanva ke paas gaya
 Due to not being the son of Maharaj Sudhanwa, he kept the child with him, named Matsyaraj
 balika nishad ke paas hi rah gai or uskaa naam matsaygandha rakhaa gaya kyonki uske angon se machhlee kii gandh nikalati thi
 That girl is also known as Satyavati
 badi hone par vah naav khene kaa kaary karne lagi ek baar parashar muni ko uski naav par baith kar yamuna paar karnaa padaa
 Parashar Muni Satyavati became enamored of beauty and said, "devi! i want to cum with you
 " satyavati ne kaha, "muniver! aap brahmagyani hai or main nishad kanya
 We do not have sex
 " tab parashar muni bole, "balike! tum chintaa mat karo
 You will remain a virgin even after childbearing
 " itnaa kah kar unhone apane yogabal se chaaron ore ghaney kuhare kaa jaal rach diya or satyavati ke saath bhoga kiya
 After that, while blessing him, he said, the smell of fish coming out of your body will turn into fragrant
 " When the time came, Satyavati had a son from Vedas, who passed from the womb
 janm hote hi vah balak bada ho gaya or apni mata se bolaa, "mata! tu jab kabhi bhi vipatti main mujhe samaran karegi, main upasthit ho jaaungaa
 "having said this, he went to the island of Dwaipayan to do penance
 dwaipayan dweep main tapasya karne tathaa unke sharir kaa rang kaala hone ke kaaran unhe krishna dwaipayan kaha jane laga
 Later on he became famous by the name of Ved Vyas because of commenting on the Vedas
 hindu dharm shastron ke anusaar maharishi vyas trikalgya the
 And seeing from the divine point of view, he knew that religion would be weakened in Kali Yuga
 dharm ke ksheen hone ke kaaran manushya naastik, kartavyaheen or alpaayu ho jaavenge
 Sangopang study of a huge Veda will be out of their power
 isiliye maharishi vyas ne veda kaa chaar bhaagon main vibhaajan kar diya jisase ki kam buddhi evam kam smaranshakti rakhane vaale bhi vedon kaa adhyayan kar saken
 Vyas Ji named him - Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda
 vedon kaa vibhaajan karne ke kaaran hi vyas ji veda vyas ke naam se vikhyath huye
 Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda taught their disciples Pal, Jaimin, Vaishampayan and Sumantumuni respectively
 veda main nihit gyaan ke atyant gudh tathaa shushk hone ke kaaran veda vyas ne paanchave veda ke rup main puraanon kii rachana kii jinamein veda ke gyaan ko rochak kathaon ke rup main bataaya gaya he
 He taught the Puranas to his disciple Rome Harshan
 vyas ji ke shishyone apni apni buddhi ke anusaar un vedon kii anek shakhaayen or up shakhaayen bana deen
 Vyas Ji composed the Mahabharata
 puranic-mahakavy yug kii mahaan vibhuti, mahabharat, attharah puraana, shrimadbhagwat, brahmasutra, mimasaa jaise adwitiya sahitya-darshan ke praneta vedavyas kaa janm asadha poornima ko lagbhag 3000 i

 The Shrimad Bhagwat Gita is part of the world's largest epic 'mahabharata'
 ramnagar ke kile main or vyas nagar main vedavyas kaa mandir he jahow magh main prayek somvaar mela lagata he
 The famous festival of Guru Purnima is celebrated to commemorate the birth anniversary of Vyas ji
 puraanon tathaa mahabharat ke rachayita maharishi kaa mandir vyasapuri main vidyaman he jo kaashi se paanch mile kii duuri par sthit he
 In the Ramnagar fort of Maharaja Kashi Naresh, there is a statue of Vyeshwar in the western part, which is known by the common people as Chhota Ved Vyas
 vastav main vedavyas kii yah sab se pracheen murti he
 Visvesvara expelled Vyasji from Kashi due to Vyasji cursing Kashi
 tab vyasaji lolark mandir ke aagney kone main gangaji ke purvi tat par sthit hue
 The mention of this incident in Kashi section is as follows- lolarkadan agnidigbhage, swarghuni purvarodhsi

 Skanda Purana, Kashi Block 96 / 201 vyasaji ne puraanon tathaa mahabharat kii rachana karne ke pashchaat brahmasutron kii rachana bhi yahan kii thi
 Like Valmiki, Vyas is also a derivative of Sanskrit poets
 mahabharat main upakhyanon kaa anusaran kar anek sanskrit kaviyon ne kavy, naatak aadi kii sristi kii he
 In relation to the Mahabharata itself, Vyasji's statement is more accurate - what is in this text is elsewhere, but what is not in it is nowhere else
 kalapi main yamuna ke kisi dweep main inkaa janm hua tha
 Vyasji was called Krishna Dwaipayana because his color was black
 ve paidaa hote hi maan kii ajna se tapasya karne chale gayi the or kah gayi the ki jab bhi tum samaran karogi, main aa jaaoongaa
 He was not only the father of Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidur, but he also supported the Pandavas in the form of a shadow in times of calamity
 unhone teen varshon ke athak parishram se mahabharat granth kii rachana kii thi- Tribhirvarshe: Sadotthayi Krishnadvaipayanomuni:
 mahabharatamakhyaanan kritvaadi mudtamam
 
 adiparv - When he saw the deterioration of religion, he made Vyasa, the department of Veda, and called Ved Vyas
 vedon kaa vibhaag kar unhone apane shishy sumantu, jaimini, pel or vaishampayan tathaa putr shukdev ko unka adhyayan karaayaa tathaa mahabharat kaa upadesh diya
 Because of your supernatural talent, you are considered an incarnation of God
 sanskrit sahitya main valmiki ke baad vyas hi sarvshereshth kavi hue hai
 His poetry is known by the name of 'arsha Kavya'
 vyas ji kaa uddeshy mahabharat likh kar yuddh kaa varnan karnaa nahin, balki is bhautik jivan kii ni:sarataa ko dikhaanaa he
 His statement is that even if a man gets to know the Vedang and the Upanishads, he can never be learned because this Mahabharata is simultaneously economics, theology and kamshastra

 Pythagoras of Samos, "or simply ὁ Πυθαγόρας; he was born between 580 and 572 BCE and died between 500 and 490 BCE), or Pheasagoras, was an Ionian Greek mathematician and philosopher and Pythagoreanism Was the founder of a religious movement called unhen aksar ek mahaan ganitagya, rahasywaadee or vaigyanik ke rup main sammaan diya jaataa he; haalaanki kuch log ganit or prakritik darshan main unke yogadan kii sambhaavnaaon par sawaal uthaate hai
 Herodotus considers him "the most capable philosopher among the Greeks"
 unka naam unhen pithia or apollo se jodta he; aristipas ne unke naam ko yah kah kar spasht kiya ki "ve pithian se kam sach nahin bolte the," or lamblikaas ek kahani bataate hai ki pithia ne bhavishyavaanee kii ki unki garbhvatee maan ek bahut hi sundar, budhimaan bachche ko janm degi jo maanav jaati ke liye bahut hi laabhakaari hoga
 He is known mainly for Pythagoras's theorem, which is named after him
 pithogoras ko "sankhya ke janak" ke rup main janaa jaataa he, chhathi shatabdi isa purv main dharmik shikshan or darshanamen unka mahatvapurn yogadan rahaa
 His work influenced narrative stories more than others of the pre-socratic period, more can be told with confidence about his life and teachings
 ham jaanate hai ki pithogoras or unke shishy maanate the ki sab kuch ganit se sambandhit he or sankhyaon main hi antat vaastaviktaa he or ganit ke madhyam se har cheez ke bare main bhavishyavaanee kii ja sakati he tathaa har cheez ko ek taal baddh praturup yaa chakra ke rup main mapa ja saktaa he
 According to Lambalikas, Pythagoras stated that "number is the ruler of ideas and forms and the cause of gods and demons
" " He was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of intelligence, and the ideas of Pythagoras had a profound influence on Plato
 durbhaagya se, pithogoras ke bare main bahut kam tathy gyaat hai, kyonki un ke lekhan main se bahut kam hi bache hai
 Many of Pythagoras' accomplishments are actually achievements of his colleagues and successors

 In Egypt, he taught some geometrical principles, inspired by which he eventually gave the theorem which is now known as him
 yah sambhav prerana berlin pepirus main ek asaadhaaran samasya ke rup main prastut he
 Upon coming from Samos to Croton, Calabria, Italy, he established a secret religious society that closely resembled the early Orphic cult and was likely influenced by it
 pithogoras ne croton ke saanskrithik jivan main sudhar laane kii koshish kii, nagarikon ko sadachaar kaa paalan karne ke liye prerit kiya or apane chaaron or ek anuyaayiyon kaa samooh sthapit kar liya jo pithoigorian kehalaate hai
 The rules of operation of this cultural center were very strict
 usne ladakon or ladakiyon donon ke liye saamaan rup se apana vidhyalay kholaa
jin logon ne pithogoras ke saamaaj ke andruni hisse main bhaag liye ve apane aap ko methmetakoi kehete the
 They lived in school, had no personal property of their own, had to eat mainly vegetarian food, other students who lived in the surrounding areas were also allowed to attend Pythagoras' school
 unhen akusameticoi ke naam se janaa jaataa tha or unhen maance khaane or apni nijee sampati rakhane kii anumati thi
 Richard Blechmore told Pithogoriano's religious observations in his book The Le Monastery, "this was the first example of ascetic life recorded in history
 lamblikaas ke anusaar, pithogoras ne dharmik shikshan, saamaanya bhojan, vyaayaam, pathan or darshanik adhyayan se yukt jivan kaa anusaran kiya
 Music was an essential organizing factor in this life: the disciples used to sing hymns regularly for Apollo; They used the veena to cure illness of the soul or body; Poetry recitations were done before and after bedtime to enhance the memory
 flavius jojefus, apian ke viruddh, yahudee dharm kii raksha main greek darshanashastra ke khilaaf kaha ki samayrna ke harmipus ke anusaar pithogoras yahudee vishwaason se parichit tha, usne unamem se kuch ko apane darshan main shaamil kiya
 In the last phase of his life, he fled to Metapontum because of a conspiracy against him and his followers by an elite cell of crotches
 vah agyaat kaarnon se metapontem m main 90 saal kii umr main mar gaya
 Bertrand Russell, in The History of Western Philosophy, reported that Pythagoras had so much influence over Plato and others that he was considered the most effective of all Western philosophers
 yah sanghathan kuch myanon main ek skool, kuch myanon main ek bhaichara or kuch myanon main ek math tha
 It was based on the religious teachings of Pythagoras and was very secretive
 sabase pehle, skool samaaj kii naitikta se bahut adhik sambandhit tha
 Members had to live with an ethics point of view, love each other, share political beliefs, follow peace and dedicate themselves to the mathematics of nature
 pithogoras ke anuyaayi saamanytah "pathogoriens "kehalaate the
 He is commonly called a philosophical mathematician who had an influence on the beginning of axial geometry, written in Elements by Euclid 200 years after its development
 pithogoras ne shanti ke ek niyam kaa prekshan kiya jo acamithia kehalaata tha, is niyam ko todane par maut kii sajaa di jaati thi
 This was because Pythagoras believed that a person's words are usually careless, leading to mispronunciation, and according to him that one should always remain silent if anyone doubts what he should say
 
 unka ek or niyam tha ki "kisi bhi vyakti ki ek pareshaani main madad kerani chahie, use neeche nahin girane dena chahie, kyonki niskriyata ko protsaahit karnaa ek bahut bada paap he
 "and they used to say" don't go back after you leave your house, because the Furies will be with you, "it reminded them that learning a little without learning everything is better than creation, about God and mathematics, Learning the truth
 pithogoras kii jeevani porfyri main, kaha gaya ki "yah shanti koi saadhaaran kism kii shanti nahin thi
 "the Pythagoreans were divided into an inner circle methmetikoi and an outer circle akousmatikoi
 porfyri main likhaa gaya ki methmeticoiis gyaan ko adhik vistaar purvak sikhte the or akusameticoi bina kisi sateek pradarshnee ke pithogoras kii lekhnee ke keval saransh sheershakon ko sunate the
 According to Lumblikas, Akausmatikoi was a common disciple who listened to the lectures of Pythagoras from outside a curtain
 akusameticoi ko pithogoras ko dekhne kii ijaajat nahin thi or unhen panth ke andruni rahasy nahin sikhaaye jate the
 Instead, they were taught behavior and morality in secret ways, brief things with secret meanings
 akusameticoine methmeticoiko asli pithogoriens mana lekin iskaa vipareet nahin tha
 After the murder of several methmetkoi by Cyclone's cohort, a grumpy disciple, the two groups are completely separated from each other, with Pythagoras' wife Theo and his two daughters capturing methmeticoica
 theno ek orfic anuyaayi kii beti thi, vah apane aap main ek ganitagya thi
 It is said that he also wrote several books on mathematics, physics, medicine, and child psychology, although there is nothing left of his writing

 Pythagoras had many restrictions in its society
 jaise ek krosbaar par kadam nahin rakhaa jaye or faliyaan nahin khaayi jaaen
 These rules were old superstitions such as, "running down a ladder is bad luck
" "yahan tak ki pracheen samay main bhi pithogoras ko badnaam karne ke liye misticos logos naamak apmanjanak oopaadhi di gayi
 The ban on legumes may be related to favism which is widely spread around the Mediterranean region
 yahan mukhya bindu he akusamata arthath "niyam", taaki andhvishwasi nishedh praathmik rup se akusameticoiper lagu hote the or adhikansh niyam pithogoras kii mrityu ke baad aaye or methmeticoise bilkul mukt the
 Who are arguably the true patrons of the tradition of Pythagoras
 methmeticoine akusameticoiki tulana main andar kii samaj par adhik jor diya
 Even stressed the expansion of certain rules and methods of worship
 methmeticoi ke liye pithogorian hone kaa matlab he ek janmajaat gunvattta or aantarik samaj kii upasthiti
 There was also another way of dealing with akousmata and -e; By their iconographic depiction
 hamaare paas iske kuch udhaaharan hai, ek he unki arestu kii vyakhya: " ek santulan par kadam mat rakho', arthath laalchee mat bano; 'aag par talwaar se prahaar mat karo", arthath ek krodhit vyakti se saath tikhe shabdon main baat mat karo, "dil ko mat khao " arthath apane aap ko dukh main mat jakad lo aadi
 We have evidence of Pythagorean living depiction as far back as the fifth century BCE, which means that such strange things were said to be puzzles
 pithogorian ko unki atmaaon kii sthanantargaman ke siddhant ke liye bhi janaa jaataa he or saath hi unka siddhant ki sankhya main chizon kii vaastavik prakruti he
 They adopted purification rites and developed different rules of living, believing that these rules would enable them to attain a higher status among the gods
 unke zyaadaatar rahasyavaad aatma ko orfic parampara se abhinn rakhte hue prathit hote hai
 The Orphics adopted many purificatory rites as well as various developmental rites in the underworld
 pithogoras siros ke feresids se bhi nikat rup se sambandhit he, ek pracheen tippaneekar vyakti jo atmaaon ke sthanantargaman kii shiksha dene vaale pehle greek maane jate hai
 Ancient commentators believe that Pherecidus was the most intimate teacher of Pythagoras
 feresids ne penta maikos ke shabdon main aatma ke bare main shiksha di or-; pentagram ke pithogorian upyog kii sabase sambhavit utpatti, unke dwaara sadasyon ke bich pahchaan ke pratik ke rup main prayukt kii jaati thi or aantarik swasthya ke ek pratik ke rup main prayukt kii jaati thi
 Pai Thogores was very much interested in music, so his followers were also interested in music
 pithogoras ek sangitajna or ganitagya the
 Pythagoras wanted to improve the music of his time, believing that there was not enough harmony in this music, it was very busy
 puranic katha ke anusaar, pithogoras ne khoja ki sangeet ke note ko ganitiya samikarnon main anuwaad kiya ja saktaa he, yah tab hua jab vah ek din ek kaam kar rahe lohaar ke paas se ho kar niklaa or usne sochaa ki unki nihaai kii chot se utpann hone vaali aawaaj sundar or saamanjasy purna thi or usne yah nirdhaarit kar liya ki jo bhi vaigyanik niyam iskaa kaaran he vah avashya hi ganitiya hona chahie or ise sangeet par lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 He went to the blacksmith and looking at his tools tried to find out how it happened
 usne paaya ki nihaiyaan ek duusare ke saadhaaran anupaat main thim
 One was half the size of the first and the other was 2 / 3 the size and so on
 
) Pythagoras explained the theory of numbers in detail, the true meaning of which remains a topic of debate among scholars even today
 pithogoras "golon kii santatta " par vishwaas karata tha, unka maananaa tha ki grah or taare ganitiya samikarnon ke anusaar gati karte hai, isi prakaar kii kuch samanta sangeet ke swaron main pai jaati he or isse ek madhur sangeet kaa utpaadan hota he
 Template: Academia chauthi sadi isvi se, pithogoras ko pithogoras kii prameya kii khoj kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jyamiti main ek prameya jo sthapit karti he ki ek samakon tribhuj main vikarn sa kaa varg anya do bhujaaon ba or a ke varg ke yoga ke baraabar hota he
 That is, a2 + b2 = c2
 haalaanki vah prameya jo ab unke naam se jaani jaati he, pehle ise babiloniyon or bharatiyon ke dwaara kaam main liya gaya
 It is often said that he or his students gave the first evidence
 haalaanki is baat par dabaav daalaa janaa chahie ki jis tareeke se babiloniyon ne pithogoras kii sankhyaon ko sambhala usase pataa chalata he ki ve jaanate the ki yah siddhant saamanytah sahi sabit hota he or ve kuch aise pramaanon ke bare main bhi jaanate the jinhen ab tak kunirup sroton main nahin khoja gaya he
 Because of the secretive nature of their school and its students dedicating everything to their teachers, there is no evidence that Pythagoras worked on it himself to prove the theorem
 us maamle ke liye, is baat ke koi pramaan nahin hai ki unhone kisi bhi ganitiya yaa para ganitiya samasyaon par kaam kiya
 Some believe it to be a myth carefully constructed by Plato's followers two centuries after Pythagoras' death
 mukhyatah plato kii para bhautikee ke maamle ko aadhyatmik tehraane ke liye, jo unke dwaara pithogoras ko samarpit vichaaron kaa saath thik prakaar se kaam karte the
 This imposition has been going on for centuries and has been associated with modern times
 pithogoras ke naam kaa is prameya se sambandh sthapit karne kaa sabase pehla ullekh unki mrityu ke paanch sadiyon ke baad sisarau or plutark ke lekhan main miltaa he
 Today Pythagoras is distinguished as a devotee by the Ahl al-tauheed or Druze faith, along with his followers, Greek Plato, but there were also critics of Pythagoras, such as Heraclitus, who said that "learning too much does not make sense; Otherwise it was taught to Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again to Xenophanes and Hecateus
 pithogoras kaa drushtikon dharmik or vaigyanik tha, unki najar main vigyaan or dharm ek dusre se sambandhit hai
 Religiously, Pythagoras was a follower of metempsychosis
 ve sthantar aagaman yaa aatma ke punar janm main vishwaas karte the, unka maananaa tha ki aatma jab tak sadaachari nahin ho jaati tab tak vah maanav, pashu, yaa subjiyon main baar baar avatar leti rahati he
 His idea of rebirth was influenced by ancient Greek religion
 vah pehle vyakti the jisane yah prastaavit kiya kii vichaar prakriya or aatma mashtishk main sthit he dil main nahin
 He himself remembered four lives in detail as he claimed to have lived and used to hear the cry of his dead friend crying as a dog barked
 pithogoras kaa ek vishwaas yah tha ki jivan kaa saar sankhya he
 In this way, the stability of everything makes up the universe
 swasthya jaisi chijen tatwon ke ek sthir anupaat par nirbhar karti hai; kisi bhi cheez kaa bahut kam yaa bahut zyada hona ek asantulan kaa kaaran hota he jo kisi bhi jeev ko aswasth bana saktaa he
 He compared ideas to number calculations
 jab darshan lok siddhanton se jud jaataa he to vah vishwaas ban jaataa he, ki jivan ke saar kaa gyaan sankhyaon ke rup main khoja ja saktaa he
 If it is taken one step further, it can be said that because mathematics is an undiscovered essence, the essence of life is an undiscovered characteristic that can be encountered by studying mathematics
 pithogoras ke koi bhi lekhan nahin milte hai, haalaanki unke naam ke saath kuch jaali lekhan jude hai or inamen se vartmaan main bhi paae jate hai; ye puraatanta main prasaarit hue hai
 Complex ancient sources such as Aristotle and Aristogenus cast doubt on these writings
 pracheen pithogoriens ne aamtaur par apane swami ke vaakyanshon ko muhaavarey autose effe ke saath spasht kiya or apane shikshan kii multah maukhik prakruti par bal diya
 Pythagoras as the character of Ovid's last book in the Metamorphoses, where Ovid explains his philosophical outlook
 pithogoras ko yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya gaya he, "koi bhi aadmi mukt nahin he jo apane aap ko niyantrit nahin kar saktaa he
 " pithogoras kaa ek anya paksh bhi he, jisamen vah apane aitihaasik vyaktitv ke aas paas vistrut kinvadantiyon kaa ek vishay ban gaye
 Aristotle described Pythagoras as a supernatural being who performs miraculous acts, describing him in such an aspect as a Golden Thai, a symbol of divinity
 arestu or anya logon ke anusaar, kuch pracheen log maanate the ki unamem antariksh or samay se hokar yatra karne kii kshamta he or jaanwaron or podhon ke saath baat karne kii kshamta he
 "golden Thai" is an extract from the entry of Brewer's Dictionary of Frace and Fable
 aisa kaha jaataa tha ki pithogoras ke paas ek golden thai tha, jise usne aberis ko darshaya, jo uttardeshvasi pujari tha or usne olympic khelon main pradarshan kiya
 Another legend is drawn from Brewer's Dictionary
 vah unke chandramaa ke bare main varnan ko darshaati he
 Pythagoras believed that he could write on the moon
 unki yojana thi ki rakt main ek darpan par likhaa jaye or ise chaand ke saamne rakh diya jaye or jab chaand kii discs par shilaalekh pratibimbit hoga
 One of Pythagoras's main achievements was the discovery that music is based on a proportional interval of numbers from 1 to 4
 uskaa vishwaas tha ki sankhya pranali or isiilie brahmad pranali, in sankhyaon ke yoga par aadhaarit hoti he: das devataaon ke bajaay das yaa tetractis of di dekad ke dwaara pithogoras kii kasam
 Odd numbers were male and even numbers were female
 usne 3 se 5 jyamitiya thoson se nirmit, ganitiya anupaaton ke siddhanton kii khoj kii
 Hippasus, a member of his sequence, also discovered an proportional number, but the idea was not conceivable for Pythagoras, and according to legend Hippasus was executed
 pithogoras yaa ne varg sankhyaon kii bhi khoj kii
 He found that if for example, if four stones were taken and arranged as a square, then not only each arm is equal to the other arm, but if the two sides are multiplied by each other, they will arrange the square
 Is equal to the sum of the total number of stones in it
 isiilie ise "varg mul" kaha jaataa he
 He was one of the first to think that the Earth is round and all planets have an axis and that all planets revolve around a central point
 unhone kaha ki yah kendriya bindu prithvi he, lekin baad main kaha gaya ki yah kendriya bindu "agni" he jise unhone kabhi bhi surya ke rup main nahin pahachaanaa
 He also said that the moon is another planet that he called "counter Earth" —the latter believed in the limited — unlimited
 pithogoras yaa ek vyapak arth main pithogoriens ne plato ke kaam par ek mahatvapurn prabhaav daalaa
 According to RM Hare his influence consisted of three points: a) The Platonic Republic may be related to the ideas of "an organized community of like-minded people", as Pythagoras established in Croton
 ba) is baat ke pramaan hai ki sambhawatah plato ne pithogoras se yah vichaar liya ki ganit or saamaanya bhashaa, amoort soch darshanik soch ke liye ek surakshit aadhaar he, saath hi vigyaan or naitikta main paryaapt thisis ke liye bhi yaa aadhaar he
 C) Plato and Pythagoras presented the same idea in the "mystic approach to the soul and its place in the physical world"
 aisa lagata he ki donon orfism se prabhavit the
 Plato's ideas were clearly influenced by the work of Architas, an actual Pythagorean of the third generation, who made significant contributions to geometry, which is reflected in the Eighth Book of Elements of Euclid
 pracheen rome or numa pompilius kii kivdantiyon main rome kaa doosraa raja, pithogoras ke adheen adhyayan karata tha, aisa kaha jaataa he
 This is not likely because the two equally accepted dates for life do not impose
 pithogoras ne ek gupt samaaj kii sthapana kii jo pithogorian brotherhud kehalaati he yah ganit ke adhyayan ko samarpit thi
 This had a profound influence on future occult traditions, such as Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry, both groups devoted to the study of mathematics, both claiming to have developed from the Pythagorean Brotherhood
 pithogoras ke ganit ke rahasyamayi or gupt gunon kii charchaa menley pi haal ke adhyay di secret teachings of aal ages main kii gayi he jiskaa sheershak he "pithogorian methmatics "
 Pythagoras's theory later had a profound influence on numerology, which became very popular throughout the Middle East in the ancient world
 8 veen sadi ke muslim kemiagar jabir ebn hayaan ne vyapak sankhya vigyaan ke aadhaar par kaam kiya, vah pithogoras ke siddhant se bahut adhik prabhavit tha
 There is no primary source about Pythagoras
 yah lekh pithogoras kii shastreey vyakhya karata he jo baad ke lekhakon ke lekhon par aadhaarit he
 Since much of the information available is written after centuries of Pythagoras' life, his accuracy is uncertain
 aisa mana jaataa he ki praarambhik pithogorian kaa ganitiya mahatva atishyoktipurna he or pithogorian orfic yani gupt panthi the
 He had an influence on numerology, later serious mathematicians were born out of them when geometry became popular throughout Greece

 Biomolecules are polymers produced by living animals
 selulose, starch, kytin, protein, peptid, diene or arene, ye sabhi jeevabahulkon ke udhaaharan hai, jinamein monomeric ikaiyon ke rup main kramshah sharkara, amino amla or newcliotide hote hai
 Cellulose is the most common biopolymer and organic compound found on Earth

 The main differences between polymers and biopolymers are in their structures
 biopolimaron samet polimur monomeron naamak ikaiyon se bane hote hai
 The structure of biopolymers is often well elucidated, although it is not their characteristic feature: in proteins, the correct chemical structure and systemic chain of these units is called the primary structure
 kai boyopolimur swatah hi vishisht aakaaron main dohare ho jate hai, jisase unke jaivik kaaryaklap nirdhaarit hote hai or jo jatil tareeke se unki praathmik rachanaaon par nirbhar hote hai
 The study of the compositional properties of biopolymers is called anatomical biology
 iske vipareet adhikansh sanshleshit polimaron kii rachana kaaphi saral or adhik random hoti he
 a molecular mass distribution is reached by the fact that it is not found in biopolymers
 In fact, since in most life-states their synthesis is controlled by a template-directed process, so all biopolymers of one type are uniform in appearance
 Are - They all have the same series and numbers of monomers and all have equal weight
 is prakriya ko monodispercity kehete hai, jabaki sanshleshit polimaron main polidispercity hoti he
 Consequently, biopolymers have a polydispersity index of 1
 biopolimur saamanytah jaevpindon se utpann hote hai, jo sharkara chukundar, aalu yaa gehun jaisi fasalon se praapt hota he
 When they are used to produce biopolymers, they are classified as usable crops, which can be converted into the following pathways: sharkara chukundar – gliconic acid – poliglonic acid - Starch - Lactic acid - Polylactic acid jaevpind – – byoithenal – ethane - polithilin Biopolymers are renewable, durable and can be neutral to carbon biopolimur akshay hai kyonki ve vanaspati padaarthon se banate hai jinhen anwarat rup se har varsh ugaaya ja saktaa he
 These plant materials originate from agricultural non-food crops
 isaliye biopolimaron kaa prayog ek sthaayee udyog kaa nirmaan kar saktaa he
 In contrast, the materials obtained from the petrochemicals required for polymers will eventually run out
 In addition, biopolymers can reduce carbon emissions and decrease the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere
 aisa isaliye sambhav he kyonki unke avakrameekaran ke samay utsarjit CO2 unke sthaan par ugaai gai fasalon dwaara avashoshit kar lee jaati he, jisase ve carbon ke prati tatasth ho jate hai
 Biopolymers are biodegradable and some can also be composted
 kuch biopolimur jaev avakramakaraniya hote hai – ve sookshmjeevanuon dwaara CO2 or jal main vichchhedit kar diye jate hai
 In addition, some of these biodegradable biopolymers can be composted - they can be put into the process of industrial blending, with up to 90% of their parts dissected within 6 months
 jo biopolimur iske liye sakasham hote hai unhen european maanak ien 13432 ke antargat ek sammishran yogya nishaan se chinhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Sugar-based biopolymers do not often follow convention

 Additionally, many saccharide units can undergo various chemical changes, such as amination, and may also form part of other molecules such as glycoproteins
 vastuon main audyogic prayog ke liye aajkal sabase adhik dhyaan khinchne vaale policecridon main selulose or starch hai
 But more complex carbohydrate polymers resulting from bacteria and mildew are now receiving more attention
 udaahranon main janthan, kardlaan, pululaan or hayaluronic acid shaamil hai
 These polymers usually consist of multiple types of carbohydrate monomers and in many cases these polymers have regular branched compositions
 udhaaharan ke liye starch shakhit or rekhaakaar polimaron kaa ek bhautik sanyog hota he, lekin usamen keval ek hi prakaar kaa carbohydrate hota he – glucose

 ye filmein bioriektaron main jhilliyon ke rup main upyogi ho sakati hai jinako phir anzime milakar avakramit kiya ja saktaa he
 Many polymer researchers believe that polymer chemistry began with the identification of cellulose
 Cellulose was first discovered about 150 years ago
 selulose vanaspati dwaara utpann anya policecridon se kuch baton main bhinn hota he, isaki anvik shrankhla bahut lambii hoti he or isamen ek baar-baar aane vaali ikai shaamil hoti he
 In nature it is found in crystalline form
 koshika bhittiyon main selulose sookshmatantuon se rasaynic nishkarshan se praapt kiya jaataa he
 Cellulose in all forms is a very crystalline, high molecular weight polymer that cannot be mixed or dissolved in any other solution except for the fastest, dissolving solutions of hydrogen bonds
 Due to its avidity, cellulose is often converted into its compounds to make it more useful when preparing
 kuch fafoond aise anzimon kaa srav kar sakate hai jo swayan selulose yaa selulose ke anzimi jal-vichchhedan se utpann kam anubhaar vaale aaligomaron kii oxikaran pratikriyaaon ko utprerit kar sakate hai
 Of these, peroxidase forms aldehyde cellulose by providing hydrogen peroxide for free radical attack at the C2 – C3 positions of cellulose, which are very reactive and are dissected to form low molecular weight fractions
 bacteria bhi anzimon kaa srav karte hai, jinamein se kuch aise yogicon kaa nirmaan karte hai jo selulose ko sanyukt rup se avakramit karke carbohydrate poshak banaate hai, jinka prayog sookshmjivi jivit rahane ke liye karte hai

 tailnet ek dwidishi sanvadatmak avaagaman sugamawa pradaan karne ke liye internet yaa sthaneey kshetra network par istemaal kiye jane vaala network protocol he
 Typically, telnet provides access to a command-line interface through a virtual terminal connection on a remote host, which assures an 8-bit byte-oriented data connection over the transmission control protocol
 upyogkarta data TELNET niyantran jaankaree ke saath band main faile hue hai
 Telnet, developed in 1969 with RFC 15, expanded to RFC 854 and standardized the Internet Engineering Task Force Internet Standard as STD 8, one of the first Internet standards
 shabd tailnet us software ko bhi sanderbhit kar saktaa he jo protocol kaa graahak bhaag lagu karte hai
 Telnet client applications are available for virtually all computer platforms
 ek TCP / IP stack ke saath adhikansh network upkaran or oparating system doordaraj ke vinyas ke liye ek tailnet seva kaa samarthan karte hai
 Due to security issues with Telnet, its use for remote access has fallen in favor of SSH
 tailnet ek kriya ke rup main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Telnet means establishing a connection with the telnet protocol, or with the command line client or a program interface
 For example, a common command might be: "change your password, telnet to the server, login and run the password command
" Most often, a user will be tuning in to a unix-like server system or network device such as a router, and will receive a command line interface or a character-based full screen manager
 kai system par, ek tailnet graahak anuprayog sanvadatmak asampurna-tcp satr sthapit karne ke liye istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 It is generally believed that a telnet session that does not use IAC is functionally identical
 lekin, maamla yah nahin he, kyonki duusare network virtual terminal niyam hai jaise, ek bear karres ritern kerector, kaa NULL kerector dwaara anusaran karnaa, jo tailnet protocol ko asampurna-tcp satr se alag karata he
 BGP · DHCP · DNS · FTP · HTTP · IMAP · IRC · LDAP · MGCP · NNTP · NTP · POP · RIP · RPC · RTP · SIP · SMTP · SNMP · SOCKS · SSH · Telnet · TLS / SSL · XMPP · TCP · UDP · DCCP · SCTP · RSVP · ECN · IP · ICMP · icmpv6 · IGMP · ipsec · tailnet ek vishwasaneey conection-unmukh parivahan par aadhaarit ek graahak-sarwar protocol he
 Typically, this protocol is used to establish a connection to the transmission control protocol port number 23, where a Telnet server application is listening
 tailnet, baharhaal, TCP / IP se purv-tithi kaa he or mul rup se network control program protocol par chalaaya gaya tha
 Prior to 5 March 1973, Telnet was an informal protocol without official definition
 multah, yah 7-bit ASCII data vinimay karne ke liye ek 8 bit channel kaa prayog karata tha
 Any byte with a high bit set was a special telnet letter
 5 march 1973 ko, do NIC dastavejon: tailnet protocol spacification, NIC # 15372 or tailnet opshan spacificationaz, NIC # 15373 ke prakaashan ke saath UCLA par ek tailnet protocol maanak paribhaashit kiya gaya
 There are several extensions of the protocol, some of which are adopted as IETF documents STD 27, Internet Standards through STD 32

 When Telnet was initially developed in 1969, most users of networked computers were in computer departments of educational institutions, or large private and government research facilities
 is vaataavaran main, suraksha chintaa kaa itnaa bada vishay nahin tha, jitna kii 1990 ke dashak ke bandwidth visphot ke baad ban gai
 The increase in the number of people using the Internet and, by extension, the number of people trying to circumvent other people's servers made encrypted options much more necessary
 computer suraksha main visheshgy, jaise SANS institute, suzav dete hai ki doordaraj ke login ke liye tailnet kaa prayog nimnlikhit kaarnon ke liye sabhi saamaanya paristhitiyon main band kar dena chahie: These security loopholes have seen the use of the Telnet protocol falling rapidly, particularly in favor of the Secure Shell protocol on the public Internet, first released in 1995
 SSH tailnet kii adhikansh kaaryakshmata pradaan karata he, iske ilaava majboot ancripshan, jo password jaise samvedansheel data ko raah main rokane se bachaane ke liye or public kii pramanikaran, yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki doordaraj kaa computer vastav main wahi he jiskaa vah daawa kar rahaa he
 As with other early Internet protocols, extensions to the Telnet protocol Transport layer security security and Simple Authentication and Security layer authentication that address the above issues are available
 haalanki, adhiktar tailnet karyanvayan in vistaaron kaa samarthan nahin karte or inkaa karyanvayan karne main apekshaakrit kam ruchi rahi he kyunki SSH zyaadaatar prayojanon ke liye paryaapt he
 The main benefit of tls-telnet would be the ability to use a certificate-authority-signed server certificate to authenticate a server host to a client that does not yet have the server stored
 In SSH, there is a weakness that the user must trust the first session of the host until the server key is acquired
 IBM 5250 yaa 3270 kaaryakendre yantranukaran custom tailnet graahakon, TN5250 / TN3270 or IBM sarvaron ke dwaara samarthit he
 Clients and servers typically designed to pass IBM 5250 data streams over Telnet generally support SSL encryption as SSH 5250 does not include emulation
 OS / 400, ke antargat, port 992 surakshit tailnet ke liye difolt port he
 Since the mid-2000s, while the Telnet protocol itself has mostly been superseded for remote login, often at the time of diagnosing problems, to manually talk to other unsuspecting software services, Telnet customers still use Go
 udhaaharan ke liye, yah kabhi kabhi network sevaaon jaise SMTP, IRC, HTTP, FTP, yaa POP3 sarwar ko dibg karne ke liye sarwar ko aadesh jari karne or pratikriyaaon kii jaanch karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 There are restrictions to this approach, however, because the Telnet client does not use an incompatible character mode
 Thus, socket systems on other software such as nc or Unix are popular among system administrators , as they can be called with logic to send no terminal control handshaking data

 We couldn't afford the manpower, but we made up for lost time by working around the clock so our model would be ready for the management review
