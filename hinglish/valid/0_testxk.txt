 In simple words, the oil formula is defined on all polyfields
 The main formula is the following: pane + vertex = core + 2 or f + v = e + 2 or f + v - e = 2 YOU CAN EVEN PRACTICALY EXPERMENT THIS FORMULA ON EVERY POLYHEDRON
 NOW LET'S MOVE AHEAD & KNOW MORE ABOUT THE EULER'S FORMULA
 LETS KNOW ABOUT ITS HISTORY AS MENTIONED BELOW: -euler's formula was proven for the first time by Roger Cotes in 1714 in the form 
 It was Euler who published the equation in its current form in 1748, basing his proof on the infinite series of both sides being equal
 Neither of these men saw the geometrical interpretation of the formula: the view of complex numbers as points in the complex plane arose only some 50 years later
 Euler considered it natural to introduce students to complex numbers much earlier than we do today
 In his elementary algebra text book, Elements of Algebra, he introduces these numbers almost at once and then uses them in a natural way throughout
 This formula can be interpreted as saying that the function eix traces out the unit circle in the complex number plane as x ranges through the real numbers
 Here, x is the angle that a line connecting the origin with a point on the unit circle makes with the positive real axis, measured counter clockwise and in radians
 The original proof is based on the Taylor series expansions of the exponential function ez and of sin x and cos x for real numbers x
 In fact, the same proof shows that Euler's formula is even valid for all complex numbers z
 a point in the complex plane can be represented by a complex number written incartesian coordinates
 Euler's formula provides a means of conversion between cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates
 The polar form reduces the number of terms from two to one, which simplifies the mathematics when used in multiplication or powers of complex numbers
 Any complex number z = x + iy can be written as where φ { \ displaystyle \ phi \ ,} is the argument of z—i
e
, the angle between the x axis and the vector z measured counterclockwise and in radians—which is defined up to addition of 2π
 Now, taking this derived formula, we can use Euler's formula to define the logarithm of a complex number
 To do this, we also use the definition of the logarithm that and that both valid for any complex numbers a and b
 Therefore, one can write: for any z ≠ 0 { \ displaystyle z \ neq 0}
 Taking the logarithm of both sides shows that: and in fact this can be used as the definition for the complex logarithm
 The logarithm of a complex number is thus a multi-valued function, because φ { \ displaystyle \ phi \ ,} is multi-valued
 Finally, the other exponential law which can be seen to hold for all integers k, together with Euler's formula, implies several trigonometric identities as well as de Moivre's formula
 Euler's formula provides a powerful connection between analysis and trigonometry, and provides an interpretation of the sine and cosine functions as weighted sums of the exponential function: The two equations above can be derived by adding or subtracting Euler's formulas: and solving for either cosine or sine
 These formulas can even serve as the definition of the trigonometric functions for complex arguments x
 For example, letting x = iy, we have: Complex exponentials can simplify trigonometry, because they are easier to manipulate than their sinusoidal components
 One technique is simply to convert sinusoids into equivalent expressions in terms of exponentials
 After the manipulations, the simplified result is still real-valued
 For example: Another technique is to represent the sinusoids in terms of the real part of a more complex expression, and perform the manipulations on the complex expression
 For example: This formula is used for recursive generation of a sinusoid at intervals of x radians
 In differential equations, the function eix is often used to simplify derivations, even if the final answer is a real function involving sine and cosine
 Euler's identity is an easy consequence of Euler's formula
 In electrical engineering and other fields, signals that vary periodically over time are often described as a combination of sine and cosine functions, and these are more conveniently expressed as the real part of exponential functions with imaginary exponents, using Euler's formula
 Also, phasor analysis of circuits can include Euler's formula to represent the impedance of a capacitor or an inductor
 In general, raising e to a positive integer exponent has a simple interpretation in terms of repeated multiplication of e
 Raising e to zero or a negative integer exponent can be understood as repeated division
 a rational number exponent can be defined by radicals of e, and an irrational number exponent can be defined by finding rational-number exponents that are arbitrarily close to the irrational-number exponent, in a limit process
 However, to define and understand a complex number exponent of e, a different type of generalization is required for the concept of exponentiation
 In fact, several definitions are possible
 All of them can be proven to be well-defined and equivalent, although the proofs are not included in this article
 It is well-known that, for any real x, the following series is equal to ex: 
 This invites the following definition of ez for complex z: This can be proven to be well-defined; in particular, the series converges for any z
 a simple-to-state, equivalent definition is that ez, for complex z, is the analytic continuation of the function ex for real x
 This can be proven to be well-defined; in particular, it yields a single-valued function on the complex plane
 It is well-known that, for any real x, the following limit is equal to ex: This motivates the following definition of ez for complex z: For real x, the function f=ex is well-known to be the unique real function satisfying the differential equation: for all x
 This motivates a definition of f = ez for complex z as the function that satisfies the differential equation: for all complex z, where the derivative in f' is defined in the sense of a complex derivative
 This can be proven to yield a unique function which is well-defined everywhere on the complex plane
 We would expect the function ez to have the following properties: It turns out that this uniquely specifies a function on the complex plane
 Various proofs of this formula are possible
 The first proof below starts with the "taylor series definition" of ez, while the other two use the "differential equation definition" of ez
 Here is a proof of Euler's formula using Taylor series expansionsas well as basic facts about the powers of i: and so on
 The functions ex, cos x and sin x of the variable x can be expressed using their Taylor expansions around zero: For complex z we define each of these functions by the above series, replacing the real variable x with the complex variable z
 This is possible because the radius of convergence of each series is infinite
 We then find that The rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is absolutely convergent
 Taking z = x to be a real number gives the original identity as Euler discovered it
 Define the function ƒ, of real variable x, as The derivative of ƒ, according to the product rule, is: Therefore, ƒ must be a constant function in x
 Because ƒ is known, the constant that ƒ equals for all real x is also known
 Thus, Multiplying both sides by eix and using it follows that QED Define the function g by Considering that i is constant, the first and second derivatives of g are because i 2 = −1 by definition
 From this the following 2nd-order linear ordinary differential equation is constructed: or Being a 2nd-order differential equation, there are two linearly independent solutions that satisfy it: Both cos and sin are real functions in which the 2nd derivative is identical to the negative of that function
 Any linear combination of solutions to a homogeneous differential equation is also a solution
 Then, in general, the solution to the differential equation is for any constants a and B
 But not all values of these two constants satisfy the known initial conditions for g: However these same initial conditions are resulting in and, finally, Q

 Gaudapada or Gaudapadacharya, was a philosopher of India
 unhone mandukyakarika naamak naamak darshanik granth kii rachana kii jisamen madhyamik darshan kii shabdaawalee kaa prayog karte hue advait veydant ke siddhanton kii vyakhya kii gayi he
 In the tradition of Advaita Vedanta, Gaudapadacharya is remembered as Adi Shankaracharya's 'paramguru' meaning Shankar's Guru Govindapada
 shuk kaa shishy hone ke naate goudpad kii bhi usee samay sthiti maani jaani chahie
 If this is accepted, then how can Gaudapada be accepted as Guru of Lord Shankar's Guru Govindapada born in the eighth century BCE? Although the mythological people purport to remedy this dosha, Gaudapada was enlightened in the Himalayas and preached Advaita to Govinda by attending "nirmanacitta"
 "nirmaanchitt" kii baat sadhana ke kshetra main vishwaason kaa koi sthaan nahin he
 Yes, it proves that either Gaudapada was not an interviewed disciple of Shuk or he was not an interviewed Guru of Govindapada
 goudpad shuk ke saakshaat shishy the yaa nahin iskaa nirnay karnaa asambhav he
 It does not seem appropriate to prove the historicity of Gaudapada in the ancient Puranas
 yadi govindpad ko godpad kaa saakshaat shishy bhi maan len to bhi kai kathinaaiyaan hai
 Shankaracharya's time is often considered to be late 8th century AD
 yadi un dinon ke saamaanya jeevankaal ko 100 varsh kaa bhi maan len to goudpad ko saatvin shatabdi main maananaa padegaa
 But Bhavaviveka or Bhavya, a Buddhist Acharya of the sixth century, in his treatise Madhyamahrya, while discussing Vedanta philosophy, has quoted a story of Gaudapada
 isse yah gyaat hota he ki bhavy ke pehle hi goudpad vedant ke acharya ke rup main pratishthit ho chuke the
 Therefore, the time of Gaudapada should be around 500 AD
 yadi yah sahi he to goudpad govindpad ke saakshaat guru nahin ho sakate
 Shankaracharya has remembered Gaudapada by saying "vedantavidvabhirachayen:"
 pro walesar ne likhaa he ki "goudpad" shabd main prayukt "goud" shabd deshparak he, yah vyaktivishesh kaa naam nahin he
 Advaita Vedanta had two departures - the first Gaud departure which was prevalent in North India and the second Dravid departure, which was founded by Shankar himself
 walesar ke anusaar "goudpad" shabd kaa arth he - goud desh main prachlit vedantashastraparak padshtushtyaatmak granth
 But there is no firm basis for such a far-fetched imagination
 vidhushekhar bhattacharya ne thik hi kaha he ki yadi hamen ek granth praapt hota he to us granth kaa koi ne koi lekhak hona chahie
 On the basis of intimate examination, it can be firmly asserted that all the four episodes of this book of Gaudapada belong to the same author
 parampara is granth ke lekhak ko goudpad naamak vyakti vishesh ko hi granth kaa lekhak maananaa padegaa
 Balakrishnananda Saraswati of the 17th century wrote in a treatise called "shareerak Mimamsa Bhashya Vartik" that some Gaud people lived on the banks of Hiranyavati river in Kurukshetra
 goudpad unheen main se ek the
 But his real name could not be known to the people due to his trance since the beginning of Dwapar
 is anushruti ki aadhaar par goudpad ko kurukshetra ke aasapaas kaa hona chahie
 According to the treatise 'agadguru Ratnamalastava', Gaudapada had contact with the Greeks
 acharya ne inaki puja kii or nishaksiddh aplunya inkaa shishy tha
 There is a great controversy among Greek historians about whether Apollonius came to India and most scholars believe that Apollonius had never visited India
 inhen suni sunai baton ke aadhaar par hi bharat kaa varnan kar diya tha
 Apart from this, there is no mention of Gaudapada in the Greek texts and Bharatavarnas of Apollonius
 goudpad ke vyaktitv ke bare main iske alaava ki ve ek yogi or siddh purush the tathaa gudpadiya karikaon ke karta the, kuch bhi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Gourmet works are in front of us
 in karikaon ko chaar prakarnon main vibhajit kiya gaya he or ye ek hi vyakti kii kriti hai
 Its first episode is called Agama Case
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki is prakaran main manducya upanishad kaa karikamay vyaakhyaan upasthit kiya gaya he
 Agama means it is called Agama Case because it is based on Upanishads
 kuch acharya is prakaran kii karikaon ko "aagam" kehete hai or inako goudpad kii kriti nahin maanate
 Sometimes these karis are combined with the Mandukya Upanishad
 vidhushekhar bhattacharya kaa to kahana he ki ye karikas pehle likhi gayi thim or baad main inhen ke aadhaar par manducya upanishad kii rachana hui
 But this opinion is not rational
 iskaa pramaan is prakaran kii karikaon se hi miltaa he
 These roles are explanatory
 at: manducya upanishad hi inase pehle kaa maaloom padataa he
 In the second episode, the viability or falsity of the world is proved, so its name is the case of Vaitathya
 advait tatv kaa pratipaadan hone ke kaaran teesraa prakaran advait prakaran kehalaata he
 Allatshanti has been called because of the rendering of peace of all false disputes
 vidhushekhar bhattacharya kaa mat he ki ye chaaro prakaran chaar swatantra rachanaayen hai, kisi ek granth ke chaar adhyay nahin, kyonki ye paraspar sambandhit nahin hai
 Also at the beginning of the fourth episode, "tanda vande dvaipadambaram" has been called as the praise of Buddha
 mangalacharan granth ke aarambh main kiya jaataa he, bich main prakaran ke aarambh main mangalacharan nahin dekha gaya he
 Thus, Chaturvakaran is an independent book
 yah mat kuch thik nahin lagata kyonki pehali baat to yah he ki chaaron prakaran ek duusare se sambandhit hai
 In the first case, some principles have been introduced broadly on the basis of the Upanishads, and in the second and third cases, respectively, the falsehood of the world and the state of an invisible element are presented respectively
 chauthaa prakaran upsanhaaratmak he jisamen purvokt teen prakarnon main kahe gaye upanishad anumodith siddhanton kaa buddha dwaara updisht siddhanton se avirodh dikhalaayaa gaya he
 On the basis of this episode, Bhattacharya has called Gaudapada a Buddhist, but if he can be called a Buddhist on the basis of one episode, then he can also be declared Mahavedanti on the basis of the first three episodes
 yah sahi he ki goudpad ke siddhant baudhon ke nikat hai
 Their casteism is based on the secondary method
 inke dwaara pratipaadit aatma kaa swaroop yogacharanumat vigyaan kii anukriti sa maaloom padataa he
 Their rationale is the same as that of secondary nihilists
 unhone buddha kaa bada aadar kiya he
 Despite all this, Gaudapada is pure Vedanti, because - is prasang main yah dhyaan dena avashyak he ki goudpad na to keval madhyamik siddhaton ke anuyaayi hai or na shuddhat: yogachaar darshan ke
 Where he found logical reasoning, he received it
 unhone sarvada yah dikhaane kaa praytn kiya ki buddha vichaardhaara or aupnishadik vichaardhaara main tatvat: koi virodh nahin he
 What is opposed is ignorant
 goudpad kii bhartiya darshan ko dein he
 Shankaracharya adopted this path of co-ordination and established his Advaita faith, but his original philosophy was Gaudpadi
 isi kaaran goudpad apana avirodh darshan pratishthapit karne ke liye hi buddha ko namaskara karte hai at: yah namaskara mangalacharan ke rup main nahin granth ke pratipaadya vishay ke rup main sweekrut kiya janaa chahie
 In this philosophy it seems that logic is not given as much space as interview and experience
 yoga kaa maarg hi pramukh maarg he at: us maarg main tarkjanya virodh ko koi sthaan nahin hona chahie
 Just as the word "paad" comes at the end of the names of the Siddhas - Gunduripa, Sirhapa etc
 - Similarly, the use of the word Paad in Gaudapada's name also points to the association of Gaudapada with the Siddhas
 sarhapaad ke dohon tathaa goudpad kii karikaon main samanta bhi darshneey he
 May be Gaudapada is the link between Buddhist and non-buddhist cults
 is karikagranth ke atirikt sankhyakarika ke upar bhashya bhi goudpad kaa mana jaataa he
 His compositions are also called Uttaragitabhashya, Nrisinhapatini Upanishad and Durgasaptashati's commentary, Subhagodaya and Srividyaratnasutra
 poornima shreshth ek prasiddh bollywood parshv gayika he jinhone bhartiya sangeet udyogon main kai superhit gane gaae hai

 satyagrah ashram kii sthapana san 1917 main ahmedabad ke kocharab naamak sthaan main mahatma gandhi dwaara hui thi
 In 1917, this ashram shifted to the present location on the banks of the Sabarmati River and since then it came to be known as Sabarmati Ashram
 ashram ke vartmaan sthaan ke sambandh main itihaaskaaron kaa mat he ki puranic dadhichi rishi kaa ashram bhi yahi par tha
 The ashram is situated in the cool shade of trees

 The Ashram has been an inspiration to the Indian public and Indian leaders and a focal point of work related to India's freedom struggle
 katai evam bunai ke saath-saath charkhe ke bhaagon kaa nirmaan kaary bhi dhire-dhire is ashram main hone laga
 While in the ashram, Gandhi successfully conducted the strike in the mills of Ahmedabad
 mil maalik evam karmchaariyon ke vivaad ko sulajhane ke liye gandhi ji ne anaan aarambh kar diya tha, jiske prabhaav se 21 dinon se chal rahi hadtaal teen dinon ke anaan se hi samaapt ho gai
 After this success, Gandhiji started the Kheda Satyagraha while staying in the ashram
 ralett samiti kii sifri kaa virodh karne ke liye gandhi ji ne yahan tatkaaleen rashtriya netaaon kaa ek sammelan yojit kiya or sabhi upasthit logon ne satyagrah ke pratigya patr har hastakshar kiye
 While staying at the Sabarmati Ashram, Mahatma Gandhi wrote a letter to the Viceroy of India on 2 March 1930 informing him that he was going to start a nine-day civil disobedience movement
 12 march 1930 i
 ko mahatma gandhi ne ashram ke anya 78 vyaktiyon ke saath namak kanoon bhang karne ke liye aitihaasik dandi yatra kii
 After this, Gandhiji did not return here until India became independent
 uparyukt andolan kaa daman karne ke liye sarkaar ne andolankariyon kii sampatti jabt kar lee
 Inspired by sympathy for the agitators, Gandhiji asked the government to take the Sabarmati Ashram, but the government did not do so, yet Gandhiji left the ashrams to leave the ashram and settle at Rasagram near Birsad in Kheda district of Gujarat
 Done, but before the ashram dwellers left the ashram, on 1 August 1933
 All were arrested
 mahatma gandhi ne is ashram ko bhang kar diya
 The ashram remained vacant for some time
 baad main yah nirnay kiya gaya ki harijanon tathaa pichde virgon ke kalyaan ke liye shiksha evam shiksha sambandhi sansthaaon ko chalaaya jaae or is kaary ke liye ashram ko ek nyaas ke adheen kar diya jaae
 After the death of Gandhi, a national monument was established with a view to preserving his memory continuously
 sabarmati ashram gandhi ji ke netritv ke aarambh kaal se hi sambandhit he, at: gandhi-smarak-nidhi naamak sanghathan ne yah nirnay kiya ki ashram ke un bhawanon ko, jo gandhi ji se sambandhit the, surakshit rakhaa jaae
 Therefore, in 1951, the Sabarmati Ashram Security and Memorial Trust came into existence
 usee samay se yah nyaas mahatma gandhi ke nivas, hridayakunj, upasnabhumi naamak prarthanasthal or magan nivas kii suraksha ke liye kaary kar rahaa he

 Partial reason for this increase is the increasing popularity of fertility drugs such as clomid and test tube fertilization, due to which multiple births are often more frequent than fertility without external support

 Due to the widespread use of fertility drugs, which some people call an "epidemic of multiple births", is spreading
 2001 main, america main pehali baar, judawaan bacchon kii janm dar sabhi janmon se 3% adhik ho gai
 Nevertheless, the worldwide birth rate of monozygotic twins remains 1 in 333

 This can depend on what type of fertility treatment has been done

 The delivery interval between twins was measured as follows: adhyayan main kaha gaya ki "ek se dusre judawaan ke prasav samay interval main vruddi kaa hona" jatiltaaon ke badhane se judaa paaya gaya tha or suzav diya ki interval kam rakhaa jaae, haalanki yah ullekhneey he ki adhyayan ne jatiltaaon ke kaarnon kii jaanch nahin kii thi or dai ke anubhav kaa str, mahilaon kii janm dene kii ichha, yaa duusare judawaan ko janm dene kii 'prabandhan ranneeti" jaise karkon par niyantran nahin kiya tha

 a chimera is an ordinary person or animal in which some organs, by exception, are actually from its twin or mother
 ek chimera yaa to ekayugmanaj judawaan bhrun se paidaa hota he, yaa dviyugmanaj bhrunon se, jisame sharir ke vibhinn bhaagon se gunasutra tulana dwaara pahchaan kii ja sakati he
 Cells derived from each embryo can vary from one part of the body to another, and this often leads to an increase in the characteristics of skin color in human chimeras
 chimera intersex arthath purush judawaan or mahila judawaan kii koshikaon se nirmit ho saktaa he
 In addition, in some cases the individual or chimera may have two sets of DNA

 One fetus behaves like a parasite to another
 kabhi kabhi paraseete judawaan duusare kaa lagbhag aprabhedya hissaa ban jaataa he or kabhi kabhi iske saath chikitsa dwaara nipta jaataa he
 Parasites are a very rare type of twins in which only one viable twin is endangered when another zygote becomes a cancer factor or molar
 iskaa matlab yah he ki ekayugmanaj kaa koshika vibhaajan aniyantrit rup se jari rahata he, jo ek vyavhaarya bhrun se bad kar ek cancer vruddhi kaa rup le letaa he
 Typically, this occurs when a twin has triploidy or has a full parenchymal umbilical cord elevated, resulting in a small embryo or no fetus and a carcinogenic, much larger fetal-like structure that resembles grape bunches
 
 kabhi kabhi, ek aurat ko garbhavastha ke dauraan garbhpaat hojaataa he, phir bhi garbhavastha jari rahati he; ek judawaan kaa garbhpaat ho gaya tha, lekin doosraa apni avadhi puri karne main sakasham rata he
 This phenomenon is similar to Vanishing twin syndrome, but usually occurs after Vanishing twin syndrome

 Twins on average are relatively small in singleton throughout their lifetime
 ekayugmanaj judawaan bacchon main, jo ek naal se jude hote hai, twin-tu-tvi
 is avasthaa kaa arth he ki ek judawaan se khun duusare judawaan ko bant jaataa he
 One twin, the 'donor' twin, is small and anemic and the other recipient twin is large and polycythemic
 is haalat se donon judwa bacchon kaa jivan khatre main pad jaataa hai
 The study of twins is used to determine how much genetics or environmental influences are attributable to a particular trait
 ye adhyayan ekayugmanaj or dviyugmanaj judawaan bacchon kii chikitsiya, anuvaanshik yaa manovaigyanik visheshtaon kii tulana karke yah prayaas karte hai ki jin abhivyaktiyon yaa paryaavarniya prabhaav se anuvanshiki prabhaav ko alag kar saken

 However, the usefulness and accuracy of the study of these twins has been questioned and remains controversial

 In rare cases, eggs are fertilized at different times due to sex between two or more times, between twins, twins either in the same menstrual cycle or, more rarely, after pregnancy
 Occurs in phase
 As a result, a woman becomes more likely to have fraternal twins from different fathers
 This phenomenon is known as hetropaiternal superfiction
 1992 ke ek adhyayan kaa anumaan he ki dviyugmanaj judawaan bacchon main hetropaternal superficndation kii aavruti, jinke abhibhavak pitrutv mukaddamon main shaamil the, lagbhag 2

 asthanik garbhadhaaran kaa avashya hi nidaan kiya janaa chahie kyonki ve maa ke liye jaanaleva ho sakate hai
 However, in most cases, intrauterine pregnancy can be avoided
 atyant durlabh maamalon main, ekayugmanaj judawaan bacchon main, judwa bachche vipareet lingon ke saath paidaa hote hai
 The likelihood of this is so low that multiple babies born with different sexes have been accepted worldwide for medical research on the solid basis that multiple children in the uterus are not monozygous
 jab ekayugmanaj judawaan alag lingon ke saath paidaa hote hai to aisa gunasutra janm dosha ke kaaran hota he
 In this case, although the twins come from the same egg, it is incorrect to call them genetically identical, since they have different karyotypes
 ekayugmanaj alag alag jeenon ke sakriy hone ke kaaran alag alag tareekon se viksit ho sakate hai
 "semi-identical twins" are more unusual
 ye "aadhe-samaan judawaan" bacchon kii pariklpana tab hoti he jab ek anishechit anda do samaan ova main vibhakt ho jaataa he tathaa ye ova nishechan ke anukool hote hai
 Both cloned ova are fertilized by different spermatozoa and these eggs organize into chimeric blastomers and undergo another cell duplication
 yadi yah blostomer ek judawaan ghatana ke rup main badal jaae, to do bhrun banenge, jinamein se prayek kaa alag paitruk jin or samaan matra jin hoga
 As a result, twins will be born with identical genes from the mother's side but with different genes from the father's side
 prayek bhrun kii koshikaayen kisi bhi shukranu se jin grahan karengi, jiske parinamswaroop chimera bachche honge
 Until recently it was recorded in Western medicine, there was speculation about this variety

 Hindi-poetry was composed initially in Brajbhasha itself
 sabhi bhakt kaviyon, reetikalin kaviyon ne apni rachanaaen isi bhashaa main likhi hai jinamein pramukh hai surdaas, rahim, raskhaan, keshav, ghananand, bihari, ityadi
 In terms of language and style, there was a wide area of shaurseni or Western apostrophes
 brajabhasha ko ek prakaar se isi vyapak kshetra kii seemayen viraasat main mili thim
 The style-form of Brajbhasha touches boundaries far beyond the language-field
 kuch lekhakon ne brajabhasha naam se uske kshetra-vistaar kaa kathan kiya he
 Surajmal, the author of 'vansh Bhaskar', is considered to be between Braj Bhasha Pradesh Delhi and Gwalior
 'tuhaftul hind' ke rachayita mirza khan ne brajabhasha ke kshetra kaa ullekh is prakaar kiya he "bhashaa' braj tathaa uske paas-pados main boli jaati he
 Gwalior and Chandwar are also included in it
 ganga-yamuna kaa doaab bhi brajabhasha kaa kshetra he
 According to Lallujilal, the area of brajbhasha is "brajbhasha", which is the language spoken in Braj, District Gwalior, Bharatpur, Bateshwar, Bhadavar, Antveda and Bundelkhand
 isamen shabd mathura kshetra kaa vaachak he
 'lallujilal has also written that the Braj language of Braj and Gwalior is pure and refined
 grearsan ne brajabhasha-seemayen is prakaar likhi hai
 "mathura is the center

 ' kelaag ne likhaa he ki raajapootaana kii boliyon ke uttar-purv, puure apper doaab tathaa ganga-yamuna kii ghaatiyon main brajabhasha boli jaati he
 Dr
 Dhirendra Verma has not considered the Kannauji area specified by Grierson as distinct from the area of briji
 apane surveykshan ke aadhaar par unhone kanpur tak, brajbhaashi kshetra hi kaha he
 According to him, the districts of Mathura, Aligarh, Agra, Bulandshahar, Etah, Mainpuri, Badaun and Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh - eastern part of Punjab and Gurgaon district - Bharatpur, Dhaulpur, Karauli in Rajasthan and eastern part of Jaipur - Gwalior in central India
 The western part of the region falls in the Briji region
 chunki grearsan sahab kaa yah mat lekhak ko maanya nahin ki kannauji swatantra boli he, isliye uttar pradesh ke pilibhit, shahjahanpur, farrukhabad, hardoi, itawa or kanpur ke jile bhi brajabhasha kshetra main sammilit kar liye hai
 The area of brajbhasha spoken thus becomes extremely wide
 ek prakaar se pracheen madhyadesh kaa adhikansh bhaag isamen sammilit ho jaataa he
 Braj Bhasha became distinguished as poetry
 kai shatabdiyon tak isamen kavy- rachana hoti rahi
 Violation of the boundaries of the general Braj Bhasha-region created a greater area of braj Bhasha-style
 is baat kaa anumaan reetikaal ke kavi acharya bhikharidasji ne kiya
 He clearly stated that the introduction of Brajbhasha can also be found from poets living outside Braj
 yah nahin samajhnaa chahie ki brajabhasha madhur- sundar he
 Not only Sanskrit and Farsi, other languages also have a mix with it
 phir bhi brajabhasha style kaa vaishishty prakat rahata he
 This also proves that Braj Bhasha style was integrated with many languages
 vastav main 16veen shatee ke madhya tak brajabhasha kii mishrit style saare madhyadesh kii kavy-bhashaa ban gai thi
 Bhakti movement was also involved in expansion

 Pt
 Vishwanath Prasad Mishra has revealed the geographical location of Braj Bhakta-poets of many states in this way - "braj's descendant - Meera dancing with unique sound of his footsteps with sound was from Rajasthan, Namdev was from Maharashtra, Narsi was from Gujarat, Bharatendu Harishchandra was from Bhojpuri language area

 Earlier poets of Bengal also wrote poetry in Brajbhasha
 ' In the west, Rajasthan continued to use Brajbhasha styles in abundance, and in the west, Brajbhasha style was also extended to Gujarat and Kutch

 In Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kathiawad and Kutch etc
 Brajbhasha compositions were also done
 brajabhasha style ke kshetra vistaar kii do sthitiyaan raheen
 The first situation arose from the sequence of language scientific history
 jab pashchimi yaa madhyadeshiy bhashaa anek kaarnon se apni bhugolic simaaon kaa ulanghan karne lagi, tab sthaneey rupon se samanvit hokar, vah ek visisth bhashaa style kaa rup grahan karne lagi
 Areas in which this text, rather than the language of language, have been molded into artificial, mixed and specific forms used only in literature, and have become embedded in specific occasions, contexts or poetic forms, will be considered as genre areas
 style-kshetra purvayugin bhashaa-vistaar yaa style-vistaar ke sahare badhata he
 The later forms of Western or Madhyapriya Apabhramsa expanded in this way

 He recorded an experimental song with Cyril Rawson, which was unsuccessful
 Part of the reason was Twain's desire to make a rock singer and not a regional singer
 Five months later, she returned to Canada and moved to a flat in downtown Kirkland with Ballet

 Bell recognized both Twain's ability and form, and the two began secretly meeting, despite their contrasting backgrounds
 Towards the end of 1986, Twain began to express her desire to be a pop or rock singer rather than a regional, which led to her break with Marie Ballet for two years and to no avail
 He got his first chance on February 8, 1987, when Bell staged an event to raise funds for the National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation at Toronto's Roy Thompson Hall, in which Twain featured Broadway artists Bernadette Peters, jazz guitarist Don Ross and the Toronto Symphony Performed with the orchestra
 His performance received some praise, but this made it clear to Bell, who hates pop music, that Twain should stay away from it and focus on regional music

 Its value is related to the vacuum's electric constant ε 0 { \ displaystyle \ varepsilon _ {0} \ , \ !} And the magnetic constant μ 0 { \ displaystyle \ mu _ {0} \ , \ !} Which is as follows: satrahavin sadi ke madhya tak dharna yah thi ki prakaash kaa veg anant hota he, arthath use ek sthaan se duusare sthaan par pahunchne main kuch bhi samay nahin lagata
 Galileo attempted to measure the speed of light, but in his experiment, he failed to measure the speed of light due to human-reaction error
 In September 1676 Roemer stated that the velocity of light is 'finite' despite being intense
