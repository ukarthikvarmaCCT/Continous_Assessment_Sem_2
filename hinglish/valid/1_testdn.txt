 The Dorsets are described in modern Inuit mythology, in which they are called a 'bhimakaya' or 'demonic' caste
 is se itihaaskaar andaaza lagate hai ki dorset log kad-but main zarur thulon se bade rahe honge
 After spreading across the snowy areas of northern Canada, the Inuit, descendants of these Thuels, had also reached Greenland by 1300 AD

 From these, the castes living in the south could never permanently control their territories, nor could the Inuit spread to the less cold areas of the sub-arctic regions to the south
 phir bhi ve apane dakshini padosiyon ke saath vyapaar karte the or unase ladaai-jhadpen hoti rahati thim
 In the same period 1000-1300 AD, they also got contact with the Viking race of Northern Europe

 iske chalate pavitra koran main donon pakshon se baat-chit yaa sulah kaa prayaas kiye bina die gaye talaaq kaa zikr kahin bhi nahin miltaa
 Similarly, the time period of the divorce process is also clearly stated in the Holy Qur'an
 ek hi kshan main talaaq kaa sawaal hi nahin uthta
 Islam does not permit one-sided and verbal or informally written divorce by writing letters, over the telephone or in modern day via email, SMS or whatsapp

 So they named these particles ATOMS which is inspired by a Greek word ATOMOS which means inseparable
 By the end of the 19th century, however, scientists had come to know that ATOMS is not the original particle of the phenomenon, but rather the organization of even smaller particles

 These experiments also led to the development of nuclear weapons
 Between 1950 and 1960, many different particles were discovered in different experiments, also known as particle zoo, after the term particle zoo became a standard model in 1970
 In this standard model, almost all the particles were defined by some basic particles

 John Dryden was an Anglo poet, literary critic and playwright
 1668 main use rashtrakavi banaaya gaya
 John Dryden was born on August 9, 1931, in a place called Aldwinkill, Northamptonshire
 uskaa shishav tikmarsh main vyateet hua jahaan uske naanaa reverend henry pickring kii sampatti thi
 He got his early education in the Westminster School run by the renowned Dr
 Buswi and earned his BA in 1654 from Trinity College, Cambridge
 usee varsh uske pita kaa dehavsaan hua
 From 1657, he lived in London
 dryden raajakavi or itihaas lekhak ghoshit kiya gaya tathaa ek sau pound kii pension bhi use sweekrut hui
 In 1683, he was appointed as Collector and Custom in a part of London
 1685 main james dwitiya ke rajarohan par dryden ne england ke carch kaa bahishkaar kar cathelic dharm kii sweekaar kiya
 The rejection of leaving Catholicism and swearing allegiance to William III in the Revolution of 1668 led to the wrath of the Drydeg state and all its posts and pensions were stripped
 uskaa dahaanth 1700 ke may diwas par gathiya rog se hua or westomister abe main use dafnaaya gaya
 Dryden's first contribution to English poetry was a poem he composed in 1649 in memory of his classmate Young Lord Hastiges
 us samay vah keval 18 varsh kaa tha
 This poem is written following the method of spiritual poems of Dun and Cleveland
 kintu 1659 main prakashit kramwel kii mrityu par rachit uske heroik stejon main pravaah kii kuch kami hote hue bhi saahitiyik saushthav he
 His restorative commendatory poems, which begin with 'astrea Redux' in 1660 and end with 'annus Mirabilis' in 1667, demonstrate his unprecedented and surprising hegemony over the poetry genre
 kuch aswabhaavik chitron tathaa anaavashyak alankrita shabd vinyas ke hote hue bhi ennas mirabilis apni shashakt dhwani, kavyochit abhivyakti evam sangitatmak gunon ke kaaran ek vilakshan kriti he
 Dryden was busy with theatrical composition for many years
 usne swayan sweekaar kiya he ki is prakaar kii rachanaaon ko vah ghrunit samajhataa tha or keval aarthik laabh ke liye vah waisi rachana karata tha
 Between 1663 and 1694, Dryden composed all seven comedies, five heroic plays, four triumphal comedies and four tragadic compositions, including his first comedy The Wild Gallant and his final play Love Tempent
 ukt kritiyon main, heroik kapalats main likhaa hua pramukh naatak conswest ov grenada, sarvaadhik ullaspurn kamedi marriage-e-laa mod tukyukt kapalate main likhit uski antim tragdi aurangzeb, blancovers main nirmit uskaa pratham or sarvshereshth naatak aal for lav, tathaa usee padhyapaddati par rachit uski don sivastian naamak tragdi uski shreshth rachanaayen hai
 Don Sivastian can be placed on par with his best-known drama All for Love, but it is even better in terms of plot depth and composition
 yadhyapi naatak ke kshetra main dryden ne nihsandeh mahatvapurn kaary kiya kintu uski purna sarjanaatmak shakti uske 50wein varsh main prakashit granth avsaalam and ekitafail main prasphutit hui jo apane tikshn buddhi vilaas, jajvalyamaan shabdayojna, praharatmak akshep evam vyangatmak chithran ke liye ek adbhut rachana he or angreji bhashaa main sabase mahaan raajnneetik vyangyakavy he
 After this, 'the Medal' was published in 1682, which is a direct attack on the democratic policy
 taduparant usee varsh mike 'flepanon prakaash' main aayaa, jo angreji bhashaa ke vyaktipradhan vyangakaavyon main apana sheershasth sthaan rakhata he
 In it, 'the Medal of John Weyes', composed by Tomas Shedwell, is a powerful and bitter answer to the allegations made by the husband of his book The Medal
 'heroik kapalats' se vilsit vyangakavy main niojit kavy-katha kaa yah pratham udhaaharan he or pope ke 'dunsiod' kaa sanket prastut karata he
 It was only in 1682 that the Religiolaiso was published in which the firm support of the Protestant Church of England and against theism is presented clearly and sharply
 'di hind and di panther' jisamen dryden ke catholic dharm kii ore parivartit vichaardhaara kaa nyyochit nideshan he, dryden kaa suprasiddh dharmik ghoshnaptr he or apni spashtataa, tarkpaddati evam nishkapatata ke liye isaki adhik khyaati he
 It is the quintessential religious satire in the English language
 adwitiya dakshata or jwalanth shakti se ot prot akshep, uttejnaa or tak kii uddeshypurti ke liye in sabhi kavitaaon kii rachana tukamukt heroik kapalate main hi hui he
 Dryden's poetry is a neglect of lyrical elements
 uske naatakantargat geeton main asaadhaaran vaividhya or aakarshan he
 His 'odds to the Pius Menary of Mrs
 Any Killigrew', 'A Song for St
 Cecilia's Day' and 'alexander's Feast' have been decent and flowy
 kranti ke baad praaia: das varsho tak dryden ucch koti ke granthen ko anudit karne main laga rahaa or usne virgil tathaa juvenal kaa mahatvapun anuwaad prastut kiya

 Ilit has written, Dryden has contributed to the creation and growth of the English language by his translated and original works
 san 1700 main apni mrityu ke kuch hi samay pehle usne 'febul ensheynt and marden' kii rachana kii jisamen homer, aavid bokaishio or chosar kii kahaniyon ko padhyabaddh prastut kiya gaya he
 Although these stories are written in Dryden's old age, ill-health and adversity, he is counted among the best storytellers in the English verse
 dryden kii gadhyrachana main mukhyat: uske niabandh or bhoomikaaye hai jo kavy or naatay sambandhi vividh samasyaon se sambandhit hai
 This first great English critic is one of the founders of modern English prose
 barnard sha ko chhodkar yah bhoomikaaon kaa sarvshereshth lekhak he
 Essay of Dramatic Poetry is Dryden's high-quality criticism of the play
 chaar paatro ke parsparik samvaad ke rup main likhi gai is samikshapusttak main, jisamen ek paatr swayan dryden he, pracheen or arvachin sahityakaron tathaa mukt chand or tuk yukt chand ke saapekshik gun-dosha kaa vivechan he
 From the beginning to the end, this book is full of such places that express the author's uncommon merit and his subtle observation of literary evaluation
 dryden apane yug kaa sarvshereshth bauddhik or sarvatomukhi pratibhasampann ojasvi pratinidhi he

 These incoming Twelfth Imam are called 'mahdi'
 puure shiya samudaay main se lagbhag 85% barahave shiya hi hote hai
 The twelfth Shi'a beliefs come from other related communities such as Zaidi Shia and Ismaili Shia although they disagree about the number of Imams and the succession of one Imam to the next Imam

 ) It is clear from this that there have been methods of measurement in India since very ancient times
 prachlit jaankaree ke anusaar sindhu ghati kii puratathvik khudaai main mili naaptul ke vibhinn avasheshon se gyaat hota he ki isa purv 3000-1500 main sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nivaasiyon ne maanakeekaran kii ek parishkrut pranali viksit kiya tha
 This metaphorical method of the Indus Valley Civilization is considered one of the oldest in the world

 khagolavidon evam ganitagyon ne maapan ke liye aavashyak yantron kaa bhi vikaas kiya tha jinka parichay yantraraj, yantrashiromani, yantrarnav ityadi granthon main diya gaya he
 In the medieval era, the Mughal emperor Akbar also developed a uniform system of measurement which was used throughout the country
 abul fazal rachit aaine akabari ke anusaar us kaal main bhoomi naapane kii ikai “ilaahi gaj” hua karti thi jo ki vartmaan 33 inch se 34 ke baraabar thi
 The unit of weight measurement used to be "ser"
