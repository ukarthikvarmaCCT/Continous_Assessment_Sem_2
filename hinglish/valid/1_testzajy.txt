 Macro cells can be considered cells where the base station antenna is installed on a pillar or building whose height is higher than the average roof
 Micro cells are those whose antenna height is less than the average ceiling height; They are commonly used in urban areas
 pico cell aise chote cell hai jinka vistaar-vyas kuch darjan meter hi hota he; inkaa upyog mukhya rup se bhawan ke andar kiya jaataa he
 Femto cells are cells that are envisaged for use in residential or small business environments and connected to a service provider's network through a broadband Internet connection
 ambrella cell kaa upyog, chote cell ke chaaya-kshetron ko dhakne or un selon ke bich kii khaali jagah ko bharne ke liye hota he
 The horizontal half-diameter of the cell varies from hundreds of meters to several kilometers depending on the height of the antenna, antenna gain and transmission environment

 The coverage inside the building is also supported by GSM and can be achieved by using an in-door picocell base station or through an inverter repeater with an internal antenna supplied by an energy breaker, so that the radio signal from the external antenna is distributed separately inside the building
 To be delivered to the system
 These are usually expanded when there is a need for excessive call capacity indoors; For example at large shops or airports
 However, this is not a pre-requisite, as internal coverage is provided by the entry of radio signals from a nearby cell within the building
 jiesem main prayukt adhimishran gausian nunatam-antaran sangyojan he, jo ek prakaar kaa satat-charan fricvency antaran sangyojan he
 In GMSK, the signal to be modulated on the carrier is sweetened with Gaussian low-pass filters prior to supply on the frequency modulator, greatly reducing the risk of interference from neighboring vessels

 GSM networks operate in many different frequency extension ranges
 Most 2G GSM networks operate on the 900 mhz or 1800 mhz band
 kuch amareeki desh 850 mhz or 1900 mhz kaa prayog karte hai, kyonki 900 or 1800 mhz fricvency band pehle hi abantit kiye gaye the
 Most of the 3G GSM networks in Europe operate in the 2100 mhz frequency band
 kuch deshon main durlabh 400 or 450 mhz fricvency band nirdisht kiye gaye hai, jahaan in fricvensiyon kaa upyog pehali peedi kii pranaaliyon ke liye ho rahaa tha
 The GSM-900 uses 890–915 mhz to transmit base station information from the mobile station and 935–960 mhz for other directions, providing 125 RF channels at intervals of 200 khz
 45 mhz kaa duplex antaraal prayukt hota he
 In some countries the GSM-900 band has been expanded to cover a greater frequency zone
 yah mul GSM-900 band main 50 channel jodate hue 'vistrut GSM', E-GSM, 880–915 mhz tathaa 925–960 mhz kaa upyog karata he
 Time division multiplexing is used to allow eight full-rate or sixteen half-rate speech channels per radio frequency channel
 TDMA frem main aath radio samyavadhi samahit hai
 Half-rate channels use alternate frames in the same timeframe
 sabhi 8 channelon ke liye channel data dar 270
833 kbit / s or frem avadhi 4,615 ms hai
 The transmission power of this handset is a maximum of 2 watts in GSM850 / 900 and 1 watt in GSM1800 / 1900
 GSM ne 5
6 tathaa 13 kbit / s ke bich dhwani ko sankuchit karne ke liye kai prakaar ke dhwani kodak kaa istemaal kiya he
 Originally two codecs, namely half-rate and full-rate, have been named based on the type of data channel allocated to them
 inamen ek aisi pranali kaa prayog hua he, jo rekhiy purvakathaneey koding par aadhaarit hoti he
 In addition to being effective towards bitrates, these codecs have made it much easier to identify the more important parts of the sound, making it easier for the air interface layer to preserve and prioritize these signals
 GSM ko 1997 main purna dar channel kaa upyog karne vaale vardhit purna dar kodak, ek 12
2 kbit / s kodak, main viksit kiya gaya
 Finally, with the development of UMTS the EFR was revamped as a variable-rate codec, called amr-narrowband, which is high-quality and robust to interference when used on full-rate channels, as well as, when It is used on a half-rate channel in good radio conditions, so it is less robust but of relatively high quality

 One of the key features of GSM is the Subscriber Identity Module, commonly known as a SIM card
 SIM ek alag kiya ja sakane vaala smart card he, jisamen upyogkarta kii sadsyta-jaankaree or phone book hota he
 This allows the user to store their information even after changing the handset
 vaikalpik rup se, upyogkarta oparator badalane ke liye bina apana handset badale, keval SIM badal kar aisa kar saktaa he
 Some operators interrupt this action by allowing a single SIM in a phone or only by a SIM given by them; This practice is called SIM locking and in some countries it is illegal
 australia, uttari america or europe main kai oparator un mobile ko lock kar dete hai, jinhen ve bechate hai
 This is done because mobile phone prices are generally discounted at the time of subscription and operators want to avoid any concession on their competitors' mobiles
 ek graahak aam taur par kuch shulk dekar is baadha ko dur karne ke liye pradaata se sampark kar saktaa he, yaa phir vah nijee sevaaon ke zariye block ko khol saktaa he, yaa internet par uplabdh tamaam software or web-site kaa upyog karke bhi vah apane handset kaa block khol saktaa he
 Although most web-sites ask for some fee in lieu of block removal, some do so for free
 yah loking handset par lagu hota he, jo uske antarrashtriya mobile upkaran pahchaan sankhya se janaa jaataa he, naa ki khate par In some countries like Bangladesh, Belgium, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Pakistan, all phones are sold without lock
 tathaapi, belgium main operataron dwaara phone kii qeemat par kisi prakaar kii sabsidi dena gair-kanoonee he
 This was also the case in Finland until 1 April 2006, after which it became legal to sell subsidized handsets and accounts, although operators have to open the phone after a certain amount of time without charge
 GSM ko madhyam str kii suraksha ke saath dizine kiya gaya tha
 The system was designed to ensure the user's identity using a pre-shared key and challenge-response
 upyogkarta or base stesan ke bich ke samvaad ko kutabaddh kiya ja saktaa he
 The development of UMTS promotes an alternative USIM, which uses a longer identification key to provide greater security, as well as authenticate the user and network - while GSM only authenticates the user in front of the network
 The security model therefore offers privacy and authentication, but with limited authorization capabilities and without disclaimers
 GSM uses several cryptographic algorithms for security
 A5 / 1 or A5 / 2 stream bijlekh kaa prayog hawa ke upar aawaaj kii gopneeyata sunishchit karne ke liye hota he
 A5 / 1 was developed earlier and is a strong cypher used in Europe and America; A5 / 2 is a bit weak and is used in other countries
 donon bijlekh main gambhir kamajoriyaan pai gai hai: vaastavik samay main A5 / 2 ko keval-bijlekh hamale se toda ja saktaa he or farvari 2008 main, Pico, Computing, Inc ne FPGA kaa labhonmukh kshamta or yojana ko prakat kiya, jiske dwaara A5 / 1 ko renbo teble hamale se toda ja saktaa he
 This system supports several algorithms, allowing operators to replace that cipher with a stronger version

 isse krodhit bachade ne kaha ki vah brahman kii hatya kar degaa
 At this, Gau Mata refused the calf to do so, because the calf would have committed the sin of killing Brahma

 Several environmental factors affect blood pressure
 jivan style se sambandhit kuch kaarak hai jo raktchaap kam karte hai jinamein aahaar main namak kii maatra kam karnaa, fal or kam vasa vaale utpaadon ko aahaar main badhanaa shaamil hai
 Exercise, weight loss and low alcohol consumption also help in lowering blood pressure
 anya karkon jaise tanaav, caffeine kii khapat, or vitamin di kii kami kii sambhavit bhoomika, kam spasht he
 Insulin resistance, which is common in obesity and a component of syndrome X, is also believed to contribute to hypertension
 haal ke adhyayanon se yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki praarambhik jivan kii ghatnaayen aavashyak ucch-raktchaap ke liye jokhim kaarak hoti hai
 However, the mechanisms linking these risks to the problem of hypertension in adults are unclear
 dwitiyak ucch raktchaap kisi pahachaane ja sakane vaale kaaran kaa parinaam he
 Kidney disease is the most common among the secondary causes of hypertension
 ucch raktchaap, antahsravi sthitiyon jaise kushing syndrome, hyperthyradism, hypothyradism, echromigeli, con syndrome yaa hikereldostronism tathaa hyperparathyrirodism yaa fiochromocytoma ke kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Other causes of secondary hypertension include obesity, sleep apnea, pregnancy, aortic shrinkage, excessive licorice consumption and some prescription drugs, herbal remedies, and illicit drugs
 sthapit moolbhoot ucch raktchaap vaale zyaadaatar logon main, cardiyak output saamaanya rahete huye rakt pravaah kaa badha hua pratirodh ucch dabaav ke liye jimmedaar hota he
 There is evidence that some young people with pre-hypertension or "borderline hypertension" have higher cardiac output, higher heart rate, and general peripheral resistance
 is sthiti ko hyperkainetic simavarti ucch raktchaap kaha jaataa he
 Typical symptoms of established hypertension develop in these individuals later in life as their cardiac output falls and peripheral resistance increases as they age
 yah vivaad kaa vishay he ki yah pattern un sabhi logon par lagu hota he nahin jinamein antat ucch raktchaap kaa vikaas ho jaataa he
 The increased peripheral resistance in established hypertension is mainly due to the structural narrowing of the small arteries and arteries
 keshikaon kii sankhya yaa ghanatv main kami bhi paridhiy pratirodh main yogadan kar sakati he
 High blood pressure is also associated with a lack of flexibility in peripheral nerves, which can increase the return of blood to the heart, increase cardiac preload, and eventually lead to diastolic abnormality
 rakt vahikaaon kaa sakriy sankuchan sthapit moolbhoot ucch raktchaap main bhoomika nibhaataa he yaa nahin yah spasht nahin he
 The pulse pressure is often increased in the elderly with hypertension
 is sthiti main aisa systolic dabaav ho saktaa he jo ki asaamaanya rup se ucch ho, lekin diastolic dabaav saamaanya yaa kam ho saktaa he
 This condition is called isolated systolic blood pressure
 bujurg logon main ucch raktchaap yaa pruthak systolic ucch raktchaap ke saath ucch naadee dabaav ko badi huyi dhamneey kathorta dwaara samajha ja saktaa he jo aam taur par umr badhane ke saath juda hua he or ucch raktchaap ke dwaara or bighad saktaa he
 Several mechanisms have been proposed to increase the resistance seen within the arterial system in hypertension
 adhikansh sakshya in kaarnon main se ek yaa donon kii ore ishaara karte hai: These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and it is likely that both are responsible to some extent in most cases of basic hypertension
 yah bhi sujhaayaa gaya he ki endothelial asamaanyata or sanvahani sujan bhi bade huye paridhiy pratirodh or ucch raktchaap main sanvahani kshati ke liye yogadan kar sakate hai
 Hypertension is diagnosed when the patient is suffering from persistent hypertension

 Teak also occurs in Burma, Thailand and Java
 uparyukt vrikshon ke atirikt or bhi anek vriksh hai, jinaki lakadiyaan kisi vishisht uddeshy ke liye atyant upyukt hoti hai, jaise babul kii lakdi pahiyon ke liye or gooler kii lakdi kuon ke chakke ke liye
 The trunk and branches only grow towards the front end

 The base of this growth is a very thin layer between the bark and wood called Edha
 edha pehle se maujuud lakdi ke baahar nai parat jamaa karti rahati he
 In cold and temperate regions, this activity occurs only in the spring and summer, and idle remains dormant during winter, or autumn
 isliye varsh ke aarambh main utpann lakdi se baad main utpann lakdi bhinn hoti he
 As a result, each year's wood is different in the form of a ring
 ye challe vaarshik valay kehalaate hai or lakdi ko aadi kaatane par spasht dekhe ja sakate hai
 By counting these, the age of the cut tree can be estimated
 ek vishesh aayu praapt hone par lakdi kaa rang gaharaa hone lagata he
 The part that becomes darker is called the inner wood and the remaining outer part is the rasakastha
 raskashtha kaa ant:kashtha main shanai:-shanai: parivartan bahut mahatvapurn he
 This only happens in living trees
 is prakaar yah parivartan lakdi ke us upachaar, yaa pakaai se bhinn hota he, jo lakdi kaatane ke baad kii jaati he
 The cells of the spermatozoa contain organisms, which on their death, the saprophytes become intracellular in the absence of nutrients
 ant:kashtha kii koshikaon main jeevadravya kii jagah vaayu, tannic gond evam rezin sareekhe kuch apachya padaarth aa jate hai
 The amount of water in the inner lobe decreases and its water circulating fibers are coated with fine bags and gum particles
 isliye kisi ek hi vriksh ke ant:kashtha kii apeksha uske raskashtha main kashthapratirakshi padaarth adhik saralata se pravisht ho sakate hai
 The age of change from rasakastha to inner wood varies from tree to tree
 atev kisi kisi vriksh main imarti lakdi apekshaakrit jaldi taiyaar ho jaati he or raskashtha usamen anupaatat: kam hota he
 In the absence of juices within the wood, the seasonal effect on it is minimal
 lakdi ko apane aap, prakritik dhang se, sookhne main adhik samay lagata he
 Hence artificial treatment is done for this, which is called baking
 bhaleebhanti pakaai hui lakdi anek dosha se mukt ho jaati he
 The fibers without knot and other structural elements are often parallel to the length of the stem, or branch

 Wood can only take a certain amount of water, which is about 30 percent of its dry weight
 aabnoos jaisi lakdi nitant sukhi or bhalee bhanti upachaarit hone par bhi pani main dub jaati he, jabaki bols lakadiyaan cark se bhi halaki hoti he
 Like gum, or glue, the wood also reduces hardness, strength and firmness when wet and increases its ductility and expandability until it is saturated with moisture
 isliye geeli bhaap ke upachaar ke dwaara yah saralata purvak modi ja sakati he; or is prakaar furniture aadi banane ke kaam aati he
 Even when the moisture content is the same, the amount of change in the volume of the wood varies
 baari, yaa arezini lakadiyaan praaia: halaki hoti hai, yaa rezini lakadiyon kii apeksha adhik phoolati, yaa sikudti hai
 Therefore, soft wood has less change than hard wood, but not in proportion to density
 reshe kii disha main lakdi bahut kam ghatati, yaa badhati he
 Even well-made wooden scales and yards are reliable
 kintu reshon kii aadi disha main prasar yaa sankoch apekshaakrit bahut adhik, aravat lagbhag 30 se 50 gune tak or sparsh rekhiy lagbhag 60 se 100 gune tak, hota he
 For this reason, when a piece of wood, a string, or a board, etc

 Fallow wood, the simplest example of which is tinted wood, is made by gluing three layers together in such a way that the fibers of one stick to the fibers of another
 ye paraten anthti kam hai, sikudti baraabar he or vibhinn dishaao main inaki samarthy ek si rahati he
 The color of wood is often white, which becomes darker and becomes darker by becoming intertwined

 In order to withstand the natural forces, it is necessary to have such strength in the wood of the tree that it cannot break, or due to pressure, stretch, dampness and cramps etc
, it does not get permanent deformity
 isamen in sab prakaar ke pratibal aksmaat aa jane se utpann aghat sahan karne kii bhi shakti honi chahie
 The stem should stand upright like a pillar, so the wood must have enough firmness and be flexible enough that it will regain its position when the distorting cables are removed
 ye hi sab gun imarti lakdi main hote hai
 The composition of wood is something else parallel to the fibers and something else in the cross
 isi ke anuroop in donon dishaao main uski samarthy or dridhtaa bhi bhinn-bhinn hoti he
 The strength of pressure and tension is maximum parallel to the fibers and shearing strength in its horizontal direction

 lakdi kaa sabase mahatvapurn gun he, samarthy or halakepan kaa samanvay
 The ratio of pressure strength and density is the highest in wood
 tanaav samarthy main yah ispaat kii apeksha kamjor hoti he
 Therefore, in place of timber, steel etc

 lakdi ke kuch dosha aise hote hai jinke kaaran isamen kamajori aati he
 The discussion of knots has come up
 inase samarthy ghat jaati he
 Their side effects are more under stress than pressure, shearing, or firmness
 kabhi kabhi gaanthen dhili pad jaati hai
 Such a knot comes out of the planks through holes
 lakdi main bhanti bhanti kii daraaren bhi hoti hai
 They greatly reduce the strength of wood
 lakdi prakritik utpaada he, isliye yah dosharahit nahin ho sakati
 Yes, the extent of these defects in timber is fixed, such as no larger knots are made with a particular size, the knots do not fall under the most stress area, the cracks do not fall into the area of maximum shearing, or the surface, etc

 vastav main, yahi kaaran tha jiske chalate in dinon purvi deshon ke saath pashchimi desh sambandh kaayam nahin kar sake
 Not only this, in the latter part of the fifteenth century their remaining merchant routes were also blocked
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki 1453 i
 main turk jati kaa ek mahaan vijeta muhamd dwitiya ne kustuntuniya par adhikaar kar liya or unke vyapaarik maarg ko band kar diya
 Nevertheless, these inconveniences also led to the struggle of Western travelers and businessmen and to some extent established relations with China
 mongol shaasha yuan jab tak jivit rahaa tab tak china se videshiyon kaa kuch-na-kuch sampark avashya kaayam rahaa
 But as soon as it died, it seemed that now their mutual relations would end
 lekin ming samraaton ne is sambandh ko purnjivit kiya or pashchimi deshon kii ore unmukh hue
 As time passed, the merchants of western countries could not forget the economic prosperity of the eastern countries
 marcopolo kii diary unke liye prerana-strot hi ban gayi thi faltah pandrahavin sadi ke ant or solahavin sadi ke armbh ke bich in yatriyon kii yatra punah hone lagi or unka vistaar bhi hone laga
 At this time, the Spanish, Dutch and Russian castes helped to advance relations towards the eastern and northern regions of Asia
 spain or portugal ne prerana paakar colombo naamak prasiddh yatri ne bhi yatra kii or sudur purv ke deshon main pahunchne kaa prayaas kiya
 The Portuguese arrived in Macao in 1511 AD and came directly to Chinese soil in 1514 AD

 They permanently resided in Macao
 china ke prasiddh bandargah canton ke nikat hi yah makaao avasthit he jahaan aajkal bhi acchhee sankhya main portugali nivas karte hai
 At this time the British also came to China

 He became the most influential in China and received the credit for opening the door of China to trade in Western countries
 in vibhinn jatiyon ke aagaman kaa kramik adhyayan karnaa aavashyak prathit hota he
 In East Asia, the caste that first arrived during the reign of the Ming dynasty was Portuguese
 1498 i
 main vascodigama ne africa ke samudr tateey kshetron kii yatra karte hue bharat-bhoomi par apane pairon ko rakhaa portugal yatri vascodigama ko is yatra se laabh hua ki pashchimi deshon ke logon, ko pradhantah tatkaal main portugijon ko, purvi deshon tak pahunchaane ke maarg kaa pataa lag gaya
 Therefore, his departure and expansion now started in other countries as well
 16 veen sadi ke prarambh main hi malakka par adhikaar karne ke samay ve china pahunch gayi
 He reached China in 1514 AD
 china aate hi ve vyapaarik kaaryon main sanlagn ho gayi
 Traders here started buying luxury items from China and selling them in Western countries where there was a demand for cosmetics
 lekin portuguese apane vyavhaar se chiniyon ko prasann nahin kar sake
 Their behavior and habits were not good, not only were the Portuguese bad, other castes also had similar habits
 spain ke log jab america pahunche tab vahaan kii moulik jatiyon kaa jivan bhi unke chalate atyant kshtprad ho gaya
 The people of Spain did not leave America even after being opposed and built settlements there and settled regularly
 niyamit rup se basate hi ve american logon ke dharm, samskruti rahan-sahan vagairah main hastkshep karne lage
 Not only this, along with the construction of settlements, he also oriented towards colonization; in this connection the Spaniards also reached China
 portugijon ke baad spanish hi china aaye
 The people of China were familiar with the kind of action this caste had done in America
 isliye china kii dharti par upnivesh-nirmaan kaa beej liye jaise hi is jati kaa aagaman hua, vaise hi chiniyon ne inkaa virodh karnaa prarambh kiya
 The Ming government even started a vigorous movement against this caste
 yahi kaaran hua ki america kii tarah china main spain waalon kii daal nahin gal saki
 They could neither maintain their existence in China nor could they build the desired settlements
 portugijon se bhi vyapaarik sambandh kaayam ho gayi the
 This relationship could not be established with them
 phir bhi spanish jidd ke pakke the
 The way they started living forcefully in America, they also tried to stay in China
 inkaa ek jattha china ke prasiddh bandargah canton main thahar gaya or china se vyapaarik sambandh kaayam karne kaa prayaas karne laga
 Finally, in the latter part of the eighteenth century, he succeeded in his work and started to build his settlement in Macao
 isi samay pashchim kii anek dharmik mishnariyaan bhi china aayin
 In China, these missionaries started propagating religion
 prarambh main in mishnariyon ke vyavhaar achche the, lekin baad main unki swarthpurna niti se china ke log parichit hue
 At the same time, the British and Dutch also arrived in China
 lekin yahan yah baat yaad rakhni chahie ki mingvansh ke shashan main china kaa pashchimi deshon se do prakaar ke sambandh kaayam hue-ek vyapaarik sambandh or doosraa dharmik sambandh
 The countries of the west traded the plots of the south with Macao and Canton
 pashchim ke vyapaaree china main apane deshon se anaaj sambandhi anek paudhe tathaa tambaaku laae
 These people promoted tobacco a lot
 inhen ke chalate china ke adhikansh log tambaaku kaa seven karne lage
 Similarly, his religious relationship with China was also maintained
 china ke bhitari ilaakon main pashchimi deshon kii mishnariyaan dharm-prachaar kaa kaary karti thi
 After the Mongols rule, Christians in China had come to an end and their influence began to decline
 lekin mingvansh ke shashan ke antim varshon main roman cathalikon ne in isaayiyon tathaa unki mishnariyon ko punarujjivit kiya
 At the same time, people from xxwrep 4 France, Agustinian, Jusite, Dominion, etc
 many religious sects reached China
 solahavin sadi ke praarambhik varshon main hi jesuit sampradaay kii pradhanta china main kaayam hone lagi
 The popular promotion of this community was Francis Xavier, who tirelessly and tirelessly tried to popularize this community in South and East Asia
 isi prachaarak ne na is sampradaay kaa prachaar china main bhi kiya
 In fact, the cult was able to survive in China only due to Xavier
 abhi jevisarya ko apane kaary main puri safalataa bhi nahin mili thi ki 1556 i

 After his death, the work of his work was carried by Methihar Rikki on his shoulders

 Rikki's genius was multi-faceted to increase the popularity of the Jesuit community
 vah jyotish tathaa ganit kaa prakand vidwaan tha
 Historians speculate that at present there was no such scholar of astrology and mathematics in China who could equal Rikki
 apane pratibha ke chalate hi usne china sahitya kaa bhi adhyayan kiya
 This was a completely new subject for Chinese literature Rikki, yet due to his studies and talent, he gained a lot of prestige among Chinese litterateurs
 apane dharm kaa adhyayan to use tha hi, usne canfusius ke dharm tathaa isai dharm kaa kaaphi gaharaa adhyayan kiya or donon dharmon kii samanta tathaa asamanta ko ek vidwaan ke rup main rakhane kaa prayaas kiya
 He made his residence in Peking, the capital of China
 isi samay philippine se spanian bhi china aayaa
 By now many Western castes had come into China
 1516 i
 main portuguese aa gayi the, 1575 i
 main spanish aa gayi the; dachon kaa aagaman 1604 i
 main hua tha or angrej 1637 i

 But by this time the Americans and Russians could not come
 ching shashan-kaal main inkaa aagaman bhi china main ho gaya
 The rule of the Ming dynasty came to an end in 1644 AD
 uttar main manchu naamak vijetaon ne ming ko parrast kiya
 Manchu was a resident of Manchuria
 sohalvin sadi ke uttararddh tathaa satrahavin sadi ke praarambhik varshon main unhone apane ko shaktishaalee bana liya or ming se mukden apahrit kar liya jo unki rajdhani bhi thi
 They also made Mukden their capital
 china main rahanevaale mongolon ne bhi ichha yaa anichhaa se manchuon ke shashan ko sweekaar kar liya
 The Manchus attempted to extend their state-limits to the southern wall of China
 isi samay jab china main ming ke viruddh asantosh kii bhaavana kaa janm hua tab mauka paakar manchuo ne peking par apana adhikaar kar liya or tabhi se ve china main shashan karne lage
 Kangxi and China Lung were the most powerful kings of this dynasty
 dirghakaal tak manchuo ne china par shashan kiya
 Westerners also came to China in Manchukaal
 agar sach poocha jaay to yah maananaa padegaa ki isi kaal main china main paashchaatya deshon ke prabhaav kii jad jamani prarambh hui or isi kaal main videshon se china kaa vaastavik sambandh kaayam hua
 During this period people from abroad came from both the place and both routes
 samudr ke raste se portuguese, spanish, french tathaa angrej or kuch italian tathaa german aaye
 At the same time, American traders also came to China in 1784 AD
 jameen ke maarg se keval rus ke log aaye jo china main chaandi kaa vyapaar karne lage
 Also signed a treaty with foreign states in China at this time
 is sandhi ke dwaara rus ko peking main ek mishan bhejne kaa adhikaar mila
 Russian missionaries also started working in Peking
 america or rus se yah sambandh china ke liye mahatvapurn siddh hua
 Foreign missionaries also arrived in China at this time
 atharahavin sadi ke china main is samay punah videshi mishnariyon kaa bhi aagaman hua
 By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the number of Christians in China had grown to 300,000
 1793 i
 main sarvapratham angrejon kaa ek mishan china aayaa
 The mission came to China under mccartney's leadership
 doosraa mishan 1816 i
 main peking aayaa
 It was led by Lord Amherst
 isi samay rabart morishan ke adheen bhi ek mishan china pahunchaa
 Taking advantage of this opportunity, now the Protestant missionaries started their work in China
 protestent log chiniyon ko hey drushti se dekhte the or unhen asabhy samajhate the
 Dutch missionaries also visited China and their first mission reached China in 1795 AD
 isi prakaar 1806 i
 main rus kaa ek doot aayaa
 But China did not show any sympathy towards him
 peking main france ke jemuit bhi pahunche or manchu samraat kii gaurav-gaatha gane lage
 Among the various missionaries, the most clever and influential British proved to be the missionaries of the British
 china main aayi vibhinn mishnariyon se agar angrej mishanri kii tulana kii jaay to yah spasht ho jaataa he ki atharahavin sadi ke ant or unnisvin sadi ke prarambh main hi angreji mishanri sabhi se aage nikal gayi
 The reason for this was that the British were very clever and hard-working
 apni vyapaarik kushalta tathaa raajnneeti chaturata ke chalate unhone anya mishnariyon ko pratiyogita main aage nahin badhane diya or bhavishya main china main ve apana prabhaav kaayam karne main samarth hue
 It is clear from the above description that the relationship between China and Western countries was established and by the nineteenth century, many foreigners and their missionaries had become visible all over China
 lekin vah sambandh shantipurvak aage na chal sakaa
 People's government of China gradually began to hate these foreigners and their missionaries
 unka vichaar tha, ki paashchaatya deshon se sampark badhaane par china kii sabhyataa tathaa samskruti nasht ho sakati he, isliye china ne paashchaatya pravritiyon kaa anubhav kiya or unase pruthak rahane kaa prayaas kiya
 Even after coming into contact with Western countries, he adopted his dress, religion and customs
 yahi kaaran tha ki manchu sarkaar khule rup se in paashchaatya deshon se pruthak rahane kaa prayaas karne lagi is baat ko drushti main rakhkar samraat kangehsee ne ek rajkeey vijyapti nikaali or china-pravesh se in jatiyon tathaa mishnariyon ko vanchit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 The emperor had his own sentiment behind this communique, but at the same time he had to remove this communion to satisfy the people of China
 china kii janata in videshiyon se ghrinaa karne lagi thi or yah sambhaavna kii jane lagi ki china main khun-kharabi bhi ho sakati he
 There was considerable dissatisfaction in China, especially from foreign missionaries
 ‘‘mishanri ke vibhinn adeshon ke bich jhagade, purvajon kaa aadar karte hue kuch dharm pravartit logon kaa samrat ke hukum kii manyata tathaa saath hi naye dharm kii pravriti ke prati unke afasaron ke pratinidhitiv ke dwaara unki satta kii nunata ne dhire-dhire bhraamak vichaaron ke prachaarak ke vaastavik charitra ke prati unki ankhen khol deen
 But it should be remembered that according to this release, foreigners who came to China were not evacuated from China
 keval un par yaa vibhinn deshon se aaye hue vyapaariyon par ek prakaar kaa niyantran rakhane kii baat kahi gayi
 The Manchu government of China had feared that if these merchants were not allowed to trade, they would try to spread unrest by spreading all over China
 isliye is vijyapti main yah spasht kar diya gaya ki ye videshi vyapaaree china ke sabhi tatavarti bandargahon se shantipurvak uchit vyapaar kar sakate hai
 The happiness of foreigners was not open as soon as they were allowed to do business, because they got this permission in a very easy manner
 isse unka utsaah or hausala donon badha
 As a result, due to lack of meaning, these people also started doing illegal business
 ve un vyapaarik suvidhaon kaa bhi durupyog karne lage jo unhen praapt hue the
 Naturally the attention of the Chinese government was again attracted to him
 isiilie manchu vansh ke duusare samrat chien lug ne 1757 i
 main ek duusari vijyapti nikaali jiske chalate vaideshik vyapaar ko china main simit kar diya gaya or vyapaariyon par anek prakaar ke pratibandh lagaaye gayi
 According to this release, these foreign traders were allowed to trade with only one port of southern China
 iske atirikt china main ek vyapaarik dal kaa sanghathan kiya gaya jise ‘ko-hang’ kaha gaya
 Foreign traders could trade with China only under the consultation and supervision of this team
 is tarah atharahavin sadi ke uttararddh main un vyapaariyon kii chaal par china kii sarkaar ne ek paini drushti rakhi or yah spasht kar diya ki ve vyapaarik maamalon ke liye kisi anya bandargah kaa daura nahin kar sakate hai
 But this release did not have any special effect on foreign traders
 vyapaar ke saath-saath china kii raajnneeti par bhi inkaa hastkshep hona prarambh ho gaya or isai mishnariyon ke kartrutv to or bhi adhik bure hone lage
 While doing business with Canton, he also started trading with other ports of China
 chiniyon ko opium kaa seven karakar unki aadaten buree banane lage
 Due to the habit of eating opium, traders wanted to get economic benefits by selling opium
 jab opium ke bure parinaamon ko china kii sarkaar dekhne lagi or is vyapaar par roak lagaayi, tab videshi vyapaaree china ke aphisaron ko ghoose dekar apni ore milaane lage or chori chhipe yah vyapaar chalata rahaa
 The British of England were very pathetic in this task
 opium ke chalate china ko do prakaar ke nuksaan hone prarambh ho gayi
 On one hand, the British benefited from increased opium sales, but China had to suffer economic losses
 doosraa yah ki china kii janata kaa naitik dharaatal neeche girane lage
 As a result, the government tried to control the opium trade with full rigor resulting in opium wars in China and Britain
 is yuddh main china safal nahin ho sakaa kyonki uske dushmano ke paas shaktishaalee or kendrit sarkaar thi or china kaa shashan kamjor tathaa vikendrit tha
 Therefore, the Chinese government was weak and decentralized to face these enemies
 atah in shatruon kaa saamana karne ke liye china katai taiyaar nahin tha
 '' is tarah anek varshon ke baad unnisvin sadi tak china ke saath videshiyon kaa sambandh kaayam hua
 The consequences of this relationship proved extremely bad for the Chinese

 Indian historian Mr
 Pannikar is of the view that China suffered more from the benefits of contact with Western countries and after five-six years of the First World War, the pride of China kept getting dusty, political integrity kept breaking and administrative persistence Could not be brought yuddh kala main madhya asian deshon se aage nikal jane ke kaaran china ne madhya asia par apana prabhutv jamaa liya, par saath hi saath vah europea shaktiyon ke samaksh kamjor padane laga

 vran yaa ulcer sharirprishth par sankraman dwaara utpann hota he
 The organisms of this infection destroy the endemic epithelium
 nasht hui upakalaa ke upar mrit koshikaaye evam pus sanchit ho jaataa he
 After the removal of dead cells and poo, granular tissue slowly comes in place of the destroyed epithelium
 is prakaar kii vikshati ko vran kehete hai
 In other words, the cellular death of epithelial tissue after infection is called ulceration
 kisi bhi prishth ke upar, athwa parshv main, yadi koi shodhyukt parigalit bhaag ho gaya he, to vahaan vran utpann ho jayega
 An ulcer that is fast filled is called a mild ulcer
 kabhi-kabhi koi vran sheeghra nahin bharta
 The reason for this ulcer becomes refractory is that it is either caused by infection by bacteria, or blood circulation in the ulcer does not occur properly
 vran, prishth par kii ek koshika ke baad duusari koshika ke nasht hone par, banataa he
 The following are three places where ulcers usually occur: mukh, amashay athwa antra - inamen vikruti dwaara utpann shothyukt parigalan hota he Low-branch elements - These cause inflammation due to lack of proper circulation of blood in old age, which causes necrosis
 garbhashay-greeva The life of Vran is divided into the following three phases: - vistaar, parivart tathaa sudhaar In the phase of expansion, the floor of the ulcer is covered with secretions and grime
 vran ke parisar teevr hote hai tathaa isamen se pusmukt srav nikalnaa rahata he
 In the phase of change, the filling of the ulcer starts
 iske tal kaa bhaag saaf hone lagata he
 Granular tissues begin to form in the floor and due to joining together, the entire surface gets covered
 sudhaar kii pravastha main kanikamay reshedaar tantu utak main, parivartit ho jate hai
 The formation of granular tissues is also not appropriate
 yadi kisi vran main kanikamay utak adhik ban gaye hon, to unako khurch dena chahie athwa silver nitrate jaise kisi costic padaarth se jala dena chahie
 There are three types of ulcers: vishishti, vishistataahin tathaa durdamy 
 The cause of this is infection of injury
 yah kshat abhighaat, athwa kinhin uttejk padaarthon, ke kaaran ho jaataa he
 Spontaneous occlusion, as in dentition, or blood-circulation-obstruction, as in inflamed veins, is the primary reason for its production
 poshanj vran vahika prerak niyantran ke anauchity se sambandhit he
 In an unhealthy state, it hinders the filling of the ulcer
 ye kuch vishisht rogon ke sookshm jeevon ke sankraman ke kaaran utpann hote hai
 These diseases are: tuberculosis, syphilis etc
 in vranon kii chikitsa karte samay sthanik chikitsa ke atirikt vishisht rog kii chikitsa bhi kerani hoti he
 It does not occur as a result of inflammatory reaction of an infection, but due to the destruction of tissues by refractory tumors
 iske dwaara utpann vran ke parisar arbud main hi villin ho jate hai
 This ulcer grows very quickly
 durdamy arbud hai : The vitality of the tissues deteriorates, as a result of which the infection continues to have its effect
 yahi kaaran he ki vran ke ropan main adhik samay lag jaataa he nimna avasthaa main vran ke sheeghra nahin bharte : Nerve damage, sphit shiraaon ke kaaran rudhir sankulata evam kuposhan tathaa Excess of culture medium present in the tissues, ie, diabetes sugar etc

 On the basis of this belief, Bell, with the help of his assistant Tomas Watson, started an effort to invent the telephone method and finally on March 10, 1876, he was able to make such an instrument that he sent a message to Watson
 Sent - Mr
 Watson, come here

 Around the same time, some other people in the United States were experimenting with the transmission of eloquence by Vidyudhi and Prof
 a scientist named Elisha Gray applied only to patent one of his instruments, just three hours after Bell was granted an application to patent his instrument
