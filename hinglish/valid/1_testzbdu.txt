 Renowned American scholar Dean Rasko Pound has called the school of 'social engineering'
 is vichaardhaara ke anusaar vidhishastra ke antargat mukhyatah do baton kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he- The adoption of a sociological approach to jurisprudence resulted in the emergence of realistic ideology in America under which the functional aspect of the law was given so much importance that it undermined the importance of abstract rules of codes and enactments and the principles embedded in them

 Realism, liberalism and constructivism are the three most popular theories in international relations
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhant mukhyat: do siddhanton main vibhajit kiye ja sakate hai, "pratyakshvaadi / buddhivaadee" jo mukhyat: rajya str ke vishleshan par dhyaan kendrit karte hai

 However, the most prevalent among schools of positivist theories are realism and liberalism
 yadhyapi, rachnawad antarrashtriya sambandhon main teji se mukhyadhara hota ja rahaa he
 The study of international relations was recognized as a theory by E
 H
 Carr's book "the Twenty Years' Crisis" and Hans Morgenthau's book Politics Between Nations

 In the early war years the theme of international relations focused on the balance of power, gradually it was replaced with a system of collective security
 in vichaarkon ko baad main "adarshavaadi" ke rup main pahachaanaa gaya
 The leading critic of the idealist school was the "realist" analyst E
 H
 Carr
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhant main vyaakhyaatmak or rachanaatmak drushtikonon main bhed tab najar aata he jab ham antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhanton ko vargeekrut karte hai
 Interpretive theories are those that approach the outside world theoretically for theory formation
 rachanaatmak siddhant ve hai jo maanate hai ki siddhant vastav main duniya kaa nirmaan karne main madad karte hai
 Realism or political realism has been the dominant theory of international relations since the inception of the teaching of international relations
 yah siddhant un pracheen paramparaagat drushtikonon par bharosa karne kaa daawa karata he, jisamen thuseedide, maikiyaveli or hobs jaise lekhak shaamil hai
 Early realism can be expressed as a reaction against idealistic thinking
 yathartwaadiyon ne dwitiya vishwa yuddh ke prakope ko adarshavaadi soch kii kami ke ek saboot ke rup main dekha tha
 There are various varieties in modern realist thought, however, as the main principles of this theory state control, existence and self-help are considered
 yatharthwaad main kai mahatvapurn manyataayen hai
 Realists believe that nation-states are unitary and geographically based actors in this chaotic international system, where no real official world exists as a government capable of regulating interactions or interactions between these nation-states
 duusare, yah antarsarkari sanghathanon, antarrashtriya sanghathanon, gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon, yaa bahurashtriya companiyon ke bajaay samprabhu rajyon ko hi antarrashtriya maamalon main praathmik abhinayta maanate hai
 Thus, the state itself, as the supreme system, remains in competition with each other
 aise main, ek rajya apane astitv ko banaae rakhane, apni khud kii suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye or in praathmik uddeshyon ke saath apane swayan ke swaarth kii khoj main ek tarksangat swytt abhinayta ke rup main kaary karata he or is tarah apni samprabhutaa or astitv kii raksha karne kaa prayaas karata he
 Realists believe that nation states, in pursuit of their own interests, attempt to mobilize resources for themselves and determine the relations between states by their respective levels of power
 shakti kaa yah str rajya ke sainya, aarthik or raajnneetik kshamtaaon se nirdhaarit hota he
 Human nature realists believe that states are inherently aggressive, so territorial expansion has been bounded by opposing powers
 jabaki dusre aakraamak / rakshaatmak yathartwaadeeyon kaa maananaa he ki rajya hamensha apane astitv kii suraksha or nirantarata kii chintaa se grast rahete hai
 The defensive approach leads to a security dilemma, because while a nation becomes a weapon to enhance its own security, the opponent also tries to gain parallel benefits as well
 isliye yah prakriya or adhik asthirataa kii ore le ja sakati he yahan suraksha ko keval shunya raashi khel / shunya-sanchay khel ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jahaan keval saapeksh laabh mil saktaa he
 Neo-realism or structural realism was presented by Kenneth Waltz in his book The Theory of International Politics as an advanced development of realism itself
 joseph greeko ne navayathartwaadee vichaaron ko or adhik paramparaagat yathartwaadiyon ke saath joda he
 This type of theory is sometimes called "modern realism"
 waltz ke nav yatharthwaad kaa kahana he ki sanrachana ke prabhaav ko rajya ke vyavhaar ko samajhane ke rup main liya janaa chahie
 Structure is defined in two forms, first — the system theory of the international system, which is chaotic and second — the distribution of capacities in units
 waltz bhi paaramparik yatharthwaad ko chunauti detaa he jo kii paaramparik sainya shakti par jor detaa he bajaay rajya kii sanyukt kshamtaaon ke, jo kii pradarshnatmak shakti ke rup main hoti hai
 "idealism" was the precursor to liberal theories of international relations
 adarshavaad jo khud ko yathartwaadiyon kii aalochana ke rup main dekhtaa tha
 In international relations, idealism is an ideological approach that recognizes that a state should adopt it in its internal political philosophy to set its foreign policy goal
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek adarshavaadi yah vishwaas kar saktaa he ki ghar par garibi samaapt karne ke saath-saath videshon main bhi garibi se nipatane ke liye saath milakar kaam kiya janaa chahie
 Wilson's idealism was intended as a precursor to the principles of liberal international relations, which arose among the "'institution makers'" after World War II
 udaarvaad yah maanata he ki rajya kii kshamtaaon ke bajaay rajya kii praathamikataayen, rajya ke vyavhaar ke liye mukhya nirdharak hoti hai
 Unlike realism, where the state is seen as a unitary actor, liberalism allows for plurality in state functions
 is prakaar, praathamikataayen alag alag rajyon main unki samskruti, aarthik pranali yaa sarkaar ke prakaar ke rup main alag alag karkon par nirbhar karengi
 Liberals also believe that contact between states is not limited only to political or security matters, while there is also contact between them for economic or cultural matters, whether through commercial companies, organizations or individuals
 Ho
 is prakaar, ek arajak antarrashtriya pranali ke baavjood, sahyog or satta ke vyapak vichaar ke liye bahut se avasar vidyaman hai, jaise ki saanskrithik puunji
 Another belief is that absolute or relative benefit can only be achieved through cooperation and mutual dependence, and in this way peace can be achieved
 loktantric shanti siddhant kaa tark he ki udaar loktantric rajyon ke bich lagbhag kabhi bhi yuddh nahin hua he or aapas main sangharsh athwa vivaad bhi bahut kam hi hue hai
 This theory is particularly seen as a contradiction to realist theories and this empirical claim has now become a great controversy in the field of political science
 loktantric shanti ke liye kai spashtikaran aaye hai
 It is also argued in the book Never at War, that democratic states in general have behaved very differently in terms of diplomacy than non-democratic states
 yathartwaadee udaaravaadeeyon ke is siddhant main asahmati prakat karte hai, ki unhone aksar shanti ke liye sanrachanaatmak kaarnon kaa hawala dete hue, rajya sarkaar kaa virodh kiya he
 Sebastian Rosto, a critic of democratic peace theory, has pointed to America's behavior toward leftist-leaning democratic countries in Latin America during the Cold War to challenge democratic peace
 ek tark yah bhi he ki vyapaar bhagidaaron ke bich aarthik nirbharta yuddh hone kii sambhaavna ko kam karti he
 Realists, by contrast, claim that economic dependence increases the likelihood of conflict rather than reducing it
 nav udaarvaad, udaar sansthawad yaa nav - udaaravaadi sansthawad udaar soch ke liye ek pragati he
 It argues that international institutions may allow nation-states to successfully cooperate in the international system
 uttar- udaaravaadi siddhant kaa tark he ki aadhunik or bhumandalikrut duniya ke bheetar rajya apni suraksha or samprabhu hiton ko sunishchit karne ke liye vastav main sahyog ke liye kadam badha rahe hai
 This theory is particularly engaged in re-interpreting the concepts of sovereignty and autonomy
 swaittata aazaadee kii avadharana, aatmanirnay, ek purna jimmedaar agency or kartavyaparayanata kii dharna se dur sthanantarit hone se ek samasyagrast avadharana ban jaati he
 The important thing is that autonomy is in the form of capacity for good governance
 isi prakaar se, samprabhutaa bhi kartavya ke liye sahi se badlaav kaa anubhav karaati he
 Constructivism or social constructivism is described as a challenge in the face of the dominance of the principles of neo-liberal and neo-realist international relations
 maaikel barnet varnan karte hai kii rachnawadi antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhanton ko is rup main samajha jaataa he kii vichaar kaise antarrashtriya sanrachana ko paribhaashit karte hai, yah sanrachana kaise rajyon ke hiton or pahchaan ko paribhaashit karti he or rajya or gaiyr rajya abhinayta is sanrachana ko kaise pun: pesh karte hai
 The major theories of constructivism hold that "international politics is produced by persuasive ideas, collective values, culture, and social identity
 " rachnawad kaa tark he ki antarrashtriya vaastaviktaa saamaajik rup se gyanatmak / boudhik sanrachanaon ke dwaara nirmit hoti he
 This theory emerged as a debate taking into account the scientific method of theories of international relations and the role of theories in the production of international power
 amenul edler ne kaha he ki rachnawad tarkwaadi or vyaakhyaatmak antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhanton main ek bich kaa rasta he
 Marxism and neo-marxism are structuralist norms of the principles of international relations, which reject the view of state struggle or cooperation of realists and liberals and instead focus on economic and material aspects
 antarrashtriya sambandhon main nariwadi drushtikon 1990 ke dashak main lokapriy bana
 This approach emphasizes that women's experiences are constantly being excluded from the study of international relations
 antarrashtriya sambandhon main nariwadiyon kaa tark he ki ling sambandh antarrashtriya sambandhon ke abhinn ang hai
 Therefore, attention should also be paid to diplomatic women and marital relations which play a role in facilitating the illegal trade in sex
 harith siddhant antarrashtriya sambandhon ke siddhanton kaa ek up kshetra he jo antarrashtriya paryaavaran sahyog se sambandhit he
 For more information: Fundamentalism in the principles of international relations, anti-fundamentalism, positivism in the principles of international relations, post-positivism in the principles of international relations, post-realism and premodernism prakaaryawad antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa ek siddhant he jo ki europea ekikaran ke anubhav se ubhar kar saamne aayaa
 While realists see self interest as a motivating factor, functionalists focus on shared interests by states
 antarrashtriya sambandhon main rajya cartil siddhant arthshaastra ke pracheen sansthagat siddhant siddhant se aayaa he
 This theory has a German background, as Germany was previously the highest developed economic cartels and the homeland of classical cartel theory
 antarrashtriya sambandhon ke anya siddhanton ke ke bich, rajya cartil siddhant antarrashtriya sambandhon main prakaaryawad ke saath adhik judaa hua he
 Shortly after inception, the state cartel theory has focused its attention on the theory of international organizations
 uttar - sanrachnawad antarrashtriya raajnneeti main duusare adhikansh drushtikonon se alag he, kyonki yah khud ko ek aise siddhant, skool yaa pratimaan ke rup main nahin dekhtaa he jo kii keval kisi ek hi vishay ke bare main lekha-jokha rakhata ho
 Instead, the post-structuralist approach is an ethos, method and approach that examines and explores critiques in a particular way
 uttar -sanrachnawad aalochana ko ek swaabhaavik sakaaratmak tareeke se dekhte he jo ki vikalpon kii khoj ke liye aisi sthitiyaan banataa he
 Post-colonialism holds a critical theory and approach to international relations in the teaching of international relations and is not considered a mainstream area in the teaching of international relations

 a total of two types of religions were born
 pehla abrahamik ev doosraa hindu
 Under the Abrahamic religion, basically three religions are Jewish, Christian and Muslim
 teenon ke dharmik siddhanton main lambe samay tak ek bhai chaare kii si sthiti rahi thi
 Although the Crusade and Jihad have been going on since Islam was established
 teenon dharm ke anuyaayiyon ne talwaar kii dhar par vistaarwaad kaa anwarat prayaas kiya he
 The emergence of violence has also been the result of geographical situations
 marusthal kabhi behad thande or kabhi kabhi behad garm
 The birth of violent spirit in extreme weather nature is a natural process
 vishwa main in sabase bhinn ek or bhi mukhya dharm he vah he hindu dharm
 The birthplace of this religion has been the year of India
 pehle teenon dharmon main ek jo mukhya samyata he, vah he akeshwarwad kii
 At the same time Hinduism is a religion that believes in diversity
 hindu dharm ke antargat to tat tvam asi ko udghosh ke saath hi har vyakti ishvar yaa ishvar kii pratimurti he
 It is a process of multiplying from one
 hamen in dharmon kii tulana karne hetu inaki prishthbhumi khangaalane kii aavashyaktaa
 The three religions of the Abrahamic family are religions born in the desert and Hinduism is basically a religion born on the banks of the river
 marusthal main vividhta nahin hoti he
 The only sandy earth spread all around is visible
 aise main ek hi aseem shakti kaa anubhav ek sahaj manobhaav he
 Man's consciousness of God is ordinarily through nature
 jab prakruti main koi vividhta nahin dikhaayi degi tab vahaan se sanskaar or sanskaron se niklaa hua dharm bhi vividhta viheen hi hoga
 The three Abrahamic religions originated in the desert
 to marusthal kii bhaanti MONOTONY yaa ekresata he va marusthal kii tarah hi aparivartansheel bhi he
 There are many similarities among the three religions
 yatha ek ishvar
 An almighty God who governs the creatures of the world and punishes them for their sins
 yani ishvar kaa shashan bhay kii satta par tikaa hua he
 Surprisingly, there is no word for any language "virtue" in the languages associated with these three religions
 sirf paap ke liye shabd he
 That is, there is an attempt to establish God completely through fear
 ishvar kisi unchen sthaan par baith sabake paapon kii ginati kar qayaamat kaa intjaar karata he
 In Hinduism, like the flow of a river, a waiting change is novelty
 isi kaaran se indradhanushi vividhta bhi he
 There is a Prophet in the Abrahamic religions through which God commands the people of TEN COMMANDMENTS
 evam unki avhelnaa karne par sajaa dene kaa praavdhaan he
 It is a process of descending of divinity
 upar se neeche aane kii prakriya he
 In Hinduism, ego is the epitome of Brahmasmi
 yani arohan kii prakriya he
 Man is the process of attaining Brahmanism through his own practices
 yahaan bhay nahi utsaah kaa upadan he
 The Battle of Plassey took place on 23 June 1757 in a place called 'plassey' on the banks of the Ganges river in Nadia district, 22 miles south of Murshidabad
 is yuddh main ek ore british east india company kii sena thi to duusari ore thi bengal ke nawab kii sena
 The Nawab Siraj-ud-daulah was defeated by the Company's army under the leadership of Robert Clive
 kintu is yuddh ko company kii jeet nahi maan sakate kayonki yuddh se purv hi nawab ke teen senanayake, uske darbari, tathaa rajya ke amir seth jagat seth aadi se kalive ne shadanyatra kar liya tha
 The Nawab's entire army had not even participated in the war, immediately after the war, Nawab was killed by Mir Jaffer's son Meeran
 yuddh ko bharat ke liye bahut durbhagyapurna mana jaataa he is yuddh se hi bharat kii daastaa kii kahani shuru hoti he
 The company benefited a lot from this war, it came for business but became a king
 is yuddh se praapt sansadhano kaa prayog kar company ne france kii company ko karnataka ke tisare or antim yuddh me nirnaayak rup se haraa diya tha
 After this war, the company was defeated by the Company in the Battle of Bedra
 is yuddh kii jaankaree landan ke india house librari main uplabdh he jo bahut badi librari he or vahaan bharat kii gulaami ke samay ke 20 hazaar dastavej uplabdh he
 According to the documents available there, the British had only 300 soldiers at the time of Plassey's war and Siraj-daulah had 18 thousand soldiers
 angreji sena kaa senapati tha robert clive or sirajudaula kaa senapati tha mirajafar
 Robert Clive knew that if there was a face-to-face war, it would not take even an hour and we would lose the war, and Clive wrote this to the British Parliament several times
 in dastavejon main clive kii do chithiyaan bhi hai
 In which he has prayed that if Plassey wants to win the war, then more soldiers should be given to me
 uske jawaab main british parliament ke taraf se ye chitthee bheji gayi thi kii ham abhi nepolian bonapart ke khilaaf yuddh lard rahe hai or plasi se zyada mahatvapurn hamaare liye ye yuddh he or is se zyada sipaahi ham tumhe nahin de sakate
 Robert Clive then hired two of his spies and asked them to find out if there was a man in siraj-daula's army who we could bribe and betray our country in the greed of bribe
 uske jasuson ne ye pataa laga ke bataaya kii haan uski sena main ek aadmi aisa he jo rishwat ke naam par bengal ko bech saktaa he or agar aap use kursi kaa laalach de to wo bengal ke saat pushton ko bhi bech saktaa he
 And that man was Mirzafar and Mirzafar was such a man who had the same dream day and night when he would become the Nawab of Bengal
 ye baaten robert clive ko pataa chali to usne mirajafar ko ek patr likhaa
 The company then gave power to puppet Nawab Mir Jafar, but no one knew that the power was with the company
 nawab ke darbari tak use clive kaa gadhaa kehete the company ke afasaron ne jam kar rishwat batori bengal kaa vyapaar bilkul tabah ho gaya tha iske alaava bengal me bilkul araajaktaa fail gai thi
 Causes and Consequences of the Plassey War ' aadhunik bharat ke itihaas main plasi yuddh kaa atyant mahatv he
 Through this war, the East India Company defeated the Nawab of Bengal siraj-ud-daula and laid the foundation of the British Empire in Bengal
 is liye is yuddh ko bharat ke nirnaayak yudhon main vishisht sthaan uplabdh he
 Bengal was an integral part of the Mughal Empire
 parantu aurangzeb kii mrityu ke baad iske antargat vibhinn praanton main apni swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa kar di
 In which Alwardi Khan took control of Bengal
 unhen koi putr nahin tha
 Had only three daughters
 badi ladki chhasiti begum ni:santaan thi
 There were one son each from the second and third
 jiskaa naam shaukatganj, or sirajuddaula tha
 He loved Siraj-ud-daula more
 isliye apane jivan kaal main hi usne apana uttaradhikari ghoshit kar diya tha
 Alvardi died on 10 April 1756
 or sirajuddaula bengal kaa nawab bana parantu shuru se hi east india company ke saath uskaa sangharsh avashyabhavi ho gaya
 Finally on 23 June 1757 a war broke out between the two known as the Plassey War
 is yuddh ke anek kaaran the jo is prakaar he
 Internal conflict- gaddi par baithte hi sirajuddaula ko shaukatganj ke sangharsh kaa saamana karnaa padaa kyonki shaukatganj nawab bananaa chahta tha
 In this, he had the support of Chhati Begum and his Divan Rajavallavas and the Mughal Emperor, so Siraj-ud-daulah first tried to resolve that internal conflict
 kyonki isi ke chalate bengal kii raajnneeti main angrejon kaa hastkshep badhata ja rahaa tha nawab ne shaukatganj kii hatya kar di
 And after that he decided to compete with the British
 angrej dwaara nawab ke viruddh shadyantra- From the very beginning, the British were eyeing Bengal
 kyonki bengal ek upjau or dhani praant tha
 Had Bengal been the company's authority, it hoped to earn more and more money
 itnaa hi nahin ve hindu vyapaariyon ko apni ore milakar unhen nawab ke viruddh bhadakaana shuru kiya nawab ise pasand nahin karata tha
 Use of business facilities - mughal samraat ke dwaara angrejon ko nishulk saamudrik vyapaar karne kii chhot mili thi lekin angrejon ne iskaa durupyog karnaa shuru kiya
 They also started doing their personal business free of charge and encouraged the native traders to do business without paying tax
 isse nawab ko aarthik kshati pahunchati thi
 The Nawab did not like them when, when he decided to stop the misuse of business facilities, the British came out on the struggle
 angrejon dwaara kile bandi- At this time there was a possibility of a seven-year war in Europe
 jisamen england or france ek duusare ke viruddh ladane vaale the at: duusare desh main bhi jo angrej or francisi the
 He feared war
 isliye apni- 2 sthiti ko majboot karne ke liye unhonen kilebandi karnaa shuru kiya
 The Nawab could not destroy it
 angrej dwaara sirajuddaula ko nawab kii manyata nahin dena- According to the ancient tradition of Bengal, if a new Nawab sat on the throne, then on that day there was a court
 or uske adheen nivas karne vaale raajaaon, amiron yaa videshi jatiyon ke pratinidhiyon ko darbar main upasthit ho kar uphaar bhet karnaa padataa tha
 That they accept the new Nawab
 parantu sirajuddaula ke rajyabhishek ke avasar par angrejon kaa koi pratinidhi darbar main hajir nahin hua
 Because they did not consider Siraj-ud-daulah as Nawab, due to this, the possibility of conflict between the two increased
 nawab badalane kii koshish- The British wanted to replace siraj-ud-daulah and make someone who was ready to follow his instructions, the British started trying to do this
 aisi paristhiti main sangharsh taala nahin ja saktaa tha
 Invasion of Calcutta jab nawab ne kile bandi karne ko rokane kaa aadesh jari kiya to angrejon ne usapar koi dhyaan nahin diya wo kile kaa nirmaan karte rahe
 The Nawab became angry on this and attacked Kothi of Kasimbazar on 4 June 1756
 angrej sainik is akraman se ghabadaa gaye or angrejon kii paraajay hui or kasim bazaar par nawab kaa adhikaar ho gaya
 After this, the Nawab attacked Fort William of Calcutta very soon, even the British soldiers could not get the teak in front of the Nawab and the Nawab also got the right
 is yuddh main kaaphi angrej sainik giraftaar kiye gayi
 Black closet accident uparyukt ladaai main nawab ne 146 angrej sainikon ko kaid kar liya to use ek choti si andheri kothri main band kar diya isaki lambaai 18 feet or chaudaai 14- 10 feet thi
 It was built by the British and Indian criminals were stopped in it
 chunki garmi kaa din tha or yuddh ke parim the 123 sainikon kii mrityu dam ghutane ke kaaran ho gai or 23 sainik bache jisamen hanwel ek angrej sainik bhi tha
 He informed about this incident to the British of Madras
 isi durghatana ko kaali kothri kii durghatana ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Due to this the anger of the British erupted and they started preparing for war with the Nawab
 angrejon dwaara kalakatta par pun: adhikaar- To avenge his defeat, the British soon attacked Calcutta
 is samay nawab ne manikchand ko kalakatta kaa raja niyukt kiya tha
 But he was a friend and well wisher of the British
 falat: angrejon kii vijay hui kalakatta nawab ke changul se mukt ho gaya
 The Treaty of Ali Nagar was signed between the two on 9 February 1757 and the British again got all kinds of practical rights
 francisiyon par angrejon kaa akraman- The British attacked Chand Nagar, the town of the French
 or use apane adhin kar liya
 The French were friends of the Nawab, so the Nawab was very upset with this incident
 mirajafar ke saath gupt sandhi – At the same time, the British hatched a conspiracy to depose the Nawab
 isamen nawab ke bhi kai log shaamil the
 Such as Raidullabh chief commander Mirzafar and rich businessman Jagat Sevak etc
 angrejon ne mirajafar ko bengal kaa nawab banane kaa pralobhan diya or iske saath gupt sandhi kii is sandhi ke pashchaat nawab par yah aarope lagaaya gaya ki unhone ali nagar kii sandhi kaa ulanghan kiya he or usee kaa bahaanaa banaakar angrej ne nawab par 22 june 1757 ko akraman kar diya
 a fierce battle ensued in the battle of Plassey, Mirzafar had already signed a treaty with the British, which resulted in a tremendous defeat of the Nawab
 angrejon kii vijay hui
 The Nawab was assassinated and Mirzafar was made the Nawab of Bengal
 plasi yuddh ke parinaam- The foundation of the British Empire was laid in Bengal by the Battle of Plassey
 angrejon ko nawab banaaya gaya
 The Battle of Plassey was not really a war; it was a conspiracy and a display of treachery
 According to the famous historian 'panivkar', Plassey's war was not, but the result was quite significant
 isliye ise vishwa ke nirnaayak yudhon main sthaan uplabdh he
 Because by this the foundation of British Empire was laid in Bengal
 clive ne is yuddh ko kranti kii sangya di he
 In fact it was a revolution because it brought a great change in the stream of Indian history and a business institution took the political reins of Bengal in its hands
 iske vibhinn tarah ke parinaam drushtigochar hote hai
 Political Results- iske raajnneetik parinaam bharat ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 This led to the incorporation of political rights in the hands of a business institution and the establishment of British power in India
 vastut: yah british raashtra ke liye atyadhik mahatv tha is yuddh ke pashchaat mirajafar ko bengal kaa nawab banaaya gaya
 But this was an inept person
 iske ayogyata kafaita uthaate hue bengal kaa vaastavik shaasha angrej ban gaye
 The influence of the British on Bengal increased and gradually the path of expansion of 2 British Empire was cleared
 sirajuddaula ke hatane se angrejon ko raajnneetik prabhutv badhaane kaa phayda mila
 The result of B
 Plassey proved fatal to the Mughal Empire, every year the Mughal ruler used to earn a good income from Bengal, but now this income is exhausted
 angrejon ko bhartiya nareshon ko kamajori kii jaankaree mil gai
 In the future, he took great advantage of it and paved the way for the conquest of northern India
 aarthik parinaam- The war brought considerable economic benefits to the British, Mirzafar gave Rs 1 crore 17 lakh to the company, which strengthened the economic condition of the company, due to the plunder of Bengal, it cost him a lot of money
 company ke math karmchaareeyon ko saadhe 12 lakh rupye mili
 Clive received two lakh 24 thousand rupees
 is yuddh ke pashchaat company dhire- 2 jagidaar baad main bengal kii dewan ban gai
 Thus it laid the foundation of British Empire in India
 angrejon ko pun: vyapaar karne kaa adhikaar mila mirajafar ne company ko ghus ke rup main 3 karod rupye pradaan kiye tathaa vyapaar se bhi angrejon ne 15 karod kaa munafa kamaaya
 By- mohammad shahid is ghatana se ek nai rajnatik shakti kaa udai hua
 The interests of the company got entwined with politics and it started gaining dominance
 mogul samrajya ke durbalata bhi saaf ho gai
 The company came to know the divisions, the character of the ruling class of India

 Earlier in Sanskrit literature there is a tradition of Nighantu, a compilation of difficult Vedic words and his commentary composed by Yask and other scholars in the seventh century BC
 is parampara ke tahat vibhinn vishyon ke nighantu taiyaar kiye gayi jinamein dhanvantari rachit ayurveda kaa nighantu bhi shaamil tha
 After this the emergence and development of Namamala dictionary in Sanskrit and Hindi is visible

 kosh rachana ke is parmparik bhartiya udhyam ke centre main shabd or shabd-rachana thi
 These lexicons that highlight the words, their various forms, their synonyms, their origins and development process, were helpful in the creation of knowledge, but they could not be placed in the category of knowledge

 He also wrote that the Knowledge Dictionary of Hindi is not a translation of Bangla, but was originally written in Hindi
 in koshon ke alaava hardev bahari rachit prasad sahitya kosh, premanarayan tandon krit 'hindi sevisansar' or gyanmandal dwaara prakashit sahityakosh ullekhneey he

 But he faced a lot of problems in raising funds and intellectual resources for thesis

 But the Bangla Encyclopedia edited by Nagendranath Vasu is the first modern encyclopaedia derived from Indian languages
 bharatvarsh main is shrenee kaa yah pahula gransh tha jo 27 varsh ke athak parishram se anek dhurandhar vidwaanon ke sahyog dwaara purnataa ko praapt hua
 It was published in 1911 in 22 volumes

 That is why, by appreciative patience, he immediately laid the foundation of the Hindi encyclopedia and completed it
 nagendranath vasu ne hi anek hindi vidwaanon ke sahyog se hindi vishwakosh kii rachana kii jo san 1916 se 1932 ke madhya 25 khandon main prakashit hua
 While this work was going on, at the same time, Dr

 PHD started the process of creating an encyclopaedia in Marathi language and usually completed it in twelve years with the help of 40 writers

 Thereafter, the enthusiasm to feed his knowledge collection in Marathi Paadisin Gujarati cover was also increased and started

 But at the same time, the same inspiration arose in his heart which arose in the minds of Bengali lighters on completing the Bengali encyclopedia
 isaliye unhone turant hi shuddh hindi vishwakosh ke rachana kaa prastaav kiya jo sweekrut samayik style ke anusaar ho or jiske bishay sarvyaapee rashtrabhasha ke yogya hon
 All of the newly invented innovations have been included and the essence of all the year-wise material collected by Marathi, Gujarati and Bengali writers along with research has become embedded in the Hindi dictionary

 For this an expert committee was formed and its first meeting was held on 11 February 1956 and the work of creation of Hindi encyclopedia started in January 1957

 has the following benefits: yogadarshan chah aastik darshanon main se prasiddh he
 The main goal of this philosophy is that man can achieve the ultimate goal
 anya darshanon kii bhaanti yogadarshan tatvamimasaa ke prashnon main na ulajhakar mukhyatah moksh vaale darshan kii prastuti karata he
 But every philosophy discussing salvation must have some elemental background
 atah is hetu yogadarshan, sankhyadarshan kaa sahaara letaa he or uske dwaara pratipaadit tatvamimasaa ko sweekaar kar letaa he
 That is why Yogadarshan has been associated with Sankhyadarshan since the beginning
 with the nature, nature of man
 iskaa prarambh patanjali muni ke yogasutron se hota he
 The best interpretation of the Yogasutras is found in the Vibhaष्यyaष्यa written by Vyāsa Muni
 isamen bataaya gaya he ki kis prakaar manushya apane man kii vrittiyon par niyantran rakhkar jivan main safal ho saktaa he or apane antim lakshya nirvana ko praapt kar saktaa he
 Yogadarshan is dualistic like Sankhya
 sankhya ke tatvamimasaa ko purna rup se sweekaarte hue usamen keval 'ishwar' ko jod detaa he
 That is why Yogadarshan is called 'sesvara Sankhya' and Sankhya is called '
 yogadarshan main purush tatv kendriya vishay ke rup main prastut hua he
 Although both men and nature have been considered as independent, but in a physical form, the power of man is supreme
 purush ke do bhed kahe gayi hai
 The man is said to be conscious and unconcerned, but due to ignorance, the man accuses himself in the root and result of the mind
 purush or chitt ke sanyukt ho jane par vivek jaataa rahata he or purush swayan ko chitt rup main anubhav karne lagata he
 This ignorance is the cause of all sorrows and tribulations of the man
 yoga darshan kaa uddeshy purush ko is dukh se, agyaan se, mukt karana he
 The same fact has been theoretically presented in yoga philosophy as hey, hey-hey, han and hanopay
 in chaar kramon main purush duhkhon se mukti paata he, isaliye yoga main ise 'chaturvuhwaad' kaha gaya he evam is chaturvyuuh se mukt hona hi yoga kaa param uddeshy he
 In the philosophy of Chaturvuhvad itself, the philosophy of male, male and male charitableness appears in Yoga philosophy
 purush avidyagrast hone par sansar-chakra main padataa he or purusharthshoonyata kii avasthaa ko praapt karata he
 The ultimate goal of a man is the attainment of Kaivalya
 yoga main purush ko aatma kaa paryaay mana gaya he
 Therefore, the soul, which is innumerable in number, can attain its Kaivalya only if the three forms of grief are resolved by making effort in the form of Chaturvedi
 dukh ke teen rup he - aadhyatmik, aadhibhautik or aadhidaivik
 Effortlessness is the stage above these triads
 purusharthshoonyata ke pashchaat hi purush kii apane swaroop kii sthiti hoti he
 In Yogadarshan, it is called Kaivalya or Moksha
 patanjali ko kapil dwaara bataaya gaya sankhyadarshan hi abhimath he
 In short, according to this philosophy there are innumerable men in this world and one predominant or original nature
 purush chit he, pradhan achit
 Man is eternal and unchanging, prime is also continual but changeable
 donon ek duusare se sadaa pruthak hai, parantu ek prakaar se ek kaa duusare par prabhaav padataa he
 Changes in nature begin with the relationship of man
 vah kshubdh ho uthati he
 First there is the origin of importance or intelligence, then of ego, then of mind
 ahankaar se gyanendriyon or karmedriyon tathaa paanch tanmatraaon arthath shabd, sparsh, rup, ras tathaa gandh kii, ant main in paanchon se akaash, vaayu, tej, ap or kshiti naam ke mahabhuton kii
 Due to all this, the game of this world is happening
 sankshep main, yahi sristi kaa kram he
 Even if there is a change in nature, it remains the same as men
 phir bhi ek baat hoti he
 Just as bringing colorful flowers in front of white crystals gives them a colorful reflection on them, similarly the male gets reflections of natural deformities
 kramash: vah buddhi se lekar kshiti tak se ranjit prathit hota he, apane ko prakruti ke in vikaron se sambhddha maanane lagata he
 Today, he considers himself rich, poor, strong, weak, family, happy, sad, etc
 apane shuddh rup se dur ja padaa he
 This is his illusion, avidya
 pradhan se bane hue in padaartho ne uske rup ko dhank rakhaa he, uske upar kai tah khol pad gai he
 If he throws away these shells, these coverings, he will get rid of them
 jis kram se bandhaa he, uske ulate kram se bandhan tootenge
 One has to rise above mahabhutas first
 ant main pradhan kii ore se munh pherana hoga
 This bond is not real, but seems to be very firm
 jis upyog se bandhanon ko todakar purush apane shuddh swaroop main sthit ho sake us upaay kaa naam yoga he
 The teacher of Sankhya says: Yadva tadva taduchhitti: Parampurushartha: - As far as possible, the removal of this artificial combination of male and head is the ultimate effort
 yoga kaa yahi darshanik dharaatal he: avidya ke dur hone par jo avasthaa hoti he uskaa varnan vibhinn aacharyon or vichaarkon ke vibhinn dhang se kiya he
 According to their respective views, they have also given him different names
 koi use kaivalya kahata he, koi moksh, koi nirvana
 After reaching up, the person who has the experience should say it as such
 vastut: vah avasthaa aisi he, yato vaacho nivartate aprapya mansa sah - jahaan man ore vaani kii pahunch nahin he
 It is necessary to discuss one more thing in a few words
 asankhya purushon ke saath patanjali ne 'purush vishesh' naam se ishwar kii satta ko bhi mana he
 The teacher of Sankhya does not believe so
 vastut: maanane kii aavashyaktaa bhi nahin he
 Even if he removes some formulas from Yogadarshana, then there is no difference
 yoga kii sadhana kii drushti se ishwar ko maanane, na maanane kaa vishesh mahatv nahin he
 Both believers and non-believers in the authority of God have equal rights in yoga
 vidya or avidya, bandhan or usase chhutkaaraa, sukh or du:kha sab chitt main hai
 Therefore, whoever is desirous of getting a position in his own form, he will have to try to remove his mind from those things, which pull the head towards the head and its disorders and create a feeling of happiness and sorrow
 is tarah chitt ko hataane tathaa chitt ke aisi vastuon se hat jane kaa naam vairaygy he
 This is the first step of yoga
 purna vairaygy ekadam nahin hua karata
 As soon as a person is engaged in the practice of yoga, as soon as quietness also increases and as soon as quietness increases, the trend in cultivation increases
 jesa patanjali ne kaha he: drusht or anushravik donon prakaar ke vishyon main virakti, gandhi ji ke shabdon main anasakti, honi chahie
 Heaven etc
, whose knowledge we get from the words and scriptures of the Mahatmas, is called Anuprivika
 yoga kii sadhana ko abhyaas kehete hai
 Here for many hundred years, the word Bhajan has also started in the sages in this beginning
 chitt jab tak indriyon ke vishyon kii ore badhata rahegaa, chanchal rahegaa
 The senses will keep him in contact with other food items one after the other
 kitnon se viyog bhi karaati rahengi
 There will be hundreds of opportunities for stimulating work, anger, greed, etc
 sukh du:kha kii nirantar anubhuti hoti rahegi
 In this way, the bond with the head and its disorders that have been going on for many births will continue to become stronger and stronger
 at: chitt ko indriyon ke vishyon se khinchakar antarmukh karnaa hoga
 Many remedies have been given for this, whose details need not go into details
 saadhaaran manushya ke chitt kii avasthaa kshipt kehalaati he
 He throws from one subject to another
 jab usko praytn karke kisi ek vishay par laayaa jaataa he tab bhi vah jaldi se vishyantar kii ore chalaa jaataa he
 This state is called deranged
 dirdh praytn ke baad sadhak use kisi ek vishay par der tak rakh saktaa he
 The name of this stage is concentrated
 chitt ko vasheebhoot karnaa bahut kathin kaam he
 Sri Krishna has described it as a strong balwat-like elephant
 chitt ko vash main karne main ek cheez se sahaayta milti he
 It is a matter of ordinary experience that as long as the body is fickle, the mind is fickle and the fickleness of the mind keeps the body fickle
 sharir kii chanchalta nadisanthaan kii chanchalta par nirbhar karti he
 As long as the radius of the pulse is weak, the senses on the body will be subject to acceptable subjects
 un aadhaaton kaa prabhaav mastishk par padegaa jiske falswaroop chitt or sharir donon main hi chanchalta bani rahegi
 To make the mind immobile, the yogi takes the same measures as is sometimes required in war
 kisi prabal shatru se ladane main yadi uske mitron ko parrast kiya ja sake to safalataa kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 In order to gain authority over the mind, the yogi tries to subdue the body and also the nadisastha, mainly in it
 sharir bhautik he, naadiyaan bhi bhautik hai
 That is why it is easy to deal with them
 jis prakriya se yah baat siddh hoti he uske do ang hai: asana or pranayam
 The body becomes immobile by posture
 bahut se asana kaa abhyaas to swasthya kii drushti se kiya jaataa he
 Patanjali has said this much: Steady Sukhmasanam: The posture on which one can sit for long periods without suffering is superior
 yahi sahi he ki asanasiddhi ke liye swasthya sambandhi kuch niyamon kaa paalan aavashyak he
 As Shri Krishna has said in the Gita- khaane, pine, sone, jaagane sabhi kaa niyantran karnaa hota he
 There is a lot of confusion regarding the word Pranayama
 is bhram kaa kaaran yah he ki aaj log praan shabd ke arth ko praaia: bhul gaye hai
 Many people, who call themselves Yogis, forget about this word
 yogi ko is baat kaa praytn karnaa hota he ki vah apane praan ko sushumna main le jaay
 The spinal cord is located in the duct of the spinal cord and reaches under the brain
 yah koi gupt cheez nahin he
 Can be seen with eyes
 kareeb-kareeb kanashtha ungali ke baraabar moti hoti he, thos he, isamen koi chhed nahin he
 Pran and the breath or wind do not know that there is no way for air to enter this pulse and to climb up
 praan ko hawa kaa samanarthak maanakar hi aisi baaten kahi jaati hai ki amuk mahatma ne apni saans ko brahmad main chadha liya
 Control of breath helps in stabilizing the nervous system, but the main aim of the yogi is control of life, not breath
 praan vah shakti he jo nadisanthaan main sanchaar karti he
 All the components of the body and all the metals get life and activity from life itself
 jab sharir ke sthir hone se ore pranayam kii kriya se, praan sushumna kii ore pravrutt hota he to uskaa pravaah neeche kii naadiyon main se khinch jaataa he
 Therefore, these nadis become zero in a way from the outer half
 pranyam kaa abhyaas karnaa or pranayam main safalataa paa janaa do alag alag baaten hai
 But the path of success paves the way of quietness and intense emotion
 jyon-jyon abhyaas drudh hota he, tyon-tyon sadhak ke aatmavishvaas main vruddhi hoti he
 One more thing happens
 vah jitna hi apane chitt ko indriyon or unke vishyon se dur khinchataa he utana hi uski andriya shakti bhi badhati he arthath indriyon kii vishyon ke bhoga kii shakti bhi badhati he
 That is why the name of Pratyahara is taken after Pranayama
 pratyaahaar kaa arth he indriyon ko unke vishyon se kheenchna
 This sermon has been given in the context of disinterest, but it is especially important to reach Pranayam
 asana, pranayam or pratyaahaar ke hi samucchy kaa naam hathyog he
 Sadly, some practitioners stop here
 jo log aage badhate hai unke maarg ko teen vibhaagon main baanta jaataa he: dharna, dhyaan or samadhi
 It is impossible to completely separate these three from each other
 dhaaran pusht hokar dhyaan kaa rup dhaaran karti he or unnat dhyaan hi samadhi kehalaata he
 Patanjali has called all three in moderation
 dharna vah upaay he jisase chitt ko ekagra karne main sahaayta milti he
 Here the word remedy is used singularly, but in fact there are many ways of doing this work
 inamen se kuch kaa charchaa upanishdon main aayaa he
 The word Vidya is used in Vedic Vadmaya
 kisi mantra ke jap, kisi dev, devi yaa mahatma ke vigrah yaa surya, agni, deepashikha aadi ko sharir ke kisi sthanvishesh jese hriday, murgha, til arthath donon aankhon ke bich ke bindu, inamen se kisi jagah kalpana main sthir karnaa, is prakaar ke jo bhi upaay kiye jaayan ve sabhi dharna ke antargat hai
 As Patanjali has written after elaborating some measures - Dhyanamitat Dhyadvadva - Concentrating the mind on an object that feels good can work
 kisi puraana main aisi katha ai he ki apane guru kii ajna se kisi ashikshit vyakti ne apni bhens ke madhyam se chitt ko ekagra karke samadhi praapt kii thi
 The best method of perception is that which is called Nadanusandhan in the old words
 kabir or unke parvarti santon ne ise surat shabd yoga kii sangya di he
 Just as the playful antelope forgets to fill the quartet after being enchanted by the Veena's vocals, similarly the mind of the seeker becomes stagnant by quivering from the effects of the sound
 vah naad koun sa he jisamen chitt kii vrittiyon ko lay karne kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he or yah prayaas kaise kiya jaataa he, ye baaten to gurumukh se hi jaani jaati hai
 The subtlest form of inner feeling is called Pravala, Omkar
 pranav vastut: anuccharyya he
 It can be felt, not euphemism in speech, in the words of Nadvindupanishad: pranav ke anusandhan se, jyotirmaya or kalyankari naad udit hota he
 Then the soul manifests itself in the same way as the moon when the cloud is removed
 aadi shabd aankaar ko paramatma kaa pratik kaha jaataa he
 Its glory has been sung everywhere among yogis
 bible ke us khand main, jise saint jans gaspel kehete hai, pehla hi vaakya is prakaar hai, aarambh main shabd tha
 That word was with God
 vah shabd paramatma tha
 Sufi saints say haif dar bande jism darmani, nor shaunvi saute pake rahmani It is a matter of sorrow that you remain in the bondage of the body and do not listen to the holy divine sound
 chitt kii ekaagratha jyon jyon badhati he tyon tyon sadhakar ko anek prakaar ke anubhav hote hai
 Man is not familiar with the power of his senses
 unase na to kaam letaa he or na lenaa chahta he
 This sounds surprising, but true
 maan lijie, hamaari chakshu yaa shroatra indria kii shakti kal aaj se kai guna bad jaay
 Then do not know how many such things will start to be visible, which we will tremble upon seeing
 ek duusare ke bheetar kii rasinic kriya yadi ek baar dekh pad jaay to apane priy se priy vyakti kii ore se ghrinaa ho jaaygi
 What does our supreme friend say about us sitting in a nearby cell, if i come to listen to this, then it becomes difficult to live
 ham kuch vaasanaon ke putale hai
 With their senses, they work only as long as there is satisfaction of lusts
 isaliye indriyon kii shakti prasupt rahati he parantu jab yogabhyas ke dwaara vaasanaon kaa newnaadhik shaman hota he tab indriyaan nirbaadh rup se kaam kar sakati hai or hamako jagat ke swaroop ke vaastavik rup kaa kuch parichay dilaati hai
 In this world there is a huge store of touch, form, juice and smell, whose power we do not experience
 anrtarmukh hone par bina hamaare prayaas ke hi indriyaan is bhandar kaa dwaar hamaare saamne khol detii hai
 There are many glands of nadis in Sushumna, in which nadis come from many places
 in sthanon ko chakra kehete hai
 The discussion of the six chakras in particular comes in the texts of Yoga
 sabase neeche muladhaar he jo praaia: us jagah par he jahaan sushumna kaa aarambh hota he
 And at the top is the command cycle which is in place of mole
 ise tritiy netra bhi kehete hai
 Walking a little further, the spinal cord joins the brain's umbilical cord
 mastishk ke us sabase upar ke sthaan par jise sharir vigyaan main cerebram kehete hai, sahasrarchakr he
 As one Mahatma has said: moolmantra karband vichaari saat chakra nav shodhai nari
 
 yogi ke praarambhik anubhavon main se kuch kii ore upar sanket kiya gaya he
 Some such experiences are also mentioned in the Shveteshwar Upanishad
 vahaan unhone kaha he ki anal, anil, surya, chandra, khadyot, dhooma, sphuling, taare abhivyaktikarani yoge hainsh yah sab yoga main abhivyakt karaanevaale chihn hai arthath inke dwaara yogi ko yah vishwaas ho saktaa he ki main thik maarg par chal rahaa hoon
 On top of this, it is impossible to describe the experiences that the yogi experiences while reaching the Samadhi
 kaaran yah he ki unka varnan karne ke liye saadhaaran manushya ko saadhaaran bhashaa main koi pratik yaa shabd nahin miltaa
 Good yogis have said in relation to his description that this work is similar to eating dumb jaggery
 purnang manushya bhi kisi vastu ke swaad kaa shabdon main varnan nahin kar saktaa, phir goonga bechaara to asamarth he hi
 Some introduction to the taste of jaggery can also be given on the basis of its resemblance to the taste of fruits or any other sweet thing, but the experience that we usually don't have, is really beyond speech
 samadhi kii sarvocch bhoomika ke kuch neeche tak asmita rah jaati he
 This belief remains as its separate entity
 aham asmi = main hoon kii santan arthath nirantar is bhaavana ke kaaran vahaan tak kaal kii satta he
 After this, the skinny remains ignorant
 uske shay hone kii avasthaa kaa naam asampragyaat samadhi he jisamen avidya kaa bhi kshay ho jaataa he or pradhan se kalpit sambandh kaa viched ho jaataa he
 This is the culmination of yoga
 iske aage phir shastrarth kaa dwaar khul jaataa he
 The teacher of Sankhya says that for the yogi man who has reached here, then the game of nature stops
 duusare logon ke liye jari rahata he
 He explains this as such
 kisi jagah nrity ho rahaa he
 Many people are watching him
 ek vyakti unamem aisa bhi he jisko us nrity main koi abhiruchi nahin he
 He turns his eyes towards the dancer
 uske liye nrity nahin ke baraabar he
 It is interesting for another
 unhone kaha he ki us aja ke saath arthath nitya ke saath aj akonushete = ek aj shayan karata he or jahatenam bhuktavogam tathanya:-uske bhoga se trupt hokar doosraa tyaag detaa he
 The Acharya Sankhya Sammata of Advaita Vedanta does not accept the diversity of men
 unke atirikt or bhi kai daarshnik sampradaay hai jinke apane alag alag siddhant hai
 It has been said earlier that there is no need to fall here in this debate
 jahaan tak yoga ke vyavhaarik rup kii baat he usamen kisi ko virodh nahin he
 The Acharyas of Vedanta also acknowledge the utility of Nirididhyasana and in Vedanta philosophy Vyasa has also supported it in formulas like Asakradabhyasat and Aasin: Sambhavat
 itnaa hi hamaare liye paryaapt he
 Generally Yoga is called Ashtanga, but so far only six limbs have been mentioned from Asana to Samadhi
 shesh do angon ko isaliye nahin choda ki ve anaavashyak hai varan isliye ki vah yogi hi nahin pratyut manushya maatr ke liye param upyogi hai
 Yama is the first among them
 inke sambandh main kaha gaya he ki yah desh kaal, samay se anavchhinn ore saarvbhaum mahabrat hai arthath prayek manushya ko prayek sthaan par prayek samay or prayek avasthaa main prayek vyakti ke saath inkaa paalan karnaa chahie
 The second part is called niyam
 jo log ishwar kii satta ko sweekaar nahin karte unke liye ishwar par nishtha rakhane kaa koi or nahin he
 But those people also have faith in someone who is like God to them
 buddha ko buddhadev ke prati jo nishtha he vah usase kam nahin he jo kisi bhi ishwarwadi ko ishwar par hoti hogi
 There is one more thing
 kisi ko ishwar par shraddha ho yaa na ho, yoga maarg ke upadeshta guru par to anany shraddha honi hi chahie
 For the practitioner, the Guru's place is not less than God
 ishwar ho yaa na ho parantu guru ke hone par to koi andeh ho hi nahin saktaa
 Sahajobai, a disciple of a seeker Charanadas Ji, has said: aaj kal yah baat sunne main aati he ki param purusharth praapt karne ke liye gyaan paryaapt he
 Yoga is not required
 jo log aisa kehete hai, vah gyaan shabd ke arth par gambhirtha se vichaar nahin karte
 There are two types of knowledge - tacism and tacit knowledge
 donon main antar he
 a person can spend his whole life in studying chemistry etc
 to get information about sugar
 shakkar ke anu main kin kin rasinic tatwon ke kitne kitne parmaanu hote hai? shakkar kaise banaai jaati he? usapar koun koun si raasaanik kriya or pratikriyaayein hoti hai? ityadi
 All this is knowledge about sugar
 yah bhi upyogi ho saktaa he parantu shakkar kaa vaastavik gyaan to usee samay hota he jab ek chutki shakkar munh main rakhi jaati he
 This is the philosophy of sugar
 shastron ke adhyayan se jo gyaan praapt hota he vah sachcha aadhyatmik gyaan he or uske prakaash main tadvishyak gyaan bhi puri tarah samaj main aa saktaa hai
 That is why according to the Upanishads, when Yama preached spiritual knowledge to Nachiketa, then along with him the initiation of the Yogavidhi f Kratsnam, otherwise the perception of Nachiketa would remain incomplete
 jo log bhakthi aadi kii sadhana rup se prashansa karte hai unkosh bhi yah dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki yadi unke maarg main vitt ko ekagra karne kaa koi upaay he to vah vastut: yoga kii dharna ang ke antargat he
 It is his wish that Sanatan practice new words excluding Yoga
 yoga ke abhyaas se us prakaar kii shaktiyon kaa udai hota he jinako vibhuti yaa siddhi kehete hai
 If, even after practicing for a sufficient period of time, no such extraordinary powers have been attained in any human being, it should be assumed that he is not following the right path
 parantu siddhiyon main koi jaadu kii baat nahin he
 The power of the senses is very high but generally we do not know it and neither do we use it
 abhayasi ko us shakti kaa parichay miltaa he, usko jagat ke swaroop ke sambandh main aise anubhav hote hai jo dusron ko praapt nahin hai
 Seeing distant or hidden things, listening to the things used, etc
 are within the limits of the innate power of the senses, but for ordinary people, this is a matter of wonder, these will be called accomplishment
 isi prakaar manushya main or bhi bahut si shaktiyaan hen jo sadhran avasthaa main prasupt rahati hai
 Wakes up with the practice of yoga
 yadi ham kisi sadak par kahin ja rahe ho to apane lakshya kii ore badhate hue bhi anayas hi daahine baayein upasthit vishyon ko dekh lenge
 The truth is that anyone who stops to see these subjects will not reach the destination and will remain in the middle
 isiliye kaha gaya he ki jo koi siddhiyon ke liye praytn karata he vah apane ko samadhi se vanchit karata he
 Patanjali has said: arthath ye vibhutiyaan samadhi main baadhak hai parantu samadhi se uthne kii avasthaa main siddhi kehalaati hai
 Govinda, Amitabh Bachchan, Raveena Tandon, Ramya Krishna, Paresh Rawal, Anupam Kher, Sharat Saxena, Sushma Seth, bade miyaan chote miyaan 1998 main bani hindi bhashaa kii ection kamedi film he

 The Shin Dynasty was a dynasty of ancient China that ruled China in a short period from 9 AD to 23 AD
 ise rajvansh to kaha jaataa he lekin isamen samraat sirf ek hi tha
 It came in the middle of the Han Dynasty
 is se pehle ke haan kaal ko 'pashchimi haan rajvansh' kaha jaataa he or iske baad ke haan kaal ko 'purvi haan rajvansh' kaha jaataa he
 The only emperor of the Sheen dynasty was Wang Maung
 pashchimi haan kii rajmata, maharani wang jhengajun wang parivaar se ai thi or uskaa vivaah haan rajpariwaar main hua tha
 Wang Maung was his nephew and belonged to the Wang family
 usne is sambandh kaa faaydaa uthaaya or singhaasana hadap liya
 On 9 AD he declared himself Emperor
