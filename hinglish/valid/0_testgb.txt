 Vayali transliteration is a method of romanization of the Tibetan script using Roman characters that are also available on an ordinary English language typewriter

 Over time, this transliteration scheme became a standard

 The Wylie system does not generally distinguish between these as there is no ambiguity in the possible rules of Tibetan spelling
 The exception is the sequence may be gy-, which is written with either a prefix gram or a subfix y
 In the Wylie system, these are distinguished by inserting a period between a prefix g and the initial Y
 E

 On the basis that internal capitalization was overly cumbersome, the pronunciation in determining the limited utility of, and perhaps superfluous, a Tibetan dictionary capable of using a reader, Wylie specified that if a word was to be To be capitalized, initials should be in line with capital, Western capitalization practices

flame of the world that people who have denied our rectangles, they will definitely burn in the fire of the unknown, then we will burn them We will change the skin and make it so that it tastes amazingly well, it is undoubtedly good and worthwhile on the part of people and those who believe and do good work
 We will reach them in such gardens that the canals will be released under them and there will always be clean and clean and they will keep them in the thickest shade, and the believers themselves command you to protect the lives of people Surrender and when people start deciding the brawls, then decide with justice what good advice does it have There is no doubt that God listens to everyone, watches the believers, pray for God and Rasool And pay attention to those of you who are ruling, and if you fight in any matter, if you keep your faith in God for the sake of God and for the rest of your life, then you should be in favor of God and Rasul in this goodness
 Isn't it better than those of you who cook these thoughts that the book that was brought to you and the books that were brought before you were brought and The heartfelt wish is to make the rulers their rulers, although they are ordered not to listen to them and the devil wants them to be carried far away and when they are told that God has revealed the book And turn towards Rasool, then you see the profiteer that how do you turn away the face that when they face any problem due to their handiwork then why do you have The Swear account Uda that we mean there was not nothing but righteousness and peace Those are the people that only God knows the condition of their heart, please do it to them and ask them and tell them what is affecting them in our heart and we did not send any message to them, but for the sake of God, the command And when those people had taken offense at their lives, if they had come to you and asked for forgiveness from God and Rasul also wanted to be a lover of them, then of course those people would be very sorry Ul gonna find Clement pas tumhaare paravaradigaar kii qasam ye log sachche momin na honge taavakte ki apane bahmi jhagadon main tumko apana haakim banaae phir jo kuch tum faisla karo usase kisi tarah dilatang bhi na hon balki kushi kushi usko maan len or agar ham bani israel kii tarah unpar ye hukum jari kar dete ki tum apane aapako qatl kar daalo yaa shahar badar ho jaao to unamem se chand aadamiyon ke sivaa ye log to usko na karte or agar ye log is baat par amal karte jisaki unhen naseehat kii jaati he to unke haq main bahut behatar hota or bahut sabit qadami se jame rahete or is surat main ham bhi apni taraf se zarur bada acha badla dete And they would also instruct them in the way and the person who requested God and Rasul would be with those men whom God has given his life, that is, Ambia and Siddiquin and Sholah and Salleen and what a good referee these people are ye khuda kaa fazal he or khuda to vaakifakaari main bas he o believers, take good care of your safety, then you have to take care of the family and all of you stand together and there are hawks among you who will surely remain behind, then if there is any problem on you, then God started telling us Big fuss did not exist with them and if God did fizzle on you, then become a stranger in such a way that once you have love in him Neither did i start saying that if i had been with them, i would have achieved great success
 Those people who are present to give the life of the world to the end, should do jihad in the path of God and those who did jihad in the way of God, then If Ghela Ghalib has come, then we will surely give him a big weapon, what has happened to you that those weak and helpless men and women and children in the path of God Do not Jihad in order that Maॅg Duaaॅ from God that AI that our cradle Like this settlement, whose residents are very oppressed, take us out and make someone our guardian on your own side, and you yourself become someone helpful on our own side, the believers fight in the way of God and die fighting in the path of the infuriating Devil
 You fight against the wind gusts of the devil and because the dao of the devil is very rich, have you not looked at the people who were instructed to Hold your hands and offer prayers and offer zakat, but when some of them are afraid of people as if someone is scared of God, but more than that, God said why did you justify jihad on us for a few days And why not give them time to tell them that the hope of the world is a little bit and what they are afraid of is better than that and there is not even a lot of oppression on you people Will be In you shall bring thee death seeking Jho tho how the Go hide in strong pucca domes and if any good is reached to them, then they say that it is from God and if they have any problem then they say that it is because of you that you say that everything is from God Puss, what has happened to those people that they do not understand anything, although when you get some benefit, it is from God and when you get some benefit, it is because of you and We have sent you to the people by making a prophet and the testimony of God is enough, if he had agreed to Rasul, he paid attention to God and who did not take care of you, then you have not sent anything to us by confessing, then you have said that We are fanatical, but when you come out from them, some of them consult the nights against what you said to them, although these people who Uc is also consulted writes her God have you no care of them Do and trust in God and God is enough for the carriage, so do not these people also look at the Quran and if it was from someone other than God, then they would have got a lot of trouble and when they had news of peace or fear So make him instantly famous, although if he reaches his news from the people of Rasool and honesty, then the people who are sure to investigate him

news to the good people, and the Prophets who fear evil people with blessings so that the Prophets After coming, there is no left to the people of God, and God is a great healer, but God testifies on this, which is something that is not on you It is very wise that he has given his witness deliberately even to the angels, although there is enough evidence for the self-evident testimony, of course, the people who defied the Kufr and stopped the path of God, they have to go far away from the path of course
 He refused and neither spared them nor instructed them in any way, but the path of the world in which these people always live And this is a very easy thing for God, people, you have Rasul Dinne Haq has come from the side of God, bring faith is better in your right and if you refuse, then whatever is on the ground and in anticipation is all yours and God is a very big reality
 Do not experience and do not tell the truth except in the glory of God, Mary's son Jesus Christ was a Messenger of God, and his covenants, which God sent to Mary and God God was a believer and believe in his principles and do not be a convict of three
 Be hawk, judge your goodness, Allah is just a man who is a man, he is a man of pak and pakiza
 i am all of that, and God is very much in the carriage, neither Christ can deny the close of God, nor the angels and the person who denies his being closed
 Will rant so Ankhrib only God will all of them raise their hand Pas who People have confided their faith and have done good deeds, they will give them their full blessings but will give more than their fazal and people refuse to be closed and boast they will confuse them in painful wonders and enjoy it It is that those people will not be able to protect themselves except themselves, nor help people, there is no doubt that the argument has come from your family and we We have got a shining Noor with you, those who believe in God and stick to it, then God will also reach them in the plain gardens of their own mercy and happiness and will show them the straight path of their worth

 About 136 years ago, Bohemian monk Gregor John Mendel published his experiments on pea seeds, which marked the beginning of a new era of genetics studies
 inhen lekhon se kalantar main anuvanshiki ke niyam banaae gaye
 He named a new genetic unit in it the gene, and formed the rules for its separation
 thomas hunt morgan ne 1910 main drosophila ke upar shodhakarya karte hue, yah siddh kiya, ki jin gunasutra main, ek sidhi pankti main saje hue rahete hai, tathaa koun sa jin gunasutra main kis jagah par he, iskaa bhi pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he
 In 1926, Hermann Müller discovered that X-rays in the gene of Drosophila lead to genetic mutations, also known as mutations
 san 1944 main yah pramanit hua ki protein nahin, varan di en e hi jin hota he
 In 1953, Watson and Crick discovered the structure of DNA and stated that it is a curved staircase made of two fibers, or double kundalini-shaped
 kisi bhi praani ke sampurna jinom padaarth ko jinom kehete hai
 The human body is made up of thousands of millions of living cells, which we know as cells
 prayek koshika itani sookshm hoti he, ki ham use keval ankhon se nahin dekh sakate hai
 One has to use the microscope to see it
 prayek koshika ke andar ek cendrak hota he
 Inside each nucleus are thread-shaped structures, called chromosomes
 prayek kendrak main 46 gunasutra hote hai
 23 virtues come from father and 23 from mother
 ye gunasutra protein tathaa neucleic amla se milakar bane hote hai
 Which is called DNA
 neucleic amla kii sanrachanaatmak ikai he newcliotide
 When a cell divides into two cells, then its genome also doubles
 koshika kaa vibhaajan hote samay di en e ke donon tantu pruthak ho jate hai or prayek tantu kaa ek nayaa sampoorak tantu, newcliotide peyaring yaa base peyaring ke niyam se banataa he
 Therefore, each new cell has a new DNA and an old fiber
 base peyaring ke niyam ke paalan se jo nayaa tantu banataa he, vah puraane tantu kii hoobahoo pratilipi hota he
 The DNA is made up of four basic bases: ek tantu kaa e duusare tantu ke tii ke saath, tathaa ek tantu kaa si duusare tantu ke ji ke saath hi judata he
 The filaments of one DNA complement the other
 atah yadi ek tantu kaa anukram pataa ho, to duusare kaa gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 There are hydrogen bonds between these two fibers, which connect the two bases

 rachnawadi rashtriya or jaateey pahachaanon ko aksar haalia aitihaasik balon ke rup main dekhte hai, tab bhi jab pahachaanon ko puraatan ke rup main prastut kiya jaataa he
 Elementalists see such introductions as power categories defining social actors, rather than the result of social action
 eriksen ke anusaar, in vaad-vivaadon ko darkinar kar diya gaya, visheshkar maanav vigyaan main un vidwaanon ke prayaason dwaara, jo vibhinn jaateey samoohon or rashtron ke sadasyon dwaara swa-netritv ke badhate raajnneetikaran roopon kaa jawaab dene ke liye kiye gaye
 This is in the context of debates based on multiculturalism spread in countries such as the United States and Canada, with many immigrant populations largely from different cultures, and post-colonialism in the Caribbean and South Asia

 The term "ethnic" and its related forms were used in English between the 14th century and the 19th century as the meaning of "pegan / heathen"

 18–24 main uddhrut) Modern uses of "ethnic" grouping, however, reflect industrial states with a variety of encounters with subordinate groups, such as immigration and colonizing subjects; "ethnic groups" stood out as opposed to "nations" for the purpose of referring to people who have distinct cultural identities and who, through migration or conquest, have become subservient to a foreign state
 is shabd kaa aadhunik upyog apekshaakrit nayaa he-1851 - 1935 main pehali baar jaateey samooh shabd kaa upyog kiya gaya or 1972 main oxford english dictionari main iskaa pravesh hua
 The modern usage definition of the Oxford English Dictionary is as follows: a n great britain or sanyukt rajya america kii saadhaaran bhashaa main angreji shabd "ethnic" ke upyog ke vishay main likhte hue, waleman yah tippanee karte hai ki Thus in present day colloquialism, there is still a circle of foreign people, minority issues and ethnic relations around the words "ethnic" and "ethnicity"
 haalanki, saamaajik vigyaan ke daayre main, iskaa upyog samanyikrut rup se un sabhi maanav samoohon ke liye kiya jaataa he jo spashtatya swayan ko saanskrithik rup se vishisht maanate hai or dusron dwaara bhi maane jate hai
 German sociologist Max Weber is also among the first to introduce the term "ethnic group" to the social sciences, defining it as: maanav samooh jo apane samaan udbhav kii aatmanishth dharna ko ek jaisi shaareerik banaavat yaa rivaajon yaa donon ke kaaran yaa upniveshan or pravaas kii yaadon ke kaaran maanate he; yah dharna samooh gathan ke liye mahatvapurn honi chahie; iske alaava isse koi fark nahin padataa ki ek vishayashrith rakt-sambandh maujuud he yaa nahin
 Weber states that the ethnic groups were Kynstlish, because they were based on subjective belief in a shared gemineshaft
 duusare, saajha gamineshaft main is vishwaas ne samooh kaa nirmaan nahin kiya, apitu samooh ne vishwaas ko banaaya
 Third, group formation was the result of a race to monopolize power and status
 yah us samay kii prachlit prakrutivaadee dharna ke vipareet tha, jiske anusaar samaaj-saanskrithik or logon kii vyavhaarik bhinnataayen, vanshaagat lakshanon or sarvanishtha vanshon se vyutpann pravritiyon se utpann hoti hai, jise us samay "res" kehete the
 Another influential theorist of ethnicity was Fredrik Barth, whose 1969 "ethnic Groups and Boundaries" have been described as instrumental in the spread of the use of the term in social studies in the 1980s and 1990s
 barth, jaateeyata kii prakruti ke nirmaan par bal dene main webar se bhi aage nikal gaye
 For Barth, ethnicity was the only constant negotiation and reawakening by both external attribution and internal self-identification
 barth kii raay main jaateey samooh kram vichchhedi saanskrithik ekaaki yaa taarkik e prioris nahin hai, jisase log swaabhaavik rup se sambandhit hote hai
 They wanted to do away with anthropological assumptions that held culture's bound element and ethnicity as primitive bonds and replaced it with a focus on the segregation between groups
 isliye, jaateey pahchaan kii aapasi sambhddhata par dhyaan kendrit karnaa hi "jaateey samooh or simaaen" he
 Barth writes: "decisive ethnic distinctions do not depend on mobility, contact, and lack of information, but include social processes of exclusion and inclusion that retain discrete categories, despite changes in their participation and membership during individual life histories
 goes
 " In 1978, anthropologist Ronald Cohen claimed that the identification of "ethnic groups" in the use of "social scientists", often more than the native reality, reflected the wrong label: 


 namit jaateey pahchaan jise ham aksar bina soche samajhe, sahitya main die gaye aadhaaron par apana lete hai, aksar manamaane dhang se, yaa usase bhi badtar dhang se adhiropit kiye gaye he
 In this way, he pointed to the fact that an ethnic group's identity, if identified by outsiders such as anthropologists, may differ from the self-identification of that group
 unhone yah bhi bataaya ki upyog ke pehle ke dashakon main, jaateeyata shabd kaa prayog aksar saajha saanskrithik pranaaliyon or saajha viraasat vaale chote samoohon ke sandarbh main "saanskrithik" yaa "janajaatiy" jaise puraane shabdon ke sthaan par prayog kiye jate hai, parantu us "jaateeyata" main donon hi janajaatiy or aadhunik samaajon main samoohon kii pahchaan pranaaliyon main samaantaaon ko varnit karne main sakasham hone kii atirikt khubi thi
 Cohen also suggested that claims of "caste" identity are often colonialist practices and an influence of relations between colonized peoples and nation-states
 saamaajik vaigyanikon ne isliye is baat par dhyaan kendrit kiya ki kaise, kab or kyon jaateey pahchaan ke vibhinn suchak khaas ban jate hai
 Therefore, anthropologist Joan Vincent noted that ethnic boundaries are often of unstable character
 ronaald kohen ne nishkarsh nikaala ki jaateeyata "antarveshan or ekantik kii ek nirmaanadhin dvibhaajaneekaran shrinkhalaa he"
 ve joan vincent ke avlokan se sahamat hai ki "jaateeyata 


 ko seemaa ke sandarbh main, raajnneetik jutav ke vishisht aavashyaktaaon ke sambandh main, sankuchit yaa vistrut kiya ja saktaa he
 This may be the reason why dynasty is sometimes an indicator of ethnicity and sometimes is not: which trait of ethnicity is predominant and depends on whether people are promoting ethnic boundaries up or down and They amplify them above or below it generally depends on the political situation
 jaateey vargeekaran ko dusron dwaara labling yaa aatm-pahchaan dwaara paribhaashit kiye jane kii samasya se bachane ke liye, yah upaay sujhaayaa gaya ki in avadharanaon jaise "jaateey shreniyan", "jaateey networkon" or "jaateey samudaayon" yaa "prajati" ko ek duusare se alag kiya jaae
 Many different approaches have been used by various social scientists to understand ethnicity, when they tried to understand the nature of ethnicity as a factor in human life and society
 is tarah ke tareekon ke udhaaharan hai: aadimavad, tathvikwaad, sthayitvvaad, rachnawad, aadhunikwaad or karnavaad
 Prior to Weber, race and ethnicity were often seen as two aspects of the same thing
 1900 ke aas-paas or usase pehle jaateeyata kii tathvik aadimavaadi samaj pradhan thi, logon ke bich saanskrithik bhinnata ko viraasat main mili lakshanon or pravritiyon ke parinaam ke rup main dekha jaataa tha
 At the same time "sciences" such as enlightenment claimed that they were able to correlate cultural and behavioral properties between different populations by their external physical structure, such as the shape of the skull
 webar dwaara jaateeyata ko ek saamaajik nirmaan ke rup main parichay die jane par, nasl or jaateeyata ek duusare se vibhajit kiye gaye
 According to biology a social belief rested on well-defined races
 1950 main unesco kaa bayaan "da res queschan" main, jo us samay ke kuch antarrashtriya str par khyaati praapt buddhijiviyon, dwaara hastakshrit kiya gaya, sujhaayaa gaya: "yah jaruri nahin he ki rashtriya, dharmik, bhugolic, bhashaai or saanskrithik samooh nasleey samoohon ke saath mail khaae: or is tarah ke samoohon kii saanskrithik visheshtaon kaa nasleey gunon ke saath koi pradarshit anuvanshik lakshan sambandh nahin he
 Because habitually serious errors in the use of the word "race" in general lore, it is better to talk about 'ethnic groups' than the word "race" when referring to human race
 " In 1982, American cultural anthropologists, collecting forty years of ethnographic research, argue that racial and ethnic categories are symbolic indicators of the ways in which people from different parts of the world have joined the global economy: woolf ke anusaar, europea vyapaarik vistaar kii avadhi ke dauraan naslon kaa or poonjivadi vistaar kii avadhi ke dauraan jaateey samoohon kaa, nirmaan or samavisht kiya gaya
 Ethnicity often indicates shared cultural, linguistic, behavioral, or religious traits
 udhaaharan ke liye, khud ko yahudee yaa arab kahalaane ke liye turant bhashaai, dharmik, saanskrithik or nasleey gunon ke put ko utpann karnaa hoga jise prayek jaateey shrenee main samaan mana jaataa he
 Such broad ethnic categories have also been termed as ethnicity
 yah unhen choti, adhik vyaktiparak jaateey gunon se pruthak karata he, jise aksar sookshmjatiyata kaha jaataa he
 In some cases, particularly those involving international migration, or colonial expansion, ethnicity is associated with nationality
 maanavvigyaani or itihaaskaar, jo arnest gelnar or benedict anderson dwaara prastaavit jaateeyata ke aadhuniktaavaadi samaj kaa paalan karte hai, ve raashtra or rashtrawaad ko satrahavin sadi main aadhunik rajya pranali ke saath viksit hote hue dekhte hai
 He ended with the emergence of "nation-states" in which the presumptive boundaries of the nation converge with state boundaries
 is prakaar, pashchim main, jaateeyata kii dharna, nasl or raashtra kii tarah, europea upniveshik vistaar ke sandarbh main viksit hone lagi, jab vanikwaad or poonjeevaad jansankhya ke vaishvik andolanon ko badhaava de rahaa tha or saath hi saath rajya simaaen adhik spasht or sakhti se paribhaashit kii ja rahi thim
 In the nineteenth century, modern states commonly sought legitimacy through claims to represent "nations"
 haalanki, raashtra-rajya, nishchit taur par us aabaadi ko shaamil karata he jo kisi ek yaa anya kaarnon se rashtriya jivan se apvarjit kar die gaye hai
 Consequently, members of excluded groups will either demand inclusion on the basis of equality, or self-government, sometimes to the extent of complete political isolation in their own nation-state
 in paristhitiyon main - jab log ek rajya se duusare rajya main sthanantarit hote hai, yaa ek rajya par vijay praapt karte hai yaa apni rashtriya seemaa ke pare logon ke upnivesh banaate hai - jaateey samooh aise logon dwaara banaai gai, jinaki pahchaan ek raashtra ke saath he, parantu ve rahete duusare rajya main hai
 Sometimes ethnic groups become subject to hostile attitudes and actions by the country or its constituents
 beesvin sadi main, log yah tark dene lage ki jaateey samoohon ke bich yaa ek jaateey samooh ke sadasyon or rajya ke bich sangharsh ko in do main se ek tareeke se suljhaayaa janaa chahie
 Some, such as Eugen Habermas and Bruce Barry, have argued that the legitimacy of modern states should be based on the notion of political rights of the autonomous individual public
 is vichaar ke anusaar, rajya ko jaateey, rashtriya yaa nasleey pahchaan ko manyata dene ke bajaay sabhi vyaktiyon kii raajnneetik or kanoonee samanta lagu kerani chahie
 Others, such as Charles Taylor and Will Camelika, argue that the notion of individual autonomy is in itself a cultural construct
 is vichaar ke anusaar, rajyon ko apni jaateey pahchaan ko samajhnaa chahie or aisi prakriyaaon ko viksit karnaa chahie jinke madhyam se jaateey samoohon kii vishesh jaruraton ko raashtra-rajya kii simaaon ke bheetar samyojit kiya ja sake
 The nineteenth century saw the emergence of political theory of ethnic nationalism, when the concept of race was combined with nationalism by German theorists such as Johann Gottfried von Herder
 samaaj ke jaateey sambandhon par tark saadhy rup se itihaas yaa aitihaasik sandarbh kaa bahishkaar kiye jane tak, dhyaan kendrit karne ke udhaaharan rashtravaadi lakshyon ke samarthan main falit hue

 The history of latecomers in the model of the nation state, such as the pre and South Eastern Europe arising after the disintegration of the Ottoman and austro-hungarian empires, as well as those that originated from the former USSR, was marked by inter-ethnic conflict is

 is prakaar, yah sangharsh aksar gumraah karne ke liye ankit or naagarik yuddh ke rup main chitrit kiya gaya, jabaki ve ek bahu-jaateey rajya main ek antar-jaateey sangharsh hote hai
 In the United States, the term "ethnic" is used in a much broader sense than is commonly used in some other countries
 jaateeyata aam taur par sambandhit samoohon ke sangrahan ko sanderbhit karata he, jiskaa adhik sambandh akruti vigyaan, vishesh rup se twachaa ke rang par aadhaarit he or raajnneetik simaaon par nahin
 The term "nationality" is commonly used more for this purpose
 america main sarvaadhik vishisht rup se, latin america vyutpann aabaadi ko "hispanic" yaa "latino" jaateeyata main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 Several previously named oriental ethnic groups are now classified as Asian racial groups for the census
 "blike" or "africa america" alag hote hue bhi, donon kaa america ke jaateey shreniyon ke rup main upyog kiya jaataa he
 In the late 1980s, the term "african American", was considered a most appropriate and politically correct race title
 jabaki ise america ateet ke nasleey anyaay se visthaapan ke rup main lakshith kiya gaya tha, jo "blike res" ke aitahaasik drushtikon se judaa tha, yah bade paimaane par blike, colord, nigro or unke samaan shabdon kaa, jo kisi bhi kaali twachaa vaale vyakti kaa bina uski bhugolic mul kii parvaah kiye zikr karti he, maatr saamaanya pratisthaapan ban gaya
 Similarly, fair-skinned Americans from Africa are not considered "african American"
 kai africa america bahu jaateey hai
 More than half of African Americans are also descendants of great-grandfather Europeans, and only 5 percent of great-grandfather descendants are Native Americans
 "aam taur par white shabd un logon kaa varnan karata he jinaki vansh parampara ke chihn europe main paae jate hai or jo ab sanyukt rajya america main based hai
 Middle Easterners may also occasionally be included in the "white" category
 inamen dakshin pashchim asia or uttari africa ke log or saath hi saath arab deshon, iraan, afghanistan or pakistan ke log shaamil he
 All of the above mentioned are classified as part of the "white" ethnic group according to the US Census classification

 In the United Kingdom, many different ethnic classifications, both formal and informal, are made

 entered his criticism

 The language of Babu Shyam Sundar Das is pure literary Hindi, in which the corresponding words of Sanskrit are predominant
 bhashaa ke sambandh main unka vichaar tha- 'jab ham videshi bhaavon ke saath videshi shabdon ko grahan karen tab unhen aisa bana len ki unamem se videshipan nikal jaae or ve apane hokar hamaare vyakaran ke niyamon se anushaasit hon
 'therefore, wherever they have used the prevalent words of' Urdu 'in their language, they have removed their character, they have used them by removing the dots under the words pen, drill, law etc
 and changing their pronunciation
 isi prakaar sanskrit ke shabdon kii clishtataa dur kar ke unhen hindi main saral dhang se likhaa he- jaise- kaary ke sthaan par kaary, anjan ke sthaan par anjan
 Babu Shyamsunder Das was of the opinion about the word selection- 'the first place is the words of pure Hindi, behind it the easy and popular words of Sanskrit, behind it the simple and popular words of foreign languages like Persian and behind it the obsolete of Sanskrit
 Let the words be spaced
 farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke kathin shabdon kaa prayog kadaapi na ho
 Babu Shyam Sundar Das has written mainly in two types of styles - 1
 vichaaratmak style- vichaaratmak style main vichaaratmak niabandh likhe gaye hai
 The sentences in this style are short and expressive
 bhashaa sabal, saral or pravahamayi he
 For example- 'gopiyo kaa sneh badhaya he
 They are compiled with Krishna in Ras Leela
 anek utsav manaati he
 This behavior of Premmayi gopikas is very delightful
 usamen kahin se aswabhaaviktaa nahin aa saki
 2
 Exploratory Style - The explanatory style is used in exploratory essays
 inamen vaakya apekshaakrit kuch lambey hai
 There is a plethora of corresponding words in the language
 vishay kii gahanta tathaa shushkta ke kaaran yah style main kuch shushk or rahit he
 See an example of this type of style- 'yah jivan-sangram do bhinn sabhyataaon ke sangharshan se or bhi teevr or dukhamay prathit hone laga he
 According to this condition, when literature is generated and encouraging the brain of the society, then only the signs of real progress will be seen and its welfare will give the country the glory of modern times
 babu shyaam sundardaas kii kisi prakaar kii style main alankaaron kii sajaavat nahin pai jaati
 Sayings and idioms have been used sparingly
 apane vichaaron ko bhalee prakaar samajhane ke liye babu shyaam sundar das ne ek hi baat ko 'saransh yah he' 'athwa', 'jaise' aadi shabdon ke saath baar-baar duharaaya he
 In Hindi literature, Babu Shyam Sundar Das has been replaced as his Hindi promoter and Hindi director

 Ramchandra Shukla has written in the history of Hindi literature: shyaam sundar das na keval santhaan-nirmaataa the, balki prabandh-kala main bhi bejod the
 He worked determinedly to overcome the shortages of all areas of literature
 bhashaa tatvavetta ke rup main yaa siddhanton ke vyaakhyaata rup main unheen kii uplabdhiyon ke kaaran saahityalochan hindi ke vidhyaarthiyon kaa bahut samay tak kanthhaar bana rahaa
 In his mind, the notion remained that the basis of the theoretical review of Hindi should be made by combining Sanskrit and Western criticism-principles and with a special harmony
 shyaam sundar das se pehle hindi or nagari lipi ke liye vishesh rup se sankatpurna samay tha
 Pratap Narayan Mishra had established meetings for the promotion of Hindi in many places
 aisi hi ek sabha 1884 main ‘hindi uddharini pratinidhi madhya bharat sabha’ ke naam se prayag main pratishthit kii gayi
 Bharatendu Harishchandra also ventured several times for Nagari's entry into government offices, but he could not succeed
 iske baavjood praytn baraabar chalata rahaa
 Due to the court language being Urdu, the number of newly educated Urdu readers was more, due to which the work of publishing Hindi books could not proceed
 is sahitya-sankat ke atirikt nagari kaa pravesh sarkari dacrataron main na hone se nagari jaanane vaali janata ke saamne ghor sankat tha
 In the same period, Kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha was established in 1893 from the industry of some enthusiastic students, among whom Babu Shyam Sundar Das was the chief
 yahan bhi ramchandra shukla kaa kathan yaad rakhana chahie ki, ‘sach puuchhie to is sabha kii sari samruddhi or kirti babu shyaam sundar das ke tyaag or satat parishram kaa fal he
 They continued to do it from the beginning till the end and kept it ready in many big industries
 iske pratham sabhapati bhaaratendu ke fufere bhai radhakrishna das hue
 The Nagari Prachar movement created new enthusiasm among Hindi-lovers and many people became devoted to the growth of literature
