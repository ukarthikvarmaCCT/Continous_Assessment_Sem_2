 Any object falling from above comes directly towards the earth
 aisa prathit hota he, maano koi alakshya or agyaat shakti use prithvi kii ore khinch rahi he
 The Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, first highlighted the fact that when a body falls from the top, it comes to Earth with a fixed acceleration
 twaran kaa yah maan sabhi vastuon ke liye ek sa rahata he
 He has confirmed this conclusion by experiments and mathematical considerations
 iske baad sar ijak newton ne apni moulik khojon ke aadhaar par bataaya ki keval prithvi hi nahin, apitu vishwa kaa prayek kan prayek duusare kan ko apni ore aakarshith karata rahata he
 The force of attraction acting between two particles is proportional to the product of the codes of those particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them
 kanon ke bich kaary karanevaale parsparik aakarshan ko gurutvkarshan tathaa usase utpann bal ko gurutvkarshan bal kaha jaataa he
 The above law propounded by Newton is called Newton's law of gravity
 kabhi-kabhi is niyam ko "gurutvkarshan kaa pratilom varg niyam" bhi kaha jaataa he
 The above rule can be expressed in formula form as: Suppose m1 and codon m2 are two objects spaced at d distance
 unke bich kaary karanevaale bal f kaa maan hoga : Here g is a proportional constant whose value is the same for all substances
 ise gurutveey sthiraank kehete hai
 This constant has a dimension and the numeric value depends on the unit used
 sutara dwaara kisi pind par prithvi ke kaaran laganevaale aakarshan bal kii gananaa kii ja sakati he
 Suppose the code of the Earth is m and there is a body with the code m on its surface
 prithvi kii sanhati yadi uske centre par hi sanghanit maani jaae or prithvi kaa ardhavyas r ho to prithvi dwaara us pind par kaary karanevaala aakarshan bal : According to Newton's Second Movement, the force exerted on a body is equal to the product of the body and acceleration of that body
 at: prithvi ke aakarshan ke prabhaav main mukt rup se giranevaale pind par kaary karanevaala gurutvkarshan bal: Where g is the gravitational acceleration of that body, so arthath g= pind kii ikai sanhati par kaary karanevaala bal
 But from the equation atev gurutvajanit twaran g ko bahudhaa ‘prithvi’ ke gurutvkarshan kii tivrata bhi kehete hai
 The problem of finding the value of gravitation constant g attracted the attention of scientists only after Newton's law of gravity was presented
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki yah prakruti ke mul niyatanko main se ek he or desh, kaal tathaa paristhiti se sarvatha nirpeksh he
 Therefore, it is called universal constant
 saath hi, yah prithvi kii sanhati se bhi sambandhit kiya ja saktaa he 
 Therefore, to know the density and density of the earth, it also requires knowledge of its value
 yah nimnlikhit vivechan se spasht ho jayega : Comparing the equation and in kintu prithvi kii maatra Where d is the mean density of the Earth
 g = g p r3 d / r2= g p r d Ie GD = 3 g / is sutara se yah spasht he ki g yaa d main se ek kaa maan gyaat karne ke liye duusare kaa maan gyaat hona chahie
 Therefore, before finding the density of the earth, it was only natural to attract the attention of scientists towards methods to determine the exact value of G
 gurutv niyatank kaa maan gyaat karne ke li, kiye janevaale vaigyanik prayaason ko ham teen kotiyon main vibhakt kar sakate hai : The names of booger Neville Masquelyn Airy and Fawn Sterneck are notable among those who have followed this method
 iskaa siddhant sankshep main is prakaar he : Suppose a body of m samhita is attracted by the earth
 spasht he ki yah aakarshan bal us pind ke bhaar w ke baraabar hoga
 Now if a lateral force is also applied to that body by another large natural body, then the lateral force according to Newton's law f = f m m’ / d2 xxrep 25 
 Here m 'is the code of that large natural body and d is the distance between it and the small body

 If the Earth's Code m and radius r, then the gravitational force acting on that body w = g m m / r2 xxrep 12 
 Now if any other heavy body of m code is placed under this body and the distance between the centers of both bodies is d, then due to mutual attraction of both, the first body will bend more down, that is, its weight will increase

 In mathematics, the sum of a sequence of numbers is called a series
 yadi padon kii sankhya aparimit ho, to is shrenee ko anant shrenee kehete hai
 If the given sequence is {a 1, a 2, a 3,


} { \ displaystyle \ left \ {a_ {1}, \ a_ {2}, \ a_ {3}, \ dots \ right \ }}, s n { \ displaystyle S_ {n}}, the sum of the first n terms of the sequence, is called n as the partial sum
 arthath a range is called convergent when the sequence of its partial sums is {S 1, s 2, s 3,


} { \ displaystyle \ left \ {S_ {1}, \ S_ {2}, \ S_ {3}, \ dots \ right \ }} be convergent
 jab koi shrenee abhisari nahin hoti to use apsaari kehete hai
 Let Sn = a1 + 


 + an is the sum of the first terms n terms of this category
 yadi n ke anant kii ore agrasar hone par Sn ek parimit seemaa s kii ore agrasar ho, to shrenee 'S kii ore abhisaarit' kahi jaati he tathaa s 'shrenee kaa yoga' kehalaata he
 If Sn is moving towards + infinite or - infinite, then the category is said to be diverted to + infinite or - infinite depending on the situation
 yadi Sn parimit rup se dolit hota he, arthath yadi prayek n ke liye
 Sn
 < k he or yadi Sn kisi seemaa kii ore agrasar nahin hota he, to shrenee parimit rup se dolit karti kahi jaati he
 If n is leading to infinity,
 Sn
 The range is said to be infinitely oscillating if the Sn remains infinite and does not move towards any boundary
 udhaaharan ke liye, shrenee 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 +


ke liye n ke sam yaa visham hone ke anusaar Sn = 0 yaa 1 he
 Hence, this series is finite oscillation
 shrenee 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + xxrep 4 
 ke liye S2n = n, S2n-1 = n he or yah shrenee anant rup se dolan karti he
 Hence, the convergence, or divergence, of a series depends on the convergence, or divergence, of a sequence of incomplete sums {sn}
 saamanyat: jo shrenee abhisaarit nahin hoti, vah apsaarit kahi jaati he
 Sn = / for the geometric range 1 + r + r2 + 


 if | r | <1; And Sn = n if r = 1
 yadi
 r
 <1 he, to yah shrenee yoga 1 kii ore abhisaarit hoti he, anyathaa apsaarit rahati he
 Finding the definitive expression for s is not always easy
 at: ham yah jaanane ke liye ki koi vishisht shrenee abhisari he yaa nahin, abhisari or apsaari kii parikshavidhiyon kaa prayog karte hai
 If a series is composed of positive terms only, then {sn} after a term will be an incremental sequence and the necessary and sufficient agreement for the convergence of such an incremental sequence is that it is finite, that is, the existence of such a constant amount K
 That Sn <K for all values of n

 Darius the Great built the largest and most magnificent palace in Persepolis on the west side
 This palace was called Apadana
 raajaaon ke raja ne iskaa istemaal aadhikarik darshakon ke liye kiya
 Work began in 515 BC
 unke bete zarksis pratham ne ise 30 saal baad puraa kiya
 The palace had a square grand hall with each arm 60 m in length and consisting of seventy-two pillars, of which thirteen pillars still lie on a wide platform

 To the south of the Grand Hall was built a series of rooms for storage

 To protect the roof from erosion, vertical drains were built into the brick walls

 These included the Tachara palace which was built under Darius i and the royal treasury which was built in 510 BC
 And was started by Darius in 480 BC
 Was completed by Xerxes

 Council Hall, Triplion Hall, Palaces of D, G, H, storerooms, stables and chambers, semi-built gateways and some of the diverse structures of Persepolis are located in the mountainside near the southeastern corner of Terrace
 aam taur par is baat ko sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki sirus mahaan ko pasrgadaaye main dafnaaya gaya tha
 If it is true that Cambyses ii's body was brought home "for the Persians", then the burial place must be somewhere next to his father's grave
 Stacius believes that it was the custom that the king had to build a tomb for himself during his lifetime
 isliye naksh-e rustam main dafan raajaaon main shaayad dariyas mahaan, zarksis pratham, artaperxis pratham or dariyas dwitiya shaamil ho sakate hai
 Xerxes II, who ruled for a very short period of time, would hardly have received such a magnificent tomb and the same happened to Sogdianus, who had forcibly taken possession
 So two whole graves located behind Takht-e Jamshid will belong to Artazerxis II and Artazerxis III
 The unfinished tomb may have belonged to Arceus of Persia who ruled for two years and if this tomb is not his own it would be that of Darius III who is one of those whom his corpses are said to have "for the Persians"
 Was brought usee style ke khandhiron kaa ek or chota samooh hajjabad gaanv main paaya gaya he jo pulver par sthit he jahaan se takht-e jamshid tak jane main kaaphi acha samay lag saktaa he
 Only one building was built from them, which existed until 900 years ago and was used as the mosque of the then existing Istkhar city
 sirus mahaan ko pasrgadaaye main dafnaaya gaya tha jise stacius ne apana shahar bataaya he
 Since Persepolis buildings began with Darius i when judged on the basis of inscriptions, it was probably under this king with whom it moved to a new branch of the royal mansion, making Persepolis the capital of Persia
 haalaanki samrajya ke shaskaon ke nivas ke rup main ek kathin alpine kshetra main ek doordaraj kaa sthaan suvidha se bahut dur tha

 At that time Alexander burnt the "palaces" or "palaces" which are now known as the ruins of takht-e-jamshid
 stols kii chaanbin se pataa chalata he ki kam se kam inamen se ek, zarksis dwaara banwaaya gaya mahal se iske jalakar nasht hone kaa saboot miltaa he
 The area described by Diodorus after Clytarchus belongs to the takht-e-jamshid, for example in terms of important details, being supported by the mountain in the east

 deodoras kaa kahana he ki shahi kabron vaale mahal ke peeche kii taraf kii chattan itani khadi he ki shavon ko keval yantric upkarnon dwaara hi unke antim vishram sthal tak le jaaya ja saktaa tha
 This is not true of the tombs behind takht-e-jamshid as far as F
C
 Stolz has clearly seen, one can easily climb
 duusari taraf yahi baat naksh e rustam ke kabron ke bare main ekadam sach he
 Stolz accordingly introduced the theory that the royal palace of Parecepolis was located quite close to naksh-e-rustam and over time merged into formless earthen bodies under which the ruins may be hidden
 haalaanki takht e jamshid kaa vishaal khandhar or chat, jise itani mehnat se banaaya gaya tha, badi mushkil se mehalon ke khandhiron ke alaava or kuch ho saktaa he; udhaaharan ke taur par farsiyon ke paas kam se kam dariyas or zarksis ke samay main aisi koi cheez nahin thi
 Furthermore, according to the much older Persian tradition, only three architectural wonders were reported to have been attributed to the magnificent Mahani Humgi, Cyrus's tomb at Pasargadae, the building of Hajjlabad and the great terrace
 isliye sikandar dwaara nasht kiye gaye shahi mehalon ke saath in antim sanrachanaon kii pahchaan sabase surakshit he
 Clytarchus, who seldom saw this palace himself, in his usual careless manner considered the graves behind the palace to be the tomb of naqsh-e-rustom; In fact he seems to think that all the royal tombs are in one place

 After several months Alexander allowed his troops to loot Persepolis
 The eastern palace of Xerxes caught fire and spread to the rest of the city

 Champu is a distinction of audio poetry, that is, mixed poetry of prose-verse is called Champu
 gadhy tathaa padya mishrit kavy ko "champu" kehete hai
 This mode of poetry has not been mentioned by the ancient masters of literature - Bhamah, Dandi, Vamana etc
 yon gadhy padyamay style kaa prayog vaidic sahitya, buddha jataka, jatakamala aadi ati pracheen sahitya main bhi miltaa he
 The beginning of the Champukavya tradition is derived from the Atharva Veda
 champoo naam ke prakrut kavy kii rachana dasvin shatee ke pehle nahin hui
 'nalchampu', composed by Trivikram Bhatt, which is an early tenth century work, is a famous example of Champu
 iske atirikt somdev suri dwaara rachit yashatilak, bhojraj krit champoo ramayana, kavi karnapuri krit anandavrindavan, gopal champoo, nilkantha champoo or champoo bharat dasvin se satrahavin shatee tak ke udhaaharan hai
 This poetic form could not become more popular nor did it get special recognition in poetry
 hindi main yashodhara ko champoo-kavy kaha jaataa he, kyonki usamen gadhy-padya donon kaa prayog hua he
 The proper division of this mixture of prose and verse seems to be that the description of affective subjects should be presented by verse and descriptive subjects should be presented by prose
 parantu champurchayitaaon ne is manovaigyanik vaishishty par vishesh dhyaan na dekar donon ke sanmishran main apni swatantra ichha tathaa vaiyaktik abhiruchi ko hi mahatv diya he
 The mixture of prose-poetry is ancient in Sanskrit literature, but the poetic style, the possessive noun of "champu", cannot be considered as ancient as the compositional mixture of prose-verse
 gadhy-padya kii mishrit rachana krishna yajurvedic samhitaon main uplabdh hoti he
 Pali natives also have the achievement of the storyline in prose and the original formulaic allusions in verse
 parantu kavyatatv se virahit hone ke kaaran inhen ham "champu" kaa drushtaant kisi prakaar nahin maan sakate
 The Prayagprashasti of Samudragupta composed by Harishan and the Buddhist poet Ayanshur Praneeth Jatakamala can be considered primitive forms of Champu, as in the first, the Digvijay of Samudragupta and 34 Jatakas in the second are described in elaborate prose verse taking shelter of pure poetic style
 prathit hota he ki champu gadhykavy kaa hi ek paribrihit rup he or isiliye gadhykavy ke suvarnyug ke ananthar navam shatee ke aasapaas is kavyarup kaa udai hua
 The first paradigm of Champu poetry is the Nalchampu of Trivikram Bhatt in which the characteristic of Champu springs up
 dakshin ke rashtrakutvanshi raja krishna ke pautra, raja jagatug or lakshmi ke putr, indraraj ke aashray main rahakar trivikram ne is ruchir champu kii rachana kii thi
 The coronation of Indraj was in the year 972 and due to his dependence, the poet also has the same time as the first half of the tenth century

 kavi karnpur kaa anandavrindavan champu, tathaa jeev goswami kaa gopalchampu saras kavy kii drushti se nitant safal kavy hai
 The first of these poems gives a detailed and vivid description of Krishna's balalilas, the second verse is a poignant description of Krishna's entire character
 "virmitroday" ke prakhyat rachayita mitra mishra kaa "aanandakand champu" krishnaparak champuon main ek ruchir shrunkhlaa jodta he

 sabhi geet majaruh sultanpuri ne likhe tathaa sangeet rahul dev burman ne diya he| The flow of charged particles through a transmission medium is called electric conduction
 aaveshon ke pravaah se vidyut dhara banati he
 The flow of charges is possible for two reasons - jab kisi chaalak ke dono siron ke bich main vibhavaantar sthapit kiya jaataa he, to chaalak ke bheetar upasthit electron nimna vibhav se ucch vibhav kii ore gati karnaa armbh kar dete hai
 This process is called electric conduction
 jab aavesh ke dharakon kaa ghanatv alag-alag sthaan par samaan na ho balki alag-alag ho
 The conduction of metals and resistors is well explained by Ohm's law

 Charge-holders move in a direction where the density of charge is low
 yadi aavesh-dharak hole hai to isamen n ke sthaan par hole ghanatv kaa rinatmak maan rakhaa jaayegaa

 Due to the similarity between the Mayan Indian race of Central America and the architecture of ancient Egypt, it was also speculated that Indians came to America from Egypt or Egypt influenced countries

 Before ancient anthropological discoveries were made in America, there was also the possibility that the ancestors of Indians had developed as an independent branch of mankind on this land, but now it can be said with certainty that mankind on the American continents In the development of a branch of the Kumbh, only the preserved remains of lemurs, tarsiers and monkeys of certain castes have been found on this territory
 pracheen maanav jatiyon ke adhyeta parishrampurvak khoj karne par bhi nikatmanav vanar athwa pracheen maanav koi avshesh yahan nahin paa sake hai
 In this way, it can be said that there was no possibility of independent development of any branch of mankind here and the ancestors of the oldest inhabitants of this place would have settled here from any other part of the world
 visheshgyon kaa mat he ki maanav is bhaag main bering street ke maarg se asia se aayaa
 In terms of physical characteristics, Indians can be unambiguously considered a branch of the Mongoloid species of Asia
 asiyon se alaska ke maarg dwaara indianon ke jo purvaj america aae the, nishchit rup se ve aadhunik maanav athwa "homo sepiuns" ke str tak viksit ho chuke the
 They must also have brought with them many elements of their original Asian culture
 ve sambhavat: agni ke upyog se parichit the or unhone prastaryugin samskruti ke astr shastron or upkarnon kaa nirmaan or upyog bhi sikh liya tha
 From the difficult cold they encountered on this route, it can be easily inferred that they must have covered their body with some kind of garment and possibly even temporary house-building art
 Must have been familiar

 For several thousand years from Asia, human groups in different parties kept coming to America's land
 kai sau varsho tak in samoohon ko barf se dhake sthalmarg se hi aana padaa; parantu yah sambhav he ki baad main aanevaale samooh aanshik rup se naavon main bhi yatra kar sake hon
 The study of the remains of ancient Indians has confirmed the belief that the groups that came here earlier had more of the physical characteristics of the australoid-mongol species, and that later groups had predominance of elements of the Mongoloid species
 kalantar main in samoohon ke parsparik mishran se indianon main mongolaide prajati kii shareerik visheshtaayen pramukh ho gai

 Stone tools, rubbish, bone and horn tools made by pressure or wear, the use of fire, the art of making traps and crates, bow and spear throwing instruments and domesticated dogs are probably the main elements of the original culture of Indians
 Can go asia se america aakar indianon ke purvaj apni mul asian shakha se ekadam alag ho gaye athwa unhone usase kisi prakaar kaa sambandh banaae rakhaa, is vishay par vidwaanon main matbhed he
 On the basis of the physical difficulties in maintaining such relations, it can be easily inferred that even if there was a relationship among these terrains, it would have been very limited in its extent and influence
 kalantar main saanskrithik vikaas kii jo dishaaen in samoohon ne apanaai ve bahm samskritiyon se prabhavit nahin hui
 These groups developed the new-age culture independently

 Also, he first started cultivating vegetation like maize, cocoa, manioc or cassava, tobacco and various types of beans

 In linguistics, 'syllable' or syllable is an organized unit of sounds
 kisi bhi shabd ko anshon main todakar bolaa ja saktaa he or shabdaansh shabd ke vah ansh hote hai jinhen or zyaada chota nahin banaaya ja saktaa varanaa shabd kii dhvaniyaan badal jaati hai
 For example, the word 'suddenly' has three syllables - 'A', 'cha' and 'naq'
 yadi ruk-ruk kar 'a-chaa-nak' bolaa jaye to shabd ke teenon shabdaansh khandit rup se dekhe ja sakate hai lekin shabd kaa uccharan sunne main sahi prathit hota he
 If 'nak' is broken further, the sounds of the word become wrong - 'a-cha-na-k'
 This word is also not called 'a-chan-k' because it also makes the pronunciation wrong
 kuch chote shabdon main ek hi shabdaansh hota he, jaise 'main', 'kaan', 'haath', 'chal' or 'ja'
 kuch shabdon main do shabdaansh hote hai, jaise 'chalakar', khaanaa, rumal or sabzi 
 Some have three or more syllables, such as 'important' and 'international'
 akshar shabd kaa arth he - 'jo na ghat sake, na nasht ho sake'
 It was earlier used for 'speech' or 'speech' and for syllable
 'varna' ke liye bhi akshar kaa prayog kiya jaataa rahaa
 This is the reason that the word 'letter' is also commonly used today for the characters expressed by script signs
 bhashaa ke vaigyanik adhyayan ne akshar ko angreji 'silabal' kaa arth pradaan kar diya he, jisamen swar, swar tathaa vyanjan, anuswaar sahit swar yaa vyanjan dhvaniyaan sammilit maani jaati hai
 a unit of sound or sound community spoken in the same stroke or force is called akshara
 ikai kii pruthakta kaa aadhaar swar yaa swararat vyanjan hota he
 The consonant sound comes as a part of the vowel in an accent or on the ante
 astu, akshar main swar hi merudand he
 Neither a vowel can be separated from a vowel, nor is a vowel formed without vowels or vowel consonants
 uccharan main yadi vyanjan moti kii tarah he to swar dhaage kii tarah
 If the voice is a strong emperor then the consonant is the king
 isi aadhaar par praayah akshar ko swar kaa paryaay maan liya jaataa he, kintu aisa he nahin, phir bhi akshar nirmaan main swar kaa atyadhik mahatv hota he
 Consonant sounds in some languages also help in letter formation
 angreji bhashaa main na, r, l jaisi vyanjan dhvaniyaan swararat bhi uccharit hoti hai evam swardhvani ke samaan akshar nirmaan main sahaayak siddh hoti hai
 Akshar word is used in Hindi for English Syllable
 dow ramvilas sharma ne silabal ke liye 'swarik' shabd kaa prayog kiya he
 
 chunki akshar shabd kaa bhashaa or vyakaran ke itihaas main anek arthchhaya ke liye prayog kiya gaya he, isliye silabal ke arth main iske prayog se bhramasrijan kii ashanka rahati he
 In the pronunciation of a word, the sound which has peak or height is the same letter or syllable, as on the sound in the hand
 is shabd main ek akshar he
 The word 'unimaginative' has three letters - A, Kal, Pit; Three - come to freedom; That is, where there is a separation of the pronunciation of the vowel in the word, there is a separation of the letter
 dhwani utpaadan kii drushti se vichaar karne par phuffus sanchalan kii ikai ko akshar yaa swarik kehete hai, jisamen ek hi sheershadhvani hoti he
 From the point of view of anatomy, the letter or vocal can also be called pleural pulsation, which is pronounced in the sound system
 jab dhwani khand yaa alpatam dhwani samooh ke uccharan ke samay avyav sanchalan akshar main ucchtam ho to vah dhwani aksharvat hoti he
 Vowel sounds are often pronounced syllable and consonant sounds are pronounced
 shabdagat uccharan kii nitant pruthak ikai ko akshar kaha jaataa he, yatha The number of letters in a word does not depend on how many sounds it contains, but rather on how much shock or shock the word is pronounced, ie how many disjoint sound units are in the word
