 During his time, the Nath and Mahanubhav sects were promoted in Maharashtra
 r Saint Shiromani Sri Namdevji was born at sunrise on "kartik Shukla Ekadashi Samvat 1327, Sunday" on October 26, 1270, in "pandharpur", Marathwada, Maharashtra
 maharashtra ke satara jile main krishna nadi ke kinare basaa "narsi bamani gaanv, jila parabhani unka paitruk gaanv he
" sant shiromani shri namdev ji kaa janm "shimpi", jise rajasthan main "chhipa" bhi kehete he, parivaar main hua tha
 His father's name was Damasheth and mother's name was Gonai
 inkaa parivaar bhagwaan vitthal kaa param bhakt tha
 Namdevji was married to Kalyan resident Rajai and had four sons and daughters-in-law namely "narayana - Ladabai", "vitthal - Godabai", "mahadev - Yesabai", and "govind - Sakrabai" and a daughter named Limbabai
 shri namdev ji kii badi bahan kaa naam aaubai tha
 One of his grandchildren was named Mukund and his maid was "sant Janabai", who lived at the house of Damasheth even before the birth of Sant Namdevji
 sant shiromani shri namdevji ke nanaaji kaa naam gomaji or naniji kaa naam umabai tha
 Saint Namdevji accepted Visoba Khecher as Guru
 visoba khechar kaa janm sthaan paithan tha, jo pangarpur se pachaas kos dur "ondhya nagnath" naamak pracheen shiv kshetra main hai
 In this temple, he taught Saint Shiromani Shri Namdevji and made him his disciple
 sant namdev, sant gyaneshwar ke samakaleen the or umr main unase 5 saal bade the
 Sant Namdev, Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Nivrithinath, Sant Sopanadev along with his sister Bahub Muktabai and other contemporary saints traveled all over Maharashtra with North India and composed "abhang" and taught Janata Janardhana the lesson of Samata and Prabhu-bhakti
 sant gyaneshwar ke paralokagaman ke baad duusare saathi santon ke saath inhone puure bharat kaa bhraman kiya
 He wrote compositions in Marathi as well as Hindi
 inhone atharah varsho tak punjab main bhagavannam kaa prachaar kiya
 Some of his compositions are still found in the Sikh religious book "guru Granth Sahib"
 isamen sant namdevji ke 61pad sangrahit hai
 Even today his composed abhangas are sung with devotion and love all over Maharashtra
 ye samvath 1407 main samadhi main leen ho gaye
 During the time of Sant Namdevji, Nath and Mahanubhav sects were promoted in Maharashtra
 nath panth "alakh niranjan" kii yogaparak sadhana kaa samarthak tathaa bahyadambaron kaa virdohi tha or mahanubhav panth vaidic karmkand tathaa bahudevopasana kaa virdohi hote hue bhi murtipuja ko sarvatha nishiddh nahin maanata tha
 Apart from these, the worship of "vithoba" of Pandharpur was also prevalent in Maharashtra
 sant namdevji pangarpur main vaari pratha shuru karwaane ke janak hai
 Under this practice, even today, the general public used to do Ashari and Kartiki Ekadashi every year as "vari" of Pandharpur for their darshans, such wari is called "varkari"
 vitalopasna kaa yah "panth" "warkari" sampradaay kehalaata he
 Shri Namdev is considered the chief saint of this sect
 warkari sant namdev ke samay ke sambandh main vidwaanon main matbhed he
 The reason for the differences is that there have been five saints named Namdev in Maharashtra and they all have done a little "abhang" and composition
 aavate kii "sakal santagatha" main namdev ke naam par 2500 abhang milte hai
 Of the nearly 600 abhangas, there is only the imprint of Namdev or "nama" and in the remaining "vishnudasanama"
 namdev ji kaa janm 26 oktober 1270, ravivaar main pratham sanvatsar, samvath 1327, karthik shukla ekadshi ko pangarpur main hua tha
 Namdevji was born in Pandharpur near Dama Sheth "shimpi", a native of a village called Narsi Brahmani, also known as "chhipa" in Rajasthan

 Those who saw God in the idol of Namdev Pandharpur's "vitthal" started to experience Khecher everywhere after coming in contact with him
 unako premabhakti main gyaan kaa samavesh ho gaya
 Dr
 Mohan Singh calls "namdev" a disciple of Ramanand
 parantu maharashtra main inaki bahumanya guru parampara is prakaar he -gyaneshwar ji or namdev ji ne uttar bharat kii saath-saath yatra kii thi
 Dnyaneshwar went to a place called Kolayat in Marwar with Namdev Ji
 vahaan se lautakar gyaneshwarji ne "aalandi" main shake 1218 main samadhi le lee
 With the disconnection of Dnyaneshwar, Namdevji's mind was moved from Maharashtra and he went towards Punjab
 gurudaspur jile ke "ghumaan" naamak sthaan par aaj bhi namdev ji kaa mandir vidyaman he
 There is also a "cult" going on in a limited area
 santon ke jivan ke saath katipay chamatkaari ghatnaayen judi rahati he
 In the character of Namdev too, by order of the Sultan, his dead cow should be kept alive, after the Pujari's objection to the Kirtan in front of the Lord Jagmohanji temple in front of him, the westward gate of his door is turned towards the west, incident in Marwar in Pali district of Rajasthan
 There is also an account of the incident of the mythical temple of Lord Krishna, locally called Lord Jagmohanji, in a village called "barsa" near Lets iskaa ullekh "hansanirvaani sant mohananandji maharaj" dwaara apane hastlikhit pustak main kiya hai, jis par shodh kar paali ke "gudaayendala gaanv" nivasee ""shri ashok aar

 According to the Maharashtrian saint tradition, he had devotion to Nirgun, in which there was no discrimination of virtuous Nirguna
 unhone marathi main kai sau abhang or hindi main sau ke lagbhag pad rache hai
 His designations include both the kundalini-yoga-sadhana of Hatha Yoga and the "talabeli" of Premabhakti
 nirguni kabir ke samaan namdev main bhi vrath, tirth aadi bahyadambar ke prati upeksha tathaa bhagavannam evam satguru ke prati aadar bhav vidyaman he
 In the footsteps of Kabir, the expression of the name yatra-tatra is visible

 You campaigned in the South a lot
 aapke saathi sant gyaneshwar ji paralok gaman kar gaye to aap bhi kuch uparam rahane lag gaye
 In the last days of his life, Shri Namdevji again came to Pandharpur and on Saturday, July 3, 1350, he attained salvation by taking the family "sanjeevan Samadhi"
 aaj bhi unke bhakt is din ko "shri namdev samadhi diwas" ke rup main yaad karke apane ko dhanya samajhate he
 He also took samadhi in the stairs leading to the temple of Sri Vitthal Bhagavan
 unki antim ichha bhi yahi thi kii shri hari vitthal ke darshanath jo bhi bhakt mandir main pravesh kare tab unki raj kan mere maathe par pade or wo shri vitthal ke darshan kare 
 aaj bhi wo sthaan "shri namdev pyri" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The bani pronounced by Namdev ji is also found in Gurugranth Sahib
 bahut sari vaani dakshin va maharashtra main gaai jaati he
 Reading your speech brings peace to the mind and leads to devotion
 ek din namdev ji ke pita kisi kaam se baahar ja rahe the
 He told Namdev ji that now he will serve Thakur in his place like giving bath to Thakur, keeping the temple clean and offering milk to Thakur
 jaise sari maryaada main purna karata hoon vaise tum bhi karnaa
 Don't see carelessness or laziness otherwise Thakur ji will get angry
 namdev ji ne vaisaa hi kiya jaise pitaaji samajhakar gaye the
 When he filled the bowl of milk and placed it before Thakur ji and sat with folded hands and kept watching how Thakur ji drinks milk
 Where did Thakur drink milk? He was a stone idol
 namdev ko is baat kaa pataa nahin tha ki thakur ko chammach bharkar doodh lagaaya jaataa va shesh doodh pandit pi jate the
 They started praying, Lord! i am your small servant, i have brought milk and please accept it
 bhakt ne apni bechaini is prakaar pragat kii - Oh God! i have brought this milk from the Kapla cow
 he mere gobind! yadi aap doodh pi lenge to meraa man shant ho jayega nahin to pitaaji naaraaz honge
 i have put a bowl of gold before you
 pie! avashya pie! maine koi paap nahin kiya
 If you drink milk daily from my father, then why are you not taking it from me? Oh God! Have mercy pitaaji mujhe pehle hi bura va nikamma samajhate hai
 If you did not drink milk today, i am not well
 pitaaji mujhe ghar se baahar nikaal denge
 The task that Namdev's father could not do his whole life was done by Namdev
 us maasoom bachche ko pandito kii baimani kaa pataa nahin tha
 He kept praying to Thakur ji
 ant main prabhu bhakt kii bhakthi par khinche hue aa gaye
 Laughed by the stone statue
 namdev ne iskaa zikr is prakaar kiya he - a devotee settled in the heart of the Lord
 namdev ko dekhakar prabhu hans pade
 Laughing, he moved both hands and drank milk
 doodh pikar murti phir waisi hi ho gai
 Namdev ji went home after feeding milk
 is prakaar prabhu ne unako saakshaat darshan die
 This was Namdev's first victory on the path of devotion
 shuddh hryday se kii hui prarthana se unke paas shaktiyaan aa gai
 He became a person of devotion and the words that came out of his mouth would be true
 jab aapke pitaaji ko yah gyaan hua ki aapane thakur main jaan daal di va doodh pilaayaa to vah bahut prasann hue
 He thought his total had become successful

 In this very young age, Guleri ji had acquired knowledge of Sanskrit Prakrit Bangla Marathi, in addition to Hindi and English, not only German and French languages, but also through study and self-study

 This detailed patbhumi was the main hand in forging his interest and thinking and its introduction is found to be equal in the content of his writing and his approach
 pan
 chandradhar sharma guleri ke saath ek bahut badi vidmbana yah he ki unke adhyayan, gyaan or ruchi kaa kshetra haalaanki behad vistrut tha or unki pratibha kaa prasar bhi anek kritiyon, krithirupon or vidhaon main hua tha, kintu aam hindi pathak hi nahin, vidwaanon kaa ek bada varg bhi unhen amar kahani ‘usne kaha tha’ ke rachanaakaar ke rup main hi pahachaanata he
 The dazzling chore of this story has taken the rest of his diversified powerful world as if it were
 unke prabal prashansak or prakhar aalochak bhi amuman isi kahani ko lekar ulajhate rahe hai
 His scholarship related to subjects related to ancient literature, culture, Hindi language, contemporary society, politics, etc
 has been mentioned occasionally, but except for the mention of two terms like 'tortoise Dharam' and 'maresi Mohi Kuthaun' and an article like Old Hindi
 The hallmark of that scholarship has hardly reached the common reader
 vyapak hindi samaaj unki prakand vidwata or sarjanaatmak pratibha se lagbhag anjaan he
 During his brief life span of 39 years, Guleri ji did not compose any independent text but wrote a lot in retail form, wrote on countless topics and incorporating the features and forms of many genres
 unke lekhan kaa ek bada hissaa jahaan vishuddh academik athwa shodhaparak he, unki shastrajyata tathaa panditya kaa parichaayak he; vahiin, usase bhi bada hissaa unke khule dimag, maanavtaavaadi drushti or samakaleen samaaj, dharm raajnneeti aadi se gahan sarokaar kaa parichay detaa he
 This concern from the public is visible even in his academic like 'old Hindi' and research works like 'maharishi Chyavan's Ramayana'
 in baton ke atirikt guleri ji ke vichaaron kii aadhuniktaa bhi hamase aaj unke puravishkaar kii maang karti he
 Given the life span of only 39 years, the magnitude of Guleri's writings and the diversity of his subject matter and disciplines is truly awe-inspiring
 unki rachanaaon main kahaniyaan kathaayen, aakhyaan, lalit nibandh, gambheer vishyon par vivechanaatmak nibandh, shodhpatr, samikshaayen, sampadakeey tippaniyan, patr vidha main likhi tippaniyan, samakaleen sahitya, samaaj, raajnneeti, dharm, vigyaan, kala aadi par lekh tathaa vaktavy, vaidic / puranic sahitya, puraatatva, bhashaa aadi par prabandh, lekh tathaa tippaniyan-sabhi shaamil hai
 From the point of view of the generality of the subject, Guleri's writings cover all the serious subjects like religion, archeology, history and philology and light subjects like Kashi's sleep
 vishyon kaa itnaa vaividhya lekhak ke adhyayan, abhiruchi or gyaan ke vistaar kii gavaahi detaa he, to har vishay par itani gaharaai se samakaleen pariprekshya main vichaar apane samay or nae vichaaron ke prati uski sajagata ko rekhaankit karata he
 Born in a family of Raj astrologers, duly initiated in all the rituals of Hinduism, this stereotypical reality may not match the image of the Tripundhari devout Brahmin, but it is natural for him to raise his voice against the regressive tendencies in the era of socio-political-literary excitement

 Along with the refutation, they also adorn the right and the appropriate
 kintu dharm, samaaj, raajnneeti or sahitya main unhen jahaan kahin bhi pakhand yaa anauchity nazar aata he, us par ve jamkar prahaar karte hai
 His ideological transparency, depth and foresight in this sequence are proved by the fact that most of the issues raised by him and his criticism are relevant even today
 unke lekhan kii rochakata uski praasangikta ke atirikt uski prastuti kii anokhi bhangima main bhi nihit he
 Like many other essayists of that era, in the writings of Guleri ji, fun and sense of humor flow continuously in one end
 dharmasiddhanth, aadhyatm aadi jaise kuch ek gambheer vishyon ko chhodkar lagbhag har vishay ke lekhan main yah vinod bhav prasangon ke chunaav main bhashaa ke muhaavaron main uddharanon or uktiyon main baraabar zankrut rahata he
 Where criticism is more penetrating, this humor turns into satire - as in articles related to education, social, stereotypes and politics, Guleri ji's works sometimes tickle, sometimes shrug and keep the reader's interest occupied
 guleri ji kii style mukhyatah vaartalap kii style he jahaan ve kissabayani ke lahaze main maano sidhe pathak se mukhaatib hote hai
 It was a period of decorating the dialect as a literary language
 atah shabdaawalee or prayogon ke str par samrasya or parimarjan kii kahin-kahin kami bhi nazar aati he
 Somewhere they use obsolete Sanskrit words like 'pagrishni', 'krishti' and 'agamighra', while elsewhere they use the typical lingua franca words like 'ber', 'bichhoda' and 'pant'
 angrezi arabi-farsi aadi ke shabd hi nahin puure-ke-puure muhaavarey bhi unke lekhan main tatsam yaa anudit rup main chale aate hai
 But this mixed form of language and tone of conversation has brought an informality and intimacy in his writing
 haan guleri ji apane lekhan main uddhran or udhaaharan bahut dete hai
 These quotes and examples usually make their narrative more clear and interesting, but in many places it also demands from the reader the knowledge of the background and context of the example, so much knowledge of ancient Indian poetry, Western literature, history etc
 from the common reader
 It is wrong to expect
 isliye yah atirikt ‘prasanggarbhatv’ unke lekhan ke sahaj rasaswad main kahin-kahin avashya hi baadhak hota he
 However, whatever the shortcomings in Guleriji's expression, his positive contribution in the development of Hindi language and vocabulary cannot be ignored
 ve khadi boli kaa prayog anek vishyon or anek prasangon main kar rahe the-shaayad kisi bhi anya samakaleen vidwaan se kahin badhkar
 Literature mythology, history, science, linguistics, archeology, religion, philosophy, politics, sociology, etc
 The subjects of their language were naturally creating scope for many applications and genres
 vah vibhinn vishyon ko abhivyakt karne main hindi kii sakshmata kaa jivant pramaan he
 In every context, their language remains intimate and alive, even if it becomes more complex or more light at some places
 guleri ji kii bhashaa or style unke vichaaron kii abhivyakti kaa madhyam maatr nahin thi
 It is an authentic document of a prudent mind standing on the era and also the mindset of that era
 isi ore ingit karte hue pro namvar singh kaa bhi kahana he, ‘‘guleri ji hindi main sirf ek nayaa gadhy yaa nayi style nahin garh rahe the balki ve vastutah ek nayi chetana kaa nirmaan kar rahe the or yah nayaa gadhy nayi chetana kaa sarjanaatmak saadhan he
 '' apane or aadhuniktaa’ samakaleen saamaajik, raajnneetik or dharmik sthitiyon se unke gambheer judaav or inase sambaddh unke chintan tathaa pratikriyaaon main spasht hoti he
 His concern was not only with the linguistic and literary movements of his time, but from every side of the life of that era
 kisi bhi prasang main jo sthiti unke maanas ko aakarshith yaa uttejit karti thi, us par tippanee kiye bagaiyr ve rah nahin pate the
 These comments testify to his concerns, sharpness and openness of vision
 anek prasangon main galleri ji apane samay se itnaa aage the ki unki tippaniyan aaj bhi hamen apane chaaron ore dekhne or sochane ko majboor karti hai
 In the era of recognition of 'khogege hoge hoge badge', Guleri ji considered sports as a strong medium of education
 bal-vivaah ke virodh or stri-shiksha ke samarthan ke saath hi aaj se sau saal pehle unhone balak-balikaon ke swasth charitrik vikaas ke liye sahashiksha ko aavashyak mana tha
 All these today we may find interesting facts of history to the urban people, but in the context of the entire country, in the atmosphere of illiteracy and superstition spread here, the words of Guleri ji are still relevant and relevant
 bharatvasiyon kii kamazoriyaan kaa ve lagaataar zikr karte rahete hai-visheshkar saamaajik raajnneetik sandarbhon main
 One reason for our degeneration is mutual disruption - "this continent is a box of cats running to bite each other"
 The caste-system is also our biggest weakness
 guleri ji sabase man kii sankeernata tyagkar us bhavy karmkshetra main aane kaa aahvaan karte hai jahaan saamaajik jati bhed nahin, maansik jati bhed nahin or jahaan jati bhed he to kaary vyavastha ke hit 
 They consider untouchability against Sanatan Dharma
 arthhin karmkandon or jyotish se jude andhvishwaason kaa ve jagah-jagah zordaar khandan karte hai
 They consider only religious religion as external religion and do not associate religion with rituals and connect it with history and sociology
 dharm kaa arth unke liye ‘‘saarvajanik pritibhav he’’ ‘‘jo sampradayik irshyaa-dwesh ko bura maanata he’’ 
 According to him, liberality, harmony and humanism are the essence of religion and it is very important to recognize this fact - "nowadays, it is necessary to have a liberal religion that will be practiced by Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Muslims, Krishans in one sense and in this sense of fraternity
 Generate, but narrow religious education 


 will widen the gap between us
 ’’ 
 Guleri ji was not connected to religion with equal rituals, but with ethics, public welfare and public service

 The biggest reason for this is the interest of Delhiites towards food
 dilli bharat kaa dil he isliye bharat ke har hisse ke lajij vyanjan yahaan sulabh hai
 But this hobby of Delhiites is not limited to Punjabi, Gujarati or South Indian
 unhen tarah-tarah ke khaane kaa itnaa shauk he ki duniyabar kii international food chence ko dilli ek bade bazaar ke rup main najar aa rahaa he
 Chinese, Continental, Mexican and Italian food are now found in almost every part of Delhi
 dilli kaa swaad ab dhire-dhire global ho rahaa he
 Labanese, Japanese, Thai and Russian food are also now included in the realm of 'taste of Delhi'
 chinis food se dilli kaa parichay saalon purana ho chukaa he
 However, it is a different matter that we have changed Chinese food a lot according to our taste
 masalan theth chinis khaanaa bahut masaaledaar or tikhaa hota he
 Pasta and Pizza for Delhiites Now where are the Italian left? This food made in olive oil is very liked for its taste and aroma
 continental Continental food is made using less oil and spices
 isaki ek or khaasiyat he ki ise bahut zyada pakaaya nahin jaataa
 Due to the use of coconut and chilli, Thai food is very similar to South Indian food
 khushboo ke liye isamen masaalon kaa kaaphi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The use of tomatoes and onions makes it much like our food
 iske alaava mexican food main shaakaahaari vyanjanon kii bhi kaaphi varaity hai
 However, it is very spicy and contains a lot of calories
 chinis se kaaphi samanta rakhane vaale is food main mirch-masaalon kaa istemaal kam hota he
 For example, boiled rice, pickles, soups, vegetables and fish are eaten in a typical Japanese home
 dilli ke liye yah khaanaa abhi nayaa he, lekin bhartiya khaane se kaaphi miltaa julata he
 The main use of dry fruits in this is its special feature
 china hi nahin, food ke jariye dilli duniya ke kai duusare deshon ke bhi kareeb ai he
 The result of this close is that Delhi is also full of specialty restaurants
 al arab, dam pukht, kashmiri food ke liye chor bijair, thai food ke liye baan thai or sukothai, jaipanij food ke liye tokio, mexican food ke liye rodeo 


 list lambii he
 Overall, today Delhiites have adopted global food culture in the true sense by dropping every wall of regionalism in terms of food and drink

 Different historians seem to consider the period of industrial revolution differently, while some historians are not ready to accept it as a revolution

 This ideology spread throughout Europe in the late 18th century

 In this way, this cooperation of trade and military in economic and political fields helped in strengthening the foundation of colonialism
 rajyon ke bich, apane deshon kii vyapaaraniti ko protsaahan dene ke prayaas main, upniveshon ke liye yuddh bhi hue
 The economic life of the colonies became the fulfillment of the industrial needs of the "original nation"
 swatantra astitv ke sthaan par paravalamban unki visheshta ban gai
 In countries where industrial changes took place, they were freed from human bonds, they could go to new places in search of new businesses, they could produce more wealth
 kintu is viksit sampatti kaa shrey kisi ho or usak pratifal koun praapt kare, ye prashn uthne lage
 How much work, when and at what salary, should the workers handling the machines operating 24 hours, these questions started to be considered from the point of view of humanity

 The worldwide market was born by new means of transport

 As other countries and colonies of the world moved forward independently, the effects of this revolution slowly began to be seen

 These nations, after becoming independent, are trying to get limited and capital support from other rich nations, but they do not want to get into any political bond in return for such assistance
 in rashtron kaa moolbhoot uddeshy apane yahan usee prakaar ke parivartan karnaa he jaise parivartan audyogic kranti ke saath europe main hue
 But it is clear that basically these new nations have to develop the means to obtain raw materials for themselves and to sell the finished goods according to their limits

 There was a huge increase in wealth

 The expansion of colonial imperialism was also the result of industrial revolution and new classes emerged

 Human confidence is enhanced by maximum exploitation and use of natural resources and ability to exercise authority over nature

 are prominent

 bhartiya kaarigaron dwaara niryaat maal arab, misr, rome, france tathaa england ke bazaaron main bikta tha or bharatvarsh se vyapaar karne ke liye videshi rashtron main hode si lagi rahati thi
 The East India Company was founded in England in 1600 with this aim
 yah company bharat main bana hua maal england le jaakar bechati thi
 Indian goods, especially fabrics made of silk and velvet, were much preferred in England; Even the Queen of England considered her pride in wearing Indian clothes
 parantu yah sthiti bahut dinon tak bani na rah saki
 As a result of the Industrial Revolution, goods began to be mass produced in England and sold in the colonies

 Indian artisans were weak and scattered; Hence they were unable to compete with machine made items
 falat: unhen apana pushtaini pesha chhodkar kheti kaa sahaara lenaa padaa
 Thus, the industrial revolution resulted in the destruction of Indian business and millions of artisans started starving
 audyogic kranti, jo england ke liye vardaan swaroop thi, bhartiya udyogon ke liye abhishaap siddh hui
 Modernization of India began in 1850 AD
 san 1853-54 main bharat main rail or taar kii pranali prarambh hui

 Sugar factories were also established in 1932 AD and in 1935-36 AD they started to meet the 95 percent requirements of the country

 Fidel Castro's armed rebellion against Cuban President Falgensio Batista on July 26 is called the Cuban Revolution
 july 1953 main armbh hua yah viplav 1 janvari 1959 ko samaapt hua jab cuba kii sarkaar apdasth karke krantikari samaajawaadee rajya kii sthapana hui
 This movement followed the communist path in the following years and in October 1965 became the Communist Party
 vartmaan samay main samyavaadee dal ke netaa kestro ke bhai raul hai
 The Cuban armed revolution that took place in the last year of the fifties is known as the victory of the nexus of nationalism and Marxism over American imperialism
 is kranti kaa netritv fidel kastro ke sanghathan ‘26 july movement’ ke haathon main tha
 a person like Che Guevara who inspired the leftist youth of the world was the result of this revolution
 1 janvari, 1959 ko kranti kii safalataa ke kaaran cuba ke taanashaah phulgensiyon batista ko desh chhod kar bhaag janaa padaa, or yuva chhapamar yoddhaon ne satta par adhikaar kar liya

 Communist rule in Cuba continues to this day, despite the collapse of the socialist camp all over the world in the nineties
 cuba kii kranti kaa mul uske aupniveshik ateet main nihit he
 Most countries in Latin America gained independence from Spanish colonialism between 1810–25
 lekin cuba 1898 tak spani upnivesh bana rahaa
 In this way, it was the last free country in the American continent
 antat ise jose maarti ke netritv main hue duusare swatantraaa sangram main azaadi to hasil hui, lekin swatantraaa senaniyon kaa satta par kabza nahin hua
 Cuba was strategically important to the United States

 Therefore, America took an open interest in the politics here and supported the rulers who were ready to serve their interests
 is prakriya main cuba kii sthiti aisi ho gayi jaise ek aupniveshik shaasha kii jagah doosraa aupniveshik shaasha aa gaya ho
 The result of this development was that Cuba's national liberation movement became a struggle against American influence and control
 1933 ke andolan ko cuba kii kranti ke vikaas ke agle adhyay ke rup main dekha janaa chahie
 This indicated a new phase in the freedom struggle
 sabase mahatvapurn baat yah he ki is andolan ne khud ko shramik varg ke sanghathan or samaajawaadee parampara ke sandarbh main paribhaashit kiya
 This movement led to a progressive government in Cuba for some time
 lekin iske thode hi samay baad satta batista ke haath main aa gayi jisane phir se cuba ko america aarthik or raajnneetik hiton se jod diya
 Indeed, Batista and his movement played an important role in ending the dictatorship of Jaredo Macado in Cuba
 1933 main vah sena kaa pramukh tha
 He had effective control over the five-member Presidency governing Cuba at that time
 1940 tak dikhaawati raashtrapatiyon par niyantran rakhane vaala batista isi varsh khud raashtrapati ban gaya
 He implemented the new constitution in Cuba
 vah apane samay ke hisaab se pragatisheel tha
 After completing his term as President in 1944, he went to America and came back in 1952 and contested the President
 chunaavon main haarane ke baad batista ne sena kii madad se takhtapalat karke 1952 main apni taanaashaahee kaayam kar lee
 However, after the events of 1933, streams of nationalist politics began to emerge
 ek ore artodox the jo maarti kii parampara par jor dete the
 On the other hand, there was Diario Revolutionsenario who was influenced by Antonio Guterres, the leader of the 1933 movement
 ye damankaaree rajya ke khilaaf hinsak karrwai par jor dete the
 Fidel Castro was also influenced by this idea, but Marti's combative personality was also heavily influenced by him
 1933 ke baad ke daur main cuba kii communist party, jisaki sthapana 1925 main hui thi, soviet sangh ke prabhaav main apni kaaryadisha badalati rahi
 After 1935 she started collaborating with Batista
 isliye krantikari rashtrawaad par vishwaas karne vaale fidel kastro jaise yuvak communiston ko andeh kii nigaah se dekhne lage
 On the other hand, the communists also criticized the radical nationalists on the ground that they were trying to organize people in the name of nationalism instead of class-based analysis
 1952 ke baad kranti kii aguaayi ke liye diarectorio or kastro ke bich netritv ke liye hode shuru ho gayi jo aage bhi chalati rahi
 But the similarity between the two was that both of them considered the 1933 conflicts as their foundation
 26 july, 1953 main artodoxo samooh ke yuvakon ne sena par hamalaa kiya
 The group also included Fidel Castro
 yah hamalaa behad prabhaavshaalee tha or isamen batista kii sena ke bahut se jawan maare gayi
 But as a result, Castro and the rest of the rebels also fell
 batista ne pakade gayi vidrohiyon main se kai ko bahut pratadit kiya or bahuton ko maut kii sajaa bhi sunaayi gayi
 Castro himself was also prosecuted and sentenced to 15 years
 mukademe ke dauraan kastro dwaara apane bachaav main di gayi daleelon kaa aitihaasik mahatva he
 He attacked corruption spreading in the country and insisted on re-enacting the liberal constitution of 1940
 kastro ne chote kisaanon ko jameen kaa patta dene, videshi swaamitv vaali badi sampattiyon ke rashtriyakaran or duusare deshon ke logon ke swaamitv vaale kaarakaanon main mazdooron ko phayda dene jaise kaaryakramon kii maang kii
 Apart from this, Castro also stressed on nationalization of public services, reduction in rent and improvement in education
 is tarah kastro ne kranti ke baad ke cuba kii tasviir pesh kii
 The treatment of Fidel Castro and other rebel leaders also increased public outrage
 iske virodh main hue virodh pradarshnon ke kaaran july, 1955 main emnesti lau kaa istemaal karke kastro ko jail se reeha kar diya gaya
 Castro left the country and moved to Mexico six weeks later, but he promised he would return to pursue his struggle
 kastro ke videsh jane ke baad bhi unke dwaara banaaya gaya sanghathan sakriy rahaa jise 26 july movement ke naam se janaa gaya
 Castro's goal was clear
 ve naye sashastr vidrohiyon kii sena taiyaar karnaa chaahate the
 He was confident that the action of the revolutionaries would lead to mass rebellion
 isi najariye ke tahat mexico main fidel kastro ne apane hathiyaarband gorilla daste taiyaar karne kii koshish kii
 Apart from this, they also tried to form political alliances
 yaheen unki mulaakaat ek yuva danta-chikitsak arnesto che guyavara se hui
 Both agreed on the concept of revolution by guerrilla warfare
 donon ko hi spanish yuddh ke varisht yoddha alberto baio ne mexico main chalco ke ek farm main prashikshit kiya
 Castro and Che planned to return to Cuba in December 1956 with 82 guerrilla fighters from Motor Visions Granma
 lekin jab 3 disambar, 1956 ko ve cuba ke tat par pahunche to inhen batista ke sainikon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 j-26-m's urban areas had come to help him, but they left waiting because Castro's guerrillas had arrived rather late on a fixed date
 batista ke sainikon ke hamale main adhikansh gorilla ladaake maare gayi
 But Fidel, Che and Fidel's younger brother Raul Castro survived the attack
 takreeban 15 dinon ke baad ghayal avasthaa main ye log siyera mestara ke jangalon main ek-duusare se mili
 He contacted J-26-M in the city and started gathering guerrilla fighters in the jungles
 lekin yahan ke garib kisaanon ko prashikshit krantikari bananaa bahut mushkil tha
 The peasants were ready to leave the work of revolution and go back to farming
 yaa virdohi khemaa unhen paise aadi kaa laalach dekar apane paksh main khinch saktaa the
 For Che Guevara this was a matter of greater concern
 isliye unhone sakht anushaasan tathaa anushaasan todane vaale ko sakht sajaa dene par bal diya
 On the other hand, a problem was that the urban leadership of another revolutionary organization working in Cuba, such as the Directoire and the 26 July Movement, did not fully agree with Castro and Che's guerrilla plans
 cuba communist party bhi inaki aalochak thi
 Even Che and Fidel differed on communist goals
 che kaa zyada jor marxvad kii ore tha, jabaki kastro par cubai rashtrawaad kaa gaharaa prabhaav tha
 Nonetheless, the Castro Khema gradually gained influence over the J-26-M, and Frank Pius, the leader of the urban contingent of the party, was assassinated on July 30, 1957
 april 1958 main kastro ne apane dal kii ore se purna yuddh ghoshnaa-patr jari kiya
 In this, he called upon the people to go on a general strike in April 1958
 yadhyapi yah hadtaal bahut safal nahin rahi, lekin isane batista ke kilaaf virodh ko or zyaada badhaayaa
 This prompted Castro to seek closer cooperation with other groups
 20 july ko unhone ekta ghoshnaa-patr jari kiya
 It was signed by eight organizations, including Directo and JM-26
 lekin cuba kii communist party ne isamen shaamil nahin hui
 However, this manifesto was also evidence of Batista's opposition being united
 isamen loktantric or sanvaidhanik adhikaron ko kaayam karne kii puri yojana pesh kii gayi
 This manifesto was also a proof that the other rebel groups had begun to accept the leadership of Fidel Castro
 dhire-dhire batista kii satta par pakad bhi kamazor hoti gayi
 To gain legitimacy in November, the Batista regime conducted elections to show off
 in chunaavon main bade paimaane par dhaandhli hui, isliye iske nateezon ko koi vaidhata nahin mili
 The growing confrontation between Batista and rebel groups reached a peak in December
 disambar, 1958 main kastro ke sahyogi che ne centa kalra shahar main 350 chhapamaron ke saath batista ke chaar hazaar gardon ko teen din kii ladaai ke baad haraa diya
 In this, Che, showing tactical skill, stopped the train from coming into the city with weapons for the guards
 sarkari sena haar gayi
 Three days later, on 31 December 1958, Batista fled the country
 beesvin sadi ke itihaas main cuba kii kranti kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he
 This showed how young fighters could change power through guerrilla guerrilla warfare
 america ke virodh ke baavjood krantikari safal hue
 America made a lot of efforts after the revolution, but it could not end Fidel's rule and influence in Cuba
 amuman cuba kii kranti main fidel, che or unke dal 26-em july ke yogadan par hi bal diya jaataa he
 But other groups within Cuba, for example, the Directorates, also played an important role in this
 fidel kastro or unka dal krantikari rashtrawaad dwaara pragatisheel samaajawaadee lakshyon ko hasil karnaa chahta tha
 But in this revolution and the system that came after it, democratic freedoms and values were not given any preference
