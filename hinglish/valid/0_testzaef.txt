 The lump sum payment policy is a contractual life insurance that is designed to pay the lump sum to the customer after a certain time period or upon premature death
 Ideally this time period is ten, fifteen or up to 20 years for a certain age range
 kuch policy aisi bhi hoti hai jo ghaatak bimariyon ke hone par bhi bhugtan kar detii hai
 All these policies are generally traditionally profit or unit-linked
 ekamusth raashi kaa bhugtan zaldi bhi praapt kiya ja saktaa he aise main policydharak ko vah sarender mulya praapt hota he jo beemaa company dwaara is aadhaar par nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he ki vah policy kitne dinon se chal rahi he or isamen ab tak kul kitna bhugtan kiya ja chukaa he
 Under this, the customer is promised a certain amount of payment called the sum assured and it can be increased by a combination of periodic benefits based on investment performance
 nishchit avadhi kii samaapti par niyamit laabh milanaa sunishchit hota he or ant main ek anya gaiyr-pratyaabhoot laabh bhi diya ja saktaa he jise terminal bonus ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Under adverse investment conditions, the encashment value or surrender value can be reduced to a 'market value depreciation' or MVR
 Such a measure is used to protect investors who wish to remain in the fund rather than those who wish to withdraw their money with little profit in the event of the stock market going down and while doing so they risk They do not even take into account the security of If an MVA has to be paid before the expiry of the period, then that payment is deducted based on the policies adopted by the then fund manager
 purv main nimna sarender mulya dene or kisi graahak dwaara bhugtan kar paane main asamarth hone ke dauraan nimna str kii riyaayat dene ke liye ekamusth bhugtan policy kii aalochana kii ja chuki he
 This policy was in contrast to the mortgage lending system that allows for some degree of concession under such circumstances, so as a result of redundancy etc
, life insurance companies often adopt a plan of 'payment' when the premium is not paid carefully
 Huh
 unit-linkd ekamusth bhugtan aise nivesh hai jahaan premium ko ekikrut beemaa fund kii ikaiyon main nivesh kar diya jaataa he
 Units are redeemed to cover the cost of life insurance
 policydharak praayah yah chun sakate hai ki unka premium kis fund main or kis anupaat main nivesh kiya ja rahaa he
 Unit prices are published regularly and the price received on redeeming the policy is equal to the present value of the units
 yah isaki sabase saral paribhaasha he
 Full lump sum payments fall in the category of lump sum payments with benefits, where the original sum assured is equal to the death benefit received at the start of the policy, and the amount eventually paid is greater than the sum assured at the time of the increase
 ek kam laagat vaala ekamusth bhugtan nimna ghatakon kaa sangyojan hota he: ek aisa ekamusth bhugtan jahaan bhavishya kii anumaanit vruddhi dar ek nirdhaarit raashi or ek ghatate hue jivan beemaa ghatak tak pahunchati he jisase yah sunishchit kiya ja sake ki mrityu ho jane kii avasthaa main nirdhaarit raashi kaa bhugtan nunatam raashi ke rup main kiya jaayegaa
 The main purpose of low cost lump sum payments has been to pay interest in lump sum loan payments, complete with the required premium only at the end of the policy term or before the policyholder dies
 The lump sum payment will be more than this
 prachlit ekamusth bhugtan niyam yaa duusare se lee gayi ekamusth bhugtan policy, paaramparik laabh yukt ekamusth bhugtan hai jo ek nae swami ko apni samyavadhi ke bich hi bech die gayi hai
 TEP markets motivate buyers to purchase an unanticipated lump sum payment policy at a surrender value higher than the price offered by the insurance company
 Investors will pay more than the surrender value because instead of ending the policy prematurely, the price increases by continuing it
 jab ek policy bechi jaati he, to uske sabhi laabh sambandhi adhikaar uske nae swami ke paas sthanantarit ho jate hai
 The new owner of the policy takes responsibility for paying future premiums and gets the maturity value when the policy expires or upon the death of the policyholder
 ve policydharak jo apni policy bech dete hai, unhen policy bechene ke baad jivan beemaa kaa koi laabh nahin miltaa or isane baad unhen yah vichaar karnaa chahie ki kya ve koi vaikalpik beemaa lenaa chaahate hai
 TEP markets operate exclusively with traditional profit-making policies
 koi ekamusth bhugtan policy is shrenee main aati he yaa nahin yah tay karne kaa sabase saral tarika yah he ki aap yah dekhen ki aapaki policy ke dastauez ikaiyon kaa ullekh karte samay ikaiyon ko laabh yukt ekikrut ikaiyaan bataate hai yaa unit-linkd policy bataate hai, yadi laabh sterling main hota he to ikaiyon kaa koi ullekh nahin hota he or tab yah sambhawatah paaramparik laabh yukt policy hoti he
 Other types of policy - "unit-linked" and "integrated with profit" policies have a performance component that directly depends on the current market investment conditions
 inkaa vyavsaayik prayog sambhav nahin hota he kyonki is policy par milane vaali guarantee bahut kam hoti he or iske bazaar mulya va sarender mulya ke bich koi antar nahin hota he
 The revised lump sum payment was created in the Technical Corrections Act of 1988 as a response to the use of single premium life as a shelter
 yah sanvidaayen 7 stareey vaarshik premium se bhi nimna stareey hai or adhik kathor kar niyamon ke antargat aati hai 
 yah iaare-ke saamaan vaarshikvritti niyamon ke bhi adheen hai 
 yadi ek jivan beemaa policy badal di jaati he or phir vah 7-bhugtan niyam ke liye upyukt ho jaati he to ise ek sanshodhit ekamusth bhugtan ke rup main punarparibhaashit kiya ja saktaa he

 In the history of Bikaner, a 500-year-old city of Bikaner, after finding historical evidence about the origin of the Pats, some historical evidence can be found on the basis of which the following conclusions can be drawn about the origin of the Pats
 1
 kavi shri udaichand khartargachh mathen kii ’’bikaner ghazal‘‘ 1709 naamak rachana main nagar va bazaar varnan kavy main chowk kaa sandarbh shaamil he, jisamen likhaa gaya he ki - That is, in the middle of the market there are chowks on which the Seth-moneyleaders come and sit and talk about business, family and the whole world

 In 1838, a letter from the Bikaner Jain Association was sent for invitation to Shri Saubhagya Suriji named Virajit Khatargachh in Azimganj, which describes the picturesque Bikaner city

 Based on these historical evidences, the tradition of the Pats has been going on in the city of Bikaner since 1708, but on the basis of public beliefs, the tradition of the Pats has been going on since the time of Rao Bika because the rulers themselves ruled the seats

 Local people say that in the beginning the Pate used to be in the tents of the Sardars
 jab raav bika ne apane pita raav jodha se raaj chihn maange to unhone apni mrityu ke baad dene kaa vaada kiya
 When he died, when he asked for his sign from his half-brother Rao Sujaji, he refused to give it
 tab raav bika ne jodhpur par akraman kar diya or majaboor hokar jodhpur naresh ko ve raaj chihn dene padey
 This was Rao Bika's first political victory

 In which Takht is the sacred throne of the court
 iskaa aakaar pate ke samaan he
 When Rao Bika sat on this throne, he told his chiefs that "we sit in our court, you all sit in your tent party", that is, today we have sat on the throne in the court and all of you also have the throne in your tent
 Sit on usee din se pate deron ke aage lagane lage

 Diesel engine cars were long known in Europe, with the first models introduced in the 1930s by Mercedes Benz and Citroën
 The main advantages of diesel engines were that they had a 50% higher burn efficiency when compared to the best gasoline engines

 The carburetor was used in almost all road-going car engines until the 1980s, when it was used to obtain better control over the mixture of fuel and air, which was found by fuel injection
 Direct fuel injection was the first in aircraft engines
 Used in 1909, it was used in racing car engines in the 1930 Satak and was used in road cars since the 1950s

 For some time, electrics were considered superior due to their silent nature when they were compared to the noisy gasoline engine
 This advantage was removed in 1897 by Muffler, the inventor of Hiram Percy Maxim
 Thereafter internal combustion Shakti cars had two significant advantages: 1) long range and 2) four specific energy
 The battery electric vehicle was built to rival the internal combustion model and they were Had to Tsar until modern semiconductor controls and improved starting batteries
 Because they could deliver a higher torque at lower resolutions, electric cars did not require such a complex drive train nor the transmission that internal combustion cars needed

 Esteem power, mostly used for oil - or gas - used boilers, was used until the 1930s, but its major disadvantage was that it could not provide electricity to the tax until boiler pressure was available
 This is that it gives very low emissions and because of this the combustion process can be controlled very carefully
 Its disadvantages include weak heat efficiency and expansion needs

 Data mining is the process of extracting patterns from data
 chunki adhik data ekatrit ho rahe hai, jisamen har teen varsh main data kii raashi doguna ho rahi he, data mining in data ko jaankaree main badalane ke liye teji se mahatvapurn upkaran banataa ja rahaa he
 It is commonly used to design detailed practices, such as marketing, surveillance, fraud detection, and scientific discovery
 ek ore jahaan data mining kaa prayog data namoonon main pattern ko ujagar karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, yah jaananaa bhi mahatvapurn he ki data ke gaiyr-pratinidhi namoonay kaa prayog aise parinaam utpann kar saktaa jo domen ke suchak nahin hai
 Similarly, data mining will not detect patterns that may exist in the domain if those patterns are not present in the sample that is being "mined"
 parinaamon ko lekar aparyaapt jaankaar "upabhoktaaon" main ek pravriti he jo "data mining" ke liye "jaadui kshamta" dekhte hai or is takanic ko crystal ball ke samaan bilkul saafe dekhne ke madhyam ke rup main lete hai
 Like any other device, it works only in association with the appropriate raw material: in this case the pointer and representative data that must be stored by the user first
 Furthermore, the search for a particular pattern in a particular set of data does not necessarily represent the entire population of the pattern from which the data is derived
 isliye, is prakriya kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa he data ke anya namoonon par pattern kaa satyaapan or pramanikaranhai
 The term data mining has also been used in a related but negative sense, where it refers to a deliberate search for clear but not necessarily representative patterns in large numbers of data
 duusare bhav se bhram kii sthiti se bachane ke liye, data dreging or data snooping pad kaa aksar istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Note that dredging and snooping can be used as an exploration tool when the hypothesis is being developed and clarified
 manushya sadiyon se "haathon se" data se pattern nikaalata rahaa he, lekin aadhunik samay main data kii badhati maatra ne adhik swachaalit tareekon ko jaruri bana diya he
 Early methods of identifying patterns in data include the Baas theorem and regression analysis
 The proliferation, ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology have increased data storage and storage
 chunki data set, aakaar or jatilta main bade ho gaye hai, pratyaksh vaastavik rup se aankadon ke vishleshan ko teji se apratyaksh, swachaalit data sansaadhan ke jariye sanvardhit kiya gaya he
 This has been further encouraged by other discoveries in computer science, such as neural networks, clustering, genetic algorithms, decision trees, and support vector machines
 Data mining is the process of applying these methods to data with the intention of revealing hidden patterns
 kai varshon se iskaa istemaal udyog, vaigyanikon or sarkaron dwaara aankadon kii maatra ko chaanane ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he jaise vimaan yatri yatra record, janaganana aankade or bazaar anusandhan report ko utpann karne ke liye supermarket scinar data
 
 Assistance in the analysis of the collection of behavioral findings is one of the main reasons for the use of data mining
 is tarah ke data, agyaat antarsambandh ke kaaran akerekhastata ke prati samvedansheel hote hai
 An unavoidable fact of data mining is that the data in the set being analyzed may not be representative of the entire domain and therefore may not include examples of some important relationships and behaviors that exist in other parts of the domain 
 is tarah kii samasya ko sulajhane ke liye, vishleshan ko prayog-aadhaarit or anya tareekon ke prayog se, jaise maanav janit data ke liye chois modelling sulajhaate hai
 In these situations, the underlying interrelationships can either be controlled, or removed completely, during the construction of the experimental design
 data mining ke liye maanak paribhaashit karne ke liye kuch prayaas hue hai, udhaaharan ke liye 1999 europea cross industry standard process for data mining or 2004 java data mining maanak 
 ye viksit ho rahe maanak hai; in maanakon ke baad ke sanskaran abhi vikaas kii prakriya ke adheen hai
 Free from these standardization efforts, open-source freely available software systems such as rapidminer, Weka, KNIME and r Project have become an informal standard for defining data mining processes
 in pranaaliyon main adhikansh, PMML main model aayaat or niryaat karne main sakasham hai jo data mining model ko prastut karne ke liye ek maanak tarika pradaan karata he taaki inhen alag-alag sankhyikeey anuprayogon ke bich saajha kiya ja sake

 The major professional organization in this field is the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
 Since 1989 he has organized and published an annual international conference, and since 1999 has published a semiannual academic journal called "SIGKDD Explorations"
 computer data mining par anya vigyaan sammelan main shaamil hai: Knowledge Discovery in Databases was a name coined by Gregory piatetsky-shapiro in 1989 to describe the process of finding interesting, analyzed, useful and innovative data
 is prakriya main kai baarikiyaan hai, lekin mote taur par iske charan hai kachche data ko priprocess karnaa, data ko mine karnaa or parinaamon kii vyakhya karnaa
 Once the purpose of the KDD process is known, a target data set must be collected
 chunki data mining keval aankadon main pehle se hi maujuud pattern ko ujagar kar saktaa he, lakshya data set itnaa bada hona chahie ki isamen ye pattern shaamil hon jabaki yah itnaa sankshipt ho ki ek sweekaarya samay seemaa main isaki mining ho sake
 aankadon ke liye ek aam strot ek datamart yaa data warehouse he
 The target set is then cleared
 safai, shor or laapata data ke saath tippaniyon ko hataa detii he
 Clear data is transformed into a feature vector, one vector per observation
 a feature vector is an abridged version of raw data observation
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek chehre kii shwet or shyaam chhavi jo 100px guna 100px he usamen 10,000 bits kachche aankade shaamil honge
 chhavi main aankh or munh kaa pataa laga kar ise feechar vector main badla ja saktaa he
 By doing this, the data for each vector will be reduced from 10,000 bits to three codes for locales, dramatically reducing the size of the dataset to be mined and thus reducing processing
 The feature selected will depend on what the purpose is; Clearly, the choice of the "right" feature is the basis for successful data mining
 feechar vactor ko do set main vibhajit kiya gaya he, "prashikshan set" or "pareekshan set"
 prashikshan set ko data mining elgorithm ko prashikshit karne ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he, jabaki pareekshan set ko kisi bhi praapt pettern kii sateekta ko satyapit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Data mining typically involves four classes of tasks: data se gyaan kii khoj kaa antim charan he data mining elgoridam dwaara utpann pattern ko satyapit karnaa jo vyapak data set main hote hai
 Not all patterns found by data mining algorithms are necessarily correct
 It is common for data mining algorithms to detect patterns in training sets that are not present in normal data sets, this is called overfitting
 is par kaabo paane ke liye, moolyankan, data ke ek pareekshan set kaa upyog karata he, jisapar data mining elgorithm prashikshit nahin tha
 The Learnt pattern is applied to this test set whose results obtained are compared to the desired result

 The principle of working a gas turbine is similar to the principle of working a steam power plant
 antar bas itnaa he ki yahan bhaap ke sthaan par hawa kaa upyog hota he
 Air enters the compressor from the atmosphere, where it compresses
 sampidit vaayu ko dahanakaksh main laayaa jaataa he, jisamen eendhan kii sahaayta se vaayu garam kii jaati he
 Hot air comes out of the combustion chamber into the turbine and works through this device
 kaary karne ke baad vaayu baahar nikal jaati he
 Three thermodynamic processes are performed on the gases passing through the ideal gas turbine, these are in teenon ko milakar bresan chakra kehalaata he
 Two combustion systems are used: in do pranaaliyon main sthir daab chakra acha paaya gaya he
 The thermodynamic cycles treated in a gas turbine are: pratham prakaar ke chakra main vayumandal se taaji vaayu sampidak main pravesh karti evam tarabine main kaary karne ke baad vayumandal main hi nishkasit ho jaati he, kintu duusare prakaar ke chakra main baahar se taaji vaayu nahin aati he, varan usee vaayu yaa gas kaa barambar parivahan hota he
 To increase the efficiency of the turbine, various types of equipment are put into practice, the main ones being: sampidak se nikalakar sampidit vaayu isamen ek ore se pravesh karti he evam duusari ore se tarabine dwaara nishkasit gas pravesh karti he
 The gas is hotter than compressed air
 isiliye taap gas se sampeedit vaayu main pravesh karata he tathaa sampidit vaayu or bhi garam ho jaati he
 Overheating of compressed air requires less fuel in the combustion chamber
 isse sampurna sanyantr kii dakshata bad jaati he
 Any reduction in compression work increases the available power, which increases the efficiency of the plant

 This Chaityamandir of the Hinayana sect was built at the end of the second century AD, usually in the last eras of Andhra Pradesh
 yah bana praaia: karle kii parampara main hi hai, usee kaa sa iskaa chaityas haal he, usee ke se stambhon par yugal akritiyon isamen bhi baithai gai hai
 The difference between the two is that Kanheri's art is not as life-like and gracious as Carly's
 karle kii gupha se isaki gupha kuch choti bhi he
 Then, about one third of this cave is also incomplete

 And then these two carrier frequencies are transmitted by different but co-installed antenna systems
 prayek antina ek tang beam prekshit karata he, jinamein se baayan antina udanpattee madhyarekha ke kuch baanyin ore tathaa daayan antina kuch daayin ore
 The localized receiver placed on the plane measures the difference in modulating depth in the 90 Hz and 150 Hz signals
 lokliser upaskar ke liye prayek modulatting aavriti ke liye modulation gahraayi 20% hoti he
 Then the difference in the depth of both the 90 and 150 Hz signals is different according to the deviation from the midline of the incoming plane
 yadi vimaanchaalak ko 90 Hz yaa 150 Hz modulan sanketon main se kisi ek kii adhikta milti he, to iskaa sidhaa arth he ki vimaan madhya-rekha se vichlit he
 The horizontal position indicator or course deviation indicator in the cockpit indicates that this error can be corrected by moving the aircraft left or right
 yadi didm shunya he, tab vimaan madhya-rekha ke thik upar he evam sidiai kii sui thik shunya dikhaati he
 In this case the plane is located on the actual midline of the localizer, which corresponds to the midline of the flight board

 These signs are also shown on the board of the ILS placed in the cockpit of the aircraft
 ye upaskar praayah omni-bearing indicater yaa naiv indicater kehalaate hai
 The pilot controls the aircraft in such a way that the horizontal needle on the CDI board remains at the center line of the board
 ye sunishchit karata he ki vimaan udaan-pattee kii madhyarekha ke thik upar hi he
 The pilot thus gets vertical guidance and is able to land well at the touchdown point
