 a third trait group, disruptive syndrome, is commonly discussed and includes chaotic speech, thoughts, and behavior

 The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made based on the morphology of the symptoms
 tantrika sambandhi sahasambandhi vasteen paryaapt rup se upyogi maandand uplabdh nahin karaati he
 Diagnosis is based on the individual's own experience report and abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends, or co-workers, and subsequently a clinical assessment conducted by a psychiatrist, social worker, clinical psychologist or other mental health professional
 manorog sambandhi moolyankan main ek manorog sambandhi itihaas or maansik sthiti pariksha ke kuch rup shaamil hote hai
 The most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia is the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition DSM-IV-TR and World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-10
 Is obtained
 baad ke maandand vishesh rup se europea deshon main prayukt hote hai jabaki DSM maandand sanyukt rajya america or duniya ke baaki hisson main prayukt kiye jate hai or saath hi ve anusandhan sambandhi adhyayanon main prachlit hai
 The ICD-10 criteria emphasize first-class symptoms of Schneiderian, although, in practice, the synergy between the two regimes is very high
 diagnostic and statistical minial of mental disorders ke chaturth sanskaran ke anusaar, sizophrenia kaa nidaan karne ke liye, teen naidanik maandand puure kiye jane chahie: Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of a mental condition or widespread developmental disorder are present, or if the symptoms are the direct result of a common medical condition or a substance, such as alcoholism or its medication

 schizophrenia ] a more general medical and neurological examination is required to rule out a health-related illness that can rarely cause symptoms similar to psychiatric schizophrenia, such as metabolic disturbances, serological infections, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy
 And brain wounds
 It may be necessary to remove unconsciousness, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, rapid attacks and unstable levels of consciousness, and indicates an underlying health disease
 aam taur par jaanch purvavastha prapti ke liye duhraaye nahin jate hai jab tak ki koi vishisht chikitsa sambandhi sanket nahin ho yaa manovikruti rodhi aushadhi kaa koi pratikul prabhaav nahin ho
 Greek σχίζω = "I refute") Despite the etymology of the word, "schizophrenia" does not mean double personality, DSM-IV-TR main schizophrenia ke paanch up-vargeekaran hai
 The ICD-10 defines two additional modalities
 schizophrenia kii vaidhata ko naidanik ikai ke rup main maanane hetu aalochana kii gai he kyonki isamen vaigyanik vaidhata or naidanik vishwasaneeyata kii kami paayi gai he
 In 2006, a group of mental patients and professionals from the UK debated under the flag of a movement to ban the schizophrenia label because it was rejected because clinical studies of schizophrenia were diversity-based and stain-linked and He called for the adoption of a biological-psychosocial model
 britain ke anya manochikitsakon ke samooh ne yah kah kar is prayaas kaa virodh kiya ki ek ek praavdhanik vichaardhaara hone ke baavjood schizophrenia shabd upyogi he
 The class of different types of schizophrenia used in DSM has also been criticized
 anya maansik vikaron ke samaan, kuch manochikitsakon ne suzav diya he ki anya vibhinnataaon ke saath vyaktigat ayaamon ke aadhaar par iske nidaan ko liya janaa chahie, jisase ki vahaan saamaanya or biimaar longon ke bich ek khai ke bajaae ek satatta bana rahe
 This approach seems very meaningful and serious for research on schizophrenia and its relevance to psychological experiences, which are mostly not stressful, and also build a clear trust among ordinary people
 is avlokan ke saath sahmati pragat karte hue manovaigyanik adgar jones or manochikitsak tony david tathaa nasir ghaemi ne bhranti par saahitiyon kaa paryvekshan karte hue ingit karte hue kaha ki mithyaa bhram kii paribhaasha kii samarupata or sampoornataa ko paane kii ichha bahut logon kii rahi he, mithyaa bhram na hi kabhi aavashyak rup se sthir hote hai, naa hi yah galat hota he or na hi inamen vartmaan kii niyantran ho sakane vaali ghatnaayen hi shaamil hoti hai
 Nancy Anderson, an emerging researcher in the field of schizophrenia, refutes the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria in her criticism of abandoning its validity for clinical improvement alone
 ve is baat par jor detii hai ki isaki naidanik vishwasaneeyata kaa sudhaar karte samay naidanik maapdandon kii manovikruti par adhik bal dene se iskaa moolbhoot gyaan ko ham baadhit kar dete hai jiskaa moolyankan karnaa prastutikarnon main isaki badi vibhinnata ke kaaran sambhav nahin he
 This ideology has also been considered by other psychiatrists
 isi kram main ming tsang or uske sahyogi is baat par paricharchaa va bahes karte hai ki manovikruti ke lakshan sabhi main saamaanya ho sakate hai bhale hi iske antim str kii vikruti par vibhinnataayen ho sakati hai, jisamen schizophrenia ko shaamil kiya gaya he, bajaae iske ki schizophrenia kii ateology yaa hetuvigyaan ke vishisht vishaleshan par sachet karte hai ki dsam ke sambandh main bahut kam parichaalanaatmak paribhaasha schizophrenia ke nirmaan par "sahi" uplabdh he
 Neuroscientific Michael Foster Green goes further to suggest that the presence of specific mechanisms of cognition impairment can be used to produce phenotypes that are purely symptom-based alternatives
 sah haniyaan baadhita yaa kami ke aadhaar par manovaigyanik gatividhiyon ke rup main parilakshith hoti hai jaise dimag, aakarshan, kaaryon kii kaarywahi or samasya ko suljhaana
 Removing influential factors from schizophrenia criteria, even though this therapeutic system is widespread, has also led to resistance
 DSM main se ise nikaal dene ke parinamswaroop ek "samaj main nahi aane vaale" alag prakaar kii vikruti – sizophreniavikruti ban kar saamne aayi he
 Referring to very weak reliability, some psychiatrists have completely opposed the idea of schizophrenia as a separate entity
 bhav vikruti or schizophrenia ke bich shrenikrut antar ko craayepelinian dishotomi kehete hai, jisane anuvaanshik epidemyology ke aankadon ko bhi chunauti di he
 Because the reliability of diagnostics creates difficulty in the measurement of its associated effects, examples suggest that genetic and environmental factors may play a role in mixers in schizophrenia outcome
 udaahranon se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki schizophrenia ke naidanik upachaar main mahatvapurn kaarak nihit hote hai lekin ve paryaavarniya karkon or tanaav paidaa karne vaale ghatakon ke mahatv ko prabhavit karte hai
 The implicit idea of overpopulation can be extracted biologically in some people and is known as the stress – diathesis model
 yah vichaar ki jeevigyaanik, manovaigyanik or manochikitsakeey tathaa saamaajik kaarak, sabhi mahatvapurn he, ise "biopsicososhal" model ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Generational assessments of schizophrenia have shown that the problem of isolating the effects of genetics and studies of isolated environments have shown that a high degree of heredity is found in it
 yah bhi suzav diya gaya he ki schizophrenia visham antarnihit anuvaanshiki ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen vibhinn bade or chote jokhimon ke jeens ke badhane ke saath hote hai
 Some people have suggested that it is necessary to have several genetic and other risk factors, before one is affected by it, but there is no certainty in it either
 Recent studies of the genome wide association for schizophrenia and commonly practiced disorders are largely isolated, but there are still some shortcomings between these two disorders
 anuvaanshik se jude adhyayan metaenalysis ne bahut hi gambhir or thos udhaaharan gun-sutreey kshetra main shankaaon ke badhane par prastut kiya he, jo pratyaksh rup se vikarayukt schizophrenia 1 jin protein se sampark karata he, jo haal hi main zinc pifungar protein 804e main shaamil he
 Which is characterized by the trait 6 HLA region under which schizophrenia has been associated with rare deletions or microscopic mimicry of DNA sequences, and contains disproportionately neuro-signaling and brain development genes

 The most prominent central anthropomorphic dilemma is why schizophrenia occurs, if the disease is due to the associated causes of biological heterogeneity, can this variation not be selected and separated? It is necessary to have a complementary and global feature to maintain a balance between such significant inequalities
 atah anumaanit visheshtaon ke sabhi siddhanton ko amaanya kar diya gaya he yaa ve mahatvaheen sabit hue hai
 The occurrence of contingency factors with early neurovicas also increases the risk of developing schizophrenia later
 ek prakaar ke isi jigyaasu nishkarsh se yah pataa chalaa he ki schizophrenia se prabhavit logon main se zyaadaatar log thand yaa basant ke mausam main janmen the

 Living in urban environments continuously for a long time has also been considered as a risk factor for schizophrenia
 saamaajik asuvidha ko bhi iskaa ek kaarak mana gaya he, jisamen garibi or saamaajik vishmata ke kaaran palaayan, rang yaa nasl bhed, parivaar kaa bikharana, berogari or kamjor rahan-sahan vyavastha aata he
 Childhood experiences of abuse or trauma have also been implicated later in life as a risk factor for the diagnosis of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia ke liye mata-pita kii dekhbhaal ko jimmedaar nahin mana gaya he lekin asahyogaatmak sambandhon kaa tut janaa bhi iske jokhimon ke badhane main sahaayak hota he
 However, in about half of schizophrenia patients, it was found that they used drugs or alcohol, which are difficult to prove the association between drug use and the apparent contingency of schizophrenia
 iske liye aksar istemaal kiye jane vaale do vyakhyaaon main hai "iskaa lagaataar istemaal sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he" or "iskaa lagaataar upyog hi chizophrenia kaa kaaran he" or yah donon baaten sahi hai
 The 2007 metaanalysis estimates that frequent use increases mental impairment based on the amount of the drug, including schizophrenia
 iske bahut hi kam udhaaharan hai jo yah bataate hai ki sharaab kaa seven sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he, yaa yah ki maansik rup se vyakti kisi vishesh dawa kaa chayan apane swayan ke upachaar ke liye kar letaa he, is sambhaavna kaa sahyog karne vaale kuch hi udhaaharan hai ki dawa kaa prayog pratikul maansik str kaa kaaran jaise maansik tanaav, jigyaasa, pareshaani, ubaaupan or akelepan kaa kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Because psychosis itself is highly understood and metaemphatime can result in the presence of cocaine use or cocaine-based psychosis with similar symptoms, even when the user is avoiding it
 manochikitsa virdohi andolan ke taur par jane jane vaale prayaas jo 1960 ke dashak main atyadhik sakriy the, rudhiwaadi medical vichaardhaara kaa virodh karte hai ki sizophrenia ek beemaari he
 Psychiatrist Thomas Sasas insists that the psychopath does not get sick, but that person gets lost in the unconventional thoughts and habits that our society considers inconvenient
 ve kehete hai ki samaaj in parais prakaar biimaar or unki aadaton ko vargeekrut karke unke saath anyaay karata he or unke prati kathorta kaa vyavhaar apane saamaajik niyantran ke adheen karata he
 According to this ideology, 'schizophrenia' does not occur but it is a type of social construction, created by those who distinguish between the normal and the unusual in society
 ssaaj ne manochikitsakeey upachaar ke maamle main apane aap ko kabhi bhi "manochikitsa virdohi" nahin samajha he, lekin ve aisa maanate hai ki vayaskon ke bich paraspar paraamarsh se upachaar prarambh kiya janaa chahie basharte iske ki ise vyakti kii ichha ke viruddh us par thopa jaae
 a set of informal psychiatric systems has been designed for the development and care of schizophrenia
 sangyaan main laae gaye paddhtiyon ko naidanik upachaaron ke jokhimon ke saath chinhit kiya gaya he, visheshkar jab vyakti tanaav yaa vismay kii sthiti main hota he, isaki haniyon par atyadhik dhyaan dena, nishkarshon par ekadam pahunch janaa, aakasmik aropan karnaa, saamaajik or maansik staron ke bare main baadhit yuktikaran karnaa, apane andar kii bhaavana ko kisi bahari strot dwaara vyakt nahin kar paanaa or praarambhik taur par drishy kii samasya kaa hona or isaki ekaagratha se dekhbhaal shaamil he
 Some of the well-known features are global neurocognitive impairment in the brain, attention, attention, problem diagnosis, action or social cognition, while others are associated with a particular case and experience
 "adhardaar prabhaav" ke saman taur par hone ke baavjood haal ke nishkarshon se pataa chalaa he ki kai vyaktiyon main sizophrenia ke dauraan ucch bhavuk pratiuttaron, visheshkar tanavagrast yaa nakaaratmak indrio or aisi vikruti ke samvedansheeltaa lakshanon ke samroop vyapti kaa kaaran bhi banati he
 Some examples suggest that the theme of ambiguous belief and the experience of psychosis may be characterized by a disorder characterized by emotion, and affect the symptoms of how a person interprets their experiences
 isaki haniyon ko dur rakhane ke liye "surakshit aadaton" kaa upyog isaki abhaason ke kram main sahaayak hota he
 Examples of the role of the psychological system come forward on the effect of therapies on the symptoms of schizophrenia
 mastishk kii karypranali main kriyaatmak bhinnataaon ke pareekshan ke liye tantrikeey manovaigyanik jaancho or mastishk pratirupan takneekon jaise fmri or PET dwaara kiye gaye adhyayanon se yah pataa chalaa he ki bhinnataayen adhiktar lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag, hippocampus or canapati ke hisson main paayi jaati hai
 These differences have been linked to neurocognitive cognitive impairments that are often considered insane / psychiatric
 mastishk ke mijolimbik maarg main dopamine kii karypranali par vishesh rup se dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya he
 a major reason for doing this is the finding of results from incidental studies that a group of drugs, which block the functioning of dopamine and known as phenothiazines, may reduce psychiatric symptoms
 is avadharana kii pushti is tathy bhi hoti he ki amphetamins, jo dopamine ke straav ko yaati he, sizophrenia kii sthiti main yah manorog ke lakshanon ko bigaad sakati he
 a dominant concept, also known as the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, states that over-activation of D2 receptors causes schizophrenia
 yadhyapi, sabhi manorog pratirodhi prabhaavon main aam, D2 avrodh ke aadhaar par 20 varshon tak yahi mana gaya jab tak ki 1990 ke daa ke madhya main PET or SPET pratirupan ke adhyayanon ne samarthak pramaan nahin die
 This interpretation is now considered to be extremely common, as one of the newer psychiatric resistant treatments is as effective as the old one, but it also affects the functioning of cirrotonin and may possibly have a slightly lower dopamine inhibitory effect
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main neurotransmeter glutamet or NMDA glutamet abhigraahak ke ghataae gaye prabhaav par bhi dhyaan diya gaya he
 This concept is also supported by the unusually low levels of glutamate receptors found in posthumous brain testing of people who were previously treated for schizophrenia 199, as well as the discovery that glutamate inhibitory drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine Can simulate symptoms and cognitive problems associated with these situations
 yah tathy ki glutamet abhigraahak ke kam prabhavali hone kaa matlab he lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag or hippocample kii karypranali kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye janevaale jaanchon kaa sateek naa hona or yah ki glutamet dopamine kii karypranali ko prabhavit karata he, in sabhi ko sizophrenia main bhamil kiya gaya he, jinke chizophrenia main glutamet margon kii bhoomika main ek mahatvapurn madhyasth hone kaa pataa chalata he
 However, in the case of positive symptoms, glutamatergic treatment fails
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main mastishk ke kuch vishesh kshetron kii sanrachana or aakaar main bhinnataaon ke aadhaar par parinaamon main bhinnta dekhi jaati he
 Analysis of MRI studies in 2006 showed that for the first time patients with psychiatric symptoms had decreased overall brain and hippocampal volume, and that ventricular volume had increased, compared to patients with healthy controls
 haalanki, in adhyayanon ke anusaar wolum main ausat badlaav MRI ke tareekon dwaara tay kii gayi maapan seemaa ke najadik he, isliye yah tay karnaa bhosh rah jaataa he ki sizophrenia ek tantrikana prakriya he jo us samay bhaaru hoti he jab iske lakshan dikhaai padate hai, yaa yah ki ise ek aisi tantrikeey vikaas kii prakriya samajhnaa behatar he, jisamen kam umr main hi mastishk kii asaamaanya maatra taiyaar ho jaati he
 The psychoses of the first episode were associated with a significant reduction in psychiatric antidote drugs such as haloperidal, whereas the excessive decrease in gray matter volume was not associated with unusual psychiatric antidepressants such as olanzepine
 gairmanviya primets ke adhyayanon se pataa chalaa ki aadaar manorog pratirodhi dawaaon or asaamaanya manorog pratirodhi dawaaon, donon main grey or white matter main kami paayi gayi
 Analysis of diffusion tensor modeling studies in 2009 revealed two consecutive regions of fractional anisotropy reduction in schizophrenia
 One area was in the left frontal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, thalamus, and cingulate gyrus to the White Matter tract and the other area was in the temporal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, insula, hippocampus amygdala, temporal, and occipital lobe
 Went across the White Matter tract
 lekhak kaa kahana he ki sizophrenia main white matter tract ke do network prabhavit ho sakate hai, jisase un grey matter kshetron ke 'sampark tut jane' kii sambhaavna rahati he jinase ye jude hote hai
 During fmri studies, a deep correlation between brain default networks and taskpositive networks was observed in schizophrenia patients and may demonstrate a high degree of adaptation to attention to chronological observation and external observation
 adhik virdohi do network ke bich sahasambandh network ke bich atyadhik pratidwandvita pataa chalata he
 There are no reliable measurements for the advanced stages of schizophrenia, although the concomitance of both genetic factors as well as nonadolescent psychoses may provide a better estimate of how later treatment may continue
 aise vyakti jo 'atyadhik jokhimpurna maansik avasthaa' kii shrenee main aate hai, jinamein sizophrenia kii paariwarik prishrubhumi ke sathsath asthaayee yaa swaniyantrit manovikrutiyon ke lakshan bhamil hai, unamem ek vashar ke baad kii paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par ilaaj kii sambhaavna 2040 pratit tak hoti he
 The use of psychiatric treatments and drugs has been found to be far more effective in reducing the likelihood of individuals in the category of 'highly risky' than in patients with fully developed schizophrenia
 haalanki, manorog pratirodhi ilaajon ke dushprabhavon ke sandarbh main, un logon kaa ilaaj kahin adhik vivaadit he, jo kabhi sizophrenia kaa car nahin hue, vishkar disphigaring taradive diskinesia ke lakshanon vaale or durlabh parantu kahin adhik maarak neuroleptic mailinent syndrome vaale rogiyon main

 New medical thinking suggests that even early intervention in psychiatric conditions is a retrograde preventive measure to prevent later episodes and the long-term disability associated with schizophrenia
 is rog se mukti kii avadharana abhi tak vivaadit he, kyonki isaki paribhaasha par koi ekamat nahin he, haalanki lakshno ko dur karne ke liye kuch upaay haal hi main sujhaaye gaye hai
 Effective treatment of schizophrenia is often considered to be dependent on standard methods, one of the most common methods being the measurement of positive and negative symptoms
 lakshno kaa prabandhan or kaaryakshmata ko uyana, rogamukti kii tulana main kahin adhik prabhavi mana jaataa he
 Its treatment was discovered in the mid-1950s with the development and presentation of chlorpromazine
 iske liye dhire-dhire ek recovery model ko apanaaya gaya, jisamen ummiido ko tane, saktikaran or saamaajik manyata par jor diya gaya
 Severe schizophrenia conditions may require hospitalization
 yah svaichhik yaa anaichhik bhi ho saktaa he
 Due to changes in the recruitment process, it is no longer common for this to remain in the hospital for a long time, although it may need to be done
 aspataal main bhartee karne ke baad, uplabdh sahaayak sevaaon main kedron par pahunchnaa, saamudayik maansik swasthya dal ke sadsy kaa ghar aakar dekhnaa, yaa sahyogi saamudayik upachaar dalon, sahyogi karmchaariyon or roginiyantrit sahaayta samoohon ko isamen bhamil kiya ja saktaa he
 There is a belief among many non-western communities that schizophrenia can only be treated in more informal, community-controlled ways

 Many practitioners and researchers suspect that differences in respective levels of social engagement and acceptance are one of the reasons, however, that cultural studies are still needed to explain these results

 New and unusual anti-psychotic drugs are commonly used for chronic abnormal psychosis, but they are expensive and are prone to weight gain and obesity-related diseases
 san 2008 main, yues nashnal institute of mental health dwaara kiye gaye aakasmik pareekshan ke parinaamon main ye paaya gaya, ki ek pratham peedhee ke pratinidhi swaroop paaya jane vaala manovikruti rodhi, paraphanjin, anek naveen dawaaon ke 18 maah kii maatra kii apeksha adhik prabhaavshaalee va kifayati he
 The most unusual psychotic patient wanted to continue, ie olanzhapine, had risks of weight gain and metabolic disturbances
 chlojhapin un marijon ke liye sabase zyada asarkaari tha jo anya dawaaon par koi pratikriya nahin dete the
 Since its trial did not take patients with Tardive dyskinesia, its effects on these types of people could not be ascertained
 chunki isamen kaaphi kam pashchaat prabhaav saamne aae the jo ki gatishiltaa ko prabhavit kar sakate the, asaamaanya antipsycotics kai varshon se hi sizophrenia ke liye pratham pankti kaa ilaaj rahaa he, jab tak ki kuch dawaaon ko jo ki isi shrenee main the, unhe food and drug administration dwaara chizophrenia se peedit bacchon or kishoron ke liye hanirahit nahin maan liya gaya
 This benefit was definitely given, but with obesity and metabolic rate disturbance due to which its use remained questionable for a long time
 khaskar bacchon or kishoron main sizophrenia hone par unhe davaaiyon ke saath hi paariwarik vyavhaar chikitsa bhi di jaani chaiye
 Current criticisms have rebutted the claim that abnormal antipsychotics have some additional pyramidal postoperative effects, especially if it is taken in small quantities or chosen as an anti-psychosis of low potency
 sizophrenia se peedit mahilaon main asaamaanya manovikruti rodhi istemaal karne par prolactin ilveshan kaa asar dekha gaya he
 It is not yet known whether new antipsychotics reduce the risk of neuroleptic malignant syndromes, a rare but serious and dangerous neurological problem with the side effects of neuroleptic or psychotropic drugs

 For other patients who cannot or do not take regular medicines, long-term depot preparations of antipsychotics will be given every two weeks so that control can be done

 At least one study has suggested that in the long term, some patients can get good health without taking antipsychotics
 sizophrenia ke ilaaj ke liye manovaigyanik ilaaj kii bhi salaah di jaati he parantu isaki sevaayen adhikansh pharmacotherapy par jaakar tik jaati hai kyonki isamen pratipurti va prashikshan kii kami he
 Cognitive behavioral therapy is used for specific symptoms and is used to diagnose other symptoms such as self-esteem, social initiation and insight
 However, the results of prior tests did not reach any conclusion
 chunki ab ye therapy 1990 ke shishav kaal se ab tak kaaphi pragati kar chuki he, haal hi main hue kuch punarnirikshanon se ye maaloom hua he ki CBT kii chikitsa sizophrenia ke psycotic lakshanon par kargar hoti he
 Another type is Cognitive Remediation Therapy, a technique that is sometimes treated with neurocognitive deficiency present in schizophrenia
 neuropsycological punarvaas kii is takanic par aadhaarit purv sakshya iske sangyanatmak prabhaav dikhaate hai, isamen kuch badlaav yatha mastishk sakriyata ko lekar kiye ja sakate hai jinhe fmri dwaara napa ja saktaa he
 There is another method similar to this which is called cognitive enhancement therapy, it shows its effect on social cognition as well as neurocognition
 paariwarik chikitsa jise sizophrenia ke peedit vyakti se sambandhit puure parivaar par lagu kiya jaataa he, iske sakaaratmak parinaam mili hai yadi ise lambey samay tak upyog main laayaa jaae

 Training of social work has produced both positive and negative results
 kuch pareekshanon ne kuch srujanaatmak va khaskar sangeet chikitsa ke bhi sakaaratmak parinaamon ke sanket diye hai
 The Soteria model is also another option in which treatment is done in the hospital itself but with minimal medication use
 ise multiliu therapetic recovery mathed kaha jaataa he, ise iske khojakarta dwaara is prakaar se bataaya gaya he, din ke 24 ghanton main phinomenologic interventions kaa prayog avyavsaayik karmchaariyon dwaara kiya jaataa he, isamen bina kisi neuroleptic dawa ke ilaaj hota he, isamen ek chota, ghar ke jaisaa, shant, madad ke liye tatpar, surakshatmak va sahneeya saamaajik vaataavaran banaaya jaataa he
 Although its search results are limited, it was found in the 2008 results that this program is also effective in treating patients who have schizophrenia in the first and second episodes
 electroconclujiv therapy, ise sabase pehle di jane vaali chikitsa main sthaan nahin diya ja saktaa parantu aisi sthiti main, jab anya chikitsa kii koi pratikriya na ho
 This therapy is more effective when the symptoms of catatonia are also present, and is used according to the UK guide to the NICE whereby it is used only when there are symptoms of catatonia

 In the emergence of Web 2
0, the Internet provides a set of tools for people to build online social and business relationships, share information and collaborate on projects

 The key factors that ensure its success are its relevance to its customer, the value it provides to them and the strength of the foundation on which it is built
 ek majboot neenv ek aadhaar yaa manch kaa kaary karata he jis par sanghathan apni soochna ko kendrikrut kar sake or lekh tathaa press vijyaptiyon ke prakaashan jaise anya saamaajik media pranaaliyon ke madhyam se apane haal ke vikaas kii ore graahakon ko nirdeshit kar sake

 This platform is important because it also allows the organization to measure and monitor the impact of the organization on its customers

 ve lakshya, jinke liye saamaajik media kaa istemaal kiya ja saktaa he: Organizations need to define their goals for social media to succeed
 manchon ke bich lakshya bhinn ho sakate hai
 For example, Facebook may be used for customer service and broadcast updates while Twitter may be used for publicity
 youtube sanghathan ke parade ke peeche kaa nazaaraa dikhaa saktaa he
 The success factor depends on the goals: a goal can be a specific number of new customers as a result of the promotion; Another goal may be to respond to all customer complaints within a specified time in a customer service situation
 chunki saamaajik media tej gati se ubhar rahaa he, sanghathan aksar samrik ke bajaay swabhaavgat upasthiti sthapit karte hai
 In most cases, this development is appropriate to the extent where the organization needs to develop a strategy for the use of its social media and integration into the overall marketing plan
 saamaajik media aabaadi ke kranthik jansamooh dwaara apanaaya gaya he, jiskaa matlab he ki saamaajik media main upasthiti sanghathanon ke liye mahatvapurn he

 So if a bridal company wanted to advertise on Facebook, it could really make sure that their ads could only be seen by people who were engaged or who were dating, depending on how far they wanted to go
 This allowed Facebook to begin using the pay-per-click strategy that most advertisers hesitate because of the lack of influence on Internet users
 Facebook ke liye pe-par-clic ranneeti ke parinamswaroop, jab bhi koi Facebook prayokta ek vigyaapan par clic karata he, to har baar company vigyaapan ke liye Facebook ko bhugtan karti he

 The famous Chittorgarh fort of Rajputana, the pride of India, is built on a separate hill, about 2 miles northeast of Chittorgarh Junction, located in the middle of the route by train from Ajmer to Khandwa

 Moving a little further north from the Chatrang pond, there is a small place surrounded by a boundary wall called the King's Bhaksi
 kaha jaataa he ki is imaarat main, jise maharana kumbha ne san 1433 main banwaaya tha, malwa ke sultan mahmud ko giraftaar kar rakhaa tha
 The ruins of the Havelis of Bundi, Rampura and Salumbar look west at some distance ahead of Bhaksi
 isi ke purv main purana chaugaan he, jahaan pehle sena kii kavayad hua karti thi
 This is what people call Chaugan to run horses
 chaugaan ke nikat hi ek jhil ke kinare rawal ratnasingh kii rani padmini ke mahal bane hue hai
 a small palace is built in the middle of the water, which is called the Zanana Mahal and the side palace is called Mardane Mahal
 maradaana mahal main ek kamare main ek vishaal darpan is tarah se laga he ki yahan se jhil ke madhya bane janaana mahal kii sidhiyon par khadey kisi bhi vyakti kaa spasht pratibimb darpan main najar aata he, parantu peeche mudakar dekhne par seedhi par khadey vyakti ko nahin dekha ja saktaa
 Probably Alauddin Khilji had seen the image of Rani Padmini standing here
 padmini mahal ke talab ke dakshini kinare par ek puraane mahal ke khandahar hai, jo khathan rani ke mahal kehalaate hai
 This palace was built by Maharana Kshetra Singh for his daughter Rupati Khatan Rani
 isi rani se chachaa tathaa meraa naam ke do putr the, jisane san 1433 main maharana mokal kii hatya kar di thi
 To the southeast of the Padmini palace are two dome buildings, known by the people as the palace of Gora and Badal
 gora maharani padmini kaa chachaa tha tathaa badal chachera bhai tha
 After expelling Rawal Ratnasinh from Alauddin's camp, Gora Veeragati attained near Padan Pol in the battle and Badal was killed at the tender age of 12 in the war
 dekhne main ye imaarat itane puraane nahin maaloom padate
 Their construction style is also somewhat different

 It is called Rao Ranmal Ki Haveli

 Maharana Mokal was the son of Lakha from Hansa Bai
 padmini ke mehalon ke uttar main bai ore kalika mata kaa sundar, unchi kursiwala vishaal mahal he
 This temple was probably constructed by the Guhilvanshi kings of Mewar in the 9th century
 mul rup se yah mandir ek surya mandir tha
 The statues of the Sun installed in the Nijmandir gate and the outer side of the sanctum sanctorum are proof of this
 baad main musalamaanon ke samay akraman ke dauraan yah murti tod di gai or barason tak yah mandir suunaa rahaa
 After that the statue of Kalika was installed in it
 mandir ke stambhon, chhaton tathaa antasadwar par khudaai kaa kaam darshneey he
 This temple was renovated by Maharana Sajjan Singh
 chunki is mandir main murti pratishtha baishakh shukla ashtami ko hui thi, atah prati varsh yahan ek vishaal mela lagata he
 To the north-east of the temple of Kalika Mata is a huge tank, called Surajkund
 is kund ke bare main manyata yah he ki maharana ko surya bhagwaan kaa aashirwad praapt tha tathaa kund se pratidin praatah safed ghode par savaar ek sashasr yoddha nikalataa tha, jo maharana ko yuddh main sahaayta detaa tha
 In the center of the temple of Gaumukh Kund and Kalika Mata are the palaces of Jaimal Patta, which is currently located as a ruin
 rathod jaimal or sisodiya patta chittod kii antim shaakaa main akbar kii sena ke saath yuddh karte hue veergati ko praapt ho gayi the
 To the east of the palace is a large pond, which is called the Jamal-leaf pond
 jalashay ke tat par baudhon ke 6 stupa hai
 From these stupas it is inferred that there must have been a temple of Buddhists in ancient times
 mahasati sthal ke paas hi gaumukh kund he
 Here the natural underground water from a rocky Gaumukh continues to fall on the Shivling in the form of a waterfall
 pratham dalan ke dwaar ke saamne vishnu kii ek vishaal murti khadi he
 Kund has religious significance

 Near the Kunda, on the northern side, is a small Jain temple built during the time of Maharana Raymal, whose idol is inscribed in Kannada script
 yah sambhawatah dakshin bharat se laai gai hogi
 It is said that a tunnel from here leads to the palaces of Kumbha
 gaumukh kund se kuch dur do taal hathi kund tathaa khaatan baavdi he
 At the northern end of the Gaumukh Kund is the grand ancient temple of Samidheshwara, which has a very beautiful excavation work on the inner and outer parts
 iskaa nirmaan malwa ke prasiddh raja bhoj ne 11 veen shatabdi main karavaaya tha
 It was also called the Shivalaya of Tribhuvan Narayan and the temple of Bhoja
 iskaa ullekh vahaan ke shilalekhon main miltaa he
 It was renovated by Maharana Mokal in 1428, due to which people also call it Mokalji's temple

 From the temple of Samiddheshwar Mahadev, there is a wide plain between the kirkittastambha of Maharana Kumbha, which is surrounded by a wall on all four sides
 isamen pravesh ke liye purv tathaa uttar main do dwaar bane hai, jise maha sati dwaar kaha jaataa he
 This gate and coat were built by Rawal Samarsingh
 chittod par bahadur shah ke akraman ke samay yahi hadi rani karmavati ne sammaan va satitv kii raksha hetu teraa hajaar viranganaon sahit vishwa prasiddh johar kiya tha
 Several layers of ash found on the excavation of this place confirm this Karun sacrifice
 yahan do badi-badi shilaon par prashasti khudwakar uske dwaar par lagaai gai thi, jisamen se ek abhi bhi astitv main he
 Maharana Kumbha defeated Sultan Mahmud Shah Khilji of Malwa for the first time in 1440 AD and made this record in his memory for the presiding deity Vishnu

 Their names are also inscribed above or below each idol
 is prakaar pracheen murtiyon ke vibhinn bhangimaaon kaa vishleshan ke liye yah bhawan ek apurv saadhan he
 The geographical peculiarities of the country are also engraved in some paintings
 kirtistambh ke upree manzil se durg evam nikatavarti kshetron kaa vihangam drishy dikhataa he
 Once the lightning had broken the chhatri above it, which Maharana Swaroop Singh did
 kirtistambh ke uttar main jatashankar naamak shivalay he
 The exterior of this temple and the inscriptions on the roof of the sabhamandapa and other types of figures are admirable
 adhiktar murtiyan akhandit evam surakshit hai
 Maharana Kumbha built this magnificent temple of Barah avatar of Vishnu in 1449 AD
 is mandir kaa garbh prakoshth, mandap va stambhon kii sundar murtiyan darshneey hai
 Sculptures depicting various forms of Vishnu, skyscrapers made of the Nagara style and scenery depicting the contemporary Mewari lifestyle are the specialties of this temple

 These particles repeatedly collide with each other while flowing in the raging wind, causing abrasion and gradually becoming smaller
 saath hi jhanjhaavat ke maarg main jo pahaad, chattaane evam pathar ke khand aa jate hai, un sabake upar bhi ye baaluu jhonka kii bhanti aghat karte hai, jisase ve sabhi apgharshit hote rahete hai
 Generally, sand is not able to rise to much higher than the ground level
 is kaaran vaayu kii apradan-kriya-kshetra kii oonchaai bhi usee anupaat se simit rah jaati he
 As a result, in the desert regions often the lower parts of the hills and rocks become thin and narrow, but the upper body is left unaffected
 is prakaar ke adhoradan se kukuramutta aadi saddash kuch vilakshan akritiyaan ban jaati hai
 In the desert regions, the direction of wind is usually the same for a long time, due to which the direction of their abrasion and erosion is also unchanged for a long time
 is kaaran registaanon main vayutpann golashm gol matol na hokar, koniya or falkeey hote hai
 In fact, for them, the word 'gholam' is inappropriate and should be used in place of the German word decanter
 vaayu main apradan ke saath saath parivahan kii bhi vilakshan shakti he
 Fine sand and dust particles are carried by the vast quantities of air from the desert regions every year and deposit in places where their velocity decreases and the grass and shrubs obstruct its path
 is prakaar se pariwahit padaarth ke nikshepon ko vaiudh baaluu or vaiudh mrittika kehete hai
 In northern China, there is a large deposition of this type of eolian clay, which is 300 to 450 meters in thickness, and which the wind has brought here from the deserts of Central Asia
 varsha dwaara laae hue jal kaa kuch bhaag vashpikaran se pun: vayumandal main chalaa jaataa he, kuch dharaatal par bahata hua nadiyon ke maarg se samudr main pahunch jaataa he or kuch prithvi main ant:sravit ho jaataa he
 The part which flows on the ground is called runoff and the surface which is endowed, is called underground or visceral water
 in teenon bhaagon kaa parsparik anupaat sthaneey jalwaayu, sthalakriti or bhoumiki par nirbhar rahata he
 The amount of evaporation prevails in regions of humid climate
 samaan jalwaayu ke pradeshon me sthalakriti kii vishmata ke saath apwaahit jal kii maatra adhik hoti jaati he
 The circle of geology is also very important, because some rocks are very fringed, but their penetration is very small, such as rock and clay
 inke atirikt ek teesri shrenee kii shilaayein na to randhri hoti or na praveshya, jese granite
 Thus, the amount of water that is injected depends on the physical characteristics of the local rocks
 dharaatal main kuch gaharaai par pahunchne par, bhoomi or shail jal se santrupt ho jate hai
 The surface of saturation is called the ground level
 is str kii gaharaai kshetravishesh kii vaaðshak varsha kii maatra, sthalakriti or sthaneey bhoumikeey sanrachana par nirbhar hoti hai
 Generally, the soil is closer to the ground in wet areas than in dry areas
 samudr, jhil, sarovar evam badi nadiyon ke samipsth bhaagon main bhi yah str apekshaakrit dharaatal ke sameep hota he
 Due to drought, it goes deep and comes up when there is excess rain
 aantbhaum jal prishth main kitni gaharaai tak samaa saktaa he, yah baat bhi sthaneey shailon kii sanrachana par nirbhar he
 Water enters the foliage sites and estuaries between the rocks, so the depth to which the rocks contain foramen, or fissures, is as far as collapsing in most of the fissure due to the pressure of the underground rocks
 randhravkash bhi alp ho ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the visceral water does not go to the depths and starts moving towards the earth
 antat: iskaa lakshya samudr he
 Sometimes it reaches there by underground routes and sometimes it gets such routes, from which it again reaches the ground as springs
 khule hue tathaa chaude vidaron or sandhitalon ke atirikt, anyatra aantbhaum jal kii pravaahgati saadhanya ati mand hoti he
 This is why it does not have the power to perform any type of forced action, but it can do chemical action in favorable conditions
 vidar or sandhitalon ke anuprastha aage badhate hue yah, varshajal kii hi bhanti, deevaaron ke shailon ke khanijon ko oxikrut, carbonikrut, athwa jalyojit kar detaa he or is prakaar shail kaa apghaton ho jaataa he
 In the terrain where limestone rocks are present, there is a large area of working underground water
 carbonikrut jal main chuunaapatthar villin ho jaataa he
 Therefore, the water flowing from the limestone's seventies merges many parts of it into caves
 kabhi kabhi is prakar bani gufaaon kaa aakaar bada, kai sau meter tak lanbaa or 4-5 meter gaharaa ho jaataa he or inamen se bahata hua jal aantbhaum nadi bana detaa he
 Somewhere carbonated water starts dripping from the roof of the cave
 tapakate pani kii kuch bhaag vashpikrut hokar ud jaataa he or usamen viley calcium carbonate tapakanevaale sthaan par avakshepit ho jaataa he
 Frequent dripping of droplets at the same place and continuous precipitation of calcium carbonate at the same place creates a columnar amount, called stalactite
 isi prakaar kii kriya gupha ke farsh par tapake hue jal ke vashpkaran se bhi hoti he or usase bhi avakshepit carbonate se aisi stambhakar akruti banati he jo farsh se chat kii ore badhati he
 These shapes are called stalagmites
 kabhi kabhi stalegmite ek duusare kii ore badhate hue milakar gupha kii chat se farsh tak kaa satat stambh bana dete hai
 Sometimes there is no specific form of precipitated carbonate amount
 aisi avasthaa main use calk nisaad, tupha yaa travertine kehete hai
 In some caves, the amount of carbonate precipitated in this way becomes so large that such carbonate can carry on business
 upar yah ullekh kiya gaya he ki kabhi kabhi aantbhaum jal soton ke rup main pun: dharaatal par laut aata he
 This phenomenon depends on the specific configuration of local rocks
 yadi koi baluupathar kaa randhri shail, r, is prakaar vinyast ho ki uske upar or neeche purnataya athwa praaia: apargamya shail, mrittika, shell yaa anya koi usee gun kii shilaayein sthit hon, to aantbhaim jal randhri shail main risataa hua, apargamya shila ke upree sansparsh tal tak pahunchne ke baad, staron kii dhaal ke anusaar pashrvavarti disha main badhane lagegaa
 In the same direction, wherever that rock is uncovered in a natural cut, the water will start flowing in the form of springs
 bahudhaa shailon main upasthit bhranshatal bhi soton ke banane main sahaayta dete hai
 If due to a fault, the impermeable rock is displaced and located in the proximity of the stomata and permeable rock, then at the place where the erosion will be transverse to the natural cut, there will be springs falling
 soton ke pani main praaia: sadaiv khanij padaarth thodi bahut maatra main villin hote hai
 When their quantity is more than 1 per cent by weight, then it is called mineral spring
 par sarsaadhaaran vyavhaar main kisi bhi aise sote ko, jiske pani main villin khanij padaarth ke kaaran kuch vishisht swaad ho, khanij sota kehete hai
 But in normal practice, any spring, which has some specific taste due to the mineral content dissolved in the water, is called mineral spring; However, minerals like calcium carbonate are very abundant and do not give any flavor and magnesium salts start tasting even in very small amounts
 soton kaa pani bahudhaa dabaav ke adheen hota he
 There is a decrease in pressure as the water comes out and the solubility of water also decreases with it
 at: soton ke udgam sthaan par bahudhaa khanij padaarth avakshepit ho jaataa he
 The composition of this substance is usually powdery or silicic and, according to the depositional composition, is called calc nisad, or silicic acid
 kabhi kabhi louh carbonate, athwa anya lavan, yaa gandhak bhi avakshepit ho jate hai
 The water of any spring is very hot and sometimes the water is also radioactive
 bihar rajya main rajgir ke garam pani ke sote bahut prasiddh hai
 The water of these springs often comes from very deep parts of the surface
 kuch soton kaa pani aantbhaum na hokar megmiy utpatti kaa bhi hota he, arthath aisa jal jo sudur garbh main megmiy padaarth se nikle hue vaashp se yukt hota he
 Such fountain is called magmatic fountain
 kahin kahin aantbhaum jal aisi vishisht paristhiti main vidyaman hota he ki us sthaan par kuan banane se pani swat: upar chadh aata he or kahin kahin to pani kii dhar fauware kii bhanti dharaatal se kai meter tak upar uchhalati hui nikalati he
 These are called excretory follicles
 inke banane ke liye anivaary praveshya pratibandh ye hai: aantbhaum jal ek aise randhramay or apraveshya shail ke andar sanchit ho jiske upar or neeche donon ore apargamya shail avasthit hon, staron ke pravan kii disha main jal ke bahakar nikal jane kaa maarg avaruddha ho or jal kaa mul strothasthaan, kuna banane ke sthaan se itani oonchaai par ho ki vaanchhneeya taral sthitik daab utpann ho, jiske prabhaav se kuan banane par jal swat: dharaatal tak upar uth jaay
 a very remarkable condition has been found at the Neyveli site in the South Arcot district of Madras province, where huge peat deposits have been found
 vahaan utsrut jal kii daab or maatra donon hi itani adhik hai ki peet ke utkhanan main bahut kathinaayee hui he, tathaa jal ko niyantrit karne ke liye vishesh saadhan prayukt karne pade hai
 The river is very effective and functional among natural factors
 yah apradan, parivahan or nickshepan, teenon hi prakaar ke kaary atyadhik pariman main karti he
 Although the importance of the work of rainwater is of little importance, its effect and fruit appear to be more pronounced as the action of the river is concentrated in long and relatively narrow valleys
 varshajal kii bhanti hi nadi kaa jal bhi apni ghati ke tal or kinaaron ke shailon ko rasinic kriya dwaara apaghatit kar saktaa he
 The solute fraction of the decomposed material thus dissolved in the river water and the insoluble portion also flows along the ravine
 yah kriya nadi apane parvatiy pradesh ke maarg main sugamawa se karti he, kyonki vahaan ghaar itani vegvan hoti he ki praaia: sadaiv nae, anpadhtit shailon kii staren anaachhadit hoti rahati hai jisase ki ve sahaj hi kriya ke prabhaav main aati rahati hai
 But when the velocity of the torrent in the plains decreases, the valley floor is covered with clay and sand cover
 falat: anpadhtit shailon se sampark bhi kam ho jaataa he
 In areas where limestone rocks are high, chemical activity is very abundant in those areas, because the limestone dissolves spontaneously in carbonated water
 rasinic kii apeksh balkrit apradan karne kii shakti nadi main bahut adhik hoti he
 Generally pure water cannot degrade the rocks, but when sand and gravel are mixed in it, the situation changes, as they both support each other
 nadi kaa kaa jal shakti pradaan karata he or baaluu evam bajri apgharshan karte hai, jiske prabhaav se tah or kinare shanai: shanai: chote hote jate hai
 In addition, they themselves take part in desilting the rocks of the fold
 nadi kii apgharshan shakti ghaar kii tivrata par nirbhar he or dhar kii tivrata sthalakriti par aadhaarit he
 The more prone the gradient is, the sharper is also sharper accordingly
 saath hi jal kii maatra bhi dhar kii gati ko prabhavit karti he
 The speed of the blade increases with the ratio of its speed to its cube root, that is, if the volume of water becomes eightfold, the speed of the edge becomes double
 falat:, jin deshon main sookhe or barsaati mausam pruthak pruthak hote hai, vahaan nadiyon kii apradan shakti barsaat ke dinon main bahut bad jaati he
 Initially, the banks of the river are usually steep and rich, especially in hard rock areas
 kintu vayumandaleey karkon ke prabhaavavash, kinaaron ke upree bhaag shanai: shanai: apkshin hone lagate hai
 The decomposed and fragmented material produced by it carries the river
 iske falswaroop kalantar main nadi kii ghati kaa pariched j aakaar kaa ho jaataa he arthath uske donon kinare tal kii ore dhaalu ho jate hai
 The river flows from a high place to the sea, so its effort is always to cut the ground and lower it so that it becomes equal to the sea level
 is tarah nadi ke sheersh se sangam tak ke anudaidhry pariched kii pravanta sheersh kii ore sabase adhik or sangam ke sameep sabase kam hoti he
 In other words, the vertical erosion of the river is highest in the upper reaches of the valley and decreases as it moves towards the sea
 jab nadiyon kii ghati aisi sthit main pahunch jaati ki udhrvadhar kataav ek dam band ho jaay or uski ghati kaa tal samudratal ke samaan ho jaay, to vah apradan ke charam str par pahunch jaati he
 The valley in which the vertical erosion is intensely progressive is called Tarun, which has reached the peak, it is called old and its inner state is mature
 ek hi ghati ke vibhinn bhaagon main teenon avasthaaen vidyaman ho sakati hai
 If topographical changes occur in the area of an old Sarita valley due to the influence of prudential forces and the site reverberates, the river becomes rejuvenated and once again starts vertical harvesting
 saadharantaya nadi kii ghati kii pravanta kramik haati he, yadhyapi pravanta kii maatra sthaan sthaan par ghat bad sakati he
 But sometimes the diathesis also becomes obsolete and waterfalls are formed
 yah sthiti visheshkar aise pradeshon main hoti jahaan kathor or mridu shilaon kaa ekantaran hota he
 Soft water flows away easily and easily, due to which there is a large amount of engraving in the valley
 kathor str avarodhi he or jahaan kaa tahaan khadaa rah jaataa he
 The water flowing over it starts falling into the more carved part of the soft level of the valley
 is prakaar ghati kii pravanta akramik ho jaati he or jal prapaat ban jate hai
 Often, the location of these falls also gradually diverges towards the top of the river
 hota yah he ki prapaat ke sthaan par pani ke oonchaai se girane ke kaaran nadi kii dhar main teji aa jaati he, jisase uski apradan shakti or bad jaati he
 Just below the waterfall, a kind of dahl is formed, in which whirlpools begin to fall and the rapidly moving water in them starts cutting the wall of the waterfall
 is prakaar nichevala mridu str or bhi teji se katataa jaataa he or ek prakaar kaa talochhedan hone lagata hai, jisase kathor str niravlamb hokar baahar ko nikal aata he
 Over the course of the appendage, the most forward part of the stern is broken down in the absence of the longitudinally and the fall of the falls retracts as the measure of the fallen shell
 yah kriya barambar hoti rahati he or prati baar prapaat kaa sthaan kramash: peeche hat jaataa he
 Due to this type of erosion, due to the breaking of hard rock, a deep blast is formed from the initial place of the fall backwards
 jabalpur ke sip narmada nadi kii sangmarmar ke shailon main utkeern ghati or bhedaghat kaa jalprapaat is ghatana kaa sundar ddashtaant he
 The fall of the world-famous Nyagara River is made in this way
 vahaan kii gai maapon se maaloom hota he ki prapaat prati varsh apane sthaan se praaia: dedh meter peeche hat jaataa he
 It is estimated that at the same speed, it will usually take 20 to 35 thousand years to build the 11 km long valley of Nyagara
 or bhi kai paristhitiyon main jalprapaat ban sakate hai, kintu mulat: har avasthaa main ghati ke vibhinn avyavon ke apradan kii gati main antar hona aavashyak he
 These falls are salient to the young state of the valley
 apradan kii charam str avasthaa main pahunchne par nadi kii shakti apane pashrvo ko kaatane main lag jaati he
 When the valley is very straight, the two sides are cut by one, but inequality arises due to slight curvature
 ghati ke avatal pashrv kii ore dhar main adhik tivrata hoti he or isaliye udhar kataav adhik maatra main hota he
 Therefore by decreasing the velocity of the torrent towards the opposite convex side, not only the erosion stops but the asymmetry is further increased by the river and the path of the river becomes more and more curved
 is prakaar visarpi mode kii utpatti hoti he
 Often the dimensions of these turns are greatly increased and the turns also become very complex
 kabhi kabhi do mode ek dusre ke itane paas aa jate he ki unke bich kii ekadam sidhi duuri, nadi ke anuprastha maarg kii duuri kaa dashamansh yaa or bhi kam hoti he
 In such a condition, sometimes the narrow cervix between two turns begins to flow through a straight path, and one or more extracorporeal turns are discarded, which is called spasm
 nadi kaa parivahan kaary, praaia: sabhi prakritik karkon kii apeksha adhik prabhavi hota he
 The rock powder, gravel, sand, and soil produced by private erosion, all of which flows down the river to the sea, along with atmospheric factors, especially the rock powder and block produced by rainwater, in the course of some time By the way, they reach the valley of the river and holding it in the ravine, they all move slowly towards the sea
 jin bade bade khandon ko nadi kii dhar uthaane main asamarth hoti he, ve tah ke anuprastha ludhakate hue chalate hai or chote kan nilambit badhate hue chale jate he
 The power of transport is dependent on the speed of the torrent
 yadi gati main vruddhi kii maatra va ho, to parivahan shakti va6 ho jaayegi
 That is, if the speed doubles, then the transport power will become 64 times
 isse spasht he ki varshaati baadh ke samay nadiyon kii parivahan shakti or saath saath vinaash shakti kii maatra bahut bhayanak ho jaati he
 Residents on the banks of big rivers like Ganga, Brahaputra etc
 are well aware of this destructive power
 nilambit baaluu or mitti ke atirikt anekanek padaarth nadiyaan apane jal main villin kar, mahadeshiy bhaagon se samudr kii ore le jaati hai
 As mentioned in the cases of rainwater and visceral water, their chemical activity is abundant, due to which soluble substances are also formed in the same proportion
 yah sabhi padaarth kalantar main nadiyon main pahunch jate hai
 The rivers themselves produce some soluble material by their action and all of them reach the sea respectively
 gananaa kar yah anumaan kiya gaya he ki ganga or brahamputra apane sammilit maarg se praaia: 1100 n 106 ghan meter mitti or baaluu prati varsh bengal kii khadi main pahunchaa detii he america kii mississippi nadi dwaara prati varsh parivahit padaarth kii maatra 200n106 ghan meter hai
 The Hwanghao River of China carries such a vast amount of soil that the sea near its mouth remains yellow for miles and it is called the Yellow Sea
 dakshini america main amejon nadi dwaara bahaai mitti or baaluu se uske muhane ke saamne samudr ke tal main jo delta saddash bhoomi ban gai hai, vah praaia: 200 kilometre lambii he
 Estimated, the amount of material transported by all the rivers of the world is estimated to be 16 cubic kilometers per year
 jaisaa purvavarti khand main bataaya gaya hai, nadi kii parivahan shakti uski dhar kii gati par nirbhar hoti he
 So as soon as his torrent is in motion, some part of his load starts depositing immediately
 nadi ke maarg main sabase pehla mahatvapurn nickshepan centre pahaad ke tal main us sthaan par hota he jahaan vah parvaty pradesh chhodkar maidan main pravesh karti he
 Very large golashyams and small big buttons, which come rolling smoothly across the valley in the valley, sit at the bottom as they enter the river plain
 is prakaar pahaado ke tal bhaag main ek nikshep ban jaataa he, jise jalopha shanku, athwa pankhaa kehete hai
 Another important speed change is near the confluence of the river
 ek to ghati kii dhaal vahaan pahonchte pahonchte yon hi bahut kam ho jaati he, duusare samudr va jhil kaa pani bhi bahaav ko roktaa he
 Often the velocity of the torrent is reduced so much that the tidal velocity is greater than the velocity of the river, which at the time of the tide, the river's edge starts flowing backward
 iskaa fal yah he ki sangam ke paas ke pradesh main nadi badi tivrata se avsaad or talachat nickshepit karne lagati he or uski apni banaai hui ghati hi bharne lagati hai
 Due to the deposition of depression, the flow of the river becomes more difficult and the river divides into several small streams
 kalantar main is nickshepit avsaad main ek chauras maidan sa ban jaataa he, jisamen se anek choti dharaayen ati manthar gati se bahati hui samudr kii ore jaati hai
 This plain is triangular, with one vertex at the point in the river valley from where the current begins to divide and the baseline in front of it lies transverse to the coast of the sea
 is prakaar ke pradesh ko delta kehete hai
 Due to the blocking of motion at the confluence of the river, sand is often deposited in longitudinal zodiac signs, which is called balukabhitti, or rod
 jalodh shanku or delta ke bich ke bhaag main nadi bahudhaa mausami baadh or utaar se prabhavit hoti rahati he
 During the flood, the river gets so much water that it cannot fit in its valley
 falat: vah donon kinaaron ke upar se hota hua kuch dur tak fail jaataa he
 The region that comes under the influence of floods in this way is called flood plain
 us bhaag main nadi kii dhar kii gati mukhya dhar kii apeksha bahut kam ho jaati he, jisase vahaan prachur maatra main mitti or baaluu nickshepit ho jaati he
 In contrast, during flood, the speed of the main stream is much higher than the speed of normal time, so erosion increases there and the river takes away the previously deposited sand and soil
 jaisaa pehle ullekh kiya ja chukaa he, nadi kii cheshtaa apni ghati ko nirantar gaharaa kar, apradan ke charamastar par pahunchaane kii hoti he
 As the depth of the valley increases, it often comes such a situation that even during the flood, one cannot reach the floodplain
 aisi dasha main nadi ek nayaa baadh-maidan banaati he
 Puranwala is called the flood-plains river Vedika
 bahudhaa nadi kii ghaatiyon main abhinav tal se kaaphi upar donon kinaaron par, athwa ek hi ore, is prakaar kii vedikaaye dikhaai padati he
 Somewhere, 2-3 or even more Vedicas meet on top of each other on different floors respectively
 unke adhyayan se nadi kii ghati ke vikaas kaa itihaas janaa ja saktaa he
 In the higher mountainous regions and cold countries, there is snow in the cold season instead of water
 jin pradeshon main him-varsha us maatra main adhik ho jitna garmi ke samay main him pighalta he, ve pradesh sadaiv himachhadit rahete hai
 The height at which this happens is called the snow line
 yah oonchaai vibhinn vibhinn akshanshon or pradeshon main vibhinn hoti he, yatha himalay main isaki oonchaai praaia: 4,500 se 5,500 meter tak he, alps parvat 2,400 meter or norge main keval 1,500 meter he
 a large part of the sea is always snowed near the poles, especially at the south pole
 akaash se aate samay him rooyee ke gaalon ke samaan komal hota he
 In fact, there is abundant air in it
 jab ek badi raashi ekatrit ho jaati he, to upree staron kii daab se neeche kii staron main se hawa nikal jaati he or himakan aapas main milakar kathor barf ke rup main parivartit ho jate hai
 Due to the effect of gravity when collected over vast quantities, the amount of snow in the favorable topographic regions gradually slopes downwards and thus becomes a river, called glacier
 kalantar main nadi kii bhanti vah bhi apane liye ek ghati bana leti he
 Which she deepens more and more
 thos barf se utkeern hone ke kaaran himandi kii ghaatiyon ke kuch vishisht lakshan hote hai, jinamein se teen pramukh he: Their nits are wide and flattened, so that their upward passage is six-shaped, unki ghaatiyaan sarpil na hokar bahut dur tak ekadam sidhi chali jaati he or In place of the confluence of the main glacier and the tributary glacier, the bottom of the two valleys is rather gradual
 is kaaran sahaayak nadiyon kii ghati nilambi ghati kehalaati he
 Glaciers have very low speed due to solidification
 kahin kahin to dinabhar main keval 30 centimetre hi aage badhati he
 Sometimes the velocity is also relatively high
 alaska main kuch himandiyaan ek din main praaia: dhai teen meter bad jaati he
 This speed, similarly to the speed of the river, depends on the amount of snow and the slope of the regional gradient
 himrekha ke neeche pahunchne par barf pighalane lagati he or saadhaaran nadi kaa rup dhaaran kar leti he
 The melting glaciers are the primary source of water of almost all the rivers coming from the Himalayas
 jin pradeshon main himrekha samudratal main praaia: baraabar hi hoti he, vahaan himandi swayan samudr main gir jaati he
 At such confluences, large amounts of ice often break away from the original river due to the pressure of the snow coming from behind and flow into the sea and flow far enough away
 in raashiyon ko plavi himshail kehete hai
 Plowy icebergs can also be formed for other reasons
 bahut thande pradeshon main kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota he ki samudr ke paas jane par bhi himandi apana rup banaaye rahati he or tat ke sameep kii samudr tah ko bhi uttkeern kar apni ghati kaaphi dur tak aage badhaati chali jaati he
 There are many examples of valleys like this in Norway and Sweden, and they are called fyards
 nadi kii bhanti, himandi bhi chattaanon ko aparadit tathaa unase toote hue khandon kaa parivahan karti he
 But there is a great difference in the method of action of both
 jahaan nadi kii tah main anek chote-bade rode dhar ke veg se ludhakte hue aage badhate hai, himandi main unke ludhakne ke liye koi avasar nahin
 The piece that gets stuck in ice moves in the same state
 yatra tatra chattaanon ke bahut se tukade tuutakar himandi ke upar gir jate hai
 As the snowfall moves forward, these blocks also move forward as they are
 is bhinnata ke falswaroop jahaan nadi dwaara parivahit pathar kuch kaal ludhakte hue tathaa aapas main takaraate hue gol matol batiya swaroop ho jate hai, himdhar dwaara le jaye gayi khand ant tak koniya va nukile hi bane rahete hai
 Apart from this, with the help of the torrent, the river divides its transported material into separate parts on the basis of size and density, such as only thick gravel in places of sharp edge, thick sand in less sharp edge and lower and lower speed respectively
 When fine sand and clay are deposited in the valley folds alternately
 iske vipareet himandi padaarth ko isprakaar chhant nahin sakati, apitu uski lad main bade rode, maheen baaluu or mitti, vibhinn aakaaron ke khand, sab ek saath mili hue aage badhate hai
 And where glaciers begin to melt, all of them deposit together without any division
 himandi main padaarth ke parivahan kii shakti aparimit he
 Large sections of rocks can also carry snow with the same ease so that small particles
 is prakaar jahaan nadi kii ghati main maatr shail se pruthak krit badi badi rashiyaan bina chote khandon main toote hue vishesh dur tak aage nahin ja sakati, himandi kii ghati main ve nirantar aage parivahit hoti rahati he
 Where glaciers end and the snow melts, these large blocks fall
 sthaneey pradeshik shailon se inkaa koi matra sambandh nahin hota, isliye ve visthapit khand kehalaate hai
 While falling on the ground from the glacier, the first step on which they stick, they remain standing for many periods
 kabhi kabhi ye keval ek chote se kone ke bal girte hai or usee ke bal khadey rah jate hai
 In such a situation, their balance seems very stable and they are called misplaced segments
 ghati kii tah ke paas barf main phase hue khand apane nukile konon se tah kii shilaon ko kharonch daalate hai
 Depending on the pressure of the ice and the hardness of the rocks, these scratches are more or less deep
 kabhi kabhi bahut se chote chote khand paas paas hote hai
 All their rubbing creates many scratches in the same stone
 in khandon kii ragad himandi kii pravaah kii disha main hi lagati he, isliye sab kharonche ek duusare ke samaantar hoti he
 In this way, scratched rocks are called lined
 is vipareet kabhi kabhi aisa bhi hota hai ki himandi main nitil ke paas fasaa hua koi shailakhand ghati kii tah kii kathor shilaon sein ragad khaataa hua aage badhata he, jisase tah se sata hua uskaa pashrv chikna or faldaar ho jaataa hai or anya pashrv purvawat koniya va nukile chhot jate he
 In this way, glaciers are formed at the initiative
 kabhi kabhi himandi kii ghati main avasthit shailon ke tile, barf ke apgharshan se kaaphi chikne ho jaate hai or unke pashviry kone jhad jate hai
 Most of the grease occurs in the part of the mound that is on the opposite side of the edge, as the ice grows by rubbing it forward
 jo bhagpashrv kii dasha main hota hai, vah jyon kaa tyon khudara or nukila chhut jaataa he
 This type of mound is called rash mouth
 adhikanshat: himandi chattaanon ke khandon ko apane upree tal par hi parivahit karti han
 The rocks of the valley's bricks continue to break in time due to the effect of the frost, which causes the rock and powder to fall on the glaciers near its edges and in this way the material transported on both sides of the glacier is called the lateral moraine
 himandi ke madhya bhaag ke upar aarambh main shailakhand praaia: bilkul nahin hote, kyonki vah bhaag ghati ke kinaaron se dur hota he
 But at the confluence of two snow-rivers, the morae to the right of one and to the left of the other do not meet, and from the confluence, the middle moren becomes
 ant main jahaan himandi samaapt hoti he or barf ke pighalane se jal banataa he, vahaan barf kii sataha par or bich main laayaa hua samast padaarth girakar ekatrit ho jaataa he
 It is called Agartastha Moren
 isamen starikaran kaa nitant abhaav hota he
 If the glaciers begin to move past their first boundary due to changes in climate, or for some other reason, the ice will continue to push forward the entire amount of the previously formed frontal moraine
 iske vipareet yadi himandi sheersh kii ore hatati ho, to agrantasth moren kaa ek aster peeche kii ore banataa chalaa jayega
 Despite occupying three quarters of the land, the sea is constantly trying to increase its expansion
 pratyaksht: uskaa kaaryakshetra tatasth pradesh he, jahaan vah apni prabal tarangon dwaara chattaanon ko chhin bhinn kar bhoomi ke oobad khaabadpan ko nasht karata hua mahadesh ko apni sataha ke baraabar chauras banane kaa praytn karata he
 Even in calm weather, the waves repeatedly hit the rocks and hurt them, but during the storm, their strength increases by a thousand times
 bade bade tufaanon kii lehren praaia: 14-15 meter unchi uthati hai
 Fen, gravel and small ballasts thrown by him have been seen jumping up to 40-50 meters high
 prayek lahar apni samast jalarashi ke bhaar se tat par aghat karti he or aisa prathit hota he maano prakruti bahut bade ghan se tatasth pradesh ko peet rahi ho
 Waves also indirectly help in their erratic action
 sabhi chattaanon main maheen daraaren or chote chote chhidr hote hai
 When the waves hit the rocks suddenly and loudly, the air filled in these cracks and holes does not get an opportunity to exit and where it compresses
 laharon kii vaapasi ke samay pani kaa dabaav hatane par hawa phir fail jaati he
 This action takes place so quickly that the air that is being spread suddenly cannot even find its way out and it acts as an explosive power in a way
 kriya ke baar baar duhraane se daraaron or chhidron ke chaaron ore kii chattane fatkar tuutane lagati hai or chhidr kramash: bade hote jate hai
 Sometimes it also happens that the cracks open on both the sea and the continent
 aisi avasthaa main laharon dwaara dabaav padane par daraar kii hawa teji se jameen kii ore nikal bhaagti he or laharon kii vaapasi par utani hi teji se phir daraar main ghus jaati he
 With this happening repeatedly, the fine holes become larger and progressively become tunnels, which are called fahmoid is prakaar tatasth chattaane laharon kii pahunch kii oonchaai par dhire-dhire khekhali hone lagati hai, jisase uuparavaali chattaanon kaa ablamb bhi kamjor hota jaataa he or ve bhi shanai: shanai: tuutakar girane lagatati hai
 Gravity also participates a lot in this activity
 jahaan chattaane kai prakaar kii hon, kuch kamjor or kuch kadi, vahaan laharon ko, vastut: kisi bhi prakritik abhiktrta ko apana kaary karne main adhik suvidha hoti he; kyonki jab kamjor chattan cat jaati he, tab usase samparkwaali kadi chattan kaa aadhaar bhi kamjor ho jaataa he or uski nijee kadai kaa mahatv kam ho jaataa he
 Due to the impact of the waves, due to the breaking of the rocks, the pieces of various sizes are fast rolled and hit on the rocks, which themselves also break and become small and chubby
 isse samudr kii aghat karne kii shakti or bhi bad jaati he
 Over time the pieces are converted into gravel
 uske baad lehren unhen pal bhar bhi vishram nahin lene deteen, nirantar apane saath aage peeche dhasitati phirti hai
 As a result, after some time the pieces of gravel become very fine and very spherical, sometimes so small that they do not even sit in the bottom and are left hanging in the water
 kanon ke is prakaar chota va gelematol karne kii laharon kii shakti nadi kii apeksha kahin adhik hoti he, kyonki ek to nadi kii tah main ragadwali gati keval ek hi disha main, nadi ke bahaav kii ore hoti he, duusare nadi kii ghati ke nichle bhaag main dhar ke kam ho jane par bade bade kan jyon ke tyon pade rah jate hai or is prakaar unki uttarottar chote hone kii kriya band ho jaati he
 The tides and other types of ocean currents also contribute to the work of the waves
 inkaa vishesh ullekhneey prabhaav sangam ke paas nadiyon kii sankri ghaatiyon main hota he, jahaan jowarbhate ke kaaran tej dharaayen utpann ho jaati hai, jo balui kinaaron or pani main nimagn chattaanon ko kshay karne kaa prayaas karti hai
 These streams carry soil and sand far away from the mouth of the river and all the coastline towards the sea
 laharon ke aghat kaa prabhaav pani kii sataha se upar nikali hui bhoomi tak hi simit nahin rahata, varan samudr ke chhichley bhaagon kii tah par bhi padataa he
 It is known from experience that often their power to decay to a depth of 30 meters remains functional
 sataha ke neeche laharon kaa kaary praaia: vaisaa hi hota he jaisaa badi hui ghaas ko hansiye se kaatane kaa, arthath yon samajhnaa chahie ki lehren apane aghat se samudr main duube hue shailon kii oonchaai main asamanta dur kar ek chauras sthaan banane kaa prayaas karti hai
 Measuring the depth of the sea from place to place, it is known that around the entire land, there is usually a flat plain at a depth of 30 meters
 is maidan kii samudri anaachhadan kaa maidan kehete hai
 The natural properties of the sea and lakes differ only in size
 samudr jahaan ati vishaal evam athaah jalarashi he, jhil apekshaakrit bahut chota jalashay he
 Due to this, the velocity of waves rising in the lake and the magnitude of tides is smaller than that of the sea
 falat: bhuprishth ke prati jhil kii apardi kriya praaia: samudr ke samaan hi hoti he, keval uski maatra jhil ke aakaar ke anuroop laghu ho jaati he
 In the above description, the description of various natural factors, the transport of erosive and non-sedative action and the depression arising from it, etc
 is described
 yahan yah baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki prayek kaarak kaa kaaryakshetra vishisht he
 He takes the undissolved and decomposed material produced by his action to the lowest place of his field of action, from where the second factor according to time and environment takes him under its influence to the lowest surface of his field
 udaahranarth, varshajal kii kriya se utpann apaghatit padaarth jal kii choti choti dhaaraon evam naaliyon dwaara nadi main pahunch jaati hai or phir nadi use samudr athwa jhil main pahunchaa detii he
 In this way, the rocks formed by the frost reach the bottom of the hill with the effect of gravity and then remain there until they are under the influence of some other factor
 himandi apni kriya se utpann avsaad ko parivahit kar apane galane ke sthaan tak le jaati he
 There his influence ceases and then he comes under the influence of the river Depression
 bhuprishth kaa sabase nichalaa sthaan samudr he
 Thus, the last point of depression resulting from erosion and decomposition of rocks is the sea
 avasthavishesh ke kaaran yah ho saktaa he ki yah padaarth maarg main kisi kisi sthaan par kuch kaal tak rukta hua aage bade; phir bhi, der saber, kabhi mand gati se, kabhi tej gati se, vah samudr kii ore yatra karata hi rahata he
 The maximum load of the depression reaching the sea is upstream
 is baat kaa pehle ullekh kiya ja chukaa he ki nadi main apane parivahit padaarth ko uske aakaar ke aadhaar par bajri, baaluu, mitti ityadi main vargeekrut karne kii shakti he
 Hence, most of the depression is divided into thick, medium and fine three sections, which are deposited at a greater distance from the coast respectively, that is, the particles near the same level of the coast will be larger and smaller in the farthest part
 
 kisi bhi ek sthaan par jyon jyon avsaad adhik maatra main sanchit hoga, vahaan kaa jal bhi apekshaakrit chhichhlaa hota jayega or iske falswaroop dhar kaa veg bhi kuch bad jayega
 Therefore, the entire depression will precipitate at some distance than before and the accumulated depression will become somewhat thicker at each place, like small sand on top of small pebbles and gravel, fine sand over thick and soil over fine sand
 kuch kaal ke uparaant or adhik avsaad ke sanchit hone se samast pradesh phir or chhichhlaa ho jayega or tab avsaad kaa nickshepan pun: ek ek pag or aage pahunchne lagenge
 If, for some reason, the bottom of the sea in the above deposition center is slowly slipping and the speed of sliding is equal to the speed of depression, then even after maximum depression has accumulated, the depth of the sea will eventually remain as it is and every The deposition of particles of the same size at the place will be continuous for a long time
 ek or dasha aisi bhi ho sakati he jab samudr kii tah ke khisakane kii gati avsaad ke sanchit hone kii gati se adhik ho jaay
 In that case the effect will be reversed and the ocean will become more and more deep even after depression accumulates
 falat: vibhinn aakaar ke kanon ke nickshepan kaa sthaan kramash: ek ek pag tat kii ore badhata jayega
 In the first and third positions mentioned above, there is a convergence of different sized quantities and in the second case the same size depression accumulates in thick quantities
 adhikansh nadiyon dwaara laae hue avsaad kii maatra varsha rituon main bahut kam hoti he
 Therefore, during the rainy season, depression is very abundant in the ocean
 bahudhaa do uttarottar varsha rituon ke bich kii avadhi main sanchit avsaad kii maatra naganya hoti he
 In such a situation, the depression accumulates intermittently and the depression in one rainy season gives an opportunity to harden and suppress before the depression of the second season
