 One-headed drums typically have a skin that is stretched over an enclosed space or on one end of a hollow vessel
 jin drumon main do sir hote hai or unke belanaakaar khol ke donon sire dhanke hote hai unamem aksar ek chota chhed hota he jo kuch had tak donon siron ke bich aadhe raste main sthit hota he; yah khol parinami dhwani ke liye ek gunjyman chembar kaa nirmaan karata he
 Exceptions include African slit drums and Caribbean steel drums, the former of which is known as a log drum because it is made of a hollow tree trunk and the second is made of metal casks
 do siron vaale drumon main taron kaa ek samooh bhi ho saktaa he jise snair kaha jaataa he jo drum ke nichle sire, upree sire, yaa donon siron par laga hua hota he isliye ise snair drum naam diya gaya he
 In modern bands and orchestral drums, the drumhead is placed on the open portion of the drum which is consequently installed on the shell by a "counterhope" which is then installed through several tuning screws called "tension rods" that surround the perimeter
 Screws are tightened in evenly placed lugs
 rods ko dhilaa karke yaa kasakar sir ke tension ko samyojit kiya ja saktaa he
 Many such drums have six to ten tension rods
 drum kii dhwani kai baton par nirbhar karti he jaise iske khol kii akruti, aakaar or motaai, saamagree jisase khol bana hota he, counterhoop saamagree, istemaal kiye gaye drumhed kaa prakaar or isamen lagaaya gaya tension, drum kii sthiti, sthaan or veg or kone jisamen ise maaraa jaataa he

 kai kaarak utpann hone vaali drum kii dhwani kaa nirdhaaran karte hai jisamen drum ke khol kaa prakaar, aakaar or rachana, drumhed kaa prakaar or in drumehedon ke tension shaamil hai
 Different drum sounds are used differently in music

 jaiz drumer aise drumon kii chahat rakh saktaa he jinaki pich bahut zyada ho, adhik gunjyman ho or adhik shant ho jabaki rock drumer aise drumon ko pasand kar saktaa he jisamen jor kii dhwani utpann hoti ho, jo shushk ho or jisaki pich kam ho
 Since these drummers require different sound, their drums have to be composed a little differently
 drum kii dhwani par drumhed kaa sabase zyada prabhaav padataa he
 Each kind of drum head works for its own kind of musical purpose and has its own unique sound
 dabl-plai vaale drumhed ucch aavriti vaale harmonix ko kam kar dete hai kyonki ve baari hote hai or ve baari vaadan ke liye upyukt hote hai
 Drum heads with a white textured coating slightly suppress the sound of the drum, producing a less varied pitch
 kendriya chaandi yaa kaale binduon vaale drum headon se or zyada aawaaj dabane kii sambhaavna hoti he
 And drum heads with perimeter sound rings eliminate most overtones
 Some jazz drummers avoid using thick drum heads and prefer to use single ply drum heads or drum heads that do not suppress sound
 rock drumer aksar mote yaa coted drum headon kaa istemaal karnaa pasand karte hai
 The second biggest factor affecting the sound produced by the drum is the tension at which the drum head is placed in front of the shell of the drum
 jab hoop ko drum head or khol ke chaaron taraf sthapit kiya jaataa he or tension rods se kas diya jaataa he to head ke tension ko samyojit kiya ja saktaa he
 When the tension is increased, the amplitude of the sound decreases and the frequency increases thus increasing the pitch more and decreasing the volume
 khol kaa prakaar bhi drum kii dhwani ko prabhavit karata he
 Since the vibrations in the drum shell produce echoes, a variety of shells can be used to amplify the sound and to alter the type of sound that is produced
 khol kaa vyas jitna adhik hoga uskaa pich bhi utana hi kam hogi
 The greater the depth of the drum, the louder the sound they produce
 khol kii motaai bhi drum kii awaz ko nirdhaarit karti he
 When the shell is thick, the drum produces a loud sound

 prithvi kaa nirmaan lagbhag 4
54 billian varsh purv hua
 Initially, the Earth was a rocky, hot and desolate planet whose atmosphere was sparse, composed of hydrogen and helium
 aaj se 460 karod saalon ke dauraan is grah par jivan kaa vikaas hua
 Earth's structure is flaky
 vayumandal ke bahari chor se prithvi ke crode tak jo padaarth hai ve ek samaan nahin hai
 The density of atmospheric material is the lowest
 prithvi kii sataha se iske bhitari bhaag tak anek mandal hai or har ek bhaag ke padaarth kii alag visheshtaayen hai
 How did the Earth's flaky structure develop? grhanu va duusare khagoleey pind zyaadaatar ek jaise hi ghaney or halke padaarthon ke mishran se bane hai
 We get to know this by studying meteors
 bahut se grhanuon ke ikattha hone se grah bane
 The earth has also been created according to this process
 jab padaarth gurutvabal ke kaaran sanhat ho rahaa tha, to un ikattha hote pindon ne padaarth ko prabhavit kiya
 This caused excessive heat
 yah kriya jari rahi or utpann taap se padaarth pighalane / galane laga
 This happened during the origin of the Earth and soon after its origin
 atyadhki taap ke kaaran, prithvi aanshik rup se drav avasthaa main rah gai or taapmaana kii adhikta ke kaaran hi halke or baari ghanatv ke mishran vaale padaarth ghanatv ke antar ke kaaran alag hona shuru ho gaye
 Due to this separation, heavy materials moved into the center of the earth and light materials came towards the surface or upper part of the earth
 samay ke saath yah or thande hue or thos rup main parivartit hokar chote aakaar ke ho gaye
 Eventually it developed into the earth's crust

 During the Moon's birth, due to the horrific impact, the Earth's temperature rose again or it produced energy, and this was the second stage of resolution

 Many layers are found from the earth's surface to the core
 jaise: parpati, praavaar, bahya crode or aantarik crode 
 The density of matter increases from the upper part of the earth to the interior

 In the second stage, water and water vapor from within the earth contributed to the development of the atmosphere
 ant main vayumandal kii sanrachana ko jaev mandal ke prakaash sanshleshan prakriya ne sanshodhit kiya
 The early atmosphere had an excess of hydrogen and helium and it broke away from the Earth due to solar wind
 aisa keval prithvi par hi nahin, varan sabhi parthiv grahon par hua
 That is, due to the effect of solar wind from all the earth planets, the primordial atmosphere was either pushed away or dissipated
 yah vayumandal ke vikaas kii pehali avasthaa thi
 During the cooling and differentiation of the earth, many gases and water vapor came out from the inner part of the earth
 isi se aaj ke vayumandal kaa udbhav hua
 Initially the atmosphere had very high amounts of water vapor, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia, and independent oxygen
 vah prakriya jisase prithvi ke bhitari bhaag se gaisen dharti par ain, ise gas utsarjan kaha jaataa he
 Continuous volcanic eruptions led to the rise of water vapor and gas in the atmosphere
 prithvi ke thanda hone ke saath-saath jalawaashp kaa sanghanan shuru ho gaya
 The dissolution of carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere in rainwater caused a further drop in temperature

 On the surface of the earth, rainwater started collecting in the troughs, which would form oceans

 That is, the oceans are 400 million years old
 lagbhag 380 karod saal pehle jivan kaa vikaas aarambh hua
 Although the photosynthesis process evolved about 250 to 300 million years ago
 lambey samay tak jivan keval mahasaagaron tak simit rahaa
 The increase in oxygen by the process of photosynthesis is the creation of oceans
 dhire-dhire mahaasaagar oxigen se santrupt ho gaye or vayumandal main oxigen kii maatra 200 karod varsh purv purna rup se bhar gai
 The final phase of the origin of the Earth is related to the origin and development of life

 In the mathematics of complex analysis, the Eiler formula expresses the deep relations of trigonometric functions and complex exponents
 islar sutara ke anusaar, Where x is a real number; e is a mathematical constant that serves as the basis of the natural logarithm
 x kaa maan radian main hona chaiye, degree main nahin
 This formula is valid even when x is a complex number
 saral shabdon main islar sutara sabhi bahufalkon par paribhaashit he mukhya sutara nimna he : falak + sheersh = kor + 2 yaa f + v = e + 2yaa f + v - e = 2 YOU CAN EVEN PRACTICALY EXPERMENT THIS FORMULA ON EVERY POLYHEDRON 
 NOW LET'S MOVE AHEAD & KNOW MORE ABOUT THE EULER'S FORMULA
 LETS KNOW ABOUT ITS HISTORY AS MENTIONED BELOW :-euler's formula was proven for the first time by Roger Cotes in 1714 in the form 
 It was Euler who published the equation in its current form in 1748, basing his proof on the infinite series of both sides being equal
 Neither of these men saw the geometrical interpretation of the formula: the view of complex numbers as points in the complex plane arose only some 50 years later 
 Euler considered it natural to introduce students to complex numbers much earlier than we do today
 In his elementary algebra text book, Elements of Algebra, he introduces these numbers almost at once and then uses them in a natural way throughout
 This formula can be interpreted as saying that the function eix traces out the unit circle in the complex number plane as x ranges through the real numbers
 Here, x is the angle that a line connecting the origin with a point on the unit circle makes with the positive real axis, measured counter clockwise and in radians
 The original proof is based on the Taylor series expansions of the exponential function ez and of sin x and cos x for real numbers x 
 In fact, the same proof shows that Euler's formula is even valid for all complex numbers z
 a point in the complex plane can be represented by a complex number written incartesian coordinates
 Euler's formula provides a means of conversion between cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates
 The polar form reduces the number of terms from two to one, which simplifies the mathematics when used in multiplication or powers of complex numbers
 Any complex number z = x + iy can be written as where φ { \ displaystyle \ phi \ ,} is the argument of z — ie, the angle between the x axis and the vector z measured counterclockwise and in radians — which is defined up to addition of 2π
 Now, taking this derived formula, we can use Euler's formula to define the logarithm of a complex number
 To do this, we also use the definition of the logarithm that and that both valid for any complex numbers a and b
 Therefore, one can write: for any z ≠ 0 { \ displaystyle z eq 0} 
 Taking the logarithm of both sides shows that: and in fact this can be used as the definition for the complex logarithm
 The logarithm of a complex number is thus a multi-valued function, because φ { \ displaystyle \ phi \ ,} is multi-valued
 Finally, the other exponential law which can be seen to hold for all integers k, together with Euler's formula, implies several trigonometric identities as well as de Moivre's formula
 Euler's formula provides a powerful connection between analysis and trigonometry, and provides an interpretation of the sine and cosine functions as weighted sums of the exponential function: The two equations above can be derived by adding or subtracting Euler's formulas: and solving for either cosine or sine
 These formulas can even serve as the definition of the trigonometric functions for complex arguments x
 For example, letting x = iy, we have: Complex exponentials can simplify trigonometry, because they are easier to manipulate than their sinusoidal components
 One technique is simply to convert sinusoids into equivalent expressions in terms of exponentials
 After the manipulations, the simplified result is still real-valued
 For example: Another technique is to represent the sinusoids in terms of the real part of a more complex expression, and perform the manipulations on the complex expression
 For example: This formula is used for recursive generation of a sinusoid at intervals of x radians
 In differential equations, the function eix is often used to simplify derivations, even if the final answer is a real function involving sine and cosine
 Euler's identity is an easy consequence of Euler's formula
 In electrical engineering and other fields, signals that vary periodically over time are often described as a combination of sine and cosine functions, and these are more conveniently expressed as the real part of exponential functions with imaginary exponents, using Euler's formula
 Also, phasor analysis of circuits can include Euler's formula to represent the impedance of a capacitor or an inductor
 In general, raising e to a positive integer exponent has a simple interpretation in terms of repeated multiplication of e
 Raising e to zero or a negative integer exponent can be understood as repeated division
 a rational number exponent can be defined by radicals of e, and an irrational number exponent can be defined by finding rational-number exponents that are arbitrarily close to the irrational-number exponent, in a limit process
 However, to define and understand a complex number exponent of e, a different type of generalization is required for the concept of exponentiation
 In fact, several definitions are possible
 All of them can be proven to be well-defined and equivalent, although the proofs are not included in this article
 It is well-known that, for any real x, the following series is equal to ex: 
 This invites the following definition of ez for complex z: This can be proven to be well-defined; in particular, the series converges for any z
 a simple-to-state, equivalent definition is that ez, for complex z, is the analytic continuation of the function ex for real x
 This can be proven to be well-defined; in particular, it yields a single-valued function on the complex plane
 It is well-known that, for any real x, the following limit is equal to ex: This motivates the following definition of ez for complex z: For real x, the function f = ex is well-known to be the unique real function satisfying the differential equation: for all x
 This motivates a definition of f=ez for complex z as the function that satisfies the differential equation: for all complex z, where the derivative in f 'is defined in the sense of a complex derivative
 This can be proven to yield a unique function which is well-defined everywhere on the complex plane
 We would expect the function ez to have the following properties: It turns out that this uniquely specifies a function on the complex plane
 Various proofs of this formula are possible
 The first proof below starts with the "taylor series definition" of ez, while the other two use the "differential equation definition" of ez 
 Here is a proof of Euler's formula using Taylor series expansionsas well as basic facts about the powers of i: and so on
 The functions ex, cos x and sin x of the variable x can be expressed using their Taylor expansions around zero: For complex z we define each of these functions by the above series, replacing the real variable x with the complex variable z
 This is possible because the radius of convergence of each series is infinite
 We then find that The rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is absolutely convergent
 Taking z = x to be a real number gives the original identity as Euler discovered it
 Define the function ƒ, of real variable x, as The derivative of ƒ, according to the product rule, is: Therefore, ƒ must be a constant function in x
 Because ƒ is known, the constant that ƒ equals for all real x is also known
 Thus, Multiplying both sides by eix and using it follows that Q
E
D
 Define the function g by Considering that i is constant, the first and second derivatives of g are because i 2 = −1 by definition
 From this the following 2nd-order linear ordinary differential equation is constructed: or Being a 2nd-order differential equation, there are two linearly independent solutions that satisfy it: Both cos and sin are real functions in which the 2nd derivative is identical to the negative of that function
 Any linear combination of solutions to a homogeneous differential equation is also a solution
 Then, in general, the solution to the differential equation is for any constants a and B
 But not all values of these two constants satisfy the known initial conditions for g: However these same initial conditions are resulting in and, finally, QED goudpad yaa gaudpadacharya, bharat ke ek darshanik the
 He wrote a philosophical book called Mandukyakarika, which describes the principles of Advaita Vedanta using the terminology of secondary philosophy
 advait vedant kii parampara main gudpadacharya ko aadi shankaracharya ke 'paramguru' arthath shankar ke guru govindpad ke guru ke rup main samaran kiya jaataa he
 As a disciple of Shuk, Gaudapada should also be considered at the same time
 yadi yah sweekaar kar liya jaay to isa kii aathvin shatabdi main utpann shankar ke guru govindpad ke guru ke rup main goudpad ko kaise sweekrut kiya ja saktaa he? yadhyapi puranic log is dosha kaa marjan karne ke liye kehete hai ki goudpad himalay main samadhimagn the or govind ko "nirmaanchitt" main upasthit hokar advaitatv kaa upadesh diya tha
 Beliefs have no place in the field of cultivation of "nirmanachitta"
 haan, isse yah to siddh ho jaataa he ki yaa to goudpad shuk ke saakshaat shishy nahin the yaa phir ve govindpad ke saakshaat guru nahin the
 It is impossible to judge whether Gaudapada was an disciple of Shuk
 pracheenatar puraanon main goudpad kii aitihaasikta siddh karnaa uchit nahin jaan padataa
 Even if we consider Govindapada as an disciple of Godpada, there are many difficulties
 shankaracharya kaa samay praaia: 8 veen shatabdi isvi kaa uttarardh mana jaataa he
 If the normal lifespan of those days is also considered as 100 years, then Gaudapada will have to be considered in the seventh century
 parantu chhathi shatabdi ke ek buddha acharya bhavvivek yaa bhavy ne apane granth madhyamikahruy main vedant darshan kaa vivechan karte hue goudpad kii ek karika uddhrut kii he
 From this it is known that Gaudapada had already been revered as the Acharya of Vedanta before Bhavya

 If this is true, then Gaudapada cannot be the master of Govindapada

 Prof
 Wallesar has written that the word "gaur" used in the word "gaudapada" is country-specific, it is not the name of the individual
 advait vedant ke do prasthaan the - pehla goud prasthaan jo uttar bharat main prachlit tha or doosraa dravid prasthaan, jisaki sthapana swayan shankar ne kii
 According to Valesar the word "gaudapada" means - the Vedic philosophical epistemological treatise prevalent in Gaud country
 parantu is prakaar kii durarudh kalpana ke liye koi drudh aadhaar nahin he
 Vidhushekhar Bhattacharya has rightly said that if we receive a book, then someone should be an author of that book
 antarang pariksha ke aadhaar par yah dridhtaapurvak kaha ja saktaa he ki goudpad ke is granth ke chaaro prakaran ek hi lekhak ke hai
 Tradition The author of this book will have to consider a particular person named Gaudapada as the author of the book
 17 veen shatabdi ke baalkrishnanand saraswati ne "sharirak mimasaa bhashya vaarthik" naamak granth main likhaa he ki kurukshetra main hiranyavati nadi ke tat par kuch goud log rahete the
 Gaudapada was one of them
 parantu dwapar ke aarambh se hi samadhisth rahane ke kaaran unka asli naam logon ko gyaat na ho sakaa
 On the basis of this recommendation, Gaudapada should be in the vicinity of Kurukshetra
 'agadguru ratnamalastav' naamak granth ke anusaar goudpad kaa greek logon ke saath sampark tha
 Acharya worshiped him and Nishakishad Apalunya was his disciple
 apollonius bharat aayaa tha yaa nahin iske bare main greek itihasagyon main bada vivaad he or adhikansh vidvan maanate hai ki apollonius kabhi bharat aayaa hi nahin tha
 i had described India only on the basis of these heard things
 iske alaava greek granthon or apollonius ke bharatvarnan main goudpad kaa koi ullekh bhi nahin miltaa
 Nothing can be said about Gaudapada's personality other than that he was a yogi and a perfect man and the doer of Gaudapada karyakas
 goudpadakrit karikas hamaare saamne hai
 These karyas are divided into four episodes and are the work of a single person
 iskaa pehla prakaran aagam prakaran kaha jaataa he
 The reason for this is that the Karmakayam lecture of Mandukya Upanishad is present in this episode
 aagam arthath upanishad ke upar aadhaarit hone ke kaaran isko aagam prakaran kehete hai
 Some Acharyas call the karmis of this episode "agam" and do not consider them to be the works of Gaudapada
 kabhi-kabhi to in karikaon ko manducya upanishad ke saath jod liya jaataa he
 Vidhushekhar Bhattacharya says that these karikas were written first and later the Mandukya Upanishad was formed on the basis of these
 par yah mat tarksangat nahin he
 The proof of this case comes only from the agencies of this case
 ye karikas vyakhyanatmak hai
 Therefore, only the Mandukya Upanishad appears before them
 duusare prakaran main sansar kii vitathata yaa mithyaatv siddh kiya gaya he, at: uskaa naam vaitathy prakaran he
 The third episode is called the Advaita episode due to the rendering of the Advaita element
 saare mithyaa vivaadon kii shanti kaa pratipaadan karne ke kaaran alaatshanti kaha gaya he
 Vidhushekhar Bhattacharya is of the opinion that these four episodes are four independent works, not four chapters of a single book, as they are not interrelated
 saath hi chaturth prakaran ke aarambh main "tan vande dvipadambaram" kahkar buddha kii stuti ke rup main mangalacharan kiya gaya he
 Mangalacharan is done at the beginning of the scripture, Mangalacharan is not seen at the beginning of the episode in between
 at: chaturthprakaran ek swatantra granth he
 This opinion does not seem right because the first thing is that the four episodes are related to each other
 pratham prakaran main upanishad ke aadhaar par sthool rup se kuch siddhant upasthit kiye gaye hai or duusare tathaa tisare prakarnon main kramash: sansar kaa mithyaatv tathaa ek advay tatv kii sthiti kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 The fourth episode is subjunctive in which the Upanishads approved principles stated in the aforesaid three episodes are shown to be contradictory to the principles specified by Buddha
 is prakaran ke aadhaar par hi bhattacharya ne goudpad ko buddha kaha he parantu yadi ek prakaran ke aadhaar par hi unako buddha kaha ja saktaa he to pehle teen prakarnon ke aadhaar par unhen mahavedanti bhi ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 It is true that the principles of Gaudapada are close to Buddhists
 unka ajativaad madhyamik paddati par aadhaarit he
 The nature of the soul propounded by them seems like an imitation of Yogacharya's science
 unki tarkpaddati vahi he jo madhyamik shoonyavaadiyon kii he
 He has great respect for Buddha
 yah sab hote hue bhi goudpad shuddh vedanti hai, kyonki - In this context, it is important to note that Gaudapada is not only a follower of the Secondary Principles nor purely of the Yogachara philosophy
 jahaan unako tarksgant baat mili, unhone use grahan kiya
 He always tried to show that there is essentially no opposition between Buddhist ideology and formalist ideology
 jo virodh kiya jaataa he vah agyanamoolak he
 Gaudapada owes its Indian philosophy
 shankaracharya ne isi samanvay ke maarg ko apanaakar apana advait mat pratishthapit kiya par unka mul gudpadiya darshan rahaa
 For this reason, Gaudapada salutes the Buddha only to establish his opposition to the philosophy, so this salutation should be accepted as a propitious subject of the scripture, not as Mangalacharan
 aisa prathit hota he ki is darshan main tark ko utana sthaan nahin diya gaya he jitna saakshaatkaar or anubhav ko
 The path of yoga is the main path, so there should be no place for rational opposition in that path
 jaise sidhon- gunduripa, sarahapa aadi- ke naamon ke ant main "paad" shabd aata he usee prakaar goudpad ke namat main bhi paad shabd kaa prayog goudpad ke sidhon ke sath sambandh kii ore ingit karata he
 The similarity between the couplets of Sarhapada and the works of Gaudapada is also visible
 ho saktaa he goudpad buddha or bauddhetar rtaksampradaayon ke bich kii kadi hon
 In addition to this corpus, commentary above the numerology is also considered to be of Gaudapada
 uttargitabhashya, nrisinghtapini upanishad tathaa durgasaptshati kii tikaa, subhagoday tathaa shrividhyaratnasutra bhi inaki rachanaayen kahi jaati hai

 When a group of pilgrims walked from Muni ki Reti to the next stop at Garuda Chatti, only those returning from the yatra were allowed to return to Muni ki Reti

 Two offspring born during the same pregnancy are called twins
 judawaan yaa to ek jaise ho sakate hai, jiskaa arth he ki ve ek hi yugmanaj se panape hai jo vibhajit hota he or do bhrunon kaa rup le letaa he, yaa bhratrik ho sakate hai kyonki ve do alag alag ando main do vibhinn shukranuon dwaara nishechit hote hai
 In contrast, a fetus that develops alone in the womb is called a singleton and one of multiple offspring born simultaneously is called multiple
 saidhantik rup se aisa sambhav he ki do singleton ek samaan hon yadi maa or pita ke donon gamet ke sabhi 23 gunasutra ek janm se agle janm tak sateek rup se milte hon
 jabaki prakritik paristhitiyon main aisa hona sankhyikeey rup se asambhav he, kisi din ek niyantrit sansarg sambhav ho saktaa he
 a less complex measure is the creation of genetically identical offspring through the cloning process, a process that has been tried successfully on many species of mammals
 judwa bacchon kii pahchaan karne ke liye antibiotic naamak test kaa prayog kiya jaataa he Twins are estimated to account for approximately 1
9% of the world's population, of which monozygotic / monozygotic twins make up 0
2% of the total population - and 8% of all twins
 sanyukt rajya america main judawaan janm dar prati 1000 jivit janmon main se 32 judawaan janmon se thodaa upar he, jabaki prati 1000 jivit janmon main se 45 judawaan janmon ke saath puri duniya main judawaan bacchon kii sarvaadhik dar yoruba main he, jiskaa kaaran sambhawatah ek vishisht prakaar ke jimikand kaa ucch seven he, jisamen ek prakaar kaa prakritik phitoistrogen hota he, jo prayek paksh ke andashay ko andey chhodane ke liye uttejit kar saktaa he
 Due to the limited size of the mother's womb, the likelihood of more than one pregnancy to last a full period is much less than that of a single pregnancy, due to which the average duration of a twin pregnancy is only 37 weeks
 yugmanjata judawaan bacchon ke jinom kii samanta kaa str he
 There are five common variations in pair making
 teen sabase aam prakaaron main sabhi bhratrik hai : The other two types are identical twins: gaiyr-judawaan janmon main, purush singhlatanon kaa hona mahila singhlatanon kii tulana main thodaa adhik aam he
 The singleton rate is slightly different in every country
 udhaaharan ke liye, america main janm kaa ling anupaat 1
05 purush / mahila he, jabaki italy main yah 1
07 purush / mahila he
 However, males are also more susceptible to death in the womb than females, and as twins have a higher fetal mortality, it is more common for female twins to develop than male twins
 sahodar yaa dviyugmanaj judawaan aamtaur par tab paidaa hote hai jab ek hi samay main garbhashay kii deevaaron par do nishechit andey pratyaropit hote hai
 When two eggs are independently fertilized by two different sperm, two mutual twins are born as a result
 do andey, yaa ova, do yugmanaj banaate hai, isliye unhen dviyugmanaj or biowlyur kehete hai
 Like any of the other siblings, there is little chance of mutual twins having the same chromosome pattern
 kinhin anya sahodaron kii bhaanti bhratrik judawaan samaan dikh sakate hai, visheshkar isliye kyonki unki aayu samaan hoti he
 However, mutual twins can also look very different from each other
 ve vibhinn lingon yaa ek hi ling ke ho sakate he
 The same is true for brothers and sisters from the same parent, meaning that fraternal twins are only brothers and / or sisters who are of the same age
 adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki aapasi judawaan bachche paidaa hone kaa ek anuvanshik aadhaar he
 However, it is only the mother who has an influence on the possibility of having a fraternal twin; There is no known process by which a father can become a factor in the release of more than one egg
 dviyugmanaj judawaan hone kii dar japan main chah prati hajaar janm se lekar kuch africa deshon main 14 or adhik prati hajaar tak he
 Fraternal twins are also higher among older mothers, as twins have twice the rate in mothers over 35
 samaan yaa ekayugmanaj / monoxigotic judawaan tab hote hai jab ek anda ek yugmanaj ko banane ke liye nishechit hota he jo baad main do bhinn bhrunon main vibhajit ho jaataa he
 It is estimated that there are 10 million identical twins and triplets around the world today
 sahaj yaa prakritik ekayugmaj yugma ke bare main, haal kaa ek siddhant maanata he ki ekayugmaj judawaan tab hote hai jab ek bijaguha anivaary rup se tut jaataa he or prajnak koshikaayen aadhi-aadhi vibhajit hokar saamaan anuvaanshik padaarth ko vibhajit kar bhrun ke donon ore vipareet pakshon main chhod detii hai
 Eventually, two different embryos develop
 yugmanaj kaa do bhrunon main sahaj vibhaajan ek vanshagat visheshta nahin balki ek sahaj yaa yadrichhik ghatana kehalaata he
 Monozygotic twins can also be artificially formed by fission of the fetus
 iskaa ivief ke vistaar ke rup main bhrun sthanantaran ke liye bhrunon kii sankhya badhaane ke liye bhi prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 Monozygotic twins are produced at a rate of approximately three per 1000 deliveries worldwide
 ek nishechan se samaan judawaan hone kii sambhaavna duniya bhar kii aabaadi main samaan rup se vitarit he
 This is in contrast to the possibility of fraternal twins ranging from six per one thousand births in Japan to 15 and more per thousand in some parts of India and 24 in the US, the main reason being mainly IVF
 ek yugmanaj kaa do bhrunon main bantane kaa nishchit kaaran agyaat he
 Artificial ambient fertilization techniques are more likely to have twins
 prati 1000 prasav main se prakritik garbhaadhan se keval teen jode judawaan prati hajaar prasav hote hai, jabaki ivief prasav main prati 1000 lagbhag 21 judwaaon ke jode janm lete hai
 Monozygotic twins are genetically identical and are almost always of one sex
 durlabh avasaron par, judawaan alag lakshan vyakt kar sakate hai or kuch atyant durlabh maamalon main, asaamaanya sankhya main gunasutron ke kaaran, judawaan vibhinn prakaar ke yon lakshan vyakt kar sakate hai, jo ki aam taur par ek XXY clinefelter syndrome ke kaaran yugmanaj ke asmaan rup se vibhajit hone ke kaaran hota he
 In fact, identical twins have nearly identical DNA and the changing environment affects genes that are turned on or off throughout life
 ise pashchjanan sambandhi roopantaran kaha jaataa he
 Studies of 80 human twins from ages three to 74 showed that younger twins have relatively few postnatal differences
 pashchjanan sambandhi matbhedon kii sankhya samaan judwa bacchon main umr ke saath bad jaati he
 Fifty-one-year-old twins had three-fold greater antigenic differences than three-year-old twins
 jin judawaan bacchon ne alag jivan bitaayaa tha unamem sabase adhik antar the
 However, some symptoms become similar with aging, such as intellectual level and personality
 This phenomenon shows the influence of genetics on many aspects of human characteristics and behavior
 samaan judawaan lagbhag hameshaa ek hi ling ke hote hai or unke lakshan or shaareerik rup bhi bahut had tak samaan hote hai par bilkul saamaan nahin hote
 Monozygotic twins look alike, although their fingerprints are not identical
 When mature, identical twins often lose parity due to different lifestyle choices or external influences
 samaan judawaan bhaaiyon ke bachche anuvanshik pareekshan main chachere bhai ke bajaay aadhe bhai bahan hote hai
 Semi-identical or semi-identical twins are an extremely rare type of twins, in which twins inherit genes similar to their mothers but different from fathers
 haalanki ardh-samaan judwaaon kaa udhaaharan paaya gaya he, unki avadharana kaa sateek tantra acchhee tarah se samajha nahin ja sakaa he, lekin saidhantik rup se aisa polar body twining main ho saktaa he jahaan shukranu koshikaayen dimb or dimb ke andar kii koshika sanrachana ko nishechit kar sakati hai
 This condition does not correspond to the common type of mutual twins in which two different ova are genetically fertilized by two different sperm
 is maamle main, ova anuvanshik rup se samaan hai
 There are three mechanisms by which this can happen: bina dil ke ek mrit tripsloid XXX judawaan bhrun par 1981 main hue ek adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki yadhyapi isaki bhrun sambandhi vikaas se lagata tha ki yah ek samaan judawaan he, chunki yah apane swasth judawaan ke saath ek hi naal ko saajha karata tha, pareekshanon se pataa chalaa ki iske ek polar body twin hone kii sambhaavna thi
 The authors were unable to explain whether a healthy fetus could result from polar body twinning
 2003 main ek adhyayan kaa tark tha ki kai maamalon main ardh-samaan judawaan bacchon ke kaaran tripsloidity ke kai maamle bade hai
 In 2007, a study reported a pair of surviving twins, one of which was bisexual and one was a phenotypical male
 donon judawaan chimeraj paae gaye or apane sabhi matra diene ko tathaa keval aadhe pitru diene ko saajha karte paae gaye
 The exact mechanism of fertilization could not be determined, but the study suggested that it was unlikely to be polar body twinning
 garbhaashayantargat judwaaon kii bhinnata kaa str is baat par nirbhar karata he ki kya ve do yugmanjon main vibhajit hue hai or kab hue hai
 The twin pairs were always two zygotes
 ekayugmaj judawaan garbhavastha ke samay main bahut jaldi do yugmanjon main vibhajit ho jate hai
 The timing of this split determines the chronological time and amniocentesis of pregnancy
 doikorionic judawaan yaa to vibhajit nahin hote yaa ve pehle 4 dinon main vibhajit hote hai
 Monoamnionic twins split after the first week
 bahut durlabh maamalon main, judawaan bachche sanyukt judawaan hote hai
 In addition, there may be multiple levels of environment shared by twins in the womb, which increases the likelihood of complication in pregnancy
 yah ek aam galat dharna he ki do naal kaa matlab he dviyugmanaj judawaan 
 lekin agar ek yugmanaj judawaan kaaphi pehle alag ho jate hai, to garbhashay main theliyon or naal kii vyavastha kaa dviyugmanaj judawaan se bhed karnaa kathin he

 Specifically, the study found that twins are more likely to be born to vegetarian mothers than 1 / 3 of vegetarians or omnivores and concluded that "diets that promote diet with increased IGF and dairy products Genotype, especially in areas where growth hormones are given to animals, in the possibility of multiple pregnancies due to ovarian stimulation Increases
 " From 1980–1997, the number of twins born in the United States increased by 52%
