 yatharthwaad yaa raajnneetik yatharthwaad, antarrashtriya sambandhon ke shikshan kii shuruyaat ke baad se hi antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa pramukh siddhant rahaa he
 This theory claims to rely on ancient traditional approaches, including authors such as Thucydide, Machiavelli and Hobbes
 praarambhik yatharthwaad ko adarshavaadi soch ke khilaaf ek pratikriya ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 Realists saw the outbreak of World War II as a proof of their lack of idealistic thinking
 aadhunik yathartwaadee vichaaron main vibhinn kismein hai, haalanki, is siddhant ke mukhya siddhanton ke rup main rajya niyantran vaad, astitv or swayan sahaayta ko mana jaataa he
 Realism has many important beliefs
 yathartwaadee maanate hai ki raashtra - rajya is arajak antarrashtriya pranali main aikik va bhugolic aadhaarit abhinayta hai, jahaan koi bhi vaastavik aadhikarik vishwa sarkaar ke rup main maujuud nahin he jo in raashtra- rajyon ke bich antah kriya yaa sahabhaagitaaon ko viniyamit karne main sakasham ho
 Secondly, it considers sovereign states to be the primary actors in international affairs rather than intergovernmental organizations, international organizations, ngos, or multinationals
 is prakaar, rajya hi, sarvocch vyavastha ke rup main, ek duusare ke saath pratispardhaa main rahete hai
 As such, a state acts as a rational autonomous actor in maintaining its existence, ensuring its own security and in pursuit of its own selfishness with these primary objectives and thereby its sovereignty and existence
 Attempts to protect
 yathartwaadee maanate hai ki raashtra rajya apane hiton kii khoj main, apane liye sansadhano ko ekatra karnaa karne kaa prayaas he or ye rajyon ke bich ke sambandhon ko satta ke apane sambandhit staron dwaara nirdhaarit karte hai
 This level of power is determined by the military, economic and political capabilities of the state
 maanav swabhaav yathartwaadeeyon kaa maananaa he, ki rajya swaabhaavik rup se hi aakraamak hote hai atah kshetreey vistaar ko shaktiyon kaa virodh karke hi aseemabaddh kiya gaya he
 Whereas other offensive / defensive realists believe that states are always concerned about the security and continuity of their existence
 rakshaatmak drushtikon ek suraksha duvidha kii taraf le jaataa he, kyonki jahaan ek raashtra khud kii suraksha ko badhaane ke liye hathiyaar banataa he, to vahiin pratidwandvi bhi saath hi saath samanaantar laabh praapt karne kii koshish karata he
 So this process can lead to more instability
 Safety can only be seen as a zero-sum game / zero-accumulation game, where only relative advantage can be found

 unhone kaha ki england ke saath rome kaa vyavhaar ek naaballig sauteli santan jaisaa tha, use pachaas main se keval ek cardinal pad diya gaya or us cardinal ke pope banane kii koi sambhaavna nahin thi

 Apart from the women he later married, the identity of only two girlfriends is completely undisputed: Elizabeth Blount and Mary Boleyn
