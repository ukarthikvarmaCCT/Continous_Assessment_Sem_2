 For this work] and alternating current can be used, but direct current is more convenient
 electrode do prakaar ke hote hai : carbon ke or dhaatu ke
 There are also three types of metal electrodes: bare, covered, and polled
 dhaatu ke electrode kii adhik kaam main aate hai
 Carbon electrodes are predominant in some automated devices
 jin electrodon main 0
9 pratishat se adhik manganeez mila hota he, ve bhi acha kaam dete hai
 Similarly, aluminum weld lights also work well
 yah dhaatu kii battiyon ke saath 18 se 30 volt or carbon ke saath 80 se 100 volt tak rakhaa jaataa he
 It keeps decreasing according to the length of the arch and there is also a deposit of molten metal by the same proportion

 Metal electrodes are 1 / 16 inch to 3 / 8 inch in diameter and are 12 inches to 18 inches long and carbon electrodes are 5 / 32 inches to 1 inch in diameter and 12 inches long
 vidyut dhara kaa pravaah electrode ke kaary or motaai ke anusaar hi hona chahie
 If the current of the stream is light, the metal of the electrode will not penetrate the wrinkles and will not even weld the surface
 yadi pravaah bahut tej hoga, to electrode kii dhaatu jal jaaegi or jod kamjor pad jayega
 Nevertheless, it is only appropriate that the speed of the electric current be kept somewhat faster than the ratio
due to the presence of a dhanke hue electrodon main adhik tej dhara pravaahit karne se uski gali dhaatu par slag nahin aane paata, jo uski raksha ke liye atyant upyogi hai
 He is very quiet in nature

 By using bare electrodes, its metal melts to the point of joining as large droplets, causing the electric arc to collapse
 Small droplets are released from the covering electrodes, the current is constant and there is no shortening

 While flattening the joints above your head, the angle of the light is kept from 60 to 90 degrees

 Pali literature mainly contains a collection of teachings of Lord Buddha, the founder of Buddhism
 kintu iskaa koi bhaag buddha ke jeevankaal main vyavasthit yaa likhit rup dhaaran kar chukaa tha, yah kahana kathin he
 Although there are some such references in Tripitaka itself, which shows the systematic reading of some episodes of religion during the lifetime of Buddha
 udaahranarth, udaan main varnan he ki ek baar seen naamak bhikshu se swayan bhagwaan ne poocha ki tumne dharm ko kaise samajha? iske uttar main us bhikshu ne 16 ashtak virgon ko puure swar ke saath gaakar suna diya
 God also praised it
 vinayapitak aadi granthon main bahushrut, dharmadhar, vinayadhar, maatrakaadhar tathaa panchanekayik, bhaanak, suttantik jaise visheshnon kaa prayog miltaa he, jinase spasht he ki buddha ke upadeshon ke dhaaran, paaran kii parampara unke jeevankaal se hi chal padi thi
 Based on this tradition, there are three references to musicals in the Chullavagga, Deepavansh, Mahavansh etc
 texts to give the Buddha's teachings a systematic literary form
 pratham sangeeti buddhanirvana ke chaar maas pashchaat hi rajgrih main hui jinamein 500 bhikshuon ne bhaag liya, jiske karan vah panchashatika naam se bhi prasiddh he
 It was presided over by Mahakashyapa and he collected the above topics with the approval of other monks, by asking questions related to the Vinaya and Suttha with Sthya Anand from the monk Upali, the disciple of Buddha
 isi prakaar kii duusari sangeeti buddha nirvana ke 100 varsh pashchaat vaishali main hui jisamen 700 bhikshu sammilit hue or isiilie vah saptshatika ke naam se vikhyath hui
 In this, by showing many faults in the conduct of the monks of Vaishali, they were held against Vinay and presumably special arrangements were brought in Vinayapitaka
 buddhaghosh ke matanusaar to isi sangeeti dwaara buddha vachanon kaa tripitak, paanch nikaay, nau ang tathaa churaasi hajaar dharmaskandhon main vargeekaran kiya gaya
 The third musical took place in Pataliputra during the reign of Emperor Ashoka after 226 years of buddha-nirvan
 isaki adhyakshata moggaliputt tiss ne kii
 The conference lasted for nine months and finalized the discourses in it
 isi bich moggaliputt tiss ne kathavatyu kii rachana kii jisamen 18 mithyaadrushti buddha sanshdaayon kii manyataon kaa niraakaran kiya
 This composition was also included in the Abhidhammapitaka
 is sangeeti kaa ullekh chullavagg main nahin he or na tibeti yaa chini mahayan sampradaay ke sahitya main
 There is no mention of any such music in Ashoka's Bhabru article, which also mentions the names of seven episodes, or in other scriptures
 is kaaran isaki aitihaasikta main kith, vailaser aadi vidwaanon ko andeh he
 But scholars like Rezdevids, Winternitz and Gaiger have accepted its historicity
 jis sangeeti kii aitihaasikta ke vishay main pracheen ullekh evam aadhuni vidvan ekamat he, vah he vaishali kii dwitiya sangeeti
 As a result of these music and other efforts, the form of Pali Tripitaka obtained and the form which is available to us today, is as follows: mul pali sahitya teen bhaagon main vibhakt he, jinhen pitak kaha gaya he - "vinayapitak", "suttapitak" or "abhidhammpitak"
 Each of these Pitakas consists of many small and large compositions related to their respective subjects
 pali ke in teen pitakon main i
 purv chhathi shatee main hue bhagwaan buddha ke vichaaron or upadeshon kaa ek vishesh style main sankalan kiya gaya he
 There is mutual correlation between the three pitas
 vishay kaa muladhar suttapitak he jisamen bhagwaan ke upadeshon ko shrotaaon ko hridyangam karaane ke liye saral se saral, rochak kathatmak style kaa alamban liya gaya he
 Here, there is no attempt to summarize the object
 uddeshy he nai-nai baton ko saamaanya shrotaaon ke grahan yogya bananaa or isiilie yahan upadesh ke mukhya bhaag kii baar-baar punrariti kii gai he
 Incidentally, these Sutts have also depicted the religious, social and political conditions of the time, which is very important from the point of view of ancient history
 udaahranarth, digh nikaay ke samanayfal sutt, brahmajaal sutt evam mahaparinibban sutt main buddha ke samasamyik dharmpravartakon jaise mankhaligosaal, pakudhakachchayan, ajit cese kambali, sanjay baltthiputt niganthnatputt, aadi ke aachaar-vichaaron tathaa unke dwaara pravartit dharm sampradaayon kii buddha drushti se aalochana pai jaati he or saath hi un-un vishyon par buddha manyata kaa pratipaadan bhi paaya jaataa he
 The social depiction is scattered in the Sutpitaka, although its contents are available to the Jatakas under the Kudak body
 sutton main sthaan-sthaan par buddhakalin magadh, videh, koshal, kaashi aadi 16 janapadon ke raajaaon unke paraspar sambandhon evam ladaai-jhagadon or daanv-penchon ke ullekh bhare pade hai
 The Buddhist ethos in which the signs of Buddhism are found in the sermons of sutas have also been arranged in the Vinaya Pitaka, from the law-prohibition-system as the rules of virtue worthy of the monks
 isi prakaar sutton main jis tatvachintan ke beej sannihit hai, unka darshanik shabdaawalee main saidhantik rup se pratipaadan or vivechan abhidhamm pitak main kiya gaya he
 Because of this interrelatedness, Buddhism cannot have complete sangopang and systematic understanding without Tripitaka's observation
 yah pali tripitak vishay kii drushti se swayan buddha bhagwaan ke upadeshon par aadhaarit he
 From the point of view of the available text, from the third century BCE onwards, it is not proved
 buddha paramparanusaar ashok samrat ke kaal main hi unke putr mahendra swayan buddha bhikshu banakar is sahitya ko lanka le gaye or vahaan pratham shatee i
 main raja battagamani ke rajyakaal main use vah likhit rup praapt hua jisamen vah aaj hamen miltaa he
 However, we do not find any such thing which can be visited in the period of two to three centuries due to the influence of the circumstances of Lanka
 apane namaanusaar vinayapitak kaa vishay bhikshuon ke paalane yogya sadachaar ke niyam upasthit karnaa he
 It has three different divisions - Suttavibhang, Khandhak and Parivar
 suttavibhang ke pun: do upavibhag hai - mahavagg or chullavagg
 Thus, compared to these subdivisions, the Vinayapitaka is divided into five parts
 suttapitak apane vishay, vistaar tathaa rachana kii drushti se tripitak kaa sabase mahatvapurn bhaag he
 It contains a collection of Sutras which according to tradition are either stated by Lord Buddha himself or are assigned by his disciple and approved by Lord Buddha himself
 sutt kaa sanskrit roopaantar sutara kiya jaataa he
 But the formulas presented in the Sutras are not visible in the formulas that are found in the ancient formulas of Sanskrit, such as the Srauta Sutras of Vedic literature, Grihama and Dharmasutra etc
 sutara kaa vishesh lakshan he ati sankshep main kam se kam shabdon main adhik se adhik arth vyakt karnaa
 There is a complete lack of repetition in it
 kintu yahan sankshipt style ke vipareet suvistrut vyaakhyaan tathaa mukhya baton kii baar-baar punrariti kii style apanaai gai he
 For this reason the Sutra version of Sutta does not seem appropriate
 vichaar karne se anumaan hota he ki sutt kaa abhipraay mulat: sookt se rahaa he
 Each episode of the Vedas has also been called Sukta
 kisi ek baat ke pratipaadan ko sookt kahana sarvatha uchit prathit hota he
 There are five parts of suttapitaka called bodies - Dighnikaya, Majjhimnikaya, samyuktanikaya, Angusadnikaya and Khudkadnikaya
 dirghanikaay teen virgon main vibhajit he
 The first sealakhandhavagga has 13 suttas, the second Mahavagga has 10 and the third patikavagga has 11
 is prakaar dirghanikaay main 34 sutt hai
 This Sutta is longer in detail than the Sutras stored in other bodies and this is the meaning of the name of this body
 majjhimanikaay main madhyamvistaar ke 152 sutt he jo 15 virgon main vibhakt hai - Of these, there are 12 suttas in the 14th class Vibhang and ten each in the rest
 sanyuttanikaay main chote bade sabhi prakaar ke sutton kaa sangrah he or yahi is nikaay ke naam kii sarthakata he
 There are a total of 56 suttas or samyutas divided into these five classes - angutar nikaay kii apni ek visheshta he
 In this, the collection of Sutras is done according to an arrangement
 aadi main aise sutt hai jinamein buddha bhagwaan ke ek sankhyatmak padaartho vishyak upadeshon kaa sangrah he, tatpashchaat do padaarthon vishyak sutton kaa or phir teen, chaar aadi
 In the same order within this body is a compilation of eleven niches of these names Ekknipat, Dukanipat & Tik, Chatuvak, Panchak, Chhak, Sattak, Atthak, Navak, Dasak and Ekadasak
 ye nipaat pun: virgon main vibhajit hai, jinaki sankhya nipaat kram se 21, 16, 16, 26, 12, 9, 9, 9, 22 or 3 he
 Thus, the total number of classes in 11 nipatas is 169
 prayek varg ke bheetar anek sutt hai jinaki sankhya ek varg main kam se kam 7 or adhik se adhik 262 he
 Thus, the number of sutas from Angusvada Nikaya is 2308
 khuddak nikaay main vishay tathaa rachana kii drushti se praaia: sarvatha swatantra 15 rachanaaon kaa samavesh he, jinke naam hai - The third part of the Pali Tripitaka, Abhidhammapitaka, analyzes and classifies the visual thoughts of Lord Buddha and presents lists and definitions from the point of view of nature
 is pitak main nimna saat granthon kaa samavesh he- Dhamamsani is divided into two parts according to her mother
 pratham bhaag main 22 tik hai jinamein se prayek main teen teen vishyon kaa vivechan kiya gaya hai
 There are 100 shops in the second department and each shop has a law and prohibition of two subjects
 ye duk 12 virgon main vibhajit hai jinke naam hai - Thus the number of dhikamsani's tikas and dukes is 122
 inamen se pratham tik kushal, akushal tathaa avyaakrit dharmavishyak he, jo sabase mahatvapurn he or uske vishay kaa prarupan chittupapad rup nikkshep or atthuddhar in chaar candon main kiya gaya he
 The theme of Vibhang is divided into 18 departments
 kathavatthu main 23 adhyyon ke bheetar 216 prashnottar hai jinamein virdohi sampradaayon ke siddhanton kaa khandan kiya gaya he
 There are 10 chapters in Puggalpannatti, in which, in the increasing order of one type, two type, etc
, in the tenth chapter, 10, 10 types of Pudgals, ie individuals, have been instructed
 vyaktiyon kaa vibhaajan pruthgjan, samyak sambuddha, prayek buddha, shaikshya, ashaikshya, arya, anarya aadi rup se kiya gaya he
 The basis of the composition of the metal story is different, because the first three, namely, the wing, volume and metal fractures of the same, have been discussed more closely here
 isi kaaran is granth kaa doosraa naam khamb-aaytan-dhatukatha bhi paaya jaataa he
 The relationship of these three is mentioned in the book by sitting with religions
 matikanusaar in dharmon kii sankhya 125 he jo is prakaar hai - These are interlinked in 14 chapters in the style of Q&A
 yamak main dharmon kaa sambandh vishesh vishyon ke saath paraspar vipareet rup main prashnottar style se samajhaayaa gaya he or isi yugal prashnaatmak reeti ke kaaran is rachana kaa yamak naam sarthak he
 Like are all skilled religions efficient? Are all Kushamul Kushal religions? And so on
 isi paddati se yamak main abhidhammpitak main prayukt paribhaashik shabdon kii sunishchit vyakhya dene kaa praytn kiya gaya he
 This composition is divided into these 10 punks - patthan main buddha tatvachintan ke aadharbhoot pratithya-samutpaada-siddhant kaa ek vishesh style main bade vistaarpurvak vivechan kiya gaya he
 The main four parts of the book are - in chaaron bhaagon main dhammsangani main nirdisht 22 tikon or 100 dukon kaa 24 pratyayon se sambandh nimna chah patthanon dwaara samajhaayaa gaya he : tik pan duk pan duk-tik pan tik-duk pan tik-dik pan or duk-duk pa
 With the preservation of these six articles in the previous four departments, the entire book is divided into 24 pieces
 uparyukt tripitak sahitya kaa sankalan praaia: i
pus
 teesri shatee main purna ho gaya tha, kintu pali sahitya kaa srijan iske pashchaat bhi chalata rahaa
 Although, in terms of the subject of relevant literature, it usually imitates the knowledge completely under Tripitaka, yet in its form and style, development is seen in it according to the pace of time
 i
pus
 pratham shatee ke lagbhag nettprikaran naamak granth likhaa gaya jisamen abhidhammpitak ke vishay kaa hi kuch adhik sookshmata se vivechan kiya gaya he
 It has attempted to explain the definitions of Buddhist philosophy through 16 necklaces, 5 new and 18 original verses
 iske karta kaa naam kacchan he
 a similar composition is the Petkopadesh of about this period, in which the theme of Netification is presented in some other way, in which the four Aryan truths are the mainstay which are the foundation of Buddha's teachings
 praaia: isi kaal kii teesri rachana he - milind-panhon jo pali sahitya main apni visheshta rakhti he va aitihaasik drushti se bhi badi mahatvapurn he
 It describes a conversation between the King of Sakal, Milind and the monk Nagsen
 milind us yavan naresh minadar ke naam kaa hi roopaantar mana gaya he jisane i
 pus
 dwitiya shatee ke madhya main bharat par akraman kiya tathaa punjab pradesh main apana rajya jamaaya tha
 According to the text presented, this king was very scholarly and interested in philosophical subjects
 usne bhikshu nagsen se bade paine darshanik prashn kiye, jiske uttar bhi nagsen ne badi chaturaai se sundar drushtaanton dwaara unki pushti karte hue die hai
 There are seven chapters in the book - inamen se pratham teen adhyay hi granth kaa mul bhaag mana jaataa he
 The remaining four chapters appear to be added backwards
 iske anek kaaran hai- ek to tisare adhyay main granth ke pun: prarambh kii soochna he; duusare, buddhaghosh ke avataran praaia: teen hi adhyyon se liye gaye hai or tisare is granth kaa jo chini anuwaad 400 i
 ke lagbhag kiya gaya tha, usamen keval ye teen hi adhyay paae jate hai
 This composition is very interesting in style and unique in its style for the knowledge of Buddhist doctrine
 in rachanaaon ke pashchaat atthakathaon kaa yug prarambh hota he
 According to the Shrut tradition, when Maali and Sanghamitra reached Pali Tripitaka Lanka and Buddhism flourished, those original texts were written in the Sinhalese language
 ye atthakathaayen ab uplabdh nahin he
 Presumably, the reason for the creation of those books is to miss the teaching of those original books
 in nai pali atthakathaon ke karta acharya buddhaghosh kaa naam pali sahitya main bahut prasiddh he
 Among the Sinhalese chronicles he has mentioned and whose incarnations he has taken in his fables, the main ones are- antim chaar atthakathaayen nikaayon athwa unke kinhin vishyon ke vishesh vyaakhyaan ke rup main prathit hote hai
 In the absence of these original chronicles, it is difficult to say to what extent Buddhaghosha imitated them and how radically they did, however it seems clear from looking at his compositions that he has given the original choreography by his vast knowledge of Tripitaka
 Must have flourished
 unki atthakathaayen vinayapitak, suttapitak evam abhidhammpitak ke adhikansh bhaagon par milti hai, jinaki sankhya 16 he
 Apart from these eight stories, there is a specific composition of Buddhaghosha, Visuddhimagga, which can be called the enlightenment of Buddhist philosophy
 atthakathaon main swayan buddhaghosh ke kathananusaar unhone visuddhimagg main digh, majjhim, sanyutt or angutar in chaaron nikaayon kaa saar bhar diya he
 According to the dictated tradition, he had written Visuddhimagga to prove his mettle before his works
 is granth main kul 23 pariched hai
 The subject of the first two passages is "samadhi" and the remaining verses discuss "pragya"
 buddhaghosh ke pashchaat atthakathaon kii parampara ko unke praaia: samasamyik do aacharyon buddhadutt or dhammpal ne paripusht kiya
 Buddhadatta summarized Vinayapitaka's story titled Samudhapasadika, Buddhaghosha, in his post-scripture and Vinayavinchashya, and composed a prose-verse-compound text called Abhidhammavatara based on Buddhaghosa's Abhidhamma choreography
 isamen moulikta yah he ki jahaan buddhaghosh ne rup, vednadi paanch skandhon ke dwaara dharmon kaa vivechan kiya he, vahaan buddhadutt ne chittar, chetsik, rup or nirvana is chaar prakaar ke vargeekaran ko apanaaya he
 He has kept this same classification in his composition named as Vibhag
 buddhadutt kii ek or rachana he madhuratth vilasini, jo buddhawans kii atthkatha he
 Dhammapala has written seven books
 khuddakanikaay ke antargat jin udaan, itishuttak, vimaanavtthu, petavatthu, thergatha, therigatha ev chariapitak naamak granthon par buddhaghosh ne atthakathaayen nahin likhin, unpar dhammpal ne paramatthdipani naamak atthkatha likhi he
 Likewise wrote the commentary called Atathasvanna on Nettikaran and the commentary called Leenatthvannana on the same, Paramatthamunjusha on Visuddhimagga, Lekanthapakasini on the fables of the four bodies of Buddhaghosha, the commentary on the Jatakattakatha and the commentary of Buddhaattatta
 in sab rachanaaon main sabase adhik prasiddh he unki visuddhimagg kii tikaa

 is rachana kaa upyog buddhaghosh ne apni atthakathaon main prachurtaa se kiya he or kahin-kahin uske avataran bhi die hai

 sinhal ke raajaaon ke saath-saath yahan buddha ke jivan, unke shishyon kii parampara evam teenon sangitiyon aadi kaa vivaran kuch badha chadhaakar kiya gaya he

 yah rachana pali-gadhy-mishrit he, style bahut kuch shithil he, punaruktiyaan bhi bahut he or rachana bhashaa, chand aadi ke dosha se mukt nahin he

 This book is also a symbol of how the Pali language was kept alive in Lanka for the said long period and the stream of literary work was never allowed to dry up in it
 dipavansh or mahavansh rachanaaon ne teevr aitihaasik vritti jaagrath kii
 As a result, many other books called the dynasty were composed
 isamen aitihaasik tathy to praaia: ukt donon granthon se hi liye gaye hai, kintu unamem jo naanaa vishyon kii shrutiparampara ko ekatra kar diya gaya he, vah mahatvapurn he
 In order to give importance to the subject, a lot of exaggerations and fantasies have also been taken shelter, due to which the historian starts to develop excitement or insolence
 is prakaar kii mukhya rachanaayen ye hai - In the above texts, for the most part, the ancient Tripitaka, their stories and the dialogue under Mahavansh is merely a repetition or elaboration

 According to the Indian Constitution, the Prime Minister is the head of the Council of Ministers of the Central Government and the Chief Advisor to the President
 vah bharat sarkaar ke karypalika kaa pramukh hota he or sarkaar ke kaaryon ke prati sansad ko javabdeh hota he
 In the parliamentary political system of India, the post of head of state and head of government has been completely divided
 saidhantikrup main samvidhan bharat ke raashtrapati ko desh kaa rashtrapramukh ghoshit karata he or saidhantikrup main, shashantantr kii sari shaktiyon ko raashtrapati par nihit karata he
 And the Constitution also specifies that the President shall exercise these rights on the advice of his subordinate officers
 samvidhan dwaara raashtrapati ke saare kaaryakari adhikaron ko prayog karne kii shakti, loktantric rup se nirvaachit, pradhanmantri ko di gayi he
 The constitution sets out the constitutional rights and duties of the Prime Minister in various Articles of its Part 5
 bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 74 main spasht rup se mantriparishad kii adhyakshata tathaa sanchaalan hetu pradhanmantri kii upasthiti ko aavashyak mana gaya he
 In the event of his death or resignation, the entire council has to step down
 vah swechha se hi mantriparishad kaa gathan karata he
 The President appoints the Minister on his advice only
 mantri gana ke vibhaag kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 The function of the cabinet also does the same
 desh ke prashasan ko nirdesh bhi vahi detaa he tathaa sabhi nitigat nirnay bhi vahi letaa he
 The link between the President and the Council of Ministers is also the same
 mantriparishad kaa pradhan pravaktaa bhi vahi he
 He leads parliamentary debates in the name of the ruling party
 sansad me mantriparishad ke paksh me ladi ja rahi kisi bhi bahes me vah bhaag le saktaa he
 The coordination between ministers also does the same
 vah kisi bhi mantralay se koi bhi soochna aavashyaktaanusaar mangava saktaa he
 The Prime Minister is the leader of the majority party in the Lok Sabha, and is appointed by the President of India to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha
 is pad par kisi prakaar kii samay-seemaa nirdhaarit nahin kii gai he parantu ek vyakti is pad par keval tab tak rah saktaa he jabatak loksabhaa main bahumat uske paksh main ho
 The constitution, in particular, gives the Prime Minister full control over the Union Cabinet
 is pad ke padaadhikari ko sarkari tantra par di gayi atyadhik niyantranaatmak shakti, pradhanmantri ko bhartiya ganraajya kaa sabase shaktishaalee or prabhaavshaalee vyakti banaati he
 Being the leader of a nuclear-armed state, including the world's seventh-largest economy, the second-largest population, the largest democracy, and the world's third-largest military forces, the Indian Prime Minister is counted among the world's most powerful and influential figures
 varsh 2010 main fors patrika ne apni, vishwa ke sabase shaktishaalee logon kii, suchi main tatkaaleen pradhanmantri manmohan singh ko 18veen sthaan par rakhaa tha tathaa 2012 or 2013 main unhen kramshah 19wein or 28wein sthaan par rakhaa tha
 His successor, Narendra Modi, was named 15th in the year 2014 and 9th most powerful person in the world in the year 2015
 is pad kii sthapana, varttman kartavyon or shaktiyon ke saath, 26 janvari 1947 main, samvidhan ke parvartan ke saath hui thi
 From that time till the present time, a total of 15 office bearers have served on this post
 is pad par niyukt hone vaale pehle padaadhikari jawaharlal nehru the jabaki bharat ke vartmaan pradhanmantri narendra modi hai, jinhen 26 may 2014 ko is pad par niyukt kiya gaya tha
 The Constitution-makers of India influenced the Indian political system to form a parliamentary republic, influenced by the Westminster system, in which the positions of head of state and head of state were completely divided
 bhartiya rajnatik pranali main pradhanmantri kaa pad samvidhan dwaara sthapit shashanpramukh kaa pad he, jisapar saarvbhaumik vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par prajatantrik rup se nirvaachit vyakti ko niyukt kiya jaataa he
 At the same time, the post of the President of India is the post of the President of the Republic of India, who are elected indirectly by the Parliament
 pradhanmantri kaa pad nihsandeh bhartiya rajnatik pranali kaa sabase shaktishaalee evam varchasvpurn pad he
 The Prime Minister ultimately has control over all activities and policies of the Federal Government and the Union Cabinet
 kendriya mantriyon kii niyukti va nishkasana bhi antytah pradhanmantri hi karte hai
 However, the Prime Minister cannot do the appointment, expulsion and other such functions of the ministers themselves
 mantriyon kii niyukti va nishkasana raashtrapati dwaara pradhanmantri ke salaah par hota he
 The Constitution of India respectively promulgates a number of legislations that have legally ensured that in normal circumstances, in the case of the executive, the President should have only nominal powers, while the actual powers are in the hands of the Prime Minister
 samvidhan ne pradhanmantri or raashtrapati kii shaktiyon ko bhaag 5 ke vibhinn anuchhedon main kuch is prakaar ankit kiya gaya he: Generally, the Prime Minister is appointed by the President on the basis of the result of the parliamentary general election
 pradhanmantri, loksabhaa main bahumat-dhari dal ke netaa hote hai
 Although the Prime Minister does not have to be a Lok Sabha MP himself, he has to prove his majority in the Lok Sabha and become a member of Parliament within six months of his appointment
 pradhanmantri sansad ke donon sadanon main se kisi bhi ek sadan ke sadsy ho sakate hai
 Historically, there have been many Prime Ministers who were Rajya sabha-mps; In 1966, Indira Gandhi, Deve Gowda and more recently Manmohan Singh, were Rajya sabha-mps
 prayek chunaav pashchaat, naveen sabha kii baithak main bahumat daal ke netaa ke chunaav ke baad, raashtrapati, bahumat-dhari dal ke netaa ko pradhanmantri banane hetu aamantrit karte hai, aamantran sweekaar karne ke pashchaat, sambandhit vyakti ko loksabhaa main matdaan dwaara vishwasamat praapt karnaa hota he
 Thereafter the order of confidence is passed on to the President, after which the Prime Minister and other ministers are administered the oath of office and they are appointed as Prime Ministers at a ceremony
 yadi koi ek dal yaa gathbandhan, loksabhaa main bahumat praapt karne main aksham hota he, to, yah purnatah mahamahim raashtrapati ke vivek par nirbhar hota he ki ve kis vyakti ko pradhanmantripad praapt karne hetu aamantrit karen
 Such a situation is called a state of hung assembly
 trishanku sabha kii sthiti main raashtrapati saadharantah sabase bade dal ke netaa ko nimnasadan main bahumat siddh karne hetu aamantrit karte he
 It is mandatory for a person who accepts the invitation to prove his trust in the Lok Sabha and only then can that person be appointed Prime Minister
 aitihaasik taur par, is visheshadhikaar kaa prayog anek avasaron par vibhinn raashtrapatigan kar chuke hai
 After the resignation of Prime Minister Morarji Desai by President Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy in 1977, Chaudhary Charan Singh was appointed Prime Minister, exercising this same privilege
 iske alaava bhi is visheshadhikaar kaa upyog kar, raashtrapatigan ne 1989 main rajeev gandhi or vishwanath pratap singh, 1991 main narsingh raav tathaa 1996 or 1998 main atal bihari vaajapeyi ko pradhanmantripad par niyukt karne ke liye kiya he
 The cabinet is made up of ministers selected by the Prime Minister and appointed by the President
 bhartiya samvidhan, pradhanmantri pad hetu kisi prakaar kii vishesh arhataayen nirdisht nahin karata he
 But one need has been fixed: the Prime Minister should have the membership of Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha, and they should have majority support in Lok Sabha
 yadi niyukti ke samay paatr, bhartiya sansad ke do sadanon main se kisi bhi sadan kaa sadsy nahin hota he to niyukti ke 6 maheenon ke madhya hi unhen sansad kii sadsyta praapt karnaa anivaary he anyathaa unka pradhanmantritv khaarij ho jaayegaa
 Therefore, the claimant to the Prime Minister must have all the qualifications to be an MP
 bhartiya samvidhan ke pancham bhaag kaa 84vaan anuchhed, ek saansad kii arhataaon ko nirdisht karata he, uske anusaar: a person shall be qualified to be elected to fill a place in Parliament only when— jaisaa ki tisare bindu main vinirdisht he, paatr ko sansad dwaara bhavishya main paarit paatrata ke kisi bhi yogayata par khara utaarna hoga tathaa kyonki pradhanmantri kaa saansad hona anivaary he, atah pradhanmantritv ke paatr ko loksabhaa yaa rajyasabha kaa sadsy hone yogya hone hetu, kuch anya arhataaon par bhi khara utarana hota he, jinamein uskaa vikrut charitra vaala vyakti yaa diwalia ghoshit naa hona, swechha se kisi videshi rajya kii naagarikta praapt kar lenaa, kisi nyaayalay dwaara uskaa nirvachan shunya ghoshit kar diya janaa, tathaa raashtrapati yaa rajyapal niyukt hona shaamil hai
 Also, an eligible person should not be an employee of any beneficial post in the service of any office and administrative or non-administrative body under the Central Government, any State Government or any of the aforesaid Government
 saath hi sadan se prastaav-sweekrut nishkasana se bhi paatr kii sadsyta samaapt ho jaati he
 After the appointment, the Prime Minister's disqualification, on any of the foregoing qualifications, is proved in a legal court, then the election of that person is declared void, and he is expelled from the post of Prime Minister
 
 pradhanmantri ko pad kii shapath raashtrapati dwaara dilaai jaati he
 For appointment to the post, the prospective officer is required to take two oaths
 ye donon shapath bhartiya samvidhan kii teesri anusuchee main vinirdisht hai, 99, 124, 148, 164, 188 or 219): Types of Pledge or Affirmation: 1 mantripad kii shapath kaa praaroop : 2 Form of Oath of Privacy: saiddhanthik rupatah, padasth pradhanmantri, "raashtrapati ke prasadparyant", apane pad par bana rahata he
 Unlike the President, no time limit has been set for the Prime Minister's term
 atah ek padasth pradhanmantri anishchit kaal tak pradhanmantripad par bana rah saktaa he, basharte ki raashtrapati ko usapar "vishwaas" ho
 The real meaning of this is that a person can hold the post of Prime Minister only as long as the majority in the Lok Sabha is in his favor
 baharhaal, loksabhaa kaa puraa kaarykaal 5 varsh hota he, jiske baad nae chunaav karaaye jate hai, or naveen sabha punah pradhanmantri ke paksh main vishwasamat paarit karti he, yadi nav-nirvaachit sabha pradhanmantri main avishvaas ghoshit kar detii he to phir pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal samaapt ho jaataa he
 Therefore, it can be said that the Prime Minister has a full term of 5 years, after which he is reviewed again
 baharhaal, pradhanmantri kaa kaarykaal 5 varshon se purv hi samaapt ho saktaa he, yadi kisi karanvash, loksabhaa sarkaar ke virodh main avishvaas mat paarit kare athwa yadi kisi karanvash, pradhanmantri kii sansad kii sadsyta shunaya ghoshit ho jaae to pradhanmantri, kisi bhi samay, apane pad kaa tyaag, raashtrapati ko ek likhit tyaagptr saunp ke kar sakate hai
 Prime Minister Morarji Desai was the first Prime Minister of the country to relinquish his office during his tenure
 pradhanmantri ke kaarykaal par naa hi kisi prakaar kii samay-seemaa he naa koi aayu seemaa nirdisht kii gai he
 India Gateway bhartiya samvidhan ke anuchhed 74 main spasht rup se mantriparishad kii adhyakshata tathaa sanchaalan hetu pradhanmantri kii upasthiti aavashyak maanata he
 In the event of his death or resignation, the entire council has to step down
 vah akele hi mantri parishad kaa gathan karata he
 The President appoints the Minister on his advice only
 mantri gana ke vibhaag kaa nirdhaaran bhi vahi karata he
 The function of the cabinet also does the same
 desh ke prashasan ko nirdesh bhi vahi detaa he
 All policy decisions are taken by him
 raashtrapati tathaa mantri parishad ke madhyasampark sutara bhi vahi he
 He is also the principal spokesman of the Council of Ministers
 vah parishad ke naam se ladi jane vaali sansadeey bahason kaa netritv karata he
 He can participate in any debate being fought in favor of the Council in Parliament
 mantri gana ke madhya samanvay bhi vahi karata he
 He can ask for any information from any ministry
 in sab karnow ke chalate pradhanmantri ko bharat kaa sabase mahatvapurn rajnatik vyaktitv mana jaataa he
 The most important reason for the dominance and importance of the Indian Prime Minister is the executive powers conferred on his office bearers
 samvidhan kaa anuchhed 74 pradhanmantri ke pad ko sthapit karata he, evam yah nirdisht karata he ki ek mantriparishad hogi jiskaa mukhiya pradhanmantri hoga, jo bharat ke raashtrapati ko "salaah or sahaayta" pradaan karenge
 And Article 75 establishes that the appointment of ministers will be done by the President as per the advice of the Prime Minister, and the minister will also be given various assignments as per the advice of the President, Prime Minister
 atah samvidhan yah nirdisht karata he kii, jahaan sanvaidhanik kaaryakari adhikaar bharat ke raashtrapati ke paas he, parantu kyonki in sambandhon main bharat ke raashtrapati keval pradhanmantri kii salaahnusaar kaary karte hai, atah vaastavik rup se, in kaaryakari adhikaron kaa prayog pradhanmantri apni icchaanusaar karte hai
 The constitution establishes by these legislations that as the head of the nation of India, the Prime Minister shall exercise all the executive powers vested indirectly, and will be the head of the entire Council of Ministers and constitution of the Council of Ministers by Article 75, appointment of ministers
 And his assignment has also been left to the will of the Prime Minister, but also the ministers and ministers
 The Constitution, the Prime Minister in relation to schools provides complete freedom
 pradhanmantri, apane mantrimandal main kisi bhi vyakti ko shaamil kar sakate he, nikaal sakate he, niyukt kar sakate hai yaa nilambit karvaa sakate hai
 Since ministers are appointed by the President only on the advice of the Prime Minister, it means that the Council of Ministers is actually created by people of the Prime Minister's choice, in which they can change at any time of their choice
 saath hi mantriyon ko vibhinn kaarybhaar pradaan karnaa bhi purnatah pradhanmantri kii ichha par nirbhar karata he; ve apane mantriyon main se kisi ko bhi koi bhi mantralay yaa kaarybhaar saunp sakati hai, chin sakate hai yaa doosraa koi kaarybhaar / mantralay saunp sakate hai
 In these cases there is no constitutional obligation of any kind to the Prime Minister to consult the ministers concerned, or to obtain their permission
 balki mantriyon va mantralayon ke vishay main purvakthith kisi bhi maamle main sambandhit mantri yaa mantriyon kii salaah yaa anumati praapt karne kii, pradhanmantri par kisi bhi prakaar kii sanvaidhanik baadhyataa nahin he
 They can also ask any minister to resign from the minister any time they want, and if that minister refuses to resign, they can ask the president to suspend him from office
 mantriyon kii niyukti evam mantralayon ke aavnton ke alaava, mantrimandaleey sabhaayen, cabinet kii gatividhiyaan or sarkaar kii nitiyon par bhi pradhanmantri kaa puraa niyantran hota he
 The Prime Minister is the constitutional head and leader of the Council of Ministers
 ve sansad evam anya manchon par mantriparishad kaa pratinidhitiv karte he
 They preside over cabinet meetings, and decide the agenda of these meetings, and other topics of discussion
 balki cabinet baithkon main uthne vaale saare maamle va vishaysoochee, pradhanmantri kii hi sweekruti va sahmati se nirdhaarit kiye jate hai
 It is at the will of the Prime Minister to approve or reject various proposals that arise in cabinet meetings
 haalaanki, charchaa karne or apane nijee suzav va prastaavon ko baithak ke samaksh rakhane kii swatantraaa har mantri ko he, parantu antytah vahi prastaav yaa nirnay liya jaataa he, jisapar pradhanmantri kii sahmati ho or nirnay paarit kiye jane ke pashchaat use puure mantriparishad kaa antim nirnay mana jaataa he, or sabhi mantriyon ko pradhanmantri ke us nirnay ke saath chalanaa hota he
 Therefore, it can be said that as a constitutionally, the Prime Minister has complete control and unchallenged dominance over the Union Cabinet
 niyantran ke maamle main pradhanmantri, mantriparishad kaa sarvesarva hota he, or uske istife se puri sarkaar gir jaati he, arthath saare mantriyon kaa mantritv samaapt ho jaataa he
 Apart from the chairmanship of the Council of Ministers, the Constitution vests another special privilege on the Prime Minister, this privilege being the mid-contact thread between the Council of Ministers and the President
 yah visheshadhikaar keval pradhanmantri ko diya gaya he, jiske madhyam se pradhanmantri samay-samay par, raashtrapati ko mantrisabha main liye jane vaale nirnay or charchaaon se sambandhit jaankaree se raashtrapati ko adhishuchet karaate rahete hai
 No minister other than the Prime Minister can voluntarily reveal to the President any of the subjects discussed in the Council
 yah visheshadhikaar kii mahatv va arth yah he kii mantrimandaleey sabhaaon main charchit vishyon main se kin jaankariyon ko gopneey rakhana he, evam kin jaankariyon ko duniya ke saamne prastut karnaa he, yah tay karne kaa adhikaar bhi pradhanmantri ke paas he
 The Prime Minister works as the Chief Manager of the various organs of the state, whose job is to get all the departments and organs of the state to do the work as they wish
 sarkaar ke vibhinn vibhaagon or mantralayon ke bich samanvay bananaa, or cabinet dwaara liye gaye nirnyon ko karyanvit karwaanaa tathaa vibhinn vibhaagon ko nirdeshit karnaa bhi unka kaam he
 It is also their job to resolve administrative differences between ministries and departments and take final decisions
 sarkari kaaryon ke karyanvayan ke alaava bhi, sarkari tantra par pradhanmantri kaa atyadhik prabhaav or pakad hota he
 Being the head of government and government, all the executive appointments are actually made by the Prime Minister
 saare ucchstareey adhikari va padaadhikari pradhanmantri, apane pasand ke hi niyukt karte hai
 These appointments include high-advisors and high officials of government ministries and offices, governors of various states, attorney generals, auditors, overlords of public service commissions, and other members, ambassadors of various countries, consulars, etc
 yah saare ucchstareey niyuktiyaan, bharat ke raashtrapati dwaara, pradhanmantri kii salaah par kiye jate hai
 Being the head of the government and the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister is the leader of the majority and the leader of the ruling house and the principal representative in the Lok Sabha
 is sandarbh main, sadan main sarkaar or sattapaksh kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa pradhanmantri kaa karttavya mana jaataa he
 At the same time it is expected that the Prime Minister will make important bills and announcements taken by the government in the House and the Prime Minister will answer from the ruling side about those important decisions
 loksabhaa adhyaksh kaa chunaav, nirvachan dwaara hota he, atah saadharantah, sabhapati bhi bahumat daal kaa hota he
 Therefore, being the leader of the majority of pulses, through the Speaker, the Prime Minister also has the ability to influence the proceedings of the Lok Sabha in a limited way, as the Chairman is the Speaker of the House, and the Chairman also determines the table of contents in the House
 However, the action of the House cannot be affected to a greater extent
 in kartavyon ke alaava, sansadeey karrwai ko par pradhanmantri kaa sabase mahatvapurn shakti he, loksabhaa satr bulaane or satrant karne kii shakti
 Article 85 of the constitution gives the President of India the right to call and end the session of the Lok Sabha, but in this case the President has to act according to the advice of the Prime Minister
 arthath vaastavikrupe, loksabhaa kaa satr bulaanaa or ant karnaa pradhanmantri ke haathon main hota he
 This right is, undoubtedly, the most important right given in the hands of the Prime Minister, which gives him an opportunity to have limited control not only on his party but also on the activities of the opposition mps
 sarkaar or desh ke netaa hone ke naate, vaishvik manch par bharat kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa pradhanmantri kii sabase mahatvapurn zimmedaariyon main se ek he
 The Prime Minister has the most important role in determining the global policy of the Indian state, due to his immense control over the government and the Council of Ministers
 desh kii videsh niti se sambandhit nirnay, desh kii samrik, kootnithik, aarthik, vanijyik ityadi aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar aamtaur par mantriparishad main charchaa dwaara nirdhaarit kii jaati he, jiname antim nirnay pradhanmantri lete hai
 The Ministry of External Affairs of India handles global relations and related matters, for which an independent cabinet minister is also appointed in the name of the foreign minister, but because foreign policies, etc
, the Prime Minister determines, therefore, the Foreign Minister is ultimately decided by the Prime Minister
 Implements the decisions and policies taken
 vibhinn deshon se samrik, aarthik, kootnithik, vanijyik or sansadhanik, ityadi sandhiyaan or samjhaute, tathaa unase judi kootnithik bahes or vaartaon main pradhanmantri kaa kirdaar sabase mahatvapurn hota he, or aisi vaartaon main ve desh kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 It is also the responsibility of the Prime Minister to welcome and host the Heads of State and Delegations of various countries
 videshi pratinidhiyon kii mezbaani ke alawa, pradhanmantri, janpratinidhi va shashanpramukh hone ke naate, videshon main bharat kaa pratinidhitiv bhi karte hai
 He represents India in international organizations such as United Nations, G20, BRICS, SAARC, non-aligned Movement, Commonwealth, etc
, and stands for India
 antarrashtriya manch par desh kii chhavi banane, or kootnithik vaartaon dwaara desh ke hit kii aapurti karne main pradhanmantri kaa sthaan behad mahatvapurn he
 The Constitution of India, being the head of the national head and all strategic forces, gives the President of India the right to declare war and peace from any other country, but its real authority lies with the Prime Minister, because according to the advice of the Prime Minister in this matter Are bound to work yuddh kii ghoshnaa ke alaava, yuddh kii ranneeti nirdhaarit karnaa tathaa samrik balon ko niyantrit karnaa bhi pradhanmantri dwaara hi hota he tathaa shanti-ghoshnaa karnaa or shanti-samjhauta karnaa bhi pradhanmantri kaa karttavya he
 There are some special, sensitive and high-level departments and ministries of the Government of India, which are not assigned to any minister other than the Prime Minister due to their specialty, sensitivity or any other reason
 in vibhinn vibhaagon ke kaaryon ke prati ve sansad ko javabdeh he, or aavashyaktaa padane par unhen sansad main puche gaye prashno kaa uttar dena padataa he
 Generally, the Prime Minister is in charge of these following departments: bharat ke pradhanmantripad ke rajnatik mahatva evam uske padaadhikari kii jananaayak or rashtriya netritvkarta kii chhavi ke lihaaz se, pradhanmantri pad ke padaadhikari se yah aashaa kii jaati he, ki ve bharat ke janamanas ko bhalee-bhanti jane, samajhen evam raashtra ko uchit disha pradaan karen
 Being the representative of the public, the Prime Minister has had an important traditional and symbolic character in important national days and celebrations
 samay ke saath, pradhanmantri par anek paranmaragat karttavya viksit hue hai
 Prominent among these duties is the Prime Minister's address to the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort in Delhi every year on the occasion of Independence Day
 swatatranta pashchaat, varsh 1947 se hi yah parampara chali aa rahi he, jisamen, pradhanmantri, swayan dilli ke aitihaasik laal qile kii pracheer par, rashtriya dhvaj fahraate hai or janata ko sambodhit karte hai
 In these speeches, usually the Prime Ministers highlight the achievements of the government in the past year, and make them directly aware of the agenda and mood of the government in the coming years
 15 agast, varsh 1947 ko sarvapratham, bharat ke pratham pradhanmantri, jawaharlal nehru ne laal kile kii pracheer se desh ko sambodhit kiya tha
 He continued this tradition of addressing the public from the Red Fort during his 17-year tenure
 tatpashchaat, unke dwaara shuru kii gayi is parampara ko unke prayek uttaradhikari ne barkaar rakhaa he, or yah parampara aaj tak chali aa rahi he
 At the present time, the Prime Minister's speech is considered one of the most important political events of the year, in which the Prime Minister himself directly presents to the public the achievements and mood of the government
