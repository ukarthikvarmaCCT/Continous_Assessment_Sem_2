 Geomorphology is studied in geography, geology, geodesy, engineering geology, archeology and geotechnical engineering and this broad base of interest generates a wide variety of research styles and interests under the subject
 prithvi kii sataha, prakritik or manvodbhav vigyaan sambandhi prakriyaaon ke sangyojan kii pratikriya swaroop vikaas karti he or saamagree jodne vaali or use hataane vaali prakriyaaon ke bich santulan ke saath jawaab detii he
 Such processes can operate at different scales of place and time
 sarvaadhik vyapak paimaane par, bhu-drishy kaa nirmaan vivartanik utthan or jwalamukhi ke madhyam se hota he
 Degradation is caused by erosion and extensive waste, creating sediment that is transported and deposited to other locations within the landscape or away from the coast
 uttarottar chote paimaane par, isi tarah kii avadharana lagu hoti he, jahaan ikai bhu-akritiyaan yogashil or ghataav prakriyaaon ke santulan ke jawaab main viksit hoti hai
 Modern geomorphology is the study of the divergence of the flow of material on the surface of a planet and is therefore closely associated with sedimentology, which can similarly be seen as the convergence of that flow
 bhu-akritik prakriyaayein vivartaniki, jalwaayu, paristhitiki, or maanav gatividhiyon se prabhavit hoti hai or samaan rup se inamen se kai kaarak dharti kii sataha par chal rahe vikaas se prabhavit ho sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye, isostacy yaa parvatiy varshan ke madhyam se
 Many geomorphologists take particular interest in the possibility of feedback between climate and tectonics that mediate geomorphic processes
 bhu-akruti vigyaan ke vyaavhaarik anuprayog main shaamil he sankat akalan jisamen shaamil he bhuskhalan purvanumaan or shaman, nadi niyantran or punarsthapana or tateey sangrakshan
 With a few notable exceptions, geomorphology is a relatively new science, which has been growing with interest in other aspects of geology since the mid-19th century
 is khand main kuch pramukh akritiyon or unke vikaas kii ghatnaon ke bare main ek sankshipt ruparekha pradaan kii gai he
 The polytheistic Chinese scientist and politician Shen Kuo was perhaps the earliest to discover a theory of geomorphology
 yah prashanth mahaasaagar se saikadon mile kii duuri par ek pahaad ke bhuvaigyanik parat main samudri jeevashm ke khol ke uske avlokan par aadhaarit he
 When he saw the bicolor shell moving in a horizontal extension toward the erosion section of the cliff, he theorized that the reef was once the location of a pre-historic period seaward that moved hundreds of miles over the course of several centuries
 usne nishkarsh nikaala ki vah bhoomi pahaado kii mrudaa kataav or gaad ke jamaav ke kaaran bhinn rup main punargathit hui

 The first use of the term geomorphology was probably in German, when it appeared in Laumann's 1858 works

je
 micgi ne is shabd kaa istemaal 1891 ke antarrashtriya bhuvaigyanik sammelan main kiya to yah angreji, german or french main saamaanya upyog main aa gaya
 An early popular geomorphic model was the geographic cycle or erosion cycle developed by William Morris Davis between 1884 and 1899
 yah chakra ekarupathavaad ke siddhanton se prerit tha jise sarvapratham james haton ne prastaavit kiya tha
 In relation to valley-like shapes, uniformism characterized this cycle in a sequence in which a river cuts a valley as deep as possible, but then the erosion of the side basins eventually recovers the area and reduces elevation Gives, after which regeneration can resume that cycle

 Davis's ideas have largely been surpassed today, mainly because of his lack of predictive ability and qualitative nature, but he remains an extremely important figure in the history of the subject
 1920 ke dashak main, walter penk ne davis ke model kaa ek vaikalpik model viksit kiya, yah maanate hue ki sthalakriti vikaas ko utthan or anaachhadan kii satat prakriyaaon ke bich santulan ke rup main behatar paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, naa ki davis ke ekal utthan ke baad hone vaale kshay ke rup main
 However, due to his untimely death at a relatively young age, the controversy with Davis and the lack of an English translation of his works did not gain widespread recognition for many years
 in lekhakon ne prithvi kii sataha ke vikaas ke adhyayan ko, pehle kii tulana main adhik saamanyakrit, vishwa str par praasangik aadhaar dene kaa prayaas kiya
 In the early 19th century, authors - particularly in Europe - attributed the local climate to landforms, and specifically to glaciation and periglacial processes
 iske vipareet, davis or penk, donon ne hi samay ke saath hone vaale bhudrishy vikaas ke mahatv or alag-alag paristhitiyon main alag-alag bhu-drishyon par prithvi kii satahi prakriyaaon kii saamanyata par jor dene kaa prayaas kiya
 While Pank and Davis and their followers were writing and studying primarily in Western Europe, another, largely segregated school of geomorphology developed in the United States in the mid-20th century

 These methods began to allow predictions regarding the behavior of past and future landscapes based on current assessments and later evolved into quantitative geomorphology or geomorphometry
 aaj, bhu-akruti vigyaan ke kshetra main alag-alag drushtikonon or hiton kii ek bahut vyapak seemaa shaamil he
 Modern researchers try to derive quantitative "theories" that govern the Earth's surface processes, but equally, they recognize the specificity of each landscape and environment in which these processes operate
 samakaleen bhu-akruti vigyaan main vishesh mahatvapurn pratiti main shaamil hai: Modern geomorphology focuses on quantitative analysis of interrelated processes
 bhu-rasayan main aadhunik pragati, vishesh rup se cosmochemistry, isotope bhu-rasayan or fishan trek dating ne hamen pehali baar un daron ke maapan main sakasham banaaya he jis par bhu-akritik prakriyaayein, bhugarbheey rup se praasangik samayrekha par ghatit hoti hai
 At the same time, the use of more accurate physical measurement techniques, including piercing GPS, remotely sensed digital terrain models, and laser scanning techniques have allowed their quantification and study of these processes
 iske baad computer simulation or modelling kaa upyog tab yah samajhane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he ki kaise ye prakriyaayein ek saath or samyavadhi main kaam karti hai
 Most processes that are geologically relevant can be considered either erosive, translational, or a combination of the two
 Deposition processes are mostly considered within the field of sedimentology, but are often understood as part of geomorphology as well
 apkshay, prithvi kii saamagree kaa vayumandaleey yaa sataha ke nazadiiki agenton se sampark ke kaaran hone vaala rasinic or bhautik vighatan he
 The products of these changes near the surface can later be carried away by various factors of erosion
 bhu-vaigyanik dwaara jaanch kii jane vaali prakriyaaon kii prakruti, drudh rup se jaanch main shaamil bhudrishy yaa sthalakriti par or samay or lambaai rekha kii ruchi par nirbhar he
 However, the following non-detailed list provides a glimpse of the landscape elements associated with some of these
 praathmik satahi prakriyaayein jo adhikansh sthalakritik swaroopon ke liye jimmedaar he, usamen shaamil he hawa, lahar, rasinic vighatan, jan vinaash, bhoojal gatividhi, satahi jal pravaah, him karrwai, vivartaniki or jwalamukhi
 Other more serious geomorphic processes may include periglacial processes, salt-mediated action, or extraterrestrial effects
 nadiyaan or dharaaen, keval pani kii hi vaahak nahin hai balki talachat kii bhi hai
 Water, when flowing over the surface, is able to use sediments and carry them downstream, either as bottom load or suspended load, or as dissolved load
 talachat parivahan kii dar, swayan talachat kii uplabdhta or nadi ke nirvahan par nirbhar karti he
 Rivers are also capable of eroding new rocks and creating new sediments, by their bottom and coupling with the surrounding mountain slopes
 In this way, rivers are thought to be responsible for establishing the base level for large-scale landscapes in non-glacial environments
 vibhinn bhudrishy tatwon ke sampark main nadiyaan mahatvapurn sutara hai
 When rivers flow through topographies, they generally become larger in size and merge with other rivers
 is prakaar gathit nadiyon kaa network ek apvaah tantra he or aksar vrikshnuma hota he, lekin antarnihit bhuvigyaan or sthaneey sthalakriti ke aadhaar par anya swaroop bhi dhaaran kar saktaa he
 Eolian processes are related to the movement of air and, more specifically, to the ability of Hava to shape the Earth's surface
 Winds can erode, transport, and deposit things, and these winds are more effective in areas where vegetation is sparse and there is an adequate supply of sediment
 haalanki pani or brihat pravaah, adhikansh vaataavaran main hawa kii tulana main adhik chizon kaa istemaal karata he, vaiudh prakriyaayein shushk vaataavaran main mahatvapurn hai, registan
 Soils, regoliths and boulders move under the influence of gravity, crawling, rolling, flowing, falling
 aisi brihad tuutan sthaliy or dhalaanon par hoti he or inhen prithvi, mangal shukr, titan or iapets par dekha gaya he
 Processes running on mountain slopes can change the topology of the slope surface, which in turn can change the rates of those processes
 aisi dhalaane jo najuk sthiti tak gahari ho jaati hai ve badi maatra main saamagree ko jaldi-jaldi chhodane main sakasham ho jaati hai, jisase dhalaani prakriya vivartanik rup se sakriy kshetron main bhudrishy kaa ek mahatvapurn tatva ban jaati hai
 On Earth, biological processes such as digging or tree throws can play an important role in determining the rates of some sloping processes
 himandi, jo ki bhugolic rup se simit he, bhudrishy parivartan ke prabhavi kaarak hai
 The gradual movement of snow down the valley causes friction and uprooting of the rock below
 gharshan se maheen talachat kaa nirmaan hota he, jise himand aataa kehete hai
 The debris transported by the glacier after it is finished is called Moren
 himand kataav, you aakaar kii ghaatiyon ke liye jimmedaar he, jo ki nadi dwaara banaai gai ve aakaar kii ghaatiyon ke vipareet he
 The way glaciers process contact with other landscape elements, especially with slopes and river processes, is an important aspect of plio-pleistocene landscape development and its sediments are found in many high mountain environments
 jo vaataavaran apekshaakrit haal hi main himachhadit hue hai magar ab nahin hai, ve un bhudrushyon ke mukaable jo kabhi himachhadit nahin hue, ab bhi ucch bhudrishy parivartan dar ko dikhaa sakate hai
 Non-glacial geomorphic processes that have also been adapted by earlier glaciation are called paraglacial processes
 yah avadharana, perigleshial prakriyaaon kii virodhabhasi he, jo barf yaa paale ke nirmaan yaa pighalaav dwaara sidhe sanchalit hoti he
 The tectonic effect on geomorphology can range from millions of years to a minute or less
 bhudrishy par vivartaniki kaa prabhaav baari rup se anternihit chattani aadhaaron kii banaavat par nirbhar karata he jo is baat ko niyantrit karata he ki vivartaniki kis prakaar kii sthaneey aakaariki ko janm degi
 Earthquakes, within minutes, can inundate vast terrain and give rise to wetlands
 isostetic paltaav ke kaaran saikadon yaa hazaron saal main mahatvapurn parivartan ho saktaa he or isse parvatiy shrinkhalaa ko atirikt kataav kii anumati milti he, kyonki shrinkhalaa se bade hisse ko hataa diya jaataa he or katibandh kaa utthan hota he
 Long-term plate tectonic dynamics induce orogenic tropics, massive mountain ranges with a million-year lifespan, which are the focus of high-rate processes of river and hill slopes, and thus produce long-term depressions
 gahari papadi gatishiltaa kii visheshtaayen, jaise ki plums or nimna sthalmandal kaa gaiyr-paratbandi ko bhi mana jaataa he ki dirghakaalin avadhi main dharti kii sthalakriti ke bade paimaane par vikaas main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he
 Both can induce regeneration through isostasy, as hot, low-density crust rocks displace the relatively cold, high-density crust rocks inside the earth
 jwalamukheey or vitaleey aagney prakriyaaon kaa bhu-akruti vigyaan par mahatvapurn prabhaav ho saktaa he
 The occurrence of the volcano renews the landscape and covers the old surface of the land with lava and tephra and releases pyroclastic material and leads the rivers to new paths
 visphoton dwaara nirmit shanku bhi paryaapt nai sthalakriti banaata he, jis par anya satahi prakriyaayein apana kaam kar sakati hai
 The subsurface activity of lava also plays a role in geomorphology
 sataha ke neeche chalata pighalaav jamini sataha kii sfiti or avasfiti kaa kaaran bana saktaa he or tibet ke neeche aanshik rup se pighali hui bhupatal parat ko hazaron kilometre par faile tibeti pathaar kii bhu-akruti ko niyantrit karne kaa yogadan diya gaya he
 The interaction of organisms with geomorphology or bio-geomorphic processes can occur in many forms and is probably quite important overall for terrestrial geomorphic systems
 jeev vigyaan, kai bhu-akritik prakriyaaon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he, jiskaa kshetra rasinic apkshay ko niyantrit karne vaali jaev bhu-rasinic prakriyaaon se lekar yantric prakriyaaon ke prabhaav tak he jaise mrudaa vikaas par khudaai or tree thro or yahaan tak ki vaishvik apradan dar ko carbon dioxide santulan ke madhyam se jalwaayu kaa aaparivartan karte hue niyantrit karnaa bhi isamen shaamil he
 Terrestrial landscapes that can certainly exclude the role of biology in mediating surface processes are extremely rare, but they can provide important information for understanding the geomorphology of other planets such as Mars Huh
 alag-alag sthanik or loukik paimaanon par alag-alag bhu-akritik prakriyaaon kaa prabhutv hota he
 In addition, the scales at which processes occur may dictate reactions or other forms of landscape changes to the motivating hair, such as climate or tectonics
 ye vichaar, aaj bhu-akruti vigyaan ke adhyayan ke liye mahatvapurn hai

 Going further than this, sometimes the words, names, analogies, metaphors, etc
, also speak of the existence of the soul
 sarvatmavaad kaa darshan mukhyatya adivasee samaajon main paaya jaataa he parantu yah shinto evam hinduon ke kuch sampradaayon main bhi paaya jaataa he
 There are often three types of beliefs or ideas prevalent among humans regarding soul, soul or organism
 kuch log to charvak ke anuyaayiyon kii tarah, shariron se swatantra yaa pruthak jeevon yaa atmaaon kii koi satta hi nahin maanate
 According to him, consciousness arises as a result of the actions of the root brain in the same way as bile from the liver; It is not a quality or form of a non-material element or substance called a creature or soul
 iske viruddh kuch logon ke vichaar main chetana bhautik tatwon se utpann nahin hoti, kintu bhautik padaarthon se vilakshan aatma yaa jeev kaa gun he
 For example, Jain thinkers, while acknowledging the independent existence of organisms, defined the organism in these words as "chetnlakshano Jeeva:"
 parantu aatma yaa jeev kii satta sweekaar karanevaale sab vyakti ek mat ke nahin
 They can be broadly divided into two classes
 ek to ve jo keval manushyon or kuch ucch koti ke pashupakshiyon main hi aatma kaa astitv sweekaar karte hai or duusare ve jo na keval manushyon or pashupakshiyon main hi apitu keet-patangon or ped-paudhon aadi main bhi, jinhen duusare log jad samajhate hai, aatma yaa jeev ke astitv par vishwaas karte hai
 This same type of belief or idea of human beings is called animism
 taarkik bhashaa main sarvatmavaad vah siddhant he jiske anusaar tathakthith jad padaarthon main bhi aatma yaa jeevatma namawale ek abhautik tatv yaa shakti kaa astitv sweekaar kiya jaataa he or use na keval buddhijivi praaniyon ke bauddhik jivan kaa apitu shaareerik athwa bhautik kriyaaon kaa bhi muladhar mana jaataa he
 As the Kāोपopanishad is from this shruti of "yonnyamnye Prapadyante Pritavatvaye Dehin: Sthastmanyenanusayati Yathakaram Yathashrutam" and from the "andeshu Peshish Tarushvnishneshtu Prano Jeevamupadhavati Tatra Tatra" from this verse and from the "indian" Both thinkers and Jain philosophers, vegetation etc
 real and earth Shri Adi has also believed in the existence of soul in movable roots
 at: unhen sarvatmavaadi vichaar kaa samarthak kaha ja saktaa he
 In fact, in trees, planets, subconscious, even unconscious things, people who believe in the power of soul or organism are still found in many countries, such as the cow of the world, which are often not only of spirits, especially of their dead ancestors, but of such souls
 They also worship people whom they do not understand as related to any particular body or object or to the deity of natural substances or arrogant deities

 is veikshipt vichaardhaara se bharat swatantraaa ke pashchaat bhi sankramit he iskaa pratyaksh pramaan to shriman frank annthoni kii nichi sonch thi jise unhone 4 sitambar san 1977 ko sansad ke saamne rakhaa
 This omnipotent text of Vedic Age is also known as 'vedatrayi'
 pehle yah veda granth ek hi tha jiskaa naam yajurveda tha- ekaivasid yajurveda chaturdhah vyabhajat punah vahi yajurveda punah rik-yajus-saamah ke rup me prasiddh hua jisase vah 'trayee' kahalaaya | baad main veda ko padhanaa bahut kathin prathit hone laga, isliye usee ek veda ke teen yaa chaar vibhaag kiye gaye
 Then he came to be known as Vedatrayi in the form of Rigyajusam or Chaturveda as Rigyjusamatharva after a long time
 mantron kaa prakaar or aashay yani arth ke aadhaar par vargeekaran kiya gaya
 Its basis is as follows - vaidic parampara do prakaar ke he - brahm parampara or aditya parampara
 The Vedatrayi tradition of both traditions was famous in ancient times
 vishwa main shabd-prayog kii teen sheliyaan hoti he: padya, gadhy or gaan
 There are three such divisions 'verse, prose and song' of Vedas mantras - padya main akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam kaa nishchit niyam hota he
 Therefore, the noun of fixed letter-number and Ved-mantras with foot and punctuation is 'rik'
 jin mantron main chand ke niyamanusaar akshar-sankhya tathaa paad evam viraam rishidrisht nahin he, ve gadyatmak mantra 'yajuh' kehalaate hai or jitne mantra ganaatmak hai, ve mantra ‘'sam'’ kehalaate hai
 On the basis of these three types of word-publishing-styles, the word 'trilogy' is also used for Veda in scripture and folk
 yajurveda gadhysangrah he, at: is yajurveda main jo rugveda ke chandobaddh mantra hai, unako bhi yajurveda padhane ke samay gadhy jaisaa hi padhaa jaataa he
 The said four divisions of the Vedas were not separate before the end of Dwaparyuga
 us samay to rik, yajuh or sam - in teen shabd-shaileonme sangrahatmak ek vishisht adhyayaneey shabd-raashi hi veda kehalaati thi
 Atharva also became attached to Veda's counterpart after that, then in place of 'trilogy' he started being called 'chaturveda'
 When the Guru was angry, Yajnavalkya, who received all the Vedas from Aditya, said in his memory after Vedatrayi and in front of Puranas, including Atharva, Veda s Tharvapuranani eti
 vartmaan kaal main veda chaar hai- lekin pehle ye ek hi the
 In the present tense, the Vedas are considered four
 parantu in chaaron ko milakar ek hi 'veda granth' samajha jaataa tha
 Significantly, despite the trilogy, the Veda was one, then it was divided into four parts
 sunne se failane or peedi-dar-peedi yaad rakhane ke kaaran vaa srishtikarta brahmaji bhi apaurushey vanike rupame praapt karne ke kaaran shruti, swatah pramaan ke kaaran amnaay, purush bhinn ishvarkrut hone se apaurushey ityadi naam vedon ke hai
 Hearing and remembering Gurmukh in the order of reading and reciting the Veda is of great importance in terms of the preservation and success of the Veda
 isi kaaran veda ko ‘'shruti'’ bhi kehete hai
 The Veda is conserved through diligent practice, hence the name "amnaya"
 vedon kii raksharth maharishiyon ne asht vikrutiyonki rachana kii he -jataa maala shikha rekha dhwajo dando ratho ghanah | ashtau vikrutyah prokto krampurva maharaayah || jiske falswarup pracheen kalke tarah aaj bhi hrasv, deergh,plutt or udaatt,anudaatt swarit adike anurup mantroccharan hota he
 Accordingly, the classification of the Vedic word-zodiac of each branch - each Veda mentioned above has four parts
 pehle bhaag mantrabhag ke alaava anya teen bhagako veda na maanane vaale bhi hai lekin aisa vichaar tarkpurna siddh hote nahin dekha gaya hai
 In the eternal Vedic tradition, mantra, Brahmin, Aranyaka and Upanishad are the four components of the same Veda
 kul milakar vedake bhaag ye hai :- Despite the above four sections being Vedas, some people consider only 'samhita' as Vedas
 dwaparayug kii samaapti ke samay shrikrishnadwaipayan vedavyas ji ne yagyanushthan ke upyog ko drushtigat rakhkar us ek veda ke chaar vibhaag kar diye or in chaaron vibhaagon kii shiksha chaar shishyon ko di
 These four divisions are famous as Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda
 pel, vaishampayan, jaimini or sumantu naamak -chaar shishyon ko kramshah rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda or atharvaveda kii shiksha di
 These four disciples taught Shakal etc
 to their different disciples
 in shishyon ke dwaara apane-apane adheen vedon ke prachaar va sangrakshan ke kaaran ve vaidic granth,charan ,shakha, pratishakha or anushaakha ke madhyam se bahut rupame vistaarit hogaye | unheen prachaarak rishiyon ke naam se prasiddh hai
 The aforementioned four disciples started as many disciples as they were called Charanasamuh
 Each stage has many branches in us
 or isi tarah pratishakha,anushaakha aadi ban gaye
 Several branches of the Vedas, that is, the method of lecture, have been described
 rishi patanjali ke mahabhashya ke anusaar rugveda kii 21, yajurveda kii 101, samaveda kii 1001, arthvveda kii 9 is prakaar 1131 shakhaaen hai parantu aaj 12 shakhaaen hi mul granthon main uplabdh hai
 The Vedic words of each branch of the Veda are available in four parts: 1
 Samhita 2
 Brahmin 3
 Aranyaka 4
 Upanishads
 kuch log inamen samhita ko hi veda maanate hai
 The remaining three parts are considered as the interpretation texts of the Vedas
 alag shakhaon main mul samhita to vahi rahati hai lekin aaranyak or brahman granthon main antar aa jaataa he
 Upanishad is also found in many mantras, as in the Shuklayujurveda mantrabhag, the Isavasopanishad
 In the old times, there were as many branches as there were mantras, Brahmins, Aranyakas and Upanishads
 Babajud of such branches is also found in texts of only 9 branches today
 anya shakhaonme kisiike mantra,kisiike brahman,kisiike aaranyak or kisiike upanishad hi paaya jaataa he
 Not only this, even more branches are found in Upanishads, only then more Upanishads are found
 vaidic rishiyu ne vedon ko janakalyanme pravrutt paaya
 Undoubtedly as it is: Yethām vāchān kalyānimavadāni janebhyā: the same as veda yagyānthāmbhāprivrāta kālānuपूर्वābhābhīश्चāश्चāश्च yajā तa: tasmādīn kalvidyānastra or astrology veda veda veda yajñām veda प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति प्रवृत्ति veda shabd vid dhaatu main ghan pratyay lagane se bana he
 In the Sanskrit texts, adjectives such as vidya gyan and vidya gaina, realize the meaning of knowledge and benefit from vid dhatu
 vedon ke vishay unki vyakhya par nirbhar karte hai - agni, yajna, surya, indra, som, brahm, man-aatma, jagat-utpatti, padaarthon ke gun, dharm, daampaty, dhyaan-yoga, praan jaise vishay isamen barambar aate hai
 In the Yajna, the deity, matter, purpose, and method are appointed
 granthon ke hisaab se inkaa vivaran is prakaar he - The Rigveda is considered the oldest of the four Vedas

 It has both prose and verse
 isamen yajna karm kii pradhanta he
 In ancient times it had 101 branches but at present it has only five branches - Kathak, Kapisthal, Maitrayani, Taittiriya, Vajasaneyi
 is veda ke do bhed hai - krishna yajurveda or shukla yajurveda
 Maharishi Veda Vyasa has compiled Krishna Yajurveda
 iskaa doosraa naam taittiriya samhita bhi he
 Mantra and Brahmin parts are mixed in it
 shukla yajurveda - ise surya ne yajyavlky ko upadesh ke rup main diya tha

 The last forty-fourth chapter is Ishavasopanishad
 yah gey granth he
 It has a repository of singing, it is the origin of Indian music
 richaon ke gayan ko hi sam kehete hai
 It had 1001 branches
 parantu aajkal teen hi prachlit hai - kothumiya, jaimineey or ranyneey
 It is divided into anterior and posterior
 purvarchik main chaar kand hai - aagney kand, endra kand, pavamaan kand or aarany kand
 There are a total of 640 mantras in all the four scandals
 phir mahanamnyarchik ke 10 mantra hai
 Thus there are a total of 650 spells in the Purvartik
 chah prapathak hai
 Uttarachik is divided into 21 chapters

 kuch log isamen mantra-tantra bhi khojate hai
 While this Veda preaches Brahm Gyan, it also explains the way of salvation
 ise brahm veda bhi kehete hai
 It is also called Atharva Angiras mainly due to the mantras of Rishis and Atharvan
 yah 20 kandon main vibhakt he
 There are many sutras in each kand and there are mantras in sutras
 is veda main kul 5977 mantra hai
 Its two branches Shaunik and Piplad are available today
 atharvaveda kaa vidvan chaaron vedon kaa gyaata hota he
 In the Yajna, the Rigveda calls for the Gods, the Samaveda is the oblation, the Yajurveda's Adhvaryu Dev: finishes the coterm and the Atharvaveda's Brahma controls the entire Yagya Karma
 ayurveda, dhanurveda, gandharvaveda tathaa sthapatyaved- ye kramshah chaaron vedon ke upved katyayan ne batalaaye hai
 For all round practice of Vedas, there are texts of education, kalpa, grammar, nirukta, chhanda and astrology which are called 6 parts
 pratipadsutra, anupad, chandobhasha, dharamshastra, nyaay tathaa vaisheshik- ye 6 darshana upang granth bhi uplabdh he
 The topics of appendages are as follows - veda kii samhitaon main mantraksharon main khadi tathaa aadi rekhaayen lagaakar unke ucch, madhyam, yaa mand sangitamay swar uccharan karne ke sanket kiye gayi hai
 They are named as the sublime, Anudatta and Swarit
 ye swar bahut pracheen samay se prachlit hai or mahamuni patanjali ne apane mahabhashya main inke mukhya mukhya niyamon kaa samavesh kiya he
 Vowels are spoken more or less as they also have two distinctions
 jaise udaatt-udaattatar, anudaatt-anudaattatar, swarit-swaritodatt
 Apart from these, there is considered to be another vowel - Shruti - the three vowels merge in it
 is prakaar kul swaron kii sankhya 7 ho jaati he
 Even in these seven vowels, there is a distinction between the vowels for which there is some change in the vowels
 yadhyapi in swaron ke ankan or tankan main kai vidhiyaan prayog kii jaati hai or prakaashak-bhashyakaron main koi ek vidha saamaanya nahin he, adhikansh sthanon par anudaatt ke liye akshar ke neeche ek aadi lakeer tathaa swarit ke liye akshar ke upar ek khadi rekha banane kaa niyam he
 Sublime has no sign of its own
 isse ankan main samasya aane se kai lekhak-prakaashak swar chihnon kaa prayog hi nahin karte
 There are many types of verses used in Vedic mantras, the main ones are- iske anusaar vedokt yagyon kaa anushthan hi veda ke shabdon kaa mukhya upyog mana gaya he
 From the beginning of the creation, there has generally been a diversity in the style, chanting and rituals of chanting
 is vividhta ke kaaran hi vedon kii shakhaon kaa vistaar hua he
 There are 21 branches of Rigveda, 101 branches of Yajurveda, 1000 branches of Samaveda and 9 branches of Atharva Veda - thus there are a total of 1,131 branches
 is sankhya kaa ullekh maharishi patanjali ne apane mahabhashya main bhi kiya he
 Out of the above 1,131 branches, currently only 12 branches are available in the original texts: - uparyukt 12 shakhaon main se keval 6 shakhaon kii adhyayan-style praapt he-shakal, taittareey, madhyandini, kaanv, kauthum tathaa shaunak shakha
 It would also not be inappropriate to say that some other texts of other branches are available, but they cannot get full introduction of the branch and the names of many branches are also not available
 jaisaa ki upar likhaa he, vedon ke kai shabdon kaa samajhnaa utana saral nahin rahaa he
 In order to understand the real meaning of Vedanka, Vedangauka was invented from within
 Because of this, the meanings described in them cannot be known
 Most of the controversies have been about the nature of God, that is, the one or the like of many gods
 vedonke vaastavik arth vahi kar saktaa he jovedang- shiksha,kalp, vyakaran, nirukt,chand or jyotishka gyaata he
 The interpretation of Sanskrit scholars of Europe has also been inspired by the theory of indo-aryan caste
 pracheen kaal main hi inaki satta ko chunauti dekar kai aise mat prakat hue jo aaj bhi dharmik mat kehalaate hai lekin kai roopon main bhinn hai
 Their main differences are explained below
 uname se jiskaa apana avichhinn paramparase veda,shakha,or kalpasutron se nirdeshit hokar ek adwitiya brahmatatvako iswar maanakar kisi ek devvadame na ulajhakar vedavadame raman karte hai ve vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm mananevaale he ve hi vedonko sarvopari maanate he
 Apart from this, there are some sects who hold different views and consider them as separate gods
 jin vishyon par vivaad rahaa he unka varnan neeche diya he
 Yajna: There is a contradiction in many scholars, opinions and commentators regarding the importance of the present form of Yajna
 yajna main aag ke prayog ko pracheen parsi pujan vidhi ke itnaa samaan hona or havan kii atyadhik mahatta ke prati vidwaanon main ruchi rahi he
 Deity: There has been disagreement among many scholars about the word Dev
 vedokt nirgun- niraakaar or sagun- saakaar me se antim pakshako maanane vaale kai maton main ise mahamanushya ke rup main vishisht shakti praapt saakaar charitra masajhate hai or unka murti rup main pujan karte hai to anya kai inhen ishwar ke hi naam bataate hai
 Philanthropic things, learned people and guiding mantras have been called devas
 udaahranarth agni shabd kaa arth aag na samajhakar sabase aage yani pratham yani parameshwar samajhate hai
 The meaning of the deity Shavad is considered divine, that is, full of the power of God - like earth etc
 isi mat main mahadev, devon ke adhipati hone ke kaaran ishwar ko kehete hai
 Similarly, due to the universal God Vishnu and truth everywhere, it is called Brahma
 is prakaar brahma, vishnu or mahadev kisi charitra ke naam nahin balki ishwar ke hi naam he
 Vedic and temporal words are used to determine the meaning of grammar and nirukta
 iske abhavame arthke anarth kar baithte he
 Similarly, Ganesh, Prajapati, Devi, Buddha, Lakshmi etc
 are the names of God
 vedadi shastronme aae vibhann ek hi parameshwarake he
 As has been said in the Upanishads - Eko Dev Sarvabhuteshu Gudha: Omnipresent Sarvabandhatra Some people quarrel in the nature of God
 inmese koi murtipuja karte he or koi aise log he jo murtipuja ke viruddh hai or ishwar ko ekmaatr satya, sarvopari samajhate hai
 Ashwamedha: From Ashwamedha comes the idea of violence and sacrifice
 yah kai hinduon ko bhi ascharyajanak lagata he kyonki kai sthanon par shuddhtavaadi hinsa se parhez karte rahe hai
 Many believe that Advaram is also used in the word Medha, which means non-violence
 atah medh kaa bhi arth kuch or rahaa hoga
 Similarly, the meaning of the word Ashwa must have been power rather than horse
 shriram sharma acharya krit bhaashayon ke anusaar ashv shabd kaa arth shakti, gau shabd kaa arth poshan he
 With this, the meaning of Ashwamedha seems to be different from horse sacrifice
 som:kuch log ise sharaab maanate hai lekin kai anuwaadon ke anusaar ise kuta-piskar banaaya jaataa tha
 Therefore, it does not look like a drink
 par iske asli rup kaa nirdhaaran nahin ho paaya he
 206 BC refers to the years before the birth of Christ
 isa ke janm ko adhaar maanakar uske janm se 206 isa purv yaa varsh purv ke varsh ko is prakaar pradarshit kiya jaataa he
 It is considered a collective year based on the Julian calendar

 In India, there are many famous Panchagas like Vikram Samvat which begins 57 or 58 years before the birth of Jesus
 iske alaava shaq samvath bhi prasiddh he
 Shaka Samvat is the ancient era of India which begins 78 years after the birth of Jesus
 shaq samvath bharat kaa rashtriya panchag he
 Some other ancient era prevalent in India are as follows: - uparokt antar ke aadhaar par 206 isa purv ke anusaar vikrami samvath, saptarshi samvath, kaliyug samvath or pracheen saptarshi aadi main varsh aadi nikaale ja sakate hai

 In astronomy, the Seyfert Galaxy is one of the two major types of active galaxies
 quesar doosraa pramukh prakaar hota he
 In both, the active galactic nucleus shines very brightly, but where the other part of the galaxy in Quasar is not visible to this central sharpness, the other part of the galaxy can be clearly seen in the Seyfert galaxies
 puure brahmand main dekhi gai gallexiyon main se lagbhag 10% seyafort gallexiyaan hai
