 hastrekha shaastra yaa kirmancy "haath" or mantia se bana he) hatheli ko padhakar lakshan kaa varnan or bhavishya bataane kii kala he jise hastrekha adhyayan yaa hastrekha shaastra bhi kaha jaataa he
 The use of this art is seen worldwide with many cultural variations
 jo hastrekha padhate hai, unhen aam taur par hastrekhavid, hatheli padhane vaala, haath padhane vaala, hastrekha vishleshak yaa hastrekha shastri bhi kaha jaataa he
 Palmistry is generally considered pseudoscience
 neeche ullikhit jaankaree sankshep main aadhunik hastrekha shaastra ke mukhya tatv he, jinamein se kai vibhinn rekhaon kii vyakhya aksar virodhabhasi hoti hai or hastrekhavid vibhinn "skulon" main bante hote hai
 Palmistry has its roots in Chinese wising, astrology in India and Roma prophets
 mana jaataa he ki hindu rishi valmiki ne ek pustak likhi, jiske sheershak kaa angreji anuwaad "da teachings of valmiki maharishi on mail pamistry" hoga or jisamen 567 shloke hai
 From India, palmistry spread to China, Tibet, Egypt, Persia and other countries of Europe
 china se, hastrekha shaastra kaa yunaan main prasar hua, jahaan anexagores ne iskaa prayog kiya
 However, modern palmists have often associated traditional futuristic techniques with psychology, holistic diagnosis, alternative methods of estimation as well
 hastrekha shaastra main haath vyakti kii hatheli ko "padhakar" uske charitra yaa bhavishya ke jivan kaa moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 Various "lines" and "peaks" or, are suggested by reading, presumably in relation to their associated sizes, properties and intersections
 kuch rivaajon main hastrekha padhane vaale ungaliyon, nakhunon, ungaliyon ke nishaan or vyakti kii twachaa kii rekhaon, twachaa kii bunaavat va rang, aakaar, hatheli ke aakaar or haath kaa lacheelaapan bhi dekhte hai
 a palmist is usually the 'dominant hand' of the person
 In some traditions of palmistry, the other hand is assumed to hold hereditary or family traits or is based on the palmist's cosmological beliefs, giving information about past life or pre-birth conditions
 "shastreey" hastrekha shaastra ke liye buniyadi dhaanche kii jad unani puranic kathaon main nihit hai
 Each area of the palm and fingers belongs to a goddess or deity and the features of that area are indicative of the nature of the corresponding aspect of the subject
 udhaaharan ke liye, anamika apollo unani devtaa ke saath judi he; anguthi vaali is ungali kii visheshtaayen kala, sangeet, saundaryashastra, shoharat, dhan or sadbhaav san sambhddha vishyon kii vivechna ke dauraan dekhin jaati hai
 Although there has been debate about which hand is better to read, both have their own importance
 yah maanane kaa rivaaj he ki baanyaa haath vyakti kii sambhaavnaaon ko pradarshit karata he or dahinaa sahi vyaktitv kaa pradarshak hota he
 Some say the importance is about which hand is seen
 "daahine haath se bhavishya or baayen se ateet dekha jaataa he
 "" The left hand tells what we are born with and the right shows what we have made of it
 " "dahinaa haath purushon kaa padhaa jaataa he, jabaki mahilaon kaa baayan haath padhaa jaataa he
 "" The left hand tells what God has given you and the right tells you what to do in this regard
 " But these are all things to say, only instinct and experience will tell you better which hand will be better to read in the end
 hastrekha shaastra or unhen padhane ke prakaar ke aadhaar par hastrekhavid hatheli kii akruti or ungaliyon kii linon, twachaa ke rang or bunaavat, nakhunon kii banaavat, hatheli or ungaliyon kii anupaatik aakaar, poron kii pramukhataa or haath kii kai anya khaasiyaton ko dekh sakate hai
 In most streams of palmistry, hand figures are divided into 4 or 10 major classical types and sometimes resort to classical elements or features
 haath kaa aakaar sanketit prakaar ke charitra ke lakshanon However, despite the different forms, the most common classifications are used by modern palmists
 swayan apni hatheli main prabhutv vaale tatv tathaa prakruti nirdhaarit karnaa sahaj he haath ke aakaar ke vishleshan main rekhaon kii sankhya or panktiyon kii gunvattta bhi shaamil kii ja sakati he
 In some traditions of palmistry, earth and water hands have fewer and deeper lines, while air and fire hands may show more lines that have less clear definition
 lagbhag sabhi haathon main teen rekhaaen pai jaati hai or aam taur par hastrekhavid in par sabase zyada jor dete hai
 This line originates from the edge of the palm above the thumb and rises in the shape of the arch in the direction of the wrist
 mana jaataa he ki yah rekha vyakti kii urja or shakti, shaareerik swasthya or aam khushhaali kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 It is also believed that lifelines reflect changes in life including accidents, bodily injuries, restorations
 aam dharna ke vipareet, aadhunik hastrekhavid aam taur par yah vishwaas nahin karte ki ek vyakti kii jivan rekha kii lambaai ke vyakti kii umr se judi hui he
 Additional main lines or forms include: hastrekhashastra ke anusaar, yah rekha ek vyakti ko uddeshy kii tivrata yaa kisi uddeshy ke prati ekaagratha pradaan karti he, jiskaa swabhaav haath par is rekha kii sahi sthiti or isse nikalanevaali kinhin shakhaon se nirdhaarit hoti he, jo ek saamaanya maamla hota he
 In those hands, in which such line is present as a single sign with no branch, it indicates a very deep nature and needs special care of individuals
 is rekha kii saamaanya sthiti sabase badi ungali ke neeche shuru hoti he or saamaanya rup se vahaan samaapt hoti he, jahaan dil kii rekha choti ungali ke neeche haath ke kinare khatm hoti he, isse vyakti ke ausat hiton kaa sanket miltaa he or swabhaav kii gahanta vishuddh rup se yahaan se nikalanevaali kinhin shakhaon kii disha se nirdhaarit hoti he
 The upper half of the palm, which is immediately below the fingers, represents the person's higher or intellectual nature and the lower half of the palm represents the materialistic side of the person's temperament
 agar in aadhe-aadhe hisson main se ek bada hota he, jo mukhya rekha kii kendriya sthiti yaa is maamle main ekal anuprastha hatheli rekha se nirdhaarit hota he, vyakti ke swabhaav ke vyapak vikaas ke pahalu ko pradarshit karata he
 While it is a general theory that if this line falls below its normal position it indicates a deeper intellectual temperament, but if it is above its normal position, it reflects a more materialistic nature and interests
 is rekha se nikali kinhin shakhaon kii disha kaa is rekha par mahatvapurn prabhaav padataa he, jisase upar paribhaashit parinaamon se upyukt sanshodhan hote hai or yah haath ke ubhaar kii prakruti par aadhaarit hota he
 For example, if a branch from this line moves towards the lower edge of the hand at the Moon's protrusion opposite the thumb, it indicates that the person is emotional and quite hesitant
 anya choti rekhaaen: Those who hold such truths to the test of logic often classify palmists as alleged psychologists, using a technique called "cold reading"
 cold reeding ko ek aisa abhyaas mana jaataa he jisamen hastrekhavidon sahit sabhi prakaar ke rekha adhyayankartaaon ko maansashasthri ke samaksh pesh hona padataa he
 According to a slightly more widely accepted finding, the accuracy of palmistry has been accepted as a system of character analysis, and no conclusive evidence has yet been found that there is a connection between palm lines and the person's character
 isse pare ki vishleshan se taarkik aadhaar par tay kiya jaye ki vyakti kaa ek gunasutra vikaar se peedit hona yaa ek nishchit anupaat main sankhyikeey samooh unke ankon ke aadhaar se sambhddha hote hai
 No conclusive data or facts have yet been found to support the claims made by the palmist in relation to life span or personality type

 Einstein's intellectual achievements and singularities have made the term "einstein" synonymous with "intelligent"
 albert oinstin kaa janm germany main wootemberg ke ek yahudee parivaar main hua
 His father was an engineer and salesman
 unki maan paulin oinstin thi
 Although Einstein had difficulty speaking initially, he topped the studies
 unki maatrubhaasha german thi or baad main unhone italvi or angreji bhi sikhi
 In 1880 his family moved to the city of Munich, where his father and uncle jointly opened a company called "electrotechnic Frébich J
 Einstein & See", which manufactured electrical appliances
 or isane munich ke Oktoberfest meley main pehali baar roshni kaa prabandh bhi kiya tha
 His family did not believe in Jewish religious traditions, and for this reason Einstein could go to Catholic school
 apni maan ke kehane par unhone sarangi bajaanaa siikhaa
 He did not like this and later abandoned it, but later he enjoyed Mozart's Sarangi music
 1894 main, unke pita kii company ko munich shahar main vidyut prakaash vyavastha ke liye aapurti karne kaa anubandh nahin mil sakaa
 Due to the loss, he had to sell his company
 vyapaar kii talash main, oinstin parivaar italy chale gaye, jahaan ve sabase pehle milan or phir kuch maheene baad pavia shahar main bas gayi
 Even after the family left for Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to complete his studies
 disambar 1894 ke ant main, unhone pavia main apane parivaar se milane italy kii yatra kii
 During his time in Italy, he wrote a short essay titled "examining the state of the ether in a magnetic field"
 apane puure jeevankaal main, oinstin ne saikadon kitaaben or lekh prakashit kiye
 He published more than 300 scientific and 150 non-scientific research papers
 1965 ke apane vyaakhyaan main, oppenheimar ne ullekh kiya ki oinstin ke praarambhik lekhan main kai trutiyon hoti thi jiske kaaran unke prakaashan main lagbhag das varshon kii deree ho chuki thi: " ek aadmi jiskaa trutiyon ko hi sahi karne main ek lanbaa samay lage, kitna mahaan hoga"
 Apart from his own work, he also collaborated with other scientists, including Bose Einstein statistics, Einstein refrigerator and many more
 
 Anus Mirabilis Papers is related to four articles that Einstein published in 1905 in a scientific journal called Onlen der Physik, which included photoelectric effects, Brownian motion, special relativism, and e = mc2
 in chaar lekhon ne aadhunik bhautikee kii neenv ke liye kaaphi yogadan diya he or antariksh, samay tathaa dravya par logo kii soch ko badla he
 These four papers are: san 1900 main onalen der physic ko prastut, oinstin ke pehla shodh-patr "keshika aakarshan" par tha
 It was published in 1901 with the title "extracts from capillary phenomena"
 1902-1903 main prakashit do patron main parmanuviya ghatana kii vyakhya, sankhyikeey ke madhyam se karne kaa prayaas kiya
 This paper formed the foundation for a 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian motion can be used as concrete evidence for the presence of molecules
 1903 or 1904 main unka shodh mukhya rup se, prasar ghatana par parimit parmaanu aakaar kaa asar par sambandhit rahe
 He expressed the principle of relativity
 jo ki harman minkovski ke anusaar antariksh se antariksh-samay ke bich baari-baari se parivartanheenata ke samanyikaran ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Other theories that Einstein coined and later proved to be correct included the principle of equality and the theory of temperate normalization of quantum numbers
 oinstin ke "chalit nikaayon ke bijli kaa gativigyaan par" shodh-patr 30 june 1905 ko purna hua or usee varsh kii 26 sitambar ko prakashit hua
 This establishes harmony between Maxwell's equation of electricity and magnetism and the theory of mechanics, after major changes in mechanics close to the speed of light
 yahi baad main oinstin ke saapekshata ke vishesh siddhant ke rup main janaa gaya
 The conclusion was that, in the time-space structure, the moving matter is seen as slow and narrow, when it is measured in the observer's frame
 is shodh-patr main yah bhi tark diya ki luminipheras ether kaa vichaar zarurat se zyaada tha
 In his paper on mass-energy equivalence, Einstein constructed e = mc2 from special relativity equations
 1905 se oinstin kaa saapekshata main shodh kai varshon tak vivaadaaspad bana rahaa, halaaki ise kai agrani bhautikavidon jaise kii maiks plank dwaara sweekaara bhi gaya
 In a 1905 paper, Einstein explained that light itself is made up of local particles
 oinstin ke prakaash quanta pariklpana ko maiks plank or niles bor sahit lagbhag sabhi bhautikavidon, ne asweekaar kar diya
 This hypothesis was universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Mulliken's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and the Compton scattering measurements
 oinstin ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki aavriti kii prayek lahar, urja ke prayek photonon ke sangrah ke saath judaa hota he 
 He did not say more about this, because he was not sure how particles are related to waves
 lekin unhone suzav diya kii he,ki is pariklpana ko kuch prayogtmak parinaamon dwaara samajhaayaa ja saktaa hai jise hi baad main vishesh rup se prakashavidyut prabhaav kaha gaya
 In 1907, Einstein proposed a model that each atom oscillates independently in a lattice structure
 oinstin model main, prayek parmaanu swatantra rup se dolan karata he oinstin ko pataa tha ki vaastavik dolanon kii aavriti alag hoti hai lekin phir bhi is siddhant kaa prastaavit kiya, kyonki yah ek spasht pradarshan tha ki kaise kwantum yantriki, parmparik yantriki main vishisht garmi kii samasya ko hal kar saktaa hai
 Peter debai refined this model
 1910 ke dashak ke dauraan, alag-alag pranaaliyon ko kwantum yantriki ke daayre main laane ke liye iskaa vistaar hua
 Following the discovery of Ernest Rutherford's nucleus, and the proposition that electrons revolve around planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the discrete motion of electrons in atoms of elements by quantum mechanical, initiated by Planck and developed by Einstein And the periodic table of the elements can be explained
 1898 ke wilhem viena ke tark ko iske saath jod kar oinstin ne iske vikaas main yogadan diya
 Vienna showed that, by the hypothesis of a thermodynamic variability of a thermal equilibrium state, all black rotations at different temperatures can be derived from each other by a simple transfer process
 1911 main oinstin ne yah paaya kii vahi samoshna siddhant yah dikhaata hai kii maatra jo kisi bhi yantric gati main pramaathran he ko ek sthiroshm aparivartaneey hona chahie
 Arnold Summerfield identified temperate invertebrates as dynamic variables in traditional mechanics
 is siddhant ke anusaar- Albert Einstein has made a huge contribution in this subject
 yatra karte samay, oinstin ne apni patni elsa tathaa dattak putree kadamuni margot or ilse ke liye patr likhaa karte the
 These letters can be found at The Hebrew University
 margot oinstin ne in nijee patron ko janata ke liye uplabdh karaane kii anumati de di thi, lekin saath hi yah anurodh kiya ki uski mrityu ke bees saal baad tak aisa nahin kiya jaye 
 ) Einstein had expressed his interest in the profession of Thathera and was made an honorary member of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union
 hebrew uniwarsity ke albert oinstin abhilekhaagaar kii barbara volf ne bibisi ko bataaya ki 1912 or 1955 ke bich likhe nijee patrachaar ke lagbhag 3500 patr hai
 On July 14, 1930, Einstein met the great litterateur of India, the mystic and Nobel laureate Gurudev Rabindranath Thakur, in Berlin
 pashchim kii taarkik vichaardhaara kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale ek apane samay ke mahaan vaigyanik or purv kii dharmik vichaardhaara kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale ek mahaan vichaarak evam bhakt kavi kii is mulaakaat or unke bich hue samvaad ko itihaas kii ek anuthi viraasat mana jaataa he

 Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, stating, "I have no intention of keeping quiet about it
 " princeton ke ek nivasee yaad karte hai ki oinstin ne kabhi kaale chaatro ke liye college kii shiksha shulk kaa bhugtan bhi kiya tha
 Before World War II, a newspaper published a brief statement in one of its columns that Einstein was so well known in America that people stopped him on the street and asked him to explain his theory
 aakhirkaar unhone is nirantar poochtacha se bachane kaa ek tarika nikaala
 He used to say to them "sorry! i often consider Professor Einstein to be me but he is not me
" " oinstin kai upanyaas, filmon, naatakon or sangeet kaa vishay yaa prerana rahe hai
 He was a favorite character for his portrayal of "mad" scientists "or other professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied
 time magazine ke fredrick golden ne ek baar likhaa tha ki oinstin "ek cartoonist kaa sapana sach hone" jaise the
 Einstein received many awards and honors, and in 1922 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for the discovery of the electromagnetic effect"
 1921 main koi bhi namakan alfred nobel dwaara nirdhaarit maapdando main khara nahin utar, to 1921 kaa puraskaar aage badha 1922 main oinstin ko isse sammanit kiya gaya
