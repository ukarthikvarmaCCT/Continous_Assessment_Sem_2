 On his return to Nagpur in 1915, he became active in the Congress and later became the secretary of the Vidarbha Provincial Congress
 When the country level session of the Congress was held in Nagpur in 1920, Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar presented the first proposal in the Congress about the goal of complete independence, then it was not passed
 In 1921, Satyagraha was arrested in the non-cooperation movement of the Congress and he was imprisoned for one year
 By then he had become so popular that veterans like Pandit Motilal Nehru and Hakim Ajmal Kha addressed the gathering organized to welcome him upon his release

 This was the reason that when the anti-salt law movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi in December 1930, he personally handed over the responsibility of the Sangh chief to Dr
 Parapanje along with a dozen of his colleagues, in which he was imprisoned for 9 months
 Similarly, in 1929 when the resolution of the former Swaraj was passed in the Congress session held in Lahore and on 26 January 1930, a call was made to hoist the tricolor across the country, on the instructions of Dr
 Hedgewar Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar in all the Sangh branches on January 30
 It was resolved to attain full swaraj by hoisting the tricolor

 Mahadev followed Indian culture and ideas very strictly
 keshav ke maanas-patal par bade bhai mahadev ke vichaaron kaa gaharaa prabhaav tha
 But he had revolutionary ideas from childhood itself, rather than older brother

 As soon as he did his medical career, he realized his sharp leadership talent and was nominated as Vice President of the Hindu Mahasabha Bengal region
 kalkatte main padhai karte hue unka mail-milaap bengal ke krantikariyon se hua
 Since Keshav lived in Calcutta at the home of his elder brother Mahadev's friend Shyam Sundar Chakraborty, the local people used to know and address him by the name of Keshav Chakraborty
 unki asaadhaaran yogyata ko maddenjar rakhte hue unhen pehle anushilan samiti kaa saadhaaran sadsy banaaya gaya
 After that, when he stood the test of efficiency, he was also made an internal member of the committee

 Participated in Gandhi's non-violent non-cooperation movement and civil disobedience movement, but fiercely criticized the Khilafat movement

 He actively collaborated with Dr
 Munje during the 1923 riots in Nagpur
 agle saal saavarkar ke patr hindutv kaa sanskaran niklaa jisamen inkaa yogadan bhi tha
 It was with his original manuscript
 1921 i
 main angrejo ne turki ko parrast kar, vahaan ke sultan ko gaddi se utaar diya tha, vahi sultan musalamaanon ke khalipha / mukhiya bhi kehalaate the, ye baat bharat va anya muslim deshon ke musalamaanon ko nagavar gujri jisase jagah-jagah aandolan hue l hindusthan main khaskar kerala ke malabar jile main aandolan ne ugr rup le liya l Muslim communalism started raising its head only after Gandhi's arrival on India's political scene in 1922 AD

 In such a situation, many Hindu leaders went to malabar-kerala to know the state of Kerala and to help the looted Hindus there, among them prominent Hindu Mahasabhai leader of Nagpur, Dr
 Balakrishna Shivram Munje, Dr
 Hedgewar, Arya Samaj leader Swami Shraddhanand ji etc
 After a while there were hindu-muslim riots in Nagpur and many other cities too
 Distracted by such incidents, Dr
 Munje in Nagpur has made some famous Called a meeting of Hindu leaders, including Dr
 Hedgewar and Dr
 Paranjpe, in this meeting they decided to make a hindu-militia, the aim was to "protect Hindus and make Hindustan a strong Hindu nation"
 Dharamvir Dr
 Munje gave the responsibility of standing to Dr
 Keshav Baliram Hedgewar
 dosahab aise vyakti the, jinhone vyakti kii kshamtaaon ko ubhaarne ke liye naye-naye taur-tareeke viksit kiye
 However, keeping in mind the unsuccessful revolution and erstwhile circumstances of the first Indian independence struggle, he laid the foundation of a paramilitary organization
 is prakaar 28 / 9 / 1925 ko apane pita-tulya guru dow baalkrishna shivaram munje, unke shishy dow headgavar, shri paranjape or baapu sahib soni ne ek hindu yuvak club kii neenv daali, jiskaa naam kalantar main rashtriya swanyasevak sangh diya gaya l It is worth mentioning here that the basis of this militia was formed - Veer Savarkar's Rashtriya Philosophy book in which it was defined as Hindu - a indus-indus era, Yes India role
 pitrubhu-punyabhu Bhushchev sa Hindu Hindu tradition is shloke ke anusaar “bharat ke vah sabhi log hindu hai jo is desh ko pithrubhumi-punyabhumi maanate hai”l iname sanatani, aryasamaji, jain, buddha, sikh aadi panthon evam dharm vichaar ko maanane vaale va unka aacharan karne vaale samast jan ko hindu ke vyapak daayre main rakhaa gaya tha l musalmaan va isai is paribhaasha main nahin aate the atah unako is milicia main naa lene kaa nirnay liya gaya or keval hinduon ko hi liya janaa tay hua, mukhya mantra tha “aspashtataa nivaaran evam hinduon kaa sainiki kaaran”l To create such a militia, volunteers were recruited, branches were started for one hour each morning and evening
 To make it run smoothly, posts of teacher, head teacher, event etc
 were created
 In these branches it was decided to provide military education to senior volunteers along with exercise, manual labor, education of Hindu nationalism
 Sometimes during the night there were seminars of volunteers, including Maharana Pratap, Veer Shivaji, Guru Govind Singh, Banda Bairagi, Veer Savarkar, Mangal Pandey, Tantya Tope etc
 Biographies were read l used to tell me to read portions of the book written by Savarkar l thode samay baad is milicia ko naam diya gaya rashtriya swanyasevak sangh- jo aar

 dow headgavar ne jis dukhad sthiti ko vyakt kiya, usamen navsarjeet rashtriya swanyasevak sangh or hindu mahasabha ke netritv ke prayaas se- hindu yuvaaon main saahas ke saath yah naaraa gunjane laga “hindusthan hinduon kaa- nahin kisi ke baap kaa” is kathan kii vivechna dow headgavar ne in shabdon main kii:- “many gentlemen do not hesitate to say how Hindusthan is only for Hindus? This is the case of all those who live here
 Sorry that such statement / gentlemen do not know the meaning of the word nation
 Only a piece of land is not called a nation
 The people who have lived in the civilization and tradition since ancient times, a nation is formed by the culture of the same people
 This country has been named Hindusthan because of us
 If other people give it through communication If you want to settle in, then you can definitely settle
 We have never denied them, but we will not get even a single place here for those who come to our house as guests and take a knife on our neck
 l First get this ideology of Sangh right
 ek anya avasar par dow headgavar ne kaha tha “sangh to keval, hindusthan hinduon kaa- is dhyey vaakya ko sachcha kar dikhaanaa chahta he l” duusare deshon ke saamaan, “yah hinduon kaa hone ke kaaran”- is desh main hindu jo kahenge vahi purv disha hogi l yahi ek baat he jo sangh jaanata he, rashtriya swanyasevak sangh ke kaaryakartaaon ke liye kisi bhi anya pachade main padane kii aavashkata nahin he l” When Veer Savarkar was off sight in Ratnagiri, Dr
 Hedgewar went to meet him there
 tab tak vah vir saavarkar rachit pustak hindutv bhi pard chuke the
 Dr
 Hedgewar was very impressed with the ideas of that book and praised it saying that "veer Savarkar is an ideal person"
 donon kaa vishwaas tha ki jab tak hindu andh vishwaas, puraani roodhiwaadee soch, dharmik aadambaron ko nahin chhodenge tab tak hindu-jateevaad, chhot-achhut, shahari-banavaasi or chhetravaad ityadi main banta rahegaa or jab tak vah sangathit evam ek jute nahin hoga, tab tak vah sansar main apana uchit sthaan nahin le sakegaa
 In 1937, Veer Savarkar's termination ended and after that he could participate in politics

 In 1937, the Hindu Mahasabha was held in Karnavati
 is adhiveshan main vir saavarkar ke adhyakshiya bhaashan ko “hindu raashtra darshan” ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Among the founders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the two main men were Dr
 Munje and Dr
 Hedgewar Hindu Mahasabhai and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh formed the basis of the interpretation of Hindu and Hindu nationalism propounded by Veer Savarkar, as well as the original mantra of Veer Savarkar- Untouchability
 The principle of prevention and militarization of Hindus was accepted

 In 1938, the Arya Samaj decided to launch a movement against the jihadist orders of Nizam Hyderabad

 Veer Savarkar said that if Arya Samaj agrees with the movement, then the Hindu Mahasabha will give it full support

 In connection with Dharmaveer Dr
 Munje and Veer Savarkar, Dr
 Hedgewar identified the causes of India's slavery very closely and started the Sangh work for its permanent solution

 In the words of well-known language scientist Dr
 Hardev Outer, the history of Hindi literature actually begins from the Vedic period
 yah kahana hi thik hoga ki vaidic bhashaa hi hindi he
 It has been a misfortune of this language that its name has been changing in every era
 kabhi 'vaidic', kabhi 'sanskrit', kabhi 'praakrit', kabhi 'apbhransh' or ab - hindi
 Critics may say that there is a difference of land and sky between 'vedic Sanskrit' and 'hindi'
 par dhyaan dene yogya he ki hebrew, roosi, chini, german or tamil aadi jin bhashaaon ko 'bahut puraani' bataaya jaataa he, unke bhi pracheen or vartmaan roopon main jameen-aasmaan kaa antar he; par logon ne un bhashaaon ke naam nahin badale or unke parivartit swaroopon ko 'pracheen', 'madhyakaalin', 'aadhunik' aadi kaha gaya, jabaki 'hindi' ke sandarbh main prayek yug kii bhashaa kaa nayaa naam rakhaa jaataa rahaa
 While considering the prevailing assumptions regarding the origin and development of Hindi language, we have a question of the origin of the Hindi language towards the natural language and Aphrones languages around the tenth century
 apbhransh shabd kii vyutpatti or jain rachanakaaron kii apbhransh kritiyon kaa hindi se sambandh sthapit karne ke liye jo tark or pramaan hindi sahitya ke itihaas granthon main prastut kiye gayi hai un par vichaar karnaa bhi aavashyak he
 Generally, the emergence of Hindi literature is accepted from Prakrit's last apabhramsha-stage
 us samay apbhransh ke kai rup the or unamem saatvin-aathvin shatabdi se hi padya-rachana prarambh ho gayi thi
 The compositions which are found in terms of literature are in the form of Doha and their subjects, religion, policy, preaching etc
 are prominent

 This is the time when after the death of Emperor Harsha, many small petty centers were established in the country which used to struggle
 videshi musalamaanon se bhi inaki takkar hoti rahati thi
 Religious areas were disturbed
 in dinon uttar bharat ke anek bhaagon main buddha dharm kaa prachaar tha
 Buddhism developed in many forms, one of which was called Vajrayana
 vajrayani tantric the or siddh kehalaate the
 He propagated his opinion among the public in the lingua franca of that time
 hindi kaa pracheenatam sahitya inhen vajrayani sidhon dwaara tatkaleen lokbhasha puraani hindi main likhaa gaya
 After this comes the time of Nathpanthi Sadhus
 inhone buddha, shankar, tantra, yoga or shaiva maton ke mishran se apana nayaa panth chalaaya jisamen sabhi virgon or varnon ke liye dharm kaa ek saamaanya mat pratipaadit kiya gaya tha
 His many religious works written in popular old Hindi are available
 iske baad jainiyon kii rachanaayen milti hai
 Swayambhu's "pumachariu" or Ramayana is an eighth century work
 baudhon or nathpanthiyon kii rachanaayen muktak or keval dharmik hai par jainiyon kii anek rachanaayen jivan kii saamaanya anubhutiyon se bhi sambhddha hai
 Many of these are anthologies
 isi kaal main abdurrahman kaa kavy "sandeshraasak' bhi likhaa gaya jisamen parvarti bolchaal ke nikat kii bhashaa milti he
 Thus the form of old Hindi continued to be developed and developed till the eleventh century
 gyarahavin sadi ke lagbhag deshbhasha hindi kaa rup adhik sfoot hone laga
 At that time many small Rajput states were established in the Western Hindi Territory
 ye paraspar athwa videshi akramanakariyon se praaia: yuddhrat rahaa karte the
 The royal poetry of the barns and the Bhats which were under the patronage of these kings were named as Veeragatha
 in virgthaon ko raso kaha jaataa he
 In this, besides mentioning the valor and valor of the asylum kings, their love affairs are also mentioned
 raso granthon main sangharsh kaa kaaran praaia: prem dikhaaya gaya he
 There is a mixture of history and imagination in these compositions
 raso virgit or prabandhkavy - in do roopon main likhe gayi
 The available copies of many of these Raso texts may be historically doubtful, but the oral tradition of these heroics is undeserved
 inamen shaury or prem kii ojasvi or saras abhivyakti hui he
 It was during this period that Maithil Kokil Vidyapati got a unique expression of human beauty and love in his poetry
 kirtilata or kirtipataakaa inke do anya prasiddh granth hai
 This is also the time of Amir Khusro
 inhone theth khadi boli main anek paheliyaan, mukariyaan or do sakun rache hai

 vidyapati : kirtilata, kirtipataakaa, vidyapati padaavalee By the thirteenth century, there was a great mess in the field of religion
 janata main sidhon or yogiyon aadi dwaara prachlit andhvishwaas fail rahe
 They were, even in the scholarly class, the orthodoxy and primordiality had taken precedence
 mayawad ke prabhaav se lokavimukhataa or niskriyata ke bhav samaaj main panpane lage the
 At such a time a huge cultural movement took place across India in the form of Bhakti movement, which established the social and personal values that were eminent in the society
 bhakthi andolan kaa aarambh dakshin ke alwar santon dwaara dasvin sadi ke lagbhag hua
 Four Vaishnava sects stood there against Shankaracharya's advaitaism and Mayaism
 in chaaron sampradaayon ne uttar bharat main vishnu ke avtaron kaa prachaarprasar kiya
 One of these was promoted by Ramanujacharya, whose disciple Ramananda preached Rambhakti in North India
 ramanand ke ram brahm ke sthanapann the jo rakshason kaa vinaash or apni lila kaa vistaar karne ke liye sansar main avateern hote hai
 In the field of Bhakti, Ramanand laid special emphasis on eradicating discrimination of high order
 ram ke sagun or nirgun do roopon ko maananevaale do bhakton - kabir or tulsi ko inhone prabhavit kiya
 At the same time Vallabhacharya started his Pushtimarg on the basis of Vishnuswami's Shuddhavaita opinion
 barahavin se solahavin sadi tak puure desh main puranasammat krishnacharitra ke aadhaar par kai sampradaay pratishthit hue, jinamein sabase zyada prabhaavshaalee vallabh kaa pushtimaarg tha
 He called the virtuous form of Brahman as real against Shankarism
 unke mat se yah sansar mithyaa yaa maaya kaa prasar nahin he balki brahm kaa hi prasar he, at: satya he
 He considered Krishna to be an incarnation of Brahma and for his attainment it was necessary that the devotee's complete surrender
 bhagavan ke anugrah yaa pushti ke dwaara hi bhakthi sulabh ho sakati he
 In this sect, the sweet form of Gopijanavallabh, Lilapurushotam Krishna was accepted for worship
 is prakaar uttar bharat main vishnu ke ram or krishna avtaron pratishtha hui
 Thus, on the basis of these different views, two branches of Bhaktikavya in Hindi called Nirgun and Saguna went together
 nirgunamat ke do upavibhag hue - gyanashrayi or premashrayi
 The representatives of the first are Kabir and the second is Jaisi
 sagunmat bhi do upadharaon main pravaahit hua - rambhakti or krishnabhakti
 The first representative is Tulsi and the second is Surdas
 gyanashrayi shakha ke pramukh kavi kabir par taatkaalik vibhinn dharmik pravritiyon or darshanik maton kaa sammilit prabhaav he
 The form of religion reformer and social reformer is special in his works
 unhone aacharan kii shuddhta par bal diya
 He was intensely betrayed by externalities, stereotypes and superstitions
 manushya kii kshamta kaa udghosh kar unhone nimnashrenee kii janata main aatmgaurav kaa bhav jagaaya
 The other poets of this branch are Raidas, Dadu
 premashrayi dhara ke sarvapramukh kavi jaaysi hai jinka "padmavat' apni maarmik premavyanjana, katharas or sahaj kalavinyas ke kaaran vishesh prashansit hua he
 Among his other compositions are "akhrawad 'and" Aakhri Kalam' etc
, which contain Sufi sects
 is dhara ke anya kavi hai qutuban, manzan, usmaan, shaikh nabi or nur mohammad aadi
 From today's point of view, the importance of this entire devotee is more due to the human feelings and emotions of the world than its righteousness
 isi vichaar se bhaktikaal ko hindi kavy kaa swarna yug kaha ja saktaa he
 a new twist in Hindi poetry took place around 1700 AD
 ise visheshat: taatkaalik darbari samskruti or sanskritsahitya se uttejnaa mili
 Certain portions of Sanskrit literature have led him to a classical discipline
 hindi main 'reeti' yaa 'kavyariti' shabd kaa prayog kavyashastra ke liye hua tha
 Therefore, keeping in view the poetic general creation process and the majority of the characteristic signs of rasa, ornamentation, etc
, the poetry of this time is called 'ritikavya'
 is kavy kii shringaari pravritiyon kii puraani parampara ke spasht sanket sanskrit, praakrit, apbhransh, farsi or hindi ke adikavy tathaa krishnakavy kii shringaari pravritiyon main milte hai
 Ritikavya's work was started by a Sanskritist
 ye the acharya keshavadas, jinaki sarvaprasiddh rachanaayen kavipriya, rasikapriya or ramchandrika hai
 Several decades after Keshava, from the Chintamani to the eighteenth century, the Ajastra source of ritualism flowed in Hindi, with a very artistic expression of the delightful aspects of male-female life and the Saras sensibilities of it
 reetikaal ke kavi raajaaon or raison ke aashray main rahete the
 There was a natural atmosphere of entertainment and artistry
 bauddhik anand kaa mukhya saadhan vahaan uktivaichitraya samajha jaataa tha
 Literature written in such an environment was mostly erotic and artistic
 par isi samay prem ke svachhand gayak bhi hue jinhone prem kii gaharaaiyon kaa sparsh kiya he
 Both in terms of quantity and poetry, this period's poetic euphemism of male-female love and beauty is important
 reetikavy mukhyat: maansal shringaar kaa kavy he
 It has a beautiful opening to the memorable aspects of male-female life
 adhik kavy muktak style main he, par prabandhkavy bhi hai
 In these two hundred years, Shringarakavya had an extraordinary rise
 par dhire dhire reeti kii jakad badhati gai or hindi kavy kaa bhavakshetra sankeern hota gaya
 By coming to the modern era, the attention of writers was particularly attracted to these two shortcomings
 inhen bhi dekhen - This is the early period of the modern era when Indians came into contact with European culture
 bharat main apni jaden jamaane ke kaam main angareji shashan ne bhartiya jivan ko vibhinn staron par prabhavit or andolit kiya
 The structure of the situational lifestyle began to break down due to the new circumstances
 ek nae yug kii chetana kaa aarambh hua
 New dimensions of conflict and reconciliation emerged
 naye yug ke sahityasrujan kii sarvocch sambhaavnaayen khadi boli gadhy main nihit thim, isliye ise gadhy-yug bhi kaha gaya he
 Ancient prose of Hindi is found in Rajasthani, Maithili and Brajbhasha but he was unable to become a medium of literature
 khadiboli kii parampara pracheen he
 Examples of this have been scattered in poetry ranging from Amir Khusro to Medieval Bhushan
 khadi boli gadhy ke bhi puraane namoonay mili hai
 a lot of such prose is written in Persian and Gurmukhi script
 dakshin kii musalmaan riyasaton main "dakkhini' ke naam se iskaa vikaas hua
 The prose of Ramprasad Niranjani and Daulatram written in the eighteenth century is available
 par nayi yugachetana ke samvahak rup main hindi ke khadi boli gadhy kaa vyapak prasar unnisvin sadi se hi hua
 At the Fort William College in Calcutta, Lallu Lal and Sadal Mishra, by writing prose books, gave some assistance in the development of the preconceptions of Hindi prose dialect prose, for the use of new English officers
 munshi sadasukhlal or insha allaa khan kii gadhy rachanaayen isi samay likhi gai
 Later, the press, journalists, Christian evangelists and new educational institutions helped in the development of Hindi prose
 bengal, punjab, gujarat aadi vibhinn praanton ke nivaasiyon ne bhi isaki unnati or prasar main yoga diya
 The first Hindi newspaper "udant Martand" was published in 1826 from Calcutta
 raja shivaprasad or raja lakshmana singh hindi gadhy ke nirmaan or prasar main apane apane dhang se sahaayak hue
 Aryasamaj and other cultural movements also carried forward modern prose

 The public was upset and angered by the diplomatic tactics and economic exploitation of the British
 samaaj kaa ek varg paashchaatya sanskaron se aakraant ho rahaa tha to doosraa varg roodhiyon main jakadaaa hua tha

 naveen gyaan vigyaan ke prabhaav se navshikshiton main jivan ke prati ek nayaa drushtikon viksit hua jo ateet kii apeksha vartmaan or bhavishya kii ore vishesh unmukh tha
 The faith generated in social development and the awakening community awareness created new enthusiasm for life among Indians
 bhaaratendu ke samakaleen sahitya main visheshat: gadhysahitya main tatkaaleen vaicharik or bhautik parivesh kii vibhinn avasthaaon kii spasht or jivant abhivyakti hui
 The new creations of this era are full of patriotism and social reform
 anek nai paristhitiyon kii takaraahat se raajnneetik or saamaajik vyang kii pravriti bhi udbuddha hui
 The prose of this time has a liveliness of speech
 lekhakon ke vyaktitv se samprukt hone ke kaaran usamen paryaapt rochakata aa gai he
 Most of the essays were written which were also subjective and thoughtful and descriptive
 anek shaileyon main kathasahitya bhi likhaa gaya, adhiktar shikshapradhan
 But the realist vision and uniqueness of the new craft lies in Srinivasa Das's "examination"
 [[devkinandan khatri kaa tilsmi upanyaas 'chandrakanta' isi samay prakashit hua
 a substantial amount of plays and social acts were composed
 bhaaratendu, pratapanarayan mishra, shrinivas das, aadi pramukh naatakkaar hai
 Also many succulent poems of devotion and adornment were also produced
 par jin kavitaaon main saamaajik bhaavon kii abhivyakti hui ve hi naye yug kii srujanshiltaa kaa aarambhik abhas detii hai
 The remaining poems were written in Brajbhasha except for sporadic experiments of Khadi dialect
 vastav main nayaa yug is samay ke gadhy main hi adhik pratifalit ho sakaa
 The most important events of this period are two - one is the acceptance of the standing dialect as a general poetry, and the other is the regulation and refinement of Hindi prose
 is kaary main sarvaadhik shashakt yoga saraswati sampadak mahaviraprasad dvivedi kaa tha
 Dwivedi and his colleagues developed expressiveness of Hindi prose
 niabandh ke kshetra main dvivedi ji ke atirikt balmukund, chandradhar sharma guleri, purnasingh, padmasingh sharma jaise ek se ek saavdhaan, shashakt or jeevant gadhyshaileekar saamne aae
 Many novels were written but his realist tradition could not develop significantly
 yatharthparak aadhunik kahaniyaan isi kaal main janami or vikasman hui
 Apart from Guleri, Kaushik etc
, early stories of Premchand and Prasad also came to light at this time
 naatak kaa kshetra avashya suunaa sa rahaa
 The most influential critic of this time was Dwivedi, whose revisionist and myriad critical criticism influenced many contemporary literature
 mishrabandhu, krishnabihari mishra or padmasingh sharma is samay ke anya sameekshak hai par kul milakar is samay kii samiksha bahyapakshapradhan hi rahi
 Inspired by the reformist ideals, Ayodhyasinh Upadhyaya in his "priyapravasa" introduced Radha's public service and also demonstrated mastery in the use of various forms of Khadiboli
 maithilisharan gupt ne "bharat bharti' main rashtriyata or samajasudhar kaa swar unchaa kiya or "saket' main urmila kii pratishtha kii
 Other poets of this time are Dwivedi ji, Sridhar Pathak, Balamukund Gupta, Nathuram Sharma 'shankar', Gaya Prasad Shukla 'sanehi' etc
 brajabhasha kavyaparampara ke pratinidhi ratnakar or satyanarayan kaviratn hai
 At this time the work of standing dialect was done in accordance with the refinement of poetry and contemporary environment
 nae kavy kaa adhikansh vichaarparak or varnanaatmak he
 In the two decades of 1920–40, many forms of ideological and artistic trends flourished under modern literature

 In the Kathashakhyatya, living memories were created while living in place of eventuality
 nimna or madhyavargeey samaaj ke yatharthparak chitra vyapak rup main prastut kiye gaye
 Lively styles of narration evolved

 Vrindavanlal Varma's historical novel is also mentioned
 hindi naatak is samay jaishankar prasad ke saath srijan ke naveen str par arohan karata he
 His romantic historical drama became of special importance due to its vibrant characterization, planning and sensitivities to dramatic conflicts
 kai anya naatakkaar bhi sakriy dikhaai pade
 In the field of Hindi criticism, Ramchandra Shukla poignantly inaugurated the subtle conditions and artistic features of Sur, Tulsi and Jayasi and emphasized the social values of literature

 After 1940, there was a union movement of progressivism, which is socialized, realistic and utilitarian in opposition to the sentimental, aesthetic and imaginative individualism tendencies of Shadowism
 saamaajik vaishamy or vargsangharsh kaa bhav isamen vishesh mukhar hua
 It embraced literature as an instrument of social revolution
 apni upyogetavaadi drushti kii simaaon ke kaaran pragativaadee sahitya, visheshat: kavita main kalatmak utkarsh kii sambhaavnaayen adhik nahin thim, phir bhi usne sahitya ke saamaajik paksh par bal dekar ek nai chetana jaagrath kii
 Shortly after the start of the Progressive Movement, another individualist trend influenced by the new psychology or psychoanalysis was active in the field of literature, which was called experimentalism after 1943
 isi kaa sanshodhit rup vartmaankaleen nai kavita or nai kahaniyaan hai
 In this way, we see that in the Second World War and its later literature, dissatisfaction and disenchantment towards the misery of life, ugliness and anomalies gave rise to two types of tendencies
 ek kaa naam pragativaad he, jo marks ke bhautikwaadi jeevandarshan se prerana lekar chalaa; doosraa prayogwaad he, jisane paramparaagat aadarshon or sansthaaon ke prati apane ansatosh kii teevr pratikriyaaon ko sahitya ke naveen rupagat prayogon ke madhyam se vyakt kiya
 The new psychology had a profound effect on this

 Among the critics are Ram Vilas Sharma, Namwar Singh, Vijaydev Narayan Sahi

 Achabharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, Vidya Niwas Mishra and Kuberanath Rai earned special fame in this period in the essay mode
 nae manovigyaan se prabhavit prayogon ke liye sachesht kathakaron main agyeya pramukh hai
 Critically affected by psychology are Elachandra Joshi and Jainendra

 The Gujari Mahal may not be a grand building like the Taj Mahal in Agra, but the background of both is based on love
 tajmahal mogul badshaah shahjahan ne apni patni mumtaz kii yaad main 1631 main banvaanaa shuru kiya tha, jo 22 saal baad banakar taiyaar ho sakaa
 The Gujari Mahal of Hisar was built in 1354 by Firoz Shah Tughlaq in love with his girlfriend Gujri, which was completed in just two years
 gujari mahal main kaala pathar istemaal kiya gaya he, jabaki tajmahal beshkimati safed sangemarmar se banaaya gaya he
 Another major disparity between these two historic buildings is that the Taj Mahal was built by Shah Jahan in memory of Mumtaz
 taj ek mazebara he, jabaki gujari mahal firoz shah tululaq ne gujari ke rahane ke liye banwaaya tha, jo mahal hi he
 The fort was built by Emperor Firoz Shah Tughlaq to establish the Gujari Mahal

 One day Shahzada Firoz came here with his horse while playing hunting
 usne gujars kanya ko dere se baahar nikalate dekha to us par mohit ho gaya
 Gujar Kanya also could not live without being influenced by Shahzada Feroze
 ab to firoz kaa shikaar ke bahaane dere par aana ek silsilaa ban gaya
 When Feroze proposed marriage to Gujri, the Gujar girl approved of the marriage, but refused to go to Delhi, saying that she could not leave her old parents
 firoz ne gujari ko yah kahkar manaa liya ki vah use dilli nahin le jayega

 'hisar' is a Persian language word, which means 'fort'
 isse pehle is jagah ko 'isuyar' kaha jaataa tha
 Now the Gujari Mahal is in ruins

 There is evidence that leprosy does not develop in all people infected with M
 leprae and it has long been believed that genetic factors also have a role in it because leprosy has been seen in some specific families and is Success in understanding why lepromatous leprosy develops in some people, while lepromatous leprosy in others Sector are growing
 aisa anumaan he ki anuvaanshik karkon ke kaaran keval 5% logon main hi kushtarog hone kaa khatra hota he
 Mostly this is because the body is naturally immune to this bacterium, and those who become infected with it are experiencing an acute allergic reaction to the disease

 In short, penetration through the respiratory tract is the most likely route, although other routes, especially broken skin, cannot be ignored
 The CDC has expressed the following assumption about the transmission of the disease: "although the route of transmission of Hansen's disease remains uncertain, most researchers believe that M
 leprae usually spreads from person to person via respiratory drops

 " In leprosy, it is difficult to define reference points for both the incubation period and the time of infection and the measurement of the onset of disease; The first one due to adequate immunological devices and the second due to the slow onset of the disease
 Despite this, various researchers have attempted to measure the incubation time for leprosy

 Although annual expansion as a measure of transmission — the number of new cases of leprosy received annually — is important, leprosy is characterized by long incubation periods, late diagnosis and early stages of the disease
 Leprosy is difficult to measure due to lack of laboratory equipment to be able to do this
 iske bajaay, panjikrut prasar kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Registered prevalence is a useful representative indicator of the burden of the disease because it indicates the number of active cases of leprosy diagnosed with the disease at any point in time and receiving MDT treatment

 pichley varsh ke dauraan pahachaane gaye nae maamalon kii sankhya 296,499 thi
 The reason for this annual identification number exceeding its prevalence at the end of that year can be explained by the fact that a part of new cases completed their treatment within a year and hence they are no longer on the register
 The number of new cases identified globally continues to decline and in 2005 it decreased by 110,000 cases compared to the previous year

 gudiya ek bhartiya muslim mahila kaa naam tha jo kargil yuddh ke kaaran vyaktigat tathaa paariwarik rup se buree tarah se prabhavit hui thi or jisaki durdasha ko pramukhataa se print or electronic samachar-madhyamon ne darshaya tha
 In 1999, Gudiya was married to an armyman named Arif, but unfortunately within ten days of the Kargil War, Arif was sent to the battlefield
 aarif yuddh se vaapasi karne main vifal rahaa tha or adhikariyon ne use galati se faraari ghoshit kiya
 Later it was discovered that he was imprisoned by the war Pakistan

 a new turning point occurred in Gudiya's life when Pakistanis began the withdrawal of military prisoners from India after the end of the war
 isi ke tahat aarif bhi reeha hua he or uskaa garmjoshi se swaagat kiya gaya
 At that time, Gudiya was living with her parents in Kalunda village on the outskirts of Delhi due to her pregnancy
 is samachar ke sunate hi gudiya mirat zile ke mundali gaanv chali gayi jahaan uske pehle pati kaa makaan sthit tha
 In front of the media gathered in the Gram Panchayat, Gudiya expressed her intention to relocate with her first husband
 Islamic scholars present in the crowd at the time said that the decision of the doll is according to the Shari'a and appreciated its decision
 duusari shaadi, unke anusaar, avaidh thi
 Sources of rediff dot work have taken another picture of this entire appearance
 jaanch se pataa chalaa he ki gudiya kaa faisalaa darasal uske pehle pati, purv susraali-samandhiyon, gaanvvaalon or pramukhtah dharmik netaaon ke dabaav ke kaaran liya gaya tha
 Gudiya himself gave a glimpse of the hidden pressure in her decision, saying that "it was everyone's decision"
 gaur-talab he ki gudiya ke duusare pati taufiq ko apni garbhvatee patni ke is vivaadaspat nirnay lene kii puri pratikruya se dur rakhaa gaya
 In addition, Gudiya's uncle Riyasat Ali said that there was pressure from the people there and he was asked to recite the pre-announced verdict
 unamem visheshkar maulaviyon ne kaha ki gudiya sharia kaa paalan kare or aarif ko sweekaar kare |sabase gambhir baat in maulaviyon ne ye kahi ki gudiya agar aisa na kare to uskaa honevaala baccha nazaij ban jayega | duusari taraf toufeeq ko gudiya ne is prakaran se paanch din pehle telephone par baat kii or apni vivashtaa prakat kii thi
 The pressure to meet the husband again was so great that the father threatened to commit suicide if he did not
 aarif, jiskaa kahana tha ki use gudiya ke pyaar ne use waapas khench laayaa, ne ghoshnaa kii ki use apni purv patni to sweekaar he par uske pet main pal rahaa baccha sweekaar nahin he
 The doll gave birth to a baby boy a month after the reunion
 aarif ne shuruaati hichak ke baad gudiya ke bachche ko is shart par sweekaar karne kii ghoshnaa kii ki bada hone ke baad vah toufik ke paas waapas bhej saktaa he
 Gudiya succumbed to anemia in the coming few months

 One possible cause of mental pressure for Gudiya is to repeatedly taunt her brother-in-law that she is ill-fated as Arif had gone to fight in the war within a few days of her marriage and gone missing

 bhashavigyaan main 'akshar' yaa shabdaansh dhvaniyon kii sangathit ikai ko kehete hai
 Any word can be spoken by breaking it into fractions and syllables are the parts of the word that cannot be made any shorter, otherwise the sounds of the word are changed
 udhaahrantah 'achaanak' shabd ke teen shabdaansh hai - 'a', 'chaa' or 'nak'
 If 'a-cha-nak' is spoken intermittently, the three syllables of the word can be seen fragmentarily but the pronunciation of the word seems to be correct
 agar 'nak' ko aage todaa jaae to shabd kii dhvaniyaan galat ho jaatin hai - 'a-chaa-na-k'
 is shabd ko 'a-chaan-k' bhi nahin bolaa jaataa kyonki is se bhi uccharan galat ho jaataa he
 Some short words have the same syllable, such as 'in', 'ear', 'hand', 'walk' and 'ja'
 Some words have two syllables, such as 'walker', food, handkerchief and vegetable
 kuch main teen yaa us se bhi adhik shabdaansh hote hai, jaise 'mahatvapurn' or 'antarrashtriya' 
 The word Akshar means - 'which cannot happen, nor can be destroyed'
 iskaa prayog pehle 'vaani' yaa 'vaak' ke liye evam shabdaansh ke liye hota tha
 The letter continued to be used for 'varna' as well
 yahi kaaran he ki lipi sanketon dwaara vyakt varnon ke liye bhi aaj 'akshar' shabd kaa prayog saamaanya jan karte hai
 Scientific study of the language has given the letter the meaning of English 'syllable', in which vowels, vowels and consonants, including vowels or consonant sounds with reminders, are considered
 ek hi aghat yaa bal main boli jane vaali dhwani yaa dhwani samudaay kii ikai ko akshar kaha jaataa he
 The basis of unit separation is the vowel or vowel consonant
 vyanjan dhwani kisi uccharan main swar kaa purv yaa par ang banakar hi aati he
 Astu, the vowel in the letter is the spine
 akshar se swar ko na to pruthak hi kiya ja saktaa he or na bina swar yaa swararat vyanjan ke akshar kaa nirmaan hi sambhav he
 If the consonant is like a pearl in pronunciation, the vowel is like a thread
 yadi swar shashakt samraat he to vyanjan ashakt raja
 It is on this basis that a letter is often considered synonymous with vowels, but it is not so, yet vowels have great importance in letter formation
 katipay bhashaaon main vyanjan dhvaniyaan bhi akshar nirmaan main sahaayak siddh hoti hai
 In English, consonant sounds like Na, Su and l are also pronounced vowrat and help in syllable formation like vowel sounds
 angreji silabal ke liye hindi main akshar shabd kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Dr
 Ramvilas Sharma has used the word 'swarik' for syllable
 
 Since the word alphabet has been used for many meanings in the history of language and grammar, its use in the meaning of syllable leads to the possibility of confusion
 shabd ke uccharan main jis dhwani par shikharata yaa ucchata hoti he vahi akshar yaa silabal hota he, jaise haath main aa dhwani par
 This word has a letter
 'akalpit' shabd main teen akshar hai - a, kal, pit ; aazaadee main teen - aa ja di; arthath shabd main jahaan jahaan swar ke uccharan kii pruthakta pai jaae vahaan-vahaan akshar kii pruthakta hoti he
 When considered from the point of view of sound production, the unit of pleural circulation is called syllable or vocal, which has the same sound
 sharir rachana kii drushti se akshar yaa swarik ko phuffus spandan bhi kah sakate hai, jiskaa uccharan dhwani tantra main avarodhan hota he
 When the component is highest in the movement letter at the time of pronunciation of the sound block or the lowest sound group, then that sound is alphabetic
 swar dhvaniyaan bahudhaa aksharvat uccharit hoti he evam vyanjan dhvaniyaan kvachit
 The absolutely separate unit of lexical pronunciation is called a letter, as kisi shabd main aksharon kii sankhya is baat par katai nirbhar nahin karti ki usamen kitni dhvaniyaan hai, balki is baat par ki shabd kaa uccharan kitne aghat yaa jatke main hota he arthath shabd main kitni avyavhit dhwani ikaiyaan hai
 In addition to the head sound used in the letter, the remaining sounds are called ‘aksharang’ or ‘gahvar sound’
 udhaaharan ke liye 'chaar' main ek akshar he jisamen aa sheersh dhwani tathaa c evam r gahvar dhvaniyaan hai
 In any syllable there is a 'syllabus center', which is always the vowel character and other characters are found around it which can be consonants and also vowels
 The syllable center of the syllable 'ear' is the vowel of 'aa', from which the letters 'a' and 'n' come later

 The credit for the discovery of penicillin goes to Scottish scientist and Nobel laureate Alexander Fleming in 1928
 unhone dikhaaya ki yadi penicillium notatom upyukt sabstrate main bade, to yah antibiotic gunon ke saath ek padaarth nicksruth karegaa, jise unhone penicillin qaraar diya
 This casual observation heralded a modern era of antibiotic discovery

 The us Charles Thom, working as an American expert in the Department of Agriculture, was an acknowledged expert and Fleming referred the matter to him
 Fleming coined the term "penicillin" to describe the decantation of broth culture of penicillium molds
 Even in these early stages, penicillin was found to be quite effective in fighting gram-positive bacteria and ineffective in fighting gram-negative components and fungi

 They hoped to find a molecule that could compete with penicillin for the right organic acid transporter for excretion, something so that the transporter would preferably emit coping molecules and preserve penicillin

 β-lactem antibiotic jeevanugat koshika diwaar main paptidoglican cross-link ke gathan ko rokte hue kaam karata he
 The β-lactam moiety of penicillin binds to the enzyme (transpeptidase), which binds to the peptidoglycan molecules of bacteria, weakening the cell wall of the bacterium, further enhancing the activation of peptidoglycan precursor hydrolysis and autolysins of the bacterial cell wall
 , Which subsequently digests the existing peptidoglycan of bacteria

 Unlike the galaxies, the first real nebula was mentioned by the Persian astronomer Abd al-rahman al-sufi in his "situated Star Book"
 unhone andromeeda gallexi ke sthaan par "ek chota badal" dekha tha
 He characterized the Omricran Velorum constellation Punj as a "nebulous star" or obscure star and other obscure objects in Bruchi's cluster

 In 1715, Edmund Halley published a list of six nebulae
 Throughout the century, the number continued to increase, with the compilation of a list of 20 released in 1746 by Jean Philippe de Chasaux
 Nicolas Louis de Lacale listed 42 nebulae from the Cape of Good Hope in 1751–53
 Most of which were previously unknown
 iske baad charles mesier ne 1781 tak 103 niharikaon kii suchi banaai, haalanki unke aisa karne kii pramukh vajah thi - dhoomaketuon kii galat pahchaan se bachanaa
 Subsequently, the efforts of William Herschel and his sister Caroline Herschel increased the number of nebulae
 unki kaitalong of van thaujend new nebylai and cluster of stars 1786 main prakashit hui
 ek hajaar kii duusari suchi 1789 main or 510 kii teesri tathaa antim suchi 1802 main prakashit kii gayi thi
 Throughout much of his work, William Herschel was convinced that these nebulae were mere underdeveloped stars
 haalanki, 1790 main, unhone aspashtataa se ghire ek taare kii khoj kii or yah nishkarsh nikaala ki yah adhik duuri par sthit samooh na hokar ek vaastavik ghatatope yaa niharika thi
 In early 1864, William Huggins investigated the spectra or range of about 70 nebulae
 They found that about a third of them had a wide range of gas inclusions
 baaki main ek satat vistrut shrenee dikhaai di or inhen sitaron kaa ek samooh mana gaya
 In 1912, a third category was added when Vesto Slifer demonstrated that the nebulae around the Meropee star resembled the Pleiades open starfish
 is prakaar niharika taron ke prativimvit prakaash dwaara chamakta he
 Slifer and Edwin Hubble continued to collect a wide range of these from several diffused nebulae and discovered that 29 of these showed emission spectra and 33 had continuous spectra of starlight
 1922 main habal ne ghoshnaa kii ki lagbhag sabhi niharikaayen sitaron se judy hai or unki roshni taron ke prakaash se aati he
 They also discovered that nebulae in the emission spectrum are almost always warmer than B1 or more, whereas nebulae with continuous spectra appear with relatively cold stars
 habal or henry noris rasel donon ne yah nishkarsh nikaala ki garm taron ke aasapaas kii niharikaayen kisi na kisi prakaar se parivartit ho rahi hai
 Many nebulae are formed due to the mutual gravity of the gas in the interstellar medium
 apane nijee bhaar ke tahat dravya ke sankuchit hone kii vajah se centre main anek vishaal sitaron kaa gathan ho saktaa he or unka parabangnee prakaash aasapaas kii gaison ko ynit kar prakaash tarangon par unhen drushtigochar banaata he
 Rosette Nebiel and Pelicon Nebiel are examples of such nebulae
 HII kshetra ke naam se parichit is prakaar kii niharikaon kaa aakaar, gas ke vaastavik badalon ke aakaar par nirbhar hota he
 This is where stars are formed
 isse gathit sitaron ko kabhi-kabhi ek yuva, deele cluster ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Some nebulae are formed as a result of explosions in supernovae, ie the end of large and short-gv stars
 supernova ke visphot se bikharanevaali saamagree urja dwaara ynit hoti he or isse nirmit ho sakanevaali thos vastu kaa gathan hota he
 The Crab Nebula of Taurus constellation is the best example of this
 varsh 1054 main supernova kii ghatana darj kii gayi or ise or SN1054 ke rup main chihnit kiya gaya
 The solid object formed after the explosion is located in the center of the Crab Nebule and is a neutron star
 anya niharikaayen grahiy niharikaon kaa gathan kar sakati hai
 Like the Earth's sun, it is the last phase of the life of a low-mass mass star
 8-10 saura dravyaman vaale taare laal daanav taron ke rup main viksit hote hai or apane vaataavaran main spandan ke dauraan dhire-dhire apni baheri parat kho dete hai
 When a star loses enough material, its temperature rises and the ultraviolet radiation emitted from it can ionize the nebula thrown around it
 niharika main avshisht saamagree sahit 97% hydrogen or 3% helium he
 The main goal of this phase is to achieve balance
 niharikaon ko chaar pramukh samoohon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he
 Earlier galaxies and round galaxies were considered to be different types of practicals
 gallexion kii sarpakar sanrachana kii vyakhya ke liye sarpakar niharika kaa upyog kiya jaataa tha
 This classification does not include all known structures like clouds
 jiskaa ek udahaaran herbig-haaro object he
 Diffuse nebulae near the stars are examples of reflection nebulae
 adhikansh niharikaon ko visarit niharikaayen kaha ja saktaa he, jiskaa arth he ki ve vistrut hai evam kisi sarvamaanya paribhaasha kii seemaa main nahin aatin
 In visible light, these nebulae can be divided into emission nebulae and reflection nebulae, based on how the visible light is composed to us
 utsarjan niharika main ayanit gas hota he, jo utsarjan kii dhundhlee rekha banaati hai
 These emission nebulae are often called HII fields, with the term "HII" often used for ionized hydrogen in commercial astronomy
 utsarjan niharikaon kii tulana main, pratibimb niharikaayen swayan paryaapt maatra main dikhaai dene yogya prakaash rekha nahin banaatin balki apane aasapaas ke sitaron ke prakaash ko pratibimbit karti hai
 Dark or dark nebulae are the same as diffuse nebulae, but they cannot be seen by the light emitted or reflected by them
 Instead, they are seen as dark clouds in front of distant stars or emission nebulae
 haalanki ye niharikaayen prakaash tarangon par alag-alag dikhaai detii hai, par ve sabhi infrared yaa avarakt taragon par utsarjan ke ujjwal strot hai
 This emission mainly comes from the dust inside the nebulae
 grahiy niharikaayen, ve niharikaayen hai, jo lo-moss ananthasparshi vishaal shakha sitaron ke safed boune main parivartit hone ke samay unase nikalanevaale gas yukt khol se gathit hoti hai
 These nebulae are emitting nebulae with blurred emission, similar to those of emission nebulae found in star-forming regions
 takneekee taur par, yah HII kshetra hai kyonki adhiktar hydrogen ynit hoga
 However, planetary nebulae are more dense and more solid than emission nebulae found in star-forming regions
 grahon kii niharikaon ko yah naam isliye diya gaya he kyonki jin pehle khagolavidon ne in vastuon kaa adhyayan kiya tha unhone sochaa ki niharikaayen grahon kii tastariyon yaa discon jaisi dikhti hai, haalanki, ve grahon se sanvandhit nahin hai
 a proto planetary nebula is an astronomical object, a short-lived episode of the rapid stellar gradual evolution of a star between the position of the former asymptomatic giant branch and the phase of the post-planetary nebula
 ek PPN shashakt avarakt vikiran utsarjit karata he or ek pratibimb niharika he
 The actual point of formation of a PPN planetary nebula is defined by the temperature of the central star
 jab ek hai-moss sitara apane jivan ke ant tak pahunch jaataa he tab supernova ghatit hota he
 When nuclear fusion stops at the star's core or center, the star disintegrates
 andar risnevaali gas yaa to pratikshipt hoti he athwa itani adhik garm ho jaati he ki yah kendra se baahar kii ore failati he tathaa taare ke visphot kaa kaaran banati he
 The expanding shell of the gas forms a special type of diffused nebula supernova remnant
 haalanki, supernova avshesh kaa adhikansh prakaash evam eks-re utsarjan ynit gas se utpann hota he, radioutsarjan kaa bada bhaag synchroton utsarjan ke naam se parichit non-thermal utsarjan he
 This emission arises from high-velocity electrons oscillating in magnetic fields
