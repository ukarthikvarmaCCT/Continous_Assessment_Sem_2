 However, each step takes three steps, allowing Samba to experience that he has danced at 3 / 4 time intervals
 iskaa mul maksaksi se judaa he
 Since its inception in the 19th century, samba music has been danced in Brazil since its inception
 vastav main samba koi ek vishesh prakaar kii nrity style nahin balki nrityon kaa ek puraa set he, jo brazil main drishygat hota he, atah kisi ek vishesh nrity ko "mul" samba style ke rup main nischitata ke saath daawa nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Apart from the Brazilian samba dance styles, the second major stream is the Ballroom Samba, which is notably different
 samba no pe ek ekal nrity he jo aksar sambha sangeet ke bajane par achaanak hi nacha jaataa he
 In basic operation, the body stays in a straight line and only one knee turns at a time
 pair bahut halake thirakate hai - ek baar main keval kuch hi inch
 prati pravidhi par 3 charnon ke saath taal 2 / 4 hi rahata he
 This can be taken as step hair change
 ise and -a-van, and-a-tu or phir back-tu-van kahkar bhi varnit kiya ja saktaa he
 On both sides, the fundamental operation remains the same, when a foot rises outward and the leg is completely straight before the first beat
 doosraa pair halkaa-sa saamne kii ore chalata he or pehle pair ke kareeb
 doosraa pair ghutane par halkaa-sa jhukta he jisase ki kuulhe kaa baayan hissaa neeche kii ore jhukta he or dahinaa hissaa upar kii ore uthta hua dikhaai detaa he
 The weight is shifted to the inner leg for a while for the next "and one" and then the same weight falls on the outside leg in the rhythm of the "two" and this process of foot movement is repeated towards the other side
 is
 yah nrity keval sangeet kii taal kaa anusaran karata he or is prakaar bahut jaldi ausat se kaaphi tej gati pakad saktaa he
 Men dance with full feet on the ground, while women often have to dance on the padded paws just next to the foot, wearing heels
 peshewar nartak kadamon ko thodaa badal sakate hai, 3 kii bajaay prati dhaap 4 kadam chalakar or aksar sangeet ke mizaaj ke mutabik bahon ke sanchaalan kar
 There are also zonal forms of dance in Brazil, in which the necessary steps are the same, but due to the change in the pronunciation of the music, people will dance with the same kind of beat and beat by just tweaking the tone
 For example, girls in Bahia tend to bend their legs outward rather than with their knees close together, as in Rio de Janeiro
 yah samba nrity kaa ek prakaar he jaisaaki koi brazil ke carnival parade main evam duniya bhar main hone vaale anya samba carnival main dikhaai detaa he
 It is also one of the most popular versions of Samba

 It appeared around 1940 and was named after Gafiera, the popular urban nightclub in Rio de Janeiro at the time
 yah nrity max se vyutpann or koro ke aagaman kaa anukaran karata he
 It discarded most of the elements of the Maxxe polka but retained the operation of one of the legs wrapped in the tango of Argentina, although adopting a more relaxed posture than the latter
 Many consider this style of samba to be a combination of waltz and tango
 brazil ke kai nrity studio samba di gafiyera ke pad-sanchaalan evam nrity kii niyamavali sikhaane main in donon nrity ke tatv or takanic kaa upyog karte hai

 This style is present in dance academies around the world

 After the arrival of Pagode it became a style of dance and began in the city of São Paulo

 kai saalon ke liye yah brazil ke uttar purv ke liye chuttee ke maheenon ke dauraan ek prakaar kaa pramukh nrity ban gaya
 The dance is directed entirely in style and the dynamics of the operation mimic the song
 yah ek bahut urjavan nrity kii tarah he jisame samba no pe ke tatwon or aerobics kaa mishran he or kyonki geet, jo manoranjan ke liye bane hai, une saath nrity main aam taur par ek prakaar kaa kauthuk tatv ghulaa hota he
 Many music parties such as "ao Chan" have a marketing policy that every choreography of theirs is always released along with their songs, so Samba Aix is always a changing dance with no commitment to maintain a formal post-handling format or normality it occurs iske alaava yah bahia se utpan, samba drum ke saath regge kii dhun kaa ek mishran he
 Daniela Mercury, with her very popular songs such as "soul da liberde" "O reggae e o mar" and "perola Negara", tied the world to the rhythm

 According to the custom of that time, he had left his elder son Modu near the Yuezhi court, which made the Yuezhi confident that Tuaman would be loyal to him
 lekin tuman apane ek chote putr or modu ke chote sautele bhai ke paksh main tha kyonki vah us putr kii maan ke bahekaave main aa gaya tha
 Modu realized this
 tuman ne achaanak ukiyon par hamalaa kar diya - kaha jaataa he ki usne samajhe kii ve badla lene ke liye modu ko maar denge

 phir usne uttari mongolia ke dingling logon ko haraakar shaktishaalee ueshi logon par nishaanaa saadhaa
 In 203 BCE, the Yuzhi people were defeated and subjugated
 modu kii in safaltaaon ko dekhakar sabhi shiyongnu saradaaron ne usko apana sarvocch shaasha maan liya
 In 200 BCE he defeated the Han emperor Gaodi after a three-year battle with the Han Dynasty of China

 For the next 70 years, the Chinese had to somehow keep their empire by marrying their princesses in Xionguns
 modu ne puure china par qabza karne kii koshish nahin kari kyonki use laga kii itane bade ilaake par ek videshi taaqat kaa shashan tik paanaa kathin hota

 Cancer is a class of diseases in which a group of cells exhibit uncontrolled growth, disease invasion and sometimes mutation or metastasis
 karkat ke ye teen durdam lakshan ise saumy gaanth se vibhedit karte hai, jo swayan simit hai, aakraamak nahin hai yaa apararoopantaran prardashit nahin karte hai
 Most cancers make a knot or abdura, but some, such as blood, do not form a knot

 Cancer can affect people of all ages, even the fetus, but the risk of most varieties increases with age
 karkat main se 13% kaa kaaran he
 According to the American Cancer Society, 76 million people worldwide died of cancer during 2007
 karkat sabhi jaanwaron ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Almost all cancerous cells are caused by abnormalities in the genetic material
 ye asaamanyataayen carcinogen yaa kaa karkatjan ke kaaran ho sakati hai jaise tambaaku dhumrapaan, vikiran, rasayan, yaa sankramak kaarak
 karkat ko utpann karne vaali anya anuvanshik asaamanyataayen kabhi kabhi DNA karkat pratikruti main truti ke kaaran ho sakati hai, yaa anuvanshik rup se praapt ho sakati hai or is prakaar se janm se hi sabhi koshikaon main upasthit hoti hai
 The heredity of cancer is generally affected by the complex interactions between carcinogens and the nutrient genome
 karkat rogajanan kii anuvanshiki ke nae pahalu jaise DNA methilikaran or micro RNA, kaa mahatva teji se bad rahaa he
 Genetic abnormalities found in cancer usually affect two common classes of genes

 Thereafter, knot suppressor genes are inactivated in cancer cells, resulting in a loss of normal function of those cells, such as correct DNA replication, control of the cell cycle, orientation and adhesion within tissues, and the immune system

 ye kramshah utak vigyaan or sthaan hai
 Common category examples include: in main se adhikansh ganthen bacchon main aam hai
 The names of dormant knots typically use words such as -carcinoma, -sarcoma or -blastoma as suffixes, with the Latin or Greek word for organ of origin as the root word
 udhaaharan ke liye, yakrut kaa karkat hepetocarcinoma kehalaata he; vasa koshikaon kaa karkat liposarcoma kehalaata he
 For common cancers, the English name of the organ is used
 udhaaharan ke liye stan cancer kaa sabase saamaanya prakaar stan kaa vahini parak carcinoma yaa mameri dakatal carcinoma kehalaata he
 Here the adjective ducktail is used to refer to the cancer seen in the microscope, which is similar to normal breast vessels
 vahini shabd kaa upyog, sookshmdarshi main dikhaai dene vaali stan vahiniyon ke karkat ke liye kiya gaya he
 The benign knot is the -oma suffix used in his name, with the root word being the name of the organ
 udhaaharan ke liye, garbhashay kii chikani peshi kii ek saumy gaanth leyomyoma kehalaati he
 Unfortunately, the -oma suffix is also used for certain types of cancers, such as melanoma and seminoma
 mote taur par, karkat ke lakshanon ko teen samoohon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: Although developed cancer may be painful, it is often not the initial symptom
 uparokt suchi main se prayek lakshan kai prakaar kii sthitiyon ke kaaran ho saktaa he 
karkat prayek mad ke liye ek aam yaa asaamaanya kaaran ho saktaa he
 Cancer is a class of different diseases that vary widely in their causes and biology
 koi bhi jeev, yahaan tak ki paudhon, main bhi karkat cancer ho saktaa he
 Almost all cancer cancers grow slowly, cancer and cancer cells and its daughter cells cause an error
 koi bhi cheez jo pratikruti karti he sambhavatya trutiyon se peedit ho sakati hai 
 yadi truti sudhaar or rokthaam thik prakaar se na kiya jaye trutiyaan bani rahengi or putree koshikaon ko bhi sthanantarit ho sakati hai
 Generally, the body tries to avoid against cancer through several methods, such as: apoptosis, accessory molecules, possibly chronicity, etc
 haalanki ye truti sudhaar vidhiyaan chote myanon main aksar asafal ho jaati hai, vishesh rup se aise vaataavaran main jahaan trutiyon ke utpann hone or badhane kii sambhaavnaaen adhik hoti hai
 For example, such an atmosphere may contain disruptive elements known as carcinogens
 yaa aavadhik chot ho sakati he, yaa vaataavaran jisamen koshikaayen apane astitv ke liye viksit nahin hui hon, jaise hypoxia 
 In this way, cancer is a progressive disease and these progressive errors keep accumulating in the cell gradually until the cell present in the animal starts to work in opposite to its functions
 ve trutiyaan jo karkat kaa kaaran hoti hai, aksar swa-pravardhansheel hoti hai, antat ek ghaateey dar par badhati hai
 for example: is prakaar se karkat aksar kuch trutiyon ke kaaran ek shrinkhalaa abhikriya ke rup main visphotit hota he, ye trutiyaan sanyukt hokar adhik gambhir trutiyaan banaati hai
 Errors that cause more errors are effectively the root cause of cancer and, at the same time, the reason that cancer treatment is very difficult: even after killing all of the cancer's 10,000,000,000 cells
 , Only 10 cells of them can do their replication or send the error-causing signals to other cells then the process starts again
 yah vidroh sadrush paridrishy avaanchhneeya yogyatam kii uttarjivita he, jahaan vikasvaadi bal khud sharir ke dizin or vyavastha ko lagu karne ke viruddh kaary karte hai In fact, once the cancer begins to develop, this same force helps the progression of the cancer towards more aggressive states, and this is called clonal development
 karkat ke kaarnon ke bare main anusandhan aksar nimnlikhit shreniyon main aate hai: Cancer mutations cause DNA mutation that affects cell growth and metastasis
 ve padaarth jo DNA utparivartan kaa kaaran hai utparivartajan kehalaate hai or ve utparivartajan jo karkat kaa kaaran hai, carcinogen kehalaate hai
 Many special types of substances are associated with specific types of deflection

 Fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamine and multicomponent hydrocarbons, are found in tobacco smoking
 Tobacco is responsible for one in three cancer deaths in the developed world, and about one in five deaths worldwide
 darasal, sanyukt rajya america main phuffus kii cancer mrityu kii dar ne dhumrapan ke praturup ko pratibimbit kiya he, jiske anusaar dhumrapan main vruddhi ke saath phuffus cancer mrityu dar main vruddhi hoti he or adhik haal hi main darshaya gaya ki dhumrapan main kami se purushon main phuffus cancer mrityu dar main bhi kami hoti he
 Although the number of smokers is still increasing around the world, the situation caused by some organizations has been described as a tobacco epidemic

 Nevertheless, some experts recommend avoiding exposure to such things for a long time based on the precautionary principle
 kuch karkat rogazanq ke sankraman ke kaaran ho sakate hai
 Many cancers are caused by a virus infection; This is especially seen in birds such as animals, but also in humans, viruses are responsible for 15% of human cancers worldwide
 maanav ke cancer se sambandhit mukhya virus hai maanav pepiloma virus, hepatitis bi or hepatitis si virus, epstin-baar virus or maanav tii -limphotropic virus
 Experimental and epidemiological data indicate a causative role of viruses and have emerged as the second most important risk factor for the development of cancer in humans, with the first factor being tobacco use
 virus-prerit ganthon ko do prakaaron main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, tivrata se roopantarit hone vaale or dhire dhire roopantarit hone vaale 
 In rapidly converting viruses, the virus carries a hyperactive oncogene called viral-oncogene and the infected cell quickly mutates with the expression of v-onc
 iske vipareet, dhire dhire roopantarit hone vaale virus main, virus jinom, poshi ke jinom main ek proto-onkosin ke paas pravisht hota he
 Now viral promoters or other transcriptional regulation elements cause over-expression of that proto-oncogene
 isamen aniyantrit koshika vibhaajan shaamil he
 Because the location of insertion is not specific to proto-oncogenes, and no proto-oncogene has a low chance of insertion, slow-converting viruses, as compared to fast-converting viruses, have a longer duration of infection
 Produce knots after time
 hepatitis bi or hepatitis si sahit hepatitis virus, ek dirghakaalik viral sankraman ko prerit kar saktaa he, jo prativarsh hepatitis bi ke 0
47% rogiyon main or prati varsh hepatitis si ke 1
4% rogiyon main yakrut cancer kaa kaaran he
 Liver cirrhosis, whether due to chronic viral hepatitis infection or due to drinking, is associated with the development of liver cancer and the combination of cirrhosis and viral hepatitis is the cause of the highest risk of liver cancer development
 duniya bhar main viral hepatitis ke sancharan or rog ke baari boj ke kaaran, yakrut cancer sabase aam or sabase adhik ghaatak canceron main se ek he

 However, there are many syndromes that have genetically acquired predisposition to cancer or special susceptibility, often caused by a defect in a gene that protects against the formation of the knot
 prasiddh udhaaharan hai: Transmission of the disease occurs occasionally with conception and only in a marginal form with some organ donors, otherwise cancer is not generally an infectious disease

 onkosin saamaanya jin ho sakate hai, jo anupyukt rup se ucch str par prakat hote hai, yaa parivartit jin jinamein noval gun hote hai
 In any case, expression of these genes promotes the malignancy pattern of cancer cells
 ganth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ve jin he jo cancer kii koshikaon ke koshika vibhaajan, astitv, yaa anya gunon ko sandamit karte hai
 Lump suppressor genes are often disabled by genetic changes that promote cancer
 aamtaur par, ek saamaanya koshika ko cancer koshika main roopantarit karne ke liye kai jeenon main parivartan hone jaruri hai
 There is a diverse classification scheme for different genomic changes, which can contribute to the production of cancer cells
 in main se adhikansh parivartan utparivartan hote hai, yaa jinomik DNA ke newcliotide anukraman main parivartan hote hai
 Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a genomic change that is not a mutation and may involve the gain or loss of one or more chromosomes by error in mitosis
 bade paimaane ke utparivartano main shaamil hai ek gunasutra ke ek bhaag kii kshati yaa vruddhi
 jinomik pravardhan tab hota he jab ek koshika ek chote gunasutri locas kii kai pratilipiyaan praapt kar leti he, saamanyatya isamen ek yaa adhik onkosin hote hai or asann anuvanshik saamagree hoti he
 Localization occurs when two different chromosomal regions, abnormally, converge at a specific location
 iskaa ek janaa mana udhaaharan he philadelphia gunasutra yaa gunasutra 9 or 22 kaa sthanikaran, jo teevr majja janit rakt cancer main hota he, iske parinamswaroop bcr-abl sanglan protein, ek onkogenic tyrosine kinage kaa utpaadan hota he
 Small-scale mutations include point mutations, decreases or increases, which can occur in the promoter of a gene, affecting its expression
 yaa jin ke anukram koden main ho sakati he or iske protein utpaada ke sthayitv yaa kriya ko roopantarit kar sakati he
 Disruption of the sole gene can result in the integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retro virus, and this type of event can result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its progeny
 adhi-anuvaanshiki, DNA saranchana main rasinic, gaiyr utparivartaneey parivartanon ke madhyam se jin abhivyakti ke niyaman kaa adhyayan he
 The principle of over-genetics in cancer pathogenesis is that non-mutational changes in DNA cause changes in gene expression
 saamaanya rup se, onkosin shant hote hai, udhaaharan ke liye aisa DNA methilikaran ke kaaran hota he
 Damage in this methylation induces aberrant expression of oncogene, which is the cause of cancer pathogenesis
 adhi-anuvaanshik parivartan kii gyaat pranali main shaamil he diene methilikaran or gunasutra ke DNA par vishesh sthiti par jude hue histone protein kaa methilikaran yaa asitelikaran
 Classes of therapy known as HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyl transferase inhibitors may re-regulate over-genetic signaling in cancer cells
 onkosin kai prakaar se koshika vruddhi ko badhaava dete he
 Many hormones can be made, a chemical messenger between cells that induces mitotic division, the effect of which depends on signal transduction of receptor tissue or cells
 duusare shabdon main, jab ek praptakarta koshika par ek hormone grahi uttejit hota he, sanket koshika kii sataha se koshika ke kendrak ko sanvahit hota he, yah kendriya str par jin pratilekhan viniman main kuch parivartanon ko prabhavit karata he
 Some oncogenes themselves are part of the signal transit mechanism, or part of the signal receptor in cells and tissues, thus controlling the sensitivity of such hormones
 onkosin aksar samasutrajan utpann karte hai, yaa protein sanshleshan main DNA ke pratilekhan main sanlagn hote hai, jo protein or anzime banaata he, ye protein or anzime un utpaadon or jaev rasayanon ke nirmaan ke liye uttaradaayi hai, jinke saath koshikaayen antarkriya karti hai or jinka koshikaayen upyog karti hai
 Mutations in proto-oncogenes, which are generally the stable equivalents of oncogenes, can modify their expression and action, and the products increase the action or amount of the protein
 jab aisa hota he, aadya-onchogin onchogin ban jate hai or yah sankraman koshika main koshika chakra viniman ke saamaanya santulan ko bigaad detaa he, jisase aniyantrit koshika vruddhi sambhav ho jaati he
 Even if possible, the possibility of cancer cannot be reduced by removing proto-oncogenes from the genome, as they are complex for the growth, repair and establishment of the organism
 aisa keval tab hota he jab ve utparivartit ho jate hai or vruddhi ke sanket atyadhik ho jate hai
 One of the first oncogenes to be defined in cancer research is the Ras oncogene
 Mutations in the Ras family of protein-oncogenes are very common, occurring in 20% to 30% of all human lumps
 raas ko mul rup se harvey sarcoma virus jinom main pahachaanaa gaya tha or shodhakarta is baat se aashcharyachakit ho gaye ki na keval maanav jinom main yah jin upasthiti tha balki, ek utprerak niyantran tatv se judaa hua tha, jo koshika rekha sanvardhan main cancer ko prerit kar saktaa tha
 The knot suppressor gene encodes for anti-proliferation signals and proteins, which suppress mitosis and cell growth
 saamanytah, gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin pratilekhan kaarak hai jo koshikeey tanaav yaa DNA kshati ke dwaara sakriy hote hai
 Often DNA damage can result in the presence of free-radical genetic material as well as other symptoms that induce enzymes and pathways responsible for activation of knot-suppressing genes
 aise jeenon kaa kaary he DNA kii marammat ke liye koshika chakra ke aage badhane par niyantran, jo utparivartan ko putree koshika tak sthanantarit hone se roktaa he
 The p53 protein, one of the most studied knot suppressor genes, is a transcription factor that is activated by several cellular stressors, including hypoxia and ultraviolet radiation damage
 p53 roopantaran main shaamil sabhi canceron ke lagbhag aadhe ke alaava, iske gaanth ke shaman kaary ko bhalee prakaar se samajha nahin gaya he
 Apparently p53 has two functions: one a nuclear role as a transcription factor and the other a cytoplasmic role in regulating cell cycle, cell division and apoptosis
 warburg pariklpana ke anusaar cancer kii vruddhi ke liye urja hetu glycolysis kaa adhimaanya prayog hota he
 p53 regulates the transfer of the glycolytic tract from respiration
 haalanki, ek utparivartan, khud "ise band karte hue" gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ko yaa is sanket maarg ko kshati pahunchaa saktaa he, jo ise sakriy karata he, is kaa achal parinaam he ki DNA kii marammat baadhit yaa sandamit ho jaati he: marammat rahit diene kshati kaa sangrah nishchit rup cancer kaa kaaran banataa he
 Mutations of the genes that suppress the knot that occur in the germ level cells are transferred to the progeny and increase the likelihood of cancer in subsequent generations
 in pariwaron ke sadasyon ne aisi ghatnaon main vruddhi kii he or isse bahul tumor kii vilambtaa main kami ai he
 The type of knot is typical for each type of mutation that suppresses the knot, with some mutations causing specific types of cancer, while other mutations causing other types of cancer
 utparivarti tumor shaamak kii vanshagati kaa prakaar yah he ki ek prabhavi sadsy ek doshapurn pratilipi ko ek janak se or saamaanya pratilipi ko duusare janak se praapt karata he
 For example, a person who inherits a mutant p53 allele may develop melanoma and pancreatic cancer called li-fraumeni syndrome
 anya vanshaagat gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin syndrome main shaamil he retino blostoma se sambandhit Rb utparivartan or adinopoliposis badi aant ke cancer se jude APC jin utparivartan
adinopoliposis badi aant kaa cancer bachapan kii avasthaa main badi aant main hajaaron polip se sambandhit hai, jo apekshaakrit kam umr main badi aant kaa cancer utpann karte hai
 Finally, hereditary mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 cause early onset of breast cancer
 1971 main yah prastaav diya gaya ki cancer kaa vikaas kam se kam do utparivartan ghatnaon par nirbhar karata he
 According to Knudson's two-injury hypothesis, a hereditary gene level mutation in a gene that is quenching a gene will cause cancer only if another mutation occurs later in the organism's life, it is the gene that suppresses that knot
 Will inactivate other alleles
 aamtaur par, onkosin prabhavi hote hai, kyonki unamem kriya-kaa-laabh utparivartan shaamil hota he, jabaki utparivartit tumor shaamak aprabhavi hote hai, kyonki unamem kriya-kii-haani utparivartan shaamil hota he
 Each cell has two copies of the same gene, each of which is obtained from the parent and in most cases an action-to-gain mutation in only one copy of a particular proto-oncogene, making that gene a true oncogene
 Is sufficient for duusari ore, kriya-kii-haani utparivartan kaa, gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin kii donon pratilipiyon main hona aavashyak he taaki jin ko puri tarah se kriyaaheen banaaya ja sake
 However, there are cases in which a mutated copy of the knot-suppressing gene neutralizes the other wild-type copy
 yah ghatana prabhavi nakaaratmak prabhaav kehalaati he or kai p53 utparivartanon main dekhi jaati he
 Knudson's two-injury model has recently been challenged by several investigators
 gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale kuch jeenon ke ek elil kaa niskriyakaran tumor ko utpann karne ke liye paryaapt he
 This phenomenon is called haploid insufficiency and has been demonstrated by several experimental approaches
 agunit aparyaaptta se utpann hui gaanth kii shuruyaat aam taur par der se hoti he, jab isaki tulana ek ek do chot kii prakriya se kii jaati he
 Often, multiple genetic changes that result in cancer may take several years to accumulate
 is samay ke dauraan, purv durdam koshikaon kaa jaivik vyavhaar dhire dhire saamaanya koshika se badal kar cancer koshika kaa ho jaataa he
 With the help of microscope, differentiating properties can be seen in pre-treated tissue
 vibhedak lakshanon main he vibhajit hoti hui koshikaon kii badi hui sankhya, kendrak ke aakaar or akruti main bhinnata, koshika ke aakaar or akruti main bhinnata, vishishtikrut koshikaon ke gunon main kami or saamaanya utak sanghathan kii kshati
 durvikasita atirikt koshika prachurod bhawan kaa ek asaamaanya prakaar he jo saamaanya utak vyavastha tathaa purv durdam koshikaon main koshika saranchana kii haani ke dwaara parilakshith hota he
 These initial tumor changes should be differentiated from overgrowth, which is a mutant increase in cell division due to an external stimulation, such as a hormonal imbalance or chronic irritation
 durvikasita ke sabase gambhir maamalon ko "swasthani karcarbud " kaha jaataa he
 In Latin, the word "in situ" means "in place", so the term carcinoma is in situ, the uncontrolled growth of cells that remain in their original place and have not shown any invasion of other tissues
 phir bhi, carcinoma swasthani ek aakraamak durdamata main viksit ho saktaa he or yadi sambhav ho to ise aam taur par shalya kriya ke dwaara hataa diya jaataa he
 Just as the growth occurs in animal populations, so does growth in uncontrolled populations of cells
 yah avaanchhneeya prakriya kayik vikaas kehalaati he or isi tarah se cancer utpann hota he or adhik durdam ban jaataa he
 Most changes in cellular metabolism that cause irregular cell division are the cause of cell death
 haalanki ek baar cancer shuru ho jane par, cancer kii koshikaayen prakritik varan kii ek prakriya se hokar guzarati hai: nae anuvanshik parivartanon se yukt kuch koshikaayen jo apane jivan or prajnan ko badhaava dene ke liye nirantar bahugunit hoti rahati hai or jaldi hi viksit hoti hui gaanth par prabhavi ho jaati hai, kyonki kam anukulit anuvanshik parivartanon se yukt koshikaayen pratispardhaa se baahar hoti hai
 Similarly, pathogens such as MRSA become antibiotic-resistant and this is why crop blight and pests become resistant to pesticides
 isi vikaas ke kaaran cancer punrariti main aisi koshikaayen hoti hai jo cancer kii dawaaon ke liye pratirodh praapt kar leti hai In a 2000 article by Hannahan and Weinberg, the biological properties of the sore knot cells were summarized as follows: in bahul padon kaa puraa hona nimna ke bina ek bahut hi durlabh ghatana hogi: These biological changes are predominant in carcinoma; Other hard knots may not be all that is needed to achieve them
 udhaaharan ke liye, utak akraman or dur ke sthanon par visthaapan shwet rakt koshikaon kaa saamaanya gun he; ye pad shwetarktata ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak nahin hai
 Different positions do not necessarily represent individual mutations
 For example, inactivation of a genus will cause codons for the p53 protein, genomic instability, apoptosis, and increased angiogenesis
 cancer kii sabhi koshikaayen vibhajit nahin hoti hai
 Rather, a sub-set of cells in a knot is called the cancerous stem cells, which replicate on their own and form differentiated cells
 cancer kii rokthaam ko, cancer kii ghatnaon main kami laane ke liye sakriy upayon ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 For this, avoiding cancer or altering their metabolism, adopting a lifestyle or diet that modifies cancer-causing factors and / or medical intervention may be useful
 "rokthaam" kii mahamari vigyaan avadharana ko saamanyatya yaa to un logon ke liye praathmik rokthaam ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he jinamein kisi vishesh rog kaa nidaan nahin kiya gaya he, yaa dwitiyak rokthaam ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, jo pehle se nidaan kiye gaye rog kii jatiltaaon ko kam karata he
 Most of the cancer risk factors are related to the environment or lifestyle in nature, claiming that cancer is a widely preventable disease
 sanshodhit kiye jane yogya cancer ke jokhim karkon ke udhaaharan hai alcohol kaa upbhog,, dhumrapan, shaareerik niskriyata or bahut adhik vajan / motopa hona 
 Based on epidemiological evidence, it is now believed that avoiding excessive alcohol consumption contributes to reducing the risk of particular types of cancers; However, in comparison to tobacco, the amount of effect is much lower and the evidence potential is often weaker

 cancer kaa upachaar shalya chikitsa, rasochikitsa, vikiran chikitsa, pratiraksha chikitsa, monochlonal antibody chikitsa yaa anya vidhiyon ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 The choice of therapy depends on the condition and range of the knot and the stage of the disease, as well as the general state of the patient
 Many experimental cancer treatments are also being developed
 sharir ko nuksaan pahuchaye bina cancer ko puri tarah se khatm karnaa upachaar kaa uddeshy hota he
 Sometimes this can be done surgically, but the tendency of the cancer to invade nearby tissue or spread to distant locations by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness
 chemotherapy kii prabhaavashiltaa aksar sharir main anya utakon ke vishikaran ke dwaara simit ho jaati he
 Radiation can also damage normal tissues
 kyonki "cancer" kaa sandarbh rogon ke ek varg se he, aisa sambhav nahin he ki "cancer kaa hameshaa ek maatr upachaar" hi rahegaa, phir bhi sabhi sankramak rogon ke liye ek hi upachaar hota he
 Theoretically, non-hematological cancer can be treated if it is completely removed by surgery, but this is not always possible
 jab cancer shalya chikitsa se pehle hi metastasis ke dwaara sharir ke anya angon tak pahunch jaataa he, tab puri tarah se shalya kriya dwaara ise hataa dena aam taur par asambhav hota he
 In the halted sample of cancer progression, the knot grows spatially, then spreads to the lymph nodes, and then to all other parts of the body
 For this reason, the popularity of endemic treatments such as surgery for small cancers has increased
 yahan tak ki chote sthaniyakrut tumor main bhi metastasis kii bahut adhik kshamta hoti he
 Examples of surgical procedures for cancer include - breast amputation for breast cancer and prostate-piercing for prostate cancer
 The goal of surgery is to either remove the knot or remove the entire organ
 a cancer cell is invisible to the naked eye, but can then grow into a new knot, a process known as recurrence
 is kaaran ke liye, rogavigyaani shalya kriya se nikaale gaye namoonay kii jaanch karte hai, yadi swasth utak kii seemaa upasthit he, to is baat kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he ki sookshm cancer kii koshikayen rogi ke sharir main rah gai hai
 In addition to the removal of the primary knot, surgery is often required for stage determination eg determining the extent of the disease and determining whether it has reached the regional lymph nodes via metastasis
 avasthaa nirdhaaran purv nidaan kaa mukhya nirdharak he or sahyogi chikitsa kii aavashyaktaa bhi he
 Often, surgery is necessary to control symptoms such as spinal cord compression or bowel obstruction
 ise shaman upachaar ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation to destroy cancer cells and compressed lumps
 vikiran chikitsa ko bahya kiran radiotherapy ke dwaara baahar se hi niyantrit kiya jaataa he yaa brekitherapy ke dwaara andar se niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 The effect of radiation therapy is localized and limited to the area to be treated
 vikiran chikitsa, ilaaj kiye jane vaale kshetra kii koshikaon ko kshatigrast karti he yaa nasht kar detii he, is kriya main in koshikaon ke anuvanshik padaarth ko nasht kar diya jaataa he taaki koshikaon main aage vibhaajan or vruddhi na ho paae
yadhyapi vikiran cancer kii koshikaon or saamaanya koshikaon donon ko nasht kar dete hai, adhikansh saamaanya koshikaayen vikiran ke prabhaav se ubar aati hai or thik prakaar se kaary karne lagati hai
 The goal of radiation therapy is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting damage to nearby healthy tissue
 isliye, yah kai bhaagon main di jaati he jisase bich kii avadhi main swasth utakon ko thik hone kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 Radiation therapy can be used to treat almost every type of solid lump, including cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, abdomen, uterus, or soft tissue sarcoma
 
 leukemia or limphoma ke upachaar main bhi vikiran chikitsa kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The radiation dose for each site depends on many factors, these factors are, the radio sensitivity of each type of cancer and whether the surrounding tissue or organs can be destroyed by radiation
 is prakaar, har prakaar ke upachaar main, vikiran chikitsa iske parshv dushprabhavon ke bina nahin he
 Cancer treatment of cancer is done in medicines which can destroy cancer cells
 vartmaan upyog main, shabd "rasochikitsa" kaa upyog un cytotoxic yaa koshikavishi dawaaon ke liye kiya jaataa he jo lakshith chikitsa ke vipareet, saamaanya rup main tezi se vibhajit hoti hui koshikaon ko prabhavit karti hai
 
 Rheumatic drugs inhibit cell division in various possible ways, for example by replication of DNA or segregation of newly formed chromosomes
 Most forms of chemotherapy target all cells that rapidly divide, specific only to cancer cells
 Are not, although some specificity is due to the fact that most cancer cells are not capable of repairing DNA damage
 Whereas normal cells typically have these abilities
 atah, rasochikitsa main swasth utakon ko nuksaan pahunchane kii kshamta hoti he, vishesh rup se ve utak jinamein ucch pratisthaapan dar hoti he 
ye koshikaayen aamtaur par rasochikitsa ke baad apni marammat kar leti hai
 Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are given at the same time
 ise "sangyojan rasochikitsa" kaha jaataa he; adhikansh rasochikitsa regimen ek sangyojan main hi die jate hai
 Treatment of some types of leukemia and lymphoma requires high doses of chemotherapy or whole body decompression
 yah upachaar asthi majja ko alag kar detaa he or isliye sharir kii thik hone or rakt ke punarniman kii kshamta pruthakkrut ho jaati he
 For this reason, bone marrow, or peripheral blood column cell harvesting is performed before the ablation effect of therapy so that "rescue" is possible after treatment
 ise autologus stem koshika pratyaropan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Alternatively, hematopoietic stem cells taken from a matched unrelated donor can be transplanted
 lakshith therapy jo 1990 ke dashak ke ant main sabase pehle uplabdh hui, kaa kai prakaar ke cancer ke upachaar main mukhya prabhaav tha or vartmaan main yah ek bahut hi adhik sakriy anusandhan kshetra he
 This includes the use of factors that are specialized to unregulate the proteins of cancer cells
 chote anu lakshith upachaar dawaayein aamtaur par cancer koshikaon ke bheetar utparivartit, ati abhivyakt, yaa anya jatil proteinon par anzymetic domen kii sandamak hoti hai
 Major examples are the thyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib and zefitinib
 monochlonal pratirakshi chikitsa ek anya ranneeti he jisamen upachaar kaa kaarak ek pratirakshi hota he jo cancer koshikaon kii sataha par ek protein ke saath vishesh rup se bandha bana letaa he
 Examples include anti-her2 / neu antibody trastuzumeb used in breast cancer and anti-cd-20 antibody rituximeb used in many types of B-cell malignancies
 lakshith therapy main "homing yukti" ke rup main chote peptid bhi shaamil ho sakate hai, jo gaanth ke chaaron ore prabhavit bahya koshiki matrix ke saath yaa koshika kii sataha par grahi ke saath baandh bana sakate hai
 Radio nuclides that are attached to these peptides eventually kill the cancer cell if the nucleus is decomposing around the cell
 vishesh rup se in bandhit padaarthon ke oligo- yaa multimers bahut mahatvapurn hote hai, chunki ve gaanth kii vishistataa or uthkanthaa ko badhaate hai
 Photodynamic therapy is a triple treatment for cancer that includes photosensitizers, tissue oxygen, and light
 PDT kaa upyog aadhari koshika carcinoma yaa fefdon ke cancer ke upachaar ke liye kiya jaataa he; PDT bade tumor ko shalya chikitsa ke dwaara hataa die jane ke baad durdam utak ke bache hue avasheshon ko hataane main bhi upyogi ho saktaa he
 Cancer immune therapy is a group of different medical strategies designed to induce a patient's own immune system to fight the knot
 gaanth ke khilaaf pratirakshi pratikriya utpann karne ke liye kai vidhiyaan hai, ye hai, satahi mutrashi cancer ke liye antar dhaneey BCG pratiraksha chikitsa, tathaa vrikk koshika carcinoma or melanoma ke rogiyon main pratirakshi pratikriya prerit karne ke liye interferon or anya cytokine kaa upyog
 kai prakaar kii ganthon, khaas taur par durdam melanoma or vrikk koshika carcinoma, ke liye vishisht pratiraksha pratikriya utpann karne ke liye vexinon par gahan anusandhan kiya ja rahaa he
 cephalucal-t is a vaccine-like strategy used in modern clinical trials for prostate cancer, in which thrushmash cells taken from the patient are loaded with prostatic acid phosphatase peptides to induce a specific immune response against prostate-derived cells
 To be
 elloginenic hemetopoctic stem koshika pratyaropan ko pratiraksha therapy kaa ek rup mana ja saktaa he, kyonki daata kii pratiraksha koshikaayen grapht-banaam-gaanth prabhaav ke tahat gaanth par aksar akraman karti hai
 Therefore, allogeneic HSCT causes higher rates of treatment than autologous transplants for many types of cancer, although side effects are also more severe
 kuch cancer kii vruddhi ko vishesh hormonon ko uplabdh kara kar yaa avaruddh karke sandamit kiya ja saktaa he
 Some common examples of hormone sensory lumps are - specific types of breast and prostate cancer
 Removing or blocking estrogen or testosterone is often an important additional treatment
 vishesh prakaar ke canceron main, hormone kaa prashasan shithil ho jaataa he, jaise projestogen chikitsa kii drushti se laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 Angiogenesis that is required for the tumor to survive
 kuch, jaise bevasizumeb, ko manyata de di gayi he or chikitsakeey upyog main inkaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 a main problem with anti-angiogenesis drugs is that many factors stimulate the growth of blood vessels in normal and cancerous cells
 angiogenesis virdohi dawaaye keval ek hi kaarak ko lakshya banaati hai, isliye anya kaarak rakt vahini kii vruddhi ko uttejit karnaa jari rakhte hai
 Other problems include route of administration, maintenance of stability and action and targeting on tumor vasculature
 yadhyapi cancer ke lakshanon par niyantran ko cancer kaa upachaar nahin mana ja saktaa he, yah cancer rogiyon kii jivan kii gunvattta kaa ek mahatvapurn nirdharak he or is faisle main mukhya bhoomika nibhaataa he ki rogi anya upachaar ke liye sakasham he yaa nahin
 Although doctors have the therapeutic skills to reduce pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, and other common problems in cancer patients, this group of patients responds to the needs of symptom control in a multi-disciplinary manner of palliative care
 Specialty has evolved
 dard kii dawaaye, jaise ki morphine or oxicodon or michali or ulti ko rokane ke liye antiemetics dawaaen, cancer se sambandhit lakshanon se yukt rogiyon main aam taur par kaam main lee jaati hai
 Sophisticated antiemetics such as ondansetron and analogues, as well as aprapitant, have made radical treatment more likely in cancer patients
 cancer ke kaaran purana dard hameshaa satat utak kshati ke kaaran hota he jo rog yaa upachaar prakriya se sambandhit he yadhyapi paryaavarniya karkon or dard ke vyavhaar ke utpaadan main prabhavi gadbadi kii bhi bhoomika hoti he, cancer ke dard se yukt rogiyon main aam taur par pramukh ityologic kaaran nahin hote hai
 Furthermore, most patients with severe cancer-related pain are in the late stages of their lives and need palliative therapy
 mudde jaise nashile padaarthon ke upyog kaa saamaajik kalank, kaam or kaaryaatmak sthiti or swasthya dekhbhaal, samgr maamle ke prabandhan main adhik mahatvapurn nahin hai
 Therefore, the specific strategy for cancer pain management is to try to get maximum comfort to the patient by the use of narcotics and other drugs, surgical and physical methods
 doctor cancer ke antim sthiti ke rogiyon main dard ke liye maadak padaarthon kaa upyog nahin karnaa chaahate hai kyon ki isse unhen isaki lat ho sakati he yaa unki shwaas kriya main baadha aa sakati he
 Palliative care is a new branch of the care movement that provides more comprehensive support in the treatment of pain in cancer patients
 thakaan cancer rogiyon ke liye ek bahut hi aam samasya he or haal hi main cancer chikitsa vigyaniyon ke liye iskaa upachaar bahut mahatvapurn ban gaya he, yadhyapi yah kai rogiyon main jivan kii gunvattta ko lekar mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Clinical trials, also called research studies, also test new treatments in cancer patients
 is shodh kaa lakshya he cancer ke ilaaj ke liye behatar tareeke khojna or cancer rogiyon kii madad karnaa
 Clinical trials test a range of therapies such as new drugs, new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy, new combinations of treatments, or new methods such as gene therapy
 ek naidanik pareekshan, ek lambi or satark cancer anusandhan kii prakriya ke antim charnon main se ek he
 The search for new treatments begins in the laboratory, where scientists first test and develop new ideas
 agar ek drushtikon upyogi prathit hota he to aglaa kadam hota he iskaa jaanavar par pareekshan, jo yah bataata he ki cancer rogi par iskaa kya prabhaav hoga or iske koi hanikaarak prabhaav hai yaa nahin
 Of course, many treatments that work well in the laboratory or in animals do not always prove effective in humans
 upyogi maane jane vaale upachaar surakshit or prabhavi hai yaa nahin, iskaa pataa lagane ke liye cancer ke rogiyon main adhyayan kiye jate hai
 It may be that the patient participating in this treatment will personally get help from this treatment
 ve cancer visheshgyon se aadhuniktam suraksha praapt karte hai or ve yaa to jaanch kiya ja rahaa nayaa ilaaj praapt karte hai yaa cancer ke liye sarvottam uplabdh maanak upachaar praapt karte hai
 Also, new treatments may carry unknown risks, but if new treatments prove effective or more effective than standard treatments, the patient studied becomes the first person to receive its benefit
 is baat kii koi guarantee nahin he ki pareekshan kiya jane vaala nayaa upachaar yaa ek maanak upachaar achche parinaam degaa
 In children with cancer, a survey showed that children who underwent such testing did not, on average, see better or worse outcomes than standard treatments; This ensures that the success or failure of any experimental treatment cannot be predicted
 poorak or vaikalpik chikitsa upachaar, chikitsa, swasthya raksha pranaaliyon, prathaon or utpaadon ke vividh samooh hai, jo parmparik chikitsa ke bhaag nahin hai
 "complementary medicine" refers to the methods and substances used in conjunction with traditional medicine
 jabaki "vaikalpik chikitsa" kaa arth un yogicon se he jinka upyog parmparik chikitsa ke sthaan par kiya jaataa he
 The use of CAM is common in people with cancer; a study conducted in 2000 found that 69% of cancer patients used at least one CAM therapy as part of their cancer treatment
 cancer ke liye zyaadaatar poorak or vaikalpik chikitsaaon kaa kathor adhyayan yaa pareekshan nahin kiya gaya he
 Some alternative treatments, which have been investigated and are ineffective, are being marketed and encouraged
 garbhvatee maataaon kii badhati hui umr ke kaaran garbhavastha ke dauraan samavarti cancer kii ghatnaon main vruddhi hui he, in ghatnaon main vruddhi kaa ek or kaaran he janm purv ultrasound pareekshanon ke dauraan praasangik rup se mata main gaanth kii jaanch
 Cancer treatment needs to be selected for the least harm to both the mother and her fetus / child

 There are usually no questions on radiation therapy, and there is always a risk of miscarriage and congenital malformations in chemotherapy
 bachche par chikitsa ke prabhaavon ke bare main bahut kam gyaat he
 Even a drug that has been tested that it does not reach the baby through the placenta, some forms of cancer can damage the placenta and the drug goes through it
 twachaa cancer ke kuch rup metastasis ke dwaara bachche ke sharir main bhi pravesh kar sakate hai
 Diagnosis has also become more difficult, since computed tomography is infeasible because of its high radiation dose
 phir bhi, chumbakeey anunaad imaging saamaanya rup se kaam karata he
 However the opposite media cannot be used, as they cross the placenta
 garbhavastha ke dauraan cancer ke thik prakaar se nidaan or upachaar main aane vaali kathinaaiyon ke ek parinaam ke rup main, vaikalpik tareekon kaa istamaal kiya jaataa he, isamen yaa to adhik ugr cancer upachaar shuru karne ke liye ek sijerian section kaa upyog kiya jaataa he yaa yadi cancer itnaa adhik durdam ho chukaa he ki maa ke ilaaj main or deree nahin kii ja sakati he to cancer kaa upachaar karne ke liye garbhpaat kar diya jaataa he
 Sometimes, the fetal nodes are diagnosed while staying in the uterus
 terratoma bhrun tumor kaa sabase aam prakaar he or aamtaur par saumy hota he

 haalanki yah baat nishchit rup se vishesh prakaaron par hi lagu hoti he, cancer ke aitihaasik tathyon ke peeche chuphi hui sachai chikitsa kshetra main aadhunikeekaran ke kaaran badal gai he
 Some types of cancer have been found to have symptoms that are better than some other diseases such as heart failure and heart attack
 pragatisheel or teji se failte hue durdam rog kaa cancer rogi ke jivan kii gunvattta par kaaphi prabhaav padataa he or kai cancer upachaar ke gambhir parshv dushprabhav ho sakate hai
