 Regular vaccination of adults is neither necessary nor recommended in developed countries as most adults are either already immunized or have a very low risk of exposure to the wild polio virus
 2002 main, ek ipivi yukt pentavalent sangyojan vaxin ko sanyukt rajya america main upyog ke liye manjuuri de di gayi 
 us vaxin main tetanus, dipthiria, kaali khaansee ke saath hi hepatitis bi ke tike kii ek bal chikitsa khuraaq bhi shaamil thi

 In 1958, the National Institutes of Health formed a special committee on live polio vaccines
 Various vaccines were carefully evaluated to be able to induce immunity to polio, as well as how low they could maintain the frequency of neuropathogenicity in monkeys
 in parinaamon ke aadhaar par, sabin upabhedon ko duniya bhar main vitaran ke liye chunaa gaya 
 In 1961, type 1 and 2 monovalent oral poliovirus vaccines were licensed, and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed

 The live virus used in the vaccine is released through feces and thus can spread to the community, resulting in protection against polio for individuals who have not been directly vaccinated

 There was no unhappiness or helplessness in the rule of the entire Khandava kingdom, Ballabh Garh and the king of Agar district
 bachapan se hi ve apni praja main bahut lokapriy the
 He was a religious, peace messenger, praja vatsal, anti-violence, abolition of Bali system, Karunanidhi, loving kindness to all beings, loving kindness king
 ye ballab garh or agra ke raja ballab ke jyeshtha putr, shurasen ke bade bhai the At the time of puberty, he was invited to join the swayamvara of Raja Nagraj's daughter princess Madhavi
 us swayamvar main dur-dur se anek raja or rajkumaar aae the
 Even Indra, the king of the gods, came to visit the princess's beauty
 swayamvar main rajkumaari madhavi ne rajkumaar agrasen ke gale main jayamala daal di
 It was a combination of two different sects, castes and cultures
 jahaan agrasen suryavanshi the vahiin madhavi nagvansha kii kanya thim
 Indra got jealous of anger and anger due to this marriage and he stopped rain in Pratapnagar
 chaaron ore traahi-traahi much gayi
 People started becoming grasps of premature death
 tab maharaj agrasen ne indra ke viruddh yuddh chhed diya
 As Agrasen was fighting a religious war, his palace was heavy, seeing that the Gods made Narada Rishi a mediator and got the reconciliation between the two
 kuch samay baad maharaj agrasen ne apane praja-janon kii khushhaali ke liye kaashi nagari ja shivaji kii ghor tapasya kii, jisase bhagwaan shiv ne prasann ho unhen maan lakshmi kii tapasya karne kii salaah di
 Mother Lakshmi was pleased with the austerity done for charity and gave her darshan and said that she should create a new state and follow the Kshatra Dharma, nurture and protect her state and subjects! His kingdom will always be full of wealth
 apane naye rajya kii sthapana ke liye maharaj agrasen ne apni rani madhavi ke saath saare bharatvarsh kaa bhraman kiya
 At the same time, a lioness was seen giving birth to a cub at one place, it is said that soon after taking birth, the cub immediately jumped on the elephant considering Maharaja Agrasen's elephant as a crisis for his mother
 unhen laga ki yah divine sandesh he jo is veerbhumi par unhen rajya sthapit karne kaa sanket de rahaa he
 On the advice of sages and astrologers, the new state was named Agriyagna or Agrodaya and the place where the cub was born, Agroha, the capital of Agrodaya, was established
 yah jagah aaj ke haryana ke hisar ke paas hai
 Even today, this place is worshiped as the fifth dham for the Agrawal community, at present the Agroha Development Trust has made facilities for the people of Agrawal community who come here by building very beautiful temples, Dharamshalas etc
 maharaja agrasen ko samaajwaad kaa agradoot kaha jaataa he
 In order to establish true socialism in his area, he made a rule that in order to help every family who settled in his city from outside, each family in the city would give him a coin of the current trend and a brick, so that the newcomer could easily live for himself
 Manage the location and business
 maharaja agrasen ne tantreey shashan pranali ke pratikaar main ek nayi vyavastha ko janm diya, unhone punah vaidic sanathan arya saskrunti kii mul manyataon ko lagu kar rajya kii punargathan main krishi-vyapaar, udyog, goupalan ke vikaas ke saath-saath naitik mulyon kii punah pratishtha kaa bidaa uthaaya
 In this way, during the reign of Maharaja Agrasen, the Agrodaya Republic made double progress day and night
 kehete hai ki isaki charam smriddhi ke samay vahaan lakhon vyapaaree rahaa karte the
 To the newcomer who came there, the family settled in the state used to give one rupee and a brick as help, thus the newcomer would get millions of rupees and bricks to establish himself so that he could start his business without worry

 maharishi garg ne maharaja agrasen ko 18 ganadhipatiyon ke saath 18 yajna karne kaa sankalp karavaaya
 Seventeen-and-a-half gotras of the Agrawans were established in the name of these 18 Ganadhipatis sitting in yagyas
 us samay yagyon main pashubali anivaary rup se di jaati thi
 The priests of the first yajna themselves became Garg sages, initiated the eldest prince Vibhu and chanted them from the Garga gotra
 isi prakaar doosraa yajna gobhil rishi ne karavaaya or dwitiya ganadhipati ko goyal gotra diya
 Third Yagya Gautam Rishi got Goin gotra, in fourth Vatshi got Bansal gotra, in fifth Kaushik Rishi got kansal gotra, in sixth Shandilya Rishi was Singhal gotra, in seventh seventh Mangal Rishi got Mangal gotra, in eighth Jamin got Jindal gotra Tandya Rishi had Tingal gotra, Tenth in Aurvish Rishi, Aryan gotra in Gyarave, Dhaumya Rishi in Gyarawan got Dharan gotra, Mudgal Rishi in twelfth got Mandal gotra, Vasantha Rishi in thirteenth l'gotra, in the fourteenth, Maitreya Rishi gave the Mittal gotra, the fifteenth Kashyap Rishi gave the Kuchal gotra
 17 yajna purna ho chuke the
 At the time when live animals were being sacrificed in the 18th Yajna, Maharaj Agrasen was disgusted by seeing that scene
 unhone yajna ko bich main hi roak diya or kaha ki bhavishya main mere rajya kaa koi bhi vyakti yajna main pashubali nahin degaa, na pashu ko maaregaa, na maans khayega or rajya kaa har vyakti pranimaatr kii raksha karegaa
 Impressed by this incident, he embraced non-violence religion
 idhar antim or athaharwe yajna main yagnacharyo dwaara pashubali ko anivaary bataaya gaya, naa hone par gotra adhuraa rah jayega, aisa kaha gaya, parantu maharaja agrasen ke aadesh par atharaven yajna main nagendra rishi dwaara nangal gotra se abhimantrit kiya
 This gotra is considered half due to lack of animal sacrifices, thus even today 18 and a half seventeen gotras are prevalent in Agarwal society

 agarawalon ke 18 gotra nimnlikhit hai - Yagna was considered a sign of prosperity, splendor and prosperity at that time
 maharaj agrasen ne bahut saare yajna kiye
 Once the horse brought to the sacrificial fire was very restless and frightened, he got an idea that what is the benefit of such prosperity which is filled with the blood of silent animals
 usee samay unhone apane mantriyon ke naa chaahane par bhi pashu bali par roak laga di
 That is why even today, the leading society remains away from violence
 maharaj agrasen ke raaj kii vaibhavta se unke padosi raja bahut jalte the
 So they kept attacking Agroha again and again
 baar-baar munhaki khaane ke baavjood unke kaaran rajya main tanaav bana hi rahata tha
 Due to these wars, Agrasenji was disturbed in the work of the welfare of the subjects
 log bhi bhaybheet or roj-roj kii ladai se trast ho gayi the
 Along with this, a huge fire broke out in Agroha once
 us par kisi bhi tarah kaabo naa paaya ja sakaa
 Thousands of people became homeless due to that fire and went to different states of India in search of livelihood
 par unhone apni pahchaan nahin chhodi
 All of them still like to be called Agarwal and maintain their identity with the same 18 gotras

 Towards the end of his life, Maharaj handed over all the responsibility to his eldest son Vibhu and adopted the Vanaprastha Ashram

 Hospitals, schools, stepwells, Dharamshalas etc

 Wherever he took refuge in Italy, the administration had to play eyeball with the eye
