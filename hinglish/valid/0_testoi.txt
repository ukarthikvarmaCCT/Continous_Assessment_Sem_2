 durgadas rathod bharat ke marwar kshetra ke rathod rajvansh ke ek mantri the
 He became the protector of Kunwar Ajit Singh after the death of Maharaja Jaswant Singh
 unhone mogul samraat aurangzeb ko bhi chunauti di or kai baar oranghazab ko yuddh main peeche hatane ore sandhi ke liye majaboor kiya or kai baar yuddh main haraaya
 Durgadas was the son of Asakaran Rathore, a minister of the Marwar ruler Maharaja Jaswant Singh
 unki maan apane pati or unki anya patniyon ke saath nahin raheen or jodhpur se dur raheen
 Hence Durgadas was raised in a village called Lunava
 inkaa janm salwa kalla main hua tha
 Jaswant Singh died in Afghanistan in 1678 and he had no heir declared at the time of his death
 aurangzeb ne maukey kaa phayda uthaate huye marwar main apana hastkshep jamaane kaa prayaas kiya
 This led to the formation of a Mughal strategy to destroy the Hindus and the Mughal army could not succeed even after much bloodshed
 jaswant singh ke nidhan ke baad unki do raniyon ne nar bachche ko janm diya
 One of them died only after birth and the other succeeded him as Ajit Singh
 farvari 1679 tak yah samachar aurangzaib tak pahunchaa lekin unhone bachche vaid vaaris ke rup main maanane se manaa kar diya
 He also imposed jizya tax
 ab maharaj ajitsingh kii aayu atharah varsh kii thi
 Gradually, the work of the state was understood, and he was able to carry the kingdom without the help of Durgadas
 yah dekhakar vir durgaadaraas ne sanwat 1758 vi
 main maharaj ajit ko bhaar saunp diya
 Used to give his consent when needed
 jab 1765 vi
 main aurangzeb dakshin main maaraa gaya to uskaa jyeshtha putr muajjam gaddi par baitha or apane purvaj badshaah akbar kii bhaanti apni praja kaa paalan karne laga
 There was no discrimination between Hindus and Muslims
 yah dekh durgadas ne nishcint hokar purna rup se rajyabhaar ajitsingh ko saunp diya, kintu swatantra hokar ajitsingh ke swabhaav main bahut parivartan hone laga
 Like a bursting bed, the water became free
 apane swechhachari mitron ke kehane se praja ko kabhi-kabhi nyaay viruddh baari dand de detaa tha
 Gradually the power to consider their loss and profit began to wane
 jo jaisi salaah detaa tha
 , Used to get ready to do it
 swayan kuch na dekhtaa tha
 , Used to listen with ears only
 jisane pehle kaan phunke, usee kii baat satya samajhataa tha
 Gradually the subjects also started blasphemy
 durgadas ne kai baar niti-upadesh kiya, bahut kuch samajhaayaa-bujhaayaa, parantu camel ke patto par jis prakaar jal kii boond thahar jaati he, or vaayu ke jhakore se turant hi gir jaati he, usee prakaar jo kuch ajitsingh ke hriday-patal par upadesh kaa asar hua, turant hi swaarthee mitron ne nikaal phenkaa or yahaan tak praytn kiya ki durgadas kii ore se maharaj kaa manamalinya ho gaya
 Gradually the injustice continued to increase
 vivash hokar durgadas ne apane parivaar ko udaipur bhej diya or akelaa hi jodhpur main rahakar anyaay ke parinaam kii pratiksha karne laga
 When a man could not even see the poison tree watered with his hand, it was the son of the venerable Durga Dass's revered Swami Shri Maharaj Jaswant Singh
 , uskaa naash hote vah kab dekh saktaa tha
 But what does it do? It was not his fault in front of selfish friends, so he decided to go out of Jodhpur
 avasar paakar ek din maharaj se vidaa lene ke liye darbar ja rahaa tha
 On the way, an old man was found, who was a well-wisher of Durgadas
 kehane laga bhai durgadas! acha hota, yadi aap aaj raaj-darbar na jate; kyonki aaj darbar jane main aapaki kushal nahin
 As far as i have come to know, Maharaj has secretly given permission to kill you with the advice of his selfish friends
 durgadas ne kaha – ‘ bhai! ab main vruddh hua, mujhe maranaa to he hi phir kshatriya hokar mrityu se kyon darun? rajputi main kalank lagaaun; maut se darkar peeche laut jaaun! is prakaar kahata hua nirbhay singh ke samaan darbar main pahunchaa or haath jodakar maharaj se tirthayatr ke liye vidaa maangi
 Maharaj said with an upper mind - 'chachaji! Your separation will be very sad for us; But now you are old, and the question is of pilgrimage; That is why it is not done either
 acha to jaaie, parantu jahaan tak sambhav ho sheeghra hi laut aaie
 Durgadas said - 'just as the Maharaja commanded and walked; But returned to the door
 maharaj ne poocha chachaa ji, kyon? durgadas ne kaha – ‘ maharaj, ab aaj na jaaoongaa; mujhe abhi yaad aayaa ki maharaj yashawantisingh ji mujhe ek gupt kosh kii chaabi de gayi the, parantu abhi tak main na to aapako gupt khajaana hi bataa sakaa or na chaabi hi de sakaa; isliye vah bhi aapako saunp duun, tab jaaun? kyonki ab main bahut vruddh ho gaya hum, na-jane kab or kahaan mar jaaun? tab to yah aseem dhan-raashi sab mitti main mil jaayegi
 On hearing this, the greed suppressed Ajitsingh
 sansar main aisa koun he, jise lobh ne na gheraa ho? kisne lobh devtaa kii ajna kaa ulanghan kiya he? sochane laga; yadi mere aagyaanusaar durgadas kahin maaraa gaya,to yah sampatti apane haath na aa sakegi
 Will there be no more opportunities? Will be seen again yah vichaar kar apane mitron ko sanket kiya
 Realizing this, one went ahead and removed the appointed man from there
 is prakaar dhokhe se dhan kaa laalach dekar chatur durgadas ne apane praanon kii raksha kii
 Came home, took arms, rode a horse and sent Maharaj saying that Durgadas did not want to die the death of dogs
 ran-kshetra main jis vir kii himmat ho aaye
 Ajitsingh trembled upon hearing this message
 bolaa durgadas jahaan janaa chaahe, jane do

 The English language is written in Roman script
 yah ek pashchim jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-sexn england main hui thi
 As a result of the military, scientific, political, economic, and cultural influences of the United States in the first half of the 19th century and the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries of the British Empire, it has become a common language in many parts of the world
 kai antarrashtriya sanghathanon or rashtramandal deshon main bade paimaane par iskaa istemaal ek dwitiya bhashaa or adhikarik bhashaa ke rup main hota he
 Historically, the English language has its origins in several dialects, now called Old English, introduced by the anglo-saxon people who settled in England since the early 5th century
 viking hamalaavaron kii pracheen norse bhashaa kaa angreji bhashaa par gaharaa prabhaav padaa he

 vahaan se aadhunik angreji kaa vikaas hua or abhi bhi isamen anek bhashaaon se videshi shabdon ko apnaane or saath hi saath nae shabdon ko gadhane kii prakriya nirantar jari he
 The formation of a large number of English words, especially technical words, is based on the roots of ancient Greek and Latin
 aadhunik angreji, jisko kabhi - kabhi pratham vaishvik saamaanya bhashaa ke taur par bhi varnit kiya jaataa he,sanchaar, vigyaan, vyapaar, vimaanan, manoranjan, radio or kootneeti ke kshetron kii pramukh antarrashtriya bhashaa he
 Its expansion beyond the British Isles began with the development of the British Empire and by the end of the 19th century its reach had become truly global
 yah sanyukt rajya america kii pramukh bhashaa he
 Since the Second World War, the recognition of America as a global superpower and its increasing economic and cultural influence has brought significant momentum in the spread of the English language

 According to linguists such as David Crystal, an effect of the widespread spread of English, as has happened with other global languages, appears to reduce the diversity of vernacular languages in many parts of the world, particularly The effect is seen in Australasia and North America, and its enormous impact continues to play an important role in language attrition
 isi prakaar aitihaasi bhashavid, jo kii bhashaa parivartan kii jatilta or gatishiltaa se avgat hai, angreji bhashaa dwaara alag bhashaaon ke ek nae parivaar kaa nirmaan karne kii isaki aseem sambhaavnaaon ke prati hameshaa avgat rahete hai
 According to these linguists, the reason for this is the huge size of the English language and the spread of communities using it and its natural internal diversity, such as its creoles and pizzins 
o english ek west jarmenic bhashaa he jisaki utpatti anglo-fritian or loar sexn boliyon se hui he
 These dialects were brought to Britain in the 5th century by German nomads and Roman auxiliary armies from various parts of present-day northwestern Germany and northern Netherlands
 in jarmenic janajatiyon main se ek thi engles, jo sambhawatah angton se aaye the

 Anglo Saxons began invading Denmark and Jutland in 449 AD, before their arrival the locals of England spoke Brythonic, a Celtic language
 haalaanki boli main sarvaadhik mahatvapurn parivartan 1066 ke norman akraman ke pashchaat hi aaye, parantu bhashaa ne apane naam ko banaaye rakhaa or norman akraman purv kii boli ko ab puraani angreji kaha jaataa he
 Initially Old English was a group of diverse dialects that reflected the diversity of the anglo-saxon states of Great Britain
 inamen se ek boli, let west sexn, antat apana varchasv sthapit karne main safal hui
 mul puraani angrezi bhashaa phir akraman kii do laharon se prabhavit hui
 pehla jarmenic parivaar ke uttari jarmenic shakha ke bhashaa bolne waalon dwaara tha; unhone 8 veen or 9 veen sadi main british dwipon ke kuch hisson ko jitkar upnivesh bana diya
 doosraa 11 veen sadi ke normans the, jo kii puraani norman bhashaa bolte the or isaki anglo-norman namak ek angreji kism kaa vikaas kiya
 The English became somewhat "mixed" due to these two attacks
 scandinaviens ke saath sahanivaas ke parinamswaroop angreji bhashaa ke anglo-frisian kor kaa shabdic anupuran hua; baad ke norman kabje ke parinamswaroop bhashaa ke germanik kor kaa sundarikaran hua, isamen romance bhashaaon se kai sundar shabdon ko samavisht kiya gaya
 This Norman influence entered English mainly through the courts and the government
 is prakaar, angreji ek "udhaar" kii bhashaa ke rup main viksit hui jisamen lacheelaapan or ek vishaal shabdaawalee thi
 The rise and expansion of the British Empire as well as the emergence of the United States as a great power resulted in the spread of English throughout the world
 paanchavin or chhathi sadi main britain ke dwipon par uttar kii ore se angel or sexn qabeelon ne hamalaa kiya tha or unhone keltic bhashaayen bolne vaale sthaneey logon ko scotland, ireland or wales kii ore dhakel diya tha
 Attacks of Vikings and Norse tribes from the north also began in the eighth and ninth centuries, and thus the region of present-day England became a country of many language speakers and many old words found new meanings
 jaise – dream kaa arth us samay tak anand lenaa tha lekin uttar ke vikings ne ise sapane kaa arth de diya
 Similarly, the word skirt also came here with the northern attackers
 lekin iskaa rup badal kar shart ho gaya
 Later both the words started to be used in different meanings and are happening till date
 san 500 se lekar 1100 tak ke kaal ko puraani angrezi kaa daur kaha jaataa he
 In 1066, the Duke of Normandy invaded England and conquered the anglo-saxon tribes here

 This period of English continued from 1100 to 1500 and this period of English expansion is called medieval English
 kaanoon or aparaadh-dand se sambandh rakhane vaale bahut se angrezi shabd isi kaal main prachlit hue
 Chaucer's poetry in English literature is said to be an important example of this language
 san 1500 ke baad angrezi kaa aadhunik kaal aarambh hota he jisamen unani bhashaa ke kuch shabdon ne milanaa aarambh kiya
 This period begins in the name of a litterateur like Shakespeare and lasts till 1800

 Spelling simplicity and simple and easy to speak style are characteristic of American English
 angreji bhashaa indo-europea bhashaa parivaar ke germanik shakha ke pashchimi up-shakha kii sadsy he
 The only surviving relatives of English have two names, either Scots, spoken mainly in Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland, or Frisian
 Since Scots linguists see either a separate language or a group of dialects of English, Frisian is often said to be the closest relative of English than Scots
 inke baad anya jarmenic bhashaaon kaa number aata he jinka naata thodaa dur kaa he, ve hai, pashchimi europea bhashaayen or uttari jarmenic bhashaayen or farois
 scots or sambhawatah frisian ke apwaad ke sivaa inamen se kisi bhi bhashaa kaa angreji ke saath parsparik mail nahin baithta he
 The reason for this is the difference in word storage, syntax, semantics and phonetic knowledge
 anya jarmenic bhashaaon ke saath angreji ke shabd bhandaran main antar kaa mukhya kaaran angreji main badi maatra main latin shabdon kaa upyog he or french ) german or angreji kaa vaakyavinyas bhi angreji se kaaphi alag he, vaakyon ko banane ke liye alag niyam hai 
 shabdaarth vigyaan angreji or uske sambandhiyon ke bich juthi dostiyon kaa kaaran he
 Differences in phonics also blur basically related words, and sometimes both phonetics and semantics are different
 1500 sau se zyada varshon se angreji main yogic shabdon ke nirmaan or maujuuda shabdon main sudhaar kii kriya apane alag andaaj main, germanik bhashaaon se pruthak, chal rahi he
 For example, abstract nouns can be formed by adding suffixes like -hood, -ship, -dom, -ness to native words in English
 lagbhag sabhi jarmenic bhashaaon main in sabhi ke sajaateey pratyay maujuud hai lekin unke upyog bhinn ho gaye hai, jaise kii german "free-hit" banaam angreji "free-dam" An English speaker can also read many French words easily because there is a large amount of adjustment of French and Norman words in English
 yah samaayojan norman vijay ke baad anglo-norman bhashaa se or baad kii sadiyon main sidhe french bhashaa se shabdon ko uthaane ke kaaran he
 As a result, a large part of the English vocabulary comes from the French language, with some minor spelling differences and differences in the meanings of so-called false friends
 The English pronunciation of most French single words is fully Englishized and follows a specific English method of emphasis

 angreji kii do shikshit sthaneey boliyon ko duniya ke adhikansh hisson main ek maanak ke taur par sweekrut kiya jaataa he- ek shikshit dakshini british par aadhaarit he or duusari shikshit madhyapashchimi american par aadhaarit he
 The former is sometimes called BBC English, a clan noted for its inclination towards "received pronunciation"; It follows the Cambridge model
 yah model europe, africa bhartiya upmahadweep or anya kshetron jo kii yaa to british rashtramandal se prabhavit hai yaa phir america ke saath pahachanakrut hone ke unicchuk hai, main anya bhashaaon ko bolne waalon ko angreji sikhaane ke liye ek maanak ke taur par kaam karti he
 The latter dialect, General American, extends to most of the United States and Canada
 yah america mahadwipon or america ke nikat sambandh main rahe athwa uski ichha rakhane vaale kshetron ke liye ek model ke taur par istemaal hoti he
 Apart from these two major dialects, there are several varieties of English, most of which include several sub-types, such as Cockney, Scouse and Geordie under British English; Newfoundland English under Canadian English; And African American Local English and South American English under American English
 English is a multi-centric language and does not have a central language authority like the 'acedimia francai' of France; Therefore, no one type is considered "right" or "wrong"
 scots kaa vikaas, mukhyatah swatantra rup se, samaan mul se hua tha lekin sangh ke adhinium 1707 ke pashchaat bhashaa sangharshan kii ek prakriya aarambh hui jiske tahat uttarottar pidhiyon ne angreji ke zyada se zyada lakshanon ko apanaaya iske parinamswaroop yah angreji kii ek boli ke rup main viksit ho gayi
 Currently, there is a dispute as to whether it is a separate language or simply a dialect of English, which has been given the name of Scottish English
 paaramparik prakaaron ke uccharan, vyakaran or shabd bhandar angreji kii anya kismon se bhinn, kabhi kabhaar baari maatra main, hai
 Due to the widespread use of English as a second language, there are different types of accents of its speakers, which reveal the local dialect or language of the speaker
 kshetreey lahazon kii adhik vishisht visheshtaon ke liye 'angreji ke kshetreey lahazon' ko dekhen or kshetreey boliyon kii adhik vishisht visheshtaon ke liye angreji bhashaa kii boliyon kii soochi ko dekhen
 england main, vyakaran yaa shabdkosh ke bajaay antar ab uccharan tak hi simit rah gaya he
 Variations in grammar and vocabulary were found throughout the country during the survey of English dialects, but most of the variations have been eliminated due to a process of attrition of word storage
 jis prakaar angreji ne apane itihaas ke dauraan swayan duniya ke kai hisson se shabdon kaa istemaal kiya he, usee prakaar angreji ke udharshabda bhi duniya kii kai bhashaaon main dikhaai dete hai
 This indicates the technical and cultural impact of its speakers
 angreji aadhaarit anek pigin or creole bhashaaon kaa gathan kiya gaya he, jaise kii jamcon petois, nigerian pigin or tok pisin
 angreji shabdon kii bharmaar vaali gaiyr angreji bhashaaon ke prakaaron kaa varnan karne ke liye angreji bhashaa main anek shabdon kii rachana kii gayi he
 Here * means to mark those vowels which are not in the sound system of Hindi, or which most Indians are not able to pronounce properly
 angreji ek intonaton bhashaa he
 This means that the fluctuation of speech is used according to the situation
 udahaaran ke taur par, aashcharya athwa vyangy vyakt karnaa, yaa ek vaktavy ko prashn main badalanaa
 In English, intonation patterns occur on a group of words known as tone groups, tone units, intonation groups, or sense groups
 tone samoohon ko ek hi saans main kaha jaataa he, is kaaran se inaki lambaai simit rahati he
 These are on average five words long and are finished in about two seconds
 udhaaharan ke liye : English is a very spoken language
 shabdon or vaakyon, donon ke kuch shabdaanshon ko uccharan ke samay apekshaakrit adhik mahatva / jor miltaa he jabaki anya ko nahin
 pehle prakaar ke shabdaanshon ko axcentuated / stressd kaha jaataa he or baad waalon ko anexentuated / anstroped 
 Thus each tone group in a sentence can be divided into syllables which will be either stressed or unstressed
 The stressed syllable is called the nuclear syllable
 udhaaharan ke liye: Was the best thing you could have done! ' yahaan saare shabdaansh anstroped hai, sivaay best or dan ke, jo kii stressd hai
 The emphasis on BEST is slightly higher, hence the nuclear syllable
 newclear shabdaansh vaktaa ke mukhya bindu kaa varnan karata he
 for example: yah bhi It can also be used to express emotion: newclear shabdaanshon ko zyada unche swar main bolaa jaataa he or inako bolne ke lahaze main ek vishisht badlaav hota he
 The most common variations of this tone are the raising of the voice and lowering of the voice, although the falling voice and the falling sound are also used occasionally
 anya bhashaaon kii apeksha angreji bhashaa main aawaaj ko unchaa or nicha karne kaa mahatva kahin adhik he
 Speaking in a low voice indicates certainty and speaking in a loud voice indicates uncertainty
 This can have a significant impact on meaning, especially in showing positive or negative attitudes; Speaking in a low voice means your "point of view" and a rising voice means "point of view"
 haan / nahin vaale prashnon kii chadhati hui aawaaj ke peeche bhi yahi he
 for example: swar prayek kshetra main bhinn bhinn hote hai
 Where symbols are visual in pairs, the first corresponds to the common American pronunciation of American English, the second corresponds to the received pronunciation of British English
 yah angreji vyanjan pranali he jo antarrashtriya dhvanyatmak varnmaala se pratikon kaa prayog kar rahi he
 Speech and aspirations of stop consonants in English depend on dialect and context, but only a few general rules can be given: anya indo-european bhashaaon kii tulana main angreji main nunatam mode hote hai
 For example, modern English, unlike modern German or Dutch and romance languages, lacks gender grammar and adjective agreement
 cese marking bhashaa se lagbhag gaayab ho chuki he or aaj iskaa istemaal mukhya rup se sarvnaam main hi kiya jaataa he
 The form of strong versus weak verbs derived from Germanic origin has gained importance in modern English and the use of curved remains has increased
 varttman main bhashaa adhik vishleshnatmakaban gayi he or arth spasht karne ke liedyotak kriya or shabd kram jaise sadhano kaa vikaas hua he
 Auxiliary verbs denote questions, negativity, passive voice and progressive aspects
 chunki angrezi ek germanik bhashaa he, uski adhiktar dainik upyog kii shabdaawalee pracheen german se aayi he
 Apart from this, there are many negative words in English
 ek surveykshan ke anusaar sthiti ye he: The English vocabulary has changed considerably over the centuries
 proto-indo-european se nikali anek bhashaaon kii tarah angreji ke sabase aam shabdon ke mul ko PIE main khoja ja saktaa he
 These words include basic pronouns such as "I, from the Old English word ic, m, numbers", duo, tris), common family relationships such as mother, father, brother, sister etc
, many animal names and many common Activities jarmenic shabd angreji ke latin shabdon se zyada chote hote hai or saamaanya bolchaal main inkaa upyog zyada aam he
 It includes almost all the basic pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, denotative verbs etc
 that make up the basic syntax and grammar of English
 lambe latin shabdon ko aksar zyada alankrita or shikshit mana jaataa he
 However, excessive use of Latin words is considered to be an attempt to show off or hide the issue
 jorj orwell kaa niabandh "raajnneeti or angreji" is cheez or bhashaa ke anya kathith durupayogon kii aalochana karata he
 This essay is considered an important review of the English language
 ek angreji bhashi ko latin or jarmenic paryaayavaachiyon main se chayan karne kii suvidha milti he: kam yaa arive ; sait yaa vijan ; freedom yaa liberty 
 kuch maamalon main, ek jarmenic vyutpann shabd, ek latin vyutpann shabd or samaan latin shabd se vyutpann ek french shabd main se chayan karne kaa vikalp rahata he
 These synonyms, incorporating diverse meanings and nuances, help the speakers to express nuances and differences of views
 paryaayavachi shabd samoohon ke itihaas kaa gyaan angraji vaktaa ko apnibhasha par adhik niyantran pradaan kar saktaa he
 See: List of Germanic and Latin equivalents in English
 is baat kaa ek apwaad or ek visheshta he jo shaayad keval angraji bhashaa main hi pai jaati he
 That is, the noun of meat is usually different and unrelated to the noun of the animal it provides
 jaanavar kaa aamtaur par jarmenic naam hota he or gosht kaa french se vyutpann hota he
 Examples, deer and venison; Cow and Beef; Pigs / Pig and Pork, and Sheep and Mutton
 This is considered the result of the Norman invasion, where the French-speaking aristocracy ate the meat provided by the anglo-saxon lower class
 kisi bahes ke dauraan apni baat ko sidhe taur par prakat karne ke liye vaktaa in shabdon kaa istemaal karnaa pasand karte hai kyonki anaupchaarik parivesh main prayukt adhikansh shabd aamtaur par jarmenic hote hai
 Most Latin words are commonly used in formal speech or writing, such as a court or an encyclopedic article
 However, there are other Latin words that are commonly used in general colloquial and do not appear to be too formal; These words are primarily for concepts that no Germanic word has survived
 sandarbh se inkaa talmail behatar hota he or kai maamalon main ye latin bhi prathit nahin hote hai
 For example, all these words are Latin: mountain, valley, river, aunt, uncle, walk, use push and stay
 angreji aasaani se takneekee shabdon ko sweekaar karti he or aksar nae shabdon or vaakyon ko aayaat bhi karti he
 Examples are contemporary words such as cookie, internet and URL, gener, uber, lingua franca and amigo
 In addition, typical words often impart new meaning to old words and phrases
 vastav main, yah dravyata itani spasht he kii angreji ke samakaleen upyog or uske aupchaarik prakaaron main aksar bhed karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 there is absolutely no defining line in any direction: the circle of the English language has a well-defined center but no discernible circumference
 angreji shabdaawalee beshak vishaal he, parantu isko ek sankhya pradaan karnaa gananaa se adhik paribhaasha ke tahat aayegaa
 french, german, italvi or spanish bhashaaon ke vipareet, angreji bhashaa ke liye adhikarik taur par sweekrut shabdon or matraaon ko paribhaashit karne ke liye koi academy nahin he
 Neologisms are being created regularly in medicine, science, technology and other fields and new slang is constantly evolving
 inamen se kuch nae shabdon kaa vyapak ietemaal hota he; anya chote daayaron tak hi simit rahete hai
 Foreign words used in immigrant communities often make their way into widespread English usage
 pracheen, upboli or kshetreey shabdon ko vyapak taur par "angreji" kaha bhi ja saktaa he or nahin bhi
 The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition contains more than 6 million definitions, following the overall policy: It embraces not only the standard language of literature and conversation, whether current at the moment, or obsolete, or archaic, but also the main technical vocabulary, and a large measure of dialectal usage and slang 
 The editors of Webster's third new international dictionary, without layoffs, estimate this number to be much higher in his preface
 aisa anumaan he kii lagbhag 25,000 shabd har saal bhashaa main judate hai
 One consequence of the French influence is that the English vocabulary has been somewhat divided into Germanic and Latin words
 angreji ke 1000 sabase aam shabdon main se 83% or 100 sabase aam main se puure 100 jarmenic hai
 Conversely, most of the more advanced words in subjects like science, philosophy, mathematics come from Latin or Greek
 khagol vigyaan, ganit or rasayan vigyaan se ullekhneey sankhya main shabd arabi se aaye hai
 Numerous figures have been presented to demonstrate the proportional roots of the English vocabulary
 adhikansh bhashavidon ke anusaar abhi tak iname se koi bhi nishchit nahin he
 a computerized survey of about 80,000 words from the Old Small Oxford Dictionary was published in Ordained Profusion by Thomas Finkenstadt and Dieter Wolfe, estimating the origin of English words as follows: joseph em
 williams dwaara origins of da english language main hajaaron vyavsaayik patron se liye gaye 10,000 shabdon ke ek surveykshan ne ye aankde prastut kiye: Many words describing the navy, types of ships, other objects and water operations are of Dutch origin
 udahaaran, yot, skipper or crusar 
 dach kaa angreji slang main bhi yogadan he, udahaaran, spooke, ab aprachlit shabd snidar or stiver 
 a large part of the English vocabulary is of French origin, with most of the words coming from anglo-norman
 anglo-norman bhashaa norman kii england vijay ke baad ucch virgon dwaara saikadon saalon tak boli jaati thi
 For example, competition, art, table, publicity, polis, roll, routine, machine, force, and many other words that have either been or are being Englishized; Many are now pronounced under the rules of phonology of English rather than French
 nauveen shatabdi ke aasapaas se angreji ke lekhan ke liye anglo-sexn roons ke sthaan par latin varnmaala kaa prayog ho rahaa he
 The spelling system, or orthography, is multi-layered
 isamen sthaneey jarmenic pranali ke upar french, greek or latin vartanee ke tatv shaamil hai; bhashaa ke dhwani vigyaan se yah kaaphi hat gaya he
 There is often a considerable difference in the pronunciation and spelling of words
 haalaanki akshar or dhwani algaav main mail nahin khate hai, phir bhi shabd sanrachana, dhwani or lahazon ko dhyaan main rakhkar banaaye gaye vartanee niyam 75% vishwasaneey hai
 Some phonetic spelling advocates claim that English is more than 80% phonetic
 haalaanki anya bhashaaon kii apeksha angreji main akshar or dhwani ke bich sambandh utana pragadh nahin he; udahaaran, dhwani anukram ough ko saat bhinn prakaaron se uccharit kiya ja saktaa he
 The result of this complex orthographic history is that reading can be a challenging task
 greek, french or spanish or kai anya bhashaaon kii tulana main, ek chaatr ko angreji pathan kaa paarangat banane main zyada vakt lagata he
 Only consonant letters are pronounced in a relatively regular way: adhikansh jarmenic bhashaaon ke vipareet, angreji main dyacritics, sivaay videshi udharshabdon ke, lagbhag nahin ke baraabar hai or do swaron ke uccharan ko ek dhwani kii bajaay pruthak darshane ke liye diarisis nishaan ke asaamaanya upyog main 
debor, cafe, resyum, entry, fiansi or nive jaise shabd aksar donon tareekon se likhe jate hai
 The diacritics are often added to the word to denote them of "high order"
 haal main, angreji bhashit deshon main kai computer kunjeepatalon main prabhavi visheshak kunjiyon ke abhaav ke kaaran caf'e yaa cafe' jaise computer se utpann chihnon kaa prachlan bad gaya he
 Some English words retain diacritics to distinguish themselves
 udahaaran, animé, exposé, lamé, öre, øre, pâté, piqué, and rosé, haalaanki aksar inako chhod bhi diya jaataa he 
 uccharan ko spasht karne ke liye kuch udhaar shabd dyacritic kaa upyog kar sakate hai, haalaanki mul shabd main yah maujuud nahin tha
 Eg, maté, from Spanish yerba mate) duniya bhar ke shikshit angreji vaktaaon dwaara lagbhag saarvbhaumik rup se sweekrut bhashaa ke ek sanskaran ko aupchaarik likhit angreji kaha jaataa he
 Its written type remains the same almost everywhere, in contrast to which the English language differs according to dialects, accents, types of slang, local and regional expressions
 bhashaa ke aupchaarik likhit sanskaran main sthaneey bhinnataayen kaaphi simit hai
 The scope of this variation is limited to the spelling differences of British and American English
 angreji pathan ko asana karne ke liye iske kuch sarlikrut sanskaran bhi maujuud hai
 One of these is Basic English, formed by Charles K
 Ogden with limited words and describes it in his book Basic English: a General Introduction with Rules and Grammar
 yah bhashaa angreji ke ek sarlikrut sanskaran par aadhaarit he
 Ogden said that it would take seven years to learn English, seven months for Esperanto and only seven days for basic English
 Companies that require complex books for international use, as well as schools that teach people basic English in a short period of time, can use Basic English
 ogden ne basic english main aisa koi shabd nahin daalaa jise kuch anya shabdon ke saath bolaa ja sake or anya bhashaaon ke vaktaaon ke liye bhi ye shabd kaam karen, is baat kaa bhi usne khyaal rakhaa
 apane shabdon ke samooh par usne badi sankhya main pareekshan or sudhaar kiye
 usne na sirf vyakaran ko saral banaaya, varan upyogkartaaon ke liye vyakaran ko saamaanya rakhane kii bhi koshish kii
 Soon after the Second World War, it received a lot of publicity as a tool for world peace
 Although it was not converted into a program, other similar versions were created for various international uses
 ek anya sanskaran, sarlikrut angreji, maujuud he jo kii ek niyantrit bhashaa he jiskaa gathan mul rup se airospes udyog ke rakrakhaav minial ke liye kiya gaya tha
 It provides a limited and standardized subgroup of English
 sarlikrut angreji main anumodith shabdon kaa ek shabdkosh he or un shabdon ko kuch vishisht myanon main hi istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 For example, the word close may be used in the phrase "close the door" but "do not go close to the landing gear"
 angrezon ne duniya ke anek deshon ko raajnneetik rup se apana upnivesh banaaya
 Along with this, they also imposed English cleverly on those countries
 isi kaa parinaam he ki aaj britain ke baahar san raa america, austrailia, newjiland, canada, bharat, pakistan, bangladesh, dakshin africa aadi anek deshon main angrezi kaa varchasv he
 English has severely paralyzed the native languages here
 british counsil jaisi santhaayen is angrezi ke prasar ke liye tarah-tarah ke dushprachaar evam gupt abhiyaan karti rahati hai
 But as a mother tongue, Hindi and Chinese language has surpassed English
 Wikipedia's India estimate of 350 million includes two categories - "english Speakers" and "english Users"
 The distinction between the Speakers and Users is that Users only know how to read English words while Speakers know how to read English, understand spoken English as well as form their own sentences to converse in English
 The distinction becomes clear when you consider the China numbers
 China has over 200~350 million users that can read English words but, as anyone can see on the streets of China, only handful of million who are English speakers
 Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150
 
 
 Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of the word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a word, or have themselves a certain literary currency
 bhagadanu, garuda tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke bageshwar jile kaa ek gaanv he
 In the hornbostel-sax classification of musical instruments, vibrations or idiophones are instruments whose entire body trembles without the use of membranes or filaments and produces sounds from that vibration

 On his return to Nagpur in 1915, he became active in the Congress and later became the secretary of the Vidarbha Provincial Congress
 When the country level session of the Congress was held in Nagpur in 1920, Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar presented the first proposal in the Congress about the goal of complete independence, then it was not passed
 In 1921, Satyagraha was arrested in the non-cooperation movement of the Congress and he was imprisoned for one year
 By then he had become so popular that veterans like Pandit Motilal Nehru and Hakim Ajmal Kha addressed the gathering organized to welcome him upon his release
 congress main puri tanmanyata ke saath bhagidaari or jail jivan ke dauraan jo anubhav paae ,usase vah yah sochane ko pravruth hue ki samaaj main jis ekta or dhundhlee padi deshbhakti kii bhaavana ke kaaran ham paratantr hue he vah keval congress ke jan aandolan se jaagrit or prisht nahi ho sakati | jan-tantra ke paratantraa ke viruddh vidroh kii bhaavana jagaane kaa kaary beshak chalata rahe lekin raashtra jivan main gahari huyi vighatanvaadee pravriti ko dur karne ke liye kuch bhinn upaay kii jarurat he | da

 This was the reason that when the anti-salt law movement was launched by Mahatma Gandhi in December 1930, he personally handed over the responsibility of the Sangh chief to Dr
 Parapanje along with a dozen of his colleagues, in which he was imprisoned for 9 months
 Similarly, in 1929 when the resolution of the former Swaraj was passed in the Congress session held in Lahore and on 26 January 1930, a call was made to hoist the tricolor across the country, on the instructions of Dr
 Hedgewar Dr
 Keshav Rao Baliram Hedgewar in all the Sangh branches on January 30
 It was resolved to attain full swaraj by hoisting the tricolor

 As soon as he did his medical career, he realized his sharp leadership talent and was nominated as Vice President of the Hindu Mahasabha Bengal region
 kalkatte main padhai karte hue unka mail-milaap bengal ke krantikariyon se hua
 Since Keshav lived in Calcutta at the home of his elder brother Mahadev's friend Shyam Sundar Chakraborty, the local people used to know and address him by the name of Keshav Chakraborty
 unki asaadhaaran yogyata ko maddenjar rakhte hue unhen pehle anushilan samiti kaa saadhaaran sadsy banaaya gaya
 After that, when he stood the test of efficiency, he was also made an internal member of the committee

 He actively collaborated with Dr
 Munje during the 1923 riots in Nagpur
 agle saal saavarkar ke patr hindutv kaa sanskaran niklaa jisamen inkaa yogadan bhi tha
 It was with his original manuscript
 1921 i
 main angrejo ne turki ko parrast kar, vahaan ke sultan ko gaddi se utaar diya tha, vahi sultan musalamaanon ke khalipha / mukhiya bhi kehalaate the, ye baat bharat va anya muslim deshon ke musalamaanon ko nagavar gujri jisase jagah-jagah aandolan hue l hindusthan main khaskar kerala ke malabar jile main aandolan ne ugr rup le liya l Muslim communalism started raising its head only after Gandhi's arrival on India's political scene in 1922 AD

 In such a situation, many Hindu leaders went to malabar-kerala to know the state of Kerala and to help the looted Hindus there, among them prominent Hindu Mahasabhai leader of Nagpur, Dr
 Balkrishna Shivram Munje, Dr
 Hedgewar, Arya Samaj leader Swami Shraddhanand ji etc
 After a while, there were hindu-muslim riots in Nagpur and many other cities too
 Distracted by such incidents, Dr
 Munje in Nagpur has made some famous Convened Ndu leaders, including Dr
 Hedgewar and Dr
 Paranjpe were also at the meeting, he decided to build a Hindu militia, was aimed at "the Hindus make a strong Hindu nation to protect and Hindustan" l this militia Dharamvir Dr
 Munje gave the responsibility of standing to Dr
 Keshav Baliram Hedgewar
 dosahab aise vyakti the, jinhone vyakti kii kshamtaaon ko ubhaarne ke liye naye-naye taur-tareeke viksit kiye
 However, keeping in mind the unsuccessful revolution and erstwhile circumstances of the first Indian independence struggle, he laid the foundation of a paramilitary organization

 To make it run smoothly, posts of teacher, head teacher, event etc

 If other people give it through communication If you want to settle in, then you can definitely settle
 We have never denied them, but we will not get even a single place here for those who come to our house as guests and take a knife on our neck

 This principle retained its influence on the economic system for a long time

 Firstly, it was seen that the economic system does not follow any policy or guideline due to lack of guidance by the government, due to which many social and economic weaknesses come in it

 In mathematics, the Dirichle test is a method of testing the convergence of a range
 iskaa namakaran iske lekhak peter gustaaf lajan diricklay ke 'jarnal di mathematics pyor at appaliqiks' main prakaashan ke baad unke maranoparant kiya gaya
 According to the test statement if {an} { \ displaystyle \ {a_ {n} \ }} is a real sequence and {bn} { \ displaystyle \ {b_ {n} \ }} is a composite sequence that satisfies the following relations Huh: jahaan m ek niyatank he, tab shrenee Will converge
 mana s n = ∑ k = 0 n a k b k { \ displaystyle S_{n}= \ sum _{k=0}^{n}a_{k}b_{k}} or b n = ∑ k = 0 n b k { \ displaystyle B_{n}= \ sum _{k=0}^{n}b_{k}} he
 By compiling the components we have s n = an + 1 b n + ∑ k = 0 n b k { \ displaystyle S_ {n} = a_ {n + 1} B_ {n} + \ sum _ {k = 0} ^ { n} B_ {k}}
 chunki a n → 0 { \ displaystyle a_{n} \ rightarrow 0} ke liye b n { \ displaystyle B_{n}} m se paribaddh he, n→∞ ke liye ye pad shunya kii ore agrasar a n + 1 b n → 0 { \ displaystyle a_{n+1}b_{n} \ to 0} honge
 By the other method, since the sequence an { \ displaystyle a_ {n}} is decreasing, ak - ak + 1 { \ displaystyle a_ {k} -a_ {k + 1}} is positive for all k, so | b k | ≤ m { \ displaystyle | B_ {k} | \ leq M}
 atah Bn kaa aanshik yoga or uske gunak kaa maan Bn kaa aanshik yoga or samaan gunaj se kam hoga
 But ∑ k = 0 n m = m ∑ k = 0 n { \ displaystyle \ sum _ {k = 0} ^ {n} m = m \ sum _ {k = 0} ^ {n}}, which is an interpolation range

 1
 pashchimi europe kii suraksha ke tahat banaae gaye naaton sanghathan ne pashchimi europe ke ekikaran ko bal pradaan kiya
 It established immense cooperation among its members
 2
 itihaas main pehali baar pashchimi europe kii shaktiyon ne apni kuch senaaon ko sthaayee rup se ek antarrashtriya sainya sanghathan kii adheenta main rakhana sweekaar kiya

 5
 The formation of NATO gave impetus to the Cold War
 soviet sangh ne ise samyawad ke virodh main dekha or pratyuttar main warsaw pact naamak sainya sanghathan kar purvi europea deshon main apana prabhaav jamaane kii koshish kii

 NATO also influenced US foreign policy
 uski vaidshik niti ke khilaaf kisi bhi tarah ke vaad-pratwaad ko sunne ke liye taiyaar nahin rahi or nato ke madhyam se america kaa europe main atyadhik hastkshep badha

 America's excessive intervention in Europe forced European countries to think that Europe's socio-economic problems should be solved from a European point of view
 is drushtikon ne “europea samudaay” ke gathan kaa maarg prashast kiya
 After the establishment of NATO, war between these two superpowers in the world and especially in Europe, the US and the then Soviet Union took a dangerous turn and the Soviet Union in collaboration with the socialist countries of Eastern Europe in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, to counter NATO, Warsaw Pact established

 kintu america ne naaton ko bhang nahin kiya balki america netritv main naaton kaa or vistaar hi hua

 sheet yudhottar kaal main america dwaara naaton kii bhoomika punarparibhaashit kii gai
 It said that it is a means of mutual cooperation and development of relations in regions across Europe
 itnaa hi nahin prajatantric mulyon va aadarshon ke vikaas evam prasar main bhi naaton kii bhoomika ko vaid banane kaa prayaas kiya
 The US took nato's role out of factional politics in the Cold War and gave it a global appearance
 nato ko ab shanti sthapana ke antargat mahatvapurn mana ja rahaa he
 At the same time, its role in the elimination of international terrorism is also being underlined
 nimnlikhit binduon ke antargat shityudhottar kaaleen naaton kii bhoomika evam vistaar ko dekha ja saktaa he- In its expansion, NATO emerged as a major representative in Europe
 sheet yuddh ke kaal main jo pashchim europe ke ekikaran kaa pratinidhitiv karata tha vahi nato shityudhottar kaal main sampoorn europe ke ekikaran kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Despite the positive statements in favor of NATO expansion, it is also criticized
 vastutah nato kii bhoomika shanti sthapana, aapasi sahyog aadi ke sambandh main sanyukt raashtra sangh kii bhoomika kaa hanan karti he
 The thing to understand is that the United Nations was established as an international institution aimed at world peace while NATO was established as a regional organization
 kintu iske baavjood antarrashtriya sandarbh main shanti sthapana hetu nato kii bhoomika yuano ke samanaantar dikhti he

 aapane shikshaarthi ke rup main kai mahatvapurn kaary kiye
 In 1906, your first research paper on light diffraction was published in the Philosophical Journal of London
 uskaa sheershak tha - 'ytaakrit chhidr ke kaaran utpann aseemit vivartan pattiyaan'
 When rays of light pass through an aperture or on the edge of an opaque object and fall on a screen, stripes of sharp or colored light appear on the edge of the rays

 Between them, different types of chemical substances are placed and the light of the transparent arc passes through them to form a spectrum
 aapane dekha ki har ek spectrum main antar padataa he
 Each substance makes its own difference

 Macdonald hindi or urdu bhartiya upmahadweep main boli jane vaali do pramukh bhashaayen hai
 At present, Hindi is a caste written mainly in Devanagari script while Urdu is mainly in Nastaliq
 donon kii saamaanya shabdaawalee bhi bahut seemaa tak samaan he, vishesh sandarbhon main hindi main sanskrit shabdon kii adhikta ho jaati he jabaki urdu main farsi or arabi shabdon kii
 Many people believe that apart from namdebha, lipabdha and stylbhade, both are the same language, not separate
 prasiddh samalochak ramvilas sharma kaa mat he ki itihaas main ham jitna hi peeche kii taraf chalate hai, utana hi hindi-urdu kaa bhed kam dikhaai detaa he
 He also says that Hindi and Urdu have the same grammar, their pronouns and verbs are the same
 aisa do bhinn bhashaaon main nahin hota
 Hindi and Bangla have different grammar
 aadhunik sahitya kii rachana khadi boli main hui he
 Khadi dialect, the language which was made with the combination of arabic-persian in Hindi, was called 'urdu'
 musalamaanon ne 'urdu' kaa prayog chhavnee, shahi lashkar or kile ke arth main kiya he
 The practical language spoken in these places was 'urdu ki Bhasha'
 pehle-pehle bolchaal ke liye dilli ke saamaanya musalmaan jo bhashaa vyavhaar main laate the vah hindi hi thi
 In the fourteenth century, when Muhammad Tughlaq moved his capital from Delhi to Devagiri, the westerners who went there also took their common language with them
 praayah pandrahavin shatabdi main bijapur, golkunda aadi musalamaani rajyon main sahitya ke str par is bhashaa kii pratishtha hui
 At that time, the literary language in the Muslim state of North India was Persian
 dakshinbharat main telugu aadi dravid bhashabhashiyon ke bich uttar bharat kii is arya bhashaa ko farsi lipi main likhaa jaataa tha
 This Dakhini language is called Urdu scholar Urdu
 shuru main dakhini bolchaal kii khadi boli ke bahut nikat thi
 Hindi and Sanskrit words were used extensively in this
 chand bhi adhiktar hindi ke hi hote the
 But from the sixteenth century, the Arabic Persian movement in Dakhini started increasing gradually by the Sufis and the courtiers of Bijapur, Golconda etc
 phir bhi atharahavin shatabdi ke aarambh tak iskaa rup pradhanthya hindi yaa bhartiya hi rahaa
 Around 1700, the famous poet of Dakhini, Shams Waliullah 'wali' came to Delhi
 yahan aane par shuru main to vali ne apni kavyabhasha dakhini hi rakhi, jo bhartiya vaataavaran ke nikat thi
 But later, the arabic-persian tradition of his works was introduced
 aarambh kii dakhini main farsi prabhaav kam miltaa he
 Later on Urdu of Delhi was accentuated by Persian vocabulary and deep color of foreign environment
 hindi ke shabd dhundkar nikaal phenke gaye or unki jagah arabi farsi ke shabd baithaae gaye
 When Lucknow became the second center of Urdu during the decline of the Mughal Empire, it removed its Hindiness even more vigilantly
 ab vah apane mul hindi se bahut bhinn ho gai
 a mixed form of Hindi and Urdu has been called Hindustani
 bharat main angarej shaskaon kii kootneeti ke falswaroop hindi or urdu ek duusare se dur hoti gayi
 One's Sanskritism increased and the other's Persianism
 lipibhed to tha hi
 From the point of view of cultural environment, the separation of both increased
 aisi sthiti main angarejon ne ek aisi mishrit bhashaa ko hindustani naam diya jisamen arabi, farsi yaa sanskrit ke kathin shabd na prayukt hon tathaa jo saadhaaran janata ke liye sahajabodhya ho
 Later on the country diplomats also tried to recognize such language and said that it can be written in both Persian and Nagari scripts
 par yah kritrim prayaas antatogatva vifal hua
 This type of language was more inclined towards Urdu
 bhashavid hindi evam urdu ko ek hi bhashaa maanate hai
 Hindi is written in Devanagari script and mostly uses Sanskrit words at the level of vocabulary
 urdu urdu lipi main likhi jaati he or shabdaawalee ke str par us par farsi or arabi bhashaaon kaa prabhaav adhik he
 Grammatically there is almost 100 percent similarity between Urdu and Hindi - only in certain areas there is a difference in the source of vocabulary
 kuch vishesh dhvaniyaan urdu main arabi or farsi se lee gayi hai or isi prakaar farsi or arabi kii kuch vishesh vyakaranik sanrachana bhi prayog kii jaati he
 Therefore, Urdu can be considered as a special style of Hindi
 profesar mahavir saran jain ne apane " hindi evam urdu kaa advait " sheershak aalekh main hindi evam urdu kii bhashik ekta kaa pratipaadan kiya he saath hi hindi sahitya evam urdu sahitya ke algaav ke kaarnon ko bhi spasht kiya he
 According to Professor Jain, "there is no difference between 'grammar' in hindi-urdu
 apvadswarup sambandhkaarak chinh tathaa bahuvachan pratyay ko chhodkar
 Hindi is spoken in the dialects, dialects, practical Hindi, standard Hindi- 'ghalib ka Diwan'
 urdu kii theth style main kaha jayega - ' diwane gaalib '
 In Hindi, the denominational factor of 'house' will be called 'house' in the plural sentence
 'uske teen makaan'
 In Urdu, the plural is used by adding 'aat' to 'house' - 'makanat'
 vikari kaarak bahuvachan vaakya main prayog hone par hindi-urdu main 'on' jodakar 'makaanon' hi bolaa jayega
 'drop houses' - This is also used in Hindi and in Urdu
 kuch shabdon kaa prayog hindi main streeling main tathaa urdu main pulling main hota he
 'fresh News' in Hindi and 'fresh News' in Urdu
 is prakaar kaa antar 'pashchimi-hindi' tathaa 'purvi-hindi' kii upbhaashaon main kai shabdon ke prayog main miltaa he
 Barring these, the grammar of hindi-urdu is one
 chunki inkaa grammer ek he is kaaran hindi-urdu bhashaa kii drushti se ek he
 Therefore, there does not seem to be any difference between the two in conversation
 'saahitiyik bhashaa' main bhashaa ke alaava anya bahut se tatv hote hai
 There is a story in literature, there is a metaphor for someone, there is an ornamented style, there is a description in a symbol, there are verses
 prayek desh ke sahitya kii apni parampara hoti he, katha, kathanak, kathanak-roodhiyon, alankaar-yojana, pratik-yojana, bimb-yojana, chand-vidhaan kii visheshtaayen hoti hai
 In a language form, two literary styles of 'hindi-urdu' developed
 ek style 'aadhunik hindi sahitya' kehalaati he jisamen bhartiya pratikon, upmaanon, bimbon, chhandon tathaa sanskrit kii tatsam evam bharat ke jansamaj main prachlit shabdon kaa prayog hota he tathaa jo devanagari lipi main likhi jaati he
 The 'urdu' style writers made more use of symbols, epithets, images, verses prevalent in Arabic and Persian literature
 jab arabi-farsi adab kii parampara ke anuroop yaa usase prabhavit hokar sahitya likhaa jaataa he to rachana main arabi sahitya tathaa farsi-sahitya main prayukt hone vaale shabdon kaa bahul prayog to hota hi he, uske saath-saath shailigat upaadaanon tathaa lay or chand main bhi antar ho jaataa he jisase rachana kii zamin or aasmaan badale-badale nazar aane lagate hai
 If the plot is based on Ramayana or Mahabharata, then 'composition-environment' is of a type, if the plot is based on the stories of 'laila-majnu', 'yusuf-zulekha', 'sheeri-farhad' then 'composition- The atmosphere is of another type
 upama 'camel' se yaa chaand se di jaati he to ped kii ek shakha par jis rang or khushboo vaale phool khilte hai, usase bhinn rang or khushboo vaale phool ped kii duusari shakha par tab khilne lagate hai jab upmaan 'abe jamajam', 'kohenur', 'shamaa', 'bulbul' aadi ho jate he
 In spoken language, all those who speak 'hindi-urdu' use the words bread, water, cloth, house, air, milk, curd, day, night, hands, feet, waist, thirst, love, sleep, dream, etc
 equally
 But when 'chanda Udta Hua' and 'mahtaab Uruj Gaya' are written by one genre litterateur for 'chand Uga', the same language stream starts flowing in two different flows

 pushp, athwa phool, janan sanrachana he jo paudhon main paae jate hai
 It is called
 phool-paudhon ke prajnan avyav ke saath-saath, phulon ko insaanon / manushyon ne saraahaa he or istemaal bhi kiya he, khaskar apane mahole ko sajaane ke liye or khaadya ke strot ke rup main bhi
 Each flower has its own special type of structure to encourage pollen
 kiliestogamas phool swaparagit hote hai, jiske baad ve khul bhi sakate hai yaa shaayad nahin bhi
kai prakaar ke viola or salvi prajatiyon main is prakaar ke phool hote hai
 Insectivorous flowers attract insects, bats, birds and animals and use them to transfer pollen from one flower to another
 saamanytah phulon ke anek bhaagon main ek granthi hoti he jise paraag kaha jaataa he jo in kiton ko aakarshith karti hai
 Some flowers have structures called madhursa instructions that tell pollinators where to find honey
 phool paragakon ko khushboo or rang se bhi aakarshith karte hai
 Yet some flowers mimic or imitate to attract pollinators
 udhaaharan ke liye kuch orchid kii prajatiyaan phool srujit karti hai jo kii maadaa madhumakhi ke rang, aakaar or khushboo se mail khate hai
 Flowers are also experts in forms and stamens have such an arrangement that it is ensured that the pollen grains are transferred to the pollinator when it lands on its attracting Vastu
 However, the pollen transfers the pollen to the pistil in all the flowers that are arranged exactly equally
 vaataparageet phool vaayu kaa istemaal paraag ko ek phool se agle phool tak le jane main karte hai udahaaran ke liye ghaasein, santi vriksh, emborsia jati kii raig ghans or esar jati ke ped or jhaadiyaan
 unhen paragakon ko aakarshith karne kii zarurat nahin padati jis kaaran unki pravriti "dikhaawati phulon" kii nahin hoti
 aamtaur par nar or maadaa prajnan ang alag-alag phulon main paae jate hai, nar phulon main lambey lambey punkesar reshe hote hai jo kii antak main khule hote hai or maadaa falon main lambey-lambey pankh jaise strikesar hote hai
 Where the pollen of insecticidal flowers is large and glutinous, which is rich in protein, the pollen of aerated flowers is mostly small, very light and not so nutritious for insects
 phool-paudhe dwichhidranviy hote hai jo ki do prakaar ke chhidron kaa srijan karte hai
 Pollen and ovules are formed in separate organs, but a typical flower bears bisporangiate strobilus that has both organs
 phool ko ek sanshodhit tana kaha jaataa he, chote internodon or bering ke saath, iske nodes aise sanrachit hote hai jo kii ati sansodhit pattey ho sakate hai
 In short, the structure of a flower is on a modified stem at an anterior meristem, which does not grow continuously
 Flowers are attached to the plant in some ways
 yadi phool tane se jude nahin hote or unka nirmaan paton par hota he to unhen avrint kaha jaataa he jab phool kaa pushpan hota he, to use ek phuleey pushpan kaha jaataa he
 If the flowering flower ends in clusters of flowers, then each trunk that carries the flower is called pedicel
 pushpan vaala tana ek antak rup srujit karata hai jise phool kii kursi yaa uskaa patr kehete hai phool ke hisse patr ke upar vorl main vyavasthit hote hai
 The four main parts of the whorl are as follows: yaddapi upar varnit phulon kii sanrachana ko 'adarsh' sanrachanaatmak yojana mana ja saktaa he, parantu paudhon kii jati is yojana se hatakar badlaav ke vyapak bhinnata ko dikhaate hai
 These changes are very important in the development of flowering plants and botanists use it intensively to establish the relationship between plant species
 masalan phool-paudhon ki do upjatiyaan kaa bhed unke prayek vorl ke phuleey ango ko lekar ho saktaa he: ek dwibipatri ke vorl main adarsh rup main chaar yaa paanch ang hote hai or monocoteledon main teen yaa teen ke gunank vaale ang hote hai
 a group pistil may have only two carpels, or may not be related to the generalization of monocots and dicots given above
 jaisaa ki upar varnit kiya gaya he ki vyaktik phulon ke zyaadaatar naslon main jayang or punkesar dona hote hai
 Botanists describe these flowers as complete, bisexual, hermaphrodite
 phir bhi kuch paudhon ki naslon main phool apurna yaa ek lingeey hote hai: yaa to keval punkesar yaa strikesar angon ko dhaaran kiya hue
pehle maamle main agar ek vishesh paudha jo ki yaa to maadaa yaa purush he to aisi nasl ko dioisius mana jaataa he
 But if a sexual male or female flower appears on the same plant, such a species is called monoecious
 mul yojana se phulon ke badlaav par atirikt vichaar-vimarsh kaa ullekh phulon ke mul bhaagon vaale lekhon main kiya gaya he
 In species where there is more than one flower at the same peak, which is also called a joint flower - a collection of such flowers is also known as inflorescence, with the term having a specific arrangement on the stem of the flower
 can go
 is sambandh main dhyaan dene kaa abhyaas kiya janaa chahie ki "phool" kya he
 For example, in botany terminology, a daisy or a sunflower is not a flower but a flower has a head - a flower that holds many small flowers, each of these flowers will be described in the same physical way as they describe
 Has been done above
 bahut se phulon main avyav sanyog hota he, agar bahya bhaag kendriya shikhar se kisi bhi bindu par vibhajit hota he, to do sumail aadhe hisse srujit hote hai- to unhen niyat yaa samandharmee kaha jaataa he
 Eg rose or trillium
 When the flowers divide and form only a line that forms the components, such flowers are irregular or zygomorphic eg snapdragon / majus or mostly orchids
 ek phool kaa formula, ek tarika he jisase ek phool kii sanrachana kaa pratinidhitiv ek vishesh akshar, ank yaa pratik ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Instead of a particular species, a general formula is used to indicate the flowering structure of a plant family
 nimnlikhit pratinidhiyon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Ca = diaphragm Ca5 = Dalipule = petals in coefficient of some three) and NBSP; And NBSP; And NBSP; And NBSP; z if added zygomorphic a = stamens g = gynoecium x: "char sankhya" kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa ∞: anekon kaa pratinidhitiv karnaa The floral formula will look like this: kai atirikt chinhon kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he The primary purpose of flowering is reproduction
 Flowers are reproductive organs that mediate sperm from linking pollen to the ovule / testicles, normally from one plant to another, but many plants can pollinate their own flowers
 urvar paryand bijon kaa nirmaan karte hai jo kii aage kii pusht / peedhee hai

 Many plants depend on external factors for the transfer of pollen between flowers, including air and animals, especially pests
 Very large animals such as birds, bats, and dwarf poses can also be employed / employed / used
 The period of time in which this process takes place is called anthesis
 ko aakarshith karti hai
 Plants cannot move from one place to another, so many flowers grow in a dispersed population to attract animals to transfer pollen to each flower
 phool jo ki kit-paraagit hote hai unhen kitapargeey kaha jaataa hai jo kii latin main kit-premi ke rup main liya jaataa he
 These can be significantly modified with insects pollinated by co-development, usually in different parts of the flower there are glands called sweet organs that attract animals that are looking for nutritious sweet
 pakshiyon or madhumakhiyon main rang drushti hoti he, jo ki unhen "rangile" phool dhundne main yogya banaate hai
 Some flowers have madhuras directors / directives that show pollinators looking for madhuras, which can only be seen in ultraviolet light, which is visible only to bees and insects
 phool paraagan kartaaon ko gandh or kuch gandh hamaare soonghney kii shakti ke liye bhi sukhad hote hai
 The smell of all flowers does not appeal to humans, many flowers are pollinated by insects that are attracted to rotten flesh, and flowers that smell like dead animals, often called carrion flowers, include reflexia, titanarum and Paupau of North America

 The mechanism of pollination by the plant depends on how pollination is used

 Many flowers rely only on the proximity between the parts of the flower for pollination
 anya jaise kii sarasenia yaa maadaa sleeper orchid ke paas i sunishchit dhaancha hota he jo ki aatmaparagan kaa nirodh karte hue paraagan ko nishchit karata he
 Aphrodisiac flowers: Use of air to transport pollen from one flower to the next, for example grasses, Santi trees, rag grasses of Amboria species and Acer trees and shrubs
 They do not have to attract pollinators due to which they do not have a tendency to 'showy flowers'
 Where the pollen of insecticidal flowers is large and glutinous, which is rich in protein, the pollen of aerated flowers is mostly small, very light and not so nutritious for insects
 Bees and bumblebees actively accumulate aerated pollen corns, although they are not of much importance
 kuch phool swaparagit hote hai or un phulon kaa istemaal karte hai jo kabhi nahin khilte, yaa phool khilne se pehle swaparagit jo jate hai, in phulon ko clisotogamas kaha jaataa he kai prakaar ke viola or salvia prajatiyon main is prakaar ke phool hote hai
 Many flowers have close relationships with one or a few specific types of bacteria
 udahaaran ke liye kai phool ek vishisht keet jati se keval ek keet ko hi aakarshith karte hai, atah safal prajnan ke liye keval us keet par nirbhar karte hai
 This close relationship is often taken as an example of coexistence, as flowers and pollinators are believed to grow over a long period to match each other's needs

 Extreme cases of self-fertilization occur in flowers that are always self-fertile, such as many miscreants
 In contrast, many plant breeds have their own ways of preventing self-fertilization

 Pollen can disintegrate even without bright / golden and clear appearance, so it becomes an obligation to use the plant's resources until it provides no other benefit
 a proposed reason for the sudden presence of fully grown flowers is that they have evolved in a different environment, such as an island or chain of islands, where the plants that held them had a highly specialized relationship with certain animals
 Have evolved from, as in present-day / today, insular breeds / ethnicity

 a person who commits a crime is usually called a criminal, ie one who commits an illegal act by law or disregards the compulsory work prescribed by the law and causes harm to society by his work or its disregard
 bahudhaa kisi aparaadh se vyaktivishesh ko hi haani pahunchati he evam iske liye vah divaani nyaayalay main kshatipurti kii yachana kar saktaa he, kintu saamaajik shanti evam anushaasan kii drushti se bahut se aise bhi hen jinke liye apradhi ke viruddh dandabhiyog laakar use nyaayalay se dandit karnaa rajya kaa karttavya hota he

 Due to this, cases of criminal prosecution are brought against the criminals from the state itself and the person interviewed with the crime remains only a witness or an instrument
 samaaj kaa pratik vah vyakti mana jaataa he, jisamen saarvbhaum satta virajman ho
 Such ruling persons have different names in different countries
 yatha, england main raja, bharat main raashtrapati
 In the case of conviction, these are the names of the first party, although the Attorney General or Director of Public Prosecution may also be on the first side from the government

 Sometimes, along with the punishment, the offender has to suffer the detriment of civil rights and kidnapping of political rights

 Generally, for the completion of a crime, it is necessary to do it with a defective mind
 kintu apradhi kii swechha se hone par hi uskaa kaam aparaadh mana ja saktaa he
 Voluntary work or disregard of work is that which is desired to be done or not done
 at: kisi vyakti ne yadi achetan avasthaa main-yatha, nidrit hone par, atyant kam avasthaa rahane se, jadta yaa veikshiptata ke kaaran koi aparaadh kiya he to yah mana jaayga ki aisi paristhiti main uskaa mastishk kaam nahin kar rahaa tha

 Evidence cannot be given on this subject that a child under 14 years of age is capable of sexual intercourse due to physical development
 kintu yadi vah 14 saal se adhik avasthaa ke kisi vyakti ko sambhog kriya main sahaayta de to vah hoga
 No child below the age of 14 years will be considered an accomplice in unnatural crime under any circumstances
 14 saal se adhik avasthaa kaa prayek vyakti kanoon kii drushti main paryaapt gyaan rakhata he

 veikshiptata kaa pramanbhaar abhiyukt par he
 Expert evidence is not mandatory

 apradhi ko raja kinwa raashtrapati kii maraji kii avadhi paryant jail main rakhaa jaataa he
 The culprit cannot be called guilty or punished
 at: use apil karne kaa adhikaar nahin rahata

 arthath yadi yah kaha jaay ki aparaadh ke samay apradhi kii medhasakti thik thi, kintu uskaa naitik chintan skhlit ho chukaa tha athwa vah mastishk ke asanyamit pravaah ke vasheebhoot hokar medha shakti ke rahete hue bhi aparaadh kar baitha, to uskaa aparaadh kshamya nahin hoga

 yadi koi vyakti naitik bal se prabhavit hokar koi aparaadh kare to vah kshamya nahin hoga

 His biography is often unavailable
 dow0 mataprasad ne inhen varanasi kaa nivasee bataaya he, parantu dow0 ramvilas sharma se lekar ramanika gupta tak inhen patna kaa nivasee hi maanate hai
 The only poem written by him is 'untouchable Complaint'
 yah kavita mahavir prasad dvivedi dwaara sampadit ‘saraswati’ main prakashit hui thi
 According to poet-critic Madan Kashyap, "however, being published in Saraswati is evidence that this poem was also given importance at that time
 phir bhi, samay rahete hindi sansar ne hira dom kii khoj khabar nahin lee
 Otherwise some of his other compositions, some more information about him - would have been in front of us
 " Dr
 Ramvilas Sharma has the credit for bringing Hira Dome and his poem 'untouchables Complaint' to the wider Hindi world after publication
 "1977 main prakashit apni pustak 'mahavir prasad dvivedi or hindi navajagaran' main dow0 ramvilas sharma ne is kavita ko uddhrut kiya
 It was only after that that attention of the people
 " Introducing this poem, Dr
 Sharma wrote that "in September 1914, the poem 'untouchables of the Untouchables' was published in the Saraswati of Patna, Hira Dome of Patna
 yah bhojpuri main he or sambhavtah us bhashaa main likhi hui yah ekmaatr kavita he jo dvivedi ji kii saraswati main prakashit hui thi
 This poem was sent to him because it is printed in brackets above the poem - 'received'
 hindi main isse pehle kisi dom-bandhu kii likhi kavita mere dekhne main nahin ai
 " aage puri kavita uddhrut karne ke baad dow0 sharma kii tippanee he ki "hira dom ne kisi se saraswati kaa naam suna hoga
 Like Maithilisharan Gupta, he may not have dreamed of becoming a famous poet by publishing poetry in Saraswati, but through Saraswati, he must send his complaint to educated people
 dvivedi ji ne sahaspurvak vah kavita apni us patrika main chhaapi jisamen bade-bade log rachanaayen chapaane ko tarasate the

 " madan kashyap ke anusaar "is kavita ko padhane se spasht ho jaataa he ki yah raat-din dukh bhogane vaale jan kii karunaa nahin takat kii abhivyakti he or iskaa sheershak 'achhut kii shikaayat' nishchit rup se sampadak athwa kisi anya vyakti kaa diya hua he
 Otherwise it should have been titled 'untouchables' Hunkar'
