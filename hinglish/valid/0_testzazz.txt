 The egg is long in one direction and has one end rounded and the other end slightly pointed

 In some castes, only females lay eggs, but in such a state the male raises food for it

 These weekly papers replaced "young India" and "navajivan" in a few days, whose publication was discontinued due to political reasons
 harijan prashn ke atirikt anya samayik vishyon par bhi gandhi ji in patron main lekh or tippaniyan likhaa karte the
 a few days later, at the request of Thakkar Bapa, untouchables, for the purpose, Gandhiji visited the whole of India

 According to Jain philosophy, the physical material is called Pudgal because it is a game of combination and separation of molecules
 buddha dharmadarshan main aatma ko pudgal kehete hai
 It is such a group of five wings - form, vedana, samskara, noun and science which becomes special in the state of nirvana
 pudgal shabd kii rachana do angon se hui hai
 Telepathy iskaa sanskrit evam paakrit main arth hai - "jo utpann hota hai or gal jaataa hai"
 Partially in English, Pudgal can be called Matter, but in Western science and Jain philosophy there are differences in the definition of atom, which makes Pudgal also dubious as Matter
 pudgal ke paanch gun hai - sparsh, darshan, ras, shravan or gandh
 Thus, pudgal can either be touched or seen or tasted or heard or can be smelled
 pudgal main in main se ek yaa ek se adhik gun ho sakate hai
 Pudgal's religion has to be formed and deteriorated, so it is impossible to completely destroy Pudgal
 pudgal keval ek rup se duusare rup main parivartit ho saktaa hai
 With the combination of soul and spirit, the world is moving
 jain darshan ke anusaar, pudgal ek ajeev tatv hai
 He is devoid of consciousness
 jab tak aatma pudgal se lipt hai, tab tak vah sansar ke janm-maran ke dwandv main bandhi hui hai
 Only when you are indulged with Pudgal, liberation of the soul is possible

 For example, in the rare case of the portrayal of the Trinity as three identical individuals, the Holy Spirit represents the male, in the style of depictions of the father and son
 kuch isai samooh hai, jo yah sikhaate he ki pavitra aatma stri he, yaa iskaa swaroop stri kaa he
 In the original languages of the Bible, where the Holy Spirit refers, they are mostly based on the gender of verbs
 hebrew main aatma ) ke liye shabd streeling he
 In Greek) the word is cleveling, and Aramaic, the language in which it is commonly believed that Jesus spoke, is feminine
 zyaadaatar bhashavidon dwaara aisa nahin mana gaya he ki vyakti ke ling kaa uske naam ke saath koi mahatv he
 In biblical cases where the proper pronoun is used for the pronoun of the Holy Spirit and the opposite gender for the soul
 syrian bhashaa, jiskaa prayog aamtaur par isa purv 300 saal pehle hota tha, kii utpatti arami se hui he
 In the Syrian language document given by the old Miafisite Church, the feminine of the word soul indicates the rise of theology, in which the Holy Spirit is considered feminine

 Some other independent liberators with similar learning are parties to Judaism and some scholars associated with other "mainstream" sects, while these sects do not necessarily assert themselves, having feminine interpreters of the third member of the divinity
 Is a writing job
 unity girjaghar ke sah-sansthaapak charles philmore kaa maananaa he ki pavitra spashtatya parameshwar ke swaroop kaa streeling he, isiilie "jehova kaa pyaar" or "prem hameshaa streeling he" aisa mana jaataa he
 Gender is seen as an "essential feature of eternal identity and purpose" in the Church of Latter-day Saints

 krishi main hari khaad us sahaayak fasal ko kehete hai jisaki kheti mukhyat: bhoomi main poshak tattvon ko badhaane tathaa usamen jaivik padaathon kii purti karne ke uddeshy se kii jaati he
 Often, such a crop is mixed in the soil by running the plow in its green condition
 hari khaad se bhoomi kii upjau shakti badhati he or bhoomi kii raksha hoti he
 With the continuous exploitation of the soil, the essential elements for the growth of the plant present in it are being destroyed
 inaki kshatipurti hetu va mitti kii upjau shakti ko banaaye rakhane ke liye hari khaad ek uttam vikalp he
 When a green plant is not pressed into the field to increase the amount of soil nitrogen or bacteria, this process is called giving green manure
 hari khaad ke upyog se na sirf natrajan bhoomi main uplabdh hota he balki mrudaa kii bhautik, rasinic evam jaivik dasha main bhi sudhaar hota he
 The problem of environment and land pollution can be eliminated, by reducing the cost, the economic condition of the farmers is better, the soil is supplied with micro elements and the fertility of soil also gets better
 1
 hari khaad keval natrajan va carbonic padaarthon kaa hi saadhan nahin he balki isse mitti main kai anya aavashyak poshak tatva bhi prachur maatra main uplabdh hote hai
 2
 Use of green manure also reduces soil brittleness, good air circulation, increase in water holding capacity, improve acidification / alkalinity and decrease soil erosion
 3
 hari khaad ke prayog se mrudaa main sookshmjivon kii sankhya evam kriyasheeltaa badhati he tathaa mrudaa kii urvara shakti evam utpaadan kshamta bhi badhati he
 4
 Green manure also reduces soil diseases
 5
 iske prayog se rasaynic urvarkon main kami karke bhi tikaoo kheti kar sakate hai
 For green manure, pulses can be used for crops like sanai, dhaincha, cowpea, urad, moong, guar etc
 in fasalon kii vruddhi sheeghra, kam samay main ho jaati he, pattiyaan badi vajandaar evam bahut sankhya main rahati he, evam inaki urvarak tathaa jal kii aavashyaktaa kam hoti he, jisase kam laagat main adhik carbonic padaarth praapt ho jaataa he
 In pulses crops, bacteria are found in roots to stabilize nitrogen in the soil
 adhik varsha vaale sthanon main jahaan jal paryaapt maatra main uplabdh ho sanai kaa upyog karen, dhaincha ko sookhe kii dasha vaale sthanon main tathaa samasyagrast bhoomi main jaise kshareey dasha main upyog karen
 Guar should be planted in sandy, less fertile soil in places with less rainfall
 lobia ko achche jal nikaas vaali kshareey mrudaa main tathaa mung, urad ko kharif yaa greeshm kaal main aise bhoomi main le jahaan jal bharaav na hota ho
 With this, good yield of their beans is obtained and the remaining plant can be used as green manure
 hari khaad ke mukhya chaar gun hai- In low fertile problematic soil, these crops should be 20 to 25 kg in pulses for good growth in a short time
 Nitrogen per hectare and 40 to 50 kg in non-pulse crops
 Pouring at the rate of nitrogen per hectare is very beneficial
 in fasalon ko parati avasthaa main uchit nami ke samay beej ko chhidakar bo diya jaataa he evam ek jutai mitti palatney vaale hal se karke pata chalaa diya jaataa he
 a small amount of 40 to 50 kg in the soil
 Phosphorus per hectare and 20-25 kg
 Adding a quantity of potash per hectare helps in quick completion of rotting
 hari khaad kii fasal ko buaai ke din se 40 se 60 din kii avasthaa main pata lagaakar mitti palatney vaale hal se 15 se 20 semi kii gaharaai par palat dena chahie
 Premature reversal does not yield enough organic matter and late reversal takes longer time due to excess fiber
 atah achit samay par palatnaa laabhadaayak hota he
 In the case of excess rainfall and excess temperature, the process of rotting and decomposition starts soon
 dhaincha yaa sanai kii fasal ko hari khaad ke rup main palatney ke baad pani bharkar dhan kii ropai kii ja sakati he
