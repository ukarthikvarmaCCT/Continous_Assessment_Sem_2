 It may seem strange that there is a hierarchy for foods, but this is because there is a dual opposition between pure and impure gods which is the hierarchal of the two gods who have this dual opposition
 
 ve vishnu or shiv hai
 Loh's Luzzi explains that while Vishnu is seen as 'the offerings that are given to Shiva are more frugal'
 shiv ke liye ek bhent karne ke liye koi namak yaa anya toppings ke saath sade chaaval hone kii sambhaavna he, jabaki vishnu ko ek bhent ke ek dakshin bhartiya pakwaan jo anya said dish ke saath chaaval se milakar kar sakate hai jaise lagate ho saktaa he

 Since ancient times, followers of different religions and beliefs have lived in India

 The name of Shiromani Raidas is foregone in such saints

 In his memory, Magh Purna is celebrated as Ravidas Jayanti

 His ancestral business was shoe-making, and he happily embraced it
 ve apana kaam puri lagan tathaa parishram se karte the or samay se kaam ko puraa karne par bahut dhyaan dete the
 People who came in contact with him due to his timeliness and sweet behavior were also very happy

 He used to get special pleasure in helping saints and saints
 ve unhen praaia: mulya liye bina juute bhent kar diya karte the
 His parents were unhappy with him because of his nature
 kuch samay baad unhone ravidaas tathaa unki patni ko apane ghar se bhaga diya
 Ravidas ji used to work his business in the neighborhood by making a separate building for himself and used to spend the rest of the time in ishvara-bhajan and satsang of saints and saints
 unke jivan kii choti-choti ghatnaon se samay tathaa vachan ke paalan sambandhi unke gunon kaa pataa chalata he
 Once, on the occasion of a festival, the people of the neighborhood were going for a Ganga-bath

 If i could not give him the shoes today, the promise would break
 ganga snaan ke liye jane par man yahan laga rahegaa to punya kaise praapt hoga ? man jo kaam karne ke liye ant:karan se taiyaar ho vahi kaam karnaa uchit he
 If the mind is right, then it can attain the virtue of Gangesanan only in the waters of Kahouta
 kaha jaataa he ki is prakaar ke vyavhaar ke baad se hi kahawat prachlit ho gayi ki - man changa to kathoti main ganga
 Raidas termed the controversy in the name of high and low spirit and devotion to God as meaningless and meaningless and exhorted everyone to live together in a loving manner

 apane ek bhajan main unhone kaha he- Say, Raidas is your distance, part is so beautiful

 Their thoughts mean that devotion to God comes from great fortune

 Similarly, a man who behaves politely after abandoning the feeling of pride and nobility can be a devotee of God
 raidas kii vaani bhakthi kii sachhee bhaavana, samaaj ke vyapak hit kii kaamana tathaa maanav prem se ot-prot hoti thi
 Therefore, it had a profound effect on the minds of the listeners

 Although the princely state of Sao Sao was simply named 'wei' in 213 AD, but historians often add the family name of 'sao' to it to distinguish it from many other states called Wei in Chinese history
 Wei says

 shithilataa ek aisa vyavhaar he jise kinhin kriyaaon yaa kaaryon ko parvarti samay ke liye sthagan dwaara parilakshyit kiya jaataa he
 Psychologists often cite procrastination as a mechanism of coping with anxiety associated with the beginning or ending of an action or decision
 manovigyaan ke shodhakarta bhi shithilataa ko vargeekrut karne ke liye teen mandandon kaa upyog karte hai
 In order to classify any behavior as procrastination, it is extremely important to be productive, non-productive and delaying
 shithilataa ke parinamswaroop kisi bhi vyakti ko apni jimmedaariyon yaa vaadon ko puraa nahin kar paane kii sthiti main tanaav, aparaadh bodh, vyaktigat utpaadakta kii haani, sankat kii sristi or anya vyaktiyon kii asahmati kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 These combined emotions may further encourage procrastination
 haalanki logon ke liye kuch had tak shithilataa dikhalaanaa saamaanya he, lekin yah us samay ek samasya kaa rup dhaaran kar letaa he jab yah saamaanya kriyakalapon main baadha utpann karne lagata he
 Chronic procrastination may be a sign of an underlying psychological disorder
 yah shabd swayan latin shabd procrostinetus : pro- or crostinetus se aayaa he
 The first known presence of this noun was in Edward Hall's The Union of the Noble and Illustrious Families of Lancaster and York, often published before 1548
 dharmopadesh main shithilataa ko kaary karne main taalamatol yaa vilamb, ulanghan yaa anichhaa or paap mana gaya he
 There are huge differences in the psychological causes of procrastination, but usually it includes a concern, a low sense of self-worth and a self-defeating mentality
 It is believed that procrastinators also have less interpersonal than normal levels, which are more often based on "dreams and desires" of perfection or achievement than on the real appreciation of their compulsion and potential
 lekhak david alan kaary or jivan main shithilataa ke do pramukh manovaigyanik kaarnon kii charchaa karte hai jo chintaa se sambandhit he, na ki aalasy se
 pehali shrenee main aisi baaten shaamil hai jo itani choti hai ki unke liye chintit hone kii aavashyaktaa nahin hai, aise kaary jo chizon ke pravaah main rukaawat daalate hai or bahut kam prabhaav vaale kaamkaaj se jude hai, jiskaa ek udhaaharan he gande kamare ko thik karnaa
 The second category includes things that are so large that they are difficult to control, actions that a person may fear or which are expected to have a major impact on a person's life; An example of this may be that adult children of an aging mother or father have to decide which system is best for their living or a student who is taking an important test for their studies
 yadi shithilataa ek aadat ban jaati he to vyakti anjaane main kisi kaary ke mahatva kaa adhimulyankan yaa nimnamoolyankan kar saktaa he
 From the point of view of behavioral psychology, James Mazur has stated that procrastination is a particular subject of "longing" against self-control
 maazur kehete he ki shithilataa kisi dandadaata ke ek asthaayee chhot ke kaaran hoti he, kyonki yah kisi sudrikkarta ke liye asthaayee chhot ke saath hoti he
 As Mazur states, procrastination occurs when one has to choose between a later major task and an earlier smaller task; Because the infinite value of that work is discounted by time, a subject that chooses the latter larger task
 jon peri kehete hai ki shithilataa "kisi kaary ko adhik mahatvapurn dhang se nahin karne kaa ek tarika" he, ek aisa vivaran jiskaa upyog kisi anya kathin, samyaanusaar or mahatvapurn kaaryon main kiya ja saktaa he, kuch aisa kaary jo vah is pravishti ke lekhan main kar rahe the main prifrantal lob kii bhoomika ke samaan he jahaan antar-sakriyan ek aam baat he
 Procrastination can cause a persistent and debilitating disorder in some people, causing significant mental disabilities and dysfunction
 ye log vastav main avsaad yaa ADHD jaisi kisi antarnihit maansik swasthya samasya se peedit ho sakate hai
 Although dysfunction is a behavioral condition, these underlying mental health disorders can still be cured with the help of medication and / or therapy
 rogopchaar kisi vyakti ko nae vyavhaar seekhney, dar or chintaa par kaabo paane tathaa jivan kii ek unnat gunvattta ko praapt karne main madad karne vaala ek upyogi saadhan ho saktaa he
 In this way, it is necessary that those who are struggling with debilitating procrastination go to meet a trained therapist or psychiatrist and find out the presence of underlying mental health issues
 jo log shithilataa or kam aaveg niyantran kaa pradarshan karte hai, ve internet aasakti ke icchhuk lagate hai
 Traditionally, procrastination has been associated with perfectionism, which tends to be negatively judged and deflected in its own performance, excessive fear and evaluation of its abilities by others, excessive social self-consciousness and anxiety, recurrent retarded mind and functioning
 There is a tendency to evaluate
 slene ne dekha ki aparipurnataavaadiyon kii tulana main anukulit paripurnataavaadiyon main kam shithilataa thi, jabaki ku-anukulit paripurnataavaadiyon main ucch stareey shithilataa thi
 Although academic procrastination is not a particular type of procrastination, it is believed that procrastination is particularly prevalent in an academic setting where students are charged for their time and attention in an environment full of events and activities, workloads and deadlines for examinations It is necessary to reach
 or adhik vishesh rup se, 1992 main kiye gaye ek adhyayan se sabit ho gaya he ki "survekshit chaatro main se 52% chaatro main sambandhit shithilataa kii madad ke liye atyadhik aavashyaktaa ke liye sanyat hone kaa sanket mila"
 aisa moolyankan kiya gaya he ki 80%-95% college chaatro main shithilataa paayi jaati he jabaki unamem se lagbhag 75% khud ko shithilak samajhate hai
 One source of procrastination is to underestimate the time required to analyze research
 kai chaatr ek vishay-patr ke shodh main kai saptaah samarpit kar dete hai, lekin phir bhi ise likhane ke kaam ko samaapt karne main asamarth ho jate hai kyonki us vishay par apane khud ke pariprekshya ko pesh karne se pehle unhen kai pratikul vichaaron kii samiksha kerani padati hai
 They struggle to present their own analysis despite being aware of the opinions of resources
 chaatr sanglakshan ek aisi ghatana ko suchit karata he jisamen kai chaatr thik samay-seemaa se pehle sirf ek kaary main apane aap ko puri tarah se lagaana shuru kar denge
 This leads to wastage of any resistor that is established in the individual work period assessment
 siddhant ko ajail software deveopment main bhi sambodhit kiya gaya he
 Sluggish types of procrastinators tend to view their responsibilities in a negative way and avoid using them in other tasks
 udhaahranswaroop, apane vidhyalay ke kaary ko tyaag dena sust prakaar ke shithilataaparak bacchon ke liye ek aam baat he, lekin apane saamaajik jivan ko nahin
 Students often see projects as a whole rather than breaking them into smaller parts
 is prakaar kii shithilataa inkaar yaa avagun kaa ek rup he; isliye aam taur par kisi madad kii maang nahin kii ja rahi he
 In addition, they are also unable to postpone gratification
 shithilak un sthitiyon ko taalte rahete hai jo aprasannataa kaa kaaran hota he
 Instead they engage in more enjoyable activities
 freudian sangyaaon main, aise shithilak, vaastaviktaa ke siddhant ko nyochaavar karne ke bajaay anand ke siddhant ko tyaagane se inkaar karte hai
 They do not seem concerned about work and deadlines, rather it is just an excuse for work that needs to be completed
 pareshaan-bhaybheet prakaar ke shithilak saadharantah dabaav se abhibhoot, samay ke prati avastavik, lakshyon ke prati anishchit or kai anya nakaaratmak bhaawanaaon ko mahasoos karte hai
 They may feel a sense of malaise
 jab unhen aisa lagata he ki unamem apane kaam ko safaltaapurvak puraa karne ke liye aavashyak kshamta yaa dhyaan kii kami hai to ve apane aap se yahi kehete hai ki unhen ab nishcint hokar aaraam karne kii aavashyaktaa hai, udhaahranswaroop, aaj isaki chintaa nahin karke subah main ise nae sire se shuru karnaa hi behatar he
 Generally they have showy schemes that are not real
 unke 'aaraam' praayah asthaayee va aprabhavi hote hai, tathaa samay nikal jane evam samay-seemaa nikat aane par unhen or adhik tanaav hone lagata hai or vyakti uttarottar apradhi evam ashankawan lagane lagata he
 This behavior becomes a cycle of failure and delay as plans and goals are repeatedly postponed into the diary for the next day or week
 yah unke vyaktigat jivan or sambandhon par ek gambhir prabhaav daal saktaa he
 Since they are uncertain of their goals, they are often awkward with people who seem confident and goal-oriented, which may lead them to depression
 pareshaan-bhaybheet shithilak praayah apane ghanishtha mitron ke saath bhi apane sampark ko najrandaz karte hue saamaajik jivan se munh pher lete hai
 According to Dr
 Linda Sapodin's It's About Time, there are six types of dysfunction that can be found in a person either singly or jointly
 ye sheliyaan hai - paripurnataavaadi, sankat-nirmaataa, swapndrashtaa, avhelak, chintaa-karta or ati-karta
 prayek sheershak swa-vyaakhyaatmak he jabaki prayek kaa prayek prakaar par kaabo paane kaa ek anokhaa tarika he
 Severe misconceptions and stigma of reaching the climax of procrastination often cause a lot of difficulty for procrastinators seeking help or finding a sensible source of support
 manovaigyanikon ko gyaat lakshanon main se ek lakshan kaary-vimukhipan he jiskaa maatr aalasy, ichha-shakti ke abhaav yaa mahatvakanksha main kami ke rup main praayah galat parilakshan kiya jaataa he
 Another stigma is that procrastinators are lazy and / or stupid
 yah bhi koi vishesh vishay nahin he kyonki adhiktar vaastavik rup se purnataya honhaar yaa budhimaan hote hai

 The creations of Buddhists and Nathpanthis are liberating and just religious, but many of the Jains are also related to the common sensations of life

 are spreading in public
 the, shastragyansampann varg main bhi roodhiyon or aadambar kii pradhanta ho chali thi
 Due to the influence of Mayanism, feelings of public opinion and inaction were beginning to flourish in the society
 aise samay main bhaktiandolan ke rup main aisa bharatvyaapee vishaal saanskrithik andolan uthaa jisane samaaj main uthkarshvidhayak saamaajik or vaiyaktik mulyon kii pratishtha kii
 The Bhakti movement began around the tenth century by the Alwar saints of the south
 vahaan shankaracharya ke advaitamat or mayawad ke virodh main chaar vaishnav sampradaay khadey hue
 These four sects propagated the incarnations of Vishnu in North India
 inamen se ek ke pravartak ramanujacharya the, jinaki shishyparampara main aanevaale ramanand ne uttar bharat main rambhakti kaa prachaar kiya
 Ramananda's Rama was a replacement for Brahma who incarnated in the world to destroy the demons and expand his pastimes
 bhakthi ke kshetra main ramanand ne oonchnich kaa bhedbhaav mitaane par vishesh bal diya
 He influenced two devotees - Kabir and Tulsi, who believed in the two forms of Ram's virtue and nirguna
 vishnuswami ke shuddhadvait mat kaa aadhaar lekar isi samay vallabhacharya ne apana pushtimaarg chalaaya
 From the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries a number of cults were established throughout the country on the basis of Puranasamat Krishnanacharitra, the most influential of which was the confirmation of Vallabh
 unhone shankar mat ke viruddh brahm ke sagun rup ko hi vaastavik kaha
 According to his opinion, this world is not a spread of falsehood or maya, but is a spread of Brahma, so it is true
 unhone krishna ko brahm kaa avatar mana or uski prapti ke liye bhakt kaa purna aatmasamarpan aavashyak batalaaya
 Devotion can be attained only by the grace or affirmation of God
 is sampradaay main upasna ke liye gopisenvallabh, lilapurushottam krishna kaa madhur rup sweekrut hua
 Thus in northern India, Vishnu's Rama and Krishna avatars became prominent
 is prakaar in vibhinn maton kaa aadhaar lekar hindi main nirgun or sagun ke naam se bhakthikavy kii do shakhaayen saath saath chalin
 There are two subdivisions of Nirgunamat - Gyanashrayi and Premashrayi
 pehle ke pratinidhi kabir or duusare ke jaaysi hai
 Sagunmat also flowed into two sub-sections - Rambhakti and Krishnabhakti
 pehle ke pratinidhi tulsi hai or duusare ke surdaas
 Kabir, the principal poet of the Jnanasrayi branch, has a combined influence of various religious trends and philosophical beliefs
 unki rachanaaon main dharmasudharak or samajasudharak kaa rup vishesh prakhar he
 He stressed the correctness of conduct
 bahyadambar, roodhiyon or andhvishwaason par unhone teevr kashaghat kiya
 By proclaiming the ability of humans, he aroused a sense of self-respect among the people of the lower class
 is shakha ke anya kavi raidas, dadu hai
 The most prominent poet of Premashrayi Dhara is Jayasi, whose "padmavat" has been specially praised for its poignant lovemaking, Katharas and natural art
 inaki anya rachanaaon main "akharavat' or "aakhri kalam' aadi hai, jinamein sufi sampradaaysangat baaten hai
 Other poets of this stream are Qutuban, Manjhan, Usman, Sheikh Nabi and Noor Muhammad etc
 aaj kii drushti se is sampurna bhakthikavy kaa mahatv uski dharmikata se adhik lokajeevanagat maanviya anubhutiyon or bhaavon ke kaaran he
 With this thought, devotees can be called the golden age of Hindi poetry

 ke aas paas hindi kavita main ek nayaa mode aayaa
 This was particularly stimulated by the immediate court culture and Sanskritic literature
 sanskrit sahityashastra ke katipay anshon ne use shastreey anushaasan kii ore pravrutt kiya
 In Hindi, the word 'riti' or 'poetry' was used for poetry
 isliye kavyashastrabaddh saamaanya srujanpravriti or ras, alankaar aadi ke nirupak bahusankhyak lakshangranthon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue is samay ke kavy ko 'reetikavy' kaha gaya
 The clearest signs of the old tradition of the poetic trends of this poetry are found in the adhikavya of Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhransh, Persian and Hindi and the sringari tendencies of Krishnakavya
 reetikavy rachana kaa aarambh ek sanskritgya ne kiya
 These were Acharya Keshavdas, whose famous compositions are Kavipriya, Rasikapriya and Ramachandrika
 keshav ke kai dashak baad chintamani se lekar atharahavin sadi tak hindi main reetikavy kaa ajasr strot pravaahit hua jisamen nar-nari-jivan ke romantic pakshon or tatsambandhi saras samvednaaon kii atyant kalatmak abhivyakti vyapak rup main hui
 The poets of Reetikal lived in the shelter of kings and nobles
 vahaan manoranjan or kalavilas kaa vaataavaran swaabhaavik tha
 The main means of intellectual enjoyment was considered idiomatic there
 aise vaataavaran main likhaa gaya sahitya adhiktar shringarmulak or kalavaichitraya se yukt tha
 But at the same time, there were also independent singers of Prem who have touched the depths of love
 maatra or kavyagun donon hi drushtiyon se is samay kaa nar-nari-prem or saundarya kii maarmik vyanjana karanevaala kavyasahitya mahatvapurn he
 Ritikavya is primarily a poetry of fleshy makeup
 isamen nar-narijivan ke smaraneey pakshon kaa sundar udghaatan hua he
 The more poetic is in the Muktak style, but there are also the Manavakyas
 in do sau varshon main shringaarakavy kaa apurv utkarsh hua
 But slowly the rituals grew and the poetry of Hindi poetry became narrow
 aadhunik yug tak aate aate in donon kamiyon kii ore sahityakaron kaa dhyaan vishesh rup se aakrisht hua
 See also - yah aadhunik yug kaa aarambh kaal he jab bharatiyon kaa europea samskruti se sampark hua
 In the work of establishing its roots in India, the British rule influenced and agitated Indian life at various levels
 nai paristhitiyon ke dhakke se sthitisheel jivanavidhi kaa dhaanchaa tuutane laga
 a new era of consciousness began
 sangharsh or saamanjasy ke nae aayam saamne aae
 The highest possibilities of New Age literature were rooted in Khadi Boli prose, so it is also called prose-era
 hindi kaa pracheen gadhy rajasthani, maithili or brajabhasha main miltaa he par vah sahitya kaa vyapak madhyam banane main ashakt tha
 The tradition of Khadiboli is ancient
 amir khusro se lekar madhyakaalin bhushan tak ke kavy main iske udhaaharan bikhare pade hai
 Old samples of Khadi Boli prose have also been found
 is tarah kaa bahut sa gadhy farsi or gurumukhi lipi main likhaa gaya he
 It developed in the name of "dakshini" in the Muslim principalities of the South
 atharahavin sadi main likhaa gaya ramprasad niranjani or daulataraam kaa gadhy uplabdh he
 But the Hindi prologue prose of Hindi as a conductor of the new era was widely spread since the nineteenth century
 kalkatte ke fort wiliam kalege main, navaagat angarej afasaron ke upyog ke liye, lallu laal tathaa sadal mishra ne gadhy kii pustaken likhakar hindi ke khadi boli gadhy kii purvaparampara ke vikaas main kuch sahaayta di
 The prose compositions of Munshi Sadasukhlal and Insha Alla Khan were written at this time
 aage chalakar press, patrapatrikaon, isai dharmprachaarkon tathaa naveen shiksha sansthaaon se hindi gadhy ke vikaas main sahaayta mili
 Residents of various provinces like Bengal, Punjab, Gujarat etc
 also contributed to its growth and spread
 hindi kaa pehla samachaarpatr "udant maartand' 1826 i
 main kalkatte se prakashit hua
 King Shivprasad and Raja Laxman Singh were instrumental in the creation and propagation of Hindi prose in their own way
 aryasamaj or anya saanskrithik andolanon ne bhi aadhunik gadhy ko aage badhaayaa
 The evolving tradition of prose literature began from the late nineteenth century
 iske pravartak aadhunik yug ke pravartak or pathpradarshak bhaaratendu harishchandra the jinhone sahitya kaa samakaleen jivan se ghanishtha sambandh sthapit kiya
 This was the era of solstice and renaissance
 angarejon kii kootnithik chaalon or aarthik shoshan se janata santrast or kshubdh thi
 While one section of the society was beset by Western rites, the other class was stuck in stereotypes
 isi samay nai shiksha kaa aarambh hua or saamaajik sudhaar ke andolan chale
 With the influence of new knowledge science, a new attitude towards life developed among the newly educated who was specially oriented towards present and future rather than past
 saamaajik vikaas main utpann aasthaa or jaagrath samudayachetana ne bharatiyon main jivan ke prati nayaa utsaah utpann kiya
 Contemporary literature of Bharatendu, especially in prose literature, gave a clear and live expression of the various stages of the then ideological and physical environment
 is yug kii naveen rachanaayen deshbhakti or samajasudhar kii bhaavana se paripurna hai
 The tendency of political and social satire also emerged due to the clash of many new situations
 is samay ke gadhy main bolchaal kii sajivta he
 Due to the personality of the writers, it has added enough interestingness to it
 sabase adhik niabandh likhe gaye jo vyaktipradhan or vichaarpradhan tathaa varnanaatmak bhi the
 Storytelling was also written in many genres, mostly educative
 par yathartwaadee drushti or nae shilp kii vishistataa shrinivas das ke "parikshaguru' main hi he
 [[devakinandan Khatri's Tilasmi novel 'chandrakanta' was published at this time

 Bharatendu, Pratapnarayan Mishra, Srinivasa Das, etc
 are prominent playwrights
 saath hi bhakthi or shringaar kii bahut si saras kavitaayen bhi nirmit hui
 But the poems in which social sentiments were expressed give an initial impression of the creativity of the new era
 khadi boli ke chhitroot prayogon ko chhod shesh kavitaayen brajabhasha main likhi gayin
 In fact, the new era was more rewarded in prose of this time
 is kalavadhi kii sabase mahatvapurn ghatnaayen do hai - ek to saamaanya kavyabhasha ke rup main khadi boli kii sweekruti or duusare hindi gadhy kaa niyaman or parimarjan
 The most powerful yoga in this work was that of Saraswati editor Mahavirprasad Dwivedi
 dvivedi ji or unke sahakarmiyon ne hindi gadhy kii abhivyaktikshmata ko viksit kiya
 In addition to Dwivedi in the field of essays, one to one careful, vigorous and lively prose stylists such as Balmukund, Chandradhar Sharma Guleri, Purnasingh, Padmasinh Sharma emerged
 upanyaas anek likhe gaye par uski yathartwaadee parampara kaa ullekhneey vikaas na ho sakaa
 Realistic modern stories were born and developed during this period
 guleri, kowshik aadi ke atirikt premchand or prasad kii bhi aarambhik kahaniyaan isi samay prakaash main ai
 The area of the drama was definitely deserted
 is samay ke sabase prabhaavshaalee sameekshak dvivedi ji the jinaki sanshodhanavaadee or maryaadanishth aalochana ne anek samakaleen sahitya ko paryaapt prabhavit kiya
 Mishrabandhu, Krishnabihari Mishra and Padmasinh Sharma are the other reviewers at this time, but overall the review of this period has been outwardly dominant
 sudhaarwadi aadarshon se prerit ayodhyasingh upaadhyaay ne apane "priypravas' main radha kaa loksevika rup prastut kiya or khadiboli ke vibhinn roopon ke prayog main nipunata bhi pradarshit kii
 Maithilisharan Gupta raised the voice of nationalism and social reform in "bharat Bharti" and revered Urmila in "saket"
 is samay ke anya kavi dvivedi ji, shridhar pathak, balmukund gupt, nathuram sharma 'shankar', gaya prasad shukla 'sanehi' aadi hai
 The representatives of Brajbhasha poetic tradition are Ratnakar and Satyanarayana Kaviratna
 is samay khadi boli kavyabhasha ke parimarjan or samayik parivesh ke anuroop rachana kaa kaary sampann hua
 Much of the new poetry is thoughtful and descriptive
 san 1920-40 ke do dashakon main aadhunik sahitya ke antargat vaicharik or kalatmak pravritiyon kaa anek rup utkarsh dikhaai padaa
 Novel and story received the highest popularity

 The sense of social contrast and class struggle became particularly vocal in this
 isane sahitya ko saamaajik kranti ke astr ke rup main grahan kiya
 Progressive literature, especially poetry, did not have much potential for artistic flourish due to the limitations of its utilitarian vision, yet it awakened a new consciousness by emphasizing the social side of literature
 pragativaadee andolan ke aarambh ke kuch hi baad nae manovigyaan yaa manovishleshanshastra se prabhavit ek or vyaktivaadee pravriti sahitya ke kshetra main sakriy hui thi jise san 1943 ke baad prayogwaad naam diya gaya
 The modified form of this is the present day new poetry and new stories
