 The main reason for adopting this kind of administrative policy was given by the government, the huge administrative inconveniences, and geographical difficulties in governance under the same central system of two divided and separate geographical zones of the Pakistani dominion
 atah is bhugolic va prashasnic vishay ke samaadhaan ke rup main, sarkaar ne in do bhugoleey hisson ko hi, ek mahasangheey dhaanche ke antargat, pakistan ke do vaahid prashasnic ikaayiyon ke rup main sthapit karne kii niti banaai gai
 According to the situation in the eastern part of the erstwhile mumlikat-e-pakistan, under Iske, the five provinces of the western part and their provincial governments were disbanded and a province, West Pakistan, was formed, while the eastern part was called East Pakistan
 Was formed
 tatprakaar, pakistan, ek ikai yojana ke tahat, mahaj do praanton main vibhajit ek rajya ban gaya
 The One Unit Plan was announced on 22 November 1954 during the reign of Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra, and on 14 October 1955, the province of West Pakistan was formed, unifying all the provinces of the western part of the country, including all the provinces except the erstwhile , Royalty and tribal areas were also included
 is praant main 12 pramandal the, or isaki rajdhani lahore thi
 On the other hand, the province of East Bengal was named East Pakistan, with its capital at Dhaka
 sangheey rajdhani ko varsh 1959 main karanchi se rawalpindi sthanantarit kiya gaya, jahaan sena mukhyalay tha, or nai rajdhani, islamabad ke puraa hone tak yahaan maujuud rahaa jabaki sangheey vidhanpalika ko dhaka main sthapit kiya gaya
 The aim of this policy was to bring about clear administrative reforms but in many respects it was a very destructive step
 pashchimi pakistan main maujuud bahut sari rajyon ne is aashwaasan par vibhaajan ke samay pakistan main shaamil ho gaye the ki unki swaittata kaayam rakhi jaaegi lekin van ikai bana dene ke faisle se sabhi sthaneey rajyon kaa ant ho gaya
 The states of Bahawalpur, Kheripore and Kalat are particularly notable in this regard
 maamle is samay adhik gambhir samay 1958 i
 The post of Chief Minister was abolished after the overthrow of the President and the President retained the options of West Pakistan
 raajnneetik visheshgyon yah bhi samajhate hai ki pashchimi pakistan ke sabhi praanton ko ekajute karne ke uddeshy purvi pakistan kii bhashaai or raajnneetik ikai kaa jor todna tha
 Finally on 1 July 1970, President Yahya Khan wiped out a unit and restored all the provinces of West Pakistan
 pakistan kii sthapana pakistan andolan kaa parinaam tha, jise mohammad ali jinnah ke netritv main, tathakthith rup se, bharatiya upmahadweep ke musalmaan aabaadi ke liye kiya gaya tha
 With the passage of the Indian Independence Act in 1947, Pakistan was established after the partition of India
 is vibhaajan ke tahat british bharat ke purvi va pashchimi chhoron par muslim bahul ilaakon ko pakistan main shaamil kar diya gaya
 Also under this division, the Punjab and Bengal provinces of British India were also divided and East Bengal and West Punjab were merged into Pakistan
 iske bhushetra main british-shasit bharat ke paanch praant the: purvi bengal, pashchimi punjab, baluchistan, sindh or uttar-pashchim seemaant praant
 a governor was appointed by the Governor of Pakistan to oversee the governance of every province
 saath hi kuch riyasaton ne bhi pakistani sandh main shaamil hone kaa prastaav sweekaar kiya tha
 These princely states were: Bhawalpur princely state, Khairpur, Swat, Dir, Hunza, Chitral, Makran and Kalat
 kukhyat evam vivaadaat redcliff rekha vah rekha thi jise bharat ganraajya va islamic ganraajya pakistan ke bich kii antarrashtriya seemaa ke rup main donon pakshon dwaara mana gaya tha
 This line passed through the border of Gujarat and Rajasthan in the west and dividing Punjab
 purv main yah rekha bengal ko vibhajit karti thi
 After partition, lakhs of people had migrated across this line in the name of religion
 haalaanki, pakistan kii kalpana, mohammad iqbaal ne 1930 main bharat ke uttar pashchim ke chaar praanton or qabaili ilaakon ke mail se kii thi, dhire-dhire, muslim lig kii ye raajnneeti badhati gai or bharat ke kai muslim bahul kshetron main use samarthan mila
 In the election of 1946, the Muslim League also gained majority in East Bengal, and with this it became clear that East Bengal would also be included in Pakistan
 pakistan kii sthapana pakistan andolan kaa sidhaa parinaam tha, jiske rahanuma mohammad ali jinnah the
 Subsequently, as there was no constitution in that country, Pakistan was governed under the Government of India Act of 1935
 vibhaajan va pakistan kii sthapana ke pashchaat vyavasthapika ko pakistan ke do pruthak bhaagon ko, jo kareeb hajaar mile kii bhartiya bhoomi se alag-thalag the, ko ek hi jagah se, prashasit karne main khaasi asuvidha kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa tha
 In addition, the western part itself was divided into four provinces, tribal areas and various princely states, while the eastern part was a province
 iske alaava, purvi bhaag main pashchimi bhaag ke mukaable, vyavastha, naukarshahi va sainya suraksha kii ati nishparyapti thi
 And, the western part was comparatively more developed and had a large army and sufficient bureaucracy and administration
 atah purvi bhaag, jo pashchim ke hi tulanaatmak jansankhya rakhata tha, ke liye vikaas va sampannataa kaa rasta kathin evam pashchim ke mukaable asamya tha
 In such a situation, apart from language and cultural issues in the mind of the eastern side, there were serious questions about the sharing of powers and facilities and the issue of strategic and economic equality
 is bhugolic sthiti se upji prashasnic va asamanta kii kathinaayee, va aarthik noummidi ke samaadhaan ke liye is ek ikai vyavastha kaa masauda taiyaar kiya gaya, jiske tahat donon hison main keval ek hi praant hoga, atah donon ko baraabar kii raajnneetik shakti praapt hogi
 Also, other development policies were also included in this plan
 pradhanmantri choudhary mohammad ali ne 14 oktob 1955 ko, 30 sitambar 1955 me pakistan kii rashtriya sabha main paarit, pashchimi pakistan ke sabhi praanton ko mila dene ke adhinium ko karyanvit kar, van unit system ko lagu kar diya
 Earlier, it was officially announced on 22 November 1954 by Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra
 iskundar mirza dwaara is yojana ko apnaane ke liye sadan ko yah kaaran pesh kiye gaye the: But the establishment of this single unit was not an easy task, as it faced opposition from many factions, especially the provincial governments
 sindh vidhansabha ne praanton ke sammilan se ek praant banane ke upaay ke virodh main vot kiya tha, jiske baad sindh ke tatkaaleen mukhyamantri peerzada abdul sattar ko ghulaam mohammad dwaara nilambit kar diya gaya tha
 Furthermore, East Bengal itself objected to the scheme, as it feared demographic changes from it
 baharhaal, in sari rukaawaton ke hal ke pashchaat antytah is ek ikai yojana ko lagu kar diya gaya
 Under this, the province of West Pakistan was formed by unifying all the provinces of the western part, which included all the erstwhile provinces, including the erstwhile, royalty and tribal areas
 is praant main 12 pramandal the, or isaki rajdhani lahore thi
 On the other hand, the province of East Bengal was named East Pakistan, with its capital at Dhaka
 sangheey rajdhani ko varsh 1959 main karanchi se rawalpindi sthanantarit kiya gaya, jahaan sena mukhyalay tha, or nai rajdhani, islamabad ke puraa hone tak yahaan maujuud rahaa jabaki sangheey vidhanpalika ko dhaka main sthapit kiya gaya
 Although the main objective of this policy was to bring about administrative reforms, but it was a very destructive step in terms of linguistic and regional-caste identity and development
 tathaa, purvakthith, sindh evam purvi bengal jaise praanton kii prantiy sarkaron ke atirikt, ise bhashvadi va kshetreey-rashtravaadi vichardhariyon va raajnneetigyon kii aalochana evam purazor virodh kaa bhi saamana karnaa padaa
 These included the princely states and princely states, who had decided to join Pakistan at the time of partition only on the assurance that their autonomy would be maintained, but with the coming of the forest unit, all these local states would also be eliminated, joining West Pakistan
 Had done it
 is sambandh main bahawalpur, kerpur or kalaat ke rajya visheshkar ullekhneey hai
 Matters became more serious when the post of Chief Minister was abolished after the 1958 coup and the President took all the authority of West Pakistan in his hands
 kai raajnneetik visheshgyon kaa yah bhi maananaa hai ki pashchimi pakistan ke sabhi praanton ko ekajute karne ke uddeshy purvi pakistan kii bhashaai or raajnneetik ikaio kaa jor todna bhi tha
 It was also the effort of many politicians to eliminate various regional traditions and cultures of Pakistan and bring Pakistan to a national culture
 atah vibhinn kshetreey praanton ke ant se puure desh ko ek saanskrithik ikai banane main suvidha hoti
 Therefore, this policy was also brought to promote a national culture by eliminating the provincial and regional cultures
 aisa bhi kaha jaataa he kii is yojana ke peeche kii asal kaaran prashasnic se adhik "raajnneetik" thi, is ke anusaar, is chaal kaa mukhya uddeshy, pashchimi pakistan ko busankhyak purvi hisse se baraabar kii rajnatik shakti ke str par laana tha
 Although the population of Papovi Pakistan was more on the basis of population, but in the politics of Pakistan, West Pakistanis, and especially Punjabis, had more hold and sway
 parantu raajnneetik rahanumaon ke man main yah bhay tha kii yadi loktantrik aadarshon ke anusaar, sidhe sidhe, jansankhya ke aadhaar par raajnneetik pratididhitiv kii vyavastha sthapit ho gayi, to, pakistan kii puri siyaasi takat, purv main kendrit ho jaayegi
 Therefore, to avoid this situation, all the states of West Pakistan were merged and made a province so that its total population is more majority than East Pakistan
 aisa kaha jaataa he kii yah yojana, keval, purvi hisse ke voton ko punarsantulit karne ke liye laayi gayi thi
 The second martial law in Pakistan was imposed on 26 March 1969 when President Ayub Khan abolished the 1962 Constitution and handed over power to the commander-in-chief of the army, General Aga Mohammad Yahya Khan
 raashtrapati pad sanbhaalane par, general yahya khan pashchim pakistan main lokapriy maang par ek ikai vyavastha ko khatm kar diya or ek aadmi ek vot ke siddhant par aam chunaav kaa aadesh diya
 a unit system came to an end with Issey, and the former provinces of Pakustan were restored

 Ghazals are of two types based on rhyme - bhav ke aadhaar par bhi gazalen do prakaar kii hoti hai- Ghazals began as a poetic genre of Arabic literature
 arabi bhashaa main kahi gayi gazalen vastav main naam ke hi anuroop thi arthath usamen auraton se baaten yaa uske bare main baaten hoti thi
 After coming from Arabic to Persian literature, this genre remained unchanged at the level of craftsmanship, but in terms of the narrative, they overtook them
 unamem baat to daihik yaa bhautik prem kii hi kii gai kintu uske arth vistaar dwaara daihik prem ko aadhyatmik prem main badal diya gaya
 Arabic love became popular in Persian
 farsi ghazal main premi ko sadik or premika ko mabood kaa darja mil gaya
 Sufi seekers played a decisive role in giving Ghazal its form
 sufi sadhana virah pradhan sadhana he
 Therefore, in the Persian ghazals, the separation aspect took precedence rather than coincidence
 farsi se urdu main aane par bhi ghazal kaa shilpagat rup jyon kaa tyon sweekaar kar liya gaya lekin kathy bhartiya ho gaya
 But contrary to the common concept of North India, Indian ghazals originated in the Deccan during the Bahmani Sultanate where ghazals influenced by songs were written
 bhashaa kaa naam rekhta padaa
 Vali Dakani, Siraj Daud etc
 were the poets of this tradition who in a way carried forward the tradition of Amir Khusro
 dakkini urdu ke gazalakaaron ne arabi farsi ke badale bhartiya pratikon, kavy roodhiyon, evam saanskrithik prishthbhumi ko lekar rachana kii
 At that time, the language of royalty in North India was Persian, so when Ghazal came to North India, Persian influence on it started increasing
 gaalib jaise urdu ke shreshth gazalkaar bhi farsi gazalon ko hi mahatvapurn maanate rahe or urdu gajal ko farsi ke anuroop banane kii koshish karte rahe
 Later, during the Dawood era, the influence of Persian was somewhat reduced
 ikbaal kii aarambhik gazalen isi prakaar kii he
 Later, due to political conditions, the influence of Persian on the Urdu ghazals started increasing again
 1947 ke baad isamen punah kami aane lagi

 Vesak in Thailand mahavihar main ves utsav Vesak in Singapore, 2002 malaysia main ves utsav Aggression is a part of our daily lives, but psychological aggression is difficult to tie to just one meaning
 aakraamakata vividh rup le sakati hai, or ho saktaa he yah donon shaareerik rup or / yaa maukhik rup se yaa gaiyr maukhik rup se vyakt kii ja sakati hai
 Aggression comes from the Latin word aggrasio
 shastriyon dwaara aakraamakata kaa adhyayan is liye kiya jaataa he kyonki iskaa sambandh jaanwaron parsparik mail tathaa prakritik paryaavaran main vikaas sambandhit he
 Definition of aggression: noun 1
 by force, especially its territorial rights; The action of one state in violation of the rights of another state, an unprovoked offensive, assault, invasion army is ready to stop any foreign invasion
 kisi bhi aakraamak karrwai, hamale, yaa prakriya; ek atikaraman: kisi ke adhikaron par koi akraman Affective aggression: harm by command to obtain something
 bhaavnaatmak aakraamakata: apane liye haani pahuchaanna
 Aggression can occur due to physical and psychological reasons
 shaareerik anuvanshik yaa sahaj iraadon or manovaigyanik kisi sthiti main hone ke kaaran yaa ling bhed hone ke kaaran ho
 Many feel that aggression is the basic trend
 bhale hi shaayad logon ne frid kii maut-vritti ke vishay main padhaa nahin he
 And even if read, one should hardly accept the notion of death-instinct
 lokapriy str par aakraamakata ko ek janmajaat aantarik rup se nirdeshit vinaashkari pravarti kaa ek bahya visthapana ke rup main itnaa nahin dekha jaataa he, balki ek saarvbhaumik bahya rnideshit pravarti, sambhawatah ek uttarjivita pravriti se judaa ek gun ke rup, main jo jaanwaron ko maanav jati ke saath ekajute karti he
 Many believe that studying the non-human animal world can be beneficial for a clear understanding of human aggression
 kornad lobhainz, jinaki 1966 main aakraamakata par likhi kitaab ne pramukh prabhaav banaaya
 Llanz's study is based on various animal species, particularly fish and birds, and slightly non-human-like animals
 lobhainz ne in vibhinn prajatiyon main ek pravriti dekhi, kii vah apni hi prajati ke duusare samoohon se atikaraman kii koshish se kshetra kii raksha karte hai, apni prajati kii maadaa ko paane ke liye pratidwandvi ko haraana or apni prajati ke navjaat evam yuva aayu or rakshahin sadasyon kii raksha karnaa
 Lowenz finds that such aggression acts as a 'balanced distribution' in animals of the same species on that available environment
 or yah jin-pool ko lagaataar majbooti pradaan karti he ore lagaataar sudhaarti he, or navjaat evam yuva sadasyon ke atijivan kii sambhaavna ko badhaati he
 In these three ways, aggression helps the species to make it more environmentally friendly and improve regularly
 lobhainz is ke alaava aakraamakata ko, saamaajik sanrachana ke vikaas main ek mahatvapurn bhoomika ke liye bhi shrey dete hai
 Aggression refers to a tendency to assume a penetrating effect as an expression of aggression
 anubhavjanya anusandhan, haalanki, is par shaq daalata he
 Unfortunately those who follow the principle of penetrating effect have been proven wrong
 vah dampati jo aapas main bahes karaten hai un main hinsak banane kii pravriti adhik hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 Husbands who push their wives are most likely to slap and punch their wives
 aapraadhik hinsa ke ek vyakti kii is saal hinsa karne kii sambhaavna kaa sabase acha bhavishyavaktaa uske pichley saal ke aapraadhik hinsa kaa itihaas he
 Violence is causing violence instead of it
 aakraamakata kaa doosraa siddhant janmajaat purvavritti se hat ke bahya rup kii uttejnaaon ko aakraamakata ke sroton ke rup main maanata he
 The central assumption is that aggression is defined stimuli, defined stimuli called frustration
 shastreey granthon main is vishay main dollard or unke sahyogiyon ne shuru main saahasik do bhaagi abhikthan kii rachana kii, jisamen yah kaha 'aakraamak vyavhaar kii ghatana kaa kaaran hameshaa hataasha kaa hona mana gaya', or yah ki ' hataasha kaa hona hameshaa aakraamakata ko kisi na kisi rup main janm detaa he
 "human behavior is complex and multidimensional; it is unusual and courageous to imagine that any stimulus will always have a specific behavioral response or that the same particular stimulus occurred before a specific behavioral response
 or, vastav main, dollard or unke sahyogi is mat par shuruyaat se aalochana ke liye taiyaar the
 Dollard and his collaborators define frustration as "an interference with a provoked goal-response event at the appropriate time in the behavioral sequence"
 sambhav he ki ham "uksaave ddwara lakshya pratikriya" jaisi bhashaa se parichit nahin ho
 We can easily understand from the experiences of our struggles - weary losers do not get to eat after coming home from work, do not get the promotion they deserve, the child who is excluded from playing on the playground in school
 barkovitaz do badalane vaale vyavadhaanon krodh or vyakhya kaa istemaal karaten he
 He proposes that "every desperation provokes and exacerbates aggression, but defines this provocation here as anger, and anger will only give rise to aggression" when appropriate cues or reasons are present
 yahan, barkovitaz is baat ki anumati detaa he vyakti yah sikh lete hai ki krodh ko akramakata dwaara vyakt karnaa anuchit he or isliye jab hataasha kaa protsaahan teevr ho tab bhi akramakata kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he
 Frustration-aggression seems to be the primary source of human violence potential
 jaruri nahin kii hataasha hi hinsa kaa kaaran ho, kuch vyaktiyon ke liye laabh kii ummiden hinsa karne ko prerit karatin hai
 Although desperation, induced anger, without considering the cause, causes individuals to be aggressive, if the frustration lasts long enough or is felt rapidly, aggression will be more likely to occur if not definitively
 is myne main kuntha-aakraamakata kii kriyavidhi gurutvkarshan ke samroop he: kunthit vyaktiyon main hinsa karne janmajaat prakruti kii tivrata unki hataasha ke anupaat main hoti he
 There are many reasons that affect the behavior of individuals under different circumstances: their beliefs, beliefs, inhibitions and social environment for individuals
 vastuon ke liye gurutvkarshan, urja or madhyam ke gun jisamen ve sthit hai
 But it also seems less possible to consider the merits of those individuals who incite people to political violence
 thik usee tarah jis tarah vayuyan ke nirmaan ke liye gurutvkarshan siddhant kii andekhi karnaa
 The school's argument is not to accept that aggression is inherently due to desperation, but that aggression is largely a learned behavior
 is skool ke anuyaayi yah maanate hai ki kai samaajon main aakraamakata kaaphi had tak anupasthit he yaa aakraamak vyavhaar nakal se hoti he jabaki vahaan koi uttejnaa niraashaa nahin he
 Albert Bandura is a leading researcher, thinker and innovator in social learning theory of aggression
 udhaaharan ke liye unke prayog ne dikhaaya he, ki bacchon ko jo aakraamak vayask model kaa dekhte hai ve bhi is vyavhaar kii nakal ek bilkul nai sthiti main bhi karte hai
 The children of the controlled group, on the other hand, do not do this, and will again be the same when the models are on film
 albert or walters is hi tarah kaa avlokan evam adhyayan saamaajik or vyaktitv vikaas main report kiya he
 This school's conclusion of thinking on aggression is expressed as: "human aggression is a learned behavior, eg, under other types of social behavior, arousal, reinforcement, and cognitive control
" logon ne kaise siikhaa kii aakraamak nahin hona chaiye? petricia draper dwaara prastut unke vichaar main ek model kung kalahari registan ke bachche paalan kii prathaon ke hai
 Draper indicates at least three aspects of discouraging children from aggressive responses in an environment: 1
 "jab do chote bachche bahes yaa ladanaa shuru karte hai, vayask unhen sazaa yaa, sikh nahin dete; ve bacchon ko alag kar prayek bachche ko ek vipareet disha main le jate hai
 Adults try to calm them down and encourage the distracted child to show interest in other things
 " isi tarah kaa hastkshep yukti dwaara bade bacchon ke saath prayog kiya jaataa he, gut kaa netaa ko dur bula ke yaa vayask bade bacchon samooh main shaamil ho jate hai
 2
 "large scale adult corporal punishment, and non-use of aggressive currency and adult society's use of aggressive currency should be avoided and devalued" 3
 " vayaskon ke dwaara bachche ke guse ke visphot kii lagaataar andekhi agar yah nuksaan nahin karata he tab
 At such times, a child's frustration is intense, but he learns that the display of anger is not meant to garner the adult's attention or sympathy
 " The way in which the modified version of the frustration – aggression hypothesis exerts some influence in an individual's learning to mediate the response to aggression
 isliye saamaajik shiksha siddhantkaron kaa yah maananaa he ki jis vyakti aakraamak pratikriyaaon siikhaa he us hi vyakti kaa unhen istemaal karena ki adhik sambhaavna he
 In fact, they see frustration as a possible cause for instigating aggressive behavior, but emphasize that aggression is learned from social behavior rather than an automatic response to aggression or any other incentive

 The swing is a practical example of this
 dolan karata hua lolak kisi ek bindu jitne samay baad punah waapas aa jaataa he use uskaa 'aavartkaal' kehete hai
 If the pendulum has a low amplitude, its periodicity does not depend on the amplitude but only on the pendulum's length and the local value of gravity acceleration
 lolak kaa aavartkaal lolak ke dravyaman par bhi nirbhar nahin karata
 Where l is the length of the pendulum, and g is the value of accelerated gravity at that location
 is sutara se saaf he ki yadi aayam kam ho to aavartkaal alag-alag ayaamon ke liye samaan hoga
 This property of pendulum is called 'synchronism'

 However, if the amplitude is large, the periodicity is not fixed, but increases gradually as the amplitude increases

 The word ‘tatar’ has had different expressions at different times
 kuch logon kaa vichaar he ki pracheen kaal main madhya asia kii tartar naamak nadi ke sambandh se tartar kahe jane lage
 On the contrary, some say that Tatar was actually the name of a prince of Turkish race, whose brother was named Mongol
 is kaaran tartar rajkumaar ke vanshavaale tartar kahe jane lage or mongol rajkumaar ke vanshavaale mongol kehalaae
 New researches have proved both these approaches wrong but no definite facts have been known yet
 ab tak ke kul gyaat saakshyon main sabase pracheen aathvin shatee ke turki bhashaa ke urkhooni lekh hai jinamein "tees tataron" tathaa "nau tataron" kaa ullekh he
 It is also proved from the same articles that at that time this word was not related to Turks directly to Mongols or to any Mongol branch

 Nevertheless, Europeans continued to call them Tatars and the people of Alatun Urdu state and later other rulers of this state were also called Tatars, even though they accepted the religion of Islam in the 14th century AD
 iske badwaale samay main rus tathaa pashchimi europe main usamaani turkon ke sivaa sabhi shuddh turkon ke liye 'tartar' shabd prayukt hone laga or chini mongolon ko bhi tartar kehane lage
 The word Tatar is now used as a specific ethnic name only for the Turkish barners in the vicinity of the Volga River, from Kazan to Astrakhan, settled in Crimea or Karim and a part of Siberia

 'C' is currently the first or second most popular programming language
 yah bhashaa vibhinn software flatformon par bahutayat main upyog kii jaati he
 There is hardly any computer-platform for which c compiler is not available
 si++, java, si # aadi anek programmen bhashaaon par si bhashaa kaa gaharaa prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 In 1960, the University of Cambridge developed a computer programming language which they named BASIC COMBINED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
 ise saamaanya bol-chaal kii bhashaa main bi kaha gaya
 The 'B' language was modified in 1972 by the computer scientist Danish Ritchie in the Bell Laboratory
 ’si’ programing bhashaa ’bi’ programing bhashaa kaa hi sanshodhit rup he
 'C' can be used in both Unix operating system and DOS operating system, the difference is only of compiler
 unics oparating system ’si’ main likhaa gaya oparating sisstom he
 It is specially designed to use 'C' only, so most of 'C' is used only on Unix operating system
 si-bhashaa maamuli antar ke saath kai upbhaashaon ke rup main milti he
 The ANSI c developed by the American National Standards Institute is mostly considered a standard

 It takes about one second to count from 0 to 15000, while in basic this work takes about 50 seconds
 ’si’ programing bhashaa main program main prayog karne hetu anek functions paribhaashit hote he parantu isame ek atirikt suvidha yah bhi he ki programmer apni aavashyaktaanusaar nae functions bhi paribhaashit kar saktaa he
 Only 32 words are used in it, as well as there are many other supporting programs in it, with the help of which complex functions can also be successfully done
 yah mukhyat: ganit, vigyaan evam system sambandhit kaaryo ke kaam aati he
 Only lower case letters are used when giving instructions in this language
 uparokt visheshtao ke kaaran hi ’si’ ek atyadhik lokapriy computer programing bhashaa he
 Before that we have come to know how any variable is preserved in the computer's memory
 jahaan yah char sangrakshit hota he uskaa ek nishchit pataa bhi hota he jo yah bataata he ki char kaa maan memory main kahan sangrakshit he
 This address is called pointer
 c / C++ programmen bhashaa main yah suvidha bhi hoti he ki kisi char kaa pataa gyaat kiya ja saken 
 In c / c ++ programming languages also use & to find out the variable
 jaise ki agar koi purnank char x he to x kaa pataa &x se mil jaayegaa
 Just as integers, letters, real numbers, etc
 are preserved in the variable, so does the leaf of a variable
 iske liye ek nayaa datatip hota he jo pataa sangrakshit karne ke kaam aata he jis tarah se purnank sangrakshit karne ke liye int datatype kaa upyog hota he
 Use the int * datatype to preserve the address of an integer variable
 isi tarah akshar char kaa pataa sangrakshit karne ke liye char* datatype kaa upyog karte hai
 a small example is given below in which one variable preserves the address of another variable
 yahan pehle ek purnank char x paribhaashit kiya gaya he, phir p aisa char paribhaashit kiya he jo kisi purnank kaa pataa sangrakshit karata he
 Then put the address of x in the p variable
 pataa → 0 1 2 3 4memory → 1 xxrep 4 0 111 11100101 00100110 xxrep 4 0 101 01100101 
 
 
 ↑ p = &x = 3 int x ab char ek purnank pointer p he jisamen char x kaa pataa sangrakshit he arthath p ko likhavane par x kaa pataa likhaa jaayegaa
 If we want to know what memory is written in p on that memory, then we must write a main function to use * p
 kyonki ’si’ compiler kisi bhi program ko nishpadit karnaa main function se aarambh karata he
 a file or a program cannot have more than one main function
 yah ek prayogkarta dwaara paribhaashit function he
 The main function is initialized by brackets '{'
 program sanchika ke nishpaadan ke samay ’{’ yah bataata he ki nishpaadan yahan se aarambh karnaa he
 Similarly '}' tells that execution is to end here
 ek program main main function to ek hi rahata he parantu anya function kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he
 a subprogram is given between {and} for each function
 prayek nirdesh kaa ant semikalan ’;’ dwaara hona aavashyak he

 kisi bhi bhashaa ke ang pratyang kaa vishleshan tathaa vivechan vyakaran kehalaata he
 Grammar is the discipline through which to speak, speak, read and write in a pure language
 kisi bhi bhashaa ke likhane, padhane or bolne ke nishchit niyam hote hai
 It is necessary to follow these rules to maintain the purity and beauty of the language
 ye niyam bhi vyakaran ke antargat aate hai
 Grammar is an important part of language study
 kisi bhi "bhashaa" ke ang pratyang kaa vishleshan tathaa vivechan "vyakaran" kehalaata he, jaise ki sharir ke ang pratyang kaa vishleshan tathaa vivechan "sharirshastra" or kisi desh pradesh aadi kaa varnan "bhugol"
 That is, the grammar does not rotate a language by its command, it manifests the position tendency of the direct language
 "chalata he" ek kriyaapad he or vyakaran padhe bina bhi sab log ise isi tarah bolte hai; iskaa sahi arth samaj lete hai
 Grammar will analyze this term to show that it has two components - "walks" and "is"
 phir vah in do avyavon kaa bhi vishleshan karke batayega ki "chalata" or "he" ke bhi apane avyav hai
 Two characters are evident in "chal"; But the grammar will make it clear that "ch" has two letters "ch" and "A"
 isi tarah "l" main bhi "l" or "a"
 These letters can no longer be fragments; These are the "letters"
 vyakaran in aksharon kii bhi shrenee banayega, "vyanjan" or "swar"
 "ch" and "L" are consonants and "A" vowels
 chi, chi or li, lee main swar hai "i" or "i", vyanjan "ch" or "l"
 This type of analysis is very useful; It is not a waste business
 yah vishleshan hi "vyakaran" he
 The other name of grammar is also "shabhanushasana"
 vah shabdasambandhi anushaasan karata he - batalaata he ki kisi shabd kaa kis tarah prayog karnaa chahie
 The tendency of words in the language remains its own; Words do not work in the language of grammar
 parantu bhashaa kii pravriti ke anusaar vyakaran shabdaprayog kaa nirdesh karata he
 It does not rule the language, it does its teaching according to its position
 yadhyapi bahu nadhishe tathaapi path putr vyakaranam
 Swajno Shwajno Mahabhutsakalam Shakalam padho taaki 'swajan' 'shwajan' na bane or 'sakal' 'shakal' na bane tathaa 'sakrut' 'shakrut' na ban jaay
 ) sansar main sabase pehle "vyakaran" vidya kaa janm kahaan hua? The linguists of the world have unanimously accepted that the most ancient Vedas in the literature available on this earth
 rugveda sansar kaa pracheenatam sahitya he
 When a language starts to glow with the richness of literature, then its grammar is needed
 "veda" kaisaa mahatvapurn sahitya he, yah isi se samajha ja saktaa he ki ise itane dinon tak manushya ne gale se lagaakar praanon kii tarah isaki raksha kii he
 It is not a simple task to keep each of his mantras memorized in the form and keep his "sound" safe
 sookhe chane chaba chabaakar tapasvi brahmanon ne vedon kii raksha kii he
 That is why he remained
 veda jaise mahatvapurn sahitya ke vyakaran kii jarurat padi
 With the help of grammar, Jnanpipasu of far-off regions can understand the literature originating elsewhere and people are able to understand it even after the passage of eternity
 veda jaisaa sahitya deshkal kii seemaa main bandhaa rahanevaala nahin he; isliye prabud "dev" janon ne apane raja se prarthana kii-"hamaari bhashaa kaa vyakaran bananaa chahie
 You make grammar of our language
 " tab tak vedbhaasha "avyaakruta" thi; use yon hi log kaam main laa rahe the
 Indra accepted the prayers of the Devas by saying "varam" and then breaking the posts between them to distinguish the nature suffix etc
 - became grammar
 is prakaar bharat main sabase pehle "vyakaran" vidya kaa janm hua
 Grammar does not stop the movement of language, as stated earlier; And neither does it change with grammar
 kisi desh pradesh kaa bhugol kya vahaan kii gatividhi ko roktaa badalata he? bhashaa to apni gati se chalati he
 Grammar is neither its regulator nor its inhibitor
 haan, sahasron varsh baad jab koi bhashaa kisi duusare rup main aa jaati he, tab vah vyakaran is ke liye anupayogi ho jate he
 Then it will have a separate grammar
 vah purana vyakaran tab bhi bekaar na ho jayega; us puraani bhashaa kaa yatharth parichay detaa rahegaa
 This is not an ordinary utility
 haan, yadi koi kisi bhashaa kaa vyakaran apane agyaan se galat bana de, to vah hi galat hoga
 The language will not follow it and even if it violates the rules of that grammar, the language will not be called wrong
 sanskrit ke ek vaiyaakaran ne "punsu" ke saath "punkshu" pad ko bhi niyambaddh kiya; parantu vah vahiin dharaa rah gaya
 Nobody ever said "punkshu"
 panini ne "vishram" shabd sadhu batalaaya; "shram" kii hi tarah "vishram"
 But "rest" continued in Sanskrit literature; Running and going on
 bhashaa kii pravriti he
 When Panini could not stop the flow of language, then what is the number of others? vyakaran tathaa bhashavigyaan do shabdashastra hai; donon kaa kaaryakshetra bhinn-bhinn he; par ek duusare ke donon sahyogi hai
 Grammar considers mere usage; While linguistics describes the origin of the original form of "verse" as the method of etymology or evolution
 vyakaran yah batalaayegaa ki "na" kaa rup "a" yaa "an" ho jaataa he
 Vyanjanadi words have "A" and Swaradi has "an" - "unique", "unique"
 jab nishedh main pradhanta ho, tab samaas nahin hota - ayan brahmano naasti", "asya upama naasti"
 Elsewhere "abraham: Vedadhyayan Mandadara: Santi" and "anupam Kashmirsundarya Darsham" etc
 will be compounded; Because prohibition is not positive
 vyakaran samaas bataa degaa or kahan samaas thik rahegaa, kahan nahin; yah sab batalaana "sahitya shaastra" kaa kaam he
 The consonant from the "N" becomes "A" and the alphabet becomes "A"
 isi "an" ko saswar karke "an" rup main "samaas" ke liye hindi ne le liya he - "anhoni", "anjaan" aadi
 These diverse forms of "no" do not make grammar; He fills the "narrative" of the created forms
 yah kaam bhashavigyaan kaa he ki vah "na" ke in roopon par prakaash daale
 The grammar will show that by adding the suffix "no" to a metal, adding the Hindi noun "aa" to it becomes expressive nouns - coming, going, getting up, sitting, etc
 parantu vyakaran kaa kaam yah nahin he ki aa, ja, uth, baith aadi dhaatuon kii vikasapaddati samajhaae
 This work is of linguistics
 sanskrit main aisi sangyaayen napunsak varg main prayukt hoti hai - aagamanam, gamnam, utthanam, upaveshnam aadi
 But in Hindi there is a pamprayoga- "when did you come?" The grammar will not tell why Hindi has used
 vah anvakhyaan bhar karegaa -"aisi sangyaayen punwargeey rup rakhti he" bas! yah bataanaa bhashavigyaan kaa kaam he ki aisa kyon hua! When a language takes a word from another language, it rules it out - governs its speed according to its grammar
 hindi kaa "dhoti" shabd angreji main gaya, to vahaan ise angreji vyakaran ko shirodharya karnaa padaa
 It is used in English - "brining our dhoties"
 vahaan "dhoti" kaa bahuvachan "dhotiyaan" na chalegaa
 The "bring Our Dhots" experiment will be misunderstood there
 isi tarah angreji kaa "foot" shabd hindi ne liya or apane shashan main rakhaa
 The plural of "foot" in English is "feet"; But English grammar will not work in Hindi
 prayog hota he - "chaar foot oonchaai", "chaar feet oonchaai" galat he
 "height" is also incorrect; "height" is pure
 "nichaai unchaai" hota he; "nichai oonchaai" nahin
 In Sanskrit, the dialects of unambiguous words become interchangeable - "poet samagatau"; This will not happen in Hindi
 "do kavi aae" kaha jayega
 Similarly "sanskriti samagatau" in Sanskrit
 hindi main "rajdampati" sarvatra
 It is also a process of assimilating testamentary words to cut the mismatched form and make it into your mail
 hindi kaa "ganga ji" shabd angreji main gaya; par "genzis" banaakar
 English took the word "lantern" from Hindi; But by making "lantern" and "hospital" by "hospital"
 "hospital" bhi hindi main galat he
 Forms like "hospital" and "doctor" are not acceptable to Hindi
 hindi kaa vyakaran niyaman karegaa ki hindi main vah uccharan he hi nahin, jise swar par ulta top rakh kar prakat kiya jaataa he
 Here "doctor" runs like "master"
 haan, nagari lipi main angreji bhashaa likhni ho tab vah ulataa top kaam aayega - da doctor vaaz phulish"
 In the same way, if you want to write a language like Persian in Nagari, then "market", "need", etc
 forms; But there will be no dot below in Hindi - "there is a market for essential things
 " urdu ke sher aadi likhane hon to bhi neeche vindi lag jaaegi
 This form of words will be from the grammatical case of grammar

 is
 prashn jab un pallav-adharon se foot padaato us se naveen makarand kii kanikas chu padin;aah, jigyaasa jab pehali baar aatma se footati haitab kitni aswaady ban jaati he teri madhurima ! kahan se ? kahan se ?meraa antajkaran bhi ratane laga yah aadim mantra
 Among all things, i began to hear the same echo with my inner ear; o respondent great question! Hail the divine imagination that has engraved you in the upright soul of a wise man! Or you are the Golden kirti-pennaka who is expressing the importance of human beings in the world
 dhvanit ho rahe ho tum samast charaacharon ke bheetar shaayad, aatmshodh kii prerana dene valetumhaare aamantran ko sunakargaayen dekh rahi hai apni parchhaayi ko jhukkar
 Sparrows are finding themselves with their beaks in the spreading fingers
 khoj rahaa he ashwatth apni deergh jataaon ko failakarmitti main chhipe mul beej ko; or, sadiyon ssapane hi sharir kaa vishleshan kar rahaa he pahaad
 Oh my imagination, you are trying in vain to touch the supernatural elements
 kahan tak unchi ud sakegi yah patangumere mastishk kii pakad main ?jhuk jaao mere sir, munne ke jigyaasa bhare prashn ke saamne ! gir jaao, he granth-vigyaan mere sir par ke nirarthak bhaar-se tum is mitti par
 You do not even have a corpus in the breast to extinguish the increased truth of the child
 is nanheen si buddhi ko thaamne-sanbhaalane ke liye koi shaktishaalee aadhaar bhi tumhaare paas nahin ! ho saktaa he, maanav kii chintaa prithvi se takraayeor siddhanth kii chinagaariyaan bikher de
 But, in the darkness, the essence of that great truth remains the same even today
 ghadiyaan bhaagi ja rahi thim sau-sau chintaaon ko kuchalakar;vismayakari veg ke saath ud-ud kar chhip rahi thimkhaare samudr kii badalati hui bhavanaekavyakt aakaar ke saath, antariksh ke path par
 My son repeated the question, impatient at the silence of the mother
 "mere laal, meri buddhi kii ashanka abhi tak thithak rahi heis viraat prashn main dubkee lagane ke liye or jis kotal-sparshi aankhon ne bhi nahin dekha he, us vastu ko tatolane ke liye
 Where did we all come from? i don't know anything! These little ones of yours can only be measured by your hands
