 This era can be anyone - ancient or archaic
 is kaam ke liye aajkal adhiktar isvi san kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The last year was used for this work in our country and in Europe, in ancient times and sometimes even today, Julian period is used
 jagat ke vividh deshon or vividh kaalon main alag-alag sanwat prachlit the
 Not only this, in a huge country like India, many cultures were prevalent nowadays and also in the past
 in sab sanwaton ke prachaar kaa aarambh bhinn-bhinn kaal main hua or unke varshon kaa aarambh bhi vibhinn rituon main hota tha
 Additionally, the type of calculation of year, month and day also differed
 saamanyat: varsh kaa maan rituchakra ke tulya rakhane kaa praytn kiya jaataa tha, parantu islamic sanwat hijri ke anusaar vah keval baarah chandra maason, arthath 354 dinon kaa, varsh hota tha, jo rituchakra ke tulya nahin he
 Some years were a mixture of lunar and solar, as is practiced in many provinces of India nowadays
 isamen 12 chandra maason kaa ek varsh hota he, parantu do yaa teen varshon main ek adhimaas badhaakar varsh ke madhya maan ko rituchakra ke tulya banaaya jaataa he
 Each season-cycle-like year is also called a solar year, because its value is related to the sun
 upar hamane chandramaada kaa jo ullekh kiya he usko vastut: saura chandramaada kahana chahie, kyonki uskaa aadhaar surya or chandramaa ke saath mishra rup main he
 Till the full moon or from Amavasya to Amavasya, this lunar month is respected
 jaise varshmaan kii kalpana rituon par or maas kii kalpana chandramaa kii kalaon par ashrith he, usee prakaar din kii gananaa kii kalpana suryoday, suryaast, madhyahn athwa madhyaraatri se hui
 Generally, the mean time from one midday to the next is called a day
 jahaan chandra maas prachlit he, jaise bharat ke vibhinn pradeshon main, tithiyon se gananaa kii jaati he, jinka sambandh pradhanat: chandramaa kii kalaon ke saath he
 Thus, we see that in different regions of the world, calculations are done from different seasons, the beginning of the year also occurs in different seasons and there are different types of census and day census
 ab yadi kisi pracheen shilaalekh main hamane padhaa ki vah din amuk sanwat ke amuk maas kaa amuk din tha to prashn uthta he ki vah thik koun sa din tha
 It is often difficult to find an answer, because when that age started, what was its year-scale, and how were its months and days counted, we cannot determine the day without knowing all these things
 isliye pehle yah aavashyak he ki jagat ke bhinn-bhinn sanwaton kaa prarambh, arthath unke pratham varsh kaa aarambh kisi ek hi pramanit kiye hue sanwaton main bataaya jaae
 There have been many vows in the world from ancient times till today
 un sabakaa nirdesh ek vistrut lekh kaa vishay he
 Therefore, in the Appendix, the ancient and archaic of India will give the period of the beginning of some of the main temples

 san tak ke bich main 5 varsh vyayateet hue, aisa bhram hota he, jabaki vastut: yah antaraal 4 varsh kaa hi he
 That's why mathematicians and astrologers use other types of calculations in place of this census
 vah is prakaar he ki ve log 1 i

 By this system any BC The number of years spent between the year and any AD year will be impeccable

 Nowadays, generally, there are 365 days in a year and one year is 366 days in every four years

 This specific system of centuries was not there in ancient times
 1582 i
 tak shatabdi sahit sab varshon main prati chaar varsh main ek varsh 366 din kaa gina jaataa tha
 The 365-year year is called the normal year and the 366-day year is the leap year
 1582 i
 san pope gregory ne i

 The first improvement was that centenary days were arranged anew, which is prevalent nowadays
 vyavastha yah hui ki jis shatabdi ko 400 se ni:shesh vibhajit kiya ja sake vahi adhivarsh he; anya sab shatabdiyaan saamaanya varsh hai
 This rule has been done according to the subtle sion yearman derived from modern instruments of astrology

 This new system is called the new system and the previous method is called the ancient system

 'ram' dhaatu main 'ghan' pratyay ke yoga se 'ram' shabd nishpann hota he
 The meaning of 'rama' metal is related to Raman
 ve pranimaatr ke hriday main 'raman' karte hai, isliye 'ram' hai tathaa bhaktajan unamem 'raman' karte hai, isliye bhi ve 'ram' hai
 In his commentary on 'vishnusahsrnama', Adya Shankaracharya has quoted Padmapuran saying that Yogijans do Ramana in God, so they are 'rama'
 vaidic sahitya main 'ram' kaa ullekh prachlit rup main nahin miltaa he
 The word 'rama' is used only at two places in the Rigveda
 unamem se bhi ek jagah kaale rang ke arth main tathaa shesh ek jagah hi vyakti ke arth main prayog hua he; lekin vahaan bhi unke avtari purush yaa dasharath-putr hone kaa koi sanket nahin he
 Although Neelkanth Chaturdhar has chosen many of the mantras of the Rigveda in his own discretion, he has his own Ramakathapak meaning, but this is his personal belief
 swayan rugveda ke un prakarnon main praapt kisi sanket yaa kisi anya bhashyakaar ke dwaara un mantron kaa ramakthaparak arth siddh nahin ho paaya he
 In the Rigveda, 'ikshvakuh' is used at one place and the word 'dasharatha' is also used at one place
 parantu unke ram se sambaddh hone kaa koi sanket nahin mil paata he
 The word 'rama' is used in Brahmin literature at two sites in Aitareya Brahmana; But there he is called 'ramo Margaveyaah', which according to Acharya Sayan is the son of a woman named 'mrigavu'
 shatapath brahman main ek sthal par 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 Here 'rama' is as the Acharya of Yajna and he is called 'rama Aupatapasvini'
 taatpary yah ki prachlit ram kaa avtari rup valmikiy ramayana evam puraanon kii hi dein he
 The following description is available in relation to the birth of Rama in the most authentic scripture Adikavya Valmiki Ramayana related to Ramakatha: xxrep 22 
 chaitre navamike tithu
 
 nakshatreditidaivatye swocchsanstheshu panchasu
 Bhreeshu karkte lagne vakpavatinduna co
 
 That is, in the Navami Tithi of Chaitra month, in Punarvasu Nakshatra, when the five planets are in their high position and the position of Jupiter with the Moon in Cancer Ascendant
 yahan keval brihaspati tathaa chandramaa kii sthiti spasht hoti he
 Jupiter is exalted and the moon is self-possessed
 aage pandrahaven shloke main surya ke ucch hone kaa ullekh he
 In this way, Jupiter and Sun are known to be high
 budh hameshaa surya ke paas hi rahata he
 Therefore, it is impossible for Buddha to be high when the Sun is high
 is prakaar ucch hone ke liye bachate hai shesh teen grah -- mangal, shukr tathaa shani
 For this reason, almost all scholars have considered the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn to be high in the time of Rama's birth
 paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm treta yug main mana jaataa he
 According to the data available in Hindu theology, especially in mythological literature, a Chaturyugi has 43,20,000 years, of which Kaliyuga has 4,32,000 years and Dwapara 8,64,000 years
 ram kaa janm treta yug main arthath dwapar se pehle hua tha
 Since Kali Yuga has just begun and Rama was born at the end of Treta and the time of his present living on earth with an avatar has traditionally been considered as 11,000 years
 atah dwapar yug ke 8,64,000 varsh + ram kii vartmaanta ke 11,000 varsh + dwapar yug ke ant se abtak beete 5,100 varsh = kul 8,80,100 varsh
 Hence traditionally Rama's birth is considered to be about 8,80,100 years ago
 prakhyat marathi shodhakarta vidwaan dow0 padmakar vishnu vartak ne ek drushti se is samay ko sambhavya mana he
 They say that the height of Vindhyachal and Himalayas at one place in the Valmiki Ramayana is said to be the same
 vindhyachal kii oonchaai 5,000 feet he tathaa yah praayah sthir he, jabaki himalay kii oonchaai vartmaan main 29,029 feet he tathaa yah nirantar vardhansheel he
 The height difference between the two is 24,029 feet
 visheshgyon kii manyata ke anusaar himalay 100 varsho main 3 feet badhata he
 Therefore, it would have taken the Himalayas about 8,01,000 years to grow 24,029 feet
 atah abhi se kareeb 8,01,000 varsh pehle himalay kii oonchaai vindhyachal ke samaan rahi hogi, jiskaa ullekh valmikiy ramayana main vartmaankalik rup main hua he
 In this way Dr
 Vartak finds this time possible from a point of view, but he himself believes that he cannot confirm this time from any other source
 apane suvikhyath granth 'vastav ramayana' main dow0 vartak ne mukhyatah grahagatiyon ke aadhaar par ganit karke valmikiy ramayana main ullikhit grahasthiti ke anusaar ram kii vaastavik janm-tithi 4 disambar 7323 isapurv ko sunishchit kiya he
 According to him, Rama must have been born on this date between 1:30 to 3:00 pm
 dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak ke shodh ke anek varshon ke baad 'ai-sarv' ke ek shodh dal ne 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog karke shri ram kaa janm 10 janvari 5114 isapurv main siddh kiya
 He believed that the planets had the same position on this date as described in the Valmiki Ramayana
 parantu yah samay kaaphi sandehaaspad ho gaya he
 The 'planetarium Gold' software used by the research team of 'i-serve' is not really capable of doing true planetary mathematics before 3000 BC
 vastutah 2013 isvi se pehle itane pehle kaa grah-ganit karne hetu sakasham software uplabdh hi nahin tha
 Saturn was in Scorpio in the planetary position attained by this calculation, ie it was not in high
 chandramaa punarvasu nakshatra main na hokar pushya ke dwitiya charan main hi tha tathaa tithi bhi ashtami hi thi
 Later in the correct calculation done by ejplde431 software by another expert, the date becomes Navami but Saturn comes in Scorpio and in the fourth phase of Moon Pushya
 atah 10 janvari 5114 isapurv kii tithi vastutah shriram kii janm-tithi siddh nahin ho paati he
 In such a situation, if the date already refined by Dr
 p
v
vartak is certified by the software, then only the real time of Shri Ram will be able to be universally accepted or in case of not being certified, the path of research of new date will be opened

 King Dasharatha had three queens: Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi
 ram kaushalya ke putr the, sumitra ke do putr, lakshmana or shatrughna the or kaikeyi ke putr bharat the
 With the state rules, only the eldest son of a king is eligible to become a king, so Rama was sure to become the king of Ayodhya
 kaikeyi jinhone do baar dasharath kii jaan bachaai thi or dasharath ne unhen yah var diya tha ki wo jivan ke kisi bhi pal unase do var maang sakati he
 Kaikeyi wanted Rama to be king as Raja becoming king and looking to the future, so he granted Rama 14 years of exile by King Dasharatha and demanded the kingdom of Ayodhya for his son Bharata

 vah hiran ravan kaa mamaa marich tha
 He made a golden deer form at the behest of Ravana
 sita use dekh kar mohit ho gai or shriram se us hiran kaa shikaar karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Shri Ram started to fulfill his Indian desire and asked Lakshmana to protect Sita
 Maricha takes Sri Ram too far
 mauka milte hi shriram ne tir chalaaya or hiran bane marich kaa vadh kiya
 While dying, Marich shouted "O Sita! o Laxman!" Made a sound of Sita got worried after hearing that voice and she asked Lakshmana to go to Shri Ram
 Laxman did not want to go, but could not deny his sister-in-law
 lakshmana ne jane se pehle ek rekha khinchi, jo lakshmana rekha ke naam se prasiddh he

 One of the conspiracies of the Vaiseshika Hindus is philosophy
 iske mul pravartak rishi kanad hai 
 This philosophy is very similar to justice philosophy, but in reality it is an independent physicist philosophy
 is prakaar ke aatmadarshan ke vichaaron kaa sabase pehle maharishi kanad ne sutara rup main likhaa
 Kanad was a sage
 ye "uchhavriti" the or dhaany ke kanon kaa sangrah kar usee ko khaakar tapasya karte the
 That is why they were called "kanad" or "kanabhuk"
 kisi kaa kahana he ki kan arthath parmaanu tatv kaa sookshm vichaar inhone kiya he, isliye inhen "kanad" kehete hai
 Some people believe that they used to live in samadhi throughout the day and collect particles in the night
 yah vritti "ullu" pakshi kii he

 mimasaasutron kii tarah iske kuch sutron main punaruktiyaan hai - jaise "saamaanyavisheshabhavech" "saamanyatodrushtaachcha vishesh:", "tatvan bhaven", "dravyatvanityatve vayuna vyakhyate", "sandigdhstupachaar:" 
 There are two reasons for its naming - prayek nity dravya ko paraspar pruthak karne ke liye tathaa prayek tatv ke vaastavik swaroop ko pruthak-pruthak jaanane ke liye inhone ek "vishesh" naam kaa padaarth mana he ; "duality", "pakjotpatti" and "department of Departments" These three things have their own special view in which they are strong
 abhipraay yah he ki vaisheshik darshan vyaavhaarik tatwon kaa vichaar karne main sanlagn rahane par bhi sthool drushti se sarvatha vyavahaarat: samaan rahane par bhi, prayek vastu duusare se bhinn he
 They have emphasized the only special substance "special", so this section of ancient Indian philosophy is called "vaisesika" philosophy
 anya shastron ne is baat kaa vivechan nahin kiya he
 But for some of the above reasons, this philosophy has been termed as "vaishika Darshan"
 vaisheshik tathaa nyaay donon darshan hi "samantantr" hai
 The practical world is considered real
 ye bahya jagat tathaa antarjagat kii avadharana main paratpar evam ghanishtha sambandh maanate hai
 The external world is not dependent on thought, it is independent
 'aatmadarshan' ke liye vishwa kii sabhi choti-badi, tathvik tathaa tuchh vastuon kaa gyaan praapt karnaa saamaan rup se aavashyak he
 Knowledge of these elements requires evidence
 nyaayashastra main pramaan par vishesh vichaar kiya gaya he, kintu vaisheshik darshan main mukhya rup se 'prameya' ke vichaar par bal diya gaya he
 It is necessary to remember here that Vaishika, like justice, philosophically considers the 'real' elements of the world from a cosmic point of view
 loukik jagat kii vaastavik paristhitiyon kii upeksha vah kabhi nahin karata, tathaapi jahaan kisi tatv kaa vichaar bina sookshm drushti kaa ho nahin saktaa, vahaan kisi prakaar atindriya, adrusht, sookshm, yogaj aadi hetuon ke aadhaar par apane siddhant ko sthapit karnaa is dhara ke darshanikon kaa swabhaav he, anyathaa unki vaicharik bhitiyaan antarvirohi hotin ; faltah parmaanu, akaash, kaal, dik, aatma, man aadi sattaaon kaa sweekaar is darshan main baraabar upasthit he
 The nature, dress and ethos of Vaishyasikas are like 'nayayakis'; As such, these people are Shaiva, they were given Shaiva initiation
 inke chaar pramukh bhed hai - shaiva, pashupat, mahavrathdhar, tathaa kalmukh evam bharat, bhaktar, aadi gaun bhed bhi milte hai
 The Vaiseshiks are specifically called "pashupat"
 
 In Vaisesika opinion, the whole world is divided into these two divisions
 inamen "bhav" ke chah vibhaag kiye gaye hai- jinke naam hai - dravya, gun, karm, saamaanya, vishesh, tathaa samavaay
 There are also four sub-distinctions of absence - Pragbhava, Prabandhbhava, Extreme feeling and Interaction
 granthon main inke lakshan aadi kuch is tarah praapt hote hai : In matter, the "matter is caste" is the substance
 kaary ke samavayikaran ko dravya kehete hai
 Matter is a shelter of virtues
 prithvi, jal, tejas, vaayu, akaash, kaal, dik, aatma tathaa manas ye nau "dravya" kehalaate hai
 Of these, the first four liquids have two distinctions, Nitya and Anitya
 nityarup ko "parmaanu" tathaa anitya rup ko kaary kehete hai
 That part of the four ghosts is called "atom" which cannot be reparted, hence it is continual
 prithviparmanu ke atirikt anya parmaanuon ke gun bhi nity he
 The "earth" that smells, the "water" that has a cold touch, the "water" that has a warm touch, the "tejas", which does not have form and is not an accidental and imperfect touch of fire, that "air", And the word which has its merit, ie the word which is the samobhavana, is "sky"
 ye hi 'panchabhoot' bhi kehalaate hai
 These four "vibhu" matter are sky, space, space and soul
 manas abhautik parmaanu he or nity bhi he
 Today, tomorrow, this time, that time, month, year, etc
 is the simple reason for the behavior of time - that is time
 kaal nity or vyapak he
 The peculiar cause of the directions, directions, east, west, north, south, etc
, is "trouble"
 yah bhi nity tathaa vyapak he
 The form of soul and mind is the same as that of justice here
 gunakarya kaa asamavayikaran "gun" he
 Rupa, rasa, smell, touch, number, magnitude, separation, coincidence, divisions, divinity, immaturity, gravity, fluidity, affection, words, knowledge, pleasure, sorrow, desire, malice, effort, religion, unrighteousness and samskara
 There are differences of merit
 inamen se rup, gandh, ras, sparsh, sneh, swaabhaavik dravatv, shabd tathaa gyaan se lekar sanskaar paryant, ye "vaisheshik gun" hai, avshisht saadhaaran gun hai
 The qualities remain in matter
 karmkriya ko "karm" kehete hai
 Throwing up, throwing down, shrinking, spreading and moving, such as travel, pulsing, catharsis, etc
, are the differences of the five "karma"
 karm dravya hi main rahata he
 In general, because of the same intelligence that is present in many objects, the "this is this" in each component is the same type of intelligence, the reason is the "normal" in it, which is called "fast" in front of the object's name
 Goes, such as - components, patency
 "tv" se us jati ke antargat sabhi vyaktiyon kaa gyaan hota he
 It is regular and lives in matter, quality and action
 adhik sthaan main rahanevaala "saamaanya", "parasaamaanya" yaa "sattasamanya" yaa "par satta" kaha jaataa he
 The common substance, quality and deeds reside in all three
 prayek vastu main rahanevaala tathaa avyapak jo saamaanya ho, vah "apper saamaanya" yaa "saamaanya vishesh" kaha jaataa he
 Separating one object from another means normal
 visheshadravyon ke antim vibhaag main rahanevaala tathaa nity dravyon main rahanevaala "vishesh" kehalaata he
 This is the only substance that distinguishes between continents
 yah anant he
 There is a kind of relationship, which ties between the ingredients and the ingredients, the virtues and the virtues, the verb and the functional caste and the person and the special and continual matter
 vah ek he or nity bhi he
 The absence of something is called "absence" of that object
 iske chaar bhed hai - "prag abhaav" kaary utpann hon ke pehle kaaran main us kary kaa na rahanaa, "pradhwans abhaav" kaary ke naash hone par us kaary kaa na rahanaa, "atyant abhaav" teenon kaalon main jiskaa sarvatha abhaav ho, jaise vandhya kaa putr tathaa "anyonya abhaav" paraspar abhaav, jaise ghat main pat kaa na hona tathaa pat main ghat kaa na hona
 All these substances are under theorems of jurisprudence
 isliye nyaayadarshan main inkaa pruthak vichaar nahin he, kintu vaisheshik darshan main to mukhya rup se inkaa vichaar he
 According to the Vaisesika doctrine, attaining real knowledge of these seven substances gives freedom
 in donon samaan tatwon main padaarthon ke swaroop main itnaa bhed rahane par bhi donon darshan ek hi main mili rahete hai, iskaa kaaran he ki donon shastron kaa mukhya prameya he "aatma"
 The nature of the soul is the same in both philosophies
 anya vishay he - usee aatma ke jaanane ke liye upaay
 There is not much difference between these two philosophies
 keval shabdon main tathaa kahin-kahin prakriya main bhed he
 There is no difference in fruit
 atev nyaayamat ke anusaar pramaan, prameya aadi solah padaarthon ke tatvagyan se donon se ek hi prakaar kii "mukti" milti he
 Both have the same point of view
 nyaay vaisheshik mat main prithvi, jal, tejas tathaa vaayu inhen chaar dravyon kaa kaary rup main bhi astitv he
 In the opinion of these people, all the working substances are destroyed and they live in the sky in an atomic form
 yahi avasthaa "pralay" kehalaati he
 In this state, every individual soul exists with its mind and with the rites of deeds of previous births, and with religion and unrighteousness in the invisible form
 paratu is samay sristi kaa koi kaary nahin hota
 As a matter of fact, all things are waiting for the time when all the invincible functions of the organisms are ready to transform into form
 parantu adrusht jad he, sharir ke na hone se jeevatma bhi koi kaary nahin kar sakati, parmaanu aadi sabhi jad hai, phir "sristi" ke liye kriya kis prakaar utpann ho? In response to this, it should be known that for the welfare of the creatures that arise, a desire to create in the divine arises, due to which the unrivaled functions of the creatures become oriented
 parmaanuon main e prakaar kii kriya utpann ho jaati he, jisase ek parmaanu, duusare parmaanu se sanyukt ho jate hai
 a "mass" is produced by the addition of two atoms
 parthiv sharir ko utpann karne ke liye jo do parmaanu ikatthe hote hai ve parthiv parmaanu hai
 Both of them are synonyms of the "davanukas" generated
 un donon kaa sanyog asamavayikaaran he or adrusht, ishwar kii ichha, aadi nimittkaaran hai
 Similarly, aquatic, tajas etc
 should be understood in relation to the body
 yah samaran rakhana chahie ki sajaateey donon parmaanu maatr hi se sristi nahin hoti
 He is accompanied by an alien atom, such as an aqueous atom
 "dravyanuk" main anu-pariman he isliye vah drushtigochar nahin hota
 The work that will be generated from "the world" will also be atomic scale and that too will not be visible
 atev davyanuk se sthool kaary dravya ko utpann karne ke liye "teen sankhya" kii sahaayta lee jaati he
 In the nyaya-vaiseshika, gross matter is produced from matter with mass quantity and three numbers
 isliye yahan davyanuk kii teen sankhya se sthool dravya "tryanuk" yaa "trasarenu" kii utpatti hoti he
 The four triangles generate a quadrangle
 isi kram se pruthivi tathaa parthiv dravyon kii utpatti hoti he
 After the creation of matter, properties also arise in it
 yahi sristi kii prakriya he
 All the things that arise in the world are for the enjoyment of all the organisms that are born
 apane purvajanm ke karmon ke prabhaav se jeev sansar main utpann hota he
 In the same way, his body, vagina, clan, country, etc
 are all suited to enjoyment
 jab vah vishesh bhoga samaapt ho jaataa he, tab uski mrityu hoti he
 Similarly, at the end of their enjoyment, all living beings die
 nyaayamat - "sanhaar" ke liye bhi ek kram he
 In action, that is, in ghat, an action is produced in its components due to the strike
 us kriya se uske avyavon main vibhaag hota he, vibhaag se avyavi ke aarambhk sanyogon kaa naash hota he
 And then the component is destroyed
 isi kram se ishwar kii ichha se samast kaary dravyon kaa ek samay naash ho jaataa he
 It is clear from this that the termination of the termite is destroyed by the destruction of non-seasonal
 kabhi samavayikaaran ke naash se bhi kaarydravya kaa naash hota he
 Their aim is that the destroyed work cannot be destroyed without reason
 atev sristi kii tarah sanhaar ke liye bhi parmaanu main hi kriya utpann hoti he or parmaanu to nity he, uskaa naash nahin hota, kintu do parmaanuon ke sanyog kaa naash hota he or phir usase utpann "dravyanuk" rup kaary kaa tathaa usee kram se "tryanuk" evam "chaturanuk" tathaa anya kaaryon kaa bhi naash hota he
 According to macro vision, natural people do not think so subtle
 unke mat main aghat maatr hi se ek baargi sthool dravya nasht ho jaataa he
 Its properties are destroyed when the work material is destroyed
 isamen bhi purvawat do mat hai jinka nirupan "pakaj prakriya" main kiya gaya he
 Like the Nyaya Mantra, in the Vesic opinion, intellect, achievement, knowledge and suffix are words of similar meaning
 anya darshanon main ye sabhi shabd bhinn bhinn paribhaashik arth main prayukt hote hai
 Though there are many distinctions of the intellect, it has two distinct distinctions - "vidya" and "avidya", Avidya has four distinctions - Skepticism, Opportunity, non-business and Dream
 sanshay tathaa viparyay kaa nirupan nyaay main kiya gaya he
 There is no difference in their meaning in the Vaisesika faith
 anishchayatmak gyaan ko "anadhyavsaay" kehete hai
 For example, when looking at jackfruit, the narcotic islanders are suspicious of what it is when they see a cow with a cow, a cow, etc
 din bhar kaary karne se sharir ke sabhi ang thak jate hai
 They require rest
 indreu visheshkar thak jaati hai or man main leen ho jaati he
 Then the mind goes to rest in the full pulse through the psychotic pulse
 vahaan pahunchne ke pehle, purvakarmon ke sanskaron ke kaaran tathaa vaat, pitt or kaph in teenon ke vaishamy ke kaaran, adrusht ke sahare us samay man ko anek prakaar ke vishyon kaa pratyaksh hota he, jise swapngyaan kehete hai
 It should be kept in mind here that in the Vaisesika faith, "avidya" has been kept under knowledge and hence "avidya" is also called "false Knowledge"
 bahuton kaa kahana he ki ye donon shabd paraspar viruddh he
 The knowledge which is false cannot be called knowledge and the knowledge which is false can never be called false
 vidya bhi chaar prakaar kii he - pratyaksh, anumaan, smriti tathaa aarsh
 It is to be kept in mind here that "memory" in justice is not called realism
 vah to gyaat hi kaa gyaan he
 Similarly, "aarash Gyan" is not considered to be impermanent
 naiyayikon ke shabd yaa aagam ko anumaan main tathaa upmaan ko pratyaksh main vaisheshikon ne antarbhoot kiya he
 The sages who created the Veda have the knowledge of the past and the future as the direct
 usamen indriya or arth ke sannikarsh kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati
 This is called "pratibha" knowledge or "arshgyan"
 yah gyaan vishuddh at:karanwale jeev main bhi kabhi kabhi ho jaataa he
 Like - a pious girl says - tomorrow my brothers will come and literally tomorrow their brothers come
 yah "pratibh gyaan" he
 There is no difference of opinion between the two philosophies in the idea of direct and conjecture
 isliye pun: inkaa vichaar yahan nahin kiya gaya
 a very detailed discussion of karma has been done in Vaiseshika philosophy
 nyaay darshan main kahe gaye "karm" ke paanch bhedon ko ye log bhi unheen arthon main sweekaar karte hai
 These people have actually called the physical efforts "karma"
 phir bhi sabhi cheshtaayen praytn ke taratamya hi se hoti hai
 Therefore, in Vaiseshika philosophy, there are some karmas with regard to each of the above five distinctions and the effort in the tradition, which are called "sattrayatya-karma", some are without effort, which are called "aspatriya-karma"
 inke atirikt kuch aise karm hote hai, jaise prithvi aadi mahabhuton main, jo bina kisi praytn ke hote hai, unhen "apratyay-karm" kehete hai
 Looking at all these things, it is clear that there is a very subtle idea of the elements in the Vaisesika faith
 phir bhi sansaarik vishyon main nyaay ke mat main vaisheshik bahut sahamat he
 Therefore, these two are called "monarchies"
 in donon darshanon main jin batoo main "bhed" he, unamem se kuch bhedon kaa pun: ullekh yahan kiya jaataa he
 Both of these types of scriptures are also interrelated, keeping different views in certain principles
 inke anya siddhant paraspar lagu hote hai
 Shivdhanju was Shankar's favorite bow named Pinak
 shivadhanush raja janak ke paas dharohar ke rup main rakhaa gaya tha
 This is the same bow that was placed by King Janaka in Sita Swayamvara
 bhagwaan shriram ne ise tod kar sita ji se vivaah kiya tha The egg is the round or elliptical living thing that is produced by the female of many creatures
 adhikansh jaanwaron ke andon ke upar ek kathor aavaran hota he jo ande kii suraksha karata he
 Although eggs are the way for livestock to produce their offspring, but egg feeding is also useful
 poshak tatwon kii drushti se isamen protein evam choline bharpoor maatra main paye jate hai
 The sparrows' eggs of each species may have some variation, but have their own characteristics
 prayek jati ke pakshiyon ke andon kaa aakaar, maap or rang anoothaa hota he
 There is a correlation in the life, size, shape, surface composition and color of birds
 usee prakaar ek thok yaa samooh ke antargat andon kii sankhya or kisi ritu main thokon kii sankhya main ek sambandh hota he
 The measurement of an egg depends mainly on the dealings of the egg laying bird, but it is not necessary that the ratio is always the same
 iske do kaaran hai : The size of the hen's egg is often the same size as the eggs of other birds
 anda ek disha main lanbaa hota he or uskaa ek chor golakaar or doosraa chor thodaa nukila hota he
 The eggs do not roll easily because they are round at one end and pointed at the other end
 saath saath andon ke nukile bhaag ghonsle ke madhya main kendrit ho jane or unka golakaar bhaag baahar kii ore hone se, yadi ghonsle main teen chaar andey hon to ve sabhi aasaani se ant jate hai
 The eggs of some sparrows are nearly spherical
 ullu ke andey golakaar or bataasi ke andey patale or donon chhoron par gol hote hai
 Some sparrows have smooth surfaces, some have shiny, some have very polished and some have rough and rough
 andon kaa rang bhi bhinn bhinn chidiyon main bhinn-bhinn hota he
 Some sparrows' eggs are white, but some eggs are colored, green, blue, brown, and lacy
 kuch ke andon kaa rang bilkul ek samaan hota he or kuch kaa chitkabara athwa chiththidaar
 The spots are in the form of spots, or rashes, and are small or excessive
 dhabbe andon kii sataha par samaan rup se bikhare ho sakate hai, athwa kisi bhaag main adhik or kisi bhaag main kam
 Some species of birds have individual differences in the color and markings of eggs of different members within the same caste
 andey kaa rang mukhya rup se rakshaatmak hota he
 Therefore, the color of eggs given on green branches is green and the color of eggs given on the ground is often brown
 kotor athwa bill ke andey praaia: safed hote hai, jisase pakshi andhere main bhi unka pataa laga sake
 Gilmatt and Razorbill lay only one egg, two species of Paravat or wild pigeon and Garuda, three different species of Dhomra or Gangchilli and four different species of Tittibha lay four eggs
 anek jatiyaan paanch chah andey tak detii he
 Eggs are found in small rhizomes of some songs from seven to eight to twelve
 shikaar kii kuch chidiyon or batakhon main isse bhi or adhik sankhya pai jaati he
 Most birds, if their eggs are stolen, or destroyed, or they are forced to abandon the eggs, lay eggs again, because every bird has a certain number of eggs
 jab tak yah sankhya puri nahin ho jaati, vah andey dena samaapt nahin karti
 Sparrows usually lay once in a season
 kuch gaanevaali chidiyaan ritukal main do yaa teen baar bhi bachche utpann karti hai
 Sparrows whose eggs and children are more destroyed, or who are young, have a faster reproduction and a greater number of eggs
 chidiyon kii aayu kaa bhi prabhaav unke andon kii sankhya par padataa he
 The first-to-date sparrows lay fewer eggs and the second or third-spawn sparrows lay more eggs
 andon kii sankhya jab puri ho jaati he, tab unka sena prarambh hota hai
 Birds incubate eggs with great dedication, keeping them warm with their wings and protecting them: adhikansh jatiyon main nar or maadaa donon hi andsevan kaa kaary karte hai, bhale hi andey sene kaa kaary ek thodaa karata he to doosraa adhik
 Sometimes the female incubates eggs during the day and the male at night
 kuch jatiyon main keval maadaa hi andey seti hai, kintu aisi avasthaa main nar uske liye bhojan jutata he
 Males and females of any caste continue to come in turn
 anda-seven-kaal main maadaa kaa dhyaan andey sene main kuch aisa lag jaataa he or usamen aisi ekaagratha utpann ho jaati he ki yadi koi uske andey ko hataakar anya koi vastu, jaise pathar ke tukade, rode ityadi, bhi rakh de to vah bina dekhe sune unpar baithkar unhen seti rahegi
 It is often seen that even after the eggs are spoiled or lifeless, the female keeps on incubating them for a long period
 kabutaron main nar bade chaav se anda seta he he
 Not only this, but the female removes herself and sits on the eggs
 nar swayan nahin de saktaa, kintu santanprem kii abhilaashaa se vah kisi tarah maadaa ko rijhaakar joda band letaa he, maadaa se andey dilava letaa he or phir uske baad unke sene tathaa shishupaalan kii sari kriya swayan bade chaav se sampann karata he
 Lapland and Auk species have higher numbers of males, fewer females
 at: sabhi nar joda baandhane main safal nahin ho pate, par unki anda sene tathaa santan paalan kaa abhilaashaa dil se nahin jaati
 In contrast, there are some birds who serve eggs to others rather than themselves
 koyal, papiha aadi inamen mukhya hai, jo chori se apane andey kauwe, charkhi athwa satbhiye aadi ke ghonslon main rakh aate hai or unhen murkh banaakar unase dhatri kaa kaam lete hai
 There are some birds, which neither incubate the eggs themselves nor serve them to others, but cook and protect them from the heat of the sun
 shuturamurg naamak pakshi apni chaati kii ragad se gaddha taiyaar karata he or uske chaaron ore chonch se baaluu rakhkar diwaar si khadi kar letaa he
 Then in this, females, usually 20 to 30, lay eggs
 shaturamurg kii ek hi maadaa nahin hoti, ek nar kii kai patniyaan hoti hai or ye sabhi baari se isamen andey parti jaati hai
 After the laying of the eggs is complete, a small layer of sand is laid on them
 din bhar surya kii kirnon se ye andey garam rahete hai
 In the night, these birds sit on them and provide warmth to them
 kai pakshi aise hai, jo kisi ushn jal ke jharne ke sameep gadhe banaakar unamem andey dete hai, phir unhen dhakkar anyatra chale jate hai
 These eggs keep warm with the hot water of the spring
 samay puraa hone ke din ye lautakar aate hai or upar kii mitti ko hataa dete hai, phir bachche andey phodkar baahar chale aate hai
 Where there is extreme heat, the birds arrange to keep the eggs cold, not warm
 iske liye ve jal main apni chonch bhigo bhigokar unase andon ko bhigote rahete hai, taaki atyadhik taap ke kaaran unhen kshati na pahunche
 Seven times are also different among sparrows
 badi chidiyon main athwa un chidiyon main jinke bachche bhalee bhanti viksit hokar utpann hote hai, sevankaal lanbaa hota he
 In some, the intake period is of one month and in others it is less than two weeks
 kisi kisi pakshi ko maheene andey sete bitate hai
 It takes three weeks for the hen to hatch, four to the pheasant, five to the swan and two to the bird named Candor
 pakshiyon ke andey baahar die jate hai or bhrun kaa vikaas baahar ho andey ke andar hota he
 When the embryo is fully developed, the bird strikes repeatedly with its beak to come out of the egg-like prison and, according to race, in the middle of the egg, or any other wide site, there is a crack and the baby comes out
 Comes
 us samay vah ek taral padaarth se bhigaa hua sa rahata he, jo hawa lagane se sheeghra hi suukh jaataa he
 Children of chicken, pheasant, ostrich etc
 start running as soon as they come out, but babies of parrots, fowls and crows etc
 cannot open their eyes for several days
 ve ek nirih si avasthaa main pade rahete he tathaa hafton tak dhonsle main hi apane shishav ke din bitaate hai
 The first few weeks of the baby bird when coming out of the egg have some special difficulties and dangers
 in dinon vah na keval choti or kamjor hoti hai, balki praaia: swayan bhojan chugane main asamarth tathaa udne se bhi laachaar hoti he
 Infants of different species of birds are born in different conditions and on this basis they can be classified into the following two major categories: nidatyagi shishu kii ankhen janm se hi khuli hoti hai or inkaa sharir mulaayam paron se dhakaa hota he
 They are alert and playful from the beginning and can run or swim
 haan, yadi inhen chhedaa na jaay to janm ke pashchaat kuch ghanton tak ye shant pade rahanaa pasand karenge
 From the very beginning, they begin to feed themselves
 batakh or murgi ke shishu iske achche udhaaharan he
 Among wild birds, babies of tittibhas, hyacinths, ducks and other birds of prey do the same
 shikaar kii chidion main ek or visheshta yah hoti he ki ye sheeghra hi udne bhi lagati hai
 Nesting infants remain in the nest until they grow up after birth and have to depend completely on their parents for food
 ye janm ke samay andhe or asahaay hote hai tathaa adhikansh avasthaaon main kam yaa adhik nange; arthath paraheen evam ankarshak hote hai
 Batkhi, Kilkila; And the children of the green wood are born bare
 jalkaag tathaa bak aise pakshiyon kaa samooh he jinke bachche janmkaal main bilkul nange hote hai, arthath unke sharir par bahut kam par rahete hai
 The bird with which eggs hatch, also nurtures and protects their offspring with the same readiness
 santanraksha main bahudhaa dekha gaya he ki pakshi apane praan kii bhi chintaa nahin karte
 By making various excuses in child protection, these birds also surprise the visitor
 bahudhaa ye use dekhakar is prakaar langadaane lagate hai, maano kisi shikari dwaara ghayal kar die gaye hon
 Enemy hunters, Badikhas, Schwans, Shrigaladi, when they chase them with the hope of catching them, they go out of their way by dodging and then fly away suddenly
 is tarah dushman ko ghonsle se dur le jaakar use pathbhrasht kar dete hai, jisase vah kisi or disha main chal de tathaa need ke shishuon par ai vipadaa is tarah tal jaae
 Sparrows are also very aware of throwing dust in the eyes of others
 jab ve kabhi ghir jaati hai to mritat hokar jameen par let rahati hai, jise dekhanevaala unhen mrit samajhakar aage kii ore bad jaataa he
 Then they leave the ground soon and stand ahead
 kabhi-kabhi pakadi jane par bhi ye mritak hone kaa swaang bharti hai, taaki ham inhen mrit samajhakar chhod de
 Urbanization in India is a post-independence phenomenon in which there has been a rapid increase in the number and size of cities in India as well as the percentage of urban population in the total population
