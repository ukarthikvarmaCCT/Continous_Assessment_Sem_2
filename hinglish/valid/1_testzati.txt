 Modern geomorphology is the study of the divergence of the flow of material on the surface of a planet and is therefore closely associated with sedimentology, which can similarly be seen as the convergence of that flow
 bhu-akritik prakriyaayein vivartaniki, jalwaayu, paristhitiki, or maanav gatividhiyon se prabhavit hoti hai or samaan rup se inamen se kai kaarak dharti kii sataha par chal rahe vikaas se prabhavit ho sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye, isostacy yaa parvatiy varshan ke madhyam se
 Many geomorphologists take particular interest in the possibility of feedback between climate and tectonics that mediate geomorphic processes
 bhu-akruti vigyaan ke vyaavhaarik anuprayog main shaamil he sankat akalan jisamen shaamil he bhuskhalan purvanumaan or shaman, nadi niyantran or punarsthapana or tateey sangrakshan
 With a few notable exceptions, geomorphology is a relatively new science, which has been growing with interest in other aspects of geology since the mid-19th century
 is khand main kuch pramukh akritiyon or unke vikaas kii ghatnaon ke bare main ek sankshipt ruparekha pradaan kii gai he
 The polytheistic Chinese scientist and politician Shen Kuo was perhaps the earliest to discover a theory of geomorphology
 yah prashanth mahaasaagar se saikadon mile kii duuri par ek pahaad ke bhuvaigyanik parat main samudri jeevashm ke khol ke uske avlokan par aadhaarit he
 When he saw the bicolor shell moving in a horizontal extension toward the erosion section of the cliff, he theorized that the reef was once the location of a pre-historic period seaward that moved hundreds of miles over the course of several centuries
 usne nishkarsh nikaala ki vah bhoomi pahaado kii mrudaa kataav or gaad ke jamaav ke kaaran bhinn rup main punargathit hui
 He said this when he saw the strange natural erosion of Taihang Mountains and Yandang Mountains near Wenzhou
 iske alaava, jab usne pracheen ashmibhoot bans ko yanjhau, jo aaj aadhunik samay kaa yaanan, zaansi praant he, ke shushk, uttari jalwaayu kshetra main bhumigat rup se sangrakshit paaya, to usne kai sadiyon ke dauraan kramik jalwaayu parivartan ke siddhant ko prastaavit kiya
 The first use of the term geomorphology was probably in German, when it appeared in Laumann's 1858 works
 kith tinkler kaa suzav he ki jab jon westle pavel or dablue
je
 micgi ne is shabd kaa istemaal 1891 ke antarrashtriya bhuvaigyanik sammelan main kiya to yah angreji, german or french main saamaanya upyog main aa gaya
 An early popular geomorphic model was the geographic cycle or erosion cycle developed by William Morris Davis between 1884 and 1899
 yah chakra ekarupathavaad ke siddhanton se prerit tha jise sarvapratham james haton ne prastaavit kiya tha
 In relation to valley-like shapes, uniformism characterized this cycle in a sequence in which a river cuts a valley as deep as possible, but then the erosion of the side basins eventually recovers the area and reduces elevation Gives, after which regeneration can resume that cycle

 Davis's ideas have largely been surpassed today, mainly because of his lack of predictive ability and qualitative nature, but he remains an extremely important figure in the history of the subject
 1920 ke dashak main, walter penk ne davis ke model kaa ek vaikalpik model viksit kiya, yah maanate hue ki sthalakriti vikaas ko utthan or anaachhadan kii satat prakriyaaon ke bich santulan ke rup main behatar paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, naa ki davis ke ekal utthan ke baad hone vaale kshay ke rup main
 However, due to his untimely death at a relatively young age, the controversy with Davis and the lack of an English translation of his works did not gain widespread recognition for many years
 in lekhakon ne prithvi kii sataha ke vikaas ke adhyayan ko, pehle kii tulana main adhik saamanyakrit, vishwa str par praasangik aadhaar dene kaa prayaas kiya
 In the early 19th century, authors - particularly in Europe - attributed the local climate to landforms, and specifically to glaciation and periglacial processes
 iske vipareet, davis or penk, donon ne hi samay ke saath hone vaale bhudrishy vikaas ke mahatv or alag-alag paristhitiyon main alag-alag bhu-drishyon par prithvi kii satahi prakriyaaon kii saamanyata par jor dene kaa prayaas kiya
 While Pank and Davis and their followers were writing and studying primarily in Western Europe, another, largely segregated school of geomorphology developed in the United States in the mid-20th century

 Modern researchers try to derive quantitative "theories" that govern the Earth's surface processes, but equally, they recognize the specificity of each landscape and environment in which these processes operate
 samakaleen bhu-akruti vigyaan main vishesh mahatvapurn pratiti main shaamil hai: Modern geomorphology focuses on quantitative analysis of interrelated processes

 Most processes that are geologically relevant can be considered either erosive, translational, or a combination of the two
 Deposition processes are mostly considered within the field of sedimentology, but are often understood as part of geomorphology as well
 apkshay, prithvi kii saamagree kaa vayumandaleey yaa sataha ke nazadiiki agenton se sampark ke kaaran hone vaala rasinic or bhautik vighatan he
 The products of these changes near the surface can later be carried away by various factors of erosion

 Other more serious geomorphic processes may include periglacial processes, salt-mediated action, or extraterrestrial effects
 nadiyaan or dharaaen, keval pani kii hi vaahak nahin hai balki talachat kii bhi hai
 Water, when flowing over the surface, is able to use sediments and carry them downstream, either as bottom load or suspended load, or as dissolved load

 Rivers are also capable of eroding new rocks and creating new sediments, by their bottom and coupling with the surrounding mountain slopes
 In this way, rivers are thought to be responsible for establishing the base level for large-scale landscapes in non-glacial environments
 vibhinn bhudrishy tatwon ke sampark main nadiyaan mahatvapurn sutara hai
 When rivers flow through topographies, they generally become larger in size and merge with other rivers

 Eolian processes are related to the movement of air and, more specifically, to the ability of Hava to shape the Earth's surface
 Winds can erode, transport, and deposit things, and these winds are more effective in areas where vegetation is sparse and there is an adequate supply of sediment

 The interaction of organisms with geomorphology or bio-geomorphic processes can occur in many forms and is probably quite important overall for terrestrial geomorphic systems
 jeev vigyaan, kai bhu-akritik prakriyaaon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he, jiskaa kshetra rasinic apkshay ko niyantrit karne vaali jaev bhu-rasinic prakriyaaon se lekar yantric prakriyaaon ke prabhaav tak he jaise mrudaa vikaas par khudaai or tree thro or yahaan tak ki vaishvik apradan dar ko carbon dioxide santulan ke madhyam se jalwaayu kaa aaparivartan karte hue niyantrit karnaa bhi isamen shaamil he
 Terrestrial landscapes that can certainly exclude the role of biology in mediating surface processes are extremely rare, but they can provide important information for understanding the geomorphology of other planets such as Mars Huh

 vipanan ek satat prakriya he jiske antargat marketing mix kii yojana banaai jaati he evam karyanvayan kiya jaataa he
 This process is done to exchange products, services or ideas between individuals and organizations
 vipanan ko ek rachanaatmak udyog ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jisamen shaamil hai vigyaapan, vitaran or bikri iskaa sambandh graahakon kii bhavi aavashyaktaaon or aakankshaon kaa purv vichaar karne se bhi he, jo praayah bazaar shodh ke madhyam se pataa lagaai jaati hai
 Essentially, marketing is the process of creating or directing an organization so that people can successfully sell the product or service that they not only need but are also willing to buy
 isliye acha vipanan is kaabil hona chahie ki vah upabhoktaaon hetu ek "prastaav" yaa laabhon kaa set bana sake, taaki utpaadon yaa sevaaon ke madhyam se graahak ko uske paise kaa mulya adaa kiya ja sake
 Its specialist areas include: parichay a market-focused or consumer-focused organization first decides what its potential customer wants and then creates a product or service
 jab graahak kisi utpaada yaa seva ko zarurat hone par istemaal karata he yaa use koi kathith laabh hasil hota he, to vipanan siddhant or vyavhaar nyyochit mana jaataa he
 There are two major components of marketing - engaging new customers and expanding existing customers and building relationships with them
 Once the seller makes the incoming buyer their customer, Aadhaar management starts
 aadhaar prabandhan ke tahat jo prakriya armbh hoti he usamen vikreta apane graahak ke saath rishte viksit karata he, sambandhon ko poshan detaa he, die ja rahe phaaydon main izafa karata he or apane utpaada / seva ko nirantar behatar banaata he taaki uskaa vyapaar pratispardhiyon se surakshit rahe
 The success of the marketing plan should reflect the mix of 4 Ps to the demands and needs of consumers or the target market
 Convincing a market segment to buy what they do not need is a very expensive job and rarely successful
 vipanak, aupchaarik or anaupchaarik donon tarah ke vipanan anusandhan se praapt jaankaree par nirbhar karte hai or yah tay karte hai kii graahak kya chahta he or uske liye kitna bhugtan karne kaa icchhuk he
 Marketers hope that this process will give them a sustained competitive advantage
 Marketing management is a practical application for this process
 prastaav bhi 4 Ps siddhant kaa ek mahatvapurn ang he
 According to the American Marketing Association, "marketing is a set of organizational functions and processes by which customers are created, communicated with, and provided with utility and relationships with the consumer to benefit the organization and its stakeholders

 "marketing" is an informative business function that informs and educates the target market about the competitive advantage and price of the company and its products
 mulya vah keemat he jo graahak kisi utpaada kaa maalik banane yaa usko istemaal karne ke liye chukaata he
 "competitive advantage" refers to the fact that both the company or its products are doing something better than their competitors to benefit the consumer
 vipanan kaa centre company tathaa utpaada sambandhi suchanaaen nishchit graahakon tak pahunchane par rahata he
 Many decisions are made in marketing work, which information to give, how much information to give, whom to give, how to give and where to give
 ek baar faisle kar liye jaaen to aise kai tareeke or prakriyaayein hai jinhen chuninda ranneetiyon ke samarthan main lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 what is marketing? Chris Newton says marketing is often misunderstood as advertising or sales
 main vipanan ko un sabhi ranneetiyon evam nirnyon ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he jo nimnlikhit baarah kshetro main tay kiye jate hai: The aim of marketing is to create and maintain priority in the target markets for the company and its products
 The intention of any business is to build mutually beneficial and stable relationships with its customers
 Although all areas of business are responsible for achieving this goal, marketing has the highest responsibility
 isaki paribhaasha ko bade daayre main dekha jaae to vipanan kaary teen vishyon ke samanvay se hota he: "utpaada vipanan ", "korporate vipanan " or, "vipanan sanchaar " 
 Strategic Marketing: An attempt to determine how an organization competes with its competitors in the market
 In particular, it aims to take a profitable edge relative to its competitors
 parichaalan sambandhi vipanan: graahakon ko aakarshith karnaa va unhen banaaye rakhana he or unke liye adhik se adhik upyogi hona he
 Simultaneously, to satisfy the customer by prompt services and to meet his expectations
 parichaalan sambandhi vipanan main shaamil hai porter ke paanch balon kaa nirdhaaran In the early 1960s, Professor Neil Borden identified the company's actions at Harvard Business School that could influence a customer's decision to purchase products or services
 borden ne yah sujhaayaa ki company dwaara uthaaye jane vaale ve sabhi kadam "vipanan mishran" hai
 Professor E
 Jerome mccarthy, also from Harvard Business School, suggested in the early 1960s that the marketing mix consisted of 4 elements: product, price, place, and promotion
 aam chalan main "vipanan" utpaada kaa prachaar he, visheshkar vigyaapan or branding kintu, vyavsaayik upyog main iskaa arth vishad he jiskaa matlab he kii vipanan graahak-kendrit he
 Products are developed to meet the needs of a group of customers or in some cases certain customers

 unki tipology ko duniya bhar main itani manyata hasil hui kii unke "chaar P" bhashaa kaa hissaa ban gaye hai
 These four Ps are: ye chaar tatv vipanan mishran, ke taur par jane jate hanjinaka upyog ek vikreta vipanan yojana banane ke liye karata he
 The four p model is most useful in marketing low-cost consumer products
 audyogic utpaadon, sevaaon, ucch mulya ke upabhokta utpaadon ke maamle main is model main samaayojan karnaa padataa he
 Service marketing should be for unmatched services
 Industrial or B2B marketing should be for long-term contracts that are specialized in supply chain matters
 In relationship marketing, marketing is seen in the context of long-term relationships rather than personal behavior
 iske viruddh morgan ne rayeeding da vevs of change, main sujhaayaa ki 4 Ps drushtikon kii ek sabase badi khami yah he kii "yah anjaane main hi bheetar kii ore jor detaa he, jabaki vipanan kaa saar baahar ko ore hona chahie"

 In addition to the already existing four Ps, three additional titles have been added to the marketing of services called the Extended Marketing Mix
 ye hai: a brand is a name, word, design, symbol, or any other feature that distinguishes a product or service from a competitor's offer
 ek brands kisi sanghathan, utpaada yaa seva ke prati upabhokta ke anubhav kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 a brand is also defined as an identifiable entity that promises a specific value
 sah - branding main vipanan gatividhiyaan shaamil hoti hai jisamen do yaa adhik utpaada hote hai
 Pricing refers to the money that is given in exchange for a product
 yah mulya vastu kii upyogita se nirdhaarit hota he kii graahak uske badale main kitne paise or / yaa balidaan dene ko taiyaar he
 Marketing communication creates marketing messages for different categories according to strategy and transmits them to the target
 ajanabiyon ko graahak main parivartit karne ke pruthak charan hote hai jo istemaal kiye jane vaale sanchaar madhyam ko niyantrit karte hai
 An oral presentation by a salesman who approaches an individual or group of potential customers: utpaada kii kharid ko badhaava dene hetu alpakaalik incentive An example of this is a coupon or a sale
 People are encouraged to buy, but this does not build customer confidence nor encourage them to buy again in the future
 vikray vruddhi kii ek badi khami yah he ki pratidwandiyon dwaara ise aasaani se copy kiya ja saktaa he
 Using it, your product cannot always be distinguished from others
 aajkal kai companiyaan apane graahakon par dhyaan kendrit karti hai
 This means that the activities and products of companies are according to the demand of the customers
 aam taur par yah teen tareekon se kiya jaataa he: graahak chaalit drushtikon, bazaar main parivartan ko pahchaanane ki samaj or utpaada ko abhinav banane kaa drushtikon
 Under a consumer driven approach, consumer demands determine strategic marketing decisions
 koi bhi ranneeti tab tak nahin apanaai jaati jab tak kii vah upabhokta anusandhan pareekshan main safal na ho jaae
 ek utpaada kaa har pahalu, jisamen utpaada kii prakruti bhi shaamil he, vah bhavi upabhokta kii zaruuraton se sanchalit hota he
 The starting point is always the consumer
 iske peeche taarkik pahalu yah he kii anusandhan evam vikaas kosh aise utpaada ko taiyaar karne main nahin kharch karnaa chahie jise log khareednaa na chahen
 itihaas gavaah he kii kai utpaada praudyogiki kii anokhi misaal hone ke baavjood bazaar main nahin chale
 The formal approach to this customer-centric marketing is known as SIVA
 In this system, the four Ps have been given new names and new words to focus on the customer
 SIVA model maang / graahak kendrit sanskaran pradaan karata he, jo vipanan prabandhan ke mashhoor 4ps aapurti vaale model kaa vikalp he
 The SIVA model has four elements: is model kaa prastaav checkiton dev or don shultaj ne marketing management jarnal of da american marketing association main diya tha or unhone market leader - da jarnal of da marketing socity in da UK main prastut kiya tha
 This model focuses primarily on the customer navtpaada drushtikon main, company utpaada navachaar kaa anusaran karti he, phir us utpaada hetu bazaar viksit karti he
 Product innovation drives the process and marketing research is done to determine if a profitable market segment exists for that new product
 tark yah he kii shaayad graahakon ko nahin maaloom kii bhavishya main unke paas kya vikalp maujuud honge to hamen yah ummid nahin kerani chahie kii ve hamako bataaen kii ve bhavishya main kya kharidenge
 tathaapi, vipanak aakraamak tareeke se utpaada navachaar ko apana sakate hai or uskaa laabh uthaa sakate hai
 While following the product innovation approach, marketers should decide that they have different and diverse product innovation approaches
 It is claimed that if Thomas Edison relied on marketing research, he would have made larger size wax lights instead of inventing electric bulbs
 Many companies, such as research and development focused companies, successfully focus on product innovation that constantly changes the way VDO games are played)
 Many purity devotees doubt whether this is really a kind of marketing orientation, as the status of consumer research comes later

 The history of scientific studies of metabolism spans many centuries and ranges from the examination of whole animals in early studies, to the investigation of individual metabolic reactions in modern biochemistry
 chayapachay kaa siddhant ebn al-nafis ke samay se he, jisane bataaya ki, ‘sharir or uske bhaag lagaataar vighatan or poshan kii sthiti main rahete hai
 The first experiments of human metabolism were published by Santorio Santorio in 1614 in his book Ars de Statica Medesina
 usne bataaya ki kaise usne apane aapako bhojan karne, sone, kaam karne, maithun, upwas, pine or malatyag karne ke pehle or baad taula
 usne paaya ki uske dwaara liye gaye aahaar kaa adhikansh bhaag ‘asanvedi swedan’ ke jariye gaayab ho gaya
 In these early studies, the methods of these metabolic processes have not been identified and it was believed that some divine force regulates living tissue

 After the discovery of enzymes by Edward Buckner in the early 20th century, chemical reactions of metabolism and biological studies of cells began to be carried out separately and biochemistry began
 In the early 20th century, biochemical information grew rapidly
 The most active of these modern biochemists was Hans Krebs, who made a major contribution to the study of metabolism
 unhone uria chakra or haans carnberg ke saath kaam karte hue, citric acid chakra or glayaxilette chakra kaa avishkaar kiya
 Modern biochemical research has been greatly aided by new techniques such as chromatography, x-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, radioisotopic labeling, electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics simulations

 kalpana kii maansik prakriya ke atanrgat vastav main do prakaar kii maansik prakriyaayein nihit hai – pratham, vigat samvedansheeltaaon kaa pratismaran, bimbon evam vichaaron ke rup arthath smriti, dwitiya, un pratismrit anubhavon kii ek nae sangyojan main rachana
 But in imagination there is so much combination of both these types of actions that neither they can be studied separately nor can they have different distinct sensations
 isi kaaran kalpana ko ek ucchstareey jatil prakaar kii maansik prakriya kaha jaataa he
 The nature of mental processes of imagination and thinking are so similar that in ordinary language they are sometimes used as synonyms
 samanta kii drushti se, donon hi kriyaaon main vigat anubhavon kaa pratismaran tathaa unak nayaa sangyojan taiyaar karnaa he, evam donon kii kriyaayein vyakti kii asantusht aavashyaktaaon or ichchhaaon kii santushti kaa maarg khojane ke liye utpann hoti hai
 But both have different objectives
 kalpana avastavik, ataarkik evam kaalpanik rachanaatmak hal aavashyaktaaon kii santushti ke liye khojati he, chintan kaa uddeshy hameshaa taarkik evam vaastavik hal khojna he or isiilie ise taarkik kriya ke naam se bhi pukaara jaataa he
 The process of contemplation will not begin until a real problem is present in the path of satisfaction of needs
 lekin kalpana avastavik or kaalpanik samasyaon kii upasthiti se bhi prarambh ho sakati he
 Imagination is also divided into two types
 pratham prakaar kii kalpana ke antargat divaswapn or maansik udaanen aati hai jinaki sahaayta se vyakti ek kaalpanik jagat kaa nirmaan karata he, jo vaastavik jagat kii tulana main uski aavashyaktaaon kii santushti ke liye adhik mahatvapurn ho jaataa he
 All ordinary people benefit from this type of imagination and protect themselves from the mental ill effects of their physical inability
 kintu is prakaar kii kalpana kii barambharataa maansik rogiyon kaa ek pradhan lakshan ban jaati he jiske falswaroop vicitra bhramon kaa nirmaan hota he
 The second type of imagination is called the creative name, under which imaginary flights are counted by which literary, artistic scientists, creative works are made
 sarjanaatmak rachanaayen pratibhashali vyakti hi kar pate hai
 Analyzing creative imagination, the genius Helmholts, Pawnbroker, Graham Wallace, etc
, have described its four stages - preparation, elimination, elimination and quantification
 pratham avasthaa main srujankarta vibhinn tathyon tathaa nirikshanon ko ek ekachitr karke apni samasya or uddeshy kii vaastaviktaa kii pariksha karata he
 In the second stage there is no visible progress, but, in fact, the internal thinking of various subconceptions goes on
 sabase mahatvapurn teesri avasthaa hi he jisamen daivi prerana si praapt hoti he or srijan kaary ho jaataa he
 If this creation work is in the form of a scientific sub-concept, then it has to prove its truth and, if it is a literary or artistic creation work, then it has to be personified with its own publication medium
 manovaigyanik rausaman, manake, tathaa plate or baker, ne anusandhankartaaon evam vaigyanikon se, evam si
 patric mahodaya ne kaviyon evam chitrakaaron se jo tathy praapt kiye hai ve sarjanaatmak kalpana kii in chaaron avasthaaon kaa samarthan karte hai
 There are also two types of theories regarding the physical basis of imagination - first, according to the central theory, which is the ancient theory, imagination is based on complex functions of the brain and is a part of it
 doosraa, prerak yaa paridhi siddhant ke naam se prasiddh he jiske anusaar kalpana chunki ek vyavhaar he isliye iske antargat bhi saadhaaran vyavhaar kii hi bhanti gyanendriyon, mastishk tathaa mansapeshiyon kii shareerik kriyaayein hoti hai
 This theory has been supported by various psychological experiments by Jacobson, Max, Sha, Aserinsky, and Kalaimatman, etc
 and this theory is becoming more valid by the day

 nagarikon kii paidal sena prati varsh kii aavashyaktaaon ke anusaar aakaar main badalati hui antatogatva apni lambii seva tathaa sanghathan ke saath ek vetanbhogi sena ke rup main viksit hui
 After that it became the imperial guard of security

 In the end the invasions of the wild cavalry forced the creation of a plains army, which was different from the Border Patrolman army, which consisted of a large number of riders and soon proved to be more important than the infantry
 roman sena pehle paidal sipaahiyon kii sena thi, baad kii avasthaaon main usamen ghudsavaaron kii pramukhataa hui
 This long development continued

 Although there were serious modifications in their meaning, their nature lies in the unchanged system

 The number of the legions varied according to the situation and the army consisted of troops other than civilians, though more often than not they were important

 In the end the Legends became small units, and others and cavalry became the actual battle corps of Rome
 praarambhik roman sena kaa itihaas thik se abhilikhit nahin tathaa praaia: mithyaa kalpanaaon se dooshit bhi he
 We read about the initial corps of three hundred riders and three thousand foot soldiers, in which cavalry was considered almost everything
 kintu yah sankhya spasht rup se kritrim tathaa gazant he
 No mention of prominence given to horsemen is found in the history of North Rome

 Equipped with long ballads and divided into three categories, the soldiers used to form battle lines and attacked in a collective manner and protected the cavalry

 Ancient officials state that Camillus began pay and long service, improved armor and weapons, and created smaller military divisions

 This army defeated the steadfast soldiers of Italy and the mountaineers of Spain respectively and also defeated the trained soldiers of Macedonia

 The reason for its high strength was the superior character of ordinary soldiers, rigorous discipline and high training

 If the two councils combined their armies, they would run this joint force in sequence, with 4 legions, 4200 infantry each, the same number of friends infantry, 1200 legion cavalry and about 3600 allied cavalry , There were 38400 humans in total

 The total number of humans in the battlefield could be increased

 In 225 BC, just before this war, Rome had a total military strength of seven and a half million of which about 65,000 were in the battlefield and 55000 were safe troops in Rome

 Under normal circumstances, the war system was simple
 madhya main rome kii paidal sena khadi hoti thi
 His infantry side consisted of allied infantry, right-left cavalry but sometimes the Roman armies were protected, and the war strikes were left to the Allied forces
 praaia: akraman ek paksh se prarambh hota tha, jaise sijar ne farselas main kiya tha
 At a place called Ilia in Spain, the sepoys surprised their enemies by bringing a last-minute change in their military system
 apni spanish sahaayak senaaon ko madhya main tathaa roman tukadiyon ko bagal main karke, usne centre ko anupranit kar pun: donon pakshon se akraman kiya
 During the last time of the Republic, many changes in the Roman army began to work
 spain main or purv main dirghakaalin videshi yudhon ke kaaran yathesht prabhaav padaa
 In addition, the development of Rome as a prosperous state brought an end to the ancient principle that every citizen was a soldier
 parinamswaroop ab vyapaaree or sena ke bich shramavibhaajan ho gaya
 Also, the increasing complexities of the war required long-term training and professional troops

 The army is now divided into 10 divisions in place of 30 smaller divisions

 Shortly thereafter, the expansion of Roman suffrage to all the Italians also made the subjects of the Allied States and the subject states into citizens
 ek chauthe parivartan ne lijanri ghudsavaaron ko samaapt kar diya or sahaayak sena ko bahut badha diya
 The evils of the imperialist army-civil wars of security provided the first emperor Augustus the need and opportunity for the reform of the army
 20 varsh se avyavashtha bani hui thi, at: rajbhakti tathaa vyavastha samaan rup se pun:sthapit karnaa aavashyak tha
 Just as Agastus did all his work by following the old things, so did he
 phir bhi is kathan main satyata he ki uske sainya sudhaar uske mahanatam tathaa sabase adhik moulik kaary hai
 The army of the empire now became two categories or Vargovali, which were almost equal in number but unequal in importance
 pratham varg kii vah sena thi jisamen roman naagarik, chaahe ve italy ke nivasee the yaa praanton ke, bhartee kiye jate the
 The second category was composed of auxiliary forces, in which subjects of the empire were recruited
 rome main vishesh prakaar kii gharelu tukadiyaan bhi thim or visiles yaa prahariyon kaa ek bahut bada dal tha jo fire brigade or police donon kaa kaam karata tha
 If this system of legions and auxiliary forces was unique in the early days of the empire, their use was no less unique
 baad ke ganatantr main vishaal samrik sena dikhaai padati he, yadhyapi vishesh pradeshon ke liye vishesh lijan kii vyavastha kii pravriti kaa bhi abhas hota he, kintu yah pravriti bahut ksheen he
 Augustus ended the era of a large tactical army that could not afford such weapons for future contenders of the throne
 nishchit seemaa ke bheetar samrajya ko rakhte hue usne ek duusari pravriti viksit kii
 That policy was completely correct in the military situation at that time
 praarambhik roman samrajya ko aadhunik samrajyon kii tarah samaan shatru ke saath yuddh sankat or apni puri rashtriya sena ko yuddh karne ke liye pravrutt karne kii aavashyaktaa kaa saamana nahin karnaa padaa
 From the time of Augustus till 250 AD, there was no enemy of Rome who feared invasion
 sudurpurv main avashya uske baraabar shaktishaalee tathaa uske liye ghaatak ek rajya parthia tha par vah usapar hamalaa karne ke yogya nahin tha
 Elsewhere, his borders were surrounded by more or less wild vulgarities, which, although often painful, could not cause serious damage
 inkaa saamana karne ke liye do yaa ek chhavniyon main kendrit drudh sena kii aisi koi aavashyaktaa nahin thi balki prayek seemaa par bahut se bikhare hue durgrakshakon kii aavashyaktaa thi jinke nikat thode se majboot kile hon jo in durgrakshakon ke liye sainik centre ke rup main kaary kar saken
 Accordingly, an arrangement was fixed at the time of Augustus and his successors, whereby the whole army was divided into permanent garrisons on the borders or especially in disorganized districts
 vaastavik simaaon par tathaa unase milanevaale rajmargon par mukhya senaaon ke divijan or sahaayak sainik tukadiyaan apane teen se saat acre vistaarwali chaukiyon kii raksha karte hue sthit the
 25 Legion soldiers were stationed in 50, 60 acres of small fortifications just behind the borders or even on the borders

 The result was that a long border from the German Ocean to the Krishna Ocean to Britain and Europe, and to the upper Euphrates Valley and Tunisia Algeria and the south Sahara suburbs of Morocco, was guarded by guards, but rarely a single soldier was seen within the vast empire
 do pramukh kaarnon ne augustus kii sena main kramash: parivartan kiya
 First, the peace of the Roman Empire brought such prosperity in many districts that a sufficient amount of soldiers stopped getting from those districts
 bharat main angrejon kii bhanti romanon ko bhi asabhy bhaagon tathaa apni simaaon ke baahar bhi adhikadhik dhyaan dena padaa
 Hence, in the second century and after that a new class of foreign troops arrived which used their national weapons and warfare like the initial auxiliary troops
 adhik se adhik gaiyr-roman tatv sena main dekh padane lage
 This trend became very clear in the third century and it had serious consequences at the end
 duusari baat yah hui ki keval seemaa raksha ke puraane din samaapt ho gaye
 From 160 AD, the wild people started attacking the borders of the empire

 In addition, they came on horseback, which led to the Roman infantry facing new armaments

 Its results were seen in the reforms of Diocletian and Constantine Greats
 nae simaprahari sthapit kiye gaye or pracheen sena yusena ke rup main pun: sangathit hui jo yuddh ke samay samrat ke saath prayaag karti thi yaa kar sakati thi
 The importance of the legions decreased
 pramukh sipaahi vetanbhogi the jo adhiktar german the or asabhy logon main se bhartee kiye gaye the
 Now new posts were created and it became clear that the system is not old in many things
 is vyavastha ke vistrut vivaran utane hi jatil hai jitne is yug ke prashasnic dhaanche
 Neither do we find any central organization within the republic and we should really hope to find one who is specially entrusted with the development of military system or military finance or wartime military policy
 phir samrajya ke bheetar bhi is tarah kaa koi sanghathan nahin tha
 The emperors, of course, as commanders and their more or less non-governmental advisors used to decide questions of policy
 kintu sena pradeshik senaaon kaa aisa samooh thi ki prayek pradesh main pramukh adhikariyon ke upar bahut kuch chhod diya jaataa tha
 Like other parts of the empire here too, if not for self-government, we can at least see the love for constant change
 rome main ek kendriya vitt karyaalay tha
 Whose task was to provide financial assistance to the job-torn soldiers, it was established by Augustus in 6 AD and a tax of 5 percent was paid on the will, 1 percent on sales for its income

 Ginkgo, which also has the English spelling gingko, also known as the Maidenhair tree, based on the Adiantum, is a unique species of tree that has no close living relatives

 This is one of the best known examples of living fossils, because G
 Ginkgoels other than biloba have not been known from the fossil record since the Pliocene

 However, recent studies have indicated signs of high genetic homogeneity among ginkgo trees of these regions, which is against the argument of the natural origin of these populations and suggests that ginkgo trees in these areas may have been reported by Chinese monks for 1,000 years

 Leaves with long shoots are usually toothed or segmented, but only from the outer surface between the veins
 They thrive in both places, one at the tip of the more rapidly growing branch, where they are one by one at the farthest distance, and the other at the small, stubby lump seedlings, where they are in clusters at the tip

 The former name was adopted directly into Vietnamese

 The scientific name Ginkgo appears to be due to a process akin to folk etymology

 Engelbert Kempfar, the first Westerner to see the species for the first time in 1960, wrote this pronunciation in his Ammonites exoticae; His y was incorrectly read g and this misspelling remained

 The most reliable ancestral group of the genus Gingoels is Teridospermatophyta, also known as the "seed fern", specifically the order Pelataspermellus
 The closest surviving relatives of this clade are Cicad, who is the current G

 Shares the motif of the dynamic sperm with biloba

 As the Cretaceous grew it began to decrease in diversity and by the Paleocene, Ginko adientoides was the only Ginkgo left in the Northern Hemisphere, while a distinctly distinct form remained in the Southern Hemisphere

 Therefore, Ginkgo exhibits an "ecological paradox" because while it has the properties of living in a turbulent environment, many other properties of its life-history are in contrast to those properties that appear in modern trees that thrive in a turbulent environment
