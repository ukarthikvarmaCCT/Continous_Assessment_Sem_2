in / search / label / hindi%20anuwaad Wilhelm II or William II was the last emperor of Germany and king of Prussia who ruled the German Empire and Prussia from 15 June 1888 to 9 November 1918
 wiliam pratham kii mrityu ke uparant uskaa putr fadrik tritiy germany ke rajsinghaasana par 9 march 1888 i
 ko asin hua
 But he died after ruling only 100 days
 uski mrityu hone par uskaa putr wiliam dwitiya rajya singhaasana par asin hua
 He was a young man
 usamen anek gunon or durgunon kaa sammishran tha
 He was sharp-witted, ambitious, confident and an extraordinary young man
 vah swaarthee or ghamandi tha tathaa uskaa vishwaas raja ke daivi siddhant main tha
 It was unbearable for him to be in control of any other person, due to which he became estranged from his Chancellor Bismarck after a few days
 paristhitiyon se baadhya hokar bismark ko tyaag-patr dena padaa
 After the fall of Bismarck, William took all power into his own hands and his ministers became obedient servants and he became the helm of his own rule
 wiliam kaisar atyadhik hathi, mahatvakankshi evam krodhi vyakti tha
 He used to say that our future depends on the sea
 uske germany ko samudri shakti banane ke prayaas ne england kii sthaayee shatruta praapt kar lee thi
 His policy was- 'to establish his dominion over the whole world
 ' yadi isamen use safalataa na mili to vah vishwa ke sarvanaash ke liye tatpar tha
 England was not in favor of war as a trading country, which William Kaiser considered England's cowardice
 vah akramak ruukh apanaakaar england ko bhaybheet kar apane samrajya kaa vistaar karnaa chahta tha or yah galat samaj thi ki england kisi bhi keemat par yuddh taalna chahega
 Thus William Caesar's fiery, imperialist, autocratic and autocratic personality put Europe on the brink of a great war
 kaisar wiliam dwitiya kii vishwa niti ke nimnlikhit teen mukhya uddeshy the - In order to fulfill the above objectives, Kaiser William II began to conduct Germany's 'foreign policy'
 pratham uddeshy ke kaaran austria ke saath ghanisht mail aavashyak tha, kyonki vah bhi usee disha main bad kar selonika ke bandargah par adhikaar karnaa chahta tha
 This meant strengthening the diplomatic group of Central Europe
 austria or rus ke hiton main sangharsh hone ke kaaran iskaa arth rus se alag hatana or ant main use apana virdohi bana lenaa bhi tha
 The fulfillment of the second objective meant 'to demonstrate the power of Germany wherever necessary in the world, especially in Africa
 ' is sambandh main morocco ne france ko do baar 1905 i
 or 1911 i
 main chunauti di
 a clear result of the fulfillment of the third objective was intense competition and disharmony with England
 saransh main is nai niti kaa swaabhaavik parinaam hona tha, rus, france or england kii shatruta or ant main in teenon kaa uske mukaable main ekatrit ho janaa, arthath bismark ke samast kaary kaa vinaash
 William II destroyed his entire system with his policy
 teen varsh ke andar rus germany se alag ho gaya or baad main france se sandhi karke usne uske ekaakipan kaa ant kar diya
 England became an enemy within 6 years
 morocco main hastkshep karne sefrance se shatruta or bad gai or 1907 i
 tak germany, austria tathaa italy ke trigut ke mukaable main france, rus or england kii trirashtra maitri sthapit ho gai
 Italy's relationship with threesome was also getting relaxed, but William II did not make any effort in this direction
 1890 i
 main punaraashwaasan sandhi kii punrariti hone vaali thi jo bismark dwaara germany or rus main hui thi, jabaki wiliam rus kii apeksha austria se sudrudh sambandh sthapit karnaa chahta tha jissevah balkan main hokar purvi bumadhyasaagar ko apane prabhaav kshetra main laane main safal ho sake
 Russia, too, refused the reiteration of this repatriation treaty, stating that 'the treaty is very complex and there is a threat to Austria, which can have disastrous consequences
 ' The apparent consequence of the non-recurrence of the Treaty of Resettlement was that Russia remained alone
 usko apane ekaakipan ko dur karne ke liye ek mitra kii khoj kerani anivaary ho gai
 Now England and France were his enemies in front of him
 kintu apni paristhiti se baadhya hokar vah france se mitrataa karne kii ore aakarshith hua or usase mitrataa karne kaa praytn karne laga
 Finally, in 1895 AD, the treaty took place in both the countries, which is known as the Dwight Treaty
 is sandhi se france ko atyadhik laabh hua or uskaa akelaapan samaapt ho gaya
 William was very ambitious
 vah germany ko europe kaa bhagya-nirmaataa hi nahin, varan vishwa kaa bhagya-nirmaataa bananaa chahta tha
 Bismarck wanted to keep Germany apart from world conflicts, but William started interfering in conflicts outside of Europe
 vah keval balkan prayadweep main hi german-prabhaav se santusht nahin tha, varan vah to usko vishwa-shakti ke rup main dekhnachahta tha
 For this purpose, world-wide policy was incorporated into Germany's foreign policy after 1890 AD
 wiliam ke anek bhaashanon se uske in vichaaron kaa digdarshan hota he
 He gave these territories in his possession - wiliam turki ko apane prabhaav-kshetra ke antargat laana chahta tha or yah uski vishwa niti kaa ek pramukh ang tha
 England was also trying in this direction
 vah kisi europea raashtra kaa prabhutv turki main sthapit nahin hone dena chahta tha, kyonki aisa hone se uske bhartiya samrajya ko bhay utpann ho saktaa tha
 England was dominated by Turkey until the berlin-congress of 1878, and whenever a European nation thought of making progress towards it, England strongly opposed it, but after the Cyprus agreement, its influence would be less than on Turkey
 felt
 jab england kaa 1882 i
 main misr par adhikaar hua to england or turki ke madhya jo rahi-sahi sadbhaavna vidyaman thi uskaa bhi ant hona aarambh ho gaya
 Now William II took advantage of this situation and tried to bring Turkey into his sphere of influence
 is sambandh main usne nimna upaay kiye- There was also the construction of a rail till Kustuntunia
 is maarg ke khul jane se germany kaa sampark faras kii khadi tak ho jaataa jo england ke bhartiya samrajya ke liye vishesh chintaa kaa vishay ban jaataa
 William must have succeeded in attracting Turkey, but by this policy he made Russia, France and England his enemy, while the power of Turkey was negligible in front of these three big nations
 wiliam kii is niti ko safal niti nahin kaha ja saktaa
 He unhappy the three nations together, as a result of which it was possible to form a three-party faction
 1890 i
 tak germany or england ke sambandh achche the, kintu jab wiliam dwitiya ke shasankaal main germany ne vishwavyaapee niti ko apnaanaa aarambh kiya to germany or england ke sambandh katu honearambh ho gayi
 After Bismarck's resignation, William began to expand in the German navy, England became increasingly suspicious of Germany's growing power
 kuch samay takadonon main maitri kaa haath badha, kintu 1896 i
 ke uparaant donon ke sambandh katu hone aarambh hote gayi
 When William sent a telegram of congratulations to the President of Transvaal, Kruger, conquering James's invasion
 is taar se england kii janata main bada kshebh utpann hua
 Queen Victoria also strongly condemned this work of her grandson William II
 is samay england ne germany se sambandh bigaadna uchit nahin samajha, kyonki aisa karne par vah akelaa rah jaataa
 For this purpose, he tried to establish good relations with Germany
 1898 i
 main africa ke sambandh main tathaa 1899 i
 main senaaon ke sambandh main donon deshon ke samjhaute bhi hue
 In the same year, Joseph Chamberlain, the colonization minister of England, proposed the construction of a ternary in England, Germany and the United States, but in 1899, Beulo, who was then Prime Minister of Germany, did not accept the proposal
 uskaa is prastaav ke asweekaar karne kaa kaaran yah tha ki iske dwaara england kaa aashay yah he ki aagaamee yudhon main germany, england kaa paksh le or uske samarthak ke rup main yuddh main bhaag le or england europea mahadweep se nishcint hokar asia tathaa africa main apane samrajya kaa vistaar karata rahe
 Beulo was of the view that inconvenience to England was inevitable due to Germany's colonial, mercantilist and navigational advancement and could lead to war at both times
 atah germany kii nitiyon dwaara england bhalee prakaar samaj gaya ki germany par adhik vishwaas karnaa england ke liye ghaatak siddh hoga or vastav main ek din aisa avashya aayega jab england or germany kaa yuddh hoga
 Friendship between France and Russia had been established, now the work of friendship between Russia and England started by France
 1907 i
 main france ke praytn se rus or england kaa gut taiyaar ho gaya
 This group was defensive, but the German Emperor William II was concerned about its creation
 ab usne apana dhyaan is gut ke ant karne kii ore vishesh rup se aakarshith kiya
 At the same time, Germany had the opportunity to intervene in the eastern problem and humiliate Russia
 1908 i 
 turki main ek aandolan hua jo yuva turk aandolan ke naam se prasiddh he
 Austria soon took possession of Bosnia and Herzegovina
 srbija yah sahan nahin kar sakaa or usne yuddh kii taiyaari karnaa aarambh kar diya
 He hoped that Russia and England would be ready to help him against Austria and Germany, but Russia did not yet have such a situation
 austria ne srbija ke saath bada kathor vyavhaar kiya jiske kaaran yuddh kaa hona anivaary sa dikhne laga, kintu jab germany ne spasht ghoshnaa kar di ki yadi rus srbija kii kisi prakaar se sahaayta karegaa, to vah yuddh main austria kii purna rup se sahaayta karne ko taiyaar he
 Thus the war was averted
 is samay rus main itani shakti nahin thi ki vah germany or austria kii sammilit sevaaon kaa safaltaapurvak saamana kar saktaa
 Russia was forced to subdue and German politics succeeded in the Balkan Peninsula
 yadhyapi german-samraat wiliam kaisar balkan pradesh main rus ko nicha dikhalaane main safal hua or vah apane mitra austria kii shakti kaa vistaar tathaa prabhaav main vruddhi karvaa sakaa, kintu phir bhi vah france, rus or england ke gut se bhaybheet bana rahaa
 He began to move towards befriending France and Russia
 8 farvari 1909 i
 ko usne france se ek samjhauta kiya jiske anusaar france ne morocco kii swatantraaa evam akhandta ke siddhant ko sweekaar kar liya
 Germany accepted France's extraordinary position regarding Morocco's internal security
 idhar nishcint hokar germany ne apana dhyaan rus se samjhauta karne kii ore aakarshith kiya
 Germany signed an agreement with Russia in November 1910 regarding its interests in Mesopotamia and Persia, by which 'russia pledged not to oppose the berlin-baghdad railway plan to Germany, and William acknowledged Russia's interests in Persia
 Of
 ' By the above works, William II succeeded in weakening the faction of Russia, France and England, but this situation could not be sustained for long
 morocco ke prashn kaa samaadhaan karne kaa praytn france or germany dwaara kiya gaya tha, kintu donon samjhaute kii sthiti se santusht nahin the
 There was a natural opposition to the 'independence of Morocco' and the French police power, which was sure to cause a quarrel in the future
 france morocco ko purnataya apane adhikaar main laane par tula hua tha or germany use rokane yaa uske badale main upyukt puraskaar praapt karne par katibaddh tha
 1911 AD In Morocco, an incident occurred which attracted the attention of the major nations of Europe
 morocco main grihayuddh kii agni prajjwalit hui or morocco kaa sultan is vidroh kaa daman karne main asafal rahaa
 After this situation arose, France sent an army, pretending to be responsible for internal security, which started suppressing the rebellion in Morocco on 21 May 1910 AD
 germany france ke is prakaar ke hastkshep ko sahan nahin kar sakaa or germany ke videshmantri ne ghoshnaa kii ki 'yadi france ko morocco main rahanaa aavashyak prathit hua to morocco kii purna samasya par punah vichaar kiya jaayegaa or eljisiraj ke act par hastakshar karne vaali samast sattaaon ko apni icchaanusaar kaary karne kii swatantraaa punah praapt ho jaayegi
 After the suppression of the foreigners, the French forces returned, but even then Germany did not think it necessary to make any changes in its strict behavior
 july 1910 i
 ko germany ne ghoshnaa kii ki usne german hiton tathaa german nivaasiyon kii raksha ke abhipraay se ek jangi jahaaj dakshini morocco ke agedir naamak bandargah par bhej diya
 This behavior of Germany created a very critical situation and it became clear that the possibility of war between the nations of Europe was inevitable soon
 ant main france or german ke madhya sandhi ho gai jo ki 4 navambar 1911 ko sampann hui, jiske anusaar yah nishchay hua ki morocco par france kaa sangrakshan purvawat bana rahe or germany ko french congon kaa aadha pradesh praapt hua
 Germany had to face the question of Morocco, because the three-nation faction of Russia, France and England was now more firm and stable than before and relations between Germany and England started getting worse day by day

 The Directive Principles of State Policy are the latest elements of democratic constitutional development
 sarvapratham ye ireland ke samvidhan me lagu kiye gayi the
 These are the elements which have developed with the development of the Constitution
 in tatwon kaa kaary ek janakalyankari rajya kii sthapana karnaa he
 The Directive Principles of State Policy have been incorporated from Articles 36 to 51 of the Constitution of India

 According to Article 37, these elements cannot be applied in any court, these elements are not legal and have political form and only have moral rights
 ve na to koi vaidhanik baadhyataa hi rajya pe lagu karte he na janata hetu adhikaar kartavya
 They are just such general instructions for the state that the state should do such things which will be beneficial for the people of the state

 In 1951, the Supreme Court ruled that the elements were essentially subordinate to the fundamental rights
 Chamar Durai Rajan suit would not give priority to fundamental rights in case of a dispute, but when the state legislature started the abolition of zamindari
 In order to give effect to the Directive Principles of Article 39B, the Supreme Court recognized the importance of these elements and in Kameshwar Singh Vs
 From 1952 till 1957, the Supreme Court accepted that the Directive Principles of Policy cannot prevail on Fundamental Rights, but later the Court laid down the Harmony Principle and tried for collaborative development and tried to make both of them more effective
 As much as was possible
 hormoni siddhant dono ke madhya koi sangharsh nahi maan kar dono ko ek duusare kaa poorak maanata he
 According to this theory, if two interpretations are possible that balance the Directive Principles with the Fundamental Right, the second interpretation should be disputed in them, then the court should give priority to the first interpretation over the second interpretation if only one interpretation is possible and which policy - If there is a conflict between the rights, then the court is bound to abolish the 'privy purse' and give priority to the rights over the policy directors
 The Nationalization Act, which was brought for the compliance of Article 39 'B' and 'S', was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court for violation of fundamental rights, Parliament passed the 25th Amendment 1971 in response to this and Article 31 Gave birth to s which states that if a law is passed which gives effect to the Directive Principles of 39 b and in this process if paragraph 14, 19, anu 31 sa ke anusaar koi vidhi jo anu 39 ba sa ko prabhavi karti he kisi bhi nyaayalay me parakshit nahi kii ja sakegi
 This amendment was challenged in the Keshavanand Bharti suit

 This amendment was challenged in Minerva Mill vs Union of India suit in 1980, in which the Supreme Court declared the new amendment to Article 31 non-constitutional as it distorted the balance of parts 3 and 4 of the Constitution

 Hyperplasia or overgrowth is a general term that refers to the growth of cells within an organ or tissue beyond which it is normally seen
 hyperplasia ke parinamswaroop kisi ang kii ati vruddhi ho sakati he evam is shabd ko kabhi-kabhi susadhy nioplasia / susadhy tumor ke saath mishrit kiya jaataa he
 Hyperplasia is a common pre-neoplastic response to stimulation
 sookshmdarshi rup se koshikaayen saamaanya koshikaon ke samaan hoti hai lekin ve sankhyaon main badi hui hoti hai
 Sometimes cells may also have increased in size
 hyperplasia, ativruddhi se is arth main bhinn hoti he ki ativruddhi main anukool koshika parivartan ke rup main koshika ke aakaar main parivartan hota he, jabaki hyperplasia main koshikaon kii sankhya main vruddhi hoti he
 Hyperplasia is considered a physiological response to a specific stimulus, and cells with an underdeveloped growth remain under normal regulatory control systems
 yah nioplasia ke vipareet hoti he, jisamen anuvaanshik rup se asaamaanya koshikaayen gaiyr-shaareerik rup se prachur maatra main utpann hoti hai or saamaanya udyipan ke prati pratikriya nahin darshaati hai
 As seen in the examples below, such physiological multiplicity of cells may actually be a result of a secondary pathological factor
 phir bhi, nioplasia ke vipareet, bahujnan apane aap main kisi anya asaamaanya sthiti ke prati ek saamaanya pratikriya he, jabaki bahujnan apane aap main asaamaanya hota he
 Hyperplasia can occur for a variety of reasons, including increased demand, chronic inflammatory response, unnatural hormonal actions, or compensation for damage or illness occurring anywhere
 Hyperplasia may be harmless and may appear in a particular tissue

 In contrast, overgrowth is, for example, an increase in skeletal muscle cells and only in cell size during weight training and steroid use
 ai ji epa-1 ke upyog dwaara aap hyperplasia utpann sakate hai jo vastav main mansapeshiyon ke utakon main maujuud koshikaon kii sankhya main hone vaali vruddhi he
 These new cells can be matured in size and strength by weight training with or without the use of anabolic steroids
 iske alaava, pashu pareekshanon se pataa chalaa he ki ek mansapeshi ko khinchne se hyperplasia shuru ho saktaa he, haalanki maanav main is ghatana kii abhi tak pushti nahin kii ja saki he
 Hyperplasia can also be induced through specialized strength production training for athletic performance, thus increasing muscle fibers rather than increasing the size of a single fiber
 hyperplasia asaamaanya rup se bhi utpann ho saktaa he evam yah vibhinn rog-vishyak bimariyon se sambandhit hota he
 Some common clinical forms of hyperplasia or, conditions that cause hyperplasia are as follows: Cell death: Necrosis · Apoptosis · Pyknosis · Karyorrhexis · Karyolysis Cellular adaptation: Atrophy · Hypertrophy · Hyperplasia · Dysplasia · Metaplasia bijandasana yaa aparaa vah ang he jiske dwaara garbhashay main sthit bhrun ke sharir main mata ke rakt kaa poshan pahunchataa rahata he or jisase bhrun kii vruddhi hoti he
 This organ is the link between the body of the mother and the fetus

 When the impregnated egg enters the uterus from the oviduct, it makes a place for it to reside in the epithelium or endometrium, which has formed anew in the previous menstrual secretion
 vah ant:str ko khodakar usamen ghus jaataa he
 In this activity, some blood vessels of the inner layer burst and the blood coming out of them collects around the impregnated egg and hence a thin layer of level is also covered above the egg
 ab dimb kii vruddhi hone lagati he
 He keeps taking nutrition from the blood that is gathered around him

 On the other hand, sprouts also come out from the open part below the ovary of the uterus
 bhrun ke or badhane par uske upar ke aachhadit bhaag ke ankur lupt ho jate hai or keval ant:str kii ore ke ankur rah jate hai
 The capillaries of the blood vessels are also formed in these shoots, which are separated from the inner capillaries by only one membrane
 ant main yah jhilli bhi lupt ho jaati he or mata or bhrun ke rakt ke bich main keval raktakeshikaon kii sookshm diwaar rah jaati he, jiske dwaara mata ke rakt se oxigen or poshan visaran or rasakarshan kii bhautik kriyaaon se bhrun ke rakt main chale jate hai or bhrun ke sharir main rasinic kriyaaon dwaara utpatr hui carbon diaksaide tathaa anya tyajya padaarth mata ke rakt main chale aate hai
 Anuradha and Ankur Nayak are real brothers and sisters
 purna bijandasana 22 semi lambaa hota he
 It is about 2 to 2
5 cm thick, flattened, circular in circumference; But near the periphery, where it joins the epithelium of the uterus, it is thin
 uskaa bhaar lagbhag 500 gram hota he
 The relationship between the mother and fetus sprouts is disconnected due to the hesitancy in the uterine flesh during delivery
 maansasutron ke sankoch se garbhashay ke ankuron kii raktavahikaaon ke munh band ho jate hai, isse unase rakt nahin nikalataa, kintu bijandasanavaale ankur kii vahiniyon ke munh khule rahane se kuch rakt nikalakar prasav main baahar aata he
 In this way, Bijandasana is a part of the baby's importance and life
 vah bhrun ke phuffus kii bhanti shwasan kaa karm karata he
 Oxygen of the mother's blood reaches the fetus through it; bhrun ke sharir main utpann hui carbon diaksaide tathaa bhrun ke chayapachay se utpann hue anya antim tyajya padaarth mata ke rakt main bijandasana dwaara laut jate hai
 Thus he performs the deed of emission; bhrun main mata ke rakt se poshak avyavon ke pahunchaane kaa kaam isi ang kaa he
 Therefore, he also nourishes; vah avarohak kaa bhi kaam karata he; rogon ke parashrayi jeevon tathaa bahut se vishon ko mata ke rakt se bhrun main nahin jane detaa tathaa In Bijandasana, an endocrine juice or hormone is also formed, which gives rise to the fetus

 Tiredness is both mental and physical and both types of relaxation thakaavat dur hoti he
 Energy required in all the essential activities of life such as cardiovascular, respiratory activity, muscle contraction, etc
, in walking and speaking, vision work by the muscles of the eyes and physical exertion, such as hammer, digging, lifting weights, running, etc
 It falls
 mansapeshiyon kii dakshata adarsh dasha main 40% se adhik nahin hoti he
 It is less in humans
 khilaadi kii yantric kshamta praaia: 20% se 30% hi hoti he
 In this activity, the demand for and burning of sugars and oxygen provided by the tissues for energy is increased, for which the heart rate and respiratory activity are speeded up with the aim of giving more blood and more oxygen
 isse sharir kii ooshmaa bad jaati he tathaa lactic amla evam carbon dioxide ko kramash: gurda tathaa shwasochvas dwaara baahar nikaal phenkaa jaataa he
 When muscle contraction occurs repeatedly, then the person starts feeling tired
 yadi vidyut uttejan dwaara mansapeshi main sankunchan kriya kii jaae, to sankunchan dhire dhire kam hota jayega tathaa ant main anukriya nahin hogi
 After stopping the stimulation for some time, the muscle will become healthy by relaxation and the contraction properties will come back
 thakaavat kii avasthaa se mukt hone ke liye oxigen aavashyak he
 The more tired a man is, the more time he will have the ability to work
 yadi apekshaakrit kam vishram ke baad kaary kiya jaae, to iske falswaroop badi badi durghatnaayen ho sakati hai, jaise thakaa motorchaalak durghatana adhik karata he, kyonki vah aavashyaktaa padane par, yaa sanket ke anusaar, prabal vegavaale vaahan ko rokane main jahaan ek se do second lagaataa he, vahaan thakaavat kii avasthaa main kai second laga degaa tathaa us kaal main prabal vegavaala vaahan bahut aage bad jayega, jisase durghatana ho sakati he
 Due to the above reasons, mental and physical relaxation is required
 yadi maansik vishram nahin hoga, to manushya main thakaavat ke kaaran santulan tathaa sphurti nahin rahegi
 It is generally seen that after a lot of exhaustion, there is a deep sleep, which does not show tiredness on waking up and one experiences rejuvenation and cheerfulness
 par yadi puraa vishram na mili, yaa nidra main vighn pad jaae, tab vyakti ko thakaan, aalasy tathaa shaktilop kaa anubhav hota he tathaa manan or samajhane kii maansik shakti main avyavashtha pai jaati he
 Animals also need rest and sleep after work, which gives them the power to work again

 maheshwar sutara ko sanskrit vyakaran kaa aadhaar mana jaataa he
 In order to refine and regularize the present form of Sanskrit language, Panini incorporated various components and components of the language such as phonetics, name, designation, verb, prefix, prefix, sentence, gender, etc
 and their interrelations in the Ashtadhyayi
 is
 ashtaadhi main 32 paad hai jo aath adhyyon me samaan rup se vibhakt hai In this important book of grammar, Panini has given a comprehensive and thorough discussion of the huge collection of the divisive-dominated Sanskrit language in about 4000 sutras, which are divided into eight chapters
 tatkaaleen samaaj me lekhan saamagree kii dushprapyata ko dhyaan main rakhte hue panini ne vyakaran ko smritigamya banane ke liye sutara style kii sahaayta lee he
 Again, Panini has used many tools from his predecessor grammar as well as himself, to make the discussion very brief, of which the Shivasutra or Maheshwar Sutras are the most important
 maheshwar sutron kii utpatti bhagwaan nataraj ke dwaara kiye gayi tandav nrity se maani gayi he
 That is to say, "on the expiration of the dance, Nataraj played the damper nine times for the attainment and fulfillment of the wishes of the Sanakadi sages
 is prakaar chaudaa shivasutron kaa ye jaal prakat huyi
 " damru ke chaudaa baar bajaane se chaudaa sutron ke rup main dhvaniyaan nikali, inhen dhvaniyon se vyakaran kaa prakaatya hua
 That is why Lord Nataraja, the originator of grammar formulas, is considered
 prasiddhi he ki maharishi panini ne in sutron ko devadhidev shiv ke aashirwad se praapt kiya jo ki panineey sanskrit vyakaran kaa aadhaar bana
 The total number of Maheshwar Sutras is 14 which are as follows: 1

 Light uparyuktt 14 sutron main sanskrit bhashaa ke varnon ko ek vishisht prakaar se sanyojit kiya gaya he
 As a result, whenever Pāिini needs to use any particular group of characters in the interpretation of words or rules, they take those letters from the Maheshwar Sutras in an abbreviated form
 maheshwar sutron ko isi kaaran ‘pratyaahaar vidhayak’ sutara bhi kehete hai
 His method of making pratihar and his multiple uses in Sanskrit grammar is further shown
 in 14 sutron main sanskrit bhashaa ke samast varnon ko samavesh kiya gaya he
 In the first 4 sutras, vowel characters and remaining 10 sutra consonant characters are counted
 sankshep main swar varnon ko ach evam vyanjan varnon ko hal kaha jaataa he
 Good and light are also pratyahar
 pratyaahaar kaa arth hota he – sankshipt kathan
 Panini has instructed the method of making pratyahara by the 'adirantyen Saheta' sutra, the 71st formula of the first foot of the first chapter of Ashtadhyayi
 adirantyen saheta : aadi varna antim it varna ke saath milakar pratyaahaar banaata he jo aadi varna evam itsanjyak antim varna ke purv aae hue varnon kaa samshti rup main bodh karaata he
 Example: Ach = Aa Pratihar is made by using the initial letter 'A' of the first Maheshwar Sutra 'aiun' with the last letter 'A' of the fourth sutra 'aiuch'
 yah ach pratyaahaar apane aadi akshar ‘a’ se lekar itsanjyak ch ke purv aane vaale ou paryant sabhi aksharon kaa bodh karaata he
 Hence, ach = a i u ri e i o ou
 Similarly, the attainment of light pratyahar is achieved by mixing the initial letter of the 5th sutra hayavart with the last letter of the 14th sutra hal
 faltah, In all the above 14 sutras, Panini has given the last letter as it
 it sangya hone se in antim varnon kaa upyog pratyaahaar banane ke liye keval anubandh hetu kiya jaataa he, lekin vyakaraniya prakriya me inaki gananaa nahi kii jaati he arthath inkaa prayog nahi hota he

 According to Alan E
 Norse's body book, these islets "tirelessly build their hormones and usually ignore the surrounding pancreatic cells, as if they are in a completely different part of the body
 " When the endocrine pancreas leaks hormones into the blood, the exocrine pancreas produces a digestive fermenter and an alkaline liquid pancreatic juice in response to the hormones secretion and cholistocyanin and leaks into the pancreas via the exocrine vessel
 pachak kinvakon main tripsin, chimotripsin, agnyashayi lypes va agnyashayi emiles shaamil hai or inkaa utpaadan or risaav bahibasravi agnyashay kii gucchhik koshikaon dwaara hota he
 The lining of the pancreatic vessels is made up of certain cells, called centrocyanar cells, and they leak the rich solution of bicarbonate and salts into the ileum

 There are three famous poets in Hindi named 'thakur' - Asniwale Puranik Thakur, Asniwale 2nd Thakur and 3rd Thakur Bundelkhandi
 sankhya main teen hone ke kaaran ye 'thakuratrayee' bhi kehalaae
 The first two of these were Brahmabhatta, a resident of Thakur Asni

 Only his footbal poems written in clean and moving language are found scattered in poetry collections like 'kalidas Hazara' etc
 vaise teenon thakuron kii rachanaayen paraspar itani ghul mil gai hai ki sahaj rup se unamem antar kar paanaa kaaphi kathin he
 Asniwale was the son of the second Thakur Rishinath Kavi and according to his grandson Kavi Sevak's nephew Sri Krishna, his ancestor poet Devakinandan Mishra was a Saryupari Brahmin Piyasi Mishra of Gorakhpur, who had to be castigated as a poet in his marriage to the king of Majhauli

 As a poet, he came in this lineage
 thakur kaa janm, ramanaresh treepathi ke anusaar, san0 1792 main hua tha
 Babu Devkinandan Thakur, a well-known nobleman of Kashi and a relative of Kashiraj, was the patron of the poet whose beloved poet made 'bihari Satsai' as 'devakinandan Tika', 'satasai Baranarth'
 unki kavita main bhav or bhashaagat laalitya, chamatkaar or sarasata dekhne yogya hoti he
 Sukumar Bhavabyanjana, enchanting rhetoric and uninterrupted visualism are the main qualities of the second Thakur's poem
 tisare bundelkhandi thakur reetikalin reetiyukt bhav-dhara ke vishisht or premi kavi the jinka janm orchhe main san0 1823 or dehavsaan san0 1880 ke lagbhag mana gaya he

 Thakur was a resident poet of Jaitpur and a local court poet of Kesari Singh

 Sankavi Prasad, son and grandson of Dariyav Singh 'chatur' Thakur, was also a poet

 The King of Bijawar honored him by giving him a village
 singhasanacin hone par raja kesarisingh ke putr parichaat ne thakur ko apni sabha kaa ek ratna banaaya
 Thakur was also to be visited equally by Himmat Bahadur Gosain of Banda, who was among Padmakar's chief refugees

 Thakur by nature was a free-spirited, capricious, fearless, forthright, self-respecting, aesthetic, passionate, 'fiery opponent and sympathetic to allies', generous and visionary of wisdom, skillful, approachable, and well-recognized of the pace of the nation
 
 darbari hote hue bhi unhone kisi ashrayadata kii atiranjit prashansa kabhi nahin kii
 Beginning with the words 'servant soldier', the poet presents a good tableau of the poet's inner nature which Thakur read with a sword drawn in a gathering to answer the courage of Himmat Bahadur
 kavy main saras, sachche or umang bhare anubhoot bhavchitran ke kaayal hone ke kaaran thakur reetibaddh kaviyon kii paramparayukta kavy-srijan kii ratant paripati se utane hi chidhate the jitne gorakhpanthiyon or kabirpanthiyon se tulsidas
 The poem ending with 'logan Kavitta Kivo Khelo Kari Jaano Hai' is a direct evidence of the said statement and a poignant sarcasm of the poet's anger, reprimand and recessive decadent poetry of that period
 bahut dinon tak anek pracheen kavyasangrahon main thakur kii rachanaayen sfoot rup main hi dikhti raheen parantu kaaphi baad main 'thakur shatak' or 'thakur thasak' naam ke do sangrah taiyaar kiye gaye
 The 'thakur Centenary', comprising poems of the three Thakurs, was the poet of Nakhedi Tiwari, resident of Dumraon, and whose publication was published in 1904 AD under the direction of Babu Ramakrishna Varma 'veer' from Kashi's 'bharat Jeevan Press'

 This simple and immaculate sentiment is found everywhere in his poems
 kala kaa aagrah puri tarah se sweekaar karte hue bhi bhavakshetra main ve swatantraaa ke pakshpaati the
 The poet also had unique language with a sense of life and unique expressions
 yadhyapi thakur ke kavy kaa varnya vishay bhi ritimargi kaviyon kii bhanti shringaar, bhakthi or niti hi he tathaapi prayog kaa prakaar usase paryaapt bhinn he
 Even after adopting the 'cult of love', the poet did not get involved in heroism
 saamaanya vyavhaar kii chalati hui brajabhasha kaa prayog hi usne kiya he
 Artificial language style, Sukumar is sufficiently capable of emotional expression
 lokokti, muhaavarey or lokprachlit tadbhav shabdon kaa jaisaa yuktiyukt or sateek upyog is kavi ne kiya he vaisaa anya kisi ne nahin
 This has made the expression natural, charming, lively and euphemistic
 savaiya chand main kavi kii sahaj gati thi jiskaa spasht prabhaav bhaaratendu par padaa tha
 Due to these characteristics, many critics have praised the poetry of the poet and wrote - 'premishikas such truthful and stereotypical verses are often not found in the composition of any poet
 is mahakavi ne maanushiya prakruti or hridyangam bhaavon evam chitasagar kii tarangon ko badi hi safaltaapurvak chitrit kiya he'

 Rama is the seventh incarnation of Vishnu in the ten incarnations of Hinduism

 Goswami Tulsidas also composed the devotional well-known epic Sri Ramcharitmanas centered on his life
 in donon ke atirikt anya bhartiya bhashaaon main bhi ramayana kii rachanaaen hui hai, jo kaaphi prasiddh bhi hai
 Ram is highly revered and an ideal man, especially in North India
 inhen purushottam shabd se bhi alankrita kiya jaataa he
 Rama was the eldest son of King Dasharatha and Queen Kaushalya of Ayodhya
 ram kii patni kaa naam sita tha or inke teen bhai the- lakshmana, bharat or shatrughna
 Hanuman is considered to be the biggest devotee of Lord Rama
 ram ne lanka ke raja ravan kaa vadh kiya
 Rama has a reputation as Maryada Purushottam
 ram ne maryaada ke paalan ke liye rajya, mitra, mata-pita, yahan tak ki patni kaa bhi saath choda
 His family represents the ideal Indian family
 ram raghukul main janme the, jisaki parampara praan jaahun baru bachanu na jaai kii thi
 Sri Ram's father Dasharatha had pledged his step-mother Kaikeyi to fulfill any of his two wishes
 kaikeyi ne daasi manthra ke bahekaave main aakar in varon ke rup main raja dasharath se apane putr bharat ke liye ayodhya kaa rajsinghaasana or ram ke liye chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas maanga
 Rama happily accepted fourteen years of exile to protect his father's word
 patni sita ne adarsh patni kaa udhaaharan dete hue pati ke saath van janaa uchit samajha
 Bhai Laxman also spent fourteen years in the forest with Rama
 bharat ne nyaay ke liye mata kaa aadesh thukraayaa or bade bhai ram ke paas van jaakar unki charanpaduka le aae
 Then put it on the throne and ruled it
 jab ram vanavaasi the tabhi unki patni sita ko ravan haran kar le gaya
 In the forest, Rama found a friend and devotee like Hanuman who completed all of Rama's work

 Reached Lanka by building a bridge over the sea and fought with Ravana

 He ruled very well, that's why people still give good governance as the kingdom of Ram Rajya

 Many festivals of Hinduism, such as Dussehra, Ram Navami and Deepawali, are associated with the life story of Rama
 'ram' dhaatu main 'ghan' pratyay ke yoga se 'ram' shabd nishpann hota he
 The meaning of 'rama' metal is related to Raman
 ve pranimaatr ke hriday main 'raman' karte hai, isliye 'ram' hai tathaa bhaktajan unamem 'raman' karte hai, isliye bhi ve 'ram' hai
 In his commentary on 'vishnusahsrnama', Adya Shankaracharya has quoted Padmapuran saying that Yogijans do Ramana in God, so they are 'rama'
 vaidic sahitya main 'ram' kaa ullekh prachlit rup main nahin miltaa he
 The word 'rama' is used only at two places in the Rigveda
 unamem se bhi ek jagah kaale rang ke arth main tathaa shesh ek jagah hi vyakti ke arth main prayog hua he; lekin vahaan bhi unke avtari purush yaa dasharath-putr hone kaa koi sanket nahin he
 Although Neelkanth Chaturdhar has chosen many of the mantras of the Rigveda in his own discretion, he has his own Ramakathapak meaning, but this is his personal belief
 swayan rugveda ke un prakarnon main praapt kisi sanket yaa kisi anya bhashyakaar ke dwaara un mantron kaa ramakthaparak arth siddh nahin ho paaya he
 In the Rigveda, 'ikshvakuh' is used at one place and the word 'dasharatha' is also used at one place
 parantu unke ram se sambaddh hone kaa koi sanket nahin mil paata he
 The word 'rama' is used in Brahmin literature at two sites in Aitareya Brahmana; But there he is called 'ramo Margaveyaah', which according to Acharya Sayan is the son of a woman named 'mrigavu'
 shatapath brahman main ek sthal par 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 Here 'rama' is as the Acharya of Yajna and he is called 'rama Aupatapasvini'
 taatpary yah ki prachlit ram kaa avtari rup valmikiy ramayana evam puraanon kii hi dein he
 The following description is available in relation to the birth of Rama in the most authentic scripture Adikavya Valmiki Ramayana related to Ramakatha: xxrep 22 
 chaitre navamike tithu
 
 nakshatreditidaivatye swocchsanstheshu panchasu
 Bhreeshu karkte lagne vakpavatinduna co
 
 That is, in the Navami Tithi of Chaitra month, in Punarvasu Nakshatra, when the five planets are in their high position and the position of Jupiter with the Moon in Cancer Ascendant
 yahan keval brihaspati tathaa chandramaa kii sthiti spasht hoti he
 Jupiter is exalted and the moon is self-possessed
 aage pandrahaven shloke main surya ke ucch hone kaa ullekh he
 In this way, Jupiter and Sun are known to be high
 budh hameshaa surya ke paas hi rahata he
 Therefore, it is impossible for Buddha to be high when the Sun is high
 is prakaar ucch hone ke liye bachate hai shesh teen grah -- mangal, shukr tathaa shani
 For this reason, almost all scholars have considered the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn to be high in the time of Rama's birth
 paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm treta yug main mana jaataa he
 According to the data available in Hindu theology, especially in mythological literature, a Chaturyugi has 43,20,000 years, of which Kaliyuga has 4,32,000 years and Dwapara 8,64,000 years
 ram kaa janm treta yug main arthath dwapar se pehle hua tha
 Since Kali Yuga has just begun and Rama was born at the end of Treta and the time of his present living on earth with an avatar has traditionally been considered as 11,000 years
 atah dwapar yug ke 8,64,000 varsh + ram kii vartmaanta ke 11,000 varsh + dwapar yug ke ant se abtak beete 5,100 varsh = kul 8,80,100 varsh
 Hence traditionally Rama's birth is considered to be about 8,80,100 years ago
 prakhyat marathi shodhakarta vidwaan dow0 padmakar vishnu vartak ne ek drushti se is samay ko sambhavya mana he
 They say that the height of Vindhyachal and Himalayas at one place in the Valmiki Ramayana is said to be the same
 vindhyachal kii oonchaai 5,000 feet he tathaa yah praayah sthir he, jabaki himalay kii oonchaai vartmaan main 29,029 feet he tathaa yah nirantar vardhansheel he
 The height difference between the two is 24,029 feet
 visheshgyon kii manyata ke anusaar himalay 100 varsho main 3 feet badhata he
 Therefore, it would have taken the Himalayas about 8,01,000 years to grow 24,029 feet
 atah abhi se kareeb 8,01,000 varsh pehle himalay kii oonchaai vindhyachal ke samaan rahi hogi, jiskaa ullekh valmikiy ramayana main vartmaankalik rup main hua he
 In this way Dr
 Vartak finds this time possible from a point of view, but he himself believes that he cannot confirm this time from any other source
 apane suvikhyath granth 'vastav ramayana' main dow0 vartak ne mukhyatah grahagatiyon ke aadhaar par ganit karke valmikiy ramayana main ullikhit grahasthiti ke anusaar ram kii vaastavik janm-tithi 4 disambar 7323 isapurv ko sunishchit kiya he
 According to him, Rama must have been born on this date between 1:30 to 3:00 pm
 dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak ke shodh ke anek varshon ke baad 'ai-sarv' ke ek shodh dal ne 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog karke shri ram kaa janm 10 janvari 5114 isapurv main siddh kiya
 He believed that the planets had the same position on this date as described in the Valmiki Ramayana
 parantu yah samay kaaphi sandehaaspad ho gaya he
 The 'planetarium Gold' software used by the research team of 'i-serve' is not really capable of doing true planetary mathematics before 3000 BC
 vastutah 2013 isvi se pehle itane pehle kaa grah-ganit karne hetu sakasham software uplabdh hi nahin tha
 Saturn was in Scorpio in the planetary position attained by this calculation, ie it was not in high
 chandramaa punarvasu nakshatra main na hokar pushya ke dwitiya charan main hi tha tathaa tithi bhi ashtami hi thi
 Later in the correct calculation done by ejplde431 software by another expert, the date becomes Navami but Saturn comes in Scorpio and in the fourth phase of Moon Pushya
 atah 10 janvari 5114 isapurv kii tithi vastutah shriram kii janm-tithi siddh nahin ho paati he
 In such a situation, if the date already refined by Dr
 p
v
vartak is certified by the software, then only the real time of Shri Ram will be able to be universally accepted or in case of not being certified, the path of research of new date will be opened

 Rama was a brave man of quiet nature since childhood
 unhone maryaadaaon ko hameshaa sarvocch sthaan diya tha
 For this reason, he is known as Maryada Purushottam Rama
 unka rajya nyaaypriy or khushhaal mana jaataa tha
 So whenever there is talk of Suraj in India, the example of Ramraj or Ramrajya is given

 The Videha king Janak organized a swayamvar ceremony for the marriage of his daughter Sita
 jahaan bhagwaan shiv kaa ek dhanush tha jisaki pratyancha chadhaane vaale shoorveer se sita kaa vivaah kiya janaa tha
 Many kings Maharaja attended that ceremony

 In an attempt to raise his reputation, he broke down while uttering a great bow

 He was particularly popular due to his soft-hearted, public-oriented spirit and justice
 raja dasharath vanprastha kii ore agrasar ho rahe the
 Hence, he thought of handing over the kingdom to Rama

 At that time Rama's other two brothers Bharata and Shatrughna had gone to their maternal aunt Kaikeya
 kaikeyi kii daasi manthra ne kaikeyi ko bharamaaya ki raja tumhaare saath galat kar rahen he
 If you are the beloved queen of the king then your child should become the king, but King Dasharatha wants Ram to be the king
 ram ke bachapan kii vistaar-purvak vivaran swami tulsidas kii ramcharitamanas ke balkand se milti he
 King Dasharatha had three queens: Kaushalya, Sumitra and Kaikeyi
 ram kaushalya ke putr the, sumitra ke do putr, lakshmana or shatrughna the or kaikeyi ke putr bharat the
 With the state rules, only the eldest son of a king is eligible to become a king, so Rama was sure to become the king of Ayodhya
 kaikeyi jinhone do baar dasharath kii jaan bachaai thi or dasharath ne unhen yah var diya tha ki wo jivan ke kisi bhi pal unase do var maang sakati he
 Kaikeyi wanted Rama to be king as Raja becoming king and looking to the future, so he granted Rama 14 years of exile by King Dasharatha and demanded the kingdom of Ayodhya for his son Bharata
 vachanon main bande raja dasharath ko majabuuran yah sweekaar karnaa padaa
 Rama obeyed his father's orders
 ram kii patni sita or unke bhai lakshmana bhi vanvaas gayi the
 At the time of exile, Ravana killed Sita
 ravan ek rakshas tathaa lanka kaa raja tha
 According to the Ramayana, Sita got distraught after hearing the voice of a deer when Rama, Sita and Lakshmana were in the hut
 vah hiran ravan kaa mamaa marich tha
 He made a golden deer form at the behest of Ravana
 sita use dekh kar mohit ho gai or shriram se us hiran kaa shikaar karne kaa anurodh kiya
 Shri Ram started to fulfill his Indian desire and asked Lakshmana to protect Sita
 Maricha takes Sri Ram too far
 mauka milte hi shriram ne tir chalaaya or hiran bane marich kaa vadh kiya
 While dying, Marich shouted "O Sita! o Laxman!" Made a sound of Sita got worried after hearing that voice and she asked Lakshmana to go to Shri Ram
 Laxman did not want to go, but could not deny his sister-in-law
 lakshmana ne jane se pehle ek rekha khinchi, jo lakshmana rekha ke naam se prasiddh he
 Rama, along with his brother Lakshmana, wandered in search of Sita
 tab ve hanuman or sugriv naamak do vaanron se mili
 Hanuman became the biggest devotee of Rama
 sita ko ko punah praapt karne ke liye bhagwan ram ne hanuman, vibhishana or vanar sena kii madad se raawan ke sabhi bandhu-baandhvon or uske vanshajon ko parajeet kiya tathaa lautate samay vibhishana ko lanka kaa raja banaakar achche shaasha ke liye maargdarshan kiya
 When Lord Rama defeated Ravana in battle and made his younger brother Vibhishan the king of Lanka

 After meeting everyone there, Rama and Sita were crowned in Ayodhya

 However, the modern turbine did not develop until the Industrial Revolution took place

 But, when electricity was generated, generators started being used in factories
 Now, if we talk about the working of turbine, it works on the basis of Newton's third law of motion

 This is how the propeller of the turbine works

 This pressure causes the propeller to push the turbine backwards, causing it to move

 To understand briefly how the kinetic energy of the potential energy contained in a water sign changes, imagine that a stream of water is falling from a tank at some height into the reservoir below it

 jab bhikisi sthaan par jal ke pravaah athwa varchas dwaara praapt urja kii sahaayta se koi jalchaalit motor yaa tarabine chalaakar shakti unpaadan karne kaa vichaar kiyajata he, to uske pehle aas paas main sthit jalarashi athwa jalsroton se praapt hone vaali urja kaa yathasadhay sahi anumaan laga liya jaataa he
 Classification of hydraulic motors - This classification is as follows: ye chakra jaldhara ke pravaah main rukaawat daalane par holevaale prabhaav athwa chakra kii dolchiyon main bhare pani ke bhaar ke kaaran chalaa karte hai
 They are driven by the kinetic energy of a highly moving base of water coming out of a nozzle
 is prakaar ke aavegchakron kaa vahiin upyog hota he jahaan par pani kii maatra to simit hoti he lekin uskaa dabaav atyaadhik hota he
 In this, both the kinetic energy and pressure of water are used
 ye vahiin lagaae jate hai jahaan paristhitiyaan aavegchakra tathaa aaveg tarabinoke liye bataai paristhitiyon se vipareet hoti hai, arthath jahaan pani alp oonchaai yukt hote hue bhi vipul maatra main praapt ho saktaa he
 The height of this water can be from 5 to 500 feet
 jaldhara ke pravaah tathaa gurutvkarshan se paidaa urja se chalanevaale chakron kaa upyog to ab dehaton main kutir udyogon ke upyukt hi samajha jaataa he, pahari sthanon par jahaan nirantar jharne behate rahete hai
 In this type of chakras, the downstream, ponsley diaphragm and upstream chakras are predominant, but they are considered completely unsuitable for large amounts of electrocution, yet as auxiliary motors, bade bijligharon main, urdhvapravahee chakra kaa upyog, aavashyaktaa padane par, aadhunik sanyantron ke saath kiya jaataa he
 The efficiency is only about 25 per cent, in which a lot of water energy is wasted
 1,800 i0 tak iskaa upyog bahut hota tha
 It is a sophisticated form of the semipolar cycle
 isaki pankhudiyaan is prakaar se modakar golaaidaar banaai jaati hai ki inamen pani bina jhatka maare hi pravesh kar jaataa he or unamem se baahar nikalate samay vah chakra kii paridhi kii sparsharekhiy disha main hokar hi nikalataa he, jise chakra ko adhik aaveg praapt ho jaataa he or chakra kii kaaryakshmata lagbhag dugani ho jaati he
 This is also the refined form of the inflow cycle
 isaki konianuma pankhudiyon main pani, chakra kii dhuree ke tal se kuch oonchaai par sthit pankhudiyon main bharna aarambh hota he or unke neeche aane tak unhon main bharaa rahata he
 The shell of the cycle also helps in keeping this water filled with them, so this cycle rotates mainly due to the weight of water
 madhyapravahee chakra bhi do prakaar ke hote hai
 One is called the mid-flow and the other is called the mid-flow
 isaki pankhudiyon main pani dhuree ke tal se kuch neeche kii pankhudiyon main bharna aarambh hota he, jisamen pani ke bhaar or pravaahajanit, donon prakaar kii, urjaaon kaa upyog hota he
 The efficiency of these chakras can range from 50 per cent to 80 per cent, depending on their texture and size
 inkaa prayog 19veen shatabdi ke madhya tak hota tha urdhv pravaahee chakra - Its efficiency ranges from 70 percent to 85 percent, which is almost equivalent to modern water turbines
 It is a relatively modern type of gravitational energized water cycle, which is still used today as an auxiliary motor to generate small amounts of electricity
 Is and gives good work
 aadhunik prakaar ke aaveg chakra ponsle ke ad:pravaahee chakra ke parishkrut rup hai
 In these, the trusses are used in place of the sluice route, of which the water stream rises from the big baig and collides with the petals of the wheel
 is dhang ke jis sanyantr kaa sarvaadhik prachaar he vahpelton chakra ke naam se prasiddh he, main uski ek dolchi tathaa pani kii dhar kaa aarekh he
 The dolchi is made as two twin cups in such a way that the water stream explodes as soon as it collides in the middle, splitting into two, moving at an angle of about 180 degrees from each other
 yadi ye donon uppradharaen apni mul pradhara se bilkul vipareet disha main bah nikle to avashya hi peltan chakra kii kaaryakshmata 100 prati shat ho jaay, lekin inhen jaan boojhkar tirachha karke nikaala jaataa he, jisase ye apane pasavali dolchi se takaraayen nahin
 By doing this, some energy is wasted in friction, due to which the efficiency of this cycle remains about 80 percent
 isamen chihnit maarg se pani pravisht hota he or tonti se chakra par lage pankh par padataa hai
 When entering, the velocity of water is much higher than when exiting
 at: baahar kii taraf unka rasta kramash: chaudaa kar diya jaataa he
 In the United States, this turbine is manufactured under the name 'victor High Pressure Turbine', with efficiency ranging from 70 percent to 80 percent, according to its design and size
 == pratikriya tarabine == - aavegchakra main to pani kii gatyaatmak urja hi kaam karti he, lekin abhikriyaatmak chakra main gayaatmak tathaa daabajanit donon hi prakaar kii urjaayen sammilit rup se kaam karti hai
 Reactive turbines can be divided into the following four main classes according to the direction of water flow: 1
 Radial outflow, 2
 Radial inflow, 3
 Axial flow and 4
 Alloys

 It has a central axle, which is related to dynamo etc
 yah traigy bahirpravahee tarabine kaa namoona he
 Axial flow turbine of Juval - whose initial components are the same as the predefined turbine diagram
 isamen pani kaa pravaah, jaisaa banchihnon dwaara pradarshit kiya gaya he, aksh ke samaantar hi rahata he
 It was designed by a well-known American engineer named JB Francis
 isamen pha chihnit tontiyon main se pani baahar kii ore se traigy disha main pravisht hokar, bheetar kii ore centre ke nikat ghoomanevaale pankhons ko dhakelkar chalaata hua, neeche ko dhuree ke chaaron taraf hota hua, baahar nikal jaataa he
 Run cycles of turbines - tarabinon kaa ghoomanevaala chakra jisaki paridhi par dolchiyaan athwa pankh lage hote hai, dhaavak kehalaata he
 This is the main component of turbines, whose efficiency and strength depend on the fine texture and balance
 do prakaar ko tarabine praaia: adhik kaam aati hai, ek to traigrant:pravaahee pratikriyaatmak or duusari aavegatmak
 The first type is the spinning wheel of the Francis turbine, which is suitable for dominated waters ranging from 100 to 500 feet
 aavashyaktaa padane par 600 foot varchas ke jal kaa bhi inke saath upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 For impulsive turbines, Pelton has a double-barreled whirlwind, whose ellipses have elliptical surfaces and the outer edges are slightly cut
 inamen pani kii pradhar bina jhatka maare inhen dhakelkat bilkul saaf baahar nikal jaati he or kate kinare ke kaaran chaalu karte samay pradhar kii shakti vicchhinn nahi hone paati
 The ability of the rushes is tested by their characteristic movements
 yadi ham kisi dhavanchakra kii vibhinn naapon ko itnaa chota tathaa sankuchit karte jaayan ki vah ek foot varchas ke jal se itane chakkar prati minute lagane lage ki usase ek ashwashakti mil jaae to chakkaron kii us sankhya ko us chakra kii lakshanik chaal kehete hai, jo nimnlikhit sutara dwaara vyakt kii jaati he : What should be the diameter of the runaway wheel for a particular turwine can be determined by the following formula: vyas inchon main In this sutra b = in supreme feet; c = Speed of the wheel, round per minute

 Sophisticated forms of hydropower motors are still used in rural areas to produce small amounts of power
 inke ekahare chakra kaa vyas 60 foot tak bana diya jaataa he tathaa uski chaudaai itani rakhi jaati he ki vah 3,000 ghan foot pani prati minute se chalaa sake
 They run at a sufficiently slow speed, so they are made of whole steel sheets and rolled rods
 chakron kii bhitari paridhiyon par daante bana die jate hai, jinase ek taraf laga hua chota dantachakr ghumkar apane se sambandhit dhuree dwaara yantron ko chalaata he
 The instruments are often not operated from their central main axle, because the torsion force on them causes too much fear of their release
 peltan ke tonti kii banaavat, isamen lage ek suchyakaar valve ke spindal ko chaukor chudiyon ke dwaara haathchakari se aage peeche sarkaakar tonti kaa munh kam yaa zyada kholkar, pani kii pradhar ko niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 It can also be operated by the controlling device, which will be described further
 peltan ke aavegchakra prayogshaala ke chote upkarnon se lekar 18,000 ashwashakti utpaadan yogya kai maapon main banaae jate hai
 == == Dynamic Turbine - == iske dhavanchakra dhale lohe kii kholon main feet karke inke pani kaa maargdarshan karne vaale guide is prakaar kii chulon par lagaae jate hai ki unke tirchhepan kaa samaayojan karke tarawine kii chaal par bhi niyantran rakhaa ja sakat he
 With this, the wishbone can be applied as per the convenience of both the sides or standing
 gatiniyantrak yantra - a controlling device for hydraulic motors consisting of two balls on a sample of ordinary watt governor
 ise pradhan chakra ke dhure par lage ek fatti dwaara chalaaya jaataa he
 As the speed of the wheel accelerates, when the balls rise up due to centrifugal force, its sleeve is related to a clutch between the weave gears, rotating the spidle on the left-hand side in the image, a worm on the tip of the worm By rotating, one rotates the biceps slightly, causing the corresponding dental lashing to move
 isi dantadand se sambandhit chhed yukt ek valve bhi thodaa sarak kar pani ke maarg ko aavashyaktaanusaar avaruddh kar detaa he
 When the speed of the water cycle slows down, due to its opposite action, the related valve opens the water passage, or main valve, in greater quantity
 bade tarabinon ke liye tel ke daab se kaam karne vaala niyantrak yantra hota he
 In this picture upwards, a box marked a has a centrifugal type of ferocious speed controller

 Rakhmabai Raut was the first woman doctor of India
 vah ek aitihaasik kanoonee maamle ke centre main bhi thim, jiske parinamswaroop 'age of concent act, 1891' naamak kanoon bana
 She was married to grandfather grandfather Bhikaji, then nineteen, when she was only eleven years old
 vah haalanki apni vidhwaa mata jayantibai ke ghar main rahati rahi, jinhone tab sahaayak sarjan sakhaaraam arjuna se vivaah kiya
 When Grandpa and his family asked Rukhmabai to go to their home, they refused and her stepfather supported her decision
 isane 1884 se adaalat ke maamalon kii ek lambii shrinkhalaa chali, bal vivaah or mahilaon ke adhikaron par ek badi saarvajanik charchaa hui
 Rukhmabai continued her studies during this period and wrote letters to a newspaper in the name of a Hindu woman
 uske is maamle main kai logon kaa samarthan praapt hua or jab us ne apni doctori kii padhai kii ichha vyakt kii to landan skool of medicin main bhejne or padhai ke liye ek fund taiyaar kiya gaya
 She graduated and returned to India in 1895, becoming one of India's first female doctors, and worked in a women's hospital in Surat

 The atmosphere of Dhuramji's house put Dadaji in a life of laziness and loafing
 dharmaji ke ghar main ek rakhel thi or unki patni ne aatmahatya kaa prayaas kiya
 Rukhmabai refused to stay with Dadaji at the age of twelve at Dharmaji's house and Sakharam Arjun supported her decision
 march 1884 main, dadaji ne apane vakeelon chaak or vaakar ke madhyam se ek patr bheja, jisase sakhaaraam arjuna ko rukhmabai ko usase judane se rokna band kar dene ke liye kaha
 Sakharam Arjun replied through civil letters that he was not stopping him, but soon he too was forced to seek legal aid
 pyne, gilbert or sayaani vakeelon ke madhyam se, rukhmabai ne dadaji se judane se inkaar karne ke liye aadhaar pradaan kiya
 Grandpa claims that Rukhmabai was being kept away because she could assert her father's property rights
 dadaji bhikaaji banaam rukhmabai, 1885 ko bhikaaji ke "vaivaahik adhikaron kii punarsthapana" maangane ke saath sunwaayee ke liye aayaa tha or nyaay nyaayadhish robert hill pinhe ne nirnay paarit kiya gaya tha
 Pinhe stated that the English examples on restitution do not apply here because the English law was to be applied to agreed mature adults
 angreji kanoon ke maamalon main kami thi or hindu kanoon main koi misaal nahin mili
 He announced that Rukhmabai had been married in her "helpless childhood" and that he could not force a young woman

 kirtikar haalanki dadaji ke samarthan main tha
 The public debate goes on about many points of dispute - Hindu versus English law, reform from outside versus inside, whether or not the ancient custom should be respected and so on
 pehle maamle ke khilaaf 18 march 1886 ko ek apil kii gai thi or ise mukhya nyaayadhish sar charles sargent or justise ferran ne barkaraar rakhaa tha
 On 4 February 1887, Justice Farran handled the case through interpretations of Hindu laws and went the other direction and Rukhmabai was ordered to live with her husband or face imprisonment for six months
 rukhmabai ne bahaduree se likhaa ki vah is faisle kaa paalan karne ke bajaay adhiktam dand bhugtegi
 This led to further turmoil and debate
 baalgangdhar tilak ne kesari main likhaa tha ki rukhmabai kii avagya ek angreji shiksha kaa parinaam tha or ghoshit kiya ki hindu dharm khatre main he
 Max Müller wrote that the legal path was not a solution to the problem shown in Rukhmabai's case and that it was Rukhmabai's education that made him the best judge of his choices
 har jagah yah bhagwaan kii sabase badi aashishon main se ek mana jaataa he ki ham apni pyaari rani victoria kii sarkaar kii suraksha main hai, jisaki behtareen prashasan ke liye isaki vishwa bhar main prasiddhi he
 If such a government cannot help us liberate a Hindu woman, then what government on earth has the power to free India's daughters from the present miseries? The Jubilee is the 50th year of our queen's most prestigious throne, wherein every city and every village is under her dominion to show her loyalty in the best way possible, and wish the mother queen a very happy life, Rule us with peace and prosperity and for many years

 In July 1888, an agreement was reached with Dadaji and he left his claim on Rukhmabai for payment of two thousand rupees
 tad rukhmabai england main adhyayan karne ke liye ravaanaa ho gai
 This case greatly influenced the reformers like Behramji Malabari who wrote extensively on the subject
 yah britain main bhi bahut ruchi ke saath liya ja rahaa tha jisamen mahila patrikaon main vyapak nariwadi charchaaen thim
 The promotion of the case helped in the passage of the Age Consent Act 1891, which made child marriage illegal in the British Empire

 sakriy nirdeshika ruparekha jisamen object hote hai, unhen kai staron main dekha ja saktaa he
 There is forest at the top of the structure
 van prayek object, iske atribyooton or sakriy nirdeshika ke niyamon kaa ek sangrah he
 Forests, trees, and domains are logical parts of an Active Directory network
 sakriy nirdeshika van main ek yaa ek se adhik sankramak, nyaas se jude vriksh hote hai
 a tree is a collection of one or more domains and domain trees that are again joined by an infectious trust hierarchy
 domenon ko unke dnes naam sanrachana, nemaspes se pahachaanaa jaataa he
 Objects established under a domain can be classified into containers or containers called organizational units)
 oyuas, ek domen ko ek padanukram pradaan karte hai, iske kriyanvayan ko aasaan bana dete hai or sanghathanaatmak yaa bhugolic drushti se sanghathan kii sanrachana kii ek saadrishyata pradaan kar sakate hai
 ouss can contain ouss - in fact, in this sense domains, are containers - and can hold multiple multiple grouped ous
 microsoft, nitiyon or kriyanvayan kii sanrachana kaa nirmaan karne or unke karyanvayan main sudhaar laane ke liye sakriy nirdeshika main jitna sambhav ho utane hi kuch domen or oyuas par ek nirbharta kii salaah dete hai
 The OU is the common level at which group policies are applied that are themselves Active Directory objects called Group Policy Objects), although policies can also be applied to domains and sites
 The OU is the level at which administrative powers are typically assigned but at the same time small dedications can be performed on individual objects or attributes
 haalanki, sanghathanaatmak ikaiyaan vyavasthaapak yaa prashaasak ke liye sirf ek pruthakkaran hai or sateek container ke rup main kaam nahin karte hai; isliye anternihit domen is tarah se sanchaalan karata he maano sabhi objecton ko kisi oyu ke bina hi ek saral flat-file sanrachana main nirmit kiya gaya tha
 As an example, it is not possible to create two user accounts of a user with the same identity such as "fred
staff-ou
domain" and "fred
student-ou
domain" in two different ous
 iske vipareet, ldpi or novel i-diarectory sateek padanukramit nirdeshikaayen hai jo alag-alag oyuas main object ke naam kii aavriti karne kii anumati pradaan karti hai
 Each user logs in by specifying their reference: "fred
staff-ou" or "fred
student-ou"
 jo apane khate ke sandarbh ko yaad nahin rakh sakate hai, aise prayoktaaon ke liye novel graahak log-in kaaryakshmata pradaan karata he jise sandarbh-rahit log-in ke rup main janaa jaataa he jo prayoktaaon ko sabhi sambhav milan yaa ek-samaan prayokta-naamon ko nirdeshika sanrachana main dhundne kii anumati pradaan karata he
 The concept of user context is not applicable in Active Directory because the username-frequency within the domain cannot be in the first place
 chunki ek sakriy nirdeshika domen ke alag-alag oyuas ke bheetar nakli prayokta-naam upasthit nahin rah sakate hai, isliye adwitiya khaataa naam kii utpatti hazaron-lakhon prayoktaaon vaale sanghathanon ke liye ek mahatvapurn chunauti khadi kar detii he jinhen alag-alag domenon main saraltapurvak up-vargeekrut nahin kiya ja saktaa he, jaise - ek public skool system yaa vishvavidhyalay ke chaatr, jinhen puure jila bhawanon yaa parisar network main kisi bhi computer main log-in karne main sakasham hona chahie
 When the number of users in a domain increases, methods for creating simple usernames such as "first initial, middle initial, last name" will become useless because they contain too many similar names, such as Smith or Johnson in the mass of which As a result, instances or duplicate names occur, such as two J
 a
 Smith for which one has to add a number at the end to separate the identity of one of these two people
 bad rahe kai prayoktaaon or naam kii aavritiyon ke kisi vidhi par, network iti karmchaaree nijee taur par smaranyogy prayokta-naamon ko banane kaa prayaas band kar sakate hai or prayokta-naam saraltapurvak 5 se 10 ank lambi ek anukramik sankhya ban jaataa he jo ek hi domen ke bheetar paryaapt namakaran vishistataa pradaan karata he
 Active Directory also supports the creation of sites, which instead of being logical, are physical groups defined by one or more IP sub-nets
 site, nimna-gati, vipien ) or ucch-gati ) conekshnon se jude sthanon ke madhya antar sthapit karte hai
 The site, domain, and OU differ in structure and are the same throughout the forest
 citon ko pratikruti dwaara utpann network yatayaat ko niyantrit karne ke liye or nikatatam domen niyantrakon ke graahakon ko sanderbhit karne ke liye bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Exchange 2007 also uses site topology for mail routing
 nitiyon ko bhi site ke str par lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 An important decision is the actual division of an organization's information infrastructure into one or more domains and a hierarchy of top-level ouss
 saamaanya model vyavsaayik ikai dwaara, bhugolic sthaan dwaara, IT seva dwaara, yaa object prakaar dwaara hote hai
 These models are also often used in combination
 oyuas ko pehle kriyanvanik samarpan ko suvidhajanak banane ke liye or uske baad samooh niti ke anuprayog ko suvidhajanak banane ke liye sanrachit kiya janaa chahie
 yadhyapi oyuas ek kriyanvanik seemaa kaa nirmaan karata he, lekin ekmaatr sateek suraksha seemaa swayan van he or van main kisi bhi domen ke ek vyavasthaapak ko van main sampoorn sabhi domenon main nyaas kiya janaa chahie
 Physically, Active Directory information is located on one or more similar peer domain controllers) replacing the NT PDC / BDC model

 Microsoft often refers to these partitions as "naming references"
 'skima' vibhaajanon main van ke bheetar ke object virgon or atribyooton kii paribhaasha hoti he
 The 'configuration' partition contains information about the physical structure and configuration of the forest
 The 'domain' partition contains all objects created in that domain

 Site-by-site replication can be configured to be installed between a bridgehead server in each site, which then frequencies changes to other dcss within the site
 bahu-domen van main sakriy nirdeshika databes vibhajit ho jaati he
 That is, each domain only maintains a list of objects that belong to that domain
 Therefore, as an example, a user created in Domain a will be listed only in Domain A's domain controllers
 Global list) is used to provide servers a global list of all objects in a forest
 vaishvik suchi, vaishvik suchi sarvaron ke rup main vinyast domen niyantrakon main sthapit hote hai
 Global list servers replicate all objects of all domains themselves and thus provide a global list of objects in the forest

 Being in the form of verses, they are easily remembered
 prachinkaal main gyaan ko lipibaddh karke rakhane kii pratha na hone ke kaaran hi is prakaar kaa praavdhaan kiya gaya tha
 Although the Vedas reflect the codes of the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda, the Hindus consider the Brahmin texts, the Aranyakas and Upanishads to be Vedas in addition to these codes
 inamen rik aadi samhitayen stuti pradhan hai; brahman granth yajna karm pradhan hai or aaranyak tathaa upanishad gyaan charchaa pradhan hai
 The texts of this category are considered parts of the Vedas

 is file kaa upyog ham digital processing, digital publicing, photo ko dekhne athwa uskaa print out nikaalane ke liye kar sakate hai
 Prior to the invention of this type of technology, we used a light sensitive paper to make a photograph on which an object was first exposed to light by using a lens and then washing the paper with liquid chemical solution Were made
 Digital photographs are made entirely using computer-based photoelectric and mechanical technology and have no place for wet chemical processing
 digital photography vastav me digital imaging kaa ek prakaar he
 iske alaava non-photographic upkaran jaise ki computer tomography, scanners or radio telescops ke madhyam se bhi digital tasviren banaai ja sakati he

 The first digital camera for general consumer use in the world became available in the market in the year 1990 
 Professional photography people soon became attracted to it because through digital files they could provide better results to their clients and employers more quickly than traditional photography
 Smartphones were also introduced in smartphones from 2007 onwards and in the coming years, digital camera smartphones were widely spread due to easy use of pictures in social media, e-mail and website
 Digital point-and-shoot and DSLR format cameras have also been competing with mirrorless digital cameras since 2010

 Functionalist theory has a special place in American sociology
 samajashaastra main pratyakshvaad ke saath hi saath prakaarywaadee soch kaa ek vishesh sthaan rahaa he
 The proponents of functionalist theory believe that the activities of society run in a systematic way and hence they see society as a system

 Herbert Spencer has emphasized that pediatric psychology should be compulsory in the education of every citizen
 baalamanovigyaan ke gyaan ke bina safal grihasth jivan vyateet nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Earlier in the 18th century Rousseau also stated the need of child psychology for the education of the child and some wrote in his book "emile", regarding the psychosis of the child based on his personal experience, but the views of scholars like Rousseau scientist
 Were not based on experiments
 baalkon ke shaareerik or maansik vikaas kaa vaigyanik dhang se adhyayan pichley 80 varshon se hi ho rahaa he
 Early studies of pediatrics took place in France

 Extensive work on child psychology has been done by the efforts of scholars from USA
 jo kaam simit rup se duusare dashon main kiya gaya, vah susangathit or vistrut dhang se america main hua he
 Even today, hundreds of scholars in America are studying different conditions of child development in many scientific laboratories
 dow stenle haal ne kishor baalkon kaa jaisaa adhyayan kiya he, vaisaa sansar main duusari jagah nahin hua
 His book titled "adolescence" is of importance to pedophilia
 aaj macorthon, gudenf, aadi vidvan bacchon ke kriyakalapon par anek pakaar ke adhyayan kar rahe hai
 The methods of pedophilia are usually those which are of general psychology
 baalamanovigyaan main vahya nirikshan ko adhik mahatv diya jaataa he
 Children's behavior is monitored spontaneously and another according to special rules
 baalamanovigyaan ke aankadon ko praapt karne ke liye jin upayon ko kaam main laayaa jaataa he unamem pramukh hai : suvyavasthit vaigyanik nirikshan, prayog, jivaniyon kaa adhyayan, diary lekhan, prashnawali, antardarshan or manovishleshan
 Talk about the behavior of children comes from many places - parents and teachers observe the behavior of children every day, so a lot can be known about their development from them
 yadi unhen balavyavahaar ke nirikshan kii training de di jaae, to unka kathan bahut upyogi ho jaataa he
 Specialists in pedophilia have been writing routines of their children's behaviors since childhood
 inaki ye diariyaan badi upyogi siddh hui hai
 Some great men have written their childhood experiences in their biographies and some have written childhood stories by their friends, or those who revere or love them
 in jivaniyon se bhi acchhee saamagree ikatthi ho jaati hai
 Some psychologists have obtained useful information from parents and teachers by making questionnaires
 bahut si baaten baalkon se prashn poochkar bhi gyaat kii jaati he
 Additionally Dutt of importance is gathered by special psychological experiments
 manovaigyanik prayogon ke liye vishesh prakaar kii shiksha kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In the present time, many important experiments are being conducted on the learning process of children, their memory and development of intelligence
 balavyavahaar or balvikas sambandhi anek upyogi baaten bacchon ke doctoron se tathaa bal sudhaar grihon se bhi milti hai
 Talk about the physical development of children, especially from doctors
 yah spasht he ki baalamanovigyaan ke nirmaan main shikshakon, doctoron, samajashastriyon dwaara, sabhi kii sahaayta kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Psychologists have created special tests to ascertain the qualifications, interests, values of life and sociality of children
 baalkon ke kriyakalapon kaa vishesh nirikshan karne ke liye ek aise kamare kaa bhi upyog kiya jaataa he jisamen paardarshakta keval ek ore hoti he
 This allows the psychologist to watch the child's actions without the child's knowledge
 is prakaar kaa dekhnaa balak ke swaabhaavik vyavhaar ke adhyayan ke liye aavashyak hota he
 Movies and tape records are also used to study child behavior and its language development
 inase manovaigyanik balak kii ek baar kii hui kriyaaon kaa, athwa ek samay kii baatcheet kaa, apni fursat main adhyayan kar letaa he
 Due to these applications, there are no common mistakes of memory
 baalamanovigyaan main baalkon kaa adhyayan do prakaar se hota he
 One is by observing individual children at different times from infancy to adolescence and the other at different times in the same situation
 pehle prakaar kaa adhyayan akshansh adhyayan kaha jaataa he or doosraa dashansh
 The data collected from the first type of study are more reliable, but it is very difficult to get personal information about the developmental life of many children
 jin baalkon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he, unka sthanparivartan praaia: ho jaataa he, atev is prakaar dutt ikaitha karnaa kathin hota hai
 Therefore, special progress of psychology has been made by studying in another way
 anek prakaar ke prayog kai baalkon ko ek hi jagah par lekar kiye jate hai
 Scientific data are collected by inspecting and experimenting with children in various stages
 is prakaar sampurna balvikas kaa chitra hamaare saamne aata he
 Some incomplete things are fulfilled by imagination
 vikasaatmak manovigyaan ke antargat maanav vikaas kii aarambhik prakriya kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he

 Kumbh festival is an important festival of Hinduism, in which crores of devotees take bath in Kumbh festival at Haridwar, Prayag, Ujjain and Nashik
 inamen se prayek sthaan par prati barahawein varsh or prayag main do kumbh parvon ke bich chah varsh ke antaraal main ardhakumbh bhi hota he
 The 2013 Kumbh took place in Prayag
 2019 main prayag main ardhakumbh meley kaa aayojan hoga
 According to astronomical calculations, this fair starts on the day of Makar Sankranti, when the Sun and Moon enter Scorpio, and Jupiter, Aries
 makar sankranti ke hone vaale is yoga ko "kumbh snaan-yoga" kehete hai or is din ko vishesh mangalik mana jaataa he, kyonki aisa mana jaataa he ki is din prithvi se ucch lokon ke dwaar is din khulte hai or is prakaar is din snaan karne se aatma ko ucch lokon kii prapti sahajata se ho jaati he
 Bathing here is considered to be a heavenly vision
 ‘ardh’ shabd kaa arth hota he aadha or isi kaaran baarah varshon ke antaraal main yojit hone vaale purna kumbh ke bich arthath purna kumbh ke chha: varsh baad ardh kumbh yojit hota he
 The last Kumbh in Haridwar took place in 1998
 haridwar main 26 janvari se 14 may 2004 tak chalaa tha ardh kumbh mela, uttaranchal rajya ke gathan ke pashchaat aisa pratham avasar tha
 During this, 14 April 2004 was considered the most auspicious day for the holy bath
 puranic vishwaas jo kuch bhi ho, jyotishiyon ke anusaar kumbh kaa asaadhaaran mahatv brihaspati ke kumbh raashi main pravesh tathaa surya ke mesh raashi main pravesh ke saath judaa he
 The position of the planets medicates the Ganges water at Har ki Pauri place on the banks of the Ganges flowing from Haridwar and it becomes nectaric in those days
 yahi kaaran he ki apni antaratma kii shuddhi hetu pavitra snaan karne lakhon shraddhalu yahan aate hai
 From the spiritual point of view, the position of planets during the period of Ardh Kumbh is excellent for concentration and meditation
 haalaanki sabhi hindu tyohaar samaan shraddha or bhakthi ke saath manaae jate he, par yahan ardh kumbh tathaa kumbh meley ke liye aane vaale paryatakon kii sankhya sabase adhik hoti he
 There are two or three mythological stories about the celebration of Kumbh festival, the most popular of which is the fall of nectar drops from Kumbh, the nectar received from the sea churning by the gods and goddesses
 is katha ke anusaar maharishi durvasa ke shaap ke kaaran jab indra or anya devtaa kamjor ho gaye to daityon ne devataaon par akraman kar unhen parrast kar diya
 Then all the gods together went to Lord Vishnu and told him all the accounts
 tab bhagwaan vishnu ne unhe daityon ke saath milakar kshirsagar kaa manthan karke amrit nikaalane kii salaah di
 At the behest of Lord Vishnu, the entire deity tried to make a treaty with the demons to extract the nectar
 amrit kumbh ke nikalate hi devataaon ke ishaare se indraputra 'jayant' amrit-kalash ko lekar akaash main ud gaya
 The demons then pursued Jayant to take back the nectar as per the order of Shyagacharya and after intense exertion, they caught Jayant in the middle
 tatpashchaat amrit kalash par adhikaar jamaane ke liye dev-daanvon main baarah din tak aviraam yuddh hota rahaa
 During this interconnection, nectar drops fell from the urn at four places of the earth
 us samay chandramaa ne ghat se prasravan hone se, surya ne ghat footne se, guru ne daityon ke apharan se evam shani ne devendra ke bhay se ghat kii raksha kii
 To calm discord, God took the form of a siren and gave it amrit to everyone and gave them drink
 is prakaar dev-daanav yuddh kaa ant kiya gaya
 For the attainment of nectar, there was a continuous war between the dev-danavs for twelve days
 devataaon ke baarah din manushyon ke baarah varsh ke tulya hote hai
 Hence, Aquarius is also twelve
 unamem se chaar kumbh prithvi par hote hai or shesh aath kumbh devloak main hote hai, jinhen devgan hi praapt kar sakate hai, manushyon kii vahaan pahunch nahin he
 When the lunar-sunic planets guarding the current zodiacs are protected at the time when the Chandradikas protect the Kalash, then the sum of Aquarius is there, ie the year in which the Sun, Moon and Jupiter coincide
 That is, in the same year, in the sum of the same zodiac sign, Kumbh festival takes place wherever the nectar drops fell

 This temple is included in 51 Shakti Peethas
 jwalamukhi mandir ko jota vaali kaa mandir or nagarkot bhi kaha jaataa he
 The credit for finding the Jwalamukhi temple goes to the Pandavas
 unheen ke dwaara is pavitra dharmik sthal kii khoj hui thi
 Mother Sati's tongue fell on this site
 is mandir main mata ke darshan jyoti rup main hote he
 Near the Jwalamukhi temple is the temple of Baba Gora Nath
 jise gorakh dibbi ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The primary construction of this temple was done by King Bhumi Chand
 baad main maharaja ranjit singh or raja sansarchand ne 1835 main is mandir kaa purna nimarn karaayaa
 There are nine Jyothi Jyotis of Mata inside the temple, known as Mahakali, Annapurna, Chandi, Hinglaj, Vindhyavasani, Mahalakshmi, Saraswati, Ambika, Anjadevi
 durga saptshati or devi mahatyamay ke anusaar devataaon or asuron ke bich main sau varshon tak yuddh chalaa tha
 The army of Asuras won this battle
 asuro kaa raja mahisasur swarg kaa raja ban gaya or devtaa saamaanya manushyon ki bhaanti dharti par vichalan karne lage
 Then the defeated deity proceeded to Brahma ji and went to the place where Shiva went to Lord Vishnu
 sari katha kah sunai
 Hearing this, Lord Vishnu and Shivji were very angry, because of that anger Vishnu, a sharp one was generated from Shivji's body
 bhagwaan shankar ke tej se us devi kaa mukh, vishnu ke tej se us devi kii vaayen, brahama ke tej se charan tathaa yamraj ke tej se bal, indra ke tej se kati pradesh tathaa anya devtaa ke tej se us devi kaa sharir bana
 Then Himalayas provided lions, Lord Vishnu, Kamal, Indra, Ghanta and Samudra provided the never-ending garland
 tabhi sabhi devataaon ne devi kii aradhana kii taaki devi prasann ho or unke kashto kaa nivaaran ho sake
 And the same thing happened
 devi ne prasann hokar devataaon ko vardaan de diya or kaha main tumhaari raksha avashya karuungi
 As a result, the goddess started a war with Mahishasura
 jisamen devi ki vijay hui or tabhi se devi kaa naam mahisasur mardani pad gaya
 The Jwalamukhi temple is one of the Shakti Peetha temples
 puure bharatvarsh main kul 51 shaktipeeth he
 All of which have the same story of origin
 yah sabhi mandir shiv or shakti se jude huai he
 According to religious texts, parts of the goddess fell on all these places
 shiv ke sasur raja daksh ne yajna kaa aayojan kiya jisame unhone shiv or sati ko aamantrit nahin kiya kyonki vah shiv ko apane baraabar kaa nahin samajhate the
 Sati felt very bad about this and reached the yagna without calling
 yajna sthal par shiv kaa kaaphi apmaan kiya gaya jise sati sahan na kar saki or vah havan kund main kud gayin
 When Lord Shankar came to know about this, he came and removed Sati's body from Havan Kund and started doing Tandava
 jis kaaran saare brahmand main haahaakaar much gaya
 To save the entire universe from this crisis, Lord Vishnu divided the body of Sati from his Sudarshan Chakra into 51 parts which became the Shakti Peetha where he fell
 manyata he ki jwalaji main mata sati kii jeebh giri thi
 Jwalamukhi Temple is also known as Jota Wali Temple and Nagarkot

 He reached this place chasing his cow
 iske peeche kaaran yah tha ki uski gaay doodh nahin de rahi thi vah apana sara doodh pavitra jwalamukhi main ek divya kanya ko pilaa aati thi
 He saw this scene with his own eyes and told the king there
 raja dwaara satya kii jaanch ke liye apane sipaahiyon ko bheja gaya
 The soldiers also saw this view
 unhone sari baat raja ko bataai or satya kii jaanch ke pashchaat raja dwaara is sthaan par mandir kaa nirmaan karaayaa gaya
 There is a legend about the Jwalamukhi temple
 yah 1542 se 1605 ke madhya kaa hi hoga tabhi akbar dilli kaa raja tha
 The meditated mother was the ultimate devotee of Jotawali
 ek baar devi ke darshan ke liye vah apane gaanvvaasiyo ke saath jwalaji ke liye niklaa
 When his convoy passed through Delhi, the Mughal Emperor Akbar's soldiers stopped him and presented him in the court of King Akbar
 akbar ne jab dhyanu se poocha ki vah apane gaanvvaasiyon ke saath kahaan ja rahaa he to uttar main dhyanu ne kaha vah jotavaali ke darshano ke liye ja rahe hai
 Akbar said what strength does your mother have? And what can she do? Then Dhyanu said that she is going to protect the whole world
 aisa koi bhi kaary nahin he jo vah nahin kar sakati he
 Akbar cut the head of the horse of Dhyanu and said that if your mother has power, then add the head of the horse and make it alive
 yah vachan sunakar dhyanu devi kii stuti karne laga or apana sir kaat kar mata ko bhet ke rup main pradaan kiya
 The head of the horse was joined by the power of mother
 is prakaar akbar ko devi kii shakti kaa ehsaas hua
