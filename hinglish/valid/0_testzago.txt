 The Sinhala language, which is similar to more than one language of North India, has developed from the language of those inscriptions which BC
 Available continuously since the second-third century
 bhagwaan buddha ke parinirvana ke do sau varsh baad ashokaputra mahendra sinhal dweep pahunche, to "mahavansh" ke anusaar unhone sinhal dweep ke logon ko dweep bhashaa main hi upadesh diya tha
 The tradition that Mahamati Mahendra brought with him was "oral"
 vah parampara yaa to buddha ke samay kii "magadhi" rahi hogi, yaa unke do sau varsh baad kii koi aisi "praakrit" jise mahendra sthavir swayan bolte rahe honge
 Sinhala history holds that Mahendra Sthavir brought with him not only the tradition of Tripitaka, but also the traditions of his languages or his stories

 The current Pali stories are re-translations of Sinhala translations of the original Pali books

 If any other literature after Sinhala inscriptions can be considered the oldest literature of Sinhala

 The specific situation of Sinhala poetry today is the result of many developments in "kotte Kalaya"

 The modern Gujarat state is named after the Gurjar caste
 The word Gujarat originates from the word Gurjatra which means - those which are under the control of Gurjars
 Before Gujarat, this region was known as Lat, Saurashtra and kathiawad
the Gurjar caste gave their names to many places

 Regarding the country of Gurjars, he has written that 'gurjars reach the state when they go north around 1800 li from Vallabhi's country
 This country is in the vicinity of 5000 li

 The term "IQ" derives from the German word intelligenz-quotient, first used by German psychologist William Stern in 1912 for the methodologies proposed by Alfred Bynette and Theodore Simone in the early 20th century for the intellectual testing of modern children Was adopted haalanki "IQ" shabd kaa upyog aamtaur par ab bhi hota he kintu, ab vechsler edlt intelligence scale jaisi paddatiyon kaa upyog aadhunik bauddhik str pareekshan main kiya jaataa he jo gaussian bel karv kisi vishay ke prati jhukaav par naape gayi rank ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he, jisamen kendriya maan 100 hota he or maanak vichlan 15 hota he

 " On the other hand, a 2003 study by Eric Turkheimer, Andréna Hale, Marie Waldron, Brian De Onofrio, Irving I
 Gottesman noted that differences in the ratio of IQ cause differences in genes and environmental socioeconomic conditions
 unhone paaya ki garib pariwaron main IQ ke maamle main 60% kaa antar he
 The study was conducted on 7-year-old twins who were housed in a shared environment and their gene contribution was close to zero
 yah apeksha uchit hogi ki anuvaanshik prabhaavon kaa IQ jaisi vishistataa par tab prabhaav kam mahatvapurn ho jaataa he jab umr ke saath-saath koi anubhav arjeet karata he
 Surprisingly, the opposite is true
 The effect of heredity in infancy is as low as 20%, around 40% in the middle of childhood and 80% in adulthood
 american psychological association kii 1995 main "intelligence: nons and ananons" ke liye gathit task force is nattejey par pahunchi ki shwet jansankhya kaa anuvaanshik IQ "75 ke aasapaas" he
 In addition to a study of the upbringing of Minnesota twins for several years, a 1979 study of 100 years of separate parenting of twins concluded that heredity is associated with the allocation of IQ

 There are several other points to be noted while interpreting heredity: anuvaanshikta kii bhinnataaon main antar viksit or vikasshil deshon ke bich paae jate hai
 This affects heredity estimates

 a recent study found that the FADS2 gene combines about seven IQ points with breastfeeding in those with the "C" variant of the gene
 FADS2 jin ke "ji" sanskaran waalon main iskaa koi phayda nahin dikhataa
 Music training in childhood is also helpful in increasing IQ
 haal ke adhyayan se yah pataa chalaa he ki kisi vyakti kii kaaryakari smriti kaa upyog karne ke prashikshan se bhi uske IQ main vruddhi ho sakati he
 In some studies in the developed world, personality traits suggest that contrary environmental expectations actually affect those who, despite not belonging to that family, thrive in the same family, if they were in the other family, they would be like children in the other family
 Children have some family effects on IQ, for which a quarter of variation should be maintained, however, adults This correlation approaches in education becomes zero
 IQ se jude god lene se sambandhit adhyayan bataate hai ki kishoravastha ke baad god lene vaale bhai bahan kaa IQ ajanabi logon se nahin miltaa julata he, jabaki sabhi bhai bahan main IQ kaa parsparik sambandh 0
6 he
 Studies of twins have reinforced this pattern: identical identical twins were nurtured separately but had a similar IQ and were close to the IQ of identical-looking twins who were raised together It was much higher than the IQ of adopted children
 stulmiller ne paaya ki paariwarik vaataavaran main pratibandh kii jo seemaa hoti he vah god lene ke maamle main bhi vahi rahati he jo god lene vaale pariwaron main rahati he, udhaaharan ke liye tatkaaleen aam janasamudaay kii saamaajik-aarthik sthiti, jabaki pichley adhyayanon main saajha parivaar ke maahaul kii bhoomika ko bahut badhachadha kar pesh kiya gaya tha
 Improvements in the study of the extent of improvement in adoption are indicated as socio-economic status is responsible for up to 50% of the change in IQ
 haalanki, god lene ke maamle main IQ kii seemaa par pratibandh ke prabhaav kaa adhyayan mat macgue or unke sahyogiyon ne kiya he, jinhone likhaa he ki "mata-pita kii rokatoke kii manogranthi or parivaar kii saamaajik-aarthik sthiti kii seemaa kaa god liye bachche ke ai kyuu ke parsparik sambandh par asar nahin daalate

 The effect of the shared maternal environment, often considered insignificant, accounts for 20% of the coexpression of twins and 5% among siblings, and the effects of genes are reduced to two magnitudes accordingly and that of heredity
 The effect is reduced by at least 50%

 ek to ve jinamein kisi bhashaa ke shabdon ke arth or vivechan usee bhashaa main hote he or duusare ve jinamein ek bhashaa ke shabdon ke arth duusari bhashaa yaa bhashaaon me die jate hai
 There can be many types of thesaurus with the idea of subject, such as Mathematics dictionary, Legal dictionary, Medical dictionary etc
 aise koshon kii ginati praaia: shabdaawaliyon main hoti he, jaise krishi shabdaawalee, darshanik shabdaawalee, bhugolic shabdaawalee aadi
 Apart from these, some specific poets, dialects etc
 also have different lexicons, such as Tulsi Kosh, Sur Kosh, Awadhi Kosh, Brajbhasha Kosh, etc
 kisi vishisht vishay ke mahatvapurn granth main aae hue mukhya pratikon, vishyon yaa shabdon ke jo kosh yaa talikaay hoti he, unhen kramaat pratikanukramanika, vishayanukramanika yaa shabdanukramanika kehete hai
 Lexicography is an art
 is kala kaa gyaan vartmaan yug kii param unnat bhashaaon ke shabdkoshon kaa sookshm drushti se adhyayan karne par praapt ho saktaa he
 Editing of good and authentic thesaurus cannot be done only on the strength of scholarship, as long as the art of lexicography is also fully understood and the knowledge of this art can only come from the lifelong study of the lexicon
 sabhi prakaar ke kosh kisi vishesh uddeshy tathaa kisi vishesh kshetra kii aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye hi banaae jate hai
 Therefore, this purpose or need is mainly taken care of in the lexicon
 duusare, is baat kaa bhi baraabar dhyaan rakhana padataa he ki uskaa sara kalevar sabhi drushtiyon se santulit rahe; aisa na ho ki koi ang to aavashyaktaa yaa auchity se adhik bad jaae or koi uski tulana main kshinkaay yaa hin jaan pade
 The words should also be discussed and the order of the organs of that thought should always remain the same
 shabdon kii bhi jatiyaan yaa varg hote hai, at: ek jati yaa varg ke sab shabdon kaa sara vivechan ek sa hona chahie
 If examples of authentic texts or writers are taken, then they should be taken as much fraction as possible to clarify the intention and resolve the curious
 achche koshon main sabhi prakaar ke kshetron or vishyon ke paribhaashik shabd bhi rahete hai
 Therefore, the editor should have general knowledge or understanding of more and more subjects
 aavashyaktaa hone par kisi anjaane yaa nae vishay ke achche or pramanik granth se yaa uske achche gyaata se bhi sahaayta lenaa aavyashk hota he
 In the task of lexicography, the vision should be very wide and the instinct should be honeycomb
 drushti itani paini or sookshm honi chahie jo sahaj main nir ksheer kaa vivek kar saken or puraani trutiyon, dosha, bhuulon aadi ko dhundkar sahaj main unka sanshodhan tathaa sudhaar kar sake
 In the lexicon, there should also be no partiality or malicious name
 uskaa ekmaatr uddeshy hona chahie bhashaa tathaa sahitya kii seva
 In the lexicon, the primacy is only of meanings and thoughts, so there should not be any spread or overlap in them
 sabhi baaten nappi tuli, maryaadit or yathasadhay sankshipt honi chahie
 The maximum and concrete information in the dictionary should be presented in minimum words
 phaltu yaa bharti kii baton ke liye kosh main sthaan nahin hota
 Some forms of words are normative and many forms are spatial or provincial
 jin sthanik yaa prantiy shabdon ke maanak rup praapt hon, unka sara vivechan unheen maanak shabdon ke antargat rahanaa chahie or unke sthanik yaa prantiy roopon ke aage unke maanak roopon kaa abhidesh maatr hona chahie
 This has the great advantage that other linguists readily learn the standard form of the words and help the standard form of the language to be constant — that the form of the language is not deteriorated by the unfamiliar
 yahi baat aise sanskrit shabdon ke sambandh main bhi honi chahie jiske bahut se paryaay hon
 Like lotus, river, mountain, sea etc
 shabdon ke aage unke paryaay dete samay bhi is baat kaa dhyaan rahanaa chahie ki paryaay vahi die jaae jo mul shabd kaa thik aashay yaa maap bataanevaale hon
 It is advisable to abandon those environments in such contexts, due to which confusion may arise
 koshkaron ke saamne idhar haal main webster kii new world dictionari ne ek nayaa adarsh rakhaa he jo bahut hi upyogi tathaa upadey hone ke kaaran shabdkoshon ke liye vishesh anukaraniya he
 It also shows the subtle differences of similar resemblances to them under several words, such as - subtle differences of dread, frit, alarms, disme, terrer and panic are also mentioned under the fear
 aisa yah soch kaa kiya gaya he ki koshkar kaa kaam shabdon ke arth batala dene se hi samaapt nahin ho jaataa, varan isse bhi aage badhkar uskaa kaam logon ko shabdon ke thik prayog batalaana hota he
 We will find hundreds of thousands of such words, whose subtle differences can be revealed, and thus the curious can be made to think about the words in a new way
 haal ke achche or bade angareji koshon main ek or nai tathaa upyogi paripati chali he jo bhartiya bhashaaon ke koshon ke liye vishesh rup se upyogi ho sakati he
 In all languages, there are many compound words which are formed by prefixing
 kanishtha se akanishtha, karaniya se akaraniya, apekshit se anpekshit, aavashyak se anaavashyak, mantri se upamantri, samiti se upasmiti, paalan se paripaalan, bhraman se paribhraman, karm se pratikarm, vidhaan se pratividhan aadi
 The number of such words formed by the sum of prefixes is very large
 aise shabdon do virgon main bante hote hai athwa baante ja sakate hai
 For one, the words whose words are not combined with any new or specific meaning in the former verse and the answer word, which is why they live under ordinary words
 aise shabdon or unke arthon se kosh kaa kalevar bahut bad jaataa he
 To avoid this kind of meaningless expansion, this new method has been adopted in the new dictionaries of Webster that they are not considered as independent words and hence their meanings have not been taken
 prishth ke ant main ek rekha ke neeche aise shabdon kii suchi maatr de di gai he, yatha-an-dizyrd, an-disterbd, an-free, an-hart, an-invited aadi
 Yes, unlike these, there are certain words of other class in which some new meanings are derived from the addition of prefixes
 jaise visheshan rup main akach kaa rup bina balonvala to he hi, par sangya rup main vah ketu grah kaa bhi ek naam he
 Anagar means not only a householder, but in noun form he is also a signifier of a monk
 isaliye aise shabd lenaa aavashyak hota he
 The words whose meanings are automatically destroyed by the sum of predecessor and post-apocalyptic, it is considered futile to take meaning in the dictionary
 at: prishthant main aise shabdon kii suchi maatr de dena yathesht hoga
 Yes, the compound words in which a new and special meaning is derived from the sum of the two terms, it is necessary to take them in the same place as the meaning
 hamaare yahan ke puraane sanskrit koshon kii paddati yah rahi he ki ati, prati sah aadi ke yoga se bananevaale shabd apane purv padwale shabd ke antargat ek hi sheershak main ek saath de die jate he
 Some dictionaries of Hindi have also followed this practice
 yadhyapi sanskrit vyakaran kii drushti se yah paddati yuktisangat hoti he, phir bhi sanskrit koshon tak main inkaa puraa puraa paalan hota hua nahin dikhaai detaa
 There is some saving of space in this, but it becomes very difficult for exceptional readers to find the words
 kabhi kabhi to aise logon ke liye bhi is paddati se shabd dhoondhna kathin hota he jo iske niyamon or siddhanton se bahut kuch parichit hote hai
 In every language, there are some words which are also invariant, adverbs, adjectives, suffix nouns etc
 with the idea of different meanings and are also derived from different roots, ie Hindi is also a noun, adjective and suffix
 Too
 apane sangya rup main bhi vah apane kai arthon main kuch alag alag mulon se vyutpann he
 Such words are considered to be separate and independent words in modern and superior English lexicons and are treated with different titles, viz
 English also has a vise adjective, noun and suffix also and in three forms its titles are kept separately
