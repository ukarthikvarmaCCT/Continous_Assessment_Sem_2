 paropkaarita ko samajhane ke liye aadhaar ke rup main ve samooh chayan ke vyaavhaarik sambhaavna yaa mahatv ke bare main vishesh rup se andeh rakhte hai
 This behavior first appears as an evolutionary paradox, because helping others gives them precious resources and reduces their fitness
 Earlier, many people interpreted as one aspect of group selection: the individual Doing what is best for the survival of the population or species as a whole
 british vikasvaadi jeevigyaani dabludi hamiltan ne apane samanvit fitness siddhant main jin-frequency vishleshan kaa upyog karne ke liye yah dikhaaya ki kaise vanshanugat paropkaaree gun viksit ho sakate hai yadi aisi paropkaarita ke kalakaaron or praptakartaaon ke bich paryaapt anuvaanshik samanta he

 Dakin's mem refers to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replication of a specific idea or set of ideas

 Because memes are not always fully copied, they may be refined, combined, or otherwise modified by other ideas; This results in new memes, which may prove themselves to be more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus, providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural development based on memes, which is the basis of genes But is similar to the theory of biological evolution

 He said that his understanding of science and developmental processes led him to question how adults in leadership positions in a civilized world could still be illiterate in biology, and were surprised that God i believe in how many people have refined science
 dokin kehete hai ki kuch bhautikavidon ne 'ishwar' ko brahmad ke saamaanya bhay-preranadayak rahasyon ke liye roopak ke rup main upyog kiya he, jo logon ke bich bhram or galatfahami kaa kaaran banataa he, jo galat tareeke se sochate hai ki ve ek rahasyamay astitv ke bare main baat kar rahe hai, jo paapon ko kshamaa karata he, sharaab ko transsbentiet karata he, yaa logon ko banaata he ve marane ke baad rahete hai

 In addition to beliefs in the gods, Dworkin has criticized other irrational religious beliefs such as Jesus releasing water into the wine, that a fetus begins as a blob, that magic underwear will protect you, that Jesus was resurrected , That semen comes from the spine, that Jesus walked on the water, that the sun sets in a swamp, that the Garden of Eden existed in Missouri, that Jesus' mother was a virgin Was, whereby Muhammad split the moon and Lazarus was raised from the dead

 Inspired by the consciousness-raising success of feminists in causing widespread embarrassment over the regular use of "she" instead of "she", Dawkins similarly suggests that phrases such as "catholic child" and "muslim child" are "marxist
" Children "should be considered socially absurd, as they believe that children are not classified based on the ideological or religious beliefs of their parents Should not

 ' Dawkins is a prominent critic of creationism, a religious belief that humanity, life, and the universe were created by a deity without evolution
 unhone yuva prithvi ke srujanaatmak drushtikon ko varnit kiya he ki prithvi keval kuch hajaar saal purana he, "ek asantoshjanak, man-sikudte jhooth"; or unki 1986 kii kitaab da blind wachmekar main tark se nirantar aalochana hoti he, ek mahatvapurn srujanavaadee tark kitaab main, dokin ne 18 veen sadi ke angreji dharmavigyaani wiliam paale dwaara apni pustak prakritik dharamshastra ke madhyam se prasiddh ghadeevaar paksh ke khilaaf bahes kii he, jisamen paley kaa tark he ki jaise hi ek ghadi bahut jatil or bahut hi kaaryaatmak he, keval durghatana ke kaaran astitv main he, isliye sabhi jivit chizon ko bhi - apane adhik se adhik jatilta ke saath-uddeshypurna tareeke se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie

 unki 1998 kitaab aveviving da renbo ne jon kets ke aarope ko maanate hue kaha ki indradhanush ko samajhakar, ijac newton ne apni sundarataa ko kam kiya he; daakins ke vipareet nishkarsh ke liye tark he unhone suzav diya ki gahari jagah, jivan ke vikaas ke arabon varsh, or jeev vigyaan or anuvanshikta ke sookshm kaaryon main "mithkon" or "chhadam vigyaan" kii tulana main adhik sundarataa or aashcharya hoti he
 a book dedicated to rejecting alternative medicine, Snake Oil, published posthumously by John Diamond, Dawkins wrote a prologue in which he claimed alternative medicine was harmful, if only because it would distract patients from more successful conventional treatments
 Is and gives false expectations to people
 dokin kehete hai ki "koi vaikalpik chikitsa nahin hoti he
 There is only medicine which works and which does not work

 In chemistry, subcomponent compounds are compounds in which an atom or ion is attached to an array of molecules or cations that surround it
 bahut se dhaatu-yukt yogic upasahsanyojak yogic hi hai
 a more comprehensive definition of 'subcomponent compound' is - anekon prakaar ke upasahsanyojak yogic maujuud hai jinamein jaleey vilyan main dhaatu se lekar vibhinn jaivaracinic prakriyaaon main bhaag lene vaale jatil dhatvik anzime aadi hai
 Subcomponent bond is formed when both electrons are given by the same element in a partnership
 jo tatv electron yugma detaa he vah daata he or doosraa vaala grahi he
 It is often represented by arrows
 hydrogen paraksaide, sulfur diaksaide, hydronium aayan, pherocynide aadi iske kuch udhaaharan hai
 Alfred Werner called the general fraternity of metals a 'primary' fraternity
 kuch dhaatuon main praathmik bandhuta ke atirikt ek or bandhuta hoti he, jise 'dwitiyak' bandhuta kehete hai
 This secondary fraternity itself was given the name of 'subcomponent' and 'subcomponent-compound' of such compounds
 aise yogicon ko verner ne ucch varg yogic kaha he
 Positive ions, especially when they are small and highly charged, attract electrons from the lateral negative ions or neutral molecules that have 'unsolvable' electrons
 yadi aakarshan adhik he, to dhatvik aayan or anya samoohon ke bich electron sajhi ho jaataa he
 The metallic ion is called 'receiver' and the other group as 'donor'
 jab platinic chloride ko ammonia ke saath upachaarit kiya jaataa he tab aisa hi yogic, hexaminic platinic hexachloride, banataa he
 The formation of chemical compounds is known by the variation in color, solubility and other properties of such compounds
 aise bane platinum ke yogic main na platinum ke or na chlorine ke hi pareekshak lakshan paae jate hai
 The groups in which the stranded electrons reside are ammonia, water, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, alkyl amine, dialkyl amine, trialkyl amine, alkyl sulfide, cyanide, thiocyanide, etc
 yogicon main do, yaa do se adhik, kism ke daata rah sakate hai
 The number of donor groups in centrally located metallic ions remains fixed for each metallic ion
 aisi sankhya ko upasahsanyojaktaa-sankhya kehete hai
 According to Sijvik this number depends on the atomic number of elements
 yah do se aath tak ho sakati he
 Hydrogen has a valency number of two and heavy metals eight
 yadi daata samooh yaa parmaanu main ek jode se adhik asajhi electron vidyaman hon, to aise samooh yaa parmaanu do dhatvik yanon se sanyukt ho sakate hai
 In this manner, binary complexes are formed
 aisa hi ek dwinabhik sanmishra dieol owatemin dicobaltic sulphate he: If the donor atoms are present in the same molecule but at least there is separation of them from each other atom, then this type of ring is called 'keylet ring'
 keeleti karan se yogicon kaa sthayitv bahut bad jaataa he
 The five-member keylet rings are the most permanent
 chaar yaa chha: sadsy vaale keelet valay bhi saralata se ban jate hai
 This effect is clearly seen in organic amino-compounds
 monomethil amin kadachit hi upasahsanyojak-yogic banataa he, par ethilin diomin badi saralata se upasahsanyojak-yogic banataa he, jo bahut sthaayee hota he
 The normal secondary amine is rarely a subcomponent-compound, but the diethylene triamine readily combines with both heavy nitrogen ions with both nitrogens, forming a very stable bicylate ring
 alpha-amina amla anek dhaatuon ke hydroxidon se adhik kriya kar bahut sthaayee yogic banaata he
 In this, both the acid and amino groups combine with the metal to form a chelate ring
 yadi upasahsanyojaktaa-sankhya bandhuta se duguni he, to aise yogic anyanit hote hai or inhen 'aantar lavan' kehete hai
 Such internal salts are also formed from some hydroxy acids and diketones
 aise yogic jal main aviley hone par, carbonic vilaayakon main viley hote hai
 They are also volatile in steam
 kachche chamade par chromium lavenon se charmshodhan main kuch aisi hi kriya chromium lavan or chamade ke polipeptidon ke bich hoti he
 Purification of skin is believed to be due to such internal salts

 The platinum ion has four valencies on one plane
 at: iske yogic platinum diamin dychloride do rup main, sis rup or trens rup main, praapt hue hai
 They differ in color, solubility and chemical behavior
 aisa keval platinum ke saath hi nahin hota, anya dhaatuon, jaise pelladium, nikal, cadmium, paarad aadi ke saath bhi aisa dekha jaataa he
 If there are six cohesive groups and two of them are different from the other four groups, they can also have two forms, sis and trance
 dychloro-tetramin cobaltic chloride do roopon main paaya gaya he
 One is purple in color and the other is green
 upasahsanyojak yogic praayah jatil aayan hote hai
 Most of these aqueous solutions are not ionized and therefore do not have electrolytes
 kintu iske vipareet, platinum ke nimnlikhit upasahsanyojak yogic jal main viyojit hokar jatil aayan utpann karte hai
 Cl4 → 4+ + 4 Cl– Cl3 → 3+ + 3 Cl– Cl2 → 2+ + 2 Cl– Cl → + + Cl– k → k + + - K2 → 2 K+ + 2– There are several types of subcomponent-compounds

 The term tuberculosis treatment is used for the therapeutic treatment of the infectious disease tuberculosis
 agar sakriy tapedic kaa upachaar na kiya jaye, har teen main se lagbhag do rogiyon kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Tuberculosis patients who are treated appropriately have a mortality rate of only 5 percent
 tibi ke liye maanak upachaar main isoniyazid, rifampicin, pairazinamide or athembutol kaa upyog do maheene ke liye kiya jaataa he, iske baad keval isoniyazid or rifampicin kaa upyog chaar maheene ke liye kiya jaataa he
 After six months it is believed that the patient's treatment is complete
 
 is sushupt tapedic ke liye chah se nau maheene tak keval isoniyazid se maanak upachaar kiya jaataa he
 If the organism is considered completely sensitive, it is first treated with isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for four months
 athembutol kaa upyog karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he
 The standard names for all first line drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis are three letters in English and are abbreviated to only one letter
 sanyukt rajya america main saamanytah aise naamon or sankshipt roopon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo antarrashtriya str par maanya nahin hai: rifampicin ko rifampin kaha jaataa he or iskaa sankshipt rup RIF he; streptomicine ko aamtaur par iske sankshipt rup SM se janaa jaataa he
 Similarly, drug names are also abbreviated in a standard way
 dawaaon kii suchi unke ek akshar vaale sankshipt rup kaa upyog karke banaayi jaati he iske aage ek sankhya upsarg lagaaya jaataa he, jo upachaar ke maheenon kii sankhya ko bataata he; ek sabscript aantrayik khuraaq ko bataata he or agar koi sabscript nahin lagaaya jaataa to iskaa arth he ki dawa kii khuraaq roj di jaaegi
 adhikansh upachaar prakriyaaon main shuruyaat main ucch tivrata kii pravastha hoti he, jiske baad ek nirantar pravastha hoti he : ucch tivrata kii pravastha pehle di jaati he, iske baad nirantar pravastha di jaati he, donon pravasthaaon ko ek slesh ke nishaan ke dwaara alag alag kar diya jaataa he
 So iskaa arth he isoniyazid, rifampicin, athembutol or pairazinamide roj do maheene ke liye iske baad isoniyazid or rifampicin ek saptaah main teen baar di jaati he
 These standard abbreviations are used in the remainder of this article
 duusari pankti ke dawaaon ke chah varg hai jinka upyog tibi ke upachaar main kiya jaataa he
 a drug is classified as a second line instead of a first line for three possible reasons: it may be less effective than a first line drug; Or, it may have toxic side effects; Or it may not be available in many developing countries
 anya dawaaen jo upyogi ho sakati hai, parantu WHO kii SLD kii suchi main nahin hai: These drugs are considered "third line drugs" and are listed here because they are either not very effective or because their effectiveness has not yet been proven
 Rifabutin is effective, but it has not been included in the World Health Organization list because it is non-practically expensive for most developing countries
 50 saalon se zyada samay se tapedic kaa upachaar sangyojan chikitsa ke dwaara kiya jaataa rahaa he
 No drug is used alone and the body develops rapid immunity to the drugs used alone and treatment is unsuccessful
 tibi ke upachaar ke liye kai dawaaon kaa ek saath istemaal sambhavyata par aadhaarit he
 The frequency of spontaneous mutations that result in resistance to a particular drug is: one in 107 for EMB, 1 in 108 for STM and INH, and 1 in 1010 for RMP
 jis rogi ko vyapak phuffusiya tibi hota he, uske sharir main lagbhag 1012 jeevanu hote hai or inamen sambhavatya 105 EMB pratirodhi jeevanu, 104 STM pratirodhi jeevanu, 104 INH pratirodhi jeevanu or 102 RMP pratirodhi jeevanu hote hai
 Resistance mutations occur spontaneously and independently, so there is a possibility of harboring a bacterium that is automatically resistant to both INH and RMP
 108 main 1 x 1010 main 1 = 1018 main 1 or uske ek aise jeevanu kii sharan main jane sambhaavna 1033 main 1 hoti he jo sabhi chaaron dawaaon ke liye anayas pratirodhi ho jaye
 yah nishchit rup se, ek sarleekaran he, parantu yahi sangyojan chikitsa ko spasht karne kaa ek sahi tarika bhi he
 There are many theoretical reasons that support combination therapy
 vibhinn dawaaon ke upyog se alag prakaar kii pratikriya hoti he
 INH is bactericidal against bacterial replication
 EMB kam khuraaq par jeevanurodhi he, parantu iskaa upyog tapedic upachaar main ucch, jeevanunashak khuraaq main kiya jaataa he
 RMP is bactericidal and has an infectious effect
 PZA keval kamjor jeevanunashak he, lekin macrophesso kii sthiti main yaa teevr sujan ke sthanon main, amleey vaataavaran main sthit jeevanuon ke liye bahut adhik prabhavi he, Before the introduction of rifampicin, all TB treatments were used for a period of 18 months or even longer
 1953 main, sanyukt raashtra kii maanak khuraaq 3SPH / 15PH yaa 3SPH / 15SH2 thi
 Between 1965 and 1970, EMP replaced PAS
 1968 main tibi ke upachaar ke liye RMP kaa upyog kiya jane laga or 1970 main BTS ke adhyayan se yah pataa chalaa ki 2HRE / 7HR prabhavotpadak tha
 In 1984, a BTS study showed that 2HRZ / 4HR was efficacious, with a rate of ineffectiveness found to be less than 3 percent after two years
 1995 main, jab yah pataa chalaa ki INH pratirodh bad rahaa he, BTS ke saath EMB yaa STM ko milaane kii salaah di gayi: 2HREZ / 4HR yaa 2SHRZ / 4HR, isi khuraaq kaa upyog vartmaan main kiya ja rahaa he
 The World Health Organization suggested that if the patient's culture is found positive even after 2 months of treatment, then a six-month continuation phase of HR should be used
 or un rogiyon main bhi iskaa upyog kiya janaa chahie jinamein upachaar kii shuruyaat main vyapak dwipaksheeya guhika kaa nirmaan ho gaya ho
 The term DOTS is used for "directly observed therapy, short-course" and is one of the main plans of the World Health Organization to prevent TB
 isamen tibi ke niyantran ke liye sarkaar kii vachanabaddhata, tibi ke sakriy lakshanon se yukt rogiyon main thook-smier microscopy pareekshan, pratyaksh prekshan chote-course chemotherapy upachaar, dawaaon kii ek nishchit aapurti, manakikrut reporting or maamalon or upachaar ke parinaamon kii recording shaamil he
 The WHO recommends that therapy for all TB patients should be observed for the first two months: this means that the independent observer observing the patient should have complete monitoring of their anti-tb treatment
 An independent observer is often not a health care worker, he may be a shopkeeper or an elder in society, or similarly a senior person
 dots kaa upyog aantrayik khuraaq ke saath kiya jaataa he
 Twice a week dose is also effective but not recommended by WHO, as there is no margin for error
 dots kaa thik prakaar se upyog karne se upachaar kii safalataa kii dar 95 pratishat se bhi adhik hoti he or yah bhavishya main tibi ke kai dawaaon ke prati pratirodh ke strens ke vikaas ko bhi rokatii he
 The use of dots reduces the likelihood of tuberculosis recurring, resulting in a reduction in the rate of successful treatment
 isamen yah tathy bhi shaamil he ki jin kshetron main dots ranneeti kaa upyog nahin kiye jaataa, vahaan aamtaur par suraksha ke kam maanak uplabdh karaaye jate hai
 In areas where dots are used, there are fewer patients expecting help for other facilities who are given unknown treatment and unknown results of this treatment
 haalanki agar dots kaarykram ko lagu nahin kiya jaataa yaa galat tareeke se lagu kiya jaataa he to sakaaratmak parinaamon kii sambhaavna nahin rahati he
 For this program to be implemented properly and effectively, healthcare providers have to make their full contribution, for this there should be good links between public and private physicians, health services should be available to all, and Provide world-class support to countries that are trying to achieve the goals of TB prevention and its treatment
 Minister added
 kuch shodhakartaaon kaa suzav he ki, kyonki dots pranali up-sahaara africa main tapedic ke upachaar main itani safal hui he ki dots kaa upyog asankramak rogon jaise madhumeh, ucch raktchaap or epilepsy jaise rogon ke upachaar main bhi kiya janaa chahiye
 In 1998, WHO expanded the DOTS program for the treatment of MDR-TB
 The implementation of the DOTS Plus program requires the ability of drug sensitivity testing and availability of second-line agents, in addition to all the requirements of DOTS
 isiilie dots plus dots kii tulana main adhik mahangaa padataa he or jo desh ise lagu karnaa chaahate hai, unhen iske prati adhik vachanabaddhata rakhni hogi
 Resource constraint implies that the implementation of dots-plus ignores the existing DOTS program and consequently drops the overall standard of care
 dots-plus ke liye tab tak masik nigaraanee raakhi jaati he jab tak culture kii report nakaaratmak main nahin badal jaati, lekin dots ke liye aisa nahin he
 If the culture is positive and the symptoms of the disease do not reappear after three months of treatment, then a re-examination of the patient is necessary for drug resistant disease or if no medication works
 agar teen maah kii therapy ke baad bhi culture nakaaratmak main nahin badalata, to kuch chikitsak rogi ko bhartee kar lete hai taaki uski upachaar prakriya par baariki se nigaraanee rakhi ja sake
 The tuberculosis that does not affect the pleura is called extra-pulmonary tuberculosis
 kendriya tantrica tantra kaa rog vishesh rup se is vargeekaran main shaamil nahin kiya jaataa he
 The United Nations and WHO recommend 2HREZ / 4HR; 2HREZ / 7HR is recommended in the United States
 yah kahana yadrichhik niyantrit pareekshan se ek acha pramaan he ki tubarkulosis limphadenitis main or merurajju ke tibi main, chah maah kaa upachaar nau maah kii avadhi ke upachaar ke baraabar he; isliye sanyukt rajya america ki salaah ko pramaanon kaa samarthan praapt nahin he
 In 25 percent of Lassanodes TB, the condition worsens before the patient is given treatment, and this often occurs in the first few months of treatment
 upachaar shuru kiye jane ke kuch saptaah baad hi, lasika nodes aakaar main bad jate hai or lasika nodes jo pehle thos the, ve kuch tarlikrut hone lagate hai
 But this cannot be said that treatment is failing and it usually causes unnecessary panic in patients
 dhairya rakhane par upachaar ke do se teen saptaah ke bheetar lasika nodes phir se sankuchit hone lagate hai or is samay lasika parvon kii phir se biopsy karne yaa phir se jaanch karne kii koi aavashyaktaa nahin hoti he: yadi phir se sukshmajaivik adhyayan ke aadesh die jate hai, to is jaanch main samaan samvedansheeltaa praturup ke saath jivit jeevanuon kii upasthiti gyaat hogi, jo phir se bhram main daal sakati he: is samay aksar jo chikitsak tibi ke upachaar main anbhavi nahin hote, aksar yah maan kar duusari pankti kii dawaaen shuru kar dete hai, ki upachaar kargar nahin he
 In these situations, only assurance is required
 steroid sujan ko kam karne main upyogi ho sakate hai, vishesh rup se tab inkaa upyog kiya janaa chahie jab isamen bahut dard hota ho, lekin ye jaruri nahin hai
 There is no need for additional antibiotics and this unnecessarily increases the length of treatment
 tapedic kendriya tantrika tantra ko prabhavit kar saktaa he, mastishk or merurajju), in maamalon main yah kramshah tibi meninzitis, tibi cerabritis, tibi myelitis kehalaata he; iske maanak upachaar ke rup main baarah maheene dawaaen di jaati hai or steroid anivaary hai
 Diagnosis is difficult because CSF culture is positive in less than half of cases, and therefore most cases are treated only on the basis of clinical suspicion
 siesuef kaa pisiar sukshmajaivik upaj ko pramanit nahin karata; culture sabase samvedi vidhi he or kam se kam 5 millilitre siesuef ko vishleshan ke liye bheja jaataa he
 Diagnosis in TB cerebritis may require brain biopsy, as CSF is usually normal: it is not always available, some physicians do not justify it, they say, even when testing for tb-resistant therapy Can give the same result, then what is the need for a patient to undergo such an aggressive and dangerous process; Perhaps brain biopsy is justified only when drug-resistant TB is suspected
 aisa bhi sambhav he ki tibi meninzitis ke upachaar ke liye choti avadhi kii chikitsa paryaapt ho, lekin koi chikitsakeey pareekshan ise pramanit nahin karata he
 Even after treatment for TB meningitis, the patient's CSF remains abnormal for 12 months; This abnormality has no relation to medical progress or outcome, and does not indicate that there is a need to further extend or repeat the treatment; Therefore, the CSF sample should not be repeated by the lumbar puncture to monitor the progress of treatment
 haalanki tibi mainingitis or tibi cerabritis ko ek saath vargeekrut kiya jaataa he, kai chikitsakon kaa anubhav yah he ki upachaar ke liye pratikriya samaan nahin hoti
 tibi mainingitis aamtaur par ilaaj ke liye acchhee tarah se pratikriya detaa he, lekin tibi cerabritis ke liye lambe upachaar kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he or steroid course kii aavashyaktaa lambi avadhi tak ho sakati he
 Unlike TB meningitis, CT or MRI imaging of the brain is often required to monitor progress in TB cerebritis
 sienes tibi rakt se failane kii drushti se madhyamik ho saktaa he: isliye kuch visheshgy milliyari tibi ke rogiyon main siesuef ke semple niyamit rup se lene kii salaah dete hai
 The anti-tb drugs that are most useful for the treatment of CNS TB are: steroid kaa prayog tibi mainingitis main niyamit rup se kiya jaataa he 
 ek pareekshan se yah bhi pataa chalaa he ki aspirin bhi phydemand hoti he, lekin isse pehle ki ise niyamit rup se kaam main liya jaye, is par aage or kaary karne kii aavashyaktaa he
 The utility of corticosteroid for the treatment of TB meningitis and TB pericarditis has also been proven
 tibi mainingitis ke liye dexamethason kii 8 se 12 milligram kii khuraaq pratidin 6 saptaah se adhik samay ke liye di jaati he pericarditis ke liye prednisolon kii 60 milligram khuraaq pratidin chaar se aath saptaah ke liye di jaati he
 Steroids may provide temporary benefits in pleurisy, extremely advanced TB and children's TB
 steroid peritonitis, milliyari rog, swaryantr kaa tibi, limphadenitis or mutr janayah purna rup se pramanit nahin he or steroid ke niyamit upyog kii salaah nahin di ja sakati
 The use of steroid treatment in these patients depends on the case that is decided by the physician
 thelidomide tibi mainingitis main laabhakaari ho saktaa he or iskaa upyog un maamalon main kiya gaya he jinamein rogi steroid upachaar ke liye pratikriya nahin detaa
 Patients who do not treat TB regularly and reliably have a significantly increased likelihood of failure of treatment, recurrence of the disease, or even more likely to develop a claim resistant TB variant
 aise kai kaaran hai jinaki vajah se rogi apana ilaaj puraa nahin le pate
 aamtaur par tibi ke lakshan upachaar shuru hone ke kuch saptaah main hi kam hone lagate hai or is samay kai rogi laaparvaah ho jate hai or dawa lenaa band kar dete hai
 It is necessary to take continuous medication for its complete treatment, it should also be checked from time to time that there is no problem in the patient
 rogiyon ko yah bataaya janaa jaruri he ki unhen niyamit rup se apni dawa leni chahie, upachaar ko puraa kiya janaa bahut mahatvapurn he, kyonki aisa na karne se rog phir se ho saktaa he or dawa ke liye pratirodh bhi utpann ho saktaa he
 One of the main complaints is that its pills are very large
 sabase badi pijede he 
isaki jagah pijede vikalp ke rup main syrup bhi diya ja saktaa he, yaa or agar goli kaa aakaar vastav main bahut bada he or iskaa syrup vikalp uplabdh nahin he to pijede ko puri tarah se hataaya ja saktaa he
 If PZA is removed, the patient should be warned that it may increase the duration of the disease
 ek duusari shikaayat yah rahati he ki is dawa ko khali pet lene kii salaah di jaati he tak iskaa avasorana jaldi ho
 This makes it difficult for patients at times and hence the patient has to wake up an hour early from their routine just to take medicines
 ye niyam vastav main itane kade nahin hai jitna ki aksar chikitsakon ke dwaara bataaye jate hai: vastav main baat yah he ki agar arempi ko vasa ke saath liya jaye to iske avasorana kii gati dhimi ho jaati he, lekin protein, carbohydrate or amlarodhi iske avasorana ko prabhavit nahin karte hai
 Therefore, the patient can take medicine with such food which does not contain fat or oil
 Taking food medicine does not cause nausea, which most patients take on an empty stomach medicine
 ienech ke avasorana par bhojan kaa prabhaav spasht nahin he: so adhyayanon main pataa chalaa he ki bhojan ke saath avasorana kam ho jaataa he jabaki ek adhyayan main kisi prakaar kaa antar gyaat nahin hua
 Food has little effect on absorption of PZA and EMB, which is probably not clinically significant
 dawa thik se lee ja rahi he yaa nahin, iskaa pataa lagane ke liye mutr pareekshan main isoniyazid or rifampicin ke str kii jaanch kii ja sakati he
 The interpretation of urine analysis is based on the fact that isoniazid has a longer half-life than rifampicin: jin deshon main doctor rogi ko dawa lene ke liye majaboor nahin kar sakate, vahaan par doctoron kaa kahana he ki mutr pareekshan zyada madadgaar nahin hota he, isse rogi dawa lenaa shuru nahin karata he
 Urine testing is helpful in countries where legal pressure can be put on the patient to take medicine

 Once peripheral neuropathy occurs, INH should be stopped and a dose of 50 ml of pyridoxine should be given three times daily
 After the neuropathy, only the high dose of pyridoxine is included in the drug, the neuropathy will not stop increasing
 jin rogiyon main anya kaarnon se neuropethy kaa jokhim hota he unhen upachaar kii shuruyaat main roj pyridokasin kii 10 milligram maatra di jaati he

 During treatment, fever can also occur due to several reasons
 yah tapedic ke ek swaabhaavik prabhaav ke rup main bhi ho saktaa he
 Fever can also be caused by resistance to a drug
 Fever can also be caused by another infection or any additional diagnosis
 In some patients, fever may also be due to allergy to a medicine
 chikitsak ko is sambhaavna ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki tibi kaa nidaan galat kiya ja rahaa he
 If the patient has been in treatment for more than two weeks and the fever had initially gone away, then it is appropriate to stop all TB drugs for 72 hours
 agar tibi kii sabhi dawaaen band kar dene ke baad bhi bukhaar bana rahata he, to bukhaar dawaaon ke kaaran nahin he
 If fever is stopped by discontinuing medications, then every medicine should be tested separately to find out which drug is causing the fever
 dawa se hone vaale hepatitis ke liye bhi isi tareeke kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 It is often noted that the drug responsible for fever is RMP: a detailed description is given in the entry on rifampicin
 tibi ke ilaaj se hone vaali ekmaatr sabase badi samasya he dawaaon ke kaaran hepatitis ho janaa, jisamen mrityu dar lagbhag 5 pratishat hoti he
 Three drugs can induce hepatitis: PZA, INH and RMP
 It is not possible to differentiate between these three causes based on symptoms
 koun si dawa iske liye uttaradaayi he isaki jaanch ke liye pareekshan khuraaq di jaani chahie 
 a liver function test should be done at the beginning of treatment, but, if it is normal, there is no need to test it again; The patient is only warned about the symptoms of hepatitis
 kuch chikitsak upachaar ke dauraan lft ke niyamit pareekshan par jor dete hai or is maamle main, pareekshan upachaar shuru kiye jane ke do saptaah baad hi kiya jaataa he or iske baad har do maheene baad yah jaanch kii jaati he, jab tak koi samasya na dikhaai de
 There is a possibility of bilirubin increasing with RMP treatment, usually this problem is resolved after 10 days
 Increased bilirubin levels can be safely ignored
 upachaar ke pehle teen saptahon main yakrut transaminess kaa badhanaa saamaanya he
 If no such symptoms appear in the patient and the level of any of these secretions does not increase very much, then no action is required; Some experts suggest that a fourfold increase from their upper normal limit can be neglected, but there is no evidence to support this number
 kuch visheshgyon kaa vichaar he ki upachaar ko keval tabhi roka janaa chahie agar pilia naidanik rup se spasht ho jaye
 If clinically apparent hepatitis appears, all drugs should be stopped until the level of liver transaminases is normalized
 If the patient is so ill that treatment cannot be stopped, STM and EMB should be given until the level of transaminase is normal

agar rogi 9 din kii pareekshan khuraaq le letaa he, to yah pataa lagaaya ja saktaa he ki pijede ke kaaran hepatitis hua he or pijede kii pareekshan khuraaq kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 The reason for using drug testing is that the two main drugs to treat TB are INH and RMP, so they are tested first: PZA is most likely to cause hepatitis and is also one such drug Which can be easily removed
 iembi us samay upyogi hoti he jab tibi ke jeevanu kaa samvedansheeltaa praturup gyaat nahin hota or ise hataaya ja saktaa he agar yah jeevanu ienech ke liye samvedi ho

 Intolerance or resistance to EMB is rare
 agar koi rogi vastav main ashishnu he yaa iembi pratirodhi tibi se sankramit he, to 2HRZ / 4HR bilkul sweekaarya upachaar he
 EMB has no role in the treatment of TB that is sensitive to both INH and RMP and is only included in the initial treatment due to the increased rate of INH resistance if INH resistance rates are less known
 If the infectious TB variant is known to be sensitive to INH, there is no need to use EMB

 If the use of aminoglycoside cannot be ignored, serum levels should be monitored closely and the patient should be warned of the possibility of side effects
 Aminoglycosides can be used if the patient's renal failure is in its final stages and the kidneys are no longer doing any specific work, but only when the level of the drug can be easily checked

 Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis is the type of TB that is least resistant to INH and RMP
 ve isolats jo tibi-rodhi dawaaon ke kisi or sangyojan ke liye pratirodh ko badhaate hai, lekin ienech or arempi ke liye pratirodhi nahin hai, unhen MDR-TB kii shrenee main nahin rakhaa jaataa he
 According to the definition given in October 2006, "massive drug-resistant tuberculosis" is defined as MDR-TB resistant to quinolone and resistant to either kanamycin, capriomycin, or amikacin
 xdr-tibi kii puraane maamle kii paribhaasha MDR-TB he jo bhi teen yaa duusari pankti kii dawaaon ke chah se adhik virgon ke liye pratirodhi he
 This definition should no longer be used, but it is included here because many older versions use it
 mdr-tibi or xdr-tibi donon ke upachaar ke liye samaan siddhant hai
 The main difference is that XDR-TB has a higher mortality rate than MDR-TB, as it has a smaller number of effective treatment options
 xdr-tibi ke mahamari vigyaan kaa vartmaan main acchhee tarah se adhyayan nahin kiya gaya he, lekin yah mana jaataa he ki XDR-TB aasaani se swasth aabaadi main sancharit nahin hota he, lekin yah aisi aabaadi main mahamari kaa rup le saktaa he jo pehle se hi echivi se peedit he isliye unamem tibi ke sankraman kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 According to a survey conducted in 35 countries in 1997, its rate was more than 2 percent in about one third of the countries surveyed

 Similarly, high rates of MDR-TB were found in New York City in the early 1990s, coinciding with the end of a public health program implemented by the Reagan administration
 mdr-tibi puri tarah se samvedansheel tibi ke upachaar ke dauraan viksit ho saktaa he or aisa aksar rogi ke dwaara koi khuraaq na lene yaa upachaar puraa na karne ke kaaran hota he
 Thankfully, MTR-TB strains are less fit and have lower transmission efficiency
 kai saalon se yah gyaat he ki ienech pratirodhi tibi gini pig main kam vishakt he or jaanapadik rog vigyaan kaa pramaan yah he ki tibi ke MDR upbhed swaabhaavik rup se adhik prabhavi nahin hai
 a study conducted in Los Angeles found only 6% of MDR-TB cases
 yah santosh kaa vishay nahin hona chahie: yah yaad rakhana chahie ki mdr-tibi ke kaaran mrityu dar phuffus cancer ke kaaran mrityu dar ke saath tulaneey he
 It should also be remembered that people whose immune system is weakened are more likely to get TB infection
 vartmaan main xdr-tibi dakshin africa ke liye ek mahamari he
 The outbreak was discovered when 53 patients were found in a rural hospital in kwazulu-natal, out of which 52 died
 isamen chintaa kii mukhya baat yah thi ki thook kaa namoona lene ke baad sirf 16 dinon ke bheetar in rogiyon kii mrityu ho gayi, jabaki inamen se adhikansh rogiyon ne pehle kabhi tibi kaa upachaar nahin liya tha
 It is an epidemic for which XDR-TB was first abbreviated, although strains of TB that give current definitions of TB have been identified, by far the largest group of related cases
 Was
 sitambar 2006 kii praarambhik report ke baad se, ab dakshin africa ke adhikansh praanton main maamle saamne aaye hai
 As of 16 March 2007, 314 cases had been registered, of which 215 died
 yah spasht he ki tibi ke is upbhed kaa prasar echivi or sankraman ke aparyaapt niyantran se sambandhit he; anya deshon main jahaan XDR-TB ke upbhed utpann hue hai, maamle kaa upyukt prabandhan na kiye jane ke kaaran dawa ke liye pratirodh viksit hua, yaa rogi ke dwaara upachaar ko thik prakaar se na lene ke kaaran aisa hua
 This strain of TB does not respond to any drugs currently available in South Africa, for the first and second line
 It is now clear that this problem has been done longer than stated by the authorities and it is more widespread than that
 23 navambar 2006 tak XDR-TB ke 303 maamle darj kiye ja chuke hai, jinamein se 263 maamle kwazulu-netal main darj kiye gaye
 The exclusion of TB patients is a serious consideration, with many considering it a violation of the patient's human rights, but it may be necessary to prevent further spread of this strain of TB
 mdr-tibi kaa upachaar or nidaan sankraman ke bajaay bahut kuch cancer se miltaa julata he
 It has a mortality rate of up to 80 percent, which depends on many factors, these factors include: upachaar kii avadhi kam se kam 18 maheene kii hoti he or isamen ek saal bhi lag ekta he; isamen shalya chikitsa kii aavashyaktaa bhi pad sakati he, haalanki ishtatam upachaar ke baavjood mrityu dar adhik hoti he
 That said, good results are still possible
 upachaar kam se kam 18 maah kii avadhi kaa hota he or isamen pratyaksh prekshan kaa avyav upachaar kii safalataa ko 69 pratishat tak badha saktaa he
 MDR-TB should be treated only by a physician who is experienced in treating MDR-TB
 visheshgy kendron main upachaar lene vaale rogiyon kii tulana main gaiyr visheshgy kendron main upachaar lene vaale rogiyon main mrityu dar adhik pai gayi he
 Apart from the obvious risks, other risks are also seen such as male sex, HIV infection, earlier TB, failure of TB treatment, non-response to standard TB treatment and relapse of the disease after standard treatment of TB
 Grow from mdr-tibi kaa upachaar samvedansheeltaa pareekshan ke aadhaar par kiya janaa chahie: is jaankaree ke bina aise rogiyon kaa upachaar asambhav he
 If a patient suspected of MDR-TB is being treated, treatment of the patient should be started with SHREZ + MXF + cycloserine based on laboratory sensitivity testing
 kuch deshon main rpob ke liye ek jin jaanch uplabdh he or yah MDR -tibi ke liye ke upyogi marker kaa kaam karata he, kyonki isolated arempi pratirodh durlabh he ke parinaam sakaaratmak aate hai to arempi ko hataa kar shez+mxf+cychlocerin kaa upyog kiya janaa chahie
 The reason for placing the patient on INH, despite the suspicion of MDR-TB, is that INH is so powerful in the treatment of TB that it would be foolish to remove it until microbial evidence is found that it is ineffective
 isoniyazid-pratirodh ke liye bhi jaanch uplabdh he, lekin ye adhik vyapak rup se uplabdh nahin hai
 When the sensitivity is known and the isolate is definitively found to be resistant to both INH and RMP, five drugs should be selected in the following order: dawaaon ko suchi main sabase upar rakhaa jaataa he kyonki ve adhik prabhavi or kam vishakt hai; dawaaon ko suchi main sabase neeche rakhaa jaataa he kyonki ve kam prabhavi or adhik vishakt hai, yaa unhen praapt karne main kathinaayee hoti he
 Resistance to a drug within a class means that there is usually resistance to all drugs in that class, but rifampicin is a notable exception: resistance to rifampicin does not always mean resistance to rifabutin and is investigated in the laboratory Is called for
 dawa ke prayek varg main keval ek dawa kaa upyog karnaa hi sambhav he
 If it is difficult to find five medicines for treatment, then the doctor can request that a high level of inh-resistance be investigated
 If the strains have only a low level of inh-resistance then higher doses of INH can be used as part of the treatment
 dawaaon ko jari rakhane ke saath, PZA or interferon kaa count shunya ho jaataa he; arthath, chaar dawaaon ke saath PZA ko shaamil karne se, aap paanch karne ke liye ek dawa kaa chayan or kar sakate hai
 It is not possible to use more than one injection drug, as the toxic effect of these drugs may be slightly: if possible, aminoglycosides should be given daily for at least three months
 Ciprofloxacin should not be used in the treatment of tuberculosis if other fluoroquinolones are available
 mdr-tibi main upyog ke liye koi aantrayik upachaar nahin he, parantu chikitsakeey anubhav yah he ki saptaah main paanch din ke liye injection se di jane vaali dawaaon kaa bura parinaam nahin hota
 Directly observed therapy certainly helps improve the outcomes of MDR-TB and should be considered an integral part of the treatment of MDR-TB
 upachaar ke liye kya pratikriya ho rahi he, iskaa pataa lagane ke liye baar baar thook kaa culture kiya ja saktaa he 
mdr-tibi kaa upachaar kam se kam 18 maheene ke liye diya janaa chahie or ise tab tak nahin rokna chahie jab tak ki rogi kaa culture kam se kam nau maheene ke liye nakaaratmak naa ho jaye
 mdr-tibi ke rogiyon main do saal yaa adhik samay ke liye upachaar karnaa asaamaanya nahin he
 MDR-TB patients should be kept separately in a negative pressure room if possible
 mdr-tibi ke rogiyon ko usee ward main nahin rakhaa janaa chahie jisamen pratirakshadaman ke rogiyon ko rakhaa gaya he
 Compliance with treatment should be carefully monitored for the management of MDR-TB
 According to some physicians, the patient should be kept aside until his smear becomes negative, or only the culture becomes negative
 It is practically impossible to keep the patient in the hospital for several weeks or months, and the final decision depends on the physician treating the patient
 chikitsak ko vishakt prabhaav se bachane ke liye or anupaalan par nigaraanee rakhane ke liye dawaaon kaa purna upyog karnaa chahie
 Some supplements may be useful in the treatment of tuberculosis, but for the purpose of continuing MDR-TB drugs, they are calculated to be zero
 , haalanki ise thik prakaar se nahin bataaya gaya he ki yah jaldi kii jaani chahie yaa der se
 Patients who respond to treatment and recover after completion of the course of TB treatment are not categorized as treatment failure, but relapse is described separately in a section below
 ek marij kaa upachaar asafal tab kaha jaataa he agar vah Those patients who fail treatment are treated differently from patients in whom the disease relapses after healing
 ek rogi ko relaps tabhi kaha jaataa he jab vah upachaar le kara thik ho jaataa he lekin upachaar chhodane ke baad usamen phir se rog utpann ho jaataa he, relaps kaa varnan alag se ek khand main diya gaya he
 It is very uncommon for a patient not to respond to treatment, as it expresses basic resistance to all medications in treatment
 jo marij upachaar ke liye bilkul bhi pratikriya nahin karte, unase bahut baariki se poochtacha kii jaani chahie ki ve apni dawa thik se le rahe hai yaa nahin or zarurat ho to unke upachaar kaa prekshan karne ke liye unhen aspataal main bhartee kar lenaa chahie
 Blood or urine samples can be taken to check if TB drugs are absorbed properly
 agar ve thik se dawa le rahen hai or dawa kaa avasorana bhi ho rahaa he to aisi sambhaavna hoti he ki unka koi or nidaan kiya janaa chahie 
 in rogiyon kaa nidaan bahut dhyanpurvak kiya janaa chahie or tibi culture or samvedansheeltaa pareekshan ke namoonon kaa adhyayan bhalee prakaar se kiya janaa chahie
 Those patients first become somewhat better, after which their health begins to deteriorate again, they should be questioned to monitor compliance with treatment
 agar anupaalan kii pushti ho jaati he, to pratirodhi tibi ke liye unki jaanch kii jaani chahie, chaahe upachaar shuru karne se pehle sookshm jaiviki ke liye pehle se namoona liya ja chukaa ho
 Any type of mistake in the prescription or taking of a medication can be the reason that the patient does not respond to treatment
 Immune defects are a rare reason for not showing a response

 In a proportion of patients, all medical and surgical options for treatment cease and when such a situation occurs, the patient and his family should be informed that the patient is likely to die of TB
 aise samay main rogi ko manovaigyanik samarthan dena chahie, uski poshan aavashyaktaaon or shwasan ke lakshanon par dhyaan kendrit karnaa chahie, taaki uski mrityu sammanjanak ho
 a patient is classified as relapse when he or she recovers on treatment but becomes ill again after stopping treatment
 ve rogi jinamein upachaar karne par kshanik sudhaar hota he, yaa jo upachaar ke liye kabhi bhi pratikriya pradarshit nahin karte, unhen vifal upachaar kii shrenee main rakhaa jaataa he, jiskaa vivaran upar diya gaya he
 Relapse has a lower rate that relates to treatment, which can also occur when the patient has properly taken medications with 100 percent compliance
 adhikansh baar relaps upachaar ke puraa hone ke baad 6 maah ke bheetar hi ho jaataa he
 Relapse is often more likely in patients who take their medications irregularly
 relaps karne vaale rogiyon main pratirodh kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he or inamen namoonay lene ke sabhi prayaas kiye jane chahie, taaki samvedansheeltaa kii jaanch ke liye inkaa culture kiya ja sake
 Most patients who relapse with fully sensory strains are likely to have relapsed in such patients, but have instead relapsed; Such patients can be treated with the same medicines as before
 
 The World Health Organization recommends treatment with 2SHREZ / 6HRE when microbial evidence is not available
 This treatment is designed for optimal treatment of fully sensitive TB
 It also covers the possibility of nh-resistant TB
 jivan bhar relaps ke jokhim ke kaaran, sabhi rogiyon ko upachaar puraa hone par relaps ke lakshanon kii chetavanee di jaati he or unhen sakht nirdesh die jate hai ki agar unhen aise koi bhi lakshan dikhaai den to turant doctor ke paas jaaen
 In areas where TB is a highly endemic disease, it is not uncommon for a patient to have fever, but no source of infection is found
 In such a situation, the doctor after examination examines all the diseases and examines the treatment of TB
 iske liye kam se teen saptaah ke liye HEZ se upachaar kiya jaataa he; upachaar main se RMP or STM ko hataa diya jaataa he kyonki ve vyapak spectrum antibiotic hai, jabaki anya teen pehali pankti kii dawaaen keval micobacterial sankraman kaa upachaar karti hai
 The persistence of fever even after three months of treatment is a good proof of TB and at this time the patient should start conventional treatment of TB
 agalgar bukhaar upachaar ke teen maah baad thik nahin hota to yah bhi ho saktaa he ki rogi kaa bukhar kisi or kaaran se he
 This approach is without criticism, arguing that all such patients should be given TB treatment
 1940 ke dashak ke baad se shalya chikitsa ne tapedic ke prabandhan main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai he
 The first successful treatment for tuberculosis was by surgery
 ve is avlokan par aadhaarit tha ki thik ho chuke tapedic kii sabhi gufaaen bhar chuki thim
 Therefore, an attempt is made to fill open caves for treatment in surgery
 in sabhi prakriyaaon kaa upyog purv antibiotic yug main kiya gaya
 There is a myth that surgeons believe that the TB organism should not allow oxygen to pass: although it is a well-known fact that this organism survives under aerial conditions
 haalanki vartmaan maanakon main in prakriyaaon ko barbar mana jaataa he, yah yaad rakhaa janaa chahie ki ye upachaar rog ke liye sambhavi ilaaj he, kyonki isamen mrityu dar kam se kam utani buree hoti he jitani ki phuffus cancer main hoti he
 In this, pneumothorax was always cured and this process was repeated after a few weeks
 pangu banaaya ja chukaa diafram iske baad uapra uthaa jaataa tha or us or kaa phuffus nasht ho jaataa tha, jisase gupha band ho jaati thi
 Six to eight ribs were broken and pushed into the thoracic cavity so that the lower part of the pleura could be destroyed
 yah ek barbar shalya chikitsa thi, lekin isamen prakriya ko phir se dohraane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti thi
 In the 1940s and 1950s it was impossible to recover the infected pleural, as anesthetic science was not advanced enough at the time to make the pleural surge unconscious
 aadhunik samay main, tapedic kii shalya chikitsa, kai dawaaon se pratirodhi tibi ke prabandhan tak hi simit he
 In patients with MDR-TB whose culture remains positive even after several months of treatment, lobectomy or pneumonectomy is used to cut the infected tissue
 shalya chikitsa ke liye upyukt samay nirdhaarit nahin he or shalya chikitsa ke baad bhi rugnataa bani rah sakati he
 There is a center in America that has the most experience
 yah centre denwar, colorado main neshnal juish medical and research centre he
 From 1983 to 2000, he performed 180 surgeries in 172 patients; Of these, 98 were lobectomies and 82 were pneumonectomies

 Some complications were found even after treatment of tuberculosis after surgery, such as recurrent hemoptysis, pleural effusion or empyema
 phuffus ke alaava kisi anya ang ke tibi main, shalya chikitsa aksar nidaan ke liye aavashyak hoti he : lasika parvon kii sargical chantai, phode main se srav, utak biopsy, aadi iske udhaaharan hai
 Samples taken for TB culture should be sent to the laboratory after being kept in a sterilized vessel, taking care that no foreign matter is found in it and it should be delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible
 jahaan taral culture kii suvidha uplabdh he, nirjarmikrut sthaan se namoonay ko sidhe prakriya sthaan main daal diya janaa chahie; isse parinaam main sudhaar aata he

 Knowledge of the relationship between TB and malnutrition is necessary, it can avoid delay in diagnosis and improve the healing process

 Decreased vitamin d levels illustrate a greater likelihood of tuberculosis in African Americans, and it also explains why photo therapy is effective for lupus vulgaris, because the skin naturally appears when exposed to sunlight
 Vitamin d is produced in it
 ek mudda yah bhi he ki tapedic kaa upachaar vitamin di ke str ko kam kar detaa he, lekin yah chikitsa main koi vyaavhaarik mudda nahin he
 Genetic differences in vitamin d receptors affect susceptibility to tuberculosis in West African, Gujarati, and Chinese populations, but no data exist in any population indicating that vitamin d supplementation affects susceptibility to TB
 
 jin rogiyon main vitamin di kii kami hoti he, unhen vitamin di dena laabhakaari hota he
 In a subset of patients with tt genotype of the taqi vitamin d receptor, who are deficient in vitamin D, vitamin d supplementation leads to rapid conversion of sputum culture
 saamaanya vitamin di ke str vaale rogiyon ko vitamin di kaa poorak dene se tibi ke pariprekshya main koi phayda nahin hota
 In the mid-19th century it was observed that cod liver oil was beneficial for patients with tuberculosis, and the fact behind it is that it strengthened the immune system for tuberculosis

 Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection is essential for the control and eradication of TB, it reduces the risk that TB infection can turn into disease
 iske liye sadiyon se "rokthaam therapy" or "kemoprophylaxis" shabdon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he or sanyukt raashtra main ise praathamikta diya jaati he kyonki isamen un rogiyon ko daawa di jaati he jinamein rog ke sakriy lakshan nahin hai or ve vartmaan main thik hai, upachaar praathmik rup se isliye kiya jaataa he taaki logon ko biimaar hone se roka ja sake
 The term "latent tuberculosis treatment" takes precedence in the United States because the claim does not actually prevent infection: it prevents the existing silent infection from becoming active
 sanyukt rajya america main "LTBI kaa upachaar" shabd logon ko yah samajhaata he ki ve rog kaa upachaar le rahen hai
 There is no reason to prefer one word over another
 yah jaruri he ki LTBI kaa upachaar shuru karne se pehle sakriy tibi kii jaanch kii jaye
 jis vyakti main sakriy tibi use yadi LTBI kaa upachaar diya jaataa he to yah ek gambhir galati hogi: isse tibi kaa upachaar upyukt rup se nahin hoga or tibi ke dawa pratirodhi upabhedon ke viksit hone kaa jokhim bhi bad jaayegaa

 1980 ke dashak ke aate aate unics sabase lokapriy, shakti shaali, evam sthir auparating system ban gaya haalanki us samay tak uske kai roopaantar aa chuke the
 Unix had one drawback - it is difficult to understand and operate
 andrew tenenbam, aimusterdam main computer vigyaan ke professor hai
 He wrote a program called Minix to help it
 isamen bhi kuch kamiyaan thim
 Linus Torvald was a computer science student at the University of Helsinki, Finland
 unhone minix kii kami ko dur karne ke liye ek program likhaa jo ki baad main ‘linus kaa unics’ yaa chote main linaks kahalaaya
 His first core or Karnal was posted in Internet in 1991
 tab tak richard stallmen kaa 'gnu' project shuru ho chukaa tha
 Linus Torvald took many programs from this in his Linux
 isliye richard stallmen kaa kahana he
 That it should be called 'gnu-linux'
 par yah naam, shaayad lambaa rahane ke kaaran chal nahin paaya
 But this does not mean that the GNU project is not involved in the success of Linux
 gnew project ke bina linaks sambhav nahin tha
 The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented at AT & T's Bell Laboratories in the United States in 1969 by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas mcilroy and Joe Ossan
 unics pehali baar 1971 main relies hua, or puri tarah se assembly bhashaa main likhaa gaya tha, jaisaa ki us samay aam abhyaas tha
 Later, in a major pioneering approach in 1973, it was written by Dennis Ritchie in some programming language
 unics ke ucch stareey bhashaa karyanvayan kii uplabdhta ne vibhinn computer platformon ko apane porting ko aasaan bana diya
 Due to an antitrust case prior to entering the Computer Enterprise case, AT&T was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone
 natijatan, unics jaldi bad gaya or academik sansthaanon or vyavsaayon dwaara vyapak rup se apanaaya gaya
 In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; Free of legal liability requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where users were not legally allowed to modify Unix
 richard stollman dwaara 1983 main shuru hui jienyu pariyojna kaa lakshya "purna unics-sangat software system" banane kaa lakshya tha jo puri tarah se muft software se bana tha
 Work began in 1984
 baad main, 1985 main, stallman ne free software foundation kii shuruyaat kii or 1989 main jienyu general public license likhaa
 By the early 1990s, many programs (text editors, Unix shells, and a windowing system) required in an operating system were complete, although device drivers, daemons, and kernels, called GNU / Herd, were low-level
 The elements were intercepted and incomplete
 linas torwaldas ne kaha he ki yadi us samay jienyu karnel uplabdh to, usne apana khud kaa likhane kaa faisla nahin kiya hoga
 Minix was created by computer science professor Andrew S
 Tanenbaum, and was released in 1987 as an Unix-like operating system targeted at students and others who wanted to learn operating system principles
 haalanki MINIX kaa puraa strot code swatantra rup se uplabdh tha, licencing sharton ne april 2000 main licencing badalane tak ise muft software hone se roka

 The modern Tajik language has deep influences from the Russian language, the Uzbeki language and the Uygur language
 kuch farsi-bhashi log tajiki ko irani farsi se zyaada shuddh maanate hai, kyonki iran par arab akraman or qabze ke baad bahut baari arabi bhashaa kaa prabhaav padaa
 Arabic words are less in Tajik Persian than in Iranian Persian and more are of ancient Persian origin

 Historically, ancient Aryan religion, Buddhism and Zarathushtri religion have been emphasized among the Tajik people

 haalanki bryant ke tatkaaleen agent orn telem ke anusaar, bryant kaa charlot hornats ke liye khelan "asambhav" si baat he
 But Hornets' then head scout Bill Branch said that the Hornets agreed to sell their draft selection to the Lakers just one day before the draft

 Bryant's fortunes backfired with Phil Jackson becoming coach of the Los Angeles Lakers in 1999
 After years of continuous improvement, Bryant was named among the league's outstanding shooting guards and this led to him playing in the league's all-nba, all-star, and all-defensive teams
 Bryant and Shakeel became one of the major contenders for the Los Angeles Lakers Championship under o'neill
 in donon kaa centre-guard kaa sangyojan kaaphi prabhaavshaalee sabit hua

 1999-2000 ke satr kii shuruyaat se pehle washington vijards ke viruddh ek khel main haath main chot lag jane ke kaaran bryant ko chah hafton ke liye baahar baithna padaa

 o'neill was then declared MVP and Bryant was named to the all-nba Team Second Team and all-nba Defensive Team for the first time in his career
 Although he played as an associate of o'neill in the playoffs, his performance in some games was extremely impressive such as his 25 points, 11 rebounds, 7 assists, and 4 blocks in the seventh game against the Portland Trail Blazers in the Western Conference Finals
 Figure of An allie-oop pass thrown by him to o'neill helped him win that game and series
 Bryant suffered an ankle injury in the second quarter of the second game of the 2000 NBA Finals against the Indiana Pacers, forcing him to sit out of that game and the next game
 In the second half of the fourth game, Bryant scored 22 points, which helped the team win in extra time
 In that game o'neill was ruled out due to more fouls

 He once had the best in the team with an average of 5 assists per game
 However, the Lakers won just 56 games, 11 short of the previous year's performance
 iske baad lekars ne plaofs main 15-1 kaa shandaar pradarshan kiya
 They easily defeated the Portland Trail Blazers, the Sacramento Kings, and the San Antonio Spurs, but suffered their first defeat in extra time against the Philadelphia 76ers
