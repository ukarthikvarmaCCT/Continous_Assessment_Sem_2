 The Lucknow Pact is an agreement made by the Indian National Congress and the All India Muslim League in December 1916, passed by the Indian National Congress at the Lucknow Session on 29 December 1916 and the All India Muslim League on 31 December 1916
 bhartiya raajnneeti main jinna kaa udai 1916 main congress ke ek netaa ke rup main hua tha, jinhone hindu-muslim ekta par jor dete hue muslim lig ke saath lakhanu samjhauta karavaaya tha
 Significantly, in 1910 AD, he was elected a member of the Central Legislative Council from the Muslim constituency of Bombay, joined the Muslim League in 1913 and became its president in 1916 AD
 mohammad ali jinnah akhil bhartiya muslim lig ke adhyaksh kii haisiyat se sanvaidhanik sudhaaron kii sanyukt congress lig yojana pesh kii
 Under this scheme, the Congress League agreement provided for giving more representation to Muslims in separate constituencies and provinces in which they were in minority
 isi samjhaute ko 'lakhanu samjhauta' kehete hai
 The liberal and conservative groups of the Indian National Congress were reunited at the Lucknow meeting
 is samjhaute main bharat sarkaar ke dhaanche or hindu tathaa musalmaan samudaayon ke bich sambandhon ke bare main praavdhaan tha
 Mohammed Ali Jinnah and Bal Gangadhar Tilak were the major producers of the deal
 bal gangadhar tilak ko desh lakhanu samjhauta or kesari akhbaar ke liye yaad karata he
 According to earlier, these proposals were to advance the political legislation of Gopal Krishna Gokhale
 inamen praavdhaan tha ki prantiy or kendriya vidhayikaon kaa teen-chauthai hissaa vyapak matadhikaar ke jaariye chunaa jaye or kendriya kaaryakari parishad ke sadasyon sahit kaaryakari parishadon ke aadhe sadsy parishadon dwaara hi chune gaye bhartiya hon
 These proposals were generally included in the Government of India Act of 1919, excluding the provision of the Central Executive

 This agreement was not liked by some areas and special groups, but it paved the way for hindu-muslim cooperation for Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation Movement and Khilafat Movement since 1920
 jinna bhartiya rashtriya congress ke samarthak the, parantu gandhiji ke asahyog andolan kaa unhone teevr virodh kiya or isi prashn par congress se vah alag ho gaye
 From then on, the ghost of the fear of establishing a Hindu kingdom came upon him
 unhen yah galat fahami ho gai ki hindu bahul hindustan main musalamaanon ko uchit pratinidhitiv kabhi nahin mil sakegaa
 So he became a great supporter and campaigner of the establishment of a new nation Pakistan
 unka kahana tha ki angrez log jab bhi satta kaa hastantaran karen, unhen use hinduon ke haath main na saunpen, haalaanki vah bahumat main hai
 By doing this, Indian Muslims will have to live under Hindu rule

 He continued to receive general diplomatic support of the British and as a result he eventually emerged as the leader of Indian Muslims in the politics of the country
 mohammad ali jinnah ne lig kaa punargathan kiya or 'qide aazam' ke rup main vikhyath hue
 In 1940 AD, he demanded the partition of India on religious grounds and the merger of Muslim majority provinces to form Pakistan

 Had the historic Lucknow pact of hindu-muslim unity been accepted in the constitution, then perhaps there would have been neither partition of the country nor any wrong picture of Jinnah

 In the Ekling Mahatmya composed during the time of Maharana Kumbha, the time of Bapa is given in the year 810 AD based on an ancient treatise or commendation
 ek duusare ekling mahatmaya se siddh he ki yah bapa ke rajyatyag kaa samay tha

 shrinkhalaa main naveenatam superkamputer param ishan hai
 Param means "supreme" in Sanskrit
 praudyogiki pratibandh ke parinamswaroop cre super computer se vanchit kiye jane ke baad, bharat ne swadeshi super computer or superkamputing praudyogikiyon ke vikaas ke liye ek kaarykram shuru kiya
 Supercomputers were believed to be capable of assisting with the development of nuclear weapons
 is kshetra main aatmanirbharta praapt karne ke uddeshy se 1988 main centre for deveopment of advanced computing kii sthapana kii gai
 Then Dr
 Vijay Bhatkar of Electronics Department was appointed as its director
 pariyojna 3 saal ke praarambhik ran or ₹30 karod praarambhik dhan ke saath shuru hui
 Some money was spent to purchase supercomputers from America
 1990 main, ek prototip kaa utpaadan kiya gaya or iskaa 1990 ke jurikh superkamputing sho main benchmark kiya gaya tha
 This superseded most other systems
 jisase america ke baad bharat ko duusare number par rakhaa gaya
 These efforts resulted in the ultimate 8000 existence
 jo 1991 main sthapit kiya gaya tha
 The Paramos 8000, released in 1991, used the Inmos T800 transporter
 transputer main samanaantar prasanskaran ke liye ek nae or abhinav microprocesar ko dizine kiya gaya tha
 It was an architecture with a distributed memory MIMD with a variable configuration, interconnection network
 isame germany, britain or rus ko niryaat 64 sipiu the
 The Param 8600 was an improvement over the Param 8000
 yah ek 256 sipiu kaa computer tha
 For every four Inmos T800, it had an Intel i860 co-processor
 iskaa parinaam vector processing main peak 5 GFLOPS niklaa
 Many of these models were exported
 param 9900 / es es ko ek empipi pranali hone ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha
 supersparc 2 processor was used in this
 dizin ko modular karne ke liye badla gaya taaki nae procesar aasaani se shaamil kiye ja saken
 Typically, it used 32–40 processors but, using the Clos network topology, it could be extended to 200 cpus
 param 9900 / yu es, ultrasparc sanskaran tha or param 9900 / ee ek diisi alpha sanskaran tha
 In 1998, the ultimate 1 xxrep 4 0 was unveiled
 param 1 xxrep 4 0 kai swatantra nodes kaa prayog karata tha, prayek san enterprize 250 sarwar par aadhaarit the or prayek sarwar main do 400 mhz ultrasparc 2 procesar lage the
 The base configuration had three compute nodes and a server node
 is aadhaar pranali kii adhiktam gati 6
4 GFLOPS thi
 a typical system would have included 160 cpus and could be capable of up to 100 GFLOPS but, it was easily scalable to the TFLOP series
 rus or singapore ko iskaa niryaat kiya gaya
 The Param Padma was introduced in April 2003
 yah 1024 GFLOPS kii peak speed or 1 tibi kii peak storage se yukt tha
 It used 248 IBM Power4 cpus of 1 ghz
 oparating system ibiem AIX 5
1L tha
 It used paramnet 2 as its primary interconnect
 yah pehla bhartiya super computer tha jisane 1 TFLOP kii seemaa ko paar kiya tha
 Param Yuva was introduced in November 2008
 isaki adhiktam sasteneble speed 38

 It is calculated under visuals

 There is a lack of cash flow
 iskaa nayak dhiroddhat prakruti kaa koi prakhyat vyakti hota he yaa phir koi rajarshi athwa devpurush
 It consists of any juice other than makeup, humor and cool juices
 dootvaakya main ‘vyayog’ ke mukhya lakshan ghatit hote hue dekhe ja sakate hai
 Its plot is taken from that part of the story of Mahabharata in which Lord Shri Krishna becomes the messenger of the Pandavas and goes to the Kaurava assembly
 is roopak main streepatro kaa sarvatha abhaav he
 There is talk of war on the division of the state
 kauravon main se dhiroddhat prakruti kaa duryodhana dootvaakya kaa nayak he
 In this, the predominance of Veer Rasa is not of makeup and of shanti juices
 is roopak main keval ek ank he
 The Sanskrit metaphor mainly has three elements - Kathavastu, Neta and Ras
 pracheen kaal se hi sanskrit naatak manch par khele jate rahe hai, isliye inke moolyankan main abhinay kii drushti se manchan -yogyata ko bhi paryaapt mahatva diya jaataa he
 The plot is the main element of the metaphor
 yah prakhyat, utpaada yaa mishra kisi bhi prakaar kii ho sakati he
 There is often a famous chronicle in the metaphor called Vyayoga
 mahakavi bhaas ne dootvaakya kii kathavstu mahabharat ke udyog parv se lee he
 The basic story of Mahabharata is as follows- dyutakrida main haarane ke baad pandav baarah varsh tak vanvaas main or ek varsh tak agyatavaas main vyateet karne kii shart puri karke waapas laute
 When he asked for his share of the kingdom from the Kauravas, Duryodhana declined
 kauravon or pandavon ke bich samjhaute ke praytn prarambh hue
 When this work was not done easily, Yudhishthira requested Sri Krishna to be his messenger for the purpose of making an alliance with the Kauravas in place of the destructive pure
 doot ke rup main unke hastinapur pahunchane par dhritaraashta ne unke swaagat kaa puraa prabandh kiya
 Sri Krishna went first to Kunti, then to Duryadhan etc
 ve vidura ke ghar tehre, jahaan unhone suna ki kaurav yuddh kii puri taiyaari kar chuke hai or ve log shrikrishna kii koi baat maanane ko taiyaar nahin hai; atah shrikrishna kaa dautya karm vyarth ko jayega
 Nevertheless he attended the Rajya Sabha with Vidur on the second day
 jab sab sabhasad yathasthaan baith gayi tab unhone dhritaraashta ko bataaya ki ve pandavon kii ore se kauravon se shaanti-vaarta karne aaye hai
 Sri Krishna proposed to give scope to the Pandavas in front of Duryodhana
 kaurav-pramukh bhishma, dron, vidura or dhritaraashta ne bhi duryodhana se pandavon ko daay bhaag de dene ko kaha, kintu durvinith duryodhana pandavon ko sui kii nonk ke baraabar kii bhoomi dene ko taiyaar nahin tha
 He rejected the proposal of the treaty and asked him to leave the decision on the war itself
 vah cruddh hokar gandhari kii baat ansuni karke apane bhaiyon ke saath rajsabha se chalaa gaya
 Somehow on the request of Vidur, he again came to the Rajya Sabha
 punah usne shakuni, karn, duhshasan aadi se shrikrishna ko bandi banane ko kaha
 Somehow Dhritarashtra stopped him from this blasphemous act
 tab shrikrishna ne apana virat rup darshaya, jise shrikrishna kii krupa se andhe dhritaraashta, dron, bhishma, vidura or sanjay ne dekha
 Dhritarashtra apologized by placing his head at the feet of Shri Krishna
 pandavon ke paas waapas lautakar shrikrishna ne apni sandhivaarta kii asafalataa kaa varnan kiya
 In 'dootavakya', the poet has presented the same story of Mahabharata in a different way - the narrator who entered after Nandipatha was going to tell something as soon as he heard some words from the background
 usase gyaat hota he ki kauravon or pandavon main virodh ho gaya he or usee ke liye duryodhana kii ajna se uskaa sevak mantrashala kii vyavastha kar rahaa he
 Duryodhana appears on the stage as a heroic king
 vah sab aamantirat raajaaon or sabhaasadon ko sammaan ke saath sabhabhavan main baithaata he
 On the suggestion of Shakuni among all the councilors, Bhishma Senapati is elected
 isi samay kanchukeey baadaraayan pandavon ke shivi se doot ke rup main purushottam narayan ke aane kii soochna detaa he
 Duryodhana gets angry when he calls Shri Krishna as Narayan and asks Kanchukiya to say that a messenger named Keshav has come
 baad main vah upasthit raajaaon se poochta he ki krishna ke saath hamaara vyavhaar kaisaa hona chahie
 On hearing his respectful reply, he gets excited again and says that he is interested in capturing Krishna
 vah ajna detaa he ki keshav ke aane par koi bhi sammanarth apane asana se nahin uthegaa
 If anyone does this, he will be punished hard by the state
 swayan apane ko uthne se rokane ke liye vah baadaraayan se draupadi ke keshaharan kaa chitrapat mangavata he jise dekhtaa hua vah baitha rah sake
 Looking at the picture, he portrays the gestures of Draupadi, Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, nakula-sahadeva, Shakuni, Acharya etc
 duryodhana ke kehane par kanchukeey doot krishna ko lene jaataa he
 Duryadhan asks Karna to be ready to listen to Krishna's soft words like women
 shrikrishna ke sabha main pravesh karte hi sabhi raja or kshatriya ghabadaa kar khadey ho jate hai
 Duryodhana also falls from his posture
 vasudev krishna sabhi raajaaon ko sammaan ke saath asana grahan karne kaa anurodh karte hai
 Seeing Draupadi's hairstyle and clothes drawing near Duryodhana, he heartily praises him that Duryadhan considers his valor due to foolishness to insult his captives
 aupchaarik kushalvarta ke anantar vasudev pandavon kaa sandesh sunaate hai ki ‘jo hamaara daybhag he, vah hamen milanaa chahie
 'duryodhana says that' Pandu got the Munishap, so the Pandavas are Devaputra, then how are our brothers? What right in his father's wealth? ' Vasudeva asks Duryodhana how Dhritarashtra can also inherit the wealth of his father Vichitravirya? Duryodhana Vasudev is also rebuked for his childish acts
 shrikrishna kii tarksangat spashtvaadita se duryodhana or baukhala jaataa he
 He states that the kingdom is not an object to be received in alms
 vah rajya kaa trinmaatr bhi pandavon ko nahin degaa
 Vasudev warns him that due to you the entire Kuru dynasty will be destroyed soon
 ve jane lagate hai
 Duryodhana orders them to be arrested
 vasudev vishwaroop main prakat ho jate hai
 Duryoghan becomes more confused by his illusion and walks out
 vasudev krodhit hokar sudarshan chakra ko bulaate hai, vah maanav rup main prakat hota he
 Vasudeva is composed by Sudarshan's explanation
 anantar vasudev ke divyastra sharrg dhanush, coumodaki gada, paanchajnya shankh or nandak asi ek ke baad ek pravesh karte hai or sudarshan ke samajhane par laut jate hai
 Then Vishnuvahana Garuda enters
 bhagavan ko shaantarosh jaanakar sabhi apane-apane dham laut jate hai
 Later, Sri Krishna also starts returning to the Pandavas' camp, that is when the old Dhritarashtra enters
 dhritaraashta vasudev ke pairon par girakar putron ke aparaadh ke liye kshamaa maangate hai
 The Envoy metaphor ends with Bharatavakya
 mahabharat kii mul katha se dootvaakya kii katha kii tulana karne par hamen mahakavi bhaas dwaara kiye gayi kuch moulik parivartan dikhaayi dete hai
 In the Mahabharata, Dhritarashtra is the king, he sits on the throne when Krishna comes as the messenger, while Duryodhana is depicted as the king in the envoy
 dootvaakya main draupadi ke kesh or vastra khinchne se sambandhit chitra kavi kii udbhaavna he
 In the Mahabharata, no special attempt is made to imprison Shri Krishna, while the attempt to bind him is shown in the envoy
 dootvaakya main divya ayudhon or vaahan garud kii maanav rup main avatarana kavi kii apni kalpana he
 The poet has made the lengthy conversation between Sri Krishna and Duryodhana very satirical and interesting
 in sab naveentaaon se hi dootvaakya kii katha or samvaad sundar or prabhaavshaalee ho gayi hai
 The name of this metaphor, 'dootavakya', is completely meaningful because it is based on Sri Krishna's sentence, ie, Sandhi - offer

 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin

 Shakti Muni, the eldest son of sage Vashistha was coming from the other side on the same route
 rajkumaar kalmampaad ne shakti muni ko pehle pul paar karne ke liye rasta nahin diya
 Both were adamantly adamant
 bahut der hone par shakti muni ne naaraaz hokar kalmampaad ko shraap dekar kaha, 'are nikrushth! tu rakshas ho ja

 yahan dhara baayen kinare se lagakar bahati he or yah karaara varuna sangam ke kuch aage tak chalaa jaataa he
 At Tantepur, this stream starts moving towards the other shore and the shore starts to be low and sandy
 kathi ke paas ganga pun: uttar kii ore mudhati he or uskaa yah mukh balua tak bana rahata he
 From Kathy to Kanwar, the southern edge is full but later turns into a narrow gorge, but a fertile strip of soil from Kanwar to Balu is penetrated within
 is ghumaav ke andar jaloopur pargana he
 a sub-section of the Ganges joins the Ganges above some of the sandstone from within this pargana
 balua se ganga uttar-pashchim kii ore gum jaati he
 Its left side is low and sandy till the border of Jalahapur and Katehar
 yahan se nadi pehle uttar kii ore baad main uttar-purv kii ore bahati he
 The southeast edge of Katehar starts and there are pieces of Khadar here and there
 doosraa kinaaraa pargana baraa main aata he
 Some distance from the northern end of Barah, the Ganges separates Ghazipur and Varanasi and enters Ghazipur district
 nadi kinare kii bhugarbhik banaavat or bahut jagahon par conkarile karaaron ke kaaran jile main nadi kii dhara main bahut kam adal-badal hua he
 It is said that there was no other stream of Ganga except the Barh branch in ancient times
 lekin is baat kaa pramaan he ki ganga kii dhara pracheen kaal main duusari hi tarah se bahati thi
 From the Chaithas near Kaith in Pargana Katehar, it seems that due to these narrow agreements the river used to turn south at one time
 ganga kii is pracheen dhara ke bahaav kaa gyaan banganga se hota he jo barsaat main bhar jaati he
 Starting from Tanda, Banganga moves south towards Mahuwari for six miles, then eastwards to Rasulpur, finally crossing Ramgarh in the north to Hasanpur
 jis samay ganga kii dhar kaa yah rukh tha us samay ganga kii vartmaan dhara main gomti bahati thi jo ganga main saiyadpur ke paas mil jaati thi
 It is popular that Shantanu took Banganga out of the earth on the occasion of the swayamvara of Kashiraj's daughter
 kashiraj kii rajdhani us samay ramgarh thi
 If at any time Rajprasad was in Ramgarh, he must have stayed on the Ganges and thus on the basis of this folk tale, it can be said that Ganga once flowed through Ramgarh
 ganga kii is pracheen dhara ke bare main pracheen sahitya main bhi anek pramaan hai
 There is no discussion of this stream of Ganga in Brahmin and Buddhist literature, but it is mentioned a little in Jain literature
 jainon ne ek pracheen ang nayadhamm kaha main is baat kaa ullekh he ki varanasi ke uttar-purv main mayganga tirthadah arthath mritganga tirthahrid tha
 According to Uttarayadhana Churni, there was a heart in the lower flow of the Mayaganga which collected a lot of water which never came out
 jinprabhasuri ne vividh tirthakalp main maatang rishi bal kaa janm sthaan mritganga kaa kinaaraa batalaaya he
 It is said in the legend that the sage force once stayed in a park called Tinduk
 vahaan unhone apane gunon se gandi tinduk yaksha ko prasann kar liya
 The girl from Kosal Raj spit on him once upon seeing the sage
 is par yaksha uske sir par chadh gaya or raaj kanya ko rishi se vivaah karnaa padaa
 Rishi later abandoned her and she married Rudradeva
 bhiksha-yachana par nikle rishi kaa ek samay brahman apmaan kar rahe the lekin bhadraa ne unhen pahachaanaa or brahmanon kii bhartsna kii
 The sage again forgave the Brahmins as well
 mritganga sambandhi ukt katha se kai baaten gyaat hoti he, pehali yah ki kam-se-kam guptyuga main jab nayadhamm kaha-likhi gayi mritganga aaj ke jaisi hi thi
 The second is that this dead Ganga was to the north-east of Varanasi which is quite right from the geographical point of view
 teesri yah ki aaj se 1300 varsh pehle isamen pani bharaa rahata tha or yah dah ban jaati thi
 Now the water comes only in the rain in the Mritanga
 sambhavat: 1000 varsh pehle banganga adhik gahari thi or baad main mitti bharne se chhichhli ho jane ke kaaran pani rokane main asamarth ho gayi
 Ramgarh has the status of ancient ruins of Vairant on the banks of Banganga, which is important
 lok kathaon ke anusaar yahan ek samay pracheen varanasi basii thi
 The first to investigate the ruins of the baraunt is A
C
L
 Carlyle did it
 vairant kii sthiti ganga ke dakshin main saidpur se dakshin-purv main or varanasi ke uttar-purv main kareeb 16 mile or gajipur ke dakshin-pashchim kareeb 12 mile he
 The ruins of Vairant are on the circular south-eastern edge of Banganga
 bairant ke naam vyutpatti ke bare main thik-thik nahin kaha ja saktaa
 The capital of fisheries Bairant which is in Jaipur, Rajasthan is different from this, yet the mention of fisheries in this region has come in one place in Mahabharata
 lagata he matsay ek jagah sthir na hokar aage-peeche aate-jate rahe hogen or shaayad is naam se unka sambandh bhi ho
 But in cosmic discipline there is a part of the truth and it cannot be avoided as a rumor
 bairant ke khandhiron main pracheen kile kaa bhagnavshesh banganga ke purvi kone par he
 The ruins of the ancient city lie on the ground far from the fort to the south, after which they turn around and are located on the bank of the river towards the south-west
 purana kila mitti kaa bana he par usamen bahut si inten bhi milti he
 Its length is about 410 meters in the north-south and about 275 meters in the east
 iske bagal main praakaar ke 20 se 30 meter chaude vapra ke avshesh hai
 At some places it is Vpr but it is cut from drains
 kile ke teen ore arthath uttar-purv, uttar-pashchim or dakshin-purv ke attalak batch gaye hai
 The four gates of the fort, especially the north-south gates, are still unearthed
 kile ke andar dakshin main kareeb ek tihaai bhaag nicha he, phir ek tihaai jameen uttar kii ore chadhati hui he or kile kii uttari chauthaa bhaag or bhi he
 north-east Attalak has ruins of a large building
 kile ke baahar kii khai ke nishaan ab bhi uttar-dakshin kii ore dikhte hai
 There is a village called Vairant about 120 meters from the fort
 is gaanv ke uttar-purv main 50 meter kii dur par ek doosraa tila he
 There is a lake of Bhagatin at about 620 meters north of the village, with another mound about 100 meters to the north
 talab se kareeb 200 meter pashchim main ramsala naam kaa mandir he, jahaan aghori mahant or unke chele rahete hai
 Ramgarh is a village about 1 km north of this temple
 bairant gaanv ke uttar-purv 210 meter par thikaron or eenton se pati kuch jameen he
 About 140 meters to the south of the fort there are ruins of nature, which are visible from east to west for about 425 meters
 iske paas main hi chauras tila he jiske dakshin main ek naala he
 There is a village and a mound in Rasulpur, about 900 meters from this drain
 is tarah dekhne se pataa chalata he ki banganga ke purvi kinare par puraane kile se rasulpur tak koi pracheen shahar basaa tha kyonki varsha kaal main baraabar yahan se dhikre or inten nikalati rahati he
 Not only this, the ruins of the ancient city have gone about 700-800 meters further south-west from Rasulpur
 shahar ke is badhaav ke dakshini kone par banganga par purana ghat he
 Where the ruins of the city end there is a turret of mud
 karlile ke anusaar pracheen kile ko chhodkar shahar kii puri lambaai kareeb 3 yaa 3-5 kimi he
 The width of the city from east to west is not known precisely because the land has been leveled for fields
 lekin dhyaan se dekhne par shahar kii uttari or chaudaai lagbhag 600 meter or dakshin 400 meter se 300 meter or theth dakshini ore 240 meter rah jaati he
 Typical east of the ancient city was the floor of an ancient shallow river that surrounded the city
 ab suukh gaya he par isamen barsaat main thodaa pani bhar jaataa he
 Carlile found several battered and minted coins from Barant
 isa purv duusari sadi kii brahmi lipi main jyeshthadutt tathaa vijayamitra ke sikke tathaa kanishka ke bhi sikke unhen mili
 Ram Krishnadas and Dr
 Moti Chand also collected very hurt coins from the baraunt
 ek sikke par shungakaalin brahmi main "gomi' lekh he
 Carlyle has also got a lot of Akiq etc
 from here
 bharatkala bhawan kaashi hindu vishvavidhyalay main bhi aisi maniyon kaa acha sangrah he
 Pieces of elephant tooth bangles are also found here in large numbers
 karlile ko bairant ke aas-paas ke naalon or kheton se prastar yug kii chippiyaan tathaa kor bhi mili the in sab baton se yah siddh ho jaataa he ki bairant kii basti pracheen he
 With the founding of pieces of black pottery, it becomes certain that there was settlement in the Mauryan era
 upar hamane vairant ke pracheen shahar kaa isliye vistaarpurvak varnan kiya ki is nagar kii sthiti se varanasi ke pracheen itihaas par prakaash padataa he
 It is necessary to know some things regarding the ancient condition of Kashi at this place
 mahabharat main yah katha aayi he ki kashiraj harya ko vitishvyo ne ganga-yamuna ke maidan main haraakar maar daalaa
 Haraya's son Sudev also had to beat the battle
 baad main unke putr divodas ne duusari varanasi ganga ke uttar kinare or gomti ke dakshin kinare par basaai
 Now the question arises that where was this second Varanasi settled by Divodas? Looking at the modern stream of the Ganges, this city should be near Kathy, the confluence of ganges-gomti, but there is no ruin of any ancient city around Kathy
 chandravati ke bhi gahadwaal yug ke pehle ke nahin he or ek bade shahar kaa to yahan naam nishaan bhi nahin miltaa
 Till date it is not even heard that any ancient coins have been found from Chandravati
 aasapaas khojane par bairant ke sivaa koi aisi duusari jagah nahin milti jahaan pracheen kaal main ek shahar rahaa he
 The current stream of ganga-gomti falls against this view, but if the ancient stream of Ganga is imagined, then it seems possible to have a second Varanasi made of Divodas on the baryant itself
 banganga rasurpur tak purvavahini hokar hasanpur main ganga ke vartmaan pravaah main mil jaati he
 At the time when the original flow of Ganga was from Banganga Kanthe, at this time Gomti used to come from Ganga near Saidpur flowing in the current stream of Ganga
 is tarah bairant yaa pracheen varanasi gomti ke dakshin main padataa tha jaisaa ki mahabharat main kaha gaya he
 Now the question is, how long did this new Varanasi last? It seems that the city remained in the baraunt until the Ganges had not changed its flow
 par jab ganga ne is jagah ko chhod diya tab nagar bhi dhire-dhire viraan ho chalaa or ant main keval tila rah gaya
 But when did all this happen? It is known that the city of Varant was inhabited by the Mauryugas and that the Ganges may have changed its course only after the third century BCE
 kam-se-kam jaisaa hamen anushrutiyon se pataa lagata he guptyuga main to mritganga arthath banganga itihaas main aa chuki thi, at: ganga ne apana rasta iske kai shatabdi pehle badla hoga
 This question is of great importance from a historical point of view, but more light can be thrown on this question only when the modern excavation of the warrant is done
 subahaa or assi jaise do ek maamuli naale-naaliyon ko chhodkar is jile main ganga kii mukhya sahaayak nadiyaan barna or gomti hai
 Barna has a lot of importance for the history of Varanasi because Varanasi city was named after this river as we have proved earlier
 atharvaveda main shaayad barna ko hi baranavati naam se sambodhan kiya gaya he
 In that era people believed that the water of this river has the supernatural quality of removing snake-venom
 pracheen puranic yug main is nadi kaa naam "varnasi' tha
 The Barna enters the western side of the border of Varanasi district by removing it from the pool of Phulpur on the border of Allahabad and Mirzapur districts and here its confluence takes place in the village Saravan from the Visuhi river
 visuhi naam kaa sambandh shaayad vishdhni se ho
 Probably the ancient belief of the power of poisoning in the waters of Barna river is indicated by the name of one of its tributaries
 bisuhi or uske baad varanaa kuch dur tak jonpur or varanasi kii seemaa banaati he
 Eating forcefully, the Barna River goes east and sets the boundaries of Panditha Athaganwa and Shivpur in the north towards the south and Kaswar and Dehat Amanat
 banaras chhavnee ke uttar se hoti hui nadi dakshin-purv kii ore gum jaati he or sarai mohana par ganga se iskaa sangam ho jaataa he
 It has two shrines above Varanasi, Rameshwar and Kalkabada
 nadi ke donon kinare shuru se aakhir tak saadhaarant: hai or anginat naalon se kate hai
 This river is also mentioned in the Puranas
 puranic yug main yah vishwaas tha ki varanasi kshetra kii seemaa gomti se barna tak thi
 Before reaching this district, Gomti's party is increased by meeting Say
 nadi jile ke uttar main sultanipur se ghusati he or vahaan se 22 mile tak arthath kathi main ganga se sangam hone tak yah jile kii uttari sarhad banaati he
 The river flow is zigzag and its banks are sometimes sloping
 nand gomti kii ekmaatr sahaayak nadi he
 The river originates from the north-east of Phulpur at Kol Asla on the border of Jaunpur and joins Gomti at Dhaurahara
 nand main hathi naam kii ek choti nadi hariharpur ke paas milti he
 In the medieval period, the Hindus believed that the touch of water in Karamnasa destroys virtue
 karamnasa or uski sahaayak nadiyaan chandauli jile main he
 The river originates from the Kaibhur hills and runs through Mirzapur district, first from Majhwar Pargana in Banaras district to the village of Fatehpur
 majhavaar ke dakshin-poorabi hisse main kareeb 10 mile chalakar karamnasa gajipur kii sarhad banaati hui pargana narvam ko jila shahabaad se alag karti he
 Leaving the district at Kakrait, she joins the Ganges at Chausa, 34 miles from Fatehpur
 naubatpur main is nadi par pul he or yaheen se grand trunk road or gaya ko railway line jaati he
 The main tributary of Karamnasa is the Gadai which rises from the hills of Mirzapur and enters this district near Shivnathpur in the south of Parganas Dhus and forms the border of Majhwar and Dhus to some extent and later it joins Karamnasa towards east
 is
 majhavaar main gurari ke paas mirzapur ke pahari ilaake se nikalakar chandraprabha banaras jile ko baburi par chooti hui thodi dur mirzapur main bahakar uttar main karamnasa se mil jaati he
 From the above description of the rivers of Banaras district, it is known that Banaras has migratory rivers but not in Chandauli, due to which there are lakes and marshes in that district, due to excess rain, the villages are filled with water and the crop is damaged

 Ghagh believed that agriculture is the best occupation, in which the farmer plots the land himself: athwa- Ghagh's views regarding manures were very strong
 unhone gobar, kooda, haddi, nil, sanai, aadi kii khaadon ko krishi main prayukt kiye jane ke liye vaisaa hi saraahneey prayaas kiya jaisaa ki 1840 i
