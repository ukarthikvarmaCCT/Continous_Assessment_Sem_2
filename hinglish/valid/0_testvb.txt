 khuli arthvyavastha arthvyavastha kaa ek darshan he
 If we understand the open economy by its literal meaning, then it means a country or society where anyone is allowed to do business with anyone and not that there is no government control or control over this trade
 par sarkaar aisi nitiyaan banaati he jisase aam log udyog or anya prakaar ke vyapaar aasaani se shuru kar saken
 In such an economy, businesses are allowed to flourish independently
 sarkari niyantran aise banaaye jaate he jinamein vyapaaron ko kisi bhi prakaar kii beyimaani se to roka jaataa he par niyantran ko itnaa bhi kadaa nahi kiya jaataa he ki imaandar vyapaar me asuvidha ho
 Open economy is not only for the internal trade of that society or country, but also external trade is seen from the same point of view
 khuli arthvyavastha kaa vichaar bharat me koi nayaa nahi he
 On reading the history carefully, it is known that India had a policy of open economy for trade from the beginning
 chandragupta maury ke samay me bharat me china se or europe se vyapaar ke bare main pataa chalata he
 The silk route is an example of India's contribution to international trade
 chanrdragupta maury or samraat ashok ke samay me kasht kaa vyapaar hota tha
 Trade flourished in India at the time of Akbar
 angrez bhi bharat me vyapaar karne aaye the
 That means in 1700-1800, there was trade in India with traders of foreign origin
 sambhavtah east india company ke vyapaariyon se saashak banane se bhartiya samaaj main vyapaar ko le ke ek aisi dharna ban gayi ki baad me 1947 me bharat ke azaad hone pe bharat me khuli arthvyavastha kaa saport zyaada netaaon ne nahi kiya
 India's first Prime Minister Pt
 Nehru was strongly influenced by Russian socialism
 azaadi ke baad nehru ke bharat me samaajwaad kii sthapana karne kaa praytn kiya
 Perhaps this was the biggest mistake in the field of India's economy
 1947 se 1990 tak bharat me khuli arthvyavastha nahi thi
 India imposed various taxes on imports and exports
 niryaat pe hone vale karon kii vajah se bhartiya udyog yaha banaaya hua maal antar-rashtreey bazaar me sasta nahi bench pate the
 India lagged behind the failure of Indian industries to compete in the international market
 is dauraan japan, china, korea, taiwan jaise desho ne antar-rashtreey bazaar me apana dabdaba banaaya
 Imports in India were also heavily taxed
 is kaaran se videshi udyog bharat me apana saamaan bechney me dikkat kahsus karte the
 Due to being very expensive in India similar to those made abroad, more people could not buy in India
 jo taknic bharat ke baahar janm leti thi ve aasaani se bharat ke logon tak nahi pahunch paati thim
 On the one hand, the citizens of India were deprived of computers, modern clocks, modern telephones, cars, etc
 from 1947 to 1980's, on the other hand, Indian industries could not get the necessary technology
 antar-rashtreey tareeko or takneekon se apane utpaada na bana paane kii vajah se bharat ke kayi udyog jaise textyle, krishi, aviation, manyufaccharing, ityadi antar-rashtreey maanakon se peeche rah gayi
 India's growth rate was around 3
0% and it came to be known by the Hindu growth rate in the world
 bharat ke udyogon ke viksit naa ho paane kii vajah se bharat ke tamaam log garibi rekha se neeche rah gayi
 During this time, the basic infrastructure of India developed very slowly
 bharat kaa bijli, pani, sadke, soochna tantra ityaadi kaphi kharaab hota chalaa gaya
 Inflation went up due to very high inflation, but due to the sick condition of the industries, the income of the people could not increase at the rate of inflation
 bharat me san 1985 se belans ouf pement kii samsya shuru hui
 The balance of payment problem in India took a formidable situation during the rule of Chandrashekhar government in 1991 and India's already lean economy was hit

 vartmaan yug main kaaron, trakon, motorcykilon va vayuyanon aadi main prayog hone vaale anterdahan ingine praayah four stroke ingine hote hai
 'four stroke' means that the cycle of conversion from fuel to mechanical energy is completed in a total of four steps
 in charnon yaa strokeon ko kramash: intech, sampeden, jvalan, evam utsarjan kehete hai
 It is worth noting that the crankshaft has to take two rounds to complete these four steps
 vartmaan main gadiyon main saamanyat: four stroke ingine kaa prayog zyada hota he
 Earlier, two stroke engines were used in vehicles, but due to low mileage and short life span, it was replaced by four stroke engine
 four-stroke ingine ko sarvapratham uzenio barsanti evam phelis matuasi ne 1854 main patent karaayaa tha
 After this, in 1860, its first prototype was brought out
 french ejeeniyar alphonse beau de roka ne bhi swatantra rup se siddhant anveshit kiya tha or use apane shodhpatr main 1861 main nikaala tha
 In 1876, the German engineer Nicholas Auto produced a working model of this engine
 is kaaran hi aaj four-stroke siddhant ko auto-cycle or is ingine main prayog hone vaale spark plegon ko praayah auto ingine kaha jaataa he
 The auto-cycle consists of adiabatic compression, heat compaction at constant volume, adiabatic expansion and heat rejection phase at constant volume
 four stroke ingine ek puri cycle yani ek baar main chaar chaar prakriyaaon se gujarata he
 Which are called strokes in English
 prayek ingine main ek khokhla belan hota he, jise silinder kehete hai
 a piston moves inside the cylinder, which we can call musli
 is piston kaa kaam thik vahiin hota he jo bacchon kii rang khilne kii pichakaari ke bheetar chalanevaali daat kaa
 The piston is made of aluminum or steel and consists of spring steel bangles, so that air or gas cannot pass from one side of the piston to the other
 silinder kaa maathaa band rahata he, parantu isamen do valve rahete hai
 Air, or a mixture of air and petrol, can enter when one is opened

 uchit samayon par in donon taron ke bich bijli kii chinagaari nikalati he, jiskaa niyantran ingine ke chalate rahane par apane-aap hota rahata he
 The function of the crank is to change the speed of the piston moving back and forth to the axis of the axis
 crank ke kaaran piston ke aage peeche chalane par ingine kii dhuree gumti he
 Repeated burning of fuel causes the piston not to become very hot, because of this the walls of the cylinder are there and the water flows through the pump between them
 motorcar aadi main ek ke badale chaar, chah yaa aath silinder rahete hai or lohe kii jis ishtika main ye bane rahete hai use block kehete hai
 The valves mentioned above keep the passage of air, etc
 sticking due to segregation, but the valve is lifted at the appropriate time by the cam, which opens the passage of air or gas
 cam jis dhuree par jade rahete hai usko cam-dhuree kehete hai
 This spindle is driven by the engine itself and keeps the valves open at the appropriate times

 That is why there is a provision to deliver lubricant oil everywhere
 motorkaron main ingine kaa nichalaa hissaa bahudhaa thaal ke rup main hota he jisamen tel daal diya jaataa he
 In each round, the crank is immersed in oil and by splattering it also infuses the cylinder with oil
 anya sthanon main tel pahunchaane ke liye pump laga rahata he
 In engines operating according to the quadrant cycle, the piston runs four times, completing one cycle of its program
 ye chaar nimnlikhit hai: Now the piston sucks air and petrol from the blow of the flyheel, compresses it, burns fuel to generate power and burns out gases
 yahi kram tab tak chaalu rahata he jab tak switch band karke chinagaarion ko band nahin kar diya jaataa
 To turn an engine, it has to be rotated with a handle on its main axis, or with a battery-powered electromotor
 ek baar flihil main shakti aa jane par ingine chalane lagata he
 In diesel engines, the suction power piston draws only air, not fuel; At the start of the power ambush, the fuel is released into the cylinder by force, with the help of a pump, and it burns without any spark, due to the heat of the compressed air
 chaar stroke engine ke kai laabh hote hai
 This increases the power efficiency of the engine
 isse gaadi kii dakshata main sudhaar hota he
 The engine produces less heat than two-stroke
 urja kaa puraa upyog hone se ingine kii aayu badhati he or vah dhuna kam phenkata he
 Thus, the efficiency of the engine as well as emissions is also relatively low
 tu-stroke ingine main crack-shaft ke ek chakkar main hi urja ke dono chakra puure kar liye jate hai jabaki four-stroke ingine main crank-shaft ke do chakkaron main urja ke chaaro chakra puure ho pate hai
 This causes the turbulence in the quadrant engine to rise
 chaar ghaati injanon main ghoomane vaale hisson kii taralata ke liye va unhen ragad or gharshan se bachaane ke liye alag se lubrication oil pahunchaaya jaataa he 
 When there is combustion in petrol without Lubricant oil, the waste gases that form in the gas, the vapor present in it passes through the silencer and spoils it
 sailencer kii yah sthiti un vaahanon main dekhne main nahin aati, jinamein inrdhan ke saath oil mila hota he
 In addition, multi-engine locomotives have more parts, which makes them more expensive to repair

 This is because the addition of electrons that take place in the same deputy shell and are subjected to an increased pull of atomic charge in each phase
 neeche ek samooh chal rahaa he, tatwon ke parmaanu trigya parmaanu ke rup main bad jaati haisankhya bad jaati he
 As one of us moves, this is due to the increase in the number of shells down to the next group element
 he parmaanu shulk main vruddhi se adhik atirikt khol se muaavja This is the amount of energy needed to extract the electrons most loosely, the outermost shell of a neutral gaseous atom

pi-block tatwon kii pehali ynsinkranizeshan enthalapi aam taur par bad jaati he par jane sebayein se daayen ek avadhi ke saath
 This is because as we move from right to left with a period, the size of the equation decreases
 ek chota sa atom main electron kasakar yojit kii jaati hai
 The larger the atom, the less strongly the electrons are held by the nucleus
 ynsinkranizeshan enthalapi, isliye,parmaanu kaa aakaar main kami ke saath bad jaati he
 However, there are some exceptions, eg, the first ion synchronization enthalpy of a group 16 element is less than a group 15 element
 yah hekhyonki ek samooh 15 tatv ke maamle main, electron aadha bharaa pi kakshiya se nikaala ja saktaa he
 In general there is a regular way, but the first ion synchronization enthalpy decreases in a group descending order
 yah he kyonki ek samooh par utarate, parmaanu kaa aakaar bad jaati he
 As a result the electrons are less tightly held by the nucleus and, therefore, the first ion synchronization enthalpy decreases
 jab ek electron ek tatasth gasiy atom ke liye joda jaataa he, garmi urja yaa to jari kiya gaya he yaa avashoshit
 The amount of heat energy that is released or absorbed when an additional electron is added to a gaseous neutral called atom electron gain enthalpy, ie, the energy change
 For this process: x + e-x typically most atoms For, the electron gain is negative, ie enthalpy, released when an electron is added to a neutral gaseous atom
 lekin kuch parmaanuon ke liye electron laabh enthalapi ek sakaaratmak maatra, arthath he, ke alaava ke dauraan urja avashoshit ho jaati he ek electron
 a period of electron affinity usually becomes more negative, moving from left to right along
 yah he kyonki ek avadhi ke paar chal rahaa he, parmaanu kaa aakaar ghataata he
 As a result, the force of attraction exerted by the electron nucleus increases
 falswarupaparmaanu ek electron hasil karne ke liye adhik se adhik kii pravriti he
 Therefore, the electron gain enthalpy becomes more negative
 neeche ek samooh chal rahaa he, electron laabh enthalapi kam nakaaratmak ho jaataa he
 This is due to the increase in the size of the atom and thus, the reduced attraction for electrons; Atom will have less tendency to get one electron
 isliye, electron laabh enthalapi kam nakaaratmak ho jaataa he
 But in the halogen group, the electron gain is more negative than that of enthalpy chlorine
 yah he kyonki f parmaanu kaa aakaar bahut chota he, jo banaata he ke alaava electron electronic pratikarshan inter karne ke liye anukool kaaran kam
 a similar situation exists for the first element of each group

 The second most electronegative oxygen is followed by nitrogen in third place
 tatv dhaatu or gaiyr dhaatu main mote taur par vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa
 Metals are electrosurgical in character, ie, they easily loss of positive ions from electrons, while form non-ionic, they are easily gain by negative ions as the characters are electrified
 pi-block tatwon kii dhaatu or gaiyr dhaatu varna is rup main bhinn hota he:avadhi ke saath dhaatu charitra, jabaki kam ho jaati he gaiyr dhaatu charitra bad jaati he
 During the period, atomic size decreases, because it is increased atomic charge and, therefore, the ionisation energy increases
 neeche samooh le jane dhaatu charitra jabaki bad jaati he, gaiyr-dhatvik charitra,ghat jaati he
 This is because the atomic size increases as a group moves down

 Therefore, the metallurgy increases and the non-metallic character decreases

26389 vidhi saamaajik niyantran kii kriya he
 These controls are the authorized rules of conduct which determine the outline of social life by presenting easy convenience and easy peace
 vidhi manushyakrut he, uski suvidha hetu saadhan maatr he, koi daivi athwa bahya tathy nahin
 As a result, man is not for law, but law is for man - although law controls society, this control is according to the wishes of society
 samaaj kii samuhik ichha saamaajik niyantrikaran main har desh kaal main kisi na kisi rup main sadaa ek maanya shakti rahi he
 Public opinion is an organized force that is a replica of the society's continuously accepted traditional ideals and feelings and also represents the immediate feelings of that society
 janamat pravagic or sthitik do prakaar kaa hota he
 a public opinion is based on traditional stereotypes and ideals and behavior, static public opinion is related to permanent sentiments and their advertisement
 isliye prati din nirantar nayaa rup dhaaran karata rahata he, dharm kii pukaar, anany saahas kaa aakarshan yaa preranaatmak sahitya kaa laalitya desh kaal ke anusaar samay samay par janamat banane main sahaayak yaa saadhan rup rahe hai
 In the twentieth-century Yantrauga, journalism is the main participant in public opinion
 yah akatya satya he ki saamaajik sansthaaon kaa nirmaan samaaj ke vishwaas or anubhutiyon par nirbhar rahaa he
 Law is a social institution, being a system of control for social convenience
 isi kaaran vidhisanchaalak athwa vidhikaar sadaa janamat se bal praapt karte hai
 Public opinion in relation to law means public awareness and vigilance, which can balance the rationale of the law and decide which law is beneficial and able to be made and which law is not public beneficial and hence deserving to be nullified
 is jaagrath avasthaa kaa janamat vidhi kaa aadhaar hona chahie
 But this is not often the case, often the basis of a flawed public opinion method
 aise bhramaatmak janamat kaa kaaran kabhi agyaan or kabhi bhay donon hi hote hai-jaise pracheen kaal main daspratha kii vidhi janamat par avashya nirmit thi kintu yah janamat trutipurna, agyaan or bhay mishrit aadhaar tha
 It is meaningless to call such a opinion in real sense
 sajag jigyasapurna mat hi vaastavik janamat he jo vidhi ke sambandh main kriyaatmak ho saktaa he
 This is often lacking because not every country or society has such logical awareness
 adhiktar manushya chintan dwaara nahin varan rudhigat abhyaason or bhaawanaaon dwaara kaary karte hai
 In such a situation there is no place for intellectual deliberation - instances are also found where legislative construction or change has been completely against the majority of the public
 yah vidhinium ek yaa kuch thode se vyaktiyon kii cheshtaa se nirmit hue
 Somewhere it was possible that the personality of these few individuals or one person was so powerful that it became influential, somewhere the whole society had such a weak level that they succeeded
 bharat main british rajya main bharatiyon ke prati hanikaarak vidhiyon kaa nirmaan hota rahaa, iskaa kaaran desh kii samuhik durbalata thi
 In Turkistan, Kamal Pasha Ataturk conducted the lonely legislation which was against the feelings of the country, the reason for his personal personality
 itnaa avashya he ki adhiktar aise vyaktiyon ko desh kaa janamat na praapt hote hue bhi kaal kaa yaa yug kaa mat praapt hota he
 Only on the basis of this age-old majority, their construction is successful
 abraham linkan ke saath dakshini america ke bhuswami nahin the kintu yug kii vaani thi, jiske bal par daspratha mitaane kii vidhi vah bana sake
 It is known from experience that the opinion of the era or the referendum of the century is more effective, powerful and actionable than the opinion of the country or place
 yah kadaapi sambhav nahin ki desh, kaal donon ke bahumat ke virodh main koi vidhinirman safal ho se
 The parable of the most learned and very unsuccessful Emperor Mohammad Tughlaq in the history of India is a sign of this
 uske sudhaar ati moulik the, kintu desh or kaal donon ke bahumat se pare the isiilie ve asafal hue
 Often the absence of a Legislature with proper representation in the country also creates a lack of public opinion in the law
 aisi sthiti vidrohatmak hoti he
 In both France and the United States, due to the lack of a properly represented legislature, legislatures against public opinion continued, which ended in rebellion and rebellion
 in drushtaanton se siddh he ki anek sthitiyon main, vaastavik arth main, janamat vidhi kaa aadhaar nahin bhi hota
 Apart from this, it is also true that in any society, the active participants in social life are not the whole community, but only a few people
 vidhinirmaan main inhen kaa mat prabhavatmak hota he
 By the way, this active group always has the fear of inactive social units that their efforts should not be so against the beliefs of the great masses that they revolt
 atev saadharantaya jis janamat ke aadhaar par vidhirachana hoti he vah saamaajik shaskaon ke bauddhik chintan or jansadharan ke manobhaavon kaa ek adbhut mishran yaa samjhauta sa hota he
 The form of this agreement certainly depends on the personal power of both classes
 britain kii jansadharan chetana itani sajag thi ki nai tithipatri tak kaa virodh hua or bharat main british rajya main bharatiyon ke viruddh bani kisi vidhi kaa athwa swarajya main bhartiya parampara ke nitant viruddh bani vivaah, sanyukt parivaar or dattak adhikaar sambandhi vidhi kaa bhi virodh nahin hua
 The reason for this is simply the intractable sleepy mood of the Indian public
 yahan pun: in vidhiyon ke mul main desh kaa nahin yug ke janamat kaa bal spasht he
 The second form of the question is also that many causes and motivations have their own importance on one side and the personal selfish motivation of man has its own influence and importance on the other
 vyakti hi vidhikar hote hai or vidhirachana ke samay unka swabhaav manushya kaa hi hota he, vitaragi kaa nahin
 History testifies that since ancient times, the interests and interests of individuals or groups are always inscribed
 vidhikaar apane nijee samooh vishesh kaa hit lakshya rup bana hota he
 The medieval century era belonged to the landlords, the interests of the landlords in the construction of that period are completely safe
 upniveshon or paratantr bhaagon kii vidhi main shwet varg ke swarthrakshak niyam hai
 These groups sometimes belong to the social and sometimes political class, which are subject to legislatures, but it is natural for these communities to have a view of personal selfishness in keeping with the atmosphere of the time and the eloquence of the era
 atev ant main vidhi kaa rup sadaa kisi na kisi prakaar yug, kaal athwa desh ke vaataavaran or matanukool hi nirdhaarit hota he tathaa yah spashtatya siddh he ki vidhi kaa aadhaar janamat hi he

 vah loktantr adhik safal or tikaoo samajha jaataa he jiske abhijanon kaa aakaar badhata rahata he
 On the contrary, in the democracies where the elites make barricades against increasing their size, the system continues to be threatened again and again
 abhijan siddhanth multah is pracheen vishwaas par aadhaarit he ki samaaj mutthi bhar shaskaon or bahusankhyak shasiton main banta hota he
 Plato suggested the identification of people with the requisite nature-mandated abilities to govern
 itihaas or raajnneeti ko samajhane kaa yah ek prachlit tarika he ki un abhijanon kaa adhyayan kiya jaae jinke paas samaaj ke vibhinn kshetron ke sanchaalan ke liye nirnay lene ke adhikaar rahe hai
 In the early twentieth century Italian sociologists Gaetano Mosca and Wilfredo Pareto, as well as German followers of Mosca, Robert Michaels, reacted against the development of democratic systems, claiming that the rule of the elite is a key feature of human history
 yah sutrikaran unnisvin sadi main marxvad dwaara pravartit or pusht samtamulak ke ke kilaaf tha
 These theorists agreed with Marx that the leadership of societies had been in the hands of minorities in the past, but they also said that these minority groups were not necessarily the owners of the means of production
 unke prabhutv kaa strot aarthik nahin tha, balki unki satta vividh sroton se aati thi
 It is another matter that the elite used to accumulate wealth on a large scale by taking advantage of their dominance
 moska or parato kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki bhavishya ke samaajon ke netritv kaa pattern bhi aisa hi rahane vaala he
 Although these scholars insist that their sociology is not tied to any value, their sympathy for the emerging fascism in Italy was not hidden from anyone
 parato or michels to sidhe-sidhe fasiwad ke samarthak the or udaarpanthi moska vampanth se apni naaraazgi ke kaaran fasiwad ko ek majaburi kii tarah dekhte the
 Overall, the effort of these three theorists was that the parliamentary system should be limited only to the participation of the upper and middle class
 ve mazaduron or kisaanon ke pratinidhitiv vaali sansad ko tiraskaarpurn drushti se dekhte the
 Marxist theorists and advocates of democratic pluralism challenged this elitism
 marxvaadiyon ne kaha ki yah siddhant abhijanon ke prabhutv ke buniyadi aadhaar kii shinaakht karne main naakaam rahaa he
 Whether elites are military, religious, political or cultural; The foundation of their dominance must be seen in economic class relations
 bahultavaadiyon kaa tark tha ki aadhunik, viksit or udaarpanthi samaajon main satta or prabhutv ke liye vividh hiton ke bich pratiyogita hoti he
 Therefore, a group of handful members is never able to establish all-round dominance
 nirnay kii prakriya kaa centre sirf ek hi nahin hota
 In contrast to this reality, advocates of elitism adopt a flawed method of studying power and its sources in societies that stand on the basis of liberalism
 haalaanki abhijan siddhant loktantr virdohi tha, par beesvin sadi ke madhya main joseph shumpiter ne loktantric siddhant abhijan main abhijan siddhanth kaa samavesh kiya
 He said that even in democracy, governance should remain in the hands of the elite so that the system gets effective and stable orders
 bas shart yah he ki aise abhijanon kaa chayan loktantric prakriyaaon ke madhyam se kiya gaya ho
 Schumpeter's purpose behind doing this ideological engineering was to protect liberal democracy from movements led by anti-fascist elites who support fascism or communism
 bahultavaadi siddhant ko aade haathon lete hue shumpiter ne kaha ki satta or nirnay kii bahukendriyata kaa udaarataavaadi daawa sahi nahin he
 In fact, the control of the groups competing for dominance remains in the hands of a few leaders who do not necessarily follow the wishes and needs of their group members
 isliye samoohon ke bich kii pratiyogita unke netaaon ke bich kii pratiyogita ban jaati he
 As a result, pluralistic democracy turns into elite democracy
 is vichaar ke loktantr kaa tikaaupan or vikaas niskriy nagar samaaj par nirbhar na ho kar, uske abhijanon kii sakriyata or patibaddhta kaa hi parinaam hota he
 Whether it is a democratic system or autocracy, it is difficult to completely deny the importance of the elite
 kuch vidwaanon kaa tark he ki udaarataavaadi loktantr ke vyakhyaakaar zyaada dhyaan jansamoohon ke prabhaav main liye jane faisalon par dete hai
 In this way, the role of the initiatives taken by the elites is not fully understood
 ilit-study main dilchaspee rakhane vaale samaaj-vaigyanik saamaajik jivan ke vibhinn kshetron ke netaaon kii saamaajik or shaikshik prishthbhumi kii jaanch karke yah pataa lagane kii koshish karte hai ki kin karkon ke prabhaav main unhen abhijan-samooh main shaamil kiya gaya
 If more than one elite group is active in any part of society, it is ascertained what kind of social, political, economic and ideological interrelation is between them; And whether there is a possibility of integrating them
 ilit-study kaa ek doosraa aayam abhijanon or janata ke bich sambandhon kaa adhyayan he
 It tries to know how the communication of this kind of relationship takes place from top to bottom and bottom to top
 is sambadh kii kaamiyaan-kuubiyaan tay karti hai ki ilit ko pratisthapit karne kii ichha rakhane vaali takaton kii sthiti kya he
 It is only from this analysis that the reasons behind the peaceful or revolutionary methods for removing a particular elite were working
 america abhijan kaa adhyayan karne vaale si
 rhite mills ne ‘power ilit’ kii avadharana kaa sutrikaran kiya he
 According to Mills, three types of elites rule in the United States
 ye hai audyogic, raajnneetik faujee
 Interestingly, Mills, unlike other theorists, shows how the power elite created by this trio of elites is damaging to democracy
 abhijan siddhant ne samskruti-adhyayan ke kshetra main bhi hastkshep kiya he
 Critics of the rise of the mass society assume that contemporary mass media and the popular mass culture emanating from it are fatal to the superiority of the elite culture
 sambhraant varg kai prakaar ke ho sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye - Often a member of one type of elite is also a member of elite classes in other areas
 masalan dekha gaya he ki kai samaajon main sabase acchhee shiksha, sabase adhik dhan or sab se adhik rajnatik shakti ek hi varg ke logon main milti he

 khagolashastra main taron kii shreniyan unase aane vaali roshni ke varnakram ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 This spectrum shows what the temperature of the star is and what chemical elements are present inside it
 adhiktar taron ki varnakram par aadhaarit shreniyon ko angrezi ke O, B, A, F, G, k or m akshar naam ke rup main die gaye hai- Keep in mind that the colors of these stars may seem different from the colors mentioned in their category to a viewer
 taron ke shreneekaran ke liye in aksharon ke saath ek shunya se nau tak kaa ank bhi joda jaataa he jo do aksharon ke antaraal main taare kaa sthaan bataata he
 As such, "A5" is positioned exactly between "A0" and "F0"
 in akshar or ank ke peeche ek roman ank bhi joda jaataa he jo I, II, III, IV yaa v hota he 
 If a star is a Mahadanava, it gets a Roman numeral of I
 III kaa matlab he ke tara ek daanav tara he or v kaa matlab he ke yah ek bouna tara he 
 Our sun range is G2V or else it is a yellow dwarf star which is 2 steps towards the orange star
 akaash main sabase chamkile taare, vyaadh, kii shrenee A1V he
 The Harvard method is a method of dividing dwarf stars into categories
 dekha gaya he ke tara jitna nile kii taraf hota jaataa he utana hi garam hota he or utana hi bada hota he
 Shown below is the temperature of stars in different categories and the size and luminosity of our sun
 dhyaan rahe ke yah sirf mukhya anukram ke taron ke liye jaays he - In the period after 1880 AD, scientists working at the observatory of Harvard University made the categories of stars from 'A' to 'O'
 lekin 1920 ke dashak main bhartiya khagolvaigyanik meghnad saaha ne taron ke varnakram or unke satahi taapmaana main sambandh dikhaaya
 As the knowledge in this field grew, scientists changed the categories according to temperature and where the two categories were actually about stars of the same temperature, they were merged to remove one category
 saaha ke or anya vaigyanikon ke adhyayan se yah baat saafe ho gai ke OBAFGKM darasal satahi taapmaana kii shreniyan hai
 In 1943, three scientists working at the Yorkies Observatory created a new grading method for the spectrum of stars
 in vaigyanikon ke naam wiliam wilson morgan, philip si keenan or chhadisso kalman the isliye is pranali ko "MKK" vidhi bhi kaha jaataa he jo inke antim naamon ke pehle angrezi aksharon ko jodakar bana he
 Where Harvard grading runs only according to surface temperature and is used only for dwarf stars, both surface temperature and luminosity are used in the Yerkys grading and all the stars are graded
 daanav taare dravyaman main to boune taron jitna hi hote hai lekin unka vyas boune taron se zyaada hota he
 Therefore, gravity, gas density and pressure on the surface of the demon stars are much lower than the three dwarf stars
 is antar kaa varnakram par kaafii asar dekha ja saktaa he
 Due to the high pressure of the dwarf stars, the spectrum of their spectrum is "spread"

 We have seen all types of intrusive rocks such as ultra-basic rocks, mafic, neutral rock, acid rock, and alkaline rocks, as well as various types of magma volcanic eruptions, the magma they cleaned, but the depth of the source There are differences in channel content structure and degree
 deshi utthan megma megma bhinnata sahit or megma kii megma baahar remelting
 Earth's liquid layer is a variant of the original magma formed by the magma conformation of regeneration - after changes in temperature, structure and states of formation matter
 mobile power Magma from the depths of the Earth to move intrusive rocks formed within the surface layer or formed volcanic eruptions, there are two types of magma moving force: prithvi surya ke chaaron ore par taral parat bhitari kshetra or bahari kshetra ke anupaat se adhik he kyonki pehle, bhitari kshetra hameshaa gurutvkarshan ke vipareet disha main jhukaa hua he, gend prithvi ke kendra ke bheetar nahin he

 Second, the magma crystallization, or other physical and chemical reactions, resulting in some of the water and gas from the internal outward movement of the Earth to create pressure on the gas liquid magma and other materials to squeeze or erupt the surface
 gathan visheshtaon Intrusive igneous rocks are mainly two outputs type and discharge conditions
 The rocks penetrate a certain depth into a layer of lava formed by slow cooling rocks called intrusion
 Diagenetic consolidation infiltrating rocks takes longer
 Geologists have estimated, a 2000 m thick granite takes about 64,000 years of complete crystallization, forming a rock known as magma, or overflow, a condensate rock formation on the surface
 As the magma temperature accelerated rock rock rapidly, the diagenetic consolidation reduced a relatively short time
 1 meter thick basalt crystallization of all, you need 12 days, 10 meters thick takes three years, 700 meters thick needs 9,000 years
 Visible, the intrusive rocks consolidation of the required time is much higher than that of rocky rocks
 chipchipahat Viscosity is a very important property of magma, it represents the position and extent of slag flow
 Magma viscosity effect on silica content is increased, followed by aluminum oxide, chromium oxide, and their content, the viscosity will be significantly increased magma
 Acid rock silica, alumina content is high, therefore, the viscosity is also the largest, dissolving magmatic volatiles dissolved in the magma, and so that the magma crystallization time extension, flows easily, can reduce the melting point of minerals, in addition, The higher the magma temperature, the smaller the viscosity corresponding; As the magma pressure increases, the viscosity of the magma increases
 sanrachanaatmak visheshtaon Igneous rocks have their own unique structure and tectonic features, such as rocky rocks in temperature, the gaseous form formed under reducing conditions of sudden pressure, dissolves into the magma of a large number of unstable escapes in the form acinar structure
 The pores are well developed, the rock will become very light and can even float in water, forming floating rocks
 These holes are formed in the material after filling the vacancies, the almond-shaped structure is formed
 In the process of flowing lava surface flow, magma to the surface often leave traces, and sometimes it seems like many varieties twisted rope, rock scientist called rhyolite structure, rope structure
 Under the action of water, magma will form a lot of ellipsoid, called underwater explosion, lava pillow structure
 See these special structures exist only in igneous rocks

 However, some minerals, but only alkaline can be seen in igneous rocks

 Fearing the critics, Hardy quit writing novels and began writing poetry
 bees varsh tak unhone kavita likhi or apane liye khyaati ke nae dwaar khole
 Hardy continued to express his views in poetry as well, but the trauma expressed in the poems did not maim readers and critics to that extent
