 unhone 'prabal jati' kii avdhaaran prastut kii
 'mysore Narasimhachar Srinivas' was awarded the Padma Bhushan in the field of science and engineering by the Government of India in 1977
 ye karnataka se hai
 Even though the Adivasis of Indian Sociology may not be formalized, they have enriched this discipline in independent India with their theoretical contributions, unique understanding of caste and the method of participatory observation that they have given to the top sociologists of the country
 Enough to include
 samajashaastra main unhen samskruthikaran, prabhutvshaalee jati or vot bank jaisi moulik prasthaapanaaon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Srinivas was also the creator of the institutions
 baroda or dilli vishvavidhyalay main samajashaastra ke vibhaagon kii sthapana kaa shrey unheen ko jaataa he
 His contribution to the development of Indian sociology will also be considered as classical in terms of establishing and guiding high-level institutions of research and study
 gramin samudaay or jati kii sanrachana ke vishisht adhyayan ke alaava em
en
 shrinivas ne vigyaan ke saamaajik prabhaav, gandhi ke dharmik chintan, maanavshaastra ke itihaas se lekar gender jaise vishyon par bhi vicharottejak kaam kiya he
 Srinivas's work is considered to be a rare confluence of objective supervision, fineness of analysis and theoretical depth
 unka lekhan antar-vishyaktaa ko ek khaas tarah kaa jamini sandarbh pradaan karata he
 Srinivas's sociological vision explores the external structure of events and fathoms the structures and historical forces that compose them
 saamudayik jivan ke baarik byoron or antardrushtiyon ko saral bhashaa main prastut karne kii unki kshamta unhen samakaleen samajashastriyon se ek alag vyaktitv pradaan karti he
 In this sense, they transcend the thematic vocabulary and choose the simple and popular language
 ise unki vidvatta kaa janawaad hi kaha jayega ki unki saidhantik avadharanaayen apane kutarthon main uljhane ke bajaay vishay ko samajhane main zyaada madad karti hai
 Srinivas created a new land for Indian sociology at the level of ideology
 ullekhneey he ki jis daur main shrinivas bhartiya samaaj ke adhyayan kii taiyaari kar rahe the us samay samaaj-vigyaanon par america or british academik prasthapanaayen haaavee thi
 The prevailing approach in American universities emphasized Sanskritic traditions to understand the society of the Indian subcontinent
 iske asar main bhartiya samajashastri samakaleen yatharth ke adhyayan ke liye sanskrit ke sroton or bharat- vidya / indolji ko zyaada pramanik maanate the
 Srinivas was the first sociologist to challenge this dominant position
 unhone apane lekhan se sabit kiya ki samajashaastra main samaaj ke vaastavik kaaryakalapon or gatividhiyon kaa adhyayan shastreey sandarbhon par nirbhar rahane se zyaada shreyaskar he
 The concepts of dominant caste and Sanskritisation presented by Srinivas have been widely used by historians of streams like subaltern of history-writing besides political scientists
 is arth main unke krititv ko ek bauddhik parampara kii shrenee main rakhaa ja saktaa he jo naye-puraane vidwaanon ke liye ek zaruri sandarbh kii haisiyat hasil kar chukaa he
 Incidentally, the concept of dominant caste reflects dominance in a particular village or region of a caste due to factors such as number force, land ownership, education and job, so Sanskritisation is the culture of upper castes especially Brahmin class by lower castes
 Indicates the tendency to adopt customs, language and costumes etc
 haalaanki unki teesri avadharana vot bank, samaaj-vigyaanon main sthai jagah nahin bana paayi parantu raajnneeti ke dainik vimarsh or media jagat main is pad kaa dhadlle se istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In studying the political and social structure of independent India, all these three concepts and related discourse have acquired immediate significance
 prabhutvshaalee jati or samskruthikaran kii avadharanaayen bharat kii saamaajik vyavastha or uske santhnik dhaanche ke nirnaayak tattvon ko samajhane main madad karti hai
 Although the concept of Sanskritisation is no longer considered as important due to the decreasing legitimacy of Brahminical ideals, the fact remains that Sanskritisation was a fairly notable trend for a long period of the twentieth century and even after independence
 dalit andolan or mandal ayog ke baad ubhari raajnneeti main samskruthikaran kii pravriti ksheen hoti gayi he lekin prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana ko bharat ke gramin samaaj main chalane vaali raajnneetik prakriyaaon kaa vishleshan karne main aaj bhi ek jaruri aujaar kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 Many contemporary sociologists have been urging to assess Srinivas's work in the larger context of nationalist sociology
 unka kahana he ki swatantra bharat kaa shahari abhijan aupniveshik shashan ke aadhunikeekaran kii pariyojna ko jari rakhana chahta tha
 Therefore, the same colonial arrays of thought and thought were active in the work of nationalist sociologists on the basis of which the British power had been legitimizing its rule
 in vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki jati or samudaay par kendrit shrinivas jaise samajashastriyon kaa krititv ek akhil bhartiya sanskritvaadi hindu dharm kii samaj ko peethika pradaan karata he
 But Srinivas's vision is a hasty plea to be overtly or indirectly guided by the foundations of British or American anthropology, which, despite the lack of evidence, dares to prepare charge sheets
 yah daleel shrinivas ke krititv kii us pravriti ko lakshith karne main chook karti he jisamen shrinivas samudaay kaa adhyayan karte hue samudaay or apane sambandhon ke dwait par bhi vichaar karte hai
 Srinivas considers the basic foundations of sociology and anthropology in a similar way
 gauratlab he ki shrinivas sahabhaagi adhyeta ke taur par khud ko ek aise adhyeta ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai jisaki iyatta apane vishay yani logon se alag nahin he
 Srinivas did not classify the people or community he studied
 is sambandh main kai british maanavshastri yah maanate rahe hai apane samaaj kaa adhyayan karne vaale maanavshastri ko alag tarah kii mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 According to him, the anthropologist of the developed country always wants to imprison an indigenous anthropologist in a particular mold by pointing to his inferior position
 shrinivas ne is masale par deshaj maanavshastri kii sthiti ko spasht karte hue likhaa tha ki jab koi bhartiya maanavshastri bharat kii kisi jati yaa anya samooh kaa adhyayan karata he to vah jati yaa samooh uske liye anya bhi hota he lekin saath hi is baat ko darkinar nahin karnaa chahie ki us jati yaa samooh ke katipay saanskrithik rup, vishwaas or mulya ukt adhyeta se bhi mail khate hai
 That is, in such a situation the Indian anthropologist actually studies the self in one way or the other
 is myne main vah jati yaa samooh uske liye nitant aparichit yaa anya nahin rah jaataa kyonki donon ek hi samskruti se jude hote hai
 Srinivas considers this situation as unusually complex, multilayered and duplex
 dhyaan se dekhen to shrinivas apane vishay ke saath antar or samanta ke jin binduon baat karte hai unhen dekhte hue un par rashtravaadi samajashastri hone kaa aarope damdaar nahin lagata
 In fact, Srinivas stresses that this multiplicity of self and others in study is far better than the anthropologist's singularity of being a member or an outsider of his community
 yah gauratlab he ki apane shodh adhyayan ke liye shrinivas ne jis rampura gaanv ko chunaa tha uski jati vyavastha ke adhyayan main ve chicago skool ke kai prekshanon kaa upyog karte hai
 Srinivas proving the pre-british concept of varna as a bookish point of view, saying that this vision dwarfs the dynamic aspects of caste
 haalaanki shrinivas kaa jati-adhyayan ek gaanv kii sthaneey sanrachana par kendrit tha lekin vah is parighatna kii akhil bhartiya vyapti ko lekar bhi sachet the
 In one of his articles, he points to the fact that caste is undoubtedly an all-india structure, as groups can be seen everywhere in the country that form a distinct group based on paternal and marital relationships
 shrinivas is sambandh main in samoohon ke parmparik rojgaar kaa hawala bhi dete hai
 He also says that the existence of castes serving Brahmins, untouchables, farmers, artisans, merchants and others can be seen everywhere in the country
 jati ke is adhyayan main shrinivas kshetreey bhinnataaon or pashchimi shiksha, prashasnic naukari, shahar se milane vaali aay jaise karkon kaa bhi ullekh karte hai jinka jati kii sanrachana par vyapak asar padaa he
 In the long term, Srinivas, as a sociologist, has also freed the Indian village and caste structure from the theoretical dominance of colonial perceptions
 or saath hi dyumon jaise samajashastri kii manyataon kaa bhi pratwaad kiya jo yah pratipaadit kar rahe the ki jatigat vibhinnataayen bhartiya gaanv ko samudaay kaa rup nahin lene detii
 When Srinivas talks about the concept of rural community and the economic-cultural interdependence of villages, he also talks about All India Civilization in a latent manner
 kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki shrinivas ne jati ke adhyayan main brahmanvaadi yaa ucch jati kaa drushtikon apanaaya he
 But looking at this argument from the right angle, it seems to have originated from colonial sociology
 shrinivas kii tark-yojana vastav main pashchimi samajashastriyon kii bharat ke gramin samudaayon ke sambandh main pratipaadit sthool or alp-chintit dharanaon ko ujagar karti he
 In a nutshell, Srinivas's work provides many basic arguments in the Western discourse of philosophical propositions, perceptions of self, community and nation

 isliye em bi foster ne unako vishwa kaa sabase mahaan krambaddh vichaarak kaha he
 In fact, St
 Thomas Aquinas has represented the overall political thinking of the medieval period, according to Foster, he represents all medieval ideas as no one else could

 His parents forced him to give up membership by giving him many temptations but his determination did not listen to him
 isliye vah dharmik shiksha praapt karne ke liye paris chalaa gaya
 There he received religious education by sitting at the feet of spiritual leader Albert the Great
 iske baad usne 1252 i main adhyayan va adhyaapan kaary main ruchi lee or usne italy ke anek shikshan sansthaanon main padhaayaa

 The philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas is reflected in his two compositions 'de Regimene Principum' and 'commentary on Aristotiles Politics'
 in rachanaaon main rajya va carch ke sambandhon ke saath-saath anya samasyaon par bhi charchaa hui he
 These compositions are considered to be the essence of state and church relations
 ye rachanaayen rajya va carch ke sambandhon kaa saar maani jaati hai
 'summa Theologica' is also considered to be one of the great texts of Aquinas, in which the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle is coordinated with Roman law and Christian philosophy

 This philosophy relies on Christian revelation, which is superior to philosophy and science
 dharm-vigyaan yaa dharm-darshan us pranali ko puraa kar detaa he jiske armbh bindu vigyaan or darshan hai
 Just as Vivek is the basis of philosophy, faith is the basis of theology
 in donon main koi virodh nahin he
 They complement each other
 atah donon kaa mishran gyaan kii imaarat ko majboot banaata he
 Aquinas believes that theology is the absolute knowledge that keeps other branches of knowledge - ethics, political science and economics under control

 Cosmetics are both natural or artificial

 These are applied to increase the smell and beauty of a person's body
 sharir ke kisi ang par soundarya prasaadh lagane ko 'mek-ap' kehete hai

 Human nature has always strived to keep its body parts pure, healthy, shapely and beautiful, and the skin smooth, soft, radiant and radiant
 isamen koi andeh nahin ki shaareerik swasthya or saundarya praaia: manushya ke aantarik swasthya or maansik shuddhi par nirbhar he

 In the perspective of India, the creation and use of cosmetic, fragrance etc
 have been considered as a means of social welfare and religious inspiration, not as provocative of human vengeful desires
 arya samskruti main angaraag or gandh shaastra kaa mahatv prayek sadgruhasth ke dainik jivan main utana hi aavashyak rahaa he jitna panch mahayajna or varnashram dharm kii maryaada kaa paalan

 According to the treatise called Gangadharrita Gandasara, the following six types of methods were mainly used in the manufacture of cosmetics in the then India
 1
 bhavan kriya - churna kiye hue padaarthon ko taral dravyon se anubiddh karnaa
 2
 Digestion - By mixing and mixing various substances by boiling
 3
 bodh kriya - gunavardhak padaarthon ke sanyog se punaruttejit karnaa
 4
 Vedha Kriya - To make cosmetics useful by combining healthy and dermatological substances
 5
 dhupan kriya - sougandhik dravyon ke dhuon se suvasit karnaa
 6
 Vasana Kriya - To facilitate the combination of aromatic oils and other fluids
 raghuvansh, rutusanhaar, maltimadhav, kumaar sambhav, kadambari, harshcharit or pali granthon main varnit vividh angaraagon main nimnlikhit dravyon kaa vistrut vidhaan paaya jaataa he

; a variety of oils, incense and haircut, etc

 for the body, local powder and fenc etc
 and mukhavasa, orbital and grihavas etc
 in angaraagon or sugandhon kii rachana ke liye anbhavi shastron tathaa prayogadi ke liye prasaadhakon tathaa prasadhikaaon ko vishesh rup se shikshit or abhyast karnaa aavashyak samajha jaataa tha
 By the scientific art of cosmology, creative and experimental legislation is done by all those cosmetics, using which the various organs of human body and skin can be proved healthy by keeping the skin healthy, flawless, formless, radiant and beautiful
 bharat main puraatan kaal se angaraag sambandhi vividh prashaadhan dravyon kaa nirmaan prakritik or mukhyatya vanaspatik sansadhano dwaara hota rahaa he
 But with the advancement of modern science in the present era, the expansion of the number of resources used in the creation and use of cosmetics has increased so much that learning of this subject like other scientific subjects is possible only by special efforts
 aadhunik kaal main vishesh prakaar ke sabunon tathaa angaraagon kaa vistaar or prachaar shaareerik saundaryavriddhi ke liye hi nahin apitu shaareerik doshapchaar ke liye bhi bad rahaa he
 Therefore, in order to keep such formal cosmetics separate from medicines, the manufacture and sale of these substances in the United States and other foreign countries is being tightly controlled by government laws
 aajkal ke sarvasangat siddhant ke anusaar nimnlikhit padaarth hi angaraag ke antargat rakhe ja sakate hai: 1
 The substances that are used for the beauty of the body, not the equipment of these cosmetics
 is drushti se kanghee, ustara, daanton or baalo ke burush ityadi angaraag nahin kahe ja sakate
 2
 Cosmetics can be stored in hair washing liquid, shaving soap, emulsions and lotions etc
, but nahaane ke sabun nahin
 3
 Such formal substances are also kept in cosmetic products which, despite being as effective as medicines, are mainly for body purification
 prayukt hote hai, jaise pasinaa kam karne vaali prashaadhan aadi
 4
 Those substances which are essentially used only on the human body, not to keep the home, and the places of fun, etc
 fragrant

 Others Others: According to Ibn al-salah, the actual title of the book commonly known as the correct al-bukhari is: "al-jami 'al-sahih al-musnad al-mukhtasar Min Umuri Rasulillahi and Sunnahi and Ayyamhi"
 sheershak kaa ek shabd-se-shabd anuwaad he: paigambar, unke prathaon or unke kaal ke sambandh main jude maamalon ke sambandh main pramanik haddees kaa sangrah
 Ibn Hajar al-asaklani referred to the same title, in which the word Umur was replaced with the word hadith
 al bukhari 16 saal kii umr se abbasid khilaafat main vyapak rup se yatra karte the, un paramparaon ko ikattha karte the jinhen vah bharosemand mana tha
 It is reported that al-bukhari devoted 16 years of his life in collecting about 600,000 mentions in this collection

 'this suggestion stayed in my heart, so i started compiling Sahih
 " bukhari ne yah bhi kaha, "maine paigambar ko ek sapane main dekha or aisa lagata tha ki main unke saamne khadaa tha
 i had a fan in my hand that i was protecting them
 maine kuch khwab kii tabir bataane waalon se puchha, to unhon ne mujh se kaha ki "aap unhen jhooth se bachaayenge"
 "this is what had me intent on producing Sahih
 " This book covers almost all aspects of life in providing proper guidance to Islam such as the method of praying and other works of the Ibadat by Prophet Muhammad

 It was also famous that after the death of the author, people started considering this book as an amendment and it became a historical record
 choubees varsh kii is avadhi ke dauraan, al bukhari ne apni pustak main maamuli sanshodhan kiye, vishesh rup se adhyay sheershak
 Each version is named by its descriptor
 ebn hajar al- asakalani ke anusaar unki kitaab nukta main, sabhi sanskarnon main haddees kii sankhya samaan he
 The most famous is the version described by al-firabari, a trusted student of Bukhari
 al-khatib al-bagdadi ne apni pustak itihaas baghdad main phirabari ko yah kehete hue uddhrut kiya: "sattar hajaar logon ne mere saath sahahi bukhari ko suna"
 Firabri was not the only spreader of al-bukhari
 ibrahim ebn maqal, hamma ebn shaker, mansoor barduzi or hossain mahamili ne agali pidiyon ko is kitaab ke zariye padhaaya or failaayaa
 There are many books which differed, among which is the most Ahm Fattah al-bari
 ullekhneey islamic vidwaan amin ahsaan islahi ne sahi al bukhari ke teen utkrisht gun soochibaddh kiye hai: Ibn al-salah said: "the first Bukhari to authorize Sahih was Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Ismail al-zufi, followed by Abu ibn al-usain Muslim ibn al-anjaz ek-naysaburi al-kushairi, who was his student
 , Used to share the same teacher
 ye do pustaken quran ke baad sabase pramanik kitaaben hai
 As for the statement of al-shafi'i, who said, "I do not know of a book containing knowledge more than the book of Malik," - others mention it with a different word - he said this before the books of Bukhari and Muslim
 bukhari kii kitaab do or adhik upyogi donon ke liye adhik pramanik he
 " ebn hajar al- asaklani ne abu jafar al-ukvilla ko uddhrut karte hue kaha, "bukhari ne sahih likhaa tha, unhone ise ali ebn al-madini, ahamed ebn hanabal, yahya ebn mine ke saath-saath anya logon ko bhi padhaa
 He considered it a good effort and testified to its authenticity with the exception of four hadiths
 al-akvilla ne tab kaha ki bukhari vastav main un chaar haddees ke bare main sahi the
 "ibn Hajar then concluded," and they are truly authentic
 " Ibn al-salah said in his Muqaddimah ibn al-ila'ah fe 'ulam al-adid: "it is told to us that Bukhari has said,' i have not included in the book al-jami 'that which is authentic and i did Other authentic hadiths for the minority are not included
 '" iske alaava, al-dhahabi ne kaha," bukhari ne yah kehete hue suna tha,' maine ek sau hajaar pramanik haddees or do sau hajaar yaad kiye hai jo pramanik se kam hai
 '" mahila netritv ke sambandh main bukhari main kam se kam ek prasiddh haad haddees, isaki saamagree or uske haddees kathakaar ke aadhaar par likhi gayi, jisko kuch lekhakon ne pramanik nahin mana
 Shehadeh uses gender theory to criticize hadiths, while Farooq believes that such hadiths are incompatible for reforming Islam
 effi or efi sharia kaanoon ke liye haddees ke bajaaye samakaleen vyakhya par charchaa karnaa chaahate hai

 imam jarkashi haddees sangrah main hazarat aaisha dwaara suchit haddees main spashtikaran diya gaya he: "

 He only heard the end of it
 paigambar ne kya kaha tha: 'allaah yahudiyon ko khaarij kare; ve kehete hai ki teen chijen buree kismat laati hai: ghar, mahila or ghode
 "'in this case the question has been raised as to whether other hadiths in Bukhari have received proper reference notice of incomplete and deficient sahi bukhari paigambar ke dawa or upachaar ke tareeke or hijama jise ashastreey hone kii sambhaavna pesh kii gai he
 Sunni scholar Ibn Hajar al-asaklani, based on archaeological evidence, criticized the hadith, stating that this hadith claims that Adam's height was 60 cubits and that human height has been decreasing since then
 ebn al-salaah ne yah bhi kaha: "haddees kii kitaab, sahih main 7,275 haddees he, jisamen kuch hadisen baar-baar doharaai bhi gayi hai
 It has been said that this number is 2,230, except for repeated hadiths
 " yah un haddees kaa zikr kar rahe hai ho musnad hai, jo mohammad se utpann hokar sahyogiyon dwaara pramanik hai
 One of the most important aspects in Sahih al-bukhari is the name of the Tarjuma al-bab or that chapter

 is darshanaparampara ko pusht karanevaalon main zeenon ke atirikt, clianthis or crissippas ke naam liye jate hai
 "stoic philosophy" is presented in three parts - logic, physics and policy
 stoic darshanikon ko aflatoon or arestu kaa pratyaywad sweekaarya na laga
 In his view, external suffixes from consciousness have no power
 ve maatr vichaar hai, jinhen man vastuon se alag karke dekhtaa he
 They did not want to make knowledge as a work of the mind, making it a destitute fantasy
 isliye unhone kaha, gyaan indriyadvaron se hokar man tak pahunchataa he
 It was the Stoic philosophers who first put the mind at bay
 kintu, aadhunik angrej vichaarak jon lock kii bhanti, stoic man ko niskriy graahak nahin maanate the
 They considered him to be active
 par man kii kriyasheeltaa ke liye andrik pradatton kii ve aavashyaktaa samajhate the
 This is why we remember the Stoic philosophers, reading the Enlightenment of the German philosopher Emmanuel Kant
 kintu gyaan kii utpatti main man kii moulikta nasht kar dene par gyaan kii satyata ke prasang main stoikon ko usee prakaar kii kathinaaiyo kaa anubhav hua jaisi kathinaaiyaan lock or kaant ke saamne aage chalakar upasthit huin
 He considered knowledge to be real
 vastuen indriyon par apane prabhaav chhodti hai
 It is through these that the mind knows things
 ab prashn uthta he ki andrik prabhaavon kii madhyamikta se man jis vastujgat ko jaanata he, vah usase bahya he, to gyaan kii satyata kii pariksha kisi ho sakati he? sabhi yathartwaadiyon ke liye yah ek kadi gutthi he
 Or, like Henry Bergs, acceptance of insubordination
 stoikon ne aisa kuch to mana na tha
 Therefore they had to believe that the truths are more obvious than the effects or reflections of objects, dreams and mere imaginations
 ve apni jeevantta se hamaare bheetar satyata kii bhaavana yaa vishwaas utpann karte hai
 This subjective feeling or belief is the test of truth
 is prakaar stoic darshanikon ne gyanatmak vyaktvaad kaa bijwapan kiya
 The first belief of the stoics under physics was that no body could exist
 unhone gyaan ko bhautik samvednaa par aadhaarit kiya tha
 Therefore it was necessary to accept the power of matter, which we know by sensory sensation
 kintu ve sattatmak dwait athwa bahutv ko sweekaar karnaa ayukt samajhate the
 He was monotheistic and therefore the only power of substance for him
 par unhone aatma or ishwar kaa niraakaran nahin kiya
 He is also given a place in matter itself
 ishwar or aatma sambandhi paramparaagat vichaaron se yah mat bhinn avashya he kintu stoic darshanikon ne avirodh ke niyam ke aagrah se hi ise sweekaar kiya tha
 His epistemology was proving the power of matter
 sansar kii ekta kii vyakhya ke nimitt use ek hi strot se udbhut maananaa uchit tha
 Considering the relation between soul and body, he also felt the same rational
 aatma or sharir ek duusare par kriyaayein or pratikriyaayein karte hai
 The soul is the consciousness or intelligence of the body
 aatma kii sthapana karne ke saath hi vaishv chetana yaa vaishv buddhi kii sthapana aavashyak ho jaati he
 Therefore, he considered the same relationship between God and the world as between personal intelligence and body
 in vichaaron kaa unhone unani darshan ke pracheen praathmik saamagree yaa upadan ke vichaar ke saath samanvay kiya
 Heraclitus said in the sixth century BCE, fire is the primary element that created the world
 stoic darshanikon ko agni or buddhi main swabhavsamya dikhaai diya or unhone kaha ki praathmik agni hi ishwar he
 In this way, he established an omnivism, in which there was no fundamental difference between the fundamental factor of the world or the meaning of nature, God, soul, intellect and matter
 is manyata ke aadhaar par stoikon ko yah maanane main koi kathinaayee na thi ki vishwa bauddhik niyam ke adheen he
 In this way, Stoic philosophers, while endorsing materialism, found a wider and more conscious purpose for the interpretation of the system, consistency, beauty, etc
 of the world
 kintu ab unke paas vyakti kii swatantraaa kii sthapana ke liye koi uchit tark nahin rah gaya tha
 Due to the prevalence of intellectual law in his nature, everything he does is natural, intellectual
 yah vahi kathinaayee thi jo german darshanik emanuel kaant ke naitik man main aakar atak gai
 But Stoic philosophers descended from the theoretical level and gave a practical answer
