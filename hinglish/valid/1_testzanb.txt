 ye naatak shilp or samvednaa ke str par achche hai lekin unki kahaniyon or upanyaason ne itani oonchaai praapt kar lee thi ki naatak ke kshetra main premchand ko koi khaas safalataa nahin mili

 Translated 'tolstoy's Stories', three plays of Galsvardi under the names 'strike', 'silver Ki Dibiya' and 'nyaya'
 unke dwaara ratannath sarshar ke urdu upanyaas 'fasaan-e-aaazaad' kaa hindi anuwaad 'aaazaad katha' bahut mashhoor hua
 Premchand came to Hindi with the rite of Urdu and became a great Hindi writer
 hindi ko apana khaas muhaavara or khulaapan diya
 Both the story and the novel made epoch-making changes
 unhone sahitya main samayikta prabal aagrah sthapit kiya
 He made the common man the subject of his creations and, by openly penning his problems, placed him on the post of heroes of literature
 premchand se pehle hindi sahitya raja-rani ke kisson, rahasy-romaanch main ulajhaa hua tha
 Premchand took literature to the surface of truth
 unhone jivan or kalkhand kii sachai ko panne par utaara
 He continued to write for a lifetime on communalism, corruption, zamindari, indebtedness, poverty, colonialism
 premachand kii zyaadaatar rachanaaen unki hi garibi or dainyata kii kahani kahati he

 Premchand is the era promoter of Hindi literature
 unhone hindi kahani main aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad kii ek nai parampari shuru kii
 Despite being such a great creator, Premchand's life is not free from accusations
 premchand ke adhyeta kamalkishor goyanka ne apni pustak 'premchand : adhyayan kii nai dishaaen' main premchand ke jivan par kuch aarope lagaakar unke sahitya kaa mahatv kam karne kii koshish kii
 The main allegations against Premchand are- Premchand left his first wife without any reason and even after second marriage, he had a relationship with another woman, Premchand cheated Vinodashankar Vyas in 'jagran Brawl', Premchand's senior press Employee Pravasi Lal Verma Frauded, Workers Strike in Premchand's Press, Premchand Supports Flick When His Daughter Sick Took more
 kamalkishor goyanka dwaara lagaae gaye ye aarope premchand ke jivan kaa ek paksh jarur hamaare saamne laate hai jisamen unki insaani kamajoriyon jaahir hoti hai lekin unke vyapak sahitya ke moolyankan par in aaropon kaa koi asar nahin pad paaya he
 People remember Prem Chandra today because of his ability which gives very little space to controversies
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke
 At that time Bankim was Babu, Sharat Chandra and in addition there were Russian writers like Tolstoy
 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
 jab bharat kaa swatantraaa andolan chal rahaa tha tab unhone katha sahitya dwaara hindi or urdu donon bhashaaon ko jo abhivyakti di usne siyaasi sargarmi ko, josh ko or andolan ko sabhi ko ubhaara or use taaqatvar banaaya or isse unka lekhan bhi taaqatvar hota gaya
 Premchand can certainly be called the first progressive writer of Hindi in this sense
 1936 main unhone pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan ko sabhapati ke rup main sambodhan kiya tha
 His speech became the basis of the manifesto of the progressive movement
 premchand ne hindi main kahani kii ek parampara ko janm diya or ek puri peedi unke kadamon par aage badi, 50-60 ke dashak main renu, nagarjun auki inke baad shrinath singh ne gramin parivesh kii kahaniyaan likhi hai, wo ek tarah se premchand kii parampara ke taratamya main aati hai
 Premchand was a revolutionary creator, he saw not only patriotism but also many evil practices prevalent in the society and put them before the people through the story
 unhone us samay ke samaaj kii jo bhi samasyaayen thim un sabhi ko chitrit karne kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 Dalits also come in it, women also
 ye sabhi vishay aage chalakar hindi sahitya ke bade vimarsh bane

 This book was first published in 1944, but its importance in the field of literature can be gauged from the fact that it was revised and published again in 2005, the work was done by his grandson Prabodh Kumar

 manovaigyanik rachanaaon main fyodor dostoyevski hi tolastay ke samakaksh thaharte hai
 Tolstoy has a notable influence on great writers such as Galsvardi, Thomas Mann, Jules Romeo, etc
 parvarti roosi lekhakon ko bhi tollstoy ne yathesht prabhavit kiya he
 Many scholars of the world, including Lenin, have accepted the best of Tolstoy's literature, especially 'war and Peace', from Muktakantha; But Tolastoy was also a thinker and expressed his ideas in literary works as well as in essays and other genres
 unke yugin sandarbh vichaaron kii upyogita ke sambandh main lenin kaa maananaa he ki "tolastoy ne aisa lalit sahitya rachaa he, jo tab janata ke liye sadaa moolyawaan or pathneey hoga, jab vah jameendaaron or puunjipatiyon kaa takhta ulat kar apane liye manuyochit saamaajik jivan kii vyavastha kar legi
 At the same time, Tolstoy has been able to express the mood of the general public and describe his condition, and express his spontaneous feelings of protest and fury with remarkable oz
 tolastoy mukhyatah 1861 se 1904 tak ke yug ke the or unhone -- ek kalakaar, vichaarak evam upadeshak ke naate -- apni kritiyon main samoochee pratham roosi kranti kii aitihaasik vishistataaon ko, uski kshamtaaon or trutiyon ko ascharyajanak spashtataa ke saath ubhaara he
 " iske baavjood pracheen vyavastha kii vividh khaamiyon, amir varg kii aantarik nissartaa tathaa uske viruddh prakat tolastoy ke vichaaron ke sandarbh main lenin kaa kahana he ki "tolastoy kii aalochana main koi nayi baat nahin thi
 He did not say anything that had not been said to him long ago by the advocates of the working people in European and Russian literature
 tolastoy kii aalochana kii visheshta evam aitihaasik mahatv is baat main he ki hamaare vichaaradhin kaal ke rus -- dehati, kisaanon ke rus -- ke vyapak jan samudaay ke drushtikon main jo amul parivartan aa rahaa tha, uski abhivyakti usamen aise ojase kii gayi he, jo kisi pratibhavan kalakaar ke hi bas kaa kaam tha
 " tolastoy ke saahitiyik mahatv ko lenin bakhubi samajhate the or isliye unhone uski baari prashansa bhi kii he; parantu saath-saath yugin sandarbh main unke vichaaron ke kai hanikaarak pahaluon se sachet rahane kii anivaaryta bhi ve acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Therefore, in December 1910, he had explicitly expressed the idea that by studying Tolstoy's literary works, the Russian working class would be able to recognize its enemies better
 unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karke samast roosi janata yah jarur jaanegi ki uski nijee kamajori, jisane use apni aazaadee kaa lakshya puraa karne se roka, kis baat main nihit thi
 It is important to know in order to move forward
 is pragati main vah sab log baadha daal rahe hai, jo tolastoy ko 'ham sabakaa antahkaran', 'jivan-shikshak' ghoshit karte hai
 This is the lie that liberals are deliberately spreading as they want to use the anti-revolution aspect of Tolstoy's principles
 tolastoy ke 'jivan-shikshak' hone kaa jhooth udaarataavaadiyon kii dekha-dekhi kuch bhootpurv saamaajik-janavaadee bhi duhara rahe hai
 The Russian people will gain independence only if they understand that they have to learn to fight for a better life, not from Tolstoy, but from a class whose importance Tolstoy could not understand and that old world, which Tolstoy hated
 , Is the only class capable of overthrow - that is, from the proletariat
 22 janvari 1911 ko lenin ne punah vistaar se tolastoy kii kuch kathatmak rachanaaon ke saath-saath anek cathetar rachanaaon kaa udhaaharan dete hue yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastowad main pratikriyaavaadi tathaa utapian tatv hone ke baavjood aaj se 25 varsh pehle janata ke kuch halkon ke liye shaayad kabhi-kabhi tolastoy ke siddhanton ke aalochanatmak tatwon kii vyavhaarik upyogita ho sakati thi
 But now, for example in the last decade, such a thing could not happen, because from the ninth decade of the last century to the end of the century, historical development has moved very far
 atah aaj jab uparokt ghatnaon ne 'purvi' gatiheenata kaa ant kar diya he, aaj, jab 'vekhi'-panthiyon ke sachetan rup se pratikriyaavaadi, sankeern-vargeey tathaa swaarthee-vargeey arthon main pratikriyaavaadi vichaar udaaravaadi burjua logon main itane vyapak rup se fail gayi hai, aaj, jab in vichaaron kii chhot kuch dikhaau marxvaadiyon ko bhi lag gayi he, jiskaa parinaam 'visarjanwaadee' pravriti he, to tolastoy ke siddhanton ko adarsh bataane, unke 'apratirodh' unki 'aatma' kii duhaayiyon, 'atmoddhar' ke liye unke aahvaan, 'antahkaran' or vishwa 'prem' ke siddhant, tapasyavaad or quaitism ke unke upadesh, aadi-aadi ko uchit tehraane yaa un par lipapoti karne kii har koshish pratyakshtam or gahanatam haani hi karti he

 These treaties were called festivals

 yah shabd dravid shabd `pus' kaa paryaay he, jiskaa arth `pushp' hotahai
 Dravid's other word is 'J', which means to do
 is prakaarpuje kaa arth hua `pushpakarm'
 The Yajna of the Aryans was an animal work, but the 'pushpakarma' of the Dravidas
 kaalaantar main aaryon ne pushpakarm grahan kar use puja kanaam de diya
 There is also a Dravidian metal `pusu 'which means lepan
 lepanse chandan yaa sindur lepan kaa arth bhi nikalataa he
 Thus, where the reputation of the Goddess is a non-aryan system, worship is also a Dravidian or Igneous practice, thus the ancient festival of Diwali, which was actually Ayan Yajna, became a festival of Lakshmi Puja consisting of Dravidian and Igneous cultures

 inamen jo hastivrittikthe, unhone ukt onkaar ke mangalacharan ko hathi kaa rup dekar ganesh kaa vart-maanaroop bana diya
 In this regard, there are some verses in the Ganesha Purana which confirm our opinion - Lord Yo Vedadi in the form of Anukar is revered:

 Ganesha's imagination was initially established as Vighnesh
 manushya kii deh par hathi kaa bhayaavah rup dekh bhay se unhenpoojane lage

 puranic samaaj main ve vighn har hi maanejate hai
 But in North India, their idols are made small
 dakshin ke mandiron main badi-badi vishaal murtiyon hai
 Which is also terrible

 But South Indians consider them as brahmacharis

 Ganesha Puja must have started in the fifth-sixth century of Vikram
 kyonki puranonmen uski charchaa he
 It is already in the systems
 buddha or mahavir ne ganesh kanaam nahin liya
 But when the Aryans accepted Shitaladhavi, a donkey-riding Bhairav, riding on a donkey from the neighboring non-aryans as a deity, then the monkey vehicle Vighnesh Ganesha was also accepted and wrangled them

 usne aurangzeb ko dakkan ke soobedaar ke ohade se barkhaast kar diya
 Aurangzeb could not come to the court for 7 months
 baad main shahjahan ne use gujarat kaa soobedaar banaaya
 Aurangzeb ruled smoothly and received the title of the same, he was made the governor of Badakhshan and Balkh region
 iske baad use multan or sindh kaa bhi governor banaaya gaya
 During this time he kept fighting with the Persians of Persia for control over Kandahar, but if he got anything other than defeat, it was his father's neglect
 1652 main use dakkan kaa soobedaar fir se banaaya gaya
 He fought against Golconda and Bijapur and at the decisive moment Shah Jahan withdrew the army

 daara shukoh, shah suja or aurangzeb main satta sangharsh chalane laga
 Shah Suza, who had declared himself as the Governor of Bengal, had to go to the Arakan region of Burma, and in 1659 Aurangzeb, after arresting Shah Jahan at the Taj Mahal for the royal treasury, declared himself king
 daara shikoh ko rajdroh ke zurm main phaansi de di gai
 Aurangzeb never spent the royal treasury on his own

 It is a well-known fact about Mughal history that in comparison to other kings, Aurangzeb's reign was more part of Hindu administration
 aitihaasik tathy bataate hai ki aurangzeb ke pita shahjahan ke shasankaal main sena ke vibhinn padon, darbar ke duusare ahm padon or vibhinn bhugolic prashasnic ikaayiyon main hinduon kii taadaad 24 fisadi thi jo aurangzeb ke samay main 33 fisadi tak ho gai thi
 In the words of m Athar Ali, this fact is the strongest evidence against the notion that the emperor sided with the Hindu mansabdars
 aurangzeb kii sena main varisht padon par badi sankhya main rajput niyukt the
 Aurangzeb's attack against the Marathas and the Sikhs is viewed through religious spectacles but it is ignored when concluding that the Mughal army was often commanded by a Rajput commander in the war zone
 itihaaskaar yadunath sarkaar likhte hai ki ek samay khud shivaji bhi aurangzeb kii sena main manasabadaar the
 It is said that he was supposed to be the head of the Mughal Sultanate in South India but failed to realize his military prowess, Aurangzeb did not approve this appointment
 aurangzeb pavitra jivan vyateet karata tha
 In his personal life he was an ideal man
 vah un sab durgunon se sarvatra mukt tha, jo asia ke raajaaon main samanytah the
 He lived the Yeti-life
 khaane-pine, vesh-bhusha or jivan kii anya sabhi-suvidhaon main vah sanyam baratata tha
 While busy with the heavy work of administration, he used to take time to earn some money by copying the Quran and sealing the caps to meet his needs
 aurangzeb hi nahin sabhi madhyakaalin bharat ke tamaam muslim baadshahon ke bare main ek baat yah bhi kahi jaati he ki unamem se koi bhartiya nahin tha
 At one level, this is childish and meaningless because the concept of nation did not exist anywhere in 17th century India
 haalanki iske baad bhi yah baat kam se kam aurangzeb ke maamle main lagu nahin hoti
 This Mughal emperor was a staunch upper-class Hindustani
 iskaa sidhaa tark yahi he ki uskaa janm gujarat ke dahod main hua tha or uskaa paalan poshan ucchwargeey hindustani pariwaron ke bacchon kii tarah hi hua
 The Braj language and its literature were always patronized throughout the Mughal period and this tradition continued even during the rule of Aurangzeb
 colombia uniwarsity se judi itihaaskaar ellison bush bataati hai ki aurangzeb ke darbar main braj ko protsaahan dene vaala maahaul tha
 The king's son Azam Shah had a keen interest in Braj poetry
 braj sahitya ke kuch bade naamon jaise mahakavi dev ko usne sangrakshan diya tha
 Vrind, another great poet of the same language, was also employed in Aurangzeb's administration
 mughalkaal main darbar kii aadhikarik lekhan bhashaa farsi thi lekin aurangzeb kaa shashan aane se pehle hi badshaah se lekar darbariyon tak ke bich prachlit bhashaa hindi-urdu ho chuki thi
 This can also be understood from Aurangzeb's letter he wrote to his 47-year-old son Azam Shah
 badshaah ne apane bete ko ek kila bhent kiya tha or is maukey par nagaade bajwane kaa aadesh diya
 In a letter to Azam Shah, Aurangzeb has written that when he was a child, he loved the voice of the drums and often said, 'babaji dhan-dhan!' It can be said from this example that Aurangzeb's son used to talk to his father in the then prevalent Hindi
 samraat aurangzeb ne islam dharm ke mahatv ko sweekaarte hue ‘quran’ ko apane shashan kaa aadhaar banaaya
 He prohibited kalma khudvana on coins, celebrating the festival of nauroz, cultivating hemp, singing and playing etc

 main hindu tyohaaron par pratibandh laga diya
 In 1699 AD, he ordered the destruction of Hindu temples
 bade-bade nagaron main aurangzeb dwaara ‘muhatsib’ ko niyukt kiya gaya
 In 1669, Aurangzeb broke the 'vishwanath Temple' of Benares and the 'keshav Rai Mandir' of Mathura
 usne sharia ke viruddh liye jane vaale lagbhag 80 karon ko samaapt karvaa diya
 These included local taxes called ‘raidari’ and ‘pandari’ also known as ‘abwab’
 aurangzeb ‘daarul herb’ ko ‘daarul islam’ main parivartit karne ko apana mahatvapurn lakshya maanata tha
 In Aurangzeb's time, pilgrims coming to Brij were heavily taxed, Jiziya tax was re-imposed and Hindus were converted to Muslims
 us samay ke kaviyon kii rachanaaon main aurangzeb ke atyaacharon kaa ullekh he
 The Jaziya tax levied by Aurangzeb was at that time
 akbar ne jajia kar ko samaapt kar diya tha, lekin aurangzeb ke samay yah dobaaraa lagu kiya gaya
 Jaziya was different from normal taxes that non-muslims had to pay
 iske teen str the or iskaa nirdhaaran sambandhit vyakti kii aamadani se hota tha
 There were some exceptions to this tax
 garibon, berozegaron or shaareerik rup se ashakt log iske daayre main nahin aate the
 Apart from these, Brahmins and government officials who were at the top of the varna system of Hindus were also out of it
 musalamaanon ke upar lagane vaala aisa hi dharmik kar jakaat tha jo har amir musalmaan ke liye dena zaruri tha 
 Jaziya was certainly a biased tax system on the norms of modern values
 aadhunik raashtra, dharm or jati ke aadhaar par is tarah kaa bhed nahin kar sakate
 That is why when we look at the 17th century system on the scale of modern nations, it may seem very chaotic, but it was not so during Aurangzeb
 us daur main iske duusare udhaaharan bhi milte hai
 As the Marathas evicted the Mughals from a large part of the south
 unki kar vyavastha bhi takreeban isi str kii pakshpaati thi
 They used to collect zakat from Muslims and the Hindu population was out of any such tax system
 aurangzeb ne jitne mandir tudwaaye, usase kahin zyada banawaye the
 According to the famous historian Richard Eaton, demolition of temples was a rare occurrence in the Mughal period and whenever it happened it was political because of it
 iton ke mutabik vahi mandir tode gaye jinamein vidrohiyon ko sharan milti thi yaa jinaki madad se badshaah ke khilaaf sajeesh rachi jaati thi
 At that time there was no religious purpose to break the temple
 is maamle main kukhyat kaha jane vaala aurangzeb bhi sultanate ke isi niyam par chalaa
 Examples of temple demolition during his reign are very rare and there are political reasons at his root
 udhaaharan ke liye aurangzeb ne dakshin bharat main kabhi-bhi mandiron ko nishaanaa nahin banaaya jabaki uske shasankaal main zyaadaatar sena yaheen tainaat thi
 He definitely attacked some temples in North India like Keshav Rai temple in Mathura but the reason was not religious
 mathura ke jaaton ne sultanate ke khilaaf vidroh kiya tha isliye yah hamalaa kiya gaya
 In contrast, Aurangzeb also patronized temples for reasons
 yah uski un hinduon ko bhent thi jo badshaah ke vafaadaar the
 Historian Catherine Butler of King's College, London even says that Aurangzeb had built more temples than he broke
 catherine frank, em athar ali or jilaluddin jaise vidwaan is taraf bhi ishaara karte hai ki aurangzeb ne kai hindu mandiron ko anudaan diya tha jinamein banaras kaa jangam baadi math, chitrakoot kaa balaji mandir, elahabaad kaa someshwar nath mahadev mandir or guwahati kaa umanand mandir sabase jane-pahachaane naam hai
 In the period in the Mughal period, the talk of breaking the temples is so much in vogue, there is no special mention of this in the Hindus
 tark diya ja saktaa he ki us daur main aisa karnaa khatre se khaali nahin rahaa hoga, lekin 18veen shatabdi main jab sultanate khatm ho gai tab bhi is baat kaa kahin zikr nahin miltaa
 In the past, the issue of the demolition of Hindu temples by Mughal rulers became hot in India in the 1980s-90s
 aurangzeb ko kattarpanthi sabit karne kii koshish main ek bada tark yah bhi diya jaataa he ki usne sangeet par pratibandh laga diya tha, lekin yah baat bhi sahi nahin he
 Catherine explains that music was not banned in her court even in the Sultanate
 badshaah ne jis din rajgaddi sanbhali thi, har saal us din utsav main khub naach-gaanaa hota tha
 Some Dhrupadas include the name Aurangzeb, which suggests that music was patronized during his reign
 kuch aitihaasik tathy is baat kii taraf bhi ishaara karte hai ki vah khud sangeet kaa acha jaankaar tha
 In mirat-e-alam, Bakhtawar Khan wrote that the emperor had knowledge like musical legends
 mughal vidwaan fakirullah ne raag darpan naam ke dastavej main aurangzeb ke pasandida gayakon or vaadakon ke naam darj kiye hai
 Aurangzeb was loved by his sons Azam Shah and history tells that Shah had become an accomplished musician during his father's lifetime
 aurangzeb ke shasankaal main sangeet ke phalne-phoolne kii baat karte hue catherine likhti hai, ‘500 saal ke puure mughalkaal kii tulana main aurangzeb ke samay farsi main sangeet par sabase zyada tikaa likhi gayi
 However, it is true that at the end of his life, Aurangzeb became more religious and kept away from song and music
 lekin upar hamane jin baton kaa zikr kiya he use dekhte hue yah mana ja saktaa he ki usne kabhi apni nijee ichha ko sultanate kii aadhikarik niti nahin banaaya
 In the late Aurangzeb, the Marathas had increased in strength in the south
 unhen dabaane main shahi sena ko safalataa nahin mil rahi thi
 Therefore, in 1683 Aurangzeb himself went south with the army
 vah rajdhani se dur rahata hua, apane shashan−kaal ke lagbhag antim 25 varsh tak usee abhiyaan main rahaa
 After ruling for 50 years, he died in Ahmednagar in the south on 3 March 1707 AD
 daulatabad main sthit fakir buruhanuddin kii qabr ke ahaate main use dafna diya gaya
 His policy created so many opponents, due to which the Mughal Empire itself came to an end

 a personality disorder is a class of different types of personality and behaviors that the American Psychiatric Association defines as follows, interneshnal statistical clacification of disease and related health problems, ne bhi vyaktitv vikaar ko paribhaashit kiya he
 Published by the World Health Organization
 vyaktitv vikaar ICD-10 Chapter V: Mental and behavioural disorders ke antargat vargeekrut kiye gaye hai, visheshkar maansik or vyavhaarik vikaron ke antargat: 28F60-F69
29 vayask vyaktitv or vyavhaar ke vikaar
 Ideally various forms of personality disorder are associated with serious problems in an individual's behavioral tendencies, which usually involve multiple aspects of personality and are almost always largely related to personal and social learning
 iske atirikt kai paristhitiyon main vyaktitv vikaar anamy or vyapak hota he, jo kaaphi had tak aise vyavhaar ke aatm-anurupata ke kaaran hota he or isliye vah vyakti ise uchit samajhataa he
 As a result of this type of behavior, the person concerned acquires a defective skill of discouraging concordance which can lead to personal problems that may cause the person concerned to suffer from excessive anxiety, restlessness and depression
 vyavhaar sambandhi in pravritiyon kii shuruyaat adarsh rup se kishoravastha ke baad ke charnon se vayaskta kii shuruuaat ke bich dekhi ja sakati he or kuch asaamaanya maamalon main yah bachapan main bhi dekhi ja sakati he
 Therefore, it is impossible to diagnose personality disorder before the age of 16 or 17
 nidaan sambandhi saamaanya nirdesh jo sabhi prakaar ke vyaktitv vikaron ke liye lagu hote hai, ve neeche die ja rahe hai, inke hetu poorak varnan prayek up prakaar ke saath die gaye hai
 Diagnosis of personality disorder can be quite subjective; However, inflexible and elaborate behavioral tendencies often lead to very serious personal and social problems as well as disrupting normal activities

 a study conducted on approximately 600 male college-going students, with an average age of about 30 years and not drawn from a clinical group, tested childhood sexual and physical abuse experiences and current personality disorder symptoms

 The severity of abuse was statistically significant but clinically insignificant, the prevalence of symptomatology extending to clusters A, b and c and modulus

 The following study attempted to compare Gatavaloki reports of abuse with the clinical community in cases that have evidenced psychopathology from childhood to adulthood in cases that have experienced abuse and neglect
 durvyavhaar ke shikaar hue samooh ne sarvaadhik pramanit dhang se or sadaiv psychopathology kii pravriti ke ucch str kaa pradarshan kiya
 It was observed that the experience of officially certified physical abuse played a strong role in the development of antisocial and impulsive behavior
 On the other hand, cases of abuse in the form of neglect that led to childhood pathology experienced partial loosening in adulthood

 unhone dekha ki vastav main adhikariyon main vikshubdh paraadhiyon kii tulana me 11 main se 3 prakaar ke vyaktitv vikaar bahut aam the
 The concept of personality disorder goes back at least to the time of the ancient Greeks
 neend apekshaakrit nilambit samvedi or sanchaalak gatividhi kii chetana kii ek prakritik baar-baar aanevaali roopantarit sthiti he, jo lagbhag sabhi svaichhik mansapeshiyon kii niskriyata kii visheshta liye hue hota he
 It is best kept awake state, when the ability to react to a stimulus or arousal is reduced and kept away from the unconscious, as it is easier to get out of sleep than a cold sleep or coma
 neend ek unnat nirmaan kriya vishyak sthiti he, jo vikaas par jor detii he or jo rogksham tantra, tantrika tantra, kankaleey or mansapeshi pranali main nayi jaan daal detii he
 It is followed in all mammals, in all birds and in many reptiles, amphibians and fish
 neend ke uddeshy or prakriya sirf aanshik rup se hi spasht hai or ye gahan shodh ke vishay hai
 In mammals and birds, sleep is divided into two main parts: fast eye movements and non-fast eye movements
 Each type is associated with a different set of physical, neurological and psychological characteristics
 american academy of sleep medicine ne NREM ko or bhi teen staron main vibhajit kiya he: N1, N2 or N3
 antim str ko delta sleep yaa slo-wave sleep bhi kehete hai
 Sleep proceeds in the cycle of REM and NREM, the sequence being normally N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM
 raat main aarambh main bahut adhik gahari neend hua karti he, jabaki raat main baad main or prakritik jaagran se thik pehle REM neend kaa anupaat bad jaataa he
 The stages of sleep were first described by Alfred Lee Loomis and his colleagues in 1937; Who divided the various electroencephalography characteristics of sleep into five levels, which represent the order from waking to deep sleep
 1953 main, REM nidra ke bhinn rup kii khoj kii gayi or is prakaar wiliam dement or nathanial clitman ne nidra ko NREM charnon tathaa REM main punarvargeekrut kiya
 In 1968, in "R&K Sleep Scoring Manual" Alan Rechtschaffen and Anthony Kales standardized the criteria for stages
 aar and ke maanak main, NREM nidra ko chaar charnon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha, dhimi-tarangon kii nidra charnon ko charan 3 or 4 rakhaa gaya
 In Phase 3, delta waves are less than 50% of the total wave pattern, while in Phase 4 they exceed 50%
 iske alaava, REM nidra kaa ullekh kabhi-kabhi charan 5 ke rup main kiya jaataa tha
 In 2004, AASM appointed the AASM Visual Scoring Task Force to review the R&K scoring system
 samiksha se kai badlaav kiye gayi, inamen sabase mahatvapurn rahaa charan 3 or charan 4 kaa charan N3 main sangyojan
 2007 main sanshodhit scoring da AASM minial for scoring of sleep and associated events ke rup main prakashit hua
 Stimulus and breathing, cardiovascular and motion episodes were also added
 visheshikrut nidra prayogshaala main polisomnography dwaara neend ke charan tathaa neend kii anya visheshtaon kaa aam taur par moolyankan kiya jaataa he
 Measurements taken include EEG of brain waves, electroculography of eye movements and electromyography of skeletal muscle activity
 manushyon main, prayek nidra chakra ausat 90 se 110 minute tak ke liye rahata he, or prayek charan ke alag-alag shaareerik kaary ho sakate hai
 This may cause sleepiness and may cause unconsciousness, but it does not complete physical work
 2007 ke eeesem maanakon ke anusaar, enariem teen charnon ke hote hai
 NREM has relatively few dreams
 charan N1 mastishk ke sankraman se sambandhit he, is charan main mastishk 8 se 13 hertz kii frequency ke alpha tarangon se 4 se 7 hertz frequency kii theta tarangon main sankraman karata he
 This phase is sometimes referred to as drowsiness or sound sleep
 achaanak jhatka aana or neend ke ubharne ko sakaaratmak myochlonus ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, jo N1 ke dauraan neend ke aarambh ke saath judaa ho saktaa he
 Some people may also have hypnotic hallucinations during this phase, which can be troublesome for them
 N1 ke dauraan, vyakti kuch mansapeshi dasha or bahari vaataavaran kii sabase adhik sachet jaagrukta ganvaa detaa he
 The characteristic of phase N2 is that during this time the sleep spindle rotates between 11 and 16 Hz and K-complexes
 is charan ke dauraan, jaisaa ki EMG dwaara mapa gaya, mansapeshiyon kii gatividhi kam ho jaati he or bahari vaataavaran ke prati sachet jaagrukta gaayab ho jaati he
 In adults, this stage occurs in 45% to 55% of total sleep
 stage N3 kaa charitra chithran is tarah kiya jaataa he ki is dauraan delta tarangon kaa kam se kam 20% 0
5 se 2 hertz ke bich hon or chotii-se-chotii aayam >75 μv kaa ho
 Parasomnians like night terror, night bed, walking in sleep and sleep disturbances occur in this phase
 kai drushtaant or vivaran abhi bhi 20% -50% delta tarangon ke saath N3 charan or 50% se adhik delta tarangon ke saath N4 ko darshaate hai; ye sanyukt rup se charan N3 hai
 Fast eye movement sleep, or REM sleep, accounts for 20% –25% of the total sleep of most human adults
 aariem nidra ke liye mandandon main tej netra gati or ek drut kam-voltage iiji shaamil he
 The most memorable dreams come at this stage
 kam se kam stanadhariyon main, ek avarohi mansapeshi tanaav dekha gaya he
 This type of paralysis may be necessary to protect the anatomy from self-harm, which may occur through physical activity from the living dreams often encountered during this phase
 neend kaa samay sirkadian ghadi, sleep-vek homeostasis dwaara niyantrit he or manushyon main, kuch seemaa ke andar, ichhashakti vyavhaar par nirbhar he
 The circadian clock — an internal timekeeping, temperature-instability, enzyme-controlling device — works in tandem with adenosine, a neurotransmitter that disrupts many physiological processes associated with wakefulness
 adenosine din bhar main taiyaar hota he; adenosine ke ucch str se tandra aati he
 In diurnal animals, sleepiness or drowsiness comes from the circadian element due to the release of the hormone melatonin and the gradual decrease in the body's internal temperature
 kisiike kronotip dwaara samay prabhavit hota he
 Circadian rotation determines the ideal timing of a properly structured and healthy sleeping episode
 homeostatic nidra kii sahajpravriti kaa santoshprad neend ke liye sirkadian tatv ke saath santulit hona jaruri he
 Along with the message received from the circadian clock, it tells the body that it needs sleep
 sirkadian aavartan se neend se jagane kaa mukhya rup se nirdhaaran hota he
 a person who regularly wakes up early, usually cannot sleep longer than his normal time, even if he has slept less
 neend kii avadhi DEC2 jin dwaara prabhavit he
 Some people have mutations of this gene; They sleep two hours less than normal
 tantrika sambandhi vigyaan kii professor ying-hui phu or unke sahyogiyon ne DEC2 utparivartan liye chuhon kii nasl paidaa kii, jo aam chuhon kii tulana main kam soya karte
 The optimal amount of sleep cannot be a meaningful concept unless sleep or timing are seen in association with a person's circadian rotation
 a person's major sleep episode can be relatively fruitless and insufficient if it occurs at the "wrong" time of day; One should sleep for at least six hours before the body temperature is low
 sahi timming wo he jab neend ke madhya prakaran ke baad or jagane se pehle nimnlikhit do chihnak yaa marker prakat ho jaaen: Human sleep can vary by age and between individuals, and sleep is considered adequate if there is no drowsiness or dysfunction during the day
 vishvavidhyalay california, saan diego ke das lakh vayaskon ke ek manacchikitsa adhyayan main paaya gaya ki jo log sabase adhik samay tak jivit hai ve raat main chah se saat ghante roj swayan prerit hokar soya karte hai
 Another study on the risk of sleep duration and mortality in women found a similar result
 anya adhyayanon se pataa chalata he ki "pratidin 7 se 8 ghante se adhik neend lene waalon main badhi hui mrityu dar lagaataar judy hui he", haalanki is adhyayan kaa yah bhi kahana he ki iskaa kaaran avsaad or samajok-aarthik sthiti ho sakati he, jo aankadon kii drushti se sah-sambandhit ho jate hai
 It has also been said that compared to those who wake up on an alarm, those who naturally wake up after less sleep only show a correlation between fewer sleep hours and less morbidity
 varavik vishvavidhyalay or vishvavidhyalay college landan ke shodhakartaaon ne paaya ki neend kii kami hryday rog se mrityu ke khatre ko dugune se adhik badha detii he, lekin bahut adhik neend bhi mrityu ke khatre ko duguna karne ke saath judi ho sakati he, haalanki mukhya rup se hryday rog se nahin
 Professor Francisco Capuccio stated, "short sleep has been seen to be a risk factor for weight gain, hypertension and type 2 diabetes, and sometimes death; but long sleep leads to increased death as opposed to short sleep-mortality
 There is no possible mechanism to link the rate, it is yet to be investigated
 kuch log isamen shaamil hai lekin iske liye avsaad, nimna saamaajik-aarthik sthiti or cancer-sambandhit clanti isaki vajah rahe


 rokthaam ke sandarbh main, hamaare nishkarshon se pataa chalata he ki lagaataar prati raat saat ghante ke aasapaas sona swasthya ke liye ishtatam yaa sarvottam he or neend main nirantar kami biimaar swasthya ke liye pehle se pravrutt hona ho saktaa he
 " iske alaava, neend kii kathinaaiyaan ghanishtha rup se avsaad, madyapata or dwidhruvi vikaar jaise manorog vikaron se judy hai
 Sleep difficulties have been found in up to 90% of adults with depression
 iiji main paae gayi animyan main neend kii nirantarata main vighn, delta neend main kami or prasupti ke sambandh sahit badalte REM pattern, raat bhar kaa vibhaajan tathaa netra gati kaa ghanatv shaamil hai
 Children need more sleep per day in order to develop and function properly: up to 18 hours for a newborn, then decrease as they age
 ek navjaat shishu rojaanaa lagbhag 9 ghante kii REM neend liya karata he
 By the age of five or above, REM sleeps for just over two hours 
 paryaapt aaraam or neend nahin lene kaa asar he neend kaa karj; aise bade karj maansik, bhaavnaatmak or shaareerik thakaan kaa kaaran banate hai
 Sleep debt results in loss of ability to perform high level cognitive functions
 neurophysiological or kaaryaatmak imaging adhyayanon ne dikhaaya he ki mastishk ke saamne ke kshetra vishesh rup se homeostatic neend dabaav ke liye pratikriyasheel hai
 Scientists do not agree on how much sleep debt is possible; Does it accumulate according to a person's average sleep or is there some other criterion; Nor has there been any significant change in the prevalence of sleep debt among adults in the industrialized world in recent decades
 yah zarur hua he ki pehle kii tulana main pashchimi samaajon ke bachche kam so rahe hai
 It is suspected that when and for how long a person needs sleep, such as a greater magnitude of sleep-related behavior, is regulated by our genetics
 shodhakartaaon ne kuch saboot kii khoj kii he jisase is dharna ko samarthan miltaa hua lagata he
 Many theories about the function of sleep have proposed their own explanations, but it appears that understanding about the subject is currently incomplete
 aisa sambhav he ki kuch moulik kaary ko puraa karne ke liye neend kaa vikaas hua or samay ke saath isane kai kaam apana liya
 The issue was raised that if sleep was not necessary, one would be expected to know: aaj tak koi bhi pashu aisa nahin mila he jo in mandandon ko puraa kar sake
 Among the many proposed functions of sleep are the following
 neend dwaara ghaav bharne main sahaayta milte dekha gaya he
 In 2004 Gumustekin et al
 a study conducted by the study showed that lack of sleep hindered the healing of mice's burns
 yah paaya gaya he ki neend kii kshati rogksham pranali ko prabhavit karti he
 In 2007, Jäger et al
 In a study conducted by, mice were deprived of sleep for 24 hours

 It is now possible to be said that "sleep damage attenuates immune function and presents a challenge to immunological sleep manipulation," and it has been reported that mammalian animals that spend their long sleeps in the immune system Invest, because species that have long sleeps have more white blood cells
 yah pramanit hona abhi baaki he ki neend kii avadhi daihik vikaas ko prabhavit karti he
 In 2007 Jenny et al
 In a study by 305 children growth, height and weight were recorded, this was done in correlation with their parents, parents were informed of the bedtime of the children and the study lasted for nine years
 
 It was found that "changes in sleep duration in children do not seem to have an effect on their development
" " yah dekha gaya ki neend-or adhik vishesh rup se dhimi gati kii neend - vayask purushon ke hormone staron kii vruddhi ko prabhavit karti he
 During an eight-hour sleep, Van Couture, Leproult, and Platt found that those with a higher percentage of SWS also had a higher growth of hormone secretion, while those with a lower percentage of SWS had a lower growth of hormones
 neend ke swasthyakaari kaary ke paksh main anek tark he
 The metabolic phase during sleep is surgeon action; Surgeons such as growth hormones are secreted preferentially such as action hormones during sleep
 saamanytah, prajatiyon main neend kii avadhi, jaanavar ke aakaar se vipareet dhang se sambandhit he or sidhe-sidhe aadhariya chayapachay dar se judi hui he
 Rats with a very high basal metabolic rate sleep up to 14 hours daily, while elephants and giraffes sleep only 3-4 hours with low basal metabolic rates
 vaataavaran se andrik rachana ko band kiye bina shanti se aaraam karne ke jariye urja sangrakshan sampann kiya ja saktaa he, jo sambhawatah ek khatarnaak sthiti he
 a dull-sleeping animal is more likely to survive predators, while still conserving energy
 so, neend, urja sangrakshan karne ke alaava anya uddeshy yaa uddeshyon ko puraa karti lagati he; udhaaharan ke liye, suptavastha vaale pashu sheetanidra se jagane ke baad suptavastha kii avadhi ke dauraan neend puri nahin hone ke kaaran phir se neend main chale jate hai
 They are definitely well rested and have conserved energy during hibernation, but for some other reason they need to sleep
 jin chuhon ko anischitkaal tak jagaaye rakhaa jaataa he, unamem twachaa ke jakhm, hikeraphegia, sharir pind kaa nuksaan, alpataap or antat, ghaatak septicemia kaa vikaas hota he
 According to the ontogenetic hypothesis of REM sleep, newborn-related activity during REM sleep is particularly important for body development
 sakriy neend ke abhaav ke prabhaavon par kiye gayi adhyayanon se pataa chalaa ki jivan ke armbh main is abhaav se vyavhaar kii samasyaayein, sthaayee neend vighn, mastishk pind main kami or ek asaamaanya pariman main neuron koshikaon kii mrityu kii samasyaayein paidaa hoti hai
 REM sleep appears to be important for brain development
 shishuon kii neend ke adhikansh bhaag par REM neend kaa hi kabja hota he, shishu apana adhik samay neend main hi guzaara karte hai
 In various species, the more immature the baby is born, the more time it spends in REM sleep
 prastaavkon kaa yah bhi kahana he ki mastishk sakriyan kii upasthiti main rem-prerit mansapeshi avarodhan se chetopagam ko sakriy karne ke jariye mastishk vikaas main madad milti he, tathaapi kisi sanchaalak parinaam ke bagaiyr isse shishu mushkil main pad saktaa he
 Additionally, REM sleep deprivation leads to developmental abnormalities later in life
 baharhaal, isaki vyakhya nahin kii gayi he ki praudh vayaskon ko tab bhi kyon REM neend kii jarurat padati he
 Aquatic mammal infants do not sleep REM in infancy; REM sleep in such animals increases with aging
 vaigyanikon ne aise anek tareeke bataaye hai jinamein neend ko smriti se sambandhit dikhaaya gaya he
 a study by Turner, Drummond, Salamat, and Brown showed that sleep deprivation affected working memory
 karyrat smriti mahatvapurn he kyonki yah nirnay lene, tark-vitark karne or praasangik smriti jaise ucch stareey sangyanatmak kaaryon ke adhik prakraman or madad ke liye soochnaaon ko sakriy rakhata he
 The study allowed 18 women and 22 men to sleep only 26 minutes per night over a period of four days
 in vyaktiyon ne puure aaraam ke baad shuruyaat main sangyanatmak pareekshan die or phir chaar dinon main neend ke abhaav ke dauraan din main do baar pareekshan kiye gayi
 In the final test, the average working memory expansion of this sleep-deprived group was found to be 38% lower than the controlled group
 REM or dhimi gati kii neend jaise neend ke kuch charnon dwaara smriti alag tarah se prabhavit hoti jaan padati he
 In a study cited in Born, Rasch and Gess, several human subjects were used: awakening controlled groups and sleep testing groups
 The sleep and wake groups were taught a task and then tested in both the nighttime and late night time, in order to balance the order in all participants
 jab neend ke dauraan un pratibhaagiyon ke mastishk ko scan kiya gaya to hypnogram ne paaya ki raat ke aarambh main neend kaa charan SWS haaavee rahata he, jo neend charan gatividhi kaa ausatan 23% ke aasapaas kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Compared to the controlled group, the early-night test group performed 16% better on the declarative memory test
 der-raatri neend ke dauraan, lagbhag 24% ke saath REM sabase sakriy neend kaa charan ban gaya or niyantrit samooh kii tulana main prakriyaatmak smriti pareekshan main der-raatri pareekshan samooh ne 25% behatar pradarshan kiya
 This suggests that late-night rem-rich sleep benefits procedural memory, while early-night sws-rich sleep benefits declarative memory
 datta dwaara kiye gaye ek adhyayan main in parinaamon kaa paroksh rup se samarthan kiya gaya he
 22 male mice were made eligible for the study
 ek aise dibbe kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha jisamen ek chuha maje se ek chor se duusare chor tak aa-ja sake
 The bottom of the box was made of steel mesh
 ek dhwani ke saath dibbe main ek roshni chamakati
 paanch second baad, bijli kaa jhatka lagaaya jaataa
 jhatka shuru hote hi chuha dibbe ke duusare chor par chalaa jaataa, tab jhatka turant hi samaapt ho jaataa
 chuuhe bhi paanch second deree kaa upyog karke dibbe ke duusare chor ja sakate the or is tarah jatke se puri tarah batch sakate the
 The duration of the shock never exceeded five seconds
 aadhe chuhon par ise 30 baar duharaaya gaya
 The other half, the control group, were placed on the same trial, but the mice were jerked regardless of their response
 prayek prashikshan satr ke baad, chuuhe ko poligraphic recording ke liye chah ghante tak ek recording pinjre main rakhaa jaataa
 yah prakriya lagaataar teen dinon tak duhraayi gayi
 This study found that during post-sleep recording sessions of sleep testing, mice spent 25
47% more time in REM sleep after exercise trials, compared to after control trials
 These tests were conducted by Born et al
 The study results support a clear indication of the correlation between REM sleep and procedural knowledge
 datta adhyayan kaa ek avlokan yah he ki pareekshan ke baad recording satr ke dauraan niyantran samooh kii tulana main neend abhyaas samooh ne SWS main 180% adhik samay bitaayaa
 is tathy ko kudrimoti, burns or mecnuton dwaara kiye gayi ek adhyayan se samarthan mila
 This study suggests that after spatial search activity, the pattern of hippocampal cells in the experiment is reactivated during SWS
 kudrimoti at al
 ke ek adhyayan main, kisi chor main inaam kaa upyog karke saat chuhon ko ek rekhiy trek main daudaya gaya
 Rats were allowed 30 minutes to adapt to the track, then ran for 30 minutes in the track for reward-based training, and then allowed to rest for 30 minutes
 in teen prayek avadhiyon ke dauraan, chuhon kii neend ke charnon kii soochna ke lieiji data ekatra kiye gayi
 Kudrimoti et al
 Calculated the mean firing rates of the cells of the hippocampal during the pre-behavior of the SWS and the average of 22 track-times of seven mice, with a ten-minute break placed three times in response to the SWS
 nattejey bataate hai ki pareekshan daud satr ke baad ke das minute main purv str kii tulana main hippocample kii koshikaon kii min firing rate main 12% kii vruddhi dekhi gayi; haalanki 20 minute ke baad, min firing rate teji se purv str par waapas laut gayi
 The increase in firing of hippocampal cells during SWS after spatial exploration may explain why SWS sleep levels were increased in Datta's study, as it was also associated with a form of spatial exploration
 SWS ke dauraan dhime dolan ke pariman ko badhaane ke liye puromukhy valkal main ekadish dhara uttejan ko shaamil karte hue ek adhyayan hua 
 Directional current stimulation greatly increased word-pair recall the next day, providing evidence that SWS plays a large role in the consolidation of relevant memories
 vibhinn adhyayanon kaa yah kahana hai ki neend or smriti ke jatil kaaryon ke bich ek sah-sambandh he
 Harvard sleep researchers Saper and Stickgold state that an essential part of memory and practice consists of nerve cell pulmonary, which sends information to the cell body to be organized into new neuronal connections
 is prakriya kii maang he ki koi bahari jaankaree in drumashmon ko prastut nahin kii jaay or yah bhi kaha gaya ki sambhawatah isiilie neend ke samay smritiyaan or gyaan thos or vyavasthit hoti hai
 The principle of "preservation and preservation" holds that sleep functions adaptively
 din ke 24 ghanton ke un bhaagon main jab praani kii raksha karata he, jab vah jagaa hota he or isiilie aasapaas ghumta rahata he or jab vyakti bade jokhim main hota he
 The organism does not need 24 hours to feed and it meets other needs
 anukulan ke is drushtikon se, jeev nuksaan ke raste se dur rahete hai, jahaan ve anya sambhavit majboot jeevon kaa shikaar ban sakate hai
 They sleep at the same time which maximizes their safety, providing them physical ability and their accommodation
 
 However, this theory fails to explain why the brain breaks down with the external environment during normal sleep
 is siddhant ke khilaaf ek or tark he ki neend mahaj vaataavaran se pashuon ko alag karne kaa ek niskriy parinaam nahin he, balki ek "drive" he;neend lene ke kram main pashu apane vyavhaar main tabdili let he
 Therefore, circadian regulation is more than sufficient to explain the duration of activity and inactivity, which is adaptable to the organism, but even more peculiar peculiarities of sleep possibly serve other and unknown functions
 iske alaava, parirakshan siddhant ko yah vyakhya karne kii jarurat he ki singh jaise maansaahaari, jo khaadya shrinkhalaa main sabase upar hai or jinhen adhik bhay bhi nahin he, kyon bahut adhik soya karte hai
 It has been said that they need to reduce energy degradation when they are not on the hunt
 parirakshan siddhant isaki bhi vyakhya nahin karata he ki jaleey stanpayi chalate hue kyon soya karte hai
 Inactivity during these sensitive hours does the same and becomes more beneficial, as the creature is still able to meet environmental challenges like predators etc
 nidrahin raat ke doshapurn anukulan ke baad neend phir se palat kar aati he, lekin spasht rup se kisi kaaran se hi aati he
 At the time of his sleep, a zebra, which is trying to save its life from a lion, falls asleep during the day, which is no more vulnerable than being a victim

 Dreaming is stimulated by pons and dreams occur mostly during the REM phase of sleep
 sapane ke kaary ke bare main logon ne anek avadharanaen pesh kii hai
 Sigmund Freud unquestionably believed that dreams are the expression of imperfect desires that are put or thrown into the unconscious mind and he used dream interpretation as psychoanalysis to discover these desires
 dekhen frid: da interpritesan of drims Freud's work deals with the psychological role of dreams, which clearly does not exclude any physical role that may be possible
 It is therefore not ruled out by the increasing modern interest in the organization and consolidation of recent memory and experience
 haal ke shodh kaa daawa he ki abhyaas or anubhav ke dauraan chetopagam samparkon ke samekan or vyavasthaapan kii samgr bhoomika neend kii he
 The activation synthesis theory of John Allen Hobson and Robert mccarley states that dreams are caused by the indiscriminate firing of neurons in the brain vulva during the REM period

 bahut saare khanaabadosh yaa shikari-faramar samaajon main log puure din yaa raat bhar sote-jagate rahete hai, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki kab kya kuch ho rahaa he
 Artificial illumination began to be available on a large scale in industrialized Western countries since at least the mid-19th century and the introduction of lighting led to a significant change in sleep patterns everywhere
 saamaanya taur par, log raat ke samay sone jane ke bahut baad atyant gahari neend main hote hai, haalanki hameshaa aisa sach nahin hota he
 In some societies, people usually sleep with at least one other person or with animals
 kuch anya samskritiyon main, log sabase antarang parijan jaise ki pati-patni ko chhodkar virale hi kisi ke saath sote hai
 In almost all societies, the sleeping partner is controlled by social rules

 Many mammals sleep for a long time-to-long ratio every 24 hours
 haalanki, kiler whale kuch dolphin apane jivan ke pehle maheene ke dauraan nahin soti hai
 These differences can be interpreted in such a way that newborn mammals are protected by their parents when they sleep, whereas marine organisms need to be constantly alert to their predators, even at the young age
