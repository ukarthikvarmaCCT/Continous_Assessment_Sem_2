 ghasiram kotwaal vijay tendulkar dwaara likhit marathi naatak he
 This is the story of the tragedy of Ghasiram, a Hindi-speaking Brahmin who went to Poona, a stronghold of Brahmins in search of employment
 brahmanon se apamaanit ghasiram maratha peshwa naanaa fadanbis se apni beti ke vivaah kaa sauda karata he or puna kii kotwali hasil kar un brahmanon se badla letaa he
 But Nana kills his daughter
 ghasiram chaahakar bhi iskaa badla nahin le paata
 On the contrary, Nana kills him
 is naatak ke mul marathi swaroop kaa pehali baar pradarshan 16 disambar, 1972 ko puna main ‘progressive dramatik association’ dwaara bharat natya mandir main hua
 The director was Dr
 Jabbar Patel
 ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ aitihaasik naatak nahin he
 It is a drama, only a drama! a drama is only a drama
 ek saahitiyik kalakriti ke sandarbh main yah kahana ki vah aitihaasik he, yaa puranic he, yaa saamaajik he, bemaani he
 Time too quickly turns social into historical and historical to mythological
 phir bhi is naatak kii saamagree-kaccha masala-itihaas se batori gai he
 a weak basis of history is definitely taken
 par, iske aage naatak kaa itihaas se koi sambandh nahin he
 And this raw spice is also taken from history in the same way as it is taken from contemporary life-situations
 maharashtra main peshwaon kaa raaj tha, naanaa fadanvis peshwa ke pradhan the, koi ek ghasiram tha, brahman the, maratha sardaar the or ve sab ikaiyaan apane-apane daayre main bandhi samay ke pravaah main lakdi ke latthe kii bhanti kabhi satakar to kabhi hatakar, kabhi paraspar ko chooti to kabhi takaraati apratihat pravaahit ho rahi thim
 It may be the job of a person who researches history, not the playwright, to investigate whether his work was appropriate or improper or his basic existence was meaningful
 main isi kaaran ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ ko anaitihaasik naatak maanata hoon
 'ghasiram Kotwal' is a legend, a legend, a legend
 or dantakatha kaa ek apana rachana-vidhaan hota he: jhine yatharth ko jab ham apni naitikta se ranjit kar kalpana kii sahaayta se punarujjivit karte hai to ek dantakatha ban jaati he
 There is also a story of gossip and if there is a sight to behold then it is a dahik experience daahak anubhav hi rachanaatmak sahitya ban paata he, isamen koi sandeh nahin he
 But what is a legend and how is it, what matters more is how we take it, because then we do our investigation
 jaahir he ki yahi kaam sabase mushkil hota he, ek gahari chunauti he vah
 To accept it is to show our literature-loyalty
 meri nigaah main ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ ek vishisht samaaj-sthiti kii ore sanket karata he
 That social condition is neither old nor new
 na vah kisi bhugolic seemaa-rekha main bandhi he, na samay se hi
 That place is timeless, so 'ghasiram' and 'nana Phadnavis' are also place-timeless
 samaaj-sthitiyaan unhen janm detii hai, detii rahengi
 The playwright of any era will not be able to remain untouched by them
 apni prakruti ke anusaar vah kabhi bhavy-bheeshan rup dekar unhen manch par utaaregaa to kabhi nrity-sangitamay banaakar prastut karegaa
 i have deliberately adopted another method
 lokanaty kaa lacheelaapan vikhyath he or dantakatha ke prastutikaran ke liye sabase adhik upyogi he
 In it, a character emerges as a representative of a specific mindset and that attitude is very direct and complete and unmatched
 satahi sanshlishtataa ke rahete hue bhi vah aam darshak ke saamne baraabar ujagar hokar rahati he
 Apart from this, he also has his own devotion, which incarnates itself at the level of language and spectacle
 lokanaty kii is vishistataa ko main kyon chhod detaa ? But the creator should not speak much about his creation, the composition speaks for itself and the same is true
 vijay tendulkar In this play, Tendulkar has portrayed the social and political situation of the erstwhile social and political situation in his own specific style along with this struggle, despite Ghasiram and Nana Fadnavis being the main people-struggle
 parinamat: sattadhari varg or jansadharan kii sampoorn sthiti par kaal-avasthaapan ke antar se vishesh vaastavik antar nahin padataa
 Ghasiram is in every age and society, and in that period and in that society, there is a chance to make him like that and to kill him as well as Nana Phadnavis - that is what Tendulkar has proposed in his own way
 naanaa ne ghasiram kaa upyog badi dhoortta se kiya he
 But when their 'demon' is created and starts to challenge them, the maternal grandfather also destroys him
 is drushti se yah naatak naanaa fadanvis kaa hi he, isamen shaq nahin
 Ghasiram is, in a way, a mere matter which Tendulkar has made, a means for the expression of his statement
 ‘ghasiram kotwaal’ naatak main naanaa fadanvis or tatkaaleen patanonmukh samaaj ke chithran dwaara kuch raajnneetik or vishesh saamaajik sthitiyon ke vishay main tendulkar ko kuch satya ujagar karne hai, jo sanathan ho gaye hai
 Nana Fadnavis of history is reputed to be a power tormented by intellectual brilliance
 kintu is naatak main keval ghasiram kotwaal ke prasang kii seemaa main ghire hone ke kaaran unka vyaktitv ikharaa dikhaai padataa he, uske duusare aayam saamne nahin aate
 Indirectly, Tendulkar has used it in the same way as in folk plays where characters are usually of one or two dimensions
 isiilie ek prasiddh marathi sameekshak ne is naatak ko bahut kuch parmparik bhartiya natya-rup uparupak jaisaa bataaya he
 i have considered this same thing in my presentation as the central formula
 naatak dekhte samay darshakon ke man main anjaane hi yah baat utarati jaani chahie ki saare-kaa-sara samaaj hi dhah rahaa he, chuk rahaa he
 This conversation should not be indirect
 is naatak kii rachana marathi rangamanch ke liye ekadam nai hone ke kaaran uske abhipret arth ko manachaahi apratyaksh paddati se vyakt karne main mujhe badi suvidha hui
 No reputed playwright had previously molded a play in the form of folklore, so i was able to use the flexible elastic craft of Loknataka in many ways
 aadamiyon ke jhulate parade kii kalpana rangamanch ke liye adbhut he
 This is also the biggest tip of this drama
 baarah brahman kores ke rup main katha-pravaah sanbhaalate hai
 They also play immediate single roles as required
 yah paradaa do khandon main bantataa he or kshan-bhar main samaaj ke kai-kai ghatakon, icaayiyon ke praturup main dhal jaataa he
 The same curtain, which establishes Ghasiram as Kotwal, is seen in the theater as angry Brahmins during the slaughter of Ghasiram
 shri gajraj nartan karain gaanevaala yahi paradaa ganpati-vandana dwaara lokanaty se apana sambandh jodta he
 a subtle and level relationship between the artist and the role is characteristic of Loknatya
 maine apane pradarshan ko kisi vishesh lokastyle main nahin bandha varan dashavathar, bharud, khelaa, tamaasha, powada, vaadhyamurali, kirthan aadi shuddh marathi lokkalaon kaa mishrit upyog kiya he
 Dasavatari starts by Saraswati, Lakshmi, Ganapati
 is samay kii aarti ke thaal ko hi baad main kirthan ke samay kaale tike ke liye upyog kar in vibhinn shaileyon main samya dikhaane kaa maine praytn kiya he
 Brahmin-dressed artists come to the theater through the auditorium
 is prakaar atmiyata utpann hone ke kaaran pradarshan kaa lokanaty-rup darshakon ke maansik str tak adhikadhik sampreshit ho jaataa he
 The pace of the first issue of the play is slower than the second
 lok natya ke bahya swaroop main aitihaasik vyakti ko sthapit hone main samay laganaa swaabhaavik hi he kyonki vah sarvatha nayaa anubhav he
 History-men like Nana Phadnavis coming to the theater dancing-rhythmic was definitely a shocking experience for the Marathi audience
 isliye darshak ko is baat kaa vishwaas dilaanaa tha ki is naatak kaa paatr naanaa fadanvis ek loknatakeey charitra maatr he-aitihaasik naatakon kaa pramanik, sampoorn vyaktitv nahin
 In the view of some reviewers, this was established very slowly
 kintu mujhe laga ki khokhale samaaj ko nirdeshit kar usamen naanaa ke sthaan or kotwali hasil karne ke liye ghasiram dwaara naanaa ke upyog kii prakriya aadi kaa digdarshan vistaarpurn hona hi chahie tha
 The pace of the second digit was fast
 puna ke brahmanon par atyaachaar karanevaala ghasiram, uskaa pratishodh, us pratishodh ke kaaran ghasiram kaa rakshas main roopaantarit hona, aadi agnipariksha ke drishy tak jaakar sthapit hota he
 From Nana's marriage to Gauri's death Ghasiram is very restless but his restlessness is that of Naradham
 vah brahmanon ko kothri main ghont kar maarna nahin chahta tha lekin naradham ghasiram kii hatya uske apratyaksh aparaadh kaa hi fal he-niyati ke is virodhabhas ko tendulkar ne prabhaavshaalee dhang se nirupit kiya he
 Such a vengeance of destiny is found in the context of many historical villains
 ghasiram kii hatya ke baad naanaa kaa chaturaai-bharaa bhaashan dhurttata or kootneeti se purna hone ke kaaran unke prabhutv kaa vilakshan prabhaav utpann karata he or naanaa fadanvis pun: naatak ke kendra main aa jate hai
 The English character of this drama is a mere spectator
 naatak ke ant main vah pichhali chaowkee par bain ore prakashvritt main khadaa he
 The mass celebration is taking place after the murder of Ghasiram below
 yah puna ke bhavi itihaas kaa mahatvapurn purvabhaas he
 The same British, standing at the corner of Ghasiram's Kotwali ceremony, becomes a witness to it
 maine pehali baar jab yah naatak padhaa to laga yah naatak samvaad-pradhan nahin, apekshaakrit drishy-pradhan he
 i was looking for a play that produced visual effects like this
 duusari baat bahut dinon se mere man main yah thi ki filmon main doorvarti madhyavarti or sameepvarti chitron kii teen-chaar duriyon or unke sammishran ke shilp or chaaturya se jo vishesh prabhaav utpann kiya jaataa he, vah rangamanch par bhi kyon na ho ? yah naatak samvaad, nrity, sangeet, gati, paatr, drishy aadi anek khandon ke yoga se agrasar hota he
 The formula that connects them is also tremendous
 in sab tattvon ke saath hi yah naatak ‘purna’ lagata he, atev kaalpanik camera haath main lekar hi maine ise saakaar karne kaa praytn kiya
 Dividing the theater by light-planning produced many desired effects on the theater far and near
 gati or samoohan aadi ko maine kagaji taiyaari main hi nirdhaarit kar liya tha
 In my method, the sketches of the theme are already prepared on every page of the performance copy of the play
 is naatak ke saath-pansth paatro kii gatiyaan swat:sfoort na hon varan niojit rahen, iske liye main puri tarah taiyaar tha
 The pace-style of these characters was expected to be like puppets
 charitra kii drushti se maine jo ghasiram chunaa, vah kad main chota tha
 He must have been a dwarf among the 'ragged' people around
 nrity-gatiyaan saral or sahaj kintu layaaddh thim
 The use of classical dance seemed complex and sophisticated in this folk dance
 nrity-gatiyon main lokanaty kii angadh urja kaa hona aavashyak tha
 The mere death of Ghasiram's dance was presented in a spontaneous manner
 dhol or nagaade kii prabal taal ko chandaavarkarji1 ne aage jaakar vishesh dhang se badhaayaa, jisase drishy kii bheeshanta badi
 Nana's dance movements continued with restraint and dominance
 mulagandji2 ne laavni ko baithki laavni ke padanyas main dhaala tha jo puure marathi rangavaali thi

 Bhaskar Chandavarkar ji took only leather instruments for the music and he also played along with the performance, not recording it in advance
 usamen apwaad maatr sundari vaadya hi tha
 Sundari was played differently in the nana-gauri garden scene and at the time of Nana's marriage
 chandaavarkarji organ nahin chaahate the kyonki usase prachlit sangeet naatakon kaa sa asar lok-sangeet main aa jaataa
 Naman, Lavani, Powada, Wadhyamurali, Bharuad etc
 were sung along with their natural nature
 gunagunaane kaa upyog marathi rangamanch par pehali baar chandaavarkarji ne kiya
 Different emotions were expressed by the humming of the moving screen of humans
 ghasiram kii hatya ke baad utsav hota he or phir manushyon kaa paradaa saamne aata he
 The story has ended, so the actor who plays Nana also joins this screen
 ghasiram mara padaa he, par us abhinayta ke uthne se rasbhang na ho, isliye use apvaadrup yathasthaan hi rahane diya jaataa he
 Only then does the narrator go ahead and pay homage to that 'artist' by singing Shri Gajraj Nartan, Dhrupad in the compassionate voice of Bhairavi
 ek prakaar se lokanataka kaa purna shilp yahan dikhta he or naanaa jaise sattadhari vyakti kaa pankti main aana bhi vishesh arth kaa dyotak ho jaataa he, kyonki jaise pehle bataaya gaya, angrej peeche khadaa yah sab dekh rahaa he
 But this form of drama, more than the folklore craft, makes one think deeper
 ghasiram darshakon se sidhe baat karata he, prabhaav ko gahan karne ke liye jo ki brekht ke vipareet he, kyonki yahan ghasiram katha-sutara main baadha nahin daalata, na hi vah prabhaav ko mitaane kaa ytn karata he
 It is here that Tendulkar has used a different craft than orthodox folk dance
 veshbhusha main aitihaasik pramanikta kaa aagrah nahin bartaa gaya isse bhi lok-style kaa prabhaav jamaa rahaa
 The colors must be chosen carefully so that there is a possibility of color mixing in the grouping etc
 abhyaas teen-saadhe teen maheenon tak har din kiya gaya
 The dance, song, dialogue all went hand in hand
 mandali kaa koi bhi kalakaar vyavsaayik nartak yaa gayak nahin tha
 All came from hobbies — were amateurs
 yahi nahin, saath main se pachchis to aise the jinhone manch par isse pehle kabhi paanv na rakhe the
 But his labor, dedication and confidence were strong
 lagansheel, kalakaar, nrity-nirdeshak, sangeet-nirdeshak or nirdeshak ke sahyogi prayaskarm se hi yah alag dhang kii prastuti ho saki

 The first nine chapters are brief in this, but the tenth wing has expanded a lot
 isamen bhakthi kii pradhanta he
 Its two episodes "krishna's bal-leela" and "bhramar-geetasar" are extremely important
 sursagar main lagbhag ek lakh pad hone kii baat kahi jaati he
 But in the current editions, only about five thousand posts are found
 vibhinn sthanon par isaki sau se bhi adhik pratilipiyaan praapt hui hai, jinka pratilipi kaal sanwat 1658 vi0 se lekar unnisvin shatabdi tak he inamen pracheenatam pratilipi nathdwara ke saraswati bhandar main surakshit paayi gai hai
 In terms of philosophical views, there is a substantial difference between "bhagwat" and "sursagar"
 sursagar kii saraahna karte hue doctor hajaari prasad dvivedi ne likhaa he - Two forms of "sursagar" are found in the complete handwritten form - "collective" and "dwadash Scandal" according to Sanskrit Bhagavata
 sangrahatmak "sursagar" ke bhi do rup dekhne main aate hai
 The first, the first of the Bhagavalilic verse composed at the time of shree-vallabhacharya's disciple at your-gaughat- begins with "braj Bhayau maihair ke put, jab yaayi suni", the second - from "mathura-janma-leela"
 


 kaha jaataa he, hindi saahityetihaas granthon se ojhal "sursagar" ke utpatti vikaas kaa ek alag itihaas he, jo ab tak prakaash main nahin aayaa he or shri sur ke samakaleen bhakt itihaas rachayitaaon- "shri gokulanath ji, srihariraay ji or shri nabhadas ji prabhruti main jiskaa vishesh rup se ullekh kiya he
 Therefore, it is known from many important texts on these Purva that Shri Sur composed the post of Sahasravadhi, composed the post of Lakshavadhi, did not write any scripture
 baad main anant-sur-padaavalee sagar kahalaai
 In fact, Srisur, as it is known from the above reference texts, was Bhagavalli's emotion-free vocalist, always composing new verses, singing in front of his lord "govardhannathji"
 rachana karne vaale the, so nity savere se sandhya tak gaae jane vaale raagon main lalit rason kaa rang bharkar apni vaani kii tulika se chitrit kar apane ko dhanya kiya karte the
 Ashtu, neither did he have a sense of collecting his unmasked works nor did he have the desire to order many
 unka kaary to apane prabhu kii naanaa gunan garuli gunavali gaanaa, uske amritopam ras main nimagn ho jhoomna tathaa-"etechaansh kalapuns: krishnastu bhagwaan swayan" kii nandalay main bal se paugand avasthaa tak lilaon main tadatmbhaav se vibhor hona tha, yahan apni samast muktak rachanaaon ko ekatra kar krambaddh karne kaa samay or sthaan kahan tha
 It is said that Mr
 Surdas was "utterly blind," how did he collect all his compositions then? Yet the writing and compilation of the verses composed and sung by Surdas must have been going on
 anyathaa ve moulik rup se rachit or gaae gaye pad jupt ho gaye hote
 Perhaps Sur's contemporary disciples or friends — if Sur Sachmuch was blind — would have been writing and compiling those verses
 ab tak uske sangrahatmak yaa dwadas skandhaatmak banane kaa koi itihaas purnat: gyaat nahin he
 During the time of "geet-sangeet-sagar" Sri Vitthalnathji Goswami, many funds serviced by Srimadvallabhacharya, by your descendants, went out of Braj
 yat: sampradaay ke anusaar "kirtanon ke bina seva nahin or seva bina kirthan nahin" at: jahaan jahaan ye nidhiyaan gayi, vahiin vahiin "kanth" yaa "granth" rup main ashtchhaap ke kaviyon kii kritiyaan bhi gai or vahaan inke sankalit rup main-"nity kirthan" or "varshotsav" naam pade, aisa bhi kaha jaataa he
 The "collectible" form of the Sea of sur was compiled before Srisur
 uski san
 1630 vi
 kii likhi prati braj main milti he
 Many later written collections are also found in him
 mudrit rup iskaa kahin purana he
 First it was from Mathura, later from Agra, Jaipur, Delhi and Calcutta no
 In 1898, Leitho was published with a press release
 krishnanand vyasadev sankalit "ragakalpadrum" bhi is samay kaa sangrahatmak sursagar kaa ek vikrut rup he, jo sangeet ke rangon main banta hua he
 The famous poet "dwijdev" of Braj Bhasha - ie Maharaj Mansingh, Ayodhya Naresh, called it no
 It was edited in 1920 and published from Navalkishore Press, Lucknow
 ye sabhi sangrahatmak rup sursagar, bhagwaan shrikrishna kii janmlila gayan rup gokul nandalay main manaae gaye "nandamahotsav" se prarambh hokar unki samast brajalila mathura aagaman, uddhav-gopi-samvaad, shri ram, narsingh tathaa vaaman jayantiyaan evam pehle-shri vallabhacharya ji kii shishyta se purv rache gaye "deenta aashray" ke padon ke baad samaapt hue hai
 The trend of compilation of sur suras thus ended not only on the collective form of their ocean, but it progressed in various forms, so that their verses are seen in handwritten and printed forms of various works, which are as follows - Deen asylum posts
 , The astrological post, today called "sahityahari"
 ramayana, balalila ke pad, vinay patrika, vairagyasatak, surachhattisi, surbahottaree, sur bhramaragit, sura, surdaas nayan, murali maadhuri aadi-aadi, kintu ye sabhi sangrah aapke sangrahatmak "sagar kalpataru" ke hi madhur fal hai
 The form of the ocean of Sri Sur became Shri Vyas Praneeth and Shuk-mukh-nisrit "dwadash Skandhika"
 vah kab bana, kuch kaha nahin ja saktaa
 The literary texts of Hindi are silent in this subject
 is dwadash skandhaatmak "sur sagar" kii sabase pracheen prati san
 1757 vi
 kii milti he
 Many subsequent handwritten copies are found
 unke aadhaar par kaha ja saktaa he ki sur samudit sagar kaa yah "shrimadbhagwat anusaar dwadash skandhaatmak rup" atharahavin shatee ke pehle nahin ban paaya tha
 Its so-called "collectible" form had by this time gained considerable circulation
 saath hi is rup kii sundarataa, sarasata or bhashaa kii shuddhta evam manoharata main bhi koi vishesh antar nahin ho paaya tha
 She remained as beautiful as she was at the time of Sura, but she could not live properly in its twilight forms
 jyon jyon hastlikhit roopon main vah aage badhati gai tyon-tyon sur kii manjul bhashaa se dur hatati gai
 However, anyone who lost his existence and composed ungrammatical narrative stories like "hari, Hari, Hari Hari Sumran Kareo" and the "deenata asylum" posts created before Sri Sur came to Shrimadvallabhacharya's feet According to the first wing, not only the tenth wing, the latter, the eleventh and the twelfth wings are decorated, it is respected

 Anode rays or plus rays or canal rays are rays formed from positive ions that are produced in some gas discharge tubes
 inhen sabase pehle 1886 main german bhautikashastri eugen goldstin ne crooks-tub main prayog karte samay dekha tha
 Later works on anode rays were performed by Wilhelm Wein and JJ Thomson which resulted in the development of mass spectrometry
 bahut kam daab par kisi gas nalika main vidyuta visarjan karne par cathod kirnon kii utpatti hoti he
 These cathode rays are mere currents of electrons, a fact that Faraday and Crooks had known in the late 19th century and confirmed this well
 atyant teevr vidyut kshetra ke prabhaav main electron gasiy parmaanuon se vilag ho jate hai or tatkaal prabal veg se dhanagar kii ore bhaagate hai
 In order of fast migration, they collide with neutral atoms of the gas and release each of their electrons
 is prakaar mukt honevaale electron bhi apane muktidaata electronon kii bhanti bade veg se dhanagar kii ore bhaagate hai or inhen ke pravaah se cathod kirnon kii sristi hoti he
 With the release of electrons from gaseous atoms in this way, it is quite natural to assume that residual atoms will be positively charged, behave like cations and move in the opposite direction of the electrons, ie, the velocity, but their velocity is relatively large
 Due to this, the electrons will be significantly lower than that
 runagra ke sannikatavarti gasiy parivesh main utpann honevaali mand udipti sambhavat: inhen dhanayanon ke kaaran utpann hoti hogi
 The truth of the above logical hypotheses was first proved by Goldstein in 1895 by experiment
 visarjan nalika ke baahar nikal jaaen or ek vidyurshi, yaa photo plate, par paden
 The result was satisfactory and the estimates proved to be accurate
 photo plate or vidyutdarshi ne apane upar padanevaale aayan pravaah kaa dhanayanon kii dhara hi siddh kiya
 Goldstein called these rays canal rays
 1898 i

 The results of his experiment were as follows: uparyukt maanon kaa gyaat karne ke liye veen ne sanyukt chumbakeey evam vidyut kshetron kii vidhi kaa hi avlamban kiya tha, jo electronon ke liye prayukt hui thi, yadhyapi canal kirnon ke liye chumbakeey kshetra kaa prayog kar sakna apekshaakrit adhik kathin tha
 When comparing canal rays to cathode rays, it becomes clear that their velocity is only 1 / 100 times their velocity
 kalantar main radio sakriy padaarthon se alpha kirnon ke utsarjan kaa gyaan hua or yah pataa chalaa ki ye kirane bhi runagron kii hi ore aakrisht hoti hai
 Hence, it also appeared to be akin to canal rays

 Some of the most important parts are being divided into both male and female parts
 1 pushp-kesar This flower has a male part
 yah resha or paragakosh se bana he, yah sanyantr ke paraag utpaadan hissaa he
 The number of stamens is usually the same as the number of petals
 paragakeshar rakhanevaala phool kaa nagyah utpaadan or paraag jisamen punkesar kaa hissaa he
 It usually looks like a light hair that is on the top of a long stalk
 2 resha Sits on top of this anther that has fine hairy stalks
 1 pushp-yoni This flower has a female part
 yah kalank, style, or andashay se bana he
 Each pistil has one built for several rolled structures
 2 kalank One of the female parts of the flower

 3 style phool kaa ek anya mahila hissaa he
 At the top of this stigma sits that long stalk
 4 andashay Inside is the seed and that is the part of the plant, usually located under the flower, that turns into the fruit we eat

 The biological function of a flower is to mediate the union of male sperm and female spore
 prakriya paraagan se shuru hoti he, jiskaa anusaran garbhadhaaran se hota he, jo kii beej ke nirmaan or vikharaav / visarjan main khatm hota he
 For larger plants, the seeds serve as the core of the next plant, allowing one type of particular species to be immersed in other areas

 The flowering of flowers on a plant is called flowering
 paraag ko protsaahit karne ke liye pratyak pushp kii apni vishesh prakaar kii sanrachana hoti he
 Killistogamous flowers are self-pollinated, after which they may or may not open
 Many types of Viola and Salvi species have these types of flowers
 keetpremi phool kiton, chamgadadon, pakshiyon or jaanwaron ko aakarshith karte hai or ek phool se dusre ko paraag sthanantarit karne ke liye inkaa istemaal karte hai
 Generally, there is a gland in many parts of the flower! To get this attractive item of the same species of many flowers, the pollinator transfers the pollen to the pistil in all the flowers that are arranged exactly the same Huh
 phool-paudhe dwichhidranviy hote hai jo ki do prakaar ke chhidron kaa srijan karte hai
 Pollen and ovules are formed in separate organs, but a typical flower bears bisporangiate strobilus that has both organs
 phool ko ek sanshodhit tana kaha jaataa he, chote internodon or bering ke saath, iske nodes aise sanrachit hote hai jo kii ati sansodhit pattey ho sakate hai
 In short, the structure of a flower is on a modified stem on an anterior meristem, which does not grow continuously
 Flowers are attached to the plant in some ways
 yadi phool tane se jude nahin hote or unka nirmaan paton par hota he to unhen avrint kaha jaataa he jab phool kaa pushpan hota he, to use ek phuleey pushpan kaha jaataa he
 If the flowering flower ends in clusters of flowers, then each trunk that carries the flower is called pedicel

 The four main parts of the whorl are as follows: phulo kai bhaag - 1) diaphragm 2)pankhudi kaa vorl dalpunj 3) Xenium 4)strikesar 5) Pollen Hose 6)dwibipatri The primary purpose of flowering is reproduction
 Flowers are reproductive organs that mediate sperm from linking pollen to the ovule / testicles, normally from one plant to another, but many plants can pollinate their own flowers

 Sexual reproduction produces unique offspring, ready to adapt
 phulon kii ek vishisht sanrachana hoti he jo kii unhen ek hi nasl ke paraag ko ek paudhe se dusre paudhe main sthantarit karne ke liye prerit karti he
 Many plants depend on external factors for the transfer of pollen between flowers, including air and animals, especially insects
 Very large animals such as birds, bats and dwarf poses can also be employed / employed / used
 The period of time in which this process takes place is called anthesis
 aakarshith karne ke tareeke- phulo kaa aakarshith unke patti se hot he

 It can also be in two different types of studies
 bahut se phulon main ek yaa kuch vishisht prakaar ke jeevanuon se nikat sambandh hote hai
 For example, many flowers attract only one insect from a specific insect species, so depend on that insect for success

 In some flowers both stamens and pistil are capable of self-fertilization, which increases the chance of producing seeds but limits genetic diversity
 swanishechan ke ativaadee maamle un phulon main hote hai jo ki hamesh swanishechit hote hai, jaise ki kai kukrondhe
 In contrast, many plant breeds have their own ways of preventing self-fertilization
 ek hi paudhe par ek langeey nar or maadaa phool ek hi samay par dikhalaai nahin padate athwa paripakv nahin hote pichley prakaar ke phool, jinamein swayan ke paraag main rasinic avrodh hote hai, aise phulon ko atmamrit athwa baanjh ke rup main sanderbhit kiya jaataa he 
 In this way, the body of the flowers is formed and their veins have a vein configuration, which makes their food and water flow to the flowers

 "mahanova" is spelled "supernova" in English
 san 1604 main vaigyanik jonkepalar ek mahanova ko dekha tha, jiskaa naam aage chalakar "asafan 1604" rakhaa gaya
 Before this, Taco Brahe saw a Mahanova in 1572 called s ° n ° 1572
 unhone ise apni kitaab main laathini bhashaa main "de stella nova" bulaayaa jiskaa matlab he "nae taare ke bare main" jis se "nova" naam baith gaya, haalaanki iskaa arth laathini main sirf "nav" yaa "nayaa" tha
 By 1930, large explosions were called "mahanova" and smaller explosions were called "nova", but sometimes both names were used for the same thing

 rasochikitsa yaa rasy chikitsa yaa rasayan chikitsa yaa chemotherapy ek aisa aushadhiy upachaar he jo cancer kii koshikaon ko nasht karne ke liye diya jaataa he
 The term chemotherapy is made up of two words - chemical means chemotherapy and therapy
 ksi ko kis prakaar kii chemotherapy di jaae, iskaa nirnay is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki aapako kis prakaar kaa cancer he
 Chemotherapy may also be given alone or with surgery or radiotherapy
 chemotherapy anek tareekon se di ja sakati he, ise dene kii sabase aam vidhiyaan hai- Depending on your treatment, it can be given at various intervals, such as daily, weekly, every two / three weeks or continuously
 chemotherapy ke phaayde is baat par nirbhar karte hai ki aapako kis prakaar kaa cancer he or vah kitna bad chukaa he
 The objectives of chemotherapy include the following: chemotherapy upachaar ke anek sambhavit dushprinaam hai
 These side effects will depend on the type of chemotherapy suggested to you
 mukhyatah rakt koshikaayen teen prakaar kii hoti hai, jo is prakaar hai- Your blood cell count may decrease with chemotherapy treatment
 isliye aapke rakt kii jaanch niyamit taur par kii jaaegi
 The number of white cells, red cells and platelets will be seen in these investigations
 yadi chemotherapy upachaar dwaara aapaki safed koshikaayen ghat gai hai, to aapkesharir main sankraman se ladne kii kshamta kam ho jaaegi
 One way to know if you have an infection is to increase your body temperature
 yadi aapke sharir kaa taapmaana 37
5 degree celsius yaa usase adhik he, athwa aapako gale main ghaav hone, khaansee, zukam yaa dast jaise sankraman ke koi bhi lakshan najar aate hai, to aapako turant doctor se sampark karnaa chahie

 ye koshikaayen sharir ke sabhi angon tak oxigen pahunchaati hai
 If these are reduced, you may experience fatigue and yellowing, which is known as blood deficiency
 yadi aapaki laal koshikaayen saamaanya str se neeche hai, to aapako khun chadhvane kii jarurat pad sakati he
 These cells bind the blood flow, for example, when one of your organs is cut a little, then these cells bind the blood flow
 yadi chemotherapy ke kaaran aapaki platelets bahut kam ho gai hai to aap dekhge ki aapako aasaani se kharonchen lag jaati hai, athwa aapaki naak yaa masoodon se khun bahata he
 If your platelets numbers are below normal levels, you may need to mount platelets, otherwise we may have to postpone your treatment for some time
 cancer kii koshikaon ko nasht karne ke saath-saath chemotherapy upachaar aapke munh ke andar kii koshikaon ko bhi nasht kar saktaa he
 This can make your mouth red and you may feel a wound and discomfort in the mouth, as well as increase the chances of getting an infection in your mouth
 isliye yah jaruri he ki aap upachaar ke dauraan apane munh kaa vishesh rup se dhyaan rakhen

 har baar khaanaa khaane ke baad ek mulaayam datun or fluoride yukt manjan se apane daant saaf karen
 If you have a wound in your gums, use the powder used for sensitive teeth
 masoodon se shuru karte hue neeche kii ore brush karte hue apane daanton ko komalta se saaf karen
 If you do not have many wounds on your tongue, then you should also clean your tongue softly
 yadi aap nakli daant lagaate hai, to aapako unhen din main do baar saaf karnaa chahie or khaane ke baad acchhee tarah dhonaa chahie
 They should be soaked in water overnight and you should use a bactericidal solution once a week to disinfect them
 apane munh ko taazgi dene or nam rakhane ke liye adhik se adhik maatra main drav padaarth pien
 Cleaning your mouth with salt water can also be beneficial for you
 yadi aapako namak kaa prayog karnaa pasand nahin he to aap taaje pani se bhi aisa kar sakate hai
 If you have a wound in your mouth, a boil or a mouth ulcer, then you should inform your doctor directly
 vah aapako koi aisa upaay bataa saktaa he jisase aapako dard se raahat mil sake
 Sometimes chemotherapy treatment can affect your appetite

 If you need any kind of advice about eating and drinking during your chemotherapy treatment, you can ask your doctor or nurse to refer you to a dietician
 aapkaa swaad badal saktaa he, par praayah upachaar puraa hone ke do se teen maheenon ke bheetar vah phir se saamaanya ho jaataa he
 Chemotherapy treatment can sometimes cause nausea and / or vomiting
 kuch chemotherapy upachaaron dwaara anya kii tulana main michali aane kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 However, vomiting is an uncommon thing nowadays because you will be given medicines to relieve nausea which are often very effective

 phir bhi, yadi aapako in donon main se koi bhi pareshaani ho to kripaya apane doctor yaa nurse ko isaki jaankaree den kyonki aamtaur dawaaon dwaara yaa aapke aahaar main parivartan karke inkaa upachaar kiya ja saktaa he
 Some chemotherapy drugs can cause hair thinning, or unfortunately in some cases complete hair loss may occur
 yah samasya hameshaa asthai hoti he or aapkaa chemotherapy upachaar puraa hone par aapke bal punah waapas aa jaaenge
 Scalp cooling can be used for some types of chemotherapy treatments to reduce hair loss
 aisi koi vajah nahin he ki sambhog se parhez kiya jaae, lekin ham condom istemaal karne kii salaah dete hai
 It is possible that some part of the chemotherapy is in the fluid coming out of your body, so in this case the use of condoms will protect your partner
 yah jaruri he ki apane upachaar ke dauraan athwa upachaar ke baad kam se kam chah maheene tak aap garbhadhaaran na karen yaa yadi aap purush hai to apane saathi ko garbhvatee hone den
 The reason for this is that chemotherapy can be harmful for the child
 kuch chemotherapy upachaar aapaki janankshmata par pratikul prabhaav daal sakate hai
 This problem can be temporary as well as permanent
 chemotherapy kii kuch aushadhiyaan aapaki twachaa ko dhoop ke prati or adhik samvedansheel bana sakati hai

 Chemotherapy can make you feel more tired than you usually do
 yah jaruri he ki aap apane sharir kii jarurat kaa dhyaan rakhen or yadi aapako aaraam kii jarurat ho to aaraam karen, lekin yadi aapako lagata he ki aap saamaanya rup se kaamkaaj karne main sakasham hai to aisa jarur karen
 Some people find it beneficial to do light exercise as well as rest
 chemotherapy kii kuch aushadhiyaan, jo drip main yaa sui dwaara di jaati hai, agar aapaki nas ke baahar ris jaaen to twachaa or uske aas-paas ke kshetra ko nuksaan pahunchaa sakati hai
 This happens only in very rare situations, but it is important that you inform your nurse immediately about the place where you feel a drip, if you feel pain or irritation there
 aapke upachaar ke kai dinon baad tak aapke sharir ke drav padaarthon main kuch ansh main chemotherapy ke tatv maujuud ho sakate he
 Although the risk of harm from this is very low, it is important that others are exposed to chemotherapy
 isliye hamaari yah salaah he ki aap toilet kaa istemaal karne ke turant baad pani chalaa den or apane haath acchhee tarah se dhoen
 You should wear rubber gloves if the body fluids have spread or your hands are stuck on them
 chemotherapy upachaar karaane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki aap apane parivaar or doston ke saath kareebi sambandh nahin rakh sakate
 This includes kissing and hugging
 chemotherapy karaane vaale sabhi rogiyon ko flu hone kaa khatra hota he
 If you are undergoing chemotherapy in the autumn or winter, then you are advised against immunization from the flu
 uchit yah hoga ki aap apana chemotherapy upachaar shuru hone ke 7-10 din pehle hi tikaa lagava len
 If your chemotherapy has started, your immunity may not be as good as your response to immunity is likely to decrease
 isse aapkesharir kii rogapratikaarak paidaa karne kii kshamta ghatati he, jo aapako flu se bachaane ke liye jaruri hai
 If you get vaccinated during chemotherapy, you should do so only when your white cell count falls to normal levels
 yadi aapaki safed koshikaon kii sankhya kam he to aapako tikaa lagavane se bachanaa chahie kyonki aisa karne se aapke sharir kaa taapmaana bad saktaa he
 This can lead to a misunderstanding that you have a fever due to infection and as a result you may have to be treated unnecessarily in a hospital
 chemotherapy karaane ke dauraan yadi aap ghar par aswasth mahasoos karen or aapako yah lage ki aisa chemotherapy kii vajah se ho rahaa he to aapako hamen turant sampark karnaa chahie

 The village was completely autonomous and thus the central government was free from many responsibilities
 muslim or maratha kaalon main bhi kisi na kisi prakaar kii panchayat vyavastha chalati rahi or prayek gram apane main swaavlambee bana rahaa
 During the British rule, the panchayat system got the biggest shock and this system became disjointed
 phir bhi graamon ke saamaajik jivan main panchayatein bani raheen
 Each caste or class had its own separate panchayats which governed its social life and those who violated the system and rules of the panchayat were severely punished
 shashan kii ore se in panchayaton ke kaaryon main hastkshep nahin kiya jaataa tha
 From the beginning, the policy of the British was that the work of governance should, as much as possible, remain in the hands of as many state employees
 iske parinamswaroop faujadaari or divaani adaalaton kii sthapana, naveen rajasav niti, police vyavastha, gamnaagaman ke sadhano kaa vikaas aadi kaarnon se graamon kaa swaavlambee jivan or sthaneey swaittata dhire-dhire samaapt ho chali
 But later on the British also realized that due to their policy of centralization, the governance burden is increasing day by day

 Hence they were forced to take steps towards decentralization
 prarambh main jila bordon or municipal bordon kii sthapana kii gai
 The Royal Commission on Decentralization of 1907 acknowledged the importance of panchayats and wrote in its report that the foundation of any permanent organization, so that the active cooperation of the public with the administration should be in the villages
 kamishan ne sifarish kii ki kuch chune hue graamon main, jo parsparik dalbandi or jhagadon se mukt hon, panchayatein sthapit kii jaaen or prarambh main unhen simit adhikaar die jaaen
 In 1915, the then Government of India accepted the recommendations of the commission in principle, but in practice they were completely ignored
 bahut hi kam graamon main panchayatein bani; jo baniin, ve bhi sarkaar dwaara puri tarah niyantrit thi
 According to the Government of India Act in 1919, the provincial governments were given certain powers of self-government and around 1920 the Gram Panchayat Acts were enacted in all the provinces
 sanyukt pradesh main 1920 ke panchayat act ke adheen lagbhag 4700 gram panchayatein sthapit kii gayi

 On the other hand, the masters of the national movement felt that the economic and moral decline of the villages could be prevented only by the re-establishment of the panchayats
 gandhi ji ke graamon ke liye dassutri kaarykram main panchayaton ko sudrudh banane kii baat mukhya thi
 They wanted to make panchayats the cornerstone of independent India's governance
 1937 main saat praanton main sthapit congressi sarkaron ke saamne bhi yahi adarsh tha
 In Uttar Pradesh, jeevansudhar Samitis were formed in many villages which were entrusted with the task of village development
 is prakaar 1947 i
 tak graamon main sahi panchayat vyavastha kaa abhaav hi rahaa
 Active efforts to revive this system started after independence
 uttar pradesh main san 1947 main panchayat raaj adhinium banaaya gaya
 Under the Constitution, the "directive Elements of Politics" stated that the state's principal duty was "to lead the organization of Gram Panchayats" and "to give them such powers and powers as to enable them to function as units of autonomous governance"
