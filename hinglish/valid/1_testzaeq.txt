 dardi bhashaayen uttari pakistan, uttar-purvi afghanistan or bharat ke jammu-kashmir rajya main boli jaatin hai
 Among all the Dardi languages, the status of Kashmiri is the highest because it has its own popular literature and also has the honor of being an official language of India
 pakistan ke chitral zile kii khovaar bhashaa, uttari kashmir main boli jane vaali shina bhashaa or afghanistan ke purvi nuristaan, nangarhaar or kunar rajyon main boli jane vaali pashai bhashaa anya mashhoor dardi bhashaayen hai
 There are no two opinions that Sanskrit, Persian, Punjabi, hindi-urdu etc
 have influence on almost all Dardi languages and many of their words are used in Dardi languages
 lekin bahut bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke dardi bhashaaon ne bhi gair-dardi hindi-arya bhashaaon par apni chhap chodi he
 It is believed that some dialects of Punjabi, Uttarakhand and some other languages have an influence on Dardi
 haalanki is par vivaad jari he, lekin ek dharna yah bhi he ki pracheen kaal main dardi ek bahut bade kshetra main boli jaati thi jo sindhu nadi ke ird-gird or phir himachal or uttarakhand main failaa hua tha
 There are some special things in Dardi languages that make their identity in the entire indo-aryan language family, such that mahapraan consonants are pronounced like hypnotic consonants
 zyaadaatar hid-arya bhashaaon main mahapraan vyanjanon ko vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjan 'kha' ko munh se vaayu-pravaah se bolaa jaataa he jabaki uske milte hue alpapraan vyanjan 'k' ko bahut kam vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he
 This is not the case in Dardic languages
 in bhashaaon main vaayu-pravaah kii bajaay sur badal ke alpapraan or mahapraan vyanjanon main antar kiya jaataa he
 For example, where the word 'bhoomi' is in Sanskrit, there is 'buum' in the Khovar language, in which the voice goes from thick voice to thin tone
 isi tarah se jahaan hindi main mahapraani 'dha' se 'dhuaan' hota he vahaan pashai main alpapraani 'da' se 'duum' hota he
 In Kashmiri there is 'dod' instead of 'milk' in Sanskrit and 'milk' in Hindi
 pashchimi pahari ore punjabi main bhi isi tarah mahapraan ke sthaan par swar-badlaav dekhne ko miltaa he, jaise kii punjabi main hindi ke 'ghar' kii jagah swar badalata hua shabd 'kar' hota he
 Dardi languages often have syllable shifting, in which a vowel around the letter 'r' of the same word changes its place
 yah dardi bhashaaon main prachinkaal se hota aa rahaa he or gandhar kshetra main samraat ashok ke jamaane kii shilaon main bhi yah dekha ja saktaa he, jo 269 ipu se 231 ipu main khadi kii gai thim
 One title of Emperor Ashoka was 'priyadarshi' - but 'priyadrashi' is often seen on these rocks because of the syllable shifting, 'drisha' of 'darsha' became
 isi tarah in shilaon par 'dharm' ke sthaan par 'dhram' miltaa he
 In modern times, the word 'long' in Sanskrit can be seen in the word 'drig' in Kalash languages
 palula bhashaa main sanskrit kaa 'durbal' badal kar 'druble' ban jaataa he or sanskrit kaa 'bhurj' badal kar 'barhuj' ban jaataa he
 The ‘poor’ of Sanskrit becomes ‘drolid’ of Kashmiri and ‘karma’ becomes ‘kram’ in Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaaon kii yah pravriti punjabi or pashchimi pahari bhashaaon main bhi kuch had tak dekhi ja sakati he
 In Persian, where the tree is called 'dukht', in Punjabi it becomes 'drakht'
 adhiktar hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he
 But in Dardic languages, verb words come in the middle of a sentence
 is maamle main dardi bhashaayen angrezi kii tarah hotin hai
 In the sentences written above, the verb is written in thick letters
 jaisaa kii spasht he, lagbhag sari hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he, lekin dardik is niyam ko bhang karti he or angrezi kii tarah kriya ko sangya ke baad daalati he
 Such languages that are inserted after the verb noun are called "verb second languages"

 rahu naiysargik paap grah he
 According to astrology, Rahu is a disruptive and obstructing planet in auspicious works, so no auspicious work should be started in Rahu period
 grahon ke gochar ke kram main sabhi grahon kaa apana niyat samay hota he isi prakaar prayek diwas ek nishchit samay tak rahu kaal hota he
 Astrological opinion regarding Rahu period vaidic jyotish ke anusaar prayek din kaa ek bhaag rahu kaal hota he
 The duration of Rahukaal varies at different places depending on the sunrise and sunset
 rahu kaal praatkaal main kisi bhi din nahin hota he
 It has a different time, seven days a week
 somvaar ko yah din ke dwitiya bhaag main, shanivaar ko tisare bhaag main, shuukravaar ko chaturth bhaag main, buudhvaar ko paanchaven bhaag main, guruuvar ko chathe bhaag main, mangalvaar ko saatven bhaag main or ravivaar ke din aathven bhaag par rahu kaa prabhaav hota he
 Method of finding Rahu time rahu kaal gyaat karne ke liye vaidic jyotish main vishesh niyam bataaya gaya he
 According to this rule, the entire day from sunrise to sunset is divided into eight equal parts
 is gananaa main suryoday kaa samanya samay 6 baje subah mana jaataa he or suryaast kaa 6 baje shaam
is prakaar ek din 12 ghante kaa hota he
 The 12 hours are divided by 8
 is gananaa ke aadhaar par suryoday se suryaast tak din kaa prayek bhaag 1
5 ghante kaa hota he
 Thus, there is Rahu Kaal on each day
 din kaa vibhaajan or rahu kaal It is described in Vedic astrology that some time of every day remains under the influence of different planets
 grahon ke prabhaav se prayek kaal kaa apana mahatv hota he
 Mainly three parts of time have special importance in them
 samay ke ye teen mukhya bhaag hai yama gand, rahu kaal or kulik kaal
inamen kulik kaal main shubh kaary shuru kiya ja saktaa he jabaki rahu kaal or yama gand ko kisi bhi shubh kaam ko shuru karne ke liye shubh nahin mana gaya he
 Work in Rahu era rahu ko naiysargik ashubh kaarak grah mana gaya he
 The time that is under the influence of Rahu in transit, when the work related to Rahu is done at that time, then positive results are obtained in them
 is samay rahu kii shanti ke liye yajna kiye ja sakate hai
 During this period, Rahu is obstructed in performing the yajna and the work related to the auspicious planets
 shubh grahon kii puja va yajna is avadhi main karne par parinaam apurna praapt hota he
 Therefore, if you consider Rahu period before starting any work, then there is more possibility of compatibility in the result

sahaayak pralekhan QOP-85-03 sudharatmak or nivarak karravaaiyaan The ISO 9000: 1987 structure was very similar to the UK standard BS 5750, with three "models" of quality management systems selected based on the scope of the organization's activities: ISO 9000:1987 maujuuda america or anya difens standard se bhi prabhavit tha or isliye vinirmaan ke liye bahut anukool tha
 Particular emphasis was placed on customizing with functionalities rather than overall management processes — similar to the original intent

 Although commonly referred to as ISO 9000: 2000 certification, the actual standard by which an organization's quality management can be certified is ISO 9001: 2008
 pratyaayan nikaay or pramann nikaay donon apni-apni sevaaon ke liye shulk lete hai

 If there is no major problem on this list, or how any problem will be solved, after obtaining a satisfactory improvement plan from the management explaining it, the certifying body has an ISO for each geographical location visited by it
 9001 will issue the certificate

 The following questions are generally the focus of debate on the effectiveness of ISO 9000: ise vyapak rup se sweekaar kiya gaya he ki uchit gunvattta prabandhan aksar nivesh, share vipanan, bikri vruddhi, bikri margin, pratispardhi laabh or mukademebaaji ke parihaar par ek sakaaratmak prabhaav daalkar vyavsaay main sudhaar laata he
 The quality principles of ISO 9000: 2000 are also very good according to Wade, and Barnes, who states "ISO 9000 guidelines provide a comprehensive model for quality management systems that can make any company competitive
 " barns loyad ke register quality esurance ke ek surveykshan kaa bhi uddhrut dete hai jisane sanket diya ki ISO 9000 ne shuddh laabh main badhottaree kii, tathaa vah ek or surveykshan kaa uddhrut prastut karte hai jise deloit-tach ne kiya tha jisane khabar di ki panjikaran kii laagat ko teen saalon main vasula gaya
 Implementation of ISO provides the following benefits, according to Providence Business News: haalanki, 800 spanish companiyon ke ek vyapak sankhyikeey adhyayan se pataa chalaa ki ISO 9000 panjikaran apane aap main hi thodaa-bahut sudhaar laata he kyonki isamen ruchi lene vaali companiyon ne aam taur par pehle se hi gunvattta prabandhan ko kuch is tarah kii patibaddhta kii he or panjikaran se pehle bas aise hi uskaa pradarshan kar rahi thi
 a common criticism of ISO 9001 is the amount, time and paperwork required for registration
 barns ke anusaar, "virodhiyon kaa daawa he ki yah keval pralekhan ke liye he
 Proponents believe that if a company has documented its quality systems, most of the paperwork has already been completed
 " In no way is ISO 9001 an indication that products produced using its certified systems are in any way good
 ek company karaab gunvattta vaale utpaada kaa utpaadan karne kaa iraadaa kar saktaa he or lagaataar evam uchit pralekhan ke saath is par ISO 9001 kaa mohar laga saktaa he
 According to Seddon, ISO 9001 promotes specification, control, and procedures rather than understanding and improvement
 vade kaa tark he ki ISO 9000 ek dishanirdesh ke rup main prabhavi he, lekin ise ek maanak ke rup main badhaava dene par "yah companiyon kii soch ko gumraah karne main madad karata he ki pramann kaa matlab behatar gunvattta he, 


 jisase sanghathan ko apane khud ke gunvattta maanakon ko sthapit karne kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 "as elaborated, Wade argues that relying on the specifications of ISO 9001 does not guarantee a successful quality system
 antarrashtriya str par manyata praapt hone par bhi zyaadaatar america upabhokta ISO 9000 ke bare main jaanate nahin hai or yah unke liye koi mahatv rakhti he
 The additional cost of certifying and then maintaining the certificate cannot be justified if the end-users of the product do not require ISO 9000
 vastav main is laagat se ek company ko ek gaiyr ISO 9000 pramanit company ke khilaaf pratispardhaa karte samay ek pratispardhaatmak nuksaan kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he
 This standard is seen as a danger of failure especially when a company is interested in certification before quality
 In fact, certifications are often based on the customer's contractual requirements rather than a desire to improve quality
 "yadi aap keval diwaar par pramaan patr dekhnaa chaahate hai, to ho saktaa he, aap ek aisi kagaji pranali kaa nirmaan karenge jiske liye aapako zyada kuch karne kii jarurat nahin he jis tarah se aap apane vyavsaay ko chalaanaa chaahate ho," ISO ke roger frost ne kaha
 ek swatantra lekha pareekshak dwaara pramann ko aksar ek samasya kshetra ke rup main dekha jaataa he or barns ke anusaar "paraamarsh sevaayen badhaane kaa ek madhyam ban gaya he

 Due to internal unrest, famine and Maratha encroachment, silver production declined during the era of Rana Arisingh

 In such a situation, new coins were collected from silver stored in the state treasury, which came to be known as Arashi Shahi coins

 Sahib has been praised in the Sikh history of Guru Arjun Dev Ji's son, Guru Hargobind Sahib, as a dal-bhanjan warrior
 guru hargobind sahib kii shiksha diksha mahaan vidvan bhai gurdas kii dekh-rekh main hui
 Guru ji was equally blessed with Baba Budaji
 chathe guru ne sikh dharm, samskruti evam isaki aachaar-samhita main anek aise parivartanon ko apni ankhon se dekha jinke kaaran sikhi kaa mahaan bootaa apni jade majboot kar rahaa tha
 Guru Hargobind Sahib gave protection to this great plant of heritage with his divine vision and gave it an opportunity to flourish
 apane pita shri guru arjuna dev kii shahidi ke adarsh ko unhone na keval apane jivan kaa uddeshy mana, balki unke dwaara jo mahaan kaary prarambh kiye gaye the, unhen safalataa purvak sampoorn karne ke liye aaajeevan apni patibaddhta bhi dikhalaai
 According to the changing circumstances, Guru Hargobindsaheb also took up the education of arms and scripture

 Guru - He assumed the two swords of Miri and Piri as soon as he assumed the throne
 miri or piri kii donon talavaarein unhen baba boddaji pahanaai
 It is from here that Sikh history takes a new mode

 In this process politics and religion became complementary to each other

 Jahangir's wife was a servant of Noor Jahanmiyanamir

 jahangir ne keval guru ji ko hi gwalior ke kile se aaazaad nahin kiya, balki unhen yah swatantrata bhi di ki ve 52raajaaon ko bhi apane saath lekar ja sakate hai
 That is why in Sikh history, Guru Ji is called a prisoner and a donor

 Guru ji fought with Shah Jahan four times while remaining firm on his life values
 ve yuddh ke dauraan sadaiv shant, abhaya evam adol rahete the

 guru ji ne apni sujh-boojh se guru ghar ke shraddhaluon ko sugathit bhi kiya or sikh-samaaj ko nai disha bhi pradaan kii
 Akal Takht Sahib emerged as the supreme institution for the Sikh society, which concentrated Sikh power in the future and gave it a distinct social and historical identity

 shri guru granth sahib ke mahaan sandesh ne guru-parampara ke un kaaryo ko bhi prakaashmaan banaaya jiske kaaran bhavishya main maanavtaa kaa maha kalyaan hone ja rahaa tha
 Due to these untiring efforts of Guru Ji, the Sikh tradition was also taking a new form and redefining the dignity of its heritage in new contexts
 guru hargobindsahib kii chintan kii disha ko nae vyaavhaarik arth de rahe the
 In fact it was the effect of his aura and power
 guru ji ke vyaktitv or krittitvaka gaharaa prabhaav puure parivesh par bhi padane laga tha
 Guru Hargobindsaheb used all his strength to establish the ideals of Harmandirsahib and Akal Takht Sahib

 guru hargobind sahib ji jab kashmir kii yatra par the tab unki mulaakaat mata bhagbhari se hui thi jinhone pehali mulaakaat par unase poocha ki kya aap guru nanak dev ji hai kyonki unhone guru nanak dev ji ko nahin dekha tha
 He had made a big chola for Guru Nanak Dev Ji, which had 52 cloves, he had made this cloth a little bigger after hearing about him that his body is a little heavier
 mata kii bhaawanaaon ko dekhte hue guru sahib ne ye chola unase lekar pahan liya
 When Guru Sahib was freed from the fort of Gwalior, he wore this same chola, whose 52 kings, holding 52 buds, came out one by one in the prison of the fort, since then Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji called "donor Bandi Chod"

 With the establishment of the Indian space program in 1962, it started the launch of the research rocket, in which the proximity of the equator proved to be a boon
 ye sabhi nav-sthapit thumba bhu-madhyi rocket anusandhan kendra se prakshepit kiye gaye, jo ki dakshin kerala main tiruvantpuram ke sameep sthit he
 Initially, research rockets from the US and France were launched to study upper pressure, like Naik Apache and Kentor respectively, until the study began with ship-based research rockets in the Pacific Ocean

 Yet from day one, the space program had a high ambition for developing indigenous technology and this led to India starting its own research rocket using solid fuel, dubbed Rohini

 It is called Las Belo in Sindhi accent
 yah 30 june 1954 ko us samay ke kalaat vibhaag ke andar ek alag zile ke rup main gathit kiya gaya tha
 The district consists of 9 tehsils and 21 federal councils
 lasabela main baloch logon or sindhi logon kaa ek mishran rahata he
 The Jamot community of Sindhis is in large numbers here
 jamot ek rajput samudaay he jo swayan ko sammaan rajvansh kaa vanshaj samajhataa he
 Almost all people are Muslim although a small Hindu community also exists

 If the coastal route to Makran is adopted between the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent, Lasbella falls on it
 sikandar mahaan jab pashchimottar bharat par qabza karne ke baad babilon laut rahaa tha to lasabela se guzara tha
 In 711 AD, Muhammad bin Qasim, the warlord of Umayyad Khilafat, also came out of Lasbela to attack Sindh

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga hindu dharm ek dharm he jiske anuyaayi adhikanshtah bharat ,nepal or morishas main bahumat main hai
 It is called the oldest religion in the world
 ise 'vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm' bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he ki isaki utpatti maanav kii utpatti se bhi pehle se he
 Scholars consider Hinduism to be a blend of different cultures and traditions of India, which has no founder
 yah dharm apane andar kai alag-alag upasna paddatiyaan, mat, sampradaay or darshan samete hue hai
 It is the third largest religion in the world based on the number of followers
 sankhya ke aadhaar par iske adhiktar upaask bharat main hai or pratishat ke aadhaar par nepal main hai
 Although many deities are worshiped in it, it is in fact a monotheistic religion
 ise sanathan dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kehete hai
 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"
 hindu keval ek dharm yaa sampradaay hi nahin he apitu jivan jeene kii ek paddati he
 Sanatana Dharma is one of the oldest religions on Earth; However, many scholars have many opinions about its history
 aadhunik itihaaskaar hadappa, mehrgarh aadi puratathvik anveshanon ke aadhaar par is dharm kaa itihaas kuch hazaar varsh purana maanate hai
 Where many signs of Hinduism are found in Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, bhagwaan shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, shivlinga, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts
 hindu manyata ke anusaar veda, upanishad aadi granth anadi, nity hai, ishwar kii krupa se alag-alag mantradrashtaa rishiyon ko alag-alag granthon kaa gyaan praapt hua jinhone phir unhen lipibaddh kiya
 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion
 naye devtaa or naye darshan ubhare
 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he
 Therefore, Sapta Sindhu converted to Aventan language and converted to Hinduism
 iske baad iraniyon ne sindhu nadi ke purv main rahane waalon ko hindu naam diya
 When Muslim invaders from Arabia came to India, they started calling the original religious people of India as Hindus
 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"
 iske antargat kai mat or sampradaay aate hai or sabhi ko baraabar shraddha di jaati he
 The scriptures are also many
 fir bhi, wo mukhya siddhanth, jo zyaadaatar hindu maanate hai, in sab main vishwaas: dharm, karm, punarjanm kaa sansaarik chakra, moksh or beshak, ishwar
 Hinduism considers heaven and hell to be temporary
 hindu dharm ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi praaniyon main aatma hoti he
 Man is the only creature who can enjoy both sin and virtue in this world and can attain salvation
 hindu dharm main chaar mukhya sampradaay hai : vaishnav, shaiva, shakt or smart 
 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect
 prachinkaal or madhyakaal main shaiva, shakt or vaishnav aapas main ladate rahete the
 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent
 sankshep main, hindutv ke pramukh tatva nimnlikhit hai-hindu-dharm hindu-koun?-- goshu bhakthirbhavedyasya pranave c drudha matih
 Reincarnation Belief: True Hinduism
 
 That is, one who has devotion in Gomata, who has a worshiping mantra, who believes in rebirth - he is a Hindu
 merutantra 33 prakaran ke anusaar ' hinan doodhyati sa hindu ' arthath jo hin ko dooshit samajhataa he vah hindu he
 According to Lokmanya Tilak- Asindho: Sindhuparyanta Yesya Bharatbhumika
 pitrubhuh punyabhushchaev sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath- sindhu nadi ke udgam-sthaan se lekar sindhu tak sampoorn bharat bhoomi jisaki pitrubhu tathaa punyabhu he, vah hindu kehalaata he
 The word Hindu is originally Pharsi, it means those Indians who are native and native of the boundary of Bharatvarsha described in the ancient texts of India, Vedas, Puranas
 kalika puraana, medni kosh aadi ke aadhaar par vartmaan hindu laa ke moolbhoot aadhaaron ke anusaar vedpratipaadit varnashram reeti se vaidic dharm main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu he
 Although some people consider the mixed form of many cultures to be Indian culture, whereas it is not
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
 parabrahm aseem, anant or rup-sharir viheen he
 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he
 Other names of God are: Parameshwara, Paramatma, Vidhata, Bhagavan
 isi ishwar ko musalman allaah, khuda, isai god or yahudee yahveh kehete hai
 There are many gods in Hinduism, which are incorrectly called "gods" in English
 ye devtaa koun hai, is bare main teen mat ho sakate hai : One more thing that can be said is that most of the Vaishnava and Shaiva philosophy consider the first two ideas together
 jaise, krishna ko parameshwar mana jaataa he jinke adheen baaki sabhi devi-devtaa hai or saath hi saath, sabhi devi-devataaon ko krishna kaa hi rup mana jaataa he
 Scriptures do not recognize the third opinion
 jo bhi soch ho, ye devtaa rang-birangi hindu samskruti ke abhinn ang hai
 The main devas of the Vedic period were Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Rudra, Vishnu, Prajapati, Savita and the goddesses - Saraswati, Usha, Prithvi, etc
 baad ke hindu dharm main naye devi devtaa aaye -- ganesh, ram, krishna, hanuman, kartikeya, surya-chandra or grah or deviyaan jaise-- durga, parvati, lakshmi, sheetala, sita, kaali, ityadi
 All these deities are mentioned in the Puranas and their total number is stated to be 33 koti
 puraanon ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv saadhaaran dev nahin, balki mahadev hai or trimurti ke sadsy hai
 Apart from all this, cow is also worshiped as a mother in Hinduism
 yah mana jaataa he ki gaay main sampoorn 33 koti devi devtaa vaas karte hai
 Five major deities are revered in Hinduism beliefs
 ye ek ishwar ke hi alag-alag rup or shaktiyaan hai
 Jupiter is considered the guru of the gods
 puranic manyataon ke anusaar ve maharishi angira ke putr the
 He attained the position of Devguru through the hard tenacity of Lord Shiva
 unhone apane gyaan bal va mantra shaktiyon se devataaon kii raksha kii
 He is also revered as a Guru planet by the grace of Shiva
 guuruuvaar, guru brihaspatidev kii upasna kaa vishesh din he
 Shukracharya, the guru of the demons, is considered
 brahmadev ke putr maharishi bhrigu inke pita the
 It was Shukracharya who received the dead Sanjivani Vidya by performing harsh penance of Shiva, by which he used to burn his life again in the dead body
 brahmadev kii krupa se yah shukr grah ke rup main poojaneey hai
 Friday is the special day of worship of Venus
 hindu dharm ke anusaar har chetan praani main ek abhautik aatma hoti he, jo sanathan, avyakt, aprameya or vikaar rahit he
 According to Hinduism, not only human beings, but every animal and plant, that is, every living being has a soul
 bhagavadgita main bhagwaan shrikrishna dwaara aatma ke lakshan is prakaar bataae gaye hai: In any birth, according to the deeds done freely, the soul assumes the next body
 janm-maran ke chakra main aatma swayan nirlypt rahte hue aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 With the effect of good karma, a person can be born in an aristocratic home or vagina, while bad karma has to be born in a bad vagina
 janm maran kaa sansaarik chakra tabhi khatm hota he jab vyakti ko moksh miltaa he
 After that the soul attains its true satti-joy nature forever
 maanav yoni hi akelaa aisa janm he jisamen manushya ke karm, paap or punyamay fal dete hai or sukarm ke dwaara moksh kii prapti mumkin he
 The same beliefs about soul and rebirth are also the basis of Buddhism and Sikhism
 hindu dharm ke pavitra granthon ko do bhaagon main baanta gaya he- shruti or smriti
 Shruti is the supreme text of Hinduism, which is completely unchanging, that is, it cannot be changed in any era
 smriti granthon main desh-kalanusaar badlaav ho saktaa he
 Vedas under the Shruti: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda Brahma Sutras and Upanishads
 veda shruti isaliye kahe jate hai kyonki hinduon kaa maananaa he ki in vedon ko paramatma ne rishiyon ko sunaaya tha, jab ve gahare dhyaan main the
 The Vedas were given to the disciples by the Guru according to the Shravan tradition
 har veda main chaar bhaag hai- samhita—mantra bhaag, brahman-granth—gadhy bhaag, jisamen karmkand samajhaaye gayi hai, aaranyak—inamen anya good baaten samajhaai gayi hai, upanishad—inamen brahm, aatma or inke sambandh ke bare main vivechna kii gayi he
 If there is a dispute between Shruti and Smriti then only Shruti will be valid
 shruti ko chhodkar anya sabhi hindu dharmagranth smriti kahe jate hai, kyonki inamen wo kahaniyaan hai jinako logon ne peedi dar peedi yaad kiya or baad main likhaa
 All Smriti texts praise the Vedas
 inako vedon se nichalaa str praapt he, par ye zyaada aasaan hai or adhikansh hinduon dwaara padhe jate hai 
 The major Smriti texts are: History - Ramayana and Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita, Purana -, Manusmriti, Dharmashastra and Dharmasutra, Agam Shastra
 bhartiya darshan ke 6 pramukh ang hai- sankhya darshan, yoga, nyaay, vaisheshik, mimasaa or veydant
 According to Hindu scriptures, the demons of the deity religion are the symbol of unrighteousness

 There were no temples during the ancient Vedic period

 According to one view, due to the worship of Buddha and Mahavira idols and temples by Buddhist and Jain religions, Hindus too started building temples after being influenced by them

9563 Varanasi) is a famous city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh
 ise 'banaras' or 'kaashi' bhi kehete hai
 It is considered to be one of the most sacred cities in Hinduism and is known as the non-free Zone
 iske alaava buddha evam jain dharm main bhi ise pavitra mana jaataa he
 It is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world and the oldest inhabited city in India
 kaashi naresh varanasi shahar ke mukhya saanskrithik sangrakshak evam sabhi dharmik kriya-kalapon ke abhinn ang hai
 The culture of Varanasi is inextricably linked to the river Ganges and its religious significance
 ye shahar sahasron varshon se bharat kaa, visheshkar uttar bharat kaa saanskrithik evam dharmik kendra rahaa he
 The Banaras Gharana of Hindustani classical music was born and developed in Varanasi itself
 bharat ke kai darshanik, kavi, lekhak, sangitajna varanasi main rahe hai, jinamein kabir, vallabhacharya, ravidaas, swami ramanand, trailang swami, shivanand goswami, munshi premchand, jaishankar prasad, acharya ramchandra shukla, pandit ravi shankar, girija devi, pandit hari prasad chaurasia evam ustad bismillah khan aadi kuch hai
 Goswami Tulsidas wrote Ramcharitmanas, the most revered book of Hinduism here, and Gautam Buddha gave his first sermon here in Sarnath
 varanasi main chaar bade vishvavidhyalay sthit hai: banaras hindu vishvavidhyalay, mahatma gandhi kaashi viapeeth, central institute of hyer tibetian studies or sampoornanand sanskrit vishvavidhyalay
 The residents here mainly speak Kashika Bhojpuri, which is a dialect of Hindi
 varanasi ko praayah 'mandiron kaa shahar', 'bharat kii dharmik rajdhani', 'bhagwaan shiv kii nagari', 'deepon kaa shahar', 'gyaan nagari' aadi visheshnon se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 Eminent American writer Mark Twain writes: "benaras is more ancient than history, older than traditions, older than legends and, when collected, is twice as old as that collection
 " The name Varanasi probably originates from the name of two local rivers, the Varuna River and the Asi River
 ye nadiyaan ganga nadi main kramshah uttar evam dakshin se aakar milti hai
 Another idea of the name comes from the name of the river Varuna, which may have been called Varanasi in ancient times and this is how the city got its name
 iske samarthan main shaayad kuch aarambhik paath uplabdh hon, kintu is duusare vichaar ko itihaasavetta sahi nahin maanate hai
 For a long time, Varanasi has also been referred to as the non-liberated region, anand-kanan, Mahashmshan, Surandhan, Brahmavart, Sudarshan, Ramya, and Kashi
 rugveda main shahar ko kaashi yaa kasi naam se bulaayaa gaya he
 It is derived from the word published, which refers to the historical level of the city, as the city has always been the center of knowledge, education and culture
 kaashi shabd sabase pehle atharvaveda kii papplad shakha se aayaa he or iske baad shatapath main bhi ullekh he
 But it is possible that the name of the city is old in the district
 skanda puraana ke kaashi khand main nagar kii mahima 15,000 shlokon main kahi gayi he
 In a verse, Lord Shiva says: teenon lokon se samahit ek shahar he, jisamen sthit meraa nivas prasaad he kaashi Another reference to Varanasi is given by sage Ved Vyas in another prose: ganga tarang romantic jatkalapnaam, gauri nirantar vibhooshit vambhagam
narayanprium anang madapaaaram, varanasipur patim bhaj vishwanatham The name of the river Varanavati has appeared in the Atharvaveda, which is most likely used for the modern Varuna river itself
 assi nadi ko puraanon main asisambhed tirth kaha he
 The Kashi section of Skanda Purana states that all the pilgrimages of the world together do not equal the sixteenth part of the Asisambheda
 agnipurana main asi nadi ko vyutpann kar nasi bhi kaha gaya he
 If we step down the river Varanasi, a river named Nasi has been removed, which later changed to the name Asi
 mahabharat main varuna yaa aadhunik barna nadi kaa pracheen naam varnasi hone kii pushti hoti he
 Hence, the word Varanasi is formed after the name of two rivers
 padam puraana ke kaashi mahatmaya, khand-3 main bhi shloke he: Varanasi City Familiarity Tanaman Nigam and: north-east jaruvi pashchimetrapi pashpanirganeshvar:
 
 matsay puraana main shiv varanasi kaa varnan karte hue kehete hai - Varanasayam River Pu Siddhagandharveshvita
 pravishta tripatha ganga tasmin kshetre mam priye
 Eighty is not mentioned here
 varanasi kshetra kaa vistaar bataate hue matsay puraana main ek or jagah kaha gaya he- Varna Ch River Yavadivachushkhanadi and
 bhismayandikmarmbh parvateshwarmanti ke
 It is known from the above quotes that the city was actually named after settling on Varanasi
 assi or varuna ke bich main varanasi ke basane kii kalpana us samay se udai hui jab nagar kii dharmik mahima badi or uske saath-saath nagar ke dakshin main aabaadi badhane se dakshin kaa bhaag bhi uski seemaa main aa gaya
 By the way, the word Varana is also the name of a tree
 prachinkaal main vrikshon ke naam par bhi nagaron ke naam padate the jaise koshamb se kaushambi, rohit se rohitak ityadi
 Therefore, it is possible that both Varanasi and Varanavati got their name only from this particular tree
 varanasi naam ke uparokt kaaran se yah anumaan kadaapi nahin lagaana chaiye ki is nagar ke se ukt vivechan se yah na samaj lenaa chahie ki kaashi rajya ke is rajdhani shahar kaa keval ek hi naam tha
 Many names are found in Buddhist literature alone
 udai jataka main surrundan, sutasom jataka main sudarshan, somdand jataka main brahmavardhan, khandhhal jataka main pushpavati, yuvanjay jataka main ramm nagar, shankh jataka main molino naam aate hai
 It was also known as Kasinagar and Kasipur
 samraat ashok ke samay main isaki rajdhani kaa naam potli tha
 It cannot be said with certainty that all these names were from the same city, or the names of more than one capitals of different times of the Kashi kingdom
 puranic kathaon ke anusaar, kaashi nagar kii sthapana hindu bhagwaan shiv ne lagbhag 5000 varsh purv kii thi, jis kaaran ye aaj ek mahatvapurn tirth sthal he
 It is one of the holy Saptapuris of Hindus
 skanda puraana, ramayana, mahabharat evam pracheenatam veda rugveda sahit kai hindu granthon main is nagar kaa ullekh aata he
 Generally, Varanasi city is considered to be around 3000 years old
 , parantu hindu paramparaon ke anusaar kaashi ko isse bhi atyant pracheen mana jaataa he
 The city has been a commercial and industrial center for muslin and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory and crafts
 gautam buddha ke kaal main, varanasi kaashi rajya kii rajdhani hua karata tha
 Renowned Chinese traveler Xuan Tsang has described the city as a center for religious, educational and artistic activities and has written an extension of 5 km on the banks of the Ganges River
 kaashi main pracheen kaal se samay samay par anek mahaan vibhootiyon kaa pradurbhaav yaa vaas hota rahaa hai
 Some of these are as follows: varanasi 18veen shatabdi main swatantra kaashi rajya ban gaya tha or baad ke british shashan ke adheen, ye pramukh vyapaarik or dharmik kendra rahaa
 In 1910, the British administration made Varanasi a new Indian state and made Ramnagar its headquarters, but it had no jurisdiction
 kaashi naresh abhi bhi ramnagar kile main rahete hai
 This fort is situated on the banks of the Ganges in the east of Varanasi city
 ramnagar kile kaa nirmaan kaashi naresh raja balavant singh ne uttam chunaar balua pathar ne 18veen shatabdi main karavaaya tha
 The fort is built in the Mughal architectural style with carved balconies, open courtyards and picturesque domed pavilions
 kaashi naresh kaa ek anya mahal chait singh mahal he
 It was built by Maharaja Chait Singh near Shivala Ghat
 ramnagar kila or iskaa sangrahalay ab banaras ke raajaaon kii aitihaasik dharohar rup main sangrakshit hai or 18veen shatabdi se kaashi naresh kaa aadhikarik awaas rahe hai
 Even today, the people of Kashi Naresh Nagar are respected
 ye nagar ke dharmik adhyaksh maane jate hai or yahaan ke log inhen bhagwaan shiv kaa avatar maanate hai
 Naresh has been the chief cultural patron of the city and an integral part of all major religious activities
 varanasi shahar kaa bada ansh atiprachinkaal se kaashi kaha jaataa he
 It is considered to be the biggest pilgrimage in Hindu belief, but the earliest mention of Varanasi as a pilgrimage is found in Mahabharata
 mahabharat-purv ke kisi sahitya main kisi bhi tirth aadi ke bare main koi ullekh nahin he
 Today's pilgrimage centers were mostly forested and devoid of humans
 kahin-kahin adivaasiyon kaa vaas rahaa hoga
 Later, the stories told about the pilgrimage came into existence and the pilgrimage grew, around which the city and city also resided
 bharatbhumi main aaryon ke prasar ke dwaara tirthon ke astitv tathaa mahatmay kaa pataa chalaa
 It is mentioned in Mahabharata that some places of the earth are sacred and sacred
 inamen se koi to sthaan kii vichitrataa ke kaaran koi janm ke prabhaav or koi rishi-muniyon ke sampark se pavitra ho gaya he
 An important description about Kashi comes in the Yajurvedic Jabaal Upanishad, but modern scholars do not consider this Upanishad as ancient
 jabal-upanishad khand-2 main maharishi atri ne maharishi yajyavlky se avyakt or anant paramatma ko jaanane kaa tarika poocha
 Then Yajnavalkya said that that latent and eternal soul can be worshiped in the free zone, because it is right there
 or atri ke avimukt kii sthiti poochne par
 Yajnavalkya replied that he was in the middle of the rivers Varana and Nashi
 vah varna kya he or vah nashi kya he, yah poochne par uttar mila ki indriya-krit sabhi dosha kaa nivaaran karne vaali varna he or indriya-krit sabhi paapon kaa naash karne vaali nashi he
 He is the deity place of the deity free and the Brahma Sadan of all beings
 vahaan hi praaniyon ke praan-prayaag ke samay main bhagwaan rudra tarak mantra kaa upadesh dete he jiske prabhaav se vah amriti hokar moksh praapt karata he
 Therefore, one should always reside in the free and the free
 usko kabhi na chode, aisa yajyavlky ne kaha he
 Apart from the Jabalopinashad, Kashi has also been mentioned in many memories such as Likhtamriti, Shringamismriti and Parasharsmriti, Brahmi Singhhita and Santkumarasamhita
 praayah sabhi puraanon main kaashi kaa mahatmaya kaha gaya he
 In Brahmavaivarta Purana, there is only a full text on the Kashi area called kashi-rahasya, which is called its bloom
 padam puraana main kaashi-mahatmaya or anya sthanon par bhi kaashi kaa ullekh aata he
 Sixteen chapters in the ancient Linga Purana were in connection with the pilgrimages of Kashi
 varttman lingapurana main bhi ek adhyay he
 The Kashi Khand of Skanda Purana discusses and describes in detail the holy form of Kashi
 is prakaar puraana-sahitya main kaashi ke dharmik mahatmaya par saamagree he
 Apart from this, Kashi is also mentioned in sanskrit-vadmay, Daskumarcharit, Naishadh, Rajatarangini and Kuttanipatam
 12veen shatabdi isvi tak praapt hone vaale ling puraana main tisare se attharahawein adhyay tak kaashi ke devaytanon tathaa tirthen kaa vistrut varnan tha
 The Lingapurana was the same in the composition of the Tristhalisetu Granth
 arthath lingapurana main bhi tisare se solahaven adhyay tak lingo kaa varnan kiya he
 In the present Linga Purana, only one chapter is about Kashi, which contains only 144 verses
 is prakaar mahabharat ke alaava yadi sabhi puraanon ke ullekh dekhen, to kaashi ke tirth rup ke ullekh kii suchi bahut lambii banati he
 There are 264 pilgrimages mentioned in the word Kalkalpadrum, but in the idea of glory, the names of Char Dham and Saptapuris are considered at the top among the pilgrimages of India
 prayag, gaya or gangasagar tak ke naam inamen nahin aate
 Therefore, it can also be ruled out
 varanasi kshetra ke vistaar ke anek puranic uddhran uplabdh hai
 According to the pilgrimage discussion and other ancient texts given in Karyakalpataru: uparokt uddharanon se gyaat hota he ki pracheen varanasi kaa vistaar kaaphi dur tak tha
 The fort of Rajghat west of Varuna where ancient Varanasi is no doubt inhabited is a mile long and 400 yards wide
 ganga nadi uske dakshin-purv mukh kii raksha karti he or varuna nadi uttar or uttar-purv mukhon kii raksha ek chhichhli khai ke rup main karti he, pashchim kii ore ek khaali naala he jisamen se hokar kisi samay varuna nadi bahati thi
 Given this natural means of defense, perhaps in ancient times this place was chosen for the city of Varanasi
 san 1857 i
 ke pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke samay angrejon ne bhi nagar raksha ke liye varuna ke peeche oonchi jameen par kachi mitti kii deevaaren uthaakar kilebandi kii thi
 The limit of Varanasi in the Puranas is much more than the length and breadth of Rajghat
 un varnanon se lagata he ki vahaan keval nagar kii seemaa hi nahin varnit he, balki puure kshetra ko sammilit kar liya gaya he
 The remains of ancient settlements are found far to the far side of Varuna
 atah sambhav he ki puraanon main mili varnan ve sab bhaag bhi aa gayi hon
 If we consider this area to be connected to the city, then the length and breadth of the city described in the Puranas is almost right
 gautam buddha ke janm purv mahajanapad yug main varanasi kaashi janapad kii rajdhani thi
 But it is difficult to estimate accurately about the expansion of ancient Kashi district
 jaatakon main kaashi kaa vistaar 300 yojan diya gaya he
 In the north of Kashi district was Kosal district, Magadha district in the east and Vatsa in the west
 itihaasavetta dow oltekar ke matanusaar kaashi janapad kaa vistaar uttar-pashchim kii ore 250 mile tak tha, kyonki iskaa purv kaa padosi janapad magadh or uttar-pashchim kaa padosi janapad uttar paanchal tha
 According to the Jataka, the boundaries of Kashi and Kosal were mixed
 kaashi kii dakshin seemaa kaa sahi varnan uplabdh nahin he, shaayad isaliye ki vah vindhyas shrinkhalaa tak gai hui thi va aage koi aabaadi nahin thi
 On the basis of the natives, the expansion of Kashi must have been extending from present Ballia to Kanpur
 yahaan shri rahul sankrutyaayan kehete hai, ki aadhunik banaras kamishnari hi pracheen kaashi janapad rahaa tha
 It is possible that some part of modern Gorakhpur Commissionerate has been included in Kashi district
 puru kul ke raja divodas dwaara duusari varanasi kii sthapana kaa ullekh mahabharat or anya granthon main aata he
 There is also a possibility of this city being in the baraunt
 is bare main pandit kubernath sukul ke anusaar bairaat khandhar baan ganga ke dakshin kinare par he vam par nahin
 In this way the stream of Ganges between Gomti and Bairant becomes a barrier
 ganga ke raste badalane, baan ganga main ganga ke bahane or ganga-gomti sangam saidpur ke paas hone ke bare main aage sukulaji ne mahabharat ke hawaale se bataaya he ki ganga-gomti sangam par markendeya tirth tha, jo vartmaan main kathi ke sameep sthit he
 Therefore, it can be said that if the ganga-gomti confluence was near Saidpur then it may have been pre-mahabharata and not after the third century AD
 varanasi shahar uttari bharat kii madhya ganga ghati main, bhartiya rajya uttar pradesh ke purvi chor par ganga nadi ke baayin ore ke vakrakaar tat par sthit he

 The ancient Aryans were not ignorant of the loss and gain due to the flow of rivers and land, and hence the population first came to Banaras

 Lowering of the Ganga's water level is also a major problem in Varanasi
