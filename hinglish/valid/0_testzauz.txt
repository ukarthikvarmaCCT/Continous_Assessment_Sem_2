 band jalsambar yaa samaavruth jalsambar bhugol main aise jalsambar kshetra ko kaha jaataa he jisamen varsha athwa pighalati barf kaa pani ekatrit ho kar kisi nadi ke zariye samudr yaa mahaasaagar main bahane kii bajaay kisi sarovar, daldali kshetra yaa shushk kshetra main jaakar vahin ruk jaataa he
 Normally, whatever water falls on the earth due to rain or snow, it flows from the highlands to the lowlands through rivers, Nehru and waterfalls
 yah chalate pani ke samooh ek-dusre se sangam karte rahete hai jab tak ke ek hi badi nadi na ban jaae
 Then this river later joins some ocean
 lekin jo kshetra sagaron se dhalaan, pahaado yaa registaanon kii vajah se pruthak hai vahaan par pani sab se nichle sthaan par pahunch kar ruk jaataa he
 At such places, either lakes are formed or the earth absorbs the water
 duniya kii sab se badi jhiilon main aise hi band jalsambharon kii vajah se bani hui kuch jhilein hai, jaise kii aral sagar or caspian sagar
 The closed watershed in English is called the "endorheic Basin"
 bhugolic drushti se aisa dekha jaataa he ke band jalsambar vaale kshetra praayah registani kshetra bhi hote hai
 This is because if the water keeps increasing at one place, then eventually the water defeats the barrier between itself and the sea
 vaigyanikon kaa anumaan he ke krishna sagar kisi samay par aisi hi ek band jalsambar kii jhil thi jo pani badhane se apni simaaon ko todakar bumadhya sagar se ja mili
 The salt and other substances which are found in the open watersheds later flow into the ocean
 band jalsambharon main aisa nahin hota
 Salt and other substances found in water accumulate in these lakes or dry areas
 isliye band jalsambar jhilein samay ke saath bahut khaari ho jaati hai
 Sambhar Lake, located near Ajmer in the Indian state of Rajasthan, is a saline lake of similar closed watershed
 aisi jhiilon par pradushan kaa bhi bahut bura asar padataa he kyonki pradooshak samudr main bah kar teetar-bitar hone kii bajaay ekatrit hokar badhate hi rahete hai
 The number of closed watersheds in different continents also differs due to their different geographical and seasonal conditions
 australia kaa lagbhag 21% kshetrafal band jalsanbharon kaa kshetra he jabaki uttar america main band jalsambar keval 5% kshetra par faile hai
 About 18% of the world's land area suffers from closed watersheds
 duniya ke sab se adhik kshetrafal vaale band jalsambar asia ke bhitari ilaakon main paae jate hai
 In some dry areas, closed watersheds bring salt and other salts, but evaporate rapidly due to heat and dryness
 kahin-kahin par pani keval ek hi mausam main bah kar aata he yaa kuch yogon tak bahane ke baad bhugolic paristithiyon ke badal jane se aana band ho jaataa he
 The thick and hard layer of salt in such dry lake areas forms a wide flat plain that stretches for miles and miles
 kyonki aise namak ke maidan bilkul samtal or bahut bade hote hai, inkaa prayog tej gadiyon dwaara gati kirtiman sthapit karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes the size of closed water reservoir lakes varies with the changing water flow with the seasons
 yah jhilein sookhe mausam main sikud jaati hai or barishon yaa himpat kii vajah se bad jaati hai
 Sometimes when the water is low, a lake gets divided into many small lakes and then after the rains the water rises and then it becomes a big lake
 agar kisi kshetra main aarthik vikaas ke saath pani rokane vaale band yaa sinchai ke liye naharen bana di jaaen jo band jalsambar jhiilon main pani kaa bahaav kam kar den, to aksar yah jhilein sikud kar bahut choti ho jaati hai
 In such a situation, those populations which depend on these lakes for their business or life have a very bad effect
 aisa hi kuch madhya asia ke aral sagar ke saath hua he

 ve hindi main aadhuniktaa ke pehle rachanaakaar the
 His original name was 'harishchandra', 'bharatendu' was his title
 unka kaarykaal yug kii sandhi par khadaa he
 He adopted the land of healthy tradition and sowed the seeds of innovation, leaving the nutritious practices of the perverted feudal culture of Reetikal
 hindi sahitya main aadhunik kaal kaa prarambh bharatendu harishchandr se mana jaataa he
 Bharatenduji, famous as the forerunner of the Indian renaissance, made the aim of his literature depicting the poverty, subjugation, inhuman exploitation of rulers of the country
 hindi ko raashtra-bhashaa ke rup main pratishthit karne kii disha main unhone apni pratibha kaa upyog kiya
 Bharatendu was rich in versatility
 hindi patrakarita, naatak or kavy ke kshetra main unka bahumoolya yogadan rahaa
 The beginning of plays in Hindi is believed to be from Bharatendu Harishchandra
 bharatendu ke naatak likhane kii shuruyaat bangala ke vidyasundar naatak ke anuwaad se hoti he
 Although plays were written even before them, Bhartendu strengthened the foundation of Hindi drama by regularly writing several plays in Khadiboli
 unhone 'harishchandra chandrika', 'kavivachansudha' or 'bala bodhini' patrikaon kaa sampadan bhi kiya
 He was an outstanding poet, strong satirist, successful playwright, conscious journalist and vigorous prose
 iske alaava ve lekhak, kavi, sampadak, nibandhkaar, evam kushal vaktaa bhi the
 Bharatendu ji wrote a huge literature at a young age of only thirty-four years
 unhone maatra or gunvattta kii drushti se itnaa likhaa or itani dishaao main kaam kiya ki unka samoochaa rachanakarm pathdarshak ban gaya
 Bharatendu Harishchandra was born on September 9, 1850 in a prestigious Vaishya family of Kashi
 unke pita gopalchandra ek achche kavi the or 'giradhardaas'upnaam se kavita likhaa karte the
 At the time of the first Indian freedom struggle in 1857, he would be 7 years old
 ye din unki aankh khulne ke the
 Bharatendu's work is evidence that once his eyes were opened, he did not stop
 unke purvaj angrej bhakt the, unki hi krupa se dhanwaan huye the
 Harishchandra was five years old, his mother died and ten years old, his father died
 is prakaar bachapan main hi mata-pita ke sukh se vanchit ho gayi
 Vimata tortured a lot
 bachapan kaa sukh nahin mila
 The system of education continued for the first time
 samvedansheel vyakti ke naate unamem swatantra rup se dekhne-sochane-samajhane kii aadat kaa vikaas hone laga
 His mind kept getting troubled by the content and method of studies
 queens college, banaras main pravesh liya, teen-chaar varshon tak college aate-jate rahe par yahan se man baar-baar bhaagta rahaa
 The memory power was intense, the eclipse ability amazing
 isliye parikshaon main uteern hote rahe
 In those days in Benares, English-educated and famous writer - King Shivprasad was 'starshind', Bharatendu used to go to his disciple
 unheen se angreji sikhi
 Bhartendu learned Sanskrit, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi, Urdu languages from Swadhyay
 unako kavy-pratibha apane pita se viraasat ke rup main mili thi
 He narrated to his father by making the following couplet at the age of five years and received the blessings of being a poet
 dhan ke atyadhik vyay se bhaaratendu ji rini ban gaye or duschintaaon ke kaaran unka sharir shithil hota gaya
 As a result, he died in 1885 at an early age
 bharatendu ke vrahat saahitiyik yogadan ke kaaran hi 1857 se 1900 tak ke kaal ko bharatendu yug ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, pandrah varsh kii avasthaa se hi bhaaratendu ne sahitya seva prarambh kar di thi
 At the age of eighteen, he brought out a magazine called 'kavikavasudha', in which the writings of the great scholars of that time were printed
 ve bees varsh kii avasthaa main onreri magistrate banaae gaye or aadhunik hindi sahitya ke janak ke rup me pratishthit hue
 She published 'kavikavasudha' in 1868, 'harishchandra Magazine' in 1873 and 'bala Bodhini' for women's education in 1874
 saath hi unke samaantar saahitiyik sansthaayen bhi khadi kin
 He founded the 'tadiya Samaj' to promote Vaishnava devotion
 rajbhakti prakat karte hue bhi, apni deshbhakti kii bhaavana ke kaaran unhen angreji hukumat kaa kopbhaajan bananaa padaa
 Impressed by his popularity, the scholars of Kashi conferred him the title of 'bharatendu' in 1880
 hindi sahitya ko bharatendu kii dein bhashaa tathaa sahitya donon hi kshetron main he
 In the field of language, he distinguished the form of Khadi dialect which is different from Urdu and has been enhanced by taking the juice of the dialects of Hindi region
 isi bhashaa main unhone apane sampoorn gadhy sahitya kii rachana kii
 Along with literature service, social service of Bharatendu ji also continued
 unhone kai sansthaaon kii sthapana main apana yoga diya
 He considered it his duty to help the afflicted, literate and friends
 pramukh nibandh Amazing dream ek kahani- kuch aapbeetee, kuch jagabiti It was the specialty of Bharatendu ji that where he wrote poems on ancient subjects like devotion to God, he also adopted new subjects like social reform, national love etc
 bhaaratendu kii rachanaaon main angreji shashan kaa virodh, swatantraaa ke liye uddaam aakanksha or jaateey bhavabodh kii jhalak milti he
 It was a new thing at that time to try to organize people for the spread of modern consciousness in a society stuck in feudal tightness
 unke sahitya or naveen vichaaron ne us samay ke tamaam sahityakaron or buddhijiviyon ko jhakzora or unke ird-gird rashtriya bhaawanaaon se ot-prot lekhakon kaa ek aisa samooh ban gaya jise bharatendu mandal ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to the subject, his poem is Shringar-dominated, Bhakti-dominated, social problem-oriented and national love-oriented
 shringaar ras pradhanbharatendu ji ne shringaar ke sanyog or viyog donon hi pakshon kaa sundar chithran kiya he
 See a picture of disconnection- bhakthi pradhanbharatendu ji krishna ke bhakt the or pushti maarg ke maanane vaale the
 He has a vision of true devotional spirit in the poem
 ve kaamana karte hai - Social problem Pradhan Bhartendu ji depicted many social problems in his poetry
 unhone samaaj main vyaapt kuritiyon par tikhe vyangy kiye
 They did not leave even the moneylenders and the bribe takers - raashtra-prem pradhanbharatendu ji ke kavy main raashtra-prem bhi bhaavana spasht drushtigochar hoti he
 They present the tableau of India's ancient glory in these words - prakritik chitranprakruti chithran main bhaaratendu ji ko adhik safalataa nahin mili, kyonki ve maanav-prakruti ke shilpi the, bahya prakruti main unka marmpurna roopen nahin ram paaya
 Hence, most of his nature depiction lacks the power to attract the human heart
 chandravali naatika ke yamuna-varnan main avashya sajivta he tathaa uski upamaayen or utprekshaayen naveenta liye hue hai- See this example of the nature description, in which the beauty of Yamuna is very visible
 bharatendu ke samay main rajkaaj or sambhraant varg kii bhashaa farsi thi
 At the same time, the dominance of English was also increasing
 sahitya main brajabhasha kaa bolbalaa tha
 Persian influenced Urdu also came into vogue
 aise samay main bharatendu ne lokbhashaon or farsi se mukt urdu ke aadhaar par khadi boli kaa vikaas kiya

 Not only the language, he incorporated new modern consciousness in literature and associated literature with 'jan'
 bharatendu kii rachanadharmita main doharaapan dikhataa he

 hindi bhashaa kii unnati unka moolmantra tha - In his testimony before the Education Commission in 1882, on the importance of making Hindi the language of the courts, he said- isi sandarbh main 1868 i main 'urdu kaa syapa' nium se unhone ek vyangy kavita likhi- Due to these works, Bharatendu became a grand constellation of Hindi literature and his era became known as Bharatendu era
 harishchandra chandrika, kavivachansudha, harishchandr megsine, stri bala bodhini jaise prakaashan unke vichaarsheel or pragatisheel sampadakeey drushtikon kaa parichay dete hai
 The most important work of Bharatendu is that he inspired Hindi literature, and with it, society to move in anti-imperial direction
 1870 main jab kavivachansudha main unhone lord mayo ko lakshya karke 'levi praan levi' naamak lekh likhaa tab se hindi sahitya main ek nayi samrajya-virdohi chetana kaa prasar armbh hua
 On 6 July 1874, he wrote in Kavibhasudha that in the same way as America became colonized and became independent, in the same way India can also gain independence
 unhone tadeey samaaj kii sthapana kii jiske sadsy swadeshi vastuon ke vyavhaar or videshi vastuon ke bahishkaar kii pratigya karte the
 The Swadeshi manifesto published in the 'kavikavasudha' dated March 23, 1874, by Bhartendu, appealing for the boycott of luxury clothes, became the pledge letter of the entire Hindi society
 usamen bhaaratendu ne kaha tha, First of all, Bharatendu Harishchandra gave voice to public sentiments and aspirations in literature
 pehali baar sahitya main 'jan' kaa samavesh bharatendu ne hi kiya
 His first poetry was dominated by ritualistic tendencies
 sahitya patansheel saamanti samskruti kaa poshak ban gaya tha, par bharatendu ne sahitya ko janata kii garibi, paradheenata, videshi shaskaon ke amanviya shoshan ke chithran or uske virodh kaa madhyam bana diya
 Through his plays, poems, reticent and slurs, he attacked and attacked the British Raj, due to which he also had to become a partisan of the British
 bhaaratendu angrejon ke shoshan tantra ko bhalee-bhaanti samajhate the
 In his magazine Kavikavasudha, he wrote - yahi nahin, 20veen sadi kii shuruyaat main dadabhai nauroji ne dhan ke apvahan yani dren of velth ke jis siddhanth ko prastut kiya tha, bharatendu ne bahut pehle hi shoshan ke is rup ko samaj liya tha
 she wrote - angrej bharat kaa dhan apane yahaan lekar chale jate hai or yahi desh kii janata kii garibi or kashton kaa mul kaaran he, is sachai ko bhaaratendu ne samaj liya tha
 In Kavikavasudha, he called upon the public - bharatendu kii vaishvik chetana bhi atyant prakhar thi

 isliye unhone san 1884 main baliya ke dadri meley main 'bharatvarshonnati kaise ho sakati he' par atyant sargarbhit bhaashan diya tha
 This article is also a reflection of his very progressive thinking
 isamen unhone logon se kuritiyon or andhvishwaason ko tyagkar acchhee-se-acchhee shiksha praapt karne, udyog-dhandhon ko viksit karne, sahyog evam ekta par bal dene tathaa sabhi kshetron main aatmanirbhar hone kaa aahvaan kiya tha

 bhaashan kaa ek chota sa ansh dekhie- This essay is a unique example of how clarity of ideas and how it can be presented with humor
 dekhie, kis tarah bharat kii chintaa is nibandh main bhaaratendu vyakt karte hai, In fact, his article is a kind of ideological extension of his play called Bharat Plight
 bharat durdasha main ve kehete hai, Bhartendu had understood well that 'english rule is for the benefit of Indians' This was a completely hollow claim and was propaganda
 angrej kis tarah bharat kii sampada lut rahe the, iskaa sanket bharatendu ne 'kavivachansudha' ke 7 march, 1874 ke ank main apni tippanee main diya, Bharatendu was such a great advocate of the equality of men and women that in the November 3, 1873 issue of 'kavikavasudha', he wrote, joguda pathak, almoda tehsil main bharat ke uttrakhand rajya ke antargat kumaun mandal ke almoda jile kaa ek gaanv he

 gandhi kaa mat tha ki agar bhartiya apane kapade khud banane lage, to yah bharat main based britishon ko aarthik jhatka lagegaa
 falswaroop, baad main charkha ko bhartiya rashtriya jhanda main shaamil kiya gaya
 apane saadhaaran jivan ko darshane ke liye unhone baad main apni baaki jivan main dhoti pahani Gandhi was born in Hinduism, most of the principles throughout his life originated from Hinduism
 saadhaaran hindu kii tarah ve saare dharmon ko samaan rup se maanate the, or isliye unhone dharm-parivartan ke saare tarkon evam prayaason ko asweekrut kiya
 He was knowledgeable of Brahm Gyan and read all the major religions in detail
 unhone hindu dharm ke bare main nimnlikhit baaten kahi hai- Gandhi has also interpreted the Bhagavad Gita in Gujarati
 Mahadev Desai has translated the Gujarati manuscript into English with additional role and description
 It was published in 1946 with the foreword written by Gandhi
 gandhi kaa maananaa tha ki prayek dharm ke mul main satya or prem hota he
 They say that 'see the Quran', 'bible', 'jend-avesta', 'talmud', or 'gita' by any means, we all have one God, and that is the true and loving nature
 dhong, kupratha aadi par bhi unhone sabhi dharmo ke siddhanton ke prati sawalia rukh akhriyaar kiya
 He was a tireless social reformer
 unki kuch tippaniyan vibhinn dharmo ke sandarbh main is prakaar hai : Later when asked if you are a Hindu, he said: ek duusare ke prati gaharaa aadar bhav hone ke baavjood gandhi or rabindranath thakur ek se adhik baar lambi bahes main lage rahe
 These debates reflect philosophical differences between the two
 ye donon hi us samay ke prasiddh bhartiya chintak the
 In the context of the horrific earthquake that struck Bihar on 15 January 1934, Gandhiji first said in a public meeting in Tinnevalli on 24 January 1934 that even if you call me superstitious, a man like me would believe that God punished us for our sins Have sent this terrible earthquake to give
 


 bihar kaa yah sankat to keval sharir kaa naash karne vaala he, magar asprishyata-janit sankat to hamaari aatma ko nasht kar rahaa he
 Therefore, we should learn from this catastrophe of Bihar that while remaining a few short breaths, we should get rid of this stigma of untouchability and enable ourselves to appear before our Creator with a clean heart
 25 janvari ko bhi unhone logon ko is ghatana ke sandarbh main asprishyata ko mahapaap maanakar tyaagane kii prerana di tathaa 26 janvari ko madura main vyapaariyon dwaara yojit swaagat samaaroh main unhone kaha ki mujhe to yah vishwaas hota ja rahaa he ki ham par yah vipatti asprishyata ke is mahapaap ke falswaroop hi ai he
 i request you not to laugh at my words and think that i am awakening your instinct of superstition
 main aisa kuch nahin kar rahaa hoon
 


 i may be called superstitious, but what i am feeling in the depths of my heart, i cannot live without telling you
 


 yadi aap bhi meri hi tarah is baat main vishwaas karte hon to aap nirnay karne main tatparta baratenge or yah maanenge ki aaj ham jaisi asprishyata baratate hai waisi asprishyata kaa vidhaan hindu shastron main nahin he
 You will agree with my view that to consider any man untouchable is a terrible sin
 manushya kaa ahankaar hi usase aisa kahata he ki vah anya logon se shreshth he
 Ravindranath Tagore, considering Gandhiji's idea to be indiscriminate by being able to promote superstition, wrote that the definite and only root cause of physical disasters is due to the sum of certain physical facts
 


 hamaare paap athwa trutiyaan chaahe kitni bhi bhayankar kyon na hon inamen itnaa bal nahin he ki sristi ke dhaanche ko tahas-nahas kar saken
 In response to this, Gandhi ji, while clarifying his perspective in detail, wrote that i have a lively belief in the interaction of natural phenomena and human behavior happening in the universe and because of that belief, i have come closer to God, i have humility and i have become more and more ready to present myself to God
 yadi main apane ghor agyaan ke kaaran us vishwaas kaa upyog apane virodhiyon kii ninda karne ke liye karuun to nishchay hi aisa vishwaas patankaaree andhvishwaas ban jaayegaa
 Instead of making an air debate on Gandhiji and making arbitrary conclusions, it is not only an age-old requirement but also a prudence to keep in mind the authenticity of the basis of Gandhiji's beliefs
 saamaanya se vishisht tak -- sabhi sandarbhon main dastaveji rup praapt gandhi ji kaa likhaa-bolaa praayah prayek shabd adhyayan ke liye uplabdh he
 So it is naturally necessary that in view of them, something should be taken to a proper stage
 likhane kii pravriti gandhiji main aarambh se hi thi
 Throughout his life he has written more than Vachik
 chaahe vah tippaniyon ke rup main ho yaa patron ke rup main
 In addition to writing many books, he also took out many magazines and wrote them well
 unke mahatvapurn lekhan kaary ko nimna binduon ke antargat dekha ja saktaa he: Gandhiji was a successful writer
 kai dashakon tak ve anek patron kaa sampadan kar chuke the jisame harijan, indian opinian, yang india aadi sammilit hai
 When he returned to India, he started a monthly magazine called 'navajivan'
 baad main navajivan kaa prakaashan hindi main bhi hua
 Apart from this, he wrote letters to individuals and newspapers almost everyday gandhi ji dwaara moulik rup se likhit pustaken chaar hai-- hind swaraj, dakshin africa ke satyagrah kaa itihaas, satya ke prayog, tathaa gita padaarth kosh sahit sampurna gita kii tikaa
 Gandhiji usually wrote in Gujarati, but translated or got his books translated into Hindi and English as well
 hind swaraj naamak alpakaay granthratna gandhiji ne england se lautate samay kildonon casil naamak jahaaj par gujarati main likhaa tha or unke dakshin africa pahunchne par indian opinian main prakashit hua tha
 The first twelve chapters in the December 11, 1909 issue and the remaining in the December 18, 1909 issue
 pustak rup main iskaa prakaashan pehali baar janvari 1910 main hua tha or bharat main bombay sarkaar dwaara 24 march 1910 ko iske prachaar par pratibandh laga diya gaya tha
 Gandhiji responded to this action of the Bombay Government by publishing an English translation of it
 is pustak ke parishisht-1 main pustak main pratipaadit vishay ke adhik adhyayan ke liye 20 pustakon kii suchi bhi di gayi he jisase gandhiji ke tatkaaleen adhyayan ke vistaar kii ek jhalak bhi milti he
 'history of South Africa's Satyagraha' originally started writing 'south African Satyagrahana History' in Gujarati on 26 November 1923 while he was in Yerwada Jail
 5 farvari 1924 ko reeha hone ke samay tak unhone pratham 30 adhyay likh daale the
 This history was published as an article in the 'navajivan' from 13 April 1924 to 22 November 1925
 pustak ke rup main iske do khand kramshah 1924 or 1925 main chape
 The first edition of the English translation by Valji Desai was published by S
 Ganesan Madras in 1928 and the second and third editions by Navjivan Prakashan Mandir, Ahmedabad in 1950 and 1961, with the required modifications
 aatmakatha ke mul gujarati adhyay dharawahik rup se 'navajivan' ke ankon main prakashit hue the
 It began with the publication of 'preamble' in the issue of 29 November 1925 and its completion from the last chapter titled 'purnahuti' in the 3 February 1929 issue
 gujarati adhyyon ke prakaashan ke saath hi hindi navajivan main unka hindi anuwaad or yang india main unka angreji anuwaad bhi diya jaataa rahaa
 Accordingly, the translation of 'preamble' was published in the 3 December 1925 issue of 'hindi Navajivan'
 hindi anuwaad main aatmakatha kaa pehla khand pustak ke rup main pehali baar sasta sahitya mandal, dilli se san 1928 main prakashit hua tha
 Navjivan Trust, the proprietor of Gandhiji's works, published his Hindi translation on his behalf in 1957
 shrimadbhagavadgita se gandhi ji kaa hardik lagaav praayah aaajeevan rahaa
 His contemplation and writing on the Gita also continued for a long time
 sampoorn gita kaa gujarati anuwaad, prastaavna sahit, unhone june 1929 main puraa kiya tha or 12 march 1930 ko navajivan prakaashan mandir, ahmedabad se 'anasakti yoga' naam se uskaa pustakaakaar prakaashan hua tha
 Its translation into Hindi, Bangla and Marathi was also instant
 angreji anuwaad iske baad janvari 1931 main sampann hua tha tathaa pehle yang india ke ank main prakashit hua tha
 Since the translation of each verse of the Gita was not easily comprehensible to the general readers, Gandhi ji wrote the expressions of each chapter of the Gita in a comprehensible way for the general readers
 yarvada central jail main 1930 or 1932 main prayek saptaah patr ke rup main ye bhav bhi narayandas gandhi ko bheje jate rahe taaki unhen ashram kii prarthana sabhaaon main padhe jaayen
 These were later published in book form named 'geeta-bodh'
 inke atirikt bhi unhone gita par prarthana sabhaaon main anek pravachan diye the
 Gandhiji's association with the Gita was such that despite his very busy life he prepared a syllabus for each verse of the Gita specifying the meaning of the verse as well as his place of use
 in samast samagriyon kaa ekatra prakaashan hi 'gita mata' ke naam se hua he
 The decision of the publication of a Granthamala by the Government of India for the publication of the complete and written literature of Gandhiji has undoubtedly been a historic step in the publishing world
 is granthmala kaa uddeshy gandhi ji ne din-prati-din or varsh-prati-varsh jo kuch kaha or likhaa us sabko ekatra karnaa tha
 Under this decision, the entire Gandhi Vaamya was published with the help of many learned scholars
 yah prakaashan teen bhashaaon main hua
 It has been published for the first time in 100 volumes in English and 98 volumes in revised form
 hindi main 97 khandon main tathaa gujarati main 70 khandon main yah prakashkeey mahakumbh sampann hua he
 Two additional features are also included in the entire Gandhi speech
 ek to yah ki prayek khand ke ant main aksharkram se shabdanukramanika di gayi he jisase adhyayan tathaa vibhinn kaaryvash punarawalokan main atyant suvidha ho gayi he; tathaa duusari yah ki prayek khand ke ant main gandhi ji kaa tareekhwar jivan-vrittant diya gaya he, jisase saraltapurvak ek nazar main gandhiji ke jivan kii sabhi mahatvapurn ghatnaon evam baton kii sankshipt jaankaree uplabdh ho jaati he
 In addition to this, the collection of selected pieces from Gandhiji's entire literature and small booklets focusing on different topics have also been published under different names
 inamen do sanchayan ati prasiddh tathaa atyupayogi rahe hai or in donon kaa prakaashan bhi gandhi ji ke jivan-kaal main hi ho gaya tha: Gandhiji has also interpreted John Ruskin's Unto This Last in Gujarati
 antim niabandh ko unka arthshaastra se sambandhit kaarykram kaha ja saktaa he unhone shaakaahaar, bhojan or swasthya, dharm, saamaajik sudhaar par bhi vistaar se likhaa he
 In 2000, a revised version of Gandhiji's entire work came under controversy as Gandhiji's followers accused the government of including changes for political purposes

 Due to this reason there was a dispute in India at the time of publication of the book, and the Legislative Assembly of Gandhi's home state of Gujarat prohibited the sale of this book through a resolution
 leliveld ke mutabik, unki pustak ke aadhaar par gandhi kii samalangi yaa dwillingi hone ke lagaae ja rahe aankalan galat hai
 He said, "this book does not say that Gandhi was gay or bisexual

 In Harijan on 6 October 1946, he wrote about the partition of India to create Pakistan: jaisaa kii muslim lig dwaara prastut kiya gaya gaiyr-islamic he or main ise paapyukt kehane se nahi hichakoongislam maanav jati ke bhaichaare or ekta ke liye khadaa he, na ki maanav parivaar ke eky kaa avrodh karne ke liye
is vajah se jo yah chaahate hai ki bharat do yuddh ke samoohon main badal jaae ve bharat or islam donon ke dushman hai
 They can cut me into pieces but cannot persuade me for something that i think is wrong, we should not give up, despite the fact that we should be able to keep Muslims in captivity of their love
 phir bhi, jaik homer gandhi ke jinna ke saath pakistan ke vishay ko lekar ek lambey patrachaar par dhyaan dete hue kehete hai- "haalaanki gandhi vaiyaktik rup main vibhaajan ke khilaaf the, unhone sahmati kaa suzav diya jiske tahat congress or muslim lig asthaayee sarkaar ke neeche samjhauta karte hue apni aazaadee praapt karen jiske baad vibhaajan ke prashn kaa faisla un jilon ke janamat dwaara hoga jahaan par musalamaanon kii sankhya zyada he

 Gandhi had also expressed his dislike for the partition of Palestine for the creation of Israel by partition at the end of 1930
 26 oktober 1938 ko unhone harijan main kaha tha: i received many letters in which i was asked to declare what i think about the persecution of Jews in Germany and arab-jews
 Not that i will be able to give my thoughts on this difficult question without hesitation
 My sympathies are with the Jews
 main unase dakshin africa se hi najdiki rup se parichit hoon kuch to jivan bhar ke liye mere saathi ban gaye hai
 It was through these friends that i came to know about the harassment that has been happening for a long time
 They have been untouchables of Christianity, but my sympathy does not exonerate me from the need for justice
 The call of a nation to Jews does not attract me much
 Whose approval was given in the Bible and the insistence with which they started wanting Palestine in their return
 kyon nahi ve, prithvi ke dusre logon se prem karte hai, us desh ko apana ghar banaate jahaan par unka janm hua or jahaan par unhone jivicoparjan kiya
 Palestinians belong to the Arabs, in the same way that the British inland and France the French
 It is unfair and inhumane to impose Jews on Arabs, whatever is happening in Palestine today cannot be vindicated by any code of conduct
 jo log hinsa ke jariye aazaadee hasil karnaa chaahate the gandhi unki aalochana ke kaaran bhi thodaa sa rajnatik aag kii lapet main bhi aa gayi bhagat singh, sukhdev, udam singh, raajaguru kii faansee ke kilaaf unka inkaar kuch dalon main unki ninda kaa kaaran bani
 To this criticism, Gandhi said, "there was a time when people used to listen to me how the British could be fought without arms because then there were no weapons
" 

par aaj mujhe kaha jaataa he ki meri ahimsa kisi kaam kii nahi kyonki isse hindu-musalamaanon ke dango ko nahi roka ja saktaa isliye aatmaraksha ke liye sashastr ho janaa chahie
" He made his argument in several articles, such as Homer's Jacques's The Gandhi Reader: a Source of His Writings and Life
 In 1938, when "anti-semitism and anti-semitism" was first written, Gandhi described the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 as a satyagraha
 He offered to use the method of non-violence for the hardships faced by Jews in Germany
 What happened agar main ek yahudee hota or germany main janma hota or apana jivicoparjan vahiin se kar rahaa hota to germany ko apana ghar maanata iske vaavjood ki koi sabhy german mujhe dhamkata ki vah mujhe goli maar degaa yaa kisi andhakupakaragaar main fank degaa, main tadipaar or matbhediye aacharan ke adheen hone se inkaar kar doongaa 
 or iske liye main yahudee bhaaiyon kaa intazaar naahe karuunga ki ve aayen or mere vaidhanik pratrodh main mujhase juden, balki mujhe aatmavishvaas hoga ki akhir main sabhi meraa udahaaran maanane ke liye baadhya ho jaayenge
 yahan par jo nuskhaa diya gaya he agar vah ek bhi yahudee yaa saare yahudee sweekaar kar len, to unki sthiti jo aaj he usase badtar nahi hogi
 or agar die gaye peeda ko ve swechhapurvak sah len to vah unhen andruni shakti or anand pradaan karegaa or hitler kii suvichaarit hinsa bhi yahudiyon kii ek saadhaaran nar sanhaar ke rup main nishkarshith ho tathaa yah uske atyaacharon kii ghoshnaa ke khilaaf pehla jawaab hogi
 agar yahudiyon kaa dimag sweyapurvak pidaa sahane ke liye tayar ho, meri kalpana he ki sanhaar kaa din bhi dhanyavad gyaapan or anand ke din main badal jayega jaisaa ki jihova ne gadhaa

 ek atyaachaari ke haath main apni zaati ko dekar kiya
 Those who fear God are not afraid of the terror of death
 gandhi kii in vaktavyon ke kaaran kaafii aalochana huyi jinka jawaab unhone "yahudiyon par prashn" lekh main diya saath main unke mitron ne yahudiyon ko kiye gaye mere apil kii aalochana main samachar patr ki do kartane bhejin do aalochanaayen yah sanket karti hai ki maine jo yahudiyon ke khilaaf hue anyaay kaa upaay bataaya, vah bilkul nayaa nahin he
 


 i only request that if one renounces violence from the heart, then in conclusion it will create a power through practice which is due to great sacrifice
 unhone aalochanaon kaa uttar "yahudee mitro ko jawaab" or "yahudee or philistin" main diya yah jaahir karte hue ki "maine hriday se hinsa ke tyaag ke liye kaha jisase nishkarshtah abhyaas se ek shakti srujit karegaa jo ki bade tyaag ki vajah se he
 Gandhi's statement about the imminent sacrifice of Jews attracted criticism from many commentators
 martin bubar, jo kii swayan yahudee rajya ke ek virdohi hai ne gandhi ko 24 farvari, 1939 ko ek tikshn aalochanatmak patr likhaa
 bubar ne dridhtaa ke saath kaha ki angrejon dwaara bhartiya logon ke saath jo vyavhaar kiya gaya vah naajiyon dwaara yahudiyon ke saath kiye gaye vyavhaar se bhinn he, iske alaava jab bhartiya utpedan ke shikaar the, gandhi ne kuch avasaron par bal ke prayog kaa samarthan kiya
 Gandhi referred to the persecution of Jews in Germany in 1930 within the Satyagraha
 navambar 1938 main uparavit yahudiyon ke naaji utpedan ke liye unhone ahimsa ke upaay ko sujhaayaa: It seems that there is no parallel in the history of German persecution of Jews
 The dictators of yesteryear have never been so mad as Hitler was and they do it with religious fervor that they are presenting a unique religion and war nation in whose name any inhumanity becomes the rule of humanitarianism, And will be awarded in future
 Clearly, the crime committed by an insane but fearless youth will fall upon the entire race with unbelievable ferocity
 If ever there is a just war in the name of humanity, then the war against Germany's brash oppression towards a Puri Kom is complete Can be said to be appropriate
 par main kisi yuddh main vishwaas nahi rakhata
 ise yuddh ke napha-nuksaan ke bare main charchaa mere adhikaar kshetra main nahi he
 But if war cannot be fought against such crime against Jews by Germany, then how can there not be an alliance with Germany, how can there be an alliance between such countries, one of which claims justice and democracy And the other one who has been declared the enemy of both? " gandhi ke dakshin africa ko lekar shuruaati lekh kaaphi vivadaspad hai 7 march, 1908 ko, gandhi ne indian opinian main dakshin africa main unke karagaar jivan ke bare main likhaa "kafir shashan main hi asabhy hai - kaidi ke rup main to or bhi

 "on the subject of immigration in 1903, Gandhi commented that" i believe that as much as they believe in the purity of their caste, we also 


 We believe that the white race in South Africa should be the best caste Should
 "during his time in South Africa, Gandhi repeatedly objected to the social classification of Indians with blacks, which he describes as" undoubtedly complete It is superior to the Kafirs "
 It is worth noting that the Kafir had a different meaning from the one currently being used in Gandhi's time
 These statements of Gandhi gave him an opportunity to accuse some people of being racist
