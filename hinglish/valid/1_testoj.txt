 Interpretation is the expression of any kind of waves of reciprocal processes, resulting in an increase, decrease, or indifference to vibrations and their effects in certain situations
 vyatikaran kaa vistrut adhyayan vishaal vibhedan shakti vaale sabhi yantron ke mul main kaam karata he
 Tomas Young incorporated this concept in physical optics
 unke baad vyatikaran kaa vyavhaar kisi bhi tarah kii tarangon yaa companon ke samavet yaa tajjanya prabhaavon ko vyakt karne ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 In short, the situation arising out of the collision of waves due to any kind of waveform is termed as interference
 jab kabhi jal yaa anya kisi drav kii sataha par do bhinn tarangasamooh ek saath milen to vyatikaran kii sthiti utpann ho sakati he
 Where the wavelengths of waves belonging to one waveform are incorporated by the wavelengths of the waves belonging to another chain, the elevation of the surface of the fluid is equal to the sum of possible elevations of the independent and solitary existence of the waves at that location
 jab tarangon main se ek ke tarangashring kaa duusare ke tarangagart par samapathan hota he, tab drav kii sataha par tarangon kaa udwelan kam ho jaataa he or pratifalit unnayan ek tarang avyav ke unnayan or duusare ke avanayan ke antar ke baraabar hota he
 The vibrations produced in a sound are a simple form of this interference, where two or more waveforms, with a slight difference in wavelength, are found moving in the same direction
 prakaash kii gat tarangeey hoti he
 The energy released from a single light source is disintegrated on the lateral side of the medium
 yadi prakaash ke do swatantra strot, jinase samaan pariman or abhinn kala kii tarangen satat ni:sruth hon, ek duusare ke sannikat rakhe jaaen, to madhyam ke aasapaas urja kaa vitaran samang nahin hota, jahaan ek prakashtarang kaa shrung duusare prakashtarang ke shrung par, yaa ek kaa tarangagart duusare ke tarangagart par girtaa he, vahaan aayam bad jaataa he or aayam swaroop urja yaa prakaash kii tivrata bhi bad jaati he
 Also, if the wavelength of one falls on the wavelength of the other, the resulting amplitude is zero and the intensity of light decreases
 pehali sthiti kaa samposhi vyatikaran or duusari sthiti ko vinashi vyatikaran kehete hai
 Thin bars of transparent solids and light bubbles on soap bubbles can give a clear introduction to interference
 jab prakaash kii kirane sabun ke bulabulon, yaa sise kii patale patton par padati hai, to unki bahari or bhitari donon satahon se kirane paravartit hokar prekshak kii aankhon kii ore lautati hai or prakaash ke tarangasamoohon main, jo donon sroton se aankhon tak pahunchati hai, kalaon main sookshm antar hone ke kaaran vyatikaran hota he, jisase utpann prabhaav kaaphi mohak ore chittkarshak hote hai
 a soap bubble is often seen covered with some black lines in a monochromatic light
 kaaran yah he ki kaale dikhaai padanevaale binduon par prakaash ke do tarangasamooh, jo kramash: bulbule kii bhitari or bahari satahon se aate hai, kareeb kareeb yaa purnat: ek duusare ke prabhaav ko nasht kar dete hai
 If the bubble is seen in white light, we usually do not see black lines
 unke sthaan par rangon kii pattiyaan hoti hai
 This is because different colors, the sum of which produces white light, are of different waves, so that interfering at a point of the bubble destroys only a fraction of the color and the remaining elements of the bright light remain
 , Which produce its full chromatic effect on the eyes
 vyatikaran ke liye kuch moulik sharte hai jinaki purti aavashyak he
 Some of these are inherent in the nature of light itself and other, if the result is to be observed by experiment, it becomes necessary
 saralata ke liye ham do vidyut chumbakeey laharon par vichaar kar sakate hai, jo kisi dikbindu par, jahaan se donon lehren guzarati hai, vinashi vyatikaran utpann karen
 If the pattern of interference remains constant, that is, if the resulting light intensity is zero for each value of time at the resulting so-called point, then the following conditions must be met: prakaash dwaara utpann pratirupon ke safal prekshan ke liye do anya sharten, jinaki purti honi chahie, nimnlikhit hai, If two superimposed light sources of equal magnitude and time lines meet at a point in a far-away curtain at a particular point of time, then some exactly lines on the screen with lines of maximum intensity in the gap are seen
 ve nunatam or adhiktam tivrata kii rekhaayen vyatikaran fringen kehalaati hai
 Whenever the fringe fringes are formed by thin films, they are caused by the change in the frequency of the rays participating in the fission
 yah parivartan film kii motaai ke parivartan, yaa aaytan kone ke parivartan, ke kaaran hota he
 If the thickness is not congruent, then often both facts become functional simultaneously; But one thing is clear that when a film is being watched by the eye, it is about 25 cm from the eye
 Should be kept at a distance of
 yadi film kaa paraas bahut bada na ho, to hamaari aankhon tak film ke vibhinn binduon se aati hui kirnon ke jhukaav kii bhinnata koi adhik nahin hoti or prayek kiran kaa aaytan kone kareeb kareeb samaan hota he
 Hence the fringes are formed mainly due to the variation of film thickness
 yah bhi nitant spasht he ki film ke un sabhi binduon par, jahaan motaai samaan he, vahaan prakaash kii dipti bhi samaan hogi
 If any such point is black or bright, the rest will be black or bright accordingly
 isliye kaali yaa ujwal pattiyaan samaan motaai ke film ke vibhinn binduon ke bindupath maatr hoti he
 Such fringes are called the Newtonian rings, because Newton first studied them

 machhliyon ke paale jane ke pramaan kam se kam 4,500 varsh purv tak ke praapt hue hai, jab sumer nivasee bhojan ke liye unhen haujon yaa pokharon main paalate the
 But it is possible that this practice has been prevalent even before this

 jaljivshalas do prakaar kii hoti hai : saarvajanik tathaa vyaktigat
 Public aquariums are established in many main cities of different countries
 neuyark, chicago, sinfrancisco, landan, berlin, ityadi nagaron main badi badi jaljivshalas hai
 Small, but well-known, aquariums are located in cities like Madras, Hawaiian Islands, Australia, South Africa, and Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore, etc
 in the United States

 Along with them, small livelihoods are also there for the public

 Maintaining the necessary heat and chemical composition of water is essential for taking care of public aquacultures and also resolving problems related to health, food, diseases and parasites of aquatic animals
 jahaan uchit prakaar kaa jal aavashyak pariman main sulabh hota he, vahaan mashiinon dwaara aavashyak jal kii purti saralata se hoti he
 Fresh water is mixed with municipal water reservoirs, but the residue of chlorine gas used to kill bacteria of this water is first isolated, as this gas damages the organisms of the reservoir
 yadi jalashay ke liye samudri pani aavashyak he, to samudr ke aise sthaan se jal lete hai jahaan nadiyon se ai hui, yaa anya prakaar se giranevaali, gandagiyaan na hon
 In such places, due to storms, water may be unfit for use, so in many places there is such a arrangement that once filled water in the Hauj keeps circulating, and the filtering and fitting operations are completed on the way

 chikitsa ke liy mukhyat: jeev ko aise vilyan main rakh dete hai jisamen usko koi haani na pahunche, kintu sankramak jeevanu mar jaaen
 If the water in the reservoir is not allowed to cool, then there is no special fear of diseases and parasites

 There is a false belief that stable aquatic flora is oxidized by the flora present in the above mentioned aquariums
 vastav main baat iske vipareet he
 Vegetation also takes oxygen from water and gives carbon dioxide at night, or on cloudy days, in the same way as aquatic organisms; But the presence of flora in these livestock has other advantages
 machhliyon tathaa anya jeevon ke sharir se jo mel ityadi nikalate hai ve vanaspatiyon ke liye khaad ke kaam aa jate hai or is tarah jal main gandagi nahin ekatrit hone paati
 Flora also enhances the beauty of the reservoir

 If the intermediate level of water and air in the reservoir is sufficiently wide, then this work is automatically performed
 yadi aisa nahin he, to sookshm bulabulon ke rup main pump yaa anya kisi upaay se jal ke bheetar se vaayu kaa nishkasana karana aavashyak hota he
 If the quantity of fauna and flora in any reservoir is balanced with the climate-mediated-level area, work can be done without special arrangement of air circulation
 machhliyon tathaa anya jalajantuon ko paalane ke sivaay inaki santanotpatti kii ritiyon kaa adhyayan bhi aakarshak vishay he

 The remaining food makes the water dirty
 machhliyon ko atyalp aahaar kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Therefore, there is a greater possibility of this mistake that instead of giving less food, more food should be given than required
 yah dhyaan rakhana sadaiv aavashyak he ki jalaashyon main utana hi bhojan daalaa jaae jitna khap sake
 The aforementioned principles for the maintenance of aquariums apply to all methods of fishing, whether small home shelters for decoration, or gardens, or the pools of fish that are fed for food
 lagbhag sabhi deshon kii sarkaron ne, saarvajanik jalaashyon main yathesht machhliyaan banaae rakhane ke liye, vishesh matsayshaalaaon main machhliyon ke rakhane, unke andon kaa sangrakshan tathaa bacchon ke paalane kaa prabandh kiya he
 Where possible, there is also a provision for hatching and raising children by keeping the eggs separate from the fish

 Carl David Andersen was a US physicist and 1936 Nobel Prize winner in Physics

 ko neuyark main hua
 He did his higher education at the California Institute of Technology, Passadana
 1930 main inhen pi

 In 1933, he was appointed assistant professor at the California Institute, then in 1939 he was made a professor
 anusandhan kaary - san 1927 main jin dinon aapane antariksh kirnon ke bare main apana shodhakarya aarambh kiya, un dinon in kirnon ke bare main is mahatvapurn prashn kaa hal dhunda ja rahaa tha ki ye kirane atyadhik urjawale kanon se bani hai athwa ye shaktishaalee gamma kirnon kii jati kii hai
 Under the inspiration of Professor Millikan, Andersen began his experiments according to a well-organized plan
 in prayogon main meghkaksh ko chumbakeey kshetra main rakhaa gaya tha or is baat kaa prabandh kiya gaya tha ki ek lambii avadhi tak prayek 15 second ke antar par kaksh main prakat honevaale vidyutkanon kii margrekha kaa photo apane aap khinchataa rahe
 By measuring the curvature of these path lines, Andersen unquestionably proved in 1932 that when the energy of space rays transforms into matter, an electron is produced as well as another particle of the same positive amount, called 'pazitron'
 Name is given
 pazitron kaa bhaar thik electron ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 In 1936, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of Pazitran
 inhen prayogon ke silsile main andersan ne is baat kii bhi sambhaavna batalaai kii antariksh kirnon main ek nai jati ke vidyutkan bhi vidyaman rah sakate hai jinka bhaar electron or proton ke bhaar ke bich hona chahie tathaa jinaki vidyut aavesh electron ke aavesh ke baraabar hi rinatmak yaa dhanatmak jati kii honi chahie

 The Directive Principles of State Policy are the latest elements of democratic constitutional development

 In 1951, the Supreme Court ruled that the elements were essentially subordinate to the fundamental rights
 Chamar Durai Rajan suit would not give priority to fundamental rights in case of a dispute, but when the state legislature started the abolition of zamindari
 In order to give effect to the Directive Principles of Article 39B, the Supreme Court recognized the importance of these elements and in Kameshwar Singh Vs
 From 1952 till 1957, the Supreme Court accepted that the Directive Principles of Policy cannot prevail on Fundamental Rights, but later the Court laid down the Harmony Principle and tried for collaborative development and tried to make both of them more effective
 As much as was possible
 hormoni siddhant dono ke madhya koi sangharsh nahi maan kar dono ko ek duusare kaa poorak maanata he
 According to this theory, if two interpretations are possible that balance the Directive Principles with the Fundamental Right, the second interpretation should be disputed in them, then the court should give priority to the first interpretation over the second interpretation if only one interpretation is possible and which policy - If there is a conflict between the rights, then the court is bound to abolish the 'privy purse' and give priority to the rights over the policy directors
 The Nationalization Act, which was brought for the compliance of Article 39 'B' and 'S', was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court for violation of fundamental rights, Parliament passed the 25th Amendment 1971 in response to this and Article 31 Gave birth to s which states that if a law is passed which gives effect to the Directive Principles of 39 b and in this process if paragraph 14, 19, anu 31 sa ke anusaar koi vidhi jo anu 39 ba sa ko prabhavi karti he kisi bhi nyaayalay me parakshit nahi kii ja sakegi

 This amendment was challenged in Minerva Mill vs Union of India suit in 1980, in which the Supreme Court declared the new amendment to Article 31 non-constitutional as it distorted the balance of parts 3 and 4 of the Constitution

 Concrete is a very suitable object for building bridges, because when it is in perfect shape, it can be filled anywhere and can be molded into any shape
 isliye pulon ke banane main iskaa bahut upyog kiya jaataa he
 Plain concrete has often been used to build bridges since ancient times
 anivaary rup se aisa pul kancreet kii mehrab kii akruti kaa hota tha
 In the 19th century in India, many bridges on hilly roads were built of lime concrete

 Another drawback is that it costs a lot to tie up the Dhola for the bridge
 19veen shatabdi ke ant main prabalit cement kancreet kaa prayog hone laga or tab se isamen teevr gati se pragati hui he
 Several methods have been developed to make bridges with reinforced concrete, the choice of which depends on the circumstances of the site
 mote hisaab se cement ke pul 13 pramukh prakaar ke hote hai
 Most of these can be made by many methods, which depend on the transverse shape of the bridge
 kisi vishesh sthal ke liye, sambhav he, purvonkt 13 prakaaron main se kai ek upyukt paae jaaen
 But in the end the choice of the bridge with the greatest efficiency, economy and confirmation is a very complex problem
 uchit chunaav ke liye, mote hisaab se gananaa karke anumaanon kii tulana kerani padati he
 The aforementioned 13 types and the stones for which they are suitable are as follows: 1
 ek paat kaa, dharan or pattawala athwa keval pattawala 20-40 feet 2
 kai daron kaa, dharan or pattawala athwa keval pattawala 20-40 foot 3
 One-rate scissor frame with bandage or joist and bandage with 15-30 feet 4
 kai daron kaa, kancheedaar chaukhate patt or pasliwaala athwa pattawala 20-40 foot 5
 Girder of variable inertia rotary 50-120 feet as required 6

 Ribbed arches and partially hanging floors 180-250 feet jaisaa upar bataaya gaya he, kisi vishesh sthaan par kai prakaar kii rachanaayen sthaneey paristhitiyon ke anusaar upyukt hongi
 The final decision rests on two causal groups
 pehle samooh ke kaarnon ko prakritik kaha ja saktaa he
 These are completely dependent on the location conditions, such as the foundation, quarry or other hull, the required free space above the bridge and the length of the bridge
 kaarnon kaa doosraa samooh vah he jisamen kritrim kaaran hon, yatha, pul par mahattam bhaar kitna padegaa
 What should be its width, its outline and its shape, and most important is its cost
 saadhaarant: anabaddh, ashrith sanrachana sabase mahangi padati he, yadhyapi isi kii abhiklpana saralatam he
 Where inflexible foundations can be found, the inflexible bridge is the cheapest

 There are three requirements for a satisfactory structure that must be met
 pratham yah ki yogya ejeeniyar pehle purna or borevar sanrachanaatmak aalekhan taiyaar kare
 Then, the material for making concrete should be carefully selected and thoroughly tested to ensure that it is as per the required properties and finally the work of the artisans is properly supervised
 uchit dekharekh or anupaaton ke niyatantran kaa mahatv isi se pratyaksh he ki kisi bhi vishesh anupaat kii kancreet kii pushtataa or tikaaupan saamagree ko bhalee prakaar milaane, uchit dhang se dhaalane tathaa thik tarah se kootane or phir use uchit reeti se niyamanusaar geela rakhane par hi nirbhar he
 It is necessary that the drum be made properly and completely hardened and the steel rods should be folded properly and the concrete should be kept in the proper place before casting

 The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the seven wonders of the ancient world listed by Hellenic culture, and described as a remarkable feat of engineering with a climbing series of tiered gardens with a variety of trees, shrubs and vines It resembles a large green mountain made of mud bricks, it was located near the Iraqi city of al-hilah
 is udyaan kaa nirmaan naboochadnejaar dwitiya ne isa se 600 varsh purv karavaaya tha
 This garden was completely destroyed in an earthquake 2 century BC

 It refers to trees planted on raised structures such as a roof

 There are five lead authors whose descriptions exist today that discuss the shape of the Hanging Garden, its overall design, and the means of irrigation, that "why it was built" Josephus describes the garden about Berossus, the Babylonian priest of Marduk Written, whose writings are the earliest mention of gardens around 290 BCE

 Quintus Curius Rufus probably arrived at the same sources as Diodorus

 Herodotus, who had described Babylon in his history, also did not mention the Hanging Gardens
 However, the gardens were said to exist even later when the authors described them, and some of these accounts were attributed to Babylon
 Is believed to be derived from people visiting

 rollinger ne suzav diya he ki borosus ne garden ko raajnneetik kaarnon se nebuchadnessar ko jimmedaar tehraaya tha, or unhone anya jagahon se puranic kathaon ko apanaaya tha
 One proposal is that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were actually built by the Assyrian king Sennacherib for his palace at Nineveh

 Kumbhandas lived in a village called "jamunavatau", some distance away from Mount Govardhan in Braj

 From his village, he used to go to Parsoli Chandrasarovar to do kirtan in Srinathji's temple

 Kumbhandas had seven sons, except Chaturbhajadas who were engaged in all agricultural activities

 He was completely disgusted and far from wanting money, honor, dignity

 But he was equally sorry for this, as expressed by his post- anumaanath: kumbhandas ji kaa janm govardhan,mathura ke sannikat jamunaavato naamak gram main samvath 1525 vikrami main caitra krishna ekadshi ko hua tha

 In the temple of Srinath ji, Kumbhandas started singing new verses regularly
 'pushti sampradaay' main sammilit hone par unhen kirthan kii hi seva di gayi thi
 Kumbhandas considered Bhagavatkripa to be paramount, even in the biggest domestic crisis, he never deviated from his path of faith

 Once, in the court of Mughal Emperor Akbar, a singer sang the post of Kumbhandas

 On opening his eyes, he asked his niece for posture and mirror, he got the answer that 'the posture was eaten, the mirror was drunk
 ' aashay yah tha ki pani main mukh dekhakar ve tilak karte the
 Maharaja Mansingh came to know of his poverty
 unhone sone kaa darpan dena chaha, bhagwaan ke bhakt ne asweekaar kar diya, moharon kii thili deni chaahi, vishwapati ke sevak ne uski upeksha kar di
 While walking, Mansingh wanted to name the village of Jambuwato Kumbhandas, but he said that "my work is done only by the curry tree and the plum tree
" " raja maansingh ne unki ni:sprihata or tyaag kii saraahna kii, unhone kaha ki "maaya ke bhakt to maine bahut dekhe hai, par vaastavik bhagavadbhakt to aap hi hai
 " vriddhavastha main bhi kumbhandas nity jamunaavato se shrinath ji ke darshan ke liye govardhan aayaa karte the
 One day he stopped near Anodar on the connecting rod
 'ashtchhaap' ke prasiddh kavi chaturbhujadas ji, unke chote putr saath the
 He told Chaturbhuj Das that "now what to do by walking home
" kuch samay baad sharir hi chhootane vaala he
 "gosain Vitthalnathji was present at the time of his death
 gosai ji ne poocha ki "is samay man kis lila main laga he?" kumbhandas ne kaha- laal teri chitwan chitai churaavai or iske anantar yugal swaroop kii chhavi ke dhyaan main pad gaaya- He left the body
 gosai ji ne karun swar se shradhanjali arpit kii ki aise bhagavdiy antardhan ho gayi
 Now the realization of the true Bhagavadkthas on earth was in fact a symbol of disinterestedness, an ideal of renunciation and penance, the ultimate Bhagavadiyya and the simple householder
