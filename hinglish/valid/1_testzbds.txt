 In an interview for a 1995 documentary The Celluloid Closet, screenwriter Gore Vidal forcefully states that he pressured Wyler to direct Stephen Wyd to create an indirect homosexual dialogue between Messala and Ben Harr
 Vidal states that he wanted to help explain Mesala's extreme reaction to ben-har's refusal to name his co-workers, the Jews, to a Roman officer, and suggested to Wyler that Mesala and ben-har were from childhood Gay had been a lover, but ben-hara later lost interest, thus revealing Messala's antipathy to his experience of rejection
 Since Hollywood's production code does not allow this, the idea was to be voiced by the actors, and Vidal suggested to Wyler to instruct Stephen Wyde to play the role in the same way, but not tell Heston

 There is no evidence to support Powell's claim and this is strongly refuted by director William Wyler, who suggests that the famous scene Neither a horse was injured nor a man
 The film's stunt director, Yakima Canut, stated that no serious injuries or deaths occurred during filming

 1936 main pazitron kii khoj ke upalaksh main aapako nobel puraskaar pradaan kiya gaya
 In connection with these experiments, Andersen also suggested that a new race of electromagnets could exist in space rays whose weight should be between the weight of electron and proton and whose electric charge was negative or equal to the charge of electron Should be of positive caste
 andersan ne inhen 'mesotron' naam diya
 Later these particles were called mesons

 Rolling describes Voldemort as "the worst wizard of hundreds of years"
 unhone use "atyadhik manorogi, anya logon kii pidaa par manushyik pratikriya kaa abhavi" ke rup main varnit kiya he
 At the same time, he has been shown to be the slayer of others, especially the Maghuls, because of his happiness

 Rolling also wrote that he was "a truly starving, racist of incredible strength"
 agar vah khwaish darpan main dekhtaa to vah swayan ko "sarvashaktimaan or avinashi" ke rup main dekhtaa jaisaa vah chahta tha
 Rolling also wrote that he was born as a result of a love decoction by his mother and sorceress Meropi Gaunt on a Magaloo and his father Tom Riddle, a result of a failed love

 Dumbledore has also stated that Voldemort is probably the smartest student of Hogwarts
 parantu voldemort main yah vilakshan pratibha tathaa kaushal hote hue bhi vah pyaar jaise shaktishaalee jaadu kaa saamana karne main ayogy tha; is samay koi shaktiyaan kaam nahin karti thi

 This equation is called because parity sign is used in it
 samta chinh ke baayin ore kriya karne vaale likhe jate hai tathaa iske daayin ore utpaada likhe jate hai
 The basis of the equation is that the number of atoms of different elements participating in a chemical reaction remains unchanged even after the reaction
 sabase pehle rasinic sameekaran dwaara rasinic abhikriya kaa nirupan san 1615 main jin beguin ne kiya
 Different types of signals are used to differentiate into different types of reactions
 kisi rasinic abhikriya ko santulit karne kaa arth he ki abhikaarakon or utpaadon ke nunatam purnank anuon kii sankhya likhnaa taaki rasinic abhikriya main jin sharton kaa paalan hota he, sameekaran main bhi un niyamon kaa paalan ho
 For example, see the following reaction- is abhikriya ko santulit karne kaa arth he, a, b, c, d, e ke nunatam purnank maan nikaalnaa taaki kisi bhi tatv ke liye sameekaran ke daaen paksh tathaa baayen paksh main aaye hue sabhi parmaanuon kii sankhya samaan ho
 The values of a, b, c, d, e etc
 can be done by simple calculation or by applying some basic rules
 kintu donon vidhiyaan samay lagaatin hai
 The method of doing this work methodically is by making simultaneous equations and solving them
 uparokt rasinic abhikriya ko santulit karne ki liye ham nimnlikhit yugapat sameekaran banaate hai- These equations are easy to understand
 uparokt abhikriya ke baayein paksh main sodium ke 2a parmaanu hai or daayen paksh main d parmaanu
 Hence 2 a = d { \ displaystyle 2a = d}
 isi tarah anya samikarnon ko samaj sakate hai
 After creating the equation, we see that the number of unknowns is 5 while the number of equations is only 4
 iskaa arth hua ki ham kisi ek agyaat raashi kaa maan apni icchaanusaar chunate hue aage bad sakate hai
 Suppose we put a = 2 { \ displaystyle a = 2}, then the values of the remaining unknown quantities will be: d = 4 { \ displaystyle d = 4}, e = 3 { \ displaystyle e = 3}, c = 2 { \ displaystyle c = 2} and b = 5 { \ displaystyle b = 5}
 sanyog se ye sabhi maan purnank hai
 But if we had moved with a = 1 { \ displaystyle a = 1}, the values of other unknown quantities would have been: d = 2 { \ displaystyle d = 2}, e = 3 / 2 { \ displaystyle e = 3 / 2} , c = 1 { \ displaystyle c = 1} and b = 5 / 2 { \ displaystyle b = 5 / 2}, which do not have many integers
 yadi sabhi maanon ko 2 se guna kar den to sabhi purnank ho jaayenge 
 Similarly, multiplying by 4, 6, 8,


 we will get integer values of all unknown quantities, but the value of the coefficients of the equation is considered to be a minimum integer
 1 se adhik nahin hona chahie
 Thus the balanced form of the above reaction would be: nai antarrashtriya arthvyavastha kii sthapana ke liye viksit or vikasshil deshon main uttar-dakshin samvaad kii shuruyaat hui
 But due to the expected and obstinate behavior of the developed nations, north-south cooperation could not be raised again
 vikashshil deshon par rinon kaa bhaar lagaataar badhane laga
 Most of the foreign aid they received began to be spent in payment of interest and international economic relations became more discriminatory and complicated
 vikasshil desh yah mahasoos karne lage ki uttar dakshin sahyog kii baat karnaa unke hiton ko koi phayda nahin pahunchaa saktaa
 Therefore, they should only talk about south-south cooperation
 isliye vikasshil deshon ne dakshin ke garib va alp-viksit deshon main hi sahyog ke aadhaar talashne shuru kar die
 This raised the slogan of south-south dialogue or cooperation
 dwitiya vishwayuddh ke baad vikasshil deshon ke liye ‘dakshin’ shabd kaa prayog kiya jane laga
 After 1945, the whole world was divided into two parts in political terms - North and South
 uttar main sabhi samrajyavaadee takatein yaa viksit dhani desh the
 In the 'south' there were poor countries who were victims of imperialist exploitation
 jab in deshon ne swatantrata praapt kii to inhen apane ko aarthik pichhadepan kii samasya se grast paaya
 The lack of economic means also came in the way of the discharge of independent international relations
 aisi sthiti main antarrashtriya sambandhon ko adhik prasangik banane ke liye inhone nai antarrashtriya arthvyavastha kii sthapana ke liye uttar ke deshon se udaar ravaiya apnaane kaa aagrah kiya or iske parinamswaroop uttar-dakshin sahyog ke prayaas shuru hue
 But due to the lack of positive results, developing countries started mutual cooperation rather than cooperation with developed countries
 iske liye aapasi vichaar-vimarsh kii prakriya shuru hui arthath dakshin-dakshin samvaad kaa janm hua
 This led to intensification efforts in developing countries
 vikasshil deshon ko dakshin-dakshin samvaad kii prakriya dwaara aatmanirbhar banane tathaa unki viksit deshon par nirbharta kam karne kii prakriya dakshin-dakshin sahyog ke naam se jaani jaati he
 south-south cooperation has resulted in a new era in developing countries
 iske antargat takneekee aadan-pradaan kii prakriya tej hui
 Extremely backward nations also took advantage of this to join the ranks of more developing countries
 aaj dakshin-dakshin sahyog antarrashtriya sambandhon ko prabhavit karne vaala pramukh tatv he
 The beginning of south-south cooperation is considered from the 1968 UNCTAD conference
 iske baad 1970 main lusaaka sammelan main bhi isaki aavashyaktaa par bal diya gaya
 In the special session convened by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1974, it was particularly mentioned in the call for a new international economy
 1976 main gutnirpeksh sammelan tathaa chauthe ankatad sammelan main vikasshil deshon ke aapasi vyapaar tathaa samuhik anternirbharta kii aavashyaktaa par bal diya gaya
 It was also mentioned at the Caracas Conference in 1981

 To overcome this lack, the Hindustani Language Academy has been formed
 hindustani bhashaa academy bharat kii aisi sanstha he jo hindi samet abhi hindustani bhashaaon ke vikaas evam prachaar prasar ke liye nirantar kaary kar rahi he | sanstha ek ek hindustani bhashaa ko uskaa darja va unka samuchit adhikaar dilwane hetu katibaddh he hindustani bhashaa academy desh ke vibhinn jimmedaar vyaktiyon or adhikranon ke saath samvaad sthapit kar rahi he taaki hindustani bhashaaon ke raste main ai rukaawato dur kar ise vaishvik chunautiyon ke liye taiyaar kiya jaae | If we look at the past years of history, we will see that what has been lost by humans the most is the creative mind, the meaning of being creative, if it is applied properly, it is to be positive and to be positive means to have a creative attitude towards life

 Keeping this main objective in mind, we have formed the 'hindustani Bhasha Academy' in the national interest
 Every member involved in this institution has been working at different levels in different languages of the country through various institutions / forums for a long time
 Many of our colleagues have been trying to pressurize the government through various movements for long to make Hindi the national language, but we believe that this effort to make any language a national language is inadequate and We have to do concrete work at the ground level for this
 sarvapratham aavashyaktaa is baat kii he ki desh kii jo bhi rashtrabhasha bane uski sweekaaryata puure raashtra main hone chahie or iske liye sarvapratham use desh kii sampark bhashaa bananaa hoga | jis prakaar maatr patton par pani daalane se kisi ped kii jaden majboot nahin ho sakati, thik usee tarah maatr aandolan se kuch hone vaala nahin he | ham apane uddeshy main tabhi safal ho sakate he jab samasyaon ko uthaane ke saath-saath unka samaadhaan ke saath apana paksh majbootee se rakhenge | aaj aavashyaktaa he ki kshetreey bhashaaon va sarvamaan boliyon kaa parikshan, sanvardhan or vikaas kiya jaaen | unase hindi ke shabd grahan ke liye tantra kaa nirmaan kiya jaae or takneekee shabdaawalee viksit kii jaae | hindi sahit sabhi prantiy bhashaaon ke sahitya kaa anuwaad kiya jaae or maanak shabd kosh kaa nirmaan kiya jaae | isse bhartiya bhashaaon main aapasi saamanjasy, sahishnutaa, sammaan or sauhaard badhegaa or ek duusare ke sahitya ko padhne or samajhane kaa avasar milegaa | meraa maananaa he in sab kaaryo se sampark bhashaa ke rup main hindi kii sweekruti badhegi, saath hi sarkaar ko sahyog or bhashaai sauhadra ko badhaane main bhi madad milegi | We have no hesitation in assuming that due to no concrete work on Hindi and due to the movements and revolutions in the name of language, its rejection of Hindi language has increased in other languages and non-hindi speaking provinces
 Our opinion is that politics can be done only through linguistic bigotry but it cannot be accepted
 In view of the geographical and political environment of the whole of India, it is not possible to create a national language without proper acceptance of any language in the entire nation, if any such effort is made, then in the same way as India is caste-religion and politically Looks divided, a similar threat may come in the name of language in the future
 Undoubtedly, Hindi is the most spoken language in India today, All that is needed is that its acceptance should be in the entire nation and it should become the contact language of India in place of English
 The day we succeed in making it a contact language, no one will stop it from becoming the national language of the country and it will also get the support of the provincial languages
 The only goal of the 'hindustani Bhasha Academy' is to make India the highest language in the world by threading the various languages of the country

 maharaja surajmal bharatpur rajya ke doordarshee ] the
 His father Badan Singh made Deeg his capital first and later Surajmal founded the city of Bharatpur
 surajmal ne san 1733 main khemkaran sogriyaa kii fatahgadhi par akraman kiya or vijay praapt kar yahan 1743 main bharatpur nagar kii neenv rakhi jo san 1753 se unka nivas hua
 Maharaja Suraj Mal was politically intelligent, visionary, handsome, shapely and healthy
 unhone jaipur ke maharaja jaisingh se bhi dosti bana lee thi
 Jaisingh died on 21 September 1743, and soon thereafter a fight ensued over his sons Ishwari Singh and Madhosingh
 maharaja surajmal bade bete ishwari singh ke paksh main the jabaki udaipur ke maharana jagat singh madhosingh ke paksh main the
 Later in Jahazpur the two brothers fought and Ishwari Singh won in March 1747
 ek saal baad may 1748 main peshwaon ne ishwari singh par dabaav daalaa ki wo maadho singh ko chaar pargana saunp de
 Then Marathe, Sisodia, Rathore, Vagira, the armies of the seven kings joined with Madhosingh and Ishwari Singh fell alone
 In 1753, Maharaja Suraj Mal captured Firoz Shah Kotla
 dilli ke nawab gaji-ud-deen ne phir maraathon ko surajmal ke khilaaf bhadakaayaa or phir maraathon ne janvari 1754 se may 1754 tak bharatpur jile main surajmal ke kumher kile ko ghere rakhaa
 The Marathas could not capture the fort and in that battle, Khande Rao Holkar, son of Malhar Rao was killed
 maraathon ne surajmal kii jaan lene kii thaan lee thi par maharani kishori ne sindhiyaaon kii madad se marathaon or surajmal main sandhi karvaa di
 According to Vendel, Jat power emerged as a dominant power in northern India during this period of shabby Mughal power
 savai jaisingh kii mrityu ke baad san 1748 ke uttaradhikaar yuddh main maraathon or rajputon sahit saat raajaaon kii shakti ke viruddh kamjor parantu sahi paksh ko vijayshri dilaakar surajmal ne jat-shakti kii shreshthata siddh kii
 At the same time, there was no campaign of Mughals in which jat-shakti was not invited for cooperation
 vajeer safadarajang to purnroop se apane mitra surajmal kii shakti par avalambit tha
 The combined power of maratha-mughal-rajputs under the leadership of the deposed Meerbakhshi Ghaziuddin Khan of the deposed Wazir Safdarjung could not conquer even Kumher, the small fort of Surajmal in 1754
 san 1757 main najibuddaula dwaara aamantrit abdali bhi apane amanviya narsanhaar se surajmal kii shakti ko dhwast nahin kar sakaa
 The traitor Najib then invited Abdali to invade Hindustan in 1759 to escape the wrath of the then Wazir Ghaziuddin Khan and the Marathas
 panipat ke antim yuddh se purv baraari ghat ke yuddh main maraathon kii pratham paraajay ke baad surajmal ke kattar shatru vajeer gajiuddinkhan ne bhi bhagkar jaaton ke samaksh aatmasamarpan kar diya tha
 According to Wendell, 'such a harsh and so precise defeat of Mughal arrogance had never happened before'
 vastutah mughal satta kaa garvila or bhayaavah daitya dharashayi ho chukaa tha jiske avasheshon par maharaja surajmal ke netritv main vilaas or aadambar se dur, karmanya, shauryaparayan, nirbal kii sahaayak, sharnaagat kii rakshak, prajavatsal, hindu-muslim ekta kii pratik, rashtravaadi jat-satta kii sthapana hui
 Later in 1760, there were some differences between Sadashiv Rao Bhau and Suraj Mal
 mathura kii nabi masjid ko dekhakar bhaau ne gusse main kaha - surajmal ji, mathura itane din se aapke kabje main he, phir is masjid ko aapane kaise chhod diya? surajmal ne jawaab diya - agar mujhe yakeen hota ki main sari umr is ilaake kaa badshaah rahoonga to shaayad main is masjid ko girava detaa, par kya phayda? kal musalmaan aakar hamaare mandiron ko giravaayen or vahiin par masjiden banavaa den to aapako acha lagegaa? baad main phir bhaau ne laal kile ke diwane-khaas kii chat ko girwane kaa hukum diya tha, yah soch kar ki is sone ko bechakar apane sainikon kii tankhwaah de duungaa
 On this too Surajmal refused him, even said that take five lakh rupees from me, but do not break it, after all Nadir Shah had also spared this roof
 par bhaau nahin mana - jab chat kaa sona todaa gaya to vah mushkil se teen lakh rupee kaa niklaa
 Bhau did not listen to many things about Surajmal and also said that - i have not come here from far south on the strength of your strength
 14 janvari 1761 main panipat kii teesri ladaai maraathon or ahmedshah abdali ke bich hui
 More than half of the one lakh soldiers of the Marathas were killed
 maraathon ke paas na to puraa rashan tha or na hi is ilaake kaa unhen bhed tha, kai-kai din ke bhukhe sainik kya yuddh karte ? agar sadashiv raav maharaja surajmal se choti-si baat par takaraar na karke use bhi is jang main saajheedaar banaata, to aaj bharat kii tasviir or hi hoti| maharaja surajmal ne phir bhi dosti kaa haq adaa kiya
 When thirty-forty thousand Marathas started going back after the war, they had a bad condition while reaching the area of surajmal
 jakhmi haalat main, bhukhe-pyaase ve sab marane ke kagaar par the or upar se bhayankar sardi main bhi mare, aadhon ke paas to oonee kapade bhi nahin the
 For ten days, Surajmal took him to Rakha in Bharatpur, administered his medicine and arranged food and clothes
 maharani kishori ne bhi janata se apil karke anaaj aadi icttha kiya
 It is heard that some twenty lakh rupees were spent in their service and water
 jate hue har aadmi ko ek rupaya, ek ser anaaj or kuch kapade aadi bhi diye taaki raste kaa kharch nikaal saken
 Some Maratha soldiers had also brought their families before the fighting and left them in the villages of Haryana
 unki maut ke baat unki vidhwaaen waapas nahin gayi
 Later, the family rode into the culture of Haryana
 maharashtra main 'daange' bhi jatvansh ke hi bataaye jate hai or haryana main 'dangi' bhi unheen kii shakha he
 After the fall of the Marathas, Maharaja Suraj Mal also won the areas of Ghaziabad, Rohtak, Jhajjar
 1763 main farukhnagar par bhi kabja kiya

 raajnneeti praveshdwar The Federal Syrian Court or the Wafqi Sharai Adalat is a judicial institution in Pakistan, whose task is to investigate and determine whether the laws of the country follow Sharia

 In the nineteenth century, the prose of Hindi prose-making and the Hindi-propaganda movement, despite facing severe hardships under the most adverse conditions, the evidence of how fast and athletic it is is evident on the dilapidated pages of 'bharatamitra' 'saar Sudhanidhi' and 'proper speaker' 
 vartmaan main hindi patrakarita main angreji patrakarita ke dabadabe ko khatm kar diya he
 Earlier, English journalism dominated the country and abroad, but today the flag of Hindi language is waving
 30 may ko 'hindi patrakarita diwas' ke rup main manaaya jaataa he
 Modern-day journalism was born in India in the fourth phase of the eighteenth century in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras
 1780 i
 main prakashit hike kaa "kalakatta gazat" kadachit is ore pehla praytn tha
 anglo-indian English journalism of these cities had developed greatly by the time the first Hindi letter Udant Martand was published
 in antim varshon main farsi bhashaa main bhi patrakarita kaa janm ho chukaa tha
 Persian letters of the 18th century were probably handwritten letters
 1801 main 'hindostaan intelligence oriental anthology' naam kaa jo sankalan prakashit hua usamen uttar bharat ke kitne hi "akhabaaron" ke uddhran the
 In 1810 Maulvi Ikram Ali started publishing the Leitho letter "hindostani" from Calcutta
 1816 main gangakishor bhattacharya ne "bengal gajet" kaa pravartan kiya
 This was the first Bengali letter
 baad main shrirampur ke padariyon ne prasiddh prachaarpatr "samachar darpan" ko janm diya
 After these initial letters, in 1823, we get to see 'newschandraika' and "samvad Kaumudi" in Bengali language, "jame Jahanuma" and "shamsul Akhbar" in Persian Urdu and "mumbai Samachar" in Gujarati
 yah spasht he ki hindi patrakarita bahut baad kii cheez nahin he
 Delhi's "urdu Newspaper" and Marathi's "digdarshan" came only after Hindi's first letter "udant Martand"
 "udant martand" ke sampadak pandit jugalkishor the
 It was a weekly paper
 patr kii bhashaa pachhanhi hindi rahati thi, jise patr ke sampadakon ne "madhyadeshiy bhashaa" kaha he
 The letter closed in 1827
 un dinon sarkari sahaayta ke bina kisi bhi patr kaa chalanaa asambhav tha
 The company government had given the facility of postage etc
 to the missionaries' letter, but even after trying, "udant Martand" could not get this facility
 1826 i
 se 1873 i
 tak ko ham hindi patrakarita kaa pehla charan kah sakate hai
 In 1873, Bhartendu founded the "harishchandra Magazine"
 ek varsh baad yah patr "harishchandra chandrika" naam se prasiddh hua
 By the way, Bhartendu's "kavyashakha Sudha" paper came out in 1867 itself and he took an important part in the development of journalism; But the new language style was introduced in 1873 only from "harishchandra Magazine"
 is bich ke adhikansh patr prayog maatr kahe ja sakate hai or unke peeche patrakala kaa gyaan athwa nae vichaaron ke prachaar kii bhaavana nahin he
 The major letters after "udant Martand" are: in patron main se kuch masik the, kuch saptahik
 The daily paper had only one "news Corruption" which was bilingual and published from Calcutta
 yah dainik patr 1871 tak chalata rahaa
 Most of the letters were published from Agra which was a big educational center in those days and the students met the needs of the society
 shesh brahmsamaj, sanathan dharm or mishnariyon ke prachaar kaary se sambandhit the
 Many of the letters were bilingual and some were even bilingual
 isse bhi patrakarita kii aparipakv dasha hi suchit hoti he
 The "banaras Newspaper" was very influential in the early letters of Hindi Pradesh and in protest against its linguistic language, Taramohan Maitra started publishing the weekly "sudhakar" from Kashi in 1850 and Raja Lakshman Singh from Agra in 1855 from Prajitha
 raja shivaprasad kaa "banaras akhbaar" urdu bhashastyli ko apanaataa tha to ye donon patr panditau tatsampradhan style kii ore jhukate the
 Thus we see that before 1867 Hindi journalists could not follow a certain style in relation to the language style
 is varsh 'kavi vachansudha' kaa prakaashan hua or ek tarah se ham use pehla mahatvapurn patr kah sakate hai
 At first it was monthly, then fortnightly and finally weekly
 bharatendu ke bahuvidh vyaktitv kaa prakaashan is patr ke madhyam se hua, parantu sach to yah he ki "harishchandra magazine" ke prakaashan tak ve bhi bhashastyli or vichaaron ke kshetra main maarg hi khojate dikhaai dete hai
 The second era of Hindi journalism runs from 1873 to 1900
 is yug ke ek chor par bharatendu kaa "harishchandra magazine" tha ore nagariprachaarini sabha dwaara anumodanprapt "saraswati"
 The number of papers published in these 27 years is above 300-350 and extends to Nagpur
 adhikansh patr masik yaa saptahik the
 The monthly papers used to have some more permanent assets in the form of essays, Naval Katha, talks etc
, but most of the papers did not go more than 10-15 pages and we can call them "thought sheets" in today's words
 saptahik patron main samaacharon or unpar tippaniyon kaa bhi mahatvapurn sthaan tha
 In fact, there was no special request for the daily news at that time and perhaps that's why the weekly and monthly papers were more important in those days
 unhone janajagran main atyant mahatvapurn bhaag liya tha
 The ideal of these 25 years of the nineteenth century was Bharatendu's journalism
 "kavivachansudha", "harishchandra magazine", shri harishchandra chandrika", balbodhini ke rup main bharatendu ne is disha main pathpradarshan kiya tha
 Frustrated by his commentaries, and angry at the "punch" of "kavikhaवचनasudha", the magistrate of Kashi also stopped taking Bharatendu's letters to the education department
 isamen andeh nahin ki patrakarita ke kshetra bhi bharatendu purnataya nirbhik the or unhone nae nae patron ke liye protsaahan diya
 He also named many letters like "hindi Pradeep", "bharat Jeevan"
 unke yug ke sabhi patrkaar unhen agrani maanate the

 Critical literary review started from this magazine and hence we can consider it a definite lighthouse
 1900 i
 main "saraswati" or "sudarshan" ke avataran ke saath hindi patrakarita ke is duusare yug par patakshep ho jaataa he
 In these 25 years, Hindi journalism developed in many directions
 praarambhik patr shikshaprasar or dharmprachaar tak simit the
 Bharatendu also developed social, political and literary directions
 unhone hi "balabodhini" naam se pehla stri-masik-patr chalaaya
 a few years later, women see themselves entering the region - "bharatabhini", "sugrihini"
 in varshon main dharm ke kshetra main aryasamaj or sanathan dharm ke prachaarak vishesh sakriy the
 Some letters related to Brahmasamaja and Radhaswami faith and some Christian religious letters from Christian centers like Mirzapur also appear, but we find the religious reactions of the era only in the letters of Aryasamaj and mythology
 aaj ye patr kadachit utane mahatvapurn nahin jaan padate, parantu isamen andeh nahin ki unhone hindi kii gadhyshailee ko pusht kiya or janata main nae vichaaron kii jyoti bhi
 As a result of these religious debates, various sections of the society and sect went towards reform and very soon there was a flood of communal letters
 saikadon kii sankhya main vibhinn jaateey or vargeey patr prakashit hue or unhone asankhya janon ko vaani di
 Today, the same letters are very important in our historiography, who have done some outstanding work in the field of language style, literature or politics
 saahitiyik drushti se "hindi pradeep", brahman, kshatriyapatrika, anandakadambini, bharatendu, devanagari prachaarak, vaishnav patrika, kavi ke chitrakaar, nagari nirad, sahitya sudhanidhi or raajnneetik drushti se bharatamitra, uchit vaktaa, saar sudhanidhi, bharatoday, bharat jivan, bharatoday, shubhachintak or hindi bangavasi vishesh mahatvapurn hai
 These papers have preserved the best of our 19th-century literature, rasikas, karmat worshipers of Hindi, stylists and thinkers
 yah kshobh kaa vishay he ki ham is mahatvapurn saamagree kaa patron kii filon se uddhaar nahin kar sake
 How many essays, commentaries, articles, panches, haps and sketches and sketches of living writers like Balakrishna Bhatt, Pratapnarayan Mishra, Sadanam Mishra, Rudradatta Sharma, Ambikadatta Vyas and Balamukund Gupta are getting us to the mark today
 aaj bhi hamaare patrkaar unase bahut kuch sikh sakate hai
 He was a pioneer in his time
 beesvin shatabdi kii patrakarita hamaare liye apekshaakrit nikat he or usamen bahut kuch pichley yug kii patrakarita kii hi vividhta or bahurupata milti he
 Journalists of the 19th century had to face chaos in the language-style arena
 unhen ek ore angreji or duusari ore urdu ke patron ke saamne apni vastu rakhni thi
 Right now the people interested in Hindi were very small
 dhire-dhire paristhiti badali or ham hindi patron ko sahitya or raajnneeti ke kshetra main netritv karte pate hai
 From this century onwards, the movement of religion and social reforms fell behind and the caste consciousness gradually assumed the form of national consciousness
 falat: adhikansh patr, sahitya or raajnneeti ko hi lekar chale
 The first two decades in the field of literary papers were led by "saraswati" edited by Acharya Dwivedi
 vastut: in bees varshon main hindi ke masik patr ek mahaan saahitiyik shakti ke rup main saamne aae
 a number of papers were published in the form of a novel novel Kahani - such as Novel 1901, Hindi Naavil 1901, Novel Lahari 1902, Novel Sea 1903, Novel Kusumnjali 1904, Novel Bahar 1907, Novel Promotion 19012
 keval kavita athwa samasyapurti lekar anek patr unnisvin shatbdi ke antim varshon main nikalne lage the
 They went on
 samalochna ke kshetra main "samalochak" or aitihaasik shodh se sambandhit "itihaas" kaa prakaashan bhi mahatvapurn ghatnaayen hai
 But Saraswati's ideal as "missleni" was more popular and a few letters can be named with him in the letters of this category, such as "bharatendu", Nagri Hitaishini Patrika, Bankipur, Nagrikaprakash, Mithilamihir and Indu
 "saraswati" or "indu" donon hindi kii sahityachetana ke itihaas ke liye mahatvapurn hai or ek tarah se ham unhen us yug kii saahitiyik patrakarita kaa sheershamani kah sakate hai
 Through "saraswati", Acharya Mahavirprasad Dwivedi and "indu" through Pandit Rupnarayan Pandey, the editorial vigilance, perseverance and honesty that he set before us was able to give a new direction to Hindi journalism
 parantu raajnneetik kshetra main hindi patrakarita ko netritv praapt nahin ho sakaa
 The center of political journalism of the previous era was Calcutta
 parantu kalakatta hindi pradesh se dur padataa tha or swayan hindi pradesh ko raajnneetik disha main jaagruk netritv kuch der main mila
 The first daily Hindi Hindi state of Raja Rampal Singh's bilingual "hindustan" was published in English and Hindi from Kalakankar
 do varsh baad, babu seetaram ne "bharatoday" naam se ek dainik patr kanpur se nikaalnaa shuru kiya
 But both these papers could not be long lasting and the weekly papers had to become the vehicle of political ideology
 vastav main unnisvin shatbdi main kalakatta ke bharat mitra, vangvasi, sarasudhanidhi or uchit vaktaa hi hindi pradesh kii ranithik bhaavana kaa pratinidhitiv karte the
 Perhaps "bharatamitra" was the most enduring and powerful of these
 unnisvin shatabdi main bengal or maharashtra lok jagrati ke centre the or ugr rashtriya patrakarita main bhi ye hi praant agrani the
 The journalists of Hindi Pradesh accepted the leadership of these provinces and their independent political personality could not develop for a long time
 phir bhi ham "abhyuday", "pratap", "karmyogi", "hindi kesari" aadi ke rup main hindi raajnneetik patrakarita ko kai dag aage badhaate pate hai
 The excitement of the First World War once again led to several daily letters
 kalakatta se "kalakatta samachar", "swatantra" or "vishwamitra" prakashit hue, bombai se "venkateshwar samachar" ne apana dainik sanskaran prakashit karnaa aarambh kiya or dilli se "vijay" niklaa
 In 1921 "today" from Kashi and "present" from Kanpur were published
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki 1921 main hindi patrakarita phir ek baar karavatein leti he or raajnneetik kshetra main apana nayaa jivan aarambh karti he
 New trends in our literary papers also start from this time
 falat: beesvin shatee ke pehle bees varshon ko ham hindi patrakarita kaa teesraa charan kah sakate hai
 After 1921, the contemporary era of Hindi journalism begins
 is yug main ham rashtriya or saahitiyik chetana ko saath saath pallavit pate hai
 Around the same time, Hindi was entered into universities and some Kriti editors came to know who were fully familiar with the journalism of English and who wanted to bring Hindi papers at par with the letters of English, Marathi and Bengali
 falat: saahitiyik patrakarita main ek nae yug kaa aarambh hua
 National movements declared qualification for the national language of Hindi for the first time and as the strength of national movements started increasing, Hindi journalists and letters started gaining more importance
 1921 ke baad gandhi ji ke netritv main rashtriya andolan madhyavarg tak simit na rahakar graminon or shramikon tak pahunch gaya or uske is prasar main hindi patrakarita ne mahatvapurn yoga diya
 The truth is that Hindi journalists were at the forefront of national movements and took a firm stand against foreign authority
 videshi sarkaar ne anek baar nae nae kanoon banaakar samachaarpatron kii swatantraaa par kutharaghaat kiya parantu jail, jurmaana or anekanek maansik or aarthik kathinaaiyaan jhelte hue bhi hindi patrakaron ne swatantra vichaar kii deepashikha jalaae rakhi
 Among the letters that came to the literary field after 1921 are prominent- vastav main aaj hamaare masik sahitya kii praudhata or vividhta main kisi prakaar kaa andeh nahin ho saktaa
 Many first-class works of Hindi came to light first by menstruation and many excellent poets and litterateurs were also related to journalism
 aaj hamaare masik patr jivan or sahitya ke sabhi angon kii purti karte hai or ab visheshgyata kii ore bhi dhyaan jane laga he
 Like the evolving glimpse of literature trends, it is not found in books
 vahaan hamen sahitya kaa sakriy, sapraan, gatisheel rup praapt hota he
 In the political arena, the newspapers which were popular in this era are - inamen se adhikansh saptahik hai, parantu janaman ke nirmaan main unka yogadan mahatvapurn rahaa he
 As far as letter art is concerned, we can clearly say that there is a difference of earth and sky in the letters of the third and fourth eras
 aaj patrasampadan vastav main ucch koti kii kala he
 In the field of political journalism, "aaj" and its editor late Baburao Vishnu Paradkar occupies almost the same place as Acharya Mahavirprasad Dwivedi in the field of literary journalism
 sach to yah he ki "aaj" ne patrakala ke kshetra main ek mahaan sanstha kaa kaam kiya he or usne hindi ko bisiyon patrasampadak or patrkaar die hai
 Like many parts of modern literature, Hindi journalism is also a new category and in that it is mainly a reflection of the social, cultural, literary and political movements of our middle class
 vastav main pichley 200 varshon kaa sachcha itihaas hamaari patrapatrikaon se hi sankalit ho saktaa he
 In the "kaler Katha" book of Bengali, an attempt has been made to assess the mid-nineteenth-century life of Bengal based on the descent of letters
 hindi main bhi aisa praytn vaanchhneeya he
 In a way, in the nineteenth century, there is very little that can be called literature and whatever it is, it has appeared first in the pages of letters
 bhashastyli ke nirmaan or jaateey style ke vikaas main patron kaa yogadan atyant mahatvapurn rahaa he, parantu beesvin shatee ke pehle do dashakon ke ant tak masik patr or saptahik patr hi hamaari saahitiyik pravritiyon ko janm dete or viksit karte rahe hai
 The experimental form that we see in the literature of Dwivedi era in "saraswati" and "indu" is the true form of that literature
 1921 i
 ke baad sahitya bahut kuch patrapatrikaon se swatantra hokar apane pairon par khadaa hone laga, parantu phir bhi vishisht saahitiyik andolanon ke liye hamen masik patron ke prishth hi ulatney padate hai
 There are magazinelets for political consciousness
 vastut: patrapatrikas jitani badi jansankhya ko chooti hai, vishuddh sahitya kaa utani badi jansankhya tak pahunchnaa asambhav he
 In the 90s, Indian language newspapers, Hindi journalism, Amar Ujala, Dainik Bhaskar, Dainik Jagran etc
 began to come out from the towns and cities
 jahaan pehle mahanagaron se akhbaar chhapate the, bhumandalikaran ke baad aayi nayi takanic, behatar sadak or yatayaat ke sansadhano kii sulabhta kii vajah se chote shaharon, kasbon se bhi nagar sanskaran kaa chapana aasaan ho gaya
 Also, in these decades, the search for new consumers for new goods started in the market spreading in rural areas and towns
 hindi ke akhbaar in vastuon ke prachaar-prasar kaa ek jariya ban kar ubhara he
 At the same time local news is prominently featured in these newspaper editions
 isse akhabaaron ke pathakon kii sankhya main kaaphi badhotaree hui he
 Media expert Sevanti Ninan called it a 'reinvention of the public world of Hindi'
 ve likhti hai, “print media ne sthaneey ghatnaon ke kawarej dwaara jila str par hindi kii maujuud saarvajanik duniya kaa vistaar kiya he or saath hi akhabaaron ke sthaneey sanskarnon ke dwaara anjaane main iskaa punarvishkaar kiya he
 In 1990, the report of the National Reader Survey stated that there was only one Hindi newspaper in the five leading newspapers
 pichley ne sabit kar diya ki ham kitni teji se bad rahe hai
 This time, the first four of the five most read newspapers are in Hindi
 ek utsahjanak baat or bhi he ki iares survey main jin 42 shaharon ko sabase teji se ubharta mana gaya he, unamem se zyaadaatar hindi hriday pradesh ke hai
 It is clear that if the states of the South have increased the tremendous growth of development in the last three decades, then for the next decade we belong to Hindi people
 aisa nahin he ki akhbaar ke adhyayan ke maamle main hi yah pradesh aguva sabit ho rahe hai
 a data from the IT industry shows that the number of people reading and writing on the net in Hindi and Indian languages is increasing continuously
 matlab saaf he
 This expansion of Hindi aspirations is also looking towards journalists
 pragati kii chetana ke saath samaaj kii nichali qatari main baithe log bhi samachar patron kii panktiyon main dikhne chahie
 The results of previous IAS, iits and all education councils have proved that even the people sitting on the lowest steps in Hindi speakers are ready for a big jump
 hindi ke patrakaron ko unase ek kadam aage chalanaa hoga taaki us jagah ko phir se hasil saken, jise pichley chaar dashakon main hamane lagaataar khoyaa

 The body that appears in front of the body after birth, it is the gross body, it is the name of this gross body, by which worldly works are done, this body has to go through worldly sorrows and whatever sorrow
 There is only one language for them that we have some mistake, one who forgets is suffering, there is another body inside this body, which is called subtle body

sooksham sharir)har bhautik sharir ke andar ek sooksham sharir hota he, is baat kaa pataa pehle nahin tha, magar jab se logon ko punarjanm or rishiyon dwaara diye gayi hajaaron saal pehle ke kaaran or aaj ke vaigyanik yug main aakar unka dikhaai dena, jinke bare main pehle kabhi sochaa nahin ho, ve saamne aayen or unako dekh kar ham log yahi kahen, ki yah to bahut pehle dekha tha, yaa suna tha, mangal kii puja ke liye hanumanji kii puja hajaaron saalon se kii ja rahi he or mangal ke liye sabhi ne puraane vedon kii batoo ke anusaar hi unka abhishek aadi karnaa chaalu kar diya tha, magar jab america ke nasa santhaan ne viking mangal par bhej kar mangal kaa cheharaa prakashit kiya, to logon kaa kautuhal or jag gaya ki, vedon main yah baat kis prakaar se pataa lagi thi ki mangal kaa cheharaa ek bandar se miltaa he or mangal ek laal grah he, is baat ke liye kitni baaten jo ham pichley samay se sunate aa rahe hai,"laal deh laali lase or dhari laal langur, bajra deh daanav dalan, jai jai jai copi sur

 When the body is born due to reason, then the body rises like the sun, whatever actions this body has to do in the world, this body has to come to the world towards them, as soon as the work ends it The body moves without any prior notice, gets mixed in water, soil mixes in soil, air mixes in air, fire mixes in fire and the soul takes its journey to be reborn for another work
 Iye is bound, that is called due form body motion

 In the last lines of this letter, Shah Jahan wrote that "ae pisar tu ajab Muslim b pidre zinda ab tarsani afreen baad Hindwan Sad bar main dehnd pidre murdarawa daaym ab"
 iskaa arth he ki putr tu bhi vicitra musalmaan he jo apane jivit pita ko jal ke liye tarasaa rahaa he

 a futures contract is a simple example of this, which is an agreement based on which the underlying asset is exchanged at a future date
 vyutpaadan praayah atyadhik uttolit hote hai, jisase ki antarnihit keemat main ek choti si gatividhi bhi vyutpaadan ke keemat main ek bahut bade antar kaa kaaran ban sakati he
 If the price of the underlying asset changes exactly as the investors predicted, then derivative can be used by investors to estimate the profit and profit from it

 Derivatives are generally broadly classified by: deryvative ek aisa anubandh he jiskaa mul kisi anternihit sampatti se paaya jaataa he
 Many commonly used instruments can be called derivatives because they derive their origin from a property
 udahaaran ke liye equity shares swayan ek deryvative he kyonki ye apana mul equity ke anternihit se nikalate he
 Similarly, one takes insurance for his house so that he can avoid all the risks of the house
 derevatives un sabhi pramuk vittiya sadhano par aadhaarit he jo spasht rup se equity, debt instruments, videshi mudra aadi ke rup main beche jate he
 Thus when we talk about derivatives, we often mean financial derivatives
 derevatives kahi prakaar ke hote he jaise- forwards, futures, vikalp or swaps
 Most derivatives are bought and sold on an exchange in the form of over-the-counter or Bombay Stock Exchange
 derevatives vittiya sadhano or anya do shares or debt ke teen pramukh kshrenio me se ek he
 1
 Derivatives can be tailored in such a way to cater to different needs of users by using either of the upper instruments or, using a combination of two or more devices
 2
 derevatives anternihit parisampattiyon ke bhavishya ke mulya andolanon ke bare me apekshau ke aadhaar par kaarobaar kiya ja saktaa he
 3
 They all have closed balance sheet devices
 4
 ve parisampatti mulyon ke utaar-chadhaav ke jokhim ko kam karne ke liye ek upkaran ke rup me istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The important financial derivatives are as follows: - 1
 forwards 2
 Futures 3
 vikalp 4
 Swaps forwards sabhi derevatives ke sabase purana or pehla he
 a forward contract refers to the exchange of an agreed quantity of an asset for cash at a predetermined date in the future at an agreement between two parties
 vaada kiya parisampatti mudra, vastu, upkarnon, aadi ho saktaa he
 Example: On June 1, x buys 50 bales of cotton at an agreement on Y, on December 1 at a level of Rs
 1000 per bundle from a cotton trader
 yah ek anubandh he jaha X, y ke liye 1 disambar ko 5 xxrep 4 0 rupee kaa bhugtan karata he or y kapaas kii 50 ganthe x ko bechata he
 In a forward contract, a user who promises to buy a specified property at an agreed price in a certain future date is said to be in a 'long position'
 duusari ore, upyogkarta, jo ek bhavishya kii tarik me ek sahmati mulya par bechney ke liye vaada karata he wo ‘choti sthiti’ me hona kaha jaataa he
 Futures contract is where there is an agreement between two parties at an agreed price to exchange any asset or currency or commodity for cash at some future date
 donon anubandh karne ke liye partiyon ko ek duusare se aapasi vishwaas hona chahie
 It only takes place in the organized future market
 futures ke prakaar:- Futures can be divided into two types
 1
 camodity futures 2
 Financial Futures vikalp anubandh kharidaar par yaa bhavishya me ek nirdhaarit tithi se pehle ek purv nirdhaarit mulya par kharid yaa anternihit parisampatti, bajane ke liye ek vikalp detaa he
 The price that is predetermined is called the 'strike price' or 'exercise price'
 vikalp ke prakaar:- The option can be divided into two types
 1
 put vikalp 2
 Double Options put vikalp:- yah aisa vikalp he jo vikalp dharak ko nirdhaarit tithi se pehle purv nirdharik mulya par ek anternihit parisampatti ko bechney kaa adhikaar detaa he
 Double Option: - This is an option in which the option allows the holder to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price before a specified date in the future
 swap ek vyutpann anubandh ke madhyam se do pakshon ke vittiya sadhano kaa aadan-pradaan hota he
 It is an arrangement for the market for that matter to take profit arising from either money market or interest rate market fluctuations or any other market
 bachaav-vyavastha, jokhim ko samaapt karne yaa use kam karne ke liye nirmit ek takanic he
 Through derivatives, risk related to the price of the underlying asset can be transferred from one party to another
 udhaahranswaroop, gehun kii kheti karne vaala ek kisaan or uski pisai karne vaala ek miller, bhavishya main gehun ke ek nirdhaarit pariman ke liye ek nirdhaarit nakad raashi kaa vinimay karne ke liye ek bhavi anubandh par hastakshar kar sakate hai
 Both sides have reduced future risk: the farmer who cultivates wheat has reduced the risk of price uncertainty and Miller has reduced the risk of wheat availability
 haalanki, abhi bhi jokhim he kyonki anubandh main ghatnaon, jaise mausam nirdhaarit nahin he jisase ho saktaa he ki gehun uplabdh na ho yaa yah bhi ho saktaa he ki koi ek paksh anubandh kii sharton se mukar jaae
 yadhyapi is bhavi anubandh kii suraksha ke liye ek tritiy paksh hota he jise clearing house kehete hai, lekin pratipaksh jokhim ke viruddh sabhi vyutpaadan surakshit nahin hote hai
 From the other point of view, both the farmer and the miller mitigate a risk and earn a risk when they sign a future contract: the farmer minimizes the risk that the price of wheat will be lower than the price specified in the contract and that The risk accrues that the price of wheat will be higher than the price specified in the contract
 On the other hand, Miller earns the risk that the price of wheat will be lower than the price specified in the contract and reduces the risk that the price of wheat will be higher than the price specified in the contract
 is arth main, ek paksh jokhim ke ek prakaar ke liye bimakarta he or pratipaksh jokhim ke duusare prakaar ke liye bimakarta he
 Avoidance also occurs when a person or entity buys an asset and sells it using a futures contract
 ek vinirdisht samay ke liye is parisampatti par vyakti yaa sanstha kaa adhikaar hota he or tab vah ise bhavishya main bhavi anubandh ke anusaar ek vinirdisht keemat par bech saktaa he
 Of course, this gives the individual or entity the benefit of the right to the asset, while reducing the risk that the future selling price will unexpectedly deviate from the market's current valuation of the asset's future price
 vyutpaadan, ek vaid vyavsaayik uddeshy prastut karata he
 For example, a corporation borrows a large sum of money at a special interest rate
 rin kaa byaaj-dar prayek chah maheene par phir se nirdhaarit hota he
 The corporation is concerned that the interest rate may be very high in six months
 nigam ek agrasar dar samjhauta kharid saktaa he
 a forward rate agreement is a contract to pay a fixed interest rate for six months after making a purchase at a notional amount of money
 yadi chah maheenon ke baad byaaj-dar, anubandhit dar se adhik ho jaataa he to vikreta, nigam yaa FRA khariddaar ko is antar kaa bhugtan karata he
 If the rate is lower, the corporation will pay this difference to the seller
 FRA kii kharid, dar main vruddhi se sambandhit anischitata ko kam karne kaa kaam karegaa or kamai ko sthir rakhega
 Derivative can be used to acquire risk rather than to insure or prevent risk
 is prakaar, kuch vyakti or sansthaaen, antarnihit parisampatti ke keemat par satta lagane ke liye ek vyutpaadan anubandh kaayam karenge or shart lagaayenge ki antarnihit parisampatti ke bhavi keemat ke bare main beemaa kii maang karne vaala paksh galat sabit hoga
 Speculators would like to be able to buy an asset in the future at a lower price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is higher or to sell an asset in the future at a higher price according to a derivative contract when the future market price is lower
 vyakti or sansthaaen, antarpanan avasaron kii taak main bhi rah sakate hai jab kisi parisampatti kii maujuuda kharid keemat, parisampatti ko bechney ke liye bhavi anubandh main vinirdisht keemat se kam ho
 The speculative trade in derivatives came to great disrepute in the year 1995 when Nick Leeson, a businessman at Barings Bank, made very poor and unauthorized investments in future contracts
 kharaab nirnay, band ke prabandhak ke or niamakon ke paryvekshan kii kami or cobe main aae bukamp jaisi durbhagyapurna ghatnaon ke sangyojan ke madhyam se lisan ko $1

 It is widely said that there are two distinct groups of derivative contracts which differ from each other in the way they are traded in the market: vyutpaadan ke mukhya teen varg hai: More complex derivatives can be formed by combining these basic types of elements
 udhaahranswaroop, swapshan ke dharak ke paas ek vinirdisht bhavi tithi ko yaa usase pehle gamagam main pravesh karne kaa adhikaar, na ki daayitv, hota he
 There are five major classes of underlying assets in the overall derivatives market: in vyutpadanon ke kuch saamaanya udhaaharan is prakaar hai: Other examples of implicit interchangeable are: pakshon ke madhya bhugtan kaa nirdhaaran nimna dwaara kiya ja saktaa he: Some derivatives are rights to buy or sell the underlying security or commodity at a future time for a predetermined price
 yadi antarnihit pratibhuti yaa camodity kii keemat sahi disha main gati karata he to vyutpaadan ke maalik paise kamaate hai, nahin to unke dhan kaa nuksaan hota he yaa vyutpaadan bekaar ho jaataa he
 Depending on the terms of the contract, the potential profit or loss of an derivative may be relatively greater than it would be if the underlying securities or commodity were traded directly
 keemat ke do saamaanya maap hai: For exchange-trade derivatives, the market price is usually transparent
 However, complications may arise with OTC or flur-trade contracts as the trade is handled manually which makes it difficult for prices to spread automatically
 
 khaas taur par OTC anubandhon ke saath, keemton ko milaane or unke prasar ke liye koi vishesh vinimay nahin hota he
 The arbitrage-free price for a derivative contract is complex and has many different variables to consider
 antarpanan-mukt keemat nirdhaaran, vittiya ganit kaa ek mukhya vishay he
 The stochastic process of price of the underlying asset is often important
 saidhantik vikalp keemtankan kaa ek mukhya sameekaran, blike-scoles sutara hai jo is dharna par aadhaarit hota he ki ek europea stock vikalp se hone vaale nakad pravaah ko keval stock kaa prayog karke baar-baar kharidkar or bechakar doharaaya ja saktaa he
 a simplified version of this estimation technique is the binomial choice model
 vyutpadanon ko aksar nimnlikhit aalochanaon kaa saamana karnaa pad saktaa he: The use of derivative can result in very large losses as it involves leverage or borrowing
 vyutpaadan kii sahaayta se niveshkon ko antarnihit parisampatti kii keemat main thodi si bhi halchal se adhik pratifal praapt ho saktaa he
 However, investors could also have lost a very large amount if the price of the underlying asset had a momentum against them
 vyutpaadan bazaaron main baari nuksaanon ke kai udhaaharan hai, jaise: Criticized Financial Market President Clinton's crew members: Larry Summers, Alan Greenspan, Arthur Levitt, and Robert Rubin for destroying attempts to regulate derivatives markets and thus aiding in the collapse of financial markets in Fall 2008

 Bush has stated that regulation was one of the core principles of his political philosophy
 vyutpaadan niveshkon ko pratipaksh jokhim ke liye pradarshit karte hai
 For example, suppose that a person wants to take a loan for his business at a fixed interest rate but when he comes to know that banks only offer loans at variable rates and swap payment facility with the help of another business Provide for which they unrealistically create a fixed rate for the individual
 haalanki, yadi doosraa vyavsaay diwalia ho jaataa he, to yah apane parivartaneey dar kaa bugtan nahin kar saktaa he or isliye pehla vyavsaay apane nishchit dar kii suvidha ko kho degaa or phir se parivartaneey dar par bhugtan karne lagegaa
 If the interest rate is increased, it is likely that the first business may be adversely affected as it may not be ready to pay the higher variable rate
 is tarah se vibhinn prakaar vyutpadanaanon main vibhinn str ke jokhim hote hai
 For example, a standardized stock option by law requires the party to deposit a certain amount of money with the exchange in order to risk that it shows that they can pay in the event of any loss; Banks that help the business swap variable for fixed rates on loans can do a credit check on both sides
 haalanki do companiyon ke bich sthapit nijee samjhauton main, udhaaharan ke liye, rin udhyam or jokhim vishleshan ke pradarshan ke liye maandand nahin bhi ho sakate hai
 Derivatives create unreasonable excessive risk amounts for small or inexperienced investors
 chunki vyutpaadan adhik laabh kii sambhaavna pradaan karte hai, isliye ve vyakti-vishesh niveshkon ke liye bhi ek aakarshan pradaan kar dete hai
 However, derivatives betting, especially for the small investor, often assumes too much risk and requires consistent experience and market knowledge that is part of the reason why some financial planners use these forms Advises against
 vyutpaadan jatil prapatr hai jise beemaa ke prakaar ke rup main nirmit hota he jo pakshon ke madhya unki ichha ke aadhaar par jokhim kaa hastantaran karte hai jisase atirikt jokhim yaa isse bachaav kii kalpana kii ja sake
 Derivatives leverage debt broadly in an economy, making the underlying real economy more nervous in servicing its debt obligations, thus cutting down on real economic activity that could result in recession or even There can also be disappointment
