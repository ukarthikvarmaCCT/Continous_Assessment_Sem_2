 In 2006, it was revealed that The Bourne Survivor tricked viewers into believing that Grylls was stranded alone in the jungle, which was not true, and Channel 4 had to suspend the program for a few weeks
 The issue of manipulation of the scene was raised by Mark Weinert, an American advisor on lifesaving in odd circumstances
 unhone britain ke sande times ko bataaya ki grills ne jab ek registani dweep main fanse hone kaa daawa kiya, tab ve hawaii ke ek motal main raat bitaa rahe the
 Mr
 Weinert also alleged that a raft by team members was added, before it was disassembled, so that it could be filmed by Grylls preparing it

 He was officially made a Chief Scout at the transfer ceremony held at Gilwell 24 on 11 July 2009, where Peter Duncan entrusted the responsibility to a crowd of 3,000 Explorer Scouts
 Grylls is the tenth person to hold the position and the youngest chief scout since Robert Baden Powell was created in 1920

 is nasal kaa yah naam isliye padaa kyoki ise asaliyat main shefrd yani kii charavaahon kii madad karne va bhed bakriyon kii raksha karne ke liye viksit kiya gaya tha
 At that time, the dogs who helped all the shepherds in Germany were called German Shepherd Dogs, later they came to be called Altdeutsche Schaeferhund or Old German Shepherd
 shefrd kutto ko sabase pehle britain main san 1908 main laayaa gaya or euke kennal club ne is nasal ko san 1919 main manyata de di

 jainendra kaa sabase bada yogadan hindi gadhy ke nirmaan main tha
 At the language level, the sabotage done by Zainendra did an unprecedented job of shaping Hindi
 jainendra kaa gadhy na hota to agyeya kaa gadhy sambhav na hota
 The Hindi story learned the first lesson of practicality from Janendra
 jainendra ne hindi ko ek paardarshee bhashaa or bhangima di, ek nayaa tevar diya, ek nayaa `sintex' diya
 Jainndra has an indelible mark on today's Hindi prose
 --rabindra kaaliya janendra ke praayah sabhi upanyaason main darshanik or aadhyatmik tatwon ke samavesh se duruhata ai he parantu ye saare tatv jahaan-jahaan bhi upanyaason main samavisht hue hai, vahaan ve paatro ke antar kaa srijan prathit hote hai
 This is why the characters of Jainndra seem unaffected by the external environment and circumstances and are driven by their introverted motions
 unki pratikriyaayein or vyavhaar bhi praayah inhen gatiyon ke anuroop hote hai
 As a result of this, there is a glut of characters in Jainendra's novels 
 paatro kii alpsankhya ke kaaran bhi janendra ke upanyaason main vaiyaktik tatwon kii pradhanta rahi he
 Elements of revolutionism and militancy are also important bases of Jainendra's novels
 unke sabhi upanyaason main pramukh purush paatr shashakt kranti main aasthaa rakhte hai
 Despite having a kind of tenderness and sense of external nature, interest and behavior, they are great destroyers in their differences
 unka yah vidhwanskaari vyaktitv nari kii premavishyak asweekrutiyon kii pratikriya ke falswaroop nirmit hota he
 For this reason, when they find little shelter, sympathy or love of a woman, then they fall down and then their external nature becomes soft
 janendra ke nari paatr praayah upanyaas main pradhanta liye hue hote hai
 The novelist has introduced subtle psychological vision in the characterization of her female characters
 stri ke vividh roopon, uski kshamtaaon or pratikriyaaon kaa vishwasaneey ankan janendra kar sake hai
 In the novels 'sunita', 'resignation' and 'sukhada', there have been many occasions when her female character has gone through a state of severe mental conflict
 nari or purush kii apurnataa tathaa antarnirbharta kii bhaavana is sangharsh kaa mul aadhaar he
 She understands the man's attraction to him, poses for dedication and is captivated by this ability of complementary emotion, but sometimes when she sees this lack of attraction in the man, she is angry, distressed

 Dwarkanath Shantaram Kotnis was an Indian physician who was sent to China to provide medical aid along with the other four physicians during the 1938 sino-japanese War
 haanazi athwa chini bhavchitra chini bhashaa or japani bhashaa likhane ke liye istemaal hone vaale bhavchitra hote hai
 When they are used for sugar, they are called Hanzhi and when used for Japanese, they are called Kanji
 puraane jamaane main inkaa prayog korian bhashaa or vietnami bhashaa ke liye bhi hota tha
 Chinese image is the oldest ongoing writing method of the world
 vaise to chini main dasiyon hazaar bhavchitra hai, lekin in main se adhiktar keval aitihaasik likhaaiyon main dekhne ko milte hai
 Studies have shown that it is enough to know three to four thousand images to be literate in ordinary Chinese
 har chini bhavchitra ke saath ek uccharan or ek arth judaa hota he or zyaadaatar chini shabd do bhavchitron ke saath likhe jate hai 
 Note that pronunciation varies with the language and language
 yah devanagari lipi ki tarah nahin he ki kisi akshar kaa har jagah vahi uccharan ho
 To understand this, think that if one sees the picture of a mountain, then everyone will understand it, but the Hindi-speaking person will say 'mountain', the Persian-speaking will say 'koh' and the English-speaking will say 'mountain'
 chini bhavchitron ke aksar do yaa teen rup hote hai: Over time, a lot of images had become popular and many of them were complicated to write, so the governments of Japan and China have made some standardizations and simplifications
 is se chini bhashaa ke bahut se shabdon ke do rup hote hai - parmparik chini rup or sarlikrut chini rup
 Japanese and Chinese forms of many words are also similar but slightly different
 chini bhavchitron kii kai shreniyan hoti hai: These were once used to be pictures, but to ease writing and standardize, their appearance has changed a bit
 udhaaharan swaroop, 人 yani 'vyakti', 日 yani 'suraj', 月 yani 'chaand' or 木 yani 'vriksh'
 About 4% of Chinese images belong to this category
 angrezi main is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'pictogram' kehete hai
 This gives them other meanings by slightly tweaking the pictures
 jaise ki jahaan 木 kaa arth 'vriksh', vahaan do vrikshon ko jodakar 林 banataa he, jiskaa matlab ' jhuramut' he
 If three trees are written together, it means 'forest'
 usee tarah 刀 kaa matlab to 'chaaku' he lekin isaki dhar par nishaan lagane se 刃 banataa he, yani ' dhar'
 Words with new meanings have been created by making marks from zara-zara
 angrezi main is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'idiogram' kehete hai
 Words with new meanings are created by adding more than one picture or motif to them
 jaise ki 日 yani 'suraj' or 月 yani 'chaand' ko jodakar 明 yani 'roshan' banataa he
 If a person is attached to a tree, then 休 is formed, which means 'rest'
 isi tarah se 女 or 子 jodne se 好 banataa he, jiskaa arth 'acha' nirdhaarit hua he
 Although some linguists dispute this, another example of this is to combine the 安 sign for 'roof' with the 女 sign for 'woman', which means 'peace'
 aadhunik kaal main bhi aise nae bhavchitra zaroorat ke anusaar gadhe gaye hai
 Platinum is a valuable white metal, for which the image is 鉑, which is made up of 'white' and 'metal'
 usee tarah 'meter' or 'hazaar' ko milakar 粁 bana - yah unnisvi sadi ke ant ke aasapaas prayog hone laga
 In English, the words in this category are called 'idiogramic Compounds'
 kabhi-kabhi aisa hua he ki kisi chiz ke liye chihn nahin tha lekin us shabd kaa uccharan kisi or shabd se miltaa tha jiske liye bhavchitra tha, to vah chihn donon ke liye hi istemaal hone laga
 For example, in many Chinese languages, the word 'zee' also meant 'nose' and 'self'
 'naak' ke liye chihn 自 tha or vah 'swayan' ke liye bhi prayog hone laga
 With the passage of time, the meaning of the 'nose' has been forgotten and in modern Chinese script its meaning is left only to 'itself'
 is shrenee kaa naam 'reebus' angrezi se liya gaya he
 Most of the words in Chinese script belong to this category
 inamen ek yaa ek se adhik chihn aise hote hai jo shabd kaa arth bataate hai or ek bhavchitra aisa hota he jiskaa arth se koi lenaa-dena nahin lekin yah kisi aisi chiz kaa chihn hota he jiskaa uccharan is shabd se miltaa-julata ho
 With this, both the pronunciation and the meaning of the word are known
 udahaaran ke liye 'nadi', 'jhil', 'jharnaa', 'bahut jabardast pani kii dhar, yaa flash kiya gaya pani' or 'phislan' 
 Consider that there are three small ridges on the left side of each sign, which is made by simplifying the picture of 'river'
 is se sanket miltaa he ki shabd 'pani' se sambandhit he
 The right side of the word tells only the sound
 沖 ke dai taraf 中 he, jiskaa arth chini main 'bich' hota he or uccharan 'jhong' hota he
 It can be seen that 沖 is saying 'word related to water, which is pronounced from Zhong', ie 'chong'
 angrezi main aise bhavchitron ke arth bataane vaale hisse ko 'radical' bolte hai or is shrenee ke shabdon ko 'phono-simantic compoundj' kehete hai
 The expressions in this category were first developed during the Shang dynasty and have been found scratched on the bones found in the ruins of that time
 kabhi-kabhi do bhavchitron se ek shabd banataa he jisamen arthbhaag donon bhavchitron par lagu hota he
 For example, there is a Chinese musical instrument, 'beeva' and a fruit is 'lokat'
 in donon ke aakaar dekhne main milte hai
 Biwa was written as 批 把, in which the sign of a hand moving up and down on either side of the two signs is indicated, that is, playing the instrument by moving the hand up and down
 ab isamen 'haath' kaa arthbhaag badalakar 'ped' kaa radical lagane se 枇杷 kaa chihn bana 
 This new two-faced word meant 'fruit of the laukat'
 samay ke saath biva vaadya ke chihn swayan hi badal gaye or aadhunik chini main 琵琶 hai 
 Homogeneous words in languages are those that were once the same but over time their vowels have diverged and sometimes meanings have also changed
 udhaaharan ke liye sanskrit kaa 'pati' shabd or angrezi kaa 'potent' shabd ek hi aadim hind-europea bhashaa ke shabd se utpann hue hai, lekin samay ke saath inke uccharan or arthon donon main zaraa fark aa gaya he
 This has happened in the Chinese language also
 masalan 'kaao' or 'lao' kabhi ek hi shabd hua karte the, lekin samay ke saath inke uccharan or bhavchitra donon ek-dusre se bhinn ho gaye hai
 The expressions in this category are few in Chinese script and in English this category is called 'transformed Cognates'
 comifora mukul Hook
 Guggul or 'guggal' is a tree
 isse praapt raal jaise padaarth ko bhi 'guggal' kaha jaataa he
 Two types of trees of this species are found in India
 ek ko comifora mukul tathaa duusare ko co
 roxbarghai kehete hai
 The species found in Africa is called Comifora africana
 kuch sthanon se praapt guggul kaa rang peelaapan liye shwet tathaa anya kaa gaharaa laal hota he
 There is sweet smell in it
 isko agni main daalane par sthaan sungadh se bhar jaataa he
 Hence it is treated like sunshine
 ayurveda ke matanusaar yah katu tikt tathaa ushn he or kaph, baat, kaas, krimi, kled, shoth or arsh naashak he
 Guggal is a small tree whose leaves are small and alternately simple
 yah sirf varsha ritu main hi vruddhi karata he tathaa isi samay is par pattey dikhaai dete hai
 The rest of the time i
e
 in winter and summer season, its growth gets blocked and becomes leafless
 saamanyat: guggal kaa ped 3-4 meter ooncha hota he
 Its stem produces white colored milk which is a useful part of it
 prakritik rup se guggal bharat ke karnataka, rajasthan, gujarat tathaa madhya pradesh rajyon main ugta he
 In India, Guggal is on the verge of extinction, hence it needs to be cultivated in large areas

 judo dow kaano jigoro dwaara 1882 main japan main banaaya gaya ek aadhunik japani marshall art or ladaaku khel he
 Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, which aims to either knock your opponent to the ground, stagnate or else subdue your opponent with wrestling moves, or by locking a joint ie by jiggling or strangling the joints
 Or to force your opponent to surrender using Dum Ghantu techniques
 haath or pair ke prahaar or waar ke saath-saath hathiyaaron se bachaav karnaa judo kaa ek hissaa he lekin inkaa istemaal keval purv-vyavasthit tareekon main hota he kyonki judo pratiyogita yaa mukt abhyaas main isaki ijaajat nahin di jaati he
 Philosophy and subsequent training developed for judo became models of other modern Japanese martial arts that evolved from traditional schools
 judo ke vishwavyaapee prasar ke falswaroop sambo, bartitsu or brazilian jiu-jitsu jaisi kai upashakhaon kaa vikaas ho gaya he jiskaa vikaas mitsuyo mayeda dwaara 1914 main brazil main judo ke laae jane ke baad hua tha
 Judo practitioners or professionals are called judokas
 judo ke aarambhik itihaas ko iske sansthaapak, japani bahushrut or shikshak jigoro kaano se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Kano was born into a happy Japanese family
 unke dada apni mehnat ke bal main kamyaabi hasil karne vaale, madhya japan ke shiga shasit praant ke ek sharaab nirmaataa the
 However, Kano's father was not the eldest son of his father and therefore did not inherit this business
 iske bajaay, vah ek shinto pujari or sarkari adhikari bane or saath hi saath unke paas tokio imperial uniwarsity kii duusari aagaamee kaksha main apane bete ko daakhil karne kii paryaapt prabhutaa thi
 Kano was very weak in his childhood, his stature was very low and his weight was not more than one hundred pounds even though he was twenty years old and he was often persecuted by the overbearing
 unhone 17 saal kii umr main us samay jujutsu kaa anusaran kiya jis samay yah kala khatm hone lagi thi lekin unhen isamen bahut kam kamyaabi hasil hui
 This was due in part to the difficulty of meeting a teacher who adopted him as a student
 18 saal kii umr main sahitya kii padhai karne ke liye vishvavidhyalay jane ke samay bhi unhone apane marshall art kaa adhyayan jari rakhaa or ant main unhone phukuda hachinosuke ke bare main suna jo tengin shin'yo-riyu ke guru or keico phukuda ke dada the, jo kaano kii ekmaatr jivit chaatra or duniya main sabase ooncha darja paane vaali mahila judoka he
 Fukuda Hachinosuke is said to have emphasized the technique of formal practice by sowing seeds of Kano's Gurucharan on free practice in Judo
 phukuda ke skool main kaano ke shaamil hone ke ek saal se kuch zyada samay bitne ke baad phukuda biimaar pad gaye or unki maut ho gai
 Kano then became a student of another Tenjin shin'yeo-ryu school of Iso Masatomo who emphasized the practice of pre-arranged methods more than Fukuda
 apane samarpan ke bal par kaano ne bahut jald nipun prashikshak kaa kitaab hasil kar liya or 21 saal kii umr main iso ke sahaayak prashikshak ban gaye
 Unfortunately, Iso soon fell ill and Kano adopted a different style, becoming a student of Ikubo Tsunetoshi of Kito-riu, realizing that he still had a lot to learn
 phukuda kii tarah, aikubo ne mukt abhyaas par zyada jor diya
 On the other hand, in kito-ryu, the emphasis was on the techniques of throwing to a much greater extent than in Tenjin shin'yeo-ryu
 is samay tak, kaano nai takneekon ko taiyaar karne main lage the, jaise - "sholder wheel" or "floating hip" daanv
 haalanki, vah pehle se hi kito-riyu or tengin shin'yo-riyu ke siddhanton kaa sirf vistaar karne kii apeksha usase kahin adhik kuch karne par vichaar kar rahe the
 a major reform of jujutsu was planned in Kano's mind full of new ideas whose techniques were based on very good scientific principles and whose main aim was to develop the bravery of martial arts as well as the body, mind and character of the youth
 may 1882 main, 22 saal kii umr main, vishvavidhyalay main apni snaatak kii oopaadhi ke lagbhag khatm hone par, kaano ne aikubo ke skool ke nau chaatro ko kamakura ke eisho-ji naamak ek buddha mandir main jujutsu kaa prashikshan dena shuru kar diya or aikubo prashikshan main madad karne ke liye saptaah main teen din vahaan aate the
 Although two years passed before that temple was called "kodokan" or "place of teaching" and Kano was not given the title of "master" or master of Kito-riu until that time, it was It is now considered to be the founding of Kodokan
 judo ko vastav main kaano jiu-jitsu yaa kaano jiu-do or baad main kodocan jiu-do yaa keval jiu-do yaa judo ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 In the early days it was also commonly referred to as jiu-jitsu until that time
 "judo" shabd kii jad usee chitralipi se nikali he jahaan se "jujutsu" shabd kii nikali he: "jū", jiskaa matlab iske sandarbh ke aadhaar par "namrata", "komalta", "lacheelaapan" or "aasaan" bhi ho saktaa he
 However, such attempts to translate jū are misleading
 inamen se prayek shabd main jū kaa istemaal "soft method" ke marshall arts ke siddhant kaa ek spasht sandarbh he
 The gentle way is characterized by the indirect application of force applied to defeat the opponent
 adhik vishesh rup se, yah vyakti ke pratidwandvi kii takat ko uske khilaaf istemaal karne or badalati paristhitiyon ke anusaar acchhee tarah dhal jane kaa siddhant he
 For example, his opponent may move aside to attack the attacker and use his power to knock him forward
 Kano saw jujutsu as an incompatible bag of tricks that he wanted to unify according to a theory he found to be the solution to the notion of "maximum capacity"
 keval behatar takat par nirbhar karne vaale jujutsu kii takneekon ko pratidwandvi ke bal ko punarnirdeshit karne, pratidwandvi ke santulan ko bigaadane, yaa behatar uttolan kaa istemaal karne vaale ke paksh main sweekaar yaa asweekaar kar diya jaataa tha
 There are differences in the other symptoms of judo and jujutsu
 jahaan jujutsu kaa matlab komalta kii "kala", "vigyaan", yaa "takanic" he, vahiin judo kaa matlab komalta kaa "rasta" he
 The philosophical motive is hidden in the use of "dō", meaning road, road or path
 yah budo or bujutsu ke bich ke antar ke samaan he
 The use of this word has removed the idea of ancient martial arts whose sole purpose was to kill
 kaano ne judo ko shaareerik, maansik, bhaavnaatmak or naitik rup se khud par kaabo karne or khud kaa sudhaar karne ke ek saadhan ke rup main dekha
 unhone dainik jivan main adhiktam kshamta ke bhautik siddhant kaa bhi vistaar kiya or ise "paraspar samruddhi" main viksit kar diya
 In this regard, judo is seen as a holistic approach to extend life well outside the restrictions of the dojo
 judo ke abhyaasakarta ko judoka yaa "judo abhyaasakarta" ke naam se janaa jaataa he, haalanki paaramparik rup se keval chauthe dan yaa usase ooncha darja paane waalon ko "judoka" kaha jaataa tha
 When the -ka suffix is added to an English noun word, it means a person who specializes in that subject or who has special knowledge of that subject
 chauthe dan se neeche kaa darja paane vaale anya abhyaasakartaaon ko kencu-sei yaa "prashikshu" kaha jaataa tha
 In modern times judoka means a judo practitioner with any level of expertise
 judo shikshak ko senseyi kaha jaataa he
 The word sensei is derived from sen or saki and sei which means the person who came before you
 pashchimi dojo main, dan darje ke kisi bhi prashikshak ko senseyi kahana aam baat he
 Traditionally, that title has been reserved for fourth dan or higher instructors
 paaramparik rup se judo abhyaasakarta safed rang kii vardi pahante hai jise judogi kaha jaataa he jiskaa saamaanya matlab judo kaa abhyaas karne ke liye pahana jane vaala "judo poshaak" he
 Sometimes this word is shortened to only used as 'ge'
 judogi kaa nirmaan kaano ne 1907 main kiya tha or baad main isi tarah kii bardiyon ko kai anya marshall art dwaara apana liya gaya
 The modern Judogie is made of a white or blue cotton fabric with a traction lanyard and a matching white or blue cotton fabric quilt-stitched jacket that is fastened with a belt
 darje yaa pad ko suchit karne ke liye belt yaa kamarband ko aam taur par rang diya jaataa he
 The jacket is made with the intention that it can withstand the pressure of wrestling and hence it is made much thicker than a karate uniform
 judogi ko is tarah taiyaar kiya jaataa he ki is par pratidwandvi ko rokkar rakhane main aasaani ho jabaki karaategi ko barsaati kot banane vaali saamagree se banaaya jaataa he taaki pratidwandvi is saamagree par apni pakad na jamaa sake
 The first suggestion of the use of today's blue Judogie was made by Anton Geisink at the 1986 Maastricht IJF DC meeting
 pratiyogita ke liye, do main se ek pratiyogi ek nile rang kaa judogi pahentaa he taaki nyaayakartaaon, nirnayakartaaon or darshakon ko donon main antar karne main aasaani ho
 japan main, donon judoka ek safed rang ke judogi kaa istemaal karte hai or ek pratiyogi ke belt par paaramparik laal saish chipka diya jaataa he 
 japan ke baahar, naaballig pratiyogiyon kii pratiyogitaaon main suvidha ke liye ek rangeen saish kaa istemaal bhi kiya ja saktaa he, nile rang kaa judogi keval kshetreey yaa ucch stareey pratiyogitaaon ke liye jaruri hota he
 Japanese practitioners and purists despise the use of blue colored judogi
 jabaki judo main vibhinn prakaar ke paitaren, jaise - ludhakna, girnaa, phenkna, baith janaa, galaa ghontna, jodon ko ulajhaa dena or hamalaa karnaa, shaamil hai lekin khaas taur par throwing or groundwork par zyada dhyaan diya jaataa he
 The throwing technique is divided into a group of two types of techniques, one of which is - permanent technique and the other is - sacrifice techniques
 In addition permanent technique is divided into hand techniques, hip techniques and foot and leg techniques
 balidaan takanic ko those in which the thrower falls directly backwards or those in which he falls onto his side main vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Ground fighting techniques are divided into attacks against the joints or joint locks, strangleholds or chokeholds and holding or pinning techniques
 judo main ek tarah kii mukkebaaji kaa abhyaas kiya jaataa he jise randori ke naam se janaa jaataa he jiskaa matlab "mukt abhyaas" he
 In Randori, two rivals can attack each other using any of Judo's slapping or grappling techniques
 kata main maarane kii takneekon, jaise - laat maarna or ghunsa maarna or saath hi saath chaaku or talwaar chalaane kii takneekon ko kaayam rakhaa gaya he
 This type of teaching is usually reserved for upper-class practitioners, but is prohibited in competition and is generally prohibited in Randori for safety considerations
 suraksha kii drushti se hi, umr or darje ke aadhaar par galaa ghontna, jodon ko ulajhaa dena or balidaan ke takneekon par pratibandh laga diya jaataa he
 For example, in the United States a person must be 13 or older to use a strangulation technique, and must be 16 or older to use an arm entanglement technique
 randori or khel-pratiyogita ke abhyaas main, jab ek pratidwandvi galaa ghontne yaa jodon ko uljhane kii takanic kaa istemaal karne main kaamyaab ho jaataa he to doosraa pratidwandvi haar maan letaa he yaa use "maat" milti he or is tarah pratidwandvi ko do baar maat de dene se is baat kaa saafe sanket miltaa he ki vah pratidwandvi haar chukaa he
 When this happens, the match is over, and the outlawed player loses and is freed by a strangulation or joint manipulation technique
 kata ke rup hamalaa or bachaav kii purv vyavasthit paddatiyaan hai jiskaa abhyaas judo main judo kii takneekon main maharath hasil karne ke uddeshy se kisi saathi ke saath kiya jaataa he
 More specifically, their objectives include - explaining the basic principles of judo, demonstrating the correct use of the technique, teaching the philosophical principles on which judo is based, allowing the practice of the techniques to be used in competition Is not allowed and preserve those ancient techniques which are historically important but which are now contemporary Neither is not used in judo
 tarah-tarah ke kata kaa gyaan oonja darja paane ke liye jaruri he
 The seven spun recognized by Kodokan in today's times are as follows: kuch aise bhi kata hai jinhen kodocan dwaara aadhikarik rup se manyata nahin di gai he lekin unka abhyaas jari he
 The most prominent example of this is a spun called 'go no Sen no Kata', in which attention is paid to counter attack on the attempted attack
 judo main ek mukt shaileewale mukkebaaji ke abhyaas par jor diya jaataa he jise randori kaha jaataa he jo iske prashikshan ke mukhya roopon main se ek he
 Part of the time of the fight takes place in making the practice of boxing permanent which is called tachi-vaja and the rest of it is on the ground called ne-vaja
 mukkebaaji kaa abhyaas bhi suraksha ke niyamon ke anusaar hi kiya jaataa he jo apane aap keval takneekon kaa abhyaas karne se kahin adhik jeevant hota he jise pehle jujutsuka kiya karte the
 The use of full strength develops the muscles and cardiovascular system physically, and mentally develops strategy and reaction time, and helps the practitioner to learn how to use techniques against an opposing opponent
 judoka ke bich ek aam kahawat he, "judo kaa sabase acha prashikshan judo he
 " mukkebaaji ke abhyaas ke kai prakaar hai, jaise - ju renshu ; or kakaari geico In judo, there are two main stages of fighting: standing or standing phase, tachi-waza; And the ground phase, ne-vaja; Each stage requires its own techniques, strategies, randori, conditioning or adaptation, etc
 khai ko paatane ke liye "sankramanakalin" takneekon kaa vishesh prashikshan bhi diya jaataa he
 Judoka can be quite efficient in one phase and slightly weaker in the second stage depending on what interests them most, although most are balanced between the two
 judo main mukaable ke sthaayee or jamini donon charnon ke shaamil hone kii vajah se judoka ko apane sthaayee yaa khadey pratidwandvi ko neeche khinchne or uske baad use jameen par takalif dekar samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii kshamta milti he
 In the standing or standing phase, which takes precedence according to the rules of the competition, the contestants try to bang each other or use the technique of forcing the joints to stand up and strangle / choke / surrender while the rules According to this, it is much less in the standing or standing phase because it is more difficult to use these techniques while standing than in the banging
 Is taken
 haalanki kuch judoka apane pratidwandvi ko neeche giraane ke saath-saath samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii donon takneekon kaa ekasaath istemaal karne main kaaphi kushal hote hai jahaan samarpan karne par majaboor karne kii takanic kii shuruyaat khadey hone kii sthiti main hoti he or jameen par khatm hoti he
 However, it is prohibited to use the technique of manipulating joints
 neeche giraane kii takanic kaa mukhya uddeshy apane pairon par khadey, gatisheel avasthaa main khadey yaa khatarnaak sthiti main khadey pratidwandvi ko uske peeth ke bal jameen par patake dena he jahaan vah utana prabhavi bhang se harakat nahin kar saktaa he
 Thus, the main reason for dropping or being knocked down is to control the opponent and put himself in an effective position
 is tarah se abhyaasakarta ke paas ek nirnaayak parinaam prastut karne kii adhik kshamta hoti he
 Another reason for knocking down the opponent is to force his body into the ground by forcibly slapping him
