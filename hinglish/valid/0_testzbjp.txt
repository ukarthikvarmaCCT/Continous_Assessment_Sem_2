 a solar eclipse is a kind of eclipse when the moon passes between the earth and the sun and when viewed from the earth, the sun is completely or partially covered by the moon
 bhautik vigyaan kii drushti se jab surya va prithvi ke bich main chandramaa aa jaataa he to chandramaa ke peeche surya kaa bimb kuch samay ke liye dhak jaataa he, usee ghatana ko surya grahan kaha jaataa he
 The earth revolves around the sun and the moon revolves around the earth
 kabhi-kabhi chaand, suraj or dharti ke bich aa jaataa he
 Then he stops some or all of the sunlight, which spreads the shadow over the earth
 is ghatana ko surya grahan kaha jaataa he
 This event always happens on the new moon day
 aksar chaand, suraj ke sirf kuch hisse ko hi dhaktaa he
 This situation is called khand-eclipse
 kabhi-kabhi hi aisa hota he ki chaand suraj ko puri tarah dhank letaa he
 This is called complete eclipse
 purna-grahan dharti ke bahut kam kshetra main hi dekha ja saktaa he
 At a maximum contact of 250 kilometers
 is kshetra ke baahar keval khand-grahan dikhaai detaa he
 At the time of complete eclipse, it takes two hours for the moon to pass through the sun
 chaand suraj ko puri tarah se, zyaada se zyaada, saat minute tak dhankta he
 The sky darkens for a few moments, or rather it turns night into day
 grahan prakruti kaa ek adbhut chamatkaar he
 If seen from astrology point of view, unprecedented unique, bizarre astrology makes knowledge of planets and satellites and their nature clear
 surya grahan tab hota he, jab surya aanshik athwa purna rup se chandramaa dwaara aavruth ho jaae
 For this type of eclipse, the moon must travel between the Earth and the Sun
 isse prithvi par rahane vaale logon ko surya kaa aavruth bhaag nahin dikhaai detaa he
 The lines joining the North Pole with the South Pole are called longitudes and the lines going around the equator are known as Anaksha
 surya grahan sadaiv amavasya ko hi hota he
 When the moon is at its lowest and the sun is full and bright
 chandra or raahu yaa ketu ke rekhaansh bahut nikat hone chahie
 The lunar latitude should be almost zero and this will happen when the lunar is on the Ravimarga or near the Ravimarga, the angular diameters of the Sun and the Moon are the same on the day of solar eclipse
 is kaaran chand surya ko keval kuch minute tak hi apni chaaya main le paata he
 The area which is covered at the time of solar eclipse is called full shadow region
 chandramaa dwaara surya ke bimb ke puure yaa kam bhaag ke dhake jane kii vajah se surya grahan teen prakaar ke hote hai jinhen purna surya grahan, aanshik surya grahan va valayakaar surya grahan kehete hai
 a full solar eclipse occurs when the moon, lying close to the Earth, moves between the Earth and the Sun and the Moon completely takes the Earth into its shadow zone
 iske falswaroop surya kaa prakaash prithvi tak pahunch nahin paata he or prithvi par andhkaar jaisi sthiti utpann ho jaati he tab prithvi par puraa surya dikhaai nahin detaa
 The eclipse created in this way is called a complete solar eclipse
 aanshik suryagrahan main jab chandramaa surya va prithvi ke bich main is prakaar aae ki surya kaa kuch hi bhaag prithvi se dikhaai nahin detaa he arthath chandama, surya ke keval kuch bhaag ko hi apni chaaya main le paata he
 Due to this, some part of the sun is unaffected by eclipse in the grass and some part is eclipse, so the eclipse in that particular part of the earth is called partial solar eclipse
 valayakaar surya grahan main jab chandramaa prithvi ke kaafii dur rahete hue prithvi or surya ke bich main aa jaataa he arthath chandra surya ko is prakaar se dhaktaa he, ki surya kaa keval madhya bhaag hi chaaya kshetra main aata he or prithvi se dekhne par chandramaa dwaara surya puri tarah dhakaa dikhaai nahin detaa balki surya ke baahar kaa kshetra prakashit hone ke kaaran kangan yaa valay ke rup main chamakta dikhaai detaa he
 The solar eclipse made in bracelet shape is called annular solar eclipse
 khagol shastriyon nen ganit se nishchit kiya he ki 18 varsh 18 din kii samyavadhi main 41 surya grahan or 29 chandragrahan hote hai
 There can be up to 5 solar eclipses and 2 lunar eclipses in a year
 kintu ek varsh main 2 suryagrahan to hone hi chahie
 Yes, if there are 2 eclipses in any year, both of them will be eclipsed
 yadhyapi varmbhar main 7 grahan tak sambhavya hai, tathaapi 4 se adhik grahan bahut kam hi dekhne ko milte hai
 Each eclipse occurs again after 18 years and 11 days have passed
 kintu vah apane pehle ke sthaan main hi ho yah nishchit nahin hai, kyonki sampaat bindu nirantar chal rahe hai
 Generally, lunar eclipses are seen more than solar eclipses, but the truth is that there are more solar eclipses than lunar eclipses
 3 chandragrahan par 4 suryagrahan kaa anupaat aata he
 The reason for more sighting of the lunar eclipses is that they are seen in more than half of the earth, while the solar eclipse often appears in a large part of the earth less than a hundred miles wide and two to three thousand miles long
 
 udhaaharan ke taur par yadi madhyapradesh main khagrass grahan ho to gujarat main khand suryagrahan hi dikhalaai degaa or uttar bharat main wo dikhaayi hi nahin degaa
 Whether the eclipse has any spiritual significance or not, but for scientists all over the world, this opportunity is not less than a celebration
 kyon ki grahan hi vah samay hota he jab brahmand main anekon vilakshan evam adbhut ghatnaayen ghatit hotin hai jisase ki vaigyanikon ko naye naye tathyon par kaary karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 In 1968, a scientist named Larkier discovered the presence of helium gas in the chromosphere on the basis of a solar eclipse discovery
 ainstin kaa yah pratipaadan bhi surya grahan ke avasar par hi sahi siddh ho sakaa, jisamen unhone anya pindon ke gurutvkarshan se prakaash ke padane kii baat kahi thi
 The lunar eclipse can be seen in its entire area of light, but the solar eclipse can be seen only in a maximum area of 10 thousand kilometers and 250 kilometers wide
 sampoorn suryagrahan kii vaastavik avadhi adhik se adhik 11 minute hi ho sakati he usase adhik nahin
 The composition of all the material of the world is possible only through the sun signs
 yadi sahi prakaar se surya or uski rashmiyon ke prabhaavon ko samaj liya jaae to samast dharaa par ascharyajanak parinaam laae ja sakate hai
 Each Rashmi of the Sun represents a particular molecule, and as evident, each substance is formed from a particular atom
 ab yadi surya kii rashmiyon ko puunjibhoot kar ek hi vishesh bindu par kendrit kar liya jaae to padaarth parivartan kii kriya bhi sambhav ho sakati he
 Even before the Vedic period, the need to create a calendar based on astronomical structure was felt

 Microorganisms collect in food items, water etc
 and contaminate it
 isliye rishiyon ne paatro ke kush daalane ko kaha he, taaki sab keetanu kush main ekatrit ho jaaen or unhen grahan ke baad phenkaa ja sake
 They are made holy by putting fire in the characters so that germs die
 grahan ke baad snaan karne kaa vidhaan isliye banaaya gaya taaki snaan ke dauraan sharir ke andar ooshmaa kaa pravaah bade, bheetar-baahar ke keetanu nasht ho jaaen or dhul kar bah jaaen

 Old water, food grains are destroyed and new food is cooked and freshly filled and drunk
 grahan ke baad dom ko daan dene kaa adhik mahatmaya bataaya gaya he, kyonki dom ko rahu-ketu kaa swaroop mana gaya he
 In the solar eclipse, four hours before the eclipse and three hours before the lunar eclipse should not be eaten

 saraswatikanthabharan, kavyatatv kaa vivechan karanevaala sanskrit-sahitya-shaastra kaa ek mananeey granth he jisaki rachana dhareshwar ke maharaj bhojraj ne kii
 The time of Maharaja Bhojraj has been accepted by historians from 1010-1055 AD
 atev saraswatikanthabharan kaa rachanakaal isvi gyarahavin shatabdi kaa madhya mana ja saktaa he
 Its pioneer is somewhat predecessor to Mammatt, the author of Kaviprakash
 yadhyapi aanandavardhan dwaara dhvanisiddhant kii sthapana ho chuki thi tathaapi us samay tak kaavyatma ke rup main dhwani kii manyata vivadagrast si hi thi ; atev saakshaat rup se dhwani ko kavy kii paribhaasha main aatma ke rup main sthaan dene kii dridhtaa na bhojdev ne hi apanaai or na bhatta mammat ne hi
 Both acharyas have given importance to doshava and quality in poetry
 bhojdev kii yah visheshta he ki unhone alankaaron kii upadayeta kanthat: sweekaar kii he tathaa kavy ke liye rasanvit hona aavashyak samajha he
 Thus, Bhojdev's Saraswati Kantha Bharan has influenced Mammat and Vishwanath in part
 saraswatikanthabharan ek dirghakaay granth he jisamen paanch pariched hai
 In the first passage, after giving the definition of poetry general, the author has first discussed the long and virtue of poetry
 isi sandarbh main bhojdev ne pad, vaakya evam vaakyarthgat dosha bataae hai
 The number of defects of each type is sixteen
 bhojdev ke anusaar gun, shabdagat or vaakyarth gat hote hai or prayek ke choubees bhed hai
 At the end of the first passage, certain defects become attributes somewhere
 is kavyatatv ko udhaaharan dwaara samajhaate hue unhone kavyadosha kaa nityanityatv sweekrut kiya he
 In the second passage, while deciding on the phraseology, he first emphasized justification and has given a thoughtful explanation of caste, ritual, attitude, shadow, posture, utterance, tact, bhuniti, hump, bed and readiness
 in baarah tatwon main se reeti ko chhod shesh tatwon kaa vishad vivechan sanskrit ke kisi anya uplabdh sahityagranth main praapt nahin hota
 Banabhatta mentions the bed of special poetic element, but its definition is available only in Saraswati Kantabharana
 tatpashchaat, yamak, shlesh, anupras, chitra, prahelika, gudh evam prashnottar alankaaron ke bhuri bhedopabhedon kaa sodaaharan vivaran diya gaya he
 This part also has the most personal feature of Saraswati Kantabharan
 tadnantar bhojdev kavyavyutpatti ke kaarnon kaa vivechan kar kavy ke teen bhedon ko shravy, drishy evam chitrabhinay ke rup main prastut karte hai
 He has not mentioned Darsuparchakas under visualization, but his division on dance and dance is limited
 tisare pariched main arthanlakaaron ke swaroop evam prakaar bhed kaa vivechan he jo itar saahityachaaryon kii apeksha bhinn swaroop ko liye hue he
 In the fourth passage, there is a discussion of bisexuality, in which the distinction of ornaments of upma etc
 is explained in detail
 antim pariched he - rasvivechan
 In it, the character of Naikadi and the expressions, emotions and experiences have been decided in detail; At the same time, there is also a reference to the form of Kavyapaka, the diverse nightlife
 ant main bharti, kaishiki aadi vrittiyon ke vivechan ke saath granthopasanhaar hota he
 Rasasiddhanta's explanation in Saraswati Kantabharana is often a bird's eye view of the subject
 kavyagat ras gambhir vishay he jisaki garima ke saath purnat: nyaay karne kii drushti se bhoj ne ek shringarprakash naamak swatantra granth kii rachana kar rasvivechan ke adhyay kii purti kii he
 The specialty of Saraswati Kantha Bharan is that it is a broader and derivative text than other literary texts
 iske rachayita bhojdev granthvistaar ke bhay se bhit honevaale nahin hai, udhaaharan de-dekar anek sookshm bhed evam upabhedon ko samajhane kaa sadaa ve udaar prayaas karte hai
 Although the recognition of the discrimination presented by them has not been accepted by the later writers, yet the persistence of disagreeing with their elemental deliberations is also not visible
 is granth par adyopant kisi tikaa kii rachana nahin milti
 On the first three passages, there is a vaccine called Ratneshwar Ramsinghrit Darpan Tika and on the fourth passage, the description of the famous commentator Jagadghar, is not the vaccine for the fifth passage
 yah granth nirnay sagar dwaara prakashit he
 It has not been translated yet

 The term chemotherapy is made up of two words - chemical means chemotherapy and therapy
 ksi ko kis prakaar kii chemotherapy di jaae, iskaa nirnay is baat par nirbhar karegaa ki aapako kis prakaar kaa cancer he
 Chemotherapy may also be given alone or with surgery or radiotherapy
 chemotherapy anek tareekon se di ja sakati he, ise dene kii sabase aam vidhiyaan hai- Depending on your treatment, it can be given at various intervals, such as daily, weekly, every two / three weeks or continuously
 chemotherapy ke phaayde is baat par nirbhar karte hai ki aapako kis prakaar kaa cancer he or vah kitna bad chukaa he
 The objectives of chemotherapy include the following: chemotherapy upachaar ke anek sambhavit dushprinaam hai
 These side effects will depend on the type of chemotherapy suggested to you
 mukhyatah rakt koshikaayen teen prakaar kii hoti hai, jo is prakaar hai- Your blood cell count may decrease with chemotherapy treatment
 isliye aapke rakt kii jaanch niyamit taur par kii jaaegi
 The number of white cells, red cells and platelets will be seen in these investigations
 yadi chemotherapy upachaar dwaara aapaki safed koshikaayen ghat gai hai, to aapkesharir main sankraman se ladne kii kshamta kam ho jaaegi
 One way to know if you have an infection is to increase your body temperature
 yadi aapke sharir kaa taapmaana 37
5 degree celsius yaa usase adhik he, athwa aapako gale main ghaav hone, khaansee, zukam yaa dast jaise sankraman ke koi bhi lakshan najar aate hai, to aapako turant doctor se sampark karnaa chahie
 If you have very few white blood cells, your treatment may need to be postponed for some time
 ye koshikaayen sharir ke sabhi angon tak oxigen pahunchaati hai
 If these are reduced, you may experience fatigue and yellowing, which is known as blood deficiency
 yadi aapaki laal koshikaayen saamaanya str se neeche hai, to aapako khun chadhvane kii jarurat pad sakati he
 These cells bind the blood flow, for example, when one of your organs is cut a little, then these cells bind the blood flow

 If you need any kind of advice about eating and drinking during your chemotherapy treatment, you can ask your doctor or nurse to refer you to a dietician
 aapkaa swaad badal saktaa he, par praayah upachaar puraa hone ke do se teen maheenon ke bheetar vah phir se saamaanya ho jaataa he
 Chemotherapy treatment can sometimes cause nausea and / or vomiting
 kuch chemotherapy upachaaron dwaara anya kii tulana main michali aane kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he
 However, vomiting is an uncommon thing nowadays because you will be given medicines to relieve nausea which are often very effective

 It is possible that some part of the chemotherapy is in the fluid coming out of your body, so in this case the use of condoms will protect your partner
 yah jaruri he ki apane upachaar ke dauraan athwa upachaar ke baad kam se kam chah maheene tak aap garbhadhaaran na karen yaa yadi aap purush hai to apane saathi ko garbhvatee hone den

 You should wear rubber gloves if the body fluids have spread or your hands are stuck on them

 His creations portray the anxious isolation of modern society
 samakaleen aalochakon or shikshavidon, vladimir nabokove sahit, kaa maananaa he ki kafka 20 veen sadi ke sarvshereshth lekhakon main se ek he
 "kafkaesque" has become part of the English language which is used to refer to 'seductive', 'dangerous complexity', etc
 nai yorker ke liye ek lekh main, jon apadike ne samajhaayaa: "jab kafka kaa janm hua tab us sadi me aadhuniktaa ke vichaaron kaa panapana armbh hua - jaise ki sadiyon ke bich main ek nai aatm-chetana, naepan kii chetana kaa janm hua ho
 Even after so many years after his death, Kafka embodies one aspect of modern ideology - that feeling of worry and shame that cannot be located therefore cannot be pacified; Within every step of the feeling of an infinite difficulty, which hinders every step; Like the body that suffers from every touch when its old skin is stripped of its sensitivity beyond utility, such as social use and religious belief
 kafka ke is ajeeb or ucch mul maamle ko dekhen to unka yah bhayanak gun vishaal komalta, vicitra va acha hasya, kuch gambhir or aashwast aupchaarikta se bharpoor tha
 This combination makes him an artist, but he has struggled against greater inner resistance and more serious skepticism as to the value of his art

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga Aranyaka is the prose section of the Vedas, the holiest and highest book of Hinduism
 ye vaidic vaanmay kaa teesraa hissaa he or vaidic samhitaon par diye bhashya kaa doosraa str he
 It has written about philosophy and knowledge, it is silent about rituals
 inaki bhashaa vaidic sanskrit he
 There is a combined designation of Vedas, Mantras and Brahmins
 mantrabrahmanyorvednamadheyam 
 The Aranyak is the least of the three parts of Brahman
 sayan ke anusaar is namakaran kaa kaaran yah he ki in granthon kaa adhyayan arany main kiya jaataa tha
 The main theme of Aranyaka is the spiritual epistemology of rituals, rather than rituals of sacrificial fires
 vastut: yajna kaa anushthan ek nitant rahasypurna pratikatmak vyapaar he or is pratik kaa puraa vivaran aaranyak grantho main diya gaya he
 The glory of pranavidya is also featured in these texts
 samhita ke mantron main is vidya kaa beej avashya uplabdh hota he, parantu aaranyakon main isi ko pallavit kiya gaya he
 The fact is that the Upanishads elaborately explain the facts indicated in the Aranyaka
 is prakaar samhita se upanishdon ke bich kii shrinkhalaa is sahitya dwaara purna kii jaati he
 The spiritual importance of the Aranyaka texts is more than that of the Brahmin texts
 ye apane naam ke anusaar hi arany yaa van se sambaddh hai
 What is read or taught in Aranya is called 'aranyak' - Aranya Bhavam Aranyakam
 aaranyak granthon kaa pranayan praayah brahmanon ke pashchaat hua he kyonki isamen durbodh yajna-prakriyaaon ko sookshm aadhyatm se joda gaya he
 These texts have been composed primarily for the knowledge of self-realization and theology for the Vanaprasthis and ascetics - it is believed
 aaranyak granth vastutah brahmanon ke parishisht bhaag hai or upanishdon ke purvarup
 In the Upanishads, the beginning of the serious philosophical themes about theatricalism, creation and philosophy is visible in the Aranyakas
 aaranyakon main vaidic yaagon ke aadhyatmik or darshanik pakshon kaa vivechan he
 There is a special description of life in these
 kalchakra kaa vishad varnan taittiriya aaranyak main praapt hota he
 The description of Yajnopaveet is also found first in this Aranyaka
 vaidic tatvamimasaa ke itihaas main aaranyakon kaa vishesh mahatva sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 In this, the deep mysteries of Yajna have been inaugurated
 inamen mukhya rup se aatmavidya or rahasyatmak vishyon ke vivaran hai
 It seems that these texts have been practiced for the vanaprastha-ashram dwellers who are engaged in self-study and religious work in the forest
 aaranyak granthon main pranavidya kii mahima kaa vishesh pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 Apart from pranavidya, Aryanakas have special significance in describing the symbolism, theosophy, spirituality
 anek aitihaasik or saanskrithik tathyon kii prastuti ke kaaran bhi aaranyak granth upoday hai
 In fact, these texts are like a link connecting Brahmin texts and Upanishads, as they help in studying the development of the Upanishads' prophetic subject and language style
 aaranyakon ke mukhya granth nimnlikhit he : It is related to Rigveda
 aitarey ke bheetar paanch mukhya adhyay hai jinamein pratham teen ke rachayita aitarey, chaturth ke aashvalyan tathaa pancham ke shaunak maane jate hai
 Dr
 Keith considers it to be ancient rather than Nirukta, and its creation is considered to be pre-century century old, but in fact it is older than Nirukta
 aitarey ke pratham teen aaranyakon ke karta mahidas hai isse unhen aitarey brahman kaa samakaleen maananaa nyaayay he
 It is also related to the Rigveda
 yah aitarey aaranyak ke samaan he tathaa pandrah adhyyon main vibhakt he jiskaa ek ansh kaushitaki upanishad ke naam se prasiddh he
 Divided into ten passages, called "aran"
 inamen saptam, ashtum tathaa navam prapathak milakar "taittiriya upanishad" kehalaate hai
 In fact, Shukla is one of the Aranyakas of the Yujurveda, but due to the abundance of spiritual facts it is counted in the Upanishads
 samaveda se sambhddha ek hi aaranyak he
 Which has four chapters and many chapters in each chapter
 chaturth adhyay ke dasham anuwak main prakhyat tavalkaar upanishad he
 Every Veda has one or more Aranyakas
 atharvaveda kaa koi aaranyak uplabdh nahin he
 According to the Aranyakas, according to the Vedas, yadhyapi atharvaveda kaa pruthak se koi aaranyak praapt nahin hota he, tathaapi uske gopath brahman main aaranyakon ke anuroop bahut si saamagree milti he

 ipos can be a risky investment
 For individual investors, it is difficult to predict how the shares will perform in their early day trading and in the near future as they do not have enough data to analyze the company as well as most ipos
 Those companies are going through a temporary development, so there is uncertainty in terms of their future value

 In a multinational IPO, the issuer's company may have up to three organizations of underwriters to deal with different legal requirements to suit other markets
 For example, an EU issuing company is represented in its domestic market, Europe, The principal underwriting organization may
 anya bazaaron jaise america / canada or asia ke liye alag hamidaar sanghathan ho sakate hai aamtaur par, pramukh bazaar kaa pramukh hamidaar bank anya bazaaron main bhi company kaa pramukh hamidaar hota he

 Most ipos can be found on the Nasdaq stock market, which lists computer and information technology related companies
 But, relatively new and untested firms are large
 Despite the availability of large amount of financial resources, a large number of firms started falling into cash crisis
 The crisis was particularly in cases where the founding party had sold an important portion of its stake immediately after the atav issue of the IPO
 yah ghatana thi sanyukt rajya tak simit nahin thi
 In Japan, for example, a similar situation was presented

 Perhaps the most obvious bubbles in the history of the hot IPO market were in 1929 and 1989, when ipos of limited-term funds were sold at extremely large premiums
 If we compare the market value of limited-term funds to the value of the shares included in the fund
 Bubbles are seen when the market price is in multiples of the underlying value

 People's perception about the IPO may be controversial
 The IPO was a complete failure for the people who got it as much capital as possible
 It was important to note that there are different types of investors in an auction and in the open market - the auction was believed to be a complete success for those who were measuring the IPO by the benefits of devaluation to investors
 Institutions bid in and individual investors in the open market Google may be a special case but because many individual investors have recently issued ipo's for stock Mbi term buy to keep in mind ke value, aitihaasik taur par dekhen to america or vaishvik donon hi staron par ipo avamoolyit rahe hai ipo kaa praarambhik avamulyan, stock ke pehali baar kaarobaar main aate samay usame atirikt ruchi paidaa karne kaa kaam karata he yah un niveshkon ke liye ullekhneey laabh kaa strot ho saktaa he jinhen 'maangi keemat' par share mili hon haalanki, ipo kaa avamulyan karne par company ko us poonji ko tyaagna hota he jise vah stock ko unche mulya par vikray kar praapt kar sakati thi The risk of overvaluation is also an important consideration

 Ekadashi fasting holds an important place in Hinduism
 prayek varsh choubees ekadashiyaan hoti hai
 When Adhikamas or Malamas comes, then their number increases to 26
 jyeshtha maas kii shukla paksh kii ekadshi ko nirjala ekadshi kehete he is vrath me pani kaa pinaa varjit he isiliye is nirjala ekadshi kehete he
 When the omniscient Ved Vyas pledged the Ekadashi fasting to the Pandavas to give the four Purusharths - Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha, Mahabali Bhima requested - Father! You have spoken of fasting for one day per side
 main to ek din kya ek samay bhi bhojan ke bagaiyr nahin rah saktaa- mere pet main 'vruk' naam kii jo agni he, use shant rakhane ke liye mujhe kai logon ke baraabar or kai baar bhojan karnaa padataa he
 So, will i be deprived of virtuous things like Ekadashi due to my hunger? pitamah ne bhim kii samasya kaa nidaan karte or unka manobal badhaate hue kaha- nahin kuntinandan, dharm kii yahi to visheshta he ki vah sabko dhaaran hi nahin karata, sabake yogya saadhan vrath-niyamon kii badi sahaj or lacheelee vyavastha bhi uplabdh karwaata he
 Therefore, you fast for only one Ekadashi named Nirjala of Shukla Paksha of Jyeshtha month and you will get the fruits of all the Ekadashis of the year
 nihsandeh tum is lok main sukh, yash or praptavya praapt kar moksh laabh praapt karoge
 On such assurance, Vrikodar Bhimsen too agreed to fast this Ekadashi
 isliye varsh bhar kii ekadashiyon kaa punya laabh dene vaali is shreshth nirjala ekadshi ko lok main pandav ekadshi yaa bhimseni ekadshi bhi kaha jaataa he
 On this day one who keeps himself waterless and donates a pot full of pure water to a Brahmin or a needy person with this mantra
 ek baar maharishi vyas pandavo ke yahan padhaare
 Bhima said to Maharishi Vyas, God! Yudhishthra, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva, Mata Kunti and Draupadi all fast on Ekadashi and ask me to keep the fast, but i cannot live without eating, so tell me any such fast by avoiding the pain of being restless on twenty-four Ekadashis
 Which i do not have any special inconvenience to do and i also get the fruits of everything
 maharishi vyas jaanate the ki bhim ke udar main brik naamak agni he isliye adhik maatra main bhojan karne par bha uski bhukh shant nahi hoti he maharishi ne bhim se kaha tum jyeshtha shukla ekadshi kaa vrath rakhaa karo
 In this fast, drinking water in bathing achman is not to blame, this fast will also benefit the virtue of other twenty-three Ekadashis
 Follow this fast for life
 When he became insensible, the Pandavas made Gajajal, Tulsi Charanamrit Prasad, make him smile
 isliye ise bhimsen ekadshi bhi kehete hai
 Both men and women should do this fast
 is din nirjal vrath karte hue sheshshayi rup me bhagwaan vishnu kii aradhana kaa vishesh mahatv he
 On this day, chanting भग Namo Bhagwate Vasudevaya, donating cow dung, clothes, umbrella, fruits etc
 should be done

 It begins with the fury of Eklige, the hero of poetry in the Greek camp
 agamemnan ne suryadev apollo ke pujari kii putree ko balaatkaarpurvak apane paas rakh choda he
 As a result, epidemics spread in the Greek camp
 bhavishyadrashtaa kalks ne batalaaya ki jab tak pujari kii putree ko nahin lautaaya jayega tab tak mahamari nahin rukegi
 Agamemnon presents for this with great difficulty, but in return he snatches a second daughter, Briseis, from the Achilles

 Patroclus defeats Eilean's army, but in the end he is killed by the Healer of Eilean
 patroklas ke nidhan kaa samachar sunakar ekilies shok or krodh se pagal ho jaataa he or agamemnan se sandhi karke naveen kavach dhaaran kar hektar se apane mitra kaa badla lene yuddh kshetra main pravisht ho jaataa he

 In the middle of the creation of the ninth book, he attained the achievement of his life

 The truth of this era was proved to be indisputable after Schleiman and Default excavated the city of Tri

 stri paatro main hellen, hecuba, andromaco ityadi mahaan hai
 In the war, humans and gods all participate, somewhere humans rise higher than the gods in qualities, and somewhere the gods become visible victims of human weaknesses and become characters of ridicule
 bhartiya mahakavyon ke saath eliyad kii anek baaten mail khaati hai, jinamein hellen kaa apharan or ilian kaa dahan sita-haran or lankadahan se spasht saadrishy rakhte hai

 In view of the difficulty faced in preparing the program by machine language and assembly language, computer scientists got involved in the research that now such programming language should be prepared which is not dependent on computer machine
 computer programing bhashaa ke vikaas kaa yah aglaa kadam tha
 Compiler and interpreter were developed in place of assembler
 ab computer program likhane ke liye masini bhashaa ko ankiy kriyanvayan sanketo ke sthaan par akshar chinh smaranopkaaree kaa prayog kiya gaya
 The language used in computers in which programs are written using English letters, numbers and symbols is called high level programming language
 is bhashaa main program likhnaa programmer ke liye bahut hi aasaan hota he, kyonki isame kisi bhi nirdesh mashin code main badalakar likhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Such as - BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, PASCAL | Now high level programming languages have developed
 in programing bhashaao ko karyaanusaar chaar virgo main vibhajit kiya gaya he- vaigyanik programing bhashaaen- inkaa prayog mukhyat: vaigyanik kaaryo ke liye program banane main hota he, parantu iname se kuch bhashaaen ansi bhi hoti he jo vaigyanik kaaryo ke alaava anya kaaryo ko bhi utani hi dakshata se karti he
 Such as - ALGOL, BASIC, PASCAL, FORTRAN, etc
 vyavsaayik programing bhashaaen-vyapaarik kaaryo se sambandhit jaise-bahi khaataa, rozaanaamachaa, stock aadi kaa lekha jokha aadi vyapaarik programing bhashaao ke program dwaara atyant saralata se kiya ja saktaa he
 Such as PL1, COBOL, DBASE etc
 vishesh uddeshy programing bhashaaen-ye bhashaaen vibhinn kaaryo ko vishesh kshamta ke saath karne ke liye prayog kii jaati he
 Eg- APL360- Peripheral devices are used for best application

 in bhashaao main prayog kiye jane vaale shabd saamaanya angreji bhashaa main hote hai
 In these programming languages, the possibility of mistakes is less and mistakes can be found quickly and rectified
 prayog kiya gaya anuvadak compiler athwa interprator program main kis line or nirdesh main galati he yah swayan hi suchit kar detaa he
 It takes less time and labor to write a program
 in bhashaao main likhaa gaya program chalane main masini bhashaa or asembli bhashaa main likhe gayi program kii apeksha computer kii mukhya smriti main adhik sthaan gherta he
 These languages do not have flexibility because it is not under the control of the programmer due to the self-control of the translator
 lacheelepan se taatpary he ki kuch vishesh kaary in programing bhashaao main nahin kiye ja sakate hai athwa atyant kathinaayee se saath kiye ja sakate hai
 However, the features of a high-level programming language are more effective than its limitations
 at: vartmaan main yahi bhashaaen prayog kii jaati he
 If we look at the history of the development of programming languages, Dr
 Grace Hopper's name holds an important place
 inhone hi san 1952 ke aas-paas ucch stareey bhashaao kaa vikaas kiya tha
 In which a compiler was used
 dow haper ke nirdesan main do ucch stareey programing bhashaao ko viksit kiya gaya pehali-flowmatic or MATHEMATICS
 FLOWMATIC was a commercial programming language and MATHEMATICS was a language used in arithmetic calculations
 tab se lekar ab tak lagbhag 225 ucch stareey programing bhashaao kaa vikaas ho chukaa he
 Examples: FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, PASCAL

 Biologists have speculated that a large number of species are being forced to go extinct due to the destruction of rainforests with their habitat being removed
 
 Another factor causing the degradation of rainforests is the expansion of urban areas

 The forests are being destroyed at a rapid pace

 Since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago, Madagascar has lost two-thirds of its original rainforest

 According to a WWF news report, deforestation will destroy about 60 percent of the Amazon rainforests by 2030

 But Brazil has not only reduced deforestation overall but also slowed down the pace of deforestation

 isliye, kuch deshon ke ek samooh main apwaad hai jahaan wanon kii kataai itani laabhadaayak he ki yah samruddhi ke vikaas main ek mahatvapurn hissaa ban gayi he
 The new goal is not just to prevent deforestation but to manage the forest for a long period, which occurs on a large scale

 Mach is the major folk theater form of Malwa
 lok maanas ke prabhavi manch maach ko ujjain main janm mila he
 The word Mach is related to the Sanskrit root stage
 is manch shabd ke maalavi main anek kshetron main prachlit parivartit rup milte hai
 For example- the meaning of many words like Macha, Machali, Machali, Macha, Machali, Machan expresses the sense of synonyms of the stage itself
 maach guru siddheshwar sen maach kii vyutpatti ke peeche sambhaavna vyakt karte hai ki maach ke pravartak guru gopalji ne sambhavtah krishi kii raksha ke liye ped par bane machaan ko dekha hoga, jis par chadhakar stri yaa purush aawaaj aadi ke madhyam se nuksaan pahunchaane vaale pashu-pakshiyon se khet kii raksha karte hai
 Guru Gopalji must have kept the word Machaan in mind and then made his stage name match based on the shape and form of the same Machan from the high place of theatrical performance
 kaalaantar main yahi naam prachlit ho gaya
 In fact, there has been enough synergy in the stage and scaffolding of Mach
 puraane daur main maach kaa manch itnaa adhik unchaa banaaya jaataa tha ki uske neeche se baiylgaadee bhi guzar jaati thi
 These days the height of the stage is usually normal
 bharat ke vibhinn anchalon main boli jane vaali lok-bhashaayen rashtrabhasha hindi kii samruddhi kaa pramaan hai
 Folk-languages and their literature are virtually renewable sources for Indian culture and nationalism
 ham inkaa jitna manthan karen, utane hi amuly ratna hamen milte rahenge
 In the era of perceived modernity, we are becoming alienated from our spoken, literary-culture
 aise samay main jitna visthaapan logon or samudaayon kaa ho rahaa he, usase kam lok-bhashaa or lok-sahitya kaa nahin ho rahaa he
 The dialects of home and courtyard are facing the pain of alienation in their own surroundings
 is disha main lokbhasha, sahitya or samskritipremiyon ke samgr prayaason kii darkaar he
 According to Prof
 Shailendrakumar Sharma, the heartland of India, Malwa, has somehow assimilated the entire Indian culture like a sea in Gagar
 malwa kii paramparaayen samooche bharat se prabhavit hui hai or puure bharat ko malwa kii samskruti ne kisi na kisi rup main prabhavit kiya he
 Malwa is the heart zone of India and its cultural capital is Ujjain
 ujjain kala ke adhishthata shiv or sarv-kala-ratna shrikrishna kii nagari he
 This city is credited with the birth of folk theater
 aaj kaa malwa sampoorn pashchimi madhyapradesh or uske saath simavarti purvi rajasthan ke kuch jilon tak vistaar liye hue he, jahaan maalavi or uski upboliyon kaa prayog hota he
 a traditional Doha prevails in relation to its boundary line according to which the land surrounded by the Chambal, Betwa and Narmada rivers should be considered as the boundary of Malwa - Its Chambal ut Betwa Malwa Seam Sujan
 dakshin disi he narmada yah puri pahchaan
 
 malwa kaa lok-sahitya kii drushti se atyant samrudh he
 The folk folk here have been finding expression through century-by-century story-telling, songs, songs, theatricals, puzzles, proverbs etc
 jivan kaa aisa koi prasang nahin he, jab maalvajan apane harsh-ullas, sukh-dukh ko darj karne ke liye lok-sahitya kaa sahaara na letaa ho
 The macho of Malwa occupies a special place in the Indian folk-drama tradition
 malwa kshetra kaa pratinidhi lok natya maach he, jo apni sudeergh parampara ke saath aaj bhi lok maanas kaa prabhavi manch bana hua hai
 a rich mach with the incorporation of folk songs, folk tales, folk-dance forms and folk-music of Malwa embodies the possibilities of the entire play
 lokmanas kii sahaj abhivyanjana or lok rang vyavhaaron kii saral rekhiy anayaastaa se upja yah lokanaty lokranjan or lok mangal ke prabhavi madhyam ke rup main sthapit he
 Mach has been agitating the vast population of malwa-rajasthan
 maach shabd sanskrit ke manch shabd kaa hi parivartit rup he
 Mach plays are called games, which are presented at Muktakashi Theater
 sangeet, nrity, paath, abhinay or bolon kii antah kriya maach ko ek sampoorn natya yaa yun kahen total theatre kaa rup de detii he
 Mach games have visions of social harmony, mutual love and spontaneous folk life
 maach ke darshakon main bhi ek khaas dhang kii rasikata dekhi ja sakati he
 Its audience is not just the audience, their interaction in the stage business is also shown
 maach ke kshetra main ujjain main anek gharaane bane, jinhone apane-apane dhang se maach ko nai urja, nai gati di
 Guru Gopal ji, Guru Balmukundji, Bhagirath Patel, Guru Ramkishan ji, Guru Radhakishenji, Ustad Kaluram ji, Pt
 Omprakash Sharma, Siddheshwar Sen, Fakirchand ji, Chunnilal ji, Anil Panchal etc
, carry forward the tradition of creation and staging of mach games There has been an unforgettable contribution to increase
 maach parampara ko guru bhairavalalji, shivajiram, shyaamadaas chakradhari aadi ne bhi aage badhaayaa
 There was a healthy competition between the various gurus of macho for the construction and demonstration of new mach
 vibhinn maach guruon dwaara maalavi main rache gaye lagbhag sava sau adhik maach ke khel milte hai, jinhen da
 madhur ne suvidha kii drushti se chaar bhaagon main baanta he - dharmik or puranic kathanak, shaury kathaayen, premakhyaan or saamaajik kathanak
 In all these types of games, along with the expression of different aspects of life, somewhere the emotional references of the human mind are expressed, sometimes the courageous and brave characters have to express their spirituality, and sometimes they are faced with the occasional problems
 try the
 vividhayami jivan sandarbhon kii abhivyakti ke saath hi ucchtam mulyon kii siddhi maach kii kendriya pravriti rahi he, jo kahin puranic to kahin aitihaasik, kahin lok-prasiddh to kahin kaalpanik charitron ke madhyam se moort hoti he
 The ancient city of Machh on the Shipra coast is considered Ujjain
 lagbhag do sau se adhik varshon se maach malwa kaa pramukh lokanaty bana hua he
 Many folk art trends of Malwa have contributed to its emergence and development
 malwa kshetra main prachlit garabi geet, dhara-dhari ke khel, turra kalangi, nakal-swang kii pravriti, gammat, haajrat vidya aadi ko maach ke udbhav evam vikaas main mahatvapurn maanane waalon main da
 sivakumar madhur kaa pramukh naam he
 These folk art forms of Malwa include elements such as dance, singing and acting, spirituality, imitation-pretentiousness, nirguni devotional elements, the role of female characters by men, and many color behaviors, etc
 are still present in Mach
 da
 madhur ke anusaar- dhara-dhari ke khelon se abhinay, garba-utsav se sangeet, turrakalangi se kavy-gayan or swang-nakal pradarshnon se abhinay, haas-parihaas, chutile vyangy evam janamanoranjan ke tatva jutakar machakaaron ne is nai rang style ko panpaaya
 The effect of Loknatya Khyal prevalent in Rajasthan is also seen in the sports of Mach
 isiilie prasiddh itihasajna da
 raghuveerasingh ne khyaalon ko maachon kaa janak kaha he
 Guru Gopalji, the initiator of the Mach style, is believed to be originally from Rajasthan and later settled in Malwa
 aisa mana jaataa he ki guru gopal ji ne malwa kshetra main rajasthan ke khyaal jaisaa koi natya rup na paakar sthaneey sangeet or lokkala roopon ke samavesh se maach kii shuruuaat kii, jo parampara se kramshah parishkrut, sangrakshit or sanvardhit hota gaya
 Folk-dramas have been the most important contributors to the foundation of India's vibrant theater tradition
 lokmanas kii abhivyanjana ke liye uplabdh vividh madhyamon main se lok-natya hi apni teevr rasavatta or sahaj sampreshniyata ke bhashaagat antar ke baavjood ek antah sutara main jude dikhaai dete he
 The natural expression of Lokamanas seems to combine all these folk-drama forms into a single form
 yah swaabhaavik unki jatil bauddhikta se viheen bhavatmakataa se upajati he, jo kathanak, samvaad, geet-sangeet, nrity, pradarshan-style, rang-shilp, bhashaa aadi sabhi staron par spashtatah drushtigochar hoti he
 From this point of view, the folk-drama form of the Malwa region is no different from other folk theater forms in India
 usamen bhi vahiin lokranjata ke anukool sangeet, nritymulak abhinay evam pradarshan ke tatva, dharmikata ke saath hi saamaajik, rajnatik, lokkthamoolak or premakhyanparak kathankon kii bahulata tathaa shringaar, vir, karun or hasya rasmoolak atiranjit bhavapravanta or talleenta maujuud he, jo bharat ke anya lokanaty roopon jaise nautanki, khyaal,bhawai, tamaasha, kariyaala aadi main milte hai
 In fact, the aesthetic vision of all of these is just like Sanskrit plays
 isi tarah in lokanaty roopon main vaiyaktik sangharsh ke sthaan par vyakti evam samooh ke antah sambandhon kii pahchaan tathaa jivan kii anek sthitiyon se guzarakar ek tarah ke santulan kii dasha main darshakon ko le jane kii pravriti maujuud he, jisamen kahin lokmagal kii siddhi hoti he to kahin kaarunik ant ke baavjood lokadarsh kii sthapana
 There is a long list of creators who have practiced around one and a half hundred games in the world, from Guru Gopalji, the originator of Mach
 beesvin shatee ke shuruuaati dashakon main maach hi malwa kaa pratinidhi rangamanch tha jiske pradarshnon main raat-raat bhar saikadon darshakon kii bheed juty rahati thi
 Although there has been some decrease in the popularity and performance of the waning mach of the last century, the mach gurus have kept it alive today through its patronage and innovative experiments
