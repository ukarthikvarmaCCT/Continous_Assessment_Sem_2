 anant kaa arth hota he jiskaa koi ant na ho
 Let it be denoted by ∞
 yah ganit or darshan main ek concept he jo aisi raashi ko kehete hai jisaki koi seemaa na ho yaa ant na ho
 In the past, people have expressed different views about the eternal
 anant shabd kaa angreji paryaay "infinity" latin bhashaa ke 'in' or 'finnish' kii sandhi he
 This term is used for quantities whose steam or calculation is impossible due to their not being finite
 aparimit saral rekha kii lambaai simavihin or isliye anant hoti he
 The "infinite" prevalent in mathematical analysis is expressed as: yadi ya koi char he or pha koi ya kaa falan he or yadi ab char ya kisi sankhya k kii ore agrasar hota he tab pha is prakaar badhata hi chalaa jaataa he ki vah prayek di hui sankhya na se bada ho jaataa he or bada hi bana rahata he chaahe na kitna bhi bada ho, to kaha jaataa he ki ya = k ke liye pha kii seemaa anant he
 It is clear from the definition of fractions that fractions are the number that multiplies by s and gives the product
 yadi va, sa main se koi bhi shunya na ho to va / sa ek adwitiya raashi kaa nirupan karata he
 Then it is clear that 0 / s always remains the same, irrespective of the constant number
 ise parimey sankhyaon ko shunya kaha jaataa he or gananaatmak sankhya 0 ke samaan he
 Conversely, v / 0 is a meaningless term
 ise anant samajhnaa bhul he
 If a remains constant in a / y and y decreases and both a and z are positive, then the value of a / y will increase
 yadi ya shunya kii ore agrasar hota he to antatogatva k / ya kisi badi se badi sankhya se bhi bada ho jayega
 Cantor has expressed the problem of infinity in another way
 cantareey sankhyaayein, jo anant or saant ke vipareet hone ke kaaran kabhi-kabhi ateet sankhyaayein kahi jaati hai, jyamiti or simasidhant main prachlit anant kii paribhaasha se bhinn prakaar kii hai
 Cantor has described the shortest past computational number a as a count of the union of natural numbers 1, 2, 3



 lagata he ki bharatiyon ko anant kii sankalpana vaidic kaal se hi thi
 He was familiar with the basic qualities of eternal and many words have been used for this, such as - eternal, whole, aditi, innumerable etc
 asankhyat kaa ullekh yajurveda main aayaa he
 In the Isophanishad it has come- yahan 'purnasy poornamaadaay purnamevavshishyate' ko yon samajha jaataa he ki anant se anant ghataane par bhi anant hi shesh rahata he
 Hindi writer vinod kumaar shukla Vinod Kumar Shukla is a famous Hindi poet and novelist! Born on 1 January 1937 in Rajnandgaon in Chhattisgarh, a state in India, Shukla chose profession as a job and devoted his entire attention to literature creation! His strikingly different literary style influenced readers to break the convention in a fresh jolt, which could be felt as a genre around 'magical-reality'! His first collection of poems was published in 1971 under the name 'almost Jai Hind'! In 1979, his novel 'servant's shirt' came out, on which filmmaker Manikoul also made a film with the same name! Awarded with many honors, Vinod Kumar Shukla has received the 'sahitya Akademi' Award for the year 1999 for the novel 'wall mein a window rahi thi'

 He was sharp-witted, ambitious, confident and an extraordinary young man

 It was unbearable for him to be in control of any other person, due to which he became estranged from his Chancellor Bismarck after a few days
 paristhitiyon se baadhya hokar bismark ko tyaag-patr dena padaa
 After the fall of Bismarck, William took all power into his own hands and his ministers became obedient servants and he became the helm of his own rule
 wiliam kaisar atyadhik hathi, mahatvakankshi evam krodhi vyakti tha
 He used to say that our future depends on the sea
 uske germany ko samudri shakti banane ke prayaas ne england kii sthaayee shatruta praapt kar lee thi
 His policy was- 'to establish his dominion over the whole world
 ' yadi isamen use safalataa na mili to vah vishwa ke sarvanaash ke liye tatpar tha
 England was not in favor of war as a trading country, which William Kaiser considered England's cowardice
 vah akramak ruukh apanaakaar england ko bhaybheet kar apane samrajya kaa vistaar karnaa chahta tha or yah galat samaj thi ki england kisi bhi keemat par yuddh taalna chahega
 Thus William Caesar's fiery, imperialist, autocratic and autocratic personality put Europe on the brink of a great war
 kaisar wiliam dwitiya kii vishwa niti ke nimnlikhit teen mukhya uddeshy the - In order to fulfill the above objectives, Kaiser William II began to conduct Germany's 'foreign policy'
 pratham uddeshy ke kaaran austria ke saath ghanisht mail aavashyak tha, kyonki vah bhi usee disha main bad kar selonika ke bandargah par adhikaar karnaa chahta tha
 This meant strengthening the diplomatic group of Central Europe
 austria or rus ke hiton main sangharsh hone ke kaaran iskaa arth rus se alag hatana or ant main use apana virdohi bana lenaa bhi tha
 The fulfillment of the second objective meant 'to demonstrate the power of Germany wherever necessary in the world, especially in Africa
 ' is sambandh main morocco ne france ko do baar 1905 i
 or 1911 i
 main chunauti di
 a clear result of the fulfillment of the third objective was intense competition and disharmony with England
 saransh main is nai niti kaa swaabhaavik parinaam hona tha, rus, france or england kii shatruta or ant main in teenon kaa uske mukaable main ekatrit ho janaa, arthath bismark ke samast kaary kaa vinaash
 William II destroyed his entire system with his policy
 teen varsh ke andar rus germany se alag ho gaya or baad main france se sandhi karke usne uske ekaakipan kaa ant kar diya
 England became an enemy within 6 years

 tak germany, austria tathaa italy ke trigut ke mukaable main france, rus or england kii trirashtra maitri sthapit ho gai
 Italy's relationship with threesome was also getting relaxed, but William II did not make any effort in this direction
 1890 i

 Russia, too, refused the reiteration of this repatriation treaty, stating that 'the treaty is very complex and there is a threat to Austria, which can have disastrous consequences
 ' The apparent consequence of the non-recurrence of the Treaty of Resettlement was that Russia remained alone
 usko apane ekaakipan ko dur karne ke liye ek mitra kii khoj kerani anivaary ho gai
 Now England and France were his enemies in front of him
 kintu apni paristhiti se baadhya hokar vah france se mitrataa karne kii ore aakarshith hua or usase mitrataa karne kaa praytn karne laga
 Finally, in 1895 AD, the treaty took place in both the countries, which is known as the Dwight Treaty
 is sandhi se france ko atyadhik laabh hua or uskaa akelaapan samaapt ho gaya
 William was very ambitious
 vah germany ko europe kaa bhagya-nirmaataa hi nahin, varan vishwa kaa bhagya-nirmaataa bananaa chahta tha
 Bismarck wanted to keep Germany apart from world conflicts, but William started interfering in conflicts outside of Europe
 vah keval balkan prayadweep main hi german-prabhaav se santusht nahin tha, varan vah to usko vishwa-shakti ke rup main dekhnachahta tha
 For this purpose, world-wide policy was incorporated into Germany's foreign policy after 1890 AD
 wiliam ke anek bhaashanon se uske in vichaaron kaa digdarshan hota he
 He gave these territories in his possession - wiliam turki ko apane prabhaav-kshetra ke antargat laana chahta tha or yah uski vishwa niti kaa ek pramukh ang tha
 England was also trying in this direction
 vah kisi europea raashtra kaa prabhutv turki main sthapit nahin hone dena chahta tha, kyonki aisa hone se uske bhartiya samrajya ko bhay utpann ho saktaa tha
 England was dominated by Turkey until the berlin-congress of 1878, and whenever a European nation thought of making progress towards it, England strongly opposed it, but after the Cyprus agreement, its influence would be less than on Turkey
 felt
 jab england kaa 1882 i
 main misr par adhikaar hua to england or turki ke madhya jo rahi-sahi sadbhaavna vidyaman thi uskaa bhi ant hona aarambh ho gaya
 Now William II took advantage of this situation and tried to bring Turkey into his sphere of influence
 is sambandh main usne nimna upaay kiye- There was also the construction of a rail till Kustuntunia
 is maarg ke khul jane se germany kaa sampark faras kii khadi tak ho jaataa jo england ke bhartiya samrajya ke liye vishesh chintaa kaa vishay ban jaataa
 William must have succeeded in attracting Turkey, but by this policy he made Russia, France and England his enemy, while the power of Turkey was negligible in front of these three big nations
 wiliam kii is niti ko safal niti nahin kaha ja saktaa
 He unhappy the three nations together, as a result of which it was possible to form a three-party faction
 1890 i
 tak germany or england ke sambandh achche the, kintu jab wiliam dwitiya ke shasankaal main germany ne vishwavyaapee niti ko apnaanaa aarambh kiya to germany or england ke sambandh katu honearambh ho gayi
 After Bismarck's resignation, William began to expand in the German navy, England became increasingly suspicious of Germany's growing power
 kuch samay takadonon main maitri kaa haath badha, kintu 1896 i
 ke uparaant donon ke sambandh katu hone aarambh hote gayi
 When William sent a telegram of congratulations to the President of Transvaal, Kruger, conquering James's invasion
 is taar se england kii janata main bada kshebh utpann hua
 Queen Victoria also strongly condemned this work of her grandson William II
 is samay england ne germany se sambandh bigaadna uchit nahin samajha, kyonki aisa karne par vah akelaa rah jaataa
 For this purpose, he tried to establish good relations with Germany
 1898 i
 main africa ke sambandh main tathaa 1899 i
 main senaaon ke sambandh main donon deshon ke samjhaute bhi hue
 In the same year, Joseph Chamberlain, the colonization minister of England, proposed the construction of a ternary in England, Germany and the United States, but in 1899, Beulo, who was then Prime Minister of Germany, did not accept the proposal
 uskaa is prastaav ke asweekaar karne kaa kaaran yah tha ki iske dwaara england kaa aashay yah he ki aagaamee yudhon main germany, england kaa paksh le or uske samarthak ke rup main yuddh main bhaag le or england europea mahadweep se nishcint hokar asia tathaa africa main apane samrajya kaa vistaar karata rahe
 Beulo was of the view that inconvenience to England was inevitable due to Germany's colonial, mercantilist and navigational advancement and could lead to war at both times
 atah germany kii nitiyon dwaara england bhalee prakaar samaj gaya ki germany par adhik vishwaas karnaa england ke liye ghaatak siddh hoga or vastav main ek din aisa avashya aayega jab england or germany kaa yuddh hoga
 Friendship between France and Russia had been established, now the work of friendship between Russia and England started by France
 1907 i
 main france ke praytn se rus or england kaa gut taiyaar ho gaya
 This group was defensive, but the German Emperor William II was concerned about its creation
 ab usne apana dhyaan is gut ke ant karne kii ore vishesh rup se aakarshith kiya
 At the same time, Germany had the opportunity to intervene in the eastern problem and humiliate Russia
 1908 i 
 turki main ek aandolan hua jo yuva turk aandolan ke naam se prasiddh he
 Austria soon took possession of Bosnia and Herzegovina
 srbija yah sahan nahin kar sakaa or usne yuddh kii taiyaari karnaa aarambh kar diya
 He hoped that Russia and England would be ready to help him against Austria and Germany, but Russia did not yet have such a situation
 austria ne srbija ke saath bada kathor vyavhaar kiya jiske kaaran yuddh kaa hona anivaary sa dikhne laga, kintu jab germany ne spasht ghoshnaa kar di ki yadi rus srbija kii kisi prakaar se sahaayta karegaa, to vah yuddh main austria kii purna rup se sahaayta karne ko taiyaar he
 Thus the war was averted
 is samay rus main itani shakti nahin thi ki vah germany or austria kii sammilit sevaaon kaa safaltaapurvak saamana kar saktaa
 Russia was forced to subdue and German politics succeeded in the Balkan Peninsula
 yadhyapi german-samraat wiliam kaisar balkan pradesh main rus ko nicha dikhalaane main safal hua or vah apane mitra austria kii shakti kaa vistaar tathaa prabhaav main vruddhi karvaa sakaa, kintu phir bhi vah france, rus or england ke gut se bhaybheet bana rahaa
 He began to move towards befriending France and Russia

 Germany accepted France's extraordinary position regarding Morocco's internal security
 idhar nishcint hokar germany ne apana dhyaan rus se samjhauta karne kii ore aakarshith kiya
 Germany signed an agreement with Russia in November 1910 regarding its interests in Mesopotamia and Persia, by which 'russia pledged not to oppose the berlin-baghdad railway plan to Germany, and William acknowledged Russia's interests in Persia
 Of
 ' By the above works, William II succeeded in weakening the faction of Russia, France and England, but this situation could not be sustained for long
 morocco ke prashn kaa samaadhaan karne kaa praytn france or germany dwaara kiya gaya tha, kintu donon samjhaute kii sthiti se santusht nahin the
 There was a natural opposition to the 'independence of Morocco' and the French police power, which was sure to cause a quarrel in the future
 france morocco ko purnataya apane adhikaar main laane par tula hua tha or germany use rokane yaa uske badale main upyukt puraskaar praapt karne par katibaddh tha
 1911 AD In Morocco, an incident occurred which attracted the attention of the major nations of Europe
 morocco main grihayuddh kii agni prajjwalit hui or morocco kaa sultan is vidroh kaa daman karne main asafal rahaa
 After this situation arose, France sent an army, pretending to be responsible for internal security, which started suppressing the rebellion in Morocco on 21 May 1910 AD
 germany france ke is prakaar ke hastkshep ko sahan nahin kar sakaa or germany ke videshmantri ne ghoshnaa kii ki 'yadi france ko morocco main rahanaa aavashyak prathit hua to morocco kii purna samasya par punah vichaar kiya jaayegaa or eljisiraj ke act par hastakshar karne vaali samast sattaaon ko apni icchaanusaar kaary karne kii swatantraaa punah praapt ho jaayegi
 After the suppression of the foreigners, the French forces returned, but even then Germany did not think it necessary to make any changes in its strict behavior
 july 1910 i
 ko germany ne ghoshnaa kii ki usne german hiton tathaa german nivaasiyon kii raksha ke abhipraay se ek jangi jahaaj dakshini morocco ke agedir naamak bandargah par bhej diya
 This behavior of Germany created a very critical situation and it became clear that the possibility of war between the nations of Europe was inevitable soon
 ant main france or german ke madhya sandhi ho gai jo ki 4 navambar 1911 ko sampann hui, jiske anusaar yah nishchay hua ki morocco par france kaa sangrakshan purvawat bana rahe or germany ko french congon kaa aadha pradesh praapt hua
 Germany had to face the question of Morocco, because the three-nation faction of Russia, France and England was now more firm and stable than before and relations between Germany and England started getting worse day by day

 For example, if the original equation is y - 2 x = - 3 { \ displaystyle y - 2x = -3}, then it will be written as y = 2 x - 3 { \ displaystyle y = 2x - 3})
 y kaa yah maan shesh sabhi samikarnon main rakh denge
 Thus we had one less equation left than before and the unknown amount also became one less than before

 From this, we assume the unknown amount contained in it and by substituting it in the reverse order, the value of other unknown amounts is determined

 biharilal yaa bihari hindi ke reeti kaal ke prasiddh kavi the
 Bihari Lal was born around 1595 in Gwalior
 ve jati ke maathur choube the
 His father's name was Keshavarai
 jab bihari 8 varsh ke the tab inke pita inhe orchha le aaye tathaa unka bachapan bundelkhand main beetaa
 His mentor was Keshavdas and his youth in-laws were spent in Mathura, as is evident from the following couplets - jaipur-naresh savai jaisingh apni nayi rani ke prem main itane duube rahete the ki ve mahal se baahar bhi nahin nikalate the or raaj-kaaj kii ore koi dhyaan nahin dete the
 Ministers and people were concerned that large, but the king was not in any strength to say something
 bihari ne yah kaary apane upar liya
 He somehow brought the following couplet to the king - is dohe ne raja par mantra jaisaa kaary kiya
 He was freed from the love loop of the queen and again took up his reign
 ve bihari kii kavy kushalta se itane prabhavit hue ki unhone bihari se or bhi dohe rachane ke liye kaha or prati dohe par ek asharfi dene kaa vachan diya
 Bihari started composing poetry in the court of Jaipur King, where he got enough money and fame
 bihari kii ekmaatr rachana satsai he
 This is a form of 'muktak' poetry
 isamen 719 dohe sankalit hai
 Certain couplets are also suspected
 sabhi dohe sundar or saraahneey hai tathaapi tanik vichaarpurvak baariki se dekhne par lagbhag 200 dohe ati utkrisht thaharte hai
 Braj language is used in 'satsai'
 brajabhasha hi us samay uttar bharat kii ek sarvamaanya tathaa sarv-kavi-sammanit grahya kavyabhasha ke rup main pratishthit thi
 Its publicity and spread had become so much that it was easily possible to come in many forms
 bihari ne ise ekarupata ke saath rakhane kaa stuty safal prayaas kiya or ise nishchit saahitiyik rup main rakh diya
 This brightened the Braj language
 satsai ko teen mukhya bhaagon main vibhakt kar sakate hai- niti vishyak, bhakthi or aadhyatm bhavaparak, tathaa shriganrapaparak
 Of these, the part of the prosthesis is more
 kalachamatkaar sarvatra chaaturya ke saath praapt hota he
 Rupang beauty, beautification, hero-heroine discrimination and how, Bhava, Vilas are described in the erotic part
 nayak-nayikanirupapan bhi mukht: teen roopon main miltaa he- pratham rup main nayak krishna or nayika radha he
 Religious and philosophical ideas have been taken into account while depicting them
 isliye isamen goodharth vyanjana pradhan he, or aadhyatmik rahasy tathaa dharmamarm nihit he; dwitiya rup main radha or krishna kaa spasht ullekh nahin kiya gaya kintu unke abhas kii pradipti di gai he or kalpanaadarsh rup rauchirya rachakar adarsh chitra vicitra vyanjana ke saath prastut kiye gaye hai
 This does not give the luxury of cosmic lust in it
 tritiy rup main loksambhav nayak nayika kaa spasht chitra he
 In this too, the imagination and skill of the poet traditional character is obtained in full
 nitant loukik rup bahut hi nune or bahut hi kam he
 Efforts have been made to sort the Muktak couplets of 'satsai'
 25 prakaar ke kram kahe jate hai jinamein se 14 prakaar ke kram dekhe gaye hai, shesh 11 prakaar ke kram jin tikaaon main hai, ve praapt nahin
 But no definite order could be given
 vastut: baat yah jaan padati he ki ye dohe samay-samay par muktak rup main hi rache gaye, phir chun chunakar ekatrit kar sankalit kar die gaye
 The idea is valid only with respect to invasive couplets
 yadi 'meri bhav baadha harau' is dohe ko pratham mangalacharnatmak arthath keval radhopaasa hone kaa vichaar spasht hota he or yadi 'mor mukut kati kachhini'-is dohe ko len, to keval ek vishesh banakwali krishnamurthi hi bihari kii abhishtopasya murti mukhya thaharti hai - bihari vastut: krishnopaa the, yah spasht he
 It is clear from the view of Satsai that for the Bihari, both the miracle and the narration skills are essential and necessary in the poetry of Rasa and ornament tact
 unke dohon ko do virgon main is prakaar bhi rakh sakate hai, ek varg main ve dohe aayengen jinamein ras rauchirya kaa prabalya he or rasaatmakataa kaa hi vishesh dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 The ornamental miracle is also there, but not a special one, but it is in the form of rasa only for the sake of maturity and expression
 duusare varg main ve dohe hai jinamein rasaatmakataa ko visheshta nahin di gai varan alankaar chamatkaar or vachanachaaturi athwa kathan-kalakaushal ko hi pradhanta di gai he
 Any particular ornamentation has been successfully treated with utterances
 is prakaar dekhte hue bhi yah maananaa padataa he ki alankaar chamatkaar ko kahin nitant bhulaayaa bhi nahin gaya
 While giving raska the flourishing, even the decking skill is not allowed to fall
 is prakaar kahana chahie ki bihari rasalankarsiddh kavi the; rassiddh hi nahin
 Literally couplets are hard to put into plushness, with them justification and commitment, the four-tier miracle is only effective and helpful
 yah baat nitiparak dohon main spasht rup se milti he
 Nevertheless, Bihari has made a commendable effort of succulence in them
 aisi hi baat darshanik siddhanton or dharmik bhav marmon ke bhi prastut karne main aati he kyonki unamem apni virasata swabhaavat: rahati he
 Yet Bihari has succeeded in presenting him with Sarasata
 bhakthi ke hardik bhav bahut hi kam dohon main dikhaai padate hai
 In particular, devotion arose in Bihari's emotional heart in particular and his expression was also there
 bihari main dainya bhav kaa praadhanya nahin, ve prabhu prarthana karte hai, kintu ati hin hokar nahin
 They consider the will of God as the main one
 bihari ne apane purvavarti siddh kaviwaron kii muktak rachanaaon, jaise aaryasptshati, gathasptshati, amarukshatak aadi se mulbhaav liye hai- kahin un bhaavon ko kaat chhantakar sundar rup diya he, kahin kuch unnat kiya he or kahin jyon kaa tyon hi sa rakhaa he
 The beauty is that a successful attempt has been made to keep long gestures in a concise form leaving their mark with elegance
 'satsai' par anek kaviyon or lekhakon ne tikaayen likhin
 a total of 54 vaccines have been received mainly
 ratnakar ji kii tikaa ek prakaar se antim tikaa he, yah sarvang sundar he
 The translations of Satsai have also been done in Sanskrit, Urdu etc
 and some poets have specialized in Kundalia etc
 verses clarifying the couplets of Satsai
 anya purvaparavarti kaviyon ke saath bhavsamya bhi prakat kiya gaya he
 Some commentaries are written in Persian and Sanskrit
 tikaakaron ne satsai main dohon ke kram bhi apane apane vichaar se rakhe hai
 Also, the number of couplets is also modular
 yah nitant nishchit nahin ki kul kitne dohe rache gaye the
 It is possible that those who came to Satsai would have chosen more than 700 couples
 saare jivan main bihari ne itane hi dohe rache hon, yah sarvatha maanya nahin thahartaa
 Some critics have written their criticisms on 'satsai'
 reeti kavy se hi isaki aalochana chalati aa rahi he
 The first poets wrote couplets and verses signifying the poignant feature of Satsai
 urdu ke shaayaron ne bhi isi prakaar kiya
 As: is prakaar kii kitni hi uktiyaan prachlit hai
 Critical books on Satsai have also been written extensively
 saath hi aadhunik kaal main isaki kai tikaayen bhi prakashit hui hai
 He was specially compared to Kavivar Dev and on the one hand, Dev was tried to prove it better than Bihari
 do pustaken, 'dev or bihari' pan
 krishnavihari mishra likhit tathaa 'bihari or dev' lala bhagavanadin likhit ullekhneey hai
 The commentary titled 'bihari Ratnakar' edited by Ratnakar ji and the critical interpretation called 'kavivar Bihari' are particularly observable and authentic
 bihari kii kavita kaa mukhya vishay shringaar he
 He has described both the coincidence and disconnection aspects of makeup
 sanyog paksh main bihari ne haavbhaav or anubhavon kaa bada hi sookshm chithran kiya hai
 It contains a lot of poignancy
 sanyog kaa ek udhaaharan dekhie - Bihari's disconnection, description is very exaggerated
 yahi kaaran he ki usamen swaabhaaviktaa nahin he, virah main vyakul nayika kii durbalata kaa chithran karte hue use ghadi ke pendulum jaisaa bana diya gaya he - The nonviolent method of Sufi poets has also had a substantial impact on Bihari
 viyog kii aag se nayika kaa sharir itnaa garm he ki us par daalaa gaya gulab jal bich main hi suukh jaataa he - Bihari is basically a Shringari poet
 unki bhakthi-bhaavana radha-krishna ke prati he or vah jahaan tahaan hi prakat hui he
 This Doha of mangala-charan at the beginning of Satsai is a reflection of his devotion to Radha - bihari ne niti or gyaan ke bhi dohe likhe hai, kintu unki sankhya bahut thodi he
 See a couplet regarding wealth collection - prakruti-chithran main bihari kisi se peeche nahin rahe hai
 He has very beautiful description of six objects
 greeshm ritu kaa chitra dekhie - Bihari villagers ridicule Aristotle and say- bihari ko jyotish, vaidyak, ganit, vigyaan aadi vividh vishyon kaa bada gyaan tha
 So they have used it a lot in their couplets
 ganit sambandhi tathy se paripurna yah doha dekhie - The language of Bihari is the literary Braj language
 isamen sur kii chalati braj bhashaa kaa viksit rup miltaa he
 The words of Eastern Hindi, Bundelkhandi, Urdu, Farsai etc
 have also come in it, but they do not hang
 bihari kaa shabd chayan bada sundar or sarthak he
 Words have been used in a very favorable way and not a single word seems to be of Bharati
 bihari ne apni bhashaa main kahin-kahin muhaavaron kaa bhi sundar prayog kiya he
 like - vishay ke anusaar bihari kii style teen prakaar kii he Although examples of calm, humor, compassion etc
 are also found in Bihari's poetry, but the main rasa is adornment
 bihari ne keval do hi chand apanaae hai, doha or soratha
 Doha is the predominance of verses
 bihari ke dohe samaas-style ke utkrisht namoonay hai
 It was the work of a poet like Bihari to fill many expressions in small verses like couplets
 alankaaron kii kaarigari dikhaane main bihari bade patu hai
 Some ornamentation has come in each of their couplets
 kisi-kisi dohe main to ek saath kai-kai alankaaron ko sthaan mila he
 Exaggeration, Eloquence and Sangrupak are Bihari's special favorite ornaments
 See an example of allegorical ornaments - kisi kavi kaa yash uske dwaara rachit granthon ke pariman par nahin, gun par nirbhar hota he
 The same is with Bihari
 akele satsai granth ne unhen hindi sahitya main amar kar diya
 No one got the same reputation as Bihari Satsai in Shringar Rasa's texts
 is granth kii anek tikaaen huin or anek kaviyon ne iske dohon ko aadhaar bana kar kavitt, chappay, savaiya aadi chhandon kii rachana kii
 Bihari Satsai continues to be a poetry-debacle of the rasikas even today
 kalpana kii samaahaar shakti or bhashaa kii samaas shakti ke kaaran satsai ke dohe gaagar main sagar bhare jane kii ukti charitaarth karte hai
 It is rightly said about them - apane kavy gunon ke kaaran hi bihari mahakavy kii rachana na karne par bhi mahakaviyon kii shrenee main gine jate hai

 mahaan caltech bhautikashastri richard phenman ke anusaar vigyaan, brahmad ke niyamon kaa pataa lagane ke prayaas ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Physics begins with a relative object
 koi bhi bhautik raashi apane maatrak athwa kisi anya raashi kaa maapan kisi anya char raashi ke saapeksh kiya jaataa he
 a point of reference is required to indicate the position of any object or particle in the problem

 By the end of this century, the ideology of Kant and Hegel had spread throughout Europe, especially the new Hegelist stream had developed extensively in America, England and Russia
 higeleey darshan main gyanoplabdhi ke liye tark ko sarvopari sthaan diya gaya
 Reality is rational and what is rational is reality

 The reality is advaita, timeless and timeless
 yah amoort he, isliye ise tarkshastra, ganit evam jyamiti kii paddati se hi janaa ja saktaa he
 In this ideology, along with despising the subordination, desire and sensation, the sensory world was also denied
 is prakaar mashtishk evam hriday ke bich tanaav kaaphi bad gaya
 Contemporary philosophy emerged in opposition to the above ideology
 darshan kaa yah yug pranalivirohi rahaa he
 This trend gradually progressed towards anarchy
 duusare, vyaktigat anubhavon ko adhik mahatv diya gaya
 Metaphysics was strongly attacked
 iske liye kisi skool ne dharm or manovigyaan kaa aashray liya, kisi ne anubhuti kaa, to kisi ne vigyaan or taarkik vishleshan kaa
 Then the principles of metaphysics were established on a new level
 samuul alexander, nikolai hartman evam alfred north hwhiteead iske udaahan hai
 William James gave substantial importance to religious experiences, and psychological truths
 james ne higel ke purvanirdhanrit evam gatiheen jagat kii katu aalochana kii
 According to him, reality is variable and its knowledge can only be through sensations
 falat: chetnapravah kaa siddhant prastut kiya gaya
 The reality of the country period was accepted as reality
 james ne "vishwaas kii ichha" kaa siddhant pratipaadit kiya, jiske anusaar, vishwaas kii kasuti tathy nahin, safalataa he
 This ideology is called Pragmatism or Pragmatism
 isamen vaastaviktaa kii ja kalpana kii gai vah vyapaarvaad, avasarwaad evam swaarthwaad kii ore prerit karti he
 John Dewey, Schiller, Charles Pearce and James himself were well-known lecturers of this ideology
 francisi darshanik henry bergasaan ne james ke drushtikon kii prashansa kii
 But he considered utility to be intellectual
 isliye upyogita evam buddhi donon gyaan praapt karne main baadhak batalaai gayi
 Bergsan gave importance to meditation, spontaneity and basic tendencies
 jivan evam parivartan ko vaastaviktaa ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 According to him, the material world, which is situated in the country, is intelligible and the period in which everything is located is intuitive
 vargsaan kaa darshan ek tarah se navy platowadi parampara kaa sudhara hua rup he
 He has tried to coordinate mysticism with the reality of progress and time
 19veen shatee ke ant main german pratyaywad ke viruddh vidroh hone lage the
 In addition to James and Bergsan, logicians also found faults in the hegemony system
 yadi ek ore taarkik bhavvaad bhashiya vishleshan ke madhyam se aage aayaa to astitvvaad nai or jatil bhashaa lekar udit hua
 Edmund Husserl, influenced by the ideas of Franz Brantano, formulated the theory of phenomenology
 kabhi kabhi ek hi skool ke bheetar matvabhinnya evam aspashtataa kii bharmaar milti he
 In a way the original trend has been anarchic and atomistic due to being anti-systemic
 dwandvatmak bhautikwaad rus evam china kaa rashtriya darshan hone ke kaaran sabase adhik prabhaavshaalee darshan rahaa he, kyonki saidhantik evam vyaavhaarik, donon pakshon se use jivan main grahan kiya gaya
 Such use of philosophy for life is nowhere in contemporary society
 marks evam angels ne isaki sthapana kii, jise lenin, plakhanov, stalin evam maautsetung ne aage viksit kiya
 Here it will suffice to give a brief introduction of logical sentimentality, phenomenology and existentialism
 kintu iske pehle hamen navy tamswaad par kuch shabd kah dena chahie
 Jacques Merten tried to modernize the ideas of Thomas Aquinas, but this philosophy is basically based on religious teachings
 vyaktivaadee pravriti se bhinn hote hue bhi, isamen ishwar ke prati aatmasamarpan kii shiksha hi mahatvapurn samajhi jaati he
 There has been an interpretation of Gyanamimamsa etc
, but only moral and religious teachings have been able to occupy the top position
 falat: yah cathalik carch kaa darshan ban kar rah gaya
 Sometimes they call themselves existentialists in real sense
 kintu ishwar, aatma, swarg aadi kii kalpanaaon ko adhik mahatv dene ke kaaran ve bhautik jivan ko tiraskrit karte hai or unhen astitvvaadi nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Parasitism is the main philosophical stream of the 19th century
 mukhyat: franz brantano ke vichaaron kaa aadhaar banaakar edmund husarl ne ise viksit kiya
 After Germany, its influence spread throughout Europe
 moore, hartman ityadi par pratibhasawad kaa alag alag prabhaav padaa
 The name of Max She is notable among the contestants
 is siddhant ke anusaar darshan kaa pratibhaas he
 The meaning of talent is, whatever the given object becomes the subject of cognition
 falat: prakruti vigyaan ke vipareet yuddh apanaate hue bhi sah pratyaywad se bhi alag padataa he
 Parasitism does not initiate studies with epistemology
 duusari visheshta yah he ki pratibhasawad saratatvon ko vishaywastu ke rup main chunata he
 These essences are genius and perceptive
 ye pratyakshanubhuti kii kriya main man main chhot jate hai isiilie ise saratatvon kaa darshan bhi kehete hai
 In addition to Edmund Husserl Frantz Brantano, the influence of scholasticism, new Kantism, etc
 is evident
 ganit main unka vishesh adhyayan he
 He has tried to refute nomism, agnosticism, sentimentalism etc
 through the medium of phenomenology
 husarl ne apane arth ke siddhant ke anumaan maansik pratyayon, bimbon, avadharanaon, ghatnaon, anubhavon aadi kii vyakhya karne kaa praytn kiya he
 As a result, his theory ceases to be a paradigmist in the end
 pratibhasavaadi paddati ko darshan ke vigyaan ke rup main viksit karne ke liye husarl ne ise pratyakshanubhuti se shu degree kiya he
 In the general sense "by the action of seeing" - what they call the dominant consciousness that directly represents the given objects
 yah mul vastu kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye anivaary saadhan he
 This is the first law of phenomenology
 ham chetana main vastuon ko jis rup main dekhte hai, vah unka arth he, is pradutt ko pratibhaas kehete hai, kyonki vah chetana main pratibhasith haata he
 Apart from phenomena, no agnostic element is given importance in phenomenology
 falat: yah anubhavik yaa nigamaatmak paddati ko mahatv nahin detaa
 This is related to the interpretation of conferred
 is prakaar saratatvon kii ore hi iskaa aagrah hota he
 The subject's action can also be the object of its study
 kintu sarvapratham gyaat, sandehaaspad, premamulak vastuon ko hi grahan kiya jaataa he
 According to Husserl, everything consists of its essence
 yadhyapi prayek vastu sambhavya yaa anishchit vaastaviktaa hoti he, phir bhi usamen saar tatv hota he, jise shuddh pratyay kah sakate hai
 In this way, Pratibhavasavad studies essences through intellectual intuition
 anubhavathit newnikaran ke madhyam se in saratatvon kii khoj kii jaati he
 The principle of "intentionality" is also associated with this principle
 isamen chetana or isaki kriyaaon kaa adhyayan hota he
 According to Husserl, different divisions of the organism determine the extent of phenomenology
 isamen se ek he- shuddh chetana
 Achieve this on the basis of "intentionality"
 samiprayikta is shuddh chetana se sambandhit hoti he
 Love, taste, etc
 are consciousness, these are practical experiences
 ye sabhipraayik anubhav jis vastu ko grahan karte hai, use sampurna rup se jaan lete hai
 Experience itself is pure action
 sabhipraayik vastu or shuddh chetana kaa sabhipraayik sambandh hi yah kriya he
 Thus the entire reality is pure action
 sabhipraayik vastu or shuddh chetana kaa sabhipraayik sambadh hi yah kriya he
 Thus the entire reality is empirical as a pure action
 anubhavpravaah main hi adriya padaarth ev sabhipraayik rup kaa antar spasht karte hue, sabhipraayik anubhavprakriya kii gudh vyakhya karte hai
 In the end, they complete their theory in accordance with suffragist theories
 taarkik bhavvaad kii prishthbhumi main kaant, mil, maakh, hum ityadi kaa prabhaav mahatvapurn he

 The influence of the physical sciences of Moore, Butland Russell, Whitehead and Einstein is also clearly targeted at this branch
 kintu is skool kaa sanghathan vienna main morij shlik kii adhyakshata main hua
 Erketinis was the mouthpiece of this school, later renamed "journal of Unified Science"
 praha, koningsburg, kapenhagen, paris or cambridge main isaki mahatvapurn baithken huin
 This school's "international Encyclopedia of Unified Science" was published from USA
 is skool ke pratinidhi mukhyat: germany, britain, france or america rudalph karnap hans rikhenbakh, shlik, otto neurath, i

 ir, gilbert ril, jaan visdam aadi kaa naam mahatvapurn he
 The linguistic analysis of Ludwig Vittigsteinine has a profound influence on this school
 in saare vyaktiyon main paraspra matbhed he, phir bhi ve tark, ganit or vigyaan ko ek swar se vaastaviktaa kaa saadhan maanate hai
 This school made a fatal attack on metaphysics
 taarkik bhavvaad ke anusaar tatvamimasaa ne bhashaa ke niyamon kaa ulanghan kiya he
 Therefore it is necessary to analyze it
 ""pramanikaran"" kii paddatti se tatvamimasaa kaa adhyayan karne ke baad kaha gaya ki uske saare vaakya "arthhin" hai
 God, soul, immortality etc
 cannot be attested
 darshan kaa kaam vaastaviktaa kii khoj karnaa nahin, balki vaigyanik vaakyon kaa adhyayan karnaa he
 In this way, if any sentence meets the principle of authentication, it can be said to be meaningful, otherwise it is meaningless
 tatvamimasaa kii samasyaon ko ghisi pity samasyaayen kahkar uda diya gaya
 Thus logical sentimentism is analytical philosophy in its basic form
 bhashaa kaa taarkik vishleshan ityadi siddhanton se lagata he ki taarkik bhavvaad vastuvaadi vishleshan ityadi siddhanton se lagata he ki taarkik bhavvaad vastuvaadi siddhant he
 But from the point of view of epistemology it falls close to Verkley's subjective suffixism
 yadhyapi yah vaigyanik sanket, pratik, vaakyon ityadi kii shabdaarth vigyaan ke anusaar vyakhya karata he, tathaapi ise bahya jagat main vishwaas nahin he
 According to logical rationalism, we cannot have knowledge of the external world
 ham sirf apane samvedon ko jaan sakate hai, bas
 What a rose is in itself cannot be said
 lekin vah laal he, sugandhit or komal he, yahi kaha ja saktaa he
 The rose we know is made from our senses
 yaheen is darshan kii seemaa samaapt hoti he
 Existentialism emerged after the Second World War
 kintu is parampara main romantic kavi, sahityakar evam vichaarkon kaa naam liya ja saktaa he
 Sarain Kirkgaard continued to attack Hegel's principles
 kircuguard ne sarvabhakshi pratyay se vyakti ko surakshit karne kaa prayaas kiya
 According to him, existence is first, essence is secondary
 tark se vaastaviktaa kaa gyaan asambhav he
 For this, faith, love, feeling etc
 are needed
 prativivekwaad kii neenv kircuguard ne daali, isi par puraa astitvvaad khadaa hua
 Nietzsche's name is also very important in this context
 vaise is vaad par husarl, bergasaan, dilthi kaa vyapak prabhaav he
 The principal lecturers of this school are Hedgar, Marcel, Karl Yaspers, and Jeanpal Sarch
 vichaarkon ne apane apane mat kaa adhiktar vyaktigat anubhavon ke aadhaar par vyakt kiya he
 But all have some common similarities, so that they prove to be thinkers of a school
 astitvvaad main mrityu ko darshan kaa aarambhik bindu mana gaya he
 According to Yaspers, philosophicalism means learning how to achieve death
 hedgar kii "mrityu kii prerana" or saatr kaa "nasia" iske duusare rup hai
 It is said that the problem of existentialism is the existential problem of man
 "astitv" hi is skool ke anusaar adhyayan kii mul vastu he
 People have given different definitions of existence
 kintu in sabake anusaar, astitv aadmi ke astitv ke atirikt koi duusari vastu nahin he
 Man is his own existence
 falat: vah atmonmukh vaastaviktaa he
 But this reality is real
 aadmi swayan apana nirmaan karata he or yah nirmaan uski swatantraaa siddh karata he
 Sartre is a staunch atheist
 duusare log ishwar kii alag alag kalpana karte hai
 In spite of this, people have described death, fear, suffering, freedom , failure, responsibility etc
 in the same sense
 astitvvaad kaa mul swar nirashaavadi he
 The prohibitive aspects of life are considered more in that
 saamanyat: yah sweekaar kiya gaya he ki aadmi bhagyadhin he or charam rup se vah apni paristhitiyon main nirdhaarit he
 Most of his definitions have become uncompromising and arduous due to vague and fabricated idioms
 ek arth main, isamen anubhavon kaa atirek ke saath varnan hua he
 Social relations have been studied mainly at psychological and philosophical level
 astitv duusare ke liye, sampreshan, tuun, ityadi shabdon se is sambandh kaa vishleshan kiya gaya he
 Metaphysics has got enough space in existentialism
 falat: pratyayvaadee pravriti se yah skool mukt nahin ho sakaa he
 Sufficient examples of this are present in Yaspers, Hedgar and Sartre

 Hamsaya is a Hindi language film made in 1968
 saanchaa:deshaanusaar asia main masjidenyah bharat main masjidon kii suchi he: Nimbarkacharya was a famous philosopher of India who propounded the philosophy of Dvaitadvaita
 unka samay 13veen shatabdi mana jaataa he
 However, the Nimbark community believes that Nimbark was born in 3096 BC
 nimbark kaa janmasathan vartmaan andhra pradesh main he
 Nimbarkacharya, who established Shri Krishna as the soul of Sanatan culture, is considered to be the oldest among the Vaishnavacharyas
 radha-krishna kii yugalopasna ko pratishthapit karne vaale nimbarkacharya kaa pradurbhaav karthik poornima ko hua tha
 According to the belief of devotees, the emergence of Acharya Nimbarka is said to be contemporary with Krishna's great-grandson Bajranabha and Parikshit's son Janamejaya in the post-kaal period
 inke pita arun rishi kii, shrimadbhagwat main parakshit kii bhagwatakatha shravan ke prasang sahit anek sthanon par upasthiti ko vishesh rup se batalaaya gaya he
 However, modern researchers prove the period of Nimbark between Vikram's 5th century and 12th century
 sampradaay kii manyatanusaar inhen bhagwaan ke pramukh aayudh ‘sudarshan’ kaa avatar mana jaataa he
 He was born in Arunashran of Vaiduryapatna
 inke pita arun muni or inaki mata kaa naam jayanti tha
 At the time of birth, he was named Niyamanand and settled in Braj during his childhood
 manyatanusaar apane guru naarad kii ajna se niyamanand ne govardhan kii talahati ko apni sadhana-sthali banaaya
 This boy was very miraculous since childhood
 ek baar govardhan sthit inke ashram main ek divabhoji yeti aayaa
 Naturally, the scriptures were discussed but a lot of time was spent in it and it was sunset
 yeti bina bhojan kiye jane laga
 Then the child Niyamananda pointed to the neem tree and said that it is not yet sunset, you should go after eating
 lekin yeti jaise hi bhojan karke uthaa to dekha ki raatri ke do pahar biit chuke the
 Since then, this child has been named 'nimbark', that is, the person who brings out extracts on the nimbus
 nimbarkacharya ne brahmasutra, upanishad or gita par apni tikaa likhakar apana samgr darshan prastut kiya
 His commentary is famous as 'vedanta Parijat Saurabh'
 inkaa mat ‘dwaitadvait’ yaa ‘bhedabhed’ ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to Acharya Nimbark, Jeeva, Jagat and Brahma have a real estrangement relationship
 nimbark in teenon ke astitv ko unke swabhaav, gun or abhivyakti ke kaaran bhinn maanate hai to tathvik rup se ek hone ke kaaran teenon ko abhinn maanate hai
 According to Nimbark, the worshiper Radhakrishna is the only Brahman
 dosarvapalli radhakrishnan ne apni suvikhyath pustak ‘bhartiya darshan’ main nimbark or unke vedant darshan kii charchaa karte hue likhaa he ki nimbark kii drushti main bhakthi kaa taatpary upasna na hokar prem anuraag he
 The Lord is always present for the benefit of his devoted devotee

 Americanization in countries other than the United States refers to the influence of American culture on the culture of other countries
 yah shabd kam se kam 1907 se prayog kiya ja rahaa he
 The prevailing meaning of the idea of 'americanization' is the result of criticism of the world-domination of American media companies
 mote taur par ise samskruti-udyog or saanskrithik samrajyavad ke paryaay kii tarah bhi dekha jaataa he
 But there are some aspects that separate Americanization from these two
 inamen pramukh he americakaran kii abhivyakti kaa europee samskritiyon dwaara prayog
 The rich countries of Western Europe are an integral part of America in politics, economics and strategy, but in terms of culture they object to the propaganda character of the United States culture
 is drushti se americakaran poonjeewaadi saanskrithik shivi ke antarvirodhon kaa parichaayak bhi he
 The g-seven countries such as France, Germany and Italy recognize that American ideology, lifestyles, and trends through television programs, Hollywood films, pop music and food are pushing their own cultural values and traditions into the background Huh
 udhaaharan ke liye italy ke aalochak yah dekh kar chintit hai ki unki janata pasta kii jagah hamburger tathaa opera kii jagah maaikel jackson sareekhee sangeet-nrity parampara ko uttarottar apanaati ja rahi he
 Likewise, the French and Germans, who were at the dose of considering their language as the best, are beginning to face cultural fears that the American intellectuals are increasing their intellectual and cultural influence
 americakaran kaa yahi arth dhire-dhire asian samskritiyon ke pairokaron dwaara bhi bhoomandaleekaran kii aalochana ke ek ahm muhaavarey kii tarah apanaaya jane laga he
 Idioms such as 'cocacolization' or 'mcdonalization' are often used among critics of globalization
 america samskruti ke sankramak charitra ke prati bhay bhoomandaleekaran kii vishwavyaapee prakriya shuru hone ke kaaphi pehle se vyakt kiye ja rahe hai
 From the standpoint of working-class culture, the British Sociologist and founder of the Birmingham Center for the Cultural Studies, Richard Hogart, published in 1957, 'the Uses of Literacy', offered a broad critique of Americanization
 hogart ne america or british lokapriy upanyaason kii tulana karte hue aarope lagaaya tha ki america upanyaason main sex or hinsa kaa sandarbhchyut istemaal kiya jaataa he
 Through an analysis of the British 'milk bars' of the fifties, Hogart identified the influence of America on British youth by showing how 'modern' and 'cool' in the American style became popular among them
 hogart ko is baat main koi andeh nahin tha ki america se aa rahi ye saanskrithik hawaayen ‘jivan-virdohi’ hai
 It is an interesting fact that the process of Americanization that European countries are objecting to today gained its base after World War II and during the Cold War
 ek tarah se yah americakaran vishwayuddh se jarjar ho chuke europe kii aavashyaktaa tha
 This was the period when the American business model pushed back local business formats of the Euro due to its success
 vyavsaay prabandhan ke liye emb kii degree mukhyatahpahale keval america main di jaati thi, lekin aaj yah degree europe samet duniya bhar main kushal vyavsaay-prabandhan kaa paryaay maani jaati he
 The 'efficiency movement' promoted by the US was assimilated by the economic and intellectual culture of European countries at least sixty-seventy years ago
 is andolan ke tahat hue susangateekaran ke dauraan europe main na keval mashiinon or kaarakaanon ke madhyam se badi hui utpaadakta hasil kii gayi, balki isse madhyavargeey or shramikwargeey janata ke jivan-str main bhi kaafii sudhaar aayaa
 The movement was targeted as an attack by the Nazis in Germany and by communists in other parts of Europe, but its social acceptance has become an undeniable fact
 america se vyapaarik samskruti kaa pravaah kis tarah ekatarfa rahaa he, yah nivesh ke aankadon se spasht ho saktaa he
 Between 1950 and 1965, US investment in Europe increased by eight hundred percent, while Europe's investment in the US increased by only 15 to 28 percent
 america nivesh main hui jabardast vruddhi ke peeche america praudyogikeey shreshthata kii bhoomika bhi rahi he
 After the end of the Cold War, Western Europe is no longer a military threat from the Soviet camp
 arthath apane rakshak ke rup main ab use america kii jarurat pehle kii tarah nahin he
 The European Union has also been created, and Europe is competing with the US as a unified economic structure
 is nayi sthiti ke parinamswaroop aaj america nivesh, america vigyapanon, vyapaarik taur-tareekon, karmchaaree sambandhi nitiyon or america companiyon dwaara angreji bhashaa ke istemaal par aapattiyaan hone lagi hai
 It originated in France, which has now spread to all non-english speaking Europe
 europee aalochakon ko yah dekh-sun kar kaaphi uljhan hoti he ki america khud ko europee samaajon ke raajnneetik abhijanwaad ke mukaable kahin adhik loktantric, vargetar or aadhunik samskruti ke rup main pesh karata he
 In response, these critics claim that American influence is corrupting the interests of European societies in political and cultural circles
 lekin, americakaran kaa matlab hameshaa se hi nakaaratmak nahin tha
 Its positive aspects can be identified from the first decade of the twentieth century
 1907 se hi america ke bheetar iskaa hawala duniya kii duusari samskritiyon se vahaan rahane aaye samudaayon dwaara america reeti-rivaazon or pravritiyon ko apnaane kii prakriya ke rup main diya jaataa rahaa he
 This sequence is also seen as a phenomenon of 'melting pot'
 1893 main itihaaskaar fraderick jackson turnar ne ek lekh ke dwaara pehali baar is avadharana kaa prayog yah dikhaane ke liye kiya ki america samskruti or anya sansthaayen keval anglo-sexn logon kii dein nahin hai
 a variety of cultures have contributed to create them from Europe to settle in America
 iske baad dhire-dhire melting pot kaa muhaavara saanskrithik aatmsatikaran ke paryaay ke taur par lokapriy hota chalaa gaya
 It is necessary to mention here that even in intellectual fields, the effects of American culture are not viewed negatively by all parties
 samskruti-adhyayan ke kshetra main sakriy kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki baazaaroo samskruti ko nichi nigaah se dekhne ke bajaay saadhaaran janon dwaara use aatmsaat karne ke yatharth kii sakaaratmak samiksha kii jaani chahie
 They claim that public cultural encounters with American cultural products are not one-sided but differentiated and diversified
 hebdigi ne apni 1979 main prakashit rachana main dikhaaya he ki kis prakaar british shramikwargeey yuvakon ne america faishan or mujeec kii madad se apni apekshaakrit shaktiheen or adhinsth vargeey haisiyat main pratirodh kaa samavesh kiya he
 The US offers a fascinating view of a modern, free and romantic culture for British youth
 samskruti-adhyayan se nikle is tarah ke vidwaanon ne ‘dalas’ or ‘dianasti’ jaise america tivi serialon kaa vishleshan karke paaya ki unhen dekhte hue log jin nishkarshon par pahonchte hai, un par sthaneey parivesh kaa gaharaa asar hota he
 For example, the Arab audience watching 'dallas' accepts it as an example of Western decadence, while a Russian Jew considers it to be an assimilation of capitalism
 in vidwaanon ke anusaar america ko ek prabhutvshaalee shakti maanane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki use duniya kii saanskrithik asmita ke upar apana antim nirnay thopane vaali takat bhi maan liya jaae
 These people do not consider cultural flows unilateral, instead referring to bollywood entertainment in India, Latin America's 'telenovelas' and Japanese TV products against American winds
 in vidwaanon ne yah tark bhi diya he ki satellite licenson ke sasti dar par uplabdh hone se tivi kaarykram banane kii antarnihit raajnneeti main kaaphi vividhta aayi he
 In the media world during the first Gulf War, the 'gulf War TV Project' successfully raised the anti-war flag
