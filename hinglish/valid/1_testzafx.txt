 Fact: The Indian Council Act, 1892 failed to satisfy Indian leaders
 India's political circumstances forced British leaders to think of constitutional reforms in order to gain the support of moderate parties or liberals of the Indian National Congress
 shri gopal krishna gokhale, jo udaarvaadiyon ke netaa the, "bharat mantri" lord jon morle ke samaksh apane vichaar prastut karne ke liye unase milane england gaye
 Mr
 Gokhale assured Morley that there is an urgent need for constitutional reforms in India

 The Indian secretary of the liberal party, John Morley, and the Viceroy of India of the conservative party, Gilbert elliot-murray-caninmound, 4th Earl of Minto, opined that it was necessary to suppress the dissatisfaction arising from Lord Curzon's Bengal partition but repression for the stability of the British Raj It was not enough
 unka spasht mat tha ki bharat ke vafaadaar sambhraant varg or samaaj ke sanvardhansheel pashchimikrut varg ko ek naatakeey kadam uthaa kar santusht karnaa behad aavashyak tha
 In this way he introduced the Indian Council Act, 1909
 The main demand of the Indian National Congress was "a system of government like the autonomous British colonies" but to accept the demand that no desire was shown in the act

 According to the then custom, at the young age of twelve years, despite their great reluctance, they got married, but after two to three years, on the eve of the second marriage, they stubbornly asked for mother and ate milk

 The next day after Baba had eaten milk and rice, the news of the bride's death came in the morning
 sabko aashcharya hua ki inhen patni kii mrityu kaa purvabhaas kaise ho gaya
 a story about the fiery saint of the Aghor sect is famous, that once upon a time the King of Kashi was riding on his elephant from the ashram at Shivala, he looked at Baba Kinaram in a stilted eye, immediately Baba Kinaram ordered the walk on the wall
 , That much to say, the wall went on and Kashi started walking ahead of the King's elephant
 tab kaashi naresh ko apane abhimaan kaa bodh ho gaya or tatkaal baba kinaaraam ji ke charnon main gir gayi
 These detractors used to live, even got out of the house and on their way to Kameshwar Dham, near the Cars Village in Ghazipur district, reached the service of Sivaram, the saint of Ramanuji sect

 He reached some distance away from the Gangahat with the contents of Shivram Ji's worship and stopped and bowed to Gangaji

 While wandering, Naidih reached the village
 vahaan ek vriddha bahut ro kalp rahi thi
 On being asked, he told that the zamindar's soldiers have taken his only son in return for the outstanding rent
 kinaaraam ji ne vriddha ke saath jameendaar ke dwaar par jaakar dekha ki vah ladkaa dhoop main baitha rakhaa he
 The request of the zamindar to free him went in vain, then Kinaram told the landlord - where the boy is seated, get the land dug up and take as much of your money as possible
 haath do haath gaharaai tak khudwane par vahaan ashesh ru pye pade dekhakar sab stambhit rah gaye
 The boy was immediately released, the landlord apologized very much
 budhiya ne vah ladkaa kinaaraam ji ko hi saunp diya
 Bijaram was his name and probably after renouncing Kinaram ji's body, the same was installed on the throne of his monastery in Varanasi
 aughadon ke maanya sthal girnaar par kinaaraam ji ko dattatreya ke swayan darshan hue the jo rudra ke baad aughadpan ke dwitiya pratishthapak maane jate hai
 It is believed that the Supreme Siddha Oghadars of Lord Dattatreya are seen at Girnar even today
 In the present generation, in the twelfth generation of Kinarami Ooghadpanthi Paramsiddhas, Varanasi Siddha Aghoreshwar Lord Rama also had a direct vision of Dattatreya Ji on Mount Girnar
 girnaar ke baad kinaaraam ji bijaram ke saath junagarh pahunche
 In the crime of begging there, the men of the then Nawab kept Bijaram in jail and out of the 981 mills kept there, most of whom were already running captive saints, gave them a mill to run
 kinaaraam ji ne siddhible se yah jaan liya tathaa duusare din swayan nagar main jaakar bhiksha maangane lage
 He too was imprisoned and was given a mill to run
 baba ne bina haath lagaae chakki se chalane ko kaha kintu yah to unki lila thi, chakki nahin chali
 Then they picked up a wood lying nearby and hit the mill
 aashcharya ki sab 981 chakkiyaan apane aap chalane lageen
 On receiving the news, the Nawab apologized profusely and according to Baba's orders, promised that from that day, whatever sadhus Mahatma would come to Junagadh would be given two and a half paav flour daily in Baba's name

 After many years of rigorous penance in the Uttarakhand Himalayas, Kinaram ji reached Oughdar Baba Kaluram, residing at the crematorium of Harishchandra Ghat in Varanasi
 kaluram ji bade prem se dah kiye hue shavon kii bikhri padi khopadiyon ko apane paas bula-bulaakar chane khilaate the
 Kinaram felt this futile mess and he stopped walking the skulls with his proven power
 kaluram ne dhyaan lagaakar samaj liya ki yah shakti keval kinaaraam main he
 Seeing them, Kaluram said - hungry
 machhlee khilaao
 Kinaram turned to the banks of the Ganges and said, "gangia, bring a fish
" ek badi machhlee swat: pani se baahar aa gai
 After a while Kaluram showed Kinaram a corpse flowing in the Ganges
 kinaaraam ne vahiin se murde ko pukaara, vah bahata hua kinare aa laga or uthakar khadaa ho gaya
 Baba Kinaram sent him back home, but his mother left him for Baba's footsteps

 In law, a lien or lien is a type of approval of an interest protection to secure payment in exchange for a debt refinance or discharge of any other liability in lieu of an asset
 sampatti kaa maalik, jo lian yaa grahanadhikaar pradaan karata he, ko lianor or jis vyakti ko lian kaa laabh miltaa he use liyani kaha jaataa he
 The anglo-french lien, Loyen "bond", "restrant", from the Latin ligamen, the word "to bind" from the ligare is the origin of the etymology
 sanyukt rajya america main, shabd lian aamtaur par shulk bhaar kii ek vistrut shrinkhalaa ko darshata he or isamen anya prakaar ke bandhak yaa shulk shaamil hote hai
 In the United States, lien is singularly referred to non-proprietary security interests or interest securities
 anya samaan kanoon vaale deshon main, lian shabd ek bahut hi vishesh prakaar ke byaji pratibhuti ke liye sanderbhit he; iske tahat karj yaa anya daayitv se mukt hone tak sampatti par pratidhaaran kaa niskriy adhikaar praapt hota he
 In other countries there is a purely self-interest form of securities interest; In contrast, in the USA, the term is definitely used when the property is not intrusive and then the lien is released
 haalanki, samaan kanoonvaale deshon main isaki pahchaan pratibhuti vyaaj ke jaraa asangat prakaar ke rup main bhi kii jaati he, "nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar" kehalaata he, jo kuch durlabh maamalon main saamne aata he
 Despite the differences in terminology and its implementation, there are a number of similarities between the various liens in the USA and countries with common law
 grahanadhikaar sahmatijnya yaa asahmatijnya ho sakate hai ; sahmatijnya grahanadhikaar rindaata or rini ke bich ek anubandh dwaara lagaaya jaataa he: Non-consensual lien arises exclusively by act or by proceeding with similar law
 ve kanoon rindaata tathaa rini ke bich ke sambandh ke banaaye rakhane ke dwaara rindaata ko sthavar sampada athwa chal-sampatti ke mad par grahanadhikaar adhiropit karne kaa adhikaar dete hai
 Those liens include liens "doshahin" yaa "doshapurn" bhi hote hai 
 doshahin liens wo liens hote hai jinke liye ek rindaata tisare paksh ke rindaataaon kaa sammaan karte hue rinbhargrast sampatti par ek praathamikta adhikaar sthapit karata he
 Completeness is certified by taking the steps required by law, usually by sending the lien notice to the third party
 asal baat yah he ki sampatti kii ek cheez yaa ansh rindaata ke haathon main ho to aamtaur par purnataa sthapit ho jaati he
 When the property remains in the hands of the debtor, then some action should be taken, such as recording of the notice of interest security in the appropriate office
 kisi lian kii purnataa sampatti main rindaata ke hit ko surakshit karne ke kaam kaa ek mahatvapurn hissaa he
 The flawless lien is valid for the real purchaser of the property, and even in the case of a bankrupt trustee, while the defective lien may not
 sanyukt rajya america main nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar vah adhikaar he jo keval equity par hi lagu hota he or jo bagaiyr kosh athwa sampitt par kabja kiye kisi kosh vishesh athwa kisi khaas sampatti kii maang ko puraa karata he
 In US law, such lien arises specifically under four circumstances: USA ke baahar, ek samaan kanoon grahanadhikaar ko saamaanya shabdon main kanoon dwaara pradutt chal sampatti ko roke rahane ke niskriy adhikaar ke rup main paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 Modern law usually waives a legal lien when a case is historically established without any real effort to enforce in modern circumstances
 tappenden banaam arts 2 QB 185 diplock LJ main ek "swayan seva" upaay kaa lian sanderbhit he, jaise ki "updrav kii samaapti, aatm-suraksha yaa atikaramiyon ko jameen se baahar nikaalane jaise anya puraane upaay"
 nyaaysangat liens sampatti ke adhikaar kaa ek asaamaanya prakaar hai, jinhen aamtaur par sui genaris mana jaataa he
 Special lien and general lien are divided into a common law lien
 a special lien, which is of a very common type, requires a close relationship between the property and the service rendered
 tatkaal lenden se sambandhit fees ke sambandh main keval ek vishesh lian yaa grahanadhikaar kaa hi prayog kiya ja saktaa he; saath hi puraane rinon kii pratibhuti ke rup main roak rakhi gayi sampatti kaa prayog liyani yaa rini nahin kar saktaa
 ek saamaanya grahanadhikaar rini kii un sabhi sampatti par prabhaav daalata he jo rindaata ke kabje main he or rini ko rindaata dwaara die gaye sabhi karj kii suraksha kii guarantee karata he
 a special lien can be extended to a general lien by contract and is usually done in the case of carriers
 ek samaan kanoon grahanadhikaar sirf pratidhaaran kaa ek niskriy adhikaar hi detaa he; samaan kanoon main bikri karne kaa adhikaar nahin hota he, haalanki kuch pariniyamon main bikri karne ke atirikt adhikaar bhi pradutt hote hai, or anubandh ke jariye ek alag adhikaar pradutt karnaa sambhav he
 Similar law liens closely align with so-called "common callings", but are not co-extensive
 ek samaan kanoon grahanadhikaar ek bahut hi simit prakaar kaa pratibhuti byaaj he
 a lien cannot be transferred, despite the fact that it gives only passive rights of possession; It cannot be asserted by any third party, who has the goods in possession, for services which should be done by the original party; And if the movable property is surrendered to the lender, the entitlement of the lien ceases forever
 Any debtor who illegally sells the movable property may be responsible for the conversion, as well as the surrender of the lien
 samaan kanoon vaale deshon main nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar yaa equitable liens ne anuthe or kathin muddon main vruddhi kii he
 An equitable lien is a non-possessive security right conferred by the proceeding of law, which in effect is similar to an equitable charge
 yah kisi charge se alag hota he tab yah gaiyr sahmati-janya he
 It is given in very limited circumstances, the most common of which is in relation to the sale of land; An impregnated seller has an equitable lien on the land for the purchase price, even if the purchaser has occupied the property
 This is seen as a counter-charge to the Aquitable Rule, which confers a beneficial interest on the land to the buyer after exchange of contracts for purchase
 yah anumaan kii baat he ki abhukt vikreta grahanadhikaar ke baahar nyaaysangat grahanadhikaar kaa kitna vistaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In many cases involving active things, an equitable lien has been withheld, but not yet in relation to movable property
 Australian courts are most receptive to equitable lien cases related to personal property 57 (see ALJR 211), but the lack of clarity of principles concerning who to impose an equitable lien was seen in the cases reviewed
 lekin kul milakar, abhi bhi kendriya talmail main ek kami mahasoos kii jaati he
 Although the argument as to the lien discussed may not be practicable, two other forms of debt burden are also sometimes referred to as liens
 kuch vidhiyaan dayitvon ke liye ek suraksha ke rup main uske maalik ke khilaaf sampatti ke pratidhaaran kaa niskriy adhikaar pradaan karti hai
 For example, section 88 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 of the United Kingdom allows the airport to halt an aircraft for impaired airport charges and aviation fuel
 haalanki is adhikaar ko UK diwalia kanoon ke tahat grahanadhikaar ke rup main mana jaataa he, lekin tark he is tarah ke vaidhanik adhikaar darasal grahanadhikaar nahin hai, lekin ye adhikaar grahanadhikaar ke anuroop hai; haalanki kuch log kah sakate hai ki bagaiyr kisi antar ke yah bhed he
 It is said that a contract entered into by an agreement is not a lien, in which one party can hold the other party's goods until payment is made, because the lien is not a non-consensual lien under a common law
 so may
 However, it appears that under insolvency law, such rights will be treated as lien even if they are not expressed as lien
 samudri grahanadhikaar vah grahanadhikaar he jo pot par us rindaata ke daawey ko sunishchit karne ke liye diya jaataa he jo pot par samudri sevaayen pradaan karata he athwa pot kaa upyog karne main ghayal hua ho
 samudri grahanadhikaar kabhi kabhi suchit drushti bandhak ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Maritime liens are similar in most jurisdictions under the laws of other liens
 samudri grahanadhikaar "bahut hi anokhe nausena kanoon kii vishistataaon main se ek" ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 a maritime lien creates a securities interest of this nature on ships that are unknown to the Uniform Law or Equity
 yah shuddh rup se kanoon kii kaarywahi se saamne aata he or sambandhit sampatti par ek daawey ke rup main vidyaman rahata he, gupt tathaa adrishy donon tarah se, jise aksar parinium dwaara panjikrut byaaj suraksha ke anya roopon par praathamikta di jaati he
 However these characteristics differ under the laws of different countries, which can be described as: duniya bhar main, badi sankhya main liens ke vibhinn prakaar or iske bahut saare up-vibhaajan hai
 Not all of the following liens exist in all statutory systems so that the concept of lien is recognized
 The details given below are not necessarily mutually exclusive
 Types of lien include data aisa sthaan sangrahit karne vaala poorak he jisko computer yaa mobile ke si pi you memory main sthaan diya jaataa he
 In which it remains protected
 tathaa kisi program ko shuru karne gati dene or sthagit karne ke kaary main data ek madhyam kii tarah prayog kiya jaataa he
 The first use of the word dat was in 1940 in English
 "transmicible or stalabel computer soochna" me "data" shabd kaa pehali baar 1 9 46 me upyog kiya 
 The word dat has many meanings like information, knowledge, this word is related to data, but each word has its own importance
 data keval computer se sambandhit shabd nahin he koi bhi soochna ko bhi ham data kah sakate he
 Even before computer was not invented, people used to collect data which was kept in books and is still kept today

 Shyamlal Chaturvedi is a Chhattisgarhi writer and poet, journalist

 Any disease that is caused by such a retarded immune response is called autoimmune disease
 swapratiraksha akasar lakshyit pind main jeevanapadaarth ke vikaas ko abhaav ke kaaran hoti he or is tarah pratirakshi pratikriya uski apni koshikaon or utakon ke viruddh kaary karti he 
 iske ullekhneey udaahranon main shaamil hai, celia rog, madhumeh prakaar 1 ), pranalik lupas arithematosus ), jograine kaa rogesamooh, churg-strans rogesamooh, hashimoto kaa avatushoth, grevz rog, ideopathic thrombocytopinic parpura or gathiyaroop sandhishoth )
 dekhen, swatahpratirakshak rogon kii suchi
 The misconception that a person's immune system is completely incapable of identifying its own antigens is not new
 beesvin sadi ke prarambh main paul ehralich ne horer autotoxicus kaa siddhant prastut kiya, jiske anusaar ‘saamaanya’ sharir apane swayan ke utakon ke viruddh pratirakshi pratikriya shuru nahin karata he
 In this way, any autoimmune response was considered abnormal and related to human disease
 ab yah sweekaar kar liya gaya he ki swapratirakshi pratikriyaayein prishthvanshi pratirakshak pranaaliyon kaa ek atoot hissaa hoti hai, jinhen saamanytah rog utpann karne se swatah-pratijanon ke prati pratirakshatmak sahishnutaa kii kriya dwaara roka jaataa he
 Self-defense should never be considered as separate immunity
 swapratiraksha kaa ucch str jahaan aswasthkar hota he, vahiin iskaa kam str vastav main laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 First, low-level autoimmunity helps identify the cells produced by CD8 + t cells and thus reduces the incidence of cancer
 duusare, swapratiraksha kii sankraman kii praarambhik avasthaaon main tej pratirakshi pratikriya hone dene main bhoomika ho sakati he, jis samay videshi pratijanon kii uplabdhi pratikriya ko simit karti he

 In this way Stefanova maintains the reactivity of CD4 + t cells in the absence of other foreign antigens

 This breakdown causes the immune system to initiate an effective and specific immune response against the adjuvant
 pratirakshi sahishnutaa kii sahi utpatti abhi tak gyaat nahin he, lekin iske mul kaa varnan karne ke liye madhya-beesvin sadi se kai siddant prastut kiye gaye hai
 Three hypotheses have caught the attention of immunologists extensively: inke alaava do anya siddanton kaa gahan adhyayan jari he: Tolerance can also be divided into 'central' and 'periodic' tolerances, depending on whether or not the above methods of testing work in the central lymphoid components or periodic lymphoid components
 is baat par jor dena chaiye ki ye siddant paraspar anany nahin hai or is baat ke adhikadhik sanket mil rahe hai ki ye sabhi prakriyaayein prishthvanshi pratirakshak sahishnutaa main sakriy rup se bhaag le sakati hai
 Loss of tolerance is a confounding feature in voluntary human autoimmunity, which is almost entirely limited to autoantibody responses produced by B
 lymphocytes
 tii koshikaon main sahishnutaa ke lop ko darshana atyant hi kathin he or jahaan kahin bhi asaamaanya tii koshika pratikriya kaa saboot uplabdh he, vah saamanyatya swapratipindon dwaara pahachaane gaye pratijanon ke prati nahin hoti he
 In this way, autoantibodies to igg Fc are found in bovine vata, but there does not appear to be a corresponding t cell response
 Systemic lupus has autoantibodies to DNA, which cannot induce t cell responses, and limited evidence of t cells responses to nucleoprotein antigens is found guilty
 celia rog main utak transglutaminez ke prati swapratipind hote hai, lekin tii koshika pratikriya videshi pratijan glayadin ke prati hoti he
 This disparity has led to the idea that human autoimmune disease is in most cases based on the omission of b cell tolerance, which uses normal t cell responses against foreign antigens in a variety of misguided ways
 kuch logon main swapratirakshi rog hone kii jananik rup se atisamvedansheeltaa hoti he
 This hypersensitivity is associated with many genes and other risk factors
 jananik rup se samvedansheel logon main swapratirakshi rog sadaiv hi viksit nahin hote hai
 Three main sets of genes are suspected in many autoimmune diseases
 ye jine nimna se sambandhit hai: The first two, which participate in the recognition of antigens, are innately variable and susceptible to recombination
 ye parivartan pratirakshi tantra ko atyant vividh prakaar ke aakraamakon ke prati pratikriya karne kii kshamta pradaan karte hai, kintu saath hi swa-pratikriya karne kii kshamta vaali lasikakoshikaayen bhi utpann kar sakate hai

 iske baad hard court yues open kaa aayojan hota he
 For the men, the Grass Court Egon Championships are held in London and the Gray Weber Open is held in Halle, Germany, both of which serve as important promotional events

 In the spring of 1877, the club was renamed 'the All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club' and signaled its name change by organizing the first lawn tennis competition

 However, in 1980 four new courts were built in the northern part of the grounds, now the center court could be more correctly defined
 1997 main nae pehle number ke court ke udghaatan se is vivaran ko bal mila

 In the championship games, ball boys and girls, known as BBG, play an important role in the tournament, in short it can be said that a good BBG "should not appear
 They should do their job silently in the background"

 Earlier, from the 1920s onwards, ball boys were supplied by Shaftsbury Children's Home

 Due to the influence of his Tattad qualities, horse, cow, village and rathadi remain in his control
 is prakaar vah nikhil vishwa kaa pratinidhi he
 Even the deity deserves his grace
 indra ne asthir prithvi ko sthery pradaan kiya he
 Indra has installed them on the plank by piercing the wings of the mountains flying here and there
 usne dyu-lok ko bhi stabdh kiya or is prakaar antariksh kaa nirmaan kiya
 In the middle of two clouds is the electric fire or in the middle of two stone blocks is the father of normal fire
 indra ko surya or hawa ushaa kaa udbhaavak bhi kaha gaya he
 He is the motivator of space or surface waters
 isiilie use varsha kaa devtaa maanate hai
 There is no one apart from Indra who is not only the earth, but also the one who stabilizes the whole world
 isse ‘usne sabhi padaarthon ko gatiman banaaya’ yah arth grahan karne par bhi indra kaa mahatmaya nahin ghatata
 Indra discovered the monster named 'shambar' hidden in the dreaded mountains in the 40th year and killed it
 bal-pradarshan karne vaale ‘ahi’ naamak daanav kaa bhi usne sanhaar kiya
 By killing the said ‘ahi’, Indra made seven rivers such as the dedicating waters or the Ganges flow
 hinsaarth swarg main chadhate hue rohin asur ko bhi indra ne apane vajra se maar daalaa
 a monster called Bal had kept innumerable cows in his enclosure
 un gaayon kii lokkalyanarth balpurvak baahar nikaalane kaa shrey indra ko hi he
 Some scholars destroy the polar cosmic darkness by Indra in the sun form or destroy the extreme cold that accumulates on the waters, or the release of water from the non-ferocious clouds, by the worship of non-destruction, chitra-slaughter, shambar-slaughter and force-killing
 We imagine the release of the sun-like cows covered with clouds, which do not seem far from the truth
 ‘yah sompa’ kah kar rishi ne indra kii durvyasan-parata kii ore bhi ingit kiya he
 'som' is Indra's favorite drink
 uske baraabar koi anya devtaa som-paan nahin kar saktaa
 'som' gives him strength and vigor for wars
 som-sevi hone ke kaaran indra ko ve log parampriy hai, jo som kaa abhishav karte hai athwa pakaa kar use siddh karte hai
 He protects such people
 itnaa hi nahin, aise priy vyaktiyon ko vah dhan-vaibhav se puraskrit bhi karata he
 The second thing is that she is found to be soma, slays her apostles with her armament thunderbolt, is downgrader to shudras or hell to her apostles, yet she is utterly revered because of her other virtues
 dyavapruthivi ke praani use sadaa naman karte hai
 People pray to him that 'O Indra! We should always be ready in your prayers, having a beautiful son and grandson and have become your beloved
 ’ It is thus clear that Indra occupies the paramount and best position among the Vedic deities
 indra kii charitavali main vrutravadh kaa bada mahatva he
 In the Rigveda, the name of Indra also comes in seven Dev-pairs
 aise yugmon main 11 sookt indra-agni ke liye hai, 9 sookt indra-varun ke liye, 7 indra-vaayu ke liye, 2 indra-som, 2 indra-brihaspati, 1 indra-vishnu or 1 sookt indra-pushan ke liye hai
 Indra has similarities with all of them and there are differences
 udhaaharan ke liye indra or varun ke yugma ko liya ja saktaa he
 Although Varuna is described in very few verses, he is considered the most important after Indra
 9 sookhton main indra or varun kaa sanyukt varnan he
 The two have many similarities
 kaha gaya he ki jagat ke adhipati indravarun ne saritaaon ke path khode or surya ko dhuloak main gatiman banaaya
 They beat the circle
 yuddh main sahaayak hai
 Conquers worshipers
 krurkarma pamaron par apana amogh vajra phenkate hai
 Despite these similarities, both also have many contrasts: - upanishdon main swaabhaavik vishayanusaar yada-kada indra ko bhi gyaan-prapti hetu utsuk dikhaaya gaya he
 One such story is being given from the Chandyopopanishad: - Prajapati had said that whoever knows a soul devoid of sinless, noxious, death-mourning, etc
, attains the whole world and all desires
 prajapati kii ukti sunakar devtaa tathaa asur donon hi us aatma ko jaanane ke liye utsuk ho uthe, at: devataaon ke raja indra tathaa asuron ke raja virochan paraspar irshyaabhaav ke saath haathon main samidhaayen lekar prajapati ke paas pahunche
 Both practiced celibacy for thirty-two years, then Prajapati asked for the purpose of his arrival
 unki jigyaasa jaanakar prajapati ne unhen sundar vastralankaran se yukt hokar jal se aapurit sakore main swayan ko dekhne ke liye kaha or bataaya ki vahi aatma he
 Seeing their reflection in both the Sakras, they walked away satisfied
 prajapati ne sochaa ki dev hon yaa asur, aatma kaa saakshaatkaar kiye bina uskaa paraabhav hoga
 Virochan reached out to the asuras with a satisfied mind and told them that the soul is worshipable
 uski paricharya karke manushya donon lok praapt kar letaa he
 Before reaching the deities, Indra thought that wearing a jewelery in Sakore shows a fitted form, a fragmented body of a fragmented body, a blind form of the blind, then how did this azar-immortal soul become? He again reached Prajapati
 prajapati ne indra ko pun: battis varsh apane paas rakhaa taduparant bataaya-'jo swapn main poojit hota hua vichrata he, vahi aatma, amrit, abhaya tathaa brahm hai
 Indra again appeared in Prajapati's service with doubt
 is prakaar teen baar battis-battis varsh tak tathaa ek baar paanch varsh tak indra ko brahmacharyavas main rakhkar prajapati ne unhen aatma ke swaroop kaa purna gyaan kuch is tarah karavaaya :- Indra does not have a place in the mythological deity that is in the Vedic pantheon
 puranic devmandal main trimurti-brahma, vishnu or shiv kaa mahatv bad jaataa he
 Indra is still considered as Devadhiraja
 vah dev-lok kii rajdhani amravati main rahata he
 Here Nandan is forest, Parijat and Kalpavriksha
 sudharma uski rajsabha tathaa sahasr mantriyon kaa uskaa mantrimandal he
 Shachi or Indrani is wife, Airavat elephant and Astra Vajra or Ashani
 inke ghode kaa naam ucchanshrava he
 Whenever a human wants to get Indrapad by his penance, the throne of Indra gets in trouble
 apane singhaasana kii raksha ke liye indra praaia: tapasviyon ko apsaraon se mohit kar pathbhrasht karata hua paaya jaataa he
 Many stories of this relationship are found in the Puranas
 puranic indra shaktimaan, samrudh or vilaasi raja ke rup main chitrit he
 Despite having many powers and being a valid king, sometimes he has been shown to be unrestrained and tearful, due to which he has also been declining
 durvasa ke shaap se patan kii ek katha aage di ja rahi he
 Once, Durvasa Rishi blessed Indra with a garland of childlike flowers received from Vidyadhari
 indra ko aishwarya kaa itnaa mad tha ki unhone vah pushp apane hathi ke mastak par rakh diya
 Due to the effect of the flower, the elephant got attracted by its fragrance and sniffed it and threw it on the earth
 indra use sanbhaalane main asamarth rahe
 Durvasa cursed him to be Shrihin
 amravati bhi atyant bhrasht ho chali
 Indra first reached Jupiter's and then Brahma's refuge
 samast devtaa vishnu ke paas gayi
 He commanded Lakshmi to be the ocean-daughter
 at: lakshmi sagar main chali gayi
 Vishnu, describing the various situations of abandonment of Lakshmi, ordered him to churn the ocean
 manthan se jo anek ratna nikle, unamem lakshmi bhi thi
 Lakshmi pleased Narayana by giving her a garland
 lakshmi ne devon ko trilok se ab virahit nahin hone kaa vardaan diya
 The king of the gods was called Indra
 valmikiy ramayana main varnit he ki meghagiri naamak parvat par devataaon ne harith rang ke ashv vaale paakshasan indra ko raja ke pad par abhishikt kiya tha
 In the Ramayana, he is considered the god of rain
 gautam ke shaap ke parinamswaroop unhen meshavrushan bhi kaha gaya he
 In the Ramayana, he is depicted as a tough ruler, great warrior, Vishwavandya Lokpal and sympathetic deity as well as luxuriant, jealous and conspirator
 inhone trishanku ko swarg main pahunchaa dekhakar use vahaan se ulta gira diya
 He kidnapped the sacrificial fire of Ambareesh
 ambarish ne jab richik ke manjhale putr shunagashep ko yajna-pashu banaaya to shunagashep kii stuti se prasann hokar inhone use bachaaya tathaa dderghaayu banaaya
 Respect for them and a sense of protection from the crisis remains in the public
 van-yatra main ram kii raksha ke liye kausalya indra kaa bhi aahvaan karti he
 His conspiratorial form also appears in Ramayana
 ek satyawadee or pavitra tapasvi kii tapasya main vighn daalane ke liye inhone apana uttam khadg dharohar ke rup main use de diya tha
 Vedic Indra was not afraid
 ramayana main indra bhi ravan ke bhay se kaanp uthte the
 Indra became peacock after seeing Ravana present at the time of the sacrifice of Marutha
 haalaanki inaki veerta asandigdh rahi he
 For his marriage to Shachi, he killed Puli, Shachi's father, and Anhulad who defeated Shachi by deceit
 ravan ke swarg par akraman ke samay devsena ko vinasht hote dekhakar inhone bina kisi ghabrahat ke ravan kaa saamana kar use yuddh se vimukh kar diya tha
 Meghnad was able to arrest them with the help of Maya
 ram-ravan yuddh dekhakar dev-gandharv-kinnaron ne kaha ki yah yuddh samaan nahin he kyonki ravan ke paas to rath he or ram paidal hai
 So Indra sent his chariot to Ram, which also had Indra's armor, huge bow, arrow and power
 vineet bhav se haath jodakar matli ne ramchandra se kaha ki ve rathadi vastuon ko grahan karen or jaise mahan indra daanvon kaa sanhaar karte hai, usee tarah ravan kaa vadh karen
 After the end of the war, Rama ordered Matali to return Indra's chariot
 indra ke prasang main kuch log ahalya kii puranic katha ko managasaint vaidic sandarbh dekar uski manamaani vyakhya karke apni vidwata kaa anarthak pradarshan karte hai
 By the way, in the name of the Vedic context, Ahalya means 'land without plowing'
 is sandarbh main anivarytah dhyatavya pehali baat yah he ki rugveda main 'ahalya' yaa 'ahilya' shabd kaa prayog hua hi nahin he
 Not only the Rigveda, other Vedic Samhita texts also do not have this word
 brahman granthon main iskaa ullekh maatr he
 In the Shatapatha Brahmin, the word 'ahalyai Jar' is used for Indra
 spashtatah yah prayog usee katha kii ore sanket karata he jiskaa varnan valmikiy ramayana aadi granthon main he
 Secondly, the word 'plow' is also not used in the Rigveda
 krishikarya main prayukt hal ke liye rugveda main 'langal' shabd kaa prayog hua he
 The second word used for the plow is 'sira', in other Samhita texts and Brahmins, 'plow' is not used
 vastutah hal kaa prayog vedangon ke samay main sambhavtah aarambh hua hoga or loukik sanskrit main hi iskaa adhik prayog hua he
 In such a situation, the aforesaid interpretation of Ahalya is at least different or far from Vedic references
 rahi pratikatmak vyakhya kii baat to vah to anekanek puranic kathaon ke liye sambhav he or aise praytn hote bhi rahe hai
 But by concocting the legend of Indra and Ahalya by concocting Vedic scriptures to prove the divinity of Rama as the imagery of the poets of Ramkatha, it is really a matter of revealing their factual disloyalty to Rama and God, which is really a matter of personal recognition; It is totally unsuitable for any knowledge material
 valmikiy ramayana main indra-ahalya prasang kii katha di gayi he
 Indra had abducted Gautama's wife Ahalya
 kahani is prakaar he- shacheepati indra ne ashram se gautam kii anupasthiti jaanakar or muni kaa vesh dhaaran kar ahalya se kaha
 
 17
 
 he ati sundari! kamijan bhogavilas ke liye ritukal kii pratiksha nahin karte, arthath yah baat nahin maanate ki jab stri masik dharm se nivruth hon keval tabhi unke saath samagam karnaa chahie
 Therefore, o beautiful waistcoat! i want to meet with you 
 18
 
 Vishwamitra says that o Raghunandan! Even after recognizing Indra, the idol Munevikadhari, with the idea that 'devraj Indra himself wants me', agreed to this proposal
 
 19
 
 After that, he was satisfied and said to God, the best among the gods, o Surottam! i was grateful ab aap yahaan se sheeghra chale jaaiye
 
 20
 
 tab indra ne bhi hanste hue kaha ki he sundar nitambon vaali! main purna santusht hum
 Now i will go from where i came
 is prakaar ahalya ke saath sangam kar vah kutiyaa se niklaa
 This episode is described in a very human form in the Valmiki Ramayana
 yahan ahalya ke pathar yaa nadi hone kaa ullekh bhi nahin he
 It has been said in the curse that she will remain hidden most of the time
 vaayu pikar hi arthath upwas karti hui rahegi or ram ke aane par unka aatithy-satkar karne par purv rup main aa jaaegi
 It is also written clearly about the end of the curse that it was difficult for anyone to see Ram before seeing him, after seeing Ram, he started seeing everyone
 isse puri tarah spasht he ki shila yaa nadi hone kii kalpana valmikiy ramayana se bahut baad kii he
 In order to establish the superiority of the trinity and the importance of Indra was continuously reduced, all the blame was put on Indra itself and the character of Ahalya was considered holy
 katipay vidwaanon ne is katha ko pratikatmak arth dene kaa praytn kiya he
 The use of mystic terminology in religious texts has been in vogue since ancient times and Vedic terminology used to be icing on gold, so the above statement can also be symbolic
 vishleshan karne par bhinn-bhinn arth saamne aate hai:- In temporal Sanskrit, Ahalya means "without plow" meaning barren land
 jaisaa ki gyaat hi he indra duusare deshon par akraman karata tha to parinaam swaroop hari-bhari bhoomi banjar ho jaati thi indra, is bhojan ke strot yaa jangal ke strot jisase fal, kand-mul aadi milte the unhen nasht kar ke apane dushmano ko nuksaan pahunchaata tha
 Later, when Vishwamitra told Rama that it is Ahalya, he may mean that it is "without plow" i
e
 wasteland, make it fertile and Rama has made that land fertile again
 doosraa prasang 'nadi' ke sandarbh main 'brahmpurana " or "anand ramayana " ke anusaar ho saktaa he
 The word 'sira' in Apabhramsa has two meanings, one is stone and the other is dry river
 jaisaa krishi ke rup main vishleshan kiya gaya he usee tarah yah bhi ho saktaa he ki vastut: koi nadi hogi jo indra ke dushman desh main jaati hogi or uske mukhya pani ke strot ko indra ne sukha diya hoga taaki dushman desh ko pani na mil sake or baad main ram ne ise jalayukt banaaya hoga
 In this way, Ahalya-incident is just humanization of nature
 mahabharat main indra kaa puranic swaroop hi miltaa he
 Here the pride described in Vedic literature is no more
 inhen visheshtah 'shakr' naam se sambodhit kiya gaya he
 The fear of losing his Devaraj position makes him persecute and he tries his best to avoid it
 vishwamitra ke tap se bhaybheet hokar menka naamak apsara ko unka tap bhang karne bheja
 Fearing the tenacity of Shardwat, Apsara named Janapadi sent her to dissolve her tenacity
 yavakrit ke tap se bhaybheet hokar indra ne ek brahman kaa rup dhaaran kar unhen tap se virat kiya
 The mention of the Ahalya-passage mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana is also found in the Mahabharata
 yahan use balaat-kaary mana gaya he
 In the Mahabharata, the narrative support of Indra being 'harishmashru' mentioned in the Rigveda is also found
 yahan kaha gaya he ki gautam ke shaap ke kaaran hi indra ko harishmashru hona padaa
 He was the father of Arjuna
 vritrasur ke bhay se sabhi devataaon ne apni shaktiyaan inhen samarpit kar di thi
 Therefore Arjuna was asked to get the divya from him
 inase sambandhit anek kahaniyaan mahabharat main di gayi hai
 Indra is literally the name of a post
 devataaon ke raja ke pad ko 'indra' kehete hai
 The name of the person sitting on that post also becomes Indra
 iske sanket to anek puranic kathaon evam vivaranon main miltaa he, parantu mahabharat ke anek sandarbhon se yah bhaleebhanti spasht ho jaataa he ki yah ek pad kaa naam he
 The stories in which these positions are afraid of being snuffed out become clear when looking at the stories of other persons to become Indra with those stories
 anek jagah 'indra' shabd kaa vyaktivachi prayog na hokar padvachi prayog hua he
 Some reference sightings are: - shiv ne indra ko moorchhit kar purvakaal ke anya chaar indron ke saath ek gupha main daal diya
 Narakasura, who aspires for Indrapad, was killed by Vishnu
 shakr ke netritv main rishiyon, devataaon ne skanda se devon kaa 'indra' banane ke liye kaha
 Nahush became 'indra' when he left the Indra post of Shakra, after suffering from Brahmana
 baad main nahush kaa patan hone par vishnu ke aadeshaanusaar ashwamedh yajna kaa anushthan karke shakr ne punah indra-pad praapt kiya
 Apart from these, many explicit references to the post of Indra are available in Mahabharata
 vishnupurana main tritiy ansh ke pratham evam dwitiya adhyay main tathaa bhagwat mahapurana ke ashtum skandh ke pratham evam trayodash adhyay main 14 manvantaron ke alag-alag indron ke naam diye gayi hai
 The eighteenth treaty of Mahakavi Swayambhu's famous 'paum Chariu' epic tells the story of a man who was inspired by Devaraj Indra and wanted to do everything with his name
 rathnoopur nagar ke vidyadhar raja sahasraar kii sunitambini pinpayodhara patni kaa naam tha maanas sundari
 The son he got from Surshri was named Indra
 indra jab raja bana to sahaayak vidyadharon main se mantri kaa naam rakhaa brihaspati, hathi airavat, isi prakaar pawan, kuber, varun, yama or chandra tathaa apni gayikaon ke naam urvashi, rambha, tilottama aadi rakhkar ghoshit kiya ki indra ke jo-jo chihn hai ve mere bhi hai
 i am the Lord of the Earth
 uski samruddhi kii baat sunakar lanka ke shaasha rakshas maali ne apane bhai sumali tathaa vishaal sena ke saath akraman kiya
 After the pitched battle, Rakshasaraja was killed and Sumali entered Patal Lanka
 indra kuch samay ke liye indravat shashan karne laga
 This story is completely different from the Sanskrit tradition, like many other stories of Paum Chariu
 valmikiy ramayana main is vidyadhar indra kaa ullekh to nahin hi he, maali ke vadh ke bare main bhi spasht likhaa he ki rakshason dwaara swarglok par akraman ke samay dwandv yuddh main vishnu ne sudarshan chakra se uskaa vadh kar daalaa
 According to the Bogajkoi inscription, Indra is also mentioned among the gods of the Mittni caste along with Varuna, Mitra and Nasatya
 irani dharm main indra kaa sthaan he, parantu devataroop main nahin, daanavaroop main
 Varethraghna is the god of victory there, which is actually a version of 'vritraghna'
 isi kaaran da
kith indra ko bharat-parsik ekta ke yug se sambaddh maanate hai

 All in all, government persistence in focusing on Pakistan as the primary problem for Indian Muslims in achieving minority rights, as well as Muslim persistence in maintaining steady progress, has sometimes created extreme support for Indian nationalism , Giving a much needed credibility to the Indian state to project a strong secular image around the world

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga hindu dharm ek dharm he jiske anuyaayi adhikanshtah bharat ,nepal or morishas main bahumat main hai
 It is called the oldest religion in the world
 ise 'vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm' bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he ki isaki utpatti maanav kii utpatti se bhi pehle se he
 Scholars consider Hinduism to be a blend of different cultures and traditions of India, which has no founder
 yah dharm apane andar kai alag-alag upasna paddatiyaan, mat, sampradaay or darshan samete hue hai
 It is the third largest religion in the world based on the number of followers
 sankhya ke aadhaar par iske adhiktar upaask bharat main hai or pratishat ke aadhaar par nepal main hai
 Although many deities are worshiped in it, it is in fact a monotheistic religion
 ise sanathan dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kehete hai
 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"
 hindu keval ek dharm yaa sampradaay hi nahin he apitu jivan jeene kii ek paddati he
 Sanatana Dharma is one of the oldest religions on Earth; However, many scholars have many opinions about its history
 aadhunik itihaaskaar hadappa, mehrgarh aadi puratathvik anveshanon ke aadhaar par is dharm kaa itihaas kuch hazaar varsh purana maanate hai
 Where many signs of Hinduism are found in Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, bhagwaan shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, shivlinga, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts
 hindu manyata ke anusaar veda, upanishad aadi granth anadi, nity hai, ishwar kii krupa se alag-alag mantradrashtaa rishiyon ko alag-alag granthon kaa gyaan praapt hua jinhone phir unhen lipibaddh kiya
 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion
 naye devtaa or naye darshan ubhare
 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he
 Therefore, Sapta Sindhu converted to Aventan language and converted to Hinduism
 iske baad iraniyon ne sindhu nadi ke purv main rahane waalon ko hindu naam diya
 When Muslim invaders from Arabia came to India, they started calling the original religious people of India as Hindus
 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"
 iske antargat kai mat or sampradaay aate hai or sabhi ko baraabar shraddha di jaati he
 The scriptures are also many
 fir bhi, wo mukhya siddhanth, jo zyaadaatar hindu maanate hai, in sab main vishwaas: dharm, karm, punarjanm kaa sansaarik chakra, moksh or beshak, ishwar
 Hinduism considers heaven and hell to be temporary
 hindu dharm ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi praaniyon main aatma hoti he
 Man is the only creature who can enjoy both sin and virtue in this world and can attain salvation
 hindu dharm main chaar mukhya sampradaay hai : vaishnav, shaiva, shakt or smart 
 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect
 prachinkaal or madhyakaal main shaiva, shakt or vaishnav aapas main ladate rahete the
 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent
 sankshep main, hindutv ke pramukh tatva nimnlikhit hai-hindu-dharm hindu-koun?-- goshu bhakthirbhavedyasya pranave c drudha matih
 Reincarnation Belief: True Hinduism
 
 That is, one who has devotion in Gomata, who has a worshiping mantra, who believes in rebirth - he is a Hindu
 merutantra 33 prakaran ke anusaar ' hinan doodhyati sa hindu ' arthath jo hin ko dooshit samajhataa he vah hindu he
 According to Lokmanya Tilak- Asindho: Sindhuparyanta Yesya Bharatbhumika
 pitrubhuh punyabhushchaev sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath- sindhu nadi ke udgam-sthaan se lekar sindhu tak sampoorn bharat bhoomi jisaki pitrubhu tathaa punyabhu he, vah hindu kehalaata he
 The word Hindu is originally Pharsi, it means those Indians who are native and native of the boundary of Bharatvarsha described in the ancient texts of India, Vedas, Puranas
 kalika puraana, medni kosh aadi ke aadhaar par vartmaan hindu laa ke moolbhoot aadhaaron ke anusaar vedpratipaadit varnashram reeti se vaidic dharm main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu he
 Although some people consider the mixed form of many cultures to be Indian culture, whereas it is not
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
