 On 6 April 2009, the National Prosecuting Authority, in light of the new revelation of serious flaws in the prosecution, withdrew all charges against Zuma and co-accused French arms company Thint

 The withdrawal of the charge was announced by the acting president of the NPA, Mokothedi Empshe, who insisted that the withdrawal of the charges was due to abuses that made the legal process "tainted" and not equal to acquittal
 NPA kii ghoshnaa ke turant baad, haalanki, kam se kam do raajnneetik dalon ne suchit kiya ki aaropon ko waapas liye jane kii sthiti main ve apane se kanoonee karrwai par vichaar karenge
 The Democratic Alliance later filed an appeal for a judicial review of the npa's decision, with reference to his party leader Helen Zilla clarifying that Ampshey "did not make decisions based on the law, but was bound by political pressure" 
 On 9 June 2009, the day of hearing of the case was fixed
 jabaki zuma ne apni pratikriya ko kalochit rup se daayar kiya, ampshe ne maamle kii sunwaayee main deree kii, jisamen unhone NPA kii pratikriya ko pesh karne ke liye do vistaaran kaa anurodh kiya
 NPA spokesman Muthunzi Mahaga said they would not file papers because there are "outstanding cases" that are yet to be resolved
 democratic elliance party pramukh jile ne tark diya ki zuma kii pratikriya moulik rup se galat he or "unamem koi sanvaidhanik aadhaar nahin hai"
 jabaki kanoonee chunautiyaan jari rahi, june 2009 ko hue ek surveykshan se pataa chalaa ki, aadhe se zyada dakshin africa yah maanate hai ki raashtrapati jacob zuma acha kaam kar rahe hai
 The poll conducted by TNS Research Studies in late June 2009 showed that Zuma's approval level had steadily improved
 surveykshan main shaamil logon main se lagbhag 57% ne kaha ki ve sochate hai ki zuma ek sakasham netaa hai - yah taadaad april 2009 main raashtrapati ke naam udghaatan ke mukaable 3% tak adhik thi
 In November 2008, just a few months after former President Thabo Mbeki was withdrawn and Zuma faced corruption charges, only 36% of South Africans were positive about him
 disambar 2005 main, zuma par apane forest toun, johanesburg vaale ghar main ek 31 varshiya mahila kaa balaatkaar karne kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 The alleged victim belonged to an important ANC family, was the daughter of a close associate of Zuma's struggle days and was an AIDS activist believed to be HIV positive
 zuma ne in aaropon kaa khandan kiya or daawa kiya ki yah yon sambandh aapasi sahmati se bana tha
 Even before the charges were filed, as rumors about rape allegations erupted in November, Zuma's political prospects seemed to be on the decline
 unke ucch str ke adhikansh raajnneetik samarthakon ne in nae aaropon ke sandarbh main us tarah se pratikriya nahin di jis tarah se unhone bhrashtachar ke aaropon ke khilaaf di thi
 In a hearing before the rape trial, crowds of thousands of his supporters gathered before the court, while small anti-rape groups demonstrated for the alleged rape victim
 jaise kii zuma ne mukademe ke dauraan kiya, ve bheed ke saath lethu masini vami gaate rahe or ANC yuva lig or balm panthi party yuva lig ke pravaktaa ne zuma ke samarthan main baat kii
 As the rape trial progressed, reports surfaced that the South African left wing contingent differed on how to address Zuma's case and the sacp's relationship with him
 Many members of the party's youth wing supported Zuma while other members of the SACP were skeptical about the value of performing for a particular person against important principles of governance
 kuch purv samarthakon ke dalbadal lene ke baavjood, kai zuma samarthakon ne adaalat ke baahar pradarshan karnaa jari rakhaa, abhiyokta kii akhandta or naitikta par nirantar pratighaat karne, abhiyokta ke ek kareebi dost par apshabd oochhaalane or abhiyokta samaj kar kisi anya mahila par pathar phenkane jaise krityon ne balaatkaar virdohi samoohon kii aalochana ko badhaava diya
 Zuma's defense team presented evidence relating to the victim's sexual past and insisted that the physical relationship was with both consent
 abhiyojan paksh ne is baat par jor diya ki us mahila kaa pratirodh naa karnaa uske sadame kii sthiti main hone ke kaaran tha or un donon ke bich kaa sambandh pita putree ke sambandh jaisaa tha
 The lawsuit also sparked a political controversy when Zuma, who at the time was heading the National AIDS Council, admitted that he had unprotected sexual intercourse with a woman accused of rape, knowing that Also that she was HIV positive
 unhone adaalat main yah kaha ki "HIV sankraman ke khatre ko kam karne ke liye" uske turant baad unhone snaan kar liya
 The statement was condemned by the judge, health experts and AIDS activists
 dakshin africa kii lokapriy comic strip, madam or eve or jane maane raajnneetik cartoonist zapiro ne is maamle kaa mazaaq udaaya
 HIV kii shiksha dene waalon ne jor diya ki yah HIV sankraman ko rokane ke liye kuch nahin kar paayegaa
 On 8 May 2006, the court found Zuma innocent and Zuma agreed that the sexual act surrounded by the questions was consensual
 nyaayadhish vine dar marave ne abhiyokta ko adaalat main jhooth bolne ke liye buree tarah se fatkaaraa, lekin zuma ko bhi apni laaparvaahee ke liye doshi tehraaya
 When his rape case ended, many South Africans wondered how to fill the gaps created by Zuma's trial in his political system
 An analysis by Mel & Guardian described these incidents as particularly disturbing: phir bhi, balaatkaar mukademe ke khatm ho jane ke baad, bijness de kii krima brown ne di gargian ko bataaya "jacob zuma waapas aa gaye hai
 This poses a serious dilemma for the ANC leadership
 ab zuma waapas luthuli house kii ore agrasar hai
 ] They will demand to be reinstated back to the post of vice president and others will find it difficult to block their way 


 This is a major victory for Zuma's political career
 " The prospect of Zuma's return as a contender for the presidency became a cause for concern for international investors
 ek swatantra vishleshak ne suzav diya, "haalia surveykshanon ke anusaar, zuma or unke mashin gan chalaanevaale kafile ko union building kii ore badate hue dekhnaa mukhyatah madhyam varg or vyapaariyon ko hatotsahit karne vaala he

 The support of these organizations remained even when Zuma was facing allegations of corruption

 Zuma's dismissal was interpreted in two ways
 kai antarrashtriya paryvekshakon ne iskaa swaagat ek spasht sanket ke rup main kiya ki dakshin africa sarkaar apane bhitari rankon se bhrashtachar ko ukhaad fankne ke liye samarpit he
 On the other hand, some people in South Africa highlighted the fact that Zuma and Mbeki represent two different constituencies in the African National Congress
 kuch vampanthi samarthakon ne daawa kiya ki mabek or unka bazaar-unmukhi paksh ANC main apana varchasv kaayam rakhane ke uddheshy se zuma ko baahar nikalne kii sajeesh kar rahaa hai
 In 2005, each of Zuma's court appearances related to corruption was crowded by a large number of his supporters

 On the next court date in November, thousands of Zuma supporters gathered to support him; Zuma addressed the Durban crowd in the Zulu language and appealed to them to maintain the unity of the party and sang the song Lethu Machines Vami of the apartheid struggle, which literally translates to the words "meri machine me la" It is understood in the context of machine guns
 oktober main ANC yuva lig ke liye ek daure main desh main kisi anya jagah zuma ne ek badi bheed kii vaahvahee jiti
 While at least a partial of his political power is based on inter-party relations, one analyst argued that the loyalty of his supporters was rooted in the Zulu approach to loyalty and mutual aid

 In November 2005, a panel of assembled analysts agreed that it would be difficult for any other possible ANC candidate to defeat Zuma in the country's presidential race in 2009, if Zuma is found innocent on corruption charges

 However, the Balm section of the party and additional party organizations such as the ANC Youth League, South African Balm Panthi Party and South African Trade Union Congress have advocated a strong stand on Zimbabwe
 
 yahi sanghathan hai jinase zuma apane liye samarthan jutate hai
 Zuma's stance on Zimbabwe was mixed
 2006 main german patrika der spigel ko die ek saakshaatkaar main, unhone mugabe ke prati bhaavnaatmak sahanubhuti vyakt karte hue kaha ki "europea aksar is tathy kii andekhi karte hai ki mugabe africaiyon ke bich bahut lokapriy hai
 In his eyes, he got the blacks back to their country after centuries of colonialism
 "he added that" people love them, so how can we condemn them? Many in Africa believe that there is a racist aspect in the criticism of Mugabe by Europeans and Americans
 angola, congou ganraajya or rwanda main lakhon ashwet maare gaye
 Western countries have already become dissatisfied due to the unfortunate death of some Europeans in Zimbabwe
 " However, until December 2007, he was more forthright in criticizing the leadership of Zimbabwe, under which he defined his policies in more contrast with Mbeki's policies: yah or bhi dukhad he ki anya vishwa ke anya netaaon jinhonen daman dekha he yah bahaanaa karte hai ki aisa kabhi hua hi nahin, yaa yah atishyoktipurna he
 When history finally discusses the dictators, then those who stand by the side and see the spectacle should also bear the consequences
 a shameful quality of the modern world is to look back on injustice and ignore the difficulties of others

 ) According to mythology, there was a king named Sudhanwa in ancient times
 ve ek din akhet ke liye van gayi
 It was only after he left that his wife became menstruated
 usne is samachar ko apni shikari pakshi ke madhyam se raja ke paas bhijwaya
 After receiving the news, Maharaj Sudhanwa took out his semen in one and gave it to the bird
 pakshi us done ko raja kii patni ke paas pahunchaane akaash main ud chalaa
 On the way, that predatory bird found another predatory bird
 donon pakshiyon main yuddh hone laga
 During the war, he got rid of both bird's claws and fell into Yamuna
 yamuna main brahma ke shaap se machhlee bani ek apsara rahati thi
 The nymph of fish swallowed semen flowing in both and due to its effect she became pregnant
 garbh purna hone par ek nishad ne us machhlee ko apane jaal main fasaa liya
 When Nishad cut the fish, a boy and a girl came out of his stomach
 nishad un shishuon ko lekar maharaj sudhanva ke paas gaya
 Due to not being the son of Maharaj Sudhanwa, he kept the child with him, named Matsyaraj
 balika nishad ke paas hi rah gai or uskaa naam matsaygandha rakhaa gaya kyonki uske angon se machhlee kii gandh nikalati thi
 That girl is also known as Satyavati
 badi hone par vah naav khene kaa kaary karne lagi ek baar parashar muni ko uski naav par baith kar yamuna paar karnaa padaa
 Parashar Muni Satyavati became enamored of beauty and said, "devi! i want to cum with you
 " satyavati ne kaha, "muniver! aap brahmagyani hai or main nishad kanya
 We do not have sex
 " tab parashar muni bole, "balike! tum chintaa mat karo
 You will remain a virgin even after childbearing
 " itnaa kah kar unhone apane yogabal se chaaron ore ghaney kuhare kaa jaal rach diya or satyavati ke saath bhoga kiya
 After that, while blessing him, he said, the smell of fish coming out of your body will turn into fragrant
 " When the time came, Satyavati had a son from Vedas, who passed from the womb
 janm hote hi vah balak bada ho gaya or apni mata se bolaa, "mata! tu jab kabhi bhi vipatti main mujhe samaran karegi, main upasthit ho jaaungaa
 "having said this, he went to the island of Dwaipayan to do penance
 dwaipayan dweep main tapasya karne tathaa unke sharir kaa rang kaala hone ke kaaran unhe krishna dwaipayan kaha jane laga
 Later on he became famous by the name of Ved Vyas because of commenting on the Vedas
 hindu dharm shastron ke anusaar maharishi vyas trikalgya the
 And seeing from the divine point of view, he knew that religion would be weakened in Kali Yuga

 Vyas Ji named him - Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda
 vedon kaa vibhaajan karne ke kaaran hi vyas ji veda vyas ke naam se vikhyath huye
 Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda taught their disciples Pal, Jaimin, Vaishampayan and Sumantumuni respectively

 In relation to the Mahabharata itself, Vyasji's statement is more accurate - what is in this text is elsewhere, but what is not in it is nowhere else
 kalapi main yamuna ke kisi dweep main inkaa janm hua tha
 Vyasji was called Krishna Dwaipayana because his color was black
 ve paidaa hote hi maan kii ajna se tapasya karne chale gayi the or kah gayi the ki jab bhi tum samaran karogi, main aa jaaoongaa
 He was not only the father of Dhritarashtra, Pandu and Vidur, but he also supported the Pandavas in the form of a shadow in times of calamity
