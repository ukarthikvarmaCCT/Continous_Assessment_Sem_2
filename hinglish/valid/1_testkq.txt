 angel aaiz vailes ko ajna detaa he ki vah tuko ko nirmamtapurvak pite or pratadit kare jisase vah sone ke gupt sthaan ke rup main sad hill kabristaan kaa pataa bataa de, lekin saath hi tuko unhen yah bhi bataa detaa he ki sirf blondi hi us kabr kaa naam jaanata he
 Angel Eyes proposes a share of equality in front of Blondie to find gold
 blondi taiyaar ho jaataa he or angel aaiz or uski tukdi ke saath chal padataa he
 Meanwhile, Tuco, who is tied up by the hero Wallace, is taken to another place by train to hang him
 is yatra ke dauraan, tuko vailes se kahata he ki use peshaab karnaa he or itane samay tak vailes kaa dhyaan duusari taraf lagaaye rahata he jisase use vailes ko pakadakar train se kudane kaa mauka mil sake
 iske baad vah ek chattan par vailes kaa sar martha he, jisase vah mar jaataa he or duusari train ke aane par chen ko katata he jisase vah train mrit vailes ko apane saath ghaseetati aage bad jaati he or tuko azaad ho jaataa he
 We then see Blondie, Angel Eyes, and Angel Eyes contingent arrive in a city that is being evacuated very quickly due to giant cannon attacks
 tuko bhi usee shahar ke dhwast avasheshon ke bich yun hi gum rahaa tha, vah ab us inami aparaadhiyon ko pakadaney vaale vyakti ke bare main bilkul bhul chukaa tha jo is film kii shuruyaat main batch jaataa he, vah tuko kaa peechha karata he or ek parityakt imaarat main nahaane ke dauraan us par ekaek akraman karata he
 Despite being shocked, Tuco shoots and kills the man who caught the prize
 blondi chalaayi gayi goli kii chaanbin karata he, is dauraan use tuko mil jaataa he or vah use angel aaiz ke hastkshep ke bare main bataata he
 The two resume their partnership, sneak around the demolished city and kill Angel Eyes' goons, until now they do not realize that Angel Eyes has escaped and a humiliating act for both of them The letter has left
 tuko or blondi ko sad hill kabristaan kaa rasta mil jaataa he, lekin vah vishaal union va sangh kii sena dwaara avarodhit he, union va sangh kii senaaon ke bich main maatr ek sankara pul he
 Each side is preparing to fight for it, but apparently both sides have been instructed not to destroy the bridge
 yah sochakar ki yadi pul nasht ho jaayegaa to "yah bevakoof ladaai ke liye kahin or chale jaayenge", blondi or tuko ne pul par taar kii sahaayta se dynamite bicha diya
 aisa karne ke dauraan donon apni apni jaankaree ek duusare ko bataate hai, tuko yah bataata he ki jis sthaan par sona gaada gaya he vah sthaan sad hill kabristaan hi he or blondi bataata he ki vah kabr jiske neeche sona he uskaa naam arq steinton he
 Then as the bridge is about to collapse, both of them hide and the armies start fighting again
 agali subah, union tathaa sangh ke sainik ja chuke hote hai
 Tuco leaves Blondie to extract gold from the cemetery by himself
 Like crazy, Tuco eventually finds the tomb of Arch Stainton after searching temporarily in that sea of memorial stones and traces temporarily placed on the graves
 jab vah vahaan gaddha karata he tabhi blondi aa jaataa he or uski ore ek khurpa phenkata he
 a moment later, the two are shocked to see Angel Eyes, who stops them at the tip of the gun
 blondi pair se markar steinton kii kabr kholta he to unhen vahaan par bas ek kankal dikhaayi padataa he
 Blondie inscribes the name of the real tomb, Blondie inscribes the name on a rock between the cemeteries and tells Tuco and Angel Eyes that "two hundred thousand dollars is a huge sum
" hamen ise kamanaa hoga
" The trio stare at each other in the circular center of the cemetery and during a well-known 5-minute Mexican standoff before making a sudden attack, anticipate who can accompany and pose threats
 blondi angel aaiz par goli chalaa detaa he, joki jhuke rahane ke dauraan waapas blondi par goli chalaane kii koshish karata he lekin blondi phir se us par goli chalaa detaa he or vah mrit avasthaa me ludhakte hue ek khuli kabr main ja girtaa he
 Tuco also tries to shoot Angel Eyes, but finds that Blondie had fired his shotgun the previous night
 blondi tuko ko "ananon" naamak kabr par le jaataa he jo arq steinton ke thik bagal main he
 Tuco digs the tomb and is overjoyed to find the sleeping bags inside it, but when he turns and looks towards Blondie, he is surprised to see a hanging noose
 tuko ne uske saath jo kiya tha uskaa badla lene ke liye, blondi use ek dagamagaate hue kabr ke pathar ke upar khadey hone ke liye vivash karata he or fande ko uski gardan ke chaaron ore daal detaa he, apane hisse kaa sona lekar jane se pehle vah tuko ke haath baandh detaa he
 When Tuco shouts begging for mercy, Blondie's figure appears again and he was aiming a rifle at Tuco
 blondi bas ek baar bandook chalaata he or fande kii rassi ko alag kar detaa he, jaise vah pehle kiya karata tha, isse sabase pehle tuko apane chehre ke bal apane hisse ke sone par ja girtaa he
 Tuco has his share of gold but does not have a horse, so he angrily shouts out, "hey Blondie! So Blondie smiles and goes
" tumhen pataa he tum kya ho? ek neech kutiya kii aulad!" ! do not talk

 Producers Alberto Grimaldi and Serigo Leone had no such plans, but with their blessings, Vincenzoni conceived the film as "about three crooks who are searching for a treasure during the American Civil War
" " studio is vichaar se sahamat ho gaya lekin vah is agali film kii laagat jaananaa chahta tha
 At the same time, Grimaldi was trying to tout an idea of his own, but Vincenzoni's idea was more beneficial

 Leon developed the story on the screenwriter's original concept of performing "war 


 the futility of the civil war that the film's characters face"

" batterville shivi jahaan blondi or tuko bandi banaaye gaye the vah andersenville kii steel kii nakkashi par aadhaarit tha
 Many of the scenes in the film are influenced by the archival portraits taken by Matthew Brady

" vincenjoni yah daawa karte hai ki unhone 11 dinon main vah patakatha likhi thi, lekin leone ke saath sambandh karaab ho jane ke kaaran unhone sheeghra hi vah film chhod di thi
 The three top characters are fully composed of Leon's autobiographical elements
 ek saakshaatkaar ke dauraan unhone kaha, " main koi bhav nahin hai, vah bahut hi saadhaaran shrenee ke peshewar hai
 Like a robot
 This is not the case with the other two

 Filming resumed in Rome's Sinesita Studios from mid-may 1966, including the opening scene between Clint and Wallach when an unnamed man first captures Tuco and is sent to prison
 iske baad nirmaan spain ke uttari ilaake main bergus ke sameep ke pathari kshetra main shuru kiya gaya, jo dakshin pashchimi sanyukt rajya se dugana tha or phir se pashchimi drishyon ko dakshin main almiria main filmaaya gaya
 This time the construction required more elaborate sets, including a town on which the cannon is fired, an elaborate prison camp and an American Civil War site; And in the main scenes of the end, hundreds of Spanish soldiers were employed to build a cemetery in which thousands of stones were used on the tomb which resembles the ancient Roman square
 The Spanish government gave permission for the production and filming of the film and provided military with technical assistance; The characters in the film included 1500 local army crew members as additional actors
 eastwood yaad karte hai ki, "yadi aap spain or spainvaasiyon ke bare main ek kahani par kaary kar rahe honge to avashya hi vah aapke kaam par dhyaan denge
 phir ve aapaki bahut gahan jaanch-padtaal karenge, lekin yah tathy ki aap ek pashchimi film ko rome main bana rahe hai jisko dakshin pashchim america yaa mexico main banaaya janaa chahie tha, tab vah aapaki kahani or vishay ke bare main or bhi chaanbin karenge

 Leon was instrumental in requesting Morricone a composition for the final Mexican stand-off scene in the cemetery, with the expression "corpses were laughing from within their tombs" and told the Daily Coulee to be enchanted
 Create a twisting effect that also includes dramatic close filming, so that the audience experiences the visual ballot effect
 prarambh main eastwood kahani se khush nahin the or unhen yah chintaa thi ki kahin vailaach unke charitra ko feekaa naa kar den or unhone leone se kaha ki, "pehali film main to mai akelaa hi tha
 In the second there were two persons

 If this continues, then in the next film, i will be found working with the American military
 "as Eastwood was not willing to accept the role, Eastwood was again seen as Rath Marsh, who asked him The third film was requested to be accepted and publicity disputes between the William Maurice Agency and Irving Leonard, who were unhappy with Marsh's influence on Clint
 Eastwood banned Marsh from further influencing his career and was forced to remove Marsh from his post of trade manager due to a letter sent to him by Frank Wells
 Eastwood's publicity work was being overseen by Jerry Palm of Gutman & Palm
 vailaach or eastwood ek saath madrid gaye or drishyon ke filmakan ke bich eastwood aaraam karte the or apane golf swing kaa abhyaas karte the
 During filming, Wallach was poisoned after he accidentally drank an acid bottle which was placed next to his soda bottle by a film technician
 vailaach ne iskaa zikr apni aatmakatha main kiya tha or yah shikaayat kii thi kii jahaan leone ek utkrisht abhinayta the, vahi duusari ore vah khatarnaak drishyon ke filmakan ke dauraan apane abhinaytaon kii suraksha sunishchit karne ke sambandh main bahut hi deele the
 For example, in a scene where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse standing beneath him had to run away with the sound of a bullet
 jab vailaach kii gardan kii rassi vibhajit ho gayi, to pistaul kii awaz se vah ghoda kuch zyada hi dar gaya
 He kept running for about a mile and Valach was still sitting on his back with Valach's hands tied behind his back
 teesri baar jab vailaach kii jaan khatre main pad gayi to is drishy main vah or mario brega - joki ek saath chen dwaara bandhe hue the - ek chalati hui train se kudate hai
 The jump from the train is completed as planned, but Wallach's life is threatened when the character he plays attempts to break the chain by which he was tied to the loyal goons
 tuko laash ko rail kii patariyon par rakhata he or pratiksha karata he ki train aaye or iske upar se guzar jaye jisase ki chen alag ho jaye

 For the first time, an Italian camera operator indicated that he was ready for filming, which was misunderstood by an army captain as the Spanish word "start" because the two words sound the same
 saubhaahgya se, is kusamay kii ghatana me koi bhi ghayal nahin hua
 The army re-created the bridge while other scenes were being filmed
 As the bridge was not an incumbent but a heavy and strong structure, powerful explosives were needed to demolish it
 leone ne kaha tha ki, unka drishy, kuch had tak, baster kitone kii mook film, da general se prerit tha
 Since the international characters were taken into the film, all the actors were working in their mother tongue
 eastwood, vine clif or vailaach angreji bolte the or rome main film ke pratham pradarshan ke liye unke sanvaadon ko italian bhashaa main dab kiya gaya tha
 For the American version, only the vocals from the top characters were used, but the supporting actors' dialogues were dubbed into English
 iskaa parinaam screen par hothon kii gati or swar ke madhya bure saamanjasy ke rup main drushtigochar hota he; koi bhi samvaad puri tarah se saamanjasy main nahin hai kyonki leone ne bahut kam hi avasaron par drishy ko samakalik swar ke saath filmaaya tha
 Several reasons were cited for this: Leon often preferred to play Morricone's music on the back of any scene, and possibly shouted something to get the actors into the scene
 leone samvaad kii apeksha drishyon par adhik dhyaan dete the 
 us samay kii takneekee simaaon ke chalate, leone dwaara praayah hi prayukt kiye jane vaale atyant lambe drishyon main awaz ko spasht rup se record kar paanaa kathin hota
 saath hi, us samay italian filmon main mook filmakan or phir sanvaadon ko dab kiya janaa ek maanak chalan tha
 Whatever the real reason, all the dialogues of the film were recorded after production
 eastwood or leone ke bich sambandh unke pichley sahakaarya ke samay se hi tanaavpurn chal rahe the or yues sanskaran ke liye samvaad dab kiye jane ke satron ke dauraan yah sambandh or bhi karaab ho gaye kyonki is dauraan abhinayta ko mul aalekh jis par ki filmakan hua tha uske sthaan par koi or hi aalekh thama diya gaya
 He refused to read the dialogue from this new version and insisted on reading the dialogue from the article used during filming
 leone sad hill kabristaan ke filmakan ke liye koi asli kabristaan khoj paane main asamarth the, isliye spanish aatishbaajee vidya ke pramukh ne 250 spanish sainikon ko bhaade par bulaayaa jisase ki salas de los infentes ke nikat, karajon main ek kabristaan banwaaya ja sake, jiskaa nirmaan kaary unhone do din main puraa kar liya tha
 By the end of the film Eastwood was fed up with Leon's eclectic directorial qualities, often forcibly, emphasizing the filming of scenes from multiple angles and also paying great attention to the following issues; Due to which the actors were often tired
 leone, joki bahut hi zyada khaane vaale the, apni ativaadee aadaton ke kaaran manoranjan kaa ek strot bhi the or eastwood unke sambandh main mazaaq banaakar or unhen unke bure swabhaav ke kaaran "yosemit sam" kaa upnaam dekar apane un tanaavon ko shant kar lete the jo unhen leone ke sangrakshan main nirdeshit hone ke kaaran hota tha
 Eastwood had decided that he would not work under Leon's direction again, so he later turned down the role of Harmonica in Once Upon a Time in the West, the story of which Leon himself came to Los Angeles to tell him, The role was eventually given to Charles Brosnan
 kai varshon baad, vans apon a time in america ke filmakan ke dauraan leone ne clint se apana badla liya, jab unhone eastwood kii pratibha kaa varnan karte hue kaha ki ek abhinayta ke rup main unki kshamta sangemarmar yaa mom ke ek tukade jaisi he or robert de nero kii abhinay kshamta se kahin kam he, unke dwaara kii gayi tippanee is prakaar thi, "visphoton or goliyon kii barish ke bich eastwood ek neend main chalane vaale vyakti kii tarah chalate hai or vah sadaiv aise hi rahenge - ek sangemarmar ke tukade kii tarah

 In light of the fact that II Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cativo's English translation is literally: The Good, the Ugly, the Bad, which overturns the two adjectives of the end, the original Italian release is promoted in Tuco, Angel Eyes k comes first and when translated into English accidentally gets Angel Eyes as "the Next" and Tuco as "the Bad"

 "roger Ebert Jinne later ranked the film on his list of Great Movies, reviewing that in his original review he had" interpreted the film as a 4-star film but only 3 stars
 Was given, perhaps because it was a Western spaghetti and therefore could not fall into the category of art film
 ' abert bhi leone ke us vishisht drushtikon kii ore sanket karte hai jo darshakon ko paatro ke sameep aane main sahaayta karata he kyonki aise main darshak bhi vahi dekh pate hai jo paatr dekhtaa he
 Sergio Leone established a rule that he follows throughout The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
 The rule is that the ability to see is limited by the sides of the frame
 At important moments in the film, what the camera cannot see, the characters cannot see, and that gives Leone the freedom to surprise us with entrances that cannot be explained by the practical geography of his shots
 There is a moment, for example, when men do not notice a vast encampment of the Union Army until they stumble upon it; a moment in a cemetery when a man materializes out of thin air even though he should have been visible much sooner; the way men walk down a street in full view and nobody is able to shoot them ,

 In the late 1930s, Swiss physicist Walter Jagger tried to invent a sensor for toxic gas
 He hoped that the gas entering the sensor would be bound to ionized air molecules and for that reason would change the electric current in the circuit of the device
 Their device failed: small concentrations of gas had no effect on the conductivity of the sensor
 Frustrated, Jaeger lit a cigarette — and they were soon surprised to see that a meter of the instrument had informed the current

 Analog addressable detectors provide information about the amount of smoke in their detection area, so that facps themselves can decide whether there is an alarm condition in that area
 These typically compare autonomously judged detectors Are more expensive

 While current technology is very effective in detecting smoke and fire conditions, the deaf and hard of hearing community has created some high-risk groups such as the elderly, hearing-impaired, and alert people who are awake Concerns have been raised about the impact of the work

 However, it is common for households to have smoke detectors with dead batteries
 britain main yah anumaan he ki 30% se adhik smoke alarmon main mrit batariyaan yaa batariyaan nikaali hui ho sakati hai
 As a result, a public information campaign has been prepared to remind people regarding the regular replacement of smoke detector batteries

 Some detectors are also being sold with lithium batteries that can last 7 to 10 years, although this may actually make it less likely for people to change batteries, as they are sometimes needed to replace
 us samay tak, puure detector ko badalane kii jarurat ho sakati he
 Although relatively expensive, user-replaceable 9-volt lithium batteries are also available
 aam nimh or nicd punah charge karne yogya badariyon kaa ek ucch swat: anavesh dar hota he jo unhen dhune vaale detectaron main upyog ke liye anupyukt bana detaa he
 This is true although they can provide much more power than alkaline batteries when used in portable stereos, just after charging
 iske alaava, punah charge badariyon ke saath ek samasya unke upyogi charge ke ant main voltage main teji se kami hona he
 This is a concern in devices such as smoke detectors, because the battery can "charge" from "charged" so fast that the low-battery warning period from the detector is either so short that it is ignored
 Or they do not occur at all

 In 2004, NIST released a comprehensive report concluding that other items included "smoke alarms with ionization type or photoelectric type giving residents consistent time to escape most fires in homes" and "earlier Consistent with the findings, ionization-type alarms produced better responses than photoelectric alarms in case of a blazing fire

 All smoke detectors must be directly connected to electrical wires, interconnected and have a battery backup
 In addition, smoke detectors are required within or outside each sleeping room depending on local regulations

 kuch kshetron main seedhi margon, mukhya galiyaaron evam gairaajon main bhi smoke detectaron kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Wired units with a third "interconnected" wire allow a dozen or more detectors to be connected so that if one detects smoke the alarm will ring across all the detectors in the network, which increases this probability It will allow residents to be alerted, even if they are inside a closed door or the alarm is set one or two floors away from their place
 Wired interconnection can be practical to use only in new construction, especially if the wire needs to be moved to areas where it cannot be reached without piercing walls or roofs
 2000 ke dashak ke madhya tak, zigbi jaise takneekon kaa istemaal kar wireles ke dwaara network kiye hue smoke alarmon ke kshetra main vikaas shuru ho chukaa he, jo aapas main jude hue alarmon ko mahange taar lagaae bina imaarat main aasaani se pun:sthapit karne kii anumati pradaan karegaa
