 shakti kaa yantric sancharan patte yaa rajju kii sahaayta se shift dwaara, athwa yantrichakr or zanjeer kii sahaayta se hota he
 These methods are used differently, or with each other, to transmit power according to the situation
 mul chaalak ke anusaar shaktisancharan ke yantric upkarnon kaa abhikalp evam nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 The power is transmitted to the line shaft by the strap on the driving wheel of the original driver
 rekha shift par abhikalp ke anusaar ghiraniyaan lagi rahati hai
 The power is transmitted from the lineshaft to various devices by a strap attached to those pulleys
 is prakaar kii pranali main sabase bada avagun yah he ki kisi bhi karanvash rekhashaft kaa chalanaa band hote hi sabhi yantra, jinhen rekhashaft se shakti sancharit kii jaati he, bekaar ho jate hai
 For quantitative analysis of this type of power transmission, the crank shaft of the engine is taken as the starting point of transmission and the first moving shaft of the device as the end point of transmission
 yah anumaan vishisht yatra ke liye upyukt he
 Let the engine speed is n revolutions per minute
 is gati par chalate hue ingine crankashaft par lagaataar bal adhurna daalata rahata he
 Assuming that the quantity of force base is t kg per meter
 is avasthaa main ingine kii koniya gati w, kaa mulya hoga 2 x pai x n / 60
 Here the unit of w is radians per second
 at: ingine crank shift dwaara kiye gaye kaary kii dar wt kilogram prati meter prati second he
 Assuming for convenience, the entire power received from the crank shaft is transmitted to a single device
 maan liya, us yantra par daalaa janevaala bal aghurna T1 kilogram prati meter he or w1 radian prati second yantra kii koniya gati he, tab us yantra dwaara praapt urja kii dar hogi w1t1 kilogram meter prati second
 Some part of the energy is absorbed by the transmission to overwhelm friction and other obstructions
 yadi aisa nahin ho, to yantra dwaara urja avasorana kii dar mul chaalak dwaara utpann urja kii dar ke samatuly hogi
 But in practice this does not happen
 jab ek shift mul chaalak se kisi yantra ko shakti sancharit karata he, to iske prayek anubhag ko balaghurna kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 If the volume of force is t kg per meter and the shaft w radian is moving at an angular speed of per second, the rate of transmission will be wt kg meter per second
 shift kaa dizin banaate samay, uske aakaar evam pariman kaa pataa lagaana hota he
 In this connection, it is noted that the stress generated by the force must remain within a specific range
 shift kaa dizin kabhi kabhi is aadhaar par bhi kiya jaataa he ki shift ke aksh se lambkoniya sthit do anubhaagon ke aapekshik koniya visthaapan kaa maan ek vishisht kone se kam hi rahe
 Different equations are incorporated for different shaped shafts and they are used to design
 jaisaa upar bataaya ja chukaa he, saadhaarant: yah anumaan kar liya jaataa he ki marod ek samaan hoga, kintu vastut: marod kaa maan sarvada parivartit hota rahata he, yah ek samaan nahin rah paata he
 For the transformed states the value of the mismatch stress is chosen accordingly
 in vishmataaon ke alaava ek baat or dhyaan dene yogya he ki kisi bhi shift ko keval marod kaa hi saamana nahin karnaa padataa he, varan marod ke saath hi banken aghurna kaa bhi saamana karnaa padataa
 Actually designing the shaft is not as simple as it seems
 shift kaa dizin banaate samay, in sari vishmataaon ko dhyaan main rakhana padataa he evam avasthaanusaar uske pariman kaa maan karnaa hota he
 Sometimes power is transmitted to different instruments from the same shaft
 aise yantron ko alag alag sthanon par sthapit kiya jaataa he evam ye saare yantra shift ke vibhinn bhaagon se shakti praapt karte hai
 In this state of power transmission, naturally, the part of the shaft closest to the original conductor has to transmit the entire power, and as other instruments receive power from different parts of the shaft, the power transmitted by the shaft decreases
 isliye mul chaalak ke nikatatam shift ke bhaag kii shakti kaa pariman adhiktam hoga or shift ke vibhinn bhaagon kii duuri ke anusaar shakti kaa pariman bhi kam hota jayega
 The dental wheel is used to transmit power from one shaft to another
 do shift samaantar avasthaa main rakhe jate hai, yaa ek duusare se kuch kone par jhuke rahete hai
 First stage cycles are spur gear and second stage cycles are called bevel gear
 gear kaa dizin bahudhaa sthir gati anupaat ke liye kiya jaataa he kintu kabhi-kabhi vishisht yantron ke liye parivarti gati ke anumaan ke aadhaar par bhi gear kaa dizin bananaa hota he
 Like the shaft, the magnitude of the denticle also depends on the force
 shaktisancharan ke liye dantichakra kaa vyavhaar in sthanon main kiya jaataa he, jaise jahaaj main sthit, ucchgati bhaap tarabine se nimna gati pranodak main shaktisancharit karne main tathaa motor gaadi main vyavahrut gear box aadi main
 a special thing to be noted while constructing a denticle is that the uniformity of intervals is obtained with extreme precision
 yadi antaraal ek samaan na ho, to dantichakron dwaara ucch gati par atyadhik kolahal hoga, jo avaanchhneeya he
 Therefore, in the modern method, the denticles are hardened and conveyed in precise gaps and shapes by micro-transmission mill
 shaktisancharan main saadharantaya yah bhi vyavhaar main laayaa jaataa he
 For this, leases are offered on two pulleys
 jab ghirani ek samaan gati par gumti he, tab ek ghirani se duusari ghirani main shakti sancharit hoti rahati he
 In this state, the strap remains tight on one side and loose on the other side, but there is tension on both sides
 shakti kaa sancharan karanevaale yantron main shrunkhlaa kaa sthaan bhi mahatvapurn he
 Its main properties are: vibhinn prakaar kii shrunkhalaayen, jo vyavhaar main aati hai, unamem se mukhya ye hai : Detachable, malleable iron chain - This type of chain is made by joining malleable iron rings
 iskaa dizin is prakaar banaaya jaataa he ki sangyojan main suvidha ho
 This type of chain behaves mostly in the state of 40 rotations per minute and speed ratios of 5 and 1, ispaat belan shrunkhlaa - pratham prakaar kii shrunkhlaa nimnagati ke yogya he
 The modern era is the era of high speed
 isliye ucch gati par shakti preshit karne ke liye ispaat kii shrunkhlaa halki banaavat kii hoti he evam isamen antaraal bahut yatharth rakhaa jaataa he
 Medium-carbon-heat-insulated steel is used in its construction
 is shrunkhlaa 700 ghurna prati minute evam 5 gati anupaat tak kii avasthaa main vyahrut hoti he, Nirav Series - Its place is more important in chains designed for power transmission
 ucch shakti ko ucch gati par preshit karne ke liye iskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Its links are designed and constructed by very careful and specific methods
 is prakaar kii shrunkhlaa kaa vyavhaar mukhyat: 1,200 se 1,500 ghurna prati minute evam 15 gati anupaat ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Long ago, rope was also used for power transmission
 ghirani kii parima par banaae gaye khaanche par rajju ko lapetakar uske dwaara shakti preshit kii jaati he
 Since the rope is less ductile than the strap, it should be noted that power is transmitted by a cord with a lower diameter than a cord with a lower diameter than the diameter of the rope
 patte kii tulana main rajju kaa kriyasheel pratibal bahut hi kam hota he, kintu tanaav bal kaa anupaat atyadhik hota he
 Due to science, in the modern era, a low power basic driver, which requires less cost to manufacture, is being built, but the efficiency of this basic driver is higher
 iske saath hi saath yantric shaktipreshan kii vidhiyon main ye vidhiyaan pramukh hai : Direct motor coupled relationship - In this the motor and the power receiving shaft are related to each other by coupling
 yah yugman bahudhaa namya prakaar kaa hota he
 Such a connection is compact and this coupling is used to drive modern instruments; pratyaksh motor patt sambandh - isamen motor or shakti praapt karanevaale shift ke bich patta laga rahata he
 It is practiced in operating various mechanical devices
 kahin kahin patte ke sthaan par shrunkhlaa kaa bhi upyog kiya jaataa he; Strap and Line Shaft - This method is described above; gear newnikaran pranali - vidyut motor bahudhaa ucch gati par hi chalata he, kintu yantron ke shakti praapt karanevaale shift ko nimna gati par hi kaary karnaa hota he
 Naturally, by directly connecting the motor and shaft, the shaft will start running at the same high speed
 isliye shakti ko motor se shift main preshit karne ke liye gati ke newnikaran kii atyant aavashyaktaa ho jaati he or yah kaary yantrit newnikaran pranali dwaara hi sampann hota he
 Power can be reduced by this system in the ratio of 50 and 1 and sometimes even in the ratio of 100 and 1; bahu tantu rajju pranali - is pranali kaa prachaar haal main aarambh hua he
 The ropes are made of the English letter v shape and work on a v shaped groove made at the perimeter of the circles
 yah pranali kisi bhi prakaar ke yantra ke pratyaksh chaalan main vyahrut hone yogya he tathaa Variable speed relations - This type of relationship is used in a variety of industrial methods
 isamen gati kaa parivartan sugamawapurvak evam bina kisi baadha ke hi sampann ho jaataa he
 Sometimes a combination of some of the systems mentioned above is treated for lack of space
 aadhunik vidhiyon main sanhat kaa hona adhik mahatvapurn he, saath hi saath in vidhiyon dwaara adhik dakshata praapt kii ja sakati he or sampurna vyay bhi kam hi hota he
 The hydraulic system is the most modern of the methods of power transmission
 dravchaalit pranali main shakti ek taral kii sahaayta se preshit kii jaati he
 This liquid is often oil, but sometimes water is also treated
 dravchaalit pranali ko do vibhaagon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he : Numerous efforts are being made to utilize the gas transmission dispatch
 is vidhi kaa mukhya upyog railgadiyon main adhik hota he
 Research is still being done in this area, as the efficiency of these methods is very low
 aashaa kii jaati he, nikat bhavishya main anveshak gana apane prayog main safal ho sakenge or is pranali kii upyogita anya kshetron main or bhi adhik bad jaaegi

 It does not aim for rapid change or fundamental change
 isaliye yah 'krantikari aandolan' se bhinn he

 It has nine square rooms including the main central chamber
 inamen bich main bane mukhya kaksh ko ghere hue shesh aath dumanjile kaksh bich main khulte hai
 The main chamber is domed and double-storey in height and consists of a tomb of the second Mughal emperor Humayun in a lattice enclosure with eight ridges in the very middle below the dome
 ye imaarat kii mukhya kabr he
 Its entrance is on the southern side with a single EVAN, and the evans of other directions have a network of white confluence
 samraat kii asli samadhi thik neeche aantarik kaksh main bani he, jiskaa rasta baahar se jaataa he
 Just above it is a showy but beautiful replica
 neeche tak aam paryatakon ko pahunch nahin di gai he
 The entire building uses a marble mosaic called the Petra Dura and this type of tomb placement is an important part of indo-islamic architecture, which has been used extensively in the later tombs of the Mughal Empire, such as the Taj Mahal
 mukhya kaksh main sangmarmar kii jalidaar ghere ke thik upar mehrab bhi bana he, jo pashchim main makka kii ore bana he
 There is a line of sura-un-noor, usually at the entrance, instead of Sura 24 of the Quran, through which light enters the Qibla
 is prakaar samraat kaa str unke virodhiyon or pratidwandiyon se ooncha devatv ke nikat ho jaataa he
 The principal room has four octagonal rooms at four angles, connected by an arched gallery
 pradhan kaksh kii bhujaaon ke bich bich main chaar anya kaksh bhi bane hai
 These eight rooms make a circumambulation of the main tomb, as seen in Sufism and many other Mughal tombs; At the same time, they also indicate Paradise in the religion of Islam
 in prayek kamaron ke saath 8-8 kamare or bane hai, jo kul milakar 124 kakshiya yojana kaa ang hai
 In these small rooms, the tombs of many Mughal Nawabs and courtiers are built from time to time
 inamen se pramukh hai hamida bano begum or daara shikoh kii kabren
 Including the first floor, this main building has more than 100 tombs, most of which do not have the identity of the person buried due to the inscription, but it is certain that they are from the royal family or courtiers of the Mughal Empire
 Were, so the building is labeled as the cemetery of the Mughals
 is imaarat main laal baluapathar par shwet sangmarmar ke sangyojan kaa sarvapratham prayog kiya gaya tha
 Along with this, there are many components of Indian architecture, such as small canopies of Rajasthani architecture enclosing the main dome, which were originally covered with blue tiles

 chote kaksh mehrabadar jaali se dhanke hue hai
 The construction of the main building took eight years, but its full beauty is enhanced by the Charbagh-style Mughal gardens spread over 30 acres surrounding it
 ye udyaan bharat hi nahin varan dakshin asia main apni prakaar ke pehle udhaaharan the
 These are examples of high-grade geometry
 jananath rupi udyaan chaharadivari ke bheetar bana he
 The park is divided into four sections by walking paths and two dividing central waterways
 ye islam ke jananath ke baag main bahane vaali chaar nadiyon ke parichaayak hai
 The four gardens thus constructed are again divided into four smaller parts by stone paths
 is prakaar kul milakar 36 bhaag banate hai
 The central water pipe from the main gate to the mausoleum seems to go under it and reappear from the other side, just as the 'garden of paradise' is described in the verses of the Quran
 makbare ko ghere hue charbagh hai, va unhen ghere hue teen ore oonchi pathar kii chaharadivari he va teesri ore kabhi nikat hi yamuna nadi baha karti thi, jo samay ke saath parisar se dur chali gai he
 Central walkways lead to two gates: one main gate in the southern wall and the other small gate in the western wall
 ye donon dwaar dumanjila hai
 Of these, the western gate is now used, and the southern gate used to be in the Mughal period and is now closed

 humayun ke makbare ke mukhya pashchimi praveshdwar ke raste main anek anya smarak bane hai
 The chief monument of these is the tomb of Isa Khan Niazi, which was built in 1547, 20 years before the main tomb
 isa khan niyazi mughalon ke viruddh ladane vaala sur vansh ke shaasha shershah suri ke darbar kaa ek afgaan nawab tha
 This tomb was built during the life of Isa Khan and after that it worked for his whole family only

 This mausoleum is now destroyed and from the remains it is known that it was not located in the center

 After this comes the Arabian inn which was built by Hamida Begum for the artisans engaged in the construction of the main mausoleum
 is parisar main hi afasarvaala makbara bhi bana he, jo akbar ke ek nawab ke liye bana tha
 Along with this, its mosque is also built

 It derives its name from the blue glazed tiles above its dome
 ye makbara akbar ke darbari bairam khan ke putr abdul rahim khanekhana dwaara apane sevak miyaan fahim ke liye banwaaya gaya tha
 Fahim Mian grew up with his son Firoz Khan and along with him, he fought in the rebellion of Mahabat Khan, a Mughal commander during Jahangir's time in 1625 / 26

 Bandura was born in Mandari, Alberta, Canada, in an open city of roughly four hundred inhabitants
 vah sabhi 6 bhai-bahanon main sabase chote hai or vah apane parivaar main iklaute bete hai
 In a remote city like this, Bandura was independent and self-motivated in terms of learning because of the limitations of education, and these mainly developed traits proved to be of great help in his long career

 Noam Chomsky reviewed BFF Skinner's verbal behavior in 1959, which challenged the practical approach to the study of effective language and behavior at the time and contributed to the cognitive revolution in psychology
 chomuski 'uttejnaa', 'pratikriya' or ' sudrudheekaran' ke manamaane vichaaron ke bare main jatilta se sochate the, ye vichaar skinner ne prayogshaala main jantu prayogon ke dwaara praapt kiye
 Chomsky argued that Skinner's ideas could only be applied to complex human behavior such as language acquisition in a vague and superficial way
 chomuski ne is baat par jor diya ki anusandhan or vishleshan ke dauraan, bhashaa ke adhigrahan main ek bachche ke yogadan kii upeksha nahin kerani chahie or prastaavit kiya ki maanav bhashaa ke adhigrahan kii prakritik kshamta ke saath paidaa hue hai
 Much of the work related to psychologist Albert Bandura, who introduced and studied social learning theory, showed that children can learn aggression from their role models through observational learning, during which there is no change in their open behavior and It can be considered a sub internal process
 prekshnatmak adhigam dusron kaa prekshan karne se ghatit hota he adhigam k is rup ko pehle anukaran kaha jaataa tha
 Bandura and his colleagues conducted a detailed investigation of observational learning in several experimental studies
 is prakaar ke adhigam main vyakti saamaajik vyavhaaron ko sikhta he, isliye harne kabhi-kabhi saamaajik adhigam bhi kaha jaataa he! hamaare saamne aisi anek saamaajik sthitiyaan aati hai, jinamein yah gyaat nahin rahata ki hamen kaisaa vyavhaar karnaa chahie
 In such situations, we observe the behavior of other people and behave like them
 is prakaar ke adhigam ko modelling kaha jaataa he
 In a famous experiment, children were shown a film of five minutes duration
 film main ek bade kamare main bahut se khilone rakhe the or unamem ek khilonaa ek bada sa gudda tha
 Now an older boy enters the room and looks around
 ladkaa sabhi khilaunon ke prati krodh pradarshit karata he or bade khilone ke prati vishesh rup se aakraamak ho uthta he
 He kills Gudde, throws him to the floor, stumbles and falls and then sits on him
 iske baad kaa ghatnakram teen alag roopon main teen filmon main taiyaar kiya gaya
 In one film, a group of children saw that a boy who behaved aggressively was rewarded and one person praised his aggressive behavior
 duusari film main bacchon ke duusare samooh ne dekha ki us ladke ko uskaa aakraamak vyavhaar ke liye dandit kiya gaya
 In the third film, the third group of children saw that the boys were neither rewarded nor punished
 Thus three groups of children were shown three different films
 filmein dekhne ke baad sabhi bacchon ko ek alag praayogic kaksh main bithakar unhen vibhinn prakaar ke khilaunon se khilne ke liye swatantra chhod diya gaya or un samoohon ko chhipakar dekha gaya or unke vyavhaaron ko note kiya gaya
 Those who found that children who had seen aggressive behavior towards toys in the film were rewarding were the most aggressive towards toys
 sabase kam aakraamakata un bacchon ne dikhain jinhone film main aakraamak vyavhaar ko dandit hote hue dekha tha
 This experiment makes it clear that all children learned aggression from the events depicted in the film and also imitated the model
 prekshan dwaara adhigam kii prakriya main prekshak model ke vyavhaar kaa prekshan karke gyaan praapt karata hai paratu vah kis prakaar se aacharan karegaa yah is par nirbhar karata he ki model ko puraskrit kiya gaya yaa dandit kiya gaya
