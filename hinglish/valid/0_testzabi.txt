 The competition currently consists of 37 teams, with 21 of the 29 states in India and Delhi representing at least one
 pratiyogita pehle bhartiya cricketer hai, jo england or sasex, ranjitsinghji jo bhi "ranjai" main janaa jaataa tha ke liye khelaa ke naam par he
 The Cricket Championship of India was started as a meeting of the Board of Control for Cricket in India in July 1934, with the competition first taking place in 1934–35

 madras em je en gopaalan curtis ko pehali gend par bold kiya
 They defeated North India in the final after the first Ranji Trophy Championship was won by Bombay
 mumbai 1958-59 se 1972-73 ke liye 15 back-tu-back jeet sahit 41 jeet ke saath toornament ke samay kii sabase adhik sankhya jeet liya he
 State teams and cricket associations and clubs with first class status are eligible to play in the Ranji Trophy
 jabaki sabase association kshetreey hai, tamilnadu cricket sangh or mumbai cricket sangh jaise kuch rail or sevaaon kii tarah akhil bhartiya hai
 From its inception until the 2001–02 season, in 1952–53 with North, West, East and South Central, teams were geographically classified into four or five zones
 praarambhik maichon main 1956-57 tak ek nakout aadhaar par kshetron ke bheetar khelaa gaya tha, or uske baad ek lig aadhaar par ek vijeta kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye; uske baad, paanch alag-alag kshetra ke vijetaon ko ek naak out toornament main hissaa, ek antim jo ranjai trophy ke vijeta kaa faisla karne ke liye agrani
 From the 1970–71 season, each region of the knock-out stage was expanded to the top two teams by a total of ten qualifying teams
 yah 1992-93 main sheersh teen prayek kshetra se karne ke liye phir se vistaar kiya gaya tha, pandrah kwalifing tiimon ke kul; 1996-1997 or 1999-2000 ke bich, pandrah kwalifing timen ek madhyamik group charan main hissaa, paanch tiimon ke teen samoohon, or sheersh do prayek samooh ke ek chah team naak out charan ke liye kwalifai se saath; 2001-02 tak anya sabhi varshon main, ek purna pandrah team nokout toornament yojit kiya gaya
 The format was abandoned in the 2002–03 season with the zonal system abandoned and adopted a two-division structure - the Elite Group, containing fifteen teams, and the Plate Group, the rest
 prayek samooh ke do up samoohon jo ek round robin khelaa he; sheersh do-do sambhraant up-samooh se to ranjai trophy ke vijeta kaa nirdhaaran karne ke liye ek chaar team naak out toornament chunaav ladaa
 The team that went past finishing in each elite sub-group, and both were promoted for the season after the plate group finals
 2006-07 satr ke liye, divijanon phir se label super lig or kramshah lig plate the
 In the 2008–09 season, this format was adjusted to give both the Super League an opportunity to contest the Ranji Trophy and to plate the league teams
 sheersh do-do plate up-samooh se chunaav ladaa semifinal; in do maichon ke vijetaon to ek aath team naak out toornament main prayek super lig up-samooh se sheersh teen main shaamil ho gaye
 The winner of this knockout tournament then won the Ranji Trophy

 Won the Ranji Trophy in the 2010–11 season following the start of the season in the Rajasthan Plate League
 2012-13 ke satr se, is praaroop main thodaa samyojit kiya gaya
 Super League and Plate League names were omitted, but the two-tier system remained
 sheersh stareey atharah tiimon ke liye pandrah tiimon se vistaar main nau main se do up samoohon main; or duusari shrenee ke ek samooh main nau tiimon ke liye kam ho gaya tha
 The knockout stage from the top three teams from Group a and b and the top two from Group c competition
 group e or group bi main se prayek main kam rakhaa team group si main chalaa jaataa he, or sheersh do group si se sheersh stareey karne ke liye protsaahit kar rahe hai
 Round robin matches are four days in length; Knockout matches are played for five days
 iske itihaas ke dauraan, agar vahaan ek ranjai trophy nokout match main koi ekamusth parinaam he, team ke pehali pari ke baad pramukh vijeta he
 The following 28 teams currently participate in the Ranji Trophy: chhattisgarh 2016-17 main pehali baar toornament main khele
 The following teams have appeared in the Ranji Trophy, but now do so: donon divijanon ke lig charan main ank vartmaan main is prakaar ke rup main sammanit kiya jaataa he: † Some sources credit Goel with 636 or 640 wickets instead - see Rajinder Goel article for details
 bombai / mumbai 2017-18 tak 84 final main se 46 main khel chuke hai or 41 ranjai trophy championships, kisi bhi team dwaara sabase zyada jeet liya he
 Crime or conviction is defined in different forms; As such, in paribhaashaon ke anusaar kisi nagarpalika ke banaae niyamon kaa ulanghan kar yadi koi raat main bina batti jalaae cycle par nagar kii sadak par chale athwa bina paryaapt kaaran ke train kii zanjeer khinchakar gaadi khadi kar de, to vah bhi usee prakaar doshi mana jayega, jis tarah koi kisi kii hatya karne par
 But in the ordinary sense, people take the punishment as synonymous with murder, dacoity and other crimes
 loukik mat ke anusaar koi chaalak yadi teji evam asaavadhaanee se motor chalaate hue kisi ko apni gaadi se kuchal de to vah apradhi nahin kaha ja saktaa, yadi uske man main aparaadh karne kii bhaavana na rahi ho
 According to the traditional beliefs, there are two things for the completion of the conviction - yadi koi chori karne ke abhipraay se kisi ke ghar kii khidki se ghar ke andar kii chizon ko dekhe tathaa raatri main send lagaakar chori karne kii yojana banaakar hi laut jaay to usapar chori ke aparaadh kaa abhiyog nahin lagaaya ja saktaa, kyonki apradhi man kii yojana kaa karyanvayan nahin hua, bhale hi duusare ke ghar main anadhikaar pravesh karne ke liye vah doshi kyon na ho
 For the perfection of the crime of theft, it is necessary to touch the things of others at least
 at: vah vyakti yadi apni yojana ke anusaar raatri main send lagaakar us ghar kii chijen uthaa le jaay tabhi vah chori ke liye apradhi hoga
 But with the development of modern civilization, due to the complexity in the society, new laws are being made every day, due to which the defective mind theory of impunity is disappearing
 saadhaarant: jo swayan aparaadh kare yaa dusron ke dwaara aparaadh karaave, vahi dandit hoga
 Therefore, the owner cannot be liable for the trespass offense of his servant
 kintu ek simit varg ke maamalon main, jahaan aparaadh karne kii maansik pravriti aavashyak nahin he, yadi koi sevak apane saadhaaran kaary ke dauraan main koi aparaadh kare yaa kanoon dwaara nirdhaarit kisi kaam ko na karne se apradhi bane, to unka swami aparaadh ke liye uske saath saath doshi hoga; bhale hi swami ko sevak ke kaam kii yaa nirdhaarit kaam main truti kii khabar na rahi ho, yaa sevak ne swami ke aadesh ke viruddh kii kaam kyon na kiya ho athwa nirdhaarit kaam karne se virat hua ho
 There can be different reasons for conviction; As such, momentary impulses, sentimentality, forethought, protection from future destruction, etc
 drushtaant ke liye raajnneetik hatyaon ko le sakate hai
 In order to fulfill a political goal, some people conspire and kill the head of state
 aisa purv vichaar se hi hota he, kshanik aaveg se nahin
 The direct killer commits a crime out of sentimentality, greed for money, or the accomplishment of his team's target
 uske giraftaar hone par is ashanka se ki kahin vah rahasy kaa udghaatan kar apane saathiyon kaa vinaash na karvaa de, shadyantrakaari uskaa vadh kar dete hai
 Likewise, when a robber falls injured while robbery, his companions cut him off his head for being unable to carry him, so that he cannot be identified by his dead body or get forgiveness when he is alive
 With assurance, he should not reveal the secret of his team
 janm yaa anuvanshikta kaa dandabhiyog se kya sambandh he, nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa; kintu ham vaataavaran ke prabhaav asweekaar nahin kar sakate
 It is a simple experience that the foul atmosphere encourages the feeling of crime
 choron kii sangati main yadi kisi shishu ko rakh diya jaay to kramash: uski manovriti chori kii ore agrasar avashya hogi
 Thus, if a low-profile amateur criminal is kept in jail with ordinary prisoners, the impact of this situation may motivate him to commit a crime when he is freed from imprisonment
 at: pragatisheel samaaj main shaukia aparaadhiyon ko dandabhiyog se virat karne ke abhipraay se aparaadh ko protsaahan denevaale vaataavaran se pruthak rakhane kii yojana kii gai he
 Even before the First World War in England, an institution called Vorstal opened
 shaukia tathaa kam avasthaa ke aparaadhiyon kaa sudhaar karnaa inkaa uddeshy tha
 This institution opened in other progressive countries respectively
 probeshan act bhi lagu hua
 Child and youth offenders are released on probation if their parents are assured of good conduct by not keeping them in jail when they are punished for the crime
 yadi hatya aadi gurutam aparaadhon ke liye ve dandit hue hai, to unhen borstal sanstha ke hawaale kiya jaataa he
 This institution maintains a healthy environment, which helps in the improvement of criminals
 unhen upyogi vyavsaay kii bhi shiksha di jaati he, taaki dand kii nirdhaarit avadhi puri kar ghar lautne par ve sachai se apni jeevika chalaa saken
 a person can be a criminal either himself or in the form or can be helpful before or after the incident
 koi yaa to swayan aparaadh karata he yaa anya kisi agent se karaata he, jo kanuunan aparaadh ke liye uttaradaayi nahin hota, yatha saat saal se kam avasthaa kaa shishu, koi pashu yaa koi mashin
 Such a person is called the prime culprit
 dwitiya shrenee kaa pradhan vah he jo ghatnasthal par upasthit rahakar pradhan ko aparaadh karm main sahaayta detaa he yaa use protsaahit karata he
 The assistant before the incident is the one who encourages the head to commit the crime but is not present at the time of the crime
 ghatana se pashchaat kaa sahaayak vah he jo yah jaanate hue ki kisi ne gurutar aparaadh kiya he, use sharan detaa he yaa use bhaagane main sahaayta pahunchaata he
 It is worth remembering that all the people involved in treason are the main culprits
 dand kii gurutta evam laghutaa kii drushti se ukt shreneekaran upyogi he
 Criminal offenses are generally divided into the following classes: raashtra kii aantarik evam bahya suraksha ke viruddh, Against being brought to the court of justice and against the public officials, saadhaaran janata ke viruddh, Snake kidnapping
 kanoon kaa agyaan dandabhiyog ke bachaav main sweekaar nahin kiya jaataa
 a foreigner who is not aware of the law of another country cannot offer this defense, although the rigor of a sentence can often be reduced
 jin maamalon main doshapurn man aavashyak he, vahaan durghatana bachaav main lee ja sakati he
 The accused may accept the indictment brought against him, stating that he was acting in a legal manner, but due to obscenity, without accidental neglect, the accident occurred
 yadi kisi vyakti yaa uski sampatti kaa anadhikaar sparsh ho to maamla chalaanevaale kii sweekruti purna bachaav he
 But if this approval is obtained through fraud, threat or violence, then it will not be recognized
 yadi do vyakti apni aatmahatya kii yojana banaaen evam us yojana ke anusaar ek aatmghaat kar le, kar doosraa batch jaay to doosraa pehle kii hatya ke liye abhiyukt hoga
 It is beyond anyone's ability to approve that he will not bring a penalty
 kanoon dwaara nirdisht kuch apwaadon ko chhodkar dandabhiyog kii koi avadhi bharat yaa england main nahin he
 The accused is always responsible for his crime, no matter how much time is spent from the date of the crime
 europe ke deshon main aparaadh kii tithi se 20 saal ke baad koi abhiyog nahin laayaa ja saktaa
 Criminology is so much concerned with the crime that it tries to understand the criminal
 use pahchaanana isaki paridhi se baahar he
 Its principle is based on the fact that one is defeated by circumstances and leads to crime
 yatha, arth yaa naitik sankat kisi ko duusare kii sampatti kaa apharan karne ko protsaahit kar saktaa he
 Insanity or mental imbalance also promote crime
 at: vaigyanik upachaaron ke prayog se tathaa paristhiti ko anukool kar apradhi ko aparaadh se virat karnaa chahie
 In other words this science supports "correction" in place of "punishment"

 jije 504 bi kanya taramandal ke 59 kanya taare kii parikrama karata hua ek gas daanav grah he
 The mass of this planet found in August 2013 has been estimated about 4 times that of Jupiter in our solar system
 andaaza lagaaya jaataa he ki yadi is grah ko aankhon dwaara sidhaa dekha ja saktaa to iskaa rang gadha gulabi prathit hota
 The 59 Virgo star is the main sequence star of the G-series similar to the Sun, and the time GJ 504b was discovered had the lowest mass of planets ever found in planetary circles of sun-like stars

 Unless a scholar is a scholar of ancient Chinese, he was not considered a complete scholar
 koriayan bhashaa apni shishtataa or vinamrata ke liye prasiddh he
 There are many words of courtesy and modesty in this language
 korea ke log abhivadan ke samay "aap shantipurvak aaen", "aap shantipurvak soyen" jaise aadarsuchak shabdon kaa prayog karte hai
 In 1446, King Sejong of Korea made an announcement to simplify the Korean language, stating that the national language of Korea is different from Chinese and has no similarity to Chinese script, so the people of Korea cannot adopt the methods of Chinese language

 Critics may say that there is a difference of land and sky between 'vedic Sanskrit' and 'hindi'
 par dhyaan dene yogya he ki hebrew, roosi, chini, german or tamil aadi jin bhashaaon ko 'bahut puraani' bataaya jaataa he, unke bhi pracheen or vartmaan roopon main jameen-aasmaan kaa antar he; par logon ne un bhashaaon ke naam nahin badale or unke parivartit swaroopon ko 'pracheen', 'madhyakaalin', 'aadhunik' aadi kaha gaya, jabaki 'hindi' ke sandarbh main prayek yug kii bhashaa kaa nayaa naam rakhaa jaataa rahaa
 While considering the prevailing assumptions regarding the origin and development of Hindi language, we have a question of the origin of the Hindi language towards the natural language and Aphrones languages around the tenth century
 apbhransh shabd kii vyutpatti or jain rachanakaaron kii apbhransh kritiyon kaa hindi se sambandh sthapit karne ke liye jo tark or pramaan hindi sahitya ke itihaas granthon main prastut kiye gayi hai un par vichaar karnaa bhi aavashyak he
 Generally, the emergence of Hindi literature is accepted from Prakrit's last apabhramsha-stage
 us samay apbhransh ke kai rup the or unamem saatvin-aathvin shatabdi se hi padya-rachana prarambh ho gayi thi
 The compositions which are found in terms of literature are in the form of Doha and their subjects, religion, policy, preaching etc
 are prominent
 rajashrith kavi or chaaran niti, shringaar, shaury, parakram aadi ke varnan se apni sahitya-ruchi kaa parichay diya karte the
 This creation-tradition continued for many years in Shaurseni Apabhransh or 'prakritabhasabha Hindi'
 puraani apbhransh bhashaa or bolchaal kii deshi bhashaa kaa prayog nirantar badhata gaya
 Vidyapati has called this language as native language, but it is not easy to decide when and in which country the use of the Hindi word for this language started
 haan, itnaa avashya kaha ja saktaa he ki prarambh main hindi shabd kaa prayog videshi musalamaanon ne kiya tha
 By this word he meant 'indian language'
 aarambhik kaal se lekar aadhunik va aaj kii bhashaa main aadhunikottar kaal tak sahitya itihaas lekhakon ke shatadhik naam ginaye ja sakate hai
 The question of transcribing the history of Hindi literature was more important

 Babu Gulab Rai: Understanding History of Hindi Literature hindi sahitya kaa aarambh aathvin shatabdi se mana jaataa he
 This is the time when after the death of Emperor Harsha, many small petty centers were established in the country which used to struggle
 videshi musalamaanon se bhi inaki takkar hoti rahati thi
 Religious areas were disturbed
 in dinon uttar bharat ke anek bhaagon main buddha dharm kaa prachaar tha
 Buddhism developed in many forms, one of which was called Vajrayana
 vajrayani tantric the or siddh kehalaate the
 He propagated his opinion among the public in the lingua franca of that time
 hindi kaa pracheenatam sahitya inhen vajrayani sidhon dwaara tatkaleen lokbhasha puraani hindi main likhaa gaya
 After this comes the time of Nathpanthi Sadhus
 inhone buddha, shankar, tantra, yoga or shaiva maton ke mishran se apana nayaa panth chalaaya jisamen sabhi virgon or varnon ke liye dharm kaa ek saamaanya mat pratipaadit kiya gaya tha
 His many religious works written in popular old Hindi are available
 iske baad jainiyon kii rachanaayen milti hai
 Swayambhu's "pumachariu" or Ramayana is an eighth century work
 baudhon or nathpanthiyon kii rachanaayen muktak or keval dharmik hai par jainiyon kii anek rachanaayen jivan kii saamaanya anubhutiyon se bhi sambhddha hai
 Many of these are anthologies
 isi kaal main abdurrahman kaa kavy "sandeshraasak' bhi likhaa gaya jisamen parvarti bolchaal ke nikat kii bhashaa milti he
 Thus the form of old Hindi continued to be developed and developed till the eleventh century
 gyarahavin sadi ke lagbhag deshbhasha hindi kaa rup adhik sfoot hone laga
 At that time many small Rajput states were established in the Western Hindi Territory
 ye paraspar athwa videshi akramanakariyon se praaia: yuddhrat rahaa karte the
 The royal poetry of the barns and the Bhats which were under the patronage of these kings were named as Veeragatha
 in virgthaon ko raso kaha jaataa he
 In this, besides mentioning the valor and valor of the asylum kings, their love affairs are also mentioned
 raso granthon main sangharsh kaa kaaran praaia: prem dikhaaya gaya he
 There is a mixture of history and imagination in these compositions
 raso virgit or prabandhkavy - in do roopon main likhe gayi
 The available copies of many of these Raso texts may be historically doubtful, but the oral tradition of these heroics is undeserved
 inamen shaury or prem kii ojasvi or saras abhivyakti hui he
 It was during this period that Maithil Kokil Vidyapati got a unique expression of human beauty and love in his poetry
 kirtilata or kirtipataakaa inke do anya prasiddh granth hai
 This is also the time of Amir Khusro
 inhone theth khadi boli main anek paheliyaan, mukariyaan or do sakun rache hai
 The language of their songs, couplets is Braj Bhasha

 vidyapati : kirtilata, kirtipataakaa, vidyapati padaavalee By the thirteenth century, there was a great mess in the field of religion
 janata main sidhon or yogiyon aadi dwaara prachlit andhvishwaas fail rahe
 They were, even in the scholarly class, the orthodoxy and primordiality had taken precedence
 mayawad ke prabhaav se lokavimukhataa or niskriyata ke bhav samaaj main panpane lage the
 At such a time a huge cultural movement took place across India in the form of Bhakti movement, which established the social and personal values that were eminent in the society
 bhakthi andolan kaa aarambh dakshin ke alwar santon dwaara dasvin sadi ke lagbhag hua
 Four Vaishnava sects stood there against Shankaracharya's advaitaism and Mayaism
 in chaaron sampradaayon ne uttar bharat main vishnu ke avtaron kaa prachaarprasar kiya
 One of these was promoted by Ramanujacharya, whose disciple Ramananda preached Rambhakti in North India
 ramanand ke ram brahm ke sthanapann the jo rakshason kaa vinaash or apni lila kaa vistaar karne ke liye sansar main avateern hote hai
 In the field of Bhakti, Ramanand laid special emphasis on eradicating discrimination of high order
 ram ke sagun or nirgun do roopon ko maananevaale do bhakton - kabir or tulsi ko inhone prabhavit kiya
 At the same time Vallabhacharya started his Pushtimarg on the basis of Vishnuswami's Shuddhavaita opinion
 barahavin se solahavin sadi tak puure desh main puranasammat krishnacharitra ke aadhaar par kai sampradaay pratishthit hue, jinamein sabase zyada prabhaavshaalee vallabh kaa pushtimaarg tha
 He called the virtuous form of Brahman as real against Shankarism
 unke mat se yah sansar mithyaa yaa maaya kaa prasar nahin he balki brahm kaa hi prasar he, at: satya he
 He considered Krishna to be an incarnation of Brahma and for his attainment it was necessary that the devotee's complete surrender
 bhagavan ke anugrah yaa pushti ke dwaara hi bhakthi sulabh ho sakati he
 In this sect, the sweet form of Gopijanavallabh, Lilapurushotam Krishna was accepted for worship
 is prakaar uttar bharat main vishnu ke ram or krishna avtaron pratishtha hui
 Thus, on the basis of these different views, two branches of Bhaktikavya in Hindi called Nirgun and Saguna went together
 nirgunamat ke do upavibhag hue - gyanashrayi or premashrayi
 The representatives of the first are Kabir and the second is Jaisi
 sagunmat bhi do upadharaon main pravaahit hua - rambhakti or krishnabhakti
 The first representative is Tulsi and the second is Surdas
 gyanashrayi shakha ke pramukh kavi kabir par taatkaalik vibhinn dharmik pravritiyon or darshanik maton kaa sammilit prabhaav he
 The form of religion reformer and social reformer is special in his works
 unhone aacharan kii shuddhta par bal diya
 He was intensely betrayed by externalities, stereotypes and superstitions
 manushya kii kshamta kaa udghosh kar unhone nimnashrenee kii janata main aatmgaurav kaa bhav jagaaya
 The other poets of this branch are Raidas, Dadu
 premashrayi dhara ke sarvapramukh kavi jaaysi hai jinka "padmavat' apni maarmik premavyanjana, katharas or sahaj kalavinyas ke kaaran vishesh prashansit hua he
 Among his other compositions are "akhrawad 'and" Aakhri Kalam' etc
, which contain Sufi sects
 is dhara ke anya kavi hai qutuban, manzan, usmaan, shaikh nabi or nur mohammad aadi
 From today's point of view, the importance of this entire devotee is more due to the human feelings and emotions of the world than its righteousness
 isi vichaar se bhaktikaal ko hindi kavy kaa swarna yug kaha ja saktaa he
 a new twist in Hindi poetry took place around 1700 AD
 ise visheshat: taatkaalik darbari samskruti or sanskritsahitya se uttejnaa mili
 Certain portions of Sanskrit literature have led him to a classical discipline
 hindi main 'reeti' yaa 'kavyariti' shabd kaa prayog kavyashastra ke liye hua tha
 Therefore, keeping in view the poetic general creation process and the majority of the characteristic signs of rasa, ornamentation, etc
, the poetry of this time is called 'ritikavya'
 is kavy kii shringaari pravritiyon kii puraani parampara ke spasht sanket sanskrit, praakrit, apbhransh, farsi or hindi ke adikavy tathaa krishnakavy kii shringaari pravritiyon main milte hai
 Ritikavya's work was started by a Sanskritist
 ye the acharya keshavadas, jinaki sarvaprasiddh rachanaayen kavipriya, rasikapriya or ramchandrika hai
 Several decades after Keshava, from the Chintamani to the eighteenth century, the Ajastra source of ritualism flowed in Hindi, with a very artistic expression of the delightful aspects of male-female life and the Saras sensibilities of it
 reetikaal ke kavi raajaaon or raison ke aashray main rahete the
 There was a natural atmosphere of entertainment and artistry
 bauddhik anand kaa mukhya saadhan vahaan uktivaichitraya samajha jaataa tha
 Literature written in such an environment was mostly erotic and artistic
 par isi samay prem ke svachhand gayak bhi hue jinhone prem kii gaharaaiyon kaa sparsh kiya he
 Both in terms of quantity and poetry, this period's poetic euphemism of male-female love and beauty is important
 reetikavy mukhyat: maansal shringaar kaa kavy he
 It has a beautiful opening to the memorable aspects of male-female life
 adhik kavy muktak style main he, par prabandhkavy bhi hai
 In these two hundred years, Shringarakavya had an extraordinary rise
 par dhire dhire reeti kii jakad badhati gai or hindi kavy kaa bhavakshetra sankeern hota gaya
 By coming to the modern era, the attention of writers was particularly attracted to these two shortcomings
 inhen bhi dekhen - This is the early period of the modern era when Indians came into contact with European culture
 bharat main apni jaden jamaane ke kaam main angareji shashan ne bhartiya jivan ko vibhinn staron par prabhavit or andolit kiya
 The structure of the situational lifestyle began to break down due to the new circumstances
 ek nae yug kii chetana kaa aarambh hua
 New dimensions of conflict and reconciliation emerged
 naye yug ke sahityasrujan kii sarvocch sambhaavnaayen khadi boli gadhy main nihit thim, isliye ise gadhy-yug bhi kaha gaya he
 Ancient prose of Hindi is found in Rajasthani, Maithili and Brajbhasha but he was unable to become a medium of literature
 khadiboli kii parampara pracheen he
 Examples of this have been scattered in poetry ranging from Amir Khusro to Medieval Bhushan
 khadi boli gadhy ke bhi puraane namoonay mili hai
 a lot of such prose is written in Persian and Gurmukhi script
 dakshin kii musalmaan riyasaton main "dakkhini' ke naam se iskaa vikaas hua
 The prose of Ramprasad Niranjani and Daulatram written in the eighteenth century is available
 par nayi yugachetana ke samvahak rup main hindi ke khadi boli gadhy kaa vyapak prasar unnisvin sadi se hi hua
 At the Fort William College in Calcutta, Lallu Lal and Sadal Mishra, by writing prose books, gave some assistance in the development of the preconceptions of Hindi prose dialect prose, for the use of new English officers
 munshi sadasukhlal or insha allaa khan kii gadhy rachanaayen isi samay likhi gai
 Later, the press, journalists, Christian evangelists and new educational institutions helped in the development of Hindi prose
 bengal, punjab, gujarat aadi vibhinn praanton ke nivaasiyon ne bhi isaki unnati or prasar main yoga diya
 The first Hindi newspaper "udant Martand" was published in 1826 from Calcutta
 raja shivaprasad or raja lakshmana singh hindi gadhy ke nirmaan or prasar main apane apane dhang se sahaayak hue
 Aryasamaj and other cultural movements also carried forward modern prose
 gadhysahitya kii vikasman parampara unnisvin sadi ke uttarardh se agrasar hui
 Its originator was Bharatendu Harishchandra, the pioneer and guide of the modern era, who established a close connection of literature to contemporary life
 yah sankranti or navajagaran kaa yug tha
 The public was upset and angered by the diplomatic tactics and economic exploitation of the British
 samaaj kaa ek varg paashchaatya sanskaron se aakraant ho rahaa tha to doosraa varg roodhiyon main jakadaaa hua tha
 At the same time, new education started and social reform movements took place
 naveen gyaan vigyaan ke prabhaav se navshikshiton main jivan ke prati ek nayaa drushtikon viksit hua jo ateet kii apeksha vartmaan or bhavishya kii ore vishesh unmukh tha
 The faith generated in social development and the awakening community awareness created new enthusiasm for life among Indians
 bhaaratendu ke samakaleen sahitya main visheshat: gadhysahitya main tatkaaleen vaicharik or bhautik parivesh kii vibhinn avasthaaon kii spasht or jivant abhivyakti hui
 The new creations of this era are full of patriotism and social reform
 anek nai paristhitiyon kii takaraahat se raajnneetik or saamaajik vyang kii pravriti bhi udbuddha hui
 The prose of this time has a liveliness of speech
 lekhakon ke vyaktitv se samprukt hone ke kaaran usamen paryaapt rochakata aa gai he
 Most of the essays were written which were also subjective and thoughtful and descriptive
 anek shaileyon main kathasahitya bhi likhaa gaya, adhiktar shikshapradhan
 But the realist vision and uniqueness of the new craft lies in Srinivasa Das's "examination"
 [[devkinandan khatri kaa tilsmi upanyaas 'chandrakanta' isi samay prakashit hua
 a substantial amount of plays and social acts were composed
 bhaaratendu, pratapanarayan mishra, shrinivas das, aadi pramukh naatakkaar hai
 Also many succulent poems of devotion and adornment were also produced
 par jin kavitaaon main saamaajik bhaavon kii abhivyakti hui ve hi naye yug kii srujanshiltaa kaa aarambhik abhas detii hai
 The remaining poems were written in Brajbhasha except for sporadic experiments of Khadi dialect
 vastav main nayaa yug is samay ke gadhy main hi adhik pratifalit ho sakaa
 The most important events of this period are two - one is the acceptance of the standing dialect as a general poetry, and the other is the regulation and refinement of Hindi prose
 is kaary main sarvaadhik shashakt yoga saraswati sampadak mahaviraprasad dvivedi kaa tha
 Dwivedi and his colleagues developed expressiveness of Hindi prose
 niabandh ke kshetra main dvivedi ji ke atirikt balmukund, chandradhar sharma guleri, purnasingh, padmasingh sharma jaise ek se ek saavdhaan, shashakt or jeevant gadhyshaileekar saamne aae
 Many novels were written but his realist tradition could not develop significantly
 yatharthparak aadhunik kahaniyaan isi kaal main janami or vikasman hui
 Apart from Guleri, Kaushik etc
, early stories of Premchand and Prasad also came to light at this time
 naatak kaa kshetra avashya suunaa sa rahaa
 The most influential critic of this time was Dwivedi, whose revisionist and myriad critical criticism influenced many contemporary literature
 mishrabandhu, krishnabihari mishra or padmasingh sharma is samay ke anya sameekshak hai par kul milakar is samay kii samiksha bahyapakshapradhan hi rahi
 Inspired by the reformist ideals, Ayodhyasinh Upadhyaya in his "priyapravasa" introduced Radha's public service and also demonstrated mastery in the use of various forms of Khadiboli
 maithilisharan gupt ne "bharat bharti' main rashtriyata or samajasudhar kaa swar unchaa kiya or "saket' main urmila kii pratishtha kii
 Other poets of this time are Dwivedi ji, Sridhar Pathak, Balamukund Gupta, Nathuram Sharma 'shankar', Gaya Prasad Shukla 'sanehi' etc
 brajabhasha kavyaparampara ke pratinidhi ratnakar or satyanarayan kaviratn hai
 At this time the work of standing dialect was done in accordance with the refinement of poetry and contemporary environment
 nae kavy kaa adhikansh vichaarparak or varnanaatmak he
 In the two decades of 1920–40, many forms of ideological and artistic trends flourished under modern literature
 sarvaadhik lokapriyata upanyaas or kahani ko mili
 In the Kathashakhyatya, living memories were created while living in place of eventuality
 nimna or madhyavargeey samaaj ke yatharthparak chitra vyapak rup main prastut kiye gaye
 Lively styles of narration evolved
 is samay ke sarvapramukh kathakaar premchand hai
 Vrindavanlal Varma's historical novel is also mentioned
 hindi naatak is samay jaishankar prasad ke saath srijan ke naveen str par arohan karata he
 His romantic historical drama became of special importance due to its vibrant characterization, planning and sensitivities to dramatic conflicts
 kai anya naatakkaar bhi sakriy dikhaai pade
 In the field of Hindi criticism, Ramchandra Shukla poignantly inaugurated the subtle conditions and artistic features of Sur, Tulsi and Jayasi and emphasized the social values of literature
 anya aalochak he shri nandadulaare vaajapeyi, da
 nagendra tathaa da
 hajariprasad dvivedi
 This is the era of the development of cinematography in the field of poetry
 purvavarti kavy vastunishth tha, chhayavaadi kavy bhavanishtha he
 There is predominance of individualistic tendencies in it
 sthool varnan vivaran ke sthaan par chhayavaadi kavy main vyakti kii svachhand bhaawanaaon kii kalatmak abhivyakti hui
 Imaginative imagery is more dear to cinematographers than physical fact and object
 unki saundaryachetana vishesh viksit he
 The beauty of nature attracted him special
 vaiyaktik sanvegon kii pramukhataa ke kaaran chhayavaadi kavy mulat: pragitatmak he
 At this time, the expressiveness of the Khadi dialect was uniquely developed
 jaishankar prasad, maakhanlaal, sumitranandan pant, sooryakanth treepathi "niraala', mahadevi, naveen or dinakar chhayavaad ke utkrisht kavi hai
 After 1940, there was a union movement of progressivism, which is socialized, realistic and utilitarian in opposition to the sentimental, aesthetic and imaginative individualism tendencies of Shadowism
 saamaajik vaishamy or vargsangharsh kaa bhav isamen vishesh mukhar hua
 It embraced literature as an instrument of social revolution
 apni upyogetavaadi drushti kii simaaon ke kaaran pragativaadee sahitya, visheshat: kavita main kalatmak utkarsh kii sambhaavnaayen adhik nahin thim, phir bhi usne sahitya ke saamaajik paksh par bal dekar ek nai chetana jaagrath kii
 Shortly after the start of the Progressive Movement, another individualist trend influenced by the new psychology or psychoanalysis was active in the field of literature, which was called experimentalism after 1943
 isi kaa sanshodhit rup vartmaankaleen nai kavita or nai kahaniyaan hai
 In this way, we see that in the Second World War and its later literature, dissatisfaction and disenchantment towards the misery of life, ugliness and anomalies gave rise to two types of tendencies
 ek kaa naam pragativaad he, jo marks ke bhautikwaadi jeevandarshan se prerana lekar chalaa; doosraa prayogwaad he, jisane paramparaagat aadarshon or sansthaaon ke prati apane ansatosh kii teevr pratikriyaaon ko sahitya ke naveen rupagat prayogon ke madhyam se vyakt kiya
 The new psychology had a profound effect on this
 pragativaad se prabhavit kathakaron main yashpal, upendranath ashk, amritlal nagar or nagarjun aadi vishisht hai
 Among the critics are Ram Vilas Sharma, Namwar Singh, Vijaydev Narayan Sahi
 kaviyon main kedarnath agarwal, nagarjun, rangey raghav, shivamangala singh 'suman' aadi ke naam prasiddh hai
 Achabharya Hazariprasad Dwivedi, Vidya Niwas Mishra and Kuberanath Rai earned special fame in this period in the essay mode
 nae manovigyaan se prabhavit prayogon ke liye sachesht kathakaron main agyeya pramukh hai
 Critically affected by psychology are Elachandra Joshi and Jainendra
 in lekhakon ne vyaktiman ke avchetan kaa udghaatan kar nayaa naitik bodh jagaane kaa praytn kiya
 Janendra and Agnayya broke the traditional structure of fiction and made new stylistic experiments
 parvarti lekhakon or kaviyon main vaiyaktik pratikriyaayein adhik prakhar huin
 They are fully integrated with the contemporary environment
 unhone samaaj or sahitya kii manyataon par gaharaa prashnchihn laga diya he
 Apart from expressing helplessness, frustration, resentment etc
 of individual life, they are engaged in exploring new life values on a personal level
