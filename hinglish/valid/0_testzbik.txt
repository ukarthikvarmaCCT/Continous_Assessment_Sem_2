 uddhartan, anya bhautikeechikitsa-prakriyaaon tathaa prakaash-chikitsaaon ke liye unke upyukt vibhaagon ko uchit prabandh hona chahie
 By this, the patient can be freed from the intimate department by giving quick neurosis and there will be more space and time available for the treatment of heterogeneous patients
 aapad-anuvibhag - bahirang vibhaag kaa ek aavashyak ang aapadnuvibhag he
 Employees should be appointed to work non-working 24 hours
 nivasee sarjan, nurse, ardli, balsevak, mehtar aadi itani sankhya main niyukt kiye jaaen ki choubison ghante rogi ko unki seva uplabdh ho sake
 In this department, treatment of concussion will have to be done exclusively
 is kaaran is chikitsa ke liye sab prakaar ke aavashyak upkarnon tathaa aushadhiyon se yah vibhaag susajjit hona chahie
 The life of the patient depends on its readiness and efficiency
 atev yahan ke karmchaaree apane kaary main nipun hon, tathaa sabhi prakaar kii vyavastha yahan ati uttam honi chahie
 Glucose, plasma, blood, thermodynamic devices, stimulant drugs, injections, etc
 should be available in sufficient quantities
 yahan eks-i kaa ek chalayantra bhi hona chahie, jisase asthibhang, asthi or sandhi sambandhi vikrutiyaan phuffus ke ro ga yaa hriday kii dasha dekhakar rog kaa nishchay kiya ja sake
 It is necessary to have complete arrangements for disinfection of instruments and clothing etc
 yadi yah vibhaag kisi shikshasanstha ke adheen ho to vahaan ek vyaakhyaan yaa pradarshan kaa cameraa hona aavashyak he, jo itnaa bada ho ki samast vidhyaarthee vahaan ek saath baith saken
 There should also be separate rooms for the teachers to rest and keep the teaching material and the employees working at night
 saare vibhaag main uddhavan paddati dwaara shodhit honevaale shauchasthaan hone chahie
 Separate separation of such toilet facilities is necessary for employees and patients
 is vibhaag kaa sanghathan karte samay vahaan honevaale kaary, kaaryakartaaon kii sankhya, prayek anuvibhag main chikitsaarthi rogiyon kii sankhya, unki shaareerik aavashyaktaayen tathaa bhavishya main hone vaale anumit vistaar, in sab baton kaa purna dhyaan rakhana aavashyak he
 Everyday experience is that the building which is constructed today becomes inadequate due to workload in a short time
 pehle se hi iskaa vichaar kar lenaa uchit he
 It is clear from what has been said above that a lot of expenditure has to be incurred in the outdoor department
 aadhunik samay main chikitsa kaa siddhant hi yah he ki koi chaahe kitna hi nidhan kyon na ho, use uttam se uttam chikitsa ke aayojanon tathaa oshadhiyon se apni nirdhantaa ke kaaran vanchit na hona pade
 How much money is needed to fulfill this purpose can be easily estimated
 sarkaar, deshpremi or srisampann vyaktiyon kii sahaayta se is uddeshy kii purti asambhav na honi chahie
 In the intimate department, there is a provision of medical treatment by looking at the odd diseases and the condition of the patient
 praant, nagar yaa kshetra kii aavashyaktaaon ore vahaan uplabdh aarthik sahaayta ke anusaar hi chote yaa bade vibhaag banaae jate hai
 Intimate divisions are made, ranging from few patients to thousands of patients
 yah sab paryaapt dhanrashi ore karmchaariyon kii uplabdhi par nirbhar he
 Many times funds are not available, but suitable employees are not available
 hamaare desh or uttar pradesh main upachaarikaon kii itani kami he ki kitne hi aspataal khaali pade hai
 The reason for this is the disinterest in the treatment system of middle-class families
 kuch saamaajik kaarnon se upachaarikaon ko bahut acchhee drushti se nahin dekha jaataa; yah nitant bhramamoolak he
 There is no justification in such perceptions of the public
 antarang vibhaag main bhartee kiye jane ke pashchaat rogi kii vyavasthaaon kaa purna anveshan visheshgy apane sahaayakon tathaa vyaadhiki prayogshaala, eks-re vibhaag aadi ke sahyog se karata he
 For this reason, it is necessary to keep these departments equipped with the latest equipment
 shalya vibhaag ke liye iskaa mahatv vishesh rup se adhik he jahaan karmchaariyon kaa daksh hona or unamem parsparik sahyog safalataa ke liye anivaary he
 Everyone needs support from the room to the child servant to the specialist surgeon
 keval ek nurse kii asaavadhaanee se sara shastrkarm asafal ho saktaa he
 X-rays and best operation theater are the most essential parts of this department
 utam upachaar sari sanstha kii safalataa kii kunjee he; isi se aspataal kaa naam yaa badanaami hoti he
 Hospitals are the most important part of modern medicine
 is kaaran uttam shikshit upachaarikaon ko taiyaar karne kii aayojana sarkaar kii ore se kii gai he
 The construction of modern hospitals has become a specialized art of engineering
 aspataalon ke nirmaan ke liye rajya ke medical vibhaag ne adarsh maanchitr bana die hai, jinamein aspataal kii vishesh aavashyaktaaon or suvidhaon kaa dhyaan rakhaa gaya he
 Appropriate maps have been prepared for all types of small and big hospitals according to which the required expansion hospitals can be built
 aspataal banane ke purv yah bhalee-bhanti samaj lenaa uchit he ki aspataal kharch karanevaali sanstha he, dhanoparjan karanevaali nahin
 a large amount of money is needed initially to build a modern hospital; The cost of running him regularly is a bigger question
 bina iskaa prabandh kiye aspataal bananaa bhul he
 Due to lack of funds, there is a lot of difficulty going forward and the following objectives of the hospital cannot be fulfilled: natvahan kaamaye raajyan na swarg napunarbhavam
 Kamae dushkaptanam pranamamartinashanam
 
 Our country is very wide and its population is very large
 usee prakaar yahan chikitsa sambandhi prashn bhi utane hi vistrut or jatil hai
 Then the poverty of the people and lack of education makes this question even more complicated
 is kaaran chikitsaprabandh kii aavashyaktaaon ke adhyayan ke liye sarkaar kii ore se kai baar cametiyaan niyukt kii gai hai
 According to the recommendations made by the Bhor committee, there should be a hospital with 75 doctors for every 10 to 12 thousand population, with six doctors and six doctors and other staff
 yah praathmik ang kehalaayegaa
 a secondary organ is also required on 20 such primary organs
 yahan ke aspataal main 1,000 antarang rogiyon ko rakhane kaa prabandh ho
 Here specialists of every medical branch should be appointed and the hostesses and other staff should also be there
 eks-re, rajyakshma, surgery, chikitsa, vyaadhiki, prasuti, asthichikitsa aadi sab vibhaag pruthak-pruthak hon
 Beyond the secondary organs and larger, be it the department or organ of the central or district, where all types of therapies are arranged, which are not managed in the secondary lead hospital
 yahi par sabase bade sanchaalak kaa bhi sthaan ho
 The entire permitted expenditure of this event is more than the total income of the Government of India
 is kaaran yah yojana abhi tak karyanvit nahin ho saki he
 Nowadays, due to increase in population and number of patients accordingly, construction of special type of hospitals has become necessary
 pratham aavashyaktaa chhutahe rogon ke pruthak aspataal banane kii hoti he, jahaan keval chhutahe rogi rakhe jate hai
 Similarly, a separate hospital is necessary for Rajakshma patients
 maansik rog, asthirog, ballrog, streerog, prasutigrih, viklaangata aadi ke liye bade nagaron main pruthak aspataal aavashyak hai
 It is necessary to create at least different required departments in the same hospital in small towns
 in aspataalon kaa nirmaan bhi unke aavashyaktaanusaar bhinn-bhinn prakaar se karnaa hota he or usee prakaar vahaan ke karmchaariyon kii niyukti kii jaati hai
 The government has prepared a map of all these types of hospitals and a list of all the requirements there, according to which all types of hospitals can be built
 bade nagaron main, jahaan aspataalon kii sadaa kami rahati he, ugr avasthaa se mukt hone ke pashchaat, durbal swasthonmukh vyaktiyon tathaa atyadhik samaysadhay chikitsawale rogiyon ke liye pruthak vibhaag-rugnalay -bananaa aavashyak he
 This reduces a lot of the difficulty of the hospitals and makes it easy to find places to keep patients of old age
 aajkal samajaseva chikitsa kaa ek ang ban gai he or dinon-din chikitsaalay tathaa chikitsa main samajasevi kaa mahatv badhata ja rahaa he
 In addition to medicine, it is the job of a philanthropist to study the mental, family and social conditions of the patient and to overcome the patient's attentive difficulties
 rogi kii rogotpati main uski rugnavastha main uske kutumb ko kin kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa pad rahaa he tathaa rog se yaa aspataal se rogi ke mukt ho jane ke pashchaat koun-si kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padegaa, unka rogi par kya prabhaav hoga aadi rogi ke sambandh kii ye sab baaten samajasevi ke adhyayan or upachaar ke vishay hai
 If, after getting rid of the disease, the person is unable to cultivate family due to financial problems, then he can become diseased again
 rogkaal main uske kutumb kii aarthik samasya kaise hal ho, iskaa prabandh samajasevi kaa kartavya he
 Every kind of problem a social worker has to solve
 isse samajasevi kaa chikitsa main mahatv samajha ja saktaa he
 As much as the treatment or treatment is needed in the event of severe disease, after immunization, social service is equally important in protecting the health of the person and making life useful
 ayurvaigyanik shikshasansthaaon main aspataal-ayurvaigyanik shiksha sansthaaon main chikitsaalayon kaa mukhya prayojan vidhyaarthiyon kii chikitsa-sambandhi shiksha tathaa anveshan he
 For this reason, the principles of construction of such hospitals are somewhat different
 inamen prayek vishay kii shiksha ke liye bhinn-bhinn vibhaag hote hai
 In these, according to the number of students, proper place is required to keep patients, in which necessary beds can be kept
 saath hi shayyaon ke bich itnaa sthaan chhodana padataa he ki shikshak or uske vidhyaarthee rogi ke paas khadey hokar uski parriksha kar saken tathaa shikshak rogi ke lakshanon kaa pradarshan or vivechan kar sake
 For this reason more space is required for such hospitals
 phir, prayek vibhaag ko purnataya aadhunik yantron, upkarnon aadi se susajjit karnaa hota he
 They are essential for education
 atev aise chikitsaalayon ke nirmaan or saganthan main saadhaaran aspataalon kii apeksha bahut adhik vyay hota he
 Teachers and staff are also appointed only among the best scholars, who are recognized persons of their subjects
 atev aise chikitsaalay chalaane kaa nityprati kaa vyay adhik hona swaabhaavik aisi sansthaaon ke nirmaan, sajja tathaa karmchaariyon kaa puraa byoraa indian medical council ne taiyaar kar diya he
 This council controls the educational institutions across the country
 jo sanstha uske dwaara nirdhaarit maapdand tak nahin pahunchati usko council manyata pradaan nahin karti or vahaan ke vidhyaarthiyon ko ucch parikshaon main baithne ke adhikaar se vanchit rahanaa padataa he
 This council has done a lot of work in raising the standard of education
 aise aspataalon main vishesh prashn paryaapt sthaan kaa hota he
 Both the size and the number of rooms have to be kept high
 phir, prayek vibhaag kii aavashyaktaa, vidhyaarthiyon or shikshakon kii sankhya aadi kaa dhyaan rakhkar chikitsaalay kii yojana taiyaar kerani padati he

 According to the Mandsaur inscription, he had not bowed his head to anyone other than Lord Stashma before the war with Yashodharman

 He says that once Mihirkul expressed the desire of Buddhist monks to know about Buddhism
 But the Buddhist monks insulted him, instead of sending a senior Buddhist monk to him, he sent a servant as a Buddhist Guru
 When Mihirkul came to know about this, he became enraged and he issued a decree for the destruction of Buddhism
 He broke all the Buddhist monasteries of North India and made the monks slaughtered
 According to Hensang, Mihirkul erased the names of Buddhists from North India

 Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates such as the Antarctic
 In fact, some species of penguins now live only a few south

 sabase choti prajati little blue penguin, feiri penguin ke naam se bhi jaani jaati he, kii unchai lagbhag 40 semi or vajan 1 kilogram hota he
 Among the present-day penguins, larger penguins live in colder regions, while smaller penguins are also commonly found in temperate or tropical climates
 Some prehistoric species were as tall and weighed in size as an adult human
 This species was not limited to the Antarctic regions; Rather, the Antarctic subcontinent was more diverse in the regions, and at least one giant penguin has been found in an area not far from 35 to 2000 km south of the equator and where the climate is warmer than it is today
 "penguin" shabd kii vyutpatti atyaadhik vivaadit he
 The English word is apparently not of French nor of Breton or of Spanish origin, but the first appears to be of English or Dutch language

 An alternative etymology is found in English dictionaries, which link the word to the Latin language pinguis "fat", because of its perceived shape
 yah vyutpatti asambhav hogi yadi "penguin" ko "multah" great ouk ke liye prayukt kiya jaataa tha, jaisaa ki kuch sutron kaa kahana he
 a third theory suggests that the term is a changed form of "pen-wing", with reference to the rudimentary wings of both the penguin and the Great Oak

 Given that neither the relationship of penguins to subfamilies nor the location of penguins in avian phylogeny is yet to be understood, this seems fake and somehow confusing; Hence the Linnean system established here is explained

 Some articles about the prehistory of penguins have been published since 2005, it is believed that the development of the current generation is now understood

 In the absence of direct evidence, it may be said that by the end of the Cretaceous, penguin lineages had developed differently, although not as contiguous as they are today; It is quite likely that they were not completely flightless at that time, as birds unable to fly are generally very small, leading to their initial phase of mass extinction due to low capacity

 It is not yet known whether giant Palaeudyptinae represents monophyletic generation, or whether giantia emerged separately in Palaeudyptinae and Anthroporinithinae - whether they were validated, or whether Palaeudyptinae contained a large range that was demarcated as generally Including nowadays
 Ancient and well-described giant penguins, the 5-foot-high Icadyptes salasi as far north as in northern Peru, were found 36 mya ago
 kisi bhi maamle main, peleogin ke ant main, 25 mya ke aasapaas, vishaal penguin gaayab ho gayi the
 The reason for their decline and extinction was the spread of the species that feed them, Skulodontoidea and other primitive, fish-eating toothed whales, which of course struggled to eat them and eventually succeeded
 a new lineage, the Paraptenoidites, which includes short but decidedly stout legs, had already been born in South America by that time

 "as an early species, the Pygoscelis seem to have perished during the Bertonian era, but the main cause of the diversity today is range expansion and radiation, the early Miocene up to that time, about 20–15 mya ago, from the Bardigalian phase

 The emergence of the Antarctic subcontinent lineage at the end of the Bertonian coincided with the slow onset of the cooling period which eventually lasted some 3
5 million ice ages
 The main reason for the decline of habitat by the Priabonians on the Antarctic is due to the more favorable conditions in the Antarctic subfields than in the Antarctic
 Notably, the cold Antarctic Pole-like continuous current began only around 30 mya, cooling the Antarctic on the one hand and spreading Spheniscus to South America and eventually beyond

 Later, a mild summer period was ended by climate change of the Middle Miocene, a sharp drop in global average temperature by 14–12 mya, and some similar cold events occurred between 8 mya and 4 mya; By the end of the Tortonian, the Antarctic ice sheet was somewhat similar in extension and extent to what it is today

 isaki lambaai kii vajah se, pratikriya swaroop bharat sarkaar dwaara adhinium 1935 ko ko do alag-alag adhiniyamon main vibhajit kiya gaya: In literature on Indian political and constitutional history, the reference is generally taken to be a shortened form of the Government of India 1935 Act, rather than being enacted originally as a text of the Act
 adhinium ke sabase mahatvapurn pahalu the: However, the degree of autonomy the introduction of the provincial level was subject to significant limitations: the provincial governor retained significant reserve powers and the British authorities also retained the authority to suspend a responsible government

 unnisvin sadi ke uttarardh ke baad se bhartiya logon ne apane desh kii sarkaar main lagaataar badi bhoomika kii maang kii
 The contribution of Indians to the British war effort during World War i meant that the more conservative elements of the British political establishment felt the need for constitutional change and the resulting 1919 Act of the Government of India
 The act introduced a neo system of government known as the provincial "dyarchy", that is, the government of some regions was placed in the hands of ministers responsible for the provincial legislature while others were appointed by the British-appointed provincial governor
 Were held in the hands of the officials responsible for
 jabaki adhinium, bharatiyon dwaara sarkaar main ek badi bhoomika nibhaane kii maang kaa ek pratibimb tha, saath hi bharat kii vyavastha main us bhoomika kaa kya matlab ho saktaa he iske bare main british bhay kaa ek pratibimb tha
 Experiments with dyarchy proved unsatisfactory

 It was intended to review India's constitutional arrangements and those princely states that were ready to accept it
 haalanki, samjhaute ko rokane ke liye congress or muslim pratinidhiyon ke bich vibhaajan karnaa mukhya kaarak sabit hua chunki vyavastha main sangh ke kaam karne kii mahatvapurn jaankaree thi
 Against the system, the new Conservative-dominated national government in London decided to come forward with the drafting of its own proposal
 lord linlithgo kii adhyakshata main ek sanyukt sansadeey chayan samiti ne kaaphi had tak white paper kii samiksha kii
 On the basis of this white paper, the Government of India bill was created
 cameti str or baad main kattarta ko shant kiya gaya, "suraksha" ko majboot kiya gaya or kendriya vidhansabha ke liye apratyaksh chunaav kaa punah aayojan kiya gaya
 The bill was duly passed into law in August 1935
 is prakriya kaa ek parinaam yah he ki, haalanki bhartiya maangon ko puraa karne ke liye bharat sarkaar ke 1935 kii adhinium ko thodaa or aage janaa chahie tha, iskaa masauda saamagree main bill kaa bistaar or bhartiya bhagidaari kii kami donon kaa arth tha ki bharat main sarvshereshth nirutsaah pratikriya ke saath adhinium kaa hona jabaki britain main ek mahatvapurn tatv ke liye yah kattarpanthi sabit hui
 Although it became unusual for the Acts of the British Parliament to include the Preamble, the lack of one from the Government of India Act 1935 contrasted with the Act of 1919, which led to the purpose of that Act relating to it for Indian political development
 Established a comprehensive philosophy
 20 agast 1917 ko house of comons ke liye bharat mantri edwin montagu ke vaktavy par aadhaarit 1919 ke adhinium kii prastaavna uddhrut he, jo vaada karti he: 


 is a gradual development of self-governing institution with a philosophy for the progressive presentation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire
 canada or australia jaise maujuuda dominian ke saath bhartiya maangon main ab british bharat main sanvaidhanik samta ko praapt karnaa tha jiskaa arth tha ki british rashtramandal main sampoorn swaittata
 An important element in the British political circle doubted that Indians were able to run their country on this basis and with sufficient "security", perhaps, the Dominion status as an objective after a long period of gradual constitutional development saw
 unke bich yah tanaav or bhartiya or british ke bheetar drushti ke parinamswaroop 1935 adhinium ke besanga samjhaute ko paaya gaya jisamen isaki koi apni prastaavna nahin thi, lekin 1919 adhinium kii prastaavna ko isaki jagah rakhaa gaya phir bhi us adhinium ke avshesh ko nirast kiya
 It was generally seen in India as more mixed messages from the British, suggesting a defiant attitude on its part and the barest of "minimum essentials" towards satisfying Indian desires
 sabase aadhunik samvidhanon ke vipareet, lekin us samay ke rashtramandal sanvaidhanik kanoon ke saath saamaanya, adhinium ne "adhikaar ke bill" ko nae pranali ke bheetar shaamil nahin kiya jisaki sthapana kaa uddeshy tha
 However, in the proposed case of the Union of India there were some complications involving a set of rights, as the new entity included nominal sovereign princely states
 haalanki kuch logon dwaara ek alag drushtikon ko mana gaya or nehru report main masauda ruparekha samvidhan main bill ke adhikaar ko shaamil kiya gaya
 In 1947, a relatively few amendments to the Act made the Interim Implementation Constitution of India and Pakistan
 adhinium keval atyant vistrut hi nahin tha, lekin yah 'suraksha maanak' ke saath ghira tha, british jimmedaariyon or hiton ko banaae rakhane ke liye jab bhi isaki aavashyaktaa hoti hastkshep karne ke liye british sarkaar ko sakasham banane ke liye dizin kiya gaya tha
 To meet this goal, the Indian government's institutions are gradually increasing in the face of Indianisation, the decision to use the Act and the actual administration of the security measures in the hands of the British appointed Viceroy and the Provincial Governors who are the Secretary of State for India Was under control
 'vishaal shaktiyon or jimmedaariyon jise governor general apane vivek yaa apane vyaktigat nirnay ke anusaar anushaasan karnaa chahie, yah spasht he ki uske ko superman kii tarah ho jane kii ummid hoti he
 He must be endowed with an infinite capacity for humility, courage and hard work

 " yah bhaashan drudh torij ke drushtakon ko pratibimbit karti he jo ek din lebar government dwaara viceroy kii niyukti hone kii sambhaavna dwaara bhaybheet tha
 a proper reading of the Act shows that the British Government has prepared it for itself, whenever they feel they could take full control of it at any time with the legal tools

 But there is a lack of reality, as the case lacks the necessary powers in defense and foreign affairs, the Governor General is necessarily given a threshold for ministerial activity and the measure of representation of Indian states is negative and even That there is no possibility of the introduction of democratic control

 Those who are not used to any constitution cannot realize what great powers they have to use
 yadi aap is samvidhan ko dekhenge to aisa lagegaa ki sabhi shaktiyaan governor general or rajyapal main nihit he
 But here the whole power is not vested in the king? Everything is done in the name of the king, but does the king ever interfere in it? Once power falls into the hands of the legislature, the governor or the governor general never intervene

 The impropriety of this arrangement is evident when the status of British capital in an Indian modern region is given greater prominence and total dominance, the impropriety is maintained through the commercial system, the UK in both India's international and coastal shipping traffic Removal of shipping interests and Indian capital in the UK without value and Indians in shipping within the UK Sector is the non-existence

 The Pirates of the Seas is a series of thrilling films directed by Gore Verbinski, written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rozio and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer
 ve usee naam ke ek walt dijani theme park sawari par aadhaarit hai or captain jaik spairo, vil turnar or elizabeth swaan kaa anusaran karte hai
 The films debuted on the big screen in 2003 with their first release of Samudar's Robbers: The Curse of the Black Pearl
 Following the unexpected success of the first film, Walt Disney Pictures reported that a composition triad was in the works
 samundar ke lutere: murde kaa khazaana teen saal baad 2006 main jari kii gai
 Its answer story proved to be very successful, breaking records worldwide on the day of its premiere
 In the end it grossed a total of $ 1,066,179,725 at the worldwide box office, becoming the fourth and fastest film to reach this amount
 The third film of the series, Samundar Ke Lootere: Last Watch was released in 2007

 1990 ke dashak ke aarambh ke dauraan, patakatha lekhak ted iliyat va terry rozio ne pyrets of da carabian sawari par aadhaarit ek film likhane ke bare main sochaa
 Disney asked Jay Wolpert to write a ride-based script, which producer Jerry Bruckheimer rejected, thinking it was "an accurate pirate film"
 Because of the information about their piracy, Stuart Biatti was brought in to rewrite the script in March 2002, and Elliot and Rozio later that same month
 iliyat va rozio pyrets of da carabian theme park sawari ke shuruuaati varnan se prerit ho gaye or unhone film ko ek alokik sira dene kaa nirnay kar liya
 As the budget went up, Michael Eisner and Robert Iger threatened to cancel the film, though Bruchheimer changed his mind by showing concept art and animation

 Verbinski was attracted to the idea of using modern technology, which was being used to revive the style that had disappeared after the Hollywood golden era, and he remembered his childhood memories of riding, he felt That the film was an occasion to pay tribute to its "scary and funny" tone
 dep is kahani se aakarshith hue kyonki unhen yah vicitra lagi: khazaana khojane kii koshish karne ke bajaay, blike parl kaa dal apana shraap hataane ke liye use waapas karne kii koshish kar rahaa tha; or paramparaagat vidroh bhi pehle hi ho chukaa tha
 Verbinski approached Rush for the role of Barbossa, as he knew that he would play it not with an effort to complicate but with a simple villain that suited the tone of the story
 Orlando Bloom read the script after suggesting Rush, with whom he was working on Ned Kelly
 Keira Knightley came as a surprise to Verbinski: she had not seen her performance in Bend It Like Beckham and was impressed with her audition
 There were talks with Tom Wilkinson to play Swan Governor, but the role was passed on to Jonathan Price, who Depp considered his role model
 da kars of da blike parl kii shooting 9 oktober 2002 ko shuru hui or march 2003 tak purna ho gai
 Prior to its release, many anticipated the film to be a complete failure, as the pirate genre had not been successful for many years, the film was based on a theme park ride and Johnny Depp rarely made a major film
 parantu da kars of da blike parl aalochanatmak or vyavsaayik donon tarah se safal rahi
 Seeing the performance of the film, the cast and crew signed on for two more follow-on stories, which were to be made back-and-forth, an actionable decision from Disney to work with the same actor class and crew

 Maria Montessori was a physician and educationist from Italy, by whose name the Montessori system of education is famous
 unki shikshapaddati aaj bhi kuch vidyalayon main prachlit he
 Montessori was born in a small town in Italy to Dr
 Maria, the originator of the Montessori education system and a great proponent of child needs and rights
 inke janm ke thode samay baad hin inke mata-pita rome chale aae jahaan inaki shiksha prarambh hui
 In 1894, she was the first woman in Rome to receive a doctorate after completing the education of the University of Rome, medicine

 The Education Minister of Rome invited him to give more lectures and then assigned the responsibility of preparing teachers for the mentally retarded children
 yah avasar paakar maantesri ne swayan mandabuddhi baalkon kii chikitsa kaa kaam prarambh kiya or unpar shaikshik prayog bhi kiye
 While doing this, he turned his attention to the teaching method created by Dr
 Edward Segwyn, a medical psychologist who used to improve such children
 unhone seguin kii shaikshik chikitsa tathaa anya sahitya kaa gahan adhyayan kiya or unke sanchalit skulon ko bhi dekha
 He was also introduced by Segwyn to the literature of Dr
 JMG Itard, who focused on the education of retarded children during the French Revolution
 in donon doctoron ke shiksha sambandhi vichaaron se maantesri ne laabh uthaaya or unke aadhaar par apni shikshanvidhi kaa vikaas kiya
 In this way, while working for the treatment and education of the retarded children in Rome, Dr
 Montessori began to believe that if such scientific education is used on the children of common sense, then they should benefit more

 Where in socialism, the distribution of duty and authority is regularized with the formula of 'each one according to his own ability, each one according to the work', whereas in communism the principle of 'every one according to the right, each according to the need' is applied

 The First World War was an important event for the socialist movement
 jahaan ek ore to iske aarambh hote hi samaajawaadee andolan or unka antarrashtriya sanghathan praaia: chhin-bhinn ho gaya vahiin duusari ore iske bich rus main bolshevik kranti hui or sansar main pratham safal samaajawaadee rajya kii neenv padi jiskaa sansar ke samaajawaadee andolanon par gaharaa asar padaa
 Before the First World War, the socialist parties were of the view that the capitalist system is responsible for the wars and if the world war started then it should be the duty of every socialist party to oppose the war strategy of its capitalist government and try to establish socialism by the civil war
 Ho
 parantu jyon hi yuddh aarambh hua, rus or italy ke samaajawaadee dalon ko chhodkar shesh sab dalon ke bahumat ne apni sarkaron kii niti kaa samarthan kiya
 Only a negligible minority of socialists opposed the war, and some of these later became supporters of Vladimir Lenin and his communist international organization
 parantu vibhinn deshon ke samaajawaadee andolanon kii paraspar virdohi yudhniti ke kaaran unka aikya khatm ho gaya
 The Bolshevik party was one of several socialist parties in Russia
 1917 kii vishesh paristhitiyon main isko safalataa praapt hui
 The background of Russian socialism was different from the situation in other European socialisms
 roosi samrajya europe ke agrani deshon se udyog dhandhon main pichhadaa hua tha, at: yahan majdoor varg bahusankhyak or adhik prabhaavshaalee na ho sakaa
 There was also a lack of democratic governance and individual freedoms
 roosi buddhijivi or madhyamvarg inke liye icchhuk tha par jaarshahi damanniti ke kaaran inaki prapti kaa sanvaidhanik maarg avaruddhapraay tha
 Influenced by these circumstances, the first socialists there considered the rural commune of Russia as the basis of their ideas and considered the first step to the success of democraticism by destroying the Tsar by revolutionary path
 un vichaarkon main harjen, lavarove, charnishevski or baakunin mukhya hai
 Influenced by these, many intellectuals headed towards the revolution
 is prakaar narodanik jan andolan kii neenv padi tathaa narodanya volya sanghathan bana
 In 1901, it was named Social Revolutionary Party
 san 1917 kii bolshevik kranti ke samay tak yah rus kaa sabase bada samaajawaadee dal tha, parantu iskaa prabhavakshetra adhikanshat: gramin janata thi
 Its left side supported the Bolshevik revolution
 duusari samaajawaadee vichaardhaara, jisamen bolshevik dal bhi sammilit tha, roosi saamaajik janavaadee majdoor party ke naam se prasiddh he
 Its influence was mainly in the civilian working class
 rus main udyog kam the, parantu bade paimaane ke the or apekshaya adhik mazdooron ko naukar rakhte the
 Hence there was more political consciousness and organization among these laborers
 loktantr ke abhaav main mazdooron kaa sangharsh karnaa kathin tha, isliye majdoor varg krantikari prabhaav main aa gaya or germany jaisi paristhitiyon ke kaaran yahan ke adhikansh majdoor netaa bhi marxvaadi tathaa germany ke saamaajik loktantrvaadi dal se prabhavit hue
 Around 1890 Axelrod and Plekhanov established the first working group in Petersburg which later became the basis of the Russian Social Democratic Workers Party in 1898
 roosi saamaajik loktantrvaadi majdoor party ke netaa kattar marxvaadi the, at: unhone punraritivaad ko asweekaar kiya or marxvad ko viksit kar roosi paristhitiyon main lagu kiya
 The level of living of the workers had improved, it was difficult not to believe this truth, but Plekhanov proved that the rate of capitalist exploitation is increasing due to the use of new machines and the expected increase in wages
 bukharin kaa tark tha ki samrajyavaadee desh upniveshon ke shoshan dwaara apane shramjivi varg ko santusht rakh pate hai
 Trotsky etc
 said that the crisis of the capitalist has become ubiquitous and in this situation it is possible that the revolution should not be in the leading countries of Western Europe but in the relatively backward countries, where the communist link is the weakest
 kuch vichaarkon ne sarvapratham samaajawaadee kranti kaa sthaan rus ko batalaaya
 Trotsky and Lenin opined that socialist revolution can succeed at the same time that it is difficult to establish socialism in only one country without a permanent revolution spread across several countries
 baad main lenin or stallin ne is siddhant main sanshodhan kar ekadeshiy samaajwaad ke aadhaar par soviet satta kaa nirmaan kiya
 Nikolai Lenin coordinated the above ideas and led the organization of the Bolshevik Party and the October Revolution
 san 1903 kii landan conference main roosi saamaajik loktantrvaadi majdoor dal ne apane samaajawaadee adarsh ko spasht kiya, parantu isi varg dal ke andar do vichaardhaaraen saamne ain or kalantar main unhone do dalon kaa rup dhaaran kiya
 In this conference, the nationalization of the means of production, the abolition of zamindari, the right to self-build the colonies, the revolutionary path to attain the goal and the dictatorship of the proletariat after the revolution - this policy was accepted, but there were differences in the leaders regarding the organization of the party Gone
 prashn tha ki dal kii sadsyta keval kaaryakartaaon tak simit ho athwa aadarshon ko sweekaar karanevaala prayek vyakti uskaa adhikari ho or kya kendriya samiti ko dal kii shakhaon ke bhang karne or unke sthaan main nai shakhaon kii niyukti karne kaa adhikaar ho? lenin ek faujee anushaasanwale suvyavasthit dal ke paksh main tha or conference main uskaa bahumat tha, at: is dhara kaa naam bolshevik padaa or duusari dhara menshevik kahalaai
 Later on, more differences emerged between these parties
 menshavik dal pehle jaarshahi kaa ant kaa poonjeewaadi loktantratmak kranti karnaa chahta tha or is kranti main vah poonjeewaadi dalon ke vam paksh se sahyog karnaa chahta tha, parantu 1905 kii kranti ke baad lenin uske saathi is nishkarsh par pahunche ki samaajawaadee kranti ke bhay ke kaaran poonjeevaad pratikriyaavaadi ho gaya he, at: vah poonjeewaadi loktantratmak kranti kaa netritv karne main bhi asamarth he
 Therefore, only the proletariat can lead this revolution and it is possible to combine this revolution with the proletarian revolution and establish socialism immediately after the monarchy
 kranti main kisaanon kaa sahyog praapt karne ke liye lenin samantvaadi jameen ko kisaanon main baantne ke paksh main tha, menshavik uskaa turant samajikaran karnaa chaahate the
 The Bolshevik Party opposed the First World War and gave the slogan of civil war to establish socialism
 yuddh se trast janata or visheshkar roosi sainikon ne is niti kaa swaagat kiya, parantu menshavikon ne yuddh kaa virodh nahin kiya or farvari march kii kranti ke baad unhone sarkaar main shaamil hokar yuddh jari rakhaa
 Lenin's ideas and Bolshevik organization prevailed in the October Revolution of 1917

 17 varshiya rohan apane teen dosto vikram, binoy or manindar ke saath ek balig film dekhte hue apane warden dwaara pakade jate hai
 | All four of them are expelled from the prestigious Bishop Cotton School, Shimla
 rohan ko na chaahate hue bhi apane ghar jamshedpur lautnaa padataa he
 He has to live there with an angry father
 ve use zindagi apni tarah jeene ko kahte hai
 Every morning, he has to visit the whole city even without wanting to, ready to work in his father's factory and in the evening has to go to college to study engineering
 yah sab karne ke baad bhi use apane pita se shaareerik shoshan or nirantar apmaan hi miltaa he
 Rohan wants to become a writer but his father has no meaning with his dreams
 maan baap ke pyaar se marhoom rohan baahar uski talash karne lagata he
 One day Rohan takes his father's car outside the house and goes to a bar
 vahaan uski mulaakaat apane kalege ke kuch senior se hoti he jo uske dost ban jate hai
 They drink liquor and cigarettes together
 in sabhi chizo me mazaa paakar yah rohan kii niyamit aadat ban jaati he | isi bich apane lekhak banane ke sapane ko puraa karne ke liye rohan jaan boojhkar pariksha me fail ho jaataa he | usee bich uske sautele chote bhai arjuna kii tabiyat kharaab ho jaati he or uske pita ko skool jane ke liye kaha jaataa he | arjuna ke skool jane ke kaaran unke pita ek mahtvapun anubandh kho baithte hai

 Padmabhushan Dr
 Moturi Satyanarayana Award is a literary award given by the Central Hindi Institute under the Ministry of Human Resource Development of India to a scholar of Indian origin who has done remarkable work in the field of Hindi language or literature abroad
 is puraskaar kaa prarambh tamilnadu ke hindi sevi evam vidwaan moturi satyanarayan ke naam par 1989 main hua tha
 The first Padmabhushan Dr
 Moturi Satyanarayana Award was given to Harishankar Order of Canada in the year 2002
 is puraskaar main ek lakh rupee nakad, ek smritichihn, prashasti patr or shawl shaamil hai
 The award is conferred by the President of India himself
 suvyavasthit dhwani, jo ras kii sristi kare, sangeet kehalaati he
 Singing, playing and dancing are all three musicals
 sangeet naam in teenon ke ek saath vyavhaar se padaa he
 Singing, playing and dancing are often as old as old men
 bajaane or baaje kii kala aadmi ne kuch baad main khoji-sikhi ho, par gane or naachne kaa aarambh to na keval hazaron balki lakhon varsh pehle usne kar liya hoga, isamen andeh nahin
 Anthem is almost as natural to human as speech
 kab se manushya ne gaanaa prarambh kiya, yah batalaana utana hi kathin he jitna ki kab se usne bolnaa prarambh kiya
 But after a long time, his anthem took shape
 jab swar or lay vyavasthit rup dhaaran karte hai tab ek kala kaa pradurbhaav hota he or is kala ko sangeet, mujeec yaa mausiiki kehete hai
 Humans have been using the playing of songs during war, festivities and prayers or bhajans
 sansar main sabhi jatiyon main baansuri ityadi phunk ke vaadya, kuch taar yaa taant ke vaadya, kuch chamade se madhe hue vaadya, kuch thonkkar bajaane ke vaadya milte hai
 It seems that till the time of Bharata in India, the anthem was earlier only called 'geet'
 vaadya main jahaan geet nahin hota tha, keval daada, diddid jaise shushk akshar hote the, vahaan use 'nirgeet' yaa 'bahirgeet' kehete the or nritt athwa nrity kii ek alag kala thi
 But gradually the three songs, instruments and dances became intertwined with the "music" - songs, instruments and dances of the trio
 bharat se baahar anya deshon main keval geet or vaadya ko sangeet main ginate hai; nrity ko ek bhinn kala maanate hai
 In India also, dance is counted in music only because it is accompanied by an equal song or instrument or both
 upar likhaa ja chukaa he ki swar or lay kii kala ko sangeet kehete hai
 Vowel and rhythm are found in both song and instrument, but in dance there is only rhythm, not tone
 ham sangeet ke antargat keval geet or vaadya kii charchaa karenge, kyonki sangeet keval isi arth main anya deshon main bhi vyavahrut hota he
 The primary source of music is natural sounds
 prak sangeet-yug main manushya ke prakruti kii dhvaniyon or unki vishisht lay ko samajhane kii koshish kii
 Not all types of natural sounds can be the basis of music, so an attempt has been made to test the sounds that produce the emotion and to tie them to the rhythm
 prakruti kii ve dhvaniyaan jinhone manushya ke man-mastishk ko sparsh kar ullasit kiya, vahi sabhyataa ke vikaas ke saath sangeet kaa saadhan baniin
 Though thinkers have different opinions
 darshanikon ne naad ke chaar bhaagon para, pashyanti, madhyamaa or vaikhari main se madhyamaa ko sangitopayogi swar kaa aadhaar mana
 Darwin said that animals sound sweet at the time of the rati
 manushya ne jab is prakaar kii dhwani kaa anukaran armbh kiya to sangeet kaa udbhav hua
 Karl Stumpf considered the singularity of sound by humans after the genesis of language to be the origin of vowels
 unnisvin shatee ke uttararddh main bharatendu harishchandr ne kaha ki ‘‘sangeet kii utpatti maanviya samvednaa ke saath hui
 He described music as a set of songs, playing, telling and dancing
 praachya shastron main sangeet kii utpatti ko lekar anek rochak kathaayen hai
 Devraj used to be a singer, player and dancer in Indra's meeting
 gandharv gaate the, apsaraayen nrity karti thim or kinnar vaadya bajaate the
 The song has been predominant in gandharva-kala
 aadi main gaan tha, vaadya kaa nirmaan peeche hua
 The song was a staple
 yahi kaaran he ki chaahe geet ho, chaahe vaadya sabakaa naam sangeet pad gaya
 Dance from behind also took its form
 sansar kii jitani arya bhashaayen hai unamem sangeet shabd achche prakaar se gane ke arth main miltaa he
 The word 'music' is made of metal
 anya bhashaaon main ‘san’ kaa ‘sin’ ho gaya he or ‘gai’ yaa ‘ga’ dhaatu kisi na kisi rup main isi arth main anya bhashaaon main bhi vartmaan he
 In anglo-saxon it is translated 'singan' which has become 'sing' in modern English, in Icelandic it is 'sig', in Danish it is 'sing', in Dutch it is 'sing', in Dutch it is 'tsingen', in German it is 'singen' 
 arabi main ‘gana’ shabd he jo ‘gaan’ se purnatah miltaa he
 In the first 'sangitaratnakar' text, the combination of singing, playing and dancing is called 'sangeet'
 vastutah ‘geet’ shabd main ‘sam’ jodakar ‘sangeet’ shabd bana, jiskaa arth he ‘gaan sahit’
 The anthem performed with dance and playing is 'sangeet'
 shastron main sangeet ko sadhana bhi mana gaya he
 Authentically, the remains of most ancient civilizations, statues, postures and frescoes reveal that people were familiar with music thousands of years ago
 dev-devi ko sangeet kaa aadi prerak sirf hamaare hi desh main nahin mana jaataa, europe main bhi yah vishwaas rahaa he
 The mystery is revealed by paying attention to the words for music in Europe, Arabia and Persia
 sangeet ke liye unani bhashaa main shabd ‘mausiki’, latin main ‘musika’, francisi main ‘musik’, portugi main ‘musika’, german main moosik’, angreji main ‘mujeec’, ibrani, arabi or farsi main ‘mosiki’
 All these words are equitable
 ye sabhi shabd unani bhashaa ke ‘mus’ shabd se bane hai
 'muse' is considered the goddess of poetry and music in the Greek tradition
 kosh main ‘mus’ shabd kaa arth diya he ‘di insapiring godes of saang’ arthath ‘gaan kii prerica devi’
 In the Greek tradition, 'muse' is considered the daughter of "jyaus"
 jyos’ shabd sanskrit ke ‘dyus’ kaa hi roopaantar he jiskaa arth he ‘swarg’
 The conception of 'jyaus' and 'muse' is very similar to Brahma and Saraswati
 bhartiya sangeet kaa janm veda ke uccharan main dekha ja saktaa he
 The oldest book of music is the Natyashastra of Bharata Muni
 anya granth hai: brihaddeshi, dattilam, sangitaratnakar
 Music is very important for us
 or yah hamaari dainik jindagi kaa hissaa ban chukaa he
 Music is not only heard for entertainment
 varan iske kai saare phaayde hai
 Now scientists are also using music inside the treatment of many diseases
 anek vaigyanik research ne is baat ko pramanit kiya he ki sangeet sunne se kai saare maansik phaayde hote hai
 Nowadays every human's life race is full of sunshine
 kaam karte karte ham buree tarah se thak jate hai
 When listening to music, our brain gets into the Relax mode
 hamaare dimag me nai energy kaa sanchaar hota he
 And we feel good
 sangeet hamaare mood ko badal detaa he
 ंगीmusic decreases the level of cartisol in the brain
 jisase dimag behatar tareeke se kaam karata he
 The nerves of the brain get tired due to work
 sangeet sunne se dimag ko aaraam miltaa he jahaan par kai baar dawaaen kaam nahin karti hai 
 Music therapy works there
 kuch vaigyanik shodh yah bataate hai ki jab insaan kisi tarah ke dard se peedit hota he to use uskaa man pasand sangeet sunaaya janaa chahie 
 Due to which his attention is removed from the pain
 or use dard kaa ehsaas kam hota he
 Listening to music causes higher dopamine levels in the brain
 jo khushi paidaa karata he
 According to US scientists, music therapy is good for the lungs
 saans se sambandhit rogi ko sangeet therapy se ilaj karne se phayda miltaa he
 But serious respiratory diseases cannot be cured by this
 jin logon kii yaadasht acchhee nahin hoti he
 They should listen to music
 jisase unki yaadasht acchhee ho jaati he
 And the brain starts working much better
 sangeet sunne se dimag ke andar endorfins hormone kaa straav hota he 
 According to scientists, listening to music for 30 minutes daily increases the capacity of the heart
 eksrasij ke saath sangeet sunne se dil kii kaaryakshmata ke andar ijapha hota he
 Listening to good music breaks the useless thoughts going on inside the brain
 or raat ke samay dimag puraa khaali ho jane se acchhee neend aati he
 Generally people who do not sleep should listen to good songs for some time before going to sleep
 naresh bhartiya britain main based bhartiya mul ke hindi lekhak he
 BBC for a long time Radio was associated with Hindi service
 unke lekh bharat kii pramukh patrikaon main prakashit hote rahe hai
 He has received the Padmanand Sahitya Samman for his collection of books in the form of 'uis Paar Is Paar'
 unke is sankalan kii visheshta yah he ki unke jo lekh pehle patrikaon main prakashit ho chuke the unhone sankalan main aavashyak badlaav karne main koi gurez nahin kiya
 This is an exemplary step for Hindi writers
 varsh 2003 main aatankwaad par unki pustak `aatankwaad' prakashit hui he
 Naresh also writes Indian poetry, but writing is his favorite genre
 nareshji kisi bhi prakaar kii saahitiyik raajnneeti se dur nirantar lekhan main vyast rahete hai
 His first novel Dishaye Badal Gayi was released in the Indian capital, Delhi
