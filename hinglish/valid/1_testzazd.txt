 The Kuznets curve is Simon Kuznets' graphical representation of the hypothesis that when a country develops, a natural cycle of economic inequality driven by market forces arises
 aarambhik charan main asamanta main vruddhi dikhaayi detii he or phir ek nishchit ausat aay ke baad yah kam hone lagati he
 This curve shows that when economic growth starts, only a few people benefit from income growth, so the disparity in the distribution of income starts decreasing along with economic growth, due to which it is inverted 'U' shape
 goes

 The first hypothesis was made by economist Simon Kuznett in the 1950s and 60s

 Whereas in mature economies, human capital acquisition replaces physical capital acquisition as the main source of growth; And inequality slows down development by lowering education levels because poor, disadvantaged people do not finance their education in incomplete debt-markets
 kujanets vakr kaa arth he ki ek desh audyogikaran ke daur se guzar rahaa he - or visheshkar krishi ke yantrikaran - desh kii arthvyavastha kaa centre shaharon main badal jayega
 As there is internal migration by farmers in search of better-paid jobs in urban centers, there is a significant difference of inequality among villagers, as rural population declines as urban population increases

 Kuznett believed that inequality follows an inverted "U" shape, which rises as it rises and then falls with the increase of per capita income

 The word Purana in Raghuvansh means "purana Patrapag Magannataram" and in Vedic poetry "ancient: chronicles" is given
 saanskrithik arth se hindu samskruti ke ve vishisht dharmagranth jinamein sristi se lekar pralay tak kaa itihaas-varnan shabdon se kiya gaya ho, puraana kahe jate he
 The mention of the word Purana is also found in the Vedic era including the Vedas, and hence it can be considered the most ancient
 atharvaveda ke anusaar "rich: saamani chhandansi puranan yajusha sah 11
7
2") arthath puraanon kaa aavirbhaav rik, sam, yajus oud chand ke saath hi hua tha
 In the Shatapatha Brahmin, the Puranavagamayya is called the Veda
 chaandogya upanishad ne bhi puraana ko veda kaha he
 In the Brihadaranyakopanishad and Mahabharata it is said that "history Puranabhyam Vedarth Mupabarhayet" means the Veda should be interpreted through the Purana
 inase yah spasht he ki vaidic kaal main puraana tathaa itihaas ko samaan str par rakhaa gaya he
 Five signs of Purana have been considered in the ancient lexicons such as the Amarakosh, etc
: canto, prefix, clan, manvantara, and hereditary
 mana jaataa he ki sristi ke rachanakarta brahmaji ne sarvapratham jis pracheenatam dharmagranth kii rachana kii, use puraana ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Puranas have been guiding deities, sages, humans - all since ancient times
 puraana manushya ko dharm evam niti ke anusaar jivan vyateet karne kii shiksha dete hai
 The Puranas analyze human deeds and prevent them from committing misdeeds
 puraana vastutah vedon kaa vistaar hai
 The Vedas are written in a very complex and dry language style
 vedavyas ji ne puraanon kii rachana or punarrachana kii
 It is said, "poornat Purana" which means, which is the complement of the Vedas, ie Purana
 vedon kii jatil bhashaa main kahi gai baton ko puraanon main saral bhashaa main samajhaayaa gaya hai
 Avatarism has been revered in the Puranas
 nirgun niraakaar kii satta ko maanate hue sagun saakaar kii upasna karnaa in granthon kaa vishay he
 The Puranas have stories of sin-virtue, religion-iniquity and karma-action, keeping different goddesses in the center
 prem, bhakthi, tyaag, seva, sahansheeltaa aise maanviya gun hai, jinke abhaav main unnat samaaj kii kalpana nahin kii ja sakati
 In the Puranas, a detailed description is found about the many forms of deities
 puraanon main satya ko pratishthit main dushkarm kaa vistrut chithran puranakaron ne kiya he
 Puranas have given a detailed account of the vicious tendencies of the deities, but the basic objective is the development of goodwill and the reputation of truth
 keval 5 matsay, vaayu, vishnu, brahman evam bhagavat puraanon main hi raajaaon kii vanshabali pai jaati he
 The Puranas are eighteen
 m-2, bha-2, br-3, va-4
 A-1, Na-1, P-1, Lin-1, C-1, Ku-1, Sk-1 According to Vishnu Purana, their names are - Vishnu, Padma, Brahma, Vayu, Bhagavata, Narada, Markandeya, Agni, Brahmavaivarta, Linga, Varaha, Skanda, Vamana, Kurma, Matsya, Garud, Universe and Future
 puraanon main ek vichitrataa yah he ki prayek puraana main atharaho puraanon ke naam or unakishlokasankhya he
 Names and verses are often found, there is a difference somewhere
 jaise kurm puraana main agni ke sthaan main vayupurana; markandeya puraana main lingapurana ke sthaan main nrisinghpurana; devibhagwat main shiv puraana ke sthaan main naarad puraana or matsay main vayupurana he
 Nowadays, two Puranas are found in the name of Bhagwat - one Shrimad Bhagwat, and the other Devi Bhagwat koun vastav main puraana he isapar jhagada rahaa he
 Ramashram Swami has proved in 'durjanmuchchapetika' that Shrimad Bhagwat is the Purana
 isapar kashinath bhatta ne 'durjanmukhmahachapetica' tathaa ek or pandit ne 'durjanmukhpadyapaduka' devibhagwat ke paksh main likhi thi
 According to Sukhsagar: puraanon main sabase purana vishnupurana hi prathit hota he
 There is no communal tussle and rage in it
 puraana ke paancho lakshan bhi usapar thik thik ghatate hai
 It describes the origin and rhythm of creation, manvantaras, Bharatadi Khandas and Suryadi Lokas, branches of Vedas and their divisions by Ved Vyasa, Surya Dynasty, Lunar Dynasty etc
 kali ke raajaaon main magadh ke maury raajaaon tathaa guptavansh ke raajaaon tak kaa ullekh he
 The leelas of Shri Krishna are also described, but not in the form as in the Bhagavata
 kuch logon kaa kahana he ki vayupurana hi shivpurana he kyonki aajkal jo shivpurana naamak puraana yaa uppurana he uski shloke sankhya 24,000 nahin he, keval 7,000 hi he
 There are four stages of Vayu Purana, which describe the origin of creation, the kalpas and manvantaras, the stories of Vedic sages, different creatures from the daughters of Daksha Prajapati, the lineage of Suryavanshi and Chandravanshi kings and the kings of Kali are often described according to Vishnupurana
 matsaypurana main manwantaron or rajvanshawaliyon ke atirikt varnshram dharm kaa bade vistaar ke saath varnan he or matsaivatar kii puri katha he
 There is a special way to describe the method of killing the demons, the mother, the mother, the ancestral, the idol and the temple
 shrimadbhagwat kaa prachaar sabase adhik he kyonki usamen bhakthi ke mahatmaya or shrikrishna kii lilaon kaa vistrut varnan he
 Within the nine wings, the unity of Jeevabrahma, the importance of devotion, the creation of Srishtila, the birth of Kapiladeva and the teaching of Sanskrit in accordance with the Vaishnava sentiment towards his mother, Manvantara and Rishivamsavali, Avatar which also has the context of Rishabhdev, Dhruva, Venu, Prithu, Prahlad etc
 There are many topics like Katha, Samudramathan etc
 par sabase bada dasham skandh he jisamen krishna kii lila kaa vistaar se varnan he
 On the basis of this wing, many texts of Sanskrit and language related to Krishnacharitas have been made from Shringar and Bhaktiras
 ekadash skandh main yadavon ke naash or barahawein main kaliyug ke raachaaon ke rajtv kaa varnan he
 Bhagwat's style of writing is different from other Puranas
 isaki bhashaa paandityapurna or sahitya sambandhi chamatkaaron se bhari hui he, isse isaki rachana kuch peeche kii maani jaati he
 Agnipuran is a unique Purana, in addition to dynasties and short stories, theology, politics, rajdharma, prajadharma, ayurveda, grammar, rasa, ornamentation, archeology, etc
 are many subjects
 isamen tantradiksha kaa bhi vistrut prakaran he
 The lineage of the kings of Kali has come up to Vikram, also an avatar affair
 isi prakaar or puraanon main bhi kathaayen hai
 Apart from Vishnupurana and Puranas which are found nowadays, there is doubt about the fact that they were not created from behind if the real Puranas are not found
 kai ek puraana to mat-matantaron or sampradaayon ke raag-dwesh se bhare hai
 Some establish the primacy of a deity, some establish the supremacy of a deity, some establish someone
 brahmavaivart puraana kaa jo parichay matsaypurana main diya gaya he uske anusaar usamen rathntar kalp or varah avatar kii katha honi chahie par jo brahmavaivart aajkal miltaa he usamen yah katha nahin he
 For those devotees who were not satisfied with the Raas of Vrindavan of Krishna, there is a description of the everlasting rasa in Goloka
 aajkal kaa yah brahmavaivart musalamaanon ke aane ke kai sau varsh peeche kaa he kyonki isamen 'julaha' jati kii utpatti kaa bhi ullekh he -- mlechhat kuvindakanyaayaan jola jatirbabhuv ha 
 In the Brahmapuran, there is a lot of description of the pilgrimages and their greatness, Anant Vasudev and Purushottam Mahatmya and many such pilgrimages have been written which cannot be called ancient
 'purushottamprasaad' se avashya jagannatha ji ke vishaal mandir kii ore hi ishaara he jise gangey vansh ke raja chodganga ne banwaaya tha
 The symptoms given in the Matsya Purana are not completely found even in the present-day Padmapuran
 vaishnav sampradayikon ke dwesh kii isamen bahut si baaten hai
 Such as pāडaिलilāक्षणā ,a, māyāvādaंदाīंदाa, tamāशास्त्रāstra, puणनāvārvāणनaत्याāti
 vaisheshik, nyaay, sankhya or charvak 'taamas shaastra' kahe gaye hai or yah bhi bataaya gaya he ki daityon ke vinaash ke liye buddha rupi vishnu ne asat buddha shaastra kaha
 Similarly, Matsya, Koorm, Linga, Shiva, Skanda and Agni Tamas have been called Puranas
 saransh yah ki adhikansh puraanon kaa vartmaan rup hajaar varsh ke bheetar kaa he
 All of the Puranas are communal, there is no doubt about it
 kai puraana bahut kuch apane pracheen rup main milte hai par unamem bhi sampradayikon ne bahut si baaten badha di hai
 Although most of the Puranas found today are full of back-made or projecting subjects, Puranas were prevalent since ancient times
 brihadaaranyak or shatapath brahman main likhaa he ki geeli lakdi se jaise dhuaan alag alag nikalataa he vaise hi mahaan bhoot ke nirishwaas se rugveda, yajurveda, samaveda, atharvangiras, itihaas, puranavidya, upanishad, shloke, sutara, vyaakhyaan or anuvyaakhyaan hue
 It is also written in the Chandogya Upanishad that history is the fifth Veda in the Puranas
 atyant pracheen kaal main vedon ke saath puraana bhi prachlit the jo yajna aadi ke avasaron par kahe jate the
 Many things which are in the signs of Purana are also in the Vedas
 jaise, pehle asat tha or kuch nahin tha yah sarg yaa sristitatv he; devasur sangram, urvashi pururava samvaad itihaas he
 Even in the Adi festival of Mahabharata, the names of some kings and some topics have been mentioned and their accounts have been told in the Purana by the learned Satkavis
 isse kaha ja saktaa he ki mahabharat ke rachanakaal main bhi puraana the
 It is also written in Manusmriti that Vedas, theology, history, Puranas etc
 should be narrated in Pitrukaryas
 ab prashn yah hota he ki puraana hai kiske banaae
 It is written in Reva Mahatmya under Shivpuran that the speakers of the eighteen Puranas are Matyavatisut Vyas
 yahi baat jan saadhaaran main prachlit he
 But in the Matsyapurana it is clearly written that earlier there was only one Purana, there were 18 Puranas from that
 brahmad puraana main likhaa he ki vedavyas ne ek puranasamhita kaa sankalan kiya tha
 The next thing is known from Vishnu Purana
 usamen likhaa he ki vyas kaa ek 'lomaharshan' naam kaa shishy tha jo suti jati kaa tha
 Vyas ji gave his Purana Samhita in his hands
 lomaharshan ke chah shishy the— sumati, agnivarcha, mithrayu, shanshpayan, akrutvran or saavarni
 Among these, Akitavran, Savarni and Shanshapayan created a code based on the Puranasamhita read from Lomhadisha
 vedavyas ne jis prakaar mantron kaa sangrahakar un kaa samhitaon main vibhaag kiya usee prakaar puraana ke naam se chale aate hue vritton kaa sangrah kar puranasamhita kaa sankalan kiya
 With the same code, he made three more letters of the disciples of Sut
 inhen samhitaon ke aadhaar par atharah puraana bane honge
 In all the Puranas, Matsya, Vishnu, Brahmapurana has been said to be the first, but what is the Brahmapurana that is prevalent nowadays, it has been said before
 jo kuch ho, yah to upar likhe pramaan se siddh he ki atharah puraana vedavyas ke banaae nahin hai
 Among the Puranas that are found today, the composition of Vishnupurana and Brahmapurana appears to be ancient
 vishnupurana main 'bhavishya rajvansh' ke antargat guptavansh ke raajaaon tak kaa ullekh he isse vah prakaran isa kii chhathi shatabdi ke pehle kaa nahin ho saktaa
 The Hindus of Bali island, which is next to Java, have got the universe
 in hinduon ke purvaj isa kii paanchavi shatabdi main bharatvarsh main purv ke dwipon main jaakar based the
 There is no 'future Dynasty Case' in the Baliwale Brahmadpuran, in which the name of Janamejaya's great-grandson Adhisimakrishna is found
 yah baat dhyaan dene kii he
 This shows that the future dynasty in the Puranas is linked backwards
 yahan par brahmadpurana kii jo pracheen pratiyaan milti hai dekhnaa chahie ki unamem bhoot or vartmaankalik kriya kaa prayog kahan tak he
 These verses are found in 'bhavishra Dynasty' description- ukt ansh se prakat he ki aadi brahmadpurana adhisimakrishna ke samay main bana
 Similarly, examination of Vishnupuran, Matsyapuran etc
 shows that Adi Vishnupurana was compiled in the time of Parikshit and Adi Matsyapurana was collected in the time of Adhishimakrishna, the great-grandson of Janamejaya
 puraana samhitaon se atharah puraana bahut pracheen kaal main hi ban gaye the, iskaa pataa lagata he
 The evidence of the prophecy in the Apastamb Dharmasutra is cited as follows- yah avashya he ki aajkal puraana apane aadim rup main nahin milte hai
 Many Puranas have been re-created due to lack of original Puranas, many things have been added to them
 praayah sab puraana shaiva, vaishnav sampradaay or saura sampradaayon main se kisi na kisi ke poshak hai, isamen bhi koi andeh nahin
 The worship of Vishnu, Rudra, Surya etc
 started from the Vedic period, then slowly some people started giving priority to one deity, others to others
 is prakaar mahabharat ke peeche hi sampradaayon kaa sutarapaat ho chalaa
 Puranasamhita was formed at the same time
 phir aage chalakar adipurana bane jinka bahut kuch ansh aajkal paae janevaale kuch puraanon ke bheetar he
 The purpose of the Puranas was to collect old chronicles, preach through some ancient and some mythological stories, to keep Dharmabuddhi stable in the masses by narrating Devamahima and Tirthamahima
 isi se vyas ne soot jati ke ek purush ko apni sankalit adipuranasamhita prachaar karne ke liye di
 There are 63 Shalakapurushas in the Jain tradition
 puraanon main inaki kathaayen tathaa dharm kaa varnan aadi he
 Many Puranas have been composed in Prakrit, Sanskrit, Apabhransh and other native languages
 donon sampradaayon kaa puraana-sahitya vipul pariman main uplabdh he
 Important material of Indian history is found in these
 jain dharm main 24 puraana to tirthakaron ke naam par hai; or bhi bahut se hai jinamein tirthakaron ke alokik charitra, sab devataaon se unki shreshthata, jaindharm sambandhi tatwon kaa vistaar se varnan, falstuti, mahatmaya aadi hai
 There are also separate Padmapuran and Harivansh
 mukhya puraana hai:- jinsen kaa 'adipurana' or jinsen kaa 'arishtanemi' puraana, ravishen kaa 'padmapurana' or gunbhadra kaa 'uttarpurana'
 These Puranas are also available in Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages
 bharat kii samskruti, parampara, darshanik vichaar, bhashaa, style aadi kii drushti se ye puraana bahut mahatvapurn hai

 Bhadrabahu Samhita buddha granthon main kahin puraanon kaa ullekh nahin he par tibet or nepal ke buddha 9 puraana maanate hai jinhen ve navdharm kehete hai — Carrot pudding is an Awadhi dish
 wiliam shakespeare – 23 april 1616) angreji ke kavi, kaavyatmakataa ke vidwaan naatakkaar tathaa abhinayta the
 His plays have been translated into almost all major languages
 shakespeare main atyant ucch koti kii sarjanaatmak pratibha thi or saath hi unhen kala ke niyamon kaa sahaj gyaan bhi tha
 As if he had got a boon from nature, so everything he touched became gold
 unki rachanaayen na keval angrej jati ke liye gaurav kii vastu hai varan vishwavanmay kii bhi amar vibhuti hai
 Shakespeare's imagination was as severe as his life experience
 at: jahaan ek ore unke naatakon tathaa unki kavitaaon se anand kii uplabdhi hoti he vahiin duusari ore unki rachanaaon se hamako gambhir jeevandarshan bhi praapt hota he
 Poets are rarely found in Shakespeare's equivalent in the history of world literature
 wiliam shakespeare, jon shakespeare tathaa meri arden ke jyeshtha putr evam teesri santan the
 He was born in Stratford on Avon
 balykaal main unki shiksha sthaneey free grammer skool main hui
 Due to the increasing economic difficulties of his father, he had to leave school and engage in small business
 jeevika ke liye unhone landan jane kaa nishchay kiya
 There was another reason for this determination
 kadachit charl kot ke jameendaar sar tamas lusi ke udyaan se hiran kii chori kii ore kanoonee kaarywahi ke bhay se unhen apana janmasthan chhodana padaa
 He was married to Ann Hathaway in 1582
 san 1585 ke lagbhag shakespeare landan aae
 He initially worked on a small job in a theater, but a few days later he became a member of Lord Chamberlain's company and took part in acting in London's premier theaters
 gyaarah varsh ke uparaant san 1596 main ye stretford aan evan laute or ab inhone apane parivaar kii aarthik vyavastha sudrudh bana di
 In 1597, he gradually renovated and expanded
 isi bhawan main san 1610 ke baad ve apana adhikadhik samay vyateet karne lage or vahiin san 1616 main unka dehanth hua
 There is considerable disagreement as to the date of the works of Shakespeare
 san 1930 main prasiddh vidvan sar i
ke
 chambers ne tithikram kii jo talika prastut kii vah aaj praaia: sarvamaanya he
 Nevertheless, the discovery of previous years has led to some new assumptions regarding dates
 in nai khojon ke aadhaar par mike manve mahoday ne ek naveen talika taiyaar kii he jo sar i
ke
 chambers kii suchi se kuch bhinn he
 Shakespeare's prolific talent continued to develop over the course of nearly 20 years of literary life
 saamaanya rup se is vikascram main chaar vibhinn avasthaaen dikhaai detii he
 The initial phase ended in 1595
 is kaal kii praaia: sabhi rachanaayen prayogtmak he
 Shakespeare had not yet been able to determine his path, and was therefore progressively implementing his various compositions, in the prolific style of the ancient comical plays, 'the Comedy of Errors' and 'the Taming of the Sou'
 Created taduparant 'loves lebers lost' main inhone lily ke darbari sukhaant naatakon kii paripati apanaai
 It has an atmosphere of court which is full of interesting dialogue of clever characters
 'di tu jentilmen ov verona' main green ke svachhndathawadi sukhaant naatakon kaa anukaran kiya gaya he
 Sad dramas are also imitative
 'richard tritiy' main maalon kaa tathaa 'titus andranicus' main kid kaa anukaran kiya gaya he kintu 'romeo and juliet' main moulikta kaa ansh apekshaakrit adhik he
 Both the famous poems written in the same period 'the Rape of Lucreis' and 'venus and Adonis' have the imprint of the erstwhile Italian lovemaking
 vikascram kii duusari avasthaa san 1600 main samaapt hui
 In this, Shakespeare presented many mature works to the world
 ab unhone apana maarg nirdhaarit tathaa aatmavishvaas arjeet kar liya tha
 'A Mid Summer Nights Dream' and 'the Merchant on Venice' are interesting and popular melodramas but even more important are Shakepeare's quintessential pleasures such as Much Ado About Nothing, 'as You Like It' and 'twelve Night'
 Written in time
 in naatakon main kavi kii kalpana tathaa uske man ke ahlad kaa uttam prakaashan hua he
 The best historical plays were also written at this time
 marlo se prabhavit 'richard dwitiya' usee shrenee kii purvavarti kriti 'richard tritiy' se rachanavinyas main kahin adhik safal he
 Both the parts of 'henry IV' and 'henry V' which are well known historical dramas, are compositions of this period
 shakespeare ke praaia: sabhi sonet jo apni utkrisht abhivyakti ke liye anupam hai, san 1595 ore 1607 ke bich likhe gaye
 The third stage, which ended in about 1607, holds special significance in Shakespeare's life
 in varshon main paariwarik vipatti evam swasthya kii kharabi ke kaaran kavi kaa man avasann tha
 Hence, most of the compositions of these days are sad
 vishwaprasiddh du:khant naatak hamelet, othelo, king lier or makebeth evam roman du:khant naatak julius sijar, 'antony and cleopatra' evam 'coriolenus' isi kalavadhi main likhe gaye or abhinit hue
 'trivialus and Cressida', 'all's well that ends well' and 'major for Major' have a mixed expression of happiness and grief, even then only the tragic part is predominant
 vikaas kii antim avasthaa main shakespeare ne pericules, sinvilin, 'di winters tail', 'di tempast' prabhruti naatakon kaa sarjan kiya, jo sukhaant hone par bhi du:khad sambhaavnaaon se bhare hai evam ek sandhya vaataavaran kii sristi karte hai
 These joyous sorrow plays are termed as romance or Shakespeare's last plays
 shakespeare ke sukhaant naatakon kii apni nijee visheshtaayen hai
 Although Platus is followed in 'the Comedy of Errors', other pleasant dramas are completely different from the ancient classical plays
 inkaa uddeshy prahasan dwaara kurupataaon kaa mitaanaa tathaa trutiyon kaa sudhaar karnaa nahin varan rochak katha or charitrachitran dwaara logon kaa manoranjan karnaa he
 The theme of almost all such plays is such intense feeling of love that spontaneously arises in the minds of young men and women
 premi janon ke maarg main pehle to baadhaayen utpann hoti hai kintu naatak ke ant tak kathinaaiyaan vinasht ho jaati hai or unka parinaam sampann hota he
 In these compositions, there is a poetic and imaginative expression of life and the whole atmosphere is full of joy
 shakespeare kaa parichay katipay ucchwargeey pariwaron se ho gaya tha or unamem jis prakaar kaa jivan unhone dekha usee kaa prakaashan in naatakon main kiya he
 The grief plays highlight the serious problems of human life
 in naatakon ke abhijaat kulotpann nayak kuch samay tak safalataa or unnati ke maarg par agrasar hone ke uparaant yatnaa or vinaash ke shikaar banate hai
 Shakespeare's opinion on the subject of what causes his grief and death is clearly expressed
 nayak kaa durbhaagya anshat: pratikul niyati evam paristhitiyon se udbhoot he, kintu isse kahin bada kaaran uski charitrik durbalata main miltaa he
 In ancient Greek tragedies, the protagonist was only decimated by faulty judgment or flawed attitudes, but, perhaps influenced by Christianity and moralism, Shakespeare placed the principal responsibility for the hero's downfall on his character in his plays
 hamelet, athelo, lier or makebeth - in sabhi ke swabhaav athwa charitra main aisi kami milti he jo unke ksht evam mrityu kaa kaaran banati he
 In these sad plays, dual duality is reflected, internal duality and multi-duality
 aantarik dwandv nayak ke man main, uske vichaaron or bhaawanaaon main utpann hota he or apni tivrata ke kaaran na keval nirnay kathin bana detaa he apitu kuch samay ke liye nayak kaa asul vichlit bhi kar detaa he
 This type of internal duality has led to the emergence of psychological subtlety and interestingness in plays
 bahya dwandv bahari shaktiyon kii spardhaa or unke sangharsh se utpann hota he, jaise do virdohi raajnneetik dalon athwa senaaon kaa parsparik virodh
 In Shakespeare's major grief plays, the atmosphere of bloodshed and horrific scenes has created a very terror environment
 isi bhanti hatya or pratishodh sambandhi drishyon ke samavesh se bhi avsaad kaa put gaharaa ho gaya he
 Shakespeare took all these features and instruments from certain old plays and playwrights such as Seneca, Kid, Marlow, and used them in his plays, keeping in mind the occasional public interest
 du:khant naatakon kii jin visheshtaon kaa ullekh hamane yahan kiya he ve na keval hamelet, athelo, king lier, or makebeth main milti hai varan romeo and juliet tathaa england or rome ke itihaas par aadhrut du:khant naatakon main bhi aanshik rup main vidyaman hai
 Many of the historical plays that Shakespeare composed are Roman historians
 in roman naatakon ke lekhan main shakespeare ne itihaas ke tathyon ko thodaa bahut badal diya he or katipay sthalon par aisa prathit hone lagata he ki jivan kaa jo chitra upasthit kiya gaya he vah pracheen rome kaa nahin apitu alizveth kaaleen england kaa he
 Despite this, these plays have always been popular, especially Julius Caesar and Antoine & Cleopatra
 antony aid cleopatra kavitvapurn anshon sa bharaa padaa he tathaa cleopatra kii charitrakalpana atyant prabhavotpadak he
 The events of Greek history are represented in the Times of Athens and Perikiles
 angreji itihaas par aadhaarit naatakon main kuch to aise hai jo keval aanshik rup main shakespeare dwaara likhe gaye hai kintu henry chaturth ke donon bhaag or henry pancham purna roopen shakespeare dwaara pranit hai
 The poet has achieved great success in these three plays
 inamen shaury or sammanbhaavna kaa atyant aakarshak pratipaadan hua he or phalstaff kaa charitra atyant rochak evam spruhaniya hai
 Marlow has been successfully imitated in Richard III and Richard II
 shakespeare ke purv ke adhikansh angreji aitihaasik naatakon main tathyon or ghatnaon kaa nirjeev chithran rahata tha tathaa kori itivrittatmakataa ke kaaran ve neeras hote the
 Shakespeare has made these types of plays come alive by making them miraculous
 antim naatakon main shakespeare kaa paripakv jeevandarshan miltaa he
 Mahakavi had different experiences in his life, which is reflected in his creations
 pranay vishyak sukhaant naatakon main kalpanavilas he or kavi kaa man aishwarya or yauvan kii vilasita main rama he
 Grief plays express such sad experiences that make life toxic
 shakespeare ke krititv kii parinti aise naatakon kii rachana main hui jinamein unki samyak buddhi kaa pratifalan hua he
 The poet now sees with his prudent view that both happiness and sorrow remain embedded in life, so both are transient
 jivan main du:kha donon sannivisht rahete hai, at: donon hi kshanik hai
 Happiness comes after grief in life, so equality in thought and behavior is desirable
 in antim naatakon se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki hinsa or pratishodh kii apeksha dayaa or kshamaa adhik shlaghneey hai
 These plays have special significance due to their serious moral message
 shakespeare ke naatak svachhndathawadi hai tathaa pracheen unani or latin naatakon kii parampara se pruthak hai
 Therefore, it is not appropriate to find classical features of object in them
 keval apane antim naatak 'di tempast' main unhone teenon anvitiyon kaa nirvaah kiya he
 In almost all other plays, only the implementation has been taken care of, in terms of time and place, they are absolutely essays
 kathavstu main sadaiv paryaapt vistaar miltaa he or saamanyat: usamen kai kathaayen antarnihit rahati hai
 For example, we can take a Mid Summer Nights Dream, The Merchant on Venice, As You Like It or King Lear
 in sabhi main anek kathaon ke mishran dwaara vastunirmaan sampann hua he
 But this does not mean that the design of Shakespeare's plays is flawed
 ant:kathaon kaa natyavastu main sundar, kalapurna reeti se gunfan kiya gaya he tathaa sampurna kathanak se sankalit ekta kaa abhas miltaa he
 In spite of the lack of inventions in the classical sense, emotional and imaginative integration has taken place in these romantic plays
 patrakalpana main shakespeare ko or bhi adhik safalataa mili he
 In his plays he has created many fascinating characters who come before us in their lively form
 samay ke saath charitranirupan kii prakriya adhikadhik sookshm evam kalatmak hoti gai
 For example, we can take Rosalin, Porcia, Viartrus, Rosalind, Vayala Prabhriti Pragalbha, women included in the Sukhanta plays, who constantly introduce their sharp intellect and speech
 duusari koti kii ve naariyaan hai jinke anupam saundarya or sankatpurna anubhavon ke kaaran man main karunaa kaa udrek hota he
 The major among such females are Juliet, Ophilia, Desdimona, Cardilia, Imogen etc
 du:khant naatakon main charitrachitran kaa atyadhik mahatv he
 For example, we can take Hamlet
 naatak kii samast ghatnaayen nayak ke charitra par kendrit hai or usee ke vyaktitv ke prabhaav se katha kaa vikaas hota he
 Partially the same is true for other sad plays
 pracheen unani naatakon main anek smaraneey paatr milte hai kintu naitik or manovaigyanik upkarnon ke sahare ankit kiye hue shakespeare ke pramukh paatr kahin adhik rochak evam aakarshak hai
 The characterization of grief plays has become even more miraculous with the use of internal duality
 shakespeare ke naatakon ke kuch anya paatr bhi ullekhneey hai jaise vidooshak or khalanaayak
 Among the clowns, Falstaff Touchstone, Feste and King Lear's loyal clowns are important
 khalnaayakon main richard tritiy, iyago, edmund iatiyon aadi kii gananaa hoti he
 As Hazlitt wrote, the power of Shakespeare shows that not only is his character distinguished but his majority of minor characters also hold their own personal importance
 yadhyapi shakespeare ke naatakon main kahin kahin gadhy kaa prayog hua he, tab bhi ve mulat: kaavyatmak he
 Most of his part is stitched
 yahi nahin, praaia: sabhi natya rachanaayen kaavyatmak gunon se bhari padi hai
 Shakespeare has created an enchanting effect by the production of imagination, figurative expressions, musical rhythms and gentle emotions
 pracheen kaal se naatakon kaa kavita kaa ek bhed maatr maanate aae the or shakespeare ne pracheen dharna sweekaar kii
 Prose has been used occasionally for special purposes
 kintu saamaanya rup se ham shakespeare ke naatakon ko kavyanaty kii sangya de sakate hai
 Poetry was excessive initially, but shanai: shanai: his form became restrained and he began to control the idea of purpose
 isi bhanti shakespeare kii style main samavisht karne ke liye nirantar prayaas kiya; falat: praarambhik naatakon main vistrut varnanon ev sundar rupakon kaa bahulya he apni pratibha kii praudhavastha main jab shakespeare apane prasiddh du:khant naatakon kii rachana kar rahe the us samay tak unki style santulit ho gai thi
 In primary stage, expression was more important and ideas were less important
 kintu is madhyamik kaal main vichaaron, bhaavon tathaa abhivyakti ke sadhano kaa samyak samanvay hua he
 This balanced system focused on Shakespeare's ideas and moral paradigms in the last years and ignored stylistic miracles
 isiilie antim naatakon kii style kahin kahin angadh ho gai he
 Shakespeare wrote his plays primarily for theater, although we also enjoy reading from him because of his poetic qualities
 tatkaaleen rangamanch kii banaavat abhinay kii vyavastha, darshakon kii lokaruchi, in sabhi kaa prabhaav shakespeare ke natyanirmaan par padaa
 Two examples will suffice
 us samay range hue paradon kaa upyog nahin hota tha, isliye naatakon main anek varnanaatmak anshon kaa samavesh hua he
 Location, time and situation were indicated by these descriptions
 naatakon main swagat evam swabhaashit kaa nirantar upyog isiilie sambhav ho sakaa ki rangamanch kaa aglaa trikonakar bhaag prekshkon ke bich tak aage badha rahata tha
 Shakespeare did the surgeon for many male and female characters only because his suitable actors were available
 darshakon ke manoranjanarth anek drishyon kii avatarana hui he jiname rangamanch par uttejk evam manoranjak paristhitiyon kaa pradarshan hua he
 Like today's realistic theater, the Elizabethan era theater was bound by abundant means and fixed arrangements
 abhinay or pradarshan donon hi apekshaakrit unmukt the, isliye shakespeare ke naatakon main paryaapt rujuta milti he
 In almost all types of plays, Mahakavi has embodied lyrical freedoms that are unique for their beauty and melody
 inke atirikt shakespeare kii vistrut kavitaayen hai, jinamein 'vinas and adonis', 'di rape aav lukris' tathaa sanets kaa ullekh aavashyak he
 All these works belong to the last decade of the 16th century when Shakespeare's heart was charmed by the effects of beauty and love
 'vinas and adonis' main ek pracheen premakatha ko atyant kaavyatmak reeti se varnit kiya gaya he
 'the Rape of Lucreus' tells the story of the misfortune and death of a supremely beautiful Roman woman
 sanets main kuch aise hai jo kavi ke ek mitra se sambandh rakhte hai jisane vivaah na karne kaa nishchay kar liya tha
 Shakespeare, referring to his form and qualities, urges him to change his determination
 saneton kaa doosraa kram ek shyamvarn mahila se sambandhit he jise prati kavi ke man main teevr aakarshan utpann hua tha kintu jisane us sneh kaa aadar na karke kavi ke us mitra ko apana pranay diya, jisko dhyaan main rakhkar saneton kaa pratham kram likhaa gaya tha
 The question of whether Shakespeare has published his inner feelings in these sennets or whether they are merely traditional works is highly disputed
 kathantargat "kaaryavyapaar kii yojana" ko kathanak kehete hai
 Both the words "story" and "story" originate from the Sanskrit "katha" metal
 sanskrit sahityashastra main "katha' shabd kaa prayog ek nishchit kavyarup ke arth main kiya jaataa rahaa he kintu katha shabd kaa saamaanya arth he-"vah jo kaha jaae'
 Here the presence of the hearer as well as the hearer is also ingrained because the word "say" is meaningful only when there is someone to listen to it
 shrota ke abhaav main keval "bolne' yaa "badbadaane' kii kalpana kii ja sakati he, "kehane' kii nahin
 At the same time, he does not fall within the limits of the "whatever is said" story

 Forster calls the narrative "chronological description of events"; eg, mid-day meal after breakfast, Tuesday after Monday, old age after puberty

 a story or a story is also usually a business plan, but no single story can be called a story; Because, the uniqueness of the narrative only overwhelms its chronological description
 "nayak ko nayika se prem hua or ant main usne uskaa varan kar liya
 '- is the story
 "nayak ne nayika ko dekha, vah usapar anurakt ho gaya
 By removing many obstacles to the attainment of his valor and dedication, in the end, he married the heroine
 '-kathanak he
 That is, the narrative is just the structure of any narrative literary work, whereas in the story, the form of the story emerges as clear, consistent and intelligent according to the content of the episode
 webstor ke anusaar kathanak kii paribhaasha is prakaar he- The above discussion inaugurates the important fact that while listening or reading the story, the listener or reader has the curiosity to know the events that follow, that is, he repeatedly asks or thinks what happened again, while in the plot He also raises the question "why did this happen?" "how did this happen?' e

 That is why the beginning, middle and end of the three are sure
 "aadam hawwa' ke aadi kathanak main in teenon sopanon ko spasht dekha ja saktaa he; yatha, nishedh, ulanghan tathaa dand 
 Story is an instrument of art, so in order to bring about excitement, it is necessary to have an element of contingency along with the sufficiency of life
