 Marshall's disciple John Maynard Keynes's treatise entitled 'general Theory of Employment, Interest and Money' is a special book of economics
 vastav main is granth ne paashchaatya arthshaastriyon kii vichaardhaara ko amul parivartit kar diya he
 On this basis, several important theories have emerged, such as Harad Domar's famous development model, Leontief's in-put output model
 pro samulson maanate hai ki koi bhi vyakti yaa arthshaastri ek baar keens ke vishleshan se prabhavit hone ke baad puraani vichaardhaaraon kii ore nahin lautaa
 Keynes's influence also led to his former critics becoming his supporters

 Keynes has been the father of microeconomics
 isi hetu unka granth 'saamaanya siddhant' itnaa lokapriy hua
 Anyway, in this book he explained the macroeconomic analysis

 According to him, employment depends on effective demand
 prabhavi maang swayan upyog tathaa viniyog par nirbhar karti he
 Consumption is determined by the size of income and the consumption propensity of society
 at: yadi rojgaar badhanaa he to upbhog tathaa viniyog donon main vruddhi karnaa chahie

 keens ne sarvapratham rashtriya aay kii paribhaasha is prakaar di jisase use samaaj main rojgaar kaa nirdhaaran karne main sahaayta mili
 Just as 'price' is the basis of Marshall's value theory, the basis of Keynes's employment theory is 'income'
 unke anusaar 'kul aay=kul upyogvyay+kul viniyog ' hoga
 He said for 'national income' that since there is' income = utilization + savings and 'expenditure = consumption + appropriation', hence 'use + savings = consumption + appropriation' or 'savings = appropriation'
 keens kaa aay vishleshan hi hamen yah nirdesan detaa he ki arthvyavastha ko baari utaar-chadhaav se bachaane ke liye yah aavashyak he ki bachat or viniyog main samanta banaae rakhaa jaae
 To overcome the effects of the recession, Keynes has supported government spending and policies to increase consumption propensity by cheap infrastructure, public works and proper distribution of funds
 kines kaa siddhant viksit deshon par adhik tathaa alpaviksit deshon par kam lagu hota he
 But if effective demand and savings can also be generated in underdeveloped countries, Keynes's economics can apply there as well

 Motivation is a theoretical construct used to explain behavior
 yah logon ki karvai, ichchhaaon or zaruuraton ke liye kaarnon kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Motivation can also be defined as the direction of behavior
 ek makasad ek nishchit tareeke se kaary karne ke liye vyakti ko sanket detaa he yaa kam se kam vishisht vyavhaar ke liye ek jhukaav viksit karata he
 For example, when a person fulfills his hunger needs by eating food, or when a student does all his work in school to get good marks

 prerana ke siddhanton ko kai prakaaron main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Motivation can be divided into two distinct theories - intrinsic motivation and external motivation

 There is a willingness to observe internal motivation and to analyze one's ability to acquire knowledge, to seek out new things and new challenges

 Common motives are rewards such as money or good points, for showing desired behavior and the risk of punishment following abuse
 pratiyogita ek bahya prerak he kyonki vah jeetne ke liye or dusron ko haraane ke liye kalakaar ko protsaahit karti he naa kii bas gatividhi ke aantarik puraskaar kaa anand len
 Social psychological research has indicated that external rewards can lead to over-exaggeration and lead to a lack of intrinsic motivation

 Kidney inflammation is called glomerulonephritis in medicine
 kidney kii sujan kidney kii waisi beemaari he jiske kaaran kidney ke filter main sujan ho jaati he
 The kidney filter is made up of very small blood vessels in the kidney, called glomeruli
 jab yah achaanak shuru hota he to yah gambhir ho saktaa he or jab isaki shuruyaat dhire-dhire hoti he to yah chronic ho saktaa he
 But in both cases its consequences can be frightening
 iskaa jald pataa lagane or jaldi ilaaj ho jane par isse kam nuksaan hoga
 But if left untreated for a few months, it can cause permanent kidney damage! isliye agyantavash iske lakshanon ko kabhi bhi nazarandaaj na karen
 It is very important to understand its symptoms so that the kidney can be saved with the help of timely nephrology interpolation
 hamaari kidney main lakhon kii sankhya main glomeruli hote hai
 These are small filters in the kidney
 inke kshatigrast ho jane par, kidney adhik samay tak gandagi or adhik taral ko kushalta purvak nikaal nahin sakati he
 If the disease persists, the kidneys may stop functioning completely
 khun kaa filter nahin hone ke kaaran kidney felyor ho saktaa he athwa mutr main mil saktaa he
 - Swelling on the face upon waking, swelling in the ankles due to accumulation of water — bhure rang kaa mutr yaa mutr main rakt aana - Urine foaming — mutr main protein maujuud hona - Less urination — fefde main taral kaa hona jiske kaaran khaansee or saans lene main dikkat hona - high blood pressure beemaari ke gambhir ho jane par rogi iske lakshanon ko mahasoos karegaa
 But in chronic cases, symptoms develop slowly that sometimes patients do not understand those symptoms
 is tarah, agyanta ke kaaran, kidney ke filter ke inflameshan ke kaaran kidney ko sthaayee kshati ho jaati he or kidney felyor ho jaataa he
 People suffering from kidney failure may have reduced appetite, nausea and vomiting
 ve thakaavat mahasoos kar sakate hai or raat ke dauraan mansapeshiyon kii anthan ke kaaran unhen neend aane main kathinaayee ho sakati he
 Their skin may become dry and itchy skin
 kuch marijon ko peeth ke upree hisse main, pasaliyon ke peeche kidney main atyadhik dard ho saktaa he
 The disease can be acute due to decreased immune response to infections such as sore throat or skin infections caused by streptococcal
 zyaadaatar maamalon main aise sankraman thik ho jate hai or kidney main sudhaar hota he
 Many primary kidney problems have an effect on the glomerulus
 jaise, nephropathy main nunatam parivartan, exsgs 
 Most of these problems are cured by early treatment
 madhumeh jaisi pranaligat bimariyon, or lupas or eensie vascultice jaisi kuch aato immun bimariyon se peedit logon main secondary glomerulonefritis viksit ho jaataa he
 In such conditions, the kidney can be saved by timely treatment
 kabhi-kabhi dard nivarak or antibiotic dawaaiyon ke dushprabhav ke kaaran bhi glomerulonefritis ho saktaa he
 The patient improves by identifying the side-effects and not consuming them
 kuch sthiti paariwarik hoti hai
 The risk of chronic glomerulonephritis increases if the problem is not identified and not treated
 yah sthiti durbhaagya se teji se badhane vaali hoti he
 However, if treated correctly by a nephrology specialist, the disease stops growing
 ucch raktchaap hona, visheshkar iskaa kam umr main hi hona yaa ise niyantrit karne main mushkil aana glomerulonefritis shuru hone kaa sanket ho saktaa he
 Swelling, indigestion, weakness are its other symptoms
 urine main arabisi / rakt or protein kii upasthiti kaa pataa lagane vaali jaanch bahut sasti hai or yah aasaani se uplabdh pareekshan he
 Blood tests such as urea creatinine ANA C3 C4 ANCA c and p ASO help the doctor determine which type of disease you have and how much damage your kidney has caused
 yadi kidney kaa aakaar saamaanya he, to kidney biopsy kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 The biopsy report helps the doctor plan the best treatment for you
 is beemaari kaa ilaaj sthiti ke acute yaa chronic hone, iske antarnihit kaarnon or lakshanon kii gambhirtha par nirbhar karata he
 Glomerulo nephritis that occurs after infection usually resolves automatically after infection is controlled
 iske alaava, rogi ko shaayad drav kaa seven kam karnaa padegaa, or sharaab yaa adhik protein, namak yaa potashium vaale peya yaa khaadya padaarthon ke seven se bachanaa hoga
 Diuretics can help reduce high blood pressure and improve slow kidney function
 raktchaap kii dawa rakt vahikaaon ko aaraam pahunchaati he
 a person suffering from immune problems may have to undergo plasmapheresis
 plasmaferesis ek yantric prakriya he jisamen rakt se plasma ko antibody ke saath nikaal diya jaataa he, or isaki jagah par anya drav yaa daan diye gayi plasma ko chadhaaya jaataa he
 Depending on the underlying cause, medications such as steroids, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine MMF, etc
 may be required
 kidney felyor ke maamle main, dialysis kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 But such treatment is needed temporarily and dialysis can be discontinued once the kidney improves
 yadi is sthiti main beemaari kaa ilaaj nahin ho paata he, to yah beemaari chronic or progressive ho jaati he
 Even in such situations, proper dietary planning with drugs and nephrology follow-up is necessary to slow the progression of the disease
 — gale main kharash yaa rukaawat paidaa karne vaale stryptococal sankraman kaa ilaaj karaaen
 - Keep diabetes and blood pressure under control — surakshit sex karen or hepatitis bi, si or echivi jaise sankraman se bachane ke liye gaiyrkanoonee intravenus dawaaon ke istemaal se bachein jo glomerulonefritis kaa kaaran ho saktaa he
 - Do not ignore the initial symptoms of bloating, indigestion and high blood pressure
 — mutr jaanch kii report main protein or arabisi / rakt paye jane ko kabhi bhi nazarandaaj nahin karen
 - If your doctor recommends a kidney biopsy, do not fear
 is tarah kii prakriya aapaki kidney kaa ilaaj karne main sahaayak ho sakati he
 - Adopting a healthy lifestyle, along with exercise, quality complete sleep and the intake of a healthy low protein diet, will help prevent the growth of kidney failure in the case of chronic glomerulonephritis
 — glomerulonefritis ke sabhi charnon main nefrolologist se niyamit rup se jaanch karana aavashyak he

 swaleenta mastishk ke vikaas ke dauraan hone vaala vikaar he jo vyakti ke saamaajik vyavhaar or sampark ko prabhavit karata he
 In Hindi, it is also called 'self-immolation' and 'self-pity'
 isse prabhavit vyakti, simit or doharaav yukt vyavhaar karata he jaise ek hi kaam ko baar-baar doharaana
 It all starts before the child is three years old
 in lakshanon kaa samucchy aatmavimoh ko halke aatmavimoh spectrum vikaar se alag karata he, jaise asparger syndrome
 Autism is a mental disease whose symptoms start appearing from birth or from childhood
 jin baccho main yah rog hota he unka vikaas anya baccho kii apeksha asaamaanya hota he
 No single cause of autism has been discovered
 anushodhon ke anusaar otism hone ke kai kaaran ho sakate hai jaise- Narcissism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of narcissism are complex and it is unclear whether the cause of ASD is polygynous or rare mutations
 durlabh maamalon main, aatmavimoh ko un karkon se bhi joda gaya he jo janm sambandhi dosha ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Other proposed causes, childhood vaccines, are controversial and there is no scientific evidence
 haal kii ek samiksha ke anumaan ke mutabik prati 1000 logon ke peeche do maamle aatmavimoh ke hote hai, jabaki se sankhya ASD ke liye 6 / 1000 ke kareeb he
 The average ASD to male: female ratio is 4,3: 1
 1980 se aatmavimoh ke maamalon main naatakeey dhang se vruddhi hui he jiskaa ek kaaran chikitsiya nidaan ke kshetra main hua vikaas he lekin kya asal main ye maamle bade he yah ek unuttarit prashn he
 Narcissism affects many parts of the brain, but its causes are not understood properly
 aamtaur par mata pita apane bachche ke jivan ke pehle do varshon main hi iske lakshanon ko bhaanp lete hai
 Early cognitive or behavioral interventions can help children develop self-care, social and interaction skills
 iskaa koi ilaaj nahin he
 Very few autistic children are able to become self-sufficient when they become adults
 aajkal ek aatmavimohi samskruti viksit ho gayi he, jisame kuch logon ko ilaaj par vishwaas he or kuch logon ke liye aatmavimoh ek vikaar hone ke bajaay ek sthiti he
 Narcissism may be better understood by a group of specific symptoms than by a symptom
 mukhya lakshanon main shaamil hai saamaajik sampark main asamarthta, baatcheet karne main asamarthta, simit shauk or doharaav yukt vyavhaar he
 In other aspects, such as the strange way of eating, however, it is common but not necessary for diagnosis
 saamaajik vikaas aatmavimoh ke shikaar manushya saamaajik vyavhaar main asamarth hone ke saath hi duusare logon ke mantavyon ko samajhane main bhi asamarth hote hai is kaaran log aksar inhen gambhirtha se nahin lete
 Social disabilities last from childhood to adulthood
 otistic bachche saamaajik gatividhiyon ke prati udasin hote he, wo logo kii ore naa dekhte hai, naa muskuraate hai or zyaadaatar apana naam pukaare jane par bhi saamaanya: koi pratikriya nahin karte hai
 The behavior of autistic babies is even more shocking, they do not shake their eyes, and they often touch and shake the other person's hand to speak
 teen se paanch saal ke bachche aamtaur par saamaajik samaj nahin pradarshit karte he, bulaane par ekadam se pratikia nahin dete, bhaawanaaon ke prati asamvedansheel, mook vyavhaari or dusron ke saath mud jate hai
 Despite this, they remain attached to their primary caregiver
 aatmavimoh se grasit bachche aam baccho ke mukaable kam sanlagn suraksha kaa pradarshan karte hai yadhyapi yah lakshan ucch mastishk vikaas vaale yaa jinka e es di kam hota he vaale bacchon main gaayab ho jaataa he
 Older children and adults with ASD perform very poorly in the test of recognizing faces and emotions
 aam dharna ke vipareet, aatistic bachche akele rahanaa pasand nahin karte
 Making friends and maintaining friends often prove difficult for the autistic child
 inke liye mitron kii sankhya nahin balki dosti kii gunvattta myne rakhti he
 There are plenty of stories about the anger and violence of people with ASD, but very few scientific studies
 yah simit aankade bataate hai ki aatmavimoh ke shikaar mand buddhi bachche hi aksar aakraamak yaa ugr hote he
 Dominic et al, interviewed parents of children with 67 ASD and concluded that two-thirds of children have such times in their lives when their behavior becomes very bad while one-third of children become aggressive, often Children who do not know the language properly are tantrums
 baalyavastha main saamaanya bacchon va otistic bacchon main kuch pramukh antar hote hai jinke aadhaar par is avasthaa kii pahchaan kii ja sakati he jaise ki- One third to half of the autistic people do not develop language comprehension and ability to speak to meet the needs of their daily life
 sanchaar main kamiyaan jivan ke pehle varsh main hi drushtigochar ho jaati hai jiname shaamil he, der se bolnaa, asaamaanya bhav, mand pratikriya or apane paalak ke saath huye vaartalap main saamanjasy kaa nitant abhaav
 In the second and third years, autistic children speak less, as well as their word accumulation and word combination
 unke bhav aksar unke bole shabdon se mail nahin khate
 Autistic children are less likely to request or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat what others say
 kaaryaatmak sambhaashan ke liye sanyukt dhyaan aavashyak hota he or is sanyukt dhyaan main kami, ASD shishuon ko anyon se alag karata he : udhaaharan: ho saktaa he bajaay us vastu ko jisaki ore wo ishaara kar rahe hai wo us haath ko dekhen jisase wo ishaara kar rahe hai or wo lagaataar aansa karne main vifal ho rahe hon
 Autistic children may have difficulty in imaginative games and learning languages
 koi ek khaas doharaav aatmavimoh se sambadhit nahin he, lekin aatmavimoh in vyavhaaron ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Early detection of autism and immediate consultation with a psychiatrist is the first treatment
 otism ke lakshna dikhne par manochikitsak, manovaigyanik, yaa prashikshit special agucator se sampark karen
 Autism is a lifelong condition for which a drug search is on for complete treatment, so do not wander here and there for time to get information about it
 otism ek prakaar kii vikaas sambanghit beemaari he jise puri tarah to thik nahin kiya ja saktaa, parantu sahi prashikshan va paraamarsh ke dwaara rogi ko bahut kuch sikhaaya ja saktaa he, jo use apane roj ke jivan main apni dekharekh karne main madad karata he
 70% of the people with autism have mental retardation due to which they are not fully able to live a normal life, but if the mental impairment is not very high, then the person with autism can learn a lot
 kabhi-kabhi in bacchon main kuch aisi kaabiliyat bhi dekhi jaati hai jo saamaanya vayaktiyon kii samaj va pahuch se dur hoti hai
 a child with autism can be helped in the following ways- yadi baccha koi ek vyavhaar baar-baar karata he to use rokane ke liye use kuch aisi gatividhiyon main lagaaein jo use vyast rakhen taaki ve vyavhaar doharaa na sake, National Highway 22- 459 km long This highway runs from Ambala to Shipkila near indo-tibet border

 The complete number of constellations and the names of their superordinate deities are also found in the Yajurveda
 yajurveda main tithi tathaa pakshon, uttar tathaa dakshin ayan or vishuv din kii bhi kalpana he
 The equinox day is the day on which the sun stays at the equinox and the revolution
 shri shankar baalkrishna dikshit ke anusaar yajurveda kaalik aaryon ko guru, shukr tathaa rahu ketu kaa gyaan tha
 Scholars differ about the creation of the Yajurveda
 yadi ham paashchaatya pakshpaati, kith kaa mat bhi len to yajurveda kii rachana 600 varsh isa purv ho chuki thi
 After this comes the period of Vedang astrology, which ranges from 1,400 years BC to 400 years BC
 vedang jyotish ke anusaar paanch varshon kaa yug mana gaya he, jisamen 1830 madhya sawan din, 62 chandra maas, 1860 tithiyaan tathaa 67 nakshatra maas hote hai
 The names of the five years of the era are: Samvatsar, Parivatsar, Idavatsar, Anuvatsar and Idvatsar 1 According to this the date and lunar constellation were calculated
 iske anusaar maason ke madhya sawan dinon kii gananaa bhi kii gai he
 The important thing that we find in Vedang jyatish is the imagery of the era, in which medium date is derived by finding the medium speed based on the direct perforation of sun and moon
 aage aanevaale siddhant jyotish ke granthon main isi pranali ko apanaakar madhyam grah nikaale gaye hai
 No astrology calculations are available within Vedang Astrology and Siddhanta Astrology
 kintu is bich ke sahitya main aise pramaan milte hai jinase yah spasht he ki jyotish ke gyaan main vruddhi avashya hoti rahi he, udhaaharan ke liye, mahabharat main kai sthanon par grahon kii sthiti, grahayuti, grahayudh aadi kaa varnan he
 It is so clear that during the time of Mahabharata, Indians were familiar with the planetary perforation and their position
 siddhanth jyotish pranali se likhaa hua pratham paurush granth aryabhat pratham kii aryabhatium he
 Then there is the Siddhantpanchika, edited by Barahamihira, which has a collection of Peetamaha, Vasistha, Romak, Pulish and Suryasiddhanta
 isse yah to pataa chalata he ki barahamihir se purv ye siddhantagranth prachlit the, kintu inke nirmaankaal kaa koi nirdesh nahin he
 In general, Indian astrologers have considered them as inauspicious
 aadhunik vidwaanon ne anumaanon se inke kaalon ko nikaala he or ye paraspar bhinn hai
 It is certain that these Vedangs had become prevalent within the time of astrology and Barahamihira
 iske baad likhe gaye siddhantagranthon main mukhya hai : brahmagupta kaa brahmasiddhant, lall kaa shishydhivriddhid, shripati kaa siddhanthashekhar, bhaskaracharya kaa siddhant shiromani, ganesh kaa grahalaghav tathaa kamalaakar bhatta kaa siddhant-tatv-vivek
 There are two classifications of the texts of Mathematical Astrology: Siddhantha Granth and Karanagranth
 siddhantagranth yugadi athwa kalpadi paddati se tathaa karangranth kisi shaq ke aarambh kii gananaapaddati se likhe gaye hai
 Mathematics is the main propounding subject of astrological texts: enumeration of middle planets, enumeration of apparent planets, problems, country and time, sun and lunar eclipse, planetary, planetary, sunrise, planets of the moon, observance and interpretation of observatories
 puure vrutt kii paridhi 360 maan lee jaati he
 Its 360th part is one part, 60th part of one art, 60th part of art is one Vikala, 60th part of one Vikala is one antiquity
 30 ansh kii ek raashi hoti he
 For calculating the planets, 12 parts of the eclipse in which the Sun appears to be traveling
 in bhaagon ko mesh, vrish aadi raashiyon ke naam se pukaara jaataa he
 To tell the position of the planet, from zodiac to zodiac, part, art, and development of the planet are told
 yah grah kaa bhogaansh hota he
 In the Siddhanta texts, the parts and ranges of a circle are divided by 24 parts
 inkaa maan kalatmak rahata he
 The sine of an arc of 90 is the radius of the circle, which is called the radius
 isko nimnlikhit sutara se nikaalte hai : Thus the value of the radius is 3438 art, which is adjacent to the actual value
 chaap kii jya aadhunik pranali kii tarah ardhajya he
 In fact, the present triangular results have been developed on the basis of the Indian system and Aryabhata is considered its inventor
 yadi kinhin do bhinn aakaar ke vritton ke trikoshmetiya maanon kii tulana karnaa apekshit hota he, to vrihad vrutt kii trigya tathaa abhisht vrutt kii nishpatti ke aadhaar par abhisht vrutt kii paridhi anshon main nikaali jaati he
 Thus, although the number of degrees in the new order is only 360 in slow and quick circles, the lower numbers written in theses are only for comparative calculation
 vishuvad vrutt main ek samgati se chalanevaale madhyam surya ke ek udai se duusare udai tak ek madhyam sawan din hota he
 It is similar to 'civil Day' in present-day English
 ek sawan din main 60 ghati; 1 ghati 24 minutes saath pal; 1 pal 24 senked 60 vipal tathaa dhai vipal 1 senkend hote hai
 The period of the Earth's orbit relative to a stationary point of the Sun is called the Solar Year
 yah sthir bindu meshadi he
 By the time of the fifth century of Christ, this point was in the radius and equinox
 ab yah us sthaan se lagbhag 23 pashchim hat gaya he, jise aynansh kehete hai
 Ayāngati is not the same in various texts
 yah lagbhag prati varsh 1 kala maani gai he
 The current microcosm is 50
2 percent
 siddhantagrathon kaa varshmaan 365 dipho 15 ghapoo 31 patto 31 vitho 24 prati vitho he
 This is actually a value of 8
 34
 37 Paladi is more
 itane samay main surya kii gati 8
27" hoti he
 Thus, due to our year old, there is more imagination of unpredictability
 varshon kii gananaa ke liye saura varsh kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 For lunar months for the census
 surya or chandramaa jab raashyadi main samaan hote hai tab vah amantkaal tathaa jab 6 raashi ke antar par hote hai tab vah poornimantkaal kehalaata he
 There is a lunar month from one moon to another, but the condition is that the sun must come from one zodiac to another at that time
 jis chandra maas main surya kii sankranti nahin padati vah adhimaas kehalaata he
 In such a year, there are 13 months instead of 12
 isi prakaar yadi kisi chandra maas main do sankrantiyaan pad jaayan to ek maas kaa kshay ho jayega
 In this way, the system is associated with the solar system even when the measurements are moon
 chandra din kii ikai ko tithi kehete hai
 It is equal to the 12th of the difference between the Sun and the Moon
 hamaare dharmik din tithiyon se sambhddha he1 chandramaa jis nakshatra main rahata he use chandra nakshatra kehete hai
 In ancient times, lunar constellations were used in place of war
 kaal ke bade maanon ko vyakt karne ke liye yug pranali apanaai jaati he
 that goes: suryasiddhant main bataae aankadon ke anusaar kaliyug kaa aarambh 17 farvari 3102 itho puchho ko hua tha
 The calculation system of Ego from the era, similar to the days of Julian Day number, can be helpful in calculating past and future dates
 grah kii meshadi ke saapeksh prithvi kii parikrama ko ek bhagan kehete hai
 In the Siddhanta texts, there are fractures between yugas, or kalpagrahs
 yug yaa kalp ke madhya sawan dinon kii sankhya bhi di rahati he
 If the planets are in Ariesadi at the beginning of Yuga or Kalpa, then the middle planet can be removed from the Triassic by knowing the middle day
 bhagan kii paribhaasha ke anusaar budh or shukr kii madhyam gati surya ke samaan hi maani gai he
 His speed is comparable to his actual speed
 ye grah rekhadesh, arthath ujjayini, ke yamyottar ke aate hai, jinhen deshaantar tathaa char sanskaron se apane sthaan ke mayam saryodayasannakaalik banaaya jaataa he
 When the apparent speed of the apparent sun and the moon is at its lowest, the portion of the apparent sun and moon at that time should be considered as the enjoyment of their light
 spasht ravi chandra or madhyam ravi chandra ke antar ko mandafal kehete hai
 Mandnech will be 180 from Mandotch
 mandoch se chah raashi tak spasht surya chandra madhyam surya chandra se peeche rahete hai
 That is why slow fruit is negative
 mandoch se madhyam grah ke antar kii mandakentre sangya he
 At the difference of 3 zodiacs from the retarded, the bradycardia is perishable
 use mandantya fal kehete hai
 The apparent planet from Mendeich to Mendoch is ahead of the middle planet, hence Mandafal is wealth
 mandaspasht ravi chandra ke mandafal ko gyaat karne ke liye do prakaar ke kshetron kii kalpana he, jinhen bhangi kehete hai
 The name of the first is the circumcision
 bhu ko centre maanakar ek trigya ke vyasaradh se vrutt khinchaa, vah kakshavritt hua
 Drawing a circle with a radius diameter from its center, cut as the sine of the dimer at its vertical diameter, it will be retarded
 madhyam grah ko mandprativrutt main chalata kalpit kiya
 If you cut an arc equal to the center of the orbit even in the orbit, then there will be a middle planet in the orbit
 bhucendre se prativrutt sthit grah tak khinchi gai rekha kakshavritt main jahow lage vah mandaspasht grah hoga
 The difference between the medium and dim planets of the orbit will be retarded
 nichoch bhangi ke liye kakshavritt par sthit madhyam grah se mandantyafaljya tulya vyasaradh se ek vrutt khinch lete hai, jise mandaparidhi vrutt kehete hai
 a line going from the center of the orbit to the middle planet, where it is in the diagonal, is assumed to be dim, in the opposite direction in the dim periphery, the planets are imagined at the fractions of the center
 grah se bhucendre ko milaanevaali rekha jis sthaan par kakshavritt ko kaate vahaan mandaspasht grah hoga
 In this way, the dim sun and the moon show us at those places, because their sight is visible to us in relation to the earth
 shesh grahon ke liye bhi mandafal nikaalane kii waisi hi kalpana he
 Their dimorphs are made known by the illumination of the apparent planet by knowledge of the mentals
 ye mandaspasht grah drishy nahin hote, kyonki prithvi unke bhraman kaa centre nahin he
 It is clear from the above discussion that the dim planet is the enjoyment of the planet revolving in its orbit
 atev bhudrishy banane ke liye paanch grahon ke liye sheeghra fal kii kalpana kii gai he
 To clarify Mars, Mercury, Guru, Venus, and Saturn, an early fruit is conceived
 iske liye bhi mand prativrutt tathaa mandanichoch jaisi bhangiyon kii kalpana kii jaati he, jiske liye mand ke sthaan par sheeghra shabd rakh diya jaataa he
 Only the actual Madhyamgrahs for ingestions are called Jyotrikh
 unke madhya adhiktam ravigrahantar kone ko paramshighrafal, paramshighrafal kii jya ko shighranty faljya kehete hai
 The difference between the planet and the astral is the quick center
 isamen mandafal ke liye banaai gai bhangiyon kii tarah bhangiyaan banaakar shighrafal nikaala jaataa he
 With this type of rite, the position of the planet is known by making a favorable angle of the planet
 bahirgrahon ke liye ravikendrik paramalamban kii paramshighrafal tathaa ravi ko shighrochch maanakar shighrafal gyaat kiya jaataa he
 Acharyas have prescribed the method of sacrament of the early fruit in such a way that the enjoyment of the available planet can come true
 grahon kii kakshaayen chandra, budh, shukr, ravi, bhoum, guru, shani ke kram se uttarottar prithvi se dur hai
 Their center is believed to be Earth 1
 Although the radius of each orbit for the means of the planets is assumed to be radius equal, their distance varies because of their diffusivity
 shighrantyafalajyaon or trigyaon kii grahakakshavyasaardhan or ravikkshavyasaradh se tulana karne par budh, shukr, mangal, brihaspati tathaa shani kii kakshaon ke vyasaradh prithvi se ravi kii duuri ke saapeksh

 suryagrahan main lamban ke kaaran bhukendriya chandra tathaa hamen dikhaai denevol chandra main bahut antar aa jaataa he
 Therefore, knowledge of parallax is done for this
 chandrashrangonnati main chandramaa kii kalaon ko gyaat kiya jaataa he
 In the planetary authority, the period of the planets and the method of perforation in the favorable period and the revolution of sun and moon are considered in the right
 bhinn ayan tathaa ek golardh main hone par, sayan rivechand ke yoga 180° ke samay krantisamya hone par, vyatipaat tathaa ek ayan bhinn golardh main hone par vahi yoga 360° ke tulya ho to krantisamya main vaidhruti hoti he

 ishaninda ishwar kii shraddha, dharmik yaa pavitra logon se sambanddh chizein yaa dharmik rup se anulalanghaneey kaary kaa apmaan yaa avmaananaa ko kehete hai
 There are also laws related to blasphemy in various countries under which if someone intentionally damages a thing or place of worship or interrupts a religious gathering, or someone insults someone's religious sentiments by speaking or writing or with some scenes
 So that too is considered unlawful and there is a provision of certain punishment for this
