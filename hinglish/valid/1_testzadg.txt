 The process of his creation seems to have started from Guru Gorakhnath itself, because sometimes a collection of verses like Jogeshwar Sakhi are found in search

 a handwritten copy of Kabir's predecessor saint Nagdev, called Sakhi, has also been found, but it must have been compiled in northern India, possibly Punjab, because in Maharashtra, the voice of Namdev is called the post or abhaga, not Sakhi

 Sakhi has been written in the most versatile verses 'duha' since Apabhransh period, so 'duha' has also been considered synonymous but till Tulsidas's time it was not synonymous with Doha
 tulsidas kaa samay isa kii solahavin satrahavin shatabdi he
 It seems that in addition to Sakhi Doha from Kabir's time or even before that, Chaupai, Chaupai, Sar, Chappay, Haripad etc
 were also written in verses
 'guru granthsahab' main saakhi ko saloku kaha gaya he
 In Marathi literature too, 'saki' or 'sakhi' became popular with the influence of Hindi

 But respectively started to be used in other verses as well

 Chandragupta Vikramaditya King of Gupta Dynasty
 chandragupta dwitiya mahaan jinako sanskrit main vikramaditya yaa chandragupta vikramaditya ke naam se janaa jaataa he; gupt vansh ke ek mahaan shaktishaalee samraat the
 His kingdom lasted till 380-412 AD in which the Gupta dynasty attained its peak
 gupt samrajya kaa vah samay bharat kaa svarnim yug bhi kaha jaataa he
 Chandragupta II the Great was the son of his former king Samudragupta the Great
 usne aakraamak vistaar kii niti evam laabhdayak parigrahan niti kaa anusaar karke safalataa praapt kii
 Chandragupta II It is clear from Vikramaditya Samudragupta's epigraphy that many of his sons were grandchildren, but in his last time he appointed Chandragupta as his successor
 chandragupta dwitiya evam parvarti guptasamraaton ke abhilekhon se bhi yahi dhvanit hota he ki samudragupta kii mrityu ke uparaant chandragupta dwitiya hi guptasamrat hue
 But on the contrary, some scholars certify Ramgupta as the successor of Samudragupta on the basis of 'devi Chandragupta' and some other literary and archaeological inscriptions available in part
 ramgupta kii ayogyata kaa laabh uthaakar chandragupta ne uske rajya evam rani donon kaa haran kar liya
 The historicity of Ramgupta is doubtful
 bhilsa aadi se praapt tamra sikkon kaa ramgupta us pradesh kaa koi sthaneey shaasha hi rahaa hoga
 The date of Chandragupta II is determined based on his inscriptions etc
 chandragupta kaa, guptasanwat 61 main utkeern mathura stambhalekh, unke rajya ke paanchaven varsh main likhaaya gaya tha
 As a result, he ascended the Guptas in 61-5 = 56 = 375 AD
 chandragupta dwitiya kii antim gyaat tithi unki rajathamudraon par praapt haati he- guptasanwat 90+ 0= 409- 410 i

 From this one can infer that Chandragupta was probably ruling for the above mentioned year
 iske vipareet kumargupta pratham kii pratham gyaat tithi guptasanwat 96= 415 i
, unke bilsand abhilekh se praapt hoti he
 On this basis, it is estimated that the reign of Chandragupta II may have ended in 413–14 AD
 chandragupta dwitiya ke vibhinn lekhon se gyaat devgupt evam devraj-anya naam prathit hote hai
 Records and Mudra inscriptions give knowledge of his various titles - Maharajadhiraja, Parambhagavat, Srivikram, Narendrachandra, Narendra Singh, Vikramank and Vikramaditya etc
 unka sarvapratham sainik abhiyaan saurashtra ke shaq kshatrapon ke viruddh hua
 Detailed knowledge of conflict process and other allied subjects is not available
 chandragupta ke sandhivigrahik virasen shaab ke udaygiri guhaalekh se, unka samast prithvi jatine ke uddeshy se vahaan tak aana spasht he
 His long-standing presence in the Malava region is evident from the writings of the Gupta Samvat 82 of the feudatory ruler of Chandragupta, Sanakaniq Maharaj, and the Sanchi Gupta Samvat 93 of a magistrate named Amarkardava, obtained from this place
 sambhavat: chandragupta dwitiya ne shaq rudrasingh tritiy ke viruddh yusanchalan tathaa vijayoparant saurashtra ke shashan ko yaheen se vyavasthit kiya ho
 Chandragupta's Shakavijaya is also estimated from his Rajatamudras
 saurashtra kii shaqmudra parampara ke anukaran main prachlit in mudraon se bhi hota he
 Chandragupta ii's picture, name, Virud and date of Mudrachalana are written on these postures prevalent in imitation of Saukamudra tradition of Saurashtra
 shaq mudraon se gyaat antim tithi 388 i
 prathit hoti he
 In contrast, the first date of Chandragupta known from these coins is Guptasamvat 90+ 0
 falat: anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki chandragupta kii sarashtravijay praaia: 20 varshon ke sudeergh yuddh ke pashchaat 409 i
 ke baad hi kabhi purnroopen safal hui hogi
 Chandragupta's army chief Amarkardava, in his Sanchi inscription, calls himself, many Samaravaptavijayyasupatakas
 in anek samaron ke ullekh se yah bhi anumaan kiya ja saktaa he ki chandragupta ne shakayuddh ke atirikt anya yuddh bhi kiye honge
 But in the present situation his discussion is unproven
 dilli main qutubameenar ke parshv main sthit lauhastambh par kinhin chandra kii vijayprashasti utkeern he
 Chandra has been identified with various emperors of ancient India
 kintu praaia: vidvan unki pahchaan chandragupta dwitiya se karte hai
 If this theory is believed to be correct, then it will not be said that the second Chandragupta defeated the enemies who came in the organization of Vanga region and crossed the seven faces of the Indus and won the Vahlikas
 vang ko pahchaan saadharantaya purvi bengal tathaa bahli kii balkh se kii jaati hai, yadhyapi kuch aashcharya nahin jo vahlikon kii nivas pashchimi pakistan main hi kahin rahaa ho
 There are also difficulties in acknowledging Chandra's knowledge with Emperor Chandragupta II
 chandragupta dwitiya ne apana rajya pita dwaara uttaradhikaar main praapt kiya tha, kintu lauhastambh ke chandra ne apane swabhazarjit vistrut samrajya kaa ullekh kiya he
 The famous emperors in literature, Vikramaditya and Chandragupta Vikramvaditya, are both different emperors


 Some people add them and make fun of history
 chandragupta kaa samrajya suvistrut tha
 It included all the states ranging from Bengal in the east to possibly Balkh in the north and Arabian Sea in the northwest
 is vistrut samrajya ko sthirataa pradaan karne kii drushti se chandragupta ne anek shaktishaalee evam aishwaryonmukhi rajpariwaron se vivahasambandh sthapit kiye
 Her second queen Kubernaga herself was 'nagakulsambhuta'

 The geographical position of the serpents and the Vakatakas proves that they must have received sufficient strength and help to the Gupta empire
 kuntal pradesh ke kadamb naresh shaantivarman ke taalgund abhilekh se vidit he ki raja kakustha varman kii putriyaan gupt evam anya raajaaon ko byaahin thim
 Kumari must have been married to Chandragupta II or one of his sons
 samrajya ko shashan kii suvidha ke liye vibhinn ikaayiyon main vibhajit kiya gaya tha
 The emperor himself was the supreme officer of the kingdom
 uski sahaayta ke liye mantriparishad hoti thi
 The crown prince was the second high official after the king
 mantri mantriparishad kaa mukhya adhikari evam adhyaksh tha
 Chandragupta ii's minister was Shikharswamy
 inhen karamdand abhilekh main kumaramaatya bhi kaha he
 In this connection, it is known that during the Gupta period there used to be an independent council for the support of the Crown
 virasen shaab ko 'anvayapraptaschiv' kaha he
 These were the Sandhivigrahic of Chandragupta kintu senadhyaksh sambhavat: amrakardav the
 Among the presidents of the government departments of Chandragupta's time, the Kumaramatyadhikadhikaran tribunal; shashan kii sabase badi ikai praant tha

 There was a separate council for the governance of towns and villages
 gramshasan ke liye graamic, mahattar evam bhojak uttaradaayi hote the
 The capital of Chandragupta was Pataliputra
 kintu parvarti kuntalanareshon ke abhilekhon main use patlipurvaradhishwar evam ujjayinipurvaradhishwar donon kaha he
 It is quite possible that after the defeat of Shaka Rudrasinh, Chandragupta made Ujjayini the second capital of the kingdom of Hapna
 sahityagranthon main vikramaditya ko bhi in donon hi nagaron se sambhddha kiya gaya he
 Only after the victory of Ujjayini would Malav Samvat be associated with the name of Vikramaditya and started being named as vikram-samvat

 Describing Madhya Pradesh, Fahyan has written that people plow the king's land and give a part of the produce to the king in the form of rent

 Microbes are electromagnetic waves with wavelengths between 1 meter to 1 millimeter

 This definition broadly encompasses both trans high frequency and extremely high frequency

 Microwave spectrum usually consists of waves from 1 ghz to 1,000 ghz, but in some definitions frequencies less than 1 ghz are also called microwaves
 microwave ke adhikansh anuprayog 1 se 40 ghz

 In the table below, the microwave is divided into different bands: vaastaviktaa or uske nirupan ke bich kaa anupaat ko paimaana kehete hai
 It does not have a unit and is expressed as a fraction or a multiplier
 maanchitr par paimaana kaa arth he, maanchitr par darshaye gayi do binduon or unke sangat dharatleey jagahon ke bich duriyon kaa anupaat
 Template: This article needs to be spelled correctly maapak dharaatal ke kinhi do biduon ke bich kii vaastavik duuri tathaa maanchitr par darshit unheen do binduon ke bich kii duuri kaa anupaat he
 In simple words, it can be said that the ratio of the distance between the surface and the map is called a measure

 There are three methods of showing the scale on the map - kathanamak vadh Different viewer method iii) aalekhi yaa raikhik vidhi In this method, the scale is measured by speaking or saying words such as 1
 m = 1 meter or 1 inch = 2 miles, ie 1 cm on the map
 m a is equal to 1 meter of the far surface or 2 miles of 1 inch distance on the map
 yah sabase saral vadh he yak saadhaaran padhaa lakha yit bhi ise samaj kar dooray k gananaa kar saktaa he
 But the use of this method is limited, as this measurement can be read only in the country where the measure is run
 dashak bhan vadh :yah sanyaamak maapak he jasm maapak ek bhan ke pa m dashaya jaataa he
 The fraction of it cuts the distance of the map and the actual distance of each surface
 bhan ke ansh kaa maan hameshaa 1 ikai hota he jaise - ek maanach k dashak bhan 1 / 100, 000 he to maanach k ek ikai dharaatal k 100,000 ikai ke baraabar he
 This method has the maximum use because in any country from any decade there can be remote distances from the measurement system there
 aalekhi vadh : ise raikhak maapak bhi kehete ha
 In this, the unit is cut in a straight line by dividing it into primary and secondary part and writing unit number
 is maapni ke maanach ke vavadhan evam laghukaran yaa m maapak bhi vat: parwatat ho jaataa he
 The graphical scale consists of five types
 saadhaaran maapak tulanaamak maapak kanavat maapak vanayar maapak evam ay maapak
 In the method of measurement, mutual change is called the measurement of measurement which is done as follows
 kathanamak maapak ko dashan bhan m badalane ke lae savatham maanach va dharaatal k dooray ke anupaat ko ek ha ikai m badal kar ansh ko 1 ikai banaate ha tathaa ikai samaan hone par use dashak bhan m lakh dete ha jaise - 1se

 Therefore, decade = 1: 63000 1 inch = 1 mile 1 inch = 1 x 63360 inch

 Assuming in units, the denominator is written and converted into a larger unit of the same scale as 1: 100 by 1 cm

 After the dissolution of the Russian Empire in 1917, the first autonomous and later independent Moldovian Democratic Republic was formed, which in 1918 merged with Greater Romania
 1940 main bessarabia par soviet sangh ne kabja kar ukrainian esasaaar or navnirmit moldovian esasaaar main vibhakt kar diya

 The term girlfriend may be used in a non-marital romantic relationship to refer to a female partner, or to a closer non-romantic female friend than to other friends
 is shabd kii koi spasht paribhaasha nahin he or garlfriend ke vaastavik arth ko lekar bahes abhi bhi jari he
 In Western society it is generally believed that "girlfriend" status begins when two people agree to dating
 kisi ladki ko iske liye sahamat karvaa lenaa yuvakon ke liye kaaphi badi uplabdhi maani jaati he or uske saathiyon ke bich us ladki kii chhavi ke aadhaar par ise ek behatar str ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 According to some people, the difference between "girlfriend" and "girl Friend", or "boyfriend" and "boy Friend", though quite subtle but also very important
 
 yadi vishuddh vyakaranik rup main dekhen, to "garlfriend" yaa "boyfriend" vah vyakti he jiske saath aapkaa romantic rishta he
 Whereas a "girl friend" or "boy friend" is just a friend who is identified by her gender
 kai baar keval "ledifrend" yaa "gayafriend" kahkar bhi is paribhaasha kaa ulanghan kiya jaataa he
 The words "friend girl" are also often used for intimate friendship
 in donon ke bich kaa parivartan kishoravastha vikaas kaa ek mahatvapurn pahalu he
 Despite this, both "girlfriend" and "girl friend" are used by different people for different meanings
 udhaaharan ke liye, jab kisi ladki yaa mahila dwaara "garlfriend" shabd kaa prayog kisi gaiyr-yonik tathaa gaiyr-romantic sandarbh main kisi anya stri ke liye kiya jaataa he, tab yon sambandh athwa romantic arth ke saath bhramit hone se bachane ke liye kabhi-kabhaar iske do shabdon vaale rup "girl friend" kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, haalaanki aisa koi niyam nahin he
 This method of use of the term "girlfriend" is used for close friends and does not include any sexual relations, unless it is being used for lesbian, bi-sexual, or pan-sexual women The term "girlfriend" is also used in LGBT communities and can indicate any gender or sexuality
 koi jaruri nahin he ki "garlfriend" shabd yon sambandh kii taraf hi ishaara kare, lekin iskaa prayog aksar aisi mahila ke liye kiya jaataa he jo kisi purush ke saath dating kar rahi he lekin uske saath uski sagaai nahin hui he; lekin iskaa arth yah nahin nikalataa he ki unka aapas main yon sambandh he
 Due to differing expectations of sexual activity, the term dating may refer to romantic activity, while using only the word "friend" can be avoided to indicate intimacy
 yah multah "sweetheart" shabd ke samatuly he, jise lagaav ke arth main bhi istemaal kiya jaataa he
 a similar but incompatible and more ambiguous term is "lady friend" - a partner of the female gender whose status is probably less than a girlfriend but more than a friend
 arthath, yah aavashyak nahin he ki sambandh apni charam seemaa tak pahunch chukaa he or na hi yah ek anany, gambhir, patibaddh, yaa dirghakaalik rishta bana he
 Nevertheless, the term refrains from displaying openly revealing sex when a woman calls someone "mistress" or "lover"
 is sandarbh main, yah aksar ek vyanjana ke rup main ho saktaa he
 However, this is not always the case: it is often used even when a person does not know precisely the level of the woman concerned with a man
 udhaaharan ke liye, akhbaaron kii surkiyon main aksar likhaa jaataa he ki ek celibrity ko ek nayi "ladi friend" ke saath dekha gaya he
 "lady friend" can also be used to denote a romantic relationship with an age-old woman, since the word "girl" of "girlfriend" does not fit here by age

 The emission theory follows the relativity principle since there is no principal directive mechanism for light transmission, but these principles take the velocity of light emitted light relative to the source in place of anomalously captured

 This system was proposed by De Sitter to examine emission principles: yahan c prakaash kaa veg, v strot kaa veg, c′ prakaash kaa parinami veg he or k ek niyatank he jiskaa maan 0 se 1 ke madhya ho saktaa he or yah strot ke kshatra par nirbhar karata he
 According to the specific relativity principle and stable ether, k = 0, while according to the emission principle, this value can be up to 1

 Daniel Frost Comstocke and William de Sitter wrote in 1910 that the two-star theory seems to be correct, the light emitted from a nearby star must move faster than the light emitted from its companion and move beyond it

 Frustrated that his story is so difficult to explain, Lucas wrote a 13-page short article titled Star Wars, a light-hearted remake of Akira Kurokha's The Hidden Fortress

 For the second draft, Lucas made a number of simplifications and also introduced the boy as Luke
 anakin ek budhimaan jedy nite ke rup main ljuk kaa pita bana
 Force was also introduced as a supernatural force
 agle masaude ke praaroop main pita ke kirdaar ko hataakar vikalp ke rup main ben kenobi ke naam se rakh diya gaya or san 1976 main pradhan photography ke liye chauthaa masauda taiyaar kiya gaya
 The film was named Adventures of Luke Star Killer, taken from the Journal of Wheels, Saga i The Star Wars
 nirmaan ke dauraan, lucas ne luk kaa naam skywanker kar diya or film ko sheershak ko sirf da star wars or ant main keval star wars kar diya
 At this stage, Lucas did not expect that the film would become part of a series
 The fourth draft of the script underwent some subtle changes, making it an even more satisfying film in its own right, ending with the demolition of the entire empire through the demise of the Death Star
 haalanki, lucas ne film ke bare main dussahasik karnaamon kii ek series ke rup main hi kalpana kii thi 
 baad main, usne yah mahasoos kiya ki vastav main anukram kii yah pehali film nahin hogi, balki aakhyaan main dwitiya trayee hogi
 It is discussed in detail in George Lucas' preface on the 1994 republishing of Splinter of the Mind's Eye

 Soon Lucas met with writer Elaine Dean Foster, he tied up with him to write novels on the remaining two episodes of the North
 aisa iraadaa tha ki agar star wars safal hui to lucas un upanyaason ke aadhaar par patakatha likh sakegaa
 By then, he too had developed a fairly wide-spread backstory to aid his writing process
 jab star wars safal sabit ho gaya, lucas ne film kaa upyog lambey serial ke nirmaan ke liye karne kaa nishchay kiya, haalanki ek mode par usne puri tarah shrunkhlaa se prasthaan kar lene kaa faisla kar liya tha
 However, Lucas wanted to create an independent film production center — which could have been Sky Walker Ranch — and he had the chance to use the series as an agent to finance

 Initially, Lucas first envisioned series of films without the number of fixed series, just like the James Bond series
 agast 1977 main roling stone ke saath ek saakshaatkaar main, unhone kaha ki ve chaahate the ki unke har ek mitra baari-baari se filmon kaa nirdesan karen or series ko ek abhinav arthvatta pradaan karen
 He also said that the backstory of the story where Darth Vader turns on the bad side, kills Luke's father and is in a clash with Ben Kenawi on a volcano, and in the meantime the Gangetic Republic collapses All of these together will form an excellent answer story
 tatpashchaat usee varsh, lucas ne vigyaan katha lekhak ley bracket ko star wars II likhane ke liye apane saath anubandhit kiya
 By the end of November 1977 he held a story conference, in which Lucas presented a handwritten brief called The Empire Strikes Back
 yah rachana film ke antimrup ke kaaphi anuroop thi keval us ghatana ko chhodkar jab daarth vadeyr yah khulaasa nahin karata he ki vah luk kaa pita he
 In the first draft from where Brackett will begin writing, Luke's father appears to instruct Luke 
 bracket ne 1978 ke aarambh main hi apana pehla praaroop taiyaar kar liya; lucas ne kaha ki isse ve niraash hue hai, lekin isse pehle ki ve iske bare main uske saath vichaar-vimarsh karte, vah cancer se mar gayi
 With no writer available, Lucas had to write another format himself
 It was in this format that Lucas first used the term "episode" to refer to the number of series of films that had Empire Strikes Back Episode II on its list
 jaisaa ki maaikel kaminsaki ne da sikret history of star wars ke bare main tark pesh karte hue, pehle praaroop par apni niraashaa prakat kii he shaayad isi kaaran lucas ko kahani ko duusari disha main mode dene par vichaar karnaa padaa
 unhone kathanak ko ek nayaa mode diya: daarth vadeyr ljuk ke pita hone kaa daawa karata hai
 According to Lucas, he enjoyed writing this format, as it was in stark contrast to the writing of the years' struggle for the first film, and he soon wrote two more by April 1978
 unhone patakatha ko andhere kii antim seemaa tak pahunchaa diya jab ve hain solo karbonite ke kaid kar kudakhana jaise karagaar main chhod dete he
 This new stage of the story, in which Darth Vader revels as Luke's father, exerts a strong influence on the series
 maaikel caminsaki ne apni pustak main yah daleel di he ki aisa nahin lagata ki shaayad hi 1978 se pehle kathanak ke is bindu par itani gambhirtha se vichaar kiya gaya ho athwa isaki kaalpanik avdhaaran bhi kii gai ho or isiilie pehali film ek vaikalpik kahani kii kadi ke tahat parichaalit ho rahi thi jahaan vadeyr ljuk ke pita se alag ho jaataa he, kathanak ke is vindu ke bare main 1978 se pehle koi bhi sandarbh uplabdh nahin he
 After writing the second and third formats of Empire Strikes Back that included this point, Lucas re-reviewed the new episode of the previous story that he composed; Anakin was a meritorious student of skywalker Ben Kenobi; He had a child named Luke but under the influence of Emperor Palpatine, he turned to the dark side
 Anakin battled with Ben Kenobi in the volcano and was also wounded, but was then revived as Darth Vader
 is bich jab tak ganraajya samrajya ban jaataa or vadeyr jedy shoorveeron ko khoj nikaalata kenobi ne ljuk ko tatuin naamak ek kaalpanik grih par chipa diya
 In place of this new episode of the previous story, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy, in which Empire Strikes Back would be transformed into Episode II in Episode II, the next format
 Lawrence Kasdan, who had just finished writing Raiders of the Lost Ark, was contracted to write the next format and also received additional support from director Irvine Karschner
 kasdan, karshanar or nirmaataa gairi kartz ko laga ki yah film behad gambhir or vyasak film ban gai he, jise nai gahari kaali kahani kii ruparekha se madad mili he or series ko pehali kahani kii halki-phulki sussahsik mul kathaon se viksit kii gai he
 When he started writing Episode VI in 1981, much had changed
 empire strix back kaa nirmaan kaaphi tanaavpurn or mahangaa tha, evam lucas kii apni nijee jindagi bhi bikhar rahi thi
 In an interview with Time magazine in May 1983, he vowed that he had nothing to do with the series anymore, feeling much more exhausted and no longer wanting to make any further Star Wars films
 lucas ke 1981 ke praathmik praaroop main daarth vadeyr ko luk par apane adhikaar ke liye pratidwandvita karata hua dikhaaya gaya tha - or duusare patakatha main, "sanshodhit praathmik praaroop" main, vadeyr ek sahanubhutisheel charitra ban gaya
 Lawrence Kasdan was once again assigned the responsibility and in these final formats, Vader's mask was removed
 charitra main yah badlaav "tragedy of daarth vadeyr" kii kahani kii kadi main ekaek oochaal pradaan karegaa jo purv bhaagon main antanirhit he
 After losing a long time of good luck in a divorce settlement in 1987, Lucas had no desire to return to Star Wars again and unofficially followed the sequel to The Return of the Jedi
 Canceled
 haalanki purvabhag jo kaaphi kuch viksit ho chukaa tha, unke man ko lubhaata rahaa
 After Star Wars once again became popular with the dark horse stream of humor and the trilogy of novels by Timothy Zahn, Lucas noticed that it still had a large audience
 unke bachche ab dhire-dhire bade hone lage the or CGI takanic ke dhamaake ke baad ve ab lautne or nirdesan dene ke bare main vichaar karne lage the
 By 1993, it was announced, with Variety citing other sources, that they would build the precinct
 unhone kahani kii ruparekha taiyaar kerani shuru kar di, ab is baat ke sanket milane lage ki anakin skywanker ke buraai kii ore kaayantaran kii pariksha se guzarane ke kaaran series traasad hogi
 Lucas also began to make some changes to some of the story so that the prequel's relative relationship with the original would be maintained
 pehle-pehle pichhali kahani ke purvabhag kii in kadiyon ko itihaas kii "khaali jagah ko bharne" ke rup main mana ja rahaa tha, taaki samanaantar athwa sparsharekhiy astitv bana rahe, kintu ab unhone dekha ki ve ab ek nai lambi kahani kii shuruyaat kar denge jo anakin ke bachapan se aarambh hogi or mrityu main jaakar samaapt hogi
 This was the final step towards converting the film's series into a "narrative"
 1994 main, lucas ne episod I: da bigining ke sheershak se pehali patakatha likhni shuru kii
 Along with the release of the film, Lucas announced that he would also be directing the next two and he started working on Episode II at the same time
 episod II kaa pehla praaroop pradhan photography se thik kai saptaah purv hi sampoorn ho gaya tha or lucas ne da yang indiana jones chronicals se ek lekhak jonathan helles ko praaroop ko parimarjeet karne ke liye anubandhit kar liya
 In a state of uncertainty about the title of the film, Lucas jokingly called the film "jar Jars Great Adventures"
 likhit rup se da empire strix back, lucas ne aarambhik taur par yah nishchay kiya tha ki lando kalrisian ek krintak tha or chlons vaale grah se aayaa tha jiske kaaran "clon wars" hue the jiskaa ullekh kenobi ke dwaara a new hope main kiya gaya he; baad main unhone clon kii puri sena-vahini kii vaikalpik avadharana prastut kii jo grah se aae the jisane ganraajya par hamalaa kar diya or jedy ran bankuron ke dwaara peeche khaded di gaye
 These basic elements of the previous narrative became the cornerstone of the Episode II plot, adding additional new secret information that the entire event was Palpatine's personal running plan
 yahaan tak ki atake of da chlons ke release se pehle hi lucas ne episod III ko lekar kaam karnaa shuru kar diya saath hi pariklpana ke kalakaaron ko vishesh soochna dete hue ki film kii shuruyaat saat clon yuddh ke film sangrathan se hogi
 As he reviewed the story's outline that summer, though he says he has made a radical change in the plot
 da sikret history of star wars main maaikel kaminsaki, pramaan prastut karte hai ki anakin ke andhere paksh main patan ke muddon ne lucas ko kahani main amul parivartan ke liye baadhya kar diya, pehla to udghaatan vaala drishy jisamen palpatin kaa apharan karnaa or duku ko anakin ke dwaara maar diya janaa baad vaale ke andhere paksh kii ore mud jane main pehla drishy tha
 After the main cinematography was completed in 2003, Lucas made many major changes to Anakin's character by rewriting his turn to the completely dark world; Now he will first turn to the quest to save Padmi from death, not as in the previous version, which included one of several reasons that he actually believed that the Jedi were evil and conspired to capture the republic
 Was planning is moulik punarlekhan kaa kaary sampadan or pramukh footage donon ke jariye sampann hua or ab naye sanshodhit drishyon ko san 2004 ke teji se filmakan ke dauraan filmaaya gaya
 Whatever facts Lucas presented for the series was often exaggerated; Much of which resulted from the post-1978 period when the series turned into a significant event
 maaikel kaminsaki ne savistaar samajhaayaa ki ye atishyoktiyaan prachaar or suraksha donon ke hi liye upaay hai
 Giving a logical explanation, Kaminski said that since the series has changed completely over the years
 isliye lucas kaa abhipraay mul kahani ko purvaprabhavi tareeke se parivartit karnaa rahaa kyonki darshak tathy ko keval apane hi najariye se dekhenge
 At a 2005 showwest conference, Lucas demonstrated new technology and stated that he planned to air six films in the new 3-D format; Which started in 2007 with a New Hope
 haalanki janvari san 2007 ke aasapaas, lucasfilm ne starwars

 europe main july san 2007 ke ek utsav samaaroh main, rik macelem ne yah pushti kii ki lucasfilm "sabhi chah filmon ko lekar 3-D main badal dene kii yojana he", lekin ve "un companiyon ke saamne aane kaa intjaar kar rahen hai jo aisi takanic viksit kar rahe hai taaki laagat ke str ko kam kar saken jisase ki har kisi ke liye yah sarthak ho saken
july n 2008 main jeffri katjemberg, dreamworks anemation ke mukhya kaaryakari adhikari ne yah khulaasa kiya ki jorge lucas sabhi chah filmon ko punah 3-D main bana rahe hai
 Lucas has indicated in the past that he will air the decisive versions of six Star Wars films in the future on the next-generation home-video format
 There have been discussions that we will use this opportunity to make any kind of final adjustments, changes, additions and / or any kind of subtraction in the film before the final broadcast
 The altered clip of The Phantom Men accommodated a feature of the DVD release of Revenge of the Sith that featured a computerized Yoda removing the original puppet; Animation director Rob Coleman said that Kilp was created just before the program of Revenge of the Sith, to mark Yoda's trial

 In spite of no theoretical differences, the classification of the devoid has been done mainly on two grounds
 pratham prakaar ke vargeekaran kaa aadhaar he, doorabeen urdhv samtal main puraa chakkar kaat sakati he yaa nahin
 The second basis of classification is the facility to read the fraction-fraction of the inscribed circle in the instruments, such as the Vernier deconomial, in which the vernier scale is used to read the division fraction of the circle; Micrometer theodolite, which uses micrometer screws to read portions; Glass arc theodolimeters, which have inscribed circles of glass and arrange the optical facility to bring the reflection of the arcs read to the observer
 varneer theodolite hi sabase puraani kalpana he
 The inscribed circles of the old Vikhonmas were of large diameter, so that skilled craftsmen could make a proper division on them

 Jurisprudence or jurisprudence is the theory of law, study and philosophy
 isamen samast vidhik siddhanth sammilit hai, jo kanoon banaate hai
 Jurisprudence scholars, also known as jurists or legal theorists, hope to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of law, legal reasoning, legal systems and legal institutions
 vidhi ke vigyaan ke rup main vidhishastra, vidhi ke bare main ek vishesh tarah kii khojbin he
 In the ordinary sense, all statutory principles are inherent in jurisprudence
 vidhishastra "jurisprudence" arthath Juris = vidhaan, Prudence = gyaan
 In this sense all the books of law are books of law
 is prasang main kanoon kaa ekmaatr arth hota he desh kaa saadhaaran kanoon, jo un niyamon se sarvatha pruthak he, jinhen kanoon se saadrishy rahane ke kaaran kanoon kaa naam diya jaataa he
 If we use the word science in its more and more comprehensive form in which knowledge of any subject of intellectual research is known, then we can say that jurisprudence is the science of general law of the country
 pracheenatam bhartiya vidhishastra dharamshastra ke anek paathon main maujuud hai, jaise kii bodhayan kaa dharamshastra
 The law has equal rights for providing emotional support to human beings and for the proper consumption of the amenities provided by nature
 vidhi dwaara maanviya hit main sangrakshit yah vidha hi "prakritik vidhi" kahi jaati he
 Alpine - "knowledge of divine and human things, science of fair and improper things" vidhishastra teen shakhaon main vibhakt he- The objective of statutory representation is to present the fact of the system of any proposed method, whether it is present or in the past
 vaidhanik itihaas kaa uddeshy he us aitihaasik prakriya ko upasthit karnaa jisase koi kanoon pranali viksit hui he yaa hui thi
 The purpose of the doctrine of law is to present the law - not the law which is present or was in the past, but rather the law which is appropriate to be according to the country, time, vessel
 vidhishastra ko kisi vaidhanik pranali ke vartmaan yaa bhoot se apeksha nahin he, yah iske adarshamay bhavishya se sambhddha he
 Jurisprudence theory has three parts - analytical jurisprudence, historical jurisprudence, and moral jurisprudence
 vishleshnatmak shakha main krambaddh vaidhanik siddhant ke darshanik athwa saamaanya vichaar hote hai; aitihaasik shakha main vaidhanik itihaas kaa darshanik athwa saamaanya bhaag hota he; naitik shakha main vidhannirmaan ke darshanik siddhant rahete hai
 But these three branches are inter-related
 at: inhen ek duusare se pruthak kar inpar vichaar nahin kar sakate
 See, Analytical Jurisprudence vishleshnatmak vidhishastra kaa uddeshy hota he - 'vidhaan ke moulik siddhanton kaa vishleshan'
 It is necessary to consider their historical origin, development, moral sense or belief in this context
 iske antargat nimnlikhit vishay aate hai- Originally related to the origin and development of simple principles of legislation
 jin sroton se desh kaa saadhaaran vidhaan prabhavit hota he, ve bhi isaki seemaa ke antargat he
 In other words, it is a history of the basic principles of legislation and the spirit of their method
 naitik vidhishastra, vidhaan kii vivechna naitik ganbhiry evam isaki purnataa kii drushti se karata he
 The intellectual element of the system of law or its historical development has no purpose
 vidhaan ke uddeshy evam kis seemaa tak tathaa kis rup main isaki purti hoti he, yahi iskaa vishay he
 Generally, its goal and purpose is to follow justice by the physical power of the state under a political firm
 at: naitik vidhishastra yah dekhtaa he ki nyaay ke siddhant kaa vidhaan se kahan tak sambandh he
 It is the meeting point of moral and legal philosophy
 apane saamaanya rup main nyaay, naitikta athwa naitik darshan se sambhddha he
 Justice, in its particular form, is associated with that branch of legal philosophy as the last line of law of the country, which is called moral jurisprudence
 isaki paridhi ke antargat saamaanya: nimnlikhit vishay aate hai- See, comparative jurisprudence sansar ke bhinn bhinn deshon main vidhishastra kii paribhaasha kinchit bhinn bhinn roopon main kii gai he
 Motomoti is a synonym for legislative law in Germany, which aims at scientific study
 france ke vidhaan main isse nyaayalay ke kshetradhikaar kaa bodh hota he, jo kanoon ke "code" kii vikruti ev vikaas karata he
 English and American are embedded in legislation
 sanathan bhartiya vidhaan main vidhishastra dharamshastra par aadhaarit he
 "dharma" is defined as the following- arthath veda, smriti, sadachaar evam suniti dharm ke udgam hai
 "religion" is the broad term
 dharmik, naitik, saamaajik evam vaidhanik drushti se yah manushya ke kartavya evam daayitv kii samshti he
 The dividing line between religious and secular feeling cannot be established, because there are so many subjects which are both religious and worldly
 bharat kaa sanathan dharm raja athwa shaasha ke aadesh par aadhaarit nahin he
 Its belief is embedded in it
 smritikaron or unke purvajon ne kaha he ki "dharm bhagwaan kii dein he
 It is the king of kings
 isse adhik shaktishaalee doosraa koi nahin
 With its help, even the powerless can take their authority from the powerful
 raja nyaay kaa nirmaataa nahin, keval iskaa paalak he
 " vidhivetta austin kinwa bentham ke siddhant ke anusaar sanathan dharm kaa adhikansh naitikta main sannivisht ho jayega, kyonki yah "dharm" kisi raja athwa saarvbhaum sattaprapt shaasha kaa aadesh nahin he
 It is true that Smriti is not a law of its own, as neither the legislature nor the state declared it
 par yah jas receptom ke siddhant par maanya tha arthath samaaj ne ise grahan kar liya tha
 Therefore, according to one belief, the origin of the law of memory is society
 iskaa ek ansh naitik aadesh he, jiskaa strot naiysargik mana gaya he evam avshesh parampara evam sadachaar he
 Recognition of the words of memory is the authority of their statutory injunction, being based on the personality and respect of the memorialists and Suniti
 kautilya ke arthshaastra ke pramanik sanskaran prakashit hone par yah vivaad uth khadaa hua ki bharat main rajanirmit vidhaan dharamshastra dwaara ghoshit vidhaan se kisi samay adhik maanya tha yaa nahin
 Kautilya has said that the legislation is based on four pillars - inamen parvarti aadhaar kramagat purv ke aadhaar se adhik shaktishaalee he kintu yah smaraneey he ki rajashilaalekh dwaara dharamshastra main kathith kisi bhi moulik aadesh athwa vyavhaar kaa ulanghan nahin hua
 Kautilya also admitted in principle that the legislative legislation is not outside the purview of theology
 dekhen, vidhik samajashaastra In the early 19th century, the French philosopher Augusta Kont named the term sociology
 samajashaastra sthool rup se samaaj kaa adhyayan he
 Legislation is also included in the study of a sociologist but is different from his point of view
 vakil, adhivaktaa yaa nirnaayak ke rup main, un niyamon ko dekhtaa he jinhen sarsaadhaaran ko anukaran karnaa chahie
 The sociologist observes what these rules are
 kuch had tak donon saath chal sakate hai, kyonki vastav main ye niyam vaanchit charitra ke dyotak hai
 But the sociologist is more keen in the actual character, not in the idea of the desired character
 vaidhanik samajashaastra ko aparaadhashastra bhi kehete hai
 It studies all of these because of the crimes, the character of the criminals, the impact of various types of punishments on criminals - especially the extent to which the punishment is reduced by crime
 isse kanoon ke sudhaar main suvidha hoti he
 According to Samand, the study of jurisprudence has its own unique interest, due to which it can be compared to a branch of serious knowledge
 vastav main anumaan or siddhanth kaa prakritik aakarshan hota he
 Forensic research influences legal, political, social, etc
 ideas, so the study of jurisprudence is important
 vidhishastra kaa adhyayan maanav ke chintan manan kii prakharata m vruddhi karata he
 According to Dias, this gives the law and the right to the theory and life of life as it considers human ideas in relation to social science
 vidhik avadharanaon ke taarkik vishleshan se vidhivettaon kii taarkik paddati kaa vikaas hota he
 From this, the evil of the legalistic commercialism of the jurist can be overcome
 diase ne mana ki vidhishastra vidhi main jeevandaayee kaa vikaas kar adhyeta main pratibha nikhaar kii anuprerna detaa he
 JG Fillmore has clarified that the science of jurisprudence is so high that its knowledge makes its scholar enter life with knowledgeable concepts and impulses that can be applied to all expectations that arise in human conditions
 laski ne vidhishastra ke mahatv kaa moolyankan karte hue ise ‘vidhi kaa netra’ kaha he
 The way to solve the increasing intricacies of the law and the complexities of human relations can be found in the study of jurisprudence
 isiilie ise vidhi kaa vyakaran mana gaya he
 According to Anirudh Prasad, conscious study of the legal system must solve social problems and make sense of justice
 vartmaan jail sudhaar, kaidiyon ke saath maanviya vyavhaar kii apeksha, maanav garima ke saath jeene k adhikaar ke saath soshal ection litygeshan tathaa lok hit vaadon kaa anveshan naveen vidhishastreey drushtikon se hi upja he
 Likewise, environmental reform law, free legal aid for the poor, etc
 The interdisciplinarity of jurisprudence and other social sciences is a product of exchange of knowledge and mutual effects
 vidhishastra vidhi kii vibhinn shakhaon kii moolbhoot sankalpanaaon ke saiddhanthik aadhaaron kaa hi gyaan nahin karaata he balki unke antarsambandhon kaa bhi gyaan karaata he
 Jurisprudence does not only administer justice through the legal system, but through the discovery of new principles, ideas and other routes, it helps in establishing a just society
 ant main, vidhishastra se hamen us adhyayan, shodh evam anumaan kaa bodh hota he, jinka praathmik lakshya sarsaadhaaran ke prashn


"kanoon kya he"? kaa uttar dena hota he
 In the eyes of the jurist, law is the set of influences by which decisions are rendered in courts
 kanoon kaa pratham lakshya he saamaajik dwandvon kaa niraakaran, yadhyapi sab prakaar ke dwandv is seemaa ke andar nahin aate
 According to jurist Rusco Pound, the work of law is to balance the mutual rights of the people, so that every person gets the maximum and has to sacrifice minimum for the benefit of society
 dhruviya jyoti, yaa merujyoti, vah romantic deeptimay chata he jo dhruvakshetron ke vayumandal ke upree bhaag main dikhaai padati he
 The polar light of northern latitudes is called Sumeru Jyoti, or North Polar Light, and the Polar Light of Southern Latitudes is called Kumeru Jyoti, or South Polar Light
 pracheen romavaasiyon or unaniyon ko in ghatnaon kaa gyaan tha or unhone in drishyon kaa behad rochak or vistrut varnan kiya he
 The South Hemisphere has not described the Kumeru Jyoti for as wide and interesting a description as the Sumeru Jyoti has done by the Northern Hemisphere

 Vegord classifies Jyoti as calm and movable

 Samang arc HA - Their boundaries are clear enough

 3
 Pulsant arc PA - They disappear in a few seconds by pulsing and flaring

 Pulsant PS or Pulsed DS diffused lamp page - It looks like a bright cloud of uncertain size and clear boundaries
 9
 durbal dipti ji - yah kshitij ke nikat chaap ke upree bhaag main ushakal ke samaan prathit hoti he
 Structured or structureless arcs, platens and perpendiculars are more common in the various types of lights described above, while the pulsating surface and rays are much less visible

 There Yadav dynasty was ruled by a king named Vijayapala
 uski patni kaa naam padmasen tha
 The daughter of both of them was Padmavati

 At that time a shook was seen by him
 vah shuk atyant aakarshak tha
 The Shuk also considered Padmavati's blood balance as a bimble fruit and proceeded to eat it
 usee samay padmavati ne shuk ko apane haath main grahan kiya
 He was a scholar of human language
 vah padmavati kaa manoranjan karne ke liye anek katha sunaata rahaa
 After that, Padmavati curiously asked Shuk, "O Shukraj, where do you live? Who is the king of your kingdom?" Then Shuk began to describe his kingdom and Prithviraj in detail to eradicate the curiosity of Padmavati

 On hearing the praise of Prithviraj from the mouth of Shuk, Yadav Kumari Padmavati's mind became attached to Prithviraj
