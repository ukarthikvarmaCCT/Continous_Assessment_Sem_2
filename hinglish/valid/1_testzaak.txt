au Houyi took the pill home and hid it under a manjhi articleid
 One day, Houyi was called away again by Emperor Yao
 During her husband's absence, Chang'e, noticed a white beam of light pointing from the rafter and discovered the bullet
 Chang'e swallowed him and immediately realized that he could fly
 Houyi ghar laut aae, saakaar kya hua tha vah apni patni fatkaar laga
 Chang'e baahar akaash main udaan khidki se bhaag nikle
 Houyi was driven halfway across the sky, but was forced to return to Earth due to strong winds
 Chang'e chandramaa, vah kahan tak goli kaa hissaa fees bhari pahunch Chang'e khargosh ajna di ki chand par rahane ke liye ek or goli he
 
 Chang'e will then be able to return to Earth and her husband: Need for citation

 Houyi khud dhoop main ek mahal banaaya, kaa pratinidhitiv " yang" jo chaand " yin" kaa pratinidhitiv karata he par Chang'e ghar ke liye iske vipareet main,

 The second version of the legend, similar to the one above, is saying that Chang'e swallowed the pill of immortality because Peng, a Houyi of several trainee archers, is different in trying to force him to shoot her
 
 jaanate hue bhi ki vah band peng nahin lard saktaa he, Chang'e koi chaara nahin balki khud goli nigal tha saanchaa:prashasti patr kii jarurat Other versions say that Houyi and Chang'e still live in heaven at the time that Houyi nine immortals of the Sun
 Houyi and Chang'e were the sons of punishment by the sun birds Jade Emperor, who forced them to live on Earth as humans
 dekh rahaa he ki Chang'e atyant amarta kii use nuksaan par dukhi mahasoos kiya, Houyi ko goli he ki ise behaal hoga khojane kaa faisla kiya
 At the end of his hunt, he meets the Queen Mother of the West, who agreed to give him the shot, but warns him that each person will only need one half of the shot to achieve immortality
 Houyi brought the pill home and stored it in a case
 He warned Chang'e not to open the case and then left home for a while
 Like Pandora in Greek mythology, Chang'e became inquisitive
 He opened the case and found the bullet, just as Houyi was returning home
 nervas ki Houyi use pakadaney ke liye, cese kii saamagree kii khoj karenge, vah galati se puure goli nigal karne ke liye or adhik maatra kii vajah se aasmaan main naav shuru kar diya
 Some versions of the legend do not refer to Houyi or Chang'e as being previously immortal and initially require them instead of humans as current mortals
 vahaan bhi kahani ke sanskaran jisamen Houyi nau surya kii maut ho gai or logon ko bachaane ke liye ek inaam ke rup main raja banaaya gaya tha
 However, King Houyi became a dictator who either stole the pill of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West or learned that he could make such a pill every night for a hundred nights by grinding the body of a different teenage boy
 Chang'e stole the pill and swallowed it herself, either to stop more boys being killed or her husband's tyrannical mold from lasting forever: the citation needed to stop the rule

 har subah jab sanjay shauchalay jaataa he, vah vaash basin main nal kii tonti ke paas hi "kameez utaaro" likhaa hua ek note dekhtaa he
 As he takes off the shirt, he sees a series of tattoos on his wide chest
 jab vah "kalpana kii hatya kar di gai thi" guda hua dekhtaa he to ek sire se yah udghaatit ho jaataa he ki sanjay antat kalpana kii hatya kaa badla lene ke liye pra tibaddh he or isiilie vah pariklpit tareeke se ek-ek kar un logon ko maar rahaa he jo kalpana kii maut ke jimmedaar the

 aakhirkaar yah bhi saafe-saafe jaahir ho jaataa he ki gajani or koi nahin balki shahar kaa ek prasiddh saamaajik vyaktitv he
 Mumbai Police Inspector Arjun Yadav is involved in the investigation of the case related to serial murders
 vah sanjay kaa pataa lagaate hue use uske flats main khoj nikaalte hai or usapar hamalaa kar use apahiz kar dete hai
 Arjun Yadav is surprised to see the extensive set of photographs and written notes
 unhen aisi do diariyaan milteen hai jinamein 2005 or 2006 kii ghatnaon ko kram se lipibaddh kiya gaya he
 The film enters the pre-2005 scene as soon as Inspector Yadav reads the 2005 diary
 sanjay singhania ek pratishthit vyapaaree vansh kaa vyakti he jo air voyas telephone company kaa maalik he
 He has finished his education abroad and returned to take over his family business
 apane kaarobaar ke dauraan sanjay apane karmchaariyon ko ek jujharu abhinetri / model kalpana se milane evam uske apartment ke upar air voyas kaa vishaal vigyaapan board lagane ke bare main baatcheet karne ke liye bhejtaa he
 The owner of Kalpana's modeling / advertising company forgets to think of it as a romance affair and encourages Kalpana to accept the proposal
 vah pramukh model ke rup main uski padonnati kar detaa he
 Kalpana is usually sweet and kind
 vah ise bataur ek maasoom sharaarat karne ke liye sweekaar kar leti he or is prakaar sanjay ke garlfriend ke rup main paheliyon se bharaa naatakeey khel shuru karti he
 Sanjay finally meets Kalpana but he tells him that he is Sachin and is an Adana human who has come from a small town to a big city in search of new life
 kalpana use modling ke chote-mote kaam dilaati he
 Slowly she is drawn towards him in his hypnosis and Sachin also gets swept away in her mildness, simplicity and compassion
 unhen ek duusare se pyaar ho jaataa he or sanjay ko antat usase shaadi kaa prastaav pesh karne kii himmat ho jaati he
 She asks for some time to consider his proposal
 sanjay sthir karata he ki agar vah uske prastaav ko sweekaar kar leti he to vah apni asli pahchaan uske saamne ujagar kar degaa; or agar vah asweekaar karti he, to vah chupchaap bina koi haani pahunchaae waapas laut jayega
 The film's story then returns to the present; When Yadav starts reading the 2006 diary
 sanjay achaanak aa jaataa he, yadav par hamalaa kar detaa he or use baandh detaa he
 He discovers Ghazni at a college function where he is the honorable head guest
 sanjay gajani ke kuch chayachitr letaa he or use jaan se maar daalane kaa faisla karata he 
 usee samaaroh main uski mulaaqaat sunita se ho jaati he; vah bhi uske file par lage cover se use pahchaan leti he or usase dosti karne kaa iraadaa karti he
 Later that same evening, Sanjay kills a goon of Ghazni in the parking area
 vah gajani ke aane kaa intjaar karne lagata he lekin ant main usapar phir kabhi kisi or maukey par aakhri hamalaa karne kaa faisla karata he
 The dying injured Gunda reminds Ghazni of an incident that took place two years ago in which Kalpana was murdered and Sanjay became a patient after being hurt
 gajani asamanjas main pad jaataa he or kuch bhi yaad kar paane main naakaam ho jaataa he
 Meanwhile, Sunita comes to Sanjay's flat and finds Yadav beaten and tied
 use is baat kaa pataa bhi lag jaataa he ki gajani hi sanjay kaa nishaanaa he
 Yadav also informs him that Sanjay is a known serial killer
 sunita ke haathon do diariyaan lag jaatin hai or vah yadav ko aaazaad kar detii he
 Suddenly in the meantime Sanjay reaches there He does not remember any of them and walks out chasing them
 antatogatva yadav ek bas se takaraa jaataa he or sunita badi mushkil se sanakee sanjay se batch nikalati he
 Knowing that Ghajni is in danger, she informs him that it is Sanjay who is behind his life
 is naam ko lakshya banaakar pataa lagaataa hua gajani sanjay ke flats main uski hatya ke iraade se pahunch jaataa he
 He destroys all her photographs and notes and gets her goons overpowered by Sanjay and re-inducts her on her existing tattoo so that all the marks that mark old memories are erased
 All traces connecting with old memories of being restless have been erased, leaving Gajni Sanjay in this condition
 is bich, chatravaas main lautakar sunita 2006 kii diary padhati he
 The film's story then returns to the pre-2006 scene
 aisa dikhaaya jaataa he ki kalpana ne sanjay ke vivaah prastaav ko sweekaar kar liya tha
 This diary also ends abruptly
 sunita or aage chaanbin kar pataa lagaati he or yah khoj nikaalati he ki 2006 main kisi padaav par kalpana anjaane main anachaahe hi veshyavriti karwaane waalon ke bure jaal main ulajh gai thi
 During the train journey, he met 25 innocent Bholi Bhali Kamsin girls who were being sent to Mumbai for business
 vah un ladakiyon kii raksha kar unka uddhaar karti he
 But the girls take Ghajni's name as gang gangsters
 gajani apane tareeke se apane madhyamon kaa prayog ladakiyon kii jubaan band karne ke liye karata he or kalpana ko khud khoj nikalne ke liye nikal padataa he
 Ghazni and his goons sabotage into Kalpana's apartment and wait for her to return while Kalpana is found inside
 sanyogvash, sanjay vahaan kalpana se milane pahunch gaya
 Kalpana's last pronounced word was "ghajini"
 The goons attacked Kalpana
 sanjay hastkshep karne hi vaala tha ki achaanak gajani ne lohe kii chad se uske sir par aghat kar diya
 The final scene flashes in front of Sanjay's eyes, that Kalpana was killed by the brutal assault of Ghazni's iron rod
 sunita ko ab sadma vaali sachai kaa pataa chal jaataa he, vah sanjay se mulaaqaat karti he or use bataati he ki sach kya he
 Uncontrollable with anger, he pursues Ghazni zealously
 mumbai main gajani kii maand main pahunchakar sanjay gajani ke sabhi anuchar gurgon ko ek-ek kar baqayada suniyojit dhang se krurtapurvak maar daalata he or gajani ke peeche pil padataa he
 Furiously repulsed, he approaches her and confronts the fight
 vah gajani ko maarna hi chahta he ki uskaa smriti lop chakra phir gum jaataa he or vah vartmaan ko bhul jaataa he
 Ghazni turns and stabs him
 vah sanjay kaa mazaaq udaate hue vibhats ghinauni kahani sunaata he ki usne kaise kalpana kii hatya kii thi, tabhi achaanak apni takat kaa antim ubaal paakar sanjay gajani ko kaabo main kar letaa he
 Sanjay kills Ghazni in the same way that Ghajni murdered Kalpana
 film apni samaapti kii ore badhati he, sanjay abhi bhi apni smriti-lop kii beemaari se grasit ek anathalay main swanyasevak ke rup main kaam kar rahaa he
 Sunita gives him a small gift that marks Sanjay and Kalpana's footsteps on the plaster plate when they entered a new apartment - only to remind him of his intimate companionship with Kalpana

 Middle-base Under the law of the sea, an exclusive economic zone is a seazone over which a state has special rights over the exploration and use of marine resources
 Generally a state's EEZ extends to a distance of 200 nautical miles out from its coast
 The exception to this rule occurs when eezs overlap; that is, state coastal baselines are less than 400 nautical miles apart
 When an overlap occurs, it is up to the states to delineate the actual boundary
 Otherwise, any point within an overlapping area defaults to the most proximate state
 The Exclusive Economic Zone starts at the coastal baseline and extends 200 nautical miles out into the sea, perpendicular to the baseline
 Thus, the EEZ overlaps both the contiguous zone and territorial waters
 This concept of allotting nations eezs to give better control of maritime affairs outside territorial limits gained acceptance in the late 20th century and was given binding international recognition by the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in 1982
 Part V, Article 55 of the Convention states: Fisheries management is a significant aspect of the resulting control
 Disputes over the exact extent of exclusive economic zones are a common source of conflict between states over marine waters
 Regions where a permanent ice shelf extends beyond the coastline are also sources of potential dispute
 1,159,063 km2 Australia has the third largest Exclusive Economic Zone, behind the United States and France, but ahead of Russia, with the total area actually exceeding that of its land territory
 As per UN convention, Australia's EEZ generally extends 200 nautical miles from the coastline of Australia and its external territories, except where a maritime delimitation agreement exists with another state
 Australia has also claimed, in its submission to the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, an EEZ of 200 nautical miles from its Antarctic Territory but has requested it not be considered, in accordance with the Antarctic Treaty
 Nevertheless, Australia maintains the right to explore and exploit the seabed and water column within its EEZ
 Source Canada is unusual in that its Exclusive Economic Zone, covering 2,755,564 km2, is slightly smaller than its territorial waters
 The latter generally extend only 12 nautical miles from the shore, but also include inland marine waters such as Hudson Bay, the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the internal waters of the Arctic archipelago
 The EEZ of the European Union is shared, so vessels or a national from one country can fish in another country's EEZ
 The combined zone amounts to 25 million km2, making it larger than the United States' zone, the largest of any single country
 '"see: Common Fisheries Policy
 Due to its numerous overseas départements and territories scattered on all oceans of the planet, France possesses the second-largest EEZ in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2, just behind the EEZ of the United States, but ahead of the EEZ of Australia 
 According to a different calculation cited by the Pew Research Center, the EEZ of France would be 10,084,201 km2, behind the United States, but ahead of Australia and Russia 
 The EEZ of France covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the eezs of the world, whereas the land area of the French Republic is only 0
45% of the total land area of the Earth
 Greece has not yet claimed an exclusive economic zone, although it is entitled to do so, as per UNCLOS 1982 as well as customary international law
 The reason for its inaction is the direct Turkish threat of casus belli
 Turkey's declaration of casus belli is not related to the EEZ issue
 Aegean Sea is a semi-closed sea which has a special nature
 Moreover, Turkey is not among the signatories of UNCLOS which allows countries to expand width of their territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles
 Besides, Turkey is a persistent objector to the relevant article of UNCLOS
 In 1995, just after Greece's ratification of UNCLOS, Turkey declared that if Greece expands the width of her territorial waters over 6 nautical miles, Turkey would conceive this action as a containment attempt and a direct offence to her sovereignty
 So, Turkish Parliament decided that if Greece attempts to expand the width of its territorial waters it would be a cause of war
 Portugal has the 3rd largest Exclusive Economic Zone of the EU and the 11th in the world
 764,071 km2 Japan has disputes over its EEZ boundaries with all its Asian neighbours 
 The above and relevant maps at the Sea Around Us Project both indicates Japan's claimed boundaries, and does not take into account neighbouring power's claims
 New Zealand's EEZ covers 4,083,744 km2, according to the Sea Around Us Project, which is approximately fifteen times the land area of the country
 Sources vary significantly on the size of New Zealand's EEZ; for example, a recent government publication gave the area as roughly 4,300,000 km2
 These figures are for the EEZ of New Zealand proper, and do not include the eezs of other territories in the Realm of New Zealand
 Norway has a large exclusive economic zone of 819 620 km2 around its coast
 The country has a fishing zone of 1,878,953 km2, including fishing zones around Svalbard and Jan Mayen
 The fact that the European Union shares its economic zones was a big reason why Norway did not entered the EU as a member

 If the program tries to access or reallocate memory that has already been reallocated, then the results become difficult to predict and interpret and the programs are likely either unstable and / or terminated
 ise smart sanketon ke istemaal se anshatah thik kiya ja saktaa he lekin yah uprivyay or jatilta ko badhaata he
 Garbage collection can occur at any time
 adarshatah yah tab hoga jab kaarykram khaali rahata he
 It is sure to run if there is insufficient free memory to allocate to the new object, which may cause a program to be installed momentarily
 spasht smriti prabandhan java main sambhav nahin he
 Java does not support c / c ++ style pointer arithmetic, where object addresses and unmarked integers can be used interchangeably
 yah kachra colector ko sandarbhit objectos ko sthanantarit karne kii anumati detaa he or iskaa bachaav or suraksha sunishchit karata he
 As in c ++ and some other object-oriented languages, Java's variable primary type is not an object
 praathmik prakaaron kii upyogita ko yaa to kshetron main pratyaksh rup se sanchit kiya jaataa he yaa dheron par naa ki steke par, jaisaa object ke liye saamaanya taur par sahi he 
 This was a conscious decision taken by Java's designers for demonstration
 iske kaaran, java ko ek shuddh object-unmukh programing bhashaa nahin mana gaya
 Whatever it is, as in Java 5
0, self-operation enables programmers to proceed if the primary types are instances of their wrapper ranges
 java ke vaakyavinyas zyaadaatar C++ se vyutpann he
 Unlike c ++, which combines design, methodology and program syntax, Java was created as an object-oriented language only
 sabhi code ek class ke bheetar likhe gaye hai or sabhi kuch ek object he; antarbhoot aakadon ke prakaaron ko chhodkar, jo pradarshan kaarnon se claason nahin he
 Java hides many features for classes, to simplify the language and to prevent natural errors and clutter
 java C++ kii tarah hi samiksha paddati upyog karti he
 There are two different types of reviews: single line style marking with two forward slashes and a multiline style open forward slash with asterisk and closed one asterisk with forward slash
 udhaaharan: Traditionally, helloworld
java is a public class naming of source files by applying the 
java suffix
 iskaa sankalan helloworld
class ke naam se file upadit karke sabase pehle java compiler kaa istemaal karke bitcode main hona chahie
 Only then can it be implemented or "executed"

 a class that has been declared private can be stored in any 
java file
 compiler strot file main paribhaashit har class ke liye ek class file utpann karegaa
 The name of the class file is the name of the class, with 
class attached
 For class file generations, unnamed classes are handled as if their name was a combination of their attached class name, a $, and an integer
 mukhya shabd public suchit karata he ki ek pranali duusare claason main code ke dwaara laayaa ja saktaa he, yaa class padanukram ke baahar claason ke dwaara class kaa prayog ho saktaa he
 The class hierarchy relates to the name of the directory in which the Java file resides
 ek pranali ke aage kaa mukhya shabd static ek sthitik pranali ko sanket karata he jo sirf class se judaa hua he, us class ke kisi bhi duusare vishesh udhaaharan se nahin
 Only positional systems can be invited without reference to an object
 sthitik pranaliyaan kisi bhi char pranali jo sthitik nahin he uskaa abhigam nahin kar saktin
 The word void indicates that the main system does not return any value to the caller
 If a Java program is to exit with the wrong code, it will explicitly call System
exit
 pranali naam "main" java bhashaa main mukhya shabd nahin he
 This is just the name of the system the Java Creator calls the program to extend control
 java claason jo prabandhit parivesh jaise applates or interprise java beans main chalate hai usko main pranali kii zarurat nahin padati hai yaa istemaal nahin karte

 The main system] docs / api / java / lang / String
html String] must accept a table of objects
 Traditionally, it is referred to as args although any legal identifying name can be used
 java 5 ke samay se, mukhya pranali ko string yuktiyon ke swechhachari sankhya ke saath aamantran ko anumati dete hue public static void main ke rup main, mukhya pranali parivartit yuktiyon kaa bhi istemaal kar saktaa he
 The effect of this optional declaration is semantically recognizable, but it allows alternative syntax to construct and extend the table
 java nirmaataa die gaye class ke bhaaran dwaara java kaa prakshepan karti he or apane public static void main pranali ko shuru karti he
 Stand-alone programs should declare this system explicitly

 Javadoc is a comprehensive documentation system, created by Sun Microsystems and used by many Java developers
 yah developers ko apane code ke dastavezikaran ke liye sangathit vyavastha pradaan karti he
 Wherever simple comments in Java and c end with / * and * / , multi-line comment tags, Javadoc comments have an extra asterisk at the beginning, thus tags are / ** and * /
