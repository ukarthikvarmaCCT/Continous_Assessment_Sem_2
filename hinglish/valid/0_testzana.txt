 Where before, the advancing Pakistani army lost in the war of the real north, the balance of war was tilted in favor of India

 After this battle, Pakistan's first armored division was sent back to Sialkot where it did not participate further in the war

 Earlier, both of these air forces participated in the First Kashmir War in the 1940s, in which their contribution was much less and limited to transportation as compared to 1965 war

 However, the two air forces were similar in the war, as most of the Indian Air Force was stationed east to avoid the possibility of China entering the war

 It was widely circulated that Pakistan's American aircraft are better than Indian aircraft, but according to some experts this was not correct as the Indian Air Force's mig-21, Hawker Hunter and Folland Nate fighter's performance from their rival Pakistan's F-86 Saber Was better

 According to Indians, the F-86 was weak in front of the small Folland Nate, causing these aircraft to be called "saber destroyers"

 But according to Sajjad Haider, those aircraft did not deserve this honor because they were made with the "purpose of stopping and combating Soviet bombers flying at an altitude of more than 40,000 feet", not with low-speed fighter aircraft
 To fight

 Both countries have made contrary claims to each other about the losses incurred in the fighting and few neutral sources have verified them

 According to a neutral source, the Pakistani Air Force flew 86 F-86 Sabers, 10 F-104 Starfighters, and 20 B-57 Canberra aircraft in a parade held shortly after the end of the war, claiming that the Indian Air Force had dropped 73 Pakistani aircraft
 It seems to be wrong, which was almost the entire first line of fighter jets of Pakistan at that time

 According to independent sources, the PAF had lost some 20 aircraft while the Indians had lost 60–75 aircraft

 In addition, it is estimated that if the conflict had continued for three weeks, the Pakistani losses would have increased by 33 percent and India's losses would have been 15 percent

 At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall
 Pakistani armor was largely American-made; It consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns
 The bulk of India's tank fleet were older M4 Sherman tanks; Some were up-gunned with the French high velocity CN 75 50 guns and could hold their own, whilst some older models were still equipped with the inferior 75 mm M3 l / 40 gun
 Besides the M4 tanks, India fielded the British-made Centurion Tank Mk 7, with the 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, and the AMX-13, PT-76, and M3 Stuart light tanks
 Pakistan fielded a greater number and more modern artillery; At the outbreak of war in 1965, Pakistan had about 15 armoured cavalry regiments, each with about 45 tanks in three squadrons
 Besides the Pattons, there were about 200 M4 Shermans re-armed with 76 mm guns, 150 M24 Chaffee light tank and a few independent squadrons of M36B1 tank destroyers
 Most of these regiments served in Pakistan's two armoured divisions, the 1st and 6th Armoured divisions – the latter being in the process of formation
 The Indian Army of the time possessed 17 cavalry regiments, and in the 1950s had begun modernizing them by the acquisition of 164 AMX-13 light tanks and 188 Centurions
 The remainder of the cavalry units were equipped with M4 Shermans and a small number of M3A3 Stuart light tanks
 India had only a single armored division, the 1st 'black Elephant' Armored Division, also called 'fakhr-i-hind', which resulted of the 17th Cavalry, the 4th Hodson's Horse, the 16th 'black Elephant' Cavalry, the 7th Light Cavalry, the 2nd Lancers, the 18th Cavalry and the 62nd Cavalry, the two first named being equipped with Centurions
 There was also the 2nd Independent Armored Brigade, one of whose three regiments, the 3rd Cavalry, was also equipped with Centurions
 Despite the qualitative and numerical superiority of Pakistani armour, Pakistan was outfought on the battlefield by India, which made progress into the lahore-sialkot sector, whilst halting Pakistan's counteroffensive on Amritsar
; they were sometimes employed in a faulty manner, such as charging prepared defenses during the defeat of Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division at Assal Uttar
 Although India's tank formations experienced the same results, India's attack at the Battle of Chawinda, led by its 1st Armored Division and supporting units, was brought to a grinding halt by the newly raised 6th Armored Division in the Chawinda sector
 The Indians lost 120 tanks at Chawinda
 One true winner to emerge was India's Centurion battle tank, with its 105 mm gun and heavy armor, which proved superior to the overly complex Pattons and their exaggerated reputations
 However, in the Sialkot sector outnumbered Pattons performed exceedingly well in the hands of the 25th Cavalry and other regiments of the 6th Armored Division, which exacted a disproportionately heavy toll of Centurions from the Poona Horse and Hodson's Horse
 The Indian Army has made much of the fact that some of its Centurions survived repeated hits; yet have failed to point out that the majority of tanks in the Sialkot sector were Shermans whose guns were inadequate even in 1944
 Neither the Indian nor Pakistani Army showed any great facility in the use of armored formations in offensive operations, whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes whether the Pakistani 1st Armored Division at Asal Uttar or the Indian 1st Armored Division at Chawinda
 In contrast, both proved adept with smaller forces in a defensive role such a the 2nd Armored Brigade at Asal Uttar and the 25th Cavalry at Chawinda, where they defeated their better equipped but clumsier foes The navies of India and Pakistan did not play a prominent role in the war of 1965, although Pakistani accounts dispute this
 On September 7, a flotilla of the Pakistani Navy carried out a small scale bombardment of the Indian coastal town and radar station of Dwarka, which was 200 miles south of the Pakistani port of Karachi
 Codenamed Operation Dwarka, it did not fulfill its primary objective of disabling the radar station and there was no immediate retaliatory response from India
 Later, some of the Indian fleet sailed from Bombay to Dwarka to patrol the area and deter further bombardment
 Foreign authors have noted that the "insignificant bombardment" of the town was a "limited engagement, with no strategic value
" According to some Pakistani sources, one submarine, PNS Ghazi, kept the Indian Navy's aircraft carrier INS Vikrant besieged in Bombay throughout the war
 Indian sources claim that it was not their intention to get into a naval conflict with Pakistan, and wished to restrict the war to a land-based conflict
 Moreover, they note that the Vikrant was in dry dock in the process of refitting
 Some Pakistani defense writers have also discounted claims that the Indian Navy was bottled up in Bombay by a single submarine, instead stating that 75% of the Indian Navy was under maintenance in harbor
 The Pakistan Army launched a number of covert operations to infiltrate and sabotage Indian airbases
 On September 7, 1965, the Special Services Group commandos were parachuted into enemy territory
 According to Chief of Army Staff General Musa Khan, about 135 commandos were airdropped at three Indian airfields
 The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster"
 Only 22 commandos returned to Pakistan as planned, 93 were taken prisoner, and 20 were killed in encounters with the army, police or civilians The reason for the failure of the commando mission is attributed to the failure to provide maps, proper briefings and adequate planning or preparation Despite failing to sabotage the airfields, Pakistan sources claim that the commando mission affected some planned Indian operations
 As the Indian 14th Infantry Division was diverted to hunt for paratroopers, the Pakistan Air Force found the road filled with transport, and destroyed many vehicles
 India responded to the covert activity by announcing rewards for captured Pakistani spies or paratroopers
 Meanwhile, in Pakistan, rumors spread that India had retaliated with its own covert operations, sending commandos deep into Pakistan territory, but these rumors were later determined to be unfounded
 Both India and Pakistan made absolutely mismatched claims about the loss of themselves and others
 donon deshon ke daavon kii sankshipt sarini is prakaar he There have been several neutral assessments of the losses incurred by both India and Pakistan during the war
 Most of these assessments agreed that India had an upper hand over Pakistan when ceasefire was declared
 Some of the neutral assessments are mentioned below - The war was militarily inconclusive; each side held prisoners and some territory belonging to the other
 Losses were relatively heavy—on the Pakistani side, twenty aircraft, 200 tanks, and 3,800 troops
 Pakistan's army had been able to withstand Indian pressure, but a continuation of the fighting would only have led to further losses and ultimate defeat for Pakistan
 Most Pakistanis, schooled in the belief of their own martial prowess, refused to accept the possibility of their country's military defeat by "hindu India" and were, instead, quick to blame their failure to attain their military aims on what they considered to be the ineptitude of Ayub Khan and his government
 Severely mauled by the larger Indian armed forces, Pakistan could continue the fight only by teaming up with Red China and turning its back on the UN The invading Indian forces outfought their Pakistani counterparts and halted their attack on the outskirts of Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city
 By the time sanyukt raashtra intervened on September 22, Pakistan had suffered a clear defeat
 The superior Indian forces, however, won a decisive victory and the army could have even marched on into Pakistani territory had external pressure not forced both combatants to cease their war efforts
 In three weeks the second indo-pak War ended in what appeared to be a draw when the embargo placed by Washington on U
S
 ammunition and replacements for both armies forced cessation of conflict before either side won a clear victory
 India, however, was in a position to inflict grave damage to, if not capture, Pakistan's capital of the Punjab when the cease-fire was called, and controlled Kashmir's strategic uri-poonch bulge, much to Ayub's chagrin
 India won the war
 It gained 1,840 square kilometers of Pakistani territory: 640 square kilometers in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan's portion of the state; 460 square kilometers of the Sailkot sector; 380 square kilometers far to the south of Sindh; and most critical, 360 square kilometers on the Lahore front
 Pakistan took 540 square kilometers of Indian territory: 490 square kilometers in the Chhamb sector and 50 square kilometers around Khem Karan
these are not correct pls review Although both sides lost heavily in men and material, and neither gained a decisive military advantage, bharat had the better of the war
 nai dilli achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force
 Pakistan gained nothing from a conflict which it had instigated
 India's strategic aims were modest - it aimed to deny Pakistani Army victory, although it ended up in possession of 720 square miles of Pakistani territory for the loss of just 220 square miles of its own
 a brief but furious 1965 war with India began with a covert Pakistani thrust across the Kashmiri cease-fire line and ended up with the city of Lahore threatened with encirclement by Indian Army
 Another un-sponsored cease-fire left borders unchanged, but Pakistan's vulnerability had again been exposed
 The 1965 indo-pak war lasted barely a month
 Pakistan made gains in the Rajasthan desert but its main push against India's jammu-srinagar road link was repulsed and Indian tanks advanced to within a sight of Lahore
 Both sides claimed victory but India had most to celebrate
 Again India appeared, logistically at least, to be in a superior position but neither side was able to mobilize enough strength to gain a decisive victory
 By just the end of the week, in fact, it was clear that the Pakistanis were more than holding their own
 sanyukt rajya america or soviet sangh ne donon dakshin asian deshon ke bich sangharsh main or vruddhi ko rokane ke liye mahatvapurn rajanyik upkaran kaa upyog kiya
 The Soviet Union, led by Premier Alexi Kossian, hosted a ceasefire talks in Tashkent, where Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan signed the Tashkent Agreement, withdrawing forces from 25 February 1966 onwards in pre-august Agreed to
 With declining stockpiles of ammunition, Pakistani leaders feared the war tilting in India's favor
 Therefore, they quickly accepted the ceasefire in Tashkent
 Despite strong opposition from Indian military leaders, bharat budged to growing international diplomatic pressure and accepted the ceasefire
 On September 22, the sanyukt raashtra Security Council unanimously passed a resolution that called for an unconditional ceasefire from both nations
 The war ended the following day
 India's Prime Minister, Shastri, suffered a fatal heart attack soon after the declaration of the ceasefire
 As a consequence, the public outcry in India against the ceasefire declaration transformed into a wave of sympathy for the ruling Indian National Congress
 The ceasefire was criticized by many Pakistanis who, relying on fabricated official reports and the controlled Pakistani press, believed that the leadership had surrendered military gains
 The protests led to student riots
 Pakistan State's reports had suggested that their military was performing admirably in the war - which they incorrectly blamed as being initiated by India - and thus the Tashkent Declaration was seen as having forfeited the gains
 Some recent books written by Pakistani authors, including one by ex-isi chief titled "the Myth of 1965 Victory", India and Pakistan accused each other of ceasefire violations; India charged Pakistan with 585 violations in 34 days, while Pakistan countered with accusations of 450 incidents by India
 In addition to the expected exchange of small arms and artillery fire, bharat reported that Pakistan utilized the ceasefire to capture the Indian village of Chananwalla in the Fazilka sector
 This village was recaptured by Indian troops on 25 December
 On October 10, a B-57 Canberra on loan to the PAF was damaged by 3 SA-2 missiles fired from the IAF base at Ambala
 a Pakistani Army Auster was shot down on 16 disambar killing one Pakistani army captain and on 2 farvari 1967, an AOP was shot down by IAF Hunters
 The ceasefire remained in effect until the start of the indo-pakistani War of 1971
 bharat or pakistan donon kii taraf se hui kai ranneetik galatiyon ke kaaran yah yuddh benatija si sthiti main aa pahunchaa
 Indian military intelligence gave no warning of the impending Pakistan invasion
 The Indian Army failed to recognize the presence of heavy Pakistani artillery and armaments in Chumb and suffered significant losses as a result
 The "official History of the 1965 War", drafted by the Ministry of Defence of India in 1992, was a long suppressed document that revealed other miscalculations
 According to the document, on September 22 when the Security Council was pressing for a ceasefire, the Indian Prime Minister asked commanding Gen
 Chaudhuri if India could possibly win the war, were he to delay accepting the ceasefire
 The general replied that most of India's frontline ammunition had been used up and the Indian Army had suffered considerable tank losses
 It was determined later that only 14% of India's frontline ammunition had been fired and India held twice the number of tanks as Pakistan
 By this time, the Pakistani Army had used close to 80% of its ammunition
 Air Chief Marshal PC Lal, who was the Vice Chief of Air Staff during the conflict, points to the lack of coordination between the IAF and the Indian Army
 Neither side revealed its battle plans to the other
 The battle plans drafted by the Ministry of Defense and General Chaudhari, did not specify a role for the Indian Air Force in the order of battle
 This attitude of Gen
 Chaudhari was referred to by ACM Lal as the "supremo Syndrome", a patronizing attitude sometimes held by the Indian Army towards the other branches of the Indian Military
 The Pakistani Army's failures started with the supposition that a generally discontented Kashmiri people, given the opportunity provided by the Pakistani advance, would revolt against their Indian rulers, bringing about a swift and decisive surrender of Kashmir
 The Kashmiri people, however, did not revolt
 Instead, the Indian Army was provided with enough information to learn of Operation Gibraltar and the fact that the Army was battling not insurgents, as they had initially supposed, but Pakistani Army regulars
 The Pakistani Army also failed to recognize that the Indian policy makers would order an attack on the southern sector in order to open a second theater of conflict
 Pakistan was forced to dedicate troops to the southern sector to protect Sialkot and Lahore instead using them to support penetrating into Kashmir
 "operation Grand Slam", which was launched by Pakistan to capture Akhnoor, a town north-east of Jammu and a key region for communications between Kashmir and the rest of India, was also a failure
 Many Pakistani commentators criticized the Ayub Khan administration for being indecisive during Operation Grand Slam
 These critics claim that the operation failed because Ayub Khan knew the importance of Akhnur to India and did not want to capture it and drive the two nations into an all-out war
 Despite progress being made in Akhnur, General Ayub Khan relieved the commanding Major General Akhtar Hussain Malik and replaced him with Gen
 Yahya Khan
 a 24-hour lull ensued the replacement, which allowed the Indian army to regroup in Akhnur and successfully oppose a lackluster attack headed by General Yahya Khan
 "the enemy came to our rescue", asserted the Indian Chief of Staff of the Western Command
 Later, Akhtar Hussain Malik criticized Ayub Khan for planning Operation Gibraltar, which was doomed to fail, and for relieving him of his command at a crucial moment in the war
 Malik threatened to expose the truth about the war and the army's failure, but later dropped the idea for fear of being banned
 Some authors have noted that Pakistan might have been emboldened by a war game - conducted in March 1965, at the Institute of Defense Analysis, USA
 The exercise awaited that, in the event of a war with India, Pakistan would win
 Other authors like Stephen Philip Cohen, have consistently commented that the Pakistan Army had "acquired an exaggerated view of the weakness of both India and the Indian military 


 the 1965 war was a shock"
 Pakistani air marshall va commander in chif of PAF during the war, nur khan, later said thgnf fhfhfffhn Army, and not India, should be blamed for starting the war
 However propaganda in Pakistan about the war continued; the war was not rationally analyzed in Pakistan, with most of the blame being heaped on the leadership and little importance given to intelligence failures that persisted until the debacle of the 1971 war, when then East Pakistan was invaded by India and seceded from West Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh
 hghginj u xxrep 4 j fhffuhhh Pakistan and the United States had signed an Agreement of Cooperation in 1959 under which the United States agreed to take "appropriate action, including the use of armed forces" in order to assist the Government of Pakistan at its request
 However, following the start of the 1965 war, the United States was of the view that the conflict was largely Pakistan's fault and therefore, it cut all military supplies to the country
 However, Pakistan did receive significant support from Iran, Indonesia and People's Republic of China
 Both before and during the war, the People's Republic of China had been a major military associate of Pakistan and had invariably admonished India, with whom it had fought a war in 1962
 There were also reports of Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to support Pakistan
 As such, bharat agreed to the UN mandate in order to avoid a war on both borders
 India's participation in the non-aligned Movement yielded little support from its members
 Despite close relations between with India, the Soviet Union was more neutral than most other nations during the war and even invited both nations to talks that it would host in Tashkent
 Despite the declaration of a ceasefire, bharat was perceived as the victor due to its success in halting the Pakistan-backed insurgency in Kashmir
 In its October 1965 issue, the TIME magazine quoted a Western official assessing the consequences of the war — Now it's obvious to everybody that India is going to emerge as an Asian power in its own right
 In light of the failures of the sino-indian War, the outcome of the 1965 war was viewed as a "politico-strategic" victory in India
 The Indian premier, Lal Bahadur Shastri, was hailed as a national hero in India
 While the overall performance of the Indian military was praised, military leaders were criticized for their failure to effectively deploy India's superior armed forces so as to achieve a decisive victory over Pakistan
 In his book "war in the modern world since 1815", noted war historian Jeremy Black said that though Pakistan "lost heavily" during the 1965 war, India's hasty decision to call for negotiations prevented further substantial damage to the Pakistan Armed Forces
 He elaborates - India's chief of army staff urged negotiations on the ground that they were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted
 In fact, the army had used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had double the number of serviceable tanks
 As a consequence, India focussed on enhancing communication and coordination within and among the triservices of the Indian Armed Forces
 Partly as a result of the inefficient information gathering preceding the war, India established the Research and Analysis Wing for external espionage and intelligence
 Major improvements were also made in command and control to address various shortcomings and the positive impact of these changes was clearly visible during the indo-pakistani War of 1971 when India achieved a decisive victory over Pakistan within two weeks
 China's repeated threats to intervene in the conflict in support of Pakistan increased pressure on the government to take an immediate decision to develop nuclear weapons
 Despite repeated assurances, the United States did little to prevent extensive use of American arms by Pakistani forces during the conflict which irked India
 At the same time, the United States and United Kingdom refused to supply India with sophisticated weaponry which further strained the relations between the West and India
 These developments led to a significant change in India's foreign policy — India, which had previously championed the cause of non-alignment, distanced itself further from Western powers and developed close relations with the Soviet Union
 By the end of 1960s, the Soviet Union emerged as the biggest supplier of military hardware to India
 From 1967 to 1977, 81% of India's arms imports were from the Soviet Union
 After the 1965 war, the arms race between India and Pakistan became even more asymmetric and India was outdistancing Pakistan by far
 At the conclusion of the war, many Pakistanis considered the performance of their military to be positive
 September 6 is celebrated as 'defense Day' in Pakistan, in commemoration of the successful defense of Lahore against the Indian Army
 The performance of the Pakistani Air Force, in particular, was praised
 However, the Pakistani government was accused by foreign analysts of spreading disinformation among its citizens regarding the actual consequences of the war
 In his book "mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani foreign policies", S
M
 Burke writes — After the indo-pakistani war of 1965 the balance of military power had decisively shifted in favor of India
 Pakistan had found it difficult to replace the heavy equipment lost during that conflict while her adversary, despite her economic and political problems, had been determinedly building up her strength
 Most observers agree that the myth of a mobile, hard hitting Pakistan Army was badly dented in the war, as critical breakthroughs were not made
 Several Pakistani writers criticized the military's ill-founded belief that their "martial race" of soldiers could defeat "hindu India" in the war
 Rasul Bux Rais, a Pakistani political analyst wrote – The 1965 war with India proved that Pakistan could neither break the formidable Indian defenses in a blitzkrieg fashion nor could she sustain an all-out conflict for long
 Moreover, Pakistan had lost more ground than it had gained during the war and, more importantly, failed to achieve its goal of occupying Kashmir; this result has been viewed by many impartial observers as a defeat for Pakistan
 Many high ranking Pakistani officials and military experts later criticized the faulty planning of Operation Gibraltar that ultimately led to the war
 The Tashkent declaration was also criticized in Pakistan, though few citizens realized the gravity of the situation that existed at the end of the war
 Political leaders were also criticized
 Following the advice of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's foreign minister, Ayub Khan had raised very high expectations among the people of Pakistan about the superiority - if not invincibility - of its armed forces, but Pakistan's inability to attain its military aims during the war, created a political liability for Ayub
 The defeat of its Kashmiri ambitions in the war led to the army's invincibility being challenged by an increasingly vocal opposition
 One of the most far reaching consequences of the war was the wide-scale economic slowdown in Pakistan
 The cost of the 1965 war put an end to the impressive period economic growth Pakistan had experienced during early 1960s
 Between 1964 and 1966, Pakistan's defence spending rose from 4
82% to 9
86% of GDP, putting tremendous strain on Pakistan's economy
 By 1970–71, defence spending comprised a whopping 55
66% of government expenditure
 Pakistan was surprised by the lack of support by the United States, an ally with whom the country had signed an Agreement of Cooperation
 USA declared its neutrality in the war by cutting off military supplies to both sides, leading Islamabad to believe that they were "betrayed" by the United States
 After the war, Pakistan would increasingly look towards China as a major source of military hardware and political support
 Another negative consequence of the war was the growing resentment against the Pakistani government in East Pakistan, particularly for West Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir
 Bengali leaders accused the central government of not providing adequate security for East Pakistan during the conflict, even though large sums of money were taken from the east to finance the war for Kashmir
 In fact, despite some Pakistan Air Force attacks being launched from bases in East Pakistan during the war, bharat did not retaliate in that sector, although East Pakistan was defended only by an understrenghted infantry division, sixteen planes and no tanks
 Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was critical of the disparity in military resources deployed in East and West Pakistan, calling for greater autonomy for East Pakistan, which ultimately led to the Bangladesh Liberation war and another war between India and Pakistan in 1971

 The decline in this surgery did not come on a gradual basis
 For example, there were 153 lobotomies in 1953 in psychiatric hospitals in Ottawa, which were reduced to 58 in 1961 after the arrival of the anti-psychotropic drug Chlorpromazine in Canada in 1954

 In December 1888, Gottlieb Burkhart, a psychiatrist with little experience of surgery, made his first foray into the field of psychiatry when he underwent surgery in a private psychiatric clinic in Switzerland, between two women and four men, six patients

 Only two patients with no complications were recorded
 burkhart kii karrwai kaa saidhantik aadhaar teen prastaav the
 The first was that mental illness had a physical basis and that distorted minds were merely reflections of distorted brains
 aglaa, tantrika prakaarya kaa sanghavaadi drushtikon he jisane nimnlikhit titarafa shram vibhaajan ke anusaar tantrika tantra ke kaary karne kii kalpana kii thiah ek nivesh pranali, ek sangyojan pranali jo soochna kaa sansaadhan karti thi) or ek nirgam pranali
 burkhart kii antim dharna thi ki mastishk pramapiya tha jiskaa matlab tha ki prayek maansik pramaap yaa maansik sankaay mastishk main ek vishisht sthaan se jude ho sakate the
 According to such an approach, Burkhart believed that lesions in specific areas of the brain could affect behavior in a specific way
 duusare shabdon main, unhone sochaa ki sangyojan pranali yaa mastishk kii sanchaar pranali kii duusari sahyogi avasthaa ko kaat dene se, tantrika tantra ke nivesh yaa nirgam tantron ke saath samjhauti kiye bina pareshaan karne vaale lakshanon ko kam kiya ja saktaa tha
 The purpose of this surgery was to relieve symptoms, not to treat mental illness
 Therefore, he wrote in 1891: yadi uttejnaa or aavegi vyavhaar is tathy kii vajah se hai ki gunvattta, maatra or tivrata main asaamaanya uttejnaayen samvedi sataha uthati hai or prerak satahon par kaary karti hai, to donon satahon ke bich ek baadha paidaa karke sudhaar praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Elimination of the inspiratory or sensory area will expose us to the danger of serious functional disturbances and technical difficulties
 It will be more beneficial to cut a strip of cortex behind and on both sides of the motor area and make a drain in the lobe of the temple

 While his findings were later widely published in the psychiatric literature, the reviews were consistently negative, and the surgery performed by him was heavily criticized
 1983 main likhte hue creplin ne burkhart ke prayaason kii tikhi aalochana kii or kaha ki "us ne suzav diya ki baichaiyn rogiyon ke mastishk kii praantastha ko khurch kar unhen shant kiya ja saktaa tha
 "while Italian neuropsychiatry professor Giuseppe Sepilli commented in 1891 that Burkhart's view of the brain being theatrical is" more often than not, psychosis is a widespread diagnosis of the cerebral cortex, and does not correspond and consider the mind as a unitary unit
 Is against the concept of "
 burkhart ne 1891 main likhaa tha ki "doctor swabhaav se alag hote hai
 Stick to the old principles of one type: first, do no harm; Others say: it is better to do something than do nothing
 i definitely belong to the second category ”
 The statement was responded to by French psychiatrist Armand Semlen when he wrote that "it is better not to have a cure rather than a bad treatment"
 After the publication of his 81-page influential treatise on the subject in 1891, Burckhardt ended his career of exploration and psychology, undoubtedly partly because he had to face ridicule from his peers for the methods he had adopted
 1891 main unke monograph par tippanee karte hue british manochikitsak wiliam ireland ne apni sthiti kaa sankshipt sankalan prastut kiyah Dr
 Burkhardt strongly believes in the view that the mind is made up of many faculties, which have their definite places in the brain
 jahaan kisi kaary kii adhikta yaa gadabadi hoti he ve ugr kendron ke us bhaag ke uchhedan dwaara rokane kii koshish karte hai
 He defends the criticisms that were certainly leveled at his enthusiastic treatment by showing the depressing aspect of the disease of the patients who underwent surgery
 lekin ireland ko is baat main shaq tha ki koi angrej manochikitsak burkhart dwaara apanaae gaye “dussahsee” maarg kaa anusaran karegaa
 The next stage in the development of this operation was provided by Portuguese physician and neurologist Antonio Igas Moniz, who was highly praised in 1927 for his work on cerebral angiography
 Despite having no clinical experience and actually having little interest in psychiatry, he invented a surgery called the cerebrovascular lobotomy at the Sata Marta Hospital in Lisbon in 1935, and under his direction by neurologist Pedro Alameda Lima
 ve shabd manoshalcchikitsa ke prarambh ke liye bhi jimmedaar the
 This operation involved perforating the patient's head with a drill and destroying the tissues with alcohol by injection into the frontal section

 According to the diagnosis, nine patients were suffering from depression, six with schizophrenia, two with panic disorder and one each suffering from mania, catarrhal and manic depression, the major symptoms being nervousness and excitement

 Post-operative follow-up assessments were performed somewhere between one and ten weeks after surgery
 The complications observed were less severe than in Burkhardt's cases, as neither resulted in any deaths, nor did anyone have epileptic seizures and the most commonly found complication was fever
 monij kii agrani manoshalcchikitsa kaa saidhantik aadhaar mukhyatah unnisvin shatabdi ke anuroop tha jo ki unase pehle burkhart ke siddhanton kaa aadhaar bana tha
 Although in his later writings he also referred to Ramon y Cayal's neural cell theory and Ivan Pavlov's adapted reflex, in essence he interpreted this new neuroscientific research in the context of the old associative theory
 They were quite different from Burkhardt because they did not think that mentally ill people had any physical physiological diagnosis in their brains, but rather their neural pathways were found in stable and destructive circuits
 jaisaa ki unhone 1936 main likhaa thah Mental disturbances should be related to the formation of cell – connective-grouping that has become more or less stable

 Traditionally, the question of why Moniz targeted the frontal section was referenced by John Fulton and Carlile Jacobson during a presentation at the Second International Congress of Neurology held in London in 1935
 Fulton and Carlile presented two chimpanzees whose frontal sections were lobed
 pehle se vyavhaar vikaron se peedit in chimpangiyon par is shalyakriya kaa shantidaayak prabhaav hua
 It has been alleged that this encouraged Moniz to encourage and inspire the use of such techniques on psychiatric patients as well
 However, as Berrios points out, this is contrary to the fact that Moniz had long ago given his idea of psychiatry in confidence to his colleague Lima in 1933
 or na hi 1936 main shalyakriya ke bare main likhte samay unhone phulton or karlile ke prastutikaran ke kisi prabhaav kaa koi ullekh kiya
 Indeed, as Kotovich writes, he was attracted by a case presented by Richard Brickner at the same conference in which a patient's frontal segment was cut and his intelligence was not deteriorated during the experience of diminishing effects

 1946 main friman ne ek jivit rogi par pehali baar paranetragolkeey mastishkakhandaedan kiya tha
 Its simplicity suggested possibilities of doing it in psychiatric hospitals without the necessary surgical facilities for faster and more complex operations
 In 1947, Freeman and Watts' partnership ended as Watts was frustrated with Freeman's lobotomy being transformed from a surgery to an "office" procedure
 1940 or 1944 ke bich, sanyukt rajya america main 684 mastishkakhandaedan kiye gaye
 However, these numbers increased rapidly towards the end of the decade due to the intense encouragement of technology by Freeman and Watts

 Concerns about lobotomy continued to increase
 The Soviet Union officially banned this surgery in 1950
 Physicians in the Soviet Union concluded that the operation was "contrary to the principles of humanity" It was "to turn a mad man into a fool
" " 1970 ke dashak tak, kai deshon ne shalyakriya par pratibandh laga diya tha, aisa hi kai america rajyon ne bhi kiya
 Other forms of psychiatric therapy continued to be practiced in legally controlled and regulated US centers and in Finland, Sweden, Britain, Spain, India, Belgium and the Netherlands

 By the early 1970s the use of lobotomy was generally stopped, but some countries continued to use other forms of psychiatric therapy
 For example, in 2001, there were about 70 surgeries in Belgium, 15 in the UK, and about 15 per year at Massachusetts General Hospital Boston, while in France in the 1980s, five patients were operated on per year
 yah aksar kaha jaataa he ki jab 1848 main ek lohe kii chad durghatanavash finees geg ke sir main se nikal gai thi, to yah ek aakasmik mastishkakhandaedan ban gaya, yaa yah ki is ghatana ne kisi prakaar se ek shatabdi baad mastishkakhandaedan shalya chikitsa ko prerit kiya

 In 1946, Robert Penn Warren described the lobotomy in his novel All the King's Men, saying, "a brave brave looks like a novice has been stabbed"
 The surgeon is depicted as a repressed man who, through love, cannot change others, hence resorting to "high-grade carpentry work"

 29 oktober san 1923 ko somvaar ke din chandramaa zamin par utar aayaa tha
 There is a village in Morena District of Madhya Pradesh - Kasamda village falls under Kasmadah Ambah Tehsil
 is gaanv main ek brahaman parivaar rahaa karata tha jiske mukhiya the shri mata prasad mishra
 29 oktober ko mata prasad ji kii patni ne ek putr ratna ko janm diya
 At birth there was a supernatural shining on the child's face
 bachche kaa naam bhagwan shri krishna ke naam par krishna govind rakhaa gaya
 Krishna Govind was a promising stunning boy since childhood
 ek baar mata prasad ji ke ghar kuch sanyasi aae
 When he saw this stunning child, he was stunned
 unhone bhavishyavaanee kii ki ye baccha bada hokar ek mahaan sanyasi banegaa
 iske baad unhone bachche kii maan se prarthana kii ki ye baccha hame de do
 Hearing this, Krishna's mother was so scared that she took the child inside the house and went away
 unhone bachche ko dene se spasht inkaar kar diya
 When Krishna grew up, amazing things happened to him
 jab krishna bi
 e
 main padhta tha tab bhi ek baar aise hi ghatana ghati
 raat kaa samay tha
 Krishna was bedded on the ground
 sardi ke din chal rahe the or mausam bahut hi thanda tha
 Krishna was sleeping in the quilt, there was no electricity in those days
 so kamare main puri tarah se andheraa tha
 Then a snake entered her quilt
 saanp uske pair se chadh kar pet se hote hue uski gardan par ja chadhaa
 parantu uske mukh kaa tej vah sahan nahin kar sakaa
 He started going from his neck to the other side of his leg
 isi dauraan balak krishna kii neend tut gai
 He felt what is going on on his body
 usne usko uthaakar haath main le liya
 When he saw that it was a snake, he picked up the snake and threw it out the window
 balak krishna ek meghavi chaatr tha, usne apni praarambhik shiksha ambah se hi praapt kii
 But in those days there was no high school in Ambah
 so hai skool kii padhai karne ke liye unhen gwalior aana padaa
 gwalior se san 1944 main unhone hai skool kii pariksha uteern kii
 After high school, after that, his parents wanted him to get a job
 His cousin was a Sanskrit professor, once he came to Ambah, he also took Krishna with him to Ahmedabad
 krishna govind anichhaa se vahaan naukari karne chale gaye
 But luck had something else approved
 ahmedabad main unhone sirf ek raat hi kaati thi
 That night became a memorable night in his life
 jo bistar unhen sone ke liye diya gaya tha usame khatmal bhare hue the
 Bedbugs kept cutting them all night
 ab ye bhagwan kii lila hi kahi ja sakati he ki saanp jaisaa vishaiylla praani bhi jab unke tej ko sahan nahin kar paaya to tuchh khatmal ne unhen kaise kaat liya? jaise-taise unhone wo raat guzari or subah hote hi waapas ghar ke liye chal die
 He gave up the idea of doing a job
 ahmedabad se train dwaara agra hote hue wo waapas ghar pahunch gaye
 After that he thought of getting higher education
 ghar aane ke baad krishna kii shaadi kar di gai
 His wife Smt Revathi Devi was the form of Sakshat Lakshmi and Saraswati
 unhone krishna ko ucch shiksha ke liye protsaahit kiya
 Krishna came to Gwalior to pursue further studies
 gwalior main rah kar unhone ne hindi main M
A
 kii padhai puri kii
 Thereafter b
ed
 did
 ucch shiksha ki padhai ke liye paison ki aavashyaktaa thi
 But they did not have so much money to meet the expenses of studies
 apni padhai puri karne ke baad san 1951 main ve waapas ghar aa gaye
 In those days the condition of education in Ambah was very bad
 vahaan koi skool nahin tha
 Krishna pledged to start a school there
 He established a high school there
 san 1952 main is skool ke pehle batch ne hai skool kii pariksha uteern kii
 Not only was Krishna brilliant in studies, he also had a good ability to manage
 unke skool ke pratham batch ke sabhi vidhyaarthee achche nambaron se uteern hue
 The manager of this school was Mr
 Ramnivas Sharma
 sharma ji se krishna ke sambandh bahut achche the
 But luckily, something else was written
 san 1957 main vidhaan sabha ke chunaav hone the
 Ramnivas Sharma also filled the election ticket
 par raajnneeti ko lekar krishna tathaa ramanivas ke vichaar bhinn the
 Therefore, Krishna supported another candidate Shukla instead of Ramnivas
 krishna shukla ke chunaav prachaar main bhi shaamil hue
 ramanivas ko yah baat pasand nahin ai
 unhone skool ke menager kii haisiyat se krishna ko 'kaaran bataao' notice de diya
 Krishna said that voting and supporting someone is a personal matter
 tathaa skool menager kii haisiyat se ramanivas ko yah poochne kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 Due to these differences, Krishna resigned from the school in 1958
 lekin yah acha hi hua
 This incident intensified his education campaign even more
 unhone or zyada skool khol kar zyada se zyada bacchon ko shikshit karne kaa kaam shuru kar diya, unhone jila muraina ke dharamgarh main do nae skool khole
 iske baad jila bhind main bhi do nae skool khole
 unke skulon ke sankhya babbti ja rahi the
 Krishna's schools, which specialize in management, were constantly being promoted
 unke skool ke meghavi bachche aage jaakar bade skool main daakhila le lete
 unhone pandari main bhi ek skool kholaa
 Ten years passed in this way
 krishna ke skool lagaataar tarakkee kiye ja rahe the
 The result of school was always good
 ramanivas unki tarakkee ko bahut dinon se dekh rahe the
 One day Ramnivas called him to meet him
 krishna jab unase milane gaye to ramanivas ne unase apane skool kaa pradhanadhyaapak banane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Krishna was meant only by the education of children
 us skool kaa prabandhan un dinon acha nahin tha
 Even children were not being given good education
 so unhone prastaav sweekaar kar liya
 But he placed a condition that he would not apply
 yadi unako sarvasammati se pradhanadhyaapak niyukt kiya jayega tabhi wo yah pad sweekaar karenge
 Ramnivas and other members of the school trust accepted this
 is tarah se krishna principal ban gaye
 One day Krishna was sitting at a clothes shop in the market
 tabhi vahaan se master madhav singh badi teji se saath jate hue dikhaai die
 He asked what is the matter? Where are you running so fast? Madhav Singh told that his Guru Swami Shri Shivom Tirtha Ji Maharaj has come
 ve unase milane hi ja rahe the
 Krishna said, introduce us to them too
 ram nivas ne unhen bhi aapane saath le liya
 Both reached Guruji
 krishna ko maaloom tha kii swamiji shaktipaat parampara ke bahut hi siddh guru hai
 Upon reaching Swamiji, Krishna sat in a corner
 swamiji ek palang par baithe hue kuch pard rahe the
 People used to come there, touch Swamiji's feet
 Talked a little to Swamiji and then left
 krishna kaaphi der tak vahaan baithe rahe
 When everyone left, Swamiji started studying again
 bahut samay vyateet ho jane ke baad swamiji ne krishna ko vahaan baithe hue dekha
 unhone poocha kii aap yahan kyon baithe hue hai
 Krishna said that i too "need your favor"
 Swamiji Swamiji kept watching Krishna carefully for a while
 phir kaha ki madhav singh se baat kar lo
 ye ghatana dekhne main to saamaanya lagati he kintu is ghatana ke garbh main kya chupa tha ye kisi ko bhi nahin maaloom tha
 This normal incident changed the lives of many people
 krishna ne madhav singh ke paas jaakar kaha kii swamiji ne aap se baat karne ke liye kaha he
 Madhav Singh understood that Swamiji had asked for initiation
 madhav singh ne saare prabandh kar die
 And thus in 1973 Krishna was initiated into the Shaktipat tradition
 iske baad 15 saal tak krishna apane skool chalaate rahe tathaa saath main swamiji dwaara bataai gai riti se saadhan bhi karte rahe
 Krishna retired at the age of 63 in 1986
 unke guru swami shivom tirth ji maharaj un dinon rishikesh kii paavan bhoomi main sthit yoga shri peeth ashram main nivas karte the
 Krishna came to Rishikesh to meet him
 swamiji ne unase kaha kii tum ek kushal prabandhak ho
 i am going to Dewas for some time, so take care of the work of the ashram
 Krishna followed the order of Swamiji and started looking into the arrangement of the ashram
 thode samay ke baad krishna ko ghar kii yaad aane lagi
 He started waiting for Swamiji's arrival so that he could go home after taking orders from him
 But Swamiji did not come for two years
 do varshon ke baad san 1988 main jab swamiji waapas aae to unhone krishna ko ajna di kii ghar ke ichha tyaag kar sanyas le lo
 krishna ke liye guru kii ajna sarvopari thi
 He immediately abandoned his desire to go home and took retirement
 13 june san 1988 ko ganga dashahra ke pawan avasar par krishna ke sanyas kii prakriya puri hui
 This day was a day of great change
 hindu parampara ke anusaar sanyas ke baad naam badal jaataa he
 So, Krishna's name was changed to Swami Govindanand Tirtha Maharaj
 swami govindanand tirth maharaj ke liye ye sirf naam kaa badlaav hi nahin tha
 His thinking, activity changed everything
 ab unka adhikansh samay saadhan karne tathaa ashram sanbhaalane main vyateet hone laga
 At the time of renunciation, Swami Shivom Tirtha Ji Maharaj also gave him the power to grant mantra initiation
 san 1992 main unhen shaktipaat diksha dene kii anumati bhi maharaj ji se mil gai
 Since then, Swamiji is seated at the Yoga Sri Peeth Ashram in Rishikesh
 swamiji ne anek shishyon ko shaktipaat kii diksha dekar unke jivan ko badal diya he
 Virendra Upadhyaya has written a book - "sri Govindamratbhajan Bhagirathi"
 This book is dedicated to Swamiji
