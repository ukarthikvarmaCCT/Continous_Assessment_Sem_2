 kabhi shikari rah chuke billy jab ek din apni hathini par savaar ho jangal main daakhil hue to suheli or nevara nadiyon ke madhya bhaag ko dekhakar stabdh rah gayi, athulaneey prakritik soundarya se aachhadit thi ye dharti jiske chaaro taraf shakhu ke vistaarit van
 It was this watch that determined the presence of Tiger Haven
 san 1969 i0 main yah jangal billy ne kharid liya, jiske dakshin-uttar main saritaayen or pashchim-purv main ghaney van
 And here established tiger haven for tigers and tendu
 arjan singh ke nirantar prayaason se san 1977 main dudhwa neshnal park bana or fir tiger project kii shuruwat hui or is project ke tahat san 1988 main dudhwa neshnal park or kishanpur vanya jeev vihaar milakar dudhwa taigar rigerv kii sthapana kar di gayi
 Billy's contribution to preserving the reindeer in the Sathiana Range forests adjacent to Tiger Haven is memorable
 arjan singh hameshaa kehete rahe kii faresti department se wild-life ko alag kar alag vibhaag banaaya jaay, wild-life department! kyonki us jamaane main faresti department jangal bachaane ke bajaae kataane ke prayaas main adhik tha, sarkare jangalon kaa timber maffiaon ke dwaara inkaa vyavsaayee karan kar rahi thi
 If this separate department is made, then the people who join it will come after acquiring wildlife expertise
 jangalon kii tuutati shrankhlaayein billy ke liye chintaa kaa vishay rahi, kyonki baaghon kaa dayera bahut bada hota he or yadi jangal sikudte gayi to baagh bhi kam hote jaayenge! kabhi aadmi ke na rahane yogya is ilaake main "da colective farms and faresti limited ne 10,000 hectare junglee bhoomi kaa safaaya kar diya or log pakistan se aa aa kar basane lage, baad main bhudaan aandonlan main basaayen gayi logon ne ghaas ke maidaanon ko ganne ke kheton main tabdeel kar diya
 And the Dudhwa forest was transformed into a forest island
 jo billy ko sadaiv pareshaan karata rahaa
 After independence, the way people moved in this wild area and kept converting forest land into agricultural land, the reason is now erasing the existence of tigers and other creatures
 baaghon ke liye adhik sangrakshit kshetron kii unki khwis ke kaaran hi kishanpur vanya-jeev vihaar kaa vajood main aana hua jo ab dudhwa tiger rigerv kaa ek hissaa he
 Impressed by Jim Corbett and the FW Champion, Billy Arjan Singh wrote eight books which are the best accounts of this series of North India
 baagh va tenduon ke shavakon ko trend kar unhe unke prakritik awaas yani jangal main safalata purvak punervasit karne kaa jo kaary billy arjan singh ne kiya vah adwitiya he puure sansar main
 Prince, Harriet and Juliet were three of their tenders who were fully rehabilitated in the forest, later the tigress Tara, brought from the Zoo of England, also succeeded in making Dudhwa's forests their home
 iskaa natiza hai tara kii pidhia jo dudhwa ke wanon main fal-phul rahi hai
 Billy tried to discredit Tara as being a combination of Siberian or other breeds, and named it "genetic pollution", while genetic science suggests that geographic boundaries and interconnected species living in different environmental areas are not harmful
 Is rather better
 yadi aisa hota to koi angrej kisi asin desh main vaivaahik sambadh nahin sthapit karata or na hi asin kisi america yaa africa se
 In Indian tradition also, the matrimonial relationship is invalid and in science terms also, how the Siberian, Russian-born tigress has genetic pollution related to tigers of India
 in-bridigan ke khataron se bachane ke liye bhinn-bhinn samudaayon ke jeevon ke madhya sambadh sthapit karaate hai taaki unki jin-vividhita barkaar rahe or billy ne is prakaar dudhwa ke baaghon main yah vividhita kaayam kii
 In Dudhwa, Tara's hustle is growing steadily, the presence of an indo-siberian breed in the tigers of Dudhwa has also been considered as a scientific institution, but arrangements are being feared to be officially accepted
 yah sabit ho chukaa he, ki dudhwa ke jangal main baagh siberian-royal bengal tiger kii jin-vividhita ke saath is nasl ko or majboot bana rahe hai
 Due to this genetic diversity, the breed of Indian tigers will be better now
 nahin to sikud chuke jangalon main ye baagh aapas main hi sambadh kaayam karte

 Hence the animal is completely immune
 rogon ke akraman main bhi yahi hoti he

 is prakaar kii pratiraksha chirsthayee bhi hoti he

 pratirodh weldon main dhaatu ke do tukdon ko jodne ke liye vidyut dhara ke saath yantric daab kaa sahaara liya jaataa he
 Weldon electrodes have currents flowing when the two pieces being welded are joining
 weldon kii is kriya main pehle vidyut dhara dwaara dhaatuon ke ek chote se bhaag main kam se kam itani ooshmaa paidaa kii jaati he ki vahaan kaa bhaag dravit ho jaay
 After this, both the pieces are kept under pressure for some time so that the molten metal cools down and it has enough strength to stay connected with each other
 pratirodh weldon dwaara weldon main damak weldon, chitti, prakshepi, sivan or takkar kii vidhiyaan mukhya hai
 This method of Weldon is also similar to the Weldon method of collision, the only difference being that the current is fed into the device before the two bodies are in contact and the electric current in the gap between the bodies when approaching them
 The current of the arc leads to melting of the edges of the micelles
 jab dhaatu ke kuch chhite unamem se uchhalane lagate hai, tab dhara ko band kar yantra se hi unhen dabaakar jod dete hai
 This method of Weldon is adopted where the edges of the metal sheets are folded one by one
 iskaa siddhant bhi takkar ke weldon ke samaan hi he
 Its principle is also similar to that of percussion weldons
 is kaam ke yantra main, weldon karanevaale kinaaron ko ek duusare ke upar neeche rakhkar, yantra main lage do electrodon ke bich main rakh dete hai
 Then pressing a lever with the foot, the uppermost electrode descends down and suppresses those plates with the power of compressed air and as soon as it comes in contact with the electrodes and the plates, an electric current flows through it and enters the bottom electrode passing through the plates
 Is, at that time the portion of the plates that come in contact with those electrodes is heated and reaches the temperature of the weldon, those electrodes Issues of pressure and extended, so that they are aligned with each other on the place and there is likely a spot C
 weldon kii is vidhi ke siddhant bhi ve hi hai ja chitti weldon ke hai, keval bhed yahi he ki isamen electrode se praapt honevaali ooshmaa ek chote se bindu par hi kendrit kar di jaati he
 By the way, the area of electrodes is quite large
 ooshmaa ko kendrit karne ke liye ek athwa donon platon main ubhaar yaa gaddha bana diya jaataa he
 By this method, plates of different thicknesses can also be joined together
 yah vidhi bhi siddhant or kriya main chitti weldon ke samaan hi he, antar yahi he ki electrode sthir stambh ke aakaar ke hone ke badale belanaakaar ghoomte hue banaae jate hai or judanevaale platon ko unke bich yantra se chalaaya jaataa he tathaa un belanon kii vidyut dhara aantrayik rup se chatka lagaati hui chalati he
 The ratio of the flow of flow and stoppage time can be kept from 1: 1 to 1:10, so the joint looks as if it is given by a string
 is vidhi main mashin ke ek shikanje main ek tukade ko pehle sthirataa se baandhakar, duusare tukade ko sarkanevaale duusare shikanje main is prakaar band dete hai
 That when bringing the two closer, the joint fits right
 yah donon shikaje vidyutrodhi aavarnon dwaara i duusare se vidyutarodhi aavarnon dwaara ek-duusare se vidyutruddh rahete hai or inamen vidyut dhara dene ke ek kii dhara duusare main nahin jane paati
 When the sliding screws move along the cladding to the stationary shingle, the heat of the joining edges of these gases reaches the heat of the weldon when approaching the edges, being overheated by the effect of the high resistance of the current
 Then the edges are gradually pressed down and the current is stopped

 Gunadhya answered this challenge and rivalry by his furious pledge
 lekin sharvaverma ne usee avadhi main maharaj ko vyakaran kaa acha gyaan kara hi diya
 As a result, according to the promise, Gunadhya had to leave the city for exile and leave Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit and take shelter of the diabolical
 vidwaanon kaa ek varg gunanty ko kashmiri maanata he jisase pashachi se unka sambandh swaabhaavik ho jaataa he
 In the same language, he composed his 'badkakaha' of seven lakhs, which according to Kanbhuti is told the story of Vidyadhendra, written on leather

 Although the Baddakha of Gunadhya is unavailable, however, as the Adisrots of the tradition of the Saptashtis are described as 'gahasattasai', the past of Indian fictional literature is combined with Badkha
