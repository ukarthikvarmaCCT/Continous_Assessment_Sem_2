 Critic Alan Ribble has ridiculed the digital effects produced in the circus and its reliance on the effects of robots
 "vah kabhi bhi ek shashakt gayika nahin rahi he
 

 "writes Ribble," will she be able to handle these songs with unflattering arrangements and any vocal influence-inferiority? More importantly, would anyone want to listen to such a performance or song? Does it matter No
 The focus is still on the basic thing
 " Her image and personality are often contrasted with Christina Aguilera
 antertenment vikali ke david brown ne dekha he ki "christina aguilera twachaa or naabhi ko dikhaati to he lekin apane sangeet or vyavhaar main, vah kisi ko aprasann na karne ke prati adhik icchhuk rahati he -- vah ek acchhee ladki he jo buree hone kaa keval naatak karti he
 However, Spears appears to be a bad girl performing well
 

 spirs kii banaavati or madhur bana dene vaali awaz settings kii tulana main bahut kam rochak he lekin phir bhi aguilera ke stabdh mukhar jimnastics kii tulana main uske yah komalta vastav main ek raahat kaa kaam karti he
 In contrast, Allmusic comments: "like her friend Christina Aguilera, Britney equates maturity with transparent sexuality and the loud sounds of nightclubs
 

 jahaan christina ek aajanm scank kii tarah maaloom padati he, vahiin britaini ek aisi ladki he jo college main kating loose ke agle dwaar par he, vah itani laaparvaahee se drink leti he or dhumrapaan karti he or nrity karti he or thodaa-bahut sambhog bhi karti he, aisa lagata he ki vah sirf isi pehali baar main hi swayan ko trupt kar sakati he
 "sal Sinkmani of Slant Magazine notes that" the disparity between Aguilera and Spears cannot be measured simply by the rhythm and gamut range of their voices
 

 lokapriyata, britaini kii ativyakulata ke pich tak kabhi nahin pahunchi he
 It has been widely reported that Spears, like other dance-oriented pop stars, lip-syncs in concerts
 lekhak gairi gidins ne apane pustak natural sellection: gairi gidins on kamedi, film, music, and books main likhaa he ki "ek mashin kii tarah apane honton ko hilaane vaale kalakaaron main britaini spirs, luciano paavaroti, shania twain, bayons or madonna shaamil hai
 "the Baltimore Sun's Rashad D
 Allison observed:" Many pop stars 


 feel they have no other option but to improve the vocals
 MTV or anya video sangeet channelon ke aagaman ke baad se, pop darshakon ko jo-droping prabhaav, vismayaakul koreography, shandaar kapadon, adbhut kaaya vaale vistrut video dikhaae jate rahe hai
 And the same level of perfection is also expected from the concert stage, beyond the video set
 isliye yadi britaini spirs, jenet jackson yaa madonna bina kisi baking trek ke karnavedhi or sapaat swar nikaalte hai to sangeet-samaaroh ke ek tikat ke liye prashansak $300 tak kaa bhugtan nahin karenge
" gidins kehete hai, "aisi report mili thi ki britaini spirs ke prashansak -- aisa karne se uski asweekruti ke baavjood -- uske lip-sinc ko zyada pasand karte hai kyonki jab ve ek sangeet-samaaroh ke liye adhik paise kaa bhugtan karte hai tab ve dosharahit digitalykaran kii ummid karte hai
 "noting the hype of lip-syncing, the Los Angeles Daily News reports that" In the context of a concert by Britney Spears, does it really matter? " Like a Vegas Review show, you don't go to listen to music, you just go for its somewhat ridiculous spectacle
 "similarly, Alin Mendelsohn of the Orlando Sentinel comments:" Get one thing clear: Britney Spears' concert is not for music
 

 aapako yaad rakhana he ki yah drishy ke bare main he, swar ke bare main nahin
" samalochak glen gamboa ne tipanni qi he ki uske sangeet-samaaroh ke daure "uske jivan kii tarah hai -- jo ek bade paimaane par paise-kamaane kaa udhyam he jise uski pratibha ko abhinit karne ke liye or takneekee-rangath vaali sex apil or disco-flavor vaali chakachaundh ke mishran se uski khaamiyon par se dhyaan hataane ke liye dizine kiya gaya he
 And, like his life, it is also, overall, a success
 apane jivan-vritti ke dauraan, apane kaam ke prabhaav ke rup main jenet jackson or madonna kaa uddhran dete hue, kanthswar, koreography or rangamanch kii upasthiti ke kshetra main, spirs ne unke saath praayah raharah kar tulana qi he
 He has also named Michael Jackson as a source of inspiration
 spirs ke anusaar: "main jaanati hum ki jab main bahut choti thi, tab main logon kaa


 jaisaa ki aap jaanate hai, jenet jackson or madonna kaa aadar karti thi
 And those people were a big inspiration for me
 lekin meri bhi apni khud kii pahchaan thi or main jaanati thi ki main koun hum, aaplog to jaanate hi hai
 "she is quoted in Carol Clerk's 2002 book, Madonna, stating:" i have been a big fan of Madonna ever since i was a little girl
 i really, really wanted to be a legend like Madonna
 

 uske koreography ne nishchit rup se ladakiyon ke liye usamen pravesh karne or apana swayan kaa kuch karne kaa maarg prashast kar diya
" Many critics have argued that Spears should not be considered the same stage or group of talent as Jackson or Madonna
 Rocky Mountain Collegian journalists, Erica Montalvo and Jackie Sheppard, observed that "some can be argued that Spears is not only a good recording artist but also an important cultural icon
" " haalanki, ek kalakaar ke rup main uske dakshata ke str kii jaanch ke bare main, yah sawaal uthaaya gaya he ki "yadhyapi use jenet jackson or madonna jaisi utkrisht mahilaon main vargeekrut kiya gaya he par vastav main rock kii rayeesi ke alaava sushri spirs ke paas darasal he kya?" boston globe ke jone anderman ne tipanni qi he ki "90 minute main teraa poshaakon ke parivartanon se use madonna ke pratibha yaa saanskrithik barometer kaa aashirwad praapt nahin hoga
 kating-age R&B nirmaataaon kii sena, usamen jenet jackson kii hasya-bhaavana yaa gambhir-muskaan kii aapurti nahin karegi 


 britaini ke hero, mahaan gayak nahin hai
 But he is a real singer
 spirs kii awaz ko digital pich-shiftron or synthesiseron dwaara process kiya jaataa he, isliye uske records par, uske awaz robot kii tarah, lagbhag amanviya, lagati he
 Correspondent Ed Bumgardner commented on his transition from early teenager pop to his third studio album, Adult Sex Symbol with Brittany, which draws its cues from two other successful artists - Madonna and Janet Jackson - both of whom She shamelessly separates and both of whom, like Spears, are, in the best way, a good singer
 " aalochak shen harrison ne likhaa he: "aai'm e slave 4 you" ke minumelist thamp or "nasty" ke anubhav se lekar "boys" main bikhare hue uddharanon tak, 'control' main prayaas kii tarah lagati he
 "spears' nomenclature finally fades when compared, citing Jackson's resolve to include personal and social issues in her work and Madonna's ability to continually redefine the boundaries of socially acceptable content in the industry
 Falls because "where Jackson and Madonna composed their own music about topics of importance, the music 'I Do i want to grow up but the media will not let me, 'or' Here kitty, kitty, i think my underwear like an upbeat version of one of the ballads like worn out his leather pants
 " Madonna's reverence for Spears has also been a subject of comment
 madonna'sa dround varlds: new aprochs tu har cultural transformations, 1983-2003 ke lekhak, santiyago fouz-harnandis or freya jairman-evence note karte hai ki spirs or madonna ke bich sabase prasiddh cross-jenerational sambandh kaa astitv he jisamen "manoranjan ke samaacharon ke madhyam praayah unke paraspar prashansa ke sambandh se grast ho gaye hai
 "biographers also report", however, some observers in popular culture feel that comparisons between the two artists are meaningless and fail to identify Madonna's unique contribution: Madonna is never 'just another pop star' While not, Britney can very easily be seen as a standard-made pop artist
 " Soon after the launch of her recording career, Britney Spears became an icon of international pop culture

 a rotational compass or rotational compass is a compass that does not use a magnetic needle but is based on a fast-moving disk and the Earth's rotation speed

 The flotation method was used in the Anchuze's compass, the 'oil pump' in the Brown's compass and the method of balancing the sensory load in the Sperry's compass with a mechanical method
 ghurnakshasthapi diksuchak ke teen mukhya bhaag hote hai : Rotating on its axis at extremely high speed causes rotational axial inertia, due to which the axis always wants to remain in the same direction in which it is initially
 yadi isaki dhuree prarambh main prithvi ke yamyottar main rakhi jaay to ghurnak ke nartan karne par yah usee disha main bani rahanaa chaahegi
 Suppose the rotational compass is located at the equator
 prithvi ke ghurnan ke saath hi challa bhi pashchim se purv kii ore chalegaa
 If the rotor of the rotor is in the meridian of the earth, no force will work on the rotor, but if the direction of the spindle is also subtracted from the meridian, then an afferent force will be generated on it, which will start to propagate the axis of the meridian
 
 maan lijie, ghurnak kii nartan dhuree prithvi ke aksh kii disha se kuch vimukh he
 Its northern end is removed from the meridian, making some angle towards the west and the southern end is making the same angle towards the east
 prithvi ke ghurnan ke kaaran ghurnak ke nartan aksh kaa uttari sira neeche kii ore jhukne lagegaa or dakshini sira upar kii ore uthne lagegaa
 In this way, a forceful on the axis will start working automatically, which will appear to be working downwards at the northern end of the rotor and upwards at the southern end
 ghurnak ke ghurnan tathaa is pratikriyaatmak balyugma ke sammilit prabhaav se ghurnak kii dhuree apni praarambhik disha tathaa balyugma kii disha, donon ke lambavat, pashchim se purv kii ore purassaran karnaa aarambh kar degi
 The moment the rotator's axis passes parallel to the Earth's rotating axis while reversing, the position will reverse exactly because the upper end of the rotator's axis will move east and the southern end will move west
 falswaroop uttari sira upar uthne lagegaa or dakshini sira neeche dabane lagegaa
 In this case, the direction of the Balayugam on the axis will also be reversed as before and Narthandhuri will start from east to west
 purassaran kii is kriya par dhyaan dene se spasht ho jaayga ki ghurnak kii dhuree ek dirdhavritakar path par purassaran karti he
 If left in this way, it will continue to perform continuously and then it will work like an ordinary rotoscope
 ghurnak kii dhuree ko prithvi ke ghurnaksh ke samaantar, arthath uttar-dakshin disha main, banaae rakhane ke liye purassaran kii is kriya ko rokna aavashyak ho jaataa he
 For this, a suitable arrangement of damping is made in the rotational compass, whereby the axis of the rotor is oriented in the spiral path, finally fully oriented towards the north-south direction
 is avamandan vyavastha ke liy ghurnaksh diksuchak main saamanyatya paare main bhari hui ek ardhavritakar nalee us frem yaa challe main laga di jaati he jisamen vah ghurnak yaa paribhramanchakra latakta rahata he
 In the illustration above, suppose, in the order of precession, the northern tip of the rotor axis rises upwards and the southern end tilts downward
 isse paara us nalee ke unche bhaag se neeche bhaag kii ore bahane lagata he
 Thus he exerts a force around the horizontal axis of the rotor
 purassaran ke uparyukt siddhant ke anusaar, yah bal ghurnak ko urdhwadhar aksh ke chaaron ore tab tab ghumaane kii cheshtaa karata rahegaa jab tak ghurnak kii dhuree prithvi ke yamyottar nahin aa jaati
 As the axis of the pulverizer crosses the meridian direction, its opposite end will rise, due to which the flow of mercury will also start in the opposite direction
 is dhurnak kii dhuree vipareet disha main purassaran karke pun: yamyottar ho jaaygi; kintu purassaran kramash: ghatata jaataa he or antat: bilkul samaapt ho jaataa he, jisase ghurnak kii dhuree yamyottar disha main rah jaati he
 In rotational compasses that are handled in ships, the entire rotational system is charged on a set of rings in such a way that the rotating compass is not affected by the wavering of the vehicle or any change in its velocity etc

 With the success of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the establishment of communist rule in Russia, which gave the slogan of the best-ever revolution in the world and talked about the end of capitalism, since the birth of capitalist nations considered it their enemy, thus Soviet Union from the beginning
 Fallen from many enemies, Tanushree's harsh and fierce appearance was seen in Stalin's rule, under which the opponents of communism were suppressed and Nag Rick curbed freedom, the movement of people curbed the freedom of expression of newspapers and writers
 In this way, the system of governance of the Soviet Union as the ruler who enjoyed democracy, covered the spirit of the people and not just communist

 Plays in Hindi are thought to begin with Bharatendu Harishchandra
 us kaal ke bharatendu tathaa unke samakaleen naatakakaron ne lok chetana ke vikaas ke liye naatakon kii rachana kii isliye us samay kii saamaajik samasyaon ko naatakon main abhivyakt hone kaa acha avasar mila
 As has been said, the creation of non-commercial literary theater in Hindi can be considered from the geographical metaphor called 'inder Sabha' of 'amanat' Lakhanvi
 par sach to yah he ki ‘inder sabha’ kii vastav main rangamanchi kriti nahin thi
 It used to have an open stage under the canopy
 nautanki kii tarah teen ore darshak baithte the, ek ore takht par raja inder kaa asana laga diya jaataa tha, saath main pariyon ke liye kursiyaan rakhi jaati thim
 a scarlet curtain was hung behind the decorations
 isi ke peeche se paatro kaa pravesh karaayaa jaataa tha
 King Inder, fairies etc
 characters once came and were present there
 ve apane samvaad bolkar waapas nahin jate the
 At that time, Natyarangan became so popular that many meetings were organized following the 'inder Sabha' of Amanat, such as 'madarilal's Inder Sabha', 'daryai Inder Sabha', 'hawaiian Inder Sabha' etc
 parsi naatak mandaliyon ne bhi in sabhaaon or majaliseparistaan ko apanaaya
 These compositions were not plays, nor did they form the theater of Hindi
 isi se bharatendu harishchandr inako 'naatakabhas' kehete the
 He wrote 'bandar Sabha' as his parody
 is prakaar bharatendu se purv hindi rangamanch or natya-rachana ke vyavsaayik tathaa avyavsaayik saahitiyik prayaas to hue par hindi kaa vaastavik or sthaayee rangamanch nirmit or viksit nahin ho paaya tha
 From 1850 AD to 1868 AD, the rise and spread of Hindi theater took place but its elegant development and permanent construction could not take place
 parsi naatak mandaliyon ke atirikt kuch or bhi chhutput vyavsaayik mandaliyaan vibhinn sthanon par nirmit huin par saahitiyik suruchi sampannataa kaa unamem bhi abhaav hi rahaa
 The work that was done in the efforts of professional circles, the outline of Hindi theater , the work of publicity and dissemination, and the good dramatists who got Hindi because of them - the opportunity and situation could not be taken advantage of
 bharatendu ke naatak likhane kii shuruyaat bangala ke vidyasundar naatak ke anuwaad se hoti he
 Although plays were written even before them, Bhartendu strengthened the foundation of Hindi drama by regularly writing several plays in Khadiboli
 bharatendu ke purvavarti naatakakaron main reva naresh vishwanath singh ke brijbhasha main likhe gaye naatak 'anand raghunandan' or gopalchandra ke 'nahush' ko anek vidwaan hindi kaa pratham naatak maanate hai
 It may be interesting to know here that Gopalchandra was the father of Bharatendu Harishchandra
 hindi ke vishuddh saahitiyik rangamanch or natya-srijan kii parampara kii drushti se san 1868 i
 kaa bada mahatva he
 The play-writing and staging of Bharatendu began this year
 iske purv na to paatro ke pravesh-gaman, drishy-yojana aadi se yukt koi vaastavik naatak hindi main rachaa gaya tha
 Bhartendu's father Gopalchandar Chit 'nahusha' and Maharaj Vishwanath Singh's 'aandarghunandan' were also not complete plays, nor were a developed theater planned with curtains and scenes etc
; Most of the attempts of Natyarangan were also done in non-hindi speaking areas like Mumbai and the language was also a mixed slang form of hindi-urdu
 3 april san 1868 ko pan
 sheetalaprasad treepathi rachit 'janaki mangal' naatak kaa abhinay ‘banaras theatre’ main yojit kiya tha
 It is said that the boy who had to do the acting part of Laxman suddenly fell ill that day
 lakshmana ke abhinay kii samasya upasthit ho gai or us din yuvak bharatendu sthiti ko na sanbhaalate to natyyojan sthagit karnaa padataa
 In one-and-a-half hours, Bharatendu not only remembered his role of Laxman but also kept the entire 'janaki Mangal' drama in mind
 bharatendu ne apane abhijatya kii parvaah nahin kii
 In those days, people of high clans did not consider acting to suit their reputation
 is prakaar is naatak se bharatendu ne rangamanch par sakriy bhaag lenaa armbh kiya
 At the same time - he also started theatrical creation
 bharatendu ne san 1868 i
 se san 1885 i
 tak apane swalp or atyant vyast jivan se shesh 17 varshon main anek naatakon kaa srijan kiya, anek naatakon main swayan abhinay kiya, anek rangashalas nirmit karain or hindi rangamanch ke sthaapan kaa stuty prayaas kiya
 Not only this, many writers and Rangkarmis of Bharatendu inspired them for theatrical creation and acting
 bharatendu ke sadudyog evam prerana se kaashi, prayag, kanpur aadi kai sthanon par hindi kaa avyavsaayik saahitiyik rangamanch sthapit hua
 During the lifetime of Bharatendu, some of these colored institutions had been established: inke atirikt baliya, dumraanv, lakhanu aadi uttar pradesh ke kai sthanon or bihar pradesh main bhi hindi rangamanch or natya-srijan kii drudh parampara kaa nirmaan hua
 This question is of considerable importance from where Bhartendu and his fellow writers got the inspiration for theatrical creation
 is prashn kaa mahatva is drushti se or bhi bad jaataa he, jab ham dekhte hai ki hindi main natya-rachana kaa sutarapaat bharatendu kii hi nav-pravartankaree pratibha se hua
 Although there were some creation efforts in the Natya-style prior to Bharatendu, the actual form of the play first emerged from the authorship of Bharatendu
 astu, jab hindi main is saahitiyi-vidha kaa abhaav tha, to bharatendu ne natya-srijan kii prerana kahan se lee ? Looking for literary inspiration, it can be said that Bhartendu drew inspiration from Sanskrit and Prakrit's predecessor Indian theater-tradition and the English influence-stream with the contemporary theater of Bengali
 yadhyapi hamaare yahan bhaas, kalidaas, bhawabhooti, shudrak aadi purvavarti sanskrit naatakakaron kii samrudh natya-parampara vidyaman thi, par yah khed kii baat he ki bharatendu babu ne us samrudh sanskrit natya-parampara ko apane sammukh rakhaa
 In the prakrit-apabhramsa period, ie after the 9th-10th century AD, the Sanskrit drama became depressed
 praakrit or apbhransh main bhi natya-srijan vaisaa utkrisht nahin hua jaisaa purvavarti sanskrit-natya-sahitya tha
 Therefore, this predecessor of sanskrit-prakrit was a declining tradition in front of Bharatendu
 sanskrit ke murari, rajasekhar, jayadev aadi kii kramash: ‘anargharaaghav’, ‘balramayana’, ‘prasanraghav’ aadi rachanaayen hi bharatendu tathaa unke sahyogi lekhakon kaa adarsh baniin
 There was neither the seriousness of the story - or the content, which was in the immortal works of Kalidasa etc
, nor the superiority of the style-craft like them
 yahi kaaran he ki bharatendu-purv hindi naatak sarvatha nishpraan rahaa or yadhyapi bharatendu ne usamen samayik, saamaajik or saanskrithik jivan kii jhalak paidaa kar navonmesh or kinchit sapranata kaa prayaas kiya, par unke prayatnon ke baavjood bharatendukalin hindi naatak kathy or shilp donon kii hi drushti se shishav kaal main hi padaa rahaa, vishesh utkarsh ko praapt nahin hua
 In this way, through the Satyaprayan of Bharatendu Harishchandra, there was a strong tradition of Hindi literary theater and drama writing
 par san 1885 i
 main bharatendu ke nidhan ke pashchaat vah utsaah kuch mand pad gaya
 In the last decade of the 19th century, there were some small efforts again
 kai naatak mandaliyon kii sthapana hui, jaise prayag kii ‘shriramlila naatak mandali’ tathaa ‘hindi natya samiti’, bharatendu ji ke bhatijon- shrikrishnachandra or shri brajchandra-dwaara kaashi main sthapit ‘shri bharatendu naatak mandali’ tathaa ‘kaashi nagari naatak mandali
 Due to the efforts of these drama circles, many plays were performed at that time 'maharana Pratap', 'satya Harishchandra', 'mahabharata', 'subhadrashana', 'bhishmapitamah', 'bilv Mangal', 'sansar Swapna', 'kaliyug' etc
 
 par ye prayaas bhi bahut din nahin chal sake
 In the absence of wealth and governmental and non-governmental encouragement, efforts to establish literary theater all fell asleep over time
 in chhutput prayaason ke antargat tatkaaleen saahitiyik naatakon kaa abhinay hua or hindi main kuch achche rangamanchanukool saahitiyik naatakon kii rachana hui
 This attempt was a good answer to the ill effects of Parsi drama companies, but this effort was very voluntary
 duusare, is saahitiyik rangandolan se bhi hindi kaa rangamanch vishesh viksit nahin hua, kyonki yah rangamanch parsi rangamanch se vishesh bhinn or viksit nahin tha- vahi pardon kii yojana, vaisaa hi drishy-vidhaan or sangi aadi kaa prabandh rahata tha
 a theater revolving around scientific means could not be developed in the 19th century
 dhwani-yantra aadi kii sthapana ke prayaas bhi hindi rangamanch ke vikaas kii disha main koi mahatvapurn yoga nahin de paae
 Yes, they got the benefit that the corrupt propaganda of Parsi drama companies got some shock and some theater Hindi dramas came to light
 20 veen shatabdi ke tisare dashak main cinema ke aagaman ne parsi rangamanch ko sarvatha samaapt kar diya
 But the unconventional theater survived in new forms here and there
 ab hindi kaa rangamanch keval skulon or collejon main hi he
 This theater went on to adopt units more than big plays
 iske do mukhya kaaran hai- ek to aaj kaa darshak kam-se-kam samay main apane manoranjan kii purti karnaa chahta he, duusare, aayojakon ke liye bhi bade naatak kaa pradarshan yahaan bahut kathinaayee utpann karata he vahaan ekanki kaa pradarshan saral he-rangamanch, drishy-vidhaan aadi ekanki main saral hote hai, paatr bhi bahut kam rahete hai
 Therefore, in all the schools, cultural events, etc
, only the units are displayed
 dow ram kumaar verma, upendranath ashk, seth govind das, jagadishchandra maathur aadi hamaare anek naatakakaron ne sundar abhinay-upyogi ekanki naatakon tathaa deergh naatakon kii rachana kii he
 Prasad ji had enriched Hindi drama literature by creating high quality literary dramas, but many dramas used to create some difficulty in theater
 phir bhi kuch kaat-chhant ke saath prasad ji ke praaia: sabhi naatakon kaa abhinay hindi ke avyavsaayik rangamanch par hua
 Under the influence of Western playwrights like George Bernard Shaw, Ibsen, the above-mentioned Prasad modern dramatists created some very beautiful stage plays
 in naatakakaron ke anek puure naatak bhi rangamanchon se pradarshit hue
 After independence, many government-non-governmental efforts have been made towards permanent construction of Hindi theater
 sarkaar kii ore se bhi kai gaiyr-sarkari sansthaaon ko rangamanch kii sthapana ke liye aarthik sahaayta mili he
 Along with men, women too have started participating in acting
 skulon-collejon main kuch achche naatakon kaa ab acha pradarshan hone laga he
 Some good permanent theaters associated with many socio-cultural institutions have been established, such as permanent theaters are established in places like Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, Allahabad, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Shantiniketan etc
 under the aegis of Theater Center
 kendriya sarkaar bhi is ore paryaapt dhyaan de rahi he
 But Hindi seems to be beggar-like at these linguistic theaters
 kendriya sarkaar ne sangeet naatak academy kii sthapana kii he, jisamen achche naatakakaron or kalakaaron ko protsaahan diya jaataa he
 Some efforts have also been made in the last few days to build a commercial theater
 prasiddh kalakaar swargeey prithviraj kapur ne kuch varsh hue prithvi theatre kii sthapana kii thi
 He has produced many plays, such as 'dawar', 'gaddar', 'pathan', 'artist', 'ahuti' etc
 dhan kii haani uthaakar bhi kuch varsh is company ne utsaahpurvak acha kaary kiya
 But even after so much effort, there has not been a permanent commercial theater of Hindi in Bombay, Delhi or elsewhere

 Thinking of the guru-disciple relationship, Tagore studied the problems of the modern teenager with a warm heart and expressed his strong conviction that the rigorous discipline of prisons and military barracks could not serve to remove the indiscipline prevalent in educational institutions
 So the reputation of teachers will also be hurt
 vidhyaarthiyon se yah aashaa karnaa hi galat he ve adhyapakon se vaisaa hi vyavhaar karen jaisaa kisi samant ke darbari karte hai

 Built in the 1190s, the tower is covered with bricks, stucco plaster and tiles, which have verses of Quran and attractive ridges and shapes
 mana jaataa he ki minar-e-jam gori rajvansh kii greeshmakaleen rajdhani firuzakuh ke paas banavaai gai thi
 On this, the date on the writings made in Arabic language cannot be read properly
 yaa to yah san 1193-94 kaa zikr kar rahi he, yaa phir san 1174-75 kaa
 Therefore, it was either a commemoration of Ghoris Sultan Ghiyasuddin's victory over the Ghaznavites in Delhi in 1192 or the victory over the Guj Turks in Ghazni in 1173 AD
 12veen or 13veen sadi main gori rajvansh kaa samrajya purvi iran se lekar uttar bharat main dilli tak failaa hua tha
 According to the medieval writer Juzjani, who narrated the Ghori dynasty, the tower was associated with the Jumma Mosque situated at this place, but the mosque swept away due to sudden inundation in the river
 itihaaskaaron ne yahan chaanbin karke paaya he ki masjid ke saath ek bada aangan sata hua he jo sambhav he usee masjid kaa hissaa rahaa ho
 After the death of Ghiyasuddin in 1202, the empire of the Ghurids began to collapse and they lost their lands to the Khwareism empire
 juljani kaa kahana he ki 1222 main mongol akraman ne phiruzakuh shahar ko khatm kar diya
 The world outside Afghanistan did not know much about this tower, but in 1886, Thomas Holadik, an officer associated with the British Raj of India, arrived here and mentioned it in his report
 20veen sadi main kai itihaaskaaron ne aakar iskaa adhyayan kiya
 Due to being near the green river and the jam river, the water below it loses water, due to which the tower is starting to get crooked
 ise sthir karne kaa kaam jari he
 Zalzle also comes in this area and that too is a danger
 samay ke saath-saath luteron or baimaan itihaaskaaron ne bhi iske aasapaas bina anumati ke khudaai karke nuksaan pahunchaaya he

 jayadev, utkal rajya yani odisha ke gajpati raajaaon ke samakaleen the
 Jayadeva was revered as a Vaishnava devotee and saint
 unki kriti ‘geet govind’ ko shrimadbhagwat ke baad radhakrishna kii lila kii anupam sahitya-abhivyakti mana gaya he
 He was also the last poet in the tradition of Sanskrit poets, who composed the melodious songs of the Sanskrit language as 'geet Govind'
 kaha gaya he ki jayadev ne divya ras ke swaroop radhakrishna kii ramanalila kaa stvan kar aatmshaanti kii siddhi kii
 Saint Mahipati, the creator of Bhakti Vijay, has considered Jayadeva as the incarnation of Srimad Bhagavatakara Vyasa
 ‘bhaktamaal’ ke lekhak nabhadas ne brajabhasha main jayadev kii prashansa karte hue likhaa he- Jayadeva propagated the Radhakrishna Vaishnavism, through 'geet Govind'
 isliye ‘geet govind’ ko vaishnav sadhana main bhakthiras kaa shaastra kaha gaya he
 Through 'geet Govind', Jayadeva enlivened the hearts of the people with the sentimentality and plausibility of Radhakrishna's juicy pastimes through the spirit of society at that time, which was entangled in spirit and mysticism as per Shankaracharya's principle

 By elaborating or a little consideration, the veracity of the following rules can be proved: stambh-pankti-parivartan-sabhi stambhon ko panktiyon main is prakaar parivartit karne se ki mawaan stambh badalakar mavin pankti ban jaae, saaranik kaa maan nahin badalata
 Conversely: Changing the rows in columns according to the aforesaid rule also does not change the value of the determinant

 American football is a popular sport played between two teams of eleven players, in which each team aims to score points by placing the ball in the other team's "end zone"
 jis team ke paas gend par qabza hota he, vah gend ke saath daudkar yaa apane saathiyon main aapas main gend phenkakar use virdohi team ke oundzon tak badhaane kii koshish karti he
 If a player from that team crosses the goal line by holding the ball and reaches the opposing endzone, or successfully catches the ball thrown by his partner standing inside the endzone or two behind the goal line from the field If he delivers the ball by kicking it between the poles, then his team gets points
 virdohi team kaa kaam he ki takkar markar, giraakar, yaa bich main aakar phenki gai gend ko pakadakar kisi tarah gend par qabza kare yaa dushman team ko apni team ke oundzon kii taraf badhane se roke
 American football is played mostly in the United States and Canada

 In the US, there are two main forms of the sport, college football and professional football, whose rules differ slightly from one another

 The playground is 100 ghz long and 53

 maidan kii lambaai ke donon taraf ek gol kii lakeer hoti he, jiske aage das-das gaz ke oundzon hote hai, yani kul milakar maidan kii lambaai 120 gaz hoti he
 There is a streak called Yardline at every five Gaz distances in the field
 har oundzon ke akhir main zamin se 10 foot kii oonchaai par do khambe hote hai jinhen "goalpost" kaha jaataa he
 Every team can have 11 players on the field at any time, but teams have the right to change one or all of their players at any given time in the game
 isliye footbaal ek visheshgy khilaadiyon kaa khel he
 In any team, there are actually many players, which are divided into three types: the attacking player, the defending player and the special player
 kuch khilaadi to tiimon main sirf isliye rakhe jaate hai ki agar unke hi hunar vaale kisi khilaadi ko chot lag jaae to unhen unke sthaan par daalaa ja sake
 In most cases, many players of any team do not get the chance to get into the field
 jis team ke paas gend par qabza ho, use "aakraamak" bulaayaa jaataa he or jis ke paas na ho use "rakshak" bulaayaa jaataa he
 The most important player on the offensive team is called the quarterback
 jab akramak or rakshakon main bhidnt shuru karti he to isi kaa kaam he ki tezi se maidan kaa muina karke faisalaa kare ki akramak team kaa koun-sa khilaadi gend ko rakshak team ke oundzon kii taraf badhaane ke liye sabase acchhee sthiti main maujuud he
 Then the quarterback tosses the ball to him, or himself runs away and tries to push the ball forward
 khel kaa puraa samay ek ghanta hota he, jise chaar 15 minute ki chauthaiyon main baanta jaataa he
 The second quarter is followed by a 12-minute break
 khelte hue kai baar gend ruk jaati he or tab khel kii ghadi bhi roak di jaati he
 a quarter of 15 minutes can actually take more than 45 minutes, and a full one-hour game can actually run more than three hours
 jab khel television par prasaarit hota he to in antaraalon main prasarankarta ishtehaar dikhaate hai
 At the beginning of the match, the coin is tossed and a team is declared an offensive team and they are given the ball
 ab 50 gaz kii lakeer par donon timen ek dusre se bhidane ke liye aamane-saamne lakeeren banaakar khadi ho jaati hai
 The quarterback of the offensive team stands behind his team
 maahaul thik aisa hota he ki do gut jang ke liye taiyaar ho rahe hon
 The game begins when the ball reaches the hands of the offensive quarterback
 foran rakshak team ke khilaadi us tak pahunch kar use dhane kii ziddo-jahad main lag jate hai
 Some aggressive players try to stop them by confronting them, while the rest of the aggressors enter the opponent's field and try to put themselves in a good position to move the ball forward
 quarterbaque ke paas kuch hi kshan hote hai jisamen use faisalaa karnaa hota he: kis saathi ko gend phenken yaa phir khud rasta dhundta hua aage bhaage
 In a few moments, the defending players of the count, who defend him, reach the quarterback by banging or pushing them
 agar gend quarterbaque ke haath main ho or use daboch diya jaae to ise "sac" kehete hai or kisi bhi quarterbaque ke liye yah bahut sharmnaak mana jaataa he
 Being sacked more often means that the quarterback was unable to think between skirmishes: he is weak and not capable of leading the aggressors
 chaahe quarterbaque gend kisi ko phenke, chaahe khud use lekar bade, aam taur se rakshak thodi hi duuri par gendwale aakraamak khilaadi ko dha hi lete hai or gend ruk jaati he
 This condition is called down
 aakraamakon kaa kaam he kii 4 dounon main gend ko kam-se-kam 10 gaz badhayen
 If they cannot do so, the defenders are taken possession of the ball and the defenders now become aggressive and the offensive defenders
 gend kaa qabza tab bhi badal jaataa he agar kisi aakraamak ke haath se khelte hue gend chhot jaae or koi rakshak us hilti hue gend ko pakad le yaa phir quarterbaque kisi anya aakraamak khilaadi ko gend phenke or koi rakshak bich main aakar use pakad le 
 In the event of a fumble or interception, the defender who has caught the ball may immediately start running towards the opponent's endzone and run until it is dropped, pushed out of the ground, or he Do not score points for your team by reaching the endzone
 jab gend ruukti he to yah bade dhyaan se mapa jaataa he kii 100 gaz ke maidan main yah kaunse gaz par he
 The next play is started in the middle of the field at the same Ghaz
 is jagah ko "bhidane kii lakeer" kaha jaataa he
 As stated, the aim of the offensive team is that the ball moves 10 yards in four or less downs
 farz kijiye ke ve do hi dounon main gend ko 10 gaz aage badha len
 So it is said that he is again on the first down and now he has to raise the ball 10 yards in four downs again with this new scrimmage streak
 yah silsilaa tab tak chalata he jab tak aakraamak rakshakon ke oundzon tak na pahunch jaaen yaa galati karke virdohi ko gend kaa qabza na de den
 Players are also changed in the game which is interrupted when the occupation is changed
 bahut se aakraamak khilaadi daudane main or phenki gai gend pakadaney main nipun hote hai or aksar unke sharir halake hote hai
 Many defenders are terrific and most offensive-specific players are difficult to pick up if they are caught or slammed
 acha aakraamak vahi he jise quarterbaque dwaara phenki gai gend ko bina galati ke pakadana aata ho or jo bhaagate hue rakshakon ko chakma dete hue dushman ke kshetra main dur tak gend badha sake
 The job of some aggressors is to take on defenders so that others can take the offensive ball forward
 inkaa naam hi "oinsive tekal" hota he

 mahadevi ke geeton kii vednaa, pranyanubhuti, karunaa or rahasyavaad kavyanuragiyon ko aakarshith karte hai
 But the anti-criticisms of these works confuse the general reader
 aalochakon kaa ek varg vah he, jo yah maanakar chalate hai ki mahadevi kaa kavy nitant vaiyaktik he
 His agony, anguish, compassion, is artificial and artificial
 yah sach he ki mahadevi kaa kavy sansar chhayavaad kii paridhi main aata he, par unke kavy ko unke yug se ekadam asamprukt karke dekhnaa, unke saath anyaay karnaa hoga
 Mahadevi is a conscious creator
 bengal ke akaal ke samay 1943 main inhone ek kavy sankalan prakashit kiya tha or bengal se sambandhit “bang bhu shat vandana” naamak kavita bhi likhi thi
 Similarly, in response to the invasion of China, a collection of poems called Himalaya was edited

 His speeches were full of compassion for the common man and firm in the truth
 ve dilli main 1983 main yojit tisare vishwa hindi sammelan ke samaapan samaaroh kii mukhya atithi thim
 This quality of his can be seen in his speech given on this occasion
 yadhyapi mahadevi ne koi upanyaas, kahani yaa naatak nahin likhaa to bhi unke lekh, niabandh, rekhachitr, sansmaran, bhoomikaaon or lalit nibandhon main jo gadhy likhaa he vah shreshthatam gadhy kaa utkrisht udhaaharan he
 There is complete diversity in life
 bina kalpana or kavyarupon kaa sahaara liye koi rachanaakaar gadhy main kitna kuch arjeet kar saktaa he, yah mahadevi ko padhakar hi janaa ja saktaa he
 The ideological maturity in his prose is so relevant that it is still relevant today
 samaaj sudhaar or nari swatantraaa se sambandhit unke vichaaron main dridhtaa or vikaas kaa anupam saamanjasy miltaa he
 Such a sharp vision touching the deepest layers of social life, such a conscious talent to sharply assess the contrast and exploitation of women life, and the unique pictures of the inferior, resourceless beings of the lower class, gave Hindi literature for the first time
 moulik rachanaakaar ke alaava unka ek rup srujanaatmak anuvadak kaa bhi he jiske darshan unki anuwaad-krit ‘saptaparna’ main hote hai
 With the help of his cultural consciousness, he has introduced Hindi poetry in 39 works by identifying Vedas, Ramayana, Theragatha and 39 selected important parts by establishing the works of Ashwaghosh, Kalidas, Bhavabhuti and Jayadeva
 aarambh main 61 prishthiya ‘apni baat’ main unhone bhartiya manisha or sahitya kii is amuly dharohar ke sambandh main gahan shodhapurna vimarsh kiya he jo keval stri-lekhan ko hi nahin hindi ke samgr chintanaparak or lalit lekhan ko samrudh karata he

 ise america ke sarkari vidyalayon main intellegent dizine or crieshnism padhaane kaa virodh karne ke liye san 2005 main banaaya gaya tha
 Through this, it is shown that the burden of philosophical proof is on the person who is making a scientifically unjustifiable claim, rather than the person who is rejecting that claim
 haalanki is dharm ke anuyaayi ise ek asli dharm bataate hai, par media main ise ek vyangy dharm kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 The first description of the flying Spaghetti monster is found in a satirical letter written in 2005 by Bobby Henderson to the Board of Education of the State of Kansas, USA
 is chitthee se ve board dwaara vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas ke sthaan par intellegent dizine padhaane kii anumati die jane kaa virodh kar rahe the
 In the letter, he satirizes Creationism by asserting his faith in a deity that looks like spaghetti and meatballs and the creator of the universe
 ve tark karte hai ki unki dharanaayen intellegent dizine kii dharanaon ke jitani vaid hai, or kehete hai ki isliye unki dharanaon ko vigyaan kii kakshaon main kram-vikaas or intellegent dizine ke baraabar samay milanaa chahie
 The flying Spaghetti demon is often used as a contemporary adaptation of Russell's teapot due to its popularity and reach
 iske madhyam se ye darshaya jaataa he ki darshanashastriy saboot kaa boj us vyakti par he jo vaigyanik drushti se jhoothaya na ja sakane vaala daawa kar rahaa ho, bajaay us vyakti ke jo us daawey ko asweekaar kar rahaa ho
 Although Henderson states that "the same religion is allowed in Pastafari religion - disallowance of religious beliefs", yet Pastafari people hold some beliefs
 pastafaari srijan myth ke anusaar ek adrishy or anbhigyeya udanevaale spagetti daanav ne bahut zyada sharaab pine ke baad brahmand kii rachana das hajaar varsh pehle kii thi
 According to these beliefs, the reason for the Earth to be flawed is the drunkenness of this demon during creation
 pastafaari ye bhi maanate hai ki kram-vikaas ke sabhi saboot pastafaariyon kii shraddha jaanchane ke liye swayan udanevaale spagetti daanav ne rakhe the
 When scientific measurements, such as radiocarbon dating, are taken, the flying Spaghetti transforms the demon figures so that scientists understand that the Earth is billions of years old
 pastafaari dharm kii swarg kii sankalpana main ek bear jwalamukhi or nagn nartakiyaan banane vaala kaarkaana shaamil he
 
 pastafaari nark bhi aisa hi he, par bear basi he or nartkiyon ko yon sanchaarit rog hai
 According to pastoral beliefs, pirates are in reality celestial beings and original pastoralists
 pastafaari maanate hai ki samudri luteron ke "chor or bahishkrut" hone kii dharna madhyayug main isai dharamshastriyon dwaara or aaj antarrashtriya krishnabhaavnamrita sangh dwaara failaai ja rahi juthi soochna kaa nateeja he
 According to them, in reality the pirates were "peace-loving travelers and disseminators of harmony" who distributed sweets to children
 ye kehete hai ki aaj ke samudri luteron kaa "pracheen jindadil samudri lutrron" se koi sambandh nahin he
 Additionally, Pastafari holds the ghosts of pirates responsible for the mysterious disappearance of marine and airplanes from the Bermuda Triangle
 pastafaari har varsh 19 sitambar ko "samudri luteron kii tarah bolo kaa antarrashtriya diwas" manaate hai

 vibhinn prakaar ke yon prajnano jaise anesogami or ugami main ek chihnit antar he, jisamen chote aakaar ke yugmakon ko 'nar' yaa shukranu koshika kaha jaataa he
 Male sperm are haploid, so the male's 23 trait formulas can form a diploid with 23 chromosomes of the female's ovum
 ek maanav shukranu cell ke arevvadhi shukranu unani shabd sperma se lee gai he or purush prajnan koshikaon ko sanderbhit karata he
 In the type of sexual reproduction known as anisogamy and oogamy, there is a clear difference in the size of gametes with one being called the small "male" or sperm cell

 Sperm cells can divide and have a limited life span, but after merging with egg cells during fertilization, the development of a new organism begins as a totipotent zygote, so that the human sperm cell is haploid Can include in its 23 chromosomes

 Sperm in plants kaai or kai sanyantr gametophytes main shukranu koshikaon purush gametangia main mitotic prabhag ke madhyam utpaadit kar rahe hai
 In flowering plants, pollen sperm are produced inside the pollen
 Dynamic sperm cells shaiwal kii motile shukranu koshikaon or bijrahit paudhon
 Dynamic sperm cells move normally through the flagella and require a water medium in order to swim towards the egg for fertilization
 Much of the energy for motility of sperm in animals is derived from fructose metabolism made in seminal fluid
 yah shukranu midpiece main sthit mitochondria main jagah letaa he
 These cells cannot swim backward due to the nature of their propulsion
 pashuon kii uniflagellated shukranu koshikaon shukranu ke rup main sanderbhit kar rahe hai, kar rahe hai or aakaar main bhinnata ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Dynamic sperm are also produced by many protists and gametophytes of some gymnosperms such as bryophytes, ferns and cicadas and ginkgo

gaiyr gatisheel shukranu koshikaon Non-motile sperm cells lacking spermatia called flagella and therefore cannot swim
 Spermatia ek spermatangium main utpaadit kar rahe hai
 Because spermatia cannot swim, they depend on the environment for them to carry them to the egg cell

 Fungal spermatia may be confused with conidia
 Conidia spores ki nishechan kii swatantra rup se ugna, jabaki spermatia gametes ki nishechan ke liye aavashyak hai
 Some fungi, such as Neurospora crassa, resemble spermatia microconidia as they may perform both functions of fertilization as well as giving rise to new organisms without fertilization
 shukranu nabhik In many land plants, including most gymnosperms and all angiosperms, the male gametophytes primary mode of propagation, for example through wind or insect pollination, bridges the gap between man and woman to destroy the need for water
 Each pollen is comprised of a spermatogenic cell
 ek baar ek grahanshil phool ke kalank par paraag bhoomi, yah ankurit or capel ke madhyam se ek paraag tub se bad shuru hota he
 Before the tube reaches the ovule, the nucleus of the generative cell divides into pollen grains and gives rise to two sperm nuclei which then discharge through the tube into the ovule for fertilization
 In some protists, fertilization also involves nuclei instead of sperm cells, a fertilization tube
 The migration through the egg cell is involved
