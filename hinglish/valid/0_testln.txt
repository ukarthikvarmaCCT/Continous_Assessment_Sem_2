 a partial or complete solid-solution of two or more metallic elements is called a mishratu or alloy
 ispaat ek mishra dhaatu he
 Often the properties of alloys differ from the properties of the components that make up that alloy
 ispaat, lohe kii apeksha adhik majboot hota he
 Mishratu is bronze, brass, stitch etc
 mishradhatu vyapak rup main ek aisa shabd he jiskaa prayog kisi bhi dhatvik vastu ke liye hota he, basharte vah rasinic tatv na ho
 The art of alloying is very ancient
 satya to yah he ki kaanse kaa mahatv ek yug main itnaa adhik tha ki maanav sabhyataa ke vikaas ke us yug kaa naam hi 'kaansya yug' pad gaya he
 Although pure metals have many useful properties, such as the conductivity of heat and electricity, pure metals are not commonly used in mechanical and manufacturing operations, because they do not have the necessary strength
 dhaatu ko adhik majboot banane kii sabase mahatvapurn vidhi dhaatumishran he
 a lot of effort was made in this direction in the 19th century, the result of this is that more than five thousand alloys are available for many useful works today and new innovations are being done constantly to prepare new alloys
 aaj kisi vishesh upyog ke liye icchit gunonvali mishradhatuen banaai jaati he
 When metals dissolve in a common solution, such as an acid, they give off their metallic properties and normally form salts, but when melted they dissolve along with their metallic properties
 dhaatuon ke aise thos vilyan ko mishradhatu kehete hai
 Non-metals are also small in many alloys, but the quality of the whole remains metallic
 at: 1939 i0 main america vastu pareekshak parishad ne mishradhatu kii nimnlikhit paribhaasha kii- Initially, the alloy was used most for making coins and ornaments
 taanbe ke sikkon main tanba, tin or jasta kramash: 95 / 4 tathaa 1 pratishat rahete hai
 Until 1920, silver coins in England were made of 'sterling' silver, with silver and copper being 92
5 and 7
5 percent respectively
 america main chaandi ke sabhi sikkon main chaandi or tanba kramash: 90 tathaa 10 pratishat hote hai
 Gold and copper in England's gold coins are 91
67 and 8
33 percent respectively, and gold coins in the United States are 90 percent gold and other metals, especially copper
 platinayam, sona tathaa chaandi ke aabhushanon ke rango main sundarataa laane ke liye unako kathor, majboot tathaa tikaoo banane ke liye, yaa unhen saste mulyon main vikray ke liye duusari dhaatuon ke saath milakar kaam main laate hai
 Determining whether alloys are simple mixtures or chemical compounds is a complex problem
 kuch arthon main ye rasinic yogic hai, kyonki jab sodium saras banaaya jaataa he, tab sodium ke har ek tukade ko paar main daalane se prakaash kii teevr jwaala nikalati he or paara garam ho jaataa he, yah yogic banane kaa lakshan he
 Similarly, when a piece of aluminum metal is added to the melting gold, so much heat is generated that the entire molten metal becomes brighter
 anek mishra dhaatuon kaa rang apane avyav dhaatuon ke rangon se bilkul bhinn hota he
 For example, both silver and zinc are white, but the alloy they make is very beautiful pink
 sona pilaa or aluminium shwet hota he, kintu inaki mishradhatu kaa rang ati chamkila nillohit hota he
 This property also has compounds
 mishradhaatuon ke galnaank nikaalane par gyaat hua he ki mishra dhaatuon kaa vyavhaar do prakaar kaa he: kuch mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank jaise jaise kisi avyav dhaatu kii maatra badalati hai vaise-vaise badalata he, yah mishran kaa gun he or kuch mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank ek sthir taap hota he, jo prakat karata he ki mishradhatuen yogic hai
 The physical and chemical properties of alloys differ from the properties of their constituent metals, and the properties of alloys are by no means comparable to the properties of element metals
 yah bhinnata is kaaran se he ki jab dhaatuon ko ek saath pighalaate hai, tab ve kitne hi antaradhaatuk yogic tathaa thos vilyan banaati hai
 The density of an alloy can be less or greater than the mean density of its constituent metals
 kuch mishradhaatuon kaa rang apni avyav dhaatuon ke rangon se bilkul hi bhinn hota he
 They are harder than their constituent metals, but less flexible and malleable and more brittle
 mishradhaatuon kaa galnaank sarvada adhiktam taap par pighalanevaali avyavdhaatu ke galnaank se bhi kam hota he
 And usually at a minimum temperature the melting element is less than the melting point of the metal
 udaahranarth, ek mishradhatu, jisamen sisa, tin, bismuth tathaa cadmium hai, 75 ̊sein0 par galati he, jab ki nunatam taap par pighalane vaali avyav-dhaatu, tin kaa galnaank 232 ̊ sein0 he
 All these are the properties due to which alloys become more valuable than pure metals and prove more useful in industry
 upar varnit falon dwaara tathaa sookshmdarshi, eks-kiran varnakram maapi, ooshmiya tathaa rasinic vishleshan or duusare bhautik pareekshanon dwaara mishradhaaton ke sanghathan tathaa crystalia rachana ke vistrut adhyayan ke parinamswaroop, mishradhaatuon ko teen shreniyon main rakhaa gaya he
 This division has been done on the basis of how the group of atoms of the constituent metals in the alloys is organized
 ye teen shreniyan nimnlikhit hai: In these types of alloys, when the element metals are molten, they dissolve in each other, but when solid, the crystals of the metals break apart, that is, the metals are insoluble
 is prakaar mishradhatu prayek avyav dhaatu ke shuddh crystal kaa mishran hoti he or thanda karne par koi ek avyav dhaatu thos rup main pruthak ho jaati he
 For example, a liquid alloy consisting of only 10 parts lead and 90 parts tin, when cooled, pure tin crystals are first separated in the same way as pure ice crystals cooled from a dilute solution of sugar
 Are separate jis taap par tin ke crystal pruthak hona prarambh karte he, vah taap shuddh tin ke galnaank se kam hota he
 When the melting point of the tin is dissolved in the lead, the molecular weight of the lead is determined by the same rule by which the molecules of the dissolved substances in the water are removed
 is vidhi se un kai dhaatuon kaa anubhaar nikaala gaya he, jo tanughatvik vilyan main alag parmaanu ke rup main rahati he
 Lead-antimony alloys belong to the mixture category
 antimony bhangur hota he or sisa mulaayam
 The printing metal is a alloy of CC, antimony and a very small amount of tin
 is mishradhatu main antimony kii kathorta to hoti he, kintu yah uski tarah bhangur nahin hoti
 In this type of alloys, the atoms of one element metal fit well in the crystalline structure of the other element metal
 thos vilyan shrenee kii mishradhatuen do bhinn prakaar kii hoti he: Many copper-nickel alloys that have significant use fall under the category of solid solutions
 udaahranarth, ve mishradhatuen jinase nikal ke sikke, rifl kii goliyon kii tapiyaan or ek taar jiskaa vaidyut pratirodh adhik hota he, banataa he
 Many of the Canadian minerals contain copper and nickel sulfides, which are smelted to form an alloy
 isamen nikal or tanba kramash: 67 or 28 pratishat tathaa shesh paanch pratishat main loha or manganeez hote hai
 This alloy is called monel metal
 yah adhik tanya, lacheelee tathaa sanksharan pratirohak hoti he
 Generally, metals do not form compounds by mixing with each other, but by heat analysis it has been found that metals combine with each other to form a large number of compounds
 in yogicon kaa vargeey naam antaradhaatuk yogic he
 Most compounds of this type form alkali and alkaline clay metals, by combining them with the metals of the odd subclass of the periodic table
 in yogicon main dhaatuen kis maatra main mili hui hai, isko rasinic sutron dwaara darshaate hai
 It is known from the study of these formulas that these types of compounds violate all the laws of valency that are formed by the compounds formed by the combination of metals and non-metals
 udaahranarth, sodium, tin or sisa ke saath rasinic kriya kar nimnlikhit yogic banaata he : Many interstitial compounds are very stable and do not dissolve their constituents in metals even when heated to temperatures higher than their melting point
 ye yogic taral ammonia main ghulte hai or is prakaar se jo vilyan taiyaar hota he, vah vaidyut chaalak hota he
 When they are electrically decomposed, one component metal, which is less positive than the other, accumulates on the positive and the other on the minuscule
 antaradhaatuk yogic kyon banaata he, isaki abhi tak saidhantik vyakhya nahin hui
 Only so far it has been proved that those metals, which have the same properties, do not coincide with each other
 chunki is prakaar kii mishradhatuen kathor, bhangur, bahut hi kam tanyashil tathaa lacheelee hoti hai, at: inamen se keval kuch hi upyogi hai

 The LCA program was launched in 1983 for two primary purposes
 pramukh or sabase spasht lakshya bharat ke puraane padate ja rahe mikoyan-gurevitch mig-21 kii jagah lene vaale vimaan kaa vikaas karnaa tha
 The mig-21 has been the mainstay of the Indian Air Force since the 1970s, but the early examples became around 20 years old in 1983
 "laung turm ri-equipment plan 1981" ke jariye yah darj hua ki 1990 ke dashak ke ant tak mig-21 ke seva jivan kaa ant ho jaayegaa or 1995 tak bhartiya vaayu sena ko apane bal kii anumaanit dhanchaagat jaruraton ko puraa karne ke liye 40% vimaanon kii kami padegi
 The other main objective of the LCA program was to act as a carrier for the all-round growth of India's domestic aerospace industry
 1947 main swatantraaa milane ke turant baad, bhartiya netaaon ne vimaanan or anya samrik udyogon main aatmanirbharta kaayam karne kaa ek mahatvakankshi rashtriya lakshya nirdhaarit kiya
 The importance of aerospace "self-reliance" initiatives is not only to build an aircraft, but to enable the local industry to manufacture state of art products and equip them with commercial recognition in the global market
 elsie kaarykram kaa uddeshy aadhunik uddyan praudyogikiyon ke vistrut daayre main bharat ke swadeshi airospes kshamtaaon ko or vistaarit karnaa or samunnat karnaa he
 To better meet these goals, the government has decided to adopt a different approach to management and established the Aeronautical Development Agency in 1984 to manage the LCA program
 haalanki, tejas ko aksar hindustan aironautics limited kaa utpaada kaha jaataa rahaa he, par tejas ke vikaas kii jimmedaari vastav main ada kii he, jo 100 se adhik raksha prayogshaalaon, audyogic sanghathanon or academik sansthaanon kaa ek rashtriya sangh he or hieli jiskaa mukhya thekedaar he

 Although India follows a policy of severely restricting foreign participation in the LCA program, only in respect of Hieli's key systems has Ada invited significant foreign technical assistance and consultation
 iske alaava, ingine or radar hi keval pramukh pranaliyaan hai, jinke sambandh main kida ne gambhirtha se videshi upkaran pratisthapann kii baat sochi, haalanki yah shuruaati elsie vimaan ke liye uthaaye gayi antarim upaay the, jisamen deshi sanskaran ke purna vikaas ke liye or adhik samay kii jarurut thi, jaisaa ki elsie kaveri bijli sanyantr ke maamle main hua tha
 With a view to achieving self-sufficiency in the field of aviation technologies, the ambition of the LCA program is highlighted by the fact that only three of the top 35 aviation equipment and line replaceable units include foreign systems

 In the shadow of the problems that have come in the way of the other three major technology initiatives, most of these achievements have not gone unnoticed
 baharhaal, bharat ke gharelu udyogon kii kamyaabiyon ke parinamswaroop elsie ke 70 pratishat purje bharat main ban rahe hai or aane vaale varshon main aaayaatit upkarnon ke upyog par bharat kii nirbharta dhire-dhire kam ho jaayegi
 In 1955, Hieli took on the challenge of an air staff requirement based on the experience gained from the HT-2 program and the manufacturing capabilities gained from the licensed production of the De Havilland Vampire FB
52 and T
55
 isse kai bhoomikaaon vaale ek ladaaku vimaan kii aavashyaktaa mahasoos hui jo zyada oonchai par avarodhan kar sake or kam duuri par rah kar jamini hamale ke liye upyukt ho
 The ASR also required that the infrastructure be suitable as an advanced trainer and for ship operation optimization, although this option was later abandoned
 parinamswaroop bharat ke pehle gharelu viksit jet ladaaku, sabsonic HF-24 maarut kaa nirmaan hua, jisane sabase pehle june 1961 main udaan bhari
 Marut could not be inducted into the Indian Air Force until 1967 due to problems in developing and acquiring a suitable turbojet engine
 Meanwhile, Hieli gained additional experience developing and testing the Holland Genat F
1, which was under production license from 1962 to 1974, which led to a later improved version of the Genat Mk II Ajit HJT-16 Kiran turbojet trainer
 Developed, which was incorporated into service in 1968
 1969 main, bharat sarkaar ne apni aironautics samiti kii is sifarish ko sweekaar kar liya ki hieli ko ek kshamta sabit kar chuke ingine ke saath unnat praudyogiki vaale ladaaku vimaan sanrachana va viksit karne chahie
 'tactical air saport aircraft` ke aadhaar par ASR chihnit rup main maarut jaisaa hi tha
 Hieli then completed a study of the structure in 1975, but the project could not be completed due to an inability to obtain "capability proven engines" selected from foreign manufacturers
 chunki ajit atake vimaan kaa utpaadan jari he, jisase hieli ke ejiniyaron ke liye sanrachana kaa kaam thodaa hi bachaa, jabaki madhyamik hawaii samarthan or avarodhan kshamta ke saath hawa main shreshthata vaale ladaku vimaan kii bhartiya vaayu sena kii aavashyaktaa adhuri hi rah gai
 In 1983 DRDO received permission to undertake a program for the design and development of a light fighter aircraft and thus only this time a different management approach was adopted
 1984 main, elsie kaarykram prabandhan ke liye aironotical deveopment agency sthapit kii gai
 Ada is an effective "national association", with Hieli being a key partner
 hieli praathmik thekedaar ke rup main kaary karata he or uski elsie kii sanrachana, pranali ekikaran, airfrem vinirmaan, vimaan ko antim rup se taiyaar kar, udaan pareekshan, seva se sambandhit samarthan kaa agrani daayitv he

 Gas Turbine Research Establishment has the responsibility for the structure and parallel development of the GTX 35VS Kaveri after burning turbofan engine for Tejas, which will use General Electric F404 turbofan as an interim power plant until Kaveri becomes available
 elsie ke liye bhartiya vaayu sena ke hawaii karmchaariyon kii oktober 1985 tak puri nahin ho pai thi
 This delay led to the dismantling of the original program and the first flight took place in April 1990 and was taken into service in April 1995, however, this delay could prove to be a boon, as it would have made Ada a national R&D and industrial resource, The recruitment personnel got time to sort out the tasks like creating the infrastructure and to get a clear vision, so that the advanced technologies country Switch to the further development and does not need to be imported
 pariyojna paribhaasha oktober 1987 main shuru hui or 1988 ke sitambar main ise puraa kiya gaya
 Dassault Aviation of France was appointed as an advisor to review the PD and provide advice based on its extensive aviation expertise
 vimaan kii sanrachana or vikaas kii prakriya main PD charan ek praarambhik mahatvapurn tatv he, kyonki isse vistrut sanrachana, vinirmaan drushtikon or rakrakhaav sambandhi aavashyaktaaon ke pramukh tatwon ke parinaam nikle
 iske alaava, isi bindu par samgr kaarykram laagat ko sabase prabhavi dhang se niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 The cost of implementing changes in structure requirements, capabilities and facilities increases rapidly and the graph of development tends to fall down compared to the time of commencement and is likely to cost more time and cost to complete the program
 elsie sanrachana ko 1990 main antim rup diya gaya or "relax static stability" ke saath yah ek chote delta pankh vaali mashin ke rup main tha, jisase ki yuddh kaushal main bhoomika badhaai ja sake
 lagbhag turant baad hi uddyan ke electranik upkarnon or unnat samgr dhaanche jaise kuch nirdisht kaarnon se thodi chintaa hui or bhartiya vaayu sena ko andeh hua ki ek aisi mahatvakankshi pariyojna ke samarthan ke liye bharat ke paas paryaapt buniyadi dhaancha he bhi yaa nahin
 may 1989 main ek sarkari samiksha samiti kaa gathan kiya gaya, jisane ek aam raay yah di ki bharat ke paas pariyojna shuru karne ke liye buniyadi dhaanche, suvidhaon or praudyogiki ke adhiktar kshetron main adhik paryaaptta he
 However, as a step of foresight it was decided that the level of development of full-scale engineering of the program would have to proceed in two stages
 charan-ek "avadharana ke saboot" par dhyaan kendrit karegaa or isamen do praudyogiki pradarshak vimaanon kii sanrachana, vikaas or pareekshan or ek sanrachanaatmak namoona pareekshan airfrem kaa gathan shaamil honge or TD vimaan ke safal pareekshan ke baad hi bharat sarkaar elsie sanrachana ko apana puraa samarthan degi
 iske baad do prototip vaahanon kaa nirmaan or vimaan ke liye aavashyak buniyadi dhaanche or pareekshan suvidhaon kaa nirmaan shuru hoga
 duusare charan main teen or prototip vaahanon kaa nirmaan, ek kathin pareekshan namoona or vibhinn kendron par vikaas va pareekshan kii suvidhaayen behaal karnaa shaamil hoga
 Phase-1 began in 1990 and Hieli began work on technology demonstrations in mid-1991, however, due to the financial crisis, full-scale funding was not authorized until April 1993, resulting in Phase 1 work of FSED Started in June
 pehla praudyogiki pradarshak, TD-1, 17 navambar 1995 ko puraa hua or uske baad 17 navambar 1998 main TD-2 puraa hua, lekin kai sanrachanaatmak chintaaon or udaan niyantran pranali ke vikaas main pareshaani ke kaaran inhen kai saal tak jameen par hi rakhaa gaya
 One of the most ambitious requirements for the LCA was the specification "relax Static Stability"
 Although Dassault proposed an analog FCS system in 1988, Ada believed that digital flight control technology would soon replace it
 General Dynamics debuted on the YF-16, which was the first aircraft in the world to be called slightly unstable from an aerodynamic point of view
 adhiktar vimaanon kii sanrachana sthitik sthirataa ke liye "sakaaratmak" thi, jiskaa matlab he ki niyantran jaankaree ke abhaav main unamem ek str par lautne kii prakritikpravriti va niyantrit udaan hoti he
 But this quality is contrary to the skilled efforts of the pilot
 duusari taraf "nakaaratmak" sthitik sthirataa kii suvidha vaala vimaan apane str va niyantrit udaan se alag hat saktaa he, jab tak payalat lagaataar ise santulit karne kaa prayaas nahin karata, haalanki yah gatishiltaa ko badhaata he, par yah bahut kuch payalat par he ki vah ek yantric udaan niyantran pranali par kitna bharosa karata he
 The development of the FBW flight control system demands extensive knowledge of flight control laws and expensive writing on software codes for flight control computers, as well as knowledge of the need for its integration with flight electronic systems and other electronic systems
 jab elsie kaarykram shuru kiya gaya tha, FBW ek atyaadhunik praudyogiki thi or yah itani samvedansheel thi ki bharat ko koi desh nahin mila, jo ise niryaat karne ke liye taiyaar ho
 isliye, bharat kaa apana sanskaran viksit karne ke liye neshnal aironautics prayogshaala ne 1992 main elsie rashtriya niyantran kanoon team kaa gathan kiya gaya
 Scientists and mathematicians in the CLAW team succeeded in developing their control laws, but could not test them, as India did not have advanced "real time ground stimulators" at the time
 tadnusaar, 1993 main british airospes or lochid martin ko madad ke liye bulaayaa gaya, par vaimaaniki vikaas pratishthan ke liye niyantran kanoonon ko FCS software main code karne kaa prayaas pehle kii gai ummid se zyada bada kaam sabit hua
 Problems with specific control laws were investigated in BAE simulators
 haalanki yah viksit karne kii prakriya main tha, isaki koding ke pragatisheel tatwon ko kramash:ade or hieli main "minibard" or "aayranbird" test ring jaanch kii gai
 The second series of simulations were tested during flight on the F-16 VISTA of the integrated flight control software
 july, 1996 main simmulator, 33 pareekshan udaanen bhari gayi
 haalanki, lochid martin kii bhagidaari 1998 main khatm ho gai, kyonki us saal may main bharat ke duusare ke parmaanu pareekshanon ke jawaab main america ne pratibandh laga diya tha
 The CLAW team at NAL was able to successfully complete the integration of flight control laws indigenously, and FCS Software completed a 50-hour pilot test on the TD-1 without interruption, resulting in early 2001 The aircraft was approved for flight
 janvari 2001 ko elsie kii pehali udaan TD dwaara bengalore ke paas banaaye gayi rashtriya udaan pareekshan centre se hui
 iske baad 1 agast 2003 ko isaki pehali safal supersonic udaan hui
 sitambar 2001 main TD-2 ko apni pehali udaan bharne kaa samay mila, 6 june 2002 tak ise yah mauka nahin mil sakaa
 tejas ] Ada's team chose another indigenous technology sector to be indigenously developed, Tejas' multi-dimensional radar
 prarambh main isaki yojana elsie ke liye arikson microwave system PS-05 / AI / J-band multi function radar ke prayog kii thi jise arikson or pherenti raksha pranali ekikaran dwaara saab JAS-39 gripen ke liye viksit kiya gaya tha
 However, after examining other radars in the 1990s, the DRDO became confident that its indigenous development was possible
 hieli ke hyderabad divijan or LRDE ko sanyukt rup se MMR kaarykram ke netritv ke liye chunaa gaya
 Although it is not clear exactly when the structure work will start, the radar development effort started in 1997
 DRDO kaa centre for airborne studies MMR ke liye pareekshan kaarykram chalaane ke liye jimmedaar he
 Between 1996 and 1997, CABS converted the existing Hieli / HS-748M aerial surveillance post testbed into lca's electronic flight system and radar test bed, dubbed the 'hack' and the only major structural change other than the rotodome assembly Also known as LCA, the nose cone of the LCA was prosecuted according to the MMR
 2002 ke tak MMR ke vikaas main deree or laagat main vruddhi kaa anubhav hona bataaya gaya
 In early 2005, testing was confirmed only for air-to-air 'look up' and 'look down' modes - two very basic modes
 may 2006 main yah khulaasa kiya gaya ki pareekshan vaali kai vidhiyon kaa pradarshan abhi bhi "apekshaaon se kam" he
 As a result, Ada reduced weapons tests during flight with a weapon dropping pod, which is not a primary sensor, postponing several critical tests
 pareekshan report ke anusaar, samasya kii jad radar or LRDE dwaara banaaye gayi unnat signal procesar modul ke bich anukulata gambhir mudda he
 Interim options for acquiring Alta's EL / M-2052 such as 'off the Self' foreign radar are being seriously considered
 prarambh main, prototip vimaan ko general electric F404- GE-F2J3 afterburning terbophan ingine se las karne kaa nirnay liya gaya tha
 Simultaneously, in 1986, a parallel program was launched for the development of an indigenous power plant
 gas terbine anusandhan praadhikaran ke netritv main GTRE GTX-35VS, jiskaa naam "kaveri" rakhaa gaya, ke bare main yah ummid kii gai ki vah puri tarah utpaadit vimaan F404 kii jagah legaa
 However, the progress of the Cauvery development program slowed down due to technical difficulties
 2004 ke madhya main, kaveri rus main oonchai pareekshan main asafal ho gai or ise tejas vimaan ke pehle utpaadan ke rup main pesh karne kii antim ummid samaapt ho gai
 The companies were invited by issuing a tender for further development of Kaveri
 farvari 2006 main kida ne kaveri kii samasyaon ko dur karne ke kaam main takneekee sahaayta ke liye francisi vimaan kaa ingine company snisma se anubandh kiya
 At that time, DRDO hoped to have the Kaveri engine ready for use in Tejas by 2009-10
 kaveri ke vikaas main paidaa ho rahi khaamiyon ko dekhte hue 2003 main ucch gunvattta vaale general electric F404, F404-GE-IN20 injanon ko aath purv utpaadit LSP vimaanon or do nausena prototip ke liye kharidne kaa nirnay kiya gaya
 Ada awarded a US $ 105 million contract to an American General Electric in February 2004 to develop and produce 17-IN20 locomotives, which began supply in 2006
 farvari 2007 main, hieli ne ek atirikt F404- GE-IN20 afterburning terbophan ingine kaa aadesh diya, jisase bhartiya vaayu sena ke liye tejas ladaaku vimaan ke pehle parichaalan squadran ko takat di ja sake
 Prior to the timely order, the F404-GE-IN20 was put on trial as a light combat aircraft and was part of the final evaluation of the test flight until mid-2007
 F404-GE-IN20 ingine ne sthapit kiye jane se pehle 19,000 pound sthapit kiye bina thrust arjeet kiya, 330 ghante kaa twarit mishan pareekshan puraa kiya, jo 1000 ghante kii udaan ke baraabar tha
 The IN20 replaced the F2J3 development engines, which carried 600 flights and used eight engines
 sitambar 2008 main, yah ghoshnaa kii gai ki kaveri tejas ke liye samay par taiyaar nahin ho sakegaa or ek aisa bijli sanyantr chunanaa hoga, jo utpaadan prakriya main ho
 kida ke liye 95 se 100 kiloneuton range vaale adhik shaktishaalee ingine ke liye anurodh prastaav jari karne kii yojana he
 Its potential contenders could be Eurojet EJ200 and General Electric F414
 eurojet EJ200 ke pranodan peshkash ko kaaphi joardaar mana gaya he
 The single crystal turbine blade technology, which was originally refused to Indian scientists, was also offered by Eurojet to India through the EJ200 engine
 may 2009 main yah ghoshnaa kii gai ki vimaan ke liye adhik shaktishaalee ingine hasil karne ke liye 3,300 karod rupye kii ek vaishvik nivida jari kii jaayegi, kyonki maujuuda general electric F404 ingine itnaa takat nahin paidaa karte ki kam se kam hathiyaaron ke bhaar ke saath vimaan hamale karne main sakasham ho
 Eurojet Turbo and American company General Electric will compete to supply 100 engines for LCA
 eurojet EJ200 or GE epa-414 ingine bhartiya vayusena kii aavashyaktaaon ko puraa karenge kyonki ve 95-100 kiloneuton takat utpann karte hai
 Indian Air Force sources also said that the structure of the airframe would be designed in such a way that heavy engines could be installed, which is expected to take three to four years
 haalanki tejas vimaanon ke shuruuaati batch kam shakti vaale general electric F404 injanon dwaara sanchalit honge, jo 80-85 kiloneuton kii takat utpann karte hai
 In December 1996, the then scientific advisor APJ Abdul Kalam calculated and calculated its unit cost at US $ 2
1 million
 2001 ke ant main kida or elsie kaaryakramon ke nideshak dow kota harinarayan ne elsie kii ikai laagat 17 se 20 lakh america dollar aanki or bataaya ki ek baar utpaadan shuru ho gaya to isaki keemat 15 karod america dollar tak ho sakati he
 However, by 2001 others indicated that LCA would cost US $ 24 million
 vartmaan daron par isaki prati vimaan keemat abhi bhi 21
27 million america dollar he
 Considering the increase in cost, some aviation experts believe that when the aircraft comes out, it can cost US $ 350 million per aircraft
 20 tejas vimaanon ke liye 2,000 karod rupee ke aadesh se ek unit kii kharid keemat prayek ke liye 22
6 million america dollar hogi, jo abdul kalam ke anumaanon ke anuroop hogi
 Tejas will be cheaper than other 4
5 generation fighter aircraft due to a price rate of around US $ 20 to 30 million
 times of india ke 3 farvari 2010 kii report ke mutabik bharat sarkaar elsie pariyojna ko jivit rakhane ke liye or 8000 karod rupye degi
 The Indian Navy has cleared the order for six naval LCA
 jis par prati vimaan anumaanit laagat 31
09 karod america dollar aayegi
 The delay in development of LCA was mainly attributed to India's lack of experience in designing sophisticated fighter aircraft structure
 bharat ne pehle 1950 ke dashak ke aakhir main keval duusari peedi ke ladaaku vimaan kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 The leap from the second generation to the 4
5 generation could have been a hindrance
 bharat ke vivaadaaspad parmaanu pareekshanon par america pratibandh or bhartiya vaayu sena kii badalati jaruraton ne elsie pariyojna main madad nahin kii
 In an interview on May 1, 2006, Hiali Chairman Ashok Baweja said that the fifth prototype vehicles, trainer prototypes and eight LSP aircraft would be supplied before the end of 2006
 ye vimaan elsie ke liye praarambhik parichaalan manjuuri main teji laane kaa kaam karenge
 It is expected that it will join the Indian Air Force by the end of 2006, as the phase of the structure and development of the LCA system is finally being completed in 2010
 ek prashikshak sanskaran kaa bhi vikaas kiya ja rahaa he or nausena sanskaran kii sanrachana puri ho gai he or iske 2008 main udaan bharne kii ummid he
 The LSP-1 made its first flight only in April 2007, while the trainer prototype is not yet supplied
 bhartiya vayusena ke 20 vimaanon ke aadesh ko 2012 ke baad parichaalan manjuuri paane kii ummid hai
 Tejas is currently undergoing flight tests
 ek baar praarambhik aaparating manjuuri milane ke baad ise simit sankhya main bhartiya vaayu sena main shaamil kiya jayega
 antim aaparating manjuuri hasil hone ke baad ise purna paimaane par shaamil kiya jaayegaa
 IOC kaa pareekshan 2009 tak or 2010 tak FOC kaa pareekshan puraa hone kii ummid he
 Independent analysts and officials are hopeful that operational supplies of fighter aircraft Tejas in the Indian Air Force will start around 2010 and will be in service by 2010
 bhartiya vaayu sena ne 14 sadasyeey 'elsie induction team banaai he, jisamen bhartiya vaayu sena ke payalat va adhikari shaamil hai or iskaa netritv air vaais marshall bi

 The objectives of this team include overseeing the process of joining the LCA, diagnosing any challenges that may arise and helping to optimize the development process of Tejas' operational use, and with it the creation of principles, training programs, maintenance programs , So that the Indian Air Force can rapidly prepare for the operational service of Tejas
 isse bhartiya vaayu sena kii is ichha kaa khulaasa hota he ki vah elsie ke vikaas main or adhik shaamil hone or saath hi saath naye vimaan ko shaamil karne jaldi main he
 This team is stationed in Bangalore
 hieli ke varisht adhikariyon ne march 2005 main kaha tha ki bhartiya vaayu sena 20 tejas vimaanon ke liye 2,000 karod rupee ke aadesh nirgat karegaa or iske baad or 20 vimaanon kii kharid hogi
 All 40 will be equipped with F404-GE-IN 20 engines
 So far, 4806
312 crore has been spent on the development of various versions of light combat aircraft
 tejas naam ke swadeshi halke ladaaku vimaan pehle squadran ko dakshin bhartiya rajya tamilnadu main tainaat kiya jayega, jab 20 ladaaku vimaanon ke pehle batch ko 2009-2010 main bhartiya vaayu sena main shaamil hone kii ummid hai
 a successful test of light combat aircraft was conducted on 30 May 2008 in hot weather
 'elsie' tejas ke utpaadan sanskaran kii udaan 16 june 2008 ko hui
 In December 2008, Hieli Tejas was successfully tested at a high altitude in Leh
 elsie tejas ne 22 janvari 2009 ko 1000 pareekshan udaan puri kii
 Tejas has completed a 530-hour flight test
 farvari 2009 tak vaimaaniki vikaas agency ke adhikariyon ne kaha ki tejas ne hathiyaaron ke saath udaan shuru kar di he or radar kaa ekikaran march 2009 tak puraa ho jayega
 lagbhag sabhi pranali vikaas gatividhiyaan us samay tak puri ho jaaengi
 The Indian Navy has placed an order for six Navy LCA

 In December 2009, the Government of India approved Rs 8,000 crore to start production of fighter jets for the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy
 24 farvari 2010 ko bharat sarkaar dwaara haal hi main jari ek press vijyapti main bataaya gaya ki elsie tejas march 2011 tak bhartiya vaayu sena main shaamil hoga
 In addition to the above contract of 20 LCA, the proposal for purchase of additional 20 LCA final operational clearance configuration is in progress
 elsie ke vinirdesh bhartiya vaayu sena dwaara taiyaar vaayu seva jaruraton ke anusaar hai
 Tejas Mark-2 is also likely to be developed due to the inability of Mark-1 to meet the requirements of the Indian Air Force staff
 bhartiya vaayu sena 2005 main jari kiye ja chuke 40 vimaanon ke aadesh ke alaava kisi bhi mark-1 vimaanon kaa aadesh nahin degi
 jab phir se sanrachana kiye gayi mark-2 viksit honge to 125 vimaanon tak ke ek aadesh par vichaar kiya ja rahaa he
 According to a spokesperson of the Indian Air Force, the Mark-2 will have more powerful engines, sophisticated aerodynamics and other upgrades to reduce the number of obsolescent devices
 bhartiya nausena ke mark-2 tejas sanskaran ek vimaan vaahak pot se bahut kam samay main udaan bharne or utarane main sakasham honge
 The naval version of the Tejas is expected to be ready soon
 nausena pramukh admiral nirmal verma ne nausena ke apane pehle saptaahik samvaadadaata sammelan main kaha ki 2009 disambar tak DRDO ne aashwaasan diya he ki elsie kaa nausena sanskaran 2013 tak vaahak pareekshan ke liye taiyaar ho jayega or gorshkove / vikramaditya or saath hi bhartiya vimanavahak poton par tainaati ho sakegi
 He said the Navy was conducting a 'conceptual study' for more capable carrier aircraft for the IAC-2
 "nausainik ke elsie sanskaran" kii visheshtaon main se kuch : The Tejas is a jet fighter aircraft with a single engine and various roles, featuring tailless and compound delta wing platforms and with a "relaxed statics stability" structure, which helps increase aircraft maneuvers
 mul rup se isaki seva jamini hamale kii bhoomika ke saath madhyastareey "mook bam" ke rup main hawa main shreshthata sabit karne vaale vimaan ke rup main lene kaa makasad rakhaa gaya, par sanrachana sambandhi najariye main lacheelepan kii vajah se yah hawa se sataha or nauvahan-virdohi hathiyaar ke rup ekikrut ho saktaa he, jisase yah kai tarah kah bhoomika or kai tarah ke mishan puraa karne kii kshamta hasil kar saktaa he
 The structure of the tailless and compound delta planforms is to keep tejas short and light
 is planfarm kaa upyog niyantran sataha jaruraton ko kam se kam rakhata he, vyapak shrenee ke bahari store ke vahan kii ijaajat detaa he or crucifarm sanrachana kii tulana main behatar kareebi muqabla karne, ucch gati or ucch alpha bhoomikaaon kii visheshta vaala hota he
 Wing tunnel test models and complex computational fluid dynamics analysis on a large-scale scale model have minimized the aerodynamic configuration of LCA, allowing it to achieve minimal supersonic drag, low wing loading, and high rates of roll and pitch
 sabhi hathiyaaron ko prayek shakha main ek yaa ek se adhik 4,000 kilo kii kul kshamta ke saath saat hardpaints ke saath dhoya jaataa he : har wing ke tahat teen stesan or ek fuzleg centerline par hota he
 There is also an eighth portside intake trunk under offset station, which can carry a variety of pods and under-fuseleg stations to centerline stations and inboard pairs of wing stations
 tejas main abhinn aantarik eendhan tanks hota he, jo fuzleg or wing main 3,000 kilo eendhan rakh saktaa he or aage fuzleg starboard kii ore ek nishchit infite eendhan bharne vaala phixd upkaran hota he
 Externally inboard and midboard wing stations and centerline fuseleg stations have "weight" hardpoint provisions of up to three 1,200 or five 800-liter fuel tanks
 elsie aluminium-lithium mishra dhaatu, carbon fibre compojit or titanium mishra dhaatu-stells se bana he
 C-FC supplies up to 45% of its airframe as Tejas weight, including a fuselage wing, XI tailfin, rudder, air brakes and landing gear doors
 sabhi dhaatu sanrachana kii tulana main sammishran vaale dhaatuon kaa upyog vimaan ko halkaa or majboot donon banaata he or elsie c-fcs kaa niyojan pratishat apni shrenee ke samakaleen vimaanon main ek sarvocch he
 In addition to making the aircraft very light, there are minimal joints or spikes, which increases the reliability of the aircraft and reduces the possibility of cracks resulting from structural weakness
 elsie ke liye telphin ek akhand madhukosh ke tukade jaisaa he, jo "sabatractive" yaa "didctive" pranali kii tulana main utpaadan laagat ko 80% tak kam kar sakati he
jiskaa shaft ek computarikrut ank niyantrit mashin dwaara titanium mishra dhaatu ke ek block se nikaala jaataa he
 No other manufacturer has succeeded in making the outer wing out of a single piece of metal
 radar ke liye'ek naak' keel ghumaakar jodi jaati he
 The use of alloys in the LCA reduced the total number of devices by 40% compared to the use of metal frames
 In addition, the number of accelerating devices decreased by half from 10,000 in alloy structures whose metal The frame structure was required
 samgr sanrachana se ek or madad mili ki airfrem main 2,000 chhed nahin karne pade
 kul milakar, is vimaan vajan 21% se kam he
 One of these factors can be reduced production costs, an additional benefit - and significant cost savings - realized in the expected time to assemble the small aircraft - seven months for the LCA as against 11 months of an all-metal airframe
 Use tejas ke nausainik sanskaran ke airfrem main naak ke jhukaav ke sambandh main sanshodhan kiya jaayegaa taaki vimaan utaarne ke samay drishy ko or behatar kiya ja sake auraudane ke dauraan gati or badhaane ke liye or wing leading age vortex controlrs kaa upyog kiya jaayegaa
 LEVCON niyantran satahon par kaam karte hai jo wing root leading age se vistaarit hote hai or is tarah elsie ko dhimi gati ke dauraan behatar tareeke se sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he nahin to khinchaav badhane ke kaaran theda baadhit hota he, jaisaa ki delta wing sanrachana main hota he
 An additional benefit is that LEVCON also increases the ability to control at high angles of attack
 nausainik tejas kii ridh vaala hissaa bhi majboot, ek lanbaa or majboot pahiyevaala or deck par gatishiltaa ke liye noj hvil stearing hota he

 Its first feature is that it has a particularly high number of speakers compared to other dialects
 duusari yah ki is parivaar main keval dogri hi saahitiyik rup se gatisheel or sampann he
 The third peculiarity of Dogri is also that at one time this language has been the medium of internal behavior of state administration in the princely state of Kashmir and Chamba state

 Due to this tendency, there is also the additional arrival of Su in many forms, such as- sankshepikaran- jaise See detailed article under Dogri literature

 It is one of the three texts that make the Tripitaka
 is granth main vishleshanyukt deshna or dharmik vyakhya sangrahit he
 The tradition states that the Buddha thought Abhidhamma soon after his enlightenment, then taught the gods a few years later
 baad main buddha ne ise sariputta ko doharaaya, jisane ise apane shishyon ko saunp diya
 This tradition is also evident in the Parivar, very late Vinay Pitaka, who mentions in a concluding poem praising the Buddha that this best-known creature, the lion, taught the three Pitakas
 haalanki, vidwaan aamtaur par buddha kii mrityu ke baad 100 se 200 saal baad teesri shatabdi isa purv ke aasapaas kuch samay paidaa karne ke liye abhimamma kaary karte hai
 Therefore, the seven Abhidhamma works are generally claimed by scholars not to represent the words of the Buddha, but to those of the disciples and scholars
 rupert gethin ne haalanki kaha ki abhimmaa paddati ke mahatvapurn tatv shaayad buddha ke jeevankaal main waapas aa jaaenge
 Both AK Warder and Peter Harvey suggested early dates for Matka on which the Abibimma books are based

 iske alaava, abhimmaa kaa paali sanskaran sakhti se therawada sangrah he, or anya buddha vidyalayon dwaara manyata praapt abhimamma kaaryon ke saath bahut kam he
 There is no agreement on the doctrine on the various Abhidhamma philosophies of different elementary schools and belongs to the period of 'divided Buddhism'
 paali canan ke shuruaati granthon main abhimamma pitak ke granthon kaa koi ullekh nahin he
 Abhidhamma is also not mentioned in some reports of the first Buddhist Council, which refer to the texts of Vinaya and the existence of five nikais or four agamas, although it may be noted that the abhinhamma before being in the venerable first council
 The first was passed to the Buddha
 anya khaaton main abhimamma shaamil he
 In the Theravadadi Abhidhamma Pitaka, unlike the Abhidhyata Pitta of the Sarvastivaya School, formal theorization is absent, and the question of the formal status of religions remains an important issue

 In ancient India, the constellations were called constellations
 aadhunik kaal ke khagolashastra main taramandal unhi taron ke samoohon ko kaha jaataa he jin samoohon par antarrashtriya str par antarrashtriya khagoleey sangh main sahmati ho
 In the modern era, the area around a star constellation is also given the name of the same constellation

 If you want to tell where an astronomical object will be found in the sky at night, it is told in which planetarium it is located
 dhyaan rahen ki kisi taramandal main dikhne vaale taare or anya vastuen prithvi se dekhne par bhale hi ek-duusare ke sameep lagen lekin zaruri nahin he ki aisa vastav main bhi ho
 The way the two mountains can look close to each other when seen far away, but on approaching it shows that there is a lot of distance between them and one mountain is actually miles behind the other mountain
 "taramandal" ko sanskrit main "nakshatra" kehete the or vibhinn bhartiya bhashaaon main iske liye aaj bhi yah shabd prayog hota he
 The planetarium is called "constellation" in English and "majmua-al-najoom" in Arabic
 taramandal main vah taare or khagoleey vasteen hoti hai jo prithvi kii sataha se dekhne par sthai rup se akaash main ek hi kshetra main ikaithi nazar aati hai
 This does not mean that they are actually close to each other or that they have any significant gravitational bond

 But the hypothesis about the 24th incarnation of Mahavishnu and the tenth in major incarnations and the last Kalki avatar for the future i
e
 tomorrow to come is as follows- Name form - 'kalki Purana' Various religious of Hindus And is one of the mythological texts
 vishnu ke anya avtaron kii tarah kalki kaa varnan bhi vedon main nahin miltaa

 jab kalki puraana likhaa gaya hoga tab rajtantr vyavastha thi isliye bhavishya ke kalki kii katha purnataya usee style main hi he jis style main anya avtaron kii katha he
 The feeling of Vishwamana's share can be expressed by any person whose projection or presentation is only through the person's own culture at that time
 phir bhi kalki katha ke bhi kuch na kuch arth to avashya he
 Careful- kalki avatar ke kaliyug main hindustan ke sambhal main hone par sabhi hindu sahamat hai parantu sambhal kahan he isamen anek matbhed hai

 kuch sambhal ko china ke gobhi marusthal main maanate hai jahaan manushya pahunch hi nahin saktaa
 Some believe in Vrindavan
 kuch sambhal ko muradabad jile main maanate hai jahaan kalki avatar mandir bhi he
 The subject to consider is that "sambhal will have Kalki avatar or where Kalki avatar will be the same
" “ sambhal kaa shabdic arth samaan rup se bhala yaa shaanti karnaa yaa shaanti hona arthath jahaan shaanti va aman ho yaa shaanti failaane vaala ho, hota he
 In the Kalki Purana, 68 pilgrimage sites are mentioned in Sambhal
 kaliyug main keval sambhal hi ek maatr aisa tirth sthaan hoga jo kalyaan daayak or shaanti pradaan karne vaala hoga
 The meaning of the pilgrimage is in the meaning of holy place, darshan, heart, mind, heart, ghat, pond, place of water, immortal living water, place of people coming and gathering place
 brahman pita vishnuyash or mata sumati- kalki puraana ke anusaar kalki avatar ke pita va mata kaa naam vishnuyash va sumati hoga, jo naam nahin balki gunon ko nirdeshit karata he
 a Brahmin means one who knows the Vedas, the Puranas and the pure Supreme consciousness
 vishnu arthath parameshwar, sarvavyaapak ish jo sab sthanon main upasthit he, brahmand ko paidaa karne vaala sristaa
 Yash means praise or praise
 is prakaar pita vishnuyash kaa arth hua, aisa pita jo sarvavyaapak paramatma kii stuti evam prashansa karne vaala va sabakaa bhala karne vaala hitaishi he
 Similarly, Sumati means to have a beautiful or good opinion or idea
 kalki avatar kii patni - kalki puraana main It is said about the "kalki" incarnation that- "he will be married to Padmadevi, the daughter of Brihadratha
" “ parantu katra-jammu main vaishno devi kii katha ke sambandh main bikne vaali pustika, internet par uplabdh katha or gulshan kumaar krit ”maan vaishno devi“ pradarshit film par aadhaarit katha ke anusaar ”trikuta ne shriram se kaha- usne unhen pati rup main sweekaar kiya he
 Shriram tells him that he has pledged to be loyal to Sita only in this incarnation but Lord Shriram assured him that in Kali Yuga he would appear as Kalki and marry her
 “ a description of a goddess is found in Kriskindhand of Sriramcharitmanas
 inhone hanumanji tathaa anya banar biron ko jal va fal diya tha tathaa unhen gupha se nikaalkar sagar ke tat par pahunchaaya tha
 These Goddesses are Swayamprabha
 yahi devi mata vaishnav ke rup main pratishthit hai
 Kalki will be the incarnation of God in the last phase of Kali Yuga
 tab ye kalki bhagwaan dushton ko dandit karenge or dharti par dharm kii sthapana karenge
 And Devi Swayamprabha will marry as promised in Sri Ramavatar
 arthath vaishno devi jo yugon se pind rup main hai unhen kalki avatar ek saakaar rup pradaan karenge jo ”maan vaishno devi“ ke saakaar rup ”maan kalki devi“ hogin
 Body shape - maharishi vyas rachit or ishwar ke aathven avatar shri krishna ke mukh se vyakt shrimadbhagavadgita main bhi avatar ke hone kaa pramaan miltaa he
 From time to time, we have religious faith in India
 abhiyutthanam dharmasy tadatmanan srujamyaham
 
 arthath he bharat! jis kaal main dharm kii haani hoti he or adharm kii adhikta hoti he
 It is in that period that i reveal my soul
 is prakaar kalki avatar kaa sharir maanav kaa hi hoga jisase aatma kaa rup prakat hoga or krishna rup hoga
 Karma Roop - Kalki Mahavatar will destroy all evil by riding a white horse with a sword in his hand
 kisi bhi dharm shastron main vichaaron ke nirupan ke liye pratikon kaa prayog kiya jaataa rahaa he kyonki vichaar kii koi akruti nahin hoti
 Thus, on clarifying the meaning of Kalki avatar, we find that the white horse means the symbol of peace or the non-violent path, the sword means knowledge, the universal truth-principle which will lead to mental slaughter of all
 agar ham in pratikon ko usee rup main len to kya aaj ke ek se ek vigyaan aadhaarit shastr arthath aujaar ke yug main talwaar se kitne logon kaa vadh sambhav he or vah vyakti kitna shaareerik shakti se yukt hoga, yah vichaarneey vishay he? The result is only one mental slaughter which is possible only by universal truth-theory
 or pichley avtaron dwaara shaareerik va aarthik kaarnon kaa prayog kar dharm sthapana ho chukaa he
 Kalki Purana Katha creators would not have even imagined that in the future a new system based on visual matter science based visual time and formless constitution will also come and at that time there will be no king and monarchy, then whom will Kalki Avatar kill? Dvya or world form - according to the qualities of Kalki incarnation, the true form of doing karma is shown with one step and with many hands symbolizing many karma
 isse yah spasht hota he ki kalki avatar dwaara ek karm sampann hoga or uske kaaran anek haathon se karm hone lagegein arthath ve yah kehane main sakasham hogen ki ”main anek haathon se karm kar rahaa hoon or sabhi mere hi karmgyaan se karm ko kar rahen hai
 " saarvbhaum satya gyaan ke shaastra ”gita“ ke baad saarvbhaum karmgyaan kii aavashyaktaa he jo kalki avatar ke kaaryo kaa hi ek charan he
 Knowledge Form - Knowledge of the last universal truth-principle will be the knowledge form of the last incarnation, which will have the following reasons
 1
 prakruti ke teen gun- satv, raj, tam se mukt hokar ishwar se saakshaatkaar karne ke ”gyaan“ kaa shaastra ”shrimadbhagavadgita yaa gita yaa gitopanishad“ uplbdh ho chukaa tha parantu saakshaatkaar ke uparant karm karne ke gyaan arthath ishwar ke mastishk kaa ”karmgyaan“ kaa shaastra uplabdh nahin hua tha arthath ishwar ke saakshaatkaar kaa shaastra to uplabdh tha parantu ishwar ke karm karne kii vidhi kaa shaastra uplabdh nahin tha
 Man needs his brain more than God
 2
 prakruti kii vyakhya kaa gyaan kaa shaastra ”shrimadbhagavadgita yaa gita yaa gitopanishad“ to uplabdh tha parantu brahmand kii vyakhya kaa tantra shaastra uplabdh nahin tha
 3
 Individual religion was available in the society, but macroeconomic science was not available so that humans can live in their own religions and respect other religion, also understand national religion and know their duty towards it
 4
 shaastra-sahitya se bhare is sansar main koi bhi ek aisa maanak shaastra uplabdh nahin tha jisase purna gyaan kii uplabdhi ho sake saath hi maanav or uske shashan pranali ke satyikaran ke liye anant kaal tak ke liye maargdarshan praapt ho sake
 5
 Many different types of scriptures were available to understand God, but the scripture to understand the avatar was not available
 kalki avatar ke guru – According to the Kalki Purana, "lord Parashurama will be the guru of Kalki, the tenth incarnation of Lord Vishnu and teach him war
 ve hi kalki ko bhagwaan shiv kii tapasya karke divya shastr praapt karne ke liye kahenge
 "states had been established by many Asuri kings until the sixth incarnation in the truth-based Satyuga with personal unseen natural consciousness in the personal attest of the invisible period - Parashurama incarnation
 As a result, in such a situation, a man's soul was in circumstances created by the invisible natural consciousness
 Working in the present with priority, was established in and she has done many things Slaughtered the castes and established a new system by co-existence of Asuras and Devas
 jo ek nai or acchhee vyavastha thi
 Therefore, that man was later known as Parashurama incarnation in his name and the system was known as "parashurama tradition", which was the birth of the realization "loktantra", the same based democracy system was spread by Shriram and failed
 In the Dwapar Yuga, after the completion of the Mahabharata war, Lord Krishna had laid the foundation of the formless democratic system, when Lord Mercury Uti found and is currently shapeless constitution based democracy front
 isi vyavastha kii purnataa ke liye kalki avatar honge
 Which can be done only with the understanding of Shiva system, that is, it is the weapon of Shiva and because of understanding democracy, Parashurama will be the guru of Kalki

 Rare and notable exceptions include the effects of Hydra and Jellyfish Turritopsis nutrichula, thought to be both immortal, due to the death of referees / referees / intentional activity as a result of man's war suicide, murder involving approximately 150,000 people for these reasons

 shaareerik maut mrityu ek baar kii sthiti: prakriya ab prativarti main dekha jaataa he
 Where a dividing line in the process of death and life is drawn, the normal clinical death depends on the absence of significant symptoms between death and is not sufficient for a necessary legal determination
 dil or fefdon kii ek marij ke saath kaam karne ke liye ghatanevaala mrityu nirdhaarit kiya ja saktaa he mrit mastishk ke bina kanoonee taur par mrit ghoshit hota he sateek paribhaasha kii maut chikitsa, duusare shabdon main or adhik vidambnaa agrim ke rup main vaigyanik gyaan or dawaai
samasyagrast ho jaati he
 Signs of death or strong signs that a person is still alive: maut kii avadharana kii kunjee ghatana he vahaan kii avadharana ke liye kai vaigyanik tareeke hai
 For example, brain death, in medical practice as science, defines death as a point in time during which brain activity remains
 This is a distinction from a life of defining challenges in a death
 samay main ek bindu ke rup main, mrityu ke kshan, jis par jivan samaapt hota he kaa ullekh karne ke prathit hota he
 However, when determining death has occurred, precise drawing of conceptual boundaries between life and death is required
 is samasyagrast he kyonki vahaan kaise jivan ko paribhaashit karne se adhik chote aam sahmati he
 It is possible to define life in terms of consciousness
 When consciousness ceases, a living organism can be said to have died
 One of the notable flaws in this approach, however, is that there are many organisms that are alive but perhaps not conscious for example, the single-celled organism is another problem with this approach to consciousness, which many different modern scientists, psychologists and philosophers have The definition given by is used in defining
 maut ko paribhaashit karne kii yah aam samasya chikitsa ke sandarbh main paribhaashit kii maut khaas chunauti dene ke liye lagu hota he
 Other definitions for death focus on the character of some disturbance
 In this context, "death" is simply the state where something is left, eg, life describes
 is prakaar, "jivan kii paribhaasha ek saath maut paribhaashit karata he
 Historically, attempts to define the moment of death of a human have been problematic
 or giraftaar ek baar paribhaashit ke rup main band ke dil hriday haraaya he, lekin seepiaar kaa vikaas or sheeghra defibrillation aparyaapt paribhaasha he pradaan kii he ki kyonki shwaas or dil kii dhadkan ko punah aarambh kiya ja saktaa he kabhi kabhi
 jo maut kii ghatnaaye the ab main cousalli jude pichley kisi bhi haalat main sabhi ko maar fefdon ke bina ek kaary hriday yaa, jivan pesamekar sakate hai or es kritrim ang pratyaropan, kabhi kabhi ke saath ek nirantar sangyojan ke jivan kaa samarthan upkarnon main he Today, the definition of a moment of death is necessary, where doctors and coroners usually turn to the clinical dead to define brain "death" or biological "death as a person", when people are considered dead Their brain activity remains electrical
 yah mana jaataa he ki vidyut gatividhi kaa ek ant chetana ant kaa sanket bhi he
 However, the suspension of consciousness should be permanent and not transient, as something happens during sleep stages and especially coma
 In case of gold, Anda can easily tell the difference haalanki, shrenee "mastishk mrityu" kuch vidwaanon dwaara dekha jaataa he ke liye samasyagrast ho
 udhaaharan ke liye, dow franklin miller, bioethics ke vibhaag, swasthya ke rashtriya sansthaanon ke varisht sankaay sadsy, "nots 1990 ke dashak se, tathaapi, maanav teji se kiya ja rahaa tha vidwaanon dwaara chunauti di sakshya par aadhaarit he, kii maut ke saath mastishk mrityu kaa sameekaran jaivik kaamkaaj kii sarani rogiyon dwaara pradarshit ke sambandh main sahi dhang se is shart jo samay kii kaaphi avadhi ke liye yantric ventilation par banaae rakhaa gaya hone ke rup main pahchaan hoti he in rogiyon ko parisancharan or shwasan, niyantran taapmaana, kachare uglana banaae rakhane kii kshamta ko banaae rakhaa, ghaavon ko changa, ladaai sankraman or sabase naatakeey rup se, ke liye fetuces gestate " Those deaths that sustain the cortex-neo are only necessary when sometimes brain consciousness argues that only electrical activity should be defined when considered
 antat yah sambhav he ki maut ke liye kasuti praantastha sangyanatmak sthaayee or aparivartaneey nuksaan kii jaaegi samaaroh, mastishk mrityu ke rup main sabut he vyaktitv soch maanav sabhi aashaa kii vasuuli nikat chaalu he or phir chalaa di chikitsa praudyogi he
 However, at present, the most conservative definition of death in places of electrically invasive termination in whole brain activity as opposed to the cortex-neo is simply adopted 
 Determination of death is for example the Uniform United States Act 2005 In the Terri Schiavo case, the question brought to question the amnesia and artificial brain death of American politics puure dimag maapdand, mastishk mrityu kaa sankalp dwaara bhi jatil ho saktaa he
 The Eagles base could detect simulated impulses, while some drugs, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, or hypothermia can prevent or temporarily suppress brain activity by suppressing the brain's brain
 Because of this, hospital defined conditions include widely varying intervals
 Eigs is the protocol for determining death
 sanyukt rajya america main, ek vyakti kanoonee rup se mar chukaa he agar mrityu praaanpatr yaa ek vaktavy kii maut vyavsaayee chikitsa license praapt he vibhinn kanoonee parinaam maut kaa paalan karen, kanoonee shabdaawalee main jo vyakti se hataane sahit personood kaha jaataa he
 The right to resume brain activity is the ability of brain activity, or, 0} required in the United States

 According to Sugarman, Karson reported that Morrison died of overdose of heroin, which Morrison smelled as cocaine
 Sugarman goes on to say that Karsan made several contradictory statements on Morrison's death, stating that he had either killed Morrison or that he had accidentally caused Morrison's death
 Karson's story of Morrison inadvertently sniffing heroin and taking overdoses was confirmed by Allen Ronai's confession; Ronai wrote that Morrison died of brain haemorrhage after sniffing heroin, and instead of calling for medical help, Morrison lay down, leaving Morrison dying of bleeding
 paris-match main ek lekh main rone ne sweekaar kiya ki morrison kii maut kii paristhitiyon ko chhipaane ke liye tab usne madad kii thi
 In the epilogue of No One Here Gets Out Alive, Hopkins and Sugarman write that Karson lied to police about the death, according to Rhone and Agnes Varada, and later stated in his statement that Morrison never used drugs

 This claim is partially confirmed in The Doors, which stated that Morrison had been vomiting blood in Paris for about two months
 haalanki, da dorce kaa koi bhi sadsy morrison kii mrityu se pehle ke maheenon main uske saath paris main nahin tha
 In the first edition of No One Here Gets Out Alive, published in 1980, Sugarman and Hopkins gave little credence to the rumor that Morrison had not died, calling it a fake death hypothesis, saying "it's not as convoluted as it sounds
" is"
 This fictitious story kept Morrison's loved ones in trouble and sorrow for years, notably when his fans started following Morrison in search of proof of his whereabouts
 a new epilogue was added to Sugerman and Hopkins' book in 1995, which provided new facts about Morrison's death and refuted the fake death hypothesis

 Burnett alleges that the same two drug dealers took Morrison to Ryu Butrelis apartment and dumped him in the bathtub from which he had purchased heroin
 bernet kaa kahana he ki us raat jin logon ne morrison ko dekha tha, unhone mashhoor club ko ghotaale se bachaane ke liye gopneeyata kii shapath lee hui thi or kuch pratyakshdarshiyon ne to turant desh chhod diya

 The method of symmetric components in electrical engineering is used to simplify the analysis of unbalanced three-phase circuits
 Symmetrical components are most commonly used for analysis of three-phase electrical power systems
 If the phase quantities are expressed in phasor notation using complex numbers, a vector can be formed for the three phase quantities
 For example, a vector for three phase voltages could be written as where the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 refer respectively to the zero, positive, and negative sequence components
 The sequence components differ only by their phase angles, which are symmetrical and so are 2 3 π { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle { \ frac {2} {3}} \ pi} radians or 120 °
 Define the operator α { \ displaystyle \ scriptstyle \ alpha} phasor vector forward by that angle
 Note that α3 = 1 so that α−1 = α2
 The components of zero-sequence are mutually in the same art

 Consequently, as the French states, "international law has stressed moral pressure, but some real teeth
" " doosraa, uttar-dakshin sangharsh sahyog ko block kar sakate hai: vaishvik dakshin ke deshon main aam taur par jarurat ke rup main uttar ke deshon ko dekhne paryaavaran ke ksharan ke liye jimmedaari lene or uttari uchit samajhe na to jo jivan ke unke raste main mahatvapurn parivartan karne ke liye
