 thos-avasthaa-electraniki kaa upyog karke vidyut shakti kaa parivartan evam niyantran se sambandhit gyaan ko shakti electronic kehete hai
 There have been revolutionary changes in the field of electrical energy due to power electronics
 aaj 10 wat se lekar kai sau megawatt ke motaron ko chalaane ke liye drive uplabdh hai
 Electric power up to 6 GW can be transmitted via high-voltage DC transmission of about 1000 kw
 railgadiyaan, alevator, or crinen sabhi shakti electronic ke dwaara hi aaraam se chal rahe hai
 Power is the only component in connecting renewable energy sources to the electric grid
 yahan tak ki radar pranali bhi shakti electronic par hi nirbhar he
 Although all small electronic components are used in power electronics, the following components are unique identities of power electronics
 shakti electronic ke kshetra main kaary, laghu-sanket-electraniki ke bhi pehle ho chukaa tha
 Electric machines were first used for the control and conversion of electric power
 iske baad mercury arq ractifire kaa prayog hua
 Then came the era of vacuum and gas-filled valves
 san 1957 main esasiaar ke vikaas se shakti electronic main ek nayi disha mili
 Nowadays, the use of switches like SCR, GTO, BJT, MOSFET, IGBT, etc
 is done very efficiently
 is kaaran shakti electronic kaa kshetra bahut vyapak evam mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Electronics is the department of science in which electric power is efficiently converted to the desired voltage, frequency, current by using electron tubes or semiconductor devices performing similar functions
 vastav main baat yah he ki vidyut shakti hame jis rup main main praapt hoti he usee rup main vah bahut kam upyog main laayi jaati he
 For example, an industry receives electric power in the form of 415 volts, 50 Hz AC
 use vidyutlepan karnaa he jiske liye 0 se 20 volt disi chaiye jisamen se shunya se lekar 1200 ampir dhara bahegi
 It is clear that the power we are getting cannot be directly used for this work, rather it will have to be changed
 yah kaam shakti electraniki dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In fact, there are thousands of examples where electric power cannot be used as it is, rather it has to be changed to some other form
 electraneey yuktiyon main se mahatvapurn upyog ye hai : Many of today's most modern devices also cannot be made without electronics, such as radio, television, movies, fluorescence light, public lecture-system, telephone etc
 ye sab yuktiyaan electraniki kii hi dein hai
 Some of the industrial uses of electronics are briefly mentioned below: udyogon main bahudhaa rujukarak upyog main laae jate hai, jinase prayavarti vidyut-dhara nirdisht dhara main badali jaati he
 They are often of one of the following types: adhik shakti ke rujukari main bahukala rujukari paripathon kaa upyog ekkala rujukari paripathon ke upyog kii upeksha anek kaarnon se adhik laabhadaayak hota he
 The first reason is that nowadays electric power is produced and distributed in the form of tri-art-power
 dwitiya kaaran yah he ki bahukala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata ekkala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata kii apeksha adhik sam hoti he
 In the above mentioned high power loan, either the same loan is kept for many moneylenders or many money bankers, whose loan lines are connected, are used

 The speed of the motor is controlled exclusively in paper mills, because the thickness of the paper depends on the speed itself
 in yantron main exciter ke kshetra kii pravaati dhara main parivartan kiya jaataa he, jo janitr ke liye niyantrak kshetra kaa utpaadan karata he
 This generator is driven by a prime mover
 janitr kaa armechar apana utpaadan us motor ko detaa he jisaki chaal kaa niyantran karnaa hota he
 a sight-current generator is driven by this motor; It produces a voltage proportional to its speed
 yadi vah voltata purvanishchit voltata se bhinn hoti he to ek niamak ko sakriy kar detii he
 This regulator brings about such a change in the area of the exciter that the current of the motor falls to a predetermined value
 is niamak main anek naliyon kaa upyog hota he
 Thus with the help of electronics, the speed of the motor can be controlled to a minimum value

 By this method the work is very clean and an open flame is not present
 dhaatuon ko tapt karne ke kii vidhi ko preran-taapan tathaa achaalak vastuon ko tapt karne kii vidhi ko paravidhyut-taapan kehete hai
 Both of these methods require high frequency alternating current
 tapt kii janevaali dhaatu ke tukade ke chaaron ore ek kundali lapetakar usamen prayavarti dhara kaa pravaah karte hai
 The magnetic current generated by the current flows through the air and also through the metal present near the coil
 dhara ke utkraman se syand main bhi parivartan hota he, jiske kaaran dhaatu main voltata prerit ho jaati he
 Due to this voltage, a large amount of vortex current flows in the metal
 tab dhaatu ke pratirodh ke kaaran taap utpann ho jaataa he
 a power of 1,000 kilocycles or more than 1 meg of cycle is required to electrically conduct dielectric materials
 chunki vastu main hokar dhara pravaahit nahin ho sakati, isliye vastu ko ucch voltatawaale dhaatu ke platon ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 Due to the rapid change of the electric field, the changes in the molecule structure of the dielectric object also begin
 anuon ke bich main gharshan hone ke kaaran vastu main sab ore samaan taap utpann ho jaataa he
 By this method, thick sheets of dielectric objects can be heated in a very short time

 After the mutiny of 1857, when the British were prosecuted against the last emperor of the Mughals, Bahadurshahr Zafar, this newspaper has been repeatedly mentioned in it
 iske chalate hijr sahab ko giraftaar kiya gaya
 He was also prosecuted and sentenced to three years
 unnisvin sati ke antim dashakon se pehle khadi boli ke garh meerut ke prakaashan udyog main hindi kaa prakaashan apekshaakrit kam hota tha
 But it changed in the last decades of the century
 isamen dayanand saraswati ke arya samaaj or meerut ke hi sthaneey nivasee pandit gauridatt sharma kaa baari yogadan tha
 Impressed by the speeches of Swami Dayanand Saraswati, who dedicated himself to the promotion of Devanagari, Pandit Gauridatt Sharma in 1887 brought out a monthly letter 'devanagari Gajat' and in 1892 Devanagari Preacher
 1894 main nagari prachaarini sabha kaa gathan kar masik patr devnagar kaa prakaashan kiya
 All these letters were published in the same raids
 iske alaava pandit ji ne ek upanyaas devraani jethaani kii kahani' bhi likhaa tha
 It was first published in 1870 using the Leitho method at the Jaiyan printing press in Meerut
 isaki prati aaj bhi kalakatta ke neshnal librari main surakshit he
 Acharya Kshemchandra Suman, a famous Hindi writer, has called it the first novel of Hindi
 pandit ji ne apane patron ke jariye devanagari ko badhaava dene ke liye devanagari gajet main bhajan or aarti prakashit kiye
 His hymns were quite popular among women
 pandit ji devanagari ke prachaar ko lekar itane samarpit the ki ve paraspar abhivadan main bhi jai nagari kaa prayog karte the
 According to Acharya Kshemchandra Suman, the second novel of Hindi was written in 1872 by Vama Shikshakamunshi Kalyanraya together with Munshi Ishwari Prasad
 yah lagbhag 11 saal baad 1883 main meerut ke vidya darpan chhapekhane main mudrit hua tha
 Due to the efforts of these writers, Hindi publications also started in abundance at the end of the nineteenth century in Meerut, the stronghold district of Khadi Boli
 shuruaati daur main meerut ke puraani tehsil ke aasapaas hi adhikansh prakaashak the
 Apart from this, the present Subhash Bazar was also a publishing center
 meerut ke prakaashan udyog main swami tulsiram swami kaa baari yogadan tha
 He founded Swami Press in Meerut in 1885
 shuruaati daur main yahaan litho paddhti se chapai hoti thi
 Tulsiram was the president of Arya Samaj
 unhone budhaanaa get aryasamaj kii sthapana bhi kii thi
 The commentary of Samyaved is considered to be his major literary treatise
 iske alaava bhi unhone kai pustaken likhin or prakashit kin
 All these books were published from the owner press itself
 us samay swami press matadaata soochiyon ke prakaashan main kaaphi naam rakhata tha
 Voter lists up to Lucknow were published here
 unke pautra uma shankar sharma ne bataaya ki unke dadaji ke samay swami press apane samay kii bahut badi press hua karti thi
 At that time, about 200 workers used to work here
 apni pustakon or matdaan soochiyon ke alaava bhi swami press main kai prakaashan samoohon kii pustaken or anya samagriyaan prakashit hoti thim
 Tulsiram Ji also took out a monthly letter called Ved Prakash for the promotion of Vedic religion
 tulsiram kaa 42 saal kii avasthaa main hi nidhan ho gaya
 Now just the memories of this press are in the minds of some Meerut residents
 aryasamaj ke hi ek anya pratishthit vidwaan ghasiram eme elelbi ne bhi meerut ke prakaashan udyog ke vikaas main kaaphi yogadan diya
 He wrote many books
 iske alaava angreji bhashaa kii kuchhek pustakon kaa hindi anuwaad bhi kiya
 Presently, the publishing industry of Meerut has become a hub of academic publications as a whole
 haalanki 20veen shatabdi main hi meerut main is tarah kii pustakon ke prakaashan kii shuruyaat hui lekin 19veen shatabdi ke antim charan main vishay sambandhi gyaan dene vaale kai patr patrikaayen prakashit huin
 Weekly Urdu Papers were published from Meerut under the patronage of Sir William Myor
 yah sultan ul mudranalay main chhapata tha
 The material published in this paper was for the use of the students
 lagbhag dau sau saal pehle shuru meerut kaa prakaashan udyog ab pramukhatya shaikshik pustakon ke prakaashan tak kendrit hokar rah gaya he
 Till independence, Meerut was the major center for the sale of educational books
 us samay meerut main kai bade pustak vikreta the, jinka mukhya vyavsaay pustak vikray tha
 Also, he used to publish some books
 inamen ramnath kedarnath, jaiprakash nath and company, khayrati laal, rastogi and company, rajhans prakaashan aadi pramukh the
 At that time, the publication of educational books was mainly by the Government Publishing House
 uttar bharat ke kai shaharon main meerut se hi pathay pustaken jaati thim
 The situation changed after independence
 meerut kalege ke eme arthshaastra ke chaatr rajendra agarwal kii pahal se meerut ke prakaashan udyog ke swaroop main badlaav hua
 Rajendra Aggarwal first started a publishing business in the name of Bharat Bharti in 1950 from the hostel Madan Mohan of Meerut College
 baad main kalege prashasan kii aapatti ke baad kachhari road par kiraye par aphis liya
 At that time all the centers of book sale and publication in Meerut were in Subhash market
 subhash bazaar se baahar us samay prakaashan house kholane kii baat bhi nahin sochi ja sakati thi
 Initially many publishers then tried to convince Rajendra Agarwal
 lekin baad main dhire-dhire kamobesh sabhi bade prakaashak kachhari road par hi aa gaye
 Now, the road is also called the publication road
 is samay kachhari road par chitra prakaashan, nagin prakaashan, pragati prakaashan, jiaar bottla and sans, bharat bharti prakaashan aadi meerut ke bade prakashnon ke aphis bane hai
 Today there are many big names of educational publications in Meerut
 maatr das saal pehle shuru arihant prakaashan pratiyogi parikshaon ke prakaashan main puure desh main agrani he
 The situation now is that there will hardly be any shop in the whole country where there are no books published from Meerut
 meerut ko prakashnon kaa shahar bhi kaha ja saktaa he
 There is no official count of the publications of Meerut, but people associated with the publishing industry of Meerut believe that there are about 75 big and small publications in Meerut
 udyog se jude log iskaa salanaa turnover takreeban do sau karod maanate hai
 This business employs about one lakh people directly and indirectly
 vyavsaay ko is sthiti main pahunchane ke liye meerut ke prakashkon ne ji tod mehnat kii he

 you
rajupaluun main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke kadap jile kaa ek gaanv he
 a Chadar Maili Si is a 1986 Hindi language film
 2722 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 Assuming the birth of Jesus as base, 2722 BC or the year before his birth is displayed in this way
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 2722 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kali Yuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc
 sabase pehle shabd-sankalan bharat main bane
 This magnificent tradition of India is as old as the Vedas - at least five thousand years
 prajapati kashyap kaa nighantu sansar kaa pracheenatam shabd sankalan he
 1800 Vedic words have been collected in this
 nighantu par maharishi yask kii vyakhya 'nirukt' sansar kaa pehla shabdaarth kosh evam vishwakosh he
 The powerful link of this great series is 'namalinganushasan' or 'trikand' written by Amar Singh written in the sixth or seventh century, which the whole world knows as 'amarkosh'
 amarkosh ko vishwa kaa sarvapratham samaantar kosh kaha ja saktaa he
 In Sanskrit, the system of commentary, interpretation and commentary holds special significance
 praayah sabhi prakaar ke granthon main in tikaaon kaa vishesh mahatv he
 The reason for this is that in many commentaries, more things than the original, novel interpretation and refutation have been established by new ideas
 koshgranthon ke tikaakaron kaa krititv bhi bade mahatv kaa he
 While on one hand there are new words, new meanings and new interpretations, on the other hand the names of many lexicons and lexicons are also found
 anek to aise tikaakar hai jo swayan granthkaar he or swayampi jinhone apane granth kii tikaayen bhi likhi hai
 Most have only produced vaccines
 'amarkosh' kii tikaayen sarvaadhik or kadachit sarvapracheen bhi he
 They have also been translated into Hindi and other languages
 in tikaaon main anek purvavarti koshon yaa koshkaron ke naam or kabhi kabhi uddhran bhi milte he
 Amarkosh commentators 'kshiraswamy' and 'hemachandra' have indicated the non-synonymous and synonyms of poetry
 inase yah bhi lakshith hota he ki kabhi-kabhi shabd kii arthbodhak vyakhyaayein bhi vahaan thim, yatha— 'kshudra - chhidrasamopetan chaalanan titauh puman'
 Or 'skandhadudhwon Taro: Branch Katpree Vitpi Matha'
 hemchandra ne 30 koshkaron yaa koshon kaa ullekh kiya he
 On the basis of vaccine etc
, names like Tarapal, Durg, Dharanidhar, Dharmamuni, Rantidev, Rudra Vishwaroop, Bopdev, Shubhang, Vopalit, Krishnakavi etc
 are found
 'rakshas' yaa 'rabhas' ke shadarthcosh kaa bhi ullekh he
 There are also etymologies of words in these cells
 'amarkosh' kii 'ramashrayi' tikaa main prayek shabd kii panineey vyakarannusari vyutpatti do gai he
 Sometimes errors and sometimes experiments have also been reported
 sab milakar in tikaaon ko koshvaiumay kaa mahatvapurn ang kaha ja saktaa he
 In fact, they are the complementary parts of the cells
 inamen 'ukt, anukt or durukt' vishyon kaa vichaar or vivechan kiya gaya he
 Therefore, we should never forget their importance and contribution in the history of Sanskrit dictionaries
 aadhunik or paashchaatya koshon kii bhedakataayen mukhyatah nimnanirdisht ho sakati hai- In Europe, and partly in India - in the primitive period, difficult words were interpreted by simple words or expressions
 yorape main saamanytah ek paryaay de diya jaataa tha or bharat main vaidic nighantukaal se hi paryaayashabdon kaa arthbodhakparak ekatrikaran hota tha
 These were the main inspiration for the collection of imprecise and difficult words
 bhartiya koshon main bahuparyaay sangrah ke kaaran anek clisht shabdon ke saath paryaayavachi koshon main saral shabd bhi samavisht rahete the
 Nighantu's vocabulary is influenced by the compilation of mostly imprecise and thoughtful words rather than a collection of comprehensive vocabulary of Vedic poetry
 bharat ke pracheen kosh paryaayavachi yaa samanarthak the
 In the initial state, appendages were attached to these words
 aage chalakar nanarthak yaa anekarth shabdalipi kaa vistaar se akalan hone laga
 As a result, in many non-sanskrit lexicons of Sanskrit, there was mainly nomenclature and later on started becoming lignard
 paryaayavachi koshon kii sangrayojna vargparak ho gai thi
 The sequence of endings was adopted in the sequence scheme of non-word words
 par kabhi kabhai adivarna kaa aadhaar lekar varnmalansri shabd-kramyojna kaa prayaas bhi kiya gaya
 On the other hand, modern dictionaries give additional synonyms of minor dictionaries as well as semantic interpretations
 sanskrit main yah nahin tha
 Commentaries certainly did this work
 sanskrit ke samanarthak koshon kii bhanti aadhunik koshon main paryaay rakhane par aadhik bal dene cheshtaa nahin hoti
 Sometimes, due to the influence of Sanskrit lexicons, in Hindi, etc
, they also become eponymous dictionaries
 par vastut: ye kosh sanskrit koshon ke anvasheshmaatr he, aadhunik kosh nahin
 In the ancient lexicons of Sanskrit, there was mainly a collection of nampadas, avyābhābhā तथाas and kabhai at times
 vyakaran- prabhavit sangrahadrushti kaa mul kadachit panini ke dhatupath or ganapaathon main dikhaai padataa he
 Initially, Amarakala and thereafter, the main form of Sanskrit became Namaligāासaनात्मकāsika
 aadhunik koshon main rachanavidhan kii bhinnata ke kaaran ise anupayogi maanakar sarvatha tyaag diya gaya
 But useful instructions for grammatical knowledge and experimentation are assigned by each with a small number of symbols
 aaj ke shabdkoshon kaa nirmaan un samast janon ke liye hota he jo tattadbhashaon ke saral yaa kathin kisi bhi shabd kaa arth jaananaa chaahate he
 The main form of Sanskrit lexicon was poetic
 is kaaran uskaa adhikt: upyog ve hi kar pate the jo koshapadyon ko kanthsy kar rakhte the
 Along with experimentation and semantics, memorizing shells was also considered a purpose, but today's new dictionaries have no purpose at all
 sanskrit ke pracheen koshon kaa prayojan hota tha kaviyon, sahityanirmataaon or kavyashastradi ke pathakon ke shabdabhandar kii vruddhi karnaa
 But the main purpose of modern lexicons is to increase the power of their expedient usage by giving knowledge of the meaning of words and giving information about the related things
 inek atiritk shabdoccharan, vyutpattisuchan, shabdaprayog kaa pratham or yadi koi shabd luptprayog ho gaya ho to uskaa sapramaan aitihaasik varnan, naanaa artho kaa samaanya aban vishesh sandarbh- sanyutak vivitk vivaran, yogic evam muhaavaron ke shabdayogon tathaa dhaatuyogon aadi ke arthvaishishty kaa sodaaharan nirupan bhi aadhunik koshon main rahata he
 All this was not in the ancient dictionary
 koshtikaaon main avashya inamen se anek barte anshat: or prasangat: nidisht kar di jaati thim

 Comparing and organizing instruments on the basis of their complexity is misleading, as developments in instruments have sometimes reduced complexity

 Similarly, it is misleading to organize the development of instruments on the basis of workmanship, since all cultures develop at different levels and have different materials available
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek hi samay main maujuud do samskritiyaan, jinke gathan, samskruti or hastkala main bhinnata thi, unke dwaara banaae gaye vaadyayantra kii tulana karne kaa prayaas karne vaale maanavvigyaani yah nirdhaarit nahin kar sakate ki koun se vaadyayantra adhik "aadim" hai
 Sorting instruments based on geography is also partly unreliable, as one cannot determine when and how cultures approached each other and shared knowledge among themselves

 Scholars believe that there is no definite "invention" of the instrument, since the definition of the term "instrument" is completely subjective to both the scholar and the future-inventor

 The instruments that are considered to be the first instruments beyond the human body are rattles, stampers and various types of drums
 These early instruments evolved due to the human's impulse to add sound to emotional movements, such as dance
 Eventually, some cultures added ritual programs to their instruments
 Those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments, such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets
 Some of these labels have significantly different connotations than those used in modern times; Early flutes and trumpets were labeled as such for their original function and use, and not for any resemblance to modern instruments

 Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists have primarily characterized ceremonial instruments, historians have been able to distinguish between the six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: Concussion clubs, clappers, sistras, bells, cymbals, and Tingling
 Sistra is most clearly depicted in the great engravings of Amenhotep III, and is of particular interest in this because similar designs have been found in remote areas, such as among the Tbilisi, Georgia, and Yakui tribes native to the Americas
 The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments rather than any other instrument, as evidenced by their spread in Mesopotamia's sculptures, placards and seals

 There are many different ways to classify instruments

 Some methods arise as a result of disagreements between experts about how instruments should be classified
 jabaki vargeekaran pranali kaa puraa surveykshan karnaa is lekh ke daayre se pare he, pramukh pranaaliyon kaa ek saransh nimna he
 An ancient system, which dates back to at least the 1st century BC
 Coming from, the instruments are divided into four main classification groups: instruments where the sound is produced by moving strings; Instruments where sound is produced by the vibrations of air segments; Percussion instruments made of wood or metal; And leather-faced percussion instruments or drums
 victor-charles Mahillon later, adopted a very similar system
 He was the patron of the musical collection at the Conservatoire in Brussels and divided the instruments into four groups for the 1888 catalog of collections; Stringed instruments, howling instruments, percussion instruments and drums
 erik won hornbostel or court sacks ne baad main pracheen paddati ko liya or 1914 main Zeitschrift für Ethnologie main vargeekaran ke liye ek vyapak nai yojana prakashit kii
 His method is widely used today and is often referred to as the Hornbostel – Sachs method
 mul sacks-hornbostel paddati ne vaadyayantron ko chaar mukhya samoohon main vargeekrut kiya: Sachs later added a fifth class, electrophones, such as the thermines, which produce sounds electronically
 prayek varg ke bheetar kai up-samooh hai
 The system was criticized and revised in previous years, but it is widely used by organologists and ethnomusicologists only
 andre shafnar, Musée de l'homme ke sangrakshak, sacks-hornbostel pranali se asahmat the or unhone 1932 main apni khud kii pranali viksit kii
 Schaffner believed that the classification of an instrument should determine its anatomy rather than its method of playing
 unki paddati ne vaadyayantron ko do virgon main baanta: aise vaadya jinka sharir thos or kampan yukt he or aise vaadya jinamein compit hawa hoti he
 Western instruments, too, are often classified by their musical range when compared with other instruments of the same family
 in shabdaawaliyon ko gayan kii awaz ke vargeekaran ke aadhaar par rakhaa gaya he: Some instruments fall into more than one category: for example, the cello can be considered either a tenor or a bass, depending on how its music fits into the group and can be trombone alto, tenor
 , Or bass and French horn, bass, baritone, tenor, or alto, depending on which range it is played on
 saanchaa:vocal and instrumental pitch ranges Many instruments have range, as part of their name: soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, baritone saxophone, alto flute, bass flute, alto recorder, bass guitar, etc
 atirikt visheshan, sopraano range se upar yaa baas se neeche ke vaadya kaa varnan karte hai, udhaaharan ke liye: sopraanino sexophone, kontrabas clerinet
 When used in the name of an instrument, these terms are relative, describing the range of instruments in comparison to other instruments in their family and not in the range of human voices or instruments of other families
 For example, a bass flute has a range from C3 to F♯6, while a bass clarinet plays down an octave
 vaadya yantra kaa nirmaan ek vishesh vyavsaay he jiske liye varshon kaa prashikshan, abhyaas or kabhi-kabhi ek prashikshu banane kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Most manufacturers of instruments specialize in one style of instrumentation, for example, a luthear makes only stringed instruments
 kuch nirmaataa keval ek prakaar ke vaadya banaate hai jaise piano
 Regardless of how the sound is produced in the instrument, many instruments have a keyboard as the user interface
 kunjeepatal vaadyayantra, aise vaadyayantra hai jinhen jinhen ek sangeet kunjeepatal dwaara bajaayaa jaataa he
 Each key produces one or more sounds; In most keyboard instruments, there are additional means to fluctuate these sounds
 They can produce sound by moving or pumping air, by pushing or pulling the moving wires, by electronic means, or in some other way
 Sometimes, instruments that do not usually have a keyboard, such as the Gloukenspiel, have a keyboard attached to them
 haalanki unamem koi chalyman hissaa nahin hota he or unhen vadak ke haathon main pakade gaye mallett se bajaayaa jaataa he, unamem kunjiyon kii samaan bhautik vyavastha hoti he or ve samaan tareeke se dhwani tarange utpann karte hai

 The meaning of dharma is dharana, that is to say, dharma is the main thing
 gunon ko jo pradarshit kare vah dharm he
 Religion can also be called virtue
 yahan ullekhneey he ki dharm shabd main gun arth keval maanav se sambandhit nahin
 The word dharma is also used for matter, such as the religion of water is flowing, the religion of fire is light, giving heat and burning the thing in contact
 vyapaktaa ke drushtikon se dharm ko gun kahana sajiv, nirjeev donon ke arth main nitant hi upyukt he
 Religion is universal
 padaarth ho yaa maanav puri prithvi ke kisi bhi kone main baithe maanav yaa padaarth kaa dharm ek hi hota he
 There is no obstacle to his country, color
 dharm saarvkalik hota he yani ki prayek kaal main yug main dharm kaa swaroop vahi rahata he
 Religion never changes
 udhaaharan ke liye pani, agni aadi padaarth kaa dharm sristi nirmaan se aaj paryant samaan he
 There is a fundamental difference between religion and sect
 dharm kaa arth jab gun or jivan main dhaaran karne yogya hota he to vah prayek maanav ke liye samaan hona chahie
 When the religion of matter is universal, it should be universal for mankind as well
 atah maanav ke sandarbh main dharm kii baat karen to vah keval maanav dharm he
 Hinduism, Muslim, Christian, Jain or Buddhist etc
 are not just religions or communities
