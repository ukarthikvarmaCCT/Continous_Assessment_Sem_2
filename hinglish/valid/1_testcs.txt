 " Rejecting US concerns over the china-pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Pakistan Interior Minister Ehsan Iqbal said that Washington should not look at this multi-billion project from India's perspective because it will provide a platform that will benefit everyone
 Will deliver
 ikbaal ne apane bayaan main kaha ki sipiisi dakshin or madhya asia, pashchimi or africa deshon ko aarthik galiyare ke madhyam se bhugolic taur par jodne ke liye ek manch uplabdh karaayega
 CPEC, costing US $ 50 billion, will pass through Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (pok), on which India has conveyed its opposition to China

 Also read: china-pakistan Economic Corridor has no direct relation to Kashmir issue: China america raksha mantri james mattis ne pichley hafte kaha tha ki sipiisi vivaadit kshetra se gujarata he or america is tathy kii andekhi nahin kar saktaa
 However, Iqbal said that America's concern about CPEC is unfounded
 unhone kaha ki yah sabko phayda pahunchayegaa or ek aisa manch he jo dakshin or madhya asia, pashchimi or africa deshon ko aarthik galiyare ke madhyam se bhugolic taur par jodne ke liye ek manch uplabdh karaayega
 The comments unhone kaha ki america ko sipiisi ko bharat ke nazariye se nahin dekhnaa chahie, balki ise kshetra main shanti, sthirataa or samrudhta ke strot ke taur par dekhnaa chahie
 CPEC can bring much-awaited stability to the region which has been affected by the war for the past several decades
 unhone kaha ki agar america is kshetra ko bharat ke nazariye se dekhegaa to isse kshetra ke saath hi america hiton ko bhi nuksaan hoga
 It is therefore important that America should see this situation from an independent perspective, not from anyone else's perspective

 sipiisi is kshetra main bahupratikshit sthirataa laa saktaa he jo pichley kai dashakon se yuddh se prabhavit rahaa he
 He said that if America sees this region from the perspective of India, then it will harm the region as well as American interests

 More than 10,000 such schools defied the government, claiming that the Supreme Court had excluded them from the purview of Right to Education (RTE)
 maamla madhya pradesh hycourt pahunchaa jahaan is circular ko radd kar diya gaya
 State School Education Minister Archana Chitnis had said in a press release that due to the amendment of the Act, RTE will now be implemented in non-aided schools as well and only schools outside it where religious education is imparted
 isamen yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki yah sanshodhan pichley saal aae supreme court ke ek aadesh ke baad kiya gaya he
 The law department of the state government also opined that educational institutions of minorities, including Christian missionaries, where religious education is not imparted, fall under the purview of the RTE, therefore, such schools should be provided with 25 per cent seats for children from disadvantaged and weaker sections

 lekin jahaan tak meri jaankaree he, ham is kanoon ke daayre main nahin aate hai

 The dispute continued for almost a year

 It has been 18 days since the inundation in Char Dham and people are still stuck on the mountain
 inamen zyaadaatar sthaneey log bataae ja rahe hai
 Vijay Bahuguna's government has made 10 big mistakes in the pain of the mountain that the whole country has suffered
 yah sahi he ki kudarat ke kahar par kisi kaa vash nahin, lekin vijay bahuguna sarkaar ne aisi galtiyaan kii, jisane pahaad par ai traasadee ko or bhi vikaraal bana diya
 The Meteorological Department ignored the alert of the Meteorological Department before the tragedy
 The weather department had warned of the destruction two days before the flood of mountain, but the government slept with oil in its ear
 naa to logon ko khatre se baahar nikaala gaya or naa hi kisi ko maut ke kareeb jane se roka gaya
 After seeing what happened after that, the whole country cried

 But instead the government was busy giving the figure of deaths
 aapadaa ke baad teen din baad tak harakat main nahin ai sarkaaruttarakhand sarkaar ne traasadee kii gambhirtha samajhane or rescue oparation shuru karne main kaaphi vakt laga diya

 But despite earlier warnings, the government failed to take people to safe places
 raahat kaaryon main prashasan najar nahin ayarahat kaaryon main prashasan kii sabase zyada jarurat thi, lekin vahi nadaarad rahaa
 The government was expected to help the people through local administration, but this was not seen
 sena, suraksha agenciyon se talmail nahinvipadaa main fanse logon tak pahunchane ke liye sena or surakshakarmiyon ne rasta bana liya, lekin puure mishan main wo uttarakhand sarkaar hi gaayab rahi, jise pahaad par bane har raste kaa pataa tha
 Thousands of people missing even after 18 days, the failure was bigger than that of disaster
 hajaaron log ab bhi apano kii talash main jute hai, lekin jawaab dene vaala koi nahin
 If the plan of rehabilitation of the local people is not settled on the hill and the people trapped on the way are relieved, then how the condition of the camps is suffering
