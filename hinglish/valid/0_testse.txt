 Prabhat Prakashan New Delhi has published the following books of Devendra Swarup: devendra ji kii pustakon ke bahaane desh or kaal par samayik chintan, abhigaman tithi: 3 janvari 2014 Pangea, Pangea or Pangea, was a vast unified continent that existed during the Paleozoic and Mizozoic eras around 250 million years ago; The present continent has come out of this in its present form
 yah naam alfred vegener ke mahadwipiya pravaah ke siddhant kii vaigyanik charchaa main gadha gaya tha
 In his book, "the Origin of Continents and Oceans", he considered that all continents were part of a vast continent at one time, which he called "the continent", before subsequently disintegrating and flowing to their present places
 panzia shabd 1928 main alfred vegener ke siddhant par charchaa ke liye yojit ek sangoshtee ke dauraan prakaash main aayaa
 a large ocean that surrounded Pangea was named Panthalasa accordingly
 aisa prathit hota he ki vishaal mahadwipon kaa vikhandan or utpatti prithvi ke 4
6 billian varshon ke itihaas main kramagat he
 Many other constructions may also have occurred prior to Pangea
 antim se duusare, panotia kaa nirmaan 600 million varsh pehle proterojoik eon ke dauraan hua tha or yah 540 eme tak astitv main rahaa tha
 Rhodinia existed before Panotia, which existed from about 1

8 jie kii avadhi main bane colombia yaa nuna naamak ek puraane vishaal mahadweep ke vikhandan se utpann tukdon ke jamaa hone or judane se hua tha
 The exact configuration and geodynamics history of Rodinia is not as well understood as that of Panotia and Pangea
 When the fragmentation of Rodinia occurred, it was divided into three pieces: the vast continent of proto-lauresia, the vast continent of proto-gondwana, and relatively Small Congo Cretan
 proto-lauresia and proto-gondwanaland were separated by the proto-tethys Ocean
 proto-loresia ke swayan vibhajit hokar alag-alag hone ke turant baad laurenshia, siberia or baltic mahadwipon kaa nirmaan hua
 Its rift also created two new oceans, the Iapetus Ocean and the Paleocean Ocean
 baltic laurenshia ke purv main or siberia laurenshia ke uttar-purv main sthit tha
 Around 600 ma, most of these oceans came back together to form Panotia, a relatively short giant continent consisting of a large amount of land near the poles and just a relatively small strip connecting the polar oceans near the equator
 isaki utpatti ke keval 60 million varsh ke baad, lagbhag 540 eme, cambrian yug kii shuruyaat ke kareeb panotia phir se vikhandit ho gaya jisase laurenshia, baltic or gondvanaa ke dakshini vishaal mahadweep kaa janm hua
 In the Cambrian period, the independent continent of Laurentia, which became North America, became located on the equator with delimited oceans bounded on three sides: the Panthalassic Ocean to the north and west, the Ipitus Ocean to the south and the Khanty Ocean to the east
 Around 480 MA in the oldest Ordovician, the small continent of Avalonia, a part of land that formed the northeastern United States, Nova Scotia, and England, was liberated from Gondwana and began its journey towards Laurentia
 baltic, laurenshia or evalonia sabhi ordovisian kaal ke ant tak ek saath mil gaye or is tarah ipitas mahaasaagar ke nikat ek chote mahadweep kaa nirmaan hua jise uramerica yaa loresia kaha gaya
 The North Appalachians also originated as a result of the collision
 Siberia is located near Euramerica with the Khanty Ocean between the two continents
 jab ye sabhi ghatnaayen ho rahi thim, gondvanaa dhire-dhire dakshini dhruv kii ore khisak gaya
 This was the first phase of Pangea's origin
 panzia kii utpatti kaa doosraa charan tha gondvanaa ke saath uramerica kii takkar
 silurian kaal tak, 440 eme, baltic ne pehle hi laurenshia se takaraakar uramerica kaa nirmaan kar diya tha
 Avalonia had not yet collided with Laurentia, and a remnant of the Ipitus Ocean, a sea route between them, was still shrinking as Avalonia slowly slid towards Laurentia
 is bich dakshini europe gondvanaa se khandit ho gaya or navgathit rek mahaasaagar ke paar uramerica kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or devonian main dakshini baltic se takaraa gaya, haalanki yah chota mahadweep pani ke neeche kii ek pattee ke rup main tha
 The Khanty Ocean, a branch of the Ipitus Ocean, was also shrinking from Siberia as an island island that collided with the eastern Baltic
 is dweepiya vrutt ke peeche ek nayaa sagar, ural mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Towards the end of the Silurian period North and South China moved away from Gondwana and began to move northward across the shrinking proto-tethys Ocean, with the new paleo-tethys Ocean opening at its southern tip
 devonian kaal main gondvanaa swayan uramerica kii ore badhane laga tha jiske kaaran rek mahaasaagar sikud rahaa tha
 In the early Carboniferous era, northwest Africa touched the southeastern coast of Euramerica, starting to form the Appalachian Mountains and the southern parts of the Meseta Mountains
 dakshini america uttar disha main dakshini uramerica kii ore bad gaya tha jabaki gondvanaa ke purvi bhaag bumadhya rekha se dakshini dhruv kii ore badhane lage the
 North China and Southern China were located on independent continents
 chota mahadweep kazakhstania madhya carbonipheras yug main siberia se takaraa gaya tha
 Western Kazakhstania collided with the Baltic at the end of the Carboniferous Era, causing them to cease contact with the Ural Ocean and causing them to originate in the western proto-tethys Ural mountains and the vast continent Lauresia
 This was the last stage of Pangea's origin
 is bich dakshini america dakshini laurenshia se takaraa gaya tha jisase rek mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya tha or epalachiyans evam auchita parvaton ke sabase dakshini hisse kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 By this time Gondwana was located near the South Pole and glaciers were formed in Antarctica, India, Australia, South Africa, and South America
 uttari china kaa hissaa carbonipheras yug ke ant tak siberia se takaraa gaya tha or is tarah proto-tethis mahaasaagar puri tarah se band ho gaya tha
 At the beginning of the Permian era, the Cimmerian Plate split off from Gondwana and began to move towards Lauresia, creating a new ocean, the Tethys Ocean at its southern tip, and closing the path to the plato-tethys Ocean
 zyaadaatar bhu-bhaag abhi bhi ekikrut hi tha
 In the Triassic period, Pangea moved slightly in the southwest direction
 cimerian plate ab bhi sikudte peleo-tethis ke paar ja rahi thi jo jurassic kaal ke madhya tak jari rahaa
 peleo-tethis pashchim se purv tak band ho gaya tha or is tarah cimerian orogeni kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Pangea looked like the letter "C" in English, which contained an ocean, the new Tethys Ocean, inside the Sea
 jurassic kaal ke madhya tak panzia main daraar pad gayi thi, iske vikhandan kaa vivaran neeche diya gaya he
 Fossil-evidence of Pangea includes the presence of similar and integral species found on continents that have now gone far
 udhaaharan ke liye, therapcid listrosoras ke jeevashm dakshin africa, bharat or australia main glosopteris flora ke sadasyon ke saath-saath paae jate hai jinka vistaar dhruviya vrutt se lekar bumadhya rekha tak hua hoga, agar mahadweep apni vartmaan sthitiyon main rahe honge; isi tarah mithe pani ke sarisrup mizosoras keval brazil or pashchimi africa ke taton ke sthaneey kshetron main paae jate hai
 Additional evidence of Pangea is found in the geology of the adjacent continents, including the matching of geological trends between the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa
 carbonipheras kaal ke dhruviya barf kii parat ne panzia ke dakshini chor ko dhank liya tha
 Especially glacial collections and structures dating back to the same era are found on many different continents that may have been together in the Pangea continent
 dhruviya vichlan ke spasht margon kaa peleomagnetic adhyayan vishaal-mahadweep ke siddhant kaa bhi samarthan karata he
 Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; When rocks are formed, they absorb the magnetic properties of the Earth and indicate in which direction the poles are present relative to the rock
 chunki aavarti dhruvon kii ore chumbakeey dhruvon kaa jhukaav keval kuch hajaar varshon kii avadhi main hota he, ek spasht ausat dhruviya sthiti nirdhaarit karne ke liye kai hajaar varshon ke kai lava se maapan kaa ausat nikaala jaataa he
 Samples of sedimentary rocks and intrusive igneous rocks have a magnetic tilt which is usually an average of these 'similar shifts' in magnetic northward tilt as their magnetic fields do not immediately form as in the frosting lava
 Happens in the case
 namoona samoohon ke bich chumbakeey bhinnataayen jinaki umr main lakhon varshon kaa antar hota he, ek vaastavik dhruviya vichlan or mahadwipon kii halchal ke sanyukt kaaran aisa hota he
 The components of the true polarity deviation are the same for all samples and can be eliminated
 yah bhuvaigyanikon ko is bahaav kaa ek hissaa de detaa he jo mahadwipiya halchal ko dikhaata he or iskaa upyog pehle kii mahadwipiya sthitiyon ko punarnirdhaarit karne main madad ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The continuity of mountain ranges also provide evidence for Pangea
 iskaa ek udhaaharan epalchian parvat shrinkhalaa he jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america se lekar ireland, britain, greenland or scandinavia ke calladonids tak faili hui he
 Pangea had three major phases of fragmentation
 pehla charan praarambhik-madhya jurassic kaal main shuru hua tha jab panzia purv main tethis mahaasaagar se or pashchim main prashanth mahaasaagar se alag hona shuru hua, jisase antat vishaal mahadwipon loresia or gondvanaa kaa vikaas hua
 The rift that began to form between North America and Africa gave rise to many failed cracks
 a rift resulted in the creation of a new ocean, the North Atlantic Ocean
 atlantic mahaasaagar ek samaan rup se nahin khulaa tha; uttar-madhya atlantic main daraar bananaa shuru hua tha
 The South Atlantic did not open until the Cretaceous
 loresia ne dakshinavart main ghoomana shuru kar diya tha, yah uttar main uttar america evam dakshin main uresia kii ore bad gaya
 The path of the Tethys Ocean was also closed due to the rise of Lauresia in a clockwise direction
 isi bich africa ke duusari taraf purvi africa, antarctic or madagascar ke nikatavarti hashiyon ke saath ek nayaa daraar bhi bananaa shuru ho gaya tha jisase dakshin-pashchimi hind mahaasaagar kii utpatti hui, yah bhi criteshas main khul rahaa tha
 The second important phase of the fragmentation of Pangea began in the early Cretaceous period, when the small giant continent Gondwana split into several continents
 lagbhag 200 eme main simriya mahadweep upar varnit ke anusaar uresia se takaraa gaya 
 haalanki simriya ke takaraane ke saath hi ek sabadakshan kshetra nirmit ho gaya tha
 This subduction zone was called the Tethyan Trench
 yah samudri khai sambhawatah tethian mid-oshan rij ke rup main upashakhit ho gaya tha, yah rij tethis mahaasaagar ke vistaar ke liye jimmedaar tha
 This probably caused the northward movement of Africa, India and Australia
 praarambhik kriteshs kaal main atlantic jo aaj kaa dakshin america or africa he, antat purvi gondvanaa se alag ho gaya tha jisase "dakshin bhartiya mahaasaagar" kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 In the Middle Cretaceous period, Gondwana disintegrated and opened the way to the South Atlantic Ocean as South America began to move away from Africa to the west
 dakshin atlantic ek samaan rup se viksit nahin hua tha; balki yah uttar se dakshin kii ore daraar ke rup main bana tha
 Also Madagascar and India began to break away from the Antarctic at the same time and move northward, opening the way to the Indian Ocean
 madagascar or bharat criteshas kaal ke ant main 100-90 eme main ek duusare se alag ho gaye the
 India continued northward towards Eurasia at a speed of 15 cm per year and closed the Tethys Ocean, while Madagascar stayed there and settled in the African Plate
 newjiland, new calladonia or jeelandia kaa shesh bhaag australia se alag hone laga tha or prashanth kii disha main purv kii ore bad rahaa tha or isane coral sagar or tasman sagar kaa rasta khol diya tha
 The third important and final phase of the fragmentation of Pangea was completed in the early Sinozoic era
 loresia us samay alag hua jab uttar america / greenland uresia se mukt ho gaya or lagbhag 60-55 eme main isane norway ke sagar kaa maarg khol diya
 atlantic or hind mahaasaagar kaa vistaar hona jari rahaa or tethis mahaasaagar kaa maarg band ho gaya
 Meanwhile Australia split from the Antarctic and moved rapidly northward, just as India did more than 40 million years ago and is currently in a collision situation with East Asia
 australia or bharat donon is samay prati varsh 5-6 centimetre kii gati se purvottar disha main bad rahe hai
 The Antarctic has been in or near the South Pole since the origin of Pangea in about 280 MA
 bharat takreeban 35 eme kii shuruyaat main asia se takaraane laga tha jisase himalay kii orogeni kaa nirmaan hua or tethis kaa samudri maarg bhi antat band ho gaya; yah takkar aaj bhi jari he
 The African plate began to change its directions from west to northwest toward Europe and South America began to move northward, separating it from Antarctica and for the first time the entire ocean circulation around the Antarctic
 , Due to which the continent began to cool down rapidly and glaciers were formed
 Other significant events during the Sinozoic era included the opening of the Gulf of California, the rise of the Alps, and the formation of the Japanese sea
 great rift vaili main panzia kaa vikhandan aaj bhi jari he

 Psychosis or schizophrenia is a mental disorder
 isaki visheshtaayen hai- asaamaanya saamaajik vyavhaar tathaa vaastavik ko pahchaan paane main asamarthta
 This disorder is found in about 1% of people
 is rog main rogi ke vichaar, samveg tathaa vyavhaar main asaamanya badlaav aa jate hai jinke kaaran vah kuch samay liye apni jimmedaariyon tathaa apni dekhbhaal karne main asamarth ho jaataa he
 Both 'psychosis' and 'schizophrenia' literally mean 'breakdown of mind'
 sizophrenia ke kuch pramukh lakshan hai, jaise ki shuruuaat main :- It is not necessary that all these symptoms are seen in every patient, so if any of these symptoms are seen in any person, then he should seek psychiatric advice immediately
 schizophrenia kisi bhi jati, varg, dharm, ling, yaa umr ke vyakti ko ho saktaa he
 Like other diseases, the disease can also be inherited from close family members, so it is more likely to occur in the patient's children, or siblings
 atyadhik tanaav, saamaajik dabaav tathaa pareshaaniyaan bhi beemaari ko banaaye rakhane yaa thik na hone dene kaa kaaran ban sakati hai

 a review of clinical studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that these studies allow neither a reaffirmation or rejection of Schneider's claims and suggested that future clinical systems revisions may be the first The emphasis should be on the symptoms of the category
 schizophrenia kaa varnan aksar ek sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak lakshanon ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The term positive symptoms signifies symptoms that are not commonly experienced by most individuals but are present in schizophrenia

 Diagnosis is based on the individual's own experience report and abnormalities in behavior reported by family members, friends, or co-workers, and subsequently a clinical assessment conducted by a psychiatrist, social worker, clinical psychologist or other mental health professional
 manorog sambandhi moolyankan main ek manorog sambandhi itihaas or maansik sthiti pariksha ke kuch rup shaamil hote hai
 The most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia is the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition DSM-IV-TR and World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-10
 Is obtained

 The ICD-10 criteria emphasize first-class symptoms of Schneiderian, although, in practice, the synergy between the two regimes is very high
 diagnostic and statistical minial of mental disorders ke chaturth sanskaran ke anusaar, sizophrenia kaa nidaan karne ke liye, teen naidanik maandand puure kiye jane chahie: Schizophrenia cannot be diagnosed if symptoms of a mental condition or widespread developmental disorder are present, or if the symptoms are the direct result of a common medical condition or a substance, such as alcoholism or its medication

 schizophrenia ] a more general medical and neurological examination is required to rule out a health-related illness that can rarely cause symptoms similar to psychiatric schizophrenia, such as metabolic disturbances, serological infections, syphilis, HIV infection, epilepsy
 And brain wounds
 It may be necessary to remove unconsciousness, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, rapid attacks and unstable levels of consciousness, and indicates an underlying health disease
 aam taur par jaanch purvavastha prapti ke liye duhraaye nahin jate hai jab tak ki koi vishisht chikitsa sambandhi sanket nahin ho yaa manovikruti rodhi aushadhi kaa koi pratikul prabhaav nahin ho
 Greek σχίζω = "I refute") Despite the etymology of the word, "schizophrenia" does not mean double personality, DSM-IV-TR main schizophrenia ke paanch up-vargeekaran hai
 The ICD-10 defines two additional modalities
 schizophrenia kii vaidhata ko naidanik ikai ke rup main maanane hetu aalochana kii gai he kyonki isamen vaigyanik vaidhata or naidanik vishwasaneeyata kii kami paayi gai he
 In 2006, a group of mental patients and professionals from the UK debated under the flag of a movement to ban the schizophrenia label because it was rejected because clinical studies of schizophrenia were diversity-based and stain-linked and He called for the adoption of a biological-psychosocial model
 britain ke anya manochikitsakon ke samooh ne yah kah kar is prayaas kaa virodh kiya ki ek ek praavdhanik vichaardhaara hone ke baavjood schizophrenia shabd upyogi he
 The class of different types of schizophrenia used in DSM has also been criticized
 anya maansik vikaron ke samaan, kuch manochikitsakon ne suzav diya he ki anya vibhinnataaon ke saath vyaktigat ayaamon ke aadhaar par iske nidaan ko liya janaa chahie, jisase ki vahaan saamaanya or biimaar longon ke bich ek khai ke bajaae ek satatta bana rahe
 This approach seems very meaningful and serious for research on schizophrenia and its relevance to psychological experiences, which are mostly not stressful, and also build a clear trust among ordinary people
 is avlokan ke saath sahmati pragat karte hue manovaigyanik adgar jones or manochikitsak tony david tathaa nasir ghaemi ne bhranti par saahitiyon kaa paryvekshan karte hue ingit karte hue kaha ki mithyaa bhram kii paribhaasha kii samarupata or sampoornataa ko paane kii ichha bahut logon kii rahi he, mithyaa bhram na hi kabhi aavashyak rup se sthir hote hai, naa hi yah galat hota he or na hi inamen vartmaan kii niyantran ho sakane vaali ghatnaayen hi shaamil hoti hai
 Nancy Anderson, an emerging researcher in the field of schizophrenia, refutes the current DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria in her criticism of abandoning its validity for clinical improvement alone
 ve is baat par jor detii hai ki isaki naidanik vishwasaneeyata kaa sudhaar karte samay naidanik maapdandon kii manovikruti par adhik bal dene se iskaa moolbhoot gyaan ko ham baadhit kar dete hai jiskaa moolyankan karnaa prastutikarnon main isaki badi vibhinnata ke kaaran sambhav nahin he
 This ideology has also been considered by other psychiatrists

 Neuroscientific Michael Foster Green goes further to suggest that the presence of specific mechanisms of cognition impairment can be used to produce phenotypes that are purely symptom-based alternatives
 sah haniyaan baadhita yaa kami ke aadhaar par manovaigyanik gatividhiyon ke rup main parilakshith hoti hai jaise dimag, aakarshan, kaaryon kii kaarywahi or samasya ko suljhaana
 Removing influential factors from schizophrenia criteria, even though this therapeutic system is widespread, has also led to resistance
 DSM main se ise nikaal dene ke parinamswaroop ek "samaj main nahi aane vaale" alag prakaar kii vikruti – sizophreniavikruti ban kar saamne aayi he
 Referring to very weak reliability, some psychiatrists have completely opposed the idea of schizophrenia as a separate entity
 bhav vikruti or schizophrenia ke bich shrenikrut antar ko craayepelinian dishotomi kehete hai, jisane anuvaanshik epidemyology ke aankadon ko bhi chunauti di he
 Because the reliability of diagnostics creates difficulty in the measurement of its associated effects, examples suggest that genetic and environmental factors may play a role in mixers in schizophrenia outcome
 udaahranon se yah bhi pataa chalata he ki schizophrenia ke naidanik upachaar main mahatvapurn kaarak nihit hote hai lekin ve paryaavarniya karkon or tanaav paidaa karne vaale ghatakon ke mahatv ko prabhavit karte hai
 The implicit idea of overpopulation can be extracted biologically in some people and is known as the stress – diathesis model
 yah vichaar ki jeevigyaanik, manovaigyanik or manochikitsakeey tathaa saamaajik kaarak, sabhi mahatvapurn he, ise "biopsicososhal" model ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Generational assessments of schizophrenia have shown that the problem of isolating the effects of genetics and studies of isolated environments have shown that a high degree of heredity is found in it
 yah bhi suzav diya gaya he ki schizophrenia visham antarnihit anuvaanshiki ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen vibhinn bade or chote jokhimon ke jeens ke badhane ke saath hote hai
 Some people have suggested that it is necessary to have several genetic and other risk factors, before one is affected by it, but there is no certainty in it either
 Recent studies of the genome wide association for schizophrenia and commonly practiced disorders are largely isolated, but there are still some shortcomings between these two disorders
 anuvaanshik se jude adhyayan metaenalysis ne bahut hi gambhir or thos udhaaharan gun-sutreey kshetra main shankaaon ke badhane par prastut kiya he, jo pratyaksh rup se vikarayukt schizophrenia 1 jin protein se sampark karata he, jo haal hi main zinc pifungar protein 804e main shaamil he

 The affected person has fewer children than normal people

 The most prominent central anthropomorphic dilemma is why schizophrenia occurs, if the disease is due to the associated causes of biological heterogeneity, can this variation not be selected and separated? It is necessary to have a complementary and global feature to maintain a balance between such significant inequalities
 atah anumaanit visheshtaon ke sabhi siddhanton ko amaanya kar diya gaya he yaa ve mahatvaheen sabit hue hai
 The occurrence of contingency factors with early neurovicas also increases the risk of developing schizophrenia later

 Living in urban environments continuously for a long time has also been considered as a risk factor for schizophrenia
 saamaajik asuvidha ko bhi iskaa ek kaarak mana gaya he, jisamen garibi or saamaajik vishmata ke kaaran palaayan, rang yaa nasl bhed, parivaar kaa bikharana, berogari or kamjor rahan-sahan vyavastha aata he
 Childhood experiences of abuse or trauma have also been implicated later in life as a risk factor for the diagnosis of schizophrenia
 sizophrenia ke liye mata-pita kii dekhbhaal ko jimmedaar nahin mana gaya he lekin asahyogaatmak sambandhon kaa tut janaa bhi iske jokhimon ke badhane main sahaayak hota he
 However, in about half of schizophrenia patients, it was found that they used drugs or alcohol, which are difficult to prove the association between drug use and the apparent contingency of schizophrenia
 iske liye aksar istemaal kiye jane vaale do vyakhyaaon main hai "iskaa lagaataar istemaal sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he" or "iskaa lagaataar upyog hi chizophrenia kaa kaaran he" or yah donon baaten sahi hai
 The 2007 metaanalysis estimates that frequent use increases mental impairment based on the amount of the drug, including schizophrenia
 iske bahut hi kam udhaaharan hai jo yah bataate hai ki sharaab kaa seven sizophrenia kaa kaaran banataa he, yaa yah ki maansik rup se vyakti kisi vishesh dawa kaa chayan apane swayan ke upachaar ke liye kar letaa he, is sambhaavna kaa sahyog karne vaale kuch hi udhaaharan hai ki dawa kaa prayog pratikul maansik str kaa kaaran jaise maansik tanaav, jigyaasa, pareshaani, ubaaupan or akelepan kaa kaaran bhi ho saktaa he
 Because psychosis itself is highly understood and metaemphatime can result in the presence of cocaine use or cocaine-based psychosis with similar symptoms, even when the user is avoiding it
 manochikitsa virdohi andolan ke taur par jane jane vaale prayaas jo 1960 ke dashak main atyadhik sakriy the, rudhiwaadi medical vichaardhaara kaa virodh karte hai ki sizophrenia ek beemaari he
 Psychiatrist Thomas Sasas insists that the psychopath does not get sick, but that person gets lost in the unconventional thoughts and habits that our society considers inconvenient
 ve kehete hai ki samaaj in parais prakaar biimaar or unki aadaton ko vargeekrut karke unke saath anyaay karata he or unke prati kathorta kaa vyavhaar apane saamaajik niyantran ke adheen karata he
 According to this ideology, 'schizophrenia' does not occur but it is a type of social construction, created by those who distinguish between the normal and the unusual in society
 ssaaj ne manochikitsakeey upachaar ke maamle main apane aap ko kabhi bhi "manochikitsa virdohi" nahin samajha he, lekin ve aisa maanate hai ki vayaskon ke bich paraspar paraamarsh se upachaar prarambh kiya janaa chahie basharte iske ki ise vyakti kii ichha ke viruddh us par thopa jaae
 a set of informal psychiatric systems has been designed for the development and care of schizophrenia
 sangyaan main laae gaye paddhtiyon ko naidanik upachaaron ke jokhimon ke saath chinhit kiya gaya he, visheshkar jab vyakti tanaav yaa vismay kii sthiti main hota he, isaki haniyon par atyadhik dhyaan dena, nishkarshon par ekadam pahunch janaa, aakasmik aropan karnaa, saamaajik or maansik staron ke bare main baadhit yuktikaran karnaa, apane andar kii bhaavana ko kisi bahari strot dwaara vyakt nahin kar paanaa or praarambhik taur par drishy kii samasya kaa hona or isaki ekaagratha se dekhbhaal shaamil he
 Some of the well-known features are global neurocognitive impairment in the brain, attention, attention, problem diagnosis, action or social cognition, while others are associated with a particular case and experience
 "adhardaar prabhaav" ke saman taur par hone ke baavjood haal ke nishkarshon se pataa chalaa he ki kai vyaktiyon main sizophrenia ke dauraan ucch bhavuk pratiuttaron, visheshkar tanavagrast yaa nakaaratmak indrio or aisi vikruti ke samvedansheeltaa lakshanon ke samroop vyapti kaa kaaran bhi banati he
 Some examples suggest that the theme of ambiguous belief and the experience of psychosis may be characterized by a disorder characterized by emotion, and affect the symptoms of how a person interprets their experiences
 isaki haniyon ko dur rakhane ke liye "surakshit aadaton" kaa upyog isaki abhaason ke kram main sahaayak hota he
 Examples of the role of the psychological system come forward on the effect of therapies on the symptoms of schizophrenia
 mastishk kii karypranali main kriyaatmak bhinnataaon ke pareekshan ke liye tantrikeey manovaigyanik jaancho or mastishk pratirupan takneekon jaise fmri or PET dwaara kiye gaye adhyayanon se yah pataa chalaa he ki bhinnataayen adhiktar lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag, hippocampus or canapati ke hisson main paayi jaati hai
 These differences have been linked to neurocognitive cognitive impairments that are often considered insane / psychiatric
 mastishk ke mijolimbik maarg main dopamine kii karypranali par vishesh rup se dhyaan kendrit kiya gaya he
 a major reason for doing this is the finding of results from incidental studies that a group of drugs, which block the functioning of dopamine and known as phenothiazines, may reduce psychiatric symptoms
 is avadharana kii pushti is tathy bhi hoti he ki amphetamins, jo dopamine ke straav ko yaati he, sizophrenia kii sthiti main yah manorog ke lakshanon ko bigaad sakati he
 a dominant concept, also known as the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, states that over-activation of D2 receptors causes schizophrenia
 yadhyapi, sabhi manorog pratirodhi prabhaavon main aam, D2 avrodh ke aadhaar par 20 varshon tak yahi mana gaya jab tak ki 1990 ke daa ke madhya main PET or SPET pratirupan ke adhyayanon ne samarthak pramaan nahin die
 This interpretation is now considered to be extremely common, as one of the newer psychiatric resistant treatments is as effective as the old one, but it also affects the functioning of cirrotonin and may possibly have a slightly lower dopamine inhibitory effect
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main neurotransmeter glutamet or NMDA glutamet abhigraahak ke ghataae gaye prabhaav par bhi dhyaan diya gaya he
 This concept is also supported by the unusually low levels of glutamate receptors found in posthumous brain testing of people who were previously treated for schizophrenia 199, as well as the discovery that glutamate inhibitory drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine Can simulate symptoms and cognitive problems associated with these situations
 yah tathy ki glutamet abhigraahak ke kam prabhavali hone kaa matlab he lalaat / mastishk ke agr bhaag or hippocample kii karypranali kaa pataa lagane ke liye kiye janevaale jaanchon kaa sateek naa hona or yah ki glutamet dopamine kii karypranali ko prabhavit karata he, in sabhi ko sizophrenia main bhamil kiya gaya he, jinke chizophrenia main glutamet margon kii bhoomika main ek mahatvapurn madhyasth hone kaa pataa chalata he
 However, in the case of positive symptoms, glutamatergic treatment fails
 iske saath hi sizophrenia main mastishk ke kuch vishesh kshetron kii sanrachana or aakaar main bhinnataaon ke aadhaar par parinaamon main bhinnta dekhi jaati he
 Analysis of MRI studies in 2006 showed that for the first time patients with psychiatric symptoms had decreased overall brain and hippocampal volume, and that ventricular volume had increased, compared to patients with healthy controls
 haalanki, in adhyayanon ke anusaar wolum main ausat badlaav MRI ke tareekon dwaara tay kii gayi maapan seemaa ke najadik he, isliye yah tay karnaa bhosh rah jaataa he ki sizophrenia ek tantrikana prakriya he jo us samay bhaaru hoti he jab iske lakshan dikhaai padate hai, yaa yah ki ise ek aisi tantrikeey vikaas kii prakriya samajhnaa behatar he, jisamen kam umr main hi mastishk kii asaamaanya maatra taiyaar ho jaati he
 The psychoses of the first episode were associated with a significant reduction in psychiatric antidote drugs such as haloperidal, whereas the excessive decrease in gray matter volume was not associated with unusual psychiatric antidepressants such as olanzepine
 gairmanviya primets ke adhyayanon se pataa chalaa ki aadaar manorog pratirodhi dawaaon or asaamaanya manorog pratirodhi dawaaon, donon main grey or white matter main kami paayi gayi
 Analysis of diffusion tensor modeling studies in 2009 revealed two consecutive regions of fractional anisotropy reduction in schizophrenia
 One area was in the left frontal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, thalamus, and cingulate gyrus to the White Matter tract and the other area was in the temporal lobe, connecting the frontal lobe, insula, hippocampus amygdala, temporal, and occipital lobe
 Went across the White Matter tract
 lekhak kaa kahana he ki sizophrenia main white matter tract ke do network prabhavit ho sakate hai, jisase un grey matter kshetron ke 'sampark tut jane' kii sambhaavna rahati he jinase ye jude hote hai
 During fmri studies, a deep correlation between brain default networks and taskpositive networks was observed in schizophrenia patients and may demonstrate a high degree of adaptation to attention to chronological observation and external observation
 adhik virdohi do network ke bich sahasambandh network ke bich atyadhik pratidwandvita pataa chalata he
 There are no reliable measurements for the advanced stages of schizophrenia, although the concomitance of both genetic factors as well as nonadolescent psychoses may provide a better estimate of how later treatment may continue
 aise vyakti jo 'atyadhik jokhimpurna maansik avasthaa' kii shrenee main aate hai, jinamein sizophrenia kii paariwarik prishrubhumi ke sathsath asthaayee yaa swaniyantrit manovikrutiyon ke lakshan bhamil hai, unamem ek vashar ke baad kii paristhitiyon ke aadhaar par ilaaj kii sambhaavna 2040 pratit tak hoti he
 The use of psychiatric treatments and drugs has been found to be far more effective in reducing the likelihood of individuals in the category of 'highly risky' than in patients with fully developed schizophrenia
 haalanki, manorog pratirodhi ilaajon ke dushprabhavon ke sandarbh main, un logon kaa ilaaj kahin adhik vivaadit he, jo kabhi sizophrenia kaa car nahin hue, vishkar disphigaring taradive diskinesia ke lakshanon vaale or durlabh parantu kahin adhik maarak neuroleptic mailinent syndrome vaale rogiyon main

 New medical thinking suggests that even early intervention in psychiatric conditions is a retrograde preventive measure to prevent later episodes and the long-term disability associated with schizophrenia
 is rog se mukti kii avadharana abhi tak vivaadit he, kyonki isaki paribhaasha par koi ekamat nahin he, haalanki lakshno ko dur karne ke liye kuch upaay haal hi main sujhaaye gaye hai
 Effective treatment of schizophrenia is often considered to be dependent on standard methods, one of the most common methods being the measurement of positive and negative symptoms
 lakshno kaa prabandhan or kaaryakshmata ko uyana, rogamukti kii tulana main kahin adhik prabhavi mana jaataa he
 Its treatment was discovered in the mid-1950s with the development and presentation of chlorpromazine
 iske liye dhire-dhire ek recovery model ko apanaaya gaya, jisamen ummiido ko tane, saktikaran or saamaajik manyata par jor diya gaya
 Severe schizophrenia conditions may require hospitalization
 yah svaichhik yaa anaichhik bhi ho saktaa he
 Due to changes in the recruitment process, it is no longer common for this to remain in the hospital for a long time, although it may need to be done

 There is a belief among many non-western communities that schizophrenia can only be treated in more informal, community-controlled ways

 Many practitioners and researchers suspect that differences in respective levels of social engagement and acceptance are one of the reasons, however, that cultural studies are still needed to explain these results
 sizophrenia ke liye pehle str kaa manochikitsakeey ilaaj he manorog pratirodhi upachaar

 New and unusual anti-psychotic drugs are commonly used for chronic abnormal psychosis, but they are expensive and are prone to weight gain and obesity-related diseases
 san 2008 main, yues nashnal institute of mental health dwaara kiye gaye aakasmik pareekshan ke parinaamon main ye paaya gaya, ki ek pratham peedhee ke pratinidhi swaroop paaya jane vaala manovikruti rodhi, paraphanjin, anek naveen dawaaon ke 18 maah kii maatra kii apeksha adhik prabhaavshaalee va kifayati he
 The most unusual psychotic patient wanted to continue, ie olanzhapine, had risks of weight gain and metabolic disturbances
 chlojhapin un marijon ke liye sabase zyada asarkaari tha jo anya dawaaon par koi pratikriya nahin dete the
 Since its trial did not take patients with Tardive dyskinesia, its effects on these types of people could not be ascertained
 chunki isamen kaaphi kam pashchaat prabhaav saamne aae the jo ki gatishiltaa ko prabhavit kar sakate the, asaamaanya antipsycotics kai varshon se hi sizophrenia ke liye pratham pankti kaa ilaaj rahaa he, jab tak ki kuch dawaaon ko jo ki isi shrenee main the, unhe food and drug administration dwaara chizophrenia se peedit bacchon or kishoron ke liye hanirahit nahin maan liya gaya
 This benefit was definitely given, but with obesity and metabolic rate disturbance due to which its use remained questionable for a long time
 khaskar bacchon or kishoron main sizophrenia hone par unhe davaaiyon ke saath hi paariwarik vyavhaar chikitsa bhi di jaani chaiye
 Current criticisms have rebutted the claim that abnormal antipsychotics have some additional pyramidal postoperative effects, especially if it is taken in small quantities or chosen as an anti-psychosis of low potency
 sizophrenia se peedit mahilaon main asaamaanya manovikruti rodhi istemaal karne par prolactin ilveshan kaa asar dekha gaya he
 It is not yet known whether new antipsychotics reduce the risk of neuroleptic malignant syndromes, a rare but serious and dangerous neurological problem with the side effects of neuroleptic or psychotropic drugs

 For other patients who cannot or do not take regular medicines, long-term depot preparations of antipsychotics will be given every two weeks so that control can be done

 kuch yaa sabhi bhojan, peya yaa dono ke liye bina kuch avadhi tak rahanaa upwas kehalaata he
 Fasting can be complete or partial
 yah bahut choti avadhi se lekar mahino tak kaa ho saktaa he
 There are many forms of fasting
 dharmik evam aadhyatmik sadhana ke rup main pragaitihaasik kaal se hi upwas kaa prachlan he
 It is of many types
 is prakaar kaa upwas dharmik hota he, jo ekadshi, sankranti tathaa aise hi parvon ke dinon par kiya jaataa he
 In such fasts, sweets made of milk and both dry and green fruits can be eaten in the afternoon
 kuch nirjal upwas hote hai
 In these, nothing is eaten and water is consumed throughout the day
 rogon main bhi upwas karaayaa jaataa he, jisko langhan kehete hai
 Nowadays political fasts are also called which are called "fasts"
 inkaa uddeshy sarkaar kii drushti ko aakarshith karnaa or usase vah kaary karwaanaa hota he jiske liye upwas kiya jaataa he
 Sometimes fasting has to be done even after being unable to get food
 in sab prakaar ke upwaason kaa sharir par samaan prabhaav padataa he
 Once the food is consumed, the body gets strength from the food it has eaten for a few hours, but after that, the body starts using the ingredients of the diet - protein, carbohydrates and affection or fat - stored in the body
 vasa or carbohydrate parishram karne kii shakti utpann karte hai
 Protein work is to rebuild the broken parts of the body
 kintu jab upwas lanbaa yaa adhik kaal tak hota he to shakti utpaadan ke liye sharir protein kaa bhi upyog karata he
 Thus protein acts both in tissue building and power generation
 sharir main carbohydrate do roopon main vartmaan rahata he : glucose, jo rakt main pravaahit hota rahata he or galikogen, jo peshiyon or yakrut main sanchit rahata he
 Generally, carbohydrate is obtained from the body's daily food
 upwas kii avasthaa main jab rakt kaa glucose kharch ho jaataa he tab sanchit glicogen glucose main parinat hokar rakt main jaataa rahata he
 In the state of fasting, this accumulated carbohydrate is depleted within two to four days; Then carbohydrate has to be done by fat and also protein has to help in this work
 sharir main vasa vishesh maatra main twachaa ke neeche tathaa kalaon main sanchit rahati he
 There is a high amount of fat in gross body
 isi kaaran duble vyakti kii apeksha sthool vyakti adhik dinon tak bhookha rah saktaa he
 The body needs carbohydrate, fat and protein, all the three substances that it gets from its diet, for daily deeds and heat
 aahaar se uplabdh vasa yakrut main jaati he or vahaan par rasinic pratikriyaaon main vasaml or acito-aseetic-amla main parivartit hokar rakt main pravaahit hoti he tathaa sharir ko shakti or ushma pradaan rakati he
 The accumulated fat of the body in the state of fasting is used in this way by the liver
 yah sanchit vasa kuch saptahon tak carbohydrate kaa bhi sthaan grahan kar sakati he
 The only difference is that when the body continues to get carbohydrates from the diet, the aceto-acetic acid is administered by the liver in the same amount as the body requires
 carbohydrate kii anupasthiti main is amla kaa utpaadan vishesh tathaa adhik hota he or uskaa kuch ansh mutr main aane lagata he
 This fraction is called ketone
 Ketone found in urine is a sign of carbohydrate deficiency in the body and it means that the work of carbohydrate is now being done by the accumulated fat
 yah upwas kii praarambhavstha main hota he
 It is necessary to keep checking the ketones in the urine to know the metabolism of carbohydrates in the body when the patient does not take food during his illness
 upwas kii lambii avadhi main sanchit vasa ke samaapt ho jane par ushma or shakti ke utpaadan kaa bhaar protein par aa padataa he
 About 75 percent of the soft part of the body is made up of protein
 upwas kii avasthaa main yahi protein amino-amlon main parivartit hokar rakt main pravaahit hota he
 Proteins of all organs do not operate in the same amount
 lambey upwas main jab tak mastishk or hriday kaa bhaar praaia: 3 pratishat kam hota he, tab tak peshiyon kaa 30 pratishat bhaar kam ho jaataa he
 The main two functions of amino acids from bodily tissues are: to protect vital organs and to stabilize the required amount of glucose in the blood
 protein nitrogenyukt padaarth hote hai
 Therefore, when the body's proteins have to do the above work, then the nitrogenous fraction of urine increases
 upwas ke pehle saptaah main yah ansh prati din mutr ke saath lagbhag 10 gram nikalataa he
 Its volume decreases slightly in the second and third week
 yadi is nitrogeneey ansh ko baahar nikaalane main vrikk asamarth hote hai to vah ansh rakt main jane lagata he or vyakti main mutraraktata kii dasha main utpann ho jaati he
 This should be understood as the final state of the person
 sharir main carbohydrate or vasa ke samaan protein kaa sanchay nahin rahata
 The body is a living machine
 isaki rachana kaa aadhaar protein he
 The specialty of this device is that the proteins in its normal parts keep protecting the essential organs even during the fasting period
 shaareerik yantra kaa sucharu rup se kaary karte rahanaa sharir main bananevaale rasayanon, kinvon or hormonon par nirbhar rahata he
 They are also made in the state of fasting
 inke nirmaan ke liye sharir ke saamaanya bhaag apana protein amino-amla ke rup main pradaan karte rahete hai, jisase ye rasayinak padaarth banate rahen or sharir kii kriya main baadha na pade
 Daily amounts of protein are often fixed for a healthy body
 ek yuvak ke liye prati din prayek kilogram shaareerik bhaar ke anupaat main lagbhasg ek gram protein aavashyak he or yah aahaar se miltaa he
 a pregnant woman and a growing baby, child or teenager need 50 percent more protein
 isse adhik protein aahaar main rahane se sharir ko uskaa vishleshan karke bahishkaar karnaa padataa he, jisase yakrut or vrikk kaa kaary vyarth hi bad jaataa he
 Protein is used to repair the body apparatus
 atev rogottar tathaa upwasottar kaal main aahaar main protein badha dena chahie
 All these things can be traced to the risk of nitrogen balance
 yah kaam jeev-rasayan-prayogshaala main kiya jaataa he
 If the nitrogen content of urine is less than the nitrogen of food, then it is called "positive nitrogen balance"
 isse yah samajha jaataa he ki aahaar ke nitrogen main se sharir keval ek vishisht maatra ko grahan kar rahaa he
 If, on the contrary, the nitrogen of urine is high, it means that the body is also excluding nitrogen made from its protein
 is avasthaa ko "rinatmak nitrogen santulan" kehete hai
 In the fasting phase there is a "negative protein balance" and in the post-fast period, when there is sufficient amount of protein in the diet, there is a "positive protein balance"
 rog ke dinon main hamaare desh main bhojan praaia: band karke varjee, saboodana aadi hi diya jaataa he
 Due to this, the patient does not get even a small amount of protein, due to which the loss of organs is not complete
 atev sheergh pachnewali protein bhi kisi na kisi rup main rogi ko dena aavashyak he
 Protein is even more important in growing children and children
 upwas main kuch dinon tak shaareerik kriyaayein sanchit carbohydrate par, phir vishesh sanchit vasa par or ant main sharir ke protein par nirbhar rahati hai
 Examination of urine and blood can reveal the substances that the body is using at the time
 upwas kaa pratyaksh lakshan he vyakti kii shakti kaa nirantar hraas
 Body fat dissolves, muscles begin to fade
 uthanaa, baithna, karavat lenaa aadi vyakti ke liye dushkar ho jaataa he or ant main mutraraktata kii avasthaa main chetana bhi jaati rahati he
 Due to the lack of glucose in the blood, the body becomes tired and weak and finally the physical device stops its work
 1943 kii akalpidit bengal kii janata kaa vivaran bada hi bhayaavah he
 The social and moral outlook of this famine is very thrilling
 kintu uskaa vaigyanik adhyayan bada shikshaprad tha
 The science of fasting was of great benefit from the investigations which took place in relation to the Bubhkshitas
 ek drushtaant yah he ki in akalpidit bhukhmaron ke munh main doodh daalane se vah guda dwaara jaise kaa taisa turant baahar ho jaataa tha
 It seemed that there was no digestive juices in their intestines and there was no movement in them
 aisi avasthaa main shiraaon dwaara unhen bhojan diya jaataa tha
 Then after some time their stomachs started working and even then they could digest only the previously digested substances
 dhire-dhire unamem doodh tathaa anya aahaaron ko pachaane kii shakti aati thi
 Similarly, in the last world war, in countries where there was a lot of control over food items and the people could not get a complete diet for a long time, the symptoms were found and they were studied
 in adhyayanon se aahaar vigyaan or upwas sambandhi gyaan main vishesh vruddhi hui
 The health of such non-vegetarian people becomes very poor
 usamen rog pratirohak shakti nahin rah jaati
 In the last world war, due to lack of proper diet, how many children became blind, and many other diseases were affected
 upwas purna ho yaa adhuraa, thodi avadhi ke liye ho yaa lambii avadhi ke liye, chaahe dharm yaa raajnneeti par aadhaarit ho, sharir par uskaa prabhaav avadhi ke anusaar samaan hota he
 Long-term refreshments are the only changes in the body that occur in no time during a complete fast
 upwas todane ke bhi vishesh niyam hai
 The fast is usually broken with fruit juice
 ras bhi dhire-dhire dena chahie, jisase pachakpranali par vishesh bhaar na pade
 After taking a little juice for two to three days, the dietary solids should also be started in such a way that the stomach, etc
, which has been unaccustomed to digestion for some time, does not suddenly get a special weight
 aahaar kii maatra dhire-dhire badhaani chahie
 During this period, the body receives a significant amount of protein, it is also important to take care of it
 upwas prarambh hone par nity ke niyamanusaar bhojan se sharir ko shakti praapt nahin hoti, atev iske liye anya upaay kaamen laane chahie, yatha-shuddh vaayu or shuddh jal kaa upyog
 By breathing deeply in pure air, the poisonous elements already present in the blood are removed by the touch of life
 upwas kaal main koi aprakritik khaadya sharir main nahi jaataa, atev vijaateey dravya rakt main nahin milte tathaa uski shuddhi hoti he
 Sunlight bath provides many vitamins to the body and germs of diseases are destroyed
 upwas kaal main adhik pani pinaa chaiye, jisase ki adhik mutr visarjan ke madhyam se sharir se adhik gandagee baahar ho
 Urine is formed by filtering blood in the kidneys, so the excess of water in the blood clears more dirt
 upwas shaareerik sthiti evam rog ke anusaar 2-3 din se lekar nirantar do maas tak kiya ja saktaa hai
 Fasting for more than a week comes under the category of long fasting
 lambaa upwas atyant saavdhaanee purvak vidhivat kiya janaa chahie, anyathaa laabh ke sthaan par haani kaa bhay rahata hai
 Great care must be taken in breaking a long fast
 neembu ke pani yaa santare-mausami aadi ke ras se todna chahie
 Then fruits of the season should be taken for one day
 jitne din tak upwas kiya gaya ho, uske chauthai samay tak fal lene chahie, taduparant ann khaanaa chahie
 But it should be noted that after fasting do not take the wrong food again
 aisa karne par upwas kaa laabh bha jaataa rahegaa tathaa sharir shuddh ho jane par yadi vijaateey dravya sharir main jayega to puri maatra main vah sharir ke liye hanikaarak hoga

 It was aired on Zee TV from Monday to Friday at night
 iske samaapan ke baad iske sthaan par jamaai raja naamak dharawahik aarambh hua he
 In the context of Indian architecture, the outer hall standing on the pillars is called Mandap in which people perform various types of rituals
 jab ek hi mandir main ek se adhik mandap hote hai to unke naam bhi alag-alag hote hai
 The earliest human civilization of present-day Iraq region, that is, ancient Mesopotamia
 iskaa kaal isa ke purv 4500 se 1900 ke saal tak mana jaataa he
 Between 2300–2100 BC, Akkad gained supremacy over Sumer, but Sumer again strengthened after the fall of Akkad
 mana jaataa he sumer ke shaasha semetic nahin the - yani aaj ke yahudiyon yaa arab musalamaanon ke purvaj nahin the
 There seems to be an exchange between Sumeri and Akkadi languages
 pashchim ke devi devtaa Ammeter or 'ammometer' is a device used to measure the current flowing in a branch of a circuit
 bahut kam maatra vaali dhaaraon ko maapne ke liye prayukt yuktiyonko "milliametre" yaa "micrometre" kehete hai
 The earliest design of Ammeter was the d'arsonle's Dharmapi or the moving horoscope Dharmapi
 san 1820 i
 main ampiore ne avishkaar kiya ki yadi kisi chaalak ko, jisamen vidyutdhara pravaahit ho, chumbakeey kshetra main rakhaa jaae, to usapar ek bal kaary karata he
 The value of this force is equal to the product of the intensity of the magnetic field, the current and the length of the conductor
 is bal kii disha fleming ke baayein haath vaale niyam se gyaat kii jaati he
 Spread the thumb of your left hand, the finger near it and the middle finger of the middle in such a way that all three are perpendicular to each other
 yadi tarjani chumbakeey kshetra kii disha main or madhyamaa vidyutdhara kii disha main sanket karen, to chaalak kii gati anguthe kii disha main hogi
 When electric current flows in a coil placed in a magnetic field, a coaxial force acts on the coil, which it begins to rotate
 is siddhant ko kaam main laakar jo dharamapi banaae gaye, hai unhen chalkundal dharamapi kehete hai
 It consists of a rectangular coil with thin and electrified copper wire
 yah kundali phasphar branj kii bahut patali pattee dwaara ek pench se lataki rahati he, kundali kaa ek sira isi pattee se judaa rahata he or pattee kaa sambandh dharamapi ke e sanyojak pench se hota he
 The leaf also has a circular plane or concave mirror, which rotates along the leaf
 kundali kaa doosraa sira dhaatu kii ek sarpil kamaani se judaa rahata he, jiskaa sambandh duusare sanyojak pench se hota he
 This coil hangs between the poles of a powerful permanent umbilical magnet
 chumbak ke dhruv natodar belanaakaar akruti main kate rahete hai
 a soft iron small cylinder is enclosed in the back of the Dharmapi by a screw inside the coil between the two pole segments
 ye sab vastuen ek achumbakeey baks main band rakhi jaati hai
 Glass is placed in the front of the box, so that the mirror can be measured by deflection lamp and scale method
 jab kundali main vidyut dhara pravaahit hoti he, tab kundali ke do bhujaaon par balyugma kaary karata he or kundali ko uski sthiravastha se ghuma detaa he, jisase phosphor branj kii pattee or neeche kii sarpil kamaani main anthan aa jaati he or e anthan bal yugma kundali par vipareet disha main kaary karne lagata he
 Due to which the horoscope is soon in balance
 yadi kundali kaa vikshep kone tha ho, to dharaman nimna sutara se nikalataa he : That is, the current is proportional to the deflection angle
 ye dharamapi atyant sthaayee or yathesht sugranhak hote hai
 They can measure current up to 10 amperes
 chalkundal dharamapi mukhyatya do prakaar ke hote hai : In this, the coil is wrapped on a metal structure, which causes the coil to deflect quickly as the current flows
 jaise hi kundali gumti he, usamen or uske dhaatu ke dhaanche main bhavar dharaayen utpann hoti hai or kundali ko roak detii hai
 The horoscope does not oscillate, this is why this instrument is called dead-pulse
 dhara ke hatate hi kundali apni purv sthiti main pahunch jaati he
 Therefore, the value of the current can be determined very easily by the knowledge of the position of the coil and the position of the current
 is dharamapi main kundali ek achaalak dhaanche par bandhi rahati he or is kaaran usamen bhavar dhara nahin utpann hoti
 Hence there is very little resistance in the coil deflection
 kundali dhaatu ke dhaanche par aavisht na hone se dhara pravaahit kiye jane par, apni vikshepasthiti ke donon ore dolan karti he
 It is very sensitive and we can determine the transient charge before it is very accessible
 ye do prakaar ke hote hai : aakarshanwale tathaa pratikarshanwale
 If current flows through a stationary coil of insulating wires, a magnetic field is produced in and around the coil
 is kundali ke paas yadi kachche lohe kaa ek tukdaa lataka diya jaae, to vah kundali kii ore aakarshith ho jaataa he
 If this iron piece is fitted with an indicator, the indicator will also be deflected
 yadi koi aisi vyavastha ho ki lohe ke tukade par jo aakarshan bal he uske vipareet bal lagaakar use santulan main laayaa ja sake, to dhara kaa maan sanketak ke vikshep se pataa chal sakegaa
 Often this attraction is opposed by a spiral spring
 aakarshan bal dhara-maan ke varg ke samaanupati hota he
 Therefore the deflection of the indicator will also be proportional to the square of the current value
 isi kaaran yah prayavarti dhara kaa maan bhi gyaat kar saktaa he
 Between the stationary coils of several wheels of insulating wires, two soft iron thin rods are parallel to the axis of the coil
 ek chad to sthir rahata he, doosraa ek sanketak se judaa he jo swayan ek keel par laga he
 The other end of the indicator rotates on a dial
 jab kundali main dhara pravaahat hoti he, tab donon chad ek hi prakaar ke prerit chumbak ho jate hai
 According to magnetic laws they have repulsion and the iron attached to the indicator rotates, causing a deflection in the indicator
 isamen bhi vikshepanakon dharaman ke varg kaa samaanupati hota he
 These instruments are very simple and cheap
 jab naapane main bahut yatharthata kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti or anek pusht yantron kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, tab isi siddhant par bane ameter or voltmapi prayog main laae jate hai
 In power houses, soft iron devices are mostly used on switchboards
 prerit chumbak main aakarshan yaa pratikarshan dharapravaah kii disha par nirbhar nahin hota
 The force is proportional to the square of the torrent
 is kaaran dhara pravaah kii disha kuch bhi ho, bal kii disha ek hi hoti he
 For these reasons, these instruments are used to measure both direct current or reverse current
 kundali ke prerakatv ke kaaran ye ucch aavriti kii prayavartin dhara ke maapnkaarya main nahin prayukt kiye ja sakate
 This type of ammeter depends on the thermal effect of the current
 jab dhara kisi chaalak se pravaahit hoti he, tab vah chaalak tapt ho jaataa he
 The value of the generated heat is proportional to 2 x
 yadi dhara ampiore main or pratirodh om main ho, to The value of heat is proportional to the square of the current, that is, it is not dependent on the direction of current
 isliye aise emeter dishtdhaara athwa prayavarti dhara donon hi ke naapane ke prayog main laae ja sakate hai
 This effect has been used in two ways in the measurement method: pehle prakaar kaa yantra sabase pehle 1883 main major kardyu ne banaaya tha
 hartmann-bron improved it
 taar main dhara bahati he or tapt hone ke kaaran usamen prasar hota he
 At this time, the segmental wire attached to the middle pulls the wire and the pulley rotates according to the spread
 saath hi saath ghirani main laga sanketak bhi vikshepit hota he or dhara kaa maan dial par darshit karata he
 In the absence of current, the wire gets cold and shrinks and the indicator then returns to its former state
 aise dharamapi saral or saste hone ke kaaran bahut prayog main laae gaye hai
 They do not have a coil, so they do not have inductance and a high frequency alternating current is also measured, but they are not sufficiently accurate and are unable to tolerate high currents
 inase adhik suvidhajanak or yatharth taapyugma vaale dharamapi hote hai
 Nowadays, high frequency alternating current is mostly measured by the same instruments
 dhara taar se pravaahit hokar use tapt karti he
 The confluence of the copper constanton temperature coupled to this wire is also heated
 is kaaran taapyugma main taap ke anupaat main vidyut vaahak bal utpann hota he
 It flows in a direct currentometer
 iske dial main anshankan rahane par vah pehali prayavarti dhara kaa maan pradarshit karata he

 Rajya Sabha is the upper house of Indian democracy
 loksabhaa nichali pratinidhi sabha he
 The Rajya Sabha consists of 245 members
 jiname 12 sadsy bharat ke raashtrapati ke dwaara namankit hote hai
 These are called 'nominated members'
 anya sadasyon kaa chunaav hota he
 Members are elected in the Rajya Sabha for 6 years, in which one-third of the members are retired every 2 years

 The Rajya Sabha has been formed due to this principle
 isi kaaran rajya sabha ko sadanon kii samanta ke rup main dekha jaataa he jiskaa gathan hi sansad ke dwitiya sadan ke rup main hua he
 The Rajya Sabha has been constituted as a review house to review the proposals passed by the Lok Sabha
 yah mantriparishad main visheshgyon kii kami bhi puri kar sakati he kyonki kam se kam 12 visheshgy to is main manonith hote hi hai
 All proposals for imposition of emergency which go before the President must also be passed by the Rajya Sabha

 The Vice President of India is the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
 rajyasabha kaa pehla satr 13 may 1952 ko hua tha
 Rajya Sabha is a name that was announced on 23 August 1954 in the House by the Chair
 isaki apni khaas visheshtaayen hai
 The Second House in India began with the 1918 montague-chelmsford Report
 bharat sarkaar adhinium, 1919 main tatkaaleen vidhanmandal ke dwitiya sadan ke taur par council of stats kaa srijan karne kaa upbandh kiya gaya jiskaa visheshadhikaar simit tha or jo vastut: 1921 main astitv main aayaa
 The governor-general was the ex-officio Chairman of the then Council of States
 bharat sarkaar adhinium, 1935 ke madhyam se iske gathan main shaayad hi koi parivartan kiye gaye
 The Constituent Assembly, which first met on 9 December 1946, also served as the Central Legislature until 1950, then it was converted into a 'provisional Parliament'
 is avadhi ke dauraan, kendriya vidhanmandal jise 'samvidhan sabha' or aage chalakar 'anantim sansad' kaha gaya, 1952 main pehle chunaav karaae jane tak, ek-sadani rahaa
 There was a wide debate in the Constituent Assembly regarding the usefulness or inefficiency of the Second House in independent India, and ultimately the decision to create a bicameral legislature for independent India was mainly because the federal system was considered the most for such a large country with immense diversities
 It was considered a natural form of government
 vastut:, ek pratyaksh rup se nirvaachit ekal sabha ko swatantra bharat ke samaksh aane vaali chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye aparyaapt samajha gaya
 Hence, a second house known as the 'council of States' was created whose structure and electoral system was completely different from the directly elected Lok Sabha
 ise ek aisa anya sadan samajha gaya, jisaki sadsy sankhya lok sabha se kam he
 It was meant to be a confederate house, ie an assembly which was elected by the elected members of the states and two union territories in which the states were not given equal representation
 nirvaachit sadasyon ke alaava, raashtrapati dwaara sabha ke liye baarah sadasyon ke namanirdesan kaa bhi upbandh kiya gaya
 The minimum age for its membership was fixed at thirty years while for the lower house it is twenty five years
 council of stats kii sabha main garima or pratishtha ke avyav sanyojit kiye gaye
 This was done by making the Vice President of India the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, who presides over its meetings
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 80 main rajya sabha ke sadasyon kii adhiktam sankhya 250 nirdhaarit kii gai he, jinamein se 12 sadsy raashtrapati dwaara namanirdeshit kiye jate hai or 238 sadsy rajyon ke or sangh rajya kshetron ke pratinidhi hote hai
 However, the current strength of Rajya Sabha is 245, out of which 233 are representatives of the Member States and the Union Territory of Delhi and Puducherry and 12 are nominated by the President
 raashtrapati dwaara namanirdeshit kiye jane vaale sadsy aise vyakti honge jinhen sahitya, vigyaan, kala or samaaj seva jaise vishyon ke sambandh main vishesh gyaan yaa vyaavhaarik anubhav he
 The Fourth Schedule to the Constitution provides for allocation of seats to the States and Union Territories in the Rajya Sabha
 sthanon kaa aavanton prayek rajya kii jansankhya ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he
 As a result of the reorganization of states and the formation of new states, the number of elected seats in the Rajya Sabha allotted to the States and Union Territories has been changing from time to time since 1952
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 84 main sansad kii sadsyta ke liye arhataaen nirdhaarit kii gai hai
 To qualify for membership of Rajya Sabha, a person must have the following qualifications: use bharat kaa naagarik hona chahie or nirvachan ayog dwaara is nimitt praadhikrut kisi vyakti ke samaksh teesri anusuchee main is prayojan ke liye die gaye praroop ke anusaar shapath lenaa chahie yaa pratigyaan karnaa chahie or us par apane hastakshar karne chahie; He must be at least thirty years of age; uske paas aisi anya arhataaen honi chahie jo sansad dwaara banaai gai kisi vidhi dwaara yaa uske adheen is nimitt vihit kii jaaen
 Disqualification samvidhan ke anuchhed 102 main yah nirdhaarit kiya gaya he ki koi vyakti sansad ke kisi sadan kaa sadsy chune jane ke liye or sadsy hone ke liye nirarhit hoga- If he holds an office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State, except in a post which the holder of which is not disqualified, declared by law by Parliament; yadi vah vikrutchit he or sakasham nyaayalay kii aisi ghoshnaa vidyaman he; If he is undischarged bankrupt; yadi vah bharat kaa naagarik nahin he yaa usne kisi videshi rajya kii naagarikta swechha se arjeet kar lee he yaa vah kisi videshi rajya ke prati nishtha yaa anushakti ko abhisvikaar kiye hue hai; If he is thus disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament
 spashtikaran-is khand ke prayojanon ke liye, koi vyakti keval is kaaran bharat sarkaar ke yaa kisi rajya kii sarkaar ke adheen laabh kaa pad dhaaran karne vaala nahin samajha jayega ki vah sangh kaa yaa aise rajya kaa mantri he
 In addition, the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution provides for disqualification of members on the basis of change of party
 dasvin anusuchee ke upbandhon ke anusaar, koi sadsy ek sadsy ke rup main us dasha main nirarhit hoga, yadi vah swechha se apane raajnneetik dal kii sadsyta chhod detaa he; yaa vah aise raajnneetik dal dwaara, jiskaa vah sadsy he, die gaye kisi nidesh ke viruddh sadan main matdaan karata he yaa matdaan karne se virat rahata he or aise matdaan yaa matdaan karne se virat rahane ko us raajnneetik dal dwaara pandraa din ke bheetar maaf nahin kiya gaya he
 a member elected as an independent candidate will be disqualified if he joins any political party after his election
 tathaapi, raashtrapati dwaara sadan ke kisi namanirdeshit sadsy ko kisi raajnneetik dal main sammilit hone kii anumati hogi yadi vah sadan main apana sthaan grahan karne ke pehle chah maas ke bheetar aisa karata / karti he
 a member will not be disqualified on this basis if he / she voluntarily relinquishes membership of his / her political party after being elected Deputy Chairman of Rajya Sabha
 rajya sabha main rajyon or sangh rajya kshetron ke pratinidhiyon kaa nirvachan apratyaksh nirvachan paddati dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The representatives of each state and two union territories are elected according to the proportional representation system by a single transferable vote by the elected members of the legislative assembly of that state and the members of the electoral college of that union territory, as the case may be
 dilli rashtriya rajdhani kshetra ke nirvaachak mandal main dilli vidhaan sabha ke nirvaachit sadsy or puducheri sangh rajya kshetra ke nirvaachak mandal main puducheri vidhaan sabha ke nirvaachit sadsy shaamil hai
 The Rajya Sabha is a permanent house and does not dissolve
 tathaapi, prayek do varsh baad rajya sabha ke ek-tihaai sadsy seva-nivrutt ho jate hai
 a member elected for a full-time term serves for a term of six years
 kisi sadsy ke kaarykaal kii samaapti par sevanivritti ko chhodkar anyathaa utpann hui rikti ko bharne ke liye karaayaa gaya nirvachan 'up-chunaav' kehalaata he
 a member elected in a by-election may remain a member for the remainder of the term of the member who had resigned or died or who was disqualified to be a member of the House under the Tenth Schedule
 rajya sabha ke peethasin adhikariyon kii yah jimmedaari hoti he ki ve sabha kii kaarywahi kaa sanchaalan karen
 The Vice President of India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
 rajya sabha ke sadasyon ke vipareet rajyasabha ke sabhapati kaa kaarykaal 5 varshon kaa hi hota he, rajya sabha apane sadasyon main se ek upasabhapati kaa bhi chayan karti he
 The Rajya Sabha also consists of a panel of Deputy Speaker, whose members are nominated by the Chairman, Rajya Sabha
 sabhapati or upasabhapati kii anupasthiti main, upsabhadhyakshon ke panel se ek sadsy sabha kii kaarywahi kaa sabhapatitv karata he
 Unlike the Lok Sabha, the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha gives his resignation not to the Deputy Chairman but to the President
 mahasachiv kii niyukti rajya sabha ke sabhapati dwaara kii jaati he or unka rank sangh ke sarvocch civil sevak ke samatuly hota he
 The secretary-general works anonymously and is readily available to the Presiding Officers for advice on parliamentary matters
 mahasachiv rajya sabha sachivalay ke prashasnic pramukh or sabha ke abhilekhon ke sangrakshak bhi hai
 He works under the direction and control of the Chairman, Rajya Sabha
 samvidhan ke anuchhed 75 ke adheen, mantri parishad samuhik rup se lok sabha ke prati jimmedaar hoti he jiskaa aashay yah he ki rajya sabha sarkaar ko bana yaa gira nahin sakati he
 However, it can control the government and this task becomes especially important when the government does not get majority in Rajya Sabha
 kisi saamaanya vidhaan kii dasha main, donon sabhaaon ke bich gatirodh dur karne ke liye, samvidhan main donon sabhaaon kii sanyukt baithak bulaane kaa upbandh he
 In fact, there have been three such occasions in the past when Parliament meetings were held jointly to resolve differences between them
 sanyukt baithak main uthaaye jane vaale muddon kaa nirnay donon sabhaaon main upasthit or mat dene vaale sadasyon kii kul sankhya ke bahumat se kiya jaataa he
 The joint meeting is held in the Central Hall of Parliament House which is presided over by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha
 tathaapi, dhan vidheyak kii dasha main, samvidhan main donon sabhaaon kii sanyukt baithak bulaane kaa koi upbandh nahin he, kyonki lok sabha ko vittiya maamalon main rajya sabha kii tulana main pramukhataa hasil he
 In relation to the Constitution Amendment Bill, the Constitution provides that such a Bill has to be passed by both the Houses by a specific majority, as prescribed under Article 368 of the Constitution
 at:, samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ke sambandh main donon sabhaaon ke bich gatirodh ko dur karne kaa koi upbandh nahin he
 Ministers can be from any House of Parliament
 is sambandh main samvidhan sabhaaon ke bich koi bhed nahin karata he
 Every minister has the right to speak in any assembly and to participate in its proceedings, but he is entitled to vote in the same assembly of which he is a member
 isi prakaar, sansad kii sabhaaon, unke sadasyon or unki samitiyon kii shaktiyon, visheshadhikaron or unmuktiyon ke sambandh main, donon sabhaaon ko samvidhan dwaara bilkul samaan dharaatal par rakhaa gaya he
 Other important matters in respect of which the two Houses have similar powers are: - Election and impeachment of the President, Election of vice-president, approval of Proclamation of Emergency, Proclamation related to failure of constitutional machinery in States and Financial Emergency
 vibhinn sanvaidhanik praadhikaranon aadi se prativedan tathaa patr praapt karne ke sambandh main, donon sabhaaon ko samaan shaktiyaan praapt hai
 Thus, it is clear that the two Houses have equal powers except in the case of collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers and certain financial matters which fall under the jurisdiction of the Lok Sabha only
 ek parisangheey sadan hone ke naate rajya sabha ko samvidhan ke adheen kuch vishesh shaktiyaan praapt hai
 The Rajya Sabha has three special powers
 vidhaan se sambandhit sabhi vishyon / kshetron ko teen soochiyon main vibhajit kiya gaya he- sangh suchi, rajya suchi or samavarti suchi
 Union and state lists are mutually excluded - no one can legislate on a subject placed in the territory of another

 Emperor Ashoka is also known for his efficient administration and the promotion of Buddhism from his vast empire
 samraat ashok ne sampurna asia main tathaa anya aaj ke sabhi mahadwipon main bhi buddha dharm dharm kaa prachaar kiya
 Pillars and inscriptions of Emperor Ashoka's reference still appear in many places in India

 Although his generals suppressed the rebellion, his identity was kept secret as his brother Sushim feared to be killed after he came to know about it by a spy trap spread by the Mauryas
 vah buddha sanyaasiyon ke saath rahaa tha
 During this time he came to know Buddhist laws and teachings
 yahan par ek sundari, jiskaa naam devi tha, usase ashok ko prem ho gaya
 After recovering, Ashok married him
 kuch varshon ke baad susheem se tang aa chuke logon ne ashok ko rajsinghaasana hathiyaa lene ke liye protsaahit kiya, kyonki samraat bindusaar vruddh tathaa rugn ho chale the

 saath hi chakra kii banaavat dhul or pani ke liye abhedya honi chahie
 Nowadays there is more prevalence of ratchet tooth free cycle
 iske ghere kii bhitari paridhi par ratchet ke daant kate hai, jinamein yathasthaan lagaae kute atakkar, pedal kii zanjeer ke madhyam se savaar dwaara die hue khinchaav ko pahie kii naabhi par pareshit kar dete hai
 The paddle stops chained as soon as it stops, and the dogs fall back and forth into the ratchet's teeth with the force of the segmental, causing the sound of "cuttings"
 yadi dubaara chalaane par mukt chakra phisalane lage, athwa jam ho jaae, to use thik karne kii pehali tarkeeb yah he ki usamen mitti kaa tel khub bharkar pahie ko khaali ghumaya jaae, jab vah sab tel nikal chuke tab usamen snehan tel de diya jaae
 If the Ab is not far, then the lid of the Chakra should be opened to see if the dogs have been eroded, or their commands have been broken
 phir use bheetar se bilkul saaf kar toote purje yaa goliyaan nai badalakar, dhakkan kii chudiyaan saavdhaanee se sidhi kas deni chahie
 To hold the tire on the wheel circle, it is made of either steel wire, or a hard knot of rubber on both sides of the wheel, which is clamped under the folded edge of the wheel and stuck to the inner rubber tube When the air is filled, the tire gets diluted and sits in place
 bhitari nalee main itani hi daab se hawa bharani chahie jisase tair savaar kaa bojha sah le or pahie kaa gheraa sadak ke kankad pattharon se nahin takaraae, anyathaa nalee ke kuchle jane or tair ke fat jane kaa dar rahegaa
 Overloading the tire reduces the flexibility of the tire to bounce on the bicycle road, but tightly inflating the required amount increases the diameter of the wheel to its limit and less power than the pedals when running on good roads Has to be imposed
 bhitari nalee main hawa bharne ke liye bud ke hawa valb kaa bahudhaa prayog hota he, jisaki banaavat chitra 13
 main spasht dikhaai gai he
 The rubber wall tube should not be torn, crushed and rotten
 balve ke plag ke upree sire par laganevaali topi sadaiv lagi rahani chahie
 The base of the balves should be tightened tightly on the nut circle
 balve kaa plag, rabar ke balve tub sahit bina rukaawat ke pravisht hokar, khaanchon main baith janaa chahie
 Paddle cracks are attached to their axles by cotters only
 bisikil ke girane, athwa durghatana ke kaaran, yadi crack yaa dhuree tedi ho jaaen, to krinkon ko juda karne ke liye, unpar lage cotter ke nat ko kholkar, kater ke chudeedaar sire ko hathode se thonk kar cotter ko nikaal lenaa chahie, lekin dhyaan rahe ki chudiyaan kharaab na ho jaaen
 Cotters should be applied only after applying any iron under the chest of the crank, otherwise the crank will hit the spindle or ball bearings
 kharabi ke kaaran yadi donon crank ek sidh main na hon, to cotter ke chapate bhaag ko retkar, yaa palatakar, samanjit kar dena chahie
 If the crank is loose on its axis, pushing the cotter to a greater depth is also useful
 bahut dinon tak deele cotter se hi bisikil chalaate rahane se cotter or crank kaa chhed, donon hi, cat jate hai tathaa dhuree kaa khaanchaa bhi bighad jaataa he
 So it is better to change the new couture
 bisikil ke girane se akasar pedal pin bhi tedi ho jaati he
 In such a condition, take off the cap of the waring on the outside of the pedal and take out the cone cone and take the tablets in your hand
 phir pedal kii frem ko sarkaakar, bhitaravale vering kii goliyaan bhi samhaalkar le leni chahie, aisa karne par pedal nikal aayega or padalpin hi crank main lagi rah jaaegi
 After inspecting it and straightening it into the moon, the pedal should be tied up as necessary
 yah zanjeer choti choti pattinuma kadiyon, belanon or rivaton dwaara banaai jaati he
 It should be cleaned, greased with oil and mixed with its stretch and kept in good condition
 zanjeer ke rivatiy jodon ke deele hone tathaa belanon ke ghis jane se uski samgr lambaai bad jaaya karti he
 The pitch of the teeth of the pedal tread wheel does not change, so it hurts by descending from the chain wheel
 isaki pahichaan yah he ki patr par chadhi hui zanjeer ke sparshachaap ke bich main, use anguthe or tarjani se pakadakar baahar kii taraf khinchaa jaae
 If the chain is stretched only about an inch, then it is fine and if it is stretched by an inch, it must have slipped and loosened
 at: badal deni chahie
 The function of manual brakes that pressurize the wheels is based on the connection of the levers and poles
 bauden ke brake, ispaat kii lacheelee nalee main lage ek atampidya taar ke khinchaav par aadhaarit hote hai
 The segregation works to free the brakes
 brake, suraksha kaa pradhan upkaran he, at: brake ke danda susamanjit rahane chahie, arthath aise rahane chahie ki ve aron yaa tiron main na ataken
 The poles should be strong and easy to rotate on the joints
 dekhne main achche or purjein saaf suthere bhi rahane chahie

 Mukutiya estates, ie Crown Estate, are a set of specific land assets and achievements in the United Kingdom, owned by the sovereign, as their individual institution
 yah sampadaayen, naahin paryaapt rupase sarkari sampatti he, naa shaasha kii nijee sanvatti he
 Because all these are the assets of the ruler, but they are managed and administered by semi-independent publicly acquired bodies, and the sovereign has no privately minimal or minimal control or participation in their management
 atah inhen "samprabhu kii saarvajanik sampatti" kaha ja saktaa he
 The assets of the Mukutia estates are managed by the guardian of a Crown Estate Commissioner, who is competent to exercise "ownership rights" to that particular property
 in viraasati sampattiyon dwaara utpann rajasav ko shaasha dwaara unki shahi shaan kii sarkaar ke adhikaar main rakhaa gaya he
 Hence, all the revenue generated from them goes directly to the government fund
 crown estate, aadhikarik taur par, sansad ke prati uttardeh he
 Mukutia Properties is one of the uk's largest owners of properties, and has a net worth of £ 12bn, of which 9
1bn is for urban properties, and another £ 1
6bn for rural assets

 At present, the amount of money received from Mukutia Estates is more than that given to the Civil List or other grants to the Adhrat
 is prakaar 2007-08 ke bich crown esteton ne rajkosh main £200 million kii vruddhi karwaai, jabaki sansad dwaara 40 lakh pound kaa bhugtan kiya gaya tha
 Thus, with a wealth of 7
3 billion pounds, crown assets are one of the largest landowners in Britain, these sari assets are placed under trust and the sovereign cannot deal with them voluntarily

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga shastron or puraanon ke anusaar jeev kaa janm or maran ke bandhan se chhot janaa hi moksh he
 It has been said in Indian philosophies that a creature is born and dies again and again due to ignorance
 is janmamaran ke bandhan se chhot jane kaa hi naam moksh he 
 When man attains salvation, then he does not need to be born in this world
 shaastrakaron ne jivan ke chaar uddeshy batalaaye hai—dharm, arth, kaam or moksh 
 Out of these, Moksha has been called Param Abhisht or 'param Purushartha'
 moksh kii prapti kaa upaay aatmatatv yaa brahmatatv kaa saakshaat karnaa batalaaya gaya he 
 According to the judiciary, the ultimate destruction of sorrow is liberation or salvation
 sankhya ke mat se teenon prakaar ke tapon kaa samul naash hi mukti yaa moksh he 
 In Vedanta, attaining realization of your pure Brahmo form by devoid of myasambhana by complete enlightenment is salvation
 taatpary yah he ki sab prakaar ke sukh dukh or moh aadi kaa chhot janaa hi moksh he 
 The idea of salvation is behind the imagination of heaven, hell etc
 and is special Sanskrit and refined instead
 swarg kii kalpana main yah aavashyak he ki manushya apane kiye hue punya vaa shubh karm kaa fal bhogane ke uparant phir is sansar main aakaar janm le; isse use phir anek prakaar ke ksht bhogane padenge 
 But this is not the case in the imagination of salvation
 moksh mil jane par jeev sadaa ke liye sab prakaar ke bandhanon or kashton aadi se chhot jaataa he 
 In Indian philosophy, impermanence is considered the cause of sorrow
 sansar avaagaman, janm-maran or nashvarata kaa centre hai
 Salvation is liberation from this unvarnished prapancha
 praaia: sabhi darshanik pranaaliyon ne sansar ke du:kha may swabhaav ko sweekaar kiya he or isse mukt hone ke liye karmmarg yaa gyanmarg kaa rasta apanaaya he
 Moksha is the ultimate culmination of such a life
 ise parpaarthik mulya maanakar jivan ke param uddeshy ke rup main sweekaar kiya gaya he
 It is difficult to accept salvation as a matter of truth
 falat: sabhi pranaaliyon main moksh kii kalpana praaia: aatmavaadi he
 Ultimately, this can be proved to be an individual feeling
 yadhyapi vibhinn pranaaliyon ne apni-apni gyanamimasaa ke anusaar moksh kii alag alag kalpana kii he, tathaapi agyaan, du:kha se mukt ho saktaa he
 This will be called liberation of life
 kintu kuch pranaliyaan, jinamein nyaay, vaisheshik evam vishishtadvait ullekhneey hai; jeevanmukti kii sambhaavna ko asweekaar karte hai
 The second form is called "videhamukti"
 jiske sukh-du:kha ke bhaavon kaa vinaash ho gaya ho, vah deh tyaagane ke baad avaagaman ke chakra se sarvada ke liye mukt ho jaataa he
 He has to follow the path of negativity
 upanishdon main anand kii sthiti ko hi moksh kii sthiti kaha gaya he, kyonki anand main saare dwandvon kaa vilay ho jaataa he
 This is the state of monotheism

 In Vedanta, Mumukshu has to perform three types of mental activities like Shravan, Manana and Nidhidhyasana
 is prakriya main nanaatv, kaa, jo avidhyakrit he, vinaash hota he or aatma, jo brahmaswaroop he, uskaa saakshaatkaar hota he
 Mumukshu moves from "tattvamsi" to "ahmbrahyasmi"
 yahan aatmasaakshaatkaar ko ho moksh mana gaya he
 This situation in Vedanta is a state of liberation
 mrityuparaant vah brahm main villin ho jaataa he
 Salvation is the relation of God in theism
 anya duusare vaadon main sansar se mukti hi moksh he
 Moksha is denied in Lokayat
 buddha darshan main nirvana kii kalpana moksh ke samanaantar hi kii gai he
 The word "nirvana" means to extinguish
 nirvana shabd kii is vyutpatti ke mul arth ko lekar aalochakon ne nirvana ke siddhanth ko nirarthak bana diya he
 He believes that nirvana means the extinguishing of all human emotions, which is like death
 is prakaar ke arth dwaara nirvana ke siddhant kaa uphaas banane kii koshish kii he
 Secondly, critics have also forgotten to distinguish 'nirvana' and 'parinirvan'
 "jab sharir ke mahabhoot bikhar jate hai, sabhi sangyaayen ruk jaati hai, sabhi vednaaon kaa naash ho jaataa he, sabhi prakaar kii pratikraya band ho jaati he or chetana jaati rahati he, parinirvana kehalaata he
 Nirvana can never have this meaning
 nirvana kaa arth he apni bhaawanaaon par paryaapt sanyam rakhana, jisase aadmi dharm ke maarg par chalane ke yogya ban sake
 The Tathagata Buddha made it clear that Nirvana is the other name for good life
 nirvana kaa arth he vaasanaon se mukti
 Achieving Nirvana leads to a virtuous life
 jivan kaa lakshya nirvana hi he
 Nirvana is the goal
 nirvana madhyam maarg he
 Nirvana is nothing but the octagonal path
 buddha darshan main bhi bandhan kaa kaaran trishna, vitrushna tathaa avidya ko mana gaya he
 When a man is freed from these shackles, he goes to attain nirvana and opens the nirvana path for him
 iske liye ashtangik maarg kii vyavastha kii gai he
 They are as follows: samyag vision, samyag sankalpa, samyag vyaka, samyag karma, samyag jeevika, samyag striving, samyag smriti and samyag samadhi
 inamen se pratham do gyaan, madhya ke teen sheel evam antim teen samadhi ke antargat aate hai
 Following this path, Trishna is prevented, Trishna's detention prevents the collection trend
 is prakaar kii mukti jivan main bhi sambhav he, kintu mrityuparaant nirvana kaa kya swaroop hoga, ise nishedhaatmak rup se batalaaya gaya he
 In a way, he is similar to Shalnay
 jain darshan main jeev or ajeev kaa sabandh karm ke madhyam se sthapit hota he
 It is the bondage to bind an organism to a living being through karma
 is prakriya kaa aasrav shabd se vyakt karte hai
 The organism can be free from indigestion only when the discharge is stopped
 iske liye trividh sanyam kii vyavastha kii gai he
 Salvation is attained by following Samyag philosophy, Samyog wisdom and Samyag character
 in "triratnon" ke paalan se aasrav niruddh hota he
 There are two conditions in order to be free
 pehle naveen karmon kaa pravaah niruddh hota he, ise "sanvar" kehete hai
 In a distance state, the accumulated deeds of previous lives are also destroyed
 ise "nirjara" kehete hai
 The condition after this is called Moksha
 yah jeevanmukti kii sthiti he, lekin videhamukti ke baad jain kisi ishwar yaa brahm kii satta ko sweekaar nahin karte
 Nevertheless, it is clearly considered to be a transcendental form
 videhamukti kii avasthaa main "ke val gyaan" kii uplabdhi ho jaati he
 In such a situation, the soul is all round
 anant gyaan, anant shanti evam anant aishwarya use sahaj hi praapt ho jate hai
 Justice envisages salvation differently
 ve moksh kii sthiti ko aanandamay nahin maanate
 Because both sorrow and happiness are special qualities of the soul, therefore both are true
 nyaay vaisheshik abhaav ko bhi ek padaarth maanate hai
 That is why both are true
 nyaay vaisheshik abhaav ko bhi ek padaarth maanate hai
 That is why lack of sorrow does not mean enjoyment
 mukti kaa arth he "apvarg", du:kha sukh donon se pare hona
 These two are not the fundamental qualities of the soul
 isaliye moksh kii sthiti main aatma donon se mukt ho jaati he
 Before we can get rid of sorrow, we should give up hope of happiness
 kyonki du:kha ant tak hamaara peechha nahin chodta, lekin ham uskaa atikaraman kar sakate hai
 This state of happiness comes from being beyond sorrow
 aisa vyakti dehtyag ke pashchaat videhamukti ko praapt kar letaa he
 At this stage the soul goes beyond its special qualities
 ek tarah se vah samvedanheen or ichhashoonya ho jaataa he usamen pun: chaitanya pravisht hoga hi nahin
 Jeevanmukti is rejected in this sect
 phir vah achche karmo kaa sampadan karte hue, "divya vibhuti" pad ko praapt kar saktaa he
 But the special qualities of the soul will remain
 isamen bhi yoga, dhyaan or kramik abhyaas ke kathor sanyamon kaa paalan karnaa padataa he
 "kaivalya" has been considered the ultimate goal of life in Sankhya Yoga
 yah moksh ke samaan hi he
 The nature from which it is liberated, the nature from which it is liberated, and the one who is liberated, is dissatisfied with the male form
 kaivalya uskaa swabhaav he
 He forgets his nature when he comes in contact with nature
 vah ahmabuddhi ke aa jane par sansar ko satya maan letaa he
 To generate detachment towards the world, Mumukhas have to follow strict tenacity, rules and restraint
 is kathor sadhana ke aath ang hai, yama, niyam, asana, pranayam, pratyaahaar, dharna, dhyaan or samadhi
 Through this practice, and one is freed from egoism
 yahan mukt hone kaa arth kisi anya satta, ishwar yaa brahm se sanyog nahin he, balki moksh yahan viyog kii sthiti he
 Freed from instinct, the man attaining supreme peace achieves his failure
 is avasthaa main sadhak jivan mukt ho jaataa he
 Realizing his differences with nature, he will not be affected by disease malice etc
 deh tyaagane ke baad vah videh mukt ho jayega
 The evening does not believe in God, but Yoga also considers God providence or devotion as the means of salvation
 kintu yah shraddhalu athwa agyaniyon ke liye sweekrut kiya gaya he, jo kathor yogaagon kaa abhyaas karne main aksham hai
 Karma has been given the highest importance in Purvimamsa
 islaye jivan main du:kha se mukti or sukh kii prapti kii ichha karanevaala dharmik karm kare
 Performing this religious act, yajna, donation, etc
, leads to the attainment of Swargadi
 ek tarah se moksh kar isse koi sambandh nahin he
 In Advaita Vedanta, salvation is conceived on the basis of the Upanishads
 vedant main karm athwa bhakthi kii pradhanta na dekar gyaan ko pradhanta di gai he
 Although Mumukshu has to follow certain disciplines
 iske ananthar advaitavaadi shiksha par dhyaan ekagra kiya jaataa he
 The soul is considered to be Brahma Swaroop
 "aham brahmasmi" kaa gyaan hona hota he
 This is salvation
 tab aatma sat, chit, anand se purna ho jaataa he
 Acharya Shankar is the principal lecturer of this theory
 vishishtadvait main gyaan kii apeksha bhakthi ko pradhan mana gaya he
 Through devotion, the attainment of Narayana is attained
 narayan ke sangrakshan main hi purnamukthi or anand kii prapti hoti he
 This connection can be achieved by two means
 kramash: ise bhakthi or prapatti kehete hai
 Pratapati means surrendering with full faith in the grace of God
 isse sahaj hi moksh laabh hota he
 Ramanuja has also given secondary importance to Karmayoga and Jnana Yoga under devotion
 bhaktiyog main ishwar kaa nirantar chintan anivaary batalaaya gaya he
 This form of contemplation can also be romantic
 kintu iske madhyam se mumukshu ishwar kii ore unmukh hota he, use ishwar kii pratyakshanubhuti nahin hoti
 That is why Ramanuja does not believe in liberation of life
 vah to videhamukti ke baad narayan ke lok main hi sambhav he
 Salvation is possible as a result of Ishvarkripa only through prati and devotion
 madhwacharya bhi moksh ke liye bhakthi ko saadhan maanate hai
 Due to this devotion, the living being receives the Prasad of God and attains salvation

 There is an anecdote behind it that Daksha Prajapati performed a yagya called 'brihaspati Sarva' in Kankhal
 us yajna main brahma, vishnu, indra or anya devi-devataaon ko aamantrit kiya gaya, lekin jaan-boojhkar apane jamaata bhagwaan shankar ko nahin bulaayaa
 Shankaraji's wife and Daksha's daughter Sati went to participate in the yagna when the father was not invited and even after Shankarji stopped
 yajna-sthal par sati ne apane pita daksh se shankar ji ko aamantrit na karne kaa kaaran poocha or pita se ugr virodh prakat kiya
 On this Daksha Prajapati uttered abuses to Lord Shankar
 is apmaan se peedit hui sati ne yajna-agni kunda main kudakar apni pranahuti de di
 When Lord Shankar came to know of this accident, his third eye opened with anger
 bhagwaan shankar ke aadesh par unke ganon ke ugr coup se bhaybheet saare devtaa rishigan yajyasthal se bhaag gayi
 Lord Shankar took out the body of Sati from the Yajnakund and lifted it on the shoulder and started to roam around in grief

 jaise ham sab ko pataa he ki maut ki duniya me mrit logo ki atmaaen hoti he lekin iske pare is maut ki duniya me rakshas or aadhyatmik sanstha kaa saaya bhi hota he
 When people die, their soul is not uplifted or vice versa
 jaise ki agar koi insaan ek aisi maut mara he jisamen usko bahut taklif hui ho yaa phir be maut maaraa gaya ho to is ke kaaran us insaan kaa aatma us jagah par hi rah jaati he or aasaani se us aatma kaa uddhar nahi hota, koi aise sthaan bhi hote he jidhar se mrit logo ki aatma udhdaar hota hai, yah jagah koi ghanaa jangal me hota he yato phir koi sunsaan jagah main

 According to Roman Catholic belief, exorcism is a ritual, not a sacrament, unlike baptism or confession
 Unlike the sacrament, the "integrity and effectiveness of exorcism do not depend on any unchanging formula or systematic order of actions stated

 This practice was continued by the Apostle with power and in the name of Jesus
 anek tarkon par aadhaarit jisamen vah bhi shaamil he ki kisi vyakti ko, jise ek aastik ke rup main yishu messiah ne paap se mukt kar diya, vah phir se apane jivan main paap se grast ho saktaa he isliye vah pun: apane jivan main buree aatma ke chapet main aa saktaa he“ isai dharm ke kuch sampradaayon ke vipareet, luutherwaad yah pushti karata he ki aastik or naastik donon prakaar ke vyakti ko bhuton dwaara sataaya ja saktaa he
 After the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther abbreviated the Roman rituals used for exorcism
 1526 main, anushthan ko pun: sankshipt kiya gaya

 luutherwaadi carch kii dharm pustika ke anusaar These religious rules warn that often the state of ecstasy, epileptic seizures, laziness, insanity, and mania are the result of natural causes and should not be mistaken to understand ghosts
 luutherwaadi carch ke anusaar bhoot-pret ke apasaaran kii aavashyaktaa vaali bhoot-baadha ko ingit karne vaale lakshanon main shaamil he: The following symptoms have been listed by the Church as a secondary symptom - terrible screams, blasphemy of God, ridicule of neighbors, distortion in activities 9:20; Luck
 8: 26f), inhuman fun, physical torture, abnormal injuries on one's own body and the surrounding people, abnormal movements of the body, and obliteration of the work done
 duusare lakshanon main shaamil hai manushya kii taarkikta main vikruti jo use jaanavar bana detaa he, vishnnata, mrityu kaa gativardhan, tathaa anya atiprakritik ghatnaayen
 Once these are determined, the church is advised by an experienced physician to determine whether there is any medical interpretation of the person's behavior
 jab sahi myne main koi bhoot-baadha pahachaani jaati he, to peedit vyakti ko carch ke purohit kii dekhbhaal main rakhaa jaataa he, jo uchit dharm-siddhant kii shiksha detaa he, nishkalank jivan jeene vaala hota he, jo tuchh aarthik laabh ke liye kuch nahin karata kintu sab kuch aatma se karata he
 Then the priest has to diligently examine what kind of life the ghost-hounded person had lived till now and then the person is motivated to confess his sins through the law
 yah sab ho jane ke baad bhartsana athwa santvanaa dene kaa kaary hota he, prakritik chikitsak ke karyon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he, jo uchit prakaar kii dawa ke saath hanikaarak dravon dwaara bhoot-baadha se grast vyakti kii safai karegaa
 The Dharma booklet then states: methodist carch ke anusaar bhoot-pret ke apasaaran ke anushthan main shaamil he “dushtatma kii vastunishth shakti ko dur karnaa jisane kisi vyakti par adhikaar kar liya ho”
 iske atirikt, methodist carch bataata he ki “bhoot-apasaaran kaa adhikaar us rup main carch ko diya gaya jisamen isamsih kii ministry sansar main kaayam he”
 abhishikt padri ko bhoot-pret ke apasaaran kii kriya sampann karne ke kram main sabase pehle jila adheekshak se sampark karnaa chahie
 It is the belief of the Methodist Church that it is most important that the person seeking help be assured that the presence and love of Jesus is definitely available to him
 iske alaava “bible, prarthana tathaa sanskaar" kii ministry kaa vistaar in vyaktiyon tak bhi hona chahie
 The combination of these things has proved to be effective
 udhaaharan ke liye ek khaas paristhiti main, ek roman catholic mahila kaa yah vishwaas tha ki uskaa ghar bhutaha he or isliye usne apane padri se madad ke liye sampark kiya
 Because he was not available to drive away the ghosts from the woman's house, the woman approached a Methodist priest who expelled evil spirits from a room, which was considered the source of the ongoing crisis in the house and the Holy Communion at the same place Was organized; After this action there was no problem at home again
