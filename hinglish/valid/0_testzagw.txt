 In 1819, he wrote a famous book called Sadratnamala
 carbonic rasayan main prarambh se hi us vidhi ko jisamen yogic padaarth ke do yaa adhik anu milakar ek doosraa aisa anu yaa bahulak banaaen jiskaa pratishat sanghathan vahi ho jo mul padaarth ekalak kaa tha, tathaa uskaa anubhaar ekalak ke anubhaar kaa bahugun ho, bahulkikaran kehete hai
 Additive polymerization occurs only when heated or kept in an organic compound with several double or triple strands
 is prakriya dwaara mul vashpashil padaarth kam vashpashil drav yaa thos ke rup main badale ja sakate hai
 Some polymers have only two or three molecules of a monomer, but most of them have very large numbers
 kuch ekalak ek se adhik prakaar ke bahulak banaate hai tathaa kuch bahulak garam karne par ekalakon main parivartit ho jate hai
 Polymerization of ethylene and its derivatives is an example of additive polymerization and holds great technical significance
 ethilin ek gas he par iske anek anuon ke sanyukt hone se poliethlin naamak bahulak praapt hota he, jo ek bahut hi upyogi padaarth he
 Similarly styrene is a colorless intense smelling liquid
 kuch din rakhane yaa 100 degree sein

 First a concentrated fluid is obtained and finally a clean odorless, shiny, solid substance, called polystyrene
 ise sutara dwaara pradarshit kar sakate hai, jahaan par n kii sankhya hajaaron main he
 There are some substances in whose presence the polymerization process is completed in only a few minutes
 aise padaarthon ko prarambhk kehete hai
 In this way, polystyrene can be obtained within a few minutes by adding less than one percent benzyl peroxide to the polymerization of styrene
 is prakaar kii abhikriyaayein shrunkhlaa abhikriyaayon dwaara sampann hoti hai or inamen mukt mulak, jo prarambhk ke vighatan se banate hai, kriya ko puraa karte hai
 Thus if the initiator is made free of disintegration, it forms a large molecule by adding a binary bond, which also has independent bonds
 yah kriya phir aage chalati he or anu kaa aakaar kramshah badhata jaataa he
 If the polymerization of two singles is done together, both monomers of the polymer can also have both singles present

 Most polymers obtained from the polymerization industry are covalent
 isoprin, isobutylin, mathilamethacrillate, vinil chloride, vinil isitate, aikailo nitril aadi ekalak, anek prakaar ke kapade, rabar aadi banane main kaam aate hai
 High molecular weight polymers are also formed by the condensation polymerization method, which also produces water, or other ordinary molecules

 dardi bhashaayen uttari pakistan, uttar-purvi afghanistan or bharat ke jammu-kashmir rajya main boli jaatin hai
 Among all the Dardi languages, the status of Kashmiri is the highest because it has its own popular literature and also has the honor of being an official language of India
 pakistan ke chitral zile kii khovaar bhashaa, uttari kashmir main boli jane vaali shina bhashaa or afghanistan ke purvi nuristaan, nangarhaar or kunar rajyon main boli jane vaali pashai bhashaa anya mashhoor dardi bhashaayen hai
 There are no two opinions that Sanskrit, Persian, Punjabi, hindi-urdu etc
 have influence on almost all Dardi languages and many of their words are used in Dardi languages
 lekin bahut bhashavaigyanikon kaa maananaa he ke dardi bhashaaon ne bhi gair-dardi hindi-arya bhashaaon par apni chhap chodi he
 It is believed that some dialects of Punjabi, Uttarakhand and some other languages have an influence on Dardi
 haalanki is par vivaad jari he, lekin ek dharna yah bhi he ki pracheen kaal main dardi ek bahut bade kshetra main boli jaati thi jo sindhu nadi ke ird-gird or phir himachal or uttarakhand main failaa hua tha
 There are some special things in Dardi languages that make their identity in the entire indo-aryan language family, such that mahapraan consonants are pronounced like hypnotic consonants
 zyaadaatar hid-arya bhashaaon main mahapraan vyanjanon ko vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he, jaise kii mahapraan vyanjan 'kha' ko munh se vaayu-pravaah se bolaa jaataa he jabaki uske milte hue alpapraan vyanjan 'k' ko bahut kam vaayu-pravaah ke saath bolaa jaataa he
 This is not the case in Dardic languages
 in bhashaaon main vaayu-pravaah kii bajaay sur badal ke alpapraan or mahapraan vyanjanon main antar kiya jaataa he
 For example, where the word 'bhoomi' is in Sanskrit, there is 'buum' in the Khovar language, in which the voice goes from thick voice to thin tone
 isi tarah se jahaan hindi main mahapraani 'dha' se 'dhuaan' hota he vahaan pashai main alpapraani 'da' se 'duum' hota he
 In Kashmiri there is 'dod' instead of 'milk' in Sanskrit and 'milk' in Hindi
 pashchimi pahari ore punjabi main bhi isi tarah mahapraan ke sthaan par swar-badlaav dekhne ko miltaa he, jaise kii punjabi main hindi ke 'ghar' kii jagah swar badalata hua shabd 'kar' hota he
 Dardi languages often have syllable shifting, in which a vowel around the letter 'r' of the same word changes its place
 yah dardi bhashaaon main prachinkaal se hota aa rahaa he or gandhar kshetra main samraat ashok ke jamaane kii shilaon main bhi yah dekha ja saktaa he, jo 269 ipu se 231 ipu main khadi kii gai thim
 One title of Emperor Ashoka was 'priyadarshi' - but 'priyadrashi' is often seen on these rocks because of the syllable shifting, 'drisha' of 'darsha' became
 isi tarah in shilaon par 'dharm' ke sthaan par 'dhram' miltaa he
 In modern times, the word 'long' in Sanskrit can be seen in the word 'drig' in Kalash languages
 palula bhashaa main sanskrit kaa 'durbal' badal kar 'druble' ban jaataa he or sanskrit kaa 'bhurj' badal kar 'barhuj' ban jaataa he
 The ‘poor’ of Sanskrit becomes ‘drolid’ of Kashmiri and ‘karma’ becomes ‘kram’ in Kashmiri
 dardi bhashaaon kii yah pravriti punjabi or pashchimi pahari bhashaaon main bhi kuch had tak dekhi ja sakati he
 In Persian, where the tree is called 'dukht', in Punjabi it becomes 'drakht'
 adhiktar hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he
 But in Dardic languages, verb words come in the middle of a sentence
 is maamle main dardi bhashaayen angrezi kii tarah hotin hai
 In the sentences written above, the verb is written in thick letters
 jaisaa kii spasht he, lagbhag sari hind-irani bhashaaon main kriya vaakya ke ant main aati he, lekin dardik is niyam ko bhang karti he or angrezi kii tarah kriya ko sangya ke baad daalati he
 Such languages that are inserted after the verb noun are called "verb second languages"
 chalivendal, hindoopuram mandal main bharat ke andhrapradesh rajya ke antargat ke anantpur jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Ogavara Lake is the eleventh largest lake in Japan and the largest in Omori Province

 jhil ogavara ke aasapaas ki tatarekha pragaitihaasik kaal ke baad se sthit he, or yahan se kai jomone kaal ke avshesh or meden ke khol kii khoj kii gai hai
 During the Second World War the lake was used by Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service units at Misawa Airfield to practice for an attack at Pearl Harbor, as the lake and Pearl Harbor's depths of Hawaii Bay have great similarities

 Ogavara Lake is a habitat for abundant fish and birds, and is thus recognized by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment
 jhil main swaabhaavik rup se vibhinn prakaar ke jali jeev-jantu rahete hai
 In 1996, the sound of wild birds on the banks of Lake Ogavara was chosen by the Ministry of Environment as one of the 100 best sounding sounds in Japan
 
 In the year 2002, the Ministry of the Environment classified Lake Ogavara as one of the 500 important aquatic areas of Japan, particularly the habitat of migratory wildflowers for aquatic vegetation, insects, freshwater shells and biological diversity
 jhil, gambhir rup se luptpraaya hucho peri kaa ghar tha, jo 1943 main aakhri baar dekha gaya tha
 The birds coming from outside also include Jofford Swan and Tundra Swan

 a business is a legally recognized institution created with the goal of providing a product or service to consumers
 vyavsaay ko 'company', 'interprise' yaa 'form' bhi kehete hai
 Business has a prominent place in the capitalist economies which are mostly in private hands and work with the aim of making profit and at the same time increase the business itself
 kintu sahakaari sansthaayen tathaa sarkaar dwaara chalaayi jaani vaali sansthaaen praaia: laabh ke bajaay anya uddeshyon kii purti ke liye banaayi gayi hoti hai
 We live in a commercial environment
 yah samaaj kaa ek anivaary ang he
 It fulfills our needs by providing a wide variety of goods and services through a wide network of business functions
 anya shabd - vyapaar, vyavsaay-pratishthan, form, dhandha, vyavsaay, karbar, kaarobaar, kaam-kaaj, kaam-dhandha, udhyam When we pay attention to our surroundings, we see that most people are engaged in some work
 adhyaaapak vidyalayon main padhaate hai, kisaan kheton main kaam karte hai, majdoor kaarkaanon main kaam karte hai, chaalak gaadiyaan chalaate hai, dukandaar saamaan bechate hai, chikitsak rogiyon ko dekhte hai aadi
 In this way every man is busy with some work all day, or sometimes overnight
 lekin ab prashn yah uthta he ki ham sab is tarah kisi na kisi kaam main apane aapako itnaa vyast kyon rakhte hai? iskaa sirf ek hi uttar he - 'apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye'
 By working in this way, we either fulfill our various responsibilities or earn money, so that we can buy the goods and services we need
 manushya dwaara kii jane vaali vibhinn kriyaayein maanviya kriyaayein kehalaati hai
 We can divide all these actions into two categories - jo kriyaayein dhan arjeet karne ke uddeshy se kii jaati hai, unhen aarthik kriyaayein kehete hai
 For example, the farmer grows the crop by plowing the field and earns money by selling it, the factory or office worker receives salary or wages in exchange for his work, the merchant earns profit from the sale and purchase of goods
 ye sabhi kriyaayein aarthik hai
 Activities that are performed for the purpose of achieving satisfaction, rather than earning money, are called uneconomical actions
 is tarah kii kriyaayein, saamaajik uttardayitvon kii purti, manoranjan yaa swasthya laabh ke liye kii jaati hai
 People visit places of worship, donate to a flood or earthquake relief fund, engage themselves in sports for health benefits, do gardening, listen to radio, watch television or perform other activities
 ye kuch udhaaharan anaarthik kriyaaon ke hai
 Economic activities are usually carried out for the purpose of earning money
 sadhrantaya log is tarah kii kriyaaon main niyamit rup main sanlagn hote hai, jise aarthik kriya kaha jaataa he
 Business can be defined as: vyavsaay kii nimnlikhit visheshtaayen hoti hai : The cultural heritage of India is very rich
 lekin shaayad yah bahut kam log jaanate honge ki pracheen kaal main bharat, arthvyavastha tathaa vyavsaay ke str par bahut hi viksit desh tha
 This is evident from historical evidence, evidence from excavations, literature and written documents
 in sabase adhki bharat kii aseem dhan sampatti se aakarshith hokar vibhinn videshi akramanakariyon dwaara samay-samay par hue akraman bhi is tathy ko pramanit karte hai
 Ancient Indian civilization was not only based on prosperity, but its internal and external trade and commerce were also very advanced
 vyavsaayik jagat ke vibhinn kshetron main bharat kaa aseem yogadan he
 On comparing it with the occupations prevailing in other countries of the time, we find that Indian business was far ahead in its singularity, mobility (dynamic) and quality
 shuru ke dinon main bhartiya arthvyavastha purnatah krishi adhrith thi
 People used to produce their consumption items themselves
 vastuon ko bechney athwa vinimay kii aavashyaktaa hi nahin thi
 But with the development, the needs of the people started increasing
 jiske kaaran vastuon ke utpaadan main bhi vrudhi hone lagi
 People began to specialize in the production of various items of daily use and luxury, and thus they lacked the nature and scope of business and efficiency to produce other items of their use
 is prakaar inaki kushalta main vrudhi hone lagi or ye apni aavashyaktaa se adhki vastuon kaa utpaadan karne main sakasham ho gaye
 Hence, to meet their other requirements, a system of exchange of their overproduced goods developed
 yah vyapaar kii shuruuaat thi
 Today, most people believe that much development in the field of business and trade in India has taken place only after attaining independence
 bharat, aaj audyogic utpaadan main itnaa sakasham ho gaya he ki ham sabhi vastuon kaa utpaadan deshi takanic ke prayog se kar sakate hai
 But it should not be taken from this that Indian civilization was not developed or advanced in the past
 jabaki hamen aaj bhi bharat kii samrudhi vyapaarik va vanijyik dhrohar par garv he
 You will be surprised to know that India started its journey in the field of trade and commerce 5000 years BC
 Had started kai aitihaasik saakshyon se yah pramanit hota he ki us samay bharat main suniyojit shahar the
 There was a worldwide fascination for Indian clothing, jewelery and perfumes etc
 yah bhi pramaan mili hai ki kaaphi samay se bhartiya vyapaariyon main vyavsaay ke liye mudra ke prayog kaa chalan tha
 Unions were popularized to protect the interests of traders, craftsmen and producers
 yah bharat main vyapaar va vaanijya ke jatil vikaas kii ore sanket karata he
 The merchants of India at that time not only weaved a network of strong internal trade routes, but also had commercial connections with merchants from Arabia, Central and South East Asia
 bharat vibhinn prakaar kii datu saamagree ke utpaadan main bhi sakriy tha, jaise tamba, pital kii vasteen, bartan, gahane tathaa sajaavati saamaan aadi
 Indian traders exported their products to different parts of the world and imported their products from there
 yah ek sarvavidit tathy he ki angrej sarvapratham bharat main vyapaar karne ke liye hi aae the, jinhone baad main yahaan apana rajya sthapit kar liya
 India has contributed to world trade and commerce in many ways
 gananaa ke liye ank pranali, jiskaa ham aaj bhi upyog karte hai, bharat main pehle se viksit thi
 Joint family practice and division of labor in business also developed here, which is prevalent till date
 aaj aadhnik samay main prayog kii jane vaali upabhokta kendrit vyavsaay takanic puraane samay se bhartiya vyavsaay kaa ek abhinn ang rahi he
 Therefore we can say that India has its own rich commercial heritage, which has contributed significantly to its growth
 sabhi vyavsaayik kriyaayein kuch uddeshyon kii purti ke liye kii jaati hai
 Business objectives can be classified as follows: vyavsaay ke aarthik uddeshyon ke antargat laabh kamaane ke uddeshy ke saath ve samast aavashyak kriyaayein bhi aati hai, jinke dwaara laabh kamaane ke uddeshy kii purti kii jaati he, jaise graahak bananaa, niyamit nav pravartan tathaa uplabdh sansadhano kaa behatar upyog aadi
 Profit serves as the life force for business
 iske bina koi bhi vyavsaay pratiyogita ke bazaar main tikaa nahin rah saktaa
 In fact, the purpose of any business entity coming into existence is profit making
 laabh, vyavsaayee ko na keval uski aajeevika arjeet karne main sahaayta karata he, apitu laabh kaa ek bhaag vyavsaay main punah viniojit kar vyavsaayik gatividhyin ke vistaar main bhi sahaayak hota he
 Following are some other objectives of the business to achieve the primary objective of making profit: saamaajik uddeshy vyavsaay ke ve uddeshy hote hai, jinhen samaaj ke hiton ke liye praapt karnaa aavashyak hota he
 Therefore, the aim of every business should be to not harm the society in any way
 vyavsaay ke saamaajik uddeshyon ke antargat acchhee gunvattta vaali vastuon tathaa sevaaon kaa utpaadan tathaa purti, uchit vyapaarik prathaen apnaanaa, samaaj ke saamaanya kalyankari kaaryon main yogadan tathaa kalyankari suvidhaon main yogadan karnaa sammilit he
 Human purposes mean those objectives which have the goals of the welfare of the disabled and the disabled, deprived of education or training and fulfillment of the expectations of the employees
 is prakaar vyavsaay ke maanviya uddeshyon ke antargat karmchaariyon kii aarthik suraksha, saamaajik tathaa manovaigyanik santushti or maanav sansadhano kaa vikaas nihit he
 Business is an important part of the country, so the achievement of national goals and aspirations should be the objective of every business
 vyavsaay ke rashtriya uddeshy nimnlikhit hai: Earlier India had very limited trade relations with other countries
 tab vastuon kii aayaat or niryaat sambandhi nitiyaan bahut kathor thim, lekin aajkal udaaravaadi aarthik nitiyon ke kaaran kaaphi had tak videshi nivesh par pratibandh samaapt ho chukaa he, tathaa aaayaatit vastuon par lagane vaala shulk bhi kaaphi kam ho gaya he
 These changes have increased competition in the market
 aaj vaishvikaran ke kaaran puri duniya ek bade bazaar ke rup main parivartit ho chuki he
 Today, finished goods are easily available in one country
 is prakaar vishwa bazaar main pratispardhaa badhane se prayek vyavsaay apane mastishk main kuch uddeshy rakhkar kaam karne laga he, jise vaishvik uddeshy kaha ja saktaa he
 People run businesses with the aim of making a profit
 lekin keval laabh arjeet karnaa hi vyavsaay kaa ekmaatra uddeshy nahin hota
 Being a part of society, it also has to do a lot of social work
 yah vishesh rup se apane astitv kii suraksha main sanlagn swaamiyon, niveshkon, karmchaariyon tathaa saamaanya rup se samaaj vyavsaay kii prakruti tathaa kshetra va samudaay kii dekharekh kii jimmedaari bhi nibhaataa he
 Therefore, every business should bear responsibilities towards them in one way or the other
 udhaaharan ke liye, niveshkon ko uchit pratifal kii dar kaa aashwaasan dena, apane karmchaariyon ko acha vetan, suraksha, uchit kaary dashaayen uplabdh karana, apane graahakon ko acchhee gunvattta vaali vastuen uchit mulyon par ulabdh karana, paryaavaran kii suraksha karnaa tathaa isi prakaar ke anya bahut se kaary karne chahie
 While doing such work, two things should be specially taken care of for sustaining the social responsibilities of the business
 pehali to yah ki aisi prayek kriya rdhmarth kriya nahin hoti
 This means that if a business donates some money to a hospital or temple or a school or college, it will not be called its social responsibility, because donating does not discharge social responsibilities
 duusari baat yah he ki, is tarah kii kriyaayein kuch logon ke liye acchhee or kuch logon ke liye buree nahin honi chahie
 Suppose a businessman earns a lot of money by smuggling or shoving his customers and runs a hospital for free treatment of the poor, then his work is not socially justified
 saamaajik uttardaayitv kaa arth he ki ek vyavsaayee saamaajik kriyaaon ko sampann karte samay aisa kuch bhi na kare, jo samaaj ke liye hanikaarak ho
 Thus the concept of social responsibility encourages the businessman to earn profit through prudent management in lieu of unfair trade practices like hoarding and black marketing, tax evasion, adulteration, expulsion of customers
 yah karmchaariyon ko uchit kaary tathaa awasaiya suvidhen pradaan karke, graahakon ko utpaada vikray uparaant uchit sevaayen pradaan karke, paryaavaran pradooshan ko niyantrit karke tathaa prakritik sansadhanon kii suraksha dwaara sambhav he
 Having learned about the concept of social responsibility of the business and its importance, let us find out what the business has responsibilities towards its various interest groups on which it is dependent
 vyavsaay praayah swaamiyon, vinieveshkon, karmchaariyon, purtikartaaon, graahakon tathaa upabhoktaaon, pratiyogiyon, sarkaar tathaa samaaj par ashrith he
 These are called interest groups because the interests of these groups are directly or indirectly affected by each action of the business
 vyavsaay ke apane swaamiyon ke prati uttardaayitv hai : The business has responsibilities to its creditors: vyavsaay ke apane karmchaariyon ke prati nimnlikhit uttardaayitv hai : Following are the responsibilities of the business to its suppliers: graahakon ke prati vyavsaay ke uttardaayitv nimnlikhit hai : The business has the following responsibilities towards its competitors: sarkaar ke prati vyavsaay ke vibhinn uttardaayitv nimnlikhit hai : a society consists of individuals, groups, organizations, families etc
 ye sabhi samaaj ke sadsy hote hai
 All of them are similar with each other and depend on each other for almost all their activities
 in sabhi ke bich ek sambandh hota he, chaahe vah pratyaksh ho yaa apratyaksh
 Being a part of society, business should also help in maintaining relations between the members of the society
 iske liye use samaaj ke prati kuch nishchit uttardayitvon kaa nirvaah karnaa aavashyak he
 These responsibilities are as follows: vishwa hindi nyaas samiti kaa mukhyalay new yark main he

 iske antargat vishvavidhyalay ke maidan, bhawan, prabhag, tathaa vidhyaarthiyon kaa sanghathan aadi bhi sammilit hai
 In ancient times there were no universities in the recognized sense in the countries of Europe, although there were many important schools, such as the philosophical schools of Athens, or the schools of literature and customs of Rome, which were higher education institutions
 madhya yug main shiksha par dharmik sansthaaon kaa niyantran rahaa
 Religious institutions arranged schools in which clergy were taught religious, literary and scientific subjects

 Around 1250 AD, the word 'university' started being used in a new sense and instead of erudite students, the rulers started establishing political and social needs of their states

 The university came to be regarded as the institution for initiating workers for the state and related expenses

 Universities became centers of scientific discoveries in this century

 web fid ) prayogkartaaon ko nirantar navinikrut vishay vastuon ko uplabdh karaane hetu prayog kiya jane vaala data praaroop he
 Data feeds are provided through a content provider syndicate that users can subscribe to
 ek sthaan se web fid uplabdh karwaane ko agrigeshan kehete hai or aisa ek agrigater dwaara kiya jaataa he
 Web feeds are sometimes called syndicated feeds
 web fid ke upyog kaa ek vishisht paridrishy yah he ki ek saamagree pradaata apni sait par fid link detaa he jinhen prayogkarta agrigater program kii sahaayta se le sakate hai; aisa karnaa web brouzar se link ko agrigater par khinch le aane jitna saral hota he
 When instructed, the aggregator asks all the servers in its feed list if they have any new content, if so, the aggregator either makes a note of the new content or downloads it
 agrigater ko nai saamagree ko jaanchane ke liye samaybaddh kiya ja saktaa he
 Web feeds are an example of pull technology, although they appear to push content to users
 web fid dwaara pradutt saamagree vishesh rup se HTML hoti hai athwa ve web prishthon ke link yaa digital madhyamon ke anya prakaar ho sakate hai
 Usually when websites provide users with a web feed indicating the change of content, they only show a summary of the entire content instead
 kai web cites, web blogs, schools evam podcasters web fid uplabdh karavaate hai
 Compared to providing continuously variable content via email, web feeds have some advantages: web fid ke prayog ke liye fid reader kaa upyog karnaa hota he
 This tool works like an automated email program, but does not require an email address
 prayogkarta kisi vishesh web fid ko sabsakrib kar letaa he or uske baad usko parivartit saamagree har baar praapt hoti rahati he
 The feed reader can be online or offline
 haal hi main mobile phone par upyog kiye ja sakane vaale reader bhi bazaar main aa gaye hai
 An offline web feed is downloaded to the user's computer
 fid reader kaa prayog nijeekrut home pej, jaise igugle, maai yahuu, tathaa maai emesain par, mausam, puunji bazaar ke bhav aadi khabaron ko daalane ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he
 Feeds are also used to bring content from other sites to individual pages

 Some other web based tools are only for feed readings

 For example, feeddemon, netnewswire, Blogbridge and rssaul
 Some other email clients such as Outlook 2007 and Thunderbird also handle the feed
 opera, safari, firefox, internet explorer 7
0 tathaa kai anya brouzars live bukmarks, feverates tathaa anya kai takneekon se fid ko brouzars main samahit kar lete hai
 a web feed is usually made available by its creator
 saamanytah fid tathaa website ek hi jagah se aate hai
 However not all websites provide feeds
 Sometimes a third party can read the website and provide its feed by scraping
 scraping vivaadaaspad he kyonki yah saamagree ke swami dwaara na chune gaye prakaar se isko vitarit karata he
 a web feed is a document whose unconnected portion contains a web link to the source of the content
 yadhyapi samachar web cites tathaa blogs web fid ke saamaanya strot hai, tathaapi fid kaa prayog kisi bhi sanrachit soochna ke vitaran ke liye kiya jaataa he, jo ki mausam se lekar sheersh das gaanon ki suchi tathaa khoj ke parinaamon tak ho sakati he
 There are two main forms of web feeds: RSS and Atom
 soochna ke liye fid uplabdh karaaye jane kaa varnan karne vaale do mukhya shabd "fid kaa prakaashan" or "sindication" hai
 Syndicated web feed content can be shared and republished by other web sites just like a published newspaper
 kii lokapriy paribhaasha vastav main saral sindication he)
 The feed is subscribed to directly by users via aggregators or feed readers that display multiple web feeds on a screen or series of screens
 kuch aadhunik web brouzar main agrigater suvidha shaamil hoti he
 Users usually subscribe to the feed by manually entering the URL or clicking the link in the browser
 web fid manushyon dwaara padhane yogya na hokar mashiinon dwaara padhane yogya hoti hai, isi kaaran shuruyaat main web fid se log bhramit ho jate hai
 This means that web feeds can be used to automatically transfer information from one website to another without any human intervention
 shabd aar es es kaa prayog saadharantaya web fid athwa web sindication ko ingit karne main kiya jaataa he, haalanki sabhi web fid praaroop aar es es nahin hote hai
 As an example, Blogspace's description of using web feeds in aggregators mainly consists of the words "RSS Info" and "RSS Readers", although the inclusion of the Atom format in the first line would have made it clear
 Is that "rss and atom file provide news for your computer from any web site"
 saanchaa:podcasting Punitiveness The simple meaning of this word is - the obligation to get punishment for the "crime" committed
 aparaadh karanevaala vyakti saamanyat: apradhi kehalaata he arthath vah jo kanoon dwaara amaanya kaam kare athwa kanoon dwaara nirdhaarit anivaary kaam kii avhelnaa kare evam apane kaam yaa isaki avhelnaa se samaaj ko kshati pahunchaave
 Often a crime causes harm to a particular person and for this he can seek compensation in civil court, but in terms of social peace and discipline, there are many people for whom punishing the court by bringing criminal against the criminal
 Is the duty of samaaj main shanti kaayam rakhana shashan kaa hi daayitv he
 If every person takes vengeance for the crime committed against him by his opponent, then chaos will spread in the society and ultimately civilized life will be lost
 is kaaran rajya kii ore se hi aparaadhiyon ke viruddh gurutar dandabhiyog ke maamle laae jate hai evam aparaadh se saakshaat trast vyakti keval sakshi athwa nimitt maatr rah jaataa he
 The symbol of society is considered to be the one in which sovereign power is enshrined
 bhinn-bhinn deshon main aise sattadhari vyaktiyon ke bhinn bhinn naam hote hai
 Like, King in England, President in India
 dandabhiyog ke maamle main pratham paksh main inhen ke naam hote hai, yadhyapi aterni jeneral athwa director ov public prosecution bhi shashan kii ore se pratham paksh main ho sakate hai
 There is a fundamental difference in the cases of impeachment and title that the goal of the conviction is to punish the guilty, in the case of the plaintiff, the object of the plaintiff is to obtain property or to declare a personal right
 dandabhiyog ke liye bhinn bhinn rup main dand die ja sakate hai
 Such as, death, life-long deportation, imprisonment, protest, whipping, forfeiture, the coronation of the property of the offender, etc
 kabhi kabhi dand ke saath saath apradhi ko anarhata naagarik adhikaron kii haani evam raajnneetik adhikaron kaa apharan bhi sahanaa padataa he
 No one can be punished for an offense if he has not directly or indirectly done any work which is invalid by law or has not committed error in any mandatory work prescribed by law
 saadhaarant: kisi aparaadh kii purnataa ke liye yah aavashyak he ki vah doshapurn man se kiya jaay
 But only if the offender is voluntary can his work be considered a crime
 swechha se kiya hua kaam yaa kaam kii avhelnaa vah he, jise karne yaa na karne kii ichha rahi ho
 Therefore, if a person has committed a crime in an unconscious state, ie, on being sleepy, due to being in a very low state, inertia or insanity, it would be presumed that his brain was not working in such a situation
 falat: us kaam ke karne yaa uski avhelnaa main uski ichha nahin thi
 There is a difference between purpose and goal
 maamla chalaanevaala kisi dandabhiyog ke uddeshy par pramaan de saktaa he, yadhyapi aisa karne ko vah baadhya nahin he
 In cases where innocence of will may be introduced in defense, innocence of purpose is not defense
 kanoon se amaanya kaam kii marjana is aadhaar par nahin kii ja sakati ki vah achche uddeshy se kiya gaya he
 Therefore, where an indictment of publication of obscene subject has been brought and the publication is indeed obscene, it will not be accepted in defense of the accused that his motive was good
 angareji vidhaan main nishchaayak prakalpana he ki aath saal kii avasthaa se kam kaa shishu aparaadh nahin kar saktaa
 In Indian law it is limited to seven years
 yadi koi balak, jisaki avasthaa 8-14 saal ke bich he, koi aparaadh kare, jisamen dusht ichha aavashyak he, to kanoon kii prakalpana ke anusaar yah mana jaayga ki use yah samajhane kii kshamta nahin he ki vah aparaadh kar rahaa he
 Therefore, it will be a charge on the person conducting the case that the said child had the ability to understand the crime
 kanoon kii ek nishchaayak prakalpana he ki 14 saal se kam se balak ko sambhog kaa gyaan nahin hota
 Hence, he cannot be punished for an attack with the goal of raping
 is vishay par sakshya bhi nahin diya ja saktaa ki 14 saal se kam avasthaa kaa balak shaareerik vikaas ke kaaran sambhog kriya main sakasham he
 But if he helps a person above the age of 14 years in sexual intercourse, it will happen
 14 saal se kam avasthaa kaa koi balak kisi bhi sthiti main aprakritik aparaadh main sahyogi nahin mana jaayga
 Everyone above the age of 14 years has sufficient knowledge in terms of law
 at: vah apane aparaadh ke liye doshi mana jaayga
 Where it is certified that the person who committed the crime was unable to understand the fruits of the crime committed due to being in a bad mental state at the time of committing the crime, then he shall not be liable for the crime nor shall he be called the offender
 
 aparaadh karne ke samay koi vyakti veikshipt tha yaa nahin, yah tathy kaa vishay he, kanoon kaa nahin
 The accused is charged with insanity
 visheshgy kaa sakshya anivaary nahin he
 It is also not necessary to give evidence by the Witnesses of immunity
 maamla chalaane vaale ke sakshiyon kii pratipruchha se pramanbhaar kaa daayitv nibhaayaa ja saktaa he
 Merely saying that a crime was committed without purpose does not prove insanity
 aise maamalon main juri kii sanmati hoti he "apradhi kintu veikshipt" 
 The culprit is kept in jail for the duration of King Kinwa President's will
 apradhi doshasiddh yaa dandaspt nahin kaha ja saktaa
 Therefore, he does not have the right to appeal
 is prasang main naitik veikshiptata asambaddha he
 That is, if it is said that the criminality of the criminal was right at the time of the crime, but his moral thinking has been erased or he has committed the crime despite being possessed by the incompressible flow of the brain, then his crime will not be excusable
 saadhaarant: koi vyakti, jo swechha se nashe kaa seven kar matt ho jaataa he, aparaadh ke daayitv se mukt nahin ho saktaa, kyonki matt yaa matvaala vyakti bhi aparaadh ke lakshya ko samajhane kii kshamta rakhata he
 But when intoxication or prominence has reached the point that it has caused temporary insanity, the defense of the accused will be similar to the insanity caused by other reasons
 jis aparaadh main lakshya aavashyak he, vahaan madasakti par sakshya dekar anyaanya sakshya ke saath yah dekha ja saktaa he ki aparaadh main lakshya bana yaa nahin
 But the evidence of insanity is not generally applicable
 yadi koi vyakti shaareerik peedan kaa bhay dikhalaae jane par baadhya hokar kisi ke aadesh ke anusaar koi aparaadh kare, jo anyathaa swechha se kiye jane par dandabhiyog hota, to vah dandabhiyog ke daayitv se mukt he
 But the person who compels him to commit the crime is guilty
 par yah bachaav tabhi maanya ho saktaa he, jab praan jane kaa tatkshan bhay ho
 If a person commits a crime by being influenced by moral force, it will not be excusable
 yadi koi apane se upar ke adhikari kii ajna paalan karne ko baadhya he evam ukt adhikari kii ajna kaa paalan karte hue, koi aparaadh kar daalata he, to uskaa aparaadh kshamya nahin hoga, yadhyapi vidwesh kii bhaavana kaa abhiyog usapar nahin lagaaya ja saktaa
 The king cannot be punished because he is incapable of committing a crime in the eyes of the law
 bhinn bhinn rashtron ke bich parsparik sauhaard banaae rakhane ke abhipraay se ek desh ke raja yaa uske rajdoot par anyaay deshon main dandabhiyog ke maamle nahin laae ja sakate
 The members of the Parliament are within the rules of impeachment, but they cannot be accused for their speech given in the House

 We usually get confused between bit and binary digits, so the difference is as follows: The difference between binary digit and bit is that binary digit can only be 0 or 1 which is a number value but bit is so much space Which can store a binary digit
 yahi kaaran he ki 0 yaa 1 main se keval ek hi samay main ek hi bit main sangrahit kiya jayega jise ek bit kaha jayega
 a bit can have 0 or 1 at a given time
 data yatra kii gati kii maatra ke rup main bhi bit kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 It is used to determine how many bits of information are transferred per second
