 They consider it to be the product of a specific type of intergroup interaction, rather than considering ethnicity as an important trait inherent in a human group

 According to Thomas Hillland Eriksen, two different arguments dominated the study of ethnicity
 ek, "aadimavad" or "karnavaad" ke bich he
 In primitive terms, the participle assumes ethnic relations as a social bond, combined, externally provided, which may also be aggressive
 duusari ore karanvaadi drushtikon ke anusaar, jaateeyata mukhyatah ek raajnneetik ranneeti kaa ek tadarth tatv he, jise hit samoohon ke liye dhan, shakti yaa ohade main vruddhi jaise duusare darje ke lakshyon ko praapt karne ke liye sansaadhan ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he
 This debate is still used as an important reference in political science, although the views of most scholars remain between the two poles
 duusari bahes "rachnawad" or "tathvikwaad" ke bich he
 Constructivists often refer to national and ethnic identities as recent historical forces, even when identities are presented as archaic
 tathvikwaadi is tarah ke parichay ko saamaajik karrwai ke parinaam ke bajaay, saamaajik kartaaon ko paribhaashit karne vaale sattamulak shreniyon ke rup main dekhte hai
 According to Eriksen, these debates were sidelined, particularly by the efforts of scholars in anthropology to respond to the increasingly politicized forms of self-leadership by members of various ethnic groups and nations

 The modern use of the term is relatively new — the term ethnic group was first used in 1851 - 1935 and entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 1972
 oxford english dictionari kii aadhunik upyog sambandhi paribhaasha is prakaar he: a n Writing about the use of the English word "ethnic" in the common language of Great Britain and the United States, Wallman comments that is prakaar vartmaan bolchaal kii bhashaa main, aaj bhi "ethnic" or "ethnicity" shabd ke chaaron ore videshi logon, alpsankhyak muddon or jaateey sambandhon kaa ek gheraa bana hua he
 However, in the realm of social sciences, it is commonly used for all human groups who explicitly consider themselves culturally distinct and also perceived by others
 "ethnic group" shabd ko saamaajik vigyaan main laane vaale pratham vyaktiyon main german samajashastri maiks webar bhi shaamil hai, jo ise is rup main paribhaashit karte hai: Human groups who consider the subjective notion of their common origins to be due to the same physical structure or customs or both, or because of memories of colonization and migration; This assumption should be important for group formation; Furthermore, it does not matter whether a specific blood relationship exists

 Secondly, this belief in the shared gemineshaft did not create the group, but the group built the trust

 Barth also surpassed Weber in emphasizing the construction of the nature of ethnicity
 barth ke liye, donon bahya aropan or aantarik aatm-pahchaan ke dwaara nirantar rup se vaarta or punarvaata hi jaateeyata thi
 In Barth's opinion, ethnic group hierarchies are not disjunctive cultural solitude or logical a priori to which people naturally belong

 Therefore, the focus on mutual affiliation of ethnic identity is "ethnic groups and boundaries"
 barth likhte hai: " nirnayaatmak jaateey bhed gatishiltaa, sampark or jaankaree ke abhaav par nirbhar nahin he, lekin isamen apvarjan or samavesh kii saamaajik prakriyaayein shaamil hai jisase vyaktigat jivan itihaas ke dauraan unki sahabhaagita or sadsyta main badlaav ke baavjood, asatat shreniyon ko barkaraar rakhaa jaataa he

 One day she was taking a bath in a pond filled with lotus flowers in the summer night
 uski sundarataa dekhakar bhagwaan chandra un par mohit ho gaye
 He came to earth in human form and killed Hemavati
 durbhaagya se hemavathi vidhwaa thi
 She was the mother of a child
 unhone chandradev par apana jivan nasht karne or charitra hanan kaa aarope lagaaya
 To repent of her mistake, Chandra Dev promised Hemvati that she would become the mother of a brave son
 chandradev ne kaha ki vah apane putr ko khajurpura le jaae
 He said that he would become a great king
 raja banane par vah baag or jhiilon se ghire hue anek mandiron kaa nirmaan karavaayega
 Chandradev told Hemavati that on becoming king your son will conduct a huge yagna which will wash away all your sins
 chandra ke nirdeshon kaa paalan kar hemavathi ne putr ko janm dene ke liye apana ghar chhod diya or ek chote-se gaanv main putr ko janm diya
 Hemavati's son Chandravarman was as stunning, brave and powerful as his father
 solah saal kii umr main vah bina hathiyaar ke sher yaa baagh ko maar saktaa tha
 Seeing the extraordinary valor of the son, Hemavati worshiped Chandradeva, who presented a stone of paras to Chandravarman and made him king of Khajuraho
 paras pathar se lohe ko sone main badla ja saktaa tha
 Chandravarman won a spectacular victory in many successive wars
 usne kalinger kaa vishaal kila banwaaya
 At the behest of her mother, Chandravarman built 85 unique temples in Khajuraho, covered with ponds and gardens, and conducted a yagna that freed Hemavati from sin

 lekin 2006 main is ghatana se bachakar nikle ek yatri maaikel thexton ne ek pustak prakashit kii jisamen unhone daawa kiya ki unhone hijacrs ko baat karte hue suna tha ki ve jahaaj ko israel main kisi nirdhaarit nishane par krash karana chaahate the 
 During this hijack, 20 passengers were killed, of which 12 were Indians and the rest were from America, Pakistan and Mexico
 sabhi aparankartaaon ko giraftaar kar liya gaya or mrityudand diya gaya
 However, his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment which was opposed by India and America
 yah ghatana tab shuru hui jab karachi main yatriyon ne francfort ja rahe is vimaan par chadhana shuru kiya
 a subsequent FBI investigation revealed that the presence of armed guards around the aircraft could not avert the hijacking
 chaaron aparankarta karachi airport suraksha guard ke bhesh main the tathaa asolt rifles, grenads, pistolo va plastic visphotak belt aadi se las the
 According to the local time, at around 6 am, the kidnappers reached a stairway for passengers to climb at the entrance of Pan Am Flight 73 with a van
 is vine main is tarah se badlaav kiye gaye the jisase ki yah airport suraksha vaahan jaisaa lage
 With this they managed to dodge the security guards
 aparankartaaon ne sidhiyon par hi hamalaa bol diya tathaa swachaalit hathiyaaron se golibari karte hue vimaan main ghus kar niyantran chin liya
 The flight attendant sensed the situation and informed the crew on the intercom, which resulted in the pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer successfully escaping through the emergency gate of the cockpit
 vimaan ko kabje main lene ke baad jald hi apaherta zaayad safarini ko ahsaas ho gaya ki chaalak dal bhaag chukaa he atah use adhikariyon se vaarta karne par majaboor hona padaa
 First and business class passengers were ordered to the rear of the aircraft and the rear passengers were asked to come forward
 kyonki vimaan puraa bharaa tha isliye yatriyon ko Since the plane was nearly full, passengers sat down in the aisles, galleys and door exits
 subah ke lagbhag 10 baje safarini ne vimaan ke andar ek chakkar lagaaya or 29 varshiya bhartiya america rajesh kumaar kii seat ke aage rukaa
 Rajesh was a resident of California and recently got US citizenship
 safarini ne rajesh ko aage aane ke liye kaha or vimaan ke dwaar par haath sir ke peeche kii ore rakhkar ghutanon ke bal baithne par majaboor kar diya
 Talking to the officials, especially Viraf Daroga, he said that if the crew was not sent to the aircraft in 15 minutes, he would shoot Rajesh
 thodi hi der baad vah adhikariyon se pareshaan ho uthaa or sabhi ke saamne usne rajesh ko sir main goli maar di or use darvaaze ke baahar zamin par phenk diya
 According to reports from Pakistani officials, Rajesh was still breathing but died in an ambulance on the way before reaching the hospital
 safarini tab vaapis apane baaki saathiyon ke paas aa gaya tathaa usne flite atendents ko sabhi yatriyon ke passport ikattha karne ke nirdesh die
 The attendants followed this order out of fear of their lives
 vimaan kii ek paricharika neeraja bhanot ko andeshaa tha ki america passport dharakon ko khaastaur par nishaanaa banaaya ja saktaa he, atah usne kuch american passports ko ek seat ke neeche chupa diya tathaa kuch ko koodaydaan main
 After collecting the passport, a crew member asked Michael Thexton, a British citizen on the intercom, to board the plane
 vah parade se hote hue vimaan ke agle hisse main pahunchaa jahaan uskaa saamana safarini se hua jiske haath main uskaa passport tha
 He asked Thexton if he was a soldier and whether he had a gun
 thexton ne nahin main jawaab diya
 He then asked Thexton to kneel down and told the officers that if someone came close to the plane, he would kill another passenger
 viraph daroga ne use bataaya ki vimaan main ek kru sadsy he jo cockpit kaa radio kaa prayog kar saktaa he or uske madhyam se aage baatcheet kii ja sakati he
 Safarini went back to Thexton and asked if he needed water
 thexton ne kaha - haan
 Safarini also asked if she was married and claimed that she did not like violence and all this killing, but the US and Israel had taken over their country and they could not live their life
 phir ek hijaikar ne thexton ko vaapis jane ko kaha
 The hijack episode lasted through the night
 is dauraan ek flite atendent ne manual main se chupchaap vah panna nikaal liya jisamen ki 3aar aircraft dwaar kii samast pranaaliyon kaa vivaran tha or ise ek magazine main chupa kar dwaar ke paas baithe yatri ko de diya
 He told her that she must read the magazine right now and use it later if needed

 At around 9 pm, the auxiliary power unit was shut down, all the lights were extinguished and the emergency light burned
 Passengers at the front were order toward the back, while passengers at the back were ordered forward
 Since the aisles were already full of passengers, those passengers standing just sat down
 With the plane out of power and sitting in near darkness a hijacker at the 1L door said a prayer and then aimed to shoot at the explosive belt the other hijacker at the 1R door was wearing
 The intent was to cause an explosion massive enough to kill all passengers and crew on board, as well as themselves
 Since the cabin was so dark, the hijacker missed causing only a small detonation
 Immediately the hijackers began shooting their weapons into the cabin at passengers and attempted to throw their grenades
 Yet again the lack of light caused them to not pull pins fully and create small explosions
 Ultimately it was their bullets that created most damage since each bullet would bounce off the aircraft and create crippling shrapnel
 The flight attendant at the 3L door decided it was time to take action and opened the door and although the slide did not deploy several passengers jumped down the 15 ft to the Tarmac, including crew
 The passenger that was near 3R had read the page the flight attendant earlier gave him and was able to successfully open that door
 It was the only door opened to have the slide deploy
 Ultimately this slide allowed for more passengers to evacuate safely and without injuries
 Neerja Bhanot assisted a number of passengers to escape from the flight, then she laid down her life shielding three children from the bullets fired by the terrorists
 Twenty passengers were killed and over a hundred were injured, but many escaped the ordeal including Michael Thexton, who came close to death a few hours before and returned to the UK pakistan ne turant es es ji divizan bheji tathaa army rangers ko taiyaar rahane ko kaha
 The incident escalated towards the end when the hijackers opened fire on the passengers of the aircraft

 'education psychology' is made up of the sum of two words - 'education' and 'psychology'
 atah iskaa shabdic arth he - shiksha sambandhi manovigyaan
 In other words, it is a practical form of psychology and a science studying human behavior in the process of education
 shiksha ke sabhi pahaluon jaise shiksha ke uddeshyon, shikshan vidhi, paathyakram, moolyankan, anushaasan aadi ko manovigyaan ne prabhavit kiya he
 The education process cannot run smoothly without the help of psychology
 shiksha manovigyaan se taatpary shikshan evam seekhney kii prakriya ko sudhaarney ke liye manovaigyanik siddhanton kaa prayog karne se he
 Education psychology studies the behavior of a person in educational situations
 is prakaar shiksha manovigyaan main vyakti ke vyavhaar, maansik prakriyaaon evam anubhavon kaa adhyayan shaikshik paristhitiyon main kiya jaataa he
 Education psychology is the branch of psychology whose aim is to develop effective teaching techniques and assess the abilities and interests of the learner
 yah vyavhaarik manovigyaan kii shakha he jo shikshan evam seekhney kii prakriya ko sudhaarney main prayasarat he
 Education psychology is the legislative science that discusses, analyzes and solves the problems of education
 shiksha, manovigyaan se kabhi pruthak nahin rahi he
 Psychology, whether it has been in the form of philosophy, has helped to develop the person through education
 naveen binwal ke anusaar : shiksha manovigyaan, shaikshanik paristhitiyon main maanviya vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata he
 Education psychology derives its meaning from education, which is social process and psychology, which is behavioral science
 Amit kumar ke anusaar : shiksha manovigyaan, vyakti ke janm se lekar vriddhavastha tak seekhney ke anubhavon kaa varnan tathaa vyakhya karata he
 According to Manzoor ahmad: Education psychology is that branch of applied psychology which deals with the application of psychological principles and discoveries in education as well as psychological study of the problems of education
 lala ji ke anusaar : shaikshik manovigyaan maanav pratikriyaaon ke shikshan or seekhney ko prabhavit vaigyanik drushti se vyutpann siddhanton ke anuprayog kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 In India, education is interpreted with knowledge
 gandhi ji ke anusaar shiksha kaa taatpary vyakti ke sharir, man or aatma ke samuchit vikaas se he
 To analyze the meaning of education psychology, Skinner has indicated the following facts: - kaili ne shiksha manovigyaan kii aavashyaktaa ko nimnanusaar bataaya haih- Regarding the field of education psychology, Skinner has written that in the field of education psychology, it is related to all the knowledge and techniques that are related to explaining the learning process better and determining it more efficiently
 aadhunik shiksha manovigyaanikon ke anusaar shiksha manovigyaan ke pramukh kshetra nimna prakaar he- Psychology is helpful in solving important problems of education and all these problems and their solutions become the domain of education psychology - keli ne shiksha manovigyaan ke kaaryo kaa nimna prakaar vishleshan kiya he - Education psychology is concerned with learning and learning methods
 shiksha tathaa manovigyaan gyaan kii do spasht shakhaaen he, parantu in dono kaa paraspar ghanishtha sambandh hai aadhunik shiksha kaa aadhaar manovigyaan he
 The child is educated by carefully studying his interests, trends, possibilities and personality
 aaj shiksha tathaa manovigyaan ek duusare ke poorak he
 Skinner Skinner opines that "education is a necessity of psychology education"
 isaki sahaayta ke bina shiksha kii gutthi sulajhaai nahin ja sakati
 Both education and psychology are concerned with behavior
 manovigyaan kii khojon kii shiksha ke duusare pahaluon par gahari chhap he
 '' shiksha tathaa manovigyaan siddhant tathaa vyavhaar kaa samanvay he, shiksha tathaa manovigyaan kaa parsparik sambandh kaa gyaan maanav ke samanvit santulit vikaas ke liye aavashyak he
 Similar work in education is based on the principles of psychology
 kro and kro ke anusaar ‘‘manovigyaan, vaataavaran ke sampark main hone vaale maanav vyavhaaron kaa vigyaan hai’’ manovigyaan seekhney se sambandhit maanav vikaas kii vyakhya karata he
 Education provides an effort to carry out the learning process
 shiksha manovigyaan seekhney ke kyon or kab se sambandhit he
 '' shiksha or manovigyaan ko jodne vaali kadi he ‘‘maanav vyavhaar’’
 The views of two scholars in this regard are visible: - brown- ‘‘shiksha vah prakriya he jiske dwaara vyakti ke vyavhaar main parivartan kiya jaataa he
 '' pilsbari- ‘‘manovigyaan maanav vyavhaar kaa vigyaan he
 '' in paribhaashaon se spasht he ki shiksha or manovigyaan donon kaa sambandh maanav vyavhaar se he
 Education changes human behavior and makes it perfect
 manovigyaan maanav vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata he
 Thus, it is natural to have a relationship between education and psychology, but in this regard it provides the basis for psychology
 shiksha ko apane prayek kaary ke liye manovigyaan kii sweekruti praapt kerani padati he
 Bn Jha has rightly written - "whatever education does and the way it is done, it has to depend on psychological discoveries
 ’’ Psychology has gained this place because it has revolutionized all fields of education by influencing them
 is sandarbh main rain ke ye sargarbhit vaakya ullekhneey he- All this has been possible due to the use of education psychology
 sankshep main manovigyaan ne shiksha ke kshetra main nimnlikhit yogadan kiya he- The problems of education are related to its objectives, subject matter, means and methods
 manovigyaan in chaaron kshetron main samasyaon ko sulajhane main sahaayta pradaan karata he
 Psychology helps in understanding the objectives of education as follows
 shiksha kii vishaywastu ko samajhane va uskaa nirdhaaran chaatr ke vikaas ke anuroop karne main manovigyaan kaa mahatvapurn yogadan hota hai
 What is the content for which class of students? What kind of indirect course that does not adversely affect the mental health of students, etc
 Psychology addresses important questions
 manovigyaan kii sahaayta se maanavjaati ko vishwa ke kalyaan hetu prayukt kar sakate he
 Psychology helps in understanding the means of education, because- manovigyaan shikshan kii vidhiyon ke bare main gyaan teen prakaar se detaa he - Davis has discussed the importance of education psychology in this way - psychology has contributed significantly in the field of education by analyzing students' aptitudes and the variations found in them
 isane vidyalayan varsho main chaatr kii vruddhi evam vikaas ke dhang ke bare main gyaan pradaan karke bhi yogadan diya he
 Blair has stated the importance of education psychology in the following words - vibhinn lekhakon ne shiksha manovigyaan kii bhinn-bhinn paribhaashaayen di he
 Therefore, certainly nothing can be said about the field of education psychology
 iske atirikt shiksha manovaigyanik ek nayaa tathaa panapata vigyaan he
 Its field is uncertain and assumptions are secret
 iske kshetron main abhi bahut si khoj ho rahi he or sambhav he ki shiksha manovigyaan kii nai dharanaen, niyam or siddhant praapt ho jaye
 Its sense is that the field of education psychology and problems are uncertain and variable
 chaahe kuch bhi ho nimnlikhit kshetra yaa samasyaon ko shiksha manovigyaan ke kaary kshetra main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Crow and Crow - "the content of education psychology is related to the conditions affecting learning
 ’’ Education psychology is being placed in the category of behavioral sciences
 vigyaan hone ke kaaran iske adhyayan main bhi anek vidhiyon kaa vikaas hua
 These methods are scientific
 george e lundburg ke shabdon main - The methods commonly used for study and research in education psychology can be divided into two parts: - inamen se kuch pramukh vidhiyon kaa nimnanusaar varnan kiya gaya he :- The method of self-inspection is also known as insight, internal inspection method
 stout ke anusaar ‘‘apana maansik kriyaaon kaa krambaddh adhyayan hi anternirikshan kehalaata he
 Woodworth called this method introspection
 is vidhi main vyakti kii maansik kriyaayein aatmagat hoti he
 Being introspective, introspection or insight method is more useful
 lock ke anusaar - mastishk dwaara apni swayan kii kriyaaon kaa nirikshan
 Person study method is used by psychologists for mental patients, criminals and people doing anti-social work
 bahudhaa manovaigyanik kaa anek prakaar ke vyaktiyon se paala padataa he
 Among them, there is a criminal, a mental patient, a quarrel, an anti-social worker and a problem child
 manovaigyanik ke vichaar se vyakti kaa bhautik, paariwarik va saamaajik vaataavaran usamen maansik asantulan utpann kar detaa he
 As a result, he starts behaving undesirable
 iskaa vaastavik kaaran jaanane ke liye vah vyakti ke purv itihaas kii kadiyon ko jodta he
 For this purpose, the person visits his parents, teachers, relatives, neighbors, friends etc
 and inquires
 is prakaar vah vyakti ke vanshanukram, paariwarik or saamaajik vaataavaran, ruchiyon, kriyaaon, shaareerik swasthya, shaikshik or samvegatmak vikaas ke sambandh main tathy ekatra karata he jinke falswaroop vyakti manovikaron kaa shikaar banakar anuchit aacharan karne lagata he
 Thus the purpose of this method is to discover the cause of a person's specific behavior
 kro va kro ne likhaa he ‘‘jivan itihaas vidhi kaa mukhya uddeshy kisi kaaran kaa nidaan karnaa he
 '' bahirdarshan vidhi ko avlokan yaa nirikshan vidhi bhi kaha jaataa he
 The common meaning of observation or observation is to look carefully
 ham kisi ke vyavhaar,aacharan evam kriyaaon, pratikriyaaon aadi ko baahar se dhyanpurvak dekhakar uski aantarik manahosthiti kaa anumaan laga sakate he
 For example: If a person is speaking loudly and his eyes are red then we can know that he is in anger
 kisi vyakti ko hansata hua dekhakar uske khush hone kaa anumaan laga sakate hai
 In the inspection method, the inspector observes the behavior being studied and based on that, he makes his perception about the subject
 vyavahaarwadiyon ne is vidhi ko vishesh mahatv diya he
 According to Kolesnik, there are two types of inspection - aupchaarik nirikshan niyantrit dashaon main or anaupchaarik nirikshan aniyantrit dashaon main kiya jaataa he
 Informal inspection of these is more useful for the teacher
 use kaksha or kaksha ke baahar apane chaatro ke vyavhaar kaa nirikshan karne ke liye anek avasar praapt hote he
 On the basis of this observation, he can gain knowledge of the norms of their behavior and give them suitable directions
 good tathaa hat ke anusaar - "saamanytah prashnawali shabdic prashnon ke uttar praapt karne kii vidhi he, jisamen vyakti ko swayan hi praaroop main bharkar dene hote hai
 In this method, it is important to collect the facts related to the problem by obtaining answers to the questions
 prashnawali ek prakaar se likhit prashnon kii yojanabaddh suchi hoti he
 In this, either space is kept for possible answers or possible answers are written
 " In this method, it is important to collect the facts related to the problem by meeting the people
 is vidhi ke dwaara vyakti kii samasyaon tathaa gunon kaa gyaan praapt kiya jaataa he
 In this, two persons have a face-to-face oral conversation, through which an attempt is made to find solutions to the problems of the person and to gain knowledge of physical and mental conditions
 good evam hat ke shabdon main - kisi uddeshy se kiya gaya gambheer vaartalap hi saakshaatkaar he
 "study of human behavior in predetermined conditions
" ’’ vidhi main prayogkarta swayan apane dwaara nirdhaarit kii hui paristhitiyon yaa vaataavaran main kisi vyakti ke vyavhaar kaa adhyayan karata he yaa kisi samasya ke sambandh main tathy ekatra karata he
 "treating the person's unconscious mind by studying
" ’’ is vidhi ke dwaara vyakti ke achetan man kaa adhyayan karke, uski atrupt ichchhaaon kii jaankaree praapt kii jaati he
 Thereafter, the person is treated by refining or modifying those desires and thus an attempt is made to make his behavior perfect
