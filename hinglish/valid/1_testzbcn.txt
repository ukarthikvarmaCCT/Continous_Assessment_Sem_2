 O! say can you see by the dawn’s early light,what so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,o’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?and the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,gave proof through the night that our flag was still there;o! say does that star-spangled banner yet wave,o’er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream: 'tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it waveo'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
 And where is that band who so vauntingly sworethat the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion,a home and a country, should leave us no more?their blood has washed out their foul footsteps’ pollution
no refuge could save the hireling and slavefrom the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:and the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,o’er the land of the free and the home of the brave
 O! Thus be it ever, when freemen shall standbetween their loved home and the war's desolation
blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued landpraise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation! Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: "in God is our trust;" And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall waveo'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! oh, mujhe bataao, tum bhor ke prakaash main dekh sakate ho,ham kitne garv se suryaast ke samay pichhali chamak kaa swaagat karte the,jisaki chaudee pattiyaan or chamakdaar sitare ko khatarnaak ladaai ke samay,pracheer ke sheersh par ham nazar rakhte the, wo kitni bahaduree se laharaata tha?or rocket kii laal chamak, hawa main foot rahe bamaraat ke madhyam se ye pramaani dete he ki hamaara dhvaj abhi bhi vahaan tha;oh, bataao ki kya sitar-susajjit dhvaj abhi bhi laharaa rahaa he,swatantra logon kii bhoomi or vir logon ke gharon par? Hidden in the deep fog on the coast, where the egoistic army of enemies has fallen into fear, Qu'est-ce que cette brise intermittente, le long du versant, Nous dévoile et nous cache? à présent elle capture l'éclat du premier rayon de soleil, Nous le renvoie dans toute sa gloire, maintenant elle brille dans le ventc'est la bannière étoilée! Oh puisse-t-elle longtemps flottersur la terre de la Liberté et la patrie des braves
 or kahan he wo band jo shekhi maarthe hue kasam khate hamedue les foudres de la guerre et la désolation des combatsne nous laisseraient ni terre ni patrie !leur sang a purifié la terre qu'ils ont foulée

 Oh! Qu'il en soit toujours ainsi, que les hommes libres protègentleur patrie chérie des désolations de la guerre! Blessed with triumph and peace, que la patrie protégée par le ciel Praise the power that created and protected us a nation
 or hamen avashya jeetna chahie, jab hamaara abhiyaan nyaaysangat he,or yah hamaara dhyey: “ishwar par hamen vishwaas he”
