 Around 1250 AD, the word 'university' started being used in a new sense and instead of erudite students, the rulers started establishing political and social needs of their states

 Due to the spread of education at the secondary level, the number of students in universities is increasing and the question is whether universities should place all the students who want to study further, or choose only those who are able to benefit from higher education

 bhagwaan kurm dwaara kathith hone ke kaaran hi is puraana kaa naam kurm puraana vikhyath hua
 This Purana of seventeen verses was given by Vishnu to King Indradyumna from the avatar of Kurma

 There are also eight Sahasra names of Parvati
 kaashi va prayag kshetra kaa mahatmaya, ishwar gita, vyas gita aadi bhi isamen samavisht hai
 Although the Koram Purana is a Vaishnavite purana, it also discusses Shaiva and Shakta faith
 is puraana main puraanon main paanchon pramukh lakshanon-sarg, pratisarg, vansh, manwantar evam vanshanucharit kaa krambaddh tathaa vistrut vivechan kiya gaya he
 There are 17,000 verses in this Purana, in this Purana, all the five main characteristics - canto, counterpart, lineage, manvantar and hereditary are arranged and detailed in the Puranas and all the subjects are mentioned proportionately
 bich-bich main aadhyatm-vivechan, kalikarm or sadachaar aadi par bhi prakaash daalaa gaya he
 In this Purana, which started as a dialogue of the Romaharada Sutra and the Shaunakadi Rishis, the first Sutra has discussed the story of the Lord's Koramvatar by calculating the purana-ghatna and the names of the eighteen Mahapuranas and Upapuranas
 kurmavatar ke hi prasang main lakshmi kii utpatti or mahatmaya, lakshmi tathaa indradyumna kaa vrittant, indradyumna ke dwaara bhagwaan vishnu kii stuti, varna, ashram or unke kartavya varnan tathaa parabrahm ke rup main shivatatva kaa pratipaadan kiya gaya he

 This Purana, with the wonderful syncretism of the three main sects of Hinduism, Vaishnavism, Shaiva, and Shakta, depicts the unity of the trinity, the impenetration of shakti-shaktimaan and the supreme recitation of Vishnu and Shiva

 Kadambari is a great novel of Sanskrit literature
 iske rachanaakaar vanbhatta hai
 It is entitled to be called the world's first novel
 isaki katha sambhavtah gunanty dwaara rachit baddkaha ke raja sumanas kii katha se lee gayi he
 This book could not be completed in the lifetime of Banabhatta
 unki mrityu ke baad unke putr bhushanbhatta ne ise puraa kiya or pita dwaara likhit bhaag kaa naam 'purvabhag' evam swayan dwaara likhit bhaag kaa naam 'uttarbhag' rakhaa
 Where Harshacharitam is ideal for a narrative, there is prose poetry in the form of Kadambari Katha
 baan ke hi shabdon main is katha ne purvavarti do kathaon kaa atikaraman kiya he
 Unavailable Vaidagdhyavilasamuddhaya Dhia nibhitaye-matidvayi katha-kadambari
 sambhavtah ye kathaayen gunanty kii brihatkatha evam subandhu kii vaasavadatta thim
 It seems that Baan died without completing this work, as his son has said: pulind athwa bhushanbhatta ne is katha ko sampoorn kiya
 The story of Kadambari is summarized as follows: isamen ek kaalpanik katha he jisamen chandrapid tathaa pundaree ke teen janmon kaa ullekh he
 According to the narration, Atisha Sundari Chandal brings a parrot named Kanya Vaishampayan to the court of Naresh Shudraka
 yah tota manushya kii boli bolta he
 In the King's q & A, the parrot tells that his mother is dead and that his father was captured by the hunter and took him to the ashram after capturing the disciple of Zabali Muni
 isi ke bich rishi jabali dwaara raja chandrapid tathaa uske mitra vaishampayan kii katha he
 In Ujjayini there was a king named Tarapid who had a wise minister named Shuknas
 raja ko chandrapid naam ke ek putr kii prapti hui or mantri ke putr kaa naam vaishampayan tha
 In the context of Digvijay, Chandraped arrived at a beautiful Achhodasarovar where a beautiful girl named Kumari Mahasweta, waiting for the late lover Pundarik in the untimely, found her
 mahasweta ne apni sakhi kadambari ke vishay main chandrapid ko bataaya or uske kadambari ke paas le gayi
 Kadambari and Chandrapid fell in love with the first darshan
 tabhi chandrapid ke pita ne use vaapis bulaayaa or apni patralekha naam kii paricharika ko kadambari ke paas chhodkar chandrapid waapas aa gaya
 Patralekhaa also pleased Chandrapid by sending Kadambari-related information
 baan kii kriti yahan samaapt ho jaati he
 As far as the plot is concerned, Banabhatta is indebted to Brihatkatha
 somdev dwaara rachit brihatkatha ke sanskrit sanskaran main uplabdh somdev evam kamarandrika kii katha chandrapid evam kadambari kii katha se samya rakhti hai
 But the characterization of Shuknas is the imagination of Vaishampayan and the love story of Mahashweta etc
 kathanak ke avishkaar ke liye baan ko yash praapt nahin hua balki udaatt charitra-chithran, vividh varnan, maanviya bhaavon ke chithran tathaa prakruti soundarya ke kaaran hi baan ko kaviyon main ucch sthaan kii prapti hui he
 Baan is a monarch of Sanskrit-prose
 baan kii kadambari apni adbhut kathavstu, rasaatmakataa tathaa ascharyajanak style ke kaaran sadaa kautuhal kii vastu rahi he
 The extreme splendor of ornate prose, with its entire grandiose possibilities, has appeared in his Kadambari with full vigor
 parantu iske brihadaakaar, vikat style, virat vaakyavali, anant visheshantati se aachchann antahin varnanon tathaa dussadhay bhashaa ne ise bahudhaa shramsadhy tathaa vidvadgamya bana diya he
 It is incurable and inaccessible to the ordinary reader
 vah uske aswadan se vanchit rah jaataa he
 To make this interesting but annoying prose poem a tradition, its simple and concise adaptations started
 ab tak kadambari ke gadhy or padya main nibaddh 12 saar prakaash main aa chuke hai
 Atul Aishwarya of Sanskrit prose, his subtle influences, the hearty softness and the euphoric consternation with which the skill could be exploited is radiant in Kadambari
 baan kii kala kaa sparsh paakar kadambari chhando-viheen kavita ban gayi he
 The classical pattern of prose that Subandhu had enforced, Baan accepted it, but by incorporating 'poetic beauty' into it, it has given him incomplete balsam
 kala-shilp tathaa bhavasbalata ke manjul mishran ke kaaran hi sanskrit gadhyakaron main baan kaa sthaan sarvopari he
 Rasa-gradation, art-aesthetics, curvilinear expression system, condescending phonology, lamp, metaphor and rhetorical scheme of hypocrisy, intertwined with intertwined syllogism, contradiction and parody, are personal features of the prose of the arrow
 baan ke haath main aakar sanskrit gadhy kavita kii udaatt bhavbhumi ko pahunch gaya he
 But weighed by the mixed rage in Baan's Rasavanti 'kadambari', Weber has compared his prose to Indian Kantar, in which the wanderer has to make his own path by cutting through the axes of grit and grit with the ax of his patience and labor
 
 us par bhi use aprachlit shabdon ke rup main upasthit vanyajeevon kii dahaad kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 This attack by Weber is not entirely unfounded
 apni vikatbandhata, samasankulapadawalee, shlisht evam deergh varnanawali ke kaaran kadambari panditvarg ke bauddhik vilaas kii vastu hone kaa abhas detii he
 In fact, there is no such subject, emotion and expression-type, which the arrow has not invented continuously
 sahruday aalochak ne 'banochishtan jagatsarvam' kah baan kii is uplabdhi kaa abhinandan kiya he
 The complexity and greatness of Kadambari led to the tradition of its simple and concise variations, so that even the common people can appreciate it
 gadhy-padya main nibaddh iske lagbhag 12 saar gyaat athwa uplabdh he
 The available abstracts of Kadambari can be divided into two main classes
 pratham koti ke saar ve hai, jinamein kadambari kaa vibhinn lekhakon dwaara swatantra, swabhaasha main padhyabaddh sankshep prastut kiya he
 The acclaimed kadambari-kathasar, Mandanpranit Kadambaridarpan and Dhundirajit Abhinav Kadambari are the representatives of this class
 laghukadambarisangrah, chandrapidcharit, chandrapidkatha, kadambarikathasaar, kadambarisar tathaa kadambarisangrah baan kii shabdaawalee main nibaddh, kadambari ke gadyatmak sankshep hai
 Apart from these, Kadambarisar, the Suryanarayan Shastri, is a proselytized abbreviation of Kadambari

 aisi baaten bhi jo aamtaur par lokapriy kalakaar shaayad hi kahana pasand karen jaise - Popular artist Sasikala in the ongoing series today told that when she was doing social service in Calcutta in Mother Teresa's ashram, she had a great desire to meet Mother and when she came, how like a little child, she came from outside the door
 Was beginning to see jab mainen is str par baatcheet suni to mujhe laga yah to camel ji kaa hi kamaal he or kya tarika rahaa hoga prastutakarta kaa or kya chhavi he vividh bharti kii ki ek kalakaar apana dil khol kar rakh detaa he
 Only one series which has not been completed yet, after listening to it, got a lot of information about Vee Shantaram, which Sasikala called Anna Saheb

 When i talked about Lata Mangeshkar and Meenakumari, i remembered the film Phool Aur Patthar with Vamp made Sasikala sings - shishe se pi yaa paimaane se piyaa meri aankhon ke maykhaane se pi And the most remembered is the last scene where she goes to the township to meet Dharmendra wearing her special Vampanuma clothes and all the township is gathered to see her
 vividh bharti ne hameshaa apni jimmedaari ko samajha he or tatparta se ise nibhaayaa bhi he
 It is the only radio channel in the country which has considered music as its religion and has given all types of music in its programs
 vividh bharti ne documentation kaa kaam bhi kiya he
 Since Vividh Bharati is basically a film entertainment service, recordings of well-known film personalities are always given priority
 aaj vividh bharti ke paas filmi hastiyon or sangeet jagat kii hastiyon kii jitani recording hai utani shaayad kahin or nahin hongi
 Recording of every important film personality from Raj Cooper to Shahid Kapoor and from Nargis to Priyanka Chopra is preserved in the museum of Vividh Bharati
 lekin jab ye mahasoos kiya gaya ki kisi filmi hasti kii choti si recording shrotaaon kii jaruraton ko puraa nahin karti to ek nayaa kaarykram shuru hua jiskaa naam tha ujaale unki yaadon ke
 Through this program many film personalities' entire life journey was discussed

 Clothes, shoes, appliances, jewelry and cosmetics were the first of the ways that we managed to do this, but lipstick and facial pants were one of the most important ways to change our appearance
 shikari behatar apane parivesh, pujaariyon or acolytes ke saath mishran karne ke liye apni twachaa chitrit unke devataaon or vishwaason kaa sammaan karne ke liye khud ko sajaayaa gaya he or yuva logon ko vipareet ling ke liye or adhik sundar banane ke liye unhen kalpana or pradarshan har tarah se istemaal kiya

 One of the best questions is the term "caste" which is being described by zoologists and this discussion is known as the problem of castes
 darwin ne on da orijan of spasis ke adhyay II main likhaa
 But later, Darwin amended his view in The Descent of Man by saying "whether humans consist of one or many castes"
 vikaas kaa aadhunik siddhant "jati" kii nai moolbhoot paribhaashaon par nirbhar he
 Prior to Darwin, naturalists viewed castes as ideal or common types, which can be exemplified with an ideal model that has all the same qualities as a normal race
 darwin ke siddhant kii ekarupata ne dhyaan ko saadhaaran se vishesh kii taraf sthanantarit kar diya
 According to intellectual historian Lewis Meinand, yah "jati" ko nae drushtikon main badal detaa he; darwin In practice, biologists have defined castes as populations of animals that have high levels of genetic similarity
 yah usee jeevakosh ke anukulan ko pratibimbit or anuvaanshik saamagree kaa ek se duusare main sambhavit sadhano kii kismon ko sthanantarit kar sakati he
 The exact level of similarity in this type of definition is used unilaterally, but it is the most common definition used for animals causing asexual reproduction, such as some plants and micro-organisms
 sookshm jeev vigyaan main kisi bhi spasht jati kii kami kii badhya ne kuch lekhakon ko tark dene ke liye badhya kar diya he ki jeevanu kaa adhyayan karte samay "jati" shabd kaa upyog sahi nahin he
 Instead, they observed genes far-flung related bacteria, bacteria associated with the entire bacterial region, with a gene pool independently

 The concept has recently been updated, stating that the 97% threshold was too low and could be increased to 98

 In a way "caste" is a group of inter-breeding beings
 is paribhaasha ko yah kehete hue aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he ki jati praaniyon kaa vah samooh he jo sambhavit taur se antarjaatiy prajnan karne main sakasham he - machhliyon ko usee jati main rakhaa ja saktaa he bhale hi ve bhinn-bhinn jhiilon main rahati hon kyonki ve antarjaatiy prajnan kar sakati hai yadi ve kabhi bhi ek duusare ke sampark main aayin hon
 duusari ore, teen yaa adhik vicitra aabaadi vaale bahut se udhaaharan hai ki kya bich main aabaadi vaale jantu duusare prakaar kii aabaadi vaale jantuon main antar prajnan kar sakate hai lekin duusari taraf aabaadi vaale ye jantu antar prajnan karne main sakasham nahin hai
 Thus, it is debatable whether these populations constitute one or two different castes
 isamen koi virodhabhas nahin he ki jatiyon ko jin aavritiyon ke aadhaar par paribhaashit kii jaati hai or is prakaar se unki aspasht simaaen hai
 Consequently, the universal definition of "caste" is necessarily unilateral
 iske bajaay, jeev vigyaniyon ne bahut si paribhaashaayen di hai; jiskaa upyog koi jeev vigyaani ke liye paripurna vikalp he, vah us jeev vigyaani ke shodh kii visheshtaon par nirbhar karata he
 In practice, these definitions are similar and their case is more important than the outright contradiction between them
 phir bhi, abhi tak prastaavit jati kii koi bhi avadharana puri tarah se uddeshypurna nahin he yaa kisi nirnay ke liye sahaayta liye bina sabhi maamalon main lagu ho saktaa he
 Given the complexity of life, some say that the definition of such an objective is impossible in all kinds of possibilities and that biologists must determine the most plausible definition
 adhikansh ridh vihin praaniyon main yah sabhi jaivik jatiyon kii avadharana he or filogenetic jati kii avdhaaran main kaaphi had tak kam he
 Many BSC sub-castes are considered castes under the PSC; The difference between BSC and PSC can be determined because the BSC defines race as a result of a clear evolutionary history, whereas PSC defines a race as a result of a clear evolutionary possibility
 is prakaar se, PSC jatiyon ko "banaaya" gaya jaise hi vikasvaadi vansh ko alag kiya janaa shuru hua, jabaki BSC jati ne keval tabhi nikalnaa shuru kiya jab unka vansh kaa algaav purna ho gaya
 Accordingly, substantial controversy between alternative classifications based on PSC vs
 BSC is possible because they are totally different depending on the behavior of their taxa, which would be considered sub-casts under the latter model
 jivan ke samarthan vaali jatiyaan: kai jatiyaan paryaavaran ke anukulan ke prati bilkul vicitra hoti hai, kyonki ve kuch sthitiyon ke antargat paidaavaar yaa prajnan karne main sakasham hai jaise sookhaa, banjar, baadh, mitti kii vishaaktata, mitti kii lavanta jinamein se bahut se bhojan, samagriyaan pradaan karte hai or maanav ko shakti pradaan karne vaale pashudhan or anya jaanwaron manushya ke liye sambhavit rup se laabhakaari maane jate hai or ye jivan sahaayak jatiyon ke rup main jaani jaati hai
 As such they consist of mutual main castes because they have the main key to the integrity of the landforms that comprise the bio-data and human communities of both creatures

 Considering the problems mentioned earlier with the classification of castes, the following numbers are merely nominal guidance
 2007 main, ve nimnanusaar the: Total number of castes: 7-100 million including: eukrayete jatiyon main se hamane keval inaki pahchaan hi kar sake: Currently, the Global Texonomy Initiative, the European Distributed Institute of Texonomy and the Census of Marine Life are attempting to reform the taxonomy and implement the taxonomy system from previously unknown nations
 is satya ke kaaran ki ham jeev mandal main keval kuch praaniyon ko hi jaanate hai, phir bhi hamen apane paryaavaran ke kaamkaaj kii puri samaj nahin he
 According to Professor James Mellet, despite the discovery of new castes, we are making matters worse and we are ending these castes with unprecedented speed
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki kisi nai jati ko praapt karne se pehle iskaa adhyayan or vargeekaran kiya janaa chahie, chunki ho saktaa he ki vah pehle se hi vilupt ho chuki ho
 The notion of castes has a long history
 kai kaarnon se yah vargeekaran ke sabase mahatvapurn staron main se ek he: After years of experimentation, the concept of biology has been prominent as a host of related fields but has not yet been fully defined
 kisi vishesh jati ke namakaran ke jeevon ko us samooh ke jeevon ke vikasvaadi sambandh or or unki vividhta ke bare main pariklpana maani jaani chahie
 The hypothesis can be confirmed or refuted as advance information comes in hand
 kabhi-kabhi, khaskar jab ateet main sanchaar bahut adhik mushkil tha, to algaav par kaary karne vaale vargeekaran vaigyanikon ne alag-alag jantuon ko alag-alag naam die jinaki pahchaan baad main ek samaan jati ke rup main kii gai
 When a two-name caste was discovered as a single caste, the old caste name was usually retained and the new caste name was given that name, a process that is synonymous with aggregation or a colloquial process
 It is called
 texon ko ek se adhik main vibhajit karne main aamtaur se nayaa vaala vibhaajan texons kehalaata he
 Taxonomy Scientists are usually called "lumpers" or "splitters" by their classmates, depending on their individual attitudes and similarities to the differences identified between animals
 paramparaagat rup se, shodhakarta sanrachanaatmak antaron ke avlokan or is avlokan par ki kya bhinn aabaadi main jatiyon main atar ke liye unka antar prajnan safaltaapurvak kiya gaya athwa nahin, par bharosa karte hai; donon sharir rachana or prajnan vyavhaar donon hi abhi bhi jatiyon kii sthiti bataane ke liye mahatvapurn hai
 In the last few decades, as a result of the revolution in microbiological research techniques, DNA analysis has provided unfathomable knowledge about differences and similarities between castes
 kai aabaadiyaan jo pehle pruthak jatiyon ke rup main maani jaati thim ko ab ek texonmana jaataa he or purv samoohikrut aabaadi ko vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Any classification level can be synonymous or subdivided, and at higher taxonomic levels these modifications are still very unfathomable
 vargeekaran ke drushtikon se, jati main samoohon ko jati kii tulana main texon vargeekaran ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Only sub-castes are used in zoology whereas diversity, sub-diversity and form have been used in botany
 sangrakshan jeev vigyaan main, vikasvaadi mahatvapurn ikai kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jise jati yaa adhik choti vicitra aabaadi vaale khand ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 In the early work of science, castes were simply individual beings representing their own or nearly identical group of beings
 us samay un par inke alaava koi anya sambandh lagu nahin hote the
 Aristotle used the term genus and caste to refer to caste or special classes
 arestu or anya purv-darvinian vaigyanikon ne jatiyon ko "saar" jaise rasinic tatwon ke rup main vishesh or aparivartaneey mana
 jab aarambhik prekshkon ne jeevon ke liye sanghathan ko pranali ke rup main viksit karnaa chaalu kiya, to unhone pehle se pruthak ko is sthaan par rakhana aarambh kar diya
 Many of these early illustration schemes will no longer be considered eccentric and include colors or behaviors based on coherence
 18 veen sadi main swedish vaigyanik carolas linius ne prajnan angon ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya
 Although their type of classification of organisms classified organisms according to similarity, they did not make any claims about the relationship between similar castes
 
 us samay, vyapak rup se abhi bhi yah vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki jatiyon ke madhya koi bhi mana he ki vahaan jaivik jatiyon ke bich koi bhi jaivik sambandh nahin tha, bhale hi ve kitne hi samaan dikhaai kyon na dete hon
 is drushtikon ne bhi ek prakaar ke adarshavaad kaa suzav diya: yah dharna ki maujuuda sabhi jatiyaan ek "adarsh swaroop" he
 Although there are always differences between all the organisms over there, Linnaeus considered such differences problematic
 He attempted to identify individual organisms which were exemplary of castes and considered other non-exemplary organisms to be unusual and incomplete
 19 veen sadi tak adhikansh prakrutivaadee samaj gaye the ki jati samay samay par badal sakati hai or yah ki grih ke itihaas ne unamem mukhya parivartanon ke liye paryaapt samay diya tha
 jean-baptiste Lamarck gave the first logical idea against creation-theory in Zoological Philosophy
 jatiyaan samay ke saath-saath kaise badal sakati he ke nirdhaaran ke bare main nai praathamikta thi
 Lamarck suggested that the organism could pass on an inherited trait to its incoming lineage, such as reaching the leaves of a giraffe's long neck-high trees was a trait of the giraffe's generation
 haalanki, 1860 main charles darwin kii prakritik chayan vichaar kii sweekruti ke saath, lenmark ke lakshya-unmukh vikaas ke drushtikon jise teleological prakriya ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he ko prabhaavaheen kar diya gaya tha
 Recent interest in inheritance of features acquired around methylation processes such as methylation that does not affect DNA sequence, but expression may be altered in an inherited manner
 is prakaar, nio-lamarkwaad, jiseki kabhi-kabhi iske bare main baat bhi hui hai ki prakritik chayan ke saath vikaas kaa siddhant koi chunauti nahin he
 Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace gave the idea which is still followed by the theory of scientific development in the most powerful and compelling form
 darwin ne tark diya ki yah shaamil aabaadi hi thi koi praani maatr nahin
 His argument is more credible than the perspective of Linnaeus's radical stream: Instead of interpreting race as an ideal term, Darwin considered the difference between organisms to be natural
 He further argues that his explanation for the existence of a rare caste, far from problematic, was in fact
 darwin ke kaam ne thomas malthske antardrushti ko apni taraf aakarshith kiya ki jaivik jansankhya kii vruddhi dar paryaavaran main sansadhano kii vruddhi dar se hameshaa aage rahegi jiseki bhojan kii aapurti
 iske parinamswaroop, darwin ne tark diya ki aabaadi ke sabhi jeev nirvaah or prajnan karne main sakasham nahin honge
 The work done by them will be average, but there will be a difference - although they will make it a little more environmentally friendly
 If the difference of these qualities is ancestral, then the descendants of the survivors will take them
 is prakaar, kai pidiyon se anukuli vividhtaayen aabaadi main jamaa ho jaaengi, jabaki pratikul gun samaapt ho jaaenge
 It should be emphasized whether a difference in the environment is adaptive or non-adaptive: different environments favor different qualities
 kyonki paryaavaran hi kargar dhang se is baat kaa chayan karata he ki kis praani ko prajnan ke liye jivit rahanaa he or vah paryaavaran hi he jo is baat kaa nirdhaaran karte he ki kaunse gun aage jane chahie
 It is the principle of evolution by natural selection
 is model main, ek jiraph kii gardan kii lambaai kii vyakhya sthiti ke anusaar kii jaaegi ki lambii gardan vaale proto-jiraph ne vishesh prajnankaree visheshaataaon ko choti gardan vaale jiraph se praapt kiya kai pidiyon se, puri aabaadi lambii gardan vaale pashuon kii jati kii hogi
 In 1859, when Darwin published his theory of natural selection, there was no knowledge of mechanisms with individual properties of inheritance at that time
 haalanki darwin ne gun ke vanshanukram se praapt hone ke bare main kuch kalpanaaen kii, lekin usnaa siddhant keval is sachai par aadhaarit tha ki vanshanukram gun maujuud hote hai or ve parivartanashin hote hai
 However, the paper on Gregor Mandel's genetics was published in 1866 without identifying its characteristics
 is par 1900 tak koi kaary nahin kiya gaya jab unke kaary kii pun: khoj hugo di verise, karl corence or erik won semark dwaara tab kii gai jab unhen is baat kaa abhas hua ki darwin ke siddhant main "vanshanukram gun" jin hai
 The classification of castes of evolution through natural selection has two important assumptions for the discussion of castes - those results fundamentally challenge Linnaeus's hypotheses in favor of taxonomies
 sabase pehle isse yah pataa chalaa ki jatiyaan keval samaan nahin hai balki ve vastav main sambandhit bhi ho sakati he
 Some Darwin students argue that all species are descendants of common ancestors
 doosraa, yah mana jaataa he ki "jati" sajaateey, sthir, sthaayee chijen nahin he; jati ke sadsy bilkul bhinn hai or bahut samay pehle jatiyon main parivartan hua he
 This suggests that castes have no particular boundary region but have statistically significant effects of continuously changing gene-frequencies
 abhi bhi koi vyakti linius ke vargeekaran kaa upyog paudhon or jaanwaron kii pahchaan ke liye kar saktaa he, lekin koi bhi vyakti ab jatiyon ke swatantra or aparivartaneey rup ke bare main soch bhi nahin saktaa
 The development of a new caste from the ancestral lineage is called speciation
 isaki vanshaj jati se purvaj jati kaa nirdhaaran koi spasht vansh vaala simakan nahin he
 However, current scientific knowledge of castes has shown that in all cases there is no concrete and comprehensive way to differentiate between different castes, so that zoologists continue to look for concrete methods to carry out the idea
 
 One of the most popular biological definitions about race is in terms of reproductive isolation, if two animals are not capable of breeding hybrid offspring of both sexes, they belong to different races
 is paribhaasha main sahaj gyaan yukt jatiyon kii simaaen hai, lekin yah apurna hai
 For example, there is nothing to say about the caste that breed asexually and it is very difficult to apply it to the extinct castes
 iske alaava, jatiyon ke bich kii simaaen aksar aspasht hoti hai: aise kai udhaaharan hai jahaan par kisi vishesh aabaadi ke sadsy duusari aabaadi vaale praaniyon ke saadh jananksham sankar vansh kaa prajnan karte hai or duusari aabaadi ke sadsy teesri aabaadi vaale praaniyon ke saadh upjau sankar vansh kaa prajnan kar sakate hai lekin pehali or teesri aabaadi vaale sadsy upjau sankar kaa prajnan nahin kar sakate yaa keval mata pita se hi upjau vansh ko janm sambhav he
 As a result, some people reject this definition of caste
 richard daakins do praaniyon kii vyakhya sajaatiyata ke rup main karte hai or yadi unke chromosomes kii sankhya samaan hoti he or prayek chromosomam ke liye donon praaniyon main samaan sankhya main gunasutra hote hai 
 haalanki, adhiktar sabhi vargeekaran vaigyanik is bate se asahmat honge
 For example, in many amphibians, especially in New Zealand, the genome of Leopelma frogs has "native" genomes that are not distinct and have secondary chromosomes that exist in many combinations
 haalanki, aabaadi ke gunasutron kii sankhya main atyadhik antar paaya jaataa he, phir bhi ye safaltaapurvak antar prajnan kar sakate hai or ek ekal vikaskaari ikai banaate hai
 In plants, polyploidy is a highly common site with some inhibitions on differential reproduction; Because sets of chromosomes of animals are dissected by even numbers, which depends on the actual number of sets of current chromosomes where some animals of the same evolutionary unit can interbreed with some others and some and not the entire population
 Has been specifically linked to form a common gene pool
 jatiyon kaa vargeekaran vishesh taur se takneekee pragati se prabhavit ho rahaa he jisaki anumati shodhakartaaon ne unke sambandh ko anvik nishaan ke aadhaar par, crude rakt plasma vaale teevr pramaanon ko 20veen shatabdi ke madhya main charles sible ke ground-braking DNA-DNA sankaran adhyayan, 1970 main, kii tulana main DNA takanic anukraman ko janm diya
 These techniques resulted in radical changes in the higher taxonomic classes, leading to the rearranged results of many branches of the phylogenetic tree
 For the taxonomic sections of Jainra below, the results were mixed together; At the molecular level, the pace of evolutionary change was slowed, giving clear differences only after a suitable period of reproductive isolation
 While the results of DNA – DNA hybridization were misleading, the Pomeranian Scoa - Great Scoa phenomenon became a well-known example
 kachhue ko aanvik str par anya sarisrup kii gati ke maatr aathven bhaag ke saath viksit hone ke liye nirdhaarit kiya gaya or albatras main aanvik vikaas kii dar storm-petrals kii tulana main lagbhag aadhi hi pai jaati he
 Obsolete hybridization techniques are available nowadays and are replaced by more reliable computational approaches for sequence comparisons
 anvik vargeekaran sidhe vikasvaadi prakriyaaon par aadhaarit nahin he, balki in prakriyaaon dwaara samgr parivartan kiya jaataa he
 Processes that represent generation and diversity maintenance such as change, process of change, and selection are not homogenous

 hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar sansar kaa sabase bada bhashaa parivaar hai
 The indo-european language family includes hundreds of languages and dialects of the world
 aadhunik hind europea bhashaaon main se kuch hai : hindi, urdu, angrezi, francisi, german, portugali, spanish, dach, farsi, bangla, punjabi, roosi, ityadi
 All these languages are derived from the same primitive language, can give it the name of primitive-indo-european language
 yah sanskrit se bahut milti-julati thi, jaise ki vah saanskrit kaa hi aadim rup ho
 The features of these languages are that all ancient indo-european languages had many word-forms of noun, pronoun, adjective and verb, which showed their grammatical form in a sentence
 adhiktar ye shabd-rup shabd ke ant main pratyay dwaara banaaye jaati the 
 The words used for everyday things, relatives, common animals, verbs were very similar to each other in all the ancient languages of this family and on this basis linguists envisaged the primitive-indo-european language
 in vibhinn bhashaayon ke shabdon ke rup isliye milte-julate the kyonki yah ek hi pracheen jad se utpann hue sajaateey shabd the
 The table below gives some words from the common vocabulary of some ancient and new indo-european languages and the reconstructions of the presumed primitive indo-european
 hind europea parivaar kii kai shakhaayen hai
 The sub-branch of each branch and the main ancient and modern languages included in it and their main countries are given below
 hind europea shakhaon ko mukhyatah do virgon main rakhaa jaataa he : kentum varg or saatam varg
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: kya, gy and ghya, changed to touch-struggling or struggling consonants, such as: ch, j, s and sh
 saath hi saath, aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 These include the Baltic, Slavic, indo-iranian, Armenian, and Albanian branches
 sanskrit isi varg main aati he
 In the ancient languages of this class, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Qu, Gw and Gv were preserved in the same way
 aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, inamen vilay ho gayi : k, ga or gha
 It consists of Italian, Greek, Celtic and Germanic branches
 sanskrit shabd arya kaa matlab hota tha kuleen or sabhy
 That is why the old ritualists, such as Max Müller, named the primitive- and modern indo-european language-speaking castes as "arya"
 ye naam europea logon ko bahut pasand aayaa or jald hi sabhi europea vaasiyon ne apane apane deshon ko pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi bataanaa shuru kar diya 
 Especially Hittler propagated that Germany is the birthplace of ancient Aryans and Arya means pure generation, whose skin is fair, long, eyes blue and hair golden
 hitlar ke anusaar german log hi sarvocch or sarvashaktimaan nasl ke hai or vishesh taur par yahudee log ghatiya nasl ke or anarya hai 
 The British publicized that around 1700 BC
 In the indo-aryan tribes, coming from Europe, invaded the Indus Valley and devastated the indigenous Indus Valley civilization of India and massacred its inhabitants and later made the remaining people slaves - who were enslaved and bandit in the Rigveda
 Having said 
 hitlar ke yahudee narsanhaar ke baad ab "arya" shabd kaa matlab bhashaai arth main lagaaya jaataa he, na ki nasl ke liye
 But historians and linguists are still searching for the birthplace of the Aryans

 Although most extinct species of this species are not food, their biomass is being transformed into human food when their habitat is transformed into pastures, croplands and orchards
 It is estimated that the biomass of the Earth is More than 40% represent that only a few species are tied to humans, livestock and crops
 Because an ecosystem decreases in stability as its species Are not extinct, these studies show that it is further reduced in complexity that warns destined to collapse the global ecosystem

 The existence of a rich diversity of unique species across many parts of the world exists simply because they are protected from obstacles, particularly large rivers, seas, seas, mountains, and deserts from other species of other country masses, especially high, ultra fertile, competitive The generalist are separating "super-species"
 These barriers are overcome by natural processes, through many millions of years in the future
 Continental drift can never occur

 Purebred naturally evolved region specific wild species can be threatened with extinction in a big way through the process of genetic pollution ie uncontrolled hybridization, introgression and genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or replacement of local genotypes as a result of either a numerical and / or fitness advantage of introduced plant or animal
 Nonnative species can bring about previously isolated species in contact, through purposeful introduction by hybridization and introgression about a form of extinction of native plants and animals, either through humans or habitat modification

 Attention has to be focused on the limitation of this under the problem of appreciation that is not always clear
 Morphological observations alone
 To some degree gene flow may be a normal, evolutionarily anatomical process and all constellations occur in genes and genotypes
 However, With or without introgression hybridization may not be preserved, however, a rare species' existence may be threatened

 Local governments and industry have since been prompting hybridization with such enthusiasm that many of the wild and indigenous breeds have already become extinct years ago but thousands of local extremes in immunity to climate and diseases etc
 Due to complete disuse because of un-profitability and uncontrolled intentional and unintentional cross-pollination and crossbreeding) formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution resulting in great loss in genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole

 It is being said that genetic erosion coupled with genetic pollution is destroying that needed unique genetic base thereby creating an unforeseen hidden crisis which will result in a severe threat to our food security for the future when diverse genetic material will cease to exist to be able to further improve or hybridize weakening food crops and livestock against more resistant diseases and climatic changes
