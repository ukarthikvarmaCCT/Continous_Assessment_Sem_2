 solukhumbu jilla Buddha did not want to initiate a woman on his path
 He was able to initiate only on very insistence
 Before giving initiation, additional eight rules were provisioned, and then he gave initiation
 Some of which are as follows: - 
 chaahe bhikshuni ne sau varsh se upasmapda praapt kii ho or chaahe bhikkhu usee din upasmapda praapt kiya ho, to bhi bhikshuni ko hi uskaa satkar karnaa hoga, use, maananaa hoga, poojana hoga, is dharm vinay kaa jivan bhar atikaraman nahin karnaa hoga | 
 The monk must not abuse the monk under any circumstances
 This inhuman rule will not have to be encroached throughout life, it will have to be entertained, it has to be accepted and worshiped
 buddha ne stri va purush dono ko bhinn janaa he | unhone in donon ko bahiya va aantarik tal par shaareerik rup se, va maansik rup se bhi bhinn paaya he | unhone bhinn to paaya he, par ooncha nicha nahin kaha he | buddha ne inke bhinn hone ke kaaran hi vyavastha bhi bhinn kii he | buddha kaa sab manushyon ke prati samanta kaa bhav kuch gaharaa he | upar upar se to yahi lagegaa ki buddha stri ke prati samanta ke pakshdhar nahin he | par aisa he nahin | In fact, the path of Buddha is enlightenment, determination is path, not devotion
 The centers of consciousness of man and woman are also different
 The man is basically mind centered
 All his emphasis is intellectual
 He weighs everything on the basis of logic
 There is no scope for emotion in reasoning
 Only a rational person can easily resolve
 That is why a rational person is also tough
 This person is compatible with the path of Buddha
 Only a few people will be found feminine in men
 And very few women will find men with male images
 On the other hand, the bottom of the woman's consciousness is emotion-oriented
 The amount of love, the amount of emotion is intense in a woman
 Surrender is easy in that
 It is easy to lose consciousness, to become insensitive towards oneself
 This woman's dimensions fall against the path of Buddha
 The path of Buddha is the path of consciousness and determination
 is sthiti main yadi buddha striyon ko bhi jyon kaa tyon diksha de dete hai, to adhiktar striyaan laabh se vanchit hi rah jaati | jab striyaan dhamm ke maarg par arud hi nahin ho paati, tab stri kii urja kaa kya hota ? yah ek prashn tha, jiskaa hal nikaalnaa tha | jab stri kii urja ghamm ke maarg par nahin bahati, tab uski urja sansaarik maarg par hi bahati | kyonki stri bhav pradhan he, to vah raag kaa hi taana-bana hi bun paati | purushon kaa is raag main vaasana ke rup main girnaa sahaj hi tha | to phir buddha ko aisi vyavastha kerani padi, jisase purush bhi vaasana main naa gire or stri raag ko chhodkar sankalp ke maarg par chal pade | The floor of man and woman's desires are also different
 While the form of male lust is physically extroverted and functional, the female form of lust is physically non-functional and introverted
 That is why Buddha thought it appropriate to trust a woman, rather than a man
 This is very surprising
 How can this thing be explained? Buddha's knowledge of man is amazing
 According to this arrangement, Buddha has trusted the woman and honored the woman more than the male
 Buddha has also accepted the lust of weakness of man
 ab samajho kaise ? hamaare desh main ek parampara he | kisi parivaar main do bhai hon | bada bhai ek saal hi bada he | bade bhai kii shaadi ho chuki he | shaadi hone ke baad ab chote bhai kii usee ghar main patni aa gai he | choti bahu ke aane par sabase pehle parivaar vaale kya karavaate hai ? ve saas sasur kaa parichay karavaate vakt bahu ke jeth kaa bhi parichay karavaate hai | bahu kaa jeth uske pati se keval ek varsh hi bada he, tab bhi saas sasur ke pair chune ke saath saath jeth ke bhi pair chuaate hai | yah bada ajeeb va avyavhaarik sa lagata he | aakhir isaki kya jarurat he ? is desh ke jaankaar logon ne purush kii kamajori ko andar se bhaanp liya he | is bade bhai ke man main kabhi bhi chote bhai kii patni ke prati vaasana jaagrath ho sakati he | isaliye parivaar main kuch anhoni naa ho jaye, maansik va bhaavnaatmak rup se jahaan tak sambhav ho sake ise roka janaa chaiye | Man, being male-minded, is egoistic, which he calls self-respect
 He desperately tries to save this self-respect
 When a woman touches a man's feet, gives him the status of a deity
 Then a determination is made in the man to maintain his honor
 This woman too is no longer an ordinary woman in the eyes of a man
 This too has now risen up in the eyes of this man
 The man usually looks at the woman with the eye of lust, which is in his eyes
 Falling and falling into lust both occur simultaneously
 It is more likely for a man to fall first in lust
 That is why Buddha has relied more on the woman, and has also made more rules of humility
 ab buddha kii stri ke prati drashti ko samajhnaa aasaan ho gaya he | isaliye buddha ne niyam banaaya he, ki bhikshuni jyeshtha hone par bhi apane se junior bhikshu kaa pehle abhivadan karegi | doosraa buddha ne yah niyam banaaya he ki bhikshuni kisi bhi paristhiti main bhikshu ko gaali nahin degi | bada ajeeb sa lagata he | jaise buddha ne purush bhikshu ko stri bhikshuni ko gaali va apmaan karne kii puri chhot hi de di ho | jab bhikshuni purush bhikshu ko gaali degi, tab adhik sambhaavna yah banati he ki bhikshuni, bhikshu kii nigaahan se gir jaye or use vaasana kii nigaahan se bhi dekhne lag jaye | purush vaasana main jaldi gir saktaa he | purash balaatkaar bhi kar saktaa he, isaki sambhaavna adhik he | koi stri to shaayad hi kisi purash ke saath balaatkaar kii soche | hamen vishleshan karke hi pataa chal paata he ki buddha ne stri ko kitna bharosa va sammaan diya he | buddha kii deshna samajhnaa itnaa aasaan nahin he | bada dhiraj va chitt kii shant avasthaa chaiye nishkarsh nikaalane se pehle | bagaiyr dhyaan sadhana main utre naa to "ghamm" ko samaj sakate hai, naa hi budgh ko | a woman cannot be "characterless" until the man is "characterless" ~ Gautam Buddha! sanyas lene ke baad gautam buddha ne anek kshetron kii yatra kii
 Once he went to a village
 vahaan ek stri unke paas ai or boli - You look like a prince
 kya main jaan sakati hum ki is yuvavastha main gerua vastra pahanane kaa kya kaaran he? The Buddha politely replied that - teen prashnon ke hal dhundne ke liye unhone sanyas liya
 Buddha said - hamaara yah sharir jo yuva va aakarshak he, par jaldi hi yah vruddh hoga, phir biimaar or ant main mrityu ke munh main chalaa jayega
 i have to gain knowledge about the cause of 'old age', 'sickness' and 'death'
 buddha ke vichaaro se prabhavit hokar us stri ne unhen bhojan ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Soon this thing spread throughout the village
 gaanv vaasi buddha ke paas aae va aagrah kiya ki ve is stri ke ghar bhojan karne na jaaen
 Because she is "characterless"! buddha ne gaanv ke mukhiya se poocha - Do you also believe that the woman is characterless? mukhiya ne kaha ki main shapath lekar kahata hum ki vah bure charitra vaali stri he
 You don't go to his house
 buddha ne mukhiya kaa daayan haath pakadaa or use tali bajaane ko kaha - The head said - i can't clap with one hand because meraa doosraa haath aapane pakadaa hua he
 Buddha said - Similarly, how can this woman herself be characterless? jab tak is gaanv ke purush charitraheen na hon! If all the men in the village were good then this woman would not have been like this
 isliye iske charitra ke liye yahaan ke purush jimmedaar hai

 The original history as Audichya Brahmin is found from around the year 950 AD
 gyaat hota he ki, varsh 942 i
 main mulraj solanki ne apane mamaa va tatkaaleen raja samant singh chaawda kii hatya kar anhilpur patan ke singhaasana par kabja kar liya tha
 In those days, crimes such as the murder of the ruling king and the killing of priests were considered unforgivable crimes whose punishment was self-immolation and whose refinement was possible only by the Shrimali Brahmins
 par, jab mulraj, shrimalion ke priy rahe raja samant singh kii hatya ke apradhi ke rup main kukhyat ho gaye to is jaghanya aparaadh ke parimarjan va mulraj ko raja ghoshit karne se shrimali brahmanon ne kadai se manaa kar diya
 These priest Brahmins of Gujarat, who have been associated with the Chavada kings for a long time, came from Shrimal Vividmal, located in the southern part of Rajasthan
 shrimali brahman rajya ke sarkari yaajak the
 His works included religion and justice
 unhone mulraj ko aashirwad dene or use raja ke rup main ghoshit karne se manaa kar diya tha
 By no means did they explain, money, threat etc
 had no effect on those Brahmins
 tab ek aghoshit raja ke rup main hi mulraj ne praayshchitaswarup 'rudra yajna' karne or ek vishaal rudra mandir banane kaa sankalp liya
 Even then the Shrimali Brahmins did not accept the priests
 mulraj ke aatmadah par ade yaachak shrimali brahmanon ko tab gujarat rajya ke bhavi vinaash or araajaktaa ke bare main bataaya gaya par unke upar iskaa bhi koi asar nahin padaa
 At the same time many Chavada descendants also began to claim claims to the throne
 rajya kii seemaa par dushmano ne gujarat ko jeetne ke liye apni sargharmiyaan tej kar di thi
 If the state was to be maintained then surely there was a great need for reconciliation between Moolraj and Srimalis, but Srimali priests did not favor to free Moolraj from killing even after understanding the circumstances
 antat mulraj ke mitron or mantrimandal ke sadasyon ne gopneey rup se desh ke bhinn-bhinn ilaakon se vidwaan brahmanon ko laakar basaane va unhen vah sab dene kaa nirnay liya jo abtak shrimalion ko miltaa rahaa tha
 Immediately, many parties under the leadership of Minister Madhav were sent to various important and Brahmin-dominated areas located in the plains of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers to do this work, and the scholars of the Brahmin there were tempted by the luring permanent migration and unique state patronage and order
 Convinced to come to Gujarat
 kisi bhavi sajeesh se bachane ke liye, yah bhi yah sunishchit kiya gaya ki sab brahmanon ko alag-alag sthanon se laayaa jaye
 Moolraj and his minister Madhava gave preference to the Brahmins called from Kanyakubj, the land of their forefathers, in order to reduce the supremacy of the former Shrimali Brahmins, among others
 isprakaar mulraj khud ek vaidya raja ho saktaa or nawangtuk brahman pariwaron par uski pakad bhi bani rahati
 Thus according to the plan, a large caravan of 1037 Brahmin families reached Sidhpur Patan
 abtak aghoshit raja mulraj ne kahe gaye vaadon se adhik kii suvidha dilava kar unhen sadaa ke liye apana bana liya

 atah uttar disha se aane ke kaaran or ateet ke vibhinn gotro se milakar bane brahmanon ke is bade samooh ko aadhikarik taur par sahastra audichya brahman namit kiya gaya tha
 In Sanskrit, audichya refers to the northern direction
 isprakaar gotra mul yathaavat rahaa or sthaan raja mulraj solanki dwaara pradutt, shri sthal, jo kalantar main siddhpur patan ke rup main janaa jaataa he, vahi unka sthaayee sthaan bana

 Chandragupta campaigned against the Yavanas around 323 BC
 They would have started in the beginning, but they had complete success in this campaign in 317 BC
 Or it would have been found thereafter, because in the same year the ruler of West Punjab, Kshatrap Eudemus, left India with his armies
 chandragupta ke yavanyuddh ke bare main vistaarpurvak kuch nahin kaha ja saktaa
 With this success he got the provinces of Punjab and Sindh
 chandragupta maury kaa sambhavat: mahatvapurn yuddh dhananand ke saath hua

 As a result, Seleucus made a treaty by giving Chandragupta a Yavanakumari in marriage and the provinces of Aria, Erakosia, Paropanisadai and Gedrosiya
 iske badale chandragupta ne celukas ko 500 hathi bhent kiye
 The above mentioned provinces under the rule of Chandragupta Maurya and his successors have been proved by Ashoka's bilingual article obtained from Kandahar
 is prakaar sthapit hue maitri sambandh ko sthayitv pradaan karne kii drushti se celukas na megasthnij naam kaa ek doot chandragupta ke darbar main bheja

 There is hardly any computer-platform for which c compiler is not available

 In 1960, the University of Cambridge developed a computer programming language which they named BASIC COMBINED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
 ise saamaanya bol-chaal kii bhashaa main bi kaha gaya
 The 'B' language was modified in 1972 by the computer scientist Danish Ritchie in the Bell Laboratory

 'C' can be used in both Unix operating system and DOS operating system, the difference is only of compiler

 It is specially designed to use 'C' only, so most of 'C' is used only on Unix operating system

 Only 32 words are used in it, as well as there are many other supporting programs in it, with the help of which complex functions can also be successfully done
 yah mukhyat: ganit, vigyaan evam system sambandhit kaaryo ke kaam aati he
 Only lower case letters are used when giving instructions in this language
 uparokt visheshtao ke kaaran hi ’si’ ek atyadhik lokapriy computer programing bhashaa he
 Before that we have come to know how any variable is preserved in the computer's memory
 jahaan yah char sangrakshit hota he uskaa ek nishchit pataa bhi hota he jo yah bataata he ki char kaa maan memory main kahan sangrakshit he
 This address is called pointer
 c / C++ programmen bhashaa main yah suvidha bhi hoti he ki kisi char kaa pataa gyaat kiya ja saken 
 In c / c ++ programming languages also use & to find out the variable
 jaise ki agar koi purnank char x he to x kaa pataa &x se mil jaayegaa
 Just as integers, letters, real numbers, etc
 are preserved in the variable, so does the leaf of a variable
 iske liye ek nayaa datatip hota he jo pataa sangrakshit karne ke kaam aata he jis tarah se purnank sangrakshit karne ke liye int datatype kaa upyog hota he
 Use the int * datatype to preserve the address of an integer variable
 isi tarah akshar char kaa pataa sangrakshit karne ke liye char* datatype kaa upyog karte hai
 a small example is given below in which one variable preserves the address of another variable
 yahan pehle ek purnank char x paribhaashit kiya gaya he, phir p aisa char paribhaashit kiya he jo kisi purnank kaa pataa sangrakshit karata he
 Then put the address of x in the p variable
 pataa → 0 1 2 3 4memory → 1 xxrep 4 0 111 11100101 00100110 xxrep 4 0 101 01100101 
 
 
 ↑ p = &x = 3 int x ab char ek purnank pointer p he jisamen char x kaa pataa sangrakshit he arthath p ko likhavane par x kaa pataa likhaa jaayegaa
 If we want to know what memory is written in p on that memory, then we must write a main function to use * p
 kyonki ’si’ compiler kisi bhi program ko nishpadit karnaa main function se aarambh karata he
 a file or a program cannot have more than one main function
 yah ek prayogkarta dwaara paribhaashit function he
 The main function is initialized by brackets '{'
 program sanchika ke nishpaadan ke samay ’{’ yah bataata he ki nishpaadan yahan se aarambh karnaa he
 Similarly '}' tells that execution is to end here
 ek program main main function to ek hi rahata he parantu anya function kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he

 Babies are born with a natural tendency to suckle and through this they suck milk from the nipple or from the nipple of the bottle

 As the infant grows in age, it also needs a solid diet in addition to milk, many parents choose canned baby food to supplement it, supplementing the mother's milk or milk formula

 Dharmaraja Yudhishthira, being the lord of seven Akshauhini army, agreed to fight with the Kauravas
 pehle bhagwaan shrikrishna param krodhi duryodhana ke paas doot banakar gayi
 He told King Duryodhana, the lord of eleven Akshauhini army- 'rajan! tum yudhisthir ko aadha rajya de do yaa unhen paanch hi gaanv arpit kar do; nahin to unke saath yuddh karo
 ' shrikrishna kii baat sunakar duryodhana ne kaha- 'main unhen sui kii nok ke baraabar bhoomi bhi nahin doongaa; haan, unase yuddh avashya karunga
 ' aisa kahkar vah bhagwaan shrikrishna ko bandi banane ke liye udyat ho gaya
 At that time, Lord Shri Krishna gave fear to Duryodhana in the Rajya Sabha by having a vision of his supreme evil form
 phir vidura ne apane ghar le jaakar bhagwaan kaa pujan or satkar kiya
 He then returned to Yudhishthira and said- 'maharaj! You fight with Duryodhana ' yudhisthir or duryodhana kii senaayen kurukshetra ke maidan main ja datin
 Seeing the fathers Bhishma and Acharya Drona, etc
, in their opposition, Arjuna was overcome by war, then Lord Shri Krishna said to him - "partha! Bhishma etc
 Gurujanas are not worthy of grief
 manushya kaa sharir vinashshil he, kintu aatma kaa kabhi naash nahin hota
 This soul is Parabrahma
 'main brahm hoon'- is prakaar tum us aatma ko samajho
 Follow the Kshatradharma by taking the shelter of Karmayog by remaining equal in the accomplishment and imperfection of the work
 " On the saying of Shri Krishna, Arjuna became angry and incurred war
 unhone shankhadhwani kii
 The first father in Duryodhana's army was Bhishma Senapati
 pandavon ke senapati shikhandi the
 Heavy war broke out in both of them
 bhishmasahit kaurav paksh ke yoddha us yuddh main pandav-paksh ke sainikon par prahaar karne lage or shikhandi aadi pandav- paksh ke vir kaurav-sainikon ko apane baanon kaa nishaanaa banane lage
 That war between the Kauravas and the Pandava-army looked like the devasur-sangram
 akaash main khadey hokar dekhne vaale devataaon ko vah yuddh bada anandadaayak prathit ho rahaa tha
 Bhishma fought for ten days and killed most of the Pandava army with his arrows
 dasven din arjuna ne veeravar bhishma par baanon kii badi baari vrishti kii
 Here, with the inspiration of Drupada, Shikhandi also put arrows on Bhishma like a rain-fed cloud
 donon ore ke hathisvaar, ghudsavaar, rathi or paidal ek-duusare ke baanon se maare gayi
 Bhishma's death was subject to his will
 jab pandavon ko ye samaj main aa gaya kii bhishma ke rahete wo is yuddh ko nahin jeet sakate to shrikrishna ke suzav par unhone bhishma pitamah se hi unki mrityu kaa upaay poocha
 unhone kaha ki jab tak mere haath main shastr he tab tak mahadev ke atirikt mujhe koi nahin haraa saktaa
 unhone ne hi pandavon ko suzav diya ki shikhandi ko saamne karke yuddh lade
 wo jaanate the ki shikhandi purv janm main amba thi isliye wo use kanya hi maanate the
 In the 10th day of the war, Arjuna placed Shikhandi on his chariot
 Looking at Shikhandi, Bhishma gave up his bow
 unke shastr tyaagane ke baad arjuna ne unhen baano ki shayya par sula diya
 He began to spend time meditating and praising Lord Vishnu waiting for Uttarayana
 bhishma ke baan-shayya par gir jane ke baad jab duryodhana shok se vyakul ho uthaa, tab acharya dron ne senapatitv kaa bhaar grahan kiya

 It was said in this act that on 15 August 1947, two autonomous investments will be made called the Dominion of India and Pakistan and the British Government will hand over power to them

45 karod sharnaarthiyon ne apana ghar-baar chhodkar bahumat sampradaay vaale desh main sharan lee
 The British rulers of India always followed the policy of "divide and rule" in India
 unhone bharat ke nagarikon ko sampradaay ke anusaar alag-alag samoohon main baant kar rakhaa
 Some of his policies discriminated against Hindus and some against Muslims
 20veen sadi aate-aate musalmaan hinduon ke bahumat se darane lage or hinduon ko lagane laga ki british sarkaar or bhartiya netaa musalamaanon ko visheshadhikaar dene or hinduon ke prati bhedbhaav karne main lage hai
 Therefore, when the spirit of independence began to emerge in India, the leaders of both sects were competing in controlling the freedom struggle
 san 1906 main dhaka main bahut se musalmaan netaaon ne milakar muslim lig kii sthapana kii
 These leaders were of the view that Muslims had less rights than majority Hindus and that the Indian National Congress represented Hindus
 muslim lig ne alag-alag samay par alag-alag maangen rakhin
 In a speech by the famous Urdu poet Muhammad Iqbal at the conference of the Muslim League in 1930, for the first time raised the demand for a separate state for Muslims
 1935 main sindh praant kii vidhaan sabha ne bhi yahi maang uthaai
 Iqbal and Maulana Muhammad Ali Jauhar asked Muhammad Ali Jinnah to support this demand
 is samay tak jinna hindu-muslim ekta ke paksh main lagate the, lekin dhire-dhire unhone aarope lagaana shuru kar diya ki congressi netaa musalamaanon ke hiton par dhyaan nahin de rahe
 At the 1940 Muslim League Conference in Lahore, Jinnah clearly stated that he wanted two different nations
 hindu mahasabha jaise hindu sanghathan bharat ke bantwaare ke prabal virdohi the, lekin maanate the ki hinduon or musalamaanon main matbhed hai
 In a speech at the conference of Hindu Mahasabha in Allahabad in 1937, Veer Savarkar said - India is not a nation today, there are two nations here - Hindu and Muslim
 congress ke adhiktar netaa panth-nirpeksh the or sampradaay ke aadhaar par bharat kaa vibhaajan karne ke viruddh the
 Mahatma Gandhi believed that Hindus and Muslims could live together and they should live together
 unhone vibhaajan kaa ghor virodh kiya: "meri puri aatma is vichaar ke viruddh vidroh karti he ki hindu or musalmaan do virdohi mat or samskritiyaan hai
 To approve such a doctrine is like rejecting God for me
 " bahut saalon tak gandhi or unke anuyaayiyon ne koshish kii ki musalmaan congress ko chhod kar na jaaen or is prakriya main hindu or musalmaan garam dalon ke netaa unase bahut chidh gaye
 The British plannedly promoted suspicion of both Hindu and Muslim sects
 muslim lig ne agast 1946 main sidhi kaarywahi diwas manaaya or kalakatta main bheeshan dange kiye jisamen kareeb 5000 log maare gayi or bahut se ghayal hue
 In such an environment, all the leaders were under pressure to accept the partition so that the country does not come completely into a state of war
 bharat ke vibhaajan ke dhaanche ko '3 june plan' yaa mountbaton yojana kaa naam diya gaya
 The boundary between India and Pakistan was set by Sir Cyril Radcliffe, a London lawyer

 On 18 July 1947, the British Parliament passed the Indian Independence Act which finalized the process of partition
 is samay british bharat main bahut se rajya the jinke raajaaon ke saath british sarkaar ne tarah-tarah ke samjhaute kar rakhe the
 These 565 states were given the freedom to choose who they would like to join India or Pakistan
 adhiktar rajyon ne bahumat dharm ke aadhaar par desh chunaa
 There was a lot of controversy in the integration of the states whose rulers chose the country which suited the majority religion
 vibhaajan ke baad pakistan ko sanyukt raashtra main nae sadsy ke rup main shaamil kiya gaya or bharat ne british bharat kii kursi sanbhali
 The wealth of British India was shared between the two countries but this process began to drag on for too long
 gandhiji ne bharat sarkaar par dabaav daalaa ki vah pakistan ko dhan jaldi bheje jabaki is samay tak bharat or pakistan ke bich yuddh shuru ho chukaa tha or dabaav badhaane ke liye anshan shuru kar diya
 The Indian government had to succumb to this pressure and send money to Pakistan
 22 oktober 1947 ko pakistan ne kashmir par akraman kar diya, usase purv mountbaton ne bharat sarkaar se pakistan sarkaar ko 55 karod rupee kii raashi dene kaa paraamarsh diya tha
 The Union Cabinet decided to postpone giving this amount in view of the attack but at the same time Gandhi started a fast-unto-death to get this amount immediately, as a result of which this amount was given to Pakistan against the interests of India
 nathuram godse ne mahatma gandhi ke is kaam ko unki hatya karne kaa ek kaaran bataaya
 Many scholars believe that the British government did not handle the process of partition properly
 chunki swatantraaa kii ghoshnaa pehle or vibhaajan kii ghoshnaa baad main kii gayi, desh main shanti kaayam rakhane kii jimmevary bharat or pakistan kii nayi sarkaron ke sar par ai
 Nobody thought that many people would go from here

 But the new governments of the two countries did not have the necessary arrangements to deal with violence and crime
 falswaroop danga fasaad hua or bahut se logon kii jane gayi or bahut se logon ko ghar chhodkar bhaagna padaa
 It is estimated that about 5 to 3 million people died during this period, some in riots and some due to travel difficulties

 In the months following Partition, there was a massive mass transfer between the two new countries

 But in India Gandhiji pressurized the Congress and ensured that Muslims could stay in India if they wanted

 While these divisions were not only due to religious and racial reasons, it also included the strategic and political interests of Britain, on the basis of which it made its strategy at the time of the pacts and carried out partitions

 kathboli yaa slang kisi bhashaa yaa boli ke un anaupchaarik shabdon or vaakyanshon ko kehete hai jo bolne vaale kii bhashaa yaa boli main maanak to nahin maane jate lekin bolchaal main sweekaarya hote hai
 Linguists believe that puppets have always existed in every standard language, and almost everyone uses them
 aksar ek hi bhashaa samudaay ke vibhinn virgon kii apni bhinn kathboliyaan hoti hai or kisi vyakti dwaara kathboli kaa prayog uskaa kisi vishesh varg main sadsyta kaa sanket hota he
 For example, a Hindi-speaking policeman from Delhi is called 'thulla' in slang while in Mumbai she is called 'mama'
 kabhi-kabhi kathboli bahut lambe arase tak maanak bhashaa kaa bhaag na hote hue bhi prachlit rah sakati he, masalan samaaj ke kuch virgon main thanedaar yaa darogaa ke liye 'thulla' shabd kathboli ke rup main punjab kshetra ke kuch samudaayon main san 1880 main bhi prachlit paaya gaya tha
 Slang is also often used as euphemisms when the standard word for something is considered unpleasant or derogatory to hear, for example 'urine' is called 'susu' in many Hindi-speaking slang
 kabhi-kabhi yah bataanaa kathin hota he ki koi shabd maanak bhashaa kaa bhaag he yaa kathboli he
 The linguists Bethany Dumas and Jonathan Lighter listed some signs of slang for a word or phrase that slang is probably if a word has at least two of these characteristics: kathboli kisi vyavsaayik kshetra main boli jane vaali visheshgy boli se alag hoti he
 Classification is the technical terminology of a particular profession and its words meet only the second criterion from the list above, so slang cannot be called, although they can be used to keep a person outside the profession separate from the group
 
 kuch kathboliyon kaa prayog keval ek vishesh kshetra main hota he, udaharantah fiji hindi main 'kya' kii jagah kabhi-kabhi 'konchi' bolaa jaataa he, jo 'koun chiz' kaa sikuda rup he
 In contrast slang nouns are often associated with a particular subculture such as music or video games rather than territory
 phir bhi kathboli kii abhivyaktiyaan apane vaastavik kshetron se baahar jaakar "kool" or "jive" kii tarah aam taur par istemaal karne laayak ho sakati hai
 While some words eventually lose their status as slang, the use of other words continues to be treated in a similar way by most speakers
 jab kathboli mul rup se iskaa istemaal karne vaale samooh yaa up-samskruti se pare nikal jaati he to iske vaastavik upyogkarta samooh kii pahchaan ko kaayam rakhane ke liye isaki jagah duusare, kam-manyata praapt shabdon kaa prayog karne lagate hai
 One use of slang is to circumvent social prohibitions as mainstream language tries to shy away from appropriating certain realities
 isi kaaran se kathboli kii shabdaawaliyaan kuch khaas kshetra jaise ki hinsa, aparaadh, drugs or sex main vishesh rup se samrudh hai
 Alternatively, slang can only get out of familiarity with the things described
 udhaaharan ke liye californian sharaab ke kadaradaanon main se caburnet sauviganon ko aksar "cab so" ke rup main, cardone ko "card" ke rup main or isi tarah se janaa jaataa he; iskaa matlab yah he ki alag-alag sharaabon kaa namakaran iske anaavashyak prayog ko kam karata he; saath hi yah sharaab ke saath upyogkarta ke apanepan ko darshane main bhi madad karata he
 Even in a language community, slang and the extent to which it is used vary widely across social, ethnic, economic and geographic areas
 kathboli kaaphi samay ke baad prayog se baahar ho ja sakati he; haalanki kabhi-kabhi iskaa prayog adhik se adhik saamaanya ho jaataa he jab tak ki yah kuch kehane kaa ek prabhaavshaalee tarika nahin ban jaataa he, jab aam taur par ise mukhyadhara kii sweekaarya bhashaa ke rup main samajha jane lagata he, haalanki nishedhaatmak shabdon ke maamle main aisi koi abhivyakti nahin bhi ho sakati he jise mukhyadhara yaa sweekaarya bhashaa samajha jaataa ho
 Many slang words enter informal mainstream dialogue and sometimes in formal dialogue, although this can also include a change in meaning or usage
 kathboli main aksar maujuuda shabdon ke liye aupnyasik arthon kaa srijan shaamil hota he
 It is common for those novel meanings to diverge substantially from the standard meaning
 is prakaar 'kool' or 'hot' donon kaa matlab "bahut acha," "prabhaavshaalee," yaa "sundar" ho saktaa he
 Slang words are often known to be used only within a group or intergroup
 udhaaharan ke liye lit mul rup se keval kuch vishesh internet up-samskritiyon jaise ki pataakhon or online video gamers ke bich lokapriy the
 However, during the 1990s and in the early 21st century, lit has begun to take more and more common space on the Internet and has now spread beyond Internet-based dialogue and conversational languages
 kathboli ke anya prakaaron main shaamil hai mobile phone par istemaal hone vaali esemes kii bhashaa or "chatspea," ", jo "jor se hansane" yaa "joardaar hansee" yaa aroefel, "hansate-hansate jameen par lot janaa" kaa ek vipareet arth he), jiskaa istemaal internet par twarit samvaad bhejne ke liye vyapak rup se kiya jaataa he
 Some linguists make a distinction between the use of slang and the use of slang
 ghilad jukarman ke anusaar "kathboli kaa sandarbh ek vishisht saamaajik samooh, udhaaharan ke liye kishoron, sainikon, kaidiyon or choron dwaara istemaal kiye jane vaale anaupchaarik shabdic samagriyon se he
 Slang is not the kind of colloquial language that is an informal, easy dialect used by the speaker on some occasion; Which may include words such as "yours" and the use of other colloquial words
 The use of common colloquial is a lexical material used in informal dialect whereas in the broad sense "colloquial" terminology may include slang use, not in its narrow sense
 kathboli kaa prayog aksar bolchaal kii bhashaa main kiya jaataa he lekin sabhi bolchaal kii bhashaayen kathboli nahin hoti hai
 One way to do between slang and colloquial language is to ask if most local speakers understand the term; If they do, then it is a colloquial language
 haalanki samasya yah he ki yah ek alag, pramaathran pranali nahin he balki ek nirantarata kii pranali he
 However, most slang are short-lived and often used by newcomers, some of which achieve non-slang colloquial status as 'bliss, fortune' and the first name of a Jewish woman, Zelda) and even a formal position "
 kathboli ko kai bhashaaon main 'slang' kaha jaataa haibhashavaigyanikon ko is shabd kii jaden abhi gyaat nahin hai
 It is related to the khubhasa of thieves, and its earliest authentic use is "the vocabulary of inferior or non-eminent people, though other than that its origin is not clear

 This story is the story of Raj Batra, a businessman living in Delhi, who keeps on trading clothes used in marriage in Delhi
 vah amir rahata he, lekin acchhee tarah angreji nahin jaanate rahata he or uski patni donon sarkari vidhyalay main hindi madhyam main padhai kiye rahete hai
 His wife wishes that her daughter Piya should be taught in a big school and hence they wanted her to study in one of the five largest schools in Delhi
 ve log pehle dilli grammer skool gaye, jahaan shart ye thi ki keval unhen hi liya jayega, jo vidhyalay ke 3 kilometre kii duuri ke andar hi rahete hon
 For this reason, they come to live in Vasant Vihar
 raaj ko apane pita kaa ghar chhodte hue bahut dukh ho rahaa tha
 He later learns that there is a parent examination for admission
 vahaan jab raaj se sawaal kiya jaataa he to vah thik se uttar nahin de paata he is kaaran uski beti ko pravesh nahin diya gaya
 After that Raj tries his best to get his daughter into 'nature', but despite all his efforts, his daughter is not able to enter
 uske baad raaj thak haar kar ghar aata he or aaraam karte rahata he, tabhi ek karmchaaree mithai baantate hue aata he or bolta he ki uski beti kaa 'prakruti' main pravesh ho gaya he
 Raj Out Meeta is surprised to hear both of them
 un donon ko vishwaas nahin hota he ki ek kam kamaane vaala kam shikshit vyakti apni beti kaa 'prakruti' vidhyalay main pravesh kara saktaa he
 By asking him, he tells that his daughter has been entered from the quota of 'right to Education'
 raaj bhi apni beti kaa pravesh usee cote se 'prakruti' main kara detaa he
 At first they are both surprised, but later they find out that a couple of children usually leave there because of pressure or social discrimination
 ek vyakti unhen bataata he ki wo sabhi jaali dastavejon ko taiyaar kar saktaa he or aisa bhi kar saktaa he ki lottery main uski beti kaa naam aa jaye
 Those people give money to that person and he does the whole work
 lekin tabhi shiksha kaa adhikaar kota dwaara pravesh cond kaa khulaasa ho jaataa he
 In which it is said that how rich people are entering their children by giving bribe by this quota
 iske baad wo donon dar jate hai
 Now the only option left to them is to start living in the same place as the people in the fake document
 apane naye awaas main rahane main unhen mushkil lag rahaa tha, kyonki usamen na pani kii vyavastha thi or na hi ghar main shauchalay tha
 He was also facing trouble for basic amenities
 vahaan unke padosi shyaam prasad or uski patni tulsi unki kai tarah se sahaayta karte the, jaise rashan saajha karnaa yaa piya kaa khyaal rakhana aadi
 One day the teachers of Delhi Grammar School come there and keep collecting information about them
 un logon ko sabhi cheez thik lagata he lekin unhen parvesh ke liye tution kaa 24,000 rupee dena hoga, kyonki yah shiksha ke adhikaar vaale cote main nahin aata he
 Raj agrees with Asani but Shyam becomes a little worried about how Raj will be able to arrange so much money
 donon ke madhya thodi bahes hoti he par raaj bol detaa he ki wo paise kaa intjaam kar legaa
 Raj sneaks out of the house late at night to withdraw money from the ATM
 shyaam use dekh letaa he, use lagata he ki raaj bahut niraash he or wo uske paas aa jaataa he
 When Shyam keeps crossing the road, a car hits him
 shyaam ko zyada chot nahin aati he lekin khun kaaphi nikalataa he
 Raj gets very angry at the carman and talks to the police
 gaadi chalaane vaala dar jaataa he or paise de kar maamle ko dabaane kii koshish karata he
 Raj quickly takes Shyam to the hospital and then Shyam gives him 20,000 rupees, so that he can fill the amount spent in Piya's tuition
 raaj ko ye lagata he ki shyaam ne jaanbujh kar apni jindagi ko khatre main daal kar piya ke liye paise jutaye hai
 When Raj asks him why you did this, Shyam says that the life of a poor person is his only asset
 ant main pataa chalata he ki 10 pariwaron ne shiksha kaa adhikaar kota dwaara dhokhadhadi dwaara pravesh liya he
 After this all of them are canceled and re-entered by lottery
 jisamen piya ko bhi pravesh mil jaataa he
 Raj and his family return to Vasant Vihar
 raaj ko abhi tak vishwaas nahin hota he ki ek garib vyakti ne apane jivan ko sankat main daal kar piya ke pravesh hetu paise kii vyavastha kii thi
 He was equally blaming himself as his daughter Piya got admission while Shyam's son, Mohan, could not
 raaj ko lagata he ki piya ko milane vaala pravesh mohan ko milanaa chahie tha
 At the same time, he realizes his mistake and goes to the school where Shyam keeps studying and donates enough money so that new books can come there
 shyaam us vyakti se milanaa chaahate rahata he, jo us vidhyalay ko paise kaa daan kiya he
 But when he comes to know the truth, he says that i want my right not charity
 raaj iske baad vidhyalay ke praachaarya se miltaa he or piya kaa pravesh radd karwaata he
 When Mita opposes this, Raj says that before becoming a good father and husband she has to become a good person
 baad main raaj or mita hindi madhyam ke ek sarkari vidhyalay main apni beti ko badhaate hai, jahaan mohan pard rahaa tha
