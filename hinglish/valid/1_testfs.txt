 Our entire education system first reads the text of English and later we teach them Hindi
 iskaa ek aasaan sa upaay yah he ki shiksha vyavastha main ek aisi vyavastha ho, jo sabhi samasyaon kaa samaadhaan kar paae
 Education through Hindi shows its effective solution
 isse doharaa phayda hone kii sambhaavna he
 One, if the courses are made available in Hindi, then the subjects of education, medicine, agriculture, commerce, computer, law, technology, etc
, which are considered quite complex, can be easily understood, on the other hand they are given through Hindi medium
 Due to studies, it can also save time
 jaise-jis paathyakram ko chaar yaa chha: varsh lagaten he use do yaa chaar varshon main hi puraa kiya ja saktaa he
 At the same time, the help of the English who understand English will also be met

 Students who go abroad for good opportunities only, for such 1 to 5 percent of children, the burden of the ghost of English can be removed with the help of those 95 to 99 percent students
 hamaare desh ke gramin kshetron ke kuch medhaavi vidhyaarthee to keval isliye padhai chod dete he, kyonki ve angreji se tang aa gayi hote he
 He is interested in the subject, but due to lack of assessment only, there are cases of many children dropping out
 bharat jaise krishi pradhan desh main yadi krishi shaastra kii padhai hindi main uplabdh ho, to uskaa phayda lakhon kisaanon ke bacchon ko hoga
 The second measure is also - Official Hindi or Purposeful Hindi should be made compulsory so that students become familiar with the language policy of India at school and college level
 unhen hindi main sarkari kaamkaaj main prayog main aanevaali shabdaawalee, vaakyansh, noting-drafting, computer par hindi main praaroop likhane, i-mail bhejnaa, soshal media par hindi kaa prayog aadi kaa abhyaas karavaaya gaya, to isse sarkari naukari praapt karte hi hindi main kaary karne main aasaani hogi
 The education department should also consider this
 in sabhi baton par gaur karen to rajbhasha niti ke karyanvayan kii aavashyaktaa sarkari karyaalayon ke sthaan par bharat kii shiksha vyavastha main hona paramaavashyak he, kyonki shiksha niti hi vah sthaan he jahaan desh ke anya nitiyon kii niv hoti he
 Just as the foundation of a big building determines its strength, similarly the foundation of the country's system is its education system

 Instead, the people of this community believe that the tradition of Nabuat is not stagnant but is continuing
 ahmadiya sampradaay ke laag apane vartmaan sarvocch dharmaguru ko nabi ke rup main hi maanate hai
 People of other Muslim communities collectively oppose this community from time to time for this main point and repeatedly try to instruct them that the Ahmadiyya community should not declare themselves a community associated with Islam
 And the members of this community must not call themselves Muslims

 In addition to practical difficulties in validating these rules, there are some logical hurdles too, which make this situation corrupt or flawed
 in kathinaaiyon kaa parihaar kiya ja saktaa he, yadi ham doosraa drushtikon apnaayen
 According to the above view, kinetics is pure abstract science, whose entire rules can be deduced from some basic ideas
 bal vah prabhaav he jo kisi pind main twaran utpann karata he
 The state of motion of an object changes due to the application of force
 sadish rup main: Near Earth's surface: teen pindon kii gatiki samasya kii jatilta kaa abhas tab hua jab san 1743-50 main aalexi clero ne surya or prithvi ke aakarshan ke vasheebhoot chandramaa kii gati par apni khojein kii or 18 veen shatabdi ke mahan ganitagya grahon kii kshubdh gatiyon or chadra siddhant kii gaveshna main bahut samay tak jute rahe
 This led to the development of larger disciplines such as analytical kinetics, which now include ballistics, astronomical biology, particle dynamics, rigorous kinetics and vibrational theory

 When Newton applied his laws of motion to this idea, equations were found that contained only locomotives and revealed that each body moves at a uniform velocity before and after composition
 is vishay main yah saralakaari kalpana he ki kam se kam ek pind anya pindon main se ek kii apeksha itnaa chota he ki use dravyabindu, arthath kan, mana ja saktaa he

 vah congress party kii vichaardhaara kaa samarthan karte hai
 They are married prasav kaa arth hota he janan yaa bachche ko janm dena
 The birth of a child without any interruption after the completion of the prescribed period of pregnancy is called a simple and simple birth
 bachche ke janm ko dhyaan se dekhne par yah mahasoos hota he ki bachche ke janm lene kii vidhi ko ham teen bhaagon main baant sakate hai
 In the first part, the mouth of the cervix is opened and spread, in the second part the head is visible in the child and the third part in which the ovule comes out
 pratham bhaag bachche ke janm kaa pratham charan lagbhag 10 se 12 ghante yaa adhik samay kaa hota he
 The timing of the first stage depends on which child the woman has
 pehle bachche main yah charan adhik samay letaa he
 It takes less time in the second child and less time in the third child
 pratham charan main yoni kii deevaaron kaa patala hona, failana, khinchnaa or dhire-dhire karke bachche ke sir kaa khisakna hota he
 The stretched and stretched part of the vagina helps the cervix to come forward slowly
 is charan ke saath hi ek chikna padaarth bhi nikalataa he jo ki ek jhilli ke samaan hota he jisko sho kehete hai
 Sometimes the amniotic sac bursts simultaneously with sukuchan and amniotic fluid starts coming out
 doosraa bhaag bachche ke janm ke duusare charan main bachchedani kaa dabaav prayek do-do minute baad hota he tathaa aadhe yaa ek minute tak rahata he
 Due to this pressure, the child is slowly pushed down
 is charan main bachche kaa sir dekha ja saktaa he
 After this, the vagina gradually folds one layer over the other in the form of folds
 saadharantaya bachche kaa sir upar kii ore tathaa uskaa dhad neeche kii ore hota he
 Sometimes, the child is pressed with light hands from the stomach to remove the child with pain
 is charan main mahila ko lambi saans kaa vyaayaam laabhakaari hota he
 Because the woman has to exert pressure by stopping the breath
 kai baar bacchon ko nikaalane ke liye aujaaron kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 When the baby is born, when the baby comes out, the mother feels as if stool is coming out of their body
 prasav ke samay sabase pehle bachche kaa sir bahar aata he
 Then one shoulder, the other shoulder and later the entire torso comes out, the second phase is completed after the birth of such a child
 bachche ke janm lene ke baad sarvapratham bachche ke munh or naak ko saaf kiya jaataa he kabhi-kabhi bachche ke munh or saans kii nalika se chikne padaarth va anya dravon ko saaf karne ke liye mashin kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 After this, wrap the baby in a clean cloth so that the body temperature of the child is maintained
 janm ne baad bachche ke ankhon kii safai bhi aavashyak hoti he
 After the child is born, the child's breathing functionality, heartbeat, skin color, shaking and touching of the hands and feet are seen
 isko appegar kehete hai
 If the performance of the child is normal, after looking at the hands, feet, ears, excreta and back of the child, cleaning of the stomach of the child is done and obstruction of the food pipe is seen
 bachche ke janm kaa teesraa charan bachche ke janm hone se auval ko baahar aane ko teesraa charan kehete hai
 After the birth of a child, the child is connected to a pulse which is called a pulse
 yah safed, matamaila or rassi ke samaan akruti kaa hota he
 The heartbeat of its child can be felt
 yah bachche ko rakt or oxygen paryaatp maatra main pahunchaaya rahata he
 On the other hand, this pulse is attached to the oval, which is sticking to the wall of the mother's uterus, when the baby starts crying on the right side and its color turns pink, it means that the baby's heart and lungs start functioning
 In this stage, the pulse is cut at a distance of about 8 to 10 cm from the navel of the child by clamping it
 naad ko katkar yah dekhen ki yah jameen yaa kisi anya cheez se chhu na jaae kyonki yah sheeghra hi rog ko pakad letaa he or usase bachche ko rog ho saktaa he
 Therefore, after cutting it, it is advisable to put it on the stomach of the child, any medicine can also be applied on the cuticle of the child
 bachche kii kati hui naad 24 ghante ke andar dhire-dhire karke suukh jaati he
 In about 7 to 10 days, it dries and separates from the body and instead a button-shaped stain remains on the body, which is called the navel
 jab tak yah sharir par rahata he isaki dekharekh aavashyak hoti he
 It should be cleaned twice a day with the help of spirit with medical cotton and use of disinfectant medicine
 emniotic jhilli ke faadane ke baad yah naad baccha paidaa hone se pehle kai baar baahar nikal jaati he
 This condition suggests that the child is small, physical errors according to his time, the abnormal state of the baby in the womb or the excessive cause of amniotic fluid in the uterus
 bhaga se naad ke baahar aane par naad main rakt kaa bahaav kam hone lagata he bachche ke sir kaa dabaav tathaa maa ke kuulhe kii bich kii hadidyon ke bich naad par lagaataar dabaav padane ke kaaran kai baar rakt kaa sanchaar bilkul hi band ho jaataa he
 At this stage, the child dies in the womb due to low temperature and blood of the child
 isi kaaran is avasthaa main prasav kaa sheeghra karnaa yaa aaparishan ke dwaara prasav karana laabhadaayak hota he
 Many times this type of pulse is not known in the beginning
 is avasthaa ko maaloom karne ke liye bhaga dwaara jaanch kerani padati he
 In this case, childbirth does not happen quickly and the heartbeat of the child starts decreasing
 is kaaran yah aavashyak he ki jaise hi emnyotic jhilli fatati he
 At that time, the investigation of the woman should be done soon by breach
 aisi striyaan jinamein bachche kaa sir kuulhe par aakar na tikaa ho unamem naad kaa baahar aane kii sambhaavn bhi adhik hoti he or kuch samay baad yah swayan sookhkar gir jaati he tathaa bachche kii naabhi kaa nishaan jeevanaparyant ke liye rah jaataa he
 As soon as the baby's head comes out at the time of the birth of the child, it should be noted how much lubricated fluid is applied on the child's face because this lubricated fluid can make the baby difficult to breathe
 isi kaaran ek saaf kapade ke tukade dwaara bachche kaa cheharaa, naak or munh ko acchhee prakaar se saaf karnaa chahie
 The child can be hung upside down as soon as the baby is born
 jiske kaaran fefde aadi main gaya hua chikna drav munh main lautakar aa jaae or munh kaa drav fefdon main na ja paye
 For this reason it can be removed carefully by suction
 thodi si maatra main chiknayeeyukt drav fefdon main ja saktaa he
 But the baby's cry is not cured due to excessive amount of fluid going into the lungs
 aisi sthiti mren fefde main nalee daalkar ise nikaalnaa padataa he tathaa bachche ko davaaiyaan bhi shuru kerani padati he
 The first child's lungs are like a balloon without air
 parantu pehali baar saans lete hi fefde hawa se bhar jate hai
 Blood starts coming out of it and oxygenated blood reaches the child's heart from the lungs
 is avasthaa main bachche kaa hriday sheeghra hi kaary karne lagata he
 Meanwhile, the child's relationship is separated from the Oval
 bachchedani main kuch dard ke saath auval bhi dhire-dhire bachchedani kii deevaaron kii pakad ko chhodane lagati he tathaa dhire-dhire karke puraa auval alag hokar isi dwaar se baahar aa jaati he
 Sometimes it may take 10 minutes to half an hour for the oval to come, in such a situation, a mild massage of the mother's abdomen may also have to be done
 yadi iske baad bhi auval baahar nahin aata he to use ritand auval kehete hai
 As soon as Oval comes out, Oval should be seen properly
 yadi auval kaa ek bhi tukdaa nahin aa paaya to phir bachchedani puri taraf se sikud nahin paati tathaa raktasrav hota rahata he
 The child becomes somewhat blue as soon as the child is born
 parantu bachche ke rone se aksigen or rakt bachche ke sharir main sancharit hone lagata he
 Due to this, the color of the child becomes pink
 bachche ke sharir par safed chiknaiyukt padaarth laga rahata he
 This greasy material is called varnix
 bachche ko saaf kapade se ponchney yaa bachche ko snaan karaane se yah chiknayeeyukt drav sharir se baahar aa jaataa he
 There is some swelling on the face of the child, eye shadow and some part of the child's head is visible, which is called caput
 yah sab samay ke saath thik ho jaataa he
 The muscles that are thrust on the head when the baby is born
 usase caput ban jaataa he
 But it resolves within a few days
 bachche ke janm ke samay bachche kii chaati kuch badi hui hoti he
 If there is a girl in delivery
 to uske mutradwar ke donon ore kii twachaa lebia kuch adhik bhuri or suji hui hoti he or kuch bhaag baahar nikalataa dikhaai detaa he
 Sometimes a little blood also comes, similarly in the boy, the enlargement of the testicles or the appearance of some light blue and brown color are common things which change according to the time

 Solid fuel made from coke coal
 yah kam raakh vaale, kam sulfaryukt, bituminas koyale ke prabhanjak aswan se praapt hota he
 Not all types of coal are suitable for coke
 jo koyala garam karne se komal ho jaae or phir newnaadhik thos pind main badal jaae use coke bananevaala koyala kaha jaataa he
 a coal that is crushed or stung weakly by heating, is considered unsuitable for coal coke
 achche coke kaa bananaa koyale kii koshikaon, usamen upasthit gandhak evam raakh kii maatra, bhatthi ke taap tathaa anya paristhitiyon aadi par nirbhar karata he
 Sometimes mixing different types of coals and heating them makes good coke
 uttam coke bananevaale koyale main vibhinn avyavon kii maatra is prakaar honi chahie : Water does not exceed 4 percent; raakh kii maatra sookhe koyale ke bhaar kaa nau pratishat se adhik na rahe; Coke is made with different purposes
 kuch coke dhaatuon ke nirmaan ke liye, kuch gaison ke nirmaan ke liye or kuch jalaavan ke liye banaae jate he
 The first two types of coke are called hard coke and the third type of coke is called semi coke or soft coke
 kathor coke kuch baari tathaa saghan hota he
 He does not catch fire soon
 iskaa vyavhaar gharelu irdhann ke liye nahin hota
 This primacy is used in the manufacture of metals and gases
 ardh coke yaa mridu coke apekshaya halkaa or sardhraan hota he tathaa sheeghra aag pakad letaa he
 It also gives less smoke than raw coal
 is kaaran gharelu irdhann ke liye yah adhik upyukt hota he
 To make coke, the coal is heated in different containers or in different types of stoves or furnaces at different temperatures
 is prakaar koyale ke garam karne ko koyale kaa carbonikaran kehete hai
 It is also called distillation of coal
 yadi carbonikaran kaa taap 100 sein, 1,300 sens0 he to ise ucchataap carbonikaran, yadi taap 700 se 900 sein0 he to ise madhyataap carbonikaran or yadi taap 550 sein0 se neeche taap par koyale kaa vichchhedan nahin hota
 High Coat Carbonization provides hard coke, and Mid and Low Carbonization gives half coke or soft coke
 coke banane kii pratha 300 varshon se adhik pracheen he
 In ancient times, he used to heat large pieces of coal in a pile in the same way as he used to make wood pile in making charcoal
 koyale ke dher ke bich ek chhed hota tha, jo chimney kaa kaam karata tha
 They used to cover the pile of coal with fire and burnt it with fire from below
 kuch koyale ke jalane se ooshmaa hoti thi, jisase shesh koyala garam hokar coke banataa tha
 Thus it took about 10 days to make coke
 coke ban jane par pani se dher ko bujhaakar coke praapt karte the
 Some coal was burnt in it
 18veen shatabdi ke madhya main it ke bane chulhon main coke banane kaa kaam aarambh hua
 The shape of such stoves was like a bee
 isse is chuulhe kaa naam madhumakhi chhata chulhaa padaa
 This name is still practiced till date
 peeche unnat prakaar ke aise chuulhe bane jinaki gach par 2 3 foot motaa koyala rakhkar garam kiya jaataa tha
 It often took 72 hours to make coke from such stoves
 is reeti main bhi kuch koyala jalakar nasht ho jaataa tha or coke bhi kam maatra main banati thi or carbonikaran ke saare upjaat nasht ho jate the
 There was no arrangement to get them
 aajkal aise chuulhe bane hai jinamein koyala baahar se garam kiya jaataa he or sab upjaat nasht hone se bachaa liye jate hai
 Modern methods of making coke have the practice of chambers made of bhabhake or agnimitti
 bhabhake pehle lohe ke banate the or keval 800 sein
 tak hi garam kiye ja sakate the
 Life would be of few months without being so hot
 peeche agnimitti ke bhabhake banane lage
 It is 950 cm Could be heated
 ab agni sah iton ke bane chuulhe yaa kakshon main 1,400 sein
 tak taap saralata se mil jaataa he
 The fissures used to make coke can be horizontal or vertical
 kshaitij bhabhake silica ke athwa silikamay agni mitti ke banate hai
 These are typically 20 feet long and 23 inches by 19 inch semi oval
 inamen ek nal laga rahata he jisase vashpashil ansh baahar nikalataa he
 There are many lines of bhabhake and several categories of rows
 bhabhaka utpadaitr gas se garam hota he
 After the carbonization is complete, remove the hot coke and extinguish it with water
 koyale kaa carbonikaran urdhwadhar bhabhake yaa kaksh chuulhe main bhi hota he
 The stove is rectangular
 or isamen ek baar paanch ton koyale kaa carbonikaran ho saktaa he
 The chamber is made of silica
 yah bhi utpaadit gas se garam hota he
 Coal is poured from the top and coke comes out of the bottom
 carbonikaran puraa hone main lagbhag 12 ghanta lagata he
 This Bhabhaka is of all types
 urdhwadhar bhabhake aviraam kism ke bhi hote hai
 They are rectangular or oval
 inamen ek baar main 10 ton koyale kaa carbonikaran ho saktaa he
 Coal falls from above and comes to the end, resulting in coke
 coke ko sheetak kaksh main bhaap se bujhaate hai
 Bhabhaka is heated by producer gas
 sanyannn aisa bana rahata he ki coke banane kaa kaam aviraam kam se chalata rahe
 Once coke is formed it needs to be extinguished
 ise coke kaa shaman kehete hai
 This work is done in shamanayan made of bricks
 bujhaate samay jo bhaap banati he vah upar se nikal jaati he
 Water comes from the water tank and falls on the coke
 saadharantaya coke kaa taap 1,000 sein0 rahata he
 The steam produced in the process of extinguishing per ton of coke is destroyed by a million British-calorific quantities of heat
 is ooshmaa kii pun: prapti kii cheshtaayen hui hai
 In one such effort, Shamanayan takes the coke to a closed chamber
 us kaksh kaa dwaar bandakar usamen vaayu pravisht karaate hai
 Then he takes it in the boiler tube and takes it to Shamanayan again and again
 vaayu kaa oxijan carbondioxide or carbonamonocsaide main parinat ho jaataa he
 Inert gases of air remain
 aisi vaayu ko tab tak yaan main le jate hai jabatak uskaa taap girakar 250 sein
 tak nahin ho jaataa
 The amount of water in such coke is less
 at: yah coke vatabhatthiyon ke liye acha hota he
 The cost of setting up such a dry extinguishing plant is slightly more
 coke banane ke sanyantr anek companiyon ke he
 They all have their own specialties
 coke banane ke sanyantr main nimnilikhit bate dhyatavya hai 1
 Coke should be of good quality and same
 2
 coke ke nirmaan main kam se kam eendhan lage
 3
 Minimum loss of volatile fraction in the plant
 4
 sanyantr aisa ho ki aavashyaktaa padane par marammat saralata se kii ja sake
 5
 Its stove should be such that if one stove becomes useless then the work of other stoves should not stop
 bhinn-bhinn bhabhakon yaa chulhon main bane coke kii prakruti ek si nahin hoti
 It depends on the nature of coal, the manner of carbonic run and the temperature of carbonization
 chaar vibhinn vidhiyon se praapt coke ke vishleshan ank is prakaar paae gaye he: Bee Hive Stove - Bhabhaka Coke Stove - Vertical Furnace - Horizontal Furnace sthir carbon 92

 bharat ke uparashtrapati rajyasabha ke sabhapati hote hai
 The first session of Rajya Sabha was held on 13 May 1952
 rajya sabha ek aisa naam he jisaki ghoshnaa sabhapith dwaara sabha main 23 agast 1954 ko kii gai thi
 It has its own special features
 bharat main dwitiya sadan kaa prarambh 1918 ke monteg-chamsford prativedan se hua
 The Government of India Act, 1919 provided for the creation of the Council of States as the second house of the then Legislature, with limited privileges and which actually came into existence in 1921
 governor-general tatkaaleen council of stats kaa paden adhyaksh hota tha
 Hardly any changes were made to its formation through the Government of India Act, 1935
 samvidhan sabha, jisaki pehali baithak 9 disambar 1946 ko hui thi, ne bhi 1950 tak kendriya vidhanmandal ke rup main kaary kiya, phir ise 'anantim sansad' ke rup main parivartit kar diya gaya
 During this period, the Central Legislature, called the 'constituent Assembly' and later the 'provisional Parliament', remained unicameral until the first elections were held in 1952
 swatantra bharat main dwitiya sadan kii upyogita athwa anupayogita ke sambandh main samvidhan sabha main vistrut bahes hui or antat: swatantra bharat ke liye ek dwisadani vidhanmandal banane kaa nirnay mukhya rup se isliye kiya gaya kyonki parisangheey pranali ko apaar vividhtaon vaale itane vishaal desh ke liye sarvaadhik sahaj swaroop kii sarkaar mana gaya
 In fact, a directly elected single assembly was deemed insufficient to meet the challenges facing independent India
 at:, 'council of stats' ke rup main gyaat ek aise dwitiya sadan kaa srijan kiya gaya jisaki sanrachana or nirvachan paddati pratyaksht: nirvaachit lok sabha se purnat: bhinn thi
 It was deemed to be another House whose membership is less than the Lok Sabha
 iskaa aashay parisangheey sadan arthath ek aisi sabha se tha jiskaa nirvachan rajyon or do sangh rajya kshetron kii sabhaaon ke nirvaachit sadasyon dwaara kiya gaya, jinamein rajyon ko samaan pratinidhitiv nahin diya gaya
 Apart from the elected members, the President also nominated twelve members for the assembly
 isaki sadsyta hetu nunatam aayu tees varsh niyat kii gai jabaki nichle sadan ke liye yah pachchis varsh he
 Elements of dignity and prestige were added to the Council of States meeting
 aisa bharat ke uparashtrapati ko rajya sabha kaa paden sabhapati banaakar kiya gaya, jo isaki baithkon kaa sabhapatitv karte hai
 Article 80 of the constitution prescribes a maximum strength of 250 members of the Rajya Sabha, out of which 12 members are nominated by the President and 238 are the representatives of the Member States and the Union Territories
 tathaapi, rajya sabha ke sadasyon kii vartmaan sankhya 245 he, jinamein se 233 sadsy rajyon or sangh rajyashetra dilli tathaa puducheri ke pratinidhi hai or 12 raashtrapati dwaara namanirdeshit hai

 rajyon ke punargathan tathaa nae rajyon ke gathan ke parinamswaroop, rajyon or sangh rajya kshetron ko aavantit rajya sabha main nirvaachit sthanon kii sankhya varsh 1952 se lekar ab tak samay-samay par badalati rahi he

 Explanation
 — For the purposes of this section, no person shall be deemed to hold the office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of a State merely because he is a Union or a Minister of such State
 iske atirikt, samvidhan kii dasvin anusuchee main dal-parivartan ke aadhaar par sadasyon kii nirarhata ke bare main upbandh kiya gaya he
 According to the provisions of the Tenth Schedule, a member shall be disqualified as a member if he voluntarily relinquishes membership of his political party; Or He votes in the House against any direction given by a political party of which he is a member or continues to vote and is not waived within fifteen days by such political party

 nirdaleey ummidavaar ke rup main nirvaachit sadsy nirarhit hoga yadi vah apane nirvachan ke pashchaat kisi raajnneetik dal main sammilit ho jaataa he
 However, a nominated member of the House by the President will be allowed to join any political party if he / she does so within the first six months of assuming his / her place in the House
 kisi sadsy ko is aadhaar par nirarhit nahin kiya jayega yadi vah rajya sabha kaa up-sabhapati nirvaachit hone ke pashchaat apane raajnneetik dal kii sadsyta swechha se chhod detaa / detii he
 Representatives of States and Union Territories in the Rajya Sabha are elected by indirect electoral system
 prayek rajya tathaa do sangh rajya kshetron ke pratinidhiyon kaa nirvachan us rajya kii vidhaan sabha ke nirvaachit sadasyon tathaa us sangh rajya kshetra ke nirvaachak mandal ke sadasyon, jaisaa bhi maamla ho, dwaara ekal sankramntic mat dwaara anupatik pratinidhitiv pranali ke anusaar kiya jaataa he
 The electoral college of the Delhi National Capital Region consists of the elected members of the Delhi Legislative Assembly and the Puducherry Union Territory electorate in the Puducherry Legislative Assembly
 rajya sabha ek sthaayee sadan he or yah bhang nahin hota
 However, one-third of the members of Rajya Sabha retire after every two years
 purnakalik avadhi ke liye nirvaachit sadsy chah varshon kii avadhi ke liye kaary karata he
 An election held to fill a vacancy created otherwise than on retirement at the end of the term of a member is called a 'by-election'
 up-chunaav main nirvaachit koi sadsy us sadsy kii shesh karyavadhi tak sadsy bana rah saktaa he jisane tyaagptr de diya tha yaa jisaki mrityu ho gai thi yaa jo dasvin anusuchee ke adheen sabha kaa sadsy hone ke liye nirarhit ho gaya tha
 The Presiding Officers of Rajya Sabha have the responsibility to conduct the proceedings of the House
 bharat ke uparashtrapati rajya sabha ke paden sabhapati hai
 Unlike the members of the Rajya Sabha, the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha has a tenure of 5 years, the Rajya Sabha also elects a Deputy Chairman from among its members
 rajya sabha main upsabhadhyakshon kaa ek panel bhi hota he, jiske sadasyon kaa namanirdesan sabhapati, rajya sabha dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In the absence of the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman, a member from the panel of Deputy Speaker presides over the proceedings of the House
 lok sabha ke vipareet rajyasabha kaa sabhapati apana istipha upasabhapati ko nahin balki raashtrapati ko detaa he
 The secretary-general is appointed by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and his rank is equivalent to the highest civil servant of the Union
 mahasachiv gumnaam rah kar kaary karte hai or sansadeey maamalon par salaah dene ke liye tatparta se peethasin adhikariyon ko uplabdh rahete hai
 The secretary-general is also the administrative head of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat and the custodian of the records of the House
 vah rajya sabha ke sabhapati ke nidesh va niyantranaadhin kaary karte hai
 Under Article 75 of the Constitution, the Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha which means that the Rajya Sabha cannot form or topple the Government
 tathaapi, yah sarkaar par niyantran rakh sakati he or yah kaary vishesh rup se us samay bahut mahatvapurn ho jaataa he jab sarkaar ko rajya sabha main bahumat praapt nahin hota he
 In the case of a general legislation, to remove the deadlock between the two Houses, the Constitution provides for a joint sitting of the two Houses
 vastut:, ateet main aise teen avasar aae hai jab sansad kii sabhaaon kii unke bich matbhedon ko sulajhane ke liye sanyukt baithak hui thi
 The issues to be raised in the joint meeting are decided by a majority of the total number of members present and voting in both the Houses
 sanyukt baithak sansad bhawan ke kendriya kaksh main yojit kii jaati he jisaki adhyakshata loksabhaadhyaksh dwaara kii jaati he
 However, in the case of a Money Bill, there is no provision in the Constitution to convene a joint sitting of the two Houses, as the Lok Sabha enjoys prominence over the Rajya Sabha in financial matters
 samvidhan sanshodhan vidheyak ke sambandh main, samvidhan main yah upbandh kiya gaya he ki aise vidheyak ko donon sabhaaon dwaara, samvidhan ke anuchhed 368 ke adheen vihit rup main, vishisht bahumat se paarit kiya janaa hota he
 Therefore, there is no provision to remove the deadlock between the two Houses in relation to the Constitution Amendment Bill
 mantri sansad kii kisi bhi sabha se ho sakate hai
 The constitution does not make any distinction between the assemblies in this regard
 prayek mantri ko kisi bhi sabha main bolne or uski kaarywahi main bhaag lene kaa adhikaar hota he, lekin vah usee sabha main mat dene kaa hakdaar hota he jiskaa vah sadsy hota he
 Similarly, with respect to the powers, privileges and immunities of the Houses of Parliament, their members and their committees, the two Houses have been placed on the same level by the Constitution
 jin anya mahatvapurn vishyon ke sambandh main donon sabhaaon ko samaan shaktiyaan praapt hai ve is prakaar hai:- raashtrapati kaa nirvachan tathaa mahabhiyog, uparashtrapati kaa nirvachan, apatkaal kii udghoshnaa kaa anumodan, rajyon main sanvaidhanik tantra kii vifaltaa se sambandhit udghoshnaa or vittiya apatkaal
 In connection with receiving reports and letters from various constitutional authorities, etc
, both Houses have equal powers
 is prakaar, yah spasht he ki mantri-parishad kii samuhik jimmedaari ke maamle or kuch aise vittiya maamle, jo sirf lok sabha ke kshetradhikaar main aate hai, ke sivaae donon sabhaaon ko samaan shaktiyaan praapt hai
 The Rajya Sabha, being a federal house, has certain powers under the Constitution
 rajyasabha ke paas teen vishesh shaktiyaan hoti he All the subjects / areas related to the legislation are divided into three lists - Union List, State List and Concurrent List
 sangh or rajya suchiyaan paraspar apvarjit hai- koi bhi duusare ke kshetra main rakhe gaye vishay par kanoon nahin bana saktaa
 However, if the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting, it is "necessary or expedient in the national interest" that the Parliament certify any in the State List If the law is made on the subject, then the Parliament becomes empowered to legislate for the entire territory of India or any part of it on the subject specified in that resolution
 aisa sankalp adhiktam ek varsh kii avadhi ke liye pravrutt rahegaa parantu yah avadhi isi prakaar ke sankalp ko paarit karke ek varsh ke liye pun: badhaayi ja sakati he
 If the Rajya Sabha passes a resolution by a majority of at least two-thirds of the members present and voting, declaring that the creation of one or more All India Services for the Union and the States is in the national interest
 If necessary or expedient, Parliament by law becomes empowered to create such services
 samvidhan ke adheen, raashtrapati ko rashtriya apaat kii sthiti main, kisi rajya main sanvaidhanik tantra ke vifal ho jane kii sthiti main athwa vittiya apaat kii sthiti main udghoshnaa jari karne kaa adhikaar he
 It is mandatory for each such proclamation to be approved by both the Houses of Parliament within the stipulated period
 tathaapi, katipay paristhitiyon main rajya sabha ke paas is sambandh main vishesh shaktiyaan hai
 If a proclamation is made at a time when the Lok Sabha has been dissolved or the dissolution of the Lok Sabha takes place within the period allowed for its approval and if the resolution approving it is made by the Rajya Sabha under Articles 352, 356 and 360 If it is passed within the period specified in the constitution, then that proclamation will remain in effect
 dhan vidheyak keval lok sabha main poor:sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 After it is passed by that House, it is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha for its consent or recommendation
 aise vidheyak ke sambandh main rajya sabha kii shakti simit he
 The Rajya Sabha has to return such a bill to the Lok Sabha within fourteen days of its receipt
 yadi yah us avadhi ke bheetar lok sabha ko nahin lautaaya jaataa he to vidheyak ko ukt avadhi kii samaapti par donon sadanon dwaara us rup main paarit kiya gaya samajha jayega jisamen ise lok sabha dwaara paarit kiya gaya tha
 The Rajya Sabha cannot amend the Money Bill; It can only recommend amendments and the Lok Sabha can accept or reject all or any of the recommendations of the Rajya Sabha
 dhan vidheyak ke alaava, vitt vidheyakon kii katipay anya shreniyon ko bhi rajya sabha main poor:sthapit nahin kiya ja saktaa
 However, there are some other types of finance bills in respect of which there is no restriction on the powers of Rajya Sabha
 ye vidheyak kisi bhi sabha main prastut kiye ja sakate hai or rajya sabha ko aise vitt vidheyakon ko kisi anya vidheyak kii tarah hi asweekrut yaa sanshodhit karne kaa adhikaar he
 In fact, such bills cannot be passed by any House of Parliament unless the President has recommended to that House for consideration
 tathaapi, in sari baton se yah nishkarsh nahin nikalataa ki rajya sabha kaa vitt sambandhi maamalon se kuch bhi lenaa-dena nahin he
 The budget of the Government of India is also placed before the Rajya Sabha every year and its members discuss it
 yadhyapi rajya sabha vibhinn mantralayon kii anudaan maangon par matdaan nahin karti - yah maamla anany rup se lok sabha ke liye surakshit he phir bhi, bharat kii sanchit nidhi se kisi dhan kii nikasi tab tak nahin kii ja sakati, jab tak donon sabhaaon dwaara viniyog vidheyak ko paarit nahin kar diya jaataa
 Similarly, the Finance Bill is also brought before the Rajya Sabha
 iske alaava, vibhaag-sambandhit sansadeey sthaayee samitiyaan, jo mantralayon / vibhaagon kii vaarshik anudaan maangon kii jaanch karti hai, sanyukt samitiyaan hai jinamein das sadsy rajya sabha se hote hai
 Apart from the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman, the Leader of the House is another officer who plays an important role in the efficient and smooth conduct of the House
 rajya sabha main sabha kaa netaa saamanytah pradhan mantri hota he, yadi vah iskaa sadsy he, athwa koi aisa mantri hota he, jo is sabha kaa sadsy he or jise unke dwaara is rup main kaary karne ke liye naam-nirdisht kiya gaya ho
 Its primary responsibility is to maintain coordination among all sections of the House for amicable and meaningful debate in the House
 is prayojanarth, vah na keval sarkaar ke, balki vipaksh, mantriyon or peethasin adhikari ke bhi nikat sampark main rahata he
 He sits on the first seat in the first row to the right of the Chair in the assembly hall so that he is readily available to the Presiding Officer for consultation
 niyamon ke tahat, sabhapati dwaara sabha main sarkari kaary kii vyavastha, raashtrapati ke abhibhaashan par charchaa hetu dinon ke aavanton athwa samay ke aavanton, shuukravaar ke alaava kisi anya din ko gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon ke kaary, aniyat din vaale prastaavon par charchaa, alpakaalik charchaa or kisi dhan vidheyak par vichaar evam use waapas kiye jane ke sambandh main sadan ke netaa se paraamarsh kiya jaataa he
 In the event of the death of a great personality, national leader or a person of international repute, the Chairman may also consult him in the matter of adjournment or otherwise for the House for that day
 gathbandhan sarkaron ke yug main unka kaary or adhik chunauteepurn ho gaya he
 He ensures that all possible and appropriate facilities are provided in the House for meaningful discussion on any matter brought before the House
 vah sabha kii raay vyakt karne or ise samaaroh athwa aupchaarik avasaron par prastut karne main sabha ke vaktaa ke rup main kaary karte hai
 The following members have been the leaders of the House in Rajya Sabha: vidhayika main vipaksh ke netaa ke pad kaa atyadhik saarvajanik mahatv he
 Its importance derives from the main role given to the opposition in parliamentary democracy
 vipaksh ke netaa kaa kaary vastut: atyadhik kathin he kyonki unhen aalochana kerani padati he, galati ingit kerani padati he or aise vaikalpik prastaavon / nitiyon ko prastut karnaa padataa he jinhen lagu karne kaa unhen koi adhikaar nahin he
 Thus they have to bear a special social responsibility towards Parliament and the country
 rajya sabha main varsh 1969 tak vaastavik arth main vipaksh kaa koi netaa nahin hota tha
 Till then, it was customary to consider the leader of the opposition party with the most members as the opposition leader without giving any formal recognition, status or privileges
 vipaksh ke netaa ke pad ko sansad main vipakshi netaa vetan or bhatta adhinium, 1977 dwaara adhikarik manyata pradaan kii gai
 By this Act, the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha is a member of the Rajya Sabha who is for some time in opposition to the government of the party with the largest number of members as recognized by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha
 is prakaar vipaksh ke netaa ko teen sharten puri kerani hoti hai, namash: Uvat was a famous Veda-commentator

 Indian mathematicians and astronomers have also taken reference to it, such as Aryabhata and Varahamihira, etc
 Varahamihira mentions this in his Panchasiddhantika including four other commentaries, which are: surya siddhanth naamak varnit kaary, kai baar dhaala gaya he
 The earliest references to it are found in the Buddhist period
 vah kaary, sangrakshit karke or sampadit kiya hua madhya kaal ko sanket karata he
 Varahamihira, a tenth-century commentator, quotes six shlokas from the Surya Siddhanta, one of which is no longer found in this doctrine
