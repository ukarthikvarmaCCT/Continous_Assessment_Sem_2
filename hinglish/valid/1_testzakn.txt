 Raj Kumar, Death - 3 July 1996 Mumbai) was an Indian actor in Hindi films
 inkaa naam kulbhushan pandit tha lekin filmi duniya main ye apane duusare naam 'raaj kumaar' ke naam se prasiddh hai
 He adopted the traditional Parsi theater dialogues and this became his special identity
 inke dwaara abhinit prasiddh filmon main paigaam, vaqt, neelkamal, pakiza, maryaada, hir ranjha, saudagar aadi hai
 In the Hindi cinema world, many stars ruled the hearts of the audience due to their strong acting, but there was one such star, who was considered not only by the audience but also by the entire film industry as 'rajkumar' and he was the uncrowned king of dialogue payment Kulbhushan Pandit aka Rajkumar
 pakistan ke baluchistan praant main 8 oktober 1926 ko janme rajkumaar snaatak kii padhai puri karne ke baad mumbai ke mahim thane main sab inspector ke rup main kaam karne lage
 One day while patrolling at night, a soldier told the prince that Hazur, you are no less than a hero in color and stature
 filmon main yadi aap hero ban jaayen to lakhon dilon par raaj kar sakate hai or rajkumaar ko sipaahi kii yah baat janch gayi
 Rajkumar was employed in the police station in Mumbai
 vahaan aksar film udyog se jude logon kaa aana-janaa laga rahata tha
 Once, filmmaker Baldev Dubey came to the police station for some important work
 vah rajkumaar ke baatcheet karne ke andaaj se kaaphi prabhavit hue or unhone rajkumaar se apni film 'shahi bazaar' main abhinayta ke rup main kaam karne kii peshkash kii
 Rajkumar had already made up his mind to become an actor after listening to the soldier
 isliye unhone turant hi apni sab inspector kii naukari se istipha de diya or nirmaataa kii peshkash sweekaar kar lee
 It took a long time for the royal market to be built and the prince also found it difficult to make a living
 isliye unhone varsh 1952 me pradarshit film 'rangili' main ek choti si bhoomika sweekaar kar lee
 When did this film enter the cinema houses and when did it go away
 yah pataa hi nahin chalaa
 Meanwhile, his film 'shahi Bazaar' was also released
 jo box offis par aundhe munh giri
 After the failure of the royal market, all the relatives of Rajkumar started saying that your face is not suitable for the film
 or kuch log kehane lage ki tum khalanaayak ban sakate ho
 From 1952 to 1957, Rajkumar struggled to make a mark in the film industry
 'rangili' ke baad unhen jo bhi bhoomika mili rajkumaar use sweekaar karte chale gaye
 Meanwhile, he starred in many films like 'anmol' 'sahara', 'opportunity', 'ghamand', 'neelamani' and 'krishna Sudama' but none of these films were successful at the box office
 varsh 1957 main pradarshit mehboob khan kii film madar india main raaj kumaar gaanv ke ek kisaan kii choti si bhoomika main dikhaai die
 Though the film was entirely focused on actress Nargis, Raj Kumar managed to leave a mark of her acting in her minor role
 is film main unke damdaar abhinay ke liye unhen antarrashtriya khyaati bhi mili or film kii safalataa ke baad raaj kumaar bataur abhinayta film industry main sthapit ho gaye
 In the film 'paigaam', released in 1959, he had the acting Emperor Dilip Kumar of the Hindi film industry in front of him, but Raj Kumar also managed to rob the applause of the audience through his strong role here
 iske baad raaj kumaar 'dil apana or preet paraai-1960', 'gharaana- 1961', 'godaan- 1963', 'dil ek mandir- 1964', 'dooj kaa chand- 1964' jaisi filmon main mili kamyaabi ke zariye raaj kumaar darshako ke bich apane abhinay kii dhak jamaate hue aisi sthiti main pahunch gayi jahaan vah film main apni bhoomika swayan chun sakate the
 After the tremendous success of the film Kajal released in 1965, Raj Kumar made his own identity as an actor
 varsh 1965 bi
aar
chopra kii film vaqt main apane laajawab abhinay se vah ek baar phir se apni ore darshak kaa dhyaan aakarshith karne main safal rahe
 At the time of the film, Raj Kumar spoke a dialogue, "chinayi Seth, whose houses are made of glass, do not throw stones at others, or if Cheney Seth does not cut the hand of children playing knives, then the blood comes out" Been quite popular in the middle
 film vaqt kii kamyaabi se raaj kumaar shoharat kii buladiyon par ja pahunche
 In such a situation, when an actor comes in front of him, he starts to be arbitrary and his tendency to lose fame increases and soon he is also tied into a particular image
 lekin raaj kumaar kabhi bhi kisi khaas image main nahin bandhe isaliye apni in filmo kii kamyaabi ke baad bhi unhone 'humaraaz- 1967', 'neelkamal- 1968', 'mere hujur- 1968', 'hir ranjha- 1970' or 'pakiza- 1971' main romani bhoomika bhi sweekaar kii jo unke filmi charitra se mail nahin khaati thi iske baavjood bhi raaj kumaar yahan darshakon kaa dil jeetne main safal rahe
 In the film Karmayogi released in the year 1978, new dimensions of Raj Kumar's acting and diversity were seen by the audience
 is film main unhone do alag-alag bhoomikaaon main apane abhinay kii chhap chodi
 Raj Kumar introduced himself in various roles to avoid uniformity in acting and also to establish himself as a character actor
 is kram main varsh 1980 main pradarshit film bulandi main vah charitra bhoomika nibhaane se bhi nahin hichake or is film ke jariye bhi unhone darshako kaa man mohe rakhaa
 After this Raj Kumar followed 'kudrat - 1981', 'dharmakanta - 1982', 'sharara - 1984', 'rajatilak - 1984', 'A new Paheli - 1984', 'marte Dum Tak - 1987', 'surya - 1989' Many superhit films like 'jangbaaz- 1989', 'police Public- 1990', ruled the hearts of the viewers
 varsh 1991 main pradarshit film 'saudagar' main rajkumaar ke abhinay ke nae aayam dekhne ko mili
 In this film produced by Subhash Ghai, Rajkumar was opposite Dilip Kumar for the second time after the 1959 film 'paigam' and the confrontation between these two masters of the acting world was worth watching
 nabbe ke dashak main raaj kumaar ne filmon me kaam karnaa kaafii kam kar diya
 During this period, films like Raj Kumar's 'tiranga - 1992', 'police and the God of Humanity - 1993', 'betaz Badshah - 1994', 'jawab - 1995', 'god and Gun' were released
 nitant akele rahane vaale raaj kumaar ne shaayad yah mahasoos kar liya tha ki maut unke kaafii qareeb he isiilie apane putr puru raaj kumaar ko unhone apane paas bula liya or kaha, "dekho maut or zindagi insaan kaa nijee maamla hota he
 Don't tell my death to anyone other than my friend Chetan Anand
 meraa antim sanskaar karne ke baad hi film udyog ko suchit karnaa
 " filmi duniya ke sartaaj abhinayta rajkumaar 3 july 1996 main ke din hamen chhodkar chale gaye the
 But Rajkumar's acting style, his white shoes and his dialogue are alive in the audience till date
 chinoy seth, jinke ghar shishe ke bane hote hai wo dusron par pathar nahin phenkate
 Movie 'waqt' aapke pair bahut khubasurat hai
 Do not keep them on the ground, it will become dirty
 film 'pakija' We will kill you and kill you for sure
 lekin vah vakt bhi hamaara hoga
 The gun will also be ours and the bullet will also be ours
 film 'saudagar' i wish you had given us a voice, we would have risen from the slumber of death
 film 'saudagar' Our tongue is also like our bullet
 dushman se sidhi baat karti he
 Film 'tiranga' ham ankho se surama nahin churaate
 We steal the eyes
 film 'tirangaa' We will give you the death which is neither written in any book of law nor any criminal should have thought
 film 'tirangaa' Grandfather is the only two in this world
 ek upar vaala or doosraa main
 The film 'marete Dum Tak' ham kutton se baat nahin karte
 'until death' bazaar ke kisi sadak chhap darji ko bulaakar use apane kafan kaa naap de do
 'until death' ham tumhen aisi maut maarenge ki tumhaari aane vaali naslon kii neend bhi us maut ko sochakar ud jaaegi
 The film 'marete Dum Tak' raaj kumaar ne 'dil ek mandir' or 'vaqt' ke liye filmafere sarvshereshth sahaayak abhinayta kaa puraskaar praapt kiya
 The legendary actor Raj Kumar, who ruled the audience's heart for nearly four decades with his heartfelt acting, said goodbye to this world on 3 July 1996

 66px 66px charyaapad puthi bankimachandra chattopadhyaay, rabindranath thakur, kaaji nazarul islam begum rokeya, mir mashaararaf hosen, sharatchandra chattopadhyaay The literature of Bengali language can be broadly divided into three parts - 1
 pracheen, 2
 Middle Carpet and 3
 aadhunik-
 Early literature is more important from the point of view of Bengal's life and its merits and demerits
 chandidas, krittivas, maladhar, pipalai, lochanda, gyaandas, kavikankan, mukundaram, krishnadas, kashiram das, bharatchandaray, gunakar aadi kavi isi kaal main hue hai
 Like other scholars of India, the scholars of Bengal used to give special importance to the works of Sanskrit
 unki drushti main vahi "amar bharti" kaa pad sushobhit kar sakati thi
 He considered colloquial language to be variable and temporary
 kintu jansadharan to apane vichaaron or bhaavon ko prakat karne ke liye usee bhashaa ko pasand kar sakate the jo unke hriday ke adhik nikat ho
 They could teach and teach in the same language
 puraatan bengal main is tarah kii do bhashaayen prachlit thim-ek to sthaneey bhashaa, jise ham pracheen banglaa kah sakate hai, duusari akhil bhartiya jan saahitiyik bhashaa, jo saamanyat: samooche uttar bharat main samajhi ja sakati thi
 It can be called Nagar or Shaurseni Apabhransh, which was largely the language of western Uttar Pradesh, eastern Punjab and Rajasthan
 saamaanya janata ke liye in donon bhashaaon main thodaa sa sahitya vidyaman tha
 Songs of love and devotion, proverbs and folklore were found in the mother tongue
 buddha tathaa hindu dharm ke upadeshak janata main prachaar karne ke liye jo rachanaayen taiyaar karte the ve praaia: puraani banglaa tathaa nagar apbhransh, donon main hoti thim
 47 Chariyapads are of special importance in the available compositions of the ancient Bengali
 ye praaia: aath panktiyon ke rahasyamay geet hai jinka sambandh mahayan bauddhadharm tathaa nathpanth, donon se sambhddha gupt sampradaay se he
 Their common external meaning is often understood in this way and the deeper meaning can also be understood with the help of Sanskrit commentary, which was received with this collection as well as Sri Harprasad Shastri
 in geeton yaa padyon main "kavita" naam kii cheez to nahin he kintu jivan kii ekaadh jhalak avashya kisi kisi main dekh padati he
 Some other poetic compositions similar to this were also received from Nepal by Dr
 Prabodhchandra Bagchi and Rahul Sankrityayan etc
 " 12veen shatabdi ke ant tak puraatan banglaa main yathesht sahitya taiyaar ho chukaa tha jisase us samay ke ek bengali kavi ne yah garvokti kii thi "log jaisaa ganga main snaan karne se pavitra ho jate hai, vaise hi ve 'bengal vaani' main snaat hokar pavitra ho sakate hai
 "but unfortunately, apart from the said 47 Chariyapadas and few songs or verses, very few compositions of that period are available today
 gitgovind ke rachayita jayadev bengal ke hindu raja lakshmana sen ke shasankaal main vidyaman the
 There are 24 songs in this beautiful poem describing the love of Radha and Krishna, but not everyone is perfect
 sanskrit main praaia: tukant nahin miltaa
 This is the specialty of Apabhransh or the budding indo-aryan languages
 kuch vidwaanon kaa mat he ki in padon kii rachana mulat: puraani banglaa main yaa apbhransh main kii gai thi or phir unamem thodaa parivartan kar sanskrit ke anuroop bana diya gaya
 In this way Jayadeva can be considered a famous poet of ancient Bengal, who in addition to Sanskrit, probably composed in Old Bengali too
 jo ho, bengal ke kitne hi pargami kaviyon ko unase prerana mili, isamen andeh nahin
 There is no evidence that there has been a big poem written in the old Bengali
 us samay aisi rachanaayen bengal main bhi praaia: apbhransh main hi hoti thim
 However, when the famous poet Vidyapati of Mithila composed the famous historical poem, he also practiced it not in his mother tongue Maithili, but in Apabhramsa, although in between, the words Maithil have also been used
 15veen shatee tathaa vishesh rup se 16veen shatee se hi bade prabandh kaavyon evam varnanaatmak rachanaaon kaa nirmaan prarambh hua, udaahrnarya adarsh nari bihula or uske pati lakhidhar kii katha, kalketu or phullara kaa kathanak, ityadi
 In 1203, Turks invaded West Bengal
 vyapak luutmaar, apharan, hatyakand, mehalon tathaa pustakaalayon ke vinaash tathaa balaat dharmaparivartan kii baadh si aa gai
 How could such a time be favorable for literary development
 udaar rukh apnaanevaali sufi prachaarkon ke aagaman main abhi der thi
 No specific authentic texts of literary works of this time can be told

 It was during this period that the Bengali-speaking Muslim population emerged and grew gradually
 turk akramanakariyon main se bahuton ne bengal kii striyon se hi vivaah kar liya or dhire-dhire "yahan kii bhashaa, rahan sahan aadi ko" apana liya
 They forgot Turkish and Arabic remained the language of religion only
 bengal main hindu jameendaaron or saamanton kii hi vyavastha abhi prachlit thi, falat: muslim vichaaron or paddatiyon kaa janajivan par abhi drushtigochar hone yogya vishesh prabhaav nahin padane paaya tha
 When peace was established in Bengal after some time, when the study of Sanskrit, preaching etc
 was facilitated, then education and literature as if the primary renaissance started
 madhyamik banglaa ke pratham mahakavi, jinke sambandh main hame kuch jaankaree he, sambhavat: krittivas ojha the 
 He was the first popular poet to present the Sanskrit Ramayana in Bengali, who portrayed Rama as Valmiki, not as a pure human and heroic man, but as a compassionate avatar of God, towards whom the heart of the simple devotional people is easily attracted could
 isi tarah krishnagtha kaa varnan usee shatabdi main maladhar basu ne kiya
 It is based on the Bhagavata Purana
 bihula kii katha, jo vivaah kii pratham raatri main hi mansa devi dwaara preshit sarp ke dwaara pati ke dase jane par vidhwaa ho gai thi or jisane badi badi kathinaaiyaan jhelkar devataaon ko tathaa mansa devi ko bhi prasann kar pati ko pun: jivit kara lene main safalataa praapt kii thi, pativrata nari ke prem or saahas kii vah apurv pariklpana he jiskaa aavirbhaav kabhi kisi bhartiya mastishk main hua ho
 This story was probably prevalent before the arrival of Muslims, but the first story based on it was composed in Bengali in the 15th century
 inamen se ek ke rachayita vijaygupt or duusari ke vipradaas pipalai maane jate hai
 Chandidas, a famous poet of the pre-secondary Bengali, is considered
 inke naam se koi 1200 pad yaa kavitaayen prachlit hai
 There is so much difference in their language, style etc
 that they do not seem to be composed by the same person
 aisa prathit hota he ki madhyamik banglaa main is naam ke kam se kam teen kavi hue
 The first Chandidas were the pioneers of Srikrishnakirtan who existed before Chaitanya, around 1400 AD
 duusare chandidas dwij chandidas the jo chaitanya ke baad main yaa uttar kaal main hue
 He composed most of the songs of Radha Krishna's love interest that earned Chandidas such a popularity
 tisare chandidas deen chandidas hue jo sangrah ke teen chauthai bhaag ke rachayita prathit hote hai
 There is no doubt that the first two Chandidas were the mainstays of Chandidas's fame

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The Puranas are a treatise on Hinduism
 jinamein sristi, lay, pracheen rishiyon, muniyon or raajaaon ke vrittaat aadi hai
 These are the later texts of the Vedic period, which come under the Department of Smriti
 bhartiya jivan-dhara main jin granthon kaa mahatvapurn sthaan he unamem puraana bhakthi-granthon ke rup main bahut mahatvapurn maane jate hai
 In eighteen Puranas, different gods and goddesses have been described as the centers of sin and virtue, religion and unrighteousness, deeds and actions
 kuch puraanon main sristi ke armbh se ant tak kaa vivaran kiya gaya he
 'purana' literally means 'ancient' or 'old'
 puraanon kii rachana mukhyatah sanskrit main hui he kintu kuch puraana kshetreey bhashaaon main bhi rache gaye hai
 Puranas are found in respect of both Hindu and Jain religions
 puraanon main varnit vishyon kii koi seemaa nahin he
 It describes cosmology, the lineages of deities, kings, heroes, sages, sages, folklore, pilgrimage, temples, medicine, astronomy, grammar, mineralogy, humor, love stories, as well as theology and philosophy
 vibhinn puraanon kii vishay-vastu main bahut adhik asamanta he
 Not only this, many manuscripts of the same Purana have been received which are different from each other
 hindu puraanon ke rachanaakaar agyaat hai or aisa lagata he ki kai rachanakaaron ne kai shatabdiyon main inaki rachana kii he
 In contrast, the Jain Puranas can be described as the creation of the Jain Puranas and the names of the creators
 karmkand se gyaan kii ore aate hue bhartiya maanas main puraanon ke madhyam se bhakthi kii aviral dhara pravaahit hui he
 In the same process of development, Manas gradually moved towards Avatarism or Saguna Bhakti by the formative interpretation of polytheism and Nirguna Brahma
 puraanon main vaidic kaal se chale aate hue sristi aadi sambandhi vichaaron, pracheen raajaaon or rishiyon ke paramparaagat vrittanton tathaa kahaniyon aadi ke sangrah ke saath saath kalpit kathaon kii vichitrataa or rochak varnanon dwaara sampradayik yaa saadhaaran upadesh bhi milte hai
 The Puranas are not proof texts like Shruti, Smriti etc
 puraanon main vishnu, vaayu, matsay or bhagwat main aitihaasik vrutt— raajaaon kii vanshavali aadi ke rup main bahut kuch milte hai
 Although these genealogies are very brief and there are some contradictions among them, but they are of great use
 puraanon kii ore aitihaasikon ne idhar vishesh rup se dhyaan diya he or ve in vanshawaliyon kii chaanbin main lage hai
 'purana' literally means 'ancient legend' or 'old story'
 ‘pura’ shabd kaa arth he - anaagat evam ateet
 The word 'ana' means - say or tell
 raghuvansh main puraana shabd kaa arth he "puraana patrapag magannataram" evam vaidic vaanmay main "pracheen: vrittant:" diya gaya he
 From the cultural meaning, those specific scriptures of Hindu culture, which have been described in words from the creation to the Holocaust, are called Puranas
 puraana shabd kaa ullekh vaidic yug ke veda sahit aditam sahitya main bhi paaya jaataa he at: ye sabase puraatan maane ja sakate hai
 According to the Atharvaveda "ritch: Samani Chhandansi Purana Yajusha Sah 11
7
2") meaning the Puranas originated with Rik, Sama, Yajusud o Chand
 shatapath brahman main to puranavagamay ko veda hi kaha gaya he
 The Chandogya Upanishad has also called Purana the Veda
 brihadaaranyakopanishad tathaa mahabharat main kaha gaya he ki "itihaas puranabhyaan vedarth mupbarhayet" arthath veda kaa arthvistaar puraana ke dwaara karnaa chaiye
 It is clear from them that Puran and history have been kept on the same level in the Vedic period
 amarkosh aadi pracheen koshon main puraana ke paanch lakshan maane gayi hai : sarg, pratisarg, vansh, manvantar, or vanshanucharit 
 It is believed that Brahma, the creator of the universe, who first composed the oldest scripture, is known as Purana
 prachinkaal se puraana devataaon, rishiyon, manushyon - sabhi kaa maargdarshan karte rahe hai
 The Puranas teach man to lead a life according to religion and policy
 puraana manushya ke karmon kaa vishleshan kar unhen dushkarm karne se rokte hai
 The Puranas are virtually an extension of the Vedas
 veda bahut hi jatil tathaa shushk bhashaa-style main likhe gaye hai
 Ved Vyas ji composed and reconstructed the Puranas
 kaha jaataa he, ‘‘purna puraana ’’ jiskaa arth he, jo vedon kaa poorak ho, arthath puraana 
 The sayings in the complex language of the Vedas are explained in simple language in the Puranas
 puraana-sahitya main avatharavaad ko pratishthit kiya gaya he
 Believing the power of the formless formless, worshiping the virtuous form is the subject of these texts
 puraanon main alag-alag devi-devataaon ko kendra main rakhkar paap-punya, dharm-adharm or karm-akarm kii kahaniyaan hai
 Love, devotion, sacrifice, service, tolerance are human qualities in the absence of which an advanced society cannot be imagined
 puraanon main devi-devataaon ke anek swaroopon ko lekar ek vistrut vivaran miltaa he
 Puranas have detailed depiction of misdeeds in revealing truth
 puranakaron ne devataaon kii dushpravritiyon kaa vyapak vivaran kiya he lekin mul uddeshy sadbhaavna kaa vikaas or satya kii pratishtha hi he
 Vanshabali of kings is found only in 5 Matsya, Vayu, Vishnu, Brahmin and Bhagavata Puranas
 puraana atharah hai
 M-2, B-2, Br-3, V-4
 a-1,naa-1, pa-1, lin-1, ga-1, ku-1, sk-1 
vishnu puraana ke anusaar unke naam ye hai—vishnu, padam, brahm, vaayu, bhagwat, naarad, markendeya, agni, brahmavaivart, ling, varah, skanda, vaaman, kurm, matsay, garuda, brahmad or bhavishya
 a peculiarity in the Puranas is that each Purana has names and their number of Atharho Puranas
 naam or shlokasankhya praayah sabaki milti he, kahin kahin bhed he
 Such as Vayu Purana in place of Agni in the Koram Purana; Narsinghpurana in place of Lingapurana in Markandeya Purana; There is Narada Purana in place of Shiva Purana in Devi Bhagwat and Vayu Purana in Matsya
 bhagwat ke naam se aajkal do puraana milte hai—ek shrimadbhagwat, doosraa devibhagwat
 Who is really Purana, there is a fight over it
 ramashram swami ne 'durjanmukhachapetica' main siddh kiya he ki shrimadbhagwat hi puraana he
 On this, Kashinath Bhatt wrote 'durjanmukhahachapetika' and another Pandit wrote 'durjanmukhapadyapaduka' in favor of Devi Bhagwat
 sukhsagar ke anusaara The oldest of the Puranas appears to be Vishnupurana
 usamen sampradayik khinchataan or ragadwesh nahin he
 The five characteristics of the Purana also fall on it
 usamen sristi kii utpatti or lay, manwantaron, bhartadi khandon or suryaadi lokon, vedon kii shakhaon tathaa vedavyas dwaara unke vibhaag, surya vansh, chandra vansh aadi kaa varnan he
 Among the kings of Kali, even the Maurya kings of Magadha and the kings of the Gupta dynasty are mentioned
 shrikrishna kii lilaon kaa bhi varnan he par bilkul us rup main nahin jis rup main bhagwat main he
 Some people say that Vayu Purana is the Shiv Purana because the present day Purana or Upapurana called Shiv Purana has no verse number of 24,000, only 7,000
 vayupurana ke chaar paad he jinamein sristi kii utpatti, kalpon ore manwantaron, vaidic rishiyon kii gaathaon, daksh prajapati kii kanyaon se bhinn bhinn jeevotpati, suryavanshi or chandravanshi raajaaon kii vanshavali tathaa kali ke raajaaon kaa praayah vishnupurana ke anusaar varnan he
 In addition to manvantars and dynasties in the Matsyapuran, Varnashrama Dharma is described in great detail and the whole story of Matsyavatar
 isamen may aadi asuron ke sanhaar, maatrulok, pitrulok, murti or mandir banane kii vidhi kaa varnan vishesh dhang kaa he
 The preaching of Shrimad Bhagwat is the most because it contains a detailed description of the greatness of devotion and the pastimes of Shri Krishna
 nau skandhon ke bheetar to jeevabrahm kii ekta, bhakthi kaa mahatv, sristilila, kapildev kaa janm or apni mata ke prati vaishnav bhavanusaar sankhyashastra kaa upadesh, manwantar or rishivanshavali, avatar jisamen rishabhdev kaa bhi prasang he, dhruv, venu, pruthu, prahlaad ityadi kii katha, samudramathan aadi anek vishay hai
 But the biggest tenth is the wing in which Krishna's Leela is described in detail
 isi skandh ke aadhaar par shringaar or bhakthiras se purna krishnacharit sambandhi sanskrit or bhashaa ke anek granth bane hai
 The Ekadash wing describes the destruction of the Yadavas and the twelfth kingship of the Rāchas of Kali Yuga
 bhagwat kii lekhanstyli anya puraanon se bhinn he
 Its language is erudite and full of literary wonders, due to which its creation is considered to be somewhat behind
 agnipurana ek vilakshan puraana he jisamen rajvanshawaliyon tathaa sankshipt kathaon ke atirikt dharamshastra, raajnneeti, rajdharm, prajadharm, ayurveda, vyakaran, ras, alankaar, shastr-vidya aadi anek vishay hai
 There is also a detailed case of Tantradiksha
 kali ke raajaaon kii vanshavali vikram tak ai he, avatar prasang bhi he
 There are similar stories in other Puranas
 vishnupurana ke atirikt or puraana jo aajkal milte hai unke vishay main andeh hota he ki ve asal puraanon ke na milane par peeche se na banaae gaye hon
 Many of the Puranas are filled with differences of opinion and cults
 koi kisi devtaa kii pradhanta sthapit karata he, koi kisi devtaa kii pradhanta sthapit karata he, koi kisi kii
 According to the introduction of Brahmavaivarta Purana, which is given in Matsyapurana, it should contain the story of Rathantar Kalpa and Varaha Avatar, but the Brahmavaivarta which is found today is not in this story
 krishna ke vrundavan ke raas se jin bhakton kii tripti nahin hui thi unke liye golok main sadaa honevaale raas kaa usamen varnan he
 This Brahmavaivart of today is several hundred years behind the arrival of the Muslims because it also mentions the origin of the 'julaha' caste - Mlechhat Kuvindakanya Jola Jatirbhabhav
 brahmpurana main tirthon or unke mahatmaya kaa varnan bahut adhik hai, anant vasudev or purushottam mahatmaya tathaa or bahut se aise tirthon ke mahatmaya likhe gaye hai jo pracheen nahin kahe ja sakate
 'purushottam Prasad' is definitely a reference to the huge temple of Jagannath ji, which was built by King Chodaganga of the Ganga dynasty
 matsaypurana main die hue lakshan aajkal ke padmapurana main bhi puure nahin milte hai
 There are many things in this about the hostility of Vaishnava communalists
 jaise, pashadilakshan, mayavadaninda, taamsashastra, puranavarnanaityadi
 Vaiseshika, Nyaya, Samkhya and Charvak have been called 'tamas Shastra' and it has also been told that the Buddha-form Vishnu called Asat Buddhist scripture for the destruction of the demons
 isi prakaar matsay, kurm, ling, shiv, skanda or agni taamas puraana kahe gaye hai
 The essence is that the present form of most Puranas is within a thousand years
 sabake sab puraana sampradayik he, isamen bhi koi andeh nahin he
 Many Puranas meet a lot in their ancient form, but in them also communalists have increased many things
 yadhyapi aajkal jo puraana milte hai unamem se adhiktar peeche se bane hue yaa prakshipt vishyon se bhare hue hai tathaapi puraana bahut pracheen kaal se prachlit the
 It is written in the Brihadaranyaka and Shatapatha Brahmana that smoke emanates from the wet wood in the same way as the expulsion of the great ghosts led to the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, Atharvangiras, history, mythology, Upanishads, shlokas, sutras, lectures and lectures
 chhandogya upanishad main bhi likhaa he ki itihaas puraana vedon main paanchavaan veda he
 Puranas were also prevalent with the Vedas in the very ancient times, which were said on the occasion of Yajna etc
 kai baaten jo puraana ke lakshanon main hai, vedon main bhi hai
 Like, before there was nothing else, it was canto or creation; Devasur Sangram, Urvashi Pururava dialogue is history
 mahabharat ke aadi parv main bhi anek raajaaon ke naam or kuch vishay ginaakar kaha gaya he ki inke vrittant vidwaan satkaviyon dwaara puraana main kahe gaye hai
 It can be said that there were Puranas even during the creation of Mahabharata
 manusmriti main bhi likhaa he ki pitrikaaryon main veda, dharamshastra, itihaas, puraana aadi sunaane chahie
 Now the question is, who made the Puranas
 shivpurana ke antargat reva mahatmaya main likhaa he ki atharahon puraanon ke vaktaa matyavatisut vyas hai
 The same thing is prevalent in common people
 par matsaypurana main spasht likhaa he ki pehle puraana ek hi tha, usee se 18 puraana hue 
 It is written in the Brahmanda Purana that Ved Vyasa compiled a Puranasamhita
 iske aage kii baat kaa pataa vishnu puraana se lagata he
 It says that Vyasa had a disciple named 'lomhadisha' who belonged to the Suti caste
 vyas ji ne apni puraana samhita usee ke haath main di
 Lomhadris had six disciples - Sumati, Agnivarcha, Mitrayu, Shanshapayan, Akitavran and Savarni
 inamen se akrutvran, saavarni or shanshpayan ne lomaharshan se padhi hui puranasamhita ke aadhaar par or ek ek samhita banaai
 Just as Ved Vyasa collected mantras and divided them into codes, similarly Puranasamhita was compiled by collecting circles coming in the name of Purana
 usee ek samhita ko lekar sut ke chelon ke teen or sanhitaayen banaai
 Eighteen Puranas would have been made on the basis of these codes
 matsay, vishnu, brahmad aadi sab puraanon main brahmpurana pehla kaha gaya he, par jo brahmpurana aajkal prachlit he vah kaisaa he yah pehle kaha ja chukaa he
 Whatever it is, it is proved from the above proof that eighteen Puranas are not made of Ved Vyasa
 jo puraana aajkal milte hai unamem vishnupurana or brahmadpurana kii rachana auron se pracheen jaan padati he
 The 'future dynasty' in the Vishnupurana mentions even the kings of the Gupta dynasty, this episode cannot be earlier than the sixth century of Christ
 java ke aage jo bali dweep he vahaan ke hinduon ke paas brahmandpurana mila he
 The ancestors of these Hindus settled in the islands of the East in India in the fifth century of Christ
 baliwaale brahmadpurana main 'bhavishya rajvansh prakaran' nahin he, usamen janamejay ke praputra adhisimakrishna tak kaa naam paaya jaataa he
 This is to be noted
 isse prakat hota he ki puraanon main jo bhavishya rajvansh he vah peeche se joda hua he
 The ancient copies of Brahmanda Purana are found here, to see how far the past and present-day action is used in them
 'bhavishyarajvansh varnan' ke purv unamem ye shloke milte hai— It is revealed from the above passage that the Adi Brahmapurana was made in the time of Adhishikrishna
 isi prakaar vishnupurana, matsaypurana aadi kii pariksha karne se pataa chalata he ki aadi vishnupurana parakshit ke samay main or aadi matsaypurana janamejay ke praputra adhisimakrishna ke samay main sankalit hua
 Eighteen Puranas from Purana Samhita were formed in very ancient times, it is known
 aapstamb dharmasutra main bhavishyapurana kaa pramaan is prakaar udadhrut he— It is a must that Puranas are not found in their primitive form nowadays
 bahut se puraana to asal puraanon ke na milane par phir se nae rache gaye hai, kuch main bahut si baaten jod di gai hai
 Almost all the Puranas are nutritious to one of the Shaiva, Vaishnava sect and solar sects, there is no doubt about it
 vishnu, rudra, surya aadi kii upasna vaidic kaal se hi chali aati thi, phir dhire dhire kuch log kisi ek devtaa ko pradhanta dene lage, kuch log duusare ko
 Thus the cults started behind the Mahabharata
 puranasamhitaayein usee samay main baniin
 Then later became Adipuranas, some of whose parts are within some Puranas found today
 puraanon kaa uddeshy puraane vritton kaa sangrah karnaa, kuch pracheen or kuch kalpit kathaon dwaara upadesh dena, devamahima tathaa tirthamahima ke varnan dwaara jansadharan main dharmbuddhi sthir rakhana tha
 From this, Vyas gave a man of sutra caste to propagate his collected Adipuran Samhita
 jain parampara main 63 shalakapurush maane gaye hai
 The Puranas have their stories and descriptions of religion etc
 praakrit, sanskrit, apbhransh tathaa anya deshi bhashaaon main anek puraanon kii rachana hui he
 The Puranas and literature of both the sects are available in large quantities
 inamen bhartiya itihaas kii mahatvapurn saamagree milti he
 In Jainism, 24 Puranas are named after Tirthakaras; There are many more, including the supernatural character of the Tirthankaras, their superiority to all the gods, detailed description of Jainism related elements, fruitfulness, greatness etc
 alag padmapurana or harivansh bhi hai
 The main Puranas are: 'adipuran' of Jinsen and 'arishtanemi' Purana of Jinsen, 'padmapurana' of Ravishana and 'uttapurana' of Gunabhadra
 praakrit or apbhransh bhashaaon main bhi ye puraana uplabdh hai
 These Puranas are very important in terms of India's culture, tradition, philosophical thought, language, style etc
