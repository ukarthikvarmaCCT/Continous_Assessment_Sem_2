 Paleontology or paleontology or palaeontology is a branch of geology that deals with the remains of animals and plants of the geological ages which are now found only in the rocks of the earth's crust
 jeevashmiki kii paribhaasha dete hue tweb hofel or aak ne likhaa he : jeevashmiki vah vigyaan he, jo aadim paudhen tathaa jantuon ke ashmibhoot avasheshon dwaara prakat bhootkaaleen bhugarbhik yugon ke jeevanaki vyakhya karata he
 Thus it is clear that paleontology studies primitive animals on the basis of their volatile remains
 jeevashm shabd se hi yah ingit hota he ki jeev + ashm kaa adhyayan he
 The term Palaentology in English also refers to the study of Palaios = Ancient + Onto = Fauna
 jeevashm vigyaan kaa adhyayan jeevigyaan kii nai shakha he or iskaa vikaas gat 200 varshon se hi adhik hua he
 Long before the development of this branch of science, it was in the knowledge of the primitive human beings that in some types of rocks, a strange type of remains are found which correspond to marine organisms
 gyaan ke abhaav main usne pehle-pahal in avasheshon ko jaivik utpatti kaa na samajhakar, prakruti ke vinod kii saamagree samaj rakhaa tha, jo prithvi ke andar kisi shakti ke kaaran ban gaye
 But, with the increase of knowledge, man had to change his thoughts in this direction too and he discovered that the remains of the remains found in the rocks were living creatures at some time and the place where Today we find these fossils was in the womb of the sea in geological ages
 san 1820 tak keval 127 ashmibhoot vanaspatiyon tathaa 2,100 jantuon kaa hi pataa chalaa tha, jo 1840 tak badhkar kramash: 2,050 tathaa 24,300 kii sankhya tak pahunch gaya
 Since then, these numbers have increased unprecedentedly
 maanav kshamta ke adheen yah sambhav nahin he ki sansar ke jine bhi jeevashmon ke strot hai, un sabaki khojbin kar lee jaae
 Secondly, life on Earth has been originating since billions of years ago
 tisare, sansar kii bhugolic akruti jaisi aaj drushtigochar hoti he, waisi un dinon nahin thi
 Animals used to move from one place to another
 at: hamen unke ashmibhoot namoonon se jo gyaan praapt hota yaa ho saktaa he, vah vicchhinn hi he, yaa hoga
 In the end, it is never possible that all the creatures who were present in that dark age of history, all of them have already been pornized
 ashmikaran kii kuch dashaayen hoti hai, jinke kaaran jeevajantu ke mrit shariron kaa ashmikaran ho jaataa he
 The vulgarization of all creatures is neither necessary nor possible
 is kaaran bhi aadi jeevon ke jivan kaa shrunkhalabaddh itihaas likhnaa duruh kaary he
 On the basis of all the fossil evidence we have received so far, there is a lot of light on the evolution of organisms
 jeevashmon ke adhyayan se hamen un jeevon kaa pataa chalata he jo ab yaa to lupt ho gaye hai, yaa unka vartmaan swaroop paryaapt parivartit ho gaya he
 Fossils are remnants of ancient creatures, which have become stone like stones in stones or other places
 jeevon ke kuch aise bhi avshesh praapt hue hai, jo prastirbhoot na hokar apane mul rup main hi hai
 Dead bodies of mammoths and other animals found in the icebergs are safe in museums in Russia and England and America
 jeevashm bhi, aadhunik jeevon kii akruti se, newnaadhik rup main, milte-julate hai
 Fossils are found only in sedimentary rocks
 anek prakaar ke jeevajantuon kii anek paristhitiyon main mrityu ke uparaant unke shavon par jo avsaad jamaa haate hate hai, kalantar main ve hi jeevashm ban jaaya karte hai
 Some fossils are so complete that even after their molecular examination, even the cell compositions of organisms are visible
 jeevon ke ashmibhoot pramaan apane jivit sharir ke rup main hi mil jaaen, yah aavashyak nahin he
 In their bodies, disorder arises due to decay, oxidation, deforming by predatory organisms, cold, rain, sunlight etc
 kuch jantu, jinke sharir calcium carbonate, silica aadi jaise acarbonic padaarthon dwaara bane hote hai, unpar vikaar kaa prabhaav apekshaakrit kam padataa he
 Fossils of such organisms are available in very small numbers
 jo uplabdh hai bhi ve aadhunik jivit jeevon se tulana karne ke liye apurna hai
 Another feature of organisms is that fossils of one type are found only in certain types of rocks
 in shilakhandon se jeevashmon ke purna jivan ke parivesh kaa gyaan ho jaataa he
 Fossils also show how the organism used to live and what it used to eat
 inase tatkaaleen bhugolic paristhitiyon par bhi prakaash padataa he
 Fossils found in snow fields or the entire biosphere have proved to be a boon for fossil scientists
 visheshat: siberia ke sudur uttar dhruvasagariya kshetra main lagbhag sampurna jeev jyon ke tyon praapt hue hai
 They throw a lot of light on the creatures of the distant past
 saadhaaran rup se jantuon ke sharir ke kade bhaag-haddiyaan, daant, khol aadi-prastareekrut ho jate hai
 Lall described the city of Pampei, Italy as 'jeevashmanagar', stating that at least 2,000 people died in this beautiful city as a result of the rise of the Visuvius volcano in 79 CE
 jwalamukhi kii dadhakati aag, tapt raakh aadi ne sampurna nagar ko kai foot moti part se dhank diya
 Finally, large burning pieces of the mountain penetrated inside the windows and doors of the houses and buried the dead humans and animal bearers inside them

 Sometimes, the hollow bones of vulgar animals, such as the skull, bones of the extremities, fat or marrow within the shells, are destroyed and other substances get depressed
 kalantar main ye itane kathor ho jate hai ki yadi upree khol ko tod diya jaae to bheetar ek murti jaisi pratikruti jaati he
 Similarly, the footprints of swamps, wet soils and cattlemen on the ground have also become obscured
 in padchihnon se jantuon ke pairon ke talvon kii rachanakriti evam aakaar kaa hi gyaan nahin hota varan unke avaagaman ke maarg kaa bhi nirdesh hota he
 The feast of some animals is also obtained in the vulgar form
 inke rasinic adhyayan se un jantuon ke aahaar kaa gyaan hota he
 Other small fish or insects, pests, cattle, undercooked meat, etc
 have also been found in the food grain of some sea fishes and other animals
 in jeevashmon ko ateet kii thati samajhnaa chahie kyonki inase prithvi ke lakhon karodon varsh purv kii avasthaa ke pramaan milte hai
 Fossils help a lot in determining the identity of rocks and the sequence of these levels
 inaki kuch pramukh upyogitaayen nimnlikhit hai : Chronological - On the basis of evidence engraved in fossils or found in complete or incomplete form, the ancient geological condition is revealed
 kisi bhugarbhik kalvishesh kaa nirdhaaran karne main jeevashmon se bahut sahaayta milti he
 The stratigraphic position or stratum configuration has been considered to be inseparable relation to fossils
 prithvi par jo bhautik-rasinic parivartan pehle ho chuke hai, lagbhag vaise hi parivartan aaj bhi ho rahe hai
 However, organisms have evolved gradually
 unka jo swaroop pehle tha, usamen mahaan, antar pad gaya he
 The nature of mineral materials has been variable even though the nature of organic matter has changed
 at: khanij padarthyukt shailakhandon se unki pracheenta kaa nirdhaaran kathin hota he
 But studying the sediments of fossils found between them makes this task simple
 kuch jeevashmon ko nirdeshak jeevashm kii sangya is aadhaar par de di gai he ki unase yah siddh ho jaataa he ki amuk jantu yaa vanaspati amuk bhugarbhik kaal main hi utpann hue yaa ho sakate hai
 Primitive surroundings - For the life of animals, whether they are vegetation, animals, special types of geographical environment are suitable
 duusare shabdon main kah sakate hai ki vishesh vaataavaran main vishesh prakaar ke jeev jantu jivit rahete hai
 The fossils reveal what kind of geographical environment was there for the living of the then living animals
 in jeevajantuon kii mrityu kis prakaar hui athwa kis sthaan par kis avasthaa main hui thi, isaki bhi ek jhalak jeevashm de dete hai
 Along with this, fossils throw a lot of light on the extent and extent of ancient land, sea, reservoir etc
, the migration of animals and birds etc
 inhen jeevashmon ke adhyayan kaa parinaam yah hua ki ki pracheenkaaleen bhaugalik maanchitron kii rachana saral evam sulabh ho sakati he
 a new science has been born to study the geographical environment revealed by fossils, which is called archaeology
 puraparisthitiki -sajiv praaniyon ko jivit rahane ke liye vividh prakaar ke pariveshon kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Some organisms live above or within the body of other organisms; These are called parasites or parasites
 kuch jeev anya jeevon ke nikat sampark main yaa unase sanlagn rahakar apana jivan nirvaah karte hai
 Knowledge of this interconnection of fauna by fossils is readily available to us
 jeevon kaa udvivikas -charles darwin ke jeevon ke udvivikas sambandhi siddhant kii pushti ke liye jin pusht pramaanon yaa tarkon ko unke samarthak upasthit kiya karte hai, unamem 'jeevashmiya pramaan' bhi ek he
 Each fossil is in itself a proof of its own power of biology
 inke adhyayan se inke kramik vikaas par prachur prakaash padataa he
 The study of fossils suggests that there was a time in ancient times, when the Earth was invaded by dinosaur giant animals, or the surviving remains of Silacanthus fishes are probably gone
 isi prakaar, udvivikas sambandhi anya anek samasyaon kaa samaadhaan jeevashm karte rahe hai
 Paleontology is divided into several branches
 suvidha kii drushti se ab yah niyam sa ban gaya he ki jab ham 'jeevashmiki' shabd kaa upyog karte hai tab hamaara abhipraay keval aksheruki jeevon ke jeevashmon ke adhyayan se hota he
 The branch of paleontology under which vertebrate fossils are studied is called vertebrate paleontology
 padap jeevashmon kaa adhyayan ek bhinn shakha ke antargat kiya jaataa he jise padpashm vigyaan kehete hai
 In modern times, some other major branches of paleontology have also developed, whose fields of study are very small organisms and fossil humans respectively
 jeevashmiki kaa kshetra bada vyapak he or uski seemaa nishchit rup se nirdhaarit nahin kii ja sakati
 If viewed theoretically, the emergence of fossilism begins with the evolution of an organism on Earth, but on geological grounds it can only be said that half of the history of the entire organism on Earth, or even less, We find the records of creatures
 jeevashm vaigyanik anveshanon kaa prarambhkaal aise pracheenatam prapya jeevashmon se kiya ja saktaa he jinke jaivik gun jaivikeey aadhaar par batalaaye ja sakate hai
 Paleontology has a very close relationship with geology, especially layered-rock-geology
 ateet kaal ke jeevon ke avshesh starit shailon main paae jate hai
 The fossils found in them have been very helpful in the construction of these rocks and in establishing their sequence
 vastav main bina jeevashmon ke starit-shail-bhoumiki, ek prakaar se, vyaavhaarik jeevashmiki he
 Paleontology has a close relationship with biology
 jaiviki ke antargat vartmaan jivit praaniyon or padpon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he, jab ki jeevashmiki main bhoumikeey yugon ke un jeevon or padpon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he jo kabhi jivit the or ab jeevashm ke rup main hi prapya hai
 But paleontology cannot be considered a branch of biology, as the material of the study of paleontology and the manner of its collection are completely different from the material of the study of biology and the manner of its collection
 yah nishchit karnaa ki kis sthaan par jeevashmiki ko jaiviki se pruthak kiya ja saktaa he, praaia: asambhav sa he
 But roughly the end of fossils and the beginning of biology can be traced back to the Sandhisthana of the ultra-new age and modern era
 is prakaar se anishchit or sandigdh cambrian-purv mahakalp praani evam padapjaat tathaa vartmaan kaal ke nishchit tathaa anek prakaar ke jeevon or padpon ke bich main anek tathaa vibhinn prakaar ke jeev avshesh milte hai, jo jeev par prakaash daalate hai
 These fossils found in the sedimentary rocks of Bhuparpti are the basis of the study of paleontology
 jeevigyaani jeevashmiki main isliye atyadhik abhiruchi rakhte hai ki iskaa jeevvikas jaise vishay se nikat sambandh he
 The history or species of species of animals and plants can be traced more confidently based on the study of fossils derived from the sequenced levels of layered rocks
 parantu jeevon ke apurna abhilekh ke kaaran unke jativrutt ke anurekhan main atyadhik baadha padati he, kyonki bhoumikeey yugon main paae janevaale praaniyon or padpon main se kuch hi or unamem se adhikansh apurna dasha main, in shailon main parilakshith paae jate hai
 In spite of this incompleteness of the inscription, in many organisms, when they are traced from one level to the other, the changes take place
 jab jeevashmon ke praturup vibhinn anukramit staron se ekatrit kiye jate hai, tab pratyaksh rup se do bhinn dikhaai padanevaali jatiyaan bich ke jeevashmon dwaara sambandhit dikhaai padati hai or nimnatam str main pai janevaali jati se lekar ucchtam str main milanevaali jati tak ke bichwaale staron ke jeevashmon ke jeevon main hue parivartanon ko dekha ja saktaa he
 In addition to the standard method, comparative methods of body and personality can also be used to detect caste from fossils
 at: jeevashmiki is dharna kii pushti karata he ki jeevvikas shanai: shanai: tathaa kramash: honevaale parivartanon ke parinamswaroop hua
 There is also evidence to suggest that the evolution of organism was evolutionary
 kehane kaa taatpary yah he ki kuch jeevon ke varg main jeevvikasiya parivartan yug ugantar tak kisi nishchit disha main hue or iske atirikt aise sambhddha varg jo ek hi paitruk utpatti ke hai, ek duusare se tathaa bahya dashaon se bina prabhavit hue, apane vikaas main samaan avasthaaon athwa usase milti julati avasthaaon main se gujarey, jisase yah prakat ho jaataa he ki jeevon ke vibhinn virgon main vikaas kii disha, sarsaadhaaran purvaj se paitruk gunon dwaara nishchit ho jaati he
 Tracing the complete stages of development from the unicellular egg of the living plants and animals to the final stage, is subject to geology and organism
 kisi varg ke padpon or praaniyon kii jatiyon kaa vikaas, kam se kam apni praarambhik avasthaaon main lagbhag samaan hota he or ek varg ke antargat aanevaale sampurna bhrunon main, kisi ek avasthaa tak ek duusare main itani sadrishyata hoti he ve pruthak nahin kiye ja sakate
 This fact has revealed excessive fraternity in shapes that are highly different from one another in adulthood
 is baat kii vaastaviktaa kasherukiyon main dekhne ko milti he, jinke bhrun praarambhik avasthaaon main ati kathinaayee ke saath ek duusare se alag kiye ja sakate hai or jo bahut dhire dhire apane varg athwa gana kii lakshanik akritiyon ko dhaaran kar lete hai
 The results of these embryological explorations have a special relationship with paleontology
 aise anek jeevashm jaankaree main hai jo apane main apane se sambandhit aadhunik jeevon kii tulana main bhruneey, athwa kam se kam dimbhiy, athwa kishoravasa ke lakshan dikhaate hai
 Examples of this type of primitive embryonic types are found especially in vertebrates, as skeletons become obscured during the very early period of life
 at: aadhunik jeevon kii apraudh avasthaaon kii tulana sidhe praudh jeevashm se kii ja sakati he
 Giving definite names to fossils is important to the paleontologist so that he can distinguish more accurately among fossils
 jeevashmon kaa namakaran saamanyat: unheen siddhanton par aadhaarit he jinpar praaniyon kaa
 Pranijagat is divided into many sanghas and each sangha is divided into several classes, gana, clans, clans and castes
 jeevashmon ke kai prakaar ke praroop hote hai
 If the investigator describes an entire caste on the basis of a model of a fossil of that caste, then that fossil model is called the name of that caste
 yadi kisi ek ke namprarup kaa nishchay karne main anveshak anya jeevashm namoonon kii sahaayta letaa he, to in atirikt namoonon ko paratip kehete hai
 If the investigator takes the help of many other fossil specimens without deciding the name, then these fossil specimens are called Sahuparup
 yadi kisi jati ke jeevashm kaa sahpraroop us jati ke praarambhik varnan ke pashchaat kii us jati kaa praaroop chun jaataa he, to vah jeevashm praroop lactotip kehalaata he
 Just as there are fossil specimens to describe a caste, similarly there are caste or homogeneous fossils to describe a lineage
 yadi koi anveshak kisi ek nae vansh kaa varnan kisi ek vishesh jati ke aadhaar par karata he, to vah jati us vansh ke liye jenoholotip ho jaati he
 If the investigator gives a list of such castes in the description of the new dynasty that he considers to be under the new lineage, then all these species are called genocyntypes
 bahut se jenocentipon main se baad main aadi anveshak dwaara athwa baad main kisi anya anveshak dwaara ek jenolectotip chhaanta ja saktaa he
 The geological period is divided into five major parts
 ye kramash: nimnlikhit hai- Archaeozoic Mahakalp is the oldest among them
 bhoumikeey kaal ke in paanch mahakalpon main vibhaajan mukhyat: in mahakalpon main milanevaale praaniyon or padpon ke jeevashmon par hi aadhaarit he
 Of these, the Archeozoic Great Canyon was fauna
 is mahakalp main na kisi prakaar ke jeevajantu or na paudhe hi the
 Therefore, we do not find any fossils in the rocks of this period
 pragjeev mahakalp main protozoa jaise ati saadhaaran prakaar ke jeevajantu astitv main aae
 But due to the lack of any tough part in these ordinary organisms, they could not be preserved in the rocks
 at: pragjeev mahakalp ke shailon main bhi jeevashm nahin milte
 The other three Mahakalpas, namely, the Puranjeevi Mahakalpa, the Madhyamajeeva Mahakalpa and the Nutanjeevi Mahakalpa are fossiliferous
 in mahakalpon ke antargat aanevaale jitne bhi chote se lekar bade tak vibhaajan hai ve sab purnat: us kaal main paae janevaale jeevon ke jeevashm par hi aadhaarit hai
 Therefore, we see that the work of layered paleontologists cannot run without the help of paleontology
 yahi kaaran he ki jeevashm vigyaan starit shailavigyaan kaa merudand kehalaata he
 On the basis of paleontology broadly, the following four main animal and plant ethnic superpowers can be established: purv purajivi mahakalp - iske antargat cambrian, ordovishan or silyurian kalp aate hai
 Answer: The archaeological Mahakalpa - Dioni, Carboni and Permian Kalpa are covered under it
 madhyajivi mahakalp Nutanjeev Mahakalpa - Abhinav Kaal is also under it
 praaia: sab pramukh aksheruki praaniyon ke pratinidhi jeevashm cambrin staron main paae jate hai or unamem se trilobite jaise kuch praani adicrambrian kaal main hi apekshaya adhik viksit ho chuke the
 Hence the assumption that the ancestors of all classes found in the Cambrian strata were found in the pre-cambrian period, although their remains are not found in the Cambrian pre-shales
 yah kalpana kii ja sakati he ki cambrionpurv samudron main sab prakaar ke praani rahete the, parantu ve sab komalangi purvaj the, jinhone apane astitv ke vishay main kisi bhi prakaar ke chihr nahin chhoden hai
 Since all types of animals are directly or indirectly dependent on plants, and plants only have the power to process inorganic foods, it also seems reasonable to assume that plants existed in the pre-cambrian period
 parantu yah aashcharya kii baat he ki paudhon ke avshesh purajivi mahakalp ke staron main nahin paae gaye hai
 Following is a brief description of the main characteristics of the zoological world of the predecessor Mahakalpa: yah matsay or parnang samaan sthal padpon kaa, jinhen terridosperms kehete hai, yug tha
 Along with these were found goniotites, spiriferid bahupad and rugos coral
 madhyajivi mahakalp sarisrupon or amonites kaa kalp kehalaata he
 Along with them, rinconilids and corals were also prominent in the Belemnites Brachiopoda
 yah kalp staniyon, pakshiyon, foraminipheron or aavrutabiji padpon kaa kaal tha
 On the basis of animals and plants, we cannot separate the new life cycle from modern times
 sampurna shailon ke anukram kaa kram bhalee bhanti nishchay ho jane or unamem paae janevaale jeevashmon kii pahchaan ho jane ke uparaant yah pataa chalaa ki jeevon ke vikaas main shanai:-shanai: pragati hui
 The most common types of organisms first appeared, which are found in the oldest sedimentary rocks, and after that the complex organisms gradually came to the Tarunatar rocks
 is prakaar sampurna aksheruki sanghon ke pratinidhi, jo jeevashm rup main parirakshan yogya hai, cambrian shailon main milte hai, parantu prayek sangh ke antargat paae janevaale jeev apni rachana main praaia: samaan the or bahut kam parivartan dikhaate the
 On morphological basis, we may call them underdeveloped lineages, but in later ages the composition of organisms found in each association was more varied and this fact is confirmed to some extent by the increase in the number of lineages
 kasherukiyon main rachana ke aadhaar par aadim varg samajha janevaala cychlosotomata varg he, jiskaa sabase pehle pradurbhaav hua or jiske uparaant kramash: matsay, ubhaychar, sarisrup, pakshi or stani aae or ye varg usee kram se prakat hote gaye jaisaa unki rachana se aashaa kii jaati thi
 Thus, the order of acquisition of organisms in the geological ages proves the truth of the theory of biology, because the older the shells are, the simpler their living remains are and as such the study of the nearest rocks according to the geological time table Such complex organism remains are found
 jeevvikasiya siddhant kaa pratipaadan karne ke liye ghode ke vikaas kaa adhyayan acha udhaaharan he
 All the material on which the history of horse development is based is derived from tertiary rocks of North America
 iske vikaas kii mukhya dishaaen ye hai : Increase in size, increase in speed, increase in head and cervix
 ghode kaa sabase pracheenatam jeevashm iohipus he, jo nimna iosin shailon main paaya gaya he or jo aakar main billi se lekar lomadee ke baraabar tha
 The horse of the Middle Eocene is known as Orohippus, which was only slightly larger than Eohippus in size
 uttar iosin kaa ghoda apihipus kehalaata he, jiske vishay main puri jaankaree nahin he
 The horse, popularly known as Mesohippus, is found in the lower and middle Oligocene rocks
 yah aakaar main bhed ke baraabar, yaa usase kuch chota, tha
 Myohypus, which was found in the later Oligocene and lower Myocene eras, was only slightly larger than sheep
 parahipas nimna myosin yug main ati prachur tha
 The horse of the Middle Myocene was called Mericippes
 jo parahipas hi ke samaan tha
 The Pleocene era horse, Plyohippus, was equivalent in size to a donkey, but the tertiary era was equivalent to a horse found in the present period
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki ghode ke aakar main dhire-dhire vruddhi hui
 Similarly, changes in the internal structure of horse's arms and legs increased its speed
 is parivartan kaa mukhya lakshan parshv bhaagon kaa hraas or madhya athwa aksheeya bhaag kaa vistaar or vardhan tha, jisase vah daudte samay dridhtaa ke saath bojha sambhaal sake
 Similarly, everything other than the bone between the wrists was depleted, which made the wrist firm

 He wrote with full authority in Hindi and Urdu
 unki adhikansh rachanaaen mul rup se urdu main likhi gai hai lekin unka prakaashan hindi main pehle hua
 In the thirty-three years of creative life, he was entrusted with a legacy of literature which is invaluable in terms of quality and infinite in terms of size
 premachand kii rachana-drushti vibhinn sahitya roopon main pravrutt hui
 a versatile genius, Premchand created literature in many genres such as novels, stories, plays, reviews, articles, editorials, memoirs etc

 yah sthiti hindi or urdu bhashaa donon main samaan rup se dikhaayi detii he
 Premchand's novels are milestones not only in Hindi novel literature but also in Indian literature
 premachand katha-sahitya main unke upanyaaskaar kaa armbh pehle hota he
 His first Urdu novel Asrar Maabid aka Devasthan Rajya was published in serial form in Urdu weekly "awaaz-e-khalk" from 8 October 1903 to 1 February 1905
 unka doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 Since Premchand was originally the author of Urdu and came from Urdu into Hindi, all his early novels were originally written in Urdu and later he was written in Hindi
 unhone 'sevasadan' upanyaas se hindi upanyaas kii duniya main pravesh kiya
 He originally wrote it in Urdu under the name 'bajare-hussan' but first published its Hindi form 'sevasadan'
 'sevasadan' ek nari ke veshya banane kii kahani he
 According to Dr
 Ram Vilas Sharma, the main problem expressed in 'sevasadan' is the subordination of the Indian woman

 Premchand had started a revolutionary change in Hindi fiction by making Surdas, a blind beggar, a hero of fiction in Rangbhoomi
 godaan kaa hindi sahitya hi nahin, vishwa sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan he
 In it, Premchand's literary ideology achieves perfection from 'idealistic realism' to 'critical realism'
 ek saamaanya kisaan ko puure upanyaas kaa nayak bananaa bhartiya upanyaas parampara kii disha badal dene jaisaa tha
 The death of Hori, a storyline trapped in the cycle of feudalism and capitalism, shakes the minds of readers
 kisaan jivan par apane pichley upanyaason 'premashram' or 'karmbhumi' main premanchad yatharth kii prastuti karte-karte upanyaas ke ant tak adarsh kaa daaman tham lete hai
 But Godan's tactful ending is a witness to the fact that Premchand was disillusioned with idealism by then
 yah unki aakhri daur kii kahaniyon main bhi dekha ja saktaa he
 Mangalasutra is an unfinished novel of Premchand
 premchand ke upanyaason kaa mul kathy bhartiya gramin jivan tha
 The height that Premchand gave to the Hindi novel remained a challenge for the successors of the latter

 Most of his stories depict lower and middle classes

 According to him Premchand has written a total of 301 stories, 3 of which are still inaccessible

 The first story of this collection, Ratan, the world's most precious, is generally considered to be his first published story

 He has made the main characters in his stories from all classes of humans to animals and birds
 unki kahaniyon main kisaanon, mazdooron, striyon, daliton, aadi kii samasyaayein gambhirtha se chitrit hui hai
 He has written stories related to social reform, patriotism, freedom struggle etc
 unki aitihaasik kahaniyaan tathaa prem sambandhi kahaniyaan bhi kaaphi lokapriy sabit huin
 These names can be taken in the leading stories of Premchand - 'panch Parmeshwar', 'gulli Danda', 'doha Baalon Ka Katha', 'idgah', 'bade Bhai Sahab', 'pus Ki Raat', 'kafan', ' Thakur's well ',' Sadgati ',' Budhi Kaki ',' Tawan ',' Demolition ',' Price of milk ',' Mantra 'etc
 premchand ji kii lokapriy kahaniyaan Premchand composed the plays 'sangram', 'karbala' and 'prem ki Vedi'
 ye naatak shilp or samvednaa ke str par achche hai lekin unki kahaniyon or upanyaason ne itani oonchaai praapt kar lee thi ki naatak ke kshetra main premchand ko koi khaas safalataa nahin mili
 These plays have become really interactive novels
 premchand ek samvedansheel kathakaar hi nahin, sajag naagarik va sampadak bhi the
 He edited his literary and social concerns through articles or essays in 'hans', 'madhuri', 'jagran' etc
, while editing magazines and magazines in the then other co-existing literary magazines 'chand', 'maryada', 'swadesh' etc
 Expressed from amritraay dwaara sampadit 'premchand : vividh prasang' vastav main premchand ke lekhon kaa hi sankalan he

 Translated 'tolstoy's Stories', three plays of Galsvardi under the names 'strike', 'silver Ki Dibiya' and 'nyaya'
 unke dwaara ratannath sarshar ke urdu upanyaas 'fasaan-e-aaazaad' kaa hindi anuwaad 'aaazaad katha' bahut mashhoor hua
 Premchand came to Hindi with the rite of Urdu and became a great Hindi writer
 hindi ko apana khaas muhaavara or khulaapan diya
 Both the story and the novel made epoch-making changes
 unhone sahitya main samayikta prabal aagrah sthapit kiya
 He made the common man the subject of his creations and, by openly penning his problems, placed him on the post of heroes of literature
 premchand se pehle hindi sahitya raja-rani ke kisson, rahasy-romaanch main ulajhaa hua tha
 Premchand took literature to the surface of truth
 unhone jivan or kalkhand kii sachai ko panne par utaara
 He continued to write for a lifetime on communalism, corruption, zamindari, indebtedness, poverty, colonialism
 premachand kii zyaadaatar rachanaaen unki hi garibi or dainyata kii kahani kahati he
 It is also not wrong that he was the creator of the common Indian
 unki rachanaaon main ve nayak hue, jise bhartiya samaaj achhut or ghrunit samajha tha
 He used the language of simple, easy and common language and presented his progressive ideas strongly to the society
 1936 main pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan kii adhyakshata karte hue unhone kaha ki lekhak swabhaav se pragatisheel hota he or jo aisa nahin he vah lekhak nahin he
 Premchand is the era promoter of Hindi literature
 unhone hindi kahani main aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad kii ek nai parampari shuru kii
 Despite being such a great creator, Premchand's life is not free from accusations
 premchand ke adhyeta kamalkishor goyanka ne apni pustak 'premchand : adhyayan kii nai dishaaen' main premchand ke jivan par kuch aarope lagaakar unke sahitya kaa mahatv kam karne kii koshish kii
 The main allegations against Premchand are- Premchand left his first wife without any reason and even after second marriage, he had a relationship with another woman, Premchand cheated Vinodashankar Vyas in 'jagran Brawl', Premchand's senior press Employee Pravasi Lal Verma Frauded, Workers Strike in Premchand's Press, Premchand Supports Flick When His Daughter Sick Took more
 kamalkishor goyanka dwaara lagaae gaye ye aarope premchand ke jivan kaa ek paksh jarur hamaare saamne laate hai jisamen unki insaani kamajoriyon jaahir hoti hai lekin unke vyapak sahitya ke moolyankan par in aaropon kaa koi asar nahin pad paaya he
 Premchand is often known as "munshi Premchand"
 premchand ke naam ke saath 'munshi' kab or kaise jud gaya? is vishay main adhikansh log yahi maan lete hai ki prarambh main premchand adhyaaapak rahe
 The teachers were often called Munshi ji at that time
 iske atirikt kaaysthon ke naam ke pehle sammaan swaroop 'munshi' shabd lagane kii parampara rahi he
 Probably, the word Munshi became rigid with the name of Premchand ji
 professor shukdev singh ke anusaar premchand ji ne apane naam ke aage 'munshi' shabd kaa prayog swayan kabhi nahin kiya
 He also believes that the word Munshi is a sign of respect, which fans of Premchand may have once imposed
 yah tathy anumaan par aadhaarit he
 But the authentic reason for adding the Munshi adjective to Premchand's name is that the letter 'hans' used to co-edit Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 jisaki kuch pratiyon par kanhaiyalaal munshi kaa puraa naam na chhapakar maatr 'munshi' chapa rahata tha saath hi premchand kaa naam is prakaar chapa hota tha- 
 Editor Munshi, premchand'hans' editors were Premchand and Kanhaiyalal Munshi
 parantu kalantar main pathakon ne 'munshi' tathaa 'premchand' ko ek samaj liya or 'premchand'- 'munshi premchand' ban gaye
 It's but natural
 saamaanya pathak praaia: lekhak kii kritiyon ko padhata he, naam kii sookshmata ko nahin dekha karata
 Today, Premchand's ornamentation of Premchand has become so orthodox that it is only by 'munshi' that Premchand's realization is made and by not saying 'munshi', Premchand's name seems incomplete
 premchand ne apni kala ke shikhar par pahunchne ke liye anek prayog kiye
 In the era in which Premchand took the pen, there was no solid legacy behind him nor was there any model of thought and progress, except in Bengali literature
 us samay bankim babu the, sharathchandra the or iske alaava tollstoy jaise rusi sahityakar the
 But by the time he composed a classic novel like Godan which is considered a modern classic
 unhone chizon ko khud gadha or khud aakaar diya
 When the freedom movement of India was going on, the expression he gave to both Hindi and Urdu languages through narrative literature gave rise to political stirring, passion and movement to all and made him powerful and this also made his writing powerful
 premchand is arth main nishchit rup se hindi ke pehle pragatisheel lekhak kahe ja sakate hai
 In 1936, he addressed the first conference of the Progressive Writers' Association as the Chairman
 unka yahi bhaashan pragatisheel andolan ke ghoshnaa patr kaa aadhaar bana
 Premchand gave birth to a tradition of storytelling in Hindi and an entire generation followed in his footsteps, Renu, Nagarjuna and after him Srinath Singh has written stories of rural environment in the 50-60s, in a way that tradition of Premchand Comes in line with premchand ek krantikari rachanaakaar the, unhone na keval deshbhakti balki samaaj main vyaapt anek kuritiyon ko dekha or unako kahani ke madhyam se pehali baar logon ke samaksh rakhaa
 He began to portray all the problems of society at that time
 usamen dalit bhi aate hai, nari bhi aati hai
 All these subjects later became major discourses of Hindi literature
 premchand hindi cinema ke sabase adhik lokapriy sahityakaron main se hai
 Satyajit Rai made memorable films on two of his stories
 1977 main shatranj ke khilaadi or 1981 main sadgati
 Two years after his death, Subramaniam made the film in 1938 on the novel Sevasadan in which Subbalakshmi played the lead role
 1977 main mrinal sen ne premchand kii kahani kafan par aadhaarit oka uri katha naam se ek telugu film banaai jisko sarvshereshth telugu film kaa rashtriya puraskaar bhi mila
 Godan in 1963 and embezzlement in 1966 became popular films
 1980 main unke upanyaas par bana tivi dharawahik nirmala bhi bahut lokapriy hua tha

 Ambedkar put his political vision in front of the world during the first round table conference on 8 August 1930 in London, according to which the protection of the exploited class is in its independence from both the government and the Congress
 hamen apana rasta swayan bananaa hoga or swayan


 raajnneetik shakti shoshito kii samasyaon kaa nivaaran nahin ho sakati, unka uddhaar samaaj me unka uchit sthaan paane main nihit he
 They have to change their bad way of living 


 They must be educated 


 a great need is to shake their sense of inferiority and to instill in them the divine dissatisfaction which is the source of all heights
 ambedkar ne congress or gandhi dwaara chalaaye gayi namak satyagrah kii aalochana kii
 Due to the increasing popularity and public support among his untouchable community, he was also invited to attend the second round table conference in London in 1931
 vahaan unki achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene ke mudde par gandhi se tikhi bahes hui
 But Brido agreed with Ambedkar's ideas
 dharm or jati ke aadhaar par pruthak nirvaachika dene ke prabal virdohi gandhi ne ashanka jataai, ki achhuton ko di gayi pruthak nirvaachika, hindu samaaj ko vibhajit kar degi
 Gandhi felt that the Savarnas should be given some period of their heart-rending to forget untouchability, but this argument was proved wrong when untouchability continued to be practiced by the upper-caste Hindus even decades after the Poona Pact
 1932 main jab britishon ne ambedkar ke vichaaron ke saath sahmati vyakt karte huye achhuton ko pruthak nirvaachika dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 The announcement of the Communal Award was the result of discussions at the Round Table Conference
 is samjhaute ke tahat ambedkar dwaara uthaai gai rajnatik pratinidhitiv kii maang ko maanate hue pruthak nirvaachika main dalit varg ko do voton kaa adhikaar pradaan kiya gaya
 Under this, Dalits could choose their representative by one vote and by another vote, there was freedom to choose representative of general class
 is prakaar dalit pratinidhi keval daliton kii hi vot se chunaa janaa tha
 With this provision, there was no longer any interference from the general class in choosing the Dalit representative
 lekin vahiin dalit varg apni duusari vot kaa istemaal karte hue saamaanya varg ke pratinidhi ko chunane se apni bhoomika nibhaa saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the Dalit candidate chosen by the Dalits could have kept the problems of Dalits well, but it was not necessary for the non-candidate to try to solve their problems
 gandhi is samay puna kii yeravada jail main the
 As soon as the announcement of the communal award, Gandhi first wrote a letter to the Prime Minister and demanded that it be changed
 lekin jab unako laga ki unki maang par koi amal nahin kiya ja rahaa he to unhone maran vrath rakhane kii ghoshnaa kar di
 Then Ambedkar said that "if Gandhi had kept this fast for the freedom of the country, it would have been good, but he has kept this fast in protest against the Dalit people, which is very regrettable
" jabaki bhartiya isaayiyo, musalamaanon or sikhon ko mili isi adhikaar ko lekar gandhi kii ore se koi aapatti nahin ai
 "he also said that Gandhi is not an immortal person
 bharat main na jane kitne aise logon ne janm liya or chale gaye
 Ambedkar said that he cannot renounce the interests of Dalits to save Gandhi's life
 ab maran vrath ke kaaran gandhi kii tabiyat lagaataar bigad rahi thi
 Gandhi's life was in great distress
 or puraa hindu samaaj ambedkar kaa virdohi ban gaya
 Seeing the increasing pressure in the country, Ambedkar reached Yerwada jail at 5 pm on 24 September 1932
 yahaan gandhi or ambedkar ke bich samjhauta hua, jo baad main puna pact ke naam se janaa gaya
 In this agreement, Ambedkar announced to waive the right to separate electorate received by the Dalits in the Communal Award
 lekin iske saath hin communal award se mili 78 arakshit siton kii bajaay puna pact main arakshit siton kii sankhya badha kar 148 karvaa lee
 Along with this, for the untouchables, adequate amount was allocated in education grant in every province and ensured the recruitment of Dalit people without any discrimination from government jobs and in this way Ambedkar saved the life of Mahatma Gandhi
 ambedkar is samjhaute se asamaadhani the, unhone gandhi ke is anshan ko achhuton ko unke raajnneetik adhikaron se vanchit karne or unhen unki maang se peeche hatane ke liye dawaab daalane ke liye gandhi dwaara khelaa gaya ek naatak qaraar diya
 In 1942, Ambedkar rejected this agreement, 'state of Myanority' has also expressed Poona Pact's displeasure in this book
 bhartiya republican party dwaara bhi isse pehle kai baar dhikkaar sabhaayen hui hai
 Ambedkar's grandfather's name was Maloji Sakpal, and his father's name was Ramji Sapkal and mother's name was Bhimabai

 So she was handled by Bua Mirabai, her father's elder sister

 Where is Ambedkar, his life is made up of three gurus and three worshipers

 He had three worshipers - Gyan, Swabhimaan and Sheela
 13 oktober 1935 ko, ambedkar ko sarkari lau college kaa pradhancharya niyukt kiya gaya or is pad par unhone do varsh tak kaary kiya

 In the same year, on 27 May 1935, his wife Ramabai died after a long illness
 ramabai apni mrityu se pehle tirthayatra ke liye pangarpur janaa chaahati thim par ambedkar ne unhe isaki ijazat nahin di
 Ambedkar said that in the Hindu pilgrimage where he is considered untouchable, there is no justification to go, instead he made a matter of making a new Pandharpur for him

 He strongly condemned the Congress decision to call Gandhiji's words Harijan to the untouchable community
 baad main, 1955 ke bibisi saakshaatkaar main, unhone gandhi par unke gujarati bhashaa ke patron main jati vyavastha samarthan karnaa tathaa angreji bhashaa patron main jati vyavastha kaa virodh karne kaa aarope lagaaya

 Following the Lahore resolution of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, Ambedkar wrote a 400-page book titled "thoughts on Pakistan, which analyzed the concept of" Pakistan "in all its aspects
 isamen unhone muslim lig kii musalamaanon ke liye ek alag desh pakistan kii maang kii aalochana kii
 It also argued that Hindus should accept Muslims from Pakistan
 unhone prastaavit kiya ki muslim or gaiyr-muslim bahumat vaale hisson ko alag karne ke liye punjab or bengal kii prantiy simaaon ko phir se taiyaar kiya janaa chahie
 He thought that Muslims could have no objection to retaking the provincial boundaries
 agar unhone kiya, to ve kaaphi "apni maang kii prakruti ko samaj nahin paae"
 Scholar Venkat Dhalipal said that Thoughts on Pakistan "stopped Indian politics for a decade"
 isane muslim lig or bhartiya rashtriya congress ke bich samvaad ke paathyakram ko nirdhaarit kiya, jo bharat ke vibhaajan ke liye rasta tay kar rahaa tha
 Although he was a staunch critic of the divisive communal strategy of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League, he argued that Hindus and Muslims should be separated and Pakistan should be formed because to lead the same country, due to ethnic nationalism More violence will develop within the country
 unhone hindu or musalamaanon ke sampradayik vibhaajan ke bare main apane vichaar ke paksh me automon samrajya or checkoslovakia ke vighatan jaisi aitihaasik ghatnaon kaa ullekh kiya
 He asked whether sufficient reasons existed for the establishment of Pakistan? And suggested that differences between Hindus and Muslims might have been possible to eradicate even with a less drastic step
 unhone likhaa he ki pakistan ko apane astitv kaa auchity siddh karnaa chaiye
 Communal issues have always been there even in countries like Canada, but even today the British and French live together, so can't Hindus and Muslims also live together
 unhone chetaya ki do desh banane ke samaadhaan kaa vaastavik kriyanvayan atyant kathinaayee bharaa hoga
 With the transfer of large population, there will also be a problem of border dispute
 bharat kii swatantraaa ke baad hone vaali hinsa ko dhyaan main rakh kar kii gai yah bhavishyavaanee sahi thi
 "what Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables?" With this book, Ambedkar sharpened his attacks on both Gandhi and the Congress, accusing them of hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne apni raajnneetik party ko akhil bhartiya anusuchit jati federation main badalte dekha, haalanki 1946 main yojit bharat ke samvidhan sabha ke liye huye chunaav main kharaab pradarshan kiya
 Later he was elected to the Constituent Assembly from Bengal where the Muslim League was in power
 ambedkar ne bombai uttar main 1952 ke pehle bhartiya aam chunaav main chunaav ladaa, lekin unke purv sahaayak or congress party ke ummidavaar narayan kajolkar se haar gaye

 which is a cruel tactic to enslave and suppress humanity and its proper name will be slander
 ek sabhyataa ke bare me or kya kaha ja saktaa he jisane logon ke ek bahut bade varg ko viksit kiya jise


 ek maanav se hin samajha gaya or jiskaa sparsh maatr pradooshan failaane kaa paryaapt kaaran he? Ambedkar was also a great critic of the practices of Islam in South Asia
 unhone bharat vibhaajan kaa to paksh liya par muslimo main vyaapt bal vivaah kii pratha or mahilaon ke saath hone vaale durvyavhaar kii ghor ninda kii
 They said, bahuvivaah or rakhel rakhane ke dushprinaam shabdon main vyakt nahin kiye ja sakate jo vishesh rup se ek muslim mahila ke dukh ke strot hai
 Take the caste system itself, everyone says that Islam should be free from slavery and caste, while slavery exists and got support from Islam and Islamic countries
 jabaki quran main nihit gulaamon ke nyaay or maanviya upachaar ke bare main paigambar dwaara kiye gaye nuskhe prashansaneey hai, islam main aisa kuch bhi nahin he jo is abhishaap ke unmoolan kaa samarthan karata ho
 Even if slavery ends, caste system will remain among the Muslims
 unhone likhaa ki muslim samaaj me to hindu samaaj se bhi kahi adhik saamaajik buraaiyaan he or musalmaan unhen " bhaichaare " jaise naram shabdon ke prayog se chhupate hai
 He also criticized the oppressive curtain practice of oppression of women in Muslim society as well as the discrimination against the Arzal classes by Muslims who were considered "lower class"
 unhone kaha haalaanki pardaa hinduon me bhi hota he par use dharmik manyata keval musalamaanon ne di he
 He criticized bigotry in Islam due to which the society has become very fanatical due to the lack of literate adherence to the laws of Islam and it is very difficult to change it
 unhone aage likhaa ki bhartiya musalmaan apane samaaj kaa sudhaar karne main vifal rahe hai jabaki iske vipareet turki jaise deshon ne apane aapako bahut badal liya he
 Both Hindu and Muslim groups suffering from "communalism" have ignored the demand for social justice
 10-12 saal hindu dharm ke antargat rahete hue babasahab ambedkar ne hindu dharm tathaa hindu samaaj ko sudhaarney, samta tathaa sammaan praapt karne ke liye tamaam praytn kiye, parantu savarna hinduon kaa hryday parivartan na hua
 On the contrary, he was condemned and even called the destroyer of Hindu religion
 useke baad unhone kaha tha kii, “hamane hindu samaaj main samanta kaa str praapt karne ke liye har tarah ke praytn or satyagrah kiye, parantu sab nirarthak siddh hue
 There is no place for equality in Hindu society
 ” hindu samaaj kaa yah kahana tha ki “manushya dharm ke liye hai” jabaki ambedkar kaa maananaa tha ki "dharm manushya ke liye hai
 "ambedkar said that such a religion has no meaning in which humanity has no value whatsoever
 jo apane hi dharm ke anuyaayion ko dharm shiksha praapt nahin karne detaa, naukari karne main baadha pahunchaata he, baat-baat par apamaanit karata he or yahan tak ki pani tak nahin milane detaa aise dharm main rahane kaa koi matlab nahin
 Ambedkar did not declare any renunciation of Hinduism for any kind of enmity and destruction of Hinduism, but he decided it with some fundamental principles which were not in sync with Hinduism
 13 oktober 1935 ko nasik ke nikat yevala main ek sammelan main bolte hue ambedkar ne dharm parivartan karne kii ghoshnaa kii, "although i am born as an untouchable Hindu, i will not die as a Hindu at all!" unhone apane anuyaayiyon se bhi hindu dharm chhod koi or dharm apnaane kaa aahvaan kiya
 He also reiterated this in several public meetings across India
 is dharm-parivartan kii ghoshnaa ke baad hyderabad ke islam dharm ke nizaam se lekar kai isai mishnariyon ne unhen karodon rupee kaa pralobhan bhi diya par unhonen sabhi ko thukraa diya
 Of course, he also wanted that the economic condition of the Dalit society should improve, but not by being dependent on the money, but by their hard work and organization
 iske alaava ambedkar aise dharm ko chunanaa chaahate the jiskaa kendra manushya or naitikta ho, usamen swatantraaa, samta tathaa bandhutav ho
 In any case, he did not want to adopt a religion which is riddled with apartheid and untouchability, nor did he want to choose a religion which has superstition and hypocrisy
 ambedkar ne dharm parivartan kii ghoshnaa karne ke baad 21 varsh tak ke samay ke bich unhone ne vishwa ke sabhi pramukh dharmon kaa gahan adhyayan kiya
 The main reason for his taking such a long time was that he wanted more and more followers to convert with him at the time he converted
 ambedkar buddha dharm ko pasand karte the kyonki usamen teen siddhanton kaa samanvit rup miltaa he jo kisi anya dharm main nahin miltaa
 Buddhism teaches wisdom, compassion and equity
