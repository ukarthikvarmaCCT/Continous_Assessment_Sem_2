 Mukesh Chand Mathur, popularly known simply as Mukesh, was a prominent playback singer of Hindi cinema
 mukesh kii awaz bahut khubasurat thi par unke ek dur ke rishtedaar motilal ne unhen tab pahachaanaa jab unhone use apni bahan kii shaadi main gaate hue suna
 Motilal took him to Bombay and allowed him to stay in his house
 yahi nahin unhone mukesh ke liye riyaaz kaa puraa intjaam kiya
 During this time Mukesh got the job of the lead artist in a Hindi film Innocent
 parshv gayak ke taur par unhen apana pehla kaam 1945 main film pehali nazar main mila
 The first song that Mukesh sang in a Hindi film was Dil Jalta Hai to Jalne De in which the actress Motilal did it
 is geet main mukesh ke adarsh gayak ke el sahagal ke prabhaav kaa asar saafe-saafe nazar aata he
 In 1959, he received the Filmfare Award for Best Playback Singing for the song 'subha Sikha Learned Hum Nae Sikhi Hoshiari' from the film Anari
 1974 main mukesh ko rajanigandha film main "kai baar yun bhi dekha he" gaanaa gane ke liye rashtriya film puraskaar mila
 He suffered a heart attack and died in 1976 while on a tour in the Detroit city of the United States
 inkaa janm 22 july 1923 ko ludhiana ke joravar chand maathur or chand rani ke ghar hua tha
 His elder sister used to study music and Mukesh used to listen to him with great fervor
 motilal ke ghar mukesh ne sangeet kii parmparik shiksha leni shuru kii, lekin inaki dili khwaahish hindi filmon main bataur abhinayta pravesh karne kii thi
 After coming to Mumbai, he got his first break in 1941 as an actor singer in the film "innocence"
 industry main shuruaati daur mushkilon bharaa tha
 But KL Sehgal liked his voice a lot
 inke gane ko sun ke el sahagal bhi duvidha main pad gayi the
 Mukesh had his own playback singing style in the 40s
 naushaad ke saath unki jugalbandi ek ke baad ek superhit gane de rahi thi
 At that time, most songs in Mukesh's voice were filmed on Dilip Kumar
 50 ke dashak main inhen ek nayi pahchaan mili, jab inhen rajkpur kii awaz kaha jane laga
 In many interviews, Raj Kapoor himself has said about his friend Mukesh that i am just a body, my soul is Mukesh
 parshv gayak mukesh ko film industry main apana makaam hasil kar lene ke baad, kuch nayaa karne kii chaah jaagi or isliye inhone film nirmaataa ban gayi
 Produced the film 'malhar' in 1951 and 'anurag' in 1956
 abhinay kaa shauk bachapan se hone ke kaaran ‘mashooqa’ or ‘anuraag’ main bataur hero bhi aaye
 But both these films flopped at the box office
 kehete hai ki is daur main mukesh aarthik tangi se jujh rahe the
 Mukesh did not succeed as an actor-producer
 galatiyon se sabak lete hue phir se suron kii mehfil main laut aaye
 In the last years of the 50s, Mukesh again reached the peak of playback singing
 yahudee, madhumati, anaadi jaisi filmon ne unki gayaki ko ek nayi pahchaan di or phir ‘jis desh main ganga bahati he’ ke gane ke liye ve filmafere puraskaar ke liye namankit hue
 Mukesh started the 60s with kalyanji-anandji, k dum-dum diga-diga, Naushad's Mere Pyaar Bhi Tu Hai, and SD Burman's songs and then composed by shankar-jaikishan in Raj Kapoor's film Sangam Kiya song, for which he was again nominated for Filmfare
 60 ke dashak main mukesh kaa kariyar apane charam par tha or ab mukesh ne apni gayaki main naye prayog shuru kar diye the
 According to the actors of the time, his singing was also changing
 jaise ki sunil dutt or manoj kumaar ke liye gaaye geet
 Mukesh made his debut in the 70s by singing live here, dying here
 us vakt ke har bade filmi sitaron kii ye awaz ban gayi the
 In 1970, Mukesh received a second Filmfare for the song Manoj Kumar's film Pehchan, and in 1972 he received the Filmfare Award for the third time for singing Manoj Kumar's film
 ab mukesh zyaadaatar kalyanji-aanndji, lakshmikant-pyarelal or aar di burman jaise diggaj sangeetkaaron ke saath kaam kar rahe the
 In 1974, Mukesh was given the National Film Award for the song Rajinigandha
 vinod mehara or firoz khan jaise naye abhinaytaon ke liye bhi inhone gane gaaye
 Even in the 70s, he gave many superhit songs like - one day the film Dharam Karam will be sold
 film anand or amar akbar anthony kii wo behtareen nagamen
 In 1976, Mukesh received the fourth Filmfare Award of his career for this title song of Yash Chopra's Kabhi Kabhi Kabhi and the song again brought a new life to his career
 mukesh ne apane kariyar kaa aakhri gaanaa apane dost raaj kapur kii film ke liye hi gaaya tha
 But in 1978, Mukesh died of a heart attack on 27 August, two years before the film's release

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga hindu dharm ek dharm he jiske anuyaayi adhikanshtah bharat ,nepal or morishas main bahumat main hai
 It is called the oldest religion in the world
 ise 'vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm' bhi kehete hai jiskaa arth he ki isaki utpatti maanav kii utpatti se bhi pehle se he
 Scholars consider Hinduism to be a blend of different cultures and traditions of India, which has no founder
 yah dharm apane andar kai alag-alag upasna paddatiyaan, mat, sampradaay or darshan samete hue hai
 It is the third largest religion in the world based on the number of followers
 sankhya ke aadhaar par iske adhiktar upaask bharat main hai or pratishat ke aadhaar par nepal main hai
 Although many deities are worshiped in it, it is in fact a monotheistic religion
 ise sanathan dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kehete hai
 The formal name of this religion in Indonesia is "hindu Agam"
 hindu keval ek dharm yaa sampradaay hi nahin he apitu jivan jeene kii ek paddati he
 Sanatana Dharma is one of the oldest religions on Earth; However, many scholars have many opinions about its history
 aadhunik itihaaskaar hadappa, mehrgarh aadi puratathvik anveshanon ke aadhaar par is dharm kaa itihaas kuch hazaar varsh purana maanate hai
 Where many signs of Hinduism are found in Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, bhagwaan shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, shivlinga, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 The Aryan civilization is called the Vedic civilization
 pehle drushtikon ke anusaar lagbhag 1700 isa purv main arya afghanistan, kashmir, punjab or haryana main bas gaye
 Since then, they started chanting mantras in Vedic Sanskrit to please their gods
 pehle chaar veda rache gaye, jinamein rugveda pratham tha
 Then came the Upanishads like texts
 hindu manyata ke anusaar veda, upanishad aadi granth anadi, nity hai, ishwar kii krupa se alag-alag mantradrashtaa rishiyon ko alag-alag granthon kaa gyaan praapt hua jinhone phir unhen lipibaddh kiya
 After the separation of Buddhism and religions, there was a lot of change in Vedic religion
 naye devtaa or naye darshan ubhare
 This is how modern Hinduism was born
 duusare drushtikon ke anusaar hindu dharm kaa mul kadaachit sindhu saraswati parampara se bhi pehle kii bhartiya parampara main he
 Bharatvarsha was named "hindusthan" by the ancient sages, whose apostrophe is "hindustan"
 "brihaspati aagam" ke anusaar: The word "hindu" is believed to be derived from "sindhu"
 sanskrit main sindhu shabd ke do mukhya arth hai - pehla, sindhu nadi jo maansarovar ke paas se nikal kar laddakh or pakistan se bahati hui samudr main milti he, doosraa - koi samudr yaa jalarashi
 According to the Rigveda river, they were seven rivers: Sindhu, Saraswati, Vittasta, Shutudri, Vipasha, Parushini and Askini
 ek anya vichaar ke anusaar himalay ke pratham akshar "hi" evam indu kaa antim akshar "ndu", in donon aksharon ko milakar shabd bana "hindu" or yah bhu-bhaag hindusthan kahalaaya
 At that time the word Hindu was used as nationality rather than religion
 chunki us samay bharat main keval vaidic dharm ko hi maanane vaale log the, balki tab tak anya kisi dharm kaa udai nahin hua tha isliye "hindu" shabd sabhi bharatiyon ke liye prayukt hota tha
 Later, due to the settling of only Vedic religions in India, foreigners started using this word in the context of religion
 aam taur par hindu shabd ko anek vishleshkon ne videshiyon dwaara diya gaya shabd mana he
 According to this belief Hindu is a Persian word
 hindu dharm ko sanathan dharm yaa vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm bhi kaha jaataa he
 Sapta Sindhu is mentioned in the Rigveda - the land where the Aryans lived first
 bhashavidon ke anusaar hind arya bhashaaon kii "s" dhwani irani bhashaaon kii "h" dhwani main badal jaati he
 Therefore, Sapta Sindhu converted to Aventan language and converted to Hinduism
 iske baad iraniyon ne sindhu nadi ke purv main rahane waalon ko hindu naam diya
 When Muslim invaders from Arabia came to India, they started calling the original religious people of India as Hindus
 chaaron vedon main, puraanon main, mahabharat main, smritiyon main is dharm ko hindu dharm nahin kaha he, vaidic sanathan varnashram dharm kaha he
 There is no single set of principles in Hinduism that all Hindus must follow
 ye to dharm se zyaada ek jivan kaa maarg he
 There is no central church or religious organization of Hindus nor any "pope"
 iske antargat kai mat or sampradaay aate hai or sabhi ko baraabar shraddha di jaati he
 The scriptures are also many
 fir bhi, wo mukhya siddhanth, jo zyaadaatar hindu maanate hai, in sab main vishwaas: dharm, karm, punarjanm kaa sansaarik chakra, moksh or beshak, ishwar
 Hinduism considers heaven and hell to be temporary
 hindu dharm ke anusaar sansar ke sabhi praaniyon main aatma hoti he
 Man is the only creature who can enjoy both sin and virtue in this world and can attain salvation
 hindu dharm main chaar mukhya sampradaay hai : vaishnav, shaiva, shakt or smart 
 But most Hindus do not classify themselves in any sect
 prachinkaal or madhyakaal main shaiva, shakt or vaishnav aapas main ladate rahete the
 The medieval saints tried to coordinate and described all the sects as interdependent
 sankshep main, hindutv ke pramukh tatva nimnlikhit hai-hindu-dharm hindu-koun?-- goshu bhakthirbhavedyasya pranave c drudha matih
 Reincarnation Belief: True Hinduism
 
 That is, one who has devotion in Gomata, who has a worshiping mantra, who believes in rebirth - he is a Hindu
 merutantra 33 prakaran ke anusaar ' hinan doodhyati sa hindu ' arthath jo hin ko dooshit samajhataa he vah hindu he
 According to Lokmanya Tilak- Asindho: Sindhuparyanta Yesya Bharatbhumika
 pitrubhuh punyabhushchaev sa vai hinduriti smritah
 
 arthath- sindhu nadi ke udgam-sthaan se lekar sindhu tak sampoorn bharat bhoomi jisaki pitrubhu tathaa punyabhu he, vah hindu kehalaata he
 The word Hindu is originally Pharsi, it means those Indians who are native and native of the boundary of Bharatvarsha described in the ancient texts of India, Vedas, Puranas
 kalika puraana, medni kosh aadi ke aadhaar par vartmaan hindu laa ke moolbhoot aadhaaron ke anusaar vedpratipaadit varnashram reeti se vaidic dharm main vishwaas rakhane vaala hindu he
 Although some people consider the mixed form of many cultures to be Indian culture, whereas it is not
 jis samskruti yaa dharm kii utpatti evam vikaas bharat bhoomi par nahin hua he, vah dharm yaa samskruti bhartiya kaise ho sakati he
 Some of the main points of the doctrine of Hinduism: hindu dharmagranth upanishdon ke anusaar brahm hi param tatva he 
 He is the essence of the world, the soul of the world
 wo vishwa kaa aadhaar he
 The world originates from it and the world dissolves in it
 brahm ek or sirf ek hi he
 It is trustworthy and beyond the world
 vahi param satya, sarvashaktimaan or sarvajna he
 It is timeless, continual and eternal
 vahi param gyaan he
 There are two forms of Brahma: Parabrahm and Upperbrahm
 parabrahm aseem, anant or rup-sharir viheen he
 It is beyond all virtues, but it has eternal truth, eternal mind and eternal joy
 brahm kii puja nahin kii jaati he, kyonki wo puja se pare or anirvachaneey he
 He is taken care of
 pranav brahmavakya he, jise sabhi hindu param pavitra shabd maanate hai
 Hindus believe that the sound of Aum is echoing throughout the universe
 dhyaan main gahare utarane par yah sunai detaa he
 The vision of Brahma is the central pillar of Vedanta philosophy and Hinduism has a unique contribution to the world
 brahm or ishwar main kya sambandh he, isamen hindu darshanon kii soch alag alag he
 According to Advaita Vedanta, when a human tries to know Brahma with his mind, then Brahma becomes God, because the human is under the control of a magical power called Maya
 arthath jab maaya ke aaine main brahm kii chaaya padati he, to brahm kaa pratibimb hamen ishwar ke rup main dikhaayi padataa he
 God creates the world with his magical power "maya" and rules over it
 is sthiti main haalaanki ishwar ek nakaaratmak shakti ke saath he, lekin maaya usapar apana kuprabhav nahin daal paati he, jaise ek jaadugar apane hi jaadu se achanmbhit nahin hota he
 Maya is the maid of God, but we are the masters of creatures
 vaise to ishwar rupahin he, par maaya kii vajah se wo hamen kai devataaon ke rup main prathit ho saktaa he
 In contrast, there is no belief in Vaishnavism and philosophies that there is no difference between God and Brahma - and Vishnu is God
 nyaay, vaisheshik or yoga darshanon ke anusaar ishwar ek param or sarvocch aatma he, jo chaitanya se yukt he or vishwa kaa sristaa or shaasha he
 However, all Hindus believe the rest: God is one and only one
 wo vishwavyaapee or vishwathit dono he
 Of course, God is virtuous
 wo swayambhu or vishwa kaa kaaran he
 It is a matter of worship and worship
 wo purna, anant, sanathan, sarvajna, sarvashaktimaan or sarvyaapee he
 He is beyond rage, but loves and blesses his devotees
 uski ichha ke bina is duniya main ek patta bhi nahin hill saktaa
 He upholds the moral order of the world and provides happiness and misery to the living beings according to their deeds
 shrimadbhagavadgita ke anusaar vishwa main naitik patan hone par wo samay-samay par dharti par avatar rup le kar aata he
 Other names of God are: Parameshwara, Paramatma, Vidhata, Bhagavan
 isi ishwar ko musalman allaah, khuda, isai god or yahudee yahveh kehete hai
 There are many gods in Hinduism, which are incorrectly called "gods" in English
 ye devtaa koun hai, is bare main teen mat ho sakate hai : One more thing that can be said is that most of the Vaishnava and Shaiva philosophy consider the first two ideas together
 jaise, krishna ko parameshwar mana jaataa he jinke adheen baaki sabhi devi-devtaa hai or saath hi saath, sabhi devi-devataaon ko krishna kaa hi rup mana jaataa he
 Scriptures do not recognize the third opinion
 jo bhi soch ho, ye devtaa rang-birangi hindu samskruti ke abhinn ang hai
 The main devas of the Vedic period were Indra, Agni, Soma, Varuna, Rudra, Vishnu, Prajapati, Savita and the goddesses - Saraswati, Usha, Prithvi, etc
 baad ke hindu dharm main naye devi devtaa aaye -- ganesh, ram, krishna, hanuman, kartikeya, surya-chandra or grah or deviyaan jaise-- durga, parvati, lakshmi, sheetala, sita, kaali, ityadi
 All these deities are mentioned in the Puranas and their total number is stated to be 33 koti
 puraanon ke anusaar brahma, vishnu or shiv saadhaaran dev nahin, balki mahadev hai or trimurti ke sadsy hai
 Apart from all this, cow is also worshiped as a mother in Hinduism
 yah mana jaataa he ki gaay main sampoorn 33 koti devi devtaa vaas karte hai
 Five major deities are revered in Hinduism beliefs
 ye ek ishwar ke hi alag-alag rup or shaktiyaan hai
 Jupiter is considered the guru of the gods
 puranic manyataon ke anusaar ve maharishi angira ke putr the
 He attained the position of Devguru through the hard tenacity of Lord Shiva
 unhone apane gyaan bal va mantra shaktiyon se devataaon kii raksha kii
 He is also revered as a Guru planet by the grace of Shiva
 guuruuvaar, guru brihaspatidev kii upasna kaa vishesh din he
 Shukracharya, the guru of the demons, is considered
 brahmadev ke putr maharishi bhrigu inke pita the
 It was Shukracharya who received the dead Sanjivani Vidya by performing harsh penance of Shiva, by which he used to burn his life again in the dead body
 brahmadev kii krupa se yah shukr grah ke rup main poojaneey hai
 Friday is the special day of worship of Venus
 hindu dharm ke anusaar har chetan praani main ek abhautik aatma hoti he, jo sanathan, avyakt, aprameya or vikaar rahit he
 According to Hinduism, not only human beings, but every animal and plant, that is, every living being has a soul
 bhagavadgita main bhagwaan shrikrishna dwaara aatma ke lakshan is prakaar bataae gaye hai: In any birth, according to the deeds done freely, the soul assumes the next body
 janm-maran ke chakra main aatma swayan nirlypt rahte hue aglaa sharir dhaaran karti he
 With the effect of good karma, a person can be born in an aristocratic home or vagina, while bad karma has to be born in a bad vagina
 janm maran kaa sansaarik chakra tabhi khatm hota he jab vyakti ko moksh miltaa he
 After that the soul attains its true satti-joy nature forever
 maanav yoni hi akelaa aisa janm he jisamen manushya ke karm, paap or punyamay fal dete hai or sukarm ke dwaara moksh kii prapti mumkin he
 The same beliefs about soul and rebirth are also the basis of Buddhism and Sikhism
 hindu dharm ke pavitra granthon ko do bhaagon main baanta gaya he- shruti or smriti
 Shruti is the supreme text of Hinduism, which is completely unchanging, that is, it cannot be changed in any era
 smriti granthon main desh-kalanusaar badlaav ho saktaa he
 Vedas under the Shruti: Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda Brahma Sutras and Upanishads
 veda shruti isaliye kahe jate hai kyonki hinduon kaa maananaa he ki in vedon ko paramatma ne rishiyon ko sunaaya tha, jab ve gahare dhyaan main the
 The Vedas were given to the disciples by the Guru according to the Shravan tradition
 har veda main chaar bhaag hai- samhita—mantra bhaag, brahman-granth—gadhy bhaag, jisamen karmkand samajhaaye gayi hai, aaranyak—inamen anya good baaten samajhaai gayi hai, upanishad—inamen brahm, aatma or inke sambandh ke bare main vivechna kii gayi he
 If there is a dispute between Shruti and Smriti then only Shruti will be valid
 shruti ko chhodkar anya sabhi hindu dharmagranth smriti kahe jate hai, kyonki inamen wo kahaniyaan hai jinako logon ne peedi dar peedi yaad kiya or baad main likhaa
 All Smriti texts praise the Vedas
 inako vedon se nichalaa str praapt he, par ye zyaada aasaan hai or adhikansh hinduon dwaara padhe jate hai 
 The major Smriti texts are: History - Ramayana and Mahabharata, Bhagavad Gita, Purana -, Manusmriti, Dharmashastra and Dharmasutra, Agam Shastra
 bhartiya darshan ke 6 pramukh ang hai- sankhya darshan, yoga, nyaay, vaisheshik, mimasaa or veydant

 People believe that the person who travels to these four dhams gets blessed

 For them, the idol is a simple instrument, in which the same formless God can be seen in any beautiful form as he wishes
 hindu log vastav main pathar or lohe kii puja nahin karte, jaisaa ki kuch log samajhate hai
 Idols are merely a means for Hindus to do devotion to God
 hinduon ke upasna sthalon ko mandir kehete hai
 There were no temples during the ancient Vedic period
 tab upasna agni ke sthaan par hoti thi jisamen ek sone kii murti ishwar ke pratik ke rup main sthapit kii jaati thi
 According to one view, due to the worship of Buddha and Mahavira idols and temples by Buddhist and Jain religions, Hindus too started building temples after being influenced by them
 har mandir main ek yaa adhik devataaon kii upasna hoti he
 The idol of the presiding deity is revered in the sanctum sanctorum
 mandir pracheen or madhyayugin bhartiya kala ke shreshthatam pratik hai
 Millions of pilgrims visit the temples every year

 Many South Indian scripts, such as the Mona script of Burma, the Javanese script of Indonesia and the Khmer script originated from this version
 ab to sanskrit likhane ke liye praayah devanagari lipi kaa hi istemaal hota he, lekin dakshin asia ke tamil-bhashi kshetron main 19veen sadi tak sanskrit likhane ke liye granth lipi kaa hi istemaal hota tha
 Scholars believe that the script book was used to write Vedic books for the first time in the 5th century
 20veen sadi ke prarambh main dharmik or vidvattapurna granthon main granth lipi ke badale devanagari kaa prayog hone laga or aam lok-kendrit prakashnon main vishesh chihnon ke saath tamil lipi kaa istemaal hone laga
 The script was also used to write tamil-sanskrit Manipravalam, a language composed of a mixture of Tamil and Sanskrit used for commentary on Sanskrit texts
 yah viksit hote-hote kaafii jatil lekhan pranali main parivartit hoti gai, jisamen tamil shabdon ko tamil vattalutu main or sanskrit ke shabdon ko granth lipi main likhaa jaataa tha
 By the 15th century, it had developed to such a level that both scripts were used in the same word - if the root of the word was Sanskrit based, it would have been written in the text, but if the word had Tamil suffixes, they would be in Tamil Vattelutu Used to be written jaise jaise manipravalam kii lokapriyata ghatati gai, is lekhan style kaa istemaal kam hota gaya, lekin 20veen sadi ke madhya tak multah manipravalam main likhi pustakon ke mudrit sanskarnon main isi parampara kaa nirvaah hota rahaa
 In modern times, the script is used by some traditional Tamil-speaking Hindus

 malayalam lipiyon or granth lipiyon main kai samantaayein hai
 When the text letters were used to write Sanskrit letters, it was called koleututu

 But currently Tamil has its own script
 aadhunik tamil lipi or granth lipi main kaafii samanta he, tamil main mahapraan aghosh, alpapraan ghosh or mahapraan ghosh shrunkhlaa ke akshar hataa die gaye hai
 See also: Tamil script granth lipi kaa is prakaar vargeekaran kiya ja saktaa he: The ancient and rhetorical texts are called Pallava texts

 Figurative texts were quite complex and ornate, so it is unlikely that it is used in everyday writing, perhaps it would be used only in inscriptions

 This text was used by the Chola dynasty between 650 and 950 AD

 In the "northern" type conjuncts, like the Northern scripts like Devanagari, two or more consonants are mixed to form conjuncts
 "dakshini" prakaar main aksharon ko ek duusare ke upar neeche kram main rakhaa jaataa he jaise ki dakshin kii kannada or telegu lipiyon main hota he 
 Northern type of ligature dakshini prakaar ke sanyuktakshar These conjuncts are easy to identify, so here are some examples: vishesh rup: If y and r are not at the beginning of a ligature, then they become and respectively
 yadi r kisi sanyuktakshar ke shuru main ho to ban ke sanyuktakshar ke ant main pahunch jaataa he 
 The numbers 1-9 and 0 in the script are as follows - harek granth lipi ke namoonay ke baad uskaa roman or devanagari lipiyon main lipyantaran bhi he

 The panchayati raj system of India consists of a gram panchayat or gram sabha at the village or small town level, which is a major component of the local self-government of India

 Panchayat has been an important place in the social, political and economic life of India since ancient times
 saarvajanik jivan kaa prayek pahalu isi ke dwaara sanchalit hota tha
 Panchayats also existed in the Vedic period
 gram ke pramukh ko gramani kehete the
 This was also done in the later Vedic period through which the king ruled the village

 In the Gupta period, the village was the smallest unit of governance, whose head was called "gramik"
 vah "panchmandal" athwa panchayat kii sahaayta se gram kaa shashan chalaata tha
 The "gram Vriddhas" were members of this panchayat

 Kurrum was an autonomous unit
 shashansatta ek mahasabha main nihit hoti thi jile gram ke log chunate the sabha apni samitiyon ke madhyam se shashan kaa kaam chalaati thi
 There were eight such committees which were responsible for maintaining peace and security in addition to performing various functions of public interest
 ye nyaay sambandhi kaary bhi karti thim
 The village was completely autonomous and thus the central government was free from many responsibilities
 muslim or maratha kaalon main bhi kisi na kisi prakaar kii panchayat vyavastha chalati rahi or prayek gram apane main swaavlambee bana rahaa
 During the British rule, the panchayat system got the biggest shock and this system became disjointed
 phir bhi graamon ke saamaajik jivan main panchayatein bani raheen
 Each caste or class had its own separate panchayats which governed its social life and those who violated the system and rules of the panchayat were severely punished
 shashan kii ore se in panchayaton ke kaaryon main hastkshep nahin kiya jaataa tha
 From the beginning, the policy of the British was that the work of governance should, as much as possible, remain in the hands of as many state employees
 iske parinamswaroop faujadaari or divaani adaalaton kii sthapana, naveen rajasav niti, police vyavastha, gamnaagaman ke sadhano kaa vikaas aadi kaarnon se graamon kaa swaavlambee jivan or sthaneey swaittata dhire-dhire samaapt ho chali
 But later on the British also realized that due to their policy of centralization, the governance burden is increasing day by day
 duusari ore rashtriya jagrati ke kaaran swaittashasan kii maang bhi bad rahi thi
 Hence they were forced to take steps towards decentralization
 prarambh main jila bordon or municipal bordon kii sthapana kii gai
 The Royal Commission on Decentralization of 1907 acknowledged the importance of panchayats and wrote in its report that the foundation of any permanent organization, so that the active cooperation of the public with the administration should be in the villages
 kamishan ne sifarish kii ki kuch chune hue graamon main, jo parsparik dalbandi or jhagadon se mukt hon, panchayatein sthapit kii jaaen or prarambh main unhen simit adhikaar die jaaen
 In 1915, the then Government of India accepted the recommendations of the commission in principle, but in practice they were completely ignored
 bahut hi kam graamon main panchayatein bani; jo baniin, ve bhi sarkaar dwaara puri tarah niyantrit thi
 According to the Government of India Act in 1919, the provincial governments were given certain powers of self-government and around 1920 the Gram Panchayat Acts were enacted in all the provinces
 sanyukt pradesh main 1920 ke panchayat act ke adheen lagbhag 4700 gram panchayatein sthapit kii gayi
 Panchayats were given limited powers in all the provinces
 ve janaswasthya, swatchta, chikitsa, jalavikas, sadakon, talabon kuon aadi kii dekhbhaal karti thim
 He also had some judicial rights
 ve adhiktam 200 ru
 kii chal sampatti se sambhddha mukademe le sakati thim or faujadaari ke mukademon main 50 ru

 Their main means of income were fines or donations
 parantu vaastaviktaa yah rahi ki pracheen panchayaton kii tulana main ye panchayatein purnataya prabhaavaheen thim, inke panch janata dwaara na chune jaakar sarkaar dwaara manonith kiye jate the tathaa aay ke saadhan na hone ke karan inaki aarthik sthiti shochaneey thi
 On the other hand, the masters of the national movement felt that the economic and moral decline of the villages could be prevented only by the re-establishment of the panchayats
 gandhi ji ke graamon ke liye dassutri kaarykram main panchayaton ko sudrudh banane kii baat mukhya thi
 They wanted to make panchayats the cornerstone of independent India's governance
 1937 main saat praanton main sthapit congressi sarkaron ke saamne bhi yahi adarsh tha
 In Uttar Pradesh, jeevansudhar Samitis were formed in many villages which were entrusted with the task of village development
 is prakaar 1947 i
 tak graamon main sahi panchayat vyavastha kaa abhaav hi rahaa
 Active efforts to revive this system started after independence
 uttar pradesh main san 1947 main panchayat raaj adhinium banaaya gaya
 Under the Constitution, the "directive Elements of Politics" stated that the state's principal duty was "to lead the organization of Gram Panchayats" and "to give them such powers and powers as to enable them to function as units of autonomous governance"
 Necessary to qualify

 The rights and responsibilities of the panchayats are more or less the same in every state

 In some specialized cameras however, the process of obtaining a usable exposure must include the use of some controls, manually or automatically, to ensure the photograph is clear, sharp and well-exposed
 Controls typically include, but are not limited to, the following

 Adjusting the speed of the shutter speed, the imaging medium is exposed to light for each display, during which the amount of time the shutter controls
 Shutter speed can be used to control the amount of light striking the plane of the image, the 'fast' shutter speed is less than the amount of light and the subject of the image and / or the amount of blur speed, the set of lighting conditions Electronic compensation for the color temperature associated with the given, so that the color in the white light frame will appear natural, such as registered on the imaging chip and ensure White balance process
 Mechanical, film-based cameras are served at this function by the choice of the operator of the film stock, or with color correction filters

 Psychoanalysis is a set of psychological ideas developed by Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud, to which some other psychologists also contributed
 manovishleshan mukhyat: maanav ke maansik kriyaaon evam vyavhaaron ke adhyayan se sambandhit he kintu ise samaajon ke upar bhi lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 Psychoanalysis has three uses: manorogi se baatcheet karne ke zariye uskaa upachaar karne kii vidhi or ek bauddhik anushaasan ke rup main manovishleshan kii sthapana zigmand froid ne kii thi
 Psychoanalysis has a profound effect on many disciplines of sociology
 stri- adhyayan, cinema-adhyayan or sahitya-adhyayan ne manovishleshan ke siddhant kaa istemaal karke apane shaastra main kai baarikiyon kaa samavesh kiya he
 There is only one branch of feminism known as psychoanalytic feminism
 froid kaa vichaar tha ki manushya ke avchetan ko alag- alag hisson main baant kar usee tarah se samajha ja saktaa he jis tarah prayogshaala main kisi rasayan kaa vishleshan kiya jaataa he
 The theory of the subconscious is based on the belief that a person does not know a part of his brain himself
 uski abhivyakti uske sapanom, bolte-bolte zabaan phisal jane or anya shaareerik bimariyon ke rup main hoti he
 In the 1880s, Fried treated the hysteria of a woman named Bertha Papenheim, in collaboration with Joseph Breuer, a physician in Vienna
 manovigyaan ke itihaas main bartha ko uske chhadam naam ‘anna o’ ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Soon there was a difference of opinion with Fried's Beur over the question of the role of sexuality in hysteria
 froid ko yakeen tha ki maansik sadame kii prakruti kaafii-kuch sexual ho sakati he
 In 1895, his findings were published in the form of Studies in Hysteria in the course of treating other patients
 froid ne histyria kii vyakhya ek aise dimaagi sadame ke rup main kii jise rogi dabaata rahata he
 The patient is reminded of that shock by psychoanalysis
 froid ke baad manovishleshan ke siddhant kaa aage vikaas karne kaa shrey zaak lakaan ko jaataa he
 Fried believed that man suppresses the feeling of suffering when he fails to fulfill his desires, sexual desires and needs
 is prakriya main uske bheetar apurna kaamanaayon ke prati aparaadh-bodh paidaa ho jaataa he jisase kuntha, atmalochna or ek seemaa ke baad aatm-hinata or aatm-ghrinaa kii anubhutiyaan janm leti hai
 All this work-business runs within the subconscious
 yah avchetan hameshaa dabaa hua nahin rahata or sapanom ke rup main yaa ghatnaon ke prati anayas yaa tarksangat na lagane vaali anukriyaaon ke rup main saamne aata he
 Let us divide Froyd mind into three parts
 unhone ahan ko yatharthamulak or atmmoh ko janm dene vaale do roopon main baanta he
 The arbitrariness of the real ego regulates the equation of action and reality pushing towards happiness
 isi ke prabhaav main apni kamanaayen puri karne ke saath-saath vyakti saamaajik apekshaaon par bhi karaa utarane kii koshish karata he
 The status of a paragon is like a parent in the psyche and he commands his kamatattva and ego
 yahi paraahan balak ko apane pita kaa praadhikaar sweekaar karne kii taraf le jaataa he
 Under this effect, the son's desire to attain mother is repressed so that in the process he can become empowered like father
 pitrusatta is silsile se hi punarutpaadit hoti he
 According to Fried's interpretation, in order to engage in diverse relationships with life and the world, the fictional formula between the son and the mother needs to be disbanded, and this role comes from the father's part
 pita ke hastkshep ke tahat putr ko maan ke prati apni yon-kaamana tyaagni padati he
 He sees that the father has a penis that the mother does not have
 use dar lagata he ki agar usne pita ke praadhikaar kaa ulanghan kiya to use bhi maan kii hi tarah hi badhiya hona pad saktaa he
 Under the dilemma of castration, a crisis called matrimonomy is born, which is another important formulation of Fried
 maatrumanogranthi kaa sankat bete ko maan kaa parityag karne kii taraf le jaataa he
 Freud has termed this denial of primitive self-repression of his untimely sexual desire for mother
 aatm-daman ke isi prasang se vyakti ke maanas main avchetan kii buniyaad padati he
 Zac Lankan reconsidered psychoanalysis enforced by Freud and removed him from the realm of sexual desire and established him in the realm of language
 saath hi unhone atmmoh ko janm dene vaale ahan kii behatar vyakhya kii jabaki froid ne is pahalu par zyaada gaur nahin kiya tha
 Lanka saw that according to Fried, while falling prey to the maternal gland, the child comes to the age of speaking
 arthath aadim aatm-daman ke aadhaar par jab uske avchetan kii neenv pad rahi hoti he, us samay kartta ke rup main uske kadam bhashaa ke pradesh main pad jate hai
 This is the moment when the child is aware of the birth and suppression of desire through language
 chunki kaamana kabhi puri nahin ho sakati isliye vah maan ke rup main aaajeevan apni khoyi hui vastu kii talash karata rahata he
 In order to break the combination of son and mother, Lakan underlined the role of mirror-image
 aaine main khud ko dekh kar arthath apane hi bimb se saakshaatkaar hote samay use maan ke saath apane antar kaa ehsaas hota he
 While reaching this stage, under the influence of the rules made by the father, the child has entered the symbolic world of language
 bimbaatmakataa se pratikatmakataa main jane kii yah prakriya lakaan ke anusaar teen nirnaayak kshanon ke kram main ghatit hoti he When the mother shows the child between the ages of six months to one and a half years, she identifies herself separately and becomes aware of her unified and separate existence
 lakaan ise hi atmmoh ke kshan kii shuruyaat maanate hai arthath isi jagah ahan kii atmmoh sambandhi kism kaa janm hota he or deh prem kaa lakshya banati he
 But another incident happens at this moment
 maan se khud ko bhinn paa kar vah do baaten sochataa he
 First, it is me and second, i am other than being monogamous with mother
 isi jagah paraayepan kaa ehsaas janm letaa he
 The image that the child sees in the mirror is indicative of that
 pah chhavi uski iyatta na ho kar uskaa sthanapann bimb he
 Lakan explains that this is why the phase of mirror-image starts the development of ego, but this foundation is laid on an understanding that is not realistic
 manovishleshan kii duniya main is baat par kaafii bahes he ki kya manorogi ke maanas tak usase baatcheet ke zariye pahunchaa ja saktaa he? kya manorogi ke bheetar manochikitsak dwaara kii gayi poochtacha ke prati pratirodh nahin hota? in sawaalon kaa jawaab talashne kii prakriya main paidaa hue matbhedon ke centre main maatrumanogranthi or shishu-youniktaa se jude hue mudde hai
 Psychoanalysts who attribute hysteria to psychiatry tend to overestimate the moment of birth of the maternal psychosis, while those of fragmented psychosis tend to have a much lower priority
