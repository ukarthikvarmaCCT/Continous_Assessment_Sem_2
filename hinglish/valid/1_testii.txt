 There were two important catalysts of the subprime crisis - the inflow of money from the private sector and the entry of banks into the mortgage bond market and the lenient behavior of lending to mortgage brokers, especially 2–28 loans at adjustable rates

 This debt and the explosive rise in housing prices led to a boom in housing construction and hence increased the overburden of unsold homes, causing skyrocketing US housing prices to come down in the mid-2006

 credit card yaa udhaar patrak ek chota plastic card he, jo ek visisth bhugtan pranali ke upyogkartaaon ko jari kiye jate he
 Through this card, the holder can buy goods and services with the promise that later he will pay for these goods and services
 card kaa jarikarta, card ke dwaara upabhokta ko udhaar kii seemaa detaa he jiske antargat ek upyogkarta kharidi hui vastuon ke bhugtan ke liye paise praapt kar saktaa he or nakad bhi nikaal saktaa he
 Credit card Today, credit card has become a daily necessity
 kharidari se lekar kai jaruri kaaryo main log credit card kaa prayog karte hai, lekin ek taraf jahaan yah suvidha kai arthon main logon ke liye laabhprad he, to iske kai nuksaan bhi dekhne main aa rahe hai
 Cases like misuse of credit cards occur in the news
 jab card se bhugtan karte hai, to uskaa abhilekh kahin na kahin to ekatrit hota hi he
 This is done by EDP processing: - jab graahak kisi utpaada yaa suvidha ke liye card dwaara bhugtan karata he, to card kii jaankaree minial pravishti, card imprinter, panit of cell terminal, virtual terminal main record ho jaati he
 The payment is then verified, then the seller / shopkeeper receives the payment
 carddharak kharidari ke liye bhugtan karata he, phir vyapaaree adhigrahak ko tranjection jamaa karata he
 After this the transaction is done only after the customer verifies
 iske baad baari aati habaiching kii
 After the transaction is authorized, it is stored as a batch
 adhigrahak card association ke dwaara jatthe ke rup main tranjection bhejtaa he
 Once the recipient receives this money, the shopkeeper receives the money
 aajkal kai credit card companiyon ne mobile phone ke jariye bhi credit card kaa kaam chalaane kaa praavdhaan kiya he
 According to them, this transaction is completely secure and requires a PIN number
 kisaan credit card yojana kaa uddeshy banking vyavastha se kisaanon ko samuchit or yathasamay saral evam aasaan tareeke se aarthik sahaayta dilaanaa he taaki kheti evam jaruri upkarnon kii kharid ke liye unke vittiya aavashyaktaaon kii purti ho sake
 Now many banks have also started card insurance schemes for their credit card holders
 tata eayeeji ne standard chartered or kotak mahindra bank ke card dharakon ke liye yah suvidha shuru kii he
 Every time you lose the card or misuse the card, you will get insurance of up to 50 thousand rupees
 lekin saal bhar main kul ek lakh rupye tak kii rakam kii bharpai hogi
 According to this scheme, when the bank informs the bank about losing the card, the company pays for all the incorrect usage done on the card before and after 12 hours
 swasthya beemaa, jivan beemaa, ghar or duusari mahatvapurn sampattiyon ke beemaa aadi to logon kii suraksha sambandhi jaagrukta kaa parichay dete hi hai
 Along with this, people have now started advising people to get insurance of knowledgeable credit cards
 credit card ke badhate upyog or usase jude tamaam dhokhaa-dhadi ke maamalon ke kaaran kisi anhoni se bachane hetu credit card kaa beemaa karana dharak ke liye atyant sahaayak siddh ho saktaa he
 If there is an accident with the holder due to credit card insurance, then the insurance company pays the credit card dues through credit shield facilities
 is suvidha ke tahat graahakon ko bainkon dwaara kai suvidhaayen di jaati hai
 It is up to the consumer whether they want to take all the facilities or they want to take advantage of some of the selected features
 isi aadhaar par unki premium raashi nirbhar karti he
 For example, under some facilities only the outstanding bills are paid on the credit card, under some schemes, the outstanding amount is deducted from the maximum amount and the remaining amount is given to the nominee
 credit card suvidhaayen pradaata vibhinn bank hi card ke bime kii suvidhaayen pradaan kar rahe hai
 This optional security is named Credit Shield
 credit shield ke tahat bakaayaa bhugtan suraksha kii seemaa sabhi bainkon main alag he
 This facility should be given to every credit card holder, it is also not necessary
 kuch bank apane bade yaa dirghakaalin card dharakon ko hi yah suvidha dete hai
 The holders of credit card insurance have to pay a fixed premium every month, which is deducted from the credit card itself
 iske alaava kuch bainkon kii yojanaon main bakaayaa bill kaa ek nishchit ansh premium ke rup main chukaana padataa he
 This premium also includes processing fee, service tax and education surcharge
 credit card lete samay bahut si baton kaa dhyaan rakhana chaiye, jo credit card ko ek acha sevak banaati hai va upayokta ko samasyaon main funsane se bachaati hai
 For this, credit card terms and rules should be read carefully
 kuch oonche rakam vaale credit card ko chhodkar kai aaajeevan credit card nickshulk die jate hai
 Therefore, such credit cards should be taken which do not have any initial fee
 yah sunishchit kiya janaa chaiye ki ye aaajeevan ho na ki ek saal ke liye
 Some customers take credit cards as a short-term loan facility
 jab graahak ek credit card se rin kaa boj nahin sambhaal paata, to vah apane rin anya card main hastantarit kar detaa he
 Therefore, it is necessary to facilitate the transfer of arrears
 yadi credit card ke bill kaa bhugtan samay se nahin kiya jaataa to bank bakaayaa raashi par byaaj dar lagaati he
 If taking credit as a short-term loan, the interest rate must be taken care of
 praayah yah dar 1
33 se 3
15 pratishat prati maheene kii dar se badalati rahati he or yah vibhinn credit card par nirbhar karata he
 Banks generally offer a loan period of 21–52 days
 yah credit card ke prakaar or lene-dene kii taarikh par nirbhar karata he
 If there will be a loan period without interest rate, then for the same number of days, you will have to pay the amount without interest
 rin seemaa credit card se kharch kii jane vaali yah adhiktam raashi hoti he
 It depends on the income of the user that the bank asks for when giving a credit card
 aisa mana jaataa he ki jitani zyada rin seemaa utana hi behatar
 But this advice is useless unless you use a credit card
 iske alaava card kho jane kii sthiti main ucch-seemaa ghaatak bhi ho sakati he
 a few years ago customer service for banks and credit cards was not as well developed
 lekin aajkal graahak seva sabase mahatvapurn he
 So it would be more beneficial to get a credit card from a bank with a better relationship
 sabhi bank graahakon ko inami ank yaa nakad vaapasi dekar aakarshith karne kaa prayaas karte hai
 Therefore, customers who use credit cards regularly should join this scheme
 ek acha credit vahiin he jise desh ke saath-saath videshon main bhi dukandaaron dwaara sweekaarya ho
 Relative to most outlets, a credit card with discounts and shopping facilities is extremely beneficial
 isamen petrol pump par sarcharge se mukti or bill ke bhugtan kii aasaana suvidhaayen bhi shaamil honi chahie
 Along with the use of credit cards, it is also necessary to keep a few things in mind: bhugtan itihaas: credit card seemaa tay karne main upayokta kaa credit card itihaas mahatvapurn hota he
 Paying credit cards late or having an overdraft can be a alarm bell
 yadi bank ye mahasoos karata he ki upayokta uske liye aise graahak hai jinka credit record behatar nahin he to vah credit card seemaa ko kam bhi kar saktaa he
 Loans: People often take loans without sufficient reason
 ye unki credit card itihaas par bada fark daalata he
 Taking too much debt cannot be called a better way
 vittiya yojanakaaron ke anusaar yadi kisi vyakti kaa 60 pratishat vetan rin chukaane main vyay ho jaataa he, to iskaa arth ye hai ki vah khatre kii seemaa main he
 If they have taken so much loan that they cannot repay easily, the bank may assume that it would be risky to give them too much credit limit
 credit itihaas : upayokta ke liye maatr ye hi aavashyak nahin he ki ve credit card kaa bhugtan samay se karte hai
 Use it in a better way, but it is also very important that they have some kind of practical relationship with other banks
 credit ank ke maamle main ek rin duusare ko prabhavit karata he
 Many banks provide clients with portfolio review reports
 yah unhen ye pahchaanane main madad karata he ki koun difalter he
 In such a situation, if the users pay the credit card loan on time, but do not pay the car loan on time, then it can prove negative for them
 lone ko niyamit rup se chukaane ke baavjood udhaar lene par bhi niyantran rakhana hoga
 Users should check their credit report
 shesh raashi ko jamaa kar dene kaa arth ye hai ki unka rin band ho gaya
