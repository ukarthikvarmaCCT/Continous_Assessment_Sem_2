 The term polymer was first used in 1833 by Jones Bergeilius
 1907 main liyo backland ne pehla synthetic polimar, phenol or formeldihide kii prakriya se banaaya
 He named it Bakelite
 1922 main harman stodinger ko polimar ke nae siddhant ko pratipaadit karne ke liye nobel puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya tha
 Earlier it was believed that these are clusters of small molecules called colloids, whose molecular weight was not known
 lekin is siddhant main kaha gaya ki palimar ek shrunkhlaa main kovelent bandha dwaara bandhe hote hai
 The term polymer consists of poly and meros
 ek hi prakaar kii monomer ikaiyon se banane vaale bahulak ko homopolimar kehete hai
 For example, the only monomer of polystyrene is styrene
 bhinn prakaar kii monomer ikaiyon se banane vaale bahulak ko kopolimar kehete hai
 For example, ethyl-vinyl-acetate is made up of different types of monomers

 bahut se saamaanya prayog kii vastuon main prayukt bahulkon ko unke saamaanya prachlit naamon se hi bulaate hai
 These names may be based on a particular individual or historical event, rather than in a standard way
 amareeki chemical sosayadi or aiupiasi ne inke namakaran ke tareeke bataaye hai, jo kaafii kuch milte julate hai, kintu samaan nahin hai
 The differences between the different naming methods are shown below: donon hi manakikrut paddatiyon main, bahulak naamon main unako nirmaan karne vaale monomer ke naamon ko darshane kaa prayaas kiya gaya he, bajaay ripet hoti up-ikai ke naam ke
 For example, a simple alkyne, polymer made from ethylene, is called polyethylene or poly-ethylene, while the bifacial form of its bicarbonate name has ceased to exist, ie the bicondylate has been removed

 chemical compounds of carbon are called carbonic compounds
 prakruti main inaki sankhya 10 lakh se bhi adhik he
 Organic compounds have a very important role in life

 Due to historical and traditional reasons, some carbon compounds are not classified as organic compounds
 inamen carbondioxide, carbon monooxide pramukh hai
 All biomolecules such as carbohydrates, amino acids, proteins, RNA and DNA are organic compounds
 carbon or hydrogen ke yogicon ko hydrocarbon kehete hai
 Methane is the hydrocarbon of the smallest molecule
 ethane, propen aadi iske baad aate hai, jinamein kramash: ek ek carbon judata jaataa he
 Hydrocarbons can be divided into three categories: ethane category, ethylene class and acetylene class
 ethane shrenee ke hydrocarbon santrupt hai, arthath inamen hydrogen kii maatra or badhaai nahin ja sakati
 Ethylene has a double bond between two carbons, in acetylene the triple bonded compounds are temporary

 a hygienic or corneal is the transparent part of the eye that has outside light and is repelled
 yah aankh kaa lagbhag do-tihaai bhaag hota he, jisamen bahari aankh kaa rangeen bhaag, putali or lens kaa prakaash dene vaala hissaa hote hai
 There is no blood vessel in the cornea but a network of nerves
 isko poshan dene vaale dravya vahi hote hai, jo aansu or aankh ke anya paardarshee drav kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Often the cornea is compared to the lens, but there is a great difference from the lens
 ek lens keval prakaash ko apane par girane ke baad failaane yaa sicodne kaa kaam karata he jabaki cornea kaa kaary isse kahin vyapak hota he
 The cornea actually allows light to enter the eyeball
 iskaa uttal bhaag is prakaash ko aage putali or lens main bhejtaa he
 In this way it is very helpful in vision
 cornea kaa gumbadakaar rup hi yah tay karata he ki kisi vyakti kii aankh main duuradrushti dosha he yaa nikat drushti dosha
 When viewing, external lenses are used to focus the image on the lens of the eye
 isse cornea main badlaav aa saktaa he
 In this case, by installing an artificial contact lens near the cornea, its thickness is increased to a new focal point
 kuch aadhunik kaantect lens cornea ko dobaaraa iske vaastavik aakaar main laane ke liye dabaav kaa prayog karte hai
 This process lasts until the ambiguity is gone
 cornea camere kii lens kii tarah hota he jisase prakaash andar jaakar retina par padataa he iske baad chitra banataa he, jise drushti-dhamni vidyut sanket rup main mastishk ke upyukt bhaag tak pahunchaa detii he
 If the cornea is defective, the retina does not form and the person becomes blind
 kai baar ankhon main sankraman, chot yaa vitamin e kii kami ke kaaran bhi cornea kharaab ho jate hai
 Coronary defects are treated by surgical treatment
 ye oparation saralata se ho jaataa he
 In this, the surgeons complete this activity by sublimating the nerves attached to the cornea without shedding blood
 kabhi-kabhi oparation ke dauraan cornea par kisi bahari vastu se kharonch bhi lag jaati he yaa phir palak kaa hi koi bal tuutakar is par kharonch bana detaa he
 In this condition the cornea is cured within a few days with some eye liquid medicines
 bahut se log apana cornea daan kar dete hai taaki koi unki ankhon se yah duniya dekh sake
 This cornea donation is actually called eye donation
 netradaan karne vaale vyakti kii mrityu ke baad uske cornea ko nikaalkar mashin kii sahaayta se uski koshika ghanatv dekhi jaati he
 Having more than three thousand cells in an area of one square millimeter is the hallmark of a good cornea
 cornea ke oparation kaa prachlit sabase pehle italy main viksit kiya gaya tha
 Subsequently, it was adopted in the United States and later adopted worldwide
 is oparation main rogi ke ek daant or uske paas kii kuch haddi ko nikaal kar taraasha gaya or us main belanaakaar lens ko baitaane ke liye ek chhed kiya gaya
 The teeth, including the lens, are first transplanted under the skin of the patient's cheeks or shoulders for two months, so that they are well joined together
 baad main unhen vahaan se nikaal kar aankh main pratiropit kiya jaataa he
 For this, the pit of the eye is first prepared well
 aankh kii shleshma vaali parat main ek chhed kiya jaataa he, taaki lens thodaa-sa baahar niklaa rahe or aasapaas ke prakaash ko grahan kar sake
 In recent years, a new alternative is to make the intrastromal corneal ring uniquely made of plastic in such a way that it can sit inside the cornea
 inke dizin kuch is tarah se bane hote hanki ye cornea ko dobaaraa se khoi hui akruti waapas lautaate hai or drushti sudhaarte hai
 This transplant does not require the removal of corneal tissue
 isamen rogi ko thik hone main bhi adhik samay bhi nahin lagata he
 This new cornea transplant is a surgical procedure in which the discs of the cornea are removed and the donated tissue is applied
 haalanki ye safaltaapurvak ho jaataa he lekin ye bahut hi aaramdaayak hota he or thik hone main bahut samay lagata he

 Upon regaining consciousness, Sardar tells Raka that Raju was the one who saved his life
 sardaar kii ladki kammo se raju pyaar ho jaataa he lekin kammo par nazar raaka kii bhi he
 Kammo explains to Raju that actually those people are good because rich people rob the poor and fill their chests and they loot the rich and return the money to the poor

 One day the gang invades the wedding of a village moneylender girl and along with the robbery party kills the newly married couple Raka
 yah baat raju par gaharaa asar karti he or vah police suparintendent ke paas jaakar bataata he ki daaku ab rajgad gaanv main daaka daalane vaale hai
 When the police superintendent tells him that he will kill Raka and all his companions, Bhola Raju understands that the police is as much a victim as these robberies
 vah bhagkar rajgad ja rahe daakuon ke giroh ko bich main hi roak letaa he or unako police ke intazaam ke bare main khabar karata he
 Raka doubts his point and gives one of his men a chance to go to Rajgarh and take stock of the situation
 lekin vah police kii goliyon kaa shikaar ho jaataa he
 Raka and his companions take Raju back to their base where Raju is produced in front of Sardar

 When Raka kills him, he decides to leave the robber's base but does not go at the insistence of Kammo
 raaka or sardaar bhi vahaan aa pahonchte hai or kammo unase kahati he ki usne raju ko shakti kii saugandh khaakar apana pati sweekaar kar liya he
 Raka becomes enraged and asks Sardar to shoot Raju
 jab sardaar is baat se munh pher letaa he to vah sardaar ko hi goli maar detaa he or kammo se jabaran shaadi karne kii koshish karata he or shaadi ke din raju kii narbali chadhaane kaa man bana letaa he
 Kammo escapes Raka to Bhauji, the wife of a robber robber who helps him and Raju escape
 donon bhagkar police suparintendent ke paas jate hai or police suparintendent kammo ko qaid kar daakuon kaa safaaya karne kaa huqm de detaa he
 Raju comes back to the bandits 'base and urges the bandits' wives to insist on robbing the bandits
 daaku apane bivi bacchon kii khaatir hathiyaar daalane ko taiyaar ho jate hai
 Raka falls alone to go to the police with him
 daaku apana adda chhodkar police kii ore ravaanaa hote hai or udhar kammo police ke dabaav main aakar police ko daakuon ke thikaane kii taraf le chalati he
 At one place, the two parties clash and on the instigation of Raka, the bandits again take up arms and make up their mind to take on the police
 tabhi raju daakuon ke bivi bacchon ko lekar donon dalon ke bich main aakar khadaa ho jaataa he or phir se daakuon se hathiyaar daal dene kaa aagrah karata he
 This time, all the bandits, including Raka, put their weapons and surrender themselves and their family to the police
 raju police suparintendent se nivedan karata he ki inako phaansi kii sazaa nahin milani chaiye
 The police superintendent assures everyone that the robbers will surely get the punishment for their actions but not the death penalty

 System development life cycles follow important steps that are required of the developer such as planning, analysis, design and implementation and are explained in the section below
 kai systams vikaas jivan chakra astitv main hai
 The oldest model, originally thought to be "the systems development life cycle", is the waterfall model, a sequence of steps in which the output of each phase proceeds to the next stage
 ye charan saamanytah usee aadharbhoot kadamon kaa anusaran karti hai lekin kai vibhinn waterfol kaary pranaliyaan qadamon ko alag naam detii hai or kadamon kii sankhya main 4 or 7 ke bich kaa antar hota he
 No system development life cycle model is perfect, but the steps can be quality and divided into different stages
 bhavi pariyojna kaa ucch stareey rup utpann karne or pariyojna kaa lakshya nirdhaarit karne ke liye
 Feasibility studies are sometimes used to present a project to higher management in an effort to obtain funding
 pariyojnaon ko aamtaur par vyavhaaryata ke teen kshetron main moolyankit kiya jaataa he: arth sambandhi, kaary sambandhi or takanic sambandhi
 iske alaava, iskaa prayog prayojna ko patari par rakhane ke sandarbh main or MIS team kii pragati kaa moolyankan karne main bhi hota he
 MIS also complements those steps
 is charan ko vishleshan charan bhi kaha jaataa he
 The purpose of system analysis is to decide where the problem lies in attempting to fix the system
 is charan main system ko vibhinn hisson main todna or sthiti ke vishleshan ke liye aarekh kheenchna shaamil hai
 The purpose of the project is to analyze the segmented tasks that need to be built and to keep the user involved so that definite requirements can be defined
 aavashyak gadering ko kabhi-kabhi vistrut or sahi jaruraton ko praapt karne ke liye graahak ke saath-saath seva pradaataaon ke vyaktigat / team kii zarurat padati he
 The system design describes functions and operations in detail, including table layouts, business rules, process diagrams, and other documentation
 is charan kaa nirgaman naye system ko maapdand ke rup main yaa upsystem ke rup main varnan karegaa
 In the design phase, requirements are taken as their initial input
 in aavashyaktaaon kii pahchaan sweekrut aavashyak dastauez main ho jaati he
 For each requirement, a set of one or more design components will be offered as a result of interviews, workshops and / or ideal efforts
 The design component describes the desired software features in detail and is usually included with functional hierarchy diagrams, table layout diagrams, business rules tables, business process diagrams, ciudocodes, and a complete nostalgic complete data dictionary
 in dijin avyavon ko paryaapt vistaar ke saath software kaa varnan karne ke liye nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he jisamen kushal programmers nunetan atirikt nivesh ke saath software deveopment kar sake
 Modular and subsystems programming code is completed during this phase
 ikai pareekshan or mapank pareekshan is str main developaron ke dwaara kii jaati hai
 This phase is integrated with the next phase in which individual modules will need to be tested before integration of the main project
 software pareekshan main code kaa vibhinn staron par pareekshan hota he
 Unit, system and user acceptance tests are performed multiple times
 yah ek grey aria he kyonki isamen kai vichaar astitv main he ki agar koi punrariti ghatit ho jaae to pareekshan ke charan kya ho or kitni ho
 Recurrence is usually not part of the waterfall model but some occur at this stage
 system ke failaav main vriddhiyon yaa system ke samaapan se pehle parivartan or seva mukt karnaa sammilit he
 Maintenance of the system is an important aspect of SDLC as new changes will be implemented in the organization as the main employee change places; Which will require system modern reasons
 system deveopment life saaikal charan pariyojna gatividhi ke liye programatic guide ke rup main kaam karti he or pariyojna ke vishay se kaam karti he or pariyojna ke vishay se gahare milan karke pariyojnaon ko chalaane kaa lacheela lekin anukool rasta pradaan karti he
 Each of the objectives of the SDLC phase is defined in this department with a summary of the key accomplishments, an explanation of the tasks assigned, and the associated controlled objectives for effective management
 pariyojnaayen karyanvit karne ke saath har SDLC charan ke dauraan niyantran uddeshyon kaa nirmaan or sanchaalan karnaa pariyojna prabandhak ke liye bahut sankatpurna he
 The control objective helps provide a clear statement of the desired or proposed outcome and should be used within the entire SDLC process
 control objactives ko mukhya virgon main samoohikrut kiya ja saktaa he or jaisaa ki chitra main darshaya gaya he, yah SDLC charnon se judaa hua he
 The management and control of any initial SDLC will require every project to list and hold some of the tasks required to build some degree of work constraint structure
 WBS or sabhi programatic saamagree pariyojna notebook ke "project diskripshan" vibhaag main rakhaa janaa chahie
 The WBS format is mostly assigned to the project manager who sets it up in such a way that the project work is best interpreted
 kuch mukhya kshetra hai jo WBS main SDLC niti ke ansh ke rup main zarur varnit kiye jaae
 nimnlikhit aarekh mukhya kshetron kaa varnan karata he jo pariyojna prabandhak dwaara nirmit tareeke main WBS main vyavyachit kii jaayegi
 The upper division of the work barrier structure should identify the main phases and project milestones in a concise manner
 iske atirikt, upari vibhaag ko sampurna vishay kaa avlokan or pariyojna kii samay seemaa pradaan kerani chahie or pariyojna anumodan ke liye aarambhik pariyojna vivaran prayaas kaa bhaag hoga
 The Central Department of WBS is based on seven system development life cycles as a guide to the WBS work development
 WBS tatv milstons se bana hona chahie or "kriyalap" ke virodh main "kaary" or ek nishchit avadhi rahani chahie
 a mediocre issue is required in every task
 a WBS task may depend on one or more activities and may require close collaboration with other tasks, whether internal or external
 pariyojna kaa koi bhaag jise contractars se samarthan kii zarurat ho, uske paas SDLC charnon se uparyukt kaaryon ko shaamil karne ke liye likhit statement of work honi chahie
 The development of SOW does not occur during any particular phase of the SDLC but evolves from the SDLC process to include work that may be conducted by external resources such as contractors
 besalines system deveopment life saaikal kaa ek mahatvapurn bhaag hai
 These baselines are constructed after four to five steps of the SDLC and are important for the iterative nature of the model
 Every baseline in SDLC is considered a milestone
 aadhunik computing duniya main kuch log apane system deveopment life saaikal ke liye sakht waterfol model kaa prayog karenge kyonki kai aadhunik karypranaliyaan is soch ko hataa chuki hai
 Some argue that SDLC no longer applies to models such as Agile Computing but is still widely used in technology circles
 SDLC abhyaas ko software deveopment ke paaramparik model main laabh hota he jo apane aap ko sanrachit maahaul main zyada laabh pahunchaati hai
 The use of the SDLC function is disadvantageous when variable development is required or where the stakeholder needs to regularly monitor how the software is designed
 SDLC ko takat yaa kamajoriyon ke najariyein se dekhne ke bajaay bahut zyada jaruri he SDLC model se sarvottam karypranaliyon ko lenaa or ise dijin kiye software ke liye jo kuch bhi zyada uparyukt ho us par lagu karnaa
 An alternative to SDLC is rapid application development, which combines prototyping, joint application development, and implementation of CASE tools
 RAD ke laabh gati, kam vikaas laagat or vikaas prakriya main sakriy upyogkarta yogadan
 Therefore, the waterfall model is the oldest real SDLC model, so the most effective model should not be taken for granted

 Whatever it is, the world of technology development is demanding that the system have effective functionality that will help help desk technicians / administrators or information technology experts / analysts

 Sirpur Lakshman Temple gita tandon ek bhartiya stantsvuman he, vah khataron ke khiladi sijan 5 se prasiddh hui
 Tandon was born in a Punjabi family in Mumbai
 vah bahut hi kathor vaataavaran main paidaa hui thi
 He lost his parents at a very young age
 15 varsh kii aayu main unki shaadi ho gayi thi or unhone 2 baccho ko janam diya tha
 Tandon completed her matriculation, Por started her career as a dancer
 unke rukh ke kaaran unhen ek stantsvuman kaa kaam diya gaya
 She performed stunts in artists like Deepika Padukone, Parineeti Chopra, Katrina Kaif and Bipasha Basu and in many films like Chennai Express, Hasi To Fasi, Ragini MMS, Singh Saab The Great and Lamha

 Onion was a medical psychologist from Switzerland who is famous for his work on child development
 piyaaje, vikasaatmak manovigyaan ke kshetra main ek badi hasti hai
 We are indebted to Piaget for many erudite concepts that still have the ability and charm to last today, such as adjustment / assimilation, customizable object stability, autism, conservation, and hypothetical-corporate thinking
 bacchon ke sakriy, rachanaatmak vichaarak hone kii vartmaan drushti ke liye bhi ham, wiliam james tathaa jon dui ke saath-saath, piyaaje ke rini hai
 Piag had a unique talent for observing children
 uske saavdhaneepurvak kiye gayi prekshanon ne hamen yah khojane ke sooyeeboojh bhare tareeke dikhaaye ki bachche kaise apane sansar ke saath kriya karte hai or talmail bithaate hai
 Piaget taught us to find certain things in cognitive development, such as the shift from pre-operative thinking to tangible operational thinking
 usne hamen yah bhi dikhaaya ki kaise bacchon ko apane anubhavon kii sangat apni yojanaon, sangyanatmak dhaanchon or saath hi saath apni yojanaon kii sangat apane anubhavon se bithaane kii jarurat hoti he
 Piaget also showed that if the structure of the environment is such that there is a facility to move slowly from one level to another, then there is a possibility of cognitive development
 ham ab is prachlit manyata ke liye bhi uske rini hai ki avadharanaen achaanak apane puure swaroop main prakat nahin ho jaatin, balki ve aisi choti-choti aanshik uplabdhiyon kii shrinkhalaa se hoti hui viksit hoti hai jinke parinaam swaroop kramshah adhik paripurna samaj paidaa hoti he
 Piagas have had a great impact on education, especially during early and middle childhood
 uski mimasaa se nikle teen siddhanton kaa aaj bhi shikshakon ke prashikshan par or kaksha ke bheetar apanaaye jane vaale taur tareekon par vyapak asar hota he
 In the class following the Piag, children are encouraged to explore things by themselves, spontaneously / spontaneously acting with the surroundings
 pehle se taiyaar gyaan ko shabdic rup se prastut karne ke bajaay, shikshak aisi vividh gatividhiyon kii suvidha pradaan karte hai jo khojane ko badhaava detii hai- jaise kala, pahelion, mej vaale khel, vibhinn paridhaan, chijen banane vaale guttey, kitaaben, naapane ke aujaar, sangeet, vaadya tathaa or bhi bahut kuch
 Piaget class does not try to increase the speed of development
 piyaaje maanata tha ki bacchon ke seekhney ke upyukt anubhav unki taatkaalik soch se hi viksit hote hai
 Teachers look at children carefully, listen to them, and provide them with experiences in which they can practice newly discovered plans and challenge the wrong ways of looking at their world
 lekin shikshak bacchon par koi naye kaushal nahin thopate jab tak ve unamem ruchi or unke liye taiyaari nahin dikhaate, kyonki aisa karne se ve vayaskon ke sutron ko satahi dhang se sweekaar kar lete hai, par usase sachhee samaj paidaa nahin hoti
 Piaget's theory assumes that all children go through the same sequence of development, but their pace / pace varies
 isliye shikshakon ko alag-alag vidhyaarthiyon ke liye or chote-chote samoohon ke liye gatividhiyon kii yojana bananaa chahie, naa ki ek saath puri kaksha ke liye
 In addition, when comparing educational progress, teachers compare each child with his or her previous position
 unki ruchi is baat main kam hoti he ki bachche kinhin maanak staron ke saapeksh yaa ki samaan umr ke bacchon ke ausat pradarshan ke saapeksh kaisaa pradarshan karte hai
 Piaget's theory could not remain free from challenges
 uske in kshetron par prashn uthaaye gayi hai : How children think about moral issues; The onion aroused interest in it
 unhone bahut adhik gaharaai se chaar se baarah saal ke umr ke bacchon kaa avlokan or saakshaatkaar kiya
 Piazza saw the children playing marbles to know how the children thought about the rules of the game
 unhone bacchon se naitik muddon ke bare main bhi baat kii
 Piaget found that when children think about morality, they go through two different stages
 chunki chote bachche bahari satta vaali naitikta ke str par hote he, ve kisi ke vyavhaar ke bare main sahi yaa galat kaa nirnay us vyavhaar se hone vaale parinaamon ko dekhakar lete hai, na ki vyavhaar kartta ke uddeshyon ke aadhaar par
 For example, the incident of breaking 12 cups in an accident is worse for them than a cup that was intentionally broken
 jaise bachche swatantra avasthaa par aane lagate hai, vaise-vaise kisi kaam ko karne vaale kaa uddeshy / iraadaa unke naitik chintan kaa ek aavashyak bindu banane lagata he
 Children who think ethically on the basis of external power also believe that the rule is an unchangeable thing and that these rules are made by a powerful authority
 pyaaje ne chote bacchon ko sujhaayaa ki vah kanche ke khel ke nae niyam banaaen, to chote bacchon ne manaa kar diya
 The older children, on the other hand, accepted the change and recognized that the rules were made just for our convenience, which could be changed
 bahari satta ke aadhaar par naitik chintan karne vaale bachche 'turant nyaay' kii dharna main bhi vishwaas rakhte hai
 That is, if a rule is broken then punishment should also be met
 chote bachche maanate hai ki agar kisi cheez ko khandit kiya yaa todaa gaya he tab yah kaam apane aap sajaa se jud jaataa he
 That is why whenever young children do something wrong, they start looking around them worrying that they will get punishment
 turant nyaay kaa siddhanth yah bhi kahata he ki agar kisi ke saath kuch durbhagyapurna hua ho to us vyakti ne jarur pehle kuch kiya hoga, jiske parinaswaroop aisa hua
 Older children who seem to have the freedom of morality recognize that punishment is only given when someone has seen something wrong and even after that punishment is not necessary
 naitik tark ko lekar is tarah ke parivartan kaise aate hai? piyaaje maanate hai ki jaise-jaise bachche bade hote he unki soch saamaajik muddon ke bare main gahari hoti chali jaati he
 Onion believes that social understanding comes from mutual dealings with peers
 jin saathiyon ke paas ek jaisi shakti or ohada hota he vahaan yojanaon ke bich samjhauta kiya jaataa he or sahamat na hone par tark diya jaataa he or aakhir main sab kuch thik ho jaataa he
 In parent and child relationships where the parent has power but not the children, it is less likely to develop an understanding of moral reasoning because most rules are given in an orderly manner
 super mario cart game ek racing video game he or isko pehali baar san 1992 main nintando dwaara banaaya or market ke andar utaara gaya tha

 Electroscopes are used in the detection and measurement of electric charge
 vidyutdarshi sabase pracheen vidyut upkaran he
 Prior to 1787, several types of electrification were made which mainly used repulsion of charged pith faction

 An extremely thin gold sheet hangs from a flat brass rod

 This gold-sheet rod is insulated by amber in a metal box

 If the swatch is touched by a charged object, both the rod and the gold sheet are charged
 parsparik pratikarshan ke kaaran swarnpatr chad se dur hat jaataa he
 The deflection of the gold sheet is proportional to the amount of the residue
 swarnpatr kaa vikshep ek paimaane par napa ja saktaa he
 Use microscopes for accurate knowledge of deflection
 kuch vidyutdarshi main pital kii chad ke neeche vaale chor par do swarnpatr lage rahete hai
 Charge and voltage are related to the following formula - swarnpatr ke vikshep se aavesh kii maatra kaa maapan ho saktaa he or vidyuddarshi kii dharita nishchit hoti he
 Hence, the potential can also be measured
 saadhaaran swarnpatr vidyuddarshi kii dharita bahut kam hoti he; is kaaran yah vibhav ke pratikam sugrahi hoti he
 To increase its sensitivity, we use only one letter as well as a capacitor
 aise vidyutdarshi ko sangharitra vidyutdarshi kehete hai
 After the invention of radio activation, it was discovered that some objects emit rays that discharge a charged body
 yadi kisi radioacti tatv ke paas ek aaweshit vidyuddarshi rakhaa jaae to vah niraveshit hone lagegaa or swarnapatrika vikshep ghatane lagegaa
 The rate of decreasing deflection will be proportional to the power of the radioactive rays

 Surah Mohsin has translated this sura into English: al-iftiyaarishwar ke naam par, jo dayavan he:- When Jannat breaks into pieces; When stars fall apart and disintegrate; And when the seas burst forth; And when the graves are overturned, the inner ones come out; Then a person comes to know what has been sent with him and what is left behind , o man! What is it that has made you careless to that generous God of yours? Who saved you, gave this perfect figure and gave you your authorized share; In whatever form He willed, He put you together
 Nay! But you deny the ad-din
 But verily, over you to watch you, Kirâman Kâtibîn writing down, They know all that you do
 Verily, the Abrâr will be in Delight ; And verily, the Fujjâr will be in the blazing Fire, Therein they will enter, and taste its burning flame on the Day of Recompense, And they will not be absent therefrom
 And what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is? Again, what will make you know what the Day of Recompense is? the Day when no person shall have power anything for another, and the Decision, that Day, will be with Allâh

 bhartiya swatantraaa adhinium, 1947 main bharat kii samvidhan sabhako purna prabhusatta sampann nikaay ghoshit kiya gaya
 On the midnight of 14-15 August 1947, that assembly assumed full powers to govern the country
 adhinium kii dhara 8 ke dwaara samvidhan sabha ko purna vidhaayi shakti praapt ho gai
 But at the same time it was felt that it would be necessary to maintain a distinction between the Constitution-making work of the Constituent Assembly and its ordinary work as a Legislature
 samvidhan sabha kii ek alag nikaay ke rup main pehali baithak 17 navambar 1947 ko hui
 Its President was Dr

 There was a majority in favor of the proposal
 26 janvari 1950 ko swatantra bharat ke ganraajya kaa samvidhan lagu ho gaya
 This led to the establishment of a complete parliamentary system, including the modern institutional structure and all its other branch-branches
 samvidhan sabha bharat kii asthaayee sansad ban gai
 After the first general elections on the basis of adult suffrage, the Parliament continued to function in the same manner until the constitution of the new constitution

 Parliament is the supreme representative body of the people in Indian democracy
 isi madhyam se aam logon kii samprabhutaa ko abhivyakti milti he
 Parliament is the proof that the public is at the top of our political system, public opinion is paramount
 ‘sansadeey’ shabd kaa arth hi aisi loktantratmak raajnneetik vyavastha he jahaan sarvocch shakti logon ke pratinidhiyon ke us nikaay main nihit he jise ‘sansad’ kehete hai
 Under the Constitution of India, the Federal Legislature is called 'parliament'
 yah vah dhuree he, jo desh ke shashan kii neenv he
 The Indian Parliament is made up of the President and two Houses — the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha
 vaise to bharat kaa raashtrapati sansad kaa ang hota he, phir bhi vah donon main se kisi bhi sadan main na to baithta he, na hi uski charchaaon main bhaag letaa he
 The President invites both the Houses of Parliament from time to time for a meeting
 donon sadanon dwaara paas kiya gaya koi vidheyak tabhi kanoon ban saktaa he jab raashtrapati us par apni anumati pradaan kar de
 Not only this, when both the Houses of Parliament are not in session and the President feels that immediate action is necessary in these circumstances, then he can issue an ordinance
 is adhyadesh kii shakti evam prabhaav vahi hota he jo sansad dwaara paas kii gai vidhi kaa hota he
 At the beginning of the session after every general election to the Lok Sabha and at the beginning of the first session of every year, the President addresses both the Houses of Parliament simultaneously
 vah sadanon kii baithak bulaane ke kaarnon kii sansad ko soochna detaa he

 jis sadan ko koi sandesh is prakaar bheja gaya ho vah sadan us sandesh main likhe vishay par suvidhanusaar shighrata se vichaar karata he
 Certain types of Bills can be introduced only after receiving the recommendation of the President or any further action can be taken on them
 jaisaa ki iske naam se pataa chalata he, rajyasabha rajyon kii parishad he
 It represents the people indirectly
 rajyasabha ke sadsy kaa chunaav rajya vidhaan sabhaaon ke chune hue vidhayak karte hai
 The number of representatives of each state depends mostly on its population
 is prakaar,chhattisgarh ke rajyasabha main 5 sadsy hai, uttar pradesh ke rajyasabha main 31 sadsy hai
 Manipur, Mizoram, Sikkim, Tripura etc
 are only one member of smaller states
 rajyasabha main 250 tak sadsy ho sakate hai
 It consists of 12 members nominated by the President and elected by 238 States and Union Territories

 kuch paristhatiyon main sansad ko purna karyavadhi samaapt hone se pehle hi bhang kiya ja saktaa he
 Parliament can extend the term of the Lok Sabha in case of emergency
 yah ek baar main ek varsh se adhik nahin ho sakati
 The two Houses of Parliament have equal powers and status in all areas except in certain cases
 koi bhi gaiyr-vittiya vidheyak adhinium banane se pehle donon main se prayek sadan dwaara paas kiya janaa aavashyak he
 The Rajya Sabha has the same powers as the Lok Sabha in important matters such as impeachment of the President, removal of the vice-president, amending the Constitution and removal of judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts
 raashtrapati ke adhyadeshon, apaat kii udghoshnaa or kisi rajya main sanvaidhanik vyavastha ke vifal ho jane kii udghoshnaa or kisi rajya main sanvaidhanik vyavastha ke vifal ho jane kii udghoshnaa ko sansad ke donon sadanon ke samaksh rakhana anivaary he

 Go mantriparishad samuhik rup se lok sabha ke prati uttaradaayi he
 Finally, it is necessary for him to resign as soon as he loses the confidence of the Lok Sabha
 sansadeey shashan kaa arth hona chahie sansad dwaara shashan
 But the Parliament does not govern itself nor can it
 mantriparishad ke bare main ek tarah se kaha ja saktaa he ki yah sansad kii mahaan karypalika samiti hoti he
 Who is entrusted with the responsibility of governing on behalf of the parent body
 sansad kaa kaary vidhaan bananaa, mantranaa dena, aalochana karnaa or logon kii shikayaton ko vyakt karnaa he
 The executive's job is to govern, although she governs on behalf of the Parliament
 bharat jaise bade or baari jansankhya vaale desh main chunaav karana ek bahut bada kaam he
 An independent Election Commission has been set up to ensure that elections to both houses of Parliament - Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha - are unhindered and fair
 lok sabha ke liye saamaanya chunaav jab uski kaaryvadhi samaapt hone vaali ho yaa uske bhang kiye jane par karaae jate hai
 Every citizen of India who is 18 years of age or above is entitled to vote
 loksabhaa kaa chunaav ladane ke liye kam se kam aayu 25 varsh he or rajyasabha ke liye 30 varsh
 Rajya Sabha members represent the people of the states
 inkaa chunaav rajya kii vidhaan sabha ke chune hue sadasyon dwaara hota he
 The President issues a notification on the date suggested by the Election Commission to fill a seat in the Rajya Sabha
 jis tithi ko sevanivrutt hone vaale sadasyon kii padaavadhi samaapt honi ho usase teen maas se adhik samay se purv aisi adhisuchana jari nahin kii jaati
 The Election Officer, with the approval of the Election Commission, determines and notifies the place of voting
 nayi lok sabha ke chunaav ke liye raashtrapati, rajptr main prakashit adhisuchana dwaara, chunaav ayog dwaara sujhai gai tithi ko, sabhi sansadeey nirvachan kshetron se sadsy chunane ke liye kahata he
 After the notification is issued, the Election Commission sets dates for filing nomination papers, scrutinizing them, withdrawing them and voting
 lok sabha ke liye pratyaksh chunaav hone ke kaaran bharat ke rajya kshetra ko upyukt pradeshik nirvachan kshetron main baanta jaataa he
 One member is elected from each parliamentary constituency
 yadi ek sadan kaa koi sadsy duusare sadan ke liye bhi chun liya jaataa he to pehle sadan main uskaa sthaan us tithi se khaali ho jaataa he jab vah anya sadan ke liye chunaa gaya ho
 Similarly, if he is also elected as a member of a State Legislature, if he does not resign from his place in the State Legislature, within 14 days from the publication of the proclamation in the State Gazette, the Parliament The member is no more
 yadi koi sadsy, sadan kii anumati ke bina 60 din kii avadhi tak sadan kii kisi baithak main upasthit nahin hota to vah sadan uske sthaan ko rikt ghoshit kar saktaa he
 Further, a member has to vacate his place in the House if yadi kisi sadsy ko samvidhan kii dasvin anusuchee ke upbandho ke antargat dal-badal ke aadhaar par ayogy siddh kar diya gaya ho, to us sthiti main bhi uski sadsyta samaapt ho sakati he
 An election to a House of Parliament or a State Legislature can be challenged in the High Court

 If proved, the High Court has the power to declare the election of successful candidate void
 prabhavit paksh ko ucch nyaayalay ke aadesh ke viruddh ucchtam nyaayalay main apil karne kaa adhikaar he
 The Lok Sabha is constituted after every general election by notification of Election Commission
 lok sabha kii pehali baithak shapath vidhi ke saath shuru hoti he
 Its newly elected members take an oath 'to have reverence and allegiance to the Constitution of India', 'to keep the sovereignty and integrity of India intact' and 'to devoutly discharge the duties of a Member of Parliament'
 raashtrapati samay samay par sansad ke prayek sadan ko baithak ke liye aamantrit karata he
 After the last date of each session, the President has to invite the Houses for the meeting for the forthcoming session within six months
 yadhyapi sadanon ko baithak ke liye aamantrit karne kii shakti raashtrapati main nihit he tathaapi vyavhaar main is aashay ke prastaav kii pahal sarkaar dwaara kii jaati he
 There are usually three sessions or sessions of Parliament every year
 yatha bajet adhiveshan, monsoon adhiveshan or sheetakaaleen adhiveshan 
 But, in the case of Rajya Sabha, the budget session is divided into two sessions
 in do adhiveshnon ke bich teen se chaar saptaah kaa avkaash hota he
 Thus, there are four sessions in a year of Rajya Sabha
 raashtrapati kaa abhibhaashan The president is elected following the oath of newly elected members
 iske baad, raashtrapati sansad bhawan ke kendriya kaksh main ek saath sansad ke donon sadanon ke samaksh abhibhaashan karata he
 The President's address is a very important occasion
 abhibhaashan main aisi nitiyon evam kaaryakramon kaa vivaran hota he jinhen aagaamee varsh main kaaryrup dene kaa vichaar ho
 Also, a review of his activities and successes of the first year is also given
 vah abhibhaashan chunki sarkaar kii niti kaa vivaran hota he ant: sarkaar dwaara taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 Addressing is discussed very widely
 dhanyavad prastaav ke sanshodhano ke dwaara un maamalon par bhi charchaa ho sakati he jinka abhibhaashan main vishesh rup se ullekh na ho
 The Lok Sabha elects two members of the House as Speaker and Deputy Speaker
 kuch aisi parampara bani he ki upaadhyaksh vipaksh ke sadasyon main se chunaa jaataa he
 It is often the effort of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman in the Rajya Sabha to conduct the proceedings of their House in an orderly manner
 sansadeey kaary do mukhya shirshon main baanta ja saktaa he
 Government work and non-government work
 sarkari kaary ko phir do shreniyon main baanta ja saktaa he, The work of non-official members, that is, Bills and Resolutions, is discussed on every Friday or any day which the Speaker determines for two and a half hours
 sadan main kiye jane vaale vibhinn kaaryon ke liye samay kii sifarish saamanytah kaary mantranaa samiti dwaara kii jaati he
 There is usually a meeting every week
 sansad ke donon sadanon kii kaarywahi kii chhapi hui pratiyaan saamanytah baithak ke baad ek maas ke andar uplabdh kara di jaati hai
 The proceedings are tape-recorded
 vaad vivaad ke adhivationavaar chape hue khand hindi tathaa angreji bhashaa main uplabdh hote hai
 The government is responsible to the Parliament for every mistake it makes and to the people through Parliament
 sadan ke sadsy is adhikaar kaa prayog, anya baton ke saath saath, sansadeey prashnon ke madhyam se karte hai
 Members of Parliament have the right to ask for information from the Ministers of the Government on matters of public importance
 jaankaree praapt karnaa prayek gaiyr-sarkari sadsy kaa sansadeey adhikaar he
 It is necessary for a Member of Parliament as a representative of the people that he is aware of the activities of the Government to carry out his responsibilities
 prashn poochne kaa mul uddeshy lok mahatv ke kisi maamle par jaankaree praapt karnaa or tathy jaananaa he
 In both the Houses, questions are held for an hour at the beginning of each meeting
 or unke uttar die jate hai
 This is called the 'question Hour'
 iske atirikt, khoji or anupoorak prashn poochne se mantriyon kaa bhi pareekshan hota he ki ve apane vibhaagon ke kaarykaran ko kitna samajhate hai
 The Question Hour is the most interesting part of the proceedings of Parliament
 logon ke liye samachar patron ke liye or swayan sadasyon ke liye koi anya kaary itani dilchaspee paidaa nahin karata jitani ki prashnkaal paidaa karata he
 The atmosphere of the house during this period is uncertain
 kabhi achaanak tanaav kaa bavandar uth khadaa hota he to kabhi kahkahe lagane lagate hai
 Occasionally a question arises from a bitter argument
 aisi haalat sadasyon yaa mantriyon kii hajir-javaabi or vinodpriyata se dur ho jaati he
 This is the reason that during the Question Hour not only the House Room but also the audience and press galleries are almost always full
 kuch prashnon kaa maukhik uttar diya jaataa he
 These are called starred questions
 atarankit prashnon kaa likhit uttar diya jaataa he
 It can be said with certainty that members have been showing great interest in exercising their right to ask questions
 chunki prashnon kii prakriya apekshtah saral or aasaan he
 Therefore, it is becoming more and more beloved among Members of Parliament than other measures of parliamentary procedure
 sansad ke donon sadanon main prashnkaal ke thik baad kaa samay aamtaur par ‘shoonyakaal’ athwa jiro aavar ke naam se janaa jane laga he
 It is zero in more than one sense
 12 baje dopaher kaa samay na to madhyahn purv kaa samay hota he or na hi madhyahn pashchaat kaa samay
 'zero Hour' is also known as 'hour' due to its commencement at 12 o'clock because earlier 'zero Hour' used to run for a full hour, that is, until the house was recessed for dinner at 1 o'clock in the day
 yah koi nahin kah saktaa ki is kaal ke dauraan koun-sa maamla uth khadaa ho yaa sarkaar par kis tarah kaa akraman kar diya jaae
 There is no mention of 'zero time' anywhere in the rules
 prashnkaal ke samaapt hote hi sadsygan aise maamle uthaane ke liye khadey ho jate hai jinke bare main ve mahasoos karte hai ki kaarywahi karne main deree nahin kii ja sakati
 However, there is no provision in the rules for raising the case thus
 aisa prathit hota he ki is pratha ke peeche yahi vichaar rahaa he ki aise niyam jo rashtriya mahatv ke maamle yaa logon kii gambhir shikayaton sambandhi maamle sadan main turant uthaae jane main sadasyon ke liye baadhak hote hai, ve nirarthak hai
 In terms of rules, the so-called 'zero time' is an irregularity
 maamle chunki bina anumati ke yaa bina purv soochna ke uthaae jate hai atah isse sadan kaa bahumoolya samay vyarth jaataa he
 This leads to encroachment of legislative, financial and other routine work of the House
 ab to shoonyakaal main uthaaye jane vaale kuch maamalon kii pehle se di gai soochna ke aadhaar par, adhyaksh kii anumati se, ek suchi bhi banane lagi he
 The rules of both the Houses of Parliament provide for raising matters of public importance without delay and in many ways
 jo vibhinn prakriyaayein prayek sadsy ko uplabdh rahati hai ve is prakaar hai: By this, the matter of immediate importance can be discussed by stopping the regular work of the Lok Sabha
 iske dwaara koi bhi sadsy sarkaar kaa dhyaan tatkaal mahatv ke maamle kii or dilaa saktaa he
 The minister has to give a statement in that case
 dhyanakarshan karne vaale prayek sadsy ko ek prashn poochne kaa adhikaar hota he
 They can discuss questions of immediate importance for one hour
 haalaanki is par matdaan nahin hota
 How our elected representatives try to raise matters which have no relation to the interpretation of rules and regulations
 lekin ye maamle us samay unhen or unke nirvachan kshetra ke logon ko uttejit kar rahe hote hai
 The matters which are not questions of the system or which cannot be raised under the rules related to questions, short notice questions, call attention proposals, etc
, are raised under it
 sadan lok mahatv ke vibhinn maamalon par anek faisle karata he or apni raay vyakt karata he
 Any member can put a suggestion before the House in the form of a resolution
 jisamen uski raay yaa ichha di gai ho
 If the House accepts it then it becomes the opinion or wish of the entire House
 ant: mote taur par ‘prastaav’ sadan kaa faisla jaanane ke liye sadan ke saamne laayaa jaataa he
 The proposals are actually the basis of parliamentary proceedings
 lok mahatv kaa koi bhi maamla kisi prastaav kaa vishay ho saktaa he
 Proposals may be offered by different members for different purposes
 prastaav mantriyon dwaara pesh kiye ja sakate hai or gaiyr-sarkari sadasyon dwaara bhi
 The purpose of the proposals presented by non-government members is usually to know the opinion or views of the government on a matter
 sankalp bhi ek prakriyaagat upaay he yah aam logon ke hit ke kisi maamle par sadan main charchaa uthaane ke liye sadasyon or mantriyon ko uplabdh he
 Resolutions can be in the form of a declaration of opinion, or recommendation, similar to resolutions of the general form
 yaa kisi aise anya rup main ho saktaa he jaisaa ki adhyaksh uchit samajhe
 The Council of Ministers remains in office till it has the confidence of the Lok Sabha
 lok sabha dwaara mantriparishad main avishvaas vyakt karte hi sarkaar ko sanvaidhanik rup se pad chhodana hota he
 The rules provide for a motion to this effect called a motion of no confidence
 rajyasabha ko avishvaas prastaav par vichaar karne kii shakti praapt nahin he
 The motion of censure differs from the motion of no-confidence
 avishvaas ke prastaav main un kaarnon kaa ullekh nahin hota jin par vah aadhaarit ho
 But it is necessary to mention such reasons or allegations in the motion of condemnation
 yah prastaav katipay nitiyon or kaaryon ke liye sarkaar kii ninda karne ke iraade se pesh kiya jaataa he
 The censure motion is moved against the Council of Ministers or against any one minister or against some ministers
 usamen kisi mantri yaa mantriyon kii vifaltaa par sadan dwaara khed, rosh yaa aashcharya prakat kiya jaataa he
 Government has to do many tasks of governance, security and public welfare
 in sabake liye bahut saadhan chahie
 Where should he come from? The government collects taxes from the public
 jarurat padane par karje bhi leti he
 Because we live in a parliamentary system, it is necessary for the government to get the approval of Parliament before imposing any tax or incurring any expenditure
 is manjuuri ko lene ke liye hi har varsh sarkaar ek bajet yani puure saal kii aamadani or kharche kaa lekha jokha sansad main pesh karti he
 Rail budget and general budget are presented separately
 saamaanya bajet praayah farvari ke antim kaary diwas par laayaa jaataa he
 The railway budget comes a few days before that
 vittiya varsh is samay prayek saal kii pehali april se aarambh hota he
 It is proposed in the budget that how much money is to be spent on the item during the coming year
 usamen kitna dhan kis tareeke se aayega yaa kahan se jutaya jayega
 Grants are given for the coming year of the budget
 sarkaar ko apni vittiya or aarthik nitiyon tathaa kaaryakramon or unki vyakhya karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 At the same time, Parliament also gets an opportunity to consider and criticize them
 bajet paas karne kii prakriya main sansad ke donon sadanon main gambhir evam purna charchaa hoti he
 This happens a few days after the budget is presented
 charchaa saamaanya vaad vivaad se aarambh hoti he
 It lasts for three or four days in both houses of Parliament
 pratha yah he ki is avasthaa main sadsy sarkaar kii rajkoshiya or aarthik nitiyon ke saamaanya pahaluon par hi vichaar karte hai
 Do not go into tax and expenditure details
 is prakaar saamaanya vaad vivaad se prayek sadan ko apane vichaar vyakt karne kaa avasar miltaa he
 The government also realizes what will be the reaction to a particular proposal in later stages
 yah dhyaan dene kii baat he ki rajyasabha ko saamaanya charchaa ke alaava bajet se koi sarokaar nahin hota
 Voting on demands takes place only in the Lok Sabha
 duusari avasthaa anudaanon kii maangon par charchaa or matdaan kii he
 Normally, separate demands are placed for the proposed grants for each ministry
 in ‘maango’ kaa sambandh bajet ke vyay vaale bhaag se hota he
 Their form is that of the request made by the Executive to the Lok Sabha to be given the right to spend the amount demanded
 maango par charchaa ruchipurna hoti he
 During the discussions, the policies and activities of the Ministry are closely scrutinized
 anudaanon kii maangon ke mul prastaav ke sahaayak prastaav pesh karke sadsy aisa kar sakate hai
 These subsidiary proposals are called 'cut motions' in parliamentary language
 bajet paas karne kii prakriya bajet pesh kiye jane se is par charchaa karne or anudaanon kii maange sweekrut karne or viniyog tathaa vitt vidheyakon ke paas hone tak saamanytah chaalu vittiya varsh ke aarambh hone ke baad tak chalati rahati he
 Till Parliament approves the demands, it is necessary that the government has sufficient funds available to run the administration of the country
 isliye ‘lekhanudaan’ ke liye vishesh upbandh kiya gaya he
 By which the Lok Sabha has been given the power to grant advance grants for a part of a financial year till the completion of the budget process
 kanoon bananaa sansad kaa pramukh kaam mana jaataa he
 The initiative for this is mostly done by the executive
 sarkaar vidhaayi prastaav pesh karti he
 After discussion and debate on it, Parliament imposes its seal of approval on it
 sabhi kanoonee prastaav vidheyak ke rup main sansad main pesh kiye jate hai
 a bill is a draft legislative proposal
 vidheyak sansad ke kisi ek sadan main sarkaar dwaara yaa kisi gaiyr-sarkari sadsy dwaara pesh kiya ja saktaa he
 Thus broadly, there are two types of Bills: Government Bills and Private Members' Bills
 vidhi kaa rup lene vaale adhikansh vidheyak sarkari vidheyak hote hai
 By the way, very few bills of non-government members take the form of law
 phir bhi unke dwaara yah baat sarkaar or logon ke dhyaan main laai jaati he ki maujuuda kanoon main sanshodhan karne yaa koi aavashyak vidhaan banane kii aavashyaktaa he
 The draft of the Bill is prepared with the help of the Ministry of Law in the Ministry of Government related to that subject
 mantrimandal ke anumodan ke baad ise sansad ke saamne laayaa jaataa he
 It can be introduced in either of the two houses of Parliament by the Minister concerned
 keval dhan vidheyak ke maamle main yah pabandi he ki vah rajyasabha main pesh nahin kiya ja saktaa
 The Bill has to go through various stages in Parliament before it takes the form of an Act
 prayek vidheyak ke prayek sadan main teen vachan hote hai
 That is, first reading, second reading and third reading
 vidheyak ‘pesh karnaa,’ vidheyak kaa pehla vaachan he
 According to custom, this stage is not discussed
 vidheyak kaa doosraa vaachan sabase adhik vistrut evam mahatvapurn avasthaa he kyonki isi avasthaa main isaki vistrut evam baariki se jaanch kii jaati he
 When the House considers and approves all sections of the Bill and the schedules, if any
 tab mantri yah prastaav kar saktaa he ki vidheyak ko paas kiya jaae
 This is called the third reading
 jis sadan main vidheyak pesh kiya gaya ho usamen paas kiye jane ke baad use sahmati ke liye duusare sadan main bheja jaataa he
 There the bill then passes through all three stages
 kisi vidheyak par donon ke bich asahmati ke kaaran gatirodh hone par ek asaadhaaran sthiti utpann ho jaati he
 Which is resolved in the joint sitting of the two houses
 jab donon sadanon dwaara koi vidheyak alag alag yaa sanyukt baithak main paas kar diya jaataa he to use raashtrapati ke paas bheja jaataa he
 If the President grants permission, the Bill becomes an Act from the date of the assent
 sanshodhan ke dwaara samvidhan ke kisi bhi anuchhed main badlaav laayaa ja saktaa he
 But according to the decision of the Supreme Court, no change which can destroy or reduce the basic structure or fundamental elements of the Constitution can be made
 sansadeey visheshadhikaar ve vishisht adhikaar hai jo sansad ke donon sadanon ko, uske sadasyon ko or samitiyon ko praapt he
 Privileges are given with the view that both the Houses of Parliament, its committees and members can function independently
 unki garima bani rahe, parantu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki kanoon kii najaron main saadhaaran nagarikon ke mukaable main visheshadhikaar praapt sadasyon kii sthiti bhinn he
