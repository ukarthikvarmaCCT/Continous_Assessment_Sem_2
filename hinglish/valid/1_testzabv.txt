 terry shiyaavo kii maut – yuthenesia par duniyabha main charchaa The issue of American woman Terry Schiavo sparked the issue
 41 saal kii terry shiyaavo pichley saal chal bases
 The Florida woman had a heart attack in 1990

 Some cases related to euthanasia demand in India •terry shiyaavo ke maamle par bahes kii pratidhwani bharat main sunai dene lagi he
 Here also some cases have come up where the patient's relatives or the patient himself expressed his wish for death

 What does Indian law say bharat main ichha-mrityu or dayaa mrityu donon hi avaidhanik krity hai kyonki mrityu kaa prayaas, jo ichha ke karyavyan ke baad hi hoga, vah bhartiya dand vidhaan kii dhara 309 ke antargat aatmahatya kaa aparaadh he
 Similarly, mercy death, which may be motivated by human emotion and is to be done to alleviate the unbearable suffering of the victim, is also considered a crime of culpable homicide under Section 304 of Indian Penal Code
 •jeene kaa adhikaar he to marane kaa kyon nahin? The constitutionality of Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code in the case of P
 Rathinam v
 Union of India was objected on the ground that this section is an infringement of Article 21 of the Constitution
 yani jeene kaa adhikaar he to marane kaa bhi adhikaar hona chahie
 But in 1996, the Supreme Court overturned the said decision in Gyanakore v
 State of Punjab and clarified that the right to life does not include the right to life under Article 21
 atah dhara 306 or 309 sanvaidhanik or maanya hai

 The Law Commission of India, in its report submitted to the Parliament last year, recommended legalizing the death of mercy
 haalanki ayog ne yah mana he ki is par lambii bahes kii gunzaaish abhi baaqi he or nikat bhavishya main ise manzuri dene kii koi sambhaavna nazar nahin aati
 • 1995 Euthanasia Bill approved in the northern state of Australia

 • In April 2002, Euthanasia was granted a legal status in the Netherlands in a special condition
 •sitambar 2002 main belgium ne ise manyata di
 • Since 1937, suicide with medical aid in Switzerland has been acceptable
 bharat main ichha-mrityu, samadhi or santhara In order to understand the distinction between euthanasia, suicide and Santhara, we must first classify and understand the distinction of death

 andrew mcdonald Pratyahara has a different meaning in the context of Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga
 yahan pratyaahaar ko panineey vyakaran ke sandarbh main diya gaya he
 Pratyahara means 'short statement'
 vyakaran main pratyaahaar vibhinn varna-samooh ko abhipsit rup se sankshep main grahan karne kii ek paddati he
 For example, the entire vowel characters from 'a' to 'a' and 'a' from a, a, i, u, r, lr, o and au, etc
 ashtaadhi ke pratham adhyay ke pratham paad ke 71wein sutara ‘adirantyen saheta’ sutara dwaara pratyaahaar banane kii vidhi kaa panini ne nirdesh kiya he
 Adirantyen Saheta: The Adi Varna creates a pratyahar with the last Varna Varna, which gives a comprehensive understanding of the Adi Varna and the pre-conscious Varna Varna
 udhaaharan: ach = pratham pratyaahaar sutara ‘aiun’ ke aadi varna ‘a’ ko chaturth sutara ‘aiuch’ ke antim varna ‘ch’ se yoga karaane par ach pratyaahaar banataa he
 This good pratyahar makes sense of all the letters from its initial letter 'A' to the one who comes before it
 atah, ach = a i u ri e i o ou
 In the same way, the attainment of light pratyahar is achieved by mixing the initial letter 'ha' of the 5th sutra hayavart with the last letter of the 14th sutra haal
 faltah, In all the 14 sutras mentioned above, the last letter is mentioned by Panini
 it - in dhaatu se gamnaarth me nishpann pad he
 The task of the cognate characters is to make a contract and come out at the end
 atah, it sangya hone se in antim varnon kaa upyog pratyaahaar banane ke liye keval anubandh hetu kiya jaataa he, lekin vyakaraniya prakriya me inaki gananaa nahi kii jaati he arthath inkaa prayog nahi hota he
 Panini has been instructed by which characters have the same noun: 1
 upadeshejanunasik it : upadesh me anunasik ach it hote hai
 , Dhanatapatha, Ganapatha, Unadipatha, Suffix, Agam, Order etc
 Dhanatasutraganonadi Sankalinganushasanam
 adesho aagmashch upadeshaa prakirtita 
) anunasik – mukhanasikavachanonunasika
 That is, the letters which should be pronounced with the help of both mouth and nasal
 ashtaadhi me panini ne jin varnon kii anunasikta kaa nirdesh kiya he vahi anunasik maane jaate hai
 )2
 Halantyam: In the sermon, the last hal = consonant letter is there
 lekin vibhakti me antim takaar, sakaar tathaa makaar kaa lop nahi hota he – na vibhaktu tusmah Other formulas governing the noun are: 3
adirnitudavah 4
sh
 Pratyasya 5
 Lashkavadhitthe 6
 Chutu it sangya hone se in varnon kaa lop – tasya lopah sutara se hota he
 Lope means - invisibility - invisibility lopah
 faltah, it sangya vaale varna vidyaman rahete hue bhi dikhaai nahi padate
 Hence, they are not even counted
 panini ko jab bhi akshar-samooh vishesh kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, ve sabhi aksharon ko pruthak – pruthak kehane kii bajaae upyukt pratyaahaar kaa prayog karte hai jisame un aksharon kaa samavesh hota he
 Example: Panini defines a specific noun 'property': aden gunah arthath aden ko gun kehete hai
 Here, add = AT + AN
 is udhaaharan me ein ek pratyaahaar he
 Maheshwar Sutra - This pratyahar is formed due to the contraction of the initials 'A' and the last letter
 ein = e o ein ke antim akshar kii it sangya hoti he 
 It is lost by being a noun
 faltah, ein = e, o
 Hence, A, a and o are called properties
 udhaaharan: iko yanchi : yadi ach pare ho to ik ke sthaan par yan hota he
 Ach = A, I, U, ॠ, ॡ, A, O, AI, Au
 ik = i, u, ri, 
 y = y, v, r, l
 yadi panini uparyukt pratyaaharon kaa prayog nahi karte to unhe kahana padataa: yadi, i, u, ri, ke baad a, i, u, ri, , e, o, i, ou rahen to i, u, ri tathaa ke sthaan par kramshah ya, va, r, l, hota he
 Panini has expressed this statement in very brief form with only two words 'eco Yanchi'

 Greek architecture had refined perfection, Roman buildings are renowned for their scientific construction, French Gothi architecture signifies fiery activity, Italian revival reflects the erudition of that era and the major feature of Indian architecture is its spiritual theme

 ringtone athwa ring tone kisi telephone par aane vaali kol athwa shabdic sandesh kaa sanket dene vaali dhwani ko kaha jaataa he
 Although it is not literally a tone, nowadays the term is most commonly used on mobile phones for sounds that can be chosen by interest
 apane network dwaara aane vaali kol ko ingit kiye jane par phone aawaaj "ring" karata he tathaa apane prayogkarta ko isaki soochna detaa he
 The call signal for a landline telephone can be the current generated by a switch or exchange to which it is connected
 For mobile phones, the network sends an incoming call signal to the phone
 telephone "ring" kisi aane vaali telephone kol ko darshane ke liye kii jane vaali dhwani hoti he
 The origin of the term is attributed to the fact that early telephones had bells and electromagnetic clappers that produced ring sound
 purvollekhith vidyut sanket vidyut-chumbakon ko shakti dete the jo teevr gati se claparon ko khinchate tathaa chhodte the jinase ghantiyaan bajati thim

 koi ringing sanket ek vidyut telephone sambandhi sanket hota he jo telephone dwaara prayogkarta ko aane vaali kol kii soochna detaa he
 To do this in the POTS telephone system, a ringing current is sent, which is a current DC current of about 100 volts
 compymaan disi main kramik polarity nahin hoti he; yah shunya se adhiktam voltage tathaa waapas shunya tak compymaan hota he
 Nowadays this signal can be sent digitally for the majority of its journey, only to be converted to a ringing current at the end as most landline phones are not completely digital
 puraane phonon main yah voltage phone kii ghanti bajaane ke liye ucch-impidence vaale vidyut-chumbakon ke liye trigar kaa kaary karata tha
 Fixed phones of the late 20th century and beyond detect this ringing current voltage and turn on the warbling tone with the help of electronics
 mobile phone puri tarah se digital hote hai, isliye ring karne ke liye ve cell base steshnon ke saath samvaad ke upyog main laayi jane vaali protocol se sanket praapt karte hai

 yah sanket he ki telephone kol kaa jawaab diya gaya he or telephone exange tatkaal line se ring sanket hataa kar kol jod detaa he

 In Australia and the UK, the ring frequency is 400 ms on, 200 ms off, 400 ms on, 200 ms off

 He said that if the proclamation of independence is good in all villages and all cities, even
 agar sabhi jagahon par ek hi samay main sangoshtiyaan hon to acha hoga
 Gandhiji suggested that the time of the seminar be announced by beating the drum with a traditional arrow
 rashtriya dhvaj ko fahraae jane se samarohon kii shuruyaat hogi
 The rest of the day will be spent in any creative work, whether it is spinning yarn or serving the 'untouchables' or reuniting Hindus and Muslims or prohibited work or doing all these together and it is not impossible

 Immediately after celebrating 'independence Day', Mahatma Gandhi announced that he would lead a visit to break one of the most despicable laws of British India, which gave the state a monopoly on the production and sale of salt
 namak ekadhikaar ke jis mudde kaa unhone chayan kiya tha vah gandhi ji kii kushal samajhadaari kaa ek anya udhaahrantha
 The use of salt was unavoidable in every Indian household, but in spite of this they were also prevented from making salt for domestic use and thus they were forced to buy salt from shops at a high price
 namak par rajya kaa ekadhpitya bahut alokapriy tha
 Targeting this, Gandhiji was thinking of organizing widespread dissatisfaction against the British rule
 adhikansh bharatiyon ko gandhi ji kii is chunauti kaa mahatv samaj main aa gaya tha kintu angreji raaj ko nahin
 Although Gandhi ji had informed the Viceroy Lord Irwin about his 'salt March', but Irwin could not understand the importance of his action
 12 march 1930 ko gandhi ji ne sabarmati main apane ashram se samudr kii ore chalanaa shuru kiya
 Three weeks later he reached his destination

 Meanwhile, parallel salt trips were organized in other parts of the country

 Like 1920-22, Gandhiji's call this time also inspired all Indian sections to express their dissatisfaction against colonial rule
 jawaab main sarkaar asantushton ko hiraasat main lene lagi
 About 60,000 people were arrested in connection with the Salt Satyagraha

 In a village called Vasna, Gandhiji had addressed the upper caste and said that if you raise your voice in favor of Swaraj, then you have to serve the untouchables
 sirf namak kar yaa anya karon ke khatm ho jane se aapako swaraj nahin mil jayega
 For Swaraj you have to atone your mistakes that you have done to the untouchables
 swaraj ke liye hindu, musalmaan, parsi or sikh, sabko ekajute hona padega
 These are the steps to self governance

 In his report sent to the government, the District Superintendent of Police; Superintendent of Police wrote that Fisri Gandhi appeared calm and relaxed
 ve jaise-jaise aage bad rahe hai, unki takat badhati ja rahi he
 The progress of the Salt March can also be understood from one more point
 america samachar patrika time ko gandhi ji kii kadalathi par hansee aati thi
 The magazine made fun of his pillow-like body and spider-like legs
 is yatra ke bare main apni pehali report main hi time ne namak yatra ke manzil tak pahunchne par apni gahari shankaa vyakt kar di thi
 He claimed that Gandhiji had fallen on the ground after walking on the second day
 patrika ko is baat par vishwaas nahin tha ki is marial sadhu ke sharir main or aage jane kii takat bachi he
 But in one night, the thinking of the magazine changed
 time ne likhaa ki is yatra ko jo baari jansamarthan mil rahaa he usne angrej shaskaon ko baichaiyn kar diya he
 Now they too have started saluting Gandhi ji by calling him a monk and public leader who is using Christian methods as a weapon against the Christian religious people
 namak yatra kam se kam teen kaarnon se ullekhneey thi
 First, it was this incident that caused Mahatma Gandhi to come into the eyes of the world
 is yatra ko europe or america press ne vyapak kawarej di
 Secondly, this was the first nationalist activity in which women also participated actively
 samaajawaadee kaaryakarta kamaladevi chatopadhyaay ne gandhi ji ko samajhaayaa ki ve apane andolanon ko purushon tak hi simit na rakhen
 Kamaladevi herself was one of the numerous women who gave mass arrests in violation of salt or liquor laws
 teesraa or sambhavat: sabase mahatvapurn kaaran yah tha ki namak yatra ke kaaran hi angrejon ko yah ahsaas hua tha ki ab unka raaj bahut din nahin tik sakegaa or unhen bharatiyon ko bhi satta main hissaa dena padegaa

 According to the theory, if several different thermal pairs of the furnace and condenser are assembled and a Carno engine is fitted between each, then the work done by it is proportional to the temperature difference of these pairs
 is prakaar kaary ke maapan se tapantar gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 The efficiency of this engine does not depend on the amount of liquid in its cylinder and its state, hence it is considered as the basis of temperature and the temperature determined by it is called paramatap
 centegrade or fahrenheit paimaane kii tarah paramtaap mapkram kaa shunya manamaana nahin hota
 The work done by the Carno engine depends on the temperature of both the furnace and the condenser
 sanghnitr kii tapiya avasthaa aisi bhi ho sakati he ki yah ingine bhatthi se praapt samast ooshmaa ko kaary main badal de or sanghnitr ko uskaa koi bhi ansh praapt na ho
 In such a situation, the temperature of the condenser is considered zero
 degree kaa pariman nirdhaaran karne ke liye pehle kii tarah do niyat binduon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Before 1954, snow and steam points were also used in the paramatap scale
 in donon ke tapabhed ko 100° param mana jaataa tha
 This means that the centenary work of the work obtained by placing the Carne engine furnace on the steampoint and the condenser on the icepoint exhibits a degree of work
 is prabandh main badi kathinaayee yah padati he ki himbindu kii yatharthata simit he or bhinn vaigyanikon dwaara praapt raashimaanon main ± 01° paa tak kaa antar paaya jaataa he
 To avoid this, only one fixed point has been used since 1954 as per international determination
 trikbindu us taap ko kehete hai jisapar pani, barf or jalawaashp kaa samya sambhav he
 Its value has been voluntarily assumed to be 273
16 ° Pa
 aisa kaha ja saktaa he ki san 1954 se purv paramtaap paimaana teen binduon, dwaara nirghaarit hota tha, kintu ab keval do binduon kaa upyog hota he
 In other words, one of the two fixed points mentioned at the beginning of this article is Paramashuni and the other is Trikbindu
 trikbindu or paramashunya ke bich kaary karanevaale carno ingine dwaara jo kaary hota he uskaa 1 / 273
16 ansh kaary ek param degree kaa bodh karata he
 The engine of Carno is ideal and in practice its construction is not possible, but it can be proved that the thermometer's readings produced by the thermal diffusion of the ideal gas are equal to the permittivity
 at: adarsh gas paimaana swat: pramaan, athwa praathmik maanak, mana jaataa he
 An ideal gas is a gas that follows the following law: jisamen daab, aaytan tathaa paramataap hote he
 Is a constant whose value is the same for a gram-molecule quantity of each ideal gas
 gas tharmametre do prakaar ke hote hai, ek to sthir aaytan vaale or duusare sthir daab vaale
 The earlier action is simple and its errors can be corrected reliably
 at: sthir aaytan tapamapiyon kaa hi upyog hota he
 As the name suggests, pressure is measured by keeping the volume of the gas constant
 adarsh gas tapamapi se taap nikaalane main athak parishram or samay kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is possible to have errors in the text due to many reasons and the result obtained for them has to be amended
 kuch trutiyaan to tapamapi kii banaavat main uchit parivartan karke dur kii jaati hai or kuch ke liye lambii gananaa kerani hoti he
 From this it is proved that gas thermometer may not be suitable for daily work in the laboratory
 isaliye antarrashtriya nishchay ke anusaar kuch padaarthon ke galnaank or kvathanank praathmik maanak ke rup main prayukt hote hen
 These scores have been properly measured after much diligence from the ideal gas scale and their values have gained international acceptance

 Many metal wires are used for this work
 phir bhi platinum taar ke bane tapamapi kaa mahatv isaliye adhik hota he kyonki vah antarrashtriya paimaane ke antarveshan ke liye prayukt hota he
 The wire must be pure metal and deformation free

 Several types of electrodes are used for resistivity
 inamen calendar-griffith kaa sethu purana or sarvavidit he
 It is based on the principle of Wheatstone Bridge
 pratiroshmapan ke platinum taar ko jin vaahak taron se sanyukt kiya jaataa he ve bhi ooshmaa se garm ho jate hai, jisase unke pratirodh main bhi parivartan ho jaataa he
 This change is also measured by the bridge and becomes the cause of inaccuracy in the calculation of heat
 calendar griffith sethu se is truti ko dur karne ke liye thik isi prakaar ke vaahak taar sethu kii sanyugmi bhujaa main bhi daal die jate hai
 Both pairs live close by in the thermometer and have a similar heat effect
 is kaaran sethu ke santulan or maapit pratirodh par inkaa koi asar nahin hota
 Another way to correct this error is to measure the difference between the ends of the platinum wire by not removing its resistance
 taar ke andar nishchit maatra main vidyudhara kaa pravaah kiya jaataa he
 Differential measurements are taken by connecting its two ends with a potentiometer
 pratirodh ke samaanupati hone ke kaaran vibhavantar se om ke niyamanusaar pratirodh kii gananaa kar lee jaati he
 In these, the effect of resistance of the carrier wires is completely lost

 Therefore, it can be measured by measuring temperature
 aise taar ke jodon ko tapantar yugma kehete hai
 The metals of the heating pairs used in the international scale are described above, but various metals are used in the laboratory keeping in mind the requirements of sensitivity and use

 When a solid object is heated, it radiates energy in the form of electromagnetic waves
 kam tapavriddhi hone par tarangon kaa tarangadairghy kam hota he or unase ooshmaa kaa anubhav hota hai
 At higher temperatures, there is an excess of waves with shorter wavelengths, which reflect light
 vikeern urja kii maatra or uske gun garm vastu kii avasthaa par bhi nirbhar karte hai
 a completely black object has the property that it exploits all the radiated energy on it and automatically radiates maximum energy
 aisi vastu ko krishna vastu athwa krishnaka bhi kehete hai
 If the walls of a closed hollow body are placed on the stratosphere, then the radiated energy produced within it is completely similar in properties and quantity to black body radiation

 tapamaapan ke liye ucchatapiya vastu kaa vikiran kisi lens athwa darpan se tapantar yugma ke ek sire par focus kar dete he usase urja oogyaat ho jaati he
 If the constants are known, heat can be calculated by the above equation
 vastav main anek trutiyon ke kaaran taap kaa ghaat 4 se thodaa bhinn hota he
 So in practice let's use the equation given below: isamen or sthiraank hai
 b must be 4 according to Stephen's rule, but here it is considered unknown
 ucchatapiya krishnika kaa taap or tapantar yugma ko taap he
 a and b is assumed by placing the thermometer in front of black bodies of certain temperatures
 yantra main vikiran ke focusikaran kaa aisa prabandh rahata he ki usase maapit taap ucchatapiya vastu kii duuri par nirbhar nahin karata
 If the object is not completely Krishna then amendment is done for this inaccuracy

 a synchronous motor or synchronous motor is an alternating current-driven electric motor
 iskaa naam tulyakalika motor yaa sincronas motor is kaaran he kyonki iske roter kii ghurnan gati thik-thik utani hi hoti he jitani stater main nirmit ghurni chumbakeey kshetra kii gati hoti he
 This motor is often not used to rotate a load, but is used to improve the power coefficient
 vishesh sthitiyon main iskaa upyog lod chalaane main bhi kiya jaataa he
 Synchronous speed, jahaan: The main parts of a synchronous motor are the stator and rotor
 isaki stater bhi preran motor ke samaan hi hoti he jis par teen-feji vinding kii gayi hoti he
 The magnetic field is generated either by a permanent magnet on the rotor or by giving DC to the electromagnets built on the rotor
 baahar se is disi ko roter par laane ke liye slip ring kaa prayog karnaa padataa he
 In large motors, a DC generator is placed on the same shaft
 isse praapt disi ko roter par bane vidyutchumbakon ko diya jaataa he
 Depending on the design, the rotor is of two types - tulykaalik motor ko 'over-iksite' karke chalaane par iske dwaara lee gayi dhara iske voltage se agragami hoti he
 On this basis, it can be used to increase the power coefficient
 isaki sabase acchhee baat yah he ki yadi lod kaa shakti-gunank parivartit ho rahaa ho to is motor kii field-viding kii dhara ko parivartit karke iske dwaara lee jane vaali dhara kaa shakti-gunank bhi is prakaar parivartit kiya ja saktaa he ki lod tathaa yah tulykaalik motor kaa sammilit shakti-gunank 1 ho jaay
 The V-curve of the synchronous motor is shown in the front diagram
 isse spasht hota he ki roter kaa field iksitesan badalane par iske stater se lee gayi dhara kaa phej badalata he

 vaidic sabhyataa pracheen bharat kii sabhyataa he jisamen vedon kii rachana hui
 Indian scholars consider this civilization to be of eternal tradition
 According to Western scholars, a community of Aryans arrived in India around 1500 BCE and this civilization started with their arrival
 aam taur par adhiktar vidwaan vaidic sabhyataa kaa kaal 1500 isvi isa purv se 500 isvi isa purv ke bich me maanate he, parantu nae puraatatva utkhanno se mili avasheshon me vaidic sabhyataa ke kai avshesh mili hai jisase aadhunik vidwaan jaise david frale, telgiri, bi bi laal, es r raav, subhash kaak, aravindo yah maanane lage he ki vaidic sabhyataa bharat me hi shuru hui thi or rugveda kaa rachana shunga kaal main huyi, Because there is no evidence from Archaeological excavations of Aryans coming to India nor any evidence from DNA Anusandhano, the foundation of the present Hinduism was laid in this period which still exists today
 vedon ke atirikt sanskrit ke anya kai grantho kii rachana bhi isi kaal main hui thi
 The Vedangasutraon is composed in arranging these Vedic texts of the mantra Brahmana and Upanishads
 Later Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranoki were composed, which are considered as the source of knowledge of this period

 is kaal main uttari bharat kai mahajanapadon main banta tha
 The Vedic civilization got its name because the Vedas are the major source of information of that period
 veda chaar he - rugveda, samaveda, atharvaveda or yajurveda
 Of these, the Rigveda was the first to be composed
 rugveda main hi gayatri mantra he jo savita ko samarpit he
 Scholars are not unanimous in determining the time of the Rigveda
 sabase pehle maiks mular ne vedon ke kaal nirdhaaran kaa prayaas kiya
 He arbitrarily gave 200–200 years of creation of three texts of Vedic literature, going backwards from Buddhism, and thus considered the Rigveda's creation period to be around 1200 BCE, but certainly no assessment of his assessment Was not the basis
 vaidic kaal ko mukhyatah do bhaagon main baanta ja saktaa he- rigvaidic kaal or uttar vaidic kaal
 The Rig Vedic period was the period immediately after the arrival of the Aryans, in which rituals were secondary, but ritualism gained prominence in Hinduism in the later Vedic period

 a major reason for this is also that till this time only this book was composed

 Max Müller then acknowledged that "there is no power on earth that can tell for sure that Vedic mantras were composed in 1000 BCE or 1500 BCE or 2000 or 3000"
 aisa mana jaataa he ki aaryon kaa ek samooh bharat ke atirikt iran or europe kii taraf bhi gaya tha
 The earliest texts in the Iranian language, Avesta, resemble the Rigveda
 agar is bhashik samarupata ko dekhen to rugveda kaa rachanakaal 1000 isapurv aata he
 But looking at the Hindu deities Inda, Mitravarun, Nasatya etc
 in the 1400 BCE inscription found in Bogaj-koi, it can be considered back and forth
 bal gangadhar tilak ne jyotishiya gananaa karke iskaa kaal 6000 i
