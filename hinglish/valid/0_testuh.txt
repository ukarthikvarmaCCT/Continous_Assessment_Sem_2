 It is one of the few sun temples of India
 san 1984 main unesco ne ise vishwa dharohar sthal ke rup main manyata di he
 This temple was dedicated to Surya-deva, meaning extracts, which the locals called biranchi-narayan
 isi kaaran is kshetra ko use arq-kshetra yaa padam-kshetra kaha jaataa tha
 According to the Puranas, Lord Krishna's son Samb had developed leprosy due to his curse
 samb ne mithravan main chandrabhaga nadi ke sagar sangam par konark main, baarah varshon tak tapasya kii or surya dev ko prasann kiya tha
 Suryadev, who was the destroyer of all diseases, had also prevented its disease
 tadnusaar samb ne surya bhagwaan kaa ek mandir nirmaan kaa nishchay kiya
 Taking a bath in the Chandrabhaga river, after his destruction, he found a statue of Suryadev
 yah murti suryadev ke sharir ke hi bhaag se, devshilpi shri vishwakarma ne banaayi thi
 Samb installed this idol in a temple in his built Mitravan, since then this place came to be considered sacred
 yah kai itihaaskaaron kaa mat he, ki konark mandir ke nirmaankarta, raja langool nrisinghdev kii akaal mrityu ke kaaran, mandir kaa nirmaan kaary khatai main pad gaya
 As a result, the unfinished structure collapsed
 lekin is mat ko aitihaasik aankadon kaa samarthan nahin miltaa he
 According to the figures of the Madal Register of Puri and some 1278 AD copper sheets, it was revealed that King Langul Narsinghdeva ruled till 1282
 kai itihaaskaar, is mat ke bhi hai, ki konark mandir kaa nirmaan 1253 se 1260 i
 ke bich hua tha
 Therefore, the incomplete construction of the temple is not logical to be the reason for its collapse
 yahan par mandir kii dhwastata ke sampoorn kaarnon kaa ullekh karnaa jatil kaary se kam nahin he
 But it is well known that much of it has now been destroyed
 jiske mukhya kaaran vaastu dosha bhi kaha jaataa he parantu muslim akramanon kii bhoomika ahm rahi he
 It is said that this temple was eroded in just 800 years due to its architectural defects
 jise vaastu kala va niyamon ke viruddh kaha-suna jaataa he
 For this reason, even before its time period, it collapsed despite being a unique example of Rigveda and Stone Art
 is surya-mandir ke mukhya vaastu dosha hai:-
 According to many legends, a magnetic stone is placed on the summit of the Sun Temple
 iske prabhaav se, konark ke samudr se guzarane vaale sagarpot, is ore khinche chale aate hai, jisase unhen baari kshati ho jaati he
 According to another legend, due to this stone, the magnetic direction representation devices of ships do not tell the right direction
 is kaaran apane poton ko bachaane hetu, muslim navik is pathar ko nikaal le gayi
 This stone was acting as a central stone, so that all the stones in the temple walls were in balance
 iske hatane ke kaaran, mandir kii deevaaron kaa santulan kho gaya or parinamtah ve gir padin
 But there is no historical description of this incident, nor is there any description of the existence of any such magnetic central stone
 konark mandir ke girane se sambandhi ek ati mahatvapurn siddhant, kalapahad se judaa he
 According to the history of Orissa, Kalapahad invaded here in 1508 and destroyed many Hindu temples of Orissa including Konark temple
 puri ke jagannatha mandir ke madan panji bataate hai, ki kaise kalapahaad ne urisa par hamalaa kiya
 He also demolished the statues of most Hindu temples, including the Konark temple
 haalanki konark mandir kii 20-25 feet moti deevaaron ko todna asambhav tha, usne kisi prakaar se dadhinauti ko hilaane kaa prayojan kar liya, jo ki is mandir ke girane kaa kaaran bana
 Due to the removal of Dadhinauti, the temple started to fall slowly and due to heavy stone falling from the roof, the roof of the silent hall also collapsed
 usne yahan kii adhikansh murtiyon or konark ke anya kai mandir bhi dhwast kar diye
 In 1568, the terror of Muslims in Orissa was under control
 parantu iske baad bhi hindu mandiron ko todane ke nirantar prayaas hote rahe
 At this time, the pandas of Jagannath temple of Puri removed the idol of Lord Jagannath from the shrine and hid it in a secret place
 isi prakaar, konark ke surya mandir ke pandon ne pradhan devtaa kii murti ko hataa kar, varshon tak ret main dabaa kar chipaaye rakhaa
 Later, this idol was sent to Puri and placed there in the temple of Indra, located in the courtyard of the Jagannath temple
 anya logon ke anusaar, yahaan kii puja murtiyon abhi bhi khoji jaani baaki hai
 But many people say that the idol of Surya Dev, which is kept in the National Museum of New Delhi, is the main worship idol of Konark
 phir bhi konark main, surya vandana mandir se murti ke hatane ke baad se band ho gayi
 Due to this, pilgrims stopped coming to Konark
 konark kaa pattan bhi daakuon ke hamale ke kaaran, band ho gaya
 Konark was a famous city for commercial activities similar to Surya Vandana, but due to the closure of these activities, it became completely uninhabited and was covered with a deep forest for years
 san 1626 main, khurda ke raja, nrisingh dev, suputr shri purushottam dev, suryadev kii murti ko do anya surya or chandra kii murtiyon sahit puri le gayi
 Now they meet in the courtyard of the temple of Puri
 puri ke madal panji ke itihaas se gyaat hota he, ki san 1028 main, raja nasinghdev ne konark ke sabhi mandiron ke naap-jokh kaa aadesh diya tha
 At the time of the measurement, the Sun Temple existed up to its Amalka sila, i

 The Treaty of Versailles took place at the end of the First World War between Germany and the coalition countries
 pratham vishwayuddh ke baad parajeet germany ne 28 june 1919 ke din varsay kii sandhi par hastakshar kiye
 This led to Germany losing a large part of its land, banning the occupation of other states, limiting the size of their army and imposing heavy compensation
 varsay kii sandhi ko germany par jabardastee thopa gaya tha
 For this reason Adolf Hitler and other Germans considered it disgraceful and thus the treaty was one of the causes of World War II
 paris shanti sammelan main anekanek sandhiyon evam samjhauton kaa masavida taiyaar kiya gaya or un par hastakshar kiye gayi, lekin in sabhi sandhiyon main germany ke saath jo varsay kii sandhi hui vah anek drushtiyon se mahatvapurn he or sabhi sandhi main pramukh he
 After four months of hard work, the contract of the treaty was ready
 230 prishthon main ankit yah sandhi 15 bhaagon main vibhakt thi or usamen 440 dharaayen thim
 On 6 May 1919, it appeared before the conference and was approved

 The delegates were held at the Tryon Palace Hotel

 He was given only two weeks to discuss this issue
 germany ko kisi bhi tarah sandhi par hastakshar karnaa hi tha
 German politicians seriously considered the treaty issue and after 26 days submitted an opposing proposal of sixty thousand words on their behalf
 germany ne is baat kii shikaayat kii thi ki usne jin sharton par aatmasamarpan kiya tha, prastaavit sandhi main un siddhanton kaa ulanghan hua he
 He said that the new government of Germany is completely democratic and is interested in membership of the League of Nations
 nirastrikaran kii shart keval germany par hi nahin, apitu samast rajyon par lagu kii jaani chahie
 It is wrong to hold sole Germany responsible for the World War
 german prastaav main yah bhi kaha gaya tha ki sandhi kii sabhi sharton ko maananaa asambhav he
 Permanent peace cannot be established by crushing and enslaving a large nation
 mitrarashtron ne germany ke prastaavon par vichaar kiya or kuch chote-mote parivartan ke baad germany ko paanch dinon ke bheetar hi sanshodhit sandhi par hastakshar karne ko kaha gaya
 This time Germany was not given the opportunity to submit any amendment or request regarding the terms of the treaty
 mitrarashtron ne spasht kar diya tha ki hastakshar nahin karne kaa arth germany par punah akraman hoga
 Finally, the German government accepted the signing of the treaty
 rashtrasang kaa nirmaan evam sanghathan varsay-sandhi kaa ek atyant mahatvapurn ang tha
 The first part of the treaty is related to this
 yah multah raashtrapati wilson kaa srijan tha
 He thought that the League of Nations should be the greatest work of peace conference
 lid jorge ne likhaa he wilson shanti-sandhiyon ke keval us bhaag ko jisamen rashtrasang kii vyavastha thi, sabase adhik mahatv detaa tha
 For this, he was ready to make any sacrifice and in the end it was due to his hard efforts that the League of Nations was created
 wilson ko chhodkar mitrarashtra ke anya pratinidhiyon kaa yah vichaar tha ki rashtrasang sambandhi baton ko varsay-sandhi ke antargat rakhana aavashyak nahin he
 Eventually Wilson agreed and the Constitution of the League of Nations was placed under the Treaty of Versailles

 German Colonial System: The Allies wanted the German colonies to meet in their respective empires, but Wilson strongly opposed it
 wilson ke virodh ke kaaran mitra rashtron ne sangrakshan pranali kii shuruuaat kii
 It was meant that the welfare and development of the countries which are very backward

 According to the 231st section of the treaty, Germany was held liable for all the damage and war
 raajnneetik vyavastha ke antargat rashtrasang kii sthapana varsay kii sandhi kaa mahatvapurn ang thi
 It was because of Wilson's influence that the League of Nations was placed in the Treaty of Warsaw
 rashtrasang kaa uddeshy anterrashtriya sahyog evam suraksha ko kaayam karnaa tha
 In many treaties in world history, the Treaty of Versailles has been the most described and disputed
 vastutah is sandhi ne vishwa itihaas kii dhara ko gahare rup se prabhavit kiya
 These treaties are sharply criticized and understood as the seeds of this Second World War
 nimna binduon ke tahat is sandhi kii aalochana ko dekha ja saktaa he- 1
 Accused Treaty: The Treaty of Warsaw is known as the "accusatory peace", that is, the "accusatory treaty"
 sandhi ko taiyaar karte samay sammelan main germany ko sthaan nahin diya gaya
 This was the order of the Allies which Germany had no other remedy except to accept
 german pratinidhiyon ke dwaara sikaayat karne par bhi unhen dhamkee di gayi kii yadi ve paanch din ke andar sandhi par hastakshar nahin kiye to unke khilaaf punah akraman kar diya jaayegaa
 Therefore, it sat on the mind of Germany that it is an alleged treaty which they are not obliged to obey
 yahi vajah he ki germany ne aage chalakar sandhi praavdhaanon ko thukraa diya
 2
 No peace of public, peace of diplomats: The provisions mentioned in the Treaty of Versailles could not fulfill the interests and aspirations of the general public
 isamen kai aisi pradeshik vyavasthaayen thi jisamen sanshodhan kii jarurat thi
 Several provisions were made in compensation that could not be recovered without causing devastating blow to the industrial revival of Europe
 is tarah jansadharan kii shanti kaa yah sandhi puraa nahin karti
 3
 Strict and Disgraceful Conditions: Germany was shattered by the Treaty of Warsaw, the colonies were stripped financially, the ownership of other nations over economic resources, and the military was crippled
 
 kshatipurti kii shart atyant kathor evam apmanjanak thi
 In the event of non-payment of compensation amount, there was talk of occupying the territories of Germany
 vastutah vijeta raashtra ne pratishodh ke tahat kathor sharton ko germany par ladaa
 The terms of the treaty were so harsh that no self-respecting, cultured nation could bear it
 churchill ke shabdon main “isaki aarthik sharten is had tak kalankapurna tathaa nirbuddha thi ki unhone ne ise spashtatya nirarthak bana diya
 " 4
 sandhi galat sthanon par kathor tathaa galat tareeke se naram thi : yah sandhi keval asaamaanya rup se kathor nahin thi, varan galat sthanon par kathor tathaa galat tareeke se naram thi
 The attempt by Germany to approve so-called war crime provisions was beyond reality because, as David Thomson put it, "mentioning this in a draft that the German delegates were forced to sign cannot create a sense of sense of responsibility
" Were
 ” duusare kshatipurti kii maang bhi asambhav maatra main kii gai thi or isaki vrihat raashi bina kisi gambhir vichaar kiye nishchit kii gai thi
 How it would be possible for the Germans to repay this wealth economically and for the Allies was not analyzed
 nihsandeh dand or muaavje kaa sampurna aakaar aviveki or avyavhaarik tha
 All the above mentioned unnecessary rigors did not take any distinct action against Germany's ability to express national dissatisfaction and anger
 yah sandhi galat tareeke se naram thi, 'saar kshetra' kaa raashtra sangh dwaara 15 varsh tak shashan or 1935 main use germany kaa lautaa dena shaayad hi uchit tha
 The authority of the Allies on Rhineland for 15 years also proved hollow
 5
 pratishodhatmak sandhi : vijeta rashtron ne pratishodhatmak ravaiya apanaakar kathor sharton ko germany par ladaa
 France was seeking to avenge its old defeat and non-compliance, so that the treaty made the most stringent provisions with Germany
 6
 apmanjanak sandhi : yah sandhi germany ke liye rashtriya apmaan kaa kaaran thi
 The overthrow of Kaiser William, recovery of heavy damage supply

 Clemenceau's indecent behavior with German delegates coming for the signing of treaty letters, keeping them as prisoners, abusing the public, throwing rotten fruit, bricks, stones at them, was not an insult to the delegates but to Germany
 7
 vishwasghaatee sandhi : varsay kii sandhi naitik drushti se anuchit va germany ke saath vishwasghaat maani gai
 Germany had accepted a war tax treaty based on Wilson's 14 sources, but these treaties of Wilson were openly violated in the Treaty of Warsaw
 germany ke saath rashtriyata ke siddhant kaa paalan nahin hua tha
 Many conditions were imposed on him
 lekin vijetaon ko usase mukt rakhaa gaya he
 According to Wilson's third source, the attempt was to remove all barriers to international trade, but Germany's collective freedom was not protected
 uskaa antarrashtriya vyapaar varshon tak mitrarashtron ke niyantran main rahaa
 The 14 sources suggested the reduction of arms of all nations, but the Allies severely limited Germany's military power without reducing their arms
 mitra rashtron ne wilson ke 14 sutron kaa paalan usee seemaa tak kiya jahaan tak unhen laabh tha
 Thus Germany was betrayed in the Treaty of Warsaw
 is vishwasghaat kaa badla lene ke liye aage germany ne yuddh kiya
 8
 Ideological Conflicts among the Prophets of the Treaty: The Treaty of Varsay provided a status of conflict among the three elders' opinions and objectives
 wilson ke ucch parantu avyaavhaarik vichaar, climenso ke rashtravaadi va yathartwaadee maangon tathaa lid george ke avasarwaadi uddeshyon ke bich virodh tha, baavjood iske varsay kii sandhi par inaki sahmati thi jo inke samrajyavaadee va shoshan kii maansikta ko pratibibint karata he
 According to Logson "there was intense opposition to Wilson's idealism and materialism of convention, and in most cases materialism emerged victorious
" ” 9
 Beginning of new phase of Conflict: The Treaty of Warsaw marked the beginning of a new struggle for universal power among European nations
 1919 tak anterrashtriya vidhi kisi desh kii sarkaar tathaa uske nagarikon kii sampatti main bhed maanati thi
 But according to the treaty of Warsay, the warring country could seize some kind of property of a person of an enemy country within the border of himself and his allies
 yadi vah yuddh main vijayi hua to parajeet desh kii sarkaar ko apane nagarikon kii idas prakaar jabt kii gai sampatti kii kshatipurti karne ke liye baadhya kar saktaa tha
 This was a new parable
 10
 wimer ganatantr ke prati ghrinaa : yuddh ke baad germany main wimer ganatantr kii sthapana hui or use varsay kii sandhi se jodakar dekha gaya
 Among all the liberal features, it was considered as an institution established by the enemy party
 isliye germany main prajatantr aarambh se hi dwandv, ghrinapatr va shatrupaksh kii vyavastha ban gaya
 11
 Disregard of the principle of self-determination: The boundaries of Italy were not set on the principle of nationalism, nor were all citizens on Poland's land unquestionably polled
 isi prakaar turki ke samrajya ke bhaagon ko surakshit samprabhutaa kaa vachan nahin diya gaya

 The doctrine of self-judgment concerning Germany was disregarded
 raashtrapati wilson ke aatmanirnay ke siddhant ke anusaar europe ke anek rashtron kaa punargathan kiya gaya tha
 According to this, it was decided to create a separate system of people of the same nation, caste, language and cultural tradition
 isi aadhaar par checkoslovakia, poland, yugoslavia ke swatantra rajyon kaa janm hua
 But this principle was not followed in relation to Germany, Austria and Hungary
 germany ke hajaaron nagarikon ko german samrajya se pruthak karke anya rajyon ke adheen kar diya gaya
 "in 1918 AD, when the Austrian Germans established the german-austrian Republic and expressed the desire of the Germans to join the Republic and annex the land, the Allied States banned the annexation of the two states in September 1919 AD
 Gone
 is prakaar mitra rashtron dwaara swayan dwaara sweekrut siddhant ko germany ke vishay main kriyanvit na kar german nagarikon ko niraash kiya gaya
 According to Butlerne, "not using the principle of self-determination in a reasonable sense was an indication of the inherent weakness in the Parisian system
" ” The treaty of Versailles has a special place in the most discussed treaties of world history and its effects
 us sandhi ke kathor praavdhaanon or uske swaroop ke sandarbh main aalochakon ne ise dwitiya vishwayuddh ke kaaran ke rup main paribhaashit kiya he
 According to him, the Treaty of Warsaw was the father of discontent rather than a system of peace
 sandhi ke thik 20 varsh 2 maheene 4 din pashchaat yah sansar dwitiya vishwayuddh ke chapet main aa gaya
 Since the treaty, its arrangements were disbanded by Germany
 saath hi sandhi praavdhaanon main sanshodhan bhi kiye jate rahe
 Violations and amendments of these treaty provisions pushed the world towards World War II
 sandhi praavdhaanon kaa ulanghan evam sanshodhan isliye kiya gaya ki yah atyadhik kathor evam apmanjanak thi
 No self-respecting nation could tolerate the terms of such a harsh and degrading treaty for a long time
 atah yah spasht tha ki germany bhavishya main uparyukt avasar milte hi varsay sandhi dwaara thopi gai vyavastha se mukt hone tathaa apmaan ke kalank dhone kaa prayaas karegaa
 Ezberger of the Catholic Center Party of Germany said at the time of the cease-fire treaty that "the German race will suffer but will not die
 " swabhaavik rup se germany ne is apmanjanak sharton ko dhone kaa safal prayaas kiya
 As a result, within a few years the political atmosphere of Europe became very turbulent and the world had to witness a fierce and catastrophic war even more than the First World War
 france ke marshall foch ke anusaar bhi "yah sandhi shanti nahin he, keval 20 varshon kaa yudhviram he
 "it is clear that the seeds of World War II existed in this treaty
 1919 main sandhi ke samay germany asahaay tha or sandhi ke chupchaap sweekaar karne ke alaava uske paas koi chaara na tha lekin jaise-jaise samay bitta gaya vaise-vaise vah kuch shakti sanchay karke sandhi kii sharton kaa ulanghan karne laga or sandhi nirmaataaon ne bhi usamen sanshodhan kiye
 The first part of the treaty was amended in 1926 when Germany was granted membership of the League of Nations
 yuddh aparaadhiyon sambandhi saatvaan bhaag kabhi purnatah kriyanvit nahin kiya gaya
 Many of the war criminals, including the German Emperor William Kaiser, were punished and only a few were given general punishment
 kshatipurti se sambandhit praavdhaan ko pehle to sanshodhit kiya gaya or baad main purnatah tyaag diya gaya
 The question of indemnification at the Lojan Conference was abolished
 1933-34 main german raajnneeti main hitler ke utkarsh ke baad varsay kii sharton ko todna to ek maamuli baat ho gai
 In 1935–36, Hitler violated the provisions relating to disarmament of the treaty and increased armies and in 1936 took control of Rheinland
 march 1938 main austria ko germany ke saath milakar tathaa sitambar 1938 checkoslovakia ko milakar hitler ne varsay kii sandhi ke pradeshik vyavasthaaon ke praavdhaanon ko bhang kar diya
 World War II started when Hitler invaded Poland with the aim of breaking the Polish Corridor and Danzing Port-related arrangements made by Poland under the Treaty of Versailles
 kuch milakar varsay sandhi kii anyaaypurna vyavasthaaon ko todane ke liye hi hitler ne ghatnaon kii vah shrunkhlaa aarambh kii jiske kaaran dwitiya vishwayuddh kaa visphot hua
 In this way, the final culmination of the process of elimination of the Treaty provisions of Versailles occurred at the beginning of the Second World War
 is drushti se dwitiya vishwayuddh ke beej varsay kii sandhi main dekhe ja sakate hai
 Some critics believe that the World War II was not the harsh condition of the Versailles treaty, but the laxity in implementing them
 logsam ke anusaar- Thus there is no doubt that the unjustly harsh and degrading treaty of Versailles was to a extent liable to World War II
 kintu yah bhi satya he ki mitra rashtron kii paraspar virdohi niti, upeksha, udaseenta, tushtikaran or sandhi kii sharton ko kathortapurvak lagu na karwaane kii niti bhi iske liye kam uttaradaayi nahin thi

 yah afawaah bhi aam he ki 'taklamkaan' kaa matlab 'andar jaaoge to baahar kabhi nahin nikloge' yaa phir 'maut kaa registan' he, lekin yah mahaz galat avadharanaen hi he
 The total area of taklamakan is 3,37,000 sq km, including the Tarim Droni

 aaj tak is kavyagranth kii lakhon pratiyaan bik chuki hai
 Howl's vcds, cds and dvds, directed by Ginsberg, have also sold heavily and his book and DVD are still on sale
 apni is kavita ke liye unhone ek nayi lekhan pranali apanaayi jo saans lene or saans chhodane ke samay par aadhaarit thi
 Although his father was a songwriter, Ginsberg did not think it appropriate to follow the path shown by his father because he felt that American society had changed
 ginsburg kii mata nyomi ginsburg kaa maansik santulan thik nahin tha or iskaa prabhaav kishor ginsburg par bhi rahaa
 After Howl was published, he wrote a long poem called Cadish in memory of his mother, according to Howl

 chaar varsh ke sangharsh ke pashchaat trotski ko parajeet karke vah rus kaa netaa ban baitha
 In 1928, Stalin announced the first five-year plan
 is yojana ke teen mukhya uddeshy the - samuhik krishi, baari udyogon kii sthapana or nae shramik samaaj kaa nirmaan
 The government used to buy the grain produced in the collective farms at a fixed rate and used to rent tractors

 The rich peasants opposed this but they were suppressed
 1940 i
 main 86% ann samuhik kheton main, 12 % sarkari formon main or keval 1 % vyaktigat kisaanon ke kheton main utpann hone laga
 Thus in about 12 years this revolutionary change in agriculture took place in Russia
 udyogon kaa vikaas karne ke liye turkistan main bijli kaa utpaadan badhaayaa gaya
 As a result of the new revolution, in 1937 only 10% of the people remained illiterate whereas before 1917 79% were illiterate

 In this, emphasis was laid on the production of consumer goods

 At the same time special attention was paid to the means of transport and construction of habitat
 chunki isi samay germany main hitler kaa udai hua tathaa usne rus par akraman kii niti apanaai
 Therefore, Stalin had to concentrate on the manufacture of weapons rather than the manufacture of consumer goods
 is kaal main rus main lohe-ispaat tathaa koyale kaa utpaadan kai guna bad gaya
 He became the leading country in the manufacture of tractors, rail engines
 yahi vajah he ki naaji akraman ke dauraan rus ne uskaa safaltaapurvak saamana kiya
 Similarly, it had to be postponed as World War II started in 1938

 It is true that he implemented policies through vigorous oppression, state of terror and dictatorship
 vah nirday hokar desh ke bhitari dushmano ke samaksh pesh hua
 But it is also true that if he did not do this, the only workers' government in the world would have been destroyed by the Nazis
 'pramanbhaar' ke do arth hai : There are many subjects, which do not require proof
 anyaanya sambhddha vishyon ko sakshya ke dwaara pramanit karte hai
 The witness's confession, confession and production of appropriate papers are under evidence
 sakshya dene kaa pratham daayitv us paksh par hai, jise maamle ko praathmik rup main pramanit karnaa he
 Each party has its own responsibility of proof
 jis paksh par pramaan dene kaa daayitv rahata he, vah yadi upyukt sakshya prastut na kare to nyaayalay uske viruddh apana nirnay degaa
 In cases of impunity, the charge remains on the prosecutor
 is niyam kaa koi apwaad nahin he
 The law envisages that the accused is innocent until the indictment brought against him is absolutely undoubtedly proven
 at: aise maamalon main pramanbhaar maamla chalaanevaale par rahata he evam abhiyog kaa prayek charan use hi pramanit karnaa hota he, bhale hi use nakaaratmak vishyavastu par hi sakshya kyon na dena pade
 The accused does not have to prove his innocence
 divaani maamalon main pramanbhaar kaa daayitv us paksh par he, jo vivaadaaspad vishay main apane swatv ko upasthit karata he
 This rule is based on the principle that the party who supports the existence of a subject should only give evidence of it, not the opponent who does not accept the existence of the controversial subject
 at: divaani maamaalon main pramanbhaar vaadi par rahata he
 If he bears that obligation and certifies the case as primary, allowing him to have a loan, then in such a situation the onus of giving evidence against his claim rests with the defendant
 sakshya ke dauraan main pramanbhaar kaa daayitv kab vaadi se prativaadee par evam prativaadee se vaadi par chalaa jaayga, kahana kathin he
 It varies according to the evidence given mutually
 kintu antat: pramanbhaar us paksh par rahata he, jo pratipakshi ke sakshya ke uttar main sakshya nahin dene se, maamle main parajeet hoga
 On the basis of the accepted evidence from the case, the court examines the controversial claim and gives its decision in favor of the party who receives the plurality of evidence
 bahudhaa log dusron ke naam se bhoomi athwa anyaanya sampatti kharidte hai
 These are called 'anonymous'
 jo paksh 'benami' ko nyaayalay se amaanya ghoshit karana chahta he, usee par is baat kaa pramanbhaar rahata he ki vastav main kharidaar koi doosraa hi he tathaa jiske naam sampatti kharidi gai he, vah keval naam kaa hi khariddaar he
 In this context, where the amount of the purchase came from, it is especially worth considering
 kisi divaani maamle main yadi koi paksh yah kahe ki uskaa maamla kisi nirdisht deshaachaar kinwa kulachaar par aadhaarit he tathaa desh kaa saadhaaran kanoon uske maamle main lagu nahin hota to use hi ukt deshaachaar athwa kulachaar ko nirvivaad rup se pramanit karnaa hota he
 In defamation cases, the charge remains on the plaintiff
 use hi pehle sakshya dena padataa he ki vah apane viruddh laae gaye laanchhan ke liye doshi nahin he
 Only after giving his evidence, the defendant can give evidence that he had said or written the same in terms of pure spirit and public interest, against which the plaintiff has filed the case
 yadi sarkaar kii ore se yah daawa kiya jaay ki koi vyakti bina uttaradhikari chode mar gaya he, at: uski sampatti 'aschit' ke kanoon ke anusaar sarkaar kii he to sarkaar par is baat kaa pramanbhaar rahegaa ki sampatti kaa antim adhikari bina uttaradhikari chode mara
 If someone gives money to someone on a forged check, then there will be a charge on the bank that there was no inadvertence on his part in the check
 vidweshpurn maamle ke daawey main vaadi ko hi pramanit karnaa padataa he ki prativaadee ne vidwesh se evam yuktisangat kaaran kaa abhaav rahete hue vaadi par dandabhiyog kaa maamla chalaaya tha
 If a woman's husband says that his woman was in a rascal with another man, then he has to prove the misdeeds of the woman
 hindu vidhaan main kanoon kii aisi koi kalpana nahin he ki sanyukt parivaar hone se hi parivaar ke sadasyon kii sampati sanyukt he
 But if it is accepted or certified that a Hindu family is joint and the property of the joint family is subject to it, then the law is envisaged in that order if the member under different members of the joint family claims the said property in person
 If they do, they will have to give proof that the property is their own, not the joint family
 yadi kisi dastavej kaa nishpaadan pramanit ho, kintu yah kaha jaay ki jis samay dastavej likhaa ja rahaa tha, us samay dastavej banaanevaale veikshipt tha, to mastishk kii veikshipta kaa pramanbhaar dastavej banaanevaale par he
 If the person was deranged before the execution of the document, but it should be said that he was in mental equilibrium at the time of making the document, then the proof of the same would remain on him
 yadi kisi dastavej ke nishpaadan ko pramanit maan liya jaay, kintu usame varnit vishay ko asaty evam nakli kah kar aisa akshep kiya jaay ki uske anusaar kaary karne kaa uddeshy nahin tha, to ukt akshepkaaree par is kathan kaa pramanbhaar rahegaa
 If any document registered or not accepted is accepted in the case, then the proof that there was no consideration in it is on the creator of the document
 divaani maamalon main pramanbhaar ke prasang main lagu ukt saadhaaran kanoon ke do vikalp he : In the appeal of the prosecution, the charge generally rests on the prosecutor
 nyaayalay ko yah dekhnaa hota he ki abhiyukt ko diya gaya dand thik he yaa nahin
 If there is an appeal against a decision where the accused has been freed, the liability of the prosecutor is even greater on the person conducting the case
 divaani apil main pramanbhaar apil karanevaale par he
 He only has to prove that the decision given under appeal is wrong

 In line with the majority of hitherto unselected planetary planets, HD 217107 was also downgraded due to the detection of small variations in the radius of its orbiting star due to its gravitational pull

 a planet with a rotation period of 10 days is often almost a circular orbit, but HD 217107b's orbit is slightly centered and its explorers hypothesized that it was due to the gravitational effect of a second planet in a system located at a distance of several astronomical units
