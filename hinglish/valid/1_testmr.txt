 Scheinberg denied any involvement in Howard Duck, claiming that he never read the screenplay
 huyek or katz ne dridhtaa se mahasoos kiya ki film anemated honi chahie

 The prevailing statement regarding Kabir's Guru is that Kabir was looking for a suitable Guru
 vah vaishnav sant acharya ramanand ko apana apana guru bananaa chaahate the lekin unhone kabir ko shishy banane se manaa kar diya lekin kabir ne apane man main thaan liya ki swami ramanand ko hi har keemat par apana guru banaaungaa ,iske liye kabir ke man main ek vichaar aayaa ki swami ramanand ji subah chaar baje ganga snaan karne jate hai uske pehle hi unke jane ke maarg main sidhiyon let jaaounga or unhone aisa hi kiya
 One day, Kabir fell on the stairs of the Panchganga Ghat as soon as one night
 ramanand ji gangasnan karne ke liye seedhiyaan utar rahe the ki tabhi unka pair kabir ke sharir par pad gaya
 The word 'ram-ram' immediately came out of his mouth
 usee ram ko kabir ne diksha-mantra maan liya or ramanand ji ko apana guru sweekaar kar liya
 In Kabir's own words- jivicoparjan ke liye kabir julahe kaa kaam karte the
 Kabir had a strong belief that one gets his end in accordance with his deeds and not because of particular place
 apni is manyata ko siddh karne ke liye ant samay main vah magahar chale gaye ;kyonki logon manyata thi ki kaashi main marane par swarg or magahar main marane par narak miltaa he
 He breathed his last in Maghar

 And sometimes "what happened if i grew up" us samay hindu janata par muslim aatank kaa kahar chaaya hua tha
 Kabir organized his creed in such a way that the people leaning towards the Muslim faith became his followers

 Kabir's Ram is not even a monotheistic, monotheistic God of Islam
 islam main khuda yaa allaah ko samast jagat evam jeevon se bhinn evam param samarth mana jaataa he
 But Ram of Kabir may be supremely capable, but he is never different from all beings and the world
 balki iske vipareet ve to sabamein vyaapt rahane vaale ramata ram hai
 He says that the universal Brahman Sabnimayi I, will worship the Pandit
 ravan-raav kawnasuun kavan veda ko rogi
 Kabir does not imagine any special design of Rama, because Rama would be bound in a particular structure as soon as he imagined the design, which was not acceptable to Kabir under any circumstances
 kabir ram kii avadharana ko ek bhinn or vyapak swaroop dena chaahate the
 There were some specific reasons for this, which we will discuss further in this article
 kintu iske baavjood kabir ram ke saath ek vyaktigat paariwarik kism kaa sambandh jarur sthapit karte hai
 His love for Rama is distinguished by his supernatural and glorious power without forgetting even a single moment on the surface of a spontaneous romantic human relationship
 kabir naam main vishwaas rakhte hai, rup main nahin
 Although it is commonly distinguished in the principles of devotion-sensation that 'the name is greater than the form', Kabir made this general principle a revolutionary use
 kabir ne ram-naam ke saath lokmanas main shatabdiyon se rache-based sanshlisht bhaavon ko udaatt evam vyapak swaroop dekar use puraana-pratipaadit brahmanvaadi vichaardhaara ke khaanche main baandhe jane se rokane kii koshish kii
 Kabir's Ram is beyond the distinction of nirgun-saguna
 darasal unhone apane ram ko shaastra-pratipaadit avtari, sagun, varchaswashil varnashram vyavastha ke sangrakshak ram se alag karne ke liye hi ‘nirgun ram’ shabd kaa prayog kiya–‘nirgun ram japahu re bhai
 There is no need to get confused about this 'nirguna' word
 kabir kaa aashay is shabd se sirf itnaa he ki ishwar ko kisi naam, rup, gun, kaal aadi kii simaaon main bandha nahin ja saktaa
 Those who are beyond all limits and still everywhere, are Nirgun Rama of Kabir
 ise unhone ‘ramata ram’ naam diya he
 Despite giving his Nirguna adjective to Rama, Kabir talks of a kind of human love affair with him
 kabhi vah ram ko maadhurya bhav se apana premi yaa pati maan lete hai to kabhi daasya bhav se swami
 Sometimes he considers Rama as the mother of Vatsalya idol and himself as his son
 nirgun-niraakaar brahm ke saath bhi is tarah kaa saras, sahaj, maanviya prem kabir kii bhakthi kii vilakshantaa he
 This dilemma and problem may occur to others that how Ram, with whom Kabir is so unique, human relational, can be good, but it is not a problem for Kabir himself
 vah kehete bhi hai “santau, dhokhaa kaasuun kahiye
 Gunam i nirgun, nirgunam gun, baat chaandi kya bahis! profesar mahavir saran jain ne kabir ke ram evam kabir kii sadhana ke sambandh main apane vichaar vyakt karte hue kaha he : " kabir kaa sara jivan satya kii khoj tathaa asaty ke khandan main vyateet hua
 Kabir's cultivation begins by knowing "not obeying"
 ve kisi ke shishy nahin, ramanand dwaara chetaye hue chela hai
 For him, Rama is not a form, Dasharathi is not Rama, his Rama is a symbol of spiritual practice
 unke ram kisi sampradaay, jati yaa desh kii simaaon main kaid nahin he
 In the particle of nature, even in Ramana in the limb, which one cannot touch, he is Alakh, the imperishable, the supreme element Rama
 unke ram manushya or manushya ke bich kisi bhed-bhav ke kaarak nahin hai
 They are the symbols of the element of love
 bhav se upar uthakar mahabhaav yaa prem ke aradhy hai - 'prem jagavai virah ko, virah jagavai piu, piu jagavai jeeva, joi piu soi jiu' - the one who is piu is the same creature
 isi kaaran unki puri sadhana ‘‘hans ubaaran aae kii sadhana he
 This goose cannot be revived by the reading of Pothis, and two and a half can be done only by the conduct of love
 dharm odhane kii cheez nahin he, jivan main aacharan karne kii satat satya sadhana he
 His practice begins with love
 itnaa gaharaa prem karo ki vahi tumhaare liye paramatma ho jaae
 There is so much eagerness to get it that one becomes the most reclusive, disrespectful, only then can that meditation be awakened in meditation
 vahi piu tumhaare arntman main baithe jeev ko jagaa saktaa he
 Joi Peiu is Soi Jiu
 tab tum puure sansar se prem karoge, tab sansar kaa prayek jeev tumhaare prem kaa paatr ban jayega
 All arrogance, all malice will go away
 phir mahabhaav jagega
 With this great spirit, the whole world becomes Piu's home

 so successful in his efforts to restore peace and confidence that within less than a year some three hundred deserted towns and villages were re-peopled, trade revived, and, in spite of the abolition of transit duties and the reduction of frontier customs, the state revenue had reached an amount never before known
 During the next five years Tod earned the respect of both the chiefs and the people; and was able to rescue more than one princely family, including that of the ranas of Udaipur, from the destitution to which they had been reduced by Mahratta raiders

 beharapali raigarh mandal main bharat ke chhattisgarh rajya ke antargat raigarh jile kaa ek gaanv he
 Storrer, while defining histology or ontology, wrote: Histology is the study of the structure and configuration of tissues within the microscopic body organs
 angareji kaa hystology shabd unani bhashaa ke shabd histos tathaa logia se milakar bana he, jinka arth hota he utakon kaa adhyayan
 Hence histology is the science under which the microstructure of tissues and their arrangement or configuration is studied
 'utak' shabd francisi bhashaa ke shabd tissue se niklaa he, jiskaa arth hota he sanrachana yaa banaavat 
 The term was first used by French body scientist Bisshat in the late 18th century in the context of body or anatomy
 unhone apni pustak main lagbhag bi prakaar ke utakon kaa ullekh kiya he
 However, nowadays only four types of main tissues are recognized, namely: epithylomy, connective, muscular and neural tissue
 adikaal se hi manushya pashu-pakshiyon or ped-paudhon ko unki akruti tathaa aakaar ke dwaara pahachaanata rahaa he
 With the development of science, curiosity was also generated to know the structure inside the body of flora and fauna
 isi jigyaasa ke falswaroop shalyakriya kaa vikaas hua
 Medical and biologists began to dissect animals and flora and study the structure of their organs - organ reactions
 isi adhyayan ke falswaroop sampurna sharir kii utpatti hui
 With this, when the microscope instruments developed, complex internal structures also became clear
 is sookshmdarsheey yantric adhyayan ko bhautikee kii sangya pradaan kii gai
 Therefore, in Bloom and Fawcett's words, 'under the body of microscopic or microscopic body comes the internal structure of the body which cannot be seen by naked eyes
 samast sajiv praaniyon kii sanrachanaatmak tathaa kriyaatmak ikai koshika hoti he
 The study of this cell is called cytology
 koshikaon ke punjon se utakon or utakon se angon kii rachana hoti hai
 The science that studies the structure of tissues is called physics and the science that studies the structure of organs is called body
 ootiki tathaa koshika vigyaan ke adhyayanon ke kaaran sharir ke durbhedya rahasyon kaa bhedan hota gaya
 Conducted studies of these two led to the development of optics-pathology
 san 1932 main nol evam raska ne electron sookshmdarshi kaa avishkaar kiya, jisase koshikaon tathaa utakon kii jatiltam saranchanaaon kaa spashtikaran hua
 Along with this, physiology also developed and new new mysteries were revealed
 is prakaar in teenon vigyaanon ke sammilit prayaas se jeevvaigyanik kshetra main abhootpurv kranti ai he
 Ecology and cytology mainly explain the morphological pattern of microstructures
 kintu jab se aneleen ranjakon kaa anveshan hua tab se koshikaon kii jatil sanrachanaon kaa bhi gyaan praapt hone laga he
 Today, hundreds of types of pigments are being used to shed light on microscopic structures
 is prakaar, ootiki ke kshetra main ab rasayanavigyaan kaa bhi pravesh ho gaya he
 Proper knowledge of chemical reactions of dyes is being gained by using regular stabilizers
 jeevadravya, koshika dravya tathaa unamem or koshikaon ke anek angakon kii rasinic sanrachanaon kaa gyaan ab sarsaadhaaran ke liye sulabh he
 How these organs perform specialized work is no longer unknown
 sookshm sanrachanaon kii rasinic prakruti ke adhyayan ko ootikirasayan yaa koshikarsayan kaha jaataa he or ab ootiki tathaa ootikirasayan kaa ek saath adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 According to Helen Dean, there are three major categories of such studies: beli kii ootiki vishay par likhi pustak main utak vigyaan ke saath hi koshika vaigyanik adhyayan par bhi bal diya gaya he
 According to Bailey, since histology is a structural study and complements the anatomical knowledge gained by dissection, it is also necessary to emphasize its close connection with physiology and pathology
 
 According to them, the basis of histology is cytoplasm or cytology
 uparyukt vivaran se yah prakat hota he ki koshikavigyaan tathaa oothkavigyaan kaa ek saath adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 Since cells are microscopic structures, we will study histology by considering histology to be synonymous with microtubules
 chunki utak koshikaon dwaara hi bane hote hai, at: ootiki kaa adhyayan ham koshikaon ke hi madhyam se karenge
 For proper study of tissues, it is necessary that they are treated by special methods before bringing them to the microscope
 utak kaa sookshm adhyayan karne ke liye yah anivaary he ki vah ati patala ho
 Many similarities are found in different parts of living tissue
 at: uskaa thik thik adhyayan sambhav nahin hota
 To overcome these difficulties, tissue is first dissected from 4 to 8 microns
 is kaary ke liye 'microtome' yantra kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Such microscopic rupture of living tissue is not possible unless it is stiff
 at: utak ko kadaa karne ke liye use vishesh prakaar ke rasayanon ke ghol main sthaayeekrut kiya jaataa he
 After immobilization, this tissue is treated and sterilized in various solutions of alcohols, stains and other chemicals
 ant main ise vishesh taap par pehle se hi galaakar taiyaar rakhaa jaataa he, daal diya jaataa he
 After some time, pieces of tissue along with wax are put into a quadrilateral mold
 jab mom jamkar kadaa ho jaataa he, to uske chote chote tukade kaat liye jate hai
 Finally these pieces are deposited in a special part of the microtome and several sections of special thickness are cut with a sharpened knife
 in sectionon ko kaanch kii pattiyon par rakhkar adhyayan ke liye rakh liya jaataa he
 Wax is dissolved by placing the glass strips on the heating plate and the section of tissue freezes on the glass strip
 in sectionon se ladi kaanch kii pattiyon ko vishesh rasayanon tathaa alcohol ke gholon main nirjal kar liya jaataa he
 It is then soaked in dilene or sedar ud oil
 ab yah section sookshm adhyayan ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 Internal microscopes are used for microscopic study of these sections
 aajkal utakon kaa adhyayan karne ke liye is prakaar ke microscopon kaa atyadhik prayog hone laga he
 For this microscopic study, methods of thermodynamic and radiation autocorrelation are being used
 ootikirasayan ke antargat utakon ke vibhinn bhaagon kii rasinic sanrachana kaa adhyayan hota he
 The radiation autoregression method involves the insertion of special types of radioisotopes into the specialized tissue of living organisms
 is prakaar se upachaarikrut utakon ko jantusharir se baahar nikaalkar section bana liye jate hai
 By taking these sections in the dark room, they are captured by special chemicals of photography, or placed under the film and tied firmly
 kuch samay baad inhen andhere kaksh se baahar nikaalkar sthaayeekrut kar liya jaataa he
 Thereafter, they are studied by bringing them into the light
 utakon kaa adhyayan unki sookshm sanrachana kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Therefore, a brief mention of the structure of the tissue is necessary
 utakon kii sanrachana main teen prakaar ke mukhya ghatak dikhalaai dete hai : koshikaaye, matrix tathaa taral dravya
 The unit of tissue is a cell
 koshikaaye sajiv hoti hai tathaa ve sabhi kaary karti hai, jinhen sajiv praani karte hai
 Their shape is minimal and shape is spherical, oval, columnar, porous, flagellate, polygonal etc
 ye jelly jaisi ek vastu dwaara aavrutt hoti hai
 This coating is called cytoplasm or cell membrane
 ise kabhi-kabhi jeev-dravya-kala bhi kaha jaataa he
 The following structures are found within it: - cendrak evam kendrika Organism golgi sammishra yaa yantra Kanabha sutra antarpradravya dalika Chromosomes and genes rebosom tathaa centrosom Lavak matrix yaa aadhatri ko intercellular yaa ground sabstens bhi kaha jaataa he
 As is clear from the name itself, it is located in the central part of the cells and works to connect them together
 ye sajiv tathaa nirjeev donon prakaar kii hoti hai
 Ordinarily found in connective tissues
 yah tantu yaa reshon dwaara bani hoti he, jo teen prakaar ke hote hai : kolazanee, jalidaar tathaa elastic 
 It is a homogeneous or homogeneous material that lives in liquid or gelatin-like conditions
 yah upakalaa, koshikaon tathaa choti-choti shiraaon ke neeche jami rahati he
 It contains mucopolysaccharide acids
 aadhatri komal tathaa drudh donon prakaar kii hoti he
 Tissues also contain fluids, of which blood and lymph are the main ones
 ye donon aashyon athwa nalikaaon se hokar pravaahit hote hai
 Tissue keeps liquid cells moisturized
 adhatu ke hi kaaran sharir kaa swaroop bana rahata he
 The body of an animal is really nothing else, but a palace of intracellular matter or half, in which the bricks of billions of cells of many color forms and sizes are selected
 ye koshikaaye apane utpaadon kaa aadan pradaan karti hui apana jivan vyateet karti rahati hai
 Histology also gives proper information about the organs of the body
 angatantron kii saranchana, rasinic prakruti evam kaarividhiyon kaa gyaan praapt karne ke liye utak vigyaan kaa sahaara lenaa padataa he

 at: unke geeton main yah kaamana he ki yah anand sadaa bana rahe, badhata rahe or kabhi samaapt na ho
 He wished that we would enjoy this bliss for the entire hundred years and the generations after us should also be satisfied
 yahi nahin kaamana yah bhi kii gai ki is jivan ke samaapt hone par ham swarg main jaaen or is sukh va anand kii nirantarata vahaan bhi bani rahe
 Various rituals were also performed to achieve this purpose and these boons were also sought from them by organizing to please the gods
 jab prakruti karavat leti thi to prakritik vipadaaon kaa saamana hota tha
 Then the rituals to appease and please the imaginary control gods of those plagues, such as Marut, Agni, Rudra, etc
 were performed and they were prayed not to let such plagues come and protect the subjects upon their arrival
 kul milakar vaidic kaal ke logon kaa jivan prafullit, ahladamay, sukhaakankshi, ashaavadi or jijeevishaapurna tha
 There was no shadow of sadness, sin or miserable life in them
 narak va usamen milane vaali yaatnaaon kii kalpana tak nahin kii gai thi
 Karma was considered to be yajna and yajna itself and the concept of attainment of all its pleasures and redress of hazards
 yah jeevanstyli dirghakaal tak chali
 But how long would this go on? ek na ek din to manushya ke anant jigyaasu mastishk main or vartmaan se kabhi santusht na hone vaale man main yah jigyaasa, yah prashn uthanaa hi tha ki prakruti kii is vishaal rangabhumi ke peeche sutaradhar koun he, iskaa sristaa / nirmaataa koun he, iskaa udgam kahan he, ham koun hai, kahan se aae hai, yah sristi antat: kahan jaaegi
 What will happen to us? Shanai: -shanai: These questions sprouted
 or phir shuru hui in sabake uttar khojane kii lalak tathaa jigyaasu man-mastishk kii anant khoj yatra
 It is not that the Vedic sages never thought about soul, rebirth and karmaphalvad
 aisa bhi nahin tha ki is jivan ke bare main unka koi dhyaan na tha
 The sages had also occasionally considered this subject
 iske beej vedon main yatra-tatra milte hai, parantu yah keval vichaar maatr tha
 No worries or fears
 aatma sharir se bhinn tatv he or is jivan kii samaapti ke baad vah paralok ko jaati he is siddhant kaa abhas vaidic richaon main miltaa avashya he parantu sansar main aatma kaa avaagaman kyon hota he, isaki khoj main vaidic rishi pravrutt nahin hue
 Worldly life with all its limitations was the beloved of the Vedic sages
 prey ko chhodkar shrey kii ore badhane kii aturata upanishdon ke samay jaagi, tab moksh ke saamne grahastha jivan nissar ho gaya evam jab log jivan se anand lene ke bajaay usase peeth pherakar sanyas lene lage
 Yes, it also happened that Vedic sages used to calm down by asking 'who created this world?' And 'who is the god whom we worship'? There, the sages of the Upanishads decided some principles regarding the creator and also found out the 'truth' which is the right to worship and worship
 vaidic dharm kaa purana aakhyaan veda or naveen aakhyaan upanishad hai
 'yajna-dharma was performed in the Vedas and people were taught that to be happy, prosperous and successful and victorious in this life, it is necessary to perform sacrifices for the satisfaction and happiness of the gods
 'vishwa kii utpatti kaa sthaan yajna he
 Yajna is the best of all actions
 yajna ke karmfal se swarg kii prapti hoti he
 'these sutras were all around
 duusare, jab brahman granthon ne yajna ko bahut adhik mahatv de diya or purohitwaad tathaa purohiton kii manamaani atyadhik bad gai tab is vyavastha ke viruddh pratikriya hui or virodh kii bhaavana kaa sutarapaat hua
 People started thinking 'what is the real meaning of Yajna?' 'what secret is there within them?' 'what form of religion do they symbolize?' 'will they lead us to the ultimate goal of life?' Thus, too much emphasis on rituals and the tendency of rituals to be presented as the solution to all the problems of life, led the thinking people to rethink about them
 prakruti ke prayek rup main ek niyantrak devtaa kii kalpana karte-karte vaidic arya bahudevvaadi ho gaye the
 Among his deities are Indra, Varuna, Agni, Savita, Som, Ashwini Kumar, Marut, Pushan, Mitra, Pitar, Yama etc
 tab ek bauddhik vyagrata prarambh hui us ek paramashkti ke darshan karne yaa uske vaastavik swaroop ko samajhane kii ki jo sampurna sristi kaa rachayita or in devataaon ke upar kii satta he
 This anxiety paved the way for the Upanishads
 upanishad chintansheel evam kalpashil manishiyon kii darshanik kavy rachanaayen hai
 Where the prose has been written, they are also such words-power, phonetics, love and semantics in the poetry prose that they give an impression of the works of some divine power
 yah sachmuch atyukti nahin he ki unhen 'mantra' yaa 'richa' kaha gaya
 In fact, the Mantra or Richa is related to the Vedas but these nouns are also used here by some scholars to indicate the affinity of the Upanishads
 upanishad apane aasapaas ke drishy sansar ke peeche jhaankane ke praytn hai
 There are no tools available for it and no research and research facilities are possible
 apni manshchetana, maansik anubhuti yaa antardrushti ke aadhaar par hue aadhyatmik sphuran yaa divya prakaash ko hi varnan kaa aadhaar banaaya gaya he
 The Upanishads are diverse chapters of spiritualism written by various inspired sages
 inamen vishwa kii paramsatta ke swaroop, uske avasthaan, vibhinn prakritik shaktiyon ke saath uske sambandh, maanviya aatma main uski ek kiran kii jhalak yaa sookshm pratibimb kii upasthiti aadi ko vibhinn rupakon or pratikon ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 An attempt has been made to present the design through various images and symbols, arising out of deep thinking and self-thinking in relation to the origin of the creation and its creation
 ant main kaha yah gaya ki hamaari shreshth pariklpana ke aadhaar par jo kuch ham samaj sake, vah yah he
 Beyond this, perhaps only God knows this secret and 'he might not even know
 ' In short, in the Vedas, efforts were made to understand the nature of the visible and manifest natural powers in this world, to worship them by worshiping them, appeasing them and securing worldly success and prosperity and protection from them
 un tak apni shraddha ko pahunchaane kaa madhyam yagyon ko banaaya gaya tha
 The Upanishads describe the many efforts that were made with the desire to interview the supreme power behind these natural powers or the supreme power of creation
 maanviya kalpana, chintan-kshamta, antardrushti kii kshamta jahaan tak us samay ke darshanikon, manishiyon yaa rishiyon ko pahunchaa sakin unhone pahunchne kaa bharsak praytn kiya
 This was his tenacity
 veda ke chaar bhaag hai - samhita, brahman, aaranyak or upanishad
 The Upanishads depict self and non-self elements which represent the fundamental mysteries of the Vedas
 praaia: upanishad veda ke ant main hi aate hai
 Therefore, they are also known as Vedanta
 vaidic dharm ke moulik siddhanton ko teen pramukh granth pramanit karte hai jo prasthaantrayee ke naam se vikhyath hai, ye hai - upanishad, brahmasutra or shrimadbhagavadgita
 The Upanishads signify Brahmanism
 kehete hai is vidya ke abhyaas se mumukshujan kii avidya nasht ho jaati he ; vah brahm kii prapti kara detii he ; jisase manushyon ke garbhavas aadi sansaarik du:kha sarvatha shithil ho jate hai 
 As a result, the Upanishads are considered to be 'tattva' exponent texts, through practice of which a person is interviewed by Brahma or the Supreme Soul

 According to Don, Karachi, Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi had fought for the independence of British India and an exploitation-free society in India
 
 Ubaidullah was born in Uppal Khatri family of Sialkot district of Punjab, British India
 ubydulla ke janm se chaar maheene pehle unke pita kii mrityu ho gai thi, or jinhen dadaji dwaara do saal tak paala tha
 After the paternal grandfather's death, later Ubaidullah was entrusted to care for his uncle in the Jampur Tehsil of Punjab, British India, when his grandfather died

 Maulana Sindhi returned to darul-uloom Deoband in 1909, and gradually joined the pan-islamic movement
 pratham vishwa yuddh ke dauraan, vah devband skool ke netaaon main se ek the, jinhone moulana mahmud al hasan kii aguai main bharat chhod diya tha, jise bharat main ek pan-islamic kranti or resham patr shadyantr ke liye duniya ke anya rashtron ke bich samarthan lene ke liye bharat chhod diya gaya tha
 
 afgaan amir habibullah khan ko raily dene ke liye ubydulla yuddh ke dauraan kabul pahunche the, or thodi der ke baad, unhone german samarthan ke saath british bharat main kranti ke liye raja mahendra pratap kii yojanaon ko apana samarthan diya
 He joined the provisional government of India formed in Kabul in December 1915, and remained in Afghanistan until the end of World War I, and then left for Russia
 baad main unhone turki main do saal bitaye or kai deshon se guzarane ke baad antat hijaaj pahunche jahaan unhone islam ke darshan par vishesh rup se shah valullah dehalavi ke kaaryon ke prakaash main seekhney or sochane main 14 saal bitaye
 In his early career he was a pan-islamic thinker
 haalanki, shah valullah ke kaaryon ke adhyayan ke baad, ubydulla sindhi gaiyr-paan-islamic vidwaan ke rup main ubhare
 He was one of the most active and prominent members of the faction of the Indian independence movement, led by a predominantly Muslim clergy from the Islamic School of Deband
 jab vah skool main te, to ek hindu mitra ne unhen padhane ke liye tuftul hind pustak di
 It was written by Maulana Ubaidullah, a converted scholar from Malarkotla
 is pustak ko padhane ke baad or takviatul imaan or ahwaal ul akhira jaisi kuch anya kitaaben padhane ke baad, islam main ubydulla kii dilchaspee badi, jisase antat islam main unke dharmantaran ho gaya
 In 1887, the year of his conversion, he moved from Punjab to Sindh area where he was taken as a student by Hafiz Muhammad Siddiqui of Chavinda
 baad main unhone moulana gulam mohammad ke tahat dinpur gaanv main adhyayan kiya jahaan unhone islamic shiksha or rahasyamay kram main prashikshan main gaharaai se pahunchaaya
 In 1888, Ubaidullah was admitted to Darul Uloom Deoband, where he studied various Islamic subjects in depth under the tutelage of Islamic scholars including Maulana Abu Siraj, Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi and Maulana Mahmood Al Hasan
 unhone moulana nazir hossain dehalavi se sahih al bukhari or tirmidhi main sabak liya or moulana ahamed hasan konpuri ke saath tark or darshan padhaa
 In 1891, Ubaidullah graduated from the Deoband School
 vah sindh praant ke sukkur kshetra ke liye chale gaye, or amrit sharif main yaa moulana taj mohammad amarothi ke saath padhanaa shuru kiya, jo bhaar chandi ke hafiz mohammad siddiki kii mrityu ke baad unke salaahkaar bane
 Ubaidullah married the daughter of Maulana Azimullah Khan, a teacher at Islamia High School at the time
 1901 main, ubydulla ne sindh ke goth pir jhanda gaanv main daarul irshaad kii sthapana kii
 He worked on promoting his school for almost seven years
 1909 main, mahmud al-hasan ke anurodh par, vah uttar pradesh main devband skool laut aae
 Here, he achieved a lot for the student body, Jamiatul Ansar
 ubydulla ab british virdohi prachaar gatividhiyon main bahut sakriy the, jisase unhen badi sankhya main devband skool ke netaaon ko vichlit kar diya gaya
 Subsequently, Ubaidullah shifted his work to Delhi at the request of Mahmud Al Hasan
 dilli main, unhone haakim ajmal khan or dow ansaari ke saath kaam kiya
 In 1912, he founded a madrassah, Nazazatrul Marif, which succeeded in spreading and spreading Islam among the people
 1914 main pratham vishwa yuddh kii shuruyaat ke saath, daarul ulum devband ne vishwa ke anya sahanubhutipurna rashtron kii sahaayta se british bharat main pan-islam ke kaaran ko aage badhaane ke prayaas kiye
 Under the leadership of Mahmud Al Hasan, plans were drawn up for an insurgency that began in the tribal belt of the Northwest Frontier Province of British India
 
 mahmud al hasan ne hijaaj ke turki governor galeeb pasha kii madad lene ke liye bharat chhod diya, jabaki hasan ke nirdeshon par, ubydulla ne amir habibullah ke samarthan kii talash main kabul kii ore agrasar kiya
 The initial plans were the headquarters of the Islamic army in Medina, with an Indian contingent in Kabul
 moulana hasan is sena ke general-in-chif the
 
 Some of the students of Ubaydullah went to Kabul before some of the students of Ubaidullah reached there
 kabul main rahete hue, ubydulla is nishkarsh par pahunche ki bhartiya swatantraaa andolan par dhyaan kendrit karne se pan islamic kaaran sabase acha hoga
 
 Ubaidullah proposed to the Afghan emir to declare war against British India
 
 moulana abul kalam aaazaad 1916 main unki giraftaar se pehle andolan main shaamil hone ke liye jane jate the
 
 moulana ubydulla sindhi or mahmud al hasan oktober 1915 main british bharat ke janajaatiy belt main muslim vidroh shuru karne kii yojana ke saath kabul gaye the
 For this purpose, Ubaid Allah proposed that the emir of Afghanistan declare war against Britain while Mahmud al-hasan sought German and Turkish help
 hasan hijaaj chale gaye
 Meanwhile, Ubaidullah was able to establish friendly relations with Afghanistan's emir Habibullah
 kabul main, ubydulla apane kuch chaatro ke saath, britain ke khilaaf khalipha ke "jihad" main shaamil hone ke liye turki jane kaa rasta bana rahe the
 But it was ultimately decided that the pan-islamic cause should be best served by focusing on the Indian independence movement
 
 In late 1915, Sindhi was met in Kabul by the 'niedermayer-hentig Campaign' sent by the Indian Freedom Committee and the German War Ministry in Berlin
 aam taur par nirvasit bhartiya rajkumaar raja mahendra pratap kii aguai main, iske sadasyon main islamic vidwaan abdul hafiz mohammad barakatullah or german adhikari varnor oto won hentig or oskar nideramer ke saath-saath kai anya ullekhneey vyakti bhi the
 The campaign tried to rally the support of Emir Habibullah, and through him, launched a campaign in British India
 yah ummid thi ki yah british bharat main vidroh shuru karegaa
 On 1 December 1915, the Provisional Government of India was established in Amir Habibullah's 'bagh-e-babar Mahal' in the presence of Indian, German and Turkish members of the expedition
 ise 'krantikari sarkaar-nirvaasan' ghoshit kiya gaya tha, jo british adhikaar ko khatm kar diya gaya tha jab swatantra bharat kaa prabhaar lenaa tha
 
 Mahendra Pratap was declared President, Barakatullah Prime Minister, Ubaidullah Sindhi Minister of India, another Deobandi leader Maulvi Bashir was his Minister of War, and Champakaran Pillai was Foreign Minister
 
 bharat kii anantim sarkaar ne galeeb pasha se samarthan praapt kiya or britain ke khilaaf jihad ghoshit kiya
 Recognition was sought from the Russian Empire, Republican China and Japan
 
 baad main yah asthaayee sarkaar soviet netritv se samarthan praapt karne kaa prayaas karegi
 After the February revolution in Russia in 1917, Pratap's government matched the neo-soviet government
 1918 main, mahendra pratap ne berlin main kaisar se milane se pehle petrogred main trotski se mulaakaat kii, donon british bharat ke khilaaf sangathit hone kaa aagrah kiya
 
however, these plans went haywire, Amir Habibullah remained firmly neutral while awaiting a concrete signal where the war presided, even as his advisory council and family members indicated their support against Britain
 germanon ne 1917 main apana samarthan waapas le liya, lekin 'bharat kii anantim sarkaar' kabul main peeche rah gai
 In 1919, this government was finally dissolved under British diplomatic pressure on Afghanistan
 ubydulla lagbhag saat varshon tak kabul main rahe the
 He also encouraged the young king Amanullah Khan, who took power in Afghanistan after Habibullah was killed in the Third anglo-afghan War
 antat, yuddh ke samaapan ne ubydulla sindhi ko afghanistan chhodane ke liye majaboor kar diya kyonki raja amanulla britain se dabaav main ho gaya tha
 
 ubydulla tab afghanistan se rus chale gaye, jahaan unhone soviet netritv ke nimantran par saat maheene bitaye, or unhen aadhikarik taur par rajya ke atithi ke rup main mana jaataa tha
 During this period, he studied the ideology of socialism
 'samaajwaad or islam' naamak pakistan ke ek pramukh samachar patr main ek lekh ke mutabik, islam ne garibon or kamjor logon ke liye keval gahari sahanubhuti dikhaai nahin di balki makka suuraton main dhan kii ekaagratha kii drudh ninda kii
 Mecca, an important center of international trade, was home to the very rich and the very poor
 rus main, haalanki, vah lenin se milane main asamarth thi, jo us samay gambhir rup se biimaar tha
 Some people thought at the time that Sindhis were influenced by communist ideals during their stay in Russia, although this is not true
 1923 main, ubydulla ne turki ke liye rus chhod diya jahaan unhone 1924 main 'shah valulla andolan' ke tisare charan kii shuruyaat kii
 He issued a 'charter for the independence of India' from Istanbul
 tab ubydulla 1927 main makka, arab ke liye ravaanaa hue or 1929 tak vahaan rahe
 During this period, he brought the message of the rights of Muslims and other important religious issues to the people of Arabia
 rus main rahane ke dauraan, vah communist vichaaron se prabhavit nahin the balki soviet kranti ke baad, unhone soviet sarkaar ko apana vishwaas vyakt kiya ki: "samyawad ek prakritik kanoon pranali nahin he balki balki daman, prakritik islam dwaara kanoon kii peshkash kii jaati he
 He tried to persuade them in a systematic and logical way
 lekin us samay vah jawaab nahin de sakaa, jab unhen islam ke kanoonon ke anusaar chalaae ja rahe rajya kaa udhaaharan pradaan karne ke liye kaha gaya
 Pakistani columnist Ferman Nawaz has translated his Urdu articles
 islam ne manushyon ko sadbhaav kaa sabak sikhaaya, maanavtaa ke mul naitik maanakon, sabhyataa kii siddhant, sabase achche or islam kii uttarjivita
 Ubaidullah Sindhi believed that the Quran uses Arabic words to illustrate what God believes to be right and wrong
 bible, gita or torah jaisi anya dharmik pavitra pustaken bhi duniya bhar ke kai logon dwaara padi kii jaati hai
 He felt that non-religious people also existed in this world
 aakhir main unhone rus main communiston ke bich kuch samay bitaayaa tha
 Individuals who incorrectly interpreted the Bible and the Torah were declared unbelievers by Islam
 isi tarah, jo vyakti quran ko galat tareeke se samajhaata he, use naastik ghoshit kiya ja saktaa he
 Islam and Prophet Hazrat Muhammad Sahab taught people to respect and tolerance for other religions and to work together with others on this earth
 quran spasht rup se bataata he ki yahudee or isai bhi 'pustak ke log' hai, jiskaa arth he sarvashaktimaan ishwar ne unhen ibrahim, musa or yishu jaise kai bhavishyadvaktaaon ke saath bhi aashirwad diya or sabhi ne hazarat mohammad sahaab ke janm ke pehle logon ko bhagwaan kaa sandesh bataaya
 In Islam, the emphasis is clearly on God being universal and everything in the universe alone
 akelaa bhagwaan hi nirmaataa or sangrakshak he
 It is clear from Ubaidullah Sindhi's travels around the world that he had an international and world view
 yah unke jeevankaal ke vyavhaar or sangharsh se bhi spasht he ki vah chaahate the ki bharat angrejon dwaara shashan na kare
 He wanted India to be ruled by Indians
 1936 main, bhartiya rashtriya congress ne bharat lautne kaa anurodh kiya, or british raaj ne baad main isaki anumati di
 He landed at the port of Karachi from Saudi Arabia in 1938

 antarrashtriya raajnneeti main nirbharta kaa siddhanth yah he ki sansaadhan, nirdhan evam alpaviksit deshon se dhani deshon kii ore pravaahit hote hai or nirdhan deshon ko or garib karte hue dhani deshon ko or dhani banaate hai
 The principle of dependence is based on the fundamental belief that there is a deep connection between political and economic factors
 ye donon kaarak paraspar prabhavit karte hai tathaa kaaphi had tak aarthik karkon ke aadhaar par raajnneeti main mahatvapurn badlaav dekhne ko milte hai
 The theory of dependence has been fundamentally influenced by Marxism
 marxvad ke saath-saath hobasan va lenin ke samrajyavad kii avadharana ne ise or majboot bana diya he
 But since Marxists do not believe in the existence of 'state', it would be more logical to consider it as 'neo-marxist' concept
 vaise to yah avadharana antarrashtriya raajnneeti main 1950 ke dashak se vidyaman he, parantu 1970 ke dashak se zyada mahatvapurn ban gai he
 For the study of international politics of this period, more emphasis has been given on the relationship between political and economic elements
 is siddhanth ke mukhya samarthakon main paul baraan, paul swiji, heri madagaf, andri gunder phank, agrahiri emenual, samir amin, emenual walrusten aadi pramukh hai
 This theory became very important after the 1970s
 nimnlikhit kaarnon se is siddhanth kii charchaa par adhik bal diya jane laga- This theory is very difficult to define, because different authors have tried to explain it in different ways
 mukhya rup se vibhinn vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki - This principle can be divided into two parts to facilitate analysis - bahut se vidwaanon ne is siddhanth ko ‘kendra’ va ‘paridhi’ ke rashtron ke madhya hui aarthik va rajnatik antalakriyaaon ke rup main dekha he
 Originally, there is no significant difference in their thinking, but in view of more and less importance to a particular factor, they can be divided into three categories, which are described as follows - is varg ke agrani lekhak ke rup main raul prabisich kaa naam liya ja saktaa he jo sanyukt raashtra ke dakshini america aarthik ayog ke adhyaksh rahe
 Along with this, Furtado and Shankal can also be considered as belonging to this category
 is vichaar ke samarthak vidwaan antarrashtriya vyavastha ko kendra va paridhi ke rajyon main banta hua maanate hai
 According to him, due to traditional methods of production, much wealth has accumulated with the nations of the center
 isiilie un vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki vikaas va gaiyr vikaas yaa aviksit ko alag nahin kiya ja saktaa, balki ye donon ek hi sikke ke do pahalu hai
 In addition, neither can today be distinguished between internal and external factors, but rather both are interconnected
 isiilie latin america deshon ke aadharbhoot audyogic vikaas ke baad hi unako aupniveshik va samrajyavaadee bandhanon se mukti mil sakati he
 But thinkers of this class have been criticized by both liberals and progressives
 udaarvaadiyon kaa kahana he ki ye vyapaar chakra ke aarthik vikaas prakriya par padane vaale prabhaav kaa adhyayan nahin karte
 While progressive scholars have alleged that the people associated with the structural school have been unable to properly and properly study exploitation
 iske atirikt, ye vidwaan is baat ko bhi najar andaaj kar dete hai ki paridhi vaale rashtron main vikaas kendra ke rashtron dwaara takneekon ke vishvikaran ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 Prominent among those associated with this opinion are Andrigundar Frank, Pal Baran, Samin Amin etc
 ye vidwaan vishwa vyavastha ko 'mahanagaron' va 'upgrahon' ke rup me vibhajit maanate hai
 Frank believes that there is always 'development of non-development' in states with 'satellites' through capitalism
 mahanagaron vaale raashtra apane atirikt puunji ke labhaansh se inhen or aviksit bana dete hai
 In states with satellites, 'development of underdevelopment' is only part of an entire historical process, in itself there is no independent activity
 isiilie jab-jab in upgrah vaale rashtron kaa mahanagaron vaale rashtron ke kamjor bandhan rahaa he inhone apni vikaas dar ko badhaayaa he tathaa jab jab ye unase adhik jude rahe hai yah prakriya vipareet rahi he
 That is why the development of backwardness in a nation can be studied in the capitalist system on the basis of posturing of that state
 iske atirikt, iskaa us samaaj main sthapit aarthik dhaanchon ke aadhaar par bhi moolyankan kiya ja saktaa he
 This view has also been criticized on two grounds - First, the availability of capital and capitalism are two different points, so they should not be considered one
 dwitiya, is siddhanth ke aadhaar par purna rup se yah sthapit nahin kiya ja saktaa ki vikaas se kis prakaar latin america deshon main pichhadepan kaa vikaas hua he
 The third category is of thinkers who consider the relationship of dependence and development as connected
 inamen se pramukh vichaarak hai - caradoson, phaleto va osvaldo shankal
 They believe that historically-structurally South American countries have undergone fundamental changes in terms of capital investment
 unka maananaa he ki puunji nivesh krishi yaa kaccha maal ke utpaada kii bajaay taiyarshuda maal main lagaaya gaya he tathaa iske jude sanyukt udhyamon main sthaneey va bahya poojineveshkon main sahyog rahaa he
 That is why dependency, capitalism domination and development have been a situation of establishing a stored domination in third world countries rather than contradictory
 isiilie upabhokta vastuon ke utpaada ko badha kar teesri duniya ke deshon ke shahari aabaadi kii aavashyaktaa kii purti bahya bahurashtriya companiyon dwaara kii gai he
 That is why the structural system of these societies has been scattered
 isiilie in bahurashtriya companiyon ne teesri duniya ke deshon main nirbharta se jude vikaas kii sthiti paidaa kar di he
 Although the thinkers of this class have given a new interpretation apart from a predetermined interpretation, the theory of the class could not be properly used as an original unit
 uparokt teenon virgon main vichaaron main kahin-kahin bhinnata bhi dekhne ko milti he tathaa paramparaagat marxvad se bhi kai sandarbhon main alag he
 But it is true that according to all these, the nations with 'periphery' still depend on metropolitan centers in terms of economic development
 isi kaaran se shaayad mahanagaron me 'vikaas kaa vikaas' tathaa paridhi rashtron main 'avikas kaa vikaas' ho rahaa he
 Another form of dependency theory has also been studied under the world-system theory
 yadhyapi kuch vichaarak in donon ko alag maanate hai, parantu donon kii mul manyataon main koi antar nahin he
 The difference is only about interpretation
 atah ise nirbharta ke hi ek rup ke antargat swikaarna zyada uchit he
 Emmanuel Wallersten, the pioneer of the world system theory, can be said to have detailed it in his book The Modern World System
 walrusten kaa maananaa he ki itihaas main do prakaar kii vishwa pranaliyaan pai jaati hai - ‘vishwa samrajya’ va ‘vishwa arthvyavastha’
 The main difference between the two is how decisions are made about the sharing of resources
 unka maananaa he ki ‘vishwa samrajya’ vyavastha main shakti kaa prayog 'paridhi rajyon' se 'kendra rajyon' kii ore sansadhano kaa bantwaaraa kiya jaataa he
 In contrast, the world economy system lacks a centralized political structure
 atah kanoon ke dwaara sansaadhan kaa bantwaaraa kiye jane kii bajaae bazaar ke madhyam se ise sampann kiya jaataa he
 Thus, although both methods are different with respect to the sharing of resources, the overall result of both is the same
 vah he paridhi vaale rashtron se kendriya rajyon kii ore sansadhano kaa hastantaran ho rahaa he
 According to Wallerstein, 'central nations' are characterized by - democratic governments, high wages, import of raw materials, export of finished goods, high capital investment, welfare services, etc
 thik iske vipareet 'paridhi vaale rashtron' kii visheshtaayen hai - gaiyr-prajatantrik sarkaar paddati, kachche maal kaa niryaat, taiyaar maal kii aayaat, nimnastareey vetan, kalyankari sevaaon kaa abhaav
 But Wallerstein is slightly different from the dependencyists
 ve kendra va paridhi ke ilaava rashtron kii ek tritiy shrenee 'sam paridhi' bhi maanate hai
