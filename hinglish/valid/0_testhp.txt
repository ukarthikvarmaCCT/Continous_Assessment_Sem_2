 His second poem is known as "theogri", whose main themes are the beginning of creation and the history of different generations of deities
 homer tathaa hesied greek puranic sahitya ke pariposhak maane jate hai or unke granthon se yah spasht he ki unani vichaar bahudevatvvaad se ek devadhikadev kii kalpana kii ore agrasar ho chalaa tha
 The eighth century BC is considered an era of political change in the history of Greece, with the decline of the state and the rise of democracy
 unaniyon ke liye yah gahan chintan kaa samay tha jiskaa prabhaav kavy sahitya main pratibimbit he
 It was under these conditions that a new poetical form emerged, named "elegy"
 aajkal "eliji" main ve kavitaayen abhihit kii jaati hai jo mritatmaon ke shok se sambandhit ho athwa jinamein jivan kii kshanbhangurta athwa ateet vaibhav kii nashvarata par bhavpurn prakaash daalaa gaya ho
 But in ancient Greece in addition to this, other topical themes were included in the Elegies, in such poems the poet's personal expressions were sung on festive occasions such as war, love, politics and philosophical sermons in front of the audience with the rhythm of the flute
 in kaviyon kii style mahakavyon se prabhavit hote hue bhi unase bhinn thi
 Homer's hexagonal verse was pentennial in them, and such lines were folded into verses of various forms
 isi se milti julati ivik kavitaayen thi jinamein vyangy kaa gaharaa put hota tha
 Notable names in this poem are Archilochus, Solan, Theogna and Simonydiz
 atmabhivyanjan kaa swatantra tathaa shuddh rup geetikavyon main paaya jaataa he
 In ancient Greece, such poems were sung with the veena
 shuddh geetikavy yunaan main "iolian" bhashaa kii dein thi or iskaa mukhya centre "lesbaj" tha jahaan isa purv saatvin shatabdi main kaaphi raajnneetik tanaav tathaa sangharsh chalaa tha
 This aspect of public life is reflected in the songs of Alkyas
 parantu is kshetra kii mukhya nayika hai saafee, jinke geetikavy pragadh prembhav se otprot hai
 His poems are of love letters sent to Sakhis
 bhashaa, bhav tathaa sangeet kaa aisa sukhad samanvay anyatra durlabh he
 The poetess of Aflatun herself had sung in his memory - almost all the works of Saafi are fragmented
 adhiktar ye mistra kii balukabhumi se praapt hui
 The Syrian Greeks developed a lyrical narrative after the 12th century BCE whose significance was public and were sung in a trained chorus form on the sacred conquests and religious occasions of the country and nation or city
 inamen prasiddh "kores od" hai, jahaan chhandon kii jatilta, style kaa oj tathaa bhaavon kii garima sundar triveni kaa sanchaaran karti hai
 The most well-known name in this area is Pindar, whose "aad", embellished with impressive and distinguished but extraordinary terminology, is still alive today
 inhen ke saath simonidij kaa naam bhi liya jaataa he, jinaki kavitaaon main rashtriya ekta tathaa deshprem kaa gaharaa put he or bhashaa tathaa style kalatmak hote hue bhi apekshaakrit saral tathaa bodhgamy hai
 The climax of Greek literature is found in plays whose center was Athens and the main language was "etik"
 greek naatak saarvajaneen jivan se sambandhit rahe or unamem mukhya bhaavana tathaa prerana dharmik thi
 The Greek grief originated with the kirtans and amodes held in honor of Dionysus, the god of Sura, in which priests roamed while singing with a goat's face
 in geeton ko "ditharaev" kehete the
 This later took the form of drama when the religious chorus was divided into two parts - the messenger of the deity on one side and his priest on the other
 yahi doot naatak kaa pratham paatr mana jaataa he
 By the beginning of the fifth century BC, the form of Greek drama had become well-formed and the three main pillars of the grief drama, the Ischilas, the Safocleys and the Europeans, tried to develop it during this period
 iskilas greek du:khant naatak ke pita maane jate hai
 He was a soldier poet, and his plays are accompanied by an oozing style of imagination and high patriotism and unwavering religious faith
 pradhanta kavyapaksh kii he or naatakeey tatv gaun he
 His plays related to Aristees and Primethys are particularly famous
 greek du:khant ke vikaas main kendriya sthaan iskilas ke safal pratidwandvi sifoklis kaa he, jinhone tisare paatr kaa samavesh kar naatakeey tatwon, visheshkar samvaad kaa dayera vistrut kiya
 His plays have an artistic harmony with human and supernatural elements, and his characters, such as Oedipus and Etigon, are, despite their extraordinary personality, full of human characteristics
 vaataavaran ucch vichaaron se prerit he
 The decline of ancient beliefs and the rise of modern attitudes are clearly mentioned in the plays of Euripidies
 dharmik shraddha ke sthaan par naastikta, adarshavaad ke sthaan par yatharthwaad, asaadhaaran paatro ke sthaan par saadhaaran paatr pathakon ke samaksh aate hai
 He was a foster of Karunaras and his dialogues consist of complex arguments
 aisa mana jaataa he ki is ardhshatabdi ke alpakaal main iskilas ne 70, sofoklis ne 113 or urapidij ne 92 naatakon kaa nirmaan kiya jinamein adhikansh lupt ho gaye
 The Greek joyous drama also originated with the worship of the god Dionysus, but this worship was not held in the winter but in the spring, and the procession of priests displayed the same arrogance and vulgarity as often seen on the occasion of Holi in India
 Comes in sukhaant naatak ke vikaas main dirian logon kaa mahatvapurn yoga rahaa, parantu iskaa utkarsh to etika se hi sambandhit he kyonki pracheen greek sukhaant naatak ke prabal pravartak aristophanij kaa kaaryakshetra to athens hi rahaa
 This fearless playwright created such melodious plays from 427 BCE to 40 years in which there are astonishing combination of the flight of free imagination with the melody of poetry, the intensity of inspection and the ingenuity of satire
 in sukhantaan main, "pakshi", "bhek", "megh", "raaten" or praaia: vyaktiyon par prahaar kiya gaya he
 Many of these include the intense derision of Socrates and his disciples' political and justice-related narratives, the politics of the perikalese, and his concubine, Aspagia
 kai sthanon par hasyaras ashleelata se pankil ho uthaa he
 Ancient pleasant dramas culminated in the medieval happy dramas of Greece, in which, instead of barbarism and personal satire, there was encouragement to the graceful farce whose characters were often symbols of various human classes and errors
 is naveen evam sukhaant naatak ke sajiv udhaaharan "platas" tathaa "terence" ke roman naatakon main milte hai
 Minander was its famous Greek promoter
 in sukhaant naatakon main nimnakoti kaa vaasanatv pradhan he
 Greek prose originated behind the verse, just like other literatures of the world
 isa purv paanchavin shatabdi ke madhya main greek gadhy tathaa padya ke kshetra ek duusare se alag hone lage or bahut se vichaaron kaa abhivyanjan gadhy ke madhyam se hone laga
 Famous Greek historians, Herodotus, Thucydidies and Xenophon Greek philosophers such as Heraclitus, Aflatun and Aristotle, and Greek eloquents and philosophers were heavily involved in the creation of artistic prose
 shastriyon main mukhya sthaan sophistaan kaa tha jo athens main vaktaaon kaa prashikshan karte the or apane kavy tathaa sangitamay gadhybhashanon se asaty ke upar satya kaa mulammaa lagaakar logon ko mugdh kiya karte the
 Aflatun protested against his harmful effects, and after that Aristotle made a scientific interpretation of this scripture and threw light on different styles of prose that his explanation is considered authentic till date
 aflatoon tathaa unke shishy arestu darshanik hone ke saath hi sahityasameekshak bhi the
 The talent of both was versatile
 parantu plato kii gadhyshailee saahitiyik he or usamen yathasthaan kavitv kaa sundar put he arestu kaa gadhy neeras vaigyanik kaa he jisamen kalapaksh gaun he vichaarpaksh mukhya
 Review literature of Europe for centuries considered Aristotle's poetry as sacred as the Bible
 arestu ke shishy theophrestras apni gadhyrachana "kairactors" ke liye prasiddh hai
 In the early third century BCE, Greek literature began to move towards the end of the period
 sikandar ke pita philip dwitiya ne unani swatantra rashtron kii satta par kutharaghaat kiya or sikandar ne swayan apni vishwavijay kii ugantarkari yatra main unani sahitya tathaa samskruti ko saarvbhaum banane kaa sakriy prayaas kiya
 Thus some centers were built outside Greece where the study of Greek language and literature began to be conducted in a new way but with great enthusiasm
 in kendron main pramukh mishra kii rajdhani alekjandria thi jahaan par unani sahitya, darshan tathaa vigyaan ke hastlikhit granthon kaa ek vishaal pustkaalay ban gaya jiskaa vinaash isa purv pehali sadi main general antoni ke samay hua
 The authors and scholars of this new center were influenced and inspired by the writers of Greece and their work was especially appreciated in the field of science
 parantu sahitya kshetra main srujanaatmak pratibha kaa sthaan aalochana tathaa vyakaran or vyakhya sahitya ne le liya
 As a result, along with the interpretation of old literature, it became possible to preserve the characteristics of many texts
 is kaal kii kavita main naveen tatwon kaa vikaas spasht he parantu use saath hi yah bhi prakat he ki kavita kaa dayera sankuchit ho gaya or kavita janata ke liye nahin visheshgyon ke liye likhi jane lagi
 The style became artificial and cumbersome, and in word-of-mouth also stood the boast of erudition
 kaviyon main mukhya naam he theocretas kaa jo dehati jivan sambandhi gochaaran sahitya ke strashta maane jate hai or apolonius tathaa kalimax kaa vishesh sambandh kramash: mahakavy or footkar geetkavy, jaise "eliji" or "evigraamon" se he
 Around the second century BCE, the Roman invaders came to dominate the country of Greece, but they accepted the importance of Greek literature and philosophy, and decided to be inspired by them to flourish their national literature
 yahi kaaran he ki roman samrajya ke vividh bhaagon main unani bhashaa kaa prachaar tha or isi bhashaa ke madhyam se sahitya ke vibhinn kshetron main prasiddh granthon kaa nirmaan ho rahaa tha
 The main place in this literature is prose which is the review
 samikshakon main sarvshereshth "lanzinus" he jiskaa prasiddh kintu apurna granth "shaleen ke vishay main" pracheen samiksha sahitya main aflatoon tathaa arestu ke granthon kaa samakaksh mana jaataa he
 This book discusses the decency of literature and mentions hundreds of works of Greece and Rome as examples
 sameekshak kaa sahitya prempragadh he or gadhy style main kavyachamatkaar tathaa ospurn shabdavinyason kii bharmaar he
 Another famous and influential prose writer of this period is Plutarch, who was born in the high clan of Baytia and gained considerable fame by living in Rome
 kanya kii akaal mrityu se prerit ho inhone "consolation" kii rachana kii jo kalantar main lokapriy hui
 Plutarch was a famous philosopher and a devotee of "apollo" and the last phase of his life was spent in literary service and devarchan
 inke lekhon tathaa bhaashanon kaa sangrah "morelia" ke naam se prasiddh he
 Plutarch's best and most eminent treatise is a parallel character of the Greeks and Romans, in which he proves his claim that parallel examples of each Roman are available in Greek history
 yah rachana sansar ke prasiddh granthon main gini jaati he or isamen aitihaasik tatv gaun hote hue bhi mahatvapurn he, parantu usase adhik mahatvapurn he charitrachitran tathaa rochak kahani kii vah kala jisane ise apane kshetra kaa amuly ratna bana diya he
 In this era, Greek prose literature created certain novels which are known as romance because their main aim is not to present the real form of life and the reality has died down by imagination and exaggeration and surprising events
 in romance kritiyon main jaise "tir kaa apolonius", dafnes tathaa clon yaa pastoralia-prem tathaa asaadhaaran ghatnachakra hi centresthal he
 Primody of the hero and heroine, then their separation and then wandering from there to the hurt of circumstances, finally reuniting and attaining unity in love is basically the essence of the main plot of these texts
 is yug kii greek kavita main moulikta tathaa sajivta kaa abhaas he or adhikansh kavyasevi saadhaaran shrenee ke hai
 But the mention of Lucian E
 will be of importance in this direction
 greek kavy main nae jivan kaa usne sanchaar kiya
 Lucian was born in Syria and Greek was not his mother tongue, but he studied the language with such love and dedication that it became his mother tongue
 isaki vishesh rujhaan darshan kii ore thi jisase prerit hokar usne apane jivan ke sunahale kaal 40 varsh kii avasthaa main athens ko kuch samay ke liye apana nivasasthaan banaaya tha
 But the philosophers' seriousness was against his temperamental fickleness, as a result of which he activated his writings in the rebuttal of contemporary philosophical fetters
 uski rachanaaon main "faloris" tathaa "mritkon kaa dialaag" vishesh ullekhneey hai
 The dialogue is full of satirical pictures and presents commentary on the bizarre exploits of mankind and provides a good life tableau of the descendants of hell
 in sabhi rachanaaon main dhanikon ke vyavhaar tathaa vicharon ke prati lekhak kii ghrinaa tathaa kadi aalochana swat: pramaan he
 Thus Lucian's genius was inspired by satirical bitterness and his satire was not limited to contemporary life
 unhone pracheen tathaa samakaleen sabhi dharmik andolanon kii kadi aalochana kii ore devataaon ke dialags tathaa seriyak devi ke prati jaisi rachanaaon main devataaon tathaa unke chamatkaaron kii bhi kaaphi khilli udayi
 In this way, Lucian was not only representative of the old trend of Greece but was representative of all its literature
 lesian ke saath hi clasical greek bhashaa kaa avsaan ho jaataa he or ek mishrit bhashaa uskaa sthaan grahan karnaa aarambh karti he kyonki uski mukhya prerana kaa kshetra hi badal jaataa he
 Along with Christianity, a new inspiration came into being in the Greek language
 greek carch tathaa uske aadhin bahari kendron ke netaaon tathaa santon ne isi bhashaa ke madhyam se dharmik tathaa aadhyatmik samasyaon tathaa bhaawanaaon kaa vivechan tathaa vishleshan karnaa aarambh kiya
 Some of the religious works are explanatory and didactic, such as "the Famous Papers of Sant Pal" and some are related to order and organization, such as "first Epsil of Clement", but are mostly explanatory, such as "epsil of Barnavas"
 in rachanaaon main sahitya tatv gaun hai, parantu alekjandria ke prasiddh carch-pita klement tathaa origen ke gambhir lekh vichaargarima ke saath hi saath saahitiyik style ke bhi prabhaavshaalee udhaaharan hai
 Historically the most famous book is "ecclesiastical History" written by Czera, which is the authentic text of the then church history
 madhyayugin isai lekhakon ne greek bhashaa tathaa style ke madhyam se pracheen unani darshan tathaa dharm sambandhi mul tatwon kaa saamanjasy apane nae tathaa pragatisheel dharm se sthapit karne kaa kram aarambh kiya
 As a result, many elements of the old style were reborn and the main doctrines of Aflatun and Aristotle found a respectable place in Christian theology
 is nai vichaardhaara ke prabal samarthak "bizantium" ke dharmik lekhak the jo greek sahitya tathaa darshan se purnataya anupranit the
 The same religious center encouraged songs that were sung on various occasions of worship and festivals in the church and are still known as "liturgi" and "snow"
 ye geetkavy puraani chhandaparampara ko chhodkar ek nai chand pranali kaa anusaran karte hai or inke bahm roopon main ascharyajanak bhinnata he
 But the language is so flexible that it becomes an appropriate tool for all those different forms without any special effort

 Such poems have been written for centuries and words and music are often interwoven in them

 in lokapriy granthon kaa udgam sthaan mistra ke sat aathani kii "jeevanakatha" he jiske lekhak chauthi shatabdi ke sant athnasius maane jate hai
 The most popular parts of modern Greek literature are poetry, articles and poetry which were written in the common language
 vah bhashaa jo clasical ke vipareet "demotic greek" ke naam se prasiddh he
 Most of them fall under the category of folklore and are reflections of the ups and downs of folklore
 in geeton kii mukhya prerana loukik he or inke padhane se maharani elizabeth pratham ke swarnyug main prachlit un geetikavyon kaa samaran ho aata he jinamein javaani kii umang, prakrutiprem tathaa sura sundari main utkar lipsaa ke saath hi madhur pidaa bhi he jo bhautik sukh saundarya kii kshanbhangurta se aavirbhoot hoti he
 There are also some poems in this tradition whose importance is historical and the originals of the then accidents; For example, we can take those folk songs that mourn the downfall of Kustuntunia and express satisfaction over the courage and bravery of its defenders
 is prachur kavyasahitya ke saath lekhakon kaa vyaktigat sambandh nahin ke baraabar he

 The government killed Guru Tegh Bahadur, because he had gone to appeal to the government after seeing the sufferings of the Hindu Brahmins
 uske baad sarkari ahalakaaron ne gurmat ke badhate prachaar va anuyaayiyon kii baari sankhya ko apane dharm ke liye khatra samajhnaa shuru kar diya or wo iske viruddh ekajute ho gaye
 Meanwhile Guru Gobind Singh composed some banis which had strict comments against Islam
 uparokt paristhitayon tathaa aurangzeb or uske numaayindon ke gaiyr-muslim janata ke prati atyaachaari vyavhaar ko dekhte hue dharm kii raksha hetu jab guru gobind singh ne sashastr sangharsh kaa nirnay liya to unhone aise sikhon kii talash kii jo gurmat vichaardhaara ko aage badhaaen, dukhiyon kii madad karen or zaroorat padhne par apana balidaan dene main bhi peeche naa haten| When a religion progresses, it is very common to see that its followers are many, most of them are seen, some are in the shadows, some are due to their own self-will, the real followers are counted only as they are Huh
 is baat kaa pramaan anandpur main mila
 When Satgur Gobind Singh came out with a sword and said, "he needs a head"
 All of them were stunned
 Some slip away from the spot
 The Guru started going mad
 Some came to watch the spectacle
 Some mata ran to Gujri to see what Khumdi is cooking
 10 hazaar kii bheed main se pehla haath bhai dayaa singh ji kaa tha | gurmat vichaardhaara ke peeche voh sir katwane kii shamata rakhata tha | guru sahib usko tamboo main le gaye | vahaan ek bakre kii gardan kaati | khun tamboo se bahar nikalataa dikhaai diya | janata main dar or bad gaya | tab bhi himat dikhaa kar dharm singh, himmat singh, mohakam singh, sahib singh ne apana sis katwanaa sweekaar kiya | guru sahib bakre jhatakate rahe | The five then got out of the tent and made the pahul of khande bate
 khanda bata, jantra mantra or tantra ke smel se bana he
 It was first built by Satgur Gobind Singh
 is vidhi se hua tayar jal ko "pahul" kehete hai
 In common language, it is also called Amrit
 is ko pi kar sikh, khalsa fuj, kaa hisa ban jaataa he arthath ab usne tan man dhan sab parameshwar ko saunp diya he, ab wo sirf sach kaa prachaar karegaa or zarurat padhne par wo apana galaa kataane se peeche nahin hatega
 Will stay away from all vices
 aise sikh ko amritadhari bhi kaha jaataa he
 This Pahul was fed to all five and got them from the title of five loves
 2 kakkar to sikh dharm main pehle se hi the
 Where Sikhs understood spiritually even on all things, Satgur Gobind Singh ji separated the Khalsa in the physical look by giving them comb, kadha and kacha along with those two kakars
 aaj khande bate kii pahul paanch pyaare hi tayar karte hai
 This process has become a custom today
 aaj waisi pariksha nahin lee jaati jaisi us same lee gai thi
 This process is also called Amrit Sanchar
 itihaas is baat kaa gavaah he ki guru gobind singh ji bhi paanch pyaaron ke aadhin chalaa karte the or un ke hukum ko mana karte the
 The five loves ordered Gobind Singh to leave the fort of Chamkor and he had to obey
 paanch pyaaron ne phir gobind singh ji ko tokaa, jab gobind singh in kii parakh ke liye dadu kii kabr par namaskara kar rahe the
 Gobind Singh also sent Banda Bahadur with five loves, history mentions that when Banda Bahadur continued to violate the love, Banda Bahadur was all left in the fort
 gobind singh or khalsa fuj ne bahadur shah kii madad kii or use shaasha banane ke liye uske bhai se loha bhi liya
 It was Khalsa who discovered the bani of Guru Gobind Singh and molded it as a book

 hyperthyroidism yaa atigalagranthita vah shabd he jiskaa prayog galagranthi ke bheetar ke atisakriy utakon ke liye kiya jaataa he jisaki vajah se galagranthi hormone kaa aavashyaktaa se adhik utpaadan hone lagata he
 In this way, hyperthyroidism is a cause of thyrotoxicosis, ie the clinical condition of increased thyroid hormone in the blood
 yah gaur karne laayak baat he ki atigalagranthita or thyrotoxicosis samanarthak nahin hai
 For example, thyrotoxicosis may be due to ingestion of its exogenous thyroid hormone or inflammation of the thyroid gland, due to which it begins to secrete its thyroid hormone stores
 The thyroid hormone is important at the cellular level, affecting almost every type of tissue in the body
 jab avatu granthi bahut adhik maatra main hormone banane lagata he to sharir, urja kaa upyog maatra se adhik karne lagata he
 This is called hyper thyroidism or hyperactivity of the intact girth
 yah beemaari kisi bhi aayu vaale vyaktiyon ko ho sakati he tathaapi mahila main purush ke anupaat main yah beemaari paanch se aath guna adhik he
 The thyroid gland is a small gland in the middle of a butterfly-shaped lower neck
 iskaa mul kaam hota he ki sharir ke upaapachay ko niyantrit kare
 To control metabolism, the thyroid makes hormones that tell the body's cells how much energy is to be used
 yadi avatugranthi sahi tareeke se kaam kare to santoshjanak dar par sharir ke upaapachay ke kaary ke liye aavashyak hormone kii sahi maatra bani rahegi
 As the hormone continues to be used, the thyroid continues to replace it
 avatugranthi, rakt kii dhara main hormone kii maatra ko pituitary granthi ko sanchalit karke niyantrit karata he
 When the pituitary gland, located in the middle of the skull under the brain, detects that the thyroid hormone is deficient or in excess, it adjusts its hormones and tells the thyroid what to do
 thyroid hormone sharir main sabhi prakriyaaon kii gati ke ek niyantrak ke rup main kaam karata he
 This speed is called metabolism
 yadi bahut zyada thyroid hormone ho, to sharir ke har kaary main teji aane lagati he
 It is therefore not surprising that some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism include nervousness, irritability, increased sweating, heart palpitations, trembling of hands, anxiety, sleepiness, thinning of skin, delicate hair, especially the upper arms and Weakness in the muscles of the thighs are included
 aant kii gadabadi bahut lagaataar hoti rah sakati he, lekin dast yaa diaria asaamaanya he
 Despite considerable hunger, sometimes excessive weight loss can occur, vomiting and, in women, menstrual bleeding may be mild and menstrual bleeding may often be reduced
 thyroid hormone koshikaon ke saamaanya kaary ke liye mahatvapurn he
 In addition, it exaggerates the metabolism and intensifies the effects of the sensory nervous system, it "accelerates" various physiological systems and causes symptoms of epinephrine overdose
 inamen dil kii tej dhadkan or dhakdhaki ke lakshan, haath ke kampan jaise tantrika tantra kampan or vyagrata ke lakshan, pachan tantra kii atisakriyata, vajan main adhik kami or rakt pareekshan dwaara vasa str main asaamaanya kami dikhaaya janaa shaamil hai
 Hyperthyroidism usually starts slowly

 If a person is trying to lose weight through dieting, then one may be happy to lose weight due to hyperthyroidism, which results in rapid weight loss, which causes other problems
 grevs rog main, jo atigalagranthita kaa sabase aam rup yaa kaaran he, upree palak ke ooncha ho jane se ankhen badi lag sakati hai
 Occasionally, one or both eyes bulge out

 Graves' disease, especially due to hyperthyroidism, may occur in the family; a family member's investigation can also reveal thyroid problems in other members
 duusari ore, kaaryshil thyroid utakon main kami ke parinamswaroop thyroid hormone main lakshanatmak kami aati he, jise hypothyridism kaha jaataa he
 Hyperthyroidism often eventually results in hypothyroidism
 bade naidanik lakshanon main vajan ghatana, chintaa, garmi ke prati asahansheeltaa, bal kaa jhaadna, mansapeshiyon main dard, kamajori, thakaan, atisakriyata, chidchidapan, alpasharkrarktata, udaseenta, bahumootrata, atipipasa, pralaap, kampan, pritebial mixidima or pasinaa shaamil hai
 In addition, patients may experience a variety of symptoms, such as palpitations and arrhythmias, dyspnea, decreased libido, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
 Long-term untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to osteoporosis
 ye shastreey lakshan bujurgon main aksar maujuud nahin bhi ho sakate
 Neurological manifestations may include tremor, chills, myopathy, and periodic paralysis in some susceptible individuals
 thyroid rog or sahaj peshi durbalata ke bich ek sambandh paaya gaya he
 In this condition, thyroid disease is autophagy by nature and hyperthyroidism is also found in about 5% of patients with spontaneous muscular weakness
 thyroid ke ilaaj ke baad sahaj peshi durbalata main bahut hi kam maamalon main sudhaar hota he or in donon ke bich ke sambandh ko thik se nahin samajha ja sakaa he
 Some very rare neurological manifestations that are suspected to be associated with thyrotoxicosis are pseudotumor cerebri or cerebral, myocardial lateral sclerosis and gulien-about-like syndrome

 atirikt-drushti sambandhi kamajoriyaan duhari drushti ke saath maujuud ho sakati hai
 In the retarded eyelid, the eyelid fails to follow the downward moving or bending pupils when the patient is following the object downwards with its eye, and the same type of performance in the upward eyelid is also observed in eyelid regression
 Let's say, temporarily
 These symptoms or signs disappear with the treatment of hyperthyroidism
 drushti sambandhi in kisi bhi lakshan yaa sanketon ko exonthalmos ke saath bhram main nahin padana chahie, jo vishesh rup se or vilakshan dhang se grevs rog ke kaaran atigalagranthita main hota he

 Exophthalmos when present can cause hyperthyroid retardation and intensify gaze
 thyrotoxic sankat durlabh he lekin atigalagranthita kii ek gambhir samasya he, jo kisi thyrotoxic rogi ke bahut biimaar hone yaa shaareerik rup se atyadhik thakaa hone se ho sakati he
 Symptoms include: an increase in body temperature of more than 40 degrees Celsius, fasting, arrhythmia, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, coma and death
 Thyroid storm requires emergency treatment and hospitalization
 parisanchari thyroid hormone ke str ko kam karnaa or unke nirmaan main kami laana mukhya ilaaj he
 Propylthioracil and methimazole are two agents that decrease thyroid hormone synthesis and are usually given high doses
 thyroid granthi se thyroid hormone ke srav ko rokane ke liye sodium iodide, potacium iodide or / yaa lugol kaa ghol diya ja saktaa he
 Beta blockers such as propranolol can help control heart rate and intravenous steroids can be used to aid blood circulation
 is sadi ke prarambh main, thyroid tufaan se mrityu dar 100% tak pahunch chuki thi
 However, now, with the aggressive use of the therapy described above, thyroid storm mortality has reduced to less than 20%
 hyperthyrodism ke nimnlikhit lakshan he: If thyroid disease is caught early, it can be cured by treatment before symptoms appear
 avatugranthi jivan bhar rahata he
 With its careful management, people suffering from thyroid gland can live their life in a healthy and normal manner
 atigalagranthita ke kai kaaran hote hai
 Mostly, the entire gland over-produces thyroid hormone
 ise grevs rog kaha jaataa he
 Generally, in rare cases, a single gland is responsible for excess hormone secretion, which is called the "hot" gland
 thyroditis bhi atigalagranthita paidaa kar sakati he
 In many clinical conditions, excess thyroid hormone is produced by the functioning thyroid tissue
 manushyon main iske pramukh kaaran nimnlikhit hai: High blood levels of thyroid hormones can occur for many other reasons: rakt main shlashmik granthi dwaara utpaadit thyroid-uttejan hormone )) ke str ko maapna vishisht rup se sandigdh atigalagranthita kaa praarambhik pareekshan he
 a low level of TSH typically indicates that the mucosa is obstructed or "directed" by the brain to cut stimulation of the thyroid gland, leading to increased levels of T4 and / or T3 in the blood
 It seems to happen
 kabhi-kabhaar hi, ek nimna ti shlashmik kii praathmik vifaltaa, yaa anya beemaari ke kaaran shlashmik ke asthaayee avarodhan ko ingit karata he or isliye T4 or T3 kii jaanch tab bhi naidanik rup se upyogi he
 Measuring specific anti-thyroid-peroxidases such as anti-tsh-receptor antibodies in Graves' disease or per-thyroid-peroxidase in Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also contribute to the diagnosis
 rakt pareekshanon se atigalagranthita ke nidaan kii pushti hoti he, jo thyroid uttejan hormone str main kami or T4 tathaa T3 staron main vruddhi darshata he
 TSH is a hormone made by the mucous gland in the brain, which tells the thyroid gland how much hormone to make
 jab thyroid hormone bahut adhik hota he, tab ti kam ho jaataa he
 Both radioactive iodine ingestion tests and thyroid scans characterize the cause of hyperthyroidism or enable radiologists and doctors to determine the cause of hyperthyroidism
 thyroid granthi dwaara avashoshit iodine kii maatra ko maapne ke liye udgrahan pareekshan ke dauraan khaali pet radiodharmee iodine injection kaa upyog kiya jaataa he yaa munh ke dwaara sharir main daalaa jaataa he
 People suffering from hyperthyroidism consume too much iodine
 udgrahan pareekshan ke silsile main vishisht rup se sanchalit thyroid scan chhaviyaan prastut karata he, jisase granthi kii ati-kriyasheeltaa kii drishy jaanch ho paati he
 Thyroid scintigraphy is a useful test for characterization of this disease resulting from hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis
 yah pareekshan pranali main vishisht rup se ek duusare se jude do pareekshan shaamil hai: ek iodine udgrahan pareekshan or ek gamma camere ke saath ek scan 
 udgrahan pareekshan main radiodharmee iodine kii ek khuraaq, vishisht rup se iodine-123 yaa 123I, ko prabhaav main laana shaamil he, jo thyroid rog ke naidanik adhyayan ke liye iodine kaa sabase upyukt samasthanik he
 I-123 is almost the ideal isotopic of iodine to produce images of thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer mutation
 aamtaur par, sodium iodide yukt ek goli munh se nigal lee jaati he, jisamen iodine-123 kii choti maatra hoti he, jo sambhawatah namak ke ek dane se bhi kam hoti he
 It is usually necessary to stay on fast for two hours before swallowing the pill and for an hour thereafter
 aam taur par unke dwaara radioiodine kii yah kam khuraaq sahneeya hoti he jinamein anya rup se iodine se allergy he or isi tarah ke chhavi banane vaali naidanik pranaaliyon main istemaal hone vaale iodine kii badi khuraaqon se yukt pratikul madhyam ko sahan nahin kar sakate hai)
 thyroid granthi main avashoshit nahin ho sakane vaale atirikt radioiodine ko sharir mutr dwaara baahar nikaal detaa he
 Some patients may experience mild allergic reaction to clinical radioiodine and may be given antihistamines
 rogi aamtaur par 24 ghante baad radioiodine "udgrahan" kaa str waapas praapt kar letaa he, ise gale main bandhi ek dhaatu shalaka se jude upkaran se mapa jaataa he, jo thyroid se radiodharmita utsarjan ko maapta he
 This test takes 4 minutes, as long as the leverage by machine software is stored
 vishisht rup se, ek scan bhi kiya jaataa he, jahaan gamma camera se visham thyroid granthi kii chhaviyaan lee jaati hai; radiologist uskaa adhyayan karata he or chhaviyon kii jaanch karne ke baad udgrahan % kaa ullekh karte hue ek report taiyaar karata he or apni tippanee detaa he
 Hyperthyroid patients typically "ingest" a higher-than-normal level of radioiodine
 RAI udgrahan kaa saamaanya seemaa 10-30% se hai
 In addition to testing TSH levels, many doctors also test T3, Free T3, T4 and / or Free T4 for more detailed results
 in hormonon ke liye vishisht vayask simaaen hai: ti : 0
45 - 4
50 uiu / emel, T4 free / pratyaksh : 0
82 - 1
77 enji / decilitre; or T3 : 71 - 180 enji / decilitre
 atigalagranthita se grast vyakti aasaani se kai baar T4 or / yaa T3 kii in upree simaaon ko pradarshit kar sakate hai
 See the complete table of common range limits of thyroid function in the thyroid gland article
 hyperthirodism ke kaaran nimnlikhit hai- Large and commonly accepted modalities for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in humans include the initial temporary use of suppressive thyrostatics treatment and possibly later permanent surgery or radioisotopic therapy
 sakriy thyroid kaary ke tahat sabhi raste kaaran ho sakate hai, jinhen aasaani se levothairoxin anupuran se sambhala ja saktaa he
 Thyrosthetics drugs inhibit the production of thyroid hormones, such as carbimazole and methimazole and propylthurasil
 Thyrostatics is believed to inhibit the iodization of thyroglobulin by thyroperoxidase and thereby inhibit the formation of tetra-iodothyronine
 thyroid granthi ke baahar bhi propylathuresil kaam karata he, sakriy rup T3 main T4 ke roopantaran ko roktaa he
 Since thyroid tissue usually contains a large accumulation of thyroid hormones, it takes several weeks for thyrostatics to take effect and the dose often needs to be titrated over a period of months, as well as regular doctor care
 And blood tests have to be done to check the results
 praarambhik upachaar main praayah ek bahut hi ucch khuraaq kii jarurat hoti he, lekin agar lagaataar ek ucch khuraaq kaa istemaal kiya jaataa rahe to rogiyon main avatu-alpakriyata ke lakshan viksit ho sakate hai
 This titer of dose is difficult to perform correctly, and is why the "barrier and substitution" method is sometimes adopted
 baadha va pratisthaapan upachaar main thyroid hormone ko puri tarah se band karne ke liye paryaapt maatra main thyrostetics liye jate hai, marij kaa ilaaj is tarah kiya jaataa he jaise ki use puri avatu-alpakriyata he
 Many of the common symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, tremors, and anxiety, are mediated by an increase in beta adrenergic receptors on cell surfaces
 vishisht rup se ucch rakt chaap ke ilaaj main istemaal kiye jane vaale beta blowers is prakaar kii dawa he jo is prabhaav ko pratisantulit kar detii he, dhakdhaki ke samvedan se judi teevr dhadkan ko kam karti he or kampan tathaa vyagrata main kami laati he
 Thus, patients suffering from hyperthyroidism can often get immediate temporary relief, as long as the radioiodine test described above characterizes the hyperthyroidism and then more permanent treatment can begin
 dhyaan den ki ye dawaaen atigalagranthita yaa ilaaj nahin karaane kii vajah se iske dirghakaalik prabhaavon kaa koi ilaaj nahin karatin, balki ye keval sthiti ke lakshanon kaa ilaaj karti hai yaa unhen kam karti he
 Some minimal effects on thyroid hormone production, however, also come from propranolol — which has two roles in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, which is determined by the different isopropyl substances of propranolol
 el-propranolol beta-avarodhan kaa kaaran he, isliye kampan, dhakdhaki, vyagrata or garmi asahansheeltaa jaise atigalagranthita ke saath jude lakshanon kaa upachaar karata he
 D-propranolol inhibits thyroxine deiodinase, thus providing some, albeit minimal, effects by blocking the conversion of T4 into T3
 anya beta blowers kaa istemaal keval atigalagranthita ke saath jude lakshanon ke ilaaj ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Propranolol in the US and metoprolol in the UK are often used to enhance the treatment of hyperthyroid patients
 aakraamak radio samasthanik chikitsa ke kam upyog ke liye samay se pehle surgery ek vikalp he, lekin aise maamalon main tab bhi isaki jarurat padati he, jinamein thyroid granthi badi ho gayi ho or gardan kii banaavat par dabaav kaa kaaran ho, yaa atigalagranthita kaa aadharbhoot kaaran multah cancer-sambandhi ho
 Surgery is not widely used, as the most common forms of hyperthyroidism are most effectively treated by the radioactive iodine method, and as the removal of the parathyroid glands and cutting of the recurrent laryngeal nerve makes it difficult to swallow and cause a large Surgery may even lead to generalized staphylococcal infections
 kuch grevs rog ke marij, tathaapi, is yaa us kaaran se dawaaon ko bardaasht kar sakate hai, ve rogi jinhen iodine se allergy he, yaa jo rogi radioiodine se inkaar karte hai, ve shalya chikitsa kaa vikalp chun sakate hai
 In addition, some surgeons believe that radioiodine treatment is unsafe for patients with abnormally large glands, or whose eyes are out of the cotter; There are fears that too high a dose of radioiodine 131 may increase the patient's symptoms
 iodine-131 radio samasthanik chikitsa main, ati sakriy thyroid granthi ke kaary ko sakhti ke saath rokane yaa ekadam se nasht karne ke liye ek baar ke liye radiodharmee iodine-131 munh ke jariye diya jaataa he 
 apadan kaarak upachaar ke liye is radiodharmee iodine ke samasthanik kaa prayog naidanik radioiodine kii tulana main adhik shaktishaalee hota he, jiskaa jaivik arddh jivan 8-13 ghante hota he
 Iodine-131, which also eliminates beta particles that are far more harmful to tissues in a limited area, has a half-life of about 8 days
 jin rogiyon par pehali khuraaq kaa asar nahin hota, kabhi-kabhi unhen radio iodine kii atirikt, badi khuraaq di jaati he
 In this treatment, iodine-131 is taken up by the active cells in the thyroid and destroys them, making the thyroid gland mostly or completely inactive
 chunki thyroid koshikaon dwaara iodine ko badi saralata se uthaa liya jaataa he or ati-sakriy thyroid koshikaon dwaara or bhi adhik saralata se uthaaya jaataa he, so vinaash sthaneey str par hota he or is chikitsa ke vyapak dushprabhav nahin hote hai
 Radioiodine ablation has been in use for 50 years and the only major reason for not using it is pregnancy and breastfeeding
 Once the thyroid gland is made dormant, replacement hormone therapy can be easily given through the mouth daily to meet the body's requirement of thyroid hormone
 haalanki, ek visham adhyayan kii tippanee he ki atigalagranthita ke liye radioiodine ilaaj ke baad cancer kii ghatnaon main vruddhi dekhi gayi
 The major advantage of radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism is that it has a much higher success rate than drug therapy
 radioiodine kii khuraaq ke chayan or ilaaj kiye ja rahe rog par nirbhar, atigalagranthita ke nishchit samaadhaan kii safalataa dar 75-100% par bhinn ho sakati he
 One major potential side effect of radioiodine in Graves' patients is the development of subcutaneous hyperactivity, which requires daily thyroid hormone treatment
 kabhi-kabhi, kuch rogiyon ko ek se adhik radiodharmee upachaar kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he, yah rog ke prakaar, thyroid ke aakaar or di gayi praarambhik prashasit khuraaq par nirbhar he
 Many patients are saddened at first that they have to take thyroid hormone pill throughout their life
 Nevertheless, thyroid hormones are safe, cheap, and easy to swallow; And hormones are similar to the thyroid and are usually made by the thyroid itself; Generally, this therapy is extremely safe and very tolerable for most patients
 radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke parinamswaroop thyroid utak ke vinaash se, aksar kai dinon se lekar saptahon tak kii ek chalyman avadhi aati he jab radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke baad atigalagranthita ke lakshan vastav main or bighad sakate hai
 This is usually due to the release of thyroid hormone into the blood after radioactive iodine-generated destruction of thyroid cells containing thyroid hormones
 kuch rogiyon main, beta blowers jaise aushadhi upachaar is avadhi main upyogi ho sakate hai
 Many patients are able to tolerate the first few weeks without any problems
 aamtaur par ek choti si goli ke rup main die jane vaale radiodharmee iodine upachaar ke baad adhikansh rogiyon ne kisi bhi kathinaayee kaa anubhav nahin kiya
 Occasionally, a few days later, neck tenderness or throat inflammation may appear if a mild inflammation develops in the thyroid and is causing discomfort in the neck or throat area
 yah aamtaur par asthaayee hota he or yah bukhaar aadi ke saath sambhddha nahin he
 Women who breastfeed after radioactive iodine treatment should stop breastfeeding for at least one week, and possibly longer, because some amount of radioactive iodine is found in breast milk even after several weeks of radioactive iodine treatment
 Can
 radioiodine ke baad ek aam parinaam hota he atigalagranthita arthath avatu-atikriyata se aasaani se upachaaryogy avatu-alpakriyata main ek badlaav or yah grevs thyrotoxicosis kaa ilaaj kara rahe 78% main tathaa vishakt bahuparvil galgand yaa akele vifaille granthi-arbud kaa ilaaj kara rahe 40% hota he
 The use of large doses of radioiodine reduces the incidence of treatment failure, mostly as a result of high response rates to treatment, resulting in high rates of suboptimal activity that have to be treated throughout the life of the hormone
 ultrasound scan main thyroid main radioiodine chikitsa se adhik ekarup se samvedansheeltaa main vruddhi dekhi gayi, aisa khachaakhach bhare badi koshikaon ke kaaran hota he, jo baad main 81% hypothyroid main badal jaati hai, jo saamaanya scan prakaton waalon kii tulana main 37% adhik hoti hai
 Thyroid storm is present with extreme symptoms of hyperthyroidism
 iskaa ilaaj aakraamakata ke saath kiya jaataa he, uparyukt sanyojanon sahit punerjeevan upayon ke saath, jiname shaamil hai: methimajol jaise ek theonamide, ke baad propranolol jaise shirabhyantar beta blowers, ek iodinated radiocontrast agent yaa agar radiocontrast agent uplabdh nahin ho to iodine ghol or ek shirabhyantar steroid hydrocartizone
 In veterinary medicine, hyperthyroidism is one of the most common endocrine conditions affecting older domesticated cats
 kuch pashu chikitsakon ke anusaar 10 saal kii umr se adhik kii billiyon main se 2% tak ko yah hota he
 The disease became significantly more common since the first reports on hyperthyroidism of cats in the 1970s
 billiyon main, atigalagranthita kaa ek kaaran saumy arbud lagata he, lekin un billiyon main aise arbud viksit hone ke kaaran ko jaanane ke liye shodh jari he
 However, a recent research article published in Environmental Science and Technology, a publication of the American Chemical Society, states that the unveiling of environmental contaminants called polybrominated diphenyl ethers) has been linked to numerous cases of cats' hyperthyroidism; These contaminants are present in fire retardants in many household products, especially in furniture and some electronic goods
 EPA ke nashnal health and enwyremental effects laboratory or indiana vishvavidhyalay ke shodhakartaaon dwaara sanyukt rup se yojit adhyayan par yah report aadhaarit he
 In the study, 23 domesticated cats with hyperthyroidism were included, with three times higher PDBE blood levels than those of younger and non-hyperthyroidized cats

 beemaari ke rogajanan main kai anya kaarak bhoomika nibhaa sakate hai, jaise ki galgandjunk or iodine or aahaar main selenium tatv
 The most common manifesting symptoms are: rapid weight loss, rapid heartbeat rate, vomiting, diarrhea, hyperpigmentation and increased food intake, and increased urine output
 Other symptoms include hyperactivity, potential aggression, heart murmur, gallop rhythm, frayed form and large and thick nails
 Approximately 70% of afflicted cats have enlarged thyroid glands
 billiyon kii atigalagranthita main bhi upachaar ke vahi teen vikalp hai jo manushyon ke liye istemaal hote hai 
 billiyon ko unke baaqi bache jivan ke liye dawa zarur di jaani chahie, lekin khaskar bahut budhi billiyon ko kam mahangaa vikalp diya ja saktaa he
 Radioiodine treatments and surgery often correct hyperthyroidism
 kuch pashu chikitsak shalya chikitsa ke bajaay radio iodine ilaaj ko praathamikta dete hai, kyonki isamen sangyaaharan se judaa jokhim nahin he
 However, radioiodine treatment for cats is not available in all areas
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki is ilaaj ke liye parmaanu radiodharmee visheshgyata or suvidhaon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, chunki radiodharmee upachaar ke baad anek dinon tak jaanwaron ke mutr, pasinaa, laar or mel radiodharmee rahete hai, so aam taur par kul teen saptaah ke liye unhen antarang rogi kii tarah aspataal main rakhana jaruri hota he or uski suvidhaon kii jarurat hoti he

 Galileo Galilei was a scientist from Italy
 ve ek mahaan avishkaarak the tathaa doordarshee ke vikaas main unka athulaneey sahyog tha
 This great thinker was born into a musician family in the city of Pisa, modern Italy
 aadhunik italy kaa shahar pisa 15 farvari 1564 ke mahaan vaigyanik galileo gallily ke janm ko bhi ishwar kii rachana kaa dosha maanakar aitihaasik bhul kar baitha tha
 The doctrines propounded by Galileo contradicted religious beliefs, for which Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment for trespassing with divine beliefs
 inke pita vincounjo gallily us samay ke jane maane sangeet visheshgy the
 He used to play an instrument called "lute", the same instrument called lute which later evolved into guitar and banjo
 apni sangeet rachana ke dauraan vincounjo gallily ne tani huyi dori yaa taar ke tanaav or usase nikalne vaale swaron kaa gahanta se adhyayan kiya tathaa yah paaya ki dori yaa taar ke tanaav or usase nikalne vaali aawaaj main sambandh he
 The scientific study of the results of the interrelations of the sounds of the string, or the string, stretched for the music by the father, was done by his son Galileo
 is adhyayan ko karne ke dauraan balak galileo ke man main sugrahita purna prayog karte huye unke parinamo ko aatmsaat karne kii prerana pradaan kii
 He is considered the father of exam oriented science
 inhone dolan kaa sutara kaa pratipaadan kiya
 He invented binoculars
 usne doordarshee yantra ko adhik unnat banaaya
 With his help, he took many astronomical observations and supported the theory of Copernicus
 unhen aadhunik praayogic khagoliki kaa janak mana jaataa he
 He found that the laws of nature are influenced by each other's factors and there is a relation between the increase and decrease of one as in the equations of mathematics
 isaliye unhone kaha kih-‘ ishwar kii bhashaa ganit he
 'this great mathematician and scientist only dared to measure the speed of light
 iske liye galileo or unka ek sahaayak andheri raat main kai mile dur sthit do pahaad kii chotiyon par ja baithe
 From where Galileo lit the lantern, after getting his assistant's signal, they were to indicate the light through the lantern and its knock
 duusari pahari par sthit unke sahaayak ko laalaten kaa prakaash dekhakar apane paas rakhi duusari laalaten kaa khatka hataakar punah sanket karnaa tha
 Thus Galileo had to estimate the speed of light by looking at the light shining on the top of the second mountain
 is prakaar galileo ne jo parinaam paaya vah bahut seemaa tak vaastavik to na tha parantu prayogon kii aavruti or safalataa asafalataa ke baad hi abhisht parinaam paane kii jo muhim unke dwaara prarambh kii gayi vah adwitiya thi
 In due course, Albert Einstein, the great scientist who solved the intricate relationship between the speed of light and the relationship of energy, referred to him as 'father of modern science'
 galileo dharmik pravruth ke the parantu puraani dharmik manyataon ko vivekshiltaa or prayog ke madhyam se sidv karnaa chaahate the
 In the year 1609, Galileo discovered a telescope that was invented in Holland, with the help of this telescope, one could study their motion by looking at distant celestial bodies
 galileo ne iskaa vivaran sunakar swayan aisi doorabeen kaa nirmaan kar daalaa jo holland main avishkrut doorabeen se kahin adhik shaktishaalee thi
 Based on this, through his observations and experiments, Galileo found that all the planets, including Earth, revolve around the Sun, contrary to the prevailing beliefs in the universe
 isse purv copernicus ne bhi yah kaha tha ki prithvi samet sabhi grah surya kii parikrama karte he jiske liye unhe carch kaa kopbhaajan bananaa padaa tha
 Now, based on the results based on experimentation and discretion, Galilea found it to be the same
 us samay tak yah sarvamaanya sidwant tha ki brahmand ke kendra main prithvi sthit he tathaa surya or chandramaa sahit sabhi akashiya pind lagaataar prithvi kii parikrama karte he
 This recognition was supported by the religious leaders of Tadsamay
 apane prayogon ke aadhaar par praapt parinaamon ke kaaran galileo ne puraani avadharanaon ke virudv khadey hone kaa nirnay liya
 When Galileo made this doctrine public, the Church considered it his disobedience and for this disobedience Galileo was sentenced to imprisonment on behalf of the Church
 galileo ke dwaara diye gayi vichaar ne tadsamay manushya ke chintan kii disha ke naye rup main swikaarne ko vivash kar diya
 Due to social and religious persecution, he could not stand for long with the theories, contrary to the prevailing beliefs and beliefs
 varsh 1633 main 69 varshiya vrudv galileo ko carch kii ore se yah aadesh diya gaya ki ve saarvajanik taur par maafee maangate huye yah kahen ki dharmik manyataon ke virudv diye gayi unke sidwant unke jivan kii sabase bady bhul thi jiske liye ve sharminda hai
 He did the same, but even after this he was imprisoned
 unka swasthya lagaataar bigadta rahaa or isi ke chalate karawas kii sajaa grih-kaid arthath apane hi ghar main kaid main rahane kii sajaa main badal diya gaya
 He also spent the last day of his life in this prison

 Thus, it took more than three and a half years for the Church to accept its historical error by ordering a 1633 order regarding Galileo, a great astronomer, mathematician, physicist and philosopher
 varsh 1609 main doorabeen ke nirmaan or khagoleey pindon ke prekshan kii ghatana ke chaar sau saalon ke baad 400veen jayanti ke rup main varsh 2009 ko antarrashtriya khagoliki varsh ke rup main manaakar is mahaan vaigyanik ko shradwanjali arpit kar apni bhul kaa praashchitya karne kaa prayaas kiya
 The floodplains in northeastern India around Doar or Dooar Bhutan are the foothills of the eastern Himalayas

 vaidic dharmapar ek shrenee kaa bhaag Salvation dhyaan yoga The sermon that Shri Krishna preached to Arjuna in the battlefield of Kuru region is known as Srimad Bhagavadgita
 yah mahabharat ke bhishmaparv kaa ang he
 The Gita has 18 chapters and 720 verses
 jaisaa gita ke shankar bhashya main kaha he- tan dharman bhagawata yathopadisht vedavyas: sarvagyobhagavan gitakhyai: saptabhi: shlokashatairu panibandh
 It is known that in the early 20th century, in front of Geeta Press Gorakhpur, there was the same text of Geeta which is available to us today
 20veen sadi ke lagbhag bhishmaparv kaa java kii bhashaa main ek anuwaad hua tha
 Many basics are also safe in it
 shripad krishna belwelkar ke anusaar java ke is pracheen sanskaran main gita ke keval saadhe ikyasi shloke mul sanskrit ke hai
 They also support the current text
 gita kii gananaa prasthaantrayee main kii jaati he, jisamen upanishad or brahmasutra bhi sanmilit hai
 Therefore, according to Indian tradition, the place of Gita is the same as that of Upanishads and Brahmasutras
 gita ke mahatmaya main upanishdon ko gau or gita ko uskaa dugdh kaha gaya he
 This means that the Gita accepts the spirituality of the Upanishads in the Sarvansh
 upanishdon kii anek vidyaayein gita main hai
 For example, Ashwattha lore in relation to the nature of the world, Avyayamusha lore in the context of eternal Ajna Brahma, Aksha Purushu vidha in the matter of Para Prakriti or Jiva, and Ksharapurushu Vidya concerning Apara Prakriti or material world
 is prakaar vedon ke brahmavaad or upanishdon ke aadhyatm, in donon kii vishisht saamagree gita main sannivisht he
 In the words of Pushpika it is called theology
 gita main 'brahmavidya' kaa aashay nivrittiparak gyanmarg se he
 It is called Sankhyamat with which the Nivitvarigi Vibhagya is associated
 lekin gita upanishdon ke mode se aage badhkar us yug kii dein he, jab ek nayaa darshan janm le rahaa tha jo grihasthon ke pravriti dharm ko nivritti maarg ke samakaksh or utana hi faldaayak maanata tha
 The same signifies the word 'yogashastra' in the Pushpika of the Gita
 yahan ‘yogashastre’ kaa abhipraay ni:andeh karmyog se hi he
 Two definitions of yoga are found in the Gita
 ek nivritti maarg kii drushti se jisamen ‘samatvam yoga uchyate’ kaha gaya he arthath gunon ke vaishamy main samyabhav rakhana hi yoga he
 This is the position of Sankhya
 yoga kii duusari paribhaasha he ‘yoga: karmsu kaushalam’ arthath karmon main lage rahane par bhi aise upaay se karm karnaa ki vah bandhan kaa kaaran na ho or karm karanevaala usee asang yaa nirlep sthiti main apane ko rakh sake jo gyanamargiyon ko milti he
 The name of this device is Buddhayog and this is the essence of the Yoga of the Gita
 gita ke duusare adhyay main jo ‘tasya pragnapratishthita’ kii dhun pai jaati he, uskaa abhipraay nirlep karm kii kshamtavali buddhi se hi he
 This was not a situation of attaining renunciation by the renunciation of karma, but a plan to elevate the pre-existing mind to a state of disinterest while performing karma
 yahi gita kaa karmyog he
 Just as in many places in the Mahabharata, so is the interpretation and appreciation of the Sankhya path of Sankhya and the path of Karma
 ek kii ninda or duusare kii prashansa gita kaa abhimath nahin, donon maarg do prakaar kii ru chi rakhanevaale manushyon ke liye hitkar ho sakate hai or hai
 Probably no other book of the world renders the scripture of Karma with this beauty, this subtlety and objectivity
 is drushti se gita adbhut maanviya shaastra he
 Its vision is not one-sided, but all-round
 gita main darshan kaa pratipaadan karte hue bhi jo sahitya kaa anand he vah isaki atirikt visheshta he
 The description of the philosophy through cultured poetry is the personal grief of the Gita, which does not remain without enchanting any heart
 isiilie iskaa naam bhagavadgita padaa, bhagavan kaa gaaya hua gyaan
 The background of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita is the war of Mahabharata
 jis prakaar ek saamaanya manushya apane jivan kii samasyaon main ulajhakar kinkartavyavimudh ho jaataa he or uske pashchaat jivan ke samarangan se palaayan karne kaa man bana letaa he usee prakaar arjuna jo mahabharat kaa mahanayake he apane saamne aane vaali samasyaon se bhaybheet hokar jivan or kshatriya dharm se niraash ho gaya he, arjuna kii tarah hi ham sabhi kabhi-kabhi anishchay kii sthiti main yaa to hataash ho jate hai or yaa phir apni samasyaon se udign hokar kartavya vimukh ho jate hai
 The sages of India, after deep thought, imbibed the knowledge they gave to the Vedas
 inhen vedon kaa antim bhaag upanishad kehalaata he
 The characteristic of human life is the intellectual power acquired by human beings, and the knowledge contained in the Upanishads is not only the highest state of human intelligence but also gives a glimpse of what man can experience beyond the limits of intellect
 gita ke 18 adhyyon main varnit vishyon kii bhi kramprapt sangati he
 The name of the first chapter is Arjunvishad Yoga
 vah gita ke upadesh kaa vilakshan naatakeey rangamanch prastut karata he jisamen shrota or vaktaa donon hi kutuhal shanti ke liye nahin varan jivan kii pragadh samasya ke samaadhaan ke liye pravrutt hote hai
 Shaurya and patience, courage and strength made Arjuna's personality with the impressive amount of these four qualities and above all these four qualities were one and forgiveness, the other is wisdom
 balpradhan kshatradharm se praapt honevaali sthiti main pahunchakar sahasaa arjuna ke chitt par ek duusare hi prakaar ke manobhaav kaa akraman hua, carpanya kaa
 a strange kind of compassion filled his mind and his faint nature vanished
 jis kartavya ke liye vah katibaddh hua tha usase vah vimukh ho gaya
 On looking from above, his arguments in favor of this situation seem to be religious, but he himself has called it Karpanya Dosh and it is believed that due to this cuteness of mind, his natal nature was hurt or destroyed
 vah nirnay nahin kar paa rahaa tha ki yuddh kare athwa vairaygy le le
 What to do, what not to do, was not understood
 is manobhaav kii charam sthiti main pahunchakar usne dhanushbaan ek ore daal diya
 Krishna saw Arjuna's condition that Arjuna's body was fine but before the start of the war, the morale of that wonderful Kshatriya was broken
 bina man ke yah sharir khadaa nahin rah saktaa
 Therefore, a guru duty came in front of Krishna
 at: tark se, buddhi se, gyaan se, karm kii charchaa se, vishwa ke swabhaav se, usamen jivan kii sthiti se, donon ke niamak avyay purush ke parichay se or us sarvopari param sattavan brahm ke saakshaat darshan se arjuna ke man kaa uddhaar karnaa, yahi unka lakshya hua
 The subject of this discussion is the Gita
 pehle adhyay main saamaanya reeti se bhoomika rup main arjuna ne bhagwaan se apni sthiti kah di
 The second chapter is named Sankhyayoga
 isamen jivan kii do pracheen sanmanit paramparaon kaa tarkon dwaara varnan aayaa he
 Seeing Arjuna weeping in that sorrowful condition, Krishna has brought to his attention that this type of claviness and petty infirmity of heart is not suitable for a hero like Arjun
 krishna ne arjuna kii ab tak di hui sab yuktiyon ko pragnawad kaa jhootha rup kaha
 His trick is that Pragyadarshana essentially accepts all the events and situations of the world from time, karma and nature
 jeena or maranaa, janm lenaa or badhanaa, vishyon kaa aana or janaa
 Experiences of happiness and sorrow, these occur only in the world, this was also called the ancient Acharya synonymism
 kaal kii chakragati in sab sthitiyon ko laati he or le jaati he
 After knowing this nature of life, there is no mourning again
 yahi bhagwaan kaa vyangy he ki pragna ke drushtikon ko maanate hue bhi arjuna is prakaar ke moh main kyon pad gaya he
 An essential part of the above view was the continuity of life and the impermanence of the body
 nity jeev ke liye shok karnaa utana hi vyarth he jitna anitya sharir ko bachaane kii chintaa
 Both of these are unavoidable
 janm or mrityu baari baari se hote hi hai, aisa samajhakar shok karnaa uchit nahin he
 Then another view is of apostasy
 janm se hi prakruti ne sabake liye ek dharm niyat kar diya he
 In it comes the path of life, the periphery of desires, the power of karma
 isse nikal kar nahin bhaaga ja saktaa
 Even if someone runs away, nature again pulls him
 is prakaar kaal kaa parivartan yaa pariman, jeev kii nityata or apana swadharm yaa swabhaav jin yuktiyon se bhagavan, ne arjuna ko samajhaayaa he use unhone sankhya kii buddhi kaha he
 Further, even after Arjuna did not question, he also described the wisdom of the yogamarga
 yah buddhi karm yaa pravriti maarg ke aagrah kii buddhi he isamen karm karte hue karm ke fal kii aasakti se apane ko bachaana aavashyak he
 The biggest fear for the Karmayogi is that he gets trapped in the party of desire for fruit; He should avoid it
 arjuna ko andeh hua ki kya is prakaar kii buddhi praapt karnaa sambhav he
 What would be the situation of a person if he did deeds and no fruit, it was a practical doubt
 usne poocha ki is prakaar kaa drudh pragnawala vyakti jivan kaa vyavhaar kaise karata he? aana, janaa, khaanaa, pinaa, karm karnaa, unamem lipt hokar bhi nirlep kaise rahaa ja saktaa he? krishna ne kitne hi prakaar ke bahya indriyon kii apeksha man ke sanyam kii vyakhya kii he
 Through work, anger, fear, raga, malice, the mild mind is disturbed and the senses are not in control
 indriyajay hi sabase badi aatmajay he
 Even if someone gives up subjects from outside, the inner mind does not agree
 vishyon kaa swaad jab man se jaataa he, tabhi man prafullit, shant or sukhi hota he
 Rivers come in the sea, but he does not give up his dignity
 aise hi sansar main rahete hue, uske vyavhaaron ko sweekaarte hue, anek kaamanaayon kaa pravesh man main hota rahata he
 But those who do not lose their dignity only get peace
 ise pracheen aadhyatm paribhaasha main gita main brahmisthiti kaha he
 Thus, listening to the answer of Sankhya's explanation, in the third chapter called Karmayoga, Arjuna asked a clear question to get deeper into the subject that Sankhya and Yoga do you think well in both these passages and why not say that i am in both of them Whom should i adopt? To this, Krishna replied with the same clearness that there are two loyalties or lifespans in the world - jnana yoga for the Samkhists and karmayoga for the Karmargamis
 yahan koi vyakti karm chhod hi nahin saktaa
 Nature compels a person to perform actions with the effect of all three qualities
 karm se bachnewaalon ke prati ek badi shankaa he, vah yah ki ve upar se to karm chhod baithte hai par man hi man usamen duube rahete hai
 This situation is unbearable and Krishna has called it falsehood in the Gita
 man main karmedriyon ko rokkar karm karnaa hi saral maanviya maarg he
 Krishna even said as a challenge that without karma one cannot get food to eat
 phir krishna ne karm ke vidhaan ko chakra ke rup main upasthit kiya
 Not only are the creations of different persons threaded together on the social plane, but the relationship between man on earth and God of heaven is also dependent on the action cycle
 pratyaksh he ki yahan manushya karm karte hai, krishi karte hai or daivi shaktiyaan vrishti kaa jal bhejti hai
 Both grain and purgenes arise from karma
 ek main maanviya karm, duusare main daivi karm
 Then in favor of Karma, the idea of lok Sangraha has been given, that is, without Karma, the structure of society cannot stand
 jo lok ke netaa hai, janak jaise gyani hai, ve bhi karm main pravriti rakhte hai
 Krishna himself gave his own illustration and said that i am the form of Narayana, there is no work left for me
 phir bhi tandrarahit hokar karm karata hoon or anya log mere maarg par chalate hai
 The difference is that those who are foolish do the work by indulging but the knowledgeable does the work with disrespect
 gita main yaheen ek sabhipraay shabd buddhibhed he
 That is, it is not appropriate to uproot the people of ordinary understanding who are engaged in karma, because they cannot become knowledgeable, and if their karma is missed, they will go astray on both sides
 chauthe adhyay main, jiskaa naam gyaan-karm-sanyas-yoga he, yah bataaya gaya he ki gyaan praapt karke karm karte hue bhi karmsanyas kaa fal kis upaay se praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 In this true Karmayoga is considered to occur in the tradition of the Chakravarti kings
 mandhata, sudarshan aadi anek chakravarti raajaaon ke drushtaant die gaye hai
 This is the famous assurance of the Gita that when there is defamation of religion, then there is an incarnation of God among humans, that is, the power of God is especially tangible
 yaheen par ek vaakya vishesh dhyaan dene yogya he- kshipran hi manushe loke siddhirbhavatee karmaja 
 'karma se siddhi' - There is no more effective sutra in Gitadarshan
 kintu gitatv is sutara main itnaa sudhaar or karata he ki vah karm asang bhav se arthath falasakti se bachakar karnaa chahie
 In the fifth chapter, again she has gone somewhere in the form of tips and perseverance
 isamen karm ke saath jo man kaa sambandh he, uske sanskaar par yaa use vishuddh karne par vishesh dhyaan dilaayaa gaya he
 It has also been said that there is no difference between Sankhya and Yoga by reaching a high level
 kisi ek maarg par thik prakaar se chale to samaan fal praapt hota he
 By surrendering all the deeds of life, a person reaches the pole point of absolute peace and does not indulge in karmic water like a lotus blooming in water
 chatha adhyay aatmasanyam yoga he jiskaa vishay naam se hi prakat he
 The number of subjects is the restraint of the most senses - this is the squeeze of karma and knowledge
 sukh main or dukh main man kii samaan sthiti, ise hi yoga kehete hai
 The noun of the seventh chapter is Jnana Vigyan Yog
 ye pracheen bhartiya darshan kii do paribhaashaayen hai
 Among them, the word science was very important from the Vedic point of view
 sristi ke nanaatv kaa gyaan vigyaan he or nanaatv se ekatv kii ore pragati gyaan he
 Both these views are suitable for humans
 is prasang main vigyaan kii drushti se aparaa or para prakruti ke in do roopon kii jo sunishchit vyakhya yahan gita ne di he, vah avashya dhyaan dene yogya he
 Apara Prakriti has eight elements, Panchabhuta, Mind, Wisdom and Ego
 jis and se maanav kaa janm hota he
 These eight live in it
 kintu yah praakrit sarg he arthath yah jad he
 In this, the consciousness that comes from contact with the efforts of God is called Para Prakriti; He is a living being
 aath tatwon ke saath milakar jivan navaan tatv ho jaataa he
 In this chapter, many forms of God are mentioned, whose further expansion comes in the tenth chapter called Vibhutiog
 yaheen vishesh bhagwati drushti kaa bhi ullekh he jiskaa sutara-vasudev: sarvamiti, sab vasu yaa shariron main ek hi devtatv he, usee kii sangya vishnu he
 But in the people according to their own idi, the same deity is worshiped in many names and forms
 ve sab thik hai
 But it is good that a wise person recognizes the universe which is the highest peak of spiritual science
 aathven adhyay kii sangya akshar brahmyog he
 Akshar Vidya expanded in Upanishads
 gita main us aksharavidya kaa saar kah diya gaya he-akshar brahm paraman, arthath parabrahm kii sangya akshar he
 Spirituality is the name of the combined composition of man, that is, organism and body
 jeevasanyukt bhautik deh kii sangya kshar he or keval shaktitatv kii sangya aadhidaivak he
 The way these three powers work together in the body, the God, and the ghost are called Adhigyas
 gitakar ne do shlokon main in chah paribhaashaon kaa swaroop band diya he
 In the words of Gita, ॐ monosyllable is Brahman
 nawein adhyay ko raajaguhyayog kaha gaya he, arthath yah aadhyatm vidya vidyaraji he or yah guhya gyaan sabamein shreshth he
 The word Raja also had a meaning in mind
 atev man kii divya shaktimayon ko kis prakaar brahmamay banaaya jaay, isaki yukti hi rajvidya he
 In this area, the representation of Brahmanism is predominant, from which the creation of the expressed world is repeated
 veda kaa samast karmkand yajna, amrit, or mrityu, sant or asant, or jitne bhi devi devtaa he, sabakaa paryavsaan brahm main he
 The variety of Devpuja which is popular in the world is also right in its place, this vision of coordination was acceptable to the Bhagwat Acharyas, in fact it was their great power
 isi drushtikon kaa vichaar yaa vyakhya dasven adhyay main pai jaati he
 Its name is Vibhutiog
 iskaa saar yah he ki lok main jitne devtaa hai, sab ek hi bhagwaan, kii vibhutiyaan hai, manushya ke samast gun or avagun bhagwaan kii shakti ke hi rup hai
 Wisdom may be able to explain these liberated gods, but they are there in the world

 But the root or center of it, which is called the upward, is Brahm
 On the one hand, the ultimate glory, which gives rise to the cosmopolitan Ashwattha, is manifested in the form of the Sun and the Moon, on the other hand, it is in a Chaitanya center or Zoological
 Is in the body
 jaisaa gita main spasht kaha he-ahan vaishwanaro bhutva praninaan dehamashrith: 
 There is no more mystery than globalism or pranamayi consciousness

 18wein adhyay kii sangya mokshasanyas yoga he
 It contains a summary and epilogue of all the teachings of the Gita
 yahan pun: balpurvak maanav jivan ke liye teen gunon kaa mahatv kaha gaya he
 There is no one among the human beings of the earth and among the gods of heaven who is saved from these three qualities of nature
 manushya ko bahut dekh bhalkar chalanaa aavashyak he jisase vah apni buddhi or vritti ko buraai se bachaa sake or kya kaary he, kya acarya he, isko pahchaan sake
 The intellect which properly recognizes religion and unrighteousness, bondage and salvation, instinct and retirement, is the true wisdom and is the true achievement of man
 is prakaar bhagwaan ne jivan ke liye vyaavhaarik maarg kaa upadesh dekar ant main yah kaha he ki manushya ko chahie ki sansar ke sab vyavhaaron kaa sachai se paalan karte hue, jo akhand chaitanya tatv he, jise ishwar kehete hai, jo prayek praani ke hriddesh yaa centre main virajman he, usamen vishwaas rakhe, uskaa anubhav kare

 sanskrit sahitya kii parampara main un granthon ko bhashya, kehete hai jo duusare granthon ke arth kii vrihad vyakhya yaa tikaa prastut karte hai
 The Bhagavad Gita is also one of the three texts that had to clarify their perspective in order to establish any new philosophy or any new form of philosophy in the Indian philosophical tradition
 gita par anek achaaryon evam vidwaanon ne tikaayen kii hai
 Their short list according to sects is as follows: inke atirikt maharashtra sant gyandev yaa gyaneshwarkrut bhavarthadipika naam kii tikaa prasiddh he jo gita ke gyaan ko bhavatmak kavyastylee main prakat karti he
 In the present era, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilakkrit Geetarasya Tika, which was first introduced in 1915 with very detailed role and deliberation main puna se prakashit hui thi, gita sahitya main mahatvapurn sthaan rakhti he
 He has made such a diversion in bringing the original meaning of Gita to scholars, which was not possible till today after Shankaracharya
 vastut: shankaracharya kaa bhashya gita kaa mukhya arth gyanaprak karata he jabaki tilak ne gita ko karm kaa pratipadak shastr siddh kiya he
 Among all the languages available on the Bhagavad Gita, the element of Shri Jayadayal Goindka is the most popular and popular

 In the serial Mahabharata, aired on Doordarshan, Bhagavad Gita was a special attraction, while in the serial Sri Krishna, the Bhagwad Gita was highly researched and shown as a series of episodes
 isaki ek vishesh baat yah rahi ki gita se sambandhit saamaanya manushya ke sandehon ko arjuna ke prashnon ke madhyam se uttarit karne kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Apart from this, the serial gita-rahasya by Nitish Bhardwaj was completely focused on different dimensions of Gita itself
 internet par bhi aaj anekanek websiten is vishay par bahumadhyamon ke dwaara vishad jaankaree detii hai
 Shrimad Bhagwadgita is currently attracting attention of people not only in India but also abroad with her philosophical approach towards life more than religion
 nishkaam karm kaa gita kaa sandesh prabandhan guruon ko bhi lubhaa rahaa he
 It is included in the most famous books of all religions of the world

 The teachings of the Gita are very ancient yoga
 shri bhagavan kehete hai ise maine sabase pehle surya se kaha tha
 The Sun is the symbol of knowledge, so the words of Shri God mean that even before the creation of the earth, i have given this knowledge to the devotees who have done many forms of research
 yah ishwariya vaani he jisamen sampoorn jivan kaa saar he evam aadhaar he
 Who am I? What is this body? Is my beginning and end with this body? Will i exist after my body renunciation? Where and in what form will this existence exist? What is the reason for me coming into the world? What will happen after leaving my body, where will i go? These things keep revolving in the heart of any curious person
 ham sadaa in baton ke bare main sochate hai or apane ko, apane swaroop ko nahin jaan pate
 In the Gita Shastra, the answers to all these questions have been readily given by Shri Bhagwan through religious dialogue
 is deh ko jisamen 36 tatv jeevatma kii upasthiti ke kaaran judakar kaary karte hai, kshetra kaha he or jeevatma is kshetra main nivas karata he, vahi is deh kaa swami he parantu ek teesraa purush bhi he, jab vah prakat hota he; adhidaiv arthath 36 tatwon vaale is deh ko or jeevatma kaa naash kar daalata he
 This perfect man is the ultimate state and ultimate truth
 yahi nahin, deh main sthit or deh tyagkar jate hue jeevatma kii gati kaa yatharth vaigyanik env tarksangat varnan gita shaastra main hua he
 The soul is eternal and the soul has attained the spirit of life
 sharir ke mar jane par jeevatma apane karmanusaar vibhinn yoniyon main vicharan karata he
 The Gita begins with the word Dharma and at the end of the eighteenth chapter of the Gita it is called Dharma Samvad
 dharm kaa arth he dhaaran karne vaala athwa jise dhaaran kiya gaya he
 The one who holds is called the soul and the one who holds it is nature
 aatma is sansar kaa beej arthath pita he or prakruti garbhadhaaran karne vaali yoni arthath mata he
 The word Dharma is used in the Gita from place to place for self-nature and living nature
 isi paripeksh main dharm evam adharm ko samajhnaa aavashyak he
 The nature of the soul is religion or it is said that religion is spirit
 aatma kaa swabhaav he purna shuddh gyaan, gyaan hi anand or shaanti kaa akshay dham he
 On the contrary, ignorance signifies unrest, tribulation and unrighteousness
 aatma akshay gyaan kaa strot he
 Kriya Shakti arises from different amounts of knowledge power, birth of nature
 prakruti ke gun satva, raj, tam kaa janm hota he
 Excess of sattva-raja gives rise to religion, demonic circles prevail in excess of tam-raja and the establishment of dharma means to establish the nature of virtues, for the growth of satoguna, soul attaining indestructible Brahmi status, its resolve She incarnates herself and performs incarnation
 sampoorn gita shaastra kaa nichod he buddhi ko hameshaa sookshm karte hue mahabuddhi aatma main lagaaye rakkho tathaa sansar ke karm apane swabhaav ke anusaar saral rup se karte raho
 It is easy to do nature's karma and it is difficult to follow the other's nature's karma, because every living being is born with a different nature, it becomes easy to live in the nature that has come into the world
 shri bhagwaan ne sampoorn gita shaastra main baar-baar atmrat, aatm sthit hone ke liye kaha he
 It is easy for the intellect to become detached while doing natural deeds, so it is considered the definitive path
 yadhyapi alag-alag dekha jaay to gyaan yoga, buddhi yoga, karm yoga, bhakthi yoga aadi kaa gita main upadesh diya he parantu sookshm drushti se vichaar kiya jaay to sabhi yoga buddhi se shri bhagwaan ko arpan karte hue kiye ja sakate hai isse anasakt yoga nishkaam karm yoga swatah siddh ho jaataa he
 Just as before Newton the force of gravity worked, but Newton gave the terms of the term to make the world aware of the proclaimed principles of "law of gravity", which is known as Newton's theory of gravitation

 enentipi · esaypi · esaysai · dnes · afatipi · gofar · achtitipi · eneges · antipi · esampipi · esaimatipi · esenempi · tailnet The open system interconnect reference model is an emotional description for layer communication and computer network innovation design
 iskaa vikaas khuli pranali atanrasampark upkram ke taur par kiya gaya tha
 By default, it divides the network structure into seven layers, from top to bottom in order, application, presentation, session, traffic, network, content-link, and physical layer
 atah ise aksar "oesai saat parati pratimaan" bhi kaha jaataa he
 Each layer is a group of theoretically similar functions, which serve the layer above it and receive services from the layer below it
 har parat main ek "drushtaant" upar vaali parat ke drushtaanton ko seva pradaan karata he or neeche vaali paraton se seva karne kaa anurodh karata he
 For example, the layer that provides a flawless connection to a mesh provides the desired path to the applications above and to do this it requests a bundle from the lower layer so that the contents of the path can be created
 siddhanthata ek parat main maujuud do drushtaant aapas main sampark karne ke liye usee parat ke ek samastareey navachaar judaav kaa istemaal karte hai
 There are mainly two reasons for using the OSI model: 1977 main jaal sanrachana ke paratdaar pratimaan par kaam shuru hua or antarrashtriya maanakeekaran sanghathan ne apane oesai dhaanche kii sanrachana shuru kii
 There are two main pieces of OSI: a sentential pattern for nets, called the original reference pattern or seven spatial patterns, and some special innovation
 dhyaan de: oesai pratimaan ko varnit karne vaale maanak dastaavaz itiu-tii kii X
200 shrunkhlaa kii sifaarishon ke naam se muft utaare ja sakate hai
 The ITU-X series also has specifications for several innovations
 oesai pratimaan ke samatuly iesao / iisi maanak iesao uplabdh karata he, lekin sabhi muft nahin hai
 All aspects of the OSI structure evolved through experiences with the Cyclades network, which also affected the structure of the Internet
 nai sanrachana ko iesao 7498 va uske kai parishishton main pralekhith kiya gaya
 In this model, the mesh system is divided into layers
 har parat main ek yaa adhik ikai parat kii kaaryon ko lagu karti he
 Each unit interacts directly with the layer just below it and prepares and provides facilities for the use of the layer above it
 ek mejabaan main maujuud ek ikai, duusare mejabaan kii usee parat main maujuud samaan ikai se sampark saadhane ke liye nawacharon kaa istemaal karti he
 Service definitions provide an emotional description of the features provided layer by layer
 bhautik parat upkarnon kii vidyutiya va bhautik vinirdesh paribhaashit karti he
 It specifically defines the relationship between an instrument and a physical medium
 isamen pin, voltage, cabel vinirdesh, jaal hub, ripeter, jaal card, mezbaan bas adapter va anya chizon kii jamaavat shaamil he
 To understand the difference between a material-hardened layer and a physical layer, note that the physical-layer is primarily concerned with the specification of a device with a medium, whereas the content-hardened layer is primarily concerned with the specification of multiple devices with a common medium
 Is bhautik parat kisi upkaran ko yah bataati he ki kisi madhyam ko kuch preshan kaise kiya jaae, yaa usase kaise kuch praapt kiya jaae 
 Standards such as RS-232 actually use physical wiring to control access to the medium
 bhautik parat dwaara pradutt pramukh sevaayen va suvidhaayen hai - Parallel SCSI buses fall under this layer, although it is worth noting that the logical SCSI innovation is the innovation of the traffic layer, which runs over this bus
 kii bhautik parat ethernet navachaar bhi isi parat main hai, ethernet is parat va saamagree-kadi parat dono main aata he
 The same applies to other local-area networks, such as Token Ring, FDDI, ITU-T G
HN and IEEE 820
11
 nijee kshatra jaalon par bhi yah lagu hoti he jaise ki nildant va iiqui 820
15
 The material link layer provides a functional and procedural method for exchanging materials between mesh units, as well as detecting and correcting possible errors in the physical layer
 shuruyaat main yah parat bindu-se-bindu va bindu-se-bahubindu madhyamon ke liye thi, jo ki dhoorbhaash pranali main vishaal kshetra madhyamon kii visheshta hoti he
 The local regional network structure, which also included broadcast-capable multi-access media, developed under IEEE Project 802, in addition to the work of ISO
 iiqui ne up-parateekaran va prabandhikaran kaaryon par jor diya, jinaki dablyueen main zarurat nahin thi
 In modern times, only hard-to-find innovations are present in material innovations, but flow control is not controlled through sliding window
 nawacharon ke udhaaharan hai bindu-se-bindu navachaar 
 IEEE 802
2 LLC is not used in most local area networks for most Ethernet innovations
 sthaneey kshetra jaalon main iske bahaav niyantranon va pavati yuktiyon kaa bahut kam istemaal hota he
 Slot window flow control and acknowledgment are used in traffic layer innovations such as TCP
 iskaa istemaal kuch khaas jagahon par abhi bhi hota he jahaan eks
25 ke jariye zyaada tezi milti he
 The ITU-T G
HN standard, which provides a fast local field mesh over existing wires, provides an entire material link layer with both error correction and drift control through selective repetitive fenestration innovation
 dablyooee va aleen sevaayen - dono hi bhautik parat se bit yojit karke taarkik anukramon banaati hai, jinhen dhaanchaa kehete hai
 Not all bits of the physical layer go into the structure, as some bits are only for pure physical layer functions
 udhaaharan ke liye affdidiai bit dhara kii har paanchavi bit kaa istemaal parat nahin karti he
 Connection-oriented WAN content engagement innovations, in addition to creating frameworks, can find and fix errors
 ye prasaaran dar ko bhi niyantrit kar sakate hai
 The WAN can implement a material mobilization layer sliding obturator flow control and acknowledgment system to provide a reliable distribution of structures - the same happens in SDLC and HDLC, and in LAPB and LAPD derived from HDLC
 vyaavhaarik, judaavheen aleen kii shuruyaat iiqui ke purv kii ethernet vinirdesh ke saath shuru hue
 This specification is the ancestor of IEEE 802

 yah parat upkarnon kaa kisi saajhe madhyam ke saath sampark prabandhit karata he, yah kaam madhyam pahunch niyantran up-parat kaa kaary he
 Above this MAC sub-layer is the medium-independent IEEE 802
2 Logical Connection Control sub-layer, which performs addressing and multiplexing in a multi-entry medium
 iiqui 802
3 hi pramukh taar vaala aleen navachaar he or iiqui 802
11 betaar navachaar he
 Obsolete MAC layers count token rings and fddis
 emesi up-parat trutiyaan pakad to letaa he par unhen thik nahin karata he
 The mesh layer provides material and process related transfer of material of different lengths from source to destination through one or more nets
 yah karte hue, jaal parat, yatayaat parat dwaara anurodhit seva gunvattta ko barkaraar rakhata he
 The mesh layer acts as a mesh routing and can also perform fragmentation and linking, and also detail distribution errors
 anumaark is parat main kaam karte hai
 They make it possible to send content to a wide network
 yah ek taarkik sambodhan vidhi he - mulyon kaa chayan jaal abhiyantaa dwaara kiya jaataa he
 The addressing method is hierarchical
 parat 3 ke navachaar kii sabase acha udhaaharan he antarjaal navachaar 
 It manages the seamless transfer of content, with one jump at a time - from the initial system to the entry routers, then from the routers to the routers and then from the exit routers to the target final system
 agle oochaal tak vishwasaneey vitaran isaki jimmedaari nahin he, jimmedaari he keval truti vaale pulindon kaa pataa lagaana taaki ve hataa die ja saken
 If the next bounce medium cannot accept a truss of the current length, then the IP is responsible for making this truss a number of smaller trunks so that the medium can accept them
 parat prabandhan navachaar ke kai kaary, jo ki prabandhan parishisht, iesao 7498 / 4 main paribhaashit hai, jaal parat kaa hissaa hai
 These include routing innovation, multi-broadcast group management, network layer information and error, and naming the layer layer address
 pelod kaa kaary inhen jaal parat kaa sadsy banaata he, inhen le jane vaala navachaar nahin
 The traffic layer exchanges content between users and provides reliable content transfer services to the upper layers
 yatayaat parat kisi bhi kadi kii vishwasaneeyata ko niyantrit karti he, iske liye bahaav niyantran, vibhaajan / avibhaajan or truti niyantran kaa istemaal hota he
 Some innovations are situated and engagement oriented
 iskaa matlab yah he ki yatayaat parat vibhaajanon kaa hisaab rakh sakati he or jahaan truti aae unhen phir se bhej sakati he
 While these are not subject to the OSI context model nor fully satisfy the OSI definition of the traffic layer, but still some examples of layer 4 are distribution control innovation and user data innovation
 vaastavik oesai nawacharon main paanch prakaar ke judaav-aadhaarit yatayaat navachaar hai - kaksha 0 se le ke kaksha 4 
 Class 0 does not contain an error exit rule and was designed for mesh layers that can provide impeccable association
 kaksha 4 tisipi ke sabase kareeb he, halaanki tisipi main kuch suvidhaayen hai jo oesai satr parat main maanata he jaise ki sukhad samaapti
 Also, all OSITP connection-based innovation classes provide instant content and protection boundaries protection, TCP cannot do anything in either
 tipi0-4 kakshaon ke bare main vistaar se jaankaree is talika main he - Perhaps a good way to think about the traffic layer would be to compare it to the post office, which does the remittance and classification of received letters
 lekin yaad rakhen ki daakkhaana keval chitthee ke lifaafe ke hisaab se prabandhan karata he
 High-level layers can handle double envelopes, such as camouflaged presentation services that only the final recipient can disguise
 duusari tarah se kahen to surangi navachaar yatayaat parat main hote hai, jaise ki gair-ypi navachaar - ibiem kaa esene yaa navel kaa ai pi jaal par chalane vaala ipex yaa ipisek ke jariye purna chadmikaran
 The simple routing encapsulation mesh layer may have an innovation, but if the encapsulation of the payload is only at the endpoint, the GRE IP header is used, but still the whole infrastructure or bundle becomes a one-time traffic innovation
 el2tipi ek yatayaat pulindia main pipipi dhaanche le jaataa he
 The session layer controls the interactions between computers
 yah sthaneey va duurastha anuprayog ke bich judaav sthapit, prabandhit va samaapt karata he
 It performs a full-duplex, half-duplex, or unidirectional action, and establishes the process of test pointing, postponement, termination, and restart
 oesai pratimaan ne is parat ko satron kii sukhad samaapti kii jimmedaari di he jo ki vitaran niyantran navachaar kii khubi he, yah satr jaanch bindukaran va ugaahi kaa bi kaam karata he jo ki aamtaur par antarjaal nawacharon main nahin hota he
 The session layer is typically applied specifically to application environments in which remote method calls are used
 prastutikaran parat anuprayog parat ikaayiyon ke bich sandarbh sthapit karti he, gimen upree parat vaali ikaiyaan alag alag vaakya vinyas va arth vigyaan kaa istemaal kar sakati hai, basharte prastutikaran seva dono ke bich maanchitran karne main samarth ho
 The presentation service content units are then converted into session innovation content units and thus transported to the bottom of the stack
 yah parat saamagree pratinidhitiv main fark se mukti detaa he - anuprayog va jaal praaroop main adla badali kar ke
 The presentation layer presents the content in such a way that the application layer can accept it
 yah parat jaal main bheje jane vaali saamagree kaa praroopan va chadmikaran karata he, taaki visangati kii dikkat na aae
 It is also often called syntax layer
 mul prastutikaran dhaanchaa bhavatmak vaakya vinyas sanketan ek kaa istemaal karata tha, isamen ibisidiisi-paath sanchika ko eessiaiai sanchika main badalanaa, yaa vastuon ko dharawahit kar ke exmel yaa iskaa ulta karnaa shaamil hai
 The application layer is the layer of OSI that is closest to the user, that is, both the OSI application layer and the user directly contact the application application directly
 yah parat un tantransh anuprayogon se sampark karte hai jo kisi samparkrat tukdon ko lagu karte hai
 Such application programs fall outside the limits of the OSI paradigm
 anuprayog parat ke kaaryaklap praayah hote hai, sanchaar bhagidaaron ko pahchaanana, sansadhano kii uplabdhta pataa lagaana or sanchaar ko samakaleen bananaa
 When locating communication partners, the application layer has to ascertain who the contact partners are and whether they are available for any application that wants to transmit content
 sansaadhan uplabdhta pataa karte samay anuprayog parat ko yah faisalaa karnaa hota he ki anurodhit sanchaar ke liye paryaapt jaal sansaadhan uplabdh hai yaa nahin
 All communication between applications requires collaboration, which is managed by the application layer, making the communication synchronous
 anuprayog parat ke kuch karyanvit udhaaharan hai tailnet, unnatapath sthanantaran navachaar, sanchika sthanantaran navachaar, va saral dak sthanantaran navachaar 
 None of the OSI reference patterns or OSI innovations specify any programming interface
 ye bas keval seva kii bhavatmak nirdishtitaayen hi pradaan karte hai
 The innovation specifications explicitly specify the interface between different computers, but the protocol specifications within a computer are different for each implementation
 udaahranarth microsaft windos kaa vinsa or unics kaa barkali socket tathaa pranali 5 kii yatayaat parat antaraprishth, anuprayogon va yatayaat ke bich ke antaraprishth hai
 NDIS and ODI are the interface between medium and web innovation
 bhautik parat se madhyam ke alaava, baaki sabhi antaraprishth maanak, lagbhag oesai seva nirdashtataaon ke hi karyanyavyan hai
 The innovations in the TCP / IP paradigm of Internet innovations are not deliberately divided into separate layers like the OSI paradigm
 arefasi3439 main "parateekaran nuksaandeh mana gaya" naam kaa ek vibhaag he
 But still TCP / IP identifies four thick layers based on activity, based on the scope of operation of the innovations contained in them
 ye daayre hai tantransh anuprayog, ant-se-ant yatayaat judaav, antarjaleey dayera or antat kshetreey jaal main anya grathiyon ke saath sidhe judaav kaa dayera
 This hypothesis differs from OSI, yet it has similar comparisons to the OSI reacquisition method: the Internet application layer consists of the osi's application layer, the presentation layer, and most of the session layer
 ant-se-ant yatayaat parat main oesai satr parat kii sundar samaapti suvidha va oesai yatayaat parat shaamil hai
 The interconnect layer is a subset of the OSI network layer and the link layer consists of the OSI network-link and physical layers, as well as many parts of the OSI network layer
 in paraton kaa aadhaar iesao 7498 ke mul saat-partiya navachaar pratimaan he, na ki jaal parat dastauez ke aantarik sanghathan main sudhaar aadi
 The client / consumer layers are described fairly rigorously in OSI, but they are not at odds with the case of TCP / IP, as there is no need to follow the hierarchy of the paradigm paradigm for the use of innovations
 aise udhaaharan kuch anumaargan nawacharon main bhi hai, yaa phir surangikaran nawacharon ke varnan main bhi he, ye kisi anuprayog ke liye kadi parat pradaan karte hai, jabaki ho saktaa he ki surang mejabaan navachaar apane aap main yatayaat yaa anuprayog parat hi ho
 The structure of TCP / IP generally prefers decisions based on simplicity, effectiveness and ease of implementation

 Classical information regarding plays is called Natya Shastra
 is jaankaree kaa sabase purana granth bhi naatyashaastra ke naam se janaa jaataa he jiske rachayita bharat muni the
 The lifetime of Bharata Muni is believed to be sometime between 400 BC to 100 AD
 sangeet, naatak or abhinay ke sampurna granth ke rup main bharatmuni ke natya shaastra kaa aaj bhi bahut sammaan he
 He believes that the rules of theatrical composition are not only assessed in the Natya Shastra, but the actor theater and observers interpret the means to fulfill these three elements
 37 adhyyon main bharatmuni ne rangamanch abhinayta abhinay nritygitvaadya, darshak, dasharupak or ras nishpatti se sambandhit sabhi tathyon kaa vivechan kiya he
 It is clear from Bharata's study of the Natya Shastra that the success of the play is not based solely on the talent of the writer but also with the cooperation of various arts and artists
 natya or nritt, drishy kavy ke ye do bhed hai
 Anatruti Natya of a particular state by nati-nati is - 'natyate Abhinataveen Rupayate- Iti Natyam'
 taal or lay kii sangati se anubaddh anukrit ko nritt kehete hai
 Both of these are subjects of acting and are considered under the fine arts
 natya ke pramukh ang chaar hai - vaachik, satvik, angik or aharya
 The exact replication of utterances is a matter of oral performance
 bhaavon kaa yathavat pradarshan satvik abhinay he
 For the performance of the hands, feet, eyes, bruises, and various gestures of the limb, mouth, head, etc
, there is an imitative act
 deshavidesh ke anuroop veshbhusha, chaaldhaal, rahan sahan or boli kii anukriti aharya abhinay kaa vishay he
 The research of dance, song, instrument and tempo, instinct, tendency and posture, which is instrumental to the performance of the quadrant, is also under the play
 is prakaar abhinay ke vividh ang evam upangon ke swaroop or prayog ke akaarprakaar kaa vivaran prastut kar tatsambandhi niyam tathaa vyavhaar ko nirdhaarit karanevaala shaastra 'naatyashaastra' he
 According to the place of acting, the place is called Natyagriha, as such, the construction and rendering of the rules of decoration is also the subject of Natyashastra
 vividh shrenee ke abhinayta evam abhinetri ke vyavhaar, paraspar sanlap or abhinay ke nirdesan evam nirdeshak ke kartavyon kaa vivaran bhi naatyashaastra kii vyapak paridhi main samavisht he
 Its main purpose is to entertain the hardworking masses from the many afflictions of the physical life - it is a simple means of fun for the Gods, demons and human society
 yah nayanon kii tripti karanevaala evam bhavodrek kaa parimarjan kar prekshakvarg kaa aahlaadit karanevaala manoram anusandhan he - yah jatibhed, vargabhed, vayobhed aadi naiysargik evam saamaajik vibhedon se nirpeksh, bhinn ruchi kii janata kaa saamaanya rup se samaaraadhan karanevaala ek kaant, 'chakshushakratu' he
 Its promoter is Prajapati himself, who gave birth to the text of the Rigveda, songs from the Samaveda, acting from the Yajurveda and accession of Rasa from the Atharvangiras
 uma-mahadev ne suprit ho lokanuranjan ke hetu lasya evam tandav kaa sahyog dekar ise upakrit kiya he
 In fact, there is no such scripture, no craft, no education nor any art which is not represented in Natyashastra
 is tarah anupam divyata se anupranit naatyashaastra ke adhishthata dev kii bhi kalpana, itar veda evam vedangon ke adhishthaataaon kii bhanti, kii gai he jiske swaroop kaa ullekh 'nrisinghprasaad' naamak granth main miltaa he
 The name of the rules of theatrical rules is 'natyashastra'
 bhartiya parampara ke anusaar naatyashaastra ke aadya rachayita swayan prajapati maane gaye hai or use 'natyaved' kahkar natyakala ko vishisht sammaan pradaan kiya gaya he
 Just as the seer of the Vedrashi, born of the supreme man's self-assurance, is considered diverse sage, in the same way, the seer of the Natya Veda propounded by Mahadev is considered Shilali, Krishna and Bharatamuni
 shilaali evam krishashv dwaara sankalit natyasanhitaayein aaj uplabdh nahin he, keval bharat muni dwaara pranit granth hi uplabdh hua he jo 'naatyashaastra' ke naam se prathit he
 It was probably originated in the country of Kashmir

 In this book, there is the impression of Pratibhagya philosophy

 Untraiyya text and 2
 Dakshinatya
 pandulipiyon main ek or 37vaan adhyay bhi kvachit uplabdh hota he jiskaa samavesh nirnyasagari sanskaran main sampadak ne kiya he
 Apart from this, the original text is also published from the Chaukhamba Sanskrit Series, Varanasi, whose text is different from the text of Decision
 abhinav bharti tikaa sahit naatyashaastra kaa sanskaran gayakwad series ke antargat baroda se prakashit he
 In fact, this book is the fundamental code of theatrical constitution and Rasasiddhanta
 isaki manyata itani adhik he ki iske vaakya 'bharatsutra' kahe jate hai
 For centuries, it has received great respect
 is granth main mulat: 12,000 padya tathaa kuch gadyansh bhi tha, isi kaaran ise 'dwadashasahasri samhita' kaha jaataa he
 But in chronological order, its short version became prevalent, whose dimension was six thousand verses and this short code was called 'satsahsri'
 bharatmuni ubhay samhita ke praneta maane jate hai or pracheen tikaakaron dwaara unka 'dwadash sahasricar' tathaa 'shatsahasricar' kii oopaadhi se paraamarsh yatra tatra kiya gaya he
 Just as the basis of Chanakya policy available today, the basis of old Chanakya and memories are considered to be old Vashishtha, old Manu, respectively, in the same way there is mention of Vriddhi Bharat
 iskaa yah taatpary nahin ki vasishtha, manu, chanakya, bharat aadi do do vyakti ho gaye, parantu is sandarbh main 'vruddh' kaa taatpary paripurna samhitakaar se he
 Numerous interpretations were written on the Natyashastra and the lecturers of the Bharatasutras were considered to be the founding masters of their own doctrine, whose views became popular in the form of various poetic debates
 aise aacharyon main ullekhneey naatyashaastra ke vyaakhyaata hai- ritivaadee bhatta udbhat, pushtivaadee bhatta lollat, anumitivaadee shankuk, muktivaadee bhatta nayak or abhivyaktivaadee abhinav gupt
 Apart from these, Nakhkut, Matrugupta, Rahulak, Kirtidhar, Thakaligarbha, Harshadeva and Shripadashishya also presented their interpretations on the Natyashastra
 inamen se 'shripadashishyakrut' 'bharattilak' naam kii tikaa sarvapracheen prathit hoti he
 Sangeetadhyaya's lecturers in the Natyasastra have become numerous
 jinamein pramukh bhatta sumnas, bhattavriddhi, bhattayantra or bhatta gopal hai
 Apart from these, the musicically independent texts based on Bharatamuni's main disciples Matang, Dattil and Kohl's Natyashastra, Sadashiva and Randikeshwar have composed on dance and Bhatt Taut Prabhriti has written on Rasamimamsa

 Syntactic is a famous Sanskrit grammar book
 ise trikandi bhi kehete hai
 Syntactic grammar is the main philosophical text of the series
 iske rachayita nitishatak ke rachayita mahavaiyaakaran tathaa yogiraj bhartruhari hai
 His guru's name was Vasurat
 bhartruhari ko kisi ne teesri, kisi ne chauthi tathaa chhathi yaa saatvi sadi main rakhaa he
 In the phrase, Bhartrihari has expressed his views on the nature of language and its relation to the external world
 yah granth teen bhaagon main vibhakt he jinhen "cond" kehete hai
 This entire book is written in verse
 pratham "brahmakand" he jisamen 157 karikas hai, doosraa "vaakyakand he jisamen 493 karikas hai or teesraa "padcand" ke naam se prasiddh he
 Its first episode is Brahmakanda in which the nature of the word is explained
 isamen shabd ko brahm mana gaya he or brahm kii prapti ke liye shabd ko pramukh saadhan bataaya gaya he
 In the second episode, Bhartrihari has given different views about the sentence
 tisare kand main anya darshanik ritiyon ke vishyon, jaise - jati, dravya, kaal aadi kii charchaa kii gayi he
 In this, Bhartrihari tries to show that diverse views illuminate different dimensions of the same object
 is prakaar ve sabhi darshanon ko apane vyakaran aadhaarit darshan dwaara ekikaran karne kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 Grammar scripture is basically Agam Shastra
 isaki abhivyakti maheshwar se he
 According to Agam, the word has four forms - "para", "pashyanti", "madhyama" and "vaikhari"
 inamen "para" hi brahm he
 That is why in the first sentence of the phrase, word is called eternal and infinite and the letter Brahm
 isi pararup brahm se sansar ke padaarthon kii utpatti tathaa vyavhaar vivartarup main mana gaya he
 In the first episode, there is a view of the philosophical form of syllogism, hence it is named "brahmakanda" and has been proved to be a simple form
 vastut: yah aagmik cond he
 It is written from the point of view of Agama
 is cond kii kuch upyogi tathaa jaanane yogya baaten ye hai- The methods and form of attainment of that Brahma have been called "vedas" by the Maharishi
 yah ek hota hua bhi anek maaloom hota he
 That is why the four Vedas are called Rakyajush, Sama and Atharvan
 rugveda kii 21, yajurveda kii 100, samaveda kii 1000 tathaa atharvaveda kii 9 milakar 1130 shakhaayen veda kii hui
 Even then, the only propitious subject of all the Vedas and their branches is "karma"
 yah samaran rakhana he ki jo shabd yaa mantra jis swar main jis shakha main padhaa gaya he vah shabd usee tarah uccharan kiye jane par fal denevaala hota he
 Reading the same word in the same branch in the same form will result in this interpretation, otherwise it will not give any other fruit
 aagam ke bina kartavya evam akartavya kaa nishchay nahin ho saktaa
 The knowledge of seeing imperceptible things among sages is also obtained through Agama
 tark ke dwaara koi yatharth gyaan nahin praapt ho saktaa, vah parivartansheel he
 For the higher level sages, the past and future are all visible
 gyaan ke swaprakash hone ke kaaran usamen aatma kaa swaroop tathaa ghat aadi gyey padaarth kaa swaroop donon bhaasith hote hai
 Similarly, the word has both its form of meaning and its own form
 jis prakaar jayapushp ke ke laal rup se sambhddha hi sphatik kaa grahan hota he usee prakaar sphot se mili hui dhwani kaa hi grahan hota he
 No one is of the opinion that just as the quality of senses is insensitive and is the cause of knowledge of subjects, similarly sound is the reason for knowledge of words without being insensitive
 doosraa mat he ki "doortv" dosha ke kaaran sphot ke swaroop kaa gyaan nahin hota, keval dhwani kaa hi bhaan hota he

 But Devi Bhagwat counts 'bhagavata' under the subpuras and itself under the Puranas
