bijapur ke sultan ne swayan kaman samhaalkar panhala, pavangadh par apana adhikaar waapas le liya, rajapur ko lut liya or shringargarh ke pradhan ko maar daalaa
 At the same time, due to the revolt of Siddijauhar in Karnataka, the Sultan of Bijapur entered into an agreement with Shivaji
 is sandhi main shivaji ke pita shahji ne madhyasthata kaa kaam kiya
 According to this treaty in 1662, Shivaji was recognized as an independent ruler by the Sultan of Bijapur
 isi sandhi ke anusaar uttar main kalyaan se lekar dakshin main ponda tak kaa or purv main indapur se lekar pashchim main daawul tak kaa bhubhag shivaji ke niyantran main aa gaya
 Shivaji's army had by this time 30,000 infantry and 1000 cavalry
 uttar bharat main badshaah banane kii hode khatm hone ke baad aurangzeb kaa dhyaan dakshin kii taraf gaya
 He was aware of Shivaji's growing sovereignty and appointed his maternal uncle Shaista Khan as the Subedar of the South for the purpose of keeping control over Shivaji
 shyska khan apane 1,50,000 phoj lekar soupan or chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar puna pahunch gaya
 He looted in Maval for 3 years
 ek raat shivaji ne apane 350 mavalo ke saath unpar hamalaa kar diya
 Shaista managed to escape through the window but had to wash her hands with her four fingers in this sequence
 shysta khan ke putr, tathaa chalis rakshakon or anginat sainikon kaa katl kar diya gaya
 After this incident Aurangzeb made Shaista the Subedar of Bengal instead of Deccan and Shahzada Muazzam was sent to replace Shaista
 is jeet se shivaji kii pratishtha main vruddhi hui
 Six years later, Shaista Khan destroyed King Shivaji's entire Mulukh with his 15 xxrep 4 0 army
 is liye us kaa harjaana vasuul karne ke liye shivaji ne mughal kshetron main lutpaat machaana armbh kiya
 Surat was then a stronghold of Western merchants and a gateway for Hindustani Muslims to perform Haj
 yah ek samrudh nagar tha or iskaa bandargah bahut mahatvapurn tha
 Shivaji looted the wealthy merchants of Surat for six days in 1664 with an army of four thousand
 aam aadmi ko unhonen nahin lutaa or phir laut gaye
 The Dutch and the British have mentioned this incident in their articles
 us samay tak europea vyapaariyon ne bharat tathaa anya asian deshon main bas gayi the
 Until Nadir Shah invaded India, no European power thought of attacking the Indian Mughal Empire
 surat main shivaji kii lut se khinn hokar aurangzeb ne inayat khan ke sthaan par gayasuddin khan ko surat kaa faujadaar niyukt kiya
 And Shahzada Muazzam and Deputy General Raja Jaswant Singh were replaced by Diler Khan and Raja Jaisingh
 raja jaisingh ne bijapur ke sultan, europea shaktiyaan tathaa chote samanton kaa sahyog lekar shivaji par akraman kar diya
 In this war, Shivaji started to suffer loss and seeing the possibility of defeat, Shivaji sent a proposal for a treaty
 june 1665 main hui is sandhi ke mutabik shivaji 23 durg mughalon ko de denge or is tarah unke paas keval 12 durg batch jaayenge
 The income from these 23 fortifications was 4 lakh Huns annually
 balaghat or konkan ke kshetra shivaji ko milenge par unhen iske badale main 13 kishton main 40 lakh hun adaa karne honge
 Apart from this, they will also give revenue of 5 lakh Huns every year
 shivaji swayan aurangzeb ke darbar main hone se mukt rahenge par unke putr shambhaji ko mughal darbar main khidamat kerani hogi
 Shivaji will support the Mughals against Bijapur
 shivaji ko agra bulaayaa gaya jahaan unhen laga ki unhen uchit sammaan nahin mil rahaa he
 Against this, he showed his fury in the court and accused Aurangzeb of betrayal
 aurangzeb isse kshubdh hua or usne shivaji ko nazarkaid kar diya or unpar 5000 sainikon ke pehre laga diye
 Aurangzeb intended to kill King Shivaji a few days later
 lekin apane ajod saahas ore yukti ke saath shivaji or sambhaaji donon isse bhaagane main safal rahe
 Shivaji Maharaj went to Banaras after leaving Sambhaji in Mathura with a believing Brahmin, went to Puri and went safely to Rajgarh
 isse maraathon ko navajivan sa mil gaya
 Aurangzeb suspected Jaisingh and got him murdered by poisoning him
 jaswant singh ke dwaara pahal karne ke baad san 1668 main shivaji ne mughalon ke saath duusari baar sandhi kii
 Aurangzeb recognized Shivaji as the king
 shivaji ke putr shambhaji ko 5000 kii manasabadari mili or shivaji ko puna, chaakan or soopa kaa jila lautaa diya gaya
 However, the Mughal suzerainty over Sinhagad and Purandar remained
 san 1670 main surat nagar ko duusari baar shivaji ne lutaa
 Shivaji got the property worth 132 lakhs from the city and while returning he defeated the Mughal army again near Surat
 san 1674 tak shivaji ne un saare pradeshon par adhikaar kar liya tha jo purandar kii sandhi ke antargat unhen mughalon ko dene pade the
 After the establishment of an independent Hindu nation in western Maharashtra, Shivaji wanted to crown his coronation, but Muslim soldiers threatened the Brahmins that whoever crowned Shivaji would be killed
 When this thing reached Shivaji that the Mughal Sardar is making such threats, then Shivaji took it as a challenge and said that now he will get anointed from the Brahmin of that state who is in the authority of the Mughals
 Shivaji's personal secretary Balaji sent three emissaries to Kashi, because Kashi was under the Mughal Empire
 When the messengers gave the message, the Brahmins of Kashi were quite pleased
 But the Mughal soldiers came to know about this and then caught those Brahmins
 But wisely those Brahmins told those messengers in front of the Mughal sannyko that we do not know who Shivaji is
 What line are they from? The messengers did not know that is why they said we do not know
 Then in front of the Sardar of the Mughal soldiers, those Brahmins said that we have to go somewhere else, from which clan Shivaji you have not told, so how can we crown him
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji
 iske baad mughalo ne foot daalane kii koshis kii or shivaji ke rajbhishek ke baad bhi puna ke brahmanon ko dhamkee di kaha ki shivaji ko raja maanane se manaa karo

 shivaji ne ashtapradhan mandal kii sthapana kii
 vibhinn rajyon ke duuton, pratinidhiyon ke alaava videshi vyapaariyon ko bhi is samaaroh main aamantrit kiya gaya
 But 12 days after his coronation, his mother had died, for this reason, on 4 October 1674, Shivaji assumed the title of Chhatrapati for the second time
 do baar hue is samaaroh main lagbhag 50 lakh rupee kharch hue
 The establishment of Hindu Swaraj was announced in this ceremony
 vijaynagar ke patan ke baad dakshin main yah pehla hindu samrajya tha
 Like an independent ruler, he introduced a coin in his name
 iske baad bijapur ke sultan ne konkan vijay ke liye apane do senadhishon ko shivaji ke viruddh bheja par ve asafal rahe
 In 1677–78, Shivaji's attention shifted to Karnataka
 bombay ke dakshin main konkan, tungabhadra nadi ke pashchim main belgaum tathaa dharwar kaa kshetra, mysore, vailari, trichur tathaa zinji par adhikaar karne ke baad 4 april, 1680 ko shivaji kaa dehant ho gaya
 Shivaji died on 3 April 1680 after three weeks of illness
 us samay shivaji ke uttaradhikaar sambhaji ko mili
 Shivaji had the eldest son Sambhaji and a second son named Rajaram from his consort
 us samay rajaraam kii umr maatr 10 varsh thi atah maraathon ne shambhaji ko raja maan liya
 Seeing the demise of Aurangzeb King Shivaji at that time, with the desire to rule his whole India, he went out to conquer South India with his 500,000 army
 aurangzeb ne dakshin main atehi adilshaahi 2 dino main ore qutubashhi 1 hi dino main khatam kar di
 But the Marathas, under the leadership of King Sambhaji, maintained their independence while fighting for 9 years
 aurangzeb ke putr shahjada akbar ne aurangzeb ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Sambhaji gave him shelter in his place
 aurangzeb ne ab phir joardaar tareeke se sambhaji ke kilaaf akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Finally, in 1689, Sambhaji's wife's brother, Sambhaji, by the mouth of Ganji Shirke, made Sambhaji a prisoner by Mukarav Khan
 aurangzeb ne raja sambhaji se badasluki kii or bura haal kar ke maar diya
 Seeing his king being mistreated by Aurangzeb and badly hit, the Pura Maratha Swarajya became angry
 unhone apni puri takat se teesraa rajaraam ke netritv main mughalon se sangharsh jari rakhaa
 Rajaram died in 1700 AD
 uske baad rajaraam kii patni tarabai 4 varshiya putr shivaji dwitiya kii sangrakshika banakar raaj karti rahi
 Ultimately 25 years of tired Maratha war fighting of the kingdom was buried in the self-rule of Shivaji, the same chhatrapati of Aurangzeb
 shivaji ko ek kushal or prabud samraat ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Although he did not get much traditional education in his childhood, he was familiar with Indian history and politics
 unhone shukracharya tathaa kautilya ko adarsh maanakar kootneeti kaa sahaara lenaa kai baar uchit samajha tha
 Like his contemporary Mughals, he was also an autocratic ruler, that is, the entire reins of governance were in the hands of the king
 par unke prashaskeey kaaryon main madad ke liye aath mantriyon kii ek parishad thi jinhen ashtapradhan kaha jaataa tha
 In this, the head of the ministers was called Peshwa, who was the most prominent figure after the king

 Shivaji used to call himself the Sardeshmukh of the Marathas and in this capacity, Sardeshmukhi tax was collected
 rajbhishek ke baad unhone apane ek mantri ko shaskeey upyog main aane vaale farsi shabdon ke liye upyukt sanskrit shabd nirmit karne kaa kaary saunpa
 Ramchandra Amatya, with the help of a scholar named Dhundhiraja, composed a book called 'rajyavarthakosh'
 is kosh main 1380 farsi ke prashasnic shabdon ke tulya sanskrit shabd the
 Ramchandra has written in it- shivaji ek samarpit hindu the tathaa vah dharmik sahishnu bhi the
 Muslims had religious freedom in their empire
 kai masjidon ke nirmaan ke liye shivaji ne anudaan diya
 Like Hindu Pandits, Muslim saints and fakirs were also respected
 unki sena main musalmaan sainik bhi the
 Shivaji used to promote Hindu culture
 parmparik hindu mulyon tathaa shiksha par bal diya jaataa tha
 He also started his campaigns often on the occasion of Dussehra
 shivaji maharaj ko apane pita se swaraj kii shiksha hi mili jab bijapur ke sultan ne shahji raaje ko bandi bana liya to ek adarsh putr kii tarah unhone bijapur ke shah se sandhi kar shahji raaje ko chhudvaa liya
 This brings a generous element to his character
 usek baad unhone pita kii hatya nahin karwaai jaisaa ki anya samraat kiya karte the
 He got his coronation only after the death of Shahaji Raje, although by that time he had become independent of his father and became the ruler of a large empire
 unke netritv ko sab log sweekaar karte the yahi kaaran he ki unke shasankaal main koi aantarik vidroh jaisi pramukh ghatana nahin hui thi
 He was also a good diplomat with a good commander
 kai jagahon par unhone sidhe yuddh ladane kii bajaay yuddh se bhaag liya tha
 But this was his diplomacy, which always supported him in defeating the biggest enemy
 shivaji maharaj kii "ganimi kawa" naamak kootneeti, jisamen shatru par achaanak akraman karke use haraaya jaataa he, vilobhaniyata se or aadarsahit yaad kiya jaataa he
 These lines are famous in Shivaji Maharaj's pride- helmand afghanistan kaa ek praant he jo us desh ke dakshin-pashchimi bhaag main sthit he
 The area of this province is 58,584 sq km and its population was estimated to be around 14
4 lakhs in 2006
 helmand ke lagbhag 90% log pashtun samudaay ke hai
 The capital of this province is Lashkar Gah city
 vaise to yah ilaaka registani he lekin helmand nadi yahan se nikalati he or uskaa pani fasalon ke liye bahut laabhadaayak hota he
 It is also a major center for illegal opium production and 75% of the world's opium is produced here
 helmand nadi pracheen kaal se hi is kshetra main kheti-baadi ke liye pani kaa anmol saadhan rahi he
 Therefore, there have been countless dams on it for thousands of years
 band or pul ke liye pracheen farsi main 'hetu' shabd istemaal hota tha jo sanskrit ke 'sethu' shabd kaa sajaateey shabd he
 Just like him, another Persian word is 'dim' means one who has something
 is nadi kaa pracheen farsi naam hetumand tha yani 'bahut baandhon vaali nadi'
 yah naam samay ke saath badalakar helmand or hirmand ban gaya
 Buddhism and Hinduism were prevalent in Helmand region

 It is also believed that Khwariji was a part of the group
 laqin ibaadiyon kaa kahana or maananaa he ki unka khwarigiyon se koi sambandh nahin he, kintu "muhakkima" samooh se taluk he
 In linguistics, the study of word-form based on the structural unit of morphology is called pedology or morphology
 duusare shabdon main, 'shabd' ko 'pad' main badalane kii prakriya ke adhyayan ko rupavigyaan kaha jaataa he
 Morphology is a major part of linguistics
 iske antargat pad ke vibhinn anshon - mul prakruti tathaa upsarg, pratyay, vibhakti - kaa samyak vishleshan kiya jaataa he isaliye katipay bhartiya bhashashastriyon ne padvigyaan ko "prakruti-pratyay-vichaar" kaa naam bhi diya he
 In the grammar of language, pedagogy has a special importance
 vyakaran / bhashavigyaani vaakyon kaa varnan karata he or yah varnan yathasambhav purna or laghu ho, iske liye vah padon kii kalpana karata he
 Therefore, he has been called the incumbent
 padon se chalakar hi ham vaakyarth or vaakyoccharan tak pahunchate hai
 "to make the right division of a language right means to have complete knowledge of the grammar of that language"
 rup ke adhyayan kii drushti ke aadhaar par rupavigyaan ke vibhinn prakaar ginaae gaye hai- Indian masters have given two conditions of words - Siddha and Imperfect
 inamen "asiddh" shabd ko keval "shabd" tathaa "siddh" shabd ko "pad" ke rup main parinat kiya jaataa he
 The Sumbat and Tirta of "siddhi" and many distinctions of "imperfect" have been discerned
 yahan tak ki sanskrit kaa prayek shabd "dhaatuj" tehraaya gaya he
 The nomenclature of grammar and its definition has been made keeping in mind the same process, viz
, Vrānusāsana and "vyakryante vivikyante shabda: anen iti grammar
" " paashchaatya vidvan dhaatvansh ko aavashyak nahin maanate, ve aadhaar roopaanshon ko naam evam aakhyaat donon ke liye alag alag sweekaar karte hai
 In fact, many languages do not require corroboration
 is prakaar roopaanshon kii paribhaasha paashchaatya vidvan bluemfield or naida ke anusaar shabd "bhashaa kii arthpurna laghutam ikai" he
 It can be divided into base plurals and relation plots
 unhen kram se bhashaa ke arthtatv evam sambandhtatv kah sakate hai
 There are mainly three forms of reciprocal relations of Arthaattva and Kinshipatva
 ek sanyukt jahaan donon abhinn rup ho jate hai, doosraa ishat sanyukt yaa ardhasanyukt; isamen donon ko pruthak pruthak pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 The third isolate, where both express their meaning separately
 sanyukt rup ke antargat pracheen arya, sami hami aadi bhashaaon kii gananaa kii gai he
 The basic nature of it changes
 greek prathama ek
 bouse, san
 go:, greek pu
dwi
 jugon, san
, yugma sanskrit purlig pan
ek
 agne:, arabi qitl, katl, kaatil, qutil aadi
 In separate form, the relation has a separate existence
 aadhunik arya, chini aadi bhashaayen isi koti kii hai
 The example of Sanskrit Avvaya, the modern Aryan languages are examples of this
 yatha san
 iti evam, c aadi, hindi ko, se, kaa, kii, ke, main par or, jab, aadi
 Such grammatical words in Chinese are called blank or meaningless
 yatha- tsi, mu, sung 
 The relation of form is also related to tone or stress
 chini, africa bhashaaon main is udhaaharan kii bahulata he
 English Conduct, Conduct, Huo Chinese
 iske antargat shabdakram bhi sambandhroop ko prakat karata he
 For example, gin, jint ngotan nittanmo - you kill me
 is sabandhatatvon ke dwaara bhashaa kii vibhinn vyakarnatmak dhaaraon kaa nirdhaaran hota he
 With this, expression of gender, speech, factor, man, call, question, prohibition etc
 is possible in the language
 bhashashastriyon ke matanusaar in sabhi vyakarnatmak dhaaraon kaa prayog bhashaa ke uttarottar vikaas ke saath saath hua
 The relationship between the words used in a sentence is determined by the expressions
 pracheen aryabhashaon main aath vibhaktiyaan thim jinke ab keval avikari or vikari, do hi rup shesh milte hai
 Wiktionary does not have the capability of automatic use
 uske saath parasarg ke yoga se sabandh prakat hota he
 
 vibhinn kaarksbandhon ke spashtikaran ke liye bhashaa main parasarg va pripozishan kaa vikaas hua
 In this way, the old grammatical streams in the language keep on decreasing and new streams continue to fill this gap
 hindi kii kriyaaon main bhi lingabhed miltaa he
 This trend is not found in other modern Aryan languages
 hindi main lingaprayog sambandhi yah vishesh vyakaranik dhara he
 These subtle streams of language differ from each other
 isiliye ek bhashaa kaa duusari bhashaa main anuwaad karnaa saral kaary nahin hota
 It is clear from the above discussion that grammatical clauses are not natural and rational
 inkaa vikaas sthulata se sookshmata kii ore hua he
 On this basis, it has also been concluded that underdeveloped languages are indicative of gross and developed subtle forms
 drushti kendriya tantrika tantra kaa bhaag he
 It provides the ability to receive optical signals, process them and perform actions or reactions based on them
 drushti kaa manushya ke jivan main bahut bada mahatv he
 It is not only a means of direct knowledge of the substances around, but also affects the mental and physical health of humans
 nimna jati ke kasherukadandiyon se lekar vanaragan tak ke vikaas main aankh ke vishram kii sthiti parshv disha se kuch hatakar lagbhag lalatdisha main aa gai
 The eye and eyeball moved forward
 netrakotor aankhon kii apeksha kam khiske
 Initially the use of eyes was self-preservation and later they became more used in attacking
 is prakaar vikaas kii avasthaa main vanaragan ko dwinetri drushti kii prapti hui
 The only way to produce a mental effect through the coordinated use of both eyes is binocular vision
 jin pashuon kii ankhen sir par agal bagal hoti hai, unki aankhon ke drushtikshetra alag alag hote hai
 Therefore, their vision is monogamous, that is, they have to suppress the images of the other eye to see with one eye
 janm ke samay ankhen ek duusare se sambhddha nahin hotin, varan do swatantra gyanendriyon ke samaan rahati hai
 The mechanical organs required for binoculars do not develop intermittently
 gartikas teen maheene baad utpann hoti hai
 As soon as they develop, there is a system of stimulation to relate these areas
 pareekshan or chook kii vidhi se, kisi padaarth ke bimb ko donon gartikaon par ek saath laane par, bimb kaa atyant spasht hona baccha jaanane lagata he
 The axons are then positioned in such a way that each socket is directed towards the visual material, and the child learns to articulate simultaneously from both maculae
 iske baad kii avasthaa main ek drushti utpann karne ke liye donon antarakshiyon ke bimb samekti hote hai or samekan sahajakriya ban jaataa he
 If the eyes cannot be connected for some reason, such as the development of a socket or a column of external axes, then both sockets are unable to focus simultaneously on the visual material and the child is unable to integrate the two images
 in paristhitiyon main drushti sadaa ekanetri or praaia: prayavarti bhi hoti he, yaa bimb aspasht hota he
 The third order of binocular vision is depth perception, ie the sense of depth, or the third dimension of perception
 yah sthiti manovaigyanik tathaa anya prakriyaaon se hoti he
 There is a lateral distance between the two eyes, due to which the images of the two eyes are not congruent, the images of one eye are tilted to the left and the other eye to the right
 gaharaai pratyakshkaran ke aavashyak shaareerik or manovaigyanik kaarak manushya main janm se hote hai, yaa janm ke baad sheeghra hi viksit ho jate hai
 Therefore, if the formation of the eye and the steering muscle is normal, then the direct knowledge of depth is automatically
 aankhon kaa vartan yaa drushti kii spashtataa drushtipatal par bane hue bimb kii spashtataa par nirbhar hoti he
 For this, the camera-like eye of photography has an organ related to optics, which follows the general rules of optics
 paardarshak swachhmandal, netrod, netra lens or kachabh drav aankh ke prakashkeey tantra ke pradhan ang hai
 The innermost sensitive eyebrow of the eye, ie retina, represents the camera's photography-palette
 nilamban snaayu ubhayottal lens ko apane sthaan par sthir rakhti hai, jinke dwaara yah romabh peshiyon se judaa hota he
 The rays coming from matter pass through the hygienic, ophthalmic and lens and are focused backwards by the lens
 swat: samaayojan ke kaaran lens kii uttaltaa adhik yaa kam ho sakati he evam drushtipatal par kirnon ke focus hone par spasht, vaastavik, chota or ulta bimb banataa he
 The retina consists of a layer of nerve epithelium, which consists of ligaments and cones
 shanku pradhanat: macula par ekatra hote hai or dand parima par
 These are highly differentiated cells and act as a visual antidote
 anya samvedi tantrikaon ke samaan in antyagon ke uddipan main bhi samvedi aavegon kaa vikaas hota he, jo kendriya tantrika tantra ke abhivahi kshetra se hoti hui mastishk main pahunchati hai
 The first real vascular nerve cell, or first-class neuron, is a bipolar cell in the inner nucleus layer, whose axon is in the inner plexus
 drushtipatal kii gucchhika koshikaaye dwitiya shrenee kii neuron hai, jinaki prakriyaayein tantrika reshe kii parat main paarit hoti hai or drushtitantrika, drushtiswastik or drushtikshetra se hoti hui parshv vakrapind main jaati hai
 Here a new cell - the third-tier neuron - transports impulses and travels through the impulse axialization to the vulva of the occipital segment, also called the vision
 samooche drushtipatal main macula kaa kshetra sabase mahatvapurn or spasht tathaa tikshnata ke liye uttaradaayi he
 The technique of vision or when light falls on the retina, then stimulates a sensory nerve antigen
 jis prakaar twachaa se kisi vastu kaa sampark hone se sparshasamvedan hota he
 Changes resulting from appropriate stimulation in a normal tactile nerve, physical impulses from sensory nerves and psychological impulses to these impulses in the brain are straightforward
 drushti ke tantrikatantr main ye prakriyaayein atyant jatil or vibhedit yani alag-alag hai
 The light on the retina produces mechanical, photochemical and electrical responses
 yantric parivartanon main shanku chote ho jate hai or shadbhujakar koshikaon main ranjak dravya apni prakriyaayein aarambh karte hai
 The visible niluron present in the cones and penises is blurred and becomes a type of photograph, or retina, of the luminous substance
 ant main, drushtipatal ke vidyudvibhav main parivartan bhi hone lagata he
 When light stimulates the retina, there are three types of sensing: photosensitization, varnosection and morphology
 prakashbodh vah antarnihit shakti he, jisase ham prakaash kii newnaadhik sabhi prakaar kii tivrataon kaa anubhav kar pate hai
 Punishment is more sensitive to low brilliance than cones, which is why we see punishment from evening time
 ratrichar pashuon ke drushtipatal main kam shanku hote hai, yaa bilkul nahin hote
 This is the second inherent power, which gives us direct knowledge of the external world
 isamen shankuon kaa kaarybhag adhik he or isliye macula par, jahaan shanku ghaney or vibhedit hote hai, rupasamvedan bahut hi teevr hota he
 That is the inherent power, which allows us to distinguish between different colors and shadows
 is shakti kaa thik thik anunsadhan karnaa atyant kathin he, kyonki varnakram ke alag alag rangon kii deeptiyaan alag alag hoti hai
 Therefore, this obstructive factor should be associated with the somatic conditions of the retina, such as its adaptation stage, etc
 ye teenon pratyaksh gyaan kendriya yaa maculiay drushti ke atyant chote pradesh tak hi simit nahin hai
 They are also very few in the peripheral parts of the retina
 netrapariksha main in teenon pratyaksh gyaanon kii tikshnata kii jaanch kii jaati he
 The sharpness of central central vision is often tested with the test types of Snellen, which are 60, 36, 24, 18, 12, 9 and 6 m rows
 saamaanya vyakti ko chah meter duuri par sthit, chah meter pankti ke aksharon ko aarambh se ant tak pard lene main kathinaayee nahin honi chahie
 If this distance has to be reduced then the vision of the person is considered
 antim do deeptiyon kaa mahatv adhik he, kyonki inke her pher se drushtitikshnata kaa pathan badal jaataa he or isiilie 100 foot kii maanak duuri ko variyata di jaati he
 a test of the patient's myopia is also necessary
 yah aavashyak nahin he ki jisaki duuradrushti saamaanya ho uski nikat drushti bhi saamaanya ho, yaa saamaanya nikat drushtiwale kii dur drushti bhi saamaanya ho
 Jager is checked by near-test types to score J1, J1
 yah parvat ke samaan he, jiske chaaron ore andhata kaa samudr ho
 The centerpiece represents the visual axis
 vibhinn akritiyon ke shwet padaarthon tathaa nile, laal, pile, hare rang ke padaarthon ko lekar kshetra kaa pareekshan kiya jaataa he
 There is a facility to diagnose diseases of the fundus and light path by the examination of the area

 mandir kii prashasnic sanrachana main sheersh par ek mukhya kaaryakari adhikari hota he, jo rajya sarkaar aadesh nishpadit karata he
 Apart from this, the temple also has one Deputy Chief Executive Officer, two osds, one Executive Officer, Account Officer, one Temple Officer and a Publicity Officer to assist the Chief Executive Officer
 haalanki badrinaath uttar bharat main sthit he, parantu phir bhi mandir ke rawal yaa mukhya pujari paramparaagat rup se dakshin bhartiya rajya kerala se chune gaye nambudiri brahman hi hote hai
