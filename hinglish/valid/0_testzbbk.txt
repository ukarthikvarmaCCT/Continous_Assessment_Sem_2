 Theoretical roots that underlie stone creation can be traced to Greek philosophy
 baad main elchemist ne shastreey tatwon, anima mundi kii avadharana or plato kii timius jaise granthon main prastut kii gai rachana kahaniyon kaa upyog apni prakriya ke anuroop ke rup main kiya
 According to Plato, the four elements are derived from a common source or prima materia associated with chaos
 prima materia naamak alchimist bhi darshanik ke pathar ke nirmaan ke liye praarambhik ghatak ko aavantit karte hai
 The importance of this philosophical first case continued throughout the history of alchemy
 satrahavin shatabdi main, thomas won likhte hai, "pathar kaa pehla maamla sabhi chizon ke pehle maamle ke saath samaan he
 " madhya yug The 8th-century Muslim alchemist Zabir ibn Hayyan analyzed each classical element in terms of four fundamental properties
 aag garm or sukhi, prithvi thanda or sookhaa, pani thanda or nam, or hawa garm or nam donon tha
 He theorized that each metal was a combination of these four principles, two of them internal and two external
 is aadhaar par, yah tark diya gaya tha ki ek dhaatu ke duusare main transmishan apane mul gunon ke punargathan se prabhavit ho saktaa he
 This change would presumably be mediated by a substance, called al-ixir in Arabic
 ise aksar ek sookshm pathar-darshanik pathar se bane sookhe laal powder ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Jabir's theory was based on the concept that metals such as gold and silver can be concealed in alloys and ores from which they can be recovered by proper chemical treatment
 jabir khud ko ekua rejiya kaa avishkaarak mana jaataa he, murietic or nitric acid kaa mishran, kuch padaarthon main se ek jo sone ko bhang kar saktaa he 
 In the 11th century, there was a debate among Muslim world chemists about whether transmission of substances was possible
 ek pramukh pratidwandvi farsi bahulak avisena tha, jinhone padaarthon ke transmishan ke siddhant ko asweekaar kar diya tha, "rasinic shilp ke un logon ko acchhee tarah pataa he ki padaarthon kii vibhinn prajatiyon main koi badlaav nahin ho saktaa he, haalanki ve utpaadan kar sakate hai is tarah ke parivartan kii upasthiti

 Magnus does not confirm that he discovered the stone in his writing, but he does record that he saw the creation of gold by "transmission" aadhunik avadhi ke liye punarjagran The Square Circle: An Alchemical Symbol The philosopher's stone symbol indicates the interaction of the four elements of matter 16 veen shatabdi ke swiss elchemist paracelsus ne sarvashaktimaan ke astitv main vishwaas kiya, jise unhone ek andekha tatv mana, jisase anya sabhi tatv bas vyutpann rup the
 Paracelsus believed that this element was, in fact, the philosopher's stone

 Each human has a Huntingtin gene, which is encoded for the Huntingtin protein
 is jin kaa ek ansh trinucliotide aavriti naamak aavriti anubhag he, jisaki lambaai prayek vyakti main alag hoti he or pidiyon ke bich lambaai main parivartan ho saktaa he
 When the length of this iterated section reaches a certain threshold, this mutant produces a transformed form of the protein called the Huntington protein
 in proteinon ke bhinn kaary hi rogaatmak parivartanon ke kaaran hote hai, jo badale main rog ke lakshan paidaa karte hai
 Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost completely ingrained: mutation of one of the HTT genes of an individual causes the disease
 yah ling ke anusaar nahin, balki jin ke punrarit bhaag kii lambaai ke anusaar vanshaagat hota he or isaki gambhirtha kaa bhi yahi kaaran he, prabhavit mata-pita ke ling se prerit kiya ja saktaa he
 HD is one of several trinucleotide frequency disorders, resulting from the length of the iterated portion of a gene over normal extension
 HTT jin 4p16
3 par gunasutra 4 kii choti bhujaa par sthit hota he
 HTT consists of a sequence of three DNA bases - cytosine – adenine – guonine – which is repeated several times, called a trinucleotide frequency
 CAG amino acid glutmine kaa anuvanshik kuta he, at: inaki ek shrinkhalaa poliglutomine path naamak glutmine kii shrinkhalaa or jin ke punrarit ansh, polyq bhaag kaa utpaadan karata he
 Generally, people have less than 36 repetitive glutamines in the polyq region that results in the production of the cytoplasmic protein Huntington
 tathaapi, 36 yaa adhik glutmine kii shrinkhalaa ke parinamswaroop ek aise protein kaa nirmaan hota he jisaki visheshtaayen alag hoti hai
 This altered type, called mhtt, increases the decay rate of some neurons
 mastishk ke hisson main is prakaar ke neuronon kii vibhinn maatra or nirbharta rahati he or tadnusaar ye prabhavit hote hai
 In general, the number of CAG recurrences depends on how much this process has been affected and causes variation in the onset of symptoms by about 60%
 shesh vividhta ke liye parivesh or HD kriyavidhi ko badalane vaale anya jin ko uttaradaayi tehraaya jaataa he
 36–40 recurrence results in a less-intrusive form of the disease, with late onset and slow progression of symptoms

 It accounts for about 7% of HD carriers
 hantington rog main alingsutri prabal anuvanshikta he, yani prabhavit vyakti vishesh rup se apane mata yaa pita se vistrut trinucliotide aavriti sahit jin kii ek prati praapt karata he
 Since the mutation is very high, a person with a mutant copy of the gene suffers from the disease

 Trinucleotide CAG frequencies greater than 28 are unbalanced during replication and this imbalance increases with the number of repetitions present
 yah praayah trinucliotide aavriti kii sateek prati utpann karne ke bajaay, pidiyon ke guzarane ke saath-saath nae vistaar kii ore agrasar hota he
 This causes a change in the number of repetitions over successive generations in such a way that an unfree mother or father with an "intermediate" number, or "low penetrance", can carry forward a copy of the gene, including an increase in the number of repetitions that produce fully intrusive HD

 Several pathways have been identified by which mhtt can cause cell death
 iname shaamil hai: sangrakshika protein par prabhaav, jo protein ko bikharane or bikhare hue protein ko hataane main sahaayak hote hai; kaspases ke saath antalakriya, jo koshikaon ko hataane kii prakriya main bhoomika nibhaate hai; tantrika koshikaon par glutmine kaa vishakt prabhaav; koshikaon ke bheetar urjotpaadan kii kshati; or jin ke prakaton par prabhaav
 res naamak protein ke saath antalakriya ke kaaran mhtt kaa koshikaon par vishakt prabhaav badi majbootee se badhataahain, jo mukhyatah striatum main prakat hota he
 The race was found to induce the sumoylation of mhtt, which breaks down the protein nodules — cell culture studies have shown that nodules are less toxic than uncultured ones
 ek atirikt siddhant ke anusaar, jo HD dwaara koshika ke kaaryon ko baadhit karne ke tareeke ko samajhaata he, stretiatal koshikaon main mitocondria kii kshati or neuron main kai protein ke saath hantingtin protein kii antalakriya, glutmine kii atisamvedansheeltaa ko badhaava detii he, jo bahut adhik maatra main, excitotoxin ke rup main pai gai
 Excitotoxin can damage many cellular structures
 haalanki glutmine atyadhik ucch maatra main nahin pai gai, tathaapi yah mana gaya he ki vardhit atisamvedansheeltaa ke kaaran, glutmine kii saamaanya maatra bhi excitotoxin utpann kar sakati he
 In addition, increases in sensitivity dependence on capases are activated by frequency expansion of polyglutamine and increased sensitivity
 hantingtin protein, capases dwaara chote tukdon main cheer di jaati he; ye parmaanu samucchy, pratilekhan ko, neuron ke nabhik main "daakhil" hote hue, protein ke nirmaan main dakhal dekar baadhit karte hai
 Unfortunately, cellular stress caused by interference promotes further breakdown of the Huntingtin until apoptosis occurs
 HD mastishk ke vishisht kshetron ko prabhavit karata he
 The most prominent initial effect is on parts of the basal ganglia called the neostriatum and which are formed from the caudate nucleus and shell
 anya prabhavit kshetron main shaamil hai shyaam dravya, pramastishkeey valk kii teesri, paanchavi or chhathi parat, hippocampus, anumastishk main purakinje koshikaayen, adhakashchetak kii parshvik nalaakaar nabhik or chetak ke hisse
 ye apane bheetar shaamil neuron or apni sanrachana ke hisaab se prabhavit hote hai, jaise-jaise ve koshikaayen khote jate hai unka aakaar chota hota jaataa he
 In these regions, they are one of the neuron types affected and according to their structure, reducing in size as they lose cells
 strietal kantedaar neuron sabase asurakshit hai, visheshkar bahya globas palids kii ore jhukaav vaale, jinke antahneuron or bhitari pelidam par jhuki kantedaar koshikaayen kam prabhavit hoti hai
 HD also causes abnormal growth in astrocytes
 aadhaarik gandika-hd dwaara sarvaadhik pramukhataa se prabhavit mastishk kaa bhaag-gati or vyavahaarparak niyantran main ahm bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Their functions have not been fully understood, but existing theories propose that they are part of the cognitive executive system and motor circuits
 aadhaarik gandika aam taur par un paripathon ko baadhit karti he jo vishisht gati utpann karte hai
 To initiate a specific movement, the cerebral external structure sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the barrier to be released
 aadhaarik gandika ko pahunchi kshati nishedh kii rihaai tathaa punarsthapana ko aniyamit or aniyantrit kar sakati he, jo chaal kii ajeeb shuruyaat yaa anjaane main chaal kii shuruyaat yaa apane nirdisht samaapan ke pehle yaa baad main gati ko roak saktaa he
 The total damage that is being done in this area leads to the fictitious casual movements associated with HD
 aadhaarik gandika ko do prakaar se kshatigrast kiya ja saktaa he: pratyaksh or paroksh rup se
 sidhe maarg main, kam neurotransmitron ko aantarik globas paleads bheje jate hai, jo ise avrodh main kami ke rup main samavisht kar lete he, jiske dwaara saamaanya se adhik neurotransmeter mukt hote hai
 The thalamus, which receives innumerable neurotransmitters, becomes inhibited and thus sends fewer neurotransmitters to the motor cortex
 antat, gatijanak praantastha kam uttejit hoti he or gati saamaanya se kam hoti he
 The indirect pathway begins by the external globus pallidus receiving fewer neurotransmitters and, in turn, decreases response as the low resistance signal releases more neurotransmitters
 upchetak nabhik, jo bahya globas paleads se sanket praapt karata he, IGP ko, praapt adhik neurotransmeter ke badale kam neurotransmeter jari karata he
 Now IGP is quite inhibitory because the function of STN is to stimulate IGP and therefore IGP releases fewer neurotransmitters
 is sandarbh main, chetak dwaara kam neurotransmeter abhigrahan ko kam avrodh mana jaataa he
 Finally, the motile cortex receives more neurotransmitters and becomes over stimulated, causing jerky movements, which is common in Korea
 kyonki straayetum main do bhinn prakaar ke neuron hote hai, ek bhinn prakaar kaa neuron, jo alag tantrikaksh or parshvatantu se lakshith hota he, prayek maarg main uttejit hota he or is prakaar donon ek saath chal sakate hai
 Usually the indirect pathway is affected first, causing chorea as one of the first symptoms, but eventually, both types of neuron die and the speed is greatly limited
 creb-badhyakaari protein, ek pratilekhan kaarak, koshikaon ke kaary karne ke liye mahatvapurn he, kyonki sah-utprerak ke rup main pravartakon kii sarthak sankhya main yah astitv maarg ke liye jin kaa pratilekhan shuru karte hai
 In addition, the amino acids that make up CBP include a strip 18 glutamine
 is prakaar, CBP par glutmine sidhe Htt shrinkhalaa par vardhit sankhya ke saath glutmine se antalakriya karata he or CBP apni nabhik ke paas kii aam sthiti se hataa diya jaataa he
 In particular, the CRB includes an asyltransferase workspace, which demonstrated in an experiment by Stephan and colleagues that Htt exon 1 binds to this domain with 51 glutamines in CBP
 un vyaktiyon ke autopsi kiye gaye mastishkon main bhi, jinhen hantington rog tha, CBP kii avishwasaneey maatra pai gai
 Additionally, when CBP is more manifest, polyglutamine-induced deaths are lower, further indicating that CBP plays an important role in Huntington's disease and neuron in general
 HD ke prarambh hone kaa chikitsiya nidaan, rog ke vishesh shaareerik lakshanon ke prakat hone ke pashchaat kiya ja saktaa he
 If no history of HD is available in the family, genetic testing can be used to confirm the physical diagnosis
 rogalakshanon ke prarambh hone se pehle bhi, anuvanshik pareekshan yah pushti kar saktaa he ki koi vyakti yaa bhrun, rog utpann karne vaale HTT jin main trinucliotide punrariti kii ek vistaarit prati kaa vahan kar rahaa he yaa nahin

 These implications include the attitude of the individual, career, family planning decisions, effects on relatives and relationships
 Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of people at hereditary risk of HD prefer to undergo the test

 Genetic testing for HD involves a blood test that counts the number of CAG iterations of each HTT allele
 ek anukool parinaam ko nidaan nahin mana jaataa he, kyonki ise rogalakshanon kii shuruuaat se dashakon pehle hi praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 However, a negative test means that the individual does not bear the expanded copy of the gene and HD will not develop

 The main rationale presented for choosing a test for HD is to provide support in life expectancy and family decisions
 HD vanshaagat jokhim vaale 95% se adhik vyakti pareekshan nahin karavaate hai, adhikanshtah isliye koi ilaaj maujuud nahin he
 An important issue is the anxiety experienced by the individual, which is related to the lack of information about the likelihood of them eventually developing HD, compared to the effect of a positive result
 parinaamon kaa lihaaj kiye bina, pareekshan ke do varshon baad tanaav str pehle se kam paae gaye hai, lekin anukool jaanch parinaam ke baad aatmahatya kaa jokhim bad jaataa he

 This technique, in which a single cell is extracted from embryos containing 4 to 8 cells and then examined for genetic abnormality, can later be used to ensure that embryos carrying the affected HTT gene are implanted
 If not done and this disease will not be able to enter any child
 Prenatal diagnosis of the fetus or developing fetus in the uterus is also possible

 Until the discovery of genetic testing, the data could only include clinical diagnoses based on physical symptoms, family history of HD, excluding those who died of any other causes before symptoms appeared
 These cases can now be included in the data, and as testing becomes more widely available, estimates of prevalence and the likelihood of the disorder are likely to increase

 The strong inheritance pattern prompted many researchers to try and locate family members involved in previous studies, one of which was Smith Eli Jelliffe
 Jelliffe collected information from all over New York State and published several articles regarding the HD lineage in New England
 Jelliffe's research aroused interest in his college friend Charles Davenport, who hired Elizabeth Monkey to present the first field studies of families with HD off the east coast of the United States and build their genealogy

 This view has not been substantiated and, for example, there is some evidence to the contrary that the family community studied by George Huntington freely accommodated those who exhibited symptoms of HD

 When HDF was formed, around the same time, Marjorie Guthrie helped set up a committee to deal with Huntington's disease following the death of her husband Woody Guthrie with HD problems
 Since then, support and research organizations have been formed in many countries around the world, which have helped to raise public awareness of HD
 inamen se anek, antarrashtriya hantington sanstha or euro HD network jaise sanghathanon ke saath sahyog karte hai
 Many aid organizations hold annual HD awareness programs, some of which are supported by their respective governments

 To reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies (or more), some countries have imposed limits on the number of embryos to be transferred, but these limits are not followed or accepted at all locations
 There is a spontaneous division of embryos in the uterus after transfer, but it is very rare and it gives birth to identical identical twins

 The study concluded that a virtually unique ranking would be personalized to the needs of each prospective student
 National publications have accepted the value of rankings against various criteria and now offer a differently ordered list: by salary, GMAT marks of students, selectivity, etc
 Although useful, these rankings are still not tailored to individual needs and, their value is reduced if they use an incomplete school population, to differentiate between the different postgraduate program types in different business arrangements provided by each school Be optimistic, or rely on subjective interviews

 Often, with the encouragement of the king and the feudal lords, scholars were attracted to their meetings and settled mostly in their capital, making them a center of city education
 inamen takshashila, patliputra, kanyakubj, mithila, dhara, tanjor aadi prasiddh hai
 Similarly, scholars were also attracted towards pilgrimage centers

 Sometimes only four students studied under a guru
 atev unke bhojan va nivas kii vyavastha karnaa guru ke liye koi kathin kaary nahin hota tha
 But being unable to manage the students of the Guru, the students used to manage their stay themselves

 The Guru could not refuse to teach even a poor student from poor

 Such teachers were called unfit for Ritwik's work on religious occasions

 Therefore, it became necessary for the students to go to places remote from the family and study the desired subjects under the patronage of eminent scholars
 praaia: kanyaon ko bhi ucch shiksha praapt karne ke liye ghar ke baahar vidvan aacharyon ke paas janaa padataa tha
 But in this regard, very few clues are received from our texts
 uttarramcharita main valmiki ke ashram main lav-kush ke saath padhane vaali aatreyi naamak stri kaa ullekh hua he
 Which is a strong proof that co-education was propagated in that era
 isi prakaar `malti-madhav' main bhi bhawabhooti ne bhurivasu evam devraat ke saath kaamandaki naamak stri ke ek hi paathshaala main shiksha praapt karne kaa varnan kiya he
 Bhavabhuti is an eighth century poet
 atev aisa prathit hota he ki yadi bhawabhooti ke samay main nahin to unase kuch samay purv tak balak-balikaon kii sah-shiksha kaa prachlan avashya rahaa hoga
 Similarly, Puranas narrate the stories of Kahod and Sujata, Ruhu and Pramadvara
 inase gyaat hota he ki kanyaayein baalkon ke saath-saath paathshaalaon main padhati thim tathaa unka vivaah yuvati ho jane par hota tha
 As a result, Gandharvas were sometimes married
 ye samast pramaan is tathy par prakaash daalate hai ki us yug main striyaan bina parde ke purushon ke bich rah kar gyaan kii prapti kar sakati thim
 The existence of the co-education system in that era is also proved by them
 gurukulon main sahashiksha kaa prachaar tha, is dharna kaa samarthan aashvalyan grih sasutra main var nit samaavartan sanskaar kii vidhi se bhi miltaa he
 In this method, in the description of the follow-up action of the graduate, the embalming rites of the child and the girl are found to be completed simultaneously
 us yug main stri ke brahmacharyashram, vedadhyayan tathaa samaavartan sanskaar kaa auchity aashvalyan ke matanusaar pramanit ho jaataa he
 In the past, when a large number of women were getting higher education and increasing their pride of literature by making their invaluable contribution, some of them must have done teaching work at that time
 sanskrit sahitya main upaadhyaaya evam upaadhyaayani shabdon kaa prayog paaya jaataa he
 Upadhyaya's wife has been reverently named Upadhyayani, but Upadhyaya has been used for the male students who used to do teaching work
 mahila shikshikaaon kaa bodh karaane vaale ek anya shabd kii rachana karne kii aavashyaktaa padana tabhi sambhav rahaa hoga jabaki mahila shikshikaaye paryaapt sankhya main rahi hon
 Apart from this, the pradapratha came into Indian society after the twelfth century, so there was no possibility of any kind of bonding in teaching work for women
 ho saktaa he ye upaadhyaayaayen keval kanyaon ko hi padhaati rahi hon athwa balak-balikaon donon ko
 Panini has also explained the difference between Acharya and Acharyani and has mentioned the schools
 isse bhi anumaan lagaaya ja saktaa he ki aacharyaayein in chatrishalaon kii sangrakshi-kaayen bhi hoti hongi
 Ramdas Goud has written - `` After the Harsha, the teaching work of women is also found in the seventh-eighth century
 shankaracharya se haar jane ke falswaroop apane pati mandan mishra ke sanyas le lene par ubhaybharti shringgiri main adhyaapan kaary karne lagi thi
 It is said that it was due to Bharati's education that the disciple of the monasteries of Shringeri and Dwarka became known as 'bharati'
 kintu phir bhi sthaan kii kami evam asuvidhaon ke kaaran adhikansh kanyaayein ghar par hi padhati hongi tathaa ucch shiksha praapt karne kaa saahas na kar paati hongi
 Probably, this is the reason why more details are not available in respect of these hostels and academics
 yadhyapi is kaal main maitreyi, gargi, vishwavaara evam lila-vati ke samaan ucch shiksha praapt mahilaayein thi, kintu isse yah nishkarsh nahin nikaala ja saktaa ki is yug main stri shiksha kaa paryaapt prachlan tha athwa stri-shiksha apane sangathit rup main vidyaman thi
 In this regard, L
 mukarji ke anusaar--`yah sambhav he ki is yug main striyon ke liye shiksha kii koi sangathit vyavastha nahin thim
 Probably when eligible degrees are received in the society, then the girls will be sent under their protection, but due to their not being available, they have to be forced to send daughters to the Acharyas to study
 jis kaal main gandharv vivaah samaaj main asaamaanya na tha, sahashiksha main kanyaon ke abhibhavakon ko koi aapatti bhi na rahi hogi
 But later, due to Gandharva marriage, the fear of moral degradation of girls started increasing
 atev log ghar par hi shikshak niyukt karke kanyaon kii ucch shiksha-diksha kaa prabandh karne lage
 The number of girls going to remote masters for higher education would not have been very high because there is no mention of girls going to Taxila for education
 isa kii chauthi shatabdi tak ladakon ke liye bhi saarvajanik paathshaalas na thim
 Harit has arranged that girls should be educated at home by father, uncle or brother
 isi prakaar manu bhi kanyaon ko purush shikshakon ke sarankshan main rakhkar ladakon ke saath adhyayan karne ke liye ghar se baahar bhejne ke paksh main nahin hai, kyonki sah-shaksha se kanyaon kaa kausaryatv nasht hone kii ashanka bad jaati he
 Buddhists have the credit for making the first organized effort for women education
 buddha ne sangh main naariyon ke pravesh kii anumati de di thi
 The Buddhists had also made a satisfactory system of education for the nuns living in the Viharas
 brahmavadiniyon ke samaan inamen se bahut-si naariyon ne dharm or darshan gyaan ke liye brahmacharya paalan kiya
 Some of these also went to Sinhala country and gained special fame as great teachers of Buddhism there
 in viharon main ye naariyaan sahashiksha hi grahan karatin thim
 But even in these Buddhist sanghas, there was a complete decline of female education around the fourth century CE
 kitni pratishat chatraayen sahashiksha grahan karti hogi, is prashn kaa nishchit rup se koi uttar nahin diya ja saktaa
 But surely this number would not have been much
 vartmaan main vaidic shiksha ko badhaava dene ke liye baba ramdev ne acharyakulam kii sthapana kii he
 Baba Ramdev's purpose behind the establishment of Acharyakulam is to promote Vedic and Indian education
 acharyakulam gurukul paddati par aadhaarit gurukul shiksha ke saath-saath aadhunik shiksha paddati kaa ek awasaiya shaikshanik santhaan he, jo bharat desh ke uttarakhand rajya ke haridwar main sthit he
 Its most special thing is that till the 8th, 50 percent Vedic and 50 percent CBSE courses are taught here
 iske baad 8 veen ke 25 pratishat vaidic or 75 pratishat sibiesai kaa silebus hota he
 It is also the first school where English is taught to students as much as Sanskrit
 Recently Acharyakulam is associated with CBSE Board
 acharyakulam main aadhunik or vaidic shiksha kaa adbhut sangam dekhne ko miltaa he, yahaan ensiiarti ke paathyakram ke alaava teen period vaidic shiksha ke hote hai
 In this, knowledge of Vedas, Upanishads, Sanskrit, Yoga, havan-pujan etc
 is given
 pracheen bhartiya shiksha kaa itihaas sahasron varshon kii lambi avadhi main likhaa gaya he
 Therefore, it is very large
 smritiyaan sanskrit sahitya main parivartansheel ek vishisht kaal kii ore sanket karti hai
 Through him, a series of literary works from Vedic period to his own period have been foreshadowed
 atev smritikalin vidhyaarthiyon ke adhyayanarth vedon, brahmanon, upanishdon evam sutron ke kaal kii samast mukhya rachanaayen thim
 By the fifteen hundred BCE century, the work of editing most of the Vedic mantras was completed
 tatpashchaat vedon ke arth-bodh ke liye jin tikaatmak evam charchaatmak granthon kaa vikaas hua ve `brahman' granthon ke naam se pratishthit hue
 The genius of the scholars of this period was used to protect the nature of the Vedas and to clarify the meanings, not in the representation of new literary works
 falat: vaidic yagyon se sambandh anek siddhanton, matvaadon or ritiyon kaa vivechan `brahmanon' main hone laga
 Scholars especially made the ritual of yagyas the center of their spiritual practice
 parinaam swaroop karmkandon main jatilta evam duruhata aa gayi
 On the other hand the philosophical tendency of the Vedas developed and attained perfection as the 'upanishads'
 kalanukram se vedatirikt sahitya main bhi prachur vruddhi hui
 As a result, mastery in this continuous Vardhaman literature became beyond the ability of one person alone
 us kaal main mudran kala kaa vikaas nahin hua tha
 Therefore, the fear of the disappearance of Vedic literature was always there
 sahitya-suraksha ke drushtikon se adhyayan kshetra ko do bhaagon main vibhajit kar diya gaya
 Some of the Vedic pundits were entrusted with the task of making this huge literature as it is, thereby keeping the pure nature of literature intact and by studying the commentaries of other scholars, commentaries and dictionaries, etc
 An opportunity to show their talent in interpreting it
 Given
 is kaal main hindu megha kii sabase adhak nirnayaatmak evam rachanaatmak pratibha kaa pradurbhaav hua
 As a result, significant successes were achieved in the fields of education, philosophy, justice, epics, linguistics, grammar, astrology, nirukta, kalpa, many arts, practical learning etc
 in granthon ke vidwaanon ne apane vidhyaartheeyon kii sugamawa ke liye in vishyon kaa navinikaran karte hue unhen sakshep main ekatri t kar diya
 They were not written even though the Upanishads and sutras had knowledge of writing arts during the period, because scripting Vedic mantras was considered irreligious
 isi kaal main vaidic charnon ke aadhaaron par vidwaanon ne dharmasutron main ek naveen sahitya kii rachana bhi kar daali
 In view of the changing history of Sanskrit-poetry mentioned above, we can easily estimate its diversity and vastness
 smritiyon main is samast baiumay main varnit saamaajik ritiyon, dharmik karmkandon, evam sanskaron kaa surveykshan kiya gaya he
 In fact, memories have been created by targeting a large society
 smriti granthon main ham isi sahitya ke ullekh kii aashaa bhi rakhte hai
 Therefore, it has compiled pre-existing best practices, customs, beliefs and rites in the Grihyasutras, Dharmasutras, Upanishads and Mimamsas
 is kaary main jitani safalataa manusmriti ne praapt kii hai utani anya kisi smriti ne nahin
 Hence, only the subjects indicated in Manu Smriti are being mentioned here
 manu ne teenon vedon ko shruti kaha he
 These three Vedas are the first link in Sanskrit literature
 vaidic mantron kaa vikaas charnon ke rup main hua jinaki vaanchit shakhaon kaa gyaan purohit varg avashya praapt karata tha
 Mantra, Brahmin, 'rigvedi' reading the branch; The recipients of the Vedas, the 'ritviz', the scholar of all branches, and the learned Brahmin who passed through the Vedas, received special honors
 jo brahman teen vedon ke gyaata hote the unhen 'trivedi' kaha jaataa tha
 Some of the chiefs of the Vedas have been specially passed for study in Manusmriti
 vastut: is kaal tak dharmik kriyaaon env praayshchiton dwaara shuddhikaran kii prakriyaaon main atyant vistaar ho gaya tha
 Therefore, on certain occasions, the importance of the pronunciation of some of the verses of the Vedas also increased
 manu smriti main aisi richaon kaa ullekh karte hue kaha gaya he ki inkaa uccharan purna santulan evam niyam ke saath hona chahie jisase paapon se mukti paayi ja sake
 The Brahmins used the Angiras Shruti of the Atharvaveda as weapons to destroy the enemy
 snaatakon ke pratidin ke swadhyay paath main brahman granthon ke adhyayan kaa protsaahan diya gaya he
 Manu also mentions the mantras called 'subrahmanya' of Aitareya Brahmin and the Shunashep saga mentioned in Aitareya Brahmana and Bahru Brahma Brahmana

 Here is the sequence of writing: newzealand kaa rajtantr, newzealand kii sanvaidhanik rajtantr he
 The monarchy of New Zealand has the distinction of being the sole sovereign sovereign of 15 nations, including New Zealand and the United Kingdom
 vartmaan satta-vidyaman shaasha, 6 farvari varsh 1952 se maharani elizabeth dwitiya hai
 New Zealand's political system, like other Commonwealth countries, is based on the Westminster system, in which the position of head of state is nominal, and the real administrative powers are vested at the head of state
 newzealand saidhantik rup se ek rajtantr he, or newzealand ke shaasha ke padaadhikari iske rashtrapramukh hote hai, haalaanki shaasha kii sari sanvaidhanik shaktiyon kaa abhyaas, unke pratinidhi ke rup main, newzealand ke governor-general karte hai

 newzealand main rajtantr kii aitihaasik prishthbhumi, british aupniveshikta main he, jab 18veen sadi main britain ne apane samrajya kaa vistaar kiya or vishwa ke vibhinn konon main apane upnivesh sthapit kiya
 Gradually these colonies were given sovereignty over their administration, and by the Statute of Westminster, 1931 all these states were given full equal status within the Commonwealth
 jo purv upnivesh, british shaasha ko aaj bhi apana shaasha maanate he, un deshon ko rashtramandal prajabhumi yaa rashtramandal pradesh kaha jaataa he
 As the prominent parallel heads of many of these nations, the British academies also find themselves with the title of head of the Commonwealth
 haalanki shaasha ko aam taurapar british shaasha ke naam se hi sambodhit kiya jaataa he, parantu saiddhanthik taur par saare rashtron kaa samprabhu par saamaan adhikaar he, tathaa rashtramandal ke tamaam desh ek-dusre se purnatah swatantra or swytt hai

 Generally, individuals from the UK to whom His / Her Majesty or His / Her Royal Highness is referred to are generally considered members of the royal family
 rajpariwaar main keval samprabhu ko hi sanvaidhanik kartavya va pad praapt hai
 The sovereign and his immediate family members carry out various official, ceremonial and representational functions of the country

 This obligation was imposed by the Statute of Westminster, 1931
 singhasana par uttaradhikaar, vibhinn aitihaasik sanvidhion dwaara anushaasit he
 Historically, succession has been disciplined by the doctrine of male-dominant consanguineous primacy, in which sons have been given priority over eldest daughters, and eldest offspring of the same sex are given first priority

 At a Commonwealth meeting in 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that all Commonwealth territories had agreed to end the male preference tradition, and also to revoke future rulers from prohibiting Catholics from marrying Catholic individuals
 Everyone's approval was obtained

 The bill received royal assent on 23 April 2013, and came into force on March 2015 after the passage of the relevant legislation in all Commonwealth territories
 singhasana kaa koi uttaradhikari, swechha se apana uttaradhikaar tyaag nahin kar saktaa he

 Therefore, like other Commonwealth subjects, it is a parliamentary monarchy
