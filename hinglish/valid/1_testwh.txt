 In the late 19th and early to mid-20th century, the Congress became a central partner in the Indian freedom struggle, with more than 1
5 crore members and more than 70 million participants, opposing British colonial rule
 1947 main aazaadee ke baad, congress bharat kii pramukh raajnneetik party ban gai
 Out of 16 general elections from independence to 2016, Congress has won an absolute majority in 6 and led the ruling coalition in 4; Hence, she was a part of the Central Government for a total of 49 years
 bharat main, congress ke saat pradhanmantri rah chuke hai; pehle jawaharlal nehru the or haal hi main manmohan singh the

 Swaraj's goal in Congress was first adopted by Bal Gangadhar Tilak
 praarambhik varsh In 1907, two parties were formed in the Congress - the hot party and the soft party

 After the outbreak of the First World War, at the Lucknow meeting of 1916, the two parties reunited and the Home Rule Movement was started, under which the British Raj demanded an official position for India
 congress ek jan andolan ke rup main But with Gandhiji's arrival in India in 1915, there was a big change in the Congress

 Nehru / Shastri era indira yug Rajiv Gandhi and Rao era aadhunik yug The Congress is a civil nationalist party that follows a form of nationalism, which supports values such as freedom, tolerance, equality and individual rights
 congress ek party ne hokar ek vichaardhaara he From time to time, various leaders opposed the policies of the Congress and struggled to remove it

 271872 plate vivartaniki ek vaigyanik siddhanth he jo prithvi ke sthalmandal main bade paimaane par hone vaali gatiyon kii vyakhya prastut karata he
 It also attempts to explain the construction of surface relief in the form of continents, oceans and mountains, and the geographical distribution of events such as earthquakes and volcanoes
 yah siddhanth beesvin shatabdi ke pratham dashak main abhikalpit mahadwipiya visthaapan naamak sankalpana se viksit hua jab 1960 ke dashak main aise naveen saakshyon kii khoj hui jinase mahadwipon ke sthir hone kii bajaay gatisheel hone kii avadharana ko bal mila
 The most important of these evidences is the evidence related to pauperism which confirmed the Sagar Nital diffusion

 According to this theory, the upper layer of the earth, about 80 to 100 km thick, which is called Sthalmandal, and which includes the earth's crust and the upper part of the earth's crust, is broken into several pieces called plates
 ye platen neeche sthit asthenosphere kii ardhapighalit parat par tair raheen hai or saamanyatya lagbhag 10-40 mimi / varsh kii gati se gatisheel hai haalaanki inamen kuch kii gati 160 mimi / varsh bhi he
 The movement of these plates presents an explanation of the origin and mountain formation of the earth's present surface pattern and it has been observed that often earthquakes fall on the boundaries of these plates and volcanoes are also found along these plate boundaries

 Generally, the number of large plates in these plates is considered seven
 iske alaava kuch majhale or chote aakaar kii plates bhi hai
 a list of these is given below: kuch vidwaan uttari america plate or dakshini america plate ko ek hi maanate hue badi platon kii sankhya chah manaate hai
 There are many variations in the number of small plates, but their number is generally accepted more than 100

 That is, some people believed that the size of the Earth was reduced by contraction after the origin and as a result of this contraction the forces on the surface of the earth are located and the twists are located in the form of mountains
 europe main sarvapratham austrian edward swess ne is tarah kii sankalpana ko prachaarit kiya tha
 On the contrary, some believed that the continents have moved horizontally and due to the collision, the force in the upper surface has created mountains

 It was only in the early sixteenth century that scholars marked the similarity of the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean to each other

 Later American geographer FB Taylor spoke of a kind of flow of continents by the gravitational force of the moon in 1908–10, and also attributed it to the origin of the Tertiary era mountains
 par unki baat par kisi ne bahut dhyaan nahin diya
 Wagner, who was an archaeologist and archaeologist, proposed the idea that the distribution of climate in ancient times could be interpreted if the continents were to be considered dynamic and he proposed the theory of continental displacement in 1912 which His book, published in 1915, was published in Origins of Continents and Oceans

 And continental displacement platon kii gatishiltaa ke kaaran inke ke kinare yaa simaayen teen prakaar ke paae jate hai: With this type of edge, the two plates move towards each other and collide them and the heavy plate is injected under the light plate
 mudakar neeche kii ore kshepit hone vaala yah hissaa gaharaai main ja kar taap or daab kii adhikta ke kaaran pighalkar megma main parivartit hota he
 The depth at which this event occurs is known as the tiller zone or Benioff zone
 aise kinaaron ke sahare bhusannatiyon ke padaarth dabaav ke kaaran mudakar parvaton kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Going down, the molten material rises up as a magma plume and also produces volcanism
 jahaan do platen ek duusare ke vipareet gatisheel hoti hai, arthath ek duusare se dur hatati hai vahaan neeche se megma upar uthakar nayi plate kaa nirmaan karata he
 The most prominent landforms found on these banks are the Central Oceanic Ridge
 jab yah kinaaraa kisi mahadweep par sthit hota he to rift ghaatiyon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Due to the construction of new plate, it is also called creative edge
 sangrakshi kinaaraa vah he jiske sahare do plate ek duusare ko ragadate hue gatisheel hon, arthath na to apsaran ho rahaa ho na hi abhisaran
 Normally, rubbing each other using this edge moves in opposite directions, but it is not mandatory, if two plates move in the same direction and their motion is different, they can still form a protective edge by rubbing their edges
 inke sahare transform bhransh paae jate hai
 Since neither the plate nor the destruction is formed, they are called protective / protective edges where the status quo is preserved in the context of construction / destruction
 plate vivartaniki siddhant valit parvaton ke nirmaan kii sabase nayi vyakhya prastut karata he
 For example, a description of the origin of the mountains of the Alpine mountain system can be presented
 is siddhant ke anusaar yah mana jaataa he ki bumadhya sagar ke uttari or dakshini ore bane parvaton kii shrunkhlaayen tershiri yug main hue vivartanik ghatnaon kaa parinaam hai jinamein tethes sagar main jamaa avsaadon ke africa or europea platon ke bich sampeden dwaara inkaa nirmaan hua
 Regarding the origin of the Himalayas, this theory holds that the origin of this range is due to the approaching of the Tibet Plate and the Indian Plate and the compression of sediments deposited in the Tethys Sagar or Bhusannati
 jiner diod ek prakaar kaa diod he jo ek saadhaaran diod kii tarah bijli ko aage kii disha main bahane kii hi nahin balki yadi voltage, brakedown voltage se, jise "jiner ni voltage" yaa "jener voltage" bhi kaha jaataa he, zyada hua to ulti disha main bhi bahane kii anumatideta he
 The device is named after Clarence Jenner, who discovered this electrical property
 ek paaramparik thos-avasthaa vaala diod paryaapt bijli kii anumati nahin degaa yadi vah reverse brakedown voltage se neeche reverse-biked he
 When the reverse-biased breakdown voltage increases, a conventional diode is subjected to high power due to avalanche breakdown
 yadi yah vidyut pravaah bahya paripathakaar dwaara simit nahin kiya jaataa, to yah diod sthaayee rup se kshatigrast ho jaataa he
 In the case of a large forward bias, the diode exhibits a drop in voltage due to its junction gap voltage and internal resistance
 voltage kii giravat kii raashi, ardhchaalak padaarth or doping sandratha par nirbhar karti he
 a Zener diode exhibits almost the same properties, except that the device is designed for reduced dissolved voltages, the so-called Zener voltages
 a Zener diode contains a large number of doped pn junctions that allow electrons to tunnel from the combination band of the p-class material to the conduction band of the n-class material
 parmaanu paimaane main, yah tanneling, sangyojan band electron ke khaali chaalan band sthiti main antaran se mail rakhata he; isaki vajah he, in bandon ke bich ghatit baadha or ucch bijli kshetra jo donon taraf ke apekshaakrit ucch str kii doping se prerit hota he
 a reverse-biased Zener diode exhibits a controlled breakdown and allows electricity to keep the voltage across the Zener diode at a Zener voltage
 For example, if a reverse-biased voltage higher than the Zener voltage is used, a The diode whose Zener drop voltage is 3
2V will exhibit a 3
2 v voltage drop
 haalanki, bijli aseemit nahin he, isliye jiner diod ko aamtaur par ek pravardhak charan ke liye ek sandarbh voltage utpann karne yaa kam-bijli anuprayogon ke liye ek voltage stabliser ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa he
 The damping voltage can be controlled quite accurately by the doping process
 jabaki kshamta 0
05% ke bheetar uplabdh he, sabase adhik vyapak rup se istemaal kii jane vaali kshamta 5% or 10% he
 Another mechanism, which produces similar effects, is the avalanche effect, as in avalanche diodes, in fact both types of diodes are created in the same way and both effects are present in such diodes
 5
6 volt tak ke silicon diod main jiner prabhaav ek praadhanya prabhaav he or ek chihnit pratikul taapmaana gunank dikhaata he
 Above 5
6 volts, the damping effect prevails and exhibits a positive temperature coefficient
 ek 5
6 diod main, do prabhaav ek saath hote hai or unke taapmaana gunank bade suvyavasthit dhang se ek duusare ko radd kar dete hai isliye 5
6 v diod taapmaana sambandhit mahatvapurn anuprayogon main pasandida ghatak he
 Modern manufacturing techniques have produced devices with a voltage coefficient of negligible temperature below 5
6 V, but the temperature coefficient increases impressively when high voltage devices are encountered
 ek 75V ke diod main 12V ke diod ke gunank se 10 guna zyada he
 All such diodes are commonly marketed under the name of Zener diodes, regardless of their breakdown voltage
 jiner diod kaa vyapak rup se prayog ek circuit main voltage ko niyantrit rakhane ke liye kiya jaataa he
 To reverse-bias the Zener diode when the voltage reaches the reverse breakdown voltage of the diode when it is connected in parallel with the source of a variable voltage
 us bindu se vah voltage ko usee mulya par rakhata he
 The resistor r in this shown circuit provides a voltage drop between UIN and UOUT
 r ke mulya ko do niyamon ko puraa karnaa chahie: Can be as high as K
 r kii gananaa karte vaqt, sampoorn UOUT main jode gaye bahari lod ke madhyam se kisi bhi curent ko chhot di jaani chahie, is chitra main nahin dikhaaya gaya he
 These devices are also encountered, typically in the transistor stage with the base-emitter junction as a series, where selective devices centered at the depolarization / zener point operate the temperature coefficient equilibrium compensation at the PN junction of the transistor
 can be applied

 parantu yah dhyaan yogya he ki mastaani ke khilaaf peshwa parivaar dwaara jo gharelu yuddh chhidaa tha, usamen kashibai ne koi bhoomika nahin nibhaai
 Historian Pandurang Balakavade says that various historical documents suggest that Kashibai was ready to accept Mastani as Bajirao's second wife, but this could not happen due to opposition from her mother-in-law Radhabai and brother-in-law Chimaji Appa
 18veen sadi ke roodhiwaadee bharat kii kai mahilaon kii tarah unhen mahatvapurn maamalon main koi bhi dakhal dene ki anumati nahin thi

 But Nanasaheb sent his mother Kashibai instead
 kaha jaataa he ki kashibai ne bajirao kii mrityushyya par ek vafaadaar or kartavya parayan patni banakar unki seva kii he or unka vivaran pati ko atyadhik samarpit bataaya gaya he
 He and his son Janardan cremated Bajirao
 bajirao kii maut ke baad 1740 main mastaani kaa bhi nidhan ho gaya or kashibai ne unke putr shamsher bahadur pratham kaa khyaal rakhaa or unhen hathiyaaron main prashikshan dene kii suvidha di
 She became more religious after her husband's death

 Although ornithiscian dinosaurs are part of the hip structure of modern birds, birds are thought to have originated from the saurischian dinosaurs and therefore develop their hip structure independently
 In fact, a bird-like hip structure is a strange group of theropods of Therizinosauridae This is the third time they have developed among them

 Freud was the eldest of his seven siblings
 3 saal kii umr main frid ke pita lipjig aa gaye or uske ek saal baad vienna chale gaye, jahaan ve kareeb 80 saalon tak rahe
 Freud did his Doctor of Medicine in 1881 from the University of Vienna

 He died in London in September 1939
 unnisvin sadi ke armbh ke kuch samay pehle manovigyaan ek swatantra vigyaan ke rup main viksit hua
 Earlier, psychology was studied under philosophy
 us vakt manovigyaan kaa uddeshy vayask maanav kii chetana kaa vishleshan or adhyayan karnaa tha
 Freud opposed this traditional "psychology of consciousness" and proposed many new psychoanalytic concepts on which our modern psychology rests
 frid ke praarambhik jivan ko dekhne par ham pate hai ki armbh se hi unka jhukaav tantrika vigyaan kii ore tha
 Between 1873 and 1881, he got in touch with the then famous neurologist Ernst Brucki
 frid, ernest bruki se prabhavit hue or unki prayogshaala main kaary prarambh kiya
 After publishing several research papers in physiology and neuroscience, Freud separated from Ernst Brookey and started his private business as a physician
 san 1881 main frid ne vienna vishvavidhyalay se em
di kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 Shortly before this, Freud had contact with Joseph Brewer
 frid ne joseph briuvar ke saath shodhpatr "studies in histyria" likhaa
 "studies in hysteria" was based on the analysis of a patient, whose fictitious name was "anna O"
 yah mana jaataa he ki isi shodhpatr main manovishleshanvaad ke beej chhipe hue the
 This research became very famous
 san 1896 main briuvar tathaa frid main peshewar asahmati hui or ve alag ho gayi
 1900 was the most important year in Freud's life
 isi varsh unki bahucharchit pustak "interpratation of dream" kaa prakaashan hua, jo unke or unke rogiyon ke swapnon ke vishleshan ke aadhaar par likhi gai thi
 In this, he told that dreams are a reflection of our unquenchable desires
 is pustak ne unhen prasiddh bana diya
 Many contemporary intellectuals and psychologists were attracted to him
 inamen karl jung, alfred edler, oto rank or sandoor francji ke naam pramukh he
 Freud had a good contact with all these people, but later there were differences and people separated from them
 san 1909 main clark vishwa vidhyalay ke mashhoor manovigyaani ji
es
 haal dwaara frid ko manovishleshan par vyaakhyaan dene kaa nimantran praapt hua, jo unki prasiddhi main mile kaa pathar sabit hua
 isamen frid ke alaava yung, vril, jones, ferenkaji tathaa kai anya mashhoor manovigyaani upasthit the
 Freud soon returned from here, because he did not like the atmosphere of America
 Here Freud was complaining of stomach upset, which he attributed to various American foods
 jung or edler, frid ke manovishleshanvaad ke kai binduon se sahamat the
 But he rejected Freud's excessive emphasis on sex
 isse alag-alag samay main ve donon bhi inase alag ho gaye
 Jung emphasized the interference of cultural heritage in psychoanalysis and Adler emphasized sociality
 yadhyapi yah sahi he kii peshewar sahakarmi unase ek-ek kar alag ho rahe the phir bhi unki prasiddhi ko isse koi fark nahi padaa
 In 1923, cancer was detected in Freud's mouth, due to which he was told to drink more cigars than necessary
 san 1933 main hitler ne germany kii satta par kabza kar liya
 He clearly stated that he has no place in the power for Freud's suit
 hitler ne frid kii sari pustakon or hastlipiyon ko jala diya
 He probably would have behaved even worse, but after political pressure and the intervention of the then American ambassador, Hitler forcefully signed a paper asking Freud not to misbehave with him
 iske baad unhen vienna chhodkar landan jane kaa aadesh diya
 He received a grand reception in London
 unhen turant hi royal socity kaa sadsy bana liya gaya
 Here he published his last book "moses and Monethism"
 frid ne man yaa vyaktitv ke swarup ko gatyaatmak mana he
 According to him personality is the name of our brain and body functions
 frid ke maansik tatv hote hai jo chetan main nahin aa pate yaa sammohan athwa chetana lop kii sthiti main chetan main aate hai
 It contains the wishes related to childhood, sexual desires and mental conflicts, etc
, which the person himself does not even know
 inhen saamanytah vyakti apane pratidin kii jindagi main puraa nahi kar paata or ye vikrut rup dhaaran karke yaa to sapanom ke rup main yaa phir unmaad ke daure ke rup main vyakti ke saamne upasthit hoti hai
 According to Freud, the dynamic side of personality is formed by three stages - idan kii utpati manushya ke janm ke saath hi ho jaati he
 Freud considered it to be the most important part of the personality
 isaki vishaywastu ve icchhaaen hai jo libdo se sambandhit hai or taatkaalik santushti chaahati hai
 The growth of energy is not able to bear it and if it does not get expression properly then it affects the person by wearing a distorted form
 aham frid ke liye swa-chetana kii tarah thi jise usne maanav ke vyavhaar kaa dwitiyak niamak bataaya
 It is an organized part of IDE, its purpose is to pursue the goals of IDE
 para aham ek prakaar kaa vyavhaar pratimaanak hota he, jisase naitik vyavhaar niojit hote hai
 It develops relatively late
 frid ke vyaktitv sambandhi vichaaron ko manolangik vikaas kaa siddhant bhi kaha jaataa he
 Freud divided it into 5 stages - inhi ke aadhaar par usne vivaadaaspad electra or odipus complex kii avadharana di jiske anusaar shishu kii langik shakti prarambh main khud ke liye prabhavi hoti he, jo dhire -dhire duusare vyaktion kii ore unmukh hoti he
 That is why sons are more attracted towards mother and daughter more towards father
 iske kaaran ladakon main mata ke prati prem or pita ke prati pratidwandita utpann hoti he, jise frid dwaara odipus complex kaa naam diya
 This has been a very controversial and popular concept
 frid in sankalpanaaon kii satyata sabit karne ke liye aankade nahi de paae
 un par aalochakon ne yah aarope lagaaya kii unhone apane anubhavon ko in prekshanon ke saath mishrit kiya he or jo kuch bhi unke rogiyon ne kaha us par unhone aankh band kar vishwaas kiya he
 Freud also faced accusations that he was over-imagining psychology and mixing mythological texts, giving sexual needs more space than necessary
 frid ke kaary or un par aadhaarit unki manyataon ke dekhne par ham yah pate hai ki frid ne maanav kii pashavik pravriti par zarurat se adhik bal daalaa tha
 He made it clear that many of the qualities and characteristics of inferior animals are also seen in humans
 unke dwaara paribhaashit mul pravriti kii sankalpana bhi iske antargat aati he
 Freud was of the opinion that no change can be brought about in the nature of an adult person because the foundation of his personality is found in childhood, which cannot be changed in any way
 However, later research has proved that humans are fundamentally future oriented
 ek shaikshik manovigyaani ke samaan frid ke manovigyaan main krambaddhata nahin dikhaai detii parantu unhone manovigyaan ko ek nai paribhaasha di jiske aadhaar par ham aadhunik manovishleshanatmak manovigyaan ko khadaa pate hai or tamaam aalochanaon ke baad bhi asaamaanya manovigyaan or naidanik manovigyaan main frid ke yogadan ko andekha nahi kiya ja sakaata
 The cult of psychoanalysis propounded by Freud was very popular due to its popularity
 Freud wrote several books, among which "inter pretation of Dreams", "group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego", "totem and Taboo" and "civilizations and Its Discontents" are prominent

 When a heavy body is tied to a rope, and it is seen holding the rope by immersing a heavy body in the water, it is seen that not much force is applied, as much force is exerted by pulling that body out of the water
 aisa kyon hota he iskaa kaaran sabase pehle ganitagya archimedies ne gyaat kiya or is siddhant kaa pratipaadan kiya ki kisi drav main duube hue pind par drav ek urdhwadhar utkshepi bal lagaataa he, jo pind dwaara visthapit drav ke bhaar ke baraabar hota he
 The concept of fluid pressure comes to the fore when diagnosing entrapment, that is, a force that the liquid exerts on each surface of the body in contact with itself
 aise daab ke astitv kaa abhas hamen yahi dekhakar mil jaataa he ki chhidr se baahar nikalate hue pani ko rokane ke liye bal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Archimedes' law can be interpreted based on the hypothesis that liquid pressure acts perpendicularly to the surface of the body in contact with the liquid
 daab kii sankalpana main spashtataa laane ke liye dabprachandta kii paribhaasha yah kah kar kii gai he ki yah taral dwaara lagaae hue bal or tal ke kshetrafal ke anupaat kii seemaa he, jab kshetrafal shunya kii ore agrasar hota he
 An important advantage of the concept of intensity is that its value can be determined at each point of the liquid
 yah siddh kiya ja saktaa he ki taral ke kisi bindu par sabhi dishaao main dabprachandta kaa maan baraabar rahata he or ise us bindu par dravasthaitik daav kehete hai
 Abbreviations denote this by P
 is daab kaa aayam bal prati ekak kshetrafal he
 It can also be proved that if the density of the fluid is constant, the pressure is proportional to the depth and remains the same in the horizontal plane
 is siddhant ke anusaar hi - 'khojahi dadak sadaa nij str'
 This property is used in water management and also the well follicles are able to run for the same reason
 iske aadhaar par leonardo di vinchi ne taral daab kii sancharanshiltaa kaa yah niyam pratipaadit kiya ki yadi bina jyamitiya parisimayen badale drav ke kis bindu par daab main koi vruddhi kar di jaae to utani hi vruddhi drav ke prayek vindu par swat: ho jaati he
 Due to the magnitude of the force being equal to the pressure and the product of the area, applying a small force on a small area is the same as applying a larger force on a piston of a larger area
 jalchaalit daavak, brake aadi isi niyam par aadhaarit hai
 For this reason, the dams are made wider at the base than the top, and those working at extreme depths in water have to wear steel armor to protect against pressure
 drav kaa mukt tal or amishry taralon ke bich kaa tal, donon kshaitij hote hai
 In other words --- the perpendicular force exerted by the liquid on the surface unit area of a plane is called liquid pressure

 paddati main maatrak newton / me2 hota he !jise pascal bhi kehete he! tathaa PA se pridarshit karte he!iskaa vimiya sutara ML—1T—2 hota he ! When a body is partially submerged into several liquids, its load is balanced by the equal charges of the load of the different fluid displaced by the body and each thrust is placed in the vertical direction at the center of gravity of the amount called the buoyancy center
 may be considered
 yadi kisi plavit pind ko aisi vibhinn sthitiyaan di jaane, jin main uske dwaara visthapit dravon kaa bhaar ke baraabar rahe, to utplavak centre kaa bindupath utplavak tal kehalaata he or santulanavastha main pind kii vah sthiti hoti he jisamen utplavak centre or pind ke gurutvakentre ke bich kii duuri mahattam yaa nunatam hoti he
 The balance is temporary when the maximum distance is and permanent when it is minimum
 utplavkatal ke mukhya vakratakendron ko aplav centre kehete hai
 If the gravity center of the body in the subplot center is above c, then the equilibrium for the main displacements corresponding to m is permanent, if below, temporary and if c and m are the same point, the equilibrium is neutral
 ga m utplavan tal par abhilamb hoti he
 In this way, the equilibrium conditions can be determined by pulling the capacitance at the buoyancy plane from c
