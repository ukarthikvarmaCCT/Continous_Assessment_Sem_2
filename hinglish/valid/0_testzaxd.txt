 Wheat and barley grains have been found in the cracks of the floor

 Two-room barracks have also been found in Harappa which were probably meant for laborers to live
 kalibangan main bhi nagar ke dakshin bhaag main eenton ke chabutare bane hai jo shaayad kothaaron ke liye bane honge
 Thus it is clear that Kothar was an integral part of the Harappan culture
 hadappa samskruti ke nagaron main eent kaa istemaal ek vishesh baat he, kyonki isi samay ke misr ke bhawanon main dhoop main sukhi eent kaa hi prayog hua tha
 The use of concrete bricks is found in contemporary Mesopatamia, but not on such a scale as in the Indus Valley Civilization
 mohan jodado kii jal nikaas pranali adbhut thi
 Almost every big or small house in every city had a courtyard and bath
 kalibangan ke anek gharon main apane-apane kuen the
 The water of the houses flowed to the streets where peacocks were made under them
 aksar ye moriyaan eenton or pathar kii silliyon se dhakin hoti thim
 In these peacocks of roads, softeners were also made
 sadakon or moriyon ke avshesh banaavali main bhi mili hai
 The economy of the Indus civilization was agrarian, but trade and animal husbandry were also in vogue
 aaj ke mukaable sindhu pradesh purv main bahut upjau tha
 In the fourth century BC, a historian of Sikandar said that Sindh was counted in the fertile regions of this country
 purv kaal main prakritik vanaspati bahut thim jiske kaaran yahaan acchhee varsha hoti thi
 The wood was used extensively for cooking bricks and building from the forests here, due to which the expansion of forests was gradually reduced
 sindhu kii urvartaa kaa ek kaaran sindhu nadi se prativarsh aane vaali baadh bhi thi
 a paved brick wall to protect the village indicates that floods used to come every year
 yahaan ke log baadh ke utar jane ke baad november ke maheene main baadh vaale maidaanon main beej bo dete the or agali baadh ke aane se pehle april ke maheene main gehun or jau kii fasal kaat lete the
 No shovel or fall has been found here, but from the prakrit-harappan civilization of Kalibangan, we have the impression that plows were plowed in Rajasthan during this period
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log genhu, jau, rai, matar, jowar aadi anaaj paidaa karte the
 They produced two varieties of wheat
 banaavali main mila jau unnat kism kaa he

 The work of making bead and amulets was also popular, yet no iron item has been found
 atah siddh hota he ki inhen lohe kaa gyaan nahin tha
 People here used to trade stones, metal scales etc
 among themselves
 ek bade bhubhag main dher sari sil, ekarup lipi or manakikrut maap taul ke pramaan mili hai
 He was familiar with the wheel and probably used a vehicle similar to today's aces

 They established a commercial colony in northern Afghanistan that facilitated trade
 bahut si harappai sil mesopotamia main mili hai jinase lagata he ki mesopotamia se bhi unka vyapaar sambandh tha
 Evidences of trade with Meluha have been found in the records of Mesopotamia, as well as two intermediate trade centers - Dalmun and Maken
 dilamun kii pahchaan shaayad faras kii khadi ke bahrain ke kii ja sakati he
 It is clear that Harappa's developed city building system, the existence of large public baths and the trade relations with foreign countries would not have happened without any big political power, but there is no concrete evidence of how the rulers here were and what was the form of governance
 
 lekin nagar vyavastha ko dekhakar lagata he ki koi nagar nigam jaisi sthaneey swashaasan vaali sanstha thi
 Female statues of burnt clay have been found in Harappa in large numbers
 ek murti main stri ke garbh se nikalataa ek paudha dikhaaya gaya he
 According to scholars, it is a statue of the earth goddess and it must have been closely related to the birth and growth of plants
 isliye maaloom hota he ki yahaan ke log dharti ko urvartaa kii devi samajhate the or isaki puja usee tarah karte the jis tarah misr ke log nil nadi kii devi isis kii
 But like ancient Egypt, it is difficult to say whether the society here was also mother-dominated
 kuch vaidic sookhton main prithvi mata kii stuti he, dholavira ke durg main ek kuan mila he isamen neeche kii taraf jaati seedhiyaan he or usamen ek khidki thi jaha deepak jalaane ke saboot milte he
 The water of Saraswati river used to come in that well, so perhaps the people of Indus Valley used to worship Saraswati through that well
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke nagaron main ek sil paaya jaataa he jisamen ek yogi kaa chitra he 3 yaa 4 mukh vaala, kai vidwaan maanate he ki yah yogi shiv he
 Mewar, which was once in the range of Indus Valley Civilization, is still worshiped here, Eklinganath ji, the incarnation of Shiva with four faces
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log apane shavon ko jalaayaa karte the, mohan jodado or hadappa jaise nagaron kii aabaadi kareeb 50 hazaar thi par phir bhi vahaan se keval 100 ke aasapaas hi kabre mili he jo is baat kii or ishaara karata he ve shav jalaate the
 Havan blunts have been found at Lothal, Kalibanga etc
, which is a proof of their being Vedic

 Archaeologists have found the remains of many temples in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia but no temple has been found in the Indus Valley till date, Marshall etc
 Many historians believe that the people of Indus Valley used to worship in their homes, fields or river banks, but Till date, only the Brihatnasan or the huge bathhouse is such a monument which is considered a place of worship
 jaise aaj hindu ganga main nahaane jate he vaise hi saindhav log yahan nahaakar pavitra hua karte the

 There is a feeling that this civilization was in its last phase decadent

 Scholars do not agree on the reasons for its destruction
 sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke avsaan ke peeche vibhinn tark diye jate hai jaise: akraman, jalwaayu parivartan evam paristhitik asantulan, barh tathaa bhu-tathvik parivartan, mahamari, aarthik kaaran
 It seems that there was not a single reason for the decline of this civilization, but because of a combination of different reasons
 jo alag alag samay main yaa ek saath hone ki sambhaavna he
 The city and drainage system in Mohenjo Daro seems less likely to have an epidemic

 Thanks in advance, Felagund, he wiki ambassador
 "stub" and "substub" are English dialects
 mujhe lagata he ki aise angrezi alfaaz istamaal karne se lekh samajhnaa thodaa mushakil ho jaataa he
 We can definitely use some Hindi word for them! agar mai apni raay pesh karun to ham "stub" ke badale me "paudha" or"sabstub" ke badale me "beej" istamaal kar sakate hai
 These inscribe the condition of the script clearly, and also introduce vicky-kalpana
 ninorsk vikipedia pe hamane aise hi kuch kiya
 It was just my idea - if you don't like it, then it doesn't matter
 -- aravind 15:21, 9 june 2006 i think the issue has been that words like "stub" or "substub" do not matter to Hindi users
 par "ankur" yaa "paudh" jaise alankaarit shabd rakhane se bhi khaas laabh nahin hoga kyonki naye prayoktaaon yaa pathakon ke ye shabd bhi stub jitne hi anjaan shabd honge
 It is better if words with direct meaning are taken, such as "immature" for the substub and "initial" or "initial" or "base" for the stub
 agar aap likhenge "yah ek aadhaar lekh he" yaa "yah aparipakv lekh he" to myne zyada spasht honge
 i support Debashish's talk
 shabd saral hona chahie
 The word "immature" may sound that is not a stub, they are mature and even if they do not contribute
 to "aadhaar lekh" shabd zyada upyukt hoga
 If the word looks like it should increase the article then it would be more appropriate
 mjedaar shabd "baccha lekh" ho saktaa tha
 :) If no other word is suggested, my opinion is still on the "base article", but it seems and may be the appropriate word
 Liked a top box on all the pages in Marathi Wikipedia mr:mukhaprishth, giving a link on how to write in Marathi
 Its a good idea

 i agree, and since they're derived from Indian numerals anyway, i don't see the harm

 Mingora was captured by the Taliban from March 2009 to May 2009, until the Pakistani Army launched a campaign to gain control of the area
 sangharsh ke dauraan, 11 saal kii umr main hi malala ne diary likhni shuru kar di thi
 Malala first appeared in the world in 2009, writing a diary for BBC Urdu under the pseudonym "gul Corn"
 jisamen usne swat main taliban ke kukrityon kaa varnan kiya tha or apane dard ko diary main bayaan kiya
 Malala, fond of writing a diary, wrote in her diary, 'today was the last day of school, so we decided to play a little longer on the field
 meraa maananaa he ki ek din skool khulegaa lekin jate samay maine skool kii imaarat ko is tarah dekha jaise main yahaan phir kabhi nahin aauungi
 ' malala ne blog or media main taliban kii jyadatiyon ke bare main jab se likhnaa shuru kiya tab se use kai baar dhamkiyaan milin
 At the age of 11, Malala worked to bring painful stories related to the fanatical decrees of the Taliban in front of people
 malala un peedit ladakiyon main se he jo taliban ke farmaan ke kaaran lambey samay tak skool jane se vanchit raheen
 Three years ago, the Taliban banned girls from going to school in the Swat Valley
 ladakiyon ko tivi kaarykram dekhne kii bhi manaahi thi
 ता The Taliban were in possession of the Swat Valley and there was a ban on many things from the school
 malala bhi isaki shikaar hui

 Even after a lot of efforts, the experts could not find out the secret of its strength, then they cut a piece of temple stone and found that the stone is very light in weight, they put that piece of stone in the water
 The piece floated in water, that is, Archimedes' theory proved to be wrong here

 Till now scientists could not know the secret of that stone from where Ramappa brought this stone, because such stones are not found anywhere in the world which floats in water
 So, did Ramappa make these stones himself 800 years ago? If yes, what technology did they have !! That too 800-900 years ago xxrep 5 ! ramppa yaa ram lingeshwar mandir andhra pradesh ke varangal se 70ki

 Accounting has been called the 'language of business'
 hindi main 'accountancy' ke samatuly 'lekhavidhi' tathaa 'lekhakarm' shabdon kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Accounting is the branch of mathematical science that is useful in finding the reasons for success and failure in business

 For this, he makes extensive use of manuals and accounting methods

 Although bookkeeping and accounting are not compulsory for a businessman, but without this they cannot carry out their work successfully and they are not even aware of the profit or loss from their business activities
 lekhe rakhane kii kriya kisi na kisi rup main us samay se vidyaman he jab se vyavsaay kaa janm hua he
 a very small businessman can keep accounts in the brain by recourse to memorisation, another can provide written form on paper
 vyavasthit rup se lekha rakhaa jaye yaa avyavasthit rup se, yah lekhankan hi kahalaayegaa
 As the size of the business grew and the nature of the business became increasingly complex accounting began to take shape
 isamen tark vitark, kaaran prabhaav vishleshan ke aadhaar par pratipaadit thos niyamon evam siddhanton kii neenv padati gai evam saamaanya lekha-jokha ek kaalaantar main vrahat lekhashastra ke rup main hamaare saamne aayaa
 The size of modern business has grown so much that hundreds, thousands and thousands of business transactions take place in it
 in len denon ke byore ko yaad rakhkar vyavsaayik upkram kaa sanchaalan karnaa asambhav he
 Therefore, systematic records of these transactions are kept and their systematic knowledge and experimentation is called accounting
 lekhashastra ke vyaavhaarik rup ko lekhankan kah sakate hai
 According to the Bulletin, the accounting terminology of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, "accounting for behaviors and events that are at least partly financial in nature, effectively writing, classifying and summarizing money as a currency and the consequences thereof
" Is the art of explaining
 ’’ According to this definition accounting is an art, not a science
 is kala kaa upyog vittiya prakruti ke mudra main maapneey vyavhaaron or ghatnaon ke abhilekhan, vargeekaran, sankshepan or nirvachan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Smith and Ashburn have presented the above definition with some improvement
 unke anusaar ‘lekhankan mukhyatah vittiya prakruti ke vyavsaayik lendenon or ghatnaon ke abhilekhan tathaa vargeekaran kaa vigyaan he or un lendeene or ghatnaon kaa mahatvapurn saransh banane, vishleshan tathaa vyakhya karne or parinaamon ko un vyaktiyon ko sampreshit karne kii kala he, jinhen nirnay lene hai
 According to this definition, accounting is both science and art
 kintu yah ek purna nishchit vigyaan na hokar lagbhag purna vigyaan he
 The American Accounting Principles Board has defined accounting as a service action
 uske anusaar, ‘lekhankan ek seva kriya he
 Its function is to give consequential information of financial nature mainly about financial units which is useful in making economic decisions by rational selection in alternative behavioral actions
 ’ Based on the above considerations, accounting can be called the art of writing, presenting, interpreting and informing the transactions of the financial nature of the business in a definite, structured and well planned manner
 sarvapratham praarambhik lekhankan ke record pracheen babylon, asyria or sumeria ke khandhar main paae gaye, jo 7000 varshon se bhi pehle kii taarikh ke hai
 The people of the time relied on ancient accounting methods to record the growth of crops and cattle
 kyonki krishi or pashu paalan ke liye prakritik ritu hoti he, atah agar fasalon kii paidaavaar ho chuki ho yaa pashuon ne nae bachche paidaa kiye hon to hisaab-kitaab kar adhishesh ko nirdhaarit karnaa aasaan ho jaataa he
 Based on the above definitions of accounting, the following characteristics are clear - lekhankan ek kala or vigyaan donon he
 In the form of art, it helps to know the financial result
 isamen abhilikhit tathaa vargeekrut len-denon or ghatnaon kaa saransh taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 They are analyzed and interpreted
 vittiya samankon kaa vishleshan evam nirvachan lekhankan kii kala hi he jiske liye vishesh gyaan, anubhav or yogyata kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 Similarly, conveying the meaning of financial data to the internal and external aspects of a business and its changes in such a way that they can take wise decisions in relation to business, is the art of accounting
 vigyaan ke rup main yah ek vyavasthit gyaan shakha he
 It has definite rules for recording, categorizing and summarizing transactions and events
 in nishchit niyamon ke kaaran hi lekhon kaa krambaddh va vyavasthit rup se abhilekhan kiya jaataa he
 But it is not a 'completely definite' science, but an 'almost perfect science'
 lekhankan main mudra main maapan yogya vittiya prakruti kii ghatnaon or vyavhaaron kaa hi lekha kiya jaataa he
 Practices that are not financial in nature are not accounted for in books
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi ek sanstha ke paas samarpit va vishwasaneey karmchaariyon kii ek toli ho jo vyavsaay ke liye bahut upyogi he, kaa lekha vyavsaay kii pustakon main nahin kiya jaayegaa kyonki yah vittiya prakruti kii nahin he tathaa ise mudra main abhivyakt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Accounting is a service function according to the board's definition of accounting principles
 iskaa uddeshy vyavsaayik kriyaaon ke bare main parimanatmak vittiya suchanaaen uplabdh karana he
 The final product of accounting, ie the financial statement, is useful to those who make decisions about alternative functions
 lekhankan swayan kisi dhan kaa srijan nahin karata he, yadhyapi yah iske upyogkartaaon ko upyogi soochna uplabdh karaata he jo inhen dhan ke srijan evam rakh rakhaav main sahaayak hota he
 The main objectives of accounting are as follows - prayek vyavsaayik len-dein ko pustakon main krambaddh tareeke se likhnaa va uchit hisaab rakhana lekhankan kaa pratham uddeshy he
 In the absence of accounting, there would be a lot of burden on human memory which in most cases would have been impossible to bear
 vidhivat abhilekhan se bhul va chal-kapaton ko dur karne main sahaayta milti he
 Accounting protects against improper and undesirable use of business assets
 aisa lekhankan dwaara prabandh ko nimna suchanaaen pradaan karne ke kaaran sambhav hota he - The above information helps the business owner to know that the funds of the business are not unnecessarily idle
 lekhankan avadhi ke ant main vyavsaay sanchaalan ke falswaroop utpann shuddh laabh athwa haani kaa nirdhaaran lekhankan kaa pramukh uddeshy he
 There is a difference between net profit or loss and some proceeds of certain duration and some expenses
 yadi aagmon kii raashi adhik he to shuddh laabh hoga tathaa vipareet paristhiti main shuddh haani
 It is an indicator of managerial skills and business progress
 yahi anshadhariyon main labhaansh vitaran kaa aadhaar hota he
 The information provided by the profit and loss account is not sufficient
 vyavsaayee apni vittiya sthiti bhi jaananaa chahta he
 This is accomplished by letter
 chittha ek vishesh tithi ko vyavsaay kii sampattiyon evam dayitvon kaa vivaran he
 It acts as a barometer in knowing the financial health of the business
 vivekpurna nirnay lene ke liye sambandhit adhikariyon evam sanstha main hit rakhane vaale vibhinn pakshakaron ko vaanchit soochna uplabdh karana, lekhankan kaa uddeshy he
 The American Accounting Association has also given special emphasis to this point while defining accounting
 unke anusaar, The first task of accounting is to systematically and methodically accounting all business deals and events in the journal
 yahaan yah dhyaan rakhane kii aavashyaktaa he ki lekhankan main unheen saudon evam ghatnaon kaa lekha kiya jaataa hai jo vittiya swabhaav kii hai tathaa jinhen mudra ke rup main vyakt kiya ja saktaa he
 After accounting for monetary transactions, they are classified according to their nature into separate groups on the basis of equality so that separate information can be available for different items separately
 udhaahrantaya samast bikri ke saudo ko, jo bhinn bhinn sthanon par likhe gayi hai, ek hi sthaan par ekatrit karnaa, taaki kul bikri kii raashi gyaat ho sake
 This is done by opening accounts in the ledger
 lekhankan kaa mukhya uddeshy nirnay lene waalon ke liye mahatvapurn soochna pradaan karnaa he
 For this work, at the end of the year, after finding the balances of all the accounts, a list is made from them and two details - profit and loss account and letter are prepared from that list
 in vivaranon se vyavsaay kii laabhadaayakta, vittiya sthiti, bhugtan kshamta aadi ke sambandh main mahatvapurn suchanaaen uplabdh ho jaati he
 In this way all the information of the year is summarized and merges into two details which shows the final results of the business
 lekhankan na keval lekha karne, vargeekaran karne evam sankshipteekaran karne kaa hi kaary karti he balki un aankadon kaa nirvachan karke nishkarsh evam upyogi suchnaaain bhi pradaan karti he
 For example, what was the rate of repatriation in the organization? How much did advertising impact sales growth? Information such as the status of liquidity and payment capacity are available
 lekhon ke vishleshan evam nirvachan se praapt soochnaaon kaa unke prayogkartaaon jaise viniojakon, lendaaron, sarkaar, swaamiyon aadi tathaa vyavsaay main hit rakhane vaale anya vyaktiyon ko sanvahan kiya jaataa he taaki ve vyavsaay kii vittiya sthiti ke sambandh main apni raay bana saken tathaa bhavi yojana ke sambandh main nirnay le sake
 The last task of accounting is to make such arrangements so that various statutory requirements can be met
 anek aise kanoon hai jinaki purti karnaa ek vyavsaayee ke dwaara anivaary he jaise iskar kii ritern prastut karnaa, bikrikar kii ritern prastut karnaa, sebi ke dwaara banaaye gayi niyamon kii paalna karnaa aadi
 Accounting helps in this task
 aadhunik vyapaarik kriyaaon ke safal sanchaalan ke liye lekhankan ko ek aavashyaktaa samajha jaataa he
 Why accounting is necessary can be explained by the following arguments - lekhankan kii anek pranaliyaan hai jinamein se nimnlikhit ullekhneey hai- 1

 Broadly, the structured word that derives some specific meaning from the symptomatic and sometimes euphemistic is called idiom
 kai baar yah vyangyatmak bhi hote hai
 The idioms make the language strong, dynamic and interesting
 muhaavaron ke prayog se bhashaa main adbhut chitramyata aati he
 Without idioms, the language becomes dull, dull and soulless
 hindi bhashaa main bahut adhik prachlit or logon ke munhchadhe vaakya lokokti ke taur par jane jate hai
 These sentences contain the essence of the public experience
 vibhinn vidwaanon ne vibhinn prakaar se ‘muhaavarey’ kii paribhaasha kii he jinamein se kuchhek yahan di ja rahi hai: Dr
 Uday Narayan Tiwari has written- ‘advance larners dictionari’ main e0es0 hornbi ne likhaa he ki According to 'chambers's Twentieth Century Dictionary', 'oxford canceiese dictionari' ke anusaar, The most comprehensive and satisfying definition of 'idiom' is given by Dr
 Omprakash Gupta in the following words: muhaavarey bhashaa kii neenv ke pathar hai jis par uskaa bhavy bhawan aaj tak rukaa hua he or muhaavarey hi uski tut-foot ko thik karte hue garmi, sardi or barsaat ke prakope se ab tak uski raksha karte chale aa rahe hai
 The idioms make the language strong, dynamic and interesting
 unke prayog se bhashaa main chitramyata aati he jaise-apane pairon par kulhadi maarna, daanton tale ungali dabaanaa, ranga siyaar hona aadi
 Words have three powers: jab kisi shabd yaa shabd-samooh kaa saamaanya arth main prayog hota he, tab vahaan uski abhidha shakti hoti he
 The expression meaning by abhidha is called abhidhayartha or mainartha; For example, 'to climb on the head' means to lift something from a place and place it on the head
 parantu jab mukhyarth kaa bodh na ho or roodhi yaa prasiddh ke kaaran athwa kisi vishesh prayojan ko suchit karne ke liye, mukhyarth se sambhddha kisi anya arth kaa gyaan ho tab jis shakti ke dwaara aisa hota he use lakshana kehete hai
 This power is 'arpit' meaning
 isiilie ‘sahityadarpan’ main vishwanath ne likhaa he : To 'climb on the head' from the symptom would mean reverence
 mammat ne bhi ‘kavy prakaash’ main or adhik bodhgamy shabdon main unke abhimath kaa samarthan kiya he
 For example, "rolling on the coals", "winking", "cutting eyes in the night", "playing with fire", "lighting up the sky", "shedding milk and ghee", "sucking blood", "peace" Symbolic power has been used in playing 'banshi', 'laughing', 'long arm', 'vijay's dancer' and becoming a lion '
 isliye ve muhaavarey hai
 But it is visible from this context that not all examples of symptoms can come under idioms
 lakshana ke keval vahi udhaaharan muhaavaron ke antargat aa sakate hai jo chir abhyaas ke kaaran rudha yaa prasiddh ho gaye hai
 When Abhidha and Lakshana are relieved by doing their work, then the power through which information is given to any meaning of word-groups or sentences is called 'vyanjana'
 muhaavaron main jo vyangyarth rahata he, vah kisi ek shabd ke arth ke kaaran nahin balki sab shabdon ke shrinkhalit arthon ke kaaran hota he, athwa yah kahen ki puure muhaavarey ke arth main rahata he
 Thus the satirical meaning of the phrase 'to climb on the head' depends neither on 'head' nor on 'offering', but the whole idiom means' disorderly, indiscipline or insolent
 ’ yah vyangyarth abhidheyarth tathaa lakshana abhivyakti arth se bhinn hota he
 Figures of speech are used in many idioms
 parantu iskaa yah arth nahin he ki prayek muhaavara alankaar hota he athwa prayek alankaryukt vaakyansh muhaavara hota he

 homes ke pustak likhane, sangeet, geet or sho ke liye purna vadakvrund ke junun ko dekhte hue drud kuch had tak asaamaanya he
 Holmes, however, believed that no Broadway producer had done so before and despite frequent mentions of this feat in show reviews and articles, the practice was not entirely uncommon in the early days of musical drama theater
 adolf philip sahit geetkaaron ko pehle se unke sangeet naatakon kii pustakon ke saath shrey diya
 haalanki, sangeetkaaron / liberatists ne apana khud kaa arcaustrations nahin likhe the
 In writing the book, Holmes did not let Dickens overshadow his intentions
 Instead of imitating Dickens' writing style, which he felt would be disappointing for the kind of show he wanted to write, Holmes devised a tactic of "within-show"
 The cast members of Drood did not specifically portray Dickens 'characters, but were performed by the cast of the musical drama Hall, who were performing Dickens' characters
 is yukti se halke-phulke hasya ko shaamil karne main kaaphi madad mili, jo dicans ke upanyaas main mulat: nahin mila, jise sho main shaamil kiya jaataa or na hi kai geet bhi, jo mul kahani se asambaddha the
 Explaining the decision, Holmes reportedly stated that "this is not Nicolas Nickelbai's set for music — it is not a Dickensian work
" " yah halkaa-phulka, mjedaar or manoranjak he
 i think — but i hope Dickens would have enjoyed it as well
 "holmes also said that" it is the same relationship with Dickens that Kiss Me Kate has with The Taming of the Seeru
 " mookabhinay avadharana ne homes ko lead purush bhoomika main ek mahila ko rakhane kii suvidha di, jisane aage unhen ek prem geet likhane avasar diya, jise tej aawaaj vaale do gayakon dwaara gavaaya janaa tha
 As one of the most fundamental ideas, Holmes adopted a novel way to determine the outcome of the play; That was the turnout of the audience for the end
 At the time of the show, the audience voted on who killed Drood, the identity of the mysterious Dick Datchery and which two characters would fall in love at the end, making the ending enjoyable
 Since every audience is different in nature, the result is theoretically unpredictable even for actors and they have to rapidly count votes and complete the play according to the chosen end
 Holmes was required to do additional work with this plan, who had to write several short endings, which could be chosen according to every possible voting result
 sangeet naatak or upanyaas ke bich kai vibhinnataayen hai
 The tone of Dickens' original book was somewhat bleak, while the show was remarkably entertaining and played for comedy
 charitra-chithran main ullekhneey antar jasper ke rup main shaamil he: yadhyapi dicans kaa charitra beshak damit or pareshaan dikhataa he, par vah puri tarah dohare vyaktitv vaala chitrit nahin kiya jaataa, jaisaa ki use sangeet naatak main laganaa chahie
 Many minor characters are removed and the role of others is expanded
 sangeet naatak main baijrd chrisaparcal kaa sahaayak he, jabaki upanyaas main vah rojaa ke abhibhavak mistar griyulius dwaara niyukt kiya gaya he
 Meanwhile, many clues from the novel are removed in the musical drama to increase the play's interactivity and to raise suspicion of who the murderer is that Jasper is the killer and introduces clues that do not appear in the novel and Others point towards suspects
 landan ke royaal sangeet naatak haul main "da mistry of edwin drud" ke pravasi mandali sanskaran ke pehle pradarshan taiyaariyaan chal rahi hai
 Members of the troupe give viewers historical information about Dickens' untimely demise and also indicate that the audience will have a role in determining the outcome

" samarohon ke ek tarah ke maalik chairman upasthit logon ko suchit karte hai ki yah ek asaamaanya nirmaan hone ja rahaa he or vah sabhi ko "jitna kanoonee taur par sambhav ho, utana bhonda or asabhy hone" ke liye aamantrit karte hai
 The play begins with the announcement within
 dicans ke jis pehle charitra kaa parichay karaayaa jaataa he, vah he vrundgaan netaa jon jasper, jo samaaj kaa ek 'sammanit' sadsy he or jo darshakon ko yah tathy bataata he ki vah vastav main bhitari pidaa se grast he 
 iske baad jasper ke bhattije edwin drud kaa parichay karaayaa jaataa he, jo rojaa bed ke saath asann vyavasthit vivaah, saath hi saath shaadi ke baad misr ke liye ravaanaa hone kii apni yojana kii charchaa karte hai
 Drood's fiancée Rosa Bud is then introduced to "nuns House"
 vah unka janmdin he or uske sangeet shikshak jasper ne rojaa ke liye ek sangeet kii rachana kii he, jo use gaanaa sunaane ke liye jor dete hai
 During the encore, Ceylon's two orphans Neville and Helena Landless enter with Reverend Crisparkle
 jasper ke geet kii uttejk dhun sunakar rojaa ke moorchhit hone ke baad helena tab uski sahaayta ke liye aati he jab nevil rojaa ke prati aakarshan pradarshit karata he
 Then comes Madame Princess Fur of a poppy base to introduce herself
 ham dekhte hai ki sammanit jasper khud us adde kaa ek graahak he or jaise hi vah drud or rojaa ke sapane dekhtaa he, fer rojaa kaa naam sunne ke baad pratikriya vyakt karti he
 The next day the Rev
 Crisparkle introduces Edwin and the landless twins
 jab drud misr ke pyramid ke pattharon se registan ke rajmarg ko dhankane kii yojana ke bare main bataate hai to vah apane nae pratidwandvi nevil or uski bahan naaraaz ho jate hai : ye teenon bahes karne lagate hai 
 jab jasper meyar sapsi saath pravesh karte hai, ve meyar ko bataate hai ki sabakuch hameshaa vaisaa nahin hota, jaisaa prathit hota he 
 Jasper goes to the cemetery, where he gets the key to a tomb
 iske baad edwin or rojaa khulaasa karte hai ki un donon ko apni aagaamee shaadi ke bare main kaaphi galatanhimayaan hai or unhone apni shaadi kii yojana ko todane kaa faisla kiya he, lekin christmas kii chhuttiyon ke baad tak iske bare main nahin bataayenge
 jasper ke ghar par christmas ke ratribhoj kaa jashn manaane ke liye bade khilaadi jutate hai, lekin maahaul khushnuma nahin rah paata, kyonki usamen pratidwandvita or napak iraade bhi prakat hote he 
 duusare logon ke chale jane ke baad edwin or nevil nadi kii ore jate hai or jasper edwin ko apana topkot pradaan karte hai
 The next day Edwin disappears and Crisparkle's assistant Badger Jasper finds a torn and blood-stained coat
 mana jaataa he ki drud kii hatya ho gai he or nevil mukhya sandigdh he
 The badgers regret their own failures for a moment, but remain optimistic
 haalanki bandhak bana liye gayi nevil ko jaldi reeha kar diya jaataa he
 Meanwhile, Jasper confesses to Rosa that he has fallen in love with her
 naaraaz rojaa jasper kii ore mudati he he, jo "moonphal" kii aavriti kii ore prerit karata he
 Six months later, Edwin Drood is still missing, and Princess Puffer and a stranger Dick Datchery arrive to investigate the mystery of Edwin's disappearance
 is samay chairman dipti or dardles ke saath darshakon ko yah yaad dilaane ke liye aate hai ki ve suraagon par dhyaan den 
 Puffer, who is looking for Jasper, meets Rosa Bud and the rest of the cast and tells them not to give up their ambitions
 Suddenly everything stops in the middle of the song: it's as long as Dickens got before he died
 ab darshakon ke liye yah nirnay karne kaa samay he ki kaise kahani samaapt hogi
 First it will be determined whether Edwin has actually died or not
 It turns out that female idiot Alice Nutting is wearing Datchery's attire to fulfill her contract of acting in the play's double issue — but are Datchery and Drood the same and the same? Artists vote unanimously that Drood is indeed dead
 baahar bheje jane se pehle elis naaraaz hokar kalakaaron se kahati he ki ve sabhi usase irshyaa karte hai or yahi ekmaatr kaaran he ki use barkhaast kiya ja rahaa he
 After he exits, the chairman reveals the truth: Alice was in pain, but it remains to be determined who exactly Datchery is
 darshak tali bajaakar ek naye datcheri ke liye matdaan karte hai or chunaa hua abhinayta final ke liye poshaak badalane chalaa jaataa he
 The killer is to be determined further
 chairman sambhavit hatyaron or aparaadh ke liye unke makasad kii suchi ko sankshipt rup main pesh karte hai
 Viewers are asked to vote "district-wise" for the killers and by the time the vote is counted, "setting up the score" moves toward the resolution of "the Mystery"
 pafar rojaa ko khoj leti he or bataati he ki varshon pehle vah rojaa kii dai thi 
 vah "pafar ke bayaan" par adig rahati he or datcheri kii pahchaan bataati he 
 shaam kii datcheri bataati hai ki kyon vah hatyare kii khoj karnaa chaahati he or turant jasper par kaatil hone kaa aarope lagaati hai
 Jasper soon confesses that he strangled his nephew with opium addiction
 Although the grave digger Durdles does not agree with this, he has seen the crime and knows who actually killed Edwin Drood
 Depending on the vote of the audience, the finger is pointed towards Bazard, Crisparkle, Helena, Neville, Puffer, Rosa or myself
 kaatil aparaadh kabool kar letaa he, tab apane doshi hone kii baat sweekaar karne ke liye kai geeton main se ek geet kii punrariti karata he
 Yet a happy ending is needed and the chairman asks the audience to choose two lovers from among the remaining cast members
 chune gaye do sadsy apane pyaar kaa elaan karte hai or phir "parfect strangers" geet kii punrariti karte hai
 Shortly thereafter, a noise comes from the basement and Edwin Drood appears alive and he is all set to tell what really happened on the night of his disappearance
 The secret is lifted and the members of the company bow down and greet
 jon jasper jasper rojaa bed ke pyaar main pagal tha or uske dohare vyaktitv ne kushi-kushi drud ko maar daalaa
 Rosa Bud-wanted to kill him to avenge Jasper's lustful intentions, but accidentally killed Drood, as he was wearing Jasper's coat
 nevil landleys - drud dwaara apamaanit nevil ne swabhimaan kii raksha ke liye or rojaa bed ko paane ke maukey ke liye uski hatya kar di
 Helena Landless - Knowing her brother's furious nature, Helena murders Drood so that Neville cannot be seduced into revenge
 rajkumaari pafar -jasper ko maarna chaahati thi, taaki rojaa ko uske iraadon se bachaaya ja sake, lekin galati se drud maar daalaa, kyonki vah jasper kaa kot pahane hue tha
 The Rev
 Mr
 Crisparkle - After being replaced as priest after Rosa's mother's death, he assumed that Jasper is the incarnation of Satan and accidentally killed Drood, as Drood was wearing Jasper's overcoat coat
 baijrd - sho main apni bhoomika ko chamak pradaan karne ke prayaas main drud kii hatya kar di
 This was definitely one of the most dramatic endings
 dardles - jasper ke drud ko tahkhaane main rakhane ke baad dardles ne ab bhi jivit drud ke bhoot hone kaa vishwaas kiya or uske sir ko chakanachur kar diya
 This solo recital was not used in the original Broadway production and was added for the first national tour

 On jogan internet movie database yah lekh sanskrit ke mahakavi bhaas kii rachana 'dootvaakya' ke bare main nahin he
 The Dootkavya is a typical tradition of Sanskrit poetry, beginning with the verses of Bhasa and Ghatkarpar and the Meghdoot of Mahakavi Kalidasa, however, its seeds appear to be much older
 parinishthit kaavyon main valmiki dwaara varnit vah prasang, jisen ram ne sita ke paas apana virah sandesh bheja, is parampara kii aadi kadi mana jaataa he
 Kalidas himself has also indicated in his "meghdoot" that he got the inspiration to make Megh the messenger from the Hanumanwala episode of Valmiki "ramayana"
 duusari or is parampara ke beej lokkavyon main bhi sthit jaan padate hai, jahaan virahi or virahiniyan apane apane prempatro ke pati bhramar, shuk, chatak, kaak aadi pakshiyon ke dwaara sandesh le jane kaa vinay karti milti hai

 bhavanubhuti ke saath is kavy kii anyatam visheshta padaant yamak alankaar kaa prayog he
 In terms of style, this very short poem has also made a special place in Sanskrit literature and it is said that due to the beauty of this work, the poet challenged other poets that whichever poet would make a more excellent creation, the author His house is ready to be filled with water from the pitcher
 isi pratigya ke kaaran rachayita kii oopaadhi, "ghatkarper" ho gai or hamen uske vaastavik naam kaa pataa nahin chalata
 Some scholars consider this work to be Kalidasa's work, but it has been proved that it is not Kalidasa's work
 "ghatkarper" kaa samay anirnit he, vaise anushruthik parampara ke anusaar "ghatkarper" bhi vikramaditya ke navratnon main se ek the
 It can only be said that the composition of this poem is older than Kalidasa
 is parampara kii shashakt kriti mahakavi kalidas kaa "meghdoot" he, jisamen kuber ke dwaara ramagiri parvat par nirvasit yaksha, kamarth hokar, achetan megh ke madhyam se dur alakapuri main sthit apni priya ke paas yah sandesh bhejtaa he ki vah kisi tarah nirvaasan avadhi ke bache-khuche maheene or guzaar de or phir ve sharad kii chandani se dhuli raaton main apane saare armaan puure karenge hi
 Many Sanskrit poets have given important yoga in carrying forward the tradition of Dutkavya or Sandeshkavya
 is sambandh main sarvapratham bengal ke raja lakshmanasen ke darbari kavi kshamapati dhoyi kaa zikr karnaa aavashyak hoga

 In the form of overall poetry, there is only one work in the literature of the Central Indian Aryabhasha, which falls in the tradition of Meghdoot and is the "sandeshrasak" of the Apabhramsa poet Udahmana
 12veen shatee main multan ke ek julahe addahamaan ne raasak geetikavyon kii style main ek kavy kii rachana kii jisamen virahinee nayika khambhaat jate hue kisi pathik se apane priy ke paas sandesh le jane ke liye prarthana karti he
 In addition to the beautification of the heroine in this poem, there is a delightful story narration and poignant expression of the heroism of the heroine
 hindi main "dhola maaru raa duha" main kuch dohe aise hai, jinka swaroop dootkavy style kaa he
 Apart from this, such places are available in Hindi premeditated poetry, where Virhi Prannayi has tried to send a message to his beloved by some means
 is sambandh main jaaysi ke "naagmativirah varnan" main uplabdh kuch sthalon kaa sanket kiya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, under the Bhramargeet tradition in Hindi Krishnakavya, some seeds of Dutkavya or Sandeshkavya will be found
