 In this sense, it is the fourteenth largest city in the United States by area
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles 
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960
 The city is located in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 ° C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 ° f warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 °F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 °F, with overnight lows of 63 °F 
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 °F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 °F and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 ° f and 73 ° f in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 ° f in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 ° f in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 ° f on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 ° f on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical coral tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the bird of paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 The Adigranth is the main scripture of the Sikh sect
 ise 'guru granth sahib' bhi kehete hai
 It was edited by Sri Guru Arjun Dev Ji, the fifth Guru of Sikhism
 guru granth sahib ji kaa pehla prakaash 16 agast 1604 ko harimandir sahib amritsar main hua
 In Damdama Sahib in 1705, Dashmesh's father Guru Govind Singh Ji completed it by adding 116 words of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, totaling 1430 pages
 gurugranth sahib main maatr sikh guruon ke hi upadesh nahin he, varan 30 anya hindu sant or alang dharm ke muslim bhakton kii vaani bhi sammilit he
 While it speaks of Brahmin devotees like Jayadevji and Parmanandji, the representatives of castes considered hayas in the then Hindu society suffering from caste-based self-discrimination, such as Kabir, Ravidas, Namdev, Sain Ji, Saghna Ji, Chhivaji, Dhanna Speeches are also included

 At the same time, the use of music notes and 31 ragas has also made the introspective esoteric spiritual teachings sweet and sensual

 According to Guruvani, a person gets importance only according to his deeds

 Although Guru Granth Sahib recognizes the importance of introspection, meditation, Guruvani opposes abandonment, inaction, inertia in the name of Sadhana

 saanchaa:sandook sikh sampradaay The holy scripture of the Sikhs, which was stored by his fifth Guru Arjun Dev in 1604 AD, and which the Sikh Matanuayi also called 'guru Granth Sahib Ji' and honored as Guruvat
 'aadigranth' ke antargat sikhon ke pratham paanch guruon ke atirikt unke nawein guru or 14 'bhagaton' kii baniyaan aati hai
 Such a collection probably began to be prepared from the time of Guru Nanakdev and Moradhan, son of Guru Amardas, also preserved the letters of the first four gurus, which the fifth guru rearranged from him and some of the 'bhagats' Including the statements of 'bhai Gurudas', everyone got it written in Gurmukhi

 Its same form is still considered present today
 isaki keval ekaadh antim rachanaaon ke vishay main hi yah kahana kathin he ki ve kab or kis prakaar jod di gai
 The first five compositions of 'granth' are famous by the names of 'japunisanu', 'sodru' Mahla 1, 'sunibra' Mahla 1, 'so Purakhu', Mahla 4 and Sohila Mahla respectively, and their 'sirairag' etc
 are divided into 31 ragas
 Come in which the compositions of the first Sikh Gurus are stored according to them
 inke ananthar bhagaton ke pad rakhe gaye hai, kintu bich-bich main kahin-kahin 'baramasa', 'thinti', 'dinarani', 'ghodian', 'siddh goshtee', 'karahale', 'birhade', 'sukhmani' aadi jaisi katipay choti badi vishisht rachanaayen bhi jod di gai hai jo saadhaaran lokgeeton ke kavyprakar udaahat karti hai
 Among the posts ranked according to those ragas, the Salok Sahas Kriti, 'gatha' Mahla 5, 'phunhe' Mahla 5, Choubolane Mahla 5, Savaiya Seemukh Vakha Mahla 5 and Mudavani Mahla 5 have been ranked and a ragamala has also been given at the end of all is

 The compositions stored in the 'granth' seem to be somewhat different due to linguistics, mostly providing examples of harmony and uniformity
 aadigranth ko kabhi-kabhi 'gurubaani' maatr bhi kah dete hai, kintu apane bhakton kii drushti main vah sadaa shariri guruswaroop he
 Therefore, like a Guru, he is 'covered' in a high cushion under the moonlight after wearing it in clean silk clothes, pouring flowers on it, offering flowers, taking his aarti and washing his bath in front of him and paying respectfully
 kabhi-kabhi uski shobhaayatra bhi nikaali jaati he tathaa sadaa uske anusaar chalane kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 The texts are recited weekly and sometimes monolithically, and some of the lines are recited even when the children are christened, they are initiated and Mangalotsavs are performed or cremated
 vishisht choti badi rachanaaon ke paath ke liye praat: kaal, siankal, shayanvela jaise upyukt samay nishchit hai ore yadhyapi pramukh sangruhit rachanaaon ke vishay pradhanat: darshanik siddhant, aadhyatmik sadhana evam stutigaan se hi sambandh rakhte jaan padate hai, isamen andeh nahin ki 'aadi granth' dwaara sikhon kaa puraa dharmik jivan prabhavit he
 a collection of Guru Gobind Singh is famous as 'dasam Granth' which is different and completely different from 'adigranth'

 The Guruvaniyan of Guru Granth Sahib is incarnated in most of the state of Punjab and due to this the common people guess their language like Punjabi; While there is no such a thing

 On the other hand, even though the script of Shri Dasam Granth is Gurmukhi, its language is often poetical in Hindi
 isaki bhashaa punjabi-bhashiyon ke liye or adhik duruh kintu hindi-bhashiyon ke liye bhaleebhanti jaani-pahachaani he
 The language of Guru Granth Sahib is also called 'sant Bhasha' which is a mixture of many languages, sacrifices and subbolis, in which Lhindi Punjabi, Brajbhasha, Khadi Boli, Sanskrit and Persian etc
 are prominent

 The history of clocks began in 16th-century Europe, where clocks developed from portable spring-propelled watches, first dated in the 15th century
 praarambhik 15 veen shatabdi main khilone ke avishkaar se portable ghadi-tukade sambhav ho gaye the
 The Nuremberg watchmaker is often credited as the inventor of the clock
 vah pehle german shilpkaar main se ek tha, jinhone "ghadi-ghadiyon" ko banaaya, sajaavati typises jo pendent ke rup main pahana jate the, jo sharir par pahane jane vaale pehle ghadi-tukade the
 His fame is based on a passage by Johann in 1511: Peter Hayley, still a young man, doing fashion work that admires even the most learned mathematicians
 vah lohe ke chote tukdon se kai pahiyaa ghadiyon ko aakaar detaa he, jo chalis ghanton ke bina ghanton ke bina ghanton tak ghumta he, chaahe stan main hon yaa ek handbag main he kyo naa ho
 However, other German watchmakers were making miniature watches during this period, and there is no evidence earlier
 16 veen shatabdi se lekar 20 veen shatabdi tak jo ghadi viksit hui thi, vah ek yantric upkaran tha, jo ki ek gaming ghumaakar sanchalit hoti thi, jo gears ban gai thi or phir haathon ko sthanantarit kar diya tha or ek ghurnan santulan pahiyaa ke saath samay rakhaa tha
 The invention of the quartz watch in the 1960s, running on electricity and taking time with a vibrating quartz crystal, proved to be a revolutionary departure for the industry
 1980 ke dashak ke dauraan quartz ghadiyon ne maikenical ghadiyon se bazaar par kabja kar liya, ek ghatana jise "quartz sankat" kaha jaataa he
 Although mechanical watches still sell at the high end of the market, most watches now have quartz movements
 An account of the origin of the word "watch" is that it came from the Old English word wussy, which meant "watchman" because it Used by city guards to keep track of their shifts
 ek or kehete hai ki yah shabd 17 veen shatabdi ke navikon se aayaa tha, jinhone apane jahaaz ke dibbe kii lambaai ke samay ke liye nai tantra kaa istemaal kiya tha
 The first watch-pieces, worn in the 16th century in the German cities of Nuremberg and Augsburg, were transitional in shape between watches and clocks
 ye 'ghadghor ghadiyaan' kapade par baandha jaati thim yaa gardan ke chaaron ore ek shrinkhalaa par pahana jaataa tha
 They were several inches in diameter, engraved and ornate in cylindrical brass boxes shaped like heavy drums

 Many movements involved striking or alarm mechanisms, usually wounding twice a day

 These early time-clocks were not worn to tell the time

 manorog vigyaan yaa manorog vidya chikitsa kshetra kii ek visheshgyata he jo manovikaron kaa adhyayan karti he
 Psychology is a new science of the modern era
 20veen sadi main hi is vigyaan ke vibhinn angon main mahatv kii khojein hui hai
 Till the 19th century, various types of psychosis were considered diseases that had no relation to the general practitioner
 jatil manovikar kii avasthaa main rogi ko maansik chikitsaalayon main rakh diya jaataa tha, taaki vah samaaj ke duusare logon kaa koi nuksaan na kar sake
 There was no special treatment in these hospitals
 chikitsakon ko vastav main uski chikitsa ke vishay main spasht gyaan hi na tha ki chikitsa kaise kii jaay
 Now the situation has changed
 manovikar vigyaan ko ek andhiyaari kothri nahin maan liya gaya he, jiskaa sambandh thode se manoveekshipt logon se he, varan yah vigyaan itnaa mahatv kaa vishay mana gaya he ki iskaa samuchit gyaan na keval kushal shaareerik chikitsak ko, varan samaaj ke prayek sevak or kaaryakarta, shikshak, samajasudharak tathaa raajnneetik netaa ko bhi hona aavashyak he
 Not only this, every well-educated citizen also needs its knowledge
 yadi koi prabal manovikar man main aa gaya or hamen uskaa gyaan nahin hua, to ham usase mukt hone ke liye kisi visheshgy kii sahaayta bhi na le sakenge
 Any person, who is perfectly healthy and whose wisdom is praised by all people, can become deranged by losing the balance of his mind at any time
 phir vah samaaj ke liye nikamma ho jaataa he
 a person should know such situations so that he does not fall into some kind of extraordinary mental state, that is, he does not suffer from mental illness
 phir maansik chikitsa karaane ke liye bhi manovikar vigyaan main shraddha hona aavashyak he
 Psychological science developed to meet the special needs of humans
 yah 20veen shatabdi kii ek vishesh dein kaa parinaam he
 In this century, there has been an unthinkable increase in the efficiency and happiness of human beings
 uski taarkik shakti or vaigyanik chamatkaar atyadhik bad gaye hai
 Along with this, his mental activities have increased many times already
 yah kori bakawaad nahin hai ki pratibha or paagalpan ek duusare ke poorak hai
 Along with intellectual development, dementia also develops
 vigyaan sukhad samagriyon main vruddhi karata he, to du:khad paristhitiyon kaa bhi srijan karata he
 It creates a new mental confusion as well as a reconciliation of external conditions
 ek ore vigyaan manushya kii suraksha badha detaa he, to duusari ore achintya chintaaon ko bhi utpann kar detaa he
 Therefore, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the 20th century is a century of insanity

 As much as the country is progressing in civilization, there are more anti-cancer doctors and hospitals in it
 atev manovikaron ke nivaaran hetu anek prakaar kii manovaigyanik khojein maanavvigyaan ke vibhinn kshetron main ho rahi he
 Before Dr
 Freud, doctors used to use only physical medicines for the treatment of mental diseases
 kuch log in rogon ko shant karne ke liye tantropchaar kaa upyog karte the
 Belief and instruction are the basis of mechanism
 aaj bhi is vidhi kaa upyog gramin ashikshit logon main adhiktar hota he
 The famous Belgian psychologist Dr
 Messmer made extensive use of hypnosis and instruction in the treatment of mental diseases
 isse manojaat shaareerik rogon kaa bhi nivaaran hota tha
 Scholars named Braun Heim and Sharco of France showed the usefulness of Sammohan in monsoon
 rogi apni sanmohit avasthaa main dabi maansik bhaavana ko ugal detaa tha or is prakaar ke rechan se vah rogamukt bhi ho jaataa tha
 Dr
 Emile Couyé of Nenson, France, used instruction in the treatment of mental diseases, but not all these methods led to a special advancement of psychiatry
 iske liye man kaa gambhir prayogtmak adhyayan karnaa aavashyak tha
 This work was done by Dr
 Freud
 ab yah mana jane laga ki man kii vibhinnataaon kaa gyaan kiye bina or unamem chalanevaali prakriyaaon ke jane bina kisi bhi vyakti ko uske manovikar se mukt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to Dr
 Freud there are three levels of the mind: conscious, subconscious and unconscious
 man teen prakaar ke kaary bhi karata he : ichchhaaon kaa nirmaan, unka niyantran or unki santushti
 The first work is of the dependent mind, the second work is of the moral mind and the third work is of the ego
 ichchhaaon kaa janm praaia: achetan str par hota he, unka niyantran avchetan par or unki santushti chetan str par hoti he
 Conflict often goes on in the human mind and moral mind
 jab yah sangharsh manushya kii chetana main chalata he, tab vah du:khadaayak chaahe jitna bhi ho par rog kaa kaaran nahin banataa, kintu jab prayatnpurvak kathorta se kisi prabal ichha kaa daman naitik man ke dwaara ho jaataa he, tab sangharsh maansik chetana ke str par na hokar manushya ke achetan man main hone lagata he
 The existence of this struggle is mental disease and freeing the person from this struggle is his mental therapy, which is the goal of psychiatry
 iske liye rogi ko maansik shithilikaran kii avasthaa main laayaa jaataa he or phir use apane apriy athwa aniatik anubhavon ko samaran karne kaa nirdesh diya jaataa he
 For this, some people still use the Sammohan method, but Freud used to psychoanalyze the patient
 is vidhi main rogi ko shant or shithil avasthaa main laakar man main aanevaale sabhi vichaaron or chitron ko kehete jane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 In this way, sometimes the patient tells very unpleasant experiences
 jab ve anubhav puure sajiv ho jate hai or rogi unke anusaar lajja, glani, harsh, vishaad kaa usee prakaar anubhav karata he, jaisaa pehali baar kiya tha, tab uske bhaavon kaa rechan ho jaataa or rog ke anek lakshan samaapt ho jate hai
 The patient does not benefit from blank intellectual memory, but from living memory of old experiences, that is, emotional memory
 jab kisi damit bhav kaa rechna hota he, tab vah pehle pahal maansik chikitsak par hi aropit ho jaataa he
 It is absolutely necessary for the patient to have affection towards the doctor to come out of the feeling
 jab tak rogi or chikitsak main hriday kii ekta nahin hoti, damit ichha avchetana ke str par aati hi nahin
 Then this affection increases day by day
 jaise jaise chikitsak par rogi kii shraddha badhati jaati he, uskaa rog kam hota jaataa he
 While getting rid of his disease, the patient loves the doctor very much
 is pyaar kaa badhanaa or rogamukti ek hi tathy ke do pahalu hai
 Now it is the duty of the physician to turn the impulse of the love of the patient to its proper character, or to use it in some constructive work
 chikitsak rogi ko bhavatmak rachanaavlamban praapt karaane kaa prayaas karata rahata he
 He encourages him to increase his knowledge
 rogi ko rogamukt tabhi samajha ja saktaa he, jab vah na keval rog ke sabhi lakshanon se mukt ho gaya ho, varan use bhavatmak swaavlamban or aatm sujh praapt ho gaye hon
 Psychology is the means to attain this mood
 maansik chikitsavigyaan kii nai khojein manovigyaan ke atirikt duusari dishaao main bhi hui hai
 There are two main among these: maansik rogi ke man main sangharsh chalate rahane ke kaaran vah anidra kaa shikaar ho jaataa he
 Now if such a person is put to sleep in any way, then it is possible that his disease becomes light
 maansik rogi ko do sthalon par sadaa ladate rahanaa padataa he, ek bhitari or duusari bahari
 He has external and internal worries
 iske kaaran vah asaadhaaran rukaawat kaa anubhav karata he
 This causes him to lose sleep
 neend ke kho jane se uski thakaavat or bhi bad jaati he or phir vah paagalpan kii sthiti main aa jaataa he
 If she starts feeling sleepy, then her mental strength will get accumulated and she will be able to solve her external problems
 iske baad uski bhitari samasyaon kii bhayankarta bhi kam ho jaati he
 Therefore, whichever patient can make the patient sleep, it is beneficial for him
 iske liye bhartiya ayuvedic oshadhi sarpgandha he, yaa allopathic vidhi se bani nidra laanevaali tikia hai
 a person suffering from complex mental diseases is sometimes brought to unconscious state
 iske liye use insulin kaa injection diya jaataa he
 After giving it, the patient flings around and expresses physical cramps
 baar baar injection dene par rogi kii tod phod, marpet kii pravriti shant ho jaati he
 His mind is in a state of relaxation
 isse phir rogi swaabhaavik rup se swasthya laabh karata he
 Similar treatment is also done by electric shaking
 inase rogi ko ardhachetan athwa achetan avasthaa main laayaa jaataa he
 His efforts symbolically repel repressed emotions
 jatil rogiyon ke upachaar main praaia: bijli ke jhatkon se hi kaam liya jaataa he
 When they were first used, there was great hope from this treatment method, but all these hopes were not fulfilled
 kuch maansik rogon kii chikitsa prakritik dhang se bhi hoti he
 When the patient abandons his complex work and starts feeling relaxed in nature, then he gets mental equilibrium automatically
 hamaari vartmaan sabhyataa main saamaajik tanaav ke avasar atyadhik bad gaye hai
 When a man abandons his normal routine and starts to give rest to his mind, then he gets well
 da yung ke kathanusaar rog manushya ko aaraam kii aavashyaktaa darshane ke liye aata he
 He teaches her the lesson of subduing her desires
 edward karcenter ke anusaar hamaari vartmaan sabhyataa hi maansik rog he
 It removes us from natural life
 yah hamaari ichchhaaon ko itnaa badha detii he ki unki purti main ham sadaa apane aapako dubo dete hai
 The method by which these vain desires are lacking, is the best remedy for mental health
 atev prakritik jivan maanas-rog-nivaaran kaa uttam upaay he
 Psychological science not only has a place of natural life, but also of religion
 anek maansik vikaar trishna kii vruddhi se or sanyam kii kami se utpann hote hai
 Religion inhibits the growth of craving and increases restraint
 atev vah anek prakaar ke manovikaron ko paidaa hi nahin hone detaa
 Secondly, religion is essentially related to literature and art
 inke dwaara manushya kii nimna koti kii ichchhaaon kaa udasikaran hota rahata he
 Due to this, there is no conflict between these desires and moral intelligence of man and there is no opportunity for the formation of mental glands
 manovikar vigyaan is prakaar hamaari drushti maanav samaaj main prachlit jivan ke un puraane tareekon or mulyon kii ore pher detaa he, jinke hraas ke kaaran manushya ko anek prakaar ke maansik klesh bhogane padate hai
 The social values and culture that will be built with the help of this knowledge will provide permanent health to the life of man
 isi aashaa se is vigyaan kaa vistaar na keval maansik chikitsakon dwaara ho rahaa he, varan sabhi samaaj-kalyaan-chintakon dwaara ho rahaa he
 Psychiatry in India is still in a less developed state
 manorogon ke bare main aam vyakti kii jaankaree galat dharanaon se bhari he
 Even in today's scientific era, ghosts, upper shadows, deities, weather, constellations, luck, fruits of bad deeds etc
 are considered to be the cause of these diseases
 isliye ojha, pujari, maulavee, sadhu, nakli vaidya, neem-hakim, aprashikshit yon-visheshgy ityadi avaigyanik rup se manorog chikitsakon kaa kaary kar rahe hai
 General practitioners and medical specialists are often unable to identify psychiatrists at the right time and send patients to the psychiatrist
 iske kai kaaran hai; jinke pramukh hai : dhan lolupata, aparyaapt jaankaree, aparyaapt prashikshan, manochikitsakon kii kami, garibi, rogi yaa uske rishtedaaron dwaara manorog ko sweekaar na karnaa, aadi
 Newspapers and other media have also failed to give accurate information about the psychiatrists
 parinamswaroop logon main in rogon ke bare main dar va agyanta kii galat dharanaen dur nahin hui hai
 There are only about 4000 psychiatric doctors in India with more than 100 crore population
 yah sankhya bahut kam he
 There are 42 psychiatric hospitals in India with about twenty thousand beds

 But a lot of time of psychiatrists and a lot of assistance to psychiatric hospitals is spent in the treatment of addicts

 Purely carving involves a metal plate covered with a wax surface that is resistant to acid

 ek tirchhe andakaar anubhag vaale ek upkaran, echop kaa bhi istemaal "phuli hui" linon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 The plate is then immersed in a tub of acid technically called mordant or etchant, or else it is washed with acid
 acid, dhaatu ke ke ujagar hisse ko "katata" he or plate main dubi hui line hi bachi rah jaati hai
 The remaining surface is then cleaned of the plate
 samoochee plate main syaahi lagaai jaati he or kuch samay baad sataha se syaahi ko hataa diya jaataa he, is prakaar nakkashi kii gayi linon main keval syaahi bachi rah jaati he
 The plate is then placed inside a high-pressure printing press with a sheet of paper
 paper nakkashi kii gayi linon se syaahi ko sokh letaa he or ek print taiyaar ho jaataa he
 This process can be repeated several times, usually several hundred impressions can be printed before the plate gives enough indication of wear
 plate par kiye gaye kaam ko puri prakriya ko doharaate hue bhi joda ja saktaa he; isse ek aisi eaching taiyaar hoti he jo ek se alag avasthaaon main maujuud rahata he
 Etching is often included with other intaglio techniques such as engraving or aquatint

 As such, the ornate decoration of armor in Germany was an art that was probably brought from Italy around the end of the 15th century, shortly before Etching developed as a print-making technique
 mana jaataa he ki print taiyaar karne main upyog kii jane vaali prakriya ke rup main iskaa avishkaar osberg, germany ke danniel hoper dwaara kiya gaya tha
 Hofer was a craftsman who embellished armor in this way and used this method to print prints using iron plates
 In addition to his print, there are two certified examples of his artwork on the armor: a 1536 shield now present in Real Armeria, Madrid, and a sword housed at the Germanische National Museum in Nuremberg
 german aitihaasik sangrahalay, berlin main 1512 or 1515 ke bich kii taarikh kaa ek ogsburg ghode kaa kavach maujuud he jise hoper kii eaching or lakdi ke tukdon se bani akritiyon se alankrita kiya gaya he lekin iskaa koi pramaan maujuud nahin he ki hoper ne swayan is par kaam kiya tha kyonki unke alankrita print zyaadaatar vibhinn media main anya shilpakaaron ke liye patterns ke rup main taiyaar kiye gaye the
 The switch to copper plates was probably made in Italy, and etching soon became a challenge for engraving as the most popular medium for print-making artists
 iskaa sabase bada faaydaa yah tha ki engraving ke vipareet, jisamen dhaatu par nakkashi ke liye vishesh kaushal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, eaching drawing main prashikshit kisi kalakaar ke liye ek apekshaakrit aasaani se sikhi jane vaali kala he
 Jack Calotte of Nancy, based in Lorraine, made significant technical advances in etching techniques
 unhone antim sire par ek tirchhe andakaar bhaag ke saath ek prakaar kii eaching sui, echap viksit kii jisane nakkashi waalon ke liye ek moti line taiyaar karne main madad kii jo utkeern karne waalon ke liye sambhav tha
 It seems that he also prepared a modified, hardened, recipe for the etching surface, using bean makers' varnish instead of a wax-based formula
 isane linon ko or adhik gahare kaate jane laayak bana diya jisase printing kii aayu bad gayi or saath hi "kharaab-kataai" ke khatre ko bhi kaaphi had tak kam kar diya, jahaan acid sataha ke andar us jagah tak pahunch jaataa tha jahaan ise nahin pahunchnaa chahie tha, jisase tasviir par dhabbe yaa dane taiyaar ho sakate the
 Previously there was always a risk of mal-harvesting in the mind of the etcher, so that he could not spend too much time on a single plate, this danger has been overcome in the harvesting process forever
 ab echar atyadhik vistrut kaam kar sakate hai jisapar pehle engrewaron kaa ekadhikaar tha or calot ne nai sambhaavnaaon kaa puri tarah istemaal karnaa sambhav bana diya
 He made more extensive and sophisticated use of many "stop-outs" than earlier achers
 yah sampurna plate par halke se acid kaat dene kii takanic he, jiske baad kalakriti ke un hisson kii stopping-out kii jaati he jise kalakaar dubaara acid main dubaane se pehle ground ke saath cover karte hue halke tone main rakhana chahta he
 With careful control of this process, he achieved unprecedented precision in distance and the effect of light and shade
 Most of his prints were relatively small - up to about six inches or 15 cm in their longest dimension, but packed with detail
 unke anuyaayiyon main se ek, paris ke abraham bose ne eaching ke pehle prakashit minial ke saath calot ke avishkaron ko puure europe main failaayaa jiskaa italvi, dach, german or angreji main anuwaad kiya gaya tha
 The 17th century was the great era of Etching in which Rembrandt, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, and many other nobles were born

 The revival of Etching in the 19th and early 20th centuries produced artists of lesser importance but not really a big name
 eaching aaj bhi vyapak rup se prachlit he
 a waxy acid-resistor, known as a ground, is mounted on a metal plate often made of copper or zinc, but a steel plate is another medium with varying quality
 ground ke do saamaanya prakaar hai: hard ground or soft ground Hard ground can be used in two ways
 thos hard ground ek sakht momyukt block main aata he
 To use hard ground on this variety, the plate to be carved is placed on a hot plate, a kind of metal working surface that is heated
 plate garm hota he or ground ko haathon se, plate par pighalaate hue ise lagaaya jaataa he
 The ground is spread on the plate by a roller as evenly as possible
 ek baar lagaae jane ke baad eaching plate ko garm-plate se hataa diya jaataa he or ise thandha hone diya jaataa he jo ground ko sakht kar detaa he
 After the ground hardens, the artist ideally "blows" the plate with three beeswax wax tapers so that the flame blackens the ground by placing it on the plate and it is easy to see which part of the plate is exposed
 is
 dhuna karne se na keval plate kaala ho jaataa he balki mom kii thodi maatra bhi isamen mil jaati he
 The artist later scratches the ground using a pointed tool and the metal is exposed
 hard ground ko lagane kaa doosraa tarika taral hard ground dwaara he
 It comes in a keg and is applied on a plate to be carved with a brush
 hawa main khulaa rakhane par hard ground sakht ho jaataa he
 Some printers use oil / coal-based asphaltum or bitumen as hard ground, although bitumen is often used to protect steel plates from rust and copper plates from aging
 soft ground bhi taral rup main aata he or ise sukhaya jaataa he lekin yah hard ground kii tarah bilkul shushk nahin hota he or apana prabhaav chhod saktaa he
 After the soft ground is dried, the printer can use some materials on it such as leaves, objects, hand prints and similar items that pierce the soft ground and the plate below it comes out
 ground ko powder yukt rogin yaa spray paint kaa istemaal karte hue ek fine mist main bhi lagaaya ja saktaa he
 This process is called aquatint and helps to create tones, shadows and solid areas of color
 iske baad ek eaching sui yaa apak se dizin taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 The "acup" point can be drawn by a simple tempered steel etching needle at an angle of 45–60 degrees behind a carborundum stone
 "echap" usee siddhant par kaam karata he jisase ki ek fountain pen kii line ballpoint kii tulana main kahin adhik aakarshak lagati he: swelling main halkaa sa antar haath kii swaabhaavik harakat ke kaaran hota he jo line ko "garm" kar detaa he or haalanki kisi vyaktigat line main yah shaayad hi miltaa he, antim plate par kul milakar ek bahut hi aakarshak prabhaav chodta he
 It can be prepared in the same manner as an ordinary needle
 iske baad plate ko puri tarah se ek acid main dubaaya jaataa he jo ujagar kii gayi dhaatu ko saafe kar detaa he
 Ferric chloride can be used for etching on copper or zinc plates while nitric acid can be used for etching on zinc or steel plates
 vishesh prakaar ke gholon main 2 bhaag fecl3 main 2 bhaag pani or 1 bhaag nitric main 3 bhaag pani kaa hota he
 The capacity of the acid determines the speed of the etching process
 eaching kii prakriya ke dauraan mudrak gholne kii prakriya main taiyaar bulabulon or aparad ko hataane ke liye chidiya kii pankh yaa aisi hi kisi cheez kaa upyog karte hai, plate kii sataha se yaa plate ko samay-samay par acid ke tub main dubaakar nikaala ja saktaa he
 If the bubble is allowed to remain on the plate, it prevents the acid from harvesting in the plate where the bubble touches it
 tambe or steel kii tulana main jasta kahin adhik teji se bulbule paidaa karata he or kuch kalakaar apane printon main ek miki ve effect ke liye ek rochak golakaar bulbule-jaisaa gola taiyaar karne main iskaa upyog karte hai
 Zinc produces more bubbles more quickly than copper and steel and some artists use it to produce interesting round bubble-like circles within the print for a galaxy effect
 aparad ek buknidaar pighali hui dhaatu he jo nakkashi kiye gaye grouves ko bhar detaa he or yah acid ko plate kii khuli hui satahon main ek saamaan tareeke se kaate jane se roak detaa he
 Another way to remove the erosion from the plate is to place the carved portion of the plate on the plasticine balls or stones inside the acid, although one drawback of this technique is the failure of bubbles to come out and remove them immediately
 equatinting ke liye mudrak aksar lagbhag ek centimetre se teen centimetre chaude dhaatu ke ek test strip kaa upyog karte hai
 The strip is immersed in acid for a specific number of minutes or seconds
 iske baad dhaatu kii is pattee ko hataa diya jaataa he or acid ko pani se dhokar saafe kar diya jaataa he
 a portion of the bandage will be covered in the ground and then the strip will be dipped again in acid and this process will be repeated again
 After this, the ground will be removed from the strip and ink will be put on the strip and printed
 This will allow the printer to know the different degrees or depth of the carved shape and therefore the color capacity of the ink depends on how long the plate has been kept in acid
 plate ko acid se hataa diya jaataa he or acid ko hataane ke liye ise pani se dhoyaa jaataa he
 The ground is removed with a solvent such as turpentine
 tarpin ko aksar mithail yukt spirits kaa upyog kar plate se hataaya jaataa he kyonki tarpin chikna hota he or syaahi ke prayog evam plate kii printing ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Spit-biting is a process whereby the printers use acid on a plate through a brush in certain areas of the plate
 is uddeshy ke liye plate ko equatint kiya ja saktaa he yaa sidhe acid ke sampark main laayaa ja saktaa he
 This process is called "spite-baiting" because it uses saliva that was once used to dilute acids, although gum arabic or water is now commonly used
 ek plastic card, mat board kaa ek tukdaa yaa kapade kaa ek guchha aksar syaahi ko chhin linon main pravesh karaane ke liye istemaal kiya jaataa he
 The surface is then cleaned with a piece of stiff fabric called tarlatan and then cleaned with newsprint paper, some printers prefer to use the blade portion of their hand or palm at the base of their thumb
 Huh

 You can also use a folded piece of organza silk for final cleaning
 agar tambe yaa jaste kii platon kaa upyog kiya jaataa he to plate kii sataha bahut saaf ho jaati he or isiliye yah print main safed hota he
 If a steel plate is used, the natural teeth of the plate give the print a smooth background, similar to the effect of aquatinting
 iske parinaam swarup steel platon ko equatinting kii jarurat nahin hoti he kyonki acid main lagaataar dubaaye jane par plate kaa kramik anaavaran vahi parinaam degaa

 This system uses less than 2 volts of electricity, exposing uneven metallic crystals in the carved parts resulting in excellent retention of ink and the quality of the printed image is parallel to conventional acid methods

 Light-sensitive polymer plates allow photorealistic etching
 plate par plate saplir yaa kalakaar dwaara ek photo-sensitive coating kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Light is focused on the plate as a negative image to illuminate it

 Areas of the photo-h image can be stomped-out before etching to separate the final image from the plate, or once the plate is carved, it is removed or lightened by scraping or burnishing

 There are several ways for printers to control the effects of acids
 sabase aam taur par plate kii sataha ko ek sakht, momyukt "ground" se cover kar diya jaataa he jo acid kaa pratirodh karata he
 The printer then scraps the ground with a sharp point, exposing the metal lines that have been affected by the acid
 equatint ek aisa badlaav he jisamen ek khaas regin ko plate par ek saamaan tareeke se baant diya jaataa he, phir iske baad ek uniform lekin sateek ghanatv se kam ek screen ground taiyaar karne ke liye ise garm kiya jaataa he
 After etching, any exposed surface turns into a corroded surface
 vaise kshetra jo antim print main halke hote hai unhen acid bath ke bich varnishing dwaara sangrakshit kiya jaataa he
 Repeating the process of continuous varnishing and placing the plate in acid creates a toned area that is difficult or impossible to obtain by drawing on a waxy ground
 isamen chini yaa camp coffee ke ek seerup jaise ghol main maujuud diginon ko iske ek taral eaching ground yaa "stop out" varnish main lep kiye jane se pehle dhaatu kii sataha par paint kiya jaataa he
 Later, when the plate is placed in hot water, the sugar dissolves and leaves the image and comes out
 iske baad plate par nakkashi kii ja sakati he
 a mixture of clean acid and gum arabic that can be dripped, scattered, or painted on a metal surface to produce interesting results
 yah ek america mudrak rand hubsh dwaara 2006 main avishkaar kii gayi ek eaching takanic he
 Small particles of carborundum grit are mixed into an acid-resistant ground that is brushed onto the bare metal as usual and left to dry
 jab vah mishran suukh jaataa he to plate par metal stilas kaa prayog kiya jaataa he or is tarah kuch dhul kanon ko hataa diya jaataa he, jisase kii tambe ke maamuli kshetra acid main ujagar ho jaaen or nakkashi kii ja sake, antat ve mudran prakriya ke liye syaahi ko pakad lete hai
 Thus the texture of the image on the paper is similar to the drawing of charcoal

 The wet paper is placed on a plate and operated by putting both into a printing press; Pressure brings the paper into contact with the ink and the image is transferred
 Unfortunately this pressure also spoils the image in the plate to some extent, smoothing the corroded areas and closing the lines; The copper plate is far better, so that several hundred prints of a well-carved image can be taken before the artist considers the defect too much
 waisi sthiti main kalakaar plate ko haathon se ek baar phir se nakkashi karke dubaara taiyaar kar saktaa he, anivaary rup se ground ko peeche kar or unki linon ko dubaara talashkar; vaikalpik taur par printing se pehle sataha kii suraksha ke liye ek sakht dhaatu se platon ko electro-plate kaa swarup diya ja saktaa he
 Zinc is also used because the time of carving as a soft metal is short, although this softening also causes the image to deteriorate rapidly
 fox-bite yaa "over-biting" eaching main aam he or yah acid kii kam maatra kaa prabhaav he jo ground se hokar ris jaati he jisase sataha par maamuli daag or jalan kaa nishaan utpann ho jaataa he
 This accidental malfunction can be overcome by surface smoothness and polish, but artists often leave the fox-bite or willfully using the plate poorly because it is used as a desirable mark of a process Is seen as "kya aap yahan aakar meri echings ko dekhnaa chahengi?", yah ek romantic muhaavara he jisamen ek purush kisi kalatmak cheez dikhaane ke bahaane ek mahila ko apane sthaan par bulaane kii koshish karata he

 Aitareya Brahmins have told about the relationship of Kashyapas to Janamejaya
 shatapath brahman main prajapati ko kashyap kaha gaya he: In the Mahabharata and Puranas, the description of the origin and lineage of the Asuras states that one of the six Manas sons of Brahma was 'marichi' who, by his will, gave birth to a Prajapati son named Kashyapa
 kashyap ne daksh prajapati kii 17 putriyon se vivaah kiya
 Following is the description of the child born to these daughters of Daksha: bhagwat puraana, markendeya puraana ke anusaar kashyap kii baarah bharyaayein thim

 It is a very broad tribe
 jiskaa gotra nahin miltaa uske liye kashyap gotra kii kalpana kar lee jaati he, kyonki ek parampara ke anusaar sabhi jeevadhariyon kii utpatti kashyap se hui
 Once conquered the whole earth, Parashuram donated it to Kashyapa Muni

 Therefore, following the Guru's orders, Parashurama resolved not to stay on the earth at night
 ve prati raatri main man ke samaan teevr gamanshakti se mahendra parvat par jane lage
 Daksha Prajapati had two daughters in the Satyuga - Kadru and Vinata
 un donon kaa vivaah maharishi kashyap ke saath hua
 Once pleased, Kashyap asked both of them to ask for the desired groom
 kadru ne samaan parakramee ek sahastra naag-putr maange tathaa vinata ne uske putron se adhik tejasvi do putr maange
 Later, both received one thousand and two eggs respectively
 500 varsh baad kadru ke andon ke naag prakat hue
 Vinata jealously broke one of her eggs on her own

 Seeing a horse named Uchhashrava there, they both got the condition that anyone who misrepresented her color would become the maid of the other
 agle din ghode kaa rang dekhne kii baat rahi
 Vinata had described his color as white and Kadru had described his color as white, but the tail as black
 kadru ke man main kapat tha
 On his way home, he ordered his sons to wear black hair on his tail so that he would emerge victorious
 jin sarpon ne uskaa aadesh nahin mana, unhen usne shaap diya ki ve janamejay ke yajna main bhasma ho jaayen
 While approving this curse, Brahma called Kashyapa and said - 'the number of snakes you have produced has increased a lot
 tumhaari patni ne unhen shaap dekar acha hi kiya, at: tum usase rusht mat hona
 By saying this, Brahma gave Kashyapa the knowledge to remove the poison of snakes

 After killing both of them, he picked up Amritghat and took it away

 Garuda also accepted to be the vehicle of Vishnu
 maarg main indra mili
 Indra asked for the nectar and said that if the snakes drank it, they would be extremely hurt
 garud ne indra ko bataaya ki vah kisi uddeshy se amrit le ja rahaa he
 When he puts the elixir somewhere, Indra takes it
 indra ne prasann hokar garud ko vardaan diya ki sarp uski bhojan saamagree honge
 Later Garuda reached his mother
 usne sarpon ko soochna di ki vah amrit le aayaa he
 Release the snake plea from slavery and take a bath
 usne kushasan par amrit-kalash rakh diyaan jab tak sarp snaan karke laute, indra ne amrit chura liya tha
 The snakes licked Kusha itself, causing two parts of their tongue, so they started to be called Dwijivah

 Unhappy, Balkhilya gave part of his penance to Kashyapa Muni and asked him to destroy the item of Indra

 They used to contaminate the future even when both the sages refused
 at: unke shaap se ve nadiyaan ban gayin
 On returning, Kashyap came to know

 When Shiva was pleased, he was blessed that both the rivers would join the Ganges and assume female form again
 aisa hi hone par prajapati kashyap ne donon kaa simantonnayan sanskaar kiya
 At the time of the yajna, Kadru ridiculed the rishis by pointing with one eye
 at: unke shaap se vah kani ho gayi
 Kashyap again pleased the sages in some way
 unke kathananusaar ganga snaan se usne pun: purvarup dhaaran kiya

 As detailed in Super Man: At the end of the film DVD special effects documentary 'the Magic Behind the Cape', presented by optical effects supervisor Roy Fields, three techniques were used to achieve flight effects

 Shots where the cameras are stationary and Superman is shown flying towards or away from the frame, blue screen matte shots were used
 reeve ko nile parade ke prati photograph kiya gaya
 Whereas a special instrument would show his cloak flapping so that there was an illusion of motion, while the performer would remain stationary
 Instead, the camera uses a mixture of long zoom-in and zoom-out so that they look smaller or larger in the frame
 The blue background was then photochemically removed and Reeve's image alone was 'inserted' into the matte area of the background plate shot
 Zoom-in or zoom-out give the impression of flying away from or near the background plate material
 These scenes are characterized by an asymmetry in light and color between the matte image and the background plate, the occasional appearance of black matte lines, and a slight unreliability of the impressions of motion achieved through the use of long zoom lenses
 shots, jahaan camera udate hue superman kaa peechha kar rahe hon frant projection kaa istemaal kiya gaya
 This includes portraits of artists hanging in front of a background image projected in dim light in front of a 3m-ready special screen, reflecting directly into the camera / projector combined with many times more loudness than the original
 This resulted in a much clearer and sharper shadow image of both the actors and the background plate, with fewer image distortion or lighting problems than rear projection
 ek takanic viksit kii gai jisamen vishesh rup se dizine kiye gaye zum lenson ke saath frant projection prabhaav ko sanyojit kiya gaya

 The second segment, set in Smallville, is reminiscent of films from the 1950s and its small-town atmosphere offers a painting of Norman Rockwell

 Donner, Tom Mankiewicz and Ilya Salkind have commented on the use of Christian references to discuss the subject matter of Superman
 mancuvikz ne jaan-boojh kar jor-el or kaal-el ke bich saadrishyata ko poshit kiya he
 Donner is somewhat skeptical of Mankiewicz's work, jokingly stating "I have received death threats because of it
 " Many concepts and imaginations have been used in biblical comparisons
 jor-el kryptone se general zod ko nikaal detaa he, jiske samanaantar shaitan kaa swarg se nikaal diya janaa he
 The spacecraft that brings kaal-el to Earth is similar in size to the star

 martha kent kahati he, "itane varshon se hamane kitni prarthanaayen kii ki bhagwaan hamen baccha dene kaa anugrah karen," jisaki tulana virgin meri se kii jaati he
 Just as little is known about Jesus' teenage years, Clarke wanders into the rugged to find out who he is and what he has to do
 jor-el kehete hai, "unamem se ek ke rup main jeeyo, taaki jaan sako ki tumhaari taaqat or shakti kii zarurat kahaan he
 But always hold the pride of your special heritage in your heart

 sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar ko adhyayan kar lene ke falswaroop ve prabandh kshetra main adhik safal ho sakate hai
 Organizational behavior as a separate discipline of knowledge has recently been recognized and the shortcomings of scientific management have been the basic basis of its development
 vikaas kii praarambhik avasthaa main prabandhkeey vyavhaar karmchaariyon ke manobal evam sahyog tak hi simit tha, jise ‘maanviya sambandhon’ ke naam se janaa jaataa tha
 In this state, man was considered a 'living being' and his physical and psychological needs were met by the managers
 tatpashchaat 1929 i
 kii mahaan mandi, shram aandolan tathaa havthorn prayogon ne maanviya sambandh aandolan ko vyapak rup se prabhavit kiya tathaa prabandhakon ko yah sochane hetu vivash kiya ki ve ‘manushya ke vyavhaar’ ko sarvocch praathamikta pradaan karen tathaa use vyavasthit rup se samajhane evam jaanane kaa prayaas karen
 Human relations ideology has played an important role in making management a form of behavioral science
 george ilton mayo, rothaliswarger tathaa wiliam je
 dikson ne 1924 se 1933 i
 kii avadhi main is disha main anek mahatvapurn prayog kiye, jinhen ‘havthorn prayog’ ke naam se janaa ja ta he
 Following are the major findings of these experiments - vastav main, havthorn pareekshanon ne prabandhkeey vichaardhaara ko ek nai disha pradaan kii he
 These tests have led to the elimination of many misconceptions and fanciful assumptions, and the social and psychological needs of workers are being systematically considered
 maanviya sambandh vichaardhaara ko aage badhaane main meri parker, folate, oliver, shildon, barnard, simon, argirisadi kaa bhi mahatvapurn yogadan rahaa he
 Foulette has done important work on the 'psychology of relationships' and has emphasized leadership, creative struggle, participation, socializing, group thinking and adoption of new democratic values

 Especially in the period from 1960 to 1970 AD, many behavioral scientists have worked on various aspects of management, in which social interaction, motivation, communication, leadership, work restructuring, variety of work life, etc
 is prominent and the employee is an economic or social human being
 Is instead accepted as a 'complex human being'
 in vidwaanon ne yah batalaaya he ki aadhunik vyakti kaary, maansik santushti tathaa aatm-vikaas se prerit hota he
 Kurt Lewin has particularly emphasized behavior, sophistication, motivation and group dynamics, while Rensis Likerton considers the employee to be human rather than a machine and instead of 'work-centered supervision' to produce more 'employee- Special emphasis has been laid on 'focused supervision'
 duglas mexgrager ne maanviya vyavhaar ke sambandh main do paraspar virdohi ko prastut kiya he, jabaki abraham maslo ne bataaya he ki vyakti ek nishchit kram main hi apni aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye prayaas karata he
 Herzberg has laid special emphasis on motivational elements, presenting the two-component ideology
 victor ech
broom ne sanghathanon main vyavhaar kaa manovaigyanik vishleshan kiya he tathaa kaary vyavhaar, abhiprerana, kaary santushti, kaary nishpaadan, bhoomika, netritv aadi kaa vishleshan karte hue maanviya vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne vaale praudyogiki evam manovaigyanik ghatakon main upyukt santulan sthapit karne par bal diya he
 In short, the following are the key elements of the behavioral science ideology
 1949 : samooh vaataavaran kaa levin kaa adhyayan 1951: Publication of Ohio Leadership Studies 1958 : feedler kii netritv pravritiyaan tathaa samooh prabhaavashiltaa kaa prakaashan 1967: Publication of organization and environment of Lawrence and Larch
 1964 : broom kaa kaary evam abhiprerana kaa prakaashan 1960: Publication of Kekgregor's Human Side of Enterprise 1973 : mintgeberg kaa prakaashan prabandhkeey kaary kii prakruti 1978: Publication of Fifer and Salsnik - External control of organizations 1981 : wiliam aunchi kaa prakaashan- theory jed The above three considerations make it clear that the following three things are clear: First, modern organizational behavior emphasizes that employees are automatically motivated to do better if suitable working conditions are provided
 aisi dashaon main karmchaaree sanghathan ke prati patibaddh hote hai tathaa vaanchit dashaon main apane vyavhaar ko viksit karte hai
 If there are opposite conditions, they may adopt the following positive behavior style
 baraan tathaa greenberg kaa mat he ki aadhunik sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar kaary hetu ‘rose tinted glasses’ ko nahin maanata he
 It states that work conditions that provide joy and satisfaction can be created and employees can be encouraged to do creative work on the job
 duusare shabdon main, kaary dashaon main vyaktiyon ke vyavhaar ko vaanchit dishaao main modaa ja saktaa he
 Second, modern organizational behavior is based on the contingency ideology
 yah maanati he ki nimna prashnon kaa sahi uttar paristhitiyon par nirbhar karata he- Contingency ideology holds that behavior in work conditions is a complex result of many interacting forces
 vyaktigat visheshtaayen, paristhityatmak ghatak, sanghathanaatmak samskruti, vyaktiyon evam samoohon ke madhya bhootkaaleen evam vartmaan sambandh tathaa vidyaman sanghathanaatmak sanrachana aadi sabhi ek vishisht sthiti tathaa samay main vyavhaar ko nirupit karti he tathaa prabhavit karti hai
 The third important feature of modern organizational behavior is that they are being widely adopted from an international perspective
 anterrashtriya pariprekshya se aashay vibhinn rashtron main kaary dashaon ke madhya behatar samaj tathaa uske prabhaav se he, jo sanghathan evam vyakti donon ko prabhavit karti hai
 Also, it includes how these differences are related to different cultures and societies
 is sandarbh main ek mahatvapurn vichaardhaara, wiliam aunchi dwaara pratipaadit ‘theory jad’ he
 Aunchi first described the major variations of Japanese and American corporations, and then attempted to relate these differences with different cultures and historical components
 isamen koi atishyokti nahin he ki ab visheshgyon dwaara sanghathanaatmak prabhaavashiltaa main saanskrithik ghatakon kii bhoomika par pramukhataa se dhyaan diya ja rahaa he
 The growing interdependence between different nations today gives recognition and acceptance of organizational behavior in international perspective
 sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar kaa dhaanchaa paanch tatwon se milakar banataa he
 Individuals work in organizations and individuals establish social order in the organization
 vyakti ekaaki tathaa samooh main ho sakate hai
 Groups can also be of different sizes, ie small, very large, very small
 kuch samooh aupchaarik hote he jo sanstha kii sanghathan sanrachana ke niyamon ke antargat banaaye jate hai
 There are also some other informal ones that the person doing the work creates or becomes self
 vyaktiyon ke samooh gatisheel hote hai
 Their mobility is continuously increasing as individuals are becoming more alert, alive, thoughtful and emotional
 ye vyakti hi sanghathanon kaa nirmaan karte hai taaki ve samuhik uddeshyon ko adhik kushalta se puraa kar saken
 The second element of organizational behavior is group and group processes
 samoohon kaa nirmaan vyaktiyon se hota he tathaa samooh chote tathaa bade ho sakate hai
 Group processes are conducted through communication, decision making, power and leadership
 vyakti, kaary evam praudyogiki teenon gahanta se jude hai
 Technology providing machines to work, machines, equipment, buildings, production systems etc
 are all included in the technology itself
 inhen sadhano se sanghathan main karyrat log apane kaaryo ko adhik suvidha evam kushalta se puraa kar pate hai
 The managers have to keep in mind that what is the response of the people to the technology of the work place and to the work of the person
 kaary sambandhon par bhautik va aarthik sansadhano, kaary kii takanic, upkaran, kaary-paddati aadi kaa atyadhik prabhaav pasta he
 Right technology helps in the work of the employee, but hard technology increases the physical and mental cost of performance
 sanghathan dizin kaary sambandhon ko paribhaashit karti he
 It determines the distribution of obligations and rights between individuals and their mutual relations
 sanghathan sanrachana jitani adhik prabhavi hogi karmchaariyon ke vyavhaar env nishpaadan ko utane hi achche dhang se samanvit env niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 Organization structure contributes to the fulfillment of tasks and objectives, but the success of organization structure is not easy
 This structure itself sometimes causes huge problems in coordination, cooperation, decision making etc
 sanghathan samaaj ke vibhinn prakaar ke vaataavaran main kaary karte hai
 The organization constantly interacts with the internal and external environment
 bahya vaataavaran kii bhi kai up-pranaliyaan hai jaiseh- sarkaar, samaaj, upabhokta, karmchaaree sanghathan, pratispardhi sansthaayen ityadi
 All sub-systems create the external environment of the organization and affect the functioning of each organization
 isse sanghathan main karyrat logon ke vyavhaar par prabhaav pasta he, sanghathan kii utpaadan pranali vipanan nitiyaan aadi bhi prabhavit hoti hai

 arthshaastra vikalp chayan evam nirnayan ke dwaara simit sansaadhanaa ke aavanton tathaa aarthik nitiyon ke nirdhaaran par bal dekar aarthik vikaas main yogadan karata he
 Economics thus provides important support in choosing options for organizational behavior, making decisions, optimally utilizing resources, etc
 sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar kaa adhyayan prabandh ke vyavahaaravaadi drushtikon kaa aadhaar he
 Through this, the manager knows why a person behaves in a certain way in a certain environment
 sanghathanaatmak vyavhaaron kii abhivyakti sanghathan gatishiltaa, sangharsh, parivartan evam samaayojan aadi ke rup main hoti he
 Practitioners are not unanimous in this regard as far as its field is concerned
 prabandh kii aakasmikta vichaardhaara yah batalaati he ki vaanchit vyavhaar kii maatra evam kism sanghathanaatmak vaataavaran tathaa iske sadasyon kii visheshtaon par nirbhar karata he
 Another ideology emphasizes that all organizations should develop certain ideals, such as participation, openness, etc
 maaikel bear kaa mat he ki sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar main sammilit muddon kii nishchit suchi bananaa sambhav nahin he, phir bhi iske kshetra main nimnlikhit vishyon ko sammilit kiya ja saktaa he- Fred Luthans holds that successful managers in American organizations pay special attention to the human side of management
 sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar ‘prabandh ke maanviya paksh’ ke adhyayan evam prayog se sambandhit he, jisamen nimnlikhit bindu sammilit hai- sanghathanaatmak samskruti, vyaktitv, avabodhan, pravritiyaan evam job santushti, kaary dabaav, abhiprerana, siikhnaa, sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar sanshodhan, aupchaarik evam anaupchaarik samooh, arntakriya vyavhaar evam sangharsh, shakti evam raajnneeti, netritv prakriya evam style, sampreshan, nirnayan evam niyantran, sanghathan siddhanth evam prarachana tathaa sanghathanaatmak parivartan evam vikaas
 Robbins and Keith Davis also included the management of changes, technology and individuals, variety of work life, equal, employment opportunity, pressure and counseling, economic motivational methods, etc
 in the field of organizational behavior
 sankshep main, sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar kaa kshetra dinon-din vyapak hota ja rahaa he
 Now it is emphasizing the 'entirety' of human behavior along with the individual, group and organization structure
 vyavahaaravaadi vaigyanik apana dhyaan sanghathanaatmak vichaardhaaraon, visheshtah sanghathanaatmak samaayojanshiltaa tathaa maanviya vyavhaaron par hi kendrit kar rahe hai
 The subject of Organizational Behavior is based on some basic ideas and concepts which are related to the nature of individuals and organizations
 ye vichaar sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar ke kshetra main prabhavi dhang se lagu hote hai, yadhyapi prabandh ke anya kshetron main bhi inkaa upyog hota he
 These are the following: 1
 vaiyaktik antar - vyakti kai drushti se samaan hai jaise unke dwaara sukh-dukh kaa abhas karnaa
 But still individuals differ from each other in private
 kushaagratha, vyaktitv, drushtikon, vichaar-chintan, saahas, dhairya, bauddhik str aadi kai gunon ko lekar vyakti bhinnata rakhte hai
 Their motivation and level of satisfaction also varies
 unke kaary karne evam parinaam praapt karne kaa dhang bhi alag-alag ho saktaa he
 Psychologists believe that "everyone is amazing"
 unki kaary kshamtaayen, seekhney va grahan karne kii kshamta aadi bhi bhinn-bhinn hai
 Therefore, the manager has to take decisions only with reference to each person and situation
 use koi bhi kaarywahi karte samay karmchaaree ke vyaktitv evam gun vishesh ke antaron ko dhyaan main rakhana chahie
 2
 Awabodh - Individuals see things and events differently
 vyaktiyon kaa najariya, drushtikon evam sochane-samajhane kaa tarika bhinn-bhinn hota he
 The vision and thinking of a person depends on his personality, needs, past experience, social environment, time period etc
 prayek vyakti ke vishwaason, mulyon evam apekshaaon kaa apana sansar hota he jiske madhyam se ve nirnay lete hai
 According to 'selected Awabodh' the person pays more attention only to the things relevant to his beliefs
 newstrom evam kith davis ke anusaar ‘‘prabandhakon ko apane karmchaariyon ke avabodh sambandhi antaron ko sweekaar karne tathaa vyaktiyon ko bhavpurn praaniyon ke rup main dekhne kaa prayaas karnaa chahie tathaa unke saath vaiyaktik dhang se vyavhaar karnaa chahie
 '' 3
 ek sampoorn vyakti - vyakti kaary-sthal par ‘sampoorn maanav’ ke rup main kaary karte hai
 a person is fully employed at work, only his 'work skills' are not used
 vyakti apni kaary yogyataon ke saath-saath apni bhaawanaaon, aavashyaktaaon, apane utsaah, drushtikon tathaa apane sampoorn astitv ko kaary sthal par saath lekar aata he
 Her home life cannot be separated from her work life
 karmchaaree apane samast gunon, avagunon, utsaah-niraashaaon, santushti va tanaavon evam ghar va baahar ke dabaavon ko kaarysthal par saath laata he, kyonki inhen alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the manager should accept his employees as 'whole human beings', that is, he should consider the qualities and functionality of the employees as well as their dissatisfaction, frustration, mental anguish, neglect-anorexia, inability etc
 4
 nimitt vyavhaar - prayek vyavhaar kaa koi kaaran hota he
 In other words, behind every behavior there is a purpose, for or purpose
 jab koi shramik apane suparvizer se vivaad karata he, yaa kaary par deree se aata he athwa kaary main nirantar trutiyaan karata he to yah akaaran nahin hota he
 Psychologists believe that "no behavior is accidental
" ’’ atah prabandhak ko karmchaariyon ke vyavhaar ke peeche nihit kaaran ko jaanate hue hi unke saath vyavhaar karnaa chahie
 5
 Desire to participate - Everyone deserves respect
 vah apni kshamta siddh karke mahatvapurn anubhav karnaa chahta he
 Every employee in the organization believes that he / she has the ability to work and can fulfill their roles and successfully face challenging situation
 aaj anek karmchaaree niti va nirnyon ke nirdhaaran main bhaag lenaa chaahate hai
 Therefore, the manager should keep in mind the work capacity, qualities and aspirations of the employees while dealing in the organization
 6
 vyakti ke prati nitigat vyavhaar - sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar vyakti kii garima evam uski naitik chhavi main vishwaas karata he
 One should not be considered merely a means of production
 manushya aarthik upkaran nahin he, varan atmik ikai he
 Therefore, they should not be treated objectively
 naitik nishpaadan kaa ucch str banaaye rakhaa janaa chahie
 They should be given opportunities for development
 ucch naitik vyavhaar ke liye karmchaariyon ko puraskrit kiya janaa chahie
 Every manager's decision regarding organizational behavior should be based on policy values

 sanghathan saamaajik pranaliyaan hai - sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar yah maanata he ki sanghathan saamaajik pranali he kyonki yah maanviya sambandhon se nirmit hota he tathaa saamaajik niyamon se niyantrit hota he
 The organization has psychological roles as well as level of social needs of individuals
 unka vyavhaar unki vaiyaktik evam samooh aavashyaktaaon donon se prabhavit hota he
 In fact, organizations have two types of systems - formal and informal
 saamaajik pranali se taatpary yah bhi he ki sanghathanaatmak vaataavaran gatisheel parivartanon se milakar banataa he
 Organization is not a framework of relationships built on paper
 sanghathan ke sabhi hisse anternirbhar tathaa prabhaavon ke adheen hote hai
 Each organ is connected to the other
 sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar isi vichaar par aadhaarit he
 8
 Mutuality of interests - Mutuality of interests lies in that "organizations need individuals and individuals need organizations
" ’’ sanghathanon kaa ek maanviya uddeshy hota he tathaa ve apane sadasyon ke hiton kii parsparikta ke aadhaar banaaye tathaa chalaaye jate hai
 Organizations that do not have mutuality of interests are just crowds
 parsparik hit ‘‘adhigaun lakshya’’ kii ore karmchaariyon ko prerit karte hai
 a learning goal is one that can only be achieved through the integrated efforts of individuals and employers
 jab sahyog evam daleey bhaavana hoti he to vyaktiyon ko kaary main adhik santushti praapt hoti he
 They feel in a position to learn, develop and contribute
 sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar adhyayan kaa ek naveen evam vikasshil kshetra he jo maanviya samasyaon ke samaadhaan main sakriya bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Using this knowledge, the manager achieves organizational goals along with meeting human needs and increases organizational effectiveness
 yah vishay anek simaaon se yukt he jiskaa pramukh kaaran manushya tathaa uskaa gatisheel vyavhaar he
 Human behavior is governed by thoughts and feelings and depends to a large extent on circumstances
 atah usko yatharth rup main samajhnaa, bhavishyavaanee karnaa tathaa is par niyantran karnaa ati jatil hota he
 Frustration, dissatisfaction and industrial conflicts cannot be completely resolved by this
 yah vichaardhaara simit shodh kaaryo tathaa pramaanon par aadhaarit he
 Therefore, it may not be helpful to achieve the desired results in all situations, although organizational behavior has become a widely accepted topic and approach, but it still has some limitations, some of which are as follows: - 1
 siddhanton par bal, vyavhaar par nahin - sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar adhikanshtah ek saiddhanthik vishay he, yah vyavhaar main sudhaar laane par adhik bal nahin detaa he
 2
 Descriptive only, not instructional - Organizational behavior is a descriptive subject only
 yah samasya samaadhaan ke liye koi hal, aadesh yaa nirdesh prastut nahin karata he yah samasyaon ke prakatikaran tak hi simit he
 3
 No improvement in industrial relations - Organizational behavior has not been successful in curbing industrial disputes, quarrels and production blockage activities in the subject matter
 sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar kii prakriyaaon ko lagu karne ke baavjood bhi sansthaaon main hadataalon, talabandi, todphod, dheraav jaisi dhatnaon main kami nahin ai he
 4
 Dual personality - In organizational behavior management, only dual character has been created
 prabandhak parivartan yaa vikaas ke naam par keval adarsh kii baaten karte hai kintu unka swany kaa vyavhaar doharaa hota he
 They insist on changing the behavior and attitudes of employees without bringing about changes in themselves
 prabandhak karmchaariyon ko naukar kaa darja dete hai va amanviya vyavhaar karte he
 All this reveals his double personality
 5
 pakshpaat - sanghathanaatmak vyavhaar main kuch vyaktiyon ke saath pakshpaat kii sambhaavna bani rahati he
 Those who are not judged remain unconcerned
 ve kaaryon ko karne tathaa uttardayitvon ke nirvaah main koi ruchi nahin lete hai
 Rajpur is a village in Raigal district under the state of Chhattisgarh, India, in the Laluga division
