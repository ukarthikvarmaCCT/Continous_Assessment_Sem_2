 Chronology or chronology is the science through which we can construct historical events
 isliye yah aavashyak he ki sab ghatnaon ko kisi ek hi sanvatsar main pradarshit kiya jaae
 Only by doing this can we find the sequence of all events and the time span between them
 yah sanvatsar koi bhi ho saktaa he—pracheen yaa arvachin
 Today, most of the year AD is used for this work
 hamaare yahan is kaam ke liye gatkali varsh prayukt hota tha or europe main, pracheen kaal main or kabhi-kabhi aajkal bhi, julian piriad vyavahrut hota he
 Different cultures were prevalent in different countries and diverse periods of the world
 itnaa hi nahin, bharat jaise vishaal desh main aajkal or bhootkaal main bhi bahut se sanwat prachlit the
 The propagation of all these Samvatas started in different periods and their years also started in different seasons
 iske atirikt varsh, maas or dinon kii gananaa kaa prakaar bhi bhinn tha
 Normally, the year was tried to be equal to the Riturachakra, but according to the Islamic period, it was only the year of the twelve lunar months, that is, 354 days, which is not the same as the Ritachakra
 kuch varsh chandra or saura ke mishran hote the, jaisaa aajkal bharat ke anek praanton main prachlit he
 It consists of a year of 12 lunar months, but in two or three years, a half-year is increased to make the middle value of the year equal to that of the season cycle
 prayek ritu-chakra-tulya varsh ko saura varsh bhi kehete hai, kyonki uskaa maan surya se sambhddha hota he
 The lunar month we have mentioned above should actually be called the solar moon, because its base is in combination with the sun and the moon
 poornima tak athwa amavasya se amavasya tak is chandramaada kaa maan hota he
 Just as Varshman's imagination is dependent on the seasons and the month's imagery is dependent on the arts of the Moon, similarly the day is conceived from sunrise, sunset, midnight or midnight
 saamanyat: ek madhyahn se aagaamee madhyahn ke madhya kaal ko ek din kehete hai
 Where the lunar month is prevalent, such as in different regions of India, dates are counted, which are primarily related to the arts of the moon
 is prakaar ham dekhte hai ki jagat ke vividh pradeshon main alag-alag sanwaton se gananaa hoti he, varsh kaa prarambh bhi bhinn-bhinn rituon main hota he or masganana tathaa dinaganana bhi vividh prakaar kii hoti he
 Now, if we read in an ancient inscription that that day was the most auspicious day of so-and-so month, then the question arises as to what day it was
 bahudhaa iskaa uttar paanaa kathin hota he, kyonki us sanwat kaa aarambh kab hua, uskaa varshmaan kya tha or uske maas tathaa din kis prakaar gine jate the, in sab baton kaa gyaan praapt kiye bina ham us din kaa kalnirnay nahin kar sakate
 Therefore, it is necessary that the beginning of different vows of the world, that is, the beginning of their first year, should be told in any one of the certified vows
 jagat main pracheen kaal se aaj tak bahut se sanvatsar chalate aae hai
 The instruction of them all is the subject of a detailed article
 at: parishisht main bharat ke pracheen evam arvachin kuchhek mukhya sanwaton ke prarambh kaa kaal hi denge
 Nowadays there is a system of giving the period of most events in the year AD
 isvi san ke purv kii ghatnaon kaa nirdesh karne ke liye ham "i

' aksharon kaa vyavhaar karte hai
 It is the practice of historians that the year before 1 AD was the year 1 BC
 The year is called uske purv ke varsh ko 2 i
pus
 kehete hai—ityadi
 But according to the principles of Mathematics, this practice is unscientific; Because from this, as an example, 3 BC Between 5 and 2 CE, 5 years were spent, there is such confusion, while in reality the gap is only 4 years
 isiilie ganitagya or jyotishi log is kalganana ke sthaan main anya prakaar kii gananaa kaa upyog karte hai

 Here we will only describe till the census
 saamaanya manyata yah he ki isvi san isa messiah ke janm se gina jaataa he, parantu katipay vidwaanon ke matanusaar usamen lagbhag 4 varsh kii bhul he
 There is an important context in the calculation of AD, due to which, there is a possibility of mistake of up to 13 days in the census
 aajkal samaanyat: i
 san varsh main 365 din hote hai or prati chaar varshon main ek varsh 366 din kaa hota he
 The 4 centuries have 366 days in just one century in 4 years
 shatabdiyon ke dinon kii yah vishisht vyavastha pracheen kaal main nahi thi
 By 1582 AD, one year per four years was counted as 366 days in all the years including the century
 365 din ke varsh ko saamaanya varsh tathaa 366 din ke varsh ko adhivarsh kehete hai
 In 1582 AD, Pope Gregory made two reforms in AD
 pratham sudhaar yah tha ki shatabdiyon ke dinon kii vyavastha naveen rup se kii gai, jo aajkal prachlit he
 The system was that the century which can be divided from 400 to the remaining is the leap year; All other centuries are normal years
 yah niyam jyotish ke aadhunik yantron se paane gaye sookshm sayan varshmaan ke anusaar kiya gaya he
 By neglecting this rule, 10 days were extended from the beginning of the year AD to 1582 AD
 is nayi vyavastha ko naveen paddati or purv kii paddati ko pracheen paddati kehete hai
 In chronology, the events up to October 4, 1582 AD are expressed in the ancient way and the events after that in the new method
 nai style, puraani style, chute hue din, adhivarsh aadi kii jhanjhaton se bachane ke liye jyotishi bahudhaa julian dinaank se samay suchit karte hai
 This method was introduced by the French astrologer Scalier

 navik panchangon main prayek din kaa julian dinaank diya rahata he
 In the Appendix, the beginning of various cultures is given in the year AD
 uski sahaayta se us sanwat main die hue kaal ko ham i

 Normally, it has been said that as far as we do not know the mathematics of the year, mass and census of that entity, E
 Sun
 We cannot decide the exact date of
 parishisht main keval ek hi sanwat aisa he jiskaa varshmaan i
 san ke varshmaan se bahut bhinn he : vah hijri san he, jiske varsh kaa madhya maan 354
37 din he
 Some others are of Samvat and Chandra Maan, but in two or three years, by increasing the maximum, they usually become equal to AD
 phir bhi thode dinon kaa antar rah jaataa he
 In which month of the year AD, the year of these seasons begins, it is also mentioned in the Appendix
 isse saamanyat:, lagbhag ek maas ke bheetar, i
 san kaa maas bhi gyaat ho jayega
 For example, in the Shravan month of Vikram Samvat 1932 in Uttar Pradesh, which year and month of the year, we can find out from the Appendix
 parishisht main yah bataaya gaya he ki is sanwat kaa varsharambh i
 san ke -57 varsh ke april maas main hua tha
 Accordingly, the 1932 year of this Vikram Samvat would have started in August, ie, Chaitra month in 1857
 isse adhik is parishisht se ham nahin jaan sakate
 To know with certainty the month and month of AD, we should also get acquainted with the mathematics of the month and day of Vikram Samvat, which is mentioned in the article titled "pachang and Panchagapaddhati"

 The early period of Han Dynasty is called Western Han
 During this period, the Han emperors had spread the borders of China far and wide, bringing many parts of Central Asia and Korea under China

 mahila evam bal vikaas mantralay bharat sarkaar Rama is recognized as an incarnation of God in ancient India
 hindu dharm main ram vishnu ke das avtaron main se saatven avatar hai
 The life and might of Rama is described as the Sanskrit epic Ramayana composed by Maharishi Valmiki
 goswami tulsidas ne bhi unke jivan par kendrit bhakthibhaavpurn suprasiddh mahakavy shri ramcharitamanas kii rachana kii he
 Apart from these two, Ramayana has also been composed in other Indian languages, which are also very famous
 khaas taur par uttar bharat main ram atyant poojyaneey hai or adarsh purush hai
 They are also embellished with the term Purushottam
 ram, ayodhya ke raja dasharath or rani kaushalya ke sabase bade putr the
 Ram's wife was named Sita and had three brothers - Lakshmana, Bharata and Shatrughna
 hanuman, bhagwaan ram ke, sabase bade bhakt maane jate hai
 Rama killed Ravana, the king of Lanka
 ram kii pratishtha maryaada purushottam ke rup main he
 Rama left the kingdom, friends, parents, even wife to follow decorum
 inkaa parivaar adarsh bhartiya parivaar kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Ram was born in Raghukul, whose tradition was that of Pran Jahun Baru Bachnu Na Jai
 shriram ke pita dasharath ne unki sauteli mata kaikeyi ko unki kinhin do ichchhaaon ko puraa karne kaa vachan diya tha
 Kaikeyi came under the guise of maid Manthara as these vars asked King Dasaratha for his son Bharata for the throne of Ayodhya and fourteen years of exile for Rama
 pita ke vachan kii raksha ke liye ram ne khushi se chaudaa varsh kaa vanvaas sweekaar kiya
 Wife Sita thought it appropriate to go to the forest with her husband, giving the example of the ideal wife
 bhai lakshmana ne bhi ram ke saath chaudaa varsh van main bitaye
 Bharata rejects Mata's order for justice and goes to the elder brother Rama in the forest and brings him to his feet
 phir ise hi raaj gaddi par rakh kar rajkaaj kiya
 When Ram was a forest dweller, his wife Sita took Ravana away
 jangal main ram ko hanuman jaisaa mitra or bhakt mila jisane ram ke saare kaary puure karaaye
 Rama finds Sita with the help of monkeys
 samudr main pul bana kar lanka pahunche tathaa ravan ke saath yuddh kiya

 Ram was justice-loving

 His two sons Kush and Love handled their kingdoms
 hindu dharm ke kai tyohaar, jaise dashahra, ram navami or deepawali, ram kii jivan-katha se jude hue hai
 The word 'ram' is derived from the addition of the suffix 'ghan' in 'rum' metal
 'ram' dhaatu kaa arth raman karne se sambaddh he
 They 'raman' in the heart of a creature, therefore 'ram' and devotees 'raman' in them, therefore they are also 'ram'
 'vishnusahasranam' par likhit apane bhashya main aadya shankaracharya ne padmapurana kaa hawala dete hue kaha he ki nityanandswarup bhagavan main yogijan raman karte hai, isliye ve 'ram' hai
 Rama is not mentioned in Vedic literature in the prevailing form
 rugveda main keval do sthalon par hi 'ram' shabd kaa prayog hua he 
 One of them has been used in the meaning of black in one place and the remaining one in the meaning of person; But there is also no indication of his being an avatar man or Dasaratha-son
 yadhyapi nilkanth chaturdhar ne rugveda ke anek mantron ko swavivek se chunakar unke ramakthaparak arth kiye hai, parantu yah unki nijee manyata he
 The Ramakathaparaka meaning of those mantras has not been proved by any indication or any other commentary received in those cases of Rigveda itself
 rugveda main ek sthal par 'ikshvakuh' kaa tathaa ek sthal par 'dasharath' shabd kaa bhi prayog hua he
 But there is no indication of his association with Rama
 brahman sahitya main 'ram' shabd kaa prayog aitarey brahman main do sthalon par hua he; parantu vahaan unhen 'raamo margveyah' kaha gaya he, jiskaa arth acharya sayan ke anusaar 'mrigavu' naamak stri kaa putr he
 The word 'ram' is used at a place in the Shatapatha Brahmin
 yahan 'ram' yajna ke acharya ke rup main he tathaa unhen 'ram auptpasvini' kaha gaya he
 This means that the incarnation of the prevalent Rama is due to the Valmiki Ramayana and the Puranas

 Here only the position of Jupiter and Moon are clear
 brihaspati ucchsth he tathaa chandramaa swagruhi
 Further in the fifteenth verse, the Sun is mentioned to be high
 is prakaar brihaspati tathaa surya ke ucch hone kaa pataa chal jaataa he
 Mercury is always near the Sun
 atah surya ke ucch hone par buddha kaa ucch hona asambhav he
 In this way, the remaining three planets - Mars, Venus and Saturn are left to grow higher
 isi kaaran se praayah sabhi vidwaanon ne ram-janm ke samay main surya, mangal, brihaspati, shukr tathaa shani ko ucch main sthit mana he
 Traditionally, Rama's birth is believed to be in Treta Yuga
 hindu dharamshastron main, visheshtah puranic sahitya main uplabdh aankadon ke anusaar ek chaturyugi main 43,20,000 varsh hote hai, jinamein kaliyug ke 4,32,000 varsh tathaa dwapar ke 8,64,000 varsh hote hai
 Rama was born in Treta Yug i
e
 before Dwapara
 chunki kaliyug kaa abhi prarambh hi hua he or ram kaa janm treta ke ant main hua tathaa avatar lekar dharti par unke vartmaan rahane kaa samay paramparaagat rup se 11,000 varsh mana gaya he
 Hence 8,64,000 years of Dwapara Yuga + 11,000 years of Rama's existence + 5,100 years since the end of Dwapara Yuga = 8,80,100 years in total
 atev paramparaagat rup se ram kaa janm aaj se lagbhag 8,80,100 varsh pehle mana jaataa he
 Eminent Marathi researcher scholar Dr
 Padmakar Vishnu Vartak has considered this time probable from a point of view
 unka kahana he ki valmikiy ramayana main ek sthal par vindhyachal tathaa himalay kii oonchaai ko samaan bataaya gaya he
 The height of Vindhyachal is 5,000 feet and it is almost constant, while the height of the Himalayas is currently 29,029 feet and it is continuously growing
 donon kii oonchaai kaa antar 24,029 feet he
 According to experts, the Himalayas grow 3 feet in 100 years
 atah 24,029 feet badhane main himalay ko kareeb 8,01,000 varsh lage honge
 Hence, the height of the Himalayas must have been similar to that of Vindhyachal, about 8,01,000 years ago, which is mentioned in the present-day form in Valmiki Ramayana
 is tarah da0 vartak ko ek drushti se yah samay sambhav lagata he, parantu unka swayan maananaa he ki ve kisi anya strot se is samay kii pushti nahin kar sakate hai
 In his well-known treatise 'vaastav Ramayana', Dr
 Vartak has done the math on the basis of the planets, according to the planetary position mentioned in the Valmiki Ramayana, to determine the actual birth date of Rama on 4 December 7323 BC
 unke anusaar isi tithi ko din main 1:30 se 3:00 baje ke bich ram kaa janm hua hoga
 After several years of research by Dr
 p
v
vartak, a research team of 'i-serve' proved Shri Ram's birth on 10 January 5114 BC using 'planetarium Gold' software
 unka maananaa tha ki is tithi ko grahon kii vahi sthiti thi jiskaa varnan valmikiy ramayana main he
 But this time has become very suspicious
 'ai-sarv' ke shodh dal ne jis 'planetarium gold' software kaa prayog kiya vah vastav main isa purv 3000 se pehle kaa sahi grah-ganit karne main sakasham nahin he
 In fact, before 2013, there was no available software capable of doing so much earlier planetary mathematics
 is gananaa dwaara praapt grah-sthiti main shani vrishchik main tha arthath ucch main nahin tha
 The moon was not in Punarvasu Nakshatra but was in the second phase of Pushya and the date was also Ashtami
 baad main anya visheshgy dwaara ejplde431 software dwaara kii gayi sahi gananaa main tithi to navami ho jaati he parantu shani vrishchik main hi aata he tathaa chandramaa pushya ke chaturth charan main
 Therefore, the date of 10 January 5114 BCE is virtually not proved to be the birth date of Shri Ram
 aisi sthiti main ab yadi dow0 pi0 ve0 vartak dwaara pehle hi parishodhit tithi software dwaara pramanit ho jaae tabhi shriram kaa vaastavik samay praayah sarvamaanya ho paaegaa athwa pramanit na ho paane kii sthiti main naveen tithi ke shodh kaa rasta khulegaa
 There is clear evidence about the birth of Shri Ram in the Puranas that Shri Ram was born in a city called Ayodhya in Faizabad district of present-day Uttar Pradesh
 ayodhya jo ki bhagwaan ram ke purvajon kii hi rajdhani thi
 Raghu was the ancestor of Ramchandra ji
 ram bachapan se hi shant swabhaav ke vir purush the
 He always gave dignity the highest position

 His kingdom was considered fair and prosperous
 isliye bharat main jab bhi suraaj kii baat hoti he to ramraj yaa raamarajy kaa udhaaharan diya jaataa he
 Rama, who followed the path of religion, received education from Guru Vasistha along with his three brothers
 kishoravastha main guru vishwamitra unhen van main rakshason dwaara machaae ja rahe utpaat ko samaapt karne ke liye saath le gayi
 Rama was accompanied by his younger brother Lakshmana in this task
 tadka naamak rakshasi baxur main rahati thi
 He was killed there
 ram ne us samay tadka naamak rakshasi ko maaraa tathaa marich ko palaayan ke liye majaboor kiya
 During this time, Guru Vishwamitra took him to Mithila
 vahaan ke videh raja janak ne apni putree sita ke vivaah ke liye ek swayamvar samaaroh yojit kiya tha
 Where Lord Shiva had a bow whose Sita was to be married to the knight who donated the emblem
 bahut saare raja maharaja us samaaroh main padhaare the
 When many kings tried to put a bow on the bow even after trying, they could not even lift it, then Rama tried to offer the bow by raising Vishwamitra's command
 unki pratyancha chadhaane ke praytn main vah mahaan dhanush ghor dhwani karte hue tut gaya
 When Maharishi Parashurama heard this loud sound, he came there and started expressing anger at his Guru's bow breaking
 lakshmana ugr swabhaav ke the
 He had a dispute with Parashurama
 tab ram ne bich-bachaav kiya
 Thus Sita was married to Rama and was blessed by all people including Parashurama

 People wanted Rama very much

 Kaikeyi's maid Manthara misleads Kaikeyi that the king is doing wrong with you
 tum raja kii priy rani ho to tumhaari santan ko raja bananaa chahie par raja dasharath ram ko raja bananaa chaahate hai
 a detailed account of Rama's childhood is found in the Balakanda of Swami Tulsidas's Ramcharitmanas
 raja dasharath ke teen raniyaan thim: kaushalya, sumitra or kaikeyi
 Ram was the son of Kaushalya, Sumitra had two sons, Lakshmana and Shatrughna and Kaikeyi's son Bharata
 rajya niyamo se raja kaa jyeshtha ladkaa hi raja banane kaa paatr hota he at: ram ko ayodhya kaa raja bananaa nishchit tha
 Kaikeyi who twice saved Dasharatha's life and Dasaratha gave her the boon that she could ask for two brides at any moment of her life
 ram ko raja banate hue or bhavishya ko dekhte hue kaikeyi chaahati thi uskaa putr bharat hi raja bane, isliye unhone raja dasharath dwaara ram ko 14 varsh kaa vanvaas dilaayaa or apane putr bharat ke liye ayodhya kaa rajya maang liya
 In the verses, the king Dasaratha was forced to accept this
 ram ne apane pita kii ajna kaa paalan kiya

 That deer was Ravana's maternal uncle Marich
 usne ravan ke kehane par sunahare hiran kaa rup banaaya
 Sita was fascinated to see him and requested Shriram to hunt the deer
 shriram apni bharya kii ichha puri karne chal pade or lakshmana se sita kii raksha karne ko kaha| marich shriram ko bahut dur le gaya
 On getting the opportunity, Shriram shot an arrow and killed the deer Marich

 bahya jagat vichaar par nirbhar nahin he, yah swatantra he
 For 'self-realization', it is equally necessary to get knowledge of all the small and big, elemental and frivolous objects of the world
 in tatwon ke gyaan ke liye pramaanon kii apeksha hoti he
 In jurisprudence, special consideration has been given to proof, but in Vaishika philosophy mainly the idea of 'theorem' has been emphasized
 yahan samaran karana aavashyak he ki nyaay kii tarah vaisheshik bhi, loukik drushti hi se vishwa ke 'vaastavik' tatwon par darshanik vichaar karata he
 He never ignores the real conditions of the cosmic world, however, where the idea of an element cannot be without a subtle vision, there is some way to establish his theory based on senses, imperishable, subtle, yogic etc
 Has a nature, otherwise their ideological reefs would have been contradictory; As a result, acceptance of the elements like atom, sky, time, space, soul, mind, etc
 is equally present in this philosophy
 vaisheshikon ke swaroop, vesh tathaa aachaar aadi 'naiyayikon' kii tarah hote hai; jaise, ye log shaiva hai, inhen shaiva-diksha di jaati thi
 There are four major differences - Shaiv, Pashupat, Mahavratadhar, and minor differences like Kalmukh and Bharata, Bhaktar, etc
 are also found
 vaisheshik vishesh rup se "pashupat" kahe jate hai
 
 vaisheshik mat main samast vishwa "bhav or abhaav" in do vibhaagon main vibhajit he
 There are six divisions of "bhava" - whose names are matter, quality, action, general, special, and collective
 abhaav ke bhi chaar up-bhed hai - pragabhav, pradhvansabhaav, atyantabhaav tathaa anyonyabhaav
 In the texts, their characteristics etc
 are obtained like this: dravyajisamen "dravyatv jati" ho vahi dravya he
 Equalization of work is called Dravya
 dravya gunon kaa aashray he
 Earth, water, tejas, air, sky, kaal, dikha, soul and mind are called nine "matter"
 inamen se pratham chaar dravyon ke nity or anitya, do bhed hai
 The regular form is called the "atom" and the infinite form is the work
 chaaron bhuton ke us hisse ko "parmaanu" kehete hai jiskaa pun: bhaag na kiya ja sake, atev yah nity he
 Apart from Prithvi Pramanu, the properties of other atoms are also constant
 jisase gandh ho vah "prithvi", jisamen sheet sparsh ho vah "jal" jisamen ushn sparsh ho vah "tejas", jinamein rup na ho tathaa agni ke sanyog se utpann na hone vaala, anushna or asheet sparsh ho, vah "vaayu", tathaa shabd jiskaa gun ho arthath shabd kaa jo samavayikaran ho, vah "akaash" he
 These are also called 'panchabhut'
 akaash, kaal, dik tathaa aatma ye chaar "vibhu" dravya hai
 Man is non-material atom and also continual
 aaj, kal, is samay, us samay, maas, varsh, aadi samay ke vyavhaar kaa jo saadhaaran kaaran he- vah kaal he
 The period is constant and extensive
 purv, pashchim, uttar, dakshin, aadi dishaao tathaa vidishaao kaa jo asaadhaaran kaaran he, vah "dik" he
 It is also regular and comprehensive
 aatma or manas kaa swaroop yahan nyaayamat ke samaan hi he
 Asymmetry of virtue is "virtue"
 rup, ras, gandh, sparsh, sankhya, pariman, pruthaktv, sanyog, vibhaag, paratv, apratv, gurutv, dravatv, sneh, shabd, gyaan, sukh, du:kha, ichha, dwesh, praytn, dharm adharm tathaa sanskaar ye choubees gun ke bhed hai
 Of these, from form, smell, juice, touch, affection, natural fluidity, words and knowledge to the sacrament, these are the "peculiar qualities", the residual ordinary qualities
 gun dravya hi main rahete hai
 The function is called "karma"
 upar phenkna, neeche phenkna, sikudna, failaana tathaa gaman, jaise bhraman, spandan, rechan, aadi, ye paanch "karm" ke bhed hai
 Karma remains in matter only
 saamannek vastuon main jo ek si buddhi hoti he, uske kaaran prayek ghat main jo "yah ghat he" is prakaar kii e si buddhi hoti he, uskaa kaaran usamen rahanevaala "saamaanya" he, jise vastu ke naam ke aage "tv" lagaakar kaha jaataa he, jaise - ghatatv, patatv
 "tv" means knowledge of all persons under that caste
 yah nity he or dravya, gun tathaa karm main rahata he
 The more accommodating is called "normal", "normal" or "normal" or "power over"
 sattasamanya dravya, gun tathaa karm in teenon main rahata he
 What is common in every object and teacher is called "upper normal" or "normal special"
 ek vastu ko duusari vastu se pruthak karnaa saamaanya kaa arth he
 One who lives in the last department of specialties and one who lives in routine is called "special"
 nity dravyon main paraspar bhed karanevaala ekmaatr yahi padaarth he
 It is infinite
 samavyek prakaar kaa sambandh he, jo avyav or avyavi, gun or guni, kriya or kriyavan jati or vyakti tathaa vishesh or nity dravya ke bich rata he
 He is one and also continual
 kisi vastu kaa na hona, us vastu kaa "abhaav" kaha jaataa he
 There are four distinctions - "prague lack" is the first reason for the work to arise, the absence of that work, the absence of that work when the "absence lack" work, "extreme lack" in all the three periods which are completely lacking, such as Vandhya's son and "non-interdependence" are mutual absence, such as lack of septum in ghat and non-depletion of pat
 ye sabhi padaarth nyaayadarshan ke pramayon ke antargat he
 Therefore, they do not have a separate view in the judiciary, but they are mainly considered in Vaiseshika philosophy
 vaisheshik mat ke anusaar in saaton padaarthon kaa vaastavik gyaan praapt karne se mukti milti he
 Even though there is so much difference in the nature of substances between these two similar elements, both philosophies remain in the same, it is because the main theorem of both scriptures is "soul"
 aatma kaa swaroop donon darshanon main ek hi sa he
 The other subject is - the remedy to know the same soul
 usamen in donon darshanon main vishesh antar bhi nahin he
 There is a difference between words only and sometimes in process
 fal main bhed nahin he
 Therefore, according to the Judgment, from the philosophy of sixteen substances like proof, theorem, etc
 one gets the same kind of "liberation" from both
 donon kaa drushtikon bhi ek hi he
 In the Nyaya Vesika doctrine, earth, water, light and air also exist in the form of these four substances
 in laagon kaa mat main sabhi kaary dravyon kaa naash ho jaataa he or ve parmaanu rup main akaash main rahete hai
 This state is called "holocaust"
 is avasthaa main prayek jeevatma apane manas ke saath tathaa purv janmon ke karmon ke sanskaron ke saath tathaa adrusht rup main dharm or adharm ke saath vidyaman rahati he
 But at this time there is no work of creation
 kaaran rup main sabhi vastuen us samay kii pratiksha main rahati hai, jab jeevon ke sabhi adrusht kaary rup main parinat hone ke liye tatpar ho jate hai
 But there is an unseen root, even if the body is not there, the individual soul cannot do any work, atoms etc
 are all roots, then how should the action for "creation" arise? iske uttar main yah jaananaa chahie ki utpann honevaale jeevon ke kalyaan ke liye paramatma main sristi karne kii ichha utpann ho jaati he, jisase jeevon ke adrusht karyonmukh ho jate hai
 a type of action occurs in atoms, whereby one atom is combined with another atom
 do parmaanuon ke sanyog se ek "dravyanuk" utpann hota he
 The two atoms that are assembled to generate the earthly body are earthly atoms
 ve donon utpann hue "davyanuk" ke samavayikaaran hai
 The combination of both of them is asymmetric and unfriendly, God's will, etc
 isi prakaar jaleey, taijas aadi sharir ke sambandh main samajhnaa chahie
 It should be remembered that both homogeneous atoms are not created by mere creation
 unke saath ek vijaateey parmaanu, jaise jaleey parmaanu bhi rahata he
 The "mass" has a molecule, so it is not visible
 "davayanuk" se jo kaary utpann hoga vah bhi anupariman kaa hi rahegaa or vah bhi drushtigochar na hoga
 Therefore, the help of "three numbers" is taken to generate gross working matter from the atmosphere
 nyaay-vaisheshik main sthool dravya, sthool dravya kaa mahat parimanwale dravya se tathaa teen sankhya se utpann hota he
 Therefore, three numbers of the davyanukas generate the gross matter "trianuk" or "trishrenu"
 chaar tryanuk se chaturanuk utpann hota he
 In this sequence, earth and earthly substances are generated
 dravya ke utpann hone ke pashchaat usamen gunon kii bhi utpatti hoti he
 This is the process of creation
 sansar main jitani vastuen utpann hoti hai sabhi utpann hue jeevon ke bhoga ke liye hi hai
 The organism arises in the world due to the effects of deeds of its former birth
 usee prakaar bhoga ke anukool uske sharir, yoni, kul, desh, aadi sabhi hote hai
 When that special enjoyment ceases, then he dies
 isi prakaar apane apane bhoga ke samaapt hone par sabhi jeevon kii mrityu hoti he
 Nyayamat - There is also a sequence for "destruction"
 kaary dravya main, arthath ghat main, prahaar ke kaaran uske avyavon main ek kriya utpann hoti he
 By that action the department is in its components, the department eliminates the initiator combinations of the component
 or phir ghat nasht ho jaataa he
 In this sequence, all the work materials are destroyed at one time by the will of God
 isse spasht he ki asamavayikaaran ke naash se kaarydravya kaa naash hota he
 Sometimes the termination of the termination is also destroyed by the destruction of time
 inkaa dhyey he ki bina kaaran ke naash hue kaary kaa naash nahin ho saktaa
 Therefore, for the destruction of the universe, the action is produced in the atom itself and the atom is eternal, it is not destroyed, but the combination of two atoms is destroyed and then the "mass" form produced from it works and in the same order " "trinity" and "chatrunuk" and other works are also destroyed
 naiyayik log sthool drushti ke anusaar itnaa sookshm vichaar nahin karte
 In his opinion, once the gross matter is destroyed by mere shock
 kaary dravya ke naash hone par uske gun nasht ho jate hai
 There are also two previous opinions in this which have been represented in the "process of cooking"
 nyaay mat kii tarah vaisheshik mat main bhi buddhi, uplabdhi, gyaan tathaa pratyay ye samaan arth ke bodhak shabd hai
 In other philosophies, all these words are used in different terminological meanings
 buddhi ke anek bhed hone par bhi pradhan rup se iske do bhed hai - "vidya" or "avidya", avidya ke chaar bhed he - sanshay, viparyay, anadhyavsaay tathaa swapn
 Doubts and reversals have been represented in justice
 vaisheshik mat main inke arth main koi antar nahin he
 Indeterminate knowledge is called "non-occupation"
 jaise - katahal ko dekhakar vahik ko, ek sasna aadi se yukt gaay ko dekhakar narikel dweepavasiyon ke man main shankaa hoti he ki yah kya he? All the parts of the body get tired by working throughout the day
 unako vishram kii apeksha hoti he
 The senses are especially tired and absorbed in the mind
 phir man manowh naadee ke dwaara puritat naadee main vishram ke liye chalaa jaataa he
 Before reaching there, due to the rites of pre-work and the dissatisfaction of vat, pitta and kapha, the support of the unseen is revealed to the mind at that time by a variety of subjects, which is called dream knowledge
 yahan itnaa dhyaan main rakhana chahie ki vaisheshik mat main gyaan ke antargat ho "avidya" ko rakhaa he or isiilie "avidya" ko "mithyaa gyaan" bhi kehete hai
 Many say that these two words are against each other
 jo mithyaa hai, vah gyaan nahin kaha ja saktaa or jo gyaan he, vah kadaapi mithyaa nahin kaha ja saktaa
 There are also four types of learning - direct, inference, memory and joy
 yahan yah dhyaan main rakhana he ki nyaay main "smriti" ko yatharthagyan nahin kaha he
 That is the knowledge of the known
 isi prakaar "aarsh gyaan" bhi naiyayik nahin maanate
 The words or arrivals of the Nāyayikas have been inferred by the Vaishyāsikas in the estimation and the Upaman in direct
 veda ke rachnewale rishiyon ko bhoot tathaa bhavishya kaa gyaan pratyaksh ke samaan hota he
 It does not require approximation of sense and meaning
 yah "pratibh" gyaan yaa "arshgyaan" kehalaata he
 This knowledge also sometimes occurs in a pure living being
 jaise - ek pavitra kanya kahati he - kal mere bhai aavenge or sachmuch kal uske bhai aa hi jate hai
 This is "primordial knowledge"
 pratyaksh or anumaan ke vichaar main donon darshanon main koi bhi matbhed nahin he
 Therefore, they were not considered again here
 karm kaa bahut vistrut vivechan vaisheshik darshan main kiya gaya he
 These people also accept the five distinctions of "karma" as stated in the Nyaya Darshan in the same sense
 kayik cheshtaaon hi ko vastut: in logon ne "karm" kaha he
 Yet all efforts are made with the same effort
 atev vaisheshik darshan main ukt paanch bhedon ke prayek ke saakshaat tathaa parampara main praytn ke sambandh se koi karm prayatnpurvak hote hai, jinhen "satpratyay-karm" kehete hai, koi bina praytn ke hote hai, jinhen "asatpratyay-karm" kehete hai
 Apart from these, there are some such deeds, such as those in the earth, which are without any effort, are called "untimely deeds"
 in sab baton ko dekhakar yah spasht he ki vaisheshik mat main tatwon kaa bahut sookshm vichaar he
 Nevertheless, in the opinion of justice in worldly matters, Vaiseshika is very much agreed
 atev ye donon "samantantr" kahe jate hai
 In these two philosophies, there is a mention of some distinctions in which there is a "distinction"
 is prakaar ke donon shaastra katipay siddhanton main bhinn-bhinn mat rakhte hue bhi paraspar sambhddha hai
 Their other principles are mutually applicable
 shivadhanush shankar ji kaa priy dhanush tha jiskaa naam pinaak tha
 Shiva was placed as an inheritance to the King Janaka
 yah vahi dhanush he jo sita swayamvar main raja janak dwaara rakhaa gaya tha
 Lord Shri Ram broke this and married Sita
 anda gol yaa andakar jivit vastu he jo bahut se praaniyon ke maadaa dwaara paidaa kii jaati he
 Most animal eggs have a hard cover that protects the eggs
 yadhyapi anda jeevadhariyon dwaara apni santane paidaa karne kaa maarg he, kintu anda khaane ke kaam bhi aata he
 Protein and choline are rich in it in terms of nutrients
 prayek jati kii chidiyon ke andon main, thodi bahut bhinnata bhale hi ho, par inaki apni ek visheshta hoti he
 The size, shape and color of the eggs of birds of each race is unique
 pakshiyon ke jivan or unke angon ke aakaar, maap, sataha kii rachana or rang main ek sambandh he
 Similarly, there is a relation between the number of eggs within a bulk or group and the number of clots in a season
 andey kii maap mukhyat: anda denevaali chidiya ke dealdol par nirbhar karti he, kintu yah aavashyak nahin he ki anupaat hameshaa ek ho
 There are two reasons for this : murgi ke andey kaa jo aakaar hota he, vahi aakaar praaia: anya chidiyon ke andon kaa hota he
 The egg is long in one direction and has one end rounded and the other end slightly pointed
 andey ek chor par gol or duusare chor par nukile hone se saralata se ludhak nahin pate
 Also, with the pointed portion of the eggs being centered in the middle of the nest and their spherical portion facing out, if the nest contains three to four eggs, they all easily hatch
 kuch chidiyon ke andey lagbhag golakaar hote hai
 Owl eggs are spherical and bacassi eggs are thin and round at both ends
 kuch chidiyon ke andon kii satahen chikani hoti hai, kuch kii chamakili, kuch kii bahut adhik paalishdaar or kuch kii khurdari tathaa khadianuma hoti he
 The color of eggs also varies in different sparrows
 kuch chidiyon ke andey bilkul safed hote hai, kintu kuch ke andey rangeen, hare, nile, bhure or lalachaunh hote hai
 Some have the same color of eggs and some have pinto or speckled
 chitiyaan dhabbe ke rup main, athwa chaktton ke rup main hoti he or thodi athwa atyadhik sankhya main hoti hai
 The spots may be evenly scattered on the surface of the eggs, or more in one part and less in another
 kuch jati ke pakshiyon main ek hi jati ke antargat vibhinn sadasyon ke andon ke rang or chihnon main vyaktigat bhinnata hoti he
 Egg color is predominantly defensive
 atev hari daaliyon par die janevaale andon kaa rang haraa or jameen par die janevaale andon kaa rang praaia: bhura hota he
 Cotter or burrow eggs are often white, so that birds can detect them even in the dark
 gilmaat or regerbil keval ek hi anda detii hai, paravat yaa junglee kabutar or garud do, dhomara yaa gangachilli kii vibhinn jatiyaan teen or tittibh kii anek jatiyaan chaar andey detii hai
 Many species lay up to five to six eggs
 kuch gaanevaali choti kism kii chidiyon main saat aath se lekar das baarah tak andey milte hai
 Some hunting birds and ducks have even higher numbers
 adhikansh chidiyaan, yadi unke andey chura liye jaaain, athwa nasht ho jaaain, athwa andon ko tyaagane ke liye ve baadhya kar di jaayen, to phir se andey detii hai, kyonki har pakshi ke andon kii ek nishchit sankhya hoti he
 Until this number is reached, it does not stop laying eggs
 chidiyaan saadharantaya ek ritu main ek hi baar ade detii hai
 Some singing birds produce children two or three times during the season
 jin chidiyon ke andey or bachche adhik nasht hote hai, athwa jo alpaayu hoti hai, unamem janan teevr gati se or andon kii sankhya adhik hoti he
 The age of sparrows also affects their number of eggs
 pratham baar maan bananevaali chidiyaan kam or duusari yaa teesri baar andey denevaali chidiyaan adhik andey detii hai
 When the number of eggs is complete, their army begins
 pakshi badi lagan or tatparta se andey sete hai, apane pankhons se unhen garam rakhte tathaa unki raksha karte hai : In most castes, both males and females perform the function of ovulation, even though the hatching works slightly more then the other
 kabhi kabhi din main maadaa andey seti he or raatri main nar
 In some castes, only females lay eggs, but in such a state the male raises food for it
 kisi kisi jati main nar or maadaa baari baari sein aate jate rahete hai
 During the egg-intake period, the female gets attention in hatching and such a concentration is created that if someone removes her eggs and keeps any other thing, like stone pieces, ballasts, etc
, then she will be without See, they will sit and sit on them
 bahudhaa aisa dekha gaya he ki andon ke kharaab yaa nirjeev ho jane par bhi maadaa ek lambii avadhi tak unhen seti rahati he
 In pigeons, the male incubates the egg with great fervor
 yahi nahin, balki maadaa ko hataakar swayan andon par baithta he
 The male cannot give himself, but in the desire of childbirth, he somehow binds the female and binds her, fetches the eggs from the female and then performs all the activities of her hatching and grooming herself with great enthusiasm
 lapland or ouk jati ke pakshiyon main nar kii sankhya adhik he, maadaa kii kam
 Thus, not all male pairs are successful in tying, but their desire for hatching and rearing of children does not go through their heart
 isse thik vipareet kuch pakshi aise bhi hai, jo andon ko swayan na sekar dusron se sevate hai
 Cuckoo, papiha etc
 are the main among them, who steal their eggs in the nests of crows, sparrows or satbhaiya etc
 and fool them and take care of them as midwives
 kuch aise pakshi hai, jo andon ko na to swayan sete hai or na auron se sevate hai, balki unhen dhoop ke taap se pakaakar unki raksha karte hai
 a bird named Ostrich prepares the pit with the rubbing of its chest and erects a wall by placing sand with a beak around it
 phir isi main maadaaen, praaia: 20 se 30 tak, andey dete hai
 Ostrich does not have a single female, a male has many wives and all of them pass eggs in turn
 andey dene kaa kaam puraa ho jane par, inpar ek halki si baaluu kii parat bicha di jaati he
 These eggs are warmed by the rays of the sun throughout the day
 ratrikaal main ye pakshi inpar baithper inhen ushnata pradaan karte hai
 There are many birds, which are built near a hot spring and lay eggs in them, then cover them and go elsewhere
 jharne ke ushn jal se ye andey garam rahete hai
 At the end of the time, they come back and remove the top soil, then the children come out after breaking the eggs
 jahaan atyadhik garmi padati hai, vahaan ke pakshi andon ko thandha rakhane kii vyavastha karte hai, garam rakhane kii nahin
 For this, they soak their beaks in water and soak eggs in them, so that they do not get damaged due to excessive heat
 sevankaal bhi, chidiyon main vibhinn hota he
 In larger sparrows or in sparrows whose children develop well, the intake period is longer
 kisi kisi main sevankaal ek maheene kaa or kisi kisi main do saptaah se bhi kam kaa hota he
 Months are spent incubating eggs on a bird
 murgi ko anda sene main teen saptaah lagate hai, teetar ko chaar, hans ko paanch tathaa cander naamak pakshi ko puure do maheene
 Birds' eggs are laid outside and embryonic development takes place inside the eggs
 bhrun ke purna viksit ho jane par vihang shishu andey rupi kaidakhane se baahar aane ke liye apni chonch se baar baar prahaar karata he or andey ke bichon bich, athwa anya kisi chaude sthal par jatibhed ke anusaar, ek daraar ho jaati he or shishu baahar nikal aata he
 At that time he remains soaked with a fluid, which dries up quickly due to wind
 murgi, teetar, shuturamurg aadi ke bachche to nikalate hi daudna shuru kar dete hai, par tote, phakhte or coy aadi ke shishu kai dinon tak aankh nahin khol pate,
 They remain in a state of immortality and spend their infancy days in weeks in Dhansale
 andey se baahar aane par shishu chidiya ke pratham kuch saptaah kuch vishesh kathinaaiyon evam khataron ke hote hai
 These days she is not only small and weak, but often unable to swallow food herself and is also helpless by flying
 bhinn jati ke pakshiyon ke shishu bhinn avasthaa main utpann hote hai or is aadhaar par unka vargeekaran nimnlikhit do pramukh shreniyon main kiya ja saktaa he : The eyes of a dormant baby are open from birth and their body is covered with soft feathers
 ye aarambh se hi satark tathaa chanchal hote hai or daud yaa tair sakate hai
 Yes, if they are not teased, then after birth they would like to remain silent for a few hours
 ye prarambh se hi apana dana swayan chugana shuru kar dete hai
 Ducks and chickens are good examples of this
 junglee chidiyon main tittibh, jalkukkuti, batakh or shikaar kii anya chidiyon ke shishu bhi aisa hi karte hai
 Another feature of hunting birds is that they also start flying soon
 needvasi shishu janm ke pashchaat bade hone tak ghonsle main hi pade rahete hai or inhen aahaar ke liye apane maan baap par hi purnat: nirbhar rahanaa padataa hai
 They are blind and helpless at birth and more or less bare in most cases; That is, they are non-smoking and unattractive
 bataakhi, kilkila ; or harith kashthakut ke shishu bilkul nange utpann hote hai
 Cormorant and Buck are a group of birds whose children are completely naked at birth, that is, they live on very little on their body
 pakshi jis tatparta ke saath andey sete hai, usee tatparta se apni santan kaa paalan poshan evam rakshan bhi karte hai
 In child protection it is often seen that birds do not even worry about their lives
 santanraksha main tarah-tarah kii bahanebaajiyaan karke ye pakshi aagatuk ko achambhe main bhi daale dete hai
 Often they start to see it and hang it as if they were injured by a hunter
 dushman shikari, badhik, shwaan, shrugaladi inhen pakadaney kii aashaa lekar jab inkaa peechha karte hai, to ye dur tak chakma dete hue nikal jate hai or tab ekaek teji se udakar kahin chal dete hai
 In this way, taking the enemy away from the nest and astray him, so that he can move in some other direction and avoid the calamity on the babies of the needles
 chidiyaan dusron kii aankh main dhul jhonknaa bhi khub jaanati hai
 When they are sometimes surrounded, they lie dead and lie on the ground, which the viewer considers them dead and moves forward
 phir ye sheeghra jameen chhodkar aage bhaag khadi hoti he
 Sometimes even if caught, they pretend to be dead, so that we can leave them as dead
 bharat main shaharikaran swatantrata ke baad hone vaali vah ghatana he jisamen bharat main nagaron ki sankhya or aakaar main tezi se badhottaree hui he or saath hi kul jansankhya main shahari jansankhya kaa pratishat bhi badha he
