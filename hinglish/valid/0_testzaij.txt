 17 farvari 2009 ko, GSM association ne ghoshnaa kari ki ve mobile phone ke liye ek maanak charger par sahamat hue hai
 The standard charger adopted by the 17 manufacturers, including Nokia, Samsung and Motorola, should be the micro USB connector

 Mobile phone manufacturers, including solar cells, are experimenting on alternative sources of energy
 bydaree ke alaava, GSM mobile phone ko kaam karne ke liye ek choti si microchip kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jise graahak pahchaan maapdand yaa sim card kaha jaataa he
 The SIM card of approximately a postage stamp size is usually placed at the back of the unit under the battery and stores the configuration data and information about the phone, such as which call scheme the user is using
 jab graahak sim card ko hataa detaa he, to ise pun: duusare phone main daal kar saamaanya rup se upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Each SIM card is activated by the use of a unique numeric identifier; Once activated, the identifier is localized and the card is permanently clad in the active network
 is kaaran se, adhikansh khudara vikreta ek sakriy kiye gaye sim card ko vaapis lene se inkaar kar dete hai
 Cell phones that do not use a SIM card have data programmed into their memory
 ek vishesh aankik kram kaa upyog karke is data kaa upyog kiya jaataa he he, "NAM" ko "naam" yaa number kramadesh suchi ke rup main upyog karne ke liye
 From here, one can get any information such as a number for your phone, new service provider number, new emergency number, change of their authentication key or A-key code and list or perl to rotate their favorites
 However, to prevent someone from accidentally deactivating their phone or deleting it from the network, service providers use a master assistant shut down or MSL on this data
 MSL yah sunishchit karata he ki seva pradaata khride gaye yaa patte par liye gaye phone ke liye bhugtan praapt karen
 For example, the Motorola RAZR V9C costs more than CAD $ 500
 lagbhag $200 main, vaahak ke aadhaar par, aapako ek mil sakati he
 The difference is paid by the customer as a monthly bill
 yadi graahak ne ek MSL kaa upyog nahin kiya, to ve $300 - $400 kaa antar kho denge jo unke masik bill main bhugtan kiya jaataa he, kyunki kuch graahak maujuuda seva ko radd karke duusare vaahak ke paas phone le jate hai
 The MSL applies to the SIM only because once the contract is completed, the MSL still applies to the SIM
 phone haalanki, shuru main bhi seva pradaata MSL main nirmaataa dwaara band kiya jaataa he
 This lock can be disabled so that this phone can use another service provider's SIM card
 america ke baahar kharide gaye phone khule phone hai kyonki vahaan zyaadaatar phone ek duusare ke nikatataa main kai seva pradaata yaa ativyapee vyapti he
 The cost of unlocking a phone varies but is usually very inexpensive and sometimes provided by independent phone vendors
 saamaanya vyapti kshetra ke baahar MSL seva pradaata ke upyog main ucch laagat kii vajah se ek khulaa phone yatriyon ke liye behad upyogi hota he
 This can sometimes be 10 times the price of using a closed phone as a foreigner in the general service area, even with discounted rates

 udhaaharan ke liye, jamaika main, ek AT&T graahak bhunaai antarrashtriya seva ke liye $1
65 prati minute kaa atirikt bhugtan kar saktaa he jabaki ek B-mobile graahak ko samaan antarrashtriya seva ke liye $0
20 prati minute kaa bhugtan karnaa padegaa
kuch seva pradaata apane bikri ko antarrashtriya bikri par kendrit karte hai jabaki kuch kshetreey bikri par kendrit karte hai
 For example, the same b-mobile customer will pay less on local calls but more on international calls than in Jamaica's national phone C&W company
 yah mulya antar mukhyatah mudra parivartan ke kaaran hota he kyonki sim kii kharid sthaneey mudra main hoti he

 World peace is an idea of establishing non-violence across the earth, under which countries cooperate either voluntarily or through a system of governance, so as to prevent war
 However, the term is sometimes used to refer to the elimination of all forms of enmity between all individuals for world peace
 sambhaavnajbaki vishwa shanti saidhantik rup se sambhav he, kuch kaa maananaa he ki maanav prakruti swaabhaavik taur par ise rokatii he

 Capitalist peace theory In its book "capitalism Peace Theory" Ion Rand admits that the great wars of history were fought against free by countries with relatively more controlled economies of that time and that capitalism provided mankind with the longest peace in history And the period in which the entire civilized world participated, from the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 to the First World War in 1914 Idne should be taken to not miss Track war political systems of the nineteenth century were not pure capitalism, but mixed economies
 haalanki poonjeevaad ke tatv kaa prabhutv tha, par yah poonjeevaad kii ek sadi ke utane hi kareeb tha, jitna maanav jati ke aane tak tha
 But elements of statehood continued to flourish throughout the nineteenth century and the governments involved dominated the policies of statehood until the time of its eruption in 1914
 However, this doctrine led to countries outside Europe, as well as to integration
 The brutal colonial wars waged by Western countries against the wars in Germany and Italy, the franco-persian War and other conflicts in Europe Ignored
 It presents the absence of war as a scale of peace, when class struggle actually existed ahimsa kaa saamaanya arth he 'hinsa na karnaa'
 Its broad meaning is - do not harm any creature with body, mind, deeds, words and speech
 man me kisi kaa ahit na sochna, kisi ko katuvaani aadi ke dwaar bhi nuksaan na dena tathaa karm se bhi kisi bhi avasthaa main, kisi bhi praani ki hinsa na karnaa, yah ahimsa he| hindu dharm main ahimsa kaa bahut mahatva he
 Ahimsa Paramo Dharma: Religion is stated
 aadhunik kaal main mahatma gandhi ne bharat kii aazaadee ke liye jo aandolan chalaaya vah kaaphi seemaa tak ahimsaatmak tha
 i am not a dreamer main swayan ko ek vyaavhaarik adarshavaadi maanata hum
 The religion of non-violence is not only for sages and saints
 yah saamaanya logon ke liye bhi he
 Ahimsa is the law of humans in the same way that violence is the law of animals
 pashu kii aatma suptavastha main hoti he or vah keval shaareerik shakti ke niyam ko hi jaanata he
 a higher law of human dignity requires the force of the soul to follow the law

 He was also a great warrior from Wellington himself
 shastron ke prayog kaa gyaan hone par bhi unhone uski vyarthta ko pahachaanaa or shraant sansar ko bataaya ki uski mukti hinsa main nahin apitu ahimsa main he
 Hari Om Shastri, in the ordinary sense, non-violence refers to non-violence, but non-violence is a negative word
 use vilom shabd bhi kah sakate hai
 The real meaning of non-violence is to be fearless
 maanav kaa nidar hona uskaa sabase bada gun he
 It comes in a rhetoric of the Rigveda: Lord! You grant us Abhay
 nidar vyakti hi swatantra ho saktaa he
 He who is chained to his feet, how can he be independent and he who is not independent, he cannot be fearless
 paratantr or bhaybheet vyakti ahimsa kaa paalan nahin kar saktaa
 Ahimsa is the beauty of a brave man
 ahimsa kaayar purush se dur-dur bhaagti he
 Non-violence is unanimous even if there is a difference of opinion among the religions of the world
 isliye ahimsa ko bahut hi vichaar evam vivek se samaj lene kii aavashyaktaa he
 Lord Buddha was the first to proclaim non-violence in his sermons
 bhagwaan buddha ke upadeshon kaa asar yah hua ki us samay yagyon ke dauraan jo pashu hinsa hoti thi, vah samaapt ho gai
 But later on, due to not being able to understand the meaning of non-violence properly, the result was that there were many attacks on India and it became a slave
 bhagwaan buddha ke baad duusare the mahavir swami, jinka ahimsa ke mat par bahut prabhaav rahaa
 In Jainism tradition, wearing clothes on the body is also considered violence, but even after Mahavir Swami, the effect of non-violence could not be applied in its right form
 jain dharm main yama ke ye paanchon sutara aakraant ho gaye hai - ahimsa, satya, aste, brahmacharya or aparigrah
 The meaning of this statement can be understood by this incident
 ek baar bhagwaan buddha ne apane bhikshuon ko upadesh dete hue kaha ki bhiksha paatr main jo kuch praapt ho jaae, vahi grahan kar lenaa chahie
 Incidentally, one day Chil put a piece of meat in a monk's vessel
 is par bhikshu ne bhagwaan buddha se poocha, to bhagwaan buddha ne saamaanya bhav se kah diya ki ise grahan kar lijie
 But the result of this was that in the future people caught the sentence of Lord Buddha and started eating meat
 aaj china, mongolia, srilanka, java tathaa bharat ke kuch bhaagon main jahaan buddha dharm kaa prachaar-prasar he, log maansaahaar karte hai
 The same is the case with non-violence
 pashchimi jagat main karunaa or prem kaa sandesh dene vaale yishu ahimsa ke agradoot maane jate hai, parantu ahimsa ke siddhant kaa pratipaadan karne vaale bhagwaan yishu kaa parinaam atyant dukhad rahaa
 He was eventually hanged on the cross and his opponents called him a coward
 isse spasht parilakshith hota he ki bhagwaan yishu ke anuyaayiyon ne ahimsa ke mul arth ko thik prakaar se nahin samajha
 In Indian thought, we have to know the ideal meaning of non-violence
 mahabharat yuddh ke aarambh main bhagwaan shrikrishna arjuna ko yuddh hetu prerit karne ke liye upadesh dete hai
 In the sight of Lord Krishna, non-violence means that the man whose conscience does not have such a sense of 'I am the doer' and whose intellect does not indulge in worldly matter and deeds, the man does not actually kill and kill everyone
 Is neither bound by sin
 maanaskaar kehete hai ki aattaayiyon ko dand dene ke liye jinke haath main dhanush or baan hai, aise prabhu shri ram kii vandana karata hum
 God also considers it appropriate to kill Tadka to protect the yajna
 bhakton kii raksha ke liye meghnad ke yajna ke vidhwans kaa aadesh dete hai
 To establish the culture of yoga, it is also considered appropriate to kill the demons of millions
 yah he ahimsa kaa yatharth swaroop
 That is why Manskar wrote param dharam shruti vidit ahimsa
 But condemnation was not enough
 
 In the Vedas, non-violence is considered the ultimate religion and is not as heavy a sin as Paraninda

 But the then government led by Manmohan Singh showed negative attitude towards it and ignored it
 iske parinamswaroop shuru hue anshan ke prati bhi unka ravaiya upeksha purna hi rahaa
 But taking the form of the agitation for this fast, the Government of India hastily avoided the potential danger by forming a committee and accepted the passage of Lokpal Bill in Parliament by 16 August
 agast se shuru hue monsoon satr main sarkaar ne jo vidheyak prastut kiya vah kamjor or jan lokapal ke sarvatha vipareet tha
 Anna Hazare reiterated that he would go on hunger strike from August 16 against his earlier declared date
 sarkaar ne isaki raah main kai rode atkaaye evam 16 agast ko anna hajaare evam unke saathiyon ko giraftaar kar liya
 But this led to agitation in the entire country

 antat sarkari mantriyon ke ravaiye se niraash anna hajaare ke saathiyon ne jan lokapal kaa masauda alag se nirmit kiya
 And thus the committee produced two drafts which were placed before the Union Cabinet
 vahaan bhi mantriyon ke masaude ko to purnatah prastut kiya gaya kintu jan lokapal kaa saransh rakhaa gaya
 And as expected, the cabinet adopted the draft ministers and agreed to present it in Parliament

 He added further to Anna's talk that besides the mps, people should also go outside the houses of ministers and mlas in Delhi and picket and ask those people what their opinion is
 22 agast ko subah se shaam tak logon kaa saansadon or mantriyon ke gharon ke saamne jaakar pradarshan karne kaa silsilaa jari rahaa
 Police also detained 50 people after demonstrating in front of Union Minister Kapil Sibal's house
 is andolan ko aage badhaane or kharchon ke liye paisa jutaney ke liye ramlila maidan main banaae gaye daan shivi par bhi logon kii lambii qatari lagi rahi
 Be it children or elderly, rich or poor, everyone was donating to this movement according to his capacity
 log apane gharon se khaanaa banaakar yahaan anna ke samarthakon ko baant rahe the
 The rich businessman, who was distributing food and drink in a truck or a laborer who was busy in cleaning the Ramlila Maidan, all were coming here on a call of Anna to the country of their own free will
 anshan ke saatven din anna kaa vajan 5 kilo kam ho gaya
 Ketones started coming in his blood and urine
 lekin unka utsaah purvavat hi bana rahaa
 Concerned over the deterioration of his health and its political impact, the government appointed Pranab Mukherjee to hold talks
 pehle daur kii vaarta kaaphi sakaaratmak rahi
 Anna supporters differed on three issues and three terms were to be considered
 sarkari vaartakaron ne iske liye agle din subah tak kaa samay liya
 Dr
 Naresh Trehan had advised Anna Hazare to drip after checking the health of Anna Hazare on the evening of Tuesday 23 August but he also refused
 raat ko logon ko sambodhit karte hue anna ne kaha ki dopaher ke baad doctoron ne kaha tha ki kidney main kuch samasya aa gai he or unhen drip ke zarie dawa deni hogi
 i told the doctors that i would listen to my conscience and tell what i would do
 meri antaratma kah rahi he ki tu ye kya kah rahaa he ki dil diya he, jaan bhi denge or jaan dene se darataa he
 

 So i have told the doctors that my conscience is saying that no medicine is to be taken
 mai mar gaya to parvaah nahin, mere baad kitne anna khadey ho gaye hai
 If something happens to their kidneys, then one of the thousands of people will give them the kidney
 doctor kii report ke baad sarkaar bhi kuch sochane lagegi or agar sarkaar kii ore se unhen jabardastee uthaakar le jane ke prayaas honto saare darwaazon par log khadey ho jaaen or mujhe le jane na dena
 "the government's position changed overnight and on 24 August it withdrew from the consensus reached yesterday
 usne jan lokapal vidheyak ko sansad main prastut karne se inkaar kar diya or anna ke anshan ko unki samasya bataaya
 The possibility of forcibly lifting Anna from the hunger strike also increased
 24 agast buudhvaar kii shaam ko samarthakon ko sambodhit karte hue anna hazaare ne kaha- "do not commit violence 


 i will not tolerate violence
 agar main jail jaaun to aap log saansadon ke ghar par virodh jataao
 Do not do any harm to national property
 agar police aati he to main kushi se jail jaaoongaa
 or kal se sabko jail baro andolan karnaa he
 The country has to be saved from the path of non-violence
 ye azaadiki duusari ladaai he
 The government's attitude is not dictatorial, but dictatorship
 ye lokshahi ke liye bahut bada khatara he lekin meri vinati he ki agar sarkaar mujhe yahaan seuthae to use koi roke nahin
 Now i have understood the tricks of the government
 sarkaar chaahati he ki andolan ko todane ke liye aap log hinsa karen
 So we all have to be restrained
 "25 agast ko anshan ke 10wein din ramlila maidan main anna hajaare ne kaha ki "meraa vajan sirf 6
5 kilogram kam hua he
 The rest is fine
 mujhe aisa lag rahaa he ki main jan lokapal vidheyak paarit hone tak nahin maruunga
 i am getting a lot of energy from you
 " Demonstrations across the country continued for the tenth consecutive day in support of Anna Hazare
 lagaataar duusare din logon ne pradhanmantri awaas ke baahar pradarshan kiya
 50 of them were taken into custody
 ahimsaatmak pradarshnon se ghabaraai sarkaar kii suraksha ke naam par par dilli police ne pradhanmantri awaas ke najadik ke chaar metro steshnon- huda city centre or jahangirpuri ke bich sthit udyog bhawan, res course or jor baag tathaa kendriya sachivalay se badarpur maarg par khan market metro stesan ko dopaher teen baje se band karvaa diya
 In an interaction with Anna Hazare's representatives and the government, the Prime Minister said while trying to calm the deadlock that arose on August 24, the government is ready to discuss the bill and government bill of Aruna Rai including Jan Lokpal in the House
 bhrashtachar ke masale par loksabhaa main charchaa kii gai
 The Lok Sabha, including the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, unanimously appealed to Anna Hazare to end his fast
 iske baad kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogikimantri vilasarav deshmukh ne ramlila maidan jaakar anna hajaare ko sabhi partiyon tathaa sansad kii ore se bheja gaya patr diya or unase anshan samaapt karne kaa aagrah kiya
 On the proposal of getting the Jan Lokpal including Aruna Rai's Bill and the Government Bill discussed in the House, Anna said that "if the discussion on the Jan Lokpal Bill starts in Parliament, we will consider breaking our fast
" lekin hamaari teen mukhya maange hai
 Appointment of Lokayukta in states, bringing lower level officers also under the purview of Lokpal and make a citizen charter
 yah teenon garibon ke liye hai
 Their fast will continue until there is a consensus between the ruling party and the opposition on these issues
 pradhanmantri or puri sansad dwaara apane swasthya par chintaa jataae jane par apni pratikriya dete hue anna hajaare ne kaha ki "iske liye ham unhen dhanyavad dete hai
 But he was worried about my health today
 anna ke swasthya kii chintaa he unhen to vah 10 dinon se kahaan the
 Actually, the concern is those who have come here
 air condishan main baithne waalon ko anna ke swasthya kii chintaa nahin he
 "anna wrote to the Prime Minister in a letter to Vilasrao that-" We have great respect for our Parliament, our Parliament is the holy temple of our democracy
 " main anshan par apane kisi swaarth ke liye nahin baitha, jis tarah se aap log desh kii bhalaai ke liye kaam kar rahe hai usee tarah se main bhi desh ke logon ke bare main hi sochataa rahata hoon
 i have no power of any kind
 main ek bahut saamaanya aadmi hoon or samaaj va garib janata ke liye kuch karne kii bhaavana rakhata hoon
 Our movement is not against any person or party
 ham bhrashtachar ke kilaaf hai
 We want to change the corrupt system
 yadi hamaare andolan ke dauraan mere athwa mere kisi saathi ke dwaara kuch aise shabd kahe gaye kiye gaye hon jisase aapako yaa kisi anya vyakti ko chot pahaunchi ho to main ham sabaki taraf se dilgir vyakt karata hoon
 It is not our goal to hurt anyone
 har rajya main isi kaanoon ke zarie lokayukta bhi banaae jaaen, har vibhaag main jan samasyaon ke liye citizans charter banaae jaae jise na maanane par sambandhit adhikari par karrwai ho or teesraa ye ki centre sarkaar ke upar se neeche tak sabhi karmchaariyon or rajya ke sabhi karmchaariyon ko iske daayre main laayaa jaae
 Can a motion be brought to Parliament on these three things? i have no hope that all our mps will be ready at the beginning to rid the people of the country of corruption every day
 My conscience says that if these things are agreed in Parliament, then i should break my fast
 " The rest of the Jan Lokpal bill, such as the selection process, is also very important to prevent corruption
 main meri janata ke saath tab tak ramlila maidan main baitha rahoonga jab tak baaqi saare muddon par sansad main nirnay nahin ho jaataa kyonki yahi janata kii awaz he
 So many people have joined me all over the country in the hope that they will get rid of corruption
 iske liye jaruri he ki rajyon main bhi lokayukta ke gathan ke liye kanoon paas ho
 There should be a system to fight against the corruption of the officials, who have to face two-four daily corruption
 isi tarah sabhi sarkari sevaaon ke liye samaysima tay ho or unhen samay par puraa nahin karne vaale adhikari par jurmaana lage
 This letter of Anna was also discussed at the Anna Hazare Prime Minister's residence, but the attitude of the government remained the same the next day
 
 With this, the government had prepared a section of media through advertisements and other means which was now trying to justify their favor
 kai sanchaar madhyam anna team ke bich foot, pradarshkon ke bich lokapal kii kam samajhadaari aadi vishay uthaane lage the
 Despite this the movement was continuing and the government was under increasing pressure
 sansad kii kaarywai kaa sidhaa prasaaran dekhakar evam netaaon ke bayaan or chehre dekhakar janata anna ke saath rahane ke nirnay par atal thi
 On August 26, after remaining silent for 11 days, Rahul Gandhi, who is considered the future helper of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, said - "it is a dangerous practice to reduce the dignity of democracy
" vyaktigat rup se kai logon ne desh ko mahatvapurn yogadan diya he lekin ye samajhnaa zaruri he ki loktantric prakriya kaa apana mahatv he, loktantricprakriya lambii zarur hoti he par isse sabhi ko apana vichaar rakhane kaa mauka miltaa he
 

 In the past, it is being understood that the coming out of an ombudsman law will get rid of corruption, but it is wrong, just by enacting an ombudsman law will not end corruption, but it will have to find solutions to many more challenges
 Kiran Bedi wrote on Twitter that, "it may not be enough for an ombudsman to get started
" "rahul gandhi ke bayaan se acroshit anna hajaare ke samarthakon ne shuukravaar ko unke tughlaq road sthit awaas ke baahar pradarshnakia or jamkar narebaaji kii
 Police took 50 of Anna's supporters into custody
 rahul gandhi ne apane ghar ke baahar pradarshan kar rahe anna samarthakon ke liye cold drinks or samose bhijwaaye
 On 27 August, the government debated Anna's three main demands in Parliament
 
 By 8 o'clock in the night, both the houses of Parliament passed a resolution to send it to the Standing Committee to consider these conditions by voice
 sansad ke donon sadanon main shanivaar ko lokapal mudde par anna hajaare kii maangon ke anuroop laae gaye prastaav par saidhantik rup se sahmati banane ke baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa patr lekar kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogiki mantri vilasarav deshmukh, saansad sandip dikshit or purv kendriya mantri vilaas mutemvaar ne anna ko ramlila maidan pahunchakar diya
 After this, Anna Hazare addressed the supporters and said, "jan Lokpal has won this half
 puri jeet abhi baaki he
 This is the victory of the entire youth power
 yah janataki jeet he
 This is the victory of social organization
 yah media kii jeet he
 "I want to end my fast in the presence of you all at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, that too with your permission
 aap jashn jarur manaaen lekin dhyaan rakhen ki isse shanti bhang na ho or kisi ko pareshaani na ho
 Anna ended the fast on 28 August by drinking honey-mixed coconut water at the hands of Simran, a five-year-old girl from the Dalit community of Sundernagri, and Iqra, a Muslim from Turkman Gate
 anna ke anshan sthagit karne se pehle unke pramukh sahyogi arvind kejariwal ne apane lambey vaktavy main manch se logon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki wo sabhi raajnneetik dalon kaa dhanyavad karte hai or saath hi logon kaa bhi jinke sadakon par aane ke kaaran sarkaar par dabaav bana
 This proposal would not have passed without the cooperation of the parties
 We thank them
 


samvidhan logon ne banaaya he or sabase upar log hai jiske baad samvidhan, sansad or saansad aate hai
 The laws in Parliament were made according to the wishes of the people
 anna yaa anna kaa andolan samvidhan ke kilaaf nahin he jaisaa ki team ke bare main prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he
 After breaking the fast, Anna thanked the people of the country, especially the youth, media, police and doctors for their care in making the movement successful and said that "they have just postponed their fast but their fight will continue 
 asli anshan puri ladaai jeetne ke baad tuutegaa
 i will roam across the country till the fight is over
 unhen vishwaas he ki unke madhyam se saamne laae gaye janata ke muddon se sansad inkaaranheen karegi
 But if the parliament refused, then the mass parliament would have to be ready
 aaj yah baat sabit ho gai he ki jan sansad, dilli kii sansad se badi he
 Whatever the Parliament wants, the Parliament of Delhi has to accept it
 hamen baba sahib ambedkar ke banaae samvidhan ke tahat is desh main parivartan laana he
 Today it has been proved that change can be brought
 ham bhrashtachar mukt bharat kaa nirmaan kar sakate hai
 This is just the beginning
 lambi ladaai aage he
 It is the question of the farmers, the question of the workers
 paryaavaran, pani, tel jaise tamaam mudde hai
 It is a question of education of poor children
 hamen chunaav sudhaar bhi karne hai
 The entire system has to be changed
 hamaara asli anshan is puure badlaav ke baad hi tuutegaa
 Today such a big movement took place in the country, but completely non-violent
 duniya ke saamne aap sabhi ne misaal rakhi he ki andolan kaise karnaa chahie
 This has been the most important thing in this movement
 22 agast ko pradhanmantri ne vitt mantri pranav mukherjee, raksha mantri e
ke
 antni va grih mantri pi
 chidambaram se charchaa ke baad sarkaar ne pranav mukherjee ko vaartakar niyukt kiya or anna ko patr likhakar is sarkari pahal kii jaankaree di
 After this, Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid and Anna's aide Arvind Kejriwal and Akhil Gogoi met at the residence of Congress MP Sandeep Dixit
 iske baad arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar vaarta ke liye taiyaar ho gai he
 Pranab Mukherjee has been appointed for this
 23 agast kii raat ko pehle daur kii vaarta main sarkaar kii ore se mukherjee va salmaan khurshid ne bhaag liya
 Kiran Bedi, Arvind Kejriwal and Prashant Bhushan joined on behalf of civil society

 The government expressed concern over Anna's health and said that talks would be held again on Wednesday morning
 anna dal ke sadsy arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar or hamaare bich teen muddon par asahmati he
 The government has sought time till Wednesday morning to consider them
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar ne anna se anshan todane kii bhi apil kii he
 But in the conversation that took place today, nothing came out that we should ask Annaji to break the fast
 vaarta main sarkaar kuch muddon par sahamat ho gai thi
 But many subjects had not yet been agreed
 iske saath hi anna ke sahyogi kuch sharton par sarkaar kii manjuuri bhi chaahate the
 Keeping in mind the re-talks with Anna's colleagues in the morning, late night the Prime Minister called an emergency meeting on the Anna issue and discussed it with senior ministers
 iske turant baad congress kor group kii baithak bhi hui
 But the result of all these exercises came to the contrary on 24 August
 sarkaar kaa rukh bilkul badal gaya tha
 After a conversation with Pranab Mukherjee, Prashant Bhushan said that the government's stand was very positive in the talks held on Tuesday, but on Wednesday everything looked like a revenge
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar ne saafe kar diya he ki wo jan lokapal bill ko pesh nahin karegi
 Kiran Bedi said that Pranab Mukherjee appeared in a rage as soon as the meeting started on Wednesday and he was saying that you should keep doing it
 anna ke anshan ke bare main sarkaar ne kaha ki wo unki yani naagarik samaaj or anna hazaare kii samasya he
 i don't know why it changed in the government's attitude in one day and night
 mangalvaar ko wo hamaari baaten sun rahe the, aaj wo apni baaten suna rahe the
 Yesterday, he was respecting our words
 kal or aaj main din-raat kaa fark aayaa he
 " is gatirodh ke pashchaat 25 agast ko pradhanmantri ne vilasarav deshmukh ko patr dekar anna ke paas bheja
 Anna assured to quit the fast after three things were approved
 27 agast ko sansad kii kaaryava ke saath hi anna ke sahyogiyon se bhi lagaataar barta chal rahi thi
 But the government was not making its stand clear
 antat shaam tak in vaartaon kaa parinaam anna kii teen maangon par sansad ke samarthan ke prastaav ke rup main aayaa
 Vilas Rao Deshmukh again came to Ramlila Maidan with a letter from the Prime Minister to inform about it
 jiske pashchaat anna ne 28 agast ko anshan sthagit karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anna's weight had decreased by seven and a half kilos due to the 13-day fast
 unka rakt chaap kaaphi kam ho gaya tha
 Doctor Trehan, who has been continuously checking Anna's health for 13 days, said that Anna's body is deficient in water and he has become very weak
 unke swasthya par nazar rakhane ke liye unhen kuch dinon ke liye gudgaanv ke ek aspataal main bhartee kar liya gaya
 The whole country was engulfed in celebration with the announcement of Anna's demands in Parliament on 27 August and Anna's announcement of ending the fast on 28 August
 rajdhani dilli, mumbai, kolkata, patna, ranchi, lakhanu, bengaluru, shimla, jaipur, raipur, gandhinagar sahit puure desh main diwaali jaisaa maahaul ban gaya
 In Delhi, Anna Hazare's supporters reached India Gate waving the tricolor and shouting slogans to express their happiness
 log deshbhakti ke geeton par jhuumate najar aae
 Several individuals got out of the cars and joined the procession
 rajdhani raipur sahit chhattisgarh ke bilaspur, korba, raigarh main bhi anna hajaare samarthakon ne pataakhe jalaae or vijay ke uplakshya main naare lagaae
 If people left firecrackers in various mohallas of Patna, many people distributed sweets

 Many people went to the temple to thank God and pray for taking care of Anna Hazare's health
 patna ke saath hi rajya ke darbhanga, purniya, saharsa, mujffarpur, bhagalpur sahit kai jilon main is janata kii jeet kaa jasn manaaya gaya
 It was really only a moral victory
 itihaas jarur bana tha kintu kaagajon par kisi thos cheez kaa nikalakar aana abhi baaki tha
 Yes, it definitely made way for him
 anna ke teen sharton ke samarthan kaa prastaav sansad ne sthai samiti ko bhej diya tha jise maananaa uske liye kanoonee rup se baadhya nahin tha
 Further, the Standing Committee was empowered to analyze all these suggestions and also decide how practical they were
 sansad ne sarkaar ke us mul tark ko saidhantik rup se kaayam rakhaa tha ki kaanoon banane main sansad kii bhoomika sarvopari he or us par sawaal nahin uthaae ja sakate
 After a day-long debate in Parliament, DMK, Bahujan Samaj Party, Marxist Communist Party, Communist Party of India, Samajwadi Party and Biju Janata Dal had made it clear that Parliament should not play a role in the appointment of Lokayukta as it would give autonomy to the states
 Will be affected inamen se kuch dalon ne aise kisi qadam ke virodh karne kii manshaa bhi saafe kar di thi
 The Congress accepted to bring the lower bureaucracy under the Lokpal, but also said that a fundamental change in the legal and institutional structure is yet to be done
 saansadon ne jan lokapal bill kii sansad ke andar saansad ke vyavhaar ko lokapal ke kaary kshetra main laane kii dhara kaa dalgat bhaavana se upar uthakar ek swar main virodh kiya tha
 Many parties also opposed bringing the judiciary under its purview
 kuch dalon ne iske badale rashtriya nyaayik ayog banaae jane kii vakaalat kii or kuch ne majboot javabdehi vidheyak laane par jor diya tha
 The government did not give any promise on the issue of including the Prime Minister
 bhaajapa samet kai dalon ne kuch aihtiyaat ke saath pradhanmantri ko bhi isamen shaamil kiye jane kaa jarur samarthan kiya
 The final decision on how to bring two more important demands, the cbi's anti-corruption unit under the Lokpal and the dismissal of corrupt bureaucrats, was also left to the standing committee
 is janandolan ne raajnneetik dalon ke chehron par pade lokahitaishi nakaab ko hataakar swaarthee sattakankshi or janvirohi charitra ko spasht kar diya
 Along with the opposition parties, the most perverted face of it was the Indian National Congress, the ruling party at the center
 uske vakil mantriyon kapil sibbal, pi chidambaram aadi ne swayan ko shaasha evam anna hajaare kii team ko gulam maanakar tughluqi aadesh or bayaan jari kiye
 On 14 August, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari personally attacked Anna Hazare and said that Anna is corrupt
 iske liye unhone congress sarkaar dwaara gathit nyaayamurti saavant kii rapat kaa sandarbh diya tha, jisamen anna ko doshi tehraaya gaya tha
 He did not say that after the report of Justice Sawant, Sukhtankar Commission had investigated the issue and discharged Anna
 is andolan ne pradhanmantri manmohan singh, vitt mantri pranav mukherjee, congress mahasachiv rahul gandhi, ambika soni aadi ke saath hi vipaksh kii netaa sushamaa swaraj, laalkrishna adwani, seetaram yechuri aadi kaa kad bhi chota kar diya
 Manmohan Singh warned foreign powers to be behind this movement in Parliament
 ambika soni ne ise saaf karte hue america kaa naam ujagar kiya
 All the leaders repeatedly called for the supremacy of the Parliament and tried to make the efforts of the people chaotic
 ve yah bhul gaye ki bhartiya samvidhan kii prastaavna ham bharat ke log se shuru hoti he jo bharat ko samprabhu, loktantric, samaajawaadee or dharmanirpeksh banaaengen
 The benevolent and gregarious people of the government and those sitting in the government, left no stone unturned to suppress and break this movement, directly and indirectly
 gayi
 The personality and gratitude of Anna Hazare, the leader of the movement for taking the form of the national movement of the campaign against corruption, included the right and timely decisions of a skilled team
 arvind kejariwal, kiran vedi, prashanth bhushan aadi samarth logon kii team ne is andolan ko nirantar sahi raste par rakhaa or uske pathbhrasht hone kii gunjaaish samaapt kar di
 Yes, if anyone comes to our support, he is welcome
