 2014 main bangladesh ke khilaaf khilne ke saath hi ve bharat ke liye antarrashtriya match khilne vaale jammu kashmir ke pehle cricketer bane
 After a good 2012-13 Ranji season, Rasool was included in the India a squad for the one-day warm-up match against England on 6 January 2013

 4-0 se aage chal rahi team main jab antim match ke liye bhi rasul shaamil nahin kiye gayi to team prabandhan ke faisle par unke prashansakon ne hairaani jataayi
 Minister of State for Human Resource and Development Shashi Tharoor along with Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah criticized Rasool's neglect
 haalanki team prabandhan or captain ne is chayan ke peeche kisi durbhaavna se inkaar kiya
 In August 2013, Parvez Rasool was selected for the India 'A' team's South African tour

50 Alhnapur Chibramau is a village in Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh
 sansar main chaaron ore bhraman karke jis kisi ne jantujivan kaa adhyayan kiya he, vah jaanata he ki sansar main jantuon kaa vitaran sarvatra ek jaisaa nahin he, yadhyapi sansar ke har kone main praani milte hai
 Every part of the world has its own animals, ie animals found in Australia are not found in India and animals found in India are not found in Europe
 haska kadachit ek kaaran yah he ki jaanwaron main anukulan shakti kam hoti he
 Therefore, animals that thrive in one part's climate do not thrive in the other's climate
 kabhi kabhi es bhi hota he ki kisi vishesh jati ke jaanavar ke liye upyukt vaataavaran kahin par ho, par vah vahaan vishesh rukaawaton ke kaaran pahunch na sake
 There are also some animals that have left their original habitat and moved to other countries and thrive well there, such as rabbits in Australia, mongoose in Jamaica and English sparrow in the United States
 jantuon ke vitaran ke adhyayan ko 'jantu-vistaar-vigyaan' kehete hai
 It is a special branch of zoology
 jantuvistaar kaa adhyayan kai dhangon se hota he
 The first animal expansion is studied on the surface of the Earth, called geographic expansion or horizontal expansion
 iske pashchaat jaanwaron ke vistaar kaa adhyayan pahaad kii chotii se lekar samudr kii gaharaai tak karte hai
 This is called vertical or vertical extension, or vertical expansion
 in donon vistaaron ko avkaash main vistaar kehete hai
 In addition, the study of "" extension of time "" of animals is also called geological beds
 iskaa adhyayan bhuvigyaan kii sahaayta se hota he
 Each animal can be studied under all three sides, but to get a complete knowledge of animal expansion, it is necessary to study all three sides separately
 sankhya main kitni hi kam kyon na ho, par prayek jati kaa apana ek kshetra hota he
 Due to continuous breeding for a long time, their number increases so much that the area presented reduces for them; Therefore, caste is expanded to increase the area
 sankhya main vruddhi ke kaaran khaadya saamagree main bhi kami ho jaati he
 It is also a motivator of expansion
 jati kaa vistaar sthanantaran se hota he
 Often, the caste also increases its area by crossing the natural barriers
 is tarah spasht he ki vistaar ke do mukhya kaaran hai : Growth of population and badalata hua vaataavaran
 The pressure of increasing the population is the reason for rapid reproduction
 isi kaaran bhojan kii kami ho jaati he or aapas main spardhaa bad jaati he
 Competition between members of the same caste as well as rivalry from other related caste starts
 isse vah jati apni suraksha ke liye nae sthaan ko chal padati he
 The climate of each place is variable, which always changes slowly
 aisi avasthaa main yah swaabhaavik he ki lambii avadhi tak lagaataar parivartan hote rahane ke pashchaat, kisi vishesh sthaan kaa vaataavaran us jati ke rahane yogya nahin rah jaataa
 Now there are only two routes left for that caste, one is transfer and the other is extinction
 yadi prakritik rukaawaton ko paar karke baahar nikalne ke saadhan praapt hue, to vah jati us sthaan kaa chhodkar nae sthaan par chali jaati he or yadi ye saadhan na hue or upyukt raste na mili, to vah jati vilupt ho jaati he
 The study of fossils of elephants and horses shows that they have been moving from one place to another whenever the opportunity arose and that is why their species survived from extinction
 jantuon kaa pravrajan kai maaghon se hota he
 These routes depend on the environment conditions and natural blockages
 rukaawatein hone par bhi aise anek anya saadhan rahete hai, jinke dwaara jantu pravrajan karte hai, jaise vaayu, jal, prithvi ke pul, prakritik bede or tairti hui lakadiyaan aadi
 Some animals increase their territory with the help of their flying power

 jaanwaron ke samooh ke samooh ek sthaan ko jate rahete hai
 This type of migration trend is found in many species of animals
 praaia: bade bade mahadwipon ke bich prithvi ke prakritik pul paae jate hai, jin par se jaanavar aasaani se aa ja sakate hai
 Natural bridges in Suez and Panama are examples of this
 panama kaa pul vishesh rup se rochak he, isliye ki uski utpatti kaa itihaas bhi hamen bhalee-bhanti maaloom he
 Animals in North America and Eurasia have a similar relationship
 pehle ye donon mahapradesh ek duusare se prakritik pul dwaara jude the
 This natural bridge was at the place where there is currently the Bering Strait Strait

 The movement of animals from one place to another is called migration
 vastav main pravrajan us avaagaman ko kehete hai, jo badalte hue mausamon dwaara prerit hote hai
 Just as the seasons come and the sun continues to grow, so do the migrations of animals
 anek jaanavar, jinamein chalane phirane kii vishesh kshamta hoti he, surya ke saath chalate hai
 When the sun goes north, they go north and when they go south, they also go south
 pravrajan ke do mukhya rup hai, yadhyapi in donon main vishesh antar nahin he
 Almost all animals that eat grass live in groups
 inako adhik maatra main bhojan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he

 kuch jaanavar rituparivartan ke saath-saath atyadhik dur-dur tak chale jate hai
 Some climb the mountain peaks or descend on them
 isko lamberup pravrajan kehete hai
 There is a greater difference in the level of heat, humidity, etc
 from the top of the mountain to the bottom
 isliye jaise hi koi pahaad par chadhataa he, vah anubhav karata he ki kai prakaar kii jalwaayu se gujara he
 There are some animals, which migrate only on the surface of the Earth
 is prakaar ke pravrajan ko kshaitij pravrajan kehete hai
 The Caribou of northern Canada runs north in summer and south in Hemant
 ghaas khaanevaale junglee jaanwaron ke pravrajan ke udhaaharan paaltu jaanwaron ke avaagaman se bhinn hote hai
 Pets follow the signs of a shepherd, but wild animals are on the motive
 aisa anumaan he ki uttari america kaa gaval anek akshanshon se pravrajan kar chukaa he
 Large distance migrations are also considered as elaborate forms of local traffic, because their main reason is also the search for food
 pravrajan kaa doosraa kaaran santan kii suraksha kii pravriti he
 Many low-level animals are different at birth as parents and also eat different types of food
 isliye maan praaia: aise sthaan main andey detii he, jahaan bhavishya main bacchon ke kaam aanevaali sabhi chijen sulabh tathaa paryaapt hon
 To do this they often have to go far and wide to lay eggs
 aise pravrajan kaa udhaaharan chidiyon main miltaa he
 Some animals recognize their birthplace on the basis of their own inspiration and they also return to their birthplace for the upbringing of their children
 maatrutivbhaar se nivrutt hokar ve pun: vahaan chale jate hai, jahaan se aae the
 They either die when they arrive there or they reach their birthplace in the second season to lay eggs again
 pravrajan ke ye donon rup samyaanukool avaagaman ke yatharth udhaaharan hai
 Whether a creature is affected, a generation, these migrations are automatic in the same way as the motion of the Earth
 yah rituon kii prerana ke kaaran hota he
 Timeliness and return to movement are its specialty
 kuch chidiyon main aniyamit pravrajan bhi miltaa he
 The birds do not return to the place from which they move
 kuch pravrajan karanevaali chidiyaan sahasron mile nil jaati hai
 Take the cuckoo for example
 yah fijo se newjiland tak jaati he or waapas aati he
 Both of these locations are over 1,500 miles
 asia kaa sunahalaa pluvar 2,000 mile kii duuri tay karke alaska se hawaii tak jaataa he, raste main aaraam tak nahin karata
 The main reason why there is a migration is not known, but there are some such trends, which lead to migration
 inamen pramukh he, pakshiyon kii ativiksit ant:prerana or nae kshetra main bhojan saamagree kii sulabhta
 Some animals are usually confined to a single area
 kshetra kii bhautik avasthaa tathaa vaataavaran ke atirikt jaanwaron kaa avaagaman prakritik baadhaon par bhi nirbhar he
 These barriers are of different types: jalwaayu sambandhi, bhugolic tathaa jeevigyaan sambandhi
 Among them, heat, humidity and light are notable
 garmi jaanwaron ke vistaar kaa mahatvapurn kaaran he
 Heat has a greater effect on the expansion of asymmetric beings
 asamtapi praaniyon kaa taap vaataavaran ke taap ke saath ghatata badhata rahata he
 Therefore, they can neither tolerate excess heat nor excess cold
 ubhaychar tathaa urag ushn tathaa shitoshna bhaagon main paae jate hai or dhruv pradeshon kii ore ye kam hote jate hai
 Gharials are found in warm and temperate countries, turtles are found up to 50 degrees north latitude
 chhipakali 60 degree akshansh ke baad nahin milti
 The area of snakes is large, yet limited
 yahi kaaran he ki sheetapradeshon main keval pakshi or standhari praani hi paae jate hai
 There are also some of the mammals, which are found according to temperature
 sher bharat tathaa malaya jaise ushn pradeshon kaa rahanevaala hai, parantu yah cokeshas tathaa altaai pahaado kii chotiyon or manchuriya ke thande bhaagon main bhi miltaa he
 An elephant can also tolerate cold if it gets a large amount of water
 bhartiya hathi thande pahaad kii chotiyon main vaise hi aaraam ke saath rahata he, jaise neeche maidaanon main
 Humidity barrier - a study of animals living in the desert suggests that humidity also affects the expansion of animals, although there are some animals that can tolerate extreme dryness
 adhiktar bade bade registan jaanwaron ke vistaar main baadhak ban jate hai
 Sahara is notable among them
 hiran jaise tivrgami praani bhi pani kii kami taap ke kaaran inako paar nahin kar pate
 That is why deer are not found in a large country like Africa
 ve keval uttar main hi milte hai
 In other countries, where there is a climate like Africa, they are very common
 arab kaa registan bhi isi tarah jaanwaron ke vistaar main baadhak ban jaataa he
 The increase of humidity also hinders the expansion of some special animals
 spasht he ki ardrata kii adhikta se daldali vaataavaran utpann ho jaataa he, jise anek jaanavar vijit nahin kar pate
 The seas, rivers, mountains and deserts are counted under geographical constraints
 bharat ke uttar main himalay kii vishaal parvatamala he
 Not every type of animal can cross it
 isaki himachhadit chotiyon ke upar sa chidiyaan tak nahin ud paatin
 For this reason, the animals found in its north are completely different from those found in the south
 bumadhyarekha ke samaantar parvatamalaon kaa prabhaav jantuon ke vistaar par, uttar-dakshin disha main sthit parvatamalaon se adhik hota he
 The Himalayan Mountains are thus one of the most important obstacles in the world
 pashchimi sanyukt rajya kii parvatamalas vistaar par prabhaav daalati hai
 As the winds from the Pacific Ocean pass through these ranges, they release their moisture and, as previously stated, only this moisture has an effect on the ecosystem
 himalay kii bhanti uttari america kaa pathaar bhi aisi seemaa banaata he, jiske idhar udhar ke jaanavar ek duusare se bhinn hai
 Large aquatic parts of the Earth separate the animals living on the Earth

 Seawater becomes a barrier for freshwater fish
 phir bhi kuch machhliyaan, saaman or stergian hai, jo saal main ek baar lavniya jal se mithe jal main aa jaati hai
 Eels have opposite movements
 aadhunik ubhaycharon ke liye lavniya jal gambhir baadha khadi karata he, kyonki lavniya jal inke liye vish kaa kaary karata he
 That is why it has not reached other islands except the islands of Fiji, Salomon and New Caledonia
 dumwale ubhaychar jaise neut, syran or salamander ityadi keval prithvi ke uttarardh main paae jate hai, kyonki dakshini bhaag ke mahadweep samudron sa ghire hai
 The continents of Africa and the southern part are surrounded by seas
 africa or dakshini america inamen aise desh hai, jo prithvi ke mukhya bhaagon se jude hai
 But the amphibious amphibians have not even reached these countries, because the paths through which they could go are long and these animals are so lethargic that they cannot go so far
 prithvi ko khedkar rahanevaale ubhaychar, jinhen sicilian kehete hai, dakshini america, africa, uttari bharat, sumatra, jaav tathaa borneo aadi main paae jate hai
 All these areas are parts of the old southern continent, which are now separated
 mechak tathaa unke sambandhi kaa vitaran adhik he, parantu ve bhi samudri tapuon main nahin pahunch paae hai
 The sea is not a deterrent for the Urugas like sea turtles
 yadhyapi iskaa taap inke avaagaman ko simit karata he
 Snakes are efficient swimming animals, but they also do not cross large portions of water
 jal un pakshiyon ke vitaran main baadhak banataa he, jo ud nahin sakate, jaise shaturmurg tathaa newzealand nivasi chidiya kiwi aadi
 Mammalian animals also cannot cross large reservoirs in large numbers, they can swim for more than 50 miles in water
 hwel or sil aadi standhari praani iske apwaad hai, kyonki jalashay inke vitaran main koi baadha nahin daalate
 Skilled swimmers like Jaguar cross the largest rivers of South America, but they are not able to go far into the sea
 sher, hathi or hiran aadi ko jal ati priy he, parantu shaayad ve bhi prithvi se dur janaa pasand nahin karte
 Animal distribution expert Hylprin says that many mammals living on Earth, who are ready to cross Europe's largest reservoirs, only to cross 50 miles or more than half of the sea Will not be easily prepared for ye praaia: nivasasthaan se sambandhit hoti hai
 It is often seen that animals coming from some other place do not grow in the new place
 kabhi ve khaadya saamagree kii kami se or kabhi shatruon kii bahutayat se mar jate hai
 The dense vegetation yields become a means of distribution for some animals, then a hindrance for some
 vitaran par vanaspati kaa prabhaav pratyaksh or apratyaksh donon prakaar se padataa he
 The animals that live on the trees of the dense forests are not able to cross the undisturbed forests
 isi tarah kahin kahin jangal itane ghaney hote hai ki prithvi par rahanevaale bade-bade jaanavar inhen paar nahin kar pate
 This is what happened to Mastodan
 yah uttari america se dakshini america to aa gaya, par ghaney jangalon ke kaaran mexico se dakshin kii ore nahin ja sakaa
 Similarly the lack of vegetation also affects the distribution of animals
 vanar-gana ushn pradeshon ke ghaney jangalon main rahete hai or vriksh unki suraksha, avaagaman tathaa bhojan ke liye aavashyak hote hai
 They eat fruits, flowers and buds and insects and birds living on trees
 yadi upyukt jangal na milen to inkaa nirvaah nahin ho saktaa
 That is why primitives are not found in forest-less parts
 ghaney jangalon ke rahanevaale pakshi tathaa keede bhi jangalviheen bhaagon main nahin paae jate
 The soil becomes a barrier to the animals digging the earth
 fayritaima naamak kechua vishesh prakaar kii mitti main paaya jaataa he or utafius duusare prakaar kii mitti main
 There are some animals that can bill in dry sandy ground, while there are some that bill in moist and smooth soil
 iskaa taatpary yah hua ki mitti kii bhautik, rasinic evam jeevigyaneey avasthaa bhi jantuvitaran main rukaawat ban jaati he
 This type of obstacle is called land related obstacle

 He wrote a proverb called 'rajiya Ra Duha'
 ve raav raja devi singh ke samay main hue the
 The poet Kriparam ji was the son of Jagram ji of the Charan caste of Khidia branch, resident of Kharadi village in the then Marwar state
 He lived in the court of Rao Raja Devisingh of Sikar in Shekhawati region of Rajasthan
 Father Jagram ji was given the jagir of Jasuri village by Thakur Jalim Singh ji, the ruler of Kuchaman of Nagaur
 This scholar poet was born there
 Being the best poet and good scholar of Rajasthani language Dingle and Pingal, be impressed by his scholarly and virtue, Rao Raja Laxman Singh Ji of Sikar gave them villages in Maharajpur and Lachhmanpura in Jagir in 1847 and 1858
 rajia raa sauratha "rajia Ra Sauratha" is the most famous among the Rajasthani Soraths related to policy, there is no other Doha collection in front of them, both in terms of language and sentiment
 This is probably the first work in the form of speech poetry
 These Sauraths were composed by the famous poet Kriparam Ji of Rajasthan while addressing his servant Rajia
 Legend has it that in order to immortalize his son-less servant Rajia, a scholar poet had composed a couple of policy related addresses while addressing him
 It is believed that the number of Soraths composed by Kriparam has been around 500, but so far only 170 couplets have been reported
 About 125 of them are authentically his works
 rajia kriparam kaa naukar tha
 usne kavi kriparam kii acchhee seva kii thi
 uski seva se prasann hokar kavi ne usase kaha ki main tera naam amar kar duungaa
 aisa bhi prasiddh he ki rajia ke koi santan nahin thi, jisase vah udhaas rahaa karata tha uski udhaas akruti dekhakar kriparam ne uski udaasi kaa kaaran poocha
 tab rajia ne kaha "mere koi santan nahin hai or santan ke abhaav main meraa vansh aage nahin chalegaa or meraa naam hi sansar se lupt ho jayega
"is par kavi ne usase kaha- 'tu chintaa mat kar tera naam lupt nahin hoga, main tera naam amar kar duungaa
 Then poet Kripa Ram composed the couplets of Niti and through him he has truly immortalized the name of Razia
 The poet composed these couplets while addressing Razia
 At the end of each couplet comes the 'rajiya' address
 ye dohe bhi rajia ke dohe yaa rajia re saurathe naam se hi prasiddh hue

 "shortly before i came along, there was another arrival in Três Corações: electricity
 In order to celebrate this great improvement to our daily lives, Dondinho named me Edson, a tribute to Thomas Edison, the inventor of the lightbulb
 In fact, on my birth certificate i am actually called Edison with an 'i', a mistake that persists to this day
 I'm Edson with no 'i', but to my eternal annoyance quite often the 'i' appears on official or personal documents and time after time i have to explain why
 As if that wasn't confusing enough, they got the date wrong on my birth certificate as well -- it says 21 oktober
 I'm not sure how this came about; probably because in Brazil we're not so fussy about accuracy
 This is another mistake that carries on to this day
 When i took out my first passport, the date was put in as 21 oktober and each time i have renewed it the date has stayed the same

 The effect of the mother's efficient upbringing and the rites she received was evident in the days following Sir Syed, when he came to the field of social upliftment
 22 varsh kii avasthaa main pita kii mrityu ke baad parivaar ko aarthik kathinaaiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa or thodi si shiksha ke baad hi unhen aajeevika kamaane main laganaa padaa

 unka ghar tabah ho gaya, nikat sambandhiyon kaa qatl hua, unki maan jaan bachaakar ek saptaah tak ghode ke astabal main chuphi raheen
 Seeing this ruin of his family, his mind got distracted and a wave of patriotism started taking place in his heart and mind
 is bechaini se unhone pareshaan hokar bharat chhodane or misr main basane kaa faisalaa kiya
 The British sent Mir Sadiq and Mir Rustom Ali to him to lure them towards him and lured him to give Talluka Jehanabad

 He could live the life of a wealthy man, but he was a very intelligent and intelligent person
 unhone us vaqt laalach ko buree bhalaa samajhakar thukraa di or rashtrabhakti ko apnaanaa behatar samajha
 Later he realized that if the Muslims of India were not removed from this cell, then one day our people would be ruined and ruined and they would never get up
 isliye unhone misr jane kaa iraadaa badal diya or kalyaan va astitv kii mashaal lekar apni qaom or mulq kii taraf badhane lage
 It is true that he sheltered non-british Britishers in his home, but his supporters were not at all, but he was a lover of Islamic education and culture
 unki duuradrushti angrezon ke shadyantra se acchhee tarah se vaaqif thi
 He knew that the British rule had been established on India and he thought it better to defeat the educational ground
 isliye apane behtareen lekhon ke madhyam se qaom main shiksha va samskruti kii bhaavana jagaane kii koshish kii taaki shaikshik maidan main koi hamaari qaom par haaavee na ho sake
 The Muslims continued to give them the fatfar of Kufr, despite not becoming an enemy of its people or deteriorating, but kept trying to explain them with tenderness
 ve acchhee tarah se jaanate the ki yah qaom jaahil he, isliye unki baton kii parvaah kiye bina ve apni manzil par pahunchne ke liye koshish karte rahe
 Today the Muslim community accepts what Sir Syed Ahmad Khan did not do anything for the community
 muslim raajnneeti main sar saiyad kii parampara muslim lig ke rup main ubhari
 His propaganda against the Indian National Congress was that the Congress was a Hindu hegemony party and that Propaganda lived among the Muslims of pre-independence India
 kuch apwaadon ko chhodkar ve congress se dur rahe or yahan tak ki ve azaadi kii ladaai se bhi hissaa nahin liya
 It is no surprise that almost all the freedom fighters in the Muslim-majority states of British India such as Bengal and Punjab were Hindus or Sikhs
 inaki mrityu 27 march 1898 ko hriday gati ruk jane ke kaaran hui

 In vitro fertilization) is the process in which egg cells are fertilized by sperms outside the uterus, ie in vitro
 jab sahaayta-praapt prajnan takanic kii anya paddatiyaan asafal ho jaati hai, to ivief bandhyataa kaa ek pramukh upachaar hota he
 In this process, the ovarian process is controlled by hormones and the ovaries are extracted from the woman's ovaries and fertilized by sperm in a liquid medium

 The Latin origin word in vitro, meaning within the glass, was used because the early biological experiments that took place to promote the tissues of living beings outside the body of the animal were all used in glassware
 , Eg, were made in beakers, test tubes, or petri dishes
 aaj kritrim pariveshi shabd kaa upyog aisi kisi bhi jeevvaigyanik prakriya ke liye kiya jaataa he jo us jeev se baahar kii jaati he jiske bheetar vah saamanytah ghatati he

 This is done when the parents are facing infertility problems or they want more than one infant
 It is considered the most effective technique of artificial insemination in women
 aamtaur par iskaa prayog tab karte hai jab mahila kii andwahi naliyaan band hone hai yaa jab mard bahut kam shukranu paidaa kar paata he
 In this process, many times, eggs donated by others, donated semen or already frozen mbarayas are also used
 daan main die gaye andon kaa prayog un striyon ke liye kiya jaataa he he jo ki anda utpann nahin kar paatin
 Similarly, the eggs or semen donated in charity are also sometimes used for women who have a congenital disease in which the child is also afraid of getting it

 Currently IVF has a number of technologies in operation including ICSI, ZIFT, GIFT and PGD
 isiesai kaa prayog us sthiti main kiya jaataa he jab andon kii sankhya kam hoti he yaa phir shukranu, andanu se kriya karne laayak behatar avasthaa main nahin hote
 In this, the sperms are injected directly into the ovaries by the micromanipulation technique
 jedft main mahila ke andanuon ko nikaal kar unhen nishechit kar mahila ke garbhashay main sthapit karne ke bajaae uske fallopin tachub main sthapit kiya jaataa he
 The process of IVF is completed in the form of superovulation, egg retrieval, fertilization, and embryo transfer
 iskaa prayog ve mahilaayein bhi kar sakati hai jinamein rajonivritti ho chuki he or fallopian tub band ho cheke hai
 Thus, this facility proves to be a boon
 jed ai epa tii bhi ai ve epa ke sadrush hota he
 The quotation is done in the laboratory

 Under GIFT, eggs and semen are transferred to the oviduct tube of the woman
 urvaran mahila ke sharir main hi hota he
 In ICSI, only one sperm is injected into the fertilized egg
 tab bhrun ko garbhashay yaa andwahi tub main transfer kiya jaataa he
 It is used for couples who have severe semen disease
 kabhi kabhi iskaa upyog aayu main bade dampatiyon ke liye bhi kiya jaataa he yaa jinka ai ve epa kaa prayaas asafal rahaa ho
 IVF can be used to treat infertility in women due to problems with the fallopian tubes, as fertilization is difficult within the body in such situations
 yah vidhi purush bandhyataa main bhi sahaayak ho sakati he, jahaan shukranuon kii gunvattta main kharabi ho
 or aise maamalon main intracitoplasmik sperm injection kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he, jahaan ek shukranu koshika ko sidhe dimb koshika main inject kiya jaataa he
 This method is used when sperm have problems entering the ovum, and in these situations the sperm of the partner or donor can also be used
 isiesai kaa upyog tab bhi kiya jaataa he jab shukranuon kii sankhya bahut kam ho
 isiesai kii safalataa kii dar ivief nishechan kii safalataa kii dar ke baraabar hoti he
 It is easy to say that the success of IVF simply requires a healthy egg, fertilized sperm and a uterus to conceive
 lekin is prakriya kii ucch laagat ke kaaran aam taur par ivief kaa prayaas anya saare saste vikalpon ke vifal hone ke baad hi kiya jaataa he
 It can also be done for egg donation or substitute motherhood where the woman providing the egg is not the woman who will complete the pregnancy period
 This means that IVF can be used for women who have undergone menopause
 daan kii gai dimbanujanakoshika ek crucible main nishechit kii ja sakati he
 If fertilization is successful, the zygote or fertilization is transferred to the uterus, within which it develops into an embryo
 anuvaanshik vikaron kii gaiyr-maujuudagi kii pushti karne ke liye preimplantesan genetic diagnosis ke saath bhi ivief kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 a similar but more general test has been developed called preimplantation genetic haplotyping

 Injectable gonadotropins are used in most patients under intensive monitoring
 aisi monitering main samay samay par estradeol staron ko dekha jaataa he or gayanacologic ultrasonographi ke zarie putakon kii badhat dekhi jaati he
 Injections will usually be required for about 10 days
 During this cycle, natural ovulation is usually prevented with the use of gnrh agonists that begin before or during stimulation, or with the use of gnrh antagonists that are used only during the last days of stimulation; Both factors block the natural overgrowth of luteinizing hormones, and the physician can initiate the process of ovulation with the help of drugs, usually injectable human coronary gonadotropins
 jab yah tay kiya jaataa he putakeey paripakvata upyukt he, to human korionic gonedotropins diya jaataa he
 This factor, acting as an analogue of luteinizing hormone, caused ovulation to occur 42 hours after injection, but a recovery process commenced just before that to receive the ovarian cells from the ovary
 ek transvazinal takanic kii sahaayta se rogi se dimb punah praapt kiye jate hai jisamen ek ultrasound chalit sui yoni kii diwaar ko bhed kar dimb grathiyon tak pahunchati he
 The needle can be suctioned by this needle and this follicular fluid is sent to the IVF laboratory to identify the eggs
 aam taur par das se tees dimb nikaale jate hai
 This recovery process takes about 20 minutes and is usually done under conscious mitigation or general anesthesia
 prayogshaala main, pahachaane gaye dimbon se unke ird gird kii koshikaayen nikaal kar dimbon ko nishechan ke liye taiyaar kiya jaataa he
 To select eggs with optimum opportunities for successful conception, oocyte selection can be done before fertilization
 is bich, veery ko nishechan hetu taiyaar karne ke liye usamen se niskriy koshikaon or veery drav ko nikaal diya jaataa he
 This process is called sperm secretion
 yadi veery kisi shukranu daandaata dwaara uplabdh karaayaa gaya he, to aam taur par use upachaar ke liye taiyaar karne ke baad jamaaya or roganurahit kiya jayega or upyog ke liye taiyaar karne hetu use pighalaaya jayega
 The sperm and the egg are incubated in a culture medium at a ratio of 75,000: 1 for about 18 hours
 adhikansh sthitiyon main, is samay tak andanu nishechit ho jaataa he or nishechit andanu do proneuclius dikhaata he
 a sperm can be injected directly into the egg using some conditions, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection) in low sperm count or motility
 nishechit andanu ko vishesh vikaas madhyam main rakh kar lagbhag 48 ghanton ke liye chhod diya jaataa he jab tak ki andanu main chah se aath koshikaayen na ho jaaen
 In the Gammit introphallopian transfer method, the eggs are removed from the woman's body and placed in one of the fallopian tubes of the woman along with the male's sperm
 isse stri ke sharir ke bheetar nishechan kii prakriya sampann hoti he
 Therefore, this diversity is actually in vivo fertilization, not artificial inertial fertilization
 aam taur par bhrun ko punah prapti ke baad 6-8 koshika kii avasthaa main pahunchane tak sanvardhit kiya jaataa he
 Although in many Canadian, American and Australian programs, embryos are housed in a long culture system and transfer is performed about five days after retrieval at the blastocyst stage, especially if there are still many high quality embryos available on the third day
 It has been observed that blastocyst phase transfers result in higher conception rates
 europe main 2 dinon ke baad sthanantaran aam baat he
 Embryos can be cultured in artificial culture medium or in autologous endometrial coculture
 kritrim sanvardhan madhyam main, yaa to sari avadhi main ek hi sanvardhan madhyam ho saktaa he, yaa ek kramik pranali kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he, jisamen bhrun ko alag-alag madhyamon main kramik rup se rakhaa jaataa he
 For example, while culturing in the blastocyst stage, culturing can be done in one medium for up to 3 days and then another medium can be used
 madhyam blastocyst charan main maanav bhrun ke liye ekal yaa kramik donon samaan rup se prabhavi hote hai
 The artificial embryo culture medium basically contains glucose, pyruvate, and energetic ingredients, but the addition of amino acids, nucleotides, vitamins, and cholesterol makes the fetal development process even better
 dimbanujanakoshika or bhrun kii gunvattta parakhane ke liye prayogshaalaon ne grading kii vidhiyaan viksit kii hai
 To optimize conception rates, there is strong evidence that the morphological scoring system is the best solution for embryo selection

 Embryos are classified by embryologists based on the number of cells, the symmetry of growth, and the magnitude of fragmentation
 hastantarit kii jane vaali sankhya uplabdh sankhya, stri kii aayu or anya swasthya sambandhi or naidanik karkon par nirbhar hoti he
 In countries such as Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, a maximum of two embryos are usually transferred, except in exceptional circumstances
 euke main or ) niyamon ke anusaar, 40 varsh se adhik aayu kii mahila ke sharir main adhiktam teen bhrun hastantarit kiye ja sakate hai, jabaki uese main vyaktigat prajnankshmata nidaan ke aadhaar par yuva mahilaon main kai bhrun hastantarit kiye ja sakate hai
 The effort of most clinics and national regulatory bodies is to minimize the risk of conceiving with more than one infant
 Embryos chosen as the "best" are transferred to the patient's uterus by a thin, plastic tube leading to the patient's vagina and cervix
 aropan or garbhaadhan kii sambhaavnaaon ko behatar karne ke liye garbhashay main kai bhrun pravisht karaae ja sakate hai
 The success rate of conception is called conception rate
 ivief kii sthiti main yah sabhi prayaason kaa vah pratishat hota he jiske falswaroop garbhaadhan hota he, jiskaa arth aam taur par upachaar chakron se hota he jinamein dimb punah praapt karke unhen kritrim pariveshi nishechan kiya jaataa he
 "pregnancy" data may be indicative of a positive pregnancy test and not necessarily a "viable conception", which indicates the fetal beats
 jin garbhaadhanon ke falswaroop jivit shishu janm hota he, unhen jivit janm dar kehete hai
 Nowadays in most cases a distinction is made between single and twin or more than one conception, because more than one, especially more than twin, pregnancies should be avoided as they carry many risks for the mother and the fetus
 unnat takanic kii madad se kuch varsh pehle kii tulana main aaj garbhaadhan kii daren kaafii behatar ho gai hai
 In 2006, the average rate of conception in Canadian clinics was found to be 35%
 frans main ek shodh main yah anumaan lagaaya gaya ki ivief upachaar aarambh karne vaale rogiyon main 66% rogiyon ko antat shishu prapti hui upachaar ke dauraan or 26% ko ivief upachaar band karne ke baad)
 ivief upachaar band karne ke baad shishu janm mukhyatah dattak lene ke kaaran yaa sahaj garbhaadhan ke kaaran hua
 The live birth rate is the percentage of all IVF cycles that result in infant birth and this rate is equal to the conception rate adjusted for miscarriage and stillbirth
 yah pratishat safal garbhaadhanon ke liye hai, janme shishuon kii sankhya chaahe jo bhi ho, kyonki ivief chakron main adhikansh judawaan or usase adhik shishuon kaa janm dekha gaya he
 In 2006 Canadian clinics found a rapid birth rate of 27%

 Older patients also had lower success rates and were declining with age, with a 37

 kuch clinicon main ye daren adhik thim, lekin yah tay karnaa asambhav he ki aisa ucchtar takanic yaa rogi ke chayan ke kaaran hua tha, kyonki sabase mushkil rogiyon ko manaa karke yaa unhen dimbanujanakoshika daata chakra main shaamil karke safalataa kii daron ko kritrim rup se badhaayaa ja saktaa he

 In that case, it is a well-known fact that whatever the volume of the body, or its velocity, or the density of the liquid, will be the generation of homogeneous airflows from homogeneously moving bodies
 drav taral ke liye bhi yah satya he
 If velocities larger than 400 mph are encountered, then for symmetry, it is important to keep in mind that the velocities in aquifer experiments have the same ratio of aqueous soundwave as those in airborne experiments, ie the water velocities are approximately four times that of air velocities
 Are
 shyanta se prabhavit taral pravahon main samarupata ke liye aavashyak he ki donon kii renold sankhya, pvl m, vahi rahe

 yadi kisi pravaah kii renold sankhya laghu he, jo us gati main shyanta kaa mahatvapurn prabhaav hoga or vah sire, yaa baari tel, ke jaisaa pravaah degaa
 One of the conclusions of the theory of presumptive liquid is that if a body moves in a liquid that is only left at rest due to the body, then the flow type of the body is uniquely determined by the size and speed of the body
 And the resultant pressure that the liquid exerts at various points on the body is zero, even if their moment is not zero
