 Partly as a result of this case, the Court of Criminal Appeal was formed in 1907, thus Conan Doyle not only helped George Edalji, but his creations also helped to create a way to heal other justice's aberrations

 Houdini was apparently unable to convince Conan Doyle that his feats were straightforward delusions, which led to a bitter public debate between the two

 Tolstoy has a notable influence on great writers such as Galsvardi, Thomas Mann, Jules Romeo, etc
 parvarti roosi lekhakon ko bhi tollstoy ne yathesht prabhavit kiya he
 Many scholars of the world, including Lenin, have accepted the best of Tolstoy's literature, especially 'war and Peace', from Muktakantha; But Tolastoy was also a thinker and expressed his ideas in literary works as well as in essays and other genres
 unke yugin sandarbh vichaaron kii upyogita ke sambandh main lenin kaa maananaa he ki "tolastoy ne aisa lalit sahitya rachaa he, jo tab janata ke liye sadaa moolyawaan or pathneey hoga, jab vah jameendaaron or puunjipatiyon kaa takhta ulat kar apane liye manuyochit saamaajik jivan kii vyavastha kar legi
 At the same time, Tolstoy has been able to express the mood of the general public and describe his condition, and express his spontaneous feelings of protest and fury with remarkable oz
 tolastoy mukhyatah 1861 se 1904 tak ke yug ke the or unhone -- ek kalakaar, vichaarak evam upadeshak ke naate -- apni kritiyon main samoochee pratham roosi kranti kii aitihaasik vishistataaon ko, uski kshamtaaon or trutiyon ko ascharyajanak spashtataa ke saath ubhaara he
 " iske baavjood pracheen vyavastha kii vividh khaamiyon, amir varg kii aantarik nissartaa tathaa uske viruddh prakat tolastoy ke vichaaron ke sandarbh main lenin kaa kahana he ki "tolastoy kii aalochana main koi nayi baat nahin thi
 He did not say anything that had not been said to him long ago by the advocates of the working people in European and Russian literature
 tolastoy kii aalochana kii visheshta evam aitihaasik mahatv is baat main he ki hamaare vichaaradhin kaal ke rus -- dehati, kisaanon ke rus -- ke vyapak jan samudaay ke drushtikon main jo amul parivartan aa rahaa tha, uski abhivyakti usamen aise ojase kii gayi he, jo kisi pratibhavan kalakaar ke hi bas kaa kaam tha
 " tolastoy ke saahitiyik mahatv ko lenin bakhubi samajhate the or isliye unhone uski baari prashansa bhi kii he; parantu saath-saath yugin sandarbh main unke vichaaron ke kai hanikaarak pahaluon se sachet rahane kii anivaaryta bhi ve acchhee tarah samajhate the
 Therefore, in December 1910, he had explicitly expressed the idea that by studying Tolstoy's literary works, the Russian working class would be able to recognize its enemies better
 unke siddhanton kaa adhyayan karke samast roosi janata yah jarur jaanegi ki uski nijee kamajori, jisane use apni aazaadee kaa lakshya puraa karne se roka, kis baat main nihit thi
 It is important to know in order to move forward
 is pragati main vah sab log baadha daal rahe hai, jo tolastoy ko 'ham sabakaa antahkaran', 'jivan-shikshak' ghoshit karte hai
 This is the lie that liberals are deliberately spreading as they want to use the anti-revolution aspect of Tolstoy's principles
 tolastoy ke 'jivan-shikshak' hone kaa jhooth udaarataavaadiyon kii dekha-dekhi kuch bhootpurv saamaajik-janavaadee bhi duhara rahe hai
 The Russian people will gain independence only if they understand that they have to learn to fight for a better life, not from Tolstoy, but from a class whose importance Tolstoy could not understand and that old world, which Tolstoy hated
 , Is the only class capable of overthrow - that is, from the proletariat
 22 janvari 1911 ko lenin ne punah vistaar se tolastoy kii kuch kathatmak rachanaaon ke saath-saath anek cathetar rachanaaon kaa udhaaharan dete hue yah vichaar vyakt kiya tha ki tolastowad main pratikriyaavaadi tathaa utapian tatv hone ke baavjood aaj se 25 varsh pehle janata ke kuch halkon ke liye shaayad kabhi-kabhi tolastoy ke siddhanton ke aalochanatmak tatwon kii vyavhaarik upyogita ho sakati thi
 But now, for example in the last decade, such a thing could not happen, because from the ninth decade of the last century to the end of the century, historical development has moved very far

 History and Contribution of Newspaper: Although a newspaper is considered as a beginning by a former officer of British rule, but its form was not like that of newspapers
 vah keval ek panne kaa suchanaatmak parchaa tha
 The Purnarupen newspaper was brought out of Bengal by Viceroy Hickey under the name of 'bengal-gazette'
 aarambh main angrejon ne apane phaayde ke liye akhabaaron kaa istemaal kiya, chunki saare akhbaar angreji main hi nikal rahe the, isliye bahusankhyak logon tak khabaren or suchnaayen pahunch nahin paati thim
 The news that came out and passed through the system, used to spread its terror there
 unke khilaaf na to mukademe hote or na hi unhen koi dand hi diya jaataa tha
 People were silent despite facing these hellish circumstances
 is dauraan bharat main ‘da hindustan times’, ‘neshnal herald', 'pyniyar', 'mumbai-mirar' jaise akhbaar angreji main nikalate the, jisamen un atyaacharon kaa dur-dur tak ullekh nahin rahata tha
 In addition to these English papers, letters were published in Bangla, Urdu etc
 but the scope was limited
 use koi bengali padhane vaala yaa urdu jaanane vaala hi samaj saktaa tha
 In such a situation, the first issue of Hindi's first letter 'udant Martand' was published on 30 May 1826
 yah patr saptahik tha
 The introduction of 'udant-martand' attempted to tie people together at the linguistic level
 yah keval ek patr nahin tha, balki un hajaaron logon kii jubaan tha, jo ab tak khamosh or bhaybheet the
 The introduction of letters in Hindi led to a revolutionary change in the country and the war of independence
 unhen kaaphi tod-marodakar prastut kiya jaataa tha, taaki angreji sarkaar ke atyaacharon kii khabaren dabi rah jaaen
 British soldiers entered any area and behaved arbitrarily
 lut, hatya, balaatkaar jaisi ghatnaayen aam hoti thim
 Whichever area he found a new direction
 ab logon tak desh ke kone-cone main ghat rahi ghatnaon kii jaankaree pahunchne lagi
 But shortly after, Jugal Kishore, the editor of this letter, had to close the letter on 11 December 1827 for lack of assistance
 10 may 1829 ko bengal se hindi akhbaar 'bangadoot' kaa prakaashan hua
 This letter also became the voice of the people and a medium to keep them connected
 iske baad july, 1854 main shyamsundar sen ne kalakatta se ‘samachar sudhaa varshan’ kaa prakaashan kiya
 During that time, any newspaper or newspaper published any news or article against the British Government, it had to pay its price
 akhabaaron ko pratibandhit kar diya jaataa tha
 Its copies were burnt, its publishers, editors, writers were punished
 un par baari-bharkam jurmaana lagaaya jaataa tha, taaki wo dubaara phir uthne kii himmat na juta paaen
 As the wave of independence was spreading across the country, newspapers were also becoming more and more tolerant of atrocities
 yahi vajah thi ki bengal vibhaajan ke uparaant hindi patron kii aawaaj or buland ho gai
 Lokmanya Tilak edited 'kesari' and Lala Lajpat Rai took out the letter 'vande Mataram' from Punjab
 in patron ne yuvaaon ko aazaadee kii ladaai main adhik-se-adhik sahyog dene kaa aahvaan kiya
 These letters created a passion for independence
 ‘kesari’ ko nagpur se madhavrao sapre ne nikaala, lekin tilak ke uttejk lekhon ke kaaran is patr par pabandi laga di gai
 Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi started publishing the weekly letter 'pratap' from Kanpur in 1913 to revive the freedom struggle in North India
 isamen desh ke har hisse main ho rahe atyaacharon ke bare main jaankariyaan prakashit hoti thim
 This triggered outrage among the people and they were even more excited to overthrow the British rule
 isaki aakraamakata ko dekhte hue angrej prashasan ne iske lekhakon, sampadakon ko tarah-tarah kii pratadnaayen deen, lekin yah patr apane lakshya par data rahaa
 Similarly, letters were being published from the areas of Bengal, Bihar and Maharashtra
 un patron ne logon main swatantraaa ko paane kii lalak or jaagrukta failaane kaa prayaas kiya
 If it is said that these newspapers were not inferior to any weapon for freedom fighters, then there would be no exaggeration
 akhbaar bane aazaadee kaa hathiyaar press aaj jitna swatantra or mukhar dikhataa he, aazaadee kii jang main yah utani hi bandishon or paabandiyon se bandhaa hua tha
 Neither was there a form of entertainment in it nor was it a source of income
 ye akhbaar or patr-patrikas aazaadee ke jaanbaajon kaa ek hathiyaar or madhyam the, jo unhen logon or ghatnaon se jode rakhata tha
 There was no such warrior of the freedom struggle, who did not try to speak through the newspapers
 gandhiji ne bhi ‘harijan’, ‘yang-india’ ke naam se akhabaaron kaa prakaashan kiya tha to moulana abul kalam aaazaad ne 'al-hilaal' patr kaa prakaashan
 There are many other examples that prove that newspapers and magazines had an important role in the freedom struggle
 yah vah daur tha, jab logon ke paas samvaad kaa koi saadhan nahin tha
 Even then, the helpless people who were victims of the atrocities of the British used to bear all the atrocities silently
 na to koi unki sunne vaala tha or na unke du:khon ko harne vaala
 Even if they used to say to whom and how? Everyone was facing the same torture
 aise main patr-patrikaon kii shuruyaat ne logon ko himmat di, unhen dhanjhas bandhaaya
 This was the reason that every article of the revolutionaries used to communicate new vigor and patriotism in the public
 bhaaratendu kaa naatak ‘bharat-durdasha’ jab prakashit hua tha to logon ko yah anubhav hua tha ki bharat ke log kaise daur se guzar rahe hai or angrejon kii manshaa kya he

 The Navayans are a sect of Buddhism, built by the Indian Buddhist leader Bhimrao Ambedkar
 navyan kaa arth he - "nayaa maarg" yaa "shuddh vaahan"
 All the followers of this Buddhism are "ambedkarite Buddhists", these Buddhists are considered to be compulsory and important to follow the twenty-two vows prescribed by Ambedkar, which Ambedkar gave the conversion ceremony of 14 October 1956
 ambedkar ke in dharm parivarthit buddha anuyaayion ko bharat sarkaar tathaa anya rajya rajya sarkaron ne "navabuddha" naamak sangya de rakhi hai
 The Navayana sects Mahayana, Theravada and Vajrayana etc
 differ in some respects, but in this only the scientific principles and the rational / rational principles are taken with the basic principles of Buddha out of these three sects
 navyan main jatipratha, varnbhed, lingabhed, andhvishwaas tathaa kuritiyon ko koi sthaan nahin hai
 As of 2011, Navyani Buddhists constitute the majority, or 87%, of the total Indian Buddhists
 anya anumaano ke anusaar, bharat main bharat main navayani baudhon kii aabaadi 5 se 7 karod tak hai
 a day before Ambedkar accepted Buddhism, the journalist asked, 'will Buddhist religion or Hinayana Buddhism be the one you adopt?' In reply Ambedkar said, "my Buddhism will neither be Mahayana nor Hinayana, there are some superstitious things in these two sects, so my Buddhism will be Navyaan Buddhism
" jisamen kisi buddha ke mul siddhant or keval vivekwaadi siddhant hi honge, koi bhi kuritiyon yaa andhvishwaas nahin honga
 It will be a 'pure Buddhism'
 ’’ patrkaar ne phir poochhaan, “kya ham ise 'bhimyan' kah sakate hai?” ambedkar ne kaha kii, aap kah sakate hai kintu main nahin kahunga
 Because i don't want to bring myself up like Gautama Buddha
 haalanki bharat ke navayani buddha bodhisattva ambedkar tathaa gautam buddha ko hi sanmaan dete he, kyonki ve ambedkar ko apane aadhyatmik netaa tathaa buddha ko apane guru maanate he
 In present-day India whenever Lord Buddha is remembered, then naturally Bhimrao Ambedkar is also named
 bhartiya swatantraaa ke baad bahut badi sankhya main ek saath dow ambedkar ke netritv main samudayik buddha dhamm parivartan hua tha
 The initiation took place in Nagpur on October 14, 1956, in which 5,00,000 supporters of Ambedkar became Buddhists, the next day 2,00,000 and on the third day on October 16, 300,000 followers became Buddhists in Chandrapur
 is tarah 10 lakh se bhi adhik logon to ambedkar ne keval teen din main buddha banaaya tha
 This event led to the revival or rebirth of Buddhism in India
 ek anumaan ke anusaar march 1959 tak 1
5 se 2 karod log buddha bane the
 Buddhism is one of the major religions of India and informally is the third largest religion in India
 bhagwaan buddha or unka dhamm yah bhartiya buddha anuyaayion kaa dharmagranth hai, jise dow bhimrao ambedkar ne likhaa hai
 Apart from this, Tripitaka and Adi Buddhist texts are considered important by Buddhist followers
 main sweekaar karata hoon or buddha kii shikshaaon kaa paalan karuunga
 i will keep my people away from different opinions of Hinayana and Mahayana, two religious orders
 hamaara buddha dharm ek nayaa buddha dharm, navyan he
 - Press interview on 13 October 1956 at Dr
 Bhimrao Ambedkar, Sham Hotel, Nagpur daliton ko lagane laga he ki hindu dharm se baahar nikalnaa unke liye behatar rasta ho saktaa he kyonki beete saalon main navabaudhon kii haalat sudhari he jabaki hindu daliton kii jindagi vot bank ke rup sangathit hone ke baavjood zyada nahin badali he

 san 2001 kii janaganana ke mutabik desh main baudhon kii jansankhya assi lakh he jinamein se adhikansh buddha yani hindu daliton se dharm badal kar bane hai
 The highest number of Buddhists is 59 lakh in Maharashtra
 uttar pradesh main sirf 3 lakh ke aasapaas navabuddha hai phir bhi kai ilaakon main unhone hindu karmkaandon ko chhod diya he
 The population of Buddhists has increased by 24 percent between 1991 and 2001 across the country
 hindu daliton ke 936 kii tulana main baudhon ke bich mahila or purush kaa ling anupaat 953 prati hajaar he
 This proves that the status of women in Buddhist families is far superior to that of Hindu Dalits
 yah kaaphi buddha samaaj main mahilaon kii ucch sthiti ke anusaar he
 This proportion of Buddhists is higher than that of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Jains
 2001 kii janaganana ke anusaar baudhon ke bich ladakiyon or ladakon kaa ling anupaat 942 he, hindu daliton ke 938 ke mukaable ke anusaar yah adhik hai
 This sex ratio is much higher than Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains
 yah hindu dalit pariwaron ke saath tulana main he ki ladakiyon ko baudhon ke bich behatar dekhbhaal or sangrakshan kaa parinaam hai
 The literacy rate of Buddhist followers is 72
7 percent, which is much higher than Hindu Dalits
 is dar main bhi hinduon, musalamaanon or sikhon kii tulana main kaaphi zyada yah pataa chalata he ki buddha dharm hindu daliton se bhi adhik sakshar hai
 The literacy rate of Buddhist women is 61
7 percent as compared to 41
9 percent of Hindu Dalit women
 yah dar hinduon or musalamaanon kii tulana main bhi adhik he
 This is according to the position of women in Buddhist society
 isse pataa chalata he ki baudhon ke bich mahilaaye hindu dalit mahilaon kii tulana main adhik shikshit ho rahi he
 The rate for Buddhists is the highest at 40
6 percent, compared to 40
4 percent for Hindu Dalits
 yah dar hinduon, musalamaanon isai, sikh kii tulana main bhi adhik he, or jain 
 This proves that Buddhism is more employed than Hindu Dalits
 isse pataa chalata hai kii, shoshiton evam daliton ke netaa dow bhimrao ambedkar ji ne daliton ke utthan yaa pragati ke liye jo mahaan buddhavaad swayan sweekaar kiya tha 
 And others were also advised to accept Buddhism
 or yah daliton ke pida harne main sahi sabit hua hai
 However, today only a small proportion of Dalits have adopted Buddhism, and these Buddhist groups are becoming better and better than Hindu Dalits
 bhartiya baudhon main 95% se adhik navayani buddha hai
 According to the 2011 Bhartiya Jnaganna, there are about 85 lakh 0
7% of 'authorized' Buddhists in India, but according to other surveys and Buddhist scholars, there are 5% to 7% or 6 crore to 8 crore Buddhists in India

 Sir Humphrey Davy tried to separate the metal from alumia soil in 1807, but was not successful
 san 1825 main arsted ne aluminium chloride ko potacium sanras ke saath garam kiya or phir aswan karke paare ko uda diya
 There was a sparkle of metal in the powder that remained after doing this
 yahi dhaatu aluminium kahalaai
 In 1845, Frederick Wöhler used potassium metal as a reducing agent in the preparation of this metal
 use is dhaatu ke kuch chote-chote kan mili, jinaki pariksha karke usne bataaya ki yah nai dhaatu bahut halki he or iske taar khinche ja sakate hai
 Subsequently, in 1854, Devil prepared a good amount of this metal using sodium and sodium aluminum chloride

 Its account is like this: 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles

 The great historian Colonel James Tod has written- "mansingh, the heir of Bhagwan Das, was given the best position in the court of Akbar
 

maansingh ne urisa or assam ko jeet kar unako badshaah akbar ke adheen bana diya
 raja maansingh se bhaybheet ho kar kabul ko bhi akbar kii adheenta sweekaar kerani paddy thi
 As a result of these actions, Mansingh was appointed as the ruler of Bengal, Bihar, South and Kabul
 " When Akbar's general Man Singh Solapur was returning after conquering Maharashtra, Mansingh thought of meeting Pratap
 pratap us vaqt kumbhalgarh main the
 Maharana Pratap had to manage his welcome on the sails of Udaisagar in Udaipur after passing his kingdom within Mewar
 After the reception and mutual interaction, it was time for lunch
 maharaja maansingh bhojan ke liye aaye kintu maharana ko na dekh kar aashcharya main pad gayi
 When he asked Maharana's son Amarsingh for this reason, he told that 'maharana saheb has a headache, so he is unable to support you on food
 ' According to some historians, this incident also became the reason for the battle of Haldi valley
 akbar ko rana pratap ke is vyavhaar ke kaaran mewar par akraman karne kaa ek or mauka mil gaya
 In 1576 AD, he was set on a campaign to punish Maharana Pratapsingh

 It also had Akbar's tremendous artillery with Mughal, Rajput and Pathan warriors

 Rana Pratap fought that huge Mughal army with a handful of soldiers
 haldi ghati kii pili bhoomi raktranjit ho uthi
 On June 21, 1576 AD, seventeen thousand soldiers were killed in this fierce battle of one day between Pratap and the Mughal army in the Haldi valley near Gogunda
 yaheen rana pratap or maansingh kaa aamanaa-saamana hone par donon ke bich vikat yuddh hua - chetak kii peeth par savaar pratap ne akbar ke senapati maansingh ke hathi ke mastak par kaale-nile rang ke, arabi nasl ke ashv chetak ke paanv jamaa die or apane bhaale se sidhaa raja maansingh par ek pralayankari waar kiya, par tatkaal apane hathi ke majboot haude main chipak kar neeche baith jane se is yuddh main unki jaan batch gayi- houdah pratap ke durgharsh waar se buree tarah mud gaya
 Later, when Rana Pratap went away from the battleground of Haldighati on serious injuries, King Mansingh reached his palace and sent one of Pratap's famous elephant elephant Ramprasad to agra-darbar with other loot
 parantu maansingh ne chittorgarh ke nagar ko luutane kii ajna nahin di thi, yah jaan kar badshaah akbar in par kaaphi kupit hua or kuch vaqt ke liye darbar main inke aane par pratibandh tak laga diya
 In the words of James Todd- "in the days when Akbar was horribly ill and feared to die, Mansingh Khusro had laid a web of conspiracies to place him on the Mughal throne
 

uski yah cheshtaa darbar main sab ko gyaat ho gayi or vah bengal kaa shaasha bana kar bhej diya gaya
 After he left Khusro was imprisoned and kept in prison

 He secretly supported Khusro
 Mansingh had an army of twenty thousand Rajputs under his control

 " akbar shashan main jab raja bhagwantdas punjab ke soobedaar niyat hue, tab sindh ke paar seemaant praant kaa shashan unke kunwar maansingh ko diya gaya
 When Akbar's half-brother Mirza Muhammad Hakim died in his 30th year, Mansingh swiftly arrived in Kabul and got the residents there to get rid of the looting that followed the demise of the ruler and his sons Mirza Afrasiyab and Mirza Kankuvad of the kingdom
 He came to the court with other warlords
 akbar ne sindh nadi par kuch din thahar kar kunwar maansingh ko kabul kaa shashankarta niyukt kiya
 They bravely wiped out the robbers who were mercilessly holding the pass of Khyber

 mogul darbar main sammanit ho kar maansingh ne apane rajya kaa vistaar kiya usne anek rajyon par akraman kar ke jo aparimit sampatti luti thi, uske dwaara amer rajya ko shaktishaalee bana diya
 dhaularai ke baad amer, jo ek maamuli rajya samajha jaataa tha, maansingh ke samay vahi ek shaktishaalee or vistrut rajya ho gaya tha
 In the history of India, the Kachhwahs were not considered as knights, but during the time of King Bhagwan Das and Mansingh, the Kachwaha people showed their strength, might and glory from Khutan to the sea
 maansingh yon akbar kii adheenta main zarur tha, par uske saath kaam karne vaali rajput sena, badshaah kii sena se kahin adhik shaktishaalee samajhi jaati thi"
 Some other historians do not agree with this about Colonel James Tod
 His statement is that Mansingh was not the adopted son of Bhagwan Das, but he was the son of Bhagwant Das
 bhagavaandas or bhagwant das donon bhai the
 Mughal-history books reveal that on the orders of Akbar, his experienced officers Maharaja Mansingh, local subedar Qutubuddin Khan and Raja Bhagwant Das of Amer made a lot of research to capture Maharana Pratap in the forests of Gogunda and Mewar but eventually failed Akbar became very angry - even in the year 1577, both of them were 'locked up' diyodhi! " "muslim itihaaskaaron ne likhaa he hijri 1024 san 1615 isvi main maansingh kii bengal main mrityu hui, parantu duusare itihaaskaaron ke vivaran se pataa chalata he ki maansingh uttar kii taraf khilji badshaah se yuddh karne gaya tha jahaan vah san 1617 isvi main maaraa gaya

 bahut se vidyut yaa electronic ghatakon yaa avyavon ko jodakar vidyut paripath banate hai
 There are two types of components that can be added to a circuit: hierarchy and parallelogram
 jis paripath main sabhi ghatak shreneekram main jude hon, use shrenee paripath or jis paripath main sabhi ghatak samanaantar kram main jude hon use samanaantar paripath kaha ja saktaa he
 In the series circuit, the same current flows through each component, while in the parallel circuit, the same voltage is available on each component
 shrenee paripathon main prayek ghatak kaa karyrat rahanaa aavashyak he, anyathaa paripath tut jaayegaa
 The remaining components will continue to function even if any component in the sequence circuits is defective, but the entire circuit may be short-circuited if any component is short-circuited
 yadi kisi paripath main kisi sthaan par 10 om ke pratirodh kii aavashyaktaa he kintu vah uplabdh nahin he kintu 5-5 om ke do pratirodh sulabh hai to inako shreneekram main jodakar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Similarly, if two resistors of 20–20 ohm are available, adding them in parallel, the equivalent resistance of 10 ohm is obtained
 dedh-do volt sahan kar sakane vaale saikadon balbon ko shreneekram main jodakar 230 volt se gharelu bijli se unako jagamagaaya jaataa he
 If 24 volts are needed somewhere, 24 volts can be obtained by connecting two 12 volt batteries in series
 paripathon main bhinn prakaar ke avyav bhi shreneekram yaa samaantarkram main jude ho sakate hai udhaaharan ke liye diod kii raksha ke liye uske shreneekram main upyukt maan kaa fus laga diya jaataa he; yaa pankhe ko chaalu / band karne ke liye uske shreneekram main ek switch daalaa jaataa he
 In the same way, a diode is inserted in its parallel in order to avoid voltage in the reverse direction in an electrolytic capacitor
 kisi sthaan par 2 ampir dhara vahan kar sakane vaala diod lagaana ho to 1 ampear dhara vahan kar sakane vaale do diod samaantarkram main laga dene se bhi kaam chal saktaa he
 When two or more components of electricity are connected in such a way that the same current flows in them, it is called hierarchy
 arthath, shreneekram main jude sabhi avyavon main prayek kshan ek samaan dhara pravaahit hoti he
 However, the potential difference between the ends of those individual components depends on the electrical properties of those components
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi 10 om, 20 om or 50 om ke teen pratirodhon ko shreneekram main joda gaya ho or 10 om vaale pratirodh main 2 ampiore dhara bah rahi ho to 20 om evam 50 om vaale pratirodhon main bhi 2 ampear dhara pravaahit ho rahi hogi
 But the potential of these three resistors will vary
 samaantar kram main jude do yaa adhik 'do siron vaale' vidyut avyavon main sabhi ke siron ke bich vibhavaantar samaan hota he kintu inamen se hokar bahane vaali dhara alag-alag ho sakati he jo un avyavon ke pratirodh, prerakatv, dharita evam anya baton par nirbhar karti he

 So let's read - the best speech ever by Steve Jobs, in Hindi: Steve Jobs convocation speech at Stanford "stay Hungry Stay Foolish" "thank you! Today, when i joined the convocation of one of the world's best universities, Feeling proud aapako ek sach bataa duun main; main kabhi kisi college se paas nahin hua; or aaj pehali baar main kisi college ke snaatak samaaroh ke itnaa kareeb pahunchaa hoon
 Today i would like to tell you three stories of my life


 nothing more but three stories
 meri pehali kahani binduon ko jodne ke bare main he
 i quit my studies within 6 months of joining Reid College, but i kept coming there somehow until 18 months after that
 to sawaal uthta he ki maine college kyon choda? asal main, isaki shuruyaat mere janm se pehle kii he
 My biological mother * was a young, unmarried graduate student, and wanted to give me someone else for adoption
 par unki ek khwaish thi ki koi college kaa snaatak hi mujhe apanaaye kare
 Everything was fine and i was about to be adopted by a lawyer and his wife that suddenly the couple changed their mind and decided they wanted a girl
 isliye tab aadhi-raat ko merehone vaale mata pita,phone karke se poocha gaya, "hamaare paas ek ladkaa he, kya aap use god lenaa chahenge?" or unhone jhat se haan kar di
 Later my mother came to know that my mother is not close to college and father is not even close to high school
 isliye unhone god lene ke kagajaat par hastakshar karne se manaa kar diya; par kuch mahino baad mere hone vaale mata-pita ke mujhe college bhejne ke aashwaasan dene ke ke baad wo maan gayin
 So my life started like this and after seventeen years i went to college
 

 
par galati se maine stenford jitna hi mahangaa college chun liya
 My job occupation started to accumulate in my studies
 6 maheene baad mujhe is padhai main koi mulya nahin dikhaa
 i did not understand what i wanted to do in my life, and how the college would help me in this
 
or upar se main apni mata-pita kii jivan bhar ki kamai kharch karata ja rahaa tha
 So i decided to drop out of college
 

 or sochaa jo hoga acha hoga
 At that time all this was very scary for me, but when i look back, i think it was the best decision of my life
 jaise hi maine college choda mere upar se zaruri kakshaon karne kii baadhyataa khatm ho gayi
 And i just started doing classes of my interest
 ye sab kuch itnaa aasaan nahin tha
 i had no room to stay, so i had to sleep on the floor in a friends room
 main coke kii bottle ko lautaane se milane vaale paison se khaanaa khaataa tha
 

 i used to walk 7 miles every Sunday to Hare Krishna temple, so that i could eat food at least once a week
 yah mujhe kaaphi acha lagata tha
 Whatever i did in my life because of my curiosity and intuition later proved invaluable to me
 yahaan main ek udhaaharan dena chaahoonga
 At that time Reed College was probably the best place in the world where Khushakt * was taught
 puure parisar main har ek poster, har ek label badi khubsuurati se haanthon se sulikhit hota tha
 Since i had dropped out of college, there was no need for me to do normal classes
 maine tay kiya kii main sulekh kii kakshaen karunga or ise acchhee tarah se sikhuunga
 i learned about serif and sans serif type-face; It is also learned how to make beautiful typed shapes by creating spaces and increasing the space between different letter combinations
 yah khubasurat tha, itnaa kalatmak tha ki ise vigyaan dwaara kabja nahin kiya ja saktaa tha, or ye mujhe behad acha lagata tha
 At that time there was no hope that i would ever use these things in my life
 lekin jab das saal baad ham pehla Macintosh computer bana rahe the tab maine ise mike main dizin kar diya
 And Mac became the world's first computer with beautiful typography
 agar maine college se drop out nahin kiya hota to main kabhi mike bahu-tipaphase anupatik rup se sthaan diya gaya phont nahin hote, to shaayad kisi bhi nijee computer main ye chijen nahin hotin
 If i had never dropped out, i would never have done those calligraphy classes and then probably the fonts that are in the personal computer would not have existed
 beshak, jab main college main tha tab bhavishya main dekh kar in binduon kojod kar dekhnaa asambhav tha; lekin das saal baad jab main peeche mud kar dekhtaa hoon to sab kuch bilkul saafe nazar aata he
 You can never add these points by looking into the future
 aap sirf ateet dekhakar hi in binduon ko jod sakate hai; isliye aapako yakeen karnaa hoga kii abhi jo ho rahaa he vah aage chal kar kisi na kisi tarah aapke bhavishya se jud jaayegaa
 You have to believe in something or the other - in your courage, in your destiny, in your life or in your actions


 you have to believe in something
 

 kyonki is baat main vishwaas karte rahanaa kii aage chal kar binduon kojod sakenge jo aapako apane dil kii awaz sunne kii himmat degaa
 

 even when you are walking on a completely different path
 

 or kaha ki fark padegaa
 Bhasa was a famous playwright in Sanskrit literature whose life is not known much
 swapnvasavadatta unke dwaara likhit sabase charchit naatak he jisamen ek raja ke apane rani ke prati avirahaneey prem or punarmilan kii kahani he
 Kalidas, who is considered to be Gupta, has named Bhasa in his play, which suggests that he may have lived before the Gupta period, but this does not provide much concrete evidence of his life
 aaj kai naatakon main unka naam lekhak ke rup main ullikhit he par 1912 main trivendrum main ganpati shastri ne naatakon kii lekhan style main samanta dekhakar unhen bhaas-likhit bataaya
 Earlier, Bhasa's name was forgotten as a Sanskrit playwright
 sanskrit naatakakaron main bhaas kaa naam bade sammaan kaa vishay rahaa he
 Kalidas, referring to his predecessors and popular playwrights, first names Bhasa and later Somil and Kaviputra and calls him a celebrated playwright
 banbhatta, vaakyatiraj or jayadev ne bhi unki prashansa kii he
 The existence of Bhasa's plays is informed by Vamana's "kavyalankar Sutravruti" and Abhinavagupta's "abhinavabharati", Rajasekhar's "kavyamamsa"
 "avantisundari katha" main bhi unka naam aayaa he
 It is, therefore, certain that Bhasa was probably a highly folk artist as a successor to Ashwaghosh and a playwright preceding Kalidasa
 bhaas sanskrit sahitya ke bade naatakkaar ke rup main maanya the parantu unke naatak aprapt the
 In 1907 AD, M
 Ganapathi Shastri received ten Sanskrit plays written in Malayalam script
 khoj karne par teen or naatak mili
 In 1912, he was published by Ganapati Shastri in the name of Bhasa in the Ananthasayan Sanskrit bibliography
 in naatakon kii anek pratiyaan anya sthanon se praapt hui
 Even after the arguments of those who said / did not consider the above 13 plays to be wholly or partially monolithic, Aaj Tak could not be decisive
 is vivaad ke uthne ke anek kaaran hai
 The name of playwright Bhasa is not found anywhere in the setting of plays and in Pushpika
 sanskrit granthon main bhaas ke jo ansh udadhrut hai unamem adhikansh aksharsh: in naatakon main anuplabdh hai
 Similarly, there are several reasons which make the authenticity of the geographical structure of those thirteen plays doubtful
 is prasang ke pramukh matpakshon ko chaar virgo main rakhaa ja saktaa he It is also sometimes said that Bhasa's available plays were incomplete which others or others completed and gave them the present form
 jo ho, yah nishchit he k ye naatak jaali nahin hai
 The Chakar tradition of Kerala has equally protected
 paramparaagat prasiddhi ke anusaar unki sankhya 23 yaa 30 kahi gai he
 The 13 plays of the Trivandrum version have some similarities and characteristics that inform the current version of the playwriting and theatrical artist's unity
 "nandyante tat: pravishati sutaradhar:" se inkaa aarambh, prastaavna ke sthaan par sthapana shabd kaa prayog, naatakkaar ke naam kaa abhaav, bharatvakya main praaia: samya, bharat ke naatyashastreey kuch vidhaanon kaa apaalan, sanskrit main katipay apanineey rup kaa prayog, anek naatakon main kuch paatro ke naam kaa samya, vichaar or adarsh kii samanta, praakrit bhashaa kii kuch vilakshantaa aadi aisi baaten hai jinke kaaran in sab ke ekkartrutv kaa sanket bhi miltaa he
 But whether he was Bhasa or the dramatist of Chakyaar nuts, it cannot be said
 1912 main trivendram se ganpati shastri dwaara prakashit karaae gaye 13 naatak bhaskrut maane jate hai
 Of these, the first eight plays are Ankanki and the last five are Ekanki
 pratham do naatak udayankthashrith hai, 3, 4 sankhyak naatak kalpit kathashrith hai, 5, 6 sankhyak ramakathashrith hai, saptam naatak krishnakthashrith he tathaa ashtum se terahaven tak ke naatakon kaa aadhaar mahabharat he
 In their narratives, the playwright has also used imaginative events, characters, etc
 for dramatization
 pratimanatak saat ankon kaa naatak he, jisamen bhaas ne ram vanagaman se lekar ravanavadh tathaa ram rajbhishek tak kii ghatnaon ko sthaan diya he
 Bharata returning from Nanihal after the death of Maharaj Dasharatha sees the statues of the ancestors at Devakul, en route near Ayodhya, seeing Dasharatha's idol there, he presumes his death
 pratimaa darshan kii ghatana pradhan hone se iskaa naam pratimaa naatak rakhaa gaya he
 Bhasa has its originality in the creation of the statue
 bhaas ne is naatak main moulikta laane main prachlit ramcharita se paryaapt parthaky laa diya he
 Although all these incidents are different from the prevailing narrative, in dramatic terms, their importance is high and these incidents have helped in increasing the curiosity of the reader or the viewer
 is naatak main ramayaniya katha se bhinnataayen is prakaar hai - pratham ank main sita dwaara parihaas main valkal pahananaa bhaas kii moulikta he
 The whole episode of the statue in the third issue is the poet's fantasy and this fantasy is the basis of the play
 paanchaven ank main sita kaa haran bhi yahan naveen dhang se bataaya gaya he
 Here, Ravana comes there only when Rama is present in the mood and asks him to bring Kanchanparashva deer for Shraddha of Dasaratha and removes them by showing Kanchana deer
 yah sampoorn prasang naatakkaar dwaara gadha gaya he
 In the fifth issue, Sumantra's going to the forest and returning to India and telling Sitaharan is a gift of the poet's imagination
 kaikayi dwaara yah kahana bhi ki usne rishivachan satya karne ke liye ram ko van bheja, bhaas kii prasruthi he
 Ultimately, the coronation of Rama in the seventh digit is only fundamental in this drama
 pratimaa naatak bhaas ke sarvottam naatakon main se ek he
 In this seven-point drama, Bhasa's art has attained sufficient heights
 is naatak main bhaas ne paatro kaa charitrik utkarsh dikhaane kaa bharsak prayaas kiya he
 The play has been successful from both chronological and characterization points of view
