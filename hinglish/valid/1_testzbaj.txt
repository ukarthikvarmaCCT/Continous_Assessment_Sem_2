abhi yah siddh karne ke liye paryaapt saboot uplabdh nahin hai ki aspirin sankraman se ladane main madad karti he
 According to recently obtained information, aspirin and its compounds modulate signals via nf-κb
 nf-κb ek transcripshan factor complex he jo shoth sahit kai jaivik prakriyaaon main kendriya bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Aspirin reduces the effects of vasopressin and increases the effects of naloxone after the secretion of ACTH and cartilage by the hypothalamic – pituitary – adrenal axis
 yah kaha gaya he ki aisa antarjanit prastaglandinon or echpie dhuree ko niyantrit karne main unki bhoomika ke bich ek antarkriya ke madhyam se hota he
 Salicylic acid is a mild acid and a very small amount is ionized in the stomach after ingestion
 acetile salicylic acid amashay kii amleey dasha main bahut kam ghulansheel hota he, jisase badi khuraaqon ke avasorana main 8 se 24 ghanton kii der ho sakati he
 In addition to the increased ph of the small intestine, aspirin is rapidly absorbed there due to the greater surface area, causing salicylates to dissolve in greater amounts
 ghulanshiltaa ke vajah se hi adhik maatra main liye jane par aspirin kaa avasorana bahut dhimi gati se hota he or plasma main isaki sandrathaayen iske seven ke baad 24 ghanton tak badhati rah sakati hai
 About 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is associated with protein while the rest is in an active, ionized state
 protein se bandhan sandratha par nirbhar hota he
 The saturation of the binding sites leads to more free salicylate gain and an increase in toxicity

 Half-life is prolonged when large quantities of salicylates are taken because the biotransformation pathways are saturated due to the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide
 chayapachayee margon ke santrupt hone par salicylic acid kaa gurdon dwaara nikaas adhik mahatvapurn ho jaataa he kyonki yah mutr ke piech ke prati atyant samvedansheel hota he
 The excretion from the kidneys increases 10 to 20 times when the ph of urine increases from 5 to 8

 It is known that aspirin interacts with other drugs
 udaa
acitajolamide or ammonium chloride salicylleton ke nashile prabhaavon ko badhaate hai or alcohol bhi is prakaar kii dawaaon ke saath hone vaale jathrantriy raktasrav ko badhaata he
 Aspirin displaces many drugs in the blood from their hostages, including anti-diabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, immunosuppressant methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid, and all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
 carticostirid bhi aspirin kii sandratha ko kam kar sakate hai
 The pharmacological activity of spironolactone can also be reduced by taking aspirin and aspirin competes with penicillin g for secretion from the kidneys
 aspirin vitamin si ke avasorana main bhi baadha daalati he
 Aspirin is used in veterinary medicine, primarily for the treatment of pain and joint inflammation in dogs, although it is not often recommended, as new medicines with less side effects are available for these animals
 udhaaharan ke liye, kutton main salicylleton se sambandhit jathrantriy dushprabhav vishesh taur par hote hai
 Horses are also given aspirin for pain relief, although it is generally not recommended due to its short-term analgesic effect
 ghode bhi jathrantriy dushprabhavon ke prati kaaphi samvedansheel hote hai
 Nevertheless, in most cases of laminitis, its use as an anticoagulant has proved beneficial
 pashuon main aspirin kaa prayog pashuchikitsak ke nirikshan main hi karnaa chaiye
 Aspirin should never be given to cats because they do not have the ability to form glucuronide conjugates, which increases the likelihood of aspirin becoming toxic
 vishaaktata ko khuraaqon ke bich adhik samyaantar rakh kar kam kiya ja saktaa he
 Aspirin is an acetyl compound derived from salicylic acid which is a white, crystal-like, lightly acidic substance with a melting point of 135 ° C
 it happens
 acetile salicylic acid ammonium acitate yaa kshareey dhaatuon ke aceteton, carboneton, citreton yaa hydraxidon ke gholon main teji se vighatit hota he
 Acetyl salicylic acid remains stable in dry air, but when added to humidity is slowly hydrolyzed to acetic and salicylic acids
 kshaaron ke saath gholon main, hydrolysis teji se hoti he or isse praapt saaf ghol puri tarah se acitate or salicyllette yukt ho sakate hai
 Synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction
 salicylic acid main ek amleey yogic, acetic enhydride ko daal kar ek rasaynic pratikriya kii jaati he jisase salicylic acid kaa hydraxil samooh acetile samooh main parivartit ho jaataa he
 This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which are considered to be a by-product of this reaction
 salphurik acid kii laghu matraaen lagbhag hameshaa utprerak ke rup main prayog kii jaati hai
 This method is commonly used in graduate education laboratories
 aspirin kii ucch sandratha vaale formulon se sirke jaisi gandh aati he
 This is because aspirin can hydrolyze and decompose in humid conditions, yielding salicylic acid and acetic acid

 Polymorphism, or the ability of a substance to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical elements
 anek dawaaiyon ko keval ek crystal rup yaa bahurupak ke liye niyantrak anumati mil rahi he
 For a long time only one crystal structure of aspirin was known, although from the 1960s there were indications that aspirin may have a second crystalline form

64 Orchha near Jhansi has its own significance in the history of India
 isse judi tamaam kahaniyaan or kisse pichhali kai dashakon se logon kii jubaan par hai
 Some people say that the first people started living in Bundelkhand
 yahi vajah he ki is ilaake ke har gaanv or shahar ke paas sunaane ko kai kahaniyaan hai
 Two beautiful and interesting places of Bundelkhand are Orchha and Kundar
 bhale hi donon jagahon main kuch kilometre kaa faasla ho, lekin itihaas ke dhaagon se ye donon jagahen behad majbootee se judi hui hai
 Orchha is located about half an hour from Jhansi
 iskaa itihaas 8veen shatabdi se shuru hota he, jab gurjar pratihaar samraat mihir bhoj ne isaki sthapana kii thi
 The first and most interesting story of this place is that of a temple
 darasal, yah mandir bhagwaan ram kii murti ke liye banwaaya gaya tha, lekin murti sthapana ke vakt yah apane sthaan se hili nahin
 This idol was brought from Ayodhya by his queen Ganesh Kuwar during the reign of Madhukar Shah
 chaturbhuj mandir banane se pehle ise kuch samay ke liye mahal main sthapit kiya gaya
 But after the temple was built, no one could move the idol from its place
 ise ishwar kaa chamatkaar maanate hue mahal ko hi mandir kaa rup de diya gaya or iskaa naam rakhaa gaya ram raja mandir
 Today the city is situated around this palace and thousands of devotees gather here on Ram Navami
 vaise, bhagwaan ram ko yahaan bhagwaan maanane ke saath yahaan kaa raja bhi mana jaataa he, kyonki us murti kaa cheharaa mandir kii ore na hokar mahal kii ore he
 There is a garden near the temple in which two very high towers are the center of attraction of the people
 jinhen sawan bhadon kaha jaataa he ki inke neeche bani surangon ko shahi parivaar apane aane-jane ke raste ke taur par istemaal karata tha
 There is a legend about these pillars that according to Hindu calendar in the rainy season, these two pillars were joined at the end of the month of Sawan and the beginning of the month of Bhadon
 haalanki iske bare main pukhta saboot nahin hai
 The paths to the bottom of these minarets have been closed and there is no way of research
 in mandiron ko dashakon puraane pul se paar kar shahar ke bahari ilaake main 'royal anchlev' he
 There are four palaces, Jahangir Mahal, Raj Mahal, Sheesh Mahal and Rai Parveen Mahal built some distance away from them
 inamen se jahangir mahal ke kisse sabase zyada mashhoor hai, jo mughal bundela dosti kaa pratik he
 It is said that Emperor Akbar sent Abul Fazl to control Shahzade Salim, but Salim killed him with the help of Bir Singh
 isse khush hokar saleem ne orchha kii kaman bir singh ko saunp di thi
 By the way, these palaces are evidences of the architecture of the Bundelas
 khule galiyare, pattharon vaali jaali kaa kaam, jaanwaron kii murtiyon, belboote jaisi tamaam bundela vaastushilp kii visheshtaayen yahaan saaf dekhi ja sakati hai
 Now these very cool looking palaces were not like this in their era
 yahaan rojaanaa hone vaali nai halchal se upji kahaniyaan aaj bhi logon kii jubaan par hai
 One of these is the story of Hardaul, which dates back to the reign of Jujhar Singh
 darasal, mughal jasuson kii sajeeshabhari kathaon ke karan is raja kaa shaq ho gaya tha ki uski rani se uske bhai hardaul ke saath sambandh hai
 So he asked the queen to poison Hardaul
 rani ke aisa na kar paane par khud ko nirdosh sabit karne ke liye hardaul ne khud hi jehar pi liya or tyaag kii nai misaal kaayam kii
 With the end of the Bundelaas reign in 1783, Orchha too was lost in the thick forests of oblivion and then it came into the limelight during the freedom struggle
 darasal, swatantraaa senaanee chandrashekhar aaazaad yahaan ke ek gaanv main aakar chhipe the
 Today a memento is also made at his place of stay
 bundelon or mughal shaasha jahangir kii dosti kii yah nishaani orchha kaa mukhya aakarshan he
 There are two bowed elephants at the entrance of the palace
 teen manjila yah mahal jahangir ke swaagat main raja beerasingh dev ne banwaaya tha

 Lord Shri Ram was enthroned 400 years ago in Orchha and since then Lord Shri Ram is worshiped here as a king
 yah puri duniya kaa ekmaatr aisa mandir he jahaan bhagwaan ram ko raja ke rup main puja jaataa he
 There is a fascinating story of Ramraja coming from Orodha to Orchha
 ek din orchha naresh madhukarshah ne apni patni ganeshkunwari se krishna upasna ke iraade se vrundavan chalane ko kaha
 But Rani Ram was a devotee
 unhone vrundavan jane se manaa kar diya
 In anger, the king told him that if you are such a Ram devotee, then go and bring your Ram to Orchha
 rani ne ayodhya pahunchakar sarayu nadi ke kinare lakshmana kile ke paas apni kuti banaakar sadhana aarambh kii
 These days, Saint Shiromani Tulsidas was also practicing meditation in Ayodhya
 sant se aashirwad paakar rani kii aradhana drudh se drudhtar hoti gai
 But the queen did not see Ramaraja for several months
 antat: vah niraash hokar apane praan tyaagane sarayu kii majdhaar main kud paddy
 Here he saw Ramaraja in the deep depths of water
 rani ne unhen apana mantavya bataaya
 Ramraja agreed to walk to Orchha but he kept three conditions - first, this journey will be on foot, second - the journey will be only in the flower constellation, third - the statue of Ramaraja will not rise again from the place where it will be kept
 rani ne raja ko sandesh bheja ki wo ramraaja ko lekar orchha aa raheen hai
 King Madhukarshah built the Chaturbhuj Temple at a cost of crores to establish the Deity of Ramaraja
 jab rani orchha pahunchi to unhone yah murti apane mahal main rakh di
 It was decided that the statue would be consecrated by placing the idol in the auspicious idol in the Chaturbhuj temple
 lekin ram ke is vigrah ne chaturbhuj jane se manaa kar diya
 It is said that Ram came here as a child and leaving his mother's palace, how could he go to the temple
 ram aaj bhi isi mahal main virajman hai or unke liye bana karodon kaa chaturbhuj mandir aaj bhi viraan pada he
 This temple is still idolless
 yah bhi ek sanyog he ki jis samvath 1631 ko ramraaja kaa orchha main aagaman hua, usee din ramcharita maanas kaa lekhan bhi purna hua
 The idol present in Orchha is told that when Ram was going to exile, he gave one of his child idols to mother Kaushalya
 maa kaushalya usee ko bal bhoga lagaaya karti thim
 When Ram returned to Ayodhya, Kaushalya immersed this idol in the Saryu River
 yahi murti ganeshkunwari ko sarayu kii majdhaar main mili thi
 It is the only temple in the world where Rama is worshiped as a king and he is given a salute before sunrise and after sunset
 yahaan ram orchhadhish ke rup main maanya hai
 There are temples of Hanuman ji all around the Ramaraja temple
 chhadadari hanuman, bajariya ke hanuman, lanka hanuman ke mandir ek suraksha chakra ke rup main chaaron taraf hai

 Venom is an American superhero film based on a character of the same name from Marvel Comics, produced by Columbia Pictures in association with Marvel Entertainment, and distributed by Sony Pictures

 venum main, patrkaar edi brock ek alian simbiot se jud jaataa he, jo use mahashakti detaa he, tathaa khalanaayak venum main parivartit kar detaa he
 Development of a film based on Venom first began in 2007 with producer Avi Arad as a spin-off of the spider-man film franchise

 While exploring space in search of a new habitable planet, a vehicle of the Life Foundation, a bioengineering organization, discovers a comet on which symbiotic creatures live
 yaan ke vaigyanik is simbiot ke chaar namoonay lekar prithvi ke liye waapas nikalate hai, lekin un chaaron main se ek bhaag nikalataa he or unhen le ja rahe yaan ko malaysia main durghatnagrast kar detaa he
 The Life Foundation succeeds in retrieving the other three, and brings them to their research campus in San Francisco, where the Foundation's CEO, Carlton Drake, discovers that the symbiote does not survive without a breath-taking host , And these hosts often reject this process of symbiosis
 antariksh ke kshetra main unke kaam ke bare main drek kaa saakshaatkaar lene ke liye niyukt patrkaar edi brock ek vargeekrut dastavej dikhaa detaa he, jo ki foundation kii vakil, or uski mangetar eni veeing ko ek mukademe main life foundation kii raksha karne ke liye diya gaya tha
 Based on the documents, Brock questions Drake about his trials on humans, which results in both Brock and Weing losing their jobs
 is ghatana ke baad veeing unke rishte ko vahiin samaapt kar detii he
 Six months later, Drake is getting closer to achieving successful symbiosis
 drek ke vaigyanikon main se ek, doraa scarth brock se sampark karti he; scarth drek ke tareekon se asahmat hai or use benakaab karne main brock kii madad karnaa chaahati he
 She helps Brock sneak into the research complex to find evidence, where she discovers that one of her acquaintances: a homeless woman named Maria, is one of Drake's test subjects
 brock maaria ko bachaane kaa prayaas karata he, lekin simbiot ke prabhaav main vah brock par hamalaa kar detii he, or is prakriya main simbiot brock ke sharir main sthanantarit ho jaataa he, jabaki maaria kii mrityu ho jaati he
 Brock escapes from the premises, but he soon begins to display strange symptoms, and approaches Weing for help
 veing kaa nayaa premi, dow dan louis, brock kii jaanch karata he, or uske sharir main simbiot ke hone kii khoj karata he
 Meanwhile, in a crime of betraying him, Drake leaves the last surviving symbiote to Scarth, who eventually dies
 iske falswaroop brock ke andar bachaa simbiot apni prajati kaa ekmaatr gyaat jivit namoona batch jaataa he
 Drake sends the goons to retrieve the symbiote from Brock, but the symbiote dominates Brock's body, and transforms him into a demonic creature, who fights all those goons
 shahar ke baahar aashray lene ke baad, simbiot brock se baat karata he, or apana naam venum bataata he
 It also tells Brock that the comet is an invasion force, looking for a new world where symbiotes can capture and eat the inhabitants
 iske baad venum simbiots ke is lakshya kii prapti main madad karne par brock ko jivit chhodane kii peshkash karata he, or brock jald hi un sabhi superhuman visheshtaon kaa anand lene lagata he, jo use simbiot se praapt hui hai
 Brock sneaks into his old workplace to turn over the evidence of Drake's crimes, but on his exit he is surrounded by SWAT officials, and transforms into Venom once again to escape them
 veing is parivartan ko dekh leti he, or brock ko louis ke karyaalay main le jaati he, jahaan ve brock ko dikhaate hai ki kaise simbiot dhire-dhire uske aantarik angon ko kharaab kar rahaa he
 Although the symbiote claims that it is part of his symbiosis, Brock uses an MRI machine to weaken the symbiote until they are both separated
 venum se alag ho jane par sheeghra hi drek ke gunde use pakad lete hai
 Meanwhile, the fourth symbiote, the ryot, passes from one body to another, reaching Malaysia from San Francisco
 yah drek ke saath simbiosis kar letaa he, jo badale main baaki simbiots ikattha karne or unhen prithvi par laane ke liye life foundation kaa ek antariksh yaan rit ko dene ke liye sahamat hai
 Weying reluctantly symbiosis with Venom to free Brock from Drake's goons
 jab brock or venum phir se ek hote hai, to venum kahata he ki brock ke saath pehle hui baatcheet ne use prithvi kii raksha karne main madad karne ke liye aashwast kr diya he, or phir donon veeing kii madad se rit or drek ko rokane ke liye nikal padate hai
 Venom succeeds in stopping Yan, which then explodes, causing both Raitt and Drake to die
 veing kaa maananaa he ki brock ab venum se bandhaa nahin he, or visphot main venum kii bhi mrityu ho gai, haalanki ve donon gupt rup se bandhe rahete hai or aparaadhiyon kii hatya karke shahar kii raksha ke safar pe nikal padate hai
 Brock reverts to his business of journalism, and in the mid-credits scene he is invited to interview the killer Cletus Kasady
 iske atirikt jeni slate, woodi harrelson, sope aluko, scot dekirt, marsela bragio, mishael lee, mike brant, chrishchiyan converi or sam madina ko bhi agyaat bhoomikaaon main shaamil kiya gaya he
 Marvel Comics character Eddie Brock, a notable rival of spider-man, first appeared in the 2007 film spider-man 3, where he was played by actor Topher Grace
 gres kii bhoomika shuruyaat main behad maamuli si likhi gayi thi, jisamen uske upnaam, venum kaa ullekh tak nahin tha, lekin baad main ise ek pramukh khalanaayak bhoomika main badal diya gaya, kyonki nirmaataa avi arad ne mahasoos kiya ki spidar-main shrunkhlaa nirdeshak sam raimi ke vyaktigat pasandida khalnaayakon par bahut adhik nirbhar thi, bajaay un paatro ke, jinamein aadhunik prashansak adhik ruchi rakhte the
 Raimi, on the other hand, was hesitant to use it due to the character's alleged "lack of humanity"
 july 2007 main arad ne venum par kendrit ek spin-of film banane kii apni yojanaon kaa khulaasa kar diya
 As of July 2008, Sony was actively developing Venom, along with direct sequels to spider-man 3, in the hopes that it could add "longevity" to the spider-man franchise, exactly as twenty-first Century Fox's X- Like the character Wolverine from Maine films
 studio ne jaikab estes kii ek script se shuruuaat kii, lekin phir apane vichaar badalte hue film ko unke masaude se alag disha main le jane kaa nirnay kiya, or nae lekhakon kii talash shuru kii
 Sony was also skeptical about whether Grace alone could handle an entire film on her shoulders
 usee varsh sitambar main venum ke sah-nirmaataa tod mcfarlen ne soni ko suzav diya ki ek khalanaayak ko mukhya charitra ke rup main rakhane ke kaaran venum film pradarshan nahin kar paaegi
 In response, Sony hired Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese to write a new screenplay, while several industry insiders suggested to Sony that Grace should return for the spin-off
 varnik or reez ne film ke liye soni ko ek mul kahani sunai, jise reez ne yathartwaadee, sidhi-saadi, or charitra ko thodaa nindy rakhane vaali kahani ke rup main varnit kiya tha
 The couple worked on an allegory with Sony and Marvel, who "had specific rules about villains, their historical background, and other things of that sort"
 april 2009 tak varnik or reez ne ek masauda puraa kar liya tha, jisamen vishesh rup se sten lee ke liye likhi gayi ek bhoomika shaamil thi, or ek anukram dikhaaya gaya tha, jisamen venum simbiot puure shahar main "ek sharir se duusare sharir main kudata rahata he, or prayek vyakti jiske andar yah ja rahaa he, vastav main hinsak ho rahaa he or kisi duusare par akraman kar rahaa he, tab tak, jab tak yah use chhodkar aage nahin bad jaataa
 " He was a journalist
 He had the wrong story, he got in trouble for it 


 the whole essence to us for the Marvel characters: stay close to the bible, stay close to the emotional story, and the rest is fun
 Wernick and Reese had also completed their second draft by September 2009, and Reese stated that Sony was "looking to move in some way"
 ek maheene baad gairi ross ko, jo us samay spidar-main 4 ke liye patakatha likh rahe the, venum kii patakatha ko phir se likhane ke saath-saath use nirdeshit karne, or arad ke saath saath nirmaan karne kaa kaam saunpa gaya

 janak videh ke ullekh shatapath brahman main chaar bhinn bhinn sthalon main hue hai or sabhi main yajyavlky bhi saath-saath aate hai
 There Janaka Videha is found teaching Yajnavalkya
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki ve ant main swayan brahmanya pad praapt kar lete hai
 In this way, in the Vedic era, the transformation was not only possible but also prevalent; It is difficult to say whether Janaka mentions leaving the Kshatriya Varna and entering the Brahmin Varna, or is there a direction towards attaining Brahmanism only in the field of knowledge and philosophy
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki agnihotra ke bare main uchit uttar paakar janak ne yajyavlky ko 100 gaayon kaa daan diya
 Donation of 1000 cows is also said at another site
 shakhayan shrautasutra main unhen 'saptaraatr' naamak yajna kaa karta bhi kaha gaya he
 Janaka and Yajnavalkya are also mentioned in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, but there Yajnavalkya leaves discipleship and attains the position of Guru and Janaka himself learns about the hereafter, Brahma and Atma
 shatapath brahman, brihadaaranyak or kaushitaki upanishdon tathaa shankhayan aaranyak se yah to siddh hota hi he ki janak videh or yajyavlky samakaleen the, yah bhi gyaat hota he ki shwethaketu aaruneya or kaashi ke prasiddh darshanik raja ajatshatru bhi unheen ke samay main hue the

 Therefore, Janak also has to believe before that era, but his exact time cannot be successfully determined

 ek divasiy antarrashtriya match main kshetra main baadha daalane ke liye padchyut hone vaale ve akele bhartiya hai
 Mohinder Amarnath is known for his great performance in World Cup cricket
 unhen final or semifinal match main "main of da match' ke khitaab se sammanit kiya gaya tha or is tarah se unhone bharat kaa apane pehle ek divasiy antarrashtriya khitaab ke liye netritv kiya
 With his precise and fast bowling in the semi-final against England, he took the wickets of top-order batsmen like David Gover and Mike Gatting
 unhone ausatan 2
25 over prati over ke anusaar apane 12 overon main maatr 27 ran die, yah sabhi bhartiya gendbaajon dwaara die gaye ranon main sabase kam the
 Speaking of batting, he gave India a solid start by scoring 46 runs
 unhen main of da match banaaya gaya
 India batted first against the West Indies in the final which controversially boasts the best bowling in the world
 team acha pradarshan nahin kar pai,54
4 overon pe 183 ran bana kar sari team out ho gayi or nirdhaarit 60 over bhi puure nahin khel pai
 Amarnath's calm and neutral batting against West Indies fast bowling gave the Indian innings some stability, of which he remained the longest batsman of all Indian batsmen
 ve sabase lambey samay tak krij par bane rahe or unhone 26 ran banaae
 Although it may not be a good thing to hold on to the crease for a long time in a limited overs match, given that India had not played the entire 60 overs, Amarnath's innings brought the other batsman to score
 Gave a chance to make
 kris shrikant ne sarvaadhik 38 ran banaaye, or sandip patil or amarnath kramshah duusare or tisare number par rahe
 After a poor batting performance, India's chances of winning were thought to be almost non-existent
 haalanki bhartiya gendbaaji ne mausam or pich kii sthiti kaa bharpoor phayda uthaate hue west indies kii team ko 140 ranon par out kar diya or is prakaar 43 ran se final match jeet liya
 Amarnath and Madanlal were jointly the highest wicket-takers, taking 3 wickets each
 semifinal kii tarah hi final match main bhi amarnath ek baar phir sabase kifayati gendbaaj rahe, prati over 1
71 ranon ke ausat se unhone apane 7 overon main keval 12 ran die
 Again, like the semi-finals, Amarnath was declared man of the match
 amarnath apane vyaktitv, saahas or drudh sankalp ke liye jane jate hai
 West Indian legend Vivian Richards called him "one of the best men to have played cricket" and former Australian Test match opener David Boon said "losing is probably not in his dictionary"
 da age main gidon hegg ne likhaa he kii,"aise samay main jab gendbaajon par tej gendbaaji karne par or bounsar phenkane par koi pabandi nahin thi, ve gend ko hook karne se kabhi ghabaraae nahin - yadhyapi aisa karne ke liye unke paas kai kaaran the

 Michael Holding has stated, "his ability to withstand his pain sets him apart from others
 

" ek tej gendbaaj jaanata he jab ek ballebaaj dard jhel rahaa hota he
 But Jimmy used to stand up and continue the game
 ' " During India's tour of the West Indies at the Bridgetown Test in 1982–83, Amarnath had to leave the game midway to get the stitches after an injury to his head
 khel main lautne ke baad, unhen cricket ke itihaas ke sabase ghaatak tej gendbaaj maaikel holding kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 yah tay tha ki holding bounsar maar kar apni gendbaaji se amarnath ko bhaybheet karne kii koshish karegaa or vastav main usne vaisaa hi kiya
 While most people expected that in such a situation a batsman would take the next step and bow down to Vivek, but Amarnath stood and hooked the ball and brought it across the boundary line
 However, during the 1983–1984 tour, the West Indies bowling attack took the most lethal vengeance from Amarnath and allowed him to take just one run in six innings, during which Holding forced him to be dismissed for zero three times
 amarnath bhartiya cricket ke rajnatik sansthapanon ke saath apane dwandv ke liye mashhoor the, or ve chayankartaaon ko " jokaron kaa samooh" kehane ke liye prasidd hai
 Due to this, he was also removed from the Indian team many times

 chunki dhan raashi hameshaa carddharak ke checking khate se aegi, isiilie bikri ke samay "credit" or "debit" kaa fark to jarur hi hoga
 The transaction process is "offline" when the cardholder chooses "credit"
 bikri ke samay, koi vyapaaree anugna praapt karne ke liye card ko sansaadhit kar saktaa he yaa nahin bhi kar saktaa he
 a license is a guarantee through which the merchant will be paid the amount
 In a normal credit card transaction, the amount is not withdrawn from the cardholder's account until the merchant has settled all the transactions on his or her credit card, after which the cardholder's checking account is asked for payment against the purchase amount
 is
 charge kii gayi raashi carddharak ke khate main bhejne main kitne dinon kaa samay lag jaae, yah vyapaaree par nirbhar karata he
 The transaction process is "online" when the cardholder selects "debit"
 bikri ke samay, carddharak khariddaari ko apane "pin" se pramanit karata he, rakam kii jaanch ho jaati he or jab manjuuri mil jaati he to turant carddharak ke checking khate se vyapaaree ke khate main rakam sthanantarit ho jaati he
 Most US consumers are indifferent to credit versus debit, while there are significant differences and they should all be aware of this
 sabase jaruri baat yah he ki kinhin paristhitiyon main credit ke taur par hui lenden kii prakriya vivaadit ho sakati he, phir chaahe vah debit card ho yaa phir credit
 ek debit card ko lekar jis tarah ke vivaad hote hai, credit card ko lekar bhi usee tarah ke vivaad ho sakate hai: carddharak ke paksh main jab tak vivaad sulajh nahin jaataa he, charge khate main usee tarah rah jaataa he
 For a debit card holder, this means that he stays away from the money until the dispute is resolved in his favor and the amount is paid back to him
 However, a credit card holder, if he has not already paid the disputed balance, does not have to do so until the matter is resolved
 agar uske paksh main maamla sulajh jaataa he, tabhi vivaadit charge uske khate se kaat liya jayega, yaa agar usne pehle se hi vivaadit raashi kaa bhugtan kar diya he to vah raashi use phir se lautaa di jaaegi
 baharhaal, kul milakar, debit ke rup main lenden kii prakriya main badi vishmata he, jo dhokhadhadi ko chhodkar duusari kisi bhi paristhiti main vivaadit nahin ho saktaa he
 Another difference in choosing a debit or credit card is that when a transaction is made through a debit card, then it also adds a fee
 bahut saare bank apane debit card or checking khate ke saath puraskaar package kii bhi peshkash karte hai
 These prize packages are usually in the form of points, such as x amount of dollars spent, you get x amount points, which are paid at any time for cash back, music, coffee, airline miles, etc
 Is worthy to be known
 haalanki ye puraskaar keval tabhi jode jate hai jab koi credit kaa chunaav debit card ke lenden main karata he

 maujuuda samay main debit card kii lenden prakriya teen tarah se hoti he: online debit, ofline debit or electronic purse card system 
 dhyaan dene kii baat yah he ki ek bhautik card main online debit card, ofline debit card or electronic purse card ke kaary shaamil hai
 While many debit cards are of the Visa card or mastercard brand, there are also a variety of debit cards, all of which are only acceptable in a particular country or region, for example, Switch and Solo Unite in the Kingdom, Interac Canada , Carte Blue in France, Laser in Ireland, EC Electronic Check in Germany and EFTPOS cards in Australia and New Zealand
 The need for cross-border compatibility and the recent arrival of the euro has led to the network of many of these cards being re-branded with the international identity Mystro logo, which is the master card brand

 Overall, online debit is considered to be far superior to offline debit cards due to its secure licensing method and live status, which only in the case of online debit cards diagnoses problems with processing delay on transactions
 ofline debit cardon main pramukh credit cardon yaa pramukh debit cardon kaa logo hota he or bikri ke samay credit cart kii tarah iskaa istemaal hota he
 Such debit cards may have a daily limit and / or a maximum limit equal to the current / checking account balance from which the funds are withdrawn
 ofline debit card se kiye gaye lenden main upyogkarta ke shesh khate main iskaa prabhaav dikhne main 2-3 din lag jaataa he
 In some countries and some banks and merchant service organizations, "credit" or offline debit transactions take place beyond face value without the buyer's cost, while a small fee may be asked for "debit" or online debit transactions
 Other differences are that the debit buyer can withdraw cash in addition to the amount of the debit purchase, from the merchant's point of view, the merchant pays a smaller amount on online debit transactions than on "credit" debit transactions

 An additional problem with the use of debit cards in the US is their voluntary use in gas pumps
 graahak debit card par eendhan khareednaa chaah saktaa he, lekin pump computer nahin jaanata he ki graahak ko kitna eendhan chahie
 The pump is activated when the customer presents his card on the card reader and inserts a PIN
 isi bindu par pump eendhan daalata he, haalanki bikri kaa lenden puraa nahin hota he
 There is no way to know how much fuel was sold at the pump, nor how much money is available in the customer's debit account

 At the volunteer fuel pump, the fuel reaches the customer's tank already, then the bank is able to know the total cost of the sale
 yahaan is samasya ke kai samaadhaan hai, jaise ki jab khate main 10 dollar se kam rakam he to 1 dollar kii purv anujyapti nakaar diya jaataa he, lekin phir bhi ek khaas rakam ke lenden kii anumati milti he, lekin bikri ke evaj main lenden se pehle vyapaarik maal kaa vitaran kar dena debit card pranali ke liye vipatti he

 The details of the debit card say, for medical use only, are invalid for various reasons: the merchant and the issuing bank have no way other than to decide as soon as possible whether the entire purchase is eligible for the customer's tax benefit type ; No way for customers to know as soon as possible; Often he makes a mixed purchase with need and convenience and can easily make mistakes; The additional contractual clause between the customer and the issuing banks would alter the payment processing standards, creating additional confusion

 Cabinet members are expected to work jointly

 Given that women show a significant variation in their diabetes response to this medical disorder, it is surprising that the disease effect on sexual arousal is also not excessive

 Although the way in which female sexual arousal disorder and female orgasmic disorder are expressed suggests a wide degree of change, different treatment strategies should be used if none of the different factors contribute to the two disorders
 In fact, generally the same treatment strategies are applied for both disorders

 Because the relationship between the woman and her partner has been shown to play an important role in both the development and maintenance of sexual problems, most programs are designed to be implemented by the couple, although additional personal strategies focus on Can

 In this sense, it is the fourteenth largest city in the United States by area
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles 
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960
 The city is located in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 ° C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 ° f warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 °F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 °F, with overnight lows of 63 °F 
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 °F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 °F and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 ° f and 73 ° f in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 ° f in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 ° f in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 ° f on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 ° f on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical coral tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the bird of paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 Vishnu has been recognized as the supreme power and control of the entire world since Vedic times
 hindu dharm ke aadharbhoot granthon main bahumanya purananusaar vishnu parameshwar ke teen mukhya roopon main se ek rup hai
 In the Puranas, Trimurti Vishnu has been called the follower of the world
 trimurti ke anya do rup brahma or shiv ko mana jaataa he
 While Brahma is considered the creator of the world, Shiva is considered the destroyer
 multah vishnu or shiv tathaa brahma bhi ek hi hai yah manyata bhi bahushah sweekrut rahi he
 Vishnu has been recognized as one who incarnates in various forms to guide justice, destruction of injustice, and guide the organism to follow the path appropriately

 He holds the Padma in his lower left hand, the mace in his lower right hand, the conch in his upper left hand and the chakra in his upper right hand
 'vishnu' shabd kii vyutpatti mukhyatah 'vish' dhaatu se hi maani gayi he
 In Nirukta, Yaskacharya has taken the word 'vishnu' in the sense of 'vyapati', and termed it as 'vishnu'
 vaikalpik rup se 'vish' dhaatu ko bhi 'pravesh' ke arth main liya gaya he, 'kyonki vah vibhu hone se sarvatra pravesh kiya hua hota he
 Adi Shankaracharya has also considered the meaning of the word 'vishnu' broadly in his Vishnusahsrnama-bhasya, and has clearly written as its etymology that "vishu, the epithet of vyasth meaning, becomes 'vishnu' in the form of metal" Vishnu " 
 'vish' dhaatu ko unhone bhi vikalp se hi liya he or likhaa he ki "athwa nuk pratyyant 'vish' dhaatu kaa rup vishnu he; jaisaa ki vishnupurana main kaha he-- 'us mahatma kii shakti is sampoorn vishwa main pravesh kiye hue hai; isliye vah vishnu kehalaata he, kyonki 'vish' dhaatu kaa arth pravesh karnaa he"
 Major commentators of the Rigveda have also broadened the meaning of the word 'vishnu' with one voice
 vishnusukt kii vyakhya main acharya sayan 'vishnu' kaa arth vyapnsheel tathaa sarvavyaapak karte hai; to shripad damodar satavlekar bhi iskaa arth vyapaktaa se sambaddh hi lete hai
 Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati has also taken the meaning of 'vishnu' omnipresent universally and has also taken the meaning of supreme scholar in many places
 is prakaar suspasht parilakshith hota he ki 'vishnu' shabd 'vish' dhaatu se nishpann he or uskaa arth vyapanyukt he
 In the Vedic Dev-tradition, Vishnu's place is secondary to the numerical point of view of the Suktas because his eulogy is performed in only 5 Suktas; But if they are not looked at from a numerical point of view and consider them from other aspects, then their importance comes out very high
 rugveda main unhen 'brihachharir', yuvakumar aadi visheshnon se khyapit kiya gaya he
 The nature and characteristics of Vishnu mentioned in the Rigveda can be observed in the following points: - vishnu kii anupam visheshta unke teen paad-prakshep hai, jinka rugveda main baarah baar ullekh miltaa he
 Probably this is his biggest feature
 unke teen pad-kram madhu se paripurna kahe gayi hai, jo kabhi bhi ksheen nahin hote
 His three rankings are so elaborate that entire folk exist in them
 ‘tredha vichkramanh’ bhi prakaaraantar se unke teen paad-prakshepon ko dhvanit karata he
 The terms 'uruguay' and 'urukram' are also reflective of the said fact
 madhu se aapurit unke teen pad-kram main se do drushtigochar hai, teesraa sarvatha agochar
 This third highest position has been called the flight of birds and beyond the mortal eye
 yask ke purvavarti shakpuni in teen paad-prakshepon ko brahmand ke teen bhaagon-- prithvi, antariksh or dhuloak main surya kii sanchaar gati ke pratik maanate hai
 Yasak's predecessor Aurnavabha considers him to be the covenant of the rising of the sun, the position in the mid-day and the setting
 tilak mahoday inase varsh ke tridhavibhaajan kaa sanket maanate hai
 If seen, most scholars consider Vishnu to be a sun-vachhi, one of his footprints from midday till midday, second footfall from midnight to midnight and third footfall from postwar to posthumous rise
 inhen purvokt do paad-prakshepon ko drushtigochar or tisare ko agochar kaha gaya he
 But many scholars including mcdanal also say that in this sense how can the third stage be considered as 'supreme'? Therefore, they, like the aforesaid Shakpuni, consider the three steps to be the path through the three worlds of the solar deity
 surya kii kalpana kaa hi samarthan karte hue mcdanal ne vishnu dwaara apane 90 ashwon ke sanchalit kiye jane kaa ullekh kiya he, jinamein se pratye ke chaar-chaar naam hai
 Thus 90 multiplied by 4 numbers means 360 horse, which they consider to be integral since the days of a solar year
 vastutah vishnu ke do padon se sampoorn vishwa kii niyantranaatmakataa tathaa tisare pad se unka param dham arthath unki prapti sanketit he
 In the Rigveda itself, these three verses have been given a mysterious explanation
 isliye is pad ko gyanatmak maanakar rugveda main hi spasht kaha gaya he ki vishnu kaa param pad gyaniyon dwaara hi gyatavya he
 Though Vishnu is also considered to be a resident of Vani, but his most beloved abode, 'pathah' is well-known in the Rigveda
 acharya sayan ne ‘giri’ pad ko shlisht maanakar uskaa arth 'vaani' ke saath-saath lakshanik rup main ‘parvat ke samaan unnat lok’ bhi kiya he
 If 'giri' is accepted in both these ways, then the problem is solved
 vishnu kaa teesraa pad jahaan pahunchataa he vahi unka awaas sthaan he
 The world of Vishnu is the 'ultimate post', that is, it is the best form of destination
 us ‘param pad’ kii visheshta yah he ki vah atyadhik prakaash se yukt he
 There cows with many horns transmit there
 ‘gaavah’ yahan shlisht pad kii tarah he
 The meaning of the physical confirmation of milk, etc
, when there is 'cow' meaning from the pun and 'rays', there is a lot of light that is easily permissible for light, that is, spiritual progress
 vishnu ke ‘param pad’ main madhu kaa sthaayee utsa he
 This 'madhu' is also rejoicing to the gods
 is shlisht pad kaa jo bhi arth kiya jaay par vah har sthiti main parmanand kaa vaachak he, jiske liye devtaa sahit samast praani abhilaashi bhi rahete hai or prayatnsheel bhi
 Therefore, everyone wishes for the attainment of the said world
 usee mantra main vahaan punyashalee logon kaa, tripti kaa anubhav karte hue ullekh bhi hua he
 a prominent feature of Vishnu is his friendship with Indra
 indra ke saahchary main hi unke teen paad-prakshepon kaa pravartan hota he
 Together with Indra, he destroys the 99 forts of the Shambar monster
 isi prakaar vah vrutra ke saath sangram main bhi indra kii sahaayta karte hai
 Both have also been described with some other powers
 is prakaar vishnu dwaara sompaan kiya janaa or indra dwaara teen paad-prakshep kiya janaa bhi varnit he
 In the Rigveda, Mandal 6, Sukta 69, there is a homage to the two deities
 isi prakaar rugveda ke mandal 5, sookt 87 main indra ke sahchar marudganon ke saath unki sahastuti praapt hoti he
 The word Vishnu derived from Vishnu Dhatu literally means 'broad, dynamic, functional or enterprising'
 apane bal-vikram ke hi kaaran ve logon dwaara stut hote hai
 They are eternal semen
 is gun ke kaaran hi unhen pratik rup se ‘vrishna’ bhi mana gaya he
 They are the cause of fear of enemies due to their semen or heroic deeds
 unase log usee prakaar bhaybheet rahete hai, jis prakaar kisi parvatachaari singh se
 With the utterances of 'parameshvaradbhiti', etc
, it is proved to fear the common people
 unase bhaybheet hona akaaran nahin he
 They are about to commit acts of violence etc
 yahan yah dhyatavya he ki ve kutsit hinsadikarta kaa hi vadh karte he
 Therefore it has been said for them that they are not murderers
 vishnu visteern, vyapak or apratihat gati vaale hai
 The terms 'urugay' and 'urukram' are a source of this fact
 ‘urugay’ kaa arth acharya sayan dwaara ‘mahjjanon dwaara stuyaman’ athwa ‘prabhutatya stuyaman’ karne se bhi vishnu kii mahima vikhandit nahin hoti
 Dr
 Yadunandan Mishra says that we are urged to make the meaning of this term 'with a wide speed', because it has been said to be a 'transmitter in all worlds'
 unke pad-kram itane sudeergh hote hai ki ve apane teen paad-prakshepon se hi teenon lokon ko naap lete hai
 If Vishnu's three verses are created, established, and worn, then he also nurtures dependent people there
 logon ko apana bhogy annadi unheen teen pad-kramon ke prasadswarup praapt hota he, jisase ki ve param tripti kaa anubhav kiya karte hai
 Those who praise Vishnu, they always do well, because their eulogy gives them complete energy
 is prakaar sphurti-pradaayini stuti vishnu tak pahunchaa paane ke liye sabhi lalayit rahete hai
