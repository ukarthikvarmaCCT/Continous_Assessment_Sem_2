 This action takes place in several stages and acts as a circle
 is chakra kaa adhyayan sarvapratham hans adolf creb ne kiya tha, unheen ke naam par is kriya ko crebs chakra kehete hai
 The first action of this action is citric acid, so this process is also called citric acid cycle
 citric amla main 3 carboxylic mulak upasthit rahata he atah ise tri carboxylic cycle yaa tisie chakra bhi kehete hai
 In the cyclic reactions of the Krebs cycle, complete oxidation of pyruvic acid gives out one molecule of carbon dioxide at three places throughout the cycle, that is, three carbon atoms of pyruvic acid leave three molecules as carbon dioxide
 shwasan kriya ke creb chakra ke dauraan pyruvik amla oxeloacetic amla se kriya karata he
 It consists of three co-enzymes
 sarvapratham piruvik amla injim kii upasthiti main oxykrut hokar carbon dioxide tathaa hydrogen main badal jaataa he

 The organisms that have this respiration are called Nairobes
 oxic shwasan ke samaan hi anaksi shwasan ke prarambh main glicolisis kii kriya hoti he jiske ant main piruvik amla banataa he
 In the further process, there is no complete oxidation of pyruvic acid due to lack of oxygen, so this respiration produces much less energy than oxygen respiration
 paudhon main yah piruvik amla carboxillej injim kii upasthiti main acitaldihide or carbon daai oxide main badal jaati he
 This is then degraded by NADH2 in the presence of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, and is converted to NAD and ethyl alcohol

 shwasan kii kriya main carbon daai-oxide kaa vah aaytan jo baahar nikalataa he tathaa jitna aaytan oxigen kaa avasorana hota he uske anupaat ko shwasan bhagfal kehete hai
 It is always represented in numbers such as - 6CO2 / 6O2 = 1 Respiratory quotient indicates which type of food is being oxidized in respiration, as this ratio is different in different foods
 shwasan kii kriya main upyog main aane vaale khadyapadaarthon ke aadhaar par iskaa maan ikai, ikai se kam, ikai se adhik hota he
 When the food substance that is oxidized to respiration is carbohydrate, then the value of the respiratory quotient is unit, such as in seeds of germinated wheat
 jab shwasan main upyog hone vaala khadyapadaarth vasa yaa protein ho tab shwasan bhagfal kaa maan ikai se kam hota he
 2C51H98O6 + 145O2 → 102CO2 + 98H2O + Energy shwasan main upyog aane vaala khadyapadaarth jab protein hota he tab shwasan-gunank kaa maan 0
4 se 0
9 tak ho saktaa he
 If we know the value of RQ, then we can guess what kind of food is being reacted in respiration
 prakaash-sanshleshan kii kriya main paudhe prakaash kii upasthiti main vaataavaran se carbon daai-oxide ko grahan karte hai tathaa oxigen gas vaataavaran main mukt karte hai
 It is natural to increase the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere and decrease of carbon dioxide, but in reality it is not so
 shwasan kii kriya main sajiv din or raat har samay oxigen gas grahan karte hai tathaa carbon daai-oxide gas kaa vaataavaran main tyaag karte hai
 In this way, the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide gases in the atmosphere is maintained by respiration
 shwasan ek urja-unmochan prakriya he
 In respiration, food is oxidized, releasing the accumulated energy
 shwasan ke samay mukt urja kaa kuch bhaag koshika ke mitocondria main atipi ke rup main sanchit ho jaati he
 This energy, accumulated in the form of ATP, is used to carry out various biological functions of living organisms in future

 Light is produced from the bodies of some insects and sea animals
 yah prakaash shwasan dwaara utpann urja kaa hi ek roopaantarit rup he
 The body of some marine organisms such as electric ray fish and torpedoes, etc
 generates electric waves for self-defense, it is produced by the conversion of energy generated by electric respiration
 prakaash-sanshleshan evam shwasan kii kriyaayein ek duusare kii poorak evam vipareet hoti hai
 In photosynthesis, the chemical reaction between carbon d-oxide and water results in the formation of glucose and release of oxygen
 shwasan main iske vipareet glucose ke oxikaran ke falswaroop jal tathaa carbon daai-oxide banati hai
 Photosynthesis is a creative activity that results in an increase in the dry weight of living organisms
 shwasan ek nasaatmak kriya he, is kriya ke falswaroop sajiv ke shushk bhaar main kami aati he
 Food is produced by the use of solar energy in photosynthesis, radiation energy is converted into chemical energy
 jabaki shwasan main bhojan ke oxikaran se urja mukt hoti he, bhojan main sanchit rasinic urja kaa prayog sajiv apane vibhinn kaaryon main karata he
 Thus, these two activities complement each other by relying on each other's end products for their raw materials
 sajivon ke sharir main prayek koshika main jaev-rasinic kriyaayein hoti rahati hai
 Daily energy is required to perform these actions
 urja kaa mukhya strot bhojan he
 Solar energy is stored as potential energy in food
 shwasan kriya main shwasan kaa mukhya padaarth glucose kaa oxigen kii upasthiti yaa anupasthiti main purna yaa apurna oxikaran hota he, jiske falswaroop bhojan main sanchit sthitij urja gatij urja ke rup main mukt hota he, jisase jivan kii dainik kriyaaon ke sampaadan hetu aavashyak urja kaa unmochan tathaa purti hoti he
 The glucose required for oxidation in respiration is produced between nutrition
 poshan ke liye aavashyak urja, shwasan kriya main utpann urja se praapt hoti he
 In this way, respiration and nutrition are inextricably related to each other

 bhinn ek sankhya he jo purna ke kisi bhaag ko darshaati he
 The fraction is the quotient of two whole numbers
 bhinn kaa ek udhaaharan he 3 5 { \ displaystyle { \ tfrac {3}{5}}} jisamen 3 ansh kehalaata he or 5 har kehalaata he
 There are many variations of fractions: uchit bhinnon ke ansh kaa param maan unke har ke param maan se kam hota he, jais 3 / 4, 2 / 3,5 / 7 The absolute value of the fraction of odd fractions is greater than the absolute value of their denominator, such as 5 / 4,8 / 3,5 / 3

 This point is called 'decimal point' and fraction is 'decimal fraction', such as- dashamalav bhinn ko jodne yaa ghataane ke niyam ve hi hai jo saadhaaran sankhyaon ke liye hai
 The rule of multiplication is that by multiplying the number like ordinary numbers, the decimal points in the product are placed before the number of digits that are the sum of the digits after the decimal of the multiplier and the multiplication, such as 4

 Charvak philosophy is a materialistic atheist philosophy
 yah maatr pratyaksh pramaan ko maanata he tathaa parloukik sattaaon ko yah siddhant sweekaar nahin karata he
 This philosophy is also called Vedabhya
 vedabaahya darshan chha: hai- charvak, madhyamik, yogachaar, sautrantik, vaibhashik, or arhat
 In all these, there is a rendering of principles unrelated to the Veda
 ajit keshakambali ko charvak ke agradoot ke rup main shrey diya jaataa he, jabaki brihaspati ko aamtaur par charvak yaa lokayat darshan ke sansthaapak ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Most of the primary literature of the Charvaka, Jupiter Sutra, is missing or lost
 isaki shikshaaon ko aitihaasik madhyamik sahitya se sankalit kiya gaya he jaise ki shaastra, sutara, or bhartiya mahakavy kavita main or gautam buddha ke samvaad or jain sahitya se
 Charvak was an atheist and atheist logical of ancient India
 ye naastik mat ke pravartak brihaspati ke shishy maane jate hai
 Nothing is known about when Jupiter and Charvak happened
 brihaspati ko chanakya ne apane arthshaastra granth main arthshaastra kaa ek pradhan acharya mana he
 On hearing the name of Charvak, you will remember 'jeeva jeevat sukham jeevat, loan kritva, ghritam peewat' The name 'charvak' has been changed to abusive abusive language
 maanon is siddhant ko maanane vaale sirf karjkhor, bhogavaadi or patit log the
 The prevailing belief is that the word Charvak originated from 'charu' + 'speech'
 zaahir he ki yah namakaran is siddhant ke un virodhiyon dwaara kiya gaya he ki jinka maananaa tha ki yah log mithi-mithi baton se bhole-bhale logon ko bahakaate the
 The term 'lokayat' is used even in Buddhist Pitas for Charvaka doctrines which means 'the system of philosophy which believes in this folk and does not believe in the concept of heaven, hell or liberation'
 Charvak or Lokayat philosophy is also mentioned in Mahabharata, but no original text is available
 zaahir he ki chunki yah apane samay kii sattadhari takaton ke khilaaf baat karata tha, to iske granthon ko nasht kar diya gaya or prachlit kathaon main charvaakon ko khalnaayakon kii tarah pesh kiya gaya
 Charvak's vote is found in Sarvadarshan Sangraha
 padmapurana main likhaa he ki asuron ko bahakaane ke liye brihaspati ne vedaviruddh mat prakat kiya tha
 In relation to the atheist faith, it is written in Vishnupurana that when the demons became very strong with the power of religion, then the gods called on Vishnu
 vishnu ne apane sharir se mayamoh naamak ek purush utpann kiya jisane narmada tat par digbanr rup main jaakar tap karte hue asuron ko bahakaakar dharmamarg main bhrasht kiya
 What Mayamoh preached to the Asuras is very similar to the verses of the Charvak faith given in the Sarvadarsanasangraha
 jaise, - mayamoh ne kaha he ki yadi yajna main maaraa hua pashu swarg jaataa he to yajmaan apane pita ko kyon nahin maar daalata, ityadi
 In the context of Tripuravinash in Lingpuran, there is also a story of a Digambar Muni, inspired by Shiva, being seduced by asuras in a similar way, which aims at the Jains
 valmiki ramayana ayodhya kandamen maharishi jawali ne ramchandra ko banbaas chhod ayodhya laut jane ke liye jo upadesh diya he vah bhi charvak ke mat se bilkul miltaa he
 All these things prove that atheism is very ancient
 iskaa avirbhaav usee samay main samajhnaa chahie jav vaidic karmkaandon kii adhikta logon ko kuch khatakane lagi thi
 Charvak does not believe in God and the hereafter
 paralok na maanane ke kaaran hi inke darshan ko lokayat bhi kehete hai
 Happiness is the main goal of this life in the Sarvadarshan Sangraha by the opinion of Charvaka
 sansar main dukh bhi he, yah samajhakar jo sukh nahin bhogana chaahate, ve murkh hai
 If a fish has thorns, does it not eat any fish? The foursome will go to the field, fearing that no field should be sown? And so on
 charvak aatma ko pruthak koi padaarth nahin maanate
 According to their opinion, alcohol is produced in alcohol due to the combination of jaggery, tandul etc
 Similarly, consciousness is generated by the combination of these four ghosts like earth, water, light and air
 inke vishleshan yaa vinaash se 'main' arthath chetanta kaa bhi naash ho jaataa he
 There is no return etc
 after the name of this conscious body
 ishwar, paralok aadi vishay anumaan ke aadhaar par hai
 But Charvak does not take the inference into evidence except direct
 unka tark he ki anumaan vyaptigyaan kaa ashrith he
 The name of the knowledge that is passed on to us through the senses is extended to the past and future, which is impossible
 man main yah gyaan pratyaksh hota he, yah koi pramaan nahin kyonki man apane anubhav ke liye indriyon kaa hi ashrith he
 If you say that there is prevalence of knowledge through inference, then the error of error comes, because you want to prove the conjecture only on prevalence
 charvak kaa mat sarvadarshansangrah, sarvadarshanshiromani or brihaspatisutra main dekhnaa chahie
 This opinion is also mentioned in the 17th canto of Naishadh
 charvak keval pratyakshvadita kaa samarthan karata he, vah anumaan aadi pramaanon ko nahin maanata he
 In his opinion, the earth is water fast and air is the only four elements from which everything is made
 uske mat main akaash tatv kii sthiti nahin he, inhi chaaron tatwon ke mail se yah deh bani he, inke vishesh prakaar ke sangyojan maatr se deh main chaitanya utpann ho jaataa he, jisko log aatma kehete he
 When the body is destroyed, Chaitanya also disappears
 is prakaar se jeev in bhuto se utpann hokar inhi bhuto ke ke nasht hote hi samaapt ho jaataa he, aage peeche iskaa koi mahatv nahin he
 Therefore, the body that is seen in the conscious is the form of a soul, there is no evidence to be an additional soul from the body
 charvak ke mat se stri putr or apane kutumbiyon se milane or unke dwaara diye jane vaale sukh hi sukh kehalaate he
 To embrace them is to make effort, to eat and live happily in the world
 is darshan main kaha gaya he, ki:- Meaning that as long as you want to live, you should live happily, if you do not have the means, then you should have fun by borrowing from another, who has seen the body come back after burning of the body in the crematorium? charvak darshan ke anusaar prithvi, jal, tej tathaa vaayu ye chaar hi tatva sristi ke mul kaaran hai
 Just like Buddhist, Charvak also believes that there is no element called Akash
 yah shunya maatr he
 Upon coming from its molecular state to the gross state, the above four elements are seen as external world, sense or body
 akaash kii vastvatmak satta na maanane ke peeche inaki pramaan vyavastha kaaran he
 Just as we experience their smell, smell, form and touch, we also express their relatives through senses
 akaash tatva kaa vaisaa pratyaksh nahin hota
 Therefore, there is no element called Akash in their opinion
 chaar mahabhuton kaa mulkaaran kya he? is prashn kaa uttar charvaakon ke paas nahin he
 This world is just a collection or collision of four mahabhutas found in different forms and in different quantities
 charvaakon ke anusaar chaar mahabhuton se atirikt aatma naamak koi anya padaarth nahin he
 Chaitanya is the quality of the soul
 chunki aatma naamak koi vastu he hi nahin at: chaitanya sharir kaa hi gun yaa dharm siddh hota he
 That is, this body is the soul
 isaki siddhi ke teen prakaar he-tark, anubhav or ayurveda shaastra
 For the attainment of the soul by logic, the Charvak people say that the living remains conscious and the absence of the body does not remain conscious
 is anvay vyatirek se sharir hi chaitanya kaa aadhaar arthath aatma siddh hota he
 Experience 'I am gross', 'I am weak', 'I am fair', 'I am inactive' etc
 We experience on foot
 sthulata durbalata ityadi sharir ke dharm hai or 'main' bhi vahi he
 Therefore, the body is the soul
 ayurveda jis prakaar good, jau, mahua aadi ko mila dene se kaal kram ke anusaar us mishran main madshakt utpann hoti he, athwa dahi pili mitti or gobar ke paraspar mishran se usamen bichchhu paidaa ho jaataa he athwa paan, kattha, supaari or chuunaa main laal rang na rahane par bhi unke mishran se munh main laalimaa utpann ho jaati he usee prakaar chaturbhuton ke vishisht sammishran se chaitanya utpann ho jaataa he
 But what is the reason for mixing of these ghosts in specific amounts? The answer to this question is nothing but Charvak
 ishwar-nyaay aadi shastron main ishwar kii siddhi anumaan yaa aapt vachan se kii jaati he
 Since Charvak considers direct and only direct evidence, the only visible king in his opinion is God, he is the controller of his kingdom and the subjects living in it
 at: use hi ishwar maananaa chaiye
 Theorem means accurate knowledge of the subject, that is, proof is required for prama
 charvak lok keval pratyaksh pramaan maanate hai
 Knowledge arising out of the proximity of subject and senses is called direct knowledge
 hamaari indriyon ke dwaara pratyaksh dikhalaayi padane vaala sansar hi prameya he
 Other than this, other substances are discrete
 aankh, kaan, naak, jihva or twachaa ke dwaara rup shabd gandh ras evam sparsh kaa pratyaksh ham sabko hota he
 There is no need for any other evidence for an object which is not empirical
 buddha, jain naamak avaidic darshan tathaa nyayavaisheshik aadi ardhvaidic darshan anumaan ko bhi pramaan maanate hai
 He says that the power of all theorems cannot be proved by direct evidence
 parantu charvak kaa kathan he ki anumaan se keval sambhaavna paidaa kii ja sakati he
 Cognitive knowledge is direct
 duurastha hare bhare vrikshon ko dekhakar vahaan pakshiyon kaa kolahal sunakar, udhar se aane vaali hawa ke thande jhoke se ham vahaan pani kii sambhaavna maanate hai
 The achievement of water is determined by going there and seeing it directly
 at: sambhaavna utpann karne tathaa lokvyavahaar chalaane ke liye anumaan aavashyak hota he kintu vah pramaan nahin ho saktaa
 The prevalence on the basis of which the presumption is considered the power of proof is nothing but coverage
 dhooma ke saath agni kaa, pushp ke saath gandh kaa hona swabhaav he
 Happiness and sorrow of religion and the working sense of unrighteousness are natural
 jaise kokil ke shabd main madhurata tathaa kauwe ke shabd main karkashta swaabhaavik he usee prakaar sarvatra samajhnaa chaiye
 As far as word proof is concerned, it is a kind of direct proof
 aapt purush ke vachan hamako pratyaksh sunaayi dete hai
 Listening to them makes sense
 yah pratyaksh hi he
 As far as the Vedas are concerned, their sentences describe uninteresting and inauspicious topics, so their credibility is relevant
 saath hi adharm aadi main ashwalingagrahan sadrush lajjaspad evam mansabhakshan sadrush ghrinaaspad kaary karne se tathaa jarbhari turfari aadi arthhin shabdon kaa prayog karne se veda apni apramanikta swayan siddh karte hai
 From the above description it becomes clear that the Charvak people do not accept anything other than this directly visible body and world
 dharm, arth, kaam or moksh naamak purusharthchatushtay ko ve log purush arthath manushya deh ke liye upyogi maanate hai
 In his view, meaning and work are the ultimate effort
 dharm naam kii vastu ko maananaa morrkhtaa he kyonki jab is sansar ke atirikt koi anya swarg aadi he hi nahin to dharm ke fal ko swarg main bhogane kii baat anargal he
 It is not religion to perform the yajna etc
 to enjoy the happiness of heaven conceived by the hypocritical rascals, but it is unrighteous due to animal violence, etc
 It is the misuse of things, and the misuse of things and suffering of the waste body
 He should do the same to bring happiness to the body
 jisamen indriyon kii tripti ho man andith ho vahi kaary karnaa chaiye
 Those who are satisfied with the senses should rejoice and those subjects should be consumed
 sharir indriya man ko anandaplavit karne main jo tatva baadhak hote hai unako dur karnaa, na karnaa, maar dena dharm he
 To endure physical mental distress, to force the mind and body from contentment is wrong
 taatpary yah he ki aastik vaidic evam yahan tak ki ardhvedic darshanon main, puraanon smritiyon main varnit aachaar kaa paalan yadi sharir sukh kaa sadhak he to unka anusaran karnaa chaiye or yadi ve uske baadhak hote hai to unka sarvatha sarvada tyaag kar dena chaiye
 The imagination of salvation of the Charvakas is also strongly influenced by the influence of their element, the epistemology and the knowledge epistemology
 jab tak sharir he tab tak manushya naanaa prakaar ke ksht sahataa he
 This is hell
 is ksht samooh se mukti tab milti he jab deh chaitanyarahit ho jaataa he arthath mar jaataa he
 It is salvation to die because the dead body dies experiencing any suffering
 yah maranaa hi moksh he kyonki mrit sharir ko kisi bhi ksht kaa anubhav nahin hota
 Although in other philosophies, the existence of the soul is acknowledged to be free and the nature of salvation is different in different philosophies, yet the Charvakas do not support their belief
 ve na to moksh ko nity maanate hue sanmaatr maanate hai, na nity maanate hue sat or chit swaroop maanate hai na hi ve sachchidanand swaroop main uski sthiti ko hi moksh sweekaar karte hai
 Charvak philosophy is a philosophy that is naturally beloved by the common man
 jis darshan ke vaakya chaaru arthath ruchikar hon vah charvak darshan he
 The practical and temporal antecedent of all classical serious subjects is the Charvak philosophy
 sahaj rup main jo kuch ham karte hai vah sab kuch charvak darshan kaa aadhaar he
 Charvak Darshan looks at every aspect of life with ease
 jivan ke prati yah sahaj drushti hi charvak darshan he
 The reality is that every human life that lives in the world is a Charvak philosophy
 aise vaakya or siddhanth jo sabko romantic lagen lok main aayat yaa vishrut aavashya honge
 Probably this is the reason why we also know Charvak philosophy as Lokayat philosophy
 yah darshan barhospaty darshan ke naam se bhi vidwaanon main prasiddh he
 From this name, it appears that this philosophy is opposed by Jupiter
 brihaspati bhartiya samaaj main devataaon ke guru ke rup main maanya hai
 But Jupiter is not one in Indian literature
 charvak darshan ke pravartak acharya brihaspati koun hai, yah nirnay kar paanaa atyant kathin kaary he
 The mention of two Brihaspati in Aigaras and Laukya forms is found in the Rigveda
 ashwaghosh ke anusaar anigaras brihaspati rajshastra ke praneta hai
 The origin of the true substance is believed to be from Asat in the opinion of Laukya Jupiter
 isi prakaar asat padaarth kii utpatti sat se maani gayi he
 The roots are called discrete
 chetan padaarthon ko is manyata ke anusaar sat kaha jaataa hai
 The instruction of a Jupiter is also found in the Van Parva of Mahabharata
 yah brihaspati shukr kaa swaroop dhaaran kar indra kaa sarankshan evam daanvon kaa vinaash karne ke uddeshy se anaatmavaad yaa prapanch vigyaan kii sanrachana karata he
 As a result of this great science, considering the auspicious as inauspicious and inauspicious, demons get involved in criticism and blasphemy of Vedas and scriptures
 anya prasang main mahabharat main hi ek or brihaspati kaa varnan miltaa he jo shukracharya ke saath mil kar pravanchanashastra kii rachana karte hai
 If the teachers of various scriptures are to be believed, then the Charvak faith cannot be considered in the category of philosophy because in this philosophy, the work of deception is done only in the guise of sweet words
 yah baat or he ki yadi charvak kii sunen to vah bhi vibhinn shastragyon ko vanchak hi ghoshit karata he
 a description of such a Jupiter is found in the Taittriya Brahmana text that strikes the forehead of Gayatri Devi, Gayatri Devi has been considered as the origin of all the Vedas according to the Padma Purana
 is drushti se yah brihaspati veda kaa virdohi mana ja saktaa he
 Possibly because of opposing the Vedas, it would be reasonable to consider this Jupiter as the leader of the Charvak philosophy
 vishnu puraana main bhi brihaspati kaa prasang praapt hota he
 According to this belief of Jupiter, the Vedic ritual is practiced by the expenditure and effort of polygamy
 vividh sukh ke sadhak ye vaidic upaay kuch arth lolup swaarth kendrit dhurton kaa hi vidhaan he
 a description of the logical Jupiter is also found somewhere
 ye brihaspati veda ke anugami to avashya hai par tarksmmat anushthanon kaa hi samarthan karte hai
 From their point of view, the decision must be based on scripture, but it is absolutely necessary to maintain this classical research logic
 tark virahit chintan dharm ke nirdhaaran main kabhi bhi sarthak nahin ho saktaa he
 Vatsyayana Muni has mentioned Jupiter as the author of Arthashastra in his world famous book Kamasutra
 brihaspati dwaara virachit arthshaastra ke ek sutara ke anusaar shaastra ke rup main maatr lokayat ko hi manyata di gayi he
 As a result, it is very difficult to distinguish between Jupiter, the pioneer of economics and the originator of Lokayata Shastra
 kuch samalochakon ne arthshaastra ke evam lokayat shaastra ke nirmaataa ko abhinn maanane ke saath-saath kamasutron ke praneta bhi brihaspati hi hai, yah mana he
 If the fulfillment of cosmic desires is the aim of Charvak philosophy, then the founder of Kamasastra, Muni Vatsyayan, is Jupiter, it is only appropriate to believe
 kautilya ne arthshaastra main lokayat darshan kaa sahaj pratipaadan kiya he
 In this way, Kautilya, the creator of Arthashastra and Jupiter, the proponent of Lokayat philosophy, is the same
 koshkaar hemachandra ke anusaar arthshaastra, kamasutra, nyayasutra-bhashya, panchatantra evam chanakya niti ke rachayita ek hi he
 After such deliberation, the names of the Jupiter which are discussed in various contexts in Vedic Vamāya are clearly explained in this way
 padam puraana ke sandarbh main angira brahma ke maanas putr hai
 Angiras Brihaspati is the son of Angira and grandson of Brahma
 falat: inaki devon main gananaa hoti he
 In this way, there can be no distinction between Dev Guru Jupiter and Angiras Jupiter
 devon kii sangraksha ke liye devataaon ke guru dwaara asuron ko pradutt upadesh vibhinn lokon main aayat ho gaya yah kathan dev guru brihaspati ke sandarbh main vishwasaneey nahin ho saktaa
 Why would Asuras respect the teachings of Devguru under his guru Shukracharya? Therefore, no one is expected to be the originator of Charvaka philosophy other than Devguru
 kuch samalochakon ne spasht rup se sweekaar kiya he ki charvak ke guru brihaspati, swarg ke swami indra ke acharya vishwavikhyath brihaspati nahin hai
 This Brihaspati is the guru of a royal family
 aitihaasik drushti se denkhe to vasishtha, vishwamitra, dronacharya aadi kaa kisi rajkul kaa guru hona is manyata ko aadhaar bhi de rahaa he
 Just as Shankara philosophy is accepted as Shiromani in theistic philosophies, similarly the Charvak philosophy is undisputed as Shiromani as the most outstanding atheist among the atheist philosophies
 naastik shiromani charvak isliye bhi mana jaataa he ki vah vishwa main vishwaas ke aadhaar par kisi na kisi rup main maanya ishwar kii alokik sarvamaanya satta ko sire se nakaar detaa he
 According to them, there is no object named God in the world
 naastik shiromani charvak jo kuch bahari indriyon se dikhaai detaa he anubhoot hota he, usee kii satta ko sweekaar karata he
 This is the reason that no other proof is considered in the theory of Charvak except for the direct evidence
 jis ishwar kii kalpana anya darshanon main kii gai he uski satta pratyaksh pramaan se sambhav nahin he
 According to their opinion, it is unnecessary and laughable to assume the role of God in the seedling that emerges from the seed
 ankur kii utpatti to mitti evam jal ke sanyog se nitant swaabhaavik evam sahaj prakriya se sarvanubhav siddh he
 Approval of an unseen actor to complete this natural work is meaningless
 ishwar ko na maanane par jeev saamaanya ke shubh evam ashubh karmon ke fal kii vyavastha kaise sambhav hogi? is prashn kaa samaadhaan karte hue charvak poochta he ki kis karm fal kii vyavastha apekshit? sansar main do prakaar ke karm dekhe jate hai
 One is cosmic and the other is supernatural action
 kya aap loukik karmon ke fal kii vyavastha ke sambandh main chintit hai? yadi haan, to yah chintaa anaavashyak he
 Legislative deeds result in legislation, which is the only accepted king or administrator in the world
 yah sarvanubhav siddh tathy, pratyaksh hi he
 We see that the charitable deeds, etc
, prohibit those who perform the prohibited work, by sending them the proper fruits of their misdeeds, as Lok Siddha Raja, in the prison etc
 as punishment
 isi prakaar kisi kii praan raksha aadi shubh karm karne vaale purush ko raja hi puraskaar rup main sufal arthath dhan dhaany evam sammaan se vibhooshit kar detaa he
 If you are truthful about the arrangement of the fruits of supernatural actions, then you should not worry too
 kyonki parloukik fal kii drushti se vihit ye sabhi yajna, puja, paath tapasya aadi vaidic karm jan saamaanya ko thagne kii drushti se tathaa apni aajeevika evam udar ke bharan poshan ke liye kuch dhurton dwaara kalpit hue hai
 In fact, Agnihotra, the three Vedas, the wearing of Tridand and the devouring of Bhasma from place to place in the body are the only sign of wisdom and effortlessness
 in vaidic karmon kaa fal aaj tak kisi ko bhi drushti gochar nahin hua he
 If Vedic deeds had any fruit, it would have been evident to someone till date
 at: aaj tak kisi ko bhi in vaidic yaa varnashram-vyavastha se sambaddh karmon kaa fal-swarg, moksh, devloak gaman aadi pratyaksh anubhuti nahin he at: ye samast vaidic karm nishphal hi hai, yah swat: yukti purvak siddh ho jaataa he
 Here if the believer says that the trade that proves the heavens etc
 is unseen or religion and unrighteousness which leads to the attainment of heaven, then it is not acceptable to Charvak
 alokik adrusht kaa khandan karte hue charvak swarg aadi paralok ke saadhan main adrusht kii bhoomika ko nirast karata he tathaa is prakaar aastik darshan ke mul par hi kutharaghaat kar detaa he
 This is the reason that along with the abrogation of heaven and heaven, which is proven on the basis of the unseen, as well as the regulator or administrator of this unseen, the God also becomes spontaneous in the Charvak faith
 charvak mat main koi jeev sharir se bhinn nahin he
 The body is the soul or soul
 falat: sharir kaa vinaash jab mrityu ke uparant dah sanskaar hone ke baad ho jaataa he tab jeev yaa jeevatma bhi vinasht ho jaataa he
 The solution of four or five mahabhutas in the body is the reason for enlightenment
 yah jeev mrityu ke anantar paralok jaataa he yah manyata bhi, sharir ko hi chetan yaa aatma sweekaar karne se niraadhaar hi siddh hoti he
 Even the ultimate effort of salvation as defined in the scriptures does not accept Charvaka
 chetan sharir kaa naash hi is mat main moksh he
 Due to the absence of religion and unrighteousness, there is no invisible heaven and hell, fruit etc
 in the Charvak theory, it is proved unintended
 charvak mat main sharir ko hi aatma maan lene par baalyavastha main anubhoot kanduk kreedaa aadi kaa vriddhavastha yaa yuvavastha main samaran kaise hota he? yah ek jvalant prashn sahaj hi uth khadaa hota he
 It cannot be said here that the body of childhood, the body of old age and the body of youth are the same
 yadi teenon avasthaaon kaa sharir ek hi hota to in teenon avasthaaon ke shariron main itnaa bada antar nahin hota
 From the difference, it is clearly proved that the components of the body which are meat bodies etc
 increase and decrease
 tathaa in hraas evam vruddhi ke kaaran hi baalyavastha ke sharir kaa naash evam yuvavastha ke sharir kii utpatti hoti he yah bhi siddh hota he
 If you say that this is the same body in the body of puberty, because of this behavior, the above remembrance can be generated by considering the body as one, then this statement also cannot be justified
 kyonki yah vahi sharir he yah pratybhigyaan to swaroop evam akruti kii samanta ke kaaran hota he
 As a result, the bodies of both the states cannot be considered integral
 aisi sthiti main purv darshit balya-kaal ke samaran ko sampann karne ke liye charvak balykaal ke sharir main utpann krida se janya sanskaar duusare yuva-kaal ke sharir main apane jaise hi naye sanskaar paidaa kar dete hai
 In the same way, the rites existing in the body of puberty produce the same rites in the body of old age
 etavata in baalyavastha ke sanskaron ke udbodhan se charvak mat main samaran bina kisi baadha ke ho jaataa he
 After all, in Charvak philosophy, the body is the soul, it proves to be natural
 yadi sharir hi aatma he to charvak se yah poocha ja saktaa he ki 'mam shariram' yah meraa sharir he, aisa loksiddh jo vyavhaar he vah kaise utpann hoga? is vyavhaar se to yah prathit ho rahaa he ki sharir alag he evam sharir kaa swami koi or he, jo sharir se bhinn aatma hi he
 Addressing this question, Charvak says that even though the head of a particular demon has been called Rahu, the common man 'rahu's head' behaves in a very natural way, in the same way that the body itself is a soul
 This popular practice will also be born as 'my body'
 charvaakon main kuch charvak indriyon ko hi aatma maanane par indriya ke nasht hone par samaran kii aapatti kaa niraas nahin ho paata he
 Some charvakas have also considered soul and mind as soul
 sharir hi aatma he yah siddh karne ke liye charvak is veda ke sandarbh ko bhi aastikon ke santosh ke liye prastut karata he
 This Vedic text implies that 'a spirit with science originates from these ghosts and finally merges with these ghosts
 yah bhuton main sharir swaroop aatma kaa vilay hi mrityu he
 ' dakshini akshansh ke kshetron arthath uposhna ucch vayudab katibandhon se bumadhyarekhiy nimna vayudab katibandh kii ore donon goladhon main varsh bhar nirantar pravaahit hone vaale pawan ko vyapaarik pawan kaha jaataa hai
 These winds continuously flow in one direction throughout the year
 saamanytah is pawan ko uttari golarddh main uttar se dakshin disha main tathaa dakshin golarddh main dakshin se uttari disha main pravaahit hona chahie, kintu feril ke niyam evam coroolis bal ke kaaran ye uttari golarddh main apni daayin or tathaa dakshin golarddh main apni baayin ore vikshepit ho jaati hai
 The winds of continuous flow throughout the year in both the Earth's shells from the subtropical high-pressure tropics to the equatorial low-pressure tropics, about 30 degrees north and south latitudes in the geographical location of the Earth, are called commercial winds
 inhen angreji main ‘trade winds’ kehete hai
 Here the word 'trade' is derived from the German language, which means the specified path or route
 isse spasht he ki ye hawaaen ek nirdisht path par vasharbhar ek hi disha main bahati rahati hai
 In the Northern Hemisphere, these winds flow from the north-east to the south-west, while in the southern hemisphere, their direction is from southeast to northwest
 niyamit disha main nirantar pravaah ke kaaran pracheen kaal main vyapaariyon ko palayukt jalayanon ke sanchaalan main in hawaaon se kaaphi madad milti thi, jis kaaran inhen vyapaarik pawan kaha jane laga
 The two commercial winds near the equator rise up together due to extreme temperatures and rains heavily as they reach and become fully saturated with water vapor
 in hawaaon kaa vaishvik mausam par bhi vyapak asar hota he

 It is especially used in writing Arabic letters, which is considered part of Islamic culture
 or yah aksharankan farsi aksharankan se liya gaya he
 In Arabic, 'khat' means 'streak' or 'tamir'
 yah islaami aksharankan kii tarqi quran ko likhane main siddhhast logon dwaara hui, jo islaami samskruti kaa hissaa ban gai
 These letters can be seen as artifacts on many buildings such as Qila, Masjid, Madrasa, Dargah, Kabrastan Wagaira
 urdu main is kala ko "khattati" kehete hai
 It still has training centers in India

 Islamic alphabet is not only on paper, but also on paving, utensils, carpet, and stones
 kagaz ke banane se pehle khaalon par, kenvas par, kapadon par ye kala pradarshit hoti thi
 After making paper, there was revolution in this art
 jab europe carch ke monasteries main darjanon kitaaben thim to muslim duniya main saikadon balki hajaaron kitaaben pai gai
 : 218 sikke bhi is kala ke liye upyogit the
 In the era of the Islamic Khilafat in 692 AD, coins began to be used in place of pictures, which were commonly written on the denominations of the Quran
 dasvin shatabdi main, persian, jo islam dharm main shaamil huve, is aksharankan kala ko reshmi kapadon par, kalinon par pradarshit karne lage
 At that time such clothes were considered valuable

 : 223–5 kufik style, arabi kii pracheen lipi style he
 The way of corner making in this letter writing reminds us of ancient Nabatian letters
 is kufik style main 17 akshar aise hai jin ko arab nahin hote
 Then, it is made useless and short, with the help of which the reader can read it with correct pronunciation
 arabi akshar baad main 29 ho gayi
 This style originated in the Iraqi city of Kufa, and flourished in the 7th century
 isi nagar ke naam se is style ko kufi yaa kufik style naam sthir hua
 This style went on to be written in many forms, such as floral, etching, peaked, boarder forms, and chaturcryas form
 yah sheliyaan 8 se 10 veen shatabdi ke dauraan "quran" kii kapiyaan likhane main upyog kii jaati thim
 Later in the 11th century it was also used as an ordinary script
 saath saath alankaran karne ke liye bhi yah style kaa upyog hone laga
 There are no specific formulas for the use of the coffee style; The only formula or method is to write its letters angularly
 is ko likhane kaa koi khaas tareeqa yaa sutara nahin hone ke kaaran yah style anya deshon main anya tareekhon se upyog hone lagi
 Writers also started writing it in their own way, in which clever designs began to be used beautifully in the shape of flowers
 is style ke saadhaaran rup:or "ali" style jo chatursreey rup main likhi jaye use "bannai" kehete hai
 Contemporary lettering artists are used today for new decorations and thus are popular
 shilalekhon ke alankaran ke liye yurap main upyogit style isi kufi kii nakal he jo madhya yug or saanskruthik punarujeevankaal main upyog kiya jaataa tha
 Did not know what the reasons are for the use of this style
 aisa bhi lagata he ki pashchimi log 13 or 14 veen shatabdi main upyogit yah style kristu ke jivan kaal kii thi, bhram tha
 Cursive script was also in use with this coffee style
 kintu praarambhik avasthaa main is style main koi sthir sutara nahin the is liye anaupchaarik uddeshy ke taur par upyogit thi
 After the emergence of Islam, the need for a new script was also realized for practice, for conversion, and the new popular style, the Narsha style, transformed in the 10th century
 is lipi ko lekh likhane, sarkari lekhanon main, vyaktigat patr-vyavhaar main or quran likhane main upyog hone laga
 This script became the foundation of the new Arabic script
 is lipi kaa maanakeekaran kaa kirit "ebn muqla" ko jaataa he, baad main abu hayaan at-tauhidi or mohammad ebn abd arrahmaman ko jaataa he
 Ibn Mukla is considered to be the inventor of the nascent lettering alphabet
 is ne naskh lipi likhane ke kai sutara bhu bataaye, jis main thodi galtiyaan bhi dekhi gayin
 Some forms of racial lipography: islam dharm jaise badhane or failane laga arabi lipi bhi duniya ke kai praanton main sthapit huvi
 And in the 14th century, Arabic script writing also flourished in Turkey, Persia, and China

hospital main uski duusari ‘open heart’ surgery hui
 This operation, which went on continuously for 11 hours, was extremely complicated
 chunki isamen dil ko sharir se alag kar uske kaary mashin ko saunpna hote hai, lihaaja marij ke praanon par sankat bhi bana rahata he
 Rudraksha, undergoing that long operation of 11 hours, was put on a 'heart-lung machine' for the next five days under 'post operation care', as his heart was unable to function properly due to deep fatigue
 aaparishan ke dauraan atyaadhik raktasrav hone se use 14 unit rakt bhi diya gaya
 The happy coincidence is that after the ventilator was removed, his heart started functioning

 On receiving the information, when we reached there, we were stunned to see it
 ek sundar se balak ko bahut salike se oonee kapadon main lapetakar koi vahaan rakh gaya tha
 In our country, due to all the social evils, the brutal incidents of killing a newborn girl or leaving her to die on the streets have been happening, but how can anyone leave a child so beautiful! It was a big surprise

 The caretaking practitioners of Vatsalya Village, Vrindavan's 'cradle House' and erstwhile 'pushpanjali Crossley Hospital' with great silence saved the lives of many such children who had reached the cusp of death

 varsh 2014 kii garmiyon ke din
 It was reported in the office of Vatsalya Village, Vrindavan that a couple want to contact the administrative department of the institution and they also have a small newborn girl with them
 aamtaur par vatsalya gram, vrundavan kaa darshan karne vaale aagatuk sabase pehle swaagat kaksh or karyaalay main hi aate hai, to hamen laga ki vah ek saamaanya shishtachar bhent ke liye icchhuk honge
 He was called inside
 kaksh main pravesh karte hue ve donon buje-buje se dikhe
 He told that he is from a peasant family
 aage poochne par us yuvak kii patni ne rote hue kaha ki -‘ham yahan apni nanheen navjaat bacchee ko chhodane ke liye aae hai
 'we were surprised to learn that the financial condition of the young middle class farmer family was not so bad that he could not raise the child
 jigyaasa prakat karne par us mahila ne vistaarpurvak bataaya ki -‘mujhe iske pehle bhi ek beti he, jiske janm ke samay mere sasuraal ke logon ne mujhe kaaphi taane die the
 They wanted a son and it was painful for them to give birth to my daughter
 aisa laga hi nahin ki mere pati ko chhodkar or koi khush tha, uske janm par
 After that, when i was pregnant again, my son wanted birth, my in-laws put pressure on me to test the fetus
 yah jaanate hue bhi ki bhrun kaa ling pareekshan karana dandaneey aparaadh he, maine apane sasur ke dabaav main jab yah pareekshan karavaaya to pataa chalaa ki mere garbh main phir se kanya hi he
 On discovering this, there was a chaos in the family
 turant hi mujhe garbhpaat karwaane ke liye baadhya karne kii koshishen shuru ho gayi
 But i was adamant on my decision that i would not allow my unborn fetus to be killed under any circumstances
 mere parivaar dwaara us kanya bhrun ko samaapt karne kii tamaam koshishon ke bich bhi maine us duusari kanya ko janm diya
 The protests between which i gave birth made it so difficult to raise her, which i had never imagined
 mujhe use stanpan karaane tak se rokane kii koshishen rhuin
 That hungry and thirsty newborn baby wept bitterly and i was entangled in some work, due to which i could not reach her
 paanch dinon kii vah bacchee kamjor to pehle se hi thi kyonki meri garbhavastha ke dauraan mujhe paushtik aahaar milanaa to dur, saamaanya bhojan bhi thik se nahin diya gaya
 All efforts were made keeping in mind that even if that girl dies in my womb
 lekin meri ichha shakti ke kaaran vah janmi
 When he got fever after ten to twelve days, i was stopped from taking him to the doctor
 ab mujhe yah lagane laga tha ki mere sasuraal vaale is bacchee kii jaan lekar hi rahenge
 i started thinking in this direction that even if this girl is no longer with me, but it is very important to survive
 isi soch-vichaar ke bich mujhe khyaal aayaa ki didi maan sadhvi ritambhra ji kaa ek vatsalya gram he vrundavan main
 Why not leave this girl in their shelter
 kitne hi bacchon ko wo paal rahi hai, to unke saath ye bhi pal jaaegi
 At least it will save its life
 yahi vichaar karke aaj ham donon pati-patni chupchaap ghar se bhagkar yahan aa gaye hai or is bacchee ko vatsalya gram main chhodkar janaa chaahate hai
 While describing this incident, Kalam was unable to write down the pain of the mother who had seen her mother breastfeed her dear daughter last time
 bacchee ko paal paane kii kshamta hone ke baavjood bhi use apane se alag karte hue us maan ke fatate kaleje kii dhamak vahaan maujuud sabhi logon ke dilon ko hilaa rahi thi
 She would hug the girl again and again
 bukhaar se tap rahi bacchee ko hameshaa ke liye apane se alag karte samay us maan kii chatapataahat ko shabdon main vyakt nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Witnesses of this scene were bowed down to the resolve power of the mother, who, despite all the pressures, not only gave birth to that girl but she had reached Vatsalya village amidst many struggles to save her life
 vatsalya parivaar ek vivash maan ke us sankalp kaa abhaari tha, jo kahin na kahin didi maan ji ke ‘beti bachaao andolan’ kaa ek hissaa banane ja rahaa tha
 Seeing the pain of that mother, everyone's eyes were full
 vatsalya gram ne pehali baar ye drishy dekha tha jab koi maan vatsalya ke paalane main apni mamata ko sabake saamne rote-bilakhte hue chhodkar ja rahi ho
 This thought kept arising in the mind and mind, how cruel a person is! Seeing that beautiful, fragile baby girl with an aura like Goddess, we all were shocked that how can someone be intent on killing this newborn granddaughter! Generally, such children are secretly left in the cradle house of Vatsalya village, but this was a different case, in which the parents of the child themselves wanted to present themselves and hand over the child with their helplessness
 In Vatsalya village accepted the girl with her written consent
 itane varshon ke baad aaj vah bacchee puure vatsalya parivaar main anya bacchon ke samaan hi sabaki ladli he

 Just a few days ago, the opportunity to visit Vrindavan, the Leela site of Shri Krishna, was obtained

 yah aadhunik tirth didi maan ke naam se vikhyath sadhvi ritambhra ne basaaya he

 ek adhed yaa bujurg mahila nani kehalaati hai, ek yuvati usee parivaar kaa ang hoti he jise mausi kaha jaataa he or usamen do shishu hote hai
 This family unit is also fully autonomous by staying in the premises
 mausi or nani apana ghar chhodkar puraa samay is prakalp ko detii hai or vatsalya gram kaa yah parivaar hi unka parivaar hota he
 Apart from this, Vatsalya village has given helpline facility in major cities of the country, so that any such newborn who has been left destitute after birth due to some reason, gives volunteers of Vatsalya village to Vrindavan under his protection
 didi maan ne ek balika ko bhi dikhaaya jise navjaat sthiti main dilli main koodaydaan main phenk diya gaya tha or usak mastishk kaa kuch hissaa kute kha gayi the
 Today that girl is healthy and has turned four years old
 aise kitne hi shishuon ko aashray didi maan ne diya he parantu unka laalan-paalan aatmaheenata ke vaataavaran main nahin varan sanskaaraksham paariwarik vaataavaran main ho rahaa he
 This originality separates Vatsalya village from the imagination of orphanages
 didi maan yah prakalp dekhakar jo pehla vichaar mere man main aayaa vah hindutv kii vyapaktaa or uske bahuaiami swaroop ko lekar aayaa
 These are the same Sadhvi Ritambhara whose lion roar energized the 1989-90 Sri Ram temple movement, but within the same aggressive lioness is also the heart of a woman full of passion that is moved for social sensation

 jinaki gaatha aaj bhi puraane log sunaate hai
 It is believed that most of the ancestors of Mahatma Buddha were also followers of Parshvanath religion
 
 The Jain texts describe the Tirthankara Parshvanatha for nine previous births
 pehle janm main brahman, duusare main hathi, tisare main swarg ke devtaa, chauthe main raja, paanchaven main dev, chhathwein janm main chakravarti samraat or saatven janm main devtaa, aath main raja or nauven janm main raja indra tatpashchaat dasven janm main unhen tirthankar banane kaa saubhaahgya praapt hua
 As a result of the accumulated virtues of previous lives and the tenacity of the tenth birth, they become Tirthankaras

 It is then revealed that Nisha needed a lot of money to get her younger brother treated for cancer
 is kaaran usne prem ko chhod kar ek amir aadmi se shaadi karne kaa nirnay liya tha
 When Rahul came to know about this, he treated his brother without seeing any benefit
 lekin nisha ko koi or pasand tha, is kaaran usne shaadi karne se inkaar kar diya
 Priya and Rahul get engaged and Nisha's brother also recovers completely
 rahul ko nisha dhanyavad de kar waapas prem ke paas lautne kaa nirnay leti he

 He says that he can no longer marry her and leaves her with good luck
 uske agle hi din nisha kii vimaan main mulaaqaat rahul or priya se hoti he jo donon shaadi ke liye agra ja rahe hai
 She congratulates them both and Priya also congratulates her for being back with love
 nisha use bataati he ki ab prem usase pyaar nahin karata, use koi or ladki se pyaar he
 Priya is shocked to hear this
 nisha kahati he ki wo us ladki ko nahin jaanati, lekin priya ko dil hi dil main aisa lagata he ki wo ladki vahi he
 To stop Priya and Rahul's marriage by coincidence, Prem and his family also board the same plane
 prem apni dil kii baat bataane ke liye ek gaanaa gaata he or priya us gane ko sun kar samaj jaati he ki prem usase pyaar karata he
 When the plane takes off in Agra, Prem and Priya become one and at the same time Rahul and Nisha are also together
