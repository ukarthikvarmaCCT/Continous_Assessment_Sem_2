 Helen Fisher is a leading love expert
 unhonen pyaar ke tajurbe ko teen hisson main vibhaajan kiya hai: havas, aakarshan, aasakti
 Lust is sexual desire

 Attachment includes living the house, parental duty, mutual protection and a sense of security
 vaasana praarambhik aveshpurna yon ichha he, jo sambhog ko badhaava detaa he
 It promotes intercourse and the release of chemicals
 iskaa prabhaav kuch hafte yaa mahinon tak hi hota he

 As humans start making love, there is a release of a type of chemical in their brain

 vikasvaadi manovigyaan ne pyaar ko jivit rahane kaa ek pramukh saadhan sabit karne ke liye anek kaaran diya hai
 According to them, humans rely more on their parental support than other mammals during their lifetime, because of this love has also been considered as the mechanism of propagating parental support
 ye isaliye bhi ho saktaa hai, kyonki pyaar ke kaaran yon sanchaarit rog ho saktaa he jisaki vajah se manushya ke janankshmata par asar pad saktaa hai, bhrun par chot aa sakati hai, bachche paidaa karte vaqt ulajhanein bhi ho sakati hai ityadi

 In the 17th century, the 'anglican Church' was used for this

 During the reign of Henry VIII, Luther practiced Protestant religion in Germany
 iske virodh main henry ashtum ne 1521 i
 main ek granth likhaa jisamen unhone rome ke bishap ke ishwardutt adhikaar kaa pratipaadan kiya
 Henry received the title of guard on behalf of Rome
 baad main pope ne henry kaa pratham vivaah amaanya tehraane tathaa isko doosraa vivaah kar lene kii anumati dene se inkaar kiya
 As a result, the Parliament accepted an act by Henry's request in which the king was declared to be the Church of England
 
 After this significant change Henry VIII successfully attempted to uphold the Catholic doctrines intact by opposing Protestant ideas throughout his life
 england ke giraje kaa parmadhikari hone ke naate usne mathon kii sampatti apanaakar unka unmoolan kiya
 Under the leadership of Cranmer, the Catholic form of the Anglican Church changed a lot during the reign of Edward Sixt and many of the Protestant ideas were invented in the 'book of Common Prayer'
 apane bhai edward ke nidhan par meri tuder ne kuch samay tak roman katholic carch ke saath carch ov england kaa sampark pun: sthapit kiya kintu uski bahan elizabeth ne carch ov england ko purna rup se swatantra tathaa rashtriya carch bana diya
 First of all, by a new act, like his father, Henry VIII, he had prerogative over the Church of England and by a second act made Edward's Second Book of Common Prayer mandatory
 
 In this way, the work of formulation of the principles of the Church of England also went ahead and 39 sources were approved by the Parliament in 1562 AD and Queen Elizabeth in 1563 AD

 The history of the Anglican Church is primarily the ups and downs of its various ideologies

 He denies the authority of Rome as the Protestant religion, but he teaches, like the Roman Catholic Church, that the Bible is not the sole basis of Christianity
 bible ke atirikt vah katholic giraje kii pratham chaar mahasabhaon ke nirnay bhi sweekaar karata he tathaa bible kii vyakhya main giraje kii pracheen parampara ko bahut mahatv detaa he
 Yet he is somewhat indifferent to doctrinal uniformity in relation to religious education
 falswaroop anglican carch main praaia: prarambh se hi kai vichaardhaaraon athwa dalon kaa astitv rahaa he
 Although many Anglicans do not accept being a follower of any party, as before, even today, there are mainly three different ideologies present in Anglican religion- pravartan ke samay se hi anglican carch par prostetent dharm kaa prabhaav padaa
 This effect is particularly targeted in the following things - dismantling of the yajna, the tendency to give less importance to the priesthood and rituals, the effort to reduce the authority of the bishops
 is vichaardhaara ke anuyaayi pehle to carch ke naam se vikhyath the kintu aajkal ve apane ko avengelical kahkar pukaarte hai
 When the Anglican Church first began to break away from the Roman Catholic Church, no one thought of running a new religion
 baad main bhi anglican dharmapanditon kaa ek dal nirantar is praytn main rahaa ki anglican dharm jahaan tak ban pade siddhant tathaa puujaapaddati kii drushti se roman katholic dharm se dur na hone paae
 The group was named the 'high Church' and remained paramount for some time in the first half of the 17th century under the leadership of Bishop Lord

 Its followers call themselves anglo-catholic and consider the Anglican Church to be a branch of the Catholic Church

 It seems quite natural that in a religion where there was scope for the above conflicting Catholic and Avengelic ideologies, some people would be inclined towards concord and give less importance to the doctrine
 unke anusaar dharmasiddhant ishwar dwaara prakat kiye hue dharmik satya kaa antim sutrikaran nahin he, ye yugavishesh kii dharmik bhaawanaaon kii darshanik abhivyakti maatr hai
 In the 17th century the group was named 'latitudinarian', in the 18th century it was called 'liberal' and later 'broad Church'

 The area of anglican religion was not limited to England

 Sam realizes that the Decepticons removed the columns long before the Autobots left for the Ark campaign, then left the Sentinel and all five columns for the Autobots as a pre-plan - because only the Sentinel is the key to activate those columns
 And Decepticons needed him until he was revived through Optimus
