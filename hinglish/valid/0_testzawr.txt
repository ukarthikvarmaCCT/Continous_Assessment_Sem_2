 The revered Dattopant ji Thengdi, while adhering to the Hindu tradition, said that, inspired by patriotism, autonomous and self-governing mass organizations would successfully play the role of impunity on the rule of power, then the state would follow Rajdharma

 In 1928, Stalin announced the first five-year plan
 is yojana ke teen mukhya uddeshy the - samuhik krishi, baari udyogon kii sthapana or nae shramik samaaj kaa nirmaan
 The government used to buy the grain produced in the collective farms at a fixed rate and used to rent tractors

 The rich peasants opposed this but they were suppressed
 1940 i
 main 86% ann samuhik kheton main, 12 % sarkari formon main or keval 1 % vyaktigat kisaanon ke kheton main utpann hone laga
 Thus in about 12 years this revolutionary change in agriculture took place in Russia
 udyogon kaa vikaas karne ke liye turkistan main bijli kaa utpaadan badhaayaa gaya
 As a result of the new revolution, in 1937 only 10% of the people remained illiterate whereas before 1917 79% were illiterate

 He became the leading country in the manufacture of tractors, rail engines
 yahi vajah he ki naaji akraman ke dauraan rus ne uskaa safaltaapurvak saamana kiya

 The game of chicken, also known as the hawk game or the snow mound, is a kind of conflict between two opponents in game theory
 isamen donon ke bich main ek aisi pratiyogita shuru ho jaati he jisamen donon main se koi bhi peeche nahin hatana chahta lekin kisi ke bhi na hatane par donon ko baari haani hoti he
 In this, the name of 'murgi' has come from the game in which two drivers speed their respective vehicles towards each other
 donon main se ek ko haar maanakar alag mudana hoga, varanaa takaraav main donon kii maut bhi ho sakati he
 But whichever is removed first will be considered as 'chickens', ie Buzdil or cowards
 yah 'muri kaa khel' vaala naam raajnneeti or arthshaastra main adhik prayog hota he
 For example, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States continued to escalate and a nuclear holocaust could occur if there was no retreat, but the Soviet Union pulled back

 In this game, there is often a dilemma in the mind of both the players
 agar lage ki doosraa darkar hat jayega to date rahanaa chahie
 The loss of the one who is removed also includes insulting the other, because the other one seems brave while the one who withdraws is a coward
 lekin agar donon yahi sochakar ant tak date rahen to donon kaa hi baari nuksaan ho saktaa he
