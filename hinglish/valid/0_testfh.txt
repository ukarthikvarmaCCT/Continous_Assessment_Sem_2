 Albinism is a disease of the eyes in which the patient is not able to perceive any one or more colors; Due to which the power of color perception is less than the power of color of ordinary people
 yah rog janm se ho saktaa he, athwa katipay rogon ke baad utpann ho saktaa he
 The ordinary person can well perceive the lightness or deepness of the color
 par is rog main vyakti kii rangon ke gaharepan kaa bodh yaa rangon ko pahchaanane kii shakti lupt ho jaati he
 Different classes of disease and their names are also based on the perception of one color or mixture of colors in the spectrum
 manushya main samaan rup se rang kaa bodh trivarnataa ke siddhant se hota he
 According to this theory, color perception occurs through a diverse mixture of three colors
 ye teenon shuddh or mukhya rang hai : laal, haraa tathaa nila; jinaki pruthak maatra ke mishran se sab prakaar ke rang ban jate hai tathaa in pruthak rangon kaa vishesh bodh drushti dwaara hota he

 Disorders of color blindness are most commonly found in unicellular individuals, less frequently in diabetic individuals, and lastly in the least tivaric individuals

 It is true that such a colorless person generates the power to identify objects only by the varied depth, brightness, and shape of the color, but such a person makes a mistake in deciding on the subjects dependent on the knowledge of color recognition
 There may be severe consequences, for example mistake of identifying traffic signal etc

 The purpose of telling jokes is to create banter

 Psychologists and researchers on literature have studied this question very deeply as to why people laugh jokingly at jokes

 And then it seems that it is not crazy at all, so the tension is reduced but a little bit of strength remains
 or phir ekadam se tanaav phir se bhadak uthta he
 In any case, it is important that this fluctuation of stress seems to be accidental, that is, where tension is expected to increase, it will reverse and where it seems likely to decrease, it will go up
 achche chutkula sunaane vaale is tanaav ke bahaav ko apane niyantran main rakhte hai
 There is not much fluctuation of tension in some Latifas, but in them also there is something contrary to expectation which will be startled in a satirical manner

 Later, when the contracts of the forests were snatched from him, he composed the Chandrakanta novel by mixing his fantasies and the adventures of Aiyari with the backdrop of the same forests, hills and ruins of ancient historical buildings
 babu devkinandan khatri ne jab upanyaas likhnaa shuru kiya tha us jamaane main adhiktar log bhi urdu bhashaa bhashi hi the
 In such a situation, Khatri ji's main goal was to create such a way that Devanagari Hindi should be promoted

 Keeping this popularity in mind, he wrote a second novel "chandrakanta Santi", which was many times more interesting than "chandrakanta", furthering the same story

 The need was also felt that an illustrated and more authentic book be rewritten in which the Arabic words used by Dr

 But the original language of Dr

 The main two distinctions of the new are - the substance and synonym

 Synonymous synonyms are of four types - Rijusutra, Shabd, Samanirudh and Prabhu
 sabhi dravyaarthik nay vastu ke keval saamaanya ansh ko hi grahan karte hai
 Similarly, all synonyms take only a particular part of a new object
 falat: kisi bhi nay se saamaanya, vishesh evam ubhayatmak vastu kaa sacolyen grahan nahin hota
 The knowledge that the object is received in various forms is called proof in the sense of "prama" and the means of that knowledge in the sense of "pramakaran"

 The name of the proof that the object is taken in vivid form is "direct" and the name of the proof which is received in vague form is "indirect"
 pratyaksh ke do bhed hai- saanvyaavhaarik or parmaarthik

 In Jain justice, the plaintiff is not considered victorious simply by mute the defendant in any way, but when he dismisses the defendant's opposing arguments and establishes the evidence on his side, he is deemed victorious
 jain nyaay main vaidic nyaay yaa buddha nyaay ke samaan nyayavakyon kii koi niyat sankhya nahin maani gai he, kintu use pratipaadya purush kii yogyata par nirbhar kiya gaya he
 Therefore, according to the situation in this opinion, the justification for the use of justices one to five is valid
 jain nyaay main kisi hetu kii saddhetuta ke liye use pakshasatv, sapakshasatv, vipakshastva, asatpratipakshatv or abadhitatv-in paanch roopon se athwa aadi ke teen roopon se sampann hona aavashyak nahin; balki sandhya kaa avinabhavi maatr hona aavashyak he
 In the Shwetambara tradition of Jain justice, there are only three distinctions of fallacy - against the imperfect and the adulterers; But in the Digambar tradition "akichintkar" has been reduced to four

 Open source software has a different relationship with intellectual property rights, so its importance cannot be denied
 ho saktaa he ki aane vaale kal main, soochna prodyogiki kii disha isi par nirbhar kare
 That is why it is absolutely necessary to know open source software, understand its importance, and assimilate the relationship with it and intellectual property rights
 aap yah bhi na sonche ki open sorce software keval computer vaigyanikon ke liye he par aam vyakti ke liye nahin he
 It could have been fine a few years ago, but not today
 main koi computer vaigyanik nahin hum par mere computer main koi bhi malikana software nahin he
 In today's open source software, doing all the work done at the office, writing, going to the internet, giving different types of powerpoint presentation, listening to songs, watching dvds, blogging, or anything else that we all want to do Is as simple as proprietary software
 The best thing is that there is no problem of intellectual property rights and there is no question of committing the common man from spending money and theft of software
 is lekh ko samajhane ke liye kamputer gyaan kii aavashyaktaa nahin he yah lekh vastav main aam vyakti ke liye he
 With open source software, it wants to draw your attention to the legal issues related to it, which we are not paying attention to, lest it should be too late when we think of attention
 So if you are not related to computer science, then you should not think that this article is not for you
 aap yah bhi na sonche ki yah aapke samaj main nahin aayegaa| main computer par kaam to karata hum par computer vaigyanik nahin hum, na hi mujhe computer ke bare main koi jaankaree he
 There is nothing in this article that a common person cannot understand

 haalanki free software se bhi paisa kamaaya ja saktaa he lekin uskaa tarika kuch alag he, parantu free software par kuch aisa thappa lag gaya ki vyapaaree varg un duusare tareekon ko bhi apnaane se dur rahane lage
 In 1997, enthusiasts in free software held a meeting in San Francisco and formed a public corporation called Open Source Initiative

 It also has its own logo which includes OSI software
 'S logo is printed which means that it is open source software
 kuch lokapriy opensorce software nimna hai- 1
 Operating system is software which brings the hardware of a computer and runs a computer
 There are mainly three types of operating systems
 vindos kii tarah ke: yah duniya main sabase zyada lokapriy he Like Unix: There are many types of operating systems, the most popular of these is Linux
 iskaa graphical interphes vindos kii tarah kaa he parantu donon main takanic kii bhinnata he
 Mac / aus Kind of: The personal computer was started from these and it is the easiest to run
 apane desh main to nahin, par baahar ke deshon main zyada lokapriy he

 We will discuss this in detail sometime, but only now that most of the forms of Unix are open source software
 linaks open sorce saftware he or ji

 Solaris is also a Unix-based operating system
 yah pehle san mikro-system kaa malikana saftver tha par janvari 2005 se yah open sorce saftware ho gaya he or CDDL ke andargat prakashit kiya gaya he

 It runs on both Linux and Windows

 Sunbird is an e-manager similar to Microsoftoft Outlook

 Apache: This is the most popular software for web servers
 yadi aap vindos main kaam karte hai tathaa linaks par jane kii baat sochate hai to aap open aphis daat aurg, firefox, thanderbard, sanbird or jimp par kaam karke dekhen| When we are talking about open source software, then let us talk about the three acronyms that are used in this regard
 FOSS / FLOSS: free software, open sorce software he par har open sorce software, free software nahin he
 GPL for free software Must be published under license, but open source software can also be published under many other types of licenses
 donon main antar to he par sambandh bhi gaharaa he
 All this has started with free software, so such software is called Free Open Source Software or FOSS for short
 yahaan free shabd kaa arth swatantraaa se he par free shabd kaa arth bina paise ke bhi hota he isaliye free shabd kaa prayog kuch chakkar main daal detaa he
 There are two different words in the French language Gratis which means Libre without money which means freedom, so people often use Free / Libre Open Source Software or FLOSS
 LAMP: open sorce software ke chaar mukhya stambh hai: linuxappachemysqlpython, Perl, PHP ityadi Linux and Apache have already been discussed
 mysql ek data-base prabandh karne kaa program he
 Python, Perl, PHP, etc
 are computer languages for scripting and writing programs
 aane vaala kal ho saktaa he ki isi LAMP se ujjwalit ho isaliye open sorce software ko kinare na kijiye, dhyaan main rakhiye| Linus Torvalds, who is the originator of Linux, has written his biography with David Diamond
 iskaa naam he 'just for Fun: the Story of an Accidental Revolutionaryâ| yah bahut acchhee pustak he tathaa ise padhne se jivan main aage badhane kii prerana milti he vah is pustak main open sorce software ke bare main kehete hai, 'the GPL and open source model allows for the creation of the best technology
 


 It also prevents the hoarding of technology and ensures that anyone with interest will not be excluded from its development
 


so open source would rather use the legal weapon of copyright as an invitation to join in the fun, rather than as a weapon against others
 Itâs still the same old mantra: Make Love, Not War, except on a slightly more abstract level
 


 Imagine an intellectual property law that actually took other people's rights into account, too
 Imagine IP laws that encouraged openness and sharing
 Laws that say sure, you can still have your secrets, whether they be technological or religious, but that does not mandate legal protection for such secrecy
 ' jab ham log baat open software main kuch phaayde ke bare main kar rahe he to bahut acha hoga ki kuch doosraa paksh bhi dekhen| bill gates, vindos ke janmdata hai
 He has written the book 'the Road Ahead'
 yah pustak bhi bahut acchhee he
 According to its name, it tells which side of information technology will go in future
 Many difficult questions are explained very easily in this
 isamen ve free software kii kamiyon ko is tarah se varnan karte hai, 'in addition to free information, there's a lot of free software on the Internet today, some of it quite useful
 Sometimes it's commercial software given away as part of a marketing campaign
 Other times the software has been written as a graduate student project or at a government-funded lab
 But i think consumer desire for quality, support, and comprehensiveness in important software applications means that the demand for commercial software will continue to grow
 Already many of the students and faculty members who wrote free software at their universities are busy writing business plans for start-up companies that will provide commercial versions of their software with more features, not to mention customer support and maintenance
 ' yah to kahana mushkil he ki software udyog kis taraf jaayegaa parantu duniya ke bahut saare desh tathaa vyapaar gharaane open sorce software ko apana hissaa bana rahe hai
 We are currently at a crossroads and are in a position to give a new twist to information technology

 ' Dwivedi ji has adopted this style in discussing serious literary subjects

 The first form is found in those articles which have been written to convince the public about a controversial topic
 isamen vaakya chote-chote hai
 Language is simple

 The sentences in it are relatively long
