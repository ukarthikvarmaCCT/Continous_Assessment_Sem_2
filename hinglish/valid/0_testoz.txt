 aadi-dravid bhashaa dravidiyan bhashaaon kaa aadi rup tha
 Adi languages are, by definition, envisaged languages, which have been reconstructed by linguists and hence historical records of any accustomed language are not available
 proto-dravidiyan ke maamle main bhi kuch aisa hi he
 Due to the lack of comparative linguistic research in Dravidian languages, more details about the grammar, era, or place of proto-dravidian are not known
 aisa mana jaataa he ki 500 isa purv ke aas paas proto-uttari dravidiyan, proto-kendriya dravidiyan or proto-dakshini dravidiyan ke bich vibhedan hua
 However some linguists argue that the degree of differentiation between its subclasses indicates an early division
 vid shabd vigyaan kaa shabd kosh sabhi dravid bhashaaon kii ekmaatr pustak he, isamen proto-dravidiyan shabdon kii ek suchi he, jinke bare main isse zyada koi spashtikaran uplabdh nahin he; isliye ek pratibhashali bhashavid ke liye proto-dravidiyan kaaphi sambhaavnaaen prastut karti he
 Here we will discuss the intuitive features of the reconstructed proto-dravidian language
 swar : proto dravidiyan main paanch laghu or paanch deergh swar hai: *a, *ā, *i, *ī, *u, *ū, *e, *ē, *o, *ō 
 anukram *ai or *au ko *ay or *av mana jaataa he
 Cuisine: Proto Dravidian is reconstructed with the following consonants: vatsarya band dhwani*ṯ kai putree bhashaaon main vatsarya tril ke rup main viksit hota he
 The / r / off sound is still found in Kota and Toda
 The original closed sound is still found in repetition in Malayalam
 Old Tamil has a clearly pronounced vowel like other closed sounds
 anya shabdon main, *ṯ bina spasht swar ke antim shabd ke rup main viksit nahin hui 
 The rhinoceros nasal developed in * ṅ Proto Dravidian before * k
 Hence it is not considered a distinct pronunciation in the Adya Dravidian
 haalanki, mul anukram *ṅk se *ṅ ke sarleekaran ke kaaran malayalam, gondi, konda or pengo bhashaaon main iske uccharan kii sthiti abhi bhi bani hui he
 Laryantramukhi fricativ * h ko Bh
 Has been proposed by krishnamurthi puraani tamil aayatam or anya dravidiyan tulanaatmak swaron kaa lekhajokha dete hue 
 Dravidian languages have been found mainly in southern India since the beginning of the Common Era
 atakalon ke anusaar dravidiyan bhashaaon kaa janm kumari condom naamak ek puranic mahadweep main hua, yaa academik kshetra main bade paimaane par mana jaataa he ki inkaa janm sindhu ghati sabhyataa main hua tha
 The similarity of Dravidian languages with Brahui, a language spoken in Balochistan, Pakistan — which was once a part of the Indus Valley — is evident
 iravatham mahadevan jinhen tamil or sanskrit donon bhashaaon kaa gyaan he, ne kai dashakon tak ivisi lipi par adhyayan kiya, unhone 1998 main ek saakshaatkaar main kaha ki ivisi lipi kaa arth ab tak spasht nahin hua he
 According to Michael Witzel, there are not many Dravidian words even in the early stages of the Vedas, even it can be said that the influence of the Dravidians increased rapidly in the post-rigvedic period
 Professor Vitzel in the essay "substrate Languages in Old indo-aryan" states, "because we cannot recognize the Dravidian influence on early rvs, it means that the language of the pre-rigvedic Indus civilization, at least in the punjab-austro- It was of Asiatic nature
 vitazel rugveda main koi purna austro-aciatic shabd dekh na sakaa or uski pathan shastreey vaadon se nahin kiya gaya he

 Socialization is the process through which a person learns various behaviors, customs, activities, etc
 of society
 jaivik astitv se saamaajik astitv main manushya kaa roopantaran bhi samajikaran ke madhyam se hi hota he
 It is through socialization that he assimilates culture
 samajikaran kii prakriya manushya kaa samskruti ke bhautik va a-bhautik roopon se parichay karaati he
 This process of learning is subject to the rules of society
 samajashaastra kii bhashaa main kahen to samaaj main apni paristhiti yaa darje ke bodh or uske anuroop bhoomika nibhaane kii vidhi ko ham samajikaran ke zariye hi aatmsaat karte hai
 Socialization makes a person socially active
 isi ke madhyam se samskruti ke anuroop aacharan karne kaa vivek viksit hota he
 For this, the cultural values practiced by the individual are the form of socialization
 par samajikaran ke vishleshan or adhyayan main is baat kaa dhyaan rakhana chahie ki seekhney kii prakriya main saamaajik mandandon va samskruti kii sabase zyaada ahmiyat hoti he
 What is learned by denying them, such as murder, theft, or other criminal acts, is not counted in socialization, but in counterattack behavior
 inhen seekhney vaala vyakti samaaj kii mukhyadhara ke vipareet mana jaataa he
 He is also not in a state to make positive contribution to the society
 in nakaaratmak kriyaaon or aacharnon ko praayah vifal samajikaran ke udhaaharan kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 In this way, socialization enables a person to participate in the activities of society by making him a functional member of society
 samajikaran kii ek sabase mahatvapurn visheshta yah he ki yah jivan-paryant chalane vaali prakriya he
 a person's circumstances and social roles change and he has to learn new patterns of behavior and behavior to behave accordingly
 udhaaharan ke liye bachapan main jahaan baccha samajikaran ke madhyam se mata-pita, sambandhiyon va buzurgon se vyavhaar karnaa sikhta he, vahiin yuvavastha main use naye sire se daftar main apane sahyogiyon, varishton, padosiyon aadi se vyavhaar ke taur-tareekon ko siikhnaa padataa he
 Even in old age, a person adopts related social behavior according to new role expectations
 is prakaar samajikaran vah prakriya he jo janm se lekar mrityu tak lagaataar chalati rahati he
 The social and cultural values learned in socialization are relative to time
 isliye samajikaran kii prakriya bhi desh-kaal saapeksh hoti he
 For example, in some tribal castes, the emphasis is on giving arms training to children and providing formal education to children in urban societies
 bharat jaise jati-bhed aadhaarit samaaj main jatigat peshon tathaa karmkand sthiti ke anusaar bhi samajikaran hota rahaa he
 Such as the practice of preparing children of lower caste for agriculture, handicrafts and manual labor, whereas Brahmin children were provided education
 vishwa ke alag-alag bhaagon kii samskritiyon main kaafii bhinnata he, isliye samajikaran sthaan saapeksh he
 It is relative to the time period that in Indian society in the past, it was the ideal behavior for women to veil, blush and speak softly
 jabaki aaj stri-purush barabari ke yug main striyon se is tarah ke saamaajik vyavhaar kii adhik apeksha nahin kii jaati
 Earlier children were taught step-touch education, whereas today they boy-boy
 yani mulyon va vikaas ke pattern main badlaav ne samajikaran kii vidhi ko bhi badal diya he
 Sociologists have divided the entire process of socialization into two parts: primary socialization and secondary socialization
 yah vibhaajan samaaj ke praathmik va dwitiyak sansthaaon ke vibhaajan par aadhaarit he
 Primary socialization occurs through family, neighborhood and kinship, friend groups and early schooling in which the child learns a lot about becoming a participating member of society
 parivaar ko saarvbhaum maan kar samajikaran main ise aadharbhoot sanstha ke rup main dekha jaataa he
 Under this, qualities of cooperation, sympathy, support and exchange are developed
 bhai-bahanon kaa prem, bado ke pyaar tathaa niyantran kii vyakti ke samajikaran main khaas bhoomika hoti he
 Secondary socialization begins with adolescence in which the individual learns to behave according to the needs of a more formal environment
 is avasthaa main college-vishvavidhyalay, raajnneetik sansthaayen, bazaar va dukaan jaisi aarthik sansthaayen, saanskrithik sansthaayen, daftar va factry jaise vyavsaay-samooh aadi ko samaaj kaa prakaaryaatmak sadsy banane main madad karte hai
 Socialization also provides the right solution to the problem of social control
 saamaajik niyantran main mushkil tab aati he jab log saamaajik mandandon ke anusaar vyavhaar nahin karte
 By socialization, all members of society behave in the same social situation and balance, peace and harmony is maintained in the society
 samajikaran ke antargat vi-samajikaran jaise pratyay kaa prayog bhi kiya jaataa he
 This means that those who have learned to conduct anti-socialism under the influence of negative socialization should be discouraged to conduct this type of conduct
 udhaaharan ke liye kisi aapraadhik charitra ke vyakti ko dand dekar yaa samajha- bujhaakar aparaadhon se mukt kara diya jaae to vah uske liye ek prakaar se vi-samajikaran hoga
 De-socialization is also seen in such a way that one forgets the earlier teachings such as the behavior of the elderly, such as touching the feet, doing havan-puja and not eating meat
 ise siikhe hue vyavhaar kii vi-samajikaran kaha ja saktaa he
 Re-socialization is also a process in which changes in the lifestyle and thoughts of a person occur
 fuj kii seva main vyakti ko puri tarah se jivan kii nayi style kaa prashikshan milanaa, kisi apradhi ko sakaaratmak vichaaron kii ore aakrisht karnaa, vivahoparaant stri kaa bhinn jivan-style vaale ghar ke anusaar swayan ko dhaalnaa isi punrsamajikaran ke udhaaharan hai
 Various thinkers and sociologists have tried to explain socialization on the basis of principles, including G
H
 Mead, Charles Cooley, Emile Durkheim are the main ones
 mid ne mukhya rup se samanyikrut anya kii dharna ko aadhaar banaaya he
 In this, a child and adult internalize the thoughts and expectations of others with respect to themselves
 balyajivan main koi baccha dusron ke kaamon kii kalpana karke uske zariye swayan ko dekhtaa he
 In this way he determines his authority from a social point of view
 charles kule ne apane siddhant kii vyakhya darpan main aatmadarshan ke aadhaar par kii he
 According to Coole, the status of a child is determined by three stages
 pehla, vah jaananaa chahta he ki duusare mere bare main kya sochate hai
 Second, he tries to understand the thinking about himself in terms of the opinions of others
 teesraa, vah apane bare main sochate hue apane ko acha yaa bura, shreshth yaa hin samajhane lagata he
 The main proposition of Kule is that a person makes a perception of himself in a long process and this perception is formed with the help of others
 durkhime ne samajikaran ko saamaajik tathy or samuhik pratinidhaan ke madhyam se samajhane kii koshish kii he
 According to him, the social facts, values, norms, collective beliefs etc
 of society are above the individual
 vyakti ko janm se inaki viraasat milti he
 Their creation is the individual's alone ikai ke haathon na hokar samooh dwaara banaaye hoti he
 They are outside the person and also impose compulsion on him
 is prakaar vyakti samajikaran ke rup main in samuhik pratinidhaanon ko aatmsaat karte hue samaaj kii sakriy tathaa upyogi ikai banataa he jisase samaaj main ekta bhi bani rahati he

 Bhartendu learned Sanskrit, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi, Urdu languages from Swadhyay
 unako kavy-pratibha apane pita se viraasat ke rup main mili thi
 He narrated to his father by making the following couplet at the age of five years and received the blessings of being a poet
 dhan ke atyadhik vyay se bhaaratendu ji rini ban gaye or duschintaaon ke kaaran unka sharir shithil hota gaya
 As a result, he died in 1885 at an early age
 bharatendu ke vrahat saahitiyik yogadan ke kaaran hi 1857 se 1900 tak ke kaal ko bharatendu yug ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to Acharya Ramchandra Shukla, pandrah varsh kii avasthaa se hi bhaaratendu ne sahitya seva prarambh kar di thi
 At the age of eighteen, he brought out a magazine called 'kavikavasudha', in which the writings of the great scholars of that time were printed
 ve bees varsh kii avasthaa main onreri magistrate banaae gaye or aadhunik hindi sahitya ke janak ke rup me pratishthit hue
 She published 'kavikavasudha' in 1868, 'harishchandra Magazine' in 1873 and 'bala Bodhini' for women's education in 1874

 hindi sahitya ko bharatendu kii dein bhashaa tathaa sahitya donon hi kshetron main he
 In the field of language, he distinguished the form of Khadi dialect which is different from Urdu and has been enhanced by taking the juice of the dialects of Hindi region

 He considered it his duty to help the afflicted, literate and friends
 pramukh nibandh Amazing dream ek kahani- kuch aapbeetee, kuch jagabiti It was the specialty of Bharatendu ji that where he wrote poems on ancient subjects like devotion to God, he also adopted new subjects like social reform, national love etc
 bhaaratendu kii rachanaaon main angreji shashan kaa virodh, swatantraaa ke liye uddaam aakanksha or jaateey bhavabodh kii jhalak milti he
 It was a new thing at that time to try to organize people for the spread of modern consciousness in a society stuck in feudal tightness
 unke sahitya or naveen vichaaron ne us samay ke tamaam sahityakaron or buddhijiviyon ko jhakzora or unke ird-gird rashtriya bhaawanaaon se ot-prot lekhakon kaa ek aisa samooh ban gaya jise bharatendu mandal ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 According to the subject, his poem is Shringar-dominated, Bhakti-dominated, social problem-oriented and national love-oriented
 shringaar ras pradhanbharatendu ji ne shringaar ke sanyog or viyog donon hi pakshon kaa sundar chithran kiya he
 See a picture of disconnection- bhakthi pradhanbharatendu ji krishna ke bhakt the or pushti maarg ke maanane vaale the
 He has a vision of true devotional spirit in the poem
 ve kaamana karte hai - Social problem Pradhan Bhartendu ji depicted many social problems in his poetry

 They did not leave even the moneylenders and the bribe takers - raashtra-prem pradhanbharatendu ji ke kavy main raashtra-prem bhi bhaavana spasht drushtigochar hoti he
 They present the tableau of India's ancient glory in these words - prakritik chitranprakruti chithran main bhaaratendu ji ko adhik safalataa nahin mili, kyonki ve maanav-prakruti ke shilpi the, bahya prakruti main unka marmpurna roopen nahin ram paaya
 Hence, most of his nature depiction lacks the power to attract the human heart
