 Probably no other class of medicines proved more beneficial than the drugs of this class in medicine
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki inaki sahaayta se anek jaane bachaai ja sakati hai
 The duration of the disease can be reduced considerably and arrangements can be made to prevent some diseases
 san 1908 main pi
 gaylemo ne para-amino benzin salphonamide kaa sanshleshan ranjak udyog main ek dravya ke liye kiya tha or isaki sahaayta se kuch azo ranjak banaae gaye
 It was later discovered that these dyes also have some antibacterial effect, but little attention was paid to this
 san 1932 main germany main fretz mitzah tathaa jojeff clerr ne praantosil tathaa anya salphonamide yukt aijo ranjakon kaa patent karaayaa or san 1935 main gerheart dom ne apane ek shodh-niabandh dwaara yah ghoshnaa kii ki usne praantosil kaa upyog chuhon main stryptococas sankraman kii chikitsa ke liye kiya tathaa yah gyaat kiya ki praantosil kii jeev-vishaaktata bahut kam he or stryptococas se sankramit chuhon par iske upyog se unki mrityu honi ruk gai yaa kam ho gai
 Later, using this on rabbits also yielded the same fruits

85 devdahana bharat ke uttar pradesh rajya ke elahabaad jile ke handiya prakhand main sthit ek gaanv he
 Soil is composed of coarse, medium and finely organic and inorganic mixed particles on the earth's upper surface
 upree sataha par se mitti hataane par praaia: chattan pai jaati he
 Sometimes the rock is found at a slight depth
 'mrudaa vigyaan' bhautik bhugol kii ek pramukh shakha he jisamen mrudaa ke nirmaan, uski visheshtaon evam dharaatal par uske vitaran kaa vaigyanik adhyayan kiya jaataa hai
 Only the particles on the top surface of the earth are called soil nadiyon ke kinare tathaa pani ke bahaav se laai gai mitti jisko 'kachaar mitti' kehete hai, khodne par chattan nahin milti
 There is a source of water in the lower level
 sabhi mittiyon kii utpatti chattan se hui he
 Where nature did not manipulate the soil and the climate did not have much effect, it is possible that we could establish a gradual relationship of the soil with the rocks below
 yadhyapi upar kii sataha kii mitti kaa rang-rup neeche kii chattan se bilkul bhinn he, phir bhi donon main rasinic sambandh rahata he or yadi prakritik kriya dwaara, arthath jal dwaara bahaakar, athwa vaayu dwaara udaakar, duusare sthal se mitti nahin laai gai he, tab yah sambandh purna rup se sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 a layer above the rock can also be found that is formed from the rock itself and has not yet come into full soil by natural action, only thick pieces of rock have been formed, which can neither be called soil
 Are and not rock
 inhen kii upree sataha main mitti kii banaavat pai jaati he
 In this level of soil, we can find the accumulation of chemical and physical properties of the rock below
 yadi chattan crystalia he, to isaki sambhaavna shat pratishat pakki he
 The very proximal, lateral part of the rock below may have similar chemical and physical properties as the rock
 jaise-jaise upar kii ore duuri badhati jaaegi chattan kii ruparekha bhi badalati jaaegi
 In the end, we find the soil, which has proved to be very favorable for agriculture and on which agriculture has been going on since the beginning and man has been producing crops
 koi-koi mitti duusari jagah kii chattaanon se banakar prakritik kaarnon se aa jaati he
 In such places it is unlikely that the physical and chemical relationship of the soil above is established by the accumulation of the bottom, but it is certain that the soil originated from rocks
 kheton kii mitti main chattaanon ke khanijon ke saath-saath, ped paudhon ke sadane se, carbonic padaarth bhi paae jate hai
 The microscopic and chemical analysis shows that the wear and tear of rocks is slowly due to the effects of chemical substances found in nature
 chattaanon ke rasinic avyav badal jate hai or mitti kii ruparekha bilkul bhinn prathit hoti he
 If weeding the rock was a major activity in the formation of soil, then today we do not find the soil of fields suitable for growing plants
 mitti kii tulana pisi hui baarik chattan se nahin kii ja sakati
 Although the minerals of the rocks are found very much in the upper part of the soil and their fragments are also present in large quantities, the animal continues to have animal activities, which have proved important for agriculture
 jeevajantu tathaa unase sambandh rakhanevaale padaartho ke, jaise ped paudhon kii sadi hui vastuon or sade hue jeev jantuon ke, prabhaav se kalil avasthaa main praapt chattaanon ke chote chote kanon par pratikriya hoti rahati he or mitti kaa rang rup badal jaataa he
 This form is not just the particles of rocks, the soil is equipped with a new system of earth
 ham sookshmdarshi se mitti ke ek tukade kii pariksha karen or phir usee yantra dwaara in chattaanon ke kanon kii pariksha karen to ham donon main jameen aasmaan kaa antar paavenge
 This difference is caused by a combination of inorganic materials that are obtained from animals and plants
 prakritik kriyaaon dwaara chattaanon kaa chote-chote kanon main parivartan hone se mitti ke banane main jo sahaayta hoti he, us kriya ko apkshay kehete hai
 This action is important and it is because of this that we find the soil on the earth favorable for agriculture
 is kriya main jal, hawa main sthit oxigen, carbon dioxide, jeevanuon tathaa anya amleey rasinic dravyon se bahut sahaayta milti he
 It is believed that the soil on which natural action takes place, the water falls and the air and sunlight are in contact, it takes a form in a few years to form a variety of different color and quality soils below it
 They become staves
 yadi ham mitti kii upree sataha par 10 yaa 12 foot gaharaa gaddha khoden or mitti ke parshv kaa avlokan karen, to hamen niyamit rup se kai bhinn rup rang, rachana kii mitti ek str se duusare str tak milti jaaegi
 Scientists have considered only three major levels of it and they have also described for what reasons and under what circumstances
 jal mitti ke upree sanstar par se hote hue or bahut se rasinic dravyon ko lete hue neeche ke sanstar main jaataa he or vahaan mitti ke saath milakar anek rasinic kriyaaon dwaara mitti ke rang rup ko badal detaa he
 In this way, the matter comes from the top and gets deposited in the bed below
 inamen ek he upree sanstar, jisamen se jal dwaara vilyan hokar dravya neeche kii ore jate hai, athwa avakshepan kriya dwaara neeche ke str main jamaa ho jate hai
 We call this upper bed
 doosraa vah sanstar he, jisamen upar varnan kii gai kriya dwaara dravya aakar jamaa hote hai ise sanstar kehete hai
 The third stratum is below it, in which the soil above it is formed, it is called stratum
 is sanstar ko duusare shabdon main paitruk sanstar bhi kaha jaataa he
 This name is meaningful because the soil above this bed has originated
 is sanstar main chattan or usase bane bade-bade malbe paae jate hai
 Each bed contains different levels
 sanstaron kaa krambaddh sambandh dikhalaanaa ati kathin samasya he
 This problem was first solved by Russian scientists
 sabase kathin samasya tab prakat hoti he jab mitti ke upree sanstar kaa kuch ansh apradan dwaara cat jaataa he
 Sometimes the entire bed is eroded and the bed remains
 in sanstaron ke aantarik sambandh par jis vigyaan ke kshetra main anusandhan hota he, use mrudavigyaan kehete hai
 This science helps in the classification of soil
 yah aadhunik vigyaan he or isaki uttarotar unnati hoti ja rahi he
 It has now been proved that agriculture cannot be benefited only by knowing the physical and chemical properties of the top surface of the soil
 paudhon kii badhati ko jaanane ke liye tathaa krishakon ko salaah dene ke liye yah aavashyak he ki mitti ke vibhinn sanstaron ke bhautik or rasinic gun tathaa inkaa paraspar sambandh jaan liya jaay
 There are different types of particles in the soil
 inamen jo ausatan nune maatra ke kan hai, ve hi mitti ko urvara banane ke liye aavashyak hai
 Due to these, the formation of soil-like structure is produced
 is rachana dwaara mitti main jal avasorana kii kriya bad jaati he tathaa paudhon ke liye anya vibhinn prakaar ke khaadya padaarth bhi avashoshit hote hai
 The physical properties of soil are dependent on soil composition, heat and mineral content of the soil
 mitti ke kan bhinn-bhinn aakaar prakaar ke, koi bade to koi chote or koi ati sookshm, hote hai
 Larger particles are fragments of small stones
 jaise jaise inpar prakritik kriyaayein hoti jaati hai, bade tukade chote hote jate hai or ant main baaluu, silt, chikani mitti athwa domat mitti ke aakaar ke ho jate hai
 Larger soil particles are found in most sandy soils and smaller sized particles are found in Matiyar soils
 inhen donon aakaar ke kanon ke mishran se bhinn-bhinn prakaar kii mittiyaan banati hai or unke bhinn-bhinn bhautik gun bhi hua karte hai
 The physical properties of the soil are very closely related to agricultural science
 mitti ke kuch bhautik gun, jaise aapekshik gurutv, kanvinyas, kan aakaar,, mitti kii sughatyata or sansanjan, rang, bhaar kanantarik chhidr, samooh aadi mahatv ke hai, mitti kaa aapekshik gurutv do prakaar kaa, ek abhaasi or doosraa nirpeksh hota he
 Virtual relative gravity is achieved by the inclusion of water and air in the inner part of the soil, that is, the gravity of water and air mixed with the mineral located inside the soil
 isaliye is gurutv kii maatra nirpeksh aapekshik gurutv se kam hoti he
 This is the ratio between the weight of dry soil with a known volume and the weight of water with the same volume
 yah 1
40 se 1
68 tak hota he
 The clay and silt particles are very small and light, so they do not condense with each other
 aisi mitti kaa bhaar kam hota he
 To know the weight of soil, loam and silt, it is made dry, because different types of soil have different types of moisture
 nirpeksh aapekshik gurutv mitti ke un bhaagon se sambandh rakhata he jo khanij tatv he
 Because of this its value is high
 nirpeksh aapekshik gurutv 1
4 se 2
6 ke bich main hota he
 Clay particles form clusters
 bhinn-bhinn samooh bhinn-bhinn prakaar kii mitti utpann karte hai
 These particles are mixed with each other in different ways and their interaction is firm and orderly
 kan kisi bhi rup or aakaar ke ho sakate hai
 Soil fertility is dependent on the configuration of the particles
 paudhon ko hawa or pani kii aavashyaktaa hoti he or hawa tathaa pani kaa mitti main rahanaa kanon ke vinyas par nirbhar he
 These particle groups are- ho sakate hai
 Particle size also has an effect on other physical properties of the soil
 bade aakaar ke kanonvali mitti ke kanantarik chhidr bade hote hai
 In such soil, water flows down with great intensity, due to which there is always a lack of moisture
 aisi mitti main sheeghra garam or thanda ho jane kaa gun rahata he tathaa aisi mitti oosar hoti he
 Small mottled soils, especially clay soils, have opposite properties
 mitti ke saath jal ke milane se The presence of organic matter also leads to soil solubility
 chote-chote kanon ke kaaran sughatyata badhati he
 Eitberg has stated four stages of solubility, which depend on the amount of water
 mitti ke vibhinn kanon par ek duusare se vidyut shakti dwaara khinchaav utpann hota he, jise sansanjan kehete hai
 Cogeneration and solubility are interrelated
 ek ke adhik hone se doosraa bhi adhik ho jaataa he
 Soils have different colors
 kuch mittiyaan safed hoti he, kuch laal, kuch bhuri, kuch kaali tathaa kuch raakh ke rang kii
 Yellow soil is also found somewhere
 vibhinn dravyon kii upasthiti ke kaaran mitti main ye rang aa jate hai
 Climate of the soil also has an impact
 jahaan varsha adhik hoti he vahaan kii mitti rangeen hoti he
 Iron-clad soil is found in warm regions, whose color is brown and yellow
 louh ke oxikaran se yah rang praapt hota he
 The color of black soil is black due to the presence of organic matter and humus
 aisi mitti adhik varsha vaale sthanon main pai jaati he
 Most of the soil is made up of minerals
 aapekshik gurutv se bhaar kaa gyaan hota he
 The soil becomes light due to excess of organic matter and fossils
 mitti ke kanon ke bich kuch jagah chhuti rahati he
 These places are called particulate holes
 yah kanon ke vinyas par nirbhar karata he
 By this, the percentage of pores volume can be detected, but the shape and form of the holes is not known
 matiyaar mitti main kanantarik chhidr chote hote hai, jabaki balui mitti main ve bade hote hai
 This makes the soil soil absorb more water and the sand soil absorbs less
 pehle prakaar kii mitti keshikeey hoti he or duusare prakaar kii akeshikeey
 The soil holes have hydroelectric potential due to granular holes
 mitti kii sanrachana kanon kii sanrachana par nirbhar karti he
 Particles bind with electronegativity to form groups
 samoohon main bandh jane se bandhan or majboot ho jaataa he
 Iron and organic materials have a special hand in binding groups
 chote chote kanon ke milane se mridukan vinyas praapt hota he
 This results in more water stagnation and plowing is also more easily
 kanon ko maapkar unka vargeekaran kiya gaya he
 The measurements reveal a lot of soil properties and fertility
 yah vargeekaran antarrashtriya he: The measurement of these particles derives from a scientific equation called Stokes
 mitti main jal kaa bahut bada mahatv he
 This water is of four types: jab tak pani paryaapt rahata he, paudhe kii jad apana kaam karti rahati he
 Gradually, when the water gets depleted, then there is such a situation that the roots of the plant are unable to absorb water and the plants start drying up
 aisi avasthaa main mitti main jal bahut kam rahata he or usko mitti se preshit karne ke liye adhik maatra main shakti kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 In such a state, the water which is in the soil, it is called Mlaganigank
 isaki upyogita adhik he, kyoki isse mitti ke colloid padaarth kii maatra gyaat hoti he
 Apart from this, it also gives knowledge of the amount of inert water
 us adhiktam jal ko, jise mitti santrupt vayumandal ke kisi ek taap par avashoshit karti he, ardratagrahi gunank athwa ardrataavashoshi kshamta kehete hai
 Knowledge of hygienic coefficient is obtained as follows
 mitti main kanantarik chhidr rahete hai
 When there is no water in those holes, then air enters
 yah vaayu mitti main sthit jal main bhi vilyan kii avasthaa main pai jaati he
 This air contains oxygen and nitrogen as well as carbon dioxide
 oxigen paudhon kii jadon ke liye laabhadaayak he
 Carbon dioxide causes plant growth
 paudhon kii vruddhi mitti ke jal, vaayu or taap par nirbhar karti he
 There are five types of heat on the top surface of soil: mitti kii upree sataha par taap do prakaar se ghatata he: The temperature of the soil depends on its depth and climate
 gaharaai se ooshmaa badhati he
 The heat is high in summer and low in autumn
 libig ne 1840 i0 main pehle pahal yah siddhant sthapit kiya ki mitti main paudhon ko upjane ke liye acarbonic padaarthon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 After this, many research has been done on this subject and today we know for sure that the following elements in soil are required to be kept in a minimal amount: nitrogen, potacium, fosfaras, calcium, magnesium, sodium, carbon, oxigen or hydrogen
 Iron, sulfur, silica, chlorine manganese, zinc, nickel, cobalt molybdenum, copper, boron, and salinium
 nitrogen mitti main carbonic or acarbonic donon roopon main rahata he, acarbonic rup main nitrate or ammonia ke rup main
 Ammonia is produced by the decomposition of organic matter
 ammonia par jeevanuon kii kriya se pehle nitrite or peeche nitrate banate hai
 Enzymes are made from bacteria, which keep the soil decomposed
 phosphate epetic se aata he
 It is beneficial for flowers and fruits of plants
 potacium sulphate or carbonate ke rup main mitti main rahata he tathaa paudhon kii rasinic kriya main sahaayak hota he
 This keeps the leaves of plants healthy and increases protein and sugar levels
 calcium mitti main, phosphate, carbonate or sulphate ke rup main rahata he
 This makes the stems of plants strong
 yah mitti kii amlata ko kam karata he or usase paudhon ko laabh pahunchataa he
 Magnesium remains in the soil in the form of carbonate
 yah paudhon main chlorophyl ke banane main sahaayta pahunchaata he
 Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are obtained by organic matter and water in the soil
 paudhe mitti se ye tatv carbonate ke rup main pate hai, lekin adhikansh carbon paudhon ko vaayu dwaara praapt hota he
 Plants derive hydrogen and oxygen from soil as water
 sodium kshareey tatv he or mitti main sulphate tathaa carbonate ke rup main paaya jaataa he
 Iron is essential in the lower elements
 yah mitti main oxide ke rup main rahata he or chlorophyl ke banane main sahaayta pahunchaata he
 Sulfur remains in the soil as sulfate
 yah paudhon main protein ko badhaata he
 Chlorine is found in soil in the form of calcium, magnesium and sodium chloride
 yah tatv paudhon ke patton ko badhaata or motaa karata he
 Other elements help in the formation of flowers and fruits by balancing the actions of the plants
 mitti main anek jeevanu, keetanu or jeevajantu paae jate he, jo anek rasinic abhikriyaayein sampann kar mitti ke gun main parivartan karte hai
 Here is: mitti main jeevanuon kaa sthaan bade mahatv kaa he
 They change the physical properties of the soil and increase its fertility
 mitti main baarik kan kalil ke rup main rahete hai
 They exchange ions
 yah kriya paudhon kii jadon ko poshak dravya pahunchane main sahaayak hoti he
 Therefore, this action is of great importance
 kalil carbonic or acarbonic donon ho sakate hai
 These two are mutual
 acarbonic kalil alumina or silica ke yoga se banate hai
 The loan remains on the silica core
 ye dhan aayan kaa avasorana karte he
 Money ion is a nutrient
 carbonic kalil jal or poshak tatv kaa adhik avasorana karata he
 Kalil also absorbs negative ion
 mitti main amlata or kshariyata kalil se utpann hoti he
 When the alkaline element is more in the cell, alkalinity and hydrogen are more absorbed then acidity is produced
 amlata or kshariyata donon paudhon ke liye hanikaarak hai
 Acidity and alkalinity of plants are measured by the concentration of hydrogen ions
 ise piech dwaara prakat karte hai
 If the ph is 1 to 6, the soil is acidic and 7 to 8
5, then the saline soil is 8
5 to 14, then the soil is alkaline
 vibhinn piech par tatwon kaa avasorana vibhinn hota he
 Lime or gypsum is used to remove acidity
 mitti ke rasinic or bhautik vishleshan kiye jate hai
 Chemical analysis detects soil nutrients and physical analysis gives knowledge of the condition of soil particles
 rasinic vishleshan nitrogen, phosphate, potash or jal kii maatra nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 In 1879, Dok Shaiv first classified the soil and divided the soil into normal and unusual soil
 bharat kii mittiyaan sthool rup se paanch virgo main vibhajit kii gai he: The Indian Council of Agricultural Research has divided India's soil into eight groups: jal ko avashoshan karne kii kshamta sabase adhik domat mitti main hoti he
 The Central Soil Conservation Board was established in 1953 for soil conservation
 marusthal kii samasya ke adhyayan ke liye rajasthan ko jodhpur main anusandhan kendra banaaye gayi hai
 In terms of area, alluvial soil is found on the largest area in India
 bharat ke kul kshetrafal kaa lagbhag 40pratishat bhaag par jalodh mitti milte he
 Alluvial soil is formed by deposition of rivers
 jalodh mitti main nitrogen evam phosphorus kii maatra kam hoti he
 This is the reason that fertilizing urea in alluvial soil is necessary for crop production
 jalodh mitti main potash evam chuunaa kii paryaapt maatra hoti he
 In India, the plain of Sindh, the plains of Brahmaputra, the Godavari plain, the Cauvery plain, rivers are made of alluvial soil deposits
 jalodh kii mitti gehun ke fasal ke liye uttam mana jaataa he
 Apart from this, paddy and potato are also cultivated in it
 jalodh mitti kaa nirmaan balui mitti evam chikani mitti ke milane se hui he

 File transfer protocol is a network protocol through which files are exchanged over an Internet-based TCP / IP network
 ise upayokta aadhaarit kuta yaa anonimas yujar acces ke dwaara kaam main laayaa jaataa he
 Now with FTP servers in almost every institution, this system does not work
 anek haal ke web broujar or file prabandhak apatpi sarvaron se jud sakate hai
 This can do the same thing as local files on files coming from remote locations
 isamen apatpi yuarel prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 Other methods of sending files such as SFTP and SCP are not associated with FTP
 inaki puri prakriya main esaech kaa prayog hota he
 The File Transfer Protocol or FTP in its current form has arrived at various stages
 sarvapratham 16 april, 1971 main ise refsi 114 ke naam se taiyaar kiya gaya tha jise baad main june, 1980 main refsi 765 se badla gaya jise san aktubar 1985 main refsi 959 se parivartit kiya gaya
 After that, many security related changes came
 ye suraksha sambandhi badlaav isliye laae gaye the kyonki aarambh main sanchikaayen bhejne kaa yah tarika bahut asurakshit tha
 The main reason for this vulnerability was that anyone could steal or copy that file on the same network in the process of sending the file
 achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet se purv yah internet protocol ke kaaryakshetra main aane vaali ek aam samasya bani hui thi
 This problem was possible only through SFTP
 apatpi ko sakriy mod, niskriy mod or vistrut niskriy mod main sanchalit kiya ja saktaa he
 In September 1998 by RFC 2428, extended passive mode was added
 network par data antarit karte samay, kai data pratinidhitiv kiye ja sakate hai
 There are two most common transfer modes: FTP sarwar vaapasi code, apane bheetar ke ankon dwaara apni sthiti suchit karte hai
 The basic FTP specification is an inherently unsafe method of transferring files, as there is no specified method of transferring data in an encrypted manner
 iskaa arth yah he ki adhikansh network vinyason ke antargat, prayokta naam, password, afatipi cmand or antarit sanchikaayen, ek packet sansuchak ke upyog dwaara usee network par avasthit koi bhi antarit sanchikaon ko hathiyaa saktaa he
 This has been a common problem for many Internet protocol specifications written prior to the creation of SSL such as HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet
 is samasya ke liye aam samaadhaan he esaftipi, yaa apatpies, jo arefasi 4217 main vinirdisht tareeqe se afatipi main esasail yaa tles ancripshan jodate hai
 a host providing FTP service is additionally capable of providing anonymous FTP access
 prayokta naam ke liye puche jane par, prayokta saamaanya taur par 'anaam' khate kii seva main log-in karte hai
 Although users are generally asked to send their e-mail address in lieu of a password, little or no verification of the supplied information is done
 chunki aadhunik afatipi client aam taur par prayokta se anaam pravesh prakriya ko chhupate hai, afatipi client, password ke rup main nakli data kii aapurti kar sakate hai kyonki anuprayog ko prayokta kaa i-mail pataa gyaat nahin ho saktaa he
 The Gopher protocol, as well as the simple file transfer protocol and file service protocol, have been suggested as an alternative to anonymous FTP
 jahaan apatpi acces prayog main nahin aata, vahaan doorvarti yaa remote apatpi yaa apatpi mail prayog main laayaa jaataa he
 In this, an email is sent to another FTP server that completes the FTP command and sends back an attachment containing the download file
 yah khaskar vahaan prayog main laayaa jaataa he, jahaan FTP pahunch pratibandhit ho
 An e-mail containing the FTP command to be executed is sent to the remote FTP server
 yah ek mail sarwar hota he jo aavak i-mail ko pars karata he, afatipi commandon ko karyanvit karata he or atachament ke rup main downlod kiye gaye kisi sanchika ke saath i-mail waapas bhejtaa he
 This is obviously less flexible than an FTP client, as directories cannot be seen interacting or modifying commands, and replies may also have problems with large file attachments escaping through the mail server
 aajkal adhikansh internet prayoktaaon ke paas afatipi kaa pahunch sulabh he, atah yah prakriya dainandin upyog main prachlit nahin he
 Currently modern and recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers, although they may lack support for protocol extensions such as FTPS
 yah afatipi par doorvarti sanchikaon kii adla-badali main sthaneey sanchikaon ke liye prayukt interfes jaise madhyam ko anumat karata he
 This is done by an FTP URL
 yah is rup main hota he: Alternatively a password can be provided in the URL, eg: adhikansh web brouzaron ko niskriy mod afatipi kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, jisase puraa karne hetu sabhi afatipi sarwar sakasham nahin hai
 Some browsers only allow files to be downloaded, but do not provide any means to upload files to the server
 ypi pate or port cmand par port sankhyaon kaa pratinidhitiv or pieesavi uttar, network pataa anuwaad upkarnon ke liye FTP se nipatane main ek or chunauti he
 These values have to be changed by the NAT tool, so that they include the IP address of the nat-ed client and the port selected by the NAT device for the data connection
 nayaa pataa or port sambhawatah unke dashamalav pratinidhitiv kii lambaai main apane mul pate or port se alag hon
 This means that the value on the control connection must be carefully changed, with the NAT tool changing the TCP sequence and acknowledgment fields for all subsequent packets
 adhikansh NAT upkarnon main aam taur par is tarah ke anuwaad nahin kiye jate hai, balki is uddeshy ke liye vishesh anuprayog stareey get-ve uplabdh rahete hai
 FTP over SSH refers to the use of creating a normal FTP session container over an SSH connection
 afatipi ek se adhik tisipi conekshnon kaa upyog karata he, atev esaech par tunnel bananaa vishesh rup se kathin hota he
 As with many SSH clients, attempting to prepare the tunnel for the control channel would only protect the channel; When data is transferred, FTP software on both ends will establish TCP connections, which will pass over the SSH connection to the bypass, thus securing privacy, integrity protection, etc
 anyathaa, esaech client software ke liye afatipi protocol kaa vishisht gyaan or afatipi niyantran sandeshon kii nigaraanee or punarlekhan tathaa swytt rup se afatipi data channelon ke liye nae agreshan kholana aavashyak hota zaruri he
 Version 3 of SSH Communications Security's software parikar and FONC licensed by GPL are two software packages that support this mode
 SSH kii apeksha FTP ko kabhi-kabhi surakshit FTP ke rup main bhi sanderbhit kiya jaataa he; ise FTP surakshit karne kii SSL / TLS jaisi anya paddati nahin samajhnaa chahie
 Other methods of transferring files using SSH include SFTP and SCP, which are not related to FTP; In each of these, the entire conversation is always protected by the SSH protocol

 In many languages it is also known as Röntgen radiation, which is based on the name of its investigator Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen
 rontjan equalent maanav isaki shastreey maapak ikai he
 In 1895 X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Konrad Runtzen, a professor of physics at the University of Wurtzburg in Germany
 yadi kaanch kii nalika main se vaayu ko pump se kramash: nikaala jaae or usamen ucch vibhav kaa vidyudvisarjan kiya jaae, to daab ke paryaapt alp hone par vaayu swayan prakashit hone lagati he
 While conducting an experimental study of this phenomenon, Rantzen observed that when the air pressure was very low, the rays coming out of the sluice tube gave light to barium platinocyanide and, when the tube was completely covered with black paper Also, the manibh kept nearby keeps on shouting
 at: yah spasht tha ki visarjananalika ke baahar jo kirane aati hai ve kaale kaagaj main se sugamawa se paar ho sakati hai or barium platinosynide ke parade ko dhyutimaan karne kaa vishesh gun in kirnon main he
 Such rays were not yet known in science
 at: in nai avishkrut kirnon kaa naam 'eksrez' rakhaa gaya, kintu rantjan ke sammaan main, visheshat : germany main, in kirnon ko 'rantjan kirane' hi kaha jaataa he
 As soon as Rantzen's invention was published, the attention of the entire scientific world was attracted to X-ray
 apaardarshee thos padaartho main se paar hone kaa eksre kaa gundharm atyant mahatvapurn tha or is gundharm kaa upyog vigyaan ke anek vibhaagon main ho saktaa tha
 Therefore, efforts were made to produce X-rays and study their properties in many physics laboratories
 alp daab par vaayu main jo vidyut visarjan hota he, uske adhyayan kaa aadhunik bhautikee ke vikaas main ek vishesh sthaan he
 If by connecting a long glass tube with a vacuum pump, the inner air flows through a high voltage current, initially, when the pressure is high, no action is seen, but when the air pressure is reduced first Both are electronegative
 daab ko or kam karne par sampurna nalika dhyutimaan ho jaati he
 According to the interpretation of modern physics, the reason is that when electrons get energy and they move with the remaining air molecules while moving at high velocity towards the positive
 sanghaton ke kaaran anuon ke aayan banate hai or jab ye aayan purv avasthaa ko praapt hote hai tab prakaash kaa utsarjan hota he
 Due to the existence of ions, electrophoresis continues in the air
 daab ke atyant alp ho jane par electranon se sanghaat hone ke liye paryaapt anu nahin rahete; at: electron runagra se nikalakar apni sampurna urja se dhanagar se sidhe takaraate hai
 Due to these effects, the intense energy of electrons gets to the atoms of the cation and one result is the production of X-rays
 is paddati se eksre kaa utpaadan karne ke liye nalika main ek kranthik daab kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 If the air pressure is higher than this critical pressure, then there is not enough energy in the electrons to produce the x-ray
 duusari ore, yadi daab is kranthik daab se kam ho to electron utpann hi nahin hote, at: vidyudvisarjan hi band ho jaataa he
 Initially the X-ray was produced using a similar type of aerial and the air pressure was kept at a critical value of this critical pressure
 eksre ke do vishesh gundharm adhik mahatvapurn hai : There are three main methods of intensity measurement
 pratideept parade par eksre se jo dipti aati he uski tivrata-maryaadit dipti tak-eksre kii tivrata kii samaanupati hoti he
 The intensity of the x-ray can be broadly compared by estimating the intensity of fluorescence
 duusari vidhi main photo pattica ke upar eksre kii jo kriya hoti he, uskaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 The blackness that comes from the X-ray incident on the photo plate depends on the intensity of the X-ray and the time of incidence
 is paddati se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii tulana karne ke liye adhik tivrata ke eksre punj se photo pattica par maryaadit sthaan par kisi upyukt kaal tak kriya hone di jaati he or tatpashchaat usee pattica par kuch neeche duusare eksre punj kii kriya kaal t, 2t, 3t aadi tak hone di jaati he
 After developing the plaque, comparing the blackness of the two pictures gives a sense of the relative intensity of the two arms
 tivrathamapan kii teesri reeti adhik prachlit he, kyonki is reeti se tivrata thik thik maapi ja sakati he
 When the x-ray passes through the air, the air becomes electronegative and its conductivity depends on the intensity of the x-ray
 eksre kii kriya se vaayu ke anuon ke electron visthapit hote hai or aayan utpann hote hai
 In the presence of proper electrodepolarization, the electrons that can be obtained from ions can be measured with a sensory electronometer, or with other appropriate sensory devices
 eksre kii tivrata vidyuddhara kii samaanupati hoti he
 More recently, the use of multiplier-illuminant and x-ray sensing spurs has made intensity measurements extremely accessible
 usee prakaar, gaigagunak kii sahaayta se ynikaran kii dhara kaa maapan bhi sugamawa se ho saktaa he
 Therefore, measurement of intensity of X-rays by both these types of devices is more prevalent in present day
 tivrathamapan kii in teenon prachlit ritiyon se do eksre punjon kii tivrataon kii keval tulana hi ho sakati he, nirpeksh tivrata praapt nahin ho sakati
 In fact, we can call the intensity of the X-ray as the energy exerted per second on an area of one square centimeter perpendicular to the x-ray
 is tivrata ko arg prati varg centimetre prati senkad main vyakt karte hai
 In order to measure intensity as energy, the energy of the X-ray is very low because in this way intensely specific instruments are required for intensification
 is reeti se tivrathamapan kaa pratham prayaas terril ne kiya tha
 Subsequently, in 1953, Henderson, BT and Laffan of the University of Illinois in the United States also tried
 ati prachand vidyudvibhav se utpann eksre kii tivrata keval isi reeti se naapi ja sakati he
 Experimental work of physics always requires units and has its shape according to the measured amount
 eksre kii maatra ke ekak ko 'rantjan' kehete hai or vartmaan kaal main ek rantjan kii paribhaasha nimnlikhit prakaar se kii jaati he- Another special feature of X-rays is their solubility
 bhinn bhinn thos pindon kii samaan motaayiyon main se paar hone par eksre kii tivrata main jo kami hoti he vah samaan nahin hoti
 The absorption of X-rays is higher in some solids and less in some substances
 prayog dwaara yah fal praapt hua ki kisi thos vishesh kii bhinn bhinn motaayiyon main se yadi eksre paar jaae, to nirgat eksre ko tivrata, praarambhik tivrata or thos padaarth kii motaai, in teenon main nimnlikhit sameekaran ke anusaar sambandh rahata he : log = - m × thickness --- yahan = eksre kii praarambhik tivrata; i = intensity of x-ray after crossing through solid material; m = ek sthiraank, jisko 'avasorana gunak' kehete hai
 This constant is called that solid's special x-ray-absorption-multiplier
 vastut: yah rekhiy gunak he
 To express it broadly, it is divided into the density of that solid substance and thus the absorption coefficient obtained is called 'code-absorption-factor'
 at: mmass = m / density sanhati-avasorana-gunak kaa vishesh mahatv yah he ki vah avasorak padaarth kaa lakshanik gundharm he
 For example, the linear absorption-multiplier of water and steam is different, because water is liquid and steam is gas
 parantu jal tathaa bhaap kaa eksre sanhati-avasorana-gunank samaan hi hota he, kyonki jal tathaa bhaap ke rasinic sanrachak abhinn hai arthath hydrogen tathaa oxijan
 The variation of the properties of light and x-rays is very clear from the code-absorption-multiplier
 saadhaarant: drav or thos padaarth prakaash ke liye swayan apaardarshee athwa parbhasak hote hai
 Diamond is transparent and graphite opaque to light, but the codon-absorption-coefficient of X-ray remains the same for diamond and graphite, as these two materials are essentially different forms of carbon
 eksre nalika se jo sampurna eksre praapt hote hai, un sabakaa avasorana-gunak mukhyat: vidyudvibhav or avasorak parade kii dhaatu kaa parmaanu-kramank, in donon par nirbhar rahata he
 As the voltage increases, the penetration or hardness of the x-ray produced increases
 sameekaran se yah nishkarsh nikalataa he ki kisi ek thos padaarth ke liye avasorana gunak sab motaayiyon ke liye sthir rahegaa
 But in direct use, the low passable portion of radiation received from the x-ray tube is completely absorbed in the first levels of the absorber screen
 keval adhik praveshkshmata ke eksre avasorana parade ke antim staron tak pahunch pate hai
 It is clear that the absorption factor of the x-ray entering the absorption screen is higher than the absorption factor of the x-ray crossing the absorption screen
 jab samast eksre kaa avasorana gunak samaan hota he tab unako samang eksre kehete hai
 Thus the amount of X-rays is measured by their intensity and their characteristic by their absorption-multiplier
 jis padaarth se prakaash aata he us padaarth ko ham dekh sakate hai, kyonki prakaash kirnon kii ek kriya hamaari aankh ke roopaadhar par hoti he
 This type of action is not by X-ray, so X-rays are not visible
 itnaa hi nahin, aankhon par tathaa sharir ke anya angon par eksre kii kriya atyant hanikaarak hoti he
 Due to the action of X-rays on living cells for a sufficient period of time, they are reduced
 eksre sharir ke charm main se saralata se paar ho jate hai or bheetar ke jivit koshaaon par inaki paryaapt kaal tak kriya hone se unke mrit ho jane kii sambhaavna rahati he
 Again, X-ray effects are durable; Therefore, X-ray activity continues at different places at the same place of the body, and in some periods, cancer-like refractory diseases occur
 at: eksre kaa upyog karte samay atyant saavdhaanee se kaary karne kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 Special tools are used to protect the body
 iske atirikt eksre kaa nity upyog karanevaale vartmaan kaal main ek eksre-maatra-maapi apni jeb main rakhte hai, jisase pataa chalata he ki vikiran kii kitni maatra karmchaaree ke upar kaary kar chuki he
 This lethal property of X-rays is also used in other diseases; For example, if harmful pathogens grow in any part of the body, they can be destroyed by using X-rays on them
 eksre kaa ayurvigyaan main, visheshat: shalyakarm main, adhik upyog hota he
 The possibility of this type of use was evident from the time of X-ray's invention
 sharir ke bhinn-bhinn avyavon ke avasorana-gunak vibhinn hote hai; at: sharir ke kisi bhi bhaag main se eksre paar karke photo lene se asthiyaan tathaa anya ghatak pruthak pruthak dikhaai dete hai 
 Therefore, X-ray photographs are very useful before surgery, or to find out what condition the disease is in
 eksre ke utpaadan main pragati hone par unka upyog udyogon main bhi hone laga or vartmaan kaal main dhaatuvigyaan main eksre kaa upyog aavashyak ho gaya he
 Energy is either combined with particles or combined with waves
 kisi udgam se urja kaa visarjan hota ho to is urja kaa astitv saadhaarant: vidyucchambukiy tarangon kii tivrata main, athwa electron, proton, neutron, aayan ityadi kanon kii gatij urja ke rup main, vyakt hota he
 The patterns of wave and particle are different; Therefore, they are usually kept in different categories
 kintu anek prayogon ke falon se yah spasht ho gaya he ki in virgon kaa bandhan tarangon main kanon ke gun hai or, vilomat: kanon main bhi tarangon ke gun hai
 This duality form began with the principle of the heat of the Planck
 eksre ke gun bhi is dwait rup ke apwaad nahin hai
 X-rays have certain properties of waves and certain properties are also of particles
 pehle ham tarangeey gunon par vichaar karenge
 From the fruits of early experiments, it was clear that X-rays and light have properties comparable
 eksre tathaa prakaash kii kirnon kaa dik main saral rekhaon main prachaaran hota he
 Like light, the intensity of an x-ray is also inversely proportional to the square of the distance
 photo pattica par honevaali kriya tathaa gas main kiye gaye ynikaran ke gunon main bhi donon main samya he
 In 1905 AD, by experiment, Marx proved that the velocity of the x-ray is the same as the velocity of light — that is, 3 × 10 ° cm per second
 vaidyut tathaa chumbakeey kshetron main eksre aprabhavit rahete hai
 It was clear from all these properties that X-rays are electromagnetic in nature, not light charged particles
 bhed keval tarangadairghyo main ho saktaa he
 From the experiments of scientists such as Haga, Windt, Walters, Pol, Sommerfeld, etc
, it could be inferred that the wavelength of the x-ray was 1 × 10–8 cm
 Is near kintu pratham nirnayaatmak fal lave, freederish tathaa kniping ke prayogon se praapt hua or eksre kii tarangadairghy pramanit hui
 After this experiment, several attempts were made to clarify the wavelength of the X-ray and to obtain experimental results of other results in relation to it and to obtain experimental results of other dimensions with respect to it
 eksre kaa tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghy se bahut kam hone ke kaaran jin prayogon dwaara prakaash kaa tarangadairghy saralata se mapa ja saktaa he, vaise prayog eksre ke liye karne main anek kathinaaiyaan upasthit hoti hai
 However, in the present times, experiments like X-ray interference, diffraction, polarization, etc
 have been successful, and the wavelengths of the X-rays have been known to be as high as the optical waves
 jin prayogon se eksre kii tarangaprakruti pramanit hoti he unamem se kuch neeche die ja rahe hai- X-rays are particularly helpful in finding the crystalline structure
 chikitsiya upyogon ke alaava bhi eksre kaa anekon prakaar se upyog kiya jaataa he
 Due to the unique properties of X-rays, they are widely used in many branches of science and in various industries
 udyogon main, visheshat: nirmaan tathaa nirmit padaartho ke gunon ke niyantran main, eksre kaa bahut upyog hota he
 Intrinsic errors of manufactured materials can be easily detected by X-ray photographs
 vimaan tathaa usee prakaar ke sadhano ke yantron main ati teevr veg tathaa charam bhautik paristhitiyon kaa saamana karnaa padataa hai; aise yantron ke nirmaan main prayek avyav antarbahya nirdosh tathaa yatharth hona chahie
 Each such component is tested with an X-ray and the defective components are discarded
 dhaatu eksre kaa avasorana karte hai, at: dhaatuon ke antarbhaagon kii pariksha ke liye mridu eksre anupyukt hote hai
 Extremely high-voltage X-rays are required for large-sized metallic materials
 dhaatu vigyaan tathaa dhatugaveshna main eksre atyant upyogi hai
 Metals are also crystalline, but their crystals are fine and they are set up in the desired way, so the lave-statue of metals usually has a concentric circle
 prayek vartual ek samaan tivrata kaa hota he, kintu kisi bhautik kriya se kanon ke aakaaron main vruddhi ho jane par in vartualon main bindu bhi aate hai
 Therefore, by X-ray interference, it is known exactly what the particles of metallic particles are and how their shape is like
 is gyaan kaa dhaatuvigyaan main atyant mahatv he
 At the time of making metal materials, heat causes them to become insoluble
 dhaatu ko modane se bhi usamen antarvikruti ho jaati he
 Such distortions can be analyzed by X-ray
 is prakaar vishisht gunon se yukt nirdosh dhaatu praapt karne main eksre kaa vishesh upyog hota he
 Among other uses of X-rays, the X-ray microscope is notable
 eksre ke tarangadairghy prakaash ke tarangadairghyo se sookshm hote hai, at: eksre sookshmdarshi ko prakaash sookshmdarshi se adhik prabhaavshaalee hona chahie
 In 1948, Kirkpatrick's efforts to focus X-rays were partially successful
 is reeti se tathaa anya ritiyon se pratibimb kaa aavardhan karne ke praytn ab praayogic avasthaa paar kar chuke hai or anek nirmaataaon dwaara nirmit kai prakaar ke eksre sookshmdarshi sulabh hai
 Things that cannot be detected with light microscope are easily understood by X-ray microscope

 saao vei rajya, jise kabhi-kabhi sirf 'vei rajya' bhi kaha jaataa he, pracheen china ke teen rajshahiyon ke kaal main china par niyantran paane ke liye jujhane vaala ek rajya tha

 Although the princely state of Sao Sao was simply named 'wei' in 213 AD, but historians often add the family name of 'sao' to it to distinguish it from many other states called Wei in Chinese history
 Wei says

 In 220 AD, Sao Pei removed the last emperor of the Eastern Han Dynasty from the throne

 Article-356 of the Constitution of India empowers the federal government at the center to sack that state government and impose President's rule in that state in the event of failure of constitutional machinery in the state or clear violation of the constitution

 The indo-european language family is the largest language family in the world
 hind-europea bhashaa parivaar main vishwa kii sainkadon bhashaayen or boliyaan sammilit hai
 Some of the modern indo-european languages are: Hindi, Urdu, English, French, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, Persian, Bangla, Punjabi, Russian, etc
 ye sabhi bhashaayen ek hi aadim bhashaa se nikali he, use aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kaa naam de saktaa he
 It was very similar to Sanskrit, as if it were a primitive form of Sanskrit
 in bhashaaon kii visheshtaayen he ki sabhi pracheen hind-europea bhashaaon main sangya, sarvnaam, visheshan or kriya ke kai shabd-rup hote the, jo vaakya main inkaa vyakaranik rup dikhaate the
 Mostly these word-forms were formed by the suffix at the end of the word
 rozmarra kii chizon, sage-sambandhiyon, saamaanya jaanwaron, kriyaaon ke liye kaam aane vaale shabd is parivaar kii sabhi pracheen bhashaaon main ek duusare se bahut milte-julate the or is aadhaar par bhashavidon ne aadim-hind-europea bhashaa kii pariklpana kii
 The forms of the words of these different languages were similar because they were homogeneous words originating from the same ancient root
 neeche diye teble main kuch pracheen or nayi hind-europea bhashaaon kii aam shabdaawalee ke kuch shabd or pariklpit aadim-hind-europea kii punarrachana diye gayi hai 
 There are several branches of the indo-european family
 har shakha kii upashakha or usamen sammilit mukhya pracheen or aadhunik bhashaayen or unke mukhya desh neeche diye hue hai
 indo-european branches are mainly divided into two classes: the Ketum class and the Satam class
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : ky, gy or ghy, sparsh-sangharshi yaa sangharshi vyanjanon main badal gayi, jaise : c, ja, sa or sha
 Simultaneously, the consonants of the adi-indo-european language: qu, g and g, merged into: a, c and d
 inamen baltic, slav, hind irani, armenian or albanian shakhan aati hai
 Sanskrit belongs to this category
 is varg kii pracheen bhashaaon main aadi-hind-europea bhashaa ke vyanjan : kv, gv or ghv vaise hi parirakshit rahe
 The consonants of the adi-indo-european language: Ky, Gy and Ghe, merged into: k, c and d
 inamen itelic, unani, keltic or germanik shakhan aati hai
 The Sanskrit word Arya meant noble and cultured
 isaliye puraane itiharakaron, jaise maks mular ne aadim- or aadhunik hind-europea bhashaa bolne vaali jatiyon kaa naam "arya" rakh diya
 Europeans liked this name very much and soon all the Europeans started describing their countries as the birthplace of ancient Aryans
 vishesh kar hitlar prachaarit kiya ki pracheen aaryon kii janmabhumi germany hi he or arya kaa arth shuddh peedhee kaa manushya he, jisaki twachaa gori, qad lambaa, aankhe neeli or bal sunahare hai
 According to Hittler, the Germans are of the highest and almighty race, and the Jewish people in particular are of inferior and non-aryan race

 After the Jewish massacre of Hitler, the word "arya" is now used in a linguistic sense, not for race

 According to one ideology, the birthplace of the Aryans was in Central Asia, perhaps in southern Russia or around the Caspian Sea

 The migration of the indo-aryan tribes to the Indian subcontinent took place slowly and quietly and there is no evidence of the "bloodshed" of British historians
 us vaqt tak sindhu-ghati sabhyataa yaa to bhukampon se yaa sindhu-saraswati nadiyon kii dhara main badlaav or sookhe kii vajah se khud hi tabah ho gayi thi
 These ideologies are nowadays considered by most of the world's linguists and historians
 madhya asia ke "kurgan kabr-tile" pracheen aaryon dwaara banaaye gayi maane jate hai
 According to another ideology, India is the birthplace of the ancient Aryans and from here the Aryan clan migrated to Europe and the rest of Asia
 is baat ko kai bhartiya or hindutv-vaadi maanate hai, par baaki duniya main is drushtikon kii koi kadra nahin he
 According to most linguists, the reconstructed words of the "primitive-indo-european" language indicate that the ancient Aryan birthplace was a large, temperate grass pasture

 The peasants demanded heavy tax exemption from the British government
 jab yah sweekaar nahin kiya gaya to sardaar patel, gandhiji evam anya logon ne kisaanon kaa netritv kiya or unhe kar na dene ke liye prerit kiya
 Finally, the government bowed down and provided relief in taxes that year

 Nehru in advocacy and he was the first place among the students of the entire British Empire
 nehru praaia: sochate rahete the, sardaar patel use kar daalate the
 Nehru was a scholar of scriptures, Patel was a priest of arms
 patel ne bhi oonchi shiksha pai thi parantu unamem kinchit bhi ahankaar nahin tha
 He himself used to say, "I did not fly high in the great sky of art or science
 meraa vikaas kachi jhopadiyon main garib kisaan ke kheton kii bhoomi or shaharon ke gande makaanon main hua he

 After the independence of the country, Sardar Patel was the Deputy Prime Minister, along with the Minister of Home, Information and State Department

 There has not been a single person in the history of the world who has dared to integrate such a large number of states

 Undoubtedly, the integration of 562 princely states by Sardar Patel was a wonder of world history
 bharat kii yah raktahin kranti thi
 Mahatma Gandhi wrote to Sardar Patel about these princely states, "the problem of princely states was so complex that only you could solve it
 " Although the State Department was Pandit Nehru's field office, he was often referred to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Cabinet as a Deputy Prime Minister
 unki doordarshita kaa laabh yadi us samay liya jaataa to anek vartmaan samasyaon kaa janm na hota
 In a letter to Pandit Nehru in 1950, Patel cautioned China and its policy towards Tibet and described China's attitude as fraudulent and treacherous

 In 1950, after listening to lengthy talks in Goa's two-hour cabinet meeting regarding independence, Sardar Patel only said, "shall we go to Goa, it's only two hours

 By reposing faith in those who served the British, they turned from patriotism to patriotism

 While Sardar Patel was cautious about the pseudo and clever tricks of Pakistan, he was also careful about the disruptive elements of the country

 Many scholars have said that Sardar Patel was like Bismarck
 lekin landan ke times ne likhaa tha "bismark kii safaltaaen patel ke saamne mahatvaheen rah jaati hai

 Sardar Patel, who has continued to lead a life of struggle, did not have the freedom to write independently, but there is great literature available in the form of letters, commentaries and lectures given by him, whose compilation has been published in various forms
