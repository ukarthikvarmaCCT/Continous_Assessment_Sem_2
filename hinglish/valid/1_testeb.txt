 isaki soochna milte hi bhagat singh apane skool se 12 mile paidal chalakar jalianwala baag pahunch gayi
 At this age, Bhagat Singh used to read the revolutionary books of his uncles and wondered whether their path was right? After the non-cooperation movement of Gandhiji broke, he began to choose for himself from the non-violent ways of Gandhiji and the violent movement of revolutionaries
 gandhi ji ke asahyog aandolan ko radd kar dene ke kaaran unamem thodaa rosh utpann hua, par puure raashtra kii tarah wo bhi mahatma gandhi kaa sammaan karte the
 But he did not consider it unfair to adopt the path of violent revolution for the freedom of the country instead of Gandhiji's non-violent movement

 At that time, since the British were the only surveyors and very few Indian industrialists could make progress, their opposition to the atrocities against the British workers was natural
 majdoor virdohi aisi nitiyon ko british sansad main paarit na hone dena unke dal kaa nirnay tha
 Everybody wanted that the British should know that Hindustani has woken up and there is a resentment towards such policies in their heart

 On August 26, 1930, the court convicted Bhagat Singh under sections 129, 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sections 4 and 6F of the Explosive Substances Act and section 120 of the IPC
 7 aktubar, 1930 ko adaalat ke dwaara 68 prishthon kaa nirnay diya, jisamen bhagat singh, sukhdev tathaa raajaguru ko faansee kii sajaa sunai gai

 iske baad bhagat singh kii faansee kii maafee ke liye privi parishad main apil daayar kii gai parantu yah apil 10 janvari, 1931 ko radd kar di gai
 After this, the then Congress President Pt Madan Mohan Malaviya filed an appeal before the Viceroy on 14 February 1931 for forgiveness of sentence, using his privilege to waive his death sentence on the basis of humanity
 bhagat singh kii faansee kii sazaa maaf karwaane hetu mahatma gandhi ne 17 farvari 1931 ko vysarai se baat kii phir 18 farvari, 1931 ko aam janata kii ore se bhi vysarai ke saamne vibhinn tarko ke saath sajaa maafee ke liye apil daayar kii
 All this was happening against the wishes of Bhagat Singh because Bhagat Singh did not want his sentence to be forgiven
 23 march 1931 ko shaam main kareeb 7 bajkar 33 minute par bhagat singh tathaa inke do saathiyon sukhdev va raajaguru ko phaansi de di gai
 He was reading Lenin's biography before going on the gallows and when asked about his last wish, he said that he was reading Lenin's biography and that he should be given time to do it

 "then a minute later the book bounced towards the ceiling and said -" Okay now come on
 " While going on the gallows, the three were singing with joy - phaansi ke baad kahin koi aandolan na bhadak jaye iske dar se angrejon ne pehle inke mrit sharir ke tukade kiye phir ise boriyon main bharkar ferozepur kii ore le gayi jahaan ghi ke badale mitti kaa tel daalkar hi inako jalaayaa jane laga

 Bhagat Singh knew Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi and English as well as Bangla, which he learned from Batukeshwar Dutt
 unka vishwaas tha ki unki shahadat se bhartiya janata or udign ho jaayegi or aisa unke jinda rahane se shaayad hi ho paye
 That is why he refused to write an apology even after he sentenced him to death
 pan0 ram prasad 'bismil' ne apni aatmakatha main jo-jo disha-nirdesh diye the, bhagat singh ne unka aksharsh: paalan kiya
 He also wrote a letter to the British government, stating that he should be considered as a prisoner of war against the British government and instead of being hanged, he should be shot

 The likelihood of spread from one person to another depends on a number of factors including the exit of infectious droplets by the carrier, the effectiveness of air circulation, the duration of the infectious stay, the severity of the M
 tuberculosis effect, the level of resistance in the uninfected person and others
 Is included

 Which is God or eternal truth
 lekin jeevatma or jagat bhagwaan par ashrith hai
 That's why God controls them
 paramatma swatantra hai
 Therefore their classification is impossible

 Just as Gods are immortal, similarly cultured language is immortal by its vast literature, sense of public interest, ability to create new words through various efforts and prefixes
 aadhunik vidwaanon ke anusaar sanskrit bhashaa kaa akhand pravaah paanch sahasr varshon se bahata chalaa aa rahaa he
 It is the most important, comprehensive and rich form of Aryabhasa in India
 iske madhyam se bharat kii utkrishtatam manisha, pratibha, amuly chintan, manan, vivek, rachanaatmak, sarjana or vaicharik pragna kaa abhivyanjan hua he
 Even today, the weak stream of scripture has been unquestionably used in all areas by this language
 aaj bhi yah bhashaa, atyant simit kshetra main hi sahi, boli jaati he
 It consists of lectures and various regional language speakers of India use it in mutual conversation
 hinduon ke saanskarik kaaryon main aaj bhi yah prayukt hoti he
 This is why Sanskrit is different from ancient dead languages like Greek and Latin
 yah mritbhasha nahin, amarbhasha he
 It is a surprise to stop using Sanskrit language in India, some say it was removed due to Sanskrit being difficult
 parantu duniya kii sabase kathin bhashaa to chini he, phir unhone chini bhashaa kaa prayog band kyon nahin kar diya
 It is very strange to convert Sanskrit from our society to Hindi and other languages
 aisa lagata he ki hindi evam anya bhashaaain sanskrit ko tod marod kar bani he, kisi ne sanskrit bhashaa ko khatam karne kaa prayaas kiya tha to vibhinn jagah usase vibhinn bhashaaon kaa nirmaan hua
 And there can be only one reason for doing this, because all our Vedas and ancient texts which are full of knowledge and mystery are all in Sanskrit
 jinhone bhi sanskrit bhashaa ko nasht karne kaa prayaas kiya wo ye nahin chaahate the ki har koi sanskrit main likhe vedon aban puraanon kaa gyaan arjeet kar sake evam rahasyon ko ujagar kar sake
 The language of Rakshanita can be called the earliest available form of Sanskrit
 yah bhi mana jaataa he ki riksanhita ke pratham or dasham mandalon kii bhashaa pracheenatar he
 Some scholars consider the ancient Vedic language to be different from the later Paninian Sanskrit
 par yah paksh bhrampurna he
 Vedic language is essentially the proto-form of Sanskrit language
 panini ne jis sanskrit bhashaa kaa vyakaran likhaa he uske do ansh hai - The words of the Vedic language and the cosmic language have been mentioned even at the beginning of Acharya Patanjali's famous grammar language called "grammar Mahabhashya"
 "sanskrit naam dainvi vaganvakhyata maharshibhi:" vaakya main jise devbhasha yaa 'sanskrit' kaha gaya he vah sambhavat: yask, panini, katyayan or patanjali ke samay tak "chandobhasha" evam "lokbhasha" ke do naamon, staron va roopon main vyakt thi
 Many scholars believe that the word "sanskrit" for the language has been used adjectively by Hanuman in the Sundarkand of the first Valmiki Ramayana
 bhartiya parampara kii kinvadanti ke anusaar sanskrit bhashaa pehle avyaakrit thi, arthath uski prakruti evam pratyayadi kaa vishlisht vivechan nahin hua tha
 On praying by the Devas, Devraj Indra introduced the metaphysical legislation of analysis, analysis of nature, suffixes etc
 isi "sanskaar" vidhaan ke kaaran bharat kii pracheenatam aryabhasha kaa naam "sanskrit" padaa
 The "developed cosmic Sanskrit" or "paninian Sanskrit" is the only ever-evolving form of the literary "vedic language" of the texts of the Raksanhitha period, "sadhubhasha" and "brahmana", "aranyak" and "dasopanishad"
 isi bhashaa ko "sanskrit","sanskrit bhashaa" yaa "saahitiyik sanskrit" naamon se janaa jaataa he
 From the point of view of development, "sanskrit" means - made of Sansa
 aadhyatm evam samprak-vikaas kii drushti se "sanskrit" kaa arth he - swayan se krit yaa jo aarmabhik logon ko swayan dhyaan lagane evam parasapar samprak se aa gai
 Some people also consider Sanskrit as a sacrament
 desh-kaal kii drushti se sanskrit ke sabhi swarupon kaa muladhar purvatar kaal main udichy, madhyadeshiy evam aryavartiya vibhaashaayen hai
 These divisions are mentioned by the words "vibhasha" or "udicham" in the Paninisutras
 inke atirikt kuch kshetron main "praachya" aadi boliyaan bhi boli jaati thim
 But Panini gave the language a sophisticated and universally usable form by regular grammar
 dhire-dhire paninisammat bhashaa kaa prayogrup or vikaas praaia: sthaayee ho gaya
 By the time of Patanjali, Sanskrit became a colloquial language among the noble people of Aryavarta
 "gadarshatpratyakkalkavnaddakshinen himavantamuttaren vaariatrametsminnaryavarten aryaanivaase xxrep 5 
 " ullekh ke anusaar sheeghra hi sanskrit samgr bharat ke dwijativarg or vidvatsamaj kii saanskrithik, vicharakaar evam vicharadanpradan kii bhashaa ban gai
 From the point of view of the development of Sanskrit language, many scholars have chronicled its history in many ways
 saamaanya suvidha kii drushti se adhik maanya nimnaankit kalvibhaajan diya ja rahaa he - Time madhyakaal Later is yug main kavy, naatak, sahityashastra, tantrashastra, shilpashaastra aadi ke granthon kii rachana ke saath-saath mul granthon kii vyaakhyaatmak, kritiyon kii mahatvapurn sarjana hui
 In the thousands of texts which were produced in the form of commentaries, commentaries, descriptions, lectures, etc
, the reputation, recognition and fame of many commentaries and commentaries went far beyond the texts
 pramanikta ke vichaar se is bhashaa kaa sarvapracheen uplabdh vyakaran panini kii ashtaadhi he
 At least 600 BC Even today, this book is an incomparable grammar in the whole world
 vishwa ke or mukhyat: america ke bhashashasthri sanghatnatmak bhashavigyaan kii drushti se ashtaadhi ko aaj bhi vishwa kaa sarvottam granth maanate hai
 "broomfield" has established this fact in his "language" and other works
 panini ke purv sanskrit bhashaa nishchay hi shisht evam vaidic janon kii vyavahaarabhasha thi
 Many of the dialects would have been prevalent at that time also among the untrained people
 par yah mat aadhunik bhashavigyon ko maanya nahin he
 He says that Sanskrit was never a lingua franca
 janata kii bhashaaon ko tatkaaleen praakrit kaha ja saktaa he
 Devbhasha was essentially the language of Brahmin Pandits created by artificers or sacraments, not the lingua franca
 parantu yah mat sarvamaanya nahin he
 Everyone from Panini to Patanjali have called Sanskrit the language of the folk, a cosmic language
 anya saikadon pramaan siddh karte hai ki "sanskrit" vaidic or vaidicottar purvapaninikaal main lokbhasha or vyavahaarabhasha thi
 It must have been that in terms of country, age and society, it must have had its own limits
 baad main chalakar vah pathit samaaj kii saahitiyik or saanskrithik bhashaa ban gai
 Subsequently, it became a widely accepted cultural language of all pundits all over India, whether they were Aryans or non-aryans, and Asetuhimachal has been spreading, respecting and propagating and continues to this day
 lagbhag satrahavin shatabdi ke purvardh se yorape or pashchimi deshon ke mishanri evam anya vidyapremiyon ko sanskrit kaa parichay praapt hua
 Gradually Sanskrit was propagated not only in the West but in the whole world
 german, angrej, francisi, amareeki tathaa yorape ke anek chote bade desh ke nivasee vidwaanon ne vishesh rup se sanskrit ke adhyayan anushilan ko aadhunik vidwaanon main prajapriy banaaya
 Sanskrit is the most systematic, scientific and thriving language among the world's languages in the opinion of modern scholars and followers
 vah aaj keval bhartiya bhashaa hi nahin, ek rup se vishwabhasha bhi he
 It can be said that Sanskrit is perhaps the most voluminous, comprehensive, round-headed and accomplished in Bhumandal's effort-language literature
 sansar ke praaia: sabhi viksit or sansar ke praaia: sabhi vikasman deshon main sanskrit bhashaa or sahitya kaa aaj adhyayan-adhyaapan ho rahaa he
 It has been said that the introduction of this language gave a solid foundation to the Western scholars in the study of subjects related to the Arya caste, its culture, life and the so-called original Arya language
 pracheen greek, latin, avastaa or riksanskrit aadi ke aadhaar par mul aadya aryabhasha kii dhwani, vyakaran or swaroop kii pariklpana kii ja saki jisen riksanskrit kaa avdaan sabase adhik mahatv kaa he
 Sanskrit has a close and familial relationship with Greek, Latin, etc
 par bharat-irani-varg kii bhashaaon ke saath sanskrit kii sarvaadhik nikatataa he
 Originally the Rigveda and the Sanskrit of Sanskrit in the development of all the ancient, medieval and modern Aryan languages of India have been the basic and industrial contribution
 aadhunik bhashavaigyanik maanate hai ki rugvedakaal se hi jansamanya main bolchaal kii tathabhoot praakrit bhashaayen avashya prachlit rahi hongi
 From them, Pali, Prakrit, Apabhramsa and post-aryan languages were developed
 parantu is vikaas main sanskrit bhashaa kaa sarvaadhik or sarvavidh yogadan rahaa he
 It is also to be remembered here that Sanskrit language greatly influenced and influenced the non-aryan languages of different regions and regions of India; Not only did they influence the culture and literature of those languages and their speakers, their languages dictionary also benefited from their contribution to their soundtrack and clerical
 bharat kii do pracheen lipiyaan- brahmi or kharoshti thim
 Among them, Sanskrit was predominantly adopted by Brahmi
 bhashaa kii drushti se sanskrit kii dhvanimala paryaapt sampann he
 Though from the point of view of vowels, Greek, Latin etc
 have a special place, in view of their region, the vocabulary of Sanskrit is sufficient and linguistic
 vyanjanamala atyant sampann he
 For thousands of years, the teaching of the Adyutisakhyatya of the Indian Aryans continued as an oral tradition by the Guru's disciples because, perhaps in that era, the clericalism did not emerge and develop
 sambhavat: panini ke kuch purv yaa kuch baad se lipi kaa bharat main prayog chal padaa or mukhyat: "brahmi" ko sanskrit bhashaa kaa vaahan banaaya gaya
 This Brahmi also influenced the alphabet and alphabet of most scripts of Arya and Arya
 yadi madhyakaalin naanaa bhartiya dravid bhashaaon tathaa tamil, telugu aadi kii varnmaala par bhi sanskrit bhashaa or brahmi lipi kaa paryaapt prabhaav he
 The Sanskrit alphabet, which is popular from Paninikal in terms of sound and acoustics, is probably still the most scientific and classical alphabet in the world
 sanskrit bhashaa ke saath-saath samast vishwa main pratyaksh yaa roman acarantic ke rup main aaj samast sansar main iskaa prachaar ho gaya he
 In terms of historical linguistics, the Sanskrit language is placed under the Aryabhasa family
 aryajati bharat main baahar se ai yaa yahan iskaa nivas tha - ityadi vichaar anaavashyak hone se yahan nahin kiya ja rahaa he
 But according to the pundits of modern linguistics according to the belief that the ancient languages of the indo-european linguists, they were in fact different branches of a native language
 un sabaki udgambhasha yaa mulbhasha kaa aadyaaryabhasha kehete hai
 In the opinion of some scholars, only the well-organized Aryans of veera-moolnivasasthan were called "viros" or Veeras
 viros shabd dwaara jin purvokt pracheen aryabhasha samooh bhashiyon kaa dyotan hota he un vividh pracheen bhashabhashiyon ko viraas kaha gaya he
 That is, all the languages are family languages from the family point of view
 sanskrit kaa inamen anyatam sthaan he
 "kantum" and "shatam" are the two major branches of the said family
 pratham ke antargat greek, latin aadi aati hai
 Sanskrit is considered to be in the indo-iranian branch under "shatam"
 aryapariwaar main koun pracheen, pracheenatar or pracheenatam he yah purnat: nishchit nahin he
 Nevertheless, most modern linguists consider Greek, Latin etc
 as the eldest child of the Aryan language and Sanskrit as their younger sister
 itnaa hi nahin bharat-irani-shakha kii pracheenatam avastaa ko bhi sanskrit se pracheen maanate hai
 But many Indian scholars understand that the Avasta form of "jind-avasta" is new rather than Rakbhasha
 jo bhi ho, itnaa nishchit he ki granthrup main smritirup se avshisht vaanmay main riksanhita pracheenatam he or isi kaaran vah bhashaa bhi apni uplabdhi main pracheenatam he
 The great feature of his Vedic codes is that for thousands of years, when script art was not even born, Vedic codes were pervaded in the society of the teachers by oral and euphemistic tradition
 uccharan kii shuddhta ko itnaa surakshit rakhaa gaya ki dhwani ore matraayen, hi nahin, sahasron varshon purv se aaj tak vaidic mantron main kahin pathbhed nahin hua
 The utterance of the sublime Anudattadi vowels remained completely undisturbed in pure form
 aadhunik bhashavaigyanik yah maanate hai ki swaron kii drushti se greek, latin aadi ke "kentum" varg kii bhashaayen adhik sampann bhi hai or mul yaa aadya aryabhasha ke adhik sameep bhi
 The property of the said language is more secure in them
 sanskrit main vyanjansampatti adhik surakshit he
 From the point of view of organizational or morphological idea of language, Sanskrit language is called Vibhaktipradhan or "shlikbhasha" tatvachintamani, gangesh upaadhyaay dwaara rachit navyanyay kaa prasiddh granth he
 All the scriptures written after Tattvachantamani are known as Navyanya
 unhone gautam ke maatr ek sutara 'pratyakshanumanopamaan shabdaah pramanati' kii vyakhya main is granth kii rachana kii he
 This Nyaya Granth is divided into four sections - pratyakhanda, anakhandaand, upamanandha and shabhakhanda
 isamen purvavarti naiyayikon kii bhaanti 16 tattvon kaa varnan nahin kiya gaya he
 In this, he gave birth to a new independent writing style by using terms such as subjunctive, subjunctive, denotative, competitive, etc
 which have been followed by many later philosophers
 tatvachintamani par jitani tikaayen, jitne vistaar ke saath likhi gai hai utani kisi anya granth par nahin likhi gai
 Mishra was first commented by; Subsequently his disciple Rudradatta prepared his own commentary
