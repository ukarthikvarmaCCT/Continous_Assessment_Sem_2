 aadigranth sikh sampradaay kaa pramukh dharmagranth he
 It is also called 'guru Granth Sahib'
 iskaa sampadan sikh dharm ke paanchaven guru shri guru arjuna dev ji ne kiya
 The first light of Guru Granth Sahib was on 16 August 1604 at Harimandir Sahib in Amritsar
 1705 main damdama sahib main dashamesh pita guru govind singh ji ne guru tegbahadur ji ke 116 shabd jodakar isko purna kiya, isame kul 1430 prishth he
 Gurugranth Sahib contains not only the teachings of Sikh Gurus, but also the speech of 30 other Hindu saints and Muslim devotees of the Alang religion
 isame jahaan jayadevaji or paramanandji jaise brahman bhakton kii vaani he, vahiin jati-panti ke aatmahanta bhedbhaav se grast tatkaaleen hindu samaaj main hey samajhe jane vaali jatiyon ke pratinidhi divya atmaaon jaise kabir, ravidaas, namdev, sain ji, saghnaa ji, chhivaji, dhanna kii vaani bhi sammilit he
 The verses of Sheikh Farid, who believed in offering Namaz at all five times, are also recorded in the Guru Granth Sahib
 apni bhashaayi abhivyakti, darshaniktaa, sandesh kii drushti se guru granth sahib adwitiya he
 The simplicity, comprehensibility, accuracy of its language attracts the masses
 vahiin sangeet ke suron va 31 raagon ke prayog ne aatmavishyak gudh aadhyatmik upadeshon ko bhi madhur va sargrahi bana diya he
 The philosophicalism mentioned in Guru Granth Sahib recognizes karmism
 guuruvaani ke anusaar vyakti apane karmo ke anusaar hi mahatv paata he
 Gurugranth Sahib gives lessons to the seekers who are looking for the means of attaining God in sannyas, cut off from the mainstream of society
 haalanki guru granth sahib main aatmanirikshan, dhyaan kaa mahatv sweekaara gaya he, magar sadhana ke naam par parityag, akarmanyata, nishcheshtataa kaa guuruvaani virodh karti he

 main sangruhit karaayaa tha or jise sikh matanuai 'gurugranth sahib ji' bhi kehete evam guruvat maanakar sammanit kiya karte hai
 Under 'adigranth', apart from the first five gurus of Sikhs, there are the statements of their ninth Guru and 14 'bhagats'
 aisa koi sangrah sambhavat: guru nanakdev ke samay se hi taiyaar kiya jane laga tha or guru amardaas ke putr mohan ke yahan pratham chaar guruon ke patradi surakshit bhi rahe, jinhen paanchaven guru ne unase lekar pun: krambaddh kiya tathaa unamem apni ore kuch 'bhagaton' kii bhi baniyaan sammilit karke sabko bhai gurudas dwaara gurumukhi main lipibaddh kara diya
 Brother Bannon then copied the same and mixed the compositions of some other people which were not approved, but also the works of some others, Govind Singh prepared a third 'beed' in which, along with the works of the ninth Guru, himself
 One of his 'saloks' was also ranked
 uskaa yahi rup aaj bhi vartmaan samajha jaataa he
 It is difficult to say only about a few final compositions when and how they were added
 'granth' kii pratham paanch rachanaayen kramash: 'japunisanu', 'sodaru' mahala1, 'sunibada' mahala1, 'so purakhu', mahala 4 tathaa sohila mahala ke naamon se prasiddh hai or inke ananthar 'sirirag' aadi 31 raagon main vibhakt pad aate hai jinamein pehle sikhaguruon kii rachanaayen unke anusaar sangruhit hai
 The positions of the Bhagats have been kept in their interiors, but somewhere in between, 'barhamasa', 'thinti', 'dinraini', 'ghodiyaan', 'siddha Gosthi', 'karhale', 'birhade', 'sukhmani' etc
 Certain small and big specific compositions have also been added, which illustrate the poetic nature of ordinary folk songs
 un raganusaar krambaddh padon ke ananthar salok sahas kriti, 'gaatha' mahala 5, 'phunhe' mahala 5, chaubolen mahala 5, savaie simukh vaak mahala 5 or mudaavni mahala 5 ko sthaan mila he or sabhi ke ant main ek ragamala bhi de di gai he
 Even in the midst of these works, if 'salok' of Kabir and Sheikh Farid is stored, then elsewhere there are those eulogies created by 11 posts which are said to be in praise of Sikh Gurus and whose number is not even less
 'granth' main sangruhit rachanaayen bhashavavidhya ke kaaran kuch vibhinn lagati hui bhi, adhiktar saamanjasy evam ekarupata ke hi udhaaharan prastut karti hai
 Sometimes Adibranth is also called 'gurubani', but in the eyes of its devotees, it is always a physical guru
 at: guru ke samaan use svachh reshmi vastron main veshtit karke chandani ke neeche kisi unchi gaddi par 'padhraya' jaataa he, usapar chanwar dhalate hai, pushpadi chadhaate hai, uski aarti utaarte hai tathaa uske saamne naha dhokar jate or shraddhapurvak pranaam karte hai
 Sometimes his procession is also taken out and always try to walk accordingly
 granth kaa kabhi saptahik tathaa kabhi akhand paath karte hai or uski panktiyon kaa kuch uccharan us samay bhi kiya karte hai jab kabhi baalkon kaa namakaran kiya jaataa he, use diksha di jaati he tathaa vivahadi ke mangalotsav aate hai athwa shavsanskaar kiye jate hai
 Suitable times for specific small major compositions such as morning, evening, bedtime are certain and although the subjects of major collected works seem to be mainly related to philosophical principles, spiritual practice and praise, there is no doubt that 'etc
 The entire religious life of the Sikhs is influenced by the book

 The language of Sri Gurugranth Sahib is closer to the Hindi language than the modern Punjabi language and the meaning of guru-vyans is more perceptible to the Hindi-speaking than the Punjabi-speaking one

 Tria means the ritual of offering oil to the woman once at the same time, in the same way, Hammir also considered it important to complete a task in one go instead of repeating it again, that is, the stubbornness of King Hammir Dev Chauhan was a symbol of his fearlessness

 It was not frightened even a little, Chauhan was fighting with Ranthambore, he was not bowing down to the Mughals nor stopped, Ram stood on Ravana with respect in the last, v He had told the Mughals from Si, had tasted the Mughals, Prasad had left the life of Ranthambore, a devotee of his zeal, had turned the enemy as if he had broken the arrogance of Krishna was the strength of Arjuna, the essence of the Chauhans was Chauhan

 Maharaja Suraj Mal was politically intelligent, visionary, handsome, shapely and healthy
 unhone jaipur ke maharaja jaisingh se bhi dosti bana lee thi
 Jaisingh died on 21 September 1743, and soon thereafter a fight ensued over his sons Ishwari Singh and Madhosingh
 maharaja surajmal bade bete ishwari singh ke paksh main the jabaki udaipur ke maharana jagat singh madhosingh ke paksh main the
 Later in Jahazpur the two brothers fought and Ishwari Singh won in March 1747
 ek saal baad may 1748 main peshwaon ne ishwari singh par dabaav daalaa ki wo maadho singh ko chaar pargana saunp de
 Then Marathe, Sisodia, Rathore, Vagira, the armies of the seven kings joined with Madhosingh and Ishwari Singh fell alone
 In 1753, Maharaja Suraj Mal captured Firoz Shah Kotla
 dilli ke nawab gaji-ud-deen ne phir maraathon ko surajmal ke khilaaf bhadakaayaa or phir maraathon ne janvari 1754 se may 1754 tak bharatpur jile main surajmal ke kumher kile ko ghere rakhaa
 The Marathas could not capture the fort and in that battle, Khande Rao Holkar, son of Malhar Rao was killed
 maraathon ne surajmal kii jaan lene kii thaan lee thi par maharani kishori ne sindhiyaaon kii madad se marathaon or surajmal main sandhi karvaa di
 According to Vendel, Jat power emerged as a dominant power in northern India during this period of shabby Mughal power

 At the same time, there was no campaign of Mughals in which jat-shakti was not invited for cooperation

 The combined power of maratha-mughal-rajputs under the leadership of the deposed Meerbakhshi Ghaziuddin Khan of the deposed Wazir Safdarjung could not conquer even Kumher, the small fort of Surajmal in 1754

 According to Wendell, 'such a harsh and so precise defeat of Mughal arrogance had never happened before'

 Later in 1760, there were some differences between Sadashiv Rao Bhau and Suraj Mal
 mathura kii nabi masjid ko dekhakar bhaau ne gusse main kaha - surajmal ji, mathura itane din se aapke kabje main he, phir is masjid ko aapane kaise chhod diya? surajmal ne jawaab diya - agar mujhe yakeen hota ki main sari umr is ilaake kaa badshaah rahoonga to shaayad main is masjid ko girava detaa, par kya phayda? kal musalmaan aakar hamaare mandiron ko giravaayen or vahiin par masjiden banavaa den to aapako acha lagegaa? baad main phir bhaau ne laal kile ke diwane-khaas kii chat ko girwane kaa hukum diya tha, yah soch kar ki is sone ko bechakar apane sainikon kii tankhwaah de duungaa
 On this too Surajmal refused him, even said that take five lakh rupees from me, but do not break it, after all Nadir Shah had also spared this roof
 par bhaau nahin mana - jab chat kaa sona todaa gaya to vah mushkil se teen lakh rupee kaa niklaa
 Bhau did not listen to many things about Surajmal and also said that - i have not come here from far south on the strength of your strength
 14 janvari 1761 main panipat kii teesri ladaai maraathon or ahmedshah abdali ke bich hui
 More than half of the one lakh soldiers of the Marathas were killed
 maraathon ke paas na to puraa rashan tha or na hi is ilaake kaa unhen bhed tha, kai-kai din ke bhukhe sainik kya yuddh karte ? agar sadashiv raav maharaja surajmal se choti-si baat par takaraar na karke use bhi is jang main saajheedaar banaata, to aaj bharat kii tasviir or hi hoti| maharaja surajmal ne phir bhi dosti kaa haq adaa kiya
 When thirty-forty thousand Marathas started going back after the war, they had a bad condition while reaching the area of surajmal

 For ten days, Surajmal took him to Rakha in Bharatpur, administered his medicine and arranged food and clothes
 maharani kishori ne bhi janata se apil karke anaaj aadi icttha kiya
 It is heard that some twenty lakh rupees were spent in their service and water
 jate hue har aadmi ko ek rupaya, ek ser anaaj or kuch kapade aadi bhi diye taaki raste kaa kharch nikaal saken
 Some Maratha soldiers had also brought their families before the fighting and left them in the villages of Haryana
 unki maut ke baat unki vidhwaaen waapas nahin gayi
 Later, the family rode into the culture of Haryana

 Both of these are unique in themselves
 Under Jahangir the Hindu features vanished from the style; his great mosque at Lahore is in the Persian style, covered with enamelled tiles
 At Agra, the tomb of itmad-ud-daula completed in 1628, built entirely of white marble and covered wholly by pietra dura mosaic, is one of the most splendid examples of that class of ornamentation anywhere to be found
 Jahangir also built the Shalimar Gardens and its accompanying pavilions on the shore of Dal Lake in Kashmir
 He also built a monument to his pet antelope, Hiran Minar in Sheikhupura, Pakistan and due to his great love for The agrawal is the best in bharatpur it is made in tajmahal and originality of the style given way under Shah Jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail, illustrated in the magnificent palaces erected in his reign at Agra and Delhi, the latter one the most exquisitely beautiful in India
 The most splendid of the Mogul tombs, and the most renowned building in India, is the Taj Mahal at Agra, the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of Shah jahan
the Moti Masjid in the Agra Fortand The Jama Masjid at Delhi are an imposing building, and their position and architecture have been carefully considered so as to produce a pleasing effect and feeling of spacious elegance and well-balanced proportion of parts
 In his works Shah Jahan presents himself as the most magnificent builder of Indian sovereigns
 He also built the mausoleum and sections of the huge Lahore Fort that include the impressive Moti Masjid, Sheesh Mahal, and Naulakha pavilion which are all enclosed in the fort
 He also built a mosque after himself in Thatta called Shahjahan Mosque
 Another mosque was built during his tenture in Lahore called Wazir Khan Mosque, by Shaikh Ilm-ud-din Ansari who was the court physician to the emperor
 The Taj Mahal, the "teardrop on eternity", was completed in 1648 by the emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal who died while giving birth to their 14th child
 The extensive use of precious and semiprecious stones as inlay and the vast quantity of white marble required nearly bankrupted the empire
 The Taj Mahal is completely symmetric other than the sarcophagus of Shah Jahan, which is placed off center in the crypt room below the main floor
 This symmetry extended to the building of an entire mirror mosque in red sandstone, to complement the Mecca-facing mosque place to the west of the main structure
hi The Taj Mahal in Agra, India and the Shalimar Garden in Lahore, Pakistan, are two sites which are on the world heritage list of UNESCO
 One can see the architectural similarities and the love for water that the Mughals expressed in many of their buildings
 The Taj is considered to be one of the most beautiful monuments of love and is one of the Seven Wonders of the World, when it comes to tourism
 In Aurangzeb's reign squared stone and marble gave way to brick or rubble with stucco ornament
 Srirangapatna and Lucknow have examples of later indo-muslim architecture
 He also added his mark to the Lahore Fort and built one the largest mosques in the city, called Badshahi Mosque
 He also built one of the thirteen gates, and it was later named after him, Alamgir

 Most of the people of Bishnupriya Manipuri migrated from Manipur and took refuge in Assam, Tripura, Sylhet and Cachar during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries due to internal conflicts between the princes of Assam, Manipur and the invasion of Burma

 Aging in humans reflects a multifaceted process of physical, mental, and social change
 samay ke saath vriddhavastha ke kuch aayam badhate or failte hai, jabaki anyon main giravat aati he
 For example, response time may decrease with age while information and intelligence about world events may increase
 anusandhan se pataa chalata he ki jivan ke antim daur main bhi shaareerik, maansik or saamaajik tarakkee or vikaas kii sambhaavnaaen maujuud hoti hai
 Age is an important part of all human societies, reflecting biological changes, but it also reflects cultural and social traditions
 umr ko aam taur par purna varshon ke anusaar - or chote bacchon ke liye maheenon main mapa jaataa he
 a person's birthday is often an important event
 mote taur par duniya bhar main 1,00,000 log umr sambandhi kaarnon kii vajah se marate hai
 The definition of "aging" is somewhat unclear
 "saarvbhaumik vriddhavastha" or "sambhavya vriddhavastha" main bhed kiye ja sakate he
 Chronological aging is arguably the simplest definition of how old a person is and can be distinguished from "social aging" and "biological aging"
 "asann vriddhavastha" or "vilambit vriddhavastha" main bhi antar he
 There have been occasional differences regarding the population of elderly people
 kabhi kabhi is aabaadi kaa vibhaajan yuva bujurgon, praudh bujurgon or atyadhik buudhe bujurgon ke bich kiya jaataa he
 However, the problem with this is that chronological age is not fully aligned with functional age, meaning that two people may be of the same age but have different mental and physical abilities
 Each country, government and NGO have different methods for classifying age
 samaaj main buudhe logon kii sankhya tathaa anupaat main vruddhi ko vruddh jansankhya kehete hai
 There are three possible reasons for the aging population: immigration, long life expectancy, and low birth rates
 Old age has a significant impact on society
 yuva log sabase adhik aparaadh karte hai, ve nai praudyogikiyon ko viksit karne or apnaane or shiksha kii jarurat ke liye raajnneetik or saamaajik badlaav karne ke adhik utsuk hote hai
 Elderly people want something different from society and government rather than young people and often their social values are also different
 vruddh logon dwaara mat dene kii sambhaavna adhik hoti he or isliye kai deshon main yuvaaon ko matdaan karne kii manaahi he
 Thus, the political influence of older people is relatively high
 saarvbhaumik maanviya anubhav hone ke baavjood, vriddhavastha kaa aupchaarik vishleshan sabase pehle 1532 main mohammad ebn usoof al-haraavi dwaara apni pustak "anul hayaat" main kiya gaya tha, jise madhyakaalin chikitsa or vigyaan kii ebn sina academy dwaara prakashit kiya gaya tha
 This book is based on old age and related issues
 "anul hayaat" kii mul pandulipi 1532 main lekhak mohammad ebn yusuf al-haraavi dwaara likhi gai thi
 There are said to be 4 copies of this old manuscript in various libraries of the world
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki is duniya main vriddhavastha par yah pehla lekh he
 After matching these four copies, Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman edited and translated the manuscript in 2007
 sampadit pustak dwaara, aap jaan sakate hai ki kis prakaar ascharyajanak dhang se 500 saal pehle hi lekhak ne aahaar, paryaavaran or vriddhavastha main gharelu sthitiyon sahit sabhi prakaar ke vyavhaar or jivan style karkon par charchaa kii he
 He has also discussed the topic of which medicines can increase and decrease old age
 jeev vigyaan main, boodha hona umr badhane kii ek dasha yaa prakriya he
 Biological aging is a process in which isolated cells exhibit limited ability to divide into culture, while organism aging is called organismal aging
 purna navinikaran kii avadhi ke baad, orgenizmal budhaape ko tanaav ke prati pratikriya dene kii kshamta main kami, homeostatic asantulan or bimariyon ke badhate khatre dwaara pahachaanaa ja saktaa he
 These changes of the irreversible chain inevitably end in death
 kuch shodhakarta budhaape ko ek rog maan rahe hai
 Since genes influencing age have been discovered, aging is also increasingly considered to be potentially "treatable" "conditions" like other genetic "effects"
 darasal, jivan main umr kaa badhanaa na roka ja sakane vaala gun he
 Instead, it is the result of a genetic program
 kai prajatiyon main umr badhane ke bahut kam sanket mili hai, jiske sarvshereshth udhaaharan bristolakon chid jaise ped, sterjan or rockfish jaisi machhlee, kwahog or samudri anemon or jhinge jaise aksherucay jeev hai
 In humans and other animals, biologic aging has been attributed to decreasing telomeres in each cell cycle, when telomeres are too short the cells die
 isliye hefilic kii bhavishyavaanee ke anusaar, telomar kii lambaai ek "aanvik ghadi" he
 The length of the telomere is sustained by the telomere enzyme in immortalized cells
 prayogshaala main, nashwar koshika rekhaon ko unke telomar jeenon ko sakriy karke amar kiya ja saktaa he, jo sabhi koshikaon main paaya jaataa he kintu kuch vishesh prakaar kii koshikaon main hi sakriy rahata he
 Cancer cells are required to have the property of multiplying multiples without immortalization
 cancer karkon ke prati yah mahatvapurn prakriya cancer ke 85% maamalon main lagu hoti he, jisame utparivartan dwaara telomar jeenon kaa purnsakriyan hota he
 Since this mutation is rare, the telomere "clock" can be seen as a defensive mechanism against cancer
 anusandhan darshata he ki ghadi prayek koshika ke nabhik main sthit honi chahie or aisi suchanaaen milin hai ki manushya ke gunasutron ke 23wein jode ke pehle yaa chauthe gunasutron ke jeenon main dderghaayu ghadi sthit ho sakati he
 Other genes that influence the aging process have been shown to have a significant effect on the life span of the sertin gene yeast and nematode
 khamir main arees2 jin kii bahutayat isaki umr ko kaaphi had tak badha detii he
 In addition to genetic relationships to life span, it has been observed that diet in many animals affects life to a large extent
 vishesh rup se, calories ghataane se chuhon kii jivan avadhi 50% tak badhati hui dekhi gai he
 Calorie binding also affects many other organisms in addition to mice, and according to a study done by the National Institutes of Health on rhesus monkeys can increase the life span in human-like animals, however a significant increase in life span occurs only if Calorie bonding should be started from the beginning of life
 Because, at the molecular level, age is counted by the number of repeats of cells rather than time, this effect of caloric binding can be maintained by decreasing cell growth and increasing the time frame of cells to fission
 vartmaan main dawa companiyaan bhojan kii khapat ko kam kiye bina calories bandhan ke jivan avadhi badhane vaale prabhaavon kii nakal karne vaale vikalp dhund rahi hai
 In his book 'how and Why We Age', Dr
 Hayphilic mentions a paradox of the caloric bond longevity enhancement theory for humans, according to data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging that leaning leads to no longevity
 ek jaanavar ke jivan ko aksar vibhinn aayu virgon main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 However, since biological changes are slow and can vary within the same species, dates have been uncontrollably determined to identify the duration of life
 neeche die gaye maanav jivan avadhi ke vibhaajan sabhi samskritiyon ke liye maanya nahin hai: Age can also be divided by decade: 13 se 19 varsh kii umr ke logon ko tin yaa tinagers bhi kaha jaataa he
 Occasional terms such as "twentysomething", "thirtysomething", etc
 are also used to describe people by decade or age
 kuch samskritiyon main umr ko vyakt karne ke chaar dhang hai: vartmaan varsh sahit yaa iske bina varshon kii gananaa dwaara
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek hi vyakti ke liye yah kaha ja saktaa he ki uski aayu bees varsh he athwa vah apane jivan ke ikkisven varsh main pravesh kar chukaa he
 The first expression is commonly used in Russian culture, the latter is limited in use: it is used in the obituary for the age of a deceased person and for the age of an adult when it is necessary to indicate that How much / how big / was she compared to him
 saanskrithik or vyaktigat darshan ke aadhaar par, vriddhavastha ko ek avaanchhneeya ghatana ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he, jo sundarataa ko kam karti he or vyakti ko maut ke kareeb laati he; yaa phir ise gyaan ke sanchay, astitv ke chihn or ek sammaan yogya sthiti ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Numerical age is important in some cases, while many consider life stages to be more important
 purvi asian aayu gananaa pashchimi samskruti main pai jane vaale aayu gananaa se alag he
 In traditional Chinese culture, a different type of method is used to determine the normal age, in addition to the method called zhousui, called zhusui
 jhusui vidhi main, janm ke samay logon kii aayu 0 kii bajaae 1 varsh hoti he, kyonki garbhaadhan avadhi ko pehle se hi jivan kaal kii shuruyaat mana jaataa he, tathaa ek anya antar aging de he: jhusui vasant mahotsav ke dauraan apana janmdin manaate hai, jabaki shuo an kii aayu apane janmdin par badhati he
 There are variations in many countries regarding the age at which a person legally becomes an adult
 kai kanoonee pranaaliyon main ek vishesh aayu paribhaashit kii gayi he jab kisi vyakti vishesh ko kuch karne kii anumati milti he yaa anumati di jaati he
 This includes voting age, age of drinking, age of consent, age of adulthood, age of criminal liability, age of marriage, age of candidacy and age of compulsory retirement
 udhaaharan ke liye film dekhne kii anumati moshan pikchar reating pranali ke anusaar di gayi umr seemaa par nirbhar ho sakati he
 a bus fare may be discounted for a young or old person
 isi prakaar kai deshon ke nyaayashastra main praarambhik avasthaa kii raksha ek prakaar kaa bachaav he jisame bachaavkarta yah daleel de sakate hai ki jis samay kanoon todaa gaya tha, us samay kiye gaye apane kaaryon ke liye ve uttaradaayi nahin the or isliye unhen aparaadh ke liye uttaradaayi nahin tehraaya janaa chahie
 Many courts hold that defendants considered juveniles may avoid criminal prosecution based on their age and justify lowering the offender's age in suspected cases

 ek ore jahaan samaaj par iske jatil prabhaav padate hai, vahiin duusari ore swasthya seva sambandhit aavashyaktaaon par padane vaala prabhaav bhi ek chintaa kaa vishay he
 a large number of suggestions in the literature for specific interventions to deal with the expected increase in long-term care demand in older societies can be combined under four headings: improving system performance; Redesigning the service delivery process; Providing assistance to informal caretakers; And changing demographic standards
 baharhaal, rashtriya swasthya kharch main vaarshik vruddhi mukhya rup se vridhon kii badhati hui aabaadi ke kaaran nahin he, balki iske badhane kaa kaaran badhati aamadani, nai mahangi chikitsa takanic, swasthya dekhbhaal kaaryakartaaon kii sankhya main kami tathaa seva pradaataaon or rogiyon ke bich soochna main vishamataayen hai
 Nevertheless, it is estimated that since 1970, the increase in the population of the elderly in medical spending of 4
3 percent has increased the annual growth rate by only 0
2 percentage points

 This suggests that the impact by the older population on health care costs is not inevitable
 july 2007 tak, sanyukt rajya america main ek vishisht kaidi ke liye ek agency kii chikitsa laagat lagbhag 33 dollar prati din tak thi, jabaki buudhe kaidi ke liye yah laagat 100 dollar tak ho sakati he
 Most state documents show that more than 10 percent of the annual budget is spent on caring for older people

 It is believed that various factors such as social support, religion and spirituality, actively engaging with life and self-centeredness are beneficial in coping with stressful life events at the end of life
 saamaajik samarthan or nijee niyantran sambhawatah do sabase mahatvapurn kaarak hai jo vayaskon ke swasthya, rugnataa or mrityu dar ke bare main bataate hai
 Other factors that may be related to the health and quality of life of the elderly include social relationships and health
 ek hi sevanivritti ghar ke vibhinn pakshon ke vyaktiyon ne kam mrityu dar jokhim or ucch satarkta kaa pradarshan kiya he or jahaan nivaasiyon kaa apane aas paas ke vaataavaran par adhik niyantran tha, vahaan swasthya kaa aatm-moolyankan kiya he, haalanki nijee niyantran kaa swasthya ke vishisht upayon par kam asar ho saktaa he
 Social control, these perceptions of how much influence a person has on social relationships, serves as a mediating factor between social support and perceived health in the elderly and can have positive effects on fighting aging
 jivan ke antim daur kii ichchhaaon kaa saamana karne ke liye bujurgon main dharm ek mahatvapurn kaarak hota he or jivan ke ant main kisi or kaarak kii tulana main kahin adhik prakat hota he
 Religious commitment may be associated with lower mortality, although religiosity is a multidimensional factor; While participation in religious activities may be reduced in the sense of participation in ceremonial and organized rituals, it may be more informal, but still remain an important aspect of life in the form of private or personal prayer
 swasthya ke swa-moolyankan, yah vishwaas ki meri apni sehat shandaar, thik yaa kharaab he, ko bujurgon ke swasthya or mrityu dar se joda gaya he; sakaaratmak reating achche swasthya or kam mrityu dar se judi he

 According to the Mahabharata, this river emerged from the humid leather amount collected in the yajnas of King Rantideva - 'mahanadi Charmarasherutkledatat sasrijayathatasharmarmatiyatheya and the famous Mahanadi'

 Jain literature is very vast
 adhikansh main vah dharmik sahitya hi he
 This literature has been written in Sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages
 mahavir kii pravritiyon kaa centre magadh rahaa he, isaliye unhone yahan kii lokbhasha ardhamagadhi main apana upadesh diya jo uplabdh jain aagmon main surakshit he
 These are 45 and consider Shwetambara Jain evidence, not Digambara Jain
 dingbaron ke anusaar aagam sahitya kaaldosh se vicchhinn ho gaya he
 Digambara accepts the hetkhandagam which has been considered part of the 12th Anglicism
 digambaron ke pracheen sahitya kii bhashaa shauraseni he
 Later, Jain pundits enriched the language literature by writing their compositions in the later folk-languages of Apabhransh and Apabhransh
 adikalin sahitya main jain sahitya ke granth sarvaadhik sankhya main or sabase pramanik rup main milte hai
 Jain creators composed a variety of texts like Purana poetry, Charit poetry, Katha poetry, Ras poetry
 swayambhu, pushp danta, hemchandra, somprabh suri aadi mukhya jain kavi hai
 He also made the folk tales prevalent among Hindus the subject of his creations and showed his culmination to be different from tradition
 jain-sahitya kaa pracheenatam bhaag ‘aagam’ ke naam se kaha jaataa he
 These proceeds are 46- aagam granth kaaphi pracheen he, tathaa jo sthaan vaidic sahitya kshetra main veda kaa or buddha sahitya main tripitak kaa he, vahi sthaan jain sahitya main aagmon kaa he
 In the Agam texts, there is a compilation of many stories and stories related to the teachings of Mahavira and Jain culture
 jain parampara ke anusaar mahavir nirvana ke 160 varsh pashchaat magadh deshon main bahut baari dushkaal padaa, jiske falswaroop jain bhikshuon ko anyatra vihaar karnaa padaa
 At the end of the period, Shramana gathered in Pataliputra and eleven organs were compiled piece by piece, the twelfth organ was not remembered, so it could not be compiled
 is sammelan ko 'patliputra-vaachana' ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 After some time, when the Agama literature began to be severed again, the second conference of Jain monks took place after 827 or 840 years of Mahavir Nirvana
 ek aryaskandil kii adhyakshata main mathura main tathaa doosraa nagarjun suri kii adhyakshata main valbhi main
 The conference at Mathura has been called 'mathuri-vachana'
 tatpashchaat lagbhag 150 varsh baad, mahavir nirvana ke 980 yaa 993 varsh baad valbhi main devardhigani kshamashraman kii adhyakshata main saadhuon kaa chauthaa sammelan hua, jisamen suvyavasthit rup se aagmon kaa antim baar sankalan kiya gaya
 It is called by the name of 'valabhi-vachana'
 vartmaan aagam isi sankalana kaa rup he
 The history of the above three conferences of the Jain Agama shows that Agama literature suffered from time to time, and this literature in its original form could not remain secure
 yahi kaaran maaloom hota he ki baudhon ke vipul sahitya ke mukaable yah sahitya bahut nune he, tathaa is sahitya main vikaar aa jane se hi sambhavtah digambar sampradaay ne ise maananaa asweekaar kar diya
 This literature depicting the economic and social condition of India from the fourth century BC to the fifth century CE is of importance in many respects
 ayaarang, sooyagdan, uttarajaiyan, dasveyali aadi granthon main jo jain bhikshuon ke aachaar-vichaaron kaa vistrut varnan he, vah baudhon ke dhammapad, suttanipat tathaa mahabharat aadi granthon se bahut anshon main mail khaataa he, or dow
 vinternij aadi vidwaanon ke kathananusaar vah shraman-kavy kaa pratik he
 In terms of language and subject etc
, this part of Jain proceeds seems to be the oldest
 bhagwati kalpasutra, ovaiy, thanang, niryavali aadi granthon main shraman bhagavan mahavir, unki charya, unke upadeshon tathaa tatkaaleen raja, rajkumaar or unke yuddh aadi kaa vistrut varnan he, jisase jain itihaas kii luptpraaya anek anushrutiyon kaa pataa lagata he
 Nayadhammakha, Uvasagadasa, Antagadadasa, Anuttarovvaiyadsa, Vivagasuya, etc
, have many stories and stories told by Mahavira and his disciples, in which many things related to Jain tradition are introduced
 rypanesi, jeevabhigam, pannavna aadi granthon main vaastushastra, sangeet, vanaspati aadi sambandhi anek mahatvapurn vishyon kaa varnan he jo praayah anyatra uplabdh nahin hota he
 Aanthasutras have a detailed description of the dieting and atonement etc
 of the sages, which can be compared with the Vinayapitaka of Buddhists
 vrihatkalpasutra main bataaya gaya he ki jab mahavir saket subhumibhag naamak udyaan main vihaar karte the to us samay unhone apane bhikshu-bhikshuniyon ko saket ke purv main ang-magadh tak dakshai ke kaushambi tak, tathaa uttar main kunala tak vihaar karne kii anumati di
 This shows that initially the propagation of Jainism was limited, and Jain Shramans could not go elsewhere except Magadha and parts of Uttar Pradesh
 nissandeh chhedsutron kaa yah bhaag utana hi pracheen he jitne swayan mahavir
 Subsequently, Jain inscriptions of Mathura, contemporary to King Kanishka, mention different ganas, clans and branches, they often coincide with the ganas, clans and branches mentioned in the Kalpasutra of Bhadarwahu
 isse bhi jain aagam granthon kii pramanikta kaa pataa chalata he
 In fact, till this time, the difference between Shwetambar and Digambar is not known in Jain tradition
 jain aagmon ke vishay, bhashaa aadi main jo pali tripitak se samanta he, vah bhi is sahitya kii pracheenta ko dyotit karti he
 Like the fables of Pali Sutras, several commentaries, commentaries, Deepika, retirement, description, Avachoori etc
 have also been written
 is sahitya ko saamanyata niryukti, bhashya, churni or tikaa-in chaar vibhaagon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he, aagam ko milakar ise 'paanchangi' ke naam se kehete hai
 Like Agama literature, this literature is also of great importance
 isamen aagmon ke vishay kaa vistaar se pratipaadan kiya gaya he
 There are many recommendations in this literature, which are historically very important
 vrihatkalpbhaashya, vyavahaarabhashya, nishithchurni, aavashyakchurni, aavashyaktikaa, uttaradhyayan tikaa aadi tikaa-granthon main puraatatv sambandhi vividh saamagree bhari padi he, jisase bharat ke reeti-rivaaj, meley tyohaar, sadhu-sampradaay, dushkaal, baadh, chor-lutere, saarthwah, vyapaar ke maarg, shilp, kala, bhojan-shaastra, makaan, aabhushan, aadi vividh vishyon par bahut prakaash padataa he
 This literature is also very important in terms of folklore and philology

 meley kisi bhi samaaj ke na sirf logon ke milan ke avasar hote he varan samskruti, rosemare kii aavashyaktaa kii purti ke sthal va vichaaron or rachanaaon ke bhi samya sthal hote hai
 The nature of fairs of mountain society is also a center of attraction in itself
