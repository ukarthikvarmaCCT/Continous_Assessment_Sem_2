 Stanford science went through three phases of experimental direction during that time
 In the early 1950s, the department remained fixed in the traditional independence and self-directed research mode, eschewing interdisciplinary cooperation and excessive government funding
 In the mid-1950s and mid-1960s, the focus of biological research was shifted between the molecular level
 Then, from the late 1960s onward, Stanford's goal became the pursuit of experimental research and humanistic completion
 Each phase was prevented by major social issues, such as the rise of the Cold War, the introduction of Spatnik, and public concern over the increasing misuse of medicine

 kahani kii shuruyaat lakshmi or gayatri ke vivaah se shuru hoti he jo ki ek khushhaal or bhaagyashaalee danpati hai
 Lakshmi loved his wife immensely and was willing to do anything for her
 masik dharm ko lekar gaanv main ek roodhiwaadee soch ke chalate us dauraan gayatri ko ghar kaa kaam-kaaj nahin karne diya jaataa tha or us paanch din ke dauraan use apane pati se alag baahar duusare bistar par sona padataa tha
 It was also called a 'five-day women's test match' by the youth of the village, about which Lakshmi was completely ignorant, Lakshmi was calm but during menstruation, when she would see her wife Gayatri using old and dirty clothes
 So he does not like it and gets upset
 is vishay par jab vah gayatri se baat karata to vah kahati hai ki iskaa mardon se koi lenaa-dena nahin he or ek mard hone ke naate use auraton ke vishay main dakhal dene kii koi jarurat nahin he, ve unka maamla he ve khud isse nipta lengi
 Despite all this, Lakshmi is no longer there and he goes to the medical store and brings a sanitary napkin of ₹ 55 for his wife
 jab lakshmi use lekar ghar jaataa he or use gayatri ke haathon main detaa he, to gayatri use samajhaati he or use manaa karti he ki prayek maah vah itane mahange pad kaa istemaal nahin kar sakati he
 Lakshmi does not return her
 vah maayoos hokar waapas apane kaam par lautataa he jahaan ek karigar ko chot lag jaati he Lakshmi uses sanitary napkins without any thought to her injury so as to reduce blood flow
 vahiin duusari ore anya log ise 'apavitra' maanate hai
 Laxmi then immediately rushes the artisan to the hospital where the doctor compliments Laxmi and says that using sanitary napkins is a better option to stop the bleeding
 lakshmi bahut khush hota he or use ek upaay sujhata he
 Then he takes some cotton, cloth and glue from his friend so that he can make short-term pads that are not too expensive
 apane dwaara banaae gaye is pad ko vah gayatri ko prayog karne ke liye detaa he
 But Lakshmi's plan fails, due to which Gayatri's clothes get spoiled at night and she tries to wash her sari overnight and remove her stains
 gayatri ek baar phir lakshmi ko auraton ke maamle main dakhal na dene ko kahati hai
 Lakshmi ignores his words and secretly gives a girl in her neighborhood to use the pad she has made, which then causes a localism
 phir uski mulaakaat ek medical kii chaatra se hoti he, jo ki lakshmi dwaara banaae gaye pad ko istemaal kar uski madad karne ko taiyaar ho jaati he, lekin us chaatra ke dost isse inkaar kar dete hai
 Laxmi visits her again to find out whether her pad is doing her job or not? But the two meet a close relative of Lakshmi, after which Gayatri feels that Lakshmi is having a non-relationship with another woman
 lakshmi rakshabandhan ke avasar par apni bahan ko uphaar swaroop sainitory pad bhent main detaa he, jiske kaaran uski bahan ko apane saas-sasur ke saamne sharmindagi kaa shikaar hona padataa he
 After all these incidents, Gayatri swears to Lakshmi and says that he will not involve anyone in this work
 lakshmi isse baahar nahin aa paata he
 Despite Gayatri's refusal, he again finds another technique and he makes sure that he will use it on his own
 vah apane dost se bakrii kaa khun letaa he or use ek gubaare main bharkar usamen pump jodta he or phir apane upar pad kaa prayog karata he
 But once again his plan fails and his pants are soaked in blood in a public place
 is ghatana ke baad gaanv ke log use pagal ghoshit karte hai jo samaaj main rahane laayak nahin he
 For all these reasons Gayatri's brother takes her away from Lakshmi and then decides to leave Lakshmi village so that she can fight against all these and remove the stigma like menstruation
 lakshmi phir ek kalege main daakhila letaa he taaki use sainitory pads main istemaal kiye gayi chizon kaa pataa lag sake
 Due to food, living and money requirements, he works with a professor so that his daily needs can be met
 professor kaa betaa internet kii sahaayta se sonitory pad se judi har ek jaankaree ekatrit kar lakshmi kii madad karata he
 Through an international company, he asks for some cellulose fiber used for making pads for Lakshmi
 lakshmi dwaara kiye gaye is kaary se professor bahut naaraaz hota he or karodon ke laagat se bane pads banane vaali mashin ke video lakshmi ko dikhaata he taaki vah ise banane se peeche hat jaye
 Despite all this, Lakshmi decides to make pads from her own machine
 wo kuch paise udhaar letaa he or ek adarsh sainitory pad ke jaise bilkul pads banaata he lekin use istemaal kar bataane ke liye uske paas koi nahin hota
 Suddenly he meets the angel, who needs a pad
 zyada raat hone ke kaaran medical kii dukaane bhi band hoti he or phir lakshmi use apane haathon se banaae hue pad detaa he
 The next day Lakshmi goes to Pari and asks Pari about the pad
 pari chaunkati he or bataati he ki vah bilkul ek saadhaaran pad ke jaise hi tha
 There is no place for Lakshmi's happiness upon hearing this and he calls Gayatri to tell this good news
 gayatri phir ise lekar pareshaan ho jaati he or uskaa bhai gayatri ko lakshmi se talaak lene kii baat kar usase dur rahane ko kahata he
 For this amazing invention of Lakshmi, Pari sends her an invitation to the Navodhupad Mela at iit-delhi and tells that the winner will also get a reward of ₹ 2,00,000
 lakshmi ko " jivan badalane ke naye avishkaar" ke sheershak se sammanit kiya jaataa he, or shubhakamanaayen di jaati he
 Leaving his laurels, he diligently tries to bring such cheap pads to the rural women in which the angel helps him
 pari ke saath-saath gaanv kii anya mahilaayein bhi is mishan se judane lagati hai, unhen rojgaar miltaa he
 Lakshmi gives the name of a brand to her manufactured pads under the name of 'pari'
 pad banane ke kaary ko lakshmi or bhi aage badhaata he
 For this bold mission, he comes to UNICEF from New York where he makes his speech 'when women are strong then only the country will be strong'
 ghar waapas aane ke baad use padmashri puraskaar se sammanit kiya jaataa he
 Pari falls in love with Lakshmi but for the happiness of Lakshmi she abandons her emotion
 ek hero ke bhaanti lakshmi kaa swaagat uske gaanv main hota he
 In the film's last, Lakshmi and Gayatri reunite, and the fairy walks away, reminiscing the moments she spent with Lakshmi
