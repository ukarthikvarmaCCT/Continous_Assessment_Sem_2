uparishayi jal ke bhaar se avsaad ko dabane main sahaayta milti he
 As a result, the depressions in the successive rainfall seasons are not quite mixed with the earlier depressions, but accumulate in separate layers
 is kriya ko starikabhavan kehete hai
 The thickness of each layer will depend on the amount of depression that occurs in a rainy season
 ausat main yah 2 se 4 millimetre tak hoti he
 If deposition of depression persists for many years, then obviously some thicker layers will accumulate in place in thinner thin layers, and the thickness of these levels will depend on the speed of depression and the period in which depression deposition continues uninterrupted
 staron main sanchit avsaad ke kanon kii vyavastha par bahaav kii gati or disha kii sthirataa kaa prabhaav bhi padataa he
 Fine clay and fine sand particles remain suspended in water for a long time and sit in a very quiet place
 unka nickshepan bhi apekshaakrit gahare pani main hota he, jahaan dhar ekadam shithil pad jaati he
 In such a state, the system of accumulation of particles remains constant and levels become orderly and regular
 kanon ko jamane ke liye paryaapt samay miltaa he or str samudratah ke samaantar banate chale jate hai
 On the contrary, the place of accumulation of thick sand and gravel etc
 is relatively shallow
 aise sthanon main dhar kii gati bahudhaa parivartansheel hoti he, kabhi mand ho jaati he or kabhi teevr
 In the slow state, the upper part of the accumulated depression begins to flow unfamiliarly in the state of high speed and deposits again where the edge is dim
 is prakaar pun: nickshepit padaarth pehle str ke samaantar nahin hota
 Additionally, in shallow water, where these coarse particles are deposited, the direction of the torrent often changes
 yah parivartan jowarbhata or prachand pawan ityadi ke kaaran hota rahata he
 Therefore, along with the direction of edge, the direction of depressive levels also varies locally
 is prakaar chhichley pani main sanchit avsaadeey shailon ke str bahudhaa samaantar na hokar ek duusare se kone banaate hai, jinaki maap sthaan sthaan par bhinn bhinn ho sakati he
 This phenomenon is called virtual propagation
 kabhi kabhi avsaad kshetron main aisi sthiti hoti he ki jal kii tarangon kii chhap bhi avsaadeey staron main mudrit ho jaati he
 In the shallow regions, especially in the tectonic tropics, the velocity of the waves is so high that the deposited sand and soil dance to their signals and often give them a wave form
 nae avsaad ke aane se purv yadi is tarangit baaluu ko sookhkar kuch ddadh hone kaa avasar mil jaay, to yah tarang rup surakshit rah jaataa he
 Depression often gets an opportunity to dry up and become strong in the state of depression
 isi prakaar kekadon, keedon makodon tathaa anya jantuon ke padchinh bhi jowarbhatantar pradesh main sanchit avsaad main surakshit rah ja sakate hai
 Sometimes traces of rainwater drops also become safe in these depressions
 samudr main rahanevaale naanaa prakaar ke shalkadhari jantuon ke marane ke uparaant unke shalk samudratah main sanchit hone lagate hai
 These flakes are often rolled here and there due to the flow of waves, due to which they break and crumble and join the sand and mud brought by the river
 adhikansh shalk calcium carbonate ke bane hote hai or is prakaar calciummay avsaad, baaluu or mitti banati he
 Levels of pure soil, or sand, are able to accumulate only in places where shark-bearing creatures are often absent
 kabhi kabhi shalk tuutane se purv hi avsaad main dab jate hai or us avasthaa main ve jyon ke tyon surakshit ho jate hai
 In this way, safe shells are called fossils
 samudr ke gahare bhaagon main, jahaan nadi dwaara laai hui baaluu or mitti kaa avsaad nahin pahunch paata he, shalkon ke chure kaa shuddh avsaad nickshepit hota he, jisaki raashi kalantar main bahut prachur ho sakati he
 Thus sand levels accumulate in shallow waters, soil levels in relatively few deep waters, and limestone sedimentary rocks in more deep marine parts
 shushk evam ushnatapradhan deshon main jalawaashpan bahulata se hota he
 If there is a lake in these states in which the amount of burning by the rivers and rainwater is less than that of the steam that blows, then that lake starts drying up and can be completely destroyed
 nadiyon ke pani or varshavah main saadharantaya kuch na kuch lavan ghule rahete hai
 Therefore, new salt material comes in the lake daily by the rivers
 ushnata ke prabhaav se pani bhaap banakar ud jaataa he, parantu lavan peeche hi chhot jaataa he
 Therefore, the water of the lake becomes progressively more salty or saline
 kalantar main lavan itani adhik maatra main sanchit ho saktaa he ki jhil kaa jal usase santrupt ho jaae
 Excess evaporation will cause the salt to dissolve, causing the depression to become salty
 yadi lavan ke avakshepan ke samay nadiyon dwaara laae hue avsaad kii maatra bahut kam ho, to praaia: vishuddh lavniya str avakshepit ho sakate hai
 Many lakes of Tibet are examples of this action
 vahaan varsha bahut kam hoti he, jisase jhilein uttarottar sookhti ja rahi hai or inaki tahon main lavniya str avakshepit ho rahe hai
 In Salt Ranj, Pakistan, deposits of salt and gypsum stored in the state of Khevada will be made by drying of an ancient ocean branch
 isi prakaar vibhinn prakritik abhikartaaon kii kriya se bhu-prishthiya shailon kaa kshay evam apradan nirantar ho rahaa he or usase utpann avsaad antat: samudr ke gart main sanchit hota ja rahaa he
 As the levels of depression increase, the pressure of the new material rises above the lower levels
 praaia: 300 meter mote avsaadeey staron kii daab 80 kilogram prati varg centimetre hoti he
 Therefore, when only 60 meters of mouthed levels are accumulated, the pressure at the lowest levels will often be 13 kg per square centimeter
 jalashay ke pani kii daab bhi kuch kam nahin hoti
 The pressure of water per one meter is 100 grams per square centimeter
 in sabhi daabon ke prabhaav se avsaad ke gun nikatatam aakar aapas main ek duusare se gunth jate hai
 Water escapes between them and they become dry
 jal kii patali patali jhilliyaan kanon se phir bhi chipki rah ja sakati hai or unka tanaav kanon ko paraspar judaa rakhane main sahaayta detaa he
 Generally some salts dissolve in reservoirs or underground water
 When this water flows out of the sedimentary depression, due to some different reasons some of its salts precipitated between the particles of depression, its free radicals are hardened together
 And depression transforms into hard, compact stone
 is prakaar sangyojan karanevaale lavenon main calcium carbonate, louh oxide, evam silica vishesh ullekhneey he
 Of these, silica bond is the strongest
 is prakaar bane hue pashaan kii jati avsaad ke padaarth par nirbhar hogi
 For example, a shell or shell made of sand depression, a combination of a group of buttons will form a conglomerate, etc
 yadi mitti main thodi baaluu ho, to balua shail ityadi shail banenge
 Depression in sea or other reservoirs is accumulated in levels or layers
 daab ke prabhaav se unke sampidit hone evam kisi na kisi lavan tathaa anya aadharak kii sahaayta se avsaad ke kan sanyojit ho jate hai
 Depression in this activity also remains
 avsaad se utpann hone ke kaaran inhen avsaadeey shail bhi kehete hai
 Sedimentary rock material accumulates in the bottom of the sea or other reservoirs for a long time
 kalantar main bhusanchalan aadi kisi vrut ke prabhaav se vah sagar kii tah main se upar uthakar, parvat kaa rup dhaaran kar, mahadesh kaa bhaag ban saktaa he
 This is a catastrophic change
 aisa hone se avsaadeey padaarth pun: prakritik abhikartaaon kii kriya kii prishthbhumi banaata he or unke prabhaav main aakar phir se kshay hota hua nae avsaad ko janm detaa he, jo tatkaaleen sagar kii tah main jaakar nickshepit hone lagata he
 In this way, the substance of the earth is continuously participating in a depressive cycle
 prayek chakra ke ant main sagar or mahadeshon kaa punassanthaan hota he or inamen nae thal or jal bhaagon kaa nirmaan hota he
 Usually 4 large and 14 short cycles of this type have occurred in the entire history of the Earth

 Bithoor, situated on the banks of the Ganges, 15 km from the city of Kanpur, is a place of religious attraction every year, but a big fair is held here on the day of Kartik Purnima
 yahaan teen din tak chalane vaale meley main hi naulakha haar kii jang shuru hui thi, jo aage chalakar mahoba ke chandel vansh ke bich chhidi aitihaasik ladaai kii mook gavaah bani

 The 'common law' of most Commonwealth countries and the United States is based on this system
 jab vartmaan rashtrakul deshon main britani samrajya tha, us samay ye kanoon in deshon main lagu kiye gayi or ab tak chal rahe hai

 In the 12th century, English law was divided into three different branches - west-saxon, American and Denny
 narman logon ke paas apni koi suvyavasthit vidhi pranali nahin thi or jo kuch unka apana kehane ko tha bhi vah angreji vidhi pranali ke samaksh naganya tha
 Therefore the Norman law could not invalidate English law

 Brahma is first mentioned in verses 5
1 called Kutsayana Stotra
 phir chand 5
2 isaki vyakhya karata he
 The Sarveshvarist Kutsayana Stotra says that our soul is Brahman and this ultimate truth or God is present within all beings
 yah aatma kaa brahma or unki anya abhivyaktiyon ke saath is prakaar sameekaran karata he: tum hi brahma ho, tum hi vishnu ho, tum hi rudra ho, tum hi agni, varun, vaayu, indra ho, tum sab ho
 In verses 5
2, Vishnu and Shiva are compared to the concept of virtue
 yah kahata he ki granth main varnit gun, maanas or janmajaat pravritiyaan sabhi praaniyon main hoti hai
 This chapter of the Maitri Upanishad claims that the universe emerged from darkness
 jo pehle aaveg ke rup main ubhara tha par baad main pavitrataa or achchhai main badal gaya
 Then it compares Brahma to Rajas in this way: phir uskaa wo bhaag jo tamas he, he pavitra gyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon, rudra he
 The part of him who is Rajas, o students of sacred knowledge, is Brahma
 uskaa wo bhaag jo satva he, he pavitra gyaan ke vidhyaarthiyon, vishnu he
 Actually he was one, he became three, became eight, eleven, twelve and numerous

 This is the soul, in and out, yes in and out

 Trimurti is mentioned in later Puranic literature
 bhagwat puraana main kai baar kaha gaya he ki brahma vah he jo "kaarnon ke sagar" se ubharta he
 
 This Purana says that the moment time and the universe was born, the very moment Brahma emerged from a lotus flower rising from the navel of Hari
 yah puraana kahata he ki brahma nidra main hai, galati karte hai or ve brahmand kii rachana ke samay asthaayee rup se aksham the
 When he became aware of his confusion and sleep, he performed penance like an ascetic, embraced Hari in his heart, then he came to know the beginning and end of the universe, and then his creative powers were revived
 bhagwat puraana kahata he ki iske baad unhone prakruti or purush: ko jod kar chakachaundh kar dene vaali praaniyon kii vividhta banaai
 The Bhagavata Purana also describes the creation of Maya as the work of Brahma

 In this way they supplement Brahma's Rajas
 islamic dharamshastra main imaan islamic dharamshastra ke aadhyatmik pahaluon main ek aastik vishwaas ko darshata he
 The simplest definition of this is the belief in the six articles of faith, known as "araqan al-iman"
 iskaa arth islam ke chah vishwaas ke vishyon main aasthaa rakhana he
 The word Iman is depicted in both the Quran and hadith-e-jibril
 quran ke mutabik, imaan ko dharmik karmon ke saath hona chahie or swarg main pravesh ke liye donon ek saath jaruri hai
 In Jibril's Hadith, the dimensions of Islamic religion form the three "islam", "ihsan" and "iman"
 islam ke bheetar or baahar, dharm main vishwaas or hetu kii charchaa hoti he, or donon ke saapeksh mahatv ko bhulaayaa nahin jaasakata
 Many scholars argue that both originate from a single source and place for trust and reason, so both should be harmonious
 arabi main, imaan, uccharan kaa arth he " vishwaas "
 This verb is a noun, آمن, meaning to believe in something
 haddees main mohammad sahib ne "imaan kaa matlab - dil main gyaan, jeebh par awaz, or haath pair main gatividhi" ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 Faith is a belief in the truth that is real
 jab logon ko vishwaas hota he, to ve khud ko us satya se jod dete hai
 Knowing the truth is not enough, the heart must accept it, it must be expressed by the tongue, which is an expression of wisdom and in the end it is necessary to execute it to reflect their confidence
 hamiduddin faraahi, apane tafseer main imaan ke arth kii vyakhya karte hue, likhaa he: Faith is generally outlined using six articles of faith: inamen se pehle quran or mohammad dwaara pehle paanch kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, jabaki allaah main vishwaas kii ek siddhant shaamil he - bhagwaan dwaara aadeshit bhagya ke achche or bure - ne sabhi chah ko nimnlikhit tareeke se sanderbhit kiya he gabrial ke haddees main: There is another similar description from Muhammad as well: " ebn abbaas ne varnan kiya ki malak jibril ne ek baar paigambar se poocha: "mujhe bataao imaan kya he?" paigambar ne uttar diya: "imaan he vishvas karnaa allaah par, nyaay ke din par, uske malaika par, kitaaben or paigambaron, or mrityu ke baad jivan main vishwaas karnaa he, or swarg or narak main vishwaas karnaa or mizaan kii sthapana par jo hamaare karm ko tolane ke liye he, or taqadir main vishwaas karnaa, iske achche or bure par
 Jibril then asked him: "if i do all this, will i stay with Iman?" The Prophet said: "when you have done all this, you will be in Imaan
 " It is also believed that the essential imaan consists of the first 3 things
 quran main, 10 gunon main se ek gun imaan he jo kisi ko allaah kii dayaa or inaam praptakarta banane ke kaaran miltaa he
 The Quran states that faith can increase with remembrance of Allah
 quran yah bhi kahata he ki is duniya main momin ke liye ati priy chiz vishwaas ke ilaava kuch bhi nahin hona chahie
 Muhammad has said that; He attained the sweetness of faith which led Allah to accept Islam as religion and Muhammad as Prophet
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki jab tak vah apane bacchon, mata-pita or rishtedaaron se zyada paigambar se pyaar nahin karata tab tak koi bhi sachcha aastik nahin ho saktaa
 In another example, he remarks that it is only after falling in love with Allah and Muhammad that a person can become aware of the true taste of faith
 quran ke ek mufassiron amin ahsaan islahi ne is prem kii prakruti arth ko spasht kiya he: 

prem does not merely imply inherently passionate love for one's wife, children and other relatives, but it also refers to love based on certain attitudes and wisdom and principles
 is prem ke kaaran hi ek vyakti, jivan ke har kshetra main, is drushtikon or siddhant ko praathamikta detaa he
 If a man grapples with the demands of his wife, children, and relatives with this approach, he follows it without hesitation, due to this sincere love for the wishes of his wife and children and the demands of his family and clan
 Does
 islahi or maududi donon ne anumaan lagaaya he ki adhyay 14 main ek achche shabd or bure shabd kii quran kii tulana vastav main vishwaas or avishvaas kii tulana he
 Thus, the Quran is effectively comparing faith to a tree whose roots lie deep in the soil and branches spread across the vastness of the sky
 imaan mohammad dwaara allaah se kii gai ek prarthana kaa vishay bhi he: Oh allah! i have rejected myself and handed myself over to you, and i have recognized your magnification and first come to your shelter, running away from you is not going to get anywhere
 agar kahin hai to aapke saath he
 Lord! i have believed in your book which you have revealed and believe in the Prophet whom you have sent as Prophet
 imam al-behaqi apni kitaab shub al-imaan main sankalit kiya he ki vishwaas kii 77 shakhaaen he
 In it, he has explained the essential qualities of faith, mentioning the Quranic imports and the hadiths of the prophet, which reflect the faith
 nimnlikhit haddees mohammad sahib par aadhaarit he: Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said: “iman has more than 70 branches
 in shakhaon main sabase utkrisht" laa elaha illallaah " padhanaa he, or sabase choti shakha raste main padhi baadha ko dur karnaa he
 And Haya is an important branch of Imaan
 " In Islam, it is necessary that harmony and coordination exist between faith and deeds
 faraahi ne is pahalu ko apane tafaseer main nimnlikhit tareeke se samajhaayaa he: Religious deeds are mentioned in the Quran after faith


 In the case of faith, the need for its interpretation is clear: the place of faith is heart and intelligence
 buddhi or dil ke maamalon main, na keval ek vyakti dusron ko dhokhaa de saktaa he balki kabhi-kabhi vah khud dhokhe main rah saktaa he
 He considers himself a Moomin when in fact he is not
 is kaaran se, iske liye do sakshya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he: ek vyakti ke shabd or vyakti ke karm
 Since words can be untrue, a person who claims faith only through words is not considered as a Mu'man and it was considered necessary that a person's deeds also bear witness to his faith
 is prakaar quran ne kaha : he aap jeebh se vishwaas karte hai! apane karmon ke madhyam se vishwaas karo
 The relationship between logic and belief in Islam is a complex debate spanning centuries
 ismail raji al-faaruqi is vishay par bataate hai: non-muslims may oppose the principles of Islam
 haalanki, unhen pataa hona chahie ki islam apane siddhanton ko vishesh rup se vishpasht rup se nahin pesh karata he, jo vishwaas karte hai yaa vishwaas karnaa chaahate hai vah kar sakate hai
 Islam offers this logically, rationally
 yah hamaare paas taarkik or susangat tarkon ke saath aavashyak aadhaaron ke saath pesh karata he
 It is not lawful for us to disagree on the basis of personal taste, or subjective experience
 bhashavigyaan main, sanket prakriyaaon, yaa abhivyanjana or sampreshan, lakshan or pratik kaa adhyayan sanketavigyaan kehalaata he
 It is generally divided into the following three branches: sanketikta ko aksar mahatvapurn maanavshastreey ayaamon sahit dekha jaataa he; udhaaharan ke liye, ambarto iko kaa prastaav he ki prayek saanskrithik ghatana kaa adhyayan sampreshan ke rup main kiya ja saktaa he
 However, some semioticians focus on the logical dimensions of science
 ve prakritik vigyaan se sambandhit kshetron kii bhi jaanch karte hai-jaise ki kis prakaar jeev duniya main apane lakshanik karm sthiti ke bare main bhavishyakathan kar sakate hai or uske anukool ban sakate hai 
 saamanytah, lakshanik siddhant sanketon yaa sanket pranaaliyon ko apane adhyayan ke uddeshy ke rup main lete hai: jivit praaniyon main soochna kaa sampreshan jeev-lakshaniki yaa praani-lakshaniki main aavruth kiya jaataa he
 Syntax is the branch of semiotics that deals with the formal characteristics of signs and symbols
 darasal, vaakya-vigyaan "un niyamon se sambandhit he jo yah shasit kare ki kis prakaar vaakyansh or vaakya banane ke liye shabdon ko joda jaae
" charles morris kehete hai ki arthvigyaan sanketon kaa apane nirdesh or vastuon ke saath ve jo sambandh nirupit kar sakate hai yaa karte hai, ke sambandh se judaa he; or upyogetavaad lakshanikta ke jaiviny pahaluon ke saath sambandh rakhata he, arthath sanketon kii kriya main ghatit hone vaale sabhi manovaigyanik, jaivik yaa saamaajik ghatnaayen
 The term, written in English as semeiotics, was first used by Henry Stubbs in the definitive sense of denoting the branch of medical science related to the presentation of signs
 jon loke ne en esse cansarning human anderstanding ke pustak 4, adhyay 21 main semeiotike or semeiotics shabdon kaa prayog kiya
 In it, he explains how science can be divided into three parts: uske baad loke is teesri shrenee ke swabhaav ke bare main, use Σημειωτικη naam dete hue or nimna shabdon main "sanketon ke siddhant" ke rup main samajhaate hue vistrut karte hai: In the nineteenth century, Charles Sanders Pierce defined what he called a "semiotic" which is "the semi-essential, or formal principle of signs", the essence of which is "


 what must be the characters of all signs used by the intellect Are able to learn by experience "and which follows philosophical logic according to the signs and signs process
 charles morris ne "semiotic" shabd kaa upyog karne main piers kaa anusaran kiya or use maanav sampreshan se pashuon ke seekhney or sanketon ke upyog tak vistrut kiya
 However, Ferdinand de Laussure, looking at a very important area within symptomology, found it related to social science: lakshanshasthri sanketon or sanket pranaaliyon ko unke sanchaar tareeqe ke anusaar vargeekrut karte hai 
 sarthakata kii yah prakriya shabd banane ke liye maanvon dwaara prayukt kuta ke upyog par nirbhar karata he jo vyaktigat swar yaa akshar, apane angavinyas yaa bhaawanaaon se darshane ke liye shaareerik kriyaayein, yaa saamaanya rup se pahane jane vaale vastra ho sakate hai
 To create a word for reference to an object, the community must accept a common meaning in its language
 But that word will only be able to transmit the grammatical structure of the language and the meaning within the code
 The codes also represent the values of culture and are capable of adding new shades of meaning to every aspect of life
 lakshan-vigyaan or sampreshan adhyayan ke bich sambandh ko spasht karne ke liye, sampreshan ko strot se praptakarta ke bich data antaran kii prakriya ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he
 Therefore, communication thinkers build models to explain the biology, psychology, and mechanics involved on the basis of code, medium, and context 
 donon vishay yah bhi maanate hai ki takneekee prakriya ko is tathy se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki praptakarta ko data kaa kutanuwaad karnaa padataa he arthath data ko mukhya ke rup main pahachaanate hue uskaa arth nikaalane main sakasham rahanaa padataa he
 This means that there is essentially an interplay between semiotics and communication
 vastav main, kai avadharanaen saajha kii jaati hai, haalanki prayek kshetra main jor alag hota he
 Messages and Meanings: An Introduction to Semiotics, Marcel Danesi suggests that symptomatologists have had priorities, studies of importance before and communication later
 jin-jequis natiez dwaara ativaadee drushti pesh kii gai, jinhone ek sangeet-shastrajna ke rup main apane lakshanikta ke anuprayog ke liye sampreshan ke saidhantik adhyayan ko apraasangik mana
 Semiotics differs from linguistics in the sense that it generalizes the definition of a sign so that signs can be incorporated into any medium or sensory system
 Thus it increases the prevalence of sign systems and sign relations and gives the definition of language its most elaborate rhetorical or semiotic meaning
 sanketon kii aavashyak visheshtaon ke adhyayan ke taur par shabd "semiotic" ke liye piers kii paribhaasha main use maanav vikaas ke kram main vishwa kii bhashaaon dwaara hasil aakasmik visheshtaon ke adhyayan ke rup main bhashaa vigyaan se alag karne kaa prabhaav shaamil he
 Perhaps it is more difficult to distinguish between semiotics and philosophy of language
 ek myne main, vishyon ke antar kii apeksha yah vastutah paramparaon ke bich kaa antar adhik he
 Various authors have named themselves "philosophers of language" or "semioticians"
 yah antar vishleshnatmak or mahadwipiya darshan ke algaav se mail nahin khaataa he
 Looking closely, some differences can be found with respect to subjects
 bhashaa kaa darshan, prakritik bhashaaon yaa saamaanya taur par bhashaaon par adhik dhyaan detaa he, jabaki lakshanikta kaa sambandh gaiyr bhashaai mahatv se adhik gaharaa he
 Philosophy of language also has a strong relationship with linguistics, while semiotics is close to certain humanities and cultural anthropology
 Semiosis yaa semeiosis aisi prakriya he jo sanketon ke madhyam se duniya ke bare main kisi bhi jeev kii ashanka se arth grahan karte hai
 The importance and significance of signs has been recognized throughout the history of philosophy and psychology
 plato or arestu donon ne sanketon or duniya ke rishton ke bich ke sambandh kaa pataa lagaaya or augustin ne paramparaagat pranali ke antargat sanket ke swabhaav par vichaar kiya
 These theories had a lasting impact on Western philosophy, especially through educational philosophy
 More recently, Umberto Eco has argued in his Semiotics and Philosophy of Language that semiotic theory is rooted in the works of most, possibly all leading thinkers
 is kshetra ke praarambhik vichaarkon main shaamil hai charles dablyoo
 morris
 maiks blike, bartrand rasel ke kaary ko praarambhik maanate hai
 Applications of semiotics include: lakshanikta keval dhire-dhire khud ko ek sammanneey vishay ke rup main sthapit kar rahi he
 In some countries, its role is limited to literary criticism and visual and audio mediums only, but this narrow focus may extend to a broad general study of social and political forces on how active status can be shaped within modern culture
 
 vartmaan jansanchaar ke yug main sanchaar madhyamon ke chayan or sanchaar ranneetiyon kii dizine main praudyogiki niyatatvvaad ke mudde nae mahatv grahan karte hai
 The use of metaphorical methods to reveal various levels of meaning and sometimes hidden purposes has led some to give a hellish look to the elements of the subject as Marxists, Nashists etc
 anusandhan kaa prakaashan samarpit patrikaon main hua he jaise ki juri lotman dwaara santhaapit or tartu uniwarsity press dwaara prakashit sin system studies ; thomas e
sebiok dwaara santhaapit or mouton de gruitor dwaara prakashit semiotica ; zeitsharift far semiotic ; european jarnal of semiotics ; varsas or anya; american jarnal of semiotics or anya vishyon kii patrikaon main sweekrut lekh, visheshkar darshan or saanskrithik aalochana ke prati unmukh patrikaayen
 Semiotics has produced several subfields, including but not limited to: sachitr lakshanikta kala ke itihaas or siddhant ke saath antarang rup se judi he
 However, it has moved ahead of both in at least one fundamental way
 jahaan kala ke itihaas ne uske drishy vishleshan ko chitron kii kam sankhya tak simit rakhaa he, jo "kalatmak rachana" ke rup main arhata rakhte hai, sachitr lakshanikta ne aam taur par chitron ke lakshanon par dhyaan kendrit kiya he
 This traditional history and theory of art — and at the same time, diverging from other major streams of semiotic analysis — allows for a wide variety of possibilities for pictorial semiotics
 ghatana-kriya vishleshan, sangyanatmak manovigyaan, sanrachanaatmak or sangyanatmak bhashaa-vigyaan tathaa drishyaatmak maanav-shaastra / samaaj-shaastra se kuch prabhaav grahan kiye gaye hai
 Diet has been a favorite traditional subject to illustrate semiotic theory, as it is highly accessible and can be easily linked to the life of the average person
 lakshanikta sanket prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan he, jab vah vyaktigat rup se yaa samoohon main sanchalit hota he or kis prakaar ye sanket prakriyaayein arth ko parichaalit karne or saath hi samajhane main antardrushti pradaan karti hai
 Diet is called symbolic because it changes its meaning when prepared
 ek junglee jaanavar dwaara laash se khaae gaye aahaar kii tulana kisi saanskrithik pakwaan kaa pratinidhitiv karne ke liye rasoighar main maanvon dwaara taiyaar aahaar se kiye jane par spashtatah arth badal jaataa he
 Food can also be called a symbol of some social gestures
 "agar khaadya padaarth ko ek sanket-paddati ke rup main vyavahrut kiya jaataa he, to jo sandesh vah kutabaddh karata he vah abhivyakt saamaajik sambandhon ke pattern main paaya jayega
 sandesh padanukram kii vibhinn shrenee, samavesh or bahishkaran, simaaen or simaaon ke paar len-dein ke bare main he"
 The diet is symbolic without regard to how it is prepared
 chaahe bhojan ko kisi achche dining restaraan main puri parishuddhta ke saath taiyaar kiya gaya he, yaa kooday ke dher se uthaaya gaya he, todaa, niglaa, yaa junglee jaanavar dwaara khaaya gaya he, tab bhi hameshaa hi is aadhaar par arth nikaala ja saktaa he ki kisi vishisht aahaar ko kaise taiyaar kiya gaya or kis sandarbh main use parosa gaya
 Current research has found that, as branches develop and become more international, their symbols become more symbolic and less iconic
 kisi sanket kii pratishtha or pratikatmakataa saanskrithik paripati par nirbhar karti he or us aadhaar par ek duusare ke saath sambandhit hai
 If cultural practice has a strong influence on the sign, the sign acquires more symbolic value
