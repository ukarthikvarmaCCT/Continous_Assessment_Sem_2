 a similar rite in North Wales includes a great bonfire called being created for each family on Coel Coeth 'halloween
 Later, members of the house throw a white stone in ashes marked in their names
 Next morning, all the stones Were searched for and if any stones were missing, then the person who threw the stone was supposed to die before next Halloween

 inkaa nijee gurutvkarshan inke dravya ko sanghatit rakhata he
 Scattered like dots of light at night in the cloudless sky, flickering lights show many stars
 kuch chamakate taron ke samooh akaash ko vibhinn bhaagon main baant dete hai
 The group of these stars is called the constellation
 puure akaash ko 89 taramandalon main vibhakt karke un taramandalon ke naam rakh die gaye hai
 The constellations of the zodiac are very famous, their nouns are Aries, Taurus etc
 kisi ek taramandal ke taron ko unke drishy kantimaan ke avaroh kram main chun liya jaataa he
 Asterisks are then named by placing Greek letters next to the constellation's name, such as the brightest star of the Aries zodiac named after the alphabet
 kuch taramandalon main taron kii sankhya itani adhik he ki greek varnmaala ke aksharon kii sankhya unke liye kam pad jaati he
 For naming such strings, we write the former Latin letters of the constellations and numbers if necessary
 kuch taare atiprakashit hone ke kaaran atiprasiddh hai tathaa unke naam taramandalon ke sandarbh ke bina bhi jane ja sakate hen, jaise lubdhak, magha, chitra aadi
 This type of nomenclature helps to identify strings
 khaali aankhon se dekhne par kuch taare adhik chamkile tathaa kuch kam chamkile dikhaai dete hai
 According to their radiance, we classify the stars into several radians
 taare hamase bahut adhik duuri par sthit hai
 We do not see less bright stars as the distance increases
 bina yantra kii sahaayta ke hamaari ankhen chathe kantimaan tak ke taare dekh sakati hai
 The classification of radians is such that the stars appear brightest, their minimums are considered to be the minimum number of stars, less than that of bright stars, and so on
 kantimaan ke taare kii apeksha use purvavarti kantimaan taare kii chamak athwa 2
512 guna adhik hoti he
 In this way, the star of the first radiance is 2
512 times brighter than the star of the second radius and the star of the second radius is 2
512 times brighter than the star of the third radius
 yadi ham chathe kantimaan ke taare kii chamak 1 maan len, to pratham kantimaan se chathe kantimaan tak ke taron kii chamak 100:39
82:15
85:6:31 : 2:51 : 1 anupaat main hogi
 In the measurement of this visual radiance, the sun has a radius of - 26
72, a moon of - 12
5 and a star with a fading star - 1

 mount palomar vedhashala ke 200 inch vyas ke paravarti doordarshee se ham 23 kantimaan tak ke taare dekh sakate hai
 Current measurement means the measurement of the intensity of starlight
 pehle yah kaary vishesh prakaar ke photomeateron kii sahaayta se aankhon dwaara kiya jaataa tha
 The records obtained in this way are called visual records
 ankhen pile prakaash kii sugrahi hai, at: drishyakantimaan pile or hare rang ke prakaash ke maapak hai
 Later the decoction was done with the help of photography plates
 is prakaar se gyaat kaantikan ko photography kantimaan kehete hai
 Photographic currents are measures of blue light
 taare kai rangon ke prakaash vikeern karte hai
 Therefore, the intensity of light is measured by sensitized plates of different colors and by the use of pigments to determine the strength of stars
 pile rang kii sugrahi platon par pile rangashodhakon se photography tathaa drishy kantimanon ke antar ko varna suchak kehete hai
 This determines the temperature of the wires
 kantimaan photograhi selon par prakaash ko grahan kar tathaa use bahugunit kar prakaash kii tivrata maapi jaati he
 While measuring current we also have to keep in mind the effect of the atmosphere and the effect of the interstellar dust and gases of the stars
 kantimaan ke yatharth gyaan se hamen taron kii dooriyaan tathaa bahut se bhautik padaartho ko jaanane main sahaayta milti he
 The personal light of many stars is very high, but due to being stationary at a great distance, their visible record is more visible
 yatharth kantimaan to tabhi gyaat ho saktaa he, jab ve upamaatr se samaan duuri par sthit hon
 All the stars are imagined at a distance of 10 parsecs, and the known value is called absolute value
 yadi hamen taare kaa drishy kantimaan gyaat ho tathaa uski duuri gyaat ho to ham nimnlikhit sutara se nirpeksh kantimaan jaan sakate hai: 5â€“ 5 logarithmic distances are in the parsecs
 vilomat: yadi hamen nirpeksh kantimaan gyaat ho to ham taron kii dooriyaan bhi jaan sakate hai
 The absolute record of the Sun is 4
7
 kisi taare kii surya ke saapeksh kanti ko saapeksh kanti kehete hai
 In this, the radian of the Sun is assumed to be 1
 is prakaar ke adhyayan se ham taron se praapt honevaali urja kaa adhyayan karte hai, jisase unki bhautik sthitiyon ke adhyayan main sahaayta milti he
 No 8 no purnataya nirmal akaash main hamen drushti sahaayak yantron ke 3,200 se adhik taare nahin dikhalaai padate
 Since we can see only half of the sky, the number of microscopic stars is about 6,500
 inamen 20 stars brighter than 1,5 radiance 2 kantimaan tak chamkile 50 taare hai 150 stars up to 3 radiant 4 kantimaan tak chamkile 500 taare hai Tara 5 shines to 1500 bright stars shesh chakshudrishy taare chathe kantimaan ke he
 If we make our vision 10 times inward, then the number of visible stars will increase by 1000 times, that is, if the stars are assumed to be spread evenly, then their number will increase by six times their distance
 yah sambandh adhik chamkile taron tak hi simit he
 The number of stars known by the largest telescope in a lesser galaxy is about 1, xxwrep 2 00, 000
 taare kii vaastavik gati tathaa gamandisha gyaat karne ke liye ham uski gati ko do bhaagon main baant lete hai
 The angular value of the motion of the perpendicular direction on the sight is called the private motion of the star
 taron kii nijee gatiyaan kam hotin hai
 In order to find them we have to compare the photographs of stars taken in very distant times
 jo taare hamaare nikat hai, ve doorvarti taron ke saapeksh aage peeche hat jate hai
 By dividing this angular value by the interval of time, the individual speeds become known
 is koniya drushtisutra kii disha kii tarak gati ko traigy veg kehete hai
 To find the radial velocity, we take the spectrum of stars with the help of spectroscopy
 yadi varnakram rekhaayen nile chor kii taraf hati hon, to ham dopalar sidwant kii sahaayta se jaan lete hai ki tara hamaari ore aa rahaa he tathaa, yadi varnakram rekhaayen laal chor kii ore hati hon, to ham se dur ja rahaa he
 The transfer of lines is inversely proportional to their triangulation
 banard ne ophiukas taramandal ke ek dashm kantiman ke taare kii nijee gati 10
3 prati varsh gyaat kii he, jo vishaltam he
 Knowledge of private motion is helpful in the study of the stars and from this we also know that the stars of more blue motion are relatively closer to us
 traigy veg kaa surya ke saapeksh gyaan karne ke liye, hamen prithvi kii gati ko bhi dhyaan main rakhana padataa he
 The knowledge of private motion and radial velocity makes the actual speed and its direction known by the principle of force-parallel-quadrilateral
 taron kii dooriyaan gyaat karne ke liye trikoshmetiya vidhiyon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 The star closest to us is also at such a distance that if we consider the diameter of the Earth as its base, then they seem to be parallel, that is, the parallax of the star is zero
 at: taron ke lamban ko gyaat karne ke liye hamen bade aadhaar kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Therefore, we base the diameter of the Earth's orbit
 yadi ham kisi taare kii disha ke ek vedh ke chha: maheene baad uskaa vegh karen to hamen prithvi kii kaksha ke vyas kaa aadhaar mil jaataa he
 With this type of perforation, the nearest stars show slight changes relative to the distant stars
 ise nikaalte samay hamen taare kii nijee gati ke prabhaav par bhi vichaar karnaa padataa he
 Even then it is so low that the parallax of the nearest star is 76
 yadi kisi taare kaa lamban 1 ho to vah prithvi se prithvi kii kaksha kii trigya se 2,06,265 guni duuri par hota he
 This distance is called a parsec
 duuri maapne ke liye jis anya ikai kaa prayog kiya jaataa he, vah he prakashavarsh 
 The velocity of light is 1,86,000 miles per second
 is veg se prakaash ek varsh main jitani duuri tak jaataa he utani duuri ko ek prakaash varsh kehete hai yah duuri lagbhag 60, xxwrep 2 00, 000 mile hoti he
 a parsec is about 3
26 light years
 trikoshmetiya vidhi se ham keval atyant samipsth taron kii dooriyaan hi gyaat kar sakate hai
 Therefore, to find the distances of distant stars, we have to take shelter of other methods
 yadi ham kisi prakaar taron ke nirpeksh kantimaan ko jaan saken, to ham nirpeksh kantimaan sheershak main die gaye sutara kii sahaayta se unki dooriyaan gyaat kar sakate hai
 Fortunately, we have stars of Cefide and Lyra, whose absolute values we can find
 taron ke lambnon ko gyaat karne kii nimnlikhit anya vidhiyaan hai: These classifications have personal significance and they give us special help in the analysis of stars
 in vargikarnon kaa sankshipt parichay nimnlikhit he: The Sun is our nearest star, which we can study very well
 taron ke tatwon ke adhyayan se hamen adhikansh taare aise uplabdh hote he, jinka janm lagbhag usee samay hua jis samay hamaare surya kaa
 These stars are in descending sequence of temperature, shape and radiance
 is varg ko mukhya anukram kehete hai
 In this, the size of the stars of extreme heat will be about 10 times the size of the Sun and the size of the stars of the lower temperature will be about 10 times the size of the Sun and the size of the stars of the lower temperature will be about the tithe of the Sun
 surya isi anukram kaa ek majhole aakaar kaa tara he, jisaki dravyamatra tathaa taap ausat se kam he
 Upward stars in the curve of the main sequence are extremely rare
 is anukram ke adhikansh taare surya se chote tathaa kam taap ke hai
 The amount of elements available in them is like the Sun
 surya ke adhyayan se ham is varg ke atirikt taron ke do or mukhya varg he: daanavaakar taron ke teen mukhya bhed hai
 Dancing, and leftward stars
 daanavaakar taron ke teen mukhya bhed - daanavkaar, ati daanavaakar tathaa upadanavaakar 
 Extravagant stars are very large in size
 udaahranarth, jyeshtha kaa vyas surya ke vyas kaa lagbhag 300 guna he
 In celestial stars, the diameter of the second beta pigassi of the Khagashv is 170 times the diameter of the Sun and that of the Brahmin is 12 times the diameter of the Sun
 upadanavaakar taare mukhya anukram tathaa daanav varg ke taara ke bich sthit hai
 Left-wing stars also have Vamana, Upavaman, Lalrang Vamana and white-vamana distinction
 in virgon main shwet vamanakaar taare apana vishesh mahatv rakhte hai
 Their specialty is that their mass volume is mid-range and less radiant, but their size is very small and their density is extremely high
 hamen jitne taare dikhaai dete hai, unamem atyadhik maatra main ve taare hai, jo hamaari gallexi ke sadsy hai
 Our Galaxy is a world in itself
 iskaa aakaar sarpil he
 There are many other celestials, which have a spiral shape
 unki rachana tathaa akruti kaa adhyayan karne ke liye hamen apni akashganga ke kuch vishesh prakaar ke taron ke adhyayan se sahaayta milti he
 There are mainly two classes of these stars
 kuch taare sadaa gallexi kii sarpil bhujaaon main uplabdh hote hai tathaa anya gallexi ke nabhik ke nikat paae jate hai
 Among them, the stars of the first class are immediate neighbors of our Sun and the stars of the second class are away from the Sun
 walter wade ne pratham varg ke taron kaa naam pratham tara shrenee, athwa population pratham, tathaa duusare varg ke taron kaa naam dwitiya tara shrenee, athwa population dwitiya rakhaa he
 Both of these types of Taravargo vary in spectral-radius-curves
 pratham tarashrenee ke atyant chamkile taare nile rang ke hote hai tathaa unka nirpeksh kantimaan 7 athwa 8 hota he, jabaki dwitiya tarashrenee ke atyant chamkile taare laal rang ke hote hai tathaa unka nirpeksh kantimaan - 3 yaa usase adhik hota he
 In the stars of the first star, there is an excessive amount of interstellar gas and dust, while in the stars of the second star it is very small
 in tarashreniyon ke adhyayan se hame gallexion kii sarpil bhujaaon tathaa nabhikon ko nishchit karne maatr ke hi liye nahin, kintu inase hamen taron kii utpatti tathaa vikaas kii sthiti kaa adhyayan karne main bhi sahaayta milti he
 Molecules of the mass of stars, which remain neutral in the atmosphere, become ionized due to the progressive increase in temperature and they lose more and more of their negative electrons
 iske prabhaav se aise taron ke varnakram main bananevaali chamakili or kaali rekhaon main vibhinnata aa jaati he
 In other words, the lines represent the different states of heat of the molecules that radiate the light of stars
 is prakaar taron ke varnakramon ke adhyayan se unke mukhya 10 bhed kiye gaye hai, jinhen roman lipi ke bade aksharon o, bi, e, epa, ji, ke, em, aar, en, tathaa es se vyakt karte hai
 Since alphabetical classification is related to temperature, the smaller alphabet a to e of the English alphabet is placed after o for strings of o spectrum and O, to show successive degradation of the temperature of the same class of stars
 Oba etc
 isi prakaar ke abhipraay ko vyakt karne ke liye bi se em ke varnakram ke taron ke liye unke suchak aksharon ke baad 0 se lekar 9 tak ke ank rakhe jate hai
 These are ionized helium stars
 inke varnakramon main ynikrut helium tathaa dohare tihare ynikrut oxigen tathaa nitrogen kii rekhaayen praapt hotin hai
 According to this ionized state, its surface temperature should be from 30, xxrep 4 0 to 40, xxrep 4 0 c or more
 o varnakram ke gyaat taron kii sankhya sau se adhik nahin he, jinamein adhikash nangi aankhon se nahin dekhe ja sakate
 The three stars of this class, Gama Beloram Oy, Zeta Pappis Oy and Zitaorayan, are Oi5 Chakshu Darshan
 ye udasin helium vaale taare hai
 Their surface temperature ranges from 25,000 Â° to 12,000 Â° C
 yah taap yadhyapi helium ko ynikrut karne main asamarth he, tathaapi iske varnakram main ynikrut oxigen rekhaayen uplabdh hotin hai
 Helium and ionized oxygen lines begin to decrease in stars from the B5 star to the lower heat, and hydrogen lines and broad black absorption lines of hydrogen emerge
 hamaari tarasuchiyon main bi taare bahut hai
 These are the major stars of hydrogen
 inkaa prishthiya taap 12,000Â° se lekar 8,000Â° sein0 tak he
 Their number is very high
 kuch jyotishi inhe calcium taare kehete the
 Their surface heat ranges from 8,000 Â° to 6,000 Â° 0
 ye surya kii shrenee ke taare hai
 The lines of ionized calcium in their alphabet are very prominent
 inkaa prishthiya taap 6,000Â° se lekar 4,000Â° sein0 tak he
 12,000 Â° g spectral stars have been identified
 inkaa prishthiya taap 5,000Â° se lekar 3,5000 seinÂ° tak hota he
 Earlier they were known as Suryakalanka stars
 titonium oride taare
 Their surface heat ranges from 3,500 Â° to 2,000 Â° C
 inamen praaia: sabhi chal taare hai, jinamein keval chakshudrishy koi nahin he
 Their surface heat ranges from 3,000 Â° to 5,000 Â° N
 ye sabhi daanavaakar tathaa adhikanshat: chal taare hai
 These are very few in number
 inamen se koi bhi tara keval chakshu se saraltapurvak drishy nahin he
 There are some stars whose radiance keeps decreasing
 inhen chal taare kehete hai
 In order to give clear instructions of movable stars, big letters of English alphabet R, S, t etc
 are placed in front of the constellation, like r SETI etc
 inaki sankhya badhane ke saath ek akshar ke sthaan par do athwa teen akshar bhi rakhane pad sakate hai, yatha aar aar lira aadi
 About 20,000 movable stars are known and they are weighed regularly
 taron ke do vishaal varg hai: pehla bahyahetuk chal tathaa doosraa swat: chal
 Extraterrestrial moving stars are receptive pair stars
 inamen algul tara prasiddh he
 Its normal record is 2
2, but it goes up to 3
4
 swat: chal taare teen shreniyon main rakhe ja sakate hai: sapandansheel chal, visphotak chal tathaa anya chal taare
 Some of these stars have a rotation period of less than a day
 aise taare aar aar lira varg ke hai
 The rotation period of some is from 1 to 50 days
 aise taare sefiid varg ke taare hai
 The rotation period of some stars ranges from 100 to 1000 days
 inhen dirdh aavartkaalik taare kehete hai
 The stars of this class are red colored stars
 kuch taare ardhniyamit chal hai, inkaa chakra 40 se lekar 150 din tak kaa he
 These stars are also red colored stars
 inamen aar aar lira tathaa sefiid taare atyant mahatvapurn hai
 r Lyra stars got its name because all of these properties are similar to the moving star described in Lyra Planetarium, which was named RR Lyra
 naam se yah na samajhnaa chahie ki aise taare keval lira taramandal main hi hote hai, kintu is shrenee ke taare hamaari gallexi tathaa anya tarapranaliyon aadi main sarvatra hai
 The reason for the importance of these stars is their distancing
 aar aar lira varg ke taron main aavartankaal ke badhane par par bhi unke nirpeksh kantimaan main antar nahin padataa
 This means that if one of the galaxial stars has RR Lyra stars, they will be of the same absolute radius and it is almost equal to zero of the same absolute radius
 aisi avasthaa main unke drishy kantimaan ke gyaan se unki duuri nimnlikhit sutara dwaara gyaat ho sakati he
 Absolute radius = visual radius + 5 - 5 logarithmic distance inkaa yah naam isliye padaa ki inaki prakruti delta sefius, athwa chartuth kapish, kii tarah kii he
 The fourth Auburn is the brightest star in the Cepheid category, which can be seen from the eye
 sefiod taron kaa aavartankaal ek din se kuch adhik se lekar 45 din se kuch adhik he
 Our galaxy's cepheid stars often have a 7-day rotation period
 sefiid taron kii sabase badi visheshta he inkaa aavartankaal-kanti-saahchary niyam se sangat hona
 This means that as the growth period of the cepheid wires increases, their absolute value increases
 yah sambandh atyant mahatvapurn he
 With its help, the distance can be determined by the previous formula by knowing the absolute value of the safe stars
 sefiid taron kii sahaayta se taragucchon tathaa tarapaddatiyon kii duuri gyaat kii jaati hai
 The reason for the change of thermogenic color is generally assumed to be the flutter principle, which means that the rotation of the surface of the cepheid wires causes growth and depletion, causing the star to expand and shrink sequentially
 vastut: spandan siddhant sabhi sthitiyon kaa yatharth uttar nahin detaa
 Therefore, nowadays astrologers are beginning to understand that the different positions of cefoid stars are due to the change of their temperature, which itself is an iterative cycle
 1,000 se adhik sefiid taare gyaat he
 Such wires explode regularly or irregularly
 ye taare saamanyat: atyant dhundle hote hai, kintu visphot hone ke baad inaki kanti atyant asaadhaaran rup se bad jaati he
 After this situation lasts for a few days, the stars fall into their normal radius
 is prakaar ke taron ko navtara kehete hai
 In 1918, the glow of the Navatar of Aquila Tarapunja had increased by forty thousand times within four days
 anya prasiddh navtare hai: parasyus taramandal kaa navtara, 1925 i0 victoris navtara tathaa 1934 i0 kaa harkulis taramandal kaa navtara
 Those who become very exceptionally bright after the Navatarite explosion are called Atinavatara
 1885 i0 ke andromida niharika ke atinavtaare ne chah dinon main itnaa adhik prakaash vikeern kiya ki surya kadachit utane prakaash ko 10 lakh varsho main vikeern kar paaegaa
 Other types of moving stars are often of irregular rotation
 kisi svachh raatri main akaash main kuch dhundle prakaash ke dhabbe se dikhaai dete hai
 If we look at them with powerful instruments, then we find three types of things: star flakes, nebulae and galaxies
 niharikas chamakili gaison se bani hai tathaa aakashgangaayen hamaari gallexi kii tarah swatantra tarapranaliyaan hai
 There are two types of star flakes, one that is available in the sky-like plane, or near the celestial spiral arms
 aise guchchhe akashgangeey guchchhe kehalaate hai
 The number of stars in these is relatively less
 is prakaar ke varg main krittika tara guchchhe atyadhik chamkila tathaa bada he
 The globular globules lie away from the spiral arms and near the nucleus
 golakaar taragucchon main apekshaakrit atyaadhik taare rahete hai
 They are often seen with a twist
 inhen doordarshiyon se hi dekha jaataa he
 The Ombanga Sentari and 47 Tukane Panchal Kantiman, Chakshudhishyas, are related to the population of the spherical galaxy
 avashya hi inase taron ke vikaas kii avasthaaon kaa gyaan hota he
 The distance of the cluster is determined with the help of the RR Lyra and cepheid wires present in these wires
 inke adhyayan se gallexi ke swaroop ke adhyayan main bahut sahaayta milti he
 Most stars are double, or majority, they do not have anything interconnected in pairs of stars, but they appear very close because they are located towards our line of sight
 aise taron ko chakshush, dohare taare kehete hai
 Such stars are few
 adhikansh taare vastut: ek yaa adhik taron ke saath hai
 Two stars, which travel in a certain type of longitudinal path with mutual attraction, are called star-pairs
 yah nishchay ho jane par ki koi tara vastut: yugma hai, ham uske sambandh kii bahut si baaten gyaat kar sakate hai, kyonki uski, athwa uske saathi tara kii, gati vyapak gurutvkarshan niyam kaa paalan karti hai
 The speed and mass of the pair wires can be determined with certainty
 yugmatare mukhyatya teen prakaar ke hote hai: drishy, grahauakari tathaa varnakrameey 
 To know the class of visual pair, one has to weigh their distance and angle of view
 adhikansh drishy yugmataron kaa parikramankal bahut lanbaa hota he, jise gyaat karne ke liye saikadon varshon tak vegh kii aavashyaktaa he
 Therefore, although more than 25,000 visual pairings have been known, the knowledge of more than 200 orbits is not yet known
 grahauakari yugmatare ke sahchar kii kaksha praaia: hamaari drushtirekha kii disha main thode se jhukaav se rahati he, jisase ek tara duusare ko purnataya yaa khandash: dhak letaa he or isse ek taare kaa prakaash hamen dikhaai nahin padataa
 This allows the pair to be identified, because in normal conditions, the amount of light that this star has remains at the time of eclipse decreases
 yah grahan kii sthiti niyat samay se hotin hai
 In such strings, the Beta percussion, that is, Algool, is very famous
 saamaanya avasthaa main iskaa kantimaan 2
2 hota he, ja grahan ke samay 3
4 rah jaataa he
 After the eclipse, its record becomes 2
2 again
 kuch yugmataron ke sahchar kii kaksha kaa samtal prithvi ke sameep se nahin jaataa, at: ham uske grahan kii sthiti nahin dekh sakate hai
 But by changing the lines of its spectrum, we get to know that this star sometimes comes towards us and sometimes goes away from us, so that it is clear that it is flying around an invisible star
 aise taare varnakrameey yugmataron kaa parikraman kaal kam hota he
 Classes of about 309 spectral stars have been known
 taron ke aakaar praaia: teen vidhiyon se jane jate hai: From absolute temperature and temperature, grahauakari yugmataron ke grahankaal se tathaa By interferometer
 pratham vidhi plank ke nimnlikhit sutara par aadhaarit he: View Absolute Record Mvis = - 5 log - 0
08 jahaan r = taare kii trigya he
 The radius relative to its orbit becomes known by the time of eclipse of the eclipse star
 vyatikaranmaapi se taare kaa koniya vyas gyaat ho jaataa he tathaa isaki duuri gyaat hone se iskaa saral rekhaatmak vyas bhi gyaat ho jaataa he
 On the basis of the diameter of the stars, their names are donated and left
 taron kii dravyamatra gyaat karne kii pratyaksh vidhi yugma taron ke sahachaar kii gati kaa adhyayan karne se praapt hotin hai
 The mass quantities of these stars are determined with the help of the law of gravitation
 kisi bhi vaaman taare kii dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra ke dashamansh se kam nahin uplabdh hui hai, tathaa surya se 10 guni se adhik dravyamatra ke taare bhi viral hi hai
 Density of a star = mass / volume
 is prakaar dekhne se pataa chalata he ki daanavaakar taron kaa ghanatv atyant kam hota he tathaa vamanakaar taron kaa atyadhik
 The diameter of a giant star like Jyeshta is 480 times the diameter of the Sun, even if its mass is no more than 20 times the mass of the Sun
 parinamat: iskaa ghanatv surya ke ghanatv ke 
 xxrep 7 0 2 se bhi kam he
 It is also much lower than the density of ordinary air
 shwetavaman taare sirium bi kaa, jisaki trigya surya kii trigya kii 
034 tathaa dravyamatra surya kii dravyamatra kii 86 he, ghanatv itnaa adhik he ki uske dravya ke ek ghan inch kaa bhaar ek ton hoga
 Normally with the help of a photometer, by comparing the density of different colors of starlight with the density of colors already known in the laboratory, the surface temperature of stars can be determined
 kintu iske nishchit rup se gyaat karne kii sarvottam vidhi he, unke prakaash kaa varnakrameey vishleshan
 On the basis of this, there is a spectral classification of stars, which literally signifies their temperature
 taare apni urja nabhikeey abhikriya se praapt karte hai
 Due to the heating of the star's nucleus, the hydrogen atoms of the stars are converted from the nucleus to the atoms of helium
 iske parinaam swaroop taron main atyadhik taap kii utpatti hotin hai, jise ye prakaash ke rup main vikeern karte rahete hai
 They have to lose very little power to generate a lot of energy
 atev inaki dravyamatra main koi baari kami nahin hoti tathaa inkaa jivan bhi karodon varshon kaa ho jaataa he
 The atmosphere of stars is also studied by the lines of the spectrum
 surya ke vayumandal ke adhyayan se hamen pataa chalaa he ki isamen hydrogen atyadhik maatra main hai
 The second place is of helium
 anya tatv kam maatra main hai, tathaapi magnesium or oxigen ke parmaanu nishchit rup se vidyaman hai
 Of the known chemical elements, 61 elements have been identified in the Sun's atmosphere
 adhikashan taron kaa vayumandal surya sareekha he, tathaapi sabhi taron kaa vayumandal bilkul ek sa nahin he
 There is a difference between the amounts of carbon and oxygen in them
 taron ke mul tatwon ko unke varnakram kii rekhaon ke adhyayan se janaa jaataa he
 In the laboratory, the spectrums of the different basic elements are taken, and by matching them to the spectrum of the stars, the basic elements available in the stars are identified
 is prakaar ke adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki ausat taron main lagbhag 70 heidrogen, 28 helium, 1
5 carbon, nitrogen, oxigen tathaa niann or 0
5 loh varg ke tathaa anya baari tatv hote hai
 The heavy element population first wires have about 3 and the population second ones have less than 1
 taron kaa janm taron ke antarvarti gas tathaa dhul ke kanon se hota he
 The electrophoresis of gas clouds usually remain in a neutral state, but when a very hot star moves near them, they ionize and move and form a nucleus, attracting the masses of gas and dust around them
 Starts wearing huge forms
 gati tathaa sankochan se nabhik kaa taap badhane par, inamen nabhikeey abhikriya prarambh ho jaati he, jisase ye prakaash urja ko vikeern karne lagate tathaa hamen nae taron ke swaroop main dikhalaai dene lagate hai
 Studies of the energy radiations of various types of stars have shown that the stars of Population II are very ancient and the stars of Population i are relatively later
 taron ke jivan se taatpary unke prakashmay jivan se hota he
 The basis of the light of stars is their reserves of hydrogen, from which they receive heat energy by nuclear reaction
 jo taare atyadhik chamkile hai, swabhaavat: ve apane hydrogen ke bhandar kaa adhikadhik upbhog karke use adhik shighrata se helium main parivartit karte rahete hai
 Although stars can regain their heat energy for many years by shrinking their hydrogen reserves, their main basis of life depends on their hydrogen intake
 jo taare atyadhik chamkile dikhalaai dete hai, unka jeevankaal 109 varsh ke lagbhag tathaa mukhya anukram ke dhundle taaro kaa jeevankaal 1013 varsh ke lagbhag hota he
 The life of the Sun is about 1010 years
 apane chaaron ore faile hue taramay vishwa ke rahasy ko jaanane kii hamaari ichha bahut puraani he
 By studying the stars, we have found the world to be full of many galaxies like the Galaxy
 laal rang kii ore rekhaon ke sthanrann dwaara hamane taron ke varnakramon ke adhyayan se itnaa jaan liya he ki hamaara vishwa fail rahaa he
 However, due to our limited means, we have not been able to know the true form of the world
 hamaare vishwa kaa kitna vistaar he failata hua vishwa kis seemaa tak fail saktaa he vishwa kii vakrata kisi he, tathaa vakrata trigya kya he ye sabhi prashan abhi tak vivaadaaspad hai tathaa in vishyon main hamaara koi nishchit sarvasammat siddhant nahin he
 The largest mount Palomar Veghshala, a 200-inch-diameter Hale telescope reached one billion parsecs, or about 20, xxwrep 2 00, 00 miles, only for a distance of view Have got

 Therefore, our attention has now reached almost the limit of the radio telescope
 at: ab hamaara dhyaan radio doordarshiyon kii ore gaya he
 In the current progress of scientific development, we hope that the radio visionaries will be able to take us to the unknown mysteries of the world
 vaigyanik tathyon ke baavjood yah akashiya drishy anadikaal se vishwavyaapee vishwaason main mahatvapurn rahaa he
 The Puranichas, ancient mythological and semi-historical chronicles and folklore reveal the prevailing beliefs about this phenomenon
 akaash kii is vilakshan ghatana kaa sabase adhik sambandh bhavishyasuchak vishwasaparampara se aabaddh falit jyotish se he jisamen iske falafal kaa vidhaan kiya jaataa he
 Varahamihira's Brihatsamhita states that those people who pay the fruits of their entire deeds in heaven fall as meteors
 bhavishyavaanee sambandhi vishwaason ke anusaar ulkapaat kahin shubhasuchak he or kahin ashubhasuchak
 But most of the time it is considered ominous as a divine sign of any future accident

 With regard to constellations and stars, this singular superstition is generally prevalent in a wide area of asia, Europe, America and Africa that each star of the sky governs the life and fate of different humans or humans on the earth
 nakshatron ke rup, swabhaav, sthaan tathaa gati kii kalpana ke aadhaar par janmapatri main vyakti ke bhavi jivan kii vyakhya kaa aadhaar yahi vishwaas he jise ek ganitiya yaa vaigyanik paddati pradaan kii gai he
 Their relation to fate can be easily discovered in the meanings of the words 'tara' and 'nakshatra' prevalent in the expression of the said terrain
 isi prakaar kisi taare kaa rang or tej bhi prithvi ke kisi manushya ke swabhaav or bhagyaka pratinidhitiv karata he; saath hi, uske tuutane kaa arth he sambandhit vyakti kaa mrit hona
 According to the legend of the Pune castes, when all the stars are broken, then the human creation will end

 Wavewave or Wavewaveer or Wavewrecked is a sport on the waves of the sea in which the waveleaders ride a wave coming towards the coast while balancing on a pitch
 laharbaazon ke fatton ko 'lahartakhta' yaa 'sarfaboard' kaha jaataa he
 Waves were invented by the indigenous tribes of the Hawaiian Islands and from there it spread worldwide
 khadey hokar kari jane vaali laharbaazi main do prakaar ke lahartate istemaal hote hai: chote takhte or lambe takhte 
 The styles of riding on them are also different from their shape
 kishti se khinch kar kari gai laharbaazi main ek motor-chaalit laharbaaz ko unchi laharon kii ucchtar gati ke baraabar kii raftaar detaa he jo bina naav kii madad ke laharbaaz nahin paa saktaa
 In kite waveform and wind waveform, the force of the wind captures the wavelength
 padalatate or kayake main laharon kii zaroorat nahin hoti or chappu kaa istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In all these, in addition to paddle and wind, the powers of waves can also be used
 kabhi-kabhi shaktishaalee ingine vaali naukaaon ke zariye bhi pani main lehren banaai ja sakati hai or laharbaaz inpar sawari kar sakate hai
 Waves were an important part of ancient Polynesian culture
 san 1767 main 'dolphin' naamak samudri jahaaz main taahiti pahunche europiyon ne pehali dafaa vahaan ke vaasiyon ko laharbaazi karte hue dekha
 In 1769, a team of explorer Captain James Cook on board a ship called 'endeavor' also saw this in Tahiti
 unhone hawaii main bhi laharbaazi dekhi
 Lieutenant James King, a member traveling on it, later returned to England and wrote a description of it in 1779
 1866 main jab america lekhak mark twain ne hawaii kaa daura kiya to unhone likhaa ki "ek jagah ham bahut se nange adivaasiyon ke jhund main aa pahunche, jo donon lingon or har umr ke the or lahar-snaan ke rashtriya khel kaa mazaa le rahe the"
 In Samoa, also placards and daggers were used in ancient times, and there the game was called "fa'ise'a" or "se'eagalu"
 in baaqi polinisian jagahon kii tarah, tonga main bhi laharbaazi hone kaa varnan he
 Continuous wind blowing over open water in a large area like the sea produces a great wave of waves, called anion
 anayan kitna adhik hoga, yah hawa kii gati or bahaav ke kaal par nirbhar karata he
 Because of this, the movement of waves is more where there is less air pressure and where a long coastline is located on the open sea
 hawa kaa sthaneey bahaav laharon par kaafii asar rakhata he
 If a slight or medium wind is moving at a short distance from the shore, then it walks in front of the wave and gives it the shape of a round drum or tube, which is more enjoyable for rippling
 agar hawa zyaada tej ho to pani ko uttejit or laharbaazi ke liye karaab kar detii he
 The sea floor behind and below the wave also has a profound effect on the wave
 pani main agar reef ho to vah laharon ke akar ko badal detii he
 With modern techniques, the floor and air can be measured and can be visualized as to how the waves are going to happen next
 laharbaazon ko tat par jane se pehle yah bhavishyavaaniyaan radio, akhbaaron or internet ke zariye mil jaati hai
 The rule of swells varies according to the weather and location
 sardiyon main jab uttari or dakshini dhruviya agrabhag bumadhya rekha kii ore badhati he to saghan mahatarang madhya-akshansh main utpann hoti he
 Due to the powerful westerly winds moving towards the east, the highest waves on the west coasts of the countries are seen in winter
 lekin madhya-akshansh par hone vaale chakravaat ke silsile vaqt-vaqt par in mahaatarangon ko ooshnakaribandheey kshetron kii taraf dhakel dete hai
 Low pressure areas are also sometimes formed on the eastern coasts of subtropical areas because high pressure winds sometimes reach low speeds
 is se yahan purvi taton par unchi mahaatarange dekhi jaati hai
 In summer, cyclones in the hot region produce heavy swells
 yah chakravaat garm samudr main utpann hote he, isiilie el nino or laa nina chakra se prabhavit hote he
 There is no confidence in the direction of such cyclones
 yah kabhi pashchim ko bhi nikal jate hai jaise ki 1979 main kari chakravaat ke saath hua
 It roamed the Coral Sea and the Queensland Province of Australia for three weeks before vanishing weakly
 vargeekaran maandand In some coastal areas artificial reefs are built to attract wavelength tourists from high waves
 yah pani main ret kii boriyaan yaa koncrit kii badi silliyaan dubo kar banaai jaati hai
 Sometimes a submerged large rook also acts as a reef
 yah reefein na sirf laharbaazi ke liye acchhee hoti he balki bich ko bhi samay ke saath samudr dwaara khaae jane se bachaati hai
 a Turkish ship called 'selly 1' sank in Table Bay in the Cape Town area of south Africa in 2009 and is now making good waves there
 dakshin bharat ke kowalam tat main sthaneey logon ne ek kritrim reef banaai to tat kii raksha kar rahaa he or laharbaazi ke liye acchhee lehren bhi detaa he
 In contrast, an artificial reef called 'chevron Reef' was built off the El Segundo coast of South California, but the hopes of reef builders receded as it did not make good waves
 laharbaaz laharbaazi par aadhaarit ek vividh samskruti kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 Some people practice waveform as an amateur activity, while others consider it to be the central theme of their lives
 sanyukt rajya america ke california, florida or hawaii rajyon main laharbaazi samskruti sabase adhik prabhaavshaalee he
 Things related to this include 'woody' - it is a long stationwagon car on which waves are carried
 laharbaazon ko 'brodshorts' naamak ek lambi nekar bhi pahanani pasand hoti he
 Every year tens of billions of dollars of goods are now bought and sold in the sale of wave related goods
 laharbaazi na karne vaale bhi is khel se sambandhit hone ke liye iske chihn apanaate hai
 Waves classify each other into three categories: laharbaazon kii aapasi baatcheet se bhi bahut se nae shabd paidaa hue hai: Some surfers were so immersed in the game that they had to do something similar even if the favorable waves were not there
 is cheshtaa main unhone takhton ke neeche pahiye lagaakar 'paidalpath laharbaazi' shuru kar di
 It is now called 'skateboarding'
 aage chalakar yah pahadiyon par barf ke upar takhton par bhi khelaa jane laga or is khel kaa naam 'snowbording' padaa
 To ride the wave, the wavelengther makes his way out to the sea off the coast of Lat
 vah apane haathon ko patavaar banaakar tairkar samudr main kuch dur nikalataa he
 Then he turns and faces the coast and tries to match the speed of the wave moving towards the coast, carrying his plank towards that side
 jahaan lahar neeche pani par patake rahi hoti he vahaan pani main jhaag banane se use 'safed pani' kaha jaataa he
 The waveman tries to stay ahead of this white water
 nausikhiyon ke liye lahar ko pakadana hi mushkil hota he, jabaki maahir laharbaaz lahar ko bich main pakadte hai or khadey ho jate hai or phir 'lahar ke kandhe' kii taraf apana takhte ko badhaate hai 
 Novices are often able to climb the shoulders and often fall into the path of expert waveguards
 laharbaazi main maahir use mana jaataa he jo lahar ke badalte rukh ko samajhakar har paristhiti main apane takhte par tikaa rahe or use manachaahi disha main le jane kii kshamta rakhata ho
 Nowadays, a new style of 'air' has also emerged in the wave in which the ripple caught by the wave drops the standing water down on its board and flies in the air for a few moments and then comes down on the wave in a balanced way
 laharbaazi ke is khel main tub kii sawari yukti yaa kaushal kaa pradarshan he
 When a wave begins to break, it often forms a hollow stream as it descends under a rail mound or rock, which enables an experienced waveber to position itself in the hollow part of the wave
 Also called tube
 laharbaaz puri tarah se kai second ke liye pani se ghir saktaa he ; tab tak, jab tak ki lahar tub se baahar nikalne or lahar ke khule munh se waapas peeche jane ke liye baadhya na kare
 tub main sawari karte samay degree kii kathinaayee ke kaaran safai se tub ko paar nahin karke laharbaaz aksar sarfaboard se gir padate hai
 The definitive skill of tube riding can only be gained from years of experience riding hollow waves and it is also necessary to learn to predict how the waves will break, thus you will be able to stay longer inside the tube, or You will be able to get out before the waves break on you
 The world's best known waves for tube riding include the pipeline on the northern coast of Oahu, Tihupu in Tahiti and the g-land waves of Java
 hanging ten or hanging five aamtaur par laungbording vishisht chaal hai
 Hanging ten refers to hanging legs, with both feet on the front end of the board and the toe of the waggon at the end, also known as noserading

 Dev has the distinction of great poet under Brajbhasha poetry of Hindi
 unka puraa naam devdatt tha
 He was born in the Hindi language
 yadhyapi ye pratibha main bihari, bhushan, matiram aadi samakaleen kaviyon se kam nahin varan kuch badhkar hi siddh hote hai, phir bhi inkaa kisi ek vishisht rajdurbar se sambandh na hone ke kaaran inaki waisi khyaati or prasiddhi nahin hui
 Among the writers who have made Dev highly famous, Mishrabandhu is whose idea that Dev's place in Hindi literature comes after Tulsi
 dev or bihari main koun adhik shreshth he isko lekar ek vivaad bhi chalaa tha
 In this connection, the book 'dev and Bihari' was written by Pandit Krishnabihari Mishra and 'bihari and Dev' was written by Lala Bhagwadin
 in donon main dev or bihari kii kavypratibha ko spasht karne kaa praytn he
 Although six-seven poets named 'dev' are found under Hindi literature, other than the famous poet Dev, other poets named 'dev' did not get any special fame
 prasiddh dev kavi kaa janm san
 1730 main hua tha
 These Dyusaria Kanyakubj Dwivedi were Brahmins
 inkaa nivasasthaan itawa tha, jaisaa 'bhavvilas' kii nimnlikhit pankti se spasht hota he- His birth anniversary is also confirmed on the basis of 'bhavavilas', which he composed in Samvat 1746
 vah doha is prakaar he- Dev did his creations by staying at several shelters
 inaki rachana 'ashtyam' aurangzeb ke putr aajamshah ke sanket par hui thi or usne unhen puraskrit bhi kiya tha
 Perhaps 'bhavavilas' is also written in the shelter of Azam Shah
 dev ke duusare ashrayadata dadripati raja seetaram ke bhattije bhavanidutt vaisya the
 These Charkhi were residents of Dadri
 inke liye inhone 'bhavanivilas' naamak granth likhaa
 Dev's third refuge was Kushal Singh
 ye faphund ke rahanevaale the or dev ne inke liye 'kushalvilas' naamak granth kii rachana kii
 Dev's real qualities - customers and refugees were Raja Bhogilal, for whom he composed a book called 'rasavilas'
 inke sambandh main dev ne apane rasvilas main likhaa he- Dev's work 'premchandrika' is dedicated to Udyot Singh, son of Rao Mardansingh of Dyondia Khede
 'sujanvinod' kii rachana dilli ke rais pathiram ke putr sujanmani ke liye hui
 His final work 'sukhsagar Tarang' was written in the shelter of Ali Akbar Khan, the King of Pihani
 dev kii bahusankhyak rachanaaon kaa ullekh kiya jaataa he
 Some say the number of his texts is 72 and some people 52
 parantu inke pramanik granth, jo praapt hote hai, 18 hai
 The other nine texts are also mentioned by his name and thus a total of 27 texts match his name
 nirvivaad rup se jin 18 granthon ko devkrut sweekaar kiya ja saktaa he ve is prakaar hai- Handwritten texts are - devkrut ek sanskrit granth bhi 'shrangar vilasini' naam se bharatpur se prakashit hua tha
 Its theme is also Shringar and heroine, and Hindi verses have been composed in Sanskrit language in this book
 yadhyapi isaki rachana shuddh sanskrit main he, phir bhi dev kii vaastavik pratibha ke darshan isamen nahin hote
 To conclude from these majority texts of Dev that all texts are different from each other is misleading
 inke ek granth ke anek chand duusare granthon main milte hai or praaia: inhone apane kisi purvavarti granth ko ashrayadata kaa naam badalakar doosraa naam de diya he
 Most of Deva's narrative themes are love and adornment, but his perception of love and adornment is extremely high and his spirit is expressed in a sublime and bright form
 dev kaa kavyashastreey vivechan bhi, jo inke granthon main lakshan anshon main praapt hota he, apni moulik visheshta rakhata he
 But much of Dev's fame is contained in examples, not in his traits
 dev ke savaiya or ghanaakshari donon hi apni chhap rakhte hai or dev kii sundar rachanaaon ko kisi duusare kavi kii rachanaaon se milakar chipa rakhana sambhav na hoga
 The more extensive experience one gets in the compositions of Dev, the deeper the emotionality is also gained
 kisi bhi bhav kaa dev jaisaa sajiv or marmasparshi varnan asaadhaaran vastu he
 The imagination of God does not only possess an oratory characteristic, but he is fed with the feeling of sensation and gets plucked
 isi prakaar dev kii shabdaawalee bhi apni he
 The musical flowing vocabulary in Dev's vocabulary makes the verses effortlessly memorable and Dev has had unequaled success in portraying form, beauty, object, character
 dev apni inhen visheshtaon ke kaaran hindi sahitya main atyant utkrisht sthaan ke adhikari hue hai, yadhyapi samasamyik rajya sammaan inhen vaisaa praapt nahin hua tha jaisaa inhen milanaa chahie tha

 Ramcharit Manas is an epic written by 15th-century poet Goswami Tulsidas
 jaisaa tulsidas ne ramcharita maanas ke balkand main swayan likhaa he ki unhone ramcharita maanas kii rachana kaa armbh ayodhya main vikram samvath 1631 ko ramanavami ke din kiya tha
 According to Sri Hanuman Prasad Poddar of Gitapress Gorakhpur, Goswami Tulsidas ji took 2 years 7 months 26 days to write Ramcharitmanas and he completed it on the day of Ram Marriage in Margashirsha Shuklapaksha of Samvat 1633
 is mahakavy kii bhashaa avadhi he jo hindi kii hi ek shakha he
 In Ramcharitmanas, Goswami Tulsidas has described the serene and vivid character of Shri Ramchandra
 maharishi valmiki dwaara rachit sanskrit ramayana ko ramcharitamanas kaa aadhaar mana jaataa he
 Although both the Ramayana and the Ramcharitmanas describe the character of Rama, there is a significant difference in the description style of the poets who composed the epics
 jahaan valmiki ne ramayana main ram ko keval ek sansaarik vyakti ke rup main darshaya he vahiin tulsidas ne ramcharitamanas main ram ko bhagwaan vishnu kaa avatar mana he
 Tulsidas has divided Ramcharitmanas into seven scandal
 in saat kandon ke naam hai - balkand, ayodhyakand, aranyakand, kiskindhakand, sundarkand, lankacand or uttarkand
 According to the number of verses, Balkand and Kishkindhakanda are the largest and the smallest cases respectively

 As the above-mentioned quadrant shows, these people have come many times to say that whatever groom you want to ask, ask for it; But Manu Satarupa had to ask for Parambrahma himself as a son, then how could he ask for a boon from Shankar, Brahma and Vishnu? Our Lord Shri Ram is omniscient

 Animals have many special qualities that differentiate them from other living things
 jantu eukeriotic or bahu koshikeey hote hai,, jo unhen jeevanu va adhikansh protista se alag karte hai
 They are heterotrophic, usually digesting food in an inner chamber, which makes them distinct from plants and algae, they can also be differentiated from plants, algae and fungi because they lack a hard cell wall
 All animals are moving, even if they are in a particular phase of life
 adhiktam jantuon main, bhrun ek blastula avasthaa se hokar gujarata he, yah jantuon kaa ek vibhedak gun he
 With few exceptions, most notably sponges and placozoa, the bodies of animals differentiate into different tissues

 jin jantuon main is prakaar kaa sanghathan hota he, unhen metazon kaha jaataa he, yaa tab eumetazon kaha jaataa he jab, purv kaa prayog saamaanya rup se jantuon ke liye kiya jaataa he
 All animals have eukaryotic cells, which are surrounded by extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoprotein
 yah khol, asthi or kantak jaisi sanranchanaaon ke nirmaan ke liye kelsikrut ho sakati hai
 During development, it forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move and reorganize, creating possible complex structures
 iske vipareet, anya bahukoshikeey jeev jaise paudhe or kavak kii koshikaayen koshika bhitti se ghiri hoti hai or is prakaar se pragatisheel vruddhi dwaara viksit hoti hai
 In addition, animal cells have a unique property of intercellular joints: tight junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes
 lagbhag sabhi jantu kisi prakaar ke langik prajnan kii prakriya se hokar guzarate hai: poliploid
 These have some specialized reproductive cells that undergo meiosis to produce small motile spermatozoa or large sedentary eggs
 ye sangalit hokar yugmanaj banaate hai, jo viksit hokar nayaa jeev banaata he
 Many animals also have asexual reproductive capacity
 yah anishekajanan ke dwaara ho saktaa he, jahaan bina nishechan ke anda bhrun main viksit ho jaataa he, kuch maamalon main vikhandeekaran ke dwaara bhi aisa sambhav he
 The zygote initially develops into a hollow sphere called blastula, it undergoes a process of rearrangement and differentiation of cells
 spanj main, blastula larva tair kar ek nae sthaan par chalaa jaataa he or ek nae spanj main viksit ho jaataa he
 In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complex rearrangements

 The selective pressure exerted on one another has led to an evolutionary race between prey and predator, resulting in many anti-predator adaptations
 zyaadaatar jantu apratyaksh rup se surya ke prakaash se hi urja praapt karte hai
 Plants use this energy to convert sunlight into simple sugars using a process called photosynthesis
 prakaash sanshleshan kii prakriya carbon dioxide or jal ke saath shuru hoti he, isamen surya ke prakaash kii urja ko rasinic urja main badal diya jaataa he, jo glucose ke bandhon main sanchit ho jaati he, is prakriya ke dauraan oxigen bhi mukt hoti he
 Now this sugars are used as manufacturing units, which leads to plant growth

 It either aids in the direct development of the animal or decomposes and is stored solar energy and thus the animal receives the energy required for movement
 yah prakriya glycolysis ke naam se jaani jaati he Animals that live close to water heat exhausts or cold seeps on the ocean floor are not dependent on the energy of the sun

 Although some archaeologists and geologists suggest that animals appeared much earlier than previously thought, probably 1 billion years ago
 Fossil insignia such as trails and burrows found in the Tonian era indicate the presence of three-dimensional worms such as metazoa

 The sponges are stems and usually draw water through their pores to obtain food
 aarkiokaitha, jisamen sangalit kankal hota he, vah spanj kaa yaa ek alag sangh kaa pratinidhitiv kar saktaa he
 However, a Fellow genomic study of 150 genes in 21 species in 2008 suggests that it is Tinophora or comb jelly that forms the basis of animals in at least 21 of those associations
 lekhak vishwaas rakhte hai ki spanj yaa kam se kam ve spanj jo unhone khoje hai- itane aadim nahin hai, lekin iske bajaay dwitiyak rup se sarlikrut kiye ja sakate hai
 In other phyla, Tinophora and Nideria, including sea anemones, corals, and jellyfish, are radially symmetric, having a digestive chamber with a single pore, which serves both the mouth and the anus
 donon main spasht vibhedit utak hote hai, lekin ye angon main sangathit nahin hote hai
 There are only two main germ levels, ectoderm and endoderm, between which only the cells are scattered
 isi liye in jantuon ko kabhi kabhi diploblactic kaha jaataa he
 Small placozoa are similar, but do not have a permanent digestive chamber
 shesh jantu ek sangheey samooh banaate hai jo bailetria kehalaata he
 For the maximum part, they are bilateral symmetric and often have a specialized head consisting of food organs and sensory organs
 sharir tripaloblastic hota he, arthath, teenon janan paraten purna viksit hoti hai or utak vibhedit ang banaate hai
 The digestive chamber has two holes, a mouth and an anus, as well as an internal body cavity which is also called a celome or virtual body cavity
 in main prayek lakshan ke apwaad hai, haalaanki- vyask ekainodermet trigyat samamit hota he or vishisht paraseete jantuon main bahut hi sarlikrut shaareerik saranchana hoti he
 Genetic studies have changed our knowledge of relationships within the Bilateria to a great extent
 adhikansh do mukhya vanshawaliyon se sambandh rakhte hai: duterostome or protostome, jinamein shaamil hai ekadsojoa, platizoa or lophotrocojoa
 In addition to this, there are some small groups of bipartite asymmetrical organisms that appear to be diffusing to these main groups
 in main shaamil hai esolmorpha, rombojoa or orthonekatida
 Mixozoa, a unicellular parasite originally thought to be protozoan, are thought to have evolved from the Bilateria
 duterostome anya bailetria, protostome se kai prakaar se bhinn hai
 In both cases a complete digestive tract is found
 haalanki, protostome main praarambhik chhidr muh main viksit hota he or guda alag se viksit hoti he
 This is the reverse in deuterostomes
 adhikansh protostome main, koshikaayen saadhaaran rup se gestrula ke aantarik bhaag main bhar jaati hai or madhya janan str banaati hai, yah shaijosilas vikaas kehalaata he, lekin duterostome main yah antar janan str ke antervalan se banataa he, jise entrocelic pouching kaha jaataa he
 Deuterostomes have a dorsal nerve cord rather than a ventral and their embryos undergo a different cleavage
