 The degeneration of erstwhile French society was also an important factor in the origins of the French Revolution

 The autocracy of the monarchy came to an end and people breathed peace in the democratic atmosphere
 is samay hamaare saamne yah prashan uthta he ki 1789 i
 main kranti kaa sutrapat anya europe deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi kyon hui
 a study of European nations of the 18th century showed that the condition of France at that time was worse than that of other Europe nations
 nirankush rajtantr suvidha yukt varg or karon ke asaahneey bhaar se dabaa hua tha
 Ordinary classes were present in almost all European countries
 kuch rajyon kii sthiti to france se bhi adhik vikrut thi prasha, austria or rus aadi france se bhi adhik vikrut the
 French farmers were happier than other European nations
 saadhaaran varg kii sthiti anya europe rajyon main or bhi kharaab thi
 Nevertheless, the revolution took place not in these countries but in France first
 iskaa pramukh kaaran yah tha kii france log apni sthiti ke prati jaagruk the
 It is not a necessary condition for revolution that its explosion takes place in the same countries where people are victims of atrocities, incest and exploitation
 samrudh or unnat desh main bhi kranti ho sakati he
 Provided that its residents feel that injustice is being done to them
 france kii janata is anyaay ko mahasus kar rahi thi
 Wanted to get away from it
 vahaan aise anek darshanik or lekhak paidaa hue jinhone apni lekhnee ke dwaara in kashton kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrishti karaayaa anya europee deshon kii badtar sthiti ke baavjud france main sarvapratham lui solvaan ke khilaaf kranti hui
 There were many reasons for this revolution which are as follows
 frasisi saamanton kaa badla hua swarup or kisaano kii unnat avasthaa- Such was the reason for the advanced state of French peasants and the changed nature of feudalism
 jiske chalate france main sarv pratham rajyakranti hui
 Farmers in the European country were still in a state of gloom
 parantu france ke kisaan swatantra ho chuke the
 They did not own their own land and own their own land in spite of such convenience and feudal services, they had to pay a large part of their income in the form of feudal tax
 or phir bhi uski sthiti acchhee dhi
 They used to buy some land by saving money and the hunger to buy land was constantly increasing, there was a problem of feudalism and unemployment, so they were thinking of removing the feudal occupations, so they got strength under the leadership of the middle class
 And in 1789 AD they revolted
 france main udaar nirankushta kii parampara kaa abhaav- Other European countries also had autocratic monarchies
 parantu vahaan ke samraaton ne samaynusaar apni nirankushta main kami kar di thi
 King Fredirak of Prasha was the great enlightened administrator of his time
 jiskaa anusaran europe ke anya desh rus germany, italy, spain aadi ne kiya
 In due course of time, he tried as much as possible to improve the economic, physical and other fields
 parantu france main is tarah ki udaar nirankushta kaa abhaav tha
 The kings there were doing nothing for the benefit of the people
 balki adhik tex vasulanaa or janata kaa shoshan karnaa unki niti ban gai thi
 Therefore, the French people were fed up with it, so the people of France wanted to end the autocratic monarchy
 maadyam varg kii jaagarukta- The reason for the first revolution in France was the middle class there
 anya deshon main bhi madhyam varg thi parantu ve france kii tarah saanskriti, dhani evam shikshit nahin the
 He lacked strength
 ve raja ke khilaaf baghawat karne kii soch nahin sakate the
 The middle class people in France were dissatisfied with their emperors for many reasons
 or apni raksha ke liye raaj satta par ankush lagane ke liye utawala ho rahe the
 Other European states lacked this type of situation
 anya deshon main netritv karne vaala koi nahin tha france main jaagruk madhyamvarg taiyaar tha
 Therefore, revolution first took place in France itself
 kulinvarg kii anupayogita- The elite Vigyan was given the first privilege to help the king in running the rule
 or ve janaata kii raksha bhi karte the
 But slowly - 2 started doing this work for the king's employees
 falat: kulinon kii upyogita samaapt ho gai
 Yet there was no cut in its prerogative
 isliye kisaan or madhyam varg ke log kulinvarg se ghrinaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries
 vahaan abhi bhi kulinon ki payogita bani hui thi
 The influence of philosophers 18 veen shatabdi main sampoorn europe main boudik halchal machi hui thi
 Philosophers, thinkers, scientists were present in all countries
 parantu unamem mukhya france ke vichaarak the
 Who presented the psychological basis of the revolution
 unhone samaaj main vaypt buraaiyon kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrisht karaayaa or muk janata ko vaani di
 Such an attempt was not being made in other countries
 montegu, waltare ruso aadi vichaarkon kaa kaary kshetra france hi tha
 Austria, Prasha and Russia did not have such thinkers
 europe ke anya deshon main logon kaa unki vaastavik sthiti bataane vaala or unamem santosh paidaa karne vaala darshanikon kaa koi varg nahin tha
 This was a major reason for revolution in France itself
 raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaa abhaav- When the middle class became aware in England, they were given the opportunity to participate in the politics of the country
 parantu france ke saath aisi baat nahin thi
 The middle class of France was quite dissatisfied with its emperors
 unki apeksha kii jaati thi
 Despite being educated, they did not have a reputation like the nobles
 unhen france kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar nahin diya jaataa tha
 Therefore, he dissented and raised the slogan of revolution
 ayogy raja tathaa prashasan main bhrashtachar- The political system of France was centralized but the kings were inept
 prashasan main bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha
 In other countries of Europe, autocratic rule was broken but kings were eligible and they had full control over governance
 france kaa madhyam varg is prashasnic bhrashtatar ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 And so he was ready to revolt
 rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai- At this time, national sentiment began to rise rapidly in Europe
 sampoorn europe main france hi ek aisa desh tha jahaan ek raashtra bhaavana kaa purnat: abhaav tha
 Due to this, there was a revolution in France for the first time
 america swatantraaa sangram kaa prabhaav- The American War of Independence started in 1766 AD
 gimen america ke logon ne england ke khilaaf vidroh kar kar diya
 The soldiers of France also got an opportunity to participate in this freedom struggle, so they felt that freedom can be achieved through war
 unhone yah bhi anubhav kiya ki swatantraaa so hi sukh kii prapti sambhav he
 On returning to France, he saw that the freedom he fought for in America is the complete lack of freedom in France
 at: ve yahan kii kranti ke liye baichaiyn ho uthe or yuddh ke dwaara swatantraaa praapt karne kii cheshtaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries of Europe
 francisi sabhyataa kii shreshthata- a specific reason for the revolution in France itself was that the civilization and culture of other Europe was more prosperous and rich than other European nations
 shashan vyavastha kii drushti se bhi france kaa shashan atyadhik suvyavasthit tha
 France is considered a symbol of civilization and culture throughout Europe
 sampoorn europe main paris sahitya or chintan kaa sabase bada kendra mana jaataa he
 The France public opinion was more aroused and critical than other European states

 " unhone yah bhi kaha ki gandhi koi amar vyakti nahin hai
 How many such people were born in India and went away
 ambedkar ne kaha ki gandhi kii jaan bachaane ke liye vah daliton ke hiton kaa tyaag nahin kar sakate

 The Directive Principles of State Policy are the latest elements of democratic constitutional development
 sarvapratham ye ireland ke samvidhan me lagu kiye gayi the
 These are the elements which have developed with the development of the Constitution
 in tatwon kaa kaary ek janakalyankari rajya kii sthapana karnaa he
 The Directive Principles of State Policy have been incorporated from Articles 36 to 51 of the Constitution of India

 According to Article 37, these elements cannot be applied in any court, these elements are not legal and have political form and only have moral rights
 ve na to koi vaidhanik baadhyataa hi rajya pe lagu karte he na janata hetu adhikaar kartavya
 They are just such general instructions for the state that the state should do such things which will be beneficial for the people of the state
 in nirdeshon kaa paalan karypalika kii niti tathaa vidhayika kii vidhiyaan se ho saktaa he
 In 1951, the Supreme Court ruled that the elements were essentially subordinate to the fundamental rights
 Chamar Durai Rajan suit would not give priority to fundamental rights in case of a dispute, but when the state legislature started the abolition of zamindari
 In order to give effect to the Directive Principles of Article 39B, the Supreme Court recognized the importance of these elements and in Kameshwar Singh Vs
 From 1952 till 1957, the Supreme Court accepted that the Directive Principles of Policy cannot prevail on Fundamental Rights, but later the Court laid down the Harmony Principle and tried for collaborative development and tried to make both of them more effective
 As much as was possible
 hormoni siddhant dono ke madhya koi sangharsh nahi maan kar dono ko ek duusare kaa poorak maanata he
 According to this theory, if two interpretations are possible that balance the Directive Principles with the Fundamental Right, the second interpretation should be disputed in them, then the court should give priority to the first interpretation over the second interpretation if only one interpretation is possible and which policy - If there is a conflict between the rights, then the court is bound to abolish the 'privy purse' and give priority to the rights over the policy directors
 The Nationalization Act, which was brought for the compliance of Article 39 'B' and 'S', was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court for violation of fundamental rights, Parliament passed the 25th Amendment 1971 in response to this and Article 31 Gave birth to s which states that if a law is passed which gives effect to the Directive Principles of 39 b and in this process if paragraph 14, 19, anu 31 sa ke anusaar koi vidhi jo anu 39 ba sa ko prabhavi karti he kisi bhi nyaayalay me parakshit nahi kii ja sakegi
 This amendment was challenged in the Keshavanand Bharti suit

 This amendment was challenged in Minerva Mill vs Union of India suit in 1980, in which the Supreme Court declared the new amendment to Article 31 non-constitutional as it distorted the balance of parts 3 and 4 of the Constitution

 The induction motor is a alternating current motor whose angular speed of the rotor is less than the angular speed of the rotational magnetic field produced by the stator winding
 isi kaaran is motor ko 'atulykaalik motor' kaha jaataa he 
 This is called the 'induction motor' because the current is generated by induction in its rotor because the speed of the rotor and rotational magnetic field are different
 yah motor sabase adhik upyog main aata he jiske kaaran ise udyogon kaa workehorse kehete hai
 There is no wear-resistant component so that it can last for many days without repair
 yah kai prakaar kaa hota he- Most motors used in homes for general tasks and low power are single-phase induction motors, also known as fractional horsepower motors
 udhaaharan ke liye pankhons, dhulaai kii mashiinon ke motor aadi
 Reverse current motors also have field coils and armatures similar to direct current motors, but in some different form
 inamen do mukhya bhaag hote hai : ek to stater, jo sthir rahata he or doosraa roter jo ghumta he
 Reverse current motors are also of different types
 sabase-saamaanya prayavarti dhara motor preran motor he, jo preran ke siddhant par kaary karata he
 In induction motors, the stator coiling is associated with the triplet capacitance, causing a rotational magnetic field
 roter ke chaalak aapas main trikleey kundalan ke rup main bhi ho sakate hai, jo donon siron par taanbe ke valay dwaara laghu paripathit hon
 Such a composition is, in effect, like a squirrel's cage
 at: aise motaron ko saamanyat: 'gilahari panjar preran motor', athwa keval 'panjar motor' hi kehete hai
 These motors are very strong in design as well as are simple and cheap
 inaki dakshata bhi usee aakaar ke duusare motaron kii apeksha unchi hoti he
 Hence the use of these motors is often universal
 parantu in motaron kaa prachaalan, ek prakaar se, roter kii banaavat se anusaar nishchit hota he or usamen aavashyaktaa ke anusaar parivartan nahin kiya ja saktaa
 Their initial force is very low, which is necessary to insert some resistance in the rotor circuit to improve, but this is not possible due to the formation of stable type
 saath hi sthaayee taur par roter chaalkon kaa pratirodh bhi adhik nahin kiya ja saktaa, kyonki aisa karne par haani adhik bad jaaegi or motor kii dakshata ghat jaaegi
 In order to achieve more initial, forced bipeder motors are used, which have two toes instead of one

 The synchronous speed ns { \ displaystyle n_ {s}} of an AC motor is the speed of the rotational magnetic field of its stator
 iskaa maan nimnlikhit sutara se nikaala ja saktaa he- Where f { \ displaystyle f} is the frequency of supply of the motor and p { \ displaystyle p} is the number of magnetic poles, for example, 50 Hz supply and, for a 6-pole three-phase motor, p { \ displaystyle p} = 6 and ns { \ displaystyle n_ {s}} = 1,000 RPM slip s { \ displaystyle s} ko praayah nimnlikhit prakaar se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he- Where ns { \ displaystyle n_ {s}} synchronous speed, nr { \ displaystyle n_ {r}} the rotor speed if the rotor is moving at synchronous speed, the value of slip will be zero if the rotor is not moving at all
 The value will be 1
 motor dwaara utpann balaghurna kaa maan uske roter kii slip par nirbhar karata he
 Which is called 'slip-torque specification'
 spasht he ki preran motor 'lagbhag' sthir chaal par chalate hai
 Their gait variance is very less with weight
 at:, jin bhaaron ke liye sthir chaal kii aavashyaktaa hoti he, vahaan ve bahut upyogi hote hai
 However, motor motors are not commonly used where variable speed is required
 inaki chaal tulykaalik chaal se kuch hi kam hoti he, jo dhruv sankhya tathaa aavriti par nirbhar karti he
 Therefore, to move around, it is necessary to either change the pole number, or to vary the frequency
 aavriti vicharan karne kaa taatpary he ki alag aise sambharan kii vyavastha karnaa jisaki aavriti badali ja sake
 Nowadays variable frequency drives are coming for this
 dhruv sankhya ko ek vishisht anupaat main, kundalan ke sambandhan main parivartan karke badla ja saktaa he, jaise ek 4 dhruvi motor ko 8 dhruvi athwa 6 dhruvi motor main parivartit karnaa sambhav he
 Thus the velocities corresponding to these pole numbers can also be obtained
 50 chakree aavriti par 4 dhruvi motor kii tulykaalik chaal 1,500 RPM or 6 dhruvi tathaa 8 dhruvi kaa kramash: 1,000 tathaa 750 RPM he
 In this way, by changing the pole number of such motor, its speed can be obtained
 par ye keval do yaa teen kramon main hi ho sakate hai
 By this method it is not possible to get the variance in a wide range
 kuch nishchit kramon main chaal vicharan kii ek duusari vidhi "sopanipat niyantran" kehalaati he
 This method is mostly used in rolling mills

 Sixth century BC of different languages with many characteristics of the above types of Sanskrit
 Can it be possible to generate in the same way? Apart from this, many such words are found in Prakrit which are lacking in Sanskrit, but they are present in Vedic language
 praakrit kii anek pravritiyon ko liye hue bahut se shabd vedon main paae jate hai, jo sanskrit vyakaran ke anukool nahin hai
 One of the views of many Western scholars on this problem is that when the Aryabhasha became prevalent in Bharatvarsha, the non-aryans could not pronounce and use it as pure as the Aryans; Therefore, according to his personal pronunciation and language style, he started speaking it and his contact also affected Aryo
 isi ke falswaroop praakrit bhashaa kii pravritiyon kaa vikaas hua
 In support of this view, it is also worth noting that since the Vedic period, the idols, etc
, which entered the Aryan language, were largely influenced by the non-aryan languages of that period
 kintu pracheen anarya bhashaaon kaa vishleshan kar yah siddh nahin kiya ja saktaa ki praakrit kii ukt visheshtaon kaa beej un anarya bhashaaon main vidyaman the
 That is why there is a dispute regarding this opinion
 doosraa mat yah he ki vedon kii bhashaa bolanewaale jatiyon main hi swayan dhvanyatmak bhed the, jinke kuch pramaan vedon main hi upasthit he anumaanath: vedon kii bhashaa us kaal kii roodhibaddh vedbhaasha ke kramvik se anumaanath: kai hajaar varsho main sanskrit bhashaa kaa vikaas hua, par visheshat: sushikshit purohit varg kii apni bhashaa thi, tathaa jisamen dharmik kaaryon me hi upyog kiya jaataa tha
 At the same time, Sanskrit as well as Prakrit developed from the lingua franca of the contemporary people of the oldest Vedic language, in which there were many differences according to the region
 is sambandh main yah bhi baat dhyaan dene yogya he ki bharat main aaryon kaa pravesh ek hi kaal main evam ek dhara main hua nahin kaha ja saktaa
 It is not surprising if the origin and development of Prakrit languages is related to the language discrimination of the Aryan castes coming back and forth

 Idh used in Pali is of pre-sanskrit and Vedic tradition, no one has any doubt about it

 In reality, considering Sanskrit or Vedic as the nature of Prakrit, there is no solution to the above symptoms
 tab praakrit ke vaiyakarnon ne sanskrit ko praakrit kii prakruti kyon kaha? iskaa kaaran un vyakaranon ke rache jane ke kaal or unke swaroop par dhyaan dene se spashtat: samaj me aa jaataa he
 Those grammars were written at a time when Sanskrit had more publicity and respect than Prakrit in scholasticism
 ve likhe bhi sanskrit bhashaa main gaye hai tathaa unka uddeshy bhi sanskrit naatakon main bhi prakritikta rakhane ke liye karnaa padataa tha or jinamein utkrisht saahitiyik rachanaayen bhi nirmit ho chuki thim
 Therefore, those grammars, by making Sanskrit ideal, gave a description of the characteristics which were in Prakrit and proved its significance by calling Sanskrit the nature of Prakrit
 tathaapi namisadhu ne apana yah mat spasht prakat kiya he ki prakruti kaa arth lok yaa janata he or jansadharan ko bhashaa hone se hi vah praakrit kahalaai
 The meaning of nature is very ancient and Kalidas has also used it in the meaning of folk

 And in his literary works, Sanskrit has a big influence in terms of words and style
 bhashaa jab tak boli ke rup main rahati he, usamen desh or kaal kii apeksha nirantar parivartan hote rahete hai
 According to this rule, three levels of Prakrit have been accepted relative to time - shraman mahavir or buddha ne jis bhashaa yaa bhashaaon main apane upadesh die ve praakrit ke pracheen str ke utkrisht rup rahe honge
 The language of his teachings has been called Magadhi and Ardhamagadhi respectively
 kintu vartmaan main pali kahi janevaali bhashaa ke granthon main hame magadhi kaa vah swaroop nahin miltaa jaisaa pashchaatkaaleen vaiyakarnon ne batalaaya he
 However, the form of the language found in Buddhist Tripitaka texts is accepted only in the ancient level of Prakrit

 These 14 testimonials reveal the ancient form of Shaurseni to that language
 uttar pradeshwarti kaalsi, jogad nachauli naamak sthanon par bhi ve hi 14 prashastiyaan utkeern hai
 In this we get an inflection of a word in place of 'L' and the subject factor of non-intransitive nouns

 Thus, there are no three characteristics of Magadhi Prakrit here
 atev ise magadhi kii apeksha ardhamagadhi praakrit ke teen lakshanon main se do prachur rup se praapt hote hai, kintu sakaar sambandhi teesraa lakshan nahin
 Therefore, it seems more appropriate to call it the ancient form of Ardmagadhi Prakrit than Magadhi

 iske pashchaat praakrit bhashaaon ke jo bhed prabhed hue unka vishad varnan bharat naatyashaastra main praapt hota he
 He considered two types of recitation - Sanskrit and Prakrit; And it is said that three types of words are prevalent in Prakrit - same, different and native
 naatak main bhashaprayog kaa vivaran unhone is prakaar diya he - uttam paatr sanskrit bolen, kintu yadi ve daridr ho jaaen to praakrit bolen; shraman, tapasvi bhikshu, stri, balak, aadi ashuddh he
 However, it is so clear that he ordered the omissions of k, t, d, y and v in place of omissions, b, d etc
 Tk d, the fuzzy the car accent of Eternal; It is noted that the changes in the nature of Ksh, Krishna etc
 isse pramanit he ki ve dwitiya str kii praakrit kaa hi varnan kar rahe hai
 In the 32nd chapter, he has described in detail the Gitikavya called Dhruva with examples and has clearly stated that only Shaurseni should be used in Dhruva
 yah baat unke udaahranon se bhi pramanit he
 Therefore, the postwar notion is that Maharashtra should be used in the lyrical part of plays
 bharat ke mat se naatak main shauraseni bhashaa kaa prayog kiya jaay yaa icchaanusaar kisi bhi deshbhasha kaa
 There are seven such official languages - Magadhi, Avanti, Shaurseni, Ardhamagadhi, Wahlika and Dakshinatya
 ant:poor nivaasiyon ke liye magadhi; chet, raajputr or sethon ke liye arghamagadhi; vidushakaadi ke liye praacha; nayika evam sakhiyon ke liye ardhamagaghi; vidushakaadi ke liye praacha; nayika evam sakhiyon ke liye shauraseni se aviruddh aavanti; yoddha, naagarik tathaa juaariyon ke liye dakshinatya; tathaa udichy, khas, shabar, shaq aadi jatiyon ke liye vahlika kaa prayog karen
 Apart from these, Bharat has called the inferior languages of Shabar, Aabhira, Chandal etc
 as Vibsha
 is prakaar bharat ke naatak ke paatro main jo praakrit bhaawanaaon kaa bantwaaraa kiya he uskaa sanskrit ke naatakon main aanshik rup se hi paalan kiya jaataa he
 In Sanskrit plays, Prakrit is the most used and the Vichitra is found in the Mudrachikatikam of Shudraka
 pishal, kith vidwaanon aadi ke matanusaar to mrichctic kii rachana kaa uddeshy hi praakrit sambandhi naatyashaastra ke niyamon ko udaahrit karnaa prathit hota he
 According to the commentator Prithivadhar of this play, only four types of Prakrit are used in the play - Shaurseni, Avantika, Oriental and Magadhi
 prastut naatak main sutaradhar, nati, nayika vasantsena, charudatt kii brahmani stri evam shreshthi tathaa inke parichaarak paricharikaai aise 11 paatr shauraseni bolte hai
 There are only two secondary characters who speak the Avanti language
 praachya bhashaa keval vidooshak bolta he; tab kunj, chetak, bhikshu or charudatt kaa putr kul chah paatr magadhi bolte hai inke atirikt shakari, chandali tathaa dhakki ke bhi bolanewaale ek ek do do paatr hai
 But if the language of all these characters is analyzed, they can all be divided into two parts - Shaurseni and Maggi
 tikaakar ne swayan kaha he ki aavanti main keval rakaar va lokoktiyon kaa bahulya hota he or praacha main swaarthik kakar kaa
 In other things, he is only a brave
 shakari, chandali tathaa dhakki sab magadhi kii hi sheliyaan he
 In this way, despite the natural abundance of Namchar, there is virtually no language difference in Mritchkatik compared to Ashwaghosh's plays
 praakrit kaa swaroop kalgati se vishesh viksit ho gaya he or usamen kuch aise lakshan aa gaye hai jinke kaaran is praakrit ko pracheen str kii apeksha dwitiya str kii kaha jaataa he
 We find a description of Prakrit and his country differences at the same level in the available Prakrit grammars and his rich literature also exists
 dwitiya str kii praakrit kaa sarvapracheen vyakaran chandkrit praakrit lakshan yaa aarsh praakrit vyakaran he
 It is very brief and only 99 sutras represent Prakrit's methods
 is str kii visheshta batalaane vaale sutara dhyaan dene yogya hai
 According to Sutra 76, in the place of the first stanzas etc
 of the classes, there is a third order, viz
, Vampachi-bisaji, jata-data, krita-kadana, pratisiddha-padisiddh
 sutara 77 ke anusaar kh gh ch or bha ke sthaan main hakaar kaa aadesh jaise- mukhan -- muhan, megh: -- neho, madhav: -- maahvo, vrishabh: -- vasaho
 According to Sutra 97, the third letter of k and classes is omitted beyond the vowel, such as - Kokil: - Kohli, Bhagik: - Bhoio, Raja - Raya, Nadi - Nai
 sutara 98 ke anusaar lupt vyanjan ke pare a hone par ya hota he, jaise - kakau kaayau, nanaau naaya, rajau raaya
 The last 99th sutra states that the rest of Prakrit's system should be known through polite experiments
 inase aage ke chaar sutron main apbhransh kaa lakshan, sanyukt varna se lakaar kaa lop na hona, peshachi kaa r or n ke sthaan par l or na kaa aadesh, magadhika kaa r or s ke sthaan par l or sh kaa aadesh, tathaa shauraseni kaa t ke sthaan main vikalp se d kaa aadesh batalaaya gaya he
 Linguists are of the opinion that instead of the unacceptable characters of the second level, the beginning of the darker letters began to be pronounced
 phir inaki alpatar dhwani shesh rahi or phir sarvatha lop ho gaya, tathaa mahapraan dhvaniyon ke sthaan par keval ek shuddh ooshm dhwani h avshisht rah gai
 These trends and all the Jain Prakrit are from the Yr Shruti option specified in the said Aasha grammar
 kintu pashchaatkaaleen 16veen, 17veen shatee ke praakrit vaiyakarnon ne prakriton ke nirupan main jo bhrantiyaan utpann kii hai, unke aadhaar par kuch paashchaatya vidwaanon ne jain sahitya kii prakriton ko ukt vikalpon ke sadbhaav ke kaaran jain shauraseni tathaa jain maharashtri naamon dwaara pruthak nirdisht karnaa aavashyak samajha, yah aitihaasik drushti se vaastavik nahin he
 After this Arsha Prakrit grammar, a grammar called Prakritprakash was written, which was further increased twice
 aadi ke nau pariched vararuchi krit hai
 In these, the Prakrit method, the consonant method, the conjunctive method, the narrow, the cognate, the pronoun method, the form, the object and the imputation are represented respectively
 ant main kaha gaya he ki praakrit kaa shesh swaroop sanskrit ke samajhnaa chahie
 In this grammar, the nature of the second level Prakrit is found to be completely determined
 iske anusaar madhyavarti k g ch j t d p ya or da kaa praaia: lop hota he, evam kh gh th dh or bh ke sthaan par h aadesh
 Katyayan, Bhamah, Vasantraj, Sadanand and Rampanism are the commentaries on this ancient division of Prakrit Prakash
 aage ke 10wein or 12wein parichchhedon main kramash: pashachi kaa 14 sutron main tathaa magadhi kaa 17 sutron main nirupan kiya gaya he
 The nature of these two languages is called Shaurseni
 kintu isse purv kahin bhi shaureseni kaa naam nahin aayaa
 Therefore, presumably in the view of its doers, the representation of common nature is that of the well-known shoraseni of that period
 in do parichchhedon par keval bhamah kii tikaa he or vidwaanon kaa anumaan he ki ye donon pariched unheen ke jode hue hai
 In these, the feature of Paishachi is the order of the first and second place in the middle of the word, in the middle of the third and fourth characters, in place of n, j, in place of nya, and in place of tva and in the place of Magadhi, s In place of Ksh or k in place, Hke, Hage and Ahke in place of an ego in place of K, and the causative factor is said to be at the end of the singular
 praakrit prakaash kaa antim 12 vaan pariched bahut peeche joda gaya prathit hota he
 There is no vaccine of Bhamha and others on this
 is pariched kii avasthaa badi vilakshan he
 In it, the symptoms of Shaurseni have been told, in which the nature is said to be Sanskrit
 kintu antim 32wein sutara main pun: kaha gaya haihri sheshan maharashtri vat
 But before that the word Maharashtri has not appeared in the grammar or elsewhere in the grammar
 jaan padataa he yah pariched us samay joda gaya he jab yah dharna sudrudh ho gai ki praakrit kavy kii bhashaa maharashtri hi honi chahie
 Therefore, where Prakrit is instructed, Maharashtri should be taken for granted
 yahan jo shauraseni kaa swaroop batalaaya gaya he, usee se spasht ho jaataa he ki jo swaroop yahan saamaanya praakrit kaa batalaaya gaya he, vah shauraseni kaa hi kalanusaar viksit rup he
 For example, in Shaurseni, the place of intermediate t and TH are d and d respectively, in Prakrit there is the omission of d and th
 "bh" dhaatu kaa shauraseni main "bho" hi rahata he, ki kintu praakrit main vahaan "ho" aadesh kaha gaya he
 In Shaurseni there is a gem in the form of the impotent plural, like Jalani, Vani, there only remains of Prakrit, as in Jalaine, Vaniya Shaurseni there is the Dola, Dandi and Dana, etc
, while in Prakrit it is d
 Goes, like Dola, Stalk and Dasan etc
 prakritprakash ke pashchaat praakrit tathaa uski pradeshik bhashaaon kaa sarvangpurn nirupan karanevaala, praakrit vyakaran hemchandra dwaara 12veen shatee i
 main likhaa gaya
 It has four passages, out of which about three and a half passages give a systematic description of Prakrit and the remaining about 200 sutras have given special features of Shaurseni, Magadhi, Paisachi, Chulika Paisachi and Apabhramsa languages respectively
 in bhashaaon main se pratham teen kaa swaroop to adhik vistrut rup me vahi he jo upar batalaaya ja chukaa he
 Characteristics of Chulika Paishachi It is stated here in the four sutras that instead of the third and fourth letters, the order of the first and second is there, the word is from the option, some acharyas do not change the sound of the initials, The remaining things should be known like a vampiric

 a radio receiver is an electrical circuit that presents the signals available in the form of electromagnetic waves after the antennas have finally processed them into sound or some other useful form
 radio tarangon ke utpaadan evam unke gunon ke adhyayan kaa prayaas sarvapratham hikerikh hertz ne san 1887 main kiya tha
 In his history famous experiment, the waves generated by the arrangement of the production of radio waves, he himself received in the form of sphincters between two knobs which were located at both ends of a string of wires
 harts ke is praarambhik prayog ne radio tarangon kii grahan vidhaon kii sambhaavna ke sanket die the, jinke aadhaar par kaary karte hue oliver loj ne san 1894 main england main ek vishesh prakaar ke sansuchak kaa nirmaan kiya, jo radio tarangon ko shravy aavriti kii tarangon main parivartit kar saktaa tha
 This detector was actually a glass tube filled with metal-rattan
 is sansuchak ko ek antena tathaa ek samaswarit paripath se sanyut kar pratham radio sangrahi kaa nirmaan kiya gaya tha
 In this way, Oliver Lodge is responsible for envisaging the organizational component of the wireless communication system and presenting its first useful form
 loj ne apni is vishesh vyavastha dwaara pratham radio sangrahi kaa nirmaan safaltaapurvak kar use patent karaayaa
 Encouraged by the success of the lodge, many scientists created new detectors
 inamen goolyelmo marconi ne chumbakeey prakaar ke sansuchakon kii, vriland tathaa fesnden ne vidyut vishleshya prakaar ke tathaa lee di foresti ne sakriy vidyudvishleshya prakaar ke sansuchakon kii rachana kii
 Several crystal detectors were also made in this sequence, in which crystals of Carborundum, Galena, Iron Pyrites etc
 were used

 e
 fleming ne dwidhruvi valbon kaa nirmaan kar, radio sanchaar pranali ke vikaas ke itihaas main nae adhyay kaa sutarapaat kiya
 The use of these valves as a detector solved many difficulties and problems
 isi ke lagbhag ek varsh ke hi ananthar lee di forest ne tryod valve kaa pranayan kar, electronic tathaa radio sanchaar pranali ke kshetra main kranti kaa aavirbhaav kar diya
 These valves and their many modified forms such as tetrod and pentode, etc
 can be credited with bringing the radio communication system to the modern form
 pravardhakon, sansuchakon evam samaswarit paripathon kii sanrachana karanevaale compitron kii rachana inhen vaalvon kii sahaayta se kii jaati he
 The part of the radio communication system that dissociates the desired fraction from the radio frequency energy that continuously transmits to the aerial is called the radio satellite
 sabhi prakaar ke radio sangraahiyon ko mulat: nimnlikhit kaary karne padate hai : a variety of radio signals continue to reach the antennas, which are transmitted from the transmission centers located in different parts of the world
 sangrahi main is baat kii upyukt vyavastha honi chahie ki vah kisi bhi kshan kisi vaanchit sanket vishesh kaa varan kar, use anya sanketon se pruthak kar, grahan kar sake
 For the accomplishment of this purpose, many motivations and capacitors are included in the selection system of the collector
 inamen se ekaadhik parivartaneey, yaa char bhi hote hai
 The combination of these inductors and capacitors creates a synchronized circuit
 is paripath main prerakatvon evam sandharitron ke maan is prakaar samanjit kiye jate hai ki paripath kii aavriti grahya sanket kii aavriti ke tulya ho jaae
 In that case, the circuit is called convergent for the said signal
 etdarth prerakatvon evam sandharitron ke maan nimnlikhit sutara ke anusaar niyat kiye jate hai : Where is the inductance of the inductor, capacitance of the capacitor and the acceptable signal frequency
 is prakaar samaswarit paripath keval usee aavriti ke sanketon kaa varan kar grahan karata he jo uski aavriti ke tulya hai shesh ko chhantakar vilag kar detaa he
 In good collection plants, several circuits are arranged in series order that sufficiently increases the variability, or selectivity, of the collector
 antena se praapt radio sanket atyant ksheen hote hai
 For this reason they are unable to execute the loudspeaker
 at: unki shakti ko paryaapt pravardhit kar sakane kii kshamta sangrahi main honi chahie
 The amplification system is then combined
 preshak kendron se sangrahi ke antena tak aanevaali sanketavahini tarangen atyant ucch aavriti kii hoti hai
 Therefore, after entering the collection, it is necessary to transform them into auditions
 in shravyavritiyon ko pruthak kar dhvanivistaarak main pravisht karne ke pashchaat hi sanket ko sun sakna sambhav hota he radio tarangon ko dhwani tarangon main parinat karne ke hetu prayukt tantra-vyavastha ko sansuchak yukti kehete hai The power of the audiovisual signals emitted from the detector is greatly impaired, leaving it unable to execute the loudspeaker
 at: laudspikar main pravisht hone ke purv isko paryaapt maatra main pravardhit karnaa aavashyak hota he
 The system used for this is called audiovisual amplifier
 shravyavriti sanketon ko vidyut se dhwani main roopantarit karne ke liye laudspikar yaa shiraphone bhi sangrahi set kaa ek mukhya bhaag hota he
 It is also called converged radio frequency receiver
 yah sangrahi kisi vishesh radio aavritiyon ke liye samaswarit rahata he
 All the circuits inside it are either synchronized to the desired radio frequency, or they are arranged in such a way that the frequency is synchronized all together
 puraane dhang ke aise sangrahi main aise prayek paripath ke saath ek pruthak samaswarak sandharitra hota tha, kintu aadhunik seton main ek hi parivartaneey, yaa char sandharitra se sabhi paripathon kaa is prakaar sanyukt kar diya jaataa he ki sandharitra ko ghumaane par uske bhinn bhinn dharitansh maano se bhinn bhinn paripath jud jate hai
 For a detailed article, see - Superheterodyne Collection pratham vishwayuddh ke dauraan major edwin armastrang naamak vaigyanik ne saral sangrahi main apekshit sudhaar kar aisi sangrahi vyavastha ko janm diya jisamen kisi bhi aavriti ke sanket ko kisi samay sugamawa se grahan kiya ja saktaa he
 This system is in fact the father of modern popular radio-based sets
 swachaalit vaahan, jaise motor car, yaa vayuyan ityadi, main prayukt radio sangrahi ke seton kii rachana saadhaaran grihopayogi seton se thodaa sa bhinn hoti he
 These include the required voltages for power and heat taken from the vehicle's conductor battery and inserted into a vibrator, or rotational converter, to be augmented to the desired frequency
 is prakaar ke set kaa arial ek patali dhaatu nalika hoti he, jo car ke ek parshv par, vayuyan ke daine par sidhi khadi lagaai jaati he
 The latest models of this type of set are equipped with assemblers and volume control steer lashing, so that the collection can be handled conveniently
 radio sangrahi ko adhik upyogi, sasta tathaa suvahya banane ke hetu vaalvon ke sthaan par transistor kaa upyog kiya jane laga he
 This set is powered by a battery of only four and a half to six volts and its efficiency, that is, the ratio of power given to it and its available power, is six to ten times greater than that of a normal valve collector
 isse iskaa rakh rakhv vyay valve transistor se 4 yaa 5 guna kam hota he
 In addition, they are very small, portable and inexpensive
 sugrahi to ye itane adhik hote hai ki ek saamaanya pherite chad arial kii sahaayta se hi inhen kriyanvit kiya ja saktaa he
 With the introduction of integrated circuits, inexpensive, small, low cell feeders and good service radio collectors have become available with the help of a single IC or a few chips
