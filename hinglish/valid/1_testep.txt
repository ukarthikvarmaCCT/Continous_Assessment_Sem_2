 Rigveda-samhita's verses are often divided on the basis of the subject and style in this way- devstutiparakasukt Philosophical book loukik sookt Dialog box aakhyaan sookt aadi
 a brief introduction by some prominent Suktas, which are highly popular and important, sheds light on the broader subject of this Samhita
 samvaad sookhton kii vyakhya or taatpary vaidic vidwaanon kaa ek vichaarneey vishay rahaa he; kyonki vaartalap karne waalon ko maatr vyakti maananaa sambhav nahin he
 The elements contained in these narratives and dialogues have given rise to the narrative and drama genres of literature in the postwar period
 iske atirikt, aprisukt, danstutisukt, aadi kuch duusare sookt bhi apni style or vishay ke kaaran pruthak rup se ulilakhit kiye jate hai
 Thus, in addition to the praises of the Vedic deities, the Samhita of the Rig Veda is the oldest Aasha Granth to throw light on the difference between philosophy, cosmic knowledge, environment, science, narration and so on

 aisa hi prayek manushya ko karnaa chahie
 No one should let their children be deprived of knowledge

 aaj ke chote se laabh-haani kii tulana main ve doorvartti haani-laabh ko mahatva dete hai or itnaa saahas or dhairya banaaye rahete hai
 On the basis of this, the distant people can bear a little trouble in the present for great profit or consider the future loss as a form of difficulties and can abandon the small temptation or attraction of today
 vichaaron or varnon ko suvyavasthit banane ke liye kiya hua shram-ganesh kii aradhana ke liye kiya gaya tap hi maananaa chahie

 saraswati mata hamaari pratyaksh devi hai-adhyayan ke dwaara hi unki aradhana hoti he
 Studies like worship, diet, bathing, sleeping etc

84 Equipments - The purity of the medium and after worshiping Saraswati, the instruments of education - Dawat, pen and bandage are worshiped
 shiksha prapti ke liye yah teenon hi pradhan upkaran hai
 They are invoked by Vedantras, so that their initial effect can be welfare
 vidya prapti main sahaayta mil sake
 All three are consecrated with mantras, so that purity can be kept constant in these instruments
 upkarnon kii pavitrataa har kaary main aavashyak he
 Only if the means are pure, only the excellence of the practicable can be maintained
 galat upayon se, dooshit upkarnon se yadi koi safalataa praapt kar bhi lee jaae, to us safalataa kaa laabh utana sukhprad nahin hota, jitna ki anupyukt madhyamon ko apnaane main bigadaa apana swabhaav apane liye doorgaami ahit evam anisht utpann karata he
 Just as milk kept in a clean utensil is drinkable, keeping it in dirty and dirty dishes causes it to burst and causes disease disorder on drinking, similarly what is done with inappropriate equipment, how much is it from outside Whether it looks good or how successful it is, it is undesirable
 vidyarambh sanskaar kaa prayojan yah he ki shikshaarthi kaa dhyaan vidya kii mahatta evam upkarnon kii pavitrataa kii ore aakarshith kiya jaae
 The study is only for the purpose, in fact the sanctity of the instruments is an ideal approach, which should be adopted in every field
 ham jo kuch bhi kaary, vyavhaar evam prayog karen, usamen is baat kaa puraa-puraa dhyaan rakhen ki kisi pralobhan yaa jaldbaaji main anupyukt sadhano kaa upyog na kiya jaae
 All your equipment should be completely pure

 The three goddesses in the Shodash matriarchy represent the three emotions, which are fundamental to the attainment of learning
 vidyarambh sanskaar main kalam-pujan kaa mantra bolte samay dhruthi kaa aavahan karte hai
 In the prescribed mantras, they are worshiped only
 vidyarambh karte hue pehle kalam haath main leni padati he
 Dhriti, the goddess of the pen, has a sense of interest
 vidya praapt karne vaale ke antajkaran main yadi uske liye abhiruchi hogi, to pragati ke samast saadhan banate chale jaayenge
 There is no reading without awakening interest, any work seems to be a form of weight, there is no mind in it, the works done with half-hearted mind remain busy and absurd
 aisi dasha main koi ullekhneey safalataa bhi nahin milti
 a sharp intellect and a good brain also do not prove to be particularly useful, but if there is a keen interest in reading, then the slow intellect also makes a surprising progress on the strength of their studies
 abhibhavakon ko karttavya he ki shikshaarthi kii abhiruchi jagaayen, use vidya prapti ke laabh bataaen
 Tell their examples, who, being educated, were able to earn money, fame and convenience in attaining higher status
 saath hi aise udhaaharan bhi sunaane chahie, jinamein paariwarik sukh sadhano se santusht ladakon ne padhane main upeksha kii or ant main saadhan jab bikhar gayi, tab unhen apane ashikshit, aviksit vyaktitv ke aadhaar par jivan-yaapan ke saadhan jutaney main kitni kathinaayee uthaani padi
 Education is respect for mankind and being uneducated is an insult
 ashikshit yaa swalp shikshit rahanaa kisi vyakti ke paariwarik yaa vyaktitv str ke gire hue hone kaa hi pramaan mana jaataa he
 Everyone should be saved and saved from this insult
 'dhruthi' kii abhiyojna kalam kaa pujan karaate samay is prakaar kii jaae ki shikshaarthi kii abhiruchi adhyayan main nirantar badhati chali jaae
 The worship material should be given in the hands of the child

 It should be realized that Dhriti Shakti is refining the child's interest in learning

30 The pen is used by medicine
 syaahi yaa khadiya ke sahare hi kalam kuch likh paati he
 That is why the number of worship of Dawat comes after the pen
 dawaat kii adhishthatri devi 'pushti' hai
 The sense of confirmation is concentration
 ekaagratha se adhyayan kii prakriya gatisheel-agragamini hoti he
 No matter how many people have strong intelligence, the brain works well, they also want to study, but the mind runs in many directions, does not concentrate, is fickle, and the mind does not develop in the subject presented
 aise dawandol man vaale shikshaarthi kii pragati sandigdh bani rahati he
 When the mind does not feel, will the brain take hold? In the beginning, the students who are considered to have a slow intellect have been seen to be very talented in future
 ashchayrjanak parivartan ke peeche unki ekaagratha hi pradhan kaaran hoti he
 Kalava is tied in the throat of Dawat and worshiped with roli, incense, akshat, flowers etc
 yah dawaat kii adhishthatri devi 'pushti' kaa abhivandan he
 The purpose of this puja is that the importance of concentration should be explained to the learner and it should also be made practical practice
 samuchit maatra main abhiruchi ho or saath hi ekaagratha kaa abhyaas ho jaae, to phir vidya laabh kii disha main aashajanak safalataa sambhav ho jaati he
 Pooja material should be made with chanting with the hand of the child on the medicine set on the altar of worship

 kalam, dawaat kii vyavastha ho jane par uskaa upyog pattee yaa kapi-kaagaj par hi hota he, inaki adhishthatri 'tushti' he
 The feeling of satisfaction is laboriousness
 adhyayan ke liye shram kii bhi utani hi aavashyaktaa he, jitani kii abhiruchi evam ekaagratha kii
 a student is also interested in reading, also concentrates in the mind, but does not work due to lazy nature, gets bored quickly and ends up studying and gets engaged in other work, then the bad luck of not working hard for long He shatters his other features
 jis prakaar bhautik nimarntmak kaaryon kii safalataa shaareerik shram par nibharr rahati he, usee tarah maansik uplabdhiyaan, maansik shram par avalambit hai
 Nothing can be achieved in this world without labor
 saadhan kitne hi prachur evam prakhar kyon na hon, unka laabh to tabhi milegaa, jab unka upyog kiya jaayegaa
 Labor in use is neglected
 isliye shikshaarthi ko parishramee bhi hona chahie
 He should make a practice of working hard by studying hard
 yah aadat jis prakaar pade, uskaa upaay abhibhavakon ko karnaa chahie
 Along with worshiping bandi, dawat, pen, all the three instruments are also done with the fact that all our instruments are sacred
 vidya bhi pavitra sadhano se pavitra uddeshyon kii putir ke liye praapt kii jaae
 On the basis of interest, concentration and labor, education should be extended to the important path of profit
 balak dwaara mantrocchar ke saath puja sthal par sthapit pattee par pujan saamagree apirt karai jaae
 It is to be realized that with this service, the child is establishing contact with appeasement power
 us shakti se parishram, sadhana karne kii kshamta kaa vikaas hoga

 One has to go to the teacher's association to get education
 jis prakaar gau apane bachade ko doodh pilaati he, usee tarah guru apane shishy ko vidya rupi amrit pilaate hai
 It is necessary to have mutual devotion and goodwill in this process
 gaay or bachade ke bich prem na ho, to doodh pilaane kii prakriya kaise chale? isi prakaar shikshaarthi ke prati vatsalya na rakhe, to upree man se rukhaai ke saath sikhaane kaa kaary saraheen hi rahegaa
 Just as the money of hard-earned money flourishes, similarly what is learned by gaining reverence, goodwill towards the Guru and receiving his affection and respect, proves beneficial in life

 After worshiping pen, dawat, bandi, the Guru, who starts education, should offer obeisance by offering flowers, garlands, kalava, tilak, aarti, fruits etc
 is pujan kaa prayojan he ki shikshaarthi apane shikshakon ke prati pita jaisi shraddha rakhen, unhen samay-samay par pranaam, abhivadan kare, samuchit shishtachar barte, anushaasan maane or jaisaa ve nidersh karen, vaisaa aacharan kare

 sanathan dharm: apane mul rup hindu dharm ke vaikalpik naam se janaa jaataa he
 In the Vedic period, the name 'sanatan Dharma' is found for the religion of the Indian subcontinent
 'sanathan' kaa arth he - shaashvat yaa 'hameshaa bana rahane vaala', arthath jiskaa na aadi he na ant
 Sanatan Dharma is basically Indian religion, which was spread all over Greater India at one time
 vibhinn kaarnon se hue baari dharmantaran ke baad bhi vishwa ke is kshetra kii bahusankhyak aabaadi isi dharm main aasthaa rakhti he
 Residents across the Indus River were called Iranians by Hindus, who used to pronounce 'H'
 unki dekha-dekhi arab hamalavar bhi tatkaaleen bharatvasiyon ko hindu or unke dharm ko hindu dharm kehane lage
 The word Hindu is found in India's own literature some 1000 years ago, not before that
 hindutv sanathan dharm ke rup main sabhi dharmon kaa muladhar he kyonki sabhi dharm-siddhanton ke saarvbhaum aadhyatmik satya ke vibhinn pahaluon kaa isamen pehle se hi samavesh kar liya gaya tha
 ‚Äîrigveda-3-18-1 sanathan dharm jise hindu dharm athwa vaidic dharm bhi kaha jaataa he, kaa 1960853110 saal kaa itihaas hai
 Many signs of Hinduism are found in the Indus Valley Civilization of India
 inamen ek agyaat matrudevi kii murtiyan, shiv pashupati jaise devtaa kii mudraayen, ling, pipal kii puja, ityadi pramukh hai
 According to a view of historians, during the end of this civilization another caste came from Central Asia, who called themselves Aryans and spoke a Sanskrit called indo-european language
 ek anya drushtikon ke anusaar sindhu ghati sabhyataa ke log swayan hi arya the or unka moolsthaan bharat hi tha
 In ancient times, there were five sects in Indian Sanatana Dharma called GƒÅnapatya, Shaivadeva: Koti Vaishnava, Shakta and Saura
 gaanpaty ganeshaki, vaishnav vishnu kii, shaivadev:koti shiv kii, shakt shakti kii or saura surya kii puja aradhana kiya karte the
 But it was believed that all are interpretations of the same truth
 yah na keval rugveda parantu ramayana or mahabharat jaise lokapriy granthon main bhi spasht rup se kaha gaya he
 The supporters of each sect considered their deity to be greater than the deity of other sects and for this reason there was disharmony among them
 ekta banaae rakhane ke uddeshy se dharmaguruon ne logon ko yah shiksha dena armbh kiya ki sabhi devtaa samaan hai, vishnu, shiv or shakti aadi devi-devtaa paraspar ek duusare ke bhi bhakt hai
 These teachings matched their three sects and originated the Sanatan Dharma
 sanathan dharm main vishnu, shiv or shakti ko samaan mana gaya or teenon hi sampradaay ke samarthak is dharm ko maanane lage
 All literature of Sanatan Dharma has been composed in Sanskrit language like Vedas, Puranas, Shruti, Smriti, Upanishads, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Gita etc
 kaalaantar main bharatvarsh main musalmaan shashan ho jane ke kaaran devbhasha sanskrit kaa hraas ho gaya tathaa sanathan dharm kii avnati hone lagi
 To rectify this situation, the scholar Saint Tulsidas protected Sanatan Dharma by composing religious literature in the prevailing language
 jab aupniveshik british shashan ko isai, muslim aadi dharmon ke maanane waalon kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan karne ke liye janaganana karne kii aavashyaktaa padi to sanathan shabd se aparichit hone ke kaaran unhone yahan ke dharm kaa naam sanathan dharm ke sthaan par hindu dharm rakh diya
 'sanatan Dharma' is the real name of Hinduism
 satya do dhaatuon se milakar bana he sat or tat
 This means Sat and Tat means that
 donon hi satya he
 Ego Brahmasmi and Tattvamsi
 arthath main hi brahm hoon or tum hi brahm ho
 This entire world is cosmic
 brahm purna he
 This world is also complete
 purna jagat kii utpatti purna brahm se hui he
 There is no inferiority in the perfection of Brahm even when the whole world is created from the complete Brahman
 vah shesh rup main bhi purna hi rahata he
 This is the eternal truth
 sanathan main aadhunik or samasamyik chunautiyon kaa saamana karne ke liye isamen samay samay par badlaav hote rahe hai, jaise ki raja ram mohan raay, swami dayanand, swami vivekanand aadi ne sati pratha, bal vivaah, asprishyata jaise asuvidhajanak paramparaagat kuritiyon se asahaj mahasoos karte rahe
 Those Shloko-mantras present in the roots of these evils are called "transgressors" or changed their meanings and declared them to be sacrosanct, then revived many old traditions like widow marriage, female education etc
 yadhyapi aaj sanathan kaa paryaay hindu he par buddha, jain dharmavalambi bhi apane aap ko sanatani kehete hai, kyonki buddha bhi apane ko sanatani kehete hai
 Even atheists who follow Charvak philosophy are Sanatani
 sanathan dharmi ke liye kisi vishisht paddati, karmkand, veshbhusha ko maananaa jaruri nahin
 He is born in a Sanatanadharmi family, believes in any philosophy like Vedanta, Mimamsa, Charvak, Jain, Buddhist, etc
 It is enough for him to be Sanatani
 sanathan dharm kii gutthiyon ko dekhte hue kai baar ise kathin or samajhane main mushkil dharm samajha jaataa he
 However, the truth is not such, yet it has so many dimensions, so many aspects that people often get confused about it
 sabase bada kaaran iskaa yah ki sanathan dharm kisi ek darshanik, manisha yaa rishi ke vichaaron kii upaj nahin he, na hi yah kisi khaas samay paidaa hua
 It has been flowing and evolving since time immemorial
 saath hi yah keval ek drushtaa, siddhant yaa tark ko bhi variyata nahin detaa
 When science evaluates every object, idea and element, in the process, many beliefs and principles of religion collapse

 Our sages and sages had expressed it clearly by knowing the mystery of Brahma, the universe and the soul in a deep state of meditation and salvation
 vedon main hi sarvapratham brahm or brahmad ke rahasy par se pardaa hataakar 'moksh' kii dharna ko pratipaadit kar uske mahatv ko samajhaayaa gaya tha
 Without salvation, there is no movement of the soul, that is why the sages have considered the path of salvation as the eternal path

 naunivesh yaa godi yaa 'dock' jalayanon ke thaharne ke sthaan ko kehete hai
 If the place is not completely surrounded, but its face is always open to come from the sea, then the name 'basin' is more suitable for it, although the name is not universal
 godiyon ke mukh par phatak yaa kothiyaan lagi hoti hai, jisase unamem yathechh tal tak pani rakhaa ja sake
 The dock in which the water usually stays up to the same floor is called the Sajal dock and the dock from which the water can be emptied completely is called the 'dry dock'
 sukhi godi main jahaaj nirikshan karne yaa marammat karne ke liye laae jate hai
 One form of dry dock is 'tirati Docki'
 yah tairte hue bade bade pipon kii sanrachana hoti he, jo bheetar pani bharkar, yaa khaali karke, nichi yaa unchi kii ja sakati he or jahaaj usapar rakhkar pani ke upar uthaaya ja saktaa he
 Ports that have a naturally safe and deeply massive basin, low tide and no strong currents in the sea, do not require a prostitute dock, such as in New York
 kintu sukhi yaa tirti godi sabhi bade aadhunik pattanon kaa anivaary ang hoti he
 There is a natural or deep dug-out subdivision on the seashore or riverbank, on the banks of which paved ghats or platforms are made for loading or unloading goods in ships
 yadi ye tat ke samaantar hote he, to parshvaghat yaa dhakka kehalaate hai
 And if the water entering the water is made perpendicular or at any other angle, then it is called Paia
 ghat, dhakke yaa paae sajal godi ke mukhya ang hai
 Sometimes the sloping ghats are also built, which can be high and low along the tide
 ye chal pulon dwaara achal ghaaton se jude rahete hai
 Dock walls are made very strong
 ye praaia: dhan kancreet kii, akhand kancreet kii, sampidit vaayu dwaara galaai gai kothiyon kii, prabalit kancreet main pendayukta dholon kii, yaa sthunon, dholon aadi kii mishrit deevaaren hoti hai
 On top of these, there is definitely a title of granite
 aajkal jahaaj praaia: baxnuma banate hai
 Their walls stand upright or sometimes lean upwards
 isliye ghat kii deevaaren saamne kii ore bilkul khadi yaa lagbhag khadi banaai jaati hai, taaki jahaaj ghat ke bilkul paas tak aa saken or naubhaar chadhaane utaaranevaali crenon kii pahunch ke bheetar ho sake
 The walls are made of flowers, whose back surface is sloping or terraced
 inaki niven kaaphi chaudee hoti hai, taaki neeche mitti par uski kshamta se adhik bhaar na pade
 The foundation is also laid some sloping at the back, so that the pressure of the filling does not slide towards the wall
 diwaar ke achal bhaar tathaa peeche kii bharaai kii thel kaa dhyaan rakhkar deevaaron kaa abhikalpan kiya jaataa he
 Their average thickness is not less than a quarter of the height, often a third is laid
 aadhaar par chaudaai oonchaai kii aadhi se lekar do tihaai tak hoti he
 The watercourse is placed at about 50-50 feet in the wall, so that when the bottom of the water in the front is low, then the back water can drain
 jahaan jowar bhaata bahut unchaa aata he, vahaan bade bade basin gherkar praaia: band kar liye jate hai or pani ek hi tal par banaae rakhane ke liye bade bade phatak laga die jate hai
 When the ebb starts after the tide, these gates are closed, which keeps the water high in the dock
 is prakaar kii godiyaan, 'band godiyaan kehalaati hai
 The entrance gate has two pallets, which, when closed, are joined together over a raised body
 dwaar kaaphi lanbaa hota he
 Its walls have wide wide grooves, in which the pallets openly penetrate
 jab phatak band hota he, tab usapar padanevaali pani kii thel rokane ke liye bhi deevaaren pushton kaa kaam karti hai
 These gates can be opened only for a short time, ie only when the tide comes
 isliye simit avaagaman hi ho saktaa he
 Made too long for possible traffic possible jaataa he or iske donon siron par phatak lagaae jate hai
 This creates a water reservoir in the middle - the same as that used for traffic near lakes in canals
 jalpash mahange to hote hai or dwaar kii apeksha jagah bhi gherte hai, kintu din raat kaam aa sakate hai
 Therefore, these are usually made in modern big ports
 inamen ikhare phatak yadi hote bhi hai, to keval sahaayak dwarron ke rup main hi
 There are large watercourses or culverts in the side walls to make the water of the water high or low
 aadhunik bade jalpashon main praaia: bich main bhi ek phatak hota he, jisase jalpash ke do bhaag kiye ja sakate hai or unamem chote chote jahaaj rakhe ja sakate hai
 Where a very high tide or fierce waves arise at the entrance, to protect the gates, a gate opening in the opposite direction from them is placed outside
 yah tufaani phatak kehalaata he
 Dock gates are of wood or steel
 harithhrut, jarrah, yaa anya baari or kathor lakdi inamen lagaai jaati he
 Brackish water has a bad effect on iron and if it is mixed with sewage, then more
 isliye ispaat ke phatak lagbhag 30 varsh hi chalate hai, jabaki lakdi ke lagbhag 50 varshon tak chal jate hai
 The weight of wooden gates is also less
 liverpool godi kaa phatak 90 foot chaudaa or foot unchaa he
 One wall of its grizzly is only 165 tons in weight, while one table of steel from London's 80-foot-wide, foot-high gate is 185 tons
 lakdi ke phatakon kii laagat ispaat ke phatakon kii apeksha lagbhag 50 pratishat adhik hoti he : They are considered good with gates, because there is no need to place big grooves in the walls to give them space
 kothiyon main bagal main or neeche kii ore harithhrut kaa samparkprishth bana hota he, jisapar rabar laga hota he taaki dwaar main thik feet hokar yah pani roak de
 In order to reduce their load as per requirement, water tanks are kept inside them and pumps, valves etc
 are kept for emptying them
 dwarkothiyaan do prakaar kii hoti hai : They can also be square, but most are vessel-like in shape
 inamen koi nirdisht chaalan vyavastha nahin hoti, balki tairaakar yathasthaan le jaai jaati hai
 It is not easy to handle them in mild weather, or in high currents
 ye chaukor hoti hai or nirdisht chaalanvyavastha ke anusaar do prakaar kii hoti hai - sarkanevaali kothiyon main lakdi ke gutke lage rahete hai, jinke bal ve chinai ke upar bane raste par khiskaakar yathasthaan pahunchaai jaati hai
 The second type is the wheel chambers, which run on the tracks on the dehal
 kabhi pahie farsh par or patariyaan kothiyon main lagi hoti he
 When the transverse cells are moved to open the gates, they penetrate the long wrinkles inside the wall
 sukhi godiyon main ek yaa adhik jahaaj andar laakar, phatak band karke panpon dwaara pani nikaal dene kaa prabandh rahata he
 Its walls and pendants are laced with water-repellent materials, such as concrete-masonry brick or granite
 jahaan unche jowar bhaate aayaa karte hai, vahaan kabhi kabhi unka laabh uthaakar jowar ke samay jahaaj andar le aate hai or bhaate ke baad phatak band kar dete hai
 Thus there is no need to drain water by pump
 jahaajon ke nirmaan, nirikshan or marammat aadi ke liye sukhi godiyaan sabhi jagah aavashyak samajhi jaati hai or inke abhikalp ke samay bhavi vistaar kii gunjaaish bhi rakhi jaati he
 The usefulness of a dry dock is judged in terms of how long a ship can come
 bombai kii godi, jo san 1914 main chaalu hui, 1,000 foot lambii, 100 foot chaudee or 34 foot 9 inch gahari he
 It was the second in the world's dock at that time
 iske pehle hi san 1913 main, liverpool kii 1,050 foot 4 inch lambii, 12 foot chaudee or 43 foot 11 inch gahari, gladston godi taiyaar ho chuki thi
 Now the 1,212-foot-6-inch long, 148-foot-wide and 45-foot deep dry dock of Cape Town, commissioned in 1945, is the largest in the world
 tirti godiyon ko uthaane kii samarthy 300 ton se 1,00,000 ton tak hoti he
 The Campbell design was very prevalent before the Second World War, according to which a 60,000-tonne sloping dock was built to accommodate the largest Atlantic liners and warships in Sadhampton
 baad main to or bhi badi badi godiyon kii aavashyaktaa kaa anubhav hua
 The 54,000-tonne 'admiralty Tilti Dock of Portsmith is 859 feet 6 inches long and 129 feet 6 inches wide inside
 yah pani main 38 foot doobnevaala jahaaj uthaa sakati he
 The 50,000-tonne 857-foot 8-inch-long, 126-foot-6-inch-wide and 40-foot-deep dock was built in Bombay in 1947 to replace the Singapore dock destroyed by Bamnarsha in World War II, which later reached Malta
 Has gone
 tirti godiyaan badi saralata or teji se taiyaar kii ja sakati hai, sthanantarit kii ja sakati hai or sthitvishesh ke anukool dhaali ja sakati hai
 Therefore, they are more valuable than dry dock for emergency repair of ships
 kintu lohe yaa ispaat kii hone ke kaaran ye 30-40 varsh se adhik nahin chalatin
 They also need safe space and more depth
 jahaan 500 foot lambey, 55 foot chaude or 28 foot duubakar chalanevaale jahaaj ke liye 520 foot lambii, 60 foot chaudee or 30 foot gahari sukhi godi paryaapt hogi, vahaan tirti godi jahaaj ke neeche jane ke liye 20 foot gaharaai or legi; or yadi 15-20 foot unchaa jowar bhaata aata he, to tirti godi ke liye lagbhag 70 foot gaharaa pani chahie
 If the natural depth is not so much, then so much will have to be done by dredging
 saamaanya paristhitiyon main yah kathin hi nahin, praaia: asambhav he
 Yes, the length of the sloping dock is not mandatory to be more than the width of the ship, only its lifting capacity should be greater than the weight of the ship
 tirti godiyaan kai prakaar kii hoti hai
 Some have both more walls, some have only one more
 donon or diwarwali godiyon main bakse jaisi, kabla-yojya khandonwali or peepa khandon vaali godiyon kaa bahut prachlan he
 The modern dock with capacitive blocks has all the qualities of a box-like dock

 It consists of three sections of approximately the same length, all of which can be folded in a straight line, placed and two walls on either side are tightened by cables
 inamen kuch peepe nikaalkar, shesh pipon ke upar deevaaron ke bich lambaai kii disha main rakhe ja sakate hai
 First built for the Spanish government of Havana, the Havana-type dock consists of two steep walls, between which the caskets are attached to the cables
 inamen se koi bhi peepa nikaalkar shesh ke upar rakhaa ja saktaa he
 This type is now ancient
 ek ore diwarwali godi kii do kismein prasiddh hai
 The offshore dock was patented in 1884 AD
 isaki diwaar tat ke ke saath kabje lage gadanron dwaara judi hoti he
 The dock is in two sections and one section can be placed on top of the other
 ek hi ore diwaar hone ke kaaran isamen jahaaj teen ore se chadaaye ja sakate hai
 The second type of dock is called the deposit dock, which was patented in 1877
 isamen diwaar to lambii hoti he, kintu neeche pipon ke bich bich jagah rahati he, arthath diwaar main peepe is prakaar lage hote hai jaise haath main ungliyaan
 Ships mounted on these casks can be placed on the coast of the burrows built on the coast and the dock can be emptied
 yah bhi do khandon main hoti he, jo ek duusare ke upar rakhe ja sakate hai
 For stability, these segments are connected to a sloping ulari, or stoplever, by parallel punishments attached to the hinge
 ye pot parivahan ke liye atyant aavashyak hai
 Modern ports must have adequate arrangements for them
 inkaa uddeshy yah he ki samudr se aasaani se pot aa ja saken, unhen paryaapt tathaa surakshit ghat mili, naubhaar teji se chadhaane utaarne kii suvidha ho, ghaaton par naubhaar laane or vahaan se le jane kii tathaa aavashyaktaa ho to use godaam main rakhane kii, samuchit vyavastha ho
 By improving these facilities, often a lot of expenses incurred in the expansion of the docks can be saved
 naubhaar se nipatane kii vidhiyaan vibhinan pattanon main bhinn bhinn hoti hai
 Elsewhere, goods are unloaded directly on trains, or loaded into other trains
 kahin par bade jahaajon se maal chote jahaajon par utaar liya jaataa he
 Somewhere both these methods are adopted
 saamaanya naubhaar ke liye praaia: prayek nikaas sthal par teen teen ton ke ek ek dock kraine lagaae jate hai
 The average weight of most bundles is usually 30 hunderweight
 isse baari boj uthaane ke liye 10 se 20 ton kshamtawale tirte kraine kaa prayog karnaa acha rahata he
 The system of lifting about 2,000 tonnes of normal cargo per day is considered good

 The city of Los Angeles is also the administrative headquarters of Los Angeles County and is the most densely populated and highly diverse county in the United States
 is county main rahane waalon ko "anzliens" kahkar sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 Los Angeles was founded in 1781 by Spanish Governor Felipe de Neve

 In this sense, it is the fourteenth largest city in the United States by area
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles 
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960
 The city is located in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 ¬∞ C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 ¬∞ f warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 ¬∞F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 ¬∞F, with overnight lows of 63 ¬∞F 
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 ¬∞F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 ¬∞F and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34¬∞ north
 The median temperature in January is 57 ¬∞ f and 73 ¬∞ f in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 ¬∞ f in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 ¬∞ f in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 ¬∞ f on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 ¬∞ f on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical coral tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the bird of paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions

 Bahadur Shah Zafar was the last emperor of the Mughal Empire in India and a noted poet of Urdu
 unhone 1857 kaa pratham bhartiya swatantraaa sangram main bhartiya sipaahiyon kaa netritv kiya
 After the defeat in the war, the British sent him to Burma where he died
 jafar kaa janm 24 aktubar, 1775 main hua tha
 His father was Akbar Shah II and mother Lalbai
 apane pita kii mrityu ke baad jafar ko 18 sitambar, 1837 main mughal badshaah banaaya gaya
 It was a matter of fact that by that time the Sultanate of Delhi had become very weak and the Mughal emperor had remained a nominal emperor
 bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane kii jafar ko baari keemat bhi chukaani padi thi
 His sons and great-grandchildren were publicly roasted by the British authorities
 yahi nahin, unhen bandi banaakar rangoon le jaaya gaya, jahaan unhone saat november, 1862 main ek bandi ke rup main dam todaa
 He was buried near the Shvedagon Pagoda in Rangoon
 unke dafan sthal ko ab bahadur shah jafar dargah ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 Even today, when a patriotic person travels to the then Burma, he does not forget to pay tribute to Zafar's tomb
 logon ke dil main unke liye kitna sammaan tha uskaa andaja isi baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ki hindustan main jahaan kai jagah sadakon kaa naam unke naam par rakhaa gaya he, vahiin pakistan ke lahore shahar main bhi unke naam par ek sadak kaa naam rakhaa gaya he
 Victoria Park in Old Dhaka city of Bangladesh has been renamed Bahadur Shah Zafar Park
 1857 main jab hindustan kii aazaadee kii chingaari bhadki to sabhi vidrohi sainikon or raja-maharaajaaon ne unhen hindustan kaa samraat mana or unke netritv main angrejon kii eent se eent baja di
 Bahadur Shah Zafar also got angry after seeing the rebellion of Indian soldiers against the British and called for the British to be driven out of India
 bharatiyon ne dilli or desh ke anya hisson main angrejon ko kadi shikast di
 Initial results favored the Indian warriors, but later, due to the deception of the British, the stand of the first freedom struggle changed and the British managed to suppress the rebellion
 bahadur shah jafar ne humayun ke makbare main sharan lee, lekin major hads ne unhen unke bete mirza mughal or khijar sultan va pote abu bakar ke saath pakad liya
 The British crossed all limits of oppression
 jab bahadur shah jafar ko bhukh lagi to angrej unke saamne thali main paroskar unke beton ke sir le aae
 He replied to the British that the sons of India sacrifice their heads for the country and come to their father in the same manner
 aazaadee ke liye hui baghawat ko puri tarah khatm karne ke makasad se angrejon ne antim mughal badshaah ko desh se nirvasit kar rangoon bhej diya
 Bahadur Shah Zafar was not only a patriotic Mughal emperor but also a famous Urdu poet
 unhone bahut si mashhoor urdu kavitaayen likhin, jinamein se kaaphi angrejon ke khilaaf baghawat ke samay machi uthal-puthal ke dauraan kho gai yaa nasht ho gai
 The lines written by him in Urdu are also very famous - ,,, Ek aisa ghar chahiye mujh Ko jiski faza mastana Ho Ek kone mein ghazal ki mahfil Ek kone mein maykhana Ho
 ,,, desh se baahar rangoon main bhi unki urdu kavitaaon kaa jalawaa jari rahaa
 He was always worried about India there
 unki antim ichha thi ki vah apane jivan kii antim saans hindustan main hi len or vahiin unhen dafnaaya jaae lekin aisa nahin ho paaya
 i do not think that my desolation is in love, what is made of alam-e-naapidar bulbul ko bagbaan se na saiyaad se gilaa,kismat main kaid likhi thi fasal-e-bahaar main
 Tell them to settle somewhere else from these haunts, where is this place in dil-e-daagdar
 ek shaakh gul pe baith ke bulbul he shaadamaan,kaante bicha die hai dil-e-laal-e-zaar main
 Age-a-drawer had brought four days of demand, two were cut in the beginning, two were waiting
 din zindagi khatm hue shaam ho gai,failaa ke paanv soyenge kunj-e-mazaar main
 How much is it for unfortunate 'zafar' dafn, two gaz zameen not found in ku-e-yaar bahadur shah jafar jaise kam hi shaasha hote hai jo apane desh ko mahabuuba kii tarah mohabbat karte hai or ku-e-yaar main jagah na mil paane kii kasak ke saath pardes main dam tod dete hai
 This was the basic difference with the fundamental Indian ideology which considers its country as its mother
 badshaah jafar ne jab rangoon main karawas ke dauraan apni aakhri saans lee to shaayad unke labon par apni hi mashhoor ghazal kaa yah sher jarur rahaa hoga- "kitna he badanaseeb jafar dafn ke liye, do gaj jameen bhi na mili ku-e-yaar main
 " bharat ke pratham swatantraaa sangram main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaane vaale antim mughal badshaah bahadur shah jafar urdu ke ek bade shaayar ke rup main bhi vikhyath hai
 His poetry was filled with patriotism rather than sentimental poets and this was the reason that he warned the British rulers to walk to Shamsheer of Hindustan till the planks-london
 janashrutiyon ke anusaar pratham swatantraaa sangram ke baad jab badshaah jafar ko giraftaar kiya gaya to urdu jaanane vaale ek angrej sainya adhikari ne un par kataaksh karte hue yah sher kaha- "dam main dam nahin, ab khayr maango jaan kii e jafar ab myaan ho chuki he, shamsheer hindustan kii

!!" is par jafar ne karaara jawaab dete hue kaha tha- "hindio main bu rahegi jab talak imaan kii, takhte landan tak chalegi teg hindustan kii

!!" Zafar, called the last emperor of the Mughal period in India, was made the emperor of Delhi during the First War of Independence
 badshaah banate hi unhone jo chand aadesh die, unamem se ek tha gohatya par roak lagaana
 This order shows how big he was for hindu-muslim unity
 gorakhpur vishvavidhyalay main itihaas ke purv praadhyaapak dow shailanath chaturvedi ke anusaar 1857 ke samay bahadur shah jafar ek aisi badi hasti the, jinka badshaah ke taur par hi nahin ek dharmanirpeksh vyakti ke rup main bhi sabhi sammaan karte the
 That is why it was very natural that the soldiers who reached Delhi after revolting from Meerut made Bahadur Shah Zafar their king first
 chaturvedi ne baatcheet main kaha ki jafar ko badshaah bananaa sankethik rup se british shaskaon ko ek sandesh tha
 Under this, the Indian soldiers wanted to give the message that the Indian ruler would be in power at the center of India, not foreign
 badshaah banane ke baad bahadur shah jafar ne gohatya par pabandi kaa jo aadesh diya tha vah koi nayaa aadesh nahin tha
 Rather, Akbar had given similar orders during his reign
 jafar ne mahaj is aadesh kaa paalan phir se karwaanaa shuru kar diya tha
 Another aspect of Zafar's personality was poetry, along with Deshprem
 unhone na keval gaalib, daag, momin or jock jaise urdu ke bade shaayaron ko tamaam tarah se protsaahan diya, balki vah swayan ek achche shaayar the
 According to literary critics, during the time of Zafar, where Mughal power was in decline, Urdu literature especially Urdu poetry was at its height
 jafar kii maut ke baad unki shaayari "kulliyaat e jafar" ke naam se sankalit kii gayi

 There was no such system or power that could compel states to follow international rules or punish them for breach of rules

 There is excess of blood, blood and pus in milk
 pashu khaanaa-pinaa chhod detaa he evam aruchi se grasit ho jaataa hai
 This disease is commonly found in almost all animals including cows, buffaloes, goats and pigs, which feed their children
 thanaila beemaari pashuon main kai prakaar ke jeevanu, vishaanu, faphund evam yeast tathaa mold ke sankraman se hota hai
 Apart from this, due to injury and seasonal adversities, the bag becomes even

 This disease alone is the biggest impediment in the complete success of the White Revolution with animal wealth development
 is beemaari se puure bharat main prativarsh karodon rupaye kaa nuksaan hota hai, jo atantah pashupalkon kii aarthik sthiti ko prabhavit karata hai
 The udder and milk appear to be quite common in asymptomatic or asymptomatic types of disease, but the disease can be diagnosed by examination of milk in the laboratory

 In some unusual types of disease, the udder rot
 zyaadaatar pashuon main bukhaar aadi nahin hota
 Due to the timely treatment of the disease, normal swelling of the udder becomes irreversible and the udder becomes stiff like wood
 is avasthaa ke baad than se doodh aana sthai rup se band ho jaataa he
 Usually one or two udder are affected initially, which can later spread the disease to other thanad
 kuch pashuon main doodh kaa swaad badal kar namakeen ho jaataa he
 The following types of measures can be taken to identify this invisible disease in time
 iske alaave pashuon kaa uchit rakh rakhaav, than kii rog pratirohak kshamta badhaane vaali aushadhiyon kaa prayog evam rog kaa sasmay uchit ilaj karnaa shreyaskar hai
 Successful treatment of the disease is possible only in the initial stages, otherwise it becomes difficult to save the udder as the disease progresses
 isse bachane ke liye dudharu pashu ke doodh kii jaanch samay par karvaa kar jeevanunashak aushadhiyon dwaara upachaar pashu chikitsak dwaara karwaanaa chahie
 Often these drugs are given by mounting tubes in the udder as well as by injecting them into the muscle
 than main tub chadhaa kar upachaar ke dauraan pashu kaa doodh pine yogya nahin hota
 Therefore, milk should not be used until 48 hours after the last tube is raised
 yah atyant aavashyak he ki upachaar purnroopen kiya jaye, bich main na chhoden
 Apart from this, it should not be hoped that after the animal treatment in the present point of time, normal whole milk will be started
 thanaila beemaari kii rokthaam prabhavi bhang se karne ke liye nimnlikhit vinduon par dhyaan dena aavashyak hai

 Informally, permutation is to arrange a set of some values in a particular order
 is prakaar set ke chah kramchay hai arthath, ,, , or 
 In algebra and especially in group theory, the permutation of a set s is defined as the bisection of s from itself
 For such a map, f is related to the rearrangement of s in which the s element replaces its image f
 combinetorics main, parimit set s kaa kramchay iske tatwon kii soochibaddh punarvyavastha ke rup main paribhaashit he
 In this sense, the permutation of s is different from the rearrangement of its elements
 praarambhik kram vaale set s ke liye, jaise s =, ye dono arth lagbhag pahachaane ja sakate hai: is praarambhik aadesh par pehle arth main kramparivartan lagu karne se tatwon kaa vaikalpik kram praapt hota he, jo duusare arth main kramparivartan he
 The term permutation is used informally to designate the function of the rearrangement of parts of an object, or the result derived from it
 is prakaar kisi shabd ke varnaviparyay ko iske varno kaa kramparivartan ke rup main bhi paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, yaa kah len ki x 3Y +7+Y 2Z bahupadiy x 3Y +Y 2Z +7 ke padon kaa kramparivartan he
 The function of a permutation can also be called a substitution of symbols, for example when say that a permutation of a variable amount of X, Y, z is obtained from x 3Y + y 2Z +7 to y 3Z + z 2X +7
 ek upyukt samametiya samuhik karrwai ko dhyaan main rakhte hue in kathanon ko sateek arth pradaan kiya ja saktaa he In combinatorics the second meaning of "permutation" is sometimes expanded
 praathmik combinetorics main, "kramparivartan or sangyojan" do sambhddha samasyaon kaa hawala detaa he, donon hi n tatv ke set se vishisht k tatv ke chayan kii sambhaavnaaon par nirbhar karti hai, k kramparivartan ke liye chayan ke kram ko dhyaan main rakhaa jaataa he, kintu k -sangyojan ke liye andekha kar diya jaataa he
 Actually the calculation of k-permutation is used as a step towards the calculation of the number { \ displaystyle { \ tbinom {n} {k}}} of the k-combination and the number of permutations of the set n! Is also calculated as tathaapi k -kramparivartan aise kramparivartan ke tab tak anuroop nahin hote jab tak k = n, arthath, chayan main sabhi uplabdh tatv shaamil na hon

 is prakaar m = ke liye, kaa anukram m kaa multiset kramparivartan he, kintu nahin he
 In almost every area of mathematics, permutations occur more or less prominently
 kisi parimit set par bhinn kram lagu kiye jane se ve utpann hote hai, sambhawatah kyonki aise kram ko andekha karte hue ham pataa lagaana chaahate hai ki is prakaar kitne vinyason kii pahchaan hoti he
 For similar reasons, permutation occurs in the study of sorting calculus mathematics in computer science
 bijganit main, samametiya samooh kii sankalpana ke madhyam se kramparivartan kaa vistrut adhyayan karne ke liye ek sampurna vishay samarpit kiya gaya he
 Important to its structure is the possibility of constructing a permutation: the combination defines the third rearrangement, executing two rearrangements in subsequent order
 n vastu ke kramparivartan kii sankhya nirdhaarit karne kaa niyam 1150 ke aasapaas hi hindu samskruti main uplabdh tha: bhartiya ganitagya bhaskar dwaara leelavati main ek anuchhed he jiskaa anuwaad he The product of multiplication of arithmetic series starting from unit and increasing and continuing for several places, will be the conversion of unique numbers

 The development of this work resulted in Galois theory, through the work of Ivaris Galva, which gives a complete description of what is possible and impossible in solving polynomial equations by origin
 aadhunik ganit main isi tarah kii kai sthitiyaan hai, jahaan samasya ko samajhane ke liye sambandhit kramparivartan ke adhyayan kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The concept of permutation is used in the following contexts
 samooh siddhant or sambandhit kshetron main, yadrichhik seton, aparimit kaa bhi kramparivartan hota he
 s is itself a permutation of the bisector set s in itself
 yah kramparivartan kii anumati detaa he, jo kramparivartan ke samoohon ko paribhaashit karata he
 If s is a finite set of n elements, then n! Is a permutation of s
 combinetorics main, ek kramparivartan kaa arth aam taur par ek parimit set se ek baar or keval ek baar prayek tatv se yukt anukram samajha jaataa he
 The concept of a sequence differs from the set in that it contains elements of a sequence in order: the first element of the sequence is the second element and so on
 iske vipareet, set main tatwon kaa koi kram nahin hota, or ek hi set ko nirupit karne ke alag tareeke hai
 In this sense, a permutation of a finite s set of n elements is equivalent to a bisection in S, or selection for the entire sequence of S
 is arth main n ! kramparivartan bhi s kaa he
 The term "permutation" also has a weak meaning that is sometimes used in primary combinatorics texts, naming sequences in which no element appears more than once, but does not require the use of all elements of a defined set
 Lying
 In fact its use often requires considering the order of fixed length k of elements taken from a set of size n> k { \ displaystyle n> k}
 in vastuon ko bina doharaav ke kram ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he, aisa shabd jisase "kramparivartan" ke duusare, aam arthon ke bhram se bachaa jaataa he
 The number of lengths of the order k without repetitions of elements of a set of n sizes is ek sankhya jise n kii k -th hrasaatmak bhajya shakti ke rup main janaa jaataa he or jiske kain duusare naam or ankan prachlit hai
 If m is a finite multiset, then a multiset permutation is the sequence of m elements in which each element appears as many times as m has its plurality
 yadi m ke tatwon kii bahulata m 1 { \ displaystyle m_{1}}, m 2 { \ displaystyle m_{2}}, 


, m l { \ displaystyle m_{l}} he or unka yoga n he, to m ke multiset kramparivartan kii sankhya bahupadiy gunank dwaara di jaati he In group theory, a permutation of a set means a bipartite map, or a bisector from that set itself
 All permutations of any set s form a structure group as the product of the map and the neutral element of the identity
 yah s kaa samametiya samooh he
 As for symmetry, it depends on the countability of the isometric group set, so the nature of the s elements is irrelevant to the structure of the group
 parimit seton ke maamle main samametiya samoohon kaa adhyayan sabase adhik kiya gaya he, jis maamle main yah mana ja saktaa he ki s ={1,2,


,{0}n} kuch prakritik sankhya n ke liye, jo n kii degree ke samametiya samooh ko paribhaashit karata he
 Any subgroup of a symmetric group is called a permutation group
 vastav main keli ke sutara ke anusaar koi bhi samooh kramparivartan samooh ke anuroop he or prayek parimit samooh kisi bhi parimit samametiya samooh kaa upasamooh he
 However, permutation groups have more structure than abstract permutation groups and have different realizations as permutation groups so do not have to be equivalent
 ek parimit s set ke kramparivartan ke liye do mukhya ankan paddatiyaan hai
 In two-line notation, one lists the element of s in the first row and its image in the second row under the permutation for each
 For example, a special permutation of a set can be written as: iskaa matlab he ki œÉ santusht karata he œÉ =2,œÉ =5, œÉ =4,œÉ =3 orœÉ =1
 Alternatively, we can write a permutation using cycle notation, which focuses on the effect of a successful use of a permutation
 yah kramparivartan ko chakra ke utpaada ke rup main vyakt karti he jo kramparivartan kii kakshaon ke anuroop hota he; chunki pruthak kakshaen shithil hoti hai, ise saamaanya rup se kramparivartan kaa "shithil chakron main apghaton" kehete hai
 It works like this: starting from some x element of S, œÉ ‚â† x, write the sequence œÉ of the serial object under œÉ) 


), until the image becomes X, at which point the brackets are closed
 Huh
 likhe gaye maan kaa set x kii kaksha banaata he or koshthakbaddh abhivyakti œÉ kaa samaanuroop chakra detii he
 So it continues to select the x element of s that is not in the class already written and that œÉ ‚â† y writes the corresponding cycle and this sequence continues until all elements of s are associated with the written cycle or œÉ does not have fixed points
 Since the starting point for each new cycle can be chosen in different ways, there are usually many different cycle notations for the same permutation; For example, the one above has an example œÉ kaa har chakra apane aap main ek kramparivartan kaa pratik he, arthath jo is kaksha main œÉ ke sam mulya letaa he, s ke sabhi tatwon ko swany main chitrit karte hue
 kaksha ke l aakaar ko chakra kii lambaai kaha jaataa he
 The discrete orbitals of œÉ are by definition relaxed, so the corresponding cycles are transformed and œÉ is the product of its cycles
 Hence the combination of cycles in cycle notation can be interpreted as marking the structure of the permutation, which is why the permutation is named "decomposition"
 This decomposition is essentially unique: other than the reorder of cycles in the product, there is no way to write œÉ as the product of cycles whose orbitals are relaxed
 The cycle notation is less unique because each cycle can be written in different ways, as in the example above where it represents the cycle but will represent a different permutation)
 aakaar 1 kii ek kaksha kaa tadnurupi chakra nahin he, chunki yah kramparivartan x or saath hi s ke har anya tatv ko thik karegaa, duusare shabdon main yah pahchaan hogi, x se swatantra rup main
 yah sambhav he chakra ankan main shaamil karen taaki œÉ bal de ki œÉ x ko tay karata he, par yah œÉ ke apghaton main kaarak ke anuroop nahin he
 If the concept of "cycle" includes the identification of permutations, it will destroy the uniqueness of the decomposition of permutations into loose cycles
 The decomposition of the identity permutation into loose cycles is the empty product; Its cycle notation will be empty, so a marking method like e will be used instead
 lambaai ke do chakron ko pratisthaapan kaha jaataa he; aise kramparivartan keval do tatwon kii jagah badalte hai
 The product of two permutations is defined as their structure as a function, in other words œÉ ¬∑ œÄ is the function that depicts any x element of the set in œÉ)
 dhyaan den ki kaary kaa anuprayog likhane ke dhang kii vajah se sabase daayan kramparivartan pehle tark par lagu hota he
 Some authors prefer to apply the leftmost factor first, but for that the permutation must be written to the right of their argument, for example as the exponent, œÉ x œÉ is applied to x; So the product is defined by x œÉ ¬∑ œÄ = œÄ
 While this gives a different rule for multiplying permutations; This article uses the definition where the rightmost permutation is first applied
 chunki do dvibhajanon kii sanrachana hameshaa ek or dvibhajan detii he, do kramparivartan kaa utpaada phir se ek kramparivartan he
 The work structure is collaborative, so the product operation on the permutation is: ¬∑ œÅ = œÉ ¬∑
 So the products of the permutation are usually written without parentheses and they are also usually written without a dot or other mark marking the product
 pahchaan kramparivartan, jo set ke prayek tatv ko swany main hi chitrit karata he, is utpaada kaa tatasth tatv he
 In two-line notation, the identity is chunki dvibhajan ke vyutkram hai, isliye kramparivartan ke bhi hai or œÉ kaa vyutkram œÉ ‚àí1he jo phir se ek kramparivartan he
 Clearly, whenever œÉ = y is also œÉ ‚àí1 = x of one
 do panktiyon vaale ankan main vyutkram do linon ko paraspar badal kar praapt kiya ja saktaa he udhaaharan ke liye By reversing the order of the elements in each cycle in cycle notation, one can obtain cycle notation for its inverse
 ek sahyogaatmak utpaada, ek tatasth tatv or iske sabhi tatwon ke liye vyutkram se s ke sabhi kramparivartan ke set kaa samooh banaata he jise s kaa samametiya samooh kaha jaataa he
 Each permutation of a finite set can be expressed as the product of the substitution

 sabhi kramparivartan sam yaa visham rup main vargeekrut hai, kisi bhi abhivyakti main unke pratisthaapan kii samta ke anusaar
 The method of multiplying permutations written in cycle notation is difficult and the product cycles can be completely different from the permutations being structured
 haalanki chakra sanrachana sangrakshit he œÉ ke kramparivartan ke anya kramparivartan œÄ ke sanyugma ke vishesh maamle main, jiskaa arth he utpaada œÄ¬∑œÉ¬∑œÄ ‚àí1 kaa nirmaan

 The permutation of {1, 2, 


, {0} n} can be represented as an n √ó n matrix

 a permutation of a set s with n elements in combinatorics is a list of elements of s in a sequence
 ise set se s main aupchaarik dvibhajan ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Note that if s is equal to, this definition matches the definition of group theory
 aamtaur par ke bajaae tatwon ke kram se susajjit kisi bhi set kaa istemaal kar sakate hai
 The property of combinatorics that is related to the group theoretical interpretation of permutations and which can be defined without using the total order of s is the cycle structure of the permutation œÉ
 yah n ke chakron kii lambaai kaa varnan karte hue œÉ kaa vibhaajan he
 Here for every fixed point of œÉ there is part "1" in the division
 ek kramparivartan jiskaa koi nishchit bindu nahin he use avyavashtha kaha jaataa he
 The properties of other combinatorics are directly related to the order of s and the way the permutation is related to it
 There are many such qualities
 n ke œÉ ke kramparivartan kaa aaroh i œÉ i +1, isliye 1 ‚â§ i { \ displaystyle 1 \ leq i} ke saath prayek i yaa to œÉ kaa aaroh he yaa avaroh
 The number of permutations of n with k mount is the Eulerian number ‚ü®nk‚ü© { \ displaystyle \ textstyle \ left \ langle {n \ atop k} \ right \ rangle}, also the number of permutations of n with k mount
 ek kramparivartan kaarohi ran us kramparivartan kaa bharaa hua vriddhimaan samipsth anukram he jise donon ore se badhaayaa ja saktaa he, yah kramik arohi ke adhiktam anukram ke anuroop he 
 For example, the ascending runs of the permutations 2453167 are 245, 3 and 167, while it has an incremental result of 2367
 agar ek kramparivartan ke k ‚àí 1 avarohi ran hai, to yah k arohi ran kaa sangh hona chahie
 isliye n kaa kramparivartan k arohi ran ke saath vahi he jo k ‚àí 1 arohi ke saath kramparivartan kii sankhya ‚ü® n k ‚àí 1 ‚ü© { \ displaystyle \ textstyle \ left \ langle {n \ atop k-1} \ right \ rangle } kaa he
 a permutation is a pair of inverse positions of œÉ in which the entries of the permutation are in the reverse order: i { \ displaystyle i} and œÉ i> œÉ j { \ displaystyle \ sigma _ {i}> \ sigma _ {j}}
 So a descending is just an inverse at two adjacent positions
 udhaaharan ke liye, kramparivartan œÉ = 23154 ke teen vyutkram hai:,, , pravishtiyon ke jode, , ke liye
 Sometimes an inverse is defined as a pair of values whose order is reversed, it does not make any difference to the number of inversions and this addition is also the inverse of the œÉ ‚àí1 inverse permutation in the above sense
 vyutkram kii sankhya degree ke liye ek mahatvapurn upaay he jiske liye kramparivartan kii pravishtiyaan kram se baahar hai, œÉ or œÉ ‚àí1 ke liye vahi he
 To arrange a permutation with k inverse, it is always possible to apply adjacent substitutions sequentially and require a k sequence of such operations

 The number of permutations of n with k inverse is expressed by the Mahonian number, this is the coefficient of x k in the product expansion

 In this section, the k-permutation of the set s is a systematic sequence of specific elements of S

 Representation of the permutation of n 0 ‚â§ n <n! With n can be done by integers, provided that convenient methods are provided for the commutation between the number and the normal representation of the permutation as a sequence

 For the permutation œÉ in the Lehmer code, the number dn represents the choice made for the first term œÉ 1, the number dn ‚àí1 represents the choice made between the remaining n - 1 elements of the set for the second term œÉ 1 and Similarly even further
 And frankly, each dn + 1 ‚àí i gives the number of remaining elements which is definitely less than the term œÉ i
 chunki ve shesh tatv kisi pasch pad œÉ j ke rup main aane ke liye baadhya hai, ank d n +1‚àíi vyutkramon kii ginati i ko chote suchakank ke rup main shaamil karke karata he

 The Lehmer code lists the number of crosses in successive rows, while the inverse table lists the number of crosses in successive columns; Is the Lehmer code for the inverse permutation and the inverse permutation for the Lehmer code
 lehmar code d n, d n ‚àí1, 


, d 2, d 1 ko ek vyavasthit s set ke kramparivartan main prabhavi rup se parivartit karne ke liye, vardhman kram main s ke tatwon kii suchi ke saath shuru kar sakate hai or i ke liye 1 se n set œÉ i se soochibaddh tatwon se badhayen jisamen anya d n +1‚àíi pehle ghatit hon or us tatv ko suchi se nikaal den

 Successive changes in the factorial number system of successive natural numbers generate these sequences in lexical order, and converting them to further permutations preserves radix order provided that the interpretation of the Lehmer code is used to represent the number in the factorial number system
 The sum gives the number of inversions of the permutation and the sum of the equations is Permutation get the marker
 iske atirikt vyutkram talika main shunya kii sthiti kramparivartan kii baayen-se-daaen mahattam kaa mulya detii he jabaki lehmar code main shunya kii sthiti daaen-se-baayen laghutam kii sthiti he ; isse sabhi kramparivartanon main aise antim ke vitaran kii computing hoti he

 The most useful method of doing this depends on whether some, randomly chosen, permutation, or all permutations are expected, and in the latter case if a specific order is required
 ek or prashn he ki kya die gaye anukram main pravishtiyon ke bich sambhavya samanta ko dhyaan main rakhaa janaa he; agar aisa he to anukram ke vishisht multiset kramparivartan hi utpann kiye jane chahie
 An obvious way to generate permutations of n is to generate values for Lehmer code and convert them into homogeneous permutations
 However, the latter step, although obvious, is difficult to implement efficiently because it requires n operations and deletions of each selection in a sequence to be a direct representation of a sequence, at a random position, as a table or a serialized list; The change requires approximately n 2 / 4 operations for both

 For this reason it does not seem useful, although it is certainly possible, to employ a special data structure that can convert o time to Lehmer code permutation
 die gaye n mulyon ke anukram ke yadrichhik kramparivartan paidaa karne ke liye isse koi antar nahin padataa ki kram par n kaa yadrichhik rup se chunaa gaya anukram lagu kiya jaae yaa kram ke vishisht kramparivartanon main se ek yadrichhik tatv kaa chunaav kiya jaae

 Unlike the streamlined production which n! Due to the evolution of the number becomes impractical for large n, there is no reason to assume that n will be small for random production

 For the latter analogy, the sequence can be interpreted as the Lehmer code and derives from the method of production that Ronald A

 This can be solved by using a different bifurcation analogy: from the remaining i elements of the sequence, after using di instead of selecting the element, instead of removing the element and moving the elements one place, making the sequence narrower
 Replaces the last remaining element
 is prakaar chayan ke liye shesh tatv samay main prayek bindu par ek kramagat range banaate hai, bhale hi ve usee kram main nahin hote jaise ki ve mul anukram main the
 The mapping of permutations from a sequence of integers is somewhat complex, but it can be seen to generate each permutation in exactly one way by instantiation
 jab chaynit tatv antim shesh tatv ho, pratisthaapan sankriya ko choda ja saktaa he
 It is not so often that the test of conditions is justified, but the final element must be included in the selection of candidates to guarantee that all permutations can be generated

, a ke yadrichhik kramparivartan ke utpaadan ke liye parinami kalan ganit ko nimna chhadmasanket main varnit kiya ja saktaa he: There are several methods for the systematic production of all permutations of a given sequence; Knuth has devoted enough sections to this discussion in an upcoming edition of The Art of Computer Programming
 a classical calculus math, which is both simple and flexible, is based on finding new permutations in lexicographic order, if it exists
 yah mulyon ke doharaav ko sambhaal saktaa he, jiske liye yah har baar pruthak multiset kramparivartan utpann karata he
 It is also more efficient for simple permutation than generating values in Lehmer code in lexicographic order
 ise upyog karne ke liye, vardhaman kram main anukram kii chantai shuru karte hai or phir agle kramparivartan ke milane tak doharaate rahete hai
 This method started with Pandit Narayan in 14th century India and has been continuously developing ever since

 This changes the location of the given permutation

 Step 2 finds the smallest value a to replace a and by changing them in step 3 the sequence after k is attained in a decreasing decreasing order

 Many scientific calculators have built-in procedures for calculating the number of k-permutations of n
 kramparivartan kaa kaary aksar menu ke kai staron ke madhyam se uplabdh hota he; kaary kaa upyog kaise kiya jaae yah aamtaur par calculatoron ke sahaayak dastavezon main diya jaataa he
 In most spreadsheet software, the function of calculating k-permutations of n is implicit

 Permutations are used in interlever components in error detection and correction of algorithm arithmetic such as turbo code, eg 3GPP Long Term Evolution Mobile Telecommunications Standard uses these ideas
 Such applications allow for quick production of permutations with desirable properties
