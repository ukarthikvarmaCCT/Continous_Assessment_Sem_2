vanaspativigyaan tathaa puraatatv kaa gaharaa gyaan tha
 He was the first scientist to work on the optics of radio and micro waves
 vanaspati vigyaan main unhonen kai mahatvapurn khojein kii
 He was also the first scientific researcher of India
 ve bharat ke pehle vaigyanik the jinhone ek american patent praapt kiya
 He is considered the father of radio science
 ve vigyankathaayen bhi likhte the or unhen bengali vigyankatha-sahitya kaa pita bhi mana jaataa he
 Born in the British province of Bengal, Basu graduated from St
 Xavier's College, Calcutta
 ye phir landan vishvavidhyalay main chikitsa kii shiksha lene gaye, lekin swasthya kii samasyaon ke chalate inhen yah shiksha bich main hi chhod kar bharat vaapis aana padaa
 He then took the position of Professor of Physics in the Presidency College and did many important scientific experiments even while facing caste discrimination
 inhone betaar ke sanket bhejne main asaadhaaran pragati kii or sabase pehle radio sandeshon ko pakadaney ke liye ardhchalkon kaa prayog karnaa shuru kiya
 But instead of profiting commercially from his discoveries, he published them publicly so that other researchers could work on them further
 iske baad inhone vanaspati jeevaidya main anek khojein kii
 He invented a machine crescograph and studied the response of plants to various stimulants
 is tarah se inhone siddh kiya ki vanaspatiyon or pashuon ke utakon main kaaphi samanta he
 They were very against the patent process and they applied for a patent only on the advice of friends
 haal ke varshon main aadhunik vigyaan ko mili inke yogadanon ko phir manyata di ja rahi he
 Basu was born on 30 November 1858 in Memansingh, Faridpur in Dhaka district, Bengal
 unke pita bhagwaan chandra basu brahm samaaj ke netaa the or faridpur, bardhaman evam anya jagahon par up-magistrate yaa sahaayak kamishnar the
 His family came from Rarikhal village, Bikrampur, nowadays in Munshiganj district of Bangladesh
 gyaarah varsh kii aayu tak inhone gaanv ke hi ek vidhyalay main shiksha grahan kii
 Basu's education started in a Bengali school
 unke pita maanate the ki angreji seekhney se pehle apni maatrubhaasha achche se aani chahie
 Addressing a conference in Vikrampur in 1915, Basu said- "at that time sending children to English schools was considered a sign of status
 main jis bangla vidhyalay main bheja gaya vahaan par mere daayin taraf mere pita ke muslim parichaarak kaa betaa baitha karata tha or meri bain ore ek machuaare kaa betaa
 He was also my sports partner
 unki pakshiyon, jaanwaron or jalajeevon kii kahaniyon ko main kaan laga kar sunata tha
 Perhaps these stories aroused a keen interest in my brain to research the structure of nature
 " vidyalayan shiksha ke baad ve kalakatta aa gayi or saint jevier skool main pravesh liya
 Jagdish Chandra Bose had a great interest in biology and moved to London at the age of 22 to study medical science
 magar swasth kharaab rahane kii vajah se inhone chikitsak banane kaa vichaar tyagkar cambridge ke christ mahavidhyalay chale gayi or vahaan bhautikee ke ek vikhyath pro fadar lafont ne bose ko bhautikashastra ke adhyayan ke liye prerit kiya
 In the year 1885, he returned home and started teaching in Presidency College as Assistant Professor of Physics
 yahaan vah 1915 tak rahe
 At that time, Indian teachers were paid one third of the salary of British teachers
 iskaa jagadish chandra bose ne virodh kiya or bina vetan ke teen varshon tak kaam karte rahe, jisaki vajah se unki stithi kharaab ho gai or un par kaaphi karja ho gaya tha
 To repay this debt, he also had to sell his ancestral land
 chauthe varsh jagadish chandra bose kii jeet hui or unhen puraa vetan diya gaya
 Bose was also a good teacher who used large scale scientific demonstrations to teach in the classroom
 bose ke hi kuch chaatr jaise satendra nath bose aage chalakar prasiddh bhautikashastri bane
 British theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves of mathematically diverse wavelengths, but he died in 1879 before his prediction was validated
 british bhautikavid oliver loj maxwell tarangon ke astitv kaa pradarshan 1887-88 main taron ke saath unhen preshit karke kiya
 German physicist Heinrich Hertz experimented with the existence of electromagnetic waves in free space in 1888
 iske baad, loj ne hertz kaa kaam jari rakhaa or june 1894 main ek smaraneey vyaakhyaan diya or use pustak ke rup main prakashit kiya
 Lodge's work attracted the attention of scientists from various countries, including Bose of India
 bose ke microwave anusandhan kaa pehali ullekhneey pahalu yah tha ki unhone tarang dairdhya ko millimetre str par laa diya 
 They understood the loss of long wavelength light waves to study the properties of light
 1893 main, nicola testla ne pehle saarvajanik radio sanchaar kaa pradarshan kiya
 a year later, during a November 1894 public demonstration in Kolkata, Bose used a millimeter range microwave wave to fire ammunition and ring a bell
 leftinent governor sar wiliam maikenji ne kalakatta toun haul main bose kaa pradarshan dekha
 Bose wrote in a Bengali essay, 'invisible Light', "invisible light can easily pass through brick walls, buildings etc
, so the message can be transmitted through light without wires
 " rus main popov ne aisa hi ek prayog kiya
 Bose's first scientific article "on the polarization of electric rays by double refractory crystals" was sent to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in May 1895, within a year of the Lodge article
 unka doosraa lekh oktober 1895 main landan kii royal socity ko lard rele dwaara bheja gaya
 In December 1895, the London magazine electrician published Bose's article "on a new electro-polariscope"
 us samay angreji bolne vaali duniya main loj dwaara gadhe gaye shabd 'kohirar' k prayog hertz ke tarang resiver yaa detector ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 The electrician immediately commented on Bose's 'coherer'
 
 angreji patrika electrician se uddhrut tippanee he: Bose planned to better his "coherer" but never thought about the patent
 bose ne apane prayog us samay kiye the jab radio ek sampark madhyam ke taur par viksit ho rahaa tha
 Bose's work on radio microwave optics was not related to radio communication, but the improvements he made and the facts he wrote about it influenced other radio inventors
 us daur main 1894 ke ant main guglielmo marconi ek radio system par kaam kar rahe the jo wireles telegraphy ke liye vishith rup dizine kiya ja rahaa tha
 By early 1896, the system was transmitting radio signals far beyond the range indicated by physics
 jagadishchandra bose pehle vaigyanik the jinhone radio tarange detect karne ke liye semiconductor jankshan kaa istemaal kya tha or is paddati main kai microwave components kii khoj kii thi
 After this, there was no research on electromagnetic waves of millimeter length for the next 50 years
 1897 main bose ne landan ke royal institushan main apane millimetre tarango par kiye hue shodh kii varnana di thi
 He used waveguides, horn antennas, die -lectric lenses, different polarizers and semiconductors with frequencies up to 60 ghz - in his research
 yah saare upkaran aaj bhi kolkata ke bose institute main maujuud hai
 a 1
3 mm multibeam receiver housed in Arizona's NRAO 12 meter telescope is built on the principles of the research paper written in 1897 by Acharya Bose
 sar neville mott ko 1977 main solid state electronics main kiye apane shodhakarya ke liye nobel puraskaar mila tha
 He had said that Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose was 60 years ahead of his time
 asal main bose ne hi p - tip or n - tip semiconductor ke astitv kaa purvanumaan kiya tha
 His biggest contribution in the field of biophysics was that he showed that the stimulation of plants is transmitted through the electrical medium and not through the chemical medium
 baad main in daavon ko vaigyanik proyogo ke madhyam se sach sabit kiya gaya tha
 Acharya Bose first studied the effect of microwave on vegetative tissue
 unhone paudhon par badalte hue mausam se hone vaale asar kaa adhyayan kiya tha
 Along with this, he also studied the effect of chemical inhibitors on plants and the effect of plants on changing temperatures
 alag alag paristhitiyon main cell membrane potential ke badlaav kaa vishleshan karke ve is nattejey par pahunche kii paudhe samvedansheel hote hai ve " dard mahasoos kar sakate hai, sneh anubhav kar sakate hai ityadi "
 Bose did a comparative study of fat response on different metal and plant tissues
 unhone alag alag dhaatuo ko electrical, maikenical, rasinic or thermal tareekon ke mishran se uttejit kiya tha or koshikao or dhaatu kii pratikriya ke samaantaaon ko note kiya tha
 Bose's experiments showed a cyclic fatig reaction in simulated cells and metals
 iske saath hi jivit koshikao or dhaatuo main alag alag tarah ke uttejnaaon ke liye vishesh chakree fatig or recovery rispance kaa bhi adhyayan kiya tha
 Acharya Bose made a graph of the electrical response of changing plants with the changing electrical stimuli, and also showed that when the plants were given poison or anesthetic, their reactions started to work and became zero later
 lekin yah pratikriya zinc dhaatu ne nahin dikhaai jab use oksalik acid ke saath treet kiya gaya
 In 1917 Jagdish Chandra Bose was conferred the title of "knight" and was soon elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London for Physical and Biology
 bose ne apana puraa shodhakarya bina kisi achche upkaran or prayogshaala ke kiya tha isaliye jagadish chandra bose ek acchhee prayogshaala banane kii soch rahe the
 "bose Institute" is the result of this thinking, which is a famous center of the nation for research in science

 Shunhashep is a legend located in Aitareya Brahmin
 iskaa saransh yah he ki jab tak mrityu saamne na aaye tab tak roopaantaran nahin hota
 This narrative is a tale of human greed, dishonesty and the ability to rise above it
 raja harishchandra apni sau raniyon ke baavjood nissantan tha
 He worshiped the God of Varuna, that if i have a son, i will dedicate the first son to you
 use ek putr kii prapti ho gai, jiskaa naam rohit rakhaa gaya
 But as soon as the king saw the son in a hurry, his intentions were damaged
 vah kisi na kisi bahaane rohit ko varun devtaa ko saunpane kii baat taalata rahaa
 Fearing that the father would not actually offer him to Varun Dev, Rohit ran into the forest and Harishchandra did not fulfill his vow, so Varun cursed him and became ill
 bhagyavash jangal main idhar-udhar ghoomte rohit ko ajigart naamak stri ek garib brahman ke paas le ai
 Rohit told his story to him
 ajigart ke teen bete the - shun:puchh, shun:langool or shun:shape
 Shun: Shep was a middle son and was very intelligent and intelligent since childhood
 ajigart ne laalach main aakar rohit se kaha ki sau gaayon ke badale vah apane ek putr ko bechney ko taiyaar he
 He can save his life by handing over that son to the god Varuna instead
 duusari ore shun:shape ne sochaa, chota bhai maa kaa laadla he, bada bhai pita kaa laadla he, yadi main chalaa jaaun to donon main se kisi ko koi afsos nahin hoga
 So he agreed to go with Rohit himself
 varun dev bhi koi kam lobhi nahin the
 They were happy to think that i am getting a Brahmin boy for my ritual instead of a Kshatriya boy who is superior
 yajna main nar bali kii taiyaari shuru hui, chaar purohiton ko bulaayaa gaya
 Now Shun: Shep had to be tied to the sacrificial pillar
 lekin iske liye un chaaron main se koi taiyaar nahin hua, kyonki shun:shape brahman tha
 Then in exchange for Azigart and hundred cows, he agreed to tie his child to the Yajna pillar
 iske baad shun:shape ko bali dene kii baari ai
 But the priests again refused
 brahman kii hatya koun kare? tab ajigart or ek sau gaayon ke badale apane bete ko kaatane ke liye bhi taiyaar ho gaya
 When Shun: Shep saw that there was no one to save me now, he started the eulogy of Usha Devta
 prayek richa ke saath shun:shape kaa ek-ek bandhan tuutata gaya or antim richa ke saath na keval shun:shape mukt ho gaya, balki raja harishchand bhi shraap mukt ho gaye
 With this, the child became Shun: Shep, the sage Shun: Shape, because it was a moment of transformation for him
 kuch or vidwano ke anusaar shun:shape kushiko ke kul me utapann mahaan tapasvi vishwamitra va vishwamitra ke shatru sambar kii putree ugr kii khoi huyi santaan tha jise bharto ke dar se lopamudra ne ajitgart ke paas chipa diya tha
 Bharato kills Furious
 bhartiya samskruti main paidaa hue kisi bhi manushya kaa man yavat jivan trividh eshnaon se baddh – subaddh – rahata he
 This is an undeniable reality
 ye teen eshnaon kaa naam he – 1
 putraishna, 2
 vittaishna or 3
 lokaishna
 Out of these three, the distraction is related to the practical life of man-life
 or jo lokaishna he, vah purvamimasaa-prokt yajyayagadi se praapt honevaale swarglok aadi maranottar lok se sambandh rakhti he
 But the daughter-in-law, it is the irrefutable seed of eternal and universal desire to remain forever on the earthly realm of mankind
 or aisi putraishna main putr evam putree donon abhisht he – yah baat taarkik rup se nihit he
 But due to the natural limitations of feminine, man's importance has increased in the society due to being stronger than male and female, and in the world, male dominance has been shaped
 atah manushyamaatr ke man main putraishna jadibhoot ho gai he
 Therefore, the story of Shunshashep in Aitreyabrahman becomes an extremely guide to the masses of daughters-in-law
 
 However, the story of Shunha Sheep is seen from a different perspective
 jaise ki – vedakaal main narmedh yag hote the yaa nahin
 In the Shunashekayana, when it comes to sacrificing a human being to Varunadevata, scholars around the world have made a point of discussion about whether humans were sacrificed in the Vedic yajna-yagadi along with animal sacrifice
 - parantu is aakhyaan main antatogatva koi bhi manushya kaa bali to nahin chadhaaya jaataa he
 Due to this, there is an urgent need for reconsideration
 is shunamshepakhyaan ke prarambh main raja harishchandraji ne naarad ko poocha he ki – gyani evam agyani donon prakaar ke log apane oras putr kii kaamana karte he
 So tell me why you should wish for a son? Giving a solution to this curiosity, Naradji said that the son is also a form of light in the Supreme Vyom
 duusari or, is aakhyaan ke ant main kaha gaya he ki kisi bhi raja ke rajbhishek ke prasang main yah aakhyaan kaa paath karnaa chaiye, evam jisko bhi putr kii kaamana ho in logon ko bhi is aakhyaan kaa shravan karnaa chaiye
 Keeping in view this undertaking and epilogue of Shunha Sheep story, if seen, the story of three sons and three fathers is presented in this story
 jaisaa ki – pratham pita kii baat aisi haih- ikshvakuvansh ke raja harishchandr ko so so patniyaan hote huye bhi ve aputra the
 But behind these hundred-odd marriages, there must have been betrothal as a driving force
 naarad ne putr ke hone se jo jo laabh milte he, usko vistaar se bataaya he
 Hearing him, Harishchandra begs the son from Varun Devata at any cost
 putr ek baar paidaa ho jaay or vah uskaa mukhadarshan karle to vah kritakruty ho jaayegaa
 And after that he is also ready to sacrifice the son to Varun
 harishchandr ko is shart par putr mil gaya
 From the narrative of the narrative presented here, it is known that the malevolence in the human being, it drowns the man in blind faith
 devataaon ko balidaan de kar putr praapt kiya jaataa he – aisa maananaa ek agyaan he
 On the second level, it is seen that after the attainment of son, father Harishchandra also becomes Mohandh and repeatedly stutters with the promise of sacrificing Varuna
 varunadev jab bhi bali maangane ke liye aate he tab ve ek ke baad ek bahaanaa dikhalaate huye apane putr kii bali dene kaa taalte rahete hai
 The second father is Azigart, son of Suyyavas
 vah bechaara bhukh se peedit he
 He also has a wife and three sons as dependents
 bhukh ke asaadhaaran evam aprihaary sankat main funs kar bhi vah apane kisi bhi putr ko bajhaar main bech de vah uchit nahin he
 Therefore, if he beaks himself as the family of the family, then he will be considered right
 parantu “ sabhi ko apni hi aatma sab se adhik priy hoti he ”- is krur satya ko dhyaan main liya jaay or phir sochaa jaay to shaayad teen main se ek putr ko bech dene kii baat kadachit sahya ban sakegi
 In the same way, the age-old weakness of the parents is also of Kubul that the father is loved by the eldest son and the mother is loved by the junior
 to bechaara ‘ tapasvi ’ madhyamputra aisi visham paristhiti main nishchit hi bali kaa bakra ban jaataa he
 In this way, the aggrieved father, Azigart, by taking cows from King Harishchandra, and selling a son in exchange for him, might - yes, perhaps - be reluctantly judged judicial
 kintu vahi pita apane putr ko yagyeey pashu ke rup main, harishchandr kii yajyashala main baandhane ko taiyaar ho jaay or aise adham krity ke liye duusari so gaayen maang le to vah lobhivriti kaa parinaam hi kaha jaayegaa
 Narrator Mahidas Aitareya has also described the climax of greed
 yup ke saath putr shunagashep ko baandhane ke baad pita ajigart apane paapakarm se virat nahin hota he
 Yajna will not be complete unless one slaughter in the sacrifice as a sacrifice
 gaanv main se koi bhi chandal aakar ek manushya kaa vadh karne ko taiyaar nahin he
 So Shunshape's father Azigart Lobhavashat is ready for this sin
 usne teesri so gaayon ko maang kar le lee
 And ruthlessly rises with a drawn sword to kill his own son
 - yah chitra ek laalchee pita kii nirghrinata ko udghaatit karata he
 In philosophies which have been counted as Shad Ripu - Kama, Krodh, Mad, Moh, Greed and Matsar - successive Ripu among them is considered to be strong
 arthath pahele kamadi chaar ripuon se paanchava lobh naamak ripu adhik balvan he
 From this point of view, the second type of father has not only disturbed the patriarchy by being tempted
 parantu maanavmaryada kaa bhi atikaraman karke paapmarg par sudur tak nikal gaya he
 The third father is the sage Vishwamitra, who had one son each
 unke hotrutv main shunagashep kaa yajna main bali dena nishchit hua tha
 He has seen Shunha Shape as a sacrificial animal, tied in a pathetic condition before him
 unki dayaneey manoyatnaa evam nihsahaayta bhi pratipal dekhi he
 And in a critical situation, patiently following the path of worship of the gods, trying to get rid of the death loop by becoming their own savior, they have observed closely
 prajapati, agni, savita, varun, vishwedeva, asvins, indra or ushaa – sabhi vaidic devataaon ko shunagashep apane mantrabal se kramshah pratyaksh karata jaataa he
 Also talks to them
 aisa sachcha vidyavan brahmanputra kis rishi ko pasand nahin aayegaa ? Rishi Vishwamitra considered such Shunsha Shep to be his inheritance - knowledge
 And in his heart Mana Shunhashep accepted him as his son
 vishwamitra ek pita ke rup main gungnata vyakti the
 He called his first fifty sons and asked Shunha Shep to accept him as the first brother-in-law
 parantu un putron ne pitru-ajna nahin maani
 Therefore, Vishwamitra declared those fifty to be 'ineligible'
 ve rishi-sampatti ke daay bhaag se vanchit ho gayi
 After this, who was the twenty-first son named Madhuchanda and all his followers, he considered Shun Shashep as his eldest brother
 phir vishwamitra rishi ne shunagashep ko “ devraat ” namase uddhoshit kiya
 People with sonship should want to become virtuous fathers like Pehle Vishwamitra
 vishwamitra ne apane shatadhik putron kii apeksha se shreshth putr ke rup main is mantradrashtaa shunagashep ko hi pasand kiya he or usko apane putr ke rup main bhi sweekaar liya he – yah baat bady suchak he
 If such a son was found, then only what Narada had said that - "son, there is light in the Supreme Vyom," - that can be a matter, otherwise not
 is aakhyaan main raja harishchandr, daridr ajigart evam rishi vishwamitra jaise teen pitaaon kii tulana kerani aavashyak banati he, vaise hi teen prakaar ke putron kii bhi tulana karne yogya he
 As - Rohit, the son of King Harishchandra is the first
 vah apane pita ke prastaav kaa virodh karata he or pitru-ajna ko thukraa kar, praanon kii raksha karne ke liye grihatyag karke van main vicharan karne lagata he
 After this, the father has a disease called ascites - after hearing this, inspired by the patriarchy, he decides to return home
 parantu maarg main indradev mil gayi, uske kehane main aa jaataa he or vah baar baar dusron ke kehane main aakar van main waapas laut jaataa he
 The result of the sermon that Indra preached with these words is that during Harishchandra's son Rohit, one of his poor sons, Ajigart, wandering in search of food, found three sons together
 rohit ne raajputr hone ke kaaran, rajalakshmi ke jor par, arthath baap-kamai ke jor par, daridr vyakti ke ek deen-hin putr ko kharid kar apane saath main le kar rajmahal main waapas aata he
 Prince Rohit has kept in mind that by sacrificing this poor-brahmanaputra, he will free the father from Varuna's loop and he will also get rid of himself
 - yahan par indra ke kahene main aakar baar baar van-vicharan karte rahete rohit kaa, pahele ek anirnaayak manobalavaale putr ke rup main parichay miltaa he or baad main, swaarthee tathaa baap-kamai kaa ashrayan lenevaale raajputr ke rup main parichay miltaa he
 In the world, this is the first type of son
 
 The second type of son in the world is the 50 sons of sage Vishwamitra
 ve vishwamitra jaise mantradrashtaa pita kii bhi ajna maanate nahin he
 These sons, disregarding the wisdom of the father, lost their paternal heritage and were also cursed
 parinamtah ve samaaj main dasyuon jaisaa jivan jeene lagate he
 The son of twenty-one Madhuchanda and his 50 brothers-in-law obeyed the father
 vishwamitra kii drushti main vishwaas karanevaale in putron ne shunagashep ko apane jyeshtha bhrata ke rup main sweekaar kar liya
 
 tisare prakaar kaa jo putr sadaiv spruhaniya hota he, vah he shunagashep
 After reading the entire narrative, it seems that he was an aphrodisiac, but was a son of continuous learning
 kyonki varun ke pash se mukt hone ke liye jo mantra rugveda ke chaturth mandal or pancham mandal main aaye huye he in sab ko vah acchhee tarah se jaanata tha
 Along with that, he himself is also the seer of many mantras stored in the First Circle
 at ev vah rishi vishwamitra kii drushti main spruhaniya putr ban jaataa he
 Vishwamitra had 101 and sons of his own
 kintu unako shunagashep jaisaa mantra-drashtaa putr na hone kaa afsos tha
 Therefore, he summons his auspices and orders Shunashape to accept him as the eldest brother
 unki drushti main shunagashep jaisaa putr hi sangrahya evam spruhaniya he
 Vishwamitra has seen during the entire yagya kriya that Shunha Shape is a devrat in the true sense
 agni, varun, indra, asvins, vishwedeva evam ushaa ityadi devataayen hi unki sampatti – raati – the or usee ke bal upar usne apni mukti haansil kii he
 Here, because of Shunahshep learning - Vyasangi knows so much mantra or can see new mantra - it is not enough to say that
 usne to apane pita kaa paap bhi unke munh par kah diya he
 That is, Shunahshep can also see the truth, and by standing in front of the father, he can also tell
 vahi uski mahanata he
 The person speaking such truth frees Varuna from the loop and not the other
 kyonki varun to neetimatta kaa evam rut kaa paalak dev kaha gaya he
 Therefore, he frees Satyaniti's seer Shaunshape from bondage
 aisa satyavaktaa putr hi pitaaon ke liye param vyom main jyoti swaroop ban saktaa he
 And only such a son should be wished for
 arthath putraishna bhi vivekadrushti se niyantrit honi chaiye
 In this way, after the recapitulation of the recitation, the epilogue of this narrative is also immediately understood - 1
 Why is there any information to recite this narrative in the consecration of any king? rajya kaa vaaris praapt karne ke liye andhshraddha-grast hona anuchit he
 2
 However, even those wishing for a son should recite this narrative - this is what is said in the epilogue to understand the three types of sons aforesaid
 
 It is also necessary to state incidentally here that in view of the epilogue of this narrative - "was the sacrifice offered in the Vedas or not?" "churches like this have been happening all over the world till today, but that discussion is going on in misguided direction - it is believed
 ab prastut abhinav drushti se dekha jaay to putraishna se peedit is sansar ko shunagashep kaa sandesh yahi he ki stribhrun-hatya se virat hone kaa avasar aa gaya he
 No daughter takes Matapita to hell and all the sons cannot become the true light carrying the Supreme Ether
 
 Blue Mahadanva stars are those Mahadanava stars which are 'O' or 'B' category stars
 inamen aam taur par 10 se 50 saura dravyaman kaa dravyaman hota he or inkaa ardhavyas 25 saura ardhavyas tak ho saktaa he
 These are the hottest and brightest stars of the universe and are found only in small numbers
 nile mahadaanav laal mahadaanvon se chote akar ke hote hai
 Because they have a very short lifespan, they are found only in young celestial groups, such as in the arms of spiral galaxies, in clumsy galaxies, and in open galaxies
 It is rarely seen in the centers of spiral galaxies, oval galaxies, and round galaxies, because the structures are prepared only after a very long period of construction, and the blue supergiant is consumed for that long
 nile mahadaanav kaa ek bada mashhuur udahaaran shikari taramandal main sthit rijal he jisamen suraj se 20 guna dravyaman or 60,000 guna chamak he
 The number of blue supergiant may be small, but their brightness is such that many can be seen from the earth without binoculars
 bahut bade aakaar ke taare aksar apni mrityu ke qareeb aakar nile mahadaanav ban jate hai
 Nuclear reactions in such stars slow down and the star shrinks
 iskaa nateeja yah hota he ke ab ek pehle se kai choti akar kii sataha se pehle ke lagbhag baraabar urja nikal rahi hoti he jis se us sataha kaa taapmaana bahut bad jaataa he
 The same happens with the red supergiant whose nuclear reactions slow down
 laal mahadaanvon se har samay ek ghani gas kii aandhi nikalati rahati he jo apane ghaneypan kii vajah se bahut dhimi raftaar rakhti he
 In contrast, a less dense but very strong thunderstorm emanates from the blue supergiant
 jab koi laal mahadaanav nila mahadaanav banataa he to nile mahadaanav kii tej andhi puraane laal mahadaanav kii dhimi aandhi se ja takaraati he or ek gas kaa jamaavada taare ke ird-gird ek maheen gole ke rup main ban jaataa he
 Almost all the blue Mahadanavas have been seen around such circles, which is proof that all of them were once red Mahadanavas

 Kanhopatra was a 15th-century Marathi saint-poetess
 hindu dharm ke varkari sampradaay dwaara sammanit thi
 According to the most traditional, Kanhopatra was a prostitute and a dancing girl
 vah varkari dharm ko maanati thi
 He elected to surrender to the Hindu god Vithoba-deity patron without disdain from the concubine of the emperor of Bidar
 vah pangarpur main vithoba ke mukhya mandir main nidhan ho gaya
 Only one person is within the premises of whose samadhi temple
 kanhopatra marathi ovi or abhanga apane peshey ke saath uskaa sheel santulan ke liye vithoba ke prati uski bhakthi or uske sangharsh kii kavita kah likhi thi
 In his poems, Lord Vithoba became his protector and prayed to release him from the clutches of his profession
 uski tees abhanga aaj bhi batch gaya he or aaj bhi loga gaate he
 He is the only female saint Varkari, who has attained purity without the Guru only on the basis of his devotion
 kanhopatra ke itihaas sadiyon se madhyam se log jaanate he ki unke kahaniyon neeche paarit kar diya gaya he or unke kahaniyon me tathy or kalpana karne ke liye mushkil bana gayi he
 People believe about his birth by shaming him and his Moth Vithoba temple when the king of Bidar wanted him
 haalanki, sadashiv malguzar or hausa naukaraani ke paatro unki charitraaon main nahin dikhaai dete he
 Kanhopatra was the daughter of Shama, a wealthy prostitute, who lived in Mangalveda Shehar of Pandharpur
 kanhopatra ke alaava mangalved santon varkari chokhamela or damaaji kaa bhi shamaa kanhopatra ke pita kii pahchaan ke bare main anishchit tha, lekin yah andeh tha ki shahar ke sir main sadashiv malguzar janmasthan he
 Kanhopatra spent her childhood in her mother's palatial house and was served by many maids
 kanhopatra kii saamaajik sthiti bahut hi kam tha
 Kanhopatra was trained in dance and song from childhood so that she could join her mother's profession
 vah ek pratibhashali nartki or gayak ban gaye
 Her beauty Apsara was compared to Maneka
 shamaa ne kanhopatra ko sujhaaye gaya ki badshaah ko milanaa he, tab jo uski sundarataa or uphaar use paise or gahane puja hogi lekin kanhopatr saaf inkaar kar diya
 Kanhapatra's mother Shama thought of getting Kanhopatra married
 vidwaan tara bhawalkaar kaha gaya he ki kanhopatra kii shaadi ke liye manaa kiya gaya tha kyon ki vah ek daasi ki bethi he
 Kanhopatra did not have hope in the life of a prostitute but had stubbornly stalked her and other people say that she was strongly forbidden to become a prostitute
 kuch lekhakon kaa maananaa he ki ho saktaa he ki vah bhi ek veshya ke rup main kaam kiya he
 Sadashiv Malgujar, the father expected Kanhopatra, heard about Kanhopatra's beauty and wished to see her dance, but refused Kanhopatra
 tadnusaar, sadashiv kanhopatra or shamaa ko pareshaan karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Shama explained to him that he was Kanhopatra's father and thus tried to abandon them, but Sadashiva did not believe him
 vah apane utpeedan jari rakhaa, shamaa ke dhan dhire-dhire samaapt ho gaya
 Eventually, Shama apologizes to Sadashiva and offers to present Kanhopatra to her
 kanhopatra, tathaapi, ek naukaraani ke rup main prachhann uski vruddh naukaraani hausa kii madad se pangarpur ke liye bhaag gaye
 In some legends, Hausa is credited for traveling to Kanhopatra to perform a Varkari devotional as described
 anya khaaton varkari tirthayatriyon jo pangarpur main vithoba mandir ke liye apane raste par kanhopatra ke ghar se paarit credit diya
 According to one story, for example, he asked a Gujara Varkari about Vithoba
 varkari kaha ki vithoba ", udaar budhimaan, sundar or sahi" he, uski mahima kaa varnan se pare he or uski sundarataa se badhkar lakshmi, saundarya kii devi kaa he
 Kanhopatra further asked whether Vithoba would accept him as a devotee and Varkari said that he would accept Kanhopatra
 is aashwaasan,pangarpur jane ke liye uske sankalp ko majboot banaaya
 Kanhopatra immediately leaves Vandoba-ki bhajan Pandharpur-sing with Varkari pilgrims or Pandharpur was a caste with him explaining to his mother
 jab kanhopatra ne pahali bar pangarpur kii vithoba chhavi ko dekha he,tab unhone abhangaon ko gane ke liye shuru kar diya
 She sang in an abhanga that she had fulfilled her spiritual qualifications and was blessed to have seen Vithoba's feet
 vah adwitiya saundarya vah vithoba main uske duulhe kii maang main paaya tha
 He considered himself "married" to God and settled in Pandharpur
 vah samaaj se waapas le liya
 Kanhopatra was taken to a cottage in Pandharpur along with Hausa and lived the life of an ascetic
 vah vithoba mandir main gaaya or nrity kiya tha, or yah ek din main do baar saaf kiya thi
 She gained in relation to the people, and people believed that she was a farmer
 is avadhi par, kanhopatra vithoba ke liye samarpit ovi kavitaaon kii rachana kii
 Sadashiva sought help from the emperor on this period
 kanhopatra kii sundarataa ke kisse sunakar badshaah uski rakhel banane ke liye use aadesh diya
 When he refused, the king sent his men to get her by force
 kanhopatra vithoba mandir main sharan lee
 The king's soldiers surrounded the temple and threatened not to destroy it if Kanhopatra was handed over to them
 kanhopatra le jaaya ja rahaa se pehle vithoba ke saath ek pichhali baithak kaa anurodh kiya
 By all Isab, Kanhopatra died at the foot of Vithoba Chitra, but the circumstances were not clear
 lokapriy parampara ke anusaar, kanhopatra shaadi-kuch kanhopatra ke liye intazaar ke ek farm main vithoba kii chhavi ke saath vilay kar diya
 Other theories suggest that he killed himself, or that he was killed for his autocracy
 adhikansh
 Isab says Kanhopatra's body was laid at the feet of Vithoba and then buried near the southern part of the temple
 puranic katha ke sabhi sanskarnon ke anusaar, ek tarati ped-jo uske tirthayatriyon dwaara puja kii jaati he kii maukey par hi samaran-uthi jahaan kanhopatra dafnaaya gaya tha
 Kanhopatra is the only person whose samadhi is in the premises of Vithoba temple
 kai itihaaskaaron kanhopatra ke jivan or mrityu kii tithi ko sthapit karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 One estimate gives him his life from about 1428 CE from the Bahamani of Bidar, a king who is often associated with the Kanhopatra story though in most accounts, that king is never explicitly named
 pavaar kaa anumaan he ki vah 1480 main mrityu ho gai thi
 Others suggest dates of 1448, 1468 or 1470, or simply that he lived in the 15th century or, in rare cases, the 13th or 16th century
 jelliot ke anusaar, vah sant-kaviyon chokhamela or namdeva ke samakaleen the
 Kanhopatra is believed to have composed many abhangas, but most were not in writing: only thirty or ovis of him survive today
 sakal sant-gaatha kaha jaataa taees uski kavitaaon ke chand varkari santon ke sankalan main shaamil kiye gaye hai
 Most of these songs are autobiographical, written with an element of compassion
 uski style, kavy upkarnon ke dwaara sade samajhane main aasaan ke rup main varnit he, or abhivyakti kii ek saadagi ke saath kiya jaataa he
 According to Deshpande, the rise of Kanhopatra's poetry and female creative expression reflects the "awakening of Dalits" ignited by the spirit of gender equality enforced by the Varkari tradition
 kanhopatra ke abhanga aksar apane peshey or vithoba ke prati uski bhakthi varkari ke sangrakshak devtaa ke bich uske sangharsh ko chitrit he
 He presents himself as a woman deeply devoted to Vithoba, and begs her to save him from the unbearable bonds of her profession
 kanhopatra uskaa apmaan or samaaj se uske nirvaasan apane peshey or saamaajik kad ke kaaran ke bolti he
 In Nako, Devaraya Anta Aata is believed to be the last unhappiness of her life-incapable to bear the thought of her separation from God, Kanhopatra also gives birth to Vithoba to end her suffering
 kanhopatra aupchaarik rup se santon kii suchi main shaamil kiya gaya he, paath bhaktivijay main marathi main santon arth diya gaya he

 At that time, Safavi was very happy to find Nadir Shah in his decadent empire
 ek taraf se osmani samrajya to duusari taraf se afagaanon ke vidroh ne safaviyon kii naak main dam kar rakhaa tha
 Apart from this, the Russian Empire was also eyeing from the north

 After this the practice started - chakra, array of composition and horse riding etc 

 Nadir himself practiced on horse for three hours

 Until now, Nadir's expeditions were confined to northern, central and eastern Iran and adjoining Afghanistan
 usne osmanion ko pashchim se maar bhagaaya or uske turant baad vah purab main heraat kii taraf badha jahaan par usne heraat par niyantran kar liya
 His military success was not seen from Tehmashp
 use takhtapalat kaa dar hone laga
 He resumed the war with the Osman with the aim of proving his military worthiness, which ended up embarrassing him and he had to return some of the territories Usman had won
 nadir jab heraat se lautaa to yah dekhakar kshubdh hua
 He sought his support from the public
 isi samay usne isiahaan main ek din tahmaashp ko nashe kii haalat main ye samajhaayaa ki wo shashan ke liye ayogy he or uske ye ishaare par darbariyon ne tahmaashp ke nanhen bete abbaas ko gaddi par bitha diya
 At the time of his coronation, Nadir announced that he would defeat the rulers of Kandahar, Delhi, Bukhara and Istanbul
 darbar main upasthit logon ko laga ki yah charam atmapravanchanaa ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 But in time to come, he came to know that it was not so

 But he was defeated in his first attack
 osmanon ne baghdad kii raksha ke liye ek baari sena bhej di jiskaa nadir koi jabaab nahin de paaya

 The Safawis were Shia and under them the Shia people got rid of the atrocities of the Arabs
 aaj iran kii janata shiya he or vahaan shuruaati teen khalifaaon ko gaali dene kii parampara he
 Nadir Shah, while holding his throne, placed a condition that people would give up this disrespect towards those Caliphs
 isse use faaydaa bhi mila
 Shia Sunni tension in Iran not only decreased but at the same time Iran was seen as another center of Islam
 nadir armeniyon ke saath bhi udaar dharmik sambandh rakhata tha
 His rule was a time of peace for the Jews as well
 apane samrajya ke andar usne sunni mazahab ko janata par ladane kii koi koshish nahin ki lekin samrajya ke baahar wo sunni parivartit rajya ke shah ke rup main janaa jane laga
 It began to be compared to the Osmani empire, which was the Surveyor of Islam at that time

 After being satisfied in the direction of the west, Nadir Shah shifted his focus towards the east
 sainya kharch kaa bhaar janata par padaa
 He took control of Kandahar
 is baat kaa bahaanaa bana kar ki mughalon ne afagaan bhagodon ko sharan de rakhi he usne mughal samrajya kii ore kooch kiya
 After capturing Kabul, he invaded Delhi
 karnal main mughal raja mohammad shah or nadir kii sena ke bich ladaai hui
 In this, Nadir's army was smaller than the Mughals, but the Persian army won because of its landmines
 uske march 1739 main dilli pahunchne par yah afawaah faili ki nadir shah maaraa gaya
 This caused a stampede in Delhi and the Persian army was killed
 usne iskaa badla lene ke liye dilli main bhayanak khoonkhraba kiya or ek din main koi 20,000 - 22,000 log maar die
 Apart from this, he also took a lot of money from Shah
 mohammad shah ne sindhu nadi ke pashchim kii sari bhoomi bhi nadir shah ko daan main de di
 He was also presented with a volley of diamond jewels which included Cohenoor, dariya-noor and taj-e-mah, each with their own bloody story
 nadir ko jo smapda mili wo kareeb 70 karod rupayon kii thi
 This amount was comparable to the erstwhile Seven Year War in which the French government gave the Austrian government
 nadir ne dilli main samrajya vistaar kaa lakshya nahin rakhaa
 His aim was to collect the necessary funds for his army which he got
 kaha jaataa he ki dilli se lautne par uske paas itnaa dhan ho gaya tha ki agle teen varshon tak usne janata se kar nahin liya tha
 On his return from Delhi, he learns that his son Raza Quli, whom he had made as the voicerai in his absence, has killed Safavi Shah Tahamashap and Abbas
 isse usko bhanak mili ki raza uske kilaaf bhi shadyantra rach rahaa he
 With this fear, he removed Raza from the Viceroy
 iske baad wo turkestan ke abhiyaan par gaya or uske baad dagestan ke vidroh ko daman karne niklaa
 But he did not get success here
 lezgon ne khandak yuddh niti apanaai or rashad ke kaaravaan par akraman kar nadir ko pareshaan kar daalaa
 While he was in Dagestan, Nadir received the news that Raza was planning to kill him
 isse wo kshubdh hua or usne raza ko andhaa kar diya
 Raza said that she is innocent but Nadir did not listen to her
 lekin kuch hi din baad nadir ko apni galati par khed hua
 By this time Nadir had fallen ill and was very upset to blind his son
 nadir shah ne aadesh diya ki un saradaaron ke sir uda die jaayen jinhone uske bete raza quli kii ankhen phodi jate dekha he
 Nadir Shah blamed the chieftains for why none of them said that his eyes should be blown instead of Raza Quli
 dagestan kii asafalataa bhi use khaae ja rahi thi
 Gradually he became more tyrannical
 usne dagestan se khaali haath waapas lautne ke baad usne apni sena ek bahut puraane lakshya ke liye phir se sangathit kii - pashchim kaa osmani samrajya
 At that time when the army was organized it was counted as 3,75,000 soldiers
 itani badi sena us samay shaayad hi kisi samrajya ke paas ho
 Iran's own army has never been so big before the Iran - Iraq war of 1980 - 1988
 san 1743 main usne osmani samrajya iraq par hamalaa kiya
 He did not face much opposition except in cities
 kirkuk par uskaa adhikaar ho gaya lekin baghdad or basra main use safalataa nahin mili
 His ambition came to an end in Mosul and he had to compromise with Osman
 nadir ko ye samaj main aayaa ki osmani uske niyantran main nahin aa sakate
 New Usmani troops were sent against him
 nadir shah ke bete nasirullah ne inamen se ek ko haraaya jabaki nadir ne yerawan ke nikat 1745 main ek duusare jatthe ko haraaya
 But this was his last big victory
 isamen osmanon ne use nazaf par shashan kaa adhikaar diya
 Nadir's end was beset by his illnesses
 vah dinanudin biimaar, atyaachaari or kattar ho chalaa tha
 In his last days he imposed heavy taxes on the public and even started demanding money from his close relatives
 uskaa sainya kharch kaafii bad gaya tha
 His nephew, Ali Quli, refused to obey his orders
 19 june 1747 main mashhad ke nikat uske apane hi angrakshakon ne uski hatya kar daali
 Nadir Shah's achievements could not last long
 uske marane ke baad ali quli ne swayan ko shah ghoshit kar diya
 He named his name Adil Shah
 nadir ke marane ke baad sena teetar bitar ho gai or samrajya ko kshatrapon ne swatantra rup se shashan karnaa shuru kar diya
 European influence also increased
 nadir ko europe main ek vijeta ke rup main khyaati mili thi
 In 1768, Christian VII of Denmark ordered Sir William Jones to translate his biography written by Persian historian Mirza Mahdi Astarabadali into Persian from French
 1739 main uski bharat vijay ke baad angrezon ko mughalon kii kamazori kaa pataa chalaa or unhone bharat main samrajya vistaar ko ek mauka samaj kar damakham lagaakar koshish kii
 If Nadir Shah did not invade India, the British might not even think of taking possession of India in this way or challenge Indian rule on such a large scale

 shrinivas kii samajashastreey drushti ghatnaon kii bahari banaavat ko bhed kar unhen gadhane vaali sanrachanaon or aitihaasik shaktiyon kii thaah leti he
 His ability to present the nuanced details and insights of community life in simple language gives him a distinct personality from contemporary sociologists
 is arth main ve vishaygat shabdaawalee kaa atikaraman karte hue saadhaaran or prachlit bhashaa ko chunate hai
 It will be called the democracies of his scholarship that his theoretical concepts help in understanding the subject rather than engaging in his own ideas
 shrinivas ne vicharadhara ke str par bhartiya samajashaastra ke liye ek nayi zamin taiyaar kii
 It is worth mentioning that at the time when Srinivas was preparing to study Indian society, American and British academic installations dominated social sciences
 america vishvavidhyalayon main prachlit drushtikon bhartiya upmahadweep ke samaaj ko samajhane ke liye sanskritnishtha paramparaon par jor detaa tha
 As a result, Indian sociologists considered Sanskrit sources and Indology / Indology to be more authentic for the study of contemporary reality
 shrinivas pehle samajashastri the jinhone is varchasvkaari sthiti ko chunauti di
 He proved from his writings that in sociology, the study of the actual activities and activities of society is better than relying on classical references
 shrinivas dwaara prastut prabhutvshaalee jati tathaa samskruthikaran kii avadharanaon kaa raajnneeti vigyaniyon ke alaava itihaas-lekhan kii sabaltern jaisi dhaaraon ke itihaaskaaron ne vyapak prayog kiya gaya he
 In this sense, his work can be placed in the category of an intellectual tradition which has acquired the status of an important reference for new and old scholars
 prasangvash, prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana sankhya bal, bhu-swaamitv, shiksha or naukari jaise karkon ke kaaran kisi jati ke gaanv yaa kshetra vishesh main dabadabe ko jaahir karti he to samskruthikaran nimna jatiyon dwaara ucch jatiyon khaas taur par brahman varg kii samskruti, reeti-rivaazon, bhashaa or veshbhusha aadi ko apnaane kii pravriti ko gyaapit karti he
 Though his third concept vote bank could not make a permanent place in social sciences, the term is used indiscriminately in the daily discourse of politics and media world
 swatantra bharat kii raajnneetik or saamaajik sanrachana ke adhyayan main ye teenon avadharanaayen or usase jude vimarsh tattvik mahatva hasil kar chuke hai
 The concepts of dominant caste and culturalization help in understanding the decisive elements of India's social system and its organizational structure
 haalaanki brahmnavaadi aadarshon kii ghatati vaidhata ke kaaran samskruthikaran kii avadharana ab utani mahatvapurn nahin maani jaati lekin yah tathy he ki beesvin sadi ke ek bade kalkhand or swatantraaa ke baad bhi lambe samay tak samskruthikaran ek kaasi ullekhneey pravriti thi
 In the politics that emerged after the Dalit movement and the Mandal Commission, the trend of Sanskritisation has weakened, but the concept of dominant caste is still seen as an essential tool in analyzing the political processes in rural society in India
 kai samakaleen samajashastri shrinivas ke krititv ko rashtravaadi samajashaastra ke brihattar sandarbh main rakhkar aankane kaa aagrah karte rahe hai
 He says that the urban elite of independent India wanted to continue the project of modernization of colonial rule
 isliye rashtravaadi samajashastriyon ke krititv main chintan or vichaar kii vahi aupniveshik saraniyan sakriy thi jinke aadhaar par british satta apane shashan ko vaid tehraati aayi thi
 These scholars say that the work of sociologists like Srinivas focused on caste and community provides a benchmark for understanding of an all-india Sanskritist Hinduism
 lekin shrinivas kii drushti ko prakat yaa aprakat taur par british yaa america maanavshaastra kii sthapanaaon se nirdeshit bataanaa jaldbaaji kii daleel he jo subooton kii kami ke baavjood aarope patr taiyaar karne kii himakat karti he
 This argument fails to target the tendency of Srinivasa's work in which Srinivas studies the community and also considers the duality of the community and its relations
 shrinivas samajashaastra or maanavshaastra kii buniyadi prasthaapanaaon par bhi thik isi tarah vichaar karte hai
 It is worth noting that Srinivas defines himself as a fellow scholar, as a fellow scholar, whose identity is not different from his subject ie people
 shrinivas jin logon yaa samudaay kaa adhyayan karte the unhen ve anya kii shrenee main nahin rakhte the
 In this regard, many British anthropologists have believed that anthropologists studying their society face different kinds of difficulties
 unke anusaar viksit desh kaa maanavshastri ek deshaj maanavshastri ko uski nimnatar sthiti kii ore ishaara karke hameshaa ek khaas saanche main kaid rakhana chahta he
 Srinivas, while clarifying the position of the indigenous anthropologist on this issue, wrote that when an Indian anthropologist studies any caste or other group of India, that caste or group is other for him but at the same time does not ignore this
 It should be done that certain cultural forms, beliefs and values of that caste or group also match the said scholar
 yani aisi sthiti main bhartiya maanavshastri asal main ek tarah se anya main swa kaa bhi adhyayan karata he
 In this sense, that caste or group is not completely unfamiliar to him or her as both are connected to the same culture
 shrinivas is sthiti ko asaamaanya dhang se jatil, bahuparti or dwaidhapurna maanate hai
 Looking carefully, Srinivas does not seem to be accused of being a nationalist sociologist given the points of difference and equality with his subject
 vastav main shrinivas is baat par jor dete hai ki adhyayan main aatm or anya kii yah bahulata maanavshastri ke apane samudaay kaa sadsy hone yaa bahari hone kii ekalata se kahin zyaada shreyaskar he
 It is noteworthy that he uses many observations from the Chicago School to study the caste system of the village of Rampura, which was chosen by Srinivas for his research studies
 varna kii prak-british avadharana ko shrinivas kitaabi nazariyaa siddh karte hue yah kehete hai ki yah drushti jati ke gatisheel pakshon ko gaun kar detii he
 Although Srinivas's caste-study focused on the local structure of a village, he was also conscious of the pan-india prevalence of this phenomenon
 apane ek lekh main ve is tathy kii ore ishaara karte hai ki jati nihsandeh ek akhil bhartiya sanrachana he, kyonki desh main har jagah aise samooh dekhe ja sakate hai jo paitrukataa tathaa vaivaahik sambandhon ke aadhaar par ek vishisht samooh kaa nirmaan karte hai
 Srinivas also cites traditional employment of these groups in this regard
 unka yah bhi kahana he ki desh main har jagah brahman, achhut, kisaan, dastkaar, vyapaaree or dusron kii seva karne vaali jatiyon kaa astitv dekha ja saktaa he
 In this caste study, Srinivas also mentions regional variations and factors such as western education, administrative jobs, city income, which have had a major impact on the caste structure
 is tarah deergh avadhi ke lihaaj se dekhen to ek samajashastri ke taur par shrinivas ne bhartiya gram or jati kii sanrachana ko aupniveshik dharanaon ke saidhantik varchasv se bhi mukt karaayaa he
 At the same time, he also countered the beliefs of sociologists like Dumon who were proposing that caste differences do not allow the Indian village to become a community
 shrinivas jab gramin samudaay kii sankalpana or gaanvon kii aarthik-saanskrithik antar-nirbharta kii baat karte hai to ve avyakt dhang se akhil bhartiya sabhyataa kii baat bhi karte hai
 Some scholars believe that Srinivas has adopted a Brahminical or upper caste point of view in the study of caste
 lekin is daleel ko sahi kone se dekhen to vah darasal aupniveshik samajashaastra se nikali prathit hoti he
 Srinivas's logic-plan actually exposes the macro and under-concerned perceptions of Western sociologists regarding India's rural communities
 sankshep main kaha jaae to shrinivas kaa krititv pashchimi gyanshastreey prasthaapanaaon, swa, samudaay tathaa raashtra kii dharanaon ke aalochakeey vimarsh main kai buniyadi tark muhaiyaa karaata he

 puraatatv paryaton Archaeological tourism is a form of cultural tourism, which promotes interest in public archeology and the preservation of historical sites
 puddatatv paryaton puratathvik sthalon kaa daura karne, sangrahalayon, vyakhya kendron, aitihaasik ghatnaon kii rinecometat, or swadeshi utpaadon, tyoharon, yaa theatre kaa punraishkaar sahit saarvajanik puratathvik sanvardhan ke saath jude sabhi utpaadon, shaamil kar sakate hai
 Archaeological sites and historical places are major tourist attractions worldwide
 pichley kuch varshon main, aitihaasik sthalon kaa daura karne tisare sthaan par he - videsh yatra ke americanyon dwaara kiye gaye kaaryon ke bich - restaraan or shopping main bhojan ke baad
 The number of people that visit archaeological sites increases year by year and increased traffic can result in damage to sites
 charam maamalon main, citon aage kii kshati ko rokane ke liye janata ke liye band kar diya gaya he
 Archaeological tourism follows a fine line between aggressively becoming tourism, promoting archaeological sites and the cultural heritage of a region and the more damage it can do to them
 puratatvavidon paryaton dekh rahe hai or ateet jaanane kaa vishesh tareeke ko protsaahit karti he ki chintaa vyakt kii he
 When archaeological sites can become a priority, tourism boards are run by ticket fees and souvenir revenue, and the question remains whether a site is worth opening or closing to the public and keeping the site out of harm's way
 apurnty puratathvik karne ke liye nuksaan saamagree keval avshesh avyavasthit hai, jab badal diya, nasht kar diya, yaa lut liya ke rup main, pratyaksh nahin he, lekin aksar is tarah ke hotel, restaraan, sadakon, or dukaanon ke rup main paryaton suvidhaon kii kharaab niojit vikaas kaa apratyaksh parinaam
 These fairly ancient structures can flood, produce landslides, or weaken in ways that alter the environment
 puraatatv paryaton logon ke hit ke aitihaasik or puratathvik sthanon ke liye yatra jisase prakriya ko darshata he
 The reason why it is called archaeological tourism is due to the fact that often visiting places such as pyramids in Egypt and artifacts dating back to ancient times have been discovered where archaeological sites are arranged 
 puraatatv paryaton paryatakon ke pracheen sthalon ke bare main apni jigyaasa ko santusht karne ke liye yaa yah chaatro or vidwaanon ho saktaa he, jo paryatakon ko shikshit karne ke uddeshy ke liye ho saktaa he ke liye ek saadhan ho saktaa he
 Most often, these antiquities are located to promote archaeological tourism as a means of educating people about their rich cultural heritage, where the region's government is, or simply as a means for tourists visiting
 To make some money from
 paryaton kuch arthvyavasthaaon apane astitv ke liye us par mukhya rup se nirbhar kar rahe hai ki is tarah ke ek bada vyapaar he
 For this reason, some governments may promote their culture and encourage archaeological tourism as a means to earn more money
 paryatakon ko vimaan kiraaya, parivahan, bhojan, awaas, sevaaon or kalakritiyon kii kharid par paise kharch karte hai
 The government also benefits from taxes levied on expenditure by such tourists
 ek puratathvik paryaton gantavy kalakritiyon vaastavik utkhanan sthalon khud ke liye rakhe jate hai jahaan sangrahalayon se lekar byaaj kii kuch bhi ho saktaa he
 Occasionally archaeological tours may now exist that include other related features, such as recreation of historical sites or simulating more modern sites, to look like some culturally relevant ones
 udhaaharan ke liye, simulation lag rahi hogi pracheen kaal se ek shahar kii tarah lag rahaa he ki ek bhoot shahar kii tarah kuch shaamil ho sakate hai
 One of the drawbacks of archaeological tourism is the danger of landing at these places which can be put in front of truly historic sites by the rush of tourists
 isse bhi sakht pratibandh he, hameshaa sambhawatah aitihaasik sthalon kii paristines prabhavit karne vaale aise sthanon ko nuksaan ke kuch farm kaa khatra nahin he
 Tourists visiting caves with ancient paintings on the walls, for example, the frequent traffic of humans can lead to erosion of the place's properly protected status
 yah puratathvik paryaton yah paryaton vyapaar se paane he rajasav kii aitihaasik mulya main kami ke liye ek acha samjhauta he, to yah tay karnaa hoga ki jagah le ja rahaa he, jahaan is kshetra kii sarkaar he That popularity of archaeological sites as tourist attractions means that they are valuable sources of revenue, but unfortunately this time it is reinstated by tourists in proper management to ensure both conservation of the site and continued enjoyment
 do not conform
