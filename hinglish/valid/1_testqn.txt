 is prakaar vah italy ke swadhinata ke sangharsh kaa agradoot bana rahaa
 The French Revolution of 1848 also had an impact on Italy
 atah deshbhakton ne swatantraaa praapt karne kaa prayaas kiya
 He was not successful in this endeavor, but due to the fall of Metternich, his enthusiasm is due to Mezzini for perfecting Italy's ideal of national integration
 uskaa janm 1805 i
 main geneva main hua tha
 He was greatly influenced by the Kingdom of France
 jiskaa shrey uske doctor pita ko jaataa he
 He kept studying inspirational literature after getting inspiration from his father, so he became a foster of revolutionary ideas from childhood
 padhai samaapt karne ke baad vah carbonary kaa sadsy ban gaya
 Due to liberal views he was arrested in 1830 AD
 lagbhag ek varsh tak vah senona kii jail main kaid rahaa

 He blamed Austria for this
 atah usne uske khilaaf sangathit hokar uskaa saamana karne kii aavashyaktaa pratipaadit kii
 In this way, Mezzini, with his ideas, encouraged the people of Italy for national integration and filled them with a sense of patriotism and sacrifice
 vah swayan ganatantr kaa samarthak tha tathaa anya logon ko bhi vah swatantraaa kaa paath padhaata tha
 Thus he remained the forerunner of Italy's struggle for independence

 He played an important role in the unification of Italy

 Kavoor was his worthy Prime Minister
 rashtriya maamalon main donon ke bich uchit talmail bana rahaa or donon ke vaanchit sahyog se rashtriya-ekikaran kaa kaary gati praapt karata rahaa
 Therefore, it would not be exaggerated to say that if Victor Emanuel had not been there, the task of unification of Italy would have been difficult if not impossible
 dekhen, chemil benso kavur The person who contributed most to the unification of Italy was named Count Camille de Cabour
 vah apane yug kaa ek mahatvapurn or kushal kootneetijna tha
 He was born in 1810 in a landlord family in Turin
 usne apana jivan ek sainik ke rup main aarambh kiya, par baad main usne uskaa parityag kar diya
 He was a supporter of legitimate state power and was influenced by the parliamentary system of England
 uskaa prabhaav desh main dhire-dhire badhata gaya
 In 1848, he became a member of the country's parliament
 apni yogyata ke bal par vah 1852 i
 main peedmant kaa pradhanmantri ban gaya
 As soon as he became Prime Minister, he paid special attention to the progress of the podium
 vah vyaavhaarik or drudh nishchayi vyakti tha
 He made it possible to unify Italy by acting according to the circumstances
 caboor kii yah manyata thi ki jab tak rajya majboot nahin hoga, tab tak vah apane sangharshon main safal nahin ho sakegaa
 Therefore, first of all, he tried to make the pedometer stronger by giving him the leadership of integration
 rajya ko sudrudh banane kii drushti se usne anek sudhaaron ko kriyanvit kiya
 Special efforts were made by him for the development of trade and business
 usne vyapaar ke kshetra main ‘‘khulaa chhod do’’ kii niti kaa anusaran karte hue vyavsaay ko rajkeey sangrakshan pradaan kiya
 Under his guidance, the development of means of transport was strengthened and the field of agriculture was developed
 shiksha kii unnati kii ore bhi vishesh dhyaan diya gaya
 He also implemented new reforms in the field of military and law
 bank sambandhi niyamon main anukool sudhaar kiye gayi
 In this way, he reformed all the organs of administration and made the administration of the state dynamic and strong
 uske in prayaason ke kaaran peedmant rajya kii bahumukhi unnati hui or ab vah ek shashakt rajya ban gaya
 After strengthening his foundation, he tried to get support from all classes of people
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki mejini or gariboldi jaise netaa usase sahyog karne ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 Thus he was successful in getting the support of majority of the people in the work of national integration
 caboor ek samajhadaar or vyavhaarik vyakti tha
 He realized that foreign aid was necessary to achieve his goal
 saubhaahgya kii baat thi ki vah apane is uddeshy main bhi safal hua
 He was keen to end Austria's influence in Italy, because without it he could not achieve his objectives
 vah bhaleebhanti samaj gaya tha ki austria ke khilaaf yadi koi europea rajya tatparta se sahyog pradaan kar saktaa he, to vah france he
 Therefore, he tried to please France
 iske liye usne kreemia ke yuddh main france kii sahaayta kii
 This war was fought in 1854 AD with the question of Eastern problem
 isaki samaapti 1856 i
 main paris kii sandhi dwaara hui
 Cabour also attended the conference to discuss the Treaty of Paris
 vah us sammelan main italian swadhinata ke daawey ko kushaltapurvak prastut karne main safal hua
 He advocated ending Italy's influence by blaming Austria for the pathetic state of the country
 uske dwaara die gaye tarkon se france kaa tatkaaleen raashtrapati nepolian tritiy prabhavit hua or usne italy ko sainik madad dena sweekaar kiya, aisa karne main uskaa apana nijee raajnneetik laabh tha
 He considered it necessary to be a participant in this work with a view to impressing the French people with its importance
 falswaroop june 1858 i
 main donon ke bich plambiars naamak sthaan par ek samjhauta hua, jo is prakaar tha- France will provide military aid to Italy to take Austria out of Italy's control, and in return for this aid Italy will give France the territory of Nice and service
 is prakaar videsh sahaayta praapt karne kii samasya kaa bhi samaadhaan ho gaya
 Now Cabour agreed to wage war against Austria
 france kii sahaayta kaa aashwaasan paakar caboor austria ke khilaaf yuddh karne ke liye tatpar tha
 Hence, at the behest of Cabur, there was a rebellion against Austria in Lombardy and Venetia
 vidroh kii sthiti ko dekhte hue austria yuddh kii anivaaryta ko samaj gaya
 As a result, in 1859 AD, war started on both sides
 yuddh jari hi tha ki achaanak france ne apane kaa yuddh se alag kar liya
 The reason for this was the willingness of Prussia to assist Austria in the war and to be expensive
 saath hi, nepolian ne yah anubhav kiya ki italy kaa sangathit hona france ke prati uchit na tha
 In such a situation, the Treaty of Zurich was signed between Italy and Austria, whose terms were as follows - is sandhi se italy santusht nahin hua, kyonkivenesia kaa austria ke adheen rahanaa use khal rahaa tha, phir bhi lombardi kii prapti ekikaran kii disha main ek badi uplabdhi thi, haalanki madhya or dakshin main ekikaran kaa kaary abhishesh tha
 The demand for independence was also increasing in the states of central-italy
 ye rajya bhi ab peedmant ke saath milane kaa prayaas karne lage the
 In 1860, the states of Modena, Parma and Tuscany, etc
, decided to meet in the piedmont by public opinion
 is prakaar madhya-italy ke rajyon kaa bhi ekikaran ho gaya
 Now only the states of south-italy remained to be organized
 shesh italy ko peedmant main shaamil karne kaa jo andolan chalaa usamen kisi videsh shakti kaa sahyog nahin liya gaya
 This was its own example of Italian nationality, headed by Gariboldi
 dakshin-italy ke pramukh rajya the - sicily or neples, jahaan burvo-vansh kii satta vidyaman thi
 See, Juzape Garibaldi gariboldi ne italy ke rashtriya-ekikaran ke kaary main mahatvapurn yogadan diya
 He was born in 1807 AD in Nice
 usne nau-sena kii shiksha praapt thi
 He was involved with maritime trade
 vah mejini se bada prabhavit tha, isiilie vah republican-dal kaa pakshpaati ho gaya tha
 The government was displeased with this liberal idea, so he was arrested
 sajaa se bachane ke liye vah dakshin-america bhaag gaya
 After living there for many years, he returned to Italy again in 1848 AD
 kranti main asafalataa praapt karne ke pashchaat vah punah america chalaa gaya
 He returned to Italy after earning a lot of money from there
 caboor or victor amenual ke saath usne sampark banaaye rakhaa
 Under his leadership, he organized the Lalkurti team, with which he succeeded in freeing Sisley and Naples and connecting them with the national stream
 in rajyon ko rashtriya dhara main jodne kaa kaary gariboldi ne kiya
 Sicily and Naples were two kingdoms in south-italy, where the Burvo-dynasty ruled
 yahan kii janata ne vidyaman shashan ke khilaaf vidroh kar diya or gariboldi se sahyog kii prarthana kii
 In response, Gariboldi, with the help of his army, took control of all Sicily by June 1860
 yah kaary saralata se sampann ho gaya
 Sicily is now incorporated into the kingdom of Piedmont
 iske pashchaat usne 1860 i
 main neples par bhi apana adhikaar kar liya
 On 6 September 1860, Francis II, ruler of Sicily and Naples, fled the country
 in donon kaaryon kaa sampadan usne desh-prem or rashtriyata kii bhaavana se prabhavit hokar kiya
 This is a unique example of his love and sacrifice for the nation
 1862 i
 main uskaa dehanth ho gaya
 At the parliament meeting on 18 February 1861 AD, Victor Emanuel was accepted as the ruler of Italy
 is uplabdhi ke baad 6 june 1861 i
 ko kaabur kii mrityu ho gayi
 Cabour is credited with making Italy a nation, with the cooperation of Mezzini, Garraboldi and Victor Emanuel
 caboor kii yah ichha thi ki rome sanyukt italy kii rajdhani bane, par vah abhi italy main shaamil nahin ho paaya tha
 In addition, Venezia was still under Austrian authority
 is prakaar italy ke ekikaran ke kaary main ye do kamiyaan abhishesh thim
 The task of unification of the German states was going on under the leadership of the Prime Minister of Prasha
 is kaary kii purnataa ke liye prasha ne 1866 i
 main austria ke khilaaf yuddh kar diya, jisamen italy bhi prasha kii ore se shaamil hua
 Prasha eventually succeeded in this war
 is sahyog ke lievenesia kaa rajya italy ko praapt ho gaya
 In October 1866, it was merged into the piedmont
 rome kaa pracheen vaibhav italysiyon ke liye gaurav kaaran tha
 They wanted to make him the capital of the new Italy state, but he still had the authority of the Pope
 1870 i
 main france or prasha ke bich yuddh chhid gaya
 In such a situation, France had to withdraw its army based in Rome
 germany ke ekikaran ke daur main yah yuddh sidan ke maidan main ladaa gaya, jisamen antim safalataa prasha ko mili
 This situation gave Italy a favorable opportunity to invade Rome, taking advantage of which she invaded Rome
 20 sitambar 1870 i
 ko italy ke senapati cadoni ne rome par italy kaa adhikaar sthapit kar liya
 Thus, this last wish of the Italian people was also fulfilled
 2 june 1871 i

 Inaugurating the Parliament of Italy, he said, is prakaar italy ke ekikaran kaa mahan kaary puraa ho sakaa

 Other identifiers such as RFID tags, UPC codes, international characters in email addresses and host names, and a variety of other identifiers can potentially use DNS
 domen naam pranali is databes seva kii kaaryakshmata ke takneekee aadhaar bhi paribhaashit karti he
 For this purpose, it defines a detailed description of the data structures and communication exchanges used in DNS as part of the Internet Protocol Suite

 DNS was invented in 1983, shortly after TCP / IP
 puraane system main, network par SRI par sthit prayek computer se ek computer HOSTS
TXT naamak fil praapt karata tha
 The names found in the HOSTS
TXT file contained a numeric address

 Systems based on host files have some basic limitations, as it is an obvious requirement that whenever a computer's IP address changes, computers that try to contact it will also need to be updated from its host file
 netwarking ke vikaas ko or adhik vishwasaneey pranali kii aavashyaktaa thi jo host main pate ke badlaav ko keval ek jagah par record kare

 At the request of John Postel, Paul Mocapetris invented the first domain name system in 1983 and wrote how to implement it
 The original interpretation is shown in RFC 882 and RFC 883 which were replaced in November 1987 with RFC 1034 and RFC 1035
 tippanee ke liye kai atirikt anurodh milane ke par mul DNS protocol ke vistaar kaa prastaav kiya gaya he
 In 1984, four Berkeley students Douglas Terry, Mark Painter, David Riegel, and Sonia Zhou wrote the first UNIX implementation, which was later completed by Ralph Campbell

 tab se mike kairell, phil elmquist or paul viksi ne BIND ko jinda rakhaa he
 BIND was installed on the Windows NT platform in the early 1990s
 BIND ko vyapak rup se, visheshkar unics system par vitarit kiya gaya or yah internet par prayog hone vaala sabase prabhavi DNS software he
 As a result of overuse and testing of its open source code, as well as faster and more sophisticated attack methods, many security flaws were found in BIND
 isse kai vaikalpik nem sarwar or risolver prograamon kaa vikaas hua
 BIND was rewritten from scratch in version 9, whose security record is comparable to other modern Internet software
 domen nem spes main domen naamon kaa ek vriksh hota he
 Each node or leaf of the tree has zero or more resource records, which contain information associated with the domain name
 vriksh root jone main shuruyaat se zone main banta hota he
 a DNS zone consists of a collection of nodes connected to it that are officially sent by an official name server
 kisi bhi zone kii prashasnic jimmedaari banti ja sakati he jisase atirikt zone banate hai
 Normally rights for a part of the old space as a sub-domain can be delegated to another name server and administrative unit
 purana zone nae zone ke liye adhikrut nahin rahata
 a domain name is usually made up of two or more parts, which are traditionally separated by a dot such as example
com
 domen naam pranali ko ek vitarit databes pranali dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he he, jo client -sarwar model kaa upyog karata he
 The nodes of this database are name servers
 prayek domen yaa upadomen ek yaa ek se adhik aadhikarik DNS sarwar hai jo ki domen or iske adheen kisi bhi domen ke naam sarwar ke bare main jaankaree saarvajanik kar dete hai
 The chain has root nameservers at the top: they are queried when looking at the top level domain names
 DNS ke client chor ko DNS risolver kaha jaataa he
 It is responsible for initiating and sorting the demands so that the resource is fully resolved such as translation of domain name into IP address
 ek DNS poochtacha yaa to ek gaiyr punaravarti poochtacha yaa punaravarti poochtacha ho sakati he: The resolver or other DNS server recursively replacing the resolver negotiates the use of the recursive service by using bits in the query header
 aam taur par yah risolving jarurat kii jaankaree praapt karne ke liye kai naam sarvaron ke bich se guzarati he
 However, some resolvers operate in a simple way and can only communicate with a name server
 ye saral risolver jaankaree praapt karne ke liye ek punaravarti naam sarwar par nirbhar karte hai
 a domain name can have many name components

 At every step in the path, the program urges a DNS server to indicate the next server it should consult

 Being important in the overall functioning of a system, the burden of billions of queries each day will create an insurmountable bottleneck
 vyavhaar main is samasya par kaabo paane ke liye kaishing kaa prayog hota he or vastav main, root nem sarwar ko kul yatayaat ke bahut kam hisse kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 In delegation, name servers are displayed by name rather than listed by IP address
 iskaa arth yah he ki ek risolving naam sarwar ko ek nirdisht kiye gayi sarwar ke IP pate ko dhundne ke liye ek anya DNS anurodh avashya bhejnaa chahie
 Since this can result in a circular dependency condition, if a name server is specified under a domain that is subject to it, it is necessary that in such a case the name server delegation must also provide the IP address of the next name server do
 This record is called a glue record

 To date, the DNS resolution process allows for caching for a given period of time after a successful response
 kitne samay tak ek DNS risolver ek DNS pratikriya ko kaishe main rakhata he, yah ek mulya se nirdhaarit hota he jisase pratikriya kaa jivan samay kaha jaataa he
 The TTL DNS response is decided by the server's administrator
 avadhi kii vaidhata kuch second se din yaa kuch saptahon tak bhi ho sakati he
 As a notable result of this distributed and caching structure, changes to DNS records do not always take effect immediately and worldwide
 This can be illustrated through an example: if an administrator has set a 6-hour TTL for the host www
wikipedia
org and then the IP address containing www
wikipedia
org at 12:01 pm To be found, the administrator must think that the person who cached a response from the old IP address at 12:00 noon will not be able to contact the DNS server until 6:00 pm
 is udhaaharan main 12:01pm or 6:00pm ke bich kii avadhi ko kaishing samay kaha jaataa he, jo ki ek aise samay ke rup main sarvshereshth dhang se paribhaashit he jo tab shuru hota he jab aap DNS record main badlaav karte hai tathaa tab samaapt hota he jab titiel dwaara nirdisht samay kii adhiktam seemaa samaapt ho jaati he
 This is seen as an important logical thinking when making changes to DNS: not everyone is watching what you are seeing
 RFC 1912 titiel sthapit karne ke buniyadi niyamon ko bataane main madad karata he
 Note the term "diffusion" although it is used very widely in this context, does not describe the effects of caching well
 vishesh rup se, iskaa arth he ki jab aap ek DNS parivartan karte hai, yah kisi tarah anya DNS sarvaron main fail jaataa he or ki aapkaa kaishd kiye gayi record ke samay kii maatra par koi niyantran nahin he 
 Some resolvers also exceed TTL values because the protocol supports caching for up to 68 years or no caching at all
 nakaaratmak kaishing ek zone ke adhikrut naam sarwar dwaara nirdhaarit kii jaati he jisamen start of othority record kaa avashya ullekh kiya janaa chahie jab anurodh ke jawaab main koi bhi data reporting ke liye uplabdh nahin he
 The minimum area of the SOA record and the TTL of the SOA itself is used to establish the TTL for a negative answer
 RFC 2308 Many people incorrectly consider the mysterious 48 hours or 72 hours as propagation time when you make a DNS change
 yadi koi kisi domen kaa DNS record badal de yaa ek domen ke adhikrut DNS sarvaron ke host naamon kaa IP pataa badal de sabhi DNS sarvaron ko nayi soochna kaa prayog karne se pehle lambaa samay lag saktaa he
 This is because those records are handled by zone parent DNS servers, which typically cache those records for 48 hours
 haalanki, ye DNS parivartan kisi bhi DNS sarwar ke liye tatkaal uplabdh honge jisane unhen kaishd nahin kiya hoga
 And any DNS changes other than the NS record and authorized DNS server name on your domain will happen almost immediately, if you wish to do so
 
 The term "reverse lookup" refers to DNS querying to find the name associated with a given IP address
 DNS vishesh domen main IP pate ko PTR record ke rup main sangrahit karata he
 For ipv4, the domain is in-addr
arpa
 ipv6 ke liye, reverse lukup domen ip6
arpa he
 When performing a reverse lookup, the DNS client converts the address to the format used in DNS, and then follows the delegation chain as usual
 udhaaharan ke liye, ipv4 pataa '208
80
152
2', 2
152
80
208
in-addr
arpa main badal jaataa he
 The DNS resolver queries the root servers that point to the ARIN server for the 208
in-addr
arpa zone
 vahaan se 152
80
208
in ke liye vickemedia sarwar niyukt kiye gayi hai or PTR vickemedia nem sarwar se 2
152
80
208
in-addr
arpa ke liye poochtacha karke lukup purna karata he, jiske parinamswaroop ek ek aadhikarik parinaam miltaa he
 Users do not typically interact directly with a DNS resolver
 Instead DNS resolution makes space in application programs transparently such as web browsers, e-mail clients and other Internet applications / programs
 For program application requests that require domain name lookup, such programs send the resolution request to the DNS resolver in the local operating system, which in turn controls the communication required
 DNS risolver main lagbhag hameshaa hi haal main prayukt kiye gayi lukup kaa cash / sangrah hota he
 If the cache is able to answer the request, the resolver will reply to the cache to the requesting program
 yadi cash main uttar na ho to risolver ek yaa adhik nirdisht DNS sarvaron ko anurodh bhej degaa
 In the case of most home users, the Internet service provider that establishes the machine connection typically supplies this DNS server: the server address of such user will be configured manually or will allow DHCP to be determined, but where the system Systems are configured by administrators to use their DNS servers, their DNS resolvers are names that are kept separate from the organization
 Refers to the Hwar
 kisi bhi paristhiti main, poochtacha kiye jane vaala nem sarwar upar di gayi prakriya kaa paalan karegaa jab tak ki safaltaapurvak parinaam kaa pataa na lag jaae athwa na laga sake
 It then sends its result to the DNS resolver, assuming that it has found the answer, the resolver caches the answer for the future and sends the answer back to the software that initially asked the question
 jab risolver DNS protocol ke niyamon kaa ulanghan karata he to ek atirikt str kii jatilta ubhartee he
