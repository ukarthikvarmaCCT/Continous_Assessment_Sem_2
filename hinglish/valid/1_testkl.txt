 Nihilism or nothingness is the doctrine or doctrine of the department called Madhyamah, the Mahayana branch of Buddhists, in which the world is considered void and all its substances as powerless
 "madhyamik nyaay" ne "shoonyavad" ko darshanik siddhant ke rup main angeekrut kiya he
 According to this, both the known and the knowledge are imaginary
 parmaarthik tatv ekmaatr "shunya" hi he
 The "zero" essence is different from these four categories, asat, samsat and samsadvilakasana
 jagat is "shunya" kaa hi vivart he
 The root of Vivarta is Vavruti, which is also known as Avidya and Lust
 is mat ke anusaar karmkleshon kii nivritti hone par manushya nirvana praapt kar usee prakaar shant ho jaataa he jaise tel or batti samaapt hone par pradeep
 In Nagarjuna's view, the basic element is nothing other than zero
 dhyaan dene kii baat yah he ki yah shunya koi nishedhaatmak vastu nahin he jiskaa aplaap kiya ja sake
 It is possible to use only four categories in the design of any substance - parmarth in chaaron kotiyon se mukt hota he or isiilie uske abhidhaan ke liye "shunya" shabd kaa prayog ham karte hai
 In the words of Nagarjuna shoonyavad kii siddhi ke liye nagarjun ne vidhvansaatmak tark kaa upyog kiya he - vah tark, jiske sahare padaarth kaa vishleshan karte karte vah keval shunyarup main tik jaataa he
 On the strength of this argument, Nagarjuna has the credit for making a very serious, touching and original discussion of elements like matter, speed, caste, time, connection, soul, etc
 is mat main satya do prakaar kaa hota he - The first of which indicates practical power arising out of avidya; The second wisdom is the exponent of truth generated
 "sanvruti" shabd kaa arth he avidya
 Being indistinguishable, practical truth is known as communicative truth
 satya kii yah dwividh vyakhya nagarjun kii drushti main shoonyavad ke dwaara udbhavit nutan kalpana nahin he, pratyut buddha ke dwaara hi pracheen kaal main sanketit kii gai he
 Some of Buddha's teachings are given on the basis of practical truths; Other sermons are postponed above the orthodox truth
 abhisht donon he buddha ko - Nagarjuna, despite being a philosopher, was not a teacher who ignored behavior
 ve jaanate hai ki vyavhaar kaa bina aashray liye parmarth kaa upadesh hi nahin ho saktaa or parmarth kii prapti ke abhaav main nirvana mil nahin saktaa
 The intellect of ordinary human beings is so obsessed with behavior that behavior cannot be practiced to bring it to the altar
 falat: vyavhaar kii asatyata parmarth shabdon ke dwaara pratipaadya vastu nahin he
 That is why he is known by the designation of "illiteracy"
 parmarthatatv buddhivyapaar itani aasakt he ki use parmarth path par laane ke liye vyavhaar kaa aplaap nahin kiya ja saktaa
 As a result, by showing "untruth" of behavior, a seeker has to be distinguished in charity
 parmarth shabdon ke dwaara pratipaadya vastu nahin he
 That is why we know him by designation of the non-literal element
 parmarthatatv buddhivyapaar se agochar, avishay, sarvaprapanchanirmukt tathaa kalpanavirahit he, parantu uske upar jaagtik padaarthon kaa samarope karne se hi uskaa gyaan hamen ho saktaa he
 This element bears a similar resemblance to the supervention and exception of Vedantis

 The agrarian movement in India is growing at a fast pace in the Mojuda era, mainly because the economic condition of the farmer is getting weaker day by day and he is getting stuck in the spider web of debt, because in the present era, the cost of agriculture is increasing
 Due to which the incidents of self-murder are increasing in the farmers

 Part of a category on Vedic religion moksh Meditation yoga jai or vijay donon bhagwaan vishnu ke dwarpal the, inaki murkhataa ke kaaran inako shraap mila
 Once the craze, Sanandan, Sanatan and Santkumar went to the Baikunta world to see Lord Vishnu for peace of mind after being disenchanted with the whole world
 baikuntha ke dwaar par jai or vijay naam ke do dwarpal paharaa diya karte the
 Jai and Vijay stopped these sancadic sages at the door itself and started refusing to enter the Baikuntha lok
 unke is prakaar manaa karne par sanakadik rishiyon ne kaha, "are moorkhon! ham to bhagwaan vishnu ke param bhakt hai
 Our speed does not stop anywhere
 ham devadhidev ke darshan karnaa chaahate hai
 Why do you stop us from seeing them? You people live in the service of God, you should be as equitable as them
 bhagwaan kaa swabhaav param shantimay he, tumhaara swabhaav bhi vaisaa hi hona chaiye
 Let us go to see Lord Vishnu
 " rishiyon ke is prakaar kehane par bhi jai or vijay unhen baikuntha ke andar jane se rokane lage
 On stopping this type of Jai and Vijay, the Sankadik sages got angry and said, "even after being close to Lord Vishnu, egoism has come in you and the egoist cannot live in Baikunth
 isaliye ham tumhen shaap dete hai ki tum log paapayoni main jaao or apane paap kaa fal bhugto
 "jai and Vijay, fearing their cursing, fell at his feet and asked for forgiveness
 yah jaan kar ki sanakadik rishigan bhent karne aaye hai bhagwaan vishnu swayan lakshmi ji evam apane samast parshadon ke saath unke swaagat ke liy padhaare
 Lord Vishnu said to him, "O Munishvara! These are my councilors named Jai and Vijay
 in donon ne ahankaar buddhi ko dhaaran kar aapkaa apmaan karke aparaadh kiya he
 You people are my dear devotees and they have disobeyed you by disobeying you
 inako shaap dekar aapane uttam kaary kiya he
 These followers have scorned the ascetics and i consider them to be my own scorn

 Due to this generosity of God he became very happy and said, "you give so much respect for keeping the dignity of religion
 he nath! hamane in nirparaadh parshadon ko krodh ke vash main hokar shaap de diya he iske liye ham kshamaa chaahate hai
 If you think it is appropriate, you can forgive these gatekeepers and get rid of our curse
 " Lord Vishnu said, "O monks! i do not want to make the Brahmin's word untrue even after being omnipotent because it violates religion
 aapane jo shaap diya he vah meri hi prerana se hua he
 They are definitely part of this punishment
 ye diti ke garbh main jaakar daitya yoni ko praapt karenge or mere dwaara inkaa sanhaar hoga
 They will remain engrossed in my attention, even while being hostile to me

 los angelis Houston islam main allaah ke naam : parampara ke mutabik, islam main allaah ke kam se kam 99 naam hai, jinhen' asmau allaahi al-husnaa " allaah ke sundar naam " ke rup main janaa jaataa he 
 According to the 9th-century collection of Hadiths, the tradition of having "99 names" is correct, while the tradition of the actual list of 99 names given by some collectors in at least three different forms is called Poor
 in soochiyon main adhiktar naam quran ke paath se liya gaya hai, maukhik parampara yaa sunnat main alpsankhyak ke saath kiya gaya he

 There is no universal agreement among Muslims as to what really counts as the name of Allah, and what does not
 iske atirikt, jabaki kuch naam keval quran main hai, or anya keval haddees main hai, kuch aise naam hai jo donon main dikhaai dete hai
 Different sources give different lists of 99 names

 javashan kabir main arabi ke 1000 se adhik naam soochibaddh hai 
 The Arabic names of Allah are used as theophoric names commonly used in Muslim cultures throughout the world, including non-arabic speaking societies

 According to Pakistan fast bowler and great all-rounder Imran Khan and cricket expert John Birmingham, Richards could not have faced any other batsman as easily as he faced pure fast bowlers
 kai purv cricketer ek ballebaaz ke taur par unki pratibha kaa kaaphi sammaan karte hai
 Ian Chappell says that after Sir Garfield Sobers, he has not seen a talented batsman like Richard, while the great South African batsman Barry Richards, former Indian captain and commentator Ravi Shastri and former England batsman Neil Fairbrother, according to him, have a second like Richards in his life

 Richders had his own style of batting, his unique approach from entering the field to reaching the pitch is still fresh in the minds of cricket fans
 unki ballebaaji style kaa varnan karne ke liye aksar "akad" shabd kaa istemaal kiya jaataa tha
 His batting was often completely dominated by the bowlers' opposition
 unki nazar itani paini or unki timming itani sateek hoti thi ki wo of stump ke baahar padi gudlength kii gend ko bhi midwicket par aasaani se khel jate the, richards ke hook shaat khilne kaa andaaz bhi niraala tha

 2005 tak van de cricket itihaas ke wo ek maatr aise khilaadi the, jisane ek hi match main shatak jadne ke saath hi match main paanch khilaadiyon ko bhi out kiya, ye karnama unhone 1986-87 main newzealand ke khilaaf dunedin van de main anjaam diya

 haalanki club main unke totum upasthiti ke baavjood 1985 or 1986 main wo kuch khaas nahin kar sake, yahi vajah he ki katri championships main unki team nichle paaydaan par pahunch gai
 Captain Peter Reebok's decision not to extend the contract of Richard and partner Geol Garner for the 1987 season led Somerset not to pursue his and Geol Garner's contract, whose runs and wickets helped the county great success in the prior eight years Was found county ne unke sthaan par newzealand ke martin kro ko anubandhit kiya, is faisale se naaraaz hokar ian batham ne bhi summersat se apana qaraar aage nahin badhaayaa or vorecestershire main shaamil ho gaye

 For example, Vinayapitaka has a detailed description of the rules regarding the behavior of Buddhist monks

 'chullavagg' describes the progress of the nuns
 yahan bhikshuon ke liye jo shalaka-grahan kii paddati bataai gayi he
 It is an imitation of the 'vote' custom of the then Lichchavi Republic
 us samay ke ganatantr shashan main koi prastaav pesh karne ke baad, prastaav ko duhraate hue uske vishay main teen baar tak bolne kaa avasar diya jaataa tha

 It was composed by Tismamogaliputt during the time of Emperor Ashoka

 Eight stories are also in Pali language

 Thereafter, Acharya Buddhaghosha converted these Sinhala fables into Pali in the 5th century AD

 On 11 December 2014, for the first time after so much fame, the United Nations General Assembly has recognized 21 June each year as World Yoga Day
 bhagavadgita pratishthit granth mana jaataa he
 The word yoga has been used many times in it, sometimes alone and sometimes in particular, such as Buddhayoga, Sanyasayoga, Karmayoga
 vedottar kaal main bhaktiyog or hathyog naam bhi prachlit ho gaye hai patanjali yogadarshan main kriyayog shabd dekhne main aata he
 Words like Pashupat Yoga and Maheshwar Yoga also have references
 in sab sthalon main yoga shabd ke jo arth hai vah ek duusare ke virdohi hai parantu is prakaar ke vibhinn prayogon ko dekhne se yah to spasht ho jaataa he, ki yoga kii paribhaasha karnaa kathin kaary he
 The definition should be such that it is free from imprecision and extraterrestrial defects, to describe such a symptom of the meaning of the word yoga which is suitable for every subject and is not suitable for anything other than yoga
 ‘yoga’ shabd ‘yuj samadhu’ aatmanepadi divadiganiya dhaatu main ‘ghan’ pratyay lagane se nishpann hota he
 In this way, the word 'yoga' means samadhi, that is, the removal of the mind
 vaise ‘yoga’ shabd ‘yujir yoga’ tathaa ‘yuj sanyamne’ dhaatu se bhi nishpann hota he kintu tab is sthiti main yoga shabd kaa arth kramshah yogafal, jod tathaa niyaman hoga
 In Yoga further, we will see that Yoga has also been said about the soul and God
 gita main shrikrishna ne ek sthal par kaha he 'yoga: karmsu kaushalm' 
 It is clear that this sentence is not the definition of yoga
 kuch vidwaanon kaa yah mat he ki jeevatma or paramatma ke mil jane ko yoga kehete hai
 It takes great objection to accept that even Buddhists, who do not accept the authority of God, behave and support the word Yoga
 yahi baat sankhyavaadiyon ke liye bhi kahi ja sakati he jo ishwar kii satta ko asiddh maanate hai
 In Yogadarshan, Pantjali, which has given the definition as 'yogashtantavritti nirodha', is the name of the prevention of the chrittis
 is vaakya ke do arth ho sakate hai: chittavritiyon ke nirodh kii avasthaa kaa naam yoga he yaa is avasthaa ko laane ke upaay ko yoga kehete hai
 But many scholars have objected to this definition
 unka kahana he ki chittavritiyon ke pravaah kaa hi naam chitt he
 Complete detention would mean the complete omission of the existence of the mind, the removal of all the memories and rituals of the mind
 yadi aisa ho jaae to phir samadhi se uthanaa sambhav nahin hoga
 Because no sacrament would have survived for the support of that stage, the destiny would have been burnt
 nirodh yadi sambhav ho to shrikrishna ke is vaakya kaa kya arth hoga? yogasth: kuru karmani, yoga main sthit hokar karm karo
 There can be no karma in the antithesis and in that state no sanskars can be performed, memories cannot be made, which are helpful in performing karma after getting up from samadhi

 Here, it is necessary to think a little about the process whose outline we find in Patanjali's formulas

 The description of the means by which many seekers used to reach the high stage of yoga, samadhi, moksha, kaivalya etc

 mantrajp mukhyarup se chaar prakaar se kiya jaataa he
 The literal meaning of hatha is derived from stubbornly doing something

 maharishi patanjali ke anusaar samahit chitt waalon ke liye abhyaas or vairaygy tathaa veikshipt chitt waalon ke liye kriyayog kaa sahaara lekar aage badhane kaa rasta sujhaayaa he

 Many sculptures that display common yoga or samadhi mudra have been found at the site of the Indus Valley Civilization
 puraatatvajna gregory possehl ke anusaar," ye murtiyan yoga ke dharmik sanskaar" ke yoga se sambandh ko sanket karti he

 dhyaan main ucch chaitanya ko praapt karne ki ritiyon kaa vikaas shramanik paramparaon dwaara evam upanishad kii parampara dwaara viksit hua tha
 There is no concrete evidence about meditation in the ancient and ancient Brahminic texts of the Buddha, based on the sentences of the two Buddha's teachers towards the goals of meditation, Vayana argues that the method of Nirguna meditation originated from the Brahmin tradition, hence the Upanishads
 There is a similarity in the sayings towards the creation and the sayings for the goals of meditation
 yah sambhavit ho bhi saktaa he, nahin bhi
 In the Upanishads, in the cosmic statements of cosmic statements, they argue for the possibility of the practice of any meditation, saying that the Narada Sukta also points towards the method of meditation before the Rig Veda
 yah buddha granth shaayad sabase pracheen granth he jin main dhyaan takneekon kaa varnan praapt hota he

 mahatvapurn granth jo yoga kii avadharana se sambandhit he ve madhya kaaleen upanishad, mahabharat,bhagavad gita 200 BCE) evam patanjali yoga sutara he
 In Indian philosophy, one of the six philosophies is called Yoga
 yoga darshanik pranali,sankhya skool ke saath nikatataa se sambandhit he
 The Yoga sect, as interpreted by the sage Patanjali, accepts Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is more theistic than the Samkhya gharana, a proof because divine power is also added to the twenty-five elements of Samkhya reality
 yoga or sankhya ek duusare se itane milte-julate he ki mex mullar kehete he,"yah do darshan itane prasiddh the ki ek duusare kaa antar samajhane ke liye ek ko prabhu ke saath or duusare ko prabhu ke bina mana jaataa he

 Patanjali is widely regarded as the founder of formal yoga philosophy
 patanjali ke yoga, buddhi kaa niyantran ke liye ek pranali he,raaj yoga ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Patanjali defines the word "yoga" in his second sutra, which is considered the interpretation formula for his entire work: yoga: chitt-vritti nirodh: - yoga sutara 1
2 This Sanskrit definition rests on the meaning of three Sanskrit words
 ai
ke
taimni isaki anuwaad karte he kii,"yoga buddhi ke sanshodhano kaa nishedh he" 
 The use of the term nirodhaḥ in the early definition of yoga is an example that intellectual technical terminology and concepts play an important role in the Yoga Sutra; This indicates that Patanjali was aware of Buddhist ideas and weaves them into his system
 Swami Vivekananda translates this sutra saying, "yoga blocks the intellect from taking various forms
 patanjali kaa lekhan 'ashtaang yoga" ek pranali ke liye aadhaar ban gaya
 There are eight parts: is sampradaay ke vichaar me, ucchtam prapti vishwa ke anbhavi vividhta ko bhram ke rup me prakat nahin karata
yah duniya vastav he
 Furthermore, the highest attainment is an event where one of the many personalities invents itself, not one universal self that is shared by all individuals
 bhagavad gita, bade paimaane par vibhinn tareekon se yoga shabd kaa upyog karata he
 In addition to an entire chapter devoted to the practice of traditional yoga, including meditation, three major types of yoga are introduced
 madhusoodana saraswati ne gita ko teen virgon main vibhajit kiya he, jahaan pratham chah adhyyon me karm yoga ke bare me, bich ke chah me bhakthi yoga or pichley chah adhyyon me gyana yoga ke bare me gaya he
 Other commentators attribute each chapter to a different 'yoga', where eighteen different yogas are described
 hathyog yoga, yoga kii ek vishesh pranali he jise 15veen sadi ke bharat main hath yoga pradipika ke sankalak, yogi swatmarama dwaara varnit kiya gaya tha
 Hatha Yoga is quite different from Patanjali's Raja Yoga which focuses on sattkarma, the purification of the physical body brings purification of the mind, life and specific energy
 keval patanjali raaj yoga ke dhyaan asana ke badale, yah puure sharir ke lokapriy asana kii charchaa karata he
 Hatha Yoga is a style in many of its modern variations that many people associate with the word "yoga"
 pracheen bauddhik dharm ne dhyanaparaneey avasorana avasthaa ko nigamit kiya
 The earliest ancient manifestations of yoga ideas are found in the early sermons of the Buddha
 buddha ke ek pramukh naveen shikshan yah tha kii dhyanaparaneey avasorana ko paripurna abhyaas se sanyukt kare
 buddha ke upadesh or pracheen brahmanik granthon main prastut antar vicitra he
 According to the Buddha, the meditative state is not the only end, salvation is not attained even in the highest meditative state
 apane vichaar ke purna viraam praapt karne ke bajaay, kisi prakaar kaa maansik sakriyata hona chahie:ek mukti anubhuti, dhyaan jaagrukta ke abhyaas par aadhaarit hona chahie
 The Buddha rejected the ancient cosmic intent to get rid of death
 The Brahminic yogins consider liberation in a non-meditative state where death is experienced
 buddha ne yoga ke nipun kii maut par mukti paane kii puraane brahminic anyokt ko ek nayaa arth diya; unhen, rishi jo jivan main mukt he ke naam se ullekh kiya gaya tha
 Yogakaramahayana is a form of Buddhism
 buddha dharm kii mahayan sampradaay yoga ke saath apni nikatataa ke kaaran vikhyath kiya jaataa he
 In the West, Zen is often arranged with yoga; the two sects of meditation display clear family paradigms
 yah ghatana ko vishesh dhyaan yogya he kyonki kuch yoga prathaon par dhyaan kii zen bauddhik skool aadhaarit he
 Some of the essential elements of yoga are important to Buddhism in general and Zen religion in particular
 yoga tibeti buddha dharm kaa centre he
 In the Nyingma tradition, the path of the practice of meditation is divided into nine yanas, or vahana, it is said to be supremely visible
 antim ke chah ko "yoga yanas" ke rup me varnit kiya jaataa he, yah he:kriya yoga, up yoga, yoga yana, maha yoga, anu yoga or antim abhyaas ati yoga
 sarama paramparaon nemahayog or atiyog kii anuttara varg se sthanapann karte hue kriya yoga, upa or yoga ko shaamil kiya hai
 Other tantra yoga practices include the practice of breath and heart rhythm with 108 bodily postures
 anya tantra yoga prathaon 108 shaareerik mudraon ke saath saans or dil taal kaa abhyaas ko shaamil hai
 This Nyingma tradition also practices Yantra Yoga
 , yah ek anushaasan he jisame saans kaary, dhyanaparaneey manan or sateek gatisheel chaal se anusaran karanevaale kaa dhyaan ko ekagrit karte he
 The body postures of Tibetan ancient yogis are depicted on the walls of the Dalai Lama's Samar temple in Lukhang 
 chang dwaara ek arddh tibeti yoga ke lokapriy khate ne kandali apane sharir main garmi kaa utpaadan kaa ullekh karte hue kehete he ki "yah sampurna tibeti yoga kii buniyaad he"
 chang yah bhi daawa karte he ki tibeti yoga praana or man ko sulah karata he, or use tantrism ke saidhantik nihitarth se sambandhit karte he
 According to the Jain text Tattvarthasutra of the second century, mind, speech and body are the total 'sum' of all activities
 umaswami kehete he ki asrav yaa carmik pravaah kaa kaaran yoga he saath hi- samyak charitra arthath yoga niyantran or ant main nirodh mukti ke maarg me behad aavashyak he
 In his Niyamsara, Acharya Kundakunda has described Yoga Bhakti - the path of liberation from devotion - as the highest form of devotion
 acharya haribhadra or acharya hemachandra ke anusaar paanch pramukh ullekh sanyasiyon or 12 samaajik laghu pratigyaaon yoga ke antargat shaamil he
 Because of this view some endolists such as Prof
 Robert J
 Zydenbos said about Jainism that it is essentially a scheme of Yoga thinking that grew into a complete religion
 dow henrich zimmar santusht kiya ki yoga pranali ko purv aryan kaa mul tha, jisane vedon kii satta ko sweekaar nahin kiya or isliye jain dharm ke samaan use ek vidharmik siddhanton ke rup main mana gaya tha Jain scripture depicts the Jain Tirthankaras in the Padmasana or Kayotsarga yoga posture
 aisa kaha gaya he ki mahavir ko mulabandhasana sthiti main baithe kevala gyaan "atmagyaan" praapt hua jo achranga sutara me or baad main kalpasutra me pehali saahitiyik ullekh ke rup me paaya gaya he
 Patanjali is a supernatural analogy in the five Yama or obstacles of Yogasutra and the five major vows of Jainism, indicating a strong influence of Jainism
 lekhak vivian vorthington ne yah sweekaar kiya ki yoga darshan or jain dharm ke bich parsparik prabhaav he or ve likhte he:"yoga puri tarah se jain dharm ko apana rin maanata he or vinimay me jain dharm ne yoga ke saadhnaaon ko apane jivan kaa ek hissaa bana liya"
 The Indus Valley seals and econography also provide a fair evidence that there is a communal resemblance between the Yoga tradition and Jainism
 vishesh rup se, vidwaanon or puratatvavidon ne vibhinn tirthankaron kii muharon main darshai gai yoga or dhyaan mudraon ke bich samaantaaon par tippanee kii he: rishabhdev kii "kayotsarga" mudra or mahavir ke mulabandhasana muharon ke saath dhyaan mudra main pakshon main sarpon kii khudaai parswanath kii khudaai se milti julati he
 All these not only indicate links between Indus Valley Civilization and Jainism, but also demonstrate the contribution of Jainism to various yoga practices
 pracheenatam ke jain dharmavaidhanik sahitya jaise achrangasutra or niyamasra, tattwarthsutra aadi jaise granthon ne saadhaaran vyakti or tapasweeyon ke liye jivan kaa ek maarg ke rup main yoga par kai sandarbh die he
 Later texts, which elaborate on the Jain concept of yoga, are as follows: sufi sangeet ke vikaas main bhartiya yoga abhyaas kaa kaaphi prabhaav he, jahaan ve donon shaareerik mudraon or shwaas niyantran ko anukulit kiya he
 The ancient Indian yoga text, Amritkund, was translated into Arabic and Persian languages in the late 11th century
 san 2008 main malaysia ke sheersh islamic samiti ne kaha jo muslmaan yoga abhyaas karte he unke khilaaf ek fatwa lagu kiya, jo kanoonee taur par gaiyr badhyakaari he, kehete he ki yoga main "hindu aadhyatmik upadeshon" ke tatwon he or is se ish-ninda ho sakati he or isliye yah haraam he
 Muslim yoga teachers in Malaysia criticized the decision as an "insult"
 The women's group in Malaysia also expressed their disappointment and said they would continue their yoga classes
 This fatwa states that yoga practice as a physical exercise is permissible, but prohibits the singing of religious mantras, and also states that teaching such as human union with God is not in line with Islamic philosophy
 isi tarah,ulemus kii parishad, indonesia main ek islamic samiti ne yoga par pratibandh, ek fatve dwaara lagu kiya kyonki isamen "hindu tatv" shaamil the
 But these Fatwas have been criticized by Darul Uloom Deoband, which is the school of Deobandi Islam in India
 san 2009 may main, turki ke nideshaalay ke dharmik maamalon ke mantralay ke pradhan shaasha ali bardaakoglu ne yoga ko ek vyavsaayik udhyam ke rup main ghoshit kiya- yoga ke sambandh main kuch aalochanaye jo islam ke tatwon se mail nahin khaatin
 In 1989, the Vatican declared that Eastern meditation practices such as Zen and Yoga could "degenerate into a faction of the body"
 vatican ke bayaan ke baavjood, kai roman catholic unke aadhyatmik prathaon main yoga, buddha dharm or hindu dharm ke tatwon kaa prayog kiya he
 Tantra is a practice in which the relations of those who follow them bring changes in ordinary, religious, social and logical reality
 tantric abhyaas main ek vyakti vaastaviktaa ko maaya, bhram ke rup main anubhav karata he or yah vyakti ko mukti praapt hota he
 Among the many passages of nirvana offered by Hinduism, this particular passage links tantra to practices of Indian religions such as yoga, meditation, and social renunciation, which are based on temporary or permanent withdrawal from social relationships and methods
 tantric prathaon or adhyayan ke dauraan, chaatr ko dhyaan takanic main, vishesh rup se chakra dhyaan, kaa nirdesh diya jaataa he
 The way this meditation is known and compared with the methods of Tantric followers and yogis is in a limited form, but is more elaborate than the previous meditation of initiation
 ise ek prakaar kaa kundalini yoga mana jaataa he jiske madhyam se dhyaan or puja ke liye "hriday" main sthit chakra main devi ko sthapit karte he
 By the way, yoga has always been our ancient heritage
 samay ke saath-saath yoga vishwa prakhyat to hua hi he saath hi iske mahatv ko jaanane ke baad aaj yoga logon kii dincharya kaa abhinn ang bhi ban gaya he
 But world-renowned yoga teachers have also contributed to the promotion of yoga, of which the names of Ayyangar Yoga founder BKS Ayyangar and Yogaguru Ramdev are more famous
 ayangar ko vishwa ke agrani yoga guruon main se ek mana jaataa he or unhone yoga ke darshan par kai kitaaben bhi likhi thim, jinamein 'lite on yoga', 'lite on pranayam' or 'lite on da yoga sutraj of patanjali' shaamil hai
 Iyengar was born on 14 December 1918 in a poor family in Bellur
 bataaya jaataa he ki ayangar bachapan main kaaphi biimaar rahaa karte the
 When he was not well, he was advised to do yoga and from then on he started doing yoga

 Yoga is very beneficial
 yoga na keval hamaare dimag, mastishk ko hi takat pahunchaata he balki hamaari aatma ko bhi shuddh karata he
 Many people are troubled by obesity today, yoga is very beneficial for them

 In the Mahabharata, the goal of yoga is described as Brahma's entry into the world, as Brahmā, or experiencing the Atman that pervades all things
 mircha eliyade yoga ke bare main kehete hai ki yah sirf ek shaareerik vyaayaam hi nahin he, ek aadhyatmik takanic bhi he

 nepal kaa rashtriya dhvaj vishwa kaa ek maatr aisa jhanda he jo chaukor yaa ytaakar nahin he jo do trikoniya aakaar ko upar neeche rakh kar banaaya gaya he
 Another flag in the world which is not square is that of Ohaio in America
 nepal ke rashtri jhande ke upar vaale trikon main ek ardh chaand or neeche vaali trikon main ek surya ankit he jiskaa matlab bataaya jaataa he ki jab tak suraj-chaand rahegaa tab tak prithvi par nepal kaa astitv rahegaa
 The edges of this flag are covered with blue color, which is a symbol of peace
 dhvaj ke bich kaa bhaag gahare laal rang kaa he jo nepal kaa rashtriya rang he
 The national flower of Nepal is also of the same color
 gaharaa laal vijay kaa bhi pratik he
 Until 1962, there were faces on the moon and sun on the flag of Nepal
 dhvaj kaa aadhunikeekaran karne ke liye dhvaj ke chandra or surya par se chehre ko hataa diya gaya lekin phir bhi raja apane dhvaj par chaand or suraj par chehre kaa prayog rajtantr khatm hone tak karata rahaa
 This flag was adopted on 16 December 1962 when the new constitution of the country was written
 yah anokhaa trikoniya dhvaj shatabdiyon se nepal main prayog main chalata rahaa lekin dwi trikoniya dhvaj kaa istemaal 19 veen shatabdi se chalan main aayaa
 Today's form of the flag is derived from its primary form which has been in use since 2000 years ago
 sabhi chote riyasaton ko ekikaran karne ke baad prithvinarayan shah ne is dhvaj ko apanaaya
 At the present time, the principle of the flag has changed

 Deep red is the national color of Nepal and it also displays the antithesis of Nepalese

 The celestial bodies that have been seen on this are a symbol of stability, they hope that Nepal will exist as long as the sun and moon remain
 chaand yah bhi darshata he ki nepali log shantipriy or shant mizaaj ke hote hai, jabaki surya darshata he ki nepali bhayankar sankalpavaadi hote hai
 The moon also signifies the coolness of the Himalayan region of Nepal, while the sun indicates the warmth of the Terai region

 The galaxy is a spiral galaxy in shape, with a large center and several curved arms emanating from it
 hamaara saura mandal isaki shikari-hans bhujaa par sthit he
 There are between 100 billion and 400 billion stars in the galaxy and it is estimated that there will be about 50 billion planets, of which 500 million are at a distance from their stars to keep life-worthy temperatures
 san 2011 main hone vaale ek surveykshan main yah sambhaavna paayi gai ki is anumaan se adhik grah hon - is adhyayan ke anusaar akashganga main taron kii sankhya se dugane grah ho sakate hai
 Our solar system is located on the outskirts of the galaxy and is orbiting the center of the galaxy
 ise ek puri parikrama karne main lagbhag 22
5 se 25 karod varsh lag jate hai
 In Sanskrit and many other indo-aryan languages, our Galaxy is called "milky Way"
 puraanon main akashganga or prithvi par sthit ganga nadi ko ek dusre kaa joda mana jaataa tha or donon ko pavitra mana jaataa tha
 The galaxy has been called "kshir" in ancient Hindu religious texts
 bhartiya upmahadweep ke baahar bhi kai sabhyataaon ko akashganga dudhia lagi
 The word "galaxy" originates from the Greek word "gala", which also means milk
 farsi sanskrit kii hi tarah ek hind-irani bhashaa he, isliye uskaa "doodh" ke liye shabd sanskrit ke "ksheer" se miltaa-julata sajaateey shabd "sheer" he or akashganga ko "raah-e-shiri" bulaayaa jaataa he
 In English, the Milky Way is called the "milky Way", which also means "milk path"
 kuch purvi asian sabhyataaon ne "akashganga" shabd kii tarah akashganga main ek nadi dekhi
 The galaxy is called the "river of Silver" in Chinese and also "mirinae" in Korean
 akashganga ek sarpil gallexi he
 The diameter of its flat circle is about 100,000 light-years but its thickness is only 1,000 light-years
 akashganga kitni badi he iskaa anumaan is baat se lagaaya ja saktaa he ke agar hamaare puure saura mandal ke chakra ke kshetrafal ko ek rupee ke sikke jitna samaj liya jaae to uski tulana main akashganga kaa kshetrafal bharat kaa dedh guna hoga
 It is estimated that there are at least 1 trillion stars in the galaxy, but it is possible that the number may be up to 4 trillion
 tulana ke liye hamaari padosi gallexi andromeeda main 10 kharab taare ho sakate hai
 Andromeda also has a spiral shape
 akashganga ke chakra kii koi aisi seemaa nahin he jiske baad taare ekadam na hon, balki seemaa ke paas taron kaa ghanatv dhire-dhire kam hota jaataa he
 It has been observed that after a distance of 40,000 light years from the center, the density of stars starts decreasing rapidly
 vaigyanik iskaa kaaran abhi thik se samaj nahin paae hai
 Outside the main arms, there is a ring of stripped wires from another galaxy over a period of years, called a unicorn ring
 akashganga ke ird-gird ek gallexic sehara bhi he, jisamen taare or plasma gas kam ghanatv main maujuud he, lekin is sehre kaa aakaar akashganga kii do majalanic badal naam kii upgrahiy gallexiyon ke kaaran simit he
 Because humans are located within the circle of the galaxy, we have not been able to infer its exact shape
 ham puure akashganga ke chakra or uski bhujaaon ko dekh nahin sakate
 We get a full view of thousands of other galaxies in the sky, from which we get to know the different categories of galaxies
 akashganga kaa adhyayan karne ke baad ham keval anumaan laga sakate hai ke yah sarpil shrenee kii gallexi he
 But it is very difficult to find out how many main and how small asterisks the galaxy has
 upar se yah bhi dekha gaya he ke anya sarpil gallexiyon main bhujaayen kabhi-kabhi ajeeb dishaao main mudi hui hoti hai yaa phir vibhajit hokar upabhujaayen banati hai
 Scientists differ in the size of the arms due to these intricacies
 2008 tak mana jaataa tha ke akashganga kii chaar mukhya bhujaayen hai or kam-se-kam do choti bhujaayen hai, jinamein se ek shikari-hans bhujaa he jisapar hamaara saura mandal sthit he
 In a picture on the right, different arms are shown in different colors - 2008 main visconsin vishvavidhyalay ke robert banjamin ne apane anusandhan kaa nateeja ghoshit karte hue daawa kiya ke darasal akashganga kii keval do mukhya bhujaayen hai - parasius bhujaa or skutem-santoras bhujaa - or baaqi sari choti bhujaayen hai
 If this is true, then the size of the galaxy will be different from Andromeda and will be like a spiral galaxy named NGG 1365
 1990 ke dashak tak vaigyanik samajha karte the ke akashganga kaa ghanaa kendriya bhaag ek gole ke akar kaa he, lekin phir unhen shaq hone laga ke uskaa aakaar ek mote danda kii tarah he
 Photographs taken from the Spitzer Space Telescope in 2005 made it clear that his fears were correct: the center of the galaxy was actually a dandenoid shaped more than a sphere
 2007 main akashganga main ek "echi 1523-0901" naam ke taare kii aayu 13

 Two galaxies, called large and small magellanic clouds, are orbiting the galaxy

 In view of the difficulty faced in preparing the program by machine language and assembly language, computer scientists got involved in the research that now such programming language should be prepared which is not dependent on computer machine
 computer programing bhashaa ke vikaas kaa yah aglaa kadam tha
 Compiler and interpreter were developed in place of assembler
 ab computer program likhane ke liye masini bhashaa ko ankiy kriyanvayan sanketo ke sthaan par akshar chinh smaranopkaaree kaa prayog kiya gaya
 The language used in computers in which programs are written using English letters, numbers and symbols is called high level programming language
 is bhashaa main program likhnaa programmer ke liye bahut hi aasaan hota he, kyonki isame kisi bhi nirdesh mashin code main badalakar likhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti
 Such as - BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, PASCAL | Now high level programming languages have developed
 in programing bhashaao ko karyaanusaar chaar virgo main vibhajit kiya gaya he- vaigyanik programing bhashaaen- inkaa prayog mukhyat: vaigyanik kaaryo ke liye program banane main hota he, parantu iname se kuch bhashaaen ansi bhi hoti he jo vaigyanik kaaryo ke alaava anya kaaryo ko bhi utani hi dakshata se karti he
 Such as - ALGOL, BASIC, PASCAL, FORTRAN, etc
 vyavsaayik programing bhashaaen-vyapaarik kaaryo se sambandhit jaise-bahi khaataa, rozaanaamachaa, stock aadi kaa lekha jokha aadi vyapaarik programing bhashaao ke program dwaara atyant saralata se kiya ja saktaa he
 Such as PL1, COBOL, DBASE etc
 vishesh uddeshy programing bhashaaen-ye bhashaaen vibhinn kaaryo ko vishesh kshamta ke saath karne ke liye prayog kii jaati he
 Eg- APL360- Peripheral devices are used for best application
 yah bhashaa 1968 se prachlan main ai
 The logo-logo was developed just to simplify computer education
 is bhashaa main chithran itnaa saral he ki chote bachche bhi chithran kar sakate hai
 There is a special type of triangular shape for illustration in the logo language, called turtle
 monitor par pradarshit rahata he logo bhashaa ke nirdesho dwaara yah taratal, kisi bhi taraf gum saktaa he or aage-peeche chal saktaa he
 When the turtle moves, it streaks backwards on its path
 isse anek prakaar ke chitro ko saralata se banaaya ja saktaa he
 Multipurpose languages - languages that have the ability to perform many different types of tasks in the same way are called multipurpose languages
 jaise- BASIC,PASCAL,PL1| High level programming languages do not depend on a computer machine
 yah ek atyant mahatvapurn uplabdhi he
 This program runs evenly after the micro-correction, in different alus and control units, when the user of the program changes the computer
 in bhashaao main prayog kiye jane vaale shabd saamaanya angreji bhashaa main hote hai
 In these programming languages, the possibility of mistakes is less and mistakes can be found quickly and rectified
 prayog kiya gaya anuvadak compiler athwa interprator program main kis line or nirdesh main galati he yah swayan hi suchit kar detaa he
 It takes less time and labor to write a program
 in bhashaao main likhaa gaya program chalane main masini bhashaa or asembli bhashaa main likhe gayi program kii apeksha computer kii mukhya smriti main adhik sthaan gherta he
 These languages do not have flexibility because it is not under the control of the programmer due to the self-control of the translator
 lacheelepan se taatpary he ki kuch vishesh kaary in programing bhashaao main nahin kiye ja sakate hai athwa atyant kathinaayee se saath kiye ja sakate hai
 However, the features of a high-level programming language are more effective than its limitations
 at: vartmaan main yahi bhashaaen prayog kii jaati he
 If we look at the history of the development of programming languages, Dr
 Grace Hopper's name holds an important place
 inhone hi san 1952 ke aas-paas ucch stareey bhashaao kaa vikaas kiya tha
 In which a compiler was used
 dow haper ke nirdesan main do ucch stareey programing bhashaao ko viksit kiya gaya pehali-flowmatic or MATHEMATICS
 FLOWMATIC was a commercial programming language and MATHEMATICS was a language used in arithmetic calculations
 tab se lekar ab tak lagbhag 225 ucch stareey programing bhashaao kaa vikaas ho chukaa he
 Examples: FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, PASCAL

 When the legs of such children are stretched and their two heels are mixed, then there is a great difference between the knees of both the legs
 janm ke pratham varsh main hi, jyon jyon baccha bada hota jaataa he, isamen parivartan dikhaai dene lagata he
 On spreading the legs, both the knees start coming closer respectively
 donon prajnghika haddiyaan sidhi ho jaati hai tathaa talue neeche apni prakritik disha kii ore aa jate hai
 At the time these changes occur, those bones, which were previously made of cartilage, take the form of full bone
 ek swasth bachche main, jab tak vah chalane yogya hota he, pair kii haddiyaan apni disha or dridhtaa main is prakaar kii ho jaati hai ki khadey hone par bachche ke sampurna sharir ke bhaar ko sah saken
 Sometimes if the children try to walk ahead of time or are forced to move, then the feet start to become slightly crooked
 isi samay yadi baccha kamjor yaa sookhaa rogagrast ho, use paushtik bhojanak khilaayaa pilaayaa na gaya ho athwa kuch aise rogon se aakraant ho jo kamjor karte hon, to is prakaar kaa pairon kaa tedha hona aage tak bhi bana rah saktaa he

 Presumably, it is induced by the upward current method
 sarvapratham 1847 i0 main england main, suviksit taar pranali kii sahaayta se parpati main parivartansheel vidyuddharaon kaa prekshan kiya gaya tha
 This inspired many researchers to study land currents
 bhu-dhaaraon or 'bhu-vaayu dhaaraon' ke sambandh main koi bhram nahin hona chahie
 Winds flowing from the Earth's surface to the Earth, or vice versa, are interpreted based on the Earth's potential area

 electrodon ke prayek jode ke bich voltata kaa antar kuch milivolton main hota he, jise upyukt vinduon par sthapit sookshmagrahi upkarnon se mapa jaataa he
 Since the properties of both the electrode and the soil in which they are buried are not common, it is necessary to use modifications of the contact difference between the electrodes and the soil to get an accurate value of the difference between any two electrodes
 
 yah bhi nishchit hona chahie ki electrodon par sampark pratirodh, abhilekhan-paripath ke pratirodh kii tulana main naganya he or samay bitne ke saath badalata nahin
 The grid of lead wire is often buried in wet soil to measure landforms

 There are two types of variation of land currents: inke anek lakshan chumbakeey vikshobh se milte julate hai
 The timing of the events of land currents, magnetic storms and polar lights are the same and their evolution is universal and simultaneous
 in donon sakriyataaon kaa 11 varshiya vicharan hota he, jo surya ke dhabbon kii sakriyata ke saath sangat hota he or isamen 27 divasiy aavruti kii pravriti bhi hoti he
 Similar to magnetic activation, local disturbances of the ground current occur at high intensity at high axes
 yah bhi vichaarneey he ki bhu-dhara ke abhilekhan chumbakeey vikshobh ke lagbhag samaantar hote hai or donon kii prakruti bhi ek si hoti he
 The above similarities point to the deep physical relationship of both events
 bhu-dhaaraon kaa ausat dainik vicharan, vibhav pravanta ke dainik madhyamaan se madhya vichlan ko prati ghante par aalekhith karne se praapt hota he
 They have the following similarities with the daily magnetic variations: The variations in the day are faster than at night
 jaadon kii tulana main garmi ke dinon main inkaa paraas adhik ucch hota he
 The observations above from Waterloo and Tusson's observatories give a clear conclusion
 uttari or dakshini golardhon main bhu-dhaaraon ke prekshanon se vishuvat ke nikat kala parivartan prakat hota he
 In the afternoon, the main flow of land current from both sides is towards the equinox
 neeche likhe tathyon se spasht ho jaataa he ki bhu-dhaaraon ke dainik vicharan tathaa parthiv chumbakatv main bhotik sambandh he: According to Rooney, Waterloo's magnetic force and the rate of diurnal variation of the ground currents are shown in the picture
 chitra main vakr a waterlu kii bhu-dhaaraon ke uttari avyav kaa dainik vicharan nirupit karata he or vakr ba usee sthaan ke kshaitij chumbakeey bal ke purvi avyav kaa kaal vyutpann he
 The entire linear curve in the figure indicates the variance of the eastern component of the magnetic force at that location
 chookin vakr a or ba lagbhag samaantar hai, at: inamen se kisi ek kaa jhukna a or ba se nirupit vicharanon kaa aakasmik sambandh bataata he1 yah samajhnaa asangat nahin he ki yadi sab nahin to adhikansh bhu-dharaayen parthiv chumbakeey balon main vicharanon ke kaaran prerit dharaayen hai
 Also there is the fact that other factors can also be helpful in the construction of this currents
 a or ba ke bich vyavasthit kala antar kaa hona prathit hota he
 An analysis of the data of the ground currents and their corresponding geomagnetic fields has shown that the centers are clear, with variations in the variance curve of the northward-oriented magnetic component, and not by the rate of time of variation of the northward-oriented magnetic component
 As it should be in that case when it arises out of the induced induced effect
 is asangati kaa sanket yah he ki bhu-dhara nikaay kaa mul utana saral nahin he, jitna chitra ke a or ba kii spasht samanta se prathit hota he
