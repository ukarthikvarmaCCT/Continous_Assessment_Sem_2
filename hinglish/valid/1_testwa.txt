 kaach kaa upyog aisi kai prakaar kii vasatuon main kiya jaataa he jinamein vibhinn bhautik gunon kii aavashyaktaa rahati he
 Variations in the physical properties of the kach can be brought about by different oxides
 bhautik gun kaach main upasthit prayek oxide kii aapekshik maatra par bhi nirbhar karata he
 Density- In kach, the highest density comes from sis oxide and the lowest by boric oxide
 vaidyut gun- kaach kii vidyucchalakata uski rachana, taap evam vaataavaran par nirbhar hoti he
 Nowadays, kach is also being used for dielectric
 tapiya gun- tapt karne par kaach prasaarit hota he, par boric oxide evam magnesium oxide ke kaach main nunatam prasar hota he or kshareey oxide se adhiktam prasar
 Heat conductivity - Kach is the least conductor of heat; Silica and boric oxide have lower heat conductivity in the sludge
 kaach ke anya bhautik gun, jaise yang kaa pratyasthata-gunank, tanaav shakti, dridhtaa tathaa tapiya sahansheeltaa, kaach main pade oxidon par nirbhar hote hai
 By studying the effect of these in the sludge, the chemical sludge, the heat-resistant slurry, which can be heated red and cooled completely in ice, and the thermometer sludge are produced

 is gun ke pareekshan ke liye kaach kii vastuon ko jal main vibhinn tapon tak garam kar barf se thande kiye gaye jal main achaanak dubo dete hai
 Pasteurization, cooking utensils, lamp chimneys, chemical slabs and thermometer hose, require high thermal tolerant grips
 kaach main adhik tapiya sahansheeltaa utpann karne ke liye silica kii maatra adhik or kshar kii maatra kam honi chahie tathaa kaach main kuch maatra main jasta oxide, boran oxide or aluminium oxide bhi hona chahie
 Optical properties- Optical properties in lenses, such as high alternation and deflection, are also dependent on the amount of different oxides in the glass and therefore reducing the amounts of sis oxide, barium oxide, and calcium to produce valuable swatches of particular frequency and deflection
 Can go parabangnee prakaash ke pargaman ke liye pardavashpadip kaa kaach kaachiya silica kaa banaaya jaataa he, kyonki ye rashmiyaan saadhaaran vyapaarik kaach ke paar nahin ja sakati he; parantu dravit quartz ke paar ye saralata se ja sakati hai
 Viscosity - Viscosity is also an essential property in the construction of wood, because the blast, grinding, traction, and rolling of the stick depend very much on the viscosity of the stick; Elimination of deformity is also directly related to viscosity
 kaach kii shyanta kaach ke oxide avyavon par nirbhar karti he
 Increasing the amount of silica increases the viscosity of the glass; Viscosity increases with the growth of lime, but viscosity-range is reduced
 soda kii maatra badhaane se shyanta ghatati he, par shyanta-paraas badhata he
 When the slurry object is heated, the outside surface becomes hotter than the inner parts and similarly when the heated liquid slime is cooled and solidified, the outer surface of the slab is more solid than the inside It gets cold

 Along with this disruption, public funds started being exploited by sly promoters due to lack of proper methods of this relationship

 The terror-stricken British Parliament passed the 'bubbles Act' in 1720 AD
 is adhinium ne dhoorttapurna samavaayon ke sanghathan par pratibandh lagane ke bajaay samavaayon ke pravartan ke vyavsaay ko hi avaidh qaraar de diya
 Although this act got fragmented in 1825 AD, however, registration and conference of major participants could be made compulsory only in 1844 AD

 Since then substantial amendments and reforms have been made in the Samvadhi Acts, whereas in 1948, we received the latest Act

 The key to its opening has been limited liability

 The history of company legislation in India is linked to the company legislation of England, as the British had ruled before August 15, 1947, and had created legislations in India on the basis of their will, the basis of which has been the British legislation
 19veen shatabdi ke madhya main san 1844 i
 main england main company sambandhi vidhaan paarit kiya gaya
 Similar legislation was made for India for the first time in 1850, the Joint Capital Companies Act
 is adhinium kii sabase badi kami yah thi ki isamen simit daayitv ke tatv ko manyata pradaan nahin kii gai
 In 1857, by passing the new Joint Capital Companies Act, the lack of limited liability was met to some extent
 san 1860 main nayaa company adhinium paarit kiya gaya jisamen bankig evam beemaa companiyon ko bhi simit daayitv kii chhot de di gai
 Due to the change in circumstances with time, the need for some new provisions was felt continuously in the Companies Act
 atah san 1860 ke baad san 1866, 1882, 1913 tathaa 1956 main ek ke baad ek naye adhinium bharat main british vidhaan main hone vaale parivartanon ke maddenjar paarit kiye jate rahe hai
 Section 3 of the Companies Act, 1956 defines the term 'company' as "a company or an existing company organized and registered under this Act
 " saamaanya vyakti ke liye 'company' shabd se taatpary ek vyavsaayik sanghathan se he
 But we also know that all types of business organizations cannot technically be called 'companies'
 bharat kaa saamaanya kanoon ekal swami ke nijee sansadhano ko, uske vyavsaay se pruthak nahin maanata
 As a result, in times of occupational crisis, his business loans are repaid from his personal resources

 In such a situation it is not appropriate for him to take such a risk
 atah vah apane vyavsaay ko ek nijee company ke rup main chalaane kaa nirnay kar saktaa he
 The status of a partner is even more risky
 saajhedaari kaa sambandh parsparik vishwaas par aadhaarit hota he
 If a partner misuses this trust, it can put other partners in serious trouble, because the liability of the partners is unlimited
 is aseemit daayitv ke jokhim se bachane ke liye saajhedaar swayan ko company adhinium ke antargat panjikrut kara sakate hai, kyonki us sthiti main prayek sadsy kaa daayitv uske dwaara liye gayi sheyaron ke mulya tak hi simit hota he
 Apart from the limitations of personal risk, there are many other reasons that may compel a group of individuals to form a corporate center under the Act, such as acquiring technical knowledge, obtaining policies with managerial qualifications
 , Huge capital, corporate personality, transferability of shares, etc
 company adhinium kii katipay paribhaashaayen nimnlikhit hai - The requirement of this Act is to improve the management of the companies and the methods of their functioning in such a way that a close relationship can be established between the promoters, the appropriators and the managers, thereby increasing the efficiency of the organization of the companies, matching the performance of the managers with the appropriate officers of the appropriations
 On the production and distribution of the interests of creditors, workers and other persons Yapt possible defense

 2) to control the portion of profit which is given to the managers in the form of remuneration for their services and to prohibit their behavior which may cause conflict in their interests and duties
 3) sanyukt skandh company ke nirmaan or prabandh par sarkaar kaa adhik niyantran hona, taaki companiyon kii raashiyon ko us ore jane se roka ja sake, jisase raashtra kii unnati main baadha padati ho

 8) To bring a level of good behavior and honesty in the enforcement and management of the company

 Solomon v
 Solomon and Samay, 1897 A
A
 In c
 22, the Sardar Sabha of Britain stressed the existence of an independent amalgamation of Samvayas
 shri solomon naamak ek vyakti ne ek samavaay kaa sanghathan kiya or usne us samavaay ke haath apana vyavsaay 40 hajaar pound main bech diya
 Instead of taking payment, he took a fraction of 20 thousand pounds worth and 10 thousand pounds worth of debentures
 chunki adhinium main is baat kii vyavastha rahi he ki kam se kam saat vyakti milakar hi koi loksamavaay kaa sanghathan kar sakate hai isliye ek vyakti ke parivaar ke shesh chah vyaktiyon ko ansh diya jaataa
 Therefore, a Samaj controlled by a person had to see bad days and in the end it collapsed
 samaapan ke samay us samavaay kii sthiti is prakaar thi- The argument was presented on behalf of the disqualified superlatives that although the samayas have been amalgamated, the samajya has never had an independent existence
 vah samavaay kya tha, swayan solomon ek duusare naam se maujuud the
 The business was entirely his own, so how could he excel in himself
 vah samavaay kritrim or dhokhe kaa putala tha
 Uttamarna wanted Solomon to be liable for equitable debts
 jo kuch bhi ho, nyaayalay ne apane nirnay main kaha ki 'jab gyaapak patr samuchit rup se hastakshrit or panjikrut ho jaataa he or yadhyapi saat hi ansh liye jate hai, tathaapi abhidaat samamelit sanghathan he or usamen tatkaal samamelit samavaay ke sabhi kartavyon ke prayog kii kshamta samahit ho jaati he
 It is difficult to understand how the corporation body thus formed by the Act loses its personality by giving most of the capital to only one person
 vidhi kii drushti main samavaay ek pruthak vyakti hota he jo gyapakapatr ke abhidaataaon se sarvatha bhinn hota he, tadnusaar solomon samavaay kaa uttamarn mana gaya or chunki vah pratibhoot uttamarn tha, usko anya uttamarnon kii apeksha praathamikta kaa adhikaar tha
 Secondly, it is the only amalgamated body that gives members the ability to do business with limited liability
 anshadaata samavaay ke rinon ke uttardaayitv ke liye baadhya nahin he
 If he does not pay his share money then he is only responsible for paying that money
 yadi uske ansh ke dhan kaa purna rup se bhugtan ho chukaa he tab uski deyta kaa prashn hi nahin uthta
 Expressing its view of limited liability facility, a Justice has said that 'no other law has possibly provided the benefits of limited liability regulations for the development of the country's commercial property
 simit deyta ne, jahaan tak viniyokta tathaa lok ke laabh kaa prashn he, chote mote ghanon kii badi poonji main parinat karne main protsaahan pradaan kiya he
 The wealth of the country only increases by using that big capital in the work of public welfare
 ' Thirdly, the parts of a compound are movable assets and are freely transferable
 atev samavaay kii sadsyta samay samay par parivartit hoti rahati he kintu is parivartan se swayan samavaay kii anavaratata par koi kharaab asar nahin padataa
 Samvay enjoys permanent succession
 kisi sadsy kii mrityu athwa divaaliepan se samavaay kii sthiti main koi antar nahin aata
 In addition, amalgamation has the ability to explicitly separate its members from the property of the group
 samavaay apane naam se mukadmaa lard saktaa he or uske naam se mukadmaa ladaa ja saktaa he

 Macdonald kavy main ek prakaar kaa arth dosha Definition: According to Acharya Mammatt, the main element of poetry is defect, the teacher
 Acharya Vishwanath Prasad has described the defect in the literature as saying "rasapakarshaka Dosh:"
 It is not logical to do
 70 faults are mentioned in poetic light, they are usually divided into five faults: - 1-verse defect 2- Verse verse 3- Sentence defect
 4- Earth Dosh 5- Ras Dosh grot rebar ko radio khagoliki kaa pitamah kaha jaataa he
 He was the first person who created a large dish antenna for mapping the sky at radio frequencies
 unhone anek vivikt radio sroton kii khoj kii tathaa hamaari aakaansh ganga - 'milky ve' se utsarjit hone vaale vibhinn radio utsarjanon par akashganga kaa maanchitran kiya
 He was a great astronomer and the helm of radio astronomy
 unhone karl jainsky ke mahaan khagoliki kaaryon ko aage badhaayaa tathaa pehali baar radio aavritiyon par akaash kaa surveykshan kiya
 Reber was born on December 22, 1911, in Hwyton, Illinois, and was raised here
 unhone armar institute of technology se 1933 main grajuation kiya tathaa radio ejineering kii oopaadhi praapt kii
 He was an amateur radio operator and between 1933 and 1947 he worked for several radio manufacturers
 1933 main jab unhen karl jainsky ke kaaryon ke vijaay main maaloom padaa to unhone mahasoos kiya ki yahi vah kshetra tha jisamen ve kaary karnaa chaahate the tathaa iske liye unhone bel lab main aavedan kiya jahaan par jainsky carpar rahe the
 It was a time of great disappointment and there were no jobs available at that time
 1937 ke greejamkaal main rebar ne apni swayan kii radio doorabeen banane kaa nirnay liya tathaa yah kaary unhone hviton main apane awaas ke pichhawaade karne kaa sochaa
 Reber's radio telescope was of a very high quality with a parabolic shape sheet metal mirror with a diameter of 9 meters that focused a radio receiver 8 meters above the mirror
 sampoorn darpan asembli ek jhukaawadaar stand par sthapit kii gai jisase isaki pointing vibhinn dishaao main kii ja saki
 This telescope was completed in 1937
 rebar ke pratham resiver ko 3300 megaherts par prachaalit kiya gaya tathaa isse bahya antariksh se signlon kaa sansuchan kiya ja sakaa
 Similarly, the receiver operating at 900 mhz was also unsuccessful
 ant main unhone 160 megahertz par resiver banaaya tathaa 1938 main isane safaltaapurvak kaary kiya
 In 1940, he made his first professional publication, but Reber refused to take up a research appointment at the Yerkies Observatory
 iske baad unhone radio aavriti akaash maanchitr banane kii ore dhyaan diya jise unhone 1941 main puraa kiya tathaa 1943 main ise or vistrut kiya
 During this period, he published considerable details of the research he had done and emerged as the initiator of radio astronomy
 is dauraan unhone khagoliki ke un rahasyon kaa pardaafash kiya jinka spashtikaran 1950 tak nahin diya ja sakaa tha
 The basic concept of space radio emission was that the reason for those emissions was 'black body radiation' which is a type of light emitted by all Krishna pinds
 lekin rebar ne yah siddh kiya ki iskaa ulta bhi satya he or nimna urja vaale radio signal kii paryaapt maatra uplabdh he
 It was discovered in 1950 itself that 'synroton radiation' for such ways is an explanation given to the radiation that is produced when charged particles are accelerated on a curved path)
 rebar ne apni doorabeen rashtriya maanak beuro ko bench di tathaa ise sterling main ek field stesan main sthapit kiya gaya
 Finally, the telescope reached the 'NRAO' observation school in West Virginia, and Reber guided its restoration to that new site
 rebar ne jainsky kii vaastavik doorabeen ke pun nirmaan ko bhi suparvij kiya
 From 1951, Reber received considerable support from the New York Research Corporation and went to Hawaii

 In 1954, Rebar moved to Tasmania, a triangular subcontinent on the coast of southern Austria
 yahan aakar unhone tasmania vishvavidhyalay main bill elice ke saath kaary kiya
 Here in the extremely cold and long autumn nights, the ionosphere was shielded from solar radiation for many hours and due to this it was shielded from solar radiation for many hours and due to that the antenna array of Rebar used to receive radio waves for a long time
 tasmania main maanav nirmit radio nvashek str bhi kaaphi kam tha jisase bahya antariksh se madhyam str ke signlon kaa abhigrahan aasaani se ho paata tha
 Groot Rebar did not believe in the 'bug bang concept' but rather believed on the Red Ship that the red shielding phenomenon was due to the repeated absorption and re-emission of light and other types of electromagnetic radiation by low density particulate matter
 yah parighatnaayen intaraa-galactic duriyon par hoti hai tathaa is par unhone ek shodh patr, 'andles, boundles, stebul univers antarahit, simaarahit, sthir brahmand) prakashit kiya
 He died on 20 December 2002 in Hobard, north-eastern of Tasmania
 rebar ko unke jivan kaal main anek anareri digriyan or award pradaan kiye gayi
 Some of these are: - grot rebar ke sammaan main anek chizon or sansthaaon ke naam unke naam ke saath rakhe gayi
 Some of these names are Asteroids 6886 Groot Rebar Medal started by the Groves of Groot Groot Rebar Foundation
 unke sammaan main mount plijaint radio prekshan shaala, cambridge main ek museum kholaa gaya

 An all-rounder is a cricketer who performs regularly in both batting and bowling
 haalanki sabhi gendbaajon ke liye ballebaaji jaruri hoti he or kuch ballebaaj kabhi-kabhaar gendbaaji bhi karte hai, zyaadaatar khilaadi in do chizon main se sirf kisi ek main hi nipun hote hai or ve visheshgy maane jate hai
 Some wicket-keepers have mastery of specialist batsmen and are also known as all-rounders, but the wicket-keeper batsman terminology is more commonly used for them
 mahanatam harfanmaulaa main jorge hurst, wilfred rods, mushtak mohammad, kith miller, garfield sobers, andrew flintoff, walter hamend, ian botham, jacks kallis, kapil dev, richard hadlee, dablyoo
 ji
 gres, kris kairns, shen watson, dwen braavo, imran khan or shahid aafridi kaa naam liya ja saktaa he
 However, there is no exact qualification for a player on the basis of which he is considered an all-rounder and the use of this name becomes subjective
 aamtaur par 'vaastavik harfanmaulaa' use kaha jaataa he jisaki ballebaaji yaa gendbaaji kshamta aisi ho jisase ki wo unamem se kisi ek dam par hi us dal main jagah banane main kaamyaab ho jiske liye wo khelte hai
 Another definition of 'real all-rounder' is that a player who, with his batting and bowling, constantly "helps his team win matches"
 paribhaasha ke mutabik ek vaastavik harfanmaulaa team ke liye behad durlabh or kaaphi moolyawaan khilaadi hota he kyonki wo prabhavi taur par do khilaadiyon ke rup main kaam karata he
 Sometimes confusion arises when an expert bowler performs well with the bat
 udhaaharan ke liye, west indies ke mahaan tej gendbaaj malcom marshall kai baar acchhee pari khelaa karte the, lekin ye itani baar nahin hota tha ki unhen harfanmaulaa mana jaae
 iske bajaae unhen nimna kram kaa acha ballebaaj kaha ja saktaa he
 Similarly, a specialist batsman can be called a useful change bowler and a good example of this is Alan Border, who took 11 wickets in a Test match once in 1989, when the conditions were favorable to his left-handed spin
 manyata praapt harfanmaulaa banane main pramukh baadhaon main se ek he ballebaajon or gendbaajon kaa alag-alag umr main shikhar par pahunchnaa
 ballebaaj tees saal ke aasapaas apane shikhar par tab pahunchate hai jab unki takneekee anubhav ke saath paripakv ho jaati he
 In contrast, fast bowlers often reach their peak in physical ability as well as in the course of twenty to twenty five years
 duusare gendbaaj, zyaadaatar phiraki gendbaajon or gend ko ghumaane vaale tej gendbaaj bhi apane kariyar ke aakhir main zyada asardaar hote hai
 a commonly used rule of statistics is that a player's batting average should be greater than his bowling average
 test cricket main, aise sirf teen harfanmaulaa hai jinka ballebaaji ausat unke gendbaaji ausat kii tulana main bees ank zyada hai: garfield sobers, jacks kallis or walter hamend
 haalanki, kuch duusare khilaadi bhi hai jinhone apane kariyar ke bade hisse tak yah uplabdhi hasil kii, jaise imran khan, steve wa, andru symonds or shen watasan
 daf walters ne ballebaaji ausat 48
26 or gendbaaji ausat 29
08 se apane ballebaaji or gendbaaji ausat main takreeban bees ran kaa antar hasil kar liya tha, baavjood iske ve aamtaur par kabhi-kabhaar gendbaaji karne vaale or saajhedaari todane vaale hi maane jate the, vaastavik harfanmaulaa nahin
 Overall, there are many cricketers in first-class cricket who have a very high batting average
 aankadon main bahut kam hi honge jo frank wooli ko chunauti de sakate hai jinka ballebaaji ausat 40
77 or gendbaaji ausat 19
87 tha
 Woolley has taken over 2000 wickets in his career, scoring more runs than any player except Jack Hobbs and is the only non-wicketkeeper to have caught more than 1000 catches
 kshetrarakshan kaushal kisi khilaadi kii harfanmaulaa kshamta kaa ek or mahatvapurn aadhaar mana jaataa he
 Apart from Woolley, other great fielders who are called all-rounders, W
W
 G
 Grace, Walter Hammond and Gary Sobers
 ye sabhi maidan par kaaphi chust kshetrarakshak or surakshit kaich lapakane vaale the
 Basically an all-rounder is better at bowling than batting, similarly batting is better than bowling
 bahut kam hai jo donon main hi achche hai or shaayad koi bhi nahin he jo donon main arshyachanak rup se behatar he
 This is the reason that the names "bowler allrounder" and "batsman allrounder" emerged
 udhaaharan ke liye, test cricket main kith miller kaa ballebaaji main 36
97 kaa ek acha ausat tha, or 22
97 kaa behtareen gendbaaji ausat tha, isliye unhen gendbaaj harfanmaulaa kaha jaataa he
 In contrast, Gary Sobers had a tremendous batting average of 57
78 and bowling average of 34
03, so he can be called a batsman all-rounder
 vaastavik harfanmaulaa main adarsh hai imran khan jinka ballebaaji main ausat 37 or gendbaaji main 23 kaa ausat tha, jo ek ballebaaj ke taur par bahut acha tathaa gendbaaj ke taur par behtareen he
 Sobers is considered the "greatest all-rounder of all time"
 Although statistics suggest, they were also much better in one area than the other
 unhen mukhyataur par ek mahaan ballebaaj or bahut achche gendbaaj ke taur par varnit kiya jaataa he
 His unique ability was that he could bowl medium fast bowling as well as spin balls from the wrists, while he actually joined the West Indies team as a finger ball bowler

 By 1886, Grace had achieved this kind of dual success eight times, and for the first time in 1882 another player achieved this double feat

 Sultan Muhammad Zaheer ud-din, commonly known as Mirza Mughal, was a Mughal prince =
 unhone 1857 ke bhartiya vidroh ke dauraan mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 He was one of the Mughal princes killed at a gate in Old Delhi, after which the gate became known as the "bloody Door"
 mirza mogul 12 wein or aakhri mughal samraat bahadur shah jafar kaa paanchvaan putr tha
 His mother, sharif-ul-mahal Sayyidini, came from an aristocratic Sayyid family that claimed descent from Hazrat Muhammad
 1856 main apane bade sautele bhai mirza fakhru ke maut ke baad, mirza mughal bahadur shah jafar ke sabase bade jivit vaid putr bane
 However, the British refused to recognize anyone as the heir to the throne of Delhi, and indicated that the monarchy would end after Zafar's death
 may 1857 main, british bhartiya sena ke sipaahi ne apane british adhikariyon ke khilaaf vidroh kiya or dilli main pravesh kiya
 He built directly for the palace, pitted the Emperor of the Emperors against his British superiors, confirmed his allegiance to him, and sought sanctuary and leadership
 kuch dinon baad, sthiti kaa bhandar lene ke baad, mirza mughal or unke kuch aadhe bhaaiyon ne vidrohi sainikon ke prabharee niyukt hone ke liye apane pita se anurodh kiya
 His petition was initially denied but later granted, and Mirza Mughal, as the senior-most legal prince, was named commander-in-chief
 mirza mughal ke paas apane nae karyaalay ke liye bilkul koi prashikshan yaa anubhav nahin tha
 However, he energetically sought to organize troops, to do his bidding and provision, and brought equality of order to the shore town
 unka anubhavheenata jald hi spasht ho gaya, or british hafte main ek purv gaiyr-kamishan adhikari, bakhtar khan ke bareli ke ek bade bal ke pramukh par, aagaman ke kuch hafte baad unhen uksaaya gaya, jinhone ek arjeet kiya tha afgaan yudhon ke dauraan acchhee pratishtha
 Shortly after his arrival, the Emperor appointed Bakhat Khan commander-in-chief and left Mirza Mughal in charge of supplies
 kuch hafte baad, karyaalayon ke ek or badlaav ke baad, mirza mughal ko dilli shahar kaa prashasan karne kaa prabhaar diya gaya
 By the middle of September 1857, the unorganized rebellion had its way as far as the city of Delhi was concerned
 british senaaon ne dilli se ghire ilaakon ke niyantran par punarvichaar kiya tha or shahar par antim hamale ke liye shahar ke najadik rij par chadhaaya gaya tha, jise apane nagarikon dwaara teji se tyaag diya ja rahaa tha, jo mukhya rup se gramin ilaakon main apane gaanvon main bhaag gaye the
 As the British took control of the city, Emperor Bahadur Shah II left the Red Fort and took refuge in Humayun's tomb, which was outside Delhi at the time
 unke saath mirza mogul or do anya rajkumaar the 
 His whereabouts were reported by detectives to Major Hodgson, who sent him a message that the party had no hope of escaping and should surrender
 unhone aatmasamarpan karne se inkaar kar diya
 The next morning, Hodgson went to the tomb with a hundred cavalry and demanded the unconditional surrender of the emperor and princes
 sthiti aas-paas ke gaanvon ke logon ke liye jaani jaati he, or ek badi bheed ikatthi hui, jinamein se kai saamaanya rup se rakhi gai bahon se susajjit the
 Resistance at this point was never the plan of the emperor, who had come to his glorious predecessor tomb to pray and mourn, and perhaps in the hope that the sanctity of the tomb would provide sanctuary for himself and his surviving family
 isliye unhone hodsan ko ek sandesh bheja ki vah apni party ke aatmasamarpan kii shart de rahe hai ki unke jivan or jindagi or bheed jo ab unhen gher leti hai
 Hodgson apparently agreed to this, stating only that a thick crowd of princes and villagers should surrender their arms immediately
 samjhauta kiya ja rahaa he, samraat, british sena adhikari ke rup main hodsan ke shabd par bharosa karte hue, makbare se ubhara or hodsan ke saath vyaktigat rup se badhai kaa aadan-pradaan kiya
 Finding the old man extremely weak with diligence, Hodgson admits the emperor to rest and refresh under a shady tree
 iske baad unhone rajkumaron ko dilli main waapas bhej diya, ek bail-gaadi main savaar hokar, das ghudsavaar british sainikon ke anurakshan ke saath
 Meanwhile, the remaining ninety soldiers gathered the arms of a thick crowd of villagers, who surrendered their weapons without dissent at the bid of their emperor
 iske turant baad, samraat ke saath surakshit lekin spasht rup se shahar main pahunchaae jane kii sthiti main, hodsan ne sainikon kii ek choti party ke saath shahar ke liye baahar niklaa
 Riding on horses, they were soon caught up with a party carrying princes
 jaise hi unhone shahar ke dwaaron se sampark kiya, hodsan ne paaya ki samraaton or rajkumaron kii vaapasi kii ummid main kasbon kii bheed ikatthi hui thi
 Also, due to the princes, crowds of eager villagers had traveled a few miles to the gates of Delhi
 yah suzav diya gaya he ki bheed ko dekhne par hodsan ne apana tantrika kho diya
 Others have suggested that the presence of the crowd suggested to them that this was an appropriate area in which to send a clear message to the Indians and demonstrate the power and brutality of the British
 phir bhi dusron ne suzav diya he ki hodsan ne puraane samraat ke saath bure vishwaas main samjhauta kiya tha or unhone kabhi bhi apana vachan rakhane kaa iraadaa nahin rakhaa tha
 In all events, an idea which violates a serious agreement, which he had made a few minutes earlier, at his word of honor as an officer of the British army, to an old man greatly respected by these people, of raising it The prestige of the British, instead, was clearly beyond Hodgson's ken
 shahar ke dwaar par, hodsan ne teen rajkumaron ko gaadi se utarane kaa aadesh diya
 They were then stripped of their upper garments
 bheed kii spasht drushti main nange chaati vaale rajkumaron ko rekhaankit kiya gaya tha
 Hodgson then took his gun and shot himself at three pointless and half-naked princes at point-blank range
 rajkumaron kii hatya ke baad, hodsan ne vyaktigat rup se aabhushanon ke apane sharir ko tod diya, signal ke challe, firoza haath-band or teen rajkumaron dwaara pahane hue beoweld talavaarein
 They pocketed these valuables as trophies of war, although they were obtained by killing exiled prisoners of war under suspicious circumstances
 teen rajkumaron ke nikaayon ko waapas bail-gaadi main phenk diya gaya tha, jo shahar ke bheetar kotwali le jaaya gaya tha, us imaarat ke saamne jameen par phenk diya gaya tha or vahaan se baahar nikalne ke liye vahaan ujagar hua tha
 The gate near which executions were carried out is known as Khooni Darwaza which means "blood gate" or "blood gate" or "death gate"

 Java is a programming language originally developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of the Java platform of Sun Microsystems
 bhashaa apana adhikansh vaakya vinyas c or C++ se praapt karti he lekin iske paas ek saral object model or kuch nimna str kii suvidhaayen maujuud hai
 Java experiments are typically compiled for bytecode that can be started on any Java virtual machine with any computer architecture
 1995 se san dwaara mul tathaa sandarbh karyanvayan java sankalkon, virtual mashiinon or class librariyon ko viksit kiya gaya
 As of May 2007, Sun made most of its Java technologies available as free software under the GNU General Public License, with special mention of the Java Community Process
 Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Classpath and the GNU Compiler for Java
 june 1991 main james goseling ne apane kai set-top box pariyojnaon main se kisi ek pariyojna main upyog karne ke liye java bhashaa pariyojna ko prarambh kiya
 The name of this language was formerly oak, which was named after an oak tree outside Gosling's office
 iske baad iskaa naam green bhi padaa or ant main iskaa naam java padaa
 yah java naam krambaddh shabdon kii ek suchi main se liya gaya
 Gosling aimed to introduce a virtual machine and a language that is familiar with c / c ++ style methodology
 1995 main san ne java 1
0 ke rup main pehla saarvajanik karyanvayan release kiya
 It promised "right Once, Run Anywhere", offering no-cost run-time on popular platforms
 paryaapt sudrudh or samanurupayogy suraksha prakat karte hue isane network or file acces ke pratibandhon ko anumati de di
 Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within webpages, and Java soon became well-known
 java 2 ke aagaman ke saath naye bhashaantaron main bahu akruti thi jo vibhinn prakaar ke platformon ke liye nirmit thi
 For example, J2EE targeted for enterprise applications and the most recent version J2ME for mobile applications
 J2SE targeted the standard version
 2006 main, vyaper ke uddeshy se san ne J2 ke naye varsano kaa naam badalakar kramash: java EE, java ME or java SE kar diya
 In 1997, Sun Microsystems sent a proposal to the ISO / IEC JTC1 Standards Committee to implement Java and later to ACMA International, but soon withdrew from the process
 java samudaay prakriya dwaara niyantrit java vastav main ek di phacto maanak bana hua he
 Despite its status as a software owner, Sun once provided most of the Java implementation at no charge
 Sun profited from Java by selling licenses to specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System
 Sun made a distinction between its software development kit and runtime environment); Primary differences include jre's lack of compilers, utility programs, and header files
 13 navambar 2006 ko, san ne GNU general public license ke sharton ke adheen adhikansh java ko swatantra or mukt strot software ke rup main release kiya
 On May 8, 2007, Sun ended the process, making all of Java's core code available under free software / free-source distribution terms, except for a small piece of code that Sun does not own
 java bhashaa ko nirmit karne ke paanch mukhya uddeshy the: Although most of Java's direct profits come from licensing and JCP subscription funds, some believe that Java is primarily a vehicle for hardware server promotion and / or sales of Solaris OS for Sun internally, and Sun's vice president Rich Green Said that Sun's ideal role for Java is similar to "evangelism"
 java kii ek visheshta vahniyata he, jiskaa matlab he ki java bhashaa main likhe gaye computer program kisi bhi hardware samarthit / oparating system plateform par samaan rup se kaary karata he
 This is achieved by compiling the Java language code, not from machine code, but from Java bytecode, - the instruction conforms to the machine signal but would be intended to be interpreted by a virtual machine written specifically for host hardware
 and-yuzars saamaanya taur par staneylon prayog mashin / yaa java aplates ke liye web broujar main java rantime envyranment kaa istemaal karte hai, jo unke swayan ke mashin par santhaapit he
 Standardized libraries provide a functional way to access host-specific features such as: graphing, threading and networking
 bitcode ko istemaal karne kaa sabase mukhya laabh he vahanta
 jo kuch bhi ho, bhashaantaran ke upree bhaag kaa matlab hota he ki bhashantarit programs hameshaa mul nishpadanyogy se sankalit programs se zyada dhire chalati hai or bure pradarshan ke kaaran java kii saakh ko nuksaan hota he
 Recently, with the introduction of several optimization techniques in JVM implementation, this problem has been reduced slightly
 san microsystems aadhikarik taur par java maanak sanskaran plateform Linux, Mac OS x or Solaris ke liye license detii he
 haalanki, purv main san ne Microsoft ko java license diya, license kii avadhi samaapt ho chuki he or iskaa phir se naveekaran nahin kiya gaya he
 Through a network of third-group vendors and licensees, alternative Java environments are available for it and other platforms
 java brands kaa upyog karne ke liye san kaa trademark license dridhtaapurvak kahata he ki sabhi kriyanvayan 'upyukt' ho
 This resulted in a legal dispute with Microsoft when Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support RMI and JNI and had additional platform-specific features of its own
 san ne 1997 main abhiyog chalaaya or 2001 main 20 million dollar kaa bhugtan or saath hi saath san ke license kii sharto ko lagu karne kaa court kaa aadesh bhi paaya
 As a result, Microsoft did not run Java for long with Windows, and in recent versions of Windows, Internet Explorer cannot support Java applets without third-party control
 Sun and others provided a free Java run-time system for that and other versions of Windows
 java EE ranneeti ke liye plateform-swatantra java aavashyak he or yahaan tak ki kriryanvayan ko pramanit karne ke liye or sakht vaidhikaran jaruri he
 Using the embedded Java environment, this environment enables portable server-side applications such as web services, servlets and enterprise javabeans, as well as embedded systems based on osgi
 glassfish pariyojna ke dwaara san java EE praudyogiki kaa purna sanchalit, ekikrut mukt strot karyanvayan ke liye kaary kar rahaa he
 Sun also distributes a superset of JRE called Java Development Kit, which includes development tools such as Java Compiler, Javadoc, Jar and Debugger
 java program ke pradarshan kaa iske samatuly multah sankalit bhashaa main likhe gaye program se tulana karnaa kathin he kyonki java ke bitcode compiler kaa target plateform, java plateform hi he or bitcode JVM dwaara mashin code main yaa to bhashantarit kar diya jaataa he yaa sankalit kar diya jaataa he
 These two different approaches: static vs
 dynamic compilation and recompilation and comparing other generated scenarios are very difficult and different
 sankalit bhashaaon main likhe prograamon kii tulana main java main likhe prograamon kaa dhimaa hona or adhik memory kii aavashyaktaa hona ek visheshta rahi he
 However, the implementation speed of Java programs has increased rapidly with the advent of just-in-time compilation, additional language features that support improved code analysis, and self-optimization in Java virtual machines
 object jivan chakra main smriti kaa prabandhan karne ke liye java ek swachaalit kachra sangrahakarta kaa upyog karata he
 The programmer determines when the object will be created and the Java runtime has the responsibility to recover its memory once the object is no longer usable
 ek baar jab object kaa koi sandarbh baaki nahin rahata, tab agamya object sangraahak dwaara swatah mukt hone ke yogya ho jaataa he
 Something similar to a memory leak can persist if a programmer's code catches a reference to an object that is no longer needed, similarly when objects that are no longer needed are stored in a container that is still Is in use agar astitvaviheen object ke liye paddatiyon ko bulaayaa jaataa hai, ek "nal pointer excepshan" phenkaa jaataa he
 One idea behind Java's automated memory management model is that programmers reduce the burden of performing regular memory management
 In some languages, memory for object creation is allocated or explicitly allocated on the stack and reallocated from the stack
 har tarah se smriti prabandhan kii jimmedaari programmer ke saath rahati he
 If the program does not reallocate an object, a memory leak occurs
 agar kaarykram smriti kaa abhigaman yaa punah aavantit karne kaa prayaas karata he jo pehle hi punahavantit kiya ja chukaa he, tab parinaam kaa anumaan lagaana or vyakhya karnaa mushkil ho jaataa he or kaarykram sambhawatah yaa to asthir or / yaa to samaapt ho jaataa hai
 This can be partially rectified using smart signals but it increases overhead and complexity
 kachra sangrahan kisi bhi samay ho saktaa he
 Ideally this will happen when the program is empty
 agar nae object ko aavantit karne ke liye swatantra smriti aparyaapt he tab iskaa chalaaya janaa nishchit he, yah kshambhar ke liye ek kaarykram sthapit karne kaa kaaran ban saktaa he
 Explicit memory management is not possible in Java
 java c / C++ style suchak ankaganit ko samarthan nahin karata he, jahaan par object adress or achinhit intigers ko adla-badali karke upyog kiya ja saktaa hai
 This allows the garbage collector to move the referenced objects and ensure its safety and security
 jaisaa ki C++ or kuch duusare object-unmukh bhashaaon main, java ke parivartaneey praathmik prakaar object nahin he
 The utility of the primary types is stored either directly in the fields or on the stack and not on the stack, as is generally true for objects
 java ke dijainron dwaara pradarshan ke kaaran liya gaya yah ek sajag nirnay tha
 Because of this, Java was not considered a pure object-oriented programming language
 jo kuch bhi ho, jaisaa ki java 5
0, swatah sanchaalan programmers ko aage badhane ke liye sakasham banaata he agar praathmik prakaarein unke aavaran shreniyon ke udhaaharan hote hai
 The syntax of Java is mostly derived from c ++
 C++, jisamen banaavat, kriyavidhi or kaarykram vaakya vinyas ko jodatii hai usase alag java ko keval ek object-unmukh bhashaa ke rup main banaaya gaya tha
 All the code is written within a class and everything is an object; Except for types of intrinsic data, which are not classes for performance reasons
 java kai visheshtaon ko claason ke liye, chhupaati he aisa vah bhashaa ko saral banane or swaabhaavik trutiyon or anadarsh rachana ko rokane ke liye karti he
 Java uses a review method similar to c ++
 do vibhinn prakaar kii samikshaayen hai: ekarekheey style ankan do forward slashes ke saath or ek bahurekhiy style khuli forward slash esterisk ke saath or band ek esterisk forward slash ke saath
 Examples: paramparanusaar 
java pratyay lagaakar udhaahranswarup helloworld
java strot filon kaa namakaran public class hota he
 It should be compiled into a bytecode using the Java compiler, first by producing a file named helloworld
class
 uske baad hi ise karyanvit yaa "nishpadit" kiya ja saktaa he
 The Java source file may contain only one public class but may contain fewer multiple classes than public access and any number of public inner classes
 ek class jise private ghoshit kiya ja chukaa he, use kisi bhi 
java file main sangrahit kiya ja saktaa he
 The compiler will generate a class file for each class defined in the source file
 class file kaa naam class kaa naam he, 
class sanlagnit ke saath
 class file peedhee ke liye, namarahit claason is tarah prabandhit hoti hai jaise ki unka naam unke sanlagnit class ke naam kaa sangyojan tha, ek $, or ek purnank
 The key word public indicates that a system can be invoked by code in other classes, or classes can be used by classes outside the class hierarchy
 class padanukram nirdeshika ke naam se sambandhit hota he jisamen java file rahata he
 The key word next to a system static refers to a positional system that is only associated with the class, not any other specific instance of that class
 sirf sthitik pranaliyaan kisi object ko sandarbh kiye bina aamantrit kii ja sakati hai
