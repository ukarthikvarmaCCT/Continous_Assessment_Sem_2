 It was decided to divide Bengal of India into two parts for the purpose of creating a Muslim majority province
 vibhaajan 16 oktober 1905 se prabhavi hua
 In history it is also known as Bangabhang
 yah angrejon kii "foot daalo - raaj karo" vaali niti kaa hi ek ang tha
 Therefore, in 1908 AD, the 'bang-bhang' movement started in protest against it
 is vibhaajan ke kaaran utpann ucch stareey raajnneetik ashaanti ke kaaran 1911 main dono taraf kii bhartiya janata ke dabaav kii vajah se bengal ke purvi evam pashchimi hisse punah ek ho gaye
 The area of bengal province was 489,500 square kilometers and the population was more than 8 crore
 purvi bengal bhugolic rup se evam kam sanchaar sadhano ke kaaran pashchimi bengal se lagbhag alag-thalag tha
 In 1836, the Upper Provinces were brought under the rule of a Lieutenant Governor and in 1854 the Governor general-in-council was relieved of the direct administration of Bengal
 alag chif-kamishnarship banane ke liye 1874 main assam ko silahat sahit, bengal se alag kar diya gaya or baad main 1898 main lushai hills ko bhi isamen shaamil kar diya gaya
 It was very difficult to manage a large and so populous province like Bengal
 sarvapratham 1903 main bengal ke vibhaajan ke bare main sochaa gaya
 Additional proposals were also proposed to merge Chittagang and the districts of Dhaka and Mamansingh from Bengal to Assam
 isi prakaar chota nagpur ko bhi kendriya praant se milaayaa janaa tha
 The 19th session of the Congress was also held in Madras in 1903

 He said that such a conspiracy is going on
 sarkaar ne aadhikarik taur par 1904 kii janvari main yah vichaar prakashit kiya or farvari main lord karzan ne bengal ke purvi jilon main vibhaajan par janata kii raay kaa akalan karne ke liye adhikarik daure kiye
 He consulted with prominent personalities and made speeches in Dhaka, Chittagong and Mamansingh and tried to explain the government's stand on partition
 henry jon stedman coton, jo ki 1896 se 1902 ke bich assam ke mukhya ayukta the, ne is vichaar kaa virodh kiya
 Speaking from the post of Chairman in the next session of Congress, Sir Henry Cotton also said that if there is an excuse that such a large province cannot be handled by a governor, then either the governing council of Bengal, like Bombay and Madras, will be in the vicinity of the Governor or Bengali
 Speakers should be separated and made a province
 un dinon bengal praant main bihar or urisa bhi shaamil the
 But the British government neither cared for Congress nor did it hold public opinion
 us samay ke vysarai or governor general lard karjan ne land holders association yaa jameendaar sabha main logon ko yah samajhane kii cheshtaa kii ki vangbhang se laabh hi hoga
 He himself went to East Bengal too, but none other than a handful of Muslims supported this proposal
 musalamaanon main pratishthit dhaka ke tatkaaleen nawab ne bhi pratham aavesh main iskaa virodh kiya tha
 Bengal was partitioned in 1905 on 16 October by Lord Curzon, the then Voice Rai of India
 vibhaajan ko prashaskeey kaaryon ke liye protsaahit kiya gaya, bengal lagbhag france jitna bada tha jabaki uski aabaadi france se kahin adhik thi
 It was thought that the eastern region was neglected and not properly governed
 praant ke bantwaare se poorviy kshetra main behatar prashasan sthapit kiya ja saktaa tha jisase antat vahaan kii janata skool or rojgaar ke maukon se labhanvit hoti
 However, other motives were also hidden behind the plan of partition
 bengali hindu, shashan main adhik se adhik bhagidaari ke liye rajnatik andolan main agrani the, atah ab purv main muslimon kaa varchasv badhane se unki sthiti kamjor ho rahi thi| hindu or muslim dono hi ne vibhaajan kaa virodh kiya| vibhaajan ke baad, haalaanki, lagbhag rashtriya str par british virdohi andolan prabal hua jisamen ki ahimsak or hinsak virodh pradarshan, bahishkaar or yahan tak ki pashchim bengal ke nae praant ke rajyapal kii hatya kaa prayaas bhi shaamil tha
 On 20 July 1905 Vangabhang's proposal was struck down by the Secretary of India, despite strong public opposition
 rajshahi, dhaka tathaa chatagaanv kamishnariyon ko assam ke saath milakar ek praant banaaya gaya, jiskaa naam purvavang or assam rakhaa gaya or baaki hissaa yani presidensi or vardhaman kamishnariyaan bihar, ud or iskaa koi aadhaar tha
 On this occasion, Hindus and Muslims were tried to fight, saying that this division would benefit the Muslims as they would have a majority in the East and Assam
 dhaka ke nawab ne pehle virodh kiya tha, par jab vangbhang ho gaya to vah uske paksh main ho gaye
 Sir Joseph Bamfield Fuller became the former and the new Lieutenant Governor of Assam
 kaha jaataa he, unhone kai jagah khullamakhulla kaha ki hindu or musalmaan unki do bibiyaan hai, inamen se musalmaan unki chaheti hai
 The meaning of this statement was clear
 vangbhang kaa uddeshy prashasan kii suvidha utpann karnaa nahin tha, jaisaa daawa kiya gaya tha, balki iske do spasht uddeshy the, ek hindu musalmaan ko ladaana or duusare navjaagrath bengal ko chot pahunchaana
 If seen in depth, it was the seed planting of Pakistan from here
 muslim lig ke 1906 ke adhiveshan main jo prastaav paas hue, unamem se ek yah bhi tha ki vangbhang musalamaanon ke liye acha he or jo log iske viruddh andolan karte hai, ve galat kaam karte hai or ve musalamaanon ko nuksaan pahunchaate hai
 Later, in the 1908 session of the League, it was also passed that the proposal of the Congress to oppose Vangabhang was not worthy of acceptance
 nae praant main pahari rajya tripura, chittagong mandal, dhaka or rajshahi shaamil hue or malda jile ko assam praant main mila diya gaya
 Bengal not only had to leave these large eastern states, but also five Hindi-speaking states had to be lost to the Central province
 pashchim kii taraf se ise madhya praant se sambalpur or paanch chote oriya-bhashi rajya pradaan kiye gaye
 Bengal had an area of 141,580 square miles and a population of five crore forty lakhs, of which four crore twenty lakhs were Hindus and ninety million Muslims
 nae praant kaa naam kramshah purvi bengal or assam tha jisamen purvi bengal kii rajdhani dhaka or assam kaa adhinsth mukhyalay chittagong tha
 Its area was 106,540 square miles and the population was thirty million, of which one crore eight million Muslims and one crore twenty lakh Hindus
 prashasan ke liye vahaan ek vidhaan parishad tathaa ek dwi-sadasyeey rajasav board tha or kalakatta ucch nyaayalay ke adhikaar-kshetra ko badla nahin gaya tha
 The government pointed out that there would be a properly defined western border between East Bengal and Assam and would have well-defined geographical, necrological, linguistic and social features
 bharat sarkaar ne apana antim nirnay 19 july 1905 ke sweekrut prastaav se prachaarit kiya or bengal kaa vibhaajan usee varsh 16 oktober se lagu ho gaya
 Before its abolition in 1911, the division lasted barely half a decade

 In 1919, separate electoral system was established for Muslims and Hindus

 Now, individual communities developed their own political issues
 muslimon ne bhi apni samgr sankhyatmak shakti ke bal par, jo ki mote taur par do karod bees lakh se do karod assi lakh ke bich thi, vidhanmandal main varchasv hasil kiya
 The demand for the creation of two independent states for Hindus and Muslims at the national level began to arise, with most Bengali Hindus now favoring the partition of Bengal on the basis of Hindu majority area and Muslim majority area
 muslim ab puure praant ko muslim rajya, pakistan kaa hissaa bananaa chaahate the
 Bengal split for the second time in 1947, this time on religious grounds
 yah purvi pakistan ban gaya
 However, East Pakistan became an independent state called Bangladesh in 1971 after a successful liberation war with Western Pakistani military rule
 bengal ke donon vibhaajanon main raktapaat hua
 This created a major political crisis
 purvi bengal main muslimon kii dharna thi ki ek alag kshetra unhen shiksha, rojgaar aadi ke adhik avasar uplabdh karaayega, jabaki pashchimi bengal ke logon ko yah bantwaaraa pasand nahin aayaa or is samay ke dauraan badi maatra main rashtravaadi sahitya kii rachana kii gayi
 The protest by the Indian National Congress was led by Sir Henry John Stedman Cotton, formerly the Chief Commissioner of Assam, but Curzon remained unmoved
 baad main coton ne, jo ab purvi naatingham ke udaaravaadi saansad ban gaye the, sar bempfield fuller, jo purvi bengal ke pehle leftinent-governor the, ko nikaalane ke abhiyaan kaa safalataa purvak sanchaalan kiya
 In 1906 Rabindranath Tagore composed Amar Shonar Bangla, the rally slogan of those who opposed partition, became the national anthem of Bangladesh in 1972
 in raajnneetik virodhon ke kaaran, bengal ke donon bhaag 1911 main phir se jud gaye the
 a new partition took place that divided the province on linguistic lines in place of religious, thereby separating the Hindi, Oriya and Assamese speaking areas into new administrative units
 iske saath hi saath british bharat kii prashasnic rajdhani ko kalakatta se nai dilli le jaaya gaya
 However, the conflict between Muslims and Hindus resulted in the creation of new laws to satisfy the political needs of both classes
 bangbhang ke viruddh bengal ke baahar bahut baari andolan hua
 Famous poets and litterateurs played an important role in this movement
 is andolan ne bankimchandra chattopadhyaay ke vande maataram geet ko nai bulandiyaan pradaan kii
 At that time the English cycle of dividing Bengal was broken, it gained extraordinary fame all over the country and abroad
 german or canada jaise desh bhi isse prabhavit hue
 'vande Mataram' was inscribed on the flag of a ship named Kamagatamaru

 In 1845, Gustav Kirchhoff gave two rules regarding voltage and current in electric circuits
 ye dono niyam sanyukt rup se kirchof ke paripath ke niyam kehalaate hai
 These rules are actually different forms of charge protection and energy conservation rules for electric circuits
 ye niyam vaidyut ejiniyari se sambandhit gananaaon ke aadhaar hai or bahutayat main prayog hote hai
 Both of these rules can be derived directly from Maxwell's equations, but history has it that Kirchhoff proposed them before Maxwell

 These voltages can also be complex numbers

 The power circuit shown in front has 2 voltage sources and 3 resistors

 yah ladaai paigambar mohammad ke navaase hazrat imam hossain ebn ali ke samarthakon or rishtedaaron ke ek chote samooh ke or umayyad atyachari shaasha yajid pratham kii ek badi sainya algaav ke bich hui thi
 The battle of Karbala is a very important event in human history
 yah sirf ek ladaai hi nahin balki jindagi ke sabhi pahaluon kii maarg darshak bhi he
 The foundation of this battle was laid after the demise of Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa
 imam ali a0 kaa caliph bananaa kuch adharmee logo ko pasand nahin tha to kai ladaiyaan huin ali a0 ko shahid kar diya gaya, to unke pashchaat hazrat imam hasan ebn ali a0 khalipha bane unako bhi shahid kar diya gaya
 Yazid, the ruler of the time, is believed to be wicked and cruel and used to do un-islamic work under his rule, the people of Iraq and Kufa wrote Hazrat Imam Hussein several letters and asked him to come to Kufa so that he could get the bait in his hands
 By making him their caliph, Yazid wanted Hussein to be with him, he knew that if Hussein came with him, all Islam would be in his grasp
 lakh dabaav ke baad bhi hossain ne uski kisi bhi baat ko maanane se inkaar kar diya, to yajid ne hossain ko rokane kii yojana banaai
 On May 4, 680 AD, Imam Hussein left his home in Medina and reached the city of Makke, where he intended to perform Haj, but came to know that the enemies could come and disguise the Hajis
 hossain ye nahin chaahate the ki kaaba jaise pavitra sthaan par khun bahe, phir imam hossain ne haj kaa iraadaa badal diya or shahar kufe kii ore chal die
 On the way, an army of enemies surrounded them and brought them to Karbala
 imam hossain ne karbala main jis jameen par apane kheme lagaae, us jameen ko pehle imam hossain ne kharida, phir us sthaan par apane kheme lagaae
 Yazid continued to pressurize Imam Hussain through his chiefs to accept Hussain, when Imam Hussain did not obey Yajid's conditions, the enemies finally put a guard of the army on the canal and prevented Hussain from entering the camps
 Has been applied yajid kii fouj ko dekh kar kufa iraq ke log jinhone imam hossain ko bulaayaa tha apana khalipha banane ke liye unhone ne bhi saath chhod diya
 After three days passed, when the children of the Imam's family started thirsting, Husain asked for water from the Yazidi army, the enemy refused to give water, the enemies thought that Imam Husain would break with thirst and accept all our conditions
 jab hossain teen din kii pyaas ke baad bhi yajid kii baat nahin maane to dushmano ne hossain ke khemon par hamale shuru kar die
 After this, Imam Hussein asked the enemies for one night and that whole night Imam Hussein and his family prayed to Allah and prayed that my family, my friends may be martyred, but Allah’s poor 'islam', which Nana came with him, he was saved
 10 oktober, 680 i

 pustaken vitarit karne ke liye ‘sarvice point’ taiyaar kiye gayi he, jo logon kii maansik sthiti kaa adhyayan or kshetreey aavashyaktaa ke anusaar pustaken mangaate or logon ko padhaate he
 Today the situation is different but there was a day when the need of libraries was felt in India in the same way as all the progressive countries have experienced today
 yahan gramin pustakaalayon ke atirikt chalate phirte pustkaalay bhi hote the
 Mystical saints used to have stock of handwritten books with social reformers
 ve jahaan bhi jate the logon ko in gyaan-deepon kaa prakaash diya karte the
 Social activism was alive due to the constant inspiration from libraries
 anushaasan tha, saamaajikta thi, kartavya paalan ke bhav the, paanditya tha, darshan tha or vah sab kuch tha, jo aaj kinhin vaan evam technology main unnat deshon main uplabdh he
 Nalanda and Taxila libraries are still famous in the state treasury libraries

 For the most important scheme like library, a total of 15 lines of 630 pages of the third five-year plan have been found
 yahi kaaran he ki 22 varshon kii swadhinata ke baad bhi bharatvarsh kii pragati ke aankade kachhue kii gati se bad rahe he
 There are good arrangements for some education in cities, there is also a library, but five and a half million villages are zero in the light of knowledge
 inamen rahane vaale graminon main aaj saahas he na manobal, gyaan he na buddhi, vivek he na samuchit mahatvakankshayen
 The need to agitate the mass conscience surrounded by superstition, conservatism, social evils remains incomplete
 har shikshit vyakti kaa yah uttardaayitv hota he ki vah sansar ko acha banane kaa praytn kare
 But in front of us, the responsibility to be good on our own today is very much
 yadi ise hi puraa kar len bahut he
 Turning the pages of history and penetrating into the depths of the people's revolution shows that the aspirations of the nation's rise will be fulfilled by libraries

 This responsibility belongs to the educated, they will also have to fulfill it

 ahmadiya samudaay ke log swayan ko musalmaan maanate va kehete hai parantu ahmadiya samudaay ke atirikt shesh sabhi muslim virgo ke log inhen musalmaan maanane ko haragij taiyaar nahin
 The reason for this is that while the Ahmadiyya community appears to be Muslims in Allah, Quran Sharif, Namaz, Beard, Topi, Talks and Accents etc
 the people of this community according to their historical beliefs, traditions and the teachings and information they have inherited, Hazrat Mohammad Does not accept his last prophet
 iske bajaae is samudaay ke log maanate hai ki nabdat kii parampara ruki nahin he balki satat jari he
 People of the Ahmadiyya sect consider their present supreme religious leader as a prophet

 In this way, it acts as a bridge between service seekers and service providers

 Today public relations is considered an essential part of building the credibility of any organization
 sarkaron ke alaava nijee sansthaaen bhi jansampark ke madhyam se apni saakh banane kaa kaary karti he
 Public relations is called a work in a nutshell, which is appreciated by the public, the first element of public relations is good performance
 kisi sanghathan yaa kisi sanstha kaa janata ke saath jo sambandh banataa he, use jansampark badhata he, achche jansampark main sachai or eemaandaaree honi chahie
 The process of public relations is different from the process of advertising or sales promotion, because the desired information is not exaggerated but presented in its actual form but effectively
