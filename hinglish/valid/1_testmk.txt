 Nathuram Vinayak Godse, or Nathuram Godse, was a staunch Hindu nationalist supporter who shot and killed Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on 30 January 1948 in New Delhi
 godse, rashtriya swayamsevak sangh ke pune se purv sadsy the
 Godse believed that Gandhi had supported the Muslim side of India and Pakistan at the time of partition of India
 jabaki hinduon par ho rahe atyaachaar par apni ankhen moond lee thi
 Godse together with Narayan Apte and 6 people had planned this massacre
 ek varsh se adhik chale mukaddame ke baad 8 navambar 1949 ko unhen mrityudand pradaan kiya gaya
 Although the arguments of exchange were offered by Gandhi's sons, Manilal Gandhi and Ramdas Gandhi, those arguments were turned down by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Maharajyapal Chakraborty Rajagopalachari and Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel
 15 navambar 1949 ko godse ko ambala jail main phaansi de di gai
 Nathuram Godse was born on 19 May 1910 in the Chittapavan Marathi family at the Baramati salt place near Pune in the state of Maharashtra, India
 inke pita vinayak vamanrav godse post aphis main kaam karte the or mata lakshmi godse ek gruhani thim
 The birth name of Nathuram was Ramachandra
 inke janm se pehle inke mata-pita kii santaanon main teen putron kii alpakaal main hi mrityu ho gayi thi keval ek putree hi jivit bachi thi
 Therefore, his parents, considering the curse on the life of male children, had prayed to God that if there is a son now, he will be raised like a girl
 isi manyata ke kaaran balak ramchandra kii naak bachapan main hi chhidava diya gaya or manyata anusaar ramchandra ko baalkaal main apane naak main ek nath
 Because of this, the boy Ramchandra was called as Nathuram
 brahman parivaar main janm hone ke kaaran nathuram kaa bachapan se hi dharmik kaaryon main gahari ruchi thi
 According to his younger brother Gopal Godse, he used to speak such strange verses in his mind during his childhood which he had never read
 dhyanavastha main ye apane parivaar waalon or unki kuladevi ke madhya ek sutara kaa kaary kiya karte the parantu yah sab 16 varsh tak kii aayu tak aate-aate swat: samaapt ho gaya
 Although he had his initial education in Pune, he left his schooling in the middle of high school and did not take any formal education thereafter
 dharmik pustakon main gahari ruchi hone ke kaaran ramayana, mahabharat, gita, pu raanon ke atirikt swami vivekananda,swami dayanand, bal gangadhar tilak tathaa mahatma gandhi ke sahitya kaa inhone gaharaa adhyayan kiya tha
 In the early days of his political life, Nathuram joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh
 ant main 1930 main rashtriya swayamsevak sangh bhi chhod diya or akhil bhartiya hindu mahasabha main chalaa gaya
 He also edited two newspapers named Pioneer and Hindu Rashtra
 ve mohammad ali jinna kii algaavvaadi vichaar-dhara kaa virodh karata tha
 Initially, he supported the programs of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, but later he became a strong opponent of Gandhi because of the consistent and repeated policy of discrimination against Hindus and the Muslim appeasement
 1940 main hyderabad ke tatkaaleen shaasha nizaam ne uske rajya main rahane vaale hinduon par balaat jajia kar lagane kaa nirnay liya jiskaa hindu mahasabha ne virodh karne kaa nirnay liya
 The first batch of Hindu Mahasabha activists went to Hyderabad under the leadership of Nathuram Godse on the orders of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, the then president of the Hindu Mahasabha
 hyderabad ke nizaam ne in sabhi ko bandi bana liya or karawas main kathor dand diye parantu baad main harkar usne apana nirnay waapas le liya
 The partition of India in 1947 and the communal violence at the time of partition gave Nathuram a great boost
 tatkaaleen paristhitiyon ko dekhte hue beesvin sadi kii us sabase bady traasadee ke liye mohandas karamchand gandhi hi sarvaadhik uttaradaayi samaj main aaye
 According to the decision taken at the time of partition, India was to give 75 crores rupees to Pakistan, out of which 20 crores had been given
 usee samay pakistan ne bharat ke kashmir praant par akraman kar diya jiske kaaran bharat ke tatkaaleen pradhanmantri pandit jawahar laal nehru or gruhamantri sardaar ballab bhai patel ke netritv main bharat sarkaar ne pakistan ko 55 karod rupee na dene kaa nirnay kiya, parantu bharat sarkaar ke is nirnay ke viruddh gandhi anshan par baith gayi
 Upset about this decision of Gandhi, Nathuram Godse and some of his colleagues decided to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi
 gandhi ke anshan se dukhi godse tathaa unke kuch mitron dwaara gandhi kii hatya yojananusaar nai dilli ke birla house pahunchakar 20 janvari 1948 ko madanlaal paahwa ne gandhi kii prarthana-sabha main bam feka
 According to the plan, Gandhi was to be killed at the time of the chaos caused by the bombings, but at that time his pistol was jammed and he could not move at all
 is kaaran nathuram godse or unke baaki saathi vahaan se bhagkar pune waapas chale gayi jabaki madanlaal paahwa ko bheed ne pakad kar police ke hawaale kar diya
 Nathuram Godse returned from Pune to Delhi to kill Gandhi and there were Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan who were visiting refugee camps
 usee dauraan unako ek sharnaarthi mila, jisase unhone ek italvi company kii bairata pistaul kharidi
 Nathuram Godse also confessed to the crime of possessing illegal scriptures
 usee sharnaarthi shivi main unhone apana ek chaaya-chitra khinchvaaya or us chitra ko do patron ke saath apane sahyogi narayan apte ko pune bhej diya
 On 30 January 1948, Nathuram Godse reached Birla Bhavan in Delhi 40 minutes before the time of prayer meeting
 jaise hi gandhi prarthana-sabha ke liye parisar main daakhil hue, nathuram ne pehle unhen haath jodakar pranaam kiya uske baad bina koi bilamb kiye apni pistaul se teen goliyaan maar kar gandhi kaa ant kar diya
 Godse made no attempt to escape after that
 nathuram godse par mohandas karamchand gandhi kii hatya ke liye abhiyog punjab ucch nyaayalay main chalaaya gaya tha
 Apart from this, 17 other prosecutions were also tried against him
 kintu itihaaskaaron ke matanusaar satta main baithe log bhi gandhi ji kii hatya ke liye utane hi jimmevaar the jitne ki nathuram godse yaa unke anya saathi
 If considered from this point of view, then Madanlal Pahwa should have been rewarded for this and not punished because he had bombed the same place ten days before the murder case and alerted the government that Gandhi, who was very revered All people used to say Bapu, no longer safe Anyone can go to a prayer meeting and shoot them
 muqadame ke liye nathuram ko sarvapratham punjab ucch nyaayalay main pesh kiya gaya
 He was awarded the death penalty on 8 November 1949 after a trial lasting over a year
 haalaanki gandhiji ke putr, manilal gandhi or ramdaas gandhi dwaara vinimay kii daleelein pesh kii gai thim, parantu un daleelon ko tatkaaleen pradhanmantri jawaharlal nehru, maharajyapal chakravarti rajagopalaachari evam uppradhanmantri vallabhbhai patel, teenon dwaara thukraa diya gaya tha

 duryodhana kii praaia: sari sena yuddh main maari gayi thi
 Ultimately he had a war with Bhimsen
 usne pandav-paksh ke paidal aadi bahut-se sainikon kaa vadh karke bhimsen par dhaava kiya
 At that time, Duryodhana's other younger brother, while hitting with mace, also saw Ashwatthama impatient after seeing the same condition of his king Duryodhana who was killed by Bhimsen's hand and remembering the death of his father Dronacharya
 chup kar vah pandavon ke shivi main pahunchaa or ghor kaalaratri main kripacharya tathaa kritavarma kii sahaayta se pandavon ke bache huye vir mahaarathiyon ko maar daalaa
 Not only this, he also beheaded the heads of the five sons of the Pandavas
 ashwatthama ke is kukarm kii sabhi ne ninda kii yahan tak ki duryodhana tak ko bhi yah acha nahin laga
 Unhappy with the killing of sons, Draupadi started mourning
 uske vilaap ko sun kar arjuna ne us neech karm hatyare brahman ke sir ko kaat daalane kii pratigya kii
 Hearing Arjuna's promise, Ashwatthama escaped
 shrikrishna ko sarathi banaakar evam apana gandiv dhanush lekar arjuna ne uskaa peechha kiya
 If Ashwatthama could not get protection anywhere, due to fear, he used Brahmastra on Arjuna
 ashwatthama brahmastra ko chalaanaa to jaanata tha par use lautaanaa nahin jaanata tha
 Seeing that very fiery fiery fire coming towards him, Arjuna pleaded with Shri Krishna, “O Janardhana! You are the God who created this three-dimensional vision
 shrrishti ke aadi or ant main aap hi shesh rahete hai
 You are the ones who incarnate to protect your devotees
 aap hi brahmaswaroop ho rachana karte hai, aap hi vishnu swaroop ho paalan karte hai or aap hi rudraswaroop ho sanhaar karte hai
 You tell me, where is this fierce fire coming from me and how will it protect me? " shrikrishna bole, “he arjuna! tumhaare bhay se vyakul hokar ashwatthama ne yah brahmastra tum par choda he
 Your life is in grave trouble with this Brahmastra
 vah ashwatthama iskaa prayog to jaanata he kintu iske nivaaran se anbhigya he
 To avoid this, you also have to use your Brahmastra, because it cannot be prevented by any other weapon
 ” Hearing this mantra of Shri Krishna, Maharathi Arjuna also left his Brahmastra immediately after being overwhelmed
 donon brahmastra paraspar bhid gayi or prachand agni utpann hokar teenon lokon ko tapt karne lagi
 All the subjects started getting burnt by their flames
 is vinaash ko dekhakar arjuna ne donon brahmastron ko lautaa kar shant kar diya or jhapat kar ashwatthama ko pakad kar band liya
 Shri Krishna said, "O Arjuna! Dharmatma, sleeping, inattentive, drunk, mad, ignorant, chariot, killing a woman and child is forbidden according to religion
 isane dharm ke viruddh aacharan kiya he, soye huye nirparaadh baalkon kii hatya kii he
 If alive, he will sin again
 atah tatkaal iskaa vadh karke or iskaa kataa hua sir draupadi ke saamne rakh kar apni pratigya puri karo
 " shrikrishna ke in shabdon ko sunne ke baad bhi dhiravaan arjuna ko guruputr par dayaa hi ai or unhone ashwatthama ko jivit hi shivi main le jaakar draupadi ke saamne upasthit kiya
 Mamtamayi Draupadi's tender heart melted after seeing the Guruputra tied like an animal
 usne guruputr ko namaskara kiya or use bandhanmukt karne ke liye arjuna se kaha, “he aryaputra! ye guruputr tathaa brahman hai
 a Brahmin is always worshipable and killing him is a sin
 aapane inke pita hi in apurv shastrastron kaa gyaan praapt kiya he
 Acharya Drona is standing in front of you as a son
 inkaa vadh karne se inaki mata kripi meri tarah hi kaatar hokar putr shok main vilaap karegi
 She did not sati with Dronacharya because of her special attachment to the son
 kripi kii aatma nirantar mujhe cosegi
 By killing them my dead son cannot come back! So, you free them
 ” Hearing Draupadi's words of justice and righteousness, everyone praised her, but Bhima's anger did not calm down
 is par shrikrishna ne kaha, “he arjuna! shastron ke anusaar patit brahman kaa vadh bhi paap he or aattaayi ko dand na dena bhi paap he
 So you do what is right
 ” unki baat ko samaj kar arjuna ne apni talwaar se ashwatthama ke sir ke kesh kaat daale or uske mastak kii mani nikaal lee
 When Mani came out, he became Mr
less
 shrihin to vah usee kshan ho gaya tha jab usne baalkon kii hatya kii thi kintu kesh mund jane or mani nikal jane se vah or bhi shrihin ho gaya or uskaa sir jhuk gaya
 Arjuna expels him from the camp in the same humiliated state
 ashwatthama ko apamaanit kar shivi se nikaal dene ke pashchaat saare pandav apane swajanon ko jaldaan karne ke nimitt dhritarashtra tathaa shrikrishnachandra ko aage kar ke apane vansh kii sampoorn striyon ke saath ganga tat par gayi
 Women went on mourning like Kurri, distraught over their grief, Dharmaraja Yudhishthira became very sad
 Dhritarashtra, Gandhari, Kunti and Draupadi all started mourning for their sons, grandchildren and relatives
 In order to mitigate their grief, Shri Krishna along with the monks, Dhaumya and Ved Vyas, gave them solace by illustrating them with many tips and explained that this world is perishable
 jo janma he uski mrityu nishchit he, sabhi kaal ke aadhin hai, mrityu sab ko khaati he
 Therefore, it is futile to mourn for the dead, after burnt ones Ajatashatru Dharmaraja Yudhishthira was made the king of Hastinapur and he performed three Ashwamedha Yajna, thus Yudhishthira's good fortune spread to all the three worlds
 Thought to leave and sat in the chariot by taking leave of the Pandavas and taking orders from the monks like Ved Vyas and Satyaki and Are presented for the Dwarka with Dhv
 At the same time, a rare incident occurred
 unhone dekha ki unki vadhoo uttara ne vyakul swar main kaha ki mujhe bachaao! majhe bachaao!! meri raksha karo! aap yoga-yogeshwar hai
 Gods are also deities
 sansar kii raksha karne vaale hai
 You are all powerful
 yah dekhiye prajjwalit lohe kaa baan mere garbh ko nasht na kar de
 Hey God You are the only one capable of protecting me
 aise kaatar vachan sun kar shrikrishna turant rath se kud pade or bole ki ashwatthama ne pandav vansh ko nasht karne ke liye phir se brahmastra kaa prayog kiya he, jisase uttara kaa garbh atynt jalane laga, parantu shrikrishna ne apane tap se shishu ko punarjivit kar diya
 When Dharmaraja returned to Yudhishthira and heard the news of son's birth, he was very happy and he donated to numerous Brahmins like cow, village, elephant, horse, grain etc
 uttam jyotishiyon ko bula kar balak ke bhavishya ke vishay main prashn puche

 Dharmaraja Yudhishthira was pleased to hear the horoscope told by the astrologers and gave them due Dakshina
 vah balak shuklapaksh ke chandramaa ke samaan din pratidin badhane laga
 At the same time, Dharmaraja Yudhishthira performed Ashwamedh Yagya by bringing the buried wealth of King Marut

 tab mata kunti ne apane putron se nivedan kiya kii ve karn ke liye bhi saare mritak sanskaron ko karen
 When he protested against this by saying that Karna was a Sood son, Kunti revealed the secret of Karna's birth
 tab sabhi pandav bhaiyon ko bhratrihatya ke paap ke kaaran jhatka lagata he
 Yudhishthira is particularly angry with his mother and curses her and all women, that women will not be able to hide any distinction since that time
 yudhisthir or duryodhana, donon karn kaa antim sanskaar karnaa chaahate the
 Yudhishthira claimed that since he is the junior brother of Karna, this is his right
 duryodhana kaa daawa yah tha kii yudhisthir or anya pandavon ne karn ke saath kabhi bhi bhratruvat vyavhaar nahin kiya isliye ab is samay is adhikaar ko jataane kly koi auchity nahin he
 Sri Krishna then intervenes and convinces Yudhishthira that Duryodhana's friendship is stronger, so let Duryodhana perform the last rites of Kern
 jab 18-din kaa yuddh samaapt ho jaataa he, to shrikrishna, arjuna ko uske rath se neeche utar jane ke liye kehete hai
 When Arjuna descends, they take him some distance
 tab ve hanumanji ko rath ke dhvaj se utar aane kaa sanket karte hai
 As Shri Hanuman gets down from that chariot, the horse of Arjuna's chariot burns alive and the chariot explodes
 yah dekhakar arjuna dahal uthta he
 Sri Krishna then tells him that Arjuna's chariot has exploded due to the fire arms of Pitamaha Bhishma, Guru Drona, Karna and Ashwatthama
 yah ab tak isliye surakshit tha kyonki us par swayan unki krupa thi or shri hanuman kii shakti thi jo rath ab tak in vinaashkari astron ke prabhaav ko sahan kiye hue tha
 After this, Yudhishthira went to Santhanunandan Bhishma, who was sitting on the Sharyasya in Kurukshetra and heard from him all the peaceful religion, Rajdharma, Moksha Dharma and Danadharma
 phir ve rajsinghaasana par asin hue

 kavyashastra kavy or sahitya kaa darshan tathaa vigyaan he
 It is a knowledge of theories emerging from time to time based on the analysis of poems
 uganuroop paristhitiyon ke anusaar kavy or sahitya kaa kathy or shilp badalata rahata he; falat: kavyashastreey siddhanton main bhi nirantar parivartan hota rahaa he
 This is illustrated by the historical practice of theories ranging from the principles of Bharata in India to today, and from Socrates and his disciples Plato in the West to the latest "navalochana"
 bharat main kavy naatakadi kritiyon ko 'lakshya granth' tathaa saidhantik granthon ko 'lakshan granth' kaha jaataa he
 These characteristic texts are always retrospective and following the target texts and great poets are seen challenging their rut
 kavyashastra ke liye puraane naam 'sahityashastra' tathaa 'alankarishastra' hai or sahitya ke vyapak rachanaatmak vaaiumay ko sametane par ise 'samikshashastra' bhi kaha jane laga
 Originally poetic thinking is seen to stabilize the theory in relation to the lexicon and the voyeur
 arestu ke "poytics" main kamedi, tragedy, tathaa apik kii samikshatmak kasuti kaa akalan he or bharat kaa naatyashaastra keval roopak yaa drishykavy kii hi samiksha ke siddhant prastut karata he
 This thinking in India and the west BC It is only in the third fourth century that it begins to meet in an adult form, which indicates that discussions about poetry had started many centuries ago
 kavyakruti mulat: tihare aayam se judi he – kavy, kavyakarta, kavyanushilak
 As far as theatrical poetry is concerned, the Natya user Natadi is also included in it along with the poet
 kavyashastreey chintakon kaa dhyaan in sabhi pakshon kii ore sadaa jaataa rahaa he
 The first question that arises in relation to the poet is, what is unique about the poet or artist from other human, preacher, philosopher, scientist, political thinker and why only persons of a particular nature are able to become poets or artists? In other words, what is for poetic power
 sucraat or plato kavitvsakti ko daivi aavesh kii dein maanate hai, adhyayan or abhyaas kaa pratifal nahin
 Poetologists of India consider genius to be predominant in poetry, and do not give any less importance to etymology and practice
 paramparawaadi aalochak keval pratibha ko kavyashakti kaa hetu nahin maanate
 On the other hand, the Romantic thinkers of the West consider the original inspiration of artwork as the only talent
 phir bhi is baat main sabhi chintak ekamat hai ki kavi vishisht pratibhashil vyakti he jo apni pratibha ke madhyam se kavy ke rup main nai sristi kii udbhaavna karata he
 The second important question is, what is the purpose of the poem? Why does a poet of poetry do poetry? There are two groups of thinkers in this regard - the traditionalist thinkers consider the goal or purpose of poetry to be the prestige of moral preaching
 kavy dwaara kavi kinhi mulyon kii sthapana karnaa chahta he, thik usee tarah jaise dharmik upadeshak
 But the difference is that his work becomes distinctive from the scriptures or ethics due to its stylistic delight and delight
 svachhndathawadi chintak ise nahin sweekaarta
 He does not consider the poet a preacher
 uske anusaar kavi sarjak he, srishtikarta he, jo brahma se bhi vishisht he
 He sets before us through his creation, his artwork
 vastut: vah apni anubhutiyon ko kavy ke dwaara vaani dena chahta he
 Poetry is nothing else, the essence of all its sensations and the flow of the swirling emotions in its inner being
 purv or pashchim ke praaia: sabhi matamtantar in do khevon main maje se samete ja sakate hai
 The most important aspect of poetry is the work which, before us, becomes the medium of visual, auditory and intellectual contrivance and through this it affects our mind or nature
 at: kavyashastreey chintan main yah vah pradhan paksh he jiske anek pahaluon ko lekar purv or pashchim ke vichaarak pichley adhaai hajaar varsho se uhapoh karte aa rahe hai
 The first question that arises about the poetry of poetry is how far the events described in the poem match the scientific truth
 yah praaia: sabhi sameekshak sweekaar karte hai ki kavy main tathy-kathan-pranali kaa aashray nahin liya jaataa
 The truth in which it is inaugurated is a probable truth rather than a real truth
 isi aadhaar par kavyavirohi kavi kii kalpana ko bhramit yaa satya se bahut dur ghoshit karte hai
 Plato has proved it to be far from the truth
 bharat ke vichaarkon ne kavyakruti ko bhranti nahin mana hai, yadhyapi ek sthaan par bhatta lollat ne rasasutra kii vyakhya karte hue naatak ke abhinay main ram aadi kaa anukaran karte naton main ram aadi ke bhrantigyaan kaa sanket kiya he
 In the West, in the context of the development of psychology, poetic thinking has strengthened this illusory side
 kaha jaataa he, kala maatr bhranti he 
 Similar to this is another opinion
 kala kuch nahin mahaj sammohan he 
 Here, on the basis of the study of the science of dance, the hypnotic power of poetry is being emphasized and it has emerged that poetry or art has magical effects like the chants of the exorcists of the old primitive society
 yaheen yah sawaal uthta he ki aakhir yah bhranti, sammohan yaa jaadui asar, agar ham puraane vidwaanon ke shabd ko udhaar lenaa chahen to kavy kaa "chamatkaar', kin tatwon ke kaaran paidaa hota he? kavy mulat: bhashaa main nibaddh hota he
 Language is a composite form of word and meaning
 at: pehla sawaal yah uthegaa ki kavy keval shabdamay he yaa shabdarthmay
 Both these views are prevalent with us
 bhamah, kuntak, mammat jaise chintak shabd or arth ke sammilit tatv ko kavy maanate hai, keval shabd ko yaa keval arth ko nahin, kyonki kavy main donon ko ek duusare se alag nahin kiya ja saktaa
 According to this view, in order to make poetry wonderful or compelling, the poet will have to give equal emphasis on the elegance of both words and meanings
 doosraa mat kavy kii prabhavanviti main shabd par, arthath uske bauddhik paksh kii apeksha shravan paksh par, adhik jor detaa he
 This is the view of the famous Sanskrit poet Panditraj Jagannath
 yah mat un logon kaa jaan padataa he jo kavy kii lay, shabdachayan, chand or shravan bimbavatta par adhik jor dete hai
 The Romanticist critics of the West, especially the emblematic poets and critics of France, clearly state that poeticism is not made of meaning or thought but by words
 agar is mat kii tulana ham ojhaaon ke nirarthak shabarjaal mantron se karen to pataa chalegaa ki yahan bhi arth kaa koi mahatv nahin, apitu shabdon kii lay, jhaad phunk karanevaale ojha ke mantrocchar kaa lahaza hi rogi ko prabhavit kar manashchikitsa karata kaha jaataa he
 This method is also for psychoanalytic treatment
 kavy ke prabhaav ko paidaa karne main shabd or arth kaa vishesh mahatv mana gaya he, isliye kavyashastreey chintan main shabd or arth ke paraspar sambandh par vichaar karnaa laazmi ho jaataa he
 The word has its intended relation to its traditional meaning
 is sambandh ko hamaare yahan abhidha vyapaar kaha gaya hai
 But in addition to this trade in the language, other trade is also seen to be working, where the word can give up its intended meaning and also believe in any other meaning related to it, which is known as symptom trade
 arestu ne bhi bhashaa ke in donon vyapaaron kaa vivechan apane prasiddh granth "retorics' main kiya he
 In poetic language, in reality the words are symbolic rather than censorious
 is baat par idhar pashchim main adhikadhik jor diya jane laga he or isaki shuruuaat svachhndathawadi kavi or vichaarak cholorij ne kii thi
 According to him, all poetic language is symbolic
 yah mat ai
e
richards, ampson aadi anya aadhunik kawychintakon ne bhi sweekaar kiya he
 According to this opinion, the images, metaphors, symbols and myths in poetry are all the literary processes of the language and not only that, the purpose of poetry verses, rhythm and vocabulary is also purely symbolic
 is mat se miltaa julata mat hamaare yahan dhvanivaadee kavyashastri kaa he jo kavyarthpratiti main lakshana se bhi ek kadam aage badhkar vyanjana kii pariklpana karte hai or kavy ke samast avyavon ko anubhuti yaa rasaroop vyangy kaa vyanjak maanate hai
 On the other hand, the curvilinear Kuntaka also considers the trade of the word and meaning in poetry not as simple designation, as vichitramidha or curvature and specifies the appropriation of this curvature in the verse like verse, verse, sentence, semantics, management
 kuntak ke is vibhaajan kii mul niv vastut: vaaman ke ritivaadee siddhant par tiki he
 By analyzing the composition or structure of poetry, it combines the compelling elements of the organs that affect the listener or reader
 yah vishleshan ek ore vyakaran or bhashashastra se or duusari or kalashastreey chintan se judaa hua he
 Here, the new poetic review of structuralist method which has taken place in America, took the same approach, which has been initiated by Vamana, Anandvardhan and Kuntak in our own way in relation to the discussion of Sanskrit poetry
 niabandh kii seemaa dekhte hue yahan kavy ke vibhinn angon par samay-samay par hue sabhi vichaaron kaa vivechan karnaa sambhav nahin he
 Poetry has basically two sides
 ek he kathyapaksh, jise ham vishaywastu ke vishesh prakaar ke abhidhaan main or usase abhivyakt kalatmak anubhuti yaa rasadi kii aantarik samvednaa main pate hai
 The second is the stylistic aspect of poetry in which the plan of rhythm, verses, vocabulary, qualities and ornamentation is discussed
 in tatwon par purv or pashchim ke vichaarkon ne vistaar se chintan kiya he
 But it has to be understood here that the effect of poetry is overall
 ye sabhi avyav apane apane dhang se us samgr prabhavanviti main yogadan karte dekhe jate hai
 The rhetorical and orthodox critics here do not accept this overall dominant opinion
 ve kavy kaa saundarya yaa chamatkaar shabd arth ke alankaar main yaa vishisht padrachana main maanate hai
 But from the point of view of curvilinear and soundist influences, they carry the totality of poetry, even if they also analyze the metaphysics of it
 pashchim main paramparawaadi sameekshak isi tarah kavy kii samagrata ko prabhaav kii drushti se nahin aankate or kavy main alankaar, uktivaichitrya, durarudh kalpana ko mahatv dete dekhe jate hai
 There has also been a thinker in the second century of Christ who established the principle of this totality of poetry
 longinus ke udaatt sambandhi siddhant kaa mul bhav yahi he
 The Romantic poets and critics of the West also consider the miracle of poetry in its totality and some of the same conceptions of Hindi's chauvinist and post-chauvinist critics
 hamaare yahan alankaar, reeti, vakrokti, ras, dhwani, auchity, chamatkaar jaise vividh kavyasiddhant jo chal pade the, ve sab mulat: kavy kaa saundarya kis ansh main he, isi aadhaar par hai
 Their special discussion will be unnecessary here
 kavi or kavy ke baad teesraa tatv kavy kaa shrota yaa pathak or naatak kaa darshak he jise dhvanivaadee ke shabdon main sahruday kaha jaataa he
 Sahridaya means a person with the same heart, who becomes engaged in it at the time of poetry, becomes a heart like a poet
 uski yah samanhridayata kavy main varnit vishisht patraadi yaa naikadi se bhi hoti he
 To establish this symmetry, Bhatnayak envisioned a simplification trade that Abhinavagupta has accepted
 bharat ke in rasvaadiyon ke anusaar kavyanushilak ke maanas main raag dweshadi rup raj or tam gunon kaa tirbhaav ho jaataa he tathaa satya ke udrek se man ko vishranti kaa anubhav hota he
 Abhinavagupta considers this situation to be similar to the tomb of the yogis
 pashchim main kavy kii aatma ko ras jaise tatv ke rup main maananevaala koi siddhant udit nahin hua he kintu vahaan pichhali sadi main svachhndathawad ke udai ke kaaran yah siddhant viksit hua he ki kavy kaa shrota yaa pathak kavi yaa kavivarnit paatr ke saath samanubhuti yaa sahanubhuti kaa anubhav karata he, jaisi hamen shakespeare ke hamelet yaa makebeth ke saath tathaa style ke promithus ke saath hoti he
 In our own way, psychological analysis of how we reach the logistics is found with Abhinavgupta
 par vah dhaanchaa maatr he
 More recent psychological studies have thrown more light on this aspect
 manovigyaan kii ek vishesh shakha, jisamen sharirkriya ke aadhaar par hamaare snayucentre ke samuttejan kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he or shravan, chakshush, sparshan, ghranaj tathaa rasanaj bimbon kaa athwa unki kalpana maatr kaa hamaare mastishk par kaise prabhaav padataa he or usase hamaara maanas kaise andolit hota he, isapar khojein hui hai or hoti ja rahi hai jo kavy or kalakriti kaa kavyanushilak par kaisaa, kyon or kaise prabhaav padataa he, iske vivechan main vyast hai
 It will be clear from the above discussion how wide the field of poetic thinking has become today
 vah ek ore vyakaran, bhashashastra, kalashaastra, darshan or chhandashastra ke chhoron ko choota he, to duusari ore manovigyaan or sharirkriya vigyaan se bhi ja judaa he
 Not only this, when we also start to pay attention to the historical, social motivations of poetry, then the scope of poetry increases further and it also connects with sociology, history and political thought
 yahi kaaran he ki aaj ke kavyashastreey chintan main kai drushtibhangimaayen milengi
 There are some that are steeped in traditionalist Eastern or Western molds, some are associated with the Romantic, Artistic, Dadaist, Futurist or Existentialist theories of the West and some are associated with either Freud's psychoanalytic or Marx's social realist philosophy
 sanskrit ke sahityashastriyon ne 'kavy ke lakshan' bataae he, jinamein se kuch is prakaar hai: Overseas Hindi writer in America

 vyaktigat naam, vyaktiyon kaa pratinidhitiv karne vaale pratik hote hai
 Karl Jung, a Swiss psychoanalyst who studied archetypes, proposed an alternative definition of the symbol and described it as distinct from the word sign
 In Jung's view, the sign is used for known objects such that a word is used to refer to it
 unhone ise pratik kii tulana main alag bataaya he; unke anusaar pratik kaa istemaal agyaat vastuon ke liye kiya jaataa he tathaa unhen spasht yaa sateek bananaa mushkil hota he
 An example of a symbol in this sense is Jesus Christ, the symbol of the primordial self

 kenneth bark homo sepiens kaa varnan, "pratik kaa upyog karne, pratik banane or pratikon kaa durupyog karne vaale jaanwaron ke rup main" karte hai, yah ingit karne ke liye ki ek vyakti apane jivan main pratikon ko banaata he saath hi unka durupyog bhi karata he
 To illustrate the misuse of the symbol, he cites the story of a person who, when told that the food given to him is actually fat of the whale, could not stop himself from throwing it
 baad main uske dost ko pataa chalaa ki vah to vastav main khaane kii ek saamaanya vastu thi
 But the man's reaction was a direct result of the fact that the "blubber" in his mind is a symbol of inedible material
 iske alaava, aadmi ke liye "blbar" ke pratik kaa nirmaan uske dwaara sikhi gayi vibhinn chizon kaa parinaam tha

 The word symbol comes from medieval English, Old French, Latin, and Greek in the English language σύμβολον; The Greek word σύμβολον comes from the root words συν - meaning "together" and βολή meaning "throwing", which roughly means "throwing together", literally meaning "coincidence" as well as its meaning "sign, stamp
" , Or "contract"
 is shabd ko sabase pehle harmees ke liye homer ke geet main istemaal kiya gaya he jab kachua dekhne par harmees ne use ek veena main badalane se pehle kaha σύμβολον ἤδη μοι μέγ ̓ ὀνήσιμον "simbolon of joy tu me, arthath, mere liye khushi kaa pratik he!" The meaning of the symbol can be modified by various factors including popular usage, history, and contextual intent
 kisi pratik vishesh ke spasht arth ko nirdhaarit karne vaale karkon main uskaa itihaas bhi ek kaarak hota he
 Older symbols may be redefined due to changes in the environment

 The canal is a man-made structure of water transport and transfer
 nahar shabd se aise jalmaarg kaa bodh hota he, jo prakritik na hokar, manavnirmit hota he
 It is mainly used in transporting water from one place to another place for farming
 naharen nadiyo ke jal ko sinchai hetu vibhinn kshetro tak pahunchaati hai
 Such waterways have been built since ancient times
 sinchai naharon ko banane ke atirikt unako acchhee dasha main rakhana kaaphi mahatvapurn kaary he
 Therefore, canal departments like India have special place in the administration of agricultural countries
 sinchai naharon main desh kii vah amuly nidhi bahati he jiske upar krishi utpaadan badi maatra main nirbhar karata he
 There are special laws governing the operation of canals, under which canal departments run their work
 kisi bhi desh main naharon dwaara yatayaat yaa krishikshetra ke vikaas main badi sahaayta milti he
 Sometimes, the entire economic chain of large areas is based on the canals
 laabhadaayak jalmaarg ke atirikt naharon kii upadeyata, kreedakshetra main tathaa udyog dhandhon kii vruddhi aadi ke kshetron main bhi bahut he
 For this reason, canals have a special place in the big creations of the world
 iskaa srijan mukhyat: do uddeshyon se hota he
 The first is for the joining of two or more waterways or harbors, through which water can flow through the waterways - be it by small boats or by big ships
 doosraa uddeshy, nadi yaa sarovaron se jal ko bhusinchan, jalapradaay tathaa anya aavashyaktaaon kii purti ke liye naharon dwaara dur dur tak pahunchaana
 The canals built for the first purpose are found in all parts of the world
 aisi hi ek nahar mughalon kii banaai hui dilli main thi jiske kinare bharat ke tatkaaleen pradhan mantri shri jawaharlal neh degree ke purvaj rahete the, isi kaaran unke parivaar kaa naam neh degree padaa
 Such canals are also big
 sansar kii prasiddh suez nahar, laal sagar or bumadhyasaagar ko milti he or panama nahar prashanth tathaa atlentic do mahasaagaron ke bich yatayaat kii suvidha pradaan karti he
 Both canals are the product of the modern era and are counted among the great works of engineering
 naharon or anya jalmargon main vishesh antar yah hota he ki anya jalmaarg, jaise nadi, naale or sagar prakritik hone ke kaaran swayan hi us dasha main bane rahete hai, kintu naharon ko thik dasha main rakhane ke liye sadaa upachaar karne padate hai
 For example, to keep the Suez Canal traffic-able, to extract sand from it, large machines are constantly employed and a large number of engineers have to be taken care of
 iske atirikt naharon main yatayaat ke liye bahudhaa "lock" banaae jate hai
 These "locks" make it possible to travel between high surfaces
 sagaron ke madhya hi nahin, bahut si nadiyon or jhiilon ko bhi naharon dwaara yatayaat ke liye jod diya jaataa he
 Such locks are located between Dal Lake and Jhelum River in Kashmir
 sansar ke kai shahar aise hai jahaan naharon dwaara hi shahar ke andar yatayaat ho saktaa he, jaise italy kaa vishwavikhyath venice nagar
 Many canals in Holland are built for traffic in cities like Amsterdam
 bharat main bhi shaharon ke madhya yatayaat ke liye badi naharen banaai gai hai jaise dakshin bharat main buckingham canal
 There are many small traffic canals in various parts of the country
 naharon kaa doosraa uddeshy he nadi yaa sarovaron se jalapradaay yaa bhusinchan ke nimitt jal ko dur-dur tak pahunchaana
 a lot of work in this direction has been done in India in the 19th century
 vaise, pracheen kaal kii bani hui bahut si naharen desh ke bhinn-bhinn bhaagon main dekhi jaati hai
 But special work has been done in Bhusinchan region itself, because India is an agricultural country
 bhusinchan ke liye bahut badi-badi naharen banaai gai thim
 Many centuries ago, canals were drawn in South India by creating an anicut on the Kaveri River
 aadhunik yug main ganga nadi se, punjab main sutluj or vyas nadi se badi-badi naharon kaa nirmaan hua jinke dwaara lakhon acre bhoomi ko sinchai kaa laabh hua
 In the Doab of Ganga Yamuna, about 32 lakh acres of land is irrigated every year by mixing the upper and lower Ganga Canal
 ise liye ganga yamuna ke doaab kshetron main lagbhag 8,000 mile choti badi naharon kaa jaal sa failaa hua he, jo vibhinn nadiyon or naalon ke bich ke kshetra ko sinchit karti hai
 It is the largest land-keeping system in India
 iske atirikt ganga nahar par sthit jalprapaaton se panbizli kaa utpaadan bhi hota he
 Therefore, the canals bring about multi-faceted development and along with the growth of agriculture in the irrigated area, they also progress in the industry and help in raising the standard of living of the people
 prashasan ko bhi acchhee naharon se rajasav kosh main aamadani ho jaati he, jaise upree or nichali ganga naharon se uttar pradesh prashasan ko san 1958-59 main lagbhag 1
6 karod rupye kaa, sab kharchaa aadi katkar, munafa rahaa
 Canals are man-made water flow systems that are of two types: 1
 Aqueduct : jo krishi yaa maanav upyog ke liye istemaal hoti hai
 Fresh water is also flowed as needed
 2
 Waterway canals : ye naharen yatayaat main kaam aati hai
 Ships and boats carry passengers or goods through the use of these canals
 ye naharen maujuuda jhiilon, nadiyon or samandaron ko joda karti hai
 Like the famous Suez and Panama canals
 The word canal is originally a Persian word
 netherlands ke shaharon main shahar kii naharen gracht bhi kehalaati hai
 The special thing in the construction of irrigation canals is that these canals are taken through such paths, where water may flow to both sides of the canals for irrigation
 at: nahar kaa bahaav sinchit kshetra ke antargat unchi se unchi bhoomi par hokar niojit kiya jaataa he
 The river and drainage, in contrast, flow from the bottom to the bottom of the area
 vastav main naharen bahudhaa do nadiyon yaa naalon ke madhya ucch bhoomi par hokar hi nikalati he
 Somewhere the canals have to cross many rivers and streams to reach this high ground
 udhaaharan ke liye, upree ganga nahar ko apane udgam sthaan haridwar or rudki ke bich lagbhag 20 mile ke faasale main chaar pahari nadiyon ko paar karnaa padataa he or vah bhi bhinn-bhinn rup se
 In fact the paved road runs along the Upper Ganges Canal from Roorkee to Haridwar and these 20 miles provide an opportunity to see some important engineering works
 do sthanon par nahar pahari nadiyon ko neeche se paar karti he ek jagah nadi nahar main mila lee jaati he or ek anya jagah, solani aquidct par, nahar nadi ke upar hokar guzarati he
 Solani Aqueduct is world famous
 yah mahatvapurn kaary, sirf eenton or chooney se, lagbhag 1850 i
 main puraa hua tha
 As the irrigation canal progresses, it becomes smaller like branches of trees
 iske vipareet nadiyaan jaise-jaise aage badhati hai, badi hoti jaati hai or unki sahaayak nadiyaan tathaa naale unamem milte rahete hai
 Branches originate from distribution canals or roads and small canals, called minor or bumblebees, emerge from them
 in sab naharon se kulabe, moudhe yaa out let dwaara pani kheton ke liye nikaala jaataa he
 All this distribution is compatible with scientifically determined principles
 yadi aisa na kiya jaae to naharon main, jo saikadon mile tak pani pahunchaati hai, pani hi na pahunche
 For this, government departments are established in which skilled engineers are appointed to keep the canals in good condition and to run prescribed amount of water in them
 naharon main pani bhi aisi gati se chalaaya jaataa he ki usase nahar main na to kataav ho or na talachat hi jamaa ho
 Wherever required, the falls are made so that the slope of the bottom of the canal can be kept in the prescribed condition
 is disha main bahut gaveshna kaary bharat main hua he or hota rahata he
 Many other problems arise in the operation of canals, the responsibility of the engineers remains to be solved
 naharon main aavashyaktaa ke anusaar nikaas bhi banaae jate hai, jinke dwaara aavashyaktaa na rahane par yaa kisi tut-foot ke samay, atirikt pani sameepvarti nadi yaa naalon main nikaala ja sake
 It is often said that the canal is running full and there was heavy rainfall in that area, which led to zero demand for betel water
 aisi avasthaa main moghe yaa kulabe band kar dene padate hai
 But the entire water cannot be fed by a canal, so it becomes mandatory to drain the water into the river or drains
