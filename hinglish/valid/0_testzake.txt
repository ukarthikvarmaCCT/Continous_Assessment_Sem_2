 vaarthikkaar katyayan vararuchi or prakritprakashkar vararuchi do vyakti hai

 ashok ke shilaalekh main vararuchi kaa ullekh he
 Though the tribe of Prakrit Prakriti Varruchi was also a Katyayan, on the basis of this, the writer and Prakrit Prakriti cannot be considered the same person, because the nature of Prakrit Varruchi in Ashoka's article seems clearly new
 falat: ashok ke purvavarti katyayan vararuchi vaarthikkaar hai or ashok ke parvarti vararuchi prakritprakashkar
 The "chaturbhani" published from Madras does not characterize the term "amphitheater", as the narrator Varruchi has been famous for the name "tithitapriya", and the use of the tantrits in "amphiteric" is very small
 sambhavat: yah vararuchi koi anya vyakti he
 The Katyayana, which has been discussed by Huyentsang in his travelogue, the Palaiyavana, which took place almost 300 years after Buddha-nirvana, is also a different person from the narrator

 There were many obstacles in its construction, both the chief craftsmen died, so sometimes it took too much delay and money
 beesvin shatabdi tak bhi andar kii saaj sajja kaa kaam ruuk ruuk chalata rahaa
 Due to the air pollution of London, its conservation work has been going on ever since
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke dauraan jab 1941 main iske kaaman chembar main bambaari hui thi tab se yahaan par purnirmaan kaa kaam chal rahaa he
 This palace has been the center of London's political life
 westominster landan kii sansad ke liye methome ban chukaa he
 The Westminster system of government has been named after it
 vishesh rup se clock tower, jo apni mukhya ghante ke kaaran big ben ke rup main janaa jane laga he, landan kaa pratishthit aitihaasik sthal or shahar kaa mukhya paryaton centre he

 1970 se hi pales of westominster ucchkoti kii imaarat maani jaati he or 1987 se yah unesco ke vishwa dharohar sthalon kaa hissaa he
 The Palace of Westminster was also diplomatically important because of its position during the Middle Ages as it was built on the banks of the River Thames
 madhyakaal main throni island ke naam se mashhoor is jagah ko 1016 se 1035 main canut da great ne apana shahi mahal banaaya hua tha
 St
 Edward the Confessor built a royal palace on Throny Island before the end of King Saxon of England
 It was west of the city of London

 The part of the palace that lasted the longest period was from William 1 to the time of King William 2
 madhya kaal ke ant tak pales of westominster shaasha kaa mukhya grih tha
 The curia regis used to congregate in the Westminster Hall in the same place as the earlier draft of Parliament
 england kii pehali adhikarik sansad da model parliament kii baithak is mahal main 1295 main hui
 lagbhag iske baad kii sabhi sansad vahaan par sabha kar chuki he
 In 1530 King Henry VIII seized York Place from Cardinal Thomas Wolsey
 vah ek shaktishaalee mantri tha jisane apane raja kaa samarthan kho diya tha
 Henry named it the Palace of Whitehall and made it his main home
 yadhyapi westominster aadhikarik taur par shahi mahal hi rahaa
 It was used by both the Houses of Parliament and the Royal Courts
 kyonki vastav main yah ek shahi grih tha, isliye yahaan par donon sadanon ke kisi anya kaary ke liye koi kaksh nahin banaaya gaya tha
 The main festivals of the state were celebrated in painted rooms
 house of lords kii baithak vastav main rani ke kaksh main hoti thi
 This elegant hall was located at the south end of the building which was built in the medieval period
 1801 main ucch sadan bade safed kaksh main sthanantarit ho gaya
 It used to be in the Court of Request before
 jise 18 veen shatabdi main raja jorge tritiy ne banwaaya tha
 At the same time there was a treaty with Ireland
 yah kadam isliye uthaaya gaya kyon ki purv kaksh main bade hue mitra samooh ke liye jagah nahin thi
 The House of Commons had no chamber of its own, its meetings were sometimes held in the Chapter House of Westminster Abbey
 kamans ne pales main stephen chapel ke rup main apane liye ek sthai jagah bana lee
 Stephen's Chapel was the former chapel of the Royal Palace during the reign of Edward VI
 1547 main yah imaarat kamans ke istemaal ke liye uplabdh ho gayi
 St Stephen's College had to be disbanded for this
 agali teen shatabdiyon main stifan ke chapel main kai badlaav kiye gayi, taaki nichle sadan kii suvidha barkaraar rahe
 Then immediately, his form of medievalism was completely destroyed
 kyonki sansad ko apane simit jagah me kaary karne main pareshaani ho rahi thi isliye pales of westominster main 18 veen shatabdi ke baad se kai prakaar ke parivartan kiye gayi
 The talk of building an entirely new palace was ignored, instead new buildings were added to it
 a new western main gate was built between 1755 and 1770
 yah darwaja saint margaret street kii ore khulata tha
 It was built in the Padalian style
 ab saamudayik kaksh evam sangrakshan ke liye kaaphi jagah ho gayi thi
 In 1795 a new official residence was built for the Speaker of the House of Commons
 yah saint stephen chapel ke saath sata hua tha
 Between 1799 and 1801 the new Gothic craftsman James Wyatt started his work in both the Houses, the House of Lords and the House of Commons
 1824 or 1827 ke bich mahal kii puri imaarat ko ek baar phir se banaaya gaya
 And this time Sir John Son did it
 madhya kaaleen house of laders kaa chembar jo ki 1650 main gan powder plot ke fail hone par nishaanaa bana tha
 He was devastated to carry out this renovation work
 taaki is jagah ke dakshin sire par ek nayaa shahi galiyara or bhavy pravesh dwaar banaaya ja sake
 The tasks that Son did in the palace included the new facility of the library for both the houses of Parliament and the new law room for the king's law bench and the high court
 son dwaara kii nayi kalatmak shilpkaaree ko lekar kai virodhabhas bhi uthne shuru ho gayi
 Those who supported the Gothic art of the original building became opposed to it
 16 oktober 1834 ko pales main aag lag gai jab lathi bhandar main rakhe aag ke stove ke atyadhik tap jane ke kaaran house of laders ke kaksh ne aag pakad lee
 iske parinaam swaroop sansad ke dono sadan nasht ho gayi or aas paas kii anya imaaraten bhi nahin bachiin
 aag bachaav dal kii sartakta ke kaaran or hawa kii disha ke anukool hone kii vajah se westominster haul batch gaya
 The Jewel Tower, the Under Craft Chapel, the Cloisters and the Chapter House of St
 Stephen's are the other parts of the palace that survived the disaster
 aag lagane ke turant baad hi raja wiliam IV ne apana buckingham pales sansad ko dene kii peshkash kii, jo banakar lagbhag taiyaar ho chukaa tha
 The reason behind this was also that he did not like her as his place of residence
 is imaarat ko sansad ke kaary ke liye upyukt nahin paaya gaya
 Therefore the offer was rejected
 charing cars or james park par bhi vichaar nahin ban paaya
 Historical and political connections to Wesminster proved powerful for the transfer
 jabaki vahaan kai kamiyaan thim
 Now priority was being given that Parliament should get its place as soon as possible
 isliye house of lard tathaa house of kamans ke liye jaldi main chitrakala vaale kaksh or safed kaksh ko taiyaar kiya gaya
 The direction for this was done by the remaining craftsman of the Board of Works, Sir Robert Smirk
 farvari 1835 sadan chalaane ke liye kaksh taiyaar karne kaa kaam jaldi jaldi kiya gaya
 a royal organization appointed to study the new structure of the palace, its proposed style was also debated among the people
 ab yah nai uttam padyati jo ki sanyukt rajya ke fedral capital or white house jaisi thi, us samay kaaphi prachlit hui
 yah style pehle son dwaara puraane mahal ke kuch hisse main bhi istemaal kii ja chuki thi
 It had signs of revolution and republic in the new format
 jabaki gothic sanrachana main sangrakshan ke mulya ke mulya chhipe the
 In 1835, this commission had announced that the format of this building would be either Gothic or Elizabethan
 This royal commission asked all architects to plan with this view
 1836 main 97 paraspar virdohi yojanayen padhane ke baad shahi ayog ne gothic style kaa mahal banane ke liye bairi kii yojana ko chunaa
 isaki neenv to 1840 main hi daal di gai thi
 Lord's Room was completed in 1847 and Commons' Room in 1852
 Although 1860 employees were engaged for this work, this work could not be completed for a decade
 bairi jisaki apni shilpakala gothic kam or panrparik zyada he
 He built this new palace on the basis of new rules of balance
 He relied on Augustus Pugin for interior decoration and grand construction
 Which included wall decoration, carving work, tile work, furniture etc
 duusare vishwa yuddh ke dauraan jab germany ne landan par bambaari kii thi tab alag alag avasar par chaudaa baar pales of westominster bhi is bambaari kaa shikaar hua tha
 On 26 September 1940, a bomb was dropped in the old palace
 is bambaari main saint stifan porch kii dakshini diwaar nasht ho gayi thi or saath hi iskaa pashchimi mukhadwar bhi nasht ho gaya tha
 The statue of The Loin Richard had also risen somewhat from its place due to this powerful explosion and the sword raised above it fell
 is pratimaa ko loktantr ke pratik ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 It is said that "in the event of an attack, even if you bow down a little, it will not break"
 a second bomb that fell on 8 December destroyed many monasteries
 10 / 11 may 1941 ko sabase zyada khatarnaak hamalaa hua tha, tab pales ko kam se kam 12 jatke lage the or teen logon kii mrityu ho gai thi
 a fiery bomb hit the chamber of the House of Commons and set fire to it
 The second bomb rocked the roof of Westminster Hall
 The fire rescue team could not save both and it was decided that at least work should be done to keep Andal Hall safe
 These people were successful in this task
 lekin comons kaksh puri tarah se nasht ho chukaa tha or sadsy lobby bhi nahin bachi thi
 a bomb also fell into the lord's chamber, but went off without a break on the ground
 yaa to koi chota bam upar clock tower se takaraayaa tha yaa phir koi vimaan bhedi chat ke chajje par gira tha
 Due to which the roof was severely damaged
 ghadi kaa sheesha puri tarah se nasht ho chukaa tha
 But its hands and bell were still working and even now this big watch was telling the right time
 kamans chembar ke nasht hone ke baad, lard ne swayan kaa vaad vivaad kaksh kamans ke istemaal ke liye de diya 
 or lard ke swayan ke istemaal ke liye quins robing room ko kuch samay apane prayog main laane ke liye lard ne rakh liya
 After the war the Commons Room was remodeled under the direction of the craftsman Sir Giles Gilbert Scott
 is baar yah bahut hi saadhaaran puraane kaksh kii style main banaaya gaya
 This work ended in 1950
 ab donon sadanon ko apana apana kaksh mil gaya
 Now the need for office space began to increase and the Parliament acquired some space in the nearby Norman Shaw building in 1975

 With this increase, there is space for all mps to create their own offices

 But he was assisted by the Gothic craftsman Augustus Pugin
 gyarahavi shatabdi main bana westominster haul jo 1834 kii aagjanee ko jhel chukaa he
 This hall was designed by Barry
 pugin is kaam ke nattejey se khush nahin the
 He was mainly dissatisfied with the design plan devised by Barry
 unhonen iske liye ye tippanee bhi kii thi ki sabhi gracian, sar, yah paaramparik imaarat par tuder style kaa vivaran he"
 The stonework done on this building was actually Anston
 yah ek baaluu ke rang kaa magangian limestone he
 Whose mine is in Anston village in South Yorkshire
 yah pathar halaki pradooshan or duusare istemaal ho rahe kam gunvattta vaale pattharon ke kaaran jaldi hi kharaab hone laga
 yadhyapi yah sab kharabiyaan jald se jald 1849 tak thik kar lee gayi thim or iske baad 19 veen shatabdi main kuch nahin kiya gaya tha
 During 1900, one thing was very clear that some work of stone carving would have to be changed now
 
 The project was started in 1930, but due to the Second World War, its work stopped and it was finished in 1950 itself
 1960 tak pradooshan ab phir se prabhavi hone laga
 1981 main towers or bahari unnayan ke pattharon ke sangrakshan kii ek yojana shuru hui

 At the southern end of this palace is a very famous tower known as the Clock Tower, it is also known as Big Ben
 yah 96
3 meter ke victoria tower se thodaa hi chota he lekin bahut hi patala he
 It has a large clock in Westminster
 jise ki edward jon dent ne banaaya tha or iskaa dizin shaukia horologist edmund backet denisan ne taiyaar kiya tha
 In a moment, its bells ring completely, the specialty of this big watch is that its timing is absolutely accurate, which the 19th century watchmakers considered difficult
 or 1859 se jab se yah astitv main ai he is par bharosa kaayam he
 Its time is measured in diameter by four dials 7 meters, which are made of milky colored glass and at night it shines from behind
 iskaa ghante vaala haath 2
7 meter lanbaa he or minute vaala haath 4
3 meter chota he
 Five bells hang in the clock on the top of the house
 chaar chaturthaansh ghantiyaan westominster ke ghantanad ko har ghante ke har chauthe bhaag main bajaati rahati hai
 The biggest bell when the bell rings is called the Great Bell of Westminster in official language
 saamanyata ise bigaben bhi kehete hai
 Which is the name given to uncertain origins, this name started to be used for the tower over time
 The first bell, which was given this name, broke during testing and it was then re-molded
 There is a rift in the vine that is in front of us today
 jiske kaaran isaki dhwani bhi kuch alag ho gayi he
 If seen, its weight is 13
8 tonnes, the third largest clock in Britain
 The lantern that is placed at the top of the clock tower is the Ayrton light, it only burns when the assembly of the rough house of Parliament continues even after dark

 He was in charge of ventilation of the new Parliament House
 inaki yojana ke anusaari hi pales ke madhya main ek badi chimney banaai gai thi
 For which they had said that the polluted and hot air generated by the fire burning from all four sides of the palace will come out through this chimney
 In order to replace the tower, it was emphasized to Barry that he planned the high roof of the lobby
 un chhaton ko nicha hi rakhaa jaye
 or isaki khidakiyon kii oochai ko bhi kam kiya jaye
 halaki yah stambh bhi mahal kii bahari sanrachana ke liye ek acha mauka sabit hua
 Barry had conceived the design of a tower for this so that these large pillars could be balanced
 Eventually, the central tower completely failed in its purpose
 But this work was worth noting because it was the first time mechanical services were directly impacting the craft
 shikhar choote kangure jo khidakiyon ke baade ke bich tathaa mahal ke saamne se uthte hue upar kii ore ja rahe hai, yah aakash ke kshitij se lagati imaarat ko sajiv banaate hai
 Like the central tower, it is also connected for some practical reasons, it also makes way for the movement of light
