 The jury eventually found that the NTP patents were valid, that RIM infringed them, that the infringement was "willful" and that the infringement caused NTP a loss of $ 3
3 million
 Judge James R
 Spencer raised the damages to $ 53 million because the violation was intentional
 unhone RIM ko yah bhi nirdesh diya ki vah NTP ke 4
5 karod dollar ke kanoonee shulk kaa bhi bhugtan kare or ek nishedhagna jari kar RIM ko patent kaa ulanghan band kar dene or isse baj aane ko kaha

 During the appeal process in March 2005, RIM and NTP tried to resolve their dispute
 One of the terms of the agreement was $ 450 million in damages
 But talks broke down due to other issues

 In early November of 2005, the US Department of Justice filed an order requesting that the US federal government be allowed to continue the RIM service since there are a large number of blackberry users
 janvari 2006 main, america ke sarvocch nyaayalay main patent ke ulanghan ke liye deyta kii dhaarit raashi par RIM kii apil sunne se inkaar kar diya or yah maamla nichali adaalat main laut gaya
 The District Judge can apply the earlier stay order on the prohibition on the sale of RIM in the US and the use of blackberry devices in the US if both parties reach an agreement
 9 farvari 2006 ko america ke raksha vibhaag ne ek aadesh-patr daayar karte hue kaha ki sarkari upyogkartaaon ko chhodkar baaqi blueberi seva band karnaa asaadhya he

 In special circumstances, when the military takes over the judicial system of a country, then the rules that are in effect are called military law or martial law

 For example, martial law was implemented in Germany and Japan after World War II
 iske alaava praaia: takhta palat ke baad bhi marshall lau laga diya jaataa he
 Sometimes martial law is imposed even in the event of a great natural disaster
 ) There are special laws like curfew etc

 praaia: marshall lau ke antargat nyaay dene ke liye sena kaa ek tribunel niyukt kiya jaataa he jise court marshall kaha jaataa he

 faujee kanoon kaa arth ek ore to shasnadhikariyon kii yah sweekaarokti hoti he ki desh yaa kshetravishesh main aisi sthiti utpann ho gai he jab takat kaa saamana takat se karnaa aavashyak he, at: unke haath main aise asaamaanya adhikaar hone chahie jinka upyog sankat kaal kii avadhi tak desh ke aantarik anchal main kiya ja sake, is sthit main nyaayalayon kii prakriya ke sthaan par karypalika athwa sainik prashaasak ke adeshon ko hi sarvaadhik manyata praapt ho jaati he
 On the other hand, military law is the idea of a legal suffix, whereby the civil courts have tried to control the extraordinary rights which are acquired by the executive to apply to the citizens of the state
 is prakaar faujee kanoon, sainik kanoon se, jo sashastr saindal ke niyantran kaa vishesh kanoon hota he, bhinn he
 When the armed forces are used for the exercise of civil rights, then the army does its work under the control of civil authorities and the criminals are considered in ordinary courts
 kintu faujee kanoon main naagarik adhikariyon or nyaayalayon ke adhikaar sthagit kar die jate hai or aparaadhiyon par sainik ayog ke samaksh mukadmaa chalaaya jaataa he
 In England, the emperor does not have the right to declare a crisis, but at the time of war, the executive has the right to disseminate several arrangements and orders under parliamentary legislation and corresponding acts

 In American law, to what extent the President has the right to declare military law, independent of congressional action, and how much control can be exercised by the legislature and the courts in that situation, it is still a matter of dispute and the legal situation in this case is now Is also unclear
 bharat main bhi spasht sanvaidhanik nirdesh ke abhaav main yah vivaadaaspad he ki faujee kanoon kii ghoshnaa kaa adhikari koun he
 The reference to military law is only in the 34th section, which provides for the Compensation Act after the military law is lifted in a particular area
 kintu faujee kanoon se miltaa julata hi dhara 359 ke antargat raashtrapati kaa vah adhikaar hota he jisase vah dhara 21 or 22 ke antargat adhikaron kaa nyaayik nishpaadan sthagit kar de saktaa he
 It is understood that this is basically a form of military law, but it appears that the Supreme Court has left it for dispute, whatever may be adopted in this regard, under Section 352 of the Constitution of the crisis
 The effect of the Declaration on Fundamental Rights is at the same level as that of military law
 is prakaar dhara 358 ke antargat jab tak sankatkalin sthiti kaayam rahati he, karypalika ko dhara 19 kii vyavasthaaon ke ulanghan kaa adhikaar rahata he
 Other fundamental rights may also be suspended by the President for a period of crisis under Section 359 or for the period mentioned in the order
 raashtrapati ke adhikaar par keval itnaa hi niyantran hota he ki sankatkaal kii ghoshnaa sweekruti ke liye sansad ke samaksh prastut kii jaani chahie
 There is no fixed period for presenting this declaration before the Parliament and there is no provision for any penalty if it is not presented, but it ends automatically after two months of the declaration being aired
 ek ghoshnaa ke samaapt hone par phir duusari ghoshnaa jari karne main raashtrapati par koi pratibandh nahin he
 The President's order issued under section 359 should be presented to the Parliament at the earliest
 is prastutikaran ke samay kaa nirnay karnaa karypalika par chhod diya gaya he kyonki yadi raashtrapati kaa aadesh sansad ke samaksh prastut nahin kiya jaataa to bhi iskaa prabhaav kam nahin hota or na hi prastut karne ke abhaav main koi vaidhanik karrwai kii vyavastha he
 During the 1962 Chinese invasion, the President declared a crisis situation by postponing the execution of sections 14, 21 and 22 of the Constitution
 halaat bahut kuch saamaanya ho jane ke baad bhi ghoshnaa ko radd karne main atyadhik vilamb kiye jane par saarvajanik rup se badi aalochana hui thi
 This fact has necessitated the imposition of some further protection in relation to the rights of the crisis, because if it is not so, any unwary officer can abolish the constitution for his convenience and make the military law permanent

 hakhaamani vansh yaa ajamidh samrajya pracheen iran kaa ek shaasha vansh tha
 It was the first ruling dynasty in the known history of ancient Iran to have acquired sovereignty over almost the whole of present-day Iran and moreover, during its peak it ran from Greece in the west to the Indus River in the east and from the Caspian Sea in the north to the south
 Had spread to the Arabian Sea

 Its area was around modern Haryana
 isaki rajdhani sambhawatah hastinapur yaa indraprastha thi
 The extent of the expansion of the kingdom of Kuru must have been a matter of discovery for Indians, but in world history, Kuru was the Chakravarti king who gave new dimensions to the largest empire of the ancient world, while transferring the Med empire in Iran from his own maternal grandfather Astyagus
 The empire was renamed Ajmeedh Achaemenid_empire empire

 When Kuru became hereditary king of Anshan in 559 BCE, he refused to accept the Mead dominance and revolted against the Mead empire
 usne isapurv 549 main maid raja astyagas kii rajdhani hamaadaan par adhikaar kar liya
 He declared himself the King of Paras and made the Mead Empire his ally

 From the Greek cities to the Caspian Sea in the Middle East and along the coast of Turkey, hardly anyone in the world has stood up to that time

 An inscription found near Bisitun in western Iran states that a Magi named Gaumata revolted
 usne apane ko kambojia kaa chota bhai bataakar farsi janata par pade karon ke khilaaf logon ko bhadakaayaa tha
 It was true that during the time of Kurosh and Kambojia, the Iranian people had fought a lot of battles and the expenditure came from taxes imposed on the people
 par iske kuch hi dinon baat daara ne gaumata ko maar diya or shah ban baitha
 He later inscribed the events of those days in Bisitun

 But the kingdom of Dara had become very large by that time and Alexander's victory with a defeat cannot be assured

 Dara fled the battlefield and the Yavans took control of the Persian army

42361 Sparta or Lasdemon was a major city-state in ancient Greece, on the banks of the Eurotus River in Laconia, southeastern Peloponnes
 10veen sadi isa purv ke aasapaas yah ek raajnneetik ikai ke rup main us vaqt ubhar kar saamne aayaa, jab hamalavar doriens ne sthaneey gaiyr-dorian aabaadi ko apane kabje main kar liya
 It emerged as an influential ground military force in ancient Greece from c
 650 AD
 apni samarik shreshthata ke kaaran, unani-farsi yudhon ke dauraan sparta ko sanyukt unani sena-vahini ke samgr netaa ke rup main manyata mili
 isa-purv 431 or 404 ke bich, pelloponatial yuddh ke dauraan sparta athens kaa pradhan shatru rahaa, jisase yah mahaan vijeta banakar ubhara, haalanki, kaaphi kshati uthaani padi

 haalanki isapurv 146 tak isane apni rajnatik aazaadee barkaraar rakhi
 Sparta was unmatched in ancient Greece due to its social system and constitution, which focused entirely on military training and excellence
 iske nivaasiyon ko spartats, mothaces, perioikoi, evam heltos 
 spartats ko sakht uttejit prashikshan or shaikshanik shashan-pranali se hokar, guzarana padataa tha tathaa sparton sipaahiyon ke sanghatit vyuh yudhon main ajey samajhe jate the
 Spartan women in particular enjoyed more rights and equality than men, which was not available anywhere in the cultured world

 Spartaco is commonly referred to as Lacedaemon by the ancient Greeks as Atwalasdemonia Lacedaemonia, these names have been commonly used in the compositions of Homer and the Athenian historians Herodotus and Thussaides
 herrodotus ne keval pehle vaale kaa hi prayog kiya he or kuch parichchhedon main to aisa lagata he ki sparta shahar ke nichle hisse ke vipareet, theraapan ke macinian greek durg ko hi uddhrut karne ke liye hi kiya gaya he
 The eastern plateau of the Tagatos Mountains, in a region close enough to the city of Sparta, was commonly referred to as Laconia
 kisi samay is shabd kaa saadharantaya sparton ke sidhe niyantran vaale sabhi kshetron ke liye prayog kiya jaataa tha, jisamen messenia bhi shaamil tha
 In the context of Lacedaemon, the initial word Mycenaean was the Greek Ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo, literally translated as "lancey Daemonian", written as linear b in the alphabetical script
 unani mythkashastra main, lacidemon sundari apsara taygate se janma jiyas kaa betaa tha
 He married Sparta, making him the father of Amiclas, Euridias, and Asin
 He became the king of the country, which he named after himself and named the capital after his wife
 aisa maananaa he ki usne hi cherretiz ke abhayaarany kaa nirmaan kiya tha, jo sparta or emiclay ke madhya avasthit tha, tathaa cleta evam phenna naamak do devataaon ko pradaan kar diya gaya tha

 The valley of Evrotus is a natural fortress, surrounded by the western part of Mount Tegetus and the eastern part by Mount Pernon
 uttar main, laconia arkedia kii unchi pahari bhoomi se ghira hua he jisaki unchai 1000 meter tak bhi pahunch jaati he
 These natural security circles have provided Sparta with a comfortable position as well as contributed to Sparta never being looted
 jameen se ghire hone ke baavjood sparta ke paas laconia kii khadi main, gethio naamak ek bandargah bhi tha
 Reconstructing Sparta's prehistory is difficult, as literary evidence has long since disappeared from the narrative of events, and the oral tradition of folklore distorts the truth
 haalanki sparta anchal main logon ke basane ke kai aarambhik pramaanon main, mitti ke bartan milte hai jo madhya navpashan yug kii avadhi ke maane jate hai
 These vessels were found in Kofovuno, some two kilometers from Sparta
 ye praarambhik micenian sparton sabhyataa ke aarambhik avshesh he jiskaa ullekh homer ke elliod main kiya gaya he
 This civilization appears to have declined by the end of the copper age, according to Herodotus, the Macedonian tribes attacked the Peloponnes from the north, where they were called Dorians and permanently inhabited by local tribes
 aisa lagata he ki doriens ne apane rajya kii sthapana karne se praayah bahut purv hi sparton rajya-kshetra kii simaaon kaa vistaar karnaa aarambh kar diya tha
 They also fought against the Argive Dorians, who lived in the east and south-east, and also with the Arcadian Acians of the northwest
 This evidence suggests that Sparta is relatively inaccessible due to the geographic design of the Tegeton plains, which was safe from the earliest times: fortifications were never fortified
 aathvin or saatvin sadi isa purv ke madhya sparta ne naagarik sangharsh or araajaktaa kaa anubhav kiya jise herrodotus or thusaidids donon ne hi baad main chalakar pramanit kiya he
 As a result, he took up the task of political and social reforms of his own society, later he gave credit to the semi-legendary MLA Lykargas
 ye sudhaar shreshth saanskrithik sparta ke aarambhik itihaas ke sakshya hai
 In the Second Mensenian War, Sparta established itself as a local power in the Peloponnes and the rest of Greece
 aanevaali sadiyon ke dauraan, sparta kii sthal yuddh kii takat ke rup main pratishtha kii koi shaani nahin thi
 In 480 BCE, a small army of Spartans — the Corps, Thespians, and Thebans — and Thebans, led by King Leonidus, fought endlessly against the vast Persian army-corps in the Battle of Thermopylae, and finally all four The Persian troops suffered a large number of casualties before being besieged
 High-quality weapons, skillful tactics, and bronze armor of the Greek city state's civilian army and their organized corps corroborated their qualifications a year later when Sparta was fully mobilized and fought at the Battle of Plataea Led the Greek alliance against the Persians
 plataeya main nirnaayak unani jeet ne unani-farsi yuddh ko hameshaa ke liye ant kar diya or iske saath hi europe main farsiyon ke vistaar kii mahatvakanksha bhi samaapt ho gai
 Although this war was won by the all-greek Army, credit was given to Sparta, who was the de facto leader of the entire Greek campaign despite becoming leader in Thermopylae and Plataea
 parvarti pracheen saanskrithik kaal main, athens, thebes or faras ke saath-saath sparta apana varchasv banane ke liye ek-duusare ke khilaaf ladane main pramukh shaktiyaan raheen
 pelloponnessinyan yuddh ke parinamswaroop, sparta paramparaagat taur par mahadwipiya samskruti, vaala hokar bhi ek nesainik shakti ban gaya
 apni shakti ke shikhar par pahunchakar sparta ne kai pramukh unani rajyon ko apane adheen kar liya or yahaan tak ki abhijaat athenian nauvahini par bhi apana kabja jamaane main kaamyaab rahaa
 5veen sadi isa purv ke ant tak yah ek rajya ke rup main upar uthakar saamne aayaa jisane athenian samrajya ko parrast kiya or anatolia ke farsi praanton par akraman kiya
 This was a period in which the Spartan hegemony left its mark
 corinthian yuddh ke dauraan sparta ko mahatvapurn unani rajyon, thebes anthens, corinth evam argos ke pramukh gathbandhan kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 shuru-shuru main is gathbandhan ko faras kaa samarthan praapt hua, anatolia main jisaki bhoomi par sparta dwaara akraman kiya ja chukaa tha or jise asia main sparta ke or aage ke vistaar kaa bhay bhi tha
 Sparta continued to win back-to-back battles, but many of its ships were destroyed in the Battle of the Nides by the hired ships that Persia provided to Athens
 is ghatana ne sparta kii nausainik shakti ko kaaphi kshati pahunchaai lekin faras par aage bhi akraman karne kii isaki aakanksha ko tabatak samaapt na kar sakaa jabatak ki athenian senapradhan ne sparta kii samudri tatavarti seemaa ko tabah na kar diya tathaa buudhe sparton ke man main healout vidroh ke bhay ko uksaa diya
 387 BC After several years of fighting, the peace of Antalsadl was established, according to which all the Greek cities of Lonia would be restored to Persia and the Persian border of Persia would be free from the possibility of Spartan invasion
 Persia's ability to successfully intervene in Greek politics as a result of the war was a reaffirmation and was also to accept Sparta's dominant position in the Greek political system with certainty
 liyukatra ke yuddh main thebes ipaminondos ke haathon bhayanak sainya paraajay ke pashchaat sparta dderghaavadhi ke liye patan kii ore unmukh ho gaya
 yah pehali baar tha ki sparton sena sthal-yuddh main puri tarah parrast ho gai
 Since Spartan citizenship was inherited only by blood relations, Sparta now increasingly had to face the population of Helot, whose numbers outstripped those of citizens
 sparton nagarikon kii sankhya main ise khatarnaak giravat par arestu ne bhi tippanee kii he
 371 BC Sparta never recovered from the damage the Sapartons suffered in the Battle of Liechtra and the subsequent Helot rebellion

 During Alexander's expedition to the east, Aegis III, King of Sparta, sent an army corps to Crete in 333 BC with the intention that the island would be captured for Sparta
 Against Macedon, the Aegis themselves took command of the combined Greek army and in 331 BC
 i also achieved initial successes before being engulfed in the blockade of Megalopolis
 a large Macedonian army-corps led by the commander Antipeter marched to the relief and defeated the Spartan-led army in a fierce battle of thorns
 5300 se bhi adhik spartens evam uske sahyogi is sangram main maare gaye tathaa antipeter kii 3500 sainikon kii tukdi bhi marane waalon main shaamil thi
 The Aegis, now wounded and unable to stand, ordered his men to leave him behind and face the advancing Macedonian army so that he would have some time to retreat from them

 The Athenian commander Xenophon, for example, sent his two sons to Sparta as trophimoi

 anya greek nagar-rajyon main, swatantra naagarik anshkalik senaanee hote the, jo yuddh main vyavahrut nahin hone par anya kaamon main laga die jate the

 According to the description of Thucides: "ek ghoshnaa ke tahat helots ko aamantrit karte hue kaha gaya ki ve apni aabaadi main se un logon ko hi chune jo apane aapako dushman ke khilaaf sabase adhik jane-pahachaane hone kaa daawa karte hai, taaki ve bhi aazaadee ke hakdaar ho sake; makasad keval unki jaanch kerani thi, chunki yah soch liya gaya tha ki aazaadee kaa daawa karne vaala sabase pehla vyakti hi sabase zyada saahsee bahadur or sabase yogya vidrohi maan liya jayega

 sinic ek unani darshan sampradaay, jo samaaj ke prati upeksha tathaa vyaktigat jivan ke prati nishedhaatmak drushti ke liye prasiddh he
 The founder of this sect was Antisthenese
 pehle vah sofist tha
 Later, influenced by Socrates' independent thoughts, altruism and self-denial, he began to consider him his mentor
 yunaan ke janatantr ne sucraat ko jab praan dand de diya, to antistheneez ko vyakti par samaaj kii prabhutaa ke auchity par, phir se vichaar dene ke liye taiyaar na tha ki sucraat ke samaan aatmatyagi vyakti ko prandand de sake
 To fulfill his purpose, he chanted the slogan "walk towards nature"
 us prakritik jivan kii ore sanket kiya, jisamen prayek manushya apane aap kaa swami tha
 Nobody was anybody's slave
 us jivan ko apnaane ke liye, dhan-daulat, sammaan aadi se virakt hone kii aavashyaktaa thi
 Antisthenese gladly accepted it
 kintu, is prakaar ke jivan kaa samarthan karne main vah shiksha, sanskaar, abhivruddhi aadi ke arthon ko lupt nahin hone dena chahta tha
 Therefore, it gave him a moral explanation of the growth of human life
 vah sucraat se prabhavit tha
 Socrates established a causal relationship between knowledge and moral conduct
 is sukaraateey aadarshon ko duhraate hue, antistheneez ne yah dikhaane kaa praytn kiya ki shubhon ke punarmoolyangan main buddhi kii abhivyakti hoti he, aankh muundakar bandhi hui lakiron par chalate rahane main nahin
 The wise person keeps correcting the unsuitable assessment accepted by most of the society from time to time
 apane vichaaron ke samarthan ke vibhinn antistheneez ne saidhantik peethika bhi taiyaar kii thi
 Aflatoon supported the absolute power of the "common" and called the truth of the individual part of the "normal"
 antistheneez ne aflatoon kii is tatvavidya kaa virodh kiya
 He showed that "the common 'has no independent power
" anek vyaktiyon main vyaapt hone se kisi tatv ko "saamaanya' mana jaataa he
 He has no existence apart from individuals
 is prakaar, aflatoon ke saamanyatawad ke viruddh antistheneez ne "namawaad' kii sthapana kii
 He even refuted the "definition dependent on multiplier"
 vah praaia: vastu ko vishisht vastu athwa vyakti maanata tha
 Individuals become the object of decision sentences
 paribhaasha bhi ek prakaar kaa nirnay vaakya he
 However, the general property cannot be a breakdown of a specific object
 is saidhantik peethika par, antistheneez ne vyaktivaadee darshan kaa prarambh kiya jiske anusaar budhimaan vyakti samaaj kaa sadsy nahin, aalochak ho saktaa he
 The credit for furthering Antisthenese's ideas is given to his Shiro Dioginis
 vah kahata tha, "main samaaj kii kuritiyon par bhunkane vaala kutta hoon; meraa kaam prachlit mulyon main uchit maan nirdhaarit karnaa he' inhen donon ke saath sinic sampradaay kaa ant nahin hua
 His tradition continued till the end of Greek philosophy

 In his view, some conscious and impartial reviewers were needed to keep the society on the right path, which should keep revising the accepted values from time to time
 kintu, aise samikshakon ke liye, ve bauddhik vikaas evam naitik aacharan ke saath, nisprihata tathaa samaaj se algaav kii aavashyaktaa ko samajhate the
 In order to do their work properly, Cynic philosophers adopted a special type of living
 ve achche gharon kii, swaadisht bhojan or sukhad vastron kii aavashyaktaa nahin samajhate the
 It is said that Dioginis spent their lives in an old man
 vahi uskaa ghar tha
 Socrates is said to have never worn shoes; Winter, did not change their clothes according to summer
 kintu vah athens nagar main gum-ghumkar, galat kaam karne waalon kii aalochana kiya karata tha
 Being busy in this work, he could never take interest in his ancestral business
 sinicon ne suskuraat ke jivan se shiksha praapt kii thi
 He believed that society can be cautious only by resolving its problems
 sinicon kaa uddeshy samaaj kaa hit karnaa tha; kintu, jis rup main ve apana drushtikon vyakt karte the, usase ve ghor vyaktivaadee tathaa samaaj ke nandak prathit hote the
 Proper subsistence as a sect of Cynic ideals was not possible for long
 antim sinic paristhitiyon ke anusaar jeevanyaapan main sinic aadarshon kii purti maanane lage the
 It was not possible for the successors to be disunited and self-denying as the initial subpoenas
 isiilie, kalantar main sinic kaa saamaanya arth samaaj kii upeksha karne vaala vyakti rah gaya
 But the human element could not cause a complete lack of the Cynic element
 samay-samay par, aise samaaj ke hitchintak hote rahe hai, jo samaaj kii bhrantiyon se kshubdh hokar, ek algaav kaa bhav vyakt karte rahe hai or aisi tikaa tippaniyan karte rahe hai, jinase uchit maarg kaa sanket praapt ho
 The late Bernard Shaw may be called the great twentieth-century Cynic
 unke sahitya main vyaapt saamaajik aalochana, praaia: upeksha kii sataha tak pahunch jaati he kintu, us upekshavriti main antarhit saamaajik hit kaamana bina khoje hue ham "sinic' ke arth tak nahin pahunch sakate

 a long time ago, a moneylender had seven sons and a sister, Karva
 sabhi saaton bhai apni bahan se bahut pyaar karte the
 Even they used to feed him first and then eat themselves
 ek baar unki bahan sasuraal se maayke ai hui thi
 In the evening, when his brother came home after closing his business, he saw that his sister was very distraught
 sabhi bhai khaanaa khaane baithe or apni bahan se bhi khaane kaa aagrah karne lage, lekin bahan ne bataaya ki uskaa aaj karvaa chouth kaa nirjal vrath he or vah khaanaa sirf chandramaa ko dekhakar use arghya dekar hi kha sakati he
 Since the moon has not yet come out, she has become distraught with hunger and thirst
 sabase chote bhai ko apni bahan kii haalat dekhi nahin jaati or vah dur pipal ke ped par ek deepak jalaakar chalani kii oot main rakh detaa he
 Looking at it from a distance, it seems as if the moon of Chaturthi is rising
 iske baad bhai apni bahan ko bataata he ki chaand nikal aayaa he, tum use arghya dene ke baad bhojan kar sakati ho
 Sister happily climbs the stairs and sees the moon, offers her an arrogance and sits down to eat
 vah pehla tukdaa munh main daalati he to use cheenk aa jaati he
 When the second piece is inserted, hair comes out in it and as soon as it tries to put the third piece in the mouth, she gets the news of her husband's death
 vah baukhala jaati he
 Her sister-in-law informs her of the truth as to why this happened to her
 karvaa chouth kaa vrath galat tareeke se tuutane ke kaaran devtaa usase naaraaz ho gaye hai or unhone aisa kiya he
 After getting to know the truth, Karva decides that she will not allow her husband to be cremated and will resurrect her by her persistence
 vah puure ek saal tak apane pati ke shav ke paas baithi rahati he
 Looks after him uske upar ugane vaali sooinuma ghaas ko vah ekatrit karti jaati he
 After a year, the day of Karva Chauth comes again
 uski sabhi bhabhiyaan karvaa chouth kaa vrath rakhti hai
 When sisters-in-law come to seek her blessings, she urges each sister-in-law to 'take Yama Sui, give it to me, make me your own suhagin', but each time the sister-in-law tells her to ask the next sister-in-law
 is
 is prakaar jab chathe number kii bhabhi aati he to karvaa usase bhi yahi baat doharaati he
 This sister-in-law tells her that since her fast was broken because of the youngest brother, her wife only has the power to resurrect your husband, so when she comes, you can hold her until she comes to your husband
 Don't make him alive, don't leave him
 aisa kah ke vah chali jaati he
 At the end comes the younger sister-in-law
 karvaa unase bhi suhaagin banane kaa aagrah karti he, lekin vah taalamatoli karne lagati he
 Seeing this, she is caught by him and asks him to bring his son alive
 bhabhi usase chhudaane ke liye nochati he, khasotati he, lekin karvaa nahin chhodti he
 Finally, seeing her austerity, the sister-in-law exhales and rips her little finger and puts the nectar out of it in her husband's mouth
 karvaa kaa pati turant shriganesh-shriganesh kahata hua uth baithta he
 In this way, Karva gets her honeymoon back through her younger sister-in-law
 he shri ganesh maan gauri jis prakaar karvaa ko chir suhagan kaa vardaan aapse mila he, vaisaa hi sab suhaaginon ko mili
 The essence of this story is that the married daughter of Shakaprasthapur Vedadharma Brahmin, Veeravati, observed the fast of Karva Chauth
 niyamanusaar use chandroday ke baad bhojan karnaa tha, parantu usase bhukh nahin sahi gai or vah vyakul ho uthi
 The distraction of her sister from her brothers was not seen and she spread a beautiful light of fireworks under the cover of Peepal and showed the moon and made Veeravati a meal
 parinaam yah hua ki uskaa pati tatkaal adrishy ho gaya
 The impatient Veeravati fasted each Chaturthi for twelve months and her husband was recaptured by her penance on the day of Karva Chauth
 ek samay kii baat he ki ek karvaa naam kii pativrata stri apane pati ke saath nadi ke kinare ke gaanv main rahati thi
 One day her husband went to bathe in the river
 snaan karte samay vahaan ek magar ne uskaa pair pakad liya
 The man started calling his wife by saying Karva Karva Karva Karva
 uski aawaaj sunakar uski patni karvaa bhaagi chali ai or aakar magar ko kachche dhaage se band diya
 Tied the manger but reached Yamraj and started saying to Yamraj - o God! But my husband has caught my leg
 us magar ko pair pakadaney ke aparaadh main aap apane bal se narak main le jaao
 Yamraj said - yet the age of the manger is left, so i cannot kill him
 is par karvaa boli, agar aap aisa nahin karoge to main aap ko shraap dekar nasht kar duungi
 Hearing this, Yamaraja got scared and came with that husbandry Karva and sent Magar to Yampuri and gave longevity to Karva's husband
 he karvaa mata! jaise tumne apane pati kii raksha kii, vaise sabake patiyon kii raksha karnaa
 Once, Pandu's son Arjuna went to a mountain called Nilgiri to do penance
 idhar draupadi bahut pareshaan thim
 On not receiving any news of him, he meditated on Lord Krishna and expressed his concern
 krishna bhagwaan ne kaha- bahna, isi tarah kaa prashn ek baar mata parvati ne shankaraji se kiya tha
 After worshiping the Moon, food is taken by offering it to the Moon
 sone, chaandi yaa mitti ke karave kaa aapas main aadan-pradaan kiya jaataa he, jo aapasi prem-bhav ko badhaata he
 After worshiping, women salute their father-in-law and elders and seek their blessings
 tab shankaraji ne mata parvati ko karvaa chouth kaa vrath batalaaya
 By observing this fast, women can protect their honeybees from every impending crisis in the same way that a Brahmin did
 prachinkaal main ek brahman tha
 He had four boys and one quality girl
 ek baar ladki maayke main thi, tab karvaa chouth kaa vrath padaa
 He performed the fast methodically
 puure din nirjala rahi
 Nothing was eaten or drank, but all four of his brothers were worried that the sister would be thirsty, hungry, but the sister would take water only after the moonrise
 bhaaiyon se na rahaa gaya, unhone shaam hote hi bahan ko banaavati chandroday dikhaa diya
 a brother climbed a peepal tree with a sieve and lit a lamp and produced light from the sieve
 tabhi duusare bhai ne neeche se bahan ko aawaaj di- dekho bahan, chandramaa nikal aayaa he, pujan kar bhojan grahan karo
 Sister took food
 bhojan grahan karte hi uske pati kii mrityu ho gai
 Now she started to mourn, when Rani Indrani was leaving from there
 unase uskaa dukh na dekha gaya
 The Brahmin girl grabbed his leg and asked the reason for his grief, then Indrani said - You broke the fast of Karva Chauth without seeing the moon, so got this trouble
 ab tu varsh bhar kii chouth kaa vrath niyampurvak karnaa to tera pati jivit ho jayega
 She fasted according to Indrani's saying, then she again got lucky
 isliye prayek stri ko apane pati kii dderghaayu ke liye yah vrath karnaa chahie
 Draupadi did this fast and Arjuna returned back after receiving the desired fruit
 tabhi se hindu mahilaayein apane akhand suhaag ke liye karvaa chouth vrath karti hai
