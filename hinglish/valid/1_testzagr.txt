 lubricant ise kai tareekon se hasil karte hai
 The most common is by the formation of a physical barrier, ie the lubricant separates the moving parts
 ise hydrodinamik lubrication kaha jaataa he
 At high surface pressures or temperatures the fluid layer is very thin and some forces are transmitted to the surfaces through the lubricant
 ise elasto-hydrodinamik lubrication kaha jaataa he
 Lubricant-to-surface friction is generally less than surface-to-surface friction in any system of lubricant
 is prakaar lubricant kaa upyog samgr pranali ke gharshan ko kam kar detaa he
 Low friction has the advantage of low heat generation and low formation of wear particles as well as improved efficiency
 Lubricants may include additives called friction modifiers that chemically bind solid surfaces to reduce surface friction, even when there is insufficient bulk lubricant for hydrodynamic lubrication, e

 donon gas or taral lubricant taap antarit kar sakate hai
 However, liquid lubricants are more effective due to their high specific heat capacity
 aam taur par taral lubricant pranali ke cooler bhaag se or usamen parichaalit hota he, haalanki lubricant kaa istemaal garm tathaa thande karne ke liye ho saktaa he jab niyantrit taapmaana kii aavashyaktaa ho
 yah parisanchari pravaah kisi niyat samay main ikai main dur jane vaale taap kii maatra bhi nirdhaarit karata he
 High flow systems can carry a lot of heat and also have the added benefit of reducing thermal stress on the lubricant
 is tarah kam laagat vaale taral lubricant kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The primary drawback is that large flows typically require large caps and large cooling units
 ek gaun dosha yah he ki ucch pravaah pranali jo lubricant ko thermal tanaav se bachaane ke liye pravaah dar par nirbhar karti he, achaanak pranali ke band hone par vipattipurna vifaltaa ke liye atisamvedansheel he
 a typical example is an automotive oil-cooled turbo charger
 terbocharger sanchaalan ke dauraan garm laal ho jate hai or unhen thanda karne vaala tel batch rahata he kyonki pranali main uskaa rahane kaa samay bahut kam he arthath ucch pravaah dar

 samay ke saath shitalan kam karte hue, ye nikshep tel margon ko puri tarah avaruddh kar sakate hai, jiske parinamswaroop jam beringon ke saath aam taur par terbo charger puri tarah band ho jaataa he
 Non-flowing lubricants such as grease and paste are not effective during heat transfer, although at first they contribute by reducing heat generation
 lubricant sancharan pranaaliyon se aantarik rup se janit malbe or pranali main aane vaale bahya dooshit padaarthon ko dur le jane kaa laabh he, jo filter main pahunchate hai jahaan se unhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 Lubricants for machines that routinely generate debris or contaminants such as automotive engines typically include detergents and dispersed additives to transport and remove debris and contaminants to the filter
 samay ke saath filter bhar jayega or safaai yaa use badalane kii zarurat hogi, atah sifarish kii jaati he ki car main tel badalte samay oil filter bhi badal daalen
 gear box jaisi band pranaaliyon main filter main chumbak anupoorak shaamil ho saktaa he taaki utpann baariq lohe ke chure aakarshith ho jaaen
 It is clear that oil in a communications system can only be as clean as the filter can make it, thus it is unfortunate that no industry standards exist that allow consumers to easily evaluate the filtering ability of various automotive filters
 Can
 Poor filtration specifically reduces the life of the machine as well as disables the system
 hydrolic taral ke rup main gyaat lubricant kaa upyog hydrostatic vidyut sanchaar main kaaryakari taral padaarth ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Hydraulic fluids comprise a large fraction of all lubricants produced worldwide
 swat: sancharan kaa anthan parivartak lubricant ke saath vidyut pareshan ke liye ek or mahatvapurn prayojan he
 Lubricants prevent rubbing by keeping the moving parts separate
 lubricant main ragad-rodhi yaa atyadhik dabaav vaale yojak bhi ho sakate hai jo ragad or shram ke prati unke nishpaadan ko badhaava dete hai
 Generally good quality lubricants are formulated with additives that form chemical bonds with surfaces to prevent corrosion and rusting
 lubricant gatisheel hisson ke bich keshika bal ke zarie nikasi ko gherta he, jisase nikasi band ho jaati he
 This effect can be used to seal pistons and shafts
 romavaasi wagon ke pahiyon ko chikna karne ke liye pashuon kii vasa main duube chithdon kaa istemaal karte the; tathaapi chiknayee kaa vigyaan vastav main keval unnisvin sadi main audyogic kranti ke saath aage badha
 Typically lubricants are made with more base oil and some additives for the required characteristics
 taral lubricanton kii tulana main gasiy lubricant main bahut kam chipchipahat or adhik sampeden hoti he, lekin taral-jhilli siddhant gaison ke samroop lagu hote hai
 Some examples of gaseous lubricants are air, technical gases, steam or liquid-metal vapor
 taral lubricant ke lakshan kai alag tareekon se varnit kiye ja sakate hai
 One of the most common methods is by the type of base oil used
 The following are the most common types
 note: haalanki aam taur par lubricant ek yaa duusare prakaar ke base oil par aadhaarit hai, yah sambhav he ki nishpaadan apekshaaon kii purti ke liye base oil ke mishranon kaa istemaal kiya jaae
 a natural water repellent, lanolin is derived from sheep wool grease and is an alternative to the more common petrochemical-based lubricants
 yah lubricant zang nirodhak bhi he, jo zang, lavan or amlon se raksha karata he
 Water itself can be used, or in combination with any other base oil, as a major component
 saamanytah milling or leath terning jaisi ejineering prakriyaaon main prayukt hota he
 The term is used to describe lubricating base oil derived from crude oil
 american petroleum institute vibhinn prakaar ke lubricant base oil ko nirdisht karata he jinaki nimna rup main pahchaan kii gai he: Such as naphthenics, PAG, esters, etc
 lubricant udyog saamanytah is samooh shabdaawalee ko nimna shaamil karne ke liye vistrut karti he: Can be classified into three categories based on the prevailing structures: ye mukhya rup se paudhon or jaanwaron se praapt triglisride aster hai
 Vegetable derived material is preferred for the use of lubricant base oil
 aam telon main shaamil hai ucch oleik canola tel, arandi kaa tel, palm tel, surajamukhi ke bijon kaa tel, vanaspati se repasid tel or pashu sroton se tol tel
 kai vanaspati telon ko aksar amla kii upaj ke liye hydrlise kiya jaataa he jinhen baad main vishisht synthetic aster banane ke liye chuninda taur par sanyojit kiya jaataa he
 Whale oil has historically been an important lubricant, being used as an abrasive modifier additive for automatic circulating liquid until the late 20th century
 tefflon PTFE aam taur par coating parat ke rup main istemaal kiya jaataa he, udhaaharan ke liye, khaanaa pakaane ke bartan non-stick sataha uplabdh karaane ke liye

 Under extreme pressure, teflon powder or solid is of no value, as it softens and flows away from the contact area
 tab chini mitti yaa dhaatu yaa mishra dhaatu lubricant kaa upyog kiya janaa chahie
 Graphite, hexagonal boron nitride, molybdenum disulfide and tungsten disulfide are examples of materials that can be used as solid lubricants to much higher temperatures than normal
 kuch aisi saamagree kaa upyog kabhi-kabhi unke karaab oxikaran pratirodh dwaara pratibandhit ho jaataa he 
 Metal alloys, composite and pure metals can be used as grease additives or as a single component of sliding surfaces and bearings
 cadmium or sona, satahon par chadhaane ke liye istemaal hote hai jo unhen acha gharshan pratirodh or sarakan gun pradaan karte hai, sisa, tin, zinc mishra-dhaatu or vibhinn kaansya mishra-dhaatuon kaa upyog phisalane vaale bering ke liye istemaal hota he, yaa unke powder ko keval phisalane vaali satahon ko chikna banane ke liye, yaa greezon main yojak ke rup main prayog main laa sakate hai
 Another phenomenon on which research has been done in high temperature breakdown prevention and lubrication is 'layer climbing'
 It is the generation of a solid oxide layer, which normally accumulates at high temperatures, with metal surfaces sliding against each other to form a crystalline 'layer'
 Friction and wear can be reduced due to the avoidance of metal contact and adhesion by the production of oxides
 prabhavi rup se, is tarah kii sataha swa-chiknayee vaali hoti he
 Since the 'layer' is already an oxide, it can survive at very high temperatures in air or oxidizing environments
 tathaapi, aadhaar dhaatu ke liye zaruri hone kii vajah se ise asuvidha he ki paryaapt oxide malba utpann karne ke liye pehle ise tut-foot se guzaranaa hoga
 a large number of additives are used to provide performance characteristics to the lubricant
 yojakon ke mukhya parivaar hai: Note that many basic chemical compounds that are used as detergents also serve as the purpose of the first seven items in the list
 aam taur par aarthik rup se yaa takneekee rup se sab kaam ke liye ek yojak mishran kaa prayog vyavhaarya nahin he

 Lubricant marketers generally follow any or many of the following strategies --- when doing business
 lubricant kathith taur par ek nishchit vinirdesh ko puraa karata he
 In the consumer market, this is often supported by a logo, symbol, or words that inform consumers that the lubricant marketer has done independent verification of conformance to the specification
 iske udaahranon main shaamil hai API kaa donot logo yaa NSF kaa tik mark
 sabase vyapak rup se dekha gaya he SAE chipchipaapan vinirdesan, jaise SAE 10W-40
 chiknayee ke vinirdesh santhaan or nirmaataa aadhaarit hai
 At the American Institute: API s for petrol engines, API C
 for diesel engines
 The current specifications for 2007 are API SM and API CJ
 The higher second letter indicates better oil properties, such as less engine failure supported by tests
 ACEA specifications are used in the European Union
 vahaan shreniyan maujuud hai A, B, C, e akshar kaa anusaran karti sankhyaon ke saath
 japan ne motorbike injanon ke liye JASO vinirdesan pravartit kiya
 In the industrial market, the specification may take the form of a legal contract that supplies the corresponding fluid, or the buyer can choose to purchase based on the manufacturer's own published specifications
 aksar vinirdesh ek nunatam sweekaarya nishpaadan str nirupit karte hai
 Thus many device manufacturers tighten the tolerance on a common specification to add to their specific requirements or to meet their needs
 This gives lubricant marketers the opportunity to differentiate their product by designing to meet the OEM specification
 aksar, OEM vyapak pareekshan karata he or anumodith utpaadon kii sakriy suchi kaa anurakshan karata he
 It is a powerful marketing tool in the lubricant market
 motor oil label ke peeche paath main aam taur par kuch OEM vinirdeshnon kii suchi hoti he, jaise ki MB, MAN, Volvo, Cummins, VW, BMW yaa anya
 vinirmaataaon ke paas unke dwaara nirmit vividh injanon ke liye behad alag vinirdesh ho sakate hai; ek puri tarah se anya ke liye upyukt nahin ho saktaa he
 The lubricant marketer claims benefits for the customer based on the superior performance of the lubricant
 is tarah ke vipanan glamras vigyapanon, khaas khel kaaryakramon ke praayojan or andorsement dwaara samarthit hote hai
 Unfortunately widespread performance claims are common in the consumer market, making verification difficult or impossible for a specific consumer
 B2B bazaar main vipanak se saamanyatya unke daavon kaa samarthan karne vaale data ko darshane kii aashaa kii jaati he, jisase vyapak daavon kaa istemaal kam ho sake
 nishpaadan badhanaa, tut-foot or indhan kaa upbhog ghataana bhi baad ke API, ACEA or car nirmaataaon ke oil vinirdeshnon kaa lakshya rahaa he, jisase lubricant vipanak vyapak pareekshanon dwaara apane daavon kaa samarthan kar sakate hai
 The market claims that their lubricant maintains its performance for a long period
 udhaaharan ke liye upabhokta bazaar main, ek theth motor oil parivartan antaraal lagbhag 3,000–6,000 mile ke aas-paas he
 Lubricant marketers can offer a lubricant that lasts 12,000 miles or more to persuade the user to pay a premium
 aam taur par, upabhokta ko lambey samay or lubricant nirmaataa dwaara prastut varantiyon ko sambhavya upkaran nirmaataa varantiyon kii kshati ke bare main samay-anusuchee kaa anupaalan na karne ke anusaran dwaara jaanchane yaa santulan karne kii zarurat hogi

5 specification oil up to 3x longer
 dhyaan den ki oil dren antaraal car nirmaataa vinirdesh ke anuroop indhan ke saath nae ingine ke liye maanya he
 When low grade fuel is used, or an older engine, the oil change interval should be reduced accordingly
 Common oils approved for extended use are of high specification and minimize spoilage
 audyogic bazaar main dderghaayu ko aam taur par samay kii ikaayiyon main mapa jaataa he or unke daawey pramanit na hone kii sthiti main lubricant vipanak ko baari vittiya jurmaana bhugatna pad saktaa he
 Lubricant marketers claim advanced equipment efficiency compared to anti-products or technologies, a claim that can generally be valid when comparing high-grade lubricants with previous grades
 In general, efficiency is proved by showing a reduction in the cost of energy to operate the system
 unnat dakshata kii guarantee dena, deazal injanon ke liye API CI-4 Plus jaise kuch tel pareekshan vinirdeshon kaa lakshya hota he
 Some car / engine manufacturers also request some higher efficiency levels of lubricant, especially for extended drain intervals
 lubricant ke liye daawa kiya gaya ki vah vishisht parichaalan pariveshon kii jaruraton se nipat saktaa he
 Some common environments include dry, wet, cold, hot, fire risk, high load, high or low speed, chemical compatibility, atmospheric compatibility, pressure or vacuum and various combinations
 The general thermal characteristics are outlined with SAE viscosities given for 100 ° c such as SAE 30, SAE 40

 For example both markings can be joined together to form SAE 0W-60
 chipchipaapan suchakank taapmaana ke saath chipchipaapan parivartan ankit karata he, jahaan ucch VI sankhya adhik taapmaana sthirataa ke liye he
 Marketers offer either the same grade or a similar price at a lower price than rivals, which will serve the purpose for a lower price
 Alternatives are proposing a more expensive lubricant and may promise less spoilage, specific fuel consumption or return at longer drain intervals
 lubricant ko paryaavaran anukool kaha gaya he
 This is generally supported by qualifications of qualifying statements or generally accepted approvals
 duniya bhar main kai sanghathan, aam taur par sarkaar pryojit, aise lubricanton kii paryaavarniya jokhim ke liye unke moolyankan dwaara visheshta bataane or anumodith karne ke liye maujuud hai
 Generally, lubricant manufacturers are permitted to indicate such approval by showing some special mark
 udaahranon main shaamil hai german "blue angil", europea "dezi" paristhitiki label, vaishvik paristhitiki label "GEN mark", nordic, "white swen", japani "arth frendli mark"; sanyukt raashtra america "green sil", canadai "environmental choiz", chini "huaan", singapore "green label" or francisi "NF environment mark"
 Marketers claim a new structure of lubricant that will improve some concrete performance compared to its rivals
 The technology is generally protected through formal patents or other intellectual property protection mechanisms to prevent copying by rivals
 is kshetra main anek daawey bahut saral vipanan gunjaar shabd hai, kyonki unamem se zyaadaatar nirmaataa vishisht prakriyaaon se jude hai lekin pratispardhaa ke liye trademark kaa upyog nishiddh he
 The marketer claims extensive superior quality of its lubricant without factual evidence
 gunvattta prasiddh brands, khilaadi, racing team, kuch peshewar andorsement yaa kuch samaan vyaktiparak daawey ke sandarbh dwaara "siddh" he
 All motor oil labels have signs like "good quality" or "quality additive", the actual comparative evidence is not always there
 yah anumaan he ki sabhi lubricanton kaa 40% maahaul main jari hota he
 Disposal: Recycling, combustion, landfill and release into water can dispose of used lubricant

 Other direct contamination sources include falling off roadways, accidental scattering, natural or man-made disasters and pipeline leakages
 Improvement in filtration technology and processes has now made recycling a viable option
 Generally, various filtration systems remove particulates, additives and oxidation products and obtain the base oil
 prakriya ke dauraan tel kaa parishkaran ho saktaa he
 This base oil is later processed in the same way as virgin base oil, although there is substantial reluctance to use recycled oils as they are considered inferior
 prayukt lubricanton se anshatah vaikum distild base stock ke gun sabhi prakritik telon se behatar hote hai, lekin unki laagat prabhaavashiltaa kai karkon par nirbhar karti he
 Used lubricants can also be used as refinery feedstock to be part of crude oil

 2008 ke uttarardh main, esata antarfalak kaa upyog karne vaale flash drive uplabdh ho gaya
 Compared to USB flash drives, one advantage that an esata flash drive boasts is increased data throughput, which increases the speed of data read and write
 baharhaal, flash drive ke liye esata ke upyog main bhi kuch nuksaan he
 The esata connector was designed primarily for use with external hard disk drives that often included their own separate power supplies
 isliye, USB ke vipareet, ek esata sambandhak, sanketon or data sthanantaran prayojanon ke liye aavashyak, prayog yogya bijli ke alaava anya urja pradaan nahin karata he
 This means that an esata flash drive will still require an available USB port or some other external source of power

 In 1957, Charles Hard Towns and Arthur Leonardo Schavalo at the Bell Laboratory began a serious study on infrared laser
 As the idea developed, the focus shifted from infrared frequencies to more visible light instead
 This concept was originally a " Was referred to as "optical moser
" One year later, Bell Laboratory proposed a monopoly application for the proposed optical moser
 Did i Schawlow and Townes sent a manuscript physical review of theoretical calculations, which was published the same year his paper
 
 In those days Gordon Gould, a graduate student at Columbia University, was working on a doctoral research paper on the energy levels of excited thallium
 Gould and Towns met on the general topic of radiation emissions
 In November 1957, Gould called the "laser" Wrote your thoughts related to the suggestion of using an open resonator which is an important component for future lasers

 He continued to work on his idea and filed a patent application in April 1959
 The US Patent Office rejected his application and This patent was given to the Bell Laboratory in 1960
 It sparked a legal battle that lasted for 28 years and earned scientific reputation and more money
 But i Goold won his first short patent in 1977, but could not claim his first patent victory until 1987, when a federal judge issued him a patent for optically pumped lasers and gas-fired lasers

 a basic understanding of their scripts is necessary to work on computers in Indian languages
 varnanmala main do prakaar ke varna hote hai - swar vavyanjan
 Consonants are characters that cannot be pronounced as a single unit without the help of vowels, while vowels can be pronounced independently or by adding consonants
 udhaaharan ke liye yadi ham `k'varna kaa akele uccharan karen to usamen vyanjan dhwani `k' ke saath swar dhwani`a' avashya hogi
 While the vowel sound 'A' can be pronounced independently
 bolte samay ham vaakya yaa shabd main aanevaali dhvaniyon ko shrinkhalaaroop main uccharit karte hai
 If we write these accented sounds sequentially with the help of consonant vowels, then the Hindi word 'kamala' will be written in this way: yahan par, prayek vyanjan evam swar ko alag alag likhaa gaya he
 The feature in this writing method is that the spelling consonants and vowels are written according to the pronunciation
 jab shabd main uccharit dhvaniyon ko varnon dwaara uccharan kram main likhajata he tab is paddati ko varnatmak chihnavali kehete hai
 Descriptive markings are easy to understand and can be considered as the first natural step in the direction of scripting the language
 yah tankan keliye bhi upyukt he
 But its drawback is that it has to write more, due to which both the time and paper cost more
 angreji kiroman lipi ek varnatmak chihnavali he
 In English the 'kamala' soundtrack would be written as follows: k a m a l a In order to overcome the above deficiencies of descriptive markings, alphabetic signs have been developed in Indian languages
 iske antargat prayek swarant syllable ke liye ek chihn coupyog hota he jise akshar kehete hai
 Vowel syllable means zero, the alphabet consisting of vowels after one or more consonants
 udhaaharan ke liye, nimnlikhit varna-kram swarant-syllable hai:- At the end of the word, even if the vowels are not in the order of the final consonants, they can be written as letters; For example, in Hindi, the vowel of the last consonant of the word is not pronounced, but in writing there is the use of the full letter
 jaise : camel
 Hence, the letter represents one or more characters
 akshar kii sanrachana main ek aham baat yah he ki akshar kaa aakaar vyanjan vaswaron kii matraaon ke aakaar se milakar banataa he 
 So it is easy to learn them
 
 Some simple examples of descriptive and alphabetical signs are: isamen mukhya baat yah he ki vyanjan ke saath `a' swar ko jod kar ek "saral"akshar bana diya gaya
 For example: Here 'A' symbol is a simple letter Kajo 'K' is formed by mixing consonants and non-intangible vowels
 is chihnavali ke antargat vyanjanon main swaron ke yojan ke liye matraonka vikaas hua
 If a consonant is followed by a vowel other than 'A', a small special sign is placed on the letter indicating the vowel
 isi chihn ko us swar kii maatra kehete hai, jaise `u' kii maatra `u',`e' kii maatra `e', `i' kii maatra `i' ityadi
 There is no need for any additional markings when the 'a'swara comes after the consonant
 udaahranarth, Consider the difference of 'key' and 'many' in the above
 `kii' main `k' par `i' swar kii maatra he jabaki `kai' main `k' or `i' aksharkrambaddh rup main hai
 Hence, quantities are marked on a letter whether the letter is simple or compound
 har maatra ko lagane ke liye vishisht sthaan hai,jo ki akshar ke chaaron ore hai
 like:- akshar ke baayin ore 'i' kii maatra aati he, isi prakaar se 'e' va 'i'matraayen upar aati hai, 'u' va 'uu' neeche tathaa anya daayin ore
 This method is very beneficial for handwriting
 parantu tankan kii drushti se kuch kathinaaiyaanaati hai, jinka ullekh ham baad main karenge
 By doing this, writing becomes very simple
 haan, seekhney kii drushti se thodi si mehnatazyada he, chunki ab matraaon ko bhi siikhnaa padataa he
 One consequence of this invention is that in order to indicate the absence of 'A' in a simple letter, a special quantity has to be applied, which we say udaahranarth, `kya' shabd main `k' akshar par halant lagaana padataa he: The second key point is that when consonants in a word come one after the other, they are written by adding them together, which is also called conjunct
 ageanevaale swar ke anuroop maatra isi sanyuktakshar par lagati he
 For example, the word 'what' has the pure consonant 'k' and the letter 'y' which are joined by order to make the word 'kya' conjunct
 tatpashchaat saadhaaran niyam ke anusaar us par`aa' kii maatra lagaai jaati he
 Historically, this type of compound is syllabic — a sign of nothing less than a revolution
 yahi hamaari parichit aadhunik lipi he
 The rule of quantifying in an alphabetical sign applies the same to both simple and compound letters
 matlab yah he ki akshar chahesaral ho yaa sanyukt, matraupar die gaye niyamanusaar hi lagegi
 That is, the quantity of 'E' seems to be on the left side as per the rules, then it will be placed on the left side in both types of letters, such as: -a + e = a + e = ki
 or yahi niyam sanyuktakshar par bhi lagu hota he, jis karanvash `i'kii maatra sanyuktakshar ke baayin ore likhi jaaegi
 Note the conjunct in the Sanskrit word 'tasmin' given below: - 'i' maatra 'm' ke baayin ore na hokar, sanyuktakshar 'sm' ke baayin oralagati he, jo niyamanusaar he
 Each letter is taken as a marking unit under the rule of applying quantities
 akshar apane aap main swar ke bina adhooraahe
 a simple letter is the sum of just one vowel, or one consonant + one vowel, and the ligature is the sum of more than one consonant and one vowel
 matraaon ko lagane ke niyamon ke samaan hi vyanjanon ko jodakar sanyuktaksharbanane ke liye bhi saral kintu vishesh niyam hai:- vyanjanon ko baayen se daayen,yaa upar se neeche kii ore joda jaataa he
 In which the first consonant in the sequence is left or up
 baayen se daayen ke udhaaharan ham dekh hi chuke hai jaise,'ky','sm' ityadi, upar-neeche jodne ke udhaaharan neeche diye hue hai:- Since 'D' comes after 'D' in the above, 'D' is written above and 'D' is written
 sanyuktakshar banaate samay, dwitiya vyanjan ke chihn ko daayin ore likhaa jaae yaneeche, yah is baat par nirbhar karata he ki un vyanjanon kaa rup kaisaa he
 It is easy to connect them according to the look
 yadi dononvyanjanon ke chihnon main khadi-pai nahin he to dwitiya ko pratham ke nichelikha jaataa he, jaise 'tth'
 There are some special rules with 'R' which are made in terms of brevity
 yah niyam sanyuktakshar ke kram main `r' ke sthaan par nirbhar karte hai
 If 'R' is in the second place and there is a consonant before it and a vowel after it, while making the conjunct, a special symbol is given below the first consonant for 'su': - isi prakaar yadi `r' ke baad vyanjan he to us vyanjan ke upar ek visheshchihn laga diya jaataa he: Therefore, in the conjunct, 'su' comes up first when in consonant and comes down after it
 hamaari lipi main ek or tarika he sankshiptata se likhane kaa:- yah he anuswaraka prayog
 For the final consonant in the class of each consonant, anusvar can be used, such as: - vyanjanon kii nasikyata ke liye anuswaar kaa prayog hotahai tathaa swaron kii nasikyata ke liye anunasik kaa prayog hota he
 for example: inamen chandrabindu to swaron kii nasikyata ko chihnit karata he parantubindu kaa ekmaatr uddeshy lipi main sankshiptata laana he
 It is necessary to say here that from the language point of view it is correct to analyze only through pure consonants and pure vowels
 ISCII maankanusaar computer menantarik taur par aksharatmak chihnavali main hi lekh rakhaa jaataa he
 It also includes quantities
 parantu bhashaa sansaadhan ke liye, unako hataakar shuddhvyanjan va swar main aasaani se parivartit kiya ja saktaa he
 Rules like Anusvar are also in other Indian languages
 ek si varnanvyavastha tathaa aksharatmak lipi hone se sabhi bhartiya bhashaaon main ek samaantahai
 Computerization of other Indian languages is easy when the script of one language is computerized
 jo takanic ek par lagaai gai ho, vah duusari bhashaonke computarikaran main bhi kaam main aa sakati he
 For example, Gist Technology works simultaneously in all Indian languages scripts on computers
 computer main tankan karne ke liye kunjeepatal kaa prayogkia jaataa he, jiskaa design hamaari ungliyon ke aakaar va haath kii lambaai paranirbhar karata he
 Therefore, there cannot be excessive changes in the shape and size of the keys
 zyada kunjiyaan hone par kunjiyon ko dhundhna va yaad rakhana kathinho jaataa he
 Therefore, typing a ligature with the same key is difficult
 computer ke aane se purv bane masini tiperiter par tankankarne main anekon kathinaaiyaan aati thim
 Firstly, if we want the typed material to appear in alphabetical signs, then it is mandatory to type it in the same markings
 atah sanyuktakshar sahit anekon chihnon kokunjeepatal par yaad rakhana padataa tha
 Second, since quantities can come around the letter, making such a machine was a complex task, and the output did not look beautiful
 in sab ko dekhte hue computer praudyogiki main yah sochaa gayaaki agar ham tankan to varnatmak chihnavali main kar saken, par computer screenpara parichit aksharatmak chihnavali dikh padey to acha hoga
 Successful development of this technology has been done with this as the basis
 ye sab kamiyaan computer ke aagmanase samaapt ho gai hai
 But it is necessary that we understand the interrelationship in descriptive and alphabetical signs
 man main yah prashn bhi uth saktaa he ki tankan ke liye yadi varnatmak lipi koman liya jaataa to ye sari pareshaaniyaan dur ho jaatin
 But since alphabetic script was prevalent in handwriting, it was not thought to use descriptive script
 yah ek udhaaharan he, jahaan ek behatar vigyaan honeke kaaran, praudyogiki kaa upyog nahin kiya gaya kyonki vah abhi us strapar nahin pahaunchi thi
 Probably, for this reason, the circulation of the raid was not as uprooted as it should have been
 is praudyogiki ko upyog main na laane se jo hamen haani hui vah sarv-viditahai
 Perhaps this was also one of the reasons that Europe overtook us in science
 in baton ke bare main ab keval anumaan hi lagaaya ja saktaa he, nischitarup se kuch kahana kathin he
 The question may arise that if the letter is a sum of pure consonants and vowels, then what is quantity? Why is m + e = Egypt, why is 'M_' not? These are given below in the form of a unitary equation
 yahan maatra va swar chihnon ke sambandh ko ham ek ganitiya sameekaran ke rupamen dekhenge
 We have seen many examples of signs including quantity and without quantity
 jaise:- We also know that 'A' can be broken into pure consonants and vowels: - uparokt 'k' ke mulya ko sameekaran main daahine ore rakhaa ja saktaa he:- Similarly, 'Q' can be subtracted from both sides of the equation, just as 8 is reduced in the mathematics example
 tathaa donon ore se `k' ko hataane par ham pate he:- The above is an important equation, which gives the value of the 'I' vowel as its quantity
 uparokt main, 'i' swar kaa mulya matraaon main likhaa gaya he
 Now we will display the value of quantity in tone
 pehle dekhaten hai ganit ke sameekaran ko
 In the left part of the equation, if we add zero, we get: - ab yadi 0 ke sthaan par rakhen:- 1 + to:- Similarly, now let us see how the volume is related to its tone
 iskaa pataa lagane ke liye hamen lipi ke shunya kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 We know that Halant subtracts 'A', namely: - ab sameekaran main baayi ore ke hisse main `k' ke baad shunya jodne se hamemiltaa he:- By subtracting 'A' from both sides, yaa, ise aise bhi likh sakate hai:- This equation shows that the value of quantity 'E' is the solitary deposit 'E'
 arthath, 'i' main halant nihit he tathaa vah apane se purv akshar main se `a'ko ghataata he
 The same thing said above for 'E', the same thing applies for other quantities as well
 atah :- Halant is in a way a negative object, just like a negative number
 jis prakaar rinatmak sankhya koek dhanatmak sankhya main jodne par dhanatmak sankhya kaa maan kam ho jaataa he,usee prakaar se halant ko apane se purv akshar main jodne par usamen se 'a'ghat jaataa he
 The use of Halant is a specialty of Indian languages
 halant kaavishkaar bharat main hua, tathaa kadachit is prakaar kii avadharana anya kisibhasha main nahin he
 In India, there has been a special work on language, just as on geometry in Greece
 bharat ne vishwa ko shunya ki avadharana di,tathaa is sabko dekhte hue lagata he ki yah aashcharya kii baat nahin hogi yadibharat main shunya kii avadharana bhashaa main viksit hokar ganit main gai ho

 Scalp cooling can be used for some types of chemotherapy treatments to reduce hair loss
 aisi koi vajah nahin he ki sambhog se parhez kiya jaae, lekin ham condom istemaal karne kii salaah dete hai
 It is possible that some part of the chemotherapy is in the fluid coming out of your body, so in this case the use of condoms will protect your partner
 yah jaruri he ki apane upachaar ke dauraan athwa upachaar ke baad kam se kam chah maheene tak aap garbhadhaaran na karen yaa yadi aap purush hai to apane saathi ko garbhvatee hone den

 aapke upachaar ke kai dinon baad tak aapke sharir ke drav padaarthon main kuch ansh main chemotherapy ke tatv maujuud ho sakate he
 Although the risk of harm from this is very low, it is important that others are exposed to chemotherapy
 isliye hamaari yah salaah he ki aap toilet kaa istemaal karne ke turant baad pani chalaa den or apane haath acchhee tarah se dhoen
 You should wear rubber gloves if the body fluids have spread or your hands are stuck on them
 chemotherapy upachaar karaane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki aap apane parivaar or doston ke saath kareebi sambandh nahin rakh sakate
 This includes kissing and hugging
 chemotherapy karaane vaale sabhi rogiyon ko flu hone kaa khatra hota he
 If you are undergoing chemotherapy in the autumn or winter, then you are advised against immunization from the flu
 uchit yah hoga ki aap apana chemotherapy upachaar shuru hone ke 7-10 din pehle hi tikaa lagava len
