 Pranayama is one of the eight organs of yoga
 pranayam = praan + aayam
 It literally means 'to prolong life' or 'to prolong life'
 hathyogpradipika main kaha gaya he- It is also said- pranayam do shabdon ke yoga se bana he- pehla shabd "praan" he doosraa "aayam"
 The meaning of Prana which gives us strength or strength
 aayam kaa arth jaanane ke liye iskaa sandhi viched karnaa hoga kyonki yah do shabdon ke yoga se bana he
 It has the root word "yam" and "A" prefix
 yam kaa arth 'gaman hota he or '"aa" ' upsarg 'ulataa ' ke arth main prayog kiya gaya he arthath aayam kaa arth ulataa gaman hota he
 Hence the dimension in Pranayama is used in the sense of 'inverse movement'
 is prakaar pranayam kaa arth 'praan kaa ulataa gaman hota he
 It is to be noted here that pranayama is the noun of the particular action of movement, not the result
 arthath pranayam shabd se praan ke vishesh kriya kaa bodh hona chaiye
 Many sages have said about Pranayama in their own way but all have the same feeling like Pranayajali Sutra of Patanjali and Pranayam Sutra of Gitanjali in which Pranayam Sutra is considered important which is as follows- Tasmin sati breathing breaths Its Hindi translation will be like this- Pranayama is the separation of the speed of breathing
 is sutara ke anusaar pranayam karne ke liye sabase pehle sutara kii samyak vyakhya honi chaiye lekin patanjali ke pranayam sutara kii vyakhya karne se pehle hame is baat kaa dhyaan dena chaiye ki patanjali ne yoga kii kriyaaon evam upaayen ko yogasutra naamak pustak main sutara rup se sankalit kiya he or sutara kaa arth hi hota he -ek nishchit niyam jo ganitiya evam vigyaan sammat ho
 If the formula is not explained correctly, the answer is far from true and the result will be zero
 yadi patanjali ke pranayam sutara ke anusaar pranayam karnaa he to sabase pehle unke pranayam sutara tasmin sati shwasaprashwasayorgativiched:pranayam
 kii samyak vyakhya honi chaiye jo shastranusaar, vigyaan sammat, taarkik, evam ganitiya ho
 Action has to be done according to this interpretation
 iske liye sutara main prayukt shabdon kaa arthbodh hona chaiye tathaa usamen di gayi gati viched kii vishesh yukti ko jaananaa hoga
 For this, the words used in the Pranayama Sutra of Patanjali should be understood
 shwaas ko dhimi gati se gahari khinchakar rokna va baahar nikaalnaa pranayam ke kram main aata he
 With breathing, feel that the life force, superiority is being drawn in by breathing, while exhaling feel that our bad, vicious feelings, bad thoughts are coming out with exasperation
 ham saans lete he to sirf hawa nahin khichate to uske saath brahmand kii sari urja ko usame khinchate he
 Now you will feel how it will happen just by breathing

 Suppose the breath that makes your entire body move, it also has the power to repair your body

 china-nepal yuddh yaa gorkha-china yuddh nepaliyon dwaara 1788-1792 main tibet ke upar ek chadhai thi
 This war was completely fought over the coinage dispute between the Nepali and Tibetan armies
 nepaliyon dbaara saste dhaatuon ke mishran ko dhalkar banaaye gayi sikke jo lambe samay se tibet ke liye pareshaani kaa sabab bana hua tha
 The Nepalis had subdued the Tibetans, who were subordinate to China
 tibet ne kerudaki sandhi kii or shaanti samjhauta ke anuroop vaarshik salaami deneka vaada kiya
 Later, Tibet lied and invited the King of China
 commander phukaagan nepalke betravati tak aage lekin jabardast countetack ke kaaran china ne shaanti samjhauta ke prastaav sweekaar kiya
 Nepalese silver coins were used in Tibet since the time of the Malla dynasty of Nepal
 jab prithvi narayan shah ne apane ekikaran kaal main kathmandu ghati main aarthik len-dein band kar diya tab kathmandu ke raja jai prakaash mall ko bahut bade aarthik sankat kaa saamana karnaa padaa, is sankat ko dur karne ke liye unhonen tanba ko duusare dhaatu ke saath galaakar nimna str ke sikke banane ki koshish kii
 Later, Prithvi Narayan Shah successfully captured the Kathmandu Valley in 1769 and completely established the Shah dynasty in Nepal, he again began to bring pure silver coins into circulation
 lekin tab tak nepali sikkon par se bharosa uth chukaa tha
 The demand of the Tibetans was to replace those coins with pure silver coins that were already in circulation and not of pure silver, a demand that was too large for the newly established Shah dynasty to deal with large financial finance losses
 was
 prithvi narayan shah is baat ke liye jimmedaar nahin the itane bade ghate ko sahane ke icchhuk nahin the lekin vah naye chaandi ke sikke kii shuddhta ke liye vishwasaneeyata ke icchhuk the
 Thus, two types of coins were in circulation in the market
 yah maamla bina sulajhe 1775 ke ant tak yu hi chalata rahaa or yah samasya uttaradhikaar main nepal ke kramik shaasha ko milti gayi
 In 1788, Prithvi Narayan Shah's elder son Bahadur Shah and his uncle and state representative Rana Bahadur Shah inherited a serious coin problem
 nakli sikko kii daleel par, tibetiyon ne yah afvaah failaana shuru kar diya ki nepal akraman karne ki sthiti main he; or tibet main rah rahe byapaariyon ko tibet pareshaan karne lage
 The second sad point of the nepal-tibet relationship was the refusal of the 10th Shamarpa Lama, Mipam Chadrup Gyamtso and his 14 followers
 vah dharmik or rajnatik karno se tibet se bhaag kar nepal chalaa gaya tha
 The second link of the conflict was the salt of the lower quality which was distributed by Nepal to Nepal
 us samay nepal main namak tibet se hi aayaa karata tha
 a delegation from Nepal was sent to Tibet to settle the dispute, but the demand for the delegation was rejected by Tibet
 is tarah nepal ko tibet ke saath sambandh rakhane main koi ichha nahin rahi or nepal ne kai dishaao se tibet par hamalaa bol diya
 
 1789 main bahadoor shah ne damodar pandey or bam shah ke sanyukt netritv main tibet par akraman karne ke liye gorkha sainik ko tibet bheja
 Gorkha soldiers entered Tibet via Kuti and reached Tashilhunbo
 ek ugr dal shikaarjong main ladaa jahaan tibet ko buree tarah se haar manani padi
 Then Tessu Lama and Shakia Lama requested the Gorkha party for peace talks
 tab gorkha dal ne unhe chhod diya or kuti or kerrung ki ore prasthaan kiya
 When the Emperor of China heard that the Gorkha troops had attacked Tibet, a large contingent of Chinese troops was sent under the command of General Chanchu
 general chanchu sthiti kaa jayja lene khud tibeti lamas ke paas pahunchaa
 He decided that he would remain here until this dispute was resolved
 tibet or nepal ke pratinidhi shanti vaarta ke liye kerrung main 1790 main mili
 In this dialogue, it was informed that Tibet was responsible for this quarrel and hence Tibet will also compensate for the damage done in the war and as a tribute to Tibet, Salana will give 50,001 rupees to Nepal and Nepal will also give the territory occupied in the war to Tibet
 Will give back to nepali pratinidhi ko pratham bhugtan ke rup main tibet dbaara 50,001 rupee diye gayi taaki unka arjit kshetra unhe waapas mil jaae
 And Nepal returned the territory of Tibet - Kerung, Kuti, Longa, Jhunga and Falak to them
 par tibet sandhi ke is shart par adhik dinon tak nahin chal sakaa
 He refused to give the compensation of Rs 50,001 in the second year itself
 or yahi inkaar nepal-tibet yuddh 2 kaa natijaa bana
 Just as Tibet refused to pay compensation of Rs
50
001, Bahadur Sah sent a troop of troops to Kerung under the leadership of Abhiman Singh Basnett and another troop led by Damodar Singh in 1791
 damodar pandey ne digarch par hamalaa bolaa or raja ki sampati ko apane adhin kar liya
 He also imprisoned Lhasa minister Dhoren Kazi and returned to Nepal with him
 jaise hi yah khabar china ke samraat ke kaanon main padi usne phukaagan ke netritv main sainik ki ek vishaal toli jisamen 70,000 sainik thea ko tibet ke bachaav main bheja

 The imperial armies of the Emperor King responded to Nepal by military responses

 The Nepalese army tried to attack the invasion of the Qing army, but they had faced the odds before

 After successes in successive battles, the Chinese forces faced a very major event that forced them to retreat when they attempted to cross the Betravati river which is near Gorkha Palace in Nuwakot
 During the rainy season the river Barhit was filled with water
 jaise hi chini sena nuvakot ke najadik betravati nadi ke dakshin pahaunchi, nepali sena ke liye kathmandu main unka intjaar karnaa bahut hi mushkil ho rahaa tha
 On 19 September 1792, when the Chinese army was resting on the banks of the Betravati river, the Nepalese army, numbering less than 200, retaliated at Jeetpur Fedi where the troops were stationed

 a deadlock had emerged and how long they could continue their tactical campaign on the low or emerging uncertainty on the western border, so the Gorkhali signed a treaty on the condition of China that there was a demand along with another demand Nepal will also send honors to China every five years
 
 King Commander General Phukagan sent a proposal to the Government of Nepal asking for the approval of the peace treaty
 bahadoor shah khud bhi china ke saath sauhardpurn sambandh rakhana chaahate thea
 He agreed to accept the offer and in 1792 the Treaty of Friendship was concluded at Betraval

 yah upanyaas disambar 1815 main pehle-pahal prakashit kiya gaya tha
 Like her other novels, in this novel, Austen explores the difficulties and concerns of the lives of noble women living in the Georgian-regency of England; She also presents a lively 'courtesy-farce' through her characters
 upanyaas shuru karne se pehle austen ne likhaa, "main ek aisi nayika chunane vaali hum jise koi or nahin balki main khud sabase zyaada pasand karuungi
" pehle hi vaakya main unhone sheershak paatr ko "sundar, chatur or rais yema woodhouse" ke naam se parichay karaayaa

 Emma consoles Harriet and a new visitor to Highbury - Mr

 lekin yema ko frank khushmizaaj lagata he or vah gaur karti he ki frank uski apni taraf aakarshith he

 In fact, Frank and Jane are secretly engaged and Frank pretends to be attracted to Emma in order to hide her true desire

 Emma becomes worried that this will break Harriet, but she soon realizes that Harriet actually likes Naitley, not Frank

 With this disclosure by Harriet, Emma begins to feel disturbed and sad and realizes that she is in love with Naitley

 Her mother died when she was very young and after the marriage of her elder sister, she definitely became the mistress of the house

 Henry Woodhouse is Emma's father, who is always concerned about his health and well-being, even allowing him to make no mistake about himself, nor in the health and well-being of his friends

 Emma Woodhouse is Austen's first heroine with no money concerns and she mentions the gullible Miss Smith that she is not interested in getting married
 yah baat austen ke anya upanyaason se hatakar he, kyonki unki anya kahaniyon main akasar shaadi or aarthik suraksha mahatvapurn vishay rahe hai
 The fact that Emma has enough money makes the novel a bit lighter than Austen's novels such as 'senses and Sensibility' and 'pride and Prejudice'
 iske vipareet main, jine pherfaques kaa bhavishya kuch dhundhala nazar aata he
 Like other Austen heroines, Emma's romantic attraction is not affected
 Like Marion Dashwood, who was attracted to the wrong person before settling down with the right man, Emma does not show any romantic interest in the men in her life
 She is really surprised when Mr
 Elton expresses his love for her - just as Elizabeth Bennett's cynical reaction is flattering Mr
 To Collins
 His longing for Frank Churchill is not a longing for romantic love in the true sense, but a desire for a short, interesting period in life
 gaur karne vaali baat he ki yema, heriyet smith or robert martin ke bich panpate pyaar ko pahchaan nahin paati or bhavi jivan saathi ko sirf dhan-daulat or saamaajik mahattvakankshaon ke aadhaar par aankati he
 When Harriet Smith When she expresses her feelings towards Naitley, Emma goes to Mr
 One realizes his own feelings towards Knightley
 haalanki yema austen kii anya hiroinon se in do baton main alag he, par ek baat main elizabeth benet or bin aliot se milti-julati he ki vah ek hoshiyaar or samajhadaar mahila he jiske paas karne ke liye na koi kaam-dham he or na hi vah apni dincharya yaa apni jagah badalane kii kshamta rakhti he
 Although she enjoys family affection and financial security, Emma's day-to-day life is truly boring and boring; At the beginning of the novel, he has no partner who is of his age

 12) in teenon shabdon ke arth ke vishay main vidwaanon main matbhed he
 The commentator Sayan equates these three words with certain mantras of the Atharvaveda
 atharvaveda ke 20wein cond, 127wein sookt kaa 12vaan mantra gaatha; isi sookt kaa 1-3 mantra narashansi tathaa 4-6 mantra raibhi batalaaya gaya he
 Doctor Oldenburg considers this equation to be faulty in the view of the Rigveda, but in the view of Dr
 Bloomfield, this equation has been accepted in the Rakha Samhita
 brahman samhita ke anushilan se gaatha ke lakshan or swaroop par paryaapt prakaash padataa he
 In the eyes of Aitareya Brahmana, the saga deals with human beings in a variety of mantras, while Ritch belongs to Dev
 arthath gaatha maanviya hone se or rich daivi hone se paraspar bhinn tathaa pruthak mantra he
 This fact is confirmed by the word Shatagatham used for the Shun: Shep narrative, as Shun: Shep was a human being by being the son of a sage Ajigarta, whose story is given in many Suktas in the Rigveda
 in sookhton ke mantron kii sankhya sau ke aasapaas he isaliye aitarey brahman kii drushti main gaatha shabd manushya tathaa manuyochit vishyon ke dyotak mantra ke liye spashtat: prayukt hua he
 Aitareya considers the Aranyaka saga to be a type of different and separate mantra from Ritch and Kumbya which gives sufficient indication of the saga being composed
 varnya vishay kii drushti se gaathaayen, yadhyapi dharm se sambhddha vishyon kii abhivyakti ke kaaran dharmik hi hai, parantu vedon ke saanskarik sahitya main rich yajush tathaa saaman kii tulana main avaidic kahi gai hai arthath is yug main ye mantra nahin maani jaatin
 The Maitrayani Samhita states that the saga provides joy at the time of marriage and many gathas have been given in the Grihyasutras which were sung on Veena on the auspicious occasion of marriage

 The Satapatha Brahmin also has such donative stories safe
 pichley yug main gaatha tathaa narashansi richaayen praaia: samanarthak hi maani jane lageen, parantu mulat: donon main parthaky he
 The saga is the general designation of lyrical mantras under which it is perfectly justifiable to assume the presence of Narasanshi
 is tathy kii pushti aitarey aaranyak ke sayan bhashya se hoti he
 Sayan has given an example of the saga of Pratahr Anatrante Vdanti here in the morning, which is clearly not Narasanshi
 gaatha kii bhashaa vaidic mantron kii bhashaa se bhinn he
 There is a complete absence of odd grammatical forms of Veda and the simplification of verses is expressly expressed
 gaathaon ke katipay udaahranon se yah spasht ho jaataa he : This mantra has come under the famous Kutap Sukta, but its style and type of theme are proving it saga
 aitarey brahman main raja dushyant ke putr bharat se sambhddha gaatha main : Here, despite being named as Shloka, it is in the ancient saga which goes on to the Puranas derived from the tradition
 aisi kitni hi gaathaayen brahman granthon main udadhrut kii gai he
 In Jainism and Buddhism, Padya Gatha is also famous for presenting the findings of the teachings of Mahavira and Gautama Buddha
 jain gaathaayen ardhamagadhi main tathaa buddha gaathaayen pali bhashaa main hai
 We cannot deprive them of the pride of being the mouth-watering words of those great men
 tathagat kii aisi hi upadeshmayi gaathaon kaa lokapriy sangrah dhammapad he tathaa jaatakon kii katha kaa saar prastut karanevaali gaathaayen praaia: prayek jataka ke ant main uplabdh hoti hi hai
 Like the Sanskrit Arya, the saga in Pali and Prakrit also signifies a specific verse
 thergatha tathaa therigatha kii gaathaon main ham sansar ke bhoga vilaas kaa parityag kar sannyast jivan bitaanevaale theron tathaa theriyon kii maarmik anubhutiyon kaa sankalan pate hai
 The recent Gaha Sattasai Prakrit has a very fine Manjul and Saras collection of books, but the relationship of the saga is also very intimate in the Avesta treatise of the Parsis

 radha-krishna kii yugalopasna ko pratishthapit karne vaale nimbarkacharya kaa pradurbhaav karthik poornima ko hua tha
 According to the belief of devotees, the emergence of Acharya Nimbarka is said to be contemporary with Krishna's great-grandson Bajranabha and Parikshit's son Janamejaya in the post-kaal period

 He was born in Arunashran of Vaiduryapatna

 At the time of birth, he was named Niyamanand and settled in Braj during his childhood

 This boy was very miraculous since childhood
 ek baar govardhan sthit inke ashram main ek divabhoji yeti aayaa
 Naturally, the scriptures were discussed but a lot of time was spent in it and it was sunset

 Since then, this child has been named 'nimbark', that is, the person who brings out extracts on the nimbus

 'freedom category' is used in many areas, which are given below- hindi aandolan bharat main hindi evam devanagari ko vividh saamaajik kshetron main aage laane ke liye vishesh praytn hai
 It started at the time of Bharatendu Harishchandra
 is aandolan main sahityakaron, samajaseviyon kaa vishesh yogadan tha
 During the time of Bharatendu, the situation of Hindi had become very critical

 Many people think that the new language 'urdu' was born after the Muslims came to India
 aisa nahin he
 No new language was born after the Muslims came to India
 do dharmon ke paas aane se koi nayi bhashaa janm nahin leti
 Muslims had also invaded Europe and fought with them for hundreds of years, but no new language was born there
 musalamaanon kaa bharat main pravesh aathvin shatabdi se hi armbh ho gaya tha kintu 'urdu' ne atharahavin shatabdi ke ant main hi saamne aayaa or janapadiya boliyon ke shabdon ke vyavhaar kaa bahishkaar isi samay hua jab bharat par angrejon kii pakad majboot ho rahi thi
 It is also not necessary that those of the same religion speak the same language
 arab, iran, turki teenon musalmaan desh hai kintu teenon kii bhashaayen alag-alag hi nahin, teen bhinn pariwaron kii hai
 When we consider what changes occurred in the languages and culture of Muslims in India, then these questions must be asked - Where did these Muslims live? What was his mother tongue? The Muslims who ruled in Delhi were neither Iranians nor Arabs

 Unlike Bangla, Marathi, Telugu, Sanskrit was despised in Urdu
 urdu main jitne arabi shabd angrejon ke raaj main aaye utane musalamaanon ke raaj main bhi nahin aaye the
 'urdu is a different language', 'even on the basis of religion, they are formed' - these ideas were propagated only in the British Raj, not during the rule of Muslims

 Bharatendu has such an epoch-making significance that he recognized the cultural needs of his region; He struggled for Hindi; Strengthened his behavior in socio-cultural life; By ending the process of matrukat, he inspired Hindi to follow the same path on which Bangla, Marathi, Telugu etc
 were already growing
 hindi kaa vikaas hamaare rashtriya jivan ke liye aavashyak or aprihaary tha
 Cultural development of the vast Hindi region was not possible through Urdu
 san 1928 main khwaja hasan nijaami ne quran kaa hindi anuwaad karaayaa to unhone bhoomika main bataaya ki uttar bharat ke adhikansh musalmaan hindi jaanate hai, urdu nahin
 The Hindi movement that Bhartendu started was also useful for Muslims and not only for Hindus; Just like Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and Rabindranath Thakur's bungalow service was for all Hindus and Muslims

 With the advice of the Amatya Council, he not only governed his kingdom, but also expanded the boundaries of his kingdom by establishing a strong army and navy of Nishad Bhils
 mahabharat main varnit katha ke anusaar eklavya dhanurvidya seekhney ke uddeshy se dronacharya ke ashram main aayaa kintu nishadputra hone ke kaaran dronacharya ne use apana shishy bananaa sweekaar nahin kiya
 Frustrated, Eklavya went to the forest
 usne dronacharya kii ek murti banaai or us murti ko guru maan kar dhanurvidya kaa abhyaas karne laga
 He became very adept in archery within a short period of time doing spiritual practice
 ek din pandav tathaa kaurav rajkumaar guru dron ke saath akhet ke liye usee van main gayi jahaan par eklavya ashram bana kar dhanurvidya kaa abhyaas kar rahaa tha
 The dog of the princes wandered and reached Eklavya's ashram
 eklavya ko dekh kar vah bhunkane laga
 The barking of the dog was hindering Eklavya's practice, so he stopped the dog's mouth with his arrows
 eklavya ne is kaushal se baan chalaaye the ki kute ko kisi prakaar kii chot nahin lagi
 On returning the dog, the Kauravas, the Pandavas and Dronacharya themselves were stunned to see this archer and reached Ekalavya, searching for the arrowhead
 unhen yah jaanakar or bhi aashcharya hua ki dronacharya ko maanas guru maanakar eklavya ne swayan hi abhyaas se yah vidya praapt kii he
 According to the legend, Eklavya cut off his thumb in the form of Gurudakshina and gave it to Dronacharya
 iskaa ek sankethik arth yah bhi ho saktaa he ki eklavya ko atimedhaavi jaanakar dronacharya ne use bina anguthe ke dhanush chalaane kii vishesh vidya kaa daan kiya ho
 It is said that after the thumb was cut, Ekalavya started using the index finger and middle finger to shoot the arrow
