 Tariff is the tax levied on tariffs, imports or exports

 For political reasons, tariffs are generally levied on imported goods, although tariffs can also be levied on exported goods
 aajkal kii tulana main, ateet main, tarriff se sarkari rajasav kaa ek bahut bada hissaa aata tha
 When a ship full of cargo reaches a border or port, customs officials inspect the materials and those materials are subjected to a kind of tax according to the tariff formula

 Traders trying to avoid tariffs are known as smugglers
 tarriff ke vibhinn prakaar hai: They also face the problem of unfair transfer pricing where a company declares the value of goods traded which is different from the market price which is intended to cut the total remaining taxes

 The Customs Union has a common external tariff and, according to the agreed formula, the participating countries share the revenue derived from the tariffs levied on goods entering this customs union
 agar kisi desh ke pramukh udyog videshi pratispardhaa main haar jate hai to kaam or kar rajasav kii haani se us desh kii arthvyavastha gambhir rup se vikrut ho sakati he or garibi bad sakati he
 If a country's standard of living or industrial regulations are high enough, domestic industries can survive unprotected trade with small countries without compromising them; The agreement includes a global race below
 sangrakshnatmak teriffon kaa istemaal aitihaasik drushti se is sambhaavna ke khilaaf ek upaay ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 However, there are also disadvantages from protective tariffs

 They can also react in reverse if the countries doing the trade with the tariffs impose tariffs on their own resulting in a trade war and, according to free trade theorists, both sides suffer losses

 In the following graph we look at the impact of import tariffs on the domestic economy

 In this case, the consumer's surplus will be equal to the area within the points A, b and K, while the producer's surplus is shown as the area A, b and L

 If instead, we take the opposite extreme position and assume that all consumers belong to the producer group and also assume that their only purchasing power is related to the salary that is received as production and the cost of the product His salary is full, so the graph looks completely different
 teriffon ke bina, keval vishwa keemat par utpaada kaa nirmaan karne main samarth utpaadakon yaa nirmaataaon / upabhoktaaon ke paas hi utana paisa hoga ki use us keemat par kharid sake
 Consumers still able to purchase small FGL triangles will be matched with a similar small mirror image triangle
 With the tariff, a large CDL triangle and its mirror will survive
 is baat par bhi dhyaan den ki teriffon ke saath yaa teriffon ke bina, gharelu ke upar aaayaatit maal kharidne kaa koi protsaahan nahin miltaa he,kyonki prayek kii keemat ek samaan he
 Imported goods will be purchased only by altering the purchasing power available through loans, by selling assets, or through new salaries from new types of domestic production
 Or, obviously, if it costs only a fraction of wages or salaries
 asli duniya main, chunki adhik aaayaatit maal gharelu maal kii jagah lete hai, isliye ve uplabdh gharelu vetan ke ek bahut bade ansh kaa upbhog karte hai, jisase graph model ke is drushtikon kii disha main badhata he
 If new methods of production are not found in time, the country will go bankrupt and debt will not be able to be repaid due to internal political pressure, too much tariff, or worse
 teriffon kii sthapana is prakriya ko dhimaa kar detii he, jisase nae tarah ke utpaadan ko viksit hone ke liye adhik samay mil jaataa he, lekin yah un udyogon ko bhi majboot bana detaa he jo shaayad kabhi pratispardhi keemat ko phir se na paa sake
 The tariff is used as a political tool to establish an independent nation; For example, the United States Tariff Act of 1789, ie the Tariff Act 1789, which was specifically signed on July 4, was called by the newspapers as the "second Declaration of Independence" meaning the 'second Declaration of Independence' because its motive It was to become an economic instrument for the attainment of the political goal of the United States, universal and independent
 aadhunik samay main, teriffon kaa raajnneetik prabhaav ek sakaaratmak or nakaaratmak arth main dekha jaataa he
 The 2002 United States Steel Tariff, ie the 2002 United States Steel Tariff, imposed a 30% tariff on various types of imported steel products for a period of three years
 American steel producers supported the tariffs, but the Cato Institute criticized the move

 Most of them have been fragmented or aces are two people who believe in them, but the main conflict is in the 'first century BC opinion and' fourth century AD opinion '

 vicramorvasheey ke nayak pururava ke naam kaa vikram main parivartan se is tark ko bal miltaa he ki kalidas ujjayani ke raja vikramaditya ke rajdrabari kavi the

 It is said that Vidyottama vowed that whoever defeated him in debate would marry him
 jab vidyottama ne shastrarth main sabhi vidwaanon ko haraa diya to apmaan se dukhi kuch vidwaanon ne kalidas se uskaa shastrarth karaayaa
 Vidyottama used to ask esoteric questions in the silent vocabulary, which Kalidas used to answer with his intelligence only by silent gestures
 vidyottama ko lagata tha ki kalidas gudh prashn kaa gudh jawaab de rahe hai
 For example, Vidyottama showed an open hand as a question, and Kalidas felt that it was threatening to slap him
 uske jawaab main kalidas ne ghunsa dikhaaya to vidyottama ko laga ki vah kah rahaa he ki paanchon indriyaan bhale hi alag hon, sabhi ek man ke dwaara sanchalit hai

 Malavikagnimitram is the first creation of Kalidasa, with the story of King Agnimitra

 After much apology, the sage softened the curse a bit, saying that everything would be missed as soon as the king's ring showed him
 lekin rajdhani jate hue raste main vah anguthi kho jaati he
 The situation became more serious when Shakuntala came to know that she was pregnant
 shakuntla lakh gidgidai lekin raja ne use pahchaanane se inkaar kar diya
 When a fisherman showed the ring, the king remembered everything and the king adopted Shakuntala
 shakuntla shringaar ras se bhare sundar kaavyon kaa ek anupam naatak he
 It is said that Kavishtu dramas Ramya Tatra Ramya Shakuntala vicramorvasium ek rahasyon bharaa naatak he

 naatakkaar or kavi ke alaava kalidas jyotish ke bhi visheshgy maane jate hai
 Answer: Kalidas is credited for the creation of an astrological book called Kalamritam

 kalidas ko kavikulguru, kanishtikadhishthit or kavitaakaminivilas jaisi prashanshatmak oopaadhiyaan pradaan kii gayi hai jo unke kavyagat vishistataaon se abhibhoot hokar hi di gayi hai
 The specifics of Kalidasa's poetry can be described as follows: kalidas vaidarbhi reeti ke kavi hai or unhone prasad gun se purna lalit shabdayojna kaa prayog kiya he
 Prasad is a symptom of quality - "the quality that pervades the mind in the same way as fire ignites in dry fuel wood" and this is the specialty of Kalidasa's language
 kalidas kii bhashaa madhur naad sundari se yukt he or samaason kaa alpaprayog, padon kaa samuchit sthaan par nivesh, shabdalankaron kaa swaabhaavik prayog ityadi gunon ke kaaran usamen pravaah or pranjalata vidyaman he

 The key feature of Kalidasa's poetry is that he draws the entire picture by expressing it, despite not saying everything in the making of the paintings
 jaise: And Vadini Devarshau Parshu Pituradhomukhi
 lila camel patrani ganyamas parvati

 Disgraced by Vidyottam, two scholars got her married to this Kalidas
 jab use thage jane kaa ahsaas hota he, to wo kalidas ko thukraa detii he
 At the same time, Vidyottama also said that she would accept him if he returned after earning lore and fame
 jab kalidas vidya or prasiddhi arjeet kar laute to sahi rasta dikhaane ke liye kalidas ne unhen patni na maanakar guru maan liya
