 Even though the Adivasis of Indian Sociology may not be formalized, they have enriched this discipline in independent India with their theoretical contributions, unique understanding of caste and the method of participatory observation that they have given to the top sociologists of the country
 Enough to include
 samajashaastra main unhen samskruthikaran, prabhutvshaalee jati or vot bank jaisi moulik prasthaapanaaon ke liye janaa jaataa he
 Srinivas was also the creator of the institutions
 baroda or dilli vishvavidhyalay main samajashaastra ke vibhaagon kii sthapana kaa shrey unheen ko jaataa he
 His contribution to the development of Indian sociology will also be considered as classical in terms of establishing and guiding high-level institutions of research and study
 gramin samudaay or jati kii sanrachana ke vishisht adhyayan ke alaava em
en
 shrinivas ne vigyaan ke saamaajik prabhaav, gandhi ke dharmik chintan, maanavshaastra ke itihaas se lekar gender jaise vishyon par bhi vicharottejak kaam kiya he
 Srinivas's work is considered to be a rare confluence of objective supervision, fineness of analysis and theoretical depth
 unka lekhan antar-vishyaktaa ko ek khaas tarah kaa jamini sandarbh pradaan karata he
 Srinivas's sociological vision explores the external structure of events and fathoms the structures and historical forces that compose them
 saamudayik jivan ke baarik byoron or antardrushtiyon ko saral bhashaa main prastut karne kii unki kshamta unhen samakaleen samajashastriyon se ek alag vyaktitv pradaan karti he
 In this sense, they transcend the thematic vocabulary and choose the simple and popular language
 ise unki vidvatta kaa janawaad hi kaha jayega ki unki saidhantik avadharanaayen apane kutarthon main uljhane ke bajaay vishay ko samajhane main zyaada madad karti hai
 Srinivas created a new land for Indian sociology at the level of ideology
 ullekhneey he ki jis daur main shrinivas bhartiya samaaj ke adhyayan kii taiyaari kar rahe the us samay samaaj-vigyaanon par america or british academik prasthapanaayen haaavee thi
 The prevailing approach in American universities emphasized Sanskritic traditions to understand the society of the Indian subcontinent
 iske asar main bhartiya samajashastri samakaleen yatharth ke adhyayan ke liye sanskrit ke sroton or bharat- vidya / indolji ko zyaada pramanik maanate the
 Srinivas was the first sociologist to challenge this dominant position
 unhone apane lekhan se sabit kiya ki samajashaastra main samaaj ke vaastavik kaaryakalapon or gatividhiyon kaa adhyayan shastreey sandarbhon par nirbhar rahane se zyaada shreyaskar he
 The concepts of dominant caste and Sanskritisation presented by Srinivas have been widely used by historians of streams like subaltern of history-writing besides political scientists
 is arth main unke krititv ko ek bauddhik parampara kii shrenee main rakhaa ja saktaa he jo naye-puraane vidwaanon ke liye ek zaruri sandarbh kii haisiyat hasil kar chukaa he
 Incidentally, the concept of dominant caste reflects dominance in a particular village or region of a caste due to factors such as number force, land ownership, education and job, so Sanskritisation is the culture of upper castes especially Brahmin class by lower castes
 Indicates the tendency to adopt customs, language and costumes etc
 haalaanki unki teesri avadharana vot bank, samaaj-vigyaanon main sthai jagah nahin bana paayi parantu raajnneeti ke dainik vimarsh or media jagat main is pad kaa dhadlle se istemaal kiya jaataa he
 In studying the political and social structure of independent India, all these three concepts and related discourse have acquired immediate significance
 prabhutvshaalee jati or samskruthikaran kii avadharanaayen bharat kii saamaajik vyavastha or uske santhnik dhaanche ke nirnaayak tattvon ko samajhane main madad karti hai
 Although the concept of Sanskritisation is no longer considered as important due to the decreasing legitimacy of Brahminical ideals, the fact remains that Sanskritisation was a fairly notable trend for a long period of the twentieth century and even after independence
 dalit andolan or mandal ayog ke baad ubhari raajnneeti main samskruthikaran kii pravriti ksheen hoti gayi he lekin prabhutvshaalee jati kii avadharana ko bharat ke gramin samaaj main chalane vaali raajnneetik prakriyaaon kaa vishleshan karne main aaj bhi ek jaruri aujaar kii tarah dekha jaataa he
 Many contemporary sociologists have been urging to assess Srinivas's work in the larger context of nationalist sociology
 unka kahana he ki swatantra bharat kaa shahari abhijan aupniveshik shashan ke aadhunikeekaran kii pariyojna ko jari rakhana chahta tha
 Therefore, the same colonial arrays of thought and thought were active in the work of nationalist sociologists on the basis of which the British power had been legitimizing its rule
 in vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki jati or samudaay par kendrit shrinivas jaise samajashastriyon kaa krititv ek akhil bhartiya sanskritvaadi hindu dharm kii samaj ko peethika pradaan karata he
 But Srinivas's vision is a hasty plea to be overtly or indirectly guided by the foundations of British or American anthropology, which, despite the lack of evidence, dares to prepare charge sheets
 yah daleel shrinivas ke krititv kii us pravriti ko lakshith karne main chook karti he jisamen shrinivas samudaay kaa adhyayan karte hue samudaay or apane sambandhon ke dwait par bhi vichaar karte hai
 Srinivas considers the basic foundations of sociology and anthropology in a similar way
 gauratlab he ki shrinivas sahabhaagi adhyeta ke taur par khud ko ek aise adhyeta ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai jisaki iyatta apane vishay yani logon se alag nahin he
 Srinivas did not classify the people or community he studied
 is sambandh main kai british maanavshastri yah maanate rahe hai apane samaaj kaa adhyayan karne vaale maanavshastri ko alag tarah kii mushkilon kaa saamana karnaa padataa he
 According to him, the anthropologist of the developed country always wants to imprison an indigenous anthropologist in a particular mold by pointing to his inferior position
 shrinivas ne is masale par deshaj maanavshastri kii sthiti ko spasht karte hue likhaa tha ki jab koi bhartiya maanavshastri bharat kii kisi jati yaa anya samooh kaa adhyayan karata he to vah jati yaa samooh uske liye anya bhi hota he lekin saath hi is baat ko darkinar nahin karnaa chahie ki us jati yaa samooh ke katipay saanskrithik rup, vishwaas or mulya ukt adhyeta se bhi mail khate hai
 That is, in such a situation the Indian anthropologist actually studies the self in one way or the other
 is myne main vah jati yaa samooh uske liye nitant aparichit yaa anya nahin rah jaataa kyonki donon ek hi samskruti se jude hote hai
 Srinivas considers this situation as unusually complex, multilayered and duplex
 dhyaan se dekhen to shrinivas apane vishay ke saath antar or samanta ke jin binduon baat karte hai unhen dekhte hue un par rashtravaadi samajashastri hone kaa aarope damdaar nahin lagata
 In fact, Srinivas stresses that this multiplicity of self and others in study is far better than the anthropologist's singularity of being a member or an outsider of his community
 yah gauratlab he ki apane shodh adhyayan ke liye shrinivas ne jis rampura gaanv ko chunaa tha uski jati vyavastha ke adhyayan main ve chicago skool ke kai prekshanon kaa upyog karte hai
 Srinivas proving the pre-british concept of varna as a bookish point of view, saying that this vision dwarfs the dynamic aspects of caste
 haalaanki shrinivas kaa jati-adhyayan ek gaanv kii sthaneey sanrachana par kendrit tha lekin vah is parighatna kii akhil bhartiya vyapti ko lekar bhi sachet the
 In one of his articles, he points to the fact that caste is undoubtedly an all-india structure, as groups can be seen everywhere in the country that form a distinct group based on paternal and marital relationships
 shrinivas is sambandh main in samoohon ke parmparik rojgaar kaa hawala bhi dete hai
 He also says that the existence of castes serving Brahmins, untouchables, farmers, artisans, merchants and others can be seen everywhere in the country
 jati ke is adhyayan main shrinivas kshetreey bhinnataaon or pashchimi shiksha, prashasnic naukari, shahar se milane vaali aay jaise karkon kaa bhi ullekh karte hai jinka jati kii sanrachana par vyapak asar padaa he
 In the long term, Srinivas, as a sociologist, has also freed the Indian village and caste structure from the theoretical dominance of colonial perceptions

 When Srinivas talks about the concept of rural community and the economic-cultural interdependence of villages, he also talks about All India Civilization in a latent manner
 kuch vidwaanon kaa maananaa he ki shrinivas ne jati ke adhyayan main brahmanvaadi yaa ucch jati kaa drushtikon apanaaya he
 But looking at this argument from the right angle, it seems to have originated from colonial sociology
 shrinivas kii tark-yojana vastav main pashchimi samajashastriyon kii bharat ke gramin samudaayon ke sambandh main pratipaadit sthool or alp-chintit dharanaon ko ujagar karti he
 In a nutshell, Srinivas's work provides many basic arguments in the Western discourse of philosophical propositions, perceptions of self, community and nation

 Vali or Bali is a character in the Ramayana
 vah sugriv kaa bada bhai tha
 He was the king of Kishkindha and is said to be the son of Indra
 vishnu ke avatar ram ne uskaa vadh kiya
 Although Vali has been described from chapters 5 to 26 out of the 67 chapters of the book Kishkindhandak in the Ramayana, Vali has had a major role in the Ramayana, especially his slaughter
 wali ke janm ko lekar ek rochak prasang maujuud he
 It is said that Vali was the son of Indra and Arun
 indra devataaon ke raja the or arun suryadev ke sarathi
 It is believed that Surya comes in the morning in the chariot of seven white horses, which is run by Arun
 ek baar kii baat he ki kisi rishi ne surya ko yah shaap de diya ki vah prithvi ke upar prakaashmaan nahin honge
 Because the sun stopped the chariot after this, so Arun had no work
 arun kii pehle se hi swarg lok main jaakar apsaraon kaa divya nrity dekhne kii ichha rahi thi
 Taking advantage of this opportunity, she dressed as a young lady and reached heaven to watch the dance of the Apsaras
 indra, jo ki is nrity kaa anand le rahe the, ne arun rupi yuvati ko dekha or usapar mohit ho gayi
 The two met and Arun eventually gave birth to Vali
 wali kaa paalan-poshan gautam rishi kii patni ahilya ne kiya
 Monkey king wali kaa vivaah vanar vaidyaraj sushen kii putree tara ke saath sampann hua tha
 According to a legend, during the Samudra Manthan, one of the fourteen monies were nymphs
 unheen apsaraon main se ek tara thi
 Both Vali and Sushen were helping the deities in the manthan
 jab unhone tara ko dekha to donon main use patni banane kii hode lagi
 Vali stood on the right side of Tara and Sushen on his left
 tab vishnu ne faisalaa sunaaya ki vivaah ke samay kanya ke dahini taraf uskaa hone vaala pati tathaa baayin taraf kanyadan karne vaala pita hota he
 Hence Vali Tara's husband and Sushen were declared her father
 aisa kaha jaataa he ki wali ko uske pita indra se ek swarna haar praapt hua jisko brahma ne mantrayukt karke yah vardaan diya tha ki isko pahanakar vah jab bhi ranbhumi main apane dushman kaa saamana karegaa to uske dushman kii aadhi shakti ksheen ho jaayegi or wali ko praapt ho jaayegi
 For this reason Vali was almost invincible
 ramayana main aisa prasang aata he ki ek baar jab wali sandhyavandan ke liye ja rahaa tha to akaash se naarad muni ja rahe the
 When Vali greeted him, Narada told that he was going to Lanka where Lankapati Ravana organized a feast to commemorate the defeat of Devraj Indra
 chanchal swabhaav ke naarad – jinhen sarvagyaan he – ne wali se chutki lene kii koshish kii or kaha ki ab to puure brahmand main keval ravan kaa hi aadhipaty he or saare praani, yahan tak ki devatagan bhi use hi sheesh navate hai
 Vali said that Ravana has used his boon and his army to suppress those who are weak but i am not among them and you should make this point clear to Ravana
 sarvagyani naarad ne yahi baat ravan ko ja kar bataai jise sunakar ravan krodhit ho gaya
 He gave orders to prepare his army
 naarad ne usase bhi chutki lete huye kaha ki ek vanar ke liye yadi aap puri sena lekar jaayenge to aapke sammaan ke liye yah uchit nahin hoga
 Ravana immediately agreed and sat in his Pushpak plane and reached near Vali
 wali us samay sandhyavandan kar rahaa tha
 Seeing the golden radiance of Vali, Ravana got nervous and tried to attack Vali from behind
 wali apni puja archana main tallin tha lekin phir bhi usne use apni punch se pakadakar or uskaa sir apane bagal main dabaakar puure vishwa main ghumaya
 He did this so that the creatures of the whole world see Ravana in this helpless state and his fear is removed from his mind
 iske pashchaat ravan ne apni paraajay sweekaar kii or wali kii ore maitri kaa haath badhaayaa jise wali ne sweekaar kar liya
 The demon named Maya had two sons - Mayavi and Dundubhi
 dundubhi mahish rupi asur tha
 The great Dundubhi was so enthralled by the mountain that he challenged Sagar Raj for a duel war
 haalaanki sagar raaj uskaa dambh vahiin khatm kar sakate the lekin unhone kaha ki aise vir se vah dwandv karne main asamarth hai tathaa dundubhi ko giriyon ke raja himavan ke paas jane ko kaha
 When Dundubhi went to Himwan, Himwan also refused to fight with him and suggested to challenge Indra's son Vali who was the king of Kishkindha
 dundubhi tab kiskindha ke dwaar main gaya or wali ko dwandv ke liye lalakaara
 Madamasta Wali first tried to convince Dumbubhi, but when he did not agree, Vali agreed to the duel and beat Dundubhi very easily and killed her
 iske pashchaat wali ne dundubhi ke nirjeev sharir ko uchhaalkar ek hi jatke main ek yojan dur phenk diya
 Droplets of blood dripping from the body fell into the hermitage of Maharishi Matang, which was located in Rishimuk mountain
 krodhit matang ne wali ko shaap de daalaa ki yadi wali kabhi bhi unke ashram ke ek yojan ke daayre main aayaa to vah mrityu ko praapt hoga
 It is also mentioned in the Kishkindha Kanda of Ramayana that the daily used to go to the west coast and north to south coasts from the east coast to offer water to the sun
 raste main ai pahaado kii chotiyon ko vah aise upar phenkata tha or punah pakad letaa tha maano vah koi gend hon
 Even after this, when he returned after sun worshiping, he did not get tired
 wali ke bare main yah kaha jaataa he ki yadi koi use dwandv ke liye lalakaare to vah turant taiyaar ho jaataa tha
 Dundubhi's elder brother Mayavi had a great old enmity with a woman
 mayavi ek raat kiskindha aayaa or wali ko dwandv ke liye lalakaara
 Despite the refusal of women and well-wishers, Vali ran after that demon
 saath main sugriv bhi uske saath tha
 Rushing into the elusive land, he entered a tomb
 wali bhi uske peeche-peeche gaya
 Before leaving, he ordered Sugriva to guard Sugriva by standing at the mouth of the tomb until he came back after killing the elusive
 ek varsh se adhik interval ke pashchaat kandara ke muhane se rakt bahata hua baahar aayaa
 Sugriva listened to the asura of the demon, but not the brother
 yah samajhakar ki uskaa agraj ran main maaraa gaya, sugriv ne us kandara ke munh ko ek shila se band kar diya or waapas kiskindha aa gaya jahaan usne yah samachar sabko sunaaya
 The ministers, after consulting him, crowned Sugriva
 kuch samay pashchaat wali prakat hua or apane anuj ko raja dekh bahut kupit hua
 Sugriva tried his best to convince him, but Vali did not listen to him and grabbed Sugriva's kingdom and wife Ruma and expelled him
 dar ke kaaran sugriv ne rishyamook parvat main sharan lee jahaan shaap ke kaaran wali nahin ja saktaa tha
 This is where Sugriva met Rama due to Hanuman
 ram ke yah aashwaasan dene par ki ram swayan wali kaa vadh karenge, sugriv ne wali ko lalakaara
 Vali came out hearing the challenge
 donon main ghamaasan yuddh hua, parantu kyonki dono bhaaiyon kii mukh tathaa deh rachana samaan thi, isliye ram ne asamanjas ke kaaran apana baan nahin chalaaya
 Eventually Vali defeated Sugriva and drove him away
 sugriv niraash hokar phir ram ke paas aa gaya
 Rama this time asked Lakshmana to put a garland around Sugriva's neck so that he would not make any mistake in recognizing Sugriva during the duel and asked Sugriva to challenge Vali again
 hataash sugriv phir se kiskindha ke dwaar kii ore wali ko lalkaarane ke liye chal padaa
 When Vali again heard Sugriva's shout, he could not bear the brunt of his anger
 tara ko shaayad is baat kaa bodh ho gaya tha ki sugriv ko ram kaa sangrakshan hasil he kyonki akele to sugriv wali ko dobaaraa lalkaarane kii himmat kadaapi nahin karata
 So Tara tried to warn the Vali due to fear of something untoward
 usne yahan tak kaha ki sugriv ko kiskindha kaa yuvaraj ghoshit kar wali uske saath sandhi kar le
 But Vali reprimanded her with the suspicion that Tara was taking an unfair side of Sugriva
 kintu usne tara ko yah aashwaasan diya ki vah sugriv kaa vadh nahin karegaa or sirf use acha sabak sikhaayegaa
 The duel started again between the two brothers, but this time Rama did not make any mistake in recognizing the two brothers and he fired an arrow with a tree
 baan ne wali ke hriday ko bedh daalaa or vah dharashaayi hokar zamin par gir gaya
 The mortal who fell on earth posed many questions to Rama, whose essence is as follows: - ramayana main valmiki ne in prashnon ke jawaab dene kii yathasambhav cheshtaa kii he, parantu koi thos jawaab ke abhaav main ramayana par tippanee karne waalon ne apane-apane andaaz main is prakaran ko uchit sabit karne kii koshish kii he
 According to Kritivasi Ramayana, the Bengali version of the Ramayana, Tara curses Rama that in the next life he will be killed in the same way at the hands of Rama Vali, because perhaps the author of this Ramayana found the whole episode to be irrational and thus resolved the episode
 
 mahanatak tathaa anand ramayana main aisa ullekh he ki agle janm main wali shikari ke rup main akhet ke bhram main krishna — jo ki vishnu ke agle avatar hai — kii hatya kar detaa he

 They are just different means of reaching God
 maanviya mulyon ke poshak sant ramakrishna paramhans kaa janm 18 farvari 1836 ko bengal praant sthit kamarpukur gram main hua tha
 His childhood name was Gadadhar
 pitaaji ke naam khudiram or mataji ke naam chandramanidevi tha
 According to his devotees, Ramakrishna's parents had experienced supernatural events and scenes even before his birth
 gaya main unke pita khudiram ne ek swapn dekha tha jisamen unhone dekha kii bhagwaan gadadhar ne unhen kaha kii ve unke putr ke rup main janm lenge
 His mother Chandramani Devi also had such an experience
 He saw Roshni entering her womb in the Shiva temple

 Ramakrishna was given the responsibility of decorating the Goddess statue
 1856 main ramkumar ke mrityu ke pashchaat ramakrishna ko kaali mandir main purohit ke taur par niyukt kiya gaya
 After Ramkumar's death, Sri Ramakrishna became more meditative
 ve kaali mata ke murti ko apni mata or bramhand kii mata ke rup main dekhne lage
 It is said that Shri Ramakrishna had the vision of Kali Mata as the mother of the universe
 ramakrishna isaki varnana karte hue kehete hai " ghar ,dwaar ,mandir or sab kuch adrishy ho gaya, jaise kahin kuch bhi nahin tha! or maine ek anant tir viheen alok kaa sagar dekha, yah chetana kaa sagar tha

 unka yah maananaa tha ki shaadi hone par gadadhar kaa maansik santulan thik ho jaayegaa, shaadi ke baad aaye zimmedaariyon ke kaaran unka dhyaan aadhyatmik sadhana se hat jayega
 Ramakrishna himself told him that he could find Ramchandra Mukherjee's house in Kanya Jayarambati for him
 1859 main 5 varsh kii shaaradamani mukhopadhyaay or 23 varsh ke ramakrishna kaa vivaah sampann hua

 His new name was Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa after he retired
 iske baad unhone islam or chrishchiyan dharm kii bhi sadhana kii
 As time went on, news of his rigorous spiritual practices and siddhis began to spread rapidly and the temple garden of Dakshineswar soon became a favorite shelter for devotees and wandering ascetics

 Vivekananda, the beloved disciple of Ramakrishna, wanted to do penance for some time in a solitary place in the Himalayas

 His ideas had a tremendous impact on the intellectuals of Calcutta; However, his teachings were not about modernity and the independence of the nation

 According to Ramakrishna, humans are the biggest goal of life

 Ramakrishna used to see the world as Maya

 The use of their legislative powers by government officials for illegal private profit is called political corruption
 kintu saamanytah sarkari shaktiyon kaa durupyog rajnatik bhrashtachar main nahin gina jaataa
 There can be many varieties and degrees of corruption, but political and administrative corruption is believed to affect society and the system the most
 agar use sanyamit na kiya jaae to bhrashtachar maujuuda or aane vaali pidiyon ke maanas kaa ang ban saktaa he
 It is believed that corruption is benefiting everyone from top to bottom, less to some and more to some
 raajnneetik or prashasnic bhrashtachar ek-duusare se alag na ho kar paraspar gathjod se panpate hai
 According to the 2004 Global Corruption Report, Indonesia's President Suharto, Philippines President Marcos, Zaire President Mobuto Seku, Nigeria's President Sani Abaka, Sarabia's President Milosevich, Haiti's President Duvelier and Peru's President Fujimori made hundreds to billions of dollars Corruption of money
 ye bhrasht netaa bina naukarshahi kii madad ke sarkari dhan kii yah lut nahin kar sakate the
 The special thing is that private sector and corporate capital also have a role in this corruption
 bazaar kii prakriyaaon or sheersh raajnneetik- prashasnic mukaamon par liye gayi nirnyon ke bich saathganth ke bina yah bhrashtachar itnaa bada rup nahin le saktaa
 Even after independence, this phenomenon of political and administrative corruption has grown rapidly in India
 ek taraf shaq kiya jaataa he ki bade-bade rajanetaaon kaa avaidh dhan swiss bainkon ke kufia kaaton main jamaa he or duusari taraf teesri shrenee ke clerkon se lekar iees afasaron ke gharon par padane vaale chhaapon se karodon-karodon kii sampatti baraamad hui he
 In order to understand political and administrative corruption properly, scholars have divided it into two categories
 sarkari pad par rahete hue uskaa durupyog karne ke zariye kiya gaya bhrashtachar or raajnneetik yaa prashasnic haisiyat ko banaaye rakhane ke liye kiya jane vaala bhrashtachar
 In the first category, the commission received in exchange for contracts and licenses given to the private sector, the commission in the sale and sale of arms, the money collected by fraudulent and other economic offenses, the help of tax evasion and the incentive
 , Using political influence, raising money, using government influence to benefit a company and in return for the money and profit Activities such as illegal money recovered by senior bureaucrats and leaders in lieu of appointments fall into the first category
 duusari shrenee main chunaav ladane ke liye party-fand ke naam par ugaahi jane vaali rakamen, votaron ko kareedne kii karrwai, bahumat praapt karne ke liye vidhayakon or saansadon ko kareedne main karch kiya jane vaala dhan, sansad-adaalaton, sarkari sansthaao, nagar samaaj kii sansthaaon or media se apane paksh main faisale lene yaa unka samarthan praapt karne ke liye karch kiye jane vaale sansaadhan or sarkari sansadhano ke aabantan main kiya jane vaala pakshpaat aata he
 In order to understand political-administrative corruption, it is necessary to make a differentiation apart from these two categories
 yah he sheersh padon par hone vaala bada bhrashtachar or nichle mukaamon par hone vaala chota-motaa bhrashtachar
 Susan Rose Ackerman in her work Corruption and Government: Causes, Consequences and Reform, has termed corruption as 'kleptocracy'
 kisi bhi tantra ke sheersh par baitha koi bada rajaneta yaa koi bada naukarshah ek nijee ijaaredaar poonjipati kii tarah aacharan kar saktaa he
 Although Ackerman has ignored the example of India, the officers at the head of public sector institutions in India have been labeled as 'government Mughals'
 nyaayadhishon dwaara kiye jane vaale nyaayik bhrashtachar kii parighatna bharat main abhi nayi he lekin uskaa asar dikhaai dene laga he
 The top game of the leaders and officials was also behind the huge corruption in organizing the Commonwealth Games held in Delhi
 tu ji spectrum ke aabantan main hue bhrashtachar ko bhi clayptocraisi ke taaze udhaaharan ke taur par liya ja saktaa he
 Lower level corruption is known as 'speed money' or 'convenience fee'
 thana str ke police adhikari, bikri kar yaa aay kar adhikari, seemaa or utpaada-shulk adhikari or vibhinn kism ke inspactor is tarah ke bhrashtachar se labhanvit hote hai
 Similarly, in the allocation of contracts awarded at the district level, it is a common practice to distribute the amount of commission in the entire district administration
 yahan in donon tarah ke bhrashtacharon ke moolyankan sambandhi vivaad kaa zikr karnaa zaruri he
 There is often a debate in public life that kleptocracy is a much bigger problem, or a convenience fee? Is society affected more by corruption at the top, or by relatively small corruption at the bottom? There is a debate behind this debate which is associated with kleptocracy
 sattar or assi ke dashakon main dekha yah gaya tha ki kai baar sheersh par baithe hue clayptocratic shaasha yaa afasar nichle str par hone vaale bhrashtachar ko naapsand karte hai
 They felt that this untimely corruption brings the system into disrepute and their own ability to take illegal benefits is reduced
 is drushtikon main nichle str kaa bhrashtachar prashasnic aakshamata kaa dyotak tha
 It is true that corruption of small scale makes bribery decentralized throughout the society
 ecreman ne bhi apni rachana main is pahalu kii shinaakht kii he
 An example of its social impact in India can be seen as the high dowry-rates of the males in positions of profit in the marriage market
 lekin duusari taraf bhartiya udhaaharan hi yah bataata he ki bhrashtachar kaa yah rup na keval sheersh padon par hone vaali kamishankhori, dallali or ugaahi se judata he, balki donon ek-duusare ko pani dete hai
 For the last twenty years, the technology of bureaucratic planned extortion by the ruling Nizam to contest the next elections at the level of state governments in Indian democracy has almost been established
 is prakriya ne clayptocraisi or suvidha shulk ke bich kaa fark kaafii had tak kam kar diya he
 In a parliamentary democracy like India, the process of contesting and winning in it remains a major source of illicit money use and consequently corruption
 yah samasya arthvyavastha par sarkari niyantran ke dinon main bhi thi, lekin bazaronmukh vyavastha ke jamaane main isane pehle se kahin zyaada bheeshan rup grahan kar liya he
 On one hand, the number and frequency of elections are increasing, on the other hand politicians need money to contest elections and run parties
 naukarshahi kaa istemaal karke dhan ugaahne ke saath-saath raajnneetik dal nijee sroton se bade paimaane par kufia anudaan praapt karte hai

 On one hand, the investment of money in the election process by organized crime and on the other hand, the mafia chiefs themselves try to win elections by becoming candidates of the parties

 The other side of this discussion assumes that if voters find out the corruption of leaders, they will punish them in the next election and elect honest representatives
 lekin, aisa hameshaa nahin hota
 Often voters have the option to choose between the corrupt corrupt ruling party on the one hand and the leader of a suspicious character sitting in the opposition on the other side

 gandhiji ne 23 oktober 1937 ko 'nayi talim' kii yojana banaayi jise rashtravyapee vyaavhaarik rup diya janaa tha
 Their educational ideas did not match the views of the academicians, so their ideas were initially opposed
 gandhiji ne kaha tha ki nayi talim kaa vichaar bharat ke liye unka antim evam sarvshereshth yogadan he
 Gandhiji's long brainstorming of ideas through active experiments for the exploration of truth and creation of the nation resulted in the emergence of a new training philosophy and process which not only gave India but a whole new human society

 Gandhiji presided over the 'all India Educational Conference' held in Wardha from 22–23 October 1937
 uske udghaatan bhaashan main gandhiji ne apane shikshadarshan ke mahatvapurn pahaluon par prakaash daalaa
 After that, many aspects of his 'nai Talim' scheme were openly discussed

 On the basis of these proposals, a national educational scheme was prepared which became famous as 'nai Talim', 'basic Education' or 'wardha Scheme' across the country

 Gandhiji considered basic education a means of social change

 He considered a major basis of social revolution by rebuilding the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of the individual
 ve vyakti ke shaareerik, maansik tathaa aadhyatmik pakshon ke punarnirmaan dwaara saamaajik kranti laana chaahate the
 He considered self-confidence and self-reliance as the basis of complete development of human beings

 That is why he considered it necessary to give free and compulsory education to all the boys and girls of the age group of seven to fourteen

 They were expected to be instrumental in the development of basic education
 kintu unke istife ke parinamswaroop, kuch praanton main prayog bilkul band kar die gaye or anya praanton main prayog ke prati udaseenta dikhaai dene lagi
 Only after independence, basic education was seriously accepted as the national method of education
 buniyadi shiksha nirantar pragati karti rahi he kyonki basic skulon kii sankhya baraabar badhati rahi he
 But there has been a decrease in the growth rate of the number of basic schools compared to ordinary elementary and middle schools
 basic skulon main pravesh kaa jahaan tak sambandh he sthiti santoshjanak nahin rahi he
 The goal was to provide basic education for all boys and girls in the age group of 6 to 14 years in basic education
 kintu pratham do yojanaon main koi mahatvapurn pragati is shiksha main nahin hui
 During this period, the progress of the spread of basic education was not as much as that of the promotion of ordinary elementary education, although the progress of simple elementary education is also not satisfactory
 adhyaaapak shikshan kii sthiti bhi bilkul santoshjanak nahin he
 The 1960 AD report of the First National Seminar on the Education of Elementary Teachers in India and the recent 1963 AD report of the Committee on Plan Projects regarding Teacher Training proves that there are many errors in the teacher training program
 isamen na keval uchit evam yogya karmchaariyon, bhawanon, upkarnon or anya sthool sadhano kii kami rahi he balki aparyaapt paathya vishay or shikshan kii prabhaavaheen vidhi tathaa style kaa bhi dosha rahaa he
 There is no clear definition of basic education by which people generally agree
 buniyadi shiksha ke vaastavik mul tatv evam nishchit lakshya ke sambandh main bahut hi gadabadi dikhaai detii he
 Gandhiji envisaged a certain social order while formulating the principles of basic education
 vah utpaadak kaary ko shiksha kaa centre maanate the kintu vaastavik prayog main utpaadak kaary dwaara shiksha ke siddhant ke bhinn bhinn arth ho gaye hai
 Some academics, who claim to be followers of Gandhiji, insist on the actual production of usable goods in schools
 kuch logon kaa mat he ki iskaa arth khel vidhi dwaara shiksha ke atirikt kuch nahin he
 The question of self-sufficiency in basic education is even more controversial
 gandhi ji aatmanirbharta ko shiksha kaa vaastavik maapdand samajhate the
 By self-sufficiency, he meant that basic schools should be self-sufficient to the extent that teachers' salaries could be paid by selling goods produced by children in schools
 isliye aarambh main buniyadi shiksha ke samarthakon kaa bahut bada varg is baat kii aashaa karne laga ki yadi buniyadi shiksha ke liye samuchit vaataavaran paidaa kiya jaae to iskaa adhik maatra main kharch nikal jayega or avshesh kharch sarkaar de degi jisase basic skool dakshatapurvak chal sakenge
 But from experience this conjecture proved to be wrong
 bharat sarkaar ke shiksha mantralay dwaara niyukt pieres-lakhni samiti ne is samasya kaa adhyayan kiya or bataaya ki 1950-1951 main bihar main, jo buniyadi shiksha kaa pramukh pradesh samajha jaataa tha, koi bhi vidhyalay 41
09 pratishat se adhik swaavlambee nahin tha
 The basic school of Sevagram, which was under the guidance and supervision of Hindustani Talimi Sangh, was self-supporting by 63 percent
 isanan is disha main basic vidyalayon kii suchi main sarvapratham sthaan praapt karne kaa gaurav praapt kiya tha
 In the year 1949-1950, 100 basic schools of Bihar state, including 18 senior basic schools, were able to be self-supporting only 15 percent
 tab se saadhaaran taur se, paristhiti main achchhai kii ore koi parivartan nahin dikhaai detaa he
 The evaluation committee appointed by the Government of India at the end of the first five-year plan for basic education also reached the same conclusion
 bharat sarkaar ne 'buniyadi shiksha kii sankalpana' sheershak pustika main swaavlamban kaa ullekh tak nahin kiya
 Even Vinoba Bhave, the great nutrient of the ideals of Gandhism, now has the idea that the benefit of the sale of the goods produced by children should not be used to reduce the reasonable expenditure on education, but it should be given to the parents by which they should get their To compensate for the loss caused by not being able to benefit from the help of your children at work
 aisa lagata he, sarkaar bhi siddhant rup se yah sweekaar karti he ki bacchon ke utpaadak kaaryan se praapt laabh unheen ke hit main kharch kiya jaae, jaise vidhyalay ke paridhaan yaa madhyanh ke bhojan ke prabandh par
 Therefore, it can be concluded that as per Gandhi's imagination, the cost of basic education cannot be reduced to a large extent by starting productive businesses in basic schools
 isliye buniyadi shiksha ko yadi desh bhar main praarambhik shiksha kii saarvbhaum paddati bananaa ho to iske liye prachur maatra main badhaai gai arthvyavastha aavashyak he
 The question of making basic education universal should be considered at the level of reality
 bharat ne samaajawaadee adarshavaale samaaj kii sthapana kaa sankalp kiya he
 One of the essentials of such a society is that all its members are well-educated so that they can contribute more and more to the common interest and properly benefit from the fruits of their combined efforts
 isliye kam se kam samay ke andar saarvbhaum, ni:shulk or anivaary shikshapradaan kaa prabandh sabase pehle hona chahie
 According to the 45th section of the constitution, by 1960 AD, the free and compulsory education of all children in the age of 14 years should have been arranged by the state
 yah ek vishaal samasya he or iske samaadhaan ke liye maanviya or bhautik donon prakaar ke mahan sadhano kii aavashyaktaa he
 It is estimated that if the country spends only two percent of its national income on elementary education, the necessary resources can be obtained in such a quantity that all the children of 14 years of age can get education facilities from 1980 to 1981
 ab yadi buniyadi shiksha sabhi bacchon ko di jaae to saarvbhaum shiksha ke str tak pahunchne main bahut adhik samay lagegaa
 Basic education is more expensive due to its high quality
 buniyadi shiksha kii rashtriya samiti dwaara niyukt sahaayak samiti kii siforeeshon se spasht he ki ek saadhaaran praarambhik vidhyalay ko basic skool main parivartit karne main kam se kam jitne sadhano kii aavashyaktaa he unhen dhyaan main rakhte hue praarambhik shiksha ke saath saath hi buniyadi shiksha kaa vikaas hona aavashyak prathit hota he
 The need is that a visionary plan should be made according to which the expansion of basic education should be equal so that in the end it will develop into an improved method of elementary education at the national level
 kuch baaten jinke karne kii aavashyaktaa he, neeche prastaavit kii jaati hai : Basic schools working on traditional principles should be made true basic schools, at least fulfilling the mandatory conditions
 jin vidyalayon kaa purna vikaas nahin ho sakaa he unako adhik se adhik sahaayta deni chahie taaki ve adarsh basic skool ban saken or duusare unka anukaran karen
 Continue to expand the expansion of basic education
 saadhaaran vidyalayon ko basic skulon main badalen or nae basic skool kholen
 Most states may increase the number of basic schools by at least 5 percent per year
 basic skulon ke liye udyog chunate samay yah baat dhyaan main rakhni chahie ki udyog shaksha kii drushti se samrudh hon tathaa saamaajik vaataavaran or bacchon kii avasthaa ke anukool hon
 To prevent waste of raw materials, industry related work should not be done in the following categories of basic schools till the children are mature enough that they can use it profitably
 mitti kaa kaam, praarambhik bagwani yaa kuch kam kharchavaale haath ke kaam neeche kii kakshaon main karaae ja sakate hai
 There is a need to make changes in the curriculum of basic education on this basis
 sabhi praarambhik vidyalayon main buniyadi shiksha ke kuch tatv saraltapurvak apanaae ja sakate hai, jaise swasthya sambandhi kriyaayein, saamaajik seva ke kaarykram, saanskrithik kaaryaklap ityadi
 a school that has sufficient land and adequate irrigation facilities can undertake the production of fruits and vegetables
 yah aavashyak he ki jin vidyalayon main ye kriyaayein aarambh kii jaaen, unka bhalee bhanti niyojan kiya jaae or saath hi, unase puraa puraa shaikshik laabh uthaaya jaae
 Answer: The basic school should be considered as a branch of the multipurpose higher secondary school where emphasis should be placed on qualifying in the industry which a student has been pursuing from the basic school

 In order to run the basic educational plan of the basic school, it is necessary that teachers have a high educational background and are proficient in their work
 praarambhik vidyalayon ke liye adhyaaapak taiyaar karanevaali sabhi prashikshan sasthayen basic dhang kii honi chahie
 An ideal training school should be established in every district of each state

 This center should have adequate teachers and equipment and the entire program of basic education should be completed by this
 yah ek prashikshan ke bahugrahi mahavidhyalay kaa abhinn ang ho jisamen kai prashikshan sansthaayen hon jo shiksha ke sabhi staron evam vidhyalay ke kaarykram kii bhinn bhinn shakhaon ke liye adhyaaapak taiyaar karen
 In 1938, the basic plan of basic education was prepared by the Zakir Hussain Committee
 isamen yah sifarish kii gai thi ki prayek praant main shiksha kii ek samiti sthapit honi chahie jiske kaaryon main buniyadi shiksha main khoj or sanghathan kaa kaary bhi sammilit kiya jaae
 The state institution of education established in each state should study and research various problems of basic education
 rashtriya shaikshanik anusandhan or prashikshan parishad ko rashtriya str ke mahatv vaali samasyaon kaa anusandhan karnaa chahie
 The research should make the methodology comprehensible and accessible to the teacher
 buniyadi shiksha sambandhi kuch aisi mukhya samasyaayen hai jinhen sulajhane ke liye sheeghra dhyaan diya janaa aavashyak he, jaise ek hi shikshak dwaara anek kakshaon ke padhaane kii samasya, aisi kakshaon ko padhaane kii samasya, jinamein bacchon kii sankhya bahut adhik ho, bhinn bhinn udyogon kii shaikshik sambhaavnaaon kaa pataa lagane or unki paddati tathaa utpaadan kshamta kaa vikaas karnaa jinke dwaara jaanch kii ja sake ki kahan tak buniyadi shiksha kii pragati uske uddeshyon ke anusaar ho rahi he taaki in vidhiyon or upkarnon se buniyadi shiksha ke adhyak evam prashaasak aavashyaktaanusaar laabh uthaa sake, basic skulon ke liye adhyaaapak taiyaar karanevaali prashikshan sansthaaon kii samasyaon kii ore dhyaan dena taaki prashikshan kaarykram ko prabhaavshaalee banaaya ja sake or chatradhyaapakon ke liye upyukt sahitya kii taiyaari par dhyaan dena ityadi

 As soon as the soldiers conquered one place, they were suddenly ordered to move forward

 yugoslavia ke is dal kaa uddeshy shatru ke un sampann lakshyon par akraman karnaa tha jo durbal the or jahaan akraman hone kii sabase kam apeksha kii jaati thi
 Apart from this, at any stage they did not want to give such an opportunity that the enemies could retaliate against them

 In a period of three years, the enemy attacked seven times to destroy the guerrillas and also resorted to the Air Force, but each time Tito's counterpart survived somehow and the axis reappeared to attack the nation at such a place
 Where his attack could not be expected
 aadhunik vayusena or chhapamaron ke sahyog se kya parinaam nikal sakate hai, yugoslavia iskaa pramaan he
 The attack of the guerrillas on the communication system of the enemy has an important place in the success of the Russians

 After the spread of these parties, there was difficulty in arranging mutual communication among the parties
 is kathinaayee ko dur karne ke liye chhapamaron ne janata ke chote radio seton se kaam liya
 Later in 1942, a direct radio connection of the partisan troops was established with General macarthur's main office in Australia

 Even today the guerrillas move at a rapid pace, cheating and attacking the enemy where they are most vulnerable

 In these types of wars, it has become mandatory to get the help and good wishes of the public

 Consequently, if molecular power is used, the guerrillas will become smaller in size and more conserving

 The regular army will also fight in small squads

 This Indus word became 'hindu', Hindi and then 'hindu' in Irani
 baad main irani dhire-dhire bharat ke adhik bhaagon se parichit hote gaye or is shabd ke arth main vistaar hota gaya tathaa hind shabd puure bharat kaa vaachak ho gaya

 The earliest use of this word for Hindi language is found in Shafruddin Yaj + Di's 'zafarnama'

 'S' was spoken as 'H'
 jaise sanskrit ke 'asur' shabd ko vahaan 'ahur' kaha jaataa tha
 After Afghanistan, the entire region of Hindustan across this Indus river has also been called in ancient Persian literature with the names of 'hind', 'hindush' and any object, language, idea here as 'adjunctive' as 'hindu' 'which means' of Hind'
 yahi 'hindik' shabd arabi se hota hua greek main 'indike', 'indika', latin main 'indiya' tathaa angrezi main 'india' ban gaya
 In Arabic and Persian literature, the term 'zaban-e-hindi' has been used for the languages spoken in India
 bharat aane ke baad arabi-farsi bolne waalon ne 'zabaan-e-hindi', 'hindi jubaan' athwa 'hindi' kaa prayog dilli-agra ke chaaron ore boli jane vaali bhashaa ke arth main kiya
 non-muslim people of India used to name the language form spoken in the region as 'bhakha', not 'hindi'
