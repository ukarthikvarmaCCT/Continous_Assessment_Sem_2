 O! say can you see by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there; O! say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,what is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,as it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,in full glory reflected now shines in the stream:’tis the star-spangled banner, O! long may it waveo’er the land of the free and the home of the brave
 And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, a home and a country, should leave us no more? Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution
no refuge could save the hireling and slave from the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave: And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave, O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave
 O! thus be it ever, when freemen shall standbetween their loved home and the war’s desolation
blest with vict’ry and peace, may the Heav’n rescued landpraise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,and this be our motto: “in God is our trust;”and the star-spangled banner in triumph shall waveo’er the land of the free and the home of the brave! Oh, tell me, you can see in the light of dawn, how proud we were to welcome the last glow at sunset, whose wide strips and bright stars we saw at the top of the ramparts, at the time of the dangerous battle, How bravely did we fly? And the red glow of the rocket, through the bombardment in the air, testifies that our flag was still there; Oh, tell me if the sitar-equipped flag still waved Has it been on the land of free people and the homes of brave people? tat par gahare kohre main chupe hue dhang se,jahaan dushmano kii ahamkaari fuj bhay maun main jhuk gayi he,qu'est-ce que cette brise intermittente, le long du versant,nous dévoile et nous cache ?À présent elle capture l'éclat du premier rayon de soleil,nous le renvoie dans toute sa gloire, maintenant elle brille dans le ventc'est la bannière étoilée ! Oh puisse-t-elle longtemps flottersur la terre de la Liberté et la patrie des braves
 And where is the band that swears while boasting Que les foudres de la guerre et la désolation des combatsne nous laisseraient ni terre ni patrie! Leur sang a purifié la terre qu'ils ont foulée
 Any asylum mercenaries and their slaves Cannot save from the terror of despair and despair of the grave, and the star-studded flag will be waved in triumph over the land of independent people and the homes of valiant people
 Oh ! Qu'il en soit toujours ainsi, que les hommes libres protègentleur patrie chérie des désolations de la guerre !vijay or shanti ke saath dhanya, que la patrie protégée par le cielusa shakti kaa gungan karen jisane hamen ek raashtra banaaya or sangrakshit kiya
 And we must win when our campaign is just, and it is our goal: "we believe in God"
