 bhu-akruti vaigyanik yah samajhane kii koshish karte hai ki bhu-drishy jaise dikhte hai vaisaa dikhne ke peeche kaaran kya he, ve bhu-akritiyon ke itihaas or unki gatiki ko jaanane kaa prayaas karte hai or bhoomi avlokan, bhautik pareekshan or sankhyatmak modelling ke ek sangyojan ke madhyam se bhavishya ke badlaavon kaa purvanumaan karte hai
 Geomorphology is studied in geography, geology, geodesy, engineering geology, archeology and geotechnical engineering and this broad base of interest generates a wide variety of research styles and interests under the subject
 prithvi kii sataha, prakritik or manvodbhav vigyaan sambandhi prakriyaaon ke sangyojan kii pratikriya swaroop vikaas karti he or saamagree jodne vaali or use hataane vaali prakriyaaon ke bich santulan ke saath jawaab detii he
 Such processes can operate at different scales of place and time
 sarvaadhik vyapak paimaane par, bhu-drishy kaa nirmaan vivartanik utthan or jwalamukhi ke madhyam se hota he
 Degradation is caused by erosion and extensive waste, creating sediment that is transported and deposited to other locations within the landscape or away from the coast
 uttarottar chote paimaane par, isi tarah kii avadharana lagu hoti he, jahaan ikai bhu-akritiyaan yogashil or ghataav prakriyaaon ke santulan ke jawaab main viksit hoti hai
 Modern geomorphology is the study of the divergence of the flow of material on the surface of a planet and is therefore closely associated with sedimentology, which can similarly be seen as the convergence of that flow
 bhu-akritik prakriyaayein vivartaniki, jalwaayu, paristhitiki, or maanav gatividhiyon se prabhavit hoti hai or samaan rup se inamen se kai kaarak dharti kii sataha par chal rahe vikaas se prabhavit ho sakate hai, udhaaharan ke liye, isostacy yaa parvatiy varshan ke madhyam se
 Many geomorphologists take particular interest in the possibility of feedback between climate and tectonics that mediate geomorphic processes

 With a few notable exceptions, geomorphology is a relatively new science, which has been growing with interest in other aspects of geology since the mid-19th century
 is khand main kuch pramukh akritiyon or unke vikaas kii ghatnaon ke bare main ek sankshipt ruparekha pradaan kii gai he
 The polytheistic Chinese scientist and politician Shen Kuo was perhaps the earliest to discover a theory of geomorphology
 yah prashanth mahaasaagar se saikadon mile kii duuri par ek pahaad ke bhuvaigyanik parat main samudri jeevashm ke khol ke uske avlokan par aadhaarit he
 When he saw the bicolor shell moving in a horizontal extension toward the erosion section of the cliff, he theorized that the reef was once the location of a pre-historic period seaward that moved hundreds of miles over the course of several centuries
 usne nishkarsh nikaala ki vah bhoomi pahaado kii mrudaa kataav or gaad ke jamaav ke kaaran bhinn rup main punargathit hui
 He said this when he saw the strange natural erosion of Taihang Mountains and Yandang Mountains near Wenzhou

 The first use of the term geomorphology was probably in German, when it appeared in Laumann's 1858 works
 kith tinkler kaa suzav he ki jab jon westle pavel or dablue
je
 micgi ne is shabd kaa istemaal 1891 ke antarrashtriya bhuvaigyanik sammelan main kiya to yah angreji, german or french main saamaanya upyog main aa gaya
 An early popular geomorphic model was the geographic cycle or erosion cycle developed by William Morris Davis between 1884 and 1899
 yah chakra ekarupathavaad ke siddhanton se prerit tha jise sarvapratham james haton ne prastaavit kiya tha
 In relation to valley-like shapes, uniformism characterized this cycle in a sequence in which a river cuts a valley as deep as possible, but then erosion of the side basins eventually recovers the area and reduces elevation Gives, after which regeneration can resume that cycle
 davis dwaara apane siddhant ke vikaas ke dashakon baad bhu-akruti vigyaan ke kai adhyayanon ne vyapak paimaane par bhudrishy vikaas ke liye apane vichaaron ko is saanche main baitaane kii koshish kii or unhen aaj aksar "devisian" kaha jaataa he
 Davis's ideas have largely been surpassed today, mainly because of his lack of predictive ability and qualitative nature, but he remains an extremely important figure in the history of the subject
 1920 ke dashak main, walter penk ne davis ke model kaa ek vaikalpik model viksit kiya, yah maanate hue ki sthalakriti vikaas ko utthan or anaachhadan kii satat prakriyaaon ke bich santulan ke rup main behatar paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he, naa ki davis ke ekal utthan ke baad hone vaale kshay ke rup main
 However, due to his untimely death at a relatively young age, the controversy with Davis and the lack of an English translation of his works did not gain widespread recognition for many years
 in lekhakon ne prithvi kii sataha ke vikaas ke adhyayan ko, pehle kii tulana main adhik saamanyakrit, vishwa str par praasangik aadhaar dene kaa prayaas kiya
 In the early 19th century, authors - particularly in Europe - attributed the local climate to landforms, and specifically to glaciation and periglacial processes
 iske vipareet, davis or penk, donon ne hi samay ke saath hone vaale bhudrishy vikaas ke mahatv or alag-alag paristhitiyon main alag-alag bhu-drishyon par prithvi kii satahi prakriyaaon kii saamanyata par jor dene kaa prayaas kiya
 While Pank and Davis and their followers were writing and studying primarily in Western Europe, another, largely segregated school of geomorphology developed in the United States in the mid-20th century
 20veen sadi kii shuruyaat main grove karl gilbert ke pathpradarshak kaaryon ke baad, prakritik vaigyanikon, bhuvaigyanikon or hydrolic ejiniyaron ke ek samooh ne, jisamen shaamil the ralf algar bagnold, jon hack, luna leopold, thomas medoc or arthur strolar ne bhudrishy aakaaron ke tatwon par anusandhan shuru kiya jaise ki nadi or pahari dhalaan, jiske liye unhone unke pahaluon kaa vyavasthit, pratyaksh, maatraatmak maapan liya or in maapon ke scalling kii chaanbin kii
 These methods began to allow predictions regarding the behavior of past and future landscapes based on current assessments and later evolved into quantitative geomorphology or geomorphometry
 aaj, bhu-akruti vigyaan ke kshetra main alag-alag drushtikonon or hiton kii ek bahut vyapak seemaa shaamil he
 Modern researchers try to derive quantitative "theories" that govern the Earth's surface processes, but equally, they recognize the specificity of each landscape and environment in which these processes operate
 samakaleen bhu-akruti vigyaan main vishesh mahatvapurn pratiti main shaamil hai: Modern geomorphology focuses on quantitative analysis of interrelated processes
 bhu-rasayan main aadhunik pragati, vishesh rup se cosmochemistry, isotope bhu-rasayan or fishan trek dating ne hamen pehali baar un daron ke maapan main sakasham banaaya he jis par bhu-akritik prakriyaayein, bhugarbheey rup se praasangik samayrekha par ghatit hoti hai
 At the same time, the use of more precise physical measurement techniques, including piercing GPS, remotely sensed digital terrain models, and laser scanning techniques, have allowed the quantification and study of these processes
 iske baad computer simulation or modelling kaa upyog tab yah samajhane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he ki kaise ye prakriyaayein ek saath or samyavadhi main kaam karti hai
 Most processes that are geologically relevant can be considered either erosive, translational, or a combination of the two
 Deposition processes are mostly considered within the field of sedimentology, but are often understood as part of geomorphology as well
 apkshay, prithvi kii saamagree kaa vayumandaleey yaa sataha ke nazadiiki agenton se sampark ke kaaran hone vaala rasinic or bhautik vighatan he
 The products of these changes near the surface can later be carried away by various factors of erosion
 bhu-vaigyanik dwaara jaanch kii jane vaali prakriyaaon kii prakruti, drudh rup se jaanch main shaamil bhudrishy yaa sthalakriti par or samay or lambaai rekha kii ruchi par nirbhar he
 However, the following non-detailed list provides a glimpse of the landscape elements associated with some of these
 praathmik satahi prakriyaayein jo adhikansh sthalakritik swaroopon ke liye jimmedaar he, usamen shaamil he hawa, lahar, rasinic vighatan, jan vinaash, bhoojal gatividhi, satahi jal pravaah, him karrwai, vivartaniki or jwalamukhi
 Other more severe geomorphic processes may include periglacial processes, salt-mediated action, or extraterrestrial effects
 nadiyaan or dharaaen, keval pani kii hi vaahak nahin hai balki talachat kii bhi hai
 Water, when flowing over the surface, is able to use sediments and carry them downstream, either as bottom load or suspended load, or as dissolved load
 talachat parivahan kii dar, swayan talachat kii uplabdhta or nadi ke nirvahan par nirbhar karti he
 Rivers are also capable of eroding new rocks and creating new sediments, by their bottom and coupling with the surrounding mountain slopes
 In this way, rivers are thought to be responsible for establishing the base level for large-scale landscapes in non-glacial environments
 vibhinn bhudrishy tatwon ke sampark main nadiyaan mahatvapurn sutara hai
 When rivers flow through topographies, they generally become larger in size and merge with other rivers
 is prakaar gathit nadiyon kaa network ek apvaah tantra he or aksar vrikshnuma hota he, lekin antarnihit bhuvigyaan or sthaneey sthalakriti ke aadhaar par anya swaroop bhi dhaaran kar saktaa he
 Eolian processes are related to the movement of air and, more specifically, to the ability of Hava to shape the Earth's surface
 Winds can erode, transport, and deposit things, and these winds are more effective in areas where vegetation is sparse and there is an adequate supply of sediment
 haalanki pani or brihat pravaah, adhikansh vaataavaran main hawa kii tulana main adhik chizon kaa istemaal karata he, vaiudh prakriyaayein shushk vaataavaran main mahatvapurn hai, registan
 Soils, regoliths and boulders move under the influence of gravity, crawling, rolling, flowing, falling
 aisi brihad tuutan sthaliy or dhalaanon par hoti he or inhen prithvi, mangal shukr, titan or iapets par dekha gaya he
 Processes running on mountain slopes can change the topology of the slope surface, which in turn can change the rates of those processes
 aisi dhalaane jo najuk sthiti tak gahari ho jaati hai ve badi maatra main saamagree ko jaldi-jaldi chhodane main sakasham ho jaati hai, jisase dhalaani prakriya vivartanik rup se sakriy kshetron main bhudrishy kaa ek mahatvapurn tatva ban jaati hai
 On Earth, biological processes such as digging or tree throws can play an important role in determining the rates of some sloping processes
 himandi, jo ki bhugolic rup se simit he, bhudrishy parivartan ke prabhavi kaarak hai
 The gradual movement of snow down the valley causes friction and uprooting of the rock below
 gharshan se maheen talachat kaa nirmaan hota he, jise himand aataa kehete hai
 The debris transported by the glacier after it is finished is called Moren
 himand kataav, you aakaar kii ghaatiyon ke liye jimmedaar he, jo ki nadi dwaara banaai gai ve aakaar kii ghaatiyon ke vipareet he
 The way glaciers process contact with other landscape elements, especially with slopes and river processes, is an important aspect of plio-pleistocene landscape development and its sediments are found in many high mountain environments
 jo vaataavaran apekshaakrit haal hi main himachhadit hue hai magar ab nahin hai, ve un bhudrushyon ke mukaable jo kabhi himachhadit nahin hue, ab bhi ucch bhudrishy parivartan dar ko dikhaa sakate hai
 Non-glacial geomorphic processes that have also been adapted by earlier glaciation are called paraglacial processes
 yah avadharana, perigleshial prakriyaaon kii virodhabhasi he, jo barf yaa paale ke nirmaan yaa pighalaav dwaara sidhe sanchalit hoti he
 The tectonic effect on geomorphology can range from millions of years to a minute or less
 bhudrishy par vivartaniki kaa prabhaav baari rup se anternihit chattani aadhaaron kii banaavat par nirbhar karata he jo is baat ko niyantrit karata he ki vivartaniki kis prakaar kii sthaneey aakaariki ko janm degi
 Earthquakes, within minutes, can inundate vast terrain and give rise to wetlands
 isostetic paltaav ke kaaran saikadon yaa hazaron saal main mahatvapurn parivartan ho saktaa he or isse parvatiy shrinkhalaa ko atirikt kataav kii anumati milti he, kyonki shrinkhalaa se bade hisse ko hataa diya jaataa he or katibandh kaa utthan hota he
 Long-term plate tectonic dynamics induce orogenic tropics, massive mountain ranges with a million-year lifespan, which are the focus of high-rate processes of river and hill slopes, and thus produce long-term depressions
 gahari papadi gatishiltaa kii visheshtaayen, jaise ki plums or nimna sthalmandal kaa gaiyr-paratbandi ko bhi mana jaataa he ki dirghakaalin avadhi main dharti kii sthalakriti ke bade paimaane par vikaas main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaati he
 Both can induce regeneration through isostasy, as the hot, low-density crust rocks displace the relatively cold, high-density crust rocks inside the earth
 jwalamukheey or vitaleey aagney prakriyaaon kaa bhu-akruti vigyaan par mahatvapurn prabhaav ho saktaa he
 The occurrence of the volcano renews the landscape and covers the old surface of the land with lava and tephra and releases pyroclastic material and leads the rivers to new paths
 visphoton dwaara nirmit shanku bhi paryaapt nai sthalakriti banaata he, jis par anya satahi prakriyaayein apana kaam kar sakati hai
 The subsurface activity of lava also plays a role in geomorphology
 sataha ke neeche chalata pighalaav jamini sataha kii sfiti or avasfiti kaa kaaran bana saktaa he or tibet ke neeche aanshik rup se pighali hui bhupatal parat ko hazaron kilometre par faile tibeti pathaar kii bhu-akruti ko niyantrit karne kaa yogadan diya gaya he
 The interaction of organisms with geomorphology or bio-geomorphic processes can occur in many forms and is probably quite important overall for terrestrial geomorphic systems
 jeev vigyaan, kai bhu-akritik prakriyaaon ko prabhavit kar saktaa he, jiskaa kshetra rasinic apkshay ko niyantrit karne vaali jaev bhu-rasinic prakriyaaon se lekar yantric prakriyaaon ke prabhaav tak he jaise mrudaa vikaas par khudaai or tree thro or yahaan tak ki vaishvik apradan dar ko carbon dioxide santulan ke madhyam se jalwaayu kaa aaparivartan karte hue niyantrit karnaa bhi isamen shaamil he
 Terrestrial landscapes that can certainly exclude the role of biology in mediating surface processes are extremely rare, but they can provide important information to understand the geomorphology of other planets such as Mars Huh
 alag-alag sthanik or loukik paimaanon par alag-alag bhu-akritik prakriyaaon kaa prabhutv hota he
 In addition, the scales at which processes occur may dictate reactions or other forms of landscape changes to the motivating hair, such as climate or tectonics
 ye vichaar, aaj bhu-akruti vigyaan ke adhyayan ke liye mahatvapurn hai
 Physiologists can use the following classifications to classify landscape measurements: khevar vidroh jharkhand main bhagirath, dubai gosai or patel singh ke netritv main angrezi ke viruddh 1832-33 main hua vidroh he
 The paste that is prepared by mixing certain natural things in a certain amount is called ubutan
 ubtan kaa chalan kaaphi purana he
 It is counted among sixteen adornments
 hamaari daadi-nani, vividh prakaar ke ubtano kaa prayog karke hi apane saundarya ko nikharati thim, kyonki us samay beauty parloron kaa itnaa bolbalaa nahin tha
 Even in ancient times, queens and nobles used different types of boils

93khajuraho bharat ke madhya pradesh praant main sthit ek pramukh shahar he jo apane pracheen evam madhyakaalin mandiron ke liye vishwavikhyath he
 It is located in Chhatarpur district of Madhya Pradesh
 khajuraho ko pracheen kaal main khajurpura or khajur vahika ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha
 There are a large number of ancient Hindu and Jain temples here
 mandiron kaa shahar khajuraho puure vishwa main mude hue pattharon se nirmit mandiron ke liye prasiddh he
 Khajuraho is known for its ornate temples which are the finest medieval monuments in the country
 bharat ke alaava duniya bhar ke aaagantuk or paryatak prem ke is apratim saundarya ke pratik ko dekhne ke liye nirantar aate rahete he
 The craftsmen of Hindu art and culture were engraved on the stones of this city in the medieval period
 sambhog kii vibhinn kalaon ko in mandiron main behad khubsuurati ke ubhaara gaya he
 The history of Khajuraho is about a thousand years old
 yah shahar chandel samrajya kii pratham rajdhani tha
 Chandra Dynasty and the founder of Khajuraho were Chandravarman
 chandravarman madhyakaal main bundelkhand main shashan karne vaale gurjar raja the
 They considered themselves to be Chandravanshi
 chandel raajaaon ne dasvin se barahavi shatabdi tak madhya bharat main shashan kiya
 The temples of Khajuraho were built between 950 AD and 1050 AD by these Chandela kings
 mandiron ke nirmaan ke baad chandelo ne apni rajdhani mahoba sthanantarit kar di
 But even after this, the importance of Khajuraho remained
 madhyakaal ke darbari kavi chandbardaai ne prithviraj raso ke mahoba khand main chandel kii utpatti kaa varnan kiya he
 He has written that Hemavati, the daughter of the Rajpandit of Kashi, was the master of beauty
 ek din vah garmiyon kii raat main camel-pushpon se bhare hue talab main snaan kar rahi thi
 Seeing her beauty, Lord Chandra was fascinated by them
 ve maanav rup dharankar dharti par aa gaye or hemavathi kaa haran kar liya
 Unfortunately Hemvati was a widow
 vah ek bachche kii maa thi
 He accused Chandradev of destroying his life and abusing the character

 The campaign will include a lunar orbiter built in India and a rover and a lander
 is sab kaa vikaas isro dwaara kiya jaayegaa
 India is planning to launch Chandrayaan-2 in 2019
 isro ke anusaar yah abhiyaan vibhinn nayi praudyogikiyon ke istemaal tathaa pareekshan ke saath-saath nae prayog bhi karegaa
 The wheeled rover will run on the surface of the moon and collect soil or rock samples for analysis
 aankadon ko chandrayan-2 orbitor ke madhyam se prithvi par bheja jaayegaa
 The team that successfully carried out the Chandrayaan-1 campaign under the leadership of Mylaswamy Annadurai is also working on Chandrayaan-2
 12 navambar 2007 ko isro or roosi antariksh agency ke pratinidhiyon ne chandrayan-2 pariyojna par saath kaam karne ke ek samjhaute par hastakshar kiye
 The main responsibility of the orbiter and the rover will be that of ISRO and the Roskosmos will be responsible for the lander
 bharat sarkaar ne 18 sitambar 2008 ko pradhanmantri manmohan singh kii adhyakshata main yojit kendriya mantrimandal kii baithak main is abhiyaan ko sweekruti di thi
 The design of the spacecraft was completed in August 2009, in which scientists of both countries made their joint contribution
 haalanki isro ne chandrayan -2 kaarykram ke anusaar pelod ko antim rup diya
 But the campaign was postponed in January 2013
 tathaa abhiyaan ko 2016 ke liye punarnirdhaarit kiya
 Because Russia was unable to develop the lander in time
 roskosmos ko baad main mangal grah ke liye bheje phobose-grant abhiyaan me mili vifaltaa ke kaaran chandrayan -2 kaarykram se alag kar diya gaya
 And India decided to develop the lunar mission independently
 is abhiyaan ko sriharikota dweep ke satish dhawan antariksh centre se bhusthir upgrah prakshepan yaan dwaara bheje jane kii yojana he; udaan ke samay iskaa vajan lagbhag 3,250 kilo hoga

 Three payloads are new, while two others are improved versions of payloads to be sent on the Chandrayaan-1 orbiter
 udaan ke samay iskaa vajan lagbhag 1400 kilo hoga
 The orbiter high resolution camera will give high resolution photographs of the landing site before the lander separates from the orbiter
 orbitor or uske jieselvi prakshepan yaan ke bich interphes ko antim rup de diya he
 Unlike the Moon Impact Probe of Chandrayaan-1, which hits the lunar surface, the lander will descend slowly
 lander kisi bhi vaigyanik gatividhiyon pradarshan nahin karenge
 The lander and rover will weigh about 1250 kg
 prarambh main, lander rus dwaara bharat ke saath sahyog se viksit kiye jane kii ummid thi
 When Russia expressed its inability to develop the lander before 2015
 to bhartiya adhikariyon ne swatantra rup se lander ko viksit karne kaa nirnay liya
 Russia meant to cancel the lander
 ki mishan profil parivartit ho jaaegi
 The study of the initial configuration of the indigenous lander was completed in 2013 by the Space Applications Center, Ahmedabad

 The main engine of the lander has been successfully tested for a period of 513 seconds
 sensor or software ke band loop satyaapan pareekshan 2016 ke madhya main pareekshan karne kii yojana banaai he
 The engineering model of the lander underwent groundwater and aerial tests in late October 2016 at Chunlare in Chitradurga district, Karnataka
 isro ne landing site kaa chayan karne ke liye or lander ke sensor kii kshamta kaa akalan karne main sahaayta ke liye chunalere main kareeb 10 cretar banaae
 The rover will weigh between 20-30 kg and will be powered by solar energy
 The rover will move on the surface of the moon with wheels, collect samples of soil and rocks, analyze them chemically and send the data up to the orbiter from where it will be sent to the station of the Earth
 praarambhik yojana main rover ko rus main dizin or bharat main nirmit kiya janaa tha
 However, Russia refused to design the rover in May 2010
 iske baad, isro ne rover ke dizin or nirmaan khud karne kaa faisla kiya
 IIT Kanpur developed three subsystems of Rover to provide mobility: isro ne ghoshnaa kii he ki ek visheshgy samiti ke nirnay ke anusaar orbitor par paanch tathaa rover par do pelod bheje jaayenge
 haalanki shuruyaat main bataaya gaya tha ki nasa tathaa iese bhi is abhiyaan main bhaag lenge or orbitor ke liye kuch vaigyanik upkarnon ko pradaan karenge, isro ne baad main spasht kiya ki vajan pratibandhon ke chalate vah is abhiyaan par kisi bhi gaiyr-bhartiya pelod ko saath nahin le jaayegi
 ISRO plans to launch Chandrayaan-2 in 2018
 maury rajvansh pracheen bharat kaa ek shaktishaalee evam mahaan rajvansh kamboj vansh tha
 It ruled India for 137 years
 isaki sthapana kaa shrey chandragupta maury or uske mantri kautilya ko diya jaataa he, jinhone nand vansh ke samraat ghananand jo ki chandragupta maury ke shotele bhai ko parajeet kiya
 The credit of expanding and strengthening the Mauryan Empire goes to Emperor Ashoka
 yah samrajya purv main magadh rajya main ganga nadi ke maidaanon se shuru hua
 Its capital was Pataliputra
 chandragupta maury ne 322 isa purv main is samrajya kii sthapana kii or teji se pashchim kii taraf apana samrajya kaa vikaas kiya
 He took advantage of the differences of several small regional states which were born after the invasion of Alexander
 316 isa purv tak maury vansh ne puure uttari pashchimi bharat par adhikaar kar liya tha
 The Maurya dynasty greatly expanded in the kingdom of Chakravarti Emperor Ashoka
 samraat ashok ke kaaran hi maury samrajya sabase mahaan evam shaktishaalee banakar vishvabhar main prasiddh hua
 In 325 BCE, northwestern India was ruled by the satrap of Sikandar
 jab sikandar punjab par chadhaai kar rahaa tha to ek brahman jiskaa naam chanakya tha magadh ko samrajya vistaar ke liye protsaahit karne aayaa
 At that time, Magadha was quite powerful and pricked the eyes of its neighboring states
 par tatkaaleen magadh ke samraat ghananand ne usko thukraa diya
 He said that you are a pundit and take care of your peak "war is the king's job, you are a pundit, only do panditai"
 Since then Chanakya took a vow that he would teach Dhanananda a lesson
 maury pracheen kshatriya kabeeley ke hisse rahe he
 According to Greek sources such as Brahmin literature, Visakhadatta Mudrarakshas and Justin, etc
, there were no opinions of historians about the origin of Maurya
 Some scholars also believe that Chandragupta Maurya has originated from his mother Mura
 Maurya is, they were the clan that followed the peacocks
 parantu yah bhi sateek nahi baithta bhartiya itihaas main yah pehali baar hua mata ke naam se putr kaa vansh chalaa ho maury ek shaktishaalee vansh tha vah unke pita se viraasat main mili thi putr kaa naam pita se hi judaa hota he, unki utpatti vrushal vansh se huyi thi, lekin iskaa koi bhi pramaan itihaas main uplabdh nahin he yah keval tark he kuki ajtak itihaas main kisi ne bhi apane vansh kaa naam mata ke naam se nahin rakhaa, to kuch itihaaskaaro kaa yah sirf anumaan he
 
 chandragupta usee gana pramukh kaa putr tha jo kii chandragupta ke bal avasthaa main hi yoddha ke rup main maaraa gaya
 Chandragupta had the natural qualities to become a king ', seeing this ability, Chanakya made him his disciple, and laid the foundation of a strong nation which is an ideal till date
 iske baad bharat bhar main jasuson kaa ek jaal sa bicha diya gaya jisase raja ke khilaaf gaddari ityadi kii gupt soochna ekatra karne main kiya jaataa tha - yah bharat main shaayad abhootpurv tha
 Once this happened, he prepared Chandragupta to drive away the Greek satraps
 is kaary main use guptcharon ke vistrut jaal se madad mili
 In the invasion of Magadha, Chanakya provoked civil war in Magadha
 uske guptcharon ne nand ke adhikariyon ko rishwat dekar unhe apane paksh main kar liya
 After this, the Nanda ruler left his post and Chanakya got Vijayashree
 nand ko nirvasit jivan jeena padaa jiske baad uskaa kya hua ye agyaat he
 Chandragupta Maurya also won the public's trust and with this he also got the right to power
 us samay magadh bharat kaa sabase shaktishaalee rajya tha
 After the capture of Magadha, Chandragupta occupied the center of power
 chandragupta ne pashchimi tathaa dakshini bharat par vijay abhiyaan aarambh kiya
 Its information comes from indirect evidence
 rudradaaman ke junagarh shilaalekh main likhaa he ki sinchai ke liye sudarshan jhil par ek band pushyagupt dwaara banaaya gaya tha
 Pushyagupta was the provincial governor of Ashoka at that time
 pashchimottar bharat ko unani shashan se mukti dilaane ke baad uskaa dhyaan dakshin kii taraf gaya
 Chandragupta defeated Alexander's commander Seleucus around 305 BC
 greek vivaran is vijay kaa ullekh nahin karte hai par itnaa kehete hai ki chandragupta or celukas ke bich ek sandhi hui thi jiske anusaar celukas ne qandahar, kabul, heraat or baluchistan ke pradesh chandragupta ko de die the
 With this, Chandragupta presented him 500 elephants
 itnaa bhi kaha jaataa he chandragupta ne celukas kii beti se vaivaahik sambandh sthapit kiya tha
 Seleucus sent Megasthenes to the court of Chandragupta as ambassador
 plutark ke anusaar "sandrokotus us samay tak singhasanarudh ho chukaa tha, usne apane 6,00,000 sainikon kii sena se sampoorn bharat ko rond daalaa or apane adheen kar liya"
 This comment may be called a little exaggeration because it is known that the Cauvery river and its south areas were ruled by the Cholas, Pandyas, Satyaputras and Keralaputras at that time
 ashok ke shilaalekh karnataka main chittaldurg, yeragudi tathaa maski main paae gaye hai
 In his inscription Sermon i and Trayodash, description of his neighbors Chola, Pandya and other states is found
 chunki aisi koi jaankaree nahin milti ki ashok yaa uske pita bindusaar ne dakshin main koi yuddh ladaa ho or usamen vijay praapt kii ho atah aisa mana jaataa he unpar chandragupta ne hi vijay praapt kii thi
 In the latter part of his life, he had embraced Jainism and renounced the throne and lived a monastic life with his mentor Jainmuni Bhadrabahu in Shravanabelagola, Karnataka
 chandragupta ke baad uskaa putr bindusaar sattarudh hua par uske bare main adhik gyaat nahin he
 The extension of the empire towards the south is sometimes credited to Bindusara, although there is no evidence of his conquests
 jain parampara ke anusaar uski maan kaa naam durdhar tha or puraanon main varnit bindusaar ne 25 varshon tak shashan kiya tha
 He is also given the title of Amitraghata which is given the name of Amitrochtas in Greek texts
 bindusar aajivak dharam ko maanata tha
 He demanded a dry emperor, sweet wine and a philosopher from a Greek ruler, Antiochus I
 samraat ashok, bharat ke hi nahin balki vishwa ke itihaas ke sabase mahaan shaskaon main se ek hai
 Apart from the expansion of the empire, he is named with great rulers like Akbar in the field of administration and religious tolerance
 haalanki ve akbar se bahoot shaktishaalee evam mahaan samraat rahe he
 Many scholars even consider Emperor Ashoka as the most successful ruler in world history
 apane rajkumaar ke dinon main unhone ujjain tathaa takshashila ke vidrohon ko dabaa diya tha
 But the battle of Kalinga proved to be a turning point in his life and his mind was filled with guilt over the war massacre

 The historical Mahendru Ghat of Patna is named after him
 yuddh se man ub jane ke baad bhi samraat ashok ne ek badi sena ko banaae rakhaa tha
 This was necessary to prevent the fall of the empire from foreign invasion

 Scholars say that the administration of Pataliputra and other cities at that time must have been in accordance with this principle
 megasthaneez ne patliputra ke prashasan kaa varnan kiya he
 According to him the city of Pataliputra was ruled by a city council consisting of 30 members

 Each committee had a certain function
 pehali samiti kaa kaam audyogic tathaa kalatmak utpaadan se sambandhit tha

 Various types of officers were also appointed by the city council to do public welfare, such as - roads, markets, hospitals, temples, educational institutions, water supply, repair and maintenance of ports
 nagar kaa pramukh adhikari nagarak kehalaata tha
 Kautilya has also mentioned several departments in the city administration that used to regulate many activities of the city, such as Accounts Department, Revenue Department, Mines and Minerals Department, Chariot Department, Customs and Tax Department
 maury samrajya ke samay ek or baat jo bharat main abhootpurv thi wo thi mauryo kaa guptchar jaal
 At that time, a network of detectives was spread in the entire state, who used to inform the administration and army about any external attack or internal rebellion on the state
 bharat main sarvapratham maury vansh ke shasankaal main hi rashtriya raajnneetik ekta sthapit hui thi
 There was strong centralization of power in the Mauryan administration but the king was not autocratic
 maury kaal main ganatantr kaa hraas hua or rajtantratmak vyavastha sudrudh hui
 Kautilya had specified the state weekend principle, on the basis of which the Mauryan administration and its home and foreign policy were governed - Raja, Amatya Janpad, Durg, Kosh, Sena and, Mitra

 In the sixth century BCE, the existence of some 62 sects has been revealed in which the rise of Buddhist and Jain sects increased more than others later

 iske baad ke shilalekhon main bi aisa paaya jaataa he ki chandragupta ne usee sthaan par ek sachche nishthavan jain kii tarah aamaran upwas karke dam todaa tha
 There is a hill named Chandragiri nearby, which was probably named after Chandragupta
 ashok ne kaling yuddh ke baad buddha dharm ko apana liya tha
 After this he focused his attention in the promotion of Dhamma
 yahaan dhamm kaa matlab koi dharm yaa mazahab yaa relizan na hokar "naitik siddhant" tha
 At that time neither Islam nor Christianity was born
 atah ve naitik siddhant us samay baahar ke kisi dharm kaa virodh karnaa nahin hokar manushya ko ek naitik niyam pradaan karnaa tha
 In his second inscription he has written - "what is Dhamma? Minor misdeeds and more virtues

 Dragons can be around 25 to 35 meters in length for more acrobatic models, and for larger, parade and ritual styles, it can be as long as 50 to 70 meters because the dragon-related legend is as tall as the dragon
 That will bring more luck
 The size and length of the dragon depends on the available manpower, financial power, material, skill, and size of the field

 Basic skills can be learned easily but to become a competent demonstrator one has to train with the body until the movement becomes your second nature and control over complex structures can be achieved - which can only be done by a single member It depends not only on the skill but also on the concentration of the entire team movement together

 Web colors are colors that are used to design web pages
 web roopankan ke kartaaon ke paas bahut vikalp hote hai, in rangon ko web ghatakon kaa vivaran dene hetu
 These can be described as RGB triplets in a conspiracy form
 web rang ve rang hote hai, jo ki web panne roopankan hetu prayog hote hai
 Web design authors have a lot of options to describe these colors to web components
 inhen bataaya ja saktaa he jaise shaddashamalav roopakar main RGB triplate
 a conscript triplet is a six-digit, three-byte plot number, used in HTML to display colors
 teenon bite darshaati hai kisi ek rang ke laal, haraa, nila ghatak
 a byte is from 00 to FF, or 0 to 255
 This represents the least to the most intensity of each of the color components
 The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order: For example, consider the color where the red / green / blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 
 The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are 24, 68 and A0 respectively in hexadecimal notation
 To obtain the hex triplet, we simply write the three hex bytes together without spaces, thus: 2468A0
 If a byte is less than 10 or 16 it must be represented with a leading zero to keep the number of digits in the triplet equal to six
 For example, the decimal triplet 0,1,2 would be represented by the hex triplet 000102
 The number of colors that can be represented by this system is An abbreviated, three digit form is sometimes used
 Expanding this form to the six-digit form is as simple as doubling each digit: 09C becomes 0099CC
 This allows each color value to cover its full range from 00 to FF
 Converting a decimal RGB value to a hexadecimal value is fairly straightforward
 Decimal RGB values are usually given in the 0-255 range; if they are in the 0-1 range, multiply the value by 255 before conversion
 This number divided by 16 gives us the first hexadecimal digit
 The remainder, times 16 again, gives us the second digit
 For instance the RGB value 201 divides into 12 groups of 16, thus the first digit is C
 a remainder of 9 gives us the hexadecimal number C9
 This process is repeated for each of the three color values
 Most modern operating systems have a built-in calculator to perform conversions between number bases and this can also be done with some hand-held calculators
 This task can also be carried out using various web resources
 The HTML 4
01 specification defines sixteen named colors, as follows : These 16 were also specified as srgb and included in the HTML 3
0 specification which noted "these colors were originally picked as being the standard 16 colors supported with the Windows VGA palette
" In addition, a number of colors are defined by web browsers
 a particular browser may not recognize all of these colors, but as of 2005 all modern general-use browsers support the full list
 Many of these colors are from the list of X11 color names distributed with the x Window System
 These colors were standardized by SVG 1
0, and are accepted by SVG Full user agents
 They are not part of SVG Tiny
 Almost the exact same color names are used in the 
NET Framework, in the knowncolor and Color enumerations
 The only color difference is darkseagreen which is defined as 8F, BC, 8B
 The list of web "X11 colors" from the CSS3 specification, along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents, is shown below, compare the alphabetical lists in the W3C standards
 Template: Color depthanother set of 216 color values is commonly considered to be the "web-safe" color palette, developed at a time when many computer displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors
 a set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on 256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six shades each of red, green, and blue
 The "web-safe" colors do not all have names, but each can be specified by an RGB triplet
 Below are the values for the 6 shades of each color out of 256 possible color shades
 The following table shows all of the "web-safe" colors, underlining the really-safe colors
 The lack of gamma correction means that the six desired intensities are 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%
 are displayed as 0%, 2%, 10%, 28%, 57%, and 100% on a Windows standard 2
5 gamma CRT or LCD, making most colors very dark
 The intensities at the low end of the range, especially 0 and 3, are nearly indistinguishable from each other: Note that in the table below, each color code listed is a short-hand for the RGB value; for example, code 609 is equivalent to RGB code 660099
 The Cascading Style Sheets language defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 listed previously
additionally, CSS 2
1 adds the 'orange' color name to the list: CSS 2, SVG and CSS 2
1 also allow web authors to use so-called system colors, which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system
 This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent
 As of early 2004, it appears that the CSS3 color module will once again drop these values, marking them deprecated, but this may change
 The developing CSS3 specification will also introduce HSL color space values to style sheets: pracheen misr ke dharm kii ek devi
 It was the goddess of the sky and was also shown as Gau

 With the subtlety of the original 'nature', every knowledge of it is impossible, but as its 'deformity' importance etc
 it is perceptible
 'parinaam', chunki utpann hota he, anitya, assam tathaa gatiyukt he, ishwarkrishna ke anusaar sukh-du:kha-moh kaa swabhaav 'prakruti' kaa he, purush kaa nahin
 Therefore, salvation is of 'nature perversion', not of man
 satv, raj tathaa trigun prakruti ke hai or kramash: satviktaa, kriya tathaa jadta ke kaaran
 The function of these qualities is like a lamp to pave the way to salvation
 ishwarkrishna 'purush' ko achetan prakruti kaa 'viparyay' bataate hai, at: 'purush', 'prakruti' kii achetan kriyaaon kaa chetan drashtaa he, karta nahin
 The existence of the 'purusha' is proved by the altruism, instinct and salvation nature of the physical trauma

 In summary, the worldly state of man is his affection for the actions of nature and the state of 'kaivalya' is the separation of nature from nature, 'nivitha' or self-nature of nature

 Which remains intact until the end, if you do not erase it separately
 parmparik vidhi, jiskaa prayog kritidev lekhan vidhi ke rup main Microsoft Word main hota he, usamen aisi koi kami nahin he par wo unicode vidhi na hone ke kaaran Microsoft Word ke baahar kahin bhi samarthit nahin hoti
 To overcome this shortcoming of Remington method, Shiv Shankar Gupta "invented the new Remington method" classic-remington method
