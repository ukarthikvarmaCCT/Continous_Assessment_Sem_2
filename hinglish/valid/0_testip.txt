 The home's dining room works well in both small or big places, but only when every element of the dining room system is taken care of
 vah cameraa jise aahaar-kaksh bananaa he, usamen furniture se dur paryaapt sthaan hona chahie jisase nuksaan se bachaa ja sake
 sabase kushal aahaar-kaksh ke teble set ap main ek yaa do mej hoti he jinaki chaudaai thaaliyon kii do panktiyon ke liye paryaapt ho
 yah mehmaanon ko swayan teble ke donon ore se sarv karne kii suvidha detaa he, isse sarv karne kii prakriya tej ho jaati he or khaanaa girane kaa khatra kam ho jaataa he
 The table of the dining room should be arranged in a logical order, in which the plate should be placed first, then the main dish and then the rest of the dishes
 The last should have utensils and napkins
 If possible, sweets and especially beverages should be served from a separate table which should be away from the main table
 This helps prevent it from falling
 aahaar-kaksh mej brannvinsboard - 16 sadi ke madhya se swedish snap kii mej se utpann hui he or 18 veen sadi kii shuruyaat main yah mahatvapurn ho gayi thi or yah aahaar-kaksh main, jiske bare main aaj ham adhik jaanate hai, 19 veen sadi kii shuruyaat se pehle viksit nahin thi
 The popularity of the smorgasboard dining room did not increase until the expansion of the railroads in Europe
 smorgasboard teble ek prakaar kaa khaanaa he jahaan mehmaan ratribhoj se purv pine ke liye ekatrit hote he or yah aupchaarik dinar kaa hissaa nahin tha
 The Smorgasboard Diet Room was often held in separate rooms for women and men before dinner was served
 smorgasboard antarrashtriya str par 1939 neuyork vishwa pradarshnee main prasiddh hua kyonki sweden ko swedish bhojan ke sarvshereshth pradarshan kaa nayaa tarika viksit karnaa tha
 The term dining room originally relates to the French sideboard where food was served, but eventually became used for this model
 sweden desh ke nivaasiyon dwaara neuyark main smorgasboard kaa upyog karne ke baad 19 ve sadi ke madhya main aahaar-kaksh angreji bolne vaale vyaktiyon kii duniya main lokapriy ho gaya
 The word is still accepted in the English language
 jis samay sone or chaandi ke aadhipaty dwaara shashan kii rin shodhan kshamta kii maap kii jaati thi, us samay plate or bartanon ke rup main kiya gaya yah pradarshan ek vishisht upbhog kii cheshtaa ke bajaay ek raajnneetik adhinium adhik tha
 The 16th-century French term dining room refers to both the display and the furniture on which it is placed and often decorated well but with the use of carved ornate shelves as they progressed
 Felt on which things to eat were kept
 england main is tarah ke aahaar-kaksh ko court kabird kaha gaya tha
 The expensive method of displaying the plate was first revived in the fashionable court of Burgundy and adopted in France
 chaandi or sone kaa atyalankrita pradarshan jo france ke lui XIV dwaara prabhavit hua tha wo alekajender francis desports or anya dwaara chitron ke rup main amar kar diya gaya tha isse pehle ki uske shashan ke ant samay main yudhon ke bhugtan karne ke liye lui kii plate or chaandi ke furniture ko taksaal bheja jaye
 During the 18th century, more subtle displays of solvency were preferred
 sadi ke ant main aahaar-kaksh us samay england or frans main punerjeevit hua jab ekaantata ke nae aadarshon ne naashte ke samay swayan seva ko naam maatr kaa bana diya, yahaan tak ki un logon ke madhya bhi jinaki prayek kursi ke peeche ek paidal chalanevaala ho saktaa he
 In the Cabinet Dictionary of 1803, Thomas Sheraton gave a neoclassical design, stating that "with some justification the dining-room can be restored for modern use and can be ornamental for a modern breakfast-room, which is the cabinet of China's tea aquapiz
" The repository's answer is "
 1922 main haau tu pripear and sarv e mile naam kii ek pustak main lillian bi
 lensdowne ne likhaa he: The concept of eating food in the dining room originated in France in the mid-17th century when gentlemen visited the homes of women they wanted to woo unexpectedly
 unka ekaek aagaman rasoi karmchaariyon ke madhya aatank failaa saktaa tha or us samay keval vahi khaanaa parosa ja saktaa tha jiskaa chayan cold room main rakhe khaane se kiya gaya he
 The credit for the "all You Can Eat" diet room goes to Herb mcdonald, Hotel Manager of Minneapolis, Minnesota, who proposed the idea in 1946
 1965 main aahaar-kaksh ke bare main unke dwaara likhe gaye upanyaas, di muses of ruin, main wiliam pimmersan ne likhaa he: There is a tendency to misuse the word "diet-room" to specify "all you can eat" miles, even when the food is not prepared in advance and is not placed on the table but rather you set a price
 And you can order anything from the menu any time you want
 sanyukt rajya america main, aahaar-kaksh ek badi aahaar-kaksh shrinkhalaa nigam he jo puraane desh ke aahaar-kaksh, desh ke aahaar-kaksh, agni parvat, rayaan ke stellhouse or home toun ke aahaar-kaksh ke swami he

 However, in situations where there is a compulsion to stay in a hot environment for a long time or to wear protective equipment, the need for an individual cooling system is essential for health and safety purposes
 sakriy yaa niskriy praudyogikiyon kii nijee shitalan pranali kii kai kism maujuud hai jise unke urja stronton ke dwaara vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he or chaahe ve manushya ho yaa vaahan-ghudsavaar
 Due to the wide variety of operating conditions, an individual cooling system must have the ability to meet specific requirements, such as cooling rate and cooling period, physical mobility and autonomy, access to energy, and conformance with health and safety regulations
 
 For example, the active liquid system operates on the basis of cold water and is transmitted through a livery that cools the skin surface area, covering it through convection
 is prakaar kii pranali kuch sainya, kanoon pravartan or audyogic anuprayogon main safal sabit hui he
 Wearing a bomb suit to provide protection against an improvised explosive device, bomb disposal technicians tie a small, ice-based cooling unit to their feet with a liquid circulating livery, which is usually used to keep their core temperature at a protective level
 The vest is fastened to the top of your torso for maintenance

 Passive cooling techniques, such as resting in cold and shady places and removing your clothes from the body, etc
 can be implemented immediately
 sakriy shitalan pranali, jaise sir, gardan or dhad ko thande pani se ponchna, sharir se garmi ko dur karnaa jaise upayon se sharir kii saamaanya taapmaana kii vaapasi ho sakati he
 Drinking water from a person suffering from hyperthermia and sitting or resting in front of a fan or dehumidifying air conditioning can improve the body's effect of evaporative cooling system
 gunagune yaa thande pani ke ek bath tub main baithne se apekshaakrit kam samay main adhikansh taap ko baahar nikaala ja saktaa he
 However, sitting in more cold water can reverse, as it causes the blood vessels in the skin to shrink and thus prevents the heat from being released from the original body
 shram aadhaarit ooshmaataap main, adhyayan se pataa chalaa he ki haalanki isamen vyaavhaarik simaaen hai, thande pani main baithna sabase prabhavi shitalan takanic he or nattejey kaa sabase bada kaarak he degree or atitaap kii avadhi

 When the body temperature reaches 40 centigrade or if the affected person has fainted and is indicating confusion, such hyperthermia is considered an emergency and requires treatment under appropriate medical care
 aspataal main ek or adhik aakraamak thanda karne ke upaay uplabdh hai, jisamen ant:shirabh jal-yojan, iced sline ke saath gastric leves or bhi rakt ko thanda karne ke liye hemodialysis shaamil hai
 The frequency of environmental hyperthermia varies significantly as it depends on the hot wave from year to year

 Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje or Shambhaji Maratha Emperor and successor of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj
 us samay marathaon ke sabase prabal shatru mughal badshaah aurangzeb bijapur or golkunda kaa shashan hindustan se samaapt karne main unki pramukh bhoomika rahi
 Sambhaji Raje was very famous for his bravery
 sambhaji maharaj ne apane kam samay ke shashan kaal main 140 yuddh kiye or isame ek pramukh baat ye thi ki unki sena ek bhi yuddh main parabhoot nahin hui
 Disturbed by his valor, Aurangzeb, the emperor of Delhi, vowed that unless Chhatrapati Sambhaji would be caught, he would not put his kimonsha on his head
 chhatrapati sambhaji nau varsh kii avasthaa main punyashlok chhatrapati shri chhatrapati shivaji maharaj kii prasiddh agra yatra main ve saath gayi the
 Departed from the detention house of Aurangzeb, Sambhaji was awarded the rank of king by the Mughal emperor and Panchajhari Mansab, as a result of the agreement with the Mughals, on the return of Punyashlok Chhatrapati Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to Maharashtra
 aurangabad kii mughal chhavnee main, maratha sena ke saath, uski niyukti hui 
 This job was not acceptable to him while being the son of the reigning king
 kintu hindai swarajya sthapana kii shuru ke din hone ke kaaran or pita punyashlok chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ke aadesh ke paalan hetu keval 9 saal ke umr main hi itnaa jimmedaari kaa lekin apmaan janak kaary unhone dhiraj se kiya
 He wrote the three Sanskrit texts Buddhabhushan, Nakhshikh, Nayikabheda and Sathataka in only 14 years of his age
 punyashlok chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ke rajbhishek or hindu swarajya ke baad sthapit ashtapradhan mantrimandal main se kuch logon kii raajkaaran ke vajah se yah samvedansheel yuvaraj kaaphi kshatigrast hue the
 Despite being mighty, he was kept away from many battles
 swabhaavat: samvedansheel rahanevaale sambhaji raaje unke pita shivaji maharaj ji ke ajna anusaar mughaalo ko ja mili taaki ve unhe gumraah kar sake
 Because at that time Maratha army had returned from Digvijay in the south direction and they needed time to get excited again
 isaliye mughaalo ko gumraah karane ke liye punyashlok chhatrapati shri shivaji maharaj ji ne hi unhe bhej tha vah ek rajtantr tha
 Later, Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj Ji freed him from the Mughals
 magar is prayaas main wo patni rani durgabai or bahen godavari unako apane saath len main asafal rahe
 After the death of Punyashlok Chhatrapati Shivaji Shri Maharaj, some people tried to thrice Anuj Rajaram of Dharmaveer student father Shri Sambhaji Maharaj
 kintu senapati mohite ke rahete yah karsthan naakaamayaab hua or 10 janvari 1681 ko sambhaji maharaj kaa vidhiwat rajbhishek hua
 In the same year, the rebellious son of Aurangzeb, Akbar, fled south and took shelter of Dharmaveer student Sambhaji Maharaj
 akele mogul, portuguese, angrez tathaa anya shatruon ke saath ladane ke saath hi unhen antargat shatruonse bhi ladanaa padaa
 Rajaram Samarthakone, who failed to make Rajaram as Chhatrapati, wrote a letter to Aurangzeb's son Akbar requesting him to invade the kingdom and mark it as the Mughal Empire
 kintu dharmaveer chhatrapati shri sambhaji maharaj ke parakram se parichit or unka ashrith hone ke kaaran akbar ne vah patr chhatrapati sambhaji ko bhej diya
 Enraged by this treason, Chhatrapati Srisambhaji Maharaj gave death sentence to his feudatories
 tathaapi un main se ek balaji aavji naamak samant kii samadhi bhi unhone banaayin jinke maafi kaa patr chhatrapati sambhaji ko un samant ke mrityu pashchaat mila
 In 1683 he defeated the Portuguese
 isi samay vah kisi rajkeey kaaran se sangameshwar main rahe the
 The day he was about to leave for Rayagada, on the same day some gramasthas wanted to accuse him of his problem
 jiske chalate chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ne apane saath keval 200 sainik rakh ke baaki sena ko raigarh bhej diya
 At the same time, one of his friends, whom he had refused to give, was sent by Mughal chieftain Mukarb Khan with an army of 5000 by secret route
 yah vah rasta tha jo sirf maraathon ko pataa tha
 Therefore Sambhaji Maharaj never felt that the enemy could come from this
 unhone ladane kaa prayaas kiya kintu itani badi fuj ke saamne 200 sainikon kaa pratikaar kaam kar na paaya or apane mitra tathaa ekmaatr salaahkaar kavikalash ke saath vah bandi bana liye gaye 
 Aurangzeb got the tongue of both of them, threw his eyes out
 11 march 1689 hindu navvarsh din ko donon ke sharir ke tukde kar ke aurangzeb ne hatya kar di
 But it is said that before the murder Aurangzeb told Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj that if one of my 4 sons was like you, then the whole of Hindustan would have been merged in the Mughal Sultanate
 jab chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke tukde tulapur kii nadi main phenken gaye to us kinare rahane vaale logon ne wo ikaitha kar ke sila ke jod die jis ke uparaant unka vidhipurvak antyasanskaar kiya
 Aurangzeb thought that the Marathi empire would end with the death of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj
 chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke hatya kii vajah se saare maratha ek saath aakar ladane lage
 Therefore Aurangzeb had to die in the Deccan itself
 uskaa dakkhan jeetne kaa sapana isi bhoomi main dafan ho gaya
 Despite being such a courageous and good ruler, due to less knowledge, his character is shown as a characterless and addictive king
 yah kaaphi achambhe kii baat he ke chhatrapati sambhaji maharaj ke bare main likhi gayi bate ye unke mrityu ke pashchaat 100 saal guzarane par likhi gayi, sambhaji maharaj or aurangzeb kaa sangharsh satta kaa sangharsh tha
 This sacrifice of Shri Sambhaji Maharaj, Dharmveer student, and the work of tormenting them, the Mughals kept on moving for a month at the behest of Aurangzeb and tortured them all the time and finally killed him by breaking his legs from neck to neck
 Before all this happened, Krurkarma and Dharmandha Aurang had asked them to renounce their Hindu religion and adopt the Muslim religion of the Mughals, but the son of the erstwhile Hindu king Chhatrapati Sri Shivajiraj and keep full devotion and devotion to his Hindu religion
 The decision to not accept Islam at all was told to Aurang
 In this anger, Aurangzeb had beaten him all over the entire month
 This whole month, Shree Shivpratisthan Hindusthan From the name of the organization, in the country of India, where the work of this organization is there, the devotion of this Dharmveer Chhatrapati Shri Sambhajirajen was completely followed
 Is God is sacrificing her It is said
 In which Shri Sambhaji Maharaj has a full month till his sacrifice at the time of holding, and this sacrificial month, which lasts for the entire month, in which all these people as a tribute to their favorite thing, for example drink tea, sweet
 Eating, shaving, not wearing slippers on the feet, eating only once a day, if you have an addiction, then abandon it, don't celebrate it, watch television
 They discard it
 And for the infinite benefaction of Dharamveer Shri Sambhaji Maharaj over the Hindu community, even the entire Hindu society also pleaded to observe this sacrificial month as a tribute to Shri Sambhaji Maharaj
 For example, drink tea, sweet food, shaving, do not wear slippers on the feet, eat only once a day, if you have an addiction, then abandon it, do not celebrate happiness, watch television
