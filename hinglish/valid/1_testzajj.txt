 The Latin for 'she is indebted' is 'debit' and the Latin for 'her is amanat hai' is 'credit'
 sampoorn dohari-pravishti vaali bahikhaata kaa aarambhik vidyaman sakshya 1299-1300 kaa ferolfi khaataa bahi hai
 Giovanno Farolfi & Co was a firm of important Florentine merchants with its head office in Nमेmes which also served as moneylender to the archbishop of Arles, his most important client
 sampoorn rup se dohari pravishti paddati kaa sabase puraane record kii khoj messari san 1340 ke genova shahar ke lekha ke rup main kii gayi he
 The bilateral format of debit and credit journal entry in Messari's accounts has been included and the surplus has been carried forward from the previous year and is therefore accepted as a common recognition of double entry
 luka pasioli kii "summaa de arethemetica, jeeyometria, proporshni at proporshaulita" sarvapratham venice main san 1494 main mudrit or prakashit kii gai thi
 It included a 27-page thesis on bookkeeping, "particularis de computis et scripturis"
 ise pehle vyapaariyon ke liye likhaa gaya tha or phir mukhya rup se unhen bech diya gaya tha, jo isamen nihit khushi ke strot ganitiya paheli kaa ek sandarbh pustak ke rup main or apane beton kii shiksha kii sahayika ke rup main bhi istemaal kiya karte the
 It represents the first known printed treatise on bookkeeping and is widely regarded as the precursor to modern bookkeeping practices
 summaa arethemetica main, pasioli ne pehali baar mudrit pustak main yoga or viyog ke liye pratikon kii shuruuaat kii, jo pratik italvi punarjagarankalin ganit main sanketan maanak bane
 summaa arethemetica italvi main chhapi bijganit nihit pehali pustak ke rup main gyaat he
 Although Luca Pacioli did not discover double-entry bookkeeping, he discussed it in a published 27-page bookkeeping dissertation on the subject, and it is said that he laid the foundation for double-entry bookkeeping that is practiced nowadays
 yadhyapi pasioli ke shodh-granth main moulikta lagbhag nahin ke baraabar he, phir bhi ise aam taur par ek mahatvapurn kaary mana jaataa he, vishesh rup se iske vyapak sanchalan ke kaaran, ise sthaneey italvi bhashaa main likhaa gaya or pustakaakaar main chapa gaya
 According to Pacioli, accounting is an ad hoc order system structured by the merchant
 iskaa niyamit istemaal vyapaaree ko uske vyapaar ke bare main niyamit jaankaree pradaan karata he or use yah moolyankan karne ke liye maukey detaa he ki baaten kaise banati hai or jiske anusaar kaary kiye jaay
 pasioli duusari sabhi paddatiyon se upar dohari pravishti vaali bahikhaata kii vinisian vidhi kii salaah dete hai
 There are three major books on the direct basis of this system: Memorial, Giornale and Quaderno
 The account is considered a central base and is accompanied by an alphabetical index
 pasioli ke shodhagranth main nirdesh diya gaya he ki vastu vinimay ke lenden or mudraon kii vibhinn kismon main lenden kaise record karen - aisa isliye sambhav tha kyonki aaj kii tulana main donon kahin adhik saamaanya the
 This enabled traders to conduct their own audits and to ensure that the entries were accurate or not in compliance with the method described in the records of the accounting done by the accountants
 Without such a system, all traders who did not maintain their own records were at greater risk of theft by their employees and agents: it is not accidental that the first and last items described in their research treatise were accurate
 Whether or not to list
 dohari pravishti kii prakruti kii pahchaan is baat se kii ja sakati he ki bahikhaata kii is pranali main ve kharide-beche gaye saamaanon kaa keval hisaab-kitaab hi nahin rakhte balki apane kaarobaar main parisampattiyon yaa laabh or haani kii gananaa bhi kar sakate he; iske bajaae dohari pravishti main lekhan ne, pratilekhan or gananaa ke prabhaav ko bhi peeche chhod diya
 iskaa ek saamaajik prabhaav vyapaariyon ko ek varg ke rup main apni eemaandaaree pramanit karnaa tha; iskaa ek gyanamimasiy prabhaav isaki aupchaarik shuddhta kaa nirmaan karnaa tha jo iske dwaara record kiye gaye vivaranon kii sateekta kii guarantee dene vaali ankaganitiya pratiti kii ek niyam bandha pranali par aadhaarit tha
 Although the information recorded in the accounts of the accounts was not necessarily accurate, the combination of precision and generalization effects in the dual entry system proves that the books of account were not only for the tendency to produce effects, but accurate accounts
 Were also for sankhya se pratishtha praapt karne ke bajaay, dohari pravishti bahikhaata ne sankhyaon ko saanskrithik adhikaar pradaan karne main madad bhi kii
 Italian accounting rules spread to the rest of Europe and even beyond, some of which were strongly based on Pacioli's work, the result of a research treatise that explained its functioning in detail
 Has gone
 domenico manjoni da oderjo kaa "quaderno dopiyo" pasioli kii "particularis de computis at scrypturis" kii pehali pratikrutiyon main se ek tha
 This work, valued by elaborate examples, was very popular and popular among merchants: it enjoyed no fewer than seven editions between 1534 and 1574
 pasioli kii rachana par pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup se aadhaarit anya pustaken hai: hew oldcastle kii "e profitbal tritis cold da instrument or bok tu larn tu no da good order of da femes riconing cold in latin, daire and habier, and in english, debitor and creditor", pasioli ke prabandh kaa ek anuwaad or woolfgang shwekar kii "jviftch buchhalton", "quaderno dopiyo" kaa ek anuwaad
 The Dutch mathematician Simon Stavin, in a chapter titled Coupmansbauckhauding op de Italian vices of his Wiskonstig Heidaktenisen, emphasized that traders make it a rule to summarize the account at the end of each year
 Although he prepared a balance sheet as per the requirement of every enterprise every year based on the book entries, it was prepared separately from the major books of accounts
 sabase purana ardh-saarvajanik balance shit dinaank 30 april 1671 ko darj kii gai thi jise east india company kii general meeting main 30 agast 1671 ko prastut kiya gaya tha
 The audit and publication of the balance sheet was a unique thing in England before the passage of the Bank Charter Act of 1844

 To explain why there was no cash to invest, the manager prepared a new financial statement called balance balance sheet, which showed that the company had a lot of inventory
 is nae vittiya vivaran ko nakad pravaah kathan patr kaa udgam mana jaataa he jiskaa prayog aajkal kiya jaataa he
 The publication of Pacioli's "particularis de Computies et Scripturis" and some other changes in accounting methods occurred during the 19th century
 There is a general theoretical consensus that the dual entry method was preferable as it can solve accounting problems
 lekin aam sahmati ke baavjood is lekhankan prathaon main ullekhneey bhinnataayen thi or 16 veen tathaa 17 veen sadiyon main vyapaariyon ne shaayad hi kabhi dohari pravishti paddati ke ucch maanakon kaa rakrakhaav karte the
 Dual entry bookkeeping is followed in different countries, industry and individual firms based on their audiences

 In the Ottoman Empire, when it was at the peak of its advancement, it used the Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa, the Balkans, and the eastern parts of Europe, the Mardiban accounting system adopted from the Ilkhanate in the 14th century for 500 years in the 19th
 This continued till the end of the century
 Both the Ilkhanians and the Automans used Siyakat, a style of writing in Arabic shorthand that was used only in writing government documents to prevent ordinary people from reading important correspondence of the state
 For each entry, the title is extended by moving the last letter of the first word in a straight line, so that the lines between successive entries are adorned in a ladder style
 In 1880, Sultan Abdulhamid II gave permission to the Ministry of Finance for double entry accounting with the Mardiban accounting system

 Therefore, one should fast with effort in it

 Vashistha Samhita has the opinion - If the sum of both Ashtami and Rohini is incompatible in Ahoratra, then fasting should be done only in the time of Muhurta as well

 The Maurya dynasty was a powerful and great dynasty of ancient India descended from the Shakya dynasty
 isane 137 varsh bharat main rajya kiya
 Its establishment is credited to Chandragupta Maurya and his minister Kautilya, who defeated Emperor Ghanananda of the Nanda dynasty, who was the brother of Chandragupta Maurya
 maury samrajya ke vistaar evam use shaktishaalee banane kaa shrey samraat ashok ko jaataa he
 This empire started in the Magadha kingdom in the east from the plains of the river Ganges
 isaki rajdhani patliputra thi
 Chandragupta Maurya founded this empire in 322 BC and rapidly developed his empire towards the west
 usne kai chote chote kshetreey rajyon ke aapasi matbhedon kaa phayda uthaaya jo sikandar ke akraman ke baad paidaa ho gayi the
 By 316 BCE, the Maurya dynasty had captured the whole of North Western India

 It was due to Emperor Ashoka that the Maurya Empire became the most famous and powerful worldwide

 But it also does not fit well
 For the first time in Indian history, the name of the mother was the son's descendant; Maurya was a powerful dynasty
 He inherited from his father
 The son's name is associated with the father, his origin is from the Vrishala dynasty
 It was done, but no proof of this is available in history, this is the only argument that no one in history has named her dynasty after mother's name, so some historians This is just conjecture
 
 Chandragupta was the son of the same Gana chief who was killed as a warrior in his childhood
 chandragupta main raja banane ke swaabhaavik gun the 'isi yogyata ko dekhte hue chanakya ne use apana shishy bana liya, evam ek sabal raashtra kii niv daali jo kii aaj tak ek adarsh he
 This was followed by a web of spies spread across India to collect secret information against the king as traitors - this was perhaps unprecedented in India
 ek baar aisa ho jane ke baad usne chandragupta ko unani kshatrapon ko maar bhagane ke liye taiyaar kiya
 In this task he was helped by a wide network of detectives
 magadh ke akraman main chanakya ne magadh main grihayuddh ko uksaaya
 His detectives bribed Nanda's officers and made him in his favor
 iske baad nand shaasha ne apana pad chhod diya or chanakya ko vijayshri praapt hui
 Nanda had to lead an exile life after which what happened to him is unknown
 chandragupta maury ne janata kaa vishwaas bhi jeeta or iske saath usko satta kaa adhikaar bhi mila
 At that time, Magadha was the most powerful state in India

 Chandragupta started his conquest of western and southern India

 The Junagadh inscription of Rudradaman states that a dam on the Sudarshan Lake was built by Pushyagupta for irrigation
 pushyagupt us samay ashok kaa prantiy rajyapal tha
 After liberating northwest India from Greek rule, its focus shifted to the south
 chandragupta ne sikandar ke senapati celukas ko 305 isapurv ke aasapaas haraaya tha
 The Greek accounts do not refer to this conquest, but this much says that a treaty was signed between Chandragupta and Seleucus according to which Seleucus gave the territories of Kandahar, Kabul, Herat and Baluchistan to Chandragupta
 iske saath hi chandragupta ne use 500 hathi bhent kiye the
 It is also said that Chandragupta established a matrimonial relationship with Seleucus' daughter
 celukas ne megasthaneez ko chandragupta ke darbar main rajdoot ke rup main bheja tha
 According to Plutarch, "sandrocottus had ascended the throne by that time, he had trampled and subjugated the whole of India with his army of 6,00,000 soldiers"

 Since there is no information that Ashoka or his father Bindusar had fought any war in the south and conquered it, it is believed that Chandragupta had conquered them
