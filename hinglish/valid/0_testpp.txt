 Leif Eriksson
}} Was an Icelandic explorer
 mana jaataa he ki leef aise pehle europee the jinhone uttari america par kadam rakhaa, christopher kolmbus se 500 varsh pehle
 According to the "sagas of Icelanders", they established a colony in Vineland, today known as Lons o Meadow in the island of Neufoundland
 mana jaataa he ki leef kaa janm aisland me hua tha, lagbhag san 970 main
 He was the son of father Eric the Red and mother Thyotkhild
 erik da red swan ek anveshak the or unhone greenland me pratham norvezian upnivesh kii sthapana kii thi
 Leaf had two sons, Thorgils and Thorkel
 leef pita erik da red or mata theotakhild ke putr or thorwald asawaldsan ke pautra the
 Although the birthplace of Leaf is not given in Sagas of Icelanders, Leaf was probably born in Bravafurthur, Iceland
 leef ke do bhai, thorsten or thorwald or ek bahan, fredis, the
 Thorvald Aswaldsson was deported from Norwe to assassination, and went into exile with the young Eric to Iceland
 jab erik swan hi island se nirvasit hue, unhone pashchim ki ore yatra kii or san 986greenland me pratham norwagian upnivesh kii sthapana kii
 In May 1999, Leif and his colleagues sailed from Greenland to Norway
 norve pahuchane par ve raja olaaf trigvaasan ke hardman ban gayi
 He embraced Christianity and was entrusted with the task of expanding this religion in Greenland
 "sagas off erik da red" or "sagas off greenlanders" main leef kii vinland kii yatra ke prati bhinn vivaran diye gayi hai
 Vineland has been discussed in only two historical writings, the book by Ari de Wies in 1122, Iselindinkabok, and Adam of Bremen
 "sagas off greenlanders" ke anusaar, leef ne vinland ko pehali baar tab dekha tha jab ve greenland se norve isai dharm kaa vistaar karne ja rahe the or apni yatra me bhatak gayi
 According to Einar Haughan's literal interpretation of the translation of "voyages to Vineland", Leif Erikson was not the first to have seen North America
 leef ne byarni harjolfasan ke daawey sune the ki usne greenland ke pashchim bhi ek bhoomi dekhi thi
 However, Byrne reportedly never stepped on North America
 baad me, jab leef norve se greenland kii yatra kar rahe the, ve rasta bhatak kar uttari america ke ek dweep me pahuch gayi jahaan par unhe "apane-aap uge hue gehun ke or angoor ke khet" dikhe
 He rescued two unknown persons from that island and went back to Greenland
 parinamswaroop, agar is par bharosa kiya jaay, to byarni uttari america ko dekhne vaale pehle europea the or ve do agyaat log us mahadweep par kadam rakhane vaale pehle europea the
 Leif then bought a ship of birney, assembled a crew of 35 sailors and headed to the land described by biryani
 arikson ne byarni ke path kaa uttkram me anugaman kiya or ek nirjan patharilii jagah par pahuch gayi, jiskaa naam unhone heluland rakhaa
 After a short journey, he reached a forested area, which he named Markland
 antat, leef vinland pahuch gayi
 Here he established a small colony, which the visitors of Greenland gave the name of Lefsbudir
 vinland me sardiyaan bitaa kar ve waapas greenland aa gayi
 In May 1960, research by the Norwegian explorer Helg Eggstadt led to the discovery of a Norwegian colony on the northern coast of Neufoundland
 mana gaya he ki yah jagah, jise aaj launs o medo ke naam se janaa jaataa he, "voyajes tu vinland" or anya pustakon me varnit lifsbudir he
 Egstadt showed that Norwegians and Icelandic people arrived in North America 500 years before Chrysotofer Columbus
 baad ke puratathvik sakshya se pataa chalata he ki vinland saint laurence kii khadi ke aasapaas kshetron me sthit tha or launs o medo ek jahaaj marammat-sthal or anya yatraaon ke liye vishram-sthal tha
 Two more places are mentioned in Sagas of Eric the Red - Stromford and Hope
 dono hi vinland ke dakshin me sthit hai
 Leaf is said to be a powerful, knowledgeable, and thoughtful person
 jab leef habrides me ruke hue the, unhone thoraguna ke sang vivaah kiya, jisane leef ke putr thurgills ko janm diya
 Thorgils was later sent to Greenland near the Leaf, but was not able to achieve fame
 vinland kii yatra ke baad, leef waapas greenland aa kar isaai dharm kaa vistaar karne lag gayi
 Eric did not adopt the Christian religion, but Theotkhild adopted this religion and established the "theotkhild Church"
 lif kaa aakhri jivit ullekh san 1019 me hua he or san 1025 me leef ke bete thorakel ko iricayord kaa sardaar bana diya gaya
 Leaf's death is not mentioned in the serials - he died between 1019 and 1025
 lif ke safal abhiyaan ke pashchaat anya norwagian anveshak bhi yatra karne ke liye protsaahit hue
 The first explicit contact between the Norse and indigenous peoples of North America was by Leif's brother Thorwald, which ended in murder and enmity
 antat: vinland me koi sthaayee upnivesh kii sthapana nahi hui, parantu lakdi, praavdhaanon or vyapaar ke liye sadiyon tak abhiyaan chalate rahe
 Incidental tones about these areas suggest that contemporaries did not give much importance to these campaigns, or that it was public knowledge
 in abhiyaanon kaa gyaan sambhavatya madhyakaalin europe me fail gaya or yah bhi sambhav he ki christopher kolmbus ne in abhiyaanon ke bare me suna ho
 For Leif's travel stories, the Nordic Americans had a profound impact on their self-perceptions
 The first leaf sculpture in America was built in Boston in 1887
 chicago me 1901 ek or murti nirmaanit hui
 The date 9 October has been used in the United States to recall the Leaf
 1929 main, visconsin vidhanmandal rajya main oktober 9 "leif Erikson diwas" banane ke liye ek bill paarit kiya

 For the next few years, the Parthians remained in the hands of the government, but their leadership and their grip on all Iranian territories remained loose

 After this, the power of Persia was not dominated by a single ruler
 haalaanki romanon ne dazala nadi ke purv kabhi bhi apana prabhaav nahin badhaayaa par farsi shaasha romanon ke mukaable dabe hi rahe
 But from the third century onwards, Sasani power increased steadily

 unke vaaris yazdegard ne romanon ke saath shanti banaae rakhaa
 Relations with the Romans became so peaceful during his reign that Archadius, the ruler of the Eastern Roman Empire, made Yazgardard the guardian of his son
 uske baad baharam pancham shaasha bana jo junglee jaanwaron ke shikaar kaa shaukeen tha
 He went missing while watching a wild game around 438 AD, after which nothing could be known about him

 After this came the rule of Khusrau, Hormuzd IV, Khusrau II and Yazgard III
 jab yazdegard ne satta samhaali tab wo keval 8 saal kaa tha
 At this time the Arabs became quite powerful under the leadership of Muhammad
 san 634 main unhone gaza ke nikat begentinon ko ek nirnaayak yuddh main haraa diya
 They also attacked the Persian Empire, but they were not as successful
 san 641 main unhone hamaadaan ke nikat yazdegard ko haraa diya jiske baad wo purab kii taraf sahaayta yachana ke liye bhaaga par uski mrityu marv main san 651 main uske hi logon dwaara hui
 After that the dominance of the Arabs grew
 unhone 654 main khorasaan par adhikaar kar liya or 707 isvi tak balkh
 After Muhammad's death, his heir was called Khalifa, who was considered the head of Islam
 chauthe khalipha ali, mohammad sahab ke farik the or unki putree fatima ke pati
 But his Khilafat was challenged and rebellions also occurred
 san 661 main ali kii hatya kar di gai
 After this, the Umayyads dominated Islam
 san 680 main kerbala main ali ke duusare putr hossain ne ummayadon ke khilaaf baghawat kii par unako ek yuddh main maar diya gaya
 Shia Muslims celebrate Mahurram in memory of this day
 is samay tak islam do kheme main bat gaya tha - ummayadon kaa khemaa |or ali kaa khemaa
 Those who considered the Umayyads to be the real heirs of Islam were called Sunnis and those who considered Ali as the true Caliph were Shia
 In 740, the Ummayad had to face the Turks
 usee saal ek farsi parivartit - abu muslim - ne ummayadon ke khilaaf mohammad sahab ke vansh ke naam par ummayadon ke khilaaf ek bada janamanas taiyaar kiya
 He defeated the Ummayads between 749–50 and declared a new caliph - Abul Abbas
 abul abbaas ali or hossain kaa vanshaj to nahin par mohammad sahab ke ek or farik kaa vanshaj tha
 It did not see the increasing popularity of Abu Muslim and hanged him in 755 AD
 is ghatana ko shiya islam main ek mahatvapurn din mana jaataa he kyonki ek baar phir ali ke samarthakon ko haashiye par laa khadaa kiya gaya tha
 The descendants of Abul Abbas ruled for many centuries
 uskaa vansh abbasi vansh kahalaaya or unhone apni rajdhani baghdad main sthapit kii
 His rule was made by incorporating the influence of the Arab and West Asian army and Persian literature
 arabi bhashaa main vigyaan, chikitsa tathaa jyotish ke kai avismaraneey yogadan iraniyon ne mukhyatah arabi bhashaa main kiya
 In the tenth century, the sowing rulers of Iranian origin in West Asia invaded and defeated Baghdad, thus putting an end to the superiority of the Abbasid Khilafat
 san 920 main uttar-purvi faras ke koraasaan main samaani samrajya kaa udai hua
 The common rulers made efforts to develop the Persian language
 islam ke aagaman ke baad yah pehla mauka tha jab kisi shaasha ne irani bhashaa ke vikaas ke protsaahan diye
 The Saljuq Turks from the north and the Ghaznavi rulers from the northeast partially controlled Iran for some time
 terahavi sadi main us samay amuslim rahe mongolon ke akraman ke baad baghdad kaa patan ho gaya or iran main phir se kuch saalon ke liye rajnatik araajaktaa chai rahi
 After one and a half years, Timur Lang was also attacked in Iran
 is dauraan kavita or sufi vichaardhaara kaa bahut vikaas hua
 One of the major events in Iran during the Abbasid period was the development of the Sufi movement
 yadhyapi sufi andolan to arab or iraq ke ilaake main janma tha par usko sampoorn rup iran main hi mila
 Sufis were those who were victims of religious fanaticism and preferred a simple life
 is kaal ne farsi bhashaa main abhootpurv kaviyon ko janm diya
 Rudaki, Firdausi, Umar Khayyam, nasir-e-khusro, Rumi, Iraqi, Saadi, Hafiz, etc
 became famous poets of that period in which many are known as the pioneers of Sufism
 is kaal kii farsi kavita ko kai jagahon par vishwa kaa sabase behtareen kavy kaha gaya he
 Rudaki and Firdausi got the benefit of the Persian literature of the common and Ghaznavi rulers of Khorasan in the northeast
 firdausi ke shahname ko islam-purv iran ke shaskaon ko mahimamandit karne kii pustak ke rup main janaa jaataa he jisane us kaal kii bolchaal kii farsi main samahit ho chuke arabi shabdon kaa prayog kam kiya
 Later poets, however, did not avoid Arabic words, and by the thirteenth century Arabic words became part of Persian
 rumi, iraqi tathaa saadi 1210 ke dashak main paidaa hue the or haafiz unke ek sadi baad
 Even today, Iranians have great respect for poets during this period
 inamen se kai kavi sufi vichaardaara se otprot the or abbasi shashan ke alaava kaiyon ko mongolon kaa julm bhi sahanaa yaa dekhnaa padaa tha
 Persia was troubled by the invasion of Timur Lung during Hafiz
 pandrahavin sadi main jab mongolon kii shakti ksheen hone lagi tab iran ke uttar pashchim main turk ghudsavaaron se lash ek sena kaa udai hua
 There is a difference of opinion about its origins, but they established the Safavid dynasty
 ve shiya ban gaye or aane vaali kai sadiyon tak unhone irani bhubhag or faras ke prabhutv vaale ilaakon par raaj kiya
 At this time, Shia Islam flourished
 1720 ke afgaan or purvi vidrohon ke baad dhire-dhire safaviyon kaa patan ho gaya
 The Afghans captured the Safawi capital, Isfahan and imprisoned Shah Abbas and his son Tahmasya
 tahmaasya bhaag nikalne main to safal rahaa par isiahaan par afagaanon kaa niyantran bana rahaa
 In 1729, Nadir Koli reduced the dominance of the Afghans
 usne apana jivan vipannataa se aarambh kiya tha or faras kaa shah hi na bana balki usne us samay irani samrajya ke sabal shatru osmani samrajya or roosi samrajya ko irani kshetron se baahar nikaala
 He was an Turk but he helped the Safavis against the invading Ottoman Turks from the west
 isse vah avsaanpraay safaviyon kii sena main ucch sthaan paa sakaa
 Nadir Koli, who considered Timur Lung as his idol, belonged to the Afshari Kabale and his life is known for his military achievements
 saafvi shah tahmaasya ne afagaanon ko sathvi rajdhani isiahaan se bhagane ke evaj main nadir ko kuli tapamasya kii oopaadhi di thi jiske baad wo safavi darbar main ek sammanit vyakti ban gaya
 After this, he pacified the Afghans and Usmanas and also invaded India
 mongol shah alam ko parajeet karke vahaan se koi 70 karod rupayon ke baraabar smapda lekar aayaa jisamen kohinoor hira bhi shaamil tha
 Apart from this, he also created a fierce attack
 us samay ke urdu shaayar mir taqi mir ne akraman ke pehle tathaa baad dilli kaa varnan kiya jisamen pataa chalata he ki nadir coli ne dilli main kitni tabaahi machaai thi
 On his return from India, he learns that his son Raza Koli, whom he had entrusted with the task of overseeing the empire in his absence, has assassinated Shah Tahmasya, who was on the throne of Persia
 us samay tak nadir coli shah nahin bana tha balki farsi samrajya kaa senapati tha
 He became Shah in 1736
 iske baad wo dagestan ke vidroh ko kuchalane gaya jahaan mili asafalataa use sataane lagi
 Also, when he got information from some warlords that Raza was plotting to kill him too, he blinded Raza
 baad main use jab pataa chalaa ki raza nirdosh he to use bahut glani hui or un saradaaron par gussa aayaa jinhone use andhaa karavaaya tha
 He gave orders to kill them but still he got very angry on himself and his nature started to change
 wo atyaachaari or krur banataa gaya saath hi kamazor or biimaar bhi ho chalaa tha
 Against the Osman in the West, he could not be more successful, and in an agreement made in 1746, he had to be satisfied very closely
 san 1747 main uski hatya kar di gai
 After he died, his empire could not last long
 par wo us samay kii kathin paristhitiyon main samrajya ko avibhajit rakhane ke liye yaad kiya jaataa he
 a few days later the rule of the Qajar dynasty came but at that time the influence of the Russian, British and French empires increased due to the discovery of Iran's oil fields and its location between Osmani, Indian and Russian territories
 uttar se rus, pashchim se france tathaa purab se britain kii nigahen faras par pad gayi
 In 1905–1911, there was a mass movement against increased European influence and the inaction of the Shah
 iraan ke tel kshetron ko lekar tanaav bana rahaa
 Iran also suffered after Turkey was defeated in the First World War
 kaha jaataa he dwitiya vishwayuddh ke dauraan german naziyon kii upasthiti kii ashanka ko dekhte hue britain or rus se janata ke paroksh rup se iran kii satta par adhikaar bana liya tha, lekin kaagazi rup se aisa kuch nahin hua
 Raza Shah began modernizing Iran in the 1930s
 par wo apane preranstrot turki ke kamaal pasha kii tarah safal nahin rah sakaa
 He made unprecedented arrangements for education and strengthened the army
 usne turki ke kamaal pasha kii tarah desh ke kaaryon main dharm kaa prabhaav kam kiya
 Protestant Islamists were sentenced to jail or expelled
 ayatollah khumaini isi ke tahat pehle iraq, phir istambul or uske baad paris main rahe
 Then in 1979, there was another movement which was religious
 iske falswaroop pahalavi vansh kaa patan ho gaya or ayatolla khomeni ko satta mili
 He died in 1989
 unke shashan kaal main hi islamic prabhaav ke tahat unhen lekhak salmaan rushdi ke kilaaf fatwa jari karnaa padaa
 Since then, foreign domination in Iran has almost ended
 abhi iran main sakht islamic niyam lagu hai or mahilaon ko hizaab pahanane kii vivashtaa he
 Although life is full of luxury in cities due to the money coming from oil, but within strict limits of Islamic law

 Many countries including the US have started imposing economic sanctions and Israel is threatening military action
 media pakshpaat se taatpary patrakaron evam samachar utpaadakon dwaara tarah-tarah se kiye jane vaale pakshpaat se he
 Media bias may be in the form of election of events and stories to be reported or may also be in the form of presentation
 media-adhyayan ke vidwaanon kii manyata he ki maas-media kaa avadharanatmak udgam propaganda he
 In the sixteenth century, Jesuit followers of Catholicism launched an anti-reform ideological campaign in response to criticism from Protestants based on what the Latin word 'propaganda' meant
 iske peeche samaj yah thi ki log tab tak koi sandesh aatmsaat nahin karte jab tak vah unhen baar-baar na diya jaae
 The process of messaging changed under the circumstances created after the European Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, as it became increasingly necessary to take care of the interests of voters, consumers and audiences
 aadhunik rajya ne videshi akraman kii apvadswarup paristhitiyon main thopi gayi sensorship ko chhod kar aam nagarikon ko shikshit-prashikshit karne kii praathamikta apanaayi
 The self-proclaimed neutrality of the media worked here in the state
 sarkari mashinari ke bajaay ek rashtriya sahmati bana kar media ko raashtra or rajya-nirmaan kii pariyojna main laga kar sarkaron or rashtriya abhijanon ne bahut badi kamyaabi hasil kii
 Since mass media can produce mass publicity content through entertainment, news, analytics, advertising, and interactive discussions, the corporate world, the nation-state, and the world can exploit its propaganda-related capabilities in the twentieth century
 Advocates of political ideologies have developed open and hidden tricks
 media kii taraf se vyaavhaarikta kii daleel di jaati he ki sabhi tathyon or ghatnaon kii rapat prasaarit nahin kii ja sakati, isliye unamem se kuch ko chunanaa or kuch ko chhodana hi padataa he
 This process of selection and sorting only creates favoritism and helps in building pre-determined consent
 vigyapakon ko kush karne ke liye, media-maalikon ke hiton ko saadhane ke liye, bahusnkhyakon yaa alpsankhyakon kii kathith bhaawanaaon ko thes na lagane dene ke naam par or raashtra-rajya kii pradhan vichaardhaara ko pusht karne ke liye chuninda tathyon par jor diya jaataa he
 The religious, racial, sexual, age-related, sexist, casteist and ethnicist dimensions of media-bias are also outlined
 sabhi log jaanate hai ki media pakshpaat karata he, par uske is ravaiye ko chihnit karnaa or uski vistrut aalochana karnaa ek mushkil kaam he
 In response to accusations of bias, media advocates often ask whether it is fair journalism to present a statement made by the two parties in their own right by a reporter going to report an incident
 These people say that 'balanced' reporting means spineless and edgeless journalism
 zaahir he ki yah tark tatasthta ko betuka maanate hue ‘pakshadharata’ or ‘patibaddhta’ ko ‘pakshpaat’ nahin maanata
 If the media is not trying to hide its favoritism, its unilateralism can be assumed as its quality
 lekin, agar tatasthta kii aad main ek khaas tarah kii sahmati gadhane kii koshish kii ja rahi he to uskaa pataa lagane or phir use zaahir karne ke liye vistrut adhyayan kii zarurat padati he
 According to a 2004 study, twelve methods can be used to spot media-bias: the political / cultural attitudes of journalists, media-elites and journalism students can be surveyed; Old professional contacts with journalists can be traced; Quotes inaugurating the political beliefs of prominent journalists can be submitted; The use of keywords can be done by using the computer to find out the essence and range of media content; The policies suggested by news stories can be studied; Negative / positive coverage of an event can be underlined; The career of those in the media can be looked at with decision-making powers in their hands; Information / entertainment-advertising-influencing sources can be studied; The impact of the government propaganda and public relations industry on the media can be noted, experts and spokespersons selected for commentary by the media can be seen against the interest groups and ideology advocates who are not the media Chooses; And the payments made in lieu of the speeches made by the corporations and commerce associations to journalists, etc
 can be looked at
 media kii pakshadharata kaa vishleshan karne ke maamle main glassgo media group kaa adhyayan kaafii charchit hua he jisamen yah pataa lagane kii koshish kii gayi thi ki tivi or akhbaar mazdoor andolan ke kilaaf kis tarah corporate hiton kii seva karte hai
 This study has also been accused of bias in that the expressions used by the media about the workers as derogatory are derived from the self-described narration by the workers
 media or propegande ke bich spasht sambandh sthapit karne vaala ek vikhyath adhyayan nom chomski ke prayaason kaa parinaam he jisamen dikhaaya gaya he ki swatantra media kii saakh ko thes pahunchaane ke liye america kii corporate shaktiyaan kis tarah ‘communist virdohi vichaardhaara’ ke filtaron kaa istemaal karti hai
 On the other hand, studies on the media of developed countries have shown that it generally favors liberal ideology over conservatism
 1986 main media-abhijanon par hue ek adhyayan se yah hakeekat saamne aayi thi ki neuyork times or washington post jaise bade akhbaaron or prasaaran networkon ke newzarumon main baayen baazuu ke udaarataavaadi rujhaanon kaa bolbalaa rahata he
 The attitude that journalists and analysts generally take regarding social and political disputes has a deep imprint on their personal views
 media-pakshpaat or bhartiya media kaa sameekaran pashchim jaisaa nahin rahaa he
 Before independence, the entire Indian media was divided into two poles
 angrezi ke sabhi bade akhbaar khul kar aupniveshik shashan kaa samarthan karte the or bhartiya bhashaaon kaa media bina kisi apwaad ke rashtriya andolan ke paksh main khadaa hua tha
 This can be seen as an example of the difference between 'favoritism' and 'partiality'
 1947 main pandrah agast ko satta-hastantaran hote hi angrezi media raaton-raat rashtriya media main badal gaya
 After this, by the late eighties, all aspects of the media contributed in their own way to the national consensus to pave the way for India's socio-political modernization and the model of mixed economies based on developmental economics
 nabbe ke dashak main mandir, mandal or bazaar kii udiyaman takaton ke ird-gird bhartiya raajnneeti or samaaj main naye dhruvikaran hue jinhone us rashtriya sahmati ko bhang kar diya
 Different sections of the media, sometimes adopting an attitude of favoritism and partiality, began to support and oppose these powers from time to time
 aaj sthiti yah he ki bhartiya media lagbhag bina kisi apwaad ke aarthik sudhaaron or bhoomandaleekaran kaa paksh le rahaa he
 The media has accepted this as a new national consensus

 Kanishka I), or Kanishka the Great, was one of the greatest emperors of India of the Kushan dynasty in the second century
 vah apane sainya, rajnatik evam aadhyatmik uplabdhiyon tathaa kaushal hetu prakhyat tha
 This emperor has a special place in Indian history and history of Central Asia, being a lover of his conquests, religious tendencies, literature and art
 kushaan vansh ke sansthaapak kujul kadfices kaa hi ek vanshaj, kanishka bakhtriya se is samrajya par sattarum hua, jisaki gananaa asia ke mahanatam shaskaon main kii jaati he, kyonki iskaa samrajya tareem basin main turfan se lekar gangey maidan main patliputra tak rahaa tha jisamen madhya asia ke aadhunik uzbekistan tazakastan, china ke aadhunik sikyang evam consu praant se lekar afghanistan, pakistan or samast uttar bharat main bihar evam urisa tak aate hai
 The main capital of this empire was in the city of Purushapur in Peshawar Gandhar province
 iske alaava do anya badi rajdhaniyaan pracheen kapisha main bhi thim
 His triumphs and faith in Buddhism played a special role in the development of the silk route and the expansion of Mahayana Buddhism from Gandhara through that stretch across the Karakoram ranges to China
 pehle ke itihaasavettaon ke anusaar kanishka ne rajgaddi 78 i0 main praapt kii, evam tabhi is varsh ko shaq sanwat ke armbh kii tithi mana jaataa he
 However, according to later historians, this date is no longer considered the date of Kanishka's ruling
 inke anumananusaar kanishka ne satta 127 i0 main praapt kii thi
 Kanishka was a Kushan of the Yuzhi race
 uski sthaneey bhashaa abhi agyaat he
 In his Rabatak inscriptions, the Greek script has been used to write a language called Arya, which is a form of Bakhtri, the original language of Ariana
 yah ek madhyakaalin purvi iranian bhashaa thi
 By the way, this language must have been used by the Kushans to contact the local people
 kushaan logon ke kuleen log kis bhashaa vishesh kaa prayog karte the, ye abhi nishchit nahin he
 If the controversial things linking the Kushan and / or Yuezhi peoples with the Agni Kuchi people of the Tarim Basin were correct, then the language of the Torcherians - a Chantom indo-european language - would have been spoken by Kanishka
 kanishka vim kadfices kaa uttaradhikari tha, jaisaa rabatak shilalekhon main kushaan raajaaon kii prabhaavshaalee vanshavali dwaara drishy he
 The relationship of Kanishka to other Kushan kings is mentioned in the Rabatak inscriptions, from which the lineage up to the time of Kanishka is known
 uske prapitamah kujul kadfices the, vimaa taktu uske pitamah the
 Kanishka's father was Vim Kadphises, who later came to Kanishka himself
 kanishka kaa samrajya nissandeh vishaal tha
 It extended from southern Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to the north of Amu Darya, located in the northwest direction from Pakistan and India to Mathura in the southeast
 rabatak shilalekhon ke anusaar yah patliputra evam shrichampa tak vistrut tha
 Kashmir in north India was also under Kanishka, where a town called Kanishka was settled near Baramulla Pass
 yahan se ek bahut bade stupa kaa aadhaar praapt hua he
 Knowledge of Kanishka's dominance over Central Asia is still limited
 book of da letters haan, hau hanshu, se gyaat hota he ki, chini general baan chaao ne 90 i main khotaan ke nikat kanishka kii 70,000 sainikon kii sena se yuddh kiya, jiskaa netritva kushan senadhipati zai ne kiya tha
 Although Ban Chao claimed to be victorious and at the same time repelled the army of the Kushans under the Scorched Earth Policy, the region remained under the Kushans by the beginning of the second century
 parinamswaroop, yah kshetra kushanon kaa samrajya kuch samay ke liye kashgaar, khotaan evam yaarakanda tak bhi vistrut hua, jo ki pehle tareem basin ke chini kshetra rahe the
 Many coins from the time of Kanishka have been found in the Tarim Basin
 dakshin asia evam rome ke bich bhoomi path tathaa samudri maarg, donon par hi adhikaar banaaye rakhana, kanishka kaa mukhya lakshya rahaa tha
 Kanishka's postures bear the markings of the Indian Hindu, Greek, Iranian and Sumerian goddesses, indicating his religious tolerance
 uske dwaara shashan ke aarmabhik varshon main chalaaye gaye sikkon main unani lipi va bhashaa kaa prayog hua he tathaa unani daivi chitra ankit mili
 Later period coins show Iranian gods in Bactrian, Iranian script and languages, which he used to speak, and Greek gods
 sabhi kanishka ke sikkon main, yaham tak ki un sikkon main bhi jo bactrian main likhe hai, ek sanshodhit unani lipi main likhe gayi the, jinamein ek atirikt utkeern akshar he, jo 'kushaaan' evam 'kanishak' main prayukt / š / darshata he
 In the coin of Emperor Kanishka, Suryadeva stands to the left

 The sword hangs around the waist

 He wears large circular shoes
 use praayah vedi par aahuti yaa bali dete hue dikhaaya jaataa he
 a statue of Kanishka matching this description was preserved in the Kabul Museum, but was later destroyed by the Taliban
 kanishka ke kaal ke armbh ke kuch sikkon par unani bhashaa evam lipi main likhaa he : ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΚΑΝΗϷΚΟΥ, basalius baseleon kaneshkou "kanishka ke sikke, raajaaon kaa raja" in aarmabhik mudraon main unani naam likhe jate the: Along with the arrival of the Bactrian language on the currencies, the Iranian and Indic gods took the place of the Greek gods on them: bahut kam kintu kuch buddha devataaon kaa ankan kiya gaya: Apart from these, some Hindu deities are also marked: kanishka buddha dharm main atyant mahatvapurn sthaan par pratishthit he, kyonki vah na keval buddha dharm main vishwaas rakhata tha varan uski shikshaaon ke prachaar evam prasar ko bhi bahut protsaahan diya
 An example of this is that he organized the fourth Buddhist organization in Kashmir, which was presided over by Vasumitra and Ashwaghosh
 isi parishad main buddha dharm do maton main vibhajit ho gayi – hinayan evam mahayan
 At the same time, a picture of Buddha with 22 physical symbols was also made

 kushaan samrajya kii vibhinn pustako me varnit buddha shikshaaon evam prarthana style ke madhyam se kanishka ke buddha dharm ke prati jhukaav kaa pataa chalata he
 Kanishka's greatest contribution to Buddhist architecture was the Buddhist stupa of Peshawar
 jin puraatatvavettaon ne iske aadhaar ko 1908-1909 main khoja, unhone bataaya ki is stupa kaa vyas 286 fit tha
 Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang has written that the height of this stupa was 600 to 700 "feet" and it was studded with precious gems

 a hair piece is also built on his crest
 aisa gandhar ke baad ke bahut se shilpon main dekhne ko miltaa he
 Thus one can say that his form is highly symbolized in the Buddha coins, which is different from the earlier Gandhara sculptures

 His mustache has also been shown in many postures
 inke daaen haath kii hatheli par chakra kaa chihn he evam bhavon ke bich urn chihn hota he

 is par samraat kanishka ke saath surya evam chandra ke chitra kaa ankan hua he
 The first year of the Samvat of Saka Samvatsara, run by Kanishka, is inscribed on this ark

 It is said that the present day residents of Bhinmal, Deora / Deora people and Shrimali Brahmins came from Kanak as well as from Kashmir
 devda / devra, logon kaa yah naam isliye padaa kyonki unhone jagaswami surya mandir banaaya tha
 Being associated with King Kanaka, it would not be wrong to associate him with the title Devaputra of Emperor Kanishka

 Mimamsutra is one of the most important texts of Indian philosophy
 iske rachayita maharishi jaimini hai
 It is also known as Purimansutra
 iskaa rachanakaal 300 isapurv se 200 isapurv mana jaataa he
 Mimamsutra is the basic text of Mimamsa philosophy
 pramparanusaar rishi jaimini ko maharishi veda vyas kaa shishy mana jaataa he
 Mimamsasutra is also called 'purva Mimamsa' and Vedanta's 'uttara Mimamsa'
 purmamimasaa main dharm kaa vichaar he ar uttarmimasaa main brahm kaa
 Therefore, the Dharmamimamsa of the East and the North, and the north-east is also called the Brahmanimansa
 jaimini muni dwaara rachit sutara hane se mimasaa kaa 'jaimineey dharmamimasaa' kaha jaataa he
 The Yajnaic utterances of the Vedas have been interpreted with great thought in the foregoing
 mimasaa shaastra main yagyon kaa vistrut vivechan he, isse ise 'yajnvidya' bhi kehete hai 
 Being divided into twelve chapters, this epistemology is also called 'dwadashalshi'
 is shaastra kaa 'purvamimasaa' naam is abhipraay se nahin rakhaa gaya he ki yah uttarmimasaa se pehle bana
 To say 'east' means that ritual is the first religion of man, the right to knowledge comes after him
 'mimasaa' shabd kaa arth 'jigyaasa' he
 Curiosity, meaning the longing to know
 manushya jab is sansar main avatarit hua uski pratham jigyaasa yahi rahi thi ki vah kya kare? granth kaa armbh hi mahirsh jaimini is prakaar karte hai- Therefore, the first formula of this philosophy is a symbol of this desire of man
 is granth main gyaan-uplabdhi ke jin chah sadhano kii charchaa kii gai he, ve he- pratyaksh, anumaan, upmaan, shabd, arthapatti or anuplabdhi
 According to the philosophy of Mimamsa, Veda is unconquerable, continual and supreme and Veda-propounded meaning is called Dharma
 iske duusare sutara main kaha gaya he- The theory of epistemology is unique
 isaki gananaa anishvaravaadi darshanon main he
 Spirit, Brahma, Jagat etc

 yah keval veda vaa uske shabd kii nityata kaa hi pratipaadan karata he
 According to this, mantras are everything
 ve hi devtaa hai; devataaon kii alag koi satta nahin
 In 'bhattadipika' it is clearly said that the word 'mere deity'
 mimasakon kaa tark yah he ki sab karmfal ke uddeshy se hote hai
 Fruits are achieved by karma, so they say that apart from the words of karma and its proponents, what is the need to obey a god or god from above
 mimasakon or naiyayikon main bada baari bhed yah he ki mimasak shabd ko nity maanate hai or naiyayik anitya 
 Both Sankhya and Mimamsa are atheistic, but both recognize the authenticity of the Veda
 bhed itnaa hi he ki sankhya prayek kalp main veda kaa naveen prakaashan maanata he or mimasak use nity arthath kalpant main bhi nasht na honevaala kehete hai
 The Mimamsa philosophy is of 16 chapters, with 12 chapters in order
 shastrasangati, adhyaysangati, padasngati or adhikarasangatiyon se susambaddha he
 What is left in these twelve chapters is represented in the remaining four chapters, which is famous as 'sankarshakand'
 usamen devtaa ke adhikaar kaa vivechan kiya gaya he, at: use 'devtaa kand' bhi kehete hai athwa dwadash adhyyon kaa parishisht bhi kah sakate hai
 Bhaskar Rai Dixit has written at the end of the interpretation of the Sankarshan Kand that despite the Shodasadhyayi Mimamsa, Dwadasadhyay used to have a reading in the Middle Ages
 is darshan ke prathamadhyay main dharmapramaanon kaa nirupan kiya gaya he or vidhi, arthwaad mantra, smriti, shishtachar, namadhey, sandigdharth nirnaayak vaakyashesh or samarthy kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 In Dwitiyadhyaya, word, practice, number, noun, property and case, these six deeds are proof of distinction
 tritiyadhyaay main shruti, ling, vaakya, prakaran, sthaan or samakhya ye chha: viniojak pramaan hai
 In Chaturvadhyaya, there are six explanatory proofs in Shruti Artha, recitation, place, main and propensity
 panchmaadhyay main atidesh, pratyakshvachanaatidesh, namatidesh, kalpit vachanaatidesh, ashrayatidesh or sthanpatti atidesh ye saat prakaar ke atidesh hai
 The two distinctions of the end are not mentioned in Saptamadhyaya
 ye indriya kamadhikaran tathaa sthanpatti atidesh main nirupit hai
 In the sixth chapter, there is a decision on the right of the performers and performers of yagyas
 saatven or aathven main ek yajna kii vidhi ko duusare yajna main karne kaa varnan he
 The eighth chapter describes the method of performing a yajna in another yajna
 navam adhyay main teen prakaar ke "ooh" kaa nirupan he 
 There are representations of three types of 'baadha' in Dasamadhyay
 ekadshadhyay main tantra or aavaay kaa nirupan he
 Dwadasadhyaya has a representation of "context"
 is prakaar ek-ek vishay kaa pratipaadan dwadashadhyaayaatmak mimasaa darshan main kiya gaya he jise "dwadashalakshani" bhi kaha gaya he
 Here the word 'symptom' is epistemological
 isko do prakaar se vibhakt kiya gaya he jise upadesh or atidesh kehete hai
 Preaching is discussed in the first chapters
 dwitiya ke chah adhyyon main atidesh kaa vivechan he
 The above preaching is the overarching doctrine
 shaastra deepikacar parthasarathi mishra ke anusaar upadesh vichaar ke ananthar atidesh vichaar kaa aarambh hota he
 There are two chapters in present-day epistemology philosophy
 prayek adhyay main chaar paad hote hai, kintu tritiy, shashth or dasham adhyyon main aath aath paad hai, jise "shabra" adhyay bhi kehete hai
 In this way there are sixty feet in the whole book

 In Mimamsa, each Tribunal has five parts - Subject, Doubt, Antecedent, Antitrust and Principle
 atah sutron ko samajhane ke ke liye yah jaananaa aavashyak hota he ki koi sutara in paanchon main se kiskaa pratipadak he
 In this scripture, very precise rules and tips have been given to find out the meaning of sentence, episode, theme or scripture
 mimasakon kaa yah shloke saamanytah taatparynirnay ke liye prasiddh hai— That is, in order to determine the meaning of a scripture or an episode, seven things must be considered — undertaking, epilogue, practice, singularity, fruit, economism, and subsistence
 mimasak aise hi niyamon ke dwaara veda ke vachanon kaa taatpary nikaalte hai
 The semantics have also been decided thoughtfully
 jaise, yajna ke liye jahaan 'sahasr sanvatsar' ho, vahaan 'sanvatsar' kaa arth diwas lenaa chahie, ityadi
 Epistemology is the exponent of rituals; Hence Mimansak Pourusheya, Apoorusheya consider all sentences to be functional
 ve kehete hai ki prayek vaakya kisi vyapaar yaa karm kaa bodhak hota he, jiskaa koi fal hota he
 Therefore, in relation to something, they consider it very important to decide whether it is a 'law sentence' or just economism
 jaise, "rankshetra main jaao, vahaan swarg rakhaa he"
 There are two sections of this sentence - 'go to battlefield', this is a rhetoric or main statement, and 'there is heaven', it is only economism or secondary matter
 iske sutara jaimini ke hai or bhashya shabar swami kaa he
 Kumaril Bhatt's 'kantantravartik' and 'shlokavartik' are also famous on Mimamsutra
 madhavacharya ne bhi 'jaimineey nyaayamala vistaar' naamak ek bhashya rachaa he

 It should have 700 Aryas stored but the number of Aryans has reached 760 in different versions
 at: yah kahana kathin he ki uplabdh aaryasptshati kshepakon se rahit he
 This collection was very popular in the medieval era and many out of date compositions were written with the shadow of his Aryans
 bihari kavi kii "satsai" is sangrah se bahut prabhavit he
 It is mentioned in Aryasaptashati that this attempt was made to inculcate the stream of Shringaaras which was available only in Prakrit
 yahan sanket haal kii "gathasptshati" kii ore he
 Haal has composed adornments in Prakrit saga
 govardhan ne inhi gaathaon ko apni aryaaon kaa adarsh banaaya
 Prakrit's saga is closer to the Sanskrit Aryanchands, so Govardhan chose Aryachanda to create
 keval chand main hi nahin apitu bhavchitran main bhi govardhan haal kaa bahudhaa anukaran karte hai
 But it should not be understood from this that Aryasaptashati is just a Sanskrit translation of Gathasaptashati
 jab bhi govardhan kisi gaatha ke bhav ko vyakt karnaa chaahate hai, ve usamen apni moulik pratibha ke pradarshan se nahin chookte
 Therefore, despite being grossly affected by Aryasapsati Gathasaptashati, it is quite malic in itself
 shringaar kii abhivyakti ke liye govardhan ko acharya mana jaataa he
 In his compositions, the boisterous form of dressing has come open
 kahin-kahin to nagn chithran apni nagnata ke kaaran rasabhas utpann kar dete hai
 At one place, Govardhan has also spoken of kissing the dead body in love

 1962 ke cuba sankat ke baad sanyukt rajya america or soviet sangh ke vyavhaar main aae paritarwanon ko tanavshithily yaa 'ditant' kaa naam diya jaataa he
 After the Cuban crisis, there was some moderation in the atmosphere of the Cold War and the feeling of tension between the two factions was seen to change to a sense of harmony and friendship
 isse donon deshon ke madhya madhur sambandhon kii shuruyaat hone ke lakshan prakat hone lage
 The tradition changed the landscape of the old international relations arising out of the Cold War and a peaceful atmosphere was born in the world
 isse sanyukt raashtra sangh kii bhoomika main bhi vruddhi hui or parmaanu yuddh ke aatank se chhutkaaraa mila
 The Oxford English Dictionary calls the end of tense relations between the two states a 'dittan'

 The following are the main reasons for the tension between the US and the Soviet Union after World War II or the decrease in the Cold War: is prakaar donon deshon ke madhya vyaapt sheet yuddh dhire dhire tanaav shithily kii disha main mudane laga or nae anterrashtriya sambandhon kaa vaataavaran taiyaar ho gaya jisamen bhay kii bajaay shaanti va sauhaard kaa sthaan sarvopari tha
 After the Cuban crisis in 1963, the two superpowers considered leaving the path of confrontation and adopting a policy of peaceful co-existence
 donon ne aapasi tanaav ko kam karne ke liye kuch prayaas kiye jo nimnlikhit hai- In addition to these efforts, the Moscow negotiations between the two superpowers in 1972, the Sabbat-1 Agreement of 1972, the Soviet union-us Economic Cooperation, the American visit to Behnev, 1973, the apollo-soyuz Mail in Space, the Salt-2 Agreement 1979, etc
 The Cold War also decreased
 lekin 1963 se 1970 tak sheet yuddh ke kami ke sanket naam maatr ke rahe
 During this time, tension between the two superpowers over indo-pak war 1965 continued
 1967 main arab-israel yuddh ne bhi sheet yuddh ko jari rakhaa
 During this, efforts have been made to reduce the Cold War and they also got partial success
 isliye ise 'ditant kaa niskriy kaal' kaha jaataa he
 Its real progress began in 1970 and by 1979 it reached its climax
 is samay ko 'ditant kaa sakriy kaal' kaha jaataa he
 At this time, the tradition greatly influenced the international relations and the old winter relationship may be seen to be over
 ditant ne shityudh se utpann puraane antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa paridrishy badalane laga or vishwa main shantipurna vaataavaran kaa janm hua
 It also increased the role of the United Nations and got rid of the terror of nuclear war
