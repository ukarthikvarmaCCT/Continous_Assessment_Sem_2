 The theory of structural engineering is based on empirical knowledge related to physical laws and properties of various materials / geometries
 anekon chote chote sanrachanaatmak avyavon ke yoga se jatil sanrachanaayen nirmit kii jaatin hai
 a structural engineer should not only have the knowledge of iron and steel, but also have advanced knowledge of wood, brick, stone, lime and cement and should also be proficient in mechanical and electrical engineering work, because they are safe and secure according to the principles of their structure, mechanics and physics
 Have to make from bhoomi, jal or vaayu kii prakruti kaa bhi purna gyaan civil ejeeniyar ke samaan hi hona chahie
 Structural engineering was considered a department of civil engineering till the 19th century, but as the requirements of civil society changed and increased according to the circumstances, production and use of advanced types of iron, steel etc
 started to increase, so did mechanics Has progressed
 vividh dhaatuon ke bhautik gunon kaa gyaan badha, to kaarkaanon or awasagruhon ke nirmaan main bhi ispaat kaa adhikadhik upyog hone laga
 With the help of steel structures due to lack of space, many storey houses started to be built and in a small space the system of making many rooms started

 This has happened with the help of structural engineering
 sethunirmaan main bhi sanrachana ejineero se badi sahaayta mili he
 In the famous bridge across the Forth River in Scotland, which is built of cantilever, two arches are formed at the base of three pillars in the middle of the river, each of which is 1,710 feet in length and the bridge across the bridge, from coast to coast, 5215 Ft
 america kaa quebec pul to duniyaan bhar ke canteliver pulon main sabase bada samajha jaataa he
 Its central arch is 1,800 feet
 is pul kaa nirmaan 1918 i
 main samaapt kar, yah yatayaat ke liye chaalu kiya gaya tha
 This bridge is the best example of modern structural art
 neuyark kaa helgate naamak pul keval ek hi mehrabawala he
 Its span is 1,017 feet
 bharat ke pulon main kalakatta kaa haavda pul or haridwar ke nikat rishikesh kaa lakshmana jhula naamak pul is kala ke achche namoonay hai
 The design of each building requires roofs and floors for dharnas, scissors, pillars and a foundation built on the ground
 inkaa sangyojan hi makaan kaa 'dhaanchaa' he
 Whether the structure is for any building, bridge or crane, etc
, it is necessary to consider while constructing them that what kind of force and how much quantity of external force will fall on their various components
 sthitiki ke siddhantanusaar un balon ke kaaran, dhaanche ke vividh avyavon par aanevaale pratibalon kii gananaa bhi badi saavdhaanee se kerani hoti he, jisase dhaanchaa sab prakaar se sudrudh or niraapad ban jaae
 Making the structure strong does not mean making its components very thick and heavy
 dhaanche kii banaavat main bal sahan karne kii kshamta honi chahie
 Such a structure is made by combining several triangles
 chaturbhujon or panchabhujon se bane dhaanche main itani kshamta nahin hoti
 The triangular frame is called scissors
 ye balon ke sahane ke drushtikon se sarvatha nirdosh or avyavon kii drushti se swat: purna hoti he
 Such scissors can be made for very long legs and can also be balanced on its own
 bade paat kii chhaten banane ke liye deevaaron par saadhaaran thos prakaar ke lambey garder rakhkar hi kyon nahin kaam chalaaya jaataa? trikoawmay kainchiyan hi kyon banaai jaati hai? maamuli chote paaton kii chhaten to avashya hi uchit maap ke sade garder rakhkar banaai ja sakati hai, parantu garder bahut adhik lambey hone par baari tathaa mahange padate hai
 For large legs, triangular canes are very strong and very light and cheap
 kainchiyon ke jodon ko pinon dwaara na banaakar ribaton dwaara pakkaa jad diya jaataa he
 Some special types of forces start coming in the rebats which these rebates must be made stronger to bear
 samast chat ke pataav kaa bhaar batton ke madhyam se vibhajit hokar kainchiyon ke trikonon ke upree jodon par aakar, sab kainchiyon par baraabar bantkar or in kainchiyon ke bhaar sahit aadha-aadha bantkar diwaar ke teke par padakar antatah buniyaad par jaataa he
 Therefore, these burdens have to be estimated very carefully
 ye bojhe sadaiv ek se hi bane rahane ke kaaran achal bhaar kehalaate hai
 All vertical walls and sloping roofs are subjected to the vertical pressure caused by the side air, which is called air pressure and it comes in the count of moving load
 anek manzile makaanon kii madhyavarti chhaton par vahaan ke nivaasiyon or uthau fernichar kaa bhaar hi hota he lekin yah anya achal bhaaron kii apeksha naganya hota he
 The forces falling on different components of the structure are calculated according to the principle of force triangle or force polygons
 iske liye ejeeniyar "bau sanket" pranali kaa upyog karte hai
 This method is relatively simple
 balon kaa pariklan vishuddh ganit dwaara bhi sthitiki or trikonmiti kii sahaayta se kiya ja saktaa he
 To calculate in this way, assuming an appropriate point to be the center of the pulverizer, equate the rotating force of unknown force falling in a component of the structure
 jitne hi adhik bade paat kii chat kii kanchi athwa pul kaa kanchinuma garder anaaya jaataa he usamen utane hi adhik sankhya main chote chote trikon banaae jate hai
 If a load is placed on a long pole, then after moving beyond a boundary, that pole starts to bend from the middle
 yahi baat kainchiyon ko bal sahan karne yogya uchit aakaar ke chote chote trikon banaae jate hai
 If a load is placed on a long pole, then after moving beyond a boundary, that pole starts to bend from the middle
 yah baat kainchiyon ke thaamon par bhi lagu hoti he
 Therefore, the scissors are divided into small triangles of appropriate size to withstand the force
 dhaanchaa par jo boj padate hai use bhaar kehete hai
 Movable and fixed loads are mentioned above
 yadi bhaar kisi thodi si jagah par kendrit he, to use kendrit bhaar or yadi puure avyavon par failaa ho, to use vibhajit bhaar kehete hai
 The load of the vehicles, trains, motors, trucks, etc
, is called the load and the load coming from one direction and immediately after the other direction is called the load with the alternating load and the impact load
 padaarthon kaa pratibal bhi hota he
 Stress, compression, shear, cramps etc
 can be stress due to the condition and tendency of the load
 pratibal ke prabhaav se jo parivartan hota he use vikruti kehete hai
 Substances have the property of elasticity, less in some and less in some and more in some
 pratyasthata kii seemaa hoti he
 Substances that exceed the limit are broken
 hook ne san 1676 main ek niyam sthapit kiya ki yadi prayek padaarth par uski pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar bal lagaaya jaae, to uske kaaran padanevaala pratibal tathaa us padaarth main honevaali vikruti main ek vishesh anupaat hoga
 In 1826, Dr
 Young definitively ascertained the proportions of deformations in various substances due to stresses falling within the range of elasticity
 ise yang kaa pratyasthata mapank kehete hai
 The tensile and compression ratios are expressed by the E, shear ratios C, or the letter g and the volume ratios are expressed by the k letter: pratyaksh pratyasthata mapank Transverse elasticity modulus sampeden se padaarthon kaa aaytan ghat jaataa he
 Thus, the elastic elasticity modulus tapochar tathaa yantropchaar se pratyasthata mapaankon main parivartan ho jaaya karata he
 If a solid rod is pulled, we see that it breaks thinly in the middle and if it is pulled by applying force within the range of elasticity, its lateral measurement becomes smaller as it increases in length
 
 isi prakaar yadi kisi chad ko dabaaya jaae, to uski parshvik naap bad jaati he
 Therefore, the change in the lateral measurements of a direct solid due to stretch or pressure is in proportion to the Poisson
 ise m akshar se vyakt karte hai
 a pure mismatch is in the form of a mixture of stresses, two materials and each other acting in opposite directions
 inaki kriya rekha bhi ek duusare se samakon par hoti he
 If one end of the axle is firmly tightened in the wall and the other end is applied with force, the other end will be slightly bent
 mula rekha se jitna kone, dd banaakar vah mudata he vah kone uskaa anthan kone hoga
 With the help of this angle the spasm force of axle can be removed
 ejiniyari main kaam aanevaali samagriyon kaa pareekshan atyaavashyak he
 Placing them under the same conditions as the materials used, should be tested
 pareekshan do prakaar se hota he : ek raasayanik reeti se samagriyon ke aanvik sanghathan kaa gyaan hota he or bhautik reeti se khinchakar, dabaakar, aparupan kar, panch se chhedakar, jhukaa kar tathaa modakar dekha jaataa he ki unke sahan karne kii samta kisi he
 Nowadays, a device has been made to test the material in physical way, which is called Hounsfield tensometer
 isaki kaarypaddati badi saral he or saamaanya vyakti bhi thode se prashikshan se iskaa upyog kar saktaa he
 With this, knowledge of the strength of materials, load distortion, abstinence etc
 is easily achieved
 jab tak kisi padaarth par padanevaale pratibal us padaarth kii pratyasthata kii seemaa ke bheetar rahata he, tab tak vikruti badi sookshm yaa asthaayee hoti he
 As soon as the weight is removed, that substance returns to its original state
 par yadi pratibal pratyasthata kii seemaa ke upar ho, to vikruti paryaapt ore adhik sthaayee hoti he
 The fraction weight is much higher than the limit of elasticity, but in terms of trade and utility, this weight is kept low and is called the point of defeat and it is considered as the differential weight
 pratyasthata kii seemaa sahane yogya bhaar se bhi kaaphi kam maatra main bhaar daalane kii yojana, abhiklpana ke samay kii jaati he
 Therefore, the ratio in which this practical load is less than the most bearable load, that ratio is called the Abbey Coefficient or Depressor of that substance
 ise nimnlikhit sutara se vyakt kiya jaataa he : Representatives of different substances are different in different states
 kathor ispaat kaa abhayank sthir bhaar main teen tathaa chal bhaar main paanch se aath or prayavarti chal bhaar main nau se 13 tak hota he
 The hardness of materials can easily be estimated by their stress, compression, contouring, etc
 forces
 kathorta pareekshan kii aadhunik vidhiyaan, sthitik danturata or gatyaatmak danturata ke siddhanton par aadhaarit hai
 Are based on static dentistry theory
 sthitik danturata siddhant par aadhaarit hai
 Brinell's hardness-test-method based on static dentistry theory, according to which a part of the test substance is polished finely like glass, and is pressed on it with standard weights by instruments by placing a bullet of very hardened steel, standard diameter
 isse polish kii hui sataha par gol nishaan pad jaataa he
 By measuring the diameter of the mark, remove the hardness of the bullet according to the following formula: yadi goli kaa vyas d or nishaan kaa vyas d mimi
 hoti to Joe Krigra Per square mm It is written in saadharantaya goli kaa vyas 10 mimi
 or lohe tathaa ispaat ke liye 3,000 kigra
, pital aadi mulaayam dhaatuon ke liye 1,000 kriga
 or sis aadi bahut mulaayam dhaatu ke padaarthon ke liye 50 kriga
 maanak bhaar rakhaa jaataa he
 The weight is usually kept so that the diameter of the mark does not exceed 3 / 8 of the diameter of the bullet
 pareekshan kisi bhi vyas kii goli se kiya ja saktaa he, par daab or goli ke vyas kaa anupaat, p / , ek sa rahanaa chahie
 a steel bullet is used for general hardness and a diamond bullet for high hardness
 kathor padaarthon par 15 second tak or mulaayam padaarthon par 30 second tak bhaar diya jaataa he
 There is a system of finely measuring the mark
 wickers vidhi se bhi kathortank nikaala jaataa he
 In this place, Hirakni is used in the form of a square pyramid in place of bullet
 isse chaukor gaddha banataa he, jiskaa vikarn or gaharaai adhik yatharthata se naapi ja sakati he
 The hardness is extracted from it as follows: gatyamak danturata par aadhaarit anek yantra bane hai, jinamein shor ) kaa banaaya hua scale roscp sarvaadhik prasiddh he
 It consists of a cylindrical hammer of steel, weighing about 40 grains

 Similarly, the compression of various substances multiplied by the appropriate constants and the algebraic strength may also be known
 sanrachana ejiniyari ke kaamon main vividh prakaar ke bal dekhe jate hai
 They can be divided into the following six major categories: vibhinn avyav ribaton dwaara, athwa bolton dwaara, jode jate hai
 The joints made by the rebats are permanent and can be cut apart, but the joints made by bolts are temporary and can be opened in different subdivisions
 sanrachana kaary main sabhi prakaar ke avyav mulaayam ispaat ke vividh pariched yukt chhadon or platon se banaae jate hai
 The passages of the rods are round, flat, rectangular, L, t or h etc
 kaarkaane main hi badi kainchiyon kaa nirmaan karte samay unke samast avyav nakshe ke anusaar alag alag kaat chhantakar banaae jate hai tathaa kuch chote chote upkhando ko to kaarkaane main hi samtal bhoomi par rakhkar, ribaton dwaara yathasthaan jad dete hai; phir un jude hue upkhandon ko kraine aadi sadhano se uthaakar yathasthaan baitaakar, bolton dwaara kas dete hai
 The strength of stems and thams depends on how much stress they have and by dividing by their bearable, secure square per square inch, their passages are determined by mathematics and they are constructed accordingly
 sanrachit dhaanchon main dharanon tathaa gardaron kaa bada mahatvapurn sthaan he, kyonki unheen par chauras chhaton, pulon, gantriyon tathaa shiroparidhaavan pathon aadi ke sthir, char or chal bhaar laade jate hai
 When both ends of a straight component are loaded on it by hinging it on a strong base, it is called a dharna or girder
 dharan par bojha rakhane se vah bich main lachak ja sakati he or yadi usapar bojha samarthy se adhik ho, to uski nichali sataha fatne lagati he

 unke lekh tathaa vichaaron ne bharatiyon ke man main unke prati sneh utpann kar diya
 Now she started thinking day and night about working among Indians
 1883 main ve samaajawaadee vichaardhaara kii ore aakarshith huin
 He formed an organization called 'socialist Defense Organization'
 is sanstha main unki sevaaon ne unhen kaaphi sammaan diya
 This organization provided protection to the workers who took part in the procession on the streets of London
 1889 main ani bessent thiosophy ke vichaaron se prabhavit huin
 Within him was the art of making a powerful, unique and unique speech
 at: bahut sheeghra unhone apane liye thiosophical sosayadi kii ek pramukh vaktaa ke rup main mahatvapurn sthaan bana liya
 He made a lifelong attempt to bind the whole world through the branches of theosophy in the thread of unity
 unhone bharat ko thiosophy kii gatividhiyon kaa kendra banaaya
 He arrived in India in 1893
 san 1906 tak inkaa adhikansh samay varanasi main beetaa
 She was elected president of the Theosophical Society in 1907
 unhone paashchaatya bhautikwaadi sabhyataa kii kadi aalochana karte hue pracheen hindu sabhyataa ko shreshth siddh kiya
 In the religious, educational, social and political fields, he started the work of national renaissance
 bharat ke liye raajnneetik swatantraaa aavashyak he is uddeshy kii prapti ke liye unhone 'homerul aandolan' sangathit karke uskaa netritv kiya
 On 20 September 1933, she became Brahmin
 aaajeevan varanasi ko hi hriday se apana ghar maanane vaali bessent kii asthiyaan varanasi laai gayin or shaanti-kunj se nikle ek vishaal jan-samooh ne un apsheshon ko sasamman sursari ko samarpit kar diya
 The motto of Dr
 Besant's life was 'karma'
 vah jis siddhanth par vishwaas karatin use apane jivan main utaar kar upadesh deteen
 She considered India as her motherland
 ve janm se irish, vivaah se angrej tathaa bharat ko apana lene ke kaaran bhartiya thim
 Tilak, Jinnah and even Mahatma Gandhi praised his personality
 ve bharat kii swatantraaa ke naam par apana balidaan karne ko sadaiv tatpar rahati thim
 She was a fan of the Indian varna system
 parantu unke saamne samasya thi ki ise vyavhaarik kaise banaaya jaay taaki saamaajik tanaav kam ho
 He believed that there should be proper management of education
 shiksha main dharmik shiksha kaa samavesh ho
 To give such education, he founded the Central Hindu School in Varanasi in 1898
 saamaajik buraaiyon jaise bal vivaah, jati vyavastha, vidhwaa vivaah, videsh yatra aadi ko dur karne ke liye unhone 'bros of sarvice' naamak sanstha kaa sanghathan kiya
 For membership of this institution it was necessary that they had to sign the pledge written below - 1
 main jati panti par aadhaarit chuaachhut nahin karungaa
 2
 i will not marry my sons before 18 years
 3
 main apni putriyon kaa vivaah 16 varsh se pehle nahin karunga

 8
 main kaaryakartaaon main aadhyatmik shiksha evam saamaajik or raajnneetik unnati ke kshetra main ekta laane kaa praytn bhartiya rashtriya congress ke netritv va nirdesan main karunga
 Dr
 Annie Besant believed that it is not possible to solve all these difficulties without political freedom
 dow ani bessent swabhaavat: dharmik pravriti kii mahila thim
 The foundation of his political thought was his spiritual and moral values
 unka vichaar tha ki achchhai ke maarg kaa nirdhaaran bina aadhyatm ke sambhav nahin
 To achieve a welfare life, human desires should be subject to divine will
 raashtra kaa nirmaan evam vikaas tabhi sambhav he jab us desh ke vibhinn dharmon, manyataon evam samskritiyon main ekta sthapit ho
 Knowledge of true religion is attained only by spiritual consciousness
 unke in vichaaron ko mahatma gandhi ne bhi sweekaar kiya
 The nature of civilization and culture of ancient India was spiritual
 yahi aadhyatmikta us samay ke bharatiyon kii nidhi thi
 The aim of Dr
 Besant was to remove the distortions in Hindu society and its spirituality
 unhone bhartiya punarjanm main vishwaas karnaa shuru kiya
 She was convinced that she was a Hindu in a previous life
 vah dharm or vigyaan main koi bhed nahin maanati thim
 He had full faith in religious tolerance
 unhone bhartiya dharm kaa gambheer adhyayan kiya
 His translation of the Bhagavad Gita 'that's on the study of the Bhagavad Gita' is a proof that he had deep faith in Hindu religion and philosophy
 ve kaha karti thim ki hindu dharm main itane sampradaayon kaa hona is baat kaa pramaan he ki isamen swatantra bauddhik vikaas ko protsaahan diya jaataa he
 She believed that India only had the ability to guide the world
 ve bharat ke sadiyon se andh vishwaason se grast maanav ko mukt karnaa chaahati thim
 Dr
 Besant saw the ideal of service to the poor in socialism
 garibi dur karne ke liye unka vishwaas tha ki audyogikaran ho
 He saw that the woman had no freedom
 ve log bhoga kii vastu samajhi jaati thim
 Dr
 Besant's heart was moved by this sad state
 unhone nari suraksha kaa prashn uthaaya or jor dekar kaha ki samaaj main sarvangin vikaas ke liye nari adhikaron ko surakshit karnaa aavashyak he
 Dr
 Besant was an advocate of the ancient religion based varna system
 varna vyavastha kaa mukhya uddeshy kaary vibhaajan tha jiske anusaar samaaj kaa prayek vyakti apane kaaryon ko karne kii yogyata dwaara brahman, kshatriya, vaisya evam shudra kaa sthaan praapt karata tha
 She used to say that according to Mahabharata, a Brahmin has the qualities of a Shudra and is a Shudra
 shudra main agar brahman ke gun hai to vah brahman samajha jaayga
 Traveling abroad was considered irreligious at that time
 unhone bataaya ki pracheen aitihaasik tathyon se pataa chalata he ki shyaam, java, sumatra, kamboj, lanka, tibet tathaa china aadi deshon main hindu rajya ke chihn paye gayi hai
 Hence, foreign travel of Hindus is certified
 unhone videsh yatra ko protsaahan diye jane kaa samarthan kiya
 According to him, uplifting the nation with the combination of spiritual intelligence and physical strength has been the specialty of ancient India
 ve vidhwaa vivaah ko dharm maanati thim
 He believed that except adult widows, adolescent and youth widows should marry to prevent social evil
 ve antarjaatiy vivaahon ko bhi dharm sammat maanati thim
 She considered polygamy as an insult to women's pride and a curse of society
 kisi bhi desh ke nirmaan main prabud varg kii bhoomika mahatvapurn hoti he
 This enlightened class is a product of that country's education
 at: shiksha vyavastha ko ve atyadhik mahatv detii thim
 He insisted that religious and moral education should be compulsorily taught in education courses and to be based on ancient Indian ideals
 unki dharna thi ki prayek bhartiya ko sanskrit tathaa angreji donon kaa gyaan hona chaiye
 From 1913 to 1919 she was one of the leading personalities in Indian political life
 sitambar 1916 main unhone homerul lig kii sthapana kii or swarajya ke adarsh ko lokapriy banane ke liye prachaar kiya kintu 1919 ke baad ve akeli pad gayi
 The immediate reason for this was his dispute with Bal Gangadhar Tilak
 jab gandhi ji ne apana satyagrah aandolan prarambh kiya to vah bhartiya raajnneeti kii mukhya dhara se or bhi pruthak ho gai
 It is a matter of great misfortune that Annie Besant condemned Gandhiji's non-cooperation movement in a very unsympathetic language, describing his movement as revolutionary, anarchist, and a movement that exudes hatred and violence
 gandhi ke darshan evam netritv ko unhone swatantraaa ke maarg main sabase badi baadha bataaya tha
 He described Gandhiji as an obscure swaraj watcher and a mystic politician
 unhen is baat se sandeh tha ki gandhi ji sachche hriday se pashchaatap, upwas, tapasya aadi main vishwaas karte hai
 He warned the people of the country that if the Gandhian system was adopted, the country would again fall into the ravine of anarchy
 pratibha-sampann lekhika or swatantra vichaarak hone ke naate shrimati ani bessent ne theosophy par kareeb 220 pustakon va lekhon kii baadh laga di thi
 His pen name also came from the nickname 'ajax'

 In 1893, he published his autobiography
 unki jeevaniparak kritiyon kii sankhya 6 he
 In 1895, he published sixteen books and many templates in just one year, which was more than 900 pages

 Nearly 77 flowers bloom on Indian politics
 unki moulik kritiyon se chaynit lagbhag 28 granthon kaa pranayan hua
 Annie Besant also edited 'lucifer', 'the Commonweal' and 'new India' from time to time
 gat shatabdi main prakashit unke prasiddh granth nimnlikhit hai : The following are well known in the works made by Mrs
 Annie Besant in the twentieth century - is prakaar kul milajula kar kariban 505 granthon va lekhon kii malikaa dow ani bessent ne 'haau india raut for freedom' main bharat ko apni mathrubhumi batalaaya he
 In the book which was confiscated 'india: a Nation', he has proposed the idea of autonomous governance
 1917 main najarband kiye jane se pehle sattar varshiya vriddha ne apane bharat ke bhaaiyon or bahanon ko aakhri sandesh diya tha : main vriddha hoon, kintu mujhe vishwaas he ki marane ke pehle hi main dekhuungi ki bharat ko swytt-shashan mil gaya
 In India, salt has been taxed since early times
 parantu mughal samraaton kii apeksha east india company ke shashan kaal main isamen atyadhik vruddhi kar di gai
 In 1835 it was taxed for the interests of British salt merchants
 jisase bharat main namak kaa aayaat hone laga or east india company ke vyapaariyon ko bahut phayda hua
 Even after the change of power in 1858, the tax continued
 bharatiyon dwaara isaki aarambh se hi ninda kii gai
 In the first conference of the Congress of 1885, SA Swaminathan Iyer raised this issue
 baad main gandhiji ne 1930 main ise vyapak mudda bana diya
 After Gandhi's arrest after the Dandi March, Salt Satyagraha took place in Dharsana under the leadership of Sarojini
 rajagopalaachari ne madras ke vedamaranyam main usee varsh namak kanoon todaa
 The Dandi March received international headlines
 magar namak kanoon 1946 tak chalata rahaa jabatak ki jawaharlal nehru antarim sarkaar ke pradhanmantri banakar ise nirast nahin kiya
 Taxation of salt- German scholar MJ Sladen wrote in his book Salz that there is a direct relationship between salt tax and tanassahi
 iskaa pramaan itihaas detaa he ki sarvaadhik nirankush sabhyataaen ve hai jinhone ki namak or uske vyapaar par kar lagaaya he
 The salt tax was first imposed in China
 300 i
 pu
 main likhi gai pustak gwanji main namak kar lagane kii anushansha kii gai he jo aage china kii sarkari or iske liye vibhinn tarikon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 It is famous that Guanji's recommendations soon became the salt policy of Chinese governments
 ek samay namak kar china kii rajasav kaa aadha tha or usne china kii diwaar ke nirmaan main mahatvapurn yogadan diya he
 In Chandragupta, the fourth share of salt was taken as tax
 mughalon ke samay hinduon se 5% or musalamaanon se 2
5% namak kar liya jaataa tha
 In 1759 the British doubled the rent of land and also imposed a tax on the transport of salt
 1767 ko tambaku or nariyal ke baad 7 oktober 1768 ko namak par bhi company ke ekadhikaar ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 In 1772, Warren Hastings again brought the salt tax under the company
 usne iske liye agent banaae
 The company offered land on leases to the highest bidders
 isane mazdooron ke shoshan ko janm diya
 In 1788, salt was given to the wholesalers by auctioning
 isane namak ke daam ko ek rupe se badhaakar 4 roope kar diya
 This was a highly painful situation in which only a few people were able to eat food with salt
 1802 main orisa ke vijay ke baad angrejon ne namak ke utpaadan par kar badha diya or malangi karj main duubakar das banate gaye
 In the early 19th century, the East India Company set up investigation centers to make salt tax more profitable and to prevent its smuggling
 ji ech smith ne ek seemaa khinchi jiske paar namak ke parivahan par adhik kar dena padataa tha
 By 1869, the border had spread across India
 2300 mile tak sindhu se madras tak faile kshetra main lagbhag 12 hajaar log tainaat kiye gaye the
 It was a border made of thorn bushes, stones and mountains beyond which it could not be reached without investigation
 1923 main lord reeding ke samay namak kar ko duguna karne kaa vidheyak paas kiya gaya
 In 1927, the Bill was again introduced, which was vetoed
 1835 ke namak kar ayog ne anusansha kii ki namak ke aayaat ko protsaahit karne ke liye namak par kar lagaaya janaa chahie
 The production of salt was later made a crime
 1882 main bane bhartiya namak kanoon ne sarkaar ko punah ekadhikaar sthapit kara diya
 On 12 March 1930, Mandhi moved to Dandi from Sabarmati with 39 followers
 or 6 april 1930 ko namak kanoon tod diya
 And announced the end of British rule

 Acharya Rai was not only the first Indian spokesman of modern chemistry, but he also laid the foundation of the chemical industry in this country
 'sada jivan ucch vichaar' vaale unke bahuaiami vyaktitv se prabhavit hokar mahatma gandhi ne kaha tha, "shuddh bhartiya paridhaan main aaveshtit is saral vyakti ko dekhakar vishwaas hi nahin hota ki vah ek mahaan vaigyanik ho saktaa he
 "the genius of Acharya Rai was so unique that upon the publication of his autobiography" Life and Experiences of Bengali Chemist ", the highly respected international science magazine" Nature "paid him homage, writing that" to write, possibly from Prafulla Chandra Rai No one else can have a more specific life character
 " Dr
 Rai is called the 'master of Nitrites'
 unhen rasayan ke alaav itihaas se bada prem tha
 As a result, after studying deeply for 10-12 years, he wrote an important book called History of Hindu Chemistry, which brought you great fame

 While working in the Presidency College, he got to read the book "the Greek Alchemy" by the then great French chemist Barthelo
 turant unhone barthelo ko patr likhaa ki bharat main bhi ati prachinkaal se rasayan kii parampara rahi he
 At Bartello's insistence, Acharya sent him a long introductory article about ancient Hindu chemistry based on Nagarjuna's book "rasendrasarasangraha"
 barthelat ne isaki ek atyant vidvattapurna samiksha "jarnal de saawant" main prakashit kii, jisamen acharya raay ke kaary kii bhuri-bhuri prashansa kii gai thi
 Encouraged by this, Acharya finally propounded his famous book "history of Hindu Chemistry" which became world famous and through which the entire world was amazed by the vast chemistry of ancient India

 Acharya Prafulla Chandra Rai was a born patriot
 unki aatmakatha main iske pramaan sthaan-sthaan par prakat hue hai
 While studying modern chemistry in Edinburgh, he used to worry about why India is not contributing in the field of science
 yahaan 1885 main unhone ek nibandh pratiyogita main bhaag liya jiskaa vishay tha- "bharat-gadar ke pehle or baad"
 He severely criticized the British Raj in his article
 pratiyogita ke pashchaat unhone yah lekh bharat ke mitra samajhe jane vaale british saansad jon brit ko bhej diya
 Bright praised the article very much
 baad main acharya ne ise ek laghu pustika ke rup main prakashit karvaa diya
 Even while giving lectures in the chemistry class to the students in the Presidency College, Acharya Prafulla Chandra Rai did not forget to say that "science can wait but Swaraj can not" ie science can wait but not Swaraj
 1892 main unhone is desh kii pratham rasinic udyog company "bengal chemicals and pharmaceuticals works" kii sthapana kii jo aaj bhi bengal chemicals ke naam se karyrat he

 purvi slav un slav logon ko kaha jaataa he jo purvi slavi bhashaayen bolte hai
 It was initially inhabited by a medieval state called Kyivian Russia but by the 17th century had divided into Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian subcastes
 purvi slaavon ke bare main 859 isvi se pehle ke kaal main zyaada jaankaree nahin he
 The reason for this is that their regions were far from the rest of Europe and there was no written form of their language
 863 main sirilik lipi vishesh rup se slavi bhashaaon ko likhane ke liye ijad kii gai
 By 600 CE, the Slavic people are believed to have divided into eastern, western and southern branches

 There has been a mutual disagreement among historians about where this Slav came from
 haalanki pehali sadi se lekar navi sadi tak pontic-caspian stapi se saramati, hun, awaar, bulgaar or magyaar jaisi bahut si jatiyaan nikali or slav kai ke saath sampark main aaye honge, lekin koi bhi slaviyon ke ilaaqon main nahin bases
 By the 8th century, the Slavs had become the dominant caste in the Eastern European plains

 The rise of Islam occurred in the Arabian Peninsula in the seventh century
 iske antim nabi mohammad sallallahu alaihi vasallam kaa janm 570 isvi main makka main hua tha
 Around 613 AD, Muhammad Sahib began to preach his wisdom to the people
 isi ghatana kaa islam kaa aarambh jaataa he
 However, till this time it was not seen as a new religion
 parvarti varshon main muhammd s0 ke anuyaayiyon ko makka ke logon dwaara virodh tathaa muhammd ke madina prasthaan se hi islam ko ek dharmik sampradaay mana gaya
 Over the next few years many enlightened people became followers of Muhammad
 unke anuyaayiyon ke prabhaav main aakar bhi kai log musalmaan bane
 After this Muhammad sahib returned to Mecca and conquered Makkah without fighting and all the opponents of Mecca were pardoned
 is maafi kii ghatana ke baad makka ke sabhi log islam main parivartit hue
 But Pember faced many protests and negative situations, but he squeezed the positivity out of every negativity, which led to his victory in every sphere of life
 unki vafaat ke baad arabon kaa samrajya or jazbaa badhata hi gaya
 The Arabs first conquered Egypt and North Africa and then defeated the Byzantine and Persian empires
 europe main to unhen vishesh safalataa nahin mili par faras main kuch sangharsh karne ke baad unhen jeet milane lagi
 After this, his empire failed in the east
 san 1200 tak ve bharat tak pahunch gaye
 
 hazrat mohammad sahab kaa janm 570 i
 main "makka" main hua
 Your family dominated a large religious site in Mecca
 us samay arab main yahudee, isai dharm or bahut saare samooh jo murtipujak the qabeelon ke rup main the
 At this time people gathered in Kaaba in Mecca and mass worship was done
 aapane kaadija naam kii ek vidhwaa vyapaaree ke liye kaam karnaa aarambh kiya
 Later, at the age of 25, he married her
 san 613 main aapane logon ko ye bataanaa aarambh kiya ki unhen parameshwar se yah sandesh aayaa he ki ishwar ek he or wo insaanon ko sachai tathaa eemaandaaree kii raah par chalane ko kahata he
 He also opposed idolatry
 par makka ke logon ko ye baat pasand nahin ai
 Muhammad Sahab had to leave Mecca in 622
 muslmaan is ghatana ko hijra kehete hai or yahaan se islamic calendar hijri aarambh hota he
 In the next few days, he had many followers in Medina, then he returned to Mecca and defeated the rulers of Mecca in battle
 iske baad kai log unke anuyaayi ho gaye or unke samarthakon ko musalmaan kaha is dauraan unhen kai virodhon tathaa ladaayeeyaan ladani padi
 First of all, there was a battle of Badr with cousins of his own clan - in which an army of 313 defeated the invasion of about 900 people
 iske baad arab prayadweep ke kai hisson main jaakar virodhiyon se yuddh hue
 Jews and some Christians also lived in Mecca and Medina at that time
 par us samay unako ek alag dharm ko rup main na dekh kar ishwar kii eksatta ke samarthak mana jaataa tha
 Hazrat Muhammad Makkah returned
 logon ko aisa lag rahaa tha ki bada yuddh hoga, laqin koi yuddh nahin hua, log shantipurvak hi rahe, or mohammad sahab or unke anuyai makkah main pravesh kiya
 In this way Makkah became independent without any war
 mohammad sahab kii makka vaapasi islam ke itihaas main ek mahatvapurn ghatana thi jisase ek sampradaay ke rup main na rah kar yah baad main ek dharm ban gaya
 In 632, you had a problem
 us samay tak sampoorn arab prayadweep islam ke sutara main bandha chukaa tha
 In 632, when Prophet Muhammad died, fear of fragmentation of Muslims arose
 koi bhi vyakti islam kaa vaid uttaradhikari nahin tha
 This successor would also own such a large empire
 isse pehle arab log bagentine yaa farsi senaaon main ladaako ke rup main ladate rahe the par khud kabhi itane bade samrajya ke maalik nahin bane the
 At the same time an institution of Khilafat was formed which decided who is the successor of Islam
 muhammd sahab ke dost abu bakar ko mohammad kaa uttaradhikari ghoshit kiya gaya
 The fourth Khalifa Ali was a supporter of Muhammad Sahab and married Fatimah, the daughter of Muhammad Sahab
 par iske baavjood unke khilaafat ke samay tisare khalipha osman ke samarthakon ne unke khilaafat to chunauti di or arab samrajya main grihayuddh chhid gaya
 Ali was assassinated in 961 and Mu'awiya, a close relative of Osman, declared himself a Khalifa
 isi samay se umeyyad vansh kaa aarambh hua
 It bears its name on the family who played a major role in the battle with Muhammad Sahib before Mecca surrendered to Islam
 jald hi arab samrajya ne bagentine samrajya or saasaani samrajya kaa rup le liya
 Khilafat started transferring from father to son
 rajdhani damishq banaai gai
 The Umayyads preferred the Arabs very much in the empire, but the Arabs criticized them
 arabon kaa kahana tha ki ummayadon ne islam ko bahut hi sansaarik bana diya he or unamem islam ke mul main kii gai baaten kam hoti ja rahi hai
 Together these Muslims considered Ali to be the rightful caliph of Islam
 unhen laga ki ali hi islam kaa vaastavik uttaradhikari ho sakate the
 In 940, a Persian Muslim convert named Abu Muslim created a huge public against the Umayyads
 usne khorasaan main ummayadon ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Already there was resentment against the presence of Arabs in Khorasan, so he got massive public support
 usne yah kahkar logon ko ummyadon ke khilaaf saavdhaan kiya ki ve log islam ke sahi vaaris nahin hai or ve satta kaa durupyog kar rahe hai
 The luxury lifestyle of the Umayyads instigated them even more
 san 949-950 ke bich ummayadon dwaara bheje gaye sainikon ko haraa diya or iske baad apana ek nayaa khalipha ghoshit kar diya - abul abbaas
 Abbas was of Muhammad's lineage but was linked to Muhammad by another brother besides Ali
 par usase abu islam kii lokapriyata dekhi nahin gai or usne abu ko phaansi par lataka diya
 This led to anger among the people against Abbas
 jin logon ko abbaas par bhi bharosa nahin hua ve shiya bane - aaj iran kii 92 % janata shiya he
 However, Abbas and his descendants made their capital in Baghdad and ruled for the next nearly 500 years
 abbasiyon ke samay main iraniyon ko bhi samrajya main bhagidaari mili
 Although he did not hold any religious position, Iranians got the support of the government due to their good in arts like architecture and poetry
 dhyaan rahe ki kai madhyakaalin islamic vichaarak, jyotishi or kavi isi samay paidi hue the
 Omar Khayyam invented a new height in eastern Iran in astrology - a new almanac
 unhone kavitaaon kii rubaai style main maharath hasil kii or vigyaan main kai yoga daan die - jisamen bijganit or khanij-shaastra bhi shaamil hai
 Persian poets like Firdausi and Sufi thinkers like Rumi were born at this time
 haalanki inamen se adhiktar ko baghdad se koi aarthik-vritti nahin mili thi par is main islam ke dharamshastriyon kii dakhal kaa na hona hi ek bada yogadan tha
 At this time, of course, it was difficult to place the entire Islamic empire, which had spread from Spain to India, inside a military hero
 isliye baghdad sirf dharmik mukhyalay rahaa or sthaneey shaasha sainik rup se swatantra rahe
 In Eastern Iran, where the Samanis and then the Ghaznavis remained independent, the Saljuq Turks became powerful in the Central and West
 dharmayudhon ke samay bhi baghdad ne koi badi safalataa lene main naakaami dikhaai
 At the same time, the descendants of the Umayyads who were out of power formed a separate Khilafat in Spain in 929 which became the Islamic rival of Baghdad
 1258 main mongolon kii teji se badhati shakti ne baghdad ko haraa diya or shahar ko lut liya gaya
 Millions of people were killed and Islamic libraries were burned
 us samay mongol muslim nahin the lekin agle 100 saalon main ve muslim ban gaye
 The Abbasids held power in Baghdad until the thirteenth century
 par iran or uske aasapaas ke kshetron main abu islam ke prati bahut shraddha bhav tha or abbasiyon ke khilaaf rosh
 According to him, Abu was a true priest of Islam and Ali and Hussain were true officials of Islam
 is vishwaas ko maanane waalon ko shiya kaha gaya
 Ali Shia means the group of Ali
 in logon kii nazar main in logon ne sach kaa rasta apanaaya or inako shaskaon ne bahut sataaya
 Abu Islam also had to embrace the gallows after finding the right caliph for Islam
 uske saath bhi vahi hua jo ali yaa imam hossain ke saath hua
 Therefore, Shia with this view lived in Abbasid rule for many years which were Sunni
 inako samay samay par pratadit bhi kiya gaya
 Later in the fifteenth century, after the coming of Safawi rule, the Shia people were liberated from this persecution
 misr main islam kaa prachaar to ummayadon ke samay hi ho gaya tha
 The Arabs planned for empire expansion in Spain for the first time in 710
 dhire-dhire unke samrajya main spain ke uttari bhaag bhi aa gaye
 By the end of the tenth century it had become part of the Abbasi Khilafat
 isi samay tak sindh bhi arabon ke niyantran main aa gaya tha
 In 1095, Pope Arban II prepared the background of the Crusades
 isaiyon ne spain tathaa purvi kshetron main muslimon kaa muqabla kiya
 Many shrines, including Yeruselam, were redeemed from the dominion of the Muslims

 By the time Master Chiff reaches Keez, it is late and Kiz is completely under the control of the Floods

 The party won only 4 seats in the 2009 parliamentary election
 2014 ke sansadeey chunaav main dal ko maatr 1 siten mili There is some dispute over the date of establishment of CPI in the Communist movement
 khud bhakpa kaa maananaa he ki uskaa gathan 25 disambar 1925 ko kanpur main hui party congress main hua tha
 But the Communist Party of Marxist, which was formed after the partition of the party in 1964, believes that the party was formed in 1920
 makapa ke daawey ke anusaar bharat kii is sabase puraani communist party kaa gathan 17 oktober 1920 ko communist international kii duusari congress ke turant baad hua tha
 However, it can be said that since 1920 the process of formation of the party was going on and many groups also emerged in this regard
 lekin aupchaarik rup se 1925 main hi party kaa gathan hua
 Among its early leaders were Manvendra Nath Rai, Abani Mukherjee, Mohammad Ali and Shafiq Siddiqui

 Even before the CPI was formally formed, the British had filed a lawsuit against several active communists under the Kanpur Bolshevik conspiracy

 20 march 1929 ko bhakpa se jude bahut se mahatvapurn netaaon ko meerut shadyantra cese main giraftaar kar liya gaya
 As a result, the party became leaderless
 1933 main pramukh netaaon ke meerut shadyantra cese se reeha hone ke baad party kaa punargathan kiya gaya
 Its Central Committee was formed and in 1934 it was accepted as the Indian part of Communist International
 1934 main congress ke bheetar vampanthi rujhaan rakhane vaale netaaon ne congress socialist party kaa gathan kiya
 At the time of its formation, the CPI leaders called it 'social fascism'
 lekin comintern dwaara upniveshon main bhartiya rashtriya congress jaise dalon ke prati drushtikon badalane se bhakpa ke congress ke prati drushtikon main bhi badlaav aayaa
 Now the CPI began to consider Congress politics as progressive
 iske sadasyon ne congress kii vampanthi dhara arthath siespi kii sadsyta grahan kii
 During 1936–1937, mutual cooperation between the Socialists and Communists increased considerably
 janvari 1936 main siespi kii duusari congress main yah thisis sweekaar kii gayi ki marxvad-leninavaad ke aadhaar par ek sanyukt bhartiya socialist party kii sthapana kii aavashyaktaa he
 Likewise, many communists were included in the National Executive Committee formed after the Third Congress of CSP
 baharhaal, yah nazadiiki lambe samay tak nahin chal paayi
 In the Ramgarh session of the Congress in 1940, the CPI released a document titled 'proletarian Path'
 isamen yudgh ke kaaran aupniveshik rajya kii kamazor haalat kaa hawala dete hue uske kilaaf sashastr andolan chhedane kii baat kii
 Enraged by this one-sided announcement of the CPI, the CSP expelled the Communist members from his party
 is bich, dwitiya vishwa-yudgh main soviet union or britain ke sambandhon ke achche hone ke kaaran july, 1942 main is par lagi pabandi hataa di gayi
 It started opposing Congress's anti-colonial strategy
 isane 1942 ke bharat chodo andolan kii aalochana kii or subhash chandra bose kii tikhi ninda kii
 An important achievement of the CPI in this period was also that it had established its supremacy over the All India Trade Union Congress, the trade organization of the Congress
 bhakpa ne 1946 main hue prantiy chunaavon main bhagidaari kii lekin ise puure desh ke 1585 prantiy vidhansabha kii siton main se kul aath siton par jeet mili
 Since its formation till the independence of the country, there have been many ups and downs in CPI politics
 isane ek samay congress or mahatma gandhi ko pratikriyaavaadi kii sangya di
 He also worked closely with them and separated from them again and opposed their politics
 yah virodh is seemaa tak pahunch gaya ki unhone bharat chodo andolan ke samay british shashan kaa samarthan kar daalaa
 One of the main reasons behind this was that Indian conditions were given less importance in CPI politics
 adhikansh maukon par communist international yaa soviet union ke nirdeshon ne party kii ranneeti tay karne kaa kaam kiya
 Due to this many times its strategies moved in the opposite direction
 in gadabadiyon ke baavjood congress ke mazdoor sanghathan or desh ke kuch bhaagon main isaki sthiti kaafii majboot ho gayi thi
 Communists also played an important role in the Tebhaga movement in Bengal and the Telangana movement in Andhra Pradesh
 1946 main hue tebhaaga andolan main bengal ke jotdaaron ne is baat ke liye sangharsh kiya ki unke paas apni kheti ke utpaada kaa do-tihaai bhaag hona chahie
 The Kisan Morcha Kisan Sabha of the CPI played an important role in this movement
 kuch jagahon par yah andolan hinsak bhi ho gaya
 The movement was successful and the Muslim League government of the state enacted a law that landlords would not be given more than one-third of the total produce
 lekin yah kanoon sahi tareeke se lagu nahin hua
 The Telangana movement took place in Hyderabad Rajwada
 yahan andhra mahasabha ke binar tale hyderabad ke nizaam ke kilaaf pehle hi andolan chal rahaa tha
 Communists had a significant presence in the Andhra General Assembly
 inhone kisaanon ko nizaam or sthaneey zameendaaron ke kilaaf jaagruk banaaya
 In Nalgonda, Warangal and Khammam districts, farmers launched agitations for loan waiver, abolition of bonded labor and redistribution of land
 yah andolan 1945 main shuru hua or 1946 aate-aate isane kaafii jor pakad liya
 The Nizam's armies and zamindars were brutally repressed
 hazaron kisaanon kii hatya kar di gayi
 But the armed squads of the farmers fiercely countered this repression
 in daston kaa bahut se gaanvon par niyantran ho gaya or unhone vahaan bhoomi sudhaar kii nitiyon par amal kiya
 By 1948, he had liberated about 16,000 square miles of land in 3,000 villages and distributed it among the people of the village
 sitambar, 1948 main bhartiya sena ke dabil se nizaam ke shashan kaa ant ho gaya
 Despite this the peasant revolt continued
 bhartiya sena ne bhi iskaa hinsak daman kiya
 Eventually, the movement was officially withdrawn by the CPI in 1951
 iske baad yah andolan dhimaa padate hue khatm ho gaya
 Tebhaga and Telangana movement have significant importance in the history of Indian Left
 isane jamini str par communiston ke prabhaav ko dikhaaya
 Currently all groups of communists claim the legacy of these movements

 But it did not get enough support within the party

 Therefore, the CPI can try to capture power through the armed struggle of the workers throughout the nation by combining democratic and socialist phases

 This was called the 'andhra line'
 1948 kii kalakatta congress main randive line kii jeet hui
 But on the other hand, by allowing the armed suppression of the Telangana movement in India by the Nehru government and on the other hand the success of the Chinese Revolution, the 'andhra line' position in the party became stronger

 Joshi Khemé described such a move as leftist deviation

 After this, three documents were prepared

 Explaining the nature of Indian Burzwa, it was said that despite being primarily dependent on imperialist Burzwa, it has nationalist and non-cooperative elements
 iske baad madhyamargi netaa ajay ghosh ne party kii kaman sambhaali
 During this period the party recognized the independence of India and it was decided to participate in the elections, accepting the constitution
 pehle aam chunaavon main party kaa pradarshan bahut shandaar nahin mana ja saktaa, lekin loksabhaa main 16 siton par jeet hasil karke yah mukhya vipakshi dal ke rup main ubhari
 The CPI particularly focused on strengthening its position among the workers working in the organized sector
 iske mazdoor sanghathan ol india trade union congress kii mazaduron ke bich main acchhee paith thi
 But at that time it was difficult to challenge the dominance of Congress and Nehru in the politics of the country
 phir bhi bhakpa ne kuch rajyon main apni sthiti majboot kar lee
 The Congress again got a clear majority in the second general elections, but the CPI seats also increased
 in chunaavon main ise 27 loksabhaa kshetron main jeet mili

 The CPI government was formed under the leadership of Namboodiripad
 yah vishwa kii pehali chuni hui communist sarkaar thi
 But in 1959 the Nehru government dismissed it
 isse bhakpa ke ek dhade ke bheetar nehru ke prati kaafii naaraazgi paidaa ho gayi
 But the CPI activists were in a state of confusion at this time, because the Nehru government had a very good relationship with the Soviet Union
 soviet party kii yah apeksha thi ki bhakpa nehru sarkaar ke prati naram ravaiya apanaaye
 Meanwhile, such incidents took place at the international level due to which not only the international communist unity was affected, but the CPI was also divided
 saath kaa dashak aate-aate tak soviet union kii communist party or china kii communist party ke bich ke sambandh karaab hone lage
 The Communist Party of China accused the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of being a revisionist and had deviated from the path of marxism-leninism
 idhar china or bharat ke sambandh bhi kaafii karaab ho gayi
 The india-china war also took place in 1962 due to the border dispute
 bhakpa ke ek dhade ne bharat sarkaar kii niti kaa samarthan kiya
 At the same time another section of the party claimed that it is a confrontation between the socialist and the capitalist state
 asal main, bhakpa ke in dhadon kii ranneeti main antarrashtriya str par communiston ke bich chal rahi tanatani kii bhi mahatvapurn bhoomika rahi
 The pro-soviet faction of the CPI took forward the idea of cooperating with the ruling National Party of India at that time
 lekin bhakpa ke ek duusare dhade, jo aage chalakar makapa bani, ne ise 'varg-sahyog' ke sanshodhanavaadee vichaar kii sangya di
 It is noteworthy that CPI won 29 seats in India's third general elections
 bhakpa ab bhi sansad main congress ke baad duusari sabase badi party thi
 But within a party's camp, the belief was reinforced that the CPI was not spreading due to lack of a strict attitude towards the Nehru government
 ek samay ke baad yah takaraav kaafii bad gaya
 The CPI split in 1964 and a new party CPI (M) emerged
 bhakpa ke kai jujharu netaa masalan namboodiripad, jyoti basu, harkishan singh surajeet aadi makapa main shaamil ho gayi
 This had a negative impact on the CPI basis in states like West Bengal
 kerala main party ke vibhaajan ke shuruaati kuch dashakon tak bhakpa kaa bhi acha-khaasaa prabhaav rahaa
 Between 1970-77, the CPI formed an alliance with the Congress and formed a government with it in which C
 Achutha Menon of the CPI became the Chief Minister of the state
 iske baad, kisi rajya main bhakpa ko satta main aane kaa mauka nahin mila
 The CPI supported Indira Gandhi's Emergency imposed by Congress due to alliance with Congress during 1970-77 period
 lekin assi kaa dashak aate-aate makapa zyaada majboot communist party ban gayi
 The CPI has a good presence in many other parts of the country, but the CPI (M) has gone ahead due to a stronger presence in some areas
 1977 ke baad bhakpa ne makapa or duusari choti communist partiyon ke saath milakar vam morche kaa gathan kiya
 In practically all places, including Kerala, this party turned into a smaller ally of the CPI (M)
 adhikansh maukon par iskaa pradarshan vam morche ke pradarshan par nirbhar rahaa
 In the later nineties, the CPI has given considerable attention to strengthening the politics of secular and non-bjp, non-congress parties
 makapa ke netritv vaale vam morche ke saath milakar isane congress kii nav-udaaravaadi nitiyon kaa virodh kiya
 No party got a majority after the 1996 Lok Sabha elections
 sabase badi party bhaajapa kii sarkaar loksabhaa main apana bahumat sabit nahin kar paayi
 After this, HD a United Front government was formed under the leadership of Deve Gowda
 bhakpa ne ek aitihaasik faisalaa lete hue is sarkaar main shaamil hone kaa faisalaa kiya
 This decision was quite different from the decision of the CPI (M) which rejected the proposal to make Jyoti Basu the Prime Minister
 is tarah vam morche kaa bhaag hote hue bhi isane apni raajnneetik swytta pradarshit kii
 Its leaders joined the government of both the governments of the United Front and they held important ministries like Home Ministry and Agriculture Ministry
 sanyukt morche kii sarkaar ke patan ke baad centre main rajg kii sarkaar bani
 During the tenure of this government, the CPI played the role of responsible opposition as a constituent of the Left Front
 2004 sanyukt pragatisheel gathbandhan kii sarkaar ko vam morche ne samarthan diya
 It tried to ensure that this government works according to its minimum common program
 is dauraan bhakpa ne bhi sarkaar par kai janonmukhi kaarykram apnaane kaa dabaav banaaya
 Observers have generally believed that the Left Front pressure played an important role behind the very progressive and people-oriented laws enacted during the UPA-I government
 2008 main vam morche ne sanyukt rajya america se parmaanu samjhaute ke mudde par samprag sarkaar se samarthan waapas le liya
 The performance of the Left Front in the 2009 general elections was much worse than in the 2004 general elections
 iskaa kaaran tha ki pashchim bengal main vam morche ke pradarshan main aayi giravat
 In particular, in places like Singur and Nandigram, incidents of forced land acquisition by the state government and repression by use of force against it have severed the image of the Left Front
 iskaa asar bhakpa ke chunavi pradarshan par bhi padaa or ise loksabhaa main 2004 kii 10 kii tulana main sirf 4 siton par hi jeet mili
 Many limitations of CPI politics are now clear: First, the CPI has integrated itself into the politics of the Left Front in such a way that even on many serious issues it has not opposed the CPI-M more than a limit
 sirf kuch maukon par hi isane apni swaittata dikhaai he, lekin adhikansh masalon par isaki ranneeti vam morche kii ranneeti kaa bhaag hoti he
 Second, although the CPI (M) is in a very strong position in the three states of the country, the expansion of the CPI has been more in other parts of the country
 masalan, bihar, chhattisgarh, or tamilnadu jaise rajyon main bhi bhakpa kii majboot upasthiti rahi he
 But in states like Bihar, it has lost its base to a large extent, as it has now failed to prove its relevance in front of identity politics
 teesraa, bhakpa duusare sansadeey vampanthi dalon kii tarah hi naye kshetron main apana vistaar karne main naakaam rahi he
 It has become a stalled party in a way 
 yaa to yah kuch jagahon par apana aadhaar bachaane main safal rahi he, yaa us aadhaar ko bhi kho rahi he
 The CPI is not spreading in new areas
 1980 ke baad hue loksabhaa ke har chunaav main ise 15 se kam siton par hi jeet mili
 For example, in the 1980 parliamentary elections, 11 seats were won in 1984, 6 in 1989, 14 in 1991, 12 in 1996, 9 in 1998, 4 in 1999, 10 in 2004 and 4 seats in 2009
 chauthaa, yah bhi aarope lagaaya jaataa he ki bhakpa ne jamini str par sangharsh kii raajnneeti se munh mode liya he
 This criticism, however, cannot be taken as completely correct, because in areas where the CPI exists, it has fought a lot against state repression
 masalan, chhattisgarh ke dantewada jile main bhakpa ne rajya pryojit salwa judum abhiyaan kaa tikhaa pratirodh kiya
 Fifth, one of the grounds for criticism of CPI politics has been that it has fully accepted the democratic system of the capitalist state
 ab yah rashtravaadi ruparekha ke bheetar hi kaam kar rahi he or poonjeewaadi rajya ko ukhaad phenkane jaisi ranneeti isaki raajnneeti kaa bhaag nahin he
 However, despite these criticisms, it cannot be denied that the CPI has a long heritage in Indian politics
