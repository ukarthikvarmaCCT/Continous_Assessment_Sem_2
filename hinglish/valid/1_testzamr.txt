 In the Gupta period, the progress of the construction of temples is visible

 By the 7th century, the construction of temples with stones has been found in Aryan culture parts of the country
 chauthi se chhathi shatabdi main guptkaal main mandiron kaa nirmaan bahut drut gati se hua
 Originally the style of Hindu temples may have been derived from Buddhist temples, as in the old temples of that time, the idols were found to be placed in the center of the temple and had a circumambulatory path like Buddhist stupas
 guptakaleen bache hue lagbhag sabhi mandir apekshaakrit chote hai jinamein kaaphi motaa or majboot kaarigari kiya hua ek chota kendriya kaksh he, jo yaa to mukhya dwaar par yaa bhawan ke chaaron ore baraamde se yuddh he

 `vishwa bharti' vishvavidhyalay ke naam se prakhyat hua

 It is mostly issued by small, new companies that capitalize to grow their business
 Wants, but it can also be issued by large privately-owned companies who want to do business in the public market
 ipos are a way for companies to enter the stock market

 ipos can be a risky investment
 For individual investors, it is difficult to predict how the shares will perform in their early day trading and in the near future as they do not have enough data to analyze the company as well as most ipos
 Those companies which are going through a temporary development, so there is uncertainty in terms of their future value

 Common examples include: aamtaur par ek bade ipo kii hamidari nivesh bainkon ke kisi sanghathan ke dbaara kii jaati he, jiskaa netritv ek yaa adhik bade nivesh bank kar rahe hote hai sheyaron kii bikri par hamidaaron ko aadhat milti he jo beche gaye sheyaron ke mulya par aadhaarit hoti he aamtaur par, pramukh hamidaar yani vah hamidaar jinhon ne ipo ke sabase bade hisse beche hai, sabase zyada kamishan pate hai - kuch maamalon main 8 % tak
 In a multinational IPO, the issuer's company may have up to three organizations of underwriters to deal with different legal requirements to suit other markets
 For example, an EU issuing company is represented in its domestic market, Europe, The principal underwriting organization may
 anya bazaaron jaise america / canada or asia ke liye alag hamidaar sanghathan ho sakate hai aamtaur par, pramukh bazaar kaa pramukh hamidaar bank anya bazaaron main bhi company kaa pramukh hamidaar hota he
 Because of such broad legal requirements, ipos typically work with one or more law firms, such as Magic Circle Firms of London and White Shoe Firm of New York City aamtaur par, peshkash main nai poonji ekartrit karne ke liye nae sheyaron kaa nirgam evam maujuuda sheyaron kii anushanbee bikri shaamil hoti he
 However, most of the existing shares are subject to certain regulatory restrictions and restrictions imposed by key underwriters

 The issuer gives the hamidars an option to increase their offer up to 15% under certain circumstances, this is called green shoe or more allocation option

 Liberal stock can lead to early founders becoming millionaires overnight, employees can also make a lot of money
 Most ipos can be found on the Nasdaq stock market, which lists computer and information technology related companies
 But, relatively new and untested firms are large
 Despite the availability of large amount of financial resources, a large number of firms started falling into cash crisis
 The crisis was particularly in cases where the founding party had sold an important portion of its stake immediately after the atav issue of the IPO
 yah ghatana thi sanyukt rajya tak simit nahin thi
 In Japan, for example, a similar situation was presented
 kuch companiyon is tarah ho rahaa tha jaise ipo jari karnaa hi unka ekmaatr lakshya ho kuch share bazaar aisi hi companiyon ke liye sthapit kiye gaye the, jaise kii nasdac japan 
 Perhaps the most obvious bubbles in the history of the hot IPO market were in 1929 and 1989, when ipos of limited-term funds were sold at extremely large premiums
 If we compare the market value of limited-term funds to the value of the shares included in the fund
 Bubbles are seen when the market price is in multiples of the underlying value

 Underwriters were not pleased with this policy

 People's perception about the IPO may be controversial
 The IPO was a complete failure for the people who got it as much capital as possible
 It was important to note that there are different types of investors in an auction and in the open market - the auction was believed to be a complete success for those who were measuring the IPO by the benefits of devaluation to investors
 Institutions bid in and individual investors in the open market Google may be a special case but because many individual investors have recently issued ipo's for stock Mbi term buy to keep in mind ke value, aitihaasik taur par dekhen to america or vaishvik donon hi staron par ipo avamoolyit rahe hai ipo kaa praarambhik avamulyan, stock ke pehali baar kaarobaar main aate samay usame atirikt ruchi paidaa karne kaa kaam karata he yah un niveshkon ke liye ullekhneey laabh kaa strot ho saktaa he jinhen 'maangi keemat' par share mili hon haalanki, ipo kaa avamulyan karne par company ko us poonji ko tyaagna hota he jise vah stock ko unche mulya par vikray kar praapt kar sakati thi The risk of overvaluation is also an important consideration
 jab ek stock janata ko bazaar mulya se unche daam par prastut kiya jaataa he tab hamidaaron ko share bechney kii apni patibaddhta ko nibhaaen main mushkil ho sakati he agar vah saare share bech bhi lete hai tab bhi agar pehle din ke kaarobaar main stock girtaa he to vah vikray kshamta or maan kho saktaa he That's why investment banks value an IPO after taking many factors into consideration and want to reach an offer price that is low enough to arouse interest in the stock but sufficient to raise enough capital for the company Generally, in the process of determining the optimal price, the underwriters are required to buy shayaron from the major institutional investors

 teevr gyaan ke bal par mukti kii uplabdhi hona ek saamaanya sarvaparichit vyapaar he, parantu bhakthi kii prapti bhagavan kii keval krupa se hi saadhy hoti he
 There is a secret secret to the attraction of devotion rather than liberation
