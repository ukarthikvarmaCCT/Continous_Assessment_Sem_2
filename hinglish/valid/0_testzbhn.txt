 ve mantra, brahman or aaranyak-upanishad naamak bhaagon main vibhajit kiye gaye hai
 Being very ancient, the knowledge of Vedavakas meaning, experimentation and interrelationship was lost, and there was a need to research them
 mantra or brahman bhaagon ke antargat vaakyon kaa samanvay jaimini ne apane granth mimasaasutra main kiya
 Mantamsa, being a precursor to the Mantra and the Brahmana Veda, got its name and meaning of usage

 Uttara Mimamsa is also called bodily epistemology because it signifies the means and worships for the bodily soul through which he can experience his brahmastha
 iskaa naam vedant darshan is kaaran padaa ki isamen veda ke antim bhaag ke vaakyon ke vishyon kaa samanvay kiya gaya he
 It got its name Brahmamimamsa or Brahmasutra because the particular subject in it is Brahman and the metaphysics of its form, while the subject of Purvimamsa is Yajna and religious acts

 shankar ke pashchaat or aacharyon ne bhi apane-apane sampradaay ke maton kii pushti karne ke liye or apane maton ke anuroop brahmasutra par bhashya likhe
 The commentaries of Sri Ramanujacharya, Sri Madhvacharya, Sri Nimbarkacharya and Sri Vallabhacharya are noted
 in sab aacharyon ke mat, kuch anshon main samaan hote hue bhi, bahut kuch bhinn hai
 It is very difficult to say exactly what the views of Badrayana themselves are, and which Acharya's commentary supports and is favorable to the thoughts of Badrayana because the sources are very difficult
 is samasya ke saath yah samasya bhi sambhddha he ki jin upanishadvakyon kaa brahmasutra main samanvay karne kaa praytn kiya gaya he unke darshanik vichaar kya hai
 What did Badarayana think of him and what did the commentators think of him? The same commentary should be understood to be mostly correct which suits both the Upanishads and the Brahmasutras
 is drushti se shri shankaracharya kaa mat adhik samichin jaan padataa he
 Some scholars describe the opinion of Ramanujacharya as more favorable
 uttarmimasaa kaa sabase vishesh darshanik siddhant yah he ki jad jagat

 He was a sensitive writer, vigilant citizen, skilled speaker and sudhi editor

 After Premchand, the people who worked to advance literature with social concerns and progressive values include from Yashpal to Muktibodh
 premchand kaa janm 31 july 1880 ko varanasi ke nikat lamahi gaanv main hua tha
 His mother's name was Anandi Devi and father Munshi Ajayabarya was a postman in Lamhi
 unki shiksha kaa aarambh urdu, farsi se hua or jeevanyaapan kaa adhyaapan se padhane kaa shauk unhen bachapan se hi lag gaya

 He was influenced by the Arya Samaj, which was a major religious and social movement at that time

 They had three children - Sripat Rai, Amrit Rai and Kamala Devi Srivastava
 1910 main unki rachana soje-vatan ke liye hamirpur ke jila colector ne talab kiya or un par janata ko bhadakaane kaa aarope lagaaya
 All copies of Soje-watan were confiscated and destroyed
 colector ne nawabrai ko hidaayat di ki ab ve kuch bhi nahin likhenge, yadi likhaa to jail bhej diya jayega
 By this time Premchand used to write under the name Dhanpat Rai
 urdu main prakashit hone vaali zamana patrika ke sampadak or unke ajij dost munshi dayanarayan nigam ne unhen premchand naam se likhane kii salaah di

 "much of the discussion of Indian literature that emerged from prominence later, whether it is Dalit literature or women's literature, has its roots somewhere deep in Premchand's literature
 " premchand ke lekh 'pehali rachana' ke anusaar unki pehali rachana apane mamaa par likhaa vyangy thi, jo ab anuplabdh he
 His first available writing is his Urdu novel Asrar Maabid
 premchand kaa doosraa upanyaas 'hamakhurma va hamsawab' jiskaa hindi roopantaran 'prema' naam se 1907 main prakashit hua
 This was followed by Premchand's first story collection called soze-watan which was published in 1908
 soje-vatan yani desh kaa dard
 Fueled by patriotism, it was banned by the English government and warned its author not to do such writing in future
 iske kaaran unhen naam badalakar likhnaa padaa
 His first story titled 'premchand' was published in the December 1910 issue of Bada Ghar Ki Beti Zamana magazine
 maranoparant unki kahaniyaan maansarovar naam se 8 khandon main prakashit hui
 The story said that Emperor Premchand said that the litterateur is not the truth behind patriotism and politics, but rather the truth which shows the torch before him
 yah baat unke sahitya main ujagar hui he
 In 1921, he quit his job at the call of Mahatma Gandhi
 kuch maheene maryaada patrika kaa sampadan bhaar sambhala, chah saal tak maadhuri naamak patrika kaa sampadan kiya, 1930 main banaras se apana masik patr hans shuru kiya or 1932 ke aarambh main jaagran naamak ek saptahik or nikaala

 Wrote the story of a film titled Mazdoor, released in 1934, and without completing the year-long period of contract, escaped to Benares, leaving two months' salary because he did not like the air and water of the film world in Bombay and more
 unhone mul rup se hindi main 1915 se kahaniyaan likhnaa or 1918 se upanyaas likhnaa shuru kiya
 Premchand wrote a total of nearly three hundred stories, about a dozen novels and many articles
 unhone kuch naatak bhi likhe or kuch anuwaad kaary bhi kiya
 Many literary works of Premchand were translated into many languages including English, Russian, German
 godaan unki kaaljayi rachana he
 Kafan is believed to be his final story
 unhone hindi or urdu main puure adhikaar se likhaa
 Most of his compositions originally written in Urdu, but they went first publication was in Hindi
 taintis varshon ke rachanaatmak jivan main ve sahitya kii aisi viraasat saunp gaye jo gunon kii drushti se amuly he or aakaar kii drushti se aseemit
 Premchand's composition and vision came in various literary forms
 bahumukhi pratibha sampann premchand ne upanyaas, kahani, naatak, samiksha, lekh, sampadakeey, sansmaran aadi anek vidhaon main sahitya kii sristi kii
 He was prominently known as a storyteller and during his lifetime he was awarded the title of 'novel Emperor'
 unhone kul 15 upanyaas, 300 se kuch adhik kahaniyaan, 3 naatak, 10 anuwaad, 7 bal-pustaken tathaa hajaaron prishthon ke lekh, sampadakeey, bhaashan, bhoomika, patr aadi kii rachana kii lekin jo yash or pratishtha unhen upanyaas or kahaniyon se praapt hui, vah anya vidhaon se praapt na ho saki
 This situation appears equally in both Hindi and Urdu languages
 premchand ke upanyaas na keval hindi upanyaas sahitya main balki sampurna bhartiya sahitya main mile ke pathar hai
 Premchand first begins his novelist in fiction
 unka pehla urdu upanyaas ‘asaraare maaabid urf devsthan rahasy’ urdu saptahik ‘'aawaaj-e-khalq'’ main 8 oktober, 1903 se 1 farvari, 1905 tak dharawahik rup main prakashit hua
 His second novel 'hamkhurma aur Humswab', a Hindi adaptation of which was published in 1907 under the name 'prema'
 chunki premchand mul rup se urdu ke lekhak the or urdu se hindi main aae the, isliye unke sabhi aarambhik upanyaas mul rup se urdu main likhe gaye or baad main unka hindi tarjuma kiya gaya
 He entered the world of Hindi novel from the novel 'sevasadan'
 yah mul rup se unhone 'bajaare-husn' naam se pehle urdu main likhaa lekin iskaa hindi rup 'sevasadan' pehle prakashit karaayaa
 'sevasadan' is the story of a woman becoming a prostitute
 dow ramvilas sharma ke anusaar 'sevasadan' main vyakt mukhya samasya bhartiya nari kii paradheenata he
 After this came his first novel 'premashram' on peasant life
 iskaa masauda bhi pehle urdu main 'goshaae-aafiyat' naam se taiyaar hua tha lekin 'sevasadan' kii bhaanti ise pehle hindi main prakashit karaayaa
 'premashram' is probably the first novel in Hindi written on peasant life
 yah avadh ke kisaan andolanon ke daur main likhaa gaya
 After this, the journey through 'rangbhoomi', 'rejuvenation', 'nirmala', 'drone', 'karmabhoomi' was completed to 'godan'
 rangabhumi main premchand ek andhe bhikhaari surdaas ko katha kaa nayak banaakar hindi katha sahitya main krantikari badlaav kaa sutarapaat kar chuke the
 Godan has an important place not only in Hindi literature but also in world literature
 isamen premchand kii sahitya sambandhi vichaardhaara 'aadarshonmukh yatharthwaad' se 'aalochanatmak yatharthwaad' tak kii purnataa praapt karti he
 Creating a common peasant hero of the novel was like to change the course of the novel tradition
 samantvaad or poonjeevaad ke chakra main funskar hui kathanayake hori kii mrityu pathakon ke jahan ko jhakzor kar rakh jaati he
 In his previous novels 'premashram' and 'karmabhoomi' on peasant life, while presenting the Premchand reality, he embraces the ideal till the end of the novel
 lekin godaan kaa kaarunik ant is baat kaa gavaah he ki tab tak premchand kaa adarshavaad se mohabhang ho chukaa tha
 This can also be seen in his last period stories
 'mangalsutra' premchand kaa adhuraa upanyaas he
 The original story of Premchand's novels was Indian rural life
 premchand ne hindi upanyaas ko jo oonchaai pradaan kii, vah parvarti upanyaaskaaron ke liye ek chunauti bani rahi
 Premchand's novels were translated into many languages of India and the world, especially his most popular novel Godan
 inaki adhiktar kahaniyon main nimna va madhyam varg kaa chithran he
 Dr
 Kamalkishore Goenka has published the entire hindi-urdu story of Premchand under the name Premchand Kahani Rachnavali
 unke anusaar premchand ne kul 301 kahaniyaan likhi hai jinamein 3 abhi aprapya hai
 Premchand's first story collection titled Soze Vatan was published in June 1908
 isi sangrah kii pehali kahani duniya kaa sabase anmol ratan ko aam taur par unki pehali prakashit kahani mana jaataa rahaa he

 unke jivan kaal main kul nau kahani sangrah prakashit hue- 'sapt saroj', 'navnidhi', 'prempurnima', 'prem-pachisi', 'prem-pratimaa', 'prem-dwadashi', 'samaryatra', 'maansarovar' : bhaag ek va do or 'kafan'
 After his death, his stories were published in 8 parts titled 'mansarovar'
 premchand sahitya ke mudradhikaar se mukt hote hi vibhinn sampadakon or prakashkon ne premchand kii kahaniyon ke sankalan taiyaar kar prakashit karaae

 The problems of farmers, laborers, women, Dalits, etc
 have been depicted seriously in their stories

 His historical stories and love stories also proved to be quite popular
 premchand kii pramukh kahaniyon main ye naam liye ja sakate hai- 'panch parameshwar', 'gulli danda', 'do belon kii katha', 'idgah', 'bade bhai sahab', 'pus kii raat', 'kafan', 'thakur kaa kuan', 'sadgati', 'budhi kaaki', 'tawan', 'vidhwans', 'doodh kaa daam', 'mantra' aadi
 Popular stories of Premchand ji premchand ne 'sangram', 'karbala' or 'prem kii vedi' naatakon kii rachana kii
 These plays are good at the level of craftsmanship and compassion, but their stories and novels have attained such a height that Premchand did not get much success in the field of drama
 ye naatak vastutah sanvadatmak upanyaas hi ban gaye hai
 Premchand was not only a sensitive storyteller, but also a vigilant citizen and editor
 unhone 'hans', 'maadhuri', 'jaagran' aadi patr-patrikaon kaa sampadan karte hue va tatkaaleen anya sahagaami saahitiyik patrikaon 'chaand', 'maryaada', 'swadesh' aadi main apni saahitiyik va saamaajik chintaaon ko lekhon yaa nibandhon ke madhyam se abhivyakt kiya
 'premchand: Miscellaneous Context' edited by Amritrai is actually a compilation of Premchand's articles
 premchand ke lekh prakaashan santhaan se 'kuch vichaar' sheershak se bhi chape hai
 Premchand's famous writings include the following articles - Purpose of Literature, Old Age New Age, Benefits of Swaraj, Story Art, Some thoughts about the Qaumi language, Unity of hindi-urdu, Mahajani Civilization, Upanayas, Literature in life
 Location etc

 He also translated the works of writers of other languages whom he read and were influenced by
 'tollstoy kii kahaniyaan', galsvardi ke teen naatakon kaa 'hadtaal', 'chaandi kii dibiya' or 'nyaay' naam se anuwaad kiya
 The Hindi translation of 'fasan-e-azad', the Urdu novel of Ratannath Sarshar, by him, 'azad Katha' became very famous
 premachand urdu kaa sanskaar lekar hindi main aae the or hindi ke mahaan lekhak bane
 Gave Hindi its special idiom and openness
 kahani or upanyaas dono main ugantarkari parivartan kiye
 He established a strong urge for timeliness in literature
 aam aadmi ko unhone apni rachanaaon kaa vishay banaaya or uski samasyaon par khulkar kalam chalaate hue unhen sahitya ke nayakon ke pad par asin kiya
 Before Premchand, Hindi literature was entangled in the stories of the king-queen, the thrill
 premchand ne sahitya ko sachai ke dharaatal par utaara
 He brought out the truth of life and time
 ve sampradayikta, bhrashtachar, jameendaari, karjakhori, garibi, upniveshwaad par aaajeevan likhte rahe
 Most of Premchand's compositions tell the story of his poverty and poverty
 ye bhi galat nahin he ki ve aam bhartiya ke rachanaakaar the
 He became a hero in his creations, which Indian society deemed untouchable and disgusting
 unhone saral, sahaj or aam bol-chaal kii bhashaa kaa upyog kiya or apane pragatisheel vichaaron ko dridhtaa se tark dete hue samaaj ke saamne prastut kiya
 Presiding over the first conference of the Progressive Writers Association in 1936, he said that the writer is progressive by nature and he who is not, is not a writer
 premchand hindi sahitya ke yug pravartak hai
 He started a new tradition of idealistic realism in Hindi story
 itane mahaan rachanaakaar hone ke baavjood premchand kaa jivan aaropon se mukt nahin he
 Kamalkishore Goenka, a scholar of Premchand, in his book 'premchand: New Directions of Study', tried to reduce the importance of his literature by making some allegations on Premchand's life
 premchand par lage mukhya aarope hai- premchand ne apni pehali patni ko bina vajah choda or duusare vivaah ke baad bhi unke anya kisi mahila se sambandh rahe, premchand ne 'jaagran vivaad' main vinodashankar vyas ke saath dhokhaa kiya, premchand ne apni press ke varisht karmchaaree pravasilal verma ke saath dhokhaadhadi kii, premchand kii press main mazdooron ne hadtaal kii, premchand ne apni beti ke biimaar hone par jhaad-phoonk kaa sahaara liya aadi
 These allegations made by Kamalkishore Goenka do bring to us a side of Premchand's life, which reveals his human weaknesses but the evaluation of his extensive literature has no effect on these allegations
 premchand ko praayah "munshi premchand" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 When and how did 'munshi' become associated with Premchand's name? Most of the people in this subject believe that Premchand was a teacher in the beginning
 adhyapakon ko praaia: us samay munshi ji kaha jaataa tha
 Apart from this, there has been a tradition of putting the word 'munshi' as a form of honor before the names of Kayasthas
 sambhavat: premchand ji ke naam ke saath munshi shabd judakar rudh ho gaya
 According to Professor Shukdev Singh, Premchand never used the word 'munshi' himself in front of his name
 unka yah bhi maananaa he ki munshi shabd sammaan suchak he, jise premchand ke prashansakon ne kabhi laga diya hoga
 This fact is based on conjecture
 lekin premchand ke naam ke saath munshi visheshan judane kaa pramanik kaaran yah he ki 'hans' naamak patr premchand evam 'kanhaiyalaal munshi' ke sah sampadan main nikalataa tha
 On some copies of which Kanhaiyalal Munshi's full name was not printed, but 'munshi' was printed and also Premchand's name was printed in this way
 sampadakmunshi, premchand'hans ke sampadak premchand tathaa kanhaiyalaal munshi the
 But over time, the readers accepted 'munshi' and 'premchand' as one and became 'premchand' - 'munshi Premchand'
 yah swaabhaavik bhi he
 The general reader often reads the author's works, not seeing the subtlety of the name
 aaj premchand kaa munshi alankaran itnaa rudh ho gaya he ki maatr 'munshi' se hi premchand kaa bodh ho jaataa he tathaa 'munshi' na kehane se premchand kaa naam adhuraa-adhuraa sa lagata he
 Premchand did many experiments to reach the pinnacle of his art
 jis yug main premchand ne kalam uthaai thi, us samay unke peeche aisi koi thos viraasat nahin thi or na hi vichaar or pragatishiltaa kaa koi model hi unke saamne tha sivaay bangla sahitya ke
 At that time Bankim was Babu, Sharat Chandra and in addition there were Russian writers like Tolstoy
 lekin hote-hote unhone godaan jaise kaaljayi upanyaas kii rachana kii jo ki ek aadhunik clasik mana jaataa he
 He coined and shaped things himself
 jab bharat kaa swatantraaa andolan chal rahaa tha tab unhone katha sahitya dwaara hindi or urdu donon bhashaaon ko jo abhivyakti di usne siyaasi sargarmi ko, josh ko or andolan ko sabhi ko ubhaara or use taaqatvar banaaya or isse unka lekhan bhi taaqatvar hota gaya
 Premchand can certainly be called the first progressive writer of Hindi in this sense
 1936 main unhone pragatisheel lekhak sangh ke pehle sammelan ko sabhapati ke rup main sambodhan kiya tha
 His speech became the basis of the manifesto of the progressive movement
 premchand ne hindi main kahani kii ek parampara ko janm diya or ek puri peedi unke kadamon par aage badi, 50-60 ke dashak main renu, nagarjun auki inke baad shrinath singh ne gramin parivesh kii kahaniyaan likhi hai, wo ek tarah se premchand kii parampara ke taratamya main aati hai
 Premchand was a revolutionary creator, he saw not only patriotism but also many evil practices prevalent in the society and put them before the people through the story
 unhone us samay ke samaaj kii jo bhi samasyaayen thim un sabhi ko chitrit karne kii shuruyaat kar di thi
 Dalits also come in it, women also
 ye sabhi vishay aage chalakar hindi sahitya ke bade vimarsh bane

 This book was first published in 1944, but its importance in the field of literature can be gauged from the fact that it was revised and published again in 2005, the work was done by his grandson Prabodh Kumar

 aadim manushya anek kriyaaon or ghatnaon ke kaarnon ko nahin jaan paata tha
 He ignorantly understood that there is an invisible force behind them
 varsha, bijli, rog, bukamp, vrikshpaat, vipatti aadi agyaat tathaa agyeya dev, bhoot, pret or pishaachon ke prakope ke parinaam maane jate the
 Such thoughts did not dissolve even after the knowledge had become light, but these began to be considered superstitions
 adikaal main manushya kaa kriya kshetra sankuchit tha isliye andhvishwaason kii sankhya bhi alp thi
 As the human actions expanded, the web of superstitions also spread and many distinctions were discerned
 andhvishwaas sarvadeshik or saarvkalik hai
 They remain hidden even in the light of science
 abhi tak inkaa sarvatha uchdved nahin hua he
 In India, the roots of blind faith are very deep, Brahmin literature has a major contribution in it
 andhvishwaason kaa sarvasammat vargeekaran sambhav nahin he
 Naming them is also difficult
 prithvi sheshnag par sthit he, varsha, garjan or bijli indra kii kriyaayein hai, bukamp kii adhishthatri ek devi he, rogon ke kaaran pret or pishaach hai, is prakaar ke andhvishwaason ko pragvaigyanik yaa dharmik andhvishwaas kaha ja saktaa he
 The second major class of superstitions is the mantra-tantra
 is varg ke bhi anek upbhed hai
 The main differences are disease prevention, captivating, elevation, mortar etc
 vividh uddeshyon ke purtyrth mantra prayog pracheen tathaa madhya kaal main sarvatra prachlit tha
 Disease prevention was the business of many people
 virdohi or udasin vyakti ko apane vash main karnaa yaa dusron ke vash main karwaanaa mantra dwaara sambhav mana jaataa tha
 Uchhatan and Maran were also the subjects of the mantra
 mantra kaa vyavsaay karne vaale do prakaar ke hote the-mantra main vishwaas karne vaale or dusron ko thagne ke liye mantra prayog karne vaale
 Witchcraft, Shakun, Muhurta, Mani, Amulets etc
 are the children of superstition
 in sabake antstal main kuch dharmik bhav hai, parantu in bhaavon kaa vishleshan nahin ho saktaa
 There is irrational belief in them
 madhya yug main yah vishwaas prachlit tha ki aisa koi kaam nahin he jo mantra dwaara siddh na ho saktaa ho
 Failures were considered to be exceptions
 isliye krishi raksha, durgaraksha, rog nivaaran, santatilabh, shatru vinaash, aayu vruddhi aadi ke hetu mantra prayog, jaadu-tona, muhoort or mani kaa bhi prayog prachlit tha
 The gem is made of metal, wood or leaf and is tied on the throat or arm by writing a mantra on it
 isko mantra se siddh kiya jaataa he or kabhi-kabhi iskaa devtaa kii bhanti aavahan kiya jaataa he
 Its purpose is self-defense and evil prevention
 yogini, shakini or daakini sambandhi vishwaas bhi mantra vishwaas kaa hi vistaar he
 Laws about Dakini remained in England and Europe until the 17th century
 yogini bhootyoni main maani jaati he
 It is believed that it can be controlled by mantra
 phir mantra purush isse anek dushkar or vicitra kaary karvaa saktaa he
 This belief is prevalent about the phantom
 falit jyotish kaa aadhaar ganit bhi he
 Therefore, it is not all superstition
 shakun kaa andhvishwaas main samavesh ho saktaa he
 Many superstitions have also taken the form of stereotypes
 marxvaadi drushtikon main andhvishwaas vah vichaar paddati he jise aamtaur par dharamshastreey tathaa burjua sahitya main sachhee aasthaa ke mukaable rakhaa jaataa he jo aadim jaadu se judaa hota he
 From the point of view of the followers of any religion, the doctrines and rituals of other religions fall under the category of superstition
 marxvaadi nirishwarwad dharmik aasthaa tathaa kisi bhi tarah ke andhvishwaas ko purnatah asweekaar karata he

 bhoj panvar yaa parmaar vansh ke nawein raja the
 Parmar dynastic kings ruled from Malwa's capital Dharanagri from the eighth century to the first half of the fourteenth century
 bhoj ne bahut se yuddh kiye or apni pratishtha sthapit kii jisase siddh hota he ki unamem asaadhaaran yogyata thi
 Although most of his life was spent on the battlefield, he did not allow any kind of hindrance in the progress of his kingdom
 unhone malwa ke nagaron va graamon main bahut se mandir banawaye, yadhyapi unamem se ab bahut kam kaa pataa chalata he
 It is said that the capital of present-day Madhya Pradesh was settled by Raja Bhoj, then its name was Bhojpal Nagar, which later became Bhupal and then Bhopal
 raja bhoj ne bhopal nagar ke paas hi ek samudr ke samaan vishaal talab kaa nirmaan karaayaa tha, jo purv or dakshin main bhojpur ke vishaal shiv mandir tak jaataa tha
 Even today, on the way to Bhojpur, near the Shiv temple, a huge sail made of stones of that pond is seen
 us samay us talab kaa pani bahut pavitra or bimariyon ko thik karne vaala mana jaataa tha
 It is said that Raja Bhoj had a skin disease when a sage or a Vaidya advised him to bathe and drink in the water of this pond, which cured his skin
 us vishaal talab ke pani se shivmandir main sthapit vishaal shivlinga kaa abhishek bhi kiya jaataa tha
 Raja Bhoj himself was a very great scholar and he is said to have written books on various subjects such as religion, astronomy, art, lexicography, building construction, poetry, pharmacology etc
 which still exist
 inke samay main kaviyon ko rajya se aashray mila tha
 He ruled from 1000 AD to 1055 AD
 inaki vidwata ke kaaran janamanas main ek kahawat prachlit hui kahan raja bhoj kahan gangu taili
 Bhoja was very brave, majestic, and virtuous
 inhone anek deshon par vijay praapt kii thi or kai vishyon ke anek granthon kaa nirmaan kiya tha
 He was a very good poet, philosopher and astrologer
 saraswatikanthabharan, shringarmanjari, champuramayana, charucharya, tatvaprakash, vyavaharasamucchy aadi anek granth inke likhe hue batalaaye jate hai
 His meeting was always decorated with great priests
 inaki patni kaa naam leelavati tha jo bahut badi vidhushi thi
 When the banquet was alive it was said- he; saraswati ko sadaa aalamb mila hua he; sabhi pandit aadrut hai
 ) jab unka dehant hua to kaha gaya - Raja Bhoj was the son of Munj's younger brother Sindhuraj
 rohak inkaa pradhan mantri or bhuvanpaal mantri tha
 Kulachandra, Sadi and Taraditya were his commanders, with whose help Bhoja handled the operations smoothly
 apane chachaa munj kii hi bhanti yah bhi pashchimi bharat main ek samrajya sthapit karnaa chaahate the or is ichha kii purti ke liye inhen apane padosi rajyon se har disha main yuddh karnaa padaa
 Parmar was very agitated after Munj died in a mourning situation and hence Parmar was inspired by the Bhoj Chalukyas to march south with the idea of revenge lane
 unhone ne daahal ke kalburi gangeyadev tathaa thanjore ke rajendra chol se sandhi kii ore saath hi saath dakshin par akraman bhi kar diya, parantu tatkaaleen raja chalukya jaisingh dwitiya ne bahaduree se saamana kiya or apana rajya bachaa liya
 Sometime after 1044 AD, Someshwar II, the son of Jai Singh again turned hostile to the Paramaras and attacked the Malwa kingdom and forced Bhoja to flee
 dharanagari par adhikaar kar lene ke baad usne aag laga di, parantu kuch hi dinon baad someshwar ne maalav chhod diya or bhoj ne rajdhani main lotakar phir sattadhikaar praapt kar liya
 Shortly before 1018 AD, Bhoja defeated a person named Indaratha, possibly a feudatory of the Gang kings of Kalinga
 jaisingh dwitiya tathaa indrarath ke saath yuddh samaapt kar lene par bhoj ne apni sena bharat kii pashchimi seemaa se lage hue deshon kii ore badhaai or pehle laat naamak rajya par, jiskaa vistaar dakshin main bombai rajya ke antargat surat tak tha, akraman kar diya
 King Chalukya Kirtiraj surrendered there and Bhoja held the authority for some time
 iske baad lagbhag san 1020 i
 main bhoj ne laat ke dakshin main sthit tathaa thana jile se lekar malagaar samudratat tak vistrut konkan par akraman kiya or shilaharon ke arikeshari naamak raja ko haraaya
 The Konkan were annexed into the kingdom of Paramaras and the Shilahars as their feudatories reigned here for some time
 san 1008 i
 main jab mahmud gazanabi ne punjabe shahi naamak rajya par akraman kiya, bhoj ne bharat ke anya rajyon ke saath apni sena bhi akramanakari kaa virodh karne tathaa shahi anandapal kii sahaayta karne ke hetu bheji parantu hindu raajaaon ke is mail kaa koi fal na niklaa or is avasar par unki haar ho gai
 In 1043 AD, Bhoja sent his fellow soldiers to the king of Delhi to fight against the Muslims of Punjab
 us samay punjab gazani samrajya kaa hi ek bhaag tha or mahmud ke vanshaj hi vahaan rajya kar rahe the
 The Raja of Delhi got help from other parts of India and he traveled towards Punjab and defeated the Muslims and occupied some part of that country for a few days but in the end the king of Ghazni defeated him and lost the lost part again in his empire
 Got it
 bhoj ne ek baar daahal ke kalchuri gangeyadev ke viruddh bhi chadhaai kar di jisane dakshin par akraman karne ke samay uskaa saath diya tha
 Ganga Deva lost but did not have to surrender
 san 1055 i
 ke kuch hi pehle gangey ke putr karn ne gujarat ke chaulukya bhim pratham ke saath ek sandhi kar lee or maalav par purv tathaa pashchim kii ore se akraman kar diya
 Bhoja was making arrangements to save his kingdom that he died suddenly due to illness and the state easily went to the invaders
 uttar main bhoj ne chandelon ke desh par bhi akraman kiya tha jahaan vidyadhar naamak raja rajya karata tha
 But there was no benefit from it
 bhoj ke gwalior par vijay praapt karne ke praytn kaa bhi koi acha fal na hua kyonki vahaan ke raja kachchapaghat kirtiraj ne uske akraman kaa datakar saamana kiya
 It is believed that Bhoja had also conquered Kannauj for some time during the post-transformation period of the decline of Pratiharas
 bhoj ne rajasthan main shakambhari ke chaahamanon ke viruddh bhi yuddh kii ghoshnaa kii or tatkaaleen raja chaahmaan veeryaram ko haraaya
 He then threatened to win a kingdom called Shalit Nadul by the Anhil of the family of Chahmanas, but Parmar was defeated in the war and his chief commander-in-law, Sadi, lost his life
 bhoj ne gujarat ke chaulukyon se bhi, jinhone apni rajdhani anhilapattan main banaai thi, bahut dinon tak yuddh kiya
 Chamudaraja, son of Chalukya Solanki King Moolraj I, had to be humiliated by the arms of Parmar Bhoja in Malwa while going to Varanasi
 uske putr evam uttaradhikari ballabhraj ko isapar bada krodh aayaa or usne is apmaan kaa badla lene kii sochi
 He prepared a large army against Bhoja and attacked Bhoja, but unfortunately he died of smallpox on the way
 iske baad vallabhraj ke chote bhai durlabhraj ne satta kii bagdor apan haathon main lee
 After some time, the BJP also defeated him in the war
 durlabhraj ke uttaradhikari bhim ke rajyakaal main bhoj ne apane senapati kulchandra ko gujarat ke viruddh yuddh karne ke liye bheja
 Kulchandra conquered the entire region and looted his capital Anhilapattan
 bhim ne ek baar abu par akraman kar uske raja parmaar dhandu ko haraaya tha, jab use bhagkar chitrakoot main bhoj kii sharan leni padi thi
 As mentioned above, shortly before 1055 AD, Bhima attacked Malwa by entering into a treaty with Kalachuri Karna, but he could not get possession of that region during the banquet

 Judicial pre-judgment has a substantial importance as a source of law
 babylonia main 2000 i0 pus0 bhi nyayalain nirnay ko abhilikhit kiye jane kii paripati prachlit thi taaki kanoonee paraamarsh ke liye inaki sahaayta lee ja sake
 Under Roman jurisprudence, judges were instructed to follow pre-judgments given by eminent jurists in cases

 But in some cases in English law, pre-judgments have binding effect, that is, it is mandatory for judges to follow pre-judgments in promises of similar cases
 samand ke anusaar nyaayik purv-nirnay nyaayalay dwaara diya gaya aisa nirnay he jisamen vidhi kaa koi siddhanth nihit hota he
 The principle underlying pre-judgment which gives him authoritative element is called 'decision-base' in the legislative language
 aise thos nirnay sambandhit pakshakaron par bandhkaari prabhaav rakhte hai tathaa in nirnyon ke aadhaar ko vidhi ke rup main sweekaar kiya jaataa he
 In other words, judicial pre-judgments are principles laid down by the court that are to be implemented in future similar judgments to come before the court
 ullekhneey he ki sabhi nyaayik nirnay purv-nirnay kaa rup dhaaran nahin karte balki keval aise nirnay hi purvokti kaa mahatv rakhte hai jo kisi naye niyam yaa vidhi-siddhanth kaa pratipaadan karte hon
 Professor Goodhart has criticized the doctrine of the judgment of Samund, writing that virtually every principle propounded by the court cannot be a decision-base either because it is too broad or too narrow
 atah nirnay ke kisi vishisht bhaag ko uddhrut karke use vinishchay-aadhaar kahana anuchit hoga
 In Goodhart's view, the conclusion made by judges on the basis of the facts of a case is the basis of the decision
 unka kahana he ki kisi purvavarti nirnay kaa nirnyaadhar hi nyaayadhishon dwaara pashchaatvarti nirnyon main lagu kiya janaa chaiye
 This judicial decision, which is the basis of decision in subsequent promises, has the power of law for the future

 The assertion made by a judge in a judgment may be exemplary to other judges and will have binding effect on subordinate courts and thus indirectly take the form of 'law'

 Jeremy Bentham called the pre-judgment 'judges-made rule' while Austin considered such rules to be 'the judiciary's law'
 purv-nirnay ke sambandh main apane vichaar vyakt karte hue blackstone ne kaha he ki purvavarti nirnyon ke prayog dwaara nyaay kii taraazoo santulit tathaa sthir bani rahati hai
 With the appointment of new judges, no new changes can be brought in the law
 jo bate pehle anishchit raheen hai, ve nyaayik purv-nirnay ke dwaara vinishchit ho jaati he
 Blackstone's argument has also been endorsed by Dr
 Carter, an American scholar
 kiton ke anusaar nyaayik purv-nirnay nyaayalay dwaara diye gayi i se nyaayik vinishchay hai jinhen kisi prakaran main nirnay dene ke liye aadhaar banaaya jaataa he
 Therefore, they have been called 'judges'
 vikhyath amareeki nyayavid benzmin caradojo ne bhi purv-nirnay ko vidhi ke strot ke rup main sweekaar kiya he kintu ve iskaa kattarta se paalan kiye jane ke paksh main nahin hai kyonki nyaaypithon main nirantar parivartan hote rahane ke kaaran unke dwaara diye gayi nirnay ko bandhankaree prabhaav dena anek vyaavhaarik kathinaaiyaan utpann kar saktaa he
 In short, it can be said that pre-judgment is a directive that can be the basis of future decision
 yah ek upaay he jiskaa nirantar upyog kiya jaataa he or jo vidhi main vyapak rup se prayukt hota he
 It is noteworthy that enforcement of pre-judgment is based on the legal presumption of correctness of judicial decisions
 ek baar vinishchit maamla sadaiv ke liye vinishchit mana jaataa he
 What is said in a decision is an established truth
 jab tak kisi ucchtar nyaayalay dwaara kisi vinishchiya ko palat nahin diya jaataa, tab tak purv-nirnay ko chunauti nahin di ja sakati he
 If there is any objection in this matter, it can be decided by filing an appeal in the higher court
 nirnitanusaran kaa siddhanth english vidhi kaa ek sarvamaanya siddhanth he
 According to this theory, pre-decisions are authoritative and binding and it is mandatory to follow them
 jab anek nirnyon dwaara kisi vaidhanik prashn ko spashtatya sunishchit kar diya jaataa he, to uskaa anusaran karne tathaa use na badalane ke siddhanth ko nirnyanusaran kaa siddhanth kehete hai
