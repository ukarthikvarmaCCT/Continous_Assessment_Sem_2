 Jayadayal Goindaka was the exclusive preacher of the Srimad Bhagavad Gita
 ve gitapress, gita-bhawan, rishikul brahmacharyashram aadi ke sansthaapak the
 Jayadayal Goindka was born in Churu, Rajasthan on the evening of Jyeshtha Krishna 6, 1942 in the family of Shri Khubchandra Agarwal
 baalyavastha main hi inhen gita tathaa ramcharitamanas ne prabhavit kiya
 He moved to Bankura for the purpose of doing business with his family
 bengal main durbhiksh padaa to, unhone peediton kii seva kaa adarsh upasthit kiya
 After deep study of the Gita and other religious texts, he resolved to devote his life to preaching
 inhone kolkata main "govind-bhawan" kii sthapana kii
 He was so effective in discourse on the Gita that thousands of listeners used to take advantage of the satsang by being spell-bound
 "gita-prachaar" abhiyaan ke dauraan unhone dekha ki gita kii shuddh prati milani dubhar he
 He established the Gita Press in Gorakhpur in 1923 with the aim of publishing the Gita in pure language
 unheen dinon unke mausere bhai hanuman prasad poddar unke sampark main aae tathaa ve gita press ke liye samarpit ho gaye
 Publication of the magazine "kalyan" started from Geeta Press
 unke gita tathaa parmarth sambandhi lekh prakashit hone lage
 He commented on the Gita under the name "gita Tattva Vivechani"
 unke dwaara rachit tatv chintamani, prem bhakthi prakaash, manushya jivan kii safalataa, param shanti kaa maarg, gyaan yoga, prem yoga kaa tatv, param-saadhan, parmarth patrawali aadi pustakon ne dharmik-sahitya kii abhivruddhi main abhootpurv yogadan kiya he
 He died on 17 April 1965 on the banks of the Ganges in Rishikesh

 sethji vyapaar kaaryse kolkata jate the or vahaan janaper satsang karavaate the
 Sethji and Satsang were synonymous with each other for life
 sethjico yaa satsangiyonko jab bhi samay miltaa satsang shuru ho jaataa
 Many times, satsang lovers from Kolkata would come to Kharagpur and from Sethji Chakradharpur to Kharagpur, which used to fall between the two cities
 vahaan stesan ke paas raatbhar satsang hota, praat: sab apane-apane stando laut jate
 There was neither a stage nor publicity for Satsang like nowadays
 kolkatamein dukanki gaddiyonper hi satsang hone lagata
 The number of Satsangi brothers started increasing by the day
 dukanki gaddiyonmen sthaan simit tha
 The search for the big place started
 pehle to kolkatake eden gardenke peeche kileke sameep vaala sthal chunaa gaya lekin vahaan satsang thikse nahin ho paata tha
 Again around 1920, a warehouse of the Birla family was found on rent in the Basantalla street of Kolkata and it was named as Govind Bhavan
 vartmaanamen mahatma gandhi rodpar ek bhavy bhawan ‘govind-bhawan’ ke namase he jahanper nity bhajan-kirthan chalata he tathaa samay-samayper sant-mahatmaondvaara pravachanki vyavastha hoti he
 The wholesale and retail sale of books as well as handmade garments, Kanchi bangles, Ayurvedic medicines etc
 are being sold at reasonable prices
 kolkatamein shri sethji ke satsangke prabhavase saadhakonka samooh badhata gaya or sabhiiko swadhyaayke liye gitajiki aavashyaktaa hui, parantu shuddh paath or sahi arthki gita sulabh nahin ho rahi thi
 In order to get such a Gita with ease, Sethjean himself prepared five thousand copies from the Press of Kolkata on behalf of Govind Bhavan, by preparing the verse, meaning and short commentary
 yah pratham sanskaran bahut sheeghra samaapt ho gaya
 The next edition of six thousand copies was reprinted from the same forest press
 kolkatamein kul gyaarah hajaar pratiyaan chhapin
 But this printing faced many difficulties
 pustakonmen na to aavashyak sanshodhan kar sakate the, na hi sanshodhanake liye samuchit suvidha milti thi
 The machine had to stop and revise repeatedly
 aisi cheshtaa karneper bhi bhuulonka sarvatha abhaav na ho sakaa
 Then the owners of the press, who were themselves Sethji's satsangi, said to Sethji - it is not favorable for a businessman to improve by stopping the machine again and again
 aap jaisi shuddh pustak chaahate hai, waisi apane nijee pressmen hi chapana sambhav he
 Sethji used to say that in our books, to forget the Gita ji is to leave the wounds with a knife and to repair them is to put an ointment on the wound
 jo hamaara premi ho use pustakonmen ashuddhi sudhaar karneki bharsak cheshtaa kerani chaiye
 Sethji thought that one of his presses should be separate, so that the Gita-lovers could get the pure text and the true meaning of the Gita
 iske liye ek press gorakhpuramein ek chota-sa makaan lekar lagbhag 10 rupeke kirayaper baishakh shukla 13, ravivaar, vi
 san
 1980 ko gorakhpuramein presski sthapana hui, uskaa naam gitapress rakhaa gaya
 With this, Gitaji's printing and publishing became very convenient
 gitajike anek prakaarake chote-bade sanskarnake atirikt shrisethjiki kuch anya pustakonka bhi prakaashan hone laga
 The credit of sending the pure printed Gita, Kalyan, Bhagavata, Mahabharata, Ramcharitmanas and other religious texts to the public at affordable prices from gitapress is to Shree Jayadayalji Goindka
 gitapress pustakonko chhapaneka maatr press hi nahin he apitu bhagwaan kii vanise ni:sruth jeevanoddharak gita ityadiki prachaarsthali honese punyasthalimen parivartit he
 God himself proclaimed it in the scriptures that i would never give up the place where my name is remembered, preached, bhajan-kirtan etc
 gitaji ke prachaarke saath hi saath sethji bhagwatprapti hetu satsang karte hi rahete the
 He felt the need for a peace-loving place where there was no uproar, a holy land, and much needed material was available for instruments and hymns
 is aavashyaktaaki purtike liye uttrakhandki pavitra bhumiper san 1918 ke aasapaas satsang karne hetu sethji padhaare
 There Sethji found ultimate comfort in the place of Vatavriksha and present Geetabhavan on the banks of Gangapar Bhagwati Ganges
 suna jaataa he ki vatvriksh vaale sthanper swami ramtirthane bhi tapasya kii thi
 What was it then? Since 1925, Sethji, along with his satsangis, lived there for about 3 months every summer
 praat: 4 bajese raatri 10 bajetak bhojan, sandhyaa-vandan adike samayko chhodkar sabhi samay logonke saath bhagwat-charchaa, bhajan-kirthan aadi chalata rahata tha
 Gradually, pucca houses started being built for the satsangi brothers
 bhagawatkripase aaj vahaan kai suvyavasthit evam bhavy bhawan banakar taiyaar ho gayi hai jinamein 1,000 se adhik kamare hai or satsang, bhajan-kirtanke sthaan alag se hai
 Which have been free for the satsangis since the beginning
 yahan aakar log gangajike suramya vaataavaranamen baithkar bhagwat-chintan tathaa satsang karte hai
 This is the land where every year no one knows how many brothers and sisters have become free by living in the company of Sethji
 yahan aate hi jo anandanubhuti hoti he vah akathaneey he
 There is no inconvenience to those who come here; Because free housing and reasonably priced food and ration, utensils etc
 are available
 jaidayalji goyandakane is awasaiya vidhyalyaki sthapana isi uddeshyse kii ki bachapanse hi achche sanskaar bacchonmen paden or ve samajamen charitravan, kartavyanishth, gyanvan tathaa bhagwatprapti prayasi hon
 Since the year 1924, education, clothing, teaching materials, etc
 have been free till date
 unase bhojan kharch bhi nammatraka hi liya jaataa he
 Jayadayalji Goendka took great care of purity

 The Stephon Volzmann law, also known as the Stephon law, is a relation that describes the power depicted by the black body in terms of heat

 This rule was formulated in 1879 on the basis of experimental tests made by Joseph Steffon by John Tyndall and Ludwig Boltzmann made a theoretical analysis in 1884 using thermodynamics
 steffon ne apane niyam kii sahaayta se surya kaa prishthiya taap gyaat kiya
 He found from the data of Charles Soret that the density of energy from the sun is 29 times greater than the plate heated to a certain temperature
 ek gol patalika prekshan yantra se kuch duuri par is tarah se rakhaa gaya ki yah surya ke samaan kone par dikhaai de
 Soret estimated the temperature of the plate at around 1900 ° c to 2000 ° C
