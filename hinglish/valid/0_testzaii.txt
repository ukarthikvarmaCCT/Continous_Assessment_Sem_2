 The Pakistani dominion was established after the partition of British India under the Indian Independence Act 1947, allegedly for the Muslim population of the Indian subcontinent
 esaki kul bhubhag maujuuda islamic ganraajya pakistan va bangladesh ke baraabar thi
 With the implementation of the first constitution of Pakistan in 1956, the "dominion of Pakistan" was replaced when the official democratic system was replaced by the Islamic Republic

 Such a system remains in all British-autonomous investments

 After the Partition and Independence of India, the membership of British India in the United Nations was given to the Indian dominion while Pakistan gained new membership

 Its territory consisted of five provinces of British-ruled India: East Bengal, Western Punjab, Balochistan, Sindh and the north-west Frontier Province

 At the same time some princely states also accepted the proposal to join the Pakistani treaty

 The establishment of Pakistan was the result of the Pakistan Movement, which was led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, for the so-called Muslim population of the Indian subcontinent

 The infamous and controversial Radcliffe Line was the line which was considered by both sides as the international border between the Republic of India and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan

 In the year 1953, Queen Elizabeth II inherited the kingdom and crown of the United Kingdom and other British autonomous investments from her father George VI

 With the implementation of the first constitution of Pakistan in 1956, the dominion of Pakistan was established and Pakistan was declared an Islamic Republic
 pakistan adhirajya mul rup se ek swyttyopaniveshi prashasnic pranali thi jo british rashtramandal pradesh kaa hissaa tha evam british samrajya kaa ek adhirajya tha
 In the official monarchical system, all autonomous investments have only one king and only one house, that is, all the kingdoms are ruled by a single person
 yah naresh, har ek adhirajya par saamaanya adhikaar rakhata he evam har adhirajya main sanvaidhanik va kanuunan rup se use rashtradhyaksh kaa darja praapt hota he
 Despite this, all dominions remain independent and factually independent, because every country has its own independent government and the king's office is only traditional and narrative

 Such a system can be seen meaningfully in the British Empire and british-commonwealth territories and in the governance system of the former British overlords

 The movement for the creation of the Jan Lokpal Bill began in its all-india form on 5 April 2011 with a hunger strike by social activist Anna Hazare and his comrades at Jantar Mantar, including Magsaysay Award winner Arvind Kejriwal, India's first woman Administrative officer Kiran Bedi, famous folkloric lawyer Prashant Bhushan, Baba Ramdev, founder of Patanjali Yogpeeth were included
 sanchaar sadhano ke prabhaav ke kaaran is anshan kaa prabhaav samooche bharat main fail gaya or iske samarthan main log sadakon par bhi utarane lage
 He had demanded the Government of India to form a strong anti-corruption Lokpal Bill and had also given a draft of the Lokpal Bill to the Government in accordance with his demand
 kintu manmohan singh ke netritv vaali tatkaaleen sarkaar ne iske prati nakaaratmak ravaiya dikhaaya or isaki upeksha kii
 As a result, his attitude towards the fast started also remained neglected
 kintu is anshan ke andolan kaa rup lene par bharat sarkaar ne aanan-fanan main ek samiti banaakar sambhavit khatre ko taala or 16 agast tak sansad main lokapal vidheyak paas karaane kii baat sweekaar kar lee
 The bill presented by the government in the monsoon session beginning in August was weak and completely opposite to the Jan Lokpal
 anna hajaare ne iske khilaaf apane purv ghoshit tithi 16 agast se punah anshan par jane kii baat duharai
 The government stuck many obstacles in its path and arrested Anna Hazare and his associates on 16 August
 kintu isse andolan pure desh main bhadak uthaa
 a large number of dharnas, demonstrations and fasts were organized continuously for the next 12 hearts across the country
 antat sansad dwaara anna kii teen sharton par sahamati kaa prastaav paas karne ke baad 28 agast ko anna ne apana anshan sthagit karne kii ghoshnaa kii
 Anna Hazare started a fast unto death on 5 April 2011 in protest against government inaction demanding the creation of a strong Lokpal Bill
 bhrashtachar ke khilaaf unki is muhim main arvind kejariwal, kiran bedi, prashanth bhushan, baba ramdev evam anya anek prasiddh samajasevi shaamil the
 The government continued to neglect it
 is anshan ko bharat evam sheeghra hi vishwa ke sanchaar madhyamon main vistrut rup se prakashit or prasaarit kiya jane laga
 This ongoing effort against corruption soon got widespread public support
 bharat ke praayah sabhi shaharon main yuva sadakon par utar aae evam iske samarthan main pradarshan kiya tathaa parche baante
 Concerned over the spread of Anna Hazare's fast as a nationwide mass movement, the government immediately announced a committee to draft the Jan Lokpal Bill
 usne 16 agast se pehle sansad main ek majboot lokapal vidheyak paas karaane par bhi sahmati prakat kar di
 In this way, this fast came to an end and the mass movement that flourished against corruption ended with the hope of building a strong Lokpal
 kintu sarkari manshaa sandigdh thi isliye anna hajaare ne saath hi ghoshnaa kii ki yadi aagaamee 15 agast tak apekshit lokapal vidheyak nirmit nahin hua to ve 16 agast se punah anshan par jaayenge
 The government announced the creation of a 10-member Lokpal draft construction committee, in accordance with the terms of the cessation of Anna Hazare's fast in April
 isamen sarkaar ke 5 evam naagarik samaaj ke 5 pratinidhi rakhe gaye
 Anna Hazare accepted a minister to be the chairman of the committee, not opposing the logic of compulsion of the constitutional provisions of the government
 kintu kapil sibbal ke netritv vaali is samiti ke mantriyon ne apni manamaani kii
 There was opposition between the civil society representatives and the government over the issue of bringing the Prime Minister and judges under the Lokpal
 kapil sibbal ne kaha ki bhavishya main kaanoon banane ke liye naagarik samaaj kii raay nahin lee jaaegi
 Finally, the ministers refused to accept all the important suggestions of the Jan Lokpal presented by Anna Hazare
 dikhaave ke liye jan lokapal ke ve sabhi bindu maan liye gaye jo sarkari mantriyon or saansadon, evam nyayadhishon ko lokapal kii pahunch se baahar rakhte the
 Finally disappointed with the attitude of government ministers, Anna Hazare's colleagues drafted the Jan Lokpal draft separately
 or is tarah samiti ne do masaude kaa nirmaan kiya jise kendriya mantrimandal ke saamne rakhaa gaya
 There too, the draft of the ministers was fully presented but the summary of the Jan Lokpal was kept
 or apeksha ke anuroop mantrimandal ne mantriyon ke masaude ko apanaakar sansad main pesh karne ke liye sahmati de di
 On 4 August 2011, the Lokpal Bill was introduced in Parliament
 sarkaar ke lokapal vidheyak main pradhanmantri ko unke kaarykaal ke dauraan iske daayre se baahar rakhaa gaya tha
 But all former Prime Ministers were placed under its purview
 iske anusaar lokapal ek samiti hogi jiske adhyaksh vartmaan yaa sevanivrutt nyaayadhish honge
 It will have eight members, of which four will be law-abiding and experienced people
 isamen jaanch kii samay seemaa saat saal rakhi gai thi
 India's 65th Independence Day celebrations were held in the shadow of Anna Hazare's announcement of the end of the April fast that if the government did not pass the Lokpal Bill by August 15, they would go on a fast
 15 agast se kai din purv hi yah spasht ho chukaa tha ki 16 agast se ghoshit anshan jarur hoga
 The government started every effort to stop it
 dilli police ne 1 agast tak jantar mantar par anshan kii anumati dene se inkaar kar diya
 After this, Anna Hazare suggested four other places and asked for permission to fast there, but that too was not given
 antat 13 agast ko anna hajaare ne ghoshnaa kii ki yadi unhen anshan kii ijaajat nahin di gai to ve jail baro andolan shuru karenge
 He also announced to abandon water
 dilli police ne jepi park main anshan karne kii anumati 22 pratibandhon ke saath di

 inamen pradarshnakariyon kii sankhya 5000 tak simit rakhane, anshan 3 din tak hi karne, anshan sthal par laudspikar kaa prayog na karne, tent na lagane aadi kii sharten shaamil thim
 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the occasion of the 65th Independence Day celebrations of India, expressed his desire to end corruption on the one hand, but at the same time termed any demonstration for him as unconstitutional
 anna hajaare sara din rajghat par chintan karte rahe or shaam ko anshan ke jari rakhane kii ghoshnaa kii
 He said, "we will go to JP Park for a fast in the morning
 We have come to know that there is Section 144 there but if we refuse to go there, then we will sit in the same place where we have to go
 prashasan unhen jahaan bhi le jaae unka anshan vahiin hoga, "ham jail main anshan par baithenge, vahaan le gaye or agar phir chhod diya to waapas jepi park par aakar baith jaayenge

 Shortly after being arrested and taken to the Civil Lines Police Mess in Delhi, he started his fast there and refused to take water

 In mathematics, hyperbolic functions are functions that resemble normal trigonometric functions, but are different functions
 hyperbolic sin "sinh", or hyperbolic kosine "cosh", moolbhoot atiparavalayik falan hai
 From these are derived the hyperbolic tangent "tanh", hyperbolic cosecant "csch" or "cosech", hyperbolic secondary "sech", and hyperbolic cotangent "coth"
 atiparavalayik falnon ko kai tarah se paribhaashit kiya jaataa he
 One method defines them as the function of exponential function - hyperbolic falnon ko avakal samikarnon ke hal ke rup main bhi paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine are unique solutions for the following system: such that s = 0 and c = 1
 These functions are also other solutions to the following equation - f ′′ = f, { \ displaystyle f '' = f,} such that f = 1, f ′ = 0, { \ displaystyle f = 1, f '= 0,} for the hyperbolic cosine, and f = 0, f ′ = 1, { \ displaystyle f = 0, f '= 1,} for the hyperbolic sine
 Hyperbolic functions may also be deduced from trigonometric functions with complex arguments: where i is the imaginary unit with the property that i 2 = - 1
 { \ displaystyle i ^ {2} = - 1
} The complex forms in the definitions above derive from Euler's formula

 Vedic, mythological, tantric and folk religion influence Hindu Hinduism
 vaidic dharm main devataaon ke moort rup kii kalpana milti he
 According to Vedic belief, Moolashakti in the form of a deity is contained in the various gifts of creation
 ek hi chetana sabhi upaadaanon main he
 This consciousness or fire, like many sphurlings, are the manifestations of the same God
 
 The Vedic deities have been classified into three categories - Prithvasthaaniya, Asthasthastaniya and Diasthaaniya
 agni, vaayu or surya kramash: in teen kotiyon kaa pratinidhitiv karte hai
 On the basis of these trinity, the first 33 and the subsequent 33 deities are envisaged
 33 devataaon ke naam or rup main granthbhed se bada antar he
 The list of 33 deities in the 'shatapatha Brahmana' is relatively different, with 8 vasu, 11 rudras, 12 adityas except the heavens and the earth are counted
 33 se adhik devataaon kii kalpana bhi ati praachin he
 The two mantras of the Rigveda mention 3339 deities
 is prakaar yadhyapi mularoop main vaidic devvaad akeshwarwad par aadhaarit he, kintu baad ko vishesh gunavachak sangyaaon dwaara inkaa is rup main vibhedikaran ho gaya ki unhone dhire dhire swatantra charitrik swaroop grahan kar liya
 His form became human or superhuman by virtue of folk faith, recognition and tradition, instead of being pure natural benevolent in character
 vedottar kaal main puranic tantric sahitya or dharm tathaa lok dharm kaa vaidic devvaad par itnaa prabhaav padaa ki vaidic devtaa parvarti kaal main apana swaroop or gun chhodkar lokmanas me sarvatha bhinn rup main hi pratishthapit hue
 In later times many Vedic deities attained the position of secondary and new deities were also imagined
 is paristhiti se bhartiya devvaad kaa swaroop or mahatv apekshaakrit adhik vyapak ho gaya
 Any worshiper in Hinduism was free to choose his deity according to his interest
 tathaapi shastron main is baat kii vyavastha bhi bataai gai ki kaary or uddeshy ke anusaar bhi devtaa kii upasana kii ja sakati he
 Thus Vishnu and Indra, the Gods of Nripe, Agni, Surya, Brahma, Shiva, the Gods of Brahmins are determined
 ek anya vyavastha ke anusaar vishnu devataaon ke, rudra brahmanon ke, chandramaa athwa som yakshon or gandharvo ke, saraswati vidyadharon ke, hari saadhy sampradaywaalon ke, parvati kinnaron ke, brahma or mahadev rishiyon ke, surya, vishnu or uma manuon ke, brahma brahmachariyon ke, ambika vaikhanson ke, shiv yatiyon ke, ganpati yaa ganesh kushmandon yaa ganon ke vishesh devtaa nirdhaarit kiye gaye hai
 But this type of discrimination is not targeted for ordinary householders
 unke liye sabhi devtaa poojaneey hai
 The Hindu deity is believed to have originated from Brahma
 tridev main brahma pratham hai
 According to Indian belief, Brahma is the best and he is the creator
 ve ek hai or unki ichha ki main bahut ho jaaon hi vishwa kii samruddhi kaa kaaran he
 In the Mandook Upanishad, Brahma has been called the first of the gods, the doer and protector of the world
 karta ke rup main vaidic sahitya main bramha kaa parichay vibhinn naamon se diya gaya he, yatha vishwakarman, brahmaswati, hiranyagarbha, prajapati, brahma or brahma
 Apart from these names in the Puranas, Dhata, Vidhata, Pitamah etc
 also came into vogue
 vaidic sahitya kii apeksha puranic sahitya main brahma kaa mahatv gaun he
 The importance of Vishnu, Shiva, even Ganapati and Surya, which is available from the point of view of worship, was not attained by Brahma, but Brahma is universally accepted as Prajapati among the Vedic deities and in this way they establish the heavens and the earth
 And live in space
 ye samast vishwa or samast praaniyon ko apni bhujaaon main aabaddh kiye rahete he
 Thus Atharva is the only form of Brahma in the Rigveda
 maanvi rup main inaki kalpana bhi badi pracheen he
 He is also accepted as the paramount deity in the Atharva and Bajasaneyi Samhita
 shatapath brahman main unhen devon ke pita tathaa isi granth main anyatra kaha gaya he ki sristi ke aadi main bhi brahma kaa astitv tha
 In Maitrayani Samhita, there is a story of Prajapati being enamored with his daughter Ushas, which is elaborated in later literature
 is katha ke prati naitik drushtikon ke kaaran parvarti samaaj main brahma kii manyata ghatati gai
 Brahma's nature also hindered his popularity
 sampradaay devtaa ke rup main ve vishnu or shiv kii tarah lokapriy na hue tathaa tapas or yajna ke vishesh himachati hone ke kaaran bhakthi ke vishesh paatr na ho sake
 At the same time, he was also compassionate on Asuras and Devas opposing Vishnu and Shiva, so both sects have ignored them
 brahma dhire dhire hindu purakatha main itnaa mahatvaheen ho jate hai ki jaisaa madhu kaitabha kii katha se pataa chalata he, ve apni hi suraksha main asamarth siddh hote hai tathaa vishnu kii krupa kii apeksha karte hai
 Both the Vaishnavite and Shaivite sects consider their deities Vishnu and Shiva to be the deities of Brahma
 is prakaar ke drushtikon kaa prabhaav bhartiya dharm par yah padaa ki us devtaa ke aadhaar par bharat main na to koi dharmik sampradaay khadaa ho sakaa or na upasya dev ke rup main brahma kii pruthak murtiyan hi prachurtaa se sthapit hui
