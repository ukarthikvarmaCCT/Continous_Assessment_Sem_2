 aapas main sambandhit bhashaaon ko bhashaa-parivaar kehete hai
 There are scientific grounds for which languages belong to which family
 is samay sansar kii bhashaaon kii teen avasthaaen hai
 The ancient languages of various countries, which have not been studied and categorized for lack of sufficient material, are in the first stage
 inkaa astitv inamen uplabdh pracheen shilalekho, sikkon or hastlikhit pustakon main abhi surakshit he
 Similar languages are Sumerian, the old language of Mesopotamia and Etruscan, the ancient language of Italy
 duusari avasthaa main aisi aadhunik bhashaayen hai, jinka samyak shodh ke abhaav main adhyayan or vibhaajan prachur saamagree ke hote hue bhi nahin ho sakaa he
 Basque, Bushman, Japanese, Korean, Andamanese etc
 languages are in this stage
 teesri avasthaa kii bhashaaon main paryaapt saamagree he or unka adhyayan evam vargeekaran ho chukaa he
 Many developed and prosperous languages like Greek, Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, English etc
 are under it
 bhashaa kaa sambandh vyakti, samaaj or desh se hota he
 Therefore each language has its own special feature
 inke aadhaar par vah ek ore kuch bhashaaon se samanta sthapit karti he or duusari ore bahut-si bhashaaon se asamanta
 Mainly there are two types of this characteristic equilibrium-morphological and semantic
 pratham ke antargat shabdon kii akruti arthath shabdon or vaakyon kii rachanastyli kii samanta dekhi jaati he
 In the second there is a similarity of meaning
 inke anusaar bhashaaon ke vargeekaran kii do paddatiyaan hoti hai–akritimulak or paariwarik yaa aitihaasik
 This discussion is related to historical classification, so its bases should be known in some detail
 isamen akritimulak samanta ke atirikt nimnilikhit samantaayein bhi honi chahie
 Geographically, there is often a similarity in proximate languages and inequality in remote languages
 is aadhaar par sansar kii bhashaayen africa, uresia, prashantmahasaagar or america ke khadon main vibhajit kii gayi hai
 However, this basis is not scientific to much extent
 kyonki do samipsth bhashaayen ek-duusare se bhinn ho sakati hai or do duurastha bhashaayen paraspar samaan
 Hindi and Malayalam are two different family languages of India but Sanskrit and English are languages of the same family in remote countries like India and England
 samaan shabdon kaa prachlan jin bhashaaon main rahata he unhen ek kul ke antargat rakhaa jaataa he
 This similarity is based on the proximity of linguists and is possible in two ways
 ek hi samaaj, jati athwa parivaar ke vyaktiyon dwaara shabdon ke samaan rup se vyavahrut hote rahane se samanta aa jaati he
 Apart from this, when people of different countries or castes come into contact with each other for political or commercial development after the development of civilization and means, equality is established between them by exchange of words
 paariwarik vargeekaran ke liye pratham prakaar kii anurupata hi kaam kii hoti he
 Because such words are the original words of the language
 inamen bhi nityprati ke kautumbik jivan main prayukt honevaale sangya, sarvnaam aadi shabd hi adhik upyogi hote hai
 The biggest difficulty in this premise is that with the development of words from other languages, the original words get mixed up in such a way that it becomes difficult to identify and separate them
 is kathinaayee kaa samaadhaan ek seemaa tak arthgat samanta he
 Because many words in the languages of a family are similar in meaning and such words relate them to a family
 isliye arthparak samanta bhi ek mahatvapurn aadhaar he
 Each language has its own theory of sound and pronunciation
 yahi kaaran he ki vah anya bhashaaon kii dhvaniyon se jaldi prabhavit nahin hoti hai or jahaan tak ho saktaa he unhen dhvaninium ke anusaar apni nearesth dhvaniyon se badal leti he
 For example, the A, B, f etc
 sounds of Persian are converted to nearby A, B, f etc
 in Hindi
 atah dhvanisamya kaa aadhaar shabdaawalee-samta se adhik vishwasaneey he
 By the way, sometimes the sounds of one language also develop together in the sounds group of one language and confuse the comparative conclusions
 arya bhashaaon main vaidic kaal se pehle murdhanya dhvaniyaan nahin thi, kintu dravid bhashaa ke prabhaav se aage chalakar viksit ho gayin
 The grammatical basis is most authentic
 kyonki bhashaa kaa anushaasan karne ke kaaran yah jaldi badalata nahin he
 Under the similarity of grammar, word-formation by applying suffix to metal, metal, grammatical process, it is necessary to determine the similarity of terms and structure of terms, etc
 in words
 in chaar aadhaaron par bhashaaon kii adhikadhik samanta nishchit karte unka vargeekaran kiya jaataa he
 In this regard, it should be clearly understood that this equilibrium is relative
 jahaan ek ore bhaaropee parivaar kii bhashaayen anya parivaar kii bhashaaon se bhinn or aapas main samaan hai vahaan duusari ore sanskrit, farsi, greek aadi bhaaropee bhashaayen ek-duusare se inhen aadhaaron par bhinn bhi hai
 At the time of classification, entire languages are divided into Eurasia, Pacific, Sea, Africa and America segments or cycles based on geographical proximity
 phir aapasi samanta rakhanevaali bhashaaon ko ek kul yaa parivaar main rakhkar vibhinn parivaar banaaye jate hai
 a comparison of Avesta, Persian, Sanskrit, Greek etc
 showed that there is a lot of similarity in their vocabulary, sound group and composition
 atah bharat or europe ke is tarah kii bhashaaon kaa ek bhartiya kul bana diya gaya he
 Families are divided into classes
 bhaaropee parivaar main shatam or kentum aise hi varg hai
 Classes are divided into branches
 shatam varg kii ‘irani’ or ‘bhartiya arya’ pramukh shakhaayen hai
 Branches have been divided into sub branches
 grearsan ne aadhunik bhartiya arya bhashaaon ko bhitari or bahari upashakha main vibhakt kiya he
 Hence, subdivisions are divided into language communities and community languages
 is tarah bhashaa paariwarik-vargeekaran kii ikai he
 At this time, the study of the languages of the European family has been done so much that the whole process is applied to it
 in naamon main thodi her-pher ho saktaa he, kintu is prakriya kii avasthaaon main praayah koi antar nahin hota
 It was only in the nineteenth century that the attention of scholars drew attention to the classification of the languages of the world, and to date, many scholars have presented their different classifications from time to time; However, no scientific and authentic classification has yet been presented
 is samasya ko lekar bhashavidon main bada matbhed he
 This is the reason that on the one hand, where the Friedrich Müllers consider the number of these families to be 100, on the other hand, Rice keeps all the languages of the world in only one family
 kintu adhikansh vidvan inaki sankhya baarah yaa teraa maanate hai
 Around seven thousand languages spoken around the world are divided into at least ten families, of which the main families are mentioned below: mukhya lekh hind-europea bhashaa-parivaar This group is the largest family of languages and also the most important because English, Russian, Ancient Persian, Hindi, Punjabi, German - all these languages belong to this group
 ise 'bhaaropee bhashaa-parivaar' bhi kehete hai
 About half of the world's population speaks indo-european language
 sanskrit, greek or laathini jaisi shastreey bhashaaon kaa sambandh bhi isi samooh se he
 But Arabic belongs to a completely different family
 is parivaar kii pracheen bhashaayen bahirmukhi shlisht-yogtmak thim
 This group was also called arya-parivar earlier
 vishwa main jansankhya ke anusaar sabase badi bhashaa mandarin isi parivaar se sambandh rakhti he
 Apart from many languages spoken in China and Tibet, Burmese language also belongs to this family
 inaki swaralahari ek hi he
 If the same word is spoken in high or low vowel, the meaning of the word changes
 shri rajendra singh ne bharat ke sandarbh main is bhashaa parivaar ko 'naag bhashaa parivaar' naam diya he
 It is also called 'monosyllabic family'
 kaaran ki iske mul shabd praaia: ekakshar hote hai
 These languages are spoken in Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Nepal, Sikkim, West Bengal, Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Manipur, Tripura and Mizoram
 isaki pramukh bhashaaon main arami, aseri, sumeri, akkadi or kanani vagairah shaamil thim lekin aajkal is samooh kii prasiddhtam bhashaayen arabi or ibrani hai
 These languages mainly consist of three metal-letters and by making vowels in between, they form verbs and nouns
 bhashaaon kaa dravidi parivaar is lihaaz se bada dilachasp he ki haalaanki ye bhashaayen bharat ke dakshini pradeshon main boli jaati hai lekin unka uttari kshetra main boli jane vaali bhashaaon se koi sambandh nahin he 
 Therefore, Urdu or Hindi can be related to English or German language, but not to Malayalam language
 dakshini bharat or srilanka main dravidi samooh kii koi 26 bhashaayen boli jaati hai lekin unamem zyaada mashhoor tamil, telegu, malayalam or kannada hai
 These are inter-vulgar-yogic languages
 pramukh bhashaaon ke aadhaar par iske anya naam – ‘toorani’, ‘sidian’, ‘phoni-tatarik’ or ‘turk-mongol-manchu’ kul bhi hai
 Its area is very wide, but mainly in Siberia, Manchuria and Mongolia
 pramukh bhashaayen–turki yaa tathari, kirgiz, mongoli or manchu he, jiname sarv pramukh turki he
 The literary language is Osmanali
 turki par arabi or farsi kaa bahut adhik prabhaav tha kintu aajkal iskaa shabdasmooh bahut kuch apana he
 The Ural and Altai languages of this family are quite different from each other in terms of sound and vocabulary
 isliye kuch vidvan inhen do pruthak kulon main rakhane ke paksh main bhi hai, kintu vyakaranik samya par nissandeh ve ek hi kul kii bhashaayen thaharti hai
 The rule of word formation with the addition of suffixes, immutability of metals, the form and form of the suffixes are the main features of the languages of a family
 swaranurupata se abhipraay yah he ki mak pratyay yajdhatu main lagane par yajmak kintu saadharantaya vishaal aakaar or adhik shakti kii vastuon ke bodhak shabd pulling tathaa durbal env laghu aakaar kii vastuon ke suchak shabd streeling hote hai
 i will be in accordance with Yaj, but after applying in Sevak, Sevmake will be made as per Sev

 sangeet kii dhunon ko banane yaa sanvaarane vaale kalakaar ko sangeetkaar kehete he
 Shishugraha is those solid objects that are being formed in the Adigraha Chakra or debris cycle around a star
 haalanki khagolashastriyon ne ajtak kisi shishugrah ko vastav main dekha nahin he lekin grah-nirmaan kii prakriya ke bare main yah vichaar he ki armbh main kisi taare ke ird-gird parikrama karata hua khagoleey dhul kaa chakra hota he
 Then the particles of this cycle collide with each other and sometimes cling to each other due to the effect of gravity
 dhire-dhire vastuen banane lagati hai 
 When some objects become larger, their gravity also increases and they begin to increase size by pulling particles towards them more quickly
 is str par unhen shishugrah kaha jaataa he kyonki iske baad inamen jald hi anya vastuon or malbe ko khinchakar grah kaa aakaar bana lene kii gurutvkarshak kshamta aa jaati he
 Over a period of time, their size becomes like our moon and due to the shrinkage of fierce gravity, its form also starts to be circular
 phir yah apane taare kii parikrama karte hue apane kaksha main sthit sabhi vastuon ko apane main villin kar leti he or apana maarg saafe kar leti he
 According to the rules of the International Astronomical Union, the process of clearing the objects and debris located in the orbit orbit is the definition of attaining planet status
 dhyaan den ki yah aavashyak nahin he ki sabhi shishugrah badhkar grah ban saken
 Often, due to your collision, it breaks and becomes smaller
 hamaare saura mandal ke kshudragrah 4 vesta ke saath kuch aisa hi hua lagata he
 In the southern hemisphere of Vesta there is a 505 km deep strike crater called Rialsilvia and a billionth year ago a large object had a fierce collision with Vesta that uprooted a large fraction of Vesta and took the shape of the planet Stopped from
 marudhar mhaaro ghar rajasthani film ab tak kii sarvaadhik bajet vaali rajasthani film he

 This joyous dance is performed by both young men and women and is characterized by agile dance postures and rapid movements of the hands
 nartak paaramparik rangeen asamiya paridhaan pahante hai
 Although the origins of the Bihu dance are unknown, the first official evidence of this is found when Ahom king Rudra Singh invited Bihu dancers to perform it in the Ranaghar regions on the occasion of Rongali Bihu circa 1694
 bihu ek samooh nrity he jisamen purush or mahilaayein saath-saath nrity karte hai kintu alag-alag ling bhoomikaayen banaae rakhte hai
 Usually women strictly follow the row or circle structure
 purush nartak or sangeetkaar nrity kshetra main sabase pehle pravesh karte hai or ve apni pankti ko banaae rakhte hai or samakramik akritiyaan banaate hai
 When the female dancers later enter, the male dancers break their lines to meet with the female dancers, who maintain their structures and dance order

 aam taur par shuruyaat main dardanaak mul bhav dene ke liye ekal kalakaar dwaara mohor xingore pepa bajaayaa jaataa he tathaa isse nrity ke liye maahaul taiyaar hota he
 The male dancers then enter the dance arena by performing a composition and performing with singing, in which everyone participates

 Bamboo flutes are also often used
 nrity ke saath gaaye jane vaale geet kai pidiyon se hastantarit hote aa rahe hai
 The themes of the songs range from the welcome of the Assamese New Year to descriptions of the daily life of a farmer, from historical references to the invasion of Assam to satirical topical social and political commentary

 Discussions have been made about their relationship
 shaivagam hi virshaiv dharm ke sarvocch granth hai or agar anya shaiva sahitya or puraano main koi vivaad hota he to shaivagmahi maanya hogi

 Prithviraj Raso is an epic written in Hindi language describing the life and character of Prithviraj Chauhan
 iske rachayita raav chand bardaai bhatta jo chandisa raav ke kaladi gautra se the va prithviraj ke bachapan ke mitra or unke raajakavi the or unki yuddh yatraaon ke samay vir ras kii kavitaaon se sena ko protsaahit bhi karte the
 Between 1165 and 1192 when Prithviraj Chauhan's kingdom extended from Ajmer to Delhi
 prithvirajraso dhai hajaar prishthon kaa bahut bada granth he jisamen 69 samay hai
 Almost all the verses practiced in ancient times have been treated in it
 mukhya chand hai - kavitt, duha, tomars, trotak, gaha or aryaa
 Just as it is famous with respect to Kadambari that the previous part of it has been completed by the son of Baan Bhatt, similarly the previous part of Raso has also been completed by Chand's son Jalahan
 raso ke anusaar jab shahabuddin gori prithviraj ko kaid karke gazani le gaya, tab kuch dinon peeche chand bhi vahiin gaye
 While leaving, the poet gave the book of Raso in the hands of his son Jalahan and indicated to complete it
 jalhan ke haath main raso ko saunpe jane or uske puure kiye jane kaa ullekh raso main he - Many scholars doubt Prithvirajasso's contemporary poetry as being written in the 16th century, due to the disproportion of the texts given in Raso with historical facts in many places
 is rachana kii sabase puraani prati bikaner ke rajkeey pustkaalay me mili he kul 3 pratiyaan he
 At the end of the composition Prithviraj has also talked about killing Gauri by running a piercing arrow
 prithvirajraso raasak parampara kaa ek kavy he
 As its name suggests, a Hindi treatise written about the events of the life of Prithviraj, the last Hindu emperor of Delhi, is believed to be written by Rao Chandravadai Bhatt
 pehle is kavy ke ek hi rup se hindi jagat parichit tha, jo sanyog se rachana kaa sabase adhik vishaal rup tha isamen lagbhag gyaarah hajaar roopak aate the
 After that a smaller version of the composition was found in some copies, which had about three and a half thousand metaphors
 uske bhi baad ek rup kuch pratiyon main praapt hua jisamen kul rupaksankhya baarah sau se adhik nahin thi
 Subsequently, two copies were also received which had only four hundred and five and a half hundred metaphors respectively
 ye sabhi pratiyaan rachana ke vibhinn purna rup prastut karti thim
 Copies of some volumes of the composition have also been received, which are related to the first two forms mentioned above
 at: swabhaavat: yah vivaad uthaa ki uparyukt vibhinn purna roopon kaa vikaas kis prakaar hua
 Some scholars differed completely from this
 unhone kaha ki sabase bada rup hi rachana kaa mul rup rahaa hoga or usee se uttarottar adhikadhik chote rup sankshepon ke rup main banaakar prastut kiye gaye honge
 He gave the proof that no form of creation, even the smallest form, is free from antiquity
 kintu is vivaad ko phir yaheen par chhod diya gaya or isko hal karne kaa koi prayaas bahut dinon tak nahin kiya gaya
 Its first notable attempt was in 1955
 jab ek vidwaan ne prithviraj raso ke teen paathon kaa aakaar sambandh sheershak lekh likar yah dikhaaya ki prithviraj or uske vipaksh ke balaabal ko suchit karanevaali jo sankhyaayein rachana ke teen vibhinn paathon : sabase bade, usase chote or usase bhi chote main milti hai unamem samanta nahin he or yadi samgr rup se dekha jaay to in sankhyaon ke sambandh main atyukti kii maatra bhi uparyukt kram main hi uttarottar kam milti he
 If these texts had developed in the order of the greater medium, there would have been no difference in the numerical numbers due to the abbreviated verb
 isaliye yah prakat he ki praapt roopon ke vikaas kaa kram laghutmalaghumadhyambrihat he
 From the point of view of management, if we pay attention to the rhyme series and rhyme chains and context series, we will also see that these series are progressively broken in the shortest order of the shortest order and are kept in between by more and more verses and context trajectories
 kintu rachana kaa praapt sabase chota rup bhi in shrinkhalatrutiyon se sarvatha mukt nahin he, isaliye spasht gyaat hota he ki 'raso' kaa mul rup praapt laghutam rup se bhi chota rahaa hoga
 The story of 'prithvirajasso' is summarized as follows: At the time when Prithviraj was on the throne of Delhi, King Jayachand of Kannauj decided to perform a Rajasuya Yajna and on this occasion he also resolved to perform the swayamvara of his daughter Samyukrita
 rajasuya kaa nimantran usne dur dur tak ke raajaaon ko bheja or prithviraj ko bhi usamen sammilit hone ke liye aamantrit kiya
 Prithviraj and his feudatories were persuaded that, despite the verses, some other Rajasuya would perform a yagna and Prithviraj declined Jayachand's invitation
 jayachand ne phir bhi rajasuya yajna karnaa thaanakar yagyamandap ke dwaar par dwarpal ke rup main prithviraj kii ek pratimaa sthapit kar di
 Prithviraj was naturally angry at this incident as an insult
 isi bich use yah bhi samachar mila ki jayachand kii kanya sanyogita ne pita ke vachanon kii upeksha kar prithviraj ko hi pati rup main varan karne kaa sankalp kiya he or jayachand ne isapar cruddh hokar use alag gangatatavarti ek awaas main bhijwa diya he
 Satisfied with these news, he was somehow spending his time outside the capital in the game that his minister Kavas, taking advantage of his absence, had an inappropriate relationship with one of his Karnati maids and one day entered his chamber at night
 pattarai ko jab yah baat gyaat hui, usne prithviraj ko tatkaal bulavaa bheja or prithviraj raat ko hi do ghadiyon main rajbhavan main aa gaya
 When he was shown to Kavas in the said maid's chamber, he aimed them in the dark of night and released the arrows
 pehla baan to chook gaya kintu duusare baan ke lagate hi kainvas dharashayi ho gaya
 At night, Prithviraj went to the game after getting both of them buried in a pit, then returned to the capital the next day
 kainvas kii stri ne chand se apane mrit pati kaa shav dilaane kii prarthana kii to chand ne prithviraj se yah nivedan kiya
 Prithviraj accepted Chand's request on the condition that he would take Kannauj with him
 donon mitra kasakar gale milte ore roe
 Prithviraj said that it was good to die from this humiliating life and his poet approved this sentiment
 kainvas kaa shav lekar uski vidhwaa sati ho gai
 Prithviraj traveled to Kannauj in the remainder of Thawaitt with Chand
 saath main sau vir rajput saamanton sainikon ko bhi usne le liya
 After reaching Kannauj, he went to the court of Jaichand
 jayachand ne uskaa bahut satkar kiya or usase prithviraj ke vay, rup aadi ke sambandh main poocha
 Chand gave some description of him, Jaichand was shocked by seeing his follower Thawaitt
 shankaanivaranarth usne kavi ko paan arpit karaane ke bahaane anya daasiyon ke saath ek daasi ko bulaayaa jo pehle prithviraj kii seva main rah chuki thi
 He covered Prithviraj on seeing Thwaitt in disguise
 kintu kisi ne kaha ki chand prithviraj kaa abhinn sakha tha isaliye daasi ne use dekh sir dhank liya or baat vahiin par samaapt ho gai
 But on the next morning, when Jaichand went to meet Chand at his camp, Thawitt was seated on the throne and was again suspicious
 chand ne bahaane karke uski shankaa kaa nivaaran karnaa chaha or thawitt se use paan arpit karne kaa kaha
 The whirlwind Vrithi Prithviraj threw while drinking, convinced Jaichand that he was Prithviraj himself and took orders to confront Prithviraj
 idhar prithviraj nagar kii parikrama ke liye niklaa
 As he was sucking pearls to the fishes in the Ganges, Sanyogita sent a maid to identify her properly and make her love when she was Prithviraj
 daasi ne jab yah nishchay kar liya ki vah prithviraj hi he, usne sanyogita kaa pranaynivedan kiya
 Prithviraj met Sankrita later and both of them entered the Gangesathar residence
 us samay vah vahaan se chalaa aayaa kintu apane saamanton ke kehane par vah pun: jaanakar sanyogita kaa saath liva laayaa
 When he kidnapped this type of Sanyogita, Chand defiantly told Jaichand that his enemy Prithviraj was now asking for war in the form of mercy by announcing his daughter
 parinamat: donon pakshon main sangharsh prarambh ho gaya
 In a two-day war when many of Prithviraj's warriors were killed, the feudals advised him to change the mode of war
 unhone sujhaayaa ki vah sanyogita ko lekar dilli kii ore bade or ve jayachand kii sena ko dilli ke maarg main aage badhane se rokte rahen jab tak vah sanyogita ko lekar dilli na pahunch jaae
 Prithviraj accepted this and the sacrifice of many feudal and heroic warriors went to Delhi with endless coincidence
 jayachand apni sena ke saath kannauj laut gaya
 Arriving in Delhi, Prithviraj, along with Sanyogita, became delirious
 chah maheene tak awaas se baahar niklaa hi nahin, jiske parinamswaroop uske guru, bandhav, bhaty tathaa lok main uske prati asantosh utpann ho gaya
 When the subjects requested the Rajguru to suffer, Rajguru went to Sanyogita's residence with Chand
 donon ne milakar prithviraj ko gori ke akraman kii soochika patrika bheji or sandeshvahika daasi se kahala bheja : 'gori rattatuadhara tu gori anuratt
 'the king's luxury sleep was disturbed and he left for battle by chance
 shahabuddin is baar badi baari sena lekar aayaa hua tha
 Many of Prithviraj's brave warriors and feudal Kannos were killed in the war itself
 parinamat: prithviraj kii sena rankshetra se laut padi or shahbuddin vijayi hua
 Prithviraj was imprisoned and taken to Ghazni
 vahaan par kuch dinon baad shahabuddin ne uski ankhen nikalava leen
 When news of the sufferings of Chand Prithviraj came, that Ghajini went under the control of Avadhoot for the salvation of his friend and master
 vah shahabuddin se mila
 On asking the reason for going there, he told that now he wanted to go to Badarikashram and do penance, but one sadness was remaining in his life, so he had not yet gone there
 usne prithviraj ke saath janm grahan kiya tha or ve bachapan main saath saath hi khele koode the
 At the same time, Prithviraj told him that he could pierce seven gongs at once with the help of Singini without any fruit
 uskaa yah kaushal vah nahin dekh sakaa tha or ab dekhakar apni vah saadh puri karnaa chahta tha
 Ghori said that he has been blinded
 chand ne kaha ki vah phir bhi vaisaa sandhanakaushal dikhaa saktaa he, use yah vishwaas tha
 Shahabuddin accepted this demand and got all the arrangements made
 chand ke protsaahit karne par jivan se niraash prithviraj ne bhi apana sanghan kaushal dikhaane ke bahaane shatru ke vadh karne kaa uskaa aagrah sweekaar kar liya
 With approval from Prithviraj, Chand went to Shahabuddin and said that he was ready to do the goal only if he himself called for Lakshwadeh with his mouth three times
 shahabuddin ne ise bhi sweekaar kar liya1 shah ne do farmaan die, phir teesraa usne jyon hi diya prithviraj ke baan se viddh hokar vah dharashayi hua
 Prithviraj also came to an end
 devataaon ne us par pushpavrishti kii or prithvi ne mlechha gori se traan paakar harsh prakat kiya
 Here the story of 'prithvirajasso' ends
 'raso' kii aitihaasikta ko lekar, vishesh rup se jab se prasiddh vidvan or puraatatvajna vular ko 'prithviraj vijay' naamak sanskrit kavy kii khandit prati mili, bada vivaad chalaa he
 This dispute has been raised about its larger text, but it is not even the shortest text of the composition that is completely free from antiquity
 udaahranarth jayachand ke dwaara daahal ke karn ko do baar parajeet or bandi kiye jane kaa ullekh miltaa he, kintu vah jayachand se lagbhag sava sau varsh purv hua tha
 No definite historical support has yet been received in connection with the battle of Prithviraj said to Jaichand
 prithviraj ajmer kaa shaasha tha; dilli kaa shaasha koi govindaray yaa khanderay tha jo prithviraj kii ore se donon yudhon se ladaa tha ore duusare yuddh main maaraa gaya tha
 According to Muslim historians, Prithviraj had only two wars with Ghori, according to 'raso' there were at least four sons, out of which three Shahabuddin were defeated and imprisoned
 musalmaan itihaaskaaron ke anusaar prithviraj parajeet hone ke ananthar saraswati ke nikat pakadaa gaya or maaraa gaya tha, jabaki 'raso' ke anusaar vah shhabuddin ko gazani main uparyukt prakaar se markar mara tha
 These historical references and descriptions are found in all the forms of 'prithvirajasso' and most of them belong to its weft, so will be found in any of its reconstructed forms
 isaliye yah maananaa hi padegaa ki uskaa koi bhi rup prithviraj kii samakaleen rachana nahin ho saktaa he
 The question is that what time can 'raso' be considered a creation
 kuch samay hua, prasiddh anveshi vidvan muni jinvijay ko jain bhandaron main do 'jain prabandh' sangrahon kii ek ek prati mili, jinamein 'prithviraj prabandh' or 'jayachand prabandh' sakalit the
 Some of the verses quoted in these arrangements were also found in 'prithviraj Raso', although the language of these quotes was more secure in antiquity than the language of 'raso'
 donon pratiyon main 'prithviraj prabandh' praaia: abhinn tha or ek prabandhsangrah kii prati san
 1528 kii thi
 From this, Muniji deduced that Chand was definitely a contemporary of Prithviraj and his royalty
 kintu itane se hi yah parinaam nikaalan tarksammat na hoga
 On the basis of these facts, we can only say that Chand received some form of composition before the year 1528, from which those verses are quoted in the above 'prithvirajaprabandh'
 vah rup san
 1528 ke kitne purv nirmit hua hoga iske sambandh main kuch anumaan se hi kaha ja saktaa he, jiske liye nimnlikhit aadhaar liye ja sakate hai : One of the verses quoted is not found in copies of the short text of 'raso' in which Canvas is called 'vyas' and Vasishtha, while all the forms of 'raso' give an account of his undue love with the Carnatic maid, It is evident from the fact that the original author, the author of the above verses, was proclaimed; The original form of the composition should also precede it
 yadi maan liya jaay ki rachana kaa ukt prakshipt rup uske mul rup ke lagbhag 50 varsh baad kaa hoga, aadharbhoot purvaj sangrah uske bhi lagbhag 25 varsh baad taiyaar kiye gaye honge or praapt pratiyaan ukt donon prabandhsangrahon ke taiyaar hone ke bhi lagbhag pachis varsh baad kii hongi, to mul kavyrachana san
 1400 ke lagbhag kii maani ja sakati he
 There is no leniency in this estimate of time, so the date of the original composition cannot be postponed much later
 rachana kii bhashaa kaa jo rup prabandhsangrahon ke udaahranon main tathaa rachana ke laghutam roopon kii pratiyon main miltaa he, vah bhi san
 1400 ke aas paas kaa gyaat hota he, isaliye bhashaa kaa sakshya bhi uparyukt parinaam kii pushti karata he
 'prithvirajasso' is the best Hindi poetry of Veer Ras
 hindi sahitya main vir charitron kii jaisi vishad kalpana is kavy main mili waisi baad main kabhi nahin dikhaai padi
 The reader flows throughout the composition in an overflowing stream of excitement
 kannauj yuddh ke purv sanyogita ke anuraag or virah tathaa ukt yuddh ke ananthar prithviraj sanyogita ke milan or keli vilaas ke jo chitra rachana main milte hai, ve atyant aakarshak hai
 Other juices are also not lacking in poetry
 rachana kaa varnanavaibhav asaadhaaran he; nayak nayika ke sambhog samay kaa shadritu varnan kahin kahin par sanshlisht prakrutichitran ke sundar udhaaharan prastut karata he
 The language style is effective everywhere and varies throughout the poetry according to the subject
 rachana ke in samast gunon par drushtipaat kiya jaae to vah ek sundar mahakavy pramanit hota he or ni:andeh aadhunik bhartiya aryabhasha sahitya ke aadi yug kii vishisht kriti thaharti he
