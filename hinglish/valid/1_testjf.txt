 As a result, the method of supplementary estimation was adopted for accurate estimation of the income of these countries

 This force, dedicated to fighting insurgency in Kashmir and perfecting the weak local security forces in the region, was raised in 1990 by General SF Rodrigues and minted by General BC Joshi

 Some observers expected it to grow to thirty battalions and have about 25,000 personnel

 It was reported that the force was carrying out operations against militants in south-central Jammu and Kashmir and foreign militants in Doda district

 Even if the battalion performed well under adverse conditions, it was mainly due to the leadership of the officers and their professional ability
 ise dhyaan main rakhte hue, aaraar batalian kii buniyadi sanrachana ko badalane ke liye nirnay liya gaya tha
 In place of their units which were composed of soldiers from all over the army, two RR battalions were formed infantry regiments, which formed an integral part of each other, the main contingent of one regiment and all the other regiments
 ab na keval do aaraar regiment, lekin unke commanding adhikari yaa 2IC bhi usee regiment se hota tha
 This experiment produced excellent results, even when the units were deployed in the most inaccessible areas
 rashtriya rifles main 65 batalian shaamil hai

 The Railway Indicator System is used to inform the drivers of the train ahead of the track
 signal pranali hi aaj gadiyon ke surakshit tathaa teevr gati sanchaalan kii kunjee he
 The railway signal is usually called the fixed trackers on the track so that the train driver can know the condition of the next section of the track
 prarambh main aise siganlon kii vyavastha nahin thi tathaa darllington se stakatan jane vaali pehali railgadee ke aage kuch ghudsavaar santri rasta saaf karne ke liye chale the
 After that, this work was done by standing the sentries at certain distances
 samay kii pragati ke saath in santriyon ke sthaan par sthavar singhnal lagaae jane lage
 The first signal of the world was made by placing a candle on the table of the station master of Hatlpool station in England
 iske baad hi tashtaree jaise gol signal chaalu hue
 In 1832, when the transport of vehicles by steam locomotives was introduced, a 17-mile dulari-to-dome signal system between Newcastle and French Town was used
 is pranali main teen-teen mile par lagbhag 30 foot unche khambhe lagaae gaye
 As soon as a car was driven from one side, a white ball with the flag would climb the full height of the pole
 agle khambhe ke paas kaa jhandiwala is gend ko apni doorabeen dwaara dekhakar isi prakaar kii ek safed gend apane khambhe par chotii se kuch neeche tak chadha detaa

 is prakaar kuch hi minuton main duusari ore se stesan ko gaadi ke chalane kaa pataa chal jaataa or ve satark ho jate
 If the car could not run on its own time, the black ball would be replaced in place of the white ball
 is prakaar taar dwaara soochna dene kaa avishkaar hone se pehle yah pranali gaadi chalaane main badi sahaayak siddh hui
 But at that time there was no interpolation of the signal into the hook and cross and the signal could be in the 'favorable' state even though the fork was in the unfavorable condition of the passage
 is kaaran puri suraksha nahin hoti thi tathaa kisi bhi maanviya truti ke kaaran durghatana kii sambhaavna ho jaati thi
 To overcome this, the indicator and fork cross-section were interpolated so that if the thorn was crossing, the indicator could not be 'adapted'
 aarambh main yah antahpashan yantric hota tha
 But with the advancement of science and the invention of relay, there is now electrical interference
 yantric antahpashan kaa prayog england main sarvapratham bricalyar-arm jankshan par san 1843 main hua tha
 Its use in America began in 1874 and in India in 1912
 san 1871 main trek sarkit kaa avishkaar ho jane se swachaalit signal pranali kaa prayog bhi sambhav ho gaya
 With the help of this, the indicators automatically reach a state of 'vigilance' or 'crisis' according to the condition of the next section by electrifying the vehicles with and without external help
 trek sarkit tathaa riley kii sahaayta se yatayaat niyantran ke liye sanketak vyavastha kii pragati aashaatheet hui he
 Traffic can now be easily operated from a remote central location
 aise sanchaalan ko kendrikrut yatayaat niyantran kehete hai
 At the time when rail transport started in India, hand-light indicators of rotating goggles or different colored mirrors were used
 tashtareenuma gol sanketak yadi line se samakon banaata to aage 'sankat' kaa suchak hota ki aage rasta 'anukool' he or gaadi ja sakati he
 Thereafter, indicators for both directions were placed on the same pillar at the stations
 inamen har disha ke liye ek alag-alag upar neeche girane vaala bhujaa sanketak hota tha or stesan master jis ore kii gaadi ko aane kii ajna dena chahta tha usee ore ke sanketak ko gira detaa tha
 Such indicators have been practiced in some parts even till 25 years ago
 san 1892 tak bharat main koi vyavasthit signal pranali nahin thi
 This year on the north-western Railway, Shri G
H
 Liston did an important job of arranging the interlocking of signals and forks by placing a special device at the crossing stations
 is yantra kii sahaayta se is baat kaa aashwaasan ho jaataa tha ki yadi sanketak 'anukool' he to kaante crossing avashya hi anukool honge or isiilie gaadi kii gati dhimi karne kii aavashyaktaa nahin he jo bina is pranali ke atyaavashyak thi
 In 1894, Mr
 A
 In collaboration with Morse, he introduced the List and Morse system by making necessary modifications to his instrument
 is pranali ke kaaran hi list or morse ko bharat kii signal pranali kaa 'janak' kaha jaataa he
 By 1904, the key to the interception of the signal and fork crossing was sent to the station master by the carrier, seeing that it 'suited' the indicator, but it wasted time in transporting and fetching the key and in traffic speed Had to be interrupted

 cabin antahpashan kaa avishkaar jaan sexbi ne kiya tha or aarambh main iskaa prayog british relon main hua tha
 In the early twentieth century it also started its practice on Indian Railways
 isaki kuch yojanaayen to messors sexbi or farmar form ne san 1893 main hi taiyaar kar lee thim par isaki gadiyon kii chaal tathaa yatayaat badhane par, use surakshitsh rakhane ke liye antahpashan kii aavashyaktaa prathit hone par hi apanaaya gaya
 First of all G

 Cabin interpolation was used extensively on the railway route to Bombay and Delhi
 yah avasthaa san 1912 main puri hokar chaalu kii gai
 Similarly, later on the main routes of other trains were also started
 yantric sanket pranali main dohare taar ke sanketakon kaa pramukh sthaan ho gaya he
 In this, two wires are used for operation of forks, looping detectors and indicators from the cabin
 yah pranali ab bhartiya relon par vistrut rup se prachlit ho gai he tathaa duusari yantric sanket pranaaliyon se adhik uttam maani jaati he
 One of the biggest advantages of the double-wire indicator system is that it can achieve a much longer measured speed and thereby control the indicators without much difficulty over a long distance
 chhadon dwaara 500 gaj kii jagah is pranali dwaara kaante croscingon kaa 800 gaj tak dakshata se sanchaalan kiya ja saktaa he tathaa sanketak to 1500 gaj kii duuri tak kaary kar saktaa he
 In this system there is also no need to adopt an unreliable method of counterbalance to bring the indicators back to the 'crisis' state and the liver has to be actively pulled to bring the indicators back to the pre-condition
 is kaaran dohare taar kii sanketak pranali main anadhikrut sanchaalan asambhav ho jaataa he
 Also, the temperature change in the speed of the indicators using automatic compensators also has no effect
 is pranali kaa upyog aarthik drushti se bhi laabhadaayak he kyonki isamen aasaani se 1000 gaj lambii yaa isse adhik tak kii loop line ke steshnon kaa kendriya cabin se hi sanchaalan kiya ja saktaa he jiske kaaran ek cabin tathaa uske sanchaalan ke vyay kii bachat ho jaati he
 Liver structure For a double wire system, the liver structure is made by connecting two 10-inch-3-inch channels with the liver in the middle
 ye channlein cabin kii shateeron main bolt dwaara judi rahati he
 The liver is the shape of a drum with a handle of appropriate measure by which the drum can be rotated up to 180 degrees and thus the position of the indicator can be changed by rotating the desired specified amount
 har liver alag-alag judaa hone ke kaaran unamem se kisi ko bhi aasaani se badla ja saktaa he
 The signal driver is the instrument used to operate the indicator
 iske dwaara sanketak ko 0 ansh, 45 ansh, yaa 90 ansh kone par kisi bhi dasha main laayaa ja saktaa he
 They are designed in such a way that the indicator is not likely to remain in any other angle or position and in the event of a wire breakdown, the indicator immediately reaches the 'crisis' indicator state
 kaanta chaalak yantra -kaante kii chaal ke liye ek daantdaar chad yantrachakra ke saath fasaa rahata he
 This rod moves the hook and also drives the looping rod, due to which the fork gets looped as it reaches its place
 saath hi aisa prabandh bhi hota he ki taar ke tut jane par kaanta apane sthaan par hi sthit rahata he or usamen koi gati nahin kii ja sakati
 Conductor - Another very useful instrument used in the dual wire signal system is the 'introducer'
 iskaa kaary parpath ke kaante ke thik jagah par pahunchne kii jaanch karnaa he
 This investigation has an important place in transportation safety
 is jaanch ke saath hi parichaayak taar tut jane par kaante ko apane sthaan par jakad bhi detaa he
 The identifying fork has a circle attached to it which is connected with the signal system wires and rotates with their movement
 is pahie ke bahari hisse main khaanche kate hue hote hai jo kaanton kii chaal ke saath chalane vaali lohe kii rokon main atak jate hai
 Thus, if the fork is in the 'unfavorable' condition, it becomes impossible for the indicator to be in the 'favorable' direction
 swachaalit signal pranali -beesvin shatabdi ke aarambh main rail line ko bijli dwaara signal se sambandhit karne kii pratha trek sarkiting, nikali or kramshah bharat ke bade-bade steshnon par chaalu kii gayi
 By electrifying the track, it is known by electricity that there are no obstacles of any kind or any other road ahead
 trek sarkiting ke dwaara swachaalit signal pranali bhi sambhav ho saki he
 This makes it possible to run trains one behind the other on dual lines at a difference of few minutes
 jaise hi gaadi kisi khand main padaarpan karti he, us khand ke prarambh vaala sanketak 'sankat' dasha kaa pradarshan karne lagata he tathaa usase pehle khand ke prarambh kaa sanketak 'satarkta' soochna detaa he
 As soon as the train exits the section, the indicator automatically returns to the 'favorable' condition
 is prakaar gaadi ke chaalak ko pataa rahata he ki agle khandon main koi gaadi yaa rukaawat to nahin he
 If this happens, he acts cautiously and stops the car
 yatayaat ke liye prayog kiye jane vaale sanketak mukhyatah paanch prakaar ke hote hai: Border arm indicator rangeen prakaash sanketak Light status indicator rangeen prakaash sanketak Driver cell indicator khambhe par bhujaa kii dasha se vibhinn sanket dene vaale sanketak ko simafor sanketak kehete hai
 The movement of the arm can be either the lower circle foot down or the upper circle foot down
 neeche kii ore chaal vaale sanketak do hi dashaon ke dyotak hote hai
 The transverse position of the arm is the 'crisis' indicator and the position making an angle of 45 degrees is the 'safety' indicator
 iske vipareet upree chaal vaale sanketak teen dashaon ke dyotak hote hai
 In these, the transverse position of the arm is also an indicator
 duusari dasha main bhujaa upar kii ore 45 ansh kaa kone banaati he
 It is a 'vigilance' indicator
 teesri dasha main bhujaa ekadam upar ko sidhi ho jaati he or 'anukool' hoti he jisase yah pataa chalata he ki rasta ekadam saaf he tathaa chaalak puure veg se ja saktaa he
 Having three positions reported in the upper speed gives the driver enough time to stop before a 'crisis' and so if the arm of the indicator is in safety, it can move at full speed without hesitation
 bhujaa sanketak raatri ke samay kaary main nahin laae ja sakate
 This is indicated by colored lights at their place at night
 'sankat' kii soochna ke liye laal roshni kaa sanket hota he
 We use yellow for 'vigilance' and green light for 'favorable path'
 vidyut tathaa lenson kii sahaayta se sanketak kii roshni itani teji kar di jaati he ki roshni dwaara din main bhi rangeen prakaash dwaara sanket die ja saken
 Thus modern indicators give the same type of signal at day and night and can be seen from far away
 is prakaar ke sanketak bahut kam sthanon main prayukt hote hai
 In these, the position of two or more lights is indicated and yellow light is used
 america main ek rail prashasan par iskaa prayog hota he
 Red lights report a crisis in transverse state
 45 ansh kone par pili battiyaan satarkta suchak hoti hai tathaa sidhi khadi avasthaa main hari batti 'anukool' kii dyotak hoti hai
 The indicator located in the vault in front of the driver is called the vault indicator and according to the state of the next section, there is a continuous signal in the vault
 yah koshth sanket trek sarkit ke avishkaar dwaara hi sambhav ho paaya he tathaa isaki sahaayta se chaalak ko baraabar yah pataa rahata he ki kitni dur tak aage line saaf he or is prakaar vah usee ke anusaar apni gaadi kii gati par niyantran rakh saktaa he
 In the railway definition, interpolation means controlling the signal and the movement of thorns and crossways in such a way that they do not work against each other
 aitihaasik pragati kaa varnan karte hue bataaya ja chukaa he ki aarambh main antahpashan yantric hota tha par vigyaan kii pragati ke saath antahpashan main bhi vidyut tathaa riley dwaara atyadhik pragati hui tathaa ab kahin-kahin antahpashan kii aisi vyavastha ho gai he ki ek raah sthapit karke uske sanketak anukool hote hi anya sanketak tathaa kaante parpath apane aap is prakaar funs jate hai ki kaante vaale kii galati se bhi kisi virodhabhasi sanchaalan kii sambhaavna nahin rah jaati
 There are mainly two types of interference, mechanical interference and electrical interference
 yantric antahpashan main liver kii chaal se hi anya liveron ke khaanchon main is prakaar yantric fasaav kar diya jaataa he ki virodhabhasi liveron kii chaal ruk jaati he
 In electrical obstruction, the movement of the liver causes such obstruction in the flow of electricity that the conflicting liver cannot run
 vidyut antahpashan kii pragati main nimnlikhit pranaliyaan ullekhneey hai tathaa vibhinn sthanon par kaary main laai ja rahi hai
 In this system, the indicator is injected with the block device in such a way that until the train crosses the section and passes out, line clearing cannot be provided for the other train and the corresponding indicator also cannot be 'adapted'
 vidyut shakti sanchalit sanketakon ke prayog ke baad hi vidyuyantric antahpashan kaa upyog prarambh hua
 Its device is like a mechanical injection device with electrical controllers or livers mounted on it, which stops the movement of other contradictory devices after the movement of one liver
 kaante parpathon tathaa paashon kaa yantric liveron dwaara pipe tathaa lohadand kii sahaayta se parichaalan kiya jaataa he
 Electrical indicators are controlled with the help of electric livers
 is prakaar ke antahpashan ke kaanton ke sanchaalan kaa kaary daabit vaayu dwaara kiya jaataa he tathaa daabit vaayu ke silinderon ke valb i
 kaa niyantran vidyut dwaara hota he
 For this, 12 volts of electricity is used
 kaanton ke sanchaalan ke liye 75 pound prati varg inch ke dabaav kii vaayu prayog main laai jaati he
 This type of machine is used in places where the thorns have to be operated quickly
 is prakaar ke antahpashan main kaanton kii chaal tathaa sanketakon kaa sab kaary vidyut se kiya jaataa he
 Electric motors are installed for handling thorns
 is yantra kaa sanchaalan adhiktar 110 volt disht dhara dwaara hota he par kahin-kahin 119 volt prayavarti dhara bhi kaam main laate hai
 In this interpolation, until the fork achieves its full speed, the indicator cannot show a favorable condition and thus the accident of getting off the line of the car is impossible even when stuck in the middle of the fork
 vidyut sanghnitr antahpashata main bhi yah vyavastha rahati he
 This type of interpolation was used at the vegetable market station near Delhi
 vidyut antahpashan kaa vyavhaar aise sthanon par nahin kiya ja saktaa jahaan barsaat main baadh aakar vidyut motaron ke doobane kaa khatra rahata ho
 Relay interpolation is now being used in place of mechanical interpolation
 riley dwaara vidyut sarkit is prakaar niyantrit kiye jate hai ki yadi ek sarkit kaary kar rahaa he to doosraa sarkit jisamen virdohi sanketak yaa kaanton kii chaal hoti he kaary na kar paae
 With the invention of relay, interpolation work has started to be done very conveniently and large stations can be done with small population in a small space
 riley antahpashan ke baad naveenatam pragati antahpashan kii hui he
 By this, if the operator sets a path by setting it for a train, then all the opposing paths, which are likely to come on the path of another train, become intermittent and cannot be established
 is prakaar ke path, sthapit karne main vividh sanketakon tathaa kaanton kii chaalon ke batano ko dabaanaa padataa he
 Instead, such an arrangement has also started that for setting a path in place of various buttons, the entire path is established by pressing only one button and its signals are in favorable condition
 saath hi sab virdohi path antahpashit ho jate hai jisase ve sthapit na ho saken
 Any established path can also be canceled if another path needs to be replaced in place of that path at some point
 iske liye har path ke liye radd karne vaale batan lage rahete hai
 The system of setting the path with a button is called a control-switch-arrangement and through this the traffic can be very easy even if it is very dense
 path riley antahpashan tathaa ek niyantran-switch-vyavasthaaon main sanchaalak ke saamne saare yard kaa nakshaa rahata he jisaki linon main valbon dwaara roshni ho sakati he
 As soon as a path is established, it lights up and as soon as the car comes on that path, there is a red light instead of white
 gaadi ke path khaali kar dete hi roshni bujh jaati he or doosraa path sthapit kiya ja saktaa he
 In this way, the operator moves rapidly one after the other for the trains coming from different directions
 bharat main riley antahpashan to bahut se sthanon par prayog main laayaa jaataa rahaa he, par madras, bombai, dilli ke kai steshnon par path antahpashan bhi prayukt ha tha
 The control switch system was used at Kurla station near Bombay where the traffic density was very high
 is vyavastha ke dwaara kurlaa main ek hi cabin se 125 bhinn path sthapit kiye ja sakate the, tathaa 50 sanketakon or 94 kaanton kaa sanchaalan vidyutiya daabit vaayu antahpashan pranali se hota tha
 Before July 1959, all this work was done by 272 livers in 6 cabins
 is pranali main har stesan par master ke rakhane kii aavashyaktaa nahin hoti balki ek kendriya sthaan se hi gadiyon kaa niyantran kiya jaataa he
 Remote devices operate the pits and indicators by pressing the button from there
 aisi vyavastha kii jaati he ki yadi chaalak kisi galati ke kaaran sanketak ko 'sankat' dasha main paar kar jaae to pehle to driver ko saavdhaan karne ke liye ek ghanti yaa hooter bajataa he, par yadi gaadi phir bhi na roki jaae to apane aap hi brake lagaakar gaadi ruk jaati he
 In this way, there is safety even if the driver is not able to see the signal due to accident, fainting, fog or for any other reason, the vehicle is not stopped at the 'crisis' signal
 is vyavastha ko swachaalit gaadi roak yaa swachaalit gaadi satarkta vyavastha bhi kehete hai
 Its instrument is in two parts
 ek bhaag to railpath main laga hota he tathaa sanketak ke saath judaa rahata he tathaa doosraa bhaag ingine main laga hota he or sanketak yadi 'anukool' dasha main he tab railpath kaa bhaag bhi anukool hi rahata he or injanavaale bhaag par koi asar nahin padataa
 But if the indicator is in 'crisis' or unfavorable state, then the track portion remains functional and the engine part also becomes functional
 is vyavastha ke ant yaa to yantric yukti ke hote hai yaa vidyut-chumbakeey yukti ke
 In a mechanical device, the engine part collides with the part of the rail path and moves away from its position, which starts the bell ringing and braking
 vidyut chumbakeey yantron main in donon bhaagon ke takaraane kii aavashyaktaa nahin rahati tathaa ek bhaag ke duusare bhaag ke upar se chale jate samay hi chumbakeey prabhaav se kriya shuru ho jaati he
 Due to a mutual collision in the mechanical device, there is a great risk of breakdown in these parts
 anya pragatisheel deshon main to yah vyavastha kaaphi kaam main laai ja rahi he
 In 1944, an Automated Train Control Committee was formed which established G

 Experiments were done in this regard on the railways and came to the conclusion that the goods installed on the track could not be fully protected and the system fails due to its theft
 isaki safalataa ke liye yah aavashyak he ki kisi samay bhi dhokhaa na ho
 Now is not the right time to use it in India
 jab yaa to is baat kii samuchit vyavastha ho jaaegi ki railpath par lage hue yantron ke saath koi chhedchhad na kare yaa phir aise yantra banane lagen ki unke saath chhedchhad ho hi na sake, tabhi is vyavastha kaa prayog bharat main kiya ja sakegaa
 The immune system is a collection of biological processes that occur within an organism that first identify and then kill pathogens and tumor cells and protect that organism from diseases
 yah vishaanuon se lekar paraseete krimiyon jaise vibhinn prakaar ke agent kii pahchaan karne me sakasham hoti he, saath hi yah in agenton ko jeev kii swasth koshikaon or utakon se alag pahchaan sakati he, taaki yah un ke viruddh pratikriya naa kare or puri pranali sucharu rup se kaary kare
 Identifying pathogens is a complex task because the pathogens adapt very rapidly and adapt themselves in such a way that they can successfully infect their nutrients by escaping the immune system
 sharir kii pratiraksha-pranali main kharabi aane se rog main pravesh kar jate hai
 Immune system dysfunction is called immunodeficiency
 immunodefishiency yaa to kisi anuvaanshik rog ke kaaran ho saktaa he, yaa phir kuch khaas dawaaon yaa sankraman ke kaaran bhi sambhav he
 An example of this is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome that spreads due to HIV virus
 thik iske vipareet swapratirakshit rog ek uttejit auto immune system ke kaaran hote hai jo saadhaaran utakon par bahari jeev hone kaa andeh kar un par akraman karata he

 iske adhyayan main pratiraksha pranali sambandhi sabhi bade-chote kaarnon kii jaanch kii jaati he
 In this, knowledge of the beneficial and harmful causes of system based health is done
 pratiraksha pranali ke kshetra main khoj or shodh nirantar jari hai evam isse sambandhit gyaan main nirantar badhottaree hoti ja rahi he
 This system is found in almost all advanced organisms like every plant and animal
 pratiraksha pranali ke kai pratirohak jeevon ko bimariyon se bachaate hai, inamen yantric, rasayan or jaev pratirohak hote hai
 The body's power to prevent infectious diseases is called immunity
 kintu sabhi shaktiyaan pratiraksha main nahin gini jaatin
 The skin does not allow bacteria to enter the body
 amashayik ras kaa amla jeevanuon ko nasht kar detaa he, kintu yah pratiraksha ke antargat nahin aata
 These are natural means of protecting the body
 pratiraksha se arth he brahya proteinon ko rakt main upasthit vishisht vastuon dwaara nasht kar daalane kii shakti
 Bacteria that enter the body produce proteins by dissolving their bodies
 unki nasht kar dene kii shakti rakt main hoti he
 The form of this action is chemical and physical, although this power is natural to some extent, but it is particularly acquired and due to the entry of bacteria and viruses into the body, these things destroy the body
 yah vishisht pratiraksha kehalaati he
 The germs of these diseases are entered into the body of the creature, then the body itself creates the things that destroy them
 yah sakriy rog kshamta he
 To produce it, the thing that is inserted into the body is called a vaccine
 jab ek jantu ke sharir main vaxin pravisht karne se sakriy kshamta utpann ho jaati he, to uske sharir se thodaa rakt nikaalkar, uske serum ko pruthak karke, usko duusare jantu ke sharir main pravisht karne se niskriy kshamta utpann hoti he
 That is, the body of one animal produces those bactericidal items and these immune items are entered into the body of another animal and they are endowed with curative power
 yah hui niskriy pratiraksha
 It is used a lot in medicine
 diphtheria, titanas aadi rogon kii isi prakaar taiyaar kiye gaye antitoxic serum se chikitsa kii jaati he
 Blood has many types of bactericidal powers
 rakt kii shwet kanikaon main jeevanu tathaa sab bahya vastuon ko kha jane kii shakti hoti he
 This function is called bacteriology
 rakt jeevanuon ko galaa detaa he, jo jeevanulayan kaha jaataa he
 The reason for this is a chemical substance present in the blood, which is called bacteriolysin
 rakt main jeevanuon ko baandh dene kii bhi shakti hoti he
 The infectious animals reach the body and are made from a bunch of bacteria
 unki gatishakti nasht ho jaati he
 This phenomenon is called agglutination and the object that causes it is called agglutinin
 jeevanu sharir main jeevvish utpann karte hai
 The immune bacterium also produces powers that kill these poisons, which are called antigenic poisons
 ye vishisht vastuen hoti hai
 The disease against which immunity is done, it destroys or destroys the bacteria of the same disease
 yahi vishisht pratiraksha kehalaati he
 Blood also has the power to dissolve the blood cells of other animals, which is called bleeding
 sakriy pratiraksha utpann karne ke liye rogon ke jeevanuon ko sharir main pravisht kiya jaataa he
 Immunity against bacteria is produced by the bacteria of a single disease
 pravisht karne se purv jeevanuon kii shakti or sankhya donon ko itnaa gata diya jaataa he ki usase jantu ko haani na pahunche, arthath itnaa bhayankar rog na ho ki uski mrityu ho jaay
 With this first volume, the animal gets a mild attack of disease, but things start destroying those bacteria in his body
 jin vastuon ko pravisht kiya jaataa he, ve pratijan kehalaati hai or unase rakt main pratipind banate hai
 a few days later a second quantity of animals is given, in which the number of bacteria is already two times or more
 jantu isko bhi sahan kar letaa he
 After a few days, a third dose is given, which is more than the second
 isse bhi jantu kuch hi din main ubar aata he
 Similarly, the quantity is increased equally until the animal tolerates several hundred times more than the first
 is samay tak jantu ke rakt main bahut badi maatra main pratipind ban chuktaa he
 Hence the animal is completely immune
 rogon ke akraman main bhi yahi hoti he
 Antibodies are formed in the body
 yahi sakriy pratiraksha hoti he
 To produce it, the solution of bacteria which is entered in the body is usually called vaccine
 is prakaar kii pratiraksha chirsthayee bhi hoti he
 After generating the appropriate capacity, after separating the serum from the blood of that animal, after being purified by chemical methods, it is used for healing
 jab is serum ko rogi ke sharir main pravisht kiya jaataa he, to usamen niskriy pratiraksha utpann hoti he, arthath serum main upasthit pratipindon ke kaaran uskaa sharir to pratiraksha se sampann ho jaataa he, kintu rogi kaa sharir pratiraksha utpann nahin karata
 Antibodies and antibodies that produce immunity are produced by another body
 keval rogi ke sharir main pravisht kar die jate hai
 Serum is used in the treatment of diseases
 serum main upasthit prativish kii maatra nirdhaarit kar lee gai he or usko antarrashtriya ekank kaha jaataa he
 It is used for both prevention and treatment
 nimnlikhit rogon kii vishesh oshadhi antiserum he : 1
 Diphtheria - The special action of its organism is the destruction of the local tissues, the decay of the muscles of the heart, the destruction of the umbilical cord, leading to endemic paralysis
 sharir ke samast utakon par uskaa vishaiylla prabhaav hota he
 Antivirus resolves this poison, but its quantity should be sufficient for the amount of venom
 yah bhalee bhanti pramanit ho chukaa he ki prativish isaki vishisht oshadhi he
