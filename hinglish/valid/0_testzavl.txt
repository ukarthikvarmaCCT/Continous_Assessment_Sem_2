 There have been revolutionary changes in the field of electrical energy due to power electronics
 aaj 10 wat se lekar kai sau megawatt ke motaron ko chalaane ke liye drive uplabdh hai
 Electric power up to 6 GW can be transmitted via high-voltage DC transmission of about 1000 kw
 railgadiyaan, alevator, or crinen sabhi shakti electronic ke dwaara hi aaraam se chal rahe hai
 Power is the only component in connecting renewable energy sources to the electric grid
 yahan tak ki radar pranali bhi shakti electronic par hi nirbhar he
 Although all small electronic components are used in power electronics, the following components are unique identities of power electronics
 shakti electronic ke kshetra main kaary, laghu-sanket-electraniki ke bhi pehle ho chukaa tha
 Electric machines were first used for the control and conversion of electric power
 iske baad mercury arq ractifire kaa prayog hua
 Then came the era of vacuum and gas-filled valves
 san 1957 main esasiaar ke vikaas se shakti electronic main ek nayi disha mili
 Nowadays, the use of switches like SCR, GTO, BJT, MOSFET, IGBT, etc
 is done very efficiently
 is kaaran shakti electronic kaa kshetra bahut vyapak evam mahatvapurn ho gaya he
 Electronics is the department of science in which electric power is efficiently converted to the desired voltage, frequency, current by using electron tubes or semiconductor devices performing similar functions
 vastav main baat yah he ki vidyut shakti hame jis rup main main praapt hoti he usee rup main vah bahut kam upyog main laayi jaati he
 For example, an industry receives electric power in the form of 415 volts, 50 Hz AC
 use vidyutlepan karnaa he jiske liye 0 se 20 volt disi chaiye jisamen se shunya se lekar 1200 ampir dhara bahegi
 It is clear that the power we are getting cannot be directly used for this work, rather it will have to be changed
 yah kaam shakti electraniki dwaara kiya jaataa he
 In fact, there are thousands of examples where electric power cannot be used as it is, rather it has to be changed to some other form
 electraneey yuktiyon main se mahatvapurn upyog ye hai : Many of today's most modern devices also cannot be made without electronics, such as radio, television, movies, fluorescence light, public lecture-system, telephone etc
 ye sab yuktiyaan electraniki kii hi dein hai
 Some of the industrial uses of electronics are briefly mentioned below: udyogon main bahudhaa rujukarak upyog main laae jate hai, jinase prayavarti vidyut-dhara nirdisht dhara main badali jaati he
 They are often of one of the following types: adhik shakti ke rujukari main bahukala rujukari paripathon kaa upyog ekkala rujukari paripathon ke upyog kii upeksha anek kaarnon se adhik laabhadaayak hota he
 The first reason is that nowadays electric power is produced and distributed in the form of tri-art-power
 dwitiya kaaran yah he ki bahukala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata ekkala rujukari dwaara utpann voltata kii apeksha adhik sam hoti he
 In the above mentioned high power loan, either the same loan is kept for many moneylenders or many money bankers, whose loan lines are connected, are used
 donon hi prakaar ke runagra prayog main laae jate hai
 The speed of the motor is controlled exclusively in paper mills, because the thickness of the paper depends on the speed itself
 in yantron main exciter ke kshetra kii pravaati dhara main parivartan kiya jaataa he, jo janitr ke liye niyantrak kshetra kaa utpaadan karata he
 This generator is driven by a prime mover
 janitr kaa armechar apana utpaadan us motor ko detaa he jisaki chaal kaa niyantran karnaa hota he
 a sight-current generator is driven by this motor; It produces a voltage proportional to its speed
 yadi vah voltata purvanishchit voltata se bhinn hoti he to ek niamak ko sakriy kar detii he
 This regulator brings about such a change in the area of the exciter that the current of the motor falls to a predetermined value
 is niamak main anek naliyon kaa upyog hota he
 Thus with the help of electronics, the speed of the motor can be controlled to a minimum value

 When a transducer is placed between two plates of the capacitor and the capacitor is connected to a powerful high frequency generator, a loss current increases the heat of the transducer and the air begins to melt
 is prakaar kaa niyam prerana dwaara garam karne ke liye bhi he
 These tips are more beneficial than ordinary heating
 udyog main vastuon ko tapt karne ke liye vidyut kaa bahut prayog hota he
 By this method the work is very clean and an open flame is not present
 dhaatuon ko tapt karne ke kii vidhi ko preran-taapan tathaa achaalak vastuon ko tapt karne kii vidhi ko paravidhyut-taapan kehete hai
 Both of these methods require high frequency alternating current
 tapt kii janevaali dhaatu ke tukade ke chaaron ore ek kundali lapetakar usamen prayavarti dhara kaa pravaah karte hai
 The magnetic current generated by the current flows through the air and also through the metal present near the coil
 dhara ke utkraman se syand main bhi parivartan hota he, jiske kaaran dhaatu main voltata prerit ho jaati he
 Due to this voltage, a large amount of vortex current flows in the metal
 tab dhaatu ke pratirodh ke kaaran taap utpann ho jaataa he
 a power of 1,000 kilocycles or more than 1 meg of cycle is required to electrically conduct dielectric materials
 chunki vastu main hokar dhara pravaahit nahin ho sakati, isliye vastu ko ucch voltatawaale dhaatu ke platon ke bich main rakhaa jaataa he
 Due to the rapid change of the electric field, the changes in the molecule structure of the dielectric object also begin
 anuon ke bich main gharshan hone ke kaaran vastu main sab ore samaan taap utpann ho jaataa he
 By this method, thick sheets of dielectric objects can be heated in a very short time
 dhaatu ke do tukdon main ucch vidyut-dhara pravaahit karne se unako sandhanit kiya ja saktaa he, arthath mashin main ek sandhan parivartak rahata he, jo 220 yaa 440 volt kii vidyut kii do vidyut-dagron ke bich main se 1 se 10 voltmapi main parivartit kar detaa he or saath hi saath ucch vidyuddhara detaa he
 To make a break, it is necessary that the current flows only for a short time

 Kamal Ataturk alias Mustafa Kamal Pasha is said to be the creator of modern Turkey
 turki ke samrajyavaadee shaasha sultan abdul hamid dwitiya kaa pasa palat kar vahaan kamaal kii saamaajik, raajnneetik va aarthik vyavastha kaayam karne kaa jo krantikari kaary unhone kiya us aitihaasik kaary ne unke naam ko sarthak siddh kar diya
 Kamal Pasha was born on 19 May 1881 in a peasant family in Salonika
 inaki mata kaa naam juvaida va pita kaa ali raja tha
 Ali Raza was a clerk in Salonika's octroi office
 unka bachapan kaa naam mustafa tha
 The father died a few years after his birth
 mata jubaida ne majahabi talim dilaane ke uddeshy se madrase main daakhil kara diya jahaan unke senior chatro ke tang karne par vah marane maarane par utar aaye
 At the age of just 11, he had become so bad that he had to be removed from Maktab
 baad main unhen monastir ke sainik skool main bhartee karaayaa gaya
 But there too, his die-hard extremist nature remained, but due to his interest in military education, his studies continued unabated, there was no disruption in him
 balak mustafa ugr avashya tha parantu ganit main uski gati aashcharya janak thi
 As soon as he wrote a question on the black board of the teacher, he used to solve it by force
 usamen kamaal kii kaabiliyat dekhakar skool ke ganit adhyaaapak captain mustafa ufindi ne naam badal kar kamaal rakh diya
 Only then did he become known as Kamal Pasha
 17 saal kii umr main monastir ke primary sainik skool main praarambhik sainya shiksha praapt karne ke baad unhen kustuntuniya ke staff kalege main ucch sainya shiksha hetu bhej diya gaya
 In those days, there was the Sultanate of Abdul Hameed in Kustuntunia and his crown was called Sultan
 vahaan vah adhyayan ke saath-saath buree sangat main ghoomte rahe
 After spending a brief period of arrogant life, he became the first member of a secret revolutionary party called Watan and became its leader only a few days later
 vatan kaa uddeshy ek taraf sultan kii taanaashaahee or duusari taraf videshi shadyantron ko jad se mitaanaa tha
 One day the meeting of the party was going on that some intelligence gave news to the Sultan and all the conspiracy officers were arrested and sent to jail
 prachlit kanoon ke anusaar un sabko mrityudand diya ja saktaa tha, par durbalchitt sultan ko bhay tha ki kahin aisa karne par desh main vidroh na bhadak uthe, at: usne sabkon kshamaadaan dene kaa nishchay kiya
 Thus, along with other soldiers, Kamal was also left in pardon
 tatpashchaat sultan ne druj jati ke vidroh ko dabaane ke liye unhen damishq bhej diya
 There Kamal did a wonderful job, but according to his nature he returned to Kustantunia and after opening a room in Stambool, he opened the office of watan-o-hurriyat Party and started the work of the secret organization of freedom in it
 isi bich unhen yah gyaat hua ki macedoniya main sultan ke viruddh khulaa vidroh hone vaala he
 Sensing the exaggeration of the occasion, Kamal took leave from the Sultan's army and disguised as Jaffa, Mirua and Athens and reached Salonika, the center of the rebellion
 parantu vahaan par unhen pahchaan liya gaya
 Then he ran towards Jaffa via Greece
 par tab tak unki giraftaar kaa aadesh vahaan bhi pahunch chukaa tha
 An officer named Ahmed Bay had the burden of capturing Kamal, but since Ahmed himself was a member of the country, he instead of arresting Kamal sent him to the Gaza front and sent a report to the Sultan that he had not gone on leave
 Were
 yadhyapi kamaal salonika main bahut thode samay tak hi rah paye, phir bhi unhone yah bhalee-bhanti samaj liya tha ki salonika ko hi vidroh kaa kendra bananaa thik rahegaa, isaliye bade prayatnon ke baad san 1908 main unhone apana sthaanantaran salonika hi karvaa liya
 Here two years ago under the leadership of Anwar, a revolutionary party was established in the name of unity and progress committee
 kamaal tatkaal uske sadsy ban gayi, parantu dal ke netaaon se unki nahin baniin
 Nevertheless, he continued to do the work of the committee
 is dal ke ek netaa niyazi ne keval kuch sau aadamiyon ko lekar turki sarkaar ke viruddh vidroh bol diya
 Although it was a matter of great stupidity, but since the whole country was ready, the army that was sent to fight it also went to Anwar
 is prakaar desh main anwar kaa jai-jayakaar ho gaya
 Now the co-operative army was preparing to attack the capital
 sultan ne inhen dinon kuch shashan-sudhaar bhi kiye
 Even then the powers of the rebellion continued to work, but when the rebellion was successful, Sultan Abdul Hameed joined some of the army with enough bribe, which led the soldiers to revolt and kill their officers and once more Islam, Slogans of Sultan and Khalifa's Jai were raised
 in dinon anwar berlin main the
 He soon returned and he put Abdul Hameed on the throne and hanged several reactionary leaders
 is prakaar anwar kii krantikari samiti ke haath main prashasnic shakti aa gayi
 In order to confound the general public, the Sultan's nephew was placed on the throne
 idhar kamaal pasha anwar ke viruddh nirantar shadyantr karte rahe kyonki unke vichaar se anwar beshak adarshavaadi the kintu avyaavhaarik adhik vyakti the
 Despite all this, Anwar continuously thwarted the foreign invasions that occurred at that time, this increased Anwar's fame in public
 iske baad anwar ne apane sarv islamic swapn ko satya karne ke liye kaary armbh kiya or unhone iske liye sabase pehla kaam yah kiya ki turki sena ko sangathit karne kaa bhaar ek german general ko diya
 Kamal started the movement against this, saying that this is an insult to the Turkish race
 is par kamaal ko sainik doot banaakar sofia bhej diya gaya
 Meanwhile, the great war broke out
 isamen anwar safal nahin ho sake, par kamaal ne ek yuddh main kustantuniya par adhikaar karne kii british chaal ko vifal kar diya or uske baad unki jeet par jeet hoti chali gayi
 Nevertheless, Turkey was defeated in the Great War
 kamaal din raat parishram karke videshiyon ke viruddh aandolan karte rahe
 Sevra's treaty was announced in 1920, but its conditions were so bad that Kamal immediately prepared an army and prepared to attack Kustuntunia
 isi bich greece ne turki par hamalaa kar diya or smarana main sena utaar di jo kamaal ke pradhan kendra angaara kii taraf badhane lagi
 Now a big problem has arisen for Kamal, because if they lose in this war, then there is no possibility
 isaliye unhone badi taiyaari ke saath yuddh kiya jiskaa parinaam yah hua ki dhire-dhire greek sena ko peeche hatana padaa
 Meanwhile, France and Russia also started secretly assisting Kamal
 thode dinon main hi greek nikaal baahar kiye gaye
 Only after exorcising the Greeks, there was a question of removing the remaining parts from the British
 desh unke saath tha, iske atirikt britain ab ladane ke liye bilkul taiyaar nahin tha
 For this reason this problem was also solved
 kamaal ne desh ko prajatantra ghoshit kiya or swayan pratham raashtrapati bane
 Now the state was almost dead, but there was constant opposition from the Mullahs
 isapar kamaal ne sarkari akhabaaron main islam ke viruddh prachaar shuru kiya
 Now the religious leaders have issued fatwa against them and started saying that Kamal has propagated modern dance in the country by taking women out of the curtains in Angora, in which men dance with women, it should end
 har masjid se yah aawaaj uthaayi gayi
 Then Kamal ended the Khilafat system in March 1924 and introduced a bill in Parliament declaring Turkey as a secular nation
 adhikansh sansad sadasyon ne iskaa virodh kiya, par kamaal ne unhen kasake dhamkaaya
 His threat was strongly affected and the bill was passed
 par bheetar-bheetar mullaon ke vidroh kii aag baraab sulagati rahi
 Many of Kamal's former friends were reunited with the mullahs
 in logon ne videshi poonjipatiyon se dhan bhi liya tha
 Kamal arrested his main leaders and hanged him one day
 kamaal ne dekha ki keval phaansi par chadhaane se kaam nahin chalegaa, desh ko aadhunik rup se shikshit karnaa he tathaa puraane reeti rivaajon ko hi nahin, pahanaave aadi ko bhi samaapt karnaa he
 Kamal made his first attack on the Turkish cap
 is par vidroh hue, par kamaal ne sena bhej di
 After this, they removed Islamic laws and replaced them with a new code which included all the good things of Switzerland, Germany and Italy
 bahu-vivaah gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 Along with this, husbands were told not to treat their wives like drums and to treat them equally
 prayek vyakti ko vot kaa adhikaar diya gaya
 Bribes were prohibited in services and severe bribes were given to bribes
 striyon ke pahanaave se pardaa uthaa diya gaya or purush puraane dhang ke pariched chhodkar suut pahanane lage
 An even greater improvement was that the Roman script was replaced by the Arabic script
 kamaal swayan sadakon par jaakar roman varna-maala main turki bhashaa padhaate rahe
 As a result, the whole of Turkey became united and the feeling of isolation ended
 iske saath hi kamaal ne turki sena ko atyant aadhunik dhang se sangathit kiya
 Thus the Ottoman caste became the modern caste due to Kamal Pasha
 san 1938 ke navambar maas kii 10 taarikh ko mustafaa kamaal ataturk kii mrityu hui tab tak aadhunik turki ke nirmaataa ke rup main unka naam sansar main suraj kii tarah chamak chukaa tha
 Although Kamal Pasha had four love affairs with four women in his life, but he married only Latifi Ussaki
 yadhyapi usase kamaal ko koi santaan nahin hui or vah nissantan hi mar gayi
 After Bibi's death, Mustafa Kamal Pasha never married

 Despite the decisive participation of this song in the freedom struggle, when it came to the selection of the national anthem, Jana Gana Mana, a song written and sung by Rabindranath Thakur, was given preference over Vande Mataram
 isaki vajah yahi thi ki kuch musalamaanon ko "vande maataram" gane par aapatti thi, kyonki is geet main devi durga ko raashtra ke rup main dekha gaya he
 Apart from this, he also believed that the Anand Math novel from which this song was taken was written against Muslims

 The song Vande Mataram is also being debated
 is geet ke pehle do band, jo ki praasangik hai, main koi bhi muslim virdohi baat nahin he or na hi kisi devi yaa durga kii aradhana he
 But these people say that- haalaanki aisa nahin he ki bharat ke sabhi musalamaanon ko is par aapatti he yaa sab hindu ise gane par jor dete hai
 It is also worth mentioning that a few years ago, the famous music composer AR Rahman, himself a Muslim, had prepared a music album about Vande Mataram which became very popular

 yah bhagwaan shiv kaa pramukh parv he
 Phalgun Krishna Chaturdashi is celebrated Shivaratri festival

 According to mythology, the creation of this day began with the rise of Agnilinga
 adhik tar log yah manyata rakhte he ki isi din bhagwaan shiv kaa vivaah devi parvati ke saath hua tha
 Mahashivaratri is considered to be the most important of the 12 Shivaratris that occur in the year
 kashmir shaiva mat main is tyohaar ko har-raatri or bolchaal main 'herath' yaa 'herath' bhi jaataa he
 There are many mythological stories related to Mahashivaratri: mahashivaratri ke din bhagwaan shiv ne kalkut naamak vish ko apane kanth main rakh liya tha
 Which came out at the time of churning the sea
 ek baar parvati ji ne bhagwaan shivashankar se poocha, 'aisa koun-sa shreshth tathaa saral vrath-pujan he, jisase mrityulok ke praani aapaki krupa sahaj hi praapt kar lete hai?' uttar main shivaji ne parvati ko 'shivaratri' ke vrath kaa vidhaan bataakar yah katha sunai- 'ek baar chitrabhanu naamak ek shikari tha
 He raised his family by killing animals
 vah ek sahuukaar kaa rini tha, lekin uskaa rin samay par na chukaa sakaa
 The angry moneylender captives the hunter at Shivamath
 sanyog se us din shivaratri thi
 ' shikari dhyanamgn hokar shiv-sambandhi dharmik baaten sunata rahaa
 He also heard the story of Shivaratri fast on Chaturdashi
 sandhya hote hi sahuukaar ne use apane paas bulaayaa or rin chukaane ke vishay main baat kii
 The hunter left the bond the next day, promising to return the loan
 apni dincharya kii bhaanti vah jangal main shikaar ke liye niklaa
 But due to being in captivity all day, he was disturbed by hunger and thirst
 shikaar karne ke liye vah ek talab ke kinare bel-vriksh par padaav banane laga
 Under the vine tree was the Shivling which was covered with villas
 shikari ko uskaa pataa na chalaa
 The twigs he broke while making the halt fell on the Shivling by chance
 is prakaar dinabhar bhukhe-pyaase shikari kaa vrath bhi ho gaya or shivlinga par belptr bhi chadh gaye
 At one o'clock in the night, a pregnant lady came to drink water at the pond
 shikari ne dhanush par tir chadhaakar jyon hi pratyancha khinchi, mrigi boli, 'main garbhini hum
 Will deliver soon tum ek saath do jeevon kii hatya karoge, jo thik nahin he
 i will give birth to a child and will be presented to you soon, then kill it
 ' shikari ne pratyancha dhili kar di or mrigi junglee jhaadiyon main lupt ho gai
 Shortly after, another antelope emerged from there
 shikari kii prasannataa kaa thikaana na rahaa
 After coming close, he put the bow on the arrow
 tab use dekh mrigi ne vinamratapurvak nivedan kiya, 'he pardhi! main thodi der pehle ritu se nivrutt hui hum
 i am lustful
 apane priy kii khoj main bhatak rahi hum
 i will meet my husband and come to you soon
 ' shikari ne use bhi jane diya
 He was perturbed over losing his prey twice
 vah chintaa main pad gaya
 The last hour of the night was passed
 tabhi ek anya mrigi apane bacchon ke saath udhar se nikali
 It was a golden opportunity for hunters
 usne dhanush par tir chadhaane main der nahin lagaai
 He was about to drop the arrow that the antelope said, 'O Pardhi!' i will return these children to their father
 is samay mujhe mat maaro
 The hunter laughed and said, leave the victim in front, i am not such a fool
 isse pehle main do baar apana shikaar kho chukaa hum
 My children must be suffering from hunger and thirst
 uttar main mrigi ne phir kaha, jaise tumhen apane bacchon kii mamata sata rahi he, thik vaise hi mujhe bhi
 Therefore, in the name of children, i am seeking life for a while
 he pardhi! meraa vishwaas kar, main inhen inke pita ke paas chhodkar turant lautne kii pratigya karti hum
 Hearing the deer's low voice, the hunter felt pity on him
 usne us mrigi ko bhi jane diya
 In the absence of hunting, the hunter sitting on the vine tree was being thrown down by breaking the bell-sheet
 pau fatne ko hui to ek hrisht-pusht mrug usee raste par aayaa
 The hunter thought that he would surely hunt it
 shikari kii tani pratyancha dekhakar mrigvinith swar main bolaa, he pardhi bhai! yadi tumne mujhase purv aane vaali teen mrigiyon tathaa chote-chote bacchon ko maar daalaa he, to mujhe bhi maarane main vilamb na karo, taaki mujhe unke viyog main ek kshan bhi dukh na sahanaa pade
 i am the husband of those deer
 yadi tumne unhen jeevandaan diya he to mujhe bhi kuch kshan kaa jivan dene kii krupa karo
 i will meet you and appear before you
 mrug kii baat sunate hi shikari ke saamne puri raat kaa ghatnachakra gum gaya, usne sari katha mrug ko suna di
 Then the deer said, 'the way my three wives have gone as promised, i will not be able to follow my religion with my death
 atah jaise tumne unhen vishwaasapaatr maanakar choda he, vaise hi mujhe bhi jane do
 i will appear before you soon with all of them
 ' upwas, raatri-jaagran tathaa shivlinga par belptr chadhane se shikari kaa hinsak hriday nirmal ho gaya tha
 Bhagavad Shakti was in him
 dhanush tathaa baan uske haath se sahaj hi chhot gaya
 Due to the compassion of Lord Shiva, his violent heart filled with compassionate feelings
 vah apane ateet ke karmon ko yaad karke pashchaatap kii jwaala main jalane laga
 Shortly afterwards, the antelope appeared before the family hunter, so that he could hunt them, but the hunter was very sorry for seeing such veracity, sattvikta and collective love of wild animals
 uske netron se aansuon kii jhadi lag gai
 By not killing that antelope family, the hunter removed his hard heart from living violence and made him soft and kind forever
 devloak se samast dev samaaj bhi is ghatana ko dekh rahe the
 As soon as the event ended, the Gods and Goddesses made flowers
 tab shikari tathaa mrug parivaar moksh ko praapt hue'

 Seismic codes are building codes that are designed to reduce the loss of life and buildings due to earthquakes
 ek prasiddh kahawat he ki logon ko bhucamp nahin martha balki bhawan maarthe hai
 Landscapes generated during earthquakes create force and deformation in buildings
 isliye imaaraton ko aise balon or virupanon kaa saamana karne kii drushti se taiyaar karnaa aavashyak he
 Seismic codes help to improve the behavior of buildings so that they are able to withstand the effects of earthquakes and do not cause much loss of life and property
 dizin ejiniyaron ko imaaraton kii yojana, dizine, vistrutikaran tathaa nirmaan main sahaayta uplabdh karaane ke liye vishwa bhar ke deshon main bukampi kodon main kriyavidhiyon kii ruparekhaayen taiyaar kii gai hai
 a seismic building has the following four characteristics: bukampi code in sabhi pahaluon par dhyaan kendrit karte hai
 Highly developed seismic codes have been produced in countries with a history of earthquakes
 atah japan, newjiland tathaa america jaise deshon ke paas vistrut bukampi code praavdhaan maujuud hai
 The development of codes for buildings in India began soon
 aaj bharat main bukampi kodon kii ek acchhee-khaasi suchi maujuud he jo vibhinn prakaar kii imaaraton par lagu hote hai, jinamein mitti yaa kam majboot chinai vaale gharon se lekar aadhunik bhawan tak shaamil hai
 However, the key to ensuring seismic safety lies in a robust system that can follow and implement these design code provisions in actual constructions
 bukampi code kisi kshetra vishesh yaa desh ke liye usee ke anuroop hote hai
 They take into account local seismology, acceptable levels of hazard, building designs and materials and methods used in construction
 saath hi, kisi desh dwaara bukampi ejiniyari ke kshetra main kii gai pragati ke bhi ve suchak hote hai
 The first formal seismic code named IS 1893 was published in India in 1962
 vartmaan main bhartiya maanak beuro ke antargat nimnlikhit bukampi code aate hai
 Regulations made in these standards do not ensure that no damage to structures will occur during earthquakes with all consequences
 lekin, ek sambhav seemaa tak ve yah sunishchit karte hai ki sanrachanaatmak kshati ke bina sanrachanaayen madhyam tivrataon ke bukampon tathaa purna rup se dhwast hue bina ucch tivrataon ke bukampon ke prati anukriya pradarshit karne main sakasham hai
