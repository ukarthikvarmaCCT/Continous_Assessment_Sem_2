 Svetambara Terapanth is the name of a branch of the Svetambara Sangha in Jainism
 iskaa udbhav vikram sanwat 1817 main hua
 It was enforced by Muni Bhikhan who later became known as Acharya monk
 ve multah sthandwasi sangh ke sadsy or acharya raghunatha ji ke shishy the
 When Acharya Sant Bhikhan ji had boycotted procrastination, inspired by the spirit of autobiography, there was no talk of establishing a new union before him
 parantu jaindharm ke mul tatwon kaa prachaar evam sadhusangh main ai hui shithilataa ko dur karnaa tha
 He remained steadfast in his path, not caring for the sufferings
 sanstha ke namakaran ke bare main bhi unhone kabhi nahin sochaa tha, phir bhi sanstha kaa naam terapanth ho hi gaya
 The reason for this is the following incident
 jodhpur main ek baar acharya bhikshu ke siddhanton ko maananevaale 13 shravak ek duukaan main baithkar samayik kar rahe the
 From there, the then Diwan Fatehsinhji passed through Sindhi and saw why the listeners are doing time here
 unhone iskaa kaaran poocha
 In the north, the Shravakas said that Shriman our Saint Bhikhan ji has left the places
 ve kehete hai, ek ghar ko chhodkar gaanv gaanv main sthand banvaanaa saadhuon ke liye uchit nahin he
 We also agree with his views
 isaliye yahan samayik kar rahe hai
 On Diwan Ji's request, he narrated all the details, at that time, a servant caste poet was listening to the whole incident
 usne tatkaal 13 kii sankhya ko dhyaan main lekar ek doha kah daalaa-- Just this incident became the name of Terapanth
 jab swami ji ko is baat kaa pataa chalaa ki hamaara naam terapanthi pad gaya he to unhone tatkaal asana chhodkar bhagwaan ko namaskara karte hue is shabd kaa arth kiya -- he bhagwaan yah tera panth he
 We have accepted your creed
 at: tera panthi he
 Acharya Sant Bhikhan ji first wrote a Maryadapatra to organize the Sadhu Sanstha
 usamen unhone likhaa ki -- All sages and goddesses should be under the command of one teacher
 vartmaan acharya hi bhavi acharya kaa nirvachan karen
 No monk should break the discipline
 anushaasan bhang karne par sangh se tatkaal bahishkrut kar diya jaae
 No monk should make a separate disciple

 Where the Acharya says, let the monastery do chaturmas
 apane icchaanusaar na kare
 Have allegiance to Acharya, etc

 There are currently 651 monk saints in the Terapant Sangh

 prayek varg ko "singhada" kaha jaataa he
 These Singhada are doing non-violence propagating in various parts of India, Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat, Saurashtra, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Bharat, Bihar, Bengal etc

 at: uski raksha ke liye anya kuch praaniyon kaa vadh saamaajik kshetra main maanya hone par bhi dharmik kshetra main maanya nahin ho saktaa kyonki dharm maanavtawaad ko maanakar nahin chalata
 Religion is not in rape but in turning heart
 dharm paison se nahin kharida ja saktaa
 It is located in the soul's satravaritas
 jahaan hinsa he, vahaan dharm nahin ho saktaa
 Religion is in renunciation, not enjoyment
 har jati or har varg kaa manushya dharm karne kaa adhikari he
 There is no distinction of caste and class in religion

 Terapanth's pedagogy also operates on the basis of ancient guru tradition
 saare sangh main koi bhi vaitanaik pandit nahin rahata
 The Acharya himself makes everyone study, and then those educated sages and sages for the younger ones
 isi parampara ke aadhaar par parikshaayen hoti hai, jinamein vyakaran, nyaay, darshan, kosh, aagam aadi kaa adhyayan hota he

 All such subjects come under cultural anthropology

 Other subjects study a part of human activity

 In this way both culture and language develop equally
 aadi samskritiyon main bhashaaon kii vividhta tathaa unke swaroop kii jatilta main anusandhan kii aseem saamagree he
 Just as we can solve cultural mysteries by analyzing the nature of language, in the same way, knowledge of structural elements and processes of cultures can give us a wider light on some problems of philology

 Hatha Yoga is an ancient Indian cultivation method of introverting the flow of Chittavatras by preventing them from moving towards the world, in which an attempt is made to awaken the dormant Kundalini above the pulse path and stabilize it in various chakras and take it to the topmost Sahastrar Chakra
 Is transported
 hathyog pradipika iskaa pramukh granth he
 Hatha Yoga is one of the many forms of yoga
 yoga ke anya prakaar ye hai- mantrayog, layayog, rajyog
 After the emergence of Hatha Yoga, the ancient 'ashtanga Yoga' was called 'raja Yoga'
 hathyog sadhana kii mukhya dhara shaiva rahi he
 It was adopted by the Siddhas and later the Naths
 matsyendra nath tathaa gorakh nath uske pramukh acharya maane gaye hai
 Gorakhnath's followers mainly practiced Hatha Yoga
 unhen nath yogi bhi kaha jaataa he
 In addition to Shaivism, Buddhists also adopted the method of Hatha Yoga
 hathyog ke bare main logon kii dharna he ki hath shabd ke hath + ach pratyay ke saath 'prachandta' yaa 'bal' arth main prayukt hota he
 When used as an adjective, Hathen or Hatha, it is taken to mean forcefully or forcefully, suddenly or viciously
 'hath vidya' streeling arth main 'balpurvak manan karne' ke vigyaan ke arth main grahan kiya jaataa he
 In this way, people generally know Hatha Yoga as a yoga in which some physical and mental activities are done with hatha
 isi kaaran saamaanya sharir shodhan kii prakriyaaon se hatakar kii jane vaali sharir shodhan kii shat kriyaaon ko hathyog maan liya jaataa he
 However, it is not like that
 shatkarm to keval sharir shodhan ke saadhan he vastav main hathyog to sharir evam man ke santulan dwaara rajyog praapt karne kaa purv sopan ke rup main vistrut yoga vigyaan kii chaar shakhaon main se ek shakha he
 In the field of cultivation, this meaning of the word Hatha Yoga is used in the sense of the word made by mixing the seeds and the seeds
 jisamen ha yaa han tathaa tha yaa than ke aneko arth kiye jate hai
 For example, from Pingala nadi to Dahini Nasal and from Ida Nadi to Bony Nasal
 ida rinatmak urja shakti evam piganla dhanatmak urja shakti kaa santulan evam ityadi ityadi
 The sum or similarity of both these nostrils is taken in the sense of a vowel or prana running in the mid-center or sushumna nadi
 is prakaar ha or tha kaa yoga praanon ke aayam se arth rakhata he
 This type of pranayama is the process and yoga of that means that hatha yoga, which removes the inertia of the whole body, the excess of life makes the pulse chakras strong and conscious and the person develops various physical, intellectual and spiritual powers
 is
 sthool rup se hath yoga athwa pranayam kriya teen bhaagon main puri kii jaati he - In this way, it is Hatha Yoga to speed the souls with its control
 yah hathyog rajyog kii siddhi ke liye aadharbhumi banaata he
 Achieving Raja Yoga without the practice of hatha yoga is a very difficult task
 atah hathyog kii sadhana siddh hone par rajyog kii ore aage badhane main sahajata hoti he
 The Upanishads describe four types of yogas according to the four types of cults, these are- maharishi patanjali kaa yoga darshan rajyog ke arntagat aata he
 In this opinion, the prevention of mind attitude is considered to be yoga

 The Shakta, Shaivite, Vaishnavite, etc
 prevalent at the present time are accepted by the name of God Pranidhan
 isi paatanjal yoga sutara ke bhashyakarta shri vedavyas ji ne ise nimnlikhit prakaar se spasht karne kii koshish kii he- Bhoja has explained it in the following way: arthath kaleshaadi se rahit ishwar tatv ko anek naamon se shastron main kaha gaya hai isliye usko koi ek sangya nahin di ja sakati
 Hence Vyas commentary states: - isliye shiv, vishnu, mahashakti aadi naam tathaa inke naamon se puranadi grathon kii rachana karke tattadbhaavna bhavati-bhaktti yoga kii pravriti maharishi vyas dwaara kii gai hai
 Jiva is a part of God and yoga can not be created if there is Kaleshadi living in a fraction
 is hetu kleshadi ko hataanaa aavashyak ho jaataa he
 In accordance with deeds, a person absorbs the body and transmits emotion
 ye bhavanaaen satvik, rajsik evam tamsik prakaar kii hoti he
 To reconcile the feelings of these different forms, the types of yogas also vary
 maansik bhaavana hi kriyaaon ke karm, akarm tathaa vikarm banane main mul hetu he
 Even if one sees the nature of karma, there is a difference in their appearance and results due to difference in mental feeling
 maitryshupanishad main is tathy ko nimnaankit prakaar se kaha gaya he - That is, the mind of man only causes both bondage and salvation
 vishyon main aasakt hone se bandhan ho jaataa he tathaa vishyon main aasakt na hone par moksh ho jaataa he
 In the Srimad Bhagavat Gita also, in the eleventh chapter of the fifth chapter and the fifteenth sutra of the eighteenth chapter, the above facts are explained as follows: arthath karmyogi keval indriya, man, buddhi or sharir dwaara bhi aasakti ko tyagkar antajkaran kii shuddhi ke liye karm karte hai
 These are the five reasons why a human works from the mind, speech and body or whatever is contrary to the scriptures
 is prakaar karmo kaa utpann karnaa evam sanchaalak man ke niyantran kii sadhana praan he or praanon ko niyantrit kar man par niyantran praapt karke kaa jo kaushal he vah hathyog he
 Hatha Yoga is "the means to attain physical and mental purification and balance"
 yoga vigyaan se sandarbhit aagam, nigam, upanishdon evam anya granthon ke anusaar hath shabd do mantron han or than ke sanyog se bana he
 Its meaning is derived from the relation of pranavahi nadis and pingala located in the human body
 ida evam pingala ke pravaah main man barhigati vaala hi rahata he
 Therefore, in order to infuse the mind, the soul has to be allowed to flow in the same meaning neither eda nor pingala, but the pulse between these two, which is called sushumna, the mind becomes calm and in self-control when it flows
 uparoktt sandarbh main hathyog kaa taatpary aise yoga se he jiske dwaara in do shaktiyon ke bich santulan kii sthapana ho sake
 Eda Nadi is a major pranic vessel of our body
 yah praan ke niskriy pahalu kaa pratik he jo manahshakti yaa chittashakti ke rup main abhivyakt or anubhoot hoti he
 Pingala is concerned with strength and activity, which is expressed and felt in the physical dimension as prana shakti
 is prakaar hathyog kaa sambandh sharir ke pranic pravaah se he
 The life is from the cultivation method of control
 is kaaran hathyog ko vedon main 'pranyog' bhi kaha gaya he
