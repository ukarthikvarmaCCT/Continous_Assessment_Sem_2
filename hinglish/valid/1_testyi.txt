 Within dentin, this erosion follows a triangular pattern, which is directed towards the tooth pulp
 ksharan ke is pattern kaa varnan vishisht rup se do tribhuj ke dwaara kiya jaataa he, jinke aadhaar diije par ek duusare se jude hote hai
 This base-to-base pattern is the typical pattern of erosion of a pit and crack, as opposed to erosion on a smooth surface
 chikani sataha par hone vaale ksharan ke teen prakaar hote hai
 Proximal caries, also known as interspersed caries, occur on the smooth surface between the proximal teeth
 mul ksharan daanton kii mul satahon par hota he
 The third type of erosion that occurs on a smooth surface occurs on any other smooth surface of the tooth
 samipsth ksharan kii pahchaan karnaa sarvaadhik kathin hota he
 Often this type of caries cannot be identified humanely by seeing or by a dental investigator
 Proximal caries form gravelly just below the point of contact of two teeth

 In Blake's classification system, proximal caries on posterior teeth are called category II caries
 agle daanton par hone vaale samipsth ksharan main yadi krintak chor shaamil na ho, to ise shrenee III main rakhaa jaataa he or yadi krintak chor shaamil ho, to ise shrenee IV main rakhte hai
 Original caries, sometimes described as a type of smooth-surfaced caries, are the third most common type of caries and usually occur when the original surfaces have been exposed to gingival subsidence
 
 If the gums are healthy, the development of root caries is unlikely because the bacterial plaque cannot reach the original surfaces
 The parent surfaces are more vulnerable to demineralization process than enamel because enamel begins to demineralize at ph 6
7, which is higher than enamel's delicate ph
 iske baavjood, dantabalk ksharan kii apeksha mul ksharan ke vikaas ko rokna adhik saral he kyonki dantabalk kii tulana main mul main fluoride kaa punauvasoshana adhik hota he
 Compared to intramuscular surfaces, substantive caries are more likely to occur on the lingual surfaces than on the gingival surfaces

 Injuries are also possible on the smooth surfaces of teeth

 Under Blake's classification, erosion on gums located near anatomical or gingival surfaces is marked as Category V
 shrenee VI pashchasth daanton ke siron or agrastha daanton ke krintak chhoron ke liye arakshit he
 In addition to the two categories described earlier, caries injury can also be described by their position on a specific surface of a tooth
 daant kii jo sataha gaalon yaa hothon se sabase nikat hoti he, un par hone vaale ksharan ko “ananmukh ksharan kaha jaataa he or jeebh kii ore sthit sataha par hone vaala ksharan, jiheey ksharan kehalaata he
 Erosive caries is further called cupola and bracket
 samrodhak ksharan pashchasth daanton kii chabane vaali satahon par paaya jaataa he
 Rodent caries is found on the chewing surfaces of the anterior teeth
 ksharanon kaa varnan “madhyam " athwa "duurastha " ke rup main bhi kiya ja saktaa he
 Moderate caries refers to a location on the teeth that is closest to the midline of the face, which is located on the vertical axis between the eyes down to the nose and the middle rodent's contact
 madhya rekha se dur sthit daanton kii sthiti kaa varnan duurastha ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 In some instances, the damage is also described in some other way, indicating its cause
 “shishu bottle ksharan”, “praarambhik shishav ksharan” athwa “shishu bottle daant ksharan” asthaayee daanton vaale chote bacchon main paaya jane vaala ek pattern he
 It is most likely to affect the teeth located on the anterior part of the jaw, but all teeth can be affected
 is prakaar ke ksharan ko yah naam is tathy ke aadhaar par mila he ki yah ksharan saamanytah shishuon ko unki bottle main rakhe mithe dravon ke saath sone kii anumati dene athwa shishuon din main kai baar mithe drav pilaane ke parinamswaroop hota he
 Another pattern of caries is "highly diffuse caries", which indicates advanced or excessive caries on multiple surfaces of multiple teeth
 atyadhik failanevaala ksharan munh sookhne kii beemaari se grast, munh ke swasthya kaa dhyaan na rakhane vaale, uttejk kaa prayog karne vaale tathaa / yaa chini kaa bahut adhik seven karne vaale vyaktiyon main dekha ja saktaa he
 If excessive diffuse erosion is due to preceding radiation on the head and neck, it can be described as radiation-affected erosion

 Dr
 Miller stated in 1887 that "dental caries is a chemical-parasitic process, which consists of two stages - enamel denervation, resulting in complete destruction, and enamel tissue as the primary stage, followed by The residual solution of the softened residue occurs
 " apni is pariklpana main, dow miller ne teen karkon ko aavashyak bhoomikaayen aavantit kin: To inform the progress rate and past history of caries, temporary details can be applied to them

 Paused caries describes an injury on a tooth that has previously been demineralized, but which has been re-privatized before a perforation has occurred
 fluoride upachaar kaa prayog karnaa punarkhatikaran main sahaayak ho saktaa he
 Depending on the tissue that is affected, it is possible to describe caries as enamel, dentin, or dentinal caries
 apane vikaas ke prarambh main, ksharan dwaara keval dantabalk ko prabhavit kiya janaa sambhav he
 Once the expansion of caries reaches the deep layer of dentin, the term "dentin caries" is used
 chunki cementem daanton kii jadon ko dhankane vaala sakht utak he, atah saamanytah yah kshay dwaara tab tak prabhavit nahin hota, jab tak ki daant kii jaden munh main ujagar na ho rahi hon
 haalanki, “dant-mul ksharan” shabdaawalee kaa prayog daanton kii jadon par hone vaale kshay kaa varnan karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he, lekin bahut hi durlabh sthitiyon main hi yah ksharan keval dant-mul ko prabhavit karata he
 The roots have a very thin layer of cementum on top of a large layer of dentin and thus most caries affecting dentin also affect dentin
 yah sambhav he ki ksharan kaa anubhav kar rahe vyakti ko isaki jaankaree na ho
 The earliest sign of a new carious lesion is in the form of a chapped white patches on the tooth surface, indicating that enamel is demineralized in that area
 ise praarambhik kshay kaha jaataa he
 When demineralization of the wound continues, it can turn brown, but eventually it will turn into a coat
 Before the hole is formed, this process is reversible, but once the hole is formed, the damaged tooth structure cannot be regenerated
 Any lesion that appears brown and shiny indicates that dental caries was present at some point, but the demineralization process has stalled and only one scar remains

 When enamel and dentin are destroyed, this perforation becomes symptomatic
 daant ke prabhavit kshetra apana rang badal dete hai or chune par mulaayam mahasoos hote hai
 Once the caries passes through enamel, the tooth ducts, which have a passage leading to the vein of the tooth, are exposed, causing pain in the teeth

 Due to tooth decay, problems like bad breath and distorted taste can also occur
 atyadhik viksit sthitiyon main, daant main hua sankraman aas-paas ke narm utakon tak bhi fail saktaa he
 Complications such as cavernous thrombosis and Ludbig's mumps can also pose a life threat

 Dental caries can occur on any surface of the tooth that is exposed to the pore of the mouth, but it cannot occur on the salvaged structure within the bone
 daanton ko prabhavit karne vaali kuch vishisht bimaariyaan va vikrutiyaan hai, jinke kaaran kisi vyakti main ksharan kaa khatra bad saktaa he
 Amelogenesis imperfecta, which occurs between 1 in 718 and one in 14,000 people, is a disease in which enamel is either not fully formed or is insufficiently formed and can fall out of the teeth
 donon hi sthitiyon main, daanton main kshay kaa khatra bad saktaa he kyonki dantabalk daant kii raksha kar paane main sakasham nahin hota
 In most individuals, the primary cause of dental caries is not teeth deformities or diseases
 Ninety-six percent of the tooth enamel is made up of minerals

 There is a higher risk of erosion in dentin and dentin than enamel because they contain less mineral content
 is prakaar, jab daant kii mul satahon kaa saamana masoodon main hone vaale gaddhon yaa masoodon se judi anya bimariyon se hota he, to ksharan jaldi viksit ho sakate hai
 However, even in a healthy oral environment, there is a risk of tooth decay
 daanton kii sanrachana ksharan ke nirmaan kii sambhaavna ko prabhavit kar sakati he
 Where the deep grooves of teeth are more numerous and exaggerated, there is a greater possibility of development of pits and cracks
 saath hi, yadi daanton ke bich ann-kan dabe hue hon, to ksharan kii sambhaavna bad jaati he
 Many types of oral bacteria are found in our mouths, but it is believed that only a few specific species of those bacteria are responsible for tooth decay, including Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli
 lactobacilas acedophilas, actinomices viscosas, nocardia esapeepi
 or stryptococas mutans kaa danta-kshay, visheshtah danta-mul main hone vaale kshay, ke saath nikat sambandh hota he
 Bacteria around the teeth and gums accumulate in a viscous, cream-like substance called plaque, which acts as a bio-covering
 kuch vishisht sthanon par plak kaa ekatra hona anya sthanon kii tulana main aam hota he
 Like the point of contact between teeth, the grooves found on the chewing surfaces of the molars and forearm teeth also provide microscopic occlusion
 masoodon par plak bhi ekatrit ho saktaa he
 Bacteria present in a person's mouth convert glucose, fructose, and most commonly sucrose into acids such as lactic acid, etc
 through a glycolytic process called fermentation
 yadi in amlon ko daant ke sampark main chhod diya jaae, to ve akhanijeekaran kaa kaaran ban sakate hai, jo ki khanijon ke vilyan kii prakriya he
 However this process is kinetic because remineralization can also occur if this acid is neutralized by saliva or mouthwash
 fluoride toothpaste athwa danta varnish punarkhanijeekaran main sahaayak ho sakate hai
 If demineralization continues for a long time, such a large amount of mineral-content may be lost that the remaining soft biomass decomposes, forming a coat or hole
 aisi sharkaraaon dwaara danta ksharan ke vikaas par daale jane vaale prabhaav ko ksharanakarita kehete hai
 Although sugars are a bound glucose and fructose unit, they are actually more corrosive than a mixture of equal amounts of glucose and fructose
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki jeevanu glucose va fructose kii up-ikaayiyon ke bich upasthit bandha se urja praapt karte hai
 S
 by converting sucrose into a highly viscous substance called dexran polysaccharide by enzyme dextransucranase
 Mutans stick to the bio-layer positioned on the tooth
 ksharan ke vikaas kii sambhaavna is baat se bhi prabhavit hoti he ki daant kis aavriti par ksharankari vaataavaranon ke sampark main aate hai
 After a meal or snack, bacteria present in the mouth metabolize sugars, resulting in the formation of an acidic by-product that lowers the ph
 samay ke saath-saath, laar kii pratirohak kshamta or daant kii sataha kii vighatit khanij samagri ke kaaran piech punah saamaanya sthiti par laut aata he
 During each contact with the acidic environment, some part of the non-organic material present on the surface of the teeth disintegrates and can remain decomposed for two hours

 If there is sufficient amount of appropriate carbohydrate in the food, then this erosion process can start within a few days of tooth eruption in the mouth
 pramaan is baat kii ore sanket karte hai ki fluoride upachaar is prakriya ko dhimaa kar dete hai
 Proximal caries take an average of four years to pass through the enamel of a permanent tooth

 Tobacco use is an important risk factor for teeth-related diseases that push the gums back
 jab masoode kaa daanton se judaav khatm ho jaataa he, to mul sataha munh main adhik darshneey ho jaati he
 If this happens, basic caries is a worrying factor because the dentin that covers the teeth is demineralized by acids more easily than enamel
 vartmaan main, dhumrapaan or shirobandh ksharan ke bich ek anaupchaarik sambandh kaa samarthan karne vaale paryaapt pramaan uplabdh nahin hai, lekin ye pramaan dhumrapaan or mul-sataha ksharan ke bich ek sambandh kii ore avashya sanket karte hai

 Enamel is a highly mineralized acellular tissue and is damaged by a chemical process initiated by caries bacteria
 jab ye jeevanu sharkara kaa seven karne lagate hai or iskaa prayog apni swayan kii urja ke liye karne lagate hai, tab ve lactic amla utpann karte hai
 The effects of this process include demineralization of the particles present in enamel, which is caused by the passage of time as well as acids and continues until bacteria physically penetrate the dentin
 Enamel rods, which are the basic units of enamel structure, are located perpendicularly from the tooth surface to the dentin
 chunki ksharan ke dwaara dantabalk kaa akhanijeekaran saamanytah dantabalk kii chad kii disha main hi hota he, atah dantabalk main gaddhon va chhidron ke bich bhinn-bhinn tribhujaakar pattern tathaa chikani-sataha vaale ksharan viksit hote hai ki daant ke do kshetron main dantabalk kii chhadon kii sthiti bhinn-bhinn hoti he
 When enamel loses its minerals and dental caries begins to develop, many clear areas develop in enamel, which can be seen with a light microscope
 dantabalk kii sabase gahari parat se dantabalk kii sataha tak, jin kshetron kii pahchaan kii gai he, ve hai: parbhasi kshetra, kaala kshetra, ghaav kaa mukhya-bhaag or sataha kshetra 
 The translucent zone is the first visible sign of erosion and occurs when one to two percent loss of minerals occurs
 kaale kshetra main dantabalk kaa thodaa-sa punarkhanijeekaran hota he, jo is baat kaa ek udhaaharan prastut karata he ki danta kshay kaa vikaas vaikalpik parivartanon ke saath kis prakaar ek sakriy prakriya he
 The area of most demineralization and destruction is the main part of the wound itself

 Unlike enamel, dentin responds to the progression of dental caries

 duusari ore, puure jivan-kaal ke dauraan odontoblast ke dwaara dant-utak utpaadit hota rahata he, jo goode or dant-utak ke bich sthit hota he
 Since odontoblasts are present, a catalyst, such as corrosion, can initiate a biological reaction
 in suraksha karypranaliyon main shwetapatli va tritiyak dant-utak kaa nirmaan shaamil hota he
 In dentin located from the deepest layer to enamel, the areas affected by corrosion are the area of translocation, area of destruction, and area of bacterial perforation
 parbhasi kshetra kshati kii prakriya kii aage badhati suchi kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or yah vahaan sthit hota he, jahaan praarambhik akhanijeekaran kii shuruyaat hoti he
 Areas of bacterial perforation and destruction are areas of invading bacteria and ultimately disintegration of dentin

 The diameter of dentinal tubules is more near the pulp and the lowest at the placenta of dentin and enamel
 kshati-prakriya puri dant-utak nalikaaon par jari rahati he, jo ki daant main gaharaai tak ksharan ke vikaas ke parinamswaroop utpann tribhujaakar pattern ke liye zimmedaar hoti hai
 The ducts also allow caries to develop rapidly
 isaki pratikriyaswaroop, nalikaaon ke bheetar upasthit drav is jeevanvik sankraman se ladane ke liye hamaare pratirohak tantra se immunoglobulin laata he
 At the same time, the mineralization of nearby tubes also increases
 iskaa parinaam nalikaaon ke nirmaan ke rup main miltaa he, jo ki jeevanvik pragati kii gati ko kam karne kaa ek prayaas he
 Additionally, when bacterial acids demineralize the hydroxyapatite particles, calcium and phosphorus are released, allowing a greater number of particles to penetrate deeper into the dentinal tubules
 ye kan ek avrodh kaa nirmaan karte hai or ksharan ke vistaar ko dhimaa karte hai
 Following these protective responses, dentin is considered to be whitish
 aisa mana jaataa he dant-utak kii nalikaaon ke bheetar upasthit dravon ke kaaran daant ke goode ke bheetar sthit dard abhigrahi sakriy ho jate hai
 Since the white dentin blocks the flow of such fluids, it is possible that the pain that would have warned of the invasion of bacteria may not have occurred before
 iske parinamswaroop, daant kii kisi bhi samvedansheeltaa ke bina danta ksharan ek lambey samay tak pragati karata rah saktaa he, jisase daant kii sanrachana kii bahut adhik haani ho sakati he
 In response to dental caries, more dentin may be produced in the pulp direction
 is nae dant-utak kaa ullekh tritiyak dant-utak ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 Tertiary dentin is produced to protect the pulp from the advancing bacteria as much as possible
 jab adhik tritiyak dant-utak utpann ho jaataa he, to goode kaa aakaar ghat jaataa he
 This type of dentin is subclassified according to the presence or absence of the original odontoblast
 yadi odontoblast itane adhik samay tak batch jate hai ki ve danta kshay ke prati pratikriya de saken, to is sthiti main utpann dant-utak ko “pratikriyaatmak " dant-utak kehete hai
 If odontoblasts are destroyed, the dentin produced in this condition is called "rectal" dentin
 sudhaarak dant-utak kii sthiti main, nasht ho chuke odontoblast kii bhoomika nibhaane ke liye anya utakon kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 It is believed that growth factors, especially tgf-beta, initiate the formation of rectal dentin by pulmonary fibroblasts and mesenchymal tissues
 sudhaarak dant-utak ausatan 1
5 μm / pratidin kii dar par viksit kiya jaataa he, lekin ise 3
5 μm / pratidin tak badhaayaa ja saktaa he
 The resulting dentin consists of irregularly shaped dentinal tubules and may not line up with pre-existing dentinal tubules
 This reduces the ability of dental caries to progress within the dentin tubules

 Dental radiographs may show dental caries, especially caries between the teeth, before being visible in any other way
 bade danta ksharan aksar nangi ankhon se dekhe ja sakate hai, lekin chote ghaavon ko pahchaan paanaa kathin ho saktaa he
 Dentists use radiographic as well as visual and tactile inspection to detect erosion of pits and holes

 Some dental researchers have warned against using dental investigators to find caries

 Since the process of damage can be returned by stopping the formation of the hole, it may be possible to prevent corrosion with fluoride and to reprogram the tooth surface
 jab ek chhidr upasthit ho, to daant kii kho chuki sanrachana ko badalane ke liye punarsthapana kii aavashyaktaa hogi
 At times, erosion of pits and holes can be difficult to identify
 dant-utak tak pahunchane ke liye jeevanu dantabalk kaa bhedan kar sakate hai, lekin tab bahari sataha ko punarkhanijeekrut kiya ja saktaa he, visheshtah yadi fluoride upasthit ho
 These caries, sometimes called "hidden caries", can still be seen by X-ray radiographs, but visual examination of the tooth will show that enamel is intact or minimally perforated
 daant kii nasht ho chuki sanrachana puri tarah punarnirmit nahin hoti, haalanki yadi swatchta ko iske ishtatam str par rakhaa jaae, to bahut chote kshatigrast ghaavon kaa punarkhanijeekaran sambhav ho saktaa he
 For small wounds, occasional fluoride is sometimes used to encourage remineralization

 Insomniac — local, nitrous oxide "), or other recommended drugs — may be required during or after treatment to reduce pain or to relieve discomfort during treatment
 kshatigrast padaarth ke bade bhaagon ko daant se nikaalane ke liye ek danta handpis kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 a spoon is a dental device that is carefully used to remove caries, and is sometimes used when caries in the dentin reaches near the pulp
 Once the caries is removed, the lost tooth structure needs some kind of dental restoration, to bring the tooth back to its functional and elegant condition
 punarsthapanaatmak padaarthon main danta sammishran, mishrit raal, chini-mitti or swarna shaamil hai
 Mixed resin and ceramic can be made in such a way that they look similar to the natural color of the patient's teeth and are often used when beauty is a concern
 mishrit punarsthapana danta sammishran athwa swarna jitani majboot nahin hoti; kuch danta chikitsak swarna ko pichley daanton, jinamein chabane kaa bal bahut adhik hota he, ke liye ekmaatr sanstuti-yogya punarsthapana maanate hai
 When caries is very widespread, it is possible that the structure of the tooth does not have enough space to contain the restorative material within the tooth
 atah ek sheersh kii aavashyaktaa ho sakati he
 This restoration appears like a cap and is folded over the remaining top of the tooth
 sheersh aksar swarna, chini-mitti yaa dhaatu main judi chini-mitti se bane hote hai
 In some specific conditions, endodontic treatment may be necessary to restore the tooth
 andodontic upachaar, jise “root kanal " bhi kaha jaataa he, ki anushansa tab kii jaati he, yadi daant main upasthit guda kshati-kaarak jeevanuon ke kaaran yaa chot ke kaaran nasht ho jaae
 root kanal ke dauraan, daant ke kshatigrast bhaag ke saath hi daant ke goode, nason va sanvahani utakon sahit, ko hataa diya jaataa he
 The ducts are cleaned and shaped by tools of endodontic files, then normally filled with rubber-like material, called gutta form
 daant ko bharaa jaataa he or isamen ek sheersh bhi joda ja saktaa he
 The tooth is now dead without the root canal being complete because it is devoid of any living tissue
 uchhedan bhi daanton ke ksharan kaa ek upachaar ho saktaa he
 The decision to remove a damaged tooth is made if the tooth has been damaged so much due to the degenerative process that it cannot be effectively restored
 kabhi-kabhi uchhedan par vichaar tab kiya jaataa he, yadi daant ke liye koi virdohi daant uplabdh na ho athwa jab isse bhavishya main aage koi samasya utpann ho sakati ho, jaisaa ki pragna-danta ke maamle main ho saktaa he
 Ablation may also be preferred in situations where the patient does not want to bear the expense or discomfort involved in tooth restoration
 vyaktigat swatchta dekhbhaal main pratidin thik se daant saaf karnaa or mulaayam dhaage se safai karnaa shaamil hai
 The purpose of oral hygiene is to reduce the presence of any genetic representative of the disease in the mouth

 This layer prevents food from getting trapped in pits and crevices within the grooves due to the pressure generated when chewing, so that the bacteria residing there are deprived of the carbohydrates they convert to acid demineralization and thus It prevents the formation of caries in pits and crevices, which are the most common form of dental caries
 bacchon ke daanton par seelint ko saamanytah charvnak daanton ke ugane ke kuch hi samay baad lagaaya jaataa he
 Older people can also benefit from dental sealants, but their dental history and the possibility of caries formation are generally considered

 mukhya shaharon se duuri Apart from the airports at Chandigarh and Amritsar which are far away from each other, the nearest to the reservoir is Pathankot and Gaggal Airport
 maharana pratap jhil se bharmaar kii duuri 12 km he
 The reservoir is bounded by the rugged Dhauladhar mountain range, the lowest foothills of the Himalayas on the northern side of the indus-gangetic plain areas, and through the cutting of the valleys of mountain rivers
 beas nadi, jis par pong baandh sthit he, sindhu nadi kii paanch pramukh nadiyon main se ek he
 The river flows from Beas Kund near the Rohtang Pass, in the upper Himalayas, and generally in the north-south direction to Largi, where it turns sharply at right angles and flows in a western direction above the Pong Dam

 Water from the reservoir is sent through the lock pipe to the power house, each of 5
025 m diameter
 Reservoir operation is a crucial aspect since both Bhakra Dam and Pong Dam Projects necessitate their operation in an 'integrated mann3er' to achieve optimal benefits of irrigation and power
 Water stored in the reservoir during the summer and rainy season, after meeting with the irrigation requirements of the partner states, is released in a regulated manner during lean periods, in a fixed schedule of Filling period–depletion Period for both the reservoirs
 The filling and depletion period for a technical committee of the Bhakra Beas Management Board authorizes the monthly releases appropriately honoring the requirements projected by the partner states
 The operation manuals titled "designer's Criteria for the Operation, Maintenance and Observation" for the Bhakra, Pong & Pando reservoirs, duly updated as required, provide the guiding rules for the efficient integrated operation of the reservoirs
the two reservoirs supply irrigation and drinking water to Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi and Chandigarh
 Himachal Pradesh is also provided with drinking water supply
 jalashay ke liye darj kii gai pani kii gunvattta ke maanakon hai: Pong Dam Lake was declared a Ramsar wetland site on account of its rich waterfowl diversity for conservation and sustainable use of the wetland
 This recognition was based on a proposal formulated by the Himachal State Council for Science, Technology and Environment, Shimla submitted to the Ramsar Bureau, Switzerland through the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India
 The large reservoir and its strategic location in the extreme north-west of the northern plains has attracted migratory birds from the plains of India and Central Asian countries and Siberia
 More than 220 bird species of 54 families have been recorded
 The two-day waterfowl census, which ended on 1st Feb 2015, recorded over 130,000 birds in the Pong Dam Wetlands
 The interception of the migratory birds on their trans-himalayan fly path, during each migration season, has enriched the biodiversity values of the reservoir
 The Pong reservoir and its catchment have the following rich flora and fauna
 The reservoir peripheral land area has mixed perennial and deciduous pine forests on hills
 Eucalyptus trees have also been grown in the area
 The forest growth provides enough sustenance to the migratory birds
 The tree species of the forest area are acacia, jamun, shisham, mango, mulberry, ficus, kachanar, amla and prunus
 a variety of shrubs, grasses and climbers have also been reported
the reservoir seasonal water-level variation between the maximum water level and the minimum draw-down level does not permit growth of much emergent vegetation, but some amount of submerged vegetation has been noticed 
 a wide variety of commercially viable fish, 27 species of 5 families, such as mahseer, catla, mirror carp, singhara and others are recorded in the Pong Dam reservoir and its tributaries
 Before the reservoir was built, catfishes, mirror carps and a few coarse fish were the dominant fish fauna in the Beas River
 With the emergence of the reservoir, commercial fishing was encouraged as an important programme not only to provide employment to about 1500 fishermen but also to promote the eco-tourism potential
 a planned operation of fish stocking was launched with first introduction of common carp in 1974 and Indian major carps or silver carp in 1976–77
 This resulted in a shift in the catch structure of the reservoir, with carps accounting for 61
8% of the total landings in 1987–88
 The present fish stocks in the reservoir, in the sequence of their abundance are: 1) rohu, Aorichthys seenghala, 2) Labeo calbasu, 3) Tor putitora, 4) Cirrhinus mrigala, 5) Wallago attu, 6) Cyprinus carpio, 7) Labeo dero, 8) Catla catla and 9) Channa sp
the reservoir, unlike other reservoirs in the region, has shown a marked growth in catch of mahseer fish, recording 20% of the total catch during 1999–2000 with the average size of the fish ranges from 1
5–1
7 kg
 This is attributed to the change in the Himachal Pradesh Fishing Rules, with an added clause which specifies the minimum catchable size for mahseer as 300–500 mm or approximately 1
2 kg
 That rule is stated to give to each female mahseer to breed at least once before being caught
 Mahseer angling in the Pong Dam reservoir is said to be the only one of its kind in the country
 The reservoir was declared as a bird sanctuary in 1983
 a 5-kilometer belt from the periphery of the lake has been declared as buffer zone for the management of the bird sanctuary
 The national, as well as international, significance of the sanctuary is enhanced because of its waterfowl diversity, which was evidenced by the increase of water fowl species from 39 prior to the reservoir to 54 species at post-reservoir stage
 The number of birds reported, particularly during the winter period of November to March, has steadily increased over the years
 The recent records recorded a water fowl count of 130,000 in 2004 and 142,000 during 2005 migratory birds - a major increase from the average annual count of 18,887 for the period 1988–1995
 The main bird species reported are the barheaded geese, Anser indicus, northern lapwing, ruddy shelduck, The avian habitats in the reservoir area are categorized under the following heads: Around five thousand tourists visit the bird sanctuary during the winter season, and most of them come to watch migratory birds for the first time
 Efforts are being made to encourage eco-tourism to attract more tourists to the reservoir
 The periphery above the water surface area of the reservoir has recorded fauna species such as barking deer, sambar, wild boars, leopards and oriental small-clawed otters
 Bathu Temple: - 7 km from Jawali, a tehsil of Kangra District, there stands a cluster of antique, unique, tall temples which remain dipped in water for eight months: but stand exposed to the human eye only during March to June
 a regional water-sports centre has been established in the Pong Dam Reservoir, which offers focused activities such as canoeing, rowing, sailing, and water skiing, apart from swimming
 Training programmes are organized in water safety and rescue measures with three-tier water-sports courses: the basic course, intermediate course, and advanced course
 Modern infrastructure facilities have been created with a 75-bed hostel and a 10-suite rest house
 It is said to be the only centre of its type in the country
 To know more about the institute please visit the website of the institute: ABVIMAS website link The following protection measures have enabled preservation of the reservoir ecosystem

 According to Kautilya, the messenger is incapable of being a chandala
 mahabharat ke shaantiparv main bhishma nen yudhisthir ko bataaya ki doot ko maarane vaala narak gami or bhrun hatya ke paap kaa bhaagi hota he
 Nowadays it has been established by international law and court decisions that it is illegal to imprison an ambassador and confiscate his goods
 yahaan tak ki shatrarajya ke doot ko haani pahunchaana bhi uchit nahin he
 If any embassy is harmed in excitement, the concerned state should be compensated for it

 Embassies in other states do not have the privilege to shelter political criminals in their buildings
 yadi rajdoot aisa kare to sthaneey sarkaar shakti kaa prayog karke apradhi ko pakad sakati he

 The most outstanding right to diplomatic privilege is immunity from taxes
 preshit rajya ke adhyaksh ke pratinidhi hone ke aadhaar par rajanyik sabhi prakaar ke karon se mukt hota he
 Thayer opines that "the most cherished of diplomatic rights is freedom from taxes
" “ isi prakaar haul kaa bhi mat he ki ”rajanyik abhikrtta swayan, uski vyaktigat vasteen tathaa vah sampatti jo uske prabhu ke pratinidhi ke rup main uski he, kar mukt he
 “diplomats have been given immunity from taxes by section 18 of the pan-american Convention of 1928
 is dhara ke anusaar, rajanyik adhikarigan us rajya main jahaan se pratyaapit he, karon se mukt honge- Normally diplomatic customs tax, motor tax, income tax, local tax, radio duty etc
 are immunized
 kuch deshon main rajanyikon ko nagarpalika sambandhi kar-safai, roshi, pani aadi-avashya dene padate hai
 Thus diplomats are exempt from national, provincial, regional or local taxes and customs taxes
 seemaa karon ke sambandh main watal kaa mat he ki rajdoot ko isse kaai chhot nahi honi chaiye kyonki is kar kaa uske kaary bhaar se koi sambandh nahin he, parantu watel is mat se sahamat hai ki rajdoot ko sabhi prakaar ke karon se nishchit hi swatantra hona chaiye
 An exception related to border taxes is that if the border officer realizes that there is any irregularity in the goods imported by the ambassador, they can remove diplomatic rights and immunities and inspect the same as the ambassador, in 1905 the United States ambassador The goods of Henry White were inspected by the Austrian border authorities

 Church or temple hours cannot be played at such places
 dharmik sthaan baahar se aisa nahin dikhe ki vah puja grih he tathaa puja kii bhashaa sweekaari desh kii hi ho
 In 1846, when the language of the house of worship was not Italian, the Pope instructed that the language of worship should be changed

 According to the opinion of some authors, ambassadors should not be given immunity for business work
 yadi rajdoot ke paas uske karyaalay or nivas ke atirikt koi vaastavik sampatti he to is par kar lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Private business can be prosecuted by an ambassador
 anek vichaarak is mat kaa samarthan karte hai
 But the problem is how to differentiate between the personal wealth of the ambassador and the property with immunity
 rajdoot ko jo visheshadhikaar saunpe jate hai ve ek seemaa tak uske anuchar varg ko bhi praapt hote hai
 These include employees working in the embassy, personal servants of the envoy, his family-people and servants

 As a result, the term X-ray is used to refer to a radiographic photograph produced by the use of this method in addition to the method itself

 X-rays are a type of ionizing radiation and exposure to them can be harmful to health
 haal ke dashakon main eks-re or gamma kirnon ke bich ke vibhed main badlaav aayaa he
 Originally, the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation emitted from X-ray tubes was longer than the wavelength of radiation emitted from radioactive nuclei

 However, groups of wavelengths overlapped extensively as continuous spectrum "x-ray" sources with relatively short wavelengths, such as linear accelerators and "gamma ray" emitters with relatively long wavelengths, were discovered

 The measurement of the ionizing potential of an X-ray is called the unveiling: haalanki padaarth par insheel vikiran kaa prabhaav utpann aavesh kii apeksha unamem jamaa urja kii maatra se bahut kareeb se sambandhit hota he
 The measure of this absorbed energy is called the absorbed quantity: samatuly maatra, maanav utak par vikiran ke jaivik prabhaav kii maap he
 As for X-rays, it is equal to the absorbed volume
 medical eks-re, maanav nirmit vikiran anaavaran kaa ek mahatvapurn strot he, jinka pariman 1987 main sanyukt rajya america main 58% tha, lekin chunki adhikansh vikiran anaavaran, prakritik hote hai, isliye medical eks-re kaa pariman, kul america vikiran anaavaran kaa keval 10 pratishat hota he

 X-rays are generated from the X-ray tube, which is a vacuum tube using a high voltage to increase the speed of free electrons by a hot cathode to a high velocity
 ucch veg vaale electron, anode naamak ek dhatvik lakshya se takaraate hai, jisase eks-re kaa nirmaan hota he
 In medical X-ray tubes, the target is usually tungsten or a highly resistant alloy of rhenium and tungsten, but sometimes molybdenum for more specialized applications, such as in mammography when soft X-rays are needed

 The maximum energy of a photon of the generated X-ray is limited by the energy of the electrons that are equal to the voltage of the tube, so a tube of 80 kv cannot produce an X-ray with more energy than 80 kg electro volts
 jab electron, lakshya par prahaar karte hai, tab do alag-alag parmanvik prakriyaaon dwaara eks-re kaa nirmaan hota he: Therefore the resulting product of a tube consists of a continuous bremsstrolung spectrum falling to zero at the voltage of the tube and also several spikes along characteristic lines

 In medical clinical applications, low-energy X-rays are unwanted because the body absorbs them completely, necessitating increased volume

 Because on 11 March 2018 and 18 March 2018, i conducted a survey by "rahul Srivastava" and some of my colleagues whether Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan works in Hindustan or just in paper, we found that in the name of education There is corruption spread in the country, better education for the children of the rich and illiteracy for the children of the poor, basic education officer and their team any kind of survey Why do the children not be able to go to school, what could be the reason, just sitting in their office, they break the chairs, children begging on the road, child laborers do not go to school at all because their parents He does not even know about such a campaign because he himself is illiterate but who will tell him about all this? It is the duty of the officials of basic education that the homes of every poor, saura ghadi kaa prayog surya kii disha se samay kaa gyaan karne ke liye kiya jaataa tha
 The style and capability of these clocks was limited to the time of day as it could not function at night
 iske phir bhi vishwa main samay jaanane hetu sabase pehle inkaa prayog kiya gaya tha
 These clocks were invented to form the basis of other time-telling clocks
 bharat main pracheen vaidic kaal se saura ghadiyon kaa prayog hota rahaa he
 The pure methods of time measurement by the solar clock in Surya Siddhanta are described in Chapters 3 and 13
 aarambhik saura ghadiyaan subah or dopaher main hi kaam karti thim
 The construction method of these clocks consisted of tying a large pillar to one end and burying it in the ground and estimating the time from the shadow of the column lying on the ground along with the sun's rotation
 madhyanh ke samay stambh kii chaaya sabase choti hoti thi jisase pataa chalata tha ki surya thik akaash ke bich main sthit he
 Such clocks were used a lot in Western Asia and Egyptian civilizations
 iske baad avishkaarkartaaon ne or kai prakaar kii ghadiyon kaa nirmaan kiya jisase din ke samay ko kai praharon main baanta ja saktaa tha, haalanki, vah prahar aaj ke ghanton se kuch lambey hote the
 According to the seasons in many civilizations, solar clocks began to tell time, and in many places they also used to give knowledge of rare days like equal lengths of day and night
 kai samskritiyon main maanviya saura ghadiyaan bhi baniin jisamen ek vyakti ek nishchit sthaan par khadaa hota tha or apni parchhaayi ke badalte aakaar se samay kaa pataa lagaataa tha
 For the correct functioning of solar clocks, it was necessary that they be installed at the right places
 vishwa ke alag-alag sthanon par ek hi samay par surya bhinn dishaao main hota tha, isliye surya kii disha ke anusaar ghadiyon ko sthapit karnaa hota tha
 One way to do this is to set up the solar clock in such a way that the shadows look straight when the sun is in the middle of the sky

 In the freedom struggle of India, many people took inspiration from the life of Shivaji and sacrificed their body, mind and money for the independence of India
 aaj unki rajaniti ki tarj par nepal va bharat main shivasena naam kaa rajnatik paksh chalaa aa rahaa he
 Shivaji Maharaj was born on 19 February 1630 in the Shivneri fort
 shahji bhonsle kii patni jijabai kii kokh se shivaji maharaj kaa janm 19 farvari 1630 ko shivneri durg main hua tha
 The fort of Shivneri was near Junnar Nagar, north of Poona

 He was adept in all the arts, having studied politics and war in his childhood
 ye bhonsle upjati ke the jo ki multah kshatriya maratha jati ke the
 According to Gagabhatta, Shivaji's dynasty comes from the famous Guhil Sisodia dynasty of Mewar

 His father was a great knight and his second wife was Tukabai Mohite
 unki mata ji jijabai jadhav kul main utpann asaadhaaran pratibhashali thi or unke pita ek shaktishaalee samant the
 Parents had a great influence on Shivaji Maharaj's character

 They would fret over the misdeeds of the ruling class and become restless

 us samay bijapur kaa rajya aapasi sangharsh tathaa videshi akramanakal ke daur se guzar rahaa tha
 Instead of serving the Sultan of such an empire, he started organizing the Mavalas against Bijapur
 mawal pradesh pashchim ghat se judaa he or koi 150 kilometre lambaa or 30 kilometre chaudaa he
 They are considered to be skilled warriors because of leading a struggling life
 is pradesh main maratha or sabhi jati ke log rahete hai
 Shivaji Maharaj took people from all these castes and named them Mavals and organized everyone and became familiar with their state by contacting them
 mawal yuvakon ko laakar unhone durg nirmaan kaa kaary armbh kar diya tha
 The support of the Mavals proved to be as important for Shivaji Maharaj as the latter with the Afghans for Sher Shah Suri
 us samay bijapur aapasi sangharsh tathaa mughalon ke akraman se pareshaan tha
 Sultan of Bijapur, Adilshah, removed his army from many fortifications and handed them over to the local rulers or feudatories
 jab adilshaah biimaar padaa to bijapur main araajaktaa fail gai or shivaji maharaj ne avasar kaa laabh uthaakar bijapur main pravesh kaa nirnay liya
 Shivaji Maharaj adopted the policy of taking control of the fortifications of Bijapur in its later days
 sabase pehla durg tha torana kaa durg
 The fort of Toran was 30 kilometers southwest of Poona
 shivaji ne sultan adilshaah ke paas apana doot bhejkar khabar bhijwai kii ve pehle kiledaar kii tulana main behatar rakam dene ko taiyaar hai or yah kshetra unhen saunp diya jaye
 He had already bribed the court of Adilshah in his favor and according to the advice of his courtiers, Adilshah made Shivaji Maharaj the suzerain of that fort
 us durg main mili sampatti se shivaji maharaj ne durg kii surakshatmak kamiyon kii marammat kaa kaam karavaaya
 Some 10 kilometers away from this was the fort of Rajgarh and Shivaji Maharaj took control of this fort too
 shivaji maharaj kii is samrajya vistaar kii niti kii bhanak jab adilshaah ko mili to vah kshubdh hua
 He asked Shahji Raje to keep his son under control
 shivaji maharaj ne apane pita kii parvaah kiye bina apane pita ke kshetra kaa prabandh apane haathon main le liya or niyamit lagaan band kar diya
 After Rajgarh, he took the fort of Chakan and then the fort of Kondana
 kondana par adhikaar karte samay unhen ghoose deni padi
 After that, Aurangzeb sent Mirzaraja Jai singh and captured 23 forts
 Later Mavala Tanaji Malusare of Shivaji Maharaj captured the Kondhana fort but in that war he received the Virgati, after remembering the right of Kondana in his memory, he was named Sinhagad
 
 shahji raaje ko puna or soopa kii jagiradaari di gai thi or soopa kaa durg unke sambandhi baaji mohite ke haath main thi
 Shivaji Maharaj invaded the fort of Supa at night and took control of the fort and sent Baji Mohite to Shahaji Raje in Karnataka
 uski sena kaa kuch bhaag bhi shivaji maharaj kii seva main aa gaya
 At the same time, the fortress of Purandar died and a fight broke out between his three sons for the succession of the fort
 do bhaaiyon ke nimantran par shivaji maharaj purandar pahunche or kootneeti kaa sahaara lete hue unhone sabhi bhaaiyon ko bandi bana liya
 In this way, his authority was also established on the fort of Purandar
 ab tak kii ghatana main shivaji maharaj ko koi yuddh yaa khunkhraba nahin karnaa padaa tha
 By 1647 AD, he had also become the ruler of the territory from Chakan to Neera
 apni badi sainik shakti ke saath shivaji maharaj ne maidani ilaakon main pravesh karne kii yojana banaai
 Shivaji Maharaj sent an army against the Konkan under the leadership of Abaji Sonder by forming an cavalry army
 aabaaji ne konkan sahit nau anya durgon par adhikaar kar liya
 Apart from this, the fortifications of Tala, Mosmala and Raiti also came under Shivaji Maharaj
 lut kii sari sampatti raigarh main surakshit rakhi gai
 After liberating the governor of Kalyan, Shivaji Maharaj turned to Colaba and incited the chiefs to wage war against foreigners
 bijapur kaa sultan shivaji maharaj kii harkaton se pehle hi aakrosh main tha
 He ordered Shivaji Maharaj's father to be arrested
 shahji raaje us samay karnataka main the or ek vishwasghaatee sahaayak baaji ghorpade dwaara bandi banaakar bijapur laae gaye
 He was also accused that he tried to obtain the service of Qutb Shah who was the ruler of Golconda and hence the enemy of Adilshah
 bijapur ke do saradaaron kii madhyasthata ke baad shahaji maharaj ko is shart par mukt kiya gaya ki ve shivaji maharaj par lagaam kasenge
 For the next four years, Shivaji Maharaj did not launch an attack against Bijipur
 is dauraan unhone apni sena sangathit kii
 Shivaji Rajane did not invade the areas of Bijapur according to the conditions of Salvation of Shahaji, but he tried to increase his power in the south-west
 par is kram main jaavali kaa rajya baadha kaa kaam kar rahaa tha
 The state was located in the far northwest of Satara, between the river Vama and Krishna
 yahan kaa raja chandrarav more tha jisane ye jaagir shivaji se praapt kii thi
 Shivaji asked the More ruler Chandra Rao to join Swaraj but Chandrarao joined with the Sultan of Bijapur
 san 1656 main shivaji ne apni sena lekar jaavali par akraman kar diya
 Chandrarao More and his two sons fought with Shivaji but in the end they were imprisoned but Chandrarao fled
 sthaneey logon ne shivaji ke is krity kaa virodh kiya par ve vidroh ko kuchalane main safal rahe
 With this, Shivaji got the property of eight dynasties stored in that fort
 iske alaava kai mawal sainik murarabaji deshpandey bhi shivaji kii sena main sammilit ho gaye
 Shivaji had both Bijapur and Mughal enemies
 us samay shahzada aurangzeb dakkan kaa soobedaar tha
 At the same time, Sultan Adilshah of Bijapur died on 1 November 1656, after which an atmosphere of chaos arose in Bijapur
 is sthiti kaa laabh uthaakar aurangzeb ne bijapur par akraman kar diya or shivaji ne aurangzeb kaa saath dene kii bajaay usapar dhaava bol diya
 His army attacked Junnar city and looted 200 horses with a lot of wealth
 ahmednagar se 700 ghode, chaar hathi ke alaava unhone gunda tathaa racin ke durg par bhi lutpaat machaai
 As a result, Aurangzeb was upset with Shivaji and the friendship negotiations ended
 shahjahan ke aadesh par aurangzeb ne bijapur ke saath sandhi kar lee or isi samay shahjahan biimaar pad gaya
 Aurangzeb migrated to North India as soon as he was afflicted and became the Shah of the Mughal Empire after imprisoning Shah Jahan there
 dakshin bharat main aurangzeb kii anupasthiti or bijapur kii dawandol raajnneetik sthit ko jaanakar shivaji ne samarji ko zanjeera par akraman karne ko kaha
 But his battle with the Siddis of Janjira lasted for several days
 iske baad shivaji ne khud zanjeera par akraman kiya or dakshin konkan par adhikaar kar liya or daman ke portugaliyon se vaarshik kar ekatra kiya
 After taking over Kalyan and Bhiwandi, they established a naval base there
 is samay tak shivaji 40 durgon ke maalik ban chuke the
 After Aurangzeb returned to Agra, the Sultan of Bijapur also breathed a sigh of relief
 ab shivaji hi bijapur ke sabase prabal shatru rah gaye the
 Shahaji was already asked to keep his son under control but Shahaji showed his inability to do so
 shivaji se nipatane ke liye bijapur ke sultan ne abdullah bhatari ko shivaji ke viruddh bheja
 Afzal traveled in 1659 with 120,000 soldiers
 tulajapur ke mandiron ko nasht karata hua vah satara ke 30 kilometre uttar vaai, shirval ke najadik tak aa gaya
 But Shivaji stayed on the fort of Pratapgarh
 afjal khan ne apane doot krishnaji bhaskar ko sandhi-vaarta ke liye bheja
 He sent a message through him that if Shivaji accepts the subjugation of Bijapur, the Sultan will give him the right to all the areas which are under Shivaji's control
 saath hi shivaji ko bijapur ke darbar main ek sammanit pad praapt hoga
 Though Shivaji's minister and advisor was in favor of As Sandhi, Shivaji did not like these talks
 unhone krishnaji bhaskar ko uchit sammaan dekar apane darbar main rakh liya or apane doot gopinath ko vastusthiti kaa jayja lene afjal khan ke paas bheja
 From Gopinath and Krishnaji Bhaskar, Shivaji felt that Afzal Khan wanted to imprison Shivaji by plotting a treaty
 atah unhone yuddh ke badale afjal khan ko ek bahumoolya uphaar bheja or is tarah afjal khan ko sandhi vaarta ke liye raji kiya
 Both of them had ambushed their soldiers at the place of peace, when the two met at the place of meeting, Afzal Khan attacked Shivaji with his Katiyar, in defense, Shivaji killed Afzal Khan with his clothes
 afjal khan kii mrityu ke baad shivaji ne panhala ke durg par adhikaar kar liya
 After this, along with taking control of the fortifications of Pawangarh and Vasantgarh, he also failed the attack of Rustom Khan
 isse rajapur tathaa daawul par bhi unka kabja ho gaya
 Now an atmosphere of terror had arisen in Bijapur and the feudals there, forgetting mutual differences, decided to attack Shivaji
 2 oktober 1665 ko bijapuri sena ne panhala durg par adhikaar kar liya
 Shivaji was in trouble, but taking advantage of the darkness of the night, he managed to escape
 bijapur ke sultan ne swayan kaman samhaalkar panhala, pavangadh par apana adhikaar waapas le liya, rajapur ko lut liya or shringargarh ke pradhan ko maar daalaa
 At the same time, due to the revolt of Siddijauhar in Karnataka, the Sultan of Bijapur entered into an agreement with Shivaji
 is sandhi main shivaji ke pita shahji ne madhyasthata kaa kaam kiya
 According to this treaty in 1662, Shivaji was recognized as an independent ruler by the Sultan of Bijapur
 isi sandhi ke anusaar uttar main kalyaan se lekar dakshin main ponda tak kaa or purv main indapur se lekar pashchim main daawul tak kaa bhubhag shivaji ke niyantran main aa gaya
 Shivaji's army had by this time 30,000 infantry and 1000 cavalry
 uttar bharat main badshaah banane kii hode khatm hone ke baad aurangzeb kaa dhyaan dakshin kii taraf gaya
 He was aware of Shivaji's growing sovereignty and appointed his maternal uncle Shaista Khan as the Subedar of the South for the purpose of keeping control over Shivaji
 shyska khan apane 1,50,000 phoj lekar soupan or chaakan ke durg par adhikaar kar puna pahunch gaya
 He looted in Maval for 3 years
 ek raat shivaji ne apane 350 mavalo ke saath unpar hamalaa kar diya
 Shaista managed to escape through the window but had to wash her hands with her four fingers in this sequence
 shysta khan ke putr, tathaa chalis rakshakon or anginat sainikon kaa katl kar diya gaya
 After this incident Aurangzeb made Shaista the Subedar of Bengal instead of Deccan and Shahzada Muazzam was sent to replace Shaista
 is jeet se shivaji kii pratishtha main vruddhi hui
 Six years later, Shaista Khan destroyed King Shivaji's entire Mulukh with his 15 xxrep 4 0 army
 is liye us kaa harjaana vasuul karne ke liye shivaji ne mughal kshetron main lutpaat machaana armbh kiya
 Surat was then a stronghold of Western merchants and a gateway for Hindustani Muslims to perform Haj
 yah ek samrudh nagar tha or iskaa bandargah bahut mahatvapurn tha
 Shivaji looted the wealthy merchants of Surat for six days in 1664 with an army of four thousand
 aam aadmi ko unhonen nahin lutaa or phir laut gaye
 The Dutch and the British have mentioned this incident in their articles
 us samay tak europea vyapaariyon ne bharat tathaa anya asian deshon main bas gayi the
 Until Nadir Shah invaded India, no European power thought of attacking the Indian Mughal Empire
 surat main shivaji kii lut se khinn hokar aurangzeb ne inayat khan ke sthaan par gayasuddin khan ko surat kaa faujadaar niyukt kiya
 And Shahzada Muazzam and Deputy General Raja Jaswant Singh were replaced by Diler Khan and Raja Jaisingh
 raja jaisingh ne bijapur ke sultan, europea shaktiyaan tathaa chote samanton kaa sahyog lekar shivaji par akraman kar diya
 In this war, Shivaji started to suffer loss and seeing the possibility of defeat, Shivaji sent a proposal for a treaty
 june 1665 main hui is sandhi ke mutabik shivaji 23 durg mughalon ko de denge or is tarah unke paas keval 12 durg batch jaayenge
 The income from these 23 fortifications was 4 lakh Huns annually
 balaghat or konkan ke kshetra shivaji ko milenge par unhen iske badale main 13 kishton main 40 lakh hun adaa karne honge
 Apart from this, they will also give revenue of 5 lakh Huns every year
 shivaji swayan aurangzeb ke darbar main hone se mukt rahenge par unke putr shambhaji ko mughal darbar main khidamat kerani hogi
 Shivaji will support the Mughals against Bijapur
 shivaji ko agra bulaayaa gaya jahaan unhen laga ki unhen uchit sammaan nahin mil rahaa he
 Against this, he showed his fury in the court and accused Aurangzeb of betrayal
 aurangzeb isse kshubdh hua or usne shivaji ko nazarkaid kar diya or unpar 5000 sainikon ke pehre laga diye
 Aurangzeb intended to kill King Shivaji a few days later
 lekin apane ajod saahas ore yukti ke saath shivaji or sambhaaji donon isse bhaagane main safal rahe
 Shivaji Maharaj went to Banaras after leaving Sambhaji in Mathura with a believing Brahmin, went to Puri and went safely to Rajgarh
 isse maraathon ko navajivan sa mil gaya
 Aurangzeb suspected Jaisingh and got him murdered by poisoning him
 jaswant singh ke dwaara pahal karne ke baad san 1668 main shivaji ne mughalon ke saath duusari baar sandhi kii
 Aurangzeb recognized Shivaji as the king
 shivaji ke putr shambhaji ko 5000 kii manasabadari mili or shivaji ko puna, chaakan or soopa kaa jila lautaa diya gaya
 However, the Mughal suzerainty over Sinhagad and Purandar remained
 san 1670 main surat nagar ko duusari baar shivaji ne lutaa
 Shivaji got the property worth 132 lakhs from the city and while returning he defeated the Mughal army again near Surat
 san 1674 tak shivaji ne un saare pradeshon par adhikaar kar liya tha jo purandar kii sandhi ke antargat unhen mughalon ko dene pade the
 After the establishment of an independent Hindu nation in western Maharashtra, Shivaji wanted to crown his coronation, but Muslim soldiers threatened the Brahmins that whoever crowned Shivaji would be killed
 When this thing reached Shivaji that the Mughal Sardar is making such threats, then Shivaji took it as a challenge and said that now he will get anointed from the Brahmin of that state who is in the authority of the Mughals
 Shivaji's personal secretary Balaji sent three emissaries to Kashi, because Kashi was under the Mughal Empire
 When the messengers gave the message, the Brahmins of Kashi were quite pleased
 But the Mughal soldiers came to know about this and then caught those Brahmins
 But wisely those Brahmins told those messengers in front of the Mughal sannyko that we do not know who Shivaji is
 What line are they from? The messengers did not know that is why they said we do not know
 Then in front of the Sardar of the Mughal soldiers, those Brahmins said that we have to go somewhere else, from which clan Shivaji you have not told, so how can we crown him
 We are going on a pilgrimage and no other Brahmin will get the coronation until Kashika is fully introduced, so you can go back
 The Mughal Sardar was happy and left the Brahmins and thought of catching the messengers and sending them to Aurangzeb to Delhi, they too escaped silently
 After returning, he told this thing to Balaji Awa and Shivaji
 But surprisingly after two days the same Brahmin reached Raigad with his disciples and crowned Shivaji

 vibhinn rajyon ke duuton, pratinidhiyon ke alaava videshi vyapaariyon ko bhi is samaaroh main aamantrit kiya gaya
 But 12 days after his coronation, his mother had died, for this reason, on 4 October 1674, Shivaji assumed the title of Chhatrapati for the second time
 do baar hue is samaaroh main lagbhag 50 lakh rupee kharch hue
 The establishment of Hindu Swaraj was announced in this ceremony
 vijaynagar ke patan ke baad dakshin main yah pehla hindu samrajya tha
 Like an independent ruler, he introduced a coin in his name

 Shivaji had the eldest son Sambhaji and a second son named Rajaram from his consort
 us samay rajaraam kii umr maatr 10 varsh thi atah maraathon ne shambhaji ko raja maan liya
 Seeing the demise of Aurangzeb King Shivaji at that time, with the desire to rule his whole India, he went out to conquer South India with his 500,000 army
 aurangzeb ne dakshin main atehi adilshaahi 2 dino main ore qutubashhi 1 hi dino main khatam kar di
 But the Marathas, under the leadership of King Sambhaji, maintained their independence while fighting for 9 years
 aurangzeb ke putr shahjada akbar ne aurangzeb ke kilaaf vidroh kar diya
 Sambhaji gave him shelter in his place
 aurangzeb ne ab phir joardaar tareeke se sambhaji ke kilaaf akraman karnaa shuru kiya
 Finally, in 1689, Sambhaji's wife's brother, Sambhaji, by the mouth of Ganji Shirke, made Sambhaji a prisoner by Mukarav Khan
 aurangzeb ne raja sambhaji se badasluki kii or bura haal kar ke maar diya
 Seeing his king being mistreated by Aurangzeb and badly hit, the Pura Maratha Swarajya became angry
 unhone apni puri takat se teesraa rajaraam ke netritv main mughalon se sangharsh jari rakhaa
 Rajaram died in 1700 AD
 uske baad rajaraam kii patni tarabai 4 varshiya putr shivaji dwitiya kii sangrakshika banakar raaj karti rahi
 Ultimately 25 years of tired Maratha war fighting of the kingdom was buried in the self-rule of Shivaji, the same chhatrapati of Aurangzeb
 shivaji ko ek kushal or prabud samraat ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Although he did not get much traditional education in his childhood, he was familiar with Indian history and politics
 unhone shukracharya tathaa kautilya ko adarsh maanakar kootneeti kaa sahaara lenaa kai baar uchit samajha tha
 Like his contemporary Mughals, he was also an autocratic ruler, that is, the entire reins of governance were in the hands of the king

 Ramchandra Amatya, with the help of a scholar named Dhundhiraja, composed a book called 'rajyavarthakosh'
 is kosh main 1380 farsi ke prashasnic shabdon ke tulya sanskrit shabd the
 Ramchandra has written in it- shivaji ek samarpit hindu the tathaa vah dharmik sahishnu bhi the

 This brings a generous element to his character
 usek baad unhone pita kii hatya nahin karwaai jaisaa ki anya samraat kiya karte the
 He got his coronation only after the death of Shahaji Raje, although by that time he had become independent of his father and became the ruler of a large empire
 unke netritv ko sab log sweekaar karte the yahi kaaran he ki unke shasankaal main koi aantarik vidroh jaisi pramukh ghatana nahin hui thi
 He was also a good diplomat with a good commander
 kai jagahon par unhone sidhe yuddh ladane kii bajaay yuddh se bhaag liya tha
 But this was his diplomacy, which always supported him in defeating the biggest enemy

 Heinrich Otto Warburg was a biochemist and researcher from Germany
 inaki maan kaa naam elizabeth gartner or pita kaa naam amil warburg tha, jo berlin vishvavidhyalay main bhautikashastri the
 Amil was a friend of Einstein and also worked with Max Planck
 oto ne 1906 main berlin vishvavidhyalay se rasayanashastra main doctrate kii or 1911 main hidelburg vishvavidhyalay se doctor of medisin kii degree praapt kii thi
 After this he continued to research in Heidelberg for some time
 lekin 1913 main unhen berlin ke pratishthit wilhem institute four biolaji main niyukti mil gai
 He also served in the Army during World War i and received the Iron Cross Medal
 lekin ainstin ne unhen sena chhodane par vivash kiya or apni pratibha or amuly samay ko maanav kalyaan hetu shodh kaaryon main lagane kii prerana di
 In 1931, he was awarded the post of director of Wilhelm Institute

 After World War II, it was renamed Max Planck Institute
 biswein dashak ke prarambh main dow oto ne jivit koshikaon dwaara oxigen kaa udgrahan karne kii kriya par shodh shuru kiya tha
 In 1923, he developed a special pressure measuring instrument for this, which he named the Warburg Menometer
 yah menometer jaivik utak kii patali si tah dwaara bhi oxigen ke udgrahan kii gati ko naapane main sakasham tha
 He did much research on the elements that catalyze respiration and then discovered the oxygen-transport enzyme cytochrome, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1931
 oto ne pehali baar batalaaya tha ki cancer koshika saamaanya koshika kii tulana main bahut hi kam oxigen grahan karti he
 He also researched hydrogen cyanide and carbon-mono-oxide and reported that they inhibit respiration
 unhone kii jeevarsayan kriyaaon ke liye sahaayak upaghatak nicotinomide or dihydroginej anzim aadi kaa bahut adhyayan kiya
 They also proved that there is a direct correlation between the ph and oxygen consumption of a cancer cell
 yadi piech zyada he to koshika main oxigen kii maatra zyada hogi
 He also explained that due to the formation of lactic acid and carbon-dioxide in the cancer cell, the ph is very low around 6

 Lindo's revised lecture by Otto Warburg director, Max Planck Institute, cellular structural science
 berlin-dehlem, Germany
 angreji sanskaran - dean bark, neshnal cancer institute, bethesda, maryland
 Brief Description by Dean Burke - This lecture was given by Otto Warburg at the 1966 annual session of the Nobel Prize winners in Lindau, Germany
 unhen 1931 main koshikeey-shwasan main oxigen-parivahan anzim kii khoj ke liye medisin main nobel puraskaar diya gaya tha or 1944 main bhi hydrogen-parivahan anzimes ke liye sakriy tatwon kii khoj ke liye bhi nobel puraskaar diya jane vaala tha, parantu aisa kaha jaataa he ki oto yahudee mul ke naagarik the isliye adolf hitler nahin chaahate the ki unhen nabell puraskaar diya jaye
 Universities like Harvard, Oxford and Heidelberg awarded him doctorates and other titles
 jivan ke bhautik-vigyaan or rasayan-vigyaan main unki bahut ruchi thi
 There are main and secondary or secondary causes of any disease
 udhaaharan ke taur par plig kaa mukhya kaaran plig kaa keetanu he, jabaki dwitiyak kaaran gandagi, chuuhe or pissu hai
 The main reason is that it is present in every patient suffering from that disease
 isi tarah cancer ke bhi anginat dwitiyak kaaran ho sakate hai
 But the main cause of cancer is the normal cellular respiration by oxygen being disrupted and converted to fermentation of sugars
 sharir kii sabhi koshikaayen oxigen dwaara shwasan karke urja praapt karti hai, jabaki cancer koshika sharkara ko khamir karke urja praapt karti he
 All normal cells are actually airborne and cancer cells are partial non-living organisms that carry on life by fermenting glucose like low-level unicellular organisms
 bhautik or rasayanashastra kii drushti se saamaanya or cancer koshika main yah antar mahatvapurn he
 Cancer research was being done at the Dehlem Institute right from the beginning
 yahan oxigen-parivahan anzim hydrogen-parivahan anzimes kii khoj hui or unki rasaynic sanrachana kaa baariki se adhyayan kiya gaya
 If it is true that the main cause of cancer is normal oxygenation by oxygen inhibiting and converting to fermentation, then without exception all cancer cells will respire by yeast and normal cells will never respire by yeast
 do america vaigyanikon melmagraine or flenegan ne saral prayog se yah siddh kiya tha
 They released spores of tetanus into the blood of mice, which sprout and break up in the absence of oxygen and give rise to germs that spread tetanus
 unhone paaya ki chuuhe swasth the or unamem titains rog ke koi lakshan dikhaai nahin de gahe the, kyonki unke sharir main kahin bhi aisa sthaan nahin tha jahaan paryaapt oxigen vidyaman nahin ho
 But when the spores of tetanus were released into the blood of cancer-infected mice, the mice became infected with tetanus disease, because the amount of oxygen inside the cancerous knots in their body was so low that the spores of the tetanus sprouted and the germs of the tetanus came out
 And the mice became infected with tetanus disease
 in prayogon se yah spasht ho jaataa he ki cancer koshikaaye aanshik avayujeevi or saamaanya koshikaaye vayujeevi hoti hai
 We try to understand a different kind of experiment here that shows quantitative relationships between cancer malignancy and cancer growth
 herold moris, neshnal cancer institute, bethesda ne apane prayogon main jab alag-alag sakriyata vaale liver cansarkaarak tatv jab chuhon ke rakt main chode to dekha ki chuhon main jo cancer kii ganthen hui unki vruddhi-dar bhi alag-alag thi
 It means to say that where a rat's lump doubled in three days, it took 30 days for another rat's knot to double
 neshnal cancer institute ke hi dean bark or mark woods 3 ne alag-alag hepetomaz main khamirikaran kii dar or hepetoma ke badhane kii dar ko ek graph dwaara pradarshit kiya
 They found that there is a direct quantitative correlation between yeast and growth rate
 unhone dekha ki jaise jaise hepetoma kii vruddhi-dar badhati he, khamirikaran bhi usee anupaat main yaa or teji se badhata he
 Dean Burke and Mark Woods find the rate of fermentation in the zero-point region of their graphs to be so low that it is not possible to measure it by conventional methods, whereas the minimum growth rate of the knot in the same region can be easily measured
 lekin jab unhone sharkara ke khamirikaran ko naapane ke zyada samvedansheel tareeke viksit kiye to siddh ho gaya ki bahut dhire-dhire badhane vaale cancer bhi sharkara ko khamir karte hai
 Now it has been proved that consuming sugar by leavening sugar is a special feature of cancer cells, so let us try to understand how a normal cell becomes non-living by converting into a cancer cell
 
 iske liye ham dehlem institute ke gahen, gayasler or lorenj dwaara kiye gayi prayogon ko samajhane kaa ytn karte hai
 When the cells of the rat embryo were kept in a suitable medium where oxygen levels were also sufficient, they continued to perform pneumatic respiration in the presence of oxygen, dividing, and fermentation
 lekin jab oxigen kaa str itnaa kam kar diya ki koshikaon kii viviya shwasan-kriya aanshik rup se baadhit hone lagi to 48 ghante main do koshikeey vibhaajan ke baad ve khamir karne vaali cancer-koshikaon main roopaantarit ho gai
 And she started breathing anaerobically
 phir hamane vibhajit ho rahi bhrun-koshikaon main oxigen kaa dabaav or khamirikaran ko naapane kaa yantra viksit kiya, jo sanlagn chitra main spasht dikhaaya gaya he
 In this system, we saw that the cells got transformed into cancer cells after reducing the pneumatic respiration by 35 percent
 yadi sharir main oxigen kaa dabaav itnaa kam ho jaye ki vibhajit ho rahi koshikaon kii viviya shwasan-kriya 35 pratishat baadhit ho jaye to cancer ho jaataa he
 This proved that when the pneumatic respiration in the body is partially obstructed, cancer cells start to form and begin to respire through fermentation
 hamaari prithvi ke vikaas ke praarambhik daur main vaataavaran oxigen rahit tha or jivan ke naam par sirf avibhedit ek-kosiya khamir dwaara shwasan karne vaale jeev hi vidyaman the
 Then billions of years later, when oxygen arrived in our atmosphere, these indistinguishable unicellular organisms began to differentiate, pneumatic respiration, and thus the growth of flora and fauna on Earth began
 lekin yah avibhedan ham aaj bhi cancer koshikaon main dekh rahe hai
 We also see that cancer often develops even when there is not enough oxygen in the atmosphere, because either the dividing cells are not getting enough oxygen or the cells do not have the active elements that catalyze respiratory-enzymes
 Huh
 lekin jo bhi sthiti ho cancer main hameshaa oxigen-shwasan baadhit hota he, khamirikaran hota he or koshikaayen avibhedit hone lagati hai
 Cancer cells have the ability to divide unnecessarily uncontrollably, and all the functions necessary for life are lost
 arthath jab shwasan baadhit hota he, cancer janm letaa he, tab jivan kaa astitv to rahata he, par vah vibhajit ho rahi dishaheen koshikaon ke samooh ke sivaa kuch nahin hota he
 Now the question is why does oxygen penetrate and why does lack of oxygen discriminate? Or why respiration pierces and fermentation discriminates
 jabaki shwasan-kriya or khamirikaran donon hi koshika vibhaajan karne main sakasham hai or yadi khamirikaran main bhedan kii kshamta bhi hoti to shaayad is prithvi par cancer kaa astitv hi nahin hota
 In this way, there are many questions whose explanation may possibly give biochemistry
 shwasan-kriya or khamirikaran donon main hi phosphate urja prayukt hoti he lekin donon main phosforilation kaa tarika alag-alag hota he
 In the context of cancer, pneumatic phosphorylation is capable of penetrating, but yeast phosphorylation does not have this capability
 shwasan or khamirikaran ke chayapachay-path se spasht he ki piruvik acid banane tak donon ke chayapachay-path main koi fark nahin he
 But after this, the action path of both of them is different
 khamirikaran main piruvik acid ek hi rasaynic kriya main diahydro-nicotinomide dwaara apaghatit hokar lactic-acid banataa he
 Whereas in pneumatic respiration, pyruvic acid undergoes many complex chemical reactions in the presence of oxygen to form water and carbon dioxide
 mukhya bindu • It is easier to inhibit respiration than fermentation because respiration is a more complex process
 • shwasan-kriya baadhit hone par koshikaaye badi saralata se khamirikaran karne lagati hai kyonki donon kriyaaon main ek hi utprerak nicotinomide kaary karata he
 • When normal respiration in the cell is interrupted and fermentation takes place, glucose decomposition occurs and the cell dies due to lack of energy
 glucose ke apghaton kaa matlab he khamirikaran dwaara mrityu or avayaviya shwasan kaa matlab he khamirikaran dwaara jivan
 • Cancer occurs only because respiration gives cells the ability to penetrate, not fermentation
 ant main main yahi kahana chahta hoon ki ab cancer koi rahasyamay rog nahin rah gaya he or iskaa pramukh kaaran sabake saamne spasht he
 We should work towards prevention from cancer
 aakhir kab tak chemotherapy or radiotherapy se jude laalchee bahurashtriya santhaan cancer par hui shodh kaa laabh aam logon tak nahin pahunchne denge or unhen bhramit karte rahenge
 Probably till then crores of people in this world will keep dying from this disease
 warburg kaa vyaakhyaan bahut hi rochak tha
 It was such a revolutionary event in the world of science that he first exposed the importance of oxygen in respiration to the world
 lekin mujhe is baat kaa behad khed ki ve dow budwig kii khoj se apni purnatah anbhigya rahe yaa aankhe munde rahe
 The above lecture he gave 15 years after the great discovery of Budwig
 dow budwig ne vah rahasyamay kadi dhund lee thi, jise ve khojate rahe or hameshaa asafal rahe
 These days, Dr
 Budwig was successfully treating cancer patients with linseed oil and cheese and was also getting 90 percent success
 dow budwig ne ek baar kaha tha ki ve yah chaahati thi ki dow oto unki mahaan khoj linolic or linolenic acid or koshikeey shwasan main unke mahatv ko samajhen
 In 1952, Budwig sent his papers to Dr
 Otto several times and expressed his desire to meet him, but Otto did not respond
 budwig ne apane ek saakshaatkaar main saint gorgi ke bare main bhi kade shabdon main kaha tha ki unhone mere saare shodhpatr pard rakhe the, mere shodh-kaaryon se puri tarah waakif the parantu phir bhi apni pustak electronic biology and cancer main meri khoj ke bare main zikr nahin kiya
