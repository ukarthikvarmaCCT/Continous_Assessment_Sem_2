is puraskaar ke vijeta is prakaar hain: Sahitya Akademi started the new award for young writers from 2011
 is puraskaar ke vijeta is prakaar hain: Samuel Finley Breeze Morse was an American who built a single-wire telegraph system and Morse code
 or unhen aitihaasik drishyon ke ek chitrakaar ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 Samuel F
 B
 Morse was born in Charles Town, Massachusetts, the first child of a geographer and pastor Jedidiah Morse and Elizabeth Ann Finley Breeze
 jededia kelvinist dharm ke mahaan upadeshak the or america federalist party ke samarthak the
 He considered this party not only a patron of the Puritan traditions but also believed in the idea of a treaty with Britain in relation to a strong central government
 jededia apane bete kii padhai ke liye ek sanyukt ruparekha ke saath-saath kelvinist khoobiyon, naitikta or prarthana par gaharaa vishwaas rakhte the
 After studying at Phillips Academy in Endover, Massachusetts, Samuel Morse attended Yale College, where he studied religious philosophy, mathematics, and horse science
 yel main adhyayan ke dauraan unhone benjamin franklin or jeremia de ke dwaara vidyut vishay par die gaye vaktavyon main bhaag liya
 He made money through painting
 In 1810, he graduated from Yale with Phi Beta Kappa honors
 morse ke kelvinist vichaaron kaa pramaan unki painting da landing of pilgrims main miltaa he, jisamen saadhaaran libaas or chehre ke kathor haav-bhav chitrit kiye gaye hai
 This picture depicts the psychology of the Federalists; Calvinists from England brought ideas related to religion and government to the United States, which always connected the two countries
 Primarily, this particular work caught the attention of renowned artist Washington Alston
 alston chaahate the ki morse unke saath england jaaen or kalakaar benjamin west se milen
 jededia ke saath ek samjhauta kiya gaya jiske anusaar unke teen saal tak england main rahane kii baat tay ho gayi or navayuvak morse 15 july 1811 ko ledia ke liye jahaaj par ravaanaa ho gaye
 Arriving in England, Morse worked hard to improve his painting techniques under Alston's supervision; By the end of 1811, he was admitted to the Royal Academy
 academy main, unka rujhaan renecense kii nayi shastreey kala kii ore ho gaya or unhone mikelangelo ore rafel kii ore kareebi se dhyaan diya
 After observing and practicing his lively paintings, this young artist successfully created his masterpiece, The Dying Hercules
 kuch logon ke liye, da daaing harculej british or america federalist ke viruddh ek rajanithik vyakhya kaa pratinidhitiv karti hui prathit hoti he
 The muscles symbolize the power of the young and vibrant United States against British and British American supporters
 jab morse britain main the, us samay america or british log 1812 ke yuddh main vyast the or vafadari ko lekar sanyukt rajya ke samaaj main vibhaajan hua
 America's anti-federalist elements joined with France and hated the British and believed that a strong central government could pose a threat to democracy
 jaise-jaise yuddh chalata gaya, unke matapita ko likhi chitthiyon main unke federal-virdohi vichaar dikhaayi dene lage
 In one such letter, Morse said, "I think that the Federalists of the northern states have done more harm to their country than the French by their fierce rebellion
" unki karrwai ko angreji samachar-patron main nakal kiya jaataa he, sansad main padhaa jaataa he or unke puure desh main vitarit kiya jaataa he or ve unke bare main kya kehete hai
 xxrep 10 
 They call them cowardly, low caste people, they say that they are traitors and they should be hanged like traitors
 " haalanki jededia ne apane rajnatik vichaar nahin badale, par unhone morse ko alag tareeke se prabhavit kiya
 It is certainly clear that Jedidiah's Calvinist ideas were a core part of Morse's other important English work, the Judgment of Jupiter
 badalon main jupiter apane garud ke saath he, uske haath partiyon ke upar hai or vah jajment kaa uccharan kar rahaa he
 The expressions of Marpessa appear to be full of shame and malaise, apologizing and dedicating themselves to her husband's arms
 idaas, jo namratapurvak marpesa se pyaar karata he, vah utsukata se use lene ke liye aage bad rahaa he, jabaki apollo aashcharyachakit hokar use ghur rahaa he
 


 He is surprised at the unexpected decision 


 yah is baat kaa dyotak ho saktaa he ki jupiter bhagwaan kii shakti kaa pratik he, jo uske har kadam par najar rakhe hue hai
 Through this picture, Morse is teaching morality on infidelity
 haalanki marpesa ek shikaar hai, unhen yah ahsaas he ki unki anant mukti aavashyak he or unhone galat tareekon se munh mode liya he
 Apollo does not regret his actions, but he stands up in a confused state
 unnisvin sadi ke prarambh main bahut se america chitron main dharmik tatv or rang dikhaayi dete hai, lekin morse hi unamem sabase agrani the
 Through the Judgment of Jupiter, Morse expressed his support for ideas against his Federalism, while retaining his metaphysics
 yah kaary kelvinavaad ke madhyam se america rashtrawaad kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, kyonki england se nikaale gaye in vyaktiyon ne british ko baahar nikaalane or ek swatantra loktantratmak samaaj kaa nirmaan karne main yogadan diya
 West wanted to present this image at another Royal Academy exhibition; Unfortunately the time was up
 21 agast 1815 ko unhone england chhod diya or ek america chitrakaar ke rup main apana phul-time karier shuru kiya
 The years 1815–1825 saw much development in Morse's paintings, in which he was trying to convey the essence of America's culture and life
 unhen purv federalist raashtrapati jon adams kaa chitra banane kaa gaurav praapt hua
 He wished to be a part of larger projects, and the opportunity was created by a fight between the Federalists and the anti-federalists at Dartmouth College
 unhone charlston, dakshini kerolina main kamishan kii maang kii 
morse kii shrimati emma quesh kii painting charlston ke aishwarya kaa pratik thi
 For some time, it seemed that this young painter is doing a great job for himself
 1819 or 1821 ke bich, morse ne apane jivan main ek bahut bade parivartan kaa anubhav kiya
 The commission in Charleston was scrapped when the city saw a financial meltdown
 jededia par apane mantri pad se istipha dene ke liye dabaav daalaa gaya, kyonki ve kelvinavaad ke bich daraar ko rokane main asafal rahe the
 a new branch called Congregational Unitarian was created, which was anti-federalist and deniable, because people had a different view of slavery
 haalanki ve apane pita ke dharmik vichaaron kaa sammaan karte the, unhen advaitvaadiyon ke saath sahanubhuti thi
 a prominent family who followed neo-calvinism was Pickering of Portsmouth, whose painting was made by Morse
 is chitra ko anti federalysm kii ore jhukaav ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 One could argue that he was completely infected towards anti-federalism when he was appointed to photograph President James Monroe
 monro ne jeffrsonian loktantr ko saakaar rup diya or iske liye ve kuleen vyaktiyon se zyada aam aadmi kaa paksh lete the; baad main unhone andryu jackson ke udgam par par jor diya
 There were two important commissions that shaped Morse's career in art, returning from New Haven until the founding of the National Academy of Design
 da haul of congress or marquis de laughyete ne morse kii loktantric rashtrawaad kii bhaavana ko uljhan main daal diya
 This artist decided to paint the House of Representatives to show the activism of American democracy

si
 gaye, uhone saavdhaneepurvak painting main assi logon ko darshaya or unka maananaa tha ki ek raat kaa drishy upyukt hoga
 He successfully balanced the architecture of Rotunda with Figurines and the illumination of the lamp was shown as the main point of this work
 chitra main, logon ke jode, akele khadey hue log or desk par jhuk kar kaam karte hue logon ko darshaya gaya, inhen bahut saadhaaran rup se chitrit kiya gaya tha lekin unke chehre vishesh rup se parilakshith hote the
 Morse chose night time instead of day to reflect Congress' dedication to the principles of democracy
 haalanki, haul of congress, neuyark shahar main bheed ko chitrit karne main asafal rahaa
 Probably a major reason for this disappointment was John Trumbull's Declaration of Independence, which gained popularity in the 1820s
 sambhavatya kuch logon ne america sarkaar ke aantarik kriyapranali kii prashansa nahin kii 
 Morse received much respect for the painting of the Marquis de Lafayette, who was the main supporter of the American Revolution
 ve ek aise vyakti kaa bhavy chitra bananaa chaahate the jisane ek mukt or swatantra america kii sthapana kii ghoshnaa kii
 In his portrait, he depicts Lafayette with a beautiful sunset, showing three munchies, two of which depict Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, and the third is preserved for him
 unke neeche ek shantipurna lakdi kaa dhalaan dikhaaya gaya he, jo pachaas saal ke baad kii america shanti or vruddhi ko chihnit karata he
 The growing friendship between Morse and Lafayette and the discussion of the Revolutionary War influenced the artist upon his return to the city of New York
 
 Morse lived in Europe for three years from 1830–1832, during which he increased his skills in painting and traveled to Italy, Switzerland and France
 antat unhone jo pariyojna chuni vah thi ek hi kenvas par lore kii prasidd 38 chitrakaariyon ko sankshep main chitrit karnaa, jise unhone da geleri of da lore kaa sheershak diya, unhone america lautne par is kaam ko puraa karne kii yojana banaayi thi
 Subsequently during a visit to Paris in 1839, Morse met Louise Daguerre and became interested in his latter's daguerreotype, the first practical means of photography
 morse ne new-yark observar ko is avishkaar kaa varnan karte hue ek patr likhaa, jise vyapak rup se america press main prakashit kiya gaya or isane bahut adhik jaagrukta failaayi
 In 1825, New York City gave Morse $ 1,000 to paint the Marquis de Lafayette, Gilbert du Motier in Washington
 is chitrakaari ko banane ke dauraan, ghode par savaar ek doot unke pita kaa patr laayaa, jisamen keval ek hi line likhi thi, "tumhaari patni mar gayi he"
 morse tunrat washington se apane ghar new haven ke liye ravaanaa ho gaye or laughyete kii tasviir adhuri chhot gayi
 When he arrived there, his wife was buried
 jab unhen yah pataa chalaa ki unki patni kaa swasthya kharaab tha or ve akeli hi mar gayin or ve is bare main anjaan rahe, to unka dil tut gaya or unka dhyaan chitrakaari se hatakar kisi aise saadhan kii khoj kii ore chalaa gaya jisase lambi duuri tak teji se kisi samachar ko pahunchaaya ja sake
 During his sea voyage to the house in 1832, Morse met Charles Thomas Jackson of Boston who was well educated in electromagnetism
 jackson ke vidyut chumbak par vibhinn prayogon ko dekhakar, morse ne ekal-taar telegraph kii avadharana kaa vikaas kiya or da geleri of da lore ko ve bhul hi gaye the
 Morse's original telegraph containing the patent application is housed at the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institute
 usee samay se morse code duniya main telegraphy kii praathmik bhashaa ban gayi or aankadon ke talbaddh sancharan ke liye abhi bhi maanya he
 William Cook and Professor Charles Whetstone had reached the stage of starting a commercial telegraph before Morse, but they were able to start it only later
 1836 main, england main, cook ne morse ke chaar saal baad ek vidyutiya telegraph ko shuru kiya, lekin yah adhik vittiya sroton se yukt tha
 Cook left his primary subject of physiology
 or teen saptahon ke bheetar ek chota vidyutiya telegraph banaaya
 Whetstone was also experimenting with telegraphy and understood that a single large battery cannot carry a telegraphy signal for long distances
 And it was also understood that innumerable small batteries will be more successful and effective in this task
 cook or vahitstone ne ek saajhedaari kii or may 1837 main vidyutiya telegraph kaa patent kiya or kuch hi avadhi main ve great western railway ko ek 13-mile telegraph kii taar uplabdh kara chuke the
 In a letter to his friend, Morse describes a challenge to protect his patent on the electromagnetic telegraph

 !! Could you believe ten years ago that a question could be raised on this subject? ' morse ko taar ke kuch sau gaj se zyada duuri tak telegraphic signal le jane main samasya kaa saamana karnaa padow unki safalataa professor leonard gail kii antardrushti se praapt hui jo neuyork vishvavidhyalay main rasayan shaastra ke shikshak the 
 With Gayle's help, Morse was soon able to send a message through a ten-mile wire
 yah morse kii ek mahaan safalataa thi
 Morse and Gayle were soon joined by an enthusiastic youngster, Alfred Veal, who was highly skilled, insightful, and wealthy
 morse kaa telegraph ab bahut teji se viksit hone laga
 In 1838, Washington, D
C
 In his journey, he failed to obtain a federal sponsorship for a line of telegraphs
 iske baad morse sponcership or patent donon praapt karne ke liye europe gaye, lekin unhone landan main paaya ki cook or wheatstone pehle se hi vahaan sthapit ho chuke hai
 Morse required the financial support of Maine Congressman Francis Ormond Jonathan Smith
 morse ne 1842 main washington, di

 On May 24, 1844, the line was officially opened, Morse sent the famous words "what hath God wrought" via wire from the b&o's Mount Claire station in Baltimore to the Capitol building
 These words were derived from the Bible and were chosen by Anne Ellsworth, daughter of the American Patent Commissioner Henry Levitt Ellsworth, who encouraged Morse's invention and also helped fund it
 may 1845 main magnetic telegraph company kii sthapana kii gayi neuyork shahar se philadelphia, boston, buffelo, neuyork or mississippi tak telegraph kii linon ko vitarit kiya ja sake
 Once Morse also adopted the idea of wheatstone and Carl August von Steinheil that an electric telegraph signal be transmitted through a water body or through a steel railroad track or through a conductor
 He tried hard to win a lawsuit to gain the right to be called the "inventor of the Telegraph" and tried to represent himself as an inventor, but Alfred Weal also played an important role in the invention of the Morse code, which was electrical The magnetization was based on prior code for the Telegraph
 semul morse ne 1847 main istambul main old belarbeyi peles main telegraph ke liye ek patent praapt kiya, jise sultan abulmesid ke dwaara jari kiya gaya tha, jisane vyaktigat rup se nayi khoj kaa pareekshan kiya

 itihaaskaaron main matbhed he ki morse ne ek sakasham telegraph ke vichaar ko apana patent praapt karne se atharah saal pehle harrison grey dayar se praapt kiya tha
 According to a report published on 3 April 1872 in the New York Times, besides being appointed as member in various science and arts associations in the US and other countries, Morse received the following honors: Atiq nishani-iftikhar's honor), Sultan Ahmed of Turkey a set of diamonds from Ibn Mustafa, a golden snuff box from the King of Prussia containing the Prussian gold medal for scientific merit
 ; The Great Gold Medal of Arts and Science from the King of Wüttemberg; The Great Gold Medal of Arts and Science from the Emperor of Austria; a cross from the Emperor of France to Chevalier in the Légion d'honneur; The Cross of a Night of the Order of the Denbrog from the King of Denmark; Cross of Night Commander of the Order of Isabella the Catholic from the Queen of Spain
 Other awards include Order of the Tower and Sword from the Portuguese Empire; sanyukt rajya america main, morse kaa telegraph kaa patent kai varshon tak bana rahaa, lekin is par zyada dhyaan nahin diya gaya or is par vivaad uthte rahe
 In 1853, the patent case was presented before the Supreme Court, after a long investigation, Chief Justice Roger B
 Tenney ruled that Morse was the first to conjugate batteries, electromagnetism, and convert electromagnets and correct battery configurations into a functional practical telegraph
 6 phir bhi, is spasht nirnay ke baavjood, morse ko ab tak sanyukt rajya kii sarkaar se koi adhikarik manyata praapt nahin hui he
 In collaboration with the US Ambassador in Paris, European governments were attracted to how they have long neglected Morse despite using the discovery
 us samay ek vyapak manyata thi ki kuch kiya janaa chahie or "1858 main morse ko france, austria, belgium, da netherland, peadmont, rus, sweden, tuskani or turki kii sarkaron ne 400,000 francisi frank kaa puraskaar diya, in main se prayek desh ne apane desh main prayukt kiye ja rahe morse ke upkarnon kii sankhya ke anusaar apana share diya," 7 abhi bhi sanyukt rajya america main unhen koi manyata nahin di gayi thi

 Slavery is not a sin
 yah saamaajik sthiti he jo duniya ke shuruyaat se hi apni budhimaani, mangalakaari or anushaasanamak daivik buddhi ke liye chali aa rahi he
 Therefore, keeping slaves is a situation in which there is no moral character other than to become a guardian, a servant, or a ruler

 Muscle contraction occurs in this state
 jab actine tathaa myosin apane sthanon par sarak jate hai to sarcomear purv avasthaa main aa jate hai tathaa peshiyaan shithil ho jate hai
 Energy for muscle contraction comes from ATP
 peshi sankuchan main Ca++ aayan ATP ko ADP main badal dete hai
 The special property of muscle is to retract, which makes its length shorter and more width, that is, it becomes shorter and thicker

 bhaavana mood, swabhaav, vyaktitv tathaa zajbaat or preranaase sambandhit he
 The English word 'emotion' has its origin from the French word émouvoir
 yah latin shabd emovere par aadhaarit he jahaan e- kaa arth he 'baahar' or movere kaa arth he 'chalanaa'
 sambandhit shabd "prerana" kii atpatti bhi movere se hui he
 No definitive classification of emotions exists, although several classifications have been proposed
 inamen se kuch vargeekaran hai: The related difference between emotion and the consequences of emotion is the main behavioral and emotional expression
 apni bhaavnaatmak sthiti ke parinamswaroop aksar log kai tarah kii abhivyaktiyaan karte hai, jaise ronaa, ladanaa yaa ghrinaa karnaa
 yadi koi bina koi sambandhit abhivyakti ke bhaavana prakat kare to ham maan sakate hai kii bhaawanaaon ke liye abhivyakti kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 Neuroscientific research suggests that there is a "magic quarter second" during which the thought can be known before an emotional response is formed
 us pal main, vyakti bhaavana ko niyantrit kar saktaa he
 The James – Lang theory states that experiences of bodily changes result in large-scale emotion sensations
 bhaawanaaon ke prati kriyaatmak drushtikon, se pataa chalata he ki bhavanaaen kisi vishesh kriya ke falswaroop ek vishay ke rup main surakshit rakhane ke liye ubhari hai
 There are some basic and complex categories, where some basic emotions can be converted into somewhat complex emotions
 In a situation, complex emotions can arise due to cultural conditions or alliances associated with basic emotions
 vaikalpik rup se, mul rangon ke mishran ke anuroop,mul bhavanaaen maanav kii bhaawanaaon ke anubhav se mil kar bhaawanaaon kaa purna indradhanush bana sakati hai
 For example a mixture of mutual anger and hatred can lead to contempt
 robert plutchik ne ek triayami "sarkamplex model" prastaavit kiya he jo bhaawanaaon ke bich sambandhon ko darshata he
 This model is similar to a colored circle
 lambavat maap tivrata ko darshaate hai or sarkal bhaawanaaon ke bich samanta kii degree bataata he
 They arranged the eight primary emotions into pairs of four opposite emotions
 kuch log meta imoshans ke astitv ke bare main bhi tark dete hai jo bhaawanaaon ke bare main bhavanaaen hai
 Another meaning of specific emotions is related to their timing
 kuch bhavanaaen kuch second kii hoti hai, jabaki kuch kai saalon tak rah sakati hai 
 baad vaali ko ek lambi avadhi kii pravriti ke rup main mana ja saktaa he jisame ek uchit bhaavana kii bajaay keval kisi ke prati lagaav kii bhaavana he 
 bhaavnaatmak ghatnaon or bhaavnaatmak swabhaavon ke bich antar he
 Temperament is also comparable on the basis of character traits in which one's disposition usually varies according to the experience of particular emotions for different objects
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek chidchida vyakti aam taur par dusron kii bajaay jaldi athwa tezi se chidh jaataa he
 Finally, some researchers classify emotions into a general category of 'affective state', where affect / aroused situations also include emotion-related events such as happiness and pain, emotional conditions, mood, mood, and symptoms

 Researchers concluded that when experiencing hatred, a specific figure forms in people's brains
 saanchaa:emotion Theories related to emotions carry the ideas of ancient Greece to Plato and Aristotle
 hamen rene descartes, barook spinoja or david hum jaise darshanikon ke kaam ke rup main parishkrut siddhant bhi milte hai
 Later theories related to emotions have resulted from advances in research
 zyaadaatar siddhant alag nahin hai or kai shodhakartaaon ne apane kaam main vibhinn drushtikon shaamil kiye hai
 According to the somatic theory of emotions, the body reacts directly to emotions rather than to essential judgments
 is tarah ke siddhanton kaa pehla aadhunik sanskaran 1880 main wiliam james ne prastut kiya
 The theory lost support in the 20th century, but recently it has gained popularity again as a result of neurological evidence from researchers such as John Cachioppo, Antonio Damasio, Joseph E
 Leidu and Robert E
 Zajonc
 wiliam james ne ek lekh 'whot iz en imoshan?', ke dwaara yah tark diya ki zyaadaatar bhaavnaatmak anubhav shaareerik badlaavon ke kaaran hote hai
 Around this time Danish psychologist Karl Lang also introduced a similar theory, so it is known as the James – Lang theory
 is siddhant or iske tathyon ke anusaar, paristhiti ke badalane se shaareerik badlaav hota he
 As James puts it, "the concept of physical change is emotion"
 James claims that "we feel sad because we cry, angry during a fight, afraid to tremble, and it may happen that, in an apology, we do not cry during anger or fear
" Fight or shiver is siddhant ko prayogon dwaara sabit kiya gaya he, jisame sharir kii sthitiyon main badlaav laa kar vaanchit bhaavana praapt kii jaati he
 This type of experiment has also been used in medicine
 james-lang's theory is often misunderstood because it is contradictory
 zyaadaatar logon kaa maananaa he ki bhavanaaen, bhaavana sambandhit kriyaaon ko badhaava detii hai : jaise "main ro rahaa hoon kyonki main udhaas hoon", yaa "main bhaaga kyonki main dar gaya"
 iske vipareet, james-laing kaa siddhant jor detaa he ki ham pehle sthiti ke anusaar pratikriya karte hai or iske baad ham apni kriyaaon ko bhaavnaatmak pratikriya se jodate hai
 In this way, emotions explain and organize our own actions
 james-laing ke siddhant ko ab zyaadaatar chaatro dwaara nakaar diya gaya he
 According to the following statement by Tim Dalgleish: The james-lang theory has remained influential
 Its main contribution is the emphasis it places on the embodiment of emotions, especially the argument that changes in the bodily concomitants of emotions can alter their experienced intensity
 Most contemporary neuroscientists would endorse a modified james-lang view in which bodily feedback modulates the experience of emotion
" a problem with james-lang's theory is that it focuses on the consequences of action, not on the physical effects of emotional experiences
 
 mastishk sanrachana kii tantrikaon kii masping se mili jaankaree se, maanav bhaawanaaon kii neurobiological vyakhya yah he ki bhaavana ek priy yaa apriy sthiti he jostandhari ke mastishk main paidaa hoti he
 If it is compared to reptiles, the development of emotions will be similar to the transformation of normal bone animals into mammals, in which the neurochemical fluctuates according to the level of brain activity, which causes the body to move, mood swings
 And is reflected in the postures
 udhaaharan ke liye, pyaar kii bhaavana ko standhari ke mastishk ke peleocircuit kii abhivyakti mana jaataa he, jisase dekhbhaal, bhojan karaane or sondarya jaisi bhaawanaaon kaa bodh hota he
 Paleosurkits are a means of displaying bodily emotions by nerves that were formed millions of years before the cortical nerve was formed
 isamen pehle se bane hue raste yaa mastishk ke agle hisse, brain stem tathaa meru rajoumein tantrika koshikaon kaa jaal hota he
 They originated even before the ancestors of mammals to control actions, almost around the time of jawless fish
 mana jaataa he ki, standhari ke mastishk ke viksit hone se pehle, jaanwaron kii zindagi, swachaalit, sachet or nappi tuli thi
 The body of reptiles responds to sensory signals of vision, voice, touch, chemistry, gravity, with predetermined body movements and postures
 raat main sakriy hone vaale stanadhariyon ke aagaman ke saath, lagbhag 180 million varsh pehle, gandh ne ek prabhavi tantrika ke rup main drushti kaa sthaan le liya or soonghney vaali tantrika ke madhyam se pratikriya karne ke or raste bane, jo ki mana jaataa he ki aage chal kar stanadhariyon kii bhaawanaaon or bhaavnaatmak yaaddaasht ke rup main viksit hue
 jurassic kaal main, stanadhariyon ne sarisrupon kii tulana main apni soonghney kii kshamta kaa safaltaapurvak upyog kiya - isiilie stanadhariyon ke mastishk kighran tantrika kaa bhaag sarisrupon kii tulana main bada hota he
 These odors slowly became the blueprint of nerves, which later formed the structure of our brain
 mana jaataa he ki bhavanaaen mastishk ke us kshetra kii kaaryashiltaa se sambandhit he jo hamen nirdesh detaa he, hamaare vyavhaar ko prerit karata he or hamaare ird gird hone vaali ghatnaon ke mahatva kii vyakhya karata he
 Important discoveries by Broca, Papez, and mclean suggest that emotions are associated with a group of structures in the middle of the brain called the limbic system, including the hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, hippocampi, and other structures
 haal hi main hue anusandhanon se pataa chalaa he ki isamen se kuch limbik sanrachanaayen, dusron ke vipareet, bhaawanaaon se us tarah se sidhi nahin judi hai jabaki kuch gaiyr limbik sanrachanaayen adhik mahatv kii pai gayin hai
 There is substantial evidence that the left prefrontal cortex is activated by stimuli that are produced by positive thinking
 yadi aakarshak uttejnaa mastishk ke chuninda hisse ko sakriy kar paae to tark purna dhang se ulta hona chahie, arthath adhik sakaaratmak dhang se nirnay lene ke liye mastishk ke us hisse kii chuninda kriyasheeltaa ko uttejnaa utpann kerani chahie
 iskaa pradarshan madhyam aakarshan vaale uttejk drishyon ke saath kiya gaya tha or baad main iskaa vistaar karke nakaaratmak uttejnaa ko shaamil karke ise doharaaya gaya
 Neurobiological models in the prefrontal cortex revealed two opposite results of emotion
 The valence model predicted that anger, which is a negative emotion, would activate the right prefrontal cortex
 The Direction Model predicted that anger is an attitude sense, so will activate the left prefrontal
 The second model received support
 haalanki abhi bhi kai sawaal anuttarit hai ki prifrantal cortex main drushtikon kii behatar vipareet paribhaasha kya he, dur janaa, bina kisi pratikriya ke, kintu takat tathaa pratirodh yaa bina kisi pratikriya ke niskriy parinaam 
 sharmaane tathaa vyavhaar sambandhit baadhaon par hue shodhon se ection tendency model ko samarthan mila he 
 "homeostatic bhavanaaen" sharir kii aantarik avasthaa dwaara utpann zajbaat hai, jo hamaare vyavhaar ko vyavasthit karte hai
 Thirst, hunger, feeling hot or cold, feeling deprived of sleep, a desire to eat salt and a desire for air are all examples of homeostatic feelings; Each of these is a signal given by the physiological system that says "everything is not right
 piyo / khao / chaaya main jaao / kuch garam pahano / so jaao / namakeen tukdaa chato / saans lo
" isamen se kisi bhi pranali kaa santulan kharaab hone par, ham homeostatic bhaavana kaa anubhav karne lagate hai or yah bhaavana hamen vahi karaati he, jo us pranali kaa santulan banaae rakhane ke liye aavashyak he
 Pain is a homeostatic feeling that tells us “everything is not well
 peeche hato or bacho"
 There are some theories that argue that cognitive action - a judgment, evaluation, or thought - is necessary to produce an emotion
 richard loras ke anusaar yah is tathy ko pramanit karne ke liye aavashyak he ki bhaavana kisi chiz ke bare main yaa jaanboojh kar paidaa hoti he
 This type of cognitive activity can be conscious or subconscious and may or may not take the form of a conceptual process
 yahan loras kaa ek prabhaavshaalee siddhant he : bhaavana ek baadha he jo nimna kram main utpann hoti he : 1
) sangyanatmak moolyankan-vyakti us ghatana kaa tarkpurna akalan karata he jo bhaavana ko ingit karti he
 2
 Physiological changes - Cognitive responses result in biological changes, such as increased heartbeat or a response to pituitary adrenal
 3
 Action - The person experiences the emotion and chooses to react
 udhaaharan ke liye: jeni ek saanp dekhati he
 1
) Jenny sees the snake, which makes her scared
 2
) Her heart starts beating hard
 adrellin kaa rakt main pravaah tej ho jaataa he
 3
 Jenny yells and runs away
 loras jor dekar kehete hai ki bhaawanaaon kii gunvattta or tivrata ko sangyanatmak pratikriyaaon dwaara niyantrit kiya jaataa he
 These responses form a rescue strategy that forms an emotional response according to changes in the individual and his environment
 bhaawanaaon se sambandhit kuch siddhant ye tark dete hai ki bhaavana ke utpann hone ke liye nirnay, moolyankan yaa vichaaron ke rup main sangyanatmak kriya aavashyak he
 a prominent philosophical lecturer is Robert C
 Solomon
 a second example of this is a theory proposed by Niko Frijda according to which trends occur due to evaluation
 yah suzav bhi diya gaya he ki bhavanaaen aamtaur par soochna ko kriyanvit karne tathaa vyavhaar ko prabhavit karne ke liye shortkat kii tarah prayukt hoti hai
 a new hybrid theory of the somatic and cognitive theory of emotions is the perceptual theory
 yah siddhant is tark main alag he kii shaareerik pratikriyaayein, bhaawanaaon par kendrit hai, tathaapi ye bhaawanaaon kii sarthakata par jor detii he yaa is vichaar par, ki bhavanaaen kisi chiz ke bare main he jaisaa ki sangyanatmak siddhanton dwaara paaya gaya he
 The new claim of this theory is that imagined cognition is unnecessary for this type of meaning
 balki shaareerik parivartan khud ko paristhitiyon ke kisi karanvash kriya main badalane ke kaaran bhaawanaaon kii sarthak saamagree ke hisaab se dhaal lete hai
 In this regard, emotions correspond to the power of the mind, such as sight or touch, which in various ways gives us information about the relationship between the object and the world
 is drushtikon kaa ek parishkrut bachaav darshanik jesi prinz kii pustak gat riyekshanz or manovaigyanik james layerd kii pustak feelings main paaya gaya
 It is a communication theory developed by Howard M
 Wise and Russell Cropanzeno, which focuses on the causes, structures and consequences of emotional experiences
 yah siddhant bataata he ki bhavanaayen ghatnaon dwaara prabhavit or ghatit hoti hai jo parinamswaroop nazariye or vyavhaar ko prabhavit karte hai
 This theoretical framework also emphasizes the time in which a person perceives the experience and what is called an emotional episode - "a sequence of emotional conditions that increases over time and is organized around a core theme
 " is siddhant ko kai shodhakartaaon dwaara bhaavana ko sanchaar ke dwaara behatar dhang se samajhane ke liye prayukt kiya gaya he or is par howard em vaais tathaa danniel je bill dwaara apane lekhonriflaction on afective events theory main samiksha kii he jo 2005 main research on imoshan in orgenigeshns main prakashit hua
 In the Canon Bard theory, Walter Bradford can contrast with james-lang's effective theory on the physical facts of emotion in the Canon Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear, and Rage 
 jahaan james kaa tark tha ki bhaavnaatmak vyavhaar aksar aage kii or badhata he yaa bhaavana kii vyakhya karata he, canan or board kaa tark tha ki pehle bhavanaaen utpann hoti hai or uske baad vishisht vyavhaar utpann hota he
 Another cognitive theory is the Singer – Shafter theory
 yah prayogon ke abhipraayon par aadhaarit he jo bataata he ki ek hi maansik avasthaa main hone ke baavjood adrenelin ke ek injaikashan dwaara vyaktiyon kii vibhinn bhaavnaatmak pratikriyaayein ho sakati hai
 Individuals were observed expressing anger or happiness in line with the sentiment expressed according to the situation of the other person
 is prakaar, sthiti ke moolyankan or pratibhaagi dwaara adrenelin yaa plasebo lene ke sangyojan ne ekasaath pratikriyaayein nirdhaarit kin
 is prayog kii jesi pinz kii gat riyekshanz main aalochana kii gai he
 a recent version of cognitive theory roughly describes emotions as being at the same time a number of different physiological and cognitive components
 bhavanaaen samgr prakriya dwaara pahachaani jaatin hai jisase kam str kaa sangyanatmak moolyankan, vishesh rup se praasangik prasanskaran main, shaareerik pratikriyaaon, vyavhaar, bhaawanaaon or kriyaaon ko shuru karata he
 Emotions have been worked on in many different disciplines
 maanav vigyaan maansik prakriyaaon main bhaawanaaon kii bhoomika, vikaron or tantrika tantra ke bare main bataata he
 In psychology, emotions are examined in subject-related studies and in the treatment of mental disorders in humans
 manovigyaan bhaawanaaon ko maansik prakiyaayein maanate hue unki ek vaigyanik pariprekshya se jaanch karata he or antarnihit shaareerik or snaivik prakriyaaon kaa pataa lagaataa he
 Scientists in sub-branches of neuroscience, such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, study the nervous system of emotion by linking neuroscience to psychological studies of personality, emotion, and mood
 bhashaa vigyaan main, bhaavana kii abhivyakti dhvaniyon ke arth main badal sakati hai
 In the field of education, the relationship with the emotions of the learning process is being investigated
 saamaajik vigyaan aksar baatcheet maanav samskruti or samjik sahabhaagita main bhaavana kii bhoomika kii jaanch karata he
 In sociology, the role of emotions in human society, social structure and participation and culture is examined
 maanav vigyaan main, maanavtaa ke adhyayan main, chaatr praasangik vishleshan tathaa maanav gatividhiyon kii simaaon kii vipareet samskritiyon kii tulana ke liye ethnography kaa prayog karte hai; kuch anthropology adhyayan maanviya kriyaaon main bhaawanaaon kii bhoomika kii jaanch karte hai
 In the field of communication science, students from important organizations have examined the role of emotions in the organization, from the perspective of managers, employees, and even customers
 sanghathanon main bhaawanaaon par dhyaan dene kaa shrey arli rassel hoshchild kii bhaavnaatmak shram kii avadharana ko jaataa he
 The University of Queensland hosts emonet, an email distribution list that reflects a network of academies that facilitate discussion with scholars of all matters related to organizational conditions
 is suchi ko janvari,1997 main sthapit kiya gaya tha, or duniya bhar main iske 700 se adhik sadsy hai
 In economics, the social science that studies production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, emotions are being analyzed in some subfields of microeconomics to make purchasing decisions and understand risk
 aparaadhashastra - aparaadh ke adhyayan kaa ek samjik vigyaan drushtikon, chaatro ko aksar vyavhaar vigyaan, samaaj shaastra or manovigyaan kii ore aakarshith karata he; aparaadhashastra ke muddon main anomi theory or "berahami", aakraamak vyavhaar or gundgardee jaisi bhaawanaaon kii jaanch kii jaati he
 In law, which is supportive of civil obedience, politics, economics and society, evidence about people's sentiments is often presented for claims of physical compensation and used against alleged law breakers in criminal law prosecutions

 The poem of this period is the story of a clean feeling of beauty and a sad heart that is far from the beloved, which is also the ideal of the emotions of Baloch tendency

 The nature of Baloch literature was also influenced by the performance of his knowledge and arts

 In 1947, when independence was found, the Baloch language like other provincial languages of Pakistan also progressed

 Vijayanalam is a noted litterateur of the Malayalam language
 inke dwaara rachit ek upanyaas gursagaram ke liye unhen san 1990 main sahitya academy puraskaar se sammanit kiya gaya
 When many people of the community try to fulfill the same purpose simultaneously, it is a collective event called 'janariti'
 yah ‘janariti’ ek peedi se duusari peedi ko hastaantarit hoti rahati he is prakaar hastaantarit hone ke dauraan ise samooh kii adhikadhik abhimati praapt hoti jaati he, kyonki prayek peedi kaa safal anubhav ise or bhi drudh bana detaa he, yahi 'pratha' he
 Sometimes humans follow these practices similar to laws
 kyonki use samaaj kaa bhay hota he, use bhay hota he lokaninda kaa or use bhay hota he saamaajik bahishkaar kaa
 As is evident from the above discussion, only organized, firm demographics that are passed on from generation to generation, recognized by society, are called 'practices'
 pratha vastav main saamaajik kriya karne kii, sthapit va maanya vidhi he
 People believe this because most of the people of the society have been working or behaving according to the same method for a long time
 is prakaar ‘pratha’, ‘janariti’ kaa hi ek praudh rup he, jiske saath saamaajik abhimati yaa sweekruti judi hui hoti he
 The practice is related to the folk customs used for a long time
 duusare shabdon main, iske antargat ve kriyaayein aati hai, jinhen pidiyon se sweekaar kiya jaataa rahaa he
 Due to these practices, we feel some hesitation in performing new activities
 vyakti kaa vyavhaar prathaon se prabhavit hota he
 According to maciver and Page, pro boguards ne prathaon or paramparaon ko ek hi maanate hue unki paribhaasha dete hue kaha he, Sapirne has also written, parantu pro boguardeski uparokt paribhaasha se yah na samaj lenaa chahie ki pratha or parampara ek hi hai
 In fact there is enough variation among them
 in donon ke antar ko spasht karte hue ross ne likhaa he ki, is
 ’’ To clarify the nature of the practice, it is necessary to know its characteristics- ‘pratha’ kaa aadhaar samaaj he, par ise jaanboojhkar nahin banaaya jaataa, apitu saamaajik antalakriya ke dauraan iskaa vikaas hota he
 The 'practice' is the genetics which is passed on from generation to generation
 iskaa paalan keval isliye kiya jaataa he ki ek lambe samay se anek vyakti iskaa paalan karte aa rahe hai
 'practices' are practices of behavior that go on for many generations and thus gain stability in the group
 iske peeche samooh yaa samaaj kii adhikadhik abhimati hoti he
 In fact, the successful experience of many generations makes it strong
 ‘pratha’ roodhiwaadee hoti he, is kaaran ise saralata se badla nahin ja saktaa or parivartan kii gati bahut hi dhimi hoti he
 There is no organization or power to punish those who create, practice and break the 'custom'
 samaaj hi ise janm detaa or lagu karata he
 The ability to control the behavior of every type of human being is very large in practices
 maanav ke jivan main, bachapan se lekar mrityukaal tak, inkaa prabhaav padataa rahata he
 To clarify the nature of the practice, Zinsburg considered it necessary to distinguish between 'practice' and 'habit'
 aapane likhaa he ki, According to Zinsberg, in order to understand the nature of the practice well, the difference between 'fashion' and 'fashion' has to be understood
 kabhi-kabhi yah kaha jaataa he ki fishan kriya kii taatkaalik samanta he; arthath iske prabhaav se prayek vyakti vahi karata he jo har doosraa aadmi kar rahaa he; or is tarah yah anukaran par aadhaarit hota he
 But 'practice' is a gradual equality of action
 duusare shabdon main, pratha ke anusaar kaam karte hue prayek vyakti vahi karata he jo sadaiv se kiya jaataa rahaa he or is tarah pratha anivaary rup se aadat par aadhaarit hoti he
 But there is a much more important difference between the two
 sarvapratham- pratha, samaaj kii sadaa bani rahane vaali moulik aavashyaktaaon se sambandhit maaloom padati he; jabaki fishan kaa prabhaav jivan ke kam maarmik or kam saamaanya kshetron main dikhaai detaa he
 Fashion is essentially dynamic and dynamic
 vastav main fishan baar-baar hone vaale parivartanon kaa ek silsilaa hota he or praayah anukaran or naveenta isaki visheshta hoti he
 In contrast, the practice is essentially static and uninterrupted
 or usamen parivartan sadaiv dhime-dhime hi hota he
 There is no doubt that there are some fashions that do not change, but when this happens, they do not really remain fashion, but become custom
 duusare shabdon main, unako ateet or vartmaan donon kaa hi sammaan praapt hota he
 The second thing is that motivational elements are different in practice and fashion
 


 pratha kaa anusaran isliye hota he ki bhootkaal main praayah iskaa anusaran hua he, jabaki fishan kaa isliye ki vartmaan main uskaa anusaran ho rahaa he
 In addition, fashion is a way of symbolizing innovation, and its essential basis is found in a fervent desire to separate oneself from the other
 iske vipareet, pratha kaa jor bahut‘ kuch is tathy par aadhaarit hota he ki iske dwaara samaaj naveenta ke khataron se apana bachaav kar saktaa he
 That is, the basis of practice is the desire to make oneself similar to the past and archaic of others
 saadharantaya prathaon or janaritiyon ko ek hi mana jaataa he
 But in reality these two are different views
 prathaen vastav main janaritiyaan na hokar unka hi viksit rup hai
 No group behavior can take the form of practice until it has received social acceptance
 is rup main janaritiyon ko samuhik vyavhaar kaa pratham pag kaha ja saktaa he or prathaon ko du saraa pag
 In addition, the practices are also more permanent and powerful than the generals
 itnaa hi nahin, saamaajik niyantran ke ek saadhan ke rup main, prathaon kaa mahatv janaritiyon se kahin adhik badhkar hai
 The practice does not originate in a single or single day
 kisi bhi pratha kaa vikaas dhire-dhire or kaaphi samay main hota he
 Many new requirements come before human beings in daily life
 inamen se kuch aisi hoti hai jo samooh ke adhiktar logon se sambandhit hoti hai
 Therefore, an attempt is made to find the means to fulfill such common needs
 yah saadhan sarvapratham ek vichaar yaa avadharana ke rup main ek vyakti ke dimag main aata he
 a person acts according to this idea and tries to know whether that need can be met in that way
 yadi vah apane is prayaas main safal hota he to bhavishya main bhi waisi hi aavashyaktaa aa padane par use vah baar-baar doharaata he
 Repeating it becomes her personal habit
 jab duusare log pratham vyakti ke safal vyavhaar yaa kriya kii vidhi ko dekhte hai; to ve bhi us vidhi ko apana lete hai
 When that method of behavior spreads in the society, it is called Janariti
 jab janariti ek peedi se duusari peedi ko hastaantarit hoti rahati he to use pratha kehete hai
 Thus an idea leads to the development or development of a personal habit, a personal habit to genetics, and genetics to practice
 is prakaar pratha kii utpatti main ateet or vartmaan donon kaa hi yogadan rahata he
 Wunt wrote, yah kathan shri ginsburg ke anusaar is arth main sahi he ki rivaaj ek sammilit sristi or hajaaron antalakriyaaon kii upaj hota he
 But it should not be understood that behind the practice there exists the existence of a great soul or the common soul of society
 antim rup main kisi vyaktigat aadat ke saath anya vyaktigat aadaton ke milane se hi pratha kaa janm hota he
 The result of each of them being influenced by the other and influencing the other is that in the end its form becomes stable as a combined product
 isi ko ham pratha kehete hai
 As Hobhouse has written - saamaajik jivan main pratha ke mahatv ko kisi bhi rup main asweekaar nahin kiya ja saktaa
 In fact, in primitive or simple societies, they have more importance than state law
 iskaa ek vishesh kaaran he or vah yah he ki saral samaajon main vyaktiyon kaa jivan atyadhik roodhiwaadee hota he, saath hi dharm dwaara atyadhik prabhavit hota he
 Therefore, they are not able to violate the practice in any way
 iske atirikt, chunki pratha peedi-dar-peedi hastaantarit hoti rahati he, atah inkaa ulanghan purvajon kaa apmaan mana jaataa he
 This importance of the practice will become even more clear with the following discussion
 main asafal rahen or isiilie unke dwaara saamaajik aavashyaktaaon kii purti na ho
 Such practices often obstruct the progress of society
 parantu kuch anupayogi prathaon kaa chalan dekhakar hamen is bhram main nahin padana chahie ki prathaen arthhin va nirarthak hoti hai
 Practices have great importance in social control
 prathaen vyakti ke vyavhaaron ko kaaphi seemaa tak niyantrit karti hai
 Although there is no such legal power behind which individuals can be pressurized to get them persuaded, yet human beings are not able to violate the practices for fear of social reproach
 prathaen chunki pichhali pidiyon kaa safal anubhav hoti hai, atah vyakti inhen jaldi hi maan letaa he kyonki nae vyavhaaron ko karne main use hichkichaahat tathaa bhay kii anubhuti bhi hoti he
 Practices have more impact than laws in primitive and simple societies
 iskaa ek vishesh kaaran yah he ki is prakaar ke samaajon main vyaktiyon kaa jivan atyadhik roodhiwaadee hota he, saath hi dharm dwaara adhik prabhavit hota he
 Therefore, they are not able to violate the practice in any way
 iske atirikt, chunki prathaen peedi-dar-peedi hastaantarit hoti hai, atah inkaa ulanghan purvajon kaa apmaan mana jaataa he
 Shakespeare called the practices 'cruel practices', Montane the 'angry and traitorous school-masterney', Bacon called 'the chief judge of man's life' and Locke 'greater power than nature' is
 ginsburg ne prathaon kii saamaajik niyantran main bhoomika ke varnan kii vyakhya karte hue likhaa he, That is why practices gain social consensus and it is on this that they control and conduct the behavior of the person and thus help in social control
 pracheen samaaj chota or saral hota tha or prayek vyakti ek-du saare ko bahut-kuch vyaktigat rup se jaanata-pahachaanata tha
 Also, there was neither rapid change in social life nor serious social problems
 isliye prathaon ke dwaara hi saamaajik niyantran kaa kaary saralata se ho jaataa tha
 But the practices in modern society are totally inadequate and social control only by them is impossible today
 iske chaar pramukh kaaran hai- Thus it is clear that the practices are inadequate for modern society and the whole work of social control cannot be done by them at all; This is why today the importance of practices is decreasing day by day and the importance of law is increasing

 ye nirdesh saral yaa jatil ho sakate hai
 Such orders have certain standard instructions
 ve is prakaar se hai
 a stop loss is the value of a stock or index at which the transaction is closed after reaching it
 vittiya bazaar main kisi bhi kharide jane vaale share ke bhav ke upar jane kii sambhaavna bhi hoti he or neeche jane kii ashanka bhi bani rahati he
 If the stock price starts to fall, then it can reach quite low
 atev share kray karte samay hi iske stop los ko tay kiya jaataa he
 For example, if a share of 100 rupees is taken, then it should be sold when it comes to 95 or 90 rupees
 isse adhik neeche bhav pahunchane par bhi ise kis keemat tak rakhana he, yaa bechnaa he; yahi stop los hota he
 According to the experts, it is more beneficial to decide about stop loss while buying shares
 yah suvidha brokar ke computer main uplabdh hoti he
 Successful and experienced stock investors always keep an eye on return estimates and stop losses
 stop los ko stop order bhi kaha jaataa he
 In the table of the rising price data of a stock, the place where the share price crosses the trend line and goes down, is the stoploss of that stock
 isi tarah mandi ke saudon main bhav jahaan trend line ko katkar upar aa jaae, vahiin un saudon kaa stoplos hota he
 When stoploss is increased or decreased with sentiment, it is called trailing stoploss
 ye kai prakaar ke hote hai: The graph of the price of a stock ascending in the market from which it turns downward, the position or position is called the top or the top
 isi tarah girte hue bhav main graph jahaan se chadhana shuru kar detaa he, vahiin bottm kehalaata he
 Top and bottom have great importance in technical analysis
 yadi kisi chart main har aglaa top or bottm kramash: pichley top or bottm se ooncha ho, to share yaa suchakank teji ke daur main kehalaata he
 Similarly, if every next top and bottom in a chart is below the previous top and bottom respectively, then the stock or index is considered in a recession
 share ke bhav ke baar chart main kisi share ke har din ke ucchtam or nunatam bhaavon ko ek sidhi rekha se jodne par jo rekha milti he, rujhaan rekha yaa trend line kehalaati he
 The falling stock's trend line draws the line from the highest price of that stock, while the line is drawn from the lowest price to draw the trend line of the rising stock
 behatar parinaam hetu kisi ek din ke ucchtam yaa nunatam bhav kii jagah kai dinon ke ucchtam yaa nunatam bhaavon ke ghanatv vaale kshetron se rekha khinchi jaati he
 The trade line is extremely helpful for investors, also known as the trend is the best friend in English
 trend tuutane kaa arth hota he ki share kii chaal kii disha badalane vaali he
 That is, if the stock price is falling and the prices of the stock suddenly start coming upwards after cutting the trend line drawn from above, then it should be understood that the edge is going to start
 iske ulat agar chadhate hue share yaa index ke nichle bhav se khinchi gai rujhaan rekha keemton ke upar jane lage, to teji ke saude kaat lene chahie
 By tracking returns and estimating returns, profit-recovery is simplified when the investor is informed of financial goals
 yah is nirnay ko aasaan banaata he ki niveshak ko kisi kaarobaar vishesh main nivesh karnaa laabhprad he yaa nahin
 According to experts, if the return-risk ratio is not in favor then it should not be traded
 jaise, yadi 100 rupye ke lakshya ke saath 90 rupye kaa koi share kharidte hai or stop los 75 rupye se neeche he to ritern-jokhim anupaat paksh main nahin he
 In this case, after selling the shares at the target price, they are willing to take a loss of Rs 15 per share for an expected profit of Rs 10 per share
 is tarah se ritern kii tulana main jokhim adhik he or samajhadaari he ki is share main paisa na lagaaein
 Thus stop loss information is very helpful in deciding to invest
 adhikansh vishleshkon ko lagata he ki trederon ko jokhim sahane kii kshamta ke aadhaar par stop los tay karnaa chahie

 Kring originally designed the series to have an ever-changing role
 However, his plan changed when he found out that the original cast was highly popular in the audience, so for the second season, he took on most of the first season's cast, along with a few additional actors who had received star ratings
 In its first season, the show went on to become the third-largest cast in American primetime television, behind Desperate Housewives and Lost, by featuring 12 main actors simultaneously
 Although the cast page of the first season of NBC listed only ten characters, Leonard Roberts, who first appeared in the series' fifth episode, was an additional member joining the original full-time cast
 In the eleventh episode of the first season, Jack Coleman was promoted from a recurring role to a twelfth full-time member

 Simone was the first major character to be dropped out of death at the end of season one

 Heroes developed in early 2006, when Tim Kring, creator of nbc's Crossing Jordan, introduced the concept to the program
 Kring wanted to create a "big ensemble saga" that could connect with audiences
 He started thinking about how big, scary and complex the world is and he wanted to create a series focused on characters that could do something about it
 Kring realized that there were not so many big characters in a police officer or medical drama who could save the world
 He considered superheroes, ordinary people who discover extraordinary abilities while living in the real world and reality
 Casting directors Jason La Padura and Natalie Hart meet some ventures such as Milo Ventimiglia, who in the first episode "introduced the common man as a character drama with increasing reality
" a reality that was brought to light through the work of production designer Ruth Ammon
 Kring wanted points in the series that incorporated the characters and their world

 The episode has a different structure: after a brief recap of relevant events, each show begins with a puzzle, sometimes beginning with the scene that was introduced in the previous week's episode
 Mostly Mohinder Suresh talks about the title or event in a philosophical voice
 At a dramatic turn, the screen cuts to the graphic title, which shows that the Earth is turning into a solar eclipse, with the Belly Bead performance showing the Heroes logo and the musical pause written by Kring himself
 The title of the episode is usually shown after the title scene, which is followed by a commercial break
 After the first commercial break, the title of the episode usually appears on an earthly object within the scene
 The title is presented as a chapter, each chapter having a number, which connects it to the episode number of that part
 The list of initial names usually appears in alphabetical sequences of the preceding name
 Many characters' stories are shown throughout the episode
 Sometimes these stories are lonely incidents, while sometimes the stories of other characters come in and move forward
 At this point, Suresh provides the final voiceover and most of the episodes end with an interesting twist or suspense, which is shown just before the smash cut with the "continue to" graphic
 jab lekhan team ek episod par kaam karti he, prayek lekhak ek charitra letaa he or uske irdagird ke akele drishy likhata he

 The second season saw a WGA writer strike, meaning that only 11 of the planned 24 episodes would be produced
 This forced the producers to redesign the season by incorporating only Generations out of the three episodes planned according to the predetermined plan
 The third planned part, Exodus, which originally reflected the effects of 138 variants of the peace virus in the story, was canceled
 The fourth planned part, Villain, was replaced in the third part and moved to season three
 The closing scenes of part two of "powerless" had to be re-filmed due to the cancellation of Exodus, and all the ends had to be tied to the loose ends of Generations

" Tim Molloy of TV Guide stated that Heroes will return to their origins from the fourth part
 The fugitive is an attempt to attract new viewers and bring back viewers who left the show due to excessive characters and storylines
 Fugitives begin with Nathan Petrelli telling the president that there are people who have superhuman abilities
 The President authorizes Nathan to capture such individuals, and all the main characters, except Xylor, gather to escape the reach of Nathan's agents in an attempt to locate his biological father
 Heroes enlist the help of a mysterious colleague, Rebel, who is later revealed to be Micah Sanders

 Music from the first season is composed by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman with music engineer Michael Perfitt and vocals by Shankar
 Each episode has an average of thirty to thirty five minutes of music
 Melvoin and Coleman were added to Heroes because of their previous work with executive producer Alan Arkush
 Tim Kring gave the pair general instructions including the emotion and direction of each character
 Kring wanted incredibly unusual music and therefore gave Wendy and Lisa the freedom and permission to experiment
 In the pilot episode, Kring suggested that a "fictional" cue be used in a scene in a burning car, played by Claire Bennett
 The "fictional" cue has since become an identity mark of the show

 On May 14, 2007, NBC announced that during the 2007–2008 season, the network would broadcast Heroes Origins, a sequel to the six-episode Heroes
 Each week a new character was to be introduced in the show and the audience had to choose who would be in the regular series of the next season
 The reason for airing this episode was stated to be a mid-season hiatus, due to which the ratings of Heroes faltered when they returned in the first season
 NBC President Kevin Raley told reporters on 14 May 2007, "we have something that i call a" big challenge "for the next year, which is trying to make our schedule more consistent for viewers
 We asked Tim Kring to tell us a plan and what i liked best is that not only do we have 30 hours of content for the next season but it will be a completely new suggestion that i think will show the show Will take you to the next level
 " The show was scheduled to air in April 2008 after the conclusion of the second season of Heroes, which was announced at the 2007 comic-con International
 The second season of Heroes and the first season of Heroes: Origins had a total of 30 episodes

 mujhe aashaa he ki kisi bindu par yah punah shuru hoga lekin abhi sirf prasaarit ho rahe sho ke vishay main hi jaankaree uplabdh he
" On 3 April 2008, Ben Silverman confirmed the cancellation of Origins, a day after NBC announced its prime time schedule
 The co-president of NBC Entertainment and Media Universal Studios said, "we were putting a lot of pressure on our creative team 


 We wanted thirty-five of Heroes and twelve episodes of Heroes: Origins, each with a short film and backdoor pilot As it was supposed to be

 manovidalita yaa antarabandh kai maansik rogon kaa samooh he jinamein bahya paristhitiyon se vyakti kaa sambandh asaadhaaran ho jaataa he
 Some time ago, despite the symptoms being slightly different, the primary cause of the disease was believed to be the same
 kintu ab praayah sabhi sahamat hai ki antarabandh jivan kii dashaon kii pratikriya se utpann hue kai prakaar ke maansik vikaron kaa samooh he
 Interface is also known as Dementia Precox in English

 In mental hospitals, 55 percent of the patients are found in this disease and such patients are not less than 25 percent for the first time visitors
 is rog kii chikitsa main bahut samay lagane se is rog ke rogiyon kii sankhya aspataalon main uttarottar badhati rahati he
 It is estimated that two to three percent of the general population suffer from this disease

 Of the patients admitted to hospitals, 40 percent soon become sick
 shesh 60 ko jeevanaparyant yaa bahut varshon tak aspataal hi main rahanaa padataa he
 There are usually four forms of this disease: saamaanya rup main vyakti apni chaaro ore kii paristhitiyon se apane ko dhire-dhire khinch letaa he, arthath apane suhridon, mitron tathaa vyavsaay se, jinase vah pehle prem karata tha, udasin ho jaataa he
 In another form, which is called puberty, the patient's thoughts and actions are based on confusion

 In the third form, the limb of the brain becomes distorted
 yaa to uske angon kii gati atyant shithil ho jaati he, yahan tak ki vah mudh or nishcesht sa padaa rahata he, yaa vah ati prachand ho jaataa he or bhaagane, daudane, ladane, akraman karne yaa hinsaatmak kriyaayein karne lagata he
 The fourth form appears in older age and is ideological
 rogi apane ko bahut bada vyakti maanata he, yaa samajhataa he ki vah kisi ke dwaara sataaya ja rahaa he
 How many times, more than one form is found in the patient
 na keval yahi, pratyut anya maansik rogon ke lakshan bhi antarabandh ke lakshanon ke saath prakat ho jate hai
 Many kinds of theories were made regarding the cause of disease which depended on anatomy, biochemistry or mental disorders

 jowarbhata bal vah bal he jo ek vastu apane gurutvkarshan se kisi duusari vastu par sthit alag-alag sthanon par alag-alag str se lagaati he
 This is the reason for the fluctuations of tides in the sea on Earth
 angrezi main "jowarbhata bal" ko "tidel force" bolte hai
 When the moon exerts its gravitational effect on the earth, the water that is closest to it rises towards the moon
 is se us ilaake main jowar aata he 
 The water on the right and left side of the earth also drains and goes towards the front, which causes reflux in those areas
 prithvi ke peeche kaa jo pani he vah chandramaa se sab se dur hota he or khichaav kam mahasoos karata he, jis se vahaan bhi jowar rahata he
 The effect of the tidal force of the moon is not limited to water
 prithvi kii zamin par bhi iskaa asar hota he
 If the full effect is seen, then the earth's sphere becomes slightly pinched by tidal force
 khagolashastra main ek rosh seemaa kaa niyam he
 In this, if an object falls within the limit of a planet, then that planet exerts such a tidal force on it that the object can be broken by breaking
 hamaare saura mandal ke chathe grah shani ke upgrahi challe kuch isi tarah hi bane hai
 In general, if debris is orbiting around a planet, it becomes a satellite by joining it over time
 lekin agar yah rosh seemaa ke andar ho to jowarbhata bal kii pichakan use judane nahin detii
 If a ready-made satellite or comet also deviates within the Roche range, it can be broken

 Today, "game theory" is like an umbrella or 'unified field' theory for the logical side of social science in which 'social' is interpreted to include human as well as other players
 game theory ke paaramparik anuprayogon main in gemon main samyavasthaayen khojane kaa prayaas kiya jaataa he
 In equilibrium, each player of the game adopts a policy that they might not change
 is vichaar ko samajhane ke liye samyavastha kii kai sari avadharanaen viksit kii gai hai 
 The motivation of these concepts of equilibrium varies and depends on the field in which they are being used, although their meanings are somewhat intermingled and harmonized
 yah paddati aalochana rahit nahin he or samyavastha kii vishesh avadharanaon kii upyuktata par, samyavasthaaon kii upyuktata par or aamtaur par ganitiya modelon kii upyogita par vaad-vivaad jari rahete hai
 Although there were already some developments in this area, the field of game theory came into existence with John von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern's 1944 book Theory of Games and Economic Behavior
 is siddhant kaa vikaas bade paimaane par 1950 ke dashak main kai vidwaanon dwaara kiya gaya
 Later game theory was explicitly used in biology in the 1970s, although it had begun only in the 1930s
 game theory kii pahchaan vyapak rup se kai kshetron main ek mahatvapurn upkaran ke rup main kii gai he
 Eight Game Theorists have won the Nobel Prize in Economics, and John Maynard Smith has been awarded the Crowford Prize for experimentation in biology of game theory
 game theory main awalokit game spashtatya paribhaashit ganitiya 'objects'hote hai
 a game is made up of a set of players, a set of moves available to the players, and determining the benefit of each combination of policies
 adhikansh 'kooparative game' vishesh function form main nirupit kiye jate hai, jabaki ekstensive or normal form kaa prayog noncooparative gemon ko paribhaashit karne main hota he
 Extensive forms can be used to 'formalize' games with some important sequences
 isamen game aksar 'treez' ke rup main nirupit kiye jate hai yahaan prayek vartex ek khilaadi ke liye vikalp kii ek bindu darshata he
 The player is specified by a number listed by 'vertex'
 vartex se baahar nikali rekhaaen us khilaadi ke ek sambhavya kriya ko darshaati hai
 The benefits are specified at the bottom of the tree
 yahaan chitrit game main do khilaadi dikhaae gaye hai
 Player 1 first moves and chooses either f or U
 khilaadi 2 khilaadi 1kii chaal ko dekhtaa he or phir yaa to a yaa r chunata he 
 Suppose player 1 chooses u and then player 2 chooses A, then player 1 gets 8 and player 2 gets
 ekstensive form, vaise game jinamein donon chaalen ek saath nahin chali jaatin or aise game jiname jaankaree pakki nahin hoti, in do prakaar ke gemon kii bhi vyakhya kar saktaa he
 To represent this, different vertexes — to show them part of the same information set — are either joined by a dotted line, or a closed line is drawn between them
 normal aamtaur par ek metrics ke dwaara nirupit kiya jaataa he jisamen khilaadi, chaalen or laabh ankit rahete hai 
 Generally this can be represented by a function that is associated with the benefit of all combinations of moves of each player
 saath main die gaye udhaaharan main do khilaadi hai; ek ro kaa chayan karata he or doosraa kollam kaa
 prayek khilaadi ke paas do ranneetiyaan hai jo ro or cholemon kii sankhya ke dwaara nirdisht kii gayi hai
 The benefits are given inside
 pehali sankhya ro vaale khilaadi ko praapt laabh he; duusari sankhya kollam vaale khilaadi ko praapt laabh he
 Suppose if player 1 moves up, player 2 moves left
 tab khilaadi 1 ko 4 laabh praapt hota he or khilaadi 2 ko 3 praapt hota he
 When a game is presented in normal form, it is assumed that each player plays simultaneously or is at least ignorant of the other's moves
 yadi khilaadiyon ko ek duusare ke vikalpon kii koi jaankaree hoti he to game ko aam taur par ekstensive form main prastut kiya jaataa he
 'cooperative' games with transferable utility do not offer any independent distinct benefits
 iske bajaay, kairactaristic function prayek gathbandhan ke liye laabh nirdhaarit karata he
 The standard assumption is that the empty alliance gains 0
 is form kaa praarambhik strot won neumann or morganstern kii aadharbhoot pustak se praapt hota he
 While studying coital normal form games, he assumed that when an alliance formed c { \ displaystyle C} C, it played against complementary coalitions as if they were playing a 2-player game
 c { \ displaystyle C} c kaa samyavastha laabh kairactaristic hota he
 Now there are different models for extracting coefficient values from normal form games, but not all games of characteristic form can be derived from normal form games
 niyamanusaar, ek kairactaristic function form game ek peyar { \ displaystyle } ke rup main nirupit kiya jaataa he jahaan n { \ displaystyle N} khilaadiyon ke ek set ko vyakt karata he or v : 2 n ⟶ r { \ displaystyle v:2^{n} \ longrightarrow \ mathbb {R} } ek kairactaristic function hota he
 The characteristic function form is generalized in games with no transferable utility routing
 kairactaristic function form 'coalishan' ke gathan ke sambhavya 'externalitiz' ko nazarandaz kar detaa he
 In partition function form, the benefit of 'coalition' depends not only on its members but also on how the other players are divided
 game theory kaa prayog maanav or pashu ke vividh vyavhaaron ke vistrut adhyayan main kiya gaya he
 It was initially developed in economics to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including the behavior of companies, markets, and consumption theory
 saamaajik vigyaan main game theory kaa upyog or vistrut hua he or game theory raajnneetik, saamaajik or manovaigyanik vyavhaaron ke adhyayan main bhi prayukt hua he
 Game theory-based analysis was initially used by Ronald Fisher in the 1930s to study animal behavior
 yah kaam "game theory" ke naam ke aastitiv main aane se pehle kaa he, lekin isaki or game theory kii kai visheshtaayen samaan hai
 Its development in economics was later used in biology by John Menard Smith in his book Evolution and the Theory of Games
 vyavhaar ke anumaan or vyakhya ke alaava game theory kaa prayog naitik yaa maanak vyavhaar ke siddhanton ko viksit karne ke prayaas main bhi kiya gaya he
 In economics and philosophy , scholars have also used game theory to understand good or appropriate behavior
 agar ham peeche jaaen to dekh sakate he ki game theory aadhaarit is prakaar ke bhavarth ko plato ne bhi prastut kiya tha
 The use of game theory in political science focuses on the overlapping areas of fair division,]]]
 in kshetron main se prayek main, shodhakartaaon ne game theory aadhaarit modelon ko viksit kiya he jinamein khilaadi aksar matadaata, rajya, special interest group or raajnneetijna hote hai
 For early examples of game theory used in political science, see the work of Anthony Downs
 apni pustak ain iconomik theory of demokrasisaanchaa:harvard citations / core main unhone 'hoteling form lokation model'ko raajnneetik pranali main prayukt kiya he
 In the Downsian model, political candidates are committed to principles in a one-dimensional policy 'space'

 Economists have long been using game theory to analyze a wide range of economic facts, including auctions, bargains, duopoly, equitable division, oligopolies, the construction of social networks, and voting mechanisms
 yah anusandhan saamanytah ranneetiyon ke vishisht samucchyon par kendrit hota he, jinhen khelon main santulan kehete hai
 These "solution concepts" are generally based on the requirements of the rules of rationality
 gaiyr-sahakaari khelon main, naish santulan inamen se sabase prasiddh he
 If a set of strategies represents the best response to other strategies, it is Nash equilibrium
 isaliye yadi sabhi khilaadi apni chaalen naish santulan main chal rahe hai, to unke bich path se hatane ke liye koi ekatarfa pralobhan nahin hoga, chunki unki ranneeti sarvshereshth he, atah ve vah kar sakate hai, jo anya khilaadi kar rahe hon
 The profits of the game are usually taken to represent the individual game theory utility of the players
 adarsh sthitiyon main munaafaa aksar dhan kaa pratinidhitiv karata he, jo sambhawatah kisi vyakti kii upyogita se sambandhit hota he
 However this assumption may be flawed
 arthshaastra main game theory par ek pratimanaatmak shodhpatr kisi aise khel kii prastuti ke dwaara prarambh hota he, jo kisi vishisht aarthik sthiti kaa sankshepan ho
 One or more solution concepts are chosen, and the author demonstrates which set of strategies are appropriately balanced in the presented game
 swaabhaavik rup se hamen yah aashcharya ho saktaa he ki is jaankaree kaa kya upyog kiya jaae
 Economists and business professors suggest two primary uses: descriptive and prescriptive
 pehla gyaat upyog is baat ko varnit karnaa he ki maanav aabaadi kis prakaar kaa vyavhaar karti he
 Some scholars believe that by discovering game equilibria, they can predict how the actual human population will behave when confronted with situations similar to those described in the game being studied
 game theory kaa yah vishisht drushtikon naveenatam aalochana kaa saamana kar rahaa he
 First, it is criticized for noting that the assumptions made by game theorists are often violated
 game theoricar yah maan sakate hai ki khilaadi apni vijayon ko pratyaksh rup se adhiktam str tak badhaane ke liye sadaiv ek hi prakaar se kaary karte hai, lekin vyavhaarik taur par, maanav swabhaav aksar is model se bhinn hota he
 There are many interpretations of this fact: irrationality, new models of deliberation, or even various motivators
 pratyuttar main game theoricar apni dharanaon kii tulana bhautik-shaastra main prayukt dharanaon ke saath karte hai
 Thus although their assumptions do not always prove true, they can use game theory as a scientific ideal similar to the patterns used by physicists
 haalaanki is game theory ke prayog par kuch atirikt aalochana bhi laadi jaati he kyonki kuch adhyayanon ne yah pradarshit kiya he ki vyakti santulan ranneetiyon kaa prayog nahin karte
 For example in the game of centipede, 2 / 3 of an average game is based on guessing and in dictator games people do not play regularly with Nash equilibria
 in adhyayanon ke mahatv ke sandarbh main bahes jari he
 Alternatively, some authors claim that Nash equilibria do not provide predictions for human populations, but rather explain why populations playing with Nash equilibria remain in that state
 haalaanki yah sawaal fir bhi khulaa rahata he ki aabaadiyaan us bindu tak kaise pahunchatin hai
 Some theorists have turned to evolutionary game theory to address their concerns
 ye pratimaan yaa to khilaadiyon ke liye koi taarkikta nahin maanate yaa paribaddh taarkikta maanate hai
 Despite its name, evolutionary game theory does not necessarily consider natural selection in a biological sense
 vikasvaadi game theory jaivik or saath hi saanskrithik vikaas tathaa vyaktigem theory shiksha ke pratimaan donon ko shaamil karata he
 On the other hand, some scholars view game theory not as a predictive tool for the behavior of humans, but as a suggestion of how people should behave
 chunki kisi khel kaa ek naish santulan anya khilaadiyon kii game theory vidhiyon ke prati vyakti kii sarvshereshth pratikriya kaa nirmaan karata he, atah aisi chaal chalanaa upyukt prathit hota he, jo naish santulan kaa ek bhaag ho
 However, this experiment has also come under criticism for game theory
 sabase pehle, kuch maamalon main gaiyr-santulan ranneeti kaa prayog karnaa tab upyukt hota he, jab vyakti ko anya khilaadiyon dwaara bhi ek gaiyr-santulan ranneeti kaa prayog karne kii ummid ho
 For an example, see 2 / 3 estimate of average
 doosraa, qaidi kaa asamanjas ek anya sambhavit prati-udhaaharan prastut karata he
 Confused by the prisoner, each player trying to fulfill their selfishness brings both players in a bad situation, in which they would have stayed if they had not tried to fulfill their selfishness
 arthshaastra ke vipareet, jeevigyaan main khelon ke liye laabh kii vyakhya aksar yogyata ke sambandh main kii jaati he
 In addition, less attention has been focused on the balance of the idea of rationality and more on the equilibria that can be maintained by the evolutionary forces
 jeevigyaan main gyaat sarvshereshth santulan ko vikasvaadi sthir ranneeti ke rup main janaa jaataa he or ise sabase pehle main prastut kiya gaya tha
 Although its initial motivation did not include any mental requirement of Nash equilibrium, each ESS is a Nash equilibrium
 jeev vigyaan main game theory kaa upyog anek bhinn tathyon ko samajhane main kiya gaya he
 It was first used to explain the origin of the 1: 1 sex ratio
 ne yah suzav diya ki 1:1 ling anupaat un vyaktiyon par kaary kar rahi vikasvaadi shaktiyon kaa parinaam he, jinhen apane pautron kii sankhya ko adhiktam str tak badhaane kaa prayaas karne waalon ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he
 Additionally, biologists have used evolutionary game theory and ESS to explain the emergence of communication between animals
 sanket khelon or anya sampreshan khelon ke vishleshan ne pashuon ke bich sampreshan kii utpatti kii kuch jaankaree pradaan kii he
 For example, in many species of animals, in which a large number of predatory animals attack a large predator, the behavior of mass invasion appears to be an example of spontaneous organization
 kshetreeyata or ladaai ke vyavhaar kaa vishleshan karne ke liye jeev-vigyaniyon ne chuzon ke khel kaa prayog kiya he
 In a preface to the origins and theory of games, Maynard Smith writes, "incidentally, it has been found that game theory applies more to biology than to the field of economical behavior for which it was originally designed
 "
 vikasvaadi game theory kaa prayog prakruti main asangem theory prathit hone vaale anek tathyon kii vyakhya karne ke liye kiya jaataa rahaa he
 One such fact is called biological altruism
 yah ek aisi sthiti he, jisamen ek jeev aisi paddati se kaary karata hua dikhaai detaa he, jo anya jeevon ke liye laabhadaayak or swayan uske liye ahitkar hoti he
 This differs from the traditional notion of altruism, because such actions are not conscious, but appear as evolutionary adaptations to increase gross worthiness
 iske udhaaharan pishaach chamagaadadon, jo raat ke shikaar se hasil kiye gayi khun ko ugalkar apane samooh ke un sadasyon ko de dete hai, jo shikaar kar paane main asafal rahe hon, se lekar karmi madhumakhiyon, jo aaajeevan rani madhumakhi kii seva karti hai or kabhi milan nahin karatin, se lekar varvet bandaron, jo samooh ke sadasyon ko shikari ke aagaman kii chetavanee dete hai, bhale hi isse unka swayan kaa jivan khatare main pad jaye, tak main paye ja sakate hai
 All of these tasks increase a group's overall worth, but an organism has to lose its life to do so
 vikasvaadi game theory is paropkaarita kii vyakhya sambandhiyon ke chayan ke vichaar ke rup main karata he
 The philanthropists make distinctions between the beings they help and they favor their relatives
 hamiltan kaa niyam is chayan ke peeche vikasvaadi tark kii vyakhya sutara c<b*r ke dwaara karata he, jahaan paropkaaree ko laganevaali laagem theory praptakarta ko milanevaale laabh va sambhddhata ke gunank ke gunanfal se kam honi chaiye
 The greater the proximity between the two organisms, the greater the incidence of altruism as they will have many of the same genetic elements
 iskaa arth yah he ki paropkaaree jeev, is baat ko sunishchit karte hue ki uske nikat sambandhiyon ke genetic tatv aage prasaarit hote hai,, swayan kii santan ko janm dene ke vikalp kaa tyaag kar saktaa he kyonki samaan sankhya main genetic tatv aage prasaarit hue hai
 For example, the coefficient of support for a sibling is 1 / 2 because the organism shares 1 / 2 genetic element in its sibling's offspring
 is baat ko sunishchit kar lenaa ki kisi sahodar kii santanon kii paryaapt sankhya vayask hone tak jivit rahati he, paropkaaree vyakti ke liye swayan kii santan utpann karne kii aavashyaktaa ko samaapt kar detaa he
 The coefficient values are highly dependent on the scope of the playground: for example, if the selection of those to be favored includes all genetic living objects, not just relatives, we assume that the difference between all humans is the playground
 Contains about 1% of the variation, the coefficient that was 1 / 2 in a small area becomes 0
995
 isi prakaar yadi is par vichaar kiya jaye ki genetic swaroop kii kisi soochna ke atirikt koi anya soochna samay ke saath bani rahati he, to khel kaa maidan or bada va bhed-bhav chote ho jate hai
 Game theory is beginning to play an increasingly important role in logic and computer science
 anek taarkik siddhanton kaa aadhaar khel arthvigyaan main he
 In addition, computer scientists have used games to construct many interactive calculations
 saath hi, game theory bahu-abhikarta tantron ke kshetra kaa ek saidhantik aadhaar pradaan karata he
 Separately, game theory has also played a role in the online algorithm
 vishishtatah, k-sarwar samasya, jiskaa ullekh ateet main chal-laagem theory vaale khel or nivedan-uttar khel ke rup main kiya jaataa tha
 Template: Harvard citations / core Yao's theory is a game-theoretic technique to prove the lower limits of the computational complexity of randomized algorithms, and in particular online algorithms
 elgorithmik game theory kaa kshetra jatilta or elgorithm kii rachana kii computer vigyaan kii avadharanaon ko game theory or aarthik siddhant ke saath sanyojit karata he
 The emergence of the Internet has led to the development of algorithms for exploring games, markets, calculative auctions, peer-to-peer mechanisms, and balances in the security and information markets
 darshanashastra main game theory ke anek upyog hai
 In response to two papers presented by Harvard citations / core, Lewis used game theory to develop a philosophical understanding of the conference
 aisa karte hue, unhone saamaanya gyaan kaa praarambhik vishleshan pradaan kiya or taal-mail sambandhi khelon main khel ke vishleshan ke liye iskaa prayog kiya
 Additionally, he first suggested that one could understand meaning in the context of hint games
 louis ke baad anek darshanikon dwaara is suzav kaa prayog kiya gaya he ,saanchaa:harvard citations / core)
 sammelnon ke khel-saidhantik Lewis ke baad, ulman margelit or bicheri ne saamaajik niyamon ke aise siddhant viksit kiye hai, jo unhen ek mishrit-uddeshy vaale khel ko ek taal-mail sambandhi khel main roopantarit karne ke parinamswaroop praapt hone vaale naish santulanon ke rup main paribhaashit karte hai
 Game theory also challenges philosophers to think in terms of interactive metaphysics: what similar beliefs or knowledge means to a group, and what effect this knowledge has on the social consequences of agents' interactions
 is kshetra main kaary karne vaale darshanikon main bicheri, skirms, tathaa stallnekar shaamil hai
 In ethics, some authors have attempted to follow the project of selfishness, initiated by Thomas Hobbes
 chunki qaidi kaa asamanjas naitikta or swaarth ke bich ek abhaasiya sangharsh ko prastut karata he, atah is baat kii vyakhya karnaa is pariyojna kaa ek mahatvapurn ghatak he ki swaarth ke liye sahakaarita kii aavashyaktaa kyon hoti he
 This general strategy is a component of the general social contract approach in political philosophy and see Kavka)
 anya lekhakon ne naitikta ke prati maanviya drushtikon ke udbhav tathaa is sambandh main pashuon ke vyavhaaron kii vyakhya karne ke liye vikasvaadi game theory kaa prayog karne kaa prayaas kiya he
 These authors view various games including prisoner's dilemma, reindeer hunting, and Nash bargaining games as providing explanations for the emergence of an ethics approach
 game theory ke kuch bhaagon main prayukt kuch purvanumaanon ko darshanashastra main chunauti di gai he; manovaigyanik ahambhaav kahata he ki taarkikta swaarth ko kam karti he-ek daawa, jo darshanikon ke liye bahes kaa vishay he
 a game is cooperative if players are able to make binding commitments
 udhaaharan ke liye kanoonee tantra unke liye apane vachanon kaa paalan karnaa aavashyak banaata he
 This is not possible in non-cooperative games
 aksar aisa mana jaataa he ki sahakaari khelon main khilaadiyon ke bich samvaad kii anumati di jaati he, lekin gaiyr-sahakaari khelon main nahin
 This classification is rejected on the basis of two binary criteria
 khel ke do prakaaron main se, gaiyr-sahakaari khel sarvshereshth vivaranon tak paristhitiyon ke pradarshan main sakasham hote hai or sateek parinaam utpann karte hai
 Cooperative games are widely focused on sports
 in do margon ko jodne ke lakshaneey prayaas kiye gayi hai
 The so-called Nash-program has already established many cooperative conditions as non-cooperative equilibria
 sankarit khelon main sahakaari va gaiyr-sahakaari tatv hote hai
 For example, in cooperative games, players' alliances are formed, but they play in a non-cooperative style
 ek samamit khel aisa khel hota he, jisamen kisi vishisht ranneeti ke anusaar khilne kaa laabh keval anya prayukt ranneetiyon par nirbhar karata he, na ki unhen khelanewaalon par
 If the identity of the players can be changed without changing the profits from the strategies, the game is symmetrical
 saamanytah adhyayan kiye jane vaale 2 × 2 khelon main se anek samamit hote hai
 Chicken, prisoner's dilemma, and stag hunting prey are all symmetrical games
 kuch vidwaan in khelon ke udaahranon ke rup main vibhinn asamamit khelon par vichaar kar sakate hai
 However the most prevalent benefits for each of these games are symmetric
 sarvaadhik adhyayan kiye jane vaale asamamit khel ve khel hote hai, jinamein donon khilaadiyon ke liye ranneetiyon ke samaan samucchy nahin hote
 For example, Ultimate Game and Dictator Game have different strategies for each player
 haalaanki, yah bhi sambhav he ki kisi khel main donon khilaadiyon ke liye ek samaan ranneetiyaan hon or fir bhi vah asamamit ho
 For example, the game depicted on the right is asymmetric despite having the same set of strategies for both players
 shunya-raashi khel sthir-raashi khelon ke vishesh udhaaharan hai, jinamein khilaadiyon dwaara kiye gayi chayan uplabdh sansadhano ko na to badhaate hai or na hi ghataate hai
 In zero-sum games, for each combination of strategies, the sum of the total profits of all players in the game is zero
 pokar kaa khel ek shunya-raashi khel kaa udhaaharan prastut karata he kyonki koi bhi khilaadi thik utani hi raqam jeetta he, jitani uske pratidwandvi haarate hai
 Other zero-sum games include coin matching and most classical board games including Go and Chess
 game theorycaron dwaara jin khelon kaa adhyayan kiya gaya he, unamem se adhikansh gaiyr-shunya-raashi khel hai kyonki unamem se kuch praptiyon ke sakal parinaam shunya se zyaada yaa kam hote hai
 Informally, in non-zero-sum games, the gain of one player is not necessarily associated with the loss of another player
 sthir-raashi khel chori or jue jaisi game theory vidhiyon se sambandhit hote hai, lekin us moolbhoot aarthik paristhiti se nahin, jisamen vyapaar se laabh sambhavit hote hai
 It is possible to convert any game into a zero-sum game by adding an additional fake player, whose losses compensate the player's net profit
 samakalik khel aise khel hote hai, jinamein donon khilaadi apni chaal ek saath chalate hai, yaa yadi ve ek saath chaal nahin chalate, to baad vaale khilaadi pehle khilne vaale khilaadiyon kii chaal se anbhigya hote hai 
 Sequential games are games in which players playing later have some knowledge of the preceding moves
 yah aavashyak rup se purvavarti khilaadiyon kii prayek game theory vidhi kii purna jaankaree nahin hoti; yah bahut thodi jaankaree ho sakati he
 For example, it is possible that a player knows that a preceding player did not perform a specific move, while he does not know which of the other moves the first player had made, among other available moves
 samakalik or aanukramik khelon main mukhya antar upar charchit vibhinn pradarshnon main sammilit kiye gayi hai
 Often, the general form is used to represent synchronized games and the broad form is used to represent sequential games; However, technically this is not a strict rule
 aanukramik khelon kaa ek mahatvapurn up-samucchy purna jaankaree se milakar bana hota he
 a game is full of information if all players are aware of the moves previously made by other players
 is prakaar, keval aanukramik khel hi purna jaankaree vaale ho sakate hai kyonki samakalik khelon main prayek khilaadi anya khilaadiyon kii chaalon ko nahin jaanata
 Most games studied in game theory are incomplete-information games, however, some interesting examples of full-information games, including the Ultimate Game and the Shatapada Game, are available
 purna-jaankaree vaale khelon main shatranj, go, mankala or arima shaamil hai
 Complete information is often understood as all information, which is a similar concept
 samast jaankaree ke liye prayek khilaadi ko anya khilaadiyon kii ranneetiyon va praptiyon kii jaankaree hona aavashyak he, lekin unki game theory vidhiyon kii jaankaree hona aavashyak nahin he
 Games studied by economists and real-world players generally end up with a limited number of moves
 shuddh ganitagya utane baadhya nahin hote or samucchy siddhantkaar vishishtatah un khelon kaa adhyayan karte hai, jo chaalon kii aseemit sankhya tak jari rahete hai or unamem vijeta un sabhi chaalon kii samaapti ke baad tak gyaat nahin hota
 Generally, the focus is not on what is the best method to play such games, but only on whether a player has a winning strategy
 
 The existence of such strategies has important implications in descriptive set theory for skillfully designed games
 game theory kaa adhikansh bhaag simit, asatat khelon se sambandhit hota he, jinamein khilaadiyon, chaalon, ghatnaon, parinaamon aadi kii sankhya simit hoti he
 However many concepts can be extended
 satat khel apane khilaadiyon ko ek satat ranneeti samucchy main se kisi ranneeti kaa chayan karne kii anumati dete hai
 For example, the cornet competition is typically designed in such a way that players' strategies are any non-negative quantities, including fractional quantities
 antareey khel, jaise continyus percyut and evejan khel satat khel hai
 Individual game theory decision problems are sometimes considered "one-player games"
 haalaanki ye sthitiyaan khel saidhantik nahin hai, lekin unki rachana nirnay siddhant ke niyamon ke antargem theory unheen upkarnon main se anek kaa prayog karke kii jaati he
 Only when two or more players have a problem does the game become theoretical
 aksar betaratib bhang se khilne vaala koi khilaadi joda jaataa he, jo "avasarwaadi chaalen" chalata he, jinhen "swaabhaavik chaalon" ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he
 In a two-player game, this player is not considered a third player, but instead plays a role of dice where necessary in the game
 khilaadiyon kii aseemit sankhya vaale khelon ko aksar n-vyakti khel kaha jaataa he
 These are the games that have to be developed to develop rules for any other game, goal or subject game

 No general game theoretic analysis was followed until Antony Augustine Cornut published the Recherches sur les principes mathématiques de la théorie des richesses in 1838
 is kaary main cornt ne ek dwayadhikaar par vichaar kiya he or ek samaadhaan prastut kiya he, jo naish santulan kaa ek simit sanskaran he
 Although Cornett's analysis is more general than Waldegrave's analysis, game theory had virtually no existence as a unique field before John von Neumann published a series of papers in 1928
 haalaanki francisi ganitagya emily borol ne khelon par kuch praarambhik kaary kiya, lekin won newman ko game theory kaa avishkaarak hone kaa shrey uchit rup se diya ja saktaa he
 Von Neumann was an intelligent mathematician whose work spread widely from aggregation theory to his calculations, which were the key to the development of both molecules and hydrogen bombs, and ultimately to the task of developing computers

 In 1950, the prisoner's confusion appeared and an experiment was carried out on the game at RAND Corporation
 isi samay ke aas-paas, jon naish ne khilaadiyon kii ranneetiyon kii paraspar sangem theory ta ke liye ek maapdand viksit kiya, jise naish santulan ke rup main janaa jaataa he or jo won newman or morgenstem dwaara prastaavit maapdand kii tulana main khelon kii ek vyapak shrenee par lagu hota he
 This equilibrium is sufficiently general that it allows analysis of non-cooperative games in addition to cooperative games

 Additionally, it was during this time that game theory was first applied in philosophy and political science

 In this sense, it is the fourteenth largest city in the United States by area
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles 
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 Nevertheless, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from the Valdivia earthquake in 1960
 The city is located in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 ° C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 ° f warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 °F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 °F, with overnight lows of 63 °F 
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 °F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 °F and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 ° f and 73 ° f in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 ° f in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 ° f in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 ° f on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 ° f on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical coral tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the bird of paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions
