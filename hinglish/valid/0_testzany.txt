 a nuclear weapon or nuclear bomb is an explosive device whose base of destructive power is nuclear reaction
 yah nabhikeey sanlayan yaa nabhikeey vikhandan yaa in dono prakaar kii nabhikeey abhicriyon ke sammilan se banaaye ja sakate hai
 Both types of reaction result in huge amount of energy from very few materials
 aaj kaa ek hajaar kilo se thodaa bada nabhikeey hathiyaar itani urja utpann kar saktaa he jitani kai arab kilo ke paramparaagat visphotakon se hi utpann ho sakati he
 Nuclear weapons are known as destructive weapons
 dwitiya vishwayuddh main sabase adhik shaktishaalee visphotak, jo prayukt hua tha, uskaa naam 'blockbster' tha
 In its construction, 11 tons of the most widely known explosive trinitrotoluene was used till then
 is visphotak se 2000 guna adhik shaktishaalee pratham parmaanu bam tha jiskaa visphot tii
 en
 tii
 ke 22,000 ton ke visphot ke baraabar tha
 Now more powerful atomic bombs have been made than the first atomic bomb
 parmaanu bam main visphutit hone vaala padaarth uranium yaa plutonium hota he
 Power is achieved only by nuclear fission of uranium or plutonium
 iske liye parmaanu ke cendrak main neutron se prahaar kiya jaataa he
 a very large amount of energy is obtained from this stroke
 is prakram ko bhautik vigyaani nabhikeey vikhandan kehete hai
 Neutrons are free from the neutrons in the interior of the atom's nucleus
 ye neutron anya parmaanuon par prahaar karte hai or unase phir vikhandan hota he
 They then fission other atoms
 is prakaar shrunkhlaa kriyaayein aarambh hoti hai
 The uncontrolled series of atomic bombs result in the explosion of the atom with great intensity
 uranium ke kai samasthanik gyaat hai
 Normal uranium contains 99
3 percent U-238 and 0
7 percent U-235
 you-238 kaa vikhandan utani saralata se nahin hota jitani saralata se you-235 kaa vikhandan hota he
 U-235 has three neutrons less than U-238
 neutron kii is kami ke kaaran hi you-235 kaa vikhandan saralata se hota he
 Other fissile materials used in atomic bombs are U-233 and plutonium-239
 parmaanu visphot ke liye vikhandaneey padaarth kii kranthik sanhati aavashyak hoti he
 Critical code is the minimum amount of current for a chain action
 yadi vikhandaneey padaarth kii maatra kranthik sanhati se kam he to neutron keval dhurradhurr karata rahegaa
 Increasing the volume slowly will create a time when at least one free neutron strikes a new atom and breaks it down
 aisi sthiti pahunchne par vikhandan kriya swat: chalane lagati he
 The volume of the Revolutionary Code is confidential
 jo raashtra parmaanu bam banaate he ve hi jaanate hai or dusron ko batalaate nahin
 If the critical code of the U-235 is 20 pounds, then the series action will not start by taking ten to ten pounds two
 20 pound ko ek saath lene se hi shrunkhlaakriya chaalu hogi
 The number of neutrons in the chain increases very quickly
 parmaanu bam main vikhandan se uranium or use nikatavarti anya padaarthon kaa taap badi shighrata se upar uthta he
 Metallic uranium transforms into incandescent gas at high pressure and temperature
 visphotak pind kaa taap 10,00,00,000° se
 tak uth jaataa he
 At such a high temperature, the uranium plate is removed
 tab sara pind badi prachandta se visphutit hota he
 Atomic bombs erupt and produce half-waves that propagate around at speeds greater than the speed of sound
 jab parmaanu bam ko prithvital ke upar visphutit kiya jaataa he to tarangen prithvital se takaraakar upar uthati hai or nayaa aghat utpann karti hai jo upar or neeche tivrata se failata he
 The center of the bomb blast immediately warms and produces vacuum
 nirvaat bharne ke liye aasapaas kii thandi hawaayen daudti he
 In this way they are broken by atomic bombs hitting homes
 visphoti uranium anya tatwon main badal jaataa he, usase radio actevedhi kirane nikalakar jivit koshikaon ko aakraant kar unhen nasht kar detii hai
 The destructive function of the bomb is due to shock waves, piercing rays and excessive heat production
 hydrogen bam parmanubam kaa ek kism he
 a hydrogen bomb or H-bomb is a more powerful atomic bomb
 isamen hydrogen ke samasthanik du tirium or tritirium kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 Fusion of atoms causes the bomb to explode

 ve kisi tapasvi kii bhanti ann-jal kaa tyaag kar lambe samay tak tapasya main leen rahe sakate the
 Such austerities could have been done so that Indrasana would be shaken
 ek baar unke darbar main ek saadhaaran si veshbhusha vaale ek yuvak ko pakadakar unke sainik laae
 He was going somewhere in suspicious condition at night with lots of money
 uski veshbhusha se nahin lag rahaa tha ki is dhan kaa vah maalik hoga, isliye sipaahiyon ko laga shaayad vah chor ho or chori ke dhan ke saath kahin chanpat hone kii firaaq main ho
 When the king asked the young man to introduce him and wanted to know how this money came to him, the young man told that he is a servant to a wealthy woman and all the money has been given by that woman
 ab raja kii jigyaasa bad gai or unhone jaananaa chaha ki us stri ne use yah dhan kyon diya or vah dhan lekar kahan ja rahaa tha
 On this, the young man said that the woman had asked to wait in some place
 darasal us stri ke usase aniatik sambandh hai or vah usase pati kii hatya karke aakar milanevaali thi
 Both would go far with all the money and lead a comfortable life
 vikram ne uski baton kii satyata kii jaanch karne ke liye turant uske bataaye pate par apane sipaahiyon ko bheja
 The soldiers came and reported that the woman had received information about the arrest of her servant
 ab vah vilaap karke kah rahi he ki luteron ne sara dhan lut liya or uske pati kii hatya karke bhaag gaye
 She has taken care of her husband and is planning to become Sati to prove herself to be a husband
 subah yuvak ko saath lekar sipaahiyon ke saath vikram us stri ke ghar pahunche to drishy dekhakar sachmuch chaunk gaye
 The woman had sat on her husband's funeral pyre and Chita was about to catch fire
 raja ne chita ko agni dene vaale ko roak diya tathaa us stri se chita se utarane ko kaha
 He showed all the money to him and brought the servant forward and said that he had come to know the truth
 unhone us stri ko triya charitra kaa tyaag karne ko kaha tathaa rajdand bhugatne ko taiyaar ho jane kii ajna di
 The woman was frightened for a few moments, but at another moment said that the king should check the character of his younger queen before fingering her character
 itnaa kahkar vah bijli si furti se chita par kudi or usamen aag lagaakar sati ho gai
 The woman was burnt to ashes while doing something
 raja sipaahiyon sahit apane mahal waapas laut gaye
 The last words of that woman were still burning them
 unhone choti rani par nigaah rakhni shuru kar di
 One night, thinking of them sleeping, the little queen woke up and exited the palace through the back door
 raja bhi dabe paanv uskaa peechha karne lage
 Later, she went to a monk fuming some distance
 sadhu ne use dekha to uth gaya or use lekar paas bani ek kutiyaa ke andar donon chale gaye
 What Vikram saw in the hut was unbearable for him
 rani nirvastr hokar us sadhu kaa aalingan karne lagi tathaa donon pati-patni kii tarah bejhijak sambhogarat ho gaye
 The king thought that he loved the younger queen so much, yet she was unfaithful
 unka krodh seemaa paar kar gaya or unhone kutiyaa main ghuskar us sadhu tathaa choti rani ko maut ke ghat utaar diya
 When he returned to the palace, his mental peace was gone
 ve hameshaa baichaiyn tathaa khinn rahane lage
 His mind was uplifted by worldly pleasures and a feeling of quietness was born in his mind
 unhen lagata tha ki unke dharm-karm main zaroor koi kami thi jiske kaaran bhagwaan ne unhen choti rani ke vishwasghaat kaa drishy dikhaakar dandit kiya
 Thinking all this, he handed over the weight of the coronation to his ministers and went to do penance on the beach himself
 samudr tat par pahunchakar unhone sabase pehle ek pair par khadey hokar samudr devtaa kaa aahvaan kiya
 Pleased with his practice, when the sea god appeared to him, he requested the sea god to fulfill a small demand
 unhone kaha ki unke tat par ve ek kutiyaa banaakar akhand sadhana karnaa chaahate hai or apni sadhana nirvighn puraa karne kaa unase aashirwad chaahate hai
 The sea god gave him his blessing and provided him a conch
 samudr devtaa ne kaha ki jab bhi koi divine vipatti aegi is shankh kii dhwani se dur ho jayega
 Taking a gift from Samudra Dev, Vikram thanked him and bowed and returned to the beach
 unhone samudr tat par ek kutiyaa banaai or sadhana karne lage
 He practiced so hard for a long time that there was a stir in Dev Lok
 saare devtaa baat karne lage ki agar vikram isi prakaar sadhana main leen rahe to indra ke singhaasana par adhikaar kar lenge
 Indre could see his throne in jeopardy
 unhone apane sahyogiyon ko sadhana sthal ke paas itani adhik vrishti karne kaa aadesh diya ki puraa sthaan jalmagn ho jaae or vikram kutiyaa sahit pani main bah jaaen
 The order just needed to come
 bahut bhayanak vrishti shuru ho gai
 In just a few hours, the entire place would have been submerged and Vikram would have been immersed in the water including the hut
 lekin samudr dev ne unhen aashirwad jo diya tha
 He drank all the water of that rain and the place of worship remained as dry as before
 indra ne jab yah adbhut chamatkaar dekha to unki chintaa or bad gai
 He called his servants and ordered them to resort to the storm
 itane bhayanak veg se aandhi chali ki kutiyaa tinke-tinke hokar bikhar gai
 Everything started flying like cotton in the air
 bade-bade vriksh ukhdakar girane lage
 Vikram's feet also appeared to be uprooted
 laga ki aandhi unhen udaakar sadhana sthal se bahut dur phenk degi
 Vikram remembered the conch shell given by Samudra Dev and he burnt the conch aloud
 shankh se badi teevr dhwani nikali
 No storm and storm with conch sound were detected
 vahaan aisi shaanti chaa gai maano kabhi aandhi ai hi na ho
 Now the concern of Indra Dev has increased even more
 unhen sujh nahin rahaa tha ki vikram kii sadhana kaise bhang kii jaae
 Now only the attraction of Apsaras could disturb Vikram's practice
 unhone tilottama naamak apsara ko bulaayaa tathaa use jaakar vikram kii sadhana bhang karne ko kaha
 Tilottama was Anupam Sundari and seeing its form, no one could live without being injured by the deeds of Cupid
 tilottama sadhana sthal par utari tathaa manamohak gayan-vaadan or nrity dwaara vikram kii sadhana main vighn daalane kii cheshtaa karne lagi
 But what could the recluse do to Vikram? vikram ne shankh ko phunk maari or tilottama ko aisa laga jaise kisi ne use aag kii jwaala main laa pataka ho
 She emerged from the terrible heat and disappeared from there at that moment
 jab yah yukti bhi kargar nahin hui to indra kaa aatmavishvaas puri tarah dol gaya
 He disguised himself as a Brahmin and visited cultivation sites
 ve jaanate the ki vikram yaachakon ko kabhi niraash nahin karte hai tathaa samarthyanusaar daan dete hai
 When they reached Indra Vikram, Vikram asked the purpose of his arrival
 unhone vikram se bhiksha dene ko kaha tathaa bhiksha ke rup main unki kathin sadhana kaa sara fal maang liya
 Vikram happily donated all the fruits of his work to him
 sadhana fal daan kya tha- indra ko abhaydaan mil gaya
 He praised and blessed Vikram's greatness
 unhone kaha ki vikram ke rajya main ativrishti or anaavrishti nahin hogi
 There will be no famine or drought
 All crops will be full on time
 itnaa kahkar indra antarvaryaan ho gaye

 Using this definition, one can derive conic as a mathematical equation in any coordinate method

 The shape of the curve obtained from the plane and perpendicular circular cone depends on how the plane cuts the cone

 They gave him two daughters Poonamdeep and Swapnandeep, but what he knew was that luck would take him to a Pakistani jail
 28 agast 1990 ko uski jindagi kaa sabase manahuus din tha
 He drunkenly entered the Pakistan border, because then there were no wire enclosures and a Pakistani colonel held him for seven days, then presented him in court
 adaalat main use manjit singh ke naam se pesh kiya gaya, kyonki isi naam se unke khilaaf exiaar darj kiya gaya
 He was also accused of spying for India
 yaheen se unki dard bhari kahani shuru hui
 The painful story of Sarabjit Singh, a resident of Bhikhiwind village in Tarn Taran district of Punjab starts from 28 August 1990
 isi din sharaab ke nashe main sarbajit singh seemaa paar gaye chale gaye jahaan unhen pakistani sena ne giraftaar kiya tha
 Describing Sarabjit Singh as an agent of RAW, he was accused in the Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad bombings
 baad main oktober 1991 main unhen faansee kii sajaa sunai gai
 In favor of Sarabjit Singh, along with his family, human rights organizations also came to light when it was found that the Government of Pakistan had committed many frauds in Sarabjit's case
 pakistan kii adaalat main jo passport pesh kiya gaya tha us par naam likhaa tha khushi mohammad kaa lekin tasviir sarbajit singh kii lagaai gai thi
 Similarly in 2005, Pakistani released a video claiming that Sarabjit Singh had confessed to his crime, but till 2005 Pakistan used to call Sarabjit Singh as Manjeet Singh
 2005 main hi wo gavaah media ke saamne aayaa jisane sarbajit kii pahchaan kii thi, usne media se saaf kaha ki us par dabaav daalkar sarbajit ke khilaaf bayaan dilvaaya gaya tha
 But despite these frauds, the date of hanging of Sarabjit was fixed on April 1, 2008, although his hanging was postponed indefinitely after diplomatic efforts
 june 2012 main pakistani media main khabar aadi ki sarbajit ko reeha kiya ja rahaa he lekin yah khabar afvaah sabit hui
 darasal pakistan sarkaar ne sarbajit ke badale surajeet singh< kii rihaai kaa aadesh diya tha
 Since then, there has been hope among the people of India that Sarabjit Singh will be released and return one day, but the news of his death finally came
 26 april ko lahore ke kot lakhapat jail main unpar jo hamalaa hua wo jaanaleva sabit hua
 Sarabjit Singh, an Indian prisoner in Pakistan's Kot Lakhpat Jail, had told about the bad behavior of his fellow prisoners in the year 2010 itself
 lekin iske baavjood jail prashasan ne uski suraksha par koi kadam nahin uthaae
 He wrote a poignant letter in this regard to his lawyer Awais Sheikh
 patr main usne apni aapbeetee bayaan kii thi
 He wrote that Pakistan's government institutions were bent on making him Manjit Singh out of Sarabjit Singh, while he himself did not know about Manjit Singh and did not know what he had done in Pakistan
 usne likhaa tha, "jail kaa staff or police or yahaan tak ki jail main band kaidi bhi mujhe hikaarat bhari najaron se dekhte the
 They considered me a blast
 " sarbajit ne pakistani vakil avais shaikh kaa dhanyavad dete hue likhaa ki unhone asli manjit singh ko dhund nikaala tha
 When Manjit Singh was captured by Sarabjit, then the real Manjit Singh was traveling to England and Canada
 lekin baad main vah pakadaa gaya
 According to Sarabjit's family, he became a victim of mistaken identity after wandering from his border village in Pakistan
 usne likhaa tha, “jail kaa staff or police or yahaan tak ki jail main band kaidi bhi mujhe hikaarat bhari najaron se dekhte the
 They considered me a blast
 pakistan main galati se daakhil ho gaya tha
 But i think I'll be missing soon
 maine koi jurm nahin kiya tha, sirf border hi to paar kiya tha
 " sarbajit ke parivaar waalon kaa kahana he ki wo ek nirdosh kisaan the or unako bhul se koi or samajhakar pakad liya gaya he
 After this Sarabjit Singh kept on knocking at the doors of different courts of Pakistan, but the High Court and Supreme Court also upheld the sentence of the lower court
 ek samachar patr ke anusaar bollywood gayak mika singh ne vaayada kiya he ki sarbajit kii beti kaa vivaah wo apane paison se karenge
 Sarabjit's Pakistani lawyer Owais Sheikh appealed to reopen the case by presenting all the evidence gathered against the real accused Manjit Singh
 vakil ovais sheikh ne court main daawa kiya ki unka muvakkil sarbajit begunaah he or wo manajit singh ke kiye kii sajaa kaat rahaa he
 Owais Sheikh said that Sarabjit has been charged with the Karachi bomb blasts in may-june in 1990, whereas in reality in the FIR lodged on July 27, 1990, Manjeet Singh has been accused of these blasts
 26 april 2013 ko taqariban dopaher ke 4
30 baje central jail, lahore main kuch kaidiyon ne into, lohe kii salaakhon or rod se sarbajit singh par hamalaa kar diya tha
 Later, he was admitted to Jinnah Hospital, Lahore in a critical condition, at that time he had also gone into a coma and his reed had also broken
 phir bhi hospital main unhen ventilator par rakhaa gaya tha
 But how many attacks were made on them and why were they done? The Pakistan government refused to say
 Sarabjit's sister believed that the attack on her had already been planned
 unki patni, bahan or 2 betiyon ko unhen hospital main dekhne kii izaazat di gayi thi
 On 29 April 2013, India also requested Pakistan to release Sarabjit Singh, but this appeal of India was rejected by the Government of Pakistan
 Sarabjit's lawyer also appealed for the release of Sarabjit in the Pakistan court, but they too failed and the Government of Pakistan sent Sarabjit to the UK instead of sending him to India for medical examination
 1 may 2013 ko jinnah hospital ke doctoro ne sarbajit singh ko branded ghoshit kiya lekin pakistani adhikario ne ise maanane se inkaar kar diya
 or unki bahan or unke parivaar ko bhi bharat vaapis bhej diya gaya
 lekin bharat aane ke baad unki bahan ne daawa kiya kii doctor imaanadaaree se unke bhai kaa ilaaj nahi karte the
 unki bahan kaa aisa kahana he kii unhone unke bhai ke anguuthe par syaahi kaa nishaan dekha tha or jab unhone doctoro se is vishay main poocha tha to unhone iskaa jawaab dene se inkaar kar diya tha
 On 2 May 2013, he died in Lahore at 12

 Later, his body was sent to India and in the post-mortem, the Indian doctors told that the main parts of his body were removed

 It is written in only one manuscript, this manuscript is also known as Novel Codex
 isaki rachana ek anaam anglo-sexon kavi dwaara 8veen or aarambhik 11veen sadi ke bich kii gai thi
 In the poem, Beowulf is the protagonist of Gates, who battles with three enemies: Grendel, who attacks the resident warriors in the mead hall of Harugar, Grendel's mother and an unnamed dragon
 antim ladaai baad main hoti he, biovulf ab gates kaa raja ban chukaa he
 In the final battle, Beowulf is severely wounded
 uske dehanth ke baad uske samarthak use getland ke tumulas main dafna dete hai
 The events described in the poem date back to the late 5th and early 7th centuries, after the anglo-saxons settled in England, when the Saxons either immigrated to Scandinavia and northern Germany, or their European partner Kinsmen Were close kavita ko get mul ke logon dwaara england main sancharit kiya gaya ho saktaa he
 It is said that Beowulf was first composed in Randalsham, East Anglia in the 7th century, as Sutton Hoo also had close contacts in Scandinavia as well as descendants of the Wolfing of the former Anglian royal dynasty, the Waffings, Gate
 duusare is kavita ko raja eloard kii adaalat, yaa raja canute kii adaalat se sambandhit maanate hai
 The poem is based on mythology, that is, it was designed for entertainment and does not separate fictional events from actual historical events, such as the raid by King Hygelac on Frisia
 516
 Scholars generally believe that many of Beowulf's personalities are also available in Scandinavian sources, but this is not only related to the people, but also to the gharanas and some events

 Archaeological evidence from the 19th century can confirm the Beowulf story

 When excavated on the mound of Edgils in 1874, objects found during that time supported Beowulf and his stories

 Beowulf is known as a mythological epic, whose protagonist is a protagonist, who travels long distances to fight monsters and animals, full of divine powers
 kavita bhi medias res, yaa saamaanya rup se dekhen to "madhya main" shuru hoti he he, jo pracheen mahakavyon kii visheshta he
 Although the poem begins with the arrival of Beowulf, Grendel's attacks continue for some time
 kavi jisane biovulf kii rachana kii he, kahani bataate samay main, kahani ke bheetar utsaah or saahas banaae rakhane ke liye ek nishchit style kaa upyog karne par dhyaan diya he
 The detailed history of the characters and their dynasty, as well as their interactions with each other, the essence of their actions, the deeds of their valor, etc
 are best described
 jine chance ne apane 1980 aalekh "da starkachral unity of biovulf: da problem of grandles madar" main likhaa he ki kavita do maanak vyakhaaen karti he: pehla paksh do-bhaag vaali sanrachana kaa suzav detaa he or doosraa paksh, teen-bhaagon vaali sanrachana kaa suzav detaa he 
 Chance stated that, "the two-part structure favored the generality of the proceedings of the British Academy 22 after its introduction in JRR Tolkien Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics"
 On the contrary, she argues that the three-part structure is "more popular"
 biovulf kii shuruyaat raja harugar kii kahani se hoti he, jisane apane logon ke liye mahaan haul hioroot kaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 In it, his wife Velhapio and his warriors spend time celebrating by dancing, until an out-of-society gruesome Grendel attacks the hall and kills many of Harugar's warriors at bedtime and She devours them
 lekin grandal ke paas harugar ke singhaasana ko chune kii himmat nahin hoti he, kyonki use yah bataaya gaya he ki harugar kii suraksha k shaktishaalee devtaa karte hai
 Harugar and his men, thinking helplessly against Grendel's attacks, abandon Heorot
 getland kaa yuva yoddha biovulf, harugar kii dasha ke bare main pataa chalate hi, apane raja kii anumati lekar apni mathrubhumi ko chhodkar harugar kii sahaayta karne nikal padataa he
 Beowulf and his soldiers spend the night in Heorot
 jab ve sone lagate hai, tab grandal haul main pravesh karti he or hamalaa bol detii he or biovulf ke ek aadmi kaa bhakshan karne lagati he
 Beowulf, who had no weapon, which was an unfair advantage over the unarmed beast, was acting gold and Grendel leaped and held him in his hand
 donon ghamaashaan yuddh karne lagate hai
 Beowulf's followers attack with their swords, but their weapons also do not deter Grendel's hair
 antat, biovulf grandal ke sharir se uskaa haath uske kandhe se tod daalata he or grandal ansu nikal aate hai or maranasann avasthaa main apane ghar kii ore bhaag jaataa he
 The next night, after celebrating Grendel's death, Harugar and his men go to sleep in Heorot

 She kills Harugar's most loyal warrior, Ascher, in revenge for Grendel's death
 harugar, biovulf or unke sainik grandal kii maa ko jhil ke andar uski khoh main dhundh lete hai
 Beowulf prepares himself for battle, Unforth the warrior, giving him a sword
 harugar ko uske maranoparant karne ke liye kai sthitiyon ke liye pratigna dilaane ke baad, biovulf jhil main kud jaataa he
 Grendel's mother soon sees him and attacks him
 haalanki, vah apane hathiyaar ke madhyam se biovulf ko nuksaan pahunchaa nahin paati he, isliye use jhil ke nichle sataha tak khinch kar le jaati he
 Grendel's body and the corpses of the two men are kept in the cave, with fierce fighting between Grendel's mother and Beowulf
 sabase pehle, grandal kii maa prabal prathit hoti he
 Beowulf, unable to harm his enemy with his haunting, enrages him, it enrages him
 biovulf phir se apane kavach ke kaaran apane dushman ke hamale se batch jaataa he, yaa he or grandal kii maa ke haathon ko apane talwaar se aahat kar detaa he, biovulf uskaa sir dhad se alag kar detaa he
 Going further into the lair, Beowulf finds Grendel's corpse, he cuts off his head and keeps it with him
 biovulf phir sataha par or apane saathiyon ke paas "nau ghanto" ke baad waapas laut aata he
 He goes to Heorot, where Hroगरgar gives Beowulf many gifts, including his family's inherited nagging sword
 biovulf ghar waapas aa jaataa he or baad main apane hi logon kaa raja ban jaataa he
 One day, sometime in Beowulf's life, a slave steals a gold cup from an unidentified dragon's den in Ahernaness

 Beowulf and his warriors go on to fight the dragons, but when Beowulf is wounded by the dragon's blows, all his warriors run away in fear
 keval ek yoddha, ek bahadur yuva vigulf, biovulf kii madad karne ke liye rukta he
 The two together kill the dragons, but Beowulf dies from his wounds
 dah sanskaar ke baad, biovulf ko samudr ke paas ek chattan main dafna diya jaataa he, jahaan samudri navik uske tumulas ko dekh sakate hai
 Dragon's treasure is distributed along with Beowulf's will to distribute it among the people
 vahaan us dher ke saath abhishaap judaa he
 It is widely accepted that Beowulf's three funerals were performed
 ye shavyatraaen kavita kii kahani kii ruparekha main parivartan karne or saath hi sansaarik sampatti, yuddh or yash par darshakon ke vichaar parivartit karne main madad karti hai
 The funerals are also associated with the three wars described above
 teenon shavyatraaen prayek antim sanskaar ke vivaran ke madhyam se vishay main parivartan ke samaan prastaav saajha karte hai
 Gail owen-crocker argues in his book The Four Funerals in Beowulf, known as the poem's Lay of the Last Survivor ", which is an additional funeral
 shavyatraaen swayan ko sanchay karne kii rasm: dharmik or saamaajik-aarthik kaaryon donon ke saath tyaag kii vastuon ke sakshya shaamil karti he
 The first funeral in the poem is called Scyld Sefing, King of the Danes
 pehla bhaag kavi kii madad hrothgar ke vansh kaa parichay karaate hue kavita ke settings kii vyakhya karne main karata he
 The funeral procession introduces a confrontation with the protagonist Beowulf and the first demon Grendel
 yah ansh "kai janajatiyon ke abhishaap, sharaab ke takht ke vidhvansak" ke rup main scield kii mahima ke varnan ke saath shuru hota he
 Scyld's glory and importance are reflected by his distinguished death, which he received while serving as King of Dens
 unke mahatv ko ekbar phir logon dwaara nikaali gai uski bhavy shavyatra sabit karti he: uske antim sanskaar main pradarshit kai hathiyaar or khajaane uske mahaan yoddha or mahaan netaa hone kaa pramaan he
 The poet introduces the heroic society through Scyld
 aise vastuon ke mahatv ko raja kii sampatti ke saath dafan karke varnit kiya gaya he
 The importance of these earthly possessions has since been used to establish the greatness of this dead king in relation to the treasury
 scield kaa antim sanskaar kavi kii madad nyaayik samaaj ke yuddh main veerta or sansaarik sampatti kaise kisi vyakti ke mahatv ko paribhaashit karti he, yah bataane main karata he
 This funeral helps the poet develop the plot of the plot between the antagonist, Beowulf and the main demon Grendel
 kavita main antim sanskaar doosraa yah he ki parijan Hildeburg kii he or kavita FITT ke is duusare number par he
 The funeral is sung in Heorot to celebrate Beowulf's victory over Grendel
 yah grandal kii maa khilaaf ladaai main nayak kii jeet kaa pratik bhi he
 Hildeburg's brother, son and husband were killed in the war
 ladaai main scield kii bhi maut ho gaye thi or yah mrit ke antim sanskaar main upyog kii gaye asaadhaaran sampatti kii gaatha bhi he
 Like the King of the Danes, Hildeburg's relatives were also buried with their weapons and gold to show their importance
 haalanki, rishtedaaron kii shavyatra utani bhavy nahin thi, vah keval antim sanskaar samaaroh hi tha
 In addition, the poet has also depicted the feelings of those who died in the war
 "pighalate sir, khule gahar ghaav


 or sharir se nikalate hue rakt" jaise bheeshan vivaran yuddh ko vir-gaatha ke bajaay ek dardanaak or bhayaavah durghatana ke rup main varnit karte hai
 Although the poet has tried his best to give importance to the subject of property more than death, yet the glory of war challenges the tendency of vicious war
 duusari shavyatra pehali se bhinn avadharana pradarshit karti he or kahani kii disha main parivartan biovulf ke grandal kii maa ke khilaaf ladaai ko netritv karti he
 "lay of the Last Survivor" is logically in addition to Beowulf's three other funerals due to the similarities set to the significance of the other buried people
 is ansh kii teen anya shavyatraaon ke saath pahchaan karne vaali samanthaayen dafnane kii rasmon, setting or bhoomika main parivartan or vishay main parivartan ke samaan he
 Mourning appears to be a funeral procession as burial proposals contain descriptions of the last survivor, which is also found in the funeral processions of Scyld Seifing, Hildeburg's family, and Beowulf
 antim uttarajive mrit logon dwaara chode gaye kai khajaanon ke bare main bataata he jaise hathiyaar, astr or swarna cap, jinke scield ke "behtareen chamkile cap


, kun se sane hathiyaar or kavach," hildebrg ke parijanon ke "kun se sane kavach or boar ke aakaar ke helmet" or biovulf ke dregon kii khoj ke saath kaaphi samanthaayen hai
 This excerpt is also known as the embalming hawk swift horse "
 yah ek jaanavar kii peshkash he jo ki kavita ke yug ke dauraan dafan karne kii ek rasm thi
 In addition, this passage, like other funerals, specifies changes in setting and role
 log yah bhi kehete hai ki kavita ke tisare bhaag main biovulf or dragon ke bich hue antim yuddh ke dauraan vyateet kiye gaye samay kaa varnan karata he
 The poet describes the deaths in the war as frightening, furthering the concept of the second part of the poem through the eyes of the last survivor
 kavita main varnit chauthi shavyatra hi biovulf kii asal shavyatra he
 After the final war against the dragons, Beowulf suffers a fatal wound and dies
 biovulf ke jivan kii mahanata ko uski shavyatra main varnit kiya gaya he, visheshkar uske logon kii kai shradhanjaliyon ke madhyam se
 iske alaava, dregon ke vishaal khajaane ko nayak ke saath dafan kar diya gaya
 The poet also attached more importance to Beowulf's description of the funeral than others
 unke netaa ke antim sanskaar ke liye, "viyohston kaa putr kai logon ke saamne yah ghoshnaa karata he ki ve chita se dur rahen
" dregon ke avasheshon ko scield kii kabr ke samaantar samudr main phenk diya jaataa he
 The funeral of Beowulf is the fourth part of the poem, a tribute to the hero who was "gracious and fair, kind to the people and sensitive to victory"
 biovulf pandulipi kaa pehla gyaat maalik 16veen sadi kaa vidwaan laurence nowell he, jiske naam par pandulipi kaa naam rakhaa gaya he, haalanki iskaa adhikarik pad coton vitaleus e

 Kevin Kierman argues that Nowell received it from William Cecil, the first Baron Burghley, in 1563, when Nowell went to Cecil's house as his son, Edward de Verve, 17th Earl of Oxford teacher
 1731 main coton librari ke eshbernan house main aag lag jane kii vajah se yah kshatigrast ho gaya tha
 Since then, many letters of part of the manuscript have been erased
 athak prayaason se, haalanki pandulipi ke adhiktar hisson ko bachaa liya gaya, phir bhi kavita ke kaaphi shabd nasht ho chuke the
 Kevin Kearman, professor of English at the University of Kentucky, used fiber optic backlighting to retrieve letters of poetry, for computer digitization and preservation of the manuscript
 kavita apane ekal pandulipi ke liye gyaat he, jisaki anumaanit tithi 1000 i
 ke kareeb he
 Kiermen argued after testing the manuscript that it was the author's own copy, which he worked on
 usne is kaary ko canute da great ke yug kaa bataaya
 The poem is available today in Beowulf Manuscript or Novel Codex, among other works
 francesus junius dwaara 1628 or 1650 ke bich nowell kodex ke pehle parnan kaa sandarbh sabase pehle diya gaya tha
 Who owned the codex before Nowell remains a mystery
 reverent thomas smith or hamphre vaanale ne coton librari kii namavali banane kaa kaary apane haathon main liya, jahaan nowell kodex ko rakhaa gaya tha
 Smith's catalog appeared in 1696 and Humphrey's in 1705
 a letter to the Beowulf manuscript was first mentioned in 1700 under the name of Georg Hiches, Wanley's assistant and Wanley
 vaanale ko likhe ek patr main, hikes ne vaanale dwaara banaae gaye, smith ke khilaaf spasht aarope lagaaya ki smith coton emes
 vitelius e

 Hickes replied to Wanley "I haven't found anything related to Beowulf yet"
 It was stated that Smith failed to mention the Beowulf manuscript because it relied on previous nomenclature or did not know how to describe it or it was temporarily removed from the codex
 mul biovulf pandulipi ko do lipikon dwaara pratilekith kiya gaya: lipic e or lipic bi, jinke patr ko pankti 1939 main rakhaa gaya he
 The handwriting of both clerks is not found at all

 Both clerks have corrected their work and Clerk b has also corrected the work of clerical A

 The transcription appears to have been written from books of knowledge kept in the library of Malmesbury Abbey and available as source works, and from some specific words of the local dialect found in the text
 haalanki, kam se kam ek sadi ke liye, kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana tha ki biovulf main grandal ke paatr kaa varnan bliculing homilies ke homili 16 main narak par saint paul ke vichaar se liya gaya tha
 Icelandic scholar Grimmer Johnson Throcklein, working under the Danish Government's Historical Research Commission, first transcribed the manuscript in 1786 and published it in 1815
 ek ko unhone khud pratilekith kiya or doosraa anglo-sexon nahin jaanane vaale peshewar pratilekhakon se karavaaya
 us samay ke baad se, pandulipi ko kai baar todaa maroda gaya, phir bhi throkaleen kaa pratilekhan biovulf vidwaanon ke liye ek bahumoolya madhyamik strot bana hua he
 These transcripts can be attributed to around 2000 papers

 haalanki iskaa lekhak agyaat he, lekin iske vishay or vishay saamagree ke mul anglon-sexon parampara main nihit or scoops dwaara jote gaye europea vir kavitaaon se milte hai
 There are differing views on whether the poem is composed in sync with its transcription, or that the poem was composed in an earlier period and has been transmitted orally for many years
 ne mahasoos kiya ki pandulipi pradarshan ke pratilekhan ko prastut karte hai, haalanki sambhawatah ek baithak se adhik par liye gaye honge
 Kieran has argued on the basis of paleographical and codicological evidence that the poem is contemporary with the manuscript
 keayrnan kaa tark atyadhik charchit kavita ke rajnatik prasang ke bhaag se mail khaataa he: adhikansh vidwaanon nen bhi haal hi main kaha he ki kavita 8veen sadi main likhi gai thi or iskaa anumaan unhone is aadhaar par lagaaya he ki kavita main dens ke liye atyadhik sahanubhuti dikhaai gai he or iske 9veen or 10veen sadi main viking ke yug ke dauraan anglo-sexon dwaara likhe jane kii koi sambhaavna nahin he
 Kiernan's arguments are against the origins of the 8th century, since it also requires that the poem be transcribed in the Viking era by the anglo-saxon, paleographical and codicological evidence that promotes the belief that Beowulf is an 11th-century composite
 There is a poem and it is said that a and Clerk b were writers and Clerk b was more poignant of the two

 Tolkien's conviction that the poem was written in the 8th century is supported by Tom Shippy
 jon mishael kimbali dwaara diya gaya suzav or jaiching kaa bachaav kam se kam aarambhik 9veen sadi ke finnasbarg prakaran ek terminus post quem saamne laata he
 Kimbly identified the character of Hawke's son, Hanaf, with Hnobi, the son of the historical almighty Nobleman Höchting, and worked on an earlier issue based on Frisia as early as 800 AD

 The question of whether Beowulf has ever indulged in any oral tradition before his current manuscript is a matter of debate for centuries and includes many more questions than how it was produced
 balki, yah maukhik-sutrit sanrachana or maukhik parampara ke siddhant kaa aashay detaa he, prashn yah he ki kavita ko kaise samajha jaae or kis prakaar kii vyakhya kii aavashyaktaa he
 The scholarly discussion on Beowulf in the context of oral tradition was highly active in the 1960s and 1970s
 bahes ko is prakaar dekha ja saktaa he: ek ore, ham kavita kaa nayak se sambandhit kai kahaniyaan ko ekasaath laakar anumaan laga sakate hai
 These pieces will be kept for many years due to tradition and it will be imparted apprenticeship to the poets of the coming generations
 The poem is written orally without any preparation and is a traditional epigraphy, attracting oral, pagan, German, heroic and tribal people
 duusari ore, kuch log maanate hai ki yah kavita kisi sakshar lipic dwaara likhi gai he, jo latin sikhte-sikhte sakshar hua tha, sambhawatah koi bhikshu yaa gahare drushtikon vaala isai ho saktaa he
 On this side, pagan references would be some method of ornamental epigraphy
 tisare vichaar ke anusaar upar ullekith donon bahes sahi hai or yah unhen jodne kaa ek prayaas he, isliye inhen paraspar virdohi ke rup main vyakt nahin kiya ja saktaa; iske anusaar kavita ke kaary main ek se adhik isai or ek se adhik butaparast kii bhaavana, jo ki kai sau varshon se ek duusare se alag ho chuke hai, kii jhalak maujuud he; iskaa kahana he ki kavita multah ek sakshar isai lekhak dwaara likhi gai he, jise butaparasti kaa gyaan tha or ho saktaa he ki uske purvaj butaparast rahe hon or usne apana dharm badal liya ho, ek aisa kavi jo maukhik or sakshar lipic donon main paarangat tha or jo maukhik parampara kii kavita kaa "punarnirmaan" karne main sakasham tha; is aarambhik isai kavi ne nyaay ke liye apana balidaan dene kii ichha or zaruratmandon kii sahaayta or suraksha karne ke prayaason or mahanatam suraksha ko apni ankho se dekha tha; achche butaparast vyaktiyon ko sahi raste kaa chunaav karte hue dekha tha or isliye is kavi ne dhairya or sammaan ke saath butaparast samskruti ko prastut kiya tha; phir bhi is praarambhik isai kavi kii rachana or bahut baad main rachiyata "fire-and-brimestone", ek isai kavi jo butaparast abhyaas ko andhere or paap kii sangya detaa he or jisane iske daanvon ke shaitani pahaluon ko joda he
 M
 H
 Abrams and Stephen Greenblatt introduce Beowulf in the Norton anthology of English literature, stating that, "the poet revived the pagan world of Virgatha's language, style and ancient European oral poetry
 It was widely Beowulf is believed to be the creation of a single poet who was a Christian and his poetry reflects the Christian tradition
 haalanki, crown di
ke
 jaise vidwaan kaa kahana he ki kavita padhanevaale se padhanevaale tak maukhik-sutrit rachana ke siddhant dwaara pahunchaaya gaya tha, jo bataata he ki mahakavy kavitaayen unhen padhanevaalon dwaara samay-samay par behatar kii jaati hai
 In his historical work, the proverbial singer, Albert refers to the works of Lord Francis P
 Mogon and others, stating that "the documentation is complete, documented, and accurate"
 This complete analysis is sufficient to prove that Beowulf's composition was oral
 biovulf or anya anglo-sexon kavita kii maukhik-sutrit rachana ke liye kii gai pariksha ke mishrit parinaam hai
 While "themes" exist in anglo-saxon and other European works, some scholars argue that poems are composed on a word-by-word basis and following many formulas and methodologies
 laire benson ne tark diya he ki biovulf kii vyakhya ek sampurna sutrit kaary ke rup main karne se pathak kii kshamta iskaa vishleshan karne main nasht ho jaati he ki kavita ekikrut rup main likhi gai he or ve kavi kii rachanaatmakataa par dhyaan kendrit nahin kar pate hai
 Instead, he proposed that other passages in German literature contain "elements of tradition" from which Beowulf is quoted and elaborated
 kuch saal baad, enn wats ne ek pustak prakashit kii, jisamen unhone anglo-sexon kavita ke liye paaramparik, homer, maukhik-sutrit siddhant ko apurna bataaya he
 He has also argued that the two traditions cannot be compared and therefore should not be done
 thomas gardenar wats se sahamat the, chaar varsh pehle prakashit hue samachaarpatr main unhone tark diya tha ki biovulf paath vividh pravriti kaa he or iskaa nirmaan purna rup se sutron or vishyon dwaara he
 John Miles Foley has specifically stated in the context of the Beowulf debate that, while comparative work is both necessary and valid, it must be organized with the particularities of the given traditions; Foley argued that, given the development of oral traditional theory, do not over-estimate or depend on unverified conjecture about composition, and focus on oral / written assumptions on composition in favor of the traditional and unconstrained text
 Do it antat, ursula skifer ke vichaar main, kavita "maukhik" yaa "likhit" thi, yah sawaal kuch-kuch red hering kii tarah ho jaataa he
 In this model, the poem is composed and is interpretable within both mental horizons
 skifer kii "maukhik" avadharana na to kisi samjhaute or na hi vichaaron ke sanyog ko prastaavit karti he jo kavita ko ek ore europea, butaparast or maukhik maanate hai or duusari ore use latin se uddhrut, isai yaa sakshar maanate hai, lekin jaisaa ki monica otter kaa kahana he: "


 'rupee kaa ek sikaa', maukhik or sakshar donon samskritiyon main milte hai or donon ke hi apane tark or saundarya hai
 " saanchaa:old English topicskaviwa main puraani angreji ke pashchimi sexon or anglian boliyaan mishrit hai, yadhyapi ve pashchimi sexon kii boli adhik he, kyonki usee samay kai anya puraani angrezi kii kavitaaon kii nakal kii gai thi
 The Beowulf manuscript has an astonishing array of linguistic forms
 yahi vah tathy he jo kuch vidwaanon ko yah vishwaas karne ke liye prerit karata he ki biovulf kii lambii or jatil sancharan sabhi mukhya boli ke kshetron ke madhyam main kiya gaya he
 The poem has a complex mixture of the following dialects: Mercian, Northumberian, Early Western Saxon, Cantish, and Last Western Saxon
 Kiernan argues that it is almost impossible that a process of transmission would have occurred at the time by which this complex mixture of generation and generation from clerical to dialect was maintained
 prapatron ke mishran par aadhaarit aarambhik dinaankan ke viruddh keayrnan kaa tark lanbaa he or sammilit he, lekin usne nishkarsh nikaala ki prapatron kaa mishran likhit paath ke tulanaatmak rup se sidhe itihaas ko nimna rup main ingit kiya gaya ho saktaa he: 


 an 11th-century MS, an 11th-century Mercury poet using archaic poetic dialect; And the standard literary dialect of the 11th century which may be early or end, using dialectical-dialect forms and various spellings; And two 11th-century clerks may have written in slightly different spelling methods
 is vichaar ke anusaar, biovulf ko bade paimaane par puratetvik hiton ke utpaada ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he or yah pathakon ko denmark ke bare main 11veen sadi ke anglo-sexon ke bhaavon or uske purv-itihaas, phir bed ke yug or 7veen yaa 8veen sadi ke anglo-sexon kii unke purvajon kii mathrubhumi ke bhaavon ke bare main adhik bataata he
 An Old English poem like Beowulf is very different from a modern poem
 anglo-sexon kavi vishisht anupras chand kaa upyog karte the, jo ki chand kaa ek aisa rup he jisamen anupras kaa upyog kavita kii panktiyon ko ekikrut karne ke liye mukhya sanrachanaatmak upkaran ke rup main kiya jaataa he, anya upkarnon jaise tukbandi ke sthaan par
 yah ek aisi takanic he jisamen pankti ke pehle bhaag ko duusare bhaag se samaan aarambhik dhwani ke madhyam se jod diya jaataa he
 Additionally, the two parts are divided into one Yeti: "off scaled safe \ \ scipina pretum" and the ligature "cg" is pronounced like "dj", as in the word "edge"
 The pronunciation of both f and s varies depending on their phonetic environment
 swar yaa vyanjan ke bich, aadhunik v or z kii tarah sunai dene vaali awaajen hoti hai
 Otherwise they remain silent, such as f in modern "fat" and s in "sat"
 Some letters that are no longer found in modern English, such as thorn, þ and eth, ð — both represent the pronunciation of modern English "th" in "cloth" and "clothe" —are used in the original manuscript and modern English versions
 Has been widely used in
 in varnon kii aawaaj f or s kii tarah pratidhwani hai
 Both are vowels and are between other vowel sounds: oðer, laþleas, suþern
 Otherwise they are dissatisfied: þunor, suð, soþfæst
 biovulf main caning bhi ek mahatvapurn takanic he
 They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often constructed to meet the needs of alliteration in verse
 udhaaharan ke liye, ek kavi samudr ko "swaan-road" kah saktaa he yaa yaa phir "whale-road"; ek raja ko "ring-giver" kaha ja saktaa he
 Beowulf has many kennings and the instrument is a typical classic poem in Old English, with many formulas
 kavita main swar kaa lop karne vaale rupakalankar kaa vyapak upyog bhi kiya jaataa he
 JRR Tolkien argues that the poem is an elegy
