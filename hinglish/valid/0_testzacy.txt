 There have been more than 10,000 organ transplants in China annually for the last 15 years
 Organ donation is not a practice in China
 So where do these organs come from? Amazingly, the waiting period for organ transplant in China is very short - only a few weeks
 Whereas in other countries it takes years to get a favorable organ

 It has come to light through independent investigation that the Chinese government, with the connivance of government hospitals, is involved in the crime of illegal human organ transplantation of prisoners
 Falun Gong practitioners imprisoned in China are the main victims of crime against this humanity
 Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners have been killed in this inhuman act
 Their organs like kidney, liver, cornea, lungs etc
 are removed and sold at a high price for illegal human organ transplant
 Distracted by these news, former Canadian state secretary and human rights lawyer David Matus began research on the subject
 He released his 140-page report in 2006, in the conclusion of which these allegations were confirmed
 According to the Kilgour and Matas report, between 150,000 and 200,000 organ transplants were performed in China between 2000 and 2005, the source of which is unknown

 Governments of Australia, Taiwan, Spain, Israel and Italy banned tourism for organ transplants in China for their citizens
 The US Congress passed an order by Bill H

 krantikari badlaav yaa roopantaran thomas kuhn dwaara unki prabhaavshaalee pustak da strecchar of scientific revolutionas main prayukt pad he jo unhone vigyaan ke prabhavi siddhant ke bheetar mul manyataon main parivartan ko vyakt karne ke liye prayukt kiya tha
 This is different from his idea of general science
 tab se krantikari badlaav shabd ghatnaon ke mul adarsh ke rup main parivartan ke rup main maanviya anubhav ke anya kai bhaagon main bhi vyapak rup se prayog kiya jane laga he, haalanki swayan kuhn ne is pad ke prayog ko kathin vigyaanon tak hi simit rakhaa he
 According to Kuhn, "revolution is something that only members of the scientific society share
 " 
 saamaanya vaigyanik ke vipareet kuhn ne kaha, "vigyanetar vishyon ke vidhyaarthee ke sammukh hameshaa in samasyaon ke anek pratispardhi or athulaneey hal hote hai, aise hal jinpar use swayan apane liye antat vichaar karnaa chahie
" 
 ek baar krantikari parivartan puraa ho jaay to koi vaigyanik, udhaaharan ke liye, is sambhaavna ko tathy ke rup main sweekaar nahin kar saktaa ki rog miasma ke kaaran hota he yaa ether se prakaash hota he
 In contrast, critics of scientific disciplines may use an array of postures, which may be more or less fashionable in a given period, but all of them are considered legitimate

 gyanavaadeey krantikari badlaav ko gyaan-paddati shastri or itihaaskaar thomas kuhn ne apni pustak, da strecchar of scientific revolutionas main vaigyanik kranti kaa naam diya
 According to Kuhn, the scientific revolution occurs when scientists are confronted with such abnormalities that cannot be explained on the basis of universally accepted transformations to which scientific progress has been made so far
 yah roopantaran, kuhn ke vichaar main keval vartmaan siddhant nahin he balki ek sampurna vaishvik najariya he, jisamen vah va usamen nihit prabhaav maujuud hote hai
 It is based on the characteristics of the landscape of knowledge recognized by scientists around them
 kuhn ne bataaya ki sabhi roopantaranon main asaamanyataayen hoti hai, jinhen sweekaar karne yogya staron kii trutiyon ke rup main chhod diya jaataa he yaa jinase nipatane kii bajaay nazarandaaj kar diya jaataa he
 According to Kuhn, these inequalities have importance at different levels for the scientists of that time
 beesvin sadi ke prarambh ke bhautik shaastra ke sandarbh main kuch vaigyanikon ko mercuri ke perihelion kii gananaa manm micelson-morli prayog ke parinaamon kii tulana main adhik kathinaayee mahasoos hui or kuch ke saath iskaa vipareet hua
 Here and elsewhere, Kuhn's model of scientific change has been differentiated from that of logical positivist models in that it emphasizes individual human beings acting as scientists rather than as mere logical or philosophical ventures
 gives
 "vartmaan roopantaran ke viruddh paryaapt mahatvapurn asaamanyataon ke jamaa ho jane par, vaigyanik anushaasan, kuhn ke anusaar ek sankat kii sthiti main chalaa jaataa he
 In times of crisis, new devices, possibly discarded earlier, are used
 antat naye roopaantar kaa nirmaan hota he, jiske apane nae maanane vaale hote hai or naye va puraane roopantaranon ko maanane waalon ke bich ek bauddhik jang chhid jaati he
 The transition between the Maxwellian electromagnetic worldview and Einstein's view of relativity to early twentieth-century physics was neither transitory nor peaceful, but rather long-drawn attacks from both sides with empirical information and rhetorical or philosophical arguments It was full of history, in which the Einsteinian theory eventually prevailed
 Then, the weight of the evidence and the importance of new information were sifted by human sieve, with some scientists finding the simplicity of Einstein's equations more compelling while others found it more complicated than Maxwell's idea of ether that he abandoned
 kuch logon ko eddington ke surya ke chaaron ore mudate prakaash ke chitra sammohak lage, jabaki kuch ne unki sateekta or arth par prashnchinh lagaae
 kuhn ne maiks plank ke uddhran, "nai vaigyanik sachai kii jeet uske virodhiyon ko santusht karke or unhen samajha kar nahin hoti balki samay ke saath in virodhiyon kii mrityu or is sach ke saath paidaa hui or badi hone vaali nai santati ke kaaran hoti he", kaa prayog karte hue kaha ki kabhi-kabhi in par bharosa laane vaali shakti keval samay or iske dwaara lee jane vaali maanavtaa kii bali hi hoti he
 The conversion of a subject from one conversion to another is called a scientific revolution or revolutionary change in Kuhn's term
 deergh prakriya se utpann is antim parinaam ke liye akasar aam bhashaa main vaigyanik kranti yaa krantikari badlaav pad kaa prayog kiya jaataa he: vaishvik najariye main, kuhn ke aitihaasik tark kii vishistataaon ko dhyaan main rakhe bina, maatr parivartan
 a common misconception of conversions is the belief that the discovery of revolutionary changes and the dynamic nature of science are a matter of relativity: the view that all belief systems are the same, such that magic, religious doctrine, or mythology are as much as real science Have the same functional value
 kuhn is vyakhya kaa joardaar khandan karte hai or kehete hai ki jab kisi vaigyanik roopantaran kaa sthaan koi nayaa roopantaran letaa he, jo haalanki ek jatil saamaajik prakriya he, to bhi nayaa roopantaran keval bhinn hi nahin balki sadaiv behatar hota he
 These claims of relativism are tied to another claim that Kuhn endorses in some way: that the language and principles of different conversions cannot be mutated or judiciously evaluated against one another — that is, they are incomparable
 isse vibhinn logon or samskritiyon ke mul rup se bhinn vaishvik najariyon yaa saidhantik yojanaon par charchaa chali – itane bhinn ki bhale hi ve behatar hon yaa nahin, par ek duusare ke dwaara samajhe nahin ja sakate
 phir bhi, darshanik donald davidson ne 1974 main ek atyant sammanit niabandh, “on da veri idia of a konceptual skim,” prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone yah tark diya ki yah vichaar ki koi bhi bhashaa yaa siddhant ek duusare ke prati athulaneey hai, swayan hi asangat he
 If this is true, Kuhn's claims are far weaker than the assertion
 iske alaava, jatil maanviya bartaav ko samajhane ke liye bahu-roopantaranon vaale tareekon ke vyapak prayog ke kaaran saamaajik vigyaan par kuhneey vishleshan kii pakad kaaphi halki rahi he
 Revolutionary changes are more dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as was physics at the end of the 19th century
 us samay, bhautik shaastra ek adhikanshtah viksit tantra kii antim kuch baton ko puraa karne vaala ek vishay tha
 In 1900, Lord Calvin made the famous statement, "now there is nothing new to be invented in physics
" bas adhik se adhik sateekta se maapne kii hi aavashyaktaa he
 "after five years, Albert Einstein published his research on special ambiguity, which used very simple rules to explain power and speed, created by more than two hundred years of innovative procedures
 Were, challenged
 da strecchar of scientific revolutionas main kuhn ne likhaa, ”kranti ke jariye ek roopantaran se duusare main uttarottar parivartan paripakv vigyaan kaa saamaanya vikaas kaa tarika he
 "kuhn's own idea was revolutionary at the time, because it brought about a major change in the way academics talk about science
 is tarah, yah tark diya ja saktaa he ki usase vigyaan ke itihaas or saamaajik shaastra main ek “krantikari badlaav” hua yaa vah swayan hi iskaa ek hissaa tha
 But Kuhn did not recognize any such revolutionary change
 Being in the social sciences, people still use the initial ideas when discussing the history of science
 kuhn sahit vigyaan ke darshanikon or itihaaskaaron ne antat kuhn ke model ke sanshodhit rup ko sweekaar kiya, jo uske mul vichaar ko uske pehle ke kramiktavaadi model ke saath sanshleshit karata he
 Kuhn's original model is now generally considered very limited
 vigyaan main kuhneey krantikari badlaavon ke kuch “adarsh maamle” hai: According to Kuhn, the only dominating conversion is the virtue of the sciences, while much of the philosophy and social sciences see "a tradition of claims, counter-claims and debates on core principles"
 anya logon ne kuhn ke krantikari badlaav ke siddhant ko saamaajik vigyaan par lagu kiya he
 In the late 1990s, revolutionary change became a fundamental mantra, which became popular in business lore and began appearing in publications and articles multiple times
 lekhak laire trask ne apni pustak, mind da gaphe, main pathakon ko salaah di he ki ve is pad kaa prayog na karen or is vaakya se yukt kuch bhi padhate samay saavdhaan rahen
 anek lekhon or pustakon main arthhin ho jane kii had tak iske kuprayog or atiprayog kaa sandarbh diya gaya he
 The term "revolutionary change" has also been used in many other contexts, in that it represents a major change in a particular ideology - personal beliefs, fundamental changes in complex systems or organizations, including earlier ways of thinking or organization
 The place of thinking or organization of fundamentally different thinking has been used

 Kalaripayattu is a martial art form of India derived from the spelled southern state of Kerala

 kalari payat main hamale, pair se maarna, mallayuddh, purv nirdhaarit tareeke, hathiyaaron ke jakhiren or upachaar ke tareeke shaamil hai
 Its regional forms are classified according to the geographical location of Kerala, the northern style of Malayalio, the southern style of Tamils and the central style from inner Kerala
 The northern Kalari payat is based on the principle of hard technique, while the southern style mainly follows soft techniques, although both systems use internal and external concepts

 Professor Philip Zerrilli of the University of Exeter, one of the few Western experts on the Kalari payet, estimates that the art dates back to at least the 12th century
 itihaaskaar elmkulam kunjan pillai kalari payat ke janm kaa shrey 11 veen shatabdi main cher or chol rajwanshon ke bich lambe samay tak chale yuddh ko dete hai

 hindi granthon ke khojavivarnon me pachaason kosh granthon ke naam milte hai
 Apart from these, in 'poddar Abhinandan Ganth', Shri Jawaharlal Chaturvedi has given the names of 14-15 such words which have not been found in the descriptions
 isse aisa lagata he ki hindi sahitya ke madhyakaal main or uske baad bhi chote-bade saikadon kosh bane the

 Most shells supported 'amarkosh' as their mainstay
 uski upjivyata kaa unhone ullekh bhi kiya he
 Sometimes the name of Amarkosh is also mentioned
 par kuch keshkaron ne medini hemkosh aadi se bhi sahaayta lee he
 The glimpses of the mid-lexicon system can be seen by looking at the names of some of the well-known thesaurus
 'nammala' or 'anekarthmanjari' 'nandadaasan' ke do kosh milte hai
 From the nominal works of these verses created, there is a sense of their form
 'garibadas' kaa 'anangaprabodh' 1615 i0 kii rachana kahin jaati he
 The two words of the word 'ratnajit' (13 AD) have been spoken - Bhasha Bhasha Sindhu and Bhasha Dhatumala
 inke naam bhi swarupaparichaayak he
 'khalikbari' of 'tuhfat ul-hind' Khusro of 'mirza Kha' - is a very famous dictionary; a 'dingle dictionary' has also been created long back
 inke atirikt bhi anek kosh bane
 There is also a dictionary called 'namachintamani' named after 'nandadas'
 'amarkosh' ke bhi sabhawatah anek padyanuwaad hue he
 From the context of these texts, it is known that, as stated above, based on 'amarkesh' and sometimes other dictionaries, medieval phrasal dictionary of Hindi was formed as a synonym or synonym
 dhaatusangrah kaa bhi ek kosh— uparyukt dhatumala —antim varnakramanusaari sankalan he
 Mirzakha's dictionary presents an overview of innovative methods in many respects
 apane dhang kaa yah pratham prayaas kaha gaya he

 Similarly, the english-hindi-persian hair of Lallulal is also notable
 'ekaakshari kosi' oshadhivardanammala' aadi anek prakaar ke shabd sangrahatmak koshon kaa bhi nirmaan hua he
 In addition to the ancient Vergnusari division in the medieval lexicons of Hindi, only the title division is also found, such as 'ath Go word', 'ath like word' etc
 muraridaan ke dingal kosh ke antargat vargapaddati ke saath saath anya sheershak bhi die gaye hai
 In the above dictionary there are title forms - Ath Vanaspatikayamah, Doha, Vannama etc
 isaki ek anya visheshta bhi he—indriyon ke anusaar upasheershak jaise—'ath dbidrianah, tnidrianah chaturindrianah panchedrianah

 The word compilation in the medieval lexicons of Hindi has been mainly based on some of the famous Sanskrit lexicons
 iske atirikt 'bhikhaarodas' aadi ke saahitiyik bhashagranthon se bhi shabd sankalit hue he
 From the time of 'khusrau' and the books affected by them, there is an attempt to collect the words of life or speech
 sanskrit koshon kii paddati bhi— jiske anusaar 'ghansaar- shchandrasanvah' kahkar chandra kii sabhi sangyaaon kon kapur kaa paryaay bhi saketit kar diya gaya he— 'umrao' kosh aadi main milti he
 But, like 'amarkosh' etc
, there was no system of gender instruction in the Hindi dictionary
 shivsingh kysth ke bhashaa amarkosh main spasht hi use bina prayojan samajhakar chhod dene kaa nirdesh kiya gaya he
 Sometimes it has been said in a dictionary that the long form is feminine and the masculine masculine
 avyayon kaa samavesh bhi praayah nahin ke baraabar uplabdh he yadhyapi anek koshon main sanskrit ke parinishthit padrupon ko tatsam bhavase bhi kabhi kabhi nirdishta kiya gaya he tathaapi sanskrit avyayon ke sakalan main yah prakriya chhod di gai he
 As far as specifying the change developed in sounds is concerned - except for the words 'tuhfatulahind', it is lacking otherwise
 'bhikharidas' ne avashya hi ek sthal par ya, ja ri, ri, sha, sha, sa or jna aadi kaa samasyatmak ullekh maatr kar diya he
 The synonyms and various meanings of Nanarth have also been jewel by some lexicographers either at the end with synonyms or information or by giving a number with each synonym
 sakshep main kah sakatai hai ki - Medieval Hindi Kosh mostly composed in verse, which is influenced or translated by Sanskrit lexicons - mainly 'amarkosh'
 adhiktah ye paryaayavachi kosh he
 There are also some non-synonymous shells and two are also found to be monosyllabic
 kuch 'nighantu' granth bhi—jo vaidyak se sambandhit the,— sanskrit se prabhavit hokar bane
 -these collections are more in these dictionaries
 kabhi kabhi dhaatukosh bhi mil jate hai
 For this reason, most of the lexical names have been used more often like 'nammal', 'nammanjari', 'namprakash', 'namchintamani', etc
 — 'aatmbodh' yaa 'analpaprabodh' aadi main paribhaashik—shabdkosh— paddati bhi milti he
 —the endings are mostly base characters in the word
 shabdhvibhaajan yaa to varganusaari he yaa sheershakanusaari
 In 'tuhfatulhid' there is definitely a division of the classes
 kuch koshon main uccharan or varnanupurvi kaa saamaanya nirdesh bhi dikhaai pasta he
 - a collection of verbs with nomados also appears in some dictionaries of Dingle
 —kabhi kabhi paryaayganana bhi he or paribhaashaayen bhi
 Apart from renouncing the elements considered to be redundant, such as gender, etc
, any new thing related to theology, which has special importance in the development of thesaurus
 —in koshon main aavirbhoot nahin hui
 In relation to pronunciation etc
, sometimes the sharp vision of the koshaka must be attracted
 dusro or bhashaa main prayukt honevaale or mahatvapurn sahityakaron ke vishisht sahityagranthon main prayogaagat tadbhav, deshi or videshi shabdon ke sankalan kaa prayaas utana nahin hua jitna hona aavashyak tha
 Medieval Hindi dictionary probably wanted to make Hindi dictionary based on Sanskrit dictionary available before them
 iskaa ek or bhi atyant mahatvapurn evam sambhavit kaaran kaha ja saktaa he
 The most important purpose of the dictionary is to understand the readers of Vadmaya texts
 parantu sanskrit koshon or tadadhaarit hindi koshon ke nimarteon kii mukhya drushti thi aise koshon ke sampadan par jo visheshtah kaviyon ore saamanontah anya granthkaaron ke prayogarth paryaayavachi shabdbhandar ko sulabh bana den
 In Nighantubhashya i
e
 Nirukta, most attention has been given to Vedartha-interpretation
 sanskrit sahitya ke rachanaatyak granthon ke tikaakaron ne arthbodhan ke liye hi kosh vachanon ke uddhran die hai
 Yet, in the view of most Sanskrit lexicons, assisting in the creation of poetry — synonyms were perhaps a very important goal
 Similarly, making words accessible for proper translation in syllables, metaphors, etc
, was the main task of many non-word words — collectors
 
 hindi ke koshaakaari ne bhi sambhavat is prerana ko apana priytar uddeshy samajha
 For this reason, the responsibility of making the corpus of the historical and cultural dictionary accessible to the non-cultural people was also found in the Hindi dictionary
 thode se koshkaron ne aarambh main paryaay yaa anekarth shabdo main nae shabd jode
 But the independent effort to move much further was reduced
 phir bhi kuch koshkaron ne tadbhav aadi shabdon kii thodi bahut vruddhi karne kaa praayas kiya
 Overall, one can say that in the medieval Hindi dictionaries, no element of Koshavidya was progressed
 sanskrit koshon kii pramanik praudhata main usee prakaar kuch hraas hi hua jaise, reetikalin sahityashastra ke hindi-lakshan-granthon main sanskrit ke tadvishyak vishishtagranthon kii paudhata kaa
 The aspect of derivation was completely abandoned in the medieval lexicons of Hidi
 sanskrit koshon main bhi yah paksh upekshit hi rahaa par kosh ke anek tikaakaron ne vyutpatti par dhyaan diya
 In the 'explanation Sudha' or 'ramashrayi' commentary of 'amarkosh' each etymology of 'amarkosh' is given
 hindi ke madhyakalin koshon kii na to waisi tikaayen likhi gai or na tadbhav shabdon kii vyutpatti kaa anushilan hi hua
 Hence, there is no progress in terms of developmental skills of phonology

 The Adigranth is the main scripture of the Sikh sect
 ise 'guru granth sahib' bhi kehete hai
 It was edited by Sri Guru Arjun Dev Ji, the fifth Guru of Sikhism
 guru granth sahib ji kaa pehla prakaash 16 agast 1604 ko harimandir sahib amritsar main hua
 In Damdama Sahib in 1705, Dashmesh's father Guru Govind Singh Ji completed it by adding 116 words of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, totaling 1430 pages
 gurugranth sahib main maatr sikh guruon ke hi upadesh nahin he, varan 30 anya hindu sant or alang dharm ke muslim bhakton kii vaani bhi sammilit he
 While it speaks of Brahmin devotees like Jayadevji and Parmanandji, the representatives of castes considered hay in the erstwhile Hindu society suffering from caste-based self-discrimination, such as Kabir, Ravidas, Namdev, Sain Ji, Saghna Ji, Chhivaji, Dhanna Speeches are also included
 paanchon vakt namaaj padhane main vishwaas rakhane vaale shaikh farid ke shloke bhi guru granth sahib main darj hai
 Guru Granth Sahib is unique in terms of its linguistic expression, philosophical, message
 isaki bhashaa kii saralata, subodhta, sateekta jahaan janamanas ko aakarshith karti he
 At the same time, the use of music notes and 31 ragas has also made the introspective esoteric spiritual teachings sweet and sensual
 guru granth sahib main ullekith darshaniktaa karmwaad ko manyata detii he
 According to Guruvani, a person gets importance only according to his deeds
 samaaj kii mukhya dhara se katkar sanyas main ishwar prapti kaa saadhan dhund rahe saadhakon ko gurugranth sahib sabak detaa he
 Although Guru Granth Sahib recognizes the importance of introspection, meditation, Guruvani opposes abandonment, inaction, inertia in the name of Sadhana
 guuruvaani ke anusaar ishwar ko praapt karne ke liye saamaajik uttardaayitv se vimukh hokar jangalon main bhatakane kii aavashyaktaa nahin he
 God is in our heart, he needs to find and experience in his inner heart
 guuruvaani brahmagyaan se upji atmik shakti ko lokkalyaan ke liye prayog karne kii prerana detii he
 Through sweet behavior and using polite words, every heart has been taught to win
 saanchaa:sandook sikh sampradaay The holy scripture of the Sikhs, which was stored by his fifth Guru Arjun Dev in 1604 AD, and which the Sikh Matanuayi also called 'guru Granth Sahib Ji' and honored as Guruvat
 'aadigranth' ke antargat sikhon ke pratham paanch guruon ke atirikt unke nawein guru or 14 'bhagaton' kii baniyaan aati hai
 Such a collection probably began to be prepared from the time of Guru Nanakdev and Moradhan, son of Guru Amardas, also preserved the letters of the first four gurus, which the fifth guru rearranged from him and some of the 'bhagats' Including the statements of 'bhai Gurudas', everyone got it written in Gurmukhi
 bhai bannon ne phir usee kii pratilipi kar usamen katipay anya logon kii bhi rachanaayen mila deni chaahin jo peeche sweekrut na katipay anya logon kii bhi rachanaayen govindsingh ne uskaa ek teesraa 'bid' taiyaar karaayaa jisamen, navam guru kii kritiyon ke saath-saath, swayan unke bhi ek 'salok' ko sthaan diya gaya
 Its same form is still considered present today
 isaki keval ekaadh antim rachanaaon ke vishay main hi yah kahana kathin he ki ve kab or kis prakaar jod di gai
 The first five compositions of 'granth' are famous by the names of 'japunisanu', 'sodru' Mahla 1, 'sunibra' Mahla 1, 'so Purakhu', Mahla 4 and Sohila Mahla respectively, and their 'sirairag' etc
 are divided into 31 ragas
 Come in which the compositions of the first Sikh Gurus are stored according to them
 inke ananthar bhagaton ke pad rakhe gaye hai, kintu bich-bich main kahin-kahin 'baramasa', 'thinti', 'dinarani', 'ghodian', 'siddh goshtee', 'karahale', 'birhade', 'sukhmani' aadi jaisi katipay choti badi vishisht rachanaayen bhi jod di gai hai jo saadhaaran lokgeeton ke kavyprakar udaahat karti hai
 Among the posts ranked according to those ragas, the Salok Sahas Kriti, 'gatha' Mahla 5, 'phunhe' Mahla 5, Choubolane Mahla 5, Savaiya Seemukh Vakha Mahla 5 and Mudavani Mahla 5 have been ranked and a ragamala has also been given at the end of all is
 in kritiyon ke bich-bich main bhi yadi kahin kabir evam shaikh farid ke 'salok' sangruhit hai to anyatra kinhin 11 padon dwaara nirmit ve stutiyaan di gai hai jo sikh guruon kii prashansa main kahi gai hai ore jinaki sankhya bhi kam nahin he
 The compositions stored in the 'granth' seem to be somewhat different due to linguistics, mostly providing examples of harmony and uniformity
 aadigranth ko kabhi-kabhi 'gurubaani' maatr bhi kah dete hai, kintu apane bhakton kii drushti main vah sadaa shariri guruswaroop he
 Therefore, like a Guru, he is 'covered' in a high cushion under the moonlight after wearing it in clean silk clothes, pouring flowers on it, offering flowers, taking his aarti and washing his bath in front of him and paying respectfully
 kabhi-kabhi uski shobhaayatra bhi nikaali jaati he tathaa sadaa uske anusaar chalane kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 The texts are recited weekly and sometimes monolithically, and some of the lines are recited even when the children are christened, they are initiated and Mangalotsavs are performed or cremated
 vishisht choti badi rachanaaon ke paath ke liye praat: kaal, siankal, shayanvela jaise upyukt samay nishchit hai ore yadhyapi pramukh sangruhit rachanaaon ke vishay pradhanat: darshanik siddhant, aadhyatmik sadhana evam stutigaan se hi sambandh rakhte jaan padate hai, isamen andeh nahin ki 'aadi granth' dwaara sikhon kaa puraa dharmik jivan prabhavit he
 a collection of Guru Gobind Singh is famous as 'dasam Granth' which is different and completely different from 'adigranth'
 guru granth sahib kaa lekhan gurumukhi lipi main hua he
 The Guruvaniyan of Guru Granth Sahib is incarnated in most of the state of Punjab and due to this the common people guess their language like Punjabi; While there is no such a thing
 shri gurugranth sahib kii bhashaa aadhunik punjabi bhashaa kii apeksha hindi bhashaa ke adhik sameep he or hindi-bhashi ko punjabi bhashi kii apeksha guru-vaaniyon kaa aashay adhik bodhgamy he
 On the other hand, even though the script of Shri Dasam Granth is Gurmukhi, its language is often poetical in Hindi
 isaki bhashaa punjabi-bhashiyon ke liye or adhik duruh kintu hindi-bhashiyon ke liye bhaleebhanti jaani-pahachaani he
 The language of Guru Granth Sahib is also called 'sant Bhasha' which is a mixture of many languages, sacrifices and subbolis, in which Lhindi Punjabi, Brajbhasha, Khadi Boli, Sanskrit and Persian etc
 are prominent

 This is often a sign of being the homeland of a language, so linguists believe that the adi-austronesian ancestor language originated here and then this language-family began to spread from here
 is vichaar ke anusaar aadi-austronishian samskruti sabase pehle taiwan main aaj se 5,500 varsh purv panpi thi
 Some linguists disagree with this ideology and based on genetic maternal clusters, it is likely that the oldest Austronesian culture actually originated somewhere near the island of Sulawesi 13,000–17,000 years ago and originated from the rise of the sea at the end of the last ice age
 Due to social instability, it began to spread outside its motherland

 In the fourteenth century Nicole Oresham proved that the harmonic range is divergent, but no one saw this result

 Historically the Harmonic sequence gained some fame among architects

 Prima facie, this category does not look easy because it is a divergent series, but rather its n th term when n is leading to infinity, leading to zero
 haraatmak shrenee kaa apsaran virodhabhas kaa ek spasht udhaaharan he
 An example of this is the worm on the rubber thread
 mana ki ek keedaa ek meter lambe rabar ke feete par mand gati se chalata he, prayek ek minute pashchaat rabar kaa feeta samroop ek meter khinch kar lambaa ho jaataa he
 If the worm crawls at the rate of one cm per minute, will the worm never reach the other end of the tape? But the answer would be "yes" to the contrary, after n minutes the ratio of the distance traveled by the worm and the total length of the tape would be: kyonki shrenee kaa maan swecch rup se badhata he jaise jaise n kaa maan badhata he, atah yah anupaat ek se adhik bhi hona chahie jisase siddh hota he ki keedaa feete ke ant tak pahunch jaayegaa
 The time it takes for this event to occur, ie n, may be higher, however, approximately e100 or even more than 1040
 yaddapi haraatmak shrenee apsaari he atah yah itnaa dhimen hota he
 Several consequences are available for the harmonic divergence, two of which are given here
 ise apsaari siddh karne kaa pratham tarika ise kisi anya apsaari shrenee ke saath tulana karne kaa he Each term in the harmonic category is larger or equal than each term in the comparison series, so the compilation of the harmonic category will also be greater than the sum of the second class
 yaddapi dwitiya shrenee kaa kul yoga anant he: This proves that the sum of the harmonic series must also be infinite
 duusare shabdon main uparokt tulana se siddh hota he ki Where k is a positive integer
