 In the 19th century, the process of empire's decline progressed

 As a result, major nations of Europe, such as Russia, France, etc

 In 1844, Tsar Nicholas i of Russia told the Foreign Minister of Britain, Lieburdin, that "turkey is the sick man of Europe

 Therefore, he wanted to maintain the territorial integrity of the Turkish Empire
 britain bhaleebhanti jaanata tha ki yadi rus kaa prabhaav turki par padataa he to usase britain ke africa sthit upnivesh tathaa bhartiya upnivesh ko khatra utpann ho saktaa he
 This is the reason why Britain on most occasions opposed Russia and supported Turkey

 But in violation of this agreement, the clergy of the Greek Church took away the rights of the Roman clergy

 For this reason Napoleon III interfered in the matter, favoring the Roman clergy
 vastutah france ke nepolian tritiy kaa uddeshy france ko europe kaa sarvshereshth raashtra banaakar gaurav or kirti hasil karnaa tha
 Napoleon's time in France was aimed at achieving glory and fame by making France the best nation in Europe

 Moreover, Napoleon III did not forget the Moscow defeat of his ancestor Napoleon i and wanted to avenge this defeat

 Under these circumstances, Nopolyan III favored the Roman clergy and demanded the return of their overlord from Jerusalem to the Turkish Sultan to take appropriate action in this regard as Jerusalem fell under the Turkish Empire

 The Berlin Congress of 1878 was the result of the disintegration of the Turkish Empire and the socialist policy of Russia and Austria
 'europe kaa marij' turki samrajya aantarik kalah evam vidroh kaa shikaar tha jisase samrajyavaadee desh laabh uthaanaa chaahate the
 Russia intervened during the rebellion of the Balkan region and imposed the Treaty of Sanstifeno on Turkey, but this treaty was not accepted by other imperialist countries of Europe and consequently forced Russia to accept the Berlin system
 1870 i
 ke france-prasha yuddh se laabh uthaate hue rus ne paris kii us vyavastha ko maanane se inkaar kar diya jiske dwaara kaala sagar main uski sainik gatividhiyon par pratibandh lagaaya gaya tha

 In such a situation, a new rival was raised against Russia in the Balkan region

 Russia, after losing in the Crimea war, tried to gain the support of the Slavic caste to strengthen its position
 usne balcon rajyon ke sabhi slaavon ko sangathit karne ke uddeshy se masco main ek sarv-slav sammelan 1867 i
 main yojit kiya, iskaa uddeshy sabhi slav logon ko sangathit kar turki samrajya ke viruddh vidroh karwaanaa tha
 Influenced by this movement, in 1875 AD, the people of Bosnia, Bulgaria revolted against the Turkish rule
 faltah turki ne nirdayatapurvak is vidroh ko kuchalane kaa prayaas kiya
 In such a situation, Russia intervened in Bosnia's favor and declared war
 rus ne turki ko parajeet kar saan-steffinon kii sandhi lad di
 Under this, Russia occupied some territories of Turkey
 srbija or romania ko purna swatantra rajya maan liya gaya or ek nae swatantra rajya bulgaria kaa nirmaan hua
 But the terms of the sa-stephan treaty were not acceptable to England and Austria as it hurt their interests
 atah unhone is sandhi ko radd karne kii maang is aadhaar par kii ki kisi ek raashtra ko balpurvak paris kii sandhi dwaara sthapit vyavastha ko samaapt karne kaa adhikaar nahin he
 Therefore, a conference of the concerned states should be called to consider the entire problem
 rus ne is maang ko asweekaar kar diya
 The conference was finally convened in Bismarck in mid-june 1878 in Berlin
 is sammelan main hui sandhi ke nimnlikhit praavdhaan the- The Berlin Congress claimed to solve the Balkan problem and prevent war between European states, but their claim was false
 vastutah britain ke pradhanmantri disraeli ne ghoshnaa kii “"berlin se main sammaan sahit shaanti laayaa"

 The Empire of Turkey gained renewal in Europe
 lekin disraeli kaa yah kathan satya se bahut dur tha
 The Berlin Congress ignored the nationalist will of the people of the Balkans and sacrificed them in front of the selfishness of the superpowers

 Whereas on the basis of the principle of nationality, these territories should have been given to Serbia

 Each Balkan state was dissatisfied with Berlin's decisions
 bulgaria ke asantosh kaa kaaran yah tha ki uskaa aakaar chota kar diya gaya tha
 Serbia regretted that the territory of Bosnia was given to Austria
 yunaan ko bhi unani bahul kshetra nahin mili
 In this way, Berlin was not able to solve the treaty problems, but it gave rise to new problems which put not only Europe but the whole world in crisis

 The word girl first appeared in use in the Middle Ages between 1250 and 1300 CE, and derives from the anglo-saxon word gerle and seems to have a connection with the older less important German word gör

 From 1530 onwards, the girl was understood to mean any young unmarried woman

 It is used in the sense of reproach when it is to express discrimination against children

 The term joking is used for people who act energetically or as a way of addressing women of all ages in an integrated manner
 In both cases, they are used even to positive use, when the ability of the term is used collectively as the sex of the girl rather than the age of the girl

 The novel describes the plight of French peasants discouraged from the French aristocracy that led to the revolution, the brutality of the prehistoric class by revolutionaries in the early years of the revolution and the many odd social similarities of life in London during the same period

 Jarvis Laurie is traveling from France to England to bring Dr
 Alexander Manet, an employee of Bank Taleson, to London
 Before entering France, he meets seventeen-year-old Lucy Manet in Dover and tells her that her father, Dr

 After arriving at his palace, Marquis meets his nephew: Charles Darnay
 unka tark he: daarne ko krishakon se sahanubhuti he jabaki markis krur or beraham he: "daman is the only permanent philosophy
 "dar or gulaami kaa kaala sammaan, mere dost," markis kahata he, "will keep the dog under the whip until looking upwards from this roof", "the sky is not visible
" us raat, gaspard sote hue markis kii hatya kar detaa he
 Leaving a part behind, "take it quickly to its grave
 This is from Jax
 " In London, Darnay gets Dr
 Manette's permission to marry Lucy
 lekin carton bhi lusi ke prati apana pyaar kabool karata he
 Knowing that she does not love him, Carton promises to "make every sacrifice for you and you dear ones"

 Nobody knows who Evermond is because Darnay has kept his real name a secret in England

 The letter is sent by Gabel, a servant of the former Marquis

 lekin usee shaam daarne ko phir giraftaar kar liya jaataa he or difaarge parivaar or ek "kisi agyaat" dwaara lagaae nae aaropon ke kaaran agle din phir se mukadmaa chalaaya jaataa he
 We soon learn from the testimony of his statement that this is the second Dr
 Manet, Manet does not know that his statement has been found and is horrified when his words are used to condemn him
 kisi kaam par, miss pros apane gumshuda bhai solaaman pros ko dekhakar chakit ho jaati he lekin pros nahin chahta ki use pahachaanaa jaae

 Carton threatens that he will identify Solomon as an Englishman and chancellor who spies for France or Britain at his convenience
 agar yah bataa diya gaya to solaaman ko nishchit rup se maar diya jayega, is tarah carton kaa palada baari he
 In the Tribunal, Darnay encounters the Mussoorie Defarge who identifies Darnay as Marquis St
 Evermond and reads Dr
 Manet's letters hidden in his chamber in Bastille
 difaarge evermmond ke rup main daarne kii pahchaan kar saktaa he kyonki pustak 2, adhyay 16 main difaarge parivaar kii sharaab kii dukaan par jab barsaad jaankaree ikatthi kar rahaa tha to barsaad ne use daarne kii pahchaan bataayi thi
 The letter described how Dr
 Manette was locked up in Bastille by the deceased Marquis Evermond and his own twin brother for trying to report their crimes against a peasant family
 chota bhai ek ladki par mugdh ho gaya tha
 He kidnaps her, rapes her and kills her husband, upon receiving the news that her father died and her brother was killed in a fight to protect her honor
 jis kisaan stri kaa balaatkaar hua tha uske bhai ne marane se pehle parivaar ke antim sadsy, apni choti bahan ko, "kahin surakshit" chipa diya tha
 The end of the article denounces the Evermond family, "him and his descendants, the last man of the breed"
 dow manet bhaybheet ho uthta he lekin uske virodh kii upeksha kar di jaati he-use apni ninda waapas lene kii anumati nahin he
 Darnay is sent to the Conservatory and sentenced to guillotine the next day
 carton difaarge parivaar kii sharaab kii dukaan main chalaa jaataa he jahaan vah daarne ke baaki ke parivaar ko pratadit karne kii madam difaarge kii yojanaon ke bare main sun letaa he
 Carton learns that Madame Defarge was the surviving sister of the peasant family that was destroyed by the Evermond family
 kathanak kii ekmaatr jaankaree jisase madam difaarge ke liye koi sahanubhuti utpann ho sakati he vah he ki uskaa parivaar kho chukaa he or ki uskaa koi naam nahin he
 "defarge" is the name after her marriage, and Dr
 Manette does not know her family name, though he asks her dying sister
 jab dow manet raat bhar charles ko bachaane ke vifal prayaason se hataash hokar agali subah lautataa he to us par juute banane kaa paagalpan phir savaar ho jaataa he
 Carton urges Laurie to flee Paris with Lucy, her father, and "little Lucy"
 usee subah carton jail main daarne se mulaakaat karata he
 Carton makes Darne unconscious with the drug and Barsad brings Darne out of prison
 carton- jo itnaa zyaada daarne ke samaan dikhataa he ki england main daarne ke mukademe main ek gavaah unamem antar nahin bataa saktaa-daarne hone kaa naatak karne kaa or uske sthaan par marane kaa faisalaa karata he
 He does this by remembering his promise to Lucy, for the love of her
 carton ke pehle nirdeshon kaa paalan karte hue daarne kaa parivaar or lorie buggy main ek behosh aadmi jiske paas pahchaan patr carton ke hai lekin vastav main daarne he, ke saath paris or frans se palaayan kar jate hai
 Meanwhile, Madame Defarge, armed with a pistol, goes to the Lucie family residence hoping to catch them mourning for the scare but Lucy, her child, Dr
 Manette, and Mr
 Laurie are already gone
 unhen bachaav kaa samay dene ke liye, miss pros madam difaarge se bhid jaati he or unmensangharsh hota he
 Pross speaks only English and Defarge only French, so no one can understand each other
 In the fight, Madame Defarge's pistol goes off, she is killed; Miss Pross is permanently deaf due to the noise of the shot and the shock of Madame Defarge's death
 upanyaas sidney carton ko gilotine karne ke saath samaapt hota he
 Carton's final thoughts foretell: Carton appears that several revolutionaries, including Defarge, Barsad, and The Vengeance, will be sent to guillotine themselves and that Darnay and Lucy will have a son they will name after Carton : Son who will fulfill all the promises left incomplete by the carton
 pustak kii shuruyaat main lusi or daarne kaa pehla betaa paidaa hota he or ek hi para ke bheetar mar jaataa he
 It is likely that this first son arrives in the novel so that his second son, named Carton, may represent another way in which Carton restores Lucy and Darnay through his sacrifice
 —final sentence of a Tale of Two Cities a Tale of Two Cities is one of only two historical novels by Charles Dickens
 charles dicens ke ek vishisht upanyaas kii tulana main isamen kam paatr or up-kathanak hai
 The author's primary historical source was The French Revolution: a History by Thomas Carlile: Charles Dickens wrote in the Preface to the Tale that "one cannot hope to add anything to the philosophy of Mr
 Carlyle's wonderful book"
 Goes through the cycle of revival, having a significant impact on the novel, portrayed particularly well by the life and death of Sidney Carton Or was
 dicens angrezi bolne main asamarth paatro ke liye francisi muhaavaron ke shabdic anuwaad kaa upyog karte hai jaise, "us gali main tum kya karte ho?!!" And "where is my husband? --- Here you see me
 " upanyaas ke penguin clasix sanskaran main note diya gaya he ki "sabhi pathakon ne prayog ko kaamyaab nahin mana he
 " dicens apane hasya ke liye vikhyath hai lekin i tail of tu citis unki sabase kam hasyakaarak pustak he
 Nonetheless, Jerry Cruncher, Miss Pross and Mr
 Stryver provide comedy
 vibhinn drushtikonon ko darshane ke liye dicens pustak main vyangy kaa upyog hasya ke rup main karte hai
 The book is full of tragic circumstances so there is not much room for Dickens' humor
 = In Dickens's England, resurrection is always in a Christian context
 mote taur par, sidney carton kii aatma upanyaas ke ant main punerjeevit kii jaati he And more realistically, the "first book" deals with the death of Dr
 Manet from incarcerated death to rebirth
 punerjeevan pehali baar tab prakat hota he jab shri lorie jeri crunchar ke sandesh kaa uttar "jivan ko vaapasi" shabdon ke saath dete hai
 Mr
 Laurie's resurrection is also revealed to Dowager during his ride to the cab, as he constantly contemplates the assumed conversation with Dr
 Manet: he believes that he is helping Dr
 Manet revive, and that imagination Let's do this by "digging" himself and removing Dr
 Manette from the grave
 punerjeevan upanyaas kaa mukhya vishay he
 Revival is first seen in Jarvis Laurie's thoughts about Dr
 Manette as a subject matter
 yahi antim vishay-vastu bhi he: carton kaa balidaan
 dicens multah puure upanyaas ko ricold tu life kaa naam dena chaahate the
 Jerry is also part of this recurring theme: he is involved in death and resurrection in a way that the reader does not yet know
 Its first foreshadowing is found in his own commentary: "jerry, if life returns to fashion, you will be silver!" The somber humor of this statement becomes apparent much later
 paanch saal baad, ek andheri or badalon bhari raat, shri lorie jeri se yah kahkar ki "yah bahut-kuch 


mritkon ko kabr se baahar laane kii raat he," rahasyatmakataa main pathak kii ruchi ko punarjagrit karte hai
 Jerry firmly replies that he has never seen her do this at night
 pataa lagata he ki punerjeevan kii vishay-vastu ke saath jeri crunchar kii bhagidaariyahi he ki vah victorian bhashaa main kaha jane vaala "punerjeevan dene vaala manushya" he, vah jo chikitsa se jude logon ko bechney ke liye shavon ko khod nikaalata he 
 Undoubtedly, the opposite of resurrection is death
 mrityu or punerjeevan upanyaas main aksar dikhaai dete hai
 Dickens is displeased that courts in France and England award capital punishment for trivial offenses
 frans main kisi kuleen kii jhak par bina koi mukadmaa kiye kisaanon ko maut ke ghat tak utaar diya jaataa he
 Marquis happily tells Darnay that "in the next room, a man 


 was stabbed at the site in honor of his daughter - for talking to his daughter with a grudge about a delicious meal
" " Interestingly, the destruction of Dr
 Manette's shoe-making bench by Miss Pross and Mr
 Laurie has been described as "burning the body"
 yah spasht lagata he ki yah ek durlabh maamla he jahaan mrityu yaa vinaash kaa sakaaratmak arth he kyonki "jalanaa" doctor ko uske lambey karawas kii smriti se mukt karne main madad karata he
 But Dickens's description of this kind and formal work is very ajeeb he: The destruction and secrecy of the true mind so much that Mr
 Laurie and Miss Pross, while doing their work and erasing its marks, feel this and feel as if they are involved in a crime
 sidney carton kii shahadat use ateet main kiye gaye uske sabhi galat kaamon se mukt karti he
 During the last few days of his life he also finds God by repeating Christ's relieving words, "I am the resurrection and the life"
 punerjeevan upanyaas ke antim bhaag kii pramukh vishay-vastu he
 Darnay is saved at the last moment and recalled to life, Carton chooses death and resurrection in place of a life better than his own: "he was the face of a very calm man
 

 vah udaatt or dev samaan dikh rahaa tha"
 In a broader sense, at the end of the novel Dickens was forced from the ashes of the old in France
 ek punerjeevit saamaajik vyavastha kii ummid dikhti he
 Many would agree with the typical European tradition, Hans Biedermann, who writes that water is "the basic symbol of all the energy of the unconscious — an energy that can be dangerous even if it transcends its proper limits
" yah pratikwaad dicens ke upanyaas ko raas aata haih i tail of tu citis main aksar jal kaa bimb kisaanon kii bheed ke badhate krodh kaa pratik he, aisa krodh jisase kuch had tak dicens sahanubhuti rakhte hai lekin antat ise tarkahin or pashavik bhi maanate hai
 At the beginning of the book, Dickens explains this by writing, "the sea did what it liked and loved destruction
" " yahan samudr bheed yaa krantikariyon ke aane kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 When Gaspard kills Marquis, he is "hanged there at a height of forty feet — and left hanging, poisoning the waters
" kuen kii vishaaktata gaspard ke vadh se kisaanon kii samuhik bhaavana par pade katu prabhaav kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 After Gaspard's death, the raid on Bastille is led by the Defarge family, "since the boiling water is the focal point of the vortex, all of this outbreak revolves around Defarge's liquor store and is drawn towards the vortex
 The trend was in every human drop of the pan
 

" The crowd is envisioned as a sea
 "aisi garjan ke saath jisase lage maano ki frans kii samast saans ne ek ghinaune shabd kaa rup le liya ho, sajiv samudr main lahar par lahar, gaharaai par gaharaai kaa ufaan aayaa or shahar ko jalmagn kar gaya
 

 " daarne ke jailer ko "bhadde bhang se foole chehre or sharir vaala aadmi jo maano dub gaya ho or pani se bhar gaya ho" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 Later, during the reign of terror, the revolution "became so overbearing and distracting 


 that the rivers of the south were filled with dead bodies of violently submerged at night
 

" a crowd later "bad rahi he or paas kii galiyon main bah nikali he
 

 Carmenola takes everyone in himself and takes them away
 " During a fight with Miss Pross, Madame Defarge clings to her in a way that is "more than a drowning woman's grip"
 upanyaas par tippaneekaron ne us vidambnaa par dhyaan diya he ki madam difaarge apni hi bandook se maari jaati he or shaayad uparyukt kathan se dicens sanket karte hai ki madam difaarge jaisi shaatir pratishodh kii bhaavana antat apane shikariyon ko bhi nasht kar degi
 Many read the novel in Freud's light, ahem and ahem
 Yet Carton in his final move sees a tornado that "wandered aimlessly until the stream absorbed it into the ocean" —a saturation even though the work and ahem Driven but there is a frenetic union with the subconscious
 jaisaa ki angrezi sahitya main aam he, prakaash or andhkaar achchhai or buraai ke pratik hai
 Lucy Manette is often associated with light and Madame Defarge with darkness
 lusi pehali baar difaarge parivaar dwaara rakhe gaye kamare main She meets her father
 " lusi ke bal khushi kaa pratik hai jab vah "unhen ek saath baandhne ke liye sunaharaa dhaagaa" baandhti he
 She is embellished with "very bright and shining diamonds", and symbolizes the joy of her wedding day
 andhera anischitata, bhay or jokhim kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Mr
 Laurie leaves Dowager in the dark, dark in the prisons, chasing the black Saiyadam Defarge, harassing Dr
 Manette in a deep, sad melancholy, his arrest and closure are shrouded in darkness, the Marquis's possessions of the night
 Burned in the dark, Jerry Cruncher loots the tombs in the dark, Charles's second arrest is also in the night
 lusi or shri lorie donon ko madam difaarge se gaharaa khatra mahasoos hota he
 Lucy comments, "that terrible woman seems to be possessed by me"
 Although Mr
 Laurie tries to comfort him, "that too overshadows the manner of the Defarge family
" " Madame Defarge is "like a shadow on a white road", snow is a symbol of purity and Madame Defarge is a symbol of dark corruption
 dicens khun ke gahare rang kii tulana bhi shuddh safed barf se karte hai: rakt ise bahaane waalon ke aparaadhon kaa rang le letaa he
 As a child, Charles Dickens was forced to work in the factory because of his bitter experience, sympathizing with the persecuted poor
 tathaapi krantikariyon ke saath uski sahanubhuti sirf ek seemaa tak hi thi, vah bheed ke paagalpan kii aalochana karata he jo jald hi chaa jaataa he
 When one night the mad men and women massacre eleven hundred detainees and return quickly to lay their arms on San, they display "eyes for which any kindly spectator would see a properly pointed gun
 It would have taken twenty years of life together
 " pathak ko dikhaaya gaya he ki frans or england main garibon par ek jaise hi atyaachaar hote hai
 As crime continues to increase, the executioner in England is "tying long queues of miscellaneous criminals, now hanging burglars 


 now burning people's hands" or hanging bankruptcy for stealing six pence
 frans main, ek ladke kaa haath kaat diya jaataa he or jinda jalaane kii sazaa sunai jaati he, sirf isliye kyonki pachaas gaj kii duuri par guzar rahi bhikshuon kii ek parade ke saamne usne barish main ghutane nahin teke
 mossenur ke bhavy nivas main miltaa he, "sabase bure sansaarik vishwa ke besharm padri, kaamuk ankhen, belgaum jubaan or nirlajj jivan 


 Marquis Sanand remembers the days when his family had authority over the lives and deaths of their slaves, "when many such dogs were taken out to be hanged"
 He did not even allow a widow to put a board in her deceased husband's name to distinguish it from the tomb of others
 vah madam difaarge ke biimaar devar ko puure din gaadi bharne or raat main mendhakon ko dur bhagane kaa aadesh detaa he taaki jawan aadmi kii beemaari bad jaae or vah jaldi mar jaae
 In England, banks also inflicted unbalanced punishments: the man was punished to death for whipping the horse or opening a letter
 jelon kii haalat bhayanak hoti thi
 "there were many kinds of corrupt conduct and wickedness and 


 terrible diseases were produced", sometimes judges were killed before the accused
 angrezi kanoon kii krurta se dicens itnaa ukhde hue hai ki vah iske kuch dand par vyangy karte hai: "kode lagane vaala khamba, ek or purana priy santhaan, dekhne main bahut maanviya or vahaan kii gatividhiyaan bahut dayalutapurna"
 He blames the law for not reforming: "whatever is right" is Bailey's old saying
 chaar tukdon main chirane kaa bheeshan chithran isaki krurta par prakaash daalata he
 Without completely forgiving him, Dickens understands that Jerry Cruncher robs graves to fill his son's stomach and reminds the reader that it is possible that Mr
 Laurie owes Jerry more for his inferior social status than for any other reason
 Cursing
 jeri shri lorie ko yaad dilaataa he ki doctor, bajaj, chandaal or chaukeedaar bhi sharir bechney kii sajeesh main shaamil hai
 Dickens wants to warn his readers that the revolution that devastated France would not happen in Britain, which has been shown to be as unjust as France
 lekin unki chetavanee britain ke nichle virgon ko sambodhit nahin he balki abhijatya varg ke liye he
 He repeatedly uses the metaphor of sowing and reaping; if the elite continue to sow the seeds of revolution through unjust behavior, they must harvest the revolution when the time comes
 is roopak main nimna varg kaa koi abhikaran nahin hai: ve keval abhijatya varg ke vyavhaar par pratikriya vyakt karte hai
 In this sense it can be said that although Dickens sympathizes with the poor, he identifies himself with the rich: he is the listener of the book, it is "we" and not "they"
 "crush humanity once more with similar hammers and it will take its own form of torture
 Again, sowing seeds of greed and oppression will produce similar fruits
" kuch kaa kahana he ki i tail of tu citis main dicens ne atharah varshiya abhinetri ellen teranan ke saath haal hi main shuru apane sambhawatah alangik lekinnishchit rup se romantic prem sambandh ko darshaya he Lucy Manette physically resembles Ternan, and some see "an inherent emotional incest" in the relationship between Dr
 Manette and her daughter
 viki colins ke naatak da frozan deep main abhinay karne ke baad pehle pahal dicens tail likhane ke liye prerit hue
 In the play, Dickens plays the role of a man who sacrifices his life so that his rival can find the woman they both love, in the play's love triangle Tale of Charles Darnay, Lucy Manette and Sidney Carton Formed the basis of relationships between sidney carton or charles daarne ne bhi dicens ke vyaktigat jivan par mahatvapurn prabhaav daalaa

 There is evidence that leprosy does not develop in all people infected with M
 leprae and it has long been believed that genetic factors also have a role in it because leprosy has been seen in some specific families and is Success in understanding why lepromatous leprosy develops in some people, while lepromatous leprosy in others Sector are growing
 aisa anumaan he ki anuvaanshik karkon ke kaaran keval 5% logon main hi kushtarog hone kaa khatra hota he
 Mostly this is because the body is naturally immune to this bacterium, and those who become infected with it are experiencing an acute allergic reaction to the disease

 In short, penetration through the respiratory tract is the most likely route, although other routes, especially broken skin, cannot be ignored
 The CDC has expressed the following assumption about the transmission of the disease: "although the route of transmission of Hansen's disease remains uncertain, most researchers believe that M
 leprae usually spreads from person to person via respiratory drops

 " In leprosy, it is difficult to define reference points for both the incubation period and the time of infection and the measurement of the onset of disease; The first one due to adequate immunological devices and the second due to the slow onset of the disease 
 Despite this, various researchers have attempted to measure the incubation time for leprosy

 Although annual expansion as a measure of transmission — the number of new cases of leprosy received annually — is important, leprosy is characterized by long incubation periods, late diagnosis and early stages of the disease
 Leprosy is difficult to measure due to lack of laboratory equipment to be able to do this
 iske bajaay, panjikrut prasar kaa prayog kiya jaataa he
 Registered prevalence is a useful representative indicator of the burden of the disease because it indicates the number of active cases of leprosy diagnosed with the disease at any point in time and receiving MDT treatment

 pichley varsh ke dauraan pahachaane gaye nae maamalon kii sankhya 296,499 thi
 The reason for this annual identification number exceeding its prevalence at the end of that year can be explained by the fact that a part of new cases completed their treatment within a year and hence they are no longer on the register
 The number of new cases identified globally continues to decline and in 2005 it decreased by 110,000 cases compared to the previous year

 Positron emission tomography) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that produces a three-dimensional image or picture of the body's functional processes
 yah pranali ek pozitron-utsarjit radionucliide dwaara apratyaksh rup se utsarjit gamma kirnon ke jode kaa pataa lagaati he, jise sharir main ek jaivik rup se sakriy anu par pravesh karaayaa jaataa he
 Images of the tracer concentration are then reconstructed by computer analysis in a 3-dimensional or 4-dimensional space within the body
 aadhunik scanron main, yah punarnirmaan praayah marij par kiye gaye city eks-re kii sahaayta se usee satr ke dauraan, usee mashin main kiya jaataa he
 If the biologically active molecule selected by PET is a glucose-related FDG, then the tracer's image of concentration provides tissue metabolic activity in the form of spatial glucose uptake

 To perform this scan, a short-term radioactive tracer isotope is injected into a live object
 anurekhak ko ek jaivik rup se sakriy anu main rasinic rup se shaamil kiya jaataa he
 One has to wait for a period of time until the active molecule is concentrated in the target tissue; The research subject or patient is then placed in an image-taking scanner
 is uddeshy purti ke liye aam taur par jis anu kaa sabase adhik istemaal kiya jaataa he vah he florodioxiglucose he, ek chini jiske liye pratiksha avadhi aam taur par ek ghante kii hoti he
 a record of tissue concentration is created as the tracer decays during the scan

 After moving forward by a few millimeters, that positron encounters an electron
 is bhidnt ke kaaran donon kaa hi khaatmaa ho jaataa he, jisase vipareet dishaao main chalane vaale ek jodi vinaashak gamma photone utpaadit hote hai
 These are identified when they glow in the scanning apparatus, illuminating them which are identified by photomultiplier tubes or silicon avalanche photodiodes

 In real use the LOR has a finite width because the distance of the emitted photon is not exactly 180 degrees
 yadi detectaron ke hal karne kii avadhi 10 nanosecond ke bajaae 500 picosecond se kam he, tab is parinaam kaa ek taar ke khand main sthaniyakaran sambhav he, jisaki lambaai detector ke samay sankalp dwaara nirdhaarit kii jaati he
 As time resolution improves, the signal to noise ratio of the image is improved, requiring fewer events to achieve the same quality of image
 yah takanic abhi aam nahin he, lekin yah kuch nai pranaaliyon main uplabdh he
 Generally, a technique similar to reconstructed computed tomography and single photon emission computed tomography data is used, although the data set collected in PET is much worse than CT, so the reconstruction technique would be difficult is

 The resulting map shows the tissue in which the molecular probe is concentrated and can be considered by a nuclear medicine doctor or radiation therapist in the context of the patient's treatment and diagnosis
 PET scan ko chumbakeey anunaad imaging scan ke saath-saath adhyayan kiya jaataa he, yah sangyojan shaareerik or chayapachay, donon jaankaree pradaan karata he, 
 Because PET imaging is most useful in association with structural imaging such as CT, modern PET scanners are now available with integrated high-tech multi-detector-row CT scanners
 kyonki yah donon scan ek hi satr ke dauraan tatkaal anukram main kiya ja saktaa he, donon scanon ke bich mariz ko apni sthiti badalane kii jarurat nahin padati, chhaviyon ke do set vidhi purvak darj ho jate hai, taaki PET imaging main dikhaae gaye vikrutiyon vaale kshetra ko adhik vishmata se shaareerik rachana ke saath sahasambaddha karke CT chhaviyon main dekha ja saktaa he
 It is useful in showing a detailed view of the image of movable organs or structures with greater diversity in anatomy, usually outside the brain

 Currently, only the head and brain images can be taken with the strength of these high magnetic fields
 PET scanning main prayog kiye jane vaale radionucliide aam taur par ardh-jivan vaale isotope hai, jaise carbon-11, nitrogen-13, oxigen-15 or fluorine-18 
 These radionuclides either contain compounds that the body normally uses, such as glucose, water, or ammonia, or are involved in molecules that bind to the receptor or other sites of drug action
 is tarah ke labelkrut yogic, radiunurekhak ke rup main jane jate hai
 It is important to recognize that the PET technique can be used to identify the biological path of any compound in living humans, provided it is radiolabeled with PET isotopes
 is prakaar ve vishisht prakriyaayein jinhen PET ke saath jaancha ja saktaa he, lagbhag aseem hai or nae lakshyit anuon or prakriyaaon ke liye radiunurekhak ko sabhi samay sanshleshit kiya jaataa he; is lekh ke likhane tak darjanon kaa upyog naidanik rup se kiya ja rahaa he or saikadon kaa anusandhan main
 vartmaan main, haalanki, ab tak naidanik PET scanning main aamtaur par sabase adhik istemaal kiya jane vaala newclid he FDG ke rup main fluorine-18
 Due to the half-life of most radioisotopes, radioimulators must be produced using a cyclotron and radiochemical laboratory that are adjacent to the PET imaging facility
 fluorine-18 kaa ardh-jivan itnaa lanbaa hota he ki fluorine-18 label vaale radiunurekhak ko sait se duurastha sthaan par vyavsaayik rup se nirmit kiya ja saktaa he
 Reduction of radiation dose to the patient is an attractive feature of the use of short-lived radionuclides
 naidanik takanic ke rup main isaki sthapit bhoomika ke alaava, chikitsa ke prati pratikriya kaa akalan karne kii ek paddati ke rup main PET kii ek vistrut bhoomika he, vishesh rup se, cancer chikitsa, jahaan pareekshan vikiran se hone vaale jokhim kii tulana main rog kii pragati ke bare main agyanta se rogi ke liye kahin adhik khatra hota he
 What hinders the widespread use of PET is the high cost of cyclotron required to manufacture low-gv radionuclides for PET scanning and the need for specially adapted on-site chemistry equipment to produce radioactivity
 Few hospitals and universities are able to maintain such a system and most clinical pets are supported by third-party suppliers of radioanalysts that can supply multiple sites simultaneously
 yah seemaa, naidanik PET ko mukhyatah un anurekhak ke upyog tak simit kar detii he jo fluorine-18 se label hai, jinke paas 110 minute kaa ardh-jivan he or unhen upyog se pehle ek uchit duuri tak bheja ja saktaa he, yaa phir rubidiam-82 jise ek portable janarator main banaaya ja saktaa he or iskaa upyog miocardial dravniveshan adhyayan ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Nevertheless, in recent years on-site cyclotrons with integrated shielding and hot laboratories have been sent to remote hospitals with PET units
 laghu on-site cychlotron kii upasthiti ke bhavishya main vistrut hone kii aashaa he kyonki duurastha PET mashiinon tak isotope ko bhejne main aane vaali ucch laagat kii pratikriya swaroop cychlotron ghatate ja rahe hai
 Since the half-life of fluorine-18 is about two hours, a dose of radioactivity holding this radionuclid will undergo several half-lives of decay during the working day
 This necessitates frequent remodeling of the remaining dose and careful planning regarding patient scheduling
 PET scinar dwaara ekatrit aprishkrut aankade 'sanyogi ghatnaon' kii ek suchi hoti he jo ek jode detectaron ke dwaara lagbhag ek saath hue vinaashak photonon ke pahchaan kaa pratinidhitiv karti he
 Each coincident event represents a line connecting the two detectors with which the positron emission occurred

 Coincident events can be divided into projection images called cynograms

 sinogram chhaviyaan, computed tomography scinar dwaara khinche gaye prakshepan ke anuroop hoti hai or thik oosee tareeke se punarnirmit kii ja sakati he
 Statistics of data, however, are much worse than data obtained through transmission tomography
 ek saamaanya PET data set main puure adhigrahan ke liye lakhon ginati hoti hai, jabaki siti main kuch arab tak gina jaataa saktaa he
 By the way, PET data suffer much more dramatically from scatter and irregular events than CT data
 praayogikta main, data kaa kaaphi maatra main purv-prakraman aavashyak hota he jaise - aniyamit sanyogon kaa sudhaar, bikhare photonon kaa anumaan or ghataav, detector ke ruke hue samay kaa sudhaar or detector kii samvedansheeltaa main sudhaar 
 Back filtered projection is often used to reconstruct images from projection
 is elgorithm main saral hone kaa phayda he, saath hi isamen computing sansadhano kii kam hi aavashyaktaa he
 However, the raw data in the reconstructed image has considerable shot noise and the high tracer area of the trajectory forms streaks around the images
 aavarti expecteresn-meximiraseshan elgorithm ab punarnirmaan ke pasandida tareeke hai
 This has the advantage that there is a better noise profile and resistance to streak errors that FBP does not have, but the disadvantage is that it requires higher computer processing
 kshinan sudhaar: chunki bhinn LOR ke liye utak kii vibhinn motaai ko paar karnaa jaruri hota he, photonon ko alag tareeke se tanukrut kiya jaataa he
 As a result, the structures at the depth of the body are reconstructed with low tracer levitation in the false form

 While attenuation-refined images are generally more accurate performance, the correction process itself is sensitive to critical errors
 natijatan, sanshodhit or asanshodhit, donon hi chhaviyon ko hameshaa punarnirmit kiya jaataa he or ek saath padhaa jaataa he
 2D / 3D Reconstruction: Early PET scanners had only a single ring of detector, so data acquisition and subsequent reconstruction prohibited a single transverse plane
 adhik aadhunik scinar main ab kai ringon ko shaamil kiya gaya he or anivaary rup se sansuchako kii ek silendar banaai gai he
 There are two approaches to reconstructing data from a scanner of that type : 1) Treat each ring as a separate unit, so that it can detect coincidence within the ring, reconstructing the image of each ring individually
 , Or 2) allow the coincidence to be detected at the center of the ring as well as within the ring, then rebuild the entire volume together

 The appearance of the sub-nanosecond time resolution detector provides better random coincidence rejection and thus supports 3D image reconstruction

 However, it is possible that PET images can be obtained using a conventional double-headed gamma camera with a coincidence detector
 gamma camera PET kii gunvattta kaaphi kam he or adhigrahan dhimaa he
 However, for institutions with low demand for PET, it may allow on-site imaging, rather than referring patients to other centers or relying on an inspection by a mobile scanner
