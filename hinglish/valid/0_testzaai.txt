 Education is a dynamic process Nikhil , samajashastriyon, manovaigyanikon va nitikaron ne shiksha ke sambandh main apane vichaar die hai
 These ideas also help us understand the meaning of education
 kuch shiksha sambandhi mukhya vichaar yahan prastut kiye ja rahe hai - The main objective of education in ancient India is the desire for 'mukti'
 baad main samay ke rup badalane se shiksha ne bhi usee tarah uddeshy badal liye
 From the point of view of system, there are three forms of education - aupchaarik shiksha niraupchaarik shiksha anaupchaarik shiksha The education that goes on in schools, colleges and universities is called formal education
 is shiksha ke uddeshy, paathyacharya or shikshan vidhiyaan, sabhi nishchit hote hai
 It is planned and has a rigorous plan
 isamen seekhney waalon ko vidhyalay, mahavidhyalay athwa vishvavidhyalay kii samay sarini ke anusaar kaary karnaa hota he
 It has a system of taking exams and providing certificates
 is shiksha kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki yah vyakti, samaaj or raashtra kii aavashyaktaaon kii purti karti he
 It develops knowledge and skills in a person and makes him / her eligible for any business or industry
 parantu yah shiksha badi vyay-saadhy hoti he
 With this, money, time and energy all have to be spent
 vah shiksha jo aupchaarik shiksha kii bhanti vidhyalay, mahavidhyalay, or vishvavidhyalayon kii seemaa main nahin baandhi jaati he
 But like formal education, its purpose and curriculum are fixed, the only difference is in its planning which is very flexible
 iskaa mukhya uddeshy saamaanya shiksha kaa prasar or shiksha kii vyavastha karnaa hota he
 Its curriculum has been fixed keeping in mind the needs of the learners
 shikshanvidhiyon va seekhney ke sthanon va samay aadi seekhney waalon kii suvidhananusaar nishchit hota he
 Adult education, continuing education, open education and distance education are all different forms of non-formal education
 is shiksha kii sabase badi visheshta yah he ki iske dwaara un bacchon / vyaktiyon ko shikshit kiya jaataa he jo aupchaarik shiksha kaa laabh nahin uthaa paae jaise - This education also imparts continuity to the education of the individual, he is introduced to the new inventions of his field and trained to meet the needs of the time
 vah shiksha jisaki koi yojana nahin banaai jaati he; jiske na uddeshy nishchit hote hai na paathyacharya or na shikshan vidhiyaan or jo aakasmik rup se sadaiv chalati rahati he, use anaupchaarik shiksha kehete hai
 This education goes on throughout the life of a human being and it has the most impact on him

 jab vah vidhyalay main aupchaarik shiksha grahan karne aata he to ek vyaktitva ke saath aata he jo ki uski anaupchaarik shiksha kaa pratifal he
 In order to give proper direction to the language and conduct of a person, to organize his experiences, to train him in any task according to his interest, tendency and ability, and for the promotion and propagation of public education, we are required to legislate formal and non-formal education

 Nowadays the name of this city is Dwarikapuri
 dwarikapuri main nivas karne vaale satrajit yadav ne suryanarayan kii aradhana kii
 Then Lord Surya gave him a gem called Syamantaka, which gave him eighty pieces of gold, from his neck
 mani paakar satrajit yadav jab samaaj main gaya to shrikrishna ne us mani ko praapt karne kii ichha vyakt kii
 Satrajit did not give the gem to Shri Krishna and gave it to his brother Prasenjit
 ek din prasenjit ghode par chadhakar shikaar ke liye gaya
 There a lion killed him and took the gem
 richon kaa raja jamvant us singh ko markar mani lekar gupha main chalaa gaya
 When Prasenjit did not return from hunting for several days, Satrajit felt very sad
 usne sochaa, shrikrishna ne hi mani praapt karne ke liye uskaa vadh kar diya hoga
 So, without gathering any kind of information, he preached that Shri Krishna killed Prasenjit and took away the Samantaka gem
 is lok-ninda ke nivaaran ke liye shrikrishna bahut se logon ke saath prasenjit ko dhundne van main gaye
 There, he got the symbols to kill Prasenjit by a lion and kill the lion by bear
 rich ke pairon kii khoj karte-karte ve jamvant kii gupha par pahunche or gupha ke bheetar chale gaye
 There he saw that the daughter of Jamwant is playing with that gem
 shrikrishna ko dekhte hi jamvant yuddh ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 War broke out

 The dates of the beginning and end of this campaign are disputed by historians, but in most opinion it began with the Vienna Conference on the end of Napoleon Bonaparte's reign over Italy in 1815, and in 1870 by the armies of King Fiancorio Emanuele on Rome
 It went on till occupation
 dhyaan den ki 1870 ke baad bhi kuch italvi pradesh is sangathit italy main shaamil nahin the or ve pratham vishwayuddh ke baad hi uskaa hissaa bane
 Due to the wars of Napoleon, the Italians experienced a sense of unity and decided to organize their country as one nation
 isiilie vahaan rashtriyata or udaaravaadi shaktiyon ne anek baar sir uthaaya, par inhen kuchal diya gaya
 The history of Rome's ancient glory was known to the people

 Therefore, he once again dreamed of making Italy a national icon
 yahi kaaran he ki anek kathinaayeeyon or vifaltaaon ke baavjood vahaan rashtriya-ekikaran kaa sangharsh jari rahaa
 The ultimate success was liberalism and nationalism against reactionaryism, and the work of unification of Italy was completed
 is ekikaran kaa ek lanbaa itihaas he
 The Vienna Congress disregarded the will of the people and the spirit of nationalism, reviving various states in Italy
 uske dwaara italy kii jo naveen vyavastha kii gayi, uski ruparekha is prakaar thi- Thus Italy was divided into three parts
 inamen alag-alag shaasha the
 It was not favorable in terms of nationality, so the people there were dissatisfied with this system
 aisi sthiti main unhone sampurna italy ko ek raashtra kaa darja pradaan karne kaa prayaas kiya
 There were many obstacles in the success of this work, which needed to be overcome
 1815 i

 iske liye unhone anek gupt-samitiyon kaa gathan kiya, jinamein carbonary sabase-prasiddh thi
 Its net was laid in almost all of Italy
 isaki prerana se italy main anek vidroh hue, jinhen meternikh ke dwaara kuchal diya gaya
 Therefore, the belief of the people became firm that the efforts of unity would not be successful until the influence of Austria ceased from there
 dekhen, jeusepe metsini Mezzini is credited with perfecting Italy's ideal of national integration
 uskaa janm 1805 i
 main geneva main hua tha
 He was greatly influenced by the Kingdom of France

 He kept studying inspirational literature after getting inspiration from his father, so he became a foster of revolutionary ideas from childhood
 padhai samaapt karne ke baad vah carbonary kaa sadsy ban gaya
 Due to liberal views he was arrested in 1830 AD
 lagbhag ek varsh tak vah senona kii jail main kaid rahaa
 After his release from prison, he formed an organization called "youth-italy", which brought political awakening in the country
 isaki sadsy sankhya main nirantar vruddhi hoti gayi
 In 1833, the number of young-italy members increased to 60 thousand
 usne yah kaha ki naye vichaar tabhi failte hai jab use shheedon ke khun se sinchaa jaataa he
 He considered the leadership of the youth important
 vah desh kii tatkaaleen vyavastha se dukhi tha or usamen sudhaar laane kaa upaay sochataa tha
 Addressing the people of the country, he said that our reputation and progress is blocked
 hamaari shandaar pracheen parampara rahi he, par vartmaan main na hamaara koi rashtriya astitv nahin he
 He blamed Austria for this
 atah usne uske khilaaf sangathit hokar uskaa saamana karne kii aavashyaktaa pratipaadit kii
 In this way, Mezzini, with his ideas, encouraged the people of Italy for national integration and filled them with a sense of patriotism and sacrifice
 vah swayan ganatantr kaa samarthak tha tathaa anya logon ko bhi vah swatantraaa kaa paath padhaata tha
 Thus he remained the forerunner of Italy's struggle for independence

 Hence, the patriots tried to achieve independence

 He was imprisoned in Senona prison for almost a year
 jail se mukti ke baad usne ‘‘yuvak-italy’’ naamak sanstha kaa gathan kiya, jisase desh main raajnneetik jagriti ai
 Its member numbers continued to grow
 1833 i
 main yang-italy ke sadasyon kii sankhya 60 hajaar ho gayi
 He said that new ideas spread only when they are watered with the blood of the martyrs
 vah yuvakon ke netritv ko mahatvapurn maanata tha
 He was unhappy with the then system of the country and thought of a way to improve it
 usne desh kii janata ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki hamaari pratishtha or unnati avaruddh he
 We have a wonderful ancient tradition, but we do not currently have a national existence
 iske liye usne austria ko doshi bataaya
 Therefore, he organized against him and proclaimed the need to face him
 is prakaar mejini apane vichaaron se italy kii janata ko rashtriya-ekikaran ke liye protsaahit karata rahaa or unamem deshprem or balidaan kii bhaavana ko kuta-kootakar bharta rahaa
 He himself was a supporter of the republic and he also taught freedom lessons to others
 is prakaar vah italy ke swadhinata ke sangharsh kaa agradoot bana rahaa
 The French Revolution of 1848 also had an impact on Italy
 atah deshbhakton ne swatantraaa praapt karne kaa prayaas kiya
 He did not succeed in this endeavor, but his enthusiasm remained due to the fall of Metternich
 dekhen, victor emanuele dwitiya The ruler of Piedmont, Victor Emanuel, was different from other European rulers
 vah rashtriyata or loktantrwaad kaa samarthak tha
 He was a true patriot, heroic and patient
 usne italy ke ekikaran main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 It was moderate
 uske in vichaaron se prabhavit hokar desh kii janata ne use ek eemaandaar raja kii oopaadhi di
 It became very popular among the public
 kavur unka yogya pradhanmantri tha

 atah yah kahana atishyoktipurna na hoga ki yadi victor emanuel na hota to italy ke ekikaran kaa kaary agar asambhav nahin to kathin jarur ho jaataa
 See, Kamil Benso Kavoor italy ke ekikaran main jis vyakti kaa sarvaadhik yogadan tha, uskaa naam count camilo di caboor tha
 He was an important and skilled diplomatist of his era
 uskaa janm 1810 i
 main turine ke ek jameendaar parivaar main hua tha
 He started his life as a soldier, but later abandoned him
 vah vaid rajasatta kaa samarthak tha or england kii sansadeey pranali se prabhavit tha
 His influence in the country gradually increased
 1848 i
 main vah desh kii sansad kaa sadsy bana
 On the strength of his ability, he became the Prime Minister of Piedmont in 1852 AD
 pradhanmantri banate hi usne peedmant kii unnati kii ore vishesh dhyaan diya
 He was a practical and determined man
 usne paristhitiyon ke anusaar kaary karke italy ke ekkiran ke kaary ko sambhav banaaya
 Cabur believed that unless the state was strong, it would not succeed in its struggles
 isliye sarvapratham usne peedmant ko ekikaran kaa netritv pradaan karne ke liye use majboot banane kaa prayaas kiya
 With a view to strengthening the state, it implemented many reforms
 vyapaar or vyavsaay ke vikaas liye uske dwaara vishesh prayaas kiye gayi
 He gave state patronage to the business, following the policy of "leave open" in the field of trade
 uske maarg-darshan main yatayaat ke sadhano ke vikaas ko majubat banaaya gaya or krishi ke kshetra ko viksit kiya gaya
 Special attention was also paid to the advancement of education
 usne sena or kanoon ke kshetra main bhi naye sudhaaron ko kriyanvit kiya
 Friendly reforms were made in the rules related to the bank
 is prakaar usne prashasan ke sabhi angon ko sudhaar kar rajya ke prashasan ko gatisheel or majboot banaaya
 Due to his efforts, the state of Piedmont grew multifaceted and now it became a strong state
 apni buniyaad ko majboot kar lene ke baad usne sabhi varg ke logon se sahyog praapt karne kaa prayaas kiya
 As a result, leaders like Mezzini and Gariboldi agreed to cooperate with him
 is prakaar rashtriya ekikaran ke kaary main vah bahusankhyak janata kaa sahyog praapt karne main safal hua
 Caboor was a sensible and practical man
 usne yah anubhav kiya ki apane lakshya kii prapti ke liye videsh sahaayta aavashyak he
 Luckily, he also succeeded in this purpose
 vah italy main austria ke prabhaav ko samaapt karne kaa icchhuk tha, kyonki iske bina vah apane uddeshyon ko praapt nahin kar saktaa tha
 It was well understood that if any European state can readily cooperate with Austria, it is France
 atah usne france ko khush karne kaa prayaas kiya
 For this he assisted France in the war of Crimea
 yah yuddh 1854 i
 main purvi samasya ke prashn lekar ladaa gaya tha
 It ended in 1856 AD by the Treaty of Paris
 paris kii sandhi par vichaar-vimarsh karne ke liye jis sammelan kaa aayojan kiya gaya, usamen caboor bhi upasthit hua
 He succeeded in presenting the Italian independence claim efficiently at that conference
 usne desh kii dayaneey sthiti ke liye austria ko jimmedaar tehraate hue italy se uske prabhaav ko samaapt karne kii vakaalat kii
 The arguments he gave influenced Napoleon III, then President of France, and accepted military aid to Italy, in which he had his own political advantage
 usne francisi janata ko apni mahatta se prabhavit karne kii drushti se is kaary main bhagidaar hona aavashyak samajha
 As a result, in June 1858, an agreement was reached between the two at a place called Plambiers, which was as follows- austria ko italy ke niyantran se nikaalane ke liye france italy ko sainik sahaayta degaa, or is sahaayta ke badale italy, nise or sevaay ke pradesh france ko degaa
 Thus the problem of getting foreign aid was also solved
 ab caboor austria ke khilaaf yuddh karne ke liye taiyaar ho gaya
 Having assured assurances from France, Cabour was ready to wage war against Austria
 atah caboor ke ishaare par lombardi auravenesia main austria ke khilaaf vidroh ho gaya
 Given the state of rebellion, Austria understood the imperative of war
 falswaroop 1859 i
 main donon pakshon main yuddh prarambh ha gaya
 The war was on when France suddenly withdrew from its war
 iskaa kaaran tha prashia kaa yuddh main austria kii sahaayta ke liye taiyaar hona tathaa uskaa kharchila hona
 At the same time, Napoleon felt that Italy was not appropriate for France to organize
 aisi sthiti main italy or austria bich jurik kii sandhi ho gayi, jisaki sharten is prakaar thim - Italy was not satisfied with the treaty, as it was hurting Venezia under Austria, yet the attainment of Lombardy was a major achievement in the direction of unification, although the task of unification in the central and south was still intact
 madhya-italy ke rajyon main bhi swatantraaa kii maang jor pakadaney lagi thi
 These states too were now trying to get along with the victim
 1860 i
 main modena, parama or taskani aadi madhya-italy ke rajyon ne janamat dwaara peedmant main milane kaa faisla kiya
 Thus the states of central-italy also became unified
 ab keval dakshin-italy ke rajyon ko sangathit karnaa shesh tha
 The movement to include the rest of Italy in the pied-up was not supported by any foreign power
 yah italian rashtriyata kii apni misaal thi, jiskaa netaa gariboldi tha
 The principal states of South Italy were Sicily and Naples, where the power of the Burvo-dynasty existed
 dekhen, juzappe garibaldi Gariboldi contributed significantly to Italy's national-integration work
 unka janm 1807 i
 main nise main hua tha
 He was educated in the Navy
 vah samudri vyapaar se judaa hua tha
 He was deeply influenced by Megini, which is why he became a partisan of the Republican Party
 sarkaar uske is udaar vichaar se naaraaz thi, isiilie vah giraftaar kar liya gaya
 He escaped to South America to escape punishment
 vahaan anek varshon tak rahakar vah 1848 i
 main punah italy waapas lautaa
 After his failure in the revolution, he went back to America
 vahaan se khub dhan kamakar vah punah italy aayaa
 He kept in touch with Caboor and Victor Emmanuel
 apane netritv main usne lalkurti dal kaa sanghathan kiya, jiske sahyog se vah sicily or neples ko swatantra kar unhen rashtriya-dhara se jodne main safal hua
 Gariboldi did the work of connecting these states into the national stream
 dakshin-italy main sicily or neples do rajya the, jahaan burvo-vansh kaa shashan tha
 The people here revolted against the existing regime and prayed to Gariboldi for cooperation
 jawaab main gariboldi ne apni sena kii sahaayta se june 1860 i
 tak saare sicily par apana adhikaar kar liya
 This work was done easily
 sicily ab peedmant ke rajya main shaamil kar liya gaya
 After this, he also took control of Naples in 1860 AD
 6 sitambar 1860 i
ko sicily or neples kaa shaasha francis dwitiya desh chhodkar bhaag gaya
 He edited both these works, influenced by his love of country and nationalism

 He died in 1862 AD
 18 farvari 1861 i
 ko sansad kii baithak main victor emanuel ko italy kaa shaasha sweekaar kiya gaya
 After this achievement, Kabur died on 6 June 1861 AD
 italy ko ek raashtra kaa rup dene kaa shrey caboor ko he, jisamen mejini, gairaboldi or victor emanuel kaa sahyog ullekhneey tha
 Cabur desired that Rome be the capital of United Italy, but had not yet joined Italy
 iske atiriktvenesia bhi abhi tak austria ke adhikaar main tha
 Thus these two shortcomings were still remaining in the work of unification of Italy
 german rajyon ke ekikaran kaa kaary prasha ke pradhanmantri ke netritv main chal rahaa tha
 For the completion of this work, Prasha made war against Austria in 1866 AD, in which Italy also joined on behalf of Prasha
 antat prasha is yuddh main safal hua
 For this cooperation Italy's state of Italy was received
 oktober 1866 i
 main ise peedmant main mila liya gaya
 The ancient splendor of Rome was a source of pride for the Italians
 ve use naveen italy rajya kii rajdhani bananaa chaahate the par us par abhi pope kaa adhikaar tha
 In 1870, a war broke out between France and Prussia
 aisi sthiti main france ko rome main sthit apni sena ko waapas bulaanaa padaa
 During the period of the reunification of Germany, this war was fought on the plain of Sidan, in which Prasha achieved the ultimate success
 is sthiti ne rome par akraman karne ke liye italy ko anukool avasar pradaan kiya, jiskaa laabh uthaakar usne rome par akraman kar diya
 On 20 September 1870, the Italian commander Kedoni established Italy's authority over Rome
 is prakaar italysiyon kii yah antim ichha bhi purna ho gayi
 On 2 June 1871, Victor Emanuel entered Rome
 italy kii sansad kaa udghaatan karte hue usne kaha, Thus the great work of unification of Italy was completed

 Later, on Ramachandra Deb establishing an independent kingdom in Khurda, the temple and its idols were restored
 
 According to the traditional legend associated with the origin of this temple, the original idol of Lord Jagannath made of Indranil or Sapphire was found under an Agaru tree
 yah itani chakchaundh karne vaali thi, ki dharm ne ise prithvi ke neeche chupaana chaha
 Malwa King Indradyumna saw this idol in his dream
 tab usne kadi tapasya kii or tab bhagwaan vishnu ne use bataaya ki vah puri ke samudr tat par jaye or use ek daaru kaa laththa milegaa
 He should build the idol with the same wood
 raja ne aisa hi kiya or use lakdi kaa laththa mil bhi gaya
 The king then appeared before him as Vishnu and Vishwakarma carpenter artisan and sculptor
 kintu unhone yah shart rakhi, ki ve ek maah main murti taiyaar kar denge, parantu tab tak vah ek kamare main band rahenge or raja yaa koi bhi us kamare ke andar nahin aaye
 On the last day of the month, when there was no sound for many days, the king eagerly peeped into the room and the old artisan came out by opening the door and told the king that the idols were still incomplete, his hands were not yet made
 raja ke afsos karne par, murtikar ne bataaya, ki yah sab daivavash hua he or yah murtiyon aise hi sthapit hokar puji jaayengin
 Then the idols of the same three Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were installed in the temple
