 The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group began work on the new standard in 2004; At that time the World Wide Web Consortium was focusing on the futuristic development of XHTML 2

 2009 main, W3C ne exchatimal 2

 The working group published the first public working draft of the specification on 22 January 2008
 vinirdesh kaa kaam ek jari kaary he or kai varshon tak iske aisa hi rahane kii ummid he, haalanki puure vinirdesh ke antim anushansi str tak pahunchne se pehle hi achtmal5 ke kuch hisson ke samaapt hone kii ummid he tathaa brouzaron main unako lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 According to the W3C timetable, it is expected that HTML5 will reach the W3C recommendation by 2010

 yah ek nai parichayatmak line ke saath aata he jo ki ek SGML dastavej prakaar kii ghoshnaa,, jaisaa dikhaai detaa he, jo ki standard-complaayent rendoring mod ko shuru karata he
 HTML5 also incorporates other specifications of WHATWG Web Forms 2

 Existing document object model interfaces are extended and documented with real features

 Accept their every condition for this work and in the end take out your work
 amrit pikar tum amar ho jaaoge or tumme daityon ko maarane kaa samarthy aa jaayegaa
 "according to the Lord's order, Indra told Bali about the elimination of nectar from the churning of the sea
 daityaraj bali ne devraj indra se samjhauta kar liya or samudr manthan ke liye taiyaar ho gayi
 The Mandarachal mountain was made a churner and Vasuki Nag a neti
 vasuki ke netra se netag kaa udbhav hua
 Lord Vishnu himself took the Kachhap avatar and placed Mandarachal mountain on his back and became its base
 bhagwaan narayan ne daanav rup se daanvon main or devtaa rup se devataaon main shakti kaa sanchaar kiya
 By giving deep sleep to Vasuki Nag too, he defeated his suffering

 Wise people never believe such a woman, then how are you believing in me? It is good that you all join yourself and take Amritpan
 " On hearing such proverbial words of Vishwamohini, those humble demons, demons and asuras became even more confident in him
 ve bole, "sundari! ham tum par purna vishwaas he
 We will consume Amritpan in the same way you will share
 tum ye ghat le lo or ham sabhi main amrit vitaran karo
 "vishwamohini took the nectar and asked the gods and the demons to sit in separate rows
 uske baad daityon ko apane kataaksh se madahosh karte huye devataaon ko amritpan karaane lage
 The demons became so obsessed with their sarcasm that they forgot to drink nectar
 bhagwaan kii is chaal ko rahu naamak daitya samaj gaya
 He sat down among the gods after making the form of a deity and put the received nectar in the mouth
 jab amrit uske kanth main pahunch gaya tab chandramaa tathaa surya ne pukaar kar kaha ki ye rahu daitya he
 Hearing this, Lord Vishnu immediately separated his head from the neck with his Sudarshan Chakra

 He is the one who gets the sun and the moon due to hatred

 bhautikee ko paribhaashit karnaa kathin he
 According to the opinion of some scholars, this is a science of energy and it discusses the conversion of energy and its material relations
 iske dwaara praakrit jagat or uski aantarik kriyaaon kaa adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Location, time, speed, matter, electricity, light, heat and sound etc
 fall within its periphery
 yah vigyaan kaa ek pramukh vibhaag he
 Its principles are valid throughout science and apply in every part of science
 iskaa kshetra vistrut he or isaki seemaa nirdhaarit karnaa ati dushkar he
 All scientific subjects come under this in a small amount
 vigyaan kii anya shakhayein yaa to sidhe hi bhautik par aadhaarit hai, athwa inke tathyon ko iske mul siddhanton se sambhddha karne kaa praytn kiya jaataa he
 The importance of physics is also more because being the birthplace of engineering and crafts science, it is the basic motivator of all social and economic development of this era
 bahut pehle isko darshan shaastra kaa ang maanakar natural philosophy yaa prakritik darshanashastra kehete the, kintu 1870 isvi ke lagbhag isko vartmaan naam bhautikee yaa physics dwaara sambodhit karne lage
 Gradually this science kept progressing and at this time seeing the rapid pace of its development, even the leading physicists are surprised
 dhire-dhire isse anek mahatvapurn shakhaon kii utpatti hui, jaise rasinic bhautikee, tara bhautikee, jeevbhautikee, bhubhautikee, nabhikeey bhautikee, akashiya bhautikee ityadi
 The main principle of physics is "law of conservation of energy"
 iske anusaar kisi bhi dravyasamudaay kii urja kii maatra sthir hoti he
 It is not possible to increase or decrease this quantity by internal actions of the community
 urja ke anek rup hote hai or uskaa roopantaran ho saktaa he, kintu uski maatra main kisi prakaar parivartan karnaa sambhav nahin ho saktaa
 According to Einstein's theory of relativity, mass can also be converted into energy
 is prakaar urja sangrakshan or dravyaman sangrakshan donon siddhanton kaa samanvay ho jaataa he or is siddhant ke dwaara bhautikee or rasayan ek duusare se sambhddha ho jate hai
 Physics can be broadly divided into two parts
 1900 isvi se purv jo bhautik gyaan arjeet kiya gaya tha or tatsambandhi jo niyam tathaa siddhant pratipaadit kiye gaye the, unka samavesh chirsmmat bhautikee main kiya gaya
 The inspirations of the ideology of that time were Galileo and Newton
 chirsmmat bhautikee ko mukhyat: yantriki, dhvaniki, ooshmaa, vidyutchumbakatv or prakaashiki main vibhajit kiya jaataa he
 These branches are the cornerstone of engineering and craft science and elementary education in physics is started from them only
 1900 isvi ke pashchaat anek krantikari tathy gyaat hue, jinako chirasmmati bhautikee ke dhaanche main baithaana kathin he
 The branch of physics that originated in studying these new facts and solving their clues is called modern physics
 aadhunik bhautikee kaa dravyasanrachana se sidhaa sambandh he
 Atomic elements, nuclei and basic particles are their main subjects
 bhautikee kii is naveen shakha ne vaigyanik vichaardhaara ko naveen or krantikari mode diya he tathaa isse samaajik vigyaan or darshanashastra bhi mahatvapurn rup se prabhavit hue hai
 'currently solid state physics is known as modern physics where we reads about construction and energy of material
 There are some other branches but Electronics is the latest
