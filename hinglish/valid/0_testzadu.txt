 As Mughal power declined and the power of the emperors decreased
 ve dhire-dhire pehle apane jagiradaaron ke kathputle or antat unke qaidi banate gaye, saath hi saath avadh or shaktishaalee va adhik swadhin hota gaya
 Its capital was Faizabad
 mogul samrajya ke sabhi muslim praanton or adhinsthon main avadh kaa shahi parivaar sabase nayaa tha
 His descendants descended from Saadat Khan, a Persian diler, who was originally from Khorasan region of Persia
 mughalon kii seva main kai koraasaani the, adhiktar sipaahi the or unke safal hone par kaafii daulatmand hone kii ummid rakhi ja sakati thi
 Saadat Khan became the most successful of this group
 1732 main unhen avadh praant kaa jagirdaar bana diya gaya
 He was first given the title of Pahl Nazim, which means Governor, but he was soon made the Nawab
 1740 main nawab ko vazeer arthath mukhya mantri kaha jane laga or iske baad unhen nawab vazeer ke naam se janaa jane laga
 In practice, these titles were hereditary, although on paper they were an offering from the Mughal emperor and confessing loyalty to him
 har saal ek nazar dilli bheji jaati thi or shahi parivaar ke sadasyon kii badi izzat hoti thi: balki do to 1819 ke baad lakhanu main hi rahete the or unhen bade adab ke pesh aayaa jaataa tha
 It is a pity that freedom from the Mughals to a great extent did not mean that the Nawab could govern as he wished
 vastav main ek swami kaa sthaan jagah duusare ne le liya tha
 As the East India Company based in Calcutta, the British had been eyeing the wealth of Awadh for a long time
 is praant main dakhlandaazi ke bahaane khojna koi mushkil nahin tha
 The most painful from Awadh's point of view was the invasion of Bengal by Shuja-ud-daula, after which he also ruled Calcutta for some time
 lekin 1757 main plasi tathaa 1764 main baxur kii ladaai main angrezon kii jeet ke baad nawab puri tarah matiamet ho gaye
 After the war ended, Awadh had lost a lot of its land
 phir bhi satahi taur par hi sahi, dushman dost ban gaye or british sansad main, sampurna bharat main east india company ke pramukh mitra ke taur par nawab vazeer ke taareef ke pul baandhe gaye
 The Darmian Nawab of many years lost his freedom by doing little
 angrez fuj kii suraksha or yuddh main sahaayta kaa kharch chukaane ke liye avadh ne pehle chunaar kaa kila or phir banaras or ghazipur ke jile or phi elahabaad kaa kila de diya
 During this period, the cash assistance given by the Nawab to the company also increased
 1773 main nawab ne lakhanu main british resident sweekaar karne kaa aatmghaatee kadam uthaaya, isaki badaulat videsh niti par sara niyantran company kaa ho gaya
 Soon, despite being formally respected by the Nawab, the actual ruler became a resident
 shujauddula ke putr asafuddaula 1775 main rajdhani faizabad se lakhanu le gaye or unhone lakhanu ko bharat ke sabase rais or chamchamaate shaharon main se ek bana diya
 He is said to have carried out the transfer to avoid his mother's strictures
 lakhanu jaise shahar kii qismat kisi paristhitiyon ne banaai! Nawab Asaf-ud-daula was a compassionate and sensitive ruler, he built many buildings and encouraged the arts
 bhul bhulaia va nikat ke masjid sahit unhone bada imambada banwaaya, ise banavaane kaa mukhya kaaran tha sookhe ke samay apni praja ko rojgaar dilvaanaa
 The Rumi Darwaza also reflects their architectural consciousness
 unke putr, vazeer ali, ko hi apane pitamah dwaara lakhanu main british resident swikaarne ke faisale kaa sabase zyaada afsos hua hoga
 He was removed from the throne by the Governor General in 1798, pretending that there was doubt as to whether he was in fact Asfuddaula's son, but perhaps the real reason for his removal was that he was moving towards autonomy
 unhone asafuddaula ke bhai saadat ali khan ko tajposh kiya
 Saadat Ali Khan managed very well in financial matters, but still did a lot of construction, including Dilkusha, Hayat Baksh and Farhat Baksh and the famous Lal Baradari
 iske baad se uttaradhikaar ke liye yah vansh dilli ke bajaay kalakatta kii ore munh taakane laga
 The assassination of a British resident by Wazir Ali, a remover in Benares in 1798, provided further excuse for interference and Lord Wellesley took full advantage of it
 1801 kii sandhi ke anusaar nawab ko apni fuj kaa tyaag kar ke uske bajaay ek angrezon ke netritv vaali sena kaa baari kharchaa dena padaa
 The southern Doab was given away and the rest of Allahabad and other areas became part of British India
 tees saal main avadh ne apni aadhi zamin angrezon ko de di thi
 In lieu of these concessions, the Nawab demanded open exemption in the rule of the rest of the region, so that there was no scope for the advice and intervention of the British
 lekin isamen dikkat yah thi ki unke nirdeshon kaa kriyanvayan karne ke liye angrezi fuj kii hi zarurat padati
 Wellesley also had another trick: the treaty had a clause under which the administration system should be "based on and in line with the advice of the officers of the venerable company"
 yah dhara yun to nuksandeh nahin lagati thi, par isi ke jariye angrezon ne antat avadh kaa adhigrahan kiya
 From 1819 onwards activities in Awadh would go on
 saadat ali ke dehanth ke baad unke putr gaazi masanad par baithe or unhone ud-deen kii oopaadhi lee, jiskaa arth hota he dharm ke rakshak
 The British formally conferred upon him the title of King, although this was a period when he was completely dependent on the British
 nepal yuddh ke liye unhone angrez firangi ko 20 lakh rupye kaa udhaar diya or aadhe udhaar kii vaapasi ke taur par yuddh ke ant main nepali tarai angrezon se praapt kii - yah himalay parvatamala ke pehle maujuud ek keechad vaala jangal tha
 Some thought the deal was not good, but eventually the Terai produced a lot of valuable wood

 He also built Mubarak Manzil, Shah Manzil and Hazari Bagh
 yahan unhone jaanwaron kii ladaaiyon ke khelon se lakhanu ko pehali baar parichit karaayaa
 But his son Nasiruddin, who succeeded him to the throne, was attracted to the British, but not to justice, freedom, democracy, etc
, but to his clothes, food and, regrettably, the drinking habit, There were some bad English companions around him
 nasiruddin, is swabhaav ke baavjood kaafii lokapriy raja the or unhone ek khagoleey centre, taronvali kothi bhi banavaai, jisamen kai nazaakat vaale upkaran the
 It was maintained by an English astronomer
 unki maut ke baad ek or uttaradhikaar yuddh hua, jisamen angrezon ne jor diya ki saadat ali kaa ek or putr, mohammad ali gaddi par baithe
 Mohammad Ali was a just and popular ruler, and under him Lucknow briefly regained its old glory
 lekin ve gathiya se peedit the
 He died in 1842 and his son Amjad Ali became the ruler, his tendency was more towards the religious and religious world, which led to the loosening of the administration
 amjad ali ke baad waajid ali shah aae, ve kavi, gayak, kala ke kadradaan or lakhanu se mohabbat karne vaale the
 It has been written about him, "they are engrossed only in pleasuring the private senses
 unka saarvajanik maamalon main koi rujhaan nahin he or ucch pad ke kartavyon or zimmedaariyon se unhen koi lenaa dena nahin he
 They live only among singers, eunuchs and women, have been like this since childhood and are expected to remain so till the end
 " This description of Wajid Ali Shah was used as an argument for the takeover of Awadh by the British
 yadi waajid ali shah ke khilaaf bad-intazami kaa ilzaam sach tha, to iske liye angrez bhi nawab ke baraabar zimmedaar the
 From the 1780s onwards he had more control over the Prashan and finances of Awadh
 saath hi, angrezon dwaara nawab se lagaataar dhan kii maang se avadh kaafii nirdhan ho chukaa tha
 The British eventually found an excuse to implement the 1801 treaty clause and in 1856 the Governor General Lord Dalhousie was perfectly suited for this task
 avadh kaa adhigrahan hua, waajid ali shah ko kalakatta main matiaburj main lagbhag bandi hi bana diya gaya, haalaanki ye angrezon kii yojana main nahin tha
 The stage for the biggest revolt against the British power in India had been set

 Nowadays the above definition of centrifuge has become more elaborate, according to which any such machine, which is designed for this particular purpose, that the substances in it can be placed under a central, continuous effect of centrifugal force, is called centrifuge
 apkendritra main padaarthon kaa pruthakkaran vibhinn ghanatv ke kaaran hota he
 Centrifuge produces centrifugal force, which is similar to the force of gravity
 kendrabhimukh bal kaa upyog aise anek prakramon ko twarit karne main prayukt kiya ja saktaa he, jo saamanyat: gurutvkarshan ke apekshaakrit alp bal par nirbhar karte hai
 Centrifuge has been used in India and other countries for a long time
 dahi tathaa doodh ko mathkar makkhan nikaalane kii kriya kendrabhimukh bal par nirbhar karti he
 The scientific definition of centripetal force is based on Newton's famous law of force and speed
 newton ke is niyam ke anusaar mukt avasthaa main, gatisheel padaarthon main, saral rekha main chalane kii pravriti hoti he
 Therefore, if such a moving substance is operated to move on a curved path, then that substance exerts force against that conducting, or controlling substance, or object
 iske falswaroop gatisheel padaarth main us vakrapath kii sparsh rekha kii disha kii ore chal padane kii nirantar pravriti hoti he
 For example, it is seen in common experience that an object traveling in a circle travels forcefully away from the cruising center
 balpreyas kii yah disha paribhraman vrutt ke sparshajya path kii ore hoti he
 Therefore, an increase in the angular velocity of the revolutions, the weight of the object or object, or the radius of the revolutions of the object increases the centrifugal force
 apkendri bal kaa ghurnan vrutt ke ardhavyas tathaa vastu ke bhaar se krmanupaat hota he, jabaki iskaa koniya veg ke varg se anupaat hota he
 The doubling of the number of rotations per minute of the centrifuge leads to a quadruple increase in the centrifugal force
 isi prakaar apkendritra kii gati main das guni vruddhi se apkendri bal main sau guni vruddhi ho jaati he
 In the act of centrifugation, the centrifugal force acting on an object, or producing an effect, is often directly compared to the weight of the object
 is aadhaar par apkendri bal ko gurutv ke gunaj rup main vyakt kiya jaataa he
 For gravity, the letter g is considered a symbol, so the centrifugal force is written in multiples of g for short
 yadi apkendritra main koi vastu 600 ghurnan prati minute kii gati se ghurnan kar rahi ho tathaa ghurnanvrutt kaa ardhavyas 3
84 inch athwa 10 centimetre ho, to is paristhiti main janit honevaala apkendri bal gurutv kaa 41 guna hota he
 In modern and special types of centrifuge, centrifugal force of gravity can be generated a million times
 aadhunik apkendrit dhaatunirmit ek aisa paatr hota he jisamen ghurnan karanevaala bhaag vidyunmotor kii sthir dhuree se judaa hua hota he
 Thus, the rotating portion of the centrifuge starts to rotate at the speed of the vibrometer as the Vidyumotor moves
 ghurnan kii gati vighut kii dhuree ke ghurnan ke samaan hoti he
 In the past, rotating in centrifuge was done by hand
 aajkal bhi gharelu upyog main apkendritra ke ghurnan ke liye shaareerik shram kaa upyog hota he
 In the modern ultra-fast rotating subcenter, the wind turbine is being replaced in place of the vibrator
 apkendritra ke ghurnan karanevaale bhaag ko roter kaha jaataa he
 Its shape is like a bowl, or inverted bowl
 isamen drav athwa anya vastu ko apkendritra nalee main, athwa sidhe katori main, apkendran ke liye rakhaa jaataa he
 In centrifuge work, unnecessary and noxious vibrations do not occur in the centrifuge, it is necessary that the rotor supplied by the object is fully balanced
 iske liye vastu ke sampurna bhaar ko ghurnan dhuri ke chaaron ore samaan rup se vitarit rakhana padataa he
 Under ideal conditions, the resultant of the original forces from this arrangement is equal to zero
 apkendran main dravon kii, visheshkar aise dravon kii jinamein thos padaarth ke sookshm kan nilambit hon athwa jinamein amishraneey drav kii golikaay athwa donon hi vidyaman hon, apkendran pravriti vishesh mahatv kii hoti he
 Separation of the three items from the emulsion made of solid particles, water and oil can be done easily
 apkendran main utpann honevaale apkendri bal kii tulana main gurutv bal atyant alp hota he
 In the field of centrifugal force, the fluid material tries to reverse at a greater distance from the rotation axis, causing the fluid to lie in the same thickness near the outer edge of the rotating vessel of the centrifuge
 is prakaar paatr main aksh se lekar drav tak samaan rup main failaa hua mukt sthaan utpann ho jaataa he, jo ki rambhaakar hota he
 Thus, by the action of centrifugation, the suspended micelles with a higher density than the suspending fluid are collected in the periphery of the vessel and the suspended micelles of lower density than the suspending fluid are collected at the site of the vessel
 uparyukt pruthakkaran kitna shidhra hoga, yah kendrabhimukh bal kii tivrata, nilambit karanevaale drav tathaa nilambit sookshm kanon ke ghanatv ke antar, drav kii shyanta, nilambit sookshm kanon ke aakaar tathaa pariman or kanon kii sandratha tathaa anek vaidyut prabhaar ke str par nirbhar karata he
 Centrifuge has many industrial uses
 isse vibhinn vastuon kaa pruthakkaran hi nahin varan kapadon ko sukhaane jaise kaary bhi kiye jate hai
 Pipes and tubes of different thicknesses are formed from molten metals using centrifuge force
 apkendritra upyog chini ke kaarkaanon main chini ke crystalon se jal ko dur karne main kiya jaataa he
 Unwanted amount of water is extracted from it in the manufacture of ammonium sulfate-like fertilizer
 doodh se makkhan apkendritra se pruthak kiya jaataa he
 Nowadays industrial factories use continuous flow centrifuge in which separation is going on continuously
 jaev vigyaan evam rasayan kii prayogshaalaon main apkendritra ek anivaary upkaran ban gaya he
 In the medical field, it has become possible to isolate extremely microscopic viruses and other bacteria using centrifuge
 rasinic vishleshan main ati teevr ghurnanvaale apkendritra ke upyog se ati sookshm kanon ke avsaadan kii gati tathaa avsaadan samyavastha kaa anumaapan sambhav ho sakaa he
 Centrifuge rotating in excess of 20,000 rotations per minute is commonly called ultrasentrifuge, or rapid centrifuge
 aise apkendritra jaev vigyaan, chikitsa tathaa rasayan se sambandhit anveshan kaaryon main vishesh mahatv ke hai

 After being isolated for years, the Hurriyat Conference indicated to contact the Indian government in November 2000 following the announcement of a one-day ceasefire by the Indian government
 lekin donon pakshon ke apane-apane rukh par ade rahane se aisa nahin ho sakaa
 The goal of establishing the separatist coalition Hurriyat Conference is to achieve the goal of secession of Kashmir through political means
 isaki sthapana 9 march 1993 ko kii gai thi
 Indian officials believe that the Hurriyat Conference represents extremist organizations operating in Jammu and Kashmir

 job satisfaction naukari se santushti apane kaam ke prati ek vyakti kii ravaiya ko darshata he
 1) Organizational factors: The five major organizational factors that contribute to an employee's attitude are pay for promotion, policies of opportunity, nature of work, organization and working conditions: 2)kaam karne kii sthiti: ek karmchaaree ke kaam kii paristhitiyon shaareerik aaraam ke saath sangat hai or kaha ki ek acha kaam naukari se santushti ke liye yogadan karte hai
 Temperature, humidity, ventilation, lighting and noise, working hours of the workplace and adequate equipment equipment are features that affect work satisfaction
 3)samooh kaarak:samooh karkon par prabhaav chalaanevaale samooh aakaar or paryvekshan main shaamil hai
 Size: It is true that long group sizes reduce the level of satisfaction
 jab aakaar bad jaati he, tab bhagidaari or saamaajik sambandhon main kami ke liye avasar he
 So as the ability of members to identify with the performance of the group
 More members means discord, conflict and groups within groups
 in sabhi sadasyon kii santushti ke liye shubh sanket nahin he
 Supervision: The perceived quality of supervision is another determinant of job satisfaction
 santushti jab ucch ho jaataa he tab log apane paryvekshakon,se vishwaas karte hai,ki ve adhik sakasham hai man main apane sarvottam hit he or garima or sammaan ke saath unhen upachaar karte he
 Communication is another aspect of supervision
 ve apane paryvekshak ke saath jab aasaani se samvaad karne main sakasham hai tab sadasyon kii santushti ke ucch ho jaataa he
 4) Wages: Wages play an important role in job satisfaction
 is vajah do kaarnon se he
 First, money is an important tool to meet the needs of one: and two, employees often see pay for them as a reflection of management's concern
 karmchaaree ek bhugtan pranali chaahate hai jo saral, nishpaksh or unki ummiido ke saath he
 Salary is seen as appropriate, based on job demand, personal skill level, and community pay standards, when satisfaction is likely to result
 5)prachaar:prachaar ke avasaron naukari se santushti ko prabhavit karte hai
 This desire to promote responsibility, independence, status and such involves changes in paid, job content, is generally strong among employees
 ek theth sarkari sanghathan main ek ausat karmchaaree padonnati ke avasaron ko nijee kshetra main behatar kar rahe hai, haalanki unke puure seva main do yaa teen pronnati paane kii ummid kar sakate hai
 It is no surprise that the employee takes promotion as the ultimate achievement in his career and realizes, he feels extremely satisfied
 6)kaam kii prakruti : adhikansh karmchaariyon ko naukariyon par bauddhik chunautiyon chaahate hai
 These characteristics make the job mentally challenging
 bahut kam chunauti vaali naukari boriyat paidaa karti he
 But the challenge creates feelings of frustration and failure
 sharton ke tahat par udaaravaadi chunauti karmchaariyon ko khushi or santosh kaa anubhav dilaataa he
 7) Organizational Policies and Procedures: Organizational policies include the basics for effective promotion, transfer of people, overseas work, layoffs and rewards systems, motivational methods, job based pay versus skills based, closing
 1)utpaadakta : santosh or utpaadakta ke bich jo sambandh he vah nishchit rup se sthapit nahin he
 However long-term job satisfaction leads to increased productivity
 duusari ore kaam ke pradarshan se naukari se santushti ho sakti he or duusare daur nahin hota he
 The employee who does his work well gets both internal and external rewards which will lead to his satisfaction
 ek bura pradarshak uski kshamta ke bare main bura lag rahaa hoga or kam puraskaar praapt karegaa
 He will be less satisfied with his work experience
 haalanki ucch utpaadakta or adhik spasht rup se naukari se santushti kii ore jaataa he jiske tahat kuch sharton rahe hai
 One condition is employees internal and external rewards are contingent on their productivity
 The second condition is external rewards being distributed equally
 asmaan vitaran mehnat or puraskaar ke bich kareebi sambandh ke bare main karmchaaree ko samajhane main vifal rahata he
 2) Job Satisfaction and Employee Turnover: High employee turnover is of great concern to employers as it disrupts normal tasks causing morale problems for those people and increases the cost involved in selection and replacement training
 niyokta karmchaariyon ko apni naukari par santusht mahasoos karne ke liye koshish karata he kaarobaar kam karne ke liye
 It has been demonstrated that workers who have relatively low levels of job satisfaction are the most likely to leave their jobs
 haalanki karmchaariyon kii vaapasi vyavhaar kuch karkon dwaara sanshodhit kiya gaya he
 Loyalty in the organization is one such
 kuch karmchaariyon ko kitne bhi asantust honge kahin or kaam karte khud ko kalpana bhi nahin kar sakate hai
 3) Satisfaction and Absence: The correlation of satisfaction to absence has also been proved to be decisive
 jo shramikon asantusht hai ve beemaari yaa nijee vyavsaay kii vajah se "maansik swasthya" din lag jane kii sambhaavna he
 Satisfaction is low when absenteeism is high
 logon ko apni naukari se mahatvapurn hai ki lag rahaa he, jo karne ke liye degree unki anupasthiti par ek madhyasthata prabhaav he
 Employees who watch for their regular attendance tend to think their work is important
 yah ucch naukari karte hue santosh jaruri kam anupasthiti main parinaam nahin hoga ki yaad rakhana mahatvapurn he iske alaava, kam santushti ucch anupasthiti ke bare main laane kii sambhaavna he
 4) Satisfaction and security: Poor safety practices are a negative consequence of low satisfaction levels 
 jab log apni naukari sanghatan yaa paryvekshakon se niraash ho jate hai jab ve durghatnaon kaa anubhav karne ke liye adhik uttaradaayi hai
 One underlying reason for such accidents is frustration
 agar oparator saavdhaan nahin hota to usko kai haath chot pahunch sakati he
 5) Satisfaction and Job Stress: Job stress is the body's response that threatens any work-related factor to upset individuals balance
 tanaav kaa saamana karne kii is prakriya main karmchaariyon bheetar rajya main parivartan aati he
 Prolonged stress can cause serious illnesses in the employee such as heart disease, ulcer vision, lower back pain and muscle pain
 chronic naukari asantushti naukari tanaav kaa ek shaktishaalee strot he
 They can see no satisfactory short-term solution to avoid this form of stress

 tantra, parampara se jude hue aagam granth hai
 The meaning of the word Tantra is very wide
 tantra-parampara ek hindu evam buddha parampara to he hi, jain dharm, sikh dharm, tibet kii bone parampara, daao-parampara tathaa japan kii shinto parampara main paayi jaati he
 In the Indian tradition, any systematic text, theory, method, device, technique or methodology is also called a system
 hindu parampara main tantra mukhyatah shakt sampradaay se judaa hua he, uske baad shaiva sampradaay se, or kuch seemaa tak vaishnav parampara se bhi
 In the Shaivite tradition, the speakers of the Tantra texts are generally Shiva
 buddha dharm kaa vajrayan sampradaay apane tantra-sambandhi vichaaron, karmkandon or sahitya ke liye prasiddh he
 The literal origin of Tantra is believed to be like this - "tanoti Triati Tantra"
 jisase abhipraay he – tanana, vistaar, failaav is prakaar isse traan hona tantra he
 Tantra traditions are found in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain philosophies
 yahan par tantra sadhana se abhipraay "guhya yaa gudh saadhnaaon" se kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The Tantras are considered to be a post-vedic work that flourished around the middle of the first millennium
 sahityak rup main jis prakaar puraana granth madhyayug kii darshanik-dharmik rachanaayen maane jate hai usee prakaar tantron main pracheen-akhyan, kathanak aadi kaa samavesh hota he
 In terms of its content, these can also be called encyclopaedia of religion, philosophy, creation, ancient science etc
 europea vidwaanon ne apane upanivishvadi lakshyon ko dhyaan main rakhte hue tantra ko 'gudh sadhana' yaa 'sampradayik karmkand' bataakar bhatakaane kii koshish kii he
 By the way, the number of books is thousands, but the main systems are 64
 tantra kaa prabhaav vishwa str par he
 Evidence of this is the scriptures of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Tibetan etc
 religions
 bharat main pracheen kaal se hi bengal, bihar or rajasthan tantra ke garh rahe hai
 This scripture is divided into three parts - agam, yamal and main tantra
 vaarahi tantra ke anusaar jisamen sristi, pralay, devataaon kii puja, sab kaaryon ke sadhana, purashcharan, shatkarm- saadhan or chaar prakaar ke dhyanyog kaa varnan ho, use aagam kehete hai
 In which the description of creation, astrology, daily work, order, sutra, varbheda and Yugadharma is called Yamal
 or jisamen sristi, lat, mantranirnay, devataaon, ke santhaan, yantranirnay, tirth, ashram, dharm, kalp, jyotish santhaan, vrath-katha, shouch or ashauch, stri-purush-lakshan, rajdharm, daan- dharm, yuvadharm, vyavhaar tathaa aadhyatmik vishyon kaa varnan ho, vah tantra kehalaata he 
 The theory of this scripture is that in Kali Yuga there is no result of Vedic mantras, chants and yagyas etc
 is yug main sab prakaar ke kaaryon kii siddhi ke liye tantrashaastra main varnit mantron or upayon aadi se hi sahaayta milti he 
 The principles of this scripture are kept very secret and a man has to be initiated first to take his teachings
 aajkal praayah maaran, ucchatan, vaseekaran aadi ke liye tathaa anek prakaar kii siddhiyon aadi ke saadhan ke liye hi tantrokt mantron or kriyaaon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he 
 This scripture is primarily of the devotees and its mantras are often meaningless and monolithic
 jaise,— hnin, clin, shrin, sthin, shun, kru aadi 
 The Panchamakara of Tantrikas - alcohol, meat, fish, mudra and maithun - and Chakrapooja are famous
 tantric sab devataaon kaa pujan karte hai par unki puja kaa vidhaan sabase bhinn or swatantra hota he 
 In Chakrapuja and many other pujas, tantric people treat alcohol, meat and fish in a great manner and worship women like Dhobin, Tallin etc
 naked
 yadhyapi atharvaveda samhita main maaran, mohan, ucchatan or vaseekaran aadi kaa varnan or vidhana he tathaapi aadhunik tantra kaa uske saath koi sambandh nahin hai 
 Some believe that modern system has been propagated in India during and after Kanishka's time
 chini yatri phahiyaan or huensang ne apane lekhon main is shaastra kaa koi ullekh nahin kiya he 
 Although it cannot be said with certainty when Tantra was propagated, there is no doubt that it is not older than 4th or 5th century AD
 hinduon kii dekhadekhi baudhon main bhi tantra kaa prachaar hua or tatsambandhi anek granth bane 
 Hindu tantrik calls them 'upatantar'
 unka prachaar tibet tathaa china main he 
 It is also written in Varahi Tantra that sages like Jaimini, Kapil, Narada, Garga, Pulastya, Bhrigu, Venus, Jupiter etc
 have also created many subsystems
 vyakaran shaastra ke anusaar 'tantra' shabd ‘tan’ dhaatu se bana he jiskaa arth he 'vistaar'
 It is interpreted in the 'kaayak Agam' of Shaiva Siddhanta, Tanyate Vyashyate Gyanam Anen, Iti Tantram tantra kii nirukti ‘tan’ or ‘trai’, in donon dhaatuon ke yoga se siddh hoti he
 This means that the system, in its overall sense, extends the knowledge as well as conducts those who conduct it
 tantra-shaastra kaa ek naam 'aagam shaastra' bhi he
 It is said about this- vachaspati mishra ne yoga bhashya kii tatvavaisharadi vyakhya main 'aagam' shabd kaa arth karte hue likhaa he ki jisase abhyuday or nickshreyas ke upaay buddhi main aate hai, vah 'aagam' kehalaata he
 Another form of the scriptures is called ‘nigam’
 nigam ke antargat veda, puraana, upanishad aadi aate hai
 It deals with knowledge, karma and worship etc
 isiilie veda-shastron ko nigam kehete hai
 The scripture which describes the form of remedies used to practice that form, is called 'agam'
 tantra athwa aagam main vyavhaar paksh hi mukhya he
 The system emphasizes actions and rituals
 ‘vaarahi tantra’ main is shaastra ke jo saat lakshan bataae hai, unamem vyavhaar hi mukhya he
 These seven traits are- tantra kaa saamaanya arth he 'vidhi' yaa 'upaay'
 There is no principle or method
 siddhanton ko lekar matbhed ho sakate hai
 Deities and disputes may also occur, but there is no disagreement regarding the law
 doobane se bachane ke liye tairkar hi aana padegaa
 If you want electricity, you will have to convert coal and water molecules
 daudane ke liye paanv aage badhaane hi honge
 If you want to climb a mountain, there is no choice without stepping towards the height
 yah kriyaayein 'vidhi' kehalaati hai
 The practicality is main in a system or prophecy
 tantra kii drushti main sharir pradhan nimitt he
 Without it the higher peaks of consciousness cannot be reached
 isi kaaran se tantra kaa taatpary ‘tan’ ke madhyam se aatma kaa ’traan’ yaa apane aapkaa uddhaar bhi kaha jaataa he
 This meaning is true only to a extent
 vastav main tantra sadhana main sharir, man or kaay kalevar ke sookshmatam staron kaa samanvit upyog hota he
 It is certainly true that the system gives as much importance to the body as to the mind, intelligence and mind
 karmkand or puja-upasna ke tareeke sabhi dharmon main alag-alag hai, par tantra ke sambandh main sabhi ekamat hai
 All religions believe that eternal energy is hidden within the human being, only five-seven percent of it comes into use, the remaining part remains unused
 sabhi dharm–sampradaay is baat ko ek mat se sweekaar karte hai va apane hisaab se us bhaag kaa maarg bhi bataate hai
 Followers of those religions often employ similar methods to awaken their hidden powers
 unamem jap, dhyaan, ekaagratha kaa abhyaas or sharirgat urja kaa saghan upyog shaamil hota he
 This is the representation of the system
 tantrokt matanusaar mantron ke dwaara yantra ke madhyam se bhagwaan kii upasna kii jaati he
 To clarify the subject, even if the scripture talks about the principle, otherwise three quarters of the Agama-scriptures teach only the methods
 tantra ke sabhi granth shiv or parvati ke samvaad ke antargat hi prakat hai
 Goddess Parvati questions and Shiva preaches a method while answering them
 adhikansh prashn samasyapradhan hi hai
 Even if a question has been asked in relation to the theory, Shiva describes the method only after giving his answer in few words
 aagam shaastra ke anusaar 'karnaa' hi jaananaa he, anya koi 'jaananaa' gyaan kii paribhaasha main nahin aata
 There is no answer or solution until something is done, not entered into cultivation
 tantron kii vishay vastu ko mote taur par nimna taur par batalaaya ja saktaa he- The influence of both the Samkhya and the Advaita thought of Vedanta is reflected in the Tantra texts
 tantra main prakruti ke saath shiv, advait donon kii baat kii gayi he
 But special emphasis has been laid on 'shakti' in Tantra philosophy
 tantra kii teen paramparaayen maani jaati hai – There are four ideologies of Shaiva Agams - bhartiya parampara main aagmon kaa atyant mahatvapurn sthaan he
 Ancient temples, statues, buildings, and religious-spiritual methods have been determined by them
 pracheen taur par shaiva siddhanth ke antargat 28 aagam tathaa 150 upagamon ko mana gaya he
 According to Shaivism, in principle, Shiva is the only conscious element and nature is the root element
 shiv kaa muladhar shakti hi he
 It is through strength that one attains bondage and salvation
 pramukh granth shivasutra he
 In this, the attainment of knowledge is said to be done only by Shiva's affidavit
 jagat shiv kii abhivyakti he tathaa shiv kii hi shakti se utpann yaa sambhav he
 This philosophy is also called 'trik' philosophy because it accepts the existence of Shiva, Shakti and Jiva three
 is darshan kaa mahatpurna granth “vachanam” he jisase abhipraay he ‘shiv kii ukti’
 This philosophy considers traditional and Shiva completely all factors, destroyers, initiators
 isamen jatigat bhedbhaav ko bhi nahin mana gaya he
 The Guru tradition has special significance under this philosophy
 aagam kaa mukhya lakshya 'kriya' ke upar he, tathaapi gyaan kaa bhi vivaran yahan kam nahin he
 According to 'varahitantra' Agama is conferred with these seven traits: creation, status, holocaust, devartharna, omnipotent, purcharan, shaktarma, means and meditation
 'mahanirvana' tantra ke anusaar kaliyug main praani medhya tathaa amedhya ke vichaaron se bahudhaa hin hote hai or inhen ke kalyanarth bhagwaan maheshwar ne aagmon kaa upadesh parvati ko swayan diya
 In terms of Shaiva Agam dvaita, Shaktivishtvaita and Advaita, three distinctions are also considered
 aagmik puja vishuddh tathaa pavitra bhartiya he
 28 Shaivagam is known as Siddhanta
 'bhairav aagam' sankhya main chaunsath sabhi mulat: shaivagam hai
 It discusses from dvaita bhava to supreme advaita bhava
 kirnagam, main likhaa he ki, vishwasristi ke ananthar parameshwar ne sabase pehle mahagyaan kaa sanchaar karne ke liye das shaivo kaa prakat karke unamem se prayek ko unke avibhakt mahagyaan kaa ek ek ansh pradaan kiya
 This undivided great knowledge is called Shaivagam
 veda jaise vastav main ek he or akhand mahagyaan swaroop he, parantu vibhakt hokar teen athwa chaar roopon main prakat hua he, usee prakaar mul shivagam bhi vastut: ek hone par bhi vibhakt hokar 28 aagmon ke rup main prasidv hua he
 Each of these Agamadhara has a tradition
 vaishnav samhita kii do vichaardhaarayen milti hai – vaikhanas samhita, tathaa pancharaatr samhita
 Vaikhanas Samhita - This is the Vaikhanas ideology of the Vaishnava tradition
 vaikhanas parampara praathmik taur par tapas evam saadhan parak parampara rahi he
 Pancharatra Samhita - Pancharatra means 'system of Panchanishas'
 pancharaatr parampara prachintaur par vishwa ke udbhav, sristi rachana aadi ke vivechan ko samahit karti he
 It shows the incorporation of the beliefs of Sankhya and Yoga philosophies

 It has been said to have 108 texts
 vaishnav parampara main bhakthi vaadi vichaardhaara ke atirikt shakti kaa siddhanth bhi samahit he

 Thus the system of governance was completely corrupt, autocratic, passive and exploitative

 As a result, there was a lack of uniform law code in the country and prevalence of different laws in different areas

 Regarding France's chaotic situation, u can be said that "there was no question of bad system, there was no system at all
" " The causes of the revolution can also be seen under social conditions
 francisi samaaj visham or vighatit tha
 That society was divided into three classes / states
 pratham stats main padri varg, dwitiya stats main kuleen varg evam tritiy stats main jansadharan shaamil tha
 The clergy and the nobility enjoyed wide privileges while the public was devoid of authority
 kisaanon kii sankhya sarvaadhik thi or inaki dasha nimna or sochneey thi

 yahi kaaran tha ki france kii kranti main unka mukhya yogadan rahaa or unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 There were also some economic complaints from the middle class

 They wanted a free environment for their trade business
 iske liye unhone kranti ko netritv pradaan kiya
 In this way we can say that the French Revolution was the result of the struggle of two conflicting factions of French society
 ek taraf raajnneetik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee or duusari taraf aarthik drushtikon se prabhaavshaalee varg the
 To dominate the politics and government of the country, struggle between these two classes was inevitable

 The demand for a meeting of the estate general was eventually called for passing resolutions for the abolition of privilege, and the revolution coincided with the meeting of the estate general in 1789, so the economic plight of the time was considered the most important cause of the French Revolution is

 It was in this context that he gave the principle of "separation of power", according to which the three principal organs of governance, the executive, the judiciary and the administrator, were advised to be placed in separate hands
 usne england ke saraakar ko adarsh bataaya kyonki vahaan sanvaidhanik rajtantr tha jisase vahaan nagarikon ko swatantraaa thi
 Thus his ideas that Montescue hurt France's autocratic state system through segregation of power became so popular that six editions were published in three years of 'the Spirit of Lodges'
 yahaan dhyaan rakhane kii baat yah he ki montescue ne na to kranti kii baat kii or na hi rajtantr ko samaapt karne kii usne to sirp nirankush rajtantr ke dosha ko ujagar kiya or sanvaidhanik rajtantr kii baat kii

 All classes were excited to hear the news of the meeting of the States General
 kulina ummid thi ki is baithak main ve un visheshadhikaron ko praapt kar sakenge jo lui 14waan ke samay usne chhin liye gaye the
 The people of the middle class believed that they would be able to formulate progressive policies in their favor
 kisaanon ko aashaa thi ki vah saamanti visheshadhikaron ke viruddh aawaaj uthaakar apane adhikaron ko surakshit kar unke shoshan chakra se mukt ho sakenge
 In this way no significant portion of the French population was ready to support the French monarchy
 estats general ke adhiveshan main matadhikaar paddati ke mudde par tritiy state evam anya state ke bich vivaad ho gaya
 Voting was said that each state would be considered to have only one vote
 is prakaar visheshadhikaar praapt varg kaa do tathaa jansadharan kaa ek hi mat hota he
 Representatives of the general public, ie 'third State' opposed this voting system because it would have reduced them to a minority even though they were many
 tritiy state yah chahta tha ki teenon shreniyon ke pratinidhi ek saath baithkar bahumat se nirnay le lekin padri evam kuleen varg alag-alag baithak chaahate the
 Therefore, the Third State boycotted the meeting of the States General and declared itself as a national assembly, representing the entire nation and convened its meeting in the nearby tennis court

 From the point of view of convenience of the study, the revolution can be seen by dividing it into the following four stages
 is charan main paris kii bheed ne bastil ke kile par niyantran sthapit kiya
 This is how the revolution started
 vastutah bastil kaa kila nirankushta evam atyaachaar kaa pratik tha or iske patan se puraatan vyavastha kaa gahari chunauti mili
 The incident also affected the rural areas of France and the villagers set fire to the records of feudal taxes

 So, on 4 August 1789, an overnight session of the National Assembly took place in which all the privileges were abolished by framing laws
 is tarah england or america ko samaapt kar diya gaya
 The important function of the National Assembly was to create a constitution
 atah rashtriya sabha hi samvidhan sabha kahalaayi or 26 agast 1789 ko samvidhan sabha ne maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa kii
 The Constituent Assembly declared human rights as its ideals and objectives
 is ghoshnaa main samanta ke siddhanth par bal diya gaya or kaha gaya ki chunki sabhi manushya samaan rup se paidaa hote he atah unhen samaan adhikaar milane chahie
 These rights included freedom, property security and the right to protest against tyranny etc
 is prakaar samvidhan sabha ne aadharbhoot siddhanton, swatantraaa, samanta va janata ke prabhutv kii ghoshnaa kii
 The right to property was repeated in the manifesto
 is adhikaar se kisi ko vanchit nahin kiya ja saktaa tha
 The National Constituent Assembly seized church property and attempted to reduce the church's control over the public
 is sandarbh main carch ko rajya ke adheen le aayaa gaya or use rome ke pope ke prabhaav se mukt kar rashtriya carch ke rup main tabdeel kar diya gaya
 a "civil Constitution of Clergy" was created to secure the clergy's loyalty to the state
 jiske anusaar padariyon ko rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath leni padati thi or janata ke dwaara unka chunaav hota tha
 The pope and some priests opposed the move
 jin padariyon ne rajya ke prati nishtha kii shapath grahan ki ve “jurar” kehalaae jabaki shapath nahin lene vaale “non jurar” kehalaae
 This law created an atmosphere against the revolution because so far the small clergy had supported the revolution
 ab ve isse alag ho gaye or kuch padri desh chhod videshon main chale gaye or vahaan europe main kranti ke viruddh prachaar karne lage
 The National Constituent Assembly prepared a written constitution for France, and this constitution was approved by Louis XVI in 1791
 samvidhan main do baton par bal diya gaya-ek, rajya kii saarvbhaum shakti janata main nihit he or doosraa, shakti kaa pruthakkaran rajya evam janata ke hit main he
 Although the system of governance remained monarchical, the king's powers were limited

 The citizens were divided into two parts, active and inactive, for the election of members of the administration and the franchise was given only to the active citizens

 The National Assembly changed the administrative structure of France
 pracheen praanto ko khatm karke sampoorn desh ko 83 departmenton main vibhakti kiya gaya
 These departments were divided into Cantan and Comune

 Radicals were also divided into two classes - Jirondist and Jacobian
 isi bich france kii kranti kaa bhay europe ke anya deshon ke bhi failane laga
 The clergy and oligarchs who had fled from France to other regions of Europe spread the spirit against the revolution
 duusari taraf france ke krantikari anya deshon main bhi krantikari siddhanton ko prachaar chaah rahe the
 As a result, other kings of Europe became suspicious
 parinamswaroop krantikari france or europe ke anya deshon kaa aapasi sambandh bigadaa
 Austria, despite the refusal of the revolutionaries, had allowed the refugees of the French monarchy to remain with them
 atah vyavasthapika sabha ne apairal 1792 i
 main austria ke viruddh yuddh kii ghoshnaa kar di, kintu france kii sena buree tarah parajeet hui
 The defeat convinced the French people that the king had told Austria all the secrets of France's military power and security
 atah raja ke prati janata kaa ravaiya ugr ho gaya
 In these conditions, in support of the French monarchy, Prasha and Austria declared that the French people should obey the king, otherwise we will take action against them
 is tarah france kii kranti ne europe main yuddh kii sthiti utpann kii
 The announcement made the people of France more enraged and surrounded the king
 raja bhagkar vyavasthapika sabha kii sharan main pahunchaa
 It was now considered that the assembly should be dissolved; a re-election takes place, a new administrative assembly is formed and it gives its decision on the future of monarchy
 isi ke saath vyavasthapika sabha ko samaapt kar diya gaya or vayask matadhikaar ke aadhaar par rashtriya kanveshan kaa gathan hua
 The first session of the National Convention was held on 21 September 1792
 isamen jacobiyan evam jirodist dal pramukh the
 The Jacobians were disciplined and organized
 paris kii bheed par inkaa prabhaav tha
 The main leaders in this were - Dante, Robspier, Heater, etc
 duusari taraf jirondist the- ye shikshit or susanskrit log the
 He had more book knowledge
 faltah ye vyaavhaarik raajnneetijna nahin the
 The prominent leaders were - Isnar, Madame Roland, Brisco etc
 yahaan samajhane kii baat yah he ki donon hi gut ganatantr ke himachati the, videshi shaktiyon ke viruddh yuddh kaa samarthan karte the
 The difference was only in form
 vastutah jirodisto ne france main udaaravaadi sthaan grahan kar liya tha
 He believed that the revolution had gone far ahead and should end
 ve or adhik saamaajik samanta laane ke viruddh the
 He emphasized more on freedom
 udhar jacobiyan log samanta par adhik jor dete the tathaa nimna virgon ke prati sadbhaavpurn ravaiya rakhte the
 The National Convention had three major problems - foreign invasion, the king's presence, and civil war
 sitambar 1792 main francisi sena ne belgium par adhikaar kar liya or dakshin main nise or sevoy bhi uske adhikaar main aa gaye
 Holland, Austria, Prasha and England were terrified by these victories
 krantikariyon ne 1792 main ghoshnaa bhi kar di ki france kaa ganatantr swatantraaa, samanta or bandhutav kii bhaawanaaon par aadhaarit he or in bhaawanaaon kaa prasar karnaa vah apana kartavya samajhataa he
 France will implement revolutionary principles and seize the property of priests and nobles in the places where it will dominate and whichever country opposes it will be considered as the revolution
 is ghoshnaa se europe ke nirankush rajtantri desh bhaybheet ho gaye or ab france kii kranti france kii na hokar puure europe kii ho gai
 Therefore, the European countries united to stop the spread of revolution and a faction of England, Holland, Austria, Prussia was formed against France
 is gut ne kai jagahon par france ko parajeet kiya
 Consequently, France's defeat in a foreign war became a major problem before the National Convention
 neshnal kanvension ne ek prastaav paarit kar rajtantr ko samaapt kiya or ganatantr kii sthapana kii
 The king was tried for treason and sentenced to death
 raja ke vadh ke prashn par jirondixton kii niti spasht nahin thi
 He was opposed to the monarchy but was referring to the referendum on the question of slaughter
 iske vipareet jacobiyans kaa mat tha ki raja kaa deshadroh siddh ho chukaa he
 Therefore, he should be given death sentence
 atantah 21 janvari 1793 ko lui 16waan faansee par chadha diya gaya
 The National Convention also faced the problem of conflict between the Jacobians and the Zirodists
 vastutah yuddh ke kaaran france aarthik sankat se ghir gaya tha, keemten bad gai thi jisase kanveshan ne raahat dene ke liye vidhaan banaaya, amiron se karj vasuulne kaa niyam banaaya
 These steps were opposed by the Jirandists
 jab jacobio ne paris kii bheed or commune kii sahaayta se kanvension par akraman kar satta par adhikaar kiya or jirondixto ko giraftaar kar aatank ke rajya kii sthapana kii
 With the establishment of the 'state of Terror', France once again fell into disarray
 robspier ke netritv main isaki sthapana kii gai thi
 In this revolutionary, public security was established and anyone who worked against the Jacobs would be punished with death penalty
 robspier ruson kii vichaardhaara se prabhavit tha
 According to which "common desire" is universal desire
 robspier ne satta par niyantran rakhane ke liye virodhiyon ko “gilotin” par chadha diya
 So all the people became suspicious about their lives
 antat july 1794, main robspier kaid kar liya gaya or faansee de di gai isi ke saath aantak ke rajya kii samaapti hui
 The 'state of Thermidorians' was followed by the state of terror
 udaaravaadi thermidorian netaaon ne desh kii satta sanbhali or aantak rajya kii vyavasthaaon ko bhang kiya, jacobiyans ko avaidh ghoshit kiya
 During the rule of terror, control over the price and remuneration imposed was lifted
 jisase keemten punah bad gai, sattebaajon kaa prabhaav bad gaya or pratikriya swaroop vidroh hue lekin in vidronho ko dabaa diya gaya
 Phase III-1794-99 - Rule of "directory" In fact the National Convention formulated a constitution and entrusted the executive responsibility to the 5-member "board of Directors"
 mandal ke sabhi sadasyon ke adhikaar baraabar the
 Each member alternately presided for three months
 prayek varsh ek sadsy kaarykaal samaapt hona tha or uske badale duusare sadsy kii niyukti kii jaani thi
 In this way, the Directory of Rule in France began after the National Convention which lasted from 1795 to 1799
 atan main nepolian ne diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar diya
 This directory rule was disorganized, sad
 sanchaalak mandal ko sashastr senaaon ke niyantran evam senadhyakshon kii niyukti, france kii ore se sandhi karne yaa yuddh karne ke adhikaar praapt the
 The main problem before the Board of Directors was the problem of war, on the other hand the members of the directory were inexperienced, inept and corrupt
 atah diarectory ke shashan kaal main tarah-tarah kii gadabadi faili, bekaari badi, vyapaar thapp pad gaya or uski videsh niti bhi kamjor rahi
 In such a situation, the people of France felt the need for a ruler who could establish peace inside and outside the country and defeat foreign powers
 is kaal main nepolian ne sainya vijayon dwaara france ke sammaan ko sthapit kiya or antat diarectory ke shashan kaa ant kar satta par niyantran sthapit kiya
 In 1799, Napoleon ended the Directory's rule and became the first Council of France and declared himself Emperor in 1804 and thus Napoleon's dictatorial imperialist rule began
 europe main france hi vah desh he jisane kranti ke madhyam se puraatan vyavastha ke patan ko sunishchit kiya
 The impact of this revolution was not limited to Europe
 isane samast vishwa ko prabhavit kiya
 The slogans of revolution spread freedom, equality and fraternity throughout Europe
 ek taraf isane jahaan rashtrawaad, janatantrwaad jaisi nai shaktiyon ko panpane kaa mauka diya to duusari taraf aadhunik taanaashaahee or sainikwaad kii neenv bhi daali
 The effects of the French Revolution can be understood under the following points: francisi kranti kii prakruti ko kranti ke aadarshon, kranti ke netritv, kranti kii pragati, kranti ke dauraan laae gaye parivartanon or vishwa par pade prabhaavon ke prakaash main samajhe jane kii jarurat he
 From this point of view, the revolution was a revolution that was started by the elite, then later it came into the hands of the middle class
 kuch samay ke liye yah krantikari tatwon ke prabhaav main rahi or ant ek sainik taanashaah ke saath hua
 In this way, the French Revolution started like a huge river that started from the high mountain peak and crossed several small mountains in the path, at a rapid, if slow, speed
 1789 main hui francisi kranti ko ek burjua kranti ke rup main dekha ja sakaata he
 The leadership in the first phase of the revolution was in the hands of the bourgeois elements of the Third State
 madhyavargeey netritv ne nijee sampatti ko dhyaan main rakhte hue kuch siddhanth bhi banaaen
 In fact, the end of feudalism was declared but feudal rights were not only abandoned, but only after compensating the landlords, the peasants could be relieved of any responsibility
 maanavadhikaron kii ghoshnaa main madhyavargeey prabhaav dekha ja saktaa he
 The right to property was placed in the category of natural rights of man which is related to the protection of bourgeois interests
 isi prakaar vayask matadhikaar kii baat to kii gai kintu samvidhan main “naagarik” shabd kaa atyant sankuchit arthon main prayog kiya gaya
 Citizens were divided into active and passive citizens
 sakriy naagarik ve the jo apni kam se kam teen din ke aay kii rakam pratyaksh kar ke rup main adaa karte the or sirp inhen hi mat dene kaa adhikaar tha
 The ability of property to be representative was also made a basis and it was only the rich who could participate in political activities and this meant that the rich people belonged to the middle class
 is tarah francisi kranti ne janm par aadhaarit bhedbhaav ko nasht kiya parantu uske jagah pracheen samantvaad ke badale dhan par aadhaarit nae samantvaad kaa prabhutv hua
 During the revolution, the revolutionaries talked about the loans taken by the autocratic government, but no one talked about forgiving those loans
 iskaa kaaran tha yah rin sarkaar ko burjua varg ne diya tha
 Similarly, the government seized the property of the church but it was not distributed to the landless
 jameenon ko sarvaadhik oonchi keemton par bechaa gaya or is jameen ko kharidne kii kshamta madhyavarg ke paas thi
 The French Revolution ignored the interests of the workers and discouraged the labor movement
 kranti ke dauraan shramik varg ne mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai thi kintu burjua netritv ko uski badhati sthiti manjuur nahin thi
 Therefore, the National Assembly re-enacted the laws made in the autocratic monarchy era
 jiske tahat sabhi shramik sangh sambandhi kaaryon par pratibandh laga diya gaye or gildon ko gaiyrkanoonee ghoshit kar diya gaya
 In the National Assembly, the bourgeoisie dominated and the Jirondist and Jacobians also belonged to the bourgeoisie
 yadhyapi jacobiyan sarvhaara varg ke hit kii baat karte the parantu aatank ke rajya kii sthapana main burjua hiton ko hi upar rakhaa gaya or shramikon pratikriyaaon ko dabaane hetu sena kii sahaayta lee gai
 Middle-class interests were also given prominence in directory governance
 sanchaalak mandal ne jis dwisadani vidhayika kaa nirmaan kiya uske sabhi sadsy madhyavargeey buddhijivi the
 The bourgeoisie effect can also be seen on Napoleon's reforms
 usne burjua hiton ko sangrakshit rakhte hue apni vidhi samhita main sampatti ke adhikaar ko surakshit rakhaa, kulinon ko apekshaakrit vyapak adhikaar die tathaa uske vyapaarik or vanijyik sudhaaron kaa phayda madhyavarg ko hi mila
 In this way, middle class elements are seen in the form of revolution
 kintu puure kranti or uske prabhaav ke vishleshan se yah spasht hota he ki kranti main madhyavargeey tatwon ke saath krishak, majdoor, mahilaon kii sahamaagita thi
 In this way, it was not just a middle class revolution, but it can be seen as a popular revolution
 francisi kranti ek vishwavyaapee charitra ko liye hue thi
 The revolutionaries declared human and civil rights in 1789, under which it was said that being born equal from birth, all human beings should get equal rights and this is for all nations, for all human beings, for all time and for example
 Are for the world
 yah ghoshnaa sirp france ke liye nahin varan har jagah ke un sabhi logon kii bhalaai ke liye hai jo swatantra hona chaahate the tathaa nirankush rajtantr evam saamanti visheshadhikaron ke boj se mukti paanaa chaahate the, banaaya gaya tha
 In 1792 AD, the English hero named Kompene was awarded the title of French citizen by the National Assembly and was also elected a delegate to the National Convention
 isi prakaar kranti ke dauraan yah vichaar aayaa ki kranti ko sthaayee or sudrudh rakhane ke liye ise europe ke anya deshon main bhi vistaarit kiya jaaen
 It envisages a war in which French forces enter neighboring countries and meet local revolutionaries and overthrow the monarchy and establish republics
 france kii kranti maatr ek rashtriya ghatana nahin thi apitu siddhanton- swatantraaa, samanta evam bandhutav ke naaron se sampurna europe gunj uthaa
 The effects of the revolution were so far-reaching that all of Europe was covered by it
 isi sandarbh main kaha gaya “yadi france ko zukam hota he to samast europe cheenkta he
 " france kii kranti roosi kranti ke samaan suniyojit nahin thi
 In fact, the Russian Revolution was planned by the Bolsheviks and its aim was to establish the rule of the proletariat by gaining power, but the French Revolution was a victim of events and circumstances from the beginning to the end and the events did not happen in the way that the revolutionaries wished but rather the events gave the revolutionaries Forced to change his path
 stats general kii baithak main yadi tritiy state kii baat anya stats ne maan lee hoti to kranti kaa ruukh doosraa hota
 Similarly, the state of terror and the rule of the directory also did not run in a planned manner
 is drushti se yah kranti avyavasthit thi
 The degeneration of erstwhile French society was also an important factor in the origins of the French Revolution
 puraa samaaj visheshadhikaar praapt or adhikaar viheen virgon main vibhakt tha
 The condition of the peasants was bad due to the burden of taxes, on the other hand they had to suffer exploitation by the tyranny of the feudal and the intervention of the church
 in sthitiyon ne kranti ko raah dikhaai or krantikariyon ne isi asamanta ke viruddh aawaaj buland kii or swatantraaa, samanta tathaa bandhutav kaa naaraa diya
 It was only during the revolution that the end of feudalism was announced, the privileges were abolished

 In fact, during the revolution, a dictatorial government or dictatorship was established under the leadership of Robspier and later the Nepalese also established the dictatorship
 france kii kranti vahaan kii puraatan vyavastha main vyaapt tamaam vikrutiyon, visangatiyon evam buniyadi dosha ke viruddh ek shashakt pratikriya thi
 The revolution paved the way for democratic governance in France by ending French society based on autocratic monarchy inequality, luxury clergy and the crisis facing economic insolvency
 is drushti se ise drushti se ise pragatisheel kranti ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he Not only this, the declaration of human rights, the slogan of freedom, equality and fraternity and the ideology of nationalism made the whole world aware of the slogan of nationalism and the ideology of nationalism
 italy evam germany ke ekikaran kii bhaavana ko protsaahan mila
 The issue of segregation of religion and politics first arose during this revolution
 rajya or raajnneeti dharm se alag kiye gaye
 France's state revolution enjoys special importance in world history, it is considered an important event in human history
 isamen na keval france balki europe ke jan jivan main amulya parivartan laa diya isamen shadiyon se chali aa rahi saamanti vyavastha ko nasht kar aadhunik loktantric vyavastha kaa maarg praast kiy
 The autocracy of the monarchy came to an end and people breathed peace in the democratic atmosphere
 is samay hamaare saamne yah prashan uthta he ki 1789 i
 main kranti kaa sutrapat anya europe deshon main na hokar pehle france main hi kyon hui
 a study of European nations of the 18th century showed that the condition of France at that time was worse than that of other Europe nations
 nirankush rajtantr suvidha yukt varg or karon ke asaahneey bhaar se dabaa hua tha
 Ordinary classes were present in almost all European countries
 kuch rajyon kii sthiti to france se bhi adhik vikrut thi prasha, austria or rus aadi france se bhi adhik vikrut the
 French farmers were happier than other European nations
 saadhaaran varg kii sthiti anya europe rajyon main or bhi kharaab thi
 Nevertheless, the revolution took place not in these countries but in France first
 iskaa pramukh kaaran yah tha kii france log apni sthiti ke prati jaagruk the
 It is not a necessary condition for revolution that its explosion takes place in the same countries where people are victims of atrocities, incest and exploitation
 samrudh or unnat desh main bhi kranti ho sakati he
 Provided that its residents feel that injustice is being done to them
 france kii janata is anyaay ko mahasus kar rahi thi
 Wanted to get away from it
 vahaan aise anek darshanik or lekhak paidaa hue jinhone apni lekhnee ke dwaara in kashton kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrishti karaayaa anya europee deshon kii badtar sthiti ke baavjud france main sarvapratham lui solvaan ke khilaaf kranti hui
 There were many reasons for this revolution which are as follows
 frasisi saamanton kaa badla hua swarup or kisaano kii unnat avasthaa- Such was the reason for the advanced state of French peasants and the changed nature of feudalism
 jiske chalate france main sarv pratham rajyakranti hui
 Farmers in the European country were still in a state of gloom
 parantu france ke kisaan swatantra ho chuke the
 They did not own their own land and own their own land in spite of such convenience and feudal services, they had to pay a large part of their income in the form of feudal tax
 or phir bhi uski sthiti acchhee dhi
 They used to buy some land by saving money and the hunger to buy land was constantly increasing, there was a problem of feudalism and unemployment, so they were thinking of removing the feudal occupations, so they got strength under the leadership of the middle class
 And in 1789 AD they revolted
 france main udaar nirankushta kii parampara kaa abhaav- Other European countries also had autocratic monarchies
 parantu vahaan ke samraaton ne samaynusaar apni nirankushta main kami kar di thi
 King Fredirak of Prasha was the great enlightened administrator of his time
 jiskaa anusaran europe ke anya desh rus germany, italy, spain aadi ne kiya
 In due course of time, he tried as much as possible to improve the economic, physical and other fields
 parantu france main is tarah ki udaar nirankushta kaa abhaav tha
 The kings there were doing nothing for the benefit of the people
 balki adhik tex vasulanaa or janata kaa shoshan karnaa unki niti ban gai thi
 Therefore, the French people were fed up with it, so the people of France wanted to end the autocratic monarchy
 maadyam varg kii jaagarukta- The reason for the first revolution in France was the middle class there
 anya deshon main bhi madhyam varg thi parantu ve france kii tarah saanskriti, dhani evam shikshit nahin the
 He lacked strength
 ve raja ke khilaaf baghawat karne kii soch nahin sakate the
 The middle class people in France were dissatisfied with their emperors for many reasons
 or apni raksha ke liye raaj satta par ankush lagane ke liye utawala ho rahe the
 Other European states lacked this type of situation
 anya deshon main netritv karne vaala koi nahin tha france main jaagruk madhyamvarg taiyaar tha
 Therefore, revolution first took place in France itself
 kulinvarg kii anupayogita- The elite Vigyan was given the first privilege to help the king in running the rule
 or ve janaata kii raksha bhi karte the
 But slowly - 2 started doing this work for the king's employees
 falat: kulinon kii upyogita samaapt ho gai
 Yet there was no cut in its prerogative
 isliye kisaan or madhyam varg ke log kulinvarg se ghrinaa karne lage
 This was not the case in other countries
 vahaan abhi bhi kulinon ki payogita bani hui thi
 The influence of philosophers 18 veen shatabdi main sampoorn europe main boudik halchal machi hui thi
 Philosophers, thinkers, scientists were present in all countries
 parantu unamem mukhya france ke vichaarak the
 Who presented the psychological basis of the revolution
 unhone samaaj main vaypt buraaiyon kii ore logon kaa dhyaan aakrisht karaayaa or muk janata ko vaani di
 Such an attempt was not being made in other countries
 montegu, waltare ruso aadi vichaarkon kaa kaary kshetra france hi tha
 Austria, Prasha and Russia did not have such thinkers
 europe ke anya deshon main logon kaa unki vaastavik sthiti bataane vaala or unamem santosh paidaa karne vaala darshanikon kaa koi varg nahin tha
 This was a major reason for revolution in France itself
 raajnneetik sahabhaagita kaa abhaav- When the middle class became aware in England, they were given the opportunity to participate in the politics of the country
 parantu france ke saath aisi baat nahin thi
 The middle class of France was quite dissatisfied with its emperors
 unki apeksha kii jaati thi
 Despite being educated, they did not have a reputation like the nobles
 unhen france kii raajnneeti main bhaag lene kaa avasar nahin diya jaataa tha
 Therefore, he dissented and raised the slogan of revolution
 ayogy raja tathaa prashasan main bhrashtachar- The political system of France was centralized but the kings were inept
 prashasan main bhrashtachar kaa bolbalaa tha
 In other countries of Europe, autocratic rule was broken but kings were eligible and they had full control over governance
 france kaa madhyam varg is prashasnic bhrashtatar ko mahasoos kar rahaa tha
 And so he was ready to revolt
 rashtriya bhaavana kaa udai- At this time, national sentiment began to rise rapidly in Europe
 sampoorn europe main france hi ek aisa desh tha jahaan ek raashtra bhaavana kaa purnat: abhaav tha
 Due to this, there was a revolution in France for the first time

 Tillane! Use my name carefully, you will discredit it
" Rani decided to take part in the drama by disguising it and she says that she will handle the matter on her own
 Although she recognizes Viola in disguise as Thomas Kent, she does not expose him, but declares that Juliet's character is being played by a young man, Thomas Kent
 tathaapi rani bhi ek kanoonee shaadi ko todane main asamarth he
 Queen Elizabeth asks "thomas Kent" to capture Viola so that she can live with Wessex in Virginia
 The Queen also says that Romeo and Juliet have accurately portrayed true love, so Wessex will pay Shakespeare fifty pounds, which is the right amount to buy a stake in Chamberlains Men
 iske baad rani "kent" ko nirdesh detii he ki vah shakespeare ko "agali baar twealth nit ke liye kuch adhik khushnuma" likhane ke liye kahe
 viyola or shakespeare apni niyati se majaboor ho kar alag ho jate hai
 Inspired by Viola and his final separation, Shakespeare begins his new story Twilight Night, and What You Will with a sinking ship on which the only creature to survive is a woman "whose soul is larger than the sea
" " samudr tat par uske chalane ke ek drishy ke saath prishthbhumi main mukhya kirdaar ke rup main shakespeare kii awaz ke saath film kaa ant hota he, "vah sadaa ke liye meri heroin rahegi or uskaa naam hoga 


 viyola", jise vah ek tyajya shashakt yuva mahila ke rup main darshata he va jo ek yuva ladke kaa bhesh badal kar ilyria ke duk ke pyaar main pad jaati he
 The original idea of shakespeare in Love came to mind in the 1980s by screenwriter Mark Norman
 unhone nirdeshak aid jvik ko patakatha kaa praaroop dikhaaya
 julia roberts patakatha se aakarshith ho kar viyola kaa kirdaar nibhaane ke liye sahamat ho gai
 However, Jewick did not like Norman's screenplay and hired Tom Stoppard to improve it)
 1991 main universal pikchars main jvik ke saath nirdeshak ke rup main film kaa nirmaan kaary shuru hua, lekin set or paridhaan nirmaan ke daur main the, shakespeare kaa paatr abhi tak nahin chunaa gaya tha, kyonki julia roberts kaa kahana tha ki keval dainiel de-louis hi is bhoomika ko nibhaa saktaa he
 day-lewis was uninterested, and when Roberts failed to convince her, she withdrew from the film six weeks before filming
 nirmaan kaary main badlaav kaa daur aa gaya tathaa jvik duusare studio ko is patakatha ko lene ke liye raji karne main asamarth rahe
 Eventually, Jewick agreed to Miramax, the script, but Miramax was not keen on making him a director, and he opted out of the project, choosing John Madden instead
 Miramax owner Harvey Winstein worked as a producer and successfully convinced Ben Affleck for a smaller role like Ned Eileen
 pehali test screening ke baad film main kaaphi sudhaar kiya gaya
 The parrot scene between Shakespeare and Viola was re-filmed to make it more emotional and a few lines were re-recorded to explain why Viola had to marry Wessex
 The ending was filmed several times, until Stopper suggested that Viola convince Shakespeare that their separation could inspire her next play
 is film main bahut se ection drishyon ke liye mukhya strot romeo and juuliyat he
 Will and Viola played the famous balcony and bedroom scene; Like Juliet, Viola has a cheerful nurse and stays aloof from Will due to her duties
 Furthermore, both lovers are equally "failing in love" - their destiny is ultimately not written to be together
 The film also stars Rosaline with whom Will falls in love at the beginning of the film
 film main prayukt kii gai adhikansh duusari kahaniyaan shakespeare kii vibhinn hasya kathaon tathaa elizabeth ke yug ke anya naatakakaron ke kaam ke hi samaan he : rani dwaara ek aam aadmi kaa bhesh dhaaran karnaa, alag-alag paridhaanon kii sahaayta se bhesh badalanaa, galat pahchaan, talwarbaji, vyabhichaar kaa andeh, "bhoot" kii upasthiti ; doosraa "tum donon ke gharon main vipatti" 
 Christopher Marlowe appears in the film as the lead playwright whom the film's characters consider to be the greatest English playwright of the time — this is true, though also ridiculous
 kyonki film ke darshakon main se har koi jaanata he ki antat shakespeare ke saath kya hoga
 marlo shakespeare ko uske agle naatak ke liye ek kahani detaa he, "romeo and ithel da piret'sa doter" marlo ke doctor faustus ko baar-baar yah kehete hue dikhaaya gaya he: "kya yah vahi cheharaa tha jisane hajaaron jahaaz bheje the / or ilium ke chotirahit tower jalaae the?" John Webster's play with mice as a child refers to the leading figure of Jacobian era playwrights
 uske naatak khun or raktranjit drishyon ke liye jane jate hai, yahi kaaran he ki vah kahata he ki vah titus andronicus ko pasand karata he or isiilie rani dwaara puche jane par vah romeo and juuliyat ke bare main kahata he "mujhe acha laga jab usne khud ko ghayal kiya
 " jab joker vil camp shakespeare se kahata he ki vah naatak main bhaag lenaa chahta he, use bataaya jaataa he ki "yadi vah bhaag legaa to ve seneka kaa majaak udaayenge," ek roman tragedian se sandarbhit he jo apni un vishadpurn or khooni kahaniyon ke liye prasiddh the jinhonen angreji traasad kathaon ke vikaas par atyadhik prabhaav daalaa
 With several signatures appearing relatively obscure, Will is shown repeatedly signing a paper
 yah is tathy se sambandhit he ki shakespeare ke hastakshar ke kai sanskaran maujuud hai or har ek main unhonen apana naam alag-alag dhang se likhaa he
 Shakespeare in Love was sued in 1999 by Fae Kellerman, author of the book The Quality of Mercy
 kelarman kaa daawa tha ki kahani uski pustak se churaai gai he, jo ki ek jasusi upanyaas he jisame shakespeare or ek aakarshak veshbhusha vaali yahudee mahila, ek hatya kii gutthi ko sulajhane kaa prayaas karte hai
 Miramax mocked the claim's similarity by calling it "absurd 


 publicity stunt"
 Upon the film's release, some publications, including Private Eye, found many strong similarities to the film and the 1941 novel No Bed for Bacon, written by Karyl Brahmas and SJ Simon, that also saw Shakespeare fall in love and the inspiration for his later plays Is shown looking for

 At that time the British kingdom had reached the Yamuna and the Phulkians, the king of Egypt, began to assume the dominion of the British state
 angrejon ne ranjitsingh ko is kaary se manaa kiya
 Ranjitsingh did not think it right to fight the British and made a pact that we would not extend our kingdom in front of Sutlej
 ranjitsingh ne francisi sainikon ko bulaakar, uski sainik kaman main apni sena ko vilayati dhang par taiyaar kiya
 Now he started attacking the southern, western and northern parts of Punjab and in ten years extended his kingdom to Multan, Peshawar and Kashmir

 Ranjitsinh changed the kingdom of Peshawar in 1808 AD to the name of his ambitious mother-in-law Sadakore
 kyonki yah angrejon kii agent mahila thi
 Ranjitsingh, after quarreling with his ill-fated mother-in-law, imprisoned him and took control of Hvdni's stronghold

 Ranjit Singh did not want any quarrel with the British Army

 Therefore, he started preparations silently, yet in 1809 AD, he made a treaty with Lord Minto

 Due to the above treaty, the Afghan state of Punjab and Afghanistan were able to terrorize it to some extent

 It is about the year 1812
 punjab par maharaja ranjit singh kaa ecchhatra rajya tha
 At that time, Maharaja Ranjit Singh started a campaign to free Kashmir from the clutches of Atamohammad, the Subedar of Kashmir
 is abhiyaan se bhaybheet hokar atamohammad kashmir chhodkar bhaag gaya
 There was another reason behind the Kashmir campaign
 atamohammad ne mahmud shah dwaara parajeet shahshuja ko shergarh ke kile main kaid kar rakhaa tha
 To get her freed from captivity, her Begum Wafa Begum came to Lahore and prayed to Maharaja Ranjit Singh and said that you kindly release my husband from the captivity of Atma Mohammad, in exchange for this favor, the prized Kohinoor diamond will be presented to you
 shahshuja ke kaid ho jane ke baad vafa begum hi un dinon afghanistan kii shasika thi
 Zaman Shah, the grandson of Ahmad Shah Abdali, who invaded India in the greed to seize this Kohinoor, had his eyes taken out by his brother Mahmud Shah himself in the prison by terrible torture
 jamaan shah ahamed shah abdali ke bete taimur shah kaa betaa tha, jiskaa bhai tha mahmud shah
 Astu, Maharaja Ranjiti Singh himself wanted him to liberate Kashmir from Atamohammad

 His Diwan Mohkamchand surrounded the fort of Shergarh and released Wafa Begum's husband Shahshuja and brought him to Lahore near Wafa Begum
 rajkumaar khadgasingh ne unhen mubarak haveli main tehraaya
 But Wafa Begum delayed the offering of Kohinoor diamond to Maharaja Ranjit Singh as promised
 yahaan tak ki kai maheene biit gaye
 When the Maharaja asked Shahshuja about the Kohinoor diamond, both he and his begum started making excuses
 jab zyada jor diya gaya to unhone ek nakli hira maharaja ranjit singh ko saunp diya, jo johariyon ke pareekshan kii kasuti par nakli sabit hua
 Ranjit Singh was filled with anger and Mubarak Haveli was surrounded
 do din tak vahaan khaanaa nahin diya gaya
 The first of June 1813 was when Maharaja Ranjit Singh came to Shahshuja and then inquired about Kohinoor
 dhoort shahshuja ne kohinoor apni pagadi main chipa rakhaa tha
 Somehow the Maharaja came to know about this
 at: unhone shahshuja ko kabul kii rajgaddi dilaane ke liye "gurugranth sahab" par haath rakhkar pratigya kii
 Then he changed his turban to Kohinoor to make him a "turban-changing brother"
 parde kii oot main baithi vafa begum maharaja kii chaturaai samaj gayi
 Now Kohinoor had reached Maharaja Ranjit Singh and he was satisfied that he had liberated Kashmir
 unki ichha thi ki ve kohinoor heere ko jagannathpuri ke mandir main pratishthit bhagwaan jagannatha ko arpit karen
 He was famous for offering mana gold to Hindu temples

 But his desire to reach Jagannath God could not be fulfilled due to the treasurer of the treasurer Beliram

 Evolution is the change of genetic traits of a biological population with generations
 jaivik aabaadiyon main genetic parivartan ke kaaran avlokan yogya lakshanon main parivartan hota he
 As genetic diversity varies with generations, natural selection makes those traits more common that provide greater success in survival and reproduction

 All individuals have a genetic material in the form of genes
 sabhi shaks ise apane mata-pita se grahan karte hai or apni santan ko dete hai
 The genes of the offspring vary slightly
 iskaa kaaran utparivartan or langik janan ke dauraan maujuuda jeens main pherbadal he
 Due to this, children are slightly different from parents and each other
 agar wo bhinnataayen upyogi hoti hai to santan ke jivit rahane or prajnan karne kii sambhaavna zyada hoti he
 Because of this, the chances of surviving and breeding different individuals of the next generation are not equal
 falswaroop jo lakshan jeevon ko apni paristhitiyon ke zyada anukulit banaate hai, agali pidiyon main wo zyada saamaanya ho jate hai
 These differences keep increasing gradually

 genetic drift ke madhyam se ye nishpaksh genetic utparivartan keval sanyog se aabaadiyon main sthapit ho jate hai or bahut pidiyon tak jivit rahete hai
 In contrast, natural selection is not a random process because it protects the traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction
 prakritik varan or genetic drift jivan ke nity or gatisheel ang hai
 These processes have formed branches of the family tree of life over billions of years

 It is used in many disciplines such as medicine, psychology, bio-conservation, anthropology, forensic science, agriculture and other socio-cultural subjects

 In 1938 he explained how this could be a natural process
 unhone is prakritik prakriya ko prakritik varan kaa naam diya
 The size of a population depends on the amount of resources present in its environment
 varshon tak aabaadi kaa aakaar sthir bana rahane ke liye aabaadi ke aakaar or uplabdh sansadhano main santulan bana rahanaa jaruri he
 More offspring are born than the environment the offspring can shelter
 iske kaaran kisi bhi peedi ke sabhi shaks jivit nahin rah sakate hai
 Therefore, there is always a competitive struggle for the resources necessary for survival
 is se darwin ko ehsaas hua kii uttarjivan keval sanyog par nirbhar nahin karata he
 He realized that survival depends on the individual's differences, or "traits"
