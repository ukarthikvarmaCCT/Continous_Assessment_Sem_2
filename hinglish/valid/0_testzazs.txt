 iske alaanva kuch log dar ke kaaran in baton par vishwaas nahin karnaa chaahaten he
 So let us know once about that Veli family of America and that creepy house
 veli house ek aisa ghar tha jo ki puraane san diegon callirphonia main ekant main banwaaya gaya tha
 This house was designed by Thomas Veli himself and spent $ 10,000 on this house at that time
 veli house kaaphi bada makaan he isamen us samay kii aadhunik sukh suvadhion kii puri vyavastha kii gayi thi
 Welly House was built by Thomas Valley in 1857, Thomas Valley was born in New York, USA in 1823
 thomas kuch din neuyark main rahakar waapas san diongon main aakar bas gayi the or vahiin par unhone apane veli hous kaa nirmaan karavaaya tha
 At that time his wife and three children also came with him to live in this house
 veli house main haadason kii shuruuaat veli ke 18 maheene ke bete juniper thomas ke maut se hui
 Thomas was just 18 months old when he was captured by a high fever and he died
 aapakon bataan de ki veli parivaar ke is ghar main aane se pehle hi thomas maanate the ki is ghar par ruhon kaa kabja he
 It is said that the year he started building this house, the same year a person hanged himself and his soul still revolves around the house
 bete kii maut ke baad is parivaar main kuch saalon ke baad do or betiyon kaa janm hua
 a few years later, Thomas's wife also died of illness
 thomas ke bade bete vilet veli ne george tii barto naam kii ladkee se shaadi kar lee
 The couple got divorced a few days after the wedding and Violet couldn't bear the shock and committed suicide by shooting himself in his room with a chest shot
 vahiin thomas kii duusari beti anna aalia ne jaan twailthi se shaadi kii thi
 Rho, who was already in the house, used to live in the same house and started showing his influence on the Thomas family one by one
 isi bich san jon kii bhi bimaari ke kaaran maut ho gayi
 When this sequence of deaths started, it continued till 1961 and one by one all the members of this house died
 veli hous jo ki apane hi banane waalon kii maut kii vajah ban gaya iske kaaran is makaan ko koi bhi kharidne ke liye taiyaar nahin hota tha
 People believed that whoever buys this house or stays in it will also kill their souls
 aaj bhi is makaan main thomas ko uske kamare main chahal kadami karte mahasoos kiya jaataa he
 The most dangerous scene is when Aaliya decorates her hair in her room, at that time her shadow can be clearly seen in the mirror
 vahiin kuch logon ne ghar ke peeche vaalen kamren main anya sadasyon ke bhi hone kaa abhas kiya he
 The government has now taken over this house
 is ghar main ghost hunters naamak vyavastha ne apana rirsch kiya tha
 a person involved in the research team said that when he was entering this house, it must have been at 1 o'clock at the same time and there was terrible darkness around
 jab wo ghar ke andar pehle kamare main daakhil hua to use laga ki koi mahila jo ki apane haathon main kuch liye hue andar ke kamren kii daravaajein kii taraf ja rahi he
 When that person called him, he looked back and at that time his hair covered his entire face and there was something like a comb in his hands
 us samay jab team ke us sadsy ne us par tarch kii lit di to wo us daravaajein main samaa gayi
 Apart from this, when he went to the Violet's room in the Veli house, he realized that someone was following him and when he looked back, the entire family of Veli was standing behind him
 itnaa dekhakar wo jaldi se vilat ke kamare main ghus gaya jahaan ek aaraam kursi thi jo ki apane aap hill rahi thi
 When he went to the chair, he saw that someone was looking inside the window of danger on which the glasses were placed
 usee vakt wo sadsy daudkar khidki ke paas pahunchaa to wo saaya jo ki khidki se jhaank rahi thi wo neeche kud gayi
 After that he looked at the window panes and he felt that there were blood stains like crowns on the glass
 veli house main rahane vaale jinaki maut ho gayi wo ab is duniya main insaani rup main nahi he lekin unki ruuhe aaj bhi veli house ko chhod nahi paayi he
 You too can easily feel those spirits today
 bas jarurat he thode se himmat or ichha kii
 The government has started Veli House as a museum
 aaj bahut se log veli house main jaakar thomas veli ke parivaar ko mahasoos karaten he
 But the government has restricted some parts of the house

 chetana kuch jeevadhariyon main swayan ke or apane aasapaas ke vaataavaran ke tatwon kaa bodh hone, unhen samajhane tathaa unki baton kaa moolyankan karne kii shakti kaa naam he
 According to science, consciousness is the feeling that arises from the impulses reaching the brain
 in aavegon kaa arth turant athwa baad main lagaaya jaataa he
 The cerebral cortex has been considered the main sense, or principal place of consciousness, since a very old period
 isamen se bhi purvallat ke kshetra ko vishesh mahatv diya gaya he
 But Penfield and Yaspers explain consciousness in a new way
 unke matanusaar chetana kaa sthaan chetak, adhashchetak or upree mastishk ke upree bhaag ke aasapaas he
 They consider these parts of the brain and their combinations to be the highest level of organization of nerves
 purv lalaat kshetra tathaa adhashchetak ke bich bahirgami naadiyon dwaara sangyojan he
 The combination is direct or indirect
 paroksh sangyojan prishth cendrak ke dwaara hota he
 These pulse are also related to pence
 chetana manushya kii vah visheshta he jo use jivit rakhti he or jo use vyaktigat vishay main tathaa apane vaataavaran ke vishay main gyaan karaati he
 This knowledge is called thinking power
 yahi visheshta manushya main aise kaam karti he jiske kaaran vah jivit praani samajha jaataa he
 Man cannot do any of his physical activities unless he has the knowledge that he will be able to do that action
 koi bhi manushya kisi vighatak padaarth athwa ghatana se bachane ke liye apane kisi ang ko tab tak nahin hilaa saktaa, jab tak ki usko yah gyaan na ho ki koi ghaatak padaarth uske saamne he or usase bachane ke liye vah apane angon ko kaam main laa saktaa he
 For example, we can think of a man who is going towards the river
 yadi vah chalate-chalate nadi tak pahunch jaataa he or nadi main ghus jaataa he to vah duubakar mar jayega
 He cannot stop his walk and cannot save himself from entering the river until the knowledge is produced in his consciousness that he has a river and he can walk on land, but cannot walk on water
 can
 manushya kii sabhi kriyaaon par uparyukt niyam lagu hota he chaahe, ye kriyaayein pehle kabhi hui hon athwa bhavishya main kabhi hon
 Human beings can do any work only because of the inspiration arising from consciousness
 chetana or manushya ke charitra main moulik sambandh he
 Consciousness is the special quality that makes a man alive and character is his entire organization through which the reality of his survival is expressed and through which various functions of life are carried out
 kisi manushya kii chetana or charitra keval usee kii vyaktigat sampatti nahin hote
 These are the result of the social process of many days
 prayek vyakti apane vanshanukram ko swayan main prastut karata he
 He finds special types of rites as ancestral property
 vah itihaas ko bhi swayan main nirupit karata he, kyonki usne vibhinn prakaar kii shiksha tathaa prashikshan ko jivan main paaya he
 Apart from this, he also represents other people by himself, because they have had an impact on his life through his example, preaching and oppression
 jab ek baar manushya kii chetana viksit ho jaati he, tab uski prakritik swatantraaa chali jaati he
 Even in such a state, he is inspired by various motivations and inner instincts, but he cannot publish them freely
 vah yaa to unhen isliye sarvatha dabaa detaa he jisase ki samaaj ke duusare logon kii aavashyaktaaon or ichchhaaon main ve baadhak na bane, athwa unhen is prakaar chapet diya jaataa he, yaa kritrim banaaya jaataa he, jisamen unka prakaashan samajavirohi na ho
 In this way, the human consciousness or prudent mind exercises control over his subconscious, or natural, mind
 manushya or pashu main yahi vishesh bhed he
 This type of control is not there in the life of animals, so they do as they want
 manushya chetanayukta praani he, atev koi bhi kriya karne ke pehle vah uske parinaam ke bare main bhalee prakaar soch letaa he
 From the point of view of psychology, consciousness is the element present in human beings due to which he has all kinds of sensations
 chetana ke kaaran hi ham dekhte, sunate, samajhate or anek vishay par chintan karte hai
 Due to this we also feel happiness and sorrow and due to this we make many kinds of decisions and try to get many things
 maanav chetana kii teen visheshtaayen hai
 She is knowledgeable, emotional and functional
 bhartiya darshanikon ne ise sachchidanand rup kaha he
 The views of modern psychologists confirm the said prohibition
 chetana vah tatv he jisamen gyaan kii, bhav kii or vyakti, arthath kriyasheeltaa kii anubhuti he
 When we know a substance, we are aware of its nature, a dear or unpleasant feeling is born towards it and a desire is created towards it, due to which we either bring it closer to us or remove it away from us
 
 chetana ko darshan main swayamprakash tatv mana gaya he
 Psychology has not yet progressed in the form of consciousness
 chetana hi sabhi padaartho ko, jad chetan, sharir man, nirjeev jivit, mastishk snaayu aadi ko banaati he, unka swaroop nirupit karti he
 Then it is indiscriminate to try to explain consciousness through them
 megadugal mahashay ke kathananusaar jis prakaar bhautik vigyaan kii apni hi sochane kii vidhiyaan or vishesh prakaar ke pradutt hai usee prakaar chetana ke vishay main chintan karne kii apni hi vidhiyaan or pradutt hai
 Therefore, the subject of consciousness can neither be thought of by the methods of physics nor can it be used in its work
 phir bhautik vigyaan swayan apni un antim ikaayiyon ke swaroop ke vishay main nishchit mat prakashit nahin kar paaya he jo us vigyaan ke aadhaar hai
 So far, improvisation has been made about matter, power, speed, etc
 abhi tak unke swaroop ke vishay main antim nirnay nahin hua he
 Therefore, it is not rational to expect a final decision about consciousness
 chetana ko achetan tatv ke dwaara samajhaana, arthath usamen kaary-kaaran sambandh jodna sarvatha avivekpurna he
 Psychologists who have tried to explain consciousness as the result of the actions of the root matter, ie those who have considered it to be the result of physical actions, pulsing of nerves, etc
, have eliminated the presence of consciousness
 unhone chetana kii upasthiti ko hi samaapt kar diya he
 This is the result of the contemplation of Pavlaf and Watson sir
 unke kathananusaar man athwa chetana ke vishay main manovigyaan main sochna hi vyarth he
 The subject of psychology should be the visible behavior of man
 chetana ke sharir main sambandh ke vishay main manovaigyanikon ke vibhinn mat hai
 According to some, consciousness is the result of the actions that occur in the large brain of man, that is, the pulsing of some pulse
 yah apane main swatantra koi tatv nahin he
 According to others, consciousness is a self-element and has a relationship with the body, that is, actions in consciousness affect the body
 kabhi-kabhi chetana kii kriyaaon se sharir prabhavit nahin hota or kabhi sharir kii kriyaaon se chetana prabhavit nahin hoti
 According to one belief, the body is just a tool for the functioning of consciousness, which it sometimes uses and never brings
 parantu yadi yantra bighad jaae, athwa tut jaae, to chetana apane kaamon ke liye aapng ho jaati he
 The above opinion has been considered the best in the state of current progress of science by some serious psychological thinkers
 chetana ke teen str maane gaye hai : chetan, avchetan or achetan
 At the conscious level, all the things through which we think, understand and work
 chetana main hi manushya kaa ahambhaav rahata he or yaheen vichaaron kaa sanghathan hota he
 In the subconscious level, there are things whose knowledge we do not know immediately, but can be remembered in time
 achetan str main ve baaten rahati hai jo ham bhul chuke hai or jo hamaare ytn karne par bhi hamen yaad nahin aatin or vishesh prakriya se jinhen yaad karaayaa jaataa he
 The sensations that once remain in consciousness, they sometimes go into the subconscious and unconscious mind
 ye anubhutiyaan sarvatha niskriy nahin hotin, varan maanav ko anjaane hi prabhavit karti rahati hai
 Consciousness develops through interaction with the social environment
 vaataavaran ke prabhaav se manushya naitikta, auchity or vyavahaarakushalata praapt karata he
 This is called development of consciousness
 vikaas kii charam seemaa main chetana nij swatantraaa kii anubhuti karti he
 She can influence and influence social things, but can also separate herself from this effect
 chetana ko is prakaar kii anubhuti ko shuddh chaitanya athwa pramaata, aatma aadi shabdon se sambodhit kiya jaataa he
 It has been discussed by scholars like Charles Yung, Spengel, William Brown etc
 ise deshkal kii seemaa ke baahar mana gaya he
 Video 1266 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 1266 BC or the year before his birth is considered as the basis of Jesus' birth
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
 shaq samvath bharat kaa pracheen samvath he jo isa ke janm ke 78 varsh baad se armbh hota he
 Sak Sanwat is National Calendar of India
 bharat main prachlit kuch anya pracheen samvath is prakaar he- Based on the above difference, according to 1266 BC, the year etc
 can be extracted in Vikrami Samvat, Saptarshi Samvat, Kaliyuga Samvat and ancient Saptarshi etc

2001 kii yah bahut lokapriy film rahi
 Its DVD sales were the highest till 2007
 yah film 19ve sadi main basii angrez raaj ke daur kii ek kehani he
 Bhuvan, a resident of Champaner village, is an enthusiastic and idealistic youngster
 madhya pranto kii angrez chhavnee ke senapati, captain rassal ke saath uski nahi banati thi
 When the British ordered to collect the year's revenue, then the villagers went to the British camp with Bhuvan to beg Raja Puran Singh to forgive the rent
 vahaan raja, british afasaron kaa cricket kaa khel dekh rahe the
 When an officer abused a villager, Bhuvan quarreled with the officers and equaled the game of cricket with gilli-danda
 raja ke samaksh bhuvan ne kathor lagaan ke kilaaf apana virodh darj kiya
 Captain Russell did not like this and challenged Bhuvan to play cricket
 jite to salbhar kaa lagaan maaf, haare to lagaan tiguna!!! gaanvvaale to is chunauti mukarana chaahate the, magar captain rassal ne ye faisalaa sirf bhuvan ke haathon main saunpa
 To increase the challenge further, he also gave the greed to forgive the three-year rent
 bhuvan ne maidan par dwandv kaa nyotaa sweekaar kar liya
 Now as if Champaner wanted to crucify Bhuvan
 sabaki zindagi to ab tabah hone ja rahi thi
 But for Bhuvan, so long as i breath
 kai saalon se sookhaa chal rahaa tha
 After all, where would you have paid even a year's rent? And then even Captain Russell was not going to be challenged
 agavaani karte huye bhuvan ne lakdi kaa balla or gend banaae
 Except for a group of few people, the whole village was laughing at the game of Bhuvan
 cricket seekhney yah dal chori chupe chhavnee par jane laga
 There, Captain Rasel's sister Elizabeth saw him hiding in the bushes
 use apane bhai kaa gaanvvasiyon se vyavhaar pasand nahin aayaa
 She started teaching crickets to the village players on the field near the village
 hindi bhashaantar ke liye ek naukar bhi chhavnee se apane saath le aati
 Gradually, spontaneously, this team of Bhuvan started learning the game of cricket in its own unique way
 haath majboot karne ve lakdi katate
 The field learners followed the hens and caught them
 goli apane haath pawan chakki kii tarah ghuma gendbaazi karne laga
 Now the people of the village also started showing enthusiasm and Akhir became ten players
 ek din khelte vakt gend kachra ke paas giri
 Garbage was the untouchable cleaning servant of the village
 lautaate vakt usne gend is tarah ghumaakar phanki kii bhuvan dang rah gaya
 The village team got the eleventh selection
 magar gaanv vaale ek achhut ko kis tarah apanaate? ve to use choote tak nahin
 Bhuvan criticized the village and this tradition, which lasted for centuries
 bhuvan ke bhav bhare shabdon se gaanv ke nivasi maan gaye
 Finally the day of combat woke up
 saare praant se log khel dekhne aae
 Captain Rasal's senior officer was also present
 khel teen dino kaa nishchit kiya gaya tha
 The villagers first started throwing the ball
 unka shriganesh achhchhaa hua
 Soon a wicket fell from Renaut
 goli kii anokhi gend faikane kii adaa se ghabadaa kar ek or gora khiladi out hua
 But the British players were also no less
 dheer-dhire ve pari sambhalate gayi
 Suddenly the garbage ball kept rolling
 lakh ne to kai kach bhi gawaae
 At the end of the first day, the white group was dominating
 us raat olizabath ne chhavnee main lakh ko captain rasal se milte dekh liya
 Now it was found that Lakha was cheating from the villagers
 olizabath gaanvvasiyon ko cricket kii talim detii thi yah baat captain rasal ko bataa di
 It was also told that he also lost the catch deliberately
 jab gaanvvasiyon ko pataa chalaa to lakh kii khaal oodhedna chahte the
 Lakha escaped from them and took refuge in the village temple
 lakh ne kubul kiya kii bhuvan se jalan ke kaaran usne yah dhokhebaazi kii
 He also wanted Gauri like Bhuvan but Gauri liked Bhuvan
 ek mauka or lakh ko diya gaya
 The next day Lakha made tremendous catches
 kachra bhi apana jaadu phir chalaane laga
 He took three wickets in three balls simultaneously
 goron kii pari kareeb tinsau ran par samaapt hui
 Bhuvan's team started the batting vigorously
 british sena ke bhootpurv sipaahi deva kamanaseebi se out ho gayi
 Then the British players condemned the village batsmen and threw them out and they soon started getting out
 doosraa din khatm hua or aadhe ran banane abhi baaki the
 Meanwhile, half the team was out
 magar bhuwan abhi khel me jivit tha
 On the third day Baid Ishwar Kaka of the village and Ismail supported Bhuvan
 ismail ko to pichle din chot lagi thi
 Both batted very strongly
 dono ran-out ho gayi
 Now the garbage took the bat
 bhuvan ne bahut koshish kii ki zyaada ballebaazi vahi sanbhale
 The trash required six runs on the last ball
 magar vah ek hi ran le paaya
 Are the villagers losers? The umpire made a no-ball gesture
 ab ek or gend kaa samana bhuvan ne jhela
 Bhuvan hit a six and the village prevailed
 or saath hi barsaat bhi shuru hui
 Captain Russell was sent by his superiors to Central Africa
 olizabath landhan lauti
 Weeping wept farewell to the weeping Bhuvan and the people of the village
 film ke ant me ek parshvavaani bataati he ki captain rassal kii badali africa hui or olizabath sari zindagi swayam ko bhuwan kii radha maan kar, kanvaari rahi
 Bhuvan and Gauri get married

 The word Chhanda is used in many meanings
 "chhandas" veda kaa paryaayavachi naam he
 The lyrical system of letters and quantities is called chhanda
 isi arth main padya shabd kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The verse is used in a more broad sense
 bhashaa main shabd or shabdon main varna tathaa swar rahete hai
 They are given the name of Chhanda after arranging them with a certain legislation
 chhandashastra isaliye atyant pusht shaastra mana jaataa he kyonki vah ganit par aadhaarit he
 In fact, it seems that the scripture has been designed so that the advance child can make verses based on its rules
 chandashastra ke granthon ko dekhne se yah bhi gyaat hota he ki jahaan ek ore acharya prastaaradi ke dwaara chando ko viksit karte rahe vahiin duusari ore kavigan apni ore se chhandon main kinchit parirvan karte hue naveen chhandon kii sristi karte rahe jinka chandashastra ke grathon main kalantar main samavesh ho gaya
 No definite consideration can be given as to when the verses were composed
 kinvadanti he ki maharishi valmiki adikavi hai or unka ramayana naamak kavy adikavy he
 Ma nishad pratishtam twam gham: shashwati sama: yatkraunchamithunadekamavadhi:, kammohitam - This anushtupa versa is the first stanza emanating from the mouth of Valmiki, which manifested itself in the form of a shloka suddenly
 yadi is kinvadanti ko maan liya jaae, chand kii rachana pehle hui or chandashastra uske pashchaat aayaa
 In the Valmikya Ramayana, the use of anusthupa verses has been practiced, other subcastes etc
 are also used in abundance
 ek anya kinvadanti yah he ki chandashastra ke aadi aavishkarta bhagavan shesh hai
 Once Garuda caught him
 shesh ne kaha ki hamaare paas ek apratim vidya he jo aap sikh len, taduparant hamen khaaen
 Garuda said that you make excuses and are disconcerting us
 shesh ne uttar diya ki ham asaty bhaashan nahin karte
 Garuda accepted this and the rest began to teach him the verses
 vividh chhandon ke rachananium bataate hue ant main shesh ne "bhujangprayati" chand kaa niyam bataaya or sheeghra hi samudr main pravesh kar gaye
 Garuda said on this that you cheated us, the rest replied that we gave you information before leaving
 chaturbhimkare bhujangprayati arthath chaar ganon se bhujang prayaat chand banataa he or prayukt hota he
 In this way, the emergence of metaphysics
 isse prathit hota he
 That metaphysics appeared as a divine discipline
 is prakaar bhi kaha ja saktaa he ki iske aavishkkarta shesh naamak koi acharya the jinke vishay main is samay kuch vishesh gyaan or soochna nahin he
 After this, it is said that Shesha took the incarnation as Pingalacharya, composed Chhandasutra, which is called Pingalashastra
 yah granth sutarastyli main likhaa gaya he or is samay tak uplabdh he
 Commentaries and explanations have been done on this
 yahi chandashastra kaa sarvapratham granth mana jaataa he
 After this, many texts were composed in Sanskrit literature on this scripture
 chandashastra ke rachiyataaon ko do shreniyon main vibhakt kiya ja saktaa he : ek acharya shrenee, jo chandashastra kaa shastreey nirupan karti he or duusari kavi shrenee, jo chandashastra par pruthak rachanaayen prastut karti he
 Shortly afterward, an author category appeared and which included such writers who interpret the verses of the verses on their own, but cite examples from other composed and popular passages
 hindi main bhi chandashastra par anek granth likhe gaye hai
 The two main topics of thought in the scripture are: chand mukhyat: do prakaar ke hai : Whose Prayong is found in the Vedas
 inamen hrasv, deergh, plut or swarit, in chaar prakaar ke swaron kaa vichaar kiya jaataa he, yatha "anushtup" ityadi
 Vedic verses are considered apaurusheya
 inkaa prayog saahatyantargat kiya jaataa hai, kintu vastut: loukik chand ve chand hai jinka prachaar saamaanya lok athwa janasamudaay main rahata he
 These verses are not based on any fixed rules, but are especially based on rhythm and rhythm, so they are composed by the normal unread people
 loukik chhandon se taatpary hota he un chhandon se jinaki rachana nishchit niyamon ke aadhaar par hoti he or jinka prayog supathit kavi kavyadi rachana main karte hai
 The scripture-related rules of these temporal verses are systematically laid down in the scripture is known as metaphysics
 chhandon kaa vibhaajan varnon or matraaon ke aadhaar par kiya gaya he
 The verses are first considered to be of two types: Varnic and Matric
 inamen vritton kii sankhya nishchit rahati he
 There are also two types of it - negative and non-negative
 ganaatmak vanink chhandon ko vrutt bhi kehete hai
 Their composition is based on the Ganas made of three short and long ganas
 laghu tathaa deergh ke vichaar se yadi varnon k prastaaravyavastha kii jaae aath rup banate hai
 These are called "eight ganas", in which B, N, M, y are considered auspicious and J, R, S, t are considered inauspicious
 vaakya ke aadi main pratham chaar ganon kaa prayog uchit he, antim chaar kaa prayog nishiddh he
 If you want to use only the verses starting with inauspicious Ganas, you should use the word Devatavachi or Mangalavachi or the first word - it removes Ganodosh
 in ganon main paraspar mitra, shatru or udasin bhav mana gaya he
 The combination of two ganas is considered in the beginning of the verses
 varnon ke laghu evam deergh maanane kaa bhi niyam he
 Short vowels or characters with one volume are considered to be short or descent and one volume is considered
 deergh swaron se yukt sanyukt varnon se purv kaa laghu varna bhi visarg yukt or anuswaar varna tathaa chand kaa varna deergh mana jaataa he
 Negative chromatic circles are those in which the idea of ganas is not kept, only the idea of a fixed number of varnas is kept
 In particular mathematical verses only the definite idea of quantities is kept and it is based on a particular rhythm or tempo
 isaliye ye chand laypradhan hote hai
 Varnic verses are kept according to the Varnas
 teen varnon ke samooh ko gana kehete hai
 The names of these ganas are: Yagan, Magan, Tagan, Ragan, Jagan, Bhagana, Nagan and Sagana
 akele laghu ko ‘l’ or guru ko ‘ga’ kehete hai
 The following formula is helpful to know what order of the minor guru in which gana- jis gana ko jaananaa ho uskaa varna is main dekhakar agle do varna or saath jod lete hai or usee kram se gana kii matraayen laga lete hai, jaise: They are called Adilaghu or Adiguru, based on the only quantity in quantities
 jisamen sab guru he, vah ‘magan’ sarvaguru kahalaaya or sabhi laghu hone se ‘nagan’ sarvalaghu kahalaaya
 In Sanskrit, most of the alphabetic verses are taught; Less than mere verses
 sanskrit main is kaa naam 'dohadika' chand he
 There are thirteen-thirteen in its odd stages and eleven-eleven in even stages
 visham charnon ke aadi main
 ऽ
 is prakaar kaa maatra-kram nahin hona chahie or ant main guru or laghu varna hone chahie
 The rhyme of even steps should be found among themselves
 jaise: This couplet has been marked with both odd and even steps in the first line
 isi prakaar duusari pankti main bhi aap donon charnon par ye chihn laga sakate hai
 Therefore, Doha is a semiscriptive meter
 harigitika chand main prayek charan main 28 matraayen hoti hai or ant main laghu or phir guru varna avashya hona chahie
 Yeti is followed by 16 and 12 quantities; like is chand main prayek charan main chhbbees matraayen hoti hai or 14 tathaa 12 matraaon ke baad yeti hoti he
 like: chhandon kaa vibhaajan matraaon or varnon kii charan-bhed-sambandhi vibhinn sankhyaon par aadhaarit he
 In this way the verses are even, odd, half-hearted
 sam chhandon main chand ke chaaron charnon main varnaswarasankhya samaan rahati he
 The first, third and second and fourth alphabet numbers in Ardhasam remain the same
 visham chand ke chaaron charnon main varnon evam swaron kii sankhya asmaan rahati he
 These characters are mutually distinct, and after a certain number of letters and quantities, verses consisting of a majority of letters and vowels are called dandaks
 inaki sankhya bahut adhik he
 The verses can then be divided in other ways as well
 swatantra chand or mishrit chand
 The independent verse is composed by the same rule
 mishrit chand do prakaar ke he : The frequency of the fourth phase of the couplet is added to the first phase of the couplet by joining the couplet and rolla, and the initial few words of the couplet are placed at the end of the roll
 duusare prakaar kaa mishrit chand he "chappay" jisamen chaar charan rola ke dekar do ullala ke die jate hai
 That is why it is called Shaxtadi or Chappay
 inke dekhne se yah gyaat hota he ki chhandon kaa vikaas na keval prastaar ke aadhaar par hi hua he varan kaviyon ke dwaara chand-mishran-vidhi ke aadhaar par bhi hua he
 Similarly, some verses have come in the form of the opposite form of a single verse, as the opposite of couplets is Soratha
 aisa prathit hota he ki kaviyon ne bahudhaa isi ek chand main do ek varna athwa maatra badha ghataakar bhi chand main roopaantar kar nayaa chand banaaya he
 This stanza may fall under the passage
 laghu chhandon ko chhodkar bade chhandon kaa ek charan jab ek baar main puraa nahin padhaa ja saktaa, usamen rachana ke rukne kaa sthaan nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he
 This break is called Yeti
 yeti ke vichaar se chand phir do prakaar ke ho jate hai- The whole idea of elegance is laid out by the musical element in the verses
 praaia: sabhi chand kisi na kisi rup main gey ho jate hai
 Not all verses with raga and ragini can be said in verses
 isi liye "geeti" naam se katipay pad rache jate hai
 Often, in musical terms, the vowel mount and the descent are often shortened to short, long to short and short to short
 kabhi kabhi hindi ke chhandon main deergh e or o jaise swaron ke laghu roopon kaa prayog kiya jaataa he

 ve apane aandolan ko kriyaatmak rup de pate, usase pehle hi giraftaar karke angrejon ne unhen 29 agast, 1931 ko faansee par lataka diya
 Now the leadership of the ongoing movement for independence came into the hands of the girl Gaidinlu
 usne gandhi ji ke aandolan ke bare main sunakar sarkaar ko kisi prakaar kaa kar na dene kii ghoshnaa kii
 He took steps to form a united front against the British by establishing unity among the tribes of Nagas
 uske tejasvi vyaktitv or nirbhayata ko dekhakar janajaatiy log use sarvashaktishaalee devi maanane lage the
 There was dissatisfaction with the execution of the leader Jadonagh, Gaidinlu turned him to the right direction
 solah varsh kii is balika ke saath keval chaar hazaar sashastr naga sipaahi the
 With this, the underground Gaidinlu faced the British army
 vah chhapamar yuddh or shastr sanchaalan main atyant nipun thi
 The British considered him a very dangerous leader
 duusari ore janata kaa har varg use apana uddharak samajhataa tha
 To suppress this movement, the British burnt many villages to ashes but this did not diminish the enthusiasm of the people
 sashastr naagaon ne ek din khuleam 'assam rifles' kii sarkari chaowkee par hamalaa kar diya
 Changing places, raiding the British army, Gaidinlu decided to build a fortress large enough to house four thousand Naga companions

 It is headquartered in Ernakulam, Kerala
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, antarrashtriya simaaon yaa kshetron ke aar-paar puunji, maal or sevaaon kaa aadan-pradaan he
 
 In most countries, it represents a significant fraction of GDP
 jabaki antarrashtriya vyapaar, itihaas ke adhikansh bhaag main maujuud rahaa he iskaa aarthik, saamaajik or raajnneetik mahatv haal kii sadiyon main badhane laga he
 Industrialization, advanced transport, globalization, multinational corporations and outsourcing have all had a wide impact on the international trade system
 vaishvikaran kii nirantarata ke liye antarrashtriya vyapaar main badhotaree mahatvapurn he
 Without international trade, countries will be limited to goods and services produced within their own borders
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, siddhant rup main gharelu vyapaar se bhinn nahin he kyonki ek vyapaar main shaamil pakshon kii abhiprerana or vyavhaar moulik rup se badalata nahin he bhale hi vyapaar seemaa paar kaa ho yaa nahin
 The main difference is that international trade is generally more expensive than domestic trade
 iskaa kaaran he ki ek seemaa aam taur par atirikt shulk lagaati he jaise prashulk, seemaa par vilamb ke kaaran aavadhik laagat or bhashaa, kanoonee pranali yaa samskruti jaise deshiy bhinnataaon se judi laagtein
 Another difference between domestic and international trade is that production factors such as capital and labor are generally more dynamic within countries than outside
 is prakaar antarrashtriya vyapaar zyaadaatar maal or sevaaon ke vyapaar tak simit he or puunji, shram yaa utpaadan ke anya karkon ke vyapaar main keval ek chote paimaane par
 iske alaava maal or sevaaon kaa vyapaar, utpaadan karkon main vyapaar ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main kaary kar saktaa he
 Instead of importing a factor of production, a country can import goods that make intensive use of the factor of production and thus include the related factor
 An example is the import of labor-intensive goods by the United States from China
 Instead of importing Chinese labor, the US is importing goods from China that have been produced using Chinese labor 
 antarrashtriya vyapaar, arthshaastra kii ek shakha bhi he, jo antarrashtriya vitt ke saath milakar antarrashtriya arthshaastra kii vistrut shakha kaa nirmaan karti he
 Several different models have been proposed to forecast the methodology of trade and to analyze the impact of trade policies such as tariffs
 ricardian model tulanaatmak laabh par kendrit he or antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main shaayad sabase mahatvapurn avadharana he
 In a Ricardian model, countries specialize in the production of the things they produce well
 anya modelon ke vipareet, ricardian dhaancha purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, maal kii ek vistrut shrunkhlaa kaa utpaadan karne ke bajaay visheshgy honge
 In addition, the Ricardian model does not directly consider factor funds, such as the relative amount of labor and capital within a country
 The major advantage of the Ricardin model is that it visualizes technology variations between countries
 praudyogiki antar, ricardian or ricardo-srapha model main aasaani se shaamil hota he 
 The Ricardian model makes the following assumptions: ricardian model laghu-avadhi main maapan karata he, isliye praudyogiki antarrashtriya str par bhinn hoti he
 This supports the fact that countries follow their comparative advantage and allow for specialization
 ricardian vyapaar model kaa adhyayan graham, jones, mekenzi or anya dwaara kiya gaya
 All principles excluded trade input goods such as intermediate goods, commodities and capital goods
 mekenji, jones or samuelson ne jor diya ki vyapaar se madhyavarti vastuon ko baahar rakhe jane se kaaphi laabh kho jayega
 ek prasiddh tippanee main mekenji ne kaha ki "ek pal kaa vichaar ek vyakti ko samajha degaa ki sooti kapade kaa utpaadan karne ke liye lankashair asambhavy hoga, yadi kapaas ko england main ugaana pade
 More recently, it expanded the theory to include the business intermediate case as well
 is prakaar "keval shram" dharna siddhant se nikaal di gai
 Thus the new Ricardian theory, sometimes named the ricardo-sraffa model, theoretically includes capital goods such as machines and materials, traded between countries
 vaishvik vyapaar ke samay main, yah dharna heksher-olin model kii apeksha adhik yathartwaadee he, jo yah maanata he ki puunji, desh ke andar sthir he or antarrashtriya str par gatisheel nahin he
 In the early 1900s, two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil Olin, created an international trade theory called the factor ratio theory
 is siddhant ko heksher-olin siddhant bhi kaha jaataa he
 The heckscher-olin theory emphasizes that countries should produce and export goods that require resources that are abundant and must import goods that require short-supply resources
 yah siddhant, tulanaatmak laabh or purna laabh ke siddhanton se bhinn he kyonki ye siddhant ek vishesh vastu ke liye utpaadan prakriya kii utpaadakta par kendrit hai
 In contrast, the heckscher-olin theory states that a country should specialize in production and export using factors that are most abundant and therefore cheap
 Do not produce those goods, as stated by earlier theories, which they produce most efficiently
 heksher-olin model ko buniyadi tulanaatmak laabh ke ricardian model ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main nirmit kiya gaya tha
 Despite its greater complexity, it did not prove to be more accurate in its forecasts
 lekin ek saidhantik drushtikon se dekhne par yah antarrashtriya vyapaar siddhant main nav-shastreey mulya tantra ko shaamil karke ek suruchipurna samaadhaan pradaan karata he
 This theory argues that the pattern of international trade is determined by differences in factor funds
 yah purvanumaan lagaataa he ki desh, un maalon kaa niryaat karenge, jo sthaneey rup se prachur karkon kaa upyog karte hai or un maalon kaa aayaat karenge, jo aise karkon kaa upyog karte hai jo sthaneey rup se atyant alp hai
 Empirical problems with the HO model, known as the Leontief paradox, were encountered in empirical tests by Vasily Leontief, who found that the US was exporting labor-intensive goods despite the abundance of capital
 H-O model nimnlikhit mukhya dharanaen banaata he: The problem with HO theory is that it does not involve the trade of capital goods
 In HO theory, labor and capital are constant substances for each country
 ek aadhunik arthvyavastha main, puunjigat vastuon kaa antarrashtriya str par kaarobaar kiya jaataa he
 Trade in intermediate goods benefits greatly, as emphasized by Samuelson
 kai arthshaastri ricardo siddhant kii tulana main heksher-olin siddhant ko pasand karte hai, kyonki yah kam saral dharanaon ko banaata he
 In 1953, Vecily Leontief published a study where he tested the validity of the heckscher-olin theory
 The study showed that the US was more abundant in capital than other countries, so the US was exporting capital-intensive goods and importing labor-intensive goods
 Leontief found that US exports were less capital-intensive than imports
 leontiff virodhabhas ke ubharne ke baad, kai shodhakartaaon ne heksher-olin siddhant ko bachaane kii koshish kii, yaa to maapan ke nae tareekon dwaara, yaa nai vyakhyaaon ke dwaara
 limar ne bal diya ki leontiff ne H-O siddhant kii sahi vyakhya nahin kii or daawa kiya ki ek sahi vyakhya ke saath virodhabhas ghatit nahin hua
 Brecher and Choudary found that, if Leamer was right, the per capita consumption of American workers should be lower than the world average of workers' consumption
 baad main kai anya pareekshan hue lekin unamem se zyaadaatar asafal rahe
 Many well-known textbook authors, including Krugman and Obstfeld and Bowen, Hollander, and VN, are negative about the validity of the HO model
 
 anubhavjanya anusandhan ke lambey itihaas kaa pareekshan karne ke baad, boven, holender or vien ne nishkarsh diya: "kaarak bahutayat siddhant ke haal ke pareekshan jo sidhe HOV samikarnon kii jaanch karte hai, ve siddhant kii asweekruti kaa bhi sanket dete hai"
 :321 The Heckscher – Olin theory has not been well adapted to analyze south – north trade problems
 HO ke anumaan, N-N vyapaar kii tulana main N-S ke sambandh main kam yathartwaadee hai
 The income difference between North and South is the one thing the Third World cares the most
 kaarak mulya samakaran ne vasuuli kaa adhik sanket nahin dikhaaya he
 The HO model assumes that similar production functions between countries
 yah behad avastavik he
 Differentiation of technology between developed and developing countries is a major concern for poor countries
 is model main, udyogon ke bich shram gatishiltaa sambhav he, jabaki alpavadhi main udyogon ke bich puunji sthir he
 Thus, this model can be interpreted as a 'short-term' version of the Heckscher – Olin model
 vishisht kaarak naam, pradaan kiye jane vaale ke liye yah sandarbhit karata he ki alpavadhi main, bhautik puunji jaise utpaadan ke vishisht kaarak udyogon ke bich aasaani se antarneey nahin hai
 The theory suggests that if there is an increase in the price of the goods, then the owners of the factor of production in the specific context of that goods will have real good advantage
 iske alaava, virdohi utpaadan ke vishisht karkon ke maalikon ke paas virdohi kaarysoochee hone kii sambhaavna hoti jab ve shram ke apravas par niyantran ke liye paksh jutate hai
 In contrast, owners of both capital and labor benefit realistically from the increase in capital funds
 yah model vishesh udyogon ke liye adarsh he
 This model is ideal for understanding income distribution but is naïve to discuss the method of trade
 naveen vyapaar siddhant, vyapaar ke bare main kai tathyon ko samajhane kii koshish karata he, jo upar ullikhit do mukhya modelon ke liye mushkil he

 In the 19th century, especially in the United Kingdom, trust in free trade became paramount
 uske baad se yah dharna pashchimi deshon ke bich prabhavi soch ban gai
 In the years following World War II, controversial multilateral treaties such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization attempted to promote free trade by creating a globally regulated trade framework
 in vyapaar samjhauton ne, anuchit vyapaar ke daavon ke saath jo vikasshil deshon ke liye laabhadaayak nahin hai, aksar virodh or asantosh ko janm diya he
 Free trade is generally the most favored by the most economically strong countries, although they often engage in selective protectionism for industries that are strategically important, such as the US and Europe's imposition of agriculture
 a protective tariff
 The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were staunch advocates of free trade at the time when they were financially influential, today the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Japan being its biggest supporters
 haalanki, kai anya desh tezi se mukt vyapaar ke himachati banate ja rahe hai kyonki ve aarthik rup se khud adhik shaktishaalee ban rahe hai
 As the tariff level is declining, the desire to discuss non-tariff measures is also increasing, including foreign direct investment, recovery and trade facilitation
 Trade facilitation takes into account customs procedures and transaction costs related to carrying out trade

 Often, there is not an option for governments of many countries but they are also known as welcoming international businesses as they need "cash" or dollars
 udhaaharan ke liye, niryaat or aayaat ke bich ke antar ko chaalu khate ke ghate yaa siedi ke rup main janaa jaataa he

 In addition, domestic industry capabilities may not be a particular area nor the expertise to be successful in developing that field
 isliye, epadiai ki kshetra ke vikaas ke liye aavashyak ho jaataa he
 In addition, the opening of the economy is necessary for entry into the World Trade Organization or World Trade Organization, which means that in order to export to other countries, to open in emerging markets and developing economies
 in vajahon se vikasshil deshon main kai sarkarein apane-apane deshon main seoup ke sanchaalan ke liye antarrashtriya kaarobaar main videshi nivesh ko protsaahit karne or anumati dene ke kuch kar rahe hai
 However, a host of factors that do not continue the policies of the same governments include the ideological balance of governments, the compulsions of politics, and the fact that foreign investment may not succeed in kick-starting as a planned economy
 it depends on
 yahaan mahatvapurn pahalu yah he ki ubhartee arthvyavasthaaon ke kai sarkarein aksar kyonki uparokt kaarnon kaa khuli bahon se antarrashtriya kaarobaar kaa swaagat he
 However, through the intervening process, some of them develop cold feet due to policy paralysis, and the factors listed above

 Finally, examples from China, Brazil, South Africa, and Vietnam demonstrate the need for a consensus on the opening of economies and following through on this process
