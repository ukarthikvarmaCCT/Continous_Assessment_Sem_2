 It is difficult to create sections or sections of dictionaries in terms of subjects
 alag alag koshkar apni samaj ke anusaar is prakaar ke vishayvibhag banaaya karte the
 There was neither any fixed order nor could it happen
 isaliye logon ko praaia: sara kosh kanthsth karnaa padataa tha
 For this reason, dictionaries in Western countries started being made alphabetically
 aise kosh ratane nahin padate the or aavashyaktaanusaar jab jiskaa ji chahta tha, tab vah uskaa upyog kar saktaa tha
 Nowadays, in almost all countries and all languages, this sequence is being used in the field of thesaurus: which is the most important in terms of the curious
 isi liye kosh ke jitne prakaar hote hai, un sab main praaia: aksharkram kaa hi prayog kiya jaataa he
 There are many types of thesaurus, but considering the meaning, they can be divided into two parts
 ek to ve jinamein kisi bhashaa ke shabdon ke arth or vivechan usee bhashaa main hote he or duusare ve jinamein ek bhashaa ke shabdon ke arth duusari bhashaa yaa bhashaaon me die jate hai
 There can be many types of thesaurus with the idea of subject, such as Mathematics dictionary, Legal dictionary, Medical dictionary etc
 aise koshon kii ginati praaia: shabdaawaliyon main hoti he, jaise krishi shabdaawalee, darshanik shabdaawalee, bhugolic shabdaawalee aadi
 Apart from these, some specific poets, dialects etc
 also have different lexicons, such as Tulsi Kosh, Sur Kosh, Awadhi Kosh, Brajbhasha Kosh, etc
 kisi vishisht vishay ke mahatvapurn granth main aae hue mukhya pratikon, vishyon yaa shabdon ke jo kosh yaa talikaay hoti he, unhen kramaat pratikanukramanika, vishayanukramanika yaa shabdanukramanika kehete hai
 Lexicography is an art
 is kala kaa gyaan vartmaan yug kii param unnat bhashaaon ke shabdkoshon kaa sookshm drushti se adhyayan karne par praapt ho saktaa he
 Editing of good and authentic thesaurus cannot be done only on the strength of scholarship, as long as the art of lexicography is also fully understood and the knowledge of this art can only come from the lifelong study of the lexicon
 sabhi prakaar ke kosh kisi vishesh uddeshy tathaa kisi vishesh kshetra kii aavashyaktaa kii purti ke liye hi banaae jate hai
 Therefore, this purpose or need is mainly taken care of in the lexicon
 duusare, is baat kaa bhi baraabar dhyaan rakhana padataa he ki uskaa sara kalevar sabhi drushtiyon se santulit rahe; aisa na ho ki koi ang to aavashyaktaa yaa auchity se adhik bad jaae or koi uski tulana main kshinkaay yaa hin jaan pade
 The words should also be discussed and the order of the organs of that thought should always remain the same
 shabdon kii bhi jatiyaan yaa varg hote hai, at: ek jati yaa varg ke sab shabdon kaa sara vivechan ek sa hona chahie
 If examples of authentic texts or writers are taken, then they should be taken as much fraction as possible to clarify the intention and resolve the curious
 achche koshon main sabhi prakaar ke kshetron or vishyon ke paribhaashik shabd bhi rahete hai
 Therefore, the editor should have general knowledge or understanding of more and more subjects
 aavashyaktaa hone par kisi anjaane yaa nae vishay ke achche or pramanik granth se yaa uske achche gyaata se bhi sahaayta lenaa aavyashk hota he
 In the task of lexicography, the vision should be very wide and the instinct should be honeycomb
 drushti itani paini or sookshm honi chahie jo sahaj main nir ksheer kaa vivek kar saken or puraani trutiyon, dosha, bhuulon aadi ko dhundkar sahaj main unka sanshodhan tathaa sudhaar kar sake
 In the lexicon, there should also be no partiality or malicious name
 uskaa ekmaatr uddeshy hona chahie bhashaa tathaa sahitya kii seva
 In the lexicon, the primacy is only of meanings and thoughts, so there should not be any spread or overlap in them
 sabhi baaten nappi tuli, maryaadit or yathasadhay sankshipt honi chahie
 The maximum and concrete information in the dictionary should be presented in minimum words
 phaltu yaa bharti kii baton ke liye kosh main sthaan nahin hota
 Some forms of words are normative and many forms are spatial or provincial
 jin sthanik yaa prantiy shabdon ke maanak rup praapt hon, unka sara vivechan unheen maanak shabdon ke antargat rahanaa chahie or unke sthanik yaa prantiy roopon ke aage unke maanak roopon kaa abhidesh maatr hona chahie
 This has the great advantage that other linguists readily learn the standard form of the words and help the standard form of the language to be constant — that the form of the language is not deteriorated by the unfamiliar
 yahi baat aise sanskrit shabdon ke sambandh main bhi honi chahie jiske bahut se paryaay hon
 Like lotus, river, mountain, sea etc
 shabdon ke aage unke paryaay dete samay bhi is baat kaa dhyaan rahanaa chahie ki paryaay vahi die jaae jo mul shabd kaa thik aashay yaa maap bataanevaale hon
 It is advisable to abandon those environments in such contexts, due to which confusion may arise
 koshkaron ke saamne idhar haal main webster kii new world dictionari ne ek nayaa adarsh rakhaa he jo bahut hi upyogi tathaa upadey hone ke kaaran shabdkoshon ke liye vishesh anukaraniya he
 It also shows the subtle differences of similar resemblances to them under several words, such as - subtle differences of dread, frit, alarms, disme, terrer and panic are also mentioned under the fear
 aisa yah soch kaa kiya gaya he ki koshkar kaa kaam shabdon ke arth batala dene se hi samaapt nahin ho jaataa, varan isse bhi aage badhkar uskaa kaam logon ko shabdon ke thik prayog batalaana hota he
 We will find hundreds of thousands of such words, whose subtle differences can be revealed, and thus the curious can be made to think about the words in a new way
 haal ke achche or bade angareji koshon main ek or nai tathaa upyogi paripati chali he jo bhartiya bhashaaon ke koshon ke liye vishesh rup se upyogi ho sakati he
 In all languages, there are many compound words which are formed by prefixing
 kanishtha se akanishtha, karaniya se akaraniya, apekshit se anpekshit, aavashyak se anaavashyak, mantri se upamantri, samiti se upasmiti, paalan se paripaalan, bhraman se paribhraman, karm se pratikarm, vidhaan se pratividhan aadi
 The number of such words formed by the sum of prefixes is very large
 aise shabdon do virgon main bante hote hai athwa baante ja sakate hai
 For one, the words whose words are not combined with any new or specific meaning in the former verse and the answer word, which is why they live under ordinary words
 aise shabdon or unke arthon se kosh kaa kalevar bahut bad jaataa he
 To avoid this kind of meaningless expansion, this new method has been adopted in the new dictionaries of Webster that they are not considered as independent words and hence their meanings have not been taken
 prishth ke ant main ek rekha ke neeche aise shabdon kii suchi maatr de di gai he, yatha-an-dizyrd, an-disterbd, an-free, an-hart, an-invited aadi
 Yes, unlike these, there are certain words of other class in which some new meanings are derived from the addition of prefixes
 jaise visheshan rup main akach kaa rup bina balonvala to he hi, par sangya rup main vah ketu grah kaa bhi ek naam he
 Anagar means not only a householder, but in noun form he is also a signifier of a monk
 isaliye aise shabd lenaa aavashyak hota he
 The words whose meanings are automatically destroyed by the sum of predecessor and post-apocalyptic, it is considered futile to take meaning in the dictionary
 at: prishthant main aise shabdon kii suchi maatr de dena yathesht hoga
 Yes, the compound words in which a new and special meaning is derived from the sum of the two terms, it is necessary to take them in the same place as the meaning
 hamaare yahan ke puraane sanskrit koshon kii paddati yah rahi he ki ati, prati sah aadi ke yoga se bananevaale shabd apane purv padwale shabd ke antargat ek hi sheershak main ek saath de die jate he
 Some dictionaries of Hindi have also followed this practice
 yadhyapi sanskrit vyakaran kii drushti se yah paddati yuktisangat hoti he, phir bhi sanskrit koshon tak main inkaa puraa puraa paalan hota hua nahin dikhaai detaa
 There is some saving of space in this, but it becomes very difficult for exceptional readers to find the words
 kabhi kabhi to aise logon ke liye bhi is paddati se shabd dhoondhna kathin hota he jo iske niyamon or siddhanton se bahut kuch parichit hote hai
 In every language, there are some words which are also invariant, adverbs, adjectives, suffix nouns etc
 with the idea of different meanings and are also derived from different roots, ie Hindi is also a noun, adjective and suffix
 Too
 apane sangya rup main bhi vah apane kai arthon main kuch alag alag mulon se vyutpann he
 Such words are considered to be separate and independent words in modern and superior English lexicons and are treated with different titles, viz
 English also has a vise adjective, noun and suffix also and in three forms its titles are kept separately

 GSM ek celular network he, jiskaa matlab he mobile phone apane nazadiiki cell ko khojate hue isse judate he
 Cells in GSM network have five different sizes - macro, micro, pico, femto and umbrella cells
 The scope of each cell varies according to the implementation environment
 sthool cell aise cell maane ja sakate hai, jahaan base stesan antina ek khambhe athwa aisi imaarat par sthapit kiya jaataa he, jisaki oonchaai ausat chhaton se oonchi ho
sookshm cell ve hai jinke antina kii oonchai, ausat chat kii oonchai se kam hoti he; aam taur par inkaa upyog shahari kshetron main kiya jaataa he
 Pico cells are small cells with an expansion diameter of only a few dozen meters; They are mainly used inside the building
 femato cell ve cell hai jinaki pariklpana, awasaiya yaa chote vyavsaayik parivesh main upyog or ek broadband internet conection ke madhyam se seva-pradaata ke network se judane ke liye kii gai he
 Umbrella cells are used to cover the shadow areas of small cells and to fill the gap between those cells
 cell kaa kshaitij arddh vyas antina kii oonchai, antina labdhi or sancharan parivesh ke aadhaar par saikadon meter se lekar kai kilometre tak alag-alag hota he
 Practically the highest distance supported by the GSM specification is 35 kilometers
 There are several implementations of the concept of a wide cell, where the cell's half-diameter antenna system can double or even more, depending on the type of terrain and the advance time

 PA is a common phenomenon inspired by nearby GSM handsets to extract the sound of det, det-det, det det-det, from wireless microphones, home music systems, television, computers, wireless phones, and personal music devices
 jab ye audio upkaran GSM handset ke nikat kshetra main rahete hai, to radio sanket itane majboot hote hai ki thos pravarddhak shravy shrinkhalaa main ek sansuchak kaa kaary karte he
 The sound of the click signifies a power explosion, which is the conductor of the TDMA signal
 ye sanket car ke sterio yaa portable audio player jaise anya electronic upkarnon se hastkshep ke liye jane jate hai
 It also depends on the design of the handset and its US body conforming to the rules and regulations on interference with electronic devices in Part 15 by stringent rules and regulations made by the FCC
 GSM network kai vibhinn fricvency vistaar simaaon main kaary karata he 
 adhikansh 2G GSM network 900 mhz yaa 1800 mhz band par kaary karte hai
 Some US countries use 850 mhz and 1900 mhz, as the 900 and 1800 mhz frequency bands were already allocated
 europe main zyaadaatar 3G GSM network 2100 mhz fricvency band main kaary karte hai
 Rare 400 and 450 mhz frequency bands are specified in some countries, where these frequencies were used for first generation systems
 GSM-900, mobile stesan se base stesan jaankaree bhejne ke liye 890–915 mhz kaa upyog karata he or anya disha ke liye 935–960 mhz kaa upyog karata he, jo 200 khz ke antaraal par 125 RF channel uplabdh karaata he
 a duplex interval of 45 mhz is used
 kuch deshon main GSM-900 band ko adhik fricvency kshetra ko aavruth karne ke liye vistrut kiya gaya he
 It uses 'wide GSM', E-GSM, 880–915 mhz and 925–960 mhz, adding 50 channels to the original GSM-900 band
 samay vibhaajan bahusanketan kaa prayog prati radio fricvency channel, aath purna-dar yaa solah arddh-dar vaak channel ko anumat karne ke liye hota he
 The TDMA frame consists of eight radio timelines
 arddh dar vaale channel ek hi samyavadhi main vaikalpik frem kaa upyog karte hai
 The channel data rate for all 8 channels is 270
833 kbit / s and the frame duration is 4,615 ms
 is handset kii prasaaran shakti GSM850 / 900 main adhiktam 2 wat or GSM1800 / 1900 main 1 wat he
 GSM has used a variety of sound codecs to compress sound between 5
6 and 13 kbit / s
 multah do kodak, yatha arddh dar or purna dar kaa prayog hua he, jinka namakaran unhen abantit data channel prakaar ke aadhaar par hua he
 They use a system that is based on linear pre-predictive coding
 bitret ke prati prabhavi hone ke alaava in kodekon ne dhwani ke adhik mahatvapurn hisson ko pahchaanana kaafii aasaan kar diya he, jisase vaayu antarafalak parat ke liye in sanketon ko rakshit karnaa or praathamikta dena aasaan ho gaya he
 GSM was developed in 1997 to an enhanced full rate codec, a 12
2 kbit / s codec, using a full rate channel
 ant main, UMTS ke vikaas ke saath EFR ek asthir-dar kodak ke rup main punarsanshodhit kiya gaya, jise amr-narrowband kehete hai or jo purna dar channelon par prayog karne par ucch gunvattta vaala va hastkshep ke prati majboot he or saath hi, jab yah achche radio dashaon main arddh-dar channel par prayukt hota he, to yah kam majboot magar apekshaakrit ucch gunvattta vaala hota he
 The network behind GSM, which is visible to the customer, is huge and complex, to provide all the services required
 It is divided into various sections and is explained in separate articles
 GSM kii pramukh visheshtaon main se ek he sabskribar idantity modul, jise aam taur par SIM card ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The SIM is a detachable smart card that contains the user's subscription information and phone book
 yah upyogkarta ke handset badalane ke baad bhi uski jaankaree sanjone detaa he
 Alternatively, the user can do this only by changing the SIM, without changing their handset to change the operator
 kuch oparator ek phone main ek hi SIM athwa sirf unheen ke dwaara die gaye SIM kii anumati dekar is kriya ko baadhit kar dete hai; is abhyaas ko SIM loking kehete hai or kuch deshon main yah gair-kanoonee he
 Many operators in Australia, North America and Europe lock the mobiles they sell
 aisa isliye kiya jaataa he ki mobile phone kii qimaton par aam taur par sadsyta ke samay se riyaayat di jaati he or oparator apane pratiyogiyon ke mobile par kisi prakaar kii riyaayat ko taalna chaahate hai
 a customer can contact the provider to remove this barrier, usually by paying some fee, or he can open the block through private services, or by using all the software and web-sites available on the Internet
 Can open the block of your handset
 haalanki adhikansh web-site block hataane ke evaj main kuch shulk maangate hai, magar kuch log nickshulk aisa karte hai
 This locking applies to the handset, known by its international mobile device identification number, and not to the account bangladesh, belgium, costa rika, indonesia, malaysia, honkong or pakistan jaise kuch deshon main sabhi phone bina lock kiye hi bikate hai
 However, in Belgium, it is illegal for operators to provide any subsidy on phone prices
 yah sthiti finland main bhi 1 april, 2006 tak thi, jiske baad sabsidi vaale handset or khate bechnaa kanoonee ho gaya, yadhyapi operataron ko kuch nishchit samay ke baad phone ko bina kisi shulk ke khol dena padataa he
 GSM was designed with a moderate level of security
 is pranali kaa abhikalpan, upyogkarta kii pahchaan ek purv-saajha kunjee or chunauti-pratikriya ke prayog se sunishchit karne ke liye hua tha

 These are the following: - vipanan ek satat prakriya he jiske antargat marketing mix kii yojana banaai jaati he evam karyanvayan kiya jaataa he
 This process is done to exchange products, services or ideas between individuals and organizations
 vipanan ko ek rachanaatmak udyog ke rup main dekha jaataa he, jisamen shaamil hai vigyaapan, vitaran or bikri iskaa sambandh graahakon kii bhavi aavashyaktaaon or aakankshaon kaa purv vichaar karne se bhi he, jo praayah bazaar shodh ke madhyam se pataa lagaai jaati hai
 Essentially, marketing is the process of creating or directing an organization so that people can successfully sell the product or service that they not only need but are also willing to buy
 isliye acha vipanan is kaabil hona chahie ki vah upabhoktaaon hetu ek "prastaav" yaa laabhon kaa set bana sake, taaki utpaadon yaa sevaaon ke madhyam se graahak ko uske paise kaa mulya adaa kiya ja sake
 Its specialist areas include: parichay a market-focused or consumer-focused organization first decides what its potential customer wants and then creates a product or service
 jab graahak kisi utpaada yaa seva ko zarurat hone par istemaal karata he yaa use koi kathith laabh hasil hota he, to vipanan siddhant or vyavhaar nyyochit mana jaataa he
 There are two major components of marketing - engaging new customers and expanding existing customers and building relationships with them
 Once the seller makes the incoming buyer their customer, Aadhaar management starts
 aadhaar prabandhan ke tahat jo prakriya armbh hoti he usamen vikreta apane graahak ke saath rishte viksit karata he, sambandhon ko poshan detaa he, die ja rahe phaaydon main izafa karata he or apane utpaada / seva ko nirantar behatar banaata he taaki uskaa vyapaar pratispardhiyon se surakshit rahe
 The success of the marketing plan should reflect the mix of 4 Ps to the demands and needs of consumers or the target market
 Convincing a market segment to buy what they do not need is a very expensive job and rarely successful
 vipanak, aupchaarik or anaupchaarik donon tarah ke vipanan anusandhan se praapt jaankaree par nirbhar karte hai or yah tay karte hai kii graahak kya chahta he or uske liye kitna bhugtan karne kaa icchhuk he
 Marketers hope that this process will give them a sustained competitive advantage
 Marketing management is a practical application for this process
 prastaav bhi 4 Ps siddhant kaa ek mahatvapurn ang he
 According to the American Marketing Association, "marketing is a set of organizational functions and processes by which customers are created, communicated with, and provided with utility and relationships with the consumer to benefit the organization and its stakeholders
" 
 vipanan ke tareekon kii soochna kai saamaajik vigyaanon main di gayi he khaskar manovigyaan, samajashaastra or arthshaastra main
 maanav shaastra kaa prabhaav bhi chota lekin badhata hua he
 Market research strengthens these activities
 vigyaapan ke madhyam se vipanan kai rachanaatmak kalaon se bhi judata he
 Marketing is a broad and largely interconnected subject from many publications
 yah samay va samskruti ke anusaar khud ko or apni shabdaawalee ko nae tareeke se dubaara gadhane ke liye kukhyat he
 "marketing" is an informative business function that informs and educates the target market about the competitive advantage and price of the company and its products
 mulya vah keemat he jo graahak kisi utpaada kaa maalik banane yaa usko istemaal karne ke liye chukaata he
 "competitive advantage" refers to the fact that both the company or its products are doing something better than their competitors to benefit the consumer
 vipanan kaa centre company tathaa utpaada sambandhi suchanaaen nishchit graahakon tak pahunchane par rahata he
 Many decisions are made in marketing work, which information to give, how much information to give, whom to give, how to give and where to give
 ek baar faisle kar liye jaaen to aise kai tareeke or prakriyaayein hai jinhen chuninda ranneetiyon ke samarthan main lagu kiya ja saktaa he
 what is marketing? Chris Newton says marketing is often misunderstood as advertising or sales
 main vipanan ko un sabhi ranneetiyon evam nirnyon ke rup main paribhaashit kiya gaya he jo nimnlikhit baarah kshetro main tay kiye jate hai: The aim of marketing is to create and maintain priority in the target markets for the company and its products
 The intention of any business is to build mutually beneficial and stable relationships with its customers
 Although all areas of business are responsible for achieving this goal, marketing has the highest responsibility
 isaki paribhaasha ko bade daayre main dekha jaae to vipanan kaary teen vishyon ke samanvay se hota he: "utpaada vipanan ", "korporate vipanan " or, "vipanan sanchaar " 
 Strategic Marketing: An attempt to determine how an organization competes with its competitors in the market
 In particular, it aims to take a profitable edge relative to its competitors
 parichaalan sambandhi vipanan: graahakon ko aakarshith karnaa va unhen banaaye rakhana he or unke liye adhik se adhik upyogi hona he
 Simultaneously, to satisfy the customer by prompt services and to meet his expectations
 parichaalan sambandhi vipanan main shaamil hai porter ke paanch balon kaa nirdhaaran In the early 1960s, Professor Neil Borden identified the company's actions at Harvard Business School that could influence a customer's decision to purchase products or services
 borden ne yah sujhaayaa ki company dwaara uthaaye jane vaale ve sabhi kadam "vipanan mishran" hai
 Professor E
 Jerome mccarthy, also from Harvard Business School, suggested in the early 1960s that the marketing mix consisted of 4 elements: product, price, place, and promotion
 aam chalan main "vipanan" utpaada kaa prachaar he, visheshkar vigyaapan or branding kintu, vyavsaayik upyog main iskaa arth vishad he jiskaa matlab he kii vipanan graahak-kendrit he
 Products are developed to meet the needs of a group of customers or in some cases certain customers
 i
jerome maikaarthi ne vipanan ko chaar saamaanya gatividhiyon ke samoohon main baanta
 unki tipology ko duniya bhar main itani manyata hasil hui kii unke "chaar P" bhashaa kaa hissaa ban gaye hai
 These four Ps are: ye chaar tatv vipanan mishran, ke taur par jane jate hanjinaka upyog ek vikreta vipanan yojana banane ke liye karata he
 The four p model is most useful in marketing low-cost consumer products
 audyogic utpaadon, sevaaon, ucch mulya ke upabhokta utpaadon ke maamle main is model main samaayojan karnaa padataa he
 Service marketing should be for unmatched services
 Industrial or B2B marketing should be for long-term contracts that are specialized in supply chain matters
 In relationship marketing, marketing is seen in the context of long-term relationships rather than personal behavior
 iske viruddh morgan ne rayeeding da vevs of change, main sujhaayaa ki 4 Ps drushtikon kii ek sabase badi khami yah he kii "yah anjaane main hi bheetar kii ore jor detaa he, jabaki vipanan kaa saar baahar ko ore hona chahie"
 phir bhi 4 Ps vipanan kaary kii pramukh shreniyon hetu ek yaad rahane evam kaam karne yogya maargdarshika va dhaanche ke taur par madadgaar hai jiske tahat inhen istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 In addition to the already existing four Ps, three additional titles have been added to the marketing of services called the Extended Marketing Mix
 ye hai: a brand is a name, word, design, symbol, or any other feature that distinguishes a product or service from a competitor's offer
 ek brands kisi sanghathan, utpaada yaa seva ke prati upabhokta ke anubhav kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 a brand is also defined as an identifiable entity that promises a specific value
 sah - branding main vipanan gatividhiyaan shaamil hoti hai jisamen do yaa adhik utpaada hote hai
 Pricing refers to the money that is given in exchange for a product
 yah mulya vastu kii upyogita se nirdhaarit hota he kii graahak uske badale main kitne paise or / yaa balidaan dene ko taiyaar he
 Marketing communication creates marketing messages for different categories according to strategy and transmits them to the target
 ajanabiyon ko graahak main parivartit karne ke pruthak charan hote hai jo istemaal kiye jane vaale sanchaar madhyam ko niyantrit karte hai
 An oral presentation by a salesman who approaches an individual or group of potential customers: utpaada kii kharid ko badhaava dene hetu alpakaalik incentive An example of this is a coupon or a sale
 People are encouraged to buy, but this does not build customer confidence nor encourage them to buy again in the future
 vikray vruddhi kii ek badi khami yah he ki pratidwandiyon dwaara ise aasaani se copy kiya ja saktaa he
 Using it, your product cannot always be distinguished from others
 aajkal kai companiyaan apane graahakon par dhyaan kendrit karti hai
 This means that the activities and products of companies are according to the demand of the customers
 aam taur par yah teen tareekon se kiya jaataa he: graahak chaalit drushtikon, bazaar main parivartan ko pahchaanane ki samaj or utpaada ko abhinav banane kaa drushtikon
 Under a consumer driven approach, consumer demands determine strategic marketing decisions
 koi bhi ranneeti tab tak nahin apanaai jaati jab tak kii vah upabhokta anusandhan pareekshan main safal na ho jaae
 ek utpaada kaa har pahalu, jisamen utpaada kii prakruti bhi shaamil he, vah bhavi upabhokta kii zaruuraton se sanchalit hota he
 The starting point is always the consumer
 iske peeche taarkik pahalu yah he kii anusandhan evam vikaas kosh aise utpaada ko taiyaar karne main nahin kharch karnaa chahie jise log khareednaa na chahen
 itihaas gavaah he kii kai utpaada praudyogiki kii anokhi misaal hone ke baavjood bazaar main nahin chale
 The formal approach to this customer-centric marketing is known as SIVA
 In this system, the four Ps have been given new names and new words to focus on the customer
 SIVA model maang / graahak kendrit sanskaran pradaan karata he, jo vipanan prabandhan ke mashhoor 4ps aapurti vaale model kaa vikalp he
 The SIVA model has four elements: is model kaa prastaav checkiton dev or don shultaj ne marketing management jarnal of da american marketing association main diya tha or unhone market leader - da jarnal of da marketing socity in da UK main prastut kiya tha
 This model focuses primarily on the customer navtpaada drushtikon main, company utpaada navachaar kaa anusaran karti he, phir us utpaada hetu bazaar viksit karti he
 Product innovation drives the process and marketing research is done to determine if a profitable market segment exists for that new product
 tark yah he kii shaayad graahakon ko nahin maaloom kii bhavishya main unke paas kya vikalp maujuud honge to hamen yah ummid nahin kerani chahie kii ve hamako bataaen kii ve bhavishya main kya kharidenge
 tathaapi, vipanak aakraamak tareeke se utpaada navachaar ko apana sakate hai or uskaa laabh uthaa sakate hai
 While following the product innovation approach, marketers should decide that they have different and diverse product innovation approaches
 It is claimed that if Thomas Edison relied on marketing research, he would have made larger size wax lights instead of inventing electric bulbs
 Many companies, such as research and development focused companies, successfully focus on product innovation that constantly changes the way VDO games are played)
 Many purity devotees doubt whether this is really a kind of marketing orientation, as the status of consumer research comes later

 1989 main, GSM kii jimmedaari europea doorsanchaar maanak santhaan ko saunpi gai or GSM vinirdeshon kii pratham pravastha kaa prakaashan 1990 main kiya gaya
 In 1991, the first GSM network was launched by Radiolinja in Finland, including maintenance of a joint technical infrastructure with Ericsson
 GSM ek celular network he, jiskaa matlab he mobile phone apane nazadiiki cell ko khojate hue isse judate he
 Cells in GSM network have five different sizes - macro, micro, pico, femto and umbrella cells
 The scope of each cell varies according to the implementation environment
 sthool cell aise cell maane ja sakate hai, jahaan base stesan antina ek khambhe athwa aisi imaarat par sthapit kiya jaataa he, jisaki oonchaai ausat chhaton se oonchi ho
sookshm cell ve hai jinke antina kii oonchai, ausat chat kii oonchai se kam hoti he; aam taur par inkaa upyog shahari kshetron main kiya jaataa he
 Pico cells are small cells with an expansion diameter of only a few dozen meters; They are mainly used inside the building
 femato cell ve cell hai jinaki pariklpana, awasaiya yaa chote vyavsaayik parivesh main upyog or ek broadband internet conection ke madhyam se seva-pradaata ke network se judane ke liye kii gai he
 Umbrella cells are used to cover the shadow areas of small cells and to fill the gap between those cells
 cell kaa kshaitij arddh vyas antina kii oonchai, antina labdhi or sancharan parivesh ke aadhaar par saikadon meter se lekar kai kilometre tak alag-alag hota he
 Practically the highest distance supported by the GSM specification is 35 kilometers
 There are several implementations of the concept of a wide cell, where the cell's half-diameter antenna system can double or even more, depending on the type of terrain and the advance time
 
 bhawan ke andar vyapti bhi GSM dwaara samarthit he or ek antardwar picocel base stesan ke prayog se athwa urja bhanjak dwaara aapurit aantarik antina sahit antardwar punaravartak ke zarie ise hasil kiya ja saktaa he, taaki bahari antina se radio sanket bhawan ke andar alag se sanvitarit antina pranali tak pahunchay ja saken

 The modulation used in GSM is a Gaussian minimum-transfer combination, a type of continuous-phase frequency transfer combination
 GMSK main vaahak par adhimishrit kiye jane vaale sanket ko fricvency adhimishrak par aapurti se pehle gausian lo-paas filter se madhur banaaya jaataa he, jo padosi vahikaaon ke hastkshep kii ashanka ko kaafii kam karte hai
 Some audio devices are sensitive to radio frequency interference, which can be reduced considerably by using additional shielding or by-pass capacitors in addition to these audio devices
 tathaapi, aisa karne main hone vaali baari laagat, kisi bhi diziner ke liye iske auchity ko siddh karnaa mushkil kar detii he
 PA is a common phenomenon inspired by nearby GSM handsets to extract the sound of det, det-det, det det-det, from wireless microphones, home music systems, television, computers, wireless phones, and personal music devices
 jab ye audio upkaran GSM handset ke nikat kshetra main rahete hai, to radio sanket itane majboot hote hai ki thos pravarddhak shravy shrinkhalaa main ek sansuchak kaa kaary karte he
 The sound of the click signifies a power explosion, which is the conductor of the TDMA signal
 ye sanket car ke sterio yaa portable audio player jaise anya electronic upkarnon se hastkshep ke liye jane jate hai
 It also depends on the design of the handset and its US body conforming to the rules and regulations on interference with electronic devices in Part 15 by stringent rules and regulations made by the FCC
 GSM network kai vibhinn fricvency vistaar simaaon main kaary karata he 
 adhikansh 2G GSM network 900 mhz yaa 1800 mhz band par kaary karte hai
 Some US countries use 850 mhz and 1900 mhz, as the 900 and 1800 mhz frequency bands were already allocated
 europe main zyaadaatar 3G GSM network 2100 mhz fricvency band main kaary karte hai
 Rare 400 and 450 mhz frequency bands are specified in some countries, where these frequencies were used for first generation systems
 GSM-900, mobile stesan se base stesan jaankaree bhejne ke liye 890–915 mhz kaa upyog karata he or anya disha ke liye 935–960 mhz kaa upyog karata he, jo 200 khz ke antaraal par 125 RF channel uplabdh karaata he
 a duplex interval of 45 mhz is used
 kuch deshon main GSM-900 band ko adhik fricvency kshetra ko aavruth karne ke liye vistrut kiya gaya he
 It uses 'wide GSM', E-GSM, 880–915 mhz and 925–960 mhz, adding 50 channels to the original GSM-900 band
 samay vibhaajan bahusanketan kaa prayog prati radio fricvency channel, aath purna-dar yaa solah arddh-dar vaak channel ko anumat karne ke liye hota he
 The TDMA frame consists of eight radio timelines

 The channel data rate for all 8 channels is 270
833 kbit / s and the frame duration is 4,615 ms
 is handset kii prasaaran shakti GSM850 / 900 main adhiktam 2 wat or GSM1800 / 1900 main 1 wat he
 GSM has used a variety of sound codecs to compress sound between 5
6 and 13 kbit / s
 multah do kodak, yatha arddh dar or purna dar kaa prayog hua he, jinka namakaran unhen abantit data channel prakaar ke aadhaar par hua he
 They use a system that is based on linear pre-predictive coding

 GSM was developed in 1997 to an enhanced full rate codec, a 12
2 kbit / s codec, using a full rate channel
 ant main, UMTS ke vikaas ke saath EFR ek asthir-dar kodak ke rup main punarsanshodhit kiya gaya, jise amr-narrowband kehete hai or jo purna dar channelon par prayog karne par ucch gunvattta vaala va hastkshep ke prati majboot he or saath hi, jab yah achche radio dashaon main arddh-dar channel par prayukt hota he, to yah kam majboot magar apekshaakrit ucch gunvattta vaala hota he
 The network behind GSM, which is visible to the customer, is huge and complex, to provide all the services required
 It is divided into various sections and is explained in separate articles
 GSM kii pramukh visheshtaon main se ek he sabskribar idantity modul, jise aam taur par SIM card ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The SIM is a detachable smart card that contains the user's subscription information and phone book
 yah upyogkarta ke handset badalane ke baad bhi uski jaankaree sanjone detaa he
 Alternatively, the user can do this only by changing the SIM, without changing their handset to change the operator
 kuch oparator ek phone main ek hi SIM athwa sirf unheen ke dwaara die gaye SIM kii anumati dekar is kriya ko baadhit kar dete hai; is abhyaas ko SIM loking kehete hai or kuch deshon main yah gair-kanoonee he
 Many operators in Australia, North America and Europe lock the mobiles they sell
 aisa isliye kiya jaataa he ki mobile phone kii qimaton par aam taur par sadsyta ke samay se riyaayat di jaati he or oparator apane pratiyogiyon ke mobile par kisi prakaar kii riyaayat ko taalna chaahate hai
 a customer can contact the provider to remove this barrier, usually by paying some fee, or he can open the block through private services, or by using all the software and web-sites available on the Internet
 Can open the block of your handset
 haalanki adhikansh web-site block hataane ke evaj main kuch shulk maangate hai, magar kuch log nickshulk aisa karte hai
 This locking applies to the handset, known by its international mobile device identification number, and not to the account bangladesh, belgium, costa rika, indonesia, malaysia, honkong or pakistan jaise kuch deshon main sabhi phone bina lock kiye hi bikate hai
 However, in Belgium, it is illegal for operators to provide any subsidy on phone prices
 yah sthiti finland main bhi 1 april, 2006 tak thi, jiske baad sabsidi vaale handset or khate bechnaa kanoonee ho gaya, yadhyapi operataron ko kuch nishchit samay ke baad phone ko bina kisi shulk ke khol dena padataa he
 GSM was designed with a moderate level of security
 is pranali kaa abhikalpan, upyogkarta kii pahchaan ek purv-saajha kunjee or chunauti-pratikriya ke prayog se sunishchit karne ke liye hua tha
 The communication between the user and the base station can be encrypted
 UMTS kaa vikaas ek vaikalpik USIM pravartit karata he, jo ki zyaada suraksha dene ke liye ek lambii pahchaan kunjee kaa prayog karti he, saath hi saath upyogkarta or network ko paraspar pramanit karti he - jabaki GSM keval upyogkarta ko network ke saamne pramanit karata he 
suraksha model is vajah se gopneeyata or pramanikaran to prastaavit karata he, magar simit praadhikaran kshamtaayen or bina asveekaran ke
 suraksha ke liye GSM kai kutalekhi kalanvidhi kaa upyog karata he
 A5 / 1 and A5 / 2 stream ciphers are used to ensure privacy of voice over the air
 A5 / 1 kaa vikaas pehle hua tha or ye ek majboot bijlekh he jiskaa prayog europe or america main hota he; A5 / 2 thodaa kamazor he or iskaa prayog anya deshon main hota he
 Both cypher have been found to have serious weaknesses: A5 / 2 can be broken in real-time by a cipher-only attack, and in February 2008, Pico, Computing, Inc
 revealed the fpga's advantageous potential and plan, by which A5 / 1 can be broken by a rainbow table attack
 yah pranali kai kalanvidhi ko samarthan detii he, jisase operators us bijlekh ko kisi majboot sanskaran se badal sakate hai
 The GSM system and services are described in a set of standards governed by ETSI, where a complete list is made

 This research was done by Joule
 lambaai kaa yah parivartan chumbakeey balakshetra kii disha par nirbhar nahin he
 If a ferromagnetic material is placed on an alternating magnetic field, it will vibrate with its natural or overload frequency and produce a parasitic sound
 chumbakeey shithily ke kaaran vidyucchumbakeey urja kaa parashravya urja main parivartan adhik acha nahin hota he
 Also, in this method the ultrasonic sound of maximum frequency cannot be produced because the substance cannot take the shape of a ring
 vincent or peers, donon main chumbakeey acarantar dwaara parashravya kampan paidaa karne ke liye vidyutiya paripath banaae
 This circuit generates automatic excited electrical oscillation, due to the inverse effect of magnetic shaping, as the elongated decrease of the rod length changes the magnetization and the induced electromagnetic force controls the current of the cube through the grid

 Was established in Hyderabad State, India
 
 AIMIM has won the Hyderabad constituency Lok Sabha seat since 1984
 2014 ke telugana vidhansabha chunaavon main, eimm ne saat siton par jeet hasil kii or bharat ke chunaav ayog dwaara 'rajya party' ke rup main manyata praapt kii
 The president of this party is Asaduddin Owaisi
 majalis ke itihaas ko do hisson main baanta ja saktaa he
 From the founding of Nawab Mahmud Nawaz Khan in 1928 to 1948 while this organization advocated maintaining Hyderabad a separate Muslim state
 is sanghathan ke sansthaapak sadasyon main hyderabad ke rajaneta saiyad kasim rizvi bhi shaamil the jo rajakar naam ke hathiyaarband hinsak sanghathan ke sargana bhi the
 These Razakars played an important role in raising MIM
 rajakar or emm ye donon hi sanghathan hyderabad ke deshadrohi or gaddaar nizaam ke kattar samarthak the
 This is the reason that when the country became independent in 1947, the merger of the princely state of Hyderabad with India was fiercely opposed by Kasim Rizvi and his paramilitary organization i
e
 Razakars
 us par 1948 main hyderabad state ke bharat main vilay ke baad bharat sarkaar ne pratibandh laga diya tha
 And the second part which started after the restoration of this party in 1957 when he added "all India" to his name and also changed his constitution
 Qasim Rajvi, who was the president of the Majlis at the time of the Indian government's crackdown against the state of Hyderabad, was arrested and handed over the reins of this party to Abdul Wahd Owaisi, the then famous lawyer, before leaving for Pakistan
 uske baad se yah party isi parivaar ke haath main rahi he
 abdul vahed ke baad salahuddin ovaisi uske adhyaksh bane or ab unke putr asaduddin ovaisi us ke adhyaksh or saansad hai jab unke chote bhai akbaruddin ovaisi vidhaan sabha main party ke netaa hai
 The leaders of this family and Majlis have been alleging that they have been promoting communal tension in Hyderabad with their provocative speeches
 But on the other hand, supporters of the Majlis see it as the answering power of the Bharatiya Janata Party and other Hindu organizations
 rajnatik shakti ke saath saath ovaisi parivaar ke saadhan or sampatti main bhi jabardast vruddhi hui he jisamen ek medical or ejineering college, kai duusare kalege or do aspataal bhi shaamil hai
 AEMEM recorded its first electoral victory in 1960 when Salahuddin Owaisi was elected to the Hyderabad Municipality and then two years later he became a member of the Legislative Assembly
 The power of the Majlis continued to grow
 badhati hui lokapriyata ke saath saath salahuddin ovaisi "salaar-e-millat" ke naam se mashhoor hue
 varsh 1984 main wo pehali baar hyderabad se lok sabha ke liye chune gaye saath hi vidhaan sabha main bhi us ke sadasyon kii sankhya babbti gai haalaanki kai baar is party par ek sampradayik dal hone ke aarope lage lekin andhra pradesh kii badi rajnatik partia congress or telugudesam donon ne alag alag samay par usase gathbandhan banaae rakhaa
 The interesting thing is that this alliance is still going on in Hyderabad Municipality and Majlis got the post of Mayor with the support of Congress
 2009 ke chunaav main eiemaiem ne vidhaan sabha kii saat siten jeetin jo kii use apane itihaas main milane vaali sab se zyada siten thim

 The Majlis accused the Congress government of adopting anti-muslim policies and withdrew its support from him
 The uproar over Akbaruddin Owaisi's so-called speech and the way he is arrested and sent to jail is being seen in the context of the confrontation between Congress and Majlis
 adhiktar hyderabad tak simit majalis ab apana prabhaav andhra pradesh ke duusare jilon or padosi rajyon maharashtra or karnataka tak failaane kii koshish kar rahi he
 Recently, he created a stir by winning 11 seats in Nanded Municipality of Maharashtra
 The Congress in Andhra Pradesh is troubled by the possibility that AEMEM may join hands with Jaganmohan Reddy's YSR Congress in the 2014 elections
 After the arrest of Akbaruddin Owaisi, there was no possibility of any compromise between the Majlis and the Congress
