 Performance testing is a subset of performance engineering, an emerging practice of computer science, that seeks to elevate performance in system design and structure
 nishpaadan pareekshan vibhinn prayojanon ko puraa kar saktaa he
 He can prove that the system meets the performance criteria
 yah do pranaaliyon kii tulana kar saktaa he ki kis pranali kaa nishpaadan behatar he
 Or it can evaluate which part of the system or workload is causing performance to deteriorate
 nidaan ke maamle main software ejeeniyar, prolifar jaise upkarnon kaa istemaal karte hai taaki parakh saken ki saadhan yaa software ke koun-se hisse karaab nishpaadan ke liye uttaradaayi hai yaa anurakshit sweekaarya anukriya kaal ke liye pravaah-kshamta str siddh kar saken
 nai pranali ke laagat nishpaadan ke liye yah mahatvapurn he ki vikaas pariyojna ke prarambh main hi nishpaadan pareekshan prayaas shuru ho jaaen or pariniojan tak jari rahe
 jitne vilamb se nishpaadan dosha kaa pataa chalata he, utana hi zyaada uske samaadhaan kii laagat hoti he
 This is true in the case of functional testing, but due to the overall nature of its scope of work, the more so for performance testing
 nishpaadan pareekshan main, aksar apekshit vaastavik upyog ke samaan pareekshan dashaon kaa hona mahatvapurn hota he
 However this is not entirely possible in actual practice
 kaaran yah ki utpaadan pranaaliyon ke kaarybhaar kii prakruti yadrichhik hoti he or jabaki pareekshan kaarybhaar is baat kii nakal utaarne kii acchhee koshish karte hai ki utpaadan parivesh main kya hone kii sambhaavna he, lekin is kaarybhaar parivartanshiltaa ko yathavat doharaana asambhav hota he - sivaay sabase saral pranali main
 The loosely-coupled structural implementation has created additional complications with performance testing
 udhyam sevaaon yaa sampattiyon ke liye utpaadan-jaisi sthitiyon ko sahi taur par dohraane ke liye samanvit nishpaadan pareekshan kii aavashyaktaa he
 Due to the complexities and financial and time requirements associated with this activity, some organizations now use such tools in their performance testing environments to understand the capacity and expectations of resources and to validate / validate their quality characteristics
 Conditions and can monitor them
 kai nishpaadan pareekshan, vaastavik nishpaadan lakshyon ke nirdhaaran par vichaar kiye bina hi shuru kiye jate hai
 From a business perspective, the first question should always be "why are we performing performance testing?" Performance goals may vary depending on application technology and purpose, but they should always include some of the following: - yadi ek anuprayog prayoktaaon kii pahchaan kisi login prakriya ke zarie karata he, to sangamiti lakshya ati aavashyak he
 By definition, this is the largest number of concurrent application users, any time the application is expected to support it
 aapke lipibaddh aadan-pradaan kaa kaary-pravaah vaastavik anuprayog sangamiti par asar daal saktaa he, khaskar yadi paraspar kriya vaale hisse main login evam logout gatividhi shaamil hon
 If there is no concept of users in your application, then your performance goal is likely to be based on maximum flow capacity or exchange rate
 ek aam udhaaharan vikipedia jaise web site kaa aakasmik browzing ho saktaa he
 It specifies the time it takes for one application node to respond to another's request
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan hoga brouzar client se web sarwar ko HTTP 'GET' anurodh
anukriya kaal ke maamle main yahi he jise sab lod pareekshan upkaran vastav main maapte hai
 It would be relevant that server response time targets be set between all nodes of the application landscape
 lod pareekshan upkarnon dwaara nipatane ke liye ek kathin vishay, chunki aam taur par unke paas koi avadharana nahin hoti ki ek samyavadhi kii pahchaan ke alaava node ke bheetar kya ho rahaa he, jahaan 'taar par' koi gatividhi nahin hoti he
 Measuring rendering response times typically includes functional test scripts as part of the performance testing scenario, a feature that many load testing tools do not offer
 yah nishpaadan pareekshan kaa sabase saralatam rup he
 Load testing is typically performed to understand the behavior of the application under a specific expected load
 yah bhaar nirdhaarit avadhi main vishisht baar aadan-pradaan karne vaale apekshit prayoktaaon kii samavarti sankhya ho sakati he
 This test will give the response time of all important business exchanges
 If databases, application servers, etc
 are also monitored, then this simple test can point towards any bottlenecks in the application software
 saamanytah yah pareekshan anuprayog paridrishy main kshamta kii upree seemaa ko samajhane ke liye istemaal hota he
 This type of testing is done to determine the strength of the application during times of excessive load and helps application administrators to determine if the current load exceeds the expected maximum limit so that the application can execute properly
 yah pareekshan aam taur par is nirdhaaran ke liye kiya jaataa he ki kya satat apekshit bhaar ko anuprayog sambhaal paaegaa
 kshamta pareekshan ke dauraan, sambhavya risaav kaa pataa lagane ke liye memory upyog par nigaraanee rakhi jaati he
 Also performance degradation is important, but is often overlooked
 arthath, yah sunishchit karne ke liye ki nirantar gatividhi kii kuch lambii avadhi ke baad pravaah kshamta or / yaa anukriya kaal, pareekshan ke shuruuaat kii tulana main acha yaa behatar he
 As the name implies, the spike test is to understand the behavior of the application by testing the strength of the number of users; Whether performance will be affected, application will fail, or it can handle dramatic changes in load
 vinyas pareekshan paaramparik nishpaadan pareekshan kaa ek or roopantaran he
 Instead of testing performance in terms of load, you are testing the impact of configuration changes of the application landscape on application performance and behavior
 ek saamaanya udhaaharan bhaar-santulan ke vibhinn tareekon ke saath prayog karnaa hoga
 While not exclusive to performance testing, the term is used to describe the duplication of test implementations resulting in an application problem
 aksar galati ke prabhaav-kshetra ko alag karne or pushti karne ke liye istemaal hota he
 a stable design of the application, as far as possible that reflects the production environment
 nishpaadan pareekshan parivesh ko UAT yaa vikaas parivesh ke saath jodna nahin chahie
 yah sankatpurna he kyonki yadi usee parivesh main ek UAT yaa samakalan pareekshan yaa anya pareekshan kiya ja rahaa ho, to nishpaadan pareekshan se praapt parinaam vishwasaneey nahin ho sakate
 ek uttam abhyaas ke rup main hameshaa hi yah upyukt hoga ki jitna sambhav ho nishpaadan pareekshan ke liye utpaadan parivesh jaisaa ek alag maahaul uplabdh ho
 Some very common myths are given below
 1
 nishpaadan pareekshan pranali ke krambhang ke liye kiya jaataa he
 Stress testing is done to understand the break-point of the system
 anyathaa apekshit prayokta bhaar ke adheen anuprayog ke vyavhaar ko samajhane ke liye aam taur par saamaanya lod testing kiya jaataa he
 Depending on other requirements such as spike load, spike, endurance soak, or stress testing will be required for a sustained load over extended periods of time
 2
 nishpaadan pareekshan keval system integration testing ke baad kiya janaa chahie
 Although this is mostly an industry standard, performance testing can also be done in the initial development phase of the application
 is tarah ke drushtikon ko praarambhik nishpaadan pareekshan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 This approach will ensure the overall development of the application keeping in mind the performance standards
 Thus the detection of performance bug and cost involved in its improvement can be reduced to a great extent just before the application is released
 3
 nishpaadan pareekshan main keval lipiyaan shaamil hoti hai or kisi bhi anuprayog parivartan se lipiyon ke saamaanya rifactering kii zarurat hogi
 Performance testing itself is a developing science in the software industry
 lipikaran haalanki apane aap main mahatvapurn he, par nishpaadan pareekshan main vah keval ghatakon main se ek he
 The major challenge for any performance tester is determining the type of probe to be implemented and the analysis of various performance counters to determine performance bottlenecks
 anuprayog parivartan se sambandhit myth kaa doosraa khand ki iske parinamswaroop keval lipiyon main thodi rifactering kii zarurat hogi, bhi galat he, kyonki UI main kisi bhi rup main parivartan kii vajah se, khaskar web protocol main, lipiyon ko dubaara shuru se punarviksit karne kii zarurat hogi
 yah samasya badi ho jaati he, agar isamen aaveshtit protocol main shaamil hon web seva, sibel, web clic and script, citrix, SAP
 Performance testing technology deploys one or more pcs or Unix servers to act as injectors - each simulating the presence of numerous users and running an automated sequence of interactions with each host whose execution Is being tested Typically, a separate PC acts as a test operator, coordinating and storing the matrix from each injector and matching performance data for reporting purposes
 saamaanya anukram he bhaar ko badhanaa - abhaasi prayoktaaon kii ek choti sankhya ke saath shuru karte hue or kuch adhiktam avadhi tak sankhya ko badhanaa
 pareekshan parinaam darshaate hai ki bhaar ke saath nishpaadan kis tarah badalata rahata he, jo prayoktaaon kii sankhya banaam anukriya kaal ke rup main diya jaataa he
 Various tools are available to execute such tests
 is shrenee main aam taur par upkaran pareekshanon kii ek aisi vyavastha ko anjaam dete hai, jo pranali ke prati asli upyogkartaaon kaa anukaran karata he
 Sometimes the results reveal some discrepancies, for example, while the average response time may be acceptable, there are some majorly different exchanges that take a long time to complete - which may be due to inefficient database queries, Be due to pictures etc
 nishpaadan pareekshan ko tanaav pareekshan ke saath sanyukt kiya ja saktaa he, taaki dekh saken ki jab ek sweekaarya bhaar adhik ho jaataa he - to kya system krash hota he? agar baari boj ko kam kiya jaae, to thik hone main kitna samay lagata he? kya yah is tarah vifal hota he ki samparshvik kshati pahunchati he? Analytical performance modeling is a method of modeling the behavior of an application in a spreadsheet

 The measured exchanged resource demand is added to find the hourly resource demand and divided by the hourly resource capacity to obtain the resource load
 anukriya kaal sutara, R=anukriya kaal, S=seva kaal, U=bhaar) kaa upyog karte hue anukriya samay kii gananaa kii ja sakati he or nishpaadan pareekshanon ke parinaamon ke saath anshashodhit kiya ja saktaa he
 Analytical performance modeling allows evaluation of design options and system sizing based on actual or anticipated business usage
 isliye yah nishpaadan pareekshan se zyaada tej or sasta he, haalanki iske liye hardware plateform ko puri tarah se samajhane kii aavashyaktaa he
 This is important for specifying performance specifications and their documentation in an execution test plan

 For more information, see Performance Engineering
 haalanki, nishpaadan pareekshan ko aksar kisi vinirdesan ke prati nishpadit nahin kiya jaataa arthath kisi ne abhivyakt nahin kiya hoga ki prayoktaaon kii kisi vishisht sankhya ke liye adhiktam sweekaarya anukriya kaal kya hona chahie
 nishpaadan pareekshan kaa upyog aksar nishpaadan profil tuning kii prakriya ke hisse ke rup main kiya jaataa he
 The idea here is to identify the "weak link" - of course, any part of the system that, if it is arranged to respond quickly, can result in the overall system running faster
 kabhi-kabhi yah pahchaanana ek kathin kaary hota he ki pranali kaa koun-sa hissaa is mahatvapurn maarg kaa pratinidhitiv karata he or kuch pareekshan upkarnon main inastrumentation shaamil hota he jo sarwar par chalata he or aadan-pradaan samay, databes abhigam samay, upari network or anya sarwar monitor kii report dete hai, jinka kachche nishpaadan aankadon ke saath vishleshan kiya ja saktaa he
 Without such a tool, one has to lean on the Windows Task Manager on the server to see how much CPU load the performance tests are generating
 ek aisi company kaa qissa he jisane samasya kaa uchit vishleshan kiye bina hi apane software ke anukulan ke liye ek badi raashi kharch kii
 antat unhen pranali ke ‘niskriy loop’ ko dubaara likhnaa padaa, jahaan unhone paaya ki pranali kaa adhikansh samay kharch hota he, par phir bhi duniya ke sabase kushal niskriy loop ke saath, jaahir he samgr nishpaadan main ek kan bhi sudhaar nahin hua! Performance testing can be performed across the web and even performed in different parts of the country, as it is believed that the response of the Internet varies from region to region
 ise karyaalay ke bheetar bhi kiya ja saktaa he, haalanki tab saarvajanik network par samanytah lagu hone ke samaan, antaraal ko pravesh karaane ke liye routers ke vinyas kii zarurat hogi
 yathartwaadee bindu se bhaar ko pranali main pravartit karnaa chahie
 udhaaharan ke liye, yadi pranali ke 50% prayokta aadhaar 56K modem conection ke zarie pranali tak pahunch rahe hon or shesh aadhe T1 ke zarie, to lod injector unheen conekshnon par bhaar pahunchaaen yaa usee prayokta profil kaa anusaran karte hue, aise conekshnon kii network avyaktata kaa anukaran karen
 The statement about the probable peak number of users will always be helpful, who are likely to use the system during peak hours
 yadi aisa bayaan bhi mil jaae ki anukriya kaal kaa adhiktam anumey 95 pratishat kisase gathit he, to ek injector vinyas kaa upyog yah jaanchane ke liye kiya ja saktaa he ki kya prastaavit pranali us vinirdesan ko puraa karti he
 Performance specifications should ask at least the following questions: aise pareekshan ke liye kiye jane vaale kaaryon main shaamil honge: According to the Microsoft Developer Network, Performance Testing Methodology includes the following activities: 2793 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year of 2793 BC or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he
 In most of the world old years are calculated based on this method
