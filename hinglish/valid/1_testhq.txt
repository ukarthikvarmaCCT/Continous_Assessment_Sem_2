 In fact, these reactions are methods of substituting one or more hydrogen atoms in alkaline or alkyl groups in the brazene ring
 in abhikriyaayein mukhya rup se do prakaar kii hai - elkylikaran abhikriyaayein tathaa acelikaran abhikriyaayein
 The general reaction process of these reactions is shown below- yaa, There are three different parts of this reaction- aromatic yogic - iskaa elkylikaran karnaa hota he, jisamen hydrocarbon yaa unke hellojan, hydroxi, amino aadi vyutpann ho sakate hai
 Asymmetric cyclic compounds can also be alkylated
 elkylikaarak - yah alkil kellide, elifatic alcohol, alkeen yaa chakree alaken ho sakate hai
 Catalyst - The best catalyst for this reaction is anhydrous aluminum chloride, but additionally zinc, tin chloride, boron trifluoride, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid can also be used
 C6H5 + CH3 Cl + ---> C6H5
 CH3 + hcl C6H6 + Cl CH2 Cl + C6H6 + ---> C6H5 c H2 C6H5 + 2hcl 3C6H6+C h Cl3 + ---> 3 c h+3hcl C6H6 + ch3cocl + ---> C6H5 COCH3 + hcl C6H6 + ch3cocl ---> C6H5 COCH3 + hcl C6H6 + C6H5 cocl ---> C6H5 CO C6 H5 + hcl 2C6H6 + cocl2 ---> C6H5 CO
 C6 H5 + 2hcl C6H6 + cocl2 ---> C6H5 cocl + ---> C6H5 COOH kriyafal utprerak par nirbhar he
 C6H5 CH3 + CH3 Cl ---> C6H4 2 C6H5 ch3+ch3cl ---> C6H4 2 Alkyl halide - Their activity is as follows
 fluoride > chloride > bromide > iodide With all, tritiyak hellide > dwitiyak hellide > praathmik hellide Solvent - If the reactant is in liquid form, the solvent is not required, but a solvent is required to be used with compounds of solid form
 nitrobenzin, carbon dicelphide, petroleum ether achche vilaayak hai
 Inclusion of alkyne groups - Under this action the primary alkyl halide is converted into secondary and secondary tertiary, so whether propyl chloride or isopropyl chloride, these actions will result in isopropyl benzene

 যদি কেউ কথা না কয়, ওরে ও অভাগা, যদি সবাই থাকে মুখ ফিরায়ে সবাই করে ভয় —- তবে পরান খুলেও তুই মুখ ফুটে তোর মনের কথা একলা বলো রে॥ যদি সবাই ফিরে যায়, ওরে ওরে ও অভাগা,যদি গহন পথে যাবার কালে কেউ ফিরে না চায়—তবে পথের কাঁটাও তুই রক্তমাখা চরণতলে একলা দলো রে
 যদি আলো না ধরে, ওরে ওরে ও অভাগা, যদি ঝড়-বাদলে আঁধার রাতে দুয়ার দেয় ঘরে- তবে বজ্রানলে আপন বুকের পাঁজর জ্বালিয়ে নিয়ে একলা জ্বলো রে

 vaidic-samskruti satya, sanathan he or veda ko anadi athwa ishwariya mana gaya he 
 | Because the oldest history about man and his civilization is also the result of this culture
 In which the rishis were given a system of decent conduct to run the human society in an orderly manner, whereas in today's age there is a total lack of dignity
 This is why Vedic culture has maintained its existence from time to time
 Which is surprising but also true
 bharatvarsh main rahane vaali sarvapratham jati arya thi or aaryon kii apni samskruti vaidic samskruti hi thi | chunki ye samskruti aaj bhi utani hi shashakt, subyavasthit, susangathit or anushaasit he, jitani ki sristi ke udai ke samay | yahi pramukh kaaran rahaa he ki, vaidic-samskruti ko vishwa patal par aaj bhi sammanit drushti se dekha jaataa he | vaidic-samskruti main paanch yama hai or paanch niyam hai | Yama: - 1
 Truth, 2
 Ahimsa, 3
 Astheya, 4
 Brahmacharya, 5
 Aparigraha niyam :- 1
 shouch, 2
 santosh, 3
 swadhyay, 4
 ishwar-pranidhan, 5
 tap | According to Vedic culture, the welfare of man who disregards these Yama-rules is impossible, just like that; Just as defying these Yama-rules does not prove any religious work
 That is, Yama-niyam is the first lesson of Vedic culture in the spiritual world and is like the foundation stone of a building
 As a result of this, the entire world has been called the whole world, "dharmaguru"
 Because history is a witness to the fact that the best Vedic culture is considered to be the best of all cultures or civilizations since the existence of the universe
 Because its acceptance is clearly visible in all religions and in scientific inventions and hypotheses till date

 There are many constants in physics, about which scientists believe that there is no change in them over time
 in niyantaakon ko bhautikee ke moulik niyatank kehete hai
 Whatever is their value according to our chosen fundamental units, will always remain the same
 aise niyatankon ke kuch udhaaharan ye hai: prakaash kaa veg, arthath vah veg jisase prakaash kii tarangon kaa sancharan shunyakash main hota he; electron kaa aavesh; sarvyaapee gurutvakarshan kaa niyatank, arthath vah bal jisase ek centimetre kii duuri par rakhe ek gram ke do pind ek duusare ko aakarshith karte hai; ooshmaagatiki paimaane par barf vindu, arthath barf ke pighalane kaa taap aadi
 There are also some fundamental physical constants whose numerical values are the same in all unit systems; These are called non-physical physical constants
 in niyatankon ke maanon kaa vistrut vivechan sabase pehle barj ne san 1929 main kiya
 Since the study done by Dunnington in 1939, such study is done every second or third year
 in adhyayanon main sabase acchhee baat yah hui he ki in niyatankon kaa maan na keval uttarottar shuddhta se gyaat kiya ja sakaa he, apitu yah bhi hua he ki inke naveen maan puraane nirdhaarit maanon kii trutiyon ke antargat hi praapt hue hai
 Many scientists have been trying to find the exact value of these constants for a long time
 san 1929 ke pehle prayek niyatank ko ek pruthak samasya ke rup main gyaat kiya ja rahaa tha
 But these constants have interrelations, which can be used to check if there are any inconsistencies in the values of these constants
 udhaahrant:, proton kaa chumbakeey aghurna p prayogon dwaara mapa ja saktaa he
 This magnetic moment can also be manifested by other constants, whose formula is p = eh / p mp c It contains e, h, mp and C, respectively, the charge of the electron, the planar constant, the concentration of the proton and the velocity of light
 in niyatankon kaa maan bhi prayog dwaara gyaat kiya ja saktaa he
 Since there is a possibility of a slight error in measuring, it may be that the number obtained when the values of e, h, mp and c in the formula are not equal to the value of p determined by the experiment
 isaliye in sabhi niyatankon kaa maan is tarah nishchit kiya janaa chahie ki yah antar kam se kam ho
 Here is only one example of this mutual relationship
 isi tarah in niyatankon main or bhi sambandh hote hai
 The largest group of these interrelated constants is the atomic constant
 kuch ko chhodkar lagbhag sabhi niyatank inhen niyatankon dwaara prakat kiye ja sakate hai
 The most important constant, which cannot be revealed by them, is the constant of gravity
 in niyatankon main se kuch aise mukhya niyatank chune jate hai, jinke dwaara duusare niyatankon ko prakat kiya ja saktaa he
 Suppose the number of such prime constants is z
 ab kuch aisi matraayen chuni jaati hai jinka maan prayog dwaara badi yatharthata se mapa ja saktaa he or jinhen in chune hue mukhya niyatankon dwaara prakat kiya ja saktaa he
 An example of one such quantity is the magnetic moment of protons, which is mentioned above
 in chuni hui matraaon kii sankhya kam se kam ya honi chahie
 But if the number of such selected quantities is more than "Y", then we will have more equations than necessary to get the value of these constants
 aisi dasha main yadi ham kinhin "ya" samikarnon main inako rakhen, to ham dekhenge ki gananaa dwaara praapt kiye gaye maanon evam prayog dwaara praapt kiye gaye maanon main antar he
 That is why we should find the value of these constants that the "math values" and "experimental values" of these chosen quantities have a minimum discrepancy
 iske liye in niyatankon ke maan kaa nirdhaaran nunatam-varg-reeti dwaara kiya jaataa he

 akeshwarwad athwa ekadevvaad vah siddhanth he jo 'ishwar ek he' athwa 'ek ishwar he' vichaar ko sarvapramukh rup main manyata detaa he
 The monotheist believes in only one God and only worships him
 iske saath hi vah kisi bhi aisi anya alokik shakti yaa devtaa ko nahin maanata jo us ishwar kaa samakaksh ho sake athwa uskaa sthaan le sake
 Accordingly, polytheism is called the opposite principle of monotheism
 akeshwarwad ke virdohi darshanik matvaadon main darshanik sarveshwarawad, darshanik nirishwarwad tathaa darshanik ndehwaad kii gananaa kii jaati he
 Sarveshvaradism assumes an integrality between God and the world
 uske siddhanthavakya hai- 'sab ishwar hai' tathaa 'ishwar sab hai'
 Monotheism only assumes the authority of one God
 sarveshwarawad ishwar or jagat donon kii satta maanata he
 Although there is validity in the nature of the power of the world, but one definitely accepts the unity of God and the world
 'ishwar ek he' vaakya kii sookshm darshanik mimasaa karne par yah kaha ja saktaa he ki sarvasatta ishwar he
 This conclusion is close to Sarveshvarism
 isiilie ye vaakya ek hi tathy ko do dhang se prakat karte hai
 a comparative study of these shows that the sentence 'god is one' indicates the fullness of God, while the sentence 'all is God' is towards the omnipresence of God
 deshkalgat prabhaav kii drushti se vichaar karne par ishwar ke teen visham roopon ke anusaar teen prakaar ke akeshwarwad kaa bhi ullekh miltaa he- Of these, the third monotheism is the most widespread and it is very closely related to Sarveshvarism
 yah siddhant keval ishwar kii hi purna satta par jor nahin detaa, apitu jagat kii asatta par bhi jor detaa he; kintu vibhinn darshanik drushtiyon se vah jagat kii satta or asatta donon kaa do prakaar ke satyon ke rup main pratipaadan bhi karata he
 Due to the equal emphasis on the inability of the world, some people consider the use of the term 'monism' more relevant for Hindu Sarveshvarism, seeing it near monotheism
 is drushti se jagat kii satta keval pratiti maatr he
 Historically many characteristics are seen in Hindu monotheism
 kalanusaar unke anek rup milte hai
 Sarveshvarism and polytheism are closely interlinked
 kuch log vikascram kii drushti se bahudevvaad ko sarvapratham sthaan dete hai
 In the development of Indian religion and contemplation, one can imagine the ultimate power of polytheism in the early Vedic era and behind all the gods in the later Vedic age
 duusare mat se yadhyapi vaidic devataaon ke bahutv ko dekhakar saamaanya pathak vedon ko bahudevvaadi kah saktaa he tathaapi prabud adhyeta ko unamem na to bahudevvaad kaa darshan hoga or na hi akeshwarwad kaa
 That is such a state of Indian apostasy that both of them can be considered as an example
 vastut: yah dharmik sthiti itani viksit nahin thi ki ukt donon main se kisi ek kii ore vah unmukh ho sake
 But as the tendency towards the seriousness of the religion grew, so too did the tendency of Indian thought towards monotheism
 karmkandi karm swat: apana fal pradaan karte hai, is dharna ne bhi bahudevvaad ke devataaon kii mahatta ko kam kiya
 In the Upanishad period, the thinking of a god or power became dominant when theology was propagated
 puranakaal main anek devataaon kii manyata hote hue bhi, unamem se kisi ek ko pradhan maanakar uski upasna par jor diya gaya
 After the predominance of Vedanta philosophy, polytheistic beliefs became even more debilitated and the principle of a single God or power became prominent
 inhen aadhaaron par kuch log akeshwarwad ko gambhir chintna kaa fal maanate hai
 In fact, considering the entire Indian religion, thinking and literature, the prevalence of Sarveshwarism is universally reflected
 yah bhartiya matvaad yadhyapi janprachlit bahudevvaad se bahut dur he tathaapi anya deshon kii tarah yahan bhi sarveshwarawad bahudevvaad se naikatay sthapit kar rahaa he
 The Mahabharata's Narayaniyopakhyana describes the white continent as endowed with monotheistic devotion
 vishvaksen samhita ne vaidikon kii, ekadevvaadi na hone tathaa vaidic karmkandi vidhaanon main vishwaas karne ke kaaran, katu aalochana kii he
 Similarly, another form of monotheism is found in Indian religious practice
 pehle brahma, vishnu or mahesh kii vibhinnata pratipaadit ho gai, saath hi kahin-kahin vishnu or brahma ko shiv main samavisht bhi mana gaya
 Over time, a sense of unity also developed
 keval shiv main hi shesh donon devataaon ke gunon kaa aarope ho gaya
 a similar allegation is found in relation to Vishnu
 vishnupurana to teenon ko ek paramatma kii abhivyakti maanata he
 This divine is somewhere in the form of Shiva and somewhere in the form of Vishnu
 doosraa atiprasiddh akeshwarwad islamic he
 Only by accepting the power of God, does it believe that polytheism is a great sin
 ishwar ek he
