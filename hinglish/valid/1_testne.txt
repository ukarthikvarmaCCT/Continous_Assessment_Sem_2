 aavesh sangrakshan kaa siddhant benjamin franklin ne khoja tha
 Accordingly, electric charge can neither be generated nor destroyed
 atah vidyut aavesh brahmand main sadaiv hi sangrakshit rahata he
 In practice, charge protection is a physical law according to which the total difference in electric charge in a certain volume is exactly equal to the difference between the charge and the charge released from that volume
 ganit ke anusaar, is siddhant ko nirantarata sameekaran ke rup main likh sakate hai: q is the amount of electric charge that occurs in t time in a certain volume, QIN is the amount of charge coming in that volume between time t1 and t2 and QOUT is the amount of charge going out of that volume at the same time
 sadish avkalan kaa prayog is siddhant kaa aavesh ghanatv ρ evam vidyut dhara ghanatv j kii terms main pratipaadan karne hetu prayog kiya ja saktaa he: This statement is equivalent to a conservation of four-current
 In the mid-nineteenth century, James Clerk Maxwell postulated the existence of electromagnetic waves as a result of his discovery that Ampère's law was inconsistent with the conservation of charge
 After correctly reformulating Ampère's law, Maxwell also realized that such waves would travel at the speed of light, and that light itself must be a form of electromagnetic radiation
 See electromagnetic wave equation for a full discussion of these discoveries

 The word comes from the Arabic language and means "report", "accounting" or "riyavat"

 Hadiths are not the only collection
 ahadis alag-alag hadison ke sangrah ko darshata he, or islam kii vibhinn shakhaaen hadison ke vibhinn sangrahon se paraamarsh leti hai jabaki koraniyat kaa ek apekshaakrit chota paksh kisi bhi haddees sangrah ke pramaan ko puri tarah se asweekaar karata hai
 For the religion of Islam and all the Muslims of the world, if any book is of the highest importance after the Holy Qur'an, then the Hadiths are, for some, it is as much as the Qur'an which believes that every statement of Prophet Muhammad is every thing of his
 There are divine messages without which it is not possible to understand the Qur'an, that is, their words are understood in the behavioral detail of the Qur'an
 islam or ek uski ke mul granth koran main adhiktar vishyon par jo aadesh-nirdesh, siddhant, niyam, kaanoon, shikshaayen, pichhali qaiimon ke vrittant, rasulon ke aahnan or sristi va samaaj se sambandhit baton tathaa akeshwaratv ke tark, anekeshwaratv ke khandan or paralok-jivan aadi kii charchaa hui he, vah sankshep main he
 According to Islam, God placed the responsibility of a detailed explanation of all this on the Prophet
 hazarat paigambar mohammad ke samay unke saath rahane vaale unke saathi unki baaten unke tareeke likh liya yaa yaad kar liya karte the isi ko haddees kaha gaya, baad main haddees or fiqah ke jaankaar imaamon ne in hadiso ko sangrah kar ke ek jagah laa diya
 One of the many reasons for the disorder that had occurred in earlier religious texts, when Islam re-emerged with the conversion of Hazrat Muhammad to Rasul, was that ish-vani, the statement of Rasool and others The statements of humans and religious leaders, preachers, readers, reformers and theologians, etc
 were also mixed together
 ishvani or manushya-vaani ke mishran main, mul ish-granth kitna he or iske ansh koun-koun se hai, yah pataa lagaana asambhav ho gaya tha
 According to a hadith narrated by the Prophet's companion Hazrat Abu Salma, you had given a stern warning to the hadith narrators that haddees ke nimnlikhit chah vishwasaneey sangrah hai jinamein 29,578 hadisen sangrahit hai : The collections of hadiths are generally compiled by chapters on the basis of topics, these topics are based on every aspect of life, every field
 in sangrahon ke baad bahut hi bade paimaane par in hadison kii vyakhya par vyapak sahitya taiyaar kiya gaya he
 Then, books covering various topics have been prepared
 is prakaar ek vishaal haddees-sahitya taiyaar ho chukaa he
 These collections and literature are an essential part of the curriculum of Islamic schools
 goshtiyon, baithkon, sabhaaon main puure vishwa main haddees paath ke prayojan kiye jate hai
 In this way the knowledge of Hadith and its teachings flow continuously in Muslim society

 In this way, he started din-i-ilahi with the good things of all religions

 This creates differences among themselves
 jitne dharm utane hi dal hai
 There is enmity between them and hence coordination is required in all religions
 parantu ise aise dhang se karnaa chahie ki ek hote hue bhi unki visheshta bani rahe
 With this, the goodness of all religions will remain and the characteristics of other religions will also come

 But the Mediterranean president of the British Navy was chasing Commander Nelson Napoleon efficiently
 usne aage badhkar francisiyon ko nil nadi ke yuddh main teetar-bitar kar diya tathaa turki ko bhi englad kii ore se yuddh main pravesh karne ke liye vivash kar diya
 Nelson's success gave Britain the opportunity to form a second bloc, and the nations of Europe, which Napoleon had suppressed, began preparing for a campaign against France
 turki ke yuddh main pravisht ho jane par napolian ne syria kaa abhiyaan chhedaa
 With only a limited contingent of thirteen thousand marched towards Acker but stopped by a skilled fighter like Sidney Smith
 yah napolian ke liye vardaan siddh hua
 Now Napoleon was involved in the creation of another French empire in Syria
 kintu france is samay ek najuk sthiti se guzar rahaa tha
 Therefore, Napoleon considered it desirable to appear in France, despite being successful in establishing his power in Egypt
 napolian ke france main pravesh karte hi halchal paidaa ho gai
 Finding a favorable environment, in November 1799, Napoleon seized power and disbanded the directory and enacted a new legislation
 is vidhaan ke anusaar teen kaunsal niyukt hue
 After some time all the powers were concentrated in the first Council Napoleon
 france ek deergh ashaanti se thak chukaa tha tathaa kranti ko sthapitv kii ore le jane ke liye antarkalin shanti param aavashyak thi
 But before the peace was established, an Italian campaign was necessary to defeat Austria

 Now the second bloc broke out and Napoleon made a treaty of Amiens from England in 1801 AD, under which the two nations returned each other's conquered territories
 ab nepolian ne ek sudhaar yojana karyanvit kar france ko shashan or vyavastha di
 Disciplined the economic condition of France

 Strengthened the land system
 paris kaa saundaryikaran kiya
 Made considerable changes in the army and gave a scientific basis to the French system, which is still known as the Napoleonic Code
 pope se ek con courdet kar catholic jagat kaa samarthan praapt kar liya
 Napoleon achieved considerable success with these reforms and in March 1804 he became the Emperor of France
 is ghatana se saare europe main ek halchal paidaa hui
 Again the war between France and Britain began to cloud
 napolian ne england par akraman karne ke liye uttari samudri tat par bolon main apni sena bheji
 England awakened to the north of its naval contingent on the English Channel and then surprised Napoleon at every encounter
 aamiain kii sandhi ke samaapt hote hi wiliam pit shashan main aayaa or usne england, austria, yas aadi rashtron ko milakar ek tritiy gut banaaya
 Napoleon then barricaded against Austria and ended the Republic of Sisalpine and assumed the position of King of Italy himself
 austria ko ulm ke yuddh main haraaya
 Francis, the ruler of Austria, fled and took refuge in the Tsar
 idhar trafalgar ke yuddh main nelson ne napolian kii jalsena ko haraa diya tha, jisase austria ko phir se napolian ko chunauti dene kaa mauka mil gaya tha
 But when Austerlitz was defeated in the war, Austria had to accept a shameful treaty of the press class
 is safalataa se napolian kaa ullas bad gaya or ab usne germany ko raudna prarambh kiya
 He strengthened the rule of his brother Joseph Bonaparte by creating the Treaty of Rhine, defeating the wars of Jena and Arsed in 14 October 1806
 ab keval rus rah gaya jise napolian ne june 1807 i main freedland ke yuddh main haraakar july 1807 kii tilsit kii sandhi ke liye vivash kiya
 Once the master of all Europe, Napoleon waged an economic war to defeat England
 saare europe ke rashtron kaa vyapaar england se band kar diya tathaa europe kii sari seemaa par ek kathor niyantran lagu kiya
 Britain promulgated a prohibitive command to stop France's trade with the nations of Europe to its north
 britain ne apni kshatipurti upaneveshon se vyapaar badha kar kar lee, kintu europea rashtron kii aarthik sthiti bigadane lagi or ve france kii is yatnaa se peedit ho uthe
 Spain first revolted against this system

 This sparked a national uprising in Spain

 Russia's rebellion proved disastrous for Napoleon

 Upon returning to Paris, Napoleon again collected an army, but was again defeated at Leipzig by the united armies of Prussia, Russia and Austria
 chaaron ore rashtriya sangram chhid jane se vah sakriy rup se kisi ek raashtra ko na dabaa sakaa tathaa 1814 i main alba dweep bhej diya gaya
 The Allied forces were not able to return even after it was reported that Napoleon's century-long rule began
 at: mitra rashtron ne use 1815 main waterlu ke yuddh main haraakar saint helena kaa karawas diya
 He died there on May 5 in 1821
 nepolian bonapart ne 1799 main satta ko haathon main lekar apni sthiti sudrudh karne tathaa france ko prashasnic sthayitv pradaan karne ke liye vibhinn kshetron main sudhaar kiye
 In fact, the Nepalese had taken over power by ending the rule of the directory and the people of France had accepted that change, then the reason was that it had grown from chaos and chaos
 atah nepolian ke liye yah jaruri tha ki vah aantarik kshetra main ek suvyavasthit shashan or kanoon vyavastha kii sthapana kare
 After becoming First Counsel, Napoleon created a new Constitution for France which was the fourth constitution of the Revolution era
 iske dwaara karypalika shakti teen kanusalaron main nihit kar di gai
 The Principal Counsel had more power than other Counselors
 vastav main samvidhan main ganatantr kaa dikhaaya to jarur tha lekin rajya kii sampoorn satta nepalian ke haathon main kendrit thi
 Napoleon centralized the governance and abolished the local governments of the Departments and Districts and appointed the prefects and sub-prefects
 inaki niyukti tathaa gaanv or shaharon ke sabhi meyaron kii niyukti sidhe kenndriya sarkaar dwaara kii jane lagi
 In this way, Napoleon, the administration's field, kept adequate control over these officers and kept the administration in order and appointed them on the basis of merit
 prashasnic kshetron main nepolian ke sudhaar ek prakaar se kranti ke virdohi ke rup main the kyonki neshnal essembali ne kranti ke dauraan prashasnic dhaanche kaa purna vikendrikaran kar diya tha tathaa desh kaa shashan chalaane kaa daayitv nirvaachit pratinidhiyon ko diya gaya tha lekin nepalian ne is vyavastha ko ulat diya or krantipurv vyavastha ko phir se sthapit kiya
 From that point of view he was a laughingstock of revolution
 nepolian ne france kii jarjar aarthik sthiti se use ubaarane kaa praytn kiya
 In this sequence, he first simplified the tax system
 kar vasuulne kaa kaary kendriya karmchaariyon ke jimme kiya tathaa uski vasuuli sakhti se kii jane lagi
 He prohibited unfair profits in bribery, betting, contracting
 usne mitvyayita par bal diya or france kii janata par anek apratyaksh kar lagaae
 Napoleon established the Bank of France to carry out the financial activities in France, which still exists today
 rashtriya rin ko chukaane ke liye usne ek pruthak kosh kii bhi sthapana kii
 As far as possible Napoleon put the burden of military expenditure on the conquered territories and tried to keep the French people free from this burden
 nepolian ne krishi ke sudhaar par bhi bal diya or banjar or retile ilaake ko upjau banane kii yojana banaai
 Napoleon paid considerable attention to the means of transport for the development of trade
 sadaken, naharen banavaai gai vibhinn prakaar ke vyavsaayon kii pragati ke liye yantric shiksha kii vyavastha kii
 To popularize French industrial goods, encouraged the exhibition and encouraged indigenous goods and industries
 berogari kii samasya ko dur karne ke liye nirmaan kaary ko protsaahan diya
 In this way Napoleon recovered France from a state of shabby and insolvency
 kintu aarthik sudhaaron kii drushti se bhi nepolian ke kaary kranti virdohi dikhaai dete hai
 In the Revolution, emphasis was placed on direct taxes, while Napoleon tried to establish an archaic system by emphasizing indirect taxes
 isi prakaar nepolian ne vanijyivaadee darshan ko praathamikta dekar krantivirdohi maansikta kaa pradarshan kiya
 He believed that the state would have to take active intervention to bring balance between the security of the fund and trade, whereas the force of revolution was on free trade
 nepalian aise nagarikon ko chahta tha jo uske evam uske tantra ke prati vishwaas rakhe
 For this, he made reforms by adopting national and secular forms of education
 shiksha ko praathmik, madhyamik or ucch staron par sangathit kiya
 These schools run with the help of teachers appointed by the government, used to have the same curriculum, the same textbooks and the same uniform
 nepolian ne paris main ek vishvavidhyalay kii sthapana kii or usamen latin, french, vigyaan, ganit ityadi vishyon kii shiksha di jaati thi
 This university was not a university in the general sense of the university, but made a system to unite all the institutions from primary to higher education
 shiksha par adhikadhik sarkari niyantran rakhana tathaa vidhyaarthiyon ko shashan ke prati nishthavan bananaa iskaa uddeshy tha
 Napoleon founded the Institute of France for research work
 nepolian kii nari shiksha main koi ruchi nahin dikhaai
 The burden of their education was left to religious institutions
 france kii bahusankhyak janata catholic carch ke prabhaav main thi
 During the revolution, the power of the church was weakened and brought under the kingdom
 carch kii sampati kaa rashtriyakaran kar diya gaya or padariyon ko rajya kii vafadari kii shapath lene ko kaha gaya
 This angered the Pope and incited the general public to protest
 faltah sarkaar or aamajanata ke bich tanaav paidaa ho gaya
 Napoleon made a pact with the Pope from 1801 called Concardate to overcome it
 uske nimnlikhit praavdhaan the
 Napoleon's most important and permanent work was the creation of the Code of Law
 vastutah kranti ke pehle france kii kanoon vyavastha chhin-bhinn thi or itane prakaar ke kanoon the ki kanoon kaa paalan karaane waalon ko bhi unka gyaan nahin tha or kranti ke dauraan bhi yah araajaktaa bad gai thi
 Napoleon overcame this chaos
 swayan nepolian apni vidhi samhita ko apane 40 yudhon se adhik shaktishaalee maanata tha
 By this code Napoleon established the universal law system in France
 naagarik samhita ke tahat usne parivaar ke mukhiya kaa adhikaar sudrudh kiya
 Women are placed under men and the husband's job is to protect the wife
 talaak kii paddati ko kathin banaaya gaya
 Civil marriage was also arranged in this code
 is prakaar civil vivaah or talaak kii pratha ko manyata dekar nepolian ne europe main is baat kaa prachlan kiya ki bina padariyon ke sahyog ke bhi samaaj kaa kaam chal saktaa he
 Thus other codes such as the Code of Criminal Proc
 Etc
 were created
 uske vyapaarik code main shramjiviyon ke hiton kii upeksha kii gai thi or unke sanghon par pratibandh ko jari rakhaa gaya tha
 In this view Napoleon worked against the ideals of revolution
 iske baavjood is vidhi samhita kii mahatta samooche desh main kanoon kii ekarupata pradaan karne tathaa vyaavhaarik rup se nyaay vyavastha ko aasaan banane main thi
 This code was enforced wherever Napoleon's armies went and remained intact even after Napoleon's defeat
 yah nepolian kii ek sthaayee kirti he
 Napoleon's Code of Law emphasizes the interests of the bourgeoisie more
 bhoomi sambandhi adhikari ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyakti sampati kii raksha ko or majboot banaaya gaya or vyaktigat sampati kii raksha ke liye kai kanoon banaae
 Creating a trade union was declared a crime
 mukademen kii sthiti main mazdooron kii daleelon ke badale maalikon kii baton ko nyaayalayon ko maanane ko kaha gaya
 Social equality is also the basis of the civil code
 visheshadhikaar or saamanti niyam kaa samhita main koi sthaan nahin tha
 There was not even a law to consider the elder son as the heir to the property, all the sons were given equal rights on the property
 nepolian ne samaaj main ek naveen kuleen varg kii sthapana kii
 He determined the order of titles according to income
 nepolian kaa yah kaary kranti ke aadarshon ke vipareet tha
 Napoleon's appearance on the European political horizon was like a wandering wheel and he soon became the destiny of Europe on the strength of his process and hard work
 usamen adbhut sainik tathaa prashasnic kshamta se sabhi kochakit kar diya
 But his pillar of strength was like standing on the sand wall
 jo kuch hi varshon main dhwast ho gaya vastut: nepolian kaa utthan or patan chakachaundh karne vaali ulka ke samaan hua
 He shone in the sky of Europe on the strength of military success, but with defeat, the star of his destiny sank
 jis samrajya kii kathin parishram ke pashchaat kaayam kiya gaya tha vah dekhte hi dekhte samaapt ho gaya uske patan ke anek kaaran the jo sa prakaar he
 Infinitely ambitious nepolian aseem mahatvakankshi tha
 The infinite great ambition proves to be the main cause of a person's downfall
 nepolian ke saath bhi yahi baat thi
 As the war progressed, his ambition increased and he began to dream of establishing a world state
 yadi thode se hi vah santusht ho jaataa or jite hue samrajya kii dekhbhaal karata or apana samay usamen lagaataa to use patan kaa durdasha nahin dekhnaa padataa
 Character weakness nepolian main saahas sanyam or dhairya kut- kut kar bharaa tha parantu uski drushti main ghrinaa uskaa pratishodh uskaa kartavya tathaa kshamaadaan kalank tha
 The great weakness of his character was that he did not consider the treaty to be a respected agreement
 kisi bhi desh kii maitri uske liye raajnneetik aavashyaktaa se adhik nahin thi
 Gradually he became stubborn
 He believed that every step of his was okay
 vah kabhi bhul nahin kar saktaa vah dusron kii salaah kii upeksha karne laga
 As a result, his true friends also went away from him
 nepolian kii vyavastha kaa sanyavad par aadhaarit hona- His political system was based on militarism which proved to be the primary cause of its downfall
 vah sabhi maamalon main sena par nirbhar rahata tha falat: vah hameshaa yuddh main hi ulajhaa rahaa
 He forgot that militarism can only be beneficial in times of crisis
 jab tak france vipattiyon ke badal chhaae rahe vahaan kii janata ne uskaa saath diya vipattiyon ke hatate hi janata ne uskaa saath dena chhod diya
 Losing the sympathy and love of the French public proved fatal to him
 uske atirikt parajeet raashtra uske shatru banate gaye jo avasar milte hi uske khilaaf uth khadey hue
 The historian Kabban has rightly written
 ‘nepolian kaa samrajya yuddh main panpa tha yuddh hi uske astitv kaa aadhaar tha or yuddh main hi uskaa ant hua
 ' doshapurn sainik vyavastha- Initially, the French army was steeped in the spirit of patriotism
 uske samaksh ek adarsh kaa or vah ek uddeshy kii purti ke liye yuddh karata tha
 But as his empire expanded, the national form of the army became legalized
 pehle uski sena main francisi sainik te parantu baad main usamen german italian purtegali or dach sainik shaamil kar liya gaya
 As a result, his army became the army of many states
 unke saamne koi adarsh or uddeshy nahin tha
 Hence, his military power continued to weaken and this proved to be an important reason for his downfall
 nausena kii durbalata- Napoleon had properly organized the army, but he lacked a powerful navy, which caused him to be defeated by England
 agar uske paas shaktishaalee nausena hoti to use england se parajeet nahin hona padataa
 Lack of patriotism in the conquered territories usne jin pradeshon par vijay praapt kii vahin kii janata ke hryday main uske prati sadbhaavna or prem nahin tha
 They hated Napoleon's rule
 jab uski shakti kamjor padane lagi to uske adhinsth rajya apni swatantraaa ke liye praytn karne lage
 The European nation formed a fourth bloc for the League against him and consequently was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo
 pope se shatruta- Due to the continental system, he made the Pope his enemy
 jab pope ne usee mahadwipiya vyavastha ko maanane se inkaar kar diya to usne april 1808 main rome par adhikaar kar liya
 And in 1809 AD, the Pope was imprisoned, leading Catholics to believe that Napoleon was the only demon destroying the freedoms of the states
 varanaa unka dharm nasht karne vaala bhi he
 industrial Revolution- kaha jaataa he ki uski paraaj waterlu ke maidan main na hokar manchester ke kaarkaanon or barkingdhan ke lohe ke bhadiyaan main hui
 As a result of the Industrial Revolution, large-2 factories were opened in England and England became prosperous upon seeing it
 falat: vah apni sena kii aadhunik hatyar se sampann kar sakaa jo nepolian ke liye ghaatak siddh hua
 Continental system mahadwipiya vyavastha uski jabardast bhul thi
 He considered England as his biggest enemy
 england kii shakti kaa mukhya aadhaar nausena or vishwavyaapee vyapaar ta uski nausakti ko nepolian samaapt nahin kar sakaa isliye uske vyapaar par aghat karne kii cheshtaa kii gai
 For this purpose, he gave birth to the continental system, he issued an order that no country can do trade with England
 or na to england kii bani hui vastu kaa istemaal kar saktaa he
 This was Napoleon's terrible mistake
 is vyavastha ne use ek aise jaal main fasaa diya jisase nikalnaa mushkil ho gaya
 Therefore, the continental system is considered to be the main reason for its collapse
 purtegal ke saath yuddh – Purtigal had a commercial relationship with England, but Napoleon's pressure forced him to break ties with England
 isse purtegal ko kaaphi nuksaan hua
 Therefore, he again established a commercial relationship with England
 isapar nepolian ne krodhit hokar purtegal par akraman kar diya
 This too proved fatal for Napoleon
 spain ke saath sangharsh- Napoleon's third mistake was his interference in Spain's internal affairs
 iske lakhon sainik maare gaye
 As a result, his position in this war became absolutely weak
 jisase uske virodhiyon ko protsaahan mila jab nepolian ne apane bhai ko spain kaa raja banaaya to vahaan ke nivasee us videshi ko raja maanane ke liye taiyaar nahin the
 He drove Napoleon's army from Spain
 us vidroh se anya deshon ko bhi protsaahan mila or ve bhi vidroh karne lage jisase uskaa patan avashyambhavi ho gaya
 Russia's campaign nepolian ne rus par akraman kar baari bhul kii rus ne isaki mahadwipiya vyavastha ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Napoleon attacked Russia at this
 isamen yaddhapi masco par iskaa aadhikaar ho gaya lekin use mahaan kshati uthaani padi
 His opponents planned to attack
 ise akraman main use parajeet hona padaa
 Fatigue anek yuddh main lagaataar vyast rahane ke kaaran vah thak chukaa tha 50 sailaaniyon ne likhaa he nepolian ke patan kaa samast kaaran ek hi shabd thakaan main nihit he
 As he got entangled in the war, as his power weakened, he became tired and due to this his downfall became necessary
 sagesambandhi- His immediate relatives were no less responsible for his downfall
 halanki vah apane sambandhiyon ke prati udaartaa kaa bartaav karata tha
 But whenever he was in trouble, his relatives did not help him
 chaturthgut ke sanghathan- Taking advantage of the weakness of Napoleon, his enemies formed the fourth faction and the Allies defeated him
 use pakad kar salbai bheja gaya or use vahaan kaa swatantra shaasha banaaya gaya lekin nepolian vahaan bahut dinon tak nahin rah sakaa vah sheeghra hi france laut gaya or vahaan kaa shaasha ban baitha
 But this time he remained the emperor for only a hundred days
 mitra rashtron ne 18 june 1815 i
 ko waterlu ke yuddh main antim rup se parajeet kar diya
 The captured Allies sent him as a prisoner to an island called St
 Helena where he died in 1821, at the age of 52 years
 is prakaar uparyukt sabhi kaaran pratyaksh evam apratyaksh rup se uske patan ke liye uttaradaayi the usne yuddh ke dwaara hi apane samrajya kaa nirmaan kiya tha or yudhon ke chalate hi uskaa patan bhi hua
 That is, those elements who built Napoleon's empire also destroyed them

 Soon because of Vimal, Abha Bhai Prakash is caught and Abha's true identity is revealed

 Abha and Jagmohan and refused to accept Karan as her husband
 jald hi karan abha uske liye use pyaar kabool karne main safal he
 Karan's childhood friend, Sania Mathur, falls on Swarna Bhavan and falls in love with her
 ek hi samay main, yahan tak ki abha ke bachapan ke dost sanskaar abha ke liye apane pyaar kaa ehsaas he
 Aura gets fixed with the marriage ceremony, but on the wedding day, Karan has an accident and Aura rushes her, revealing her love and marriage to everyone
 Though it hurts her, Aura leaves her parents to care for her love, Karan
 jagmohan unki shaadi nahin kii tarah he or abha detaa he kuch sakht niyam or unhen bhandaaran kamare main sena
 abha kaa pyaar or dekhbhaal jald hi khatm parivaar kaa dil jeetne ke liye

 Sanskar is madly still in love with Aura and wants her, determined to kill Karan, he fails many times
 abha sanskaar junun ke bare main jald hi us par or paata he chintit he
 So Sanskar, Karan divorces Aura and accuses her of doing a work that Sanskar did because of misunderstanding
 He then discovers that it was an urge to aura for rites and forgiveness and remarried
 Sanskar has created a misunderstanding between Aura and Karan, successfully turning Karan against him
 Abha tries to gain the trust of everyone with the help of her sister Lata and her mother
 karan abhimaani or asabhy bahan kanika uske premi tathakthith nikhil or jo baad main jagmohan ko pataa chal gaya ke saath bhaagane kii koshish karata he or vah bahut gusse main he or kanika acchhee tarah se apane parivaar se apamaanit kiya he

 After his refusal, he attempted to kill Karan, but killed his own son, Bunty, by accident
 to vah waapas aata he or pratibha anya bahan yashodhara ke saath badla lene kii koshish karata he
 He is caught and punished but Yashodhara escapes
 vah karan ko maarane ke prayaas karata he
 Abha meets her twin Siddharth, an actor and screenwriter whose real name is Ranchod
 yah pataa chalaa he ki kai saal pehle, jagmohan ek maamle main "777", jisamen unhone baad main pataa chalaa ki vah galat vyakti ke liye lard rahaa tha jeeta
 Because of his case, the innocent person whom he proved wrong lost his son
 ek do saptaah ke baad jab pratibha karan ko janm diya, vah bhi apane judawaan ranchod ko janm diya, lekin jagmohan or ek nani ke sivaay koi nahin he ki pataa tha
 He handed over the innocent Mr
 Tiwari Ranchod and named him
 to baad main karan par ek gambhir car durghatana main ho jaataa he or yaad aa rahi he, abha dukhi or khedpurn chhodane
 ranchod 11 dinon ke liye abha madad karne ke liye, karan ke rup main mukhauta dhaaran kar liya he isliye parivaar main chintit nahin he sahamat hai
 After 11 days, Abha and Ranchod return to Mumbai

 Karan is about the Aura family, when Ranchod tells the sad news, seemingly agreed as Karan enters, about
 abha baahar paata he ki vah he karan bachche ke saath garbhvatee he
 Later Yashodhara and Dushyant are in contact with the evil plan family, although they still survive
 During a religious Holi festival, Rachod explains why that family did not tell the truth and that he is only fulfilling Karan's last wish
 Later it is revealed that Karan is alive and is Dr
 Arundhati, who gives him the house Le and decided to treat her
 anyathaa vah ek sarkari aspataal main bheja jayega or sabase adhik sambhaavna mar jayega
 ke rup main karan baat nahin he or uske sharir sthir kar saktaa he, vah use nil naam
 style samachar patr main karan kii tasviir dekhtaa he or use abha or ranchod se dur rakhane kaa faisla kiya

 However, they find out that this is the wrong man OS and throw him out of the car
