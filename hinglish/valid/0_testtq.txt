 isaki ghatnaayen devil me krai 3: dantej avekaning ke pashchaat va devil me krai 2 or devil me krai 4 ke pehle ghatati hai
 The story of the game revolves around the characters of Dante and Trish on a fictional island of Mallet in modern times, who are searching for him to compete against the devil emperor Mundus

 Devil May Cry has many puzzles

 This concept is similar to capecom's Resident Evil Game
 devil me krai ki shuruyaat hoti he jab dante ke karyaalay main ek rahasyamayi aurat trish usapar hamalaa kar detii he
 Dante impresses her by easily provoking her attack and tells her that he hunts the devils in search of those who have killed her brother and mother
 tab trish use bataati he ki yah hamalaa use parakhane ke liye tha or shaitan samarath mundus, jise dante apane parivaar ki maut kaa zimmedaar maanata he, waapas aane ki tayari kar rahaa he
 The scene then begins with them arriving at a huge fort where Trish suddenly disappears after blowing a high wall
 kile main chanbin karte vakt dante kaa saamana khel main bady maatra main maujud shaitani kathputlion se hota he
 He finds a new "allaster" sword and then encounters the game's first boss Phantom, a giant devil made out of a giant mound and nettle
 yah ladai dante jit jaataa he par phir bhi uskaa saamana baar-baar phentom se kile ke galiyaaron main hota rahata he
 After further investigation Dante encounters a devil named Nilo Anilo who impresses Dante with his courage
 is ladai main shaitan jit jaataa he par dante ke gale main lataka aadha tabeez dekh kar bhaag khada hota he
 Twice further in the game, Satan attacks, and Dante realizes that Satan is his twin brother Virgil
 virgil ki maut ke baad uske gale kaa aadha tabeez dante ke tabeez se jud jaataa he or game ki difolt talwaar "force age", jo dono ke peetaa ki thi, apane asli rup "sparda" main tabdil ho jaati he
 When Dante meets Trish, Trish betrays him and reveals that he works for Mundus, but when his life is in danger, Dante saves him by saying that his face is Dante's mother
 Meets and warns her to stay away from him
 aage chalake jab uskaa saamana mundus se hota he jo trish ki jaan lene vaala hota he, tab dante punah uski jaan bachaa letaa he or mutbhed main zakhami ho jaataa he
 Mundus takes advantage of the opportunity and attacks him, but this time Trish comes in the middle and takes the attack on her
 yah dekh kar dante ki puri taakad ubhar kar saamne aati he or vah sparda main tabdil ho jaataa he
 Dante and Mundus then fight in another reality
 dante jeet jaataa he or jane se pehle apana tabeez or talwaar trish ke sharir ke paas rakh kar saadhaaran rup main laut aata he
 But before Dante leaves Vandip, Mundus comes back and surrounds him
 tabhi trish aa jati he or dante ko apni shakti de detii he
 Dante defeats Mundus who vows to return as he goes
 jab trish dante se maafee maangane ki koshish karti he tab uske aansu nikal aate hai jinhe dekh dante use kahata he ki ab vah shaitan nahin rahi, insaan ban gayi he kyonki "shaitan kabhi nahin rote"
 Dante and Trish escape through the plane on a plane and the ship enters the sea

 He preferred to begin his official history with a king named "meni", who supposedly united the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt
 The transformation into a unified state actually occurred more sequentially than the ancient Egyptian writers would have us believe, and there is no contemporary record of Menes

 The strong institution of governance developed by the pharaohs served to legitimize the state's control over land, labor, and the resources that were necessary for the survival and development of ancient Egyptian civilization

 The pharaohs also provided land to their morgue cults and local temples to ensure that these institutions had the necessary resources to worship the pharaoh after his death
 By the end of the ancient empire, five centuries of these feudal practices gradually eroded the economic power of the pharaohs, now incapable of maintaining a vast centralized administration

 Freed from their loyalty to the pharaoh, local rulers began competing with each other for territorial control and political power
 2160 BC Till, the rulers of Herakleopolis held control of Lower Egypt, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt

 Around 2055 BC, the Theban forces, under the command of Nebhepetre Mantuhotep II, eventually defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers and reintegrated the two territories to begin an economic and cultural renaissance period, known as the Middle Kingdom

 Wazir Amenemhat I, around power, transferred the capital of the country to the city of Iztawi in Fayum
 From Ijtawi, the pharaohs of the 12th dynasty planned land reforms and irrigation with foresight to increase agricultural production in the region
 In addition, the army reclaimed areas of Nubia enriched by mines and gold mines, while laborers built a defensive structure in the East Delta to protect against foreign attack, called "walls-of-the-ruler" " where did it go

 In contrast to the ancient empire's elitist view of the gods, the Middle Kingdom experienced an increase in the sense of personal piety and what might be called the democratization of rebirth, in which all people have a soul and after death in the communion of the gods They can be welcomed

 The last great ruler of the Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III, allowed Asian settlers in the delta region to provide sufficient manpower for their particularly active mining and construction operations
 These ambitious activities of construction and mining, however, combined with the inadequate Nile floods later in his reign, made the economy tense and prompted a second intermediate period with a slow decline during the 13th and 14th dynasties

 The pharaohs of the New Kingdom established a period of unprecedented prosperity by securing their borders and strengthening diplomatic relations with their neighbors
 The military campaigns waged under the command of Thutmose i and his grandson Thutmose III spread the influence of the pharaohs to Syria and Nubia, which strengthened loyalty and gave them access to important imports such as brass and wood
 The pharaohs of the New Kingdom began a massive construction campaign to promote the god Amun, whose growing cult was based in Karnak
 He also constructed monuments in glorification of his achievements, both real and imaginary
 The female pharaoh Hatshepsut used such propaganda to justify her claim to the throne

 Situated in the new capital of Sis, the site kings saw a brief but enthusiastic revival in economy and culture, but by 525 BC
 In, the powerful Persians, led by Cambyses II, began conquering Egypt and eventually succeeded in capturing the pharaoh Samtik III at the Battle of Pelusim
 Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from his home in Susa, leaving Egypt under the control of a centurion

 Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies faced the challenges of native contradiction, incisive family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria formed after the death of Ptolemy IV
 Additionally, as Rome relied more heavily on Egypt for grain imports, the Romans took considerable interest in Egypt's political situation
 Continuing Egyptian revolts, ambitious leaders, and powerful Syrian opponents unbalanced this situation, resulting in Rome being forced to send forces to make this country a province of its empire

 However, the gods were not always seen as benevolent and the Egyptians believed that those gods had to be satisfied by offerings and worship
 padanukram main nae devataaon ko padonnat kiye jane ke kaaran, is devalayas kaa dhaancha lagaataar badalata rahaa, lekin pujaariyon ne vividh or kabhi-kabhi paraspar virdohi utpatti mithkon or kahaniyon ko ek susangat pranali main sangathit karne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 These various conceptions of divinity were not considered antithetical, but rather layers of different aspects of reality
 devataaon kii puja panth mandiron main kii jaati thi, jise raja ke nimitt kaary kar rahe pujaariyon dwaara prashasit kiya jaataa tha
 There was a cult statue at a shrine in the center of the temple
 mandir, saarvajanik puja yaa mandali ke sthaan nahin the or sirf daavat or samaaroh ke chuninda din, devtaa kii murti ke saath punyasthaan ko saarvajanik puja ke liye mandir se baahar laayaa jaataa tha
 Generally, the territory of God was cut off from the outside world and access was only accessible to the temple authorities
 aam naagarik, apane gharon main nijee murtiyon kii puja kar sakate the or arajak shaktiyon ke khilaaf, taabeej suraksha pradaan karte the
 After the New Kingdom, the role of the pharaoh as a spiritual intermediary diminished, as the inclination of religious rites shifted to direct worship of the gods
 parinamswaroop, pujaariyon ne logon tak devataaon kii ichha ke sidhe sampreshan ke liye orekal kii ek pranali viksit kii
 The Egyptians believed that every human being is made up of physical and spiritual parts or aspects
 sharir ke alaava, prayek vyakti main ek šwt, ek ba, ek ka or ek naam hota he
 The heart, not the mind, was considered the place of thoughts and feelings
 mrityu ke baad, aadhyatmik pahalu sharir se mukt ho jate the or apni ichha se gum sakate the, lekin ek sthaayee ghar ke rup main unhen shaareerik avasheshon kii aavashyaktaa hoti thi
 The ultimate goal of a deceased was to reunite with his ka and ba to become a "blessed deceased", who then won as an akh or "an effective"
 aisa ghatit hone ke liye, mritak ko ek mukademe main yogya ghoshit hona chahie, jisamen hriday ko "satya ke pankh" ke khilaaf tola jaataa tha
 If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form
 pracheen misravasiyon ne dafan kii ek vistrut pratha ko banaae rakhaa tha, jo unke vishwaas ke anusaar maut ke baad amartv ko sunishchit karne ke liye aavashyak thi
 These practices included the preservation of the body by mummification, the execution of burial rites, and the entry of the body as well as the objects used by the deceased after death
 Prior to the ancient empire, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally protected by desiccation
 banjar, registani paristhitiyaan, garibon kii antyeshti ke liye pracheen misr ke puure itihaas main ek vardaan bani rahi, jo kuleen varg ko uplabdh vyapak dafan aayojanon ko vahan nahin kar sakate the
 Wealthy Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and, as a result, they used artificial mummification to remove internal organs, wrap the body in flax and place it in a rectangular sarcophagus stone or wooden coffin
 Used to be buried
 kuch angon ko alag se canopic jaar main sangrakshit karnaa chauthe rajvansh main shuru hua
 Until the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; The best technique took 70 days to remove internal organs, remove the brain through the nose, and dry the body in a mixture of salt, called natron
 iske baad sharir ko san ke kapade main lapeta jaataa tha jisaki paraton ke bich suraksha tabeez ko daalaa jaataa tha or phir use ek susajjit maanav rup ke taabut main rakhaa jaataa tha
 Mummies of the late period were also placed in the shell of painted cartonage mummies
 parirakshan kii vaastavik prathaon ko tolemic or roman yug ke dauraan tyaag diya gaya or zyada jor mummy ke bahari swaroop par diya jane laga jise sajaayaa jaataa tha
 Wealthy Egyptians were buried with more items of luxury, but all funerals included goods for the deceased, irrespective of social status
 naveen samrajya shuru hote hue, mritak kii pustakon ko kabr main shaamil kiya gaya, jiske saath shabti pratimaaen hoti thim jo, aisa vishwaas tha ki mrityu-pashchaat mritak ke liye shaareerik shram karti thim
 Rituals in which the deceased was magically resurrected were part of the funeral
 dafnane ke baad, jivit rishtedaar, mritak ke nimitt kabhi-kabhi kabr par bhojan laate the or prarthana karte the
 The ancient Egyptian army was responsible for defending Egypt against foreign invasion and maintaining Egyptian domination in the near-east

 mahatvapurn vyapaar margon kii kilabandi banaae rakhane ke liye sena jimmedaar thi, jaisaa ki nubia ke raste main buhen shahar main paaya gaya
 Forts were also built in the form of military bases, such as the fort of Sylhet, which served as an operating base for the Levant expeditions
 naveen samrajya main, ek shrinkhalaa main kai firoon ne misr kii khadi sena kaa upyog kush or levaant ke kuch hisson par hamalaa karne or vijay hasil karne ke liye kiya
 Typical military equipment included bows and arrows, spears, and a round shield made by stretching animal skin over a wooden frame
 In the New Kingdom, the army began using the chariot, which was formerly started by the Hyksos invaders
 pital ko apnaane ke baad shastr or kavach main sudhaar hota rahaa: dhaal ko ab thos lakdi se banaaya jane laga, jisamen kaanse kaa bakal laga hota tha, tir kii nok par kansaa lagaaya jaataa tha or asian sainikon se khopesh apanaaya gaya
 The pharaoh was generally depicted riding in front of the military in art and literature, and there is evidence to prove that at least some pharaohs, such as Sequenener Tao II and his sons, did so
 sainikon ko aam janata se bhartee kiya jaataa tha, par naveen samrajya ke dauraan or khaskar baad main, nubia, kush or libya se bhaade ke ladaakuon ko misr ke liye ladane ke liye liya gaya
 In technology, medicine and mathematics, ancient Egypt attained a relatively high level of productivity and sophistication
 paaramparik anubhavvaad, jaisaa ki edwin smith or abers papiri dwaara pramanit hua, uskaa pehla shrey misr ko jaataa he or vaigyanik paddati kii jaden bhi pracheen misr se prasaarit hui

 Even before the ancient empire, the ancient Egyptians developed a glass-like substance called fences, which they believed to be a type of artificial semi-precious stone
 fence, silica, chuunaa or soda kii alp maatra or ek ranjak, aamtaur par tamba se bana ek gaiyr mitti kaa ceramic he
 This material was used to make beads, tiles, sculptures and small materials
 fence nirmaan karne ke liye kai tareekon kaa prayog kiya ja saktaa he, lekin aam taur par nirmaan prakriya main ek paste ke rup main powder saamagree ko ek mitti ke kor par prayog kiya jaataa he, jise phir aag main jalaayaa jaataa he
 By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment called Egyptian Blue, also known as Blue Frit, which was produced by mixing alkalis such as silica, copper, lime, and natron
 utpaada ko pisa ja saktaa he or ek varnak ke rup main istemaal kiya ja saktaa he
 The ancient Egyptians could with great skill shield various objects from glass, but it is not clear that they developed this process independently
 yah bhi spasht nahin he ki unhone apane khud ke kachche shishe ko nirmit kiya yaa keval purv-nirmit silliyon kaa aayaat kiya, jise unhone baad main pighalaaya or swaroop diya
 tathaapi, vasteen banane main unhen nishchit rup se takneekee visheshgyata hasil thi, saath hi saath, taiyaar glass ke rang ko niyantrit karne ke liye sanket tatwon ko jodne main bhi kushal the
 Diverse colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque

 Ancient Egyptian surgeons sewed wounds, fractured bones, and cut the diseased limb, but admitted that some injuries were so severe that they could only comfort the patient until he died
 aarambhik misravasiyon ko kareeb 3000 isa purv ke aas-paas yah jaankaree thi ki kaise lakdi ke pataron ko ek jahaaj peta banane ke liye ikatthe joda jaataa he
 The American Archaeological Institute reported that the oldest ships ever discovered, a group of 14 ships discovered in Abidos, were built by stitching together wooden rails
 neuyork vishvavidhyalay ke egyptologist david o'conor dwaara kii gai is khoj main paaya gaya ki gunthe gaye feeton ko pataron ko ek saath jode rakhane ke liye istemaal kiya gaya, or pataron ke bich bharaa paaya gaya narkat yaa ghaas jodon ko sil karne main madad karata tha
 Since all the ships are buried together and near the morgue of the Khasekhemi pharaoh, it is believed that they all originally belonged to him, but one of the 14 ships dated to 3000 BC
 Is of, and the associated clay jars buried with the ship also suggest an earlier date
 3000 isa purv kii avadhi vaala jahaaj 75 feet lambaa he or ab yah mana jaataa he ki yah shaayad kisi pehle ke firo se sambandhit he
 According to Professor o'connor, this 5000 year old ship may have belonged to the Aha pharaoh
 aarambhik misravasi yah bhi jaanate the ki kaise lakdi ke gujjhon ke upyog se pataron ko ek saath baandha ja saktaa he or alakatre ke prayog se sandhiyon ko sandaband kiya ja saktaa he
 "khufu Ship", a 43
6-meter vessel called 2500 BC
 Around the Fourth Dynasty in the Giza Pyramid complex was buried in a pit under the Great Pyramid of Giza, a full-size living example that may have completed the symbolic work of the Solar Bark
 Early Egyptians also knew how to tie the sails of this ship together with mortise and groove joints
 Despite the ancient Egyptian ability to build huge boats to sail on the easily navigable Nile River, they are not known as good sailors and did not engage in extensive sailing or shipping in the Mediterranean or the Red Sea 
 ganitiya gananaa kaa sabase aarambhik anupramanit udhaaharan, purv-rajvansheey nakada avadhi main miltaa he or ek puri tarah se viksit ank pranali ko darshata he
 The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is reflected by a fictional letter from the New Kingdom in which the author proposes a contest between himself and another writer concerning daily computation tasks, such as labor, grain, and land
 rind mathematical pepirus or moscow mathematical pepirus yah darshaate hai ki pracheen misravasi, chaar buniyadi ganitiya sankriyaaon ko kar sakate the - jod, ghataav, guna or vibhaajan - apurnank kaa upyog, bakse or pyramid ke pariman kii gananaa or aayaton, trikon, vrutt or yahan tak ki chakra ke tal-kshetrafal kii gananaa bhi kar sakate the
 He understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations
 ganitiya sanketan dashamalav tha or das lakh tak das ke prayek ghaat ke pratikatmak sanket par aadhaarit tha
 Each of these could be written as many times as needed to add up to the desired number; That is, to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the sign of ten or hundred was written eight times respectively
 chunki unki gananaa ke tareeke se ek se adhik ganak ke adhikansh apurnank ko sambhala nahin ja saktaa tha, pracheen misr ke apurnank ko kai apurnank ke jod ke rup main likhaa jaataa tha
 For example, the decimal number two over five was solved by adding one over three + one over fifteen; This was made easier by the standard list of values
 kuch aam apurnank, tathaapi, ek vishesh gliff ke saath likhe jate the; aaj ke aadhunik do tihaai ko dahini taraf dikhaaya jaataa tha
 Ancient Egyptian mathematicians had an understanding of the fundamentals of the Pythagoras theorem, for example, a triangle has a right angle opposite the hypotenuse when its sides are in a 3–4–5 ratio
 ve ek vrutt ke kshetra fal kaa anumaan, uske vyas se nauven hisse ko ghataakar or parinaam ko duguna kar ke laga lete the

 Ancient Egyptian culture and monuments have left a lasting legacy on the world
 udhaaharan ke liye, devi isis kaa panth roman samrajya main lokapriy hua, jabaki obelisk or anya avasheshon ko, rome main waapas le jaaya gaya
 The Romans also imported building materials from Egypt to erect structures in the Egyptian style
 Early historians such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Deodorus Sickleus studied this country, which came to be seen as a place of mystery
 During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period, Egyptian pagan culture began to decline after the rise of Christianity and later Islam, but in the writings of medieval scholars, such as dhul-nun al-misri and al-makrizi of Egyptian antiquity
 The interest remained

 After this, Tulsidasji came to Kashi with the permission of God
 vahaan unhone bhagavan vishwanath or mata annapurna ko shriramcharitamanas sunaaya
 The book was kept in the temple of Shri Vishwanathji at night
 sabere jab pat kholaa gaya to usapar likhaa hua paaya gaya- 'satyam shivan sundaram' or neeche bhagavan shankar kii sahi thi
 At that time, people present also heard the voice of 'satyam Shivam Sundaram' with their ears

 Those groups tied up and started condemning Tulsidasji and tried to destroy that book

 Other copies began to be made on the basis of the same

 After the defeat of Napoleon, the work of restructuring began in Europe

 Louis 18 made a constitutional declaration as soon as he sat on the throne

 In France, there was a system of legislative royalism, responsible cabinet and bicameral legislature

 He was a strong supporter of the greatness of the Church
 janata is naye raja se jitani ghrinaa karti thi, kuleen log utana hi uskaa aadar karte the

 1815 se 1830 ke bich visheshadhikaar varg kii cheshtha se is varg ke hit par khatra utpann ho gaya tha
 Therefore, the middle class again became active to protect its rights

 Impacts all over Europe and the Metternich system was hurt

 shri ve aar taneja ke shabdon main- a national college was established in Calcutta to provide educational facilities to the students engaged in the national movement
 shri aravind ko 150 ru prati maah ke vetan par is college kaa pradhanacharya niyukt kiya gaya
 Taking advantage of this opportunity, Mr
 Arvind developed the concept of 'national Education' and laid the foundation of his philosophy of education
 yahi college aage chalakar jadavapur vishvavidhyalay ke rup main viksit hua
 While working as Principal, Shri Arvind continued to participate in political activities by inspiring the countrymen with his writings and speeches

 aravind kii drushti main yoga kaa arth jivan ko tyaagna nahin he balki daivi shakti par vishwaas rakhte hue jivan kii samasyaon evam chunautiyon kaa saahas se saamana karnaa he
 In the view of Arvind, yoga is not even to practice hard asanas and pranayama, but to surrender selflessly to God and to transform oneself into divine form through mental education
 aravind ne mastishk kii dharna spasht karte hue kaha he ki mastishk ke vichaar-str chitt, manas, buddhi tathaa arntagyaan hote hai jinka kramash: vikaas hota he

 Arvind's perception of the brain is the culmination of 'atmanas' and its existence
 atimanas chetana kaa ucch str he tathaa daivi aatm shakti kaa rup he
 The goal of education should be to reach the state of superhuman
 aravind ke anusaar bhartiya pratibha kii teen visheshtaayen hai- atmagyaan, sarjanaatmakataa tathaa budhimatta 
 Arvind wanted to make an Indian renaissance by giving the message of developing these ancient spiritual powers among the countrymen

 Education should be the supreme development of the inherent intellectual and moral abilities of the individual
 arvind kaa vishwaas tha ki maanav daivi shakti se samanvit he or shiksha kaa lakshya is chetana shakti kaa vikaas karnaa he
 That is why they considered the brain as the 'sixth sense'
 shiksha kaa prayojan in chha: gyanendriyon kaa sadupyog karnaa sikhaanaa hona chahie

 Through science, human understands the natural environment and comes discipline for the development of objective intelligence
 mastishk ko pradhanta dene ke kaaran aravind paathyakram main manovigyaan vishay ko bhi sammilit karnaa chaahate the jisase ki `samgr jivan-drushti' viksit ho sake
 For this purpose, he also gave philosophy and logic in the curriculum
 aravind balak ke bauddhik vikaas ke saath uskaa naitik evam dharmik vikaas bhi karnaa chaahate the
 His belief was- "human mental instinct is based on moral instincts
 bauddhik shiksha, jo naitik va bhaavnaatmak pragati se rahit ho, maanav ke liye hanikaarak he
 "for moral education, Arvind was in favor of Guru's ancient Indian tradition in which the Guru could be a friend of the disciple, a pioneer and a guide
 anushaasan dwaara hi vidhyaarthiyon main acchhee aadaton kaa nirmaan ho saktaa he
 Moral should be given through "communication method" in which the Guru motivates students for moral development by example of personal ideal life and ancient great men
 aravind ke anusaar shikshan ek vigyaan he jiske dwaara vidhyaarthiyon ke vyavhaar main parivartan aana anivaary he

 "every student should be educated according to personal aptitude and ability
 vidhyaarthee ko apni pravriti arthath "swadharm" ke anusaar vikaas ke avasar milane chahie
 Arvind considered 'manas', ie the sixth sense brain, whose emphasis was on development
 viksit maanas se 'sookshm drushti' utpann hoti he jisase nishpaksh drushtikon viksit hota he
 The goal of teaching ‘chitta Shuddhi’ through yoga should be
 aravind kii drushti main vahi shikshak prabhavi shikshan kar saktaa he jo uparokt vidhi se vidhyaarthee kaa vikaas kare
 Help educated students to develop their supervision, attention, judgment and memory through proper use of knowledge and brain
 shikshan baalkon kii tark shakti ke vikaas dwaara unamem antardrushti utpann kare
 Arvind used to show the importance of teacher and said that- argon ek rasinic tatv he
