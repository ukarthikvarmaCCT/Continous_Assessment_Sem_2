 On August 26, after remaining silent for 11 days, Rahul Gandhi, who is considered the future helper of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, said - "it is a dangerous practice to reduce the dignity of democracy
" vyaktigat rup se kai logon ne desh ko mahatvapurn yogadan diya he lekin ye samajhnaa zaruri he ki loktantric prakriya kaa apana mahatv he, loktantricprakriya lambii zarur hoti he par isse sabhi ko apana vichaar rakhane kaa mauka miltaa he
 

 In the past, it is being understood that the coming out of an ombudsman law will get rid of corruption, but it is wrong, just by enacting an ombudsman law will not end corruption, but it will have to find solutions to many more challenges
 Kiran Bedi wrote on Twitter that, "it may not be enough for an ombudsman to get started
" "rahul gandhi ke bayaan se acroshit anna hajaare ke samarthakon ne shuukravaar ko unke tughlaq road sthit awaas ke baahar pradarshnakia or jamkar narebaaji kii
 Police took 50 of Anna's supporters into custody
 rahul gandhi ne apane ghar ke baahar pradarshan kar rahe anna samarthakon ke liye cold drinks or samose bhijwaaye
 On 27 August, the government debated Anna's three main demands in Parliament
 
 By 8 o'clock in the night, both the houses of Parliament passed a resolution to send it to the Standing Committee to consider these conditions by voice
 sansad ke donon sadanon main shanivaar ko lokapal mudde par anna hajaare kii maangon ke anuroop laae gaye prastaav par saidhantik rup se sahmati banane ke baad pradhanmantri manmohan singh kaa patr lekar kendriya vigyaan evam praudyogiki mantri vilasarav deshmukh, saansad sandip dikshit or purv kendriya mantri vilaas mutemvaar ne anna ko ramlila maidan pahunchakar diya
 After this, Anna Hazare addressed the supporters and said, "jan Lokpal has won this half
 puri jeet abhi baaki he
 This is the victory of the entire youth power
 yah janataki jeet he
 This is the victory of social organization
 yah media kii jeet he
 "I want to end my fast in the presence of you all at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, that too with your permission
 aap jashn jarur manaaen lekin dhyaan rakhen ki isse shanti bhang na ho or kisi ko pareshaani na ho
 Anna ended the fast on 28 August by drinking honey-mixed coconut water at the hands of Simran, a five-year-old girl from the Dalit community of Sundernagri, and Iqra, a Muslim from Turkman Gate
 anna ke anshan sthagit karne se pehle unke pramukh sahyogi arvind kejariwal ne apane lambey vaktavy main manch se logon ko sambodhit karte hue kaha ki wo sabhi raajnneetik dalon kaa dhanyavad karte hai or saath hi logon kaa bhi jinke sadakon par aane ke kaaran sarkaar par dabaav bana
 This proposal would not have passed without the cooperation of the parties
 We thank them
 


samvidhan logon ne banaaya he or sabase upar log hai jiske baad samvidhan, sansad or saansad aate hai
 The laws in Parliament were made according to the wishes of the people
 anna yaa anna kaa andolan samvidhan ke kilaaf nahin he jaisaa ki team ke bare main prachaarit kiya ja rahaa he
 After breaking the fast, Anna thanked the people of the country, especially the youth, media, police and doctors for their care in making the movement successful and said that "they have just postponed their fast but their fight will continue 
 asli anshan puri ladaai jeetne ke baad tuutegaa
 i will roam across the country till the fight is over
 unhen vishwaas he ki unke madhyam se saamne laae gaye janata ke muddon se sansad inkaaranheen karegi
 But if the parliament refused, then the mass parliament would have to be ready
 aaj yah baat sabit ho gai he ki jan sansad, dilli kii sansad se badi he
 Whatever the Parliament wants, the Parliament of Delhi has to accept it

 Today such a big movement took place in the country, but completely non-violent

 This has been the most important thing in this movement

 After this, Union Law Minister Salman Khurshid and Anna's aide Arvind Kejriwal and Akhil Gogoi met at the residence of Congress MP Sandeep Dixit
 iske baad arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar vaarta ke liye taiyaar ho gai he

 The government has sought time till Wednesday morning to consider them
 prashanth bhushan ne kaha ki sarkaar ne anna se anshan todane kii bhi apil kii he
 But in the conversation that took place today, nothing came out that we should ask Annaji to break the fast
 vaarta main sarkaar kuch muddon par sahamat ho gai thi
 But many subjects had not yet been agreed
 iske saath hi anna ke sahyogi kuch sharton par sarkaar kii manjuuri bhi chaahate the
 Keeping in mind the re-talks with Anna's colleagues in the morning, late night the Prime Minister called an emergency meeting on the Anna issue and discussed it with senior ministers
 iske turant baad congress kor group kii baithak bhi hui
 But the result of all these exercises came to the contrary on 24 August
 sarkaar kaa rukh bilkul badal gaya tha
 After a conversation with Pranab Mukherjee, Prashant Bhushan said that the government's stand was very positive in the talks held on Tuesday, but on Wednesday everything looked like a revenge
 arvind kejariwal ne kaha ki sarkaar ne saafe kar diya he ki wo jan lokapal bill ko pesh nahin karegi
 Kiran Bedi said that Pranab Mukherjee appeared in a rage as soon as the meeting started on Wednesday and he was saying that you should keep doing it
 anna ke anshan ke bare main sarkaar ne kaha ki wo unki yani naagarik samaaj or anna hazaare kii samasya he
 i don't know why it changed in the government's attitude in one day and night

 Yesterday, he was respecting our words

 " is gatirodh ke pashchaat 25 agast ko pradhanmantri ne vilasarav deshmukh ko patr dekar anna ke paas bheja
 Anna assured to quit the fast after three things were approved
 27 agast ko sansad kii kaaryava ke saath hi anna ke sahyogiyon se bhi lagaataar barta chal rahi thi
 But the government was not making its stand clear
 antat shaam tak in vaartaon kaa parinaam anna kii teen maangon par sansad ke samarthan ke prastaav ke rup main aayaa
 Vilas Rao Deshmukh again came to Ramlila Maidan with a letter from the Prime Minister to inform about it

 Anna's weight had decreased by seven and a half kilos due to the 13-day fast
 unka rakt chaap kaaphi kam ho gaya tha
 Doctor Trehan, who has been continuously checking Anna's health for 13 days, said that Anna's body is deficient in water and he has become very weak
 unke swasthya par nazar rakhane ke liye unhen kuch dinon ke liye gudgaanv ke ek aspataal main bhartee kar liya gaya
 The whole country was engulfed in celebration with the announcement of Anna's demands in Parliament on 27 August and Anna's announcement of ending the fast on 28 August
 rajdhani dilli, mumbai, kolkata, patna, ranchi, lakhanu, bengaluru, shimla, jaipur, raipur, gandhinagar sahit puure desh main diwaali jaisaa maahaul ban gaya

 Yes, it definitely made way for him
 anna ke teen sharton ke samarthan kaa prastaav sansad ne sthai samiti ko bhej diya tha jise maananaa uske liye kanoonee rup se baadhya nahin tha
 Further, the Standing Committee was empowered to analyze all these suggestions and also decide how practical they were
 sansad ne sarkaar ke us mul tark ko saidhantik rup se kaayam rakhaa tha ki kaanoon banane main sansad kii bhoomika sarvopari he or us par sawaal nahin uthaae ja sakate
 After a day-long debate in Parliament, DMK, Bahujan Samaj Party, Marxist Communist Party, Communist Party of India, Samajwadi Party and Biju Janata Dal had made it clear that Parliament should not play a role in the appointment of Lokayukta as it would give autonomy to the states
 Will be affected inamen se kuch dalon ne aise kisi qadam ke virodh karne kii manshaa bhi saafe kar di thi
 The Congress accepted to bring the lower bureaucracy under the Lokpal, but also said that a fundamental change in the legal and institutional structure is yet to be done
 saansadon ne jan lokapal bill kii sansad ke andar saansad ke vyavhaar ko lokapal ke kaary kshetra main laane kii dhara kaa dalgat bhaavana se upar uthakar ek swar main virodh kiya tha
 Many parties also opposed bringing the judiciary under its purview
 kuch dalon ne iske badale rashtriya nyaayik ayog banaae jane kii vakaalat kii or kuch ne majboot javabdehi vidheyak laane par jor diya tha
 The government did not give any promise on the issue of including the Prime Minister
 bhaajapa samet kai dalon ne kuch aihtiyaat ke saath pradhanmantri ko bhi isamen shaamil kiye jane kaa jarur samarthan kiya
 The final decision on how to bring two more important demands, the cbi's anti-corruption unit under the Lokpal and the dismissal of corrupt bureaucrats, was also left to the standing committee
 is janandolan ne raajnneetik dalon ke chehron par pade lokahitaishi nakaab ko hataakar swaarthee sattakankshi or janvirohi charitra ko spasht kar diya
 Along with the opposition parties, the most perverted face of it was the Indian National Congress, the ruling party at the center

 On 14 August, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari personally attacked Anna Hazare and said that Anna is corrupt
 iske liye unhone congress sarkaar dwaara gathit nyaayamurti saavant kii rapat kaa sandarbh diya tha, jisamen anna ko doshi tehraaya gaya tha
 He did not say that after the report of Justice Sawant, Sukhtankar Commission had investigated the issue and discharged Anna

 Manmohan Singh warned foreign powers to be behind this movement in Parliament
 ambika soni ne ise saaf karte hue america kaa naam ujagar kiya
 All the leaders repeatedly called for the supremacy of the Parliament and tried to make the efforts of the people chaotic

 The benevolent and gregarious people of the government and those sitting in the government, left no stone unturned to suppress and break this movement, directly and indirectly
 gayi
 The personality and gratitude of Anna Hazare, the leader of the movement for taking the form of the national movement of the campaign against corruption, included the right and timely decisions of a skilled team
 arvind kejariwal, kiran vedi, prashanth bhushan aadi samarth logon kii team ne is andolan ko nirantar sahi raste par rakhaa or uske pathbhrasht hone kii gunjaaish samaapt kar di

 a special part of the heart, called a sinotrial node, is responsible for the atrial transmission capacity
 sinotroial node koshikaon kaa ek samooh dahini aatrium kii diwaar par, superior vena kawa ke pravesh dwaar ke paas tainaat he
 These cells are modified cardiomyocytes
 inke paas alpaviksit sankuchansheel tantu hote hai, lekin inke anubandh apekshaakrit rup se kamjor hote hai

 The greatest importance of this book is that it gets the first form of Kannada prose
 uparyukt do granthon ke atirikt ab tak is kaal kaa anya koi granth uplabdh nahin hua he
 The period of the pump is particularly important in the history of Kannada literature, which is also known as the "golden Age"
 is kaal kaa doosraa naam he "jain yug", kyonki is avadhi main kannada sahitya kii shrivriddhi karanevaalon main jain mataavlambee kaviyon kaa vishesh haath rahaa
 Each of these Jain poets primarily composed two types of poetry - a Jain religious poem or an object of religious poetry was the story of a Tirthankara or great man, and cosmic poetry depicts the stories of mythological poems
 is prakaar do-do granth rachane kaa uddeshy ek or jain dharm ke tatwon kaa prachaar karnaa tha or duusari ore sanskrit ke lokapriy mahakavyon kaa kannada main praturup prastut karke logon ko apane dharm kii ore aakarshith karnaa tha
 These Jain poets were scholars of Sanskrit, Prakrit and Apabhramsa languages, were penetrating literature and were also talented poets
 in kaviyon ne aavashyak parivartan ke saath puranic kathankon ko apane dharm ke anukool avashya banaaya, kintu unki moulikta ko nasht na hone dekar rochakata ko banaae rakhaa
 The Kannada language and literature were greatly favored by the writings of Jain poets
 is avadhi main champu kavyastylee kaa vishesh prachaar hua
 In the religious poems of this time, the heroic and the rasad rasas were particularly expressive in the wonderful and quiet and temporal poems
 uparyukt do prakaar ke kaavyon ke atirikt chand, ras, alankaar, vyakaran, kosh, jyotish, vaidyak aadi vibhinn vishyon par bhi granth likhe gaye
 In this era, Kannada literature progressed as a whole
 is yug ke prasiddh kavi teen the–pump, ponn tathaa rann jo "rannatrayee" ke naam se prasiddh hai
 The Mahakavi pump or Adi pump composed two poems - "adipuran" and "vikramarajunvijay" or "pump India"
 adipurana main jinsenacharyakrit sanskrit purvapurana ke aadhaar par pratham tirthakar vrishabhnath kaa jeevancharit chitrit kiya gaya he or "vikramarjunvijay" main mahabharat ke kathanak kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Both of these are Champukavya
 pump kannada ke adikavi maane jate hai
 Their time is believed to be around 941 CE
 ponn pump ke samakaleen the
 He composed three texts - "shantipuran", "jinaksharamala" and "bhuvanaikaramabhyudaya"
 antim granth uplabdh nahin he
 Ranna's main compositions are two - "ajitpuran" and "sahas Bhimavijay" or "gadayudha"
 gadayuddh ke nayak bhim hai
 There is a unique euphemism of Veeras in Gadayudh
 isi kavy se rann kii rkiti achal hui he
 Other poets of the pump era include the names of Choundarai, Nagavarma, Durgasingh, Chandraraj, Nagachandra, Nagavarma etc
 choundary kaa "choundrayuparan" pracheen kannada gadhy kaa sundar namoona he
 Two texts of Nagavarma i have been received - "karnataka Kandabari" and "chhandombudhi"
 "karnatakakadambari" baan kii kadambari kaa kannada praturup he
 It is in the Champo style
 pro mughali kaa mat he ki kannada main anudit jitne granth hai unamem nagvarm kii karnatakakadambari sarvshereshth he–chandraraj or shridharacharya nagvarm ke samakaleen kavi hai
 Chandraraja's treatise on Madrasatilak and Madhutilak's astrological treatise called "jatakatilak" are both masterpieces
 isi kaal main durgasingh ne, jo bhagwat sampradaay ke kavi the, sanskrit "panchatantr" kaa anuwaad prastut kiya
 Between the 11th and 12th centuries another famous poet was named Nagachandra
 kyonki inhone panpabharat se prerana paakar ramayana kii rachana kii, isliye inkaa doosraa naam "abhinav pump" padaa
 Nagchandra also composed two poems like the earlier Jain poets - "mallinathpuran" and "ramachandrachitrapuran" or "pamparamayan"
 panparamayana hi kannada ke uplabdh ramakatha sambandhi kaavyon main sabase pracheen he
 The Mahakavis emerged in Pampyuga and enriched Kannada with their great works
 yadhyapi is kaal main bade-bade kalatmak praudh kaavyon kaa nirmaan hua, to bhi samaaj ke saadhaaran logon ke jivan ke saath sahitya kaa sampark nahin tha
 The main reason for this was that the poets of this time lived in the shelter of the kings and whatever they used to write, either to sing the fame of their shelter kings or to get the applause among other pundits of the court or their religion
 To promote
 iskaa parinaam yah hua ki bolchaal kii bhashaa sahitya sarjan ke liye upyukt nahin samajhi gai
 Sanskrit was influenced everywhere
 champu style main jo praudh kavy rache gaye ve saadhaaran janata kii vastu na hokar panditon tak simit rahe
 The period from late 12th century to 15th century is called Basava era
 is yug kaa doosraa naam "krantiyug" he
 At this time, there was no such area in Karnataka, religious, social or political, which could remain untouched by the revolution
 is kranti ke unnayak basav, basavann athwa basaweshwar the, iliye is yug kaa naam basav yug padaa
 In this period, the above-mentioned Kannada literature was devised in place of Sanskritist Kannada and native verses were given special encouragement in lieu of Sanskrit poetry
 pichhali shatabdiyon main jain mataavalambiyon kaa sahityakshetra main sarvadhikaar tha
 In this era, different opinions contributed to the creation of literature
 sahitya kii shrivriddhi main bhakthi ek prabal prerak shakti ke rup main sahaayak hui
 Basaveshwara emerged in the second half of the 12th century
 unhone virshaiv mat kaa pun: sanghatan karke karnataka ke dharmik evam saamaajik jivan main badi uthal puthal machaai
 Basava and his followers used colloquial Kannada as a medium for propagating their views
 virshaiv bhakton ne bhakthi, gyaan, vairaygy, sadachaar evam niti par niraadambar style main apane anubhavon kii baaten sunai, jo vachan sahitya ke naam se prasiddh hui
 The words of these Veerashaiva devotees or Shiva Sharan are a type of prose
 shivasharanon ne sahitya ke liye sahitya nahin rachaa
 His main objective was to propagate his ideas
 unke vichaaron main saralata thi, sachaai thi or sachche jigyaasu kii rasmagnata tha
 Therefore, literary eloquence in his speech came automatically
 in shivasharanon ke vachanon ne karnataka main vahi kaary kiya jo kabir tathaa unke anuyaayiyon ne uttar bharat main kiya
 Basava preached devotion and in the practice of this devotion, Vedic rituals, idolatry, discrimination of caste lines, avatarism, blind faith etc
 were hindered
 jatirahit, varnarahit, vargrahit samaaj ke nirmaan dwaara unhone aadhyatmik saadhan kaa maarg sarvasulabh bananaa chaha
 Among the contemporary Veerashaiva devotees of Basava are Allamprabhu, Akkamahadevi, chennai-bansava and Siddharam
 in vachanakaar shivasharanon ke atirikt virshaiv mataavlambee bahut se aise kavi hue jinhone bhakthibhavpradhan naanaa prakaar ke kavyagranth deshi chhandon kaa prayog karte hue prastut kiye
 The three best poets between the 12th and 13th centuries were Harihara, Raghavanka and Padmasaras
 is kaal ke jain kaviyon main nemichandra, bandhuvarma, jann, mallikarjun, keshiraj, rattakavi or kumudendu muni ke naam ullekhneey hai
 In the 13th century, the religious situation of Karnataka was again in turmoil
 ek ore karnataka ramanujacharya dwaara sthapit shrivaishnav sampradaay se prabhavit hua or duusari ore usamen madhwacharya ke dwait mat kii bhakthi kii nai lahar chali
 The Bhaktidhara run by these two Vaishnava sects brought new power to Kannada literature
 parinamswaroop puranic mahakavyon ke kathankon kaa kannada main nae sire se vishuddh mul rup main nirupan hua
 During this period, there was a Vaishnava poet named Rudrabhatta whose "jagannathvijay" is considered to be the first Vaishnav manag poetry of Kannada
 yah champu style main likhaa gaya he or isaki kathavstu krishna se sambandhit he
 The period from the 15th century to the end of the 19th century is called the Kumaravayas era
 is avadhi main vijaynagar ke samraaton tathaa mysore ke raajaaon ne kannada sahitya kii shrivriddhi main vishesh haath bantaya
 The reputation of Vaishnavism grew, whose response was also reflected in Kannada literature
 vaishnav dharm dwaara prachaarit bhakthi sahityasarjan main prerak shakti ke rup main prakat hui
 Literature came in very close contact with the public
 is kaal ke sarvshereshth kavi narnapp hai jo apni lokapriyata ke kaaran "kumarvyas" ke abhidhaan se prakhyat hue
 Kumaravas was the principal poet of the Bhagavata sect
 narnapp athwa kumarvyas kii janmatithi, janmasthan tathaa unke rachanakaal ke sambandh main vidwaanon main matbhed hai
 According to Prof
 Mughali, Kumaravas were alive between the 14th and 15th centuries
 kumarvyas ne "kannada bharat" athwa "gadugin bharat" or "airavat" naamak do kavy likhe the, aisa mana jaataa he
 But doubts have been expressed about Airavat being his masterpiece
 "kannada bharat" main vyasarchit mahabharat ke pratham das parvo kii katha kaa nirupan kiya gaya he
 Although Pampa had presented a Kannada model of the whole story of the Mahabharata through his "pampaharata", it could not become as popular as the Kannada Bharata of Kumaravayas
 iske do kaaran hai– ek yah he ki panpabharat main paandityapradarshan kii pravriti adhik thi or doosraa yah ki usamen jain dharm kaa rang bhi chadha tha
 After the kannada-bharata of Kumaravayas, many of the best poems were presented in the Shaktadi style based on the stories of Mahabharata, Ramayana and Bhagavata
 kumarvyas ke dikhalaae hue maarg par chalakar narhari athwa kumaravalmiki naamak kavi ne valmiki ramayana ke aadhaar par kannada main "torveramayana" kii rachana kii
 It is also a devotional treatise poem, which is a succulent artwork of ancient Kannada
 bhagwat mataavlambee kaviyon main timmann kavi, chatu vitthalanath, lakshmish tathaa nagaras ke naam ullekhneey hai
 Inspired by the Kumaravyas, the Timman poet described the story of the last eight festivals of the Mahabharata in his poem titled "krishnaraja Bharat"
 sabase pehle samgr bhagwat kaa kannada padyanuwaad chatu vitathalanath naamak bhagwat kavi ne prastut kiya
 Around this period, there was a very talented poet whose name was Lakshmish
 inkaa likhaa hua "jaiminibharat" anupam kavy he jisamen mahabharat ke katipay rochak prasangon kaa sundar evam marmasparshi varnan kiya gaya he
 Jaminibharat is the place in Karnataka after Kumaravyas India in terms of popularity
 nagaras naamak kavi ne bhagavadgita kaa "vasudevakthamritasar" naamak kannada padyanuwaad prastut kiya
 Just as the poets of the Bhagavata sect like Kumaravayas, Kumaravalmiki, Lakshmish practiced devotional management poems in Kannada by taking narratives from epics like Bharat, Ramayana, Bhagavata, similarly Madhavamatavali devotees colloquially composed songs, hymns, kirtans in Kannada The message of devotion was brought home to Karnataka
 in bhakton kii parampara kaa aarambh 13veen shatabdi main narharitirth dwaara hua tha
 At this time a large congregation of these devotees had gathered, which was mainly divided into two parts
 ek dal kaa naam tha "vyasakut" or duusare kaa "daskut"
 The difference between these two was that they were called Bhakt Vyasakutas who were mostly Brahmins and who considered Sanskrit suitable only for the expression of their thoughts, and they were considered as Bhakta Daskut which included people of all castes and those who were Kannada
 Through bhajans, kirtans were composed
 sampradaay kii tatv sambandhi baton main "vyasakut" tathaa "daskut" ke bhakton main koi antar nahin tha
 Devotees of both these parties are famous in Karnataka as Haridas

 "hadivadeydharm" honnamma kaa ek sundar kavy he jisamen satidharm kaa pranjal bhashaa main varnan kiya gaya he
 The essence of Sankara's Advaita doctrine is presented in Saras Kannada in the "anubhavamrita" written by the Mahalingrang poet
 chikadevaraay swayan achche kavi the
 In this era, Veerashaiva Mtavlabi devotees and poets also served Kannada by creating various types of texts
 inamen kuch shatak style main likhe gaye hai
 Apart from the verse style, some prose texts were also written and verses like sangatya, tripadi, circle, champoo, song etc
 were specially used
 kintu is lambii avadhi main jitne vachanakaar hue ve ine gine hi hai
 Among the Veerashaiva poets who presented the Charitakavya were Chamaras, Virupaksha Pandits and Conspiracy Deities
 chamras ke likhe kaavyon main "prabhulingalile" shreshth charitkavy he
 Alluvum Prabhu's biography is expanded in "prabhulingalele"
 virshaiv kaviyon main shreshth prabandh kavy rachnewaalon main harihar ke baad chamras kaa naam aadar ke saath liya jaataa he

 harihar ke "basavarajragale" tathaa chamras ke "prabhulingalile" jaise charitakaavyon main matdharm tathaa kavyadharm kaa jaisaa sundar samanvay hua he, vaisaa "chennabasavpurana" main nahin ho paaya he
 In the Pampa era, Jain poets made champu style very popular in Kannada through their best management poems
 lekin aage chalakar is style kaa upyog kam hota gaya
 This style was adopted again in the Kumaravayas era
 ise apnaanevaale kavi jain nahin apitu virshaiv the

 As the name may imply, environmental management does not refer to the management of the environment, but to the modern human society's interaction with the environment and the management of its effects
 prabandhakon ko prabhavit karne vaale teen pramukh mudde hai raajnneeti, kaarykram or sansaadhan 
 The need for environmental management can be seen from several perspectives
 paryaavaran prabandhan ke peeche ek aam vichaar tathaa prerana he kairiying capacity kii avadharana
 In simple terms, carrying capacity refers to the ability of a particular environmental system to hold the maximum number of organisms within itself
 haalaanki kai samskritiyon ko aitihaasik rup se vahan kshamta kii avadharana kii samaj thi, lekin iskaa mul malthusian theory main he

 anya paryaavarniya prabandhan pranaliyaan iesao 14001 maanak par aadhaarit hoti hai or kai pranaliyaan isko vibhinn tareekon se vistaarit karti hai: a few other strategies also exist that rely on simple methods of differentiation, rather than developing top-down management "systems" that use performance audit and full cost accounting
