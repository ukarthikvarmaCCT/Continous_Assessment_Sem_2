 During his time, the Nath and Mahanubhav sects were promoted in Maharashtra
 r Saint Shiromani Sri Namdevji was born at sunrise on "kartik Shukla Ekadashi Samvat 1327, Sunday" on October 26, 1270, in "pandharpur", Marathwada, Maharashtra
 maharashtra ke satara jile main krishna nadi ke kinare basaa "narsi bamani gaanv, jila parabhani unka paitruk gaanv he
" sant shiromani shri namdev ji kaa janm "shimpi", jise rajasthan main "chhipa" bhi kehete he, parivaar main hua tha
 His father's name was Damasheth and mother's name was Gonai
 inkaa parivaar bhagwaan vitthal kaa param bhakt tha
 Namdevji was married to Kalyan resident Rajai and had four sons and daughters-in-law namely "narayana - Ladabai", "vitthal - Godabai", "mahadev - Yesabai", and "govind - Sakrabai" and a daughter named Limbabai
 shri namdev ji kii badi bahan kaa naam aaubai tha
 One of his grandchildren was named Mukund and his maid was "sant Janabai", who lived at the house of Damasheth even before the birth of Sant Namdevji
 sant shiromani shri namdevji ke nanaaji kaa naam gomaji or naniji kaa naam umabai tha
 Saint Namdevji accepted Visoba Khecher as Guru
 visoba khechar kaa janm sthaan paithan tha, jo pangarpur se pachaas kos dur "ondhya nagnath" naamak pracheen shiv kshetra main hai
 In this temple, he taught Saint Shiromani Shri Namdevji and made him his disciple
 sant namdev, sant gyaneshwar ke samakaleen the or umr main unase 5 saal bade the
 Sant Namdev, Sant Dnyaneshwar, Sant Nivrithinath, Sant Sopanadev along with his sister Bahub Muktabai and other contemporary saints traveled all over Maharashtra with North India and composed "abhang" and taught Janata Janardhana the lesson of Samata and Prabhu-bhakti
 sant gyaneshwar ke paralokagaman ke baad duusare saathi santon ke saath inhone puure bharat kaa bhraman kiya
 He wrote compositions in Marathi as well as Hindi
 inhone atharah varsho tak punjab main bhagavannam kaa prachaar kiya
 Some of his compositions are still found in the Sikh religious book "guru Granth Sahib"
 isamen sant namdevji ke 61pad sangrahit hai
 Even today his composed abhangas are sung with devotion and love all over Maharashtra
 ye samvath 1407 main samadhi main leen ho gaye
 During the time of Sant Namdevji, Nath and Mahanubhav sects were promoted in Maharashtra
 nath panth "alakh niranjan" kii yogaparak sadhana kaa samarthak tathaa bahyadambaron kaa virdohi tha or mahanubhav panth vaidic karmkand tathaa bahudevopasana kaa virdohi hote hue bhi murtipuja ko sarvatha nishiddh nahin maanata tha
 Apart from these, the worship of "vithoba" of Pandharpur was also prevalent in Maharashtra
 sant namdevji pangarpur main vaari pratha shuru karwaane ke janak hai
 Under this practice, even today, the general public used to do Ashari and Kartiki Ekadashi every year as "vari" of Pandharpur for their darshans, such wari is called "varkari"
 vitalopasna kaa yah "panth" "warkari" sampradaay kehalaata he
 Shri Namdev is considered the chief saint of this sect
 warkari sant namdev ke samay ke sambandh main vidwaanon main matbhed he
 The reason for the differences is that there have been five saints named Namdev in Maharashtra and they all have done a little "abhang" and composition
 aavate kii "sakal santagatha" main namdev ke naam par 2500 abhang milte hai
 Of the nearly 600 abhangas, there is only the imprint of Namdev or "nama" and in the remaining "vishnudasanama"
 namdev ji kaa janm 26 oktober 1270, ravivaar main pratham sanvatsar, samvath 1327, karthik shukla ekadshi ko pangarpur main hua tha
 Namdevji was born in Pandharpur near Dama Sheth "shimpi", a native of a village called Narsi Brahmani, also known as "chhipa" in Rajasthan

 Those who saw God in the idol of Namdev Pandharpur's "vitthal" started to experience Khecher everywhere after coming in contact with him
 unako premabhakti main gyaan kaa samavesh ho gaya
 Dr
 Mohan Singh calls "namdev" a disciple of Ramanand
 parantu maharashtra main inaki bahumanya guru parampara is prakaar he -gyaneshwar ji or namdev ji ne uttar bharat kii saath-saath yatra kii thi
 Dnyaneshwar went to a place called Kolayat in Marwar with Namdev Ji
 vahaan se lautakar gyaneshwarji ne "aalandi" main shake 1218 main samadhi le lee
 With the disconnection of Dnyaneshwar, Namdevji's mind was moved from Maharashtra and he went towards Punjab
 gurudaspur jile ke "ghumaan" naamak sthaan par aaj bhi namdev ji kaa mandir vidyaman he
 There is also a "cult" going on in a limited area
 santon ke jivan ke saath katipay chamatkaari ghatnaayen judi rahati he
 In the character of Namdev too, by order of the Sultan, his dead cow should be kept alive, after the Pujari's objection to the Kirtan in front of the Lord Jagmohanji temple in front of him, the westward gate of his door is turned towards the west, incident in Marwar in Pali district of Rajasthan
 There is also an account of the incident of the mythical temple of Lord Krishna, locally called Lord Jagmohanji, in a village called "barsa" near Lets iskaa ullekh "hansanirvaani sant mohananandji maharaj" dwaara apane hastlikhit pustak main kiya hai, jis par shodh kar paali ke "gudaayendala gaanv" nivasee ""shri ashok aar

 Where the founder of "namdev Bhakti Sampradaya Sangh"
 Sri Ramakrishna Jagannath Bagade Maharaj, Pune confirmed this place by conducting a national level session in 2005), Including milk of Vitthal's idol on his hand, etc
 maharashtra ke pangarpur sthit vitthal mandir ke mahadwar par shake 1272 main parivaar ke ek sadsy ko chhodkar sanjivan samadhi le lee
 Some scholars consider his mausoleum as Ghuman, but majority are in favor of Pandharpur
 bisoba khechar se diksha lene ke purv tak ye sagunopa the
 Used to worship Vitthal of Pandharpur
 diksha ke uparaant inaki vitthalbhakti sarvavyaapak ho gai
 According to the Maharashtrian saint tradition, he had devotion to Nirgun, in which there was no discrimination of virtuous Nirguna
 unhone marathi main kai sau abhang or hindi main sau ke lagbhag pad rache hai
 His designations include both the kundalini-yoga-sadhana of Hatha Yoga and the "talabeli" of Premabhakti
 nirguni kabir ke samaan namdev main bhi vrath, tirth aadi bahyadambar ke prati upeksha tathaa bhagavannam evam satguru ke prati aadar bhav vidyaman he
 In the footsteps of Kabir, the expression of the name yatra-tatra is visible
 kabir se purv namdev ne uttar bharat main nirgun bhakthi kaa prachaar kiya, jo nirvivaad he
 You have made pilgrimage thrice and have been traveling with saints
 jyon jyon aapaki aayu babbti gai, tyon tyon aapkaa yash failata gaya
 You campaigned in the South a lot
 aapke saathi sant gyaneshwar ji paralok gaman kar gaye to aap bhi kuch uparam rahane lag gaye
 In the last days of his life, Shri Namdevji again came to Pandharpur and on Saturday, July 3, 1350, he attained salvation by taking the family "sanjeevan Samadhi"
 aaj bhi unke bhakt is din ko "shri namdev samadhi diwas" ke rup main yaad karke apane ko dhanya samajhate he
 He also took samadhi in the stairs leading to the temple of Sri Vitthal Bhagavan
 unki antim ichha bhi yahi thi kii shri hari vitthal ke darshanath jo bhi bhakt mandir main pravesh kare tab unki raj kan mere maathe par pade or wo shri vitthal ke darshan kare 
 aaj bhi wo sthaan "shri namdev pyri" ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 The bani pronounced by Namdev ji is also found in Gurugranth Sahib
 bahut sari vaani dakshin va maharashtra main gaai jaati he
 Reading your speech brings peace to the mind and leads to devotion
 ek din namdev ji ke pita kisi kaam se baahar ja rahe the
 He told Namdev ji that now he will serve Thakur in his place like giving bath to Thakur, keeping the temple clean and offering milk to Thakur
 jaise sari maryaada main purna karata hoon vaise tum bhi karnaa
 Don't see carelessness or laziness otherwise Thakur ji will get angry
 namdev ji ne vaisaa hi kiya jaise pitaaji samajhakar gaye the
 When he filled the bowl of milk and placed it before Thakur ji and sat with folded hands and kept watching how Thakur ji drinks milk
 Where did Thakur drink milk? He was a stone idol
 namdev ko is baat kaa pataa nahin tha ki thakur ko chammach bharkar doodh lagaaya jaataa va shesh doodh pandit pi jate the
 They started praying, Lord! i am your small servant, i have brought milk and please accept it
 bhakt ne apni bechaini is prakaar pragat kii - Oh God! i have brought this milk from the Kapla cow
 he mere gobind! yadi aap doodh pi lenge to meraa man shant ho jayega nahin to pitaaji naaraaz honge
 i have put a bowl of gold before you
 pie! avashya pie! maine koi paap nahin kiya
 If you drink milk daily from my father, then why are you not taking it from me? Oh God! Have mercy pitaaji mujhe pehle hi bura va nikamma samajhate hai
 If you did not drink milk today, i am not well
 pitaaji mujhe ghar se baahar nikaal denge
 The task that Namdev's father could not do his whole life was done by Namdev
 us maasoom bachche ko pandito kii baimani kaa pataa nahin tha
 He kept praying to Thakur ji
 ant main prabhu bhakt kii bhakthi par khinche hue aa gaye
 Laughed by the stone statue
 namdev ne iskaa zikr is prakaar kiya he - a devotee settled in the heart of the Lord
 namdev ko dekhakar prabhu hans pade
 Laughing, he moved both hands and drank milk
 doodh pikar murti phir waisi hi ho gai
 Namdev ji went home after feeding milk
 is prakaar prabhu ne unako saakshaat darshan die
 This was Namdev's first victory on the path of devotion
 shuddh hryday se kii hui prarthana se unke paas shaktiyaan aa gai
 He became a person of devotion and the words that came out of his mouth would be true
 jab aapke pitaaji ko yah gyaan hua ki aapane thakur main jaan daal di va doodh pilaayaa to vah bahut prasann hue
 He thought his total had become successful

 Kumar gained immense popularity in India after defeating the world's best bantamweight boxer, even though he lost the next match
 jeet ke baad unhone jo ek baat kahi thi usase kai log kaaphi prabhavit hue the, unhone kaha tha, "sapane ve nahin hai jo ham sote hue dekhte hai
 Dreams are those that don't let us sleep
 "they lost in the quarterfinals, but their popularity remained the same
 olympic khatm hone ke kuch hafton ke baad kumaar ne sweekaar kiya ki ve ab bhi us haar kaa dard mahasoos karte hai or isse vishwaas bana rahata he
 He said that the person whom he considers ideal is himself
 kumaar kehete hai ki haalanki unhone bharat ke logon kaa dil to jeet liya, lekin "sach to ye hai ki main ek haara hua vyakti hum, main swarna nahin jeet sakaa"
 kumaar ke mutabik isaki bharpai kii shuruyaat aane vaale rashtramandal khelon or vishwa champinyaships main swarna padak jeetne se hi ho saktaa he: "ye sirf ek hi medal he jise kaaphi mehnat se hasil kiya jaataa he ‚Äì swarna

 unhone kaha ki yahi sabase badi vajah he ki abhinav bindra ek bhartiya hero hai
 Regarding staying positive even after the defeat, he says, "I get a lot of information about people and companies around me

 He said that there is a specialty in them that they are able to separate the unnecessary things

 The Faizabad-born player says that boxing is an addiction, but with the result: "to win you may have to hit your opponent's boxer more and harder, but you also get hurt

 bhartiya dal ke senior mukkebaaz hone ke naate akhil kumaar bure samay main bhi apana josh banaae rakhte hai: "main jis tarah kaa bartaav karata hum, mere junior avashya hi uskaa anukaran karte honge
"ve is baat se kaaphi khush hai ki aakhirkaar bhartiya mukkebaajon ne medal jeetna shuru kar diya he
 To young boxers like Jeetendar and Vijender, he says: "don't just win medals, snatch them"
 Boxing in India has acquired a new dimension
 kumaar bataate hai, "chunki hamamen se zyaadaatar log dur-daraaj ke ilaake se aate hai, aise main koi bhi ye nahin jaanata he ki hamaari kaabiliyat kya he"
 Kumar said that he is very happy that women's boxing has also been included in the 2012 London Olympics
 kumaar ne kaha, "mahila mukkebaaji main hamaare paas bahut acchhee khilaadi hai or landan games main medal kii ummid kii ja sakati he
 

but to include women, we men have to sacrifice four classes "
 scoring system main hue badlaav ko lekar kumaar khush nahin he or ve sochate hai ki isse ye khel aasaan ho jayega or iskaa aakarshan bhi kam hoga
 "boxing was earlier remembered for the style and elegance of its great players, but now everyone will have to be extremely careful during the match after the change
" haal hi main shooting ke trial system ko lekar hue vivaad ke bare main jab unase poocha gaya to kumaar ne kaha ki apane-apane tarkon par donon hi paksh sahi the
 "trial has always been important, it gives even less popular players a chance to make it to the national team by showing their abilities, but Bindra's case was a bit different, he is an Olympic champion and he has consistently done well at the international level
 So you can't ignore them for the team "

 When Kajal marries Engineer Raj by profession, he and his father, automatically assume that he is rich
 yahan tak ki do bacchon ke janm or vivaah ke kai saalon main bhi vah nahin badalati
 An example of this happens when Kajal meets her old friend Nisha and says that her husband is a big business man, her family owns many cars and lives in a big bungalow, but Nisha, who is actually Amir Satch She knows
 jab jaahnvi, raaj ke maalik saahani kii bhatiji videsh se aati hai, vah hawaii adde par raaj se milti he or maanati he ki vah car chaalak he
 He then leaves her stranded on the road with her belongings, regardless of what her boss will say
 jahnavi samay par acchhee tarah se karyaalay pahaunchi or raaj ke ravaiye kii prashansa kii
 When she learns that he is a married man, she is still adamant on marrying Raj
 vah pehali baar ek dukaan par kaajal se milti he, jahaan ve donon raaj ke liye casette player kharidne jate hai
 The family listens to a tape given by Jahnavi in which she confesses her love
 raaj se shaadi karne ke prayaas main, jahnavi shahar ke ganesh mandir ke andar laalchee kaajal se milti he
 She offers two crore rupees in exchange for Raj's marriage
 tab kaajal, ise dhan or aasaan jivan paane kaa avasar maanate hue, achaanak uske prastaav ko sweekaar karti he
 Kajal forced Raj to compromise and divorced Raj himself by marrying Raj and Jahnavi to comply with the Hindu Marriage Act; Thinking that he and Jahnavi would live happily together and share Raj
 uske baad vah sauda main mili dhan kaa upyog ek vishaal haveli or kai car kharidne ke liye karti he
 The bungalow she buys turns out to be Nisha's
 tab kaajal ne use taana maar ke kaha ki usne apane sapanom ko puraa kar liya he, jabaki nisha ke sapane ab sabakuch khone ke baad tut gaye hai
 Nisha reminds Kajal that she sold her house and property for the treatment of her ailing husband, while Kajal has sold her husband for money; And to some extent, Kajal is poorer than that
 kaajal ne khud ko prabhavayukt vyakti main dhaala or isse apane parivaar kii upeksha kar rahi
 Raj initially feels rejected by Kajal and did not get close to Jahnavi
 lekin bacchon or raaj ko jahnavi ke saath saathi miltaa he, jo unhen pyaar or sneh ke saath dekhati he
 She transforms herself and becomes a normal Indian housewife
 ab kaajal ko pataa chalata he ki vah apane parivaar se kitni dur chali gai he
 She forgets her wedding anniversary and holds a birthday party for her daughter's birthday, without realizing that Raj has never been attracted to the lavish lifestyle and thus pushing her towards Jahnavi
 kaajal sudharne kii koshish karti he
 When nothing works, Kajal slaps Jahnavi and accuses her of stealing her husband
 tab vah jahnavi ko ghar se baahar phenkane kii koshish karti he, lekin iskaa koi phayda nahin hua, kyonki raaj ne jahnavi ke saath jane kaa faisla kiya
 The children also decide to live with Jahnavi and his father
 duusari ore kaajal, apane parivaar ko chhodkar chale jane se vyakul ho jaati he
 She donates all her money
 jab vah jaanati he ki raaj or bachche america ja rahe hai, to vah hawaii adde par jaati he
 She finds them ready to go
 lekin aakhri minute main, jahnavi raaj ko bataaya ki vah akele america ke liye ja rahi he, lekin vah sachmuch akeli nahin he
 She is expecting Raj's child
 jahnavi sweekaar karti he ki yadhyapi kaajal ne apane pati ko bech diya tha, lekin vah hi thi jisane use kharidne kii peshkash kii or is tarah use bhi apni dendariyon kaa bhugtan karnaa chahie
 So, the film ends with Kajal coming back to her family and Jahnavi moving to New York forever

 Chhayavad is that poetic stream of the romantic rise of Hindi literature which circa AD From 1918 to 1936, there was a major epoch
 atmabhivyakti, prakruti prem, nari prem, maanvikaran, saanskrithik jaagran, kalpana kii pradhanta aadi chhayavaadi kavy kii pramukh visheshtaayen hai
 Chhayavad fully distinguished the standing poetry in Hindi
 iske baad brajabhasha hindi kavy dhara se baahar ho gai
 It gave new words, symbols and images to Hindi
 iske prabhaav se is daur kii gadhy kii bhashaa bhi samrudh hui
 The era of Shadowism in Hindi poetry came after the Dwivedi era
 dvivedi yug kii kavita neeras upadeshaatmak or itivrittatmak thi
 Kalpnapradhan, rebellious poetry was composed while revolting against it in shadowism
 yah bhashaa or bhaavon ke str par apane daur ke bangla ke suprasiddh kavi or nobel puraskaar vijeta rabindranath thakur kii gitanjali se bahut prabhavit hui
 It was also influenced by ancient Sanskrit literature and medieval Hindi literature
 isamen buddha darshan or sufi darshan kaa bhi prabhaav lakshith hota he
 The Shadow Age was a universal development of the cultural and literary awakening that began in the national periphery with Bharatendu Yug
 kavi ke keval sookshm bhavatmak darshan kaa hi nahin, 'chaaya' se uske sookshm kalabhivyajan kaa bhi parichay miltaa he
 His poetry has semiotics and phonetics rather than speech
 anubhuti kii nigudhata ke kaaran asphutata bhi he
 There is a new sense of raga in the style or a new expression
 dvivedi yug main kavita kaa dhaanchaa padya kaa tha
 In fact, only the management of prose was translated into it, the language also became prose
 chhayavaad ne padya kaa dhaanchaa todakar khadi boli ko kaavyatmak bana diya
 The poem had a voluminous history, the poetry of cinematography had an emotional encapsulation, the poetry of cinematography had an emotional intonation
 bhav ke anuroop hi chhayavaad kii bhashaa or chand bhi ragaatmak or rasaatmak ho gaya
 Brijbhasha was followed by the revival of lyricism by Chhayavada
 chhayavaad yug ke pratinidhi kavi hai- prasad, niraala, pant, mahadevi, ramkumar
 The foregoing associates are Makhanlal and 'naveen'
 geetkavy ke baad chhayavaad main bhi mahakavy kaa nirmaan hua
 Tulsidas, like 'swant', had moved on the path of the Lok Sangraha, in the same way, the poet of Chhayavad has moved from the private world of solitude to the public world with respect to 'swatam'
 prasad kii 'kamayani' or pant kaa 'lokayatan' iskaa pramaan he
 'kamayani' is towards Vindu in the Indus, 'lokayatan' is towards the Indus in Vindu
 sanwat 1917 ke aasapaas maithilisharan gupt, mukutadhar pandeya aadi kavi khadiboli kavy ko adhik kalpanamay, chitramay or antarbhaav vyanjak rup-rang dene main pravrutt hue yah svachhnd or nutan paddati apana rasta nikaal rahi thi ki rabindranath kii rahasyatmak kavitaaon kii dhooma hui
 And many poets simultaneously turned to solitude as mysticism and symbolism or pictorialism
 chitrabhasha yaa abhivyanjan paddati par hi jab lakshya tik gaya tab uske pradarshan ke liye loukik yaa alokik prem kaa kshetra hi baaki samajha gaya
 Poetry moving within this bounded area assumed the name Chhayavad
 chhayavaadi shabd kaa prayog do arthon main samajhnaa chaiye
 One is in the sense of mysticism, where it relates to the poetic object, that is, where the poet consults that infinite and unknown beloved in many ways in a very pictorial language
 is arth kaa doosraa prayog kavy-style yaa paddati-vishesh ke vyapak arth main hota he‚Äô chhayavaad kaa saamanytah arth hua prastut ke sthaan par uski vyanjana karanevaali chaaya ke rup main aprastut kaa kathan
 Shadowism was practiced as a reaction to the dry chronicles of the Dwivedi period
 jaise, dhul kii dheri main anjaane, chhipe hai mere madhumay gaan
 The perception of spiritual shadow in the subtle but expressed beauty of nature, i think, should be a universally accepted interpretation of Shadowism
 ‚Äô At the end of the Second World War, a wave of new consciousness raged all over the country
 san 1929 main mahatma gandhi ke netritv main bharatvarsh videshi gulaami ko jhaad-phenkane ke liye katibaddh ho gaya
 It should not be limited to politics alone
 yah sampurna desh kaa aatm swaroop samajhane kaa praytn tha or apni galatiyon ko sudhaar kar sansar kii samrudh jatiyon kii prati- dwandvita main agrasar hone kaa sankalp tha
 In short, it was a great cultural movement
 chittagat unmukhataa is kavita kaa pradhan udgam thi or badalte hue maano ke prati drudh aasthaa iskaa pradhan sambal
 The poets of this category were highly endowed with talent and were highly conscious of social disparities and inconsistencies
 style kii drushti se bhi ye pehle ke kaviyon se ekadam bhinn the
 His work was predominantly thematic
 san 1920 kii khadiboli kavita main vishaywastu kii pradhanta bani hui thi
 But in the poem that follows, the poet's own raga-vigyan prevailed
 vishay apane aap main kaisaa he ? yah mukhya baat nahin thi
 Rather the main thing remained that how does the subject look after the subject is stunned by the raga-viraga? As a result, the subject became secondary and the poet was the chief
 1920 ke aasapaas, yug kii udbuddha chetana ne bahya abhivyakti se niraash hokar, jo atmbaddh antarmukhi sadhana aarambh kii, vah kavy main chhayavaad ke rup main abhivyakt hui‚Äô Whatever the meaning of the word Chhayavad, but in practical terms it represents all the poems of Prasad, Nirala, Pant, Mahadevi which were written between 1918 and 36 AD
 ‚Äô ve aage likhte hai- ‚Äòchhayavaad us rashtriya jaagran kii kaavyatmak abhivyakti he jo ek ore puraani rudhiyon se mukti chahta tha or duusari ore videshi paradheenata se
 ' prasad ji ant main kehete hai- chhayavaadi kavita bhartiya drushti se anubhuti or abhivyakti kii bhangima par adhik nirbhar karti he
 Phoneticism, semiotics, beauty, nature-law, and the variability of self-perception along with healing curvature are characteristic of Chhatism
 ‚Äô We can divide the major trends of Shadowism under three or two headings

 Yes, we are talking about Sonbarsa Raj, if you want to see a village standing on the bank of Koshi, then in this village you will know how despite being called the river of mourning in Bihar, how did people here compete with it Teach and how Hussey is living happily
 sonbarasa raaj jaisaa kii naam se hi spost he, sonbarasa = sona + barasaa yani jahaan khushiyon kii varsha hoti he aisa he; ye gaanv
 or raaj isliye kyonki ye raja kaa gaanv he
 History - aarambh main sonbarasa raaj kshetra anguttarap kehalaata tha or uttar bihar prasiddh vaishali mahajanapad ke seemaa par sthit tha
 After the country lost its power, it became a victim of Magadha imperialism, this is attested by the Mauryan pillar found in the surrounding area
 sonbarasa raaj ke sate biratpur gaanv main khudaai ke dauraan bodh dharm ke kuch smriti chinh mili he jisase ye bhi kaha ja saktaa he kii yahan bodh dharman kaa bhi pradurbhaav rahaa hoga
 Viratpur village gets its name during the time of unknown habitat of Pandavas during Mahabharata, which also proves that they must have passed through this village
 bhugolic sthiti sonbarasa raaj saharsa jile kaa ek pramukh gaanv he jiske uttar main soha or biratpur, dakshin main pararia, pashchim main sugama or kosi nadi or purab main dehad gaanv hai
 The total area of sonbarsa Raj is xxrep 7 
 so much, the entire village is a flat fertile area, but due to population density it is cultivated only in few parts, with seasonal fruits like mango and litchi and guava
 Some banana cultivation is also seen
 yahan kii mitti chikani or domat he jo dhan or gehun kii fasal ke upyukt he, yahan saal main teen fasal ho jaati he, kahi kahi dalhan ke bich, tilhan fasal ugane kaa bhi mil jaataa he
 Every year, this village has to be two to four even due to the devastation of the river Koshi, which is called the mourning of Bihar, every year after the Koshi, Leela kayo is taken
 harek varsh kam se kam 10-15 logo ko doobane se maut ho jaati he
 At the same time, floods also bring epidemics with them and in the absence of proper treatment even today children are seen dying
 pramukh nadi - The Koshi river, which is called the mourning of Bihar, mainly passes through the western end of this village, which serves as the border area of other neighboring western villages
 harek varsh isaki vibheeshikaa jaan maal ke sang arthvyavastha ko bhi kshati pahunchati he
 Population and literacy - According to the 2011 census, the total population of this village is 1645, of which 596 are male and 449 are female
 prashasnic vibhaajan -sonbarasa raaj prashasnic taur par bhi bharaa puraa he, gaanv main police thana, aspataal, maweshiyon kaa aspataal, daakghar, do madhya vidhyalay, ek urdu madhya vidhyalay, ek ucch vidhyalay or ek mahavidhyalay bhi he
 Also, this Sonbarsa Raj village being the Sonbarsa block has its own block headquarters
 shaikshanik santhaan -siksha main maamle is gaanv ko aap ek mishaal kah sakate he
 Nearly fifteen villages around it can be called Palanhar
 aas paas ke kareeb 15-20 ganvo main ucch vidhyalay nahin hone ke kaaran yah un sabhi gaanvon ke siksha kaa centre bindu he
 Its specialty is that the teacher here is knowledgeable and great as well as his style of teaching is like this, the students are more attracted, in a way you can say that there is a stronghold of education of about 15-20 villages around
 This village madhya vidhyalay - 3 ucch vidhyalay - 1 mahavidhyalay - 1 saath hi saath yahan teen chaar public skool bhi he jo shiksha ke paracham ko dur dur tak failaa rahaa he
 There is also no shortage of coaching institutes which provide quality education at low fees
 The school here teaches courses approved by the National Research, Scientific Council, but some public schools also teach the Central Board of Secondary Education
 paryaton sthal - chota gaanv ke hone ke vabjood bhi sonbarasa apane aap main kai mahatvapurn sthanon ko simate baitha he jo aitihaasik mahatv to rakhata hi he saath hi saath hamen adbhut vaastukala kaa namoona bhi dikhataa he
 1) raj-vilas or Maharaj Complex - This palace of Maharajadhiraj Sir Hariballabh Narayan Singh, situated in the lap of nature, not only looks at the history but also offers a unique piece of architecture, in the absence of protection, this fort today is on the verge of ruin But it stands for which is a matter of great concern
 ek chote se gaanv ke raja hone ke vabjood inhen sar kii oopaadhi se nawaja gaya tha ye hamare liye garv kii baat he
 This palace inscribed on the finest pages of history, today itself is shedding tears on its plight
 jarurat he ek bhagirathi prayaas kii jo ise phir se sanvaar sake
 maharaaja parisar kosi nadi ke kinare based is kile kii anupam chata dekhte hi banati he, bina cement or baaluu ke sirf khadiya or katthe ke balboote kadi kii gayi is aalishaan mahal kaa sondarya aaj bhi kuch kam nahin he, nakkashi or aadhunik vaastukala kaa bejod namoona kul milakar kah sakate he aap ise
 2) High School Sonbarsa - To say that this is a temple of education, but due to Maharajadhiraja made of Kar Kamloos, it is even more revered and visible, how its grandeur and carving is not less than a palace, two-storeyed Vastu experts have put all their knowledge in the construction of the building
 pure 5000 varg meter se bhi zyada main faile is vidhyalay kaa khud kaa do do khel ke maidan or aadhunik suvidhao se yukt ek vyayam shaala he
 The pride of this school also increases in this regard because it is the only village in entire Bihar after Bhagalpur which has the distinction of being a modern exercise school

 During the morning and evening prayers, crowds of devotees are formed on seeing the temple premises
 khaas tyoharon or parvo ke mauko par bhi yahan acchhee bheed jutati he
 4) Place of Religion - The specialness of Sonbarasa Raj is also that here all the temples are located in one place, not in the temple street Kucho, this temple group is called the place of religion
 yahan vibhinn devi-devataaon kii kareeb paanch se zyada mandir he jisame durga maan kaa prangan kuch zyada hi vishaal he
 Navaratras and Kali Puja are predominantly crowded and fairs are organized
 mandir se sata hi rajaao ke jamaane ke ek pokhar bhi he jo is mandir parisar kii mahatta or bhi badha detii he
 5) Salvation-place - Not as a tourist place, but it is being mentioned here that whoever comes in this village will definitely want to see this place once

 Nandavansha was founded by the first Chakravarti Emperor Mahapadmananda
 bhartiya itihaas main pehali baar ek aise samrajya kii sthapana hui jisaki simaaen ganga ke maidaanon ko long gai
 This empire was not actually a loose union of independent states or feudal lords but rather a powerful king force
 ye ek ekaraat kii chhatrachhaaya main ek akhand rajtantr tha, jiske paas apaar sanybal, dhanabal or janabal tha
 Chakravarti emperor Mahapadmananda conquered all the nearby dynasties and established a vast empire and implemented the system of central governance
 isiilie samraat mahapadam nand kokendriya shashan paddati kaa janak kaha jaataa he
 It is worth remembering what the kings of Nandavans donated to their heirs and future generations
 In Smith's words, "he forced 66 conflicting states not to overthrow each other and entrust themselves to a higher regulatory authority
" " ni:andeh nando ke utthan ko bhartiya raajnneeti ke utkarsh kaa pratik mana ja saktaa he
 This was confirmed in "mahananda" from the early three shlokas of the epic "krishna Charitra" composed by Emperor Samudragupta

 itihaas kii jaankaree ke anek vivaran puraanon, jain or buddha granthon evam unani itihaaskaaron ke varnan main praapt hote hai
 However, it can be said with certainty that Nanda was a Kshatriya dynasty whose most of the nature was of Indian governance tradition
 curtius kahata he ki sikandar ke samay shaashak kaa pita vastav main ek garib nai kaa betaa tha, unani lekhakon ke varnanon se gyaat hota he ki vah "vartmaan raja" agramas athwa jandrama tha, jisaki pahchaan dhananand se kii gai he
 His father was Mahapadmananda, which seems to be the Kshatriya varna from the appropriate statement of Curtius
 kuch puraana granth or jain granth "parishisht parvan main bhi use naapit kaa putr kaha gaya he
 Only one thing is clear from these many references that the king of Nandavans was of the justice justice Kshatriya varna
 nandavansh kaa pratham or sarvaprasiddh raja hua
 The Puranas count it only in the Shaishunag dynasty, but in the Buddhist and Jain Anushrutis it is considered the initiator of a new dynasty, which is correct
 use jain granthon main ugrasen or puraanon main mahapadmapati bhi kaha gaya he
 In the Kaliyugarajavrittantavale portions of the Puranas, it is given the nouns of Atibali, Mahakshatrantaka and and Parasurama
 spasht he, bahut badi senawale us raaj ne apane samakalik anek kshatriya rajwanshon kaa uchchhed kar apane bal kaa pradarshan kiya
 It is not surprising that with that immense wealth and military power, he undertook to conquer all the regions between the Himalayas and the Narmada
 uske jite hue pradeshen main akshvaku, paanchal, kauravy, kaashi, haihay, ashmak, vitihotra, kaling, shurasen, mithila, tathaa anya anek rajya shaamil the
 Nowhere between the Himalayas and Vindhyachal could there be a violation of his rule
 is prakaar usne sari prithvi par "ekarat, hokar rajya kiya
 The authenticity of these Puranic victories of Mahapadmananda is also proved by some scattered references to the Kathasaritsagar, the elephant cave records of Kharavel and some records from Mysore
 jain or buddha granthon se ye praapt hota hai ki mahapadmanand kii do raniyon thi rani avantika or ranimura or donon maharaniyaan hi behad sundar or khubasurat thi mahapadmanand kii raniyon ke bare main adhik jaankaree nahi milti hai The Puranas state the ten sons of Mahapadmananda as the heir
 vahaan unke naam milte hai Ganga Pal, Panduk, Pandugati, Bhootpal, Rashtrapal, Govishanak, Dashasiddhak, Kaivart and Dhananand, Chand Nand chandragupta maury nand vansh ke sasthaashak chakravarti samraat mahapadmanand ke ve putr the jinka vaastavik naam chandranand tha jinaki maa ekbrahraman parivaar se thi mahapadmanand ke baad unke putr dhananand raja hue jinke dar se sikandar bhi bhaag gaya tha
 Dhanananda beat the minister Chanakya and drove him out of the assembly, because Chanakya sat on the throne before Dhananand
 chanakya ne dhananand ke sautele bhai chandranand ko bhadakaakar dhananand ko dhokhe se chandranand se maravakar chandranand kro raja banaaya or chandranand kro chandragupta maury naam diya 
 The Sumalya of the Puranas seems to be difficult to match to any of the eight names other than Mahapadma mentioned in Buddhist texts
 kintu sabhi milakar sankhya kii drushti se navanand kahe jate the
 There is no dispute in this
 puraanon main un sabakaa rajyakaal 100 varshon tak bataaya gaya he - 88 varshon tak mahapadmanand kaa or 12 varshon tak uske putron kaa
 But the same person continued to rule for 88 years and subsequent successive 8 kings should rule only for 12 years, it does not seem wise
 sinhalai anushrutiyon main navanandon kaa rajyakaal 40 varshon kaa bataaya gaya he or use ham sahi maan sakate hai
 Accordingly, the Nawanandas circa 364 BC
 From 324 BC Ruled until

 Plutarch says that Chandragupta Maurya met Alexander and spoke of his lowliness and unpleasantness in public
 sambhav he, dhananand ko ukhaad phenkane ke liye chandragupta ne us videshi akramanakari ke upyog kaa bhi praytn kiya ho
 It is known from the "mahavanshatika" that the last Nanda was a tough ruler and a person of greedy and scrupulous nature
 sambhavat: is lobhi prakruti ke kaaran hi use dhananand kaha gaya
 He also insulted Chanakya
 isaki pushti mudrarakshas naatak se hoti he, jisase gyaat hota he ki chanakya apane pad se hataa diya gaya tha
 Humiliated, he took the oath of annihilation of the Nanda Empire and with the support of Prince Chandragupta Maurya, he succeeded in that task
 un donon ne us kaary ke liye punjab ke kshetron se ek vishaal sena taiyaar kii, jisamen sambhavat: kuch videshi tatv or lutere vyakti bhi shaamil the
 It is also known that Chandragupta had made a treaty with Parvatak in the overthrow of Dhanananda
 usne magadh par do akraman kiye, yah sahi prathit hota he, parantu "divyavdaan" kii yah anushruti ki pehle usne sidhe magadh kii rajdhani patliputra par hi dhaava bol diya tathaa asafal hokar use or chanakya ko apane praan bachaane ke liye vesh banaakar bhaagna padaa, sahi nahin prathit hoti
 Probably between them, 324 BC The war took place when Chandragupta started the Mauryan dynasty in Pataliputra, the capital of Magadha
 nando kaa samrajya saamaajik, aarthik, raajnneetik sampannataa evam sainya sanghathan kaa charam bindu tha
 His largest well-organized army had 2 xxrep 5 0 footmen, 8 xxrep 4 0 cavalry, 8000 war chariots, 6000 elephants
 jisaki sahaayta se samraat mahapadmanand ne uttar pashchim, dakshin purv disha main bahut badi sainik vijay praapt kii or us samay ke lagbhag sabhi aas pados ke samrajyo kaa ant kar ke un kaa namonishaan mitaa diya
 For this reason, in the Puranas, he has been called Sarvakshatrantaka or another Parashurama
 vishwa vijeta sikandar ne bharat par akraman ke samay samraat ghanaanand kii vishaltam sena dekh kar ke hausala post ho gaya 
 In front of such a huge power, even a great world conqueror like Alexander, understood his goodness in returning only by bowing down
 samraat mahapadmanand ne tatkaaleen bharat kii vistrut sabhi 16 mahajanapadon kaashi, kaushal, vajji, mall,chedi,vatsa,ank, magadh, avaneet, kuru, paanchal, gandhar kamboj,shurasen ,ashmak, evam kaling ko jitkar evam susangathit kar pratham baar sudrudh kendriya prashasan kii niv daali tathaa aage aane vaali peedi ke shaskaon ko shashan karne kii utkrisht paddati sikhalaai jiskaa prabhaav aadhunik shashan paddati main bhi dikhaai padataa he
 That is why Chakravarti emperor Mahapadmananda is called the father of central governance

 The main reason for their economic prosperity was systematic profit oriented foreign and internal trade

 a famous British scientist Richard Lynn published a paper on the size of the penis of a human
 is shodh main 113 deshon ke purushon ke privet part ke sies kaa vishleshan kiya gaya he
 a list of countries has also been made on this basis
 is list main bharat 110wein sthaan par he
 Congo tops the list with an average 'size' of 7
1 inches
 korea or cambodia sabase neeche hai
 India is above these two countries
 bhartiya purushon kaa 'ausat sies' 4 inch bataaya gaya he
 But questions are being raised on this
 saal 2006 main bharat main condom kaa sies tay karne ke liye kiye gaye 'sies survey' kii report ai thi
 The survey, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research, 'study on proprietary length and breadth specifications for condom-based anthropometric measurement', concluded that condoms found in the Indian market are larger in proportion to the sex size of men
 isiemr ke liye survey karne vaale dow sharma ne apni shodh report saal 2006 main bharat sarkaar ko saunp di thi
 However, no guidelines were issued for condom makers after this
 drugs and cosmetic act 1940 ke anuchhed 'aar' ke mutabik bharat main condom kaa sies kam se kam 6
7 inch rakhana anivaary he
 However, the survey took data of 1400 men, which included men aged 18‚Äì50
 isse pehle saal 2001 tak mumbai main ikattha kiye gaye data ke mutabik 60 pratishat bhartiya purushon ke privet part kii ausat lambaai 4
4 se 4
9 inch ke bich or 30 pratishat kii lambaai 4 se 4
9 inch bataai gai thi
 According to data released by Dr
 Richard, the average length of penis of Indian men is four inches
 unhone apni report kaa aadhaar isiemr ke survey ko banaaya he
 Therefore, questions are also being raised about this survey
 da open megsine kii ek report ke mutabik isiemr dwaara karaae gaye survey ke nattejey hi vishwasaneey nahin the
 Then how can any other survey done with this basis be reliable? isiemr ke survey ko behatar respance nahin mil paaya tha kyonki bharat main koi bhi purush is tarah ke survey ke liye taiyaar ho jaye yah baat bhi aasaan nahin he
 According to Dr
 RS Sharma, who conducted the survey for ICMR, he had to face a lot of difficulties in collecting data for the survey
 dow sharma ne saal 2001 main aankade ikattha karnaa shuru kiya tha
 It took them five years
 dow sharma kehete hai-"bhartiya purushon ke ling kaa ausat sies nikaalnaa baaki deshon se bhinn he kyonki yahan alag-alag jati or naslon ke log rahete hai
 "dr
 Sharma's team collected samples of men's private part sizes at seven centers - Patna, Guwahati, Cuttack, Chandigarh, Delhi, Mumbai and Hubli
 chandigarh main dow es ke singh ne yah survey kiya tha
 Dr
 Singh managed to take a sample of 220 men
 purushon ke ang kaa sies maapne ke liye ek kit banaai gai thi jo ang kii motaai or lambaai maapti thi
 It had two paper strips from which to measure
 ek purush ke kam se kam teen maap liye jate the or phir ausat ko antim maap maan liya jaataa tha
 Measuring the organ of men was also a major problem
 pehle iaiti khadgpur ke ek professor ne ang kaa maap lene ke liye ek digital camera viksit kiya lekin mahanga hone ke kaaran ise apanaaya nahin gaya tha
 Many practical problems were also introduced
 pehle to purushon ko survey main shaamil hone ke liye taiyaar karnaa hi mushkil tha
 Even if they were prepared in some way, they could not be comfortable while measuring
 unhen iske liye bold megsine aadi dikhaa kar taiyaar kiya jaataa tha
 Married men were allowed to bring their wives along
 iske baavjood sahi maap lene main kai mushkilen aati thim
 Dr
 Singh, who conducted a survey in Chandigarh, used to give men even a chance to join the survey
 kochi main bhi ausat sies maapne ke liye ek survey kiya gaya tha
 It was attended by 301 people and its results were published in 2007 in the International Journal of Impotence Research
 is survey ko sex rog visheshgy dow ke0 promudu ne kiya tha
 According to the survey by Dr
 Promudu, the average size was found to be 5
8 inches long
 haalanki unhone survey sirf kerala main kiya tha isliye ise samooche bharat kaa pratinidhi nahin mana ja saktaa
 But if Dr
 Promudu's survey is to be considered as standard, then in this list India goes above many countries including China
 is tarah dow lin kii research main kai khamiyaan najar aati hai
 But his report certainly sheds light on why there is such a difference in the 'size' of men from different regions of the world
 unhone ise maanav jati ke vikaas se joda he
 According to him, in ancient times, women used to compete for the development of their race by pregnant women
 is hode main apekshaakrit lambey privet part vaale purush baaji maar lete the
 But as the male race migrated from Africa to Europe, Asia, and other islands, the competition for pregnant women among them diminished
 is kaaran se purushon ke sharir main testosteron naam kaa hormone bhi kam hota gaya
 As a result, the size kept getting smaller
 dow lin kii shodh ke mutabik nigroyds kaa 'ausat sies' 6 inch hota he
 They are descendants of males living in Africa whereas the figure is 5
4 inches in the case of Coccodes males and 4
7 inches in the case of Mongoloid
 ye un purushon ke vanshaj he jo africa ko chhodkar europe or asia main bas gaye the

 a detailed study of the British Museum and Smithsonian crystal skulls was approved for publication in May 2008 by the Journal of Archaeological Science
 Using electron microscopes and x-ray crystallography, British and American researchers found that a rigid abrasive, such as corundum or diamond, was used on the cranium of the British Museum and was molded by a rotary disk tool made of a suitable metal

 In the early 1970s it remained under the temporary supervision of independent art renovator Frank Dorland, who, after examining it, claimed that it was fabricated without the care of natural crystal axes without the use of metal tools
 
 darland ne kaha ki use daanton par yantric ghisaai ke alaava koi bhi spasht kharonch ke nishaan nahin mili or usne anumaan lagaaya ki use pehle aprishkrut rup main, sambhawatah hiron kaa prayog karke banaaya gaya, or phir baarik dhalaai, ghisaai or paalish ret kaa prayog karke 150 se 300 varshon kii avadhi main kii gai

 Examination also established that the lower jaw was made of the same left-hand growing rhinestone from which the rest of the cranium formed
 uske utpaadan ke tareeke yaa taarikh ke bare main echpi ne koi jaanch nahin kii
 In addition to the signs of mechanical wear of the teeth noted by Darland, the Mayanist archaeologist Norman Hammond reported that the holes appear to be made from metal bores
