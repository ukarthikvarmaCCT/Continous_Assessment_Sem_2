 By studying the change in distance between Earth's epochs during the eclipses of Jupiter's satellite, Eo, Roemer suggested a way to exclude the time it takes for light to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit
 Although the first to calculate that method was Christian Huygens, which equaled 2,14,300 kilometers per second, Roemer is the only person to find the speed of light

 durgadas mahaan upanyaaskaar munshi premchand kaa aitihaasik upanyaas he jo mukhyat: urdu lipi main likhaa gaya or jiskaa hindi anuwaad pehali baar san 1915 main prakashit hua tha
 It has a struggling saga of a hero who was willing to cut his head for his motherland
 swayan premchand unka bakhaan karte hai
 In the words of Premchand - Rajputana has become very brave
 us marubhumi ne kitne hi nar-ratnon ko janm diya he; par vir durgadas apane anupam aatm-tyaag, apni niyaswaarth seva-bhakthi or apane ujjwal charitra ke liye kohnur ke samaan hai
 In others, along with valor, some sense of violence and malice will also be found, Kirti will also be fascinated, pride will also be there; But Durgadas was a saintly man even after being brave
 isamen premchand ne apni rachanashiltaa kaa parichay dete hue mahatvapurn tathy samahit kiye hai
 Currently its booklet is presented by Bharatiya Jnanpith whose first edition from this press was published on 1 January 2011

 There have been great knights in Rajputana
 us marubhumi ne kitne hi nar-ratnon ko janm diya he, par vir durgadas apane anupam aatm-tyaag, apni niyaswaarth sevabhakti or apane ujjwal charitra ke liye kohnur ke samaan hai
 In others, there will also be a sense of violence and malice in some places along with bravery, Kirti will also be fascinated, will also have pride, but Durgadas was also a saintly man
 inhen kaarnon se hamane vir-ratna durgadas kaa charitra baalkon ke saamne rakhaa he
 We have tried that the language of the book should be simple and idiomatic and interest of children should be generated in it

 Durgadas along with Ananddas Khechi sent the prince to the village of Dugba to the house of Jayadeva Brahmin
 aurangzeb nen kotwaal bheje or donon raniyon nen aatmahatya kar lee
 Those who survived the battle took the dead bodies of the queens with Durgadas and performed dah kriya in the hills of Abu
 sab log brahman ke yahan gaye or ek din baad sab kalyangarh durgadas ke ghar chale gaye vahaan durgadas kii budhi maan tathaa uskaa bhai jaskaran or uskaa betaa tejkaran tha
 The emperor issued a decree at the behest of Jaswant Singh's nephew to bring all the Rajputs alive or dead
 sab rajput bhaage, idhar durgadas soningi ke saath awagadh chale gaye vahaan shoningi nen ek sandukchi dete hue bolaa "yah raja kaa diya hua he, ise main surakshit nahi rakh saktaa ise tum le lo tathaa jodhpur main jo yuvak raja bane use de dena, kholana mat!" Durgadas went away with that sandook
 raste main do rajputon ko mughal sipaahi ghere the jisamen se ek mar gaya tha or mahasingh naamak ghayal tha
 Saving them, Durgadas killed Joravar and took Mahasinha to his house
 subah hote hi durgadas apane bete tathaa bhai ke saath maan se vidaa lekar jane laga or vah sandukchi apane naukar nathu ko de di
 Shamsher Khan came after him and brutally killed Durgadas's mother
 a soldier of Shamsher went to Mahan Singh Mado with Khudabaksh and Nathu went to inform Durgadas about his mother's death
 durgadas mata ke mrityu kii baat se agbabula ho sidhaa jaakar shamsher khan ko maar daalaa
 Similarly, he drove Aurangzeb away from Marwar while doing many great things
 ab durgadas boodha ho chalaa tha usne ajitsingh ko rajgaddi par bitha diya, ajitsingh ghamand main aakar durgadas ko maarane kii koshish kii par aakhir use bhi pataa chal hi gaya ki jiske dar se aurangzeb bhaag gaya use wo kya kar sakegaa
 Veer Durgadas left from Jodhpur and stayed with Rana Jai singh for a few days and then went to Ujjain, worshiping Mahakaleshwar with reverence in the remaining days
 sanwat 1765 main unka dehanth ho gaya
 Veer Durgadas Rathod died but his heroic story will remain immortal forever

 google kii kamyaabi kaa ek bada hissaa pej rank kahe jane vaale patent kiye hue elgorithm ke kaaran he, jo khoj ke sutara kaa milan kar web prishthon ko rank pradaan karata he
 The earlier key word-based method of ranking search results, which was used in many search engines, was more popular than Google at times, ranking pages based on how often the search term in a page Repeated or how strongly the search terms are associated within each resulting page
 pej rank kalan vidhi maanav janit kadiyon ke vishleshan bajaay yah maanati he ki kai mahatvapurn prishthon se jude web pej swayan mahatvapurn ho sakate hai
 The algorithm calculates a recursive score for pages and is based on the equivalent addition to the page rank of the pages associated with them
 pej rank ko maanav ke mahatv kii avadharanaon kaa acha sahasambandhi mana ja saktaa he
 In addition to pagerank, Google has over the years adopted several other secret criteria for determining the ranking of pages on results lists, which are reported to be about 200 different indicators
 spamaron se bachane or google ke pratispaddhiyon par badhat barkaraar rakhane ke liye inkaa vivaran gupt rakhaa jaataa he
 The exact percentage of web pages indexed by Google is not known, as the calculation is actually very difficult

 He has given a detailed and detailed explanation of Nirukta
 isse uski tatkaaleen sthiti kaa pataa chalata he
 The Vrittikar has indicated in his instinct the interpretation of the ancient commentators
 vritti main sthaan par nutan paath prastut karne tathaa vividh pathantaron par samalochanatmak prakaash daalane main durgacharya ne apni vishleshnatmak buddhi kaa parichay diya he
 Thus his attitude also presents the form of a critical version of the Nirukta Granth received in his time
 durgacharya vedon ke mahaan marmajna the
 The introduction of his profound pedigree comes from the detailed interpretation of the Vedamantras quoted in Nirukta
 mantra main aae hue ek ek shabd kaa inhone vidvattapurna vishleshan kiya he
 He also faced difficulty in interpreting deep mantras somewhere
 inhone apane jivan ke sambandh main kuch bhi nahin likhaa he
 His name in a manuscript of Vritti is 'durgasinh' - Krijavarthayana Niruktavrittau Jambumargashramanivasin Acharyabhagavadurgsingh Kritau
 isse vidit hota he ki vrittikaar kaa puraa naam durgasingh tha
 The mention of the words 'ashram' and 'bhagavat' in the above line are indicative that they were living their lives as saints or ascetics of any sect at that time
 dow lakshmanaswaroop uparyukt pankti ke aadhaar par yah maanate hai ki inhone apni vritti jammu ke nikat sthit kisi ashram main likhi thi
 Pt
 Bhagavadatta estimates him to be a resident of Gujarat province

 He did not explain the Richa of the Rigveda quoted in the Nirukta, expressing some opposition to Vasistha

 An entrepreneur is an aspiring leader who combines land, labor and capital to create new products or provide services
 yah shabd french bhashaa se grahan kiya gaya he or ise sabase pehle irish arthshaastri richard cantilon dwaara paribhaashit kiya gaya tha
 Entrepreneur in English is a term used for a personality type that is willing to start a new venture or project on its own and is ready to accept full responsibility for its outcome
 aisa mana jaataa he ki jin-baptiste se, ek french arthshaastri, ne 1800 main sabase pehle udhyami shabd gadha tha
 He said of an entrepreneur "the person who runs an enterprise, especially a contractor who acts as an intermediary between capital and labor"
 udhyamita aksar mushkil or pechida he, jiske parinamswaroop kai nae udhyam asafal ho jate hai
 The term entrepreneur is often used as a synonym for the founder
 aam taur par, udhyami shabd us par lagu hota he jo bazaar main jagah bana kar us utpaada yaa seva ko pradaan kar ke naam sthapit karata he jo ki vartmaan main astitv main nahin he
 Entrepreneurs identify opportunities in the market and by employing their resources effectively take full advantage of an outcome that replaces current ideas in a field
 paryvekshak unhen avasar praapt karne ke liye ek ucch str ke nijee, peshewar yaa aarthik rup se jokhim lene ko taiyaar vyakti banane ke icchhuk ke rup main dekhte hai
 Business entrepreneurs are considered to be fundamentally important in capitalist society
 kuch log vyapaar udhyamiyon ko yaa to "raajnneetik udhyamiyon" athwa "bazaar udhyamiyon" ke rup main vibhajit karte hai, jabaki saamaajik udhyamiyon ke pramukh uddeshyon main ek saamaajik or / yaa paryaavarniya laabh kaa nirmaan shaamil he
 The credit for coining the term "entrepreneur" goes to jean-baptiste, a 19th-century economist
 "udhyami" shabd french bhashaa ke shabd se grahan kiya gaya
 In French the verb "entreprendre" means "to act" in which "entre" is the Latin word meaning "between" and "prendre" means "to take"
 french main ek vyakti jo kriya karata he, us kriya ke ant main "eur" lagaaya jaataa he jo angreji ke "er" kii tarah prayukt hota he
 "unternehmer" is equivalent to the German word and, interestingly, "unternehmensforschung" is the German equivalent of operation research, although the anglo-saxon model of business is quite contradictory to the notion of management as a science
 scollar robert
 bi rik netritv, prabandhan kshamta or team nirmaan ko ek udhyami ke aavashyak gun maanate hai
 The concept has its origins in essays on the political economy of Richard Cantillon's work Essai sur la Nature du Commerce en Général and jean-baptiste
 ek or aam taur par kaha jane vaala siddhant yah he ki maang hone par avasaron or logon kaa laabh lene kii sthiti ke sangyojan se udhyami jansankhya se ubharate hai
 An entrepreneur may assume that they are one of the few people who are able to identify or solve a problem
 ise dhyaan main rakhte hue, ek vyakti bhavi udhyamiyon ke vishay main ek tarafa jaankaree ke vitaran or duusari taraf kaise paryaavarniya kaarak samaaj dwaara udhyamiyon kii utpaadakta dar main badlaav laa sakate hai, kaa adhyayan karata he
 In this context, a leading thinker of the Austrian school is Joseph Schumpeter, who sees the entrepreneur as the father of innovators and who has popularized the phrase creative destruction for the role of entrepreneurs in changing business norms from his point of view

 Mesotherapy is an artificial aesthetic medicine performed without surgery
 is kriya ke tahat twachaa ke nichle maansal bhaag me injection ke dwaara kai tarah ke pharmasutical, paudhen se nikaalane vaali, or homeopathic davaayen di jaati hai
 Numerous published studies of these therapeutic treatments are also available, and the effects of this mixture of medicines on the body have been widely discussed in Europe and South America for many years
 is baat kaa koi thos pramaan nahi mila he ki ye davaayen vishesh rup se adipos ko target karatin hai
 Cell lysis caused by the detoxifying effect of dioxylic may be the reason for its clinical effect
 2012 me ek faansisi prayogshaala ne mesotherapi upachaar ke liye di jane vaali dawa ko taral podlate ke madhyam se dene kaa tarika khoj nikaala
 This podlet was put on the facial steam applying device and then the steam was released from the device to the pores of the face
 yah apane tarah kii pehali khoj thi jiske kaaran kaa upachaar logon ke unke gharon me hi pradaan kiya ja sakaa
 Michel Pistor first established the mode of mesotherapies after extensive clinical research
 1948 se 1952 ke madhya antartvachiya upachaar ke kshetra me antarrashtriya str par shodh ke athak prayaso ke baad pistor kii khoj ko maanviya mesotherapi chikitsa pranali ke rup me lagu karne me safalataa mili
 In 1987, the Académay de France Madécine of France recognized it as a distinct medical system
 yah dhyaan dene yogya tathy he ki haalaanki french samaaj me mesotherapico twachaa ke kai tarah ke vikaro kaa upachaar karne vaali vidha ke rup me manyata mil chuki he phir bhi ise kahin bhi plastic surgery ke tahat athwa uske vikalp ke rup me istemaal nahi kiya jaataa
 Despite this, mesotherapies are considered a successful medical system in many countries of Europe and South America and are used by about 18,000 physicians worldwide
 paanch dashakon se mesotherapi ke lagaataar prayog ke baad bhi kai saare chikitsak mesotherapi kii upyogita ko sandigdh hi maanate he or unka kahana he ki is upachaar pranali par kiye gayi adhyayan iske prabhaavon ke nirdhaaran ke liye paryaapt nahi he
 The primary problem here is that clinical experiments conducted about the usefulness of mesotherapies in the context of artificial aesthetic medicine are not considered "high quality"
 haalaanki is vidha ko kai saare dard nivarak upachaaron - khaas kar tendenitis, tendon kalicyficasan, danta chikitsa, arthritis or lyamfedema aadi main - ke rup me manyata mil chuki he
 Also, many case studies and clinical papers have also missed studying the ingredients used under mesotherapies in the case of artificial aesthetic medicine
 america ke plastic surgery chikitsakon ke sangh ne bhi mesotherapi ko manyata dene se inkaar kar rakhaa he
 But there is a controversy over their denial as there is no mesotherapeutic surgical system and in a way it is a challenge for users of plastic surgery due to its specialty of artificial aesthetic medicine without incision
