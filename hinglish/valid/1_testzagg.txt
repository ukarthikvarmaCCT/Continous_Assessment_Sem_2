 The skillful politician Nana Fadnavis came under the charge of conducting the maratha-union policy from 1774

 There was mutual hatred and bitterness among them, and there were sides and sub-parties, whose inspiration, many conspiracies, dislocations, betrayals, etc

 At the same time there were differences and mutual conspiracies regarding the succession of Peshwa

 Thus, while protecting his self-respect, Nana made Peshwa, and protected Maratharajya, and saved the Maratha Sangha from being alienated

 However the company never approved the conversion
 company is baat se avgat thi ki dharm, parmparik bhartiya samaaj main vidroh kaa ek kaaran ban saktaa he
 Earlier, one of the reasons for the decline of the Portuguese from India and Japan in the sixteenth century was that they had tried to force Christianity on the masses

 The officers of the company were empowered with a number of appeals against Indians in courts
 company bharatiyon par baari kar bhi lagaati thi jise na chukaane kii sthiti main unki sampatti adhigrahit kar lee jaati thi
 Modernization efforts of the company were viewed with suspicion in traditional Indian society
 logo ne mana ki railway jo bambai se sarvapratham chalaa ek daanav he or logo par vipatti laayegaa
 But many historians also believe that these reforms have been exaggerated because the company did not have the means to implement these reforms and their influence away from Calcutta was negligible
 1857 ke vidroh kaa ek pramukh kaaran company dwaara bharatiyon kaa aarthik shoshan bhi tha
 The policies of the company completely ended India's traditional economy

 The textile industry suffered the most

 In the 18th and 19th centuries, Indian exports came to an end due to import tax and many barriers in Britain and Europe

 In the beginning of British rule, the peasants were left at the mercy of the zamindars, who greatly increased the rent and started exploiting the peasants by forced labor and other methods
 company ne kheti ke sudhaar par bahut kam kharch kiya or adhiktar lagaan company ke kharchon ko puraa karne main prayog hota tha
 In the event of crop failure, the moneylenders loaned the farmers more interest and cheated the illiterate farmers in many ways
 britani kanoon vyavastha ke antargat bhoomi hastantaran vaid ho jane ke kaaran kisaanon ko apni bhoomi se bhi haath dhonaa padataa tha
 Due to these problems there was dissatisfaction among every section of the society
 san 1848 or 1856 ke bich lard dalhoji ne doctrin ouf laps ke kanoon ke antargat anek rajyon par adhikaar kar liya
 According to this theory, a state, territory or area of british influence will become subject to the company, if the king of the region dies without permission or the ruler is disqualified in the eyes of the company
 is siddhant par kaary karte hue lard dalhoji or uske uttaradhikari lard cannig ne satara,nagpur,jhansi,avadh ko company ke shashan main mila liya
 Political credibility of the company was also questioned due to the treaties and promises made by the company

 In the early years of the company, caste privileges and customs were given importance in the Bengal Army, but after 1840, after the coming of modern government in Calcutta, there was a fear of losing the caste among the soldiers
 sena main sipaahiyon ko jati or dharm se sambandhit chinh pahanane se manaa kar diya gaya

 The modern system of firing in the new gun was used, but the process of firing in the gun was old
 nayi enfield bandook bharne ke liye kaartoos ko daanton se kaat kar kholana padataa tha or usame bhare hue barud ko bandook kii nalee main bhar kar kaartoos ko daalana padataa tha
 The outer shell of the cartridge contained grease which protected it from water sealing
 sipaahiyon ke bich afawaah fail chuki thi ki kaartoos main lagi hui charbi suar or gaay ke maance se banaayi jaati he
 This was against the religious sentiments of both Hindu and Muslim soldiers
 British officials called it a rumor and suggested that soldiers make new cartridges in which goat or bee fat should be used
 is suzav ne sipaahiyon ke bich faili is afawaah ko or pukhta kar diya
 Another suggestion was that the soldier open the cartridge with his hands instead of cutting through the teeth
 parantu sipaahiyon ne ise ye kehete hue asvikaar kar diya ki ve kabhi bhi nayi kavayad ko bhul sakate hai or daanton se kaartoos ko kaat sakate hai
 The then British Army Chief George Enson, bypassing the advice of his officers, solved the problem arising out of this exercise and new gun

 Mangal Pandey told his comrades to openly rebel but when no one believed, he tried to take his life with his gun

 He thought and the next day he put his resignation on the table of Devdas ji and came in the organizer
 yah nirnay koi saral nahin tha
 Where did the journey of journalism through Hindustan Times and where the organiser lacked the Kantakarnakar route

 But he did not choose the path of fame and glory
 1948 se 1982 tak ve sangh-patrakarita ke stambh bane rahe
 At the time of his rebellion with the Organizer in 1982, he said in a very touching tone that i had come to the Organizer at the young age of 26 and am now 62 years old and am taking off from him
 unki lekhnee, unke adhyayan or unki kattar dhyeyvadita ke kaaran "argeniser' ko sangh ke aalochak bhi padhane ko majaboor the

 If it is said that Malkani and the organizer have played an effective role in building the image of the Sangh, then there will be no exaggeration
 12 july 1949 ko sangh par se pratibandh uthne ke pashchaat jab sangh ke bheetar bhavi kaaryniti ke bare main vichaar manthan chalaa to usamen malkani ji ne nirnaayak bhoomika nibhaai
 Dadrao Parmarth, Balraj Madhok and Malkani himself, the exclusive collaborators of Dr
 Hedgewar and the first campaigner of the Sangh in the Organizer, published an article titled "kamal"
 unka aagrah tha ki ab sangh ko apni ekaantik sanghathan sadhana se aage badhkar raajnneeti ke madhyam se swadhin bharat kii punarrachana ke yajna main yogadan karnaa chahie
 Organizers tended to think of a large section of Sangh activists in this direction, or rather gave expression to their feelings
 yah bade saahas kaa kaam tha, kyonki malkani ji yah jaanate the ki sarasanghachaalak shri golwalkar ko raajnneeti se puri tarah vitrushna thi
 Malkani ji became the ideologue of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh since its birth
 angreji ke lekhan kaa sab boj un par hi padataa tha
 On his own request, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay started writing weekly "political Diary" in Organizer, some part of which has been published in book form
 main dilli 1964 main ek kalege main lekturer hokar aayaa
 Hence, the association with Malkani started
 ek din achaanak unhone phone karke milane ko kaha
 By then the organizer had reached a clean central place like the Marina Hotel at Connaught Place
 yah nishchay hi malkani ji ke aagrah kaa fal tha
 When i went, he told that the decision has been taken to bring Hindi weekly Panchajanya to Delhi and Atal ji has asked to hand over the edits to him
 main swayan hindi na pard saktaa hum, na likh saktaa hum par main tumhen puraa-puraa sahyog duungaa
 Now you come here every day

 Malkani used to be very restrained in his daily routine for doing so hard labor
 akaaran gapp lagane kii unhen aadat nahin thi
 Only giving the time to the attendant to talk about work, no one could talk at length without his wish

 He took great care of the dignity of the post of editor

 At the time, the present Governor of Goa, Shri Kedarnath Sahni was working on the post of Managing Director of Bharat Prakashan
 malkani ji or ve donon ghanishtha mitra the sangh or jansangh ke rishte se
 But after coming to office, Sahni used to remain the managing director only for him and then the dignity of the editorial position in his relationship became prominent

 In 1971, a daily paper called "motherland" started in English
 uske sampadan kaa hi nahin, uski vyavastha kaa bhi bhaar malkani ji par hi aa padaa
 Although initially the outgoing editor of the Times of India, D
R
 Manekkar's name was known as editor but the real burden of editing was on Malkani ji

 The story of his prison life came out of his pen in the form of a book called "midnight Nauk"

 Malkani ji returned to the position of Editor of Organizer again and in 1982, at the age of 62, Organizer Editor retired from his duties
 par ve thake nahin the, sanyamit aahaar-vihaar ke kaaran unka sharir puri tarah hrisht-pusht tha
 He had close contact with Muslim leaders in prison life
 unhone bharat ke itihaas ke apane adhyayan ko or vyapak va gaharaa kiya
 Now his concern was how to bring the huge Muslim society into the national stream
 uske saath samvaad ke pul kaise banaae jaaen
 The pain of partition was deep in his mind, the dream of Akhand Bharat was in his eyes
 sindh se unka sampark bana hua tha

 Therefore, the tone of Malkaniji from 1948 to 1975 on the Muslim question was now changing slightly

 In Delhi, he set up the stage to organize Sindhi society and became its first president
 1982 main argeniser se malkani ji kaa parthaky bahut saamaanya nahin tha, kuch galatchhemiyaan utpann huir thim
 Malkani ji was deeply hurt inside

 Swami Nigamanand Paramahamsa was a great monk from India and Sadguru
 unke shishy logan unhen adarpurvak shri shri thakur bulaate hai
 It is believed that Swami Nigamananda had attained perfection in tantra, knowledge, yoga and love like Chaturvidhi Sadhana, as well as the experience of nirvikalpa samadhi like difficult samadhi
 unke in sadhana anubhuti se be paanch prasidh granth yatha brahmacharya saadhan, yogiguru, gyaniguru, tantricguru or premicguru bangala bhashaa main pranayan kiye the
 He had established Asam Bangiya Saraswat Math Jorhat district and Neelachal Saraswat Sangh in the entire district which is still doing its work
 unhone saare sadhana maatr tin saal main samaapt kar liya tha or paramhans shrimad swami nigamanand saraswati dev ke naam se vikhyath hue
 Swami Nigamananda was born into a Brahmin family in Qutabpur in the then Nadia district
 unke bachapan kaa naam nalinikant tha
 His father Bhuban Mohan Bhattacharya was well known by the name of a simple spiritual person
 bachapan main hi unki maa, maaniky sundari, kaa swargbaas hua tha
 At the age of seventeen years, Nalinikanth got married with Sudhanshubala, the eldest daughter of Halisahar Nibsi late Baidyanath Mukhopadhyay, eleven years old
 is bich nalinikant ne sarbhe skool kaa pathakram puraa karke obarsiar kii naukari kii
 After that he started a job in Narayanpur under Dinajpur Zamidari
 ek din sam ko narayanpur kachhari main karyrat rahete samay sudhadevi kii chhayamurti dekhakar bah chaunk uthe
 After a while, the statue disappeared
 baad main gamb pahanch kar pataa chalaa ki sudhadevi is sansar main nahi raheen
 This incident instilled confidence in him that he has a close relationship with death
 is mrityu or paralog tatva ko jaanane keliye unhone madras sthit thiosphy sampradaay main shaamil ho kar bah bidya sikhi
 Bah Dibangat wanted to see Sudhanshubala directly
 isliye medium ke bheetar unki aatma ko laakar aatma ke pratyaksh darshan naa honese nalinikant trupt nahin ho paye
 While practicing, he came to know that by the grace of Hindu yogis, he will gain direct knowledge
 isliye nalinikant madras se lautakar hindooyogiyon kii khoj main lag gayi
 One day Nalinikanth saw at night, an astrological great man standing near his bed saying - "bats! Take this mantra of yours"
 itnaa kahkar unhone nalinikant ko bilvapatr par likhit ekakhyar mantra pradaan kiya or uske baad palabar main hi gaayab ho gayi
 After that Nalinikanth searched a lot, yet no one could convince him the secret of that mantra
 us samay bahut hi nirutchyhit hokar nalinikant ne aatm hatya karne kaa sankalp kiya or uske baad bah neend main so gayi
 Then an old Brahmin said in a dream, son, your guru is Bamapaksha of Tarapith
 ek din raat ko nalinikant ne dekha, unki shayya ke paas ek jyotirmaya mahapurush khadey hokar kah rahe hen - bats ! apana yah mantra grahan karo
 Having said this, he gave Nalinikanth a monolithic mantra written on the bilvapatra and then disappeared within a moment
 uske baad nalinikant kaaphi khoj kii, phir bhi koi bhi unhen us mantra kaa rahasy nahin samajha paaya
 At that time, Nirinikanth resolved to commit self-murder after being very discriminated and then went to sleep
 tatpashyaat ek bruddh brahaman ne swapn main kaha, betaa, tumhaare guru tarapith ke bamakhepa hen
 Nalinikanth reached Sadhu Bamaksha at Tarapith in Birbhum district
 siddh mahatma bamakshepa ne unhen mantra kii saadhan pranali sikhaane kaa bachan diya
 By his grace Nalinikanth saw Debi Tara in the Sudhansubala statue and interacted with the goddess
 devi ke baar baar darshan paakar bhi nalinikant unhen sparsh karne main asamarth rahe
 In order to know its essence, saints started searching for the guru according to the teachings of Bahi Tantrikuru Bamakshapa
 guru kii khoj karte karte unhone bharat ke anek sthanon kaa bhraman kiya or ant main pushkar tirth main swami sachchidanand saraswati ke darshan paakar bah unke charnashrith hue | sachchidanand ke darshan karte hi nalinikant jaan paye kii jin mahatma ne unhen swapn main mantra daan kiya tha, be hi yahi sachchidanand swami he
 Stayed with Nalinikanth Guru and did many painstaking tasks under his command
 unki seva se santust hokar gurudev ne unhen sanyas kii deekshya de kar unka naam nigamanand rakhaa
 After retirement, for the achievement of the element, he did the Chardham Bhraman on the orders of the Guru
 parantu jis tatv kii unhone uplabdhi kii, us tatv kii antar main uplabdhi ke liye be gyani guru ke aadesh se unase vidaa le kar yogi guru kii khoj main nikal pade
 At the time of the search of Yogi Guru, one day he was so enthralled after seeing the delightful view of the banas that even after the end of the day, he could not know that it was evening
 faltah unhane basti main na lautakar ek ped ke kotor main raat bitaai | raat biit jane kaa baad paribrajak nigamanand ne ped ke neeche ek dirghakaay tejasbi sadhu ke darshan kiye or unke ishaare par unka anusaran kiya
 Later, that monk introduced himself to Nigamananda and gave him the opportunity to give him a yoga creed and placed him in his hut
 us sadhu ke ashram main rahakar swami nigamanand ne yogasaadhan ke kaushal siikhe or unke aadesh se bah yoga sadhana ke liy lokalay main laute
 The name of his yoga teacher is Gusninacharya Sumerudas Maharaj
 nigamanand hath yoga kii sadhana ke liye paavna jila ke haripur gaanv main rahane lage
 Nigamananda went to Kamakhya due to the birth of many birds in meditation and attained samvikalpa samadhi first
 uske baad kamakhya pahaad main nirvikalp samadhi praapt kii
 It is believed that i am a Guru in Nigmanand Nirvikalpa Samadhi, immersed in it - i came back again with this form of knowledge
 lekhak durga charan mahanti ne likhaa "main koun hoon" yah jaanane keliye swami nigamanand sansar ko tyaag kar bairangi bane the or "main guru hoon", yah bhav lekar vah sansar main laut aaye
 Purnamjant, taking this pride, Nigamananda arrived in Kashi
 bahaa par maan arnpurnna ne unke bheetar apurnataa-bodh kaa jaagran kar diya or kaha, tumne brahamagyaan praapt kiya he sahi, parantu abar brahamagyaan, yaa prem-bhakthi ke path main jo bhagabat gyaan he, tumhen prapti nahin hui
 Therefore you are not complete
 tatpachaat shri nigamanand dev prem shiddha gauridevi kii krupa se abar braham gyaan praapt kar charam siddhi main pahunche
 After Prem Siddhi, Tara, the favored goddess of Swami Nigamananda Dev, gave him a darshan and asked him to be a universal master; Jagat stale is your child
 tum localay main jaakar apane shishy bhakt ko swarup gyaan do
 Nigamananda considered himself complete with the balance of Taradevi
 is bich bah gurudev ko darshan ke liye kumbh meley main pahunche
 There, he first of all paid obeisance to Jagadguru Shankaracharya after bowing to his Guru Sachchidananda Dev
 dusre sadhuone us par aapati jataai
 Swami Nigamananda satisfied Jagadguru by giving him the right answer
 jab unhone jagadguru shankaracharya ke kuch suchintit prashnon ke sahi uttar diye, to jagadguru ne unke guru sachchidanand ko nirdesh diya kii unhen paramhans kii oopaadhi se alankrita karen
 Guru Sachchidananda Dev gave the title of Paramhansa to Swami Nigamananda with full devotion to Sadhumandali
 unka puraa naam isi prakaar se rahaa paribrajakacharya paramhans shri mad swami nigamanand saraswati dev
 In order to change the mood of the Desh Basis and to return them from the trend to the path of retirement, Shri Nigmanand propounded the texts like Yogi Guru, Jnani Guru, Brahmacharya Means, Tantric Guru and Premic Guru etc
 and monthly as Arya Darpan as the mouthpiece of Sanatan Dharma
 Published the magazine

 Through the Sangh and the conference, their aim was to serve the ideal people, by creating the ideal household community, by establishing the reputation and spirit of the Sangh power
 narayan ke gyaan se jiv seva karne kaa upadesh dekar shri nigamanand ne shishy-bhakton or jansadharan ko udabuddha kiya
 Thus, within a very short span of time, he left the Assam-based monastery after extensive propagation of the Upani Bhavadhara in Bengal, Bihar, Assam, and some areas of Brahmadesh and spent the remainder of his life in a deserted bass in Puridham
 unhone odisha ke bhakton ko sanghabaddh karne ke uddeshy main upane shubh janmdin saal 1934 kii shravan poornima ko nilachal saraswat sangh kii stapana karke upani aadhyatmik bhavadhaara kaa prachaar karne kaa nirdesh diya
 Along with establishing the ideal householder to live the Sangh Shakti, he preached to the disciple devotees to exchange emotions

 The English word "charter" derives from the Latin "charta", which means 'paper or something written on it'
 rajlekh kaa yah aadhunik rup hua
 But when the paper was not invented, the epigraphy used to come out
 bhojaptr, taalptr, tamrapatr, reshmi vastra aadi kaagaj ke hi bhinn bhinn rup the
 Inscriptions of emperors are typical examples of epigraphy
 samraat ashok ke shilaalekh ab bhi vartmaan hai
 The epigraph has two areas - one private, the other public
 nijee kshetra arthath privet lau main iskaa paryaay dastavej he evam kisi bhi aupchaarik lekh ke prasang main iskaa vyavhaar kiya ja saktaa he
 In private law, it is most commonly used in the purchase and sale of land
 vikrata khariddaar ko jo dastavej likhata he, usase kharidaar ko haq miltaa he evam raja yaa rajya kaa koi adhikari dastavej par apana hastakshar kaa evam sarkari muhar lagaakar ise manyata detaa he
 This is an illustration of the epigraph itself, although its use in India or England is no longer prevalent in the context of a written document
 kintu france main iskaa prayog ab bhi kiya jaataa he
 The epigraph in the public sphere, ie in public law, is the order by which a king declares the protection of the right of his subjects or a sovereign state confers authority on his colony
 rajlekh kaa prayog bank yaa anyaanya company ke prasang main bhi hota he
 In this sense, the epigraph is the document by which the state grants rights or privileges to a Jamaat of elected people for a particular goal
 13veen sadi ke aarambh main england ke raja jon ne apana ekadhikaar sthapit karnaa chaha
 His feudatories revolted against him seeing his rights abducted
 nidaan jon ko ek vishisht likhit ghoshnaa ke dwaara unke adhikaar kii raksha kaa vachan dena padaa
 This manifesto is popularly known as Magnacarta
 iske baad is shabd kaa prayog vaidhanik visheshadhikaar ke liye hone laga
 In the present era the epigraph is used in the context of the legislation provided by the state
 madhya yug main raja ke atirikt uske anuchar samant log bhi vyakti vishesh ko visheshadhikaar dete the
 Girja's mind also used to do this
 nagarpalika evam gild aadi saarvajanik sansthaaon ne bhi apane "nagar kii swatantrata" maanya netaaon ko unki saarvajanik sevaaon ke liye pradaan karne kaa prachlan kiya
 In the present day, this tradition has often ended; However, in England, the state still offers public institutions in this form
 vartmaan yug main rajlekh kaa ek pramukh drushtaant rajpatrit company he
 Such a company can be called a corporation
 iske apane saamaanya adhikaar evam visheshadhikaar hote hai
 Certain conditions described in the Special Gazette provided by the supreme authority of the State keep the rights, privileges, different conditions and areas in which the company can use them or are bound to follow the prescribed rules
 is prakaar kii company kaa aitihaasik udgam rajashrith hone ke kaaran praapt honevaale laabhon se sambhddha he
 Sufficient funds are required to set up a large company
 koi vyakti swayan utani adhik rakam nahin laga saktaa
 Therefore, he has to go to other people for this
 bahudhaa use saadhaaran janata se karj lenaa padataa he
 If the company is Rajnumodu, then people automatically have confidence in it and have no difficulty in moving towards their goal
 vartmaan yug main is prakaar kii company rajsamposhit rup main dekhi jaati he
 In a company the government is a partner, then it gives a loan to someone
 bhatak evam rajlekh sarvatha ek duusare se bhinn hai
 Bhatak is a special type of contract whereby two or more parties mutually agree to carry goods by ship from one place to another in a certain period of time by sea
 jahaaj kaa puraa haada yaa to yatra aarambh hone ke pehle ek mushth de diya jaataa he athwa sanvida kii sharton ke anusaar yatra ke dauraan yatra ke bhinn bhinn charnon kii samaapti par diya jaataa he
 Illegal trade is outside the domain of rent
 kanoon kii prakalpana he ki maal dhone ke nimitt prastut jahaaj samudrayatra ke liye upyukt ho, bhale hi yatra aarambh hone ke pashchaat isamen aakshamata kyon na aa jaae
 If there are several stages of the journey, it is necessary to have the ship suitable at the beginning of each journey
 yadi kisi apratyaashit ghatana, yatha yuddh, ke kaaran bhatak kaa kriyanvayan na ho sake to nyaayalay prasangadhin sanvida kii samaapti ghoshit karegaa
 If the rent is organized for any illegal purpose, then the said contract will not be considered to exist from the beginning
 rajlekh praapt kar hi vyapaaree madhyayug main bahudhaa samudramaarg se maal le jate the
 Probably for this reason, there is a close relationship between "bhatak" and "rajlekh"

 In electronics, the vacuum tube is a device whose function is based on the flow of electric current in the vacuum
 ise electron nalee, tapayanic volve yaa keval 'tub' yaa 'volve' bhi kehete hai
 In these, the electrons emanating from a heated filament accelerate in vacuum to reach the anode which is placed at higher voltages than the cathode
 nirvaat naliyon ke pradurbhaav ne electronic ke janm or vikaas main mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaai
 The first thermogenic tube was built by Fleming in 1904, which is called bipolar
 jaisaa pehle hi likhaa ja chukaa he, dwidhruvi main do dhruv hote hai
 One pole discharges the electron and the other is placed at the money potential instead of the first pole, then the electric current flows
 parantu yah dhara ekadish hoti he
 If the plaque is placed at the money potential rather than the minus, then as mentioned above, the electron current flows
 parantu yadi vibhav ko duusari disha main lagaaya jaae, arthath yadi pattica runagra kii apeksha rin vibhav par ho, to electron dhara ekadam nahin pravaahit hogi, kyonki bina pattica ko garam kiye pattica se electron nahin niklenge
 For this reason the electron current in the tube can only flow in one direction
 yadi prayavarti dhara ke strot ko ek dwidhruvi ore vidyutiya bhaar ke, jaise kisi pratirohak ke, shreneesmbandh ke aar paar lagaaya jaay to dhara keval ek hi dish main bahegi or prayavarti ke aadhe chakra main koi dhara nahin pravaahit hogi
 In these directions, the hose allows the current to run in only one direction under load instead of alternating current
 pehle pattic dhara dhire-dhire badhati he, phir kuch shighrata se or ant main sthir ho jaati he, jise santrupt dhara kehete hai
 This saturation occurs due to the transfer charge, which is revealed near the minuscule due to stray electrons
 dwidhruvi main pattic dhara nimnlikhit sameekaran dwaara pradarshit kii ja sakati he: Ip = plaque current in bipolar; k = vah niyatank jo nalee kii jyamiti par nirbhar rahata he; v = plaque voltage of bipolar jaisaa upar bataaya ja chukaa he, dwidhruvi main vidyuddhara keval ek hi disha main pravaahit hoti he
 For this reason this tube is used in alternation of alternating current
 isamen prayavarti dhara disht dhara main parivartit ho jaati he
 This is called 'half wave desorption'
 un dwidhruviyon ko, jo ucch vibhavapratyavarti dhara ke rujukaran main prayukt hote hai, kenatron kehete hai
 a gassed bipolar is used for powerful current compensation, for example the tanger resistor is a gassed resistor for induction of accumulator batteries
 liben ne germany main or lee da forest ne america main ek mahatvapurn khoj kii
 He placed an additional pole between the two poles of the bipolar and found that this type of tube, called the tripolar, is very beneficial
 is tritiy dhruv kii anupasthiti main, jaisaa pehle bataaya ja chukaa he, nalee main tapayanic dhara tabhi pravaahit hoti he jab dhanagar runagra kii apeksha dhan vibhav par hota he
 This is called plaque current
 yah pattic voltata ke saath saath tab tak badhati he jab tak antaran aavesh prakat nahin hota
 It becomes stable when it appears, that is, the filler current does not increase with the increase of the band voltage
 jab tisare dhruv ko nalee ke do dhruvon ke bich main laga diya jaataa he to vah is antaran aavesh kaa niyantran karne lag jaataa he
 For this reason, the grid can be called transfer-charge-controller
 yadi grid vibhav runagra vibhav se kam rahata he to grid electranon ko peeche kii ore phenk detii he or pattic dhara kam ho jaati he
 If the grid potential is greater than the negative potential then the filler current increases
 phir, pattic dhara main grid dhara athwa grid voltata ke saath kaa parivartan ek anya laabhakaari gun he
 a slight change in grid current or grid voltage can bring substantial changes in the band current
 is yukti kaa upyog pravardhakon main karte hai
 The platonic current depends on three independent variables
 ve hai pattic voltata, grid voltata tathaa runagra ko garam karne ke liye prayukt voltata
 When the heat voltage is increased so much that enough emissions begin to occur, the current is controlled only by the transfer charge
 tab pattic voltata keval do swatantra charon kaa falan rah jaati he
 They are plate voltage and grid voltage
 is falan ko ek samtal main kisi vakr se pradarshit nahin kar sakate
 It can be displayed only in a tri-dimensional surface
 yadhyapi isprakaar kii vakr rekha se vishesh soochna praapt kii ja sakati he, to bhi isko pradarshit karne main bahut asuvidha he
 For this reason, it is represented by three types of curved lines, called static symbols
 k) hai
 As mentioned, the main use of trident is in amplifiers
 iskaa prayog dolak, rujukari, parichaayak tathaa murchak ke roopon main bhi kiya jaataa he
 The use of a tri-dipole in high frequency-amplification-action results in the loss of both circuits due to the dipole capacitor between the fillet and the grid
 is kaaran ucch aavriti par tridhruvi kaa kaary asthir ho jaataa he
 This coupling causes the valve to oscillate, causing dissonant sound
 is vighnkaaree ansh ko chaturdhruvi main dhanagar or grid ke bich main ek or grid lagaakar dur kiya jaataa he
 We put this grid on the money potential
 yah vibhav pattic ke vibhav se kam hota he
 In the presence of this grid, the positive circuit and grid circuit are not coupled and oscillations do not occur
 is grid ko aavaran grid kehete hai
 The presence of a casing grid has another advantage
 tridhruvi kii apeksha dhanagar electron bahaav ke niyatrann main kam suchetan hota he, kyonki aavaran grid dhanagar kii apeksha runagra ke adhik paas hone ke kaaran adhik prabhaavshaalee hota he
 This increases amplification
 chaturdhruvi main tridhuvi ke samaan hi niyantran grid or runagra sthapit hote hai
 Therefore, grid-plaque conductivity in both tubes is usually the same but in quadrupolar plaque resistance is sufficiently higher than that of triploid
 iskaa kaaran, jaisaa upar likhaa ja chukaa he, pattic voltata par pattic dhara kaa nunatam prabhaav he
 There is a drawback in the use of quadriplegia
 yah he pattic kaa gaun utsarjan
 When very fast thermogenic electrons collide with the band, secondary emission occurs from the band
 pattic se gaun electranon ke utsarjan dwaara or unke aavaran kii ore aakarshith ho jane ke kaaran dhanagar lakshanik main ek anthan aa jaati he
 This spasm leads to distortion and instability in the tube
 isko dur karne ke liye ek tritiy grid, aavaran grid tathaa dhanagar ke bich main, laga dete hai
 This grid is called the oppressive grid and this tube, which consists of five poles, is called Panchdhruvi
 damankaaree grid runagra se praaia: ant:sambandhit rahata he
 Its function is to suppress secondary emission electrons
 mukhya electron dhara par damankaaree grid kii upasthiti kaa koi vishesh prabhaav nahin padataa
 It only blocks secondary emissions
 panchadhruvi kaa upyog adhiktar ucch aavriti par vikrutirahit pravardhan main hota he
 This tube has often displaced the use of quadruplets in radio-frequency-voltage-amplifiers
 iskaa kaaran yah he ki panchadhruvi ke upyog se madhyam-pattic-vibhav par ucch vibhavapravardhan hota he
 In panchipolar and quadrupolar sometimes controllers do not make the grid the same with a specific intent
 donon siron par grid taron ke antaraal ko kam kar dete hai
 This type of tube acts as a parallel group of many tubes and these tubes have different amplification factors
 jaise hi grid voltata ko rinatmak kar dete hai, vaise hi grid ke ucch pravardhangunan-khand ke bhaag cat jate hai or unamem electron dhara nahin wahit hoti, kintu anya bhaagon par koi prabhaav nahin padataa
 If the grid is negative, the electric current can also flow from this part
 isliye electron dhara praaia: sthir rahati he or pravardhan gunan khand main parivartan hota rahata he
 This type of tube is called variable-tube
 iskaa upyog adhiktar swat: chaalit udghoshtaniyantrak ke paripathon main hota he
 After making quadruple and panchipolar, it was realized that the transfer charge between the casing grid and the band can be used as a secondary emission resistor
 pujanshakti nalee main antaran aavesh kaa upyog isiilie karte hai
 The stars of the helical controller grid and the cover grid are kept the same and their wires are arranged such that the electrons are assembled into a cylindrical surface between the fillet and the cover grid
 is kaaran yah belanaakaar sataha runagra ke vibhav par hoti he or pattic se utsarjit electranon ko peeche kii ore phenk detii he
 Thus it succeeds in preventing secondary emissions
 kabhi kabhi kuch vishesh punjashkti naliyon main ek ore damankaaree grid laga dete hai, parantu atanran aavesh dwaara banaai gai belanaakaar sataha gaun utsarjan ko rokane main vishesh prabhaavshaalee hoti he
 The filament of the masseter tube is characteristic in that it turns more sharply
 is kaaran punjashkti nalee ek panchadhruvi se uttam he

 saathottaree hindi sahitya hindi sahitya ke itihaas ke antargat san 1960 i0 ke baad mukhyatah navlekhan yug se kaaphi had tak bhinnata kii pratiti karaane vaali aisi peedi ke dwaara rachit sahitya he jinamein vidroh evam araajaktaa kaa swar pradhan tha
 However, along with it, the parallel stream of spontaneity and democratic consciousness was also prevalent in the field of literature, which later became dominant
 saathottaree lekhan main vidrohi chetanayukta aandolan praathmik rup se kavita ke kshetra main mukhar hui
 Therefore, all the movements related to it were mainly poetry movements
 haalaanki kahani evam anya vidhaon par bhi iskaa asar paryaapt rup se padaa or kahani ke kshetra main bhi 'akahani' jaise aandolan ne rup dhaaran kiya
 Around sixty, the stream of new poetry began to look somewhat different from itself
 saath ke baad jo nayaa mode lakshith hota he vah ekaek deekhne vaali koi naveen vastu nahin, varan nayi kavita se hi phuta hua he
 The tone of discontent, disapproval and rebellion has emerged very clearly in the later sixties
 nayi kavita main bhi asantosh or asweekruti kaa swar vidyaman he, kintu saath ke baad is swar ne or tikhe vyangy or vidroh kaa rup dhaaran kar liya he, jivan kii tuutati murtiyon ke bahut kareeb jaakar unki tuutane kii talkhi, vyathaa or usamen se footati asweekruti kii ugrata ko pahachaanaa he
 The greatest feature of the new poem is that it conveyed authentic experiences of the whole life in their living environment
 vishay yaa anubhuti ke abhijatya or bhinn-bhinn drushtiyon yaa vaadon se bane hue unke gheron ko todakar vyakti dwaara bhoge jate hue jivan ke har chote-bade satya ko pratikon or bimbon ke madhyam se ubhaarne main hi usne kavita kii sarthakata samajhi
 But overall, despite the pain in the poets of the new poem, there remained a positive hope for future creation
 swatantryottar bharat kii tatkaaleen paristhitiyon ke kaaran unamem hataasha or tuutan kaa bhav kaaphi tha parantu sapane puure hone kii ek ksheen aashaa bhi bachi rahi thi
 Disillusionment or disillusionment did not occur as a whole, so the new poem has a sense of torture, a tone of disapproval, but not a revolt
 dhire-dhire 'ilugen' ek dam tut gayi, mohabhang ho gaya
 The social environment of the person started to look more ugly, dreams of the future were broken
 dow0 bachchan singh ke shabdon main kaviyon ke ugaae hue suraj main roshni nahin aayi-- surya kaa swaagat vyarth chalaa gaya
 Many litterateurs began to see only two ways that either they would express the intense feeling of pain by adding tone to the head of the new poem, or all these circumstances would make their sensitive mind emerge from the midst of torture and torture
 Everything started to inspire rejection
 sahitya main ye donon dharaayen raheen, parantu san saath ke turat baad vidrohi dhara pradhan rahi jinamein se adhikansh nirlakshya yaa yon-vikrutilakshi thim
 By being objective, these poems were conveniently revolting, that is, where there was a danger in rebellion, there was rebellion where there was convenience
 saathottaree hindi sahitya kaa pehla dashak aadhuniktawaad se vishesh prabhavit he
 It is important to note that there is a difference between modern and modernity
 'aadhunik' 'madhyakaalin' se alag hone kii soochna detaa he
 'modern' is the result of scientific inventions and industrialization while 'modernism' is the result of excesses of industrialization, metropolitan monotony, the catastrophe of two great wars
 dow0 bachchan singh ke anusaar "vastutah naveen gyaan-vigyaan, technology ke falswaroop utpann visham maanviya sthitiyon ke naye, gaiyr-romentic or amithkeey saakshaatkaar kaa naam 'aadhuniktaa' he
 " aadhuniktaavaadi sahitya ek vishesh prakaar kaa sahitya he
 It rejects established culture, values and sensibilities
 yah duniya kii manyataon ko manjuur nahin karti, parampara ko bedi ke rup main leti he
 The modernist undertakes interludes, mocking the values, he is a rebel
 bheed kaa virodh karata he, vah vyakti kii mukti kaa vishwasi he
 He finds himself in a non-human condition, and expels affection, gratitude etc
 sanyam kii kami, prayog, sahitya roopon kii tod-phod, shock dene kii manovriti, aakrosh-kshobh-hinsa kii aakanksha aadi isaki visheshtaayen yaa 'motiff' hai
 Among the many trends that have been active in the poetry field, experiencing the isolation from the new poem, the most notable is Ginsberg, Rajkamal Chaudhary emerging in Hindi parallel to American Beatnik and hungry poets like Malay Raychaudhuri and Subimal Basak of Bengal influenced by them
 Some other poets related to poetry and rejected poetry who wrote about 'hetero sexuality' and 'open secrecy'
 Specific assumptions made by adopting an attempt to your 'disfiliatt' society
 unki kavita main yon shabdaawalee kaa nanga prayog, apane vikshobh or aakrosh ko vyakt karne ke liye praayah ek sanskarahinta evam vikruti ke rup main miltaa he
 Rajkamal Chaudhary has been considered the leading poet of this decade
 raajakmal choudhary main aadhuniktaa apni samagrata main dikhaai padati he
 Chaudhary's imprint can be seen on most of the compositions of this time
 bitanic aandolan hindi main ek fishan kii tarah aayaa or kuch hi samay main nishprerak ho gaya kyonki uski jaden desh ke yatharth main nahin thim
 Actually he was a poet of anger
 apni aakroshpurna vaani main ye apana gussa utaarte rahe
 He continued to express his screams, wounds and sexual innuendo in poetry, rejecting all the previous values and traditions
 parantu, yuyutsavadi, nav pragatisheel yaa nav pragativaadee kaviyon ne saamaajik mulyon par bal dete hue in bitanicon se apni asahmati vyakt kii
 After the new poem, so many slogans were heard in a short period in the field of Hindi poetry, so many movements came that no other literature of the world had such a lot of slogans and movements in such a short period
 inamen se kuch andolan or naare to samay kii gard main hi dab gayi kintu kuch vikaas ke path par bade bhi
 In fact, the nutritious compositions of these movements were also similar to each other and sometimes the same poet followed many movements
 sahitya-rachana kaa yah samay andolanon kii arajak baadh kaa samay rahaa
 The names of these movements are mainly poem-oriented
 is dashak main baadh kii tarah aaye kavita-andolanon main vyavastha-virdohi andolanon ke saath-saath vyavastha-samarthak kai andolan bhi the; parantu praayah in sabhi andolanon main suvyavasthit chintan kaa abhaav tha, jiske kaaran praayah ye sabhi laghujivi siddh hue
 The general introduction of both these types of main movements is visible in the following headings
 march 1962 ke 'bharti' ke ank main srivirendrakumar jain ne 'sanathan suryodayi' nayi kavita kii ghoshnaa kii
 Expressing his intentions, he said that "we are wandering in the shadowless direction of fall-defeat, frustration, complacency and living suicides, in the face of the destitute poetic consciousness
 Carrying in, taking in nectar from death and taking away the leel of limitless in the border - the imperative Sanatan Suryodayi Nutan Kavita stream of tomorrow to come free We do
 " is prakaar is andolan kaa mukhya swar vyavastha kaa hi tha, parantu lagbhag 3 saal baad hi 'bharti' ke hi farvari 1965 i0 ke ank main 'sanathan suryodayi kavita' ke sthaan par 'nutan kavita' kaa swar sunai dene laga
 Former supporters of 'sanatan Suryodayi Kavita' like Gangaprasad Vimal joined themselves in the 'akavita' category
 yuyutsavadi kavita kaa sambandh 'yuyutsa' naamak patrika se rahaa he
 Shalabh Sriram Singh was the originator of the Yutaswadi poetry
 unki manyata rahi he ki aadim yuyutsa hi sahityasarjan kii mul prerana he
 He says that "I accept the same primitive youth as the original inspiration for literature, which has been at the core of every revolution, change or dissolution somewhere
 vah yuyutsa jijeevishaavaadi, mumurshavadi, vidrohatmak athwa platonic kuch bhi ho sakati he
 "in 'roopambra' of April 1965, under the 'commencement', this quote of Shalabh Sriram Singh was given by the Swadesh Indians while declaring 'yuyotsa is the only cause of all'"
 'roopambara' ke hi agast 1966 ke 'adhunathan kavita ank' main 'yuyutsavadi navlekhan pradhan sahakaari prayaas' ke rup main saamne aayaa, teen kaviyon ke vaktavy sahit
 The editor also raised the issue of new sensibilities
 vimal pandeya, rameshwaradutt maanav, om prabhakar, bajrang bishnoi aadi ne bhi apane aap ko is andolan se sambandhit kiya
 Vimal Pandey tried to associate 'yuyotsavada' with 'angry Young Man'
 shri om prabhakar ne 'yuddhechha' ko sanathan vritti maanate hue yuyutsa ko jijeevishaa kaa paryaay mana he
 Bajrang Bishnoi has linked the question of commitment to Yuyutsa
 'utkarsh' patrika ke july '66 ke ank main shriram shukla ne 'asweekrut kavita' kaa naaraa buland kiya or 'ek lambii asweekrut kavita' 'mari hui aurat ke saath sambhog' sheershak se prastut kii
 For Shukla ji, the experience of sexual intercourse is enough - to carry seven epics
 ' asweekrut kavita ke pravaktaa kavi kii manyata he-- "satya ko satya na kah paane kii vishmata kabhi na kabhi avrodh todakar bah nikalati he or tabhi janm hota he asweekrut kavita kaa
 "and" is a communicative poem of specific tendencies, emotions, situations, values, inconsistencies and moods, disproved in the present era, but also rejected
 " asweekrut kavita yon vikrutiyon kii kavita he
 The use of vulgar words is readily accepted for them and according to them they are anxious to 'change disliked arrangements'
 hal na prastut kar sake to bhi 'un par prashn chihn lagaakar besudh logon kaa dhyaan aakarshith karnaa' ye apana kartavya samajhate hai
 Dr
 Shyam Parmar, the narrator of 'akvita', has been considered, but Jagdish Chaturvedi was also an equal partner with him and was among the early proponents of 'akvita'
 vastutah 'akavita' patrika ke teen sampadak the-- jagadish chaturvedi, shyaam parmaar or rabindranath tyaagi
 Theoretical articles in support of Akvita were often not published in 'akvita' magazine
 un logon kii manyata thi kii 'baat bolegi ham nahin'
 However, Dr
 Shyam Parmar also wrote a book titled 'akvita and art-references' in support of Akvita, which attempted to define multiple verses
 jagadish chaturvedi is varg ke kaviyon ke dwaara bauddhik str par jeeye gayi jivan kii ekangita, visangati tathaa kachot ko sapraan abhivyakti pradaan karne kii sachetanta ke kaaran tathaa kavy kii puraatan parampara se pruthakta ke kaaran is kavy ko 'abhinav kavy' kii sangya dete hue kehete hai ki "unhen 'anti-kavy' ke saarth-vaahakon ke rup main pariganit kiya ja saktaa he
 "but Shyam Param does not consider Paramar Akvita as anti-poetry or anti-poetry
 ve akavita ko 'antarvirodhon kii anveshak kavita' maanate hai
 According to him, the specialty of this poetry movement is in the fact that "the tendencies of poets are associated with different mindsets"
 " "akavita kaldharmee kavita he
 It will be a limited-time poem, as it will not have to hoist flags in the future
 " tathaa "akavita main abhivyakti ke anek str sambhav hai
 In language and narrative, he is not committed, hence 'flexible'
 usamen jatil or 'tipsi' prakriyaayein hai-- sidhi or tuuti baaten hai
 "akavita's spokesperson Kavi also mentions that" new poetry or newcomers are not worthy of opposition to Akavita
 aandolan vritti ke log vyarth hi ise gut yaa shadyantr kii sangya dete hai
 " akavita ke andolan ko bhi bitanic aandolan ke saath jude hone kaa aarope lagaaya gaya
 However, its proponents Jagdish Chaturvedi and Shyam Parmar described the behavior of the Beatnikis as blasphemous and absolutely denied their involvement with 'akvita'
 san 1965 se 67 tak nikalne vaali 'akavita' patrika ke prastaavkon main girijakumar maathur, prabhakar machave, bharat bhushan agarwal, vimal or atul aadi ke naam bhi saamne aaye the
 In this context, the works of Saumitra Mohan and Mudrarakshas are also notable
 america bitanic prabhaav ke kaaran dow0 prabhakar machave, bangla prabhaav ke kaaran raajakmal choudhary tathaa ginsvarg ke prabhaav ke kaaran trilochan or shamsher bahadur singh ne bhi beet kavita se apane aap ko sambhddha kiya tha
 In magazines called 'kriti' and 'expression', Machwe ji also declared his belief
 elahabaad se prakashit 'vidrohi peedi' ke kaviyon par bhi apratyaksh rup se yah prabhaav dikhaa
 Laxmikant Varma was the promoter of 'fresh poetry'
 verma ji pehle 'nayi kavita' ke bade samarthakon main se the
 He wrote the first important book related to the theoretical analysis of new poetry, 'paradigms of new poetry'
 parantu, baad main manyata badalane par ve 'taaji kavita' ke pravartak bane
 She started the movement of 'fresh poetry' because in the new poem, there was no longer any 'newness' and she had become distinguished in a particular way
 verma ji kaa yah bhi kahana tha ki "nayi kavita kaa adhikansh paroksh rup se nabhinal dwaara chhayavaad se jeevanshkti letaa rahaa tha
