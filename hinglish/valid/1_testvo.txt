 Let: Icm is inertial relative to an axis going from the mass center of the body, m is the mass of the body and d is the vertical distance between the new and old axes
 to naye aksh z ke parit: pind kaa jadtwaghurna nimnlikhit sameekaran kii sahaayta se paaya ja saktaa he-: This equation can be used to calculate the inertia in many situations using the equation of the stretch rule and the vertical axis

 George i was the Emperor of Great Britain and Ireland from 1 August 1714 until his death
 china-pakistan aarthik galiyara yaa urdu main pakistan-china iqatisaadi raahdaari ek bahut badi vanijyik pariyojna he, jiskaa uddeshy dakshin-pashchimi pakistan se china ke uttar-pashchimi swytt kshetra shinjiyang tak guadar bandargah, railway or hive ke madhyam se tel or gas kii kam samay main vitaran karnaa he
 The Economic Corridor holds central importance in sino-pak relations, the corridor is approximately 2442 kilometers long from Gwadar to Kashgar
 yah yojana ko sampoorn hone main kaaphi samay lagegaa
 The plan is estimated to cost $ 46 billion
 yah galiyara pakistan adhikrut kashmir, gilgit-baltistan or baluchistan hote hue jaayegaa
 According to various reports, Gwadar Port is being developed in such a way that it will be able to send 19 million tonnes of crude oil directly to China
 yadhyapi is pariyojna kii pariklpana 1950 ke dashak main hi kii gayi thi, lekin varshon tak pakistan main raajnneetik asthirataa rahane ke kaaran is lakshya ko praapt nahin kiya ja sakaa
 China started construction work at Pakistan's Gwadar port in 1998, which was completed in 2002
 china kii shi jinping kii sarkaar ne saal 2014 main china-pakistan aarthik galiyare kii aadhikarik rup se ghoshnaa kii
 Through this, China announced about $ 46 billion for various development works in Pakistan
 18 disambar 2017 ko china or pakistan nen milakar is aarthik galiyare kii lambi avadhi kii yojana ko manjuuri de di
 Under this scheme, China and Pakistan will remain economic partners till 2030
 iske saath hi pakistan ne is yojana main chini mudra yuan kaa istemaal karne kii bhi manjuuri de di he
 India has considered the construction of the corridor illegal according to international law as it passes through Pakistan occupied Kashmir, which India considers its part
 is maamle main bharat ne china ke raashtrapati shi jinping se bhi aapatti darj karai thi
 India has also expressed its opposition to the Russian government over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir
 mana ja rahaa he ki pakistan or china ke bich 46 billian dollar kii badi laagat se banane vaala yah galiyara dakshin asia ke bhu-raajnneetik paridrishy main bada badlaav laane vaala siddh hoga
 The purpose of this corridor is to establish connectivity between Kashgar in China's northwestern Xinjiang province, Gwadar port in Balochistan, Pakistan, through a 3000 km wide network of roads and other infrastructure projects
 dastavejon ke anusaar, ise 2030 tak puraa hona he, or yah donon deshon ke liye phydemand hoga
 Once this corridor is built, China will use the truncated roadway to import energy, as opposed to the current 12,000 km long route
 isse prati varsh china ke lakhon dollar kii bachat hogi
 Also, its access to the Indian Ocean will also become easier
 pakistan ko aashaa he ki isse uskaa infrastracchar viksit hoga or badale main uske jal, saura, ushma or pawan sanchalit urja sanyantron ke liye 34 billian dollar kii sambhavit prapti hogi, jisase uski gambhir urja sankat main kami aayegi yaa vah puri tarah se khatm ho jaayegi
 Iran, Russia and Saudi Arabia are also very excited about being part of CPEC in the future
 is sambhaavna ne is bahuprachaarit aarthik galiyare ke rahasy ko or badha diya he
 At the same time, this agreement is the less publicized side - under this deal China will also supply eight submarines to Pakistan, which will greatly increase Pakistan's naval power
 pakistan main china kii ruchi keval aarthik laabh tak hi simit nahin he
 The fully-operated Gwadar port will not only bring commercial benefits to China, but will also bring it strategic and geopolitical benefits on a large scale
 haalanki, vartmaan main guadar ko keval vyavsaayik hiton ke liye viksit kiya ja rahaa he, lekin is baat kii puri sambhaavna he ki bhavishya main ise ek purna susajjit nausainik adde ke taur par viksit kiya jaye
 In such a situation, China can get a large-scale strategic advantage in the region
 jaisaa ki sarvavidit he, pakistan in dinon charampanth, aatankwaad or bhrashtachar ke sabase bure daur se guzar rahaa he, aise main uskaa iraadaa is pariyojna se na keval aarthik laabh lenaa hoga, balki china kii saraparasti main apni vaishvik chhavi ko sudhaarna bhi hoga
 However, Pakistan will also have to balance its potential negative effects with the anticipated benefits from CPEC
 yadhyapi is galiyare se pakistan ko ek vrahat aarthik laabh milegaa, parantu isaki kshamta or aarthik auchity ko lekar kai shankaaen bhi hai
 At the same time, Pakistan is facing a lot of internal and external political challenges these days, which can be a hindrance in the development of the corridor
 galiyare ke nirmaan kaaryon kii vajah se pakistan main karyrat chini shramikon, adhikariyon or ejiniyaron kii suraksha main yahaan hajaaron kii sankhya main chini surakshakarmi tainaat hai or itani badi baat ko pakistan ne nazarandaaj kiya hua he, yah ascharyajanak he
 The presence of such a large number of foreign troops on Pakistani soil should be a matter of concern for the Pakistani establishment, especially given the new imperialist thinking of China and the efforts being made in Afghanistan to realize it
 vikaas kii aad main is pariyojna ko lekar china jis tarah se pakistan ke prakritik sansaadhaanon, khaskar baluchistan kaa istemaal kar rahaa he, usase yahaan ke kai log chintit hai
 Chinese companies have leased thousands of acres of land in Pakistan to grow crops
 saath hi chini companiyon ko ise niryaat karne ke liye pakistan ko sthaneey kar bhi nahin chukaana padega
 In such a situation, the Government of Pakistan is giving many such resources to China, from which it may face problems later
 is galiyare ke safal hone kii kunjee baluchistan sthit guadar bandargah ke paas he or pakistan kii aakanksha is kshetra kaa aarthik mukhiya banane kii he
 However, the voice over the issue of making Balochistan a separate nation and the controversy arising out of the army's stance due to it, is also presenting many challenges for this corridor
 baluchistan ke naagarik sipiisi kaa virodh kar rahe hai
 If this corridor is successfully constructed, then it is expected that many people from other province of Pakistan will leave their province and settle in Balochistan
 isi kaaran vibhinn sipiisi pariyojna ke liye kaam kar rahe chini ejiniyaron or adhikariyon par balooch vidrohi samoohon dwaara anek hamale ho chuke hai
 At the same time, many banned organizations are threatening this project, although their aim is to equalize their account with Pakistan under this guise
 iske saath hi khaybar pakhtoonkhwaa or sindh jaise praant ke anek raajnneetik sanghathan bhi is galiyare kii vaastavik ruparekha ko badalane ko lekar apni jinta jataa chuke hai
 They believe that this corridor has been deliberately changed to provide economic benefits to Punjab province
 haal main jab ek pakistani rajaneta ne sansad main chetavanee di ki china-pakistan aarthik galiyara ke rup main ek east india company aakaar le rahi he
 This was stated by Senator Tahir Mashhadi, chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Planning and Development, and his main concern was the huge debt owed by Pakistan to China for this corridor
 mashhadi ne chini hiton ke anuroop bijli kii daren nirdhaarit karne kii maang par aitraaj jataayaa tha
 Apart from this, the lack of transparency regarding terms and financial statement is also the biggest cause for concern
 state bank of pakistan ke governor ne bhi kaha he ki unhen nahin pataa he ki 46 billian dollar main se kitna karj he, kitni equity he or kitna saamaan ke rup main aana he
 They have demanded greater transparency
 isi tarah se antarrashtriya mudra kosh ne bhi aarthik galiyare ke sambhavit nakaaratmak parinaamon ko lekar aagaah kiya he
 As this corridor will pass through Pakistan, the infrastructure of all the provinces through this corridor will get a chance to improve
 is mahatvakankshi pariyojna kii ruparekha ke anusaar, iske nirmit hone se nayi sadakon, rajmargon, railway, hawaii addon or bandargahon kaa nirmaan bhi hoga or ve viksit bhi honge
 It is also expected that this would give provinces like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan far behind Punjab in terms of development
 itnaa hi nahin, jab yah pariyojna purna rup se viksit ho jaayegi, to isse bade paimaane par rojgaar bhi srujit hoga
 It is also expected that with this proposed investment of China, Pakistan's gross domestic product will increase by 15 percent to reach $ 274 billion
 pakistan kii sust padi arthvyavastha kaa yahaan ke sthaneey urja sankat se sidhaa sambandh he
 Pakistan has failed miserably to meet its energy needs
 is urja sankat ko dekhte hue sipiisi kul 10,500 megawatt kii duusari urja pariyojnaayen bhi shuru karegi or in pariyojnaon kaa kaam tej gati se hoga, taaki inhen 2018 tak puraa kiya ja sake
 As part of a specific plan, 10 projects of 6,600 MW will be developed in the Thar Desert, which will transform this very remote area into the energy capital of Pakistan

 jo vastu hamaari aankhon se dikhaai na de, vah adrishy kehalaati he
 The feeling of being invisible is called invisibility
 adrishyata us vastu kii sthiti he jise dekha nahin ja saktaa he
 The term is often used in fantasy / science fiction, where objects cannot be seen through magical or technological means; However, its effects can also be demonstrated in the real world, especially in the physics and perceptual psychology classes
 chunki padaarthon ko apni satahon ko pratibimbit karne or darshakon kii ankhon ko maarane vaale strot se dikhaai dene vaale spectrum main prakaash dwaara dekha ja saktaa he, isliye adrishyata kaa sabase prakritik rup ek aisa vastu he jo na to prakaash ko pratibimbit karata he or na hi avashoshit karata he 
 This is known as transparency, and is seen in many naturally occurring materials adrishyata kii dharna kai optical or drishy karkon par nirbhar karti he
 For example, invisibility depends on the eye of the observer and / or the equipment used
 is prakaar kisi vastu ko kisi vyakti, pashu, upkaran ityadi ke rup main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 In research on sensorial perception it has been shown that invisibility is seen in cycles
 adrishyata ko aksar chhadam rup kaa sarvocch rup mana jaataa he, kyonki yah darshakon ko kisi bhi prakaar ke mahatvapurn sanket, drishy prabhaav, yaa maanav ankhon ke liye ja sakane vaale vidyut chumbakeey spectrum kii aavritiyon ko prakat nahin karata he, balki radio, infrared yaa parabangnee tarang dairdhya

 bihar kaushal vikaas mishan bihar sarkaar dwaara chalaaya gaya ek abhiyaan he jo maharashtra ke 'em ke si el' ke tarj par bihar me bhi naye yojanao ko prastut kiya he
 It has presented a skilled youth program for the youth of 15-25 years of Bihar, under which three types of paths have been included
 is yojana ke dwaara yuvaao ko komputor kii jaankaree di jaati he tathaa ise aasaani se prayog karnaa acchhee saili me baat karnaa kisi ke saamne achche se pesh aane kii jaankaree di jaati he
 This plan is the thinking of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who saw a 14-year-old child talking in English in a meeting, which prompted him to do something so that all the people of Bihar could talk in English
 is program me sabase pehle communikesan ko sammillit kiya gaya phir iti or soft skill ko 
 The dream of the Chief Minister of Bihar is that Bihar should be known as Smart Bihar
 ab tak is yojana se karib 1,12,500 yuva jure he jiname se 42,000 se adhik yuvatiya he 
 And this number and it is expected to grow in the future
 is yojana ke dwaara ab tak 1100 ke kareeb KYP kendra khole gayi jisame karib 3000 prashikshit yuvaao ko rojgaar kaa avasar mila
 And more than 25, xxrep 4 0 computers were installed in these centers and connected to a network
 is program ke tahat yuvaao ko ek APP ke dwaara sabhi vishyo kii video ke jariye jankari di jaati he
 The Bihar government believes that if the youth of the state are educated and fulfilled by all kinds of abilities, they will find it very easy to find a job

 panzia, panjeya yaa panji, ek vishaal ekikrut mahadweep tha jiskaa astitv lagbhag 250 million varsh pehle peliojoik or mizozoik yug ke dauraan tha; maujuuda mahadweep apane vartmaan swaroop main isi main se nikal kar aaye hai
 The name was coined in the scientific discussion of Alfred Wegener's theory of continental flow
 apni pustak "da origin of continents and oshans" main unhone mana tha ki sabhi mahadweep baad main vikhandit hone or pravaahit hokar apane vartmaan sthanon par pahunchne se pehle ek samay main ek vishaal mahadweep kaa hissaa the jise unhone "uracontinent" kaha tha
 The term Pangea came to light in 1928 during a symposium held to discuss Alfred Wegener's theory
 ek vishaal mahaasaagar jo panzia ko chaaron ore se ghere hue tha, tadnusaar uskaa naam panthalasa rakhaa gaya
 It seems that the fragmentation and origin of the vast continents is consecutive in the history of the Earth's 4
6 billion years
 panzia se pehle kai anya nirmaan bhi hue ho sakate hai
 Last to second, Panotia was formed 600 million years ago during the Proterozoic Eoin and existed until 540 ma
 panotia se pehle rodenia astitv main tha jo lagbhag 1
1 billian varshon pehle se lekar 750 million varshon pehle tak maujuud rahaa tha
 Rhodinia was formed by the deposition and joining of fragments resulting from the fragmentation of an old massive continent called Columbia or Nuna, built in the period 2
0–1
8 GA
 rodenia ke sateek vinyas or jeeyodynamiks itihaas ko utani behatar tareeke se nahin samajha gaya he jitna panotia or panzia ko
jab rodenia kaa vikhandan hua to yah teen tukdon main bant gaya: proto-loresia kaa vishaal mahadweep, proto-gondvanaa kaa vishaal mahadweep or apekshaakrit chota congou creton
 proto-loresia or proto-gondvanaland ko proto-tethis mahaasaagar ne alag-alag kar diya tha
 Laurentia, Siberia and the Baltic continents were formed soon after proto-laurentia itself split and separated
 isaki daraar se do nae mahasaagaron, ipitas mahaasaagar or pelioasian mahaasaagar kaa bhi nirmaan hua
 The Baltic was located east of Laurentia and north-east of Siberia Laurentia
 600 eme ke aasapaas in mahasaagaron main se zyaadaatar ne waapas ek saath milakar ek apekshaakrit alpaayu vishaal mahadweep panotia kaa nirmaan kiya jisamen dhruvon ke paas badi maatra main jameen or bumadhya rekha ke paas dhruviya mahasaagaron ko jodne vaali sirf ek apekshaakrit choti pattee shaamil thi
 Only 6040 years after its origin, about 540 ma, near the beginning of the Cambrian era Panotia disintegrated, giving rise to the southern continent of Laurentia, the Baltic, and Gondwana
 cambrian kaal main laurenshia kaa swatantra mahadweep, jo uttari america bana, yah teen ore se ghire simaankit mahasaagaron ke saath bumadhya rekha par sthit ho gaya: uttar or pashchim main panthalasik mahaasaagar, dakshin main ipitas mahaasaagar or purv main khantee mahaasaagar
 pracheenatam ordovisian main 480 eme ke aasapaas evalonia kaa chota mahadweep, ek jameen kaa hissaa jo purvottar sanyukt rajya america, nova scotia or england bana, gondvanaa se mukt ho gaya or isane laurenshia kii ore apana safar shuru kar diya
 The Baltic, Laurentia, and Avalonia all united together by the end of the Ordovician period, thus forming a small continent near the Iapetus Ocean called Euramerica or Laurecia
 takkar ke parinaam swaroop uttari epalachiyans kii bhi utpatti hui
 siberia do mahadwipon ke bich khantee mahaasaagar ke saath uramerica ke nikat sthit ho gaya
 When all these incidents were happening, Gondwana slowly slipped towards the South Pole
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa pehla charan tha
 The second phase of Pangea's genesis was Euramerica's collision with Gondwana
 By the Silurian period, 440 MA, the Baltic had already collided with Laurentia to form Euramerica
 evalonia abhi tak laurenshia se nahin takaraayaa tha or unke bich ek samudri maarg, ipitas mahaasaagar kaa ek avshesh abhi tak sikud rahaa tha kyonki evalonia dhire-dhire laurenshia kii ore khisakane laga tha
 Meanwhile southern Europe fragmented from Gondwana and the newly formed rake began to move across the ocean towards Euramerica and collided with the southern Baltic in the Devonian, although this small continent was in the form of an underwater strip
 ipitas mahaasaagar kii shakha khantee mahaasaagar bhi siberia se ek dweepiya vrutt ke rup main sikud rahaa tha jo purvi baltic se takaraa gaya
 a new ocean, the Ural Ocean, was present behind this island
 silurian kaal ke ant main uttar or dakshin china gondvanaa se dur chale gaye or sikudte hue proto-tethis mahaasaagar ke paar uttar kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya or iske dakshini sire par nayaa peleo-tethis mahaasaagar khul rahaa tha
 In the Devonian period, Gondwana itself started moving towards Euramerica, causing the Rake Ocean to shrink
 praarambhik carbonipheras yug main uttar-pashchim africa ne uramerica ke dakshin-purvi tat ko chhu liya tha jisase epalchian parvaton or messeta parvaton ke dakshini hisson kaa nirmaan hona shuru ho gaya tha
 South America moved northward towards southern Euramerica while the eastern parts of Gondwana started moving from the equator to the south pole
 uttari china or dakshini china swatantra mahadwipon par sthit the
 The small continent Kazakhstania collided with Siberia in the Middle Carboniferous era
 pashchimi kazakhstania carbonipheras yug ke ant main baltic se takaraayaa jisase unke bich ural mahaasaagar kaa sampark band ho gaya karne or unamem pashchimi proto-tethis ural parvaton or vishaal mahadweep loresia kii utpatti kaa kaaran bana
 yah panzia kii utpatti kaa antim charan tha
 Meanwhile, South America collided with southern Laurentia, closing the rake ocean and forming the southernmost part of the Appalachians and Ouachita Mountains
 is samay tak gondvanaa dakshini dhruv ke paas sthit ho gaya tha or antarctic, bharat, australia, dakshin africa or dakshin america main glaciaron kaa nirmaan ho gaya tha
 Part of northern China had collided with Siberia by the end of the Carboniferous era and thus the proto-tethys Ocean was completely closed
 parmian yug kii shuruyaat main cimerian plate gondvanaa se vikhandit hokar alag ho gayi or yah loresia kii ore badhane lagi jisase iske dakshini sire par ek nayaa mahaasaagar, tethis mahaasaagar nirmit ho gaya or plato-tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta band ho gaya
 Most of the terrain was still integrated
 trysic kaal main panzia thodaa sa dakshin-pashchim disha main gum gaya tha
 The Cimmerian plate was still crossing the shrinking paleo-tethys which continued until the middle of the Jurassic period
 The paleo-tethys was closed from west to east, thus creating the Cimmerian Orogeny
 panzia angreji ke "si " akshar kii tarah dikhaai detaa tha jisamen si ke andar ek mahaasaagar, nayaa tethis mahaasaagar maujuud tha
 Pangea had cracked by the middle of the Jurassic period, its fragmentation is given below
 panzia ke jeevashm-pramaan main mahadwipon par paayi jane vaali ek jaisi or abhinn prajatiyon kii maujuudagi shaamil he jo ab kaaphi dur chale gaye hai
 For example, fossils of therapsid Listerosaurus are found in South Africa, India and Australia, along with members of the Glossopteris flora that would have extended from the polar circle to the equator if the continents had been in their current positions; Similarly, the freshwater reptile Mizosaurus is found only in the local areas of the coasts of Brazil and West Africa
 panzia ke atirikt pramaan dakshin america ke purvi tat or africa ke pashchimi tat ke bich bhuvaigyanik rujhaanon ke milan sahit isse sate mahadwipon ke bhugarbha main paae jate hai
 The polar ice layer of the Carboniferous period covered the southern end of Pangea
 visheshkar ek hi yug tak kii himandiyon ke sangrah or sanrachanaayen kai alag mahadwipon par paayi jaati hai jo panzia mahadweep main ek saath rahe honge
 Paleomagnetic studies of apparent pathways of polar aberration also support the theory of giant-continent
 bhuvaigyanik chattaanon main chumbakeey khanijon ke unmukhikaran kaa pareekshan kar mahadwipiya platon kii halchal ko nirdhaarit kar sakate hai; jab chattaanon kaa nirmaan hota he, ve prithvi ke chumbakeey gunon ko apane andar samahit kar lete hai or yah sanket dete hai ki chattan ke saapeksh dhruv kis disha main maujuud hai
 Since the magnetic poles tilt toward recurring poles occur only over a period of a few thousand years, measurements are averaged over several lavas of several thousand years to determine a clear average polarity position
 talchhati chattaanon or ghuspaithi aagney chattaanon ke namoonon main ek chumbakeey jhukaav hota he jo aam taur par chumbakeey uttar ke jhukaav main in 'ek saamaan badlaavon' kaa ek ausat hota he kyonki unke chumbakeey kshetra turant nahin ban jate hai jaisaa ki thande ho rahe lava ke maamle main hota he
 The magnetic variations between sample groups that have a difference of millions of years in age are due to a combined real polarity deviation and movement of continents
 vaastavik dhruviya vichlan ke ghatak sabhi namoonon ke liye samaan hote hai or inhen hataaya ja saktaa he
 This gives geologists a part of this drift that shows continental stirring and can be used to help redefine earlier continental conditions
 parvat shrinkhalaaon kii nirantarata bhi panzia ke liye sakshya uplabdh karaate hai
 An example of this is the Appalachian mountain range that extends from the northeastern United States to the Caledonides of Ireland, Britain, Greenland, and Scandinavia
 panzia ke vikhandan ke teen pramukh charan the
 The first phase began in the Early – Middle Jurassic period when Pangea began to diverge from the Tethys Ocean in the east and the Pacific Ocean in the west, eventually leading to the development of the vast continents Lauresia and Gondwana
 jo daraar uttari america or africa ke bich bananaa shuru hua tha usne kai asafal daraaron ko janm diya
 ek daraar ke parinaam swaroop nae mahaasaagar, uttar atlantic mahaasaagar kaa nirmaan hua
 The Atlantic Ocean was not uniformly open; Rifts began to form in the north-central Atlantic
 dakshin atlantic kriteshs tak nahin khulaa tha
 Lauresia started moving clockwise, it moved north to North America and south to Eurasia
 loresia ke ghadi kii disha main badhane se tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta bhi band ho gaya
 In the meantime a new rift had also begun to form on the other side of Africa with the adjacent margins of East Africa, Antarctica and Madagascar leading to the creation of the southwestern Indian Ocean, also opening up in the Cretaceous
 panzia ke vikhandan kaa doosraa mahatvapurn charan praarambhik criteshas kaal main shuru hua jab chota vishaal mahadweep gondvanaa anekon mahadwipon main alag-alag vibhakt ho gaya
 Around 200 MA, the Simaria continent collided with Eurasia as described above
 However, a subduction zone was created when Cimaria collided
 is sabadakshan kshetra ko tethian trench kaha gaya tha
 This sea trench was probably subducted as the Tethyan mid-ocean Ridge, this ridge responsible for the expansion of the Tethys Ocean
 yah sambhawatah africa, bharat or australia ke uttar kii ore badhane kaa kaaran bana tha
 In the early Cretaceous period, the Atlantic, which is today's South America and Africa, was eventually separated from eastern Gondwana, opening the way to the "south Indian Ocean"
 madhya kriteshs kaal main gondvanaa ne vikhandit hokar dakshin atlantic mahaasaagar kaa maarg khol diya tha kyonki dakshin america ne africa se dur pashchim kii ore badhanaa shuru kar diya tha
 The South Atlantic was not uniformly developed; Rather it formed as a crack from north to south
 iske alaava usee dauraan madagascar or bharat antarctic se alag hone lage the or uttar kii ore badhane lage the, jisase hind mahaasaagar kaa rasta khul gaya tha
 Madagascar and India separated from each other in the 100–90 MA at the end of the Cretaceous period
 bharat 15 centimetre prati varsh kii gati se uresia kii ore uttar disha main badhata rahaa or tethis mahaasaagar kaa rasta band kar diya jabaki madagascar vahiin thahar gaya tha or africa plate main sthir ho gaya tha
 The remainder of New Zealand, New Caledonia and Zealandia began to diverge from Australia and was moving eastward towards the Pacific and opened the way to the Coral Sea and the Tasman Sea
 panzia ke vikhandan kaa teesraa mahatvapurn or antim charan praarambhik sinojoik yug main puraa hua
 Lauresia was separated when North America / Greenland was liberated from Eurasia and in about 60–55 MA it opened the Norwegian Sea
 The Atlantic and Indian Ocean continued to expand and the Tethys Ocean's route was closed
 isi bich australia antarctic se vibhajit ho gaya or teji se uttar kii ore bad gaya, thik usee tarah jaisaa 40 million se adhik varsh pehle bharat ne kiya tha or vartmaan main yah purvi asia ke saath ek takkar kii sthiti main he
 Both Australia and India are currently growing in the northeast direction at a speed of 5-6 centimeters per year
 takreeban 280 eme main panzia kii utpatti ke baad se antarctic dakshin dhruv main yaa iske paas rahaa he
 India collided with Asia at the beginning of about 35 MA which led to the formation of the Himalayan orogeny and the Tethys seaway was eventually closed; This collision continues even today
 africa plate ne pashchim se uttar-pashchim tak europe kii ore apni dishaao ko badalanaa shuru kar diya tha or dakshin america uttar kii disha main badhane laga tha, jisase yah antarctic se alag ho gaya or pehali baar antarctic ke aasapaas sampurna samudri parisancharan shuru ho gaya, jiske kaaran mahadweep teji se thanda hone laga or himandiyon kaa nirmaan hone laga
 sinojoik yug ke dauraan hone vaali anya mahatvapurn ghatnaon main california kii khadi kaa khulanaa, alps kaa utthan or japani samudr kaa bananaa shaamil tha
 The fragmentation of Pangea in the Great Rift Valley continues to this day
 gopal bhauna, sanrgarh mandal main bharat ke chhattisgarh rajya ke antargat raigarh jile kaa ek gaanv he
 a closed watershed or inclusive watershed is a geography called a watershed area in which rain or melting ice water collects and stops at a lake, marshy area or dry area instead of flowing into the sea or ocean through a river
 aam taur par jo bhi pani dharti par barish yaa himpat ke kaaran padataa he wo nadiyon, nehron or jharanon ke dwaara oonche ilaakon se nichle ilaakon kii ore bahata he
 These moving groups of water keep converging with each other until a single big river is formed
 phir yah nadi aage chalakar kisi sagar main mil jaati he
 But in areas which are isolated from the seas due to slopes, mountains or deserts, the water stops at the lowest place
 aise sthanon par yaa to jhilein ban jaati hai yaa dharti pani ko sokh leti he
 Some of the largest lakes in the world have some lakes formed due to such closed watersheds, such as the Aral Sea and the Caspian Sea
 angrezi main band jalsambar ko "endorheik basin" kaha jaataa he
 Geographically it is seen that the closed watershed areas are often also desert areas
 aisa isliye he ke agar pani ek hi sthaan par ikkatha hone se uski maatra badhati hi jaae to antat pani apane or samudr ke bich kii rukawat ko parajeet kar hi detaa he
 Scientists speculate that at some time Krishna Sagar was such a closed watershed lake which broke its boundaries due to rising water and got into the Mediterranean Sea
 khule jalsambharon main jo namak or anya padaarth milte rahete hai ve aage chalakar sagar main bah jate hai
 This does not happen in closed watersheds
 pani main mili namak or anya padaarth in jhiilon yaa shushk kshetron main jaakar jamaa hoten rahete hai
 Hence the closed Jalasambhar lakes become very saline over time
 bharat ke rajasthan rajya main ajmer ke paas sthit sambar jhil thik aise hi band jalsambar kii ek khaari jhil he
 Pollution on such lakes also has a very bad effect because the pollutants continue to collect and grow instead of dispersing into the sea
 apni bhinn bhugolic or mausami paristhitiyon ke kaaran alag mahadwipon main band jalsambharon kii sankhya bhi bhinn he
 About 21% of Australia's area is closed watersheds, while in North America, closed watersheds cover only 5% of the area
 puure vishwa kaa lagbhag 18% jamini kshetrafal band jalsanbharon se grast he
 Closed watersheds with the largest area of the world are found in the interior of Asia
 kuch sookhe kshetron main band jalsambar kaa pani namak or anya lavan to le aata he, lekin garmi or shushkta ke kaaran tezi se vashpit hota rahata he
 At some places, the water flows only in one season or after flowing for some yoga, the geographical conditions change and stop coming
 aise shushk jhil vaale ilaaqon main namak kii moti or sakht parat jamkar ek vistrut samtal maidan bana detii he jo milon-koson tak failaa hota he
 Because such salt fields are perfectly flat and very large, they are used by fast trains to set a speed record
 kabhi-kabhi band jalsambharon kii jhiilon kaa aakaar mausam ke saath badalte pani ke bahaav ke saath-saath badalata rahata he
 These lakes shrink during the dry season and increase due to rains or snowfall
 kabhi-kabhi jab pani kam hota he to ek jhil kai choti jhiilon main bat jaati he or phir barishon ke baad pani badhane par milakar phir ek badi jhil ban jaati he
 If economic growth in an area is accompanied by water-resistant dams or canals for irrigation that reduce the flow of water into closed watershed lakes, these lakes often shrink and become very small
 aisi sthiti main un aabaadiyon par bahut karaab asar padataa he jo apane vyavsaay yaa jivan ke liye in jhiilon par nirbhar hon
 Something similar has happened with the Aral Sea in Central Asia
 bahut prasiddh hai

 Architectures are important in the history of a caste when civilization, prosperity and luxury come to them in some degree and they fully express the nature of caste pride, prestige, ambition and spirituality
 pracheen kaal main vaastukala sabhi kalaon kii janani kahi jaati thi
 But with the change of instinct and participation of allied businesses, it is no longer the seal of inclusive protection
 vaastukala puraatan kaal kii saamaajik sthiti prakaash main laanevaala mudranalay bhi kahi gai he
 This is as far as social and other achievements are concerned
 yah bhi kaha gaya he ki vaastukala bhawanon ke alankaran ke atirikt or kuch nahin he
 This is partly true as far as historical architecture is concerned
 phir vaastukala sabhyataa kaa saanchaa bhi kahi gai he
 As far as the archaeological influence is concerned, it is fine, but with a brief look at the history of architecture, it will be clear that the earliest efforts of humans are seen as the habitat cave-habitats of the hunters, the tents of the shepherds and the huts of the peasants
 nauka-awaas or vrikshon par bani jhopadiyaan purakalin vishistataaen hai
 The earliest attempts to build a religious monument were in the form of stone and wooden fences
 in adikalin prayaason main or unke sudhare hue roopon main sabhi deshon main kuch na kuch baaten aisi mahatvapurn or vishisht prakaar kii hai ki bahut din baad kii mahanatam kala kritiyon main bhi ve pratyaksh hai
 In the rapid development of the ages, architecture evolved, molded and conformed to the changing needs of humans - its security, work, religion, pleasure and other epoch-making symbols
 misr ke sade swaroop, china ke maanak abhikalp-swaroop, bharat ke videshi tathaa samrudh swaroop, mexico ke may or astek kii angadh mahima, yunaan ke atyant viksit devaytan, roman samrajya kii bahuvidh aavashyaktaaon kii purti karanevaale jatil prakaar ke bhawan, purakalin aadambaraheen giraje, mahan gothic girizaa bhawan or chitropam durg, turki imaaraton ke utkrisht vinyas evam anupaat or europea punarutthan ke bhavy vaastukiy smarak aitihaasik vaastu ke satat vikaas kaa lekha prastut karte hai
 All these buildings point to great epochs of human development, in which architecture is highly related to the ethnic life, reflecting the talent and ambition of the castes who have a clear imprint on their monuments
 prayek aitihaasik vaastu kii uplabdhiyaan mote taur se do moolbhoot siddhanton se nishchit kii ja sakati hai, ek jo sankalpana main antarnihit he or doosraa jo sarvocch vishistataa kaa dyotak he
 In Egyptian Vastu it is the mystification expressed by huge and massive monuments, in Assyrian, Babylonian and Iranian art, it was armament and luxurious life, in Greek art it was decidedly planned and modified vision which resulted in simplicity and refined perfection
 romanon main yah bhavyata, anand evam shakti kaa prem tha jiske falswaroop vilakshan vaigyanik nirmaan hua
 Among the ancient Christians, this was in the form of a great zeal for the construction of churches that expressed the true simplicity and pride of Jesus Christ; Amongst Gothic makers, this structure was an ardent force with knowledge of mechanics; In the Italian revival it was the scholar of that era
 buddha or hindu vaastukala kaa utkrisht gun uskaa aadhyatmik tatv he, ja uske vikaas main adyopant pratyaksh he
 His dominance over unimaginable wealth, wealth and vast plots in Muslim architecture reflects; Whereas the great Afghani Vastu of India reveals the aggressive tendency of that regime; But the Mughal monuments are excellent in showing the excellent proportions of the Mughals and the love of work and express their life in the warmth of India
 is prakaar bhootkaaleen kritiyon main ham dekhte hai ki chattanon, iton or pattharon main moort ve vichaar hi hai jo uparyukt or vishwasaneey dhang se kisi na kisi rup main gaurav ke shikhar par pahaunchi hui sabhyaataaon kii tatkaleen dharm sambandhi yaa anya jagriti vyakt karte hai
 Over the years, architectural topical consciousness developed in harmony with the environment and local background
 aaj bhi ham pratibhavan vyaktiyon ke liye sarvaadhik upyukt swaroop tatolte rahete hai
 Today, there are some people who are satisfied to follow the ghost, there are others who try to emulate the foreign way
 bahut thode se aise hai jo apane samay, gati or rashtriya drushtikaan ke anuroop vaastu kaa vikaas karte kaa prayaas kar rahe hai
 The effort of this small class is to present a new impact, which inspires the human to think and hold new ideas
 is prakaar se hamaare yug ke bhawan nirmaan karne kaa prayaas karte hai or baad main ye hi bhawan sharir or mastishk ke swasth vikaas ko protsaahat karke jati kaa nirmaan karenge
 Additionally, we see that architecture sometimes transcends known utility requirements and its construction methods
 vaastukala main hi kalpana kii vishuddh sristi, jab saare drushtikon ke vyapak avrodh ke saath vyakt hoti he, tab purnataa ke shikhar par pahunchne main samarth hoti hai, jaise yunaan main zeus ke sir se ethina kii, yaa bharat main swayambhu kii upama
 There is no doubt that buildings are the basis of architecture, but apart from erecting these buildings there is something else like poetry prose is something other than composition
 mithe swar main gaae jane par kavita prabhaavshaalee hoti hi he, kintu jab uske saath upyukt sangeet or layayukt nrity cheshtaayen bhi hoti hai tab vah keval manushya ke hriday kii or vibhinn indriyon ko hi aakarshith nahin karti apitu inke gauravpurn mail se nirmit saare vaataavaran se hi use avgat karaati he
 Likewise, archetypes are replete with philosophical activities, poetic expressions and inclusive lyrical, musical and descriptive meanings, and such exquisite artefacts deserve to be admired by the human in all respects and then gain worldwide fame
 sarvasammat mahan vaastukritiyon kii yah prashasti chirsthayee hoti he or bhavi pidiyon ko prerana detii he
 It is true that there has been a lot of instability in the use of architecture, revealing numberless styles
 kintu un shaileyon se kisi vaastu ko kya prayojan? yaa unka uske yug se kya sambandh? sach to yah he ki vaastukala na koi panth he na style, varan yah to vikaas kaa atoot kram he
 So the object has no special purpose from styles, such as the changing of fashion has no relation to a woman's dress
 is vishay main frankllid rhite ne kaha he ki vaastukala kii paridhi idhar udhar hatati rahati he, uskaa centre nahin badalata
 In the more broad sense of modern architecture, architecture has developed as a result of the search for and struggle for beauty in the presence of restrictions presented by the structural requirements of the configuration and the aesthetic possibilities of the available materials
 jab inke falswaroop kisi rachana kii sristi hoti he, tab aisa lagata he ki aaj kii vaastukala baari rachanaaon or aavritiyon ke rup main vyakt murtikla hi he
 If seen in this context, architecture should be a complete and well-developed creation of one's own initiating mind, which reaches a higher level of self

 acharya kautilya ko ek ore paarangat or doordarshee raajnneetijna ke rup main maury samrajya kaa sansthaapak or sangrakshak mana jaataa he, to duusari ore use samskruti sahitya ke itihaas main apni athulaneey evam adbhut kriti ke kaaran apane vishay kaa ekmaatr vidwaan hone kaa gaurav praapt he
 Kautilya's wisdom, dexterity and foresight is well known in the scriptures, poems and other texts of India
 kautilya dwaara nandavansh kaa vinaash or mauryvansh kii sthapana se sambandhit katha vishnu puraana main aati he
 Despite being a great scholar and general secretary of the Maurya Empire, Kautilya's life was a life of simplicity
 vah 'sada jivan ucch vichaar' kaa sahi pratik tha
 He led a very simple life during his tenure as a minister
 vah ek chota-se makaan main rahata tha or kaha jaataa he ki uske makaan kii deevaaron par gobar ke upale thope rahete the
 He believed that a king or a minister with his character and high ideals could present a model to the people
 usne sadaiv maryaadaaon kaa paalan kiya or karmthata kii jindagi bitaayi
 Later, he is said to have renounced his ministerial career and led a Vanaprastha life
 vastutah use dhan, yash or pad kaa koi lobh nahin tha
 In essence, he was a 'vitiragi', 'ascetic, man of hard work and dignity, whose life is still exemplary
 ek prakand vidwaan tathaa ek gambhir chintak ke rup main kautilya to vikhyath he hi, ek vyaavhaarik evam chatur raajnneetijna ke rup main bhi use khyaati mili he
 He has a historical contribution in the destruction of the Nanda dynasty and the establishment and expansion of the Magadha Empire
 salator ke kathananusaar pracheen bhartiya raajnneetik chintan main kautilya kaa sarvopari sthaan he
 Like Machiavelli, Kautilya has also attempted to separate politics from morality and study it as an independent scripture
 jaisaa ki kaahaa jaataa ha Kautilya's name, date of birth and birthplace have all been the subject of controversy
 kautilya ke naam ke sambandh main vidwaanon ke bich matbhed paaya jaataa he
 The first translator of Kautilya's 'arthashastra', Pandit Shamashastri, has used the name Kautilya
 'kautilya naam' kii pramanikta ko siddh karne ke liye pandit shaamasasthri ne vishnu-puraana kaa hawala diya he jisamen kaha gaya he— a controversy has arisen in this regard and that of Kautilya and Kautilya
 ganpati shastri ne 'kautilya' ke sthaan par 'kautaly' ko zyada pramanik mana he
 According to him, the name Kautalya appears to be correct and consistent due to being a Kutla gotra
 kaamandakeey nitishastra ke antargat kaha gaya he— Sambasiva Shastri has said that Ganapathi Shastri probably used the name Kautilya, considering that Kautilya was a descendant of the ancient saint Kutla, but there is no evidence that Kautilya was of the clan and clan of saint Kutal
 'kotilya' or 'kautaly' naam kaa vivaad or bhi kai vidwaanon ne uthaaya he
 V
A
 Ramaswamy has supported the statement of Ganapathi Shastri
 aadhunik vidwaanon ne donon naamon kaa prayog kiya he
 Western scholars have not given much importance to the controversy between Kautilya and Kautilya
 unke matanusaar is prakaar kii bhranti hijje ke her-pher ke kaaran ho sakati he
 Most Western writers have used the name Kautilya
 bharat main vidwaanon ne donon naamon kaa prayog kiya he, balki zyaadaatar kautilya naam kaa hi prayog kiya he
 Radhakanth's statement in this regard is also particularly notable
 usne apni rachana 'shabdakalpadram' main kaha he Many more names of Kautilya are mentioned
 jisamen chanakya naam prasiddh he
 Many scholars who have called Kautilya as Chanakya are of the opinion that he was called Chanakya because he was the son of Chanak
 duusari ore kuch vidwaanon ke kathananusaar uskaa janm punjab ke chanak kshetra main hua tha, isliye use chanakya kaha gaya he, yadhyapi is sambandh main koi spasht pramaan nahin miltaa he
 One thing is clear that Kautilya and Chanakya are the same person
 uparyukt naamon ke alaava uske or bhi kai naamon kaa ullekh miltaa he, jaise vishnugupt
 It is said that his original name was Vishnugupta
 uske pita ne uskaa naam vishnugupt hi rakhaa tha
 Kautilya, Chanakya and Vishnugupta find many references related to the three names, but apart from these three names, many other names are mentioned, such as Vatsyayan, Malang, Dravimal, Angul, Varanak, Katyan etc
 in these different names
 Which is the correct name and which is the wrong name, it is a matter of controversy
 parantu adhikansh paashchaatya or bhartiya vidwaanon ne 'arthshaastra' ke lekhak ke rup main kautilya naam kaa hi prayog kiya he
 Some Western scholars have put a question mark on the existence of Kautilya
 vinternij, jolly or kith ke matanusaar kautilya naam pratikatmak he, jo kootneeti kaa pratik he
 His views are supported by Kantilya's absence in his epics by Pantajali
 jolly ne to yahan tak kah daalaa he ki 'arthshaastra' kisi kautilya naamak vyakti kii kriti nahin he
 This is a text composed by another Pandit or Acharya
 shaamasasthri or ganapatishastri donon ne hi paashchaatya vichaarkon ke mat kaa khandan kiya he
 Both of them are convinced that Kautilya had complete existence, even if there is a difference in his names
 vastutah in teenon paashchaatya vidwaanon ke dwaara kautilya kaa astitv ko nakaarne ke liye jo bindu uthaae gaye hai, ve anargal evam mahatvaheen hai
 Western scholars state that Kautilya has not mentioned anywhere that he was an Amatya or a minister during the reign of Chandragupta Maurya, hence the writing of that ‘arthashastra’ cannot be considered
 yah bachakaana tark he
 It is clear from many references to Kautilya that he, with the help of Chandragupta Maurya, destroyed the Nanda dynasty and established the Maurya Empire
 kautilya kii kritiyon ke sambandh main bhi kai vidwaanon ke bich matbhed paaya jaataa he
 There is no definite information available regarding how many works of Kautilya are there
 kautilya kii sabase mahatpurna kriti arthshaastra kii charchaa sarvatra milti he, kintu anya rachanaaon ke sambandh main kuch vishesh ullekh nahin miltaa he
 Kamandaka, a disciple of Chanakya, has written in his treatise called 'nitisara' that Vishnugupta Chanakya extracted the nectar of ethics by churning the Mahomedi of economics from his intellect
 chanakya kaa 'arthshaastra' sanskrit main raajnneeti vishay par ek vilakshan granth he
 Shlokas of its policy are prevalent from house to house
 peeche se logon ne inke niti granthon se gata badhaakar vriddhchanakya, laghuchankya, bodhichanakya aadi kai nitigranth sankalit kar liye
 Chanakya was a scholar of all subjects
