 He also has an astrological treatise called ‘vishnugupta Siddhant’
 kehete hai, ayurveda par bhi inkaa likhaa 'vaidyajivan' naam kaa ek granth he
 Justice commentators consider Vatsyayan and Chanakya to be one, but this confusion is the origin of this verse of Hemchand: yon dhaatukautilya or raajnneeti naamak rachanaaon ke saath kautilya kaa naam joda gaya he
 Some scholars believe that in addition to 'arthashastra', if other works of Kautilya are mentioned, it may be a compilation of Kautilya's sayings and statements
 rajya kii utpatti ke sandarbh main kautilya ne spasht rup se kuch nahin kaha kintu kuch sanyogvash kii gai tippaniyon se spasht hota he ki vah rajya ke daivi siddhant ke sthaan par saamaajik samjhaute kaa pakshdhar tha
 Like Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau, he calls the natural condition of the state before its anarchy
 rajya kii utpatti tab hui jab 'matsay nyaay' ke kanoon se tang aakar logon ne manu ko apana raja chunaa tathaa apni krishi upaj kaa chatha bhaag tathaa swarna kaa dasva bhaag use dena sweekaar kiya
 In return, the king took responsibility for their safety and welfare
 kautilya rajtantr kaa pakshdhar he
 Kautilya has discussed seven elements of the state by not giving details of the four essential elements of the state - land, population, government and sovereignty, propounded by Western political thinkers
 is sambandh main vah rajya kii paribhaasha nahin detaa kintu pehle se chale aa rahe saptang siddhant kaa samarthan karata he
 Kautilya has compared the state to the human body and has accepted its form
 rajya ke sabhi tatva maanav sharir ke ango ke samaan paraspar sambandhit, antanirbhar tathaa mil-julkar kaary karte hai- Population includes farmers, entrepreneurs and subjects contributing to economic production
 praja ko swamibhakt, parishramee tathaa raja kii ajna kaa paalan karne vaala hona chahie
 In this way, Kautilya's Weekend Principle highlights the important role of all the organs while representing the invariable form of the state
 yadhyapi yah siddhant rajya kii aadhunik paribhaasha se mail nahin khaataa, kintu kautilya ke rajya main aadhunik rajya ke chaaron tatva vidyaman hai
 District is land and population, amatya is the feeling of government and Swami is the symbol of sovereignty
 kosh kaa mahatva rajprabandh, vikaas va sanvardhan main he tathaa sena aantarik shaanti vyavastha tathaa bahari suraksha ke liye aavashyak he
 Friend plays an important role in foreign affairs, but the fortification has been replaced by other tools of defense and defense in the modern era
 pracheen bhartiya raajnneetik chintan kaa anukaran karte hue kautilya ne bhi rajtantr kii sankalpana ko apane chintan kaa kendra banaaya he
 He considers the power of the king to be paramount in temporal matters, but in matters of duties, he himself is bound in religion
 vah dharm kaa vyaakhyaata nahin, balki rakshak he
 Kautilya, considering the state as practicable in itself, has given it the highest position in social life
 rajya kaa hit sarvopari he jiske liye kai baar vah naitikta ke siddhanto ko bhi pare rakh detaa he
 According to Kautilya, the aim of the state is not just to establish peace and order, but to contribute to the supreme development of the person
 kautilya ke anusaar rajya ke kaary hai- The king's tasks are to protect the state from external enemies and invaders, to protect the internal system of justice and to protect the people from divine calamities - floods, earthquakes, famines, fires, epidemics, deadly animals
 swadharm ke antargat varnashram dharm par bal diya gaya he
 Although Kautilya does not subject the state to religion as Manu like religion, but the king preserves religion if the subjects are not followed by religion
 raja kaa karttavya sarsaadhaaran ke liye saamaajik nyaay kii sthapana karnaa he
 Proper functioning of the social system is possible only when father-son, husband-wife, guru-disciple etc
 fulfill their responsibilities
 vivaah-viched kii sthiti main vah stri-purush ke samaan adhikaron par bal detaa he
 Feminine and Brahmin killing is considered a serious crime
 kautilya ke rajya kaa kaary-kshetra atyant vyapak he
 He entrusts the responsibility of multi-faceted development of human beings to the state and makes it a welfare state of the modern era
 usne rajya ko anek kaary saunpe hai
 Such as construction of dams, ponds and other means of irrigation, development of mines, plowing of wastelands, animal husbandry, forest development etc
 inke alaava saarvajanik manoranjan rajya ke niyantran main tha
 The orphans, the poor, the help of the handicapped, the protection of female dignity, the system of remarriage etc
 were also the responsibility of the state
 is prakaar kautilya kaa rajya sarvavyaapak rajya he
 Its goal is to establish public welfare and good administration, in which religion and morality are used as an instrument
 kautilya kaa kahana he, At another place he wrote
 is sambandh main salattore kaa kathan he, ‘‘jis rajya ke paas satta tathaa adhikaar he, uskaa ekmaatr uddeshy apni praja kii prasannataa main vruddhi karnaa he
 Thus Kautilya has appropriately directed the actions of a welfare state
 ’’ Kautilya has discussed not only the internal work of the state, but also the external functions in detail
 is sambandh main vah videsh niti, anterrashtriya sambandhon tathaa yuddh va shaanti ke niyamon kaa vivechan karata he
 In order to analyze the relationship of diplomacy, he has given the board theory- kautilya ne apane mandal siddhant main vibhinn rajyon dwaara duusare rajyon ke prati apanaai niti kaa varnan kiya
 In ancient times, many small states existed in India
 shaktishaalee raja yuddh dwaara apane samrajya kaa vistaar karte the
 States often compromised in other states in terms of security
 kautilya ke anusaar yuddh va vijay dwaara apane samrajya kaa vistaar karne vaale raja ko apane shatruon kii apekshaakrit mitron kii sankhya badhaani chahie, taaki shatruon par niyantran rakhaa ja sake
 On the other hand, weak states should be vigilant against powerful neighboring states
 unhen samaan str vaale rajyon ke saath milakar shaktishaalee rajyon kii vistaar-niti se bachane hetu ek gut yaa ‘mandal’ bananaa chahie
 Kautilya's Mandal theory shows on the basis of geography how the neighboring countries of the state desiring victory can be its friends or enemies
 is siddhant ke anusaar mandal ke kendra main ek aisa raja hota he, jo anya rajyon ko jeetne kaa icchhuk he, ise ‘‘vijigeeshu’’ kaha jaataa he
 The first state to come in the path of "vijigishu" is "ari" and the state adjoining the enemy is "enemy of enemy", hence he is friend of Vijigishu
 kautilya ne ‘‘madhyam’’ va ‘‘udasin’’ rajyon kaa bhi varnan kiya he, jo samarthy hote hue bhi ranneeti main bhaag nahin lete
 This theory of Kautilya is based on realism, which emphasizes making the balance of power through treaties and agreements, considering wars as the reality of international relations
 kautilya ne videsh sambandhon ke sanchaalan hetu chah prakaar kii nitiyon kaa vivaran diya he- According to Kautilya, these policies should be used by the king only for the welfare of the state
 kautilya ne rajya kii videsh niti ke sandarbh main kootneeti ke chaar siddhanton sam, daam, dand tathaa bhed kaa varnan kiya
 According to Kautilya, the first two principles should be used by weak kings and the last two principles should be used by strong kings, but it is also of the opinion that the value is equal, the price is different and the punishment is better than punishment
 dand kaa prayog antim upaay ke rup main kiya jaae, kyonki isse swayan kii bhi kshati hoti he
 Kautilya has described in detail the types and functions of detectives
 guptchar vidhyaarthee grihapati, tapasvi, vyapaaree tathaa vish -kanyaon ke rup main ho sakate the
 The ambassadors also played the role of undercover
 inkaa kaary desh-videsh kii gupt suchnaayen raja tak pahunchaana hota tha
 They contributed to assess the state of public opinion, control the rebels and destroy the enemy state
 kautilya ne guptcharon ko raja dwaara dhan va maan dekar santusht rakhane kaa suzav diya he
 The thoughts of great men have a great influence in the life of people
 chanakya ke vichaaro ne bhi kai logo ke jivan ko unnat kiya he
 Many books have been written about Chanakya's diplomacy and its principles
 chanakya ke jivan ko padhanevaala or iskaa anusaran karanevaala ek bada varg he
 Chanakya's thoughts are called priceless
 chanakya ke vichaar adhyaaapak, raajnneetijna or vyavsaayik logo ko kaaphi pasand he
 Reading about the glorious personality of Acharya Chanakya brings new energy
 kautilya ke vichaar aaj bhi preranadai banate he
 It is true that Kautilya has described a vast organization of secret systems to protect the nation
 shatrunash ke liye vishakanya, ganika, aupnishadik prayog, abhichaar mantra aadi aniatik evam anuchit upayon kaa vidhaan he or is uddeshy kii prapti ke liye mahaan dhan-vyay tathaa dhan-kshay ko bhi raashtra-niti ke anukool ghoshit kiya he
 Seeing such discussions in 'kautilya Arthashastra', Mudrarakshaskaar poet Vishakhadatta Chanakya has been called untruthful and Banabhatta has condemned 'kautilya Arthashastra' as 'nirguna' and 'atinrushyansprayopadesham'
 'manjushri mulkalp' naam kii ek naveen uplabdh aitihaasik kriti main kautilya ko ‘durmati’, krodhan or ‘paapak’ pukarkar garha kaa paatr pradarshit kiya gaya he
 Many modern Western scholars, who specialize in orientalism, have also compared Kautilya to the famous author and politician Mekiavali of Europe, who, in his book 'the Prince', saw the above unethical systems, taking shelter of all the improper means appropriate to achieve the goal
 Has preached vinternitz aadi paashchaatya vidvan kautilya tathaa mekiyavali main nimnlikhit samanthaayen pradarshit karte hai: It is not rational to show such similarity in Kautilya and Mekiavali
 nissandeh kautilya bhi mekiyavali ke samaan yathartwaadee tha or keval adarshavaad kaa anuyaayi na tha
 But to say that Kautilya had completely abandoned religion or morality would be contrary to the truth
 kautilya ne ‘arthshaastra’ ke pratham adhikaran main hi sthapana kii he; That is, do not let the king subjects be disinherited from their religion
 raja bhi apane dharm kaa aacharan kare
 The king who conducts his religion in this way remains happy in this world and the hereafter
 isi pratham adhikaran main hi raja dwaara amaryaadaaon ko vyavasthit karne par bhi bal diya gaya he or varna tathaa ashram-vyavastha ko sudrudh karne ke liye aadesh diya gaya he
 Here the trilogy and the Vedic rituals have been told the basic basis of protection of the subjects
 kautilya ne sthaan-sthaan par raja ko vridhon kii sangat karne vaala, vidya se vinamr, jitendriya or kaam-krodh aadi shatru-shadvarg kaa daman karne vaala kaha he
 How can such a king persecute people by becoming irreligious or tyrannical? In contrast, the king has been called father-like for the subjects, who does the upbringing, enrichment, protection, maintenance, teaching, etc
 of his subjects as he does for his children
 yah thik he ki kautilya ne shatrunash ke liye aniatik upayon ke karne kaa bhi upadesh diya he
 But in this regard the following word of economics should not be forgotten: arthath- in kootneeti ke upayon kaa vyavhaar keval adharmik evam dusht logon ke saath hi kare, dharmik logon ke saath nahin
 Kautilya's state theory is an important contribution to Indian political thought
 usne raajnneetik shaastra ko dharmikata kii ore adhik jhuke hone kii pravriti se mukt kiya
 Although he does not oppose religion and morality, he has kept politics free from the restrictions of ordinary morality
 is drushti se uske vichaar europea darshanik maikyavali ke vichaaron kaa purv sanket prathit hote hai
 On this basis, he is also called the "machiavelli of India"
 celitor kaa mat he ki kautilya kii tulana arastu se karnaa uchit hoga, kyonki donon hi satta hastgat karne ke sthaan par rajya ke uddeshyon ko adhik mahatva dete hai
 Being realistic, Kautilya has focused more on the practical side of the state
 kautilya kaa rajya yadhyapi sarvadhikari he, kintu vah janhit ke prati udasin nahin he

 He attacks the life of General Amarjeet Bakshi
 general bakshi ko bachaane kii koshish karte samay brigadier shekhar sharma ek jaanaleva goli kaa shikaar ho jate hai
 On his death, Shekhar confesses to his son Major Ram Prasad Sharma that Ram is his illegitimate child and that his wife and son abandoned him years ago due to this infidelity
 vah ram se kahata he ki uski aakhri ichha he ki vah apane parivaar ko ek chat ke neeche phir se le aae
 General Bakshi told Ram that the life of his teenage daughter Sanjana is in danger
 ram ko uski suraksha sunishchit karne ke liye sanjana kii kaksha main ek chaatr ke rup main gupt rup se jane ke liye kaha jaataa he
 Ram is reluctant at first but then knows that his younger half-brother Lakshman "lucky" is studying in the same college
 ram sahamat hota he or apane mishan ko shuru karata he
 Ram meets Sanjana, who is Lucky's friend and secretly loves him
 sanjana ram ke lagaataar dosti ke prayaason ke kaaran pareshaan hoti he or use usase dur rahane ke liye kahati he
 Lucky races with a student which includes reaching the roof of the school
 lucky chat se phisal jaataa he lekin ram dwaara use samay se pakadaa jaataa he
 This makes the two friends
 iske turant baad, lucky kii maa shrimati sharma ke ghar ram kiraayedaar ke rup main rahane lagata he
 Ram eventually forges good relations with other college students
 vah apane professor sushri chandani ko lubhaane main safal hota he or lucky or sanjana ko romani rishte main sanlagn karata he
 Also, Major Raghavan attends the college

 Mrs
 Sharma and Lucky find out that Ram is in fact Shekhar's son and expel him from their home
 tab ram bataata he ki wo unki jindagi main kyon aayaa or apane pita kii asthi or unki aakhri ichha prakat karata he
 This changes the heart of Mrs

 As of 2009, it was reported that the Indian government was not considering development of an intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of 10,000 km or more
 ek lambii duuri antaramahadwipiya belistic missile ke liye ek kaarykram kii atakaley 2011 main phir shuru ho gai
 Some reports have claimed that the intercontinental ballistic missile is already named "surya" and the name code Agni-6
 anya reporton se bataaya diya gaya ki nai dilli antaramahadwipiya belistic kii aavashyaktaa ke liye gambhir nahin he
 DRDO can initiate a project to develop India's intercontinental ballistic missile only after permission from the Government of India
 chunki bharat 27 june 2016 tak missile praudyogiki niyantran vyavastha kaa hastaksharkarta nahin tha
 So the Indian missile program was not limited by any treaty commitment to the development of intercontinental ballistic missile capability
 kuch media reporton ne kabhi-kabhi bataaya tha ki bharat emticiar ke liye ek gaiyr-hastaksharkarta hone ke kaaran 5000 kilometre kii seemaa se pare mixilon ke vikaas par ek svaichhik adhisthgan he
 The missile technology control system does not prevent India from developing missiles beyond 5,000 km
 emticiar ek alag rajya ke liye missile praudyogiki ke hastantaran ko roktaa he jisase missile praudyogiki prasar naa bade
 The treaty does not differentiate between MTCR signatories and non-mtcr signatories regarding the transfer or component of technology
 missile praudyogiki niyantran vyavastha sandhi kaa hastaksharkarta desh kisi dusre desh ko missile praudyogiki nahin de saktaa he
 However, there is a legal argument that transferring missile technology to a signatory country of a missile technology control regime is not considered a dissemination

 Breaking out of the regional context is important as the country's sphere of influence increases
 kisi bhi desh par hamaare paas koi kshetreey dizin nahin he
 But India needs its own sphere of influence
 " In October 2011, a report published by The Pioneer doubted the drdo's ability to independently develop "seeker technology" for icbms, using technology only to allow the missile to reach more than 10,000 kilometers
 isi report ne bharat ko "sadhak praudyogiki" main sahaayat pradaan karne kii rus kii ichha par jor diya
 The authenticity of this report is disputed by at least one foreign newspaper, making counter-claims that Russia's involvement is unlikely, because if the report about Russian involvement is true, Russia has violated the missile technology control system 
 jo rus itani aasaani se nahin kar saktaa he
 It is a member country of the Missile Technology Control Regime

 On 20 June 2011, Indian Defense News published an article about 10,000 km of icbms called Bharat Gambhir stating that India is seriously considering expanding the reach of its strategic missiles and that the Ministry of Defense The proposal is considering that intercontinental ballistic missiles should be capable of hitting targets 10,000 kilometers away

 In April 2012, following the successful launch of Agni 5, Saraswat revealed that India had no plans to discontinue the Agni program and could build more missiles in the Agni missile series
 may 2012 main, reporton ne agni shrinkhalaa main ek or isibiem agni 6 missile ke vikaas kii pushti kii
 It was said that the missile would be developed in 2014 and could range from 8,000 km to 10,000 km

 In January 2013, DRDO chief VK Saraswat said that after the development of Agni 5, DRDO would develop Agni 6, which would have several independently targetable re-entry vehicle capabilities
 unhone kaha ki missile kaa dizin puraa ho chukaa he or ab diardio hardware charan par kaary kar rahi he

 Among all things, i began to hear the same echo with my inner ear; o respondent great question! Hail the divine imagination that has engraved you in the upright soul of a wise man! Or you are the Golden kirti-pennaka who is expressing the importance of human beings in the world
 dhvanit ho rahe ho tum samast charaacharon ke bheetar shaayad, aatmshodh kii prerana dene valetumhaare aamantran ko sunakargaayen dekh rahi hai apni parchhaayi ko jhukkar
 Sparrows are finding themselves with their beaks in the spreading fingers
 khoj rahaa he ashwatth apni deergh jataaon ko failakarmitti main chhipe mul beej ko; or, sadiyon ssapane hi sharir kaa vishleshan kar rahaa he pahaad
 Oh my imagination, you are trying in vain to touch the supernatural elements
 kahan tak unchi ud sakegi yah patangumere mastishk kii pakad main ?jhuk jaao mere sir, munne ke jigyaasa bhare prashn ke saamne ! gir jaao, he granth-vigyaan mere sir par ke nirarthak bhaar-se tum is mitti par
 You do not even have a corpus in the breast to extinguish the increased truth of the child
 is nanheen si buddhi ko thaamne-sanbhaalane ke liye koi shaktishaalee aadhaar bhi tumhaare paas nahin ! ho saktaa he, maanav kii chintaa prithvi se takraayeor siddhanth kii chinagaariyaan bikher de
 But, in the darkness, the essence of that great truth remains the same even today
 ghadiyaan bhaagi ja rahi thim sau-sau chintaaon ko kuchalakar;vismayakari veg ke saath ud-ud kar chhip rahi thimkhaare samudr kii badalati hui bhavanaekavyakt aakaar ke saath, antariksh ke path par
 My son repeated the question, impatient at the silence of the mother
 "mere laal, meri buddhi kii ashanka abhi tak thithak rahi heis viraat prashn main dubkee lagane ke liye or jis kotal-sparshi aankhon ne bhi nahin dekha he, us vastu ko tatolane ke liye
 Where did we all come from? i don't know anything! These little ones of yours can only be measured by your hands

 Velupillai Prabhakaran was the leader of the LTTE
 1975 ke aasapaas littey ke gathan ke baad se wo duniya ke sabase taqatvar gorilla ladaakaon ke pramukh ke rup main janaa jaataa tha
 On 18 May 2009, the Sri Lankan army claimed to have killed him
 prabhakaran kaa janm 26 navambar 1954 ko srilanka ke jafana dweep ke samudratati nagar velvettithurai main hua tha
 He was the fourth and youngest child of his parents
 prabhakaran padhai main ausat darje kaa tha
 As a child, she was shy and clinging to books
 srilanka main pruthak ilam kii maang ko lekar pichley teen dashak tak nirmam andolan chalaane vaala velupillai prabhakaran ek pakkaa ladaaka tha, lekin uske virdohi use ek aise mahatvakankshi ke rup main dekhte the jisane asantushton ko kabhi sahan nahin kiya
 Prabhakaran, notorious as 'thambi', was the fourth child of a government official who left school as a child
 prabhakaran, nepolian va sinkadar mahaan se bahut prabhavit tha or usne unki kai kitabon ko padhaa tha
 This was revealed by Prabhakaran in an interview
 inke alaava prabhakaran subhash chandra bose or bhagat singh se bhi bahut prabhavit tha
 Both these Indian leaders believed in violent struggle against British rule
 raajnneeti, rojgaar or shiksha main tamilon ke saath bhed-bhav se aahat prabhakaran ne raajnneetik baithkon main bhaag lenaa shuru kiya or marshall art kaa prashikshan praapt kiya
 
 shri lanka main tamil hindu jo ki alpsankhyakah he or isai bahusankhyak rahete hai
 Till date, Tamil Hindus have not got the right to vote in Sri Lanka
 yahan tak ki shri lanka ke savidhan main saafe taur par likhaa he ki tamil hindu duusare darje ke naagarik he
 If we start telling cow atrocities on Tamil Hindus, then our page will be closed at this time
 aap kalpana kijiye kitna bhayanak rup se tamilo kaa katleam kiya gaya hoga
 In protest against this atrocity, Valipilai Prabhakaran created the LTTE {liberson Tiger of Tamil Ilm}
 hindu tamilo ke saamne sirf do hi raste batch gay the, ek isaayiyo ke atyaachaaro kaa shikaar banakar bujdil ki maut maro or dusraa rasta swabhimaan ke khatir ladate hue maut ko gale laga lo
 The Hindu Tamils chose another route and waged war with Sri Lanka, supporting Prabhakaran
 shruwati dashako main littey ko jabardast kamyaabi mili or aanshik rup se shri lanka haar tak maan lee thi
 That is when our very ex-prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi intervenes and helps Sri Lanka army, yes he heard right, India helps the Christians and waging war against Prabhakaran
 jiske jawaab main prabhakaran, rajeev gandhi ki hatya karvaa dete hai
 If Prabhakaran had been given a little support at that time, then Hindu Tamils would have had a different country and would not have to live with Sri Lanka
 kyunki tab tamilo kaa desh hamaare saath khadaa hota
 Even today the situation of Tamil Hindus in Sri Lanka is pathetic
 srilanka ke purvottar kshetra main ek chote se kasbe main thambi kaa udai hua or tamilon ke liye alag 'grihabhumi' kii maang ko puraa karne ke liye usne 1972 main kuch yuvakon ke ek samooh ke saath 'tamil new tiger' kii shuruyaat kii
 He led this group
 1975 main is samooh kaa naam badal kar libration tigers of tamil ilam rakh diya gaya
 The group became more aggressive after the infamous Vellikade prison massacre
 is narsanhaar main algaavvaadi netaa kuttamani or jagan ko sena ne maar diya tha
 Under Prabhakaran's leadership, the world first became aware of the suicide squad, which was also victimized by former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi
 prabhakaran kii pahchaan ek nirbhik chhapamar ladaake ke rup main thi
 Always equipped with realities and uniforms, Prabhakaran soon emerged as an inspiration to the Tamil rebels
 samarthakon ke liye swatantraaa senaanee tathaa anya logon ke liye durdaat ladaake ke rup main kukhyat prabhakaran aatankwaad, hatya or sangathit aparaadh ke liye 1990 se interpol or anya sanghathanon ko vaanchit tha
 Prabhakaran preferred to be on the battlefield rather than talking at the negotiating table, so when Norwegian mediation broke out in 2002, Prabhakaran used it to organize the LTTE
 parantu sangharsh viraam tikaoo sabit nahin hua or varsh 2003 se varsh 2008 ke bich prabhakaran ko kai jatke lage
 In 2004, Colonel Karuna, once considered Prabhakaran's right hand man, split from him
 do varsh baad altitii kii raajnneetik shakha ke pramukh anton balasingham kii landan main mrityu ho gai
 Balasingham was suffering from cancer
 november 2007 main sena kii bambaari main varisht tamil vidrohi netaa espi tamilchelvam maaraa gaya
 Prabhakaran, who was fighting against the majority Sinhalese regime, was considered a Tamil, freedom fighter, on the other hand, the Sri Lankan government and army considered him a cruel assassin, for whom human life had no value
 varsh 1975 main un par jafana ke meyar kii hatya kaa aarope laga
 This was the first major action by the Tamil rebels
 tamil ilam ke sangharsh main anek sinhalai or tamil netaaon samet 70 hajaar se adhik logon ne praan ganvaae gai
 Former Prime Minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi also succumbed to this terrorism
 prabhakaran sinhalai netaaon raashtrapati premadas, damini dishanayake or ranjan vijayratne tathaa udaaravaadi tamil netaaon appapillai, amirtalingam, yogeshwaran or unki patni tathaa videsh mantri lakshaman kaadirgamar kii hatya kaa uttaradaayi tha
 He did not spare his boys either

 Even today when i think of Ira, i remember Major Solanki, Batra, Doctor and Vimal more than his appearance
 mere kaanon main kabhi daudte hue ghodon kii taapon kii awaz gunjane lagati he, kabhi bataraa kii kad parchaai yaad aati he, kabhi doctor kaa vah jumala- ab jaisaa tum chaaho ! or kabhi vimal kaa dhyaan aata he, jiske sharir main pashine ke kaante ugte the
 And the scenes of Kashmir before me still hang around where Ira told me this
 kai baar maine koshish kii is baat ko, jo rah-rahakar mere dil main ghumad uthati he, kahani ke rup main likh daalun, par pichley teen saal se koshish karte rahane ke baavjood main nahin likh paaya
 Today, even though i am sitting writing it, i am not sure that i will be able to complete it, because even after much thinking, i could not reach any conclusion, nor could i recognize the IRA itself
 bas, itnaa lagata he ki uske liye main sab kuch kar saktaa tha
 Kashmir, Ira, Solanki and me and Dhudhi — also three shadows — are all clumped together
 jab bhi likhane baitha, tab kashmir ke drishyon ko utaarte-utaarte thak gaya or ira na jane kaha kho gai
 And there is also a sense of dishonesty in writing the story about Kashmir
 yahi ghatana kahin bhi ghatit ho sakati thi, hindustan ke kisi bhi hisse main, lekin soundarya-maatr ke prati ira kaa divaanaapan mujhe majaboor karata he ki main kam se kam uske prati anyaay na karuun
 And when i start writing after being inspired by this inspiration, the eternal beauty of Kashmir dominates me

 mere kaanon main ghode kii taapon kii awaz gunjane lagati he or dhire-dhire hilti hui chid kii jhuumaren mujhe spasht dikhaai dekhne lagati hai
 Peach way from Pahalgam! The left Lidder is flowing and the first plateau on the right is covered with grass-flowers
 usee kii qamar par se patala rasta ja rahaa he
 There are densely prickly shrubs everywhere
 pattharon kii ubhari hui rekha us patale raste kii disha bataa rahi he
 The noise of the river is accompanied by the music of the horse's hounds, playing backdrop

 dur chute hue pahalgam kii chahal-pahal aise kho gai, jaise kisi ne darwaja band karke kisi factory ke baahar nikaal diya ho
 Wooden logs are flowing in the edge of Lidder

 mandaraate, chakaraate or sidhi dhar main padate hi shishe kii sataha par phisalte-se
 But the path has climbed so high that its uproar does not come up
 neeche gati he, drishy he or chattaanon se takaraati dhar he
 


 is the row of flying birds
 


maun khadey van hai


yaa chattaanon kii aad main rukkar dam lete hue lakdi ke latthe hai
 Floats of white water are floating white flowers
 avrodh se takaraakar chhitake hue jal-beej hai
 But all selfless, voiceless
 


jaise ekaek cinema main awaz band ho gai ho
 That all of a sudden - the sound of the hounds of a horse! solanki ghoda daudata hua sarapat aadu ke dak bangale kii ore bhaaga ja rahaa he


use is baat kaa bhi khyal nahin ki raat barish ho chuki he or ghoda phisal saktaa he
 The hoof of the horse does not seem to be falling on the ground, as his back legs are ripping like a swan and the Solanki bridle is being repeated on his neck
 yah tashvir kaa ek ruukh he
 Suddenly IRA was found
 


main solanki ko jaanata bhi nahin tha
 We were at Pahalgaam at that time
 or tashvir kaa doosraa ruukh yah he- The electrical wire was broken in the storm that came in the night
 mombatti kii maddhim roshni main sab chijen dhundhuli-dhundhlee lag rahi thim, jaise tamboo main koharaa bhar gaya ho
 i was locked in a steam furnace, with a candle flame shining like a Sholay
 har chiz par momjama padaa hua tha
 The wind outside was still blending
 tamboo kii upree parat neeche jhukati to latake hue kapade aakul jeevon kii tarah kaanpate or unki parachhaaiyaan badi der tak pendulum kii bhaanti ek seemaa main hilti rahati
 Clouds of the night were still stationary in the sky
 pahalgam kii basti neend main dub-utraa rahi thi
 The tents on the far south plateau were lit like torches
 chirban se guzarati hawa kaa swar kisi nazadik kii sadak se lagaataar jaati hui kaaron kii tarah aa rahaa tha
 The smell of soaked grasses was filled all around
 aakhir chadar lapetakar main uthaa
 i moved aside the heavy front curtain of the tent and peeped out
 ‘elpine hotel’ chhaae hue badalon ke ghere main nukile kaale pahaad kii tarah lag rahaa tha
 Ira's room had no lights
 ekaek roshni timatimaai or uskaa failaav bad gaya
 An angel was coming towards me with a lamp in the valley
 us ujaale kaa abhas hi bahut tha
 Like a round door of a lighted tunnel has opened in the dark
 usee swapnil roshni main, khidki ke shishon par, neend ke samudr se ek angadaai hui chaaya dhire-dhire ubhari
 i lifted out the curtain and came out
 ird-gird khadi pahadiyon kii chotiyaan kuch-kuch saaf ho rahi thim
 It was flying unknowingly like a dark spirit
 ira ke kamare kii roshni or saaf ho gai thi
 In the evening, Ira was saying, "you won't wake up!" To show her that and also because we were away from each other's awakened sensation, i also went inside and picked up the torch
 tarch kii roshni se maine apane jaagane kaa signal diya tha
 Then the window opened and the screen of the candle-lit light in the room looked like a picture of Ira, i recognized his lips 


 and that fragrance of the grass, which always lifted from his smooth moist body Used to


 and felt the waves of frenzy waking up asleep in the core of his isolated eyes
 tabhi ira ne koi ishaara kiya tha, par main apane main besudh khadaa tha


yah bhi nahin jaan paaya ki kab ira ne khidki kii carnis par mombatti rakh di, jisaki lau, main uske bal gote ke jhine taron kii tarah chamak uthe the
 And Ira went to prepare a few moments later
 andheri ghati main chamakta hua ek akashadip ! The horsemen were heard coming from some turn below the plateau
 sunakar main taiyaar hone ke liye routi main ghus gaya, kuch der baad ghode vaale ne upar pahunchakar awaz di, ‘saab, sahab !’ i went out, remembering his name and asked, 'mamdu, see these clouds! How fine would it be? i asked to ask but felt that if Mamdu declared bad weather? i wanted Mamdu to say, sir, it does not matter
 ’ The worker has the wonderful power to know the inner will of another
 ek kshan ke liye usne apane saathi ghodevaalon kii ore dekha, uski michamichaati aankhon kii khamoshi main jis bhaavana kaa bodh tha, use usne pahachaanaa or matlab samajhakar naak malate hue bolaa, ‘nai saab, isse koi farak nahin padataa
 'I shouted a sigh of concealment at the impatience of my mind; ‘halki barish main mouj rahegaa saab ! aapako aaraam milegaa
 Mamdu ventured inside to wrap the bed, removing my favor
 tabhi ira ke hotel kaa bos chaay lekar aa gaya, uske peeche-peeche ek mazdoor peeth par ira kaa bistar laade hue bhaaluu kii tarah jhumata hua ghodon ko paas pahunch rahaa tha
 By the time i drank the tea, the bagging mule was ready
 main camera latakaakar or apane tamboo ke chaukeedaar ko hidaayaten dekar elpine hotel kii ore chal diya
 Had told to meet the horseman on the road below
 ujaalaa acchhee tarah fail chukaa tha
 Ira stood by the small gate of the hotel, his feet hidden in the mowed grass
 tum yahaan khadi ho, main vahaan intjaar kar rahaa tha
 On reaching, i said, and she was stuck on my shoulder
 uske sudaul reshmi kandhon par haath rakhte hi ungliyaan chaaron ore se apane-aap simtane lagati thim
 And on the back a little below the shoulder, they automatically closed like a sarcasm
 ira kaa sharir lahar kii tarah siharataa or vyarth mukti kii saar-hin cheshtaa ankhon main aakar puuchhati, kya ? or unamem jhaankate hue prashn or uttar ek hi bindu par aakar mil jate
 An effortless effort beyond question and answer and an enticing process-filled acceptance arising from it
 ghodevaale kolhai ke raste par khadey hamaara intajaar kar rahe the
 Descending from the one-pine hotel, the small township of Pahalgam looked like a railwayyard
 khaas sadak ke kinare lakdi ke makaanon kii qatari railgadee kaa tarah khadi thi
 The lights that had been extinguished overnight and the noise of the Lidder River increased
 khalsa hotel ke kuch log saath chalanevaale the, unka kya hua ? ira ne poocha
 i also wanted to accompany them, easily explained, they will keep coming, we are going fast
 dak bangale main aaraam kii jagah mil jaaegi
 


 i have made a program to stay one night in the peach bungalow and one night in the post bungalow of Lidderwat, then Kolhai! Is it ok ? pehle kahin pahunche bhi ! ira ne kaha to mere man kii baat foot padi, tumne bistar bekaar liya
 


 i have everything extras
 is baat main meraa kuch aashay tha
 But there was no hesitation anywhere on Ira's face
 na jane kyon, saamaanya striyon kii bhanti aisi baton par usamen koi halchal nazar nahin aati thi, jaise kuch bhi anuchit na ho
 She easily rejected all these small social and moral perceptions of men and women, which i considered important
 isse mujhe bal miltaa, main or khulata, ira or unmukt ho jaati
 i took out Lemondraps from my paint pocket and headed towards it
 ek munh main daalkar do-teen baar chuskar usne phenkate hue kaha, kahaan se uthaa laae
 


 fennel and granary, spoiled the flavor of the mouth
 toffi duun ? kehete hue maine jaan-boojhkar aadhi toffi daant se kutar lee or aadhi uski ore badhata hua bolaa main jaanata tha, isliye letaa aayaa
 And in his answer, Ira openly showed the cardamom, i am eating cardamom, you should eat it
 


sunakar mujhe apni galati kaa pataa chalaa or sankoch se gad gaya
 And the boost that Ira's upper spontaneity would make in a moment was wasted by his inner spontaneity
 vah upar se jitani nibasancoch, mukt, nirbandh dikhti thi, shaayad andar se utani hi sankochashil, paramparanuragi or bheeru bhi thi
 The night was very cloudy, it seemed that it would not be able to walk
 maine ira kii manahosthiti kii thaah paane ko baat badal di thi, vah rahasmay-si lagati thi aise avasaron par
 It would slip again and again like a fish

 kshan do kshan haathon main tikti or sarak jaati, din–raat sapanom kii baaten karti xxrep 4 
 While walking on the Dal in Srinagar, he said half-eyes like an imaginative philosopher - Tilak, this wildness in nature, how beautiful it is also
 


main vahashiyon kii tarah jeena chaahati hum
 


 like this wildness of nature! Sometimes i think 


assam kii junglee jatiyon main hi meraa janm hota
 She roamed around with feathers on her hair! i feel that i can grow like cedars among naked rocks
 bas, yahi rahun
 Let the stormy winds make me shudder, In the rain, i will shiver and i will welcome the snow
 


 i smiled in a very practical way
 apane prati upeksha kaa bhav sahan na kar pai thi
 What are you laughing like a fool? Dead people cannot think about all this
 uski awaz main tezi thi or vah kahati ja rahi thi-dal ke teen ore khadi ye pahadiyaan tumhen nahin pukaaratin ! is chikani chattaanon par chadhakar inhen rond daalane kii ichha nahin hoti, kaise aadmi ho tilak ? shikare main baithe-baithe dal ke jal ko bacchon kii tarah uchhalte hue vah bolti ja rahi thi, iske tal tak pahunchakar pani ulichane ko man hota he
 There will be so much happiness in getting trapped in the kelp trap
 yaa us kamalvan main ghus paduun, use rond daalun
 


 bend and scatter the lotuses, make the water of the pulp dirty 


 us par maine use bahut gahari nazaron se dekha tha, baanh main padi chudiyaan sarkaane kaa upkram karte hue uski baanh par pehali baar haath rakhaa tha
 Ira had a stretch of skin
 uskaa rome-rome bhabhar aayaa tha, jaise ret ke kan uske sharir par chipak gayi hon
 He had sultry eyes and alcoholic dryness on his lips
 uske sharir kaa sara ras nichudakar kahi bheetar samaa gaya tha
 The dry body was hard like a dry twig, but the stiffness that broke with a crack at the mere gesture of a finger
 maine uski peeth par haath rakh liya tha
 Ira kept looking at the Chashma Shahi hills
 vaataavaran badalane ke liye maine bahut mulymiyat se kaha, ‘tum ek juthi zindagi kii kalpana main pareshaan ho
 You turned at a wrong turn, so now you do not want to live your life, you want to twist it 


 ira ne apni kaali-kali aankhon se meri taraf dekha, badami putliyon main jaale kii tarah maheen taar chamak rahe the or kendra kaala drushtibindu moti kii tarah jhalmala rahaa tha
 The hairs of his eyelashes stood like barbed wire
 na jane kyon mujhe un ankhon ko dekhakar ki jaise sari galati inhinki ho xxrep 4 
 ira kii soundaryapurna jeevani ko biawan main ghaseet laane kaa dosha in vahashi aankhon kaa he
 Inspired by that i said, in this way you will break
 aadmi-aadmi ke rishte isi tarah pahaad bane khadey rahenge, uskaa pyaar pani kii tarah laharaata rahegaa or camel isi tarah khilte rahenge
 


 and i was silent as soon as i recognized the spirit of my feelings
 kuch der shikare par hi udhar-udhar ghumkar ham nehru park main chale aae the
 Since it was evening, the crowd was more
 nav-vivaahit jode roshni se idhar-udhar railingon yaa jhaadiyon ke paas andhere main khadey the
 i was thinking that i should go to the railing, where it was relatively dark
 itani nikatataa main mahasoos karne bhi laga tha
 Holding Ira's hand, i walked towards that dark railing
 aisi jagahen algaav dikhaane kii hoti bhi nahin, kyonki in jagahon par sanskaar bhi aisa hota he
 Looking down at the railing, waving glistening snakes of light in the tilted water, Ira asked, "tilak, how long will you stay here?" kashmir main ? maine baat saaf karke kaha, jab tak kaho
 Ira did not proceed
 mujhe kuch bura-sa laga
 For the last five days i was in the same mood
 itani nikatataa ke baavjood hamaare vyaktigat tad ke pedo kii tarah alag-alag khadey the; jab bhi baat karata to ira apana purana kissa sunaane lagati-assam kii un bastiyon main rahanaa bahut khatarnaak he


khidki par khadey hote dar lagata tha
 Do not know when the bullet crosses into the chest through the glass
 


aise hi achaanak unki maut hui thi
 Such is the profession of medicine, one has to go overnight
 main bhala kya kahata ! uske pati kii mrityu ke prati ankhon se samvednaa hi prakat kar saktaa tha
 By the way, this sudden death of her husband had a terrible effect on Ira's consciousness, i had not felt till that time
 is vakt jo chota-sa sawaal karke ira khamosh ho gai thi, usase mujhe uljhan ho rahi thi
 She was quietly watching the scenes all around
 shankaracharya kii pahari par jalataa balb mandir jinaki thos parachhaaiyaan pani ko kaala kar rahi thim
 Hariparvat on the left, and blue water of dal spread among them all
 us pani main nahaate hue bent ke ped or sataha par barchhiyon kii tarah nikle hue pets ke sire
 Ira standing nearby between the floating fields and this opulent beauty
 lekin sab bebasii ke kram main aabaddh tha


 sachmuch is tarah main nahin rah paaungaa


yah pani kii aag


yah jhulason ! yaa to isamen kudana hoga yaa is agni-desh se bhaagna hoga


ira kii peeth mere saamne thi xxrep 4 
 paan kii shakl main taraashi hui maance kii naram chattan
 And then, i do not know how, under his knuckle, i had hot lips on the neck 


 The cold eyelids of the washed hair came down on the eyes, the bruised cold, the faint smell of the banaghas 


 The real existence 


 or the senses plastered on the dew-soaked lotus, the soft coolness of the petals, and the faint smell of pollen 


 Then the lotus was crawling on his ear, his fingers trembled
 kaan bhar aae, jaise badhir ho gaya tha us pal


uski ungaliyon ne mere baalo ko buree tarah khinchaa tha or kaanpakar uski pakad dhili ho gayi thi
 xxrep 4 
 and somewhere the silent chimes of the words echoing with the wind were all around 


 bahuton ne pukaara tha mujhe, par aisa chumbakeey par nirpeksh aashay shaayad kabhi bhi kisi kaa nahin tha
 She bent over the railing like Kamalnala, after some time while shaking her hair, said, Call Shikarewale, now we will go
 baandh par aakar ham utar pade the
 By the time i took my hand out, Ira had placed a ten note on Manjhi's palm
 main sakuchaata hi rah gaya
 Manjhi had been with him since the afternoon, till he tried to know the relationship between us, Ira rescued him from his surprise position, said, "sir, come to the bridge first, they have to go there, in their hotel 

" 
 ira aise hi asambaddh ho jaati he
 i had lost this insult, but Ira used to do all this with such dignity that she could not have the courage to defy herself
 jab vah is tarah apane ko kaat-chhaantkar alag khadaa kar leti to uske sharir ke tanaav se tej kii rashmiyaan viksit hotin, jinamein apmaan kaa kshudrata kaa bodh ho sakna sachmuch asambhav ho jaataa
 The 'moment by moment nature changed' truth, it was just like that, Ira! or munh main ilaychi dikhaakar usne aisi hi thes pahunchaai thi, jo mere man kii choti-si baat ko khandit karke aatm-bhartsana se bhar gai thi
 We both were quietly moving towards the horse owners
 ghodevaale safar par jane ke liye vahaan jamaa ho rahe the, jahaan se aadu-kolhai or chandanwari kaa rasta katataa tha
 We were at the end of Pahalgam
 ek awaz sunakar ham donon ne hi us ore dekha, main us aadmi ko nahin pahchaan paaya-surat saaf dikhaai pad rahi thi
 That horse had come running
 ruukhe mote-mote bal, pusht bharaa hua sharir
 Thick and neatly carved lips
 canpatiyon par maansalata kuch adhik thi
 When he came closer, i looked closely - like a grainy rag, rough mouth skin, fine coals of beard and a mustache
 maine is aadmi ko bhi kabhi nahin dekha tha
 Just then Ira exclaimed, hey Solanki, howcome here ? chandalwari se waapas aa rahaa hum, sheshnag gaya tha
 Where were you


? The Solanki asked, by then she had reached her horse
 vah neeche khadi solanki ko is tarah taak rahi thi jaise koi vijayi rajput waapas aayaa ho
 i felt like listening to him that i say - well, i go
 par main khamosh khadaa solanki ke ghode ko takata rahaa jo abhi haaf rahaa tha
 Solanki jumped from his horse and dropped the gloves, took out the pipe from the pocket of the overcoat and started filling tobacco
 pipe bharte-bharte vah bolaa, hamaara ghodevala kah rahaa tha, sahab abhi sardi he; der se chalenge


phir ghode kii ore dekhte hue bolaa, kahata tha, agar aap is pahari raste par ghoda daudaayenge to taang saaf tut jaaegi


yah fouj kaa nahin, vizitor log ke vaaste poni he poni
 He had insisted on the word pony and laughed and then said while burning the pipe, the leg did not break even
 kehete hue usne apane faujee boot se ghode ke takhne par jor se waar kiya
 The horse stung by injury and raised the legs three to four times as if saluting in a circus
 pipe abhi jala nahin tha, uski tambaaku dabaate hue solanki phir bolaa tha, aana to kal shaam hi tha, ek raat chandalwari main ruk gaya
 Waking up in the morning i ran, the mule and its owner coming back
 kehete hue rukkar usne phir pipe sulgaaya or nathunon se dhuen kii patali dhar nikaalte hue bolaa, haa, haa kaho to kolhai chaluun ? or tab usne pehali nazar mujh par daali thi
 When Ira got a sudden knowledge of my presence, she was shocked and said, Hey, this is Mr
 Tilak and you are Major Solanki
 solanki ne lapakar haath milaayaa
 He caught my hand very tightly
 badi shaleenta se chhudaate hue maine kaha tha, abhi aap chandalwari se aa rahe hai, thake honge
 Ira had both a consensus and a disagreement that Solanki said with a puff of smoke and said, no, no, not at all
 or dhuaan uske chaaron ore aise lipat gaya tha, jaise usne paardarshee plastic kaa momjama odh liya ho
 The sweet smell of Egyptian tobacco was bursting from his overcoat
 uske baari-baari juute os se bhiige the

 There is a tendency for transnationalization in vowels - Ainchat, Juan, Inkaar, Bhoojai, Unchiyat, Ananth, Mon
 ‘ya’ ke sthaan par ‘ja’ ho jaataa he- yamuna > jamuna, yash > jas
 'B' is treated in place of 'V' - Var> Bar, Lawyer> Bakil
 kahin - kahin par ‘va’ ke sthaan par ‘u’ bhi prayukt hota he- avatar > autaar
 It also has a tendency to evolve like Awadhi - Khet> Khetu, Marat> Mattu
 kahin-kahin ‘kha’ ke sthaan par ‘k’ uccharit hota he- bheekh > bhik, ‘na’ ‘d’ ho jaataa he- ravan > ravad, gana > gad
 In place of 'S', 'H'- Master> Mahtar, Week> Heptah
 upekshabhaav se uccharit sangya shabdon main ‘ta’ pratyay kaa yoga vishesh ullekhneey he- baniyaan > baneta, kisaan > kisnta, kaachhi > kacheta, baccha > bachchata adi
 In Kannauji's vocals, there is a tendency for desensitization - Ainchat, Juan, Inkaar, Bhoojai, Unchiyat, Ananth, Mon etc
 ‘i’ or ‘ou’ swar sanyukt swar ‘ai’ or ‘au’ ke rup main prayukt hote hai- gaeyaa > gaia, ainak > ainak, aukaat > aukaat
 The feminine suffixes of Kannogy are - e, n, ni, ia

 pranayam = praan + aayam
 It literally means 'to prolong life' or 'to prolong life'
 hathyogpradipika main kaha gaya he- It is also said- pranayam do shabdon ke yoga se bana he- pehla shabd "praan" he doosraa "aayam"
 The meaning of Prana which gives us strength or strength
 aayam kaa arth jaanane ke liye iskaa sandhi viched karnaa hoga kyonki yah do shabdon ke yoga se bana he
 It has the root word "yam" and "A" prefix
 yam kaa arth 'gaman hota he or '"aa" ' upsarg 'ulataa ' ke arth main prayog kiya gaya he arthath aayam kaa arth ulataa gaman hota he
 Therefore, in Pranayama, the dimension has been used in the sense of 'inverse movement'
 is prakaar pranayam kaa arth 'praan kaa ulataa gaman hota he
 It is to be noted here that pranayama is the noun of the particular action of movement, not the result
 arthath pranayam shabd se praan ke vishesh kriya kaa bodh hona chaiye
 Many sages have said about Pranayama in their own way but all have the same feeling like Pranayajam Sutra of Patanjali and Pranayam Sutra of Gitanjali in which Pranayam Sutra is considered important which is as follows- Tasmin sati breathing breathing belief Its Hindi translation will be like this- Pranayama is the separation of the speed of breathing
 is sutara ke anusaar pranayam karne ke liye sabase pehle sutara kii samyak vyakhya honi chaiye lekin patanjali ke pranayam sutara kii vyakhya karne se pehle hame is baat kaa dhyaan dena chaiye ki patanjali ne yoga kii kriyaaon evam upaayen ko yogasutra naamak pustak main sutara rup se sankalit kiya he or sutara kaa arth hi hota he -ek nishchit niyam jo ganitiya evam vigyaan sammat ho
 If the formula is not explained correctly, the answer is far from true and the result will be zero
 yadi patanjali ke pranayam sutara ke anusaar pranayam karnaa he to sabase pehle unke pranayam sutara tasmin sati shwasaprashwasayorgativiched:pranayam
 kii samyak vyakhya honi chaiye jo shastranusaar, vigyaan sammat, taarkik, evam ganitiya ho
 Action has to be done according to this interpretation
 iske liye sutara main prayukt shabdon kaa arthbodh hona chaiye tathaa usamen di gayi gati viched kii vishesh yukti ko jaananaa hoga
 For this, the words used in the Pranayama Sutra of Patanjali should be understood
 shwaas ko dhimi gati se gahari khinchakar rokna va baahar nikaalnaa pranayam ke kram main aata he
 With breathing, feel that the life force, superiority is being drawn in by breathing, while exhaling feel that our bad, vicious feelings, bad thoughts are coming out with exasperation
 ham saans lete he to sirf hawa nahin khichate to uske saath brahmand kii sari urja ko usame khinchate he
 Now you will feel how it will happen just by breathing
 ham jo saans fefdo main khichate he, wo sirf saans nahin rahati usame saare bramhand kii sari urja samaayi rahati he
 Believe that the breath that makes your whole body move, it also has the power to repair your body
