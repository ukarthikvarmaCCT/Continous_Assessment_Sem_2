 Murphy aka Barfi Johnson is an optimistic, inquisitive and captivating young man born in Darjeeling as the silent-deaf child of a Nepali couple
 uski maan kaa bachapan main hi dehant ho jaataa he or uske pita, jo motor chaalak hai, akele hi uskaa paalan-poshan karte hai
 Barfi has been known for his mischief since childhood - which acts like cutting a pole, choking with innocent people, which leads to him being chased by local police officer Sudhanshu Dutta
 barfi shruti ghosh se miltaa he jo abhi-abhi darjeeling pahaunchi he
 Shruti is engaged to Ranjeet Sengupta and is about to get married in three months
 isi bich barfi shruti se takaraata he or use pyaar ho jaataa he
 She too falls in love with Barfi but her mother convinces her not to do so because he cannot take care of her due to his disability and lack of money
 shruti apni maan kii salaah maan leti he or vivaah kar leti he
 After marriage, she moves to Kolkata and ends all contact with Barfi
 isi bich main barfi ke pita biimaar ho jate hai or pita ke ilaaj ke liye barfi ko dhan kii aavashyaktaa padati he
 After an unsuccessful bank robbery attempt, Barfi contemplates kidnapping Jhilmil, his childhood henchman friend and sole heir of his rich grandfather
 apane aagaman par vah dekhtaa he ki jhilmil kaa to pehle se hi apharan ho chukaa he
 He sees her in a van and sneaks into her and drives Jhilmil away from the ransom-collecting location
 police jhilmil kii khoj main he or barfi use apane apartment main chipa letaa he
 After receiving the ransom amount Barfi himself, while paying for his father's operation in the hospital, he learns that his father has died

 apni purv nirdeshit film kits ke nirmaan ke dauraan, nirdeshak anuraag basu ne do-prishthon kii ek laghu kahani likhi jo baad main barfi! kii patakatha ke rup main viksit hui
 The script written by Basu and the reading of the film go back and forth between the two time periods
 basu kaa kahana he ki film-patakatha paatro ke liye 30- varsh kii samyavadhi maangati he atah film kii prishthbhumi 1970 rakhi gayi
 In June 2010, Anurag Basu confirmed that the film will feature three people, a deaf and dumb man, a mentally challenged girl and a recital
 yadhyapi basu ne nirdisht kiya tha ki film ullaspurn hogi, film ke khamoshi athwa silence jaise purv sheershakon ke bare main media rapaten kahati hai ki kahani gambheer tathaa andheri he
 According to Basu, he used these comedies as a tribute to the physical comedy inspired by the silent films of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin
 nirdeshak anuraag basu ne film main ranbir kapur ko lene kaa nirnay patakatha likhnaa armbh karne se purv hi le liya tha or uske vaachak ke rup main katrina caff pehali pasand thi
 In March 2010, The Times of India reported that Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif had been selected for the lead roles in the film and the title was silently followed by the title being changed to silence, Basu also confirmed
 basu svaparayan ladki kaa abhinay nibhaane ke liye kolkata se ek nayi ladki ko film main lenaa chaahate the
 Basu's wife suggested Chopra's name for the performance
 parantu basu ko ashanka thi ki darshak prasiddh abhinetri hone ke naate "priyanka chopra" ko dekhenge paatr ko nahin
 Basu said, "I was afraid that i would be seeing Priyanka Chopra as the character of Jhilmil and it would not be possible to portray the Jhilmil character properly
 yah bahut filmon ke saath ho chukaa he jahaan gyaat chehre ne paatr ko nuksaan pahunchaaya he
 "priyanka Chopra played some part but it was not announced as Basu first wanted to work on it and see how it goes
 teen din kii kaaryshaala ke pashchaat, aashwast ho gayi ki chopra svaparayan ladki kaa abhinay kar sakati hai tathaa pratibimbit kiya ki wo khush hai ki unhone priyanka ko is abhinay ke liye chunaa
 Later, Basu stated directly that he did not urge anyone other than Chopra to act as Swaparayan
 film main chopra kaa chayan karne ke baad kaiff ne agyaat kaarnon se yojana ko chhod diya
 The media reported that Chopra may have opted out of the film due to the strong acting part
 baad main, media ne prativedit kiya ki asin ne caff ke sthaan par vaachak ke abhinay ke liye prastaav rakhaa tha
 Although Asin never opted for an offer in the film
 media rapaton ke anusaar koi bhi anya abhinetri film main abhinay nahin karnaa chaahati kyonki unke anusaar svaparayan bhaag bahut majboot he
 In July 2010, Mumbai Mirror wrote that Chopra is ready to act as a reader and is skipping Swaprayan's acting, so other actresses may be scheduled for the film; Chopra does not want the film to stop
 basu ne film ke vikaas kii pushti kii or kaha, "yah satya he ki ham anya bhaag kaa paatr-nirdhaaran karne main asamarth rahe hai
 "after facing many problems related to character determination, Basu chose a completely new face to act for another female character
 disambar 2010 ke purvarddh main eliana di'cruge ko vaachak evam kapur ke pehle pyaar kii dwitiya pramukh mahila abhinay ke liye chunaa gaya
 Ranbir Kapoor acted as a deaf and dumb man in the film
 ranbir ke anusaar, unhone screen kinvadantiyon jaise academy award vijeta abhinayta, roberto benigni, charlie chaplin or apane pitamah raaj kapur se prerana lee
 Due to the physical disability of the protagonist, Basu did not want to use any sign language, but the film uses some practical patterns
 kapur ne apane paatr kaa varnan karte hue kaha ki vah ek mastamaula or achche dil vaala aadmi he
 His father Rishi Kapoor has a different view of Ranbir's performance in the film
 unke anusaar - "unhen ek actor ke taur par ranbir kii filmein pasand nahin aatin, kyonki mujhe usamen abhi wo baat nahin najar aati he, jo ek behtareen actor main dikhti hai
 " priyanka chopra ne jhilmil kaa abhinay kiya he
 According to Basu, Chopra's acting was the most difficult part of the film
 apni bhoomika ke liye taiyaari karne ke liye chopra vibhinn maansik sansthaaon main gayin or svaparayan logon ke saath samay bitaayaa
 He says that he did research on acting because there is very little awareness of autism in India
 chopra ne bataaya ki ek hindi film nayika ke rup main shaayad unhen har avrodh kii sambhaavna kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 She mentioned that she needed two moments to become flabbergasted as she could not understand her character due to differences in her thinking and behavior
 di'cruge, jinhone vaachak ke rup main kahani bayaan kii he or film ke pramukh purush paatr kaa pratham pyaar kaa abhinay karti hai, kahati hai, "shruti, abhinay ke liye aise samvedansheel bhoomika he jaise ki vah film main ek anya hi charan main chali jaati he
 "according to Basu, the character of Inspector Dutta starring Saurabh Shukla is the most important after the characters of Kapoor, Chopra and d'cruz
 basu ne is paatr ko ko "adbhut" bataate hue varnan kiya he ki jab vah hansataa he to baaki paatro ko ronaa aa jaataa he
 Major photography began in March 2011
 barfi! kaa filmakan mukhya rup se darjeeling main june 2011 or farvari 2012 ke madhya kiya gaya
 In March 2011, Basu traveled to Kolkata to determine the location of filming in the city
 mumbai main filmakan 20 march 2011 ko armbh hua or may 2011 tak chalaa
 In June 2011, the hero heroine and other co-workers shot the film in Darjeeling
 disambar 2011 main, kuch drishy kaafii dur coimbatore, mukhya rup se polachi or uti main filmaaye gayi
 The scenes in which Kapoor's acting character is chased by a policeman on the roof were shot at the end of January 2012 in Kolkata
 chopra ke kuch vishesh drishyon ko chhodkar film kii shooting april 2012 tak purna hui
 The producers postponed the film's release date to July 13, until August 31, 2012, as shooting had not been completed in September 2011 and was awaiting filming
 basu ne eliana ke dabing ansh par april 2012 ke ant main hi kaary karnaa armbh kar diya tha kyonki di'cruge hindi bhashaa ke saath sahaj nahin thi or filmaane ke dauraan siikhnaa chaahati thim

 According to De, the narrative verse of the Rigveda is in fact a mythological and Nijandhari narrative
 yask ne nirukt main sarama panees kii katha ko aakhyaan kaha he
 Due to the analogy of both "narratives" and Sanskrit "narratives", perhaps some scholars of Hindi have been trying to apply the classical character of "narrative" over "narrative"
 kintu sanskrit ke lakshanshasthron main paraspar kuch aise moulik virodh vartmaan hai ki unhen ek duusare kaa samanarthak nahin mana ja saktaa
 In Sanskrit, there was also a prose composition of the category of the legend, which was called 'katha'
 bhamah ne kaavyalankar main sundar gadhy main rachit saras kahani ko "aakhyayika" kaha he
 It was divided into sorrows and in this the hero himself used to describe his circle and efforts
 bich-bich main vaktra or apavaktra chand aa jate the, jabaki katha main vaktra or apavaktra chand nahin hote the, na hi iskaa vibhaajan uchhvaason main hota tha
 Shri Parashuram Chaturvedi has written that the characteristic of "akhayika" is found in the fact that it is said by some person himself, due to which many of his things become self-respecting
 premakhyanwaale "aakhyaan" shabd kaa mul arth bhi kisi aisi visheshta kii hi ore sanket karata janaa padataa he
 The significance of the "mahabharata" and "ramayana" being called "narratives" will probably also lie in the fact that their authors, Vyas and Valmiki, had written the things they had seen and heard, they do not have the same part of the imagination, It is often considered necessary in the relationship
 aakhyaan shabd ko isi kaaran apekshaakrit adhik "vrittantaparak" or tadnusaar vishuddh bhi kah sakate hai
 Therefore, the use of the word "love" in the original form of Premkahani as being basically similar to "apabiti" should be considered as appropriate
 uparyukt panktiyon main chaturvedi ji ne sidhe na kahkar kathanalaghav ke madhyam se aakhyaan ko aakhyayika kaa sadrusharthak siddh karne kaa praytn kiya he
 At another site, too, but more clearly, he reiterates the same, that the word "narrative" from "premodern" seems to be basically an adaptation of the narrative
 "" If it is absolutely necessary to give a story to a narrative noun, that its author has "seen and heard" the story itself, then no such evidence or evidence is available in the context of Ramayana and Mahabharata that on the basis of this, he is assured Live that their authors wrote everything they themselves "saw and heard"
 saath hi "dekha suna" pad kya apane main aspasht evam anishchit arth kaa dyotak nahin he? astu, ramayana evam mahabharat ko "aakhyaan" naam dene kaa avashya hi koi doosraa kaaran rahaa hoga
 Of all the narrative texts from Vedic literature to Hindi literature, or which are considered narrative texts, only one can be "relatively more chronological and accordingly correct", the rest is speculative
 katha or aakhyaanak granthon kii to baat hi kya, charitagranthon or charitakaavyon tak main kalpana ne itihaas ko buree tarah aakraant kar rakhaa he
 Dr
 Shambhunath Singh has considered the development of dance, music and narrative from the original folk songs
 aage chalakar unhone yah bhi kaha he ki in aakhyaanon kaa vastutatv puranic, nisandhri, samasamyik tathaa kalpit; in chaar prakaar ke paatro, ghatnaon or paristhitiyon ko lekar gathit hua he
 Pt
 Hazari Prasad Dwivedi has also considered the narrative as a folklore distinct from the narrative, as in "another section of the general public, which did not have a place of religion, which was directly driven by the western form of apostolic literature, which was in the villages
 Plotting and anthem was going on in meetings, being neglected
 in sufi saadhakon ne puranic aakhyaanon ke badale hue lokprachlit kathankon kaa aashray lekar hi apni baat janata tak pahunchaai
 "" Actually, because of proving the narrative to be a narrative, Chaturvedi ji had to say all the above
 itnaa hi nahin, bhamahakaalin "aakhyayika" ke is lakshan-usamen nayak apane vrutt tathaa cheshtaa kaa varnan swayan karata tha-ko aakhyaan par ghataane ke liye unhen "prem kahani ke mul rup main aapbeetee jaisi" bhaavana kii clisht kalpana tak kerani padi
 Literature is a constant dynamic
 at: vah uganuroop apni vidhaon main parivartan, parivardhan, sanshodhan tathaa parishkar karata chalata he or lakshan saahitiyik vidhaon ko lekar hi nishchit kiye jate hai, unpar jabardastee ghataae nahin ja sakate
 That is why after Bhamah, Dandi in the poetry has considered the story and the story to be the same category of compositions, saying that the story should be told by the hero or someone else, whether the chapter is divided or not, the chapters should be named sarcasm or long, text in between
 Whether or not the impure verses come, there is no difference in the story
 at: in upree bhedon ke kaaran "katha" or "aakhyayika" main antar karnaa chahie
 In the ninth century, Acharya Rudrat even went so far as to say on the basis of the then prevalent literature that there is a bound to write prose only for Sanskrit-bound stories; But compositions written in other languages can also be written in verse
 yahan "anya bhashaaon" se praakrit or apbhransh kii ore ishaara kiya gaya he
 It is, therefore, proven that the standards of literary genres change as well
 dandi ne bhi katha or aakhyayika ke antargat samast aakhyaan jati ko antarbhukt mana he, yatha- Therefore, it is clear that in the time of Dandi, the narrative was a caste word
 mahabharat main anek aakhyaanon evam upakhyanon kaa sankalan he, isliye ise aakhyaankavy kaha gaya hoga
 This may have been the reason for naming the Ramayana as narrative
 hindi main "aakhyaan" shabd praaia: saadhaaran katha yaa vrittant ke rup main hi prayukt hota he
 That is why all poetry verses are available under stories of poetry, stories, charities, talks, dohas, chaupai or chaupai, raas etc
 aakhyaanon kii satta kaa pramaan rugveda kii samhita main hi hamen uplabdh hota he
 History and Purana are mentioned in the Atharvaveda not as oral literature but as written texts
 vedon kii vyaakhyanpranali ke vibhinn sampradaayon main yask ne aitihaasikon ke sampradaay kaa anek baar ullekh kiya he jinke anusaar "vrutra" tvaashtra asur kii sangya he or devon ke adhipati indra ke saath uske ghor sangharsh or tumul sangram kaa varnan rugveda ke mantron main kiya gaya he
 In the opinion of the interpreters of this sect there are significant narratives in the Vedas
 rugveda main aakhyaanon kii sankhya kam nahin he
 Some of these narratives are about the individual deity and some tend to target some collective event
 rugveda main indra tathaa aswin ke vishay main bhi anek aakhyaan milte hai jinamein in devon kii veerta, parakram tathaa upkaar kii bhaavana spasht ankit kii gai he
 Within the Rigveda, 30 verses are explicitly instructed, out of which some eminent legends are - Shun, Shep, Agastya and Lopamudra, Grutsamad, Vasistha and Vishvamitra, the incarnation of Soma, the triune and Vrishajan, the birth of Agni, the birth of Shyavash, Jupiter
 , Raja Sudas, Nahusha, Appala, Nabhanedistha, Vrishakapi, Urvashi and Pururava, Sarma and Pani, Devapi and Shantanu, Nachiketa,
 inke atirikt danstutiyon main anek raajaaon ke naam uplabdh hai jinase daan paakar anek rishiyon ko unki stuti main mantra likhane kii prerana mili
 There are also clear signs in these hymns towards certain narratives
 rugveda se bhinn vaidic granthon main bhi aakhyaanon kaa vivaran diya gaya he
 Some of these narratives are quite new, but some are only modified forms of the narratives indicated in the Rigveda
 rugveda se sambhddha "anukramani sahitya" main, visheshat: brihaddevataa or sarvanukramani main, nirukt, nitimanjari or sayan bhashya main in aakhyaanon ko vistrut ghatnaon kaa bhi varnan hua he
 These narratives are also described in the Puranas, but their incidence is seen at some places and at some places the definition is visible
 brahman tath shrautasutra bhi inke vikaas ke adhyayan ke liye aavashyak saamagree prastut karte hai
 For example, the narrative of Sobhari Karma, which is indicated in many Suktas of the Rigveda, is described in detail in the Bhagavata
 shyavashv aatreya kaa aakhyaan rugveda main ullikhit hone ke atirikt sankhyayan shrotsutra main bhi nirdisht he
 The narratives of Chyavan Bhargava and Sukanya Manvi are mentioned in detail in the many suktas of the Rigveda in detail in the Tandya Brahmana, the Nirukta, the Shatapatha Brahmin and the Srimad Bhagavata Purana
 is prakaar vaidic aakhyaanon ke vikaas kii vipul saamagree ramayana, mahabharat or puraanon ke bheetar rochak vistaar ke saath uplabdh hoti he
 There are substantial differences among scholars regarding the answer to the question of what the narratives mean
 amareeki vidvan dow bluemfield ne un vidwaanon ke mat kaa khandan kiya he jinhone in aakhyaanon kii rahasywaadee vyakhya prastut kii he
 These mystic scholars, for example, see a serious mystery within the narrative of Pururava
 unki drushti main pururava surya or urvashi ushaa he
 The mutual combination of Usha and Surya is momentary
 unke viyog kaa kaal bada hi deergh hota he
 On being disconnected, the sun travels throughout the day in search of Usha, then somewhere, then on the second day in the morning there is a meeting of both
 pracheen bharat ke vaidikon kii vyakhya kaa yahi rup tha
 But depriving the narratives of their human value does not seem to be just and appropriate
 in aakhyaanon ke anushilan ke vishay main do tathyon par dhyaan dena aavashyak he : The teaching of the narratives is for the collective welfare of human society and the promotion of the world universe
 bhartiya samskruti ke anusaar maanav or dev donon paraspar sambhddha hai
 Man makes sacrifices in the yagyas to the Gods, who fulfill his desire with happiness and continue to pour their offerings on them
 indra tathaa aswin vishyak aakhyaan iske vishad drushtaant hai
 Indra is overjoyed by having the Somaras given by Yajaman and makes his wish successful
 avarshan ke daitya ko apane vajra se chhin-bhinn kar ve sab nadiyon ko pravaahit karte hai
 Humans are resistant to rain
 sansar main shanti viraajane lagati he
 Kalidasa has expressed this Vedic fact with great beauty
 prayek aakhyaan ke antstal main maanvon ke shikshanarth tathy antarnihit hai
 Apala Atreyi's narrative is a vivid exponent of the sublime and sharpness of the feminine character
 raja tryarun traivrishna or vrushjan kaa aakhyaan ; rugvidhan 12
52; brihaddevataa 5
14
23 vaidic kaaleen purohit kii mahatta or garima kaa spasht sanket karata he
 The narrative of Sobhari Karma demonstrates the importance of consistency
 ushasti chaakrayan kaa aakhyaan ann ke samuhik prabhaav tathaa gaurav kii kamaneey katha he
 The story of Shyavash Atreya expresses the pride of the sage, the glory of love and the sadness of the poet in a very beautiful way
 rigvedic yug kii yah prakhyat pranaykahani he, jisamen prem kii siddhi ke liye shyavashv tapasya ke bal par mantradrashtaa rishi ban jate hai
 The story of Dadhyang Atharvan gives us the glorious teachings of rising above the selfishness and welfare of the nation by teaching our lives for the nation's Mars
 puraana main inhen kaa naam rishi dadhichi he, jinhone vrutra ko maarane ke liye indra ko apni haddiyaan vajra banane ke liye dekar arya sabhyataa kii raksha kii thi
 The odd result of the sermon of mystics to the trespasser is shown in this Vedic narrative
 in sab aakhyaanon ke peeche upadesh he- ishwar main atoot shraddha tathaa maanav se ghanishtha prem
 a description of the characteristic errors and immoral practices of certain sages is also available in the Vedic and the narratives found in the Mahabharata and Puranas that follow them
 e kathanak aniatikta ke gart main girane se bachaane ke liye hi nirdisht hai
 In the Puranas also these narratives are described many times, but they are as varied
 tulanaatmak adhyayan se prathit hota he ki anek aakhyaan kalantar main parivartit manovriti athwa vibhinn saamaajik tathaa dharmik paristhiti ke kaaran apane vishuddh vaidic rup se nitant vikrut rup dhaaran kar lete hai
 In the process of development, several intermittent events also synthesize the narrative and give it a new form, which sometimes proves to be completely against the original narrative
 shun:shape tathaa vasishtha vishwamitra ke kathankon kaa anushilan is siddhant ke pradarshan main drushtaant prastut karata he
 This narrative of Shun: Shep referred to in the Rigveda is available in Aitareya Brahmana in a new form, embodied by new events
 ab yahan yah aakhyaan aarambh main raja harishchandra ke putr rohitashv ke saath tathaa kathant main rishi vishwamitra ke saath sambhddha hokar ek naveen rup dhaaran kar letaa he
 All the events of his other two brothers' power, his father's scalp, his sales, etc
 seem to have been fabricated from the back of the storyline
 "shun:shape" kaa arth bhi kute se koi sambandh nahin rakhata
 "shun" means happiness, well-being and "shep" means pillar or pillar
 at: "shun:shape" kaa arth hi he "soukhya kaa stambh"
 In this way, this story paves the way for welfare, giving the message of freedom from Varun's loop
 vasishtha vishwamitra kaa aakhyaan rugveda main swat: sanketit he
 A
 Both sages were probably priests of King Sudas at different times
 ye us yug ke rishi hai jo chaaturvarnya ke kshetra se baahar mana ja saktaa he
 In both the kingdom of supreme harmony and the spirit of friendship resides
 donon tapasya se put, tej ke punj tathaa alokik shaktishaalee mahapurush hai
 But in the later texts - Ramayana, Purana, Brihaddevata etc
 - a great struggle, disharmony and opposition have been shown between the two
 vishwamitra kshatriya se brahman banane ke liye lalayit or vasishtha ke dwaara angeekrut na hone par unke putron ke vinaashak ke rup main chitrit kiye gaye hai
 Eminent Sections Shun: Shape's narrative appears to be dependent on the true event, with the Rigveda being heavily indicated in many verses
 aitarey brahman main yah aakhyaan bahut vistaar ke saath varnit he, jiske aadi main raja harishchandra kaa or ant main vishwamitra kaa sambandh jodakar ise parivardhit kiya gaya he
 Varuna's grace Ikshvaku Naresh Harishchandra was born, he escaped into the jungle at the time of surrender, Harishchandra received the disease, Shun: Sheep, the middle son of Azigarta on the way, procured him to be saved by the grace of the gods, Incidents such as the making of Kritakaputra by Vishwamitra, etc

 The more points a player controls, the more resources they gain
 yah avadharana ek khilaadi ke kshetra ke nirantar vistaar kii maang karti he
 These points are connected to the supply lines etc
 and therefore during the fight a player can isolate the rest and occupy one point of the supply line, which is connected to the base through it and thus reduces the enemy's resources Huh
 khilaadi teen sansadhano kaa sangrah karte hai: maanavshakti, hathiyaar or eendhan

 However, it also has benefits; The infantry are well protected from small arms and most of the buildings are so strong that they can stand for long periods of time before falling to the tank
 In addition, the Company of Heroes, which is mildly involved with the theme of buildings collapsing, is one of the first games based on World War II strategy to introduce dynamic building destruction, which exploited the physics engine used for the game
 For example, if a tank concentrates its shelling at one place near the floor of a building, then the entire building will first collapse in that specific area and later the rest of the building will collapse
 kabja kiye hue bhawanon ko dushman kii ikaayiyon kii firing yaa kisi anya ke hamale ke baad top ke golon yaa dhvansaatmak hamale se nasht kiya ja saktaa he

 If two parents who are carriers have a child, there is a 4-in-1 chance that their child will have the disease and a 2-in-1 chance that their child is just a carrier
 Since this gene is incompletely diarrheal, carriers may produce only a few red blood cells with sickles, which will not be sufficient to cause symptoms, but are sufficient to give resistance to malaria

 Due to the favorable advantage of heterogeneous zygote, the disease is still prevalent among people, especially in the Middle East and Mediterranean regions, such as in malaria stricken areas with recent Africa, India
 Malaria was a historical endemic of southern Europe, but it was declared century, with the rare exception of sporadic cases in the mid-20th eradication

 Sickle cell anemia is caused by a point mutation in the β-globin chain of hemoglobin, whereby the hydrophilic amino acid glutamic acid is replaced by the sixth with the hydrophobic amino acid line

 The actual anemia of this disease is due to blood degeneration, destruction of red cells inside the spleen due to their malformation
 Although the bone marrow attempts to compensate by creating new red blood cells, it does not reach the destruction rate
 Healthy red blood cells typically live for 90–120 days, but sickle cells only live for 10–20 days

 Kunal was the son of Emperor Ashoka and Rani Padmavati
 divyavdaan ke ashokadaan or kunaladaan main kunal ke jivan se sambandhit anek kahaniyaan hai
 The most well-known story is that Ashoka had a queen Tishirakshita, who was very young and very lustful by nature
 kunal kii sundar aankhon par mugdh hokar usne usase pranprastaav kiya
 It was quite natural for his son Kunal to refuse the offer
 par tishyarakshita ise bhula na saki
 When Ashoka fell ill once, Tishirakshita took the promise of getting a mummaga bridesmaid by doing her full service
 takshashila main vidroh hone par jab kunal use dabaane ke liye bheja gaya tab tishyarakshiyata ne apane varan main samraat, ashok kii rajmudra prapthkar takshashila ke mantriyon ko kunal kii ankhen nikaal lene tathaa use maar daalane kii mudrankit ajna likh bheji
 The powerful but reluctant ministers took out the eyes of the popular Kunal but left his life
 ashok ko jab iskaa pataa chalaa to usne tishyarakshita ko dandswaroop jivit jala dene kii ajna di
 But some scholars do not consider this story as historical
 prasiddh vidvan prajiluski ne kunal sutara ke chini roopaantar ko prastut kiya he
 According to this source, there was no rebellion in Taxila
 vastut: kunal vahaan kii janata kii maang par ashok dwaara ek swatantra raja ke rup main niyukt kiya gaya tha
 It is possible that in future, an independent state may have been established in the Gandhara state
 kunal kaa sambandh kashmir or pamirvarti pradeshon se bhi rahaa he jo anek pramaanon se siddh he
 Kunal is also described as Ashoka's successor in some Puranas
 kunal himalay main paye jane vaale pakshiyon me ek he
 Emperor Ashoka, who ruled the whole of India, named his son Kunal over the eyes of this bird
 kunal kaa sanskrit main arth hota he "sundar netron vaala pakshi" or yadi yah kisi vyakti kaa naam he to iskaa arth hota he "vah vyakti jo prtyek vastu me sundarataa dekhtaa ho" athwa "sundar netron vaala vyakti"
 sanskrit main iska ek arth "camel" bhi hota he Ashoka sent his son to Ujjain to prepare him to take over the reins of the Mauryan Empire, where he was brought up and imparted the education of princes
 jab rajkumaar 8 varsh ke hue to samraat nen kunal ke shikshakon ko kunal kii shiksha shuru karne ke liye praakrit bhashaa main ek patr likhaa
 ashok kii ek patni jo chaahati thi ki rajgaddi uske putr ko mili, vahaan upasthit thi
 He read that letter
 usne patr main chupake se 'a' akshar ke upar ek bindu laga diya jisase 'adhiyu' shabd 'andhiyu' main parivartit ho gaya jiskaa arth tha rajkumaar ko andhaa kar diya jaye
 patr ko bina dubaara padhe samraat ne us par muhar laga kar bhej diya
 ujjain ke peshkar ko us patr ko pard kar itnaa dhakka laga ki vah use pard kar rajkumaar ko nahin suna paaya
 Finally the prince himself read that letter and knowing that no one in the Maurya Empire had yet violated the head of the house, he blinded himself with hot bars to not be a bad example
 yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki kunal ko ek vidrohi ke daman ke liye takshashila bheja gaya tha jisamen vah safal bhi ho gayi
 But later Tishyaksha blinded him with deceit
 varshon baad kunal ashok kii sabha main ek sangitajna ke bhesh main pahunche
 He was also accompanied by his wife Kanchanmala
 jab samraat ne unki kala se prasann ho kar unhen puruskrit karnaa chaha to kunal apane asli rup main aa gayi tathaa rajya ke uttaradhikaar kii maang saamne rakhi
 ashok ne khedpurvak yah kehete hue manaa kar diya ki kunal andhe hai
 Kunal then asked for the throne for his son
 When the king asked when he had a son, Kunal replied "samprati" meaning "abhi"
 Thus Kunal's son was named Samprati and though he was only an infant then, he was declared the successor of Ashoka
 ashok ke maranoparant samprati ek shaktishaalee raja bane yah bhi kaha jaataa he ki rajkumaar kunal ne bharat-nepal seemaa par mithila main apana samrajya sthapit kiya tha
 This can be the same place where a village named Kunauli is situated on the banks of river Kosi today
 gaanv kii rangmanch samiti aaj bhi kunal natya kala manch ke naam se jaani jaati he
 Some historical and archaeological evidence also confirms this claim
 kunal ke jivan par 'vir kunal' naam se ek ardh-kalpit chalchitr kaa nirmaan 1925 main kiya gaya tha
 In 1941, a Tamil film named 'ashok Kumar' was also based on Kunal's life

 Europe's society was deeply affected by the immediate industrial revolution and the rise of democracy

 Therefore, he was opposed to conservatives and democracy alike

 But it was impossible to solve the problem of Italy peacefully at this time
 1815 kii vienna kii sandhi ko bhang kiye bina austria ko italy se nahin hataaya ja saktaa tha
 But Europe, fearing the revolution of 1848 AD, did not have the courage to amend the Treaty of Vienna of 1815
 aisa karne se unhen krantikari andolanon ke punarutthan kaa bhay tha
 Hence, the second chapter of Kavur's efforts to free Italy began

 With the support of France, he planned to defeat Austria with military might

 He got support from all the revolutionary organizations like 'carbonari' and 'youth Italy'

 In addition, the military power organization was also started in Piedmantha by following constant pressure

 Subsequently, this concept was changed to demand a separate independent autonomous country called Pakistan for the "muslims of India"

 The first general elections were held in 1936 / 1937 in the first phase of the process of handing over power to the public by the British Raj in the subcontinent, the Muslim League had to be defeated badly and its claim that it was severely demoralized by the Muslims of the subcontinent

 The Muslim League could not gain power in any of the 11 provinces of India
 in paristhitiyon main muslim lig aisa lagata tha, upmahadweep ke raajnneetik dhara se alag hoti ja rahi he
 During this period, the Congress, which for the first time had drunk too much of power, took such measures that fear and threats started taking birth in the hearts of the Muslims
 jaise congress ne hindi ko rashtrabhasha ghoshit kar diya, gaao kshay par pabandi laga di or congress ke tirange ko rashtriya dhvaj kaa darja diya
 With the Muslim League losing power in this case, there was a feeling under its leadership that the Muslim League was deprived of power on the grounds that it called itself the House of Representatives of Muslims
 yahi prarambh bindu tha muslim lig ke netritv main do alag rashtron kii bhaavana jaagrukta ki
 At the same time, the discussion between the British Raj and the Congress on the issue of full transfer of power in return for World War II support broke out and when the Congress split from power, some doors were opened for the Muslim League

 4 days before the meeting, the Din Party of Allama Eastern in Lahore broke a ban and held a military parade, which the police opened fire to prevent

 Due to this incident, there was tremendous tension in Lahore and in Punjab, the Muslim League's ally, the Uniunsat Party was in power and there was a danger that the shin carrier workers of Deen should not allow this meeting of the Muslim League or there is an uproar on this occasion 
 sanyog hi gambhirtha ke maddenjar mohammad ali jinna ne udghaatan satr ko sambodhit kiya jisamen unhone pehali baar kaha ki bharat main samasya sampradayik raarna tarah kaa nahin he balki ben international he yani yah do deshon kii samasya he
 He said that the difference between Hindus and Muslims is so big and clear that their alliance under a central government will be full of dangers
 unhone kaha ki is maamle main ek hi rasta he ki unhen alag mamalakatein hoon
 On the same day, on 23 March, the then Chief Minister of Bengal, Maulvi Kripa Haq, gave a resolution in Lahore, stating that no constitutional scheme would be feasible nor would Muslims have until the geographical units met each other
 Separate singing areas should not be limited
 sankalp main kaha gaya tha ki in kshetron main jahaan musalamaanon kii sankhyatmak bahumat he jaise ki bharat ke uttar pashchimi or purvottar kshetra, unhen sangyojan unhen mukt mamalakatein sthapit kii jaaen jinamein shaamil ikaayiyon ko swaittata or samprabhutaa ucch mil
 The resolution offered by Maulvi Inam-ul was supported by the Muslim Legion leader of UP, Chaudhary Riyalsam, Punjab, Maulana Zafar Ali Khan, Sardar Aurangzeb Sindh from the border, Abdullah Haroon from Sindh and Qazi Isa from Balochistan
 sankalp 23 march ko samaapan satr main paarit kiya gaya
 In April 1941, at the conference of the Muslim League in Madras, the resolution Lahore was included in the party's constitution and it was on this basis that the Pakistan movement started
 lekin phir bhi in kshetron kii spasht pahchaan nahin kii gai thi, jinamein shaamil alag muslim rajyon kii maang kiya ja rahaa tha
 For the first time, areas for Pakistan's demand were identified on 7 April 1946 in a three-day conference in Delhi attended by Muslim Legion members of the Central and Provincial Legislative Assemblies
 is sammelan main britain se aane vaale cabinet mishan ke pratinidhimandal ke saamne muslim lig kii maang pesh karne ke liye ek prastaav paarit kiya gaya tha jiskaa masauda muslim lig kii kaaryakarini ke do sadasyon choudhary riek lsamaan or hasan isohani ne taiyaar kiya tha
 The areas to be included in Pakistan were clearly identified in this Karadad
 purvottar main bengal or assam or uttar pashchim main punjab, seemaa, sindh or baluchistan
 Surprisingly, there was no mention of Kashmir in this resolution although there was a Muslim dominated area in the North West and annexed to Punjab

 Perhaps few people know that the original draft of Sankalp Lahore was prepared by Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, the then UNIANSUT Chief Minister of Punjab
 uninst party us jamaane main muslim lig main ekikrut ho gai thi or sir sikandar hayaat khan punjab muslim lig ke adhyaksh the
 In the original draft resolution, the head Sikandar Hayat Khan proposed almost a central government on the basis of a central government in the subcontinent, but when the draft was considered in the Muslim League Subject Committee, quaid-e-azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah himself mentioned the only central government in this draft

 He said that he was strongly opposed to the distribution on the basis of Hindu Raj on the one hand and Muslim Raj on the other hand in India and he would fight against their destructive distribution in such a manner
 magar aisa nahin hua
 Sir Sikander Hayat Khan died the second year in 1942, at the age of 50, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah got freedom from Hisar in Punjab due to intense opposition

 lekin jab pakistan kii samvidhan sabha samvidhan set karegi to vah is samasya ke antim madhyasth hogi or yah do alag rajyon ke gathan ke faisle kaa puraa adhikaar hoga
 But the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan did not consider the establishment of two independent and autonomous states of Muslims in the subcontinent neither in quaid-e-azam life nor when the country's first constitution was passed in 1956

 | Shivanand Goswami was the exclusive seeker and power-worshiper of tripura-sundari

 After Shrimad Bhagwat, Shivanand Goswami is credited with writing the most prolific text singh-siddhanta-sindhu
 " Among the great men whose contribution to the creation of India's glorious and varied cultural-history has been memorable - among them the strong culture of seventeenth-century Telang Brahmin, philosopher-poet tantra-chudamani Shivanand Goswami as a strong link to the long scholarly tradition of Andhra Pradesh
 And literary contribution is very important
 According to the description of the North Indian andhra-tailang-bhatt-family tree, "in the Atreya gotra of the Tailang Brahmins, there was the original ancestor Srivayenkatesha Ananamma in the Taittriya Aastambha of the Yaturveda" - in whose sixth generation was born in the family of Jagannivasji such a remarkable scholar as Shivanand Goswami

 shivanand goswami apane yashasvi pita ke do anya putron-shri janardan goswami or shrichakrapani se bade the
 Historical Sanskrit texts - 'muhurtratna' and 'sanheda Aryasaptashti' have some kind of 'kavitamya' introduction of the Dravidian clan of Shivanand - "panampatta on the banks of the holy river Penna, destroying all sins in the 'dravidian' region in the south of India
 In the family of Atreya gotra residing in the city, he was a scholar of knowledge of Agam Nigam Mystery and veda-vedang / Gon, who was a scholar
 Many scholars of the time had 'defeated' them and received their discipleship
 Jagannivasji, who was born in this family of Yashopataka of the same Atreya clan, spread across rivers and seas, was invited by the King of Bundelkhand and received 'initiation' from them
 The king became his disciple
 The same great scholar Jagannivasji had three sons - Srisiromani Bhatt, Sreejanardan and Srichakrapani
 " 'saheeda Aryasaptashati' shivanandji ke pitamah shri shrinivas bhatta dakshin se aaye the
 In his youth, he took the initiation of Tantrashastra and 'srividya' from Deshikendra Sachchidananda Sundaracharya, a Manish of the Dravidian region, who was the ruler of jalandhar-peetha - the Guru then gave him the title of 'goswami' in Samvat 1630
 diksha ke uparaant inkaa nayaa naam goswami vidyanandnath padaa| lalita kii archa main, shrividya main nirat ho jane se inhen kaa teesraa naam lalitanandanath goswami bhi he
 Therefore, among these Atreyya Brahmins from Telangana, 'goswami' is not a caste word, a title given to scholarship
 iske tees varsh baad main, samvath 1660 main mahaprabhu vallabhacharya ke yogya putr gusaain shri vitthalanath ji ko bhi akbar ke ek farmaan se 'goswami' kii jo oopaadhi mili vah aaj tak apane naam ke saath pushtimaarg ke sampradaay ke acharya or unke vanshaj lagaate hai
 ) In this way, 'goswami' surname became popular in different contexts for both the Mathurastha and gokulastha-telang-brahmins

 daily statement in sab granthon main 'singh-siddhant-sindhu' visan1731 aisi kaaljayi rachana he, jiskaa apane samakaleen-sanskrit-granthon main koi sani nahin he
 The number of original shlokas composed in this is shocking
 singh-siddhant-sindhu main kul 35,130 sanskrit shloke hai joshrimadbhagwat kii kul shloke sankhya se bhi kahin zyada hai
 Bhagwat has 18 thousand verses, 335 chapters and 12 wings
 shrimadbhagwat mahapurana se bada vipul sandarbh saamagree se sanyojit sambhavatya yah apni tarah kaa sabase bada granth he
 Classical texts such as the Srimad Bhagavat Maha Purana and the 'mahabharata' are the result of the combined long-form writing tradition of many sages-scholars, as Ved Vyasa is not the name of a single individual, an 'academic post' assumed by various scholars from time to time
 ) But a single writer has prepared such a huge manuscript, it is rare to find such a unique example in the literary history of Sanskrit
 yah kriti anup sanskrit librari, bikaner main pandulipi kii prati hone ke baavjood vidwaanon kii drushti se anek varshon tak luptpraaya rahi or iskaa prakaashan lekhan ke praayah chaar sau saal baad sambhav hua par saubhaahgya se yah ab sulabh he

 Handwritten copies of some of his compositions are also in the Pothikhana of Jaipur as mentioned in this list
 yadhyapi prakaash parimal jaise anusandhankartaaon ne shivanand ji kaa janm vikram samvath 1710 ankit kiya he, tathaapi unki laghu-pustak main is tathy ke sakshya kaa koi pramaan uplabdh nahin hota
 The truth is that in which year and where he was born, it is a matter of research
 is kaa kaaran keval yah he ki puraane jamaane main mahaan se mahaan lekhak tak apane nijee-jivan ke bare main koi soochna yaa jaankaree apni kritiyon main aksar nahin dete the
 In that era, to remain completely secret or unaware and to engage in high level silent saraswat-sadhana would have been the internal psychopathy of many scholars like Shivanand ji
 aisa anumaan bahuprachlit he ki anek nareshon ke sammanit kulguru hone ke baavjood, apana antim samay goswamiji ne bikaner ke maharaja anupasingh ke aagrah par unke saath hi vyateet kiya
 But where Shivanand Goswami died - somewhere in South India, or in Bikaner - is a matter of research
 shivanand goswami chanderi ke governor devisingh bundela ke samakaleen the, jinhone goswamiji se 'mantra-diksha' lekar bhent main kuch gaanvon kii jaagir bakshi thi
 Similarly, the seventh generation king of Orchha, Devi Singh, was impressed by his scholarship and gave a jagir of 4 villages
 jaipur raja vishnusingh ne san 1692-1694 isvi main inhen ramjipura, harivanshpura, chimanpura or mahapura graamon kii jaagir bhent kii thi, jiskaa pramaan jaipur ke pothikhana ke abhilekh main aaj bhi surakshit he
 Today Mahapura village has become a part of the Jaipur metropolis, which is situated on Ajmer road, 10 km from Jaipur
 mahapura main goswami ji ke or unke bhai janardan goswami ke vanshaj pidiyon tak nivas karte rahe
 It was here that in 1922, the famous Sanskrit litterateur Bhatt Mathuranath Shastri was married to Ramadevi Bhatt, the daughter of Acharya Gopikrishna Goswami of Srimad Bhagwat, a descendant of Shivanandji
 bikaner ke maharaja anup singh dwaara goswamiji ko do gaanvon - pulasar or chilkoi kii jaagir bhent kii gai thi
 He stayed in Bikaner in the evening of his life
 sambhawatah inkaa dehavsaan bhi vahiin hua ho- kintu inke antim dinon ke bare main koi aitihaasik saamagree uplabdh nahin hoti| After Shivanand ji, his sons also continued to achieve many achievements in royalty, keeping their clan tradition intact, as evidenced by the following English document- 'maharaj shri Shivanandji, sole ascendant, gave purnabhishek-mantra to Maharaja Shri Anoop Singh ji Bahadur of Bikaner at Dilsuri 
 The Maharaja bequeathed two villages CHIKLOI and POOLASAR in Bhent on this most auspicious occasion to Shri Shivanandji Maharaj, the Rajguru
 Thus Goswami Paramsukhji Maharaj, the youngest son of great Shri Shivanandji Maharaj settled at Bikaner on the request of HH Shri Gajsingh ji Bahadur,the Maharaja of Bikaner
 Shri Suratsinghji, Maharaja of Bikaner also accepted Purnabhishek Mantra from Goswami Shri Paramsukhji Maharaj, the Rajguru, in 1855 AD and bequeathed the village KHETOLAI in Bhent and bequeathed on the most auspicious occasion of the sacred thread ceremony of Bishwnathji and kanhaiyalalji, real sons of shri Paramsukhji Goswami, village SURJANSAR devisingh ke darbari vidvan unke viruddh anek prakaar ke pravaad unki anupasthiti main bana kar raja ke kaan bharte rahete the| yah baat to sarvavidit thi ki orchha yaa bundelon ke isht devtaa, bhagwaan ram the or isi kaaran is kshetra main anek ram or hanuman mandiron kii sthapana bhi hui he, vaise orchha main hi bundelon ke isht hanumanji kaa ek mandir aaj bhi he| yah mandir shivanandji ke ashram or devisingh ke mehalon ke bich padataa tha
 The scholars of Shivanand complained to the king that the temple of the presiding deity of Bundelkhand, while on the way, never bowed down to his guru, the presiding deity
 When King Devisingh himself presented the same thing in front of them, he avoided it in humor, saying that "this matter is of personal reverence and since i am absorbed in the feeling of Ahornish Devi, therefore going into the 'other' sense in it Mine and yours will be evil! All gods are the form of God anyway
 

 " inke uttar se raja kadaachit puri tarah santusht nahin ho sakaa
 So once both of them were coming through the path of the same Hanuman temple, the king begged them to bow down to their favorite Hanuman
 kehete hai- jaise hi shakti ke param aradhak shivanandji ne apane haath pranaam hetu uthaae, usase purv hi hanumanji kii murti main pathar fatne kii awaz ke saath upar se neeche tak ek gahari daraar pads gayi! raja is chamatkaar se bahut bhaybheet ho gaya
 And since then, a deep loyalty to Adyashakti has also awakened in his mind
 orchha main hanuman mandir main aaj bhi vah gahari daraar dekhi ja sakati he
 


 After this incident, Shivanand Goswami's mind became somewhat unsympathetic to the learned politicians and devout politicians in the court on the strength of miracles
 unhone "sankshep-praayshchitt" or "vyavhaar-nirnay" jaise granth likh kar apane isht ke samaksh praayshchitt kiya
 


 " aurangzeb shashan ke dauraan amer ke rajya par aaye rajnatik-sankaton ke nivaaran ke liye jaipur ke tatkaaleen panditon ne maharaja vishnusingh ko nagar main shanti banaaye rakhane ke liye 'vaajapeya-yajna' karwaane kaa mashvira diya tha
 Then some pandits of Kashi and Mithila were very famous for their cultivation and siddhis
 amer ke naresh ne unhen hi is kaam ke liye jaipur aamantrit kiya
 But whenever there was a veela of Purnahuti in that royal Vajpayee-yajna due to misuse, the sacrificial priest would die accidentally
 This happened many times, not once
 ek ke baad ek kaashi-mithila ke paanch siddh purohit yajna puraa karaane se purv hi kaal-kavlit ho gaye
 Seeing such a terrible vengeance, the king sent a message through Bikaner King Anupsinh to Orchha Maharaj that he should kindly send his vice-chancellor and the great Tantric Shivanandji to Jaipur so that he can get the vajpayee-yajna done
 Shivanand Goswami finally reached Amer in 1680 AD and near the Jalmahal, he completed the vajpayee-yajna of Jaipur King uninterrupted
 The night before Purnahuti, it is said that a formidable Brahmarakshas appeared before Goswamiji in a dream - who challenged him to debate with the information that the earlier five kashi-pandits had become his grasps by defeating him in debate
 goswamiji ne brahmarakshas kii is chunauti ko sweekaar kiya or use shastrarth main haraa kar vaajapeya-yajna purnahuti ke saath vidhivat sampann karaayaa| But to disguise the fact that the first five kashi-pandits had defeated the Brahmarakshas in scripture and become his morsels, the king returned to Mahapura from Amber without any alms from Amber Maharaja
 It is said that when Maharaja Vishnusinh sensed Shivanandji's displeasure, he persuaded himself to reach Mahapura with his son Sawai Jai Singh
 Shivanandji, while making some very accurate predictions about Sawai Jai Singh, instructed the Maharaja that he go to some well-known ritualist Pandit and send Kashi for the 'pratamukti' of Brahmarakshas
 He somewhat unhappily held the Maharaja responsible for the killing of the five Pandits, He would have been advised to get Ashwamedha Yagya done as a result of citing many ancient scriptures
 Being distressed by the death of innocent Brahmins, he also showed humility in front of Maharaja in Mahapura and reluctance to stay
 Goswamiji eventually left the estate of five villages with his younger brother to Maharaja Anoop Singh as the Rajguru of Bikaner "after some time" - whose invitation / request to be Bikaner vice-chancellor-rajguru has been pending with him ever since

 Wilhelm II or William II was the last emperor of Germany and king of Prussia who ruled the German Empire and Prussia from 15 June 1888 to 9 November 1918
 wiliam pratham kii mrityu ke uparant uskaa putr fadrik tritiy germany ke rajsinghaasana par 9 march 1888 i
 ko asin hua
 But he died after ruling for only 100 days
 uski mrityu hone par uskaa putr wiliam dwitiya rajya singhaasana par asin hua
 He was a young man
 usamen anek gunon or durgunon kaa sammishran tha
 He was sharp-witted, ambitious, confident and an extraordinary young man
 vah swaarthee or ghamandi tha tathaa uskaa vishwaas raja ke daivi siddhant main tha
 It was unbearable for him to be in control of any other person, due to which he became estranged from his Chancellor Bismarck after a few days
 paristhitiyon se baadhya hokar bismark ko tyaag-patr dena padaa
 After the fall of Bismarck, William took all power into his own hands and his ministers became obedient servants and he became the helm of his own rule
 wiliam kaisar atyadhik hathi, mahatvakankshi evam krodhi vyakti tha
 He used to say that our future depends on the sea
 uske germany ko samudri shakti banane ke prayaas ne england kii sthaayee shatruta praapt kar lee thi
 His policy was- 'to establish his dominion over the whole world
 ' yadi isamen use safalataa na mili to vah vishwa ke sarvanaash ke liye tatpar tha
 England was not in favor of war as a trading country, which William Kaiser considered England's cowardice
 vah akramak ruukh apanaakaar england ko bhaybheet kar apane samrajya kaa vistaar karnaa chahta tha or yah galat samaj thi ki england kisi bhi keemat par yuddh taalna chahega
 Thus William Caesar's fiery, imperialist, autocratic and autocratic personality put Europe on the brink of a great war
 kaisar wiliam dwitiya kii vishwa niti ke nimnlikhit teen mukhya uddeshy the - In order to fulfill the above objectives, Kaiser William II began to conduct Germany's 'foreign policy'
 pratham uddeshy ke kaaran austria ke saath ghanisht mail aavashyak tha, kyonki vah bhi usee disha main bad kar selonika ke bandargah par adhikaar karnaa chahta tha
 This meant strengthening the diplomatic group of Central Europe
 austria or rus ke hiton main sangharsh hone ke kaaran iskaa arth rus se alag hatana or ant main use apana virdohi bana lenaa bhi tha
 The fulfillment of the second objective meant 'to demonstrate the power of Germany wherever necessary in the world, especially in Africa
 ' is sambandh main morocco ne france ko do baar 1905 i
 or 1911 i
 main chunauti di
 a clear result of the fulfillment of the third objective was intense competition and disharmony with England
 saransh main is nai niti kaa swaabhaavik parinaam hona tha, rus, france or england kii shatruta or ant main in teenon kaa uske mukaable main ekatrit ho janaa, arthath bismark ke samast kaary kaa vinaash
 William II destroyed his entire system with his policy
 teen varsh ke andar rus germany se alag ho gaya or baad main france se sandhi karke usne uske ekaakipan kaa ant kar diya
 England became an enemy within 6 years
 morocco main hastkshep karne sefrance se shatruta or bad gai or 1907 i
 tak germany, austria tathaa italy ke trigut ke mukaable main france, rus or england kii trirashtra maitri sthapit ho gai
 Italy's relationship with threesome was also getting relaxed, but William II did not make any effort in this direction
 1890 i
 main punaraashwaasan sandhi kii punrariti hone vaali thi jo bismark dwaara germany or rus main hui thi, jabaki wiliam rus kii apeksha austria se sudrudh sambandh sthapit karnaa chahta tha jissevah balkan main hokar purvi bumadhyasaagar ko apane prabhaav kshetra main laane main safal ho sake
 Russia also refused a repeat of this repatriation treaty, stating that "the treaty is very complex and there is a threat to Austria, which can have disastrous consequences"
 ' The apparent consequence of the non-recurrence of the Treaty of Resettlement was that Russia remained alone
 usko apane ekaakipan ko dur karne ke liye ek mitra kii khoj kerani anivaary ho gai
 Now England and France were his enemies in front of him
 kintu apni paristhiti se baadhya hokar vah france se mitrataa karne kii ore aakarshith hua or usase mitrataa karne kaa praytn karne laga
 Finally, in 1895 AD, the treaty took place in both the countries, which is known as the Dwight Treaty
 is sandhi se france ko atyadhik laabh hua or uskaa akelaapan samaapt ho gaya
 William was very ambitious
 vah germany ko europe kaa bhagya-nirmaataa hi nahin, varan vishwa kaa bhagya-nirmaataa bananaa chahta tha
 Bismarck wanted to keep Germany apart from world conflicts, but William started interfering in conflicts outside of Europe
 vah keval balkan prayadweep main hi german-prabhaav se santusht nahin tha, varan vah to usko vishwa-shakti ke rup main dekhnachahta tha
 For this purpose, world-wide policy was incorporated in Germany's foreign policy after 1890 AD
 wiliam ke anek bhaashanon se uske in vichaaron kaa digdarshan hota he
 He gave these territories in his possession - wiliam turki ko apane prabhaav-kshetra ke antargat laana chahta tha or yah uski vishwa niti kaa ek pramukh ang tha
 England was also trying in this direction
 vah kisi europea raashtra kaa prabhutv turki main sthapit nahin hone dena chahta tha, kyonki aisa hone se uske bhartiya samrajya ko bhay utpann ho saktaa tha
 England was dominated by Turkey until the berlin-congress of 1878, and whenever a European nation thought of making progress towards it, England strongly opposed it, but after the Cyprus agreement, its influence would be less than on Turkey
 felt
 jab england kaa 1882 i
 main misr par adhikaar hua to england or turki ke madhya jo rahi-sahi sadbhaavna vidyaman thi uskaa bhi ant hona aarambh ho gaya
 Now William II took advantage of this situation and tried to bring Turkey into his sphere of influence
 is sambandh main usne nimna upaay kiye- There was also the construction of a rail till Kustuntunia
 is maarg ke khul jane se germany kaa sampark faras kii khadi tak ho jaataa jo england ke bhartiya samrajya ke liye vishesh chintaa kaa vishay ban jaataa
 William must have succeeded in attracting Turkey, but by this policy he made Russia, France and England his enemy, while the power of Turkey was negligible in front of these three big nations
 wiliam kii is niti ko safal niti nahin kaha ja saktaa
 He unhappy the three nations together, as a result of which it was possible to form a three-party faction
 1890 i
 tak germany or england ke sambandh achche the, kintu jab wiliam dwitiya ke shasankaal main germany ne vishwavyaapee niti ko apnaanaa aarambh kiya to germany or england ke sambandh katu honearambh ho gayi
 After Bismarck's resignation, William began to expand in the German navy, England became increasingly suspicious of Germany's growing power
 kuch samay takadonon main maitri kaa haath badha, kintu 1896 i
 ke uparaant donon ke sambandh katu hone aarambh hote gayi
 When William sent a telegram of congratulations to the President of Transvaal, Kruger, conquering James's invasion
 is taar se england kii janata main bada kshebh utpann hua
 Queen Victoria also strongly condemned this work of her grandson William II
 is samay england ne germany se sambandh bigaadna uchit nahin samajha, kyonki aisa karne par vah akelaa rah jaataa
 For this purpose, he tried to establish good relations with Germany
 1898 i
 main africa ke sambandh main tathaa 1899 i
 main senaaon ke sambandh main donon deshon ke samjhaute bhi hue
 In the same year, Joseph Chamberlain, the colonization minister of England, proposed the construction of a ternary in England, Germany and the United States, but in 1899, Beulo, who was then Prime Minister of Germany, did not accept the proposal
 uskaa is prastaav ke asweekaar karne kaa kaaran yah tha ki iske dwaara england kaa aashay yah he ki aagaamee yudhon main germany, england kaa paksh le or uske samarthak ke rup main yuddh main bhaag le or england europea mahadweep se nishcint hokar asia tathaa africa main apane samrajya kaa vistaar karata rahe
 Beulo was of the view that inconvenience to England was inevitable due to Germany's colonial, mercantilist and navigational advancement and could lead to war at both times
 atah germany kii nitiyon dwaara england bhalee prakaar samaj gaya ki germany par adhik vishwaas karnaa england ke liye ghaatak siddh hoga or vastav main ek din aisa avashya aayega jab england or germany kaa yuddh hoga
 Friendship between France and Russia had been established, now the work of friendship between Russia and England started by France
 1907 i
 main france ke praytn se rus or england kaa gut taiyaar ho gaya
 This group was defensive, but the German Emperor William II was greatly worried by its creation
 ab usne apana dhyaan is gut ke ant karne kii ore vishesh rup se aakarshith kiya
 At the same time, Germany had the opportunity to intervene in the eastern problem and humiliate Russia
 1908 i 
 turki main ek aandolan hua jo yuva turk aandolan ke naam se prasiddh he
 Austria soon took possession of Bosnia and Herzegovina
 srbija yah sahan nahin kar sakaa or usne yuddh kii taiyaari karnaa aarambh kar diya
 He hoped that Russia and England would be ready to help him against Austria and Germany, but Russia did not yet have such a situation
 austria ne srbija ke saath bada kathor vyavhaar kiya jiske kaaran yuddh kaa hona anivaary sa dikhne laga, kintu jab germany ne spasht ghoshnaa kar di ki yadi rus srbija kii kisi prakaar se sahaayta karegaa, to vah yuddh main austria kii purna rup se sahaayta karne ko taiyaar he
 Thus the war was averted
 is samay rus main itani shakti nahin thi ki vah germany or austria kii sammilit sevaaon kaa safaltaapurvak saamana kar saktaa
 Russia was forced to subdue and German politics succeeded in the Balkan Peninsula
 yadhyapi german-samraat wiliam kaisar balkan pradesh main rus ko nicha dikhalaane main safal hua or vah apane mitra austria kii shakti kaa vistaar tathaa prabhaav main vruddhi karvaa sakaa, kintu phir bhi vah france, rus or england ke gut se bhaybheet bana rahaa
 He began to move towards befriending France and Russia
 8 farvari 1909 i
 ko usne france se ek samjhauta kiya jiske anusaar france ne morocco kii swatantraaa evam akhandta ke siddhant ko sweekaar kar liya
 Germany accepted France's extraordinary position regarding Morocco's internal security
 idhar nishcint hokar germany ne apana dhyaan rus se samjhauta karne kii ore aakarshith kiya
 Germany signed an agreement with Russia in November 1910 regarding its interests in Mesopotamia and Persia, by which 'russia pledged not to oppose the berlin-baghdad railway plan to Germany, and William acknowledged Russia's interests in Persia
 Of
 ' By the above works, William II succeeded in weakening the faction of Russia, France and England, but this situation could not be sustained for long
 morocco ke prashn kaa samaadhaan karne kaa praytn france or germany dwaara kiya gaya tha, kintu donon samjhaute kii sthiti se santusht nahin the
 There was a natural opposition to the 'independence of Morocco' and the French police power, which was sure to cause a quarrel in the future
 france morocco ko purnataya apane adhikaar main laane par tula hua tha or germany use rokane yaa uske badale main upyukt puraskaar praapt karne par katibaddh tha
 1911 AD In Morocco, an incident occurred which attracted the attention of the major nations of Europe
 morocco main grihayuddh kii agni prajjwalit hui or morocco kaa sultan is vidroh kaa daman karne main asafal rahaa
 After this situation arose, France sent an army, pretending to be responsible for internal security, which started suppressing the rebellion in Morocco on 21 May 1910 AD
 germany france ke is prakaar ke hastkshep ko sahan nahin kar sakaa or germany ke videshmantri ne ghoshnaa kii ki 'yadi france ko morocco main rahanaa aavashyak prathit hua to morocco kii purna samasya par punah vichaar kiya jaayegaa or eljisiraj ke act par hastakshar karne vaali samast sattaaon ko apni icchaanusaar kaary karne kii swatantraaa punah praapt ho jaayegi
 After the suppression of the foreigners, the French forces returned, but even then Germany did not think it necessary to make any changes in its strict behavior
 july 1910 i
 ko germany ne ghoshnaa kii ki usne german hiton tathaa german nivaasiyon kii raksha ke abhipraay se ek jangi jahaaj dakshini morocco ke agedir naamak bandargah par bhej diya
 This behavior of Germany created a very critical situation and it became clear that the possibility of war between the nations of Europe was inevitable soon
 ant main france or german ke madhya sandhi ho gai jo ki 4 navambar 1911 ko sampann hui, jiske anusaar yah nishchay hua ki morocco par france kaa sangrakshan purvawat bana rahe or germany ko french congon kaa aadha pradesh praapt hua
 Germany had to face the question of Morocco, because the three-nation faction of Russia, France and England was now more firm and stable than before and relations between Germany and England started getting worse day by day
