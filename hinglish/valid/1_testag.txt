 ujisi ne kaha he ki uniwarsities model silebus main 30 fisadi tak tabdili kar sakati hai
 On the problems related to teachers, the UGC has made it clear that there will be no inter-institution, inter-college migration transfer of teachers
 isse pehleujisine model silebus main 20 fisadi tak tabdili karne kii baat kahi thi
 Now according to the UGC, up to 30% can be changed according to the specialization in the model syllabus
 jiske badadilli uniwarsitititures association or duusare teachers group ne iske virodh main pradarshan karnaa shuru kar diya tha
 Even the National Democratic Teachers Front had questioned the rationale of the implementation of this system
 duusari taraf kai uniwarsities ne to maanav sansaadhan vikaas mantralay ko bhi iske bare main soochna di thi
 Not only this, the questions were raised on the model syllabus
 ujisike secretary jasapaal es sandhu kaa kahana he ki sibisies ko achche se lagu karne ke liye kamishan ne kai kadam uthaae hai
 For this, eight workshops were organized across the country in which vcs of Central, State and Private Universities participated
 halaat mushkil hai, lekin party jald hi isse ubar jaaegi, congress ko khud ko phir se punerjeevit or parivartit karnaa hoga, ye kahana tha congress ke varisht netaa or purv congress mahasachiv jyotiraditya sindhiya kaa
 He said that Congress President should be given to someone who can strengthen the party with new energy in the party and can take everyone especially with the party worker of the country
 loksabhaa chunaav ke baad pehali baar bhopal aae jyotiraditya sindhiya ne madhyapradesh vidhansabha main media se baatcheet main kaha ki ‘hamane kabhi nahin sochaa tha ki jis rahul gandhi ji ne keval congress kaa hi nahin balki desh ke logon kaa netritv kiya he, ve apane pad ko chhod denge
 On the issue of the party president, he said "time has passed, we will not be able to spend any more time in it
" pehle hi saat saptaah biit chuke hai, sanyukt rup se saath milakar hamen karnaa he
 This is not the time for one Congress man to run his agenda, this is the time to take joint decisions together
 ”gauratlab he ki sindhiya ko AICC adhyaksh niyukt karne kii maang karne vaala ek poster haal hi main bhopal main madhyapradesh congress mukhyalay ke baahar lagaaya gaya tha
 Asked about the future of the Congress after the Lok Sabha elections, Scindia said, "currently the party is going through a serious situation
 logon kaa vishwaas jeetne ke liye congress ko khud ko punerjeevit or majboot karnaa hoga
 i think that moment has come
 ”unhone kaha, ''maine kabhi bhi back foot par ballebaaji nahin kii, balki hameshaa front foot par ballebaaji kii
 The results that have come are the foreheads, i can never abstain from the fact that you were also lacking, if there is no deficiency then why would this result come? pehali javabdehi hamaari honi chaiye
 As far as my results are concerned, i will definitely not lack Jyotiraditya Scindia, i will have to introspect and find flaws
 ''rahul gandhi ke adhyaksh pad se istife par jyotiraditya sindhiya ne kaha, ''congress ke liye ye bada gambhir samay he
 We tried so hard that we could convince them, but if they take a decision, they are adamant
 is baat kaa garv bhi he hamen
 But now it is time
 ab aise shaks ko mauka diya janaa chahie jo congress main nai jaan phoonk sake
 "in Congress, the responsibility should be given to the elderly leader or youth
 On this issue, Scindia said," i am not Modiji, do not divide the population of the country into old and young
 jarurat umr ke bajaay vyaktigat kshamtaaon par dhyaan dene kii he
 But with the passage of time, changes need to happen
 yahaan tak ki ek samay bhi hoga, jab mujhe janaa hoga
 On the resignation of more than a dozen jds-congress alliance mlas in Karnataka and 10 Congress mlas leaving the party in Goa, the Congress leader said the BJP wants to come to power through the back door
 congress netaa ne kaha, ‘‘jahaan tak karnataka kii baat he, goa kii baat he, ye koi nai baat nahin he
 BJP has a straightforward view that wherever they do not get entry through the front door, there should be entry through the back door
 '' congress netaa ne kaha, ‘‘bijepi kaa ek hi lakshya he, ‘sarkaar banaao, mouj karo'
 BJP has nothing to do with the public
 ''congress netaa sindhiya ne kaha ki bijepi pichley chah maheene se madhyapradesh kii chuni hui sarkaar ko giraane kii koshish main he
 He said, "as far as Madhya Pradesh is concerned, it will be like dreaming dream of Mungerilal
 '' empi main party ke vidhayakon ko bijepi kii baat main nahin aane ke liye party ne koi massej vidhayakon ko diya he ke sawaal par congress netaa ne kaha, ‘‘vidhayakon ko internal massej dene kii koi jarurat nahin he
 Our mlas are elected by the public and the mlas understand their responsibilities well
 '' sindhiya ne kaha, ''vidhayak chaahe bijepi ke hon yaa congress ke, main maanata hum ki jo vidhayak chunaa jaataa he vah paripakv he or apni jimmedaari ko acchhee tarah se samajhataa he
 "the question of dominating bureaucracy, he said that neither the minister up nor the bureaucracy up, everyone has to work with team spirit, then only the government will succeed
" naukarshahi or mantriyon ko ek-duusare par haaavee hone kii koshish karne ke bajaay milakar kaam karne kii jarurat he
 The bureaucracy can give new ideas and innovate, but the final decision has to be taken by the ministers
 mukhyamantri sahit koi bhi (naukarshahi yaa mantri) kisi se bhi upar nahin he, lekin team bhaavana ke saath kaam karne kii jarurat he
 On the question of the confrontation of the Scindia faction ministers in the cabinet, Jyotiraditya Scindia said, "it happens in every family
" yah ek swasthy parampara he
 There is no harm to democracy
 prajatantr or majboot hoga
 "every person wants justice, every person wants respect and his voice is heard
 main to maanata hum ye swasth parampara he kya aap aise chaahoge jaise modiji kii sarkaar he jahaan koi kuch naa bol paae
 There is no difficulty in getting every person to speak, but it does not mean that you are not together
 congress saath thi saath he or saath rahegi
 However, the BJP has turned a blind eye to this press conference in the assembly
 pradesh pravaktaa rahu kothaari ne madhyapradesh vidhansabha ke parisar kaa raajnneetik upyog karne par sindhiya ke khilaaf visheshadhikaar hanan kii kaarywahi karne kii maang kii he
 Kothari said that Scindia, a Congress leader who is wandering in hiding after a bitter defeat in the Lok Sabha, is not a member of the assembly
 vah jis tarah khuleam press conference karke madhyapradesh vidhansabha ko apane astitv bachaane kaa akhaada bana rahe hai vah naa keval sanvaidhanik maryaadaaon kaa hanan he balki loktantric vyavastha ke liye atyant durbhagyapurna he
 It is clear from today's incident that the Congress party does not believe in rules and dignities, if the strict action is not taken immediately by the Speaker in this regard, the honorable Governor should also take notice of the suspicious role of the Speaker
 dilli ke mukhyamantri arvind kejariwal ne ravivaar ko kaha ki agar notebandi bhrashtachar or kalaadhan khatm kar de, to vah 'modi-modi' ke naare lagaayenge
 He reiterated his demand that the Prime Minister withdraw this decision, otherwise the country's economy will be ruined
 kejariwal ne kaha ki pradhanmantri ek din main kai baar apane kapade badalte hai, lekin vah logon ko notebandi ke kaaran kabhi-kabhaar tyaag karne kaa pravachan dete hai
 He said, 'workers, farmers and businessmen have been ruined due to demonetisation and people are losing their jobs, but the Prime Minister is busy changing clothes many times
 modi ji aap jo bhi kehete hai, aapako pehle apane upar ise lagu karnaa chahie
 Addressing businessmen in Bawana, Kejriwal said that he has differences with the Prime Minister on many fronts, but if he will do good things like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Yoga Day, he will be able to stand with us
 kaarobaariyon ke ek dhade dwaara 'modi-modi' ke naare ke bich unhone kaha, 'agar notebandi vastav main bhrashtachar or kalaadhan khatm kar degi, to main bhi 'modi modi' ke naare lagaaungaa
 We risked our lives with Anna in the anti-corruption movement
 ' tippaniyan Kejriwal said, 'we had welcomed the Prime Minister's move for Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Yoga Day and Surgical strike, but Pion Modi has made a mistake by bringing demonetisation and we will oppose it
 ' baad main ek soshal netwarking website par video daalkar dilli ke mukhyamantri ne apni maang doharaai ki pradhanmantri notebandi kaa faisla waapas len
 (this news has not been edited by the NDTV team
 yah syndicate feed se sidhe prakashit kii gai he
 ) unhone apni maang doharaai ki pradhanmantri is faisle ko waapas len, varanaa desh kii arthvyavastha barbaad ho jaaegi
 Kejriwal said that the Prime Minister changes his clothes several times in a day, but he gives people a discourse to sacrifice occasionally due to demonetisation
 unhone kaha, 'notebandi ke kaaran shramik, kisaan or kaarobaari barbaad ho gaye hai or log apni naukariyaan ganvaa rahe hai, lekin pradhanmantri kai baar kapade badalane main vyast hai

 According to the security forces, all three terrorists in the encounter belong to the let organization
 aatankiyon or surakshabalon ke bich ye muthbhed kupwada ke lolab jangal main guuruuvaar subah ho rahi he
 Security forces have cordoned off the entire area
 darasal ki pichley dinonkhufia agenciyonn pakistan kii ore se aatanki ghuspaith kii koshish jaankaree di thi
 While affirming the report of intelligence agencies, BK DG KK Sharma had also said that the Pakistan-based terrorist organizations are in the grip of infiltration and major attacks on the border

 aatankiyon ne somvaar ko bhi kashmir mendehshatgardifailai
 Recently intelligence inputs revealed that there are around 30 to 35 training camps and 18 to 20 launching pads active across the border
 iske alaava border par aatanki sanghathanon ke bich lagaataar meeting karne kii khabaren bhi ai thim
 Hello, Ravish Kumar
 to bijepi ko bhi pradhanmantri narendra modi ke alaava kisi chehre kii zarurat pad gai
 In states like Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, the face of the party means Modi's face
 to kya dilli ke liye yah formula badal gaya
 Another face with Modi or Kiran Bedi is bjp's face
 sawaal honge, lekin bijepi ne dilli kii raajnneeti ko dilachasp mukaam par pahunchaa diya he
 Now look at this picture in sepia tone
 ve bhi kya din the jab kiran bedi, arvind kejariwal, anna hazaare sab lokapal lokapal gaaya karte the
 But even then Kiran Bedi and Kejriwal had different opinions on many issues
 nitin gadakari ke ghar ke saamne jab arvind kejariwal ne pradarshan kiya to kiran bedi ne iskaa virodh kiya tha
 This angry scene of Kiran Bedi had become quite famous in the field
 kiran bedi kaaphi gusse main thim
 Masked and removed, he pointed to the two big leaders of the BJP that some speak here and some more there
 bijepi ke netaaon ne bhi unki is harakat kii aalochana kii thi
 You know what happened later
 arvind kejariwal ne party bana lee or anna hazaare, kiran bedi, wike singh raajnneetik dal banane ke vichaar se alag ho gaye
 VK Singh is now a minister at the Center and Kiran Bedi joined the BJP on Thursday evening
 raajnneeti main jane se batch gaye anna hazaare
 Now he has survived or forgotten like a film scene in which the head of the house keeps staring at the picture of his ancestors hanging on the wall
 filmi seen bhi real ho jaataa he
 Now indeed there is a need to return to the roots of the Anna movement and see if it was prepared under any design
 lekin sirf in ashankaon ke aadhaar par us andolan ko khaarij nahin kiya ja saktaa jisane kam se kam dilli kii raajnneeti ko is tarah se badal diya ki donon puraani partiyaan do saal kii party ke hisaab se ranneeti banane lagi hai
 Out of the sepia tone, now we come in Eastman color
 kya bijepi kiran bedi ko mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar banaaegi? party adhyaksh amit shah ne kaha ki mukhyamantri kaa ummidavaar koun hoga, party tay karegi or kahaan se chunaav ladengi yah sansadeey board tay karegaa
 BJP MP Vijay Goel tweeted that i am confident that under his inspiring leadership, BJP will win and Delhi will develop
 vaise is maamle main aupchaarik ghoshnaa nahin hui he, lekin kya kiran bedi ko arvind kejariwal ke mukaable vaale frem se baahar kar dekh paanaa sambhav hoga
 Probably not
 bijepi ke daftar main unke aagaman ko bada banane ke liye rashtriya adhyaksh amit shah or vittamantri arun jetali bhi maujuud the
 Kiran Bedi addressed it as Amit Bhai and Arun Bhai
 unhone kaha ki pradhanmantri ne unhen biji samay main bhi amit bhai or mujhe vakt diya iske liye abhaari hum
 His inspirational leadership is changing a lot of Indians and if a person like me has changed today, i think that crores would have changed
 kiran bedi ne apane police jivan se lekar saamaajik kaaryon ke bare main bhi bataaya or kaha ki jab mujhe police kamishnar nahin banaaya gaya to khud se ritairement le lee
 Because the work given to me was not challenging for me
 main ohada, gaadi, ghar or pozishan ke liye kaam nahin karti hum
 But what inspired me from today, this was progress, it was evolution, evolving was happening, then i would dedicate myself, to my larger country, it was a matter of time
 or ye samay aayaa
 He said that the change in politics started coming within him in the month of May with Narendra Modi becoming Prime Minister
 kiran bedi ne yah bhi kaha ki ye ghadi maine haath se nahin likhi
 The one above writes
 ab ye to amit shah or pradhanmantri modi hi bataa sakate hai ki kiran bedi ke liye ye ghadi unhone tay kii yaa unase bhi kisi upar vaale ne yaa dilli kii chunavi majaburiyon ne
 Kiran Bedi also told her a dream
 dilli ko duniya kii number van rajdhani banane kaa sapana
 Inspiration and dream are the two main elements in politics
 lekin unke virdohi sapana nahin siyasat dekh rahe the
 Along with the news of his involvement, his old statements on Twitter began to be removed when he tweeted on Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the Gujarat riots, when he said that BJP is not a party to vote, when he said that both Congress and BJP Hee is not transparent in terms of funds
 lekin, kisi ne yah twit nahin kiya ki unhone pradhanmantri modi kii prashansa or anushansa donon main hi kai twit kiye the
 Arvind Kejriwal has welcomed and said that i always wanted him to come into politics
 lekin aam aadmi party ke duusare netaaon ne hamalaa shuru kar diya
 Kumar Vishwas said that he never loses in wars, we are afraid of deceit, every time he is defeated by Jayachandas of his house
 ab in paktiyon main kavi ne kiran bedi ko jayachand to kah diya, lekin kya yah bhi kah diya ki paraajay ho gai he
 Another leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, Mayank Gandhi, tweeted that Kiran Bedi had also staged a sit-in, will the devotees tell whether they are Naxalites or not
 yahaan bhakt bijepi samarthakon ke bare main kaha gaya he
 Vishal Dudlani quipped that the BJP should not include Obama in the party, fearing Kejriwal
 congress netaa ajay maakan ne kaha he ki kejariwal or kiran bedi ne anna andolan ke uddeshyon ke saath dhokhaa kiya he
 BJP President Amit Shah said that the coming of Kiran Bedi will give a lot of strength to the Delhi BJP
 vittamantri arun jetali ne kaha ki kiran bedi ji kaa dilli hi nahin puure desh main naam he
 In the government too, she has been fighting as a crusader
 to kya bijepi anna andolan ke puraane saathiyon or aap ke puraane netaaon ke dam par arvind kejariwal ko gherne ja rahi he
 This is a fight that no one will let go
 kerajiwal banaam kiran kii is ladaai main tension to hoga bos
 Now we have to see who will win
 wo jo do saal se dilli kii galiyon main bhatak rahaa he yaa wo chaar hafte pehle kisi party main ain hai
 The competition is fierce this time in Delhi
 kya bijepi ko dilli main cheharaa mil gaya he
 It will be difficult for Arvind Kejriwal to surround Kiran Bedi
 prime time The budget session of Parliament is going to start from Monday, but it will not be easy for the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the Center
 uske samaksh kai chunautiyaan hongi
 Apart from protecting the opposition from attacks on various issues, it may also have to bear the displeasure of allies on issues such as violation of the rights of states and inflation
