 mukhyamantri nitish kumaar ne centre sarkaar dwaara lungar main istemaal kii jane vaali saamagree ko jiesti ke daayre se baahar karne ke liye aabhaar vyakt kiya he
 Earlier this week, the Narendra Modi government took a major decision regarding religious langars and announced that from now on, the material used in langars will be outside the purview of GST

 In the mob lynching case, the Supreme Court refused to hear the contempt petition filed against the state governments at the earliest

 isamen supreme court ne kaha tha ki hindustan main bheedtantr kii ijaajat nahin di ja sakati he
 The government is responsible for maintaining the rule of law

 The Supreme Court also said in its guidelines that Parliament enacted laws against mob lynching and governments should act in accordance with the constitution
 iske alaava court ne yah bhi kaha tha ki sarkaar mob linching ke peediton ko muaavja bhi de
 After this, the Union Home Ministry had asked all the states to strictly follow the decisions of the Supreme Court on mob lynching
 in sabake baavjood desh main mob linching kii ghatnaayen thamane kaa naam nahin le rahi hai

 The report quoted a businessman from Sirsa as saying, "when our maid did not come on Thursday, we contacted her on mobile and said that she was going to Panchkula with followers of Dera

 a well-known name in Hindi cinema and theater and a shining star of Prithviraj Kapoor's legacy, Shashi Kapoor went bye
 is sitare kii jagah ab sitaron main he
 He was rarely remembered in this place
 pichley kuch samay se biimaar the
 Shashi admitted to the hospital has become silent
 peeche ab yaadon ke kisse-fasaane duniya doharaati nazar aa rahi he
 Shashi Kapoor was the youngest son of Prithviraj Kapoor
 theatre kaa yah pitamah mana jane vaala pita or do bade bhai, mahaan sho main raaj kapur or logon ko divaana kar dene vaale shammi kapur inase bade the
 In such a situation nothing was easy for Shashi
 na filmein or na theatre
 Small caress found at home
 sabakaa pyaar mila or saath mili pipal or bargad jaise vyaktitvon ke aage khud ko khadaa kar paane kii chunauti
 Shashi Kapoor married Jennifer, aged 3, at the age of 20, know - 10 memorable things: There was a theater atmosphere in the house
 bade-bade or baari set vaale naatakon ke saath prithviraj kapur un dinon mumbai or bharat ke rangamanch par raaj karte the
 Shaukat Kaifi and Zohra Saigal were the heroines of 'papaji' i
e
 Prithviraj's theater in those days
 prithviraj khud kamaal ke adaakaar or damdaar awaz ke maalik the
 Even after that voice weakened, Akbar of Mughalazam immortalized
 isi maahaul or theatre ke tikaton ke counter se shashi kapur kii shuruaati training shuru hui
 In those days there were long queues of drama-watchers in front of Prithvi theater
 shashi pita ke saath theatre ke kaam main haath bantaate the
 In one meeting, he told that he had even worked with Papaji to distribute tickets
 ab koun kahegaa- mere paas maa he
 
 
 Read: Condolence message in memory of Shashi, but he himself started making the way forward
 yah zaruri bhi tha ki theatre kaa gharaana ban chuke parivaar kii simaaon se baahar nikalakar kuch seekhen or nayaa karen
 This could have enabled Shashi, and he also liked him
 apni kishoravastha tak wo naatakon or kuch filmon main chote-bade role nibhaate rahe or phir ek anglo-indian theatre group ke saath kalkatte chale gaye
 That theater group was operated by Jennifer's father Godfrey Kendall
 yahaan shashi ne abhinay ke nae aayam or baarikiyaan sikhin
 And here he fell in love with theater as well as Godfrey's daughter Jennifer
 ‘shakespearana’ main abhinay or ishk paravaan chadhataa gaya
 And then both theater and Jennifer became their partners for the rest of their lives
 ek indradhanushi nayakadarasal, log shashi kapur kii baat karte hue keval bollywood tak simat kar rah jate hai
 To do so would be dishonest to Shashi Kapoor's personality
 shashi kapur ne filmon main kaam kiya
 Made several successful films
 ek samay tha jab apane luk, style or adaakaari ke kaaran wo ladakiyon ke bich khaase charchit the
 But despite all this, his heart remained in the theater
 or use lekar wo parde par bhi prayog karte rahe
 Shashi Kapoor broke the Kapoor family tradition for marriage! Prithviraj Kapoor did not encourage the acting of the women of the family in the Kapoor family
 lekin shashi or jenifer ne is bhed ko tarjeeh nahin di
 Shashi Kapoor's films and dramas did not focus on routine themes
 or na hi cinema main prayogon kaa canvas kapur khandaan or tatkaaleen bhartiya cinema tak simit rahaa
 He worked for art films
 angrezi main bhartiya set kii filmon ke liye kaam kiya
 These productions continued with Ismail Merchant and James Ivory
 or is tarah shashi kapur bharat ke un pehle chehron main hai jo antarrashtriya jagat ke liye cinema bana rahe the
 To make his experiments worthwhile, he made a few films under the banner of Filmavalas
 36 chaurangi len jaisi film usee series kaa hissaa raheen
 Started by passion in 1979, this journey continued to give cinema but Shashi lost all his money in it
 1991 main amitabh ko lekar shashi ne apni sari takat ajooba main jhonk di or yah bhi flop rahi
 Shashi broke from here and then stopped production
 jab saarvajanik taur par aakhri baar dekhe gaye the shashi kapur, jhalak aae the aansu
 
 
 Jennifer had left in 1984
 kunal or karan bhi cinema main aae lekin zyaada dur chal na sake
 Shashi Kapoor used to laugh at this and said that he looks English with his face, so he could not find the place in Indian cinema that Shashi Kapoor himself had
 1993 main unki beti sanjana ne prithvi theatre kaa kaam sambhala
 But the journey ahead was more focused on giving people space for theater
 khud theatre ke liye production main simit hone ke bajaay shashi or unki beti theatre ke liye jagah or jaagrukta dene ke kaam main lag gaye
 Shashi Kapoor, who had broken up after his wife's death, was deteriorating, and then sitting quietly in a chair, watching the rising and moving to the theater, gradually became a man of solitude
 shammi kapur ke jane ke baad wo or bhi shant ho gaye
 In one conversation, he told me that it was the genetic problem of the men in the family that good good body in youth gets heavy with aging
 yah kapur khandaan ke bare main sach bhi he
 Shashi Kapoor's work was neither noisy and furious like his father's nor the speed like Raj Kapoor and Shammi Kapoor
 wo aaraam se kaam karte hue bhi bollywood or theatre ko zindaa rakh sake or sabase acchhee aayu ji sake, yah ek badi uplabdhi he
 Shashi Kapoor has calmed down
 lekin mumbai main prithvi theatre rangamanch ke liye phir se kaashi ban chukaa he
 Country and world color workers bring their work here
 shashi kapur kii beti sanjana is zimmedaari ko sambhalati hai
 Whatever Shashi Kapoor has given in this way, he will continue to be a force of cinema and theater even further
 is mahaan or abhootpurv yogadan ke liye shashi ko apane khandaan ke ek mahaan kalakaar or alag chamak vaale sitare ke taur par yaad kiya jayega

 The Constitution of India is celebrating the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Bhim Rao Ambedkar
 aazaadee ke baad ambedkar aise shaks rahe, jinaki raajnneetik viraasat par kabje ke liye partiyon main sabase zyada pratispardhaa rahi he
 He considered the only goal of his life to get the rights of equals to the Dalits and also worked for life in that context
 unhen kai baar duusari jatiyon kaa virodh bhi jhelana padaa, lekin wo kaary main hameshaa agrasar rahe
 Meanwhile he was attracted to Buddhism and abandoned Hinduism
 unke saath lakhon hinduon ne bhi buddha dharm apana liya tha
 The Mahad Satyagraha done on his behalf in the year 1927 became the voice of the rights of Dalits
 darasal us samay daliton ko oonchi jatiyon ke liye tay talab or kunon se pani nahin lene diya jaataa tha
 Babasaheb decided to challenge it and took thousands of Dalits along with him on 20 March 1927 and drank water from Mahad's public Chavadar pond
 vahiin talabon kii tarah us samay mandiron main bhi daliton ke pravesh par sakht pabandi thi
 During that time, on 2 March 1930, a historic protest was held outside the famous Kalaram temple in Nashik under the leadership of Dr

 It is said that around 10 lakh Dalits along with Ambedkar then adopted Buddhism and this was the biggest event of conversion in the whole world
 haalanki khud unhone ise dharm parivartan nahin balki dharm-janit shaareerik, maansik va aarthik daastaa se mukti bataaya
 i am born a Hindu, but Hindus will not die
 Ambedkar was trying to get the rights of Dalits with them, while his opponents were also pushing to stop them
 lambey sangharsh ke baad jab ambedkar ko bharosa ho gaya ki ve hindu dharm se jatipratha or asprishyata kii kureetiyaan dur nahin kar paa rahe hai to unhone wo aitihaasik vaktavy diya jisamen unhone kaha ki main hindu paidaa to hua hum, lekin hindu maruunga nahin

 yahaan saround bhi behatar he or laudnes bhi driver sies ke hisaab se kaaphi acchhee he
 We have only a little complaint about the channel separation
 ailexa yuj karne ke liye aapako Lumiford u Smart ap ko yuj karnaa hoga or ye behad behatar tareeke se kaam karata he
 It is also worth noting that Micron or calling support features of wireless speakers are usually named only, but it is also better for speaker calling
 ab duusari taraf baat karte hai sabavufar dock kii to aapako bataa den yahaan downfiring drivers kaa istemaal kiya gaya he or sterio ko atech karne ke baad hi ise yuj kiya jaataa he
 Its audio output also impressed us a lot
 hamane isamen electro-trans, EDM, or BDM or clasical treks ko khaastaur par test khaas kiya or driver sies ke hisaab se base output behtareen he
 Only you can put a little negative side to sub-base
 yani overol audio quality kaaphi impressive he
 i would like to praise the company for delivering the best audio quality in compact size
 baaki bydaree ko lekar bhi aapako koi shikaayat nahin aegi
 Negative Factor: While the company impresses us in a compact size with clean and crisp audio quality, there is a problem when it is not true wireless
 kyonki sabavufar dock ke saath sterio spikar kamaal kii audio quality detaa he lekin dock ko bina electricity plag ke istemaal nahin kiya ja saktaa he
 In such a situation, the price of this speaker is kept, it does not agree with it
 kyonki yadi kisi yujar ko adishnal base ke liye iske dock ko plag-in agar karnaa hi he to wo bazaar main uplabdh kisi bhi 2
 1 or 5
 1 spikar main hi paise lagaana chahega
 2 of good quality
 1 spikars bazaar main 3 hajaar rupee se bhi kam main mil jate hai or rahi baat sterio spikar kii to ise alag se istemaal karte vakt base ke liye samjhauta karnaa padataa he, aise main Boat Stone 700A jaise spikars main paise lagaana zyada behatar hoga
 It also has Alexa support and good audio quality
 meri samaj se yadi Lumiford ko apane is spikar ko sahi myne main bechnaa he to isaki keemat 5 hajaar rupee ke aasapaas kar deni chahie
 The rest of the compact and look are its positive factors
 faisla:lumiford 2
 1 Subwoofer Dock is a speaker with excellent quality, unique design and premium look in compact size
 hamaari samaj se keval isaki keemat bhartiya bazaar ke hisaab se zyada he
 Rating - 8 / 10 bhartiya mausam vibhaag ke mutabik bengal kii khadi main kam dabaav kaa kshetra ban rahaa he jiske chalate mausam vaigyanikon kaa anumaan he ki isse monsoon tateey ilaakon ko paar kar legaa or kolkata samet pashchim bengal or aas-paas ke ilaakon main barish kaa intjaar khatm ho jayega
 According to IMD data released, due to this low pressure area in the Gulf, the monsoon move will gain momentum and the southwest monsoon will take over most of West Bengal in the next 3-4 three days
 vahiin nijeemausam agency skymetaka bhi maananaa he ki agle 48 ghanton main monsoon samudri ilaakon main majboot hokar sataha par aa saktaa he jiske chalate 4-5 dinon main pashchim bengal, odisha or bihar ke ilaakon main acchhee barish hone ke asaar he
 Significantly, the late south-west monsoon arriving late on the coasts of Kerala has been stable for the last three days
 haalanki monsoon ke pashchimi chor ne thodi badhat banaate hue maharashtra, konkan or goa par pakad banaai he
 The eastern end has also remained stable for the last few days
 haalanki pichley kuch dinon main pashchim bengal ke kuch or odisha ke kai ilaakon main chhutput barish dekhne ko mili he or ab bengal kii khadi main punap rahe dabaav se in ilaakon main agle kuch dinon main tej barish hone kii sambhaavna he
 The Meteorological Department claims that the monsoon is expected to receive light to moderate rain in some areas of Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar in the next few days
 madhya pradesh ke mukhyamantri shivaraj singh chouhan ko pratikon main baat kehane kii kala bakhubi aati he
 When the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Shivraj Singh Chauhan embarked on a Jan Ashirwad Yatra in the state on 22 July to bring power to the BJP for the third time, posters in Ujjain town of Mahakal were absent from the post of Chairman of the Central Election Campaign Committee
 lekin 30 din baad jab yatra sangh ke garh maane jane vaale neemuch se gujri to modi samarthakon ne shahar main unke poster chaspaan kar die, jisamen chouhan ko madhya pradesh kii takadir, to modi ko desh kii tasviir bataaya gaya
 In the poster-banner of Jan Aashirwad Yatra, suddenly Modi's arrival is considered as an answer to congratulate Chauhan by wearing a Muslim hat in Bhopal on the occasion of Eid
 us manch se film abhinayta raja muraad ne modi par nishaanaa sadhate hue kaha tha ki anya mukhyamantriyon ko chouhan se sikh leni chahie kyonki topi pahanane se kisi kaa dharm nahin badal jaataa
 Murad's anti-modi comment came as a shock to the BJP, "by joining someone's festival, their religion is not corrupted
 chouhan kisi bhi anya mukhyamantriyon se kam lokapriy nahin hai, lekin ve har saal id ke maukey par hamen badhai dete hai, topi pahante hai
 However, his opposition and national vice-president Uma Bharti were upset with Chauhan not objecting to it
 unhone is maamle ko party forum par uthaane kaa elaan bhi kar diya tha
 But two days later, Chauhan compared Modi to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
 unhone kaha ki modi kaa kaam or kad donon sardaar patel jaisaa he
 However, Chauhan here also took the support of such a symbol, who despite being the first in the race for the post of Prime Minister, remained as the Home Minister of the country
 haalanki bijepi main isse pehle sardaar patel kii tarah laalkrishna adwani ko louh purush kaha jaataa rahaa he, jinhen bijepi ko satta ke shikhar tak pahunchane kaa shrey jaataa he
 But when the turn of the Prime Minister's chair came, he had to go ahead and propose the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee
 shiv ke 'raaj’ main modi factornarendra modi ko lekar bijepi cader main jabardast utsaah he, lekin kya modi kaa jaadu madhya pradesh main chalegaa? khud chouhan gaahe-bagaahe vikaas ke modi model ko kuch is tarah khaarij karte rahe hai, ''vah model gujarat ke liye behtareen he, lekin har rajya kii apni paristhitiyaan hoti hai
 "recently, the Chauhan government issued an order to teach portions of the Bhagavad Gita in madrasas, so they did not delay in withdrawing after opposition from Muslim organizations
 party ke ek netaa kehete hai, ''aadhikarik postaron main modi kahin nahin he, lekin sthaneey str par kaaryakarta apni pasand se kuch netaaon ke poster zarur laga rahe hai
 By the way Chauhan is enough in the state
 ”rajya main kareeb 7 fisadi muslim aabaadi he, jo modi ke naam par puri tarah se ekajute hokar bijepi ke khilaaf ja sakati he
 The way Chauhan started the scheme to send the poor elders of the state to the religious places under the Chief Minister's Teerthadarshan Yojana, he took care of all religions
 bijepi main chouhan ke sabase bade sangrakshak maane jane vaale laalkrishna adwani ne is tirthadarshan yojana ke bare main india today se apana vichaar kuch is tarah saajha kiya, ''is yojana main yatriyon ke chayan ke liye shivaraj ne aavedak ke varisht naagarik hone, lekin iskar daata nahin hone ko aadhaar banaaya
 The first train that i left was Rameswaram and the second train went to Ajmersharif
 shivaraj ne is yojana ke liye jo 17 tirthasthan chune hai, unamem sabhi panthon ke tirth sthaan hai
 "it is clear that the state BJP is assuming that if Modi is paid attention in the assembly elections, the benefit will be less loss
 vaise bhi 10 saal se satta main hone kii vajah se swaabhaavik satta virdohi lahar hoti he
 Due to which the possibility of reducing seats is being expressed, but the popularity of Chief Minister Chauhan is at the peak in the state
 rajya kii janata unhen ab kendriya raajnneeti main modi ke mukaable ek prabal daavedaar ke taur par bhi dekh rahi he, jaisaa 2012 ke vidhansabha chunaav main modi ke liye gujarat kii janata soch rahi thi
 If Modi is preferred in the assembly elections, then Chauhan's aura will be weak in front of Modi, which can prove to be harmful for the party
 isliye rajya ikai ko modi ke naam par vidhansabha chunaav main phayda nahin dikh rahaa
 Why avoid 'namo'? The state unit of BJP is keeping Modi away from this visit because Chauhan is the party's mascot for the November assembly elections
 jan aashirwad yatra ko mil rahe samarthan or chouhan kii lokapriyata ke badhate graph ne bijepi kaa manobal badha diya he
 BJP leaders say that Chauhan himself is not in favor of giving Modi preference in the yatra
 isaki sabase badi vajah chouhan bijepi kaa aisa cheharaa ban chuke hai jisase musalamaanon ko dar nahin lagata
 Advani himself has been described as a leader of equal thought for all varnas, castes and sects
 jabaki modi ko lekar musalamaanon kii dharna bilkul ulat maani jaati he
 According to political experts, the most trusted aides of state BJP president Narendra Tomar and Chauhan do not want to allow polarization of minority voters by giving Modi a place in the poster
 apni dharmanirpeksh chhavi kii vajah se muslim samaaj main bhi chouhan ke chaahane vaale hai
 He never refrained from wearing a Muslim cap, while Modi refused to wear the cap on behalf of Saeed Imam Shahi Syed in a fasting program under the Sadbhavna Mission in 2011 and was merely wearing a chadar
 baad main imam ne kaha tha, ''modi kaa inkaar sirf meraa apmaan nahin, balki islam kaa apmaan he
 "but a Muslim teacher says," We are extremely grateful to Chief Minister Chauhan for the way he resolved the Bhojshala dispute with impartiality
 ” darasal basant panchami ke maukey par bhojashala main do samudaayon ke bich puja-paath ko lekar tanaavpurn sthiti paidaa ho gai thi
 But the state administration handled that dispute vigorously and attempts to worsen the situation were thwarted
 ise lekar hindutvvaadiyon ke ek kheme ne shivaraj ko lekar naaraazgi bhi jataai thim
 Proponents of Modi also started showing the popularity of Joshbhale Chauhan is at the top in the state, but Modi supporters are also no less
 sangh ke garh maane jane vaale neemuch jile main gaiyr-aadhikarik taur par hi sahi, modi ke poster laga samarthakon ne chouhan ko subai to modi ko rashtriya netaa bataane kii koshish kii he
 Neemuch is also important because it is the Karmabhoomi of Kushabhau Thackeray and he was the first RSS pracharak to come here in 1942
 jansangh ke nirmaan ke baad 1952 main loksabhaa ke liye chune gaye hindu kattarpanthi umashankar trivedi, shyama prasad mukherjee or bandopadhyaay bhi lambey samay tak neemuch main rahe hai
 Trivedi was elected to the Lok Sabha from the neemuch-mandsaur seat in 1962 on a Jan Sangh ticket
 jab party kii ichha ke khilaaf jaakar chouhan ne 2,000 main pradesh adhyaksh kaa chunaav ladaa tha, tab thakare hi rashtriya adhyaksh the
 Chauhan's Jan Ashirwad Yatra has so far traveled in 66 assemblies, covering a distance of 2,000 km, while the entire journey of the journey is more than 8,000 km
 vishram ke baad yatra kaa aglaa charan ab 27 agast ko shivpuri jile se shuru hoga
 It is believed that Modi's posters can be seen again in those areas considered to be the strongholds of the Sangh
 shivaraj samarthak is baat ko lekar raahat kii saans le sakate he ki pradesh kii raajnneeti main modi samarthak koi dhada nahin he or chouhan ke khilaaf rajya main koi majboot virdohi lobby nahin he
 The national leadership itself was confused between Modi and Shivraj two months ago when bjp's patriarch LK Advani in Gwalior called Chauhan's Madhya Pradesh better than Modi's Gujarat
 donon ke bich matbhed 23 june ko us vakt sataha par aa gaye jab modi ne uttarakhand kii traasadee main tabah kedarnath mandir kaa punarnirmaan karaane kii ichha jaahir kii
 But Chauhan said at the same time, "our first priority should be to save those trapped in the disaster
" mandir kaa punarnirmaan baad main bhi ho saktaa he
 “the national leadership itself is in a dilemma whether to announce Modi as the PM candidate before the assembly elections or later
 bijepi ke anya mukhyamantri bhi dil se vidhansabha chunaav ke baad faisla liye jane ke paksh main hai, taaki rajya main jitaane kaa shrey modi kii bajaae unke khate main hi rahe
 Regarding keeping Modi away from Chauhan's election journey, a state unit leader says that since it is an assembly election, there is no justification for focusing on Modi
 ve aage jodate hai, ''agar modi ko party kii ore se aupchaarik pradhanmantri ummidavaar ghoshit kar diya jaataa he to ham unke poster vishesh rup se taiyaar rath par bhi lagaayenge
 The yatra will run till 27 October
 lekin philhal sabaki nigaah 25 sitambar ko hone vaale kaaryakarta mahakumbh par he, jisamen 5-7 lakh booth kaaryakarta pahuchenge
 Whether or not there will be Modi with the entire central leadership, this will clarify the direction of BJP politics

 According to China's official newspaper Global Times, the steady increase in foreign investment in India shows its progress
 china ko chupchaap bharat kii pragati dekhni chahie or usase mukaable ke liye taiyaar rahanaa chahie
 China should consider its new development policy
 lekh main kaha gaya he ki videshi nivesh ke jariye bharat apni pareshaaniyon ko dur kar rahaa he or isamen safal bhi ho rahaa he
 The newspaper wrote that China had also adopted such a policy earlier, now India is also succeeding in it
 agar pehle bharat infrastracchar, skill se achoota rahaa he to vah apni in kamiyon ko videshi nivesh ke jariye khatm kar rahaa he
 The Government of India is also making it a success through Make in India
 chini media ne un sabhi companiyon kii list kaa bhi zikr kiya he jo bharat main nivesh kar rahi hai jisamen china kii kuch vinirmaan kshetra kii companiya bhi shaamil hai
 According to the article, attention should be paid to what has been happening in India and China for the last two decades

 The newspaper writes that Beijing will not compromise in any way regarding its territorial sovereignty

 bharat, china or bhutan seemaa par sthit doklam par china apana daawa kar rahaa he, vahiin bharat or bhutan kaa kahana he ki ye hissaa bhutan kaa he or vivaadit he
 The Chinese Foreign Ministry, which is also interfering in Kashmir, made the Kashmir issue its pawn and said that the situation there has caught the attention of the international community

 is daanv se sarkaar takreeban 45 karod logon ke jivan ko sidhe prabhavit karegi, haalanki isse sarkari khajaane par takreeban sava lakh karod rupee prativarsh kaa boj bhi padegaa
 The Union Labor Ministry is working on this scheme and its target is crores of unorganized laborers working across the country
 sutron ke mutabik shram mantralay ne 1
 a draft of Rs 2 lakh crore Universal Social Security Scheme has been prepared
 is skim ke tahat centre sarkaar garib jansankhya ko masik pension samet kai aarthik laabh dekar saamaajik suraksha dene kii taiyaari main he
 Under this scheme, the central government will provide monthly pension, insurance and maternity cover to provide social security to the 20% population (45 crore workforce) falling in the lowest category
 skim ke duusare charan main desh main sabhi ke liye svaichhik medical insurance or berogari bhatta diya jayega
 The Labor Ministry will now send a draft of its scheme to the Ministry of Finance so that its approval can be made and funds can be arranged for the scheme
 sarkaar kii yojana agle saal tak is skim ko jameen par utaarne kii he jisase 2019 ke aam chunaavon tak aam aadmi ko skim kaa phayda pahunchaaya ja sake
 According to the 5 economic challenges, these are the biggest obstacles in Modi's mission 2019, about 1 from the central treasury to the central government to implement this scheme
 2 lakh karod rupee prati varsh kharch karne honge
 According to the central government's assessment, about 20 percent of the country's population will benefit from this scheme
 is skim kaa phayda pahunchane ke liye kendra sarkaar saamaajik, aarthik or jati janaganana kii shrenee kaa istemaal karegi
 It is worth noting that there is a total of 45 crore workforce in the country, out of which only 10% of the workforce is in the organized sector and it gets some kind of social security
 vahiin prati varsh lagbhag 1 karod nae log is workforce main shaamil hote hai
 Social security is far from the majority of these people, even the minimum salary is not available
 aise adhikansh log asangathit kshetra main kaam karte hai
 The biggest challenge before the Modi government in implementing this scheme is the pressure on the state exchequer, but it is believed that this scheme will give a big boost to its popularity just before the elections
 sarkaar or bijepi se jude sutara maanate hai ki ye yojana party ke liye vaise hi chamatkaari sabit ho sakati he jaise upie-1 ke liye manaregaa hui thi or manmohan sarkaar ne 2009 main jabardast vaapasi kii thi

 Possible Playing XI: India (probable): 1 Rohit Sharma, 2 Shikhar Dhawan, 3 Virat Kohli (captain), 4 KL Rahul, 5 Rishabh Pant (wicketkeeper), 6 Dinesh Karthik, 7 Krunal Pandya, 8 Bhuvneshwar Kumar, 9 Kuldeep Yadav / Yuzvendra
 Chahal, 10 Jaspreet Bumrah, 11 Khalil Ahmed
 australia (sambhavit): 1 aron finch (captain), 2 darsi short, 3 kris lin, 4 glen maxwell, 5 marcus stoinis, 6 ben mcderrmott, 7 elex kerri (wicketiper), 8 nathan coolter nile, 9 andrew taai , 10 jesan behrendorf, 11 billy stenlek Jasprit Bumrah, regarded as Team India's limited overs specialist bowler, showed in the Johannesburg Test against South Africa that he was as much of a hit in the longest format of the game
 bumraah ne apane test kariyar kaa pehla five wicket haul lekar south africa ko pehali pari main 194 ranon par sametane main ahm bhoomika nibhaai thi
 Bumrah wreaked havoc on the Bumrah host team in Pasajohanisburg and returned the pavilion to five African batsmen and returned India to the match
 hashim amala (61), africa ke captain phalf du plasis (8), quinton di cock (8), endile fehalukvayo (9) or lungi nagidi (0) bumraah ke shikaar bane the
 In the African ODI squad against India, Lungi Nagidi was presented as a chance for the future and Jasprit Bumrah, who bowled in the Twenty20, was selected by the selectors as an extra fast bowler, given the bouncy pitch of South Africa
 After this, Bumrah has also vindicated his selection and has submitted his claim for the upcoming foreign tours of India
 aapako bataa den ki apane special ection or yorker ke kaaran limited overs cricket main kaaphi safal rahe bumraah ne ab tak 31 vanade maichon main 56 or 32 tii-20 antarrashtriya main 40 wicket liye hai
 Interestingly, Bumrah was given a place in the Test team based on this limited overs success, as he did not play any First Class matches during the last one year
 gauratlab he ki team india apni pehali pari main 187 ranon par ol out ho gai
 After which the Indian bowlers piled South Africa's team for 194 runs
 pehali pari ke aadhaar par africa ko 7 ran kii badhat hasil hui
 In the second innings, Team India has so far scored 49 runs losing 1 wicket and has taken a total of 42 runs lead over Africa
