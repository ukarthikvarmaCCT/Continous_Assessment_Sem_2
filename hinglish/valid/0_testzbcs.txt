 In 1903, at the age of 16, he was married to Sivakamu, the sister of a distant relationship
 us samay unki patni kii aayu maatr 10 varsh kii thi
 So, after three years, his wife started living with him
 yadhyapi unki patni sivaakamu ne paramparaagat rup se shiksha praapt nahin kii thi, lekin unka telegu bhashaa par acha adhikaar tha
 She could also write and read English
 1908 main radhakrishnan dampati ko santaan ke rup main putree kii prapti hui
 In 1908, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts in the first class and got special qualification in philosophy
 shaadi ke 6 varsh baad hi 1909 main unhone kala main snatakottar pariksha bhi uteern kar lee
 The subject of his philosophy was philosophy
 ucch adhyayan ke dauraan vah apni nijee aamadani ke liye bacchon ko tution padhaane kaa kaam bhi karte rahe
 In 1908 he also wrote a research article to obtain the title of MA
 is samay unki aayu maatr bees varsh kii thi
 This increased his knowledge of the scriptures
 sheeghra hi unhone vedon or upanishdon kaa bhi gahan adhyayan kar liya
 Apart from this, he also studied Hindi and Sanskrit language very interestingly
 shiksha kaa prabhaav jahaan prayek vyakti par nishchit rup se padataa he, vahiin shaikshik santhaan kii gunvattta bhi apana prabhaav chhodti he
 At that time Western values of life were deeply instilled within the students by Christian institutions
 yahi kaaran he ki chrishchiyan sansthaaon main adhyayan karte hue radhakrishnan ke jivan main ucch gun samahit ho gayi
 But there was also another change in them which was due to Christian institutions
 kuch log hindutvvaadi vichaaron ko hey drushti se dekhte the or unki aalochana karte the
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan took his criticism as a challenge and started to study Hindu scriptures deeply
 dow radhakrishnan yah jaananaa chaahate the ki vastutah kis samskruti ke vichaaron main chetanta he or kis samskruti ke vichaaron main jadta he? tab swaabhaavik antarpragna dwaara is baat par dridhtaa se vishwaas karnaa armbh kar diya ki bharat ke duurastha sthanon par rahane vaale garib tathaa anpadh vyakti bhi pracheen satya ko jaanate the
 For this reason Radhakrishnan came to know comparatively that Indian spirituality is very rich and criticisms of Hinduism by Christian missionaries are baseless
 isse inhone yah nishkarsh nikaala ki bhartiya samskruti dharm, gyaan or satya par aadhaarit he jo praani ko jivan kaa sachcha sandesh detii he
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan had well known that life is very short but the happiness prevailing in it is uncertain
 is kaaran vyakti ko sukh-dukh main sambhaav se rahanaa chaiye
 In fact, death is an unshakable truth, which makes the rich poor all their grass and does not make any kind of class distinction
 sachcha gyaan vahi he jo aapke andar ke agyaan ko samaapt kar saktaa he
 a life of simplistic contentment is better than the egoistic life of the rich, in whom dissatisfaction resides
 ek shant mastishk behatar he, taaliyon kii un gadgadahaton se; jo sansadon evam darbaron main sunaayi detii hai
 In fact, this is why Dr
 Radhakrishnan was able to understand the moral values of Indian culture, because he wanted to test the truth of the criticisms made by the missionaries themselves
 isiilie kaha gaya he ki aalochanaayen parishuddhi kaa kaary karti hai
 All mothers want to see higher values in their children
 isi kaaran ve bacchon ko ishwar par vishwaas rakhane, paap se dur rahane evam musiibat main phase logon kii madad karne kaa paath padhaati hai
 Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan also learned that respect for all religions has been taught in Indian culture and the sense of equality for all religions is also a unique identity of Hindu culture
 is prakaar unhone bhartiya samskruti kii vishisht pahchaan ko samajha or uske kaafii nazadik ho gayi
 Dr
 Radhakrishnan considered the whole world as a school
 unka maananaa tha ki shiksha ke dwaara hi maanav mastishk kaa sadupyog kiya ja saktaa he
 Therefore, the world should manage education as a single entity
 britain ke edinbura vishvavidhyalay main diye apane bhaashan main dow sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne kaha tha- "maanav ko ek hona chahie
 The complete goal of human history is the liberation of mankind only when the basis of the policies of the countries is to try to establish peace all over the world
 " dow radhakrishnan apni buddhi se paripurna vyakhyaaon, anandadaayi abhivyaktiyon or halki gudgudane vaali kahaniyon se chaatro ko mantramugdh kar dete the
 He also used to motivate his students to adopt high moral values in their conduct
 vah jis bhi vishay ko padhaate the, pehle swayan uskaa gahan adhyayan karte the
 He used to make even a serious subject like philosophy, simple, interesting and dear to his style
 1909 main 21 varsh kii umr main dow radhakrishnan ne madras presidency college main kanishtha vyaakhyaata ke taur par darshan shaastra padhaanaa prarambh kiya
 It was his best fortune that he got a livelihood suited to his nature
 yahan unhone 7 varsh tak na keval adhyaapan kaary kiya apitu swayan bhi bhartiya darshan or bhartiya dharm kaa gaharaai se adhyayan kiya
 In those days, it was necessary for the lecturer that he should also get training for teaching
 isi kaaran 1910 main radhakrishnan ne shikshan kaa prashikshan madras main lenaa armbh kar diya
 At this time, his salary was only 37 rupees
 darshan shaastra vibhaag ke tatkaaleen profesar radhakrishnan ke darshan shastreey gyaan se kaafii abhibhoot hue
 They allowed him to be absent from philosophy classes
 lekin iske badale main yah shart rakhi ki vah unke sthaan par darshanashastra kii kakshaon main padhaa den
 Then Radhakrishna gave thirteen such impressive lectures to his classmates, which surprised even those learners
 iskaa kaaran yah tha ki unki vishay par gahari pakad thi, darshan shaastra ke sambandh main drushtikon spasht tha or vyaakhyaan dete samay unhone upyukt shabdon kaa chayan bhi kiya tha
 a short booklet titled "essential Elements of Psychology" by Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was also published in 1912 which was a collection of his lectures given in class
 is pustika ke dwaara unki yah yogyata pramanit hui ki "prayek pad kii vyakhya karne ke liye unke paas shabdon kaa atul bhandar to he hi, unki samaran shakti bhi atyant vilakshan he
 " jab dow radhakrishnan europe evam america pravaas se punah bharat laute to yahan ke vibhinn vishvavidhyalayon ne unhen maanad oopaadhiyaan pradaan kar unki vidvatta kaa sammaan kiya
 In the winter of 1928, he first met Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru when he came to Calcutta to attend the annual session of the Congress Party
 yadhyapi sarvapalli radhakrishnan bhartiya shaikshik seva ke sadsy hone ke kaaran kisi bhi raajnneetik sambhaashan main hissedari nahin kar sakate the, tathaapi unhone is varjana kii koi parvaah nahin kii or bhaashan diya
 In 1929, he was invited by the 'university of Manchester' to give lectures
 inhone maanchester evam landan main kai vyaakhyaan diye
 The following institutional service functions are seen in the scope of their educational achievements- sarvapalli radhakrishnan ne aisa hi kiya or thik raatri 12 baje apane sambodhan ko viraam diya
 None other than Pandit Nehru and Radhakrishnan were aware of this
 azaadi ke baad unase aagrah kiya gaya ki vah mathrubhumi kii seva ke liye vishisht rajdoot ke rup main soviet sangh ke saath rajanyik kaaryon kii purti karen
 Thus, he was chosen as the new successor of Vijayalakshmi Pandit
 pandit nehru ke is chayan par kai vyaktiyon ne aashcharya vyakt kiya ki ek darshanashastri ko rajanyik sevaaon ke liye kyon chunaa gaya? unhen yah sandeh tha ki doctor radhakrishnan kii yogyataayen saunpi gai zimmedaari ke anukool nahin hai
 But Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan later proved that he was the best Indian diplomat appointed in Moscow
 ve ek gaiyr paramparawaadi rajanyik the
 Mantras which were late at night, they used to participate in them till 10 o'clock in the night, because after that their sleeping time was over
 jab radhakrishnan ek shikshak the, tab bhi ve niyamon ke daayaron main nahin bandhe the
 He used to come 20 minutes late to class and leave ten minutes earlier
 inkaa kahana tha ki kaksha main inhen jo vyaakhyaan dena hota tha, vah 20 minute ke paryaapt samay main sampann ho jaataa tha
 Even after this, he remained the beloved and respected teacher of the students
 1952 main soviet sangh se aane ke baad doctor radhakrishnan uparashtrapati nirvaachit kiye gayi
 a new post of Vice President was created under the Constitution
 nehru ji ne is pad hetu radhakrishnan kaa chayan karke punah logon ko chaunkaa diya
 He wondered why no Congress party politician was elected for the post
 uparashtrapati ke rup main radhakrishnan ne rajyasabha main adhyaksh kaa padbhaar bhi sambhaala
 In 1952, he became the Vice President of India
 baad main pandit nehru kaa yah chayan bhi sarthak siddh hua, kyonki uparashtrapati ke rup main ek gaiyr raajnneetijna vyakti ne sabhi raajnneetigyon ko prabhavit kiya
 All the members of Parliament appreciated him for his work
 inaki sadashyata, dridhtaa or vinodi swabhaav ko log aaj bhi yaad karte hai
 The birthday of Dr
 Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, the second but unique President of our country, is celebrated every year as 'teacher's Day'
 is din samast desh main bharat sarkaar dwaara shreshth shikshakon ko puraskaar bhi pradaan kiya jaataa he
 Although he was conferred with the title of "sir" by the British Empire in 1931, his justification for Dr
 Radhakrishnan was over after attaining independence
 jab ve uparashtrapati ban gayi to swatantra bharat ke pratham raashtrapati dow rajendra prasad ji ne 1954 main unhen unki mahaan darshanik va shaikshik uplabdhiyon ke liye desh kaa sarvocch alankaran bharat ratna pradaan kiya

 This process starts with a throat infection caused by streptococcal bacteria
 yadi iskaa ilaaj nahin kiya jaye, gale kaa yah sankraman rumetic bukhaar main badal jaataa he
 Rheumatic heart disease develops due to recurrent rheumatic fever
 rumetic bukhaar ek soojanevaali beemaari he, jo sharir ke, khaas kar hriday, jodon, mastishk yaa twachaa ko jodanevaale utakon ko prabhavit karti he
 When rheumatic fever permanently damages the heart, that condition is called rheumatic heart disease
 har umr ke log gambhir rumetic bukhaar se peedit ho sakate hai, lekin saamanyataur par yah paanch se 15 varsh tak kii umr ke bacchon main hota he
 a damaged heart valve either does not close completely or does not open completely
 pehali sthiti ko chikitsakeey bhashaa main insphisiency or duusari sthiti ko stenosis kehete hai
 The blood in the heart valve, which is not completely closed, goes back to the same chamber of the heart from which it is pumped
 ise rigargitation yaa licage kehete hai
 With the next heartbeat, this blood crosses the valve and mixes with the normally flowing blood
 hriday se guzaranevaali khun kii yah atirikt maatra hriday kii mansapeshiyon par atirikt boj daalati he
 When the heart valve does not open completely, then the heart has to pump more than normal amount of blood, so that enough blood goes into the body in a narrow way
 saamanyataur par iskaa koi lakshan tab tak dikhaai nahin detaa, jab tak ki rasta atyant sankara na ho jaye
 Chest X-rays and Isoji are two common tests that indicate whether the heart has been affected or not
 chikitsak iskaa upachaar marij ke saamaanya swasthya, chikitsakeey itihaas or beemaari kii gambhirtha ke aadhaar par tay karte hai
 Since rheumatic fever is the cause of heart disease, its best treatment is to prevent recurrent rheumatic fever

 The Nordic languages belong to the German language community and accordingly the German umlauts are also found in these languages
 pratham shatabdi main nordic bhashaaon ne pruthak hokar apana nayaa samudaay banaaya
 Inscriptions written in the alphabet of the old 24 letters, borrowed in the languages of Finland and Lapland and preserved for many centuries without alteration, instructions given by ancient famous writers such as Caesar and Tacitus, etc
 are all considered At the time, the same language was spoken throughout the Nordic region, namely the Denmark and the peninsula of Scandinavia

 The Danish language first became Rune Danish, then Ancient Danish and later New Danish
 madhyayug or uske baad ke samay main danish bhashaa main kuch vishistataaen utpann ho gayi jisase danish bhashaa sanatani swedish bhashaa se alag ho gai
 The Danish language is made up of these provincial languages, which include the language of Yildand, the language of the principal island and the eastern Danish
 1550 i

 Today, in relation to the German language, it would be reasonable to assume the boundary of Fleinsburg, the border of the sea of rocks, to the exit of the north ocean of Vidos
 ab danish bhashaa 47 lakh logon main boli jaati he
 The Swedish language Rune Swedish until 1225 AD, until 1526 AD - when the New Testament of the Bible was published - exists in ancient Swedish and then in New Swedish
 pracheen samay se swedish bhashaa aaj ke sweden ke baahar bhi boli jaati he, jaise oland or finland ke kinare par
 Today around 70 million people speak Swedish

 To date, at least 1 million people speak English as well as Nordic languages, due to the huge transboundary movement from Scandinavia to North America until the First World War after 1850

 Yama or Pluto is the second largest dwarf planet in the Solar System
 pluto ko kabhi saura mandal kaa sabase bahari grah mana jaataa tha, lekin ab ise saura mandal ke bahari kyper ghere kii sab se badi khagoleey vastu mana jaataa he
 Pluto, like other objects in the Kuiper circle, has a smaller size and mass - only one-third the size of the Earth's moon
 suraj ke ird-gird isaki parikrama kii kaksha bhi thodi besangi he - yah kabhi to varun kii kaksha ke andar jaakar suraj se 30 khagoleey ikai dur hota he or kabhi dur jaakar surya se 45 khai par pahunch jaataa he
 Pluto is mostly made of frozen nitrogen, water ice and stone, like other objects in the Kiper circle
 pluto ko suraj kii ek puri parikrama karte hue 248

 Pluto has a diameter of about 2,300 km, i
e
 18% of the Earth
 uskaa rang kaala, naarangi or safed kaa mishran he
 It is said that the difference between the colors of Pluto is seen in very few objects of the solar system, that is, the colors are mostly the same
 san 1994 se lekar 2003 tak kiye gaye adhyayan main dekha gaya ke pluto ke rangon main badlaav aayaa he
 The color of the North Pole was slightly brighter and the South Pole slightly thickened
 mana jaataa he ke yah pluto par badalte mausamon kaa sanket he
 Pluto has a very thin atmosphere consisting of nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide
 jab pluto parikrama karte hue suraj se dur ho jaataa he to us par thand bad jaati he or inhi gaison kaa kuch bhaag jamkar barf kii tarah uski sataha par gir jaataa he, jis se uskaa vayumandal or bhi patala ho jaataa he
 When Pluto approaches the sun, some part of this ice lying on its surface becomes gas and enters the atmosphere
 pluto ke paanch gyaat upgrah hai - 1978 main khoj kiya gaya shairan jo ki sabase bada he or jiskaa vyas yama kaa aadha he, 2005 main khoj kiye gaye do nanhe chandramaa, nix or hydra, sticks or 20 july 2011 ko ghoshit kiya gaya karberos jo ki aakaar main 30 ki

 In 1930, American astronomer Clyde Tombou discovered Pluto and was considered the ninth planet in the Solar System
 dhire-dhire pluto ke bare main kuch aisi chijen pataa chalin jo anya grahon se alag thim - These things made the astronomers doubt whether there was any runaway satellite of Pluto Varun, although it was also less likely because Pluto and Varun would never come close orbiting
 phir, san 1990 ke baad, vaigyanikon ko bahut si varun-paar vastuen milane lageen jinaki kakshaayen, rup-rang or banaavat pluto se milti julati thim
 Today scientists have recognized that there is a whole circle in this area of the solar system, in which similar items are found, of which Pluto is only one
 isi ghere kaa naam kyper gheraa rakhaa gaya
 In 2004–2005, Humeya and Makemake met at the same Kiper circle, which was much larger
 2005 main kyper ghere se bhi baahar siris mila, jo pluto se bada tha
 It was different from all other planets and resembled Pluto

 In this way, the classification of animals and plants is used in classics or taxonomy in English, two terms for taxonomy - taxonomy and systematics
 karl liniyas ne 1735 i
 main sistemaa naturai naamak pustak systematics shabd ke aadhaar par likhi thi
 In the modern era both these terms are used for plant and animal classification
 vargiki kaa kaary aakaariki, akritivigyaan kriyavigyaan, paristhitiki or anuvanshiki par aadhaarit he
 Like other scientific disciplines, it is also an analysis of many types of knowledge, beliefs and systems, which are used in the field of classification

 The basic formulation of taxonomy is based on morphology, morphology, ecology and genetics
 anya vaigyanik anushasano kii tarah yah bhi anek prakaar ke gyaan, mat or pranaaliyon kaa sanshleshan he, jiskaa prayog vargeekaran ke kshetra main hota he
 The first step of any kind of biological analysis is the classification of it in a systematic way; Therefore, the first step in studying a plant, or animal, is its naming, classification and then description
 aajkal padap kii chaar lakh jatiyon se adhik jatiyaan gyaat hai
 These are sixty times greater than the time of Linnaeus
 prati varsh lagbhag 4,750 nai jatiyon kaa varnan hota he
 More than a million names have been given from 1763 to 1942 AD in plant groups called phenerogams and cryptougams, including synonyms and subcastes
 varnit jantuon kii jatiyaan ginati main padap jatiyon se kahin adhik hai
 The names of more than two million castes, including the sub-castes, are known and about 10,000 new castes are described every year
 vargeekaran vigyaan kaa itihaas utana hi purana he jitna maanav kaa itihaas
 As soon as it was understood, man started recognizing and naming the animals and plants around him
 greece ke anek pracheen vidwaan, visheshat: hipocreties ne or democritus, ne apane adhyayan main jantuon ko sthaan diya he
 Apparently Aristotle has compiled the wisdom of his time appropriately
 aristotle ke ullekh main vargeekaran kaa prarambh dikhaai padataa he
 They are of the opinion that animals can be separated on the basis of their way of living, nature and physical size
 inhone pakshi, machhlee, hwel, keet aadi jantusamoohon kaa ullekh kiya he or chote samoohon ke liye colioptera or dyptera aadi shabdon kaa bhi prayog kiya he
 The botanists of this time were ahead of Aristotle's ideology
 unhone sthaneey paudhon kaa safal vargeekaran kar rakhaa tha
 Brunfels and Bauhin were scientists on the successful path of plant taxonomy, but the experts of this time classifying animals were still working under Aristotle's ideology
 janvigyaan visheshgyon main jon re pratham vyakti the, jinhone jati or vansh main antar spasht kiya or pracheen vaigyanikon main ye pratham the, jinhone ucchtar prakritik vargeekaran kiya

 linius ne is disha main adwitiya kaary kiya
 Therefore, they are considered to be the father of classification science

 isliye is samay lambii jalayatraayen hui
 Animals from far away were studied and their offspring and family etc
 were studied

 During this period, great progress was made in taxonomy and many new castes, lineages and clans were added to the classification

 According to Haxley, modern taxonomy is a synthesis of geography, ecology, extracellular and genetics etc

 Linnaeus created five such categories: prayek shrenee main ek athwa ek se adhik neeche str ke samooh sammilit hote hai or ve nimna shrenee banaate hai
 Similarly each successive category belongs to one or more higher category
 ye shreniyan prakritik prabhed kam karke ek vyapak pranali bana detii hai
 With the development of knowledge, the number of these categories increased
 jagat or varg ke bich sangh or gana tathaa vansh ke bich main kutumb naamak shreniyan jodi gai
 According to Linnaeus, the species is an alternative category, which includes geographical or individual variation
 is tarah ab nimna saat shreniyan ho gai hai : For a more accurate interpretation of the classification, these categories are also divided into other categories
 adhiktar mul naam ke pehle adhi athwa up upsargon ko jodakar in shreniyon kaa namakaran kiya gaya he
 For example, precepts and subgroups etc
 unchi shreniyon ke liye kai naam prastaavit kiye gaye, parantu saamaanya prayog main ve nahin aate
 Only the primitive caste is used between the family and the clan
 kuch lekhakon ne, jaise simpasan, ne gana or varg ke bich sahagan naam kaa prayog kiya he
 In this way, the number of commonly used categories is presently as follows: vartmaan samay main 'anterrashtriya namakaran code' dwaara jeevon ke vargeekaran kii saat shreniyan paribhaashit kii gayi hai
 These categories are - Jagat, Sangha, class, Gana, clan, clan and caste
 In recent years, another level called domain has come into vogue which is placed above the 'world'

 Categories can also be created between the seven main categories, for which prefixes 'adhi-', 'sub-' or 'infra-' should be used

 Initial manufacturer interactions emerged as "factory teams" or "works teams", such as the team of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault
 In fact, after the disappearance by the early 1980s, factory teams began to operate in the 1990s and Returned in the 2000s and formed half of the grid with either Ferrari, Jaguar BMW, Renault, Toyota and Honda either establishing their own teams or purchasing existing teams

 kaaron kii banaavat aam taur par kam se kam kii tulane main bhi halaki hoti he or isliye ve kam se kam vajan kaa boj uthaane main sakasham hote hai
 Race teams take advantage of this burden by placing it at the very bottom of the chassis, thereby placing the center of gravity as low as possible to improve handling and weight transfer
 formula van ke kaaron kii modane kii gati ko zyaadaatar vayugatikeey nimnabal dwaara nirdhaarit kiya jaataa he jise ve utpann karte hai jo car ko trek par dhakelta he
 This is provided by the "wings" located at the front and rear of the vehicle and the low pressure under the car's flat bottom

 Another major factor controlling the turning speed of cars is the design of tires

 Instead, each tire had four large peripheral grooves on its surface that were designed to limit the speed of turning cars

 Even with limitations on aerodynamics, the aerodynamically driven downforce at 160 km / h is equal to the weight of the car and the repeated claims that Formula One cars produce significantly lower weight when "driving at altitude", while the theory Is possible, has never been put to the test
 car ke vajan se 2
5 guna nimnabal ko punav gati par praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 The downforce means that cars can achieve a lateral force of magnitude 3
5 times the force of gravity at the time of turning
 natijatan, mode ke samay 20 kilon ke vajan ke baraabar ke ek bal ke saath driver kaa sir agal-bagal khinchaa jaataa he
 This much lateral force is enough to create difficulty in breathing and the driver needs the highest concentration and fitness to maintain his focus for one to two hours to complete the race

 Formula One went through a difficult situation in the early 2000s
 The dominance of Michael Schumacher and Scuderia Ferrari led to a decrease in viewership and fans expressed their reluctance
 Since 2005, there are some signs of improvement in the condition of the viewing public due to various seasons

 To this end, the FIA has made a number of changes to the rules, including new tire restrictions, multi-race engines, and reduction in blankets

 The rapid expansion of the game in new areas of the globe of the Earth also leaves some questions about which races will be cut

 During the early 2000s, Formula One Group created numerous trademarks, an official logo, and an official website for this in an effort to give it a corporate identity
 iklestone ne ek digital television package ke saath prayog kiya jise 1967 ke german grand pricks main pehle GP rangeen TV prasaaran ke tees saal baad german digital television seva "DF1" ke sahyog se 1996 ke german grand pricks main shuru kiya gaya
 The service provided viewers with a number of contemporary feeds that were manufactured with the help of cameras, technical equipment, and staff aside from the equipment used for traditional coverage
 ise saal dar saal kai deshon main shuru kiya gaya lekin vittiya kaarnon kii vajah se 2002 ke satr ke baad band kar diya gaya
 TV stations receive what is known as the "world feed", whether it is produced by the FOM or sometimes by the "host broadcaster"
 "premiere" was the only station that really differed from it — a German channel that offered all sessions live and interactive as well as an onboard channel
 yah seva 2002 ke ant tak adhik vyapak rup se europe bhar main uplabdh tha, jab digital sanvadatmak sevaaon ke ek sampoorn alag sambharan kii laagat haalanki bahut adhik thi
 This was in large part due to the failure of the "F1 Digital +" channel launched through Sky Digital in the United Kingdom

 However, at the beginning of its coverage for the 2009 season, the BBC relaunched complementary features such as the "red Button" in-car camera angle, multiple soundtracks, and a rolling highlights package

 BBC, digital sthaliy platformon ke "red batan" sanvadatmak sevaaon par ek post-res program kaa bhi prasaaran karata he jise "F1 forum" kehete hai
 Bernie Ecclestone had announced that F1 would adopt the HD format near the end of the 2007 season
 a subsequent announcement made in early 2008 claimed that the BBC would broadcast F1 for five years from 2009, taking over from ITV which had been broadcasting it since 1997
 haalanki, 31 disambar 2008 ko BBC sport ke diarector roger mose ne ghoshnaa kii ki FA kaa prasaaran BBC HD par nahin kiya jayega kyonki "koi bhi HD world feed uplabdh nahin he"

 Biondetti actually competed in four Formula One races in 1950, but only one of them was counted for the World Championship

 One example of the most recent "formula One race" was the 2005 United States Grand Prix, among the races that have been denied the status of "world Championship Race"
 20 main se 14 driveron ne apane michelin tiron kii samasya ke kaaran racing nahin kii or is samasya kaa ek upyukt samaadhaan dhund nikaalane main asafal hone kii vajah se ek gaiyr-championships res kii mejabani karne ke samjhaute main 10 main se 9 team shesh rah gaye
 It was only because Ferrari refused to follow through on these plans that this failure resulted, although it was said that Mosley had informed Mr
 Martin, the most senior representative of the FIA in the USA, that If some kind of non-championship race was conducted, or there was some kind of change in the circuit, then all of the US Grand Prix and indeed the FIA regulations in the US Cloud Mnderaange danger on Otrsport
 The same Stodart edition of the competitions was published on the same day, the FIA issued a statement denying that Mosley had allegedly threatened or had any such conversation

 But gravitational waves produced by objects with low mass and low acceleration are so weak that they are very difficult to measure
 koi vastu jitani adhik dravyashaalee hogi or uskaa twaran jitna adhik hoga, vah utana hi adhik shaktisaali gurtviya tarange bhi paidaa karegi
 For example, in the universe, these gravitational waves are created when a very massive celestial body rapidly rises and explodes in its last state of life

 In the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin gave the scientific theory of evolution through natural selection
 unhone ise apni kitaab jeevajati kaa udbhav main prakashit kiya
 The process of evolution by natural selection can be proved by the following observations: 1) more offspring are born than they can possibly survive, 2) the population has a variety of morphological, physical, and behavioral traits, 3) Different traits provide different chances of post-life and reproduction, and 4) traits are given from one generation to the next
 is prakaar, peedi dar peedi aabaadi un shakson kii santanon dwaara pratisthapit ho jaati he jo us baiophisical parivesh ke behatar anukulit hon
 The process of natural selection creates and retains traits with this virtual purpose that fit its functional role

 In contrast to these physical ideas, Aristotelianism regarded all natural things as the real forms of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms
 yah prakruti kii ek madhyayugin doorsanchaar kii samaj kaa hissaa tha jisamen sabhi vastuon kaa ek divya brahmadia kram main khilne ke liye ek mahatvapurn bhoomika he
 Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real-type creatures always conform to each other for true spiritual forms, and especially new types

 In the 17th century, the new method of modern science rejected the Aristotlean view

 However, this new approach was slow to take root in biological science, the last bastion of the concept of definite natural types

 The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognized the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still in view of species determined according to a divine plan
 is samay ke anya prakrutivaadee samay par prakritik kanoonon ke anusaar prajatiyon ke vikasvaadi parivartan par anumaan lagaate hai
 In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertus wrote about the natural modifications that occur during breeding and accumulated over many generations to produce new species
 georges-louis leclerrk, comate di bamphone ne suzav diya ki prajatiyaan alag-alag jeevon main bighad sakati hai, or irasmus darwin ne prastaav kiya tha ki sabhi garm rakt vaale jaanavar ek hi sookshmjeev se utar sakate the
 The first fully developed development plan was jean-baptiste Lemarck's "transformation" theory of 1809, in which healthy generations consistently created simpler forms of life that developed more complexity with a progressive tendency inherent in parallel lineages, and localized At the level, these lineages can be adapted to the environment due to changes in their use or absence in the parents

 In particular, George Cuvre asserted that species are unrelated and determined, their similarities reflect divine design for functional needs
 Meanwhile, William Paly developed Red's ideas into natural theology or the god of existence and existence of Christians
 , Which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and was praised by Charles Darwin Did

 Partially influenced by an essay on the theory of population by Thomas Robert Malthus, Darwin stated that population growth can lead to a "struggle for survival" in which favorable variation prevails as others die

 It can explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common lineage through the work of natural laws in the same way for all types of organisms

 The mechanisms of reproductive heredity and the origin of new traits remained a mystery
 is disha main, darwin ne pengenesis ke apana asthaayee siddhant viksit kiya
 In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that the elements were inherited in a predictable manner through independent classification and separation elements
 mandaal ke viraasat ke kanoonon ne antat darwin ke sabase adhik pengensis siddhant kii purti kii
 August Weismann has significant differences between germ cells that give rise to gametes and somatic cells of the body, showing that heredity only passes through the germ line

 De Wills was also one of the researchers who made Mendel's work well known, assuming that Mendelian traits correspond to the transfer of genetic changes at the germline

 In 1973, the evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobhansky wrote that "nothing in biology leaves the light of evolution", because it brought to light the earlier relationship to the contradictory facts of those natural relations, a knowledge of which Explains in clear explanatory body and many observational facts about life on this planet have been speculated

 For example, alleles become more common for blacks in a population of moths
 Mechanisms that can alter allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation, and gene flow

 For example, if an organism could survive well and breed quickly, but its descendants were too young and vulnerable to survive, this organism would have little genetic contribution to future generations and thus less There will be fitness
 yadi aleble us jin ke anya eliljon se adhik fitness badhaata he, to prayek peedi ke saath yah elil aabaadi ke bheetar adhik saamaanya ho jayega

 Natural selection within a population for a trait, which can vary on a variety of values such as elevation, can be classified into three different types
 The first is directional selection, which over time is associated with a particular trait
 The average value changes — for example, organisms gradually become higher
 duusare, vighatnkaaree chayan atyadhik gun mulyon ke liye chayan hota he or aksar do alag-alag mulyon main sabase aam ho jaataa he, ausat mulya ke khilaaf chayan ke saath
 This will happen when either miniature or high organisms have an advantage, but not of medium height
 Finally, stabilizing selection involves choosing between extreme characteristics on either side, which is the average value and low diversity
 Reduces the variance around

 Purvanshi Udayan Vats was the king of the kingdom
 unki rajdhani kaa naam kaushambi tha
 At the same time, in the Avanti kingdom, whose capital was Ujjayini, a king named Pradyot ruled
 maharaj pradyot ek atyant vishaal sainya-bal ke swami the isaliye unhen mahasen ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa tha
 Maharaj Udayan had a divine veena named Ghoshavati
 unka veena-vaadan apurv tha
 Once Pradyot's Amatya Shalankayan tricked and imprisoned Udayan
 udayan ke veena-vaadan kii khyaati sunakar pradyot ne unhe apni putree vaasavadatta ke liye veena-shikshak niyukt kar diya
 During this, Madhyana became enlightened towards each other in Udayan and Vasavadatta
 idhar udayan ke mantri yaugandharayan unhen kaid se chhudaane ke prayaas main the
 Udayan, with Yugandharayana's tact, succeeded in escaping from Ujjayini, taking Vasavadatta with him and came to Kaushambi and married Vasavadatta
 udayan vaasavadatta ke prem main itane khoye rahane lage ki unhen raaj-kaary kii sudhi hi nahin rahi
 Taking advantage of this situation, his cruel enemy named Aruni snatched his kingdom from him
 aaruni se udayan ke rajya ko waapas lene ke liye unke mantri yaugandharayan or rumnavan prayatnsheel ho gayi
 But Aruni could not be defeated without the help of another state
 vaasavadatta ke pita pradyot udayan se naaraaz the or yaugandharayan ko unase kisi prakaar kii ummid nahin thi
 Yoongandharayana finds out through astrologers that the king whom magadha-naresh's sister Padmavati will marry will become Chakravarti emperor
 yaugandharayan ne sochaa ki yadi kisi prakaar se padmavati kaa vivaah udayan se ho jaye to udayan ko avashya hi unka vatsa rajya aaruni se waapas mil jaayegaa saath hi ve chakravarti samraat bhi ban jaayenge
 Yoongandharayan told Vasavadatta about his plan to get Maharaj Udayan married with Padmavati
 pati kii mangalakamna chaahane vaali vaasavadatta is vivaah ke liye raji ho gayi
 But Yoongandharayana knew well that Udayan loved his wife Vasavadatta infinitely and would never agree to his second marriage
 atev unhone vaasavadatta or ek anya mantri rumnavan ke saath milakar ek yojana banaai
 According to the plan, Udayan was sent along with the royal family and confidant colleagues to the forest for hunting, where they all started living in the camp
 ek din, jab udayan mrugaya ke liye gaye hue the, shivi main aag laga di gai
 On Udayan's return, Rumwan told him that Vasavadatta was trapped in the fire in the camp and that Yoondandharayana entered the place where both of them died
 udayan is samachar se atyant duhkhi hue kintu rumnvan tathaa anya amaatyon ne anekon prakaar se santvanaa dekar unhen sambhaala
 Here, Yogandharayan, taking Vasavadatta as a Parivrajak, reached Magadha Rajputri Padmavati and placed the disguised Vasavadatta as a heritage near Padmavati
 avantika padmavati kii vishesh anugrah paatr ban gayi
 He praised Maharaj Udyan and attracted Padmavati towards him
 udayan doosraa vivaah nahin karnaa chaahate the kintu rumnavan ne unhen samajha-buja kar padmavati se vivaah ke liye raji kar liya
 Thus Udayan was married to Padmavati
 vivaah ke pashchaat magadh-naresh kii sahaayta se udayan ne aaruni par akraman kar diya or use parrast kar apana rajya waapas le liya
 In the end, in a very dramatic way Yugandharayana and Vasavadatta revealed themselves
 yaugandharayan ne apni dhristataa evam dussahas ke liye kshamaa nivedan kiya
 In one scene of this play, Udayan rests in the sea
 ve swapn main ‘ha vaasavadatta’, ‘ha vaasavadatta’ pukaarte rahete hai usee samay avantika vahaan pahunch jaati hai
 They leave their hanging hands on the bed, but at the same time Udayan sleep opens
 ve nishchay nahin kar pate ki unhone vastav main vaasavadatta ko dekha he athwa swapn main
 Due to this incident, the play was named 'swapnavasavadatta'
 carch shabd unani visheshan kaa apbhransh he jiskaa shabdic arth he "prabhu kaa"
 In fact, the Church is used in two ways; One is the building of the Lord that is the Church and the other is the organization of Christians
 carch ke atirikt 'kalisia' shabd bhi chalata he
 It is a distorted form of the word 'ecclesia' in the Greek Bible; In the Bible it means - a local or community of Christians around the world
 baad main yah shabd girjaghar ke liye bhi prayukt hone laga
 Here the church will be considered in the sense of institution
 sabhi isai praaia: is baat se sahamat hai ki isa ne keval ek hi carch kii sthapana kii thi, kintu anek kaarnon se isaayiyon kii ekta akshunn nahin rah saki
 As a result, many of their churches or organizations exist today, which are completely independent of each other
 unka vargeekaran is prakaar kiya ja saktaa he : In the early centuries of Christianity, little has been done about the definition and form of the Church
 bible main isa kii jeevani tathaa shiksha kaa jo varnan he usase spasht he ki prarambh hi se isaayiyon kaa vishwaas tha ki is ne samast maanav jati ke liye mukti ke sadhano ko sulabh kar diya or is uddeshy se prithvi par "ishwar kaa rajya" sthapit kiya
 The "kingdom of God" is a community of people who believe in the divinity of Jesus and receive his teachings
 bible main us samudaay ko "ishwar ko praja" kaha gaya he
 For his organization and rule, Jesus selected 12 disciples and gave them special teaching and authority and ordered them to go around the world to preach their teachings and baptize believers into the church
 is prakaar bible main isa ke anuyaayiyon ke samudaay ko carch, "ishwar kaa rajya" tathaa "ishwar kii praja" kaha gaya he
 From these positions it may appear that initially the actual form of the church has been considered limited to external organization, but this is not the case
 isa ne apni shiksha main isapar bal diya he ki unamem tathaa unke sachche anuyaayiyon main adrishy evam rahasyatmak ekta he
 He said to his disciples- "I take the vine and you are the branches
" " isse spasht ho jaataa he ki carch kaa sabase mahatvapurn tatv aadhyatmik hi he
 Saint Paul has laid great emphasis on this spiritual and mystic aspect of the church
 isa tathaa unke sachche anuyaayiyon kaa aadhyatmik sambandh or isa ke sabhi anuyaayiyon kii rahasyamay ekta ko spasht karne ke liye unhone apane patron main barambar carch ko "isa kaa aadhyatmik sharir" kaha he 
 Hence, from the beginning both the external organization of the church and its spiritual form have been taken care of
 protestant dharm ke kaaran carch main foot padi to dharmacharya carch ke swaroop par adhik chintan karne lage
 Protestant scholars put more emphasis on the invisible form of the church and in response to the Catholic Church's outward organization of the church, its visible membership, etc
 is vivaad main unhone carch ke chaar bahari lakshanon kaa apekshaakrit adhik mahatv diya he
 The true Church of Christ is Catholic; One is, in the bondage of love, all its members believe in the principles of religion
 ek sanskaar, ek si pujanapaddati or ek hi parmadhikari kaa shashan sweekaar karte hai; pavitra he ; apozels he The visible organization of the church may also include some people who are hypocrites who have no spiritual connection with Jesus, who are not part of Jesus' spiritual body
 ishwar hi jaanata he ki koun carch kaa sachcha sadsy he or is kaaran yah mana ja saktaa he ki vaastavik carch adrishy hi he
 Even then, the sacraments are the essential condition of full membership of that invisible real church, so cannot be separated from the invisible church
 aajkal praaia: sabhi protetianst bhi is baat ko maanate hai
 Even though full membership of the Church is required for salvation, it is not compulsory
 ishwar sabhi logon kii mukti chahta he or sab manushyon ke ant:karan main satprerana utpann karata he
 Those who follow the inspiration of God inadvertently become imperfect members of the Church invisibly and can achieve salvation provided by Jesus
 dwitiya mahayuddh ke pashchaat isai sansar main carch kii ekta ke andolan ko adhik mahatv diya jane laga
 Consequently, in an attempt to determine the true form of the church based on the elements existing in the Bible, excluding rebuttal, the emphasis was on the fact that the church is the spiritual body of Jesus
 isa uskaa sheersh he or sachche isai us sharir ke ang hai

 After the death of Jesus, his disciples started preaching Christianity among Jews and non-jews

 Apart from this, people could not live without being influenced by the spirit of Christianity

 Although the Roman rulers viewed the new religion with skepticism from the beginning and persecuted its followers, it was only in the third century that a complete attempt was made to completely eradicate the Christian religion, especially Desius, Diocliction, In the reigns of the Muskminians and Gallerius

 In the civil war that ensued for the successor after the renunciation of Dioclution, Constantine was victorious and he gave freedom to all religions by taking out the edict of Milan in 313 AD
 us samay ariyas ke mat ke kaaran isai sansar main ashaanti failane lagi thi
 To overcome this, Constantine organized the first World Assembly of the Catholic Church; This assembly of Nicaea declared in opposition to Aureus's belief that Jesus is God in real sense

 Towards the end of that century, the first real Christian emperor Theodosius declared Christianity as a religion; He also controlled the followers of Aureus and for that purpose organized the Second World Assembly of the Catholic Church in Küstüntunia
