 When a passenger books a guide book, the traveler or travel website user creates a PNR in the computer reservation system that they use

 This PNR is called Master PNR for the traveler and associated guide book

 When portions of the journey are not provided by the holder of the master PNR, copies of the PNR information are sent to the CRS of the airlines that provide the transportation

 From a technical level, five parts of a PNR are required before completing a booking
 ve hai: Once the booking is completed to this level, CRS operates a unique alpha-numeric record locator, which will be split regardless of any further changes made
 Each airline will create its own booking record with a specific record locator, depending on the level of agreement between the associated airline and the CRS, which will be transmitted to the CRS and stored in the booking

 While the minimum data required to complete a booking is small enough, a PNR will usually have more information of a sensitive nature
 This includes the passenger's full name, date of birth, home and work address, telephone number, e-mail address
 , Credit card details as well as the names and personal information of emergency contacts

 There are several types of pits for making silage
 gonvon main saillej banane ke liye khattiyon kaaphi suvidhajanak or upyogi hoti he
 The size of the pit depends on the number of available feed and animals

 And they should be attached with a layer of dry fodder or polythene along the walls
 jis chaare kaa saillej bananaa he use kaat kar thodi der ke liye khet main sukhaane ke liye chod dena chahie
 When the moisture in the feed remains around 70 percent, it should be cut into small pieces with a cutting machine and pressed into the pits and filled
 chote gaddhon ko aadmi pairo se dabaa sakate hai jabaki bade gadde tractor chalaakar dabaa dene chahie
 Stuffing should be done till the height of the ground is stacked about one meter high
 bharaai ke baad upar se gumbadakaar bana den or polithin yaa sookhe ghaas se dhak kar mitti acchhee tarah dabaa den or upar se lipai kar den taaki is main baahar se pani tathaa vaayu aadi na ja sake
 The pits should open three months after filling
 kholte samay dhyaan rakhen ki saillej ek taraf se paraton main nikaala jaae or gadde kaa kuch hissaa hi kholaa jaae tathaa baad main use dhak den
 After opening the pit, silage should be finished by feeding the animals as soon as possible
 gadde ke upari bhaagon or deevaaron ke paas main kuch fafundi lag jaati he
 Keep in mind that such silage should not be fed to animals
 sabhi prakaar ke pashuon ko saillej khilaayaa ja saktaa he
 One part dry feed, one part silage should be fed and if there is a shortage of green fodder, then the amount of silage can be increased
 saillej banane ke 30-35 din baad saillej khilaayaa ja saktaa he
 a normal animal can be fed 20–25 kg silage per day
 dudharu pashuon ko saillej doodh nikaalane ke baad khilaayen taaki doodh main saillej kii gandh na aa sake
 It has been observed that good silage contains nutrients equal to 85-90 percent green fodder
 isliye chaare kii kami ke samay saillej khilaakar pashuon ko doodh utpaadan badhaaya ja saktaa he

 karl marks tathaa maiks webar ke saath ve bhi aadhunik samaaj vigyaan ke mukhya shilpi evam samajashaastra ke janak kahe jate hai
 David Emile Durkheim is considered the founder of modern sociology and the first official sociologist in the world in sociological terms
 adhyayan kii vishvavidhyalayan vyavastha main ve samajashaastra ke pehle profesar bhi the
 In the three decades of his academic life, he not only established sociology as a specific discipline, but also laid the theoretical and methodological ground of this discipline
 durkhime kii samajashastreey sankalpana kaa vidheyak tatva manushya ko saamaajik sambandhon kaa parinaam maanata he
 For this reason Durkheim's sociology refuses to recognize any form of individualism in its infrastructure
 manushya kii iyatta ko samaaj kii upaj maanane ke sandarbh main durkhime comt, marks, webar aadi saamaajik chintakon ke nazadik baithte hai
 It is important to consider that the person is the product of the society and giving central importance to the social phenomenon itself gives sociology a distinct form compared to other disciplines
 samajashaastra kii yah vishistataa durkhime ke bina sambhav nahin thi
 Although Durkheim has also thought intensively on issues ranging from thinkers like Montescue and Rousseau to pragmatism, socialism and moral education, his four works in the field of sociology - 'the Division of Labor', 'the Rules of Socioeconomic Method', ' Suicide 'and' The Elementary Forms of the Release's Life 'are considered most important
 david emil durkhime kaa janm apinal, loren ke ek francisi yahudee parivaar main hua tha
 Both his father and grandfather were rabbis
 unki shuruaati shiksha bhi ek dharmik skool main hui, lekin jivan ke shuru main hi unhone puri tarah se secular jivan guzaarane kaa nishchay kiya
 As an undergraduate student, he enrolled in the renowned Ecol Normale Superiorie and in 1886, as part of his doctorate, he created 'the Division of Labor in Society'
 is rachana main durkhime aadhunik or parmparik samaajon kaa fark dikhaate hue yah pratipaadit karte hai ki aadhunik samaaj jahaan shram ke vishesheekaran par aadhaarit hota he vahiin parmparik samaaj saajhe vishwaason par chalata he
 According to him, this difference of forms of society also reflects the difference in the system of rules
 is tarah aadhunik samaaj swa- niyaman se sanchalit hota he jabaki parmparik samaaj ke niyam bahari vishwaason or anumodan par tike hote hai
 According to Durkheim, since shared beliefs rest on the authority of common morality, a system based on these beliefs can only be sustained through power and pressure
 jabaki swaniyamkaari yaa aadhunik samaaj swatantraaa, samanta tathaa nyaay jaise tattvon ke bina santulit nahin rah saktaa
 Scholars believe that this formulation of looking at the diversity of social forms by linking them to specific frameworks of rules has been a fundamental driving force for sociological studies of crime and law
 durkhime maanate the ki samaaj ke parmparik or aadhunik roopon main vibhram ke kaaran tathaa aadhunik samaajon par parmparik kanoon yaa niyam thopane kii pravriti hi kai saamaajik samasyaon ke liye jimmedaar rahi he
 This interpretation of modern societies is considered a distinct achievement of Durkheim's work
 is rachana main durkhime vyakti ke saamaajik saahchary yaa judaav kaa vishleshan karte hue yah vichaar bhi rakhte hai ki vyakti ko khaas tarah kii saamaajik saahchary kii zarurat padati he
 Durkheim shows that within social institutions there is an element of self which demands a certain behavior from its partners
 durkhime isiilie is baat par jor dete the ki vyakti ke bajaay saamaajik prakriyaaon kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie
 According to him the concrete form of these social processes is expressed in institutions and behavior which can also be studied on the basis of monitoring
 durkhime in prakriyaaon ko soshal facts yaa saamaajik tathyon kii sangya dete hai
 Durkheim is also credited with the creative use of statistics in sociological studies
 is sambandh main unki rachana suiside ek maanak kii tarah sthapit he
 In this work Durkheim proposed that different rates of suicide can be interpreted on the basis of differences in the individual's levels of social affiliation
 masalan, unhone dikhaaya ki vyakti kii nijee pravritiyon ke aadhaar par is baat kaa andaaza nahin lagaaya ja saktaa ki umrdaraj purush hi kyon aatmahatya karte hai
 But if the factors of a person's social status such as his being unmarried or his isolation from society, etc
, the cause of suicide can be identified
 durkhime apane adhyayan main sankhyikee kaa istemaal saamaajik tathyon jaise kisi samooh ke sadasyon ke aapasi saahchary ke roopon kii takat yaa charitra ujagar karne ke liye karte hai
 For example, if the feeling of mutual companionship is weak in a group, then there will be more chances of moral or psychological problems in its members
 iske ulat agar kisi samooh main saahchary kii bhaavana bahut gahari ho to uske sadsy apane samooh ke liye tyaag karne ke liye zyaada tatpar paye jaaenge
 Durkheim's other work, 'the Rules of Socioecological Method', is considered to be the cornerstone of the methods used in sociology
 is rachana main durkhime spasht karte hai ki samajashaastra kii kendriya vishay- vastu saamaajik vyavastha he, lihaaza usamen vyakti ke bajaay samaaj ke saansthanik or vyavasthaagat roopon ko pramukhataa di jaani chahie
 In this composition Durkheim describes sociology as a study of such social facts
 unke anusaar in saamaajik tathyon ke bich ek khaas tarah kii sangati hoti he jise keval unke nirmaankari anshon kaa sanchit parinaam nahin kaha ja saktaa
 In his work Suicide, Durkheim wanted to clarify the same point that even a private phenomenon like suicide can be explained on the basis of people's associative relationships and social bonding
 unki daleel thi ki vyakitgat bhavanaaen, mulya yaa vichaar jaisi chijen vastav main saamaajik sahabhaagita se hi upajati hai
 Durkheim's two compositions, 'the Division of Labor' and 'the Elementary Forms of the Religious Life', are known to use modern approaches to the then social order
 aadhuniktaa ke samajashastreey vimarsh main ye donon rachanaayen apane baarik or saghan adhyayan ke kaaran aaj bhi ek anivaary sandarbh bani hui hai
 Durkheim's contemplation was modern in a deep sense
 froid jaise manovishleshak bhi apane samay ke purvagrahon se mukt nahin ho paye the or apni kriti totum and tabu main aadim dimaag kii tulana maansik rogi se kar baithe the, jabaki durkhime ne apni rachana alementary forms of da relijas life main yah pratipaadit kiya ki tarkbuddhi ke lihaaz se aadim kabeelon kii saamaajik sanrachanaayen or vishwaas aadhunik manushya kii tarkbuddhi se kamatar nahin tehraye ja sakate
 This was a bold idea given the political ramifications prevailing in Durkheim's time
 chunki durkhime tarkbuddhi ko saamaajik utpaada maanate hai isiilie manushya ko kamatar yaa shreshthatar sabit karne vaale vichaar ko ve sire se kaarij kar dete hai
 Durkheim's intervention has equipped sociology with a basic egalitarianism
 ukt rachana main dharm kii saamaajik upyogita par vichaar karte hue durkhime yah daleel pesh karte hai ki manushya dharmik reeti-rivaazon tathaa karmkandon main bhagidaari ke zariye hi maanviya tarkbuddhi ke buniyadi roopon- spes, samay, vargeekaran, shakti, kaary-kaaran kii samaj tathaa sampoornataa kaa bodh arjeet karata he
 Durkheim also introduces the idea that the social experience of purity gives rise to social interrelations
 unke mutabik saamaajik vyakti kaa janm tathaa tarkbuddhi kaa vikaas bhi isi prakriya se nirast hota he
 Durkheim also says in this work that all concepts originate from society
 isliye tark, bhashaa or arth kii samaj viksit karne ke liye is baat kaa adhyayan kiya janaa chahie ki shabdon or avadharanaon kaa kin saamaajik roopon or sandarbhon main istemaal kiya gaya he
 Here, Durkheim describes religion as a function of society and makes another important formulation that religion is a means of maintaining social order
 durkhime dharmik vishwaason kii satyata ko sidhe to nahin nakaarte lekin unke liye dharm kaa satya uski is kshamta se tay hota he ki vah karmkandon ko protsaahit kar saktaa he yaa nahin
 According to him, organized religions cannot be understood only on the basis of beliefs, because such religions are often found while suppressing personal faith to keep traditional forms of society intact
 aadhunik or parmparik samaajon main dharm kii bhoomika ko lekar durkhime kaa yah sutara bhi kaabile gaur he ki samaaj kii in do alag kismon main dharm ke prakaarya ek jaise nahin hote
 Religion is a tool of social control in traditional societies whereas in modern societies its function becomes non-essential because in modern societies it becomes a function of knowledge and epistemology
 isiilie saamaajik vyavastha main uski bhoomika pehle jaisi nahin rah jaati
 Durkheim's conclusion that sociopolitical thinking would be considered an achievement is that the phenomenon of a human being transforming from a biological being to a social animal cannot be explained on the basis of one's biological abilities or psychology
 unki daleel he ki jaivik kaa saamaajik main roopantaran saamaajik prakriyaaon ke madhyam se sampann hota he
 Therefore, Durkheim feels that the opinion that the mind and body are called two separate rights, only shows the difference between biological existence and social animal standing outside the process of society
 unke anusaar pehali avasthaa ke praani ko rashnal manushya nahin kaha ja saktaa
 They also emphasize that in human beings, things like rationality or personality arise from the process of society itself
 durkhime kaa mat tha ki manushya ko ek saamaajik praani ke rup main banaaye rakhane ke liye saamaajik prakriyaaon or saahchary ke khaas roopon kii darkaar hoti he
 That is, a social man cannot be seen apart from his fixed social configuration and context
 isliye durkhime aagaah bhi karte hai ki agar manovigyaan, arthshaastra yaa darshanashastra ke adhyayan kii koi paddati saamaajik parighatna ko keval vyaktiyon kii sanchit gatividhiyon ke aadhaar par samajhane kaa upkram karti he to use samaaj jaise sabase mahatvapurn paksh ko darkinar karne kaa doshi samajha janaa chahie
 hgfrtew Despite egalitarianism's apparent reputation in Durkheim's contemplation and work, feminist analysts say she has not paid enough attention to the issue of women
 ek had tak yah baat sahi he ki samajashastri ke taur par durkhime kii koi bhi rachana stri-paksh par ekagra nahin he
 But at the time of the nineteenth century when Durkheim was organizing sociology, very few social thinkers were considering the questions of women
 suiside main unhone aatmahatya kii ek bhagyavaadee kism kaa zikr kiya he jise ve mukhyatah striyon ke saath jod kar dekhte hai
 Durkheim also thought that marriage is beneficial for men but it has a negative effect on the lives of women
 da divizan of lebar main durkhime muulavaasiyon ke hawaale se bataate hai ki aise samudaayon main striyon kii saamaajik sthiti purushon ke mukaable kamatar nahin thim jabaki iske ulat aadhunik samaajon main stri kii haisiyat kamazor hoti gayi he
 The average tendency of erstwhile society portrayed the woman as soft and weak
 ise dekhte hue durkhime kii drushti nishchay hi agragami kahi jaaegi
 Durkheim's contribution has been a matter of inspiration, questioning, inclusion and cross-examination for many generations of sociologists
 tees ke dashak main talcott parcens ne durkhime ke krititv ko sanrachanaatmak prakaaryawad main sametane kaa prayaas kiya
 As a result, Durkheim's contribution to America began to be viewed through formalism and positivism
 jabaki frans main unki drushti kaa levi-stros jaise maanavshastriyon ne upyog kiya jinaki dilchaspee durkhime dwaara pratipaadit sankalpanaaon, vichaaron or samaaj ke antarsambandhon ke aadhaar par ek pratikwaadi maanavshaastra rachane main thi
 But this venture to make a new interpretation based on Durkheim's ideas proved to be one-sided in that he used only certain parts of Durkheim's original preface
 marxvaadi dhara ke samajashastriyon ne apane lekhan main durkhime ke chintan main nihit radical swaroop ko mahatva dete hue parcens ke drushtikon ko pratisantulit karne kaa prayaas kiya he jo durkhime ko raajnneetik rup se roodhiwaadee sabit karne par jor detaa he
 a group of sociologists believe that Durkheim's sociology is secondary to the individual
 lekin dhyaan se dekhen to durkhime aisa iradatan karte hai
 His vision urges society to be understood as collectivism and emphasizes that the basic aim of sociology is to be synonymous with individualism if it does not pay attention to the investigation of social theories and the study of contradictions in the practice of sociology
 Is canceled
 durkhime ke tain samajashaastra kaa kaam yah nahin he ki vah darshanashastreey sandhan ke liye kachi saamagree muhaiyaa karaaye or phir is baat kaa intazaar kare ki darshanikon kaa khemaa apane moolyankan main kya kahata he
 On the other hand, Durkheim argues that sociology should formulate the criteria for the study of social facts
 unhone darshanashastriyon kii is daleel ko kaarij kar diya ki saamaajik tathyon main aakasmikta kaa tatva hota he
 While giving a well thought out response to this criticism, Durkheim said that certain types of and permanent forms are necessary to maintain the continuity of society

 Nagendra, referring to Premchand's era-promoter Awadan, writes: "prathamtah unhone hindi katha sahitya ko 'manoranjan' ke str se uthaakar jivan ke saath sarthak rup se jodne kaa kaam kiya
 Sprawling lives and many current problems


 inspired him to write novels
 " Premchand has chosen his characters from all walks of life, but his vision is more towards the neglected section of the society

 Their characters often come across as representative of the class

 murdhanya aalochak hajariprasad dvivedi likhte hai, "if you want to know the ethics, language, sentiment, hope, aspiration, sorrow and wisdom of all the people of North India, then you cannot get a better introduction than Premchand
 


 The world of hindi-urdu does not know the viewer who can show different dimensions of society more reliably than him
 But you will always aim for one thing
 Not who uncouth and uneducated, they are higher than those of self and show more respect for justice, who are educated, smart, who are worldly-wise who are urban
 yahi premchand kaa jivan-darshan he

 Similarly, the language of rural characters is rural
 or shikshiton kii bhashaa shuddh or parishkrut bhashaa he
 Dr
 Nagendra writes: "the specialty of the language of his novels is that he is called 'simple' and 'colloquial' in terms of choice of words and syntax
 par bhashaa kii is saralata ko nirjeevta, ekresata evam akavyatmakataa kaa paryaay nahin samajha janaa chahie
 "in the precise, meaningful and euphemistic use of language, he leaves behind not only his contemporaries, but also the later novelists
 dow nagendra likhte hai : "premchand instilled a spontaneous human interest in the innate common human trades by associating them with psychological conditions
 "shilp or bhashaa kii drushti se bhi premchand ne hindi upanyaas ko vishisht str pradaan kiya
 


 In the novel Hindi, Premchand used the exploration of the craft according to the illustrative theme

 'premchand ji's style is clearly marked by his personality
 premchand ke sarvaprasiddh maarmik upanyaas 'godaan' kaa climax dekhiye: When coriander touches the body of hori, it becomes heartburn
 mukh kantiheen ho gaya tha
 He said with a trembling voice - how is your life? hori ne asthir aankhon se dekha or bolaa -- tum aa gayi gobar? maine mangal ke liye gaay le lee he
 He stands, look
 dhaniya ne maut kii surat dekhi thi
 Used to recognize her
 use dabe paanv aate bhi dekha tha, aandhi kii tarah bhi dekha tha
 Mother-in-law died, father-in-law died in front of her, two of her children died, fifty people of the village died
 praan main ek dhakka-sa laga
 The ground on which life rests, as if it were being moved; But no, it is a time of patience, his doubts are pure, heat is on, and he is stunned
 umadte hue aansuon ko rokkar boli -- meri ore dekho, main hoon, dhaniya; mujhe nahin pahachaanate? Hori's consciousness returned
 mrityu sameep aa gayi thi; aag dahakanevaali thi
 The smoke had cooled down
 dhaniya ko deen aankhon se dekha, donon konon se ansu kii do boonden dhulak padin
 Said in a weak voice - i said sorry to hear the coriander! i go now gaay kii laalasaa man main hi rah gayi
 Now the rupees here will go into kiraya-karam
 ro mat dhinaya, ab kab tak jilaayegi? sab durdasha to ho gayi
 Now let's die or uski ankhen phir band ho gayin
 At the same time, Hira and Shobha reached with the doli
 hori ko uthaakar doli main litayaa or gaanv kii ore chale
 This news spread like air in the village
 sara gaanv jamaa ho gaya
 Hori might have seen everything on the cot, understood everything; But the tongue was closed
 haan, uski aankhon se behate hue ansu batala rahe the ki moh kaa bandhan todna kitna kathin ho rahaa he
 Whatever has not been created by itself, its sorrow is called attachment
 paale hue kartavya or nipataaye hue kaamon kaa kya moh! moh to un anathon ko chhod In going, with whom we could not perform our duty; There are incomplete plans which we could not fulfill
 magar sab kuch samajhakar bhi dhaniya aashaa kii mitati hui chaaya ko pakade hue thi
 Tears in eyes gir rahe the, magar yantra kii bhanti daud-daudkar kabhi aam bhun kar pana banaati, kabhi hori kii deh main gehun Would massage the husk
 kya kare, paise nahin hai, nahin kisi ko bhejkar doctor bulaati
 Heera crying kaha -- bhabhi, dil kadaa karo, go-daan kara do, dada chale
 Coriander looked at her with contemptuous eyes
 ab vah dil ko or kitna kathor kare? apane pati ke prati uskaa jo dharm he, kya vah usko Have to tell? What is the religion of life that is the cry of its name? or kai awaajen aayin -- haan go-daan kara do, ab yahi samay he
 Coriander arose like a machine, brought twenty money of the twine that was sold today and said to the donor standing in front of her husband in cold hands - Maharaj, there is no cow in the house, nor bed, nor money
 yahi paise hai, yahi inkaa go-daan he
 And fell backward

 sabhi maanate hai ki uttari saudi arab main jordan kii seemaa se yah shuru hote hai phir tat kii barabari main dakshin kii ore chalate hai
 Upon coming to Medina, it reduces and disappears, but only a short time later it starts again near Taif

 2012 ke chunaavon main ve apane nikatatam pratidwandvi ko 1759 voton ke antar se haraakar nirvaachit hue
 The alternator is an alternating current generating generator
 vastutah yah ek tulykaalik mashin he
 At present, power generation is done by alternators in most power plants
 samay ke saath saath bahut bade bade aakaar ke alternetr banane lagate hai
 Generators with a capacity of 50,000 to 1,50,000 kw are now common
 ye nirantar pravartan karanevaali mashine hai, isliye inaki sanrachana bhi atyant maanak aadhaar par hoti he
 Primarily, it is an automatic working machine and all its enforcement can be controlled by remote control
 kshetra dhara ke vicharan se voltata niyantran sugamawa se kiya ja saktaa he
 The investment is controlled by the load itself
 in sab kaarnon se vartmaan vidyut janitr bahut hi daksh evam vishwasaneey hote hai
 In fact, due to their reliable enforcement, it has been possible to make the electric current reliable
 jaise jaise vidyut kaa prayog badhata gaya, janitron kaa aakaar evam janit voltata main bhi vruddhi hoti gai
 But in the direct generators, it was not possible to greatly increase its size due to rotating armature
 isliye ucch voltata janit karanevaale prayavarti dhara ke janitr banaae gaye, jinamein armechar swaitik tha or kshetra paribhramanshil
 In fact, voltage generation does not require the conductor to move in a magnetic field
 ghoomte hue chumbakeey kshetra main sthit chaalak main bhi voltata prerit hogi, kyonki is dasha main bhi vah chumbakeey abhivah ko kaat rahaa he
 Hence, on this theory, the voltage can be generated by the static armature and the field of rotation
 yah voltata prayavarti praroop kii hogi or armechar chaalak tathaa kshetra kii saapeksh sthiti par nirbhar karegi
 Reversible current generators are, in general, based on the principle of static armature and rotating field
 inamen kshetra chumbak or kundaliyaan paribhramanshil banaai jaati hai tathaa armechar unako baahar se ghere hota he
 Conductors are located in the grooves in the armature
 armechar ke sthitik hone ke kaaran or baahar kii ore hone se, uskaa aakaar kaaphi badhaayaa ja saktaa he, jiskaa matlab he, usamen chaalak sankhya kaaphi adhik ho sakati he
 The field windings are relatively small and rotating at high velocity does not, in practice, pose any difficulty
 in kaarnon se prayavarti dhara janitron main ucch voltata janit karnaa sambhav he or ye saadharantaya 11,000 volt par pravartit kiye jate hai
 These generators have serpent rings in place of burush, which carry currents to excite the field coil
 kshetra ke paribhramanshil hone ke kaaran unhen disht dhara dwaara uttejan karnaa aavashyak he
 The excitation current is obtained either from an external source, or from a small direct current generator mounted on the same shaft, called the exciter
 uttejan voltata saadharantaya 110 athwa 220 volt hi hoti he
 All large generators are fed by the exciter so that no separate direct current source is required for the exciter
 prayavarti dhara janitron ko nirdhaarit veg par hi pravartan karnaa hota he, jo unamem janit voltata kii aavriti evam kshetra dhruvon kii sankhya par nirbhar karata he
 This can be expressed by the following equation: yahan n=parikraman prati minute, f=aavriti tathaa p=dhruv sankhya
 Thus, a four-polar machine for 50 cyclic frequency will act with a velocity of 1,500 revolutions per minute and a two-polar machine with a velocity of 3,000 revolutions per minute
 yadi nirdhaarit veg ek samaan rahaa, to aavriti main antar aa jayega
 In general, electric currents are of a specified voltage and frequency
 at: aavriti sthir rakhane ke liye janitr kaa veg eksaa na rakhana aavashyak he or yah veg uski dhruvasankhya ke anusaar nishchit hota he
 In India and other Commonwealth countries, the frequency of electrocution is generally fixed at 50 cycles per second
 america tathaa duusare deshon main 60 chakree aavriti prayog kii jaati he
 The velocity of the generators of different poles is also determined according to frequency, which is called synchronous velocity
 uparyukt aadhaar par, veg ke anusaar in janitron ke do mukhya praroop hote hai : ek to terbojanitr, jinhen vaashp tarabine se chalaaya jaataa he or ucch veg par pravartit karte hai tathaa duusare jalavidyut janitr, jo saamanyat: kam veg par pravartit kiye jate hai
 The velocity of some is up to 125 revolutions per minute
 inamen 50 chakree aavriti ke liye 48 dhruv hote hai
 The polarizer does not have more than 2 or 4 pole numbers
 bade janitron main keval 2 dhruv hi hote hai or ve 3,000 parikraman prati minute par pravartan karte hai
 Along with this difference, their composition also varies a lot
 adhik dhruvovali mashin kaa roter kaaphi bada hota he
 Its composition is similar to a conductive wheel, which is mounted on the spokes like a cycle wheel from the central part and the poles are all around in circularity
 ise salient dhruv vaala roter kehete hai
 In contrast, the rotor of a turbo generator is very long and cylindrical
 isamen dhruv nikle hue nahin hote, varan belanaakaar roter main bane khaanchon main avasthit kshetra kundaliyon dwaara banate hai
 This type of rotor is called cylindrical rotor or smooth rotor according to the shape
 terbojanitr ke ucch veg par pravartit karne ke kaaran, inamen vering ke snehan or sanvathan kii samasyaayen atyant mahatvapurn hoti hai
 Due to the heavy load on the bearings in hydroelectric generators and the application of lateral forces, the lubrication problem is complicated, but the ventilation itself becomes sufficient
 snehan ke liye tel pump dwaara tel chalanshil bhaagon main, jahaan snehan aavashyak hota he, daab ke saath bheja jaataa he
 The oil filter is also an essential accessory to clean oil
 snehan daab ghat jane par, mashin ke sakriy rup se band ho jane kii bhi vyavastha hoti he
 In turbogenerators, aeration is often used for ventilation
 armechar or roter main vahiniyaan is prakaar bani hoti he ki ek ore se hawa khinchakar in vahiniyon main hoti hui or mashin ko thandha karti hui duusari ore ko nikal jaati he
 This action is supported at high velocity, but in large generators it is not naturally ventilated enough and air is sent into the machine by pressure
 dhul or nami se mashin ko bachaane ke liye, sanvaahan kaa band tantra prayukt hota he
 In this, the same air is used repeatedly and when heated, it is cooled by an aerator and then sent to the machine for ventilation with pressure
 bade janitron main sanvathan ke liye vaayu ke sthaan par hydrogen gas kaa bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 Hydrogen is 14 times lighter than air
 at:, sanvathan ke liye ise prayog karne se vivy haani kam ho jaati he
 It is also a more effective medium of heat removal than air
 parantu vaayu ke saath milakar hydrogen visphotak ho saktaa he or ise bachaane ke liye paryaapt saavdhaanee rakhi jaati he
 Swami Govindananda Tirtha Ji Maharaj is a proven master of the Shaktipat tradition

 Swamiji, who had been the principal in the past, has changed his life by teaching about eight hundred people in the Shaktipat tradition till now
 29 oktober san 1923 ko somvaar ke din chandramaa zamin par utar aayaa tha
 There is a village in Morena District of Madhya Pradesh - Kasamda village falls under Kasmadah Ambah Tehsil
 is gaanv main ek brahaman parivaar rahaa karata tha jiske mukhiya the shri mata prasad mishra
 29 oktober ko mata prasad ji kii patni ne ek putr ratna ko janm diya
 At birth there was a supernatural shining on the child's face
 bachche kaa naam bhagwan shri krishna ke naam par krishna govind rakhaa gaya
 Krishna Govind was a promising stunning boy since childhood
 ek baar mata prasad ji ke ghar kuch sanyasi aae
 When he saw this stunning child, he was stunned
 unhone bhavishyavaanee kii ki ye baccha bada hokar ek mahaan sanyasi banegaa
 iske baad unhone bachche kii maan se prarthana kii ki ye baccha hame de do
 Hearing this, Krishna's mother was so scared that she took the child inside the house and went away
 unhone bachche ko dene se spasht inkaar kar diya
 When Krishna grew up, amazing things happened to him
 jab krishna bi
 e
 main padhta tha tab bhi ek baar aise hi ghatana ghati
 raat kaa samay tha
 Krishna was bedded on the ground
 sardi ke din chal rahe the or mausam bahut hi thanda tha
 Krishna was sleeping in the quilt, there was no electricity in those days
 so kamare main puri tarah se andheraa tha
 Then a snake entered her quilt
 saanp uske pair se chadh kar pet se hote hue uski gardan par ja chadhaa
 parantu uske mukh kaa tej vah sahan nahin kar sakaa
 He started going from his neck to the other side of his leg
 isi dauraan balak krishna kii neend tut gai
 He felt what is going on on his body
 usne usko uthaakar haath main le liya
 When he saw that it was a snake, he picked up the snake and threw it out the window
 balak krishna ek meghavi chaatr tha, usne apni praarambhik shiksha ambah se hi praapt kii
 But in those days there was no high school in Ambah
 so hai skool kii padhai karne ke liye unhen gwalior aana padaa
 gwalior se san 1944 main unhone hai skool kii pariksha uteern kii
 After high school, after that, his parents wanted him to get a job
 His cousin was a Sanskrit professor, once he came to Ambah, he also took Krishna with him to Ahmedabad
 krishna govind anichhaa se vahaan naukari karne chale gaye
 But luck had something else approved
 ahmedabad main unhone sirf ek raat hi kaati thi
 That night became a memorable night in his life
 jo bistar unhen sone ke liye diya gaya tha usame khatmal bhare hue the
 Bedbugs kept cutting them all night
 ab ye bhagwan kii lila hi kahi ja sakati he ki saanp jaisaa vishaiylla praani bhi jab unke tej ko sahan nahin kar paaya to tuchh khatmal ne unhen kaise kaat liya? jaise-taise unhone wo raat guzari or subah hote hi waapas ghar ke liye chal die
 He gave up the idea of doing a job
 ahmedabad se train dwaara agra hote hue wo waapas ghar pahunch gaye
 After that he thought of getting higher education
 ghar aane ke baad krishna kii shaadi kar di gai
 His wife Smt Revathi Devi was the form of Sakshat Lakshmi and Saraswati
 unhone krishna ko ucch shiksha ke liye protsaahit kiya
 Krishna came to Gwalior to pursue further studies
 gwalior main rah kar unhone ne hindi main M
A
 kii padhai puri kii
 Thereafter b
ed
 did
 ucch shiksha ki padhai ke liye paison ki aavashyaktaa thi
 But they did not have so much money to meet the expenses of studies
 apni padhai puri karne ke baad san 1951 main ve waapas ghar aa gaye
 In those days the condition of education in Ambah was very bad
 vahaan koi skool nahin tha
 Krishna pledged to start a school there
 He established a high school there
 san 1952 main is skool ke pehle batch ne hai skool kii pariksha uteern kii
 Not only was Krishna brilliant in studies, he also had a good ability to manage
 unke skool ke pratham batch ke sabhi vidhyaarthee achche nambaron se uteern hue
 The manager of this school was Mr
 Ramnivas Sharma
 sharma ji se krishna ke sambandh bahut achche the
 But luckily, something else was written
 san 1957 main vidhaan sabha ke chunaav hone the
 Ramnivas Sharma also filled the election ticket
 par raajnneeti ko lekar krishna tathaa ramanivas ke vichaar bhinn the
 Therefore, Krishna supported another candidate Shukla instead of Ramnivas
 krishna shukla ke chunaav prachaar main bhi shaamil hue
 ramanivas ko yah baat pasand nahin ai
 unhone skool ke menager kii haisiyat se krishna ko 'kaaran bataao' notice de diya
 Krishna said that voting and supporting someone is a personal matter
 tathaa skool menager kii haisiyat se ramanivas ko yah poochne kaa koi adhikaar nahin he
 Due to these differences, Krishna resigned from the school in 1958
 lekin yah acha hi hua
 This incident intensified his education campaign even more
 unhone or zyada skool khol kar zyada se zyada bacchon ko shikshit karne kaa kaam shuru kar diya, unhone jila muraina ke dharamgarh main do nae skool khole
 iske baad jila bhind main bhi do nae skool khole
 unke skulon ke sankhya babbti ja rahi the
 Krishna's schools, which specialize in management, were constantly being promoted
 unke skool ke meghavi bachche aage jaakar bade skool main daakhila le lete
 unhone pandari main bhi ek skool kholaa
 Ten years passed in this way
 krishna ke skool lagaataar tarakkee kiye ja rahe the
 The result of school was always good
 ramanivas unki tarakkee ko bahut dinon se dekh rahe the
 One day Ramnivas called him to meet him
 krishna jab unase milane gaye to ramanivas ne unase apane skool kaa pradhanadhyaapak banane kaa prastaav rakhaa
 Krishna was meant only by the education of children
 us skool kaa prabandhan un dinon acha nahin tha
 Even children were not being given good education
 so unhone prastaav sweekaar kar liya
 But he placed a condition that he would not apply
 yadi unako sarvasammati se pradhanadhyaapak niyukt kiya jayega tabhi wo yah pad sweekaar karenge
 Ramnivas and other members of the school trust accepted this
 is tarah se krishna principal ban gaye
 One day Krishna was sitting at a clothes shop in the market
 tabhi vahaan se master madhav singh badi teji se saath jate hue dikhaai die
 He asked what is the matter? Where are you running so fast? Madhav Singh told that his Guru Swami Shri Shivom Tirtha Ji Maharaj has come
 ve unase milane hi ja rahe the
 Krishna said, introduce us to them too
 ram nivas ne unhen bhi aapane saath le liya
 Both reached Guruji
 krishna ko maaloom tha kii swamiji shaktipaat parampara ke bahut hi siddh guru hai
 Upon reaching Swamiji, Krishna sat in a corner
 swamiji ek palang par baithe hue kuch pard rahe the
 People used to come there, touch Swamiji's feet
 Talked a little to Swamiji and then left
 krishna kaaphi der tak vahaan baithe rahe
 When everyone left, Swamiji started studying again
 bahut samay vyateet ho jane ke baad swamiji ne krishna ko vahaan baithe hue dekha
 unhone poocha kii aap yahan kyon baithe hue hai
 Krishna said that i too "need your favor"
 Swamiji Swamiji kept watching Krishna carefully for a while
 phir kaha ki madhav singh se baat kar lo
 ye ghatana dekhne main to saamaanya lagati he kintu is ghatana ke garbh main kya chupa tha ye kisi ko bhi nahin maaloom tha
 This normal incident changed the lives of many people
 krishna ne madhav singh ke paas jaakar kaha kii swamiji ne aap se baat karne ke liye kaha he
 Madhav Singh understood that Swamiji had asked for initiation
 madhav singh ne saare prabandh kar die
 And thus in 1973 Krishna was initiated into the Shaktipat tradition
 iske baad 15 saal tak krishna apane skool chalaate rahe tathaa saath main swamiji dwaara bataai gai riti se saadhan bhi karte rahe
 Krishna retired at the age of 63 in 1986
 unke guru swami shivom tirth ji maharaj un dinon rishikesh kii paavan bhoomi main sthit yoga shri peeth ashram main nivas karte the
 Krishna came to Rishikesh to meet him
 swamiji ne unase kaha kii tum ek kushal prabandhak ho
 i am going to Dewas for some time, so take care of the work of the ashram
 Krishna followed the order of Swamiji and started looking into the arrangement of the ashram
 thode samay ke baad krishna ko ghar kii yaad aane lagi
 He started waiting for Swamiji's arrival so that he could go home after taking orders from him
 But Swamiji did not come for two years
 do varshon ke baad san 1988 main jab swamiji waapas aae to unhone krishna ko ajna di kii ghar ke ichha tyaag kar sanyas le lo
 krishna ke liye guru kii ajna sarvopari thi
 He immediately abandoned his desire to go home and took retirement
 13 june san 1988 ko ganga dashahra ke pawan avasar par krishna ke sanyas kii prakriya puri hui
 This day was a day of great change
 hindu parampara ke anusaar sanyas ke baad naam badal jaataa he
 So, Krishna's name was changed to Swami Govindanand Tirtha Maharaj
 swami govindanand tirth maharaj ke liye ye sirf naam kaa badlaav hi nahin tha
 His thinking, activity changed everything
 ab unka adhikansh samay saadhan karne tathaa ashram sanbhaalane main vyateet hone laga
 At the time of renunciation, Swami Shivom Tirtha Ji Maharaj also gave him the power to grant mantra initiation
 san 1992 main unhen shaktipaat diksha dene kii anumati bhi maharaj ji se mil gai
 Since then, Swamiji is seated at the Yoga Sri Peeth Ashram in Rishikesh
 swamiji ne anek shishyon ko shaktipaat kii diksha dekar unke jivan ko badal diya he
 Virendra Upadhyaya has written a book - "sri Govindamratbhajan Bhagirathi"
 This book is dedicated to Swamiji
 pustak ke lekhak kehete hai ki swamiji ke aashirwad se hi unhone yah pustak puri kii he
 Phulbani is a district in the Orissa province of India
 nagpuri yaa sadri jharkhand va kuch anya rajyon main boli jane vaali ek hind-arya bhashaa he
 It is spoken by Sadani community, due to which it is also called Sadani language
 ye sadaani bolne vaale hi sadaan kehalaate hai
 The original caste of Sadans is the Naga caste
 nagajati yaa nagvansha ke shashan sthapit hone par isaki rajbhasha nagpuri, chotanagpur main sarvamaanya hui
 On being the official language of Nagpuri, in addition to the Nagas who settled in Jharkhand, this contact language of Munda, Khadia, Uraon etc
 has become the dialect of the common people
 nagpuri ke purv naam, sadaani, sadri yaa sadri, ganvaari bhi prachlit rahe hai
 Now it has got a break in the name of Nagpuri
 fadar peter shanti navrangi ne iske udbhav evam vikaas par prakaash daalate hue prashn uthaaya ki nagpuri chotanagpur kii arya bhinn boliyon ke madhya main kaise padi? kahan se ai? kab ai?3 nagpuri ke pratham vaiyaakaran rev
 i
 ech
 hvitaly ne nagpuri kaa sambandh kisi arya boli se nahin batalaaya
 On the other hand, the second capable grammar of Nagpuri Rev
 Konrad Bukout described Nagapuri as similar to Magahi, Bhojpuri, Chhattisgarhi etc
 phir bhi yah inase bhinn bhashaa he jo chotanagpur ke aranyon or pahadiyon ke bich based gaanvon main swatantratapurvak panpi or viksit hui
 Therefore, the pure form of Nagpuri is now safe in those villages
 5 fadar navrangi ne yah sweekaar kiya he ki yah kahana kathin he ki nagpuria sadaani bhashaa kis pracheen praakrit athwa madhyayug kii kisi apbhransh boli kaa vartmaan rup he
 Some forms of pronouns and verbs of this language resemble distant Rajasthani and Nepali forms, how many forms relate to ancient Vaiswari and Awadhi, how many forms correspond to the moving dialects of Bengali and Oriya
 6 Eminent scholar of Nagpuri language Prof
 Kesari Kumar has also said that like Magahi and Maithili, Nagapuri too is a definite dialect of Magadhi Apabhransh like him and belongs to Bihari
 7 dow suniti kumaar chaturjya ke anusaar magadhi prasut bhashaaon kii pracheen saamagree ke aadhaar par bhashavidon ne yah nishkarsh nikaala he ki purvavarti magadhi apbhransh ke sabhi sthaneey roopon magahi, maithili, bhojpuri, bangala, oriya or asamiya ne aathvin shatabdi se gyarahavin shatabdi tak newnaadhik maatra main swatantra rup se apni aavashyaktaaon ko puraa kar liya hoga
 It is not possible to say definitely with respect to which century this earth was completed
 yahi sthiti ham nagpuri ke liye bhi kah sakate hai
