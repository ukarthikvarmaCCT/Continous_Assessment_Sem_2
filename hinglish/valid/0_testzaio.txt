 Only one book was published in his life - Tractatus logico-philosophicus
 baad kii prakashit pustakon main Philosophical Investigations kaaphi charchit rahi
 Wittgenstein has been a professor at the University of Cambridge
 vitgenshtin ke pita karl ek yahudee the jinhone baad main protestant dharm apana liya tha
 Wittgenstein's greatest contribution is to put language in a philosophical perspective
 aaj koi bhi bhashaa vigyaan main jab darshan kaa ullekh karata he to vitganstin kaa naam swatah samaran hota he
 Wittgenstein's writings have resulted in considerable argumentation, even many times Wittgenstein's work has been called a paradox, but it would be wrong to say that logicians had emphasized logical analysis of language even before Wittgenstein
 vitganstin ke guru bartrand rasal rahe hai kaa tarkshastra ko darshan main uchit sthaan dilaane main baari yogadan he
 Wittgenstein's philosophical life is quite interesting because he has refuted his earlier works in his later works
 apni pehle kii pustakon main vitganstin satya ke liye bhashaa kaa mahatv bataate najar aate hai kintu apni antim pustak "philosophical investigations" main vitganstin ne bhashaa main vyaapt bis kaa vivaran kiya he
 Wittgenstein's conclusion proved to be new and important to the philosophical world
 vitgenstin ne ek prakaar se is vichaar kaa pratipaadan kiya ki bhashaa se satya kaa vivaran nahin balki satya kaa nirmaan kiya jaataa he
 All western philosophy is rooted in language, but language shows us only one form of truth, the truth which we create by our belief or experience
 vitgenstin baar baar ek bhashakreedaa kaa ullekh karte hai, jisamen bhaag lene vaale kisi satya kii abhivyakti ke liye bhashaa kaa nirmaan va upyog karte hai
 Through this play, we tell the difference in the facts and truths related to the Wittgenstein language

 The World Wide Web is a system of retrieving interconnected hypertext documents through the Internet
 ek web broujar kii sahaayta se ham un web pannon ko dekh sakate hai jinamein text, chhavi, video, envan anya multimedia hote hai tathaa hiserlink kii sahaayta se un pannon ke bich main avaagaman kar sakate he
 The World Wide Web was created by Tim Berners Lee in 1989 while working at the European Nuclear Research Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, and was released in 1992
 uske baad se barnars-lee nen web ke staron ke vikaas main ek sakriya bhoomika adaa kii he or haal ke varshon main unhonen cementic web viksit karne ke apane swapn kii vakaalat kii he
 Viewing a web page on the World Wide Web usually begins by typing its URL in a web browser or following a hyperlink to that page or resource
 tab us panne ko dhund kar prardashit karne ke liye web broujar andar hi andar sanchaar sandeshon kii ek shrinkhalaa aarambh karata he
 The server-named portion of the URL is first converted to an IP address with the help of a globally distributed Internet database, known as the Domain Name System
 web sarwar se sampark saadhane or data packet bhejne ke liye ye ypi pataa jaruri he
 The browser then requests the resource by sending a request for hypertext transfer protocol to that specific address of the web server
 ek aam web panne kii baat karen to, web broujar sabase pehle us panne ke ech
tii
em
el
 text ke liye anurodh karata he or tunrat hi uskaa padchhed kar detaa he
 The web browser then re-requests images and files that are part of that page
 ek website kii lokapriyata saamanyat: is baat se maapi jaati he ki kitni baar uske pannon ko dekha gaya yaa kitni baar uske sarwar ko hit kiya gaya yaa phir kitni baar uski sanchikaon ke liye anurodh kiya gaya
 After receiving the required files from the web server, the browser displays the page on the screen as instructed by HTML, cascading style sheets and other web languages
 jis web panne ko ham screen par dekhte hai uske nirmaan ke liye anya chhaviyon envan sansadhano kaa bhi istemaal hota he
 Most web pages will include hyperlinks to other pages related to them and perhaps downloadable content, source documents, definitions and other web resources
 is upyogi or sambandhit sansadhano ke samagam ko, jo kii aapas main hypertext link ke dwaara jude hue hon, ko jaankaree kaa "web" kaha gaya
 Tim Berners Lee was first named Worldwide Web in 1990 for making it available on the Internet
 web kii utpatti ke anternihit vichaaron ke lakshan 1980 main milane shuru ho gaye the jab sarn main tim barnars-lee nen ankvaiyar kii rachana kii thi, kii taraf tha jo unhonen bachapan main padhi thi
 Although it was different from the system used today, its original ideas were largely the same)
 march 1989 main tim barnars-lee nen ek prastaav likhaa jisamen ankvaiyar kaa zikr kiya gaya or ek adhik vistrut soochna pranali kaa varnan kiya gaya
 With the help of Robert Calleau, he published a more formal proposal of the World Wide Web on November 12, 1990
 iskaa adarsh namoona EBT ke DYNATEXT SGML reader, jise kii sarn dwaara anubandhit kiya gaya tha, dwaara pradaan kiya gaya tha
 EBT
 haalaanki ye DYNATEXT ke antargat SGML ISO 8879:1986 ke hypermedia main vistaar main iskaa mukhya yogadan tha) pranali kaaphi ucch takanic kii maani jaati thi, parantu ise bahut mahangaa samajha jaataa tha or HEP ke samaaj ke istemaal ke liye jo licencing niti thi use bhi anuchit samajha jaataa tha
 The Next Cube was used by berners-lee in 1990 to write the world's first web server, and the first web browser, the World Wide Web
 1990 ke christmas tak barnars-lee ne ek chaalu web ke liye aavashyak sabhi upkarnon kaa nirmaan kar liya tha:pehla web broujar, pehla web sevak or pratham web prishth jo is pariyojna kaa varnan karte the
 On 6 August 1991, he posted a brief summary of the World Wide Web project on the alt
hypertext newsgroup
 is tithi ko web ke internet par ek saarvajanik rup se uplabdh seva ke shuruyaat ke rup main bhi yaad kiya jaataa he
 The first server outside Europe was built in December 1991 at SLAC
 hypertext jaise mahatvapurn buniyadi vichaar kii utpatti 1960 kii puraani pariyojnaon se hi ho gai thi- ted nelson or andrius wain dame - ted nelson kii pariyojna zanadu or duglas engelbert kii on-line systams 
donon nelson or engelbert ko vannevar bush kii microfils par aadhaarit "memex " se prerana mili thi, jiskaa varnan 1945 ke ek niabandh main is prakaar kiya gaya tha " jaisaa ham sonchen "
 berners-lee's major success was the combination of Hypertext and Internet
 In his book Weaving the Web, he described how he repeatedly suggested to members of the two tech communities that the two technologies combine
 Maybe, but no one accepted his invitation and eventually he had to take a hand in the project
 web or anya jagahon par istemaal hone vaale sansadhano kii vishwa main ekmaatr pahchaan vaali pranali viksit kii: uniform risource abhigyapak
 The web had a lot of differences from other hypertext systems at the time
 web main do dishaao kii kadiyon kii bajaay keval ek disha vaali kadiyon kii aavashyaktaa thi
 If someone wants to join a resource, without the help of the owner of that resource, then it is also possible
 pehle kii pranaaliyon kii tulana main isane web brouzars or sarvaron ko lagu karne main aane vaali dikkaton ko kaaphi had tak kam kar diya
 But this in turn gave rise to a severe problem of link rot
 purvadhikaariyon, jaise kii hyper card, kii tulana main ye web gaiyr malikana tha
 This made it possible to develop servers and clients independently and add other extensions without license restrictions
 30 april 1993 ko sarn ne ghoshnaa kii ki vishwa vyapee web sabake liye nickshulk hoga or koi shulk bakaayaa nahin rahegaa
 With the announcement of the Gopher Protocol that its service is no longer free, the trend of people turned to the web rather than Gopher very quickly
 violawww ek shuruaati lokapriy web browsar tha, jo ki hyper card par aadhaarit tha
 Scholars generally agree that the new turning point in the life of the World Wide Web began in 1993 with the arrival of the Mosaic Web Browser, the development of this graphical browser by a team from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications of the University of Illinois at Urbana Schumpagn
 By Mark Andrissen
 mosek ke liye anudaan ucch nishpaadan computing or sanchaar pahal kii taraf se aayaa, ye ek vitt poshan kaarykram tha jisaki shuruyaat ucch nishpaadan computing or sanchaar adhinium 1991 ke tahat hui thi
 It was one of several computing development programs initiated by Senator Al Gore
 mojaik ke baahar aane se pehle chitrit or likhit shabdon kaa mishran web pannon par aam taur par nahin hota tha or isaki lokapriyata intnet ke puraane protocolon, jaise kii gobar or wide aria information sarvars, se kam thi
 Mosaic became by far the most popular Internet protocol because of its graphical user interface
 vishwa vyapee web sangh ke tim berners-lee dwaara oktober 1994 main europea sanghathan parmaanu anusandhan chhodane ke baad sthapit kiya gaya tha
 It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Laboratory of Computer Science with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency support - which started the Internet and the European Commission
 ghar main sthapit vaishvik soochna pranali kaa vichaar ko kam se kam isaac asimov kii march 1959 kii laghu kahani "aneverseri" ameging stories tak peeche khinchaa ja saktaa he
 In this, the characters obtain information through a home computer called a "multivac outlet"
 ye grah computer puure grah par faile circuits ke ek jaal dwaara ek mile lambey super computer se juda hua tha, jo kii prithvi ke andar kahin sthapit tha
 a character is thinking of establishing a multivac, junior model for his children
 is kahani main bhavishya ke us samay kii kalpana kii gai jab vyavsaayik antariksh yatra ek aam baat hogi, fir bhi mashin uttar ko ek tepe kii parchi par print karti he jo kii kisi khaane main se baahar aata he- koi video dikhaai nahin detaa he- or computer kaa maalik kahata he ki usne itnaa kharchaa isliye to nahin kiya tha kii use ek multiwa outlet mili jo sirf bolta ho
 Several formal standards and other technical characteristics define the operation of various aspects of the World Wide Web, Internet, and computer information exchange
 kai dastavejon ko vishwa vyapee web sangh ne barnars-lee ke netritv main banaaya he, lekin kuch anya ko internet ejineering task force or anya sanghathanon dwaara banaaya gaya he
 Generally, when web standards are discussed, the following publications are seen as basic: atirikt prakaashan vishwa vyapee web kii anya aavashyak takneekon kii paribhaasha pradaan karte hai, jinamein nimnlikhit shaamil hai: An important advancement in the field of web technology was the Java platform of Sun Microsystems
 isane web pannon ko chote prograamon kaha jaataa he) ko sidhe dikhne main sakasham banaaya
 These applets run on the end user's computer and provide a superior class of experience compared to web pages
 java ke graahakon ke liye jo applates the unhen anekon kaarnon se aashaa ke anuroop lokapriyata hasil nahin hui
 These reasons included the lack of integration with other elements, and the fact that many computers at that time were sent to the end customers without installing a proper Java virtual machine, which caused the user to download
 Applets used to appear
 adob flash ab un kaaryon ko karata he jinaki apeksha shuru main java applates se kii gai thi, jaise kii video saamagree, anemation, tathaa kuch utkrisht visheshtaon vaale GUI adi ko chalaanaa
swayan java kaa vyapak istemaal ab sarwar-said or anya programing ke liye uchit manch or bhashaa ke taur par hone laga he
 javascript, on the other hand, was a scripting language initially developed for use within web pages
 is manakikrut sanskaran he ECMA script 
jabaki iskaa naam java ke samaan he, javascript ko netscape dwaara viksit kiya gaya tha or java se iskaa koi lenaa dena nahin he, haalanki donon bhashaaon kii vaakya rachana ko c programing bhashaa se liya gaya he
 In combination with the Web page document object model, javascript has become a highly effective technique, even beyond its original creators' imagination
 ek panne ko uske istemaalkarta tak pahunchane ke baad bhi uske DOM main ched-chhaad karne ko gatisheel HTML kaha gaya, sthir HTML se rujhaan parivartan par jor dene ke liye aisa kiya gaya
 In normal cases, all optional information and tasks that are available on a web page with javascript are downloaded as soon as the page is first accessed
 AJAX antarmishrit web vikaas kii takneekon kaa ek samooh he jiskaa upyog interective web anuprayogon ke vikaas main kiya jaataa he jo kii web panne ke andar anshon ko unnat karne kaa ek tarika pradaan karte hai
 By using new information received at a later date by the user on the network, it helps to make the page more interactive, responsive and interesting

 Different types of information are available on the web and it has become easy for people who are interested in knowing about other societies, cultures and people

 The topography of Las Angeles is quite heterogeneous, with a total area of about 498
3 sq
 M, consisting of 469
1 sq
 m of land and 29
2 sq
 m of water
 is lihaaj se kshetrafal ke anusaar yah sanyukt rajya america kaa chaudaavaan sabase bada shahar he
 The city extends for 44 miles longitudinally and for 29 miles latitudinally
 The perimeter of the city is 342 miles
 It is the only major city in the United States bisected by a mountain range
 The highest point in Los Angeles is Mount Lukens, also called Sister Elsie Peak
 Located at the far reaches of the northeastern San Fernando Valley, it reaches a height of 5,080 ft 
 The major river is the Los Angeles River, which begins in the Canoga Park district of the city and is largely seasonal
 The river is lined in concrete for almost its entire length as it flows through the city into nearby Vernon on its way to the Pacific Ocean
 Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire
 The geologic instability produces numerous fault lines both above and below ground, which altogether causes approximately 10,000 earthquakes every year
 One of the major fault lines is the San Andreas Fault
 Located at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, it is predicted to be the source of Southern California's next big earthquake
 Major earthquakes to have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the 1971 San Fernando earthquake near Sylmar, and the 1933 Long Beach earthquake
 However, all but a few quakes are of low intensity and are not felt
 Parts of the city are also vulnerable to Pacific Ocean tsunamis; The city is situated in a Mediterranean climate or dry-summer Subtropical zone, USDA Zones 8-11, experiencing mild, somewhat wet winters and warm to hot summers
 The prevalent warm southerly airflow and the blocking effect of mountains to the north give the city a much warmer climate than would be expected
 The average annual temperature is 18
86 °C, much higher than comparable coastal locations at the same distance from the equator elsewhere such as Sydney or Cape Town
 Breezes from the Pacific Ocean tend to keep the beach communities of the Los Angeles area cooler in summer and warmer in winter than those further inland; summer temperatures can sometimes be as much as 18 °F warmer in the inland communities compared to that of the coastal communities
 a few coastal "micro-climates" have never recorded a temperature below freezing
 Coastal areas also see a phenomenon known as the "marine layer," a dense cloud cover caused by the proximity of the ocean that helps keep the temperatures cooler throughout the year
 When the marine layer becomes more common and pervades farther inland during the months of May and June, it is called May Gray or June Gloom
 Temperatures in the summer can exceed 90 ° F, but average summer daytime highs in downtown are 82 ° F, with overnight lows of 63 ° F
 Winter daytime high temperatures reach around 65 ° F, on average, with overnight lows of 48 ° f and during this season rain is common
 The warmest month is August, followed by July and then September
 This somewhat large case of seasonal lag is caused by the influence of the ocean and its latitude of 34 ° north
 The median temperature in January is 57 °F and 73 °F in August
 The highest temperature recorded within city borders was 119
0 °F in Woodland Hills on July 22, 2006; the lowest temperature recorded was 18
0 °F in 1989, in Canoga Park
 The highest temperature recorded for Downtown Los Angeles was 112
0 °F on June 26 1990, and the lowest temperature recorded was 28
0 °F on January 4 1949
 Rain occurs mainly in the winter and spring months, with great annual variations in storm severity
 Los Angeles averages 15 inches of precipitation per year
 Tornado warnings are also issued, which are extraordinarily rare downtown, though waterspouts are seen during severe storms at beaches
 Snow is extraordinarily rare in the city basin, but the mountainous slopes within city limits typically receive snow every year
 The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2
0 inches on January 15, 1932
 The Los Angeles area is rich in native plant species due in part to a diversity in habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains
 The most prevalent botanical environment is coastal sage scrub, which covers the hillsides in combustible chaparral
 Native plants include: California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Coast Live Oak, and giant wild rye grass
 Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered
 Though they are not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the tropical Coral Tree and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise, Strelitzia reginae
 Owing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles / Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog
 The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources
 Unlike other large cities that rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches of rain each year
 Pollution accumulates over multiple consecutive days
 Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act
 More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emissions vehicles
 As a result, pollution levels have dropped in recent decades
 The number of Stage 1 smog alerts has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium
 Despite improvement, the 2006 annual report of the American Lung Association ranks the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution
 In addition, the groundwater is increasingly threatened by MTBE from gas stations and perchlorate from rocket fuel
 With pollution still a significant problem, the city continues to take aggressive steps to improve air and water conditions
