 inamen shaamil hai: The WCRF panel report Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective has conclusively found evidence that alcoholic beverages increase the risk of colorectal cancer in men
 NIAAA ne report di he ki: "jaanapadik-rogavigyaan sambandhi adhyayan ne paaya he ki alcohol khapat or colorectal cancer ke bich ek chota lekin drudh khuraaq-nirbhar judaa he, yahaan tak ki jab fibre or anya aahaareey karkon kaa niyantran karne par bhi

 One study found that "people who consume more than 30 grams of alcohol per day are seen to have a slightly higher risk of colorectal cancer in such people
" " ek or adhyayan main paaya gaya ki "aadhaar rekha par pratidin ek yaa ek se adhik maadak peya kii khapat lagbhag 70% se adhik brihadantra cancer ke khatre se judi hoti he

 In our sample, people who consume more than eight doses of beer and spirit per week have been diagnosed by skinning colonoscopy to be at least one in five likely to have colorectal neoplasia
 " Other research suggests that "consuming alcohol lightly is the best way to reduce the risk of developing colorectal cancer

 Colorectal cancer is a disease arising from epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum of the gastrointestinal tract and as a result of mutations with the Wnt signaling pathway
 kuch utparivartan anuvaanshik hote hai or anya uparjit hote hai
 The most common mutated gene of all colorectal cancers is the APC gene, which produces APC protins
 β ketenin par APC protein "brake" he
 Without APC, β-catenin moves into the kidney and binds to DNA and more proteins are activated
 
 In addition to defects in the wnt-apc-beta catenin signaling pathway, other mutations are required for the cell to become cancerous
 p53 jin dwaara TP53 protein utpaadit hota he, saamaanya rup se koshika vibhaajan par nigaraanee rakhata he or yadi unamem Wnt pathave dosha hota he to koshikaon ko nasht kar detaa he
 Ultimately, a cell line acquires a mutation in the p53 gene and transforms tissue from a gland into an invasive carcinoma
 
 Another apoptotic protein is tgf-β
 kam se kam colorectal cancer ke aadhe main, tgf-β main bhi ek vikarmanyan utparivartan hota he
 
 kuch jin onkosin hote hai - ve colorectal cancer main adhik abhivyakt hote hai
 For example, RAS, RAF and PI3K that normally stimulate cells to divide in response to growth factors and with mutations that oversimplify them can be mutated
 saamanytah PTEN PI3K ko roktaa he, lekin kabhi-kabhi PTEN utparivartit ho jate hai
 It takes many years for colorectal cancer to grow and if colorectal cancer is detected at an early stage, treatment may be possible

 The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against taking aspirin in a clinical practice guideline
 The task force acknowledged that aspirin may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer, but "concluded that high doses of aspirin and the use of NSAID for the prevention of colorectal cancer suppress the benefit"
 a meta-analysis later concluded that "an uncontrolled controlled trial of 300 mg or more of aspirin daily for about 5 years with a latency of 10 years is effective in the primary prevention of colorectal cancer"
 However, taking a dose of more than 81 mg per day for a longer period of time may increase blood flow

 Following asco's recommendations, patients should now undergo KRAS gene mutation testing before being given egfr-inhibiting drugs
 In July 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration updated the label of two anti-egfr monoclonal antibody drugs (cetuximab), indicating the inclusion of information about the KRAS mutation for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer

 He ruled from 1351 to 1388
 wo, dipalpur kii hidun rajkumaari kaa putr tha
 He forced many Hindus to adopt Muslim religion during his rule

 Apart from these simple victories, there has been no major success in the name of Feroze
 usne dakshin main swatantra hue rajya vijaynagar, bahamani evam madura ko punah jeetne kaa koi prayaas nahin kiya
 Thus it can be said that Sultan Firuz Tughlaq did not undertake any military campaign during his reign for the expansion of the empire and whatever campaign he did, only to save the empire

C
 Majumdar has stated that, "firuz was the most fanatical of this era and the Sinkadar Lodi and Aurangzeb in this region was outgoing
 ’ dilli sultanate main pratham baar firoz tululaq ne brahmanon se bhi jazia liya
 In the field of education, Sultan Firoz established many tombs and madrasas
 usne 'jiyauddin barani' evam 'shams-e-siraaj afif' ko apana sangrakshan pradaan kiya
 Barani composed 'fatwa-e-jahandari' and 'date-e-firozshahi'

 He inscribed the name of his son or successor 'fatah Khan' with his name on the coins
 firoz ne apane ko caliph kaa nib pukaara tathaa sikkon par caliph kaa naam ankit karavaaya

 Bulleh Shah, also known as Bulla Shah, was a Punjabi Sufi saint and poet
 unki mrityu 1757 se 1759 ke bich vartmaan pakistan main sthit shahar qasoor main hui thi unki kavitaaon ko kaafiyaan kaha jaataa he
 He was born in 1680
 unke janmasthan ke bare main itihaaskaaron kii do raay hai
 It is believed by all that Bulleh Shah's parents were ancestrally from a village called "high Gilaniyan" in Bahawalpur state in present-day Pakistan, from where they moved to Malkwal village for some reason
 malkaval main pondoke naamak gaanv ke maalik apane gaanv kii masjid ke liye maulavee dhundte aae
 For this task he chose Bulleh Shah's father Shah Muhammad Darvesh and Bulleh Shah's parents went to Pandoke

 His Sufi guru was Inayat Shah
 bulle shah kii mrityu 1757 se 1759 ke bich qasoor main hui thi
 Many of Bulleh Shah's family members opposed him to become a disciple of Shah Inayat because Bulleh Shah's family was a descendant of Prophet Muhammad from the upper Syed Jat whereas Shah was from the Inayat Jat who were considered lower caste
 
 lekin bulle shah is virodh ke baavjood shah inayat se jude rahe or apni ek kavita main unhone kaha: Bulle nun samavavan aayi bhaiyan te bharajaiyan 'mann le bulleya sadda kaihana, chadd de palla raiyan al nabi, aulad ali, nu tu kya liqan ki?' 'jahra Sanu Iyyad Sade, Dozakon Mein Pahliyon, Any Sanu Rai Eyes, Exodus Drink Paiyen rai-sai Saini Saini Thin Rabb Bain Parwaiyan Removal Beyond Sohian Tum Bhi Lainan Jai Loden Baharan Baharan Tail of the world? Shukar ho quilts' bulle ko samajhane bahanen or bhabhiyaan ain 'hamaara kahana maan bulle, arainon kaa saath chhod de nabi ke parivaar or ali ke vanshajon ko kyon kalankit karata he?' 'jo mujhe syed bulaaegaa use dozak main sazaa milegi jo mujhe arine kahegaa use bahisht ke suhaavne jhule milenge arine or syed idhar-udhar paidaa hote rahete hai, paramatma ko zaat kii parvaah nahin vah kubsuuraton ko pare dhakelta he or badsooraton ko gale lagata he agar tu baag-bahaar chahta he, arainon kaa naukar ban ja bulle kii zaat kya poochta he? bhagwaan kii banaai duniya ke liye shukr manaa' Bulle Shah wrote poems in Punjabi called "kafian"
 kaafiyon main unhone "bulle shah" tabllus kaa prayog kiya he
 Even after hundreds of years have passed, the writings of Baba Bulleh Shah remain immortal
