 shyaam sundar das jivan ke antim kshan tak sahitya-seva main sakriy rahe
 Just before and after independence, the entire generation of Hindi grew only by sitting on Babuji's shoulders
 samay-samay par vibhinn vishyon par sammelnon main diye jane vaale unke vaktavyon kii sankhya anginat he
 Looking at all this thinking, it becomes clear how they wanted to pursue Hindi literature by connecting it with many subjects
 aaj bhi babuji kii bahut badi dein he paathya-saamagree kii pramanik rachana tathaa adhyayan ke kshetra kaa vivek
 His every minute effort to bring fresh material to the students resulted in his becoming a collector
 aalochana kii jaati he ki isi kaaran unke lekhan main gahraayi or moulikta kaa abhaav hota gaya
 But it remains to be seen that his syncretic intelligence was engrossed in the material collection of many knowledge fields
 yahan tak ki vyaavhaarik-aalochana main bhi babuji ne saamanjasywad kaa saundarya sthapit kiya
 That is why comparison, historical view, interpretation, commentary etc
 entered his criticism
 is tarah hindi main vyaavhaarik-aalochana kaa aarmabhik maarg bhi unhone taiyaar kiya
 His efficient leadership later proved to be a boon for the Hindi-speaking region
 babu shyaam sundar das ne vichaaratmak tathaa bhavatmak donon hi ek prakaar ke niabandh likhe hai
 There is enough variety in the subject of his essays
 unhone bahut se achoote vishyon par bhi lekhnee chalaai kaviyon kii khoj tathaa itihaas sambandhi nibandhon main unki pratibha ke darshan hote hai
 The language of Babu Shyam Sundar Das is pure literary Hindi, in which the corresponding words of Sanskrit are predominant
 bhashaa ke sambandh main unka vichaar tha- 'jab ham videshi bhaavon ke saath videshi shabdon ko grahan karen tab unhen aisa bana len ki unamem se videshipan nikal jaae or ve apane hokar hamaare vyakaran ke niyamon se anushaasit hon
 'therefore, wherever they have used the prevalent words of' Urdu 'in their language, they have removed their character, they have used them by removing the dots under the words pen, drill, law etc
 and changing their pronunciation
 isi prakaar sanskrit ke shabdon kii clishtataa dur kar ke unhen hindi main saral dhang se likhaa he- jaise- kaary ke sthaan par kaary, anjan ke sthaan par anjan
 Babu Shyamsunder Das was of the opinion about the word selection- 'the first place is the words of pure Hindi, behind it the easy and popular words of Sanskrit, behind it the simple and popular words of foreign languages like Persian and behind it the obsolete of Sanskrit
 Let the words be spaced
 farsi aadi videshi bhashaaon ke kathin shabdon kaa prayog kadaapi na ho
 Babu Shyam Sundar Das has written mainly in two types of styles - 1
 vichaaratmak style- vichaaratmak style main vichaaratmak niabandh likhe gaye hai
 The sentences in this style are short and expressive
 bhashaa sabal, saral or pravahamayi he
 For example- 'gopiyo kaa sneh badhaya he
 They are compiled with Krishna in Ras Leela
 anek utsav manaati he
 This behavior of Premmayi gopikas is very delightful

 Exploratory Style - The explanatory style is used in exploratory essays
 inamen vaakya apekshaakrit kuch lambey hai
 There is a plethora of corresponding words in the language
 vishay kii gahanta tathaa shushkta ke kaaran yah style main kuch shushk or rahit he
 See an example of this type of style- 'yah jivan-sangram do bhinn sabhyataaon ke sangharshan se or bhi teevr or dukhamay prathit hone laga he
 According to this condition, when literature is generated and encouraging the brain of the society, then only the signs of real progress will be seen and its welfare will give the country the glory of modern times
 babu shyaam sundardaas kii kisi prakaar kii style main alankaaron kii sajaavat nahin pai jaati
 Sayings and idioms have been used sparingly
 apane vichaaron ko bhalee prakaar samajhane ke liye babu shyaam sundar das ne ek hi baat ko 'saransh yah he' 'athwa', 'jaise' aadi shabdon ke saath baar-baar duharaaya he
 In Hindi literature, Babu Shyam Sundar Das has been replaced as his Hindi promoter and Hindi director

 Ramchandra Shukla has written in the history of Hindi literature: shyaam sundar das na keval santhaan-nirmaataa the, balki prabandh-kala main bhi bejod the
 He worked determinedly to overcome the shortages of all areas of literature
 bhashaa tatvavetta ke rup main yaa siddhanton ke vyaakhyaata rup main unheen kii uplabdhiyon ke kaaran saahityalochan hindi ke vidhyaarthiyon kaa bahut samay tak kanthhaar bana rahaa
 In his mind, the notion remained that the basis of the theoretical review of Hindi should be made by combining Sanskrit and Western criticism-principles and with a special harmony

 Did not forget the developmental side of music by giving support on behalf of

 Pt
 Bhatkhande ji himself was an educated person who had mainly 'law' education but due to his special interest in music, he studied music and detailed analysis of music with a view to make music compatible with the current situation
 Made changes and additions to some valid principles and practical experiments
 'sangeet shaastra' 'sangeet paddatiyon kaa tulanaatmak adhyayan', 'uttararabhartiya sangeet kaa itihaas', 'shri mallakshya sangitam', 'kramik pustak malika' aadi granth likhakar sangeet ko vidhyaarthiyon ke liye sulabh banane kaa praytn kiya
 Consisting of many musicians, collecting ancient captives and creating a simple lyrical system, provided protection for those restrictions
 aap hi ne raagon ko das thaton main vargeekrut karne kaa safal prayaas kiya
 Similarly, Pt
 Vishnu Digambar Paluskar traveled to different places and propagated music and established a respectful attitude towards music again in the society, which was probably lost due to the political circumstances of medieval and post-medieval period and Music was only a tool of luxury for the general public
 pan vishnu digambar ne bhi 'sangeet bal prakaash', 'sangeet bal bodh' aadi pustaken likhakar vidhyaarthiyon ke liye sangeet saamagree ko uplabdh karaayaa tathaa swatantra rup se ek swarlipi paddati kaa nirmaan karke uske madhyam se swar va lay ke sookshm vibhaajanon ko sankethik chinhon dwaara ingit karne tathaa praapt bandishon ko sangrakshan pradaan karne kaa kaary kiya
 Apart from this, many music schools were established with the efforts of these two great personalities
 18 veen shatabdi kaa ant tathaa beesvin shatabdi ke prarambh bhartiya sangeet ke punarutthan kaa kaal mana jaataa he
 At this time, the art which had been ostracized and dispensed from civilized society, became a means of luxury entertainment for the King Maharajas

 In addition to the curious learners who came to this school at a certain time, there were some students who stayed as ashram dwellers and practiced music for a long time in the Guru's sign

 For this, systematic practice and management of well-educated, cultured and skilled music teachers were made for several branches of Gandharva College established in big cities of India
 in shikshakon ko 'upadeshak' kii sangya di gai
 In 1908, a center of Gandharva College was opened in Bombay

 In order to provide social protection to music education, this school was dependent on the money of the society

 lagbhag 613 isvi ke aasapaas mohammad sahab ne logon ko apane gyaan kaa upadesha dena aarambh kiya tha
 This incident leads to the beginning of Islam
 haalaanki is samay tak isko ek nae dharm ke rup main nahin dekha gaya tha
 In later years, Islam was considered a religious sect only due to opposition from the people of Mecca and the departure of Muhammad from Medina
 agle kuch varshon main kai prabud log mohammad s0 ke anuyaayi bane
 Many people became Muslims under the influence of their followers
 iske baad mohammad sahab ne makka vaapasi kii or bina yuddh kiye makkah fatah kiya or makka ke saare virodhiyon ko maaf kar diya gaya
 After this pardon incident, all the people of Mecca converted to Islam
 par payambar ko kai virodhon or nakaaratmak paristhitiyon kaa saamana karnaa padaa par unhone har nakaaratmakataa se sakaaraatmakataa ko nichod liya jiske kaaran unhone jivan ke har kshetra main jeet hasil kii

 Hazrat Muhammad Sahab was born in 570 AD in "mecca"
 aapke parivaar kaa makka ke ek bade dharmik sthal par prabhutv tha
 Arab, Christianity, and many groups that were idolaters in the form of tribes at that time

 You started working for a widow businessman named Khadija

 In 613, you started telling people that they had received a message from God that God is one and he asked humans to walk on the path of truth and honesty
 unhone murtipuja kaa bhi virodh kiya
 But the people of Mecca did not like this thing
 mohammad sahab ko san 622 main makka chhodkar janaa padaa
 Muslims call this event a Hijra and from here the Islamic calendar Hijri begins
 agle kuch dinon main madina main unke kai anuyaayi bane tab unhone makka vaapasi kii or makka ke shaskaon ko yuddh main haraa diya
 After this many people became his followers and called their supporters as Muslims, during this time they had to fight many protests and battles
 sabase pehle to apane hi kul ke chachere bhaiyon ke saath badr kii ladaai hui - jisamen 313 logon kii sena ne kareeb 900 logon ke akraman ko parrast kiya
 After this, many parts of the Arabian Peninsula went to war with the opponents
 us samay makka tathaa madina main yahudee va kuch isai bhi rahete the
 But at that time, they were considered supporters of the unity of God, not seeing a different religion
 hazrat mohammad makkah waapas huve
 People felt that there would be a big war, but there was no war, the people lived peacefully, and Muhammad Sahab and his followers entered Makkah
 is tarah makkah bina kisi yuddh ke swadhin hogaya
 Muhammad Sahab's return to Mecca was an important event in the history of Islam, from which it later became a religion rather than being a sect
 san 632 main aapaki vafaat ho gayi
 By that time, the entire Arabian peninsula was tied to the thread of Islam

 No person was the legitimate successor of Islam

 Earlier, the Arabs had fought as fighters in the Bazantine or Persian armies, but had never become the owners of such a large empire
 isi samay kilaafat kii sanstha kaa gathan hua jo is baat kaa nirnay karata ki islam kaa uttaradhikari koun he
 Muhammad Bakr's friend Abu Bakr was declared the successor of Muhammad
 chauthe caliph ali mohammad sahab ke farik the or unhone mohammad sahab kii beti fatima se shaadi kii thi
 Despite this, at the time of his Khilafat, the Khilafat was challenged by the supporters of the third Khalifa Osman and civil war broke out in the Arab Empire
 san 961 main ali kii hatya kar di gai or osman ke ek nikat ke rishtedaar muavia ne apane aap ko khalipha ghoshit kar diya
 Umeyyad dynasty started from this time

 The Arab Empire soon took the form of the Bazantine Empire and the Sasani Empire

 Damascus was the capital

 The Arabs said that the Ummaydas have made Islam very mundane and that things at the root of Islam are becoming less common

 He felt that Ali could have been the de facto heir of Islam
 san 940 main ek abu muslim naam ke ek farsi muslim parivartit ne umayyadon ke khilaaf ek vishaal janamanas taiyaar kiya
 He revolted against the Umayyads in Khorasan
 khorasaan main pehle se hi arabon kii upasthiti ke khilaaf naaraazgi thi atah usko bade paimaane par jan samarthan mila
 He cautioned the people against the Ummidas by saying that they are not the rightful heirs of Islam and they are misusing power
 umayyadon kaa vilasita purna jivan-style ne inako or bhi bhadakaayaa
 Between 949–950, he defeated the troops sent by the Umayyads and then declared a new caliph - Abul Abbas
 abbaas, muhammd ke vansh se hi tha par ali ke alaave ek duusare bhai ke dwaara mohammad sahab se judaa tha
 But the popularity of Abu Islam was not seen by him and he hanged Abu
 isse logon main abbaas ke khilaaf rosh fail gaya
 Those who did not even trust Abbas became Shia - 92% of Iran's population today is Shia
 haalanki abbaas or uske vanshajon ne baghdad main apni rajdhani banaakar agle lagbhag 500 saalon tak raaj kiya

 Therefore, Baghdad remained the only religious headquarters and the local rulers remained militarily independent

 Even during the crusades, Baghdad failed to take any major success

 In 1258 the rapidly growing power of the Mongols defeated Baghdad and the city was looted
 lakhon log maare gaye or islamic pustakaalayon ko jala diya gaya
 The Mongols were not Muslim at the time, but they became Muslims in the next 100 years

 But Iran and its surrounding areas had a great reverence for Abu Islam and a rage against the Abbasids
 unki najar main abu islam kaa sachcha pujari tha or ali tathaa hossain islam ke sachche uttadhikari
 Those believing this belief were called Shia
 ali shiya kaa arth hota he ali kii toli vaale
 In the eyes of these people, these people took the path of truth and they were persecuted a lot by the rulers
 abu islam ko islam ke liye sahi khalipha ko khojkar bhi phaansi kii takhti ko gale lagaana padaa
