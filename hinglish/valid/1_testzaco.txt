 And slaughter God's forbidden received anything with their bad Karastaniaॅ They have been shown well and God does not bring the Kafir people to the destination, what has happened to you believers that when you are asked to get in the way of God, you are afraid and you are inclined towards the ground
 If you loved the life of the world than the world, then the life of the world is very little in comparison to the joy and comfort, if you do not leave yourself then You will get a painful surprise on you and will bring some other demos in your place and you cannot spoil anything and God is the master of everything
 If you do not help that Rasul, then he helped your Rasul at that time
 Kuffar exited at the time when there was only other Rasul when he was in both the ghars when he was explaining to his partner that don't worry, God is definitely with us, then God Area by helping them whom you people from their Tskin revealed Frmai such Lshkr them Did not even see and God showed the inferiority of the infidels and has said the same thing to God and God is a godless person, you are light or heavy when you are ordered to stand and walk with your lives immediately
 Jihad in the way of God, if you understand that it is better in your favor, if all the diarrhea was beneficial and the journey was easy, then these people would surely support you, but sorry If the power has become bloody, and if you ask the reason of being left behind, then these people will immediately eat in the form of God that if we could have been in us, then we would surely have been walking with you people
 Put it and God knows that these people are baseless liars, God has given you permission to do so, why did you allow them so that if you do not do this, then you will be exposed to those who speak the truth
 And you believe in people who Khhuda do know Juton and fast Akihrt He is not just asking for permission to jihad with his own goods and with his own life, and is allowed only by self-abstinence, then only those people who do not believe in good and daily ends and they are doing their heart, Because of the fact that if these people were determined to leave, God forbid sending them with them, then they were made to go to Kahil and they were told that you should sit Stay seated with those people, even if these people came out in you, they would have just ruined you, and your dear horses used to run around in disguise to help you and their spies are also very good for you
 Not that they had already wanted to decide and many of your things were reversed to the extent that the right has come and God himself ordered And they were exasperating, there are those hawks who clearly say that Please allow me and do not judge me that these people fall into trouble themselves and they are surrounded by the infidels of the world, they feel bad if you get any benefit and if you face any problem
 These people say that we have already done our work properly and the person returns, you say that there is no problem for us, but what God has written for you

 asi vidyut shakti par kaam kar rahe kisi udbhaar dwaara liye gayi vaastavik shakti tathaa abhaasi shakti ke anupaat ko shakti gunak yaa shakti gunank kehete hai
 The numerical value of the power coefficient is between zero and 1
 shakti gunak = p / s The average value of power taken by a load is called 'actual power'
 yahi shakti lod main ushma main badalati he, yantric kaary karti he yaa kisi anya prakaar kii urja main badalati he
 Whereas the virtual power is only a mathematical amount equal to the product of the voltage between the ends of the load and the current flowing through the load)
 shakti gunank vibhavaantar tathaa dhara ke bich ke kalaantar ke kojya ke baraabar hota he
 Power multiplier = p / s arthath shakti gunank acha hone ke liye jaruri he ki voltage or dhara ke bich main kalaantar bahut kam ho
 When the current is behind the voltage, it is called lagging power factor; When the current is ahead of the voltage, it is called 'leading power-factor'
 udyogon main induction motor evam anya prerakatv-yukt lodon ke kaaran shakti-gunank praaia: pichhadaa hua hi rahata he
 It is not considered good to take electric power at a power coefficient of less than 1 by a load and most power supply companies provide some penalty for it
 kam shakti gunank kaa sidhaa sa arth yah he ki jo kaam 'utility' se kam dhara lekar hi kiya ja saktaa uske liye adhik dhara lee ja rahi he
 Due to this greater current, the transmission line increases power loss; Transformers, circuit breakers and other things require higher ratings
 ek aur bat ye hoti hai ki cos0 ka man adhiktam hota hai When the current is not cyclic, the power multiplier is referred to in terms of the first harmonic of the fury range of the current

 ek din hidimb ne apni bahan hindiba se van main bhojan kii talash karne ke liye bheja parantu vahaan hindiba ne paanchon pandavon sahit unki mata kunti ko dekha
 This demon fell in love with Bhima on seeing this, so he did not kill them all, which Hidimb felt very bad
 phir krodhit hokar hidimb ne pandavon par hamalaa kiya, is yuddh main bhim ne ise maar daalaa or phir vahaan jangal main kunti kii ajna se hindiba evam bhim donon kaa vivaah hua
 He had a son named Ghatotkacha
 laakshagrih ke dahan ke pashchaat surang ke raste laakshagrih se nikal kar pandav apni mata ke saath van ke andar chale gayi
 Leaving Bhimsen due to many curses, the remaining people were exhausted from fatigue and lay down under a banyan tree

 When a reservoir was in view, he first drank water himself and returned to mother and brothers to feed him

 usne apni rakshasi maaya se ek apurv laavanmayi sundari kaa rup bana liya or bhimsen ke paas ja pahaunchi
 Bhimsen asked him, "O beautiful! Who are you and why are you wandering alone in this terrible forest at night?" In response to Bhima's question, Hidimba said, "O Narashrestha! i am a demon named Hidimba
 mere bhai ne mujhe aap logon ko pakad kar laane ke liye bheja he kintu meraa hriday aap par aasakt ho gaya he tathaa main aapako apane pati ke rup main praapt karnaa chaahati hoon
 My brother Hidimb is very wicked and cruel, but i have enough strength to save you from his clutches and reach a safe place
 " Seeing the delay in returning his sister here, Hidimb reached the place where Hidimba was talking to Bhimsen
 hidimba ko bhimsen ke saath premalap karte dekhakar vah krodhit ho uthaa or hidimba ko dand dene ke liye uski ore jhapata
 Seeing this, Bhima stopped him and said, "O evil demon! You do not feel ashamed to raise your hand on a woman? If you are so brave and mighty then fight me
 " itnaa kah kar bhimsen taal thonk kar uske saath mall yuddh karne lage
 Kunti and other Pandavas also got sleep
 vahaan par bhim ko ek rakshas ke saath yuddh karte tathaa ek rupavati kanya ko khadi dekh kar kunti ne poocha, "putree! tum koun ho?" hidimba ne sari baaten unhen bataa di
 Arjuna lifted his bow to kill Hidimba, but Bhima refused to release the arrow, "anuj! Don't leave the arrow, it is my prey and will die at my own hands
" " itnaa kah kar bhim ne hidimb ko donon haathon se pakad kar uthaa liya or use hawa main anek baar ghuma kar itani tivrata ke saath bhoomi par pataka ki uske praan-pakheru ud gayi
 When Hidimba died, they began preparing for departure from there, upon which Hidimba fell at Kunti's feet and prayed, "O mother! i have accepted your son Bhima as her husband
 aap log mujhe krupa karke sweekaar kar lijiye
 If you do not accept me, then i will give up my life at this moment
 " hidimba ke hriday main bhim ke prati prabal prem kii bhaavana dekh kar yudhisthir bole, "hidimbe! main tumhen apane bhai ko saunpta hoon kintu yah keval din main tumhaare saath rahaa karegaa or raatri ko ham logon ke saath rahaa karegaa

 Hidimba took his son to the Pandavas and said, "this is your brother's son, so he will be in service of you
" " itnaa kah kar hidimba vahaan se chali gai
 Ghatotkacha bowed with reverence at the feet of the Pandavas and Mother Kunti and said, "now tell me my worthy service
 ? uski baat sun kar kunti boli, "tu mere vansh kaa sabase bada pautra he
 Your service will definitely be taken when the time comes
 " is par ghatotkach ne kaha, "aap log jab bhi mujhe samaran karenge, main aap logon kii seva main upasthit ho jaaungaa

 sampidit vaayu kaa upyog do prakaar se ho saktaa he : mashiinon main sampeedit vaayu taiyaar kar, kaamon main aisi vaayu sidhe lagaai ja sakati he, athwa sampidit vaayu silinderon main bharkar sanchit rakhi ja sakati he or aavashyaktaanusaar use bhinn-bhinn kaamon main lagaaya ja saktaa he
 Compressed air receiving machines are called air compressors
 vaayu ko sampidit karne kaa sabase saral upkaran bisikil yaa motorcar ke tubon main hawa bharne kaa vaayu pump he
 However, high pressure compressed air cannot be obtained from the air pump
 adhik dabaav ke liye zatil vaayu sampidak bane hai
 Initially, they were used to make tunnels by cutting mountains with compressed air-driven drills
 peeche rail ke brikon main bhi inkaa upyog shu degree hua
 Normal air compressors produce 60 to 100 pounds of pressurized air per square inch
 aise bhi sampidak bane hai jinase hajaaron pound dabaav kii vaayu praapt ho sakati he
 The compressor has a piston inside the cylinder
 silinder ke ek chor par do valve, ek bheetar kii ore khulanevaala or doosraa baahar kii ore khulanevaala hota he
 When the piston of the cylinder is pulled to the top end, the air pressure inside the cylinder decreases and the air from the atmosphere is pulled by this valve
 jab piston ko neeche kiya jaataa he, tab dabaav ke bad jane ke kaaran andar khulanevaala valve band ho jaataa he or baahar se khulanevaala valve khul jaataa he, jisase silinder kii vaayu nikalakar "vayukaksh" main chali jaati he
 By repeating this process several times, the air pressure of the leukocyte gradually increases
 upyukt dabaav kii vaayu ko nal dwaara nikaalkar kaam main laayaa ja saktaa he
 Air compressors can be divided into three categories: pratyaagmani vayusampidak adhik upyog main aate hai
 Their principle is the same as described above
 vaayu pump dwaara hi cycle or motor gadiyon ke tub main hawa bhari jaati he
 Tunnels can be made by drilling holes in the mountains with compressed air driven drills obtained from air compressors
 vaayu sampidak dwaara hi theatre, cinemagharon, badi badi imaaraton or khaanon main sanvathan kiya jaataa he, jisase ashuddh vaayu nikalakar uskaa sthaan shuddh vaayu le leti he
 Milling can also be done with this help
 sampidit vaayu se bade hathode chalaakar koyala, pathar, baaluu, kancreet aadi tode or pise jate hai
 Compressed air obtained from the air compressor can be riveted and iron and steel can be peeled
 sampidit vaayu kii sahaayta se bade bade jahaajon, vayuyanon, motorkaron aadi par polish ko ja sakati he or varnish chadhaai ja sakati he
 Cleaning of houses, whitewash of walls and varnish on rangis and furniture is done at a lesser cost with the help of compressed air from air compressors
 anek saamaanon kii safai tathaa makaanon kii buharai bhi isaki sahaayta se hoti he
 Rail brakes work with compressed air force
 sampidit vaayu kii sahaayta se anek saamaanon, jaise anaaj, koyale aadi, ko ek sthaan se duusare sthaan tak bheja ja saktaa he
 The list of uses of compressed air is quite long

 jab ki purvakaal main yah samudaay shiv va shakt kaa upaask tha
 Kachi is part of a larger community that claims to have a coordinated origin
 yah samudaay kushavaah naam se janaa jaataa he
 Nowadays these communities claim themselves as descendants of Kush, son of Lord Rama, the incarnation of Vishnu and descended from Suryavansh, but this claim is based on a legend only
 isse purv kushavaah samudaay ki jatiyaan- maury, kaachhi va koiri swayan ko shiv va shakt sampradaay se judaa hua bataate rahe hai
