 Two Rajya Sabha seats have become vacant due to the death of Madan Lal Saini in Rajasthan and the resignation of Neeraj Shekhar in Uttar Pradesh

 He was a Rajya Sabha MP from the Samajwadi Party
 niraj shekhar ne sirf rajyasabha kii sadsyta hi nahin chodi balki samaajawaadee party se bhi istipha de diya
 a few days later Neeraj Shekhar joined the BJP
 niraj shekhar kaa rajyasabha kaarykaal november 2020 tak tha
 Similarly, Rajan Sabha MP from Rajasthan and former BJP state president Madanlal Saini died on 24 June 2019

 According to the Meteorological Department, heavy rainfall ranging from 20 to 31 cm has been recorded at many places in Meghalaya

 The monsoon rains continued to rain amid heavy cloud movement at many places in Assam and northern Bihar as well as eastern Uttar Pradesh
 mausam vibhagaka kahana he ki hawaaon kii dasha-disha main badlaav dekha ja rahaa he
 But despite all this, there is a possibility of heavy rains in all areas of North Bihar

 In all the states of Northeast India, the direct winds coming from the Bay of Bengal have set up clouds
 in jagahon par agle do-teen dinon tak logon ko saavdhaan rahane kii jarurat he
 Actually, the axis of monsoon is currently passing through Meghalaya via Amritsar, Karnal, Sultanpur, Bhagalpur, Dhubri
 is vajah se himalay kii talahati ke saath-saath purvottar bharat ke tamaam ilaakon main musaladhar barish kaa silsilaa bana hua he
 On August 19, heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected in the Himalayan regions of West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya
 20 agast kii baat karen to pashchimi bengal ke himalay kii talahati vaale ilaakon, sikkim, assam, meghalaya or bihar main kai jagahon par ativrishti kii sambhaavna he
 When the monsoon axis moves from south to north direction, the probability of monsoon rains starts increasing in all areas of the Himalayas
 lihaaja himalay main rahane vaale logon ko bhi baari barish se satark rahane kii jarurat he
 Some consider her the biggest hope of the Congress in the fight for survival, although she herself has been an arm's length away from politics
 baat priyanka gandhi kii ho rahi he jo kayaason or anischitata ke baad aaj aakhirkaar party ke garh raibareli main prachaar ke liye utrengi
 However, the lump of alliance with Samajwadi Party is so entangled in the region that Priyanka herself will be confused as to whom she should vote for
 lekin jo unhen jaanate hai wo ye zarur kahenge ki janata ke saamne kise nishane par lenaa he, ye unke jehan main saaf hoga
 Will Smriti Irani get the answer? Priyanka Gandhi's amethi-rae Bareli tour was targeted by Union Minister Smriti Irani for the pasopesh kanpur main chunavi raily ke dauraan kendriya mantri smriti irani kaa kahana tha ki priyanka logon ke sawaalon se bachanaa chaahati hai
 Hopefully, Priyanka will respond to Irani's statement today
 donon netaaon ke bich jubaani jang pehle bhi hoti rahi he
 Priyanka Gandhi attacked Irani for not having an IIT campus in Amethi
 is par irani ne unhen yaad dilaayaa tha ki amethi main iiiti elahabaad kaa ek aaf campus he
 Will comment on Katiyar? Last month, BJP fast-paced leader Vinay Katiyar took a dig that Priyanka is more beautiful campaigner than Priyanka Gandhi in her party
 priyanka ne palatwaar karne main der nahin lagaai thi
 He said that this statement shows the thinking of BJP
 ho saktaa he ki aaj votaron kii hamadardi ke liye priyanka ek baar phir is bayaan kaa zikr karen
 Priyanka Gandhi will speak on PM Modi? In 2014 general election, Priyanka Gandhi gave a befitting reply to the words spoken by Narendra Modi
 modi ne 56 inch kaa seenaa thoka to priyanka ne unhen bade seene ke bajaae bada din rakhane kii naseehat di
 If Modi targeted Rajiv Gandhi, Priyanka called her father a martyr in front of the people of Amethi, like a political politician
 haal main piem modi ne purv pradhanmantri manmohan singh ke khilaaf tippanee kii thi
 It remains to be seen whether Priyanka will challenge Modi directly in her stronghold this time too
 She will comment on these BJP leaders as well
 Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Thursday called the Congress a benami property that has no owner
 unka ishaara party main rahul, sonia or priyanka gandhi ke role ko lekar tha
 Like him, an army of lower level leaders in BJP has been attacking Priyanka Gandhi
 pradesh mahaamantri vidyasagar sonkar ne unhen 'puraani file' bataaya tha to kendriya mantri mahendranath pandey priyanka gandhi kii tulana 'fansy bartan' se kar chuke hai

 In 1976, an eccentric boy named Edmund Thomas Clint was born in Kochi, Kerala
 1983 main kidney fail hone ke kaaran uski maut sirf 7 saal kii maasoom umr main ho gai thi
 But you will be surprised to see what he did in these seven years
 ji haa us bachche ne itani kam umr main apni maut se pehle 25 hajaar painting bana daaleen
 Generally, years of analytical study and training are required to make such paintings
 clint ne sirf 2 saal kii umr main hi painting kerani shuru kar di thi or apni maut se pehle kuch behtareen paintings banaain
 There are also documents that when Clint was just five years old, he took first place in a painting competition
 aapako yah jaankaar hairaani hogi ki clint ne jis pratiyogita main pehla sthaan hasil kiya tha us pratiyogita main 18 saal kii umr tak ke logon ne bhaag liya tha, lekin clint ne sabko pachhad diya
 Now you can imagine how big a painter he would have been if Clint were alive today

 The land has been lost, the terrorists have not survived, the life is in trouble and now Operation Okra has been launched against Baghdadi from above
 yani bachi-khuchi jo ummiden thim ab wo bhi tuutakar bikhar gayi
 But what is this operation okra? And what does this opera okra have to do with Baghdadi? So know, when the sky rains doom, destruction comes from the sea and death from the ground
 to bas use hi 'opershan okara' kehete hai
 After the apocalypse which rained on Baghdadi's head, after that, Baghdadi must have been thinking what to do if he does now
 fiter jetts ne bagdadi ke thikaanon ko tabah kiyaek ke baad ek uske aatanki marate ja rahe hai
 Iraqi and Syrian forces are seizing their lands, and the weapons they had to support were destroyed and destroyed by these warships in Australia
 bagdadi kii sultanate main ek arase ke baad aisa zordaar hamalaa hua he
 This attack was also one which broke the back of Baghdadi and now Baghdadi is not even able to show her face in the battlefield
 syria, iraq, rus or america ke baad ab australia ke hamalon ne use kahin kaa nahin choda he
 From the warship f / A-18 Hornet Fighter, the Australian Defense Force launched such swift attacks in Iraq and Syria that even the last hope of Baghdadi was lost
 baari bharkam bamon se las f / A-18 hornett fiteron ko nazadiiki airbase se udaaya gaya
 With full enthusiasm, the pilots of the Australian Air Task Group flew in the sky
 ek saath darjanon kii taadaad main fiter jetts ne bagdadi ke thikaanon ko tabah karne ke liye udaan bhari
 The Australian Defense Force is armed with many advisories to destroy IS in air to air and land to air
 or ek barbagadadi kii sultanatepar pahunchane ke baad jaise hi inhen control room se ishaara mila, vaise hi fiter jet main baithe payalton ne ek saath trigar dabaa diya
 As soon as the trigger was pressed, bombs in the fighter jet attacked ISIS targets
 sabase pehle hamalaa kiya gaya uttari iraq ke un ilaakon par jahaan aatanki bam bana rahe the
 Baghdadi terrorists opened a bomb making factory here
 or jaise hi bam ne in jagahon par tabaahi machaai uskaa dhuaan or dhamaake kii awaz kai kilometre dur tak suni gai
 During this time a strange picture was also recorded in the camera
 bam girane or dhamaake hone ke baad bhi missile jaisi kisi chiz ke nikalne kii tasviren record huin
 After destroying ISIS terrorist bases in Iraq, the Australian Defense Force moved to Syria and dropped bombs there
 hawa main puraa kiya tel bharne kaa kambum giraane kaa silsilaa tab tak jari rahaa jab tak oparation okara puraa nahin hua
 This name was given to this operation which destroyed the Baghdadi arms factory
 oparation ke dauraan ek vakt wo bhi aayaa jab kai australian fiter jet kaa tel khatm hone laga
 But instead of going back to the airbase without completing the mission, the pilots completed the filling of oil in the air
 trump ke america raashtrapati banane ke baad se hi iraq or syria main australian military ke air task group kii hawaii gatividhiyaan kaaphi bad gai hai
 Australia's Defense Department itself has confirmed that it has fielded about 780 Australian Defense Forces
 inamen se kareeb 300 australia ke air task group ke hai
 While 80 Special Operations Task Group commandos and 300 Task Groups are fresh
 mana ja rahaa he ki australian force ke is hamale main na sirf iesas ke hathiyaaron kaa zakhira puri tarah barbaad ho gaya he balki uske kai aatanki bhi maare gaye hai
 The figure of the slain militants has not been released, however, no agency has released the figure of the slain terrorists yet
 khayr, oparation okara to aapane samaj liya magar shaayad us baat par gaur nahin kiya, jo baat bagdadi ke dar kaa sabab bani hui he
 And that is the fact that the Australian Defense Force is sending 80 of its special commandos to Iraq and Syria for the elimination of terror
 ye vahi commando hai, jo goli pehle maarthe hai or sunate baad main hai
 They do not have any scope for both these things
 80-80 aatankiyon par baari hai australian dephence force kaa ek-ek special commando
 So imagine the fate of the terrorists who have decided to send 80 special commandos to the Australian army to fight terror in Iraq and Syria
 jal main, thal main or aasmaan main inkaa koi sani nahin he
 The aim is to treat the scope of the mistake as negligible
 mustaidi aisi ki aatanki bachakar nikal jaae aisa mumkin nahin
 There is no need to prepare a blueprint for the elimination of IS terrorists that if they get down in the battlefield, then the terrorists will not do well
 iraq or syria main aatankiyon kii luka-chhipi kaa khel ab khatm hi samajhie
 Because Australia has decided that 80-80 special commandos, not one or two of its defense force, are going to land on Iraq and Syrian territory to eliminate the terrorists
 jo bagdadi ke gurgon ko unke bilon main ghuskar maarenge
 The blueprint for this most dangerous plan to eradicate terror has been prepared so far
 kab, kahaan or kaise
 How will the operation of these canker of humanity be sent to the world, now the world will see it very soon
 darasal, ye duniya ke wo sabase khatarnaak commando hai, jo dushman ko pataal se bhi ghaseet laate hai
 Because these are the commandos of Australia, whose operation is never unsuccessful
 or ab yahi force bagdadi ke aatankiyon par kaal banakar tuutane vaali he
 These commandos are launched to win quickly, for your information, tell them that they are fielded only when victory is needed as soon as possible
 or ab ye tay ho chukaa he ki australia ke ye special commando iesas ke khatme kii kasam khaakar bahut jald maidan-e-jang main utarane vaale hai
 And once they reach, then it will not take much time to break the fortifications of the terrorists
 ye aatank kii har goli kaa munhtod jawaab denge
 Jihad will happen when terrorists survive and it seems that the story of ISIS terrorists is just over
 kahani to khayr bagdadi kii bhi ab zyaada bachi nahin he
 That is why when the life began to fester, this man of terror himself told his terrorists, run away from life and if you are afraid of being caught, then blow yourself away
 syria or iraqmen aatank ke is aakaa par itane hamale ho rahe hai ki ab uski himmat jawaab dene lagi he
 The terrorists have started tearing the ground of the terrorists
 jin ilaakon main abu-bakar-al-bagdadi or uske aatanki sanghathan islamic state ke aatankiyon ne tabaahi machaa rakhi thi, ab vahaan bhi unhen sir chupaane kii jagah nahin mil rahi he
 And now they are dead
 america, rus, syria or iraq samet mitra deshon kii senaaon ne use chaaron taraf se gher rakhaa he
 Since the change of rule in America, the attacks of allied forces have also intensified
 in hamalon kii vajah se aatank ke samrajya kaa puri tarah se safaaye kaa vaqt ab behad nazadik he
 Because his henchmen, who he had the most confidence in, are slowly getting eliminated
 ab to alam ye he ki aatankiyon ko chhodie khud bagdadi ko apni jaan kii phikr sataane lagi he
 In order to save his life, he has been living again and again
 shaayad use bhi ab ye ehsaas ho chukaa he ki maut use kabhi bhi apane panje main gher sakati he
 And its end is fixed
 aatankiyon se kaha- laut jaao apane deshisiilie usne faisla kiya he ki apni sultanate main pal rahe aatankiyon ko wo apni panaah se azaad kar degaa
 Very close to Baghdadi has revealed that he has told his terrorists that defeat is certain
 lihaaza jaan bachaa sakate ho to bachaa lo
 Those who want to return to their respective countries should return and those who are unable to return and fear of getting caught, blow themselves away
 bagdadi kii sultanate se hua ye khulaasa bataa rahaa he ki duniya kaa sabase bada aatanki ab kitna bebas ho chukaa he
 That is why he is advising his terrorists to move from Iraq and Syria to other countries to make a hideout and fulfill the mission of ISIS
 or agar aisa hua to yakeen maniye iraq or syria main khatme ke baad bhi bagdadi ke gurgey puri duniya main maujuud rahenge

 himalay ghoomane janaa ho to is samay kaa mausam sabase behtareen mausam he
 At the moment that if we talk then the second fortnight of October is there and the weather is clear in most of the Himalayas
 yani din main khili hui dhoop or raat main taron bharaa aasmaan
 According to the Meteorological Department, the monsoon has returned from a large part of the country at this time and no powerful Western Disturbance is going to come in the Himalayas at the moment
 is vajah se agle 15 dinon tak uttar pashchim himalay ke tamaam ilaakon main mausam suhaavna bana rahegaa
 In such a situation, this weather is favorable for those who are fond of walking in mountainous areas
 mausam vibhaag ke taaja aankadon ke mutabik is samay monsoon ne purvottar bharat ke sabhi ilaakon purvottar bengal kii khadi ke puure hisson, andhra pradesh ke zyaadaatar ilaakon, roilseema, karnataka or madhya arab sagar ke ek bade hisse se vaapasi kar lee he
 At this time, the return line of monsoon is passing through Tirupati, Bengaluru, Mangaluru

 mausam vibhaag kaa kahana he kii yah sthiti aane vaale 7 dinon tak barkaraar rahegi, yani din main khili hui dhoop se zyaadaatar ilaakon main taapmaana saamaanya se upar bane rahenge
 But the special thing is that the winds on the ground are slightly strong at this time, due to which people are not feeling much heat
 dekhen himalay kii oonchi-oonchi chotiyanmausam vibhaag kaa kahana he yah samay monsoon ke baad kaa samay he
 Due to this, there is no dry weather in all the regions of the Himalayas
 saath hi saath tamaam pahari ilaakon main hariyaali bharpoor he
 Due to this, the weather remains pleasant at most of the hill stations and due to the lack of rain, landslide-like situation is not going to arise anywhere
 aise main nainital, manali, almoda, kausani, shimla, patnitop jaise hill steshnon par janaa is samay kaaphi aaramdaayak ho saktaa he
 The special thing is that due to the clear weather at this time, the high peaks of the Himalayas can be seen clearly

 dilli kii kejariwal sarkaar ne 'health for aal' ke tahat free surgery yojana ko lagu kar diya he
 The scheme has been launched in all private hospitals in the capital Delhi
 ise lekar bijepi ne kejariwal sarkaar par tanj ksaa
 BJP President Manoj Tiwari said that such alternative health services are just a gimmick to divert public attention from the corruption cases coming up in front of his government
 manoj tiwarine kaha ki ye vahi log hai jo sarkaar banane se pehle dilli ke saare sarkari aspataalon ko ames jaisaa banane kaa daawa karte the lekin kuch bhi na kar paae
 The government said that free surgery scheme has also been started in private hospitals
 aise main manoj tiwari poochhate hai ki sarkaar ne jin aspataalon or jaanch kendron ko suchi baddh kiya he kya unase koi baatcheet or samjhauta kiya gaya he
 They ask if commercial rates are charged for surgery in private hospitals
 kisi bhi sarkaar ke liye un daron par bhugtan karnaa vyavhaarik nahin ho saktaa aise main sarkaar bataae ki vah kis tarah logon kaa ilaaj karavaaegi
 Manoj Tiwari asks the government to tell the public if they will be sent for operation in private hospitals, then the remaining treatment will be in the government hospital that will be in a private hospital? Similarly, the responsibility of maintenance after the operation will be with the private hospital or the government hospital and if there is any health loss with the patient sent to a private hospital by the government hospital, then whose responsibility will it be? Manoj Tiwari raised the question In its election manifesto by Man Party, 900 new primary health centers, 30,000 new beds in government hospitals including 4,000 The level was to be for the mother and child and what happened to the promise of five beds of international standard for every 1,000 people? He says that like other works of the Kejriwal government administration, the faith of the people of Delhi also in the matter of health services She is completely lost
 nijee aspataalon ke naam kaa chhalaava bhi mohalla clinics, swine flu clinics, dengue clinics or muft dawaaon jaisaa hi he
