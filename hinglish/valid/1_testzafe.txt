 'Z' ko do siton vaale vaahan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 In the 'M' version of 'Z' models, 'M' is added as a suffix or prefix, depending on which country it is to be sold
 
 In previous x and z vehicles, the engine displacement number is followed by 'i' or 'si'
 BMW is now setting standards for globally defined terminologies for its x and z vehicles, followed by two numbers followed by 'sdrive' or 'xdrive', which represents the engine of the vehicles

 jal pradooshan, in jal nikaayon ke padpon or jeevon ko prabhavit karata he or sarvada yah prabhaav na sirf in jeevon yaa padpon ke liye apitu sampurna jaivik tantra ke liye vinaashkari hota he
 The main cause of water pollution is the pollutants born as a result of human or animal biological or industrial activities, to be directly immersed in the water streams without proper treatment
 jal pradooshan ek pramukh vaishvik samasya he
 Changes in Cost estimation and water Conservation policy carried out at all levels is needed
 kyonki jal pradooshan ke kaaran puure vishwa main kai prakaar kii bimaariyaan or logon kii maut bhi ho rahi he
 Due to this, about 14,000 people are dying every day
 jisamen 580 log bharat ke hai
 In China, 90 percent of the cities water is polluted
 varsh 2007 main ek jaankaree ke anusaar china main 50 lakh se adhik log surakshit peya jal kii pahunch se dur hai
 This problem occurs in most developed countries
 udhaaharan ke liye america main 45 pratishat dhara main behate jal, 47 pratishat jhil, 32 pratishat khadi ke jal ke prati varg mile ko pradooshit jal ke shrenee main liya gaya he
 According to a 2007 statement by the National Development Department in China, seven rivers of China contain poisonous water, causing skin damage
 varsha ke jal main hawa main upasthit gaison or dhul ke karnon ke mil jane aadi se uskaa jal jahaan bhi jamaa hota he, vah jal bhi pradooshit ho jaataa he
 Apart from this, volcanoes etc
 are also some of the reasons for this
 yah kai rogon ke janak hote hai
 For this reason, they are called pathogenic
 isamen vishaanu, jeevanu, kavak, paraseete aadi aate hai
 These occur mainly when water is collected in one place
 iske alaava yah sade gale khaadya padaarthon main bhi paidaa ho jate hai
 In this, all types of organic, inorganic substances which should not be in the rivers, fall in this category
 kapade yaa bartan kii dhulaai yaa jeevon yaa manushyon ke sabun se nahaane par usase sabun pani aadi jal main vilay ho jaataa he
 Food or any other particle can pollute water
 petrol aadi padaarthon kaa risaav samudri jal pradooshan kaa bada kaaran he
 Petrol is imported and exported by sea routes
 in jahaajon main se kai baar risaav ho jaataa he yaa kisi kaaran se jahaaj durghatana kaa shikaar ho jaataa he
 Water pollution is caused by its sinking etc
 or by oil spills in the sea
 kai bade kaarkaane vastu aadi ko galane hetu bahut garm karte hai
 Along with this, there are many such substances in it, which cannot be used in the factory
 use kahin ore daalane ke sthaan par yah use nadi main daal dete hai
 Due to which river water gets polluted
 iske ooshmaa ke kaaran kai jaleey jeevon jaise machhlee aadi kii bhi maut ho jaati he, jo nadiyon main kachra khaakar use saaf rakhane kaa bhi kaary karti hai
 Oxygen does not dissolve in hot water and due to this many aquatic organisms are destroyed
 tapiya yaa ooshmiya pradooshan nadiyon aadi main bahut hi thande jal pravaahit karne par bhi hota he
 The greatest danger is on the rivers that remain warm
 jal pradooshan ko mapa bhi ja saktaa he
 Several methods are available for its measurement
 jal ke kuch namoonay lekar rasinic prakriya dwaara yah gyaat kiya ja saktaa he ki usamen kitni ashuddhta he
 Several published methods are available for both organic and inorganic compounds
 isamen mukhyatah ph, or jeevon dwaara oxigen kii aavashyaktaa aadi he
 In biological testing, plants, animals and animals are used
 isamen inke swasthya or badhane kii gati aadi ko dekh kar unke rahane ke sthaan or paryaavaran kii jaankaree milti he
 Drains should be cleaned regularly to control water pollution
 gramin ilaakon main jal nikaas hetu pakke naaliyon kii vyavastha nahin hoti he
 Due to this, its water goes anywhere in a chaotic manner and reaches a source like a river canal etc
 is kaaran naaliyon ko thik se bananaa or use jal ke kisi bhi strot se dur rakhane aadi kaa kaary bhi karnaa chahie
 Many industries put the remaining material after manufacture of the commodity which does not come in any work, to the river etc
 kai baar aas paas ke ilaakon main bhi daalane par varsha ke jal ke saath yah nadi yaa anya jal ke sroton tak pahunch jaataa he
 All the remaining materials should be destroyed properly by industries to prevent this pollution
 kuch udyog safaltaapurvak is niyam kaa paalan karte hai or sabhi shesh bache padaarthon kaa yaa to punah upyog karte hai yaa use surakshit rup se nasht kar dete hai
 In addition to reducing substances such changes are made in its manufacturing method

 lagbhag 13 veen sadi ke baad se bhartiya upmahadweep ke uttari bhaag main “sant mat” ek deele dhang se judaa guruon kaa ek sahyogi samooh tha jise bahut prasiddhi mili
 His teachings as a religion theology are characterized by a divine doctrine of introvert and love devotion and socially he is associated with an egalitarian doctrine which is against the caste system of Hinduism and Hinduism
 It is also against the difference of Muslim
 sant parampara ko mukhyat: do samoohon main baanta ja saktaa he: punjab, kshetra ke santon kaa uttari samooh jisane apni abhivyakti mukhyat: bolchaal vaali hindi main kii or dakshini samooh jisaki bhashaa puraatan marathi he or jiskaa pratinidhitiv namdev or maharashtra ke anya sant karte hai
 'sant Mat' means 'the path of saints', 'the path of truth', 'the path of right and optimism' or 'opinion of saints'
 The word 'saint' is derived from the Sanskrit metal 'sad' and is used in many ways
 Its original meaning is' one who knows the truth 'or' one who has experienced the ultimate truth
 ' 'sant' shabd se arth aam taur par ek achche vyakti se liya jaataa he lekin iskaa vishesh arth madhyakaalin bharat ke sant kaviyon se hi liya jaataa he
 The Sant Mat movement was not uniform and involved its own socio-religious behavior of saints which was based on the devotion described in the Bhagavad Gita a thousand years ago
 unki apni sajhi kuch roodhiyaan aapas main or un paramparaon ke anuyaayion main bhi sajhi thim jinhen unhone chunauti di thi
 Thus, the saint opinion seems to be such a diverse group of spiritual personalities rather than a specific religious tradition that accepts a common spiritual origin
 is andolan kii seemayen sambhavat: sampradaiwaadee nahin thim or isamen jati or puja-paddati kii brahman avadharanaayen bhi nahin thim
 The saint poets wrote their speech in spoken language which they addressed to the common people in local languages like Hindi and Marathi
 unhone ishwar naam ko sachcha rakshak kaha or dharmik aadambaron ko moolyaheen kah kar khaarij kar diya
 He established the idea that religion is a matter of devotion to God that dwells in the heart
 "
 The first generation of North Indian sages including Kabir and Ravidas were born in Benares in the middle of the 15th century
 Before him, the two main personalities were Namdev and Ramananda in the 13th and 14th centuries
 According to the Sant Mat tradition, Ramananda was a Vaishnava monk who donated names to Kabir, Ravidas and other saints
 ramanandi bhikshuon kii parampara, uske baad ke anya sant or baad ke sikhon dwaara ramanand kii katha ko alag-alag tarah se bataata he
 There is so much information that Ramanand accepted disciples from all castes, a fact which was opposed by orthodox Hindus at that time
 sant mat ke anuyaayi maanate hai ki ramanand ke shishyon ne santon kii pehali peedi taiyaar kii
 These saints developed a culture that was close to the marginalized human beings in the society, which included women, Dalits, untouchables and the extreme
 kuch adhik prasiddh santon main namdev, kabir, nanak, surdaas, mira bai, tulsidas or tukaraam shaamil hai
 
 santon kii panrapara gaiyr-sampradaiwaadee rahi yadhyapi mana jaataa he ki kai sant kaviyon ne apane sampradaay sthapit kiye
 Many of these have saints associated with their names, but their disciples later carried on cults like Kabir Panth, Dadu Panth, Dariya Panth, Advaita Matha, Science of Spirituality and Radhaswamy
 dharmik hinduon ke ek alp samudaay ne hi aupchaarik rup se sant mat kaa anugaman kiya he
 But this tradition has a great impact on all sects and castes
 mira bai jaise beete santon ke bhajan ko bharat or vishwa bhar main hindu jatiyon main kaaphi suna jaataa he
 Medieval and modern Bharata is the only saintly tradition that has successfully broken Hindu and Muslim boundaries
 julius je
 lipnor ne jor de kar kaha he ki santon kii dharmik shikshaaon ne kai hinduon ke jivan kaa utthan kiya he or usne use swatantraadaayini kaha he
 In the Sant Mat tradition, importance is given to the living Guru, which is addressed with respectful words like Satguru or 'purna Guru'
 mana jaataa he ki madhyakaalin sufi kaviyon yatha jalaal al-deen mohammad rumi or sindhi kaviyon or sant mat kaviyon ke bich bahut samanta he
 The Radhaswami movement of North India considers itself to be the main endowment of saintly tradition and religious endeavor and presents itself as a living embodiment of the saintly tradition
 sabase adhik ullekhneey radhaswami satsang beas he, jo beas nadi ke kinare par sthit he or jiske vartmaan jivit guru gurinder singh hai
 According to Mark Jürgansmeyer, such a claim is also made by Kabir Panthi, Sikhs and other movements who are gaining insights from today's legitimate Sant Mat tradition

 The pattern of species distribution in geographic areas can usually be explained through a combination of historical factors such as: globalization, extinction, continental drift, and glaciation By looking at the geographic distribution of species, we can see sea levels, river routes, You can see related variations in habitat, and river occupation

 iskaa prakaashan 15 agast 1867 ko varanasi armbh hua jo ek krantikari ghatana thi
 It was a poetry-centric letter
 is patr ne hindi sahitya or hindi patrakarita ko naye aayam pradaan kiye
 Dr
 Ramvilas Sharma, a great critic of Hindi writes - "by publishing the poet word Sudha, Bharatendu heralded a new era
 " In the beginning, Bharatendu used to print the compositions of the old poets in 'kavyavashasudha', like Chand Bardai's Raso, Kabir's Sakhi, Jayasi's Padmavat, Bihari's Dohe, Dev's Ashtayam and Deendayalu Giri's Anurag Bagh
 lekin sheeghra hi patrika main nae kaviyon ko bhi sthaan milane laga
 In the magazine's entry, Bharatendu declared his ideal as follows - 'kavivachansudha' main sahitya to chhapata hi tha, uske alaava samachar, yatra, gyaan-vigyaan, dharm, raajnneeti or samaaj niti vishyak lekh bhi prakashit hote the
 This increased the popularity of the magazine
 lokapriya itani ki use masik se pakshik or phir saptahik kar diya gaya
 The magazine became fortnightly in its second year of publication and weekly from September 5, 1873
 kavivachansudha ke dwitiya prakaashan varsh main mustahed ke thik neeche nimnlikhit pad chhapata tha - Frustrated by Bhartendu's commentaries and angry at the "punch" of "kavibhaksudha", the magistrate of Kashi also stopped taking Bhartendu's letters to the Education Department
 saat varshon tak 'kavivachansudha' kaa sampadak-prakaashan karne ke baad bharatendu ne use apane mitra chintamani dhadfale ko saunp diya or 'harishchandra megsine' kaa prakaashan 15 oktober, 1873 ko banaras se armbh kiya
 There was a mention on the front page of 'harishchandra Magazine' that it is associated with 'kavikavasudha'

 The digestive system of humans consists of a dietary canal and associate glands
 aahaar-naal, mukhaguha, grasani, grasika, amashay, choti aant, badi aant, malashay or maladwar se bani hoti he
 Supporting digestive glands are the salivary gland, liver, gall bladder and pancreatic
 aahaar padaarthon ke vishesh ghatak protein, carbohydrate, vasa, vitamin, khanij lavan or jal hai
 All foods are made up of these components
 kisi main koi ghatak adhik hota he, koi kam
 Our body is also made of these ingredients
 sharir kaa 2 / 3 bhaag jal he
 Protein is the main body of the body from which organs are formed
 carbohydrate glucose ke rup main sharir main rahata he, jisaki mansapeshiyon ko sadaa aavashyaktaa hoti he
 An excessive amount of fat is also stored in the body
 vitamin or lavenon kii aavashyaktaa sharir kii kriyaaon ke uchit sampadan ke liye hoti hai
 Our body gets all these things from food
 haan, aahaar se milane vaale avyavon kaa rasinic rup sharir ke avyavon ke rup se bhinn hota he
 Therefore, the body decomposes the components of the diet into its subtle components by digestive juices and by re-synthesizing those components, prepares the ingredients suitable for them
 yah kaam angon kii koshikaaye karti hai
 It leaves out the components that are not useful
 sharir aise padaarthon ko mel, mutr, swead or shwaas dwaara baahar nikaal detaa he
 The purpose of digestion is to divide the esoteric ingredients of the diet into simple components
 yah kaary munh main lala ras dwaara, amashay main jathar ras dwaara, grahani main agnyashay ras tathaa pitt dwaara or kshundaatra main antraras dwaara sampadit hota he
 These works are briefly described here: mukh main aahaar daanton dwaara chabaakar sookshm kanon main vibhakt kiya jaataa he or usamen laar miltaa rahata hai, jisamen tylin naamak enzim mila rahata he
 This juice is made in the cupric gland outside the mouth and in the adrenal and adrenal glands
 in grathiyon se, visheshkar aahaar ko chabate samay unki vahniyon dwaara, laar ras munh main aata rahata he
 Its action is alkaline
 uske tylin anzime kii rasinic kriya visheshkar carbohydrate par hoti hai, jisase uskaa starch pehle dextrin main or tatpashchaat glucose main parivartit ho jaataa he
 The same changes in the sugar of ordinary reed
 aahaar ke grass ko geela or snigdh karnaa bhi lala kaa mukhya karm hai, jisase vah sahaj main niglaa ja sake or patala grass naal main hota hua amashay main pahunch jaay
 Swallowing is done inside the mouth by the muscles of the tongue and the muscles of the pharynx
 jihva kii peshiyon ke sankoch se jihva upar ko uthakar taalu or jihvaprishth par rakhe hue grass ko dabaati he, jo vahaan se phisalkar peeche grasani se chalaa jaataa he
 Immediately, the muscles of the pharynx hesitate and the Grass enters the esophagus, passing through the gland, where the circular and longitudinal sutures in its reefs lead it to the end of the placenta by its inhibition and expansion
 or grass jatharadwar dwaara amashay main pravesh karata he
 Digestion in the stomach is done by gastritis
 amashay kii shleshmal kala kii granthiyaan yah ras utpann karti hai
 When the food reaches the stomach, this juice starts to flow from the surrounding glands to the stomach at such a rapid rate as if it is being poured out
 is ras ke do mukhya avyav pepsin naamak angm or hydrochloric amla hote hai
 Pepsin has a special action on proteins, in which hydrochloric acid helps
 is kriya se protein pehle phool jaataa he or phir baahar se galane lagata he
 Due to this, the inner part of the grass gets late
 isse lala ke tilin enzim kii kriya us samay tak hoti rahati he jab tak lala kaa sara kshar amashay ke amlik ras dwaara udasin nahin ho jaataa
 Metaprotein is formed before protein by the action of gastric juice
 phir yah proteoseze main badal jaataa he
 The proteases then break down into peptones
 isse adhik parivartan nahin hota
 There are also two more enzymes in gastric juice, which are called amylase and lipase
 aimylez karbohydrate ko galaata he or lypez vasa ko
 It also contains renin, another enzyme that breaks down milk
 isamen halaki jeevanunashak shakti bhi hoti he
 The secretion of gastric juice is mainly under the nervous system
 sharirkriya vigyaan ke vikhyath roosi vidwaan pavelof ke prayogon ne is sambandh main bahut prakaash daalaa he
 It has been proved from them that the smell of food starts smelling from the nose and seeing them through the eyes
 yahi kaaran he ki uttam aahaar padaarthon ke banane kii gandh se hi bhukh maaloom hone lagati he tathaa unako dekhne se kshudha bad jaati he
 Applying on the tongue causes a desire to eat immediately
 yadi aahaar padaarth uttam yaa ruchikar nahin hote to bhukh mar jaati he
 Digestion of such food is also not done properly
 usase ras kaa srav bhi kam hota he
 The process of gastric juice is particularly on protein
 maance, anda, machhlee, doodh ke padaarthon aadi ke amashay main pahunchne par ras kaa srav hota hai
 If salt, ice or pebbles, etc
 are given to eat, there will be no discharge
 pachan se agnyashay or yakrut in do badi grathiyon kaa bahut sambandh he
 Pancreas juice is produced in the pancreas
 yah bahut hi prabal pachak ras he, jisaki kriya protein, carbohydrate tathaa vasa teenon ghatakon par hoti he
 It is formed by the cells of the pancreas gland and collected from all the pancreas, this juice reaches the duodenum through a duct
 pitashay se pitt ko laanevaali vahini is agnyashayvahini se milakar saamaanya pittavahini ban jaati he
 Through his mouth, both the pancreas and bile, the juices, reach the duodenum
 agnyashayi granthi udar main bain ore amashay ke peeche sthit he
 Its large head rests in the bend of the duodenum and its tail has gone to the left spleen
 iskaa rang kuch matamaila bhura sa hota he
 Its subtle parts appear to be raised like mulberry grains
 agnyashay ras kii prabal kriya visheshkar protein par hoti he
 This causes the protein to dissolve without bloating
 is ras kii kriya kshareey hoti he
 This causes the first alkaline metaprotein to form
 tab metaprotein se proteos banate hai
 The proteases are then converted into peptones
 ant main peptone ke vibhanjan se amino amla ban jate hai, jo protein ke pachan ke antim utpaada hote hai
 Peptones that come as a result of digestion of proteins from the stomach also break down into amino acids
 agnyashay ras ke srav par tantrika mandal kaa koi niyantran nahin he
 The stimulation of nerves does not produce more or less of the juice
 ras kii utpatti us samay prarambh hoti he jab amashay main paachit aahaar, jo ardh drav rup kaa hota he, amashay se pyloric chhidr dwaara nikalakar grahani main aata he
 Through contact with this acidic chym, a chemical substance called secretin is produced in the mucous level cells of the duodenum
 yah vastu rakt dwaara agnyashay kii koshikaon main pahunchakar unako ras banane ke liye uttejit karti he or tab ras banakar grahani main aane lagata he
 The second feature of this juice is that if this juice is collected in the pancreas before reaching the duodenum, it remains inactive
 uski protein par koi kriya nahin hoti
 When it joins the duodenum, it combines with the intestinal juice, only then it produces a strong power to decompose the protein
 yah mana jaataa he ki antric ras kaa anterokinage naamak enzim usko sakriy kar detaa he
 These are the following: udar ke daahine bhaag main upar kii ore sharir kii yakrut naamak sabase badi granthi he, jo pitt kaa nirmaan karti he
 From there, the bile gets collected in the gall bladder and reaches the duodenum by a duct during digestion
 yakrut se sidhaa grahani main bhi pahunch saktaa hai
 It is a thick green liquid
 vasa ke pachan main isse sahaayta milti he
 The food from the duodenum, which contains its digestible components, falls in the first part of the esophagus
 is samay vah shahad ke samaan gadha hota he or kshudantra main bhalee prakaar pravaahit ho saktaa he
 Digestion continues here too
 kuch samay tak agnyashayi pachan jari rahata he
 The juice of the intestines also has digestive power
 vah protein ko to nahin, kintu proteos or paptone ko amino amlon main tod saktaa he
 But its special action is to activate dipsin amylase and lipase enzymes
 pavelof kaa, jisane sabase pehle is vishay main anveshan kiye the, mat he ki antra ras ke milane se pehle ye teenon enzim apane purv rup main rahete hai or isi kaaran niskriy hote hai
 Trypsin lives as trypsinogen
 amiles or lypez bhi purv dasha main rahete hai
 When enterocrine is found in the pancreas, trypsinogen produces trypsin and the rest of the enzymes are also activated
 antric ras ke milane se purv agnyashay ras niskriy hota he
 The function of the esophagus is exclusively absorption
 isaki aantarik rachana ke chitra ko dekhne se maaloom hoga ki uske bheetar shleshmal kala main, jo saare antra ko bheetar se aachhadit kiye hue hai, gahari silawatein bani hui hai, jisase kala kaa prishth antra se kahin adhik ho jaataa he
 There are sprouts on the folds of art
 in sabakaa kaam avasorana karnaa he
 The subtle composition of the seedlings is also worth noting
 prayek ankur ke bich main ek shwetanlika uske shikhar ke paas tak chali gai he
 It is akshiravahini
 iske donon ore kaali rekhaayen dikhaai detii hai, jo dhamni or shiraaon kii shakhaayen or koshikaaye hai
 Both these types of structures, vessels and arteries and veins, go out or down and are found in the large blood vessels and vessels in the epidemiological level
 vasa kaa shleshmalkala dwaara avasorana hokar vah akshirvahiniyon main pahunch jaati he or ant main rakt main mil jaati he
 After absorption of glucose and protein they reach the blood by blood capillaries
 rakt in teenon avyavon ko sharir ke prayek ang kii koshikaon tak pahunchaata or unka poshan karata he
 This is the special function of the 20-22 feet long tubule
 brihadantra kaa kaary keval avasorana he
 This organ especially absorbs water
 malatyag ke samay mel jis rup main baahar nikalataa he, vah brihadantra ke ant or malashay main ban jaataa he
 In 24 hours, the colon absorbs water
 jal ke atirikt vah thode glucose kaa bhi avasorana karata he, par or kisi padaarth kaa avasorana nahin karata
 Apart from this, iron, magnesium, calcium etc
 are sacrificed in the colon itself
 yahan unka utsarg hokar ve mel main mil jate hai
 The action of bacteria also aids digestion
 kshudantra main ve protein, vasa tathaa starch aadi kaa bhanjan karte hai
 In the colon, they also dissolve cellulose, which does not contain any digestive juices
 isi se hydrogen sulphide, mithen aadi gaisen utpann hoti hai tathaa vasa ke bhanjan se vasaml banate hai, jinke kaaran mel kii kriya amlik ho jaati he
 This movement continues throughout the digestive tract, from the esophagus to the rectum, which leads to continued eating or digestion
 anya aashyon main tathaa vahikaaon main bhi yah gati hoti he
 There are circular circles outside the mucosa level and levels of longitudinal musculature outside them
 vrittakar sutron ke sankoch se naal kii chaudaai sankuchit ho jaati he
 Therefore, hesitantly, part of the diet ahead cannot return to the rear
 tabhi anudairdhya sutara sankoch karke naal ke us bhaag kii lambaai kam kar dete hai
 Therefore, the diet progresses further
 phir aage ke bhaag main isi prakaar kii kriya se vah or aage badhata he
 This is called entrapment
 duusari khandibhavan gati bhi naal kii bhitti main hoti rahati he
 These movements, in addition to helping to advance the diet, churn the chime in a good way, causing a close contact between the digestive juices and the particles of the diet
 bhinn bhinn pachak rason kii kriya kaa jo varnan kiya gaya he usase spasht he ki prakruti ne aisa prabandh kiya he ki aahaar padaarthon ke sab avyav, jo jautav sharir main bhi upasthit rahete hai, vyarth na jane paaen
 Use them as much as possible in the body
 unase sharir ke toote phute bhaagon kaa nirmaan ho, nae utak bhi bane or kaam karne kii urja utpann ho
 This is the purpose of diet and differentiating the different ingredients of the diet into their very subtle elements, so that they are absorbed and the cells of the body prepare their essential things from them, this is the purpose of digestion
 vastav main jisko saadhaaran bolchaal main pachan kaha jaataa he, usamen do kriyaaon kaa bhav chipa rahata he, pachan or avasorana
 Digestion is simply the breakdown of the components of the diet into its components, which are the result of digestive juices
 unka avasorana hokar rakt main pahunchnaa duusari kriya he, jo kshudantra ke rasankuron kaa vishesh karm he
 Any part of the diet that remains in the bowel after digestion and absorption is the same stool
 atev mel main aahaar kaa kuch apchy bhaag bhi hota he tathaa antra kii shleshmal kala ke tukade hote hai
 Apart from these, there are very large numbers of bacteria
 yah hisaab lagaaya gaya he ki prayek baar mel main 15,00,00,00,000 jeevanu sharir se nikalate hai
 They come from the colon itself
 vahi jeevanuon kaa nivasasthaan he
 Due to this there is a lot of nitrogen in the stool, which makes it a good fertilizer
 malatyag kii ek prativart kriya he, jiskaa sampadan tantric mandal ke aatmag vibhaag dwaara hota he
