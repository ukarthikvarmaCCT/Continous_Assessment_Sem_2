 From the biological point of view, a group of such organisms is called a caste which has the potential to produce offspring with each other and whose offspring themselves have the capacity to produce offspring further
 udhaaharan ke liye ek bhediya or sher aapas main baccha paidaa nahin kar sakate isliye ve alag jatiyon ke maane jate hai
 a horse and a donkey can produce a child among themselves, but because mules are unable to bear a child, horses and donkeys are also considered to be of different castes
 iske vipareet kute bahut alag aakaaron main milte hai lekin kisi bhi nar kute or maadaa kute ke aapas main bachche ho sakate hai jo swayan aage santan paidaa karne main sakasham hai
 Therefore, all dogs, irrespective of their race, are considered members of the same race from a biological point of view

 For example, horses, donkeys and zebras belong to different castes but all three are considered members of the same 'aquus' dynasty
 aadhunik kaal main jatiyon kii paribhaasha anya pahaluon ko jaanchakar bhi kii jaati hai
 For example, the DNA of organisms is often tested using genetics, and on this basis, those organisms that have a DNA imprint match each other and are distinct from other organisms

 Many examples of proposed castes should be studied by adding letters before it is considered a caste
 It is generally a short categorized category for those extinct species whose information is only possible from fossils
 kuch jeev vigyaani sankhyikeey ghatana ko praaniyon main dekhi gai jatiyon ke varg ke saath paramparaagat vichaar ke viruddh dekh sakate hai
 In such a situation, a species is defined as a distinctly involved lineage that forms a single gene pool
 haalanki gundharm jaise dna-kram or morphology ek duusare se bahut adhik sambandhit vansh ko pruthak karne main madad ke liye prayog karne vaale is paribhaasha main spasht simaaen hai
 However, the exact definition of the word "caste" is still controversial, especially in relation to the biosphere, and is called the caste problem
 jeev vigyaniyon ne adhik vistrut paribhaashaayen di hai, lekin prayog main aae keval kuch hi vikalp hai jo sambandhit jatiyon kii visheshtaon par nirbhar karti hai
 The names of commonly used plant and animal taxa are sometimes similar to these species: for example, "lion", "walrus," and "camphor tree" - denote each species
 anya maamle jinamein un naam kaa prayog nahin hota: "hiran" 34 jatiyon ke varg ko darshata he, jisamen ald hiran, laal hiran or barasingha shaamil hai
 The latter two castes were once considered to be the same caste, explaining how the boundaries of the castes could change with the increase of scientific knowledge
 duniya main donon ko paribhaashit karne or unki kul sankhya kii gananaa karne main kathinaaiyon ke kaaran, yah anumaan lagaaya jaataa he ki kahin par bhi is prakaar kii do evam 100 million / 2 se 100 million ke bich bhinn -bhinn jatiyaan ho sakati hai
 Ideally, a caste is formally given a scientific name, although in practice there are many such castes
 a caste is named when it is placed in lineage / lineage
 vaigyanik drushtikon se ise pariklpana mana ja saktaa he ki jatiyaan duusare vansh kii tulana main duusari jatiyon ke jinas se bahut adhik sambandhit hoti hai
 a common cast includes and / is best known as its classification category: life, region, state, caste, class, order, family, clan and caste
 Letting the genus determine it is not invariant; a classification scientist can later give it a different genus, due to which its name will also change
 jaivik namakaran main, kisi jati ke naam ke do bhaag hote hai, ve latin maane jate hai, haalanki kisi bhi mul bhashaa ke naam evam sthaan yaa vyakti ke naam kaa upyog uske liye kiya ja saktaa he
 The caste name is listed after the first, second word, special name

 keval duusare shabd main hi nahin jati ke naam purna rup se dwipadi hai
 This bipartisan naming tradition was later used by Leonhard Fuchs to convert the nomenclature to the biological code, and was released as a standard by the Carolus Linnaeus in the Species Plantarum in 1753

 "jati" shabd kii vyakhya karnaa vismayakari dhang se mushkil he jo sabhi prakritik praaniyon par lagu hota he or jatiyon kii vyakhya kaise karen ke bare main jeev vigyaniyon par lagu hote hai or vaastavik jatiyon kii pahchaan kaise karen ko jati samasya kaha jaataa he
 In most textbooks a race is a "real and potentially inter-breed natural population group" that is set apart as other such breeding groups
 is paribhaasha ke vibhinn bhaagon jaise kuch asaamaanya yaa kritrim samagam isse baahar rakhe gaye hai: The definition in the above ideal textbook works well for multi-cellular animals, but there are some situations where they can be ruled out as inappropriate: kshaitijiya jin sthanantaran shabd "jati" paribhaashit karne ko or bhi jatil bana dete hai
 There is strong evidence of horizontal gene transfer between unequal groups of the prokerat group and, at least often, unequal groups of eukaryates, and Williamson argues that there is some evidence available of this in crustaceans and echinoderms
 "jati" shabd kii sabhi paribhaashaayen ki kisi apane sabhi jin apane ek yaa do mata-pita se praapt hote hai us praani ke bilkul samaan hote hai, laqin aadharchyut jin sthanantaran is anumaan ko galat tehraata he
 One of the best questions is the term "caste" which is being described by zoologists and this discussion is known as the problem of castes
 darwin ne on da orijan of spasis ke adhyay II main likhaa
 But later, Darwin amended his view in The Descent of Man by saying "whether humans consist of one or many castes"
 vikaas kaa aadhunik siddhant "jati" kii nai moolbhoot paribhaashaon par nirbhar he
 Prior to Darwin, naturalists viewed castes as ideal or common types, which can be exemplified with an ideal model that has all the same qualities as a normal race
 darwin ke siddhant kii ekarupata ne dhyaan ko saadhaaran se vishesh kii taraf sthanantarit kar diya
 According to intellectual historian Lewis Meinand, yah "jati" ko nae drushtikon main badal detaa he; darwin In practice, biologists have defined castes as populations of animals that have high levels of genetic similarity
 yah usee jeevakosh ke anukulan ko pratibimbit or anuvaanshik saamagree kaa ek se duusare main sambhavit sadhano kii kismon ko sthanantarit kar sakati he
 The exact level of similarity in this type of definition is used unilaterally, but it is the most common definition used for animals that cause asexual reproduction, such as some plants and micro-organisms
 sookshm jeev vigyaan main kisi bhi spasht jati kii kami kii badhya ne kuch lekhakon ko tark dene ke liye badhya kar diya he ki jeevanu kaa adhyayan karte samay "jati" shabd kaa upyog sahi nahin he
 Instead, they observed genes far-flung related bacteria, bacteria associated with the entire bacterial region, with a gene pool independently
 phir bhi, anguuthe ke niyam kii sthapana yah kehete hue kii gai ki ve ek duusare se 97% se adhik samaan 16S rrna jin kram bacteria yaa orchia kii jaanch DNA-DNA sankaran dwaara kii jaani chahie chahen vah samaan jati se sambandhit hon athwa nahin
 The concept has recently been updated, stating that the 97% threshold was too low and could be increased to 98
7%
 yon rup se paidaa hone vaale jeevon, jahaan par jin sambandhi saamagree ko prajnan sambandhi prakriya main saajha kiya jaataa he, to do praaniyon ke antar janan prakriya or donon lingon ke sankar vansh samaan sanketak ke rup main sweekaar kiye jate hai ki praaniyon ne samaan jati ke sadsy ke rup main prachur jeenon ko apanaaya he
 In a way "caste" is a group of inter-breeding beings
 is paribhaasha ko yah kehete hue aage badhaayaa ja saktaa he ki jati praaniyon kaa vah samooh he jo sambhavit taur se antarjaatiy prajnan karne main sakasham he - machhliyon ko usee jati main rakhaa ja saktaa he bhale hi ve bhinn-bhinn jhiilon main rahati hon kyonki ve antarjaatiy prajnan kar sakati hai yadi ve kabhi bhi ek duusare ke sampark main aayin hon
 duusari ore, teen yaa adhik vicitra aabaadi vaale bahut se udhaaharan hai ki kya bich main aabaadi vaale jantu duusare prakaar kii aabaadi vaale jantuon main antar prajnan kar sakate hai lekin duusari taraf aabaadi vaale ye jantu antar prajnan karne main sakasham nahin hai
 Thus, it is debatable whether these populations constitute one or two different castes
 isamen koi virodhabhas nahin he ki jatiyon ko jin aavritiyon ke aadhaar par paribhaashit kii jaati hai or is prakaar se unki aspasht simaaen hai
 Consequently, the universal definition of "caste" is necessarily unilateral
 iske bajaay, jeev vigyaniyon ne bahut si paribhaashaayen di hai; jiskaa upyog koi jeev vigyaani ke liye paripurna vikalp he, vah us jeev vigyaani ke shodh kii visheshtaon par nirbhar karata he
 In practice, these definitions are similar and their case is more important than the outright contradiction between them
 phir bhi, abhi tak prastaavit jati kii koi bhi avadharana puri tarah se uddeshypurna nahin he yaa kisi nirnay ke liye sahaayta liye bina sabhi maamalon main lagu ho saktaa he
 Given the complexity of life, some say that the definition of such an objective is impossible in all kinds of possibilities and that biologists must determine the most plausible definition
 adhikansh ridh vihin praaniyon main yah sabhi jaivik jatiyon kii avadharana he or filogenetic jati kii avdhaaran main kaaphi had tak kam he
 Many BSC sub-castes are considered castes under the PSC; The difference between BSC and PSC can be determined because the BSC defines race as a result of a clear evolutionary history, whereas PSC defines a race as a result of a clear evolutionary possibility
 is prakaar se, PSC jatiyon ko "banaaya" gaya jaise hi vikasvaadi vansh ko alag kiya janaa shuru hua, jabaki BSC jati ne keval tabhi nikalnaa shuru kiya jab unka vansh kaa algaav purna ho gaya
 Accordingly, substantial controversy between alternative classifications based on PSC vs
 BSC is possible because they are totally different depending on the behavior of their taxa, which would be considered sub-casts under the latter model
 jivan ke samarthan vaali jatiyaan: kai jatiyaan paryaavaran ke anukulan ke prati bilkul vicitra hoti hai, kyonki ve kuch sthitiyon ke antargat paidaavaar yaa prajnan karne main sakasham hai jaise sookhaa, banjar, baadh, mitti kii vishaaktata, mitti kii lavanta jinamein se bahut se bhojan, samagriyaan pradaan karte hai or maanav ko shakti pradaan karne vaale pashudhan or anya jaanwaron manushya ke liye sambhavit rup se laabhakaari maane jate hai or ye jivan sahaayak jatiyon ke rup main jaani jaati hai
 As such they consist of mutual main castes because they have the main key to the integrity of the landforms that comprise the bio-data and human communities of both creatures
 donon paristhitiki or saamaajik aarthik jatiyaan jivan ke liye sahaayak jatiyaan hai
 Considering the problems mentioned earlier with the classification of castes, the following numbers are merely nominal guidance
 2007 main, ve nimnanusaar the: Total number of castes: 7-100 million including: eukrayete jatiyon main se hamane keval inaki pahchaan hi kar sake: Currently, the Global Texonomy Initiative, the European Distributed Institute of Texonomy and the Census of Marine Life are attempting to reform the taxonomy and implement the taxonomy system from previously unknown nations
 is satya ke kaaran ki ham jeev mandal main keval kuch praaniyon ko hi jaanate hai, phir bhi hamen apane paryaavaran ke kaamkaaj kii puri samaj nahin he
 According to Professor James Mellet, despite the discovery of new castes, we are making matters worse and we are ending these castes with unprecedented speed
 iskaa matlab yah bhi he ki kisi nai jati ko praapt karne se pehle iskaa adhyayan or vargeekaran kiya janaa chahie, chunki ho saktaa he ki vah pehle se hi vilupt ho chuki ho
 The notion of castes has a long history
 kai kaarnon se yah vargeekaran ke sabase mahatvapurn staron main se ek he: After years of experimentation, the concept of biology has been prominent as a host of related fields but has not yet been fully defined
 kisi vishesh jati ke namakaran ke jeevon ko us samooh ke jeevon ke vikasvaadi sambandh or or unki vividhta ke bare main pariklpana maani jaani chahie
 The hypothesis can be confirmed or refuted as advance information comes in hand
 kabhi-kabhi, khaskar jab ateet main sanchaar bahut adhik mushkil tha, to algaav par kaary karne vaale vargeekaran vaigyanikon ne alag-alag jantuon ko alag-alag naam die jinaki pahchaan baad main ek samaan jati ke rup main kii gai
 When a two-name caste was discovered as a single caste, the old caste name was usually retained and the new caste name was given that name, a process that is synonymous with aggregation or a colloquial process
 It is called
 texon ko ek se adhik main vibhajit karne main aamtaur se nayaa vaala vibhaajan texons kehalaata he
 Taxonomy Scientists are usually called "lumpers" or "splitters" by their classmates, depending on their individual attitudes and similarities to the differences identified between animals
 paramparaagat rup se, shodhakarta sanrachanaatmak antaron ke avlokan or is avlokan par ki kya bhinn aabaadi main jatiyon main atar ke liye unka antar prajnan safaltaapurvak kiya gaya athwa nahin, par bharosa karte hai; donon sharir rachana or prajnan vyavhaar donon hi abhi bhi jatiyon kii sthiti bataane ke liye mahatvapurn hai
 In the last few decades, as a result of the revolution in microbiological research techniques, DNA analysis has provided unfathomable knowledge about differences and similarities between castes
 kai aabaadiyaan jo pehle pruthak jatiyon ke rup main maani jaati thim ko ab ek texonmana jaataa he or purv samoohikrut aabaadi ko vibhajit kiya gaya he
 Any classification level can be synonymous or subdivided, and at higher taxonomic levels these modifications are still very unfathomable
 vargeekaran ke drushtikon se, jati main samoohon ko jati kii tulana main texon vargeekaran ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 Only sub-castes are used in zoology whereas diversity, sub-diversity and form have been used in botany
 sangrakshan jeev vigyaan main, vikasvaadi mahatvapurn ikai kaa upyog kiya jaataa he jise jati yaa adhik choti vicitra aabaadi vaale khand ke rup main paribhaashit kiya ja saktaa he
 In the early work of science, castes were simply individual beings representing their own or nearly identical group of beings
 us samay un par inke alaava koi anya sambandh lagu nahin hote the
 Aristotle used the term genus and caste to refer to caste or special classes
 arestu or anya purv-darvinian vaigyanikon ne jatiyon ko "saar" jaise rasinic tatwon ke rup main vishesh or aparivartaneey mana
 jab aarambhik prekshkon ne jeevon ke liye sanghathan ko pranali ke rup main viksit karnaa chaalu kiya, to unhone pehle se pruthak ko is sthaan par rakhana aarambh kar diya
 Many of these early illustration schemes will no longer be considered eccentric and include colors or behaviors based on coherence
 18 veen sadi main swedish vaigyanik carolas linius ne prajnan angon ke anusaar jeevon kaa vargeekaran kiya
 Although their type of classification of organisms classified organisms according to similarity, they did not make any claims about the relationship between similar castes
 
 us samay, vyapak rup se abhi bhi yah vishwaas kiya jaataa tha ki jatiyon ke madhya koi bhi mana he ki vahaan jaivik jatiyon ke bich koi bhi jaivik sambandh nahin tha, bhale hi ve kitne hi samaan dikhaai kyon na dete hon
 is drushtikon ne bhi ek prakaar ke adarshavaad kaa suzav diya: yah dharna ki maujuuda sabhi jatiyaan ek "adarsh swaroop" he
 Although there are always differences between all the organisms over there, Linnaeus considered such differences problematic
 He attempted to identify individual organisms which were exemplary of castes and considered other non-exemplary organisms to be unusual and incomplete
 19 veen sadi tak adhikansh prakrutivaadee samaj gaye the ki jati samay samay par badal sakati hai or yah ki grih ke itihaas ne unamem mukhya parivartanon ke liye paryaapt samay diya tha
 jean-baptiste Lamarck gave the first logical idea against creation-theory in Zoological Philosophy
 jatiyaan samay ke saath-saath kaise badal sakati he ke nirdhaaran ke bare main nai praathamikta thi
 Lamarck suggested that the organism could pass on an inherited trait to its incoming lineage, such as reaching the leaves of a giraffe's long neck-high trees was a trait of the giraffe's generation
 haalanki, 1860 main charles darwin kii prakritik chayan vichaar kii sweekruti ke saath, lenmark ke lakshya-unmukh vikaas ke drushtikon jise teleological prakriya ke rup main bhi janaa jaataa he ko prabhaavaheen kar diya gaya tha
 Recent interest in inheritance of features acquired around methylation processes such as methylation that does not affect DNA sequence, but expression may be altered in an inherited manner
 is prakaar, nio-lamarkwaad, jiseki kabhi-kabhi iske bare main baat bhi hui hai ki prakritik chayan ke saath vikaas kaa siddhant koi chunauti nahin he
 Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace gave the idea which is still followed by the theory of scientific development in the most powerful and compelling form
 darwin ne tark diya ki yah shaamil aabaadi hi thi koi praani maatr nahin
 His argument is more credible than the perspective of Linnaeus's radical stream: Instead of interpreting race as an ideal term, Darwin considered the difference between organisms to be natural
 He further argues that his explanation for the existence of a rare caste, far from problematic, was in fact
 darwin ke kaam ne thomas malthske antardrushti ko apni taraf aakarshith kiya ki jaivik jansankhya kii vruddhi dar paryaavaran main sansadhano kii vruddhi dar se hameshaa aage rahegi jiseki bhojan kii aapurti
 iske parinamswaroop, darwin ne tark diya ki aabaadi ke sabhi jeev nirvaah or prajnan karne main sakasham nahin honge
 The work done by them will be average, but there will be a difference - although they will make it a little more environmentally friendly
 If the difference of these qualities is ancestral, then the descendants of the survivors will take them
 is prakaar, kai pidiyon se anukuli vividhtaayen aabaadi main jamaa ho jaaengi, jabaki pratikul gun samaapt ho jaaenge
 It should be emphasized whether a difference in the environment is adaptive or non-adaptive: different environments favor different qualities
 kyonki paryaavaran hi kargar dhang se is baat kaa chayan karata he ki kis praani ko prajnan ke liye jivit rahanaa he or vah paryaavaran hi he jo is baat kaa nirdhaaran karte he ki kaunse gun aage jane chahie
 It is the principle of evolution by natural selection
 is model main, ek jiraph kii gardan kii lambaai kii vyakhya sthiti ke anusaar kii jaaegi ki lambii gardan vaale proto-jiraph ne vishesh prajnankaree visheshaataaon ko choti gardan vaale jiraph se praapt kiya kai pidiyon se, puri aabaadi lambii gardan vaale pashuon kii jati kii hogi
 In 1859, when Darwin published his theory of natural selection, there was no knowledge of mechanisms with individual properties of inheritance at that time
 haalanki darwin ne gun ke vanshanukram se praapt hone ke bare main kuch kalpanaaen kii, lekin usnaa siddhant keval is sachai par aadhaarit tha ki vanshanukram gun maujuud hote hai or ve parivartanashin hote hai
 However, the paper on Gregor Mandel's genetics was published in 1866 without identifying its characteristics
 is par 1900 tak koi kaary nahin kiya gaya jab unke kaary kii pun: khoj hugo di verise, karl corence or erik won semark dwaara tab kii gai jab unhen is baat kaa abhas hua ki darwin ke siddhant main "vanshanukram gun" jin hai
 The classification of castes of evolution through natural selection has two important assumptions for the discussion of castes - those results fundamentally challenge Linnaeus's hypotheses in favor of taxonomies
 sabase pehle isse yah pataa chalaa ki jatiyaan keval samaan nahin hai balki ve vastav main sambandhit bhi ho sakati he
 Some Darwin students argue that all species are descendants of common ancestors
 doosraa, yah mana jaataa he ki "jati" sajaateey, sthir, sthaayee chijen nahin he; jati ke sadsy bilkul bhinn hai or bahut samay pehle jatiyon main parivartan hua he
 This suggests that castes have no particular boundary region but have statistically significant effects of continuously changing gene-frequencies
 abhi bhi koi vyakti linius ke vargeekaran kaa upyog paudhon or jaanwaron kii pahchaan ke liye kar saktaa he, lekin koi bhi vyakti ab jatiyon ke swatantra or aparivartaneey rup ke bare main soch bhi nahin saktaa
 The development of a new caste from the ancestral lineage is called speciation
 isaki vanshaj jati se purvaj jati kaa nirdhaaran koi spasht vansh vaala simakan nahin he
 However, current scientific knowledge of castes has shown that in all cases there is no concrete and comprehensive way to differentiate between different castes, so that zoologists continue to look for concrete methods to carry out the idea
 
 One of the most popular biological definitions about race is in terms of reproductive isolation, if two animals are not capable of breeding hybrid offspring of both sexes, they belong to different races
 is paribhaasha main sahaj gyaan yukt jatiyon kii simaaen hai, lekin yah apurna hai
 For example, there is nothing to say about the caste that breed asexually and it is very difficult to apply it to the extinct castes
 iske alaava, jatiyon ke bich kii simaaen aksar aspasht hoti hai: aise kai udhaaharan hai jahaan par kisi vishesh aabaadi ke sadsy duusari aabaadi vaale praaniyon ke saadh jananksham sankar vansh kaa prajnan karte hai or duusari aabaadi ke sadsy teesri aabaadi vaale praaniyon ke saadh upjau sankar vansh kaa prajnan kar sakate hai lekin pehali or teesri aabaadi vaale sadsy upjau sankar kaa prajnan nahin kar sakate yaa keval mata pita se hi upjau vansh ko janm sambhav he
 As a result, some people reject this definition of caste
 richard daakins do praaniyon kii vyakhya sajaatiyata ke rup main karte hai or yadi unke chromosomes kii sankhya samaan hoti he or prayek chromosomam ke liye donon praaniyon main samaan sankhya main gunasutra hote hai 
 haalanki, adhiktar sabhi vargeekaran vaigyanik is bate se asahmat honge
 For example, in many amphibians, especially in New Zealand, the genome of Leopelma frogs has "native" genomes that are not distinct and have secondary chromosomes that exist in many combinations
 haalanki, aabaadi ke gunasutron kii sankhya main atyadhik antar paaya jaataa he, phir bhi ye safaltaapurvak antar prajnan kar sakate hai or ek ekal vikaskaari ikai banaate hai
 In plants, polyploidy is a highly common site with some inhibitions on differential reproduction; Because sets of chromosomes of animals are dissected by even numbers, which depends on the actual number of sets of current chromosomes where some animals of the same evolutionary unit can interbreed with some others and some and not the entire population
 Has been specifically linked to form a common gene pool
 jatiyon kaa vargeekaran vishesh taur se takneekee pragati se prabhavit ho rahaa he jisaki anumati shodhakartaaon ne unke sambandh ko anvik nishaan ke aadhaar par, crude rakt plasma vaale teevr pramaanon ko 20veen shatabdi ke madhya main charles sible ke ground-braking DNA-DNA sankaran adhyayan, 1970 main, kii tulana main DNA takanic anukraman ko janm diya
 These techniques resulted in radical changes in the higher taxonomic classes, leading to the rearranged results of many branches of the phylogenetic tree
 For the taxonomic sections of Jainra below, the results were mixed together; At the molecular level, the pace of evolutionary change was slowed, giving clear differences only after a suitable period of reproductive isolation
 While the results of DNA – DNA hybridization were misleading, the Pomeranian Scoa - Great Scoa phenomenon became a well-known example

 ye dilli se hai
 The description of Ganga is found somewhere in the Rigveda, but the stories related to Ganga in the Puranas came on their own
 kaha jaataa he ki ek prafullit sundari yuvati kaa janm brahmadev ke kamandal se hua
 There are two thoughts about this special birth
 ek kii manyata he ki vaaman rup main rakshas bali se sansar ko mukt karaane ke baad brahmadev ne bhagwaan vishnu kaa charan dhoyaa or is jal ko apane kamandal main bhar liya
 The second is related to Lord Shiva who saved the raga-ragini suffering from the misuse of music
 jab bhagwaan shiv ne naarad muni brahmadev tathaa bhagwaan vishnu ke samaksh gaanaa gaaya to is sangeet ke prabhaav se bhagwaan vishnu kaa pasinaa bahakar nikalne laga jo brahma ne use apane kamandal main bhar liya
 Ganga was born from the water of this kamandal and she started living in heaven under the protection of Brahma
 aisi kimbadanti he ki prithvi par ganga kaa avataran raja bhagirath ke kathin tap se hua, jo suryavanshi raja tathaa bhagwaan ram ke purvaj the
 Next to the temple is a Bhagirath Shila where Bhagiratha worshiped Lord Shiva
 kaha jaataa he ki jab raja sagar ne apana 100waan ashwamegh yajna kiya to indradev ne apana rajya chhin jane ke bhay se bhaybheet hokar us ghode ko kapil muni ke ashram ke paas chipa diya
 While searching for the horse, 60,000 sons of King Sagara harassed and humiliated Kapil Muni who was absorbed in asceticism
 kshubdh hokar kapil muni ne aagney drushti se tatkshan sabhi ko jalaakar bhasma kar diya
 On apologizing, the sage said that the soul of the sons of King Sagara will be liberated only when Gangajal touches them
 sagar ke kai vanshajon dwaara aradhana karne par bhi ganga ne avatarit hona asweekaar kar diya
 In the end, King Bhagirath, a descendant of King Sagara, meditated for 5500 years to please the gods
 unki bhakthi se khush hokar devi ganga ne prithvi par aakar unke shaapit purvajon kii aatma ko mukti dena sweekaar kar liya
 There was a possibility of heavy destruction due to the descent of Goddess Ganga on the earth and hence Lord Shiva was persuaded to tie Ganga in his jata
 (gangotri kaa arth hota he ganga utari arthath ganga neeche utar ai isaliye yah shahar kaa naam gangotri padaa
 Bhagirath then told Ganga to go to the place where the ashes of his ancestors lay and thus his soul was liberated
 parantu ek or durghatana ke baad hi yah hua
 Ganga immersed the ashram of Jahnu Muni in water
 muni krodh main puri ganga ko hi pi gayi par bhagirath ke aagrah par unhone apane kaan se ganga ko baahar nikaal diya
 That is why Ganga is also called Jahnavi
 barfili nadi gangotri ke muhane par, shivlinga chotii ke aadhaar sthal par ganga prithvi par utari jahaan se usne 2,480 kilometre gangotri se bengal kii khadi tak kii yatra shuru kii
 At the origin of this huge river, its name is Bhagirathi, which is in the name of that great ascetic Bhagiratha, on whose insistence Ganga left heaven and came to earth
 devprayag main alaknanda se milane par iskaa naam ganga ho gaya
 It is believed that the Pandavas, the heroes of the epic Mahabharata, performed the Dev Yagna at Gangotri to make atonement on the death of their relatives in Kurukshetra
 ganga ko praayah shiv kii jataaon main rahane ke kaaran bhi aadar paati he
 a second kimbadanti is that Ganga descended on the earth in human form and she married King Shantanu, the ancestor of the Pandavas where she gave birth to seven children and threw them into the river without giving any reason
 raja shantnu ke hastkshep karne par aathven putr bhishma ko rahane diya gaya
 But then Ganga left them and went away

 Cancer is a class of diseases in which a group of cells exhibit uncontrolled growth, disease invasion and sometimes mutation or metastasis
 karkat ke ye teen durdam lakshan ise saumy gaanth se vibhedit karte hai, jo swayan simit hai, aakraamak nahin hai yaa apararoopantaran prardashit nahin karte hai
 Most cancers make a knot or abdura, but some, such as blood, do not form a knot
 chikitsa kii vah shakha jo karkat ke adhyayan, nidaan, upachaar or rokthaam se sambandhit he, onchology yaa arbudvigyaan kehalaati he
 Cancer can affect people of all ages, even the fetus, but the risk of most varieties increases with age
 karkat main se 13% kaa kaaran he
 According to the American Cancer Society, 76 million people worldwide died of cancer during 2007
 karkat sabhi jaanwaron ko prabhavit kar saktaa he
 Almost all cancerous cells are caused by abnormalities in the genetic material
 ye asaamanyataayen carcinogen yaa kaa karkatjan ke kaaran ho sakati hai jaise tambaaku dhumrapaan, vikiran, rasayan, yaa sankramak kaarak
 karkat ko utpann karne vaali anya anuvanshik asaamanyataayen kabhi kabhi DNA karkat pratikruti main truti ke kaaran ho sakati hai, yaa anuvanshik rup se praapt ho sakati hai or is prakaar se janm se hi sabhi koshikaon main upasthit hoti hai
 The heredity of cancer is generally affected by the complex interactions between carcinogens and the nutrient genome
 karkat rogajanan kii anuvanshiki ke nae pahalu jaise DNA methilikaran or micro RNA, kaa mahatva teji se bad rahaa he
 Genetic abnormalities found in cancer usually affect two common classes of genes
 karkat ko badhaava dene vaale arbudjin praroopik rup se karkat kii koshikaon main sakriy hote hai, un koshikaon ko nae gun de dete hai, jaise saamaanya se adhik vruddhi or vibhaajan, kramadeshit koshika mrityu se suraksha, saamaanya utak simaaon kaa abhaav or vividh utak vaataavaran main sthapit hone kii kshamta
 Thereafter, knot suppressor genes are inactivated in cancer cells, resulting in a loss of normal function of those cells, such as correct DNA replication, control of the cell cycle, orientation and adhesion within tissues, and the immune system
 Interaction with protective cells

 Most cancer diseases can be treated, some can be cured, depending on the particular type, condition and condition of the cancer
 ek baar nidaan ho jane par, karkat kaa upachaar shalya chikitsa, rasayan chikitsa or vikiran chikitsa ke sangyojan ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 With the development of research, treatments for different varieties of cancer are becoming more specific
 lakshith therapy dawaaon ke vikaas main mahatvapurn pragati hui he jo vishisht gaanth main jaanch yogya aanvik asaamanyataon par vishesh rup se kaary karti hai or saamaanya koshikaon main kshati ko kam karti hai
 Early diagnosis of cancer patients is strongly influenced by the type of cancer, as well as the condition and extent of the disease

 The following closely related words can be used to designate abnormal growth: vartmaan angrezi main, yadhyapi, shabd tumor, nioplasm, vishesh rup se thos nioplasm kaa paryaay ban gaya he
 Note that some neoplasms, such as blood cancer, do not form a knot
 ek karkatka varnan karne ke liye nimna shabdon kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 There are more than 100 types of cancer
 cancer ke prakaar kaa naam ,aamtaur par un angon yaa utakon ke liye naam diya jaataa he ,jahaan cancer shuru hota hai, lekin unhen un koshikaon ke prakaar ke naam se bhi janaa jaataa he jinase wo banate he

 ye kramshah utak vigyaan or sthaan hai
 Common category examples include: in main se adhikansh ganthen bacchon main aam hai
 The names of dormant knots typically use words such as -carcinoma, -sarcoma or -blastoma as suffixes, with the Latin or Greek word for organ of origin as the root word
 udhaaharan ke liye, yakrut kaa karkat hepetocarcinoma kehalaata he; vasa koshikaon kaa karkat liposarcoma kehalaata he
 For common cancers, the English name of the organ is used
 udhaaharan ke liye stan cancer kaa sabase saamaanya prakaar stan kaa vahini parak carcinoma yaa mameri dakatal carcinoma kehalaata he
 Here the adjective ducktail is used to refer to the cancer seen in the microscope, which is similar to normal breast vessels
 vahini shabd kaa upyog, sookshmdarshi main dikhaai dene vaali stan vahiniyon ke karkat ke liye kiya gaya he
 The benign knot is the -oma suffix used in his name, with the root word being the name of the organ
 udhaaharan ke liye, garbhashay kii chikani peshi kii ek saumy gaanth leyomyoma kehalaati he
 Unfortunately, the -oma suffix is also used for certain types of cancers, such as melanoma and seminoma
 mote taur par, karkat ke lakshanon ko teen samoohon main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he: Although developed cancer may be painful, it is often not the initial symptom
 uparokt suchi main se prayek lakshan kai prakaar kii sthitiyon ke kaaran ho saktaa he 
karkat prayek mad ke liye ek aam yaa asaamaanya kaaran ho saktaa he
 Cancer is a class of different diseases that vary widely in their causes and biology
 koi bhi jeev, yahaan tak ki paudhon, main bhi karkat cancer ho saktaa he
 Almost all cancer cancers grow slowly, cancer and cancer cells and its daughter cells cause an error
 koi bhi cheez jo pratikruti karti he sambhavatya trutiyon se peedit ho sakati hai 
 yadi truti sudhaar or rokthaam thik prakaar se na kiya jaye trutiyaan bani rahengi or putree koshikaon ko bhi sthanantarit ho sakati hai
 Generally, the body tries to avoid against cancer through several methods, such as: apoptosis, accessory molecules, possibly chronicity, etc
 haalanki ye truti sudhaar vidhiyaan chote myanon main aksar asafal ho jaati hai, vishesh rup se aise vaataavaran main jahaan trutiyon ke utpann hone or badhane kii sambhaavnaaen adhik hoti hai
 For example, such an atmosphere may contain disruptive elements known as carcinogens
 yaa aavadhik chot ho sakati he, yaa vaataavaran jisamen koshikaayen apane astitv ke liye viksit nahin hui hon, jaise hypoxia 
 In this way, cancer is a progressive disease and these progressive errors keep accumulating in the cell gradually until the cell present in the animal starts to work in opposite to its functions
 ve trutiyaan jo karkat kaa kaaran hoti hai, aksar swa-pravardhansheel hoti hai, antat ek ghaateey dar par badhati hai
 for example: is prakaar se karkat aksar kuch trutiyon ke kaaran ek shrinkhalaa abhikriya ke rup main visphotit hota he, ye trutiyaan sanyukt hokar adhik gambhir trutiyaan banaati hai
 Errors that cause more errors are effectively the root cause of cancer and, at the same time, the reason that cancer treatment is very difficult: even after killing all of the cancer's 10,000,000,000 cells
 , Only 10 cells of them can do their replication or send the error-causing signals to other cells then the process starts again
 yah vidroh sadrush paridrishy avaanchhneeya yogyatam kii uttarjivita he, jahaan vikasvaadi bal khud sharir ke dizin or vyavastha ko lagu karne ke viruddh kaary karte hai In fact, once the cancer begins to develop, this same force helps the progression of the cancer towards more aggressive states, and this is called clonal development
 karkat ke kaarnon ke bare main anusandhan aksar nimnlikhit shreniyon main aate hai: Cancer mutations cause DNA mutation that affects cell growth and metastasis
 ve padaarth jo DNA utparivartan kaa kaaran hai utparivartajan kehalaate hai or ve utparivartajan jo karkat kaa kaaran hai, carcinogen kehalaate hai
 Many special types of substances are associated with specific types of deflection
 tambaaku dhumrapaan karkat ke kai roopon se sambandhit he, or 90% fefdon ke cancer kaa kaaran he
 Mizothelioma can occur due to exposure to asbestos fibers for a long time
 anek utparivartajan carcinogen bhi hai, lekin kuch carcinogen utparivartajan nahin hai
 Alcohol is an example of a chemical carcinogen that is not a mutagen
 is prakaar ke rasayan koshika vibhaajan kii dar ko utprerit karke cancer ko badhaava dete hai
 The rapid rate of replication allows less time for enzymes to be repaired, thereby not finding enough time to repair damaged DNA during DNA replication, which increases the likelihood of a mutation
 kai dashakon ke anusandhan tambaaku ke upyog or phuffus, swar yantra, sir, gardan, amashay, mutrashay, vrikk, grasani or agnashay ke cancer ke bich sambandh ko prardashit karte hai
 Fifty known carcinogens, including nitrosamine and multicomponent hydrocarbons, are found in tobacco smoking
 Tobacco is responsible for one in three cancer deaths in the developed world, and about one in five deaths worldwide
 darasal, sanyukt rajya america main phuffus kii cancer mrityu kii dar ne dhumrapan ke praturup ko pratibimbit kiya he, jiske anusaar dhumrapan main vruddhi ke saath phuffus cancer mrityu dar main vruddhi hoti he or adhik haal hi main darshaya gaya ki dhumrapan main kami se purushon main phuffus cancer mrityu dar main bhi kami hoti he
 Although the number of smokers is still increasing around the world, the situation caused by some organizations has been described as a tobacco epidemic
 ynikaran karne vaale vikiran ke strot jaise radon gas, cancer paidaa kar sakate hai
 Prolonged exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation can cause melanoma and other skin malignancies
 mobile phone or anya sroton se nikalne vaale gaiyr-ynikaran aavruti vikiran bhi cancer kaa kaaran maane gaye hai, lekin aise sambandh ke bahut kam pramaan mili hai
 Nevertheless, some experts recommend avoiding exposure to such things for a long time based on the precautionary principle
 kuch karkat rogazanq ke sankraman ke kaaran ho sakate hai
 Many cancers are caused by a virus infection; This is especially seen in birds such as animals, but also in humans, viruses are responsible for 15% of human cancers worldwide
 maanav ke cancer se sambandhit mukhya virus hai maanav pepiloma virus, hepatitis bi or hepatitis si virus, epstin-baar virus or maanav tii -limphotropic virus
 Experimental and epidemiological data indicate a causative role of viruses and have emerged as the second most important risk factor for the development of cancer in humans, with the first factor being tobacco use
 virus-prerit ganthon ko do prakaaron main vibhajit kiya ja saktaa he, tivrata se roopantarit hone vaale or dhire dhire roopantarit hone vaale 
 In rapidly converting viruses, the virus carries a hyperactive oncogene called viral-oncogene and the infected cell quickly mutates with the expression of v-onc
 iske vipareet, dhire dhire roopantarit hone vaale virus main, virus jinom, poshi ke jinom main ek proto-onkosin ke paas pravisht hota he
 Now viral promoters or other transcriptional regulation elements cause over-expression of that proto-oncogene
 isamen aniyantrit koshika vibhaajan shaamil he
 Because the location of insertion is not specific to proto-oncogenes, and no proto-oncogene has a low chance of insertion, slow-converting viruses, as compared to fast-converting viruses, have a longer duration of infection
 Produce knots after time
 hepatitis bi or hepatitis si sahit hepatitis virus, ek dirghakaalik viral sankraman ko prerit kar saktaa he, jo prativarsh hepatitis bi ke 0
47% rogiyon main or prati varsh hepatitis si ke 1
4% rogiyon main yakrut cancer kaa kaaran he
 Liver cirrhosis, whether due to chronic viral hepatitis infection or due to drinking, is associated with the development of liver cancer and the combination of cirrhosis and viral hepatitis is the cause of the highest risk of liver cancer development
 duniya bhar main viral hepatitis ke sancharan or rog ke baari boj ke kaaran, yakrut cancer sabase aam or sabase adhik ghaatak canceron main se ek he

 In fact, cancer from one organism usually grows to another organism of the same species only if they both have the same tissue mutation gene, as has been proven using mice; However this never happens in the real world except as described above
 maanav ke alaava anya jeevon main kuch aise prakaar ke cancer paae gaye hai jo khud gaanth kii koshikaon ke sancharan ke dwaara hote hai
 This phenomenon has been observed in dogs with sticker sarcoma, also known as canyon transmissible venal tumors and Devil facial tumor disease in the Tasmanian Devil
 cancer mularoop main utak vikaas ke viniman kaa ek rog he
 To convert a normal cell into a cancer cell, genes that regulate cell growth and differentiation must be transformed
 anuvanshik parivartan kai staron par ho sakate hai, ye pur gunasutra ke laabh yaa haani ke rup main ho sakate hai, jo utparivartan kaa hi ek rup he or ek maatr DNA neucliotoide ko prabhavit karata he
 There are two broad categories of genes that are affected by these changes
 onkosin saamaanya jin ho sakate hai, jo anupyukt rup se ucch str par prakat hote hai, yaa parivartit jin jinamein noval gun hote hai
 In any case, expression of these genes promotes the malignancy pattern of cancer cells
 ganth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ve jin he jo cancer kii koshikaon ke koshika vibhaajan, astitv, yaa anya gunon ko sandamit karte hai
 Lump suppressor genes are often disabled by genetic changes that promote cancer
 aamtaur par, ek saamaanya koshika ko cancer koshika main roopantarit karne ke liye kai jeenon main parivartan hone jaruri hai
 There is a diverse classification scheme for different genomic changes, which can contribute to the production of cancer cells
 in main se adhikansh parivartan utparivartan hote hai, yaa jinomik DNA ke newcliotide anukraman main parivartan hote hai
 Aneuploidy, the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is a genomic change that is not a mutation and may involve the gain or loss of one or more chromosomes by error in mitosis
 bade paimaane ke utparivartano main shaamil hai ek gunasutra ke ek bhaag kii kshati yaa vruddhi
 jinomik pravardhan tab hota he jab ek koshika ek chote gunasutri locas kii kai pratilipiyaan praapt kar leti he, saamanyatya isamen ek yaa adhik onkosin hote hai or asann anuvanshik saamagree hoti he
 Localization occurs when two different chromosomal regions, abnormally, converge at a specific location
 iskaa ek janaa mana udhaaharan he philadelphia gunasutra yaa gunasutra 9 or 22 kaa sthanikaran, jo teevr majja janit rakt cancer main hota he, iske parinamswaroop bcr-abl sanglan protein, ek onkogenic tyrosine kinage kaa utpaadan hota he
 Small-scale mutations include point mutations, decreases or increases, which can occur in the promoter of a gene, affecting its expression
 yaa jin ke anukram koden main ho sakati he or iske protein utpaada ke sthayitv yaa kriya ko roopantarit kar sakati he
 Disruption of the sole gene can result in the integration of genomic material from a DNA virus or retro virus, and this type of event can result in the expression of viral oncogenes in the affected cell and its progeny
 adhi-anuvaanshiki, DNA saranchana main rasinic, gaiyr utparivartaneey parivartanon ke madhyam se jin abhivyakti ke niyaman kaa adhyayan he
 The principle of over-genetics in cancer pathogenesis is that non-mutational changes in DNA cause changes in gene expression
 saamaanya rup se, onkosin shant hote hai, udhaaharan ke liye aisa DNA methilikaran ke kaaran hota he
 Damage in this methylation induces aberrant expression of oncogene, which is the cause of cancer pathogenesis
 adhi-anuvaanshik parivartan kii gyaat pranali main shaamil he diene methilikaran or gunasutra ke DNA par vishesh sthiti par jude hue histone protein kaa methilikaran yaa asitelikaran
 Classes of therapy known as HDAC inhibitors and DNA methyl transferase inhibitors may re-regulate over-genetic signaling in cancer cells
 onkosin kai prakaar se koshika vruddhi ko badhaava dete he
 Many hormones can be made, a chemical messenger between cells that induces mitotic division, the effect of which depends on signal transduction of receptor tissue or cells
 duusare shabdon main, jab ek praptakarta koshika par ek hormone grahi uttejit hota he, sanket koshika kii sataha se koshika ke kendrak ko sanvahit hota he, yah kendriya str par jin pratilekhan viniman main kuch parivartanon ko prabhavit karata he
 Some oncogenes themselves are part of the signal transit mechanism, or part of the signal receptor in cells and tissues, thus controlling the sensitivity of such hormones
 onkosin aksar samasutrajan utpann karte hai, yaa protein sanshleshan main DNA ke pratilekhan main sanlagn hote hai, jo protein or anzime banaata he, ye protein or anzime un utpaadon or jaev rasayanon ke nirmaan ke liye uttaradaayi hai, jinke saath koshikaayen antarkriya karti hai or jinka koshikaayen upyog karti hai
 Mutations in proto-oncogenes, which are generally the stable equivalents of oncogenes, can modify their expression and action, and the products increase the action or amount of the protein
 jab aisa hota he, aadya-onchogin onchogin ban jate hai or yah sankraman koshika main koshika chakra viniman ke saamaanya santulan ko bigaad detaa he, jisase aniyantrit koshika vruddhi sambhav ho jaati he
 Even if possible, the possibility of cancer cannot be reduced by removing proto-oncogenes from the genome, as they are complex for the growth, repair and establishment of the organism
 aisa keval tab hota he jab ve utparivartit ho jate hai or vruddhi ke sanket atyadhik ho jate hai
 One of the first oncogenes to be defined in cancer research is the Ras oncogene
 Mutations in the Ras family of protein-oncogenes are very common, occurring in 20% to 30% of all human lumps
 raas ko mul rup se harvey sarcoma virus jinom main pahachaanaa gaya tha or shodhakarta is baat se aashcharyachakit ho gaye ki na keval maanav jinom main yah jin upasthiti tha balki, ek utprerak niyantran tatv se judaa hua tha, jo koshika rekha sanvardhan main cancer ko prerit kar saktaa tha
 The knot suppressor gene encodes for anti-proliferation signals and proteins, which suppress mitosis and cell growth
 saamanytah, gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin pratilekhan kaarak hai jo koshikeey tanaav yaa DNA kshati ke dwaara sakriy hote hai
 Often DNA damage can result in the presence of free-radical genetic material as well as other symptoms that induce enzymes and pathways responsible for activation of knot-suppressing genes
 aise jeenon kaa kaary he DNA kii marammat ke liye koshika chakra ke aage badhane par niyantran, jo utparivartan ko putree koshika tak sthanantarit hone se roktaa he
 The p53 protein, one of the most studied knot suppressor genes, is a transcription factor that is activated by several cellular stressors, including hypoxia and ultraviolet radiation damage
 p53 roopantaran main shaamil sabhi canceron ke lagbhag aadhe ke alaava, iske gaanth ke shaman kaary ko bhalee prakaar se samajha nahin gaya he
 Apparently p53 has two functions: one a nuclear role as a transcription factor and the other a cytoplasmic role in regulating cell cycle, cell division and apoptosis
 warburg pariklpana ke anusaar cancer kii vruddhi ke liye urja hetu glycolysis kaa adhimaanya prayog hota he
 p53 regulates the transfer of the glycolytic tract from respiration
 haalanki, ek utparivartan, khud "ise band karte hue" gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin ko yaa is sanket maarg ko kshati pahunchaa saktaa he, jo ise sakriy karata he, is kaa achal parinaam he ki DNA kii marammat baadhit yaa sandamit ho jaati he: marammat rahit diene kshati kaa sangrah nishchit rup cancer kaa kaaran banataa he
 Mutations of the genes that suppress the knot that occur in the germ level cells are transferred to the progeny and increase the likelihood of cancer in subsequent generations
 in pariwaron ke sadasyon ne aisi ghatnaon main vruddhi kii he or isse bahul tumor kii vilambtaa main kami ai he
 The type of knot is typical for each type of mutation that suppresses the knot, with some mutations causing specific types of cancer, while other mutations causing other types of cancer
 utparivarti tumor shaamak kii vanshagati kaa prakaar yah he ki ek prabhavi sadsy ek doshapurn pratilipi ko ek janak se or saamaanya pratilipi ko duusare janak se praapt karata he
 For example, a person who inherits a mutant p53 allele may develop melanoma and pancreatic cancer called li-fraumeni syndrome
 anya vanshaagat gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin syndrome main shaamil he retino blostoma se sambandhit Rb utparivartan or adinopoliposis badi aant ke cancer se jude APC jin utparivartan

 Finally, hereditary mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 cause early onset of breast cancer
 1971 main yah prastaav diya gaya ki cancer kaa vikaas kam se kam do utparivartan ghatnaon par nirbhar karata he
 According to Knudson's two-injury hypothesis, a hereditary gene level mutation in a gene that is quenching a gene will cause cancer only if another mutation occurs later in the organism's life, it is the gene that suppresses that knot
 Will inactivate other alleles
 aamtaur par, onkosin prabhavi hote hai, kyonki unamem kriya-kaa-laabh utparivartan shaamil hota he, jabaki utparivartit tumor shaamak aprabhavi hote hai, kyonki unamem kriya-kii-haani utparivartan shaamil hota he
 Each cell has two copies of the same gene, each of which is obtained from the parent and in most cases an action-to-gain mutation in only one copy of a particular proto-oncogene, making that gene a true oncogene
 Is sufficient for duusari ore, kriya-kii-haani utparivartan kaa, gaanth kaa shaman karne vaale jin kii donon pratilipiyon main hona aavashyak he taaki jin ko puri tarah se kriyaaheen banaaya ja sake
 However, there are cases in which a mutated copy of the knot-suppressing gene neutralizes the other wild-type copy

 These initial tumor changes should be differentiated from overgrowth, which is a mutant increase in cell division due to an external stimulation, such as a hormonal imbalance or chronic irritation
 durvikasita ke sabase gambhir maamalon ko "swasthani karcarbud " kaha jaataa he
 In Latin, the word "in situ" means "in place", so the term carcinoma is in situ, the uncontrolled growth of cells that remain in their original place and have not shown any invasion of other tissues
 phir bhi, carcinoma swasthani ek aakraamak durdamata main viksit ho saktaa he or yadi sambhav ho to ise aam taur par shalya kriya ke dwaara hataa diya jaataa he
 Just as the growth occurs in animal populations, so does growth in uncontrolled populations of cells

 Different positions do not necessarily represent individual mutations
 For example, inactivation of a genus will cause codons for the p53 protein, genomic instability, apoptosis, and increased angiogenesis
 cancer kii sabhi koshikaayen vibhajit nahin hoti hai
 Rather, a sub-set of cells in a knot is called the cancerous stem cells, which replicate on their own and form differentiated cells

 dhumrapaan karne waalon main fefdon ke cancer ke liye siti scan-aadhaarit screening ke haal hi main kiye gaye adhyayan ke golmol parinaam saamne aaye hai, july 2007 se vyavasthit screening kii salaah nahin di jaati he
 Epidermic clinical trials of plain-film chest X-rays that screen for lung cancer in smokers have not proved to be beneficial for this approach
 canin cancer kii jaanch ke sateek parinaam hote hai, lekin yah abhi bhi anusandhan ke praarambhik charan main he
 Most cancers are either identified early by their symptoms and signs or appear during screening
 inamen se koi bhi nishchit nidaan nahin he, jise aam taur par ek rogavigyaani kii salaah kii zarurat hoti he, yah rog vigyaani ek prakaar kaa physician hona chahie jo cancer or anya rogon ke nidaan main maahir he
 Those who are suspected of cancer are examined by medical examination
 isamen saamaanya hai rakt pareekshan, eks kiran, siti scan or antahdarshan 
 Cancer can be suspected for a number of reasons, but the definitive diagnosis of most malignancies should be ensured by a pathologist through tissue scientific testing of cancer cells
 biopsy yaa shalya chikitsa ke dwaara utak ko praapt kiya ja saktaa he
 Many biopsies can be performed in a physician's office
 anya angon kii biopsy ek nishchetak kii upasthiti main kii jaati he, iske liye shalya chikitsa ke kaksh main shalya kriya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he
 The tissue diagnosis given by the pathologist explains the type of cell proliferating
 saath hi gaanth kii utak vaigyanik shrenee, anuvanshik asaamanyataon or anya lakshanon ko bhi spasht karte hai
 Also, this information is useful in evaluating the patient's prior diagnosis and choosing the best treatment
 koshika anuvanshiki or pratiraksha utak rasayan vigyaan pareekshan ke anya prakaar hai jo ek rog vigyaani ek utak ke namoonay par kar saktaa he
 These tests can provide information about the molecular changes that have taken place in the cancer cell and thus indicate the future behavior and best treatment of the cancer
 cancer kaa upachaar shalya chikitsa, rasochikitsa, vikiran chikitsa, pratiraksha chikitsa, monochlonal antibody chikitsa yaa anya vidhiyon ke dwaara kiya ja saktaa he
 The choice of therapy depends on the condition and range of the knot and the stage of the disease, as well as the general state of the patient
 Many experimental cancer treatments are also being developed
 sharir ko nuksaan pahuchaye bina cancer ko puri tarah se khatm karnaa upachaar kaa uddeshy hota he
 Sometimes this can be done surgically, but the tendency of the cancer to invade nearby tissue or spread to distant locations by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness
 chemotherapy kii prabhaavashiltaa aksar sharir main anya utakon ke vishikaran ke dwaara simit ho jaati he
 Radiation can also damage normal tissues
 kyonki "cancer" kaa sandarbh rogon ke ek varg se he, aisa sambhav nahin he ki "cancer kaa hameshaa ek maatr upachaar" hi rahegaa, phir bhi sabhi sankramak rogon ke liye ek hi upachaar hota he
 Theoretically, non-hematological cancer can be treated if it is completely removed by surgery, but this is not always possible
 jab cancer shalya chikitsa se pehle hi metastasis ke dwaara sharir ke anya angon tak pahunch jaataa he, tab puri tarah se shalya kriya dwaara ise hataa dena aam taur par asambhav hota he
 In the halted sample of cancer progression, the knot grows spatially, then spreads to the lymph nodes, and then to all other parts of the body
 For this reason, the popularity of endemic treatments such as surgery for small cancers has increased
 yahan tak ki chote sthaniyakrut tumor main bhi metastasis kii bahut adhik kshamta hoti he
 Examples of surgical procedures for cancer include - breast amputation for breast cancer and prostate-piercing for prostate cancer
 The goal of surgery is to either remove the knot or remove the entire organ
 a cancer cell is invisible to the naked eye, but can then grow into a new knot, a process known as recurrence
 is kaaran ke liye, rogavigyaani shalya kriya se nikaale gaye namoonay kii jaanch karte hai, yadi swasth utak kii seemaa upasthit he, to is baat kii sambhaavna kam ho jaati he ki sookshm cancer kii koshikayen rogi ke sharir main rah gai hai
 In addition to the removal of the primary knot, surgery is often required for stage determination eg determining the extent of the disease and determining whether it has reached the regional lymph nodes via metastasis
 avasthaa nirdhaaran purv nidaan kaa mukhya nirdharak he or sahyogi chikitsa kii aavashyaktaa bhi he
 Often, surgery is necessary to control symptoms such as spinal cord compression or bowel obstruction
 ise shaman upachaar ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Radiation therapy uses ionizing radiation to destroy cancer cells and compressed lumps
 vikiran chikitsa ko bahya kiran radiotherapy ke dwaara baahar se hi niyantrit kiya jaataa he yaa brekitherapy ke dwaara andar se niyantrit kiya ja saktaa he
 The effect of radiation therapy is localized and limited to the area to be treated
 vikiran chikitsa, ilaaj kiye jane vaale kshetra kii koshikaon ko kshatigrast karti he yaa nasht kar detii he, is kriya main in koshikaon ke anuvanshik padaarth ko nasht kar diya jaataa he taaki koshikaon main aage vibhaajan or vruddhi na ho paae
yadhyapi vikiran cancer kii koshikaon or saamaanya koshikaon donon ko nasht kar dete hai, adhikansh saamaanya koshikaayen vikiran ke prabhaav se ubar aati hai or thik prakaar se kaary karne lagati hai
 The goal of radiation therapy is to destroy as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting damage to nearby healthy tissue
 isliye, yah kai bhaagon main di jaati he jisase bich kii avadhi main swasth utakon ko thik hone kaa mauka mil jaataa he
 Radiation therapy can be used to treat almost every type of solid lump, including cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, abdomen, uterus, or soft tissue sarcoma
 
 leukemia or limphoma ke upachaar main bhi vikiran chikitsa kaa upyog kiya ja saktaa he
 The radiation dose for each site depends on many factors, these factors are, the radio sensitivity of each type of cancer and whether the surrounding tissue or organs can be destroyed by radiation
 is prakaar, har prakaar ke upachaar main, vikiran chikitsa iske parshv dushprabhavon ke bina nahin he
 Cancer treatment of cancer is done in medicines which can destroy cancer cells
 vartmaan upyog main, shabd "rasochikitsa" kaa upyog un cytotoxic yaa koshikavishi dawaaon ke liye kiya jaataa he jo lakshith chikitsa ke vipareet, saamaanya rup main tezi se vibhajit hoti hui koshikaon ko prabhavit karti hai
 
 Rheumatic drugs inhibit cell division in various possible ways, for example by replication of DNA or segregation of newly formed chromosomes
 Most forms of chemotherapy target all cells that rapidly divide, specific only to cancer cells
 Are not, although some specificity is due to the fact that most cancer cells are not capable of repairing DNA damage
 Whereas normal cells typically have these abilities
 atah, rasochikitsa main swasth utakon ko nuksaan pahunchane kii kshamta hoti he, vishesh rup se ve utak jinamein ucch pratisthaapan dar hoti he 
ye koshikaayen aamtaur par rasochikitsa ke baad apni marammat kar leti hai
 Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are given at the same time
 ise "sangyojan rasochikitsa" kaha jaataa he; adhikansh rasochikitsa regimen ek sangyojan main hi die jate hai
 Treatment of some types of leukemia and lymphoma requires high doses of chemotherapy or whole body decompression
 yah upachaar asthi majja ko alag kar detaa he or isliye sharir kii thik hone or rakt ke punarniman kii kshamta pruthakkrut ho jaati he
 For this reason, bone marrow, or peripheral blood column cell harvesting is performed before the ablation effect of therapy so that "rescue" is possible after treatment
 ise autologus stem koshika pratyaropan ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 Alternatively, hematopoietic stem cells taken from a matched unrelated donor can be transplanted
 lakshith therapy jo 1990 ke dashak ke ant main sabase pehle uplabdh hui, kaa kai prakaar ke cancer ke upachaar main mukhya prabhaav tha or vartmaan main yah ek bahut hi adhik sakriy anusandhan kshetra he
 This includes the use of factors that are specialized to unregulate the proteins of cancer cells
 chote anu lakshith upachaar dawaayein aamtaur par cancer koshikaon ke bheetar utparivartit, ati abhivyakt, yaa anya jatil proteinon par anzymetic domen kii sandamak hoti hai
 Major examples are the thyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib and zefitinib
 monochlonal pratirakshi chikitsa ek anya ranneeti he jisamen upachaar kaa kaarak ek pratirakshi hota he jo cancer koshikaon kii sataha par ek protein ke saath vishesh rup se bandha bana letaa he
 Examples include anti-her2 / neu antibody trastuzumeb used in breast cancer and anti-cd-20 antibody rituximeb used in many types of B-cell malignancies
 lakshith therapy main "homing yukti" ke rup main chote peptid bhi shaamil ho sakate hai, jo gaanth ke chaaron ore prabhavit bahya koshiki matrix ke saath yaa koshika kii sataha par grahi ke saath baandh bana sakate hai
 Radio nuclides that are attached to these peptides eventually kill the cancer cell if the nucleus is decomposing around the cell
 vishesh rup se in bandhit padaarthon ke oligo- yaa multimers bahut mahatvapurn hote hai, chunki ve gaanth kii vishistataa or uthkanthaa ko badhaate hai
 Photodynamic therapy is a triple treatment for cancer that includes photosensitizers, tissue oxygen, and light
 PDT kaa upyog aadhari koshika carcinoma yaa fefdon ke cancer ke upachaar ke liye kiya jaataa he; PDT bade tumor ko shalya chikitsa ke dwaara hataa die jane ke baad durdam utak ke bache hue avasheshon ko hataane main bhi upyogi ho saktaa he
 Cancer immune therapy is a group of different medical strategies designed to induce a patient's own immune system to fight the knot
 gaanth ke khilaaf pratirakshi pratikriya utpann karne ke liye kai vidhiyaan hai, ye hai, satahi mutrashi cancer ke liye antar dhaneey BCG pratiraksha chikitsa, tathaa vrikk koshika carcinoma or melanoma ke rogiyon main pratirakshi pratikriya prerit karne ke liye interferon or anya cytokine kaa upyog
 kai prakaar kii ganthon, khaas taur par durdam melanoma or vrikk koshika carcinoma, ke liye vishisht pratiraksha pratikriya utpann karne ke liye vexinon par gahan anusandhan kiya ja rahaa he
 cephalucal-t is a vaccine-like strategy used in modern clinical trials for prostate cancer, in which thrushmash cells taken from the patient are loaded with prostatic acid phosphatase peptides to induce a specific immune response against prostate-derived cells
 To be
 elloginenic hemetopoctic stem koshika pratyaropan ko pratiraksha therapy kaa ek rup mana ja saktaa he, kyonki daata kii pratiraksha koshikaayen grapht-banaam-gaanth prabhaav ke tahat gaanth par aksar akraman karti hai
 Therefore, allogeneic HSCT causes higher rates of treatment than autologous transplants for many types of cancer, although side effects are also more severe
 kuch cancer kii vruddhi ko vishesh hormonon ko uplabdh kara kar yaa avaruddh karke sandamit kiya ja saktaa he
 Some common examples of hormone sensory lumps are - specific types of breast and prostate cancer
 Removing or blocking estrogen or testosterone is often an important additional treatment
 vishesh prakaar ke canceron main, hormone kaa prashasan shithil ho jaataa he, jaise projestogen chikitsa kii drushti se laabhakaari ho saktaa he
 Angiogenesis that is required for the tumor to survive
 kuch, jaise bevasizumeb, ko manyata de di gayi he or chikitsakeey upyog main inkaa upyog kiya ja rahaa he
 a main problem with anti-angiogenesis drugs is that many factors stimulate the growth of blood vessels in normal and cancerous cells
 angiogenesis virdohi dawaaye keval ek hi kaarak ko lakshya banaati hai, isliye anya kaarak rakt vahini kii vruddhi ko uttejit karnaa jari rakhte hai
 Other problems include route of administration, maintenance of stability and action and targeting on tumor vasculature
 yadhyapi cancer ke lakshanon par niyantran ko cancer kaa upachaar nahin mana ja saktaa he, yah cancer rogiyon kii jivan kii gunvattta kaa ek mahatvapurn nirdharak he or is faisle main mukhya bhoomika nibhaataa he ki rogi anya upachaar ke liye sakasham he yaa nahin
 Although doctors have the therapeutic skills to reduce pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, and other common problems in cancer patients, this group of patients responds to the needs of symptom control in a multi-disciplinary manner of palliative care
 Specialty has evolved
 dard kii dawaaye, jaise ki morphine or oxicodon or michali or ulti ko rokane ke liye antiemetics dawaaen, cancer se sambandhit lakshanon se yukt rogiyon main aam taur par kaam main lee jaati hai
 Sophisticated antiemetics such as ondansetron and analogues, as well as aprapitant, have made radical treatment more likely in cancer patients
 cancer ke kaaran purana dard hameshaa satat utak kshati ke kaaran hota he jo rog yaa upachaar prakriya se sambandhit he yadhyapi paryaavarniya karkon or dard ke vyavhaar ke utpaadan main prabhavi gadbadi kii bhi bhoomika hoti he, cancer ke dard se yukt rogiyon main aam taur par pramukh ityologic kaaran nahin hote hai
 Furthermore, most patients with severe cancer-related pain are in the late stages of their lives and need palliative therapy
 mudde jaise nashile padaarthon ke upyog kaa saamaajik kalank, kaam or kaaryaatmak sthiti or swasthya dekhbhaal, samgr maamle ke prabandhan main adhik mahatvapurn nahin hai
 Therefore, the specific strategy for cancer pain management is to try to get maximum comfort to the patient by the use of narcotics and other drugs, surgical and physical methods
 doctor cancer ke antim sthiti ke rogiyon main dard ke liye maadak padaarthon kaa upyog nahin karnaa chaahate hai kyon ki isse unhen isaki lat ho sakati he yaa unki shwaas kriya main baadha aa sakati he
 Palliative care is a new branch of the care movement that provides more comprehensive support in the treatment of pain in cancer patients
 thakaan cancer rogiyon ke liye ek bahut hi aam samasya he or haal hi main cancer chikitsa vigyaniyon ke liye iskaa upachaar bahut mahatvapurn ban gaya he, yadhyapi yah kai rogiyon main jivan kii gunvattta ko lekar mahatvapurn bhoomika nibhaataa he
 Clinical trials, also called research studies, also test new treatments in cancer patients
 is shodh kaa lakshya he cancer ke ilaaj ke liye behatar tareeke khojna or cancer rogiyon kii madad karnaa
 Clinical trials test a range of therapies such as new drugs, new approaches to surgery or radiation therapy, new combinations of treatments, or new methods such as gene therapy
 ek naidanik pareekshan, ek lambi or satark cancer anusandhan kii prakriya ke antim charnon main se ek he
 The search for new treatments begins in the laboratory, where scientists first test and develop new ideas
 agar ek drushtikon upyogi prathit hota he to aglaa kadam hota he iskaa jaanavar par pareekshan, jo yah bataata he ki cancer rogi par iskaa kya prabhaav hoga or iske koi hanikaarak prabhaav hai yaa nahin
 Of course, many treatments that work well in the laboratory or in animals do not always prove effective in humans
 upyogi maane jane vaale upachaar surakshit or prabhavi hai yaa nahin, iskaa pataa lagane ke liye cancer ke rogiyon main adhyayan kiye jate hai
 It may be that the patient participating in this treatment will personally get help from this treatment
 ve cancer visheshgyon se aadhuniktam suraksha praapt karte hai or ve yaa to jaanch kiya ja rahaa nayaa ilaaj praapt karte hai yaa cancer ke liye sarvottam uplabdh maanak upachaar praapt karte hai
 Also, new treatments may carry unknown risks, but if new treatments prove effective or more effective than standard treatments, the patient studied becomes the first person to receive its benefit
 is baat kii koi guarantee nahin he ki pareekshan kiya jane vaala nayaa upachaar yaa ek maanak upachaar achche parinaam degaa
 In children with cancer, a survey showed that children who underwent such testing did not, on average, see better or worse outcomes than standard treatments; This ensures that the success or failure of any experimental treatment cannot be predicted
 poorak or vaikalpik chikitsa upachaar, chikitsa, swasthya raksha pranaaliyon, prathaon or utpaadon ke vividh samooh hai, jo parmparik chikitsa ke bhaag nahin hai
 "complementary medicine" refers to the methods and substances used in conjunction with traditional medicine
 jabaki "vaikalpik chikitsa" kaa arth un yogicon se he jinka upyog parmparik chikitsa ke sthaan par kiya jaataa he
 The use of CAM is common in people with cancer; a study conducted in 2000 found that 69% of cancer patients used at least one CAM therapy as part of their cancer treatment
 cancer ke liye zyaadaatar poorak or vaikalpik chikitsaaon kaa kathor adhyayan yaa pareekshan nahin kiya gaya he
 Some alternative treatments, which have been investigated and are ineffective, are being marketed and encouraged
 garbhvatee maataaon kii badhati hui umr ke kaaran garbhavastha ke dauraan samavarti cancer kii ghatnaon main vruddhi hui he, in ghatnaon main vruddhi kaa ek or kaaran he janm purv ultrasound pareekshanon ke dauraan praasangik rup se mata main gaanth kii jaanch
 Cancer treatment needs to be selected for the least harm to both the mother and her fetus / child

 There are usually no questions on radiation therapy, and there is always a risk of miscarriage and congenital malformations in chemotherapy
 bachche par chikitsa ke prabhaavon ke bare main bahut kam gyaat he
 Even a drug that has been tested that it does not reach the baby through the placenta, some forms of cancer can damage the placenta and the drug goes through it
 twachaa cancer ke kuch rup metastasis ke dwaara bachche ke sharir main bhi pravesh kar sakate hai
 Diagnosis has also become more difficult, since computed tomography is infeasible because of its high radiation dose
 phir bhi, chumbakeey anunaad imaging saamaanya rup se kaam karata he
 However the opposite media cannot be used, as they cross the placenta
 garbhavastha ke dauraan cancer ke thik prakaar se nidaan or upachaar main aane vaali kathinaaiyon ke ek parinaam ke rup main, vaikalpik tareekon kaa istamaal kiya jaataa he, isamen yaa to adhik ugr cancer upachaar shuru karne ke liye ek sijerian section kaa upyog kiya jaataa he yaa yadi cancer itnaa adhik durdam ho chukaa he ki maa ke ilaaj main or deree nahin kii ja sakati he to cancer kaa upachaar karne ke liye garbhpaat kar diya jaataa he
 Sometimes, the fetal nodes are diagnosed while staying in the uterus

 islamic dharamshastra main imaan islamic dharamshastra ke aadhyatmik pahaluon main ek aastik vishwaas ko darshata he
 The simplest definition of this is the belief in the six articles of faith, known as "araqan al-iman"
 iskaa arth islam ke chah vishwaas ke vishyon main aasthaa rakhana he
 The word Iman is depicted in both the Quran and hadith-e-jibril
 quran ke mutabik, imaan ko dharmik karmon ke saath hona chahie or swarg main pravesh ke liye donon ek saath jaruri hai
 In Jibril's Hadith, the dimensions of Islamic religion form the three "islam", "ihsan" and "iman"
 islam ke bheetar or baahar, dharm main vishwaas or hetu kii charchaa hoti he, or donon ke saapeksh mahatv ko bhulaayaa nahin jaasakata
 Many scholars argue that both originate from a single source and place for trust and reason, so both should be harmonious
 arabi main, imaan, uccharan kaa arth he " vishwaas "
 This verb is a noun, آمن, meaning to believe in something
 haddees main mohammad sahib ne "imaan kaa matlab - dil main gyaan, jeebh par awaz, or haath pair main gatividhi" ke rup main paribhaashit kiya
 Faith is a belief in the truth that is real
 jab logon ko vishwaas hota he, to ve khud ko us satya se jod dete hai
 Knowing the truth is not enough, the heart must accept it, it must be expressed by the tongue, which is an expression of wisdom and in the end it is necessary to execute it to reflect their confidence
 hamiduddin faraahi, apane tafseer main imaan ke arth kii vyakhya karte hue, likhaa he: Faith is generally outlined using six articles of faith: inamen se pehle quran or mohammad dwaara pehle paanch kaa ullekh kiya gaya he, jabaki allaah main vishwaas kii ek siddhant shaamil he - bhagwaan dwaara aadeshit bhagya ke achche or bure - ne sabhi chah ko nimnlikhit tareeke se sanderbhit kiya he gabrial ke haddees main: There is another similar description from Muhammad as well: " ebn abbaas ne varnan kiya ki malak jibril ne ek baar paigambar se poocha: "mujhe bataao imaan kya he?" paigambar ne uttar diya: "imaan he vishvas karnaa allaah par, nyaay ke din par, uske malaika par, kitaaben or paigambaron, or mrityu ke baad jivan main vishwaas karnaa he, or swarg or narak main vishwaas karnaa or mizaan kii sthapana par jo hamaare karm ko tolane ke liye he, or taqadir main vishwaas karnaa, iske achche or bure par
 Jibril then asked him: "if i do all this, will i stay with Iman?" The Prophet said: "when you have done all this, you will be in Imaan
 " It is also believed that the essential imaan consists of the first 3 things
 quran main, 10 gunon main se ek gun imaan he jo kisi ko allaah kii dayaa or inaam praptakarta banane ke kaaran miltaa he
 The Quran states that faith can increase with remembrance of Allah
 quran yah bhi kahata he ki is duniya main momin ke liye ati priy chiz vishwaas ke ilaava kuch bhi nahin hona chahie
 Muhammad has said that; He attained the sweetness of faith which led Allah to accept Islam as religion and Muhammad as Prophet
 unhone yah bhi kaha ki jab tak vah apane bacchon, mata-pita or rishtedaaron se zyada paigambar se pyaar nahin karata tab tak koi bhi sachcha aastik nahin ho saktaa
 In another example, he remarks that it is only after falling in love with Allah and Muhammad that a person can become aware of the true taste of faith
 quran ke ek mufassiron amin ahsaan islahi ne is prem kii prakruti arth ko spasht kiya he: 

prem does not merely imply inherently passionate love for one's wife, children and other relatives, but it also refers to love based on certain attitudes and wisdom and principles
 is prem ke kaaran hi ek vyakti, jivan ke har kshetra main, is drushtikon or siddhant ko praathamikta detaa he
 If a man grapples with the demands of his wife, children, and relatives with this approach, he follows it without hesitation, due to this sincere love for the wishes of his wife and children and the demands of his family and clan
 Does
 islahi or maududi donon ne anumaan lagaaya he ki adhyay 14 main ek achche shabd or bure shabd kii quran kii tulana vastav main vishwaas or avishvaas kii tulana he
 Thus, the Quran is effectively comparing faith to a tree whose roots lie deep in the soil and branches spread across the vastness of the sky
 imaan mohammad dwaara allaah se kii gai ek prarthana kaa vishay bhi he: Oh allah! i have rejected myself and handed myself over to you, and i have recognized your magnification and first come to your shelter, running away from you is not going to get anywhere
 agar kahin hai to aapke saath he
 Lord! i have believed in your book which you have revealed and believe in the Prophet whom you have sent as Prophet
 imam al-behaqi apni kitaab shub al-imaan main sankalit kiya he ki vishwaas kii 77 shakhaaen he
 In it, he has explained the essential qualities of faith, mentioning the Quranic imports and the hadiths of the prophet, which reflect the faith
 nimnlikhit haddees mohammad sahib par aadhaarit he: Abu Huraira narrated that the Prophet said: “iman has more than 70 branches
 in shakhaon main sabase utkrisht" laa elaha illallaah " padhanaa he, or sabase choti shakha raste main padhi baadha ko dur karnaa he
 And Haya is an important branch of Imaan
 " In Islam, it is necessary that harmony and coordination exist between faith and deeds
 faraahi ne is pahalu ko apane tafaseer main nimnlikhit tareeke se samajhaayaa he: Religious deeds are mentioned in the Quran after faith


 In the case of faith, the need for its interpretation is clear: the place of faith is heart and intelligence
 buddhi or dil ke maamalon main, na keval ek vyakti dusron ko dhokhaa de saktaa he balki kabhi-kabhi vah khud dhokhe main rah saktaa he
 He considers himself a Moomin when in fact he is not
 is kaaran se, iske liye do sakshya kii aavashyaktaa hoti he: ek vyakti ke shabd or vyakti ke karm
 Since words can be untrue, a person who claims faith only through words is not considered as a Mu'man and it was considered necessary that a person's deeds also bear witness to his faith
 is prakaar quran ne kaha : he aap jeebh se vishwaas karte hai! apane karmon ke madhyam se vishwaas karo
 The relationship between logic and belief in Islam is a complex debate spanning centuries
 ismail raji al-faaruqi is vishay par bataate hai: non-muslims may oppose the principles of Islam
 haalanki, unhen pataa hona chahie ki islam apane siddhanton ko vishesh rup se vishpasht rup se nahin pesh karata he, jo vishwaas karte hai yaa vishwaas karnaa chaahate hai vah kar sakate hai
 Islam offers this logically, rationally
 yah hamaare paas taarkik or susangat tarkon ke saath aavashyak aadhaaron ke saath pesh karata he
 It is not lawful for us to disagree on the basis of personal taste, or subjective experience
 2118 isa purv isa messiah ke janm se purv ke varshon ko darshata he
 The year 2121 BC or the year before his birth is represented as the basis of the birth of Jesus
 yah julian kalendar par adhaarit ek samuhik varsh mana jaataa he

 bharat main iske alaava kai panchag prasiddh he jaise vikram samvath jo isa ke janm se 57 yaa 58 varsh purv shuru hoti he
 Apart from this Shak Shanvant is also famous
