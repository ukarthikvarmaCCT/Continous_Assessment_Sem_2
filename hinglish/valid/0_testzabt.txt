 Take a look again at that point
 It is our home


 our land
 Every person you love, whom you know, whom you have heard of, who ever was born, spent his entire life at this point
 All our joys and sorrows, thousands of religions and beliefs, every hunter, brave and coward, every king and farmer, every young couple in love, every mother and father, every child and scientist full of expectations, every teacher, every teacher Corrupt leaders, every 'superstar', every saint and sinner in our history lived there - on that particle of dust floating in a ray of sun
 is vishaal brahmand main hamaari prithvi ek bahut hi choti jagah he
 anginat insaanon kii un hatyaon ke bare main socho jo un senapatiyon or shahanshahon ne kii, taaki apni shaan or jeet main ve is bindu ke kisi chote se hisse ke kuch palon ke liye maalik ban saken
 un anginat atyaacharon ke bare main socho jo is bindu ke ek kone main rahane vaale logon ne kisi duusare kone par rah rahe apane hi jaise logon par kiye
 hamaari kitni galatchhemiyaan hai, ek duusare ko maar daalane kaa kitna utavlaapan he, duusare insaanon ke prati kitni nafrat he! We dupes humans, our pride, our illusion that we have a special place in the entire universe, this dull light point challenges all these things
 Our planet is a small lonely spot in this dense darkness of the universe
 In this vastness of the universe, there is no indication that someone will come from another planet to save our world from our evils
 abhi tak gyaat grahon main keval prithvi hi he jisamen jivan he
 aisi duusari koi jagah nahin he jahaan nikat bhavishya main ham rah saken
 shaayad ham duusare grahon ko dekhne ja paaen
 par vahaan basna philhal hamaari pahunch se bahut dur he
 hamen acha lage yaa na lage, par abhi ke liye keval prithvi hi vah jagah he jahaan ham rah sakate hai
 It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and a better human experience
 There is hardly any other evidence better than this picture of this small world of our vanity
 It reminds me of the responsibility to be more kind to each other, and also to save and cherish this blurred blue spot, which is our only home
 – karl segan, khagolvaigyanik Carl Segan was three times married
 In 1957, he married biologist Lynn Margulis
 The couple had two children, Jeremy and Dorian Sagan
 karl sigan or margulis ke talaak ke baad, unhone 1 9 68 main kalakaar linda salzaman se vivaah kiya or unke paas ek baccha bhi tha, nik sagan in vivaahon ke dauraan, karl saagan ne apane kariyar par bahut jor diya, ek kaarak jisane saagan ke pehle talaak main yogadan diya ho
 In 1981, Sagan married Ann Drewian and later had two children, Alexandra and Samuel Sagan
 karl sigan or drunayan 1996 main apni mrityu tak shaadi kar chuke hai
 He lived in Ithaca in an Egyptian resurrected house on the edge of a cliff that was formerly the headquarters of the Cornell Secret Society
 ishak asimov ne keval do logon main segan ko ek ke rup main bataaya, jinaki budhimata apane aap ko paar kar gai thi
 The second, he claimed, was computer scientist and artificial intelligence expert Marvin Minsky
 saagan ne dharm or vigyaan ke bich dharm or sambandh ke bare main praayah baar baar likhaa he, jo ki bhagwaan kii paaramparik avadharana ke bare main apane andeh vyakt karte hai, jo ki ek shreshth vyakti he
 for example: kuch logon kaa maananaa he ki bhagwaan ek chaunkaa safed dadhi vaala ek halkaa-chamade vaala purush he, jahaan kahin bhi ek singhaasana par akaash main baithe hue hai, har chimney ke patan ke saath milakar kaam karte hai
 Others — for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein — believe that God is basically the total amount of physical laws that describe the universe
 maanavpatiyon ke kuch chhipe hue khagoleey bindu se manushya ke bhagya ko niyantrit karne vaale manavputra kulapati ke liye koi sammohak sakshya nahin hai, lekin bhautik kanoonon ke astitv se inkaar karne main paagalpan hoga
 In another account of his idea of the concept of God, Sagan emphatically wrote: yah vichaar he ki bhagwaan ek behate hue dadhi ke saath ek vishaal safed nar he jo akaash main baithta he or har spairo ke patan ke str ko kam karata he yah ajeeb he parantu yadi ishwar ek hi bhautik kanoonon kaa matlab he jo brahmad ko niyantrit karata he, to spasht rup se aisa ek parameshwar he yah bhagwaan bhaavnaatmak rup se santoshjanak he 


 yah gurutvkarshan ke kanoon se prarthana karne ke liye zyada myne nahin rakhata he
 On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: ek naastik koi aisa vyakti he jo nishchit he ki bhagwaan astitv main nahin hai, koi vyakti jo ishwar ke astitv ke khilaaf majaburi saboot he mujhe koi aisi majaburi saboot nahin pataa he kyonki bhagwaan ko dur-samay or jagahon or antim kaarnon par le jaaya ja saktaa he, hamen is baat kii pushti karne ke liye brahmad ke bare main bahut kuch pataa hona chahie ki aisa koi bhagwaan maujuud nahin he
 Something about the existence of God and being something of the existence of God, i seem to have faith extremes in a subject with doubt and uncertainty as to actually inspire very little confidence 1996 main unke dharmik vishwaason ke bare main ek sawaal ke jawaab main, sagon ne jawaab diya, "main agyeyavaadee hum
 "sagan said that it was difficult to prove or falsify the idea of god, the creator of the universe, and that the only scientific scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinite universe
 dharm par sagon ke vichaaron ko spinoja ke devtaa main oinstin ke vishwaas ke samaan tuchh samanta ke ek rup ke rup main vyakhya kiya gaya he
 His son, Dorian Sagan, said, "my father believed that the gods of Spinoza and Einstein, God is not behind nature, but nature
" " unki antim patni, en dryuyan ne kaha: When my husband died, because he was very famous and not known for being a believer, many people would come to me — sometimes it does — and ask me if Carl finally changed and Later changed to a belief
 ve mujhe aksar poochhate hai ki kya mujhe lagata he ki main use phir se dekhuunga
 Carl mustered the courage to face his death and never sheltered in confusion
 traasadee yah thi ki ham jaanate the ki ham ek-duusare ko phir kabhi nahin dekhenge
 i never hope to be with Carl again

 koran, quran yaa koran islam kii pavithratam kitaab he or isaki neenv he
 Muslims believe that it was narrated by Allah, the angel Jibril to Hazrat Muhammad
 musalmaan maanate hai ki koran hi allaah kii bheji antim or sarvocch kitaab he
 This book originated about 1400 years ago
 islam kii manyataon ke mutabiq koran allaah ke farishte jibril dwaara hazarat mohammad ko san 610 se san 632 main unki maut tak kulasa kiya gaya tha
 Although initially spread orally, it was first written in 633 after the death of Prophet Muhammad, and in 653 it was standardized and distributed to the Islamic Empire
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki ishwar dwaara bheje gaye pavitra sandeshon ke sabase aakiri sandesh koran main likhe gaye hai
 These messages originated with Adam
 hazarat aadam islamic manyataon main sabase pehla nabi tha or isaki tulana hindu dharm ke manu se ek had tak kii ja sakati he
 Just as the children of Manu have been called human in Hinduism, similarly the children of Adam in Islam are called man
 tauhid, dharmik aadesh, jananath, jahannam, sabar, dharm parayanata ke vishay aise hai jo baarambaar dohraye gaye
 In his time, the Quran was a straightforward, noble business man who was living a rich life in his family
 vishwa kii do mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh khadaa kar diya
 Not only this, he has made the illiterate people of the desert so civilized that even after hundreds of years, the mark of this civilization on the whole world gives its mark
 koran ne yudhd, shanti, rajya sanchaalan ibaadat, parivaar ke ve adarsh prastut kiye jiskaa maanav samaaj main aaj prabhaav he
 According to Muslims, the knowledge given in the Quran proves that Hazrat Muhammad is an Islamic prophet
 "koran" shabd kaa pehla zikr khud koran main hi miltaa he jahaan iskaa arth he - usne padhaa, yaa usne uchaara
 The word takes its Syrian parallel Kuriana meaning reading texts
 hanlanki paashchaatya jaankaar isko syrian shabd se jodate hai, adhikansh musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki iskaa mul kura shabd hi he
 But whatever it was at the time of Hazrat Muhammad's birthday it became an Arabic word
 khud koran main is shabd kaa koi 70 baar zikr hua he
 Apart from this, the Qur'an also has many names
 ise al furqaan, al hikmah, dhikr / zikr or mashhaf jaise naamon se bhi sambodhit kiya gaya he
 In the Qur'an, Allah has mentioned 25 Ambiya
 quran shabd quran main lagbhag 70 baar prakat hota he, jo vibhinn arthon ko maanata he
 It is a verbal noun of the Arabic verb qara, meaning "he reads"
 siriek samatuly qarayana he, jo "shaastra padhane" yaa "sabak" ko sanderbhit karata he
 While some Western scholars consider the term to be derived from the Syriac, a majority of Muslim officials consider the word to have originated
 bhale hi, yah mohammad ke jeevankaal main arabi shabd ban gaya tha
 An important meaning of the word is "the work of the text", as indicated in the early Qur'anic passage: "it is for us to gather it and read it
 anya chhandon main, shabd "ek vyaktigat maarg " ko sanderbhit karata he
 This is done in many ways in many contexts
 udhaaharan ke taur par: "jab al-quran padhaa jaataa he, to ise sunen or chup rahen
 "can also assume the meanings described with texts from other religions such as the Torah and the Gospel
 is shabd main samanaarthi samanaarthi shabd bhi hai jo puure quran main niojit hai
 Each synonym has its own different meaning, but its use can be found with the Quran in some contexts
 is tarah ke shabdon main kitaab, aayah ; or sura shaamil hai
 The latter two terms also denote units of publication
 sandarbhon ke bade bahumat main, aamtaur par ek nishchit lekh ke saath, shabd ko "prakaashan" ke rup main janaa jaataa he, jise antaraal par "bheja gaya" diya gaya he
 Other related words are: dhikr, referring to the Quran in the sense of a reminder and warning, and hikmah, sometimes referring to revelation or part of it
 quran khud ko "samajhadaari", "grantho kii maan", "guide", "gyaan", "yaad" ke rup main varnit karata he
 And "revelation"
 ek or shabd al-kitaab he, haalanki yah anya shastron, jaise torah or bible ke liye arabi bhashaa main bhi prayog kiya jaataa he
 The term Mushaf is often used to refer to particular Quranic scripts but is also used to identify earlier books in the Quran
 islamic parampara se sambandhit he ki mohammad ne pahaado par hira kii gupha main apni ibaadat ke dauraan apana pehla prakaashan praapt kiya tha
 Subsequently, he received the revelation of the complete Qur'an over a period of 23 years
 haddees or muslim itihaas ke mutabik, mohammad madina main aakar ek swatantra muslim samudaay kaa gathan karne ke baad, unhone apane kai saathi quran ko padhane or kanoonon ko seekhney or sikhaane kaa aadesh diya, jinhen dainik bataaya gaya tha
 It is related that some Quraysh who were taken as prisoners in the Battle of Badr regained their independence after having taught some Muslims the simple writings of the time
 is prakaar musalamaanon kaa ek samooh dhire-dhire sakshar ban gaya
 As it was said initially, the Quran was recorded on planks, skins, bones, and wooden stems
 musalamaanon ke bich zyaadaatar sure upyog main the kyonki sunni or shiya donon sroton dwaara kai hadison or itihaas main unka ullekh kiya gaya he, mohammad ke islam ke aahvaan ke rup main quran ke upyog se sambandhit, prarthana karne or padhane ke tareeke ke rup main
 However, the Quran was not present in book form in 632 at the time of Muhammad's death
 vidwaanon ke bich ek samjhauta he ki mohammad ne khud ko rahasyodghatan nahin likhaa tha
 Sahih al-bukhari narrates the revelation to Muhammad in the hadith, "sometimes it is like ringing a bell" and Aisha said, "I saw the Prophet being inspired by him on a very cold day and with his forehead
 Was sweating
 jaise hi vahi kii prerana khatm ho jaati to unki bechaini dur hojaati
 "muhammad's first revelation, according to the Quran, was with a vision
 prakaashan ke madhyam "ek shaktishaalee" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he, vah vyakti jo "sabase upar kshitij par tha jab dekhne ke liye spasht hua
 Then he came close and started talking to Muhammad
 " islamic adhyayan vidwaan velch vishwakosh main bataate hai ki unka maananaa he ki in kshanon par mohammad kii haalat or vivaranon ko vaastavik mana ja saktaa he, kyonki in rahasyodghatano ke baad unhen gambhir rup se pareshaan kiya gaya tha
 According to Welch, people around him must have witnessed these visits to the superhuman origins of Muhammad's inspirations
 haalanki, mohammad ke aalochakon ne unhen ek vyakti, ek kavi yaa jaadugar hone kaa aarope lagaaya kyonki unke anubhav pracheen arab main aise aankadon dwaara daawa kiye gaye logon ke samaan the
 Welch additionally states that it is uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial prophetic claim
 quran mohammad ko "ummi" ke rup main varnit karata he, jise paramparaagat rup se "ashikshit" ke rup main vyakhya kiya jaataa he, lekin iskaa arth adhik jatil he
 Medieval commentators such as al-tabri stated that the word inspired two meanings: first, the inability to read or write in general; Second, inexperience or ignorance of previous books or texts
 mohammad kii nirakshartaa ko unki bhavishyavaanee kii vaastaviktaa ke sanket ke rup main liya gaya tha
 For example, according to Fakhruddin al-razi, if Muhammad had mastered writing and reading, he might have been suspected of studying the books of the ancients
 wat jaise kuch vidwaan "ummi" kaa doosraa arth pasand karte hai - ve ise pehle pavitra granthon ke saath aparichitata ko ingit karne ke liye lete hai
 The last verse of the Quran was revealed in the year 10th Hijri on the 18th of the Islamic month of Dhu al-hijjah, a date that roughly corresponds to February or March 632
 paigambar ne gadir e khumm main apana upadesh dene ke baad yah khulaasa kiya tha
 After Muhammad's death in 632, many of his companions who knew the Quran by heart were killed in the Battle of Yamama by Musalima
 pehle khalipha, abu bakr, baad main pustak ko ek granth main ikattha karne kaa faisla kiya taaki ise sangrakshit kiya ja sake
 Zaid ibn Thabit was the first to collect the Quran as he wrote the verses and suras read from Muhammad, the Prophet of Allah
 is prakaar, shastreey samooh, sabase mahatvapurn zayd bin thabit ne chand ekatra kiye or puri kitaab kaa sankalan karke kuran ko kitaab kaa rup diya tha
 In this way, the Quran came in the form of a book and it was with Abu Bakr
 is kaary ke liye zayd ne un tamaam panne jinhen haddi par, patton par, pattharon par likhaa gaya tha or kai log kanthst bhi kiye the un sab kaa krodikaran kiya
 After Abu Bakr, Muhammad's widow Hafsa Bint Umar was assigned to this manuscript in about 650
 tisare khalif uthman ebn afaan ne quran ke uccharan main maamuli matbhedon ko dhyaan main rakhana shuru kiya kyonki islam arab prayadweep se pare faras, levent or uttari africa main failaa tha
 To preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use the copy of Abu Bakr and produce a standard copy of the Quran
 is prakaar, mohammad kii mrityu ke 20 varshon ke bheetar, quran likhit rup main patibaddh tha
 The text became the model from which copies were made and projected in urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed
 quran paath kaa vartmaan rup muslim vidwaanon dwaara abu bakar dwaara sankalit mul sanskaran mana jaataa he
 According to Shia, Ali ibn Abi Talib compiled a complete version of the Quran soon after Muhammad's death
 is paath kaa kram uthman ke yug ke dauraan baad main ikattha hua tha ki is sanskaran ko kalkram kram main ekatrit kiya gaya tha
 Despite this, he made no objection against the standardized Quran and accepted the Quran into circulation
 quran kii anya vyaktigat pratiyaan ebn masood or ube ebn kaab ke kodex samet maujuud ho sakati hai, jinamein se koi bhi aaj maujuud nahin he
 The Quran is most likely written in scattered form during Muhammad's lifetime
 kai strot bataate hai ki mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan badi sankhya main unke saathi ne khulaasa yaad kiya tha
 Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above understanding of the early development of the Quran
 quran apane vartmaan rup main academik vidwaanon dwaara mohammad dwaara boli jane vaale shabdon ko record karne ke liye aam taur par mana jaataa he kyonki verient kii khoj ne bahut mahatv nahin diya he
 Professor Fred Donner of the University of Chicago stated that "


 there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonant text of the Quran, possibly a broader and more diverse set of related texts in transmission
 is manakikrut cannical paath ke nirmaan ke baad, pehle aadhikarik granthon ko dabaa diya gaya tha, or sabhi maujuuda pandulipiyon - unke kai roopon ke baavjood-is maanak vyanjan paath kii sthapana ke baad ek samay kii taarikh lagati he
 "although most version readings of the Quranic text have ceased to be broadcast, some are still
 vahaan koi mahatvapurn paath nahin hua he jis par kuranik paath kaa vidwaan punarnirmaan aadhaarit ho saktaa he
 Historically, controversy over the content of the Quran has rarely become an issue, although debate on the subject continues
 1972 main, sanaa, yaman shahar main ek masjid main, pandulipiyon kii khoj kii gai thi jo baad main us samay maujuud sabase pracheen kuranik paath sabit hue the
 Sana's manuscripts have a page from which the parchment has been washed to make it reusable — a practice that was common in ancient times due to the lack of writing materials
 haalanki, behosh dhoyaa hua antarnihit paath abhi bhi mushkil se dikhaai detaa he or ise "purv-uthamanik" kuranik saamagree mana jaataa he, jabaki sheersh par likhe gaye paath ko uthamanik samay mana jaataa he
 Studies using radiocarbon dating show that parchments date back to the period prior to 671 CE with a 99 percent probability
 2015 main, 1370 saal pehle dating karne vaale bahut hi shuruaati quran ke tukade england ke birmingham vishvavidhyalay kii pustkaalay main khoje gaye the
 According to tests conducted by the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, "the parchment ranged between 568 and 645, with a probability of over 95%"
 pandulipi lija arabi ke praarambhik rup hijaaji lipi main likhi gai he
 This is possibly the oldest example of the Quran, but an extended date of trials is allowed, so it cannot be said with certainty which of the current versions is the oldest
 saudi vidwaan saud al-sirhaan ne tukdon kii umr main andeh vyakt kiya he kyonki unamem dots or adhyay vibhaajak shaamil hai jinhen mana jaataa he ki baad main iskaa janm hua tha
 Muslims believe that the Quran has become a book of divine guidance from God to Muhammad through Allah through Jibril and sees the Quran as God's final revelation to humanity
 islamic or kuranik sandarbhon main prakashitvaakya kaa matlab he ki ishwar kaa kaary kisi vyakti ko sambodhit karnaa, praptakartaaon kii ek badi sankhya ke liye sandesh bhejnaa
 The process through which a divine message comes to the heart of the Messenger of God is sordid or nazul
 jaisaa ki quran kahata he, "sachai ke saath hamane ise neeche bhej diya he or sachai ke saath yah neeche aa gaya he
 " quran aksar apane paath main jor detaa he ki ise ishwariya rup se niyukt kiya jaataa he
 Some verses in the Quran indicate that even Arabic-speaking people will understand the Quran if they are recited
 quran ek likhit purv-paath, "sangrakshit tablet" ko sanderbhit karata he, jo ise bhejne se pehle bhi bhagwaan ke bhaashan ko record karata he
 The issue that the Quran is eternal or created became a religious debate in the ninth century
 tark or tarksangat vichaaron ke aadhaar par dharamshastra ke ek islamic skool mutajilas ne kaha ki quran banaaya gaya tha, jabaki muslim dharmavidon kii sabase vyapak kismein quran ko ishwar ke saath sah-shaashvat maanate the or isliye akushal the
 Sufi philosophers frame this question as artificial or incorrect
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki quran kaa vartmaan shabd mohammad ko pataa chalaa he, or quran 15: 9 kii unki vyakhya ke anusaar, yah bhrashtachar se sangrakshit he 
 Muslims consider the Quran a guide, a sign of Muhammad's prophecy and the truth of religion
 quran kaa anokhaapan yah vishwaas he ki quran se kisi maanviya boli yaa koi saamagree se tulana nahin ho sakati
 The Quran is considered by Muslims to be an incomparable miracle, effective until the day of Yaum al-qiyama, and thus, providing central evidence to Muhammad in the certification of his prophetic status
 quran main aprihaaryta kii avadharana utpann hoti he, jahaan paanch alag-alag chhandon main virodhiyon ko quran kii tarah kuch utpann karne ke liye chunauti di jaati he: "yadi maanav or jinn is quran kii tarah vaani paidaa karne ke liye ek saath bandha bhi jaaen to ve kabhi bhi aisa nahin kar paayenge, yadi vah aapas main kitna bhi samarthan karke dekh len
 "so the suggestion is that if there are doubts related to the divine authorship of the Quran, then come forward and create something like that
 nauveen shatabdi se, kai log or kaam dikhaai die jo quran kaa adhyayan karte the or isaki style or saamagree kii jaanch karte the
 Medieval Muslim scholars, including al-jurjani and al-baqillani, have written several texts on the subject, discussed its various aspects, and used linguistic approaches to study the Quran
 anya log tark dete hai ki quran main mahaan vichaar hai, aantarik arth hai, umr ke madhyam se apni taazgi banaae rakhte hai
 And through the Quran there have been major changes on a personal level and in history
 kuch vidwaanon kaa kahana he ki quran main vaigyanik jaankaree he jo aadhunik vigyaan se sahamat he
 The doctrine of the miraculousness of the Quran emphasizes the illiteracy of Muhammad because of how the unknown prophet would have the ability to write the Quran
 is liye yah ishwar vaani he
 The first sura of the Quran is read and repeated in Sura e Fatiha daily prayers and other occasions
 yah sura, jisamen saat chand hote hai, quran kaa sabase adhik baar padhaa jane vaala sura he: Let me start in the name of God, who is very kind to me
 All praise is for the sake of God, who is God and master; And the one who carries all the living is a great kindness; Rosé is the master of Jaza; God we pray to you and seek help from you; So, keep us on the straight path; Their path, which you have not accepted, nor their path, on which you have been thrashed and misguided
 " Other sections of the Quran are also recited in daily prayers
 quran ke likhit paath kaa sammaan kai musalamaanon dwaara dharmik vishwaas kaa ek mahatvapurn tatv he, or quran ko sammaan ke saath mana jaataa he
 56:79 Based on tradition and a literal interpretation of the Quran, some Muslims believe that they must wazoo before touching a copy of the Quran, although this idea is not universal
 puraani bosida quran kii pratiyaan kapade main lapeti jaati hai or ek surakshit jagah main adab ke saath anishchit kaal tak sangrahit kii jaati hai
 Sometimes buried in a mosque or a Muslim cemetery, or burnt and ashes are buried or scattered over water
 islam main, islamic dharamshastra, darshan, rahasyavaad or nyaayashastra samet adhikansh bauddhik vishyon, quran se chintit hai yaa unki shikshaaon main unki neenv rakhte hai
 Muslims believe that preaching or reading the Quran holds more precedence
 is ke prachaar or padhne waalon ko divya puraskaron se puraskrit kiya jaataa he
 Doing this is called different types of Azhar, Sawab or Hasanah
 quran ne islamic kalaon or vishesh rup se sulekh or roshni ke tathakthith kuranik kalaon ko bhi prerit kiya
 The Quran is never decorated with pictorial images, but many Qurans are decorated with decorative patterns in the margins of the page or between the lines or at the beginning of the Surrey
 islamic chand kai anya media, bhawanon or masjidon yaa albamon ke liye masjid lamp, bartanon par, mitti ke bartanon or sulekh ke prishthon jaise sabhi aakaaron kii vastuon par dikhaai dete hai

 vah likhte hai: "quran saboot ke bina anumaan lagane ke khatre par dhyaan khinchataa he gyaan nahin kiya he 


 17:36) or kai alag-alag chhandon main musalamaanon se poochta he pramaanon kii aavashyaktaa ke liye, to saboot kii aavashyaktaa he, donon dharmik vishwaas or prakritik vigyaan main

 Ziauddin Sardar made a case for Muslims to develop the foundations of modern science in order to pay attention and reflect on the natural phenomena that the Quran repeatedly calls for
 bhautik vigyaani abdus salaam ne apane nobel puraskaar bhoj pate main quran kii ek prasiddh kavita uddhrut kii or phir kaha: "yah prabhaav sabhi bhautikavidon kaa vishwaas he: jitna gaharaa ham chaahate hai, utana hi adhik hamaare aashcharya utsahit, hamaare nazar kaa chamak he "
 One of Salam's core beliefs was that there is no contradiction between Islam and discoveries that science tells humanity about nature and the universe
 salaam ne yah bhi raay rakhi ki quran or adhyayan or tarksangat pratibimb kii islamic bhaavana asaadhaaran sabhyataa ke vikaas kaa strot thi
 Salaam, in particular, used Ibn al-haytham and al-biruni as pioneers of the empiricist who introduced the experimental approach, breaking with Aristotle's influence and thus giving rise to modern science

 The message of the Quran is conveyed with various literary structures and devices
 mul arabi main, surya or chand dhvanyatmak or vishaygat sanrachanaon ko niojit karte hai jo paath ke sandesh ko yaad karne ke liye darshakon ke prayaason main sahaayta karte hai
 Muslims insist that the content and style of the Quran are inappropriate
 quran kii bhashaa ko "kavita gadhy" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he kyonki yah kavita or gadhy donon kaa hissaa he; haalanki, yah vivaran kuranik bhashaa kii layaaddh gunvattta ko vyakt karne main vifal hone kaa jokhim chalaata he, jo kuch hisson main adhik kavy he or dusron main adhik gadhy jaisaa he
 The Quran, while found throughout the Quran, is typical of many earlier Mecca Suras, in which relatively few verses throw singing words into prominence
 is tarah ke rup kii prabhaavashiltaa udhaaharan ke liye sura 81 main spasht he, or isamen koi andeh nahin he ki in margon ne shrotaaon ke vivek ko prabhavit kiya
 a change of verse from one set of verses to another signal is often a change in the subject of discussion
 baad ke khand bhi is form ko sangrakshit karte hai lekin style adhik expogitary he
 The Quranic text has no beginning, middle or end, its nonlinear structure is similar to a web or net
 paathyacharya vyavastha ko kabhi-kabhi nirantarata kii kami, kisi bhi kalkram yaa vishaygat kram or doharaav kii anupasthiti ko pradarshit karne ke liye mana jaataa he
 Critic Norman O
 brown ke kaam kaa hawala dete hue maaikel bels, brown ke avlokan ko sweekaar karte hai ki kuranik saahitiyik abhivyakti ke prathit hone vaale vighatan - bikri ke vaakyansh main isaki bikhri hui yaa khandit mod - vastav main ek saahitiyik divaais sakasham he gaharaa prabhaav dene ke liye jaise bhavishyavaanee sandesh kii tivrata maanav bhashaa ke vaahan ko tod rahi thi jisamen ise sampreshit kiya ja rahaa tha
 Selling also addresses the recurrence of much discussion of the Quran, also seeing it as a literary device
 ek paath aatm-sanderbhit hota he jab yah swayan ke bare main bolta he or khud ko sanderbhit karata he
 According to Stephen Wilde, the Quran illustrates this metatextuality by explaining, classifying, interpreting and justifying the words to be transmitted
 un anuchhedon main aatm- refrencielity spasht he jahaan quran swayan ko ek aatmanirbhar tareeke se, samachar, maandand ke rup main swayan ko prakat karne ke rup main sanderbhit karata he
 There is a blessed remembrance that we sent down, so are you rejecting it now? "), Or in the frequent presence of the" say "tag, when Muhammad is ordered to speak
 junglee ke anusaar quran atyadhik aatm-sanderbhit he
 This feature is more pronounced in early Mecca Suras
 mukhya lekh: tafasir The Quran has sparked a vast body of commentary and interpretation intended to explain the meanings of Quranic verses, clarify their import, and unravel their significance
 tafaseer musalamaanon kii sabase shuruaati shaikshanik gatividhiyon main se ek he
 According to the Quran, Muhammad was the first person to describe the meanings of verses for early Muslims
 anya shuruaati nikaayon main mohammad ke kuch saathi shaamil the, jaise ' ali ebn abi talib ,' abdulla ebn abbaas, abdulla ebn umr or ubey ebn kaab 
 In those days exegesis was limited to the literary aspects of the poem, the background of its publication and, sometimes, the explanation of the interpretation of one poem with the help of another
 yadi kavita ek aitihaasik ghatana ke bare main thi, to kabhi-kabhi mohammad kii kuch paramparaon ko iskaa arth spasht karne ke liye varnit kiya gaya tha
 Since the Quran is spoken in classical Arabic, many of the latter did not convert to Islam, they did not always understand Quranic Arabic, they did not catch Muslims who were fluent in Arabic of Muslims and were concerned with settling subjects in the Quran
 Clear struggle of
 arabi main tippanee karne vaale tippaneekaron ne sanketon ko samajhaayaa, or shaayad sabase mahatvapurn baat yah samajhaayaa ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke karier main quran ke chhandon kaa khulaasa kiya gaya tha, jo ki sabase shuruaati muslim samudaay ke liye upyukt tha, or jise baad main prakat kiya gaya tha, radd karnaa yaa " nirast karnaa " nasakh ) pehle ke paath 
 However, other scholars say that there is no repeal in the Quran
 ahmadiya muslim samudaay ne quran par das khand vaali urdu tippanee prakashit kii he, jiskaa naam tafaseer i kabir he 
 The esoteric interpretation or Sufi interpretation attempts to unveil the inner meaning of the Quran
 sufiwaad chhandon ke spasht bindu se aage badhata he or iske bajaay quran ke chand ko aantarik yaa gudh or chetana or astitv ke aadhyatmik ayaamon se sambandhit karata he
 According to Sands, esoteric interpretations are more suggestive than declarative, they are indicative rather than explanatory
 ve sambhaavnaaon ko ingit karte hai jitna ki ve prayek lekhak kii antardrushti kaa pradarshan karte hai
 The Sufi interpretation, according to Annabel Keller, is also an example of the use of the subject of love, for example in the Qur'anic interpretation of the Quran
 quran 7: 143 kahata he: When Moses came at the time when we appointed, and his Allah spoke to him, he said, 'my Allah, show me yourself! let me see you!' He said, 'you won't see me, but look at that mountain, if it stays strong you will see me
 ' jab uske bhagwaan ne pahaad par khud ko prakat kiya, to usne ise kharaab kar diya
 Moses fainted
 jab vah thik ho gaya, usne kaha, 'jai ho! main tumse pashchaatap karata hoon! main vishwaas karne vaala pehla vyakti hum! In 7: 143 Moses, the way of those who are in love, comes asking for a vision but his will is denied, he is commanded to see other than the mountain, while the mountain is able to see God
 
 parvat par bhagwaan ke prakat hone kii drushti se parvat chur or musa behosh hojaate hai
 In the words of Kushayari, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and Moses of Moses had nothing left
 khud se unmoolan kii sthiti main, musa ko vaastaviktaaon kaa anaavaran diya gaya tha
 From a Sufi point of view, God always causes the will and suffering of the beloved and the wayfarer to realize the truth
 mohammad hossain taababatei kehete hai ki baad ke utthanon ke bich lokapriy spashtikaran ke anusaar, tavil kaa arth he ki ek kavita kaa nirdesh diya gaya he
 The meaning of revelation, as opposed to Tawal, is clear according to the explicit meaning of the words, as they were told
 lekin yah spashtikaran itnaa vyapak ho gaya he ki, vartmaan main, yah tavil kaa praathmik arth ban gaya he, jiskaa mul rup se "vaapasi karne" yaa "vaapasi sthaan" kaa arth tha
 In Tabatai's view, what is called taiwil or hermeneutic interpretation of the Quran is not concerned with the signification of words
 iske bajaay, yah kuch sachai or vaastaviktaaon se sambandhit he jo purushon ke saamaanya bhaag kii samaj se pare he; phir bhi yah in satyon or vaastaviktaaon se he ki siddhant ke siddhant or quran ke vyaavhaarik nishedh jari hai
 Interpretation is not the meaning of the poem but it is transparent in a particular type of transit through that meaning
 ek aadhyatmik vaastaviktaa he- jo ek kanoon kaa paalan karne kaa mukhya uddeshy he, yaa divine gun kaa varnan karne kaa mul uddeshy he- or phir ek vaastavik mahatv he ki ek quran kii kahani kaa sandarbh he
 According to Shia beliefs, which are strongly rooted in knowledge such as Muhammad and Imams, know the mysteries of the Quran
 tabatai ke anusaar, bayaan "koi bhi bhagwaan ko chhodkar isaki vyakhya ko jaanata he" kisi bhi virdohi yaa yogyata khand ke bina maanya rahata he
 Therefore, as far as this verse is concerned, knowledge of Quranic interpretation is reserved for God
 lekin Tabatabaei anya chhandon kaa upyog karata he or nishkarsh nikaala he ki jo log bhagwaan dwaara shuddh hai quran kii vyakhya kuch had tak pataa he
 According to Tabatai, there are esoteric interpretations that are acceptable and unacceptable
 sweekaarya ta'vil apane shabdic arth se pare ek kavita ke arth ko sanderbhit karata he; balki antarnihit arth, jo antat keval bhagwaan ke liye janaa jaataa he or akele maanav vichaaron ke madhyam se sidhe samajha nahin ja saktaa he
 The verses in question here refer to the human qualities of coming, going, sitting, contentment, anger, and sorrow, which are clearly attributed to God
 asweekaarya ta'wil vah he jahaan ek saboot ke madhyam se ek alag arth ke liye ek kavita kaa spasht arth "sthanantarit" hota he; yah vidhi spasht visangatiyon ke bina nahin he
 Although this unacceptable Ta'wil has gained considerable acceptance, it is incorrect and cannot be applied to Quranic verses
 sahi vyakhya yah he ki vaastaviktaa ek kavita ko sanderbhit karti he
 It is found in all verses, decisive and ambiguous alike; This is not the meaning of the word; It is a fact that it is too fantastic for words
 bhagwaan ne unhen apane dimag main thodaa sa laane ke liye shabdon ke saath taiyaar kiya he; is sambandh main ve kahaniyon kii tarah hai jinka upyog dimag main ek tasviir banane ke liye kiya jaataa he, or is prakaar shrota ko spasht rup se icchit vichaar ko samajhane main madad milti he
 One of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation before the 12th century is Sulami whose work would not have been preserved without most of the early Sufi commentaries
 sulaami kii pramukh tippanee hekik al-tafaseer kii ek pustak he jo pehle sufi kii tippaniyon kaa sankalan he
 Several other works, including commentaries from Kushayari, Dayalam, Shirazi and Suhrawardy, emerged from the 11th century
 in kaaryon main sulaami kii kitabon or lekhak ke yogadan se saamagree shaamil he
 Many works have been written in Persian such as the works of Mabri Kashf al-asrar
 rumi ne apni pustak mathnavi main vishaal rahasyamay kavita likhi thi
 Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in the translation of Rumi's work
 mathnavi main badi sankhya main kuranik maarg paae ja sakate hai, jinamein se kuch quran kii ek sufi vyakhya par vichaar karte hai
 Rumi's book is not exceptional for quotations and elaborations on the Quran, however, Rumi mentions the Quran more often
 simnani ne quran par gudh exegesis ke do prabhaavshaalee kaaryon ko likhaa tha
 He reconciled the sentiments of Sunni Islam with the ideas and manifestations of God in the material world
 18 veen shatabdi main ismail haaki bursavi ke kaam jaise vyapak sufi tippaniyan dikhaai detii hai
 His work Ruh al-bayan is a huge marifat
 arabi main likhaa gaya he, yah lekhak ke apane vichaaron ko unke purvavartiyon ke saath jodta he
 Unlike the Salafis and Zahiri, the Shia and Sufis as well as some other Muslim philosophers believe that the meaning of the Quran is not limited to the literal aspect
 unke liye, yah ek aavashyak vichaar he ki quran main bhi aantarik pahalu hai
 Henry Corbin describes a hadith that goes back to Muhammad: quran main bahari upasthiti or ek chhipi gaharaai, ek asaadhaaran arth or ek gudh arth he
 This esoteric meaning in turn hides an esoteric meaning
 to yah saat gudh arthon ke liye chalaa jaataa he
 According to this view, it has also become clear that the internal meaning of the Quran does not eliminate or invalidate its external meaning
 iske bajaay, yah aatma kii tarah he, jo sharir ko jivan detaa he
 Corbin considers the Quran to play a role in Islamic philosophy, as nanology itself goes hand in hand with the prophet
 paath ke zahir se nipatane vaali tippaniyon ko tafaseer kaha jaataa he, or batin se nipatane vaali harmenetic or gudh tippaniyon ko tavil, jisamen paath ko isaki shuruyaat main waapas lenaa shaamil he
 Commentators with an esoteric slant believe that the ultimate meaning of the Quran is known only to God
 iske vipareet, kuranik shabdikta, iske baad salaphis or jahiris, yah vishwaas he ki quran ko keval iske spasht arth main hi liya janaa chahie
 The reenactment is the name of the hermeneutic style of some former Muslims who converted to Christianity
 unki style yaa punrariti vigyaapan or gaiyr-vyavasthit he or maafee maangane kii disha main taiyaar he
 This tradition of interpretation is based on the following practices: grammatical rethinking, curriculum preference, retrieval, and rethinking concession
 mukhya lekh: quran anuwadyah bhi dekhen: quran ke anuwaadon kii suchikuran kaa anuwaad hameshaa samasyagrast or kathin rahaa he
 Many argue that the Quranic text cannot be reproduced in any other language or form
 iske alaava, ek arabi shabd ke sandarbh ke aadhaar par kai arth ho sakate hai, sateek anuwaad ko or bhi kathin banaate hai
 Nevertheless, the Quran has been translated into most African, Asian and European languages
 quran kaa pehla anuvadak salmaan farsi tha, jisane saatvin shatabdi ke dauraan surat al-fatiha kaa anuwaad farsi main kiya tha
 Another translation of the Quran was completed in 884 in Alwar by orders of Abdullah bin Omar bin Abdul Aziz, at the request of the Hindu king Mehrk

 The Samanid king, Mansoor I, ordered the group of scholars of Korsain to translate Tafsir al-tabari, originally in Arabic
 baad main 11 veen shatabdi main, abu mansoor abdulla al-ansaari ke chaatro main se ek ne farsi main quran ke ek purna tafaseer ko likhaa
 In the 12th century, the Quran was translated into Persian by Najm al-din Abu Hafs al-nasafi
 sabhi teen pustakon kii pandulipiyaan bache hai or kai baar prakashit hui hai
 The Islamic tradition also states that the translations were made for Emperor Negus of Abyssinia and the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, as both received letters containing verses from the Quran by Muhammad

 With the translation of the Bible, English translators have sometimes favored archaic English words and constructions over their modern or traditional counterparts; For example, two widely read translators, A
 Yusuf Ali and M

 Because of the passage of thousands of years, in the divine orders, human beings would add their thoughts, their convenience and create a new religion and distort the original religion and create a monstrosity and many times work against the divine orders
 kyon ki har prabhavi vyakti apni shakti ke aage sab ko natmastak dekhnaa chahta tha
 After all, the last prophet Hazrat Muhammad came to this earth with the Quran and the Quran came with the challenge of God that God himself would protect it

 According to the Quran's claim that he is for the people of the whole earth and for the rest of the time, but the Arabs of that time appear to be addressed to him
 sarsari taur par yahi lagata he ki koran us samay ke arabon ke liye hi avatarit kiya gaya tha lekin aap jab bhi kisi aise sthaan par pahunchein jab yah lage ki yah baat keval ek khaas kaal tathaa desh ke liye he, tab vahaan ruuk kar vichaar karen yaa ise note karke baad main is par vichaar karen to aap ko har baar lagegaa ki manushya har yug or har bhu bhaag kaa ek he or us par vah baat thik waisi hi lagu hoti he, jaisi us samay ke log|arabon par lagu hoti thi
 Great books have been written and can be written in relation to the Quran for Muslims

 There is a hadith recited from Hazrat Ali
 hazarat haaris faramaate hai ki main masjid main daakhil hua to dekha ki kuch log kuch samasyaon main jhagada kar rahe hai
 i went to Hazrat Ali and informed him
 hazarat ali ne farmaaya- kya yah baaten hone lageen? maine kaha, ji haa
 Hazrat Ali ordered- Remember i have heard from Rasul Allah
 aap ne farmaaya- khabardaar raho nikat hi ek bada fitanaa sar uthayega maine arz kiya- is fitane main nijaat kaa zariyaa kya hoga? farmaaya-allaah kii kitaab
 The entire squeeze of the Quran comes in this one hadith
 koran dharti par allaah kii antim kitaab uski khyaati ke anuroop he
 It is very easy and it is also very difficult
 aasaan yah tab he jab ise yaad karne ke liye padhaa jaae
 If you do not fail in your destiny and want instruction from the Quran, then Allah has made this book easy

 ) And what did Sahaba mean by this
 yahaan tak ki khud ko hazarat mohammad ke qadamon tak pahunchaa de ki khud sahabe koran kaa is bare main kya aadesh tha? On the other hand, in terms of knowledge, it has to be considered further and continuously forward

 The surface of human knowledge is constantly increasing

 Mouzaza refers to a miracle that is on the hands of a prophet or Rasul and is beyond human power, to which the human intellect is shocked
 In every age, whenever any Rasul reached the divine orders of man, miracles were given to him by Allah
 hazarat musa ko asa di gai, jisase kai chamatkaar dikhaae gayi
 Hazrat Isa was given the opportunity to resurrect the dead, to heal the sick
 kisi bhi nabi kaa asal muajaza vah he jise vah daawey ke saath pesh kare
 Hundreds of Mojaz are described on the hand of Hazrat Muhammad, but the claim which is presented with the claim and which is still present to the world as a miracle, is the Qur'an which this disciple of the world is unanswered
 Be made as shown
 yah daawa koran main kai sthaan par kiya gaya
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran purna rup se surakshit rahegaa, is daawey ko 1500 varsh biit gaye or koran surakshit he, purna surakshit he
 This has been proven, which is a miracle
 The Qur'an has stood the test of science, and its scientific narratives are preceded by scientific efforts
 yah bhi ek chamatkaar he
 1500 years ago in the Arabian desert, an illiterate person presented a book that showed its truth in front of all the instruments of the twentieth century
 yah kaary koran ke atirikt kisi anya kitaab ne kiya ho to vishwa uskaa naam jaananaa chahega
 This miraculous form of the Qur'an is for us today and may be another miraculous form of it for the time to come
 jis samay koran avtarit hua us yug main uskaa mukhya chamatkaar uskaa vaigyanik aadhaar nahin tha
 The miracle of the Quran in that era was its language, literature, eloquence, which shook the language knowledge of the Arabs of its time
 yahaan spasht karnaa uchit hoga ki us samay ke arabon ko apane bhashaa gyaan par itnaa garv tha ki ve shesh vishwa ke logon ko ajami kehete the
 Due to the style of the Qur'an, the Arabic linguists fell on their knees
 koran aisi kitaab he jiske aadhaar par ek kranti laai gai
 Such illiterate people of the desert who had no importance in the world map at that time
 koran kii shikshaaon ke kaaran, uske prastutakarta kii training ne unhe us samay kii mahaan shaktiyon ke samaksh laa khadaa kiya or ek aise korani samaaj kii rachana maatr 23 varshon main kii gai jiskaa uttar vishwa kabhi nahin de saktaa
 Even today, the world believes that the Quran and Hazrat Muhammad created an ideal society

 is bare main tiramizi main hazarat zayd bin araqam dwaara varnit haddees he jisamen kaha gaya he ki koran allaah kii rassi he jo zamin se asaman tak tani he
 The word is from Hazur, described by Hazrat Zaid
 There is another hadith mentioned in Tabrani, which states that one day when a person was brought to the Hazur Mosque, he saw some people reading the Quran sitting in a corner and explaining to each other
 yah dekh kar aap ke chehre par khushi kii lahar daud gai
 You reached that group of Sahaba and said to them - Do you believe that there is no other Mabud except Allah, i am the Messenger of Allah and the Quran is the book of Allah? Sahaba said, or Rasul Allah we testify that there is no Mabud except Allah, you are the Rasool of Allah and the Quran is the Book of Allah
 tab aapane kaha, khushiyaan manaao ki koran allaah kii vah rassi he jiskaa ek sira uske haath main he or doosraa tumhaare haath main
 In the same way, there are many more
 koran allaah kii rassi is arth main bhi he ki yah musalamaanon ko aapas main baandh kar rakhata he
 The unity of ideas in them, at the time of differentiation, presents a perfect model for judgment and life by the orders of Allah
 It is in the Qur'an itself to hold the rope of Allah firmly
 koran ke mul aadhaar par musalamaanon ke kisi gut main koi takaraav nahin he
 The Right to the Qur'an has five rights on every Muslim of the Qur'an, which he should fulfill according to his power and ability
 koran ko samajhane ke liye uske avateern kii prishth bhoomi jaananaa zaruri he
 This is not the kind of book that has been written in full and given to the Prophet that he should go and call people
 balki koran thodaa thodaa us kranti ke avasar par jo hazarat mohammad ne arab main aarambh kii thi, aavashyaktaa ke anusaar avatarit kiya gaya
 From the beginning, as soon as some part of the Qur'an descended, you would write it down and also tell with whom it would be read
 avateern ke kram se vidwaanon ne koran ko do bhaagon main baanta he
 One is the Makki portion, the other the Madni part

 Their history, their atmosphere

 After this, the people who occupied the political and economic power of Mecca, sensed this danger for themselves, that they had to leave their homes and die in the small number of Muslims
 khud nabi ko ek ghati main saare parivarajanon ke saath qaid rahanaa padaa or ant main makka chhod kar madina janaa padaa
 This was a very tough time for the Muslims and the Qur'an revealed by Allah at this time was the cutting of the sword and the speed of the flood
 jisane puraa kshaitra hilaa kar rakh diya
 There are consolations for Muslims and prayers during this difficult time, which was the main part of this eight-year Quran
 is hinsaatmak prakaran se spasht hota he ki maanviya rachanadharmita evam bhaawanaaon kaa prabhaav is granth kii rachana main rahaa
 Thirteen years after the Makki era, Muslims found a center in Medina
 jahaan saare imaan laane waalon ko ekatrit kar tisare daur kaa avateern shuru hua
 Here Muslims were introduced to two new types of people
 pratham yahudee jo yahan sadiyon se aabaad the or apane dharmik vishwaas ke anusaar antim nabi kii pratiksha kar rahe the
 But when he saw the last prophet in his second demise, he created a ruckus
 koran main is daur main ahale kitaab par koran main sakht tippaniyan kii gayi
 In this era, a group of malicious people was born among the Muslims who pretended to be Muslims and kept meeting their opponents
 yaheen musalamaanon ko sashastr sangharsh kii ajna mili or unhen nirantar makka vaasiyon ke hamalon kaa saamana karnaa padaa
 On the other hand, with the establishment of an Islamic state, the divine rules were created for the creation of the whole society
 yudhd, shanti, nyaay, samaajik reeti rivaaj, khan paan sabake bare main ishwar ke aadesh is yug ke koran kii visheshta hai
 On the basis of which Rasul of Allah created an ideal state of social equality
 jiske aadhaar par aaj sadiyon baad bhi hazarat mohammad kaa kram vishwa nayakon main pratham mana jaataa he
 He did not give verbal instructions in every field of life, but showed it by following it

 Monotheism, religious order, heaven, hell, patience, religion are subjects of perennialism that were repeated again and again

 keval yahi nahin usne registan ke anpadh logon ko aisa sabhy bana diya ki puure vishwa par is sabhyataa kii chhap se saikadon varshon baad bhi peechha nahin chhudaaya ja saktaa

 At this time, the world is considered the supreme knower of embryology

 After studying them, he said that the descriptions in the Quran regarding embryology are exactly in line with modern discoveries
 kuch aayaton ke bare main unhone kaha ki ve ise galat yaa sahi nahin kah sakate kyon ki ve khud is baat main anbhigya hai
 It also included the first verse of the Qur'an that was translated
 apane paravaradigaar kaa naam le kar padho, jisane paidaa kiya
 Who made man from the foot of blood

 aise saikadon udhaaharan hai jinhe koran kii is tikaa main aap nirantar padhenge
 There is a difference of opinion that when the Qur'an is such a siddha book, why do scholars differ from Hazrat Muhammad in his commentary so far
 yahaan itnaa kahana kaaphi hoga ki paigambar mohammad ne apane anuyaayiyon main sehatmand vibhed ko badhaava diya kintu matbhinnata ke aadhaar par kattarpan or gutbandi ko aapane pasand nahin kiya

 The literal verse Qur'an descended on Hazrat Muhammad, in divine words
 yah vahya shabdic he, arth ke rup main nahin
 This has to be clarified that in Christian educational institutions, it is taught that it is not in divine words but on the heart of the prophet that he describes it in his own words
 isaiyon ke liye yah vishwaas isliye zaruri he ki bibil main jo badlaav unhone kiye hai, use ve isi prakaar satya bataa sakate the
 The entire Christian and Jewish world has been trying for centuries to somehow prove that the Qur'an is the words of Hazrat Muhammad and is his creation

 Population about 1 xxrep 4 0 sadak maarg The Quran, the Quran or Koran is the holiest book of Islam and its foundation
 musalmaan maanate hai ki ise allaah ne farishte jibril dwaara hazarat mohammad ko sunaaya tha
 Muslims believe that the Quran is the last and supreme book sent by Allah
 yah granth lagbhag 1400 saal pehle avataran hui he
 According to the beliefs of Islam, Hazrat Muhammad was revealed by the Qur'an Allah's angel Jibril until his death in 61032
 haalanki aarambh main iskaa prasar maukhik rup se hua par pigambar mohammad kii maut ke baad san 633 main ise pehali baar likhaa gaya tha or san 653 main ise manakikrut kar isaki pratiyaan islamic samrajya main vitarit kii gayi thi
 Muslims believe that the last of the holy messages sent by God are written in the Quran
 in sandeshon kii shuruyaat aadam se hui thi
 Hazrat Adam was the earliest prophet in Islamic beliefs and can be compared to an extent with the Manu of Hinduism
 jis tarah se hindu dharm main manu kii santanon ko maanav kaha gaya he vaise hi islam main aadam kii santanon ko aadmi kaha jaataa he
 Tauheed, religious order, Jannat, Jahannam, Patience, Dharma are subjects of perenniality which were repeated again and again
 koran ne apane samay main ek sidhe saadhe, nek vyapaaree insaan ko, jo apane parivaar main ek bharpoor jivan guzaar rahaa tha

 keval yahi nahin usne registan ke anpadh logon ko aisa sabhy bana diya ki puure vishwa par is sabhyataa kii chhap se saikadon varshon baad bhi iske nishaan pakke milte hai
 The Quran presented the ideals of war, peace, state governance, family, which have influence in human society today
 musalamaanon ke anusaar kuran main die gaye gyaan se ye sabit hota he ki hazarat mohammad ek islamic pigambar nabi he | The first mention of the word "qur'an" is found in the Qur'an itself where it means - he read, or he read
 yah shabd iske syrian samanaantar courienna kaa arth letaa he jiskaa arth hota he granthon ko padhanaa
 Although Westernists associate it with the Syrian word, most Muslims believe that its root is the word Qur'a
 par chaahe jo hazarat mohammad ke janmdin ke samay hi yah ek arabi shabd ban gaya tha
 The word has been mentioned some 70 times in the Qur'an itself
 iske alaave bhi koran ke kai naam hai
 It has also been addressed by names such as Al Furaqan, Al Hikmah, Dhikr / Zikr and Mashhaf
 koran main allaah ne 25 ambia kaa zikr kiya he
 The word Quran appears about 70 times in the Quran, which assumes different meanings
 yah arabi kriya qara kaa ek maukhik sangya he, jiskaa arth he "vah padhata he"
 Syriac is the equivalent qarayana, which refers to "reading scripture" or "lesson"
 jabaki kuch pashchimi vidwaan is shabd ko siriek se praapt karne par vichaar karte hai, muslim adhikariyon ke bahumat main shabd kii utpatti qara hi hoti he
 Regardless, it had become an Arabic word during Muhammad's lifetime
 shabd kaa ek mahatvapurn arth "paath kaa kaary" he, jaisaa ki praarambhik kurani maarg main darshaya gaya he: "yah hamaare liye ise ikattha karnaa or ise padhanaa he 
 In other verses, the term refers to "a personal passage"
 iskaa kai sandarbh main kai prakaar se adab kiya jaataa he
 As an example: "when al-quran is recited, listen to it and be silent
 " anya dharmon ke granth jaise torah or susamachar ke saath varnit arth bhi grahan kar saktaa he
 The word also has synonyms which are employed throughout the Quran
 prayek samanaarthi kaa apana alag arth hota he, lekin iskaa upyog kuch sandarbhon main quran ke saath mil saktaa he
 In such words the book, Ayah; And sura
 baad ke do shabd bhi prakaashan kii ikaayiyon ko darshaate hai
 In the large majority of references, usually with a definite article, the term is referred to as "publication", which has been "sent" at intervals
 anya sambandhit shabd hai: dhikkaar, quran ko ek anusmarak or chetavanee ke arth main sanderbhit karata he, or hikmah, kabhi-kabhi prakaashan yaa iske hisse kaa zikr karata he
 The Quran describes itself as "prudence", "mother of texts", "guide", "wisdom", "remembrance"
 or "rahasyodghatan" 
 Another word is al-kitab, although it is also used in Arabic for other scriptures, such as the Torah and the Bible
 musahaf shabd kaa prayog aksar vishesh kuranik lipiyon ke sandarbh main kiya jaataa he lekin quran main bhi pehle kii kitabon kii pahchaan karne ke liye prayog kiya jaataa he
 Islamic tradition relates that Muhammad received his first revelation during his prayer in the cave of Hira on the mountains
 iske baad, unhen 23 varshon kii avadhi main puraa koran kaa khulaasa praapt hua
 According to the hadith and Muslim history, after Muhammad came to Medina and formed an independent Muslim community, he ordered many of his companions to read the Quran and learn and teach the laws, which were told daily
 yah sambandhit he ki kuch kurash jinhen badr kii ladaai main kaidiyon ke rup main le jaaya gaya tha, unhone kuch musalamaanon ko us samay ke saral lekhan ko sikhaye jane ke baad apni aazaadee hasil kar lee
 Thus a group of Muslims gradually became literate
 jaisaa ki shuru main kaha gaya tha, quran ko takhton, khaalon, haddiyon, or ke tane ke chaude lakadiyon par darj kiya gaya tha
 Most suras were in use among Muslims as they have been mentioned in many hadiths and histories by both Sunni and Shia sources, relating to Muhammad's use of the Quran as a call to Islam, as a way of praying and reading
 haalanki, quran 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke samay pustak rup main maujuud nahin tha
 There is an agreement among scholars that Muhammad himself did not write the revelation
 sahih al-bukaari haddees main mohammad ko rahasyodghatan kaa varnan karte hue bataaya, "kabhi-kabhi yah ghanti bajane kii tarah " or aaisha ne bataaya, "maine dekha ki paigambar bahut hi thande din main vahi se prerit ho rahe hai or unke maathe se pasinaa nikal rahaa tha
 As soon as the inspiration of the same was over, his restlessness would go away
 " quran ke anusaar mohammad kaa pehla prakaashan, ek drushti ke saath tha
 The medium of revelation is described as "a powerful one", a person who was "on the topmost horizon when clear to see
 phir vah nikat aa gaya or mohammad se baat karne laga
 "islamic study scholars state in the Welch encyclopedia that they believe that Muhammad's condition and descriptions at these moments can be considered real, as he was severely disturbed after these revelations
 velch ke mutabik, mohammad kii preranaon kii atimanvi utpatti ke liye unke aas-paas ke logon ne in daure ko dekha hoga
 However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a person, a poet, or a magician because his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures in ancient Arabia
 velch atirikt rup se bataata he ki yah anishchit he ki mohammad ke bhavishyavaaniyon ke praarambhik daawey se pehle yaa baad main ye anubhav hue the
 The Quran describes Muhammad as "ummi", which is traditionally interpreted as "uneducated", but its meaning is more complex
 madhyakaalin tippaneekaron jaise al-tabari ne kaha ki is shabd ne do arthon ko prerit kiya: pehla, saamaanya rup se padhane yaa likhane main asamarthta; doosraa, pichhali kitabon yaa granthon kii anubhavheenata yaa agyanta 
 Muhammad's illiteracy was taken as an indication of the reality of his prophecy
 udhaaharan ke liye, fakhruddin al-raji ke anusaar, yadi mohammad ne lekhan or padhai main maharath hasil kii thi to sambhawatah unhen purvajon kii kitabon kaa adhyayan karne kaa andeh hota
 Some scholars, like Watt, prefer the second meaning of "ummi" - they first take it to indicate unfamiliarity with sacred texts
 quran kii antim aayat varsh 10veen hijri main dhu al-hijjah ke islamic maheene ke 18 veen tarikh ko prakat hui thi, jo ek taarikh he jo mote taur par farvari yaa march 632 se mail khaati he 
 This was revealed after the Prophet gave his sermon in Ghadir e Khumm
 632 main mohammad kii mrityu ke baad, unke kai saathi jo quran ko kanthst jaanate the, musalimaa dwaara yamama kii ladaai main maare gaye the
 The first Khalifa, Abu Bakr, later decided to gather the book into a book to preserve it
 zayd ebn thabit quran ko ikattha karne vaale pehle vyakti the kyonki vah allaah ke nabi mohammad se padhe gaye aaayaaton or suron ko likhaa karte the
 Thus, the most important of the classical group, Zaid bin Thabit, collected verses and compiled the entire book to give the Qur'an the form of a book
 is tarah quran ek granth ke rup main aagai or uski prati abu bakr ke saath hi rahi
 For this work, Zaid has cropped all the pages which were written on the bone, on the leaves, on the stones and many people had memorized them
 abu bakar ke baad, mohammad kii vidhwaa hafasa bint umr ko lagbhag 650 main is pandulipi ko saunpa gaya tha
 The third Caliph Uthman ibn Afan began to notice slight differences in the pronunciation of the Quran as Islam spread beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa
 paath kii pavitrataa ko sangrakshit karne ke liye, unhone jayad kii adhyakshata main ek samiti kaa aadesh diya taaki abu bakar kii pratilipi kaa upyog kiya ja sake or quran kii ek maanak prati taiyaar kii ja sake
 Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed in written form
 yah paath us model ban gaya jahaan se muslim duniya ke shahari kendron main pratiyaan banaai gayi or prakshepit kii gayi, or anya sanskarnon ko nasht kar diya gaya mana jaataa he
 The current form of Quran recitation is considered by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr
 shiya ke anusaar, ali ebn abi talib ne mohammad kii mrityu ke turant baad quran kaa ek purna sanskaran sankalit kiya
 The sequence of this text was gathered later during Uthman's era that this version was collected in chronological order
 iske baavjood, unhone manakikrut quran ke khilaaf koi aapatti nahin kii or quran ko parisancharan main sweekaar kar liya
 Other individual copies of the Quran may exist, including the codecs of Ibn Mas'ud and Ube ibn Ka'b, none of which exist today
 quran mohammad ke jeevankaal ke dauraan bikhri hui likhit rup main sabase adhik sambhaavna he
 Several sources indicate that a large number of his companions had missed the revelation during Muhammad's lifetime
 praarambhik tippaniyan or islamic aitihaasik strot quran ke shuruaati vikaas kii uparyukt samaj kaa samarthan karte hai
 The Quran in its current form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad as the discovery of variants has not given much importance
 chicago vishvavidhyalay ke professor fred donor ne kaha ki "


 quran ke ek samaan vyanjan paath ko sthapit karne kaa ek bahut hi shuruaati prayaas tha, jo sambhawatah sancharan main sambandhit granthon kaa ek vyapak or adhik vividh samooh tha
 After the creation of this standardized canonical text, the first official texts were suppressed, and all existing manuscripts — despite their many variants — seem to date back to a time after the establishment of this standard consonant text
 " haalanki quran ke paath ke adhikansh sanskaran reeding ko prasaarit karnaa band kar diya gaya he, kuch abhi bhi hai
 There has been no significant text on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text can be based
 aitihaasik rup se, quran kii saamagree par vivaad shaayad hi kabhi ek mudda ban gaya he, haalanki is vishay par bahes jari he
 In 1972, in a mosque in the city of Sana'a, Yemen, manuscripts were discovered that later proved to be the oldest Quranic text existing at the time
 sanaa kii pandulipiyon main ek prishth he jisamen se charmpatr pun: prayojya banane ke liye dhoyaa gaya he- ek abhyaas jo pracheen samay main lekhan saamagree kii kami ke kaaran aam tha
 However, the faint washed-out underlying text is still barely visible and is considered "pre-uthmanic" Quranic content, while the text written at the top is considered Uthmanic time
 radiocarbon dating kaa upyog karne vaale adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki charmpatr 671 sii se pehle kii avadhi ke liye 99 pratishat sambhaavna ke saath dinaankit hai
 In 2015, very early Quran fragments dating back 1370 years were discovered in the library of the University of Birmingham, England
 oxford uniwarsity radiocarbon excelerator unit dwaara kiye gaye pareekshanon ke mutabik, "95% se adhik kii sambhaavna ke saath, charmpatr 568 or 645 ke bich tha"
 The manuscript is written in the Hijaji script, an early form of Liza Arabic
 yah sambhawatah quran kaa sabase purana udhaaharan he, lekin pareekshanon kii ek vistrut taarikh kii anumati he, isliye yah nishchit rup se nahin kaha ja saktaa ki maujuuda sanskarnon main se koun sa sabase purana he
 Saudi scholar Saud al-sarhan has expressed doubts over the age of the fragments because they contain dots and chapter separators that are believed to have originated later
 muslimon kaa maananaa he ki quran 23 saal kii avadhi main allaah ne jibril ke madhyam se ishwar se mohammad se divya maargdarshan kii pustak ban gaya he or quran ko maanavtaa ke liye bhagwaan ke antim prakaashan ke rup main dekhtaa he
 Revelation in Islamic and Quranic contexts means the act of God addressing a person, sending a message to a large number of recipients
 jis prakriya se ishwar ke sandeshvahak ke dil main divine sandesh aata he vah tanzil yaa nuzul he
 As the Quran states, "with the truth we have sent it down and with the truth it has come down
 " The Quran often emphasizes in its text that it is divinely ordained
 quran main kuch chand yah ingit karte hai ki arabi bolne vaale bhi log quran ko samajhenge agar unhen sunaaya jaataa he
 The Quran refers to a written pre-text, "protected tablet", which records the speech of God even before it is sent
 quran shaashvat yaa banaaya gaya mudda yah mudda nauveen shatabdi main ek dharmik bahes ban gaya
 Mu'tazilas, an Islamic school of theology based on logic and rational thought, stated that the Quran was created, while the most widespread varieties of Muslim theologians considered the Quran to be co-eternal with God and therefore unskilled
 sufi darshanik is sawaal ko kritrim yaa galat tareeke se taiyaar karte hai
 Muslims believe that the current word of the Quran is revealed to Muhammad, and according to their interpretation of Quran 15: 9, it is protected from corruption
 muslim quran ko maardarshak maanate hai, mohammad kii bhavishyavaanee or dharm kii sachai kaa sanket
 The uniqueness of the Quran is the belief that the Quran cannot be compared to any human dialect or any material
 quran ko musalamaanon dwaara ek athulaneey chamatkaar mana jaataa he, jo yom al-qiyama ke din tak prabhavi hota he, or is prakaar, mohammad ko unke bhavishyavaaniyon kii sthiti ke pramanikaran main kendriya pramaan pradaan kiya jaataa he
 The concept of indispensability arises in the Quran, where in five different verses, opponents are challenged to produce something like the Quran: "if humans and jinn are bound together to produce a voice like this Quran" So they will never be able to do this, if they can support themselves with each other and see
 " to suzav yah he ki yadi quran ke divya lekhakatv se sambandhit andeh hai, to aage aaen or aisa kuch banaaen
 From the ninth century, many people and works appeared that studied the Quran and examined its style and content
 al-jurjani or al-baqillani sahit madhyayugin muslim vidwaanon ne is vishay par kai granthon ko likhaa he, iske vibhinn pahaluon par charchaa kii he, or quran kaa adhyayan karne ke liye bhashaai drushtikon kaa upyog kiya he
 Others argue that the Quran has great ideas, internal meanings, maintaining its freshness through the ages
 or quran ke zariye vyaktigat str par or itihaas main bade badlaav hue hai
 Some scholars say that the Quran contains scientific information that agrees with modern science
 quran kii chamatkarita ke siddhant par mohammad kii nirakshartaa par jor diya gaya he kyonki agyaat bhavishyadvaktaa ko quran likhane kii kshamta kaise hogi
 That is why this is the voice of God
 quran kaa pehla sura sura e fatiha dainik prarthanaaon or anya avasaron main padhaa or doharaaya jaataa he
 This sura, which consists of seven verses, is the most frequently read sura of the Quran: shuru karata hoon khuda ke naam se jo bada meharbaan nihaayat raham vaala he; sab tarif khuda hi ke liye hai zo sabaqa rab ar maaliq he; or saare jahaann kaa paalane vaala bada meharbaan raham vaala he; roze jaza kaa maalik he; kudaaya ham teri hi ibaadat karte hai or tujh hi se madad chaahate hai; to hamako sidhi raah par sabit qadam rakhwa; unki raah jinhen tuune naimat ata kii he na unki raah jin par tera gazab dhaayaa gaya or na gumraahon kii
 " quran ko anya varg bhi dainik prarthanaaon main padhate hai
 Respect for the written text of the Quran is an important element of religious belief by many Muslims, and the Quran is treated with respect
 parampara ke aadhaar par or quran kii ek shabdic vyakhya 56:79, kuch musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki unhen quran kii ek prati chune se pehle vazu karnaa hoga, haalanki yah vichaar nahin he saarvbhaumik
 Copies of the Purani Bosida Quran are wrapped in cloth and stored indefinitely with adab in a safe place
 kabhi masjid yaa ek muslim kabristaan main dafnaaya jaataa he, yaa jala diya jaataa he or raakh ko dafan kiya jaataa he yaa pani par bikharaa hua hota he
 In Islam, most intellectual disciplines, including Islamic theology, philosophy, mysticism, and jurisprudence, are concerned with the Quran or have their foundations in their teachings
 musalamaanon kaa maananaa he ki quran ke prachaar yaa padhanaa adhik praadhanyata rakhata he
 Those who preach and study it are rewarded with divine rewards
 aisa karnaa vibhinn prakaar ke ajahar, sawab yaa hasanh kaha jaataa he
 The Quran also inspired the Islamic arts and especially the so-called Quranic arts of calligraphy and illumination
 quran ko chitrakaari chhaviyon se kabhi sajaayaa nahin jaataa he, lekin kai kuranon ko prishth ke margin main yaa linon ke bich yaa sure kii shuruyaat main sajaavati pattern ke saath sajaayaa jaataa he
 Islamic verses appear on many other media, buildings and objects of all sizes, such as mosque lamps for mosques or albums, on pots, pottery and pages of calligraphy

 Apart from division into suras and being independent, there are several ways to divide the Quran into parts of approximately equal length for convenience in reading
