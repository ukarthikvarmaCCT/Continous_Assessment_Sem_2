 But at 100 ° c it is destroyed by humid heat
 yah kinavan utpann karata hai
 For this reason, its practice has been going on for thousands of years in making Pavarotti, Sura or Beer etc
, although the reason for this was first discovered by Cagnard Delatur
 unhone hi siddh kiya tha ki yeast sajiv padap hai, jo mukulan prakriya se badhata hai
 Organic substances, especially starch and sugars, contain fermentation from yeast
 yeast koshikaon kii vruddhi ke saath saath unase anzime banate hai
 These are the enzymes diastase, the invertance and the jimes
 diastess starch ko vighatit karata, invartes ikshushrkara ko glucose or fructose main parinat karata or jimes glucose or fructose sharkaraaon ko alcodaul or carbon dioxide main parinat karata hai
 All these processes are done in the appropriate stage
 kinavan kaa upyukt taap 25 degree - 30 degree sein0 hai
 There are two types of trade yeast, one is dry and the other is compressed
 yeast ko makai ke aate yaa starch ke saath milakar tikia banaai jaati he or tab use sukhaya jaataa he
 This is dry butter
 is rup main yeast niskriy yaa prasupt rahata he or bahut kaal tak surakshit rakhaa ja saktaa hai
 It is activated by mixing with appropriate substances and then it is used
 sampidit yeast main praryaapt starch or ardrata rahati he
 This leads to kinevan in a short period of time
 yah yeast adhik samay tak surakshit nahin rakhaa ja saktaa he
 It is necessary to keep it in a cool place to keep it safe

 Subrata Mitra, who gained fame from the Apu trilogy, is considered one of the best mobile cinematographers in India
 subrat mitra kii filmein Drama is a form of poetry
 jo rachana shravan dwaara hi nahin apitu drushti dwaara bhi darshakon ke hriday main rasanubhuti karaati he use naatak yaa drishy-kavy kehete hai
 The play has more elegance than audio poetry
 shravy kavy hone ke kaaran yah lok chetana se apekshaakrit adhik ghanishtha rup se sambhddha he
 Folk consciousness in the Natyasastra has been considered the primary inspiration for the writing and staging of the play
 naatak kii ginati kaavyon main he
 Poetry is considered to be of two types - audio and visual
 isi drishy kavy kaa ek bhed naatak mana gaya he
 But mainly because of its eclipse by sight, visuals have started to call poetry as drama
 bharatmuni kaa naatyashaastra is vishay kaa sabase pracheen granth miltaa he
 The Agnipuran also has a representation of the characteristics of drama etc
 usamen ek prakaar ke kavy kaa naam prakeern kaha gaya he
 This book has two distinctions - poetry and actors
 agnipurana main drishy kavy yaa roopak ke 27 bhed kahe gaye hai— Characteristics, distinctions, etc
 of the play are given more clearly in the literature
 upar likhaa ja chukaa he ki drishy kavy ke ek bhed kaa naam naatak he
 There are two main categories of visual poetry - metaphor and metaphor
 roopak ke das bhed hai— roopak, naatak, prakaran, bhaan, vyayog, samavakaar, dim, ihamrig, ankavithi or prahasan
 There are eighteen distinctions of 'uparupaka' - Natika, Trotak, Goshthi, Sattak, Natyarasak, Departure, Ullapya, Kavya, Observance, Rasak, Sanlapak, Shrigadit, Shimpak, Vilasika, Durmallika, Kesika, Halisha and Bhanika
 uparyukt bhedon ke anusaar naatak shabd drishy kavy maatr ke arth main bolte hai
 According to the literature, the play should be written with a 'famous circle'
 vah bahut prakaar ke vilaas, sukh, dukh, tathaa anek rason se yukt hona chahie
 It should contain from five to ten digits
 naatak kaa nayak dhirodatt tathaa prakhyat vansh kaa koi pratapi purush yaa rajarshi hona chahie
 The principal or angi rasa of the play is Shringar and Veer
 shesh ras gaun rup se aate hai
 The metaphor in which tranquility, peace, compassion etc
 can not be called drama
 sandhisthal main koi vismayajanak vyapaar hona chahie
 Mars must be shown in the epilogue
 viyogant naatak sanskrit alankaar shaastra ke viruddh he
 The action that takes place before the acting starts, is called puvarang
 purvarang, ke uparaant pradhan nat yaa sutaradhar, jise sthaapak bhi kehete hai, aakar sabha kii prashansa karata he phir nat, nati sutaradhar ityadi paraspar vaartalap karte hai jisamen khele janevaale naatak kaa prastaav, kavi-vansh-varnan aadi vishay aa jate hai
 This part of the play is called the prologue
 jis itivrutt ko lekar naatak rachaa jaataa he use 'vastu' kehete hai
 There are two types of 'object' - official object and relevant object
 jo samast itivrutt kaa pradhan nayak hota he use 'adhikari' kehete hai
 Whatever is described in relation to this officer is called 'official object'; Like, the character of Rama in Ramlila
 is adhikari ke upkaar ke liye yaa raspushti ke liye prasangvash jiskaa varnan aa jaataa he use praancegik vastu kehete hai; jaise sugriv, aadi kaa charitra
 'to bring to the fore' means to present a visual face
 atah avasthanurup anukaran yaa swaang kaa naam hi abhinay he
 There are four types of acting - Aangik, Vachik, Dietary and Satvik
 angon kii cheshtaa se jo abhinay kiya jaataa he use angik, vachanon se jo kiya jaataa he use vaachik, bhes banaakar jo kiya jaataa hai use aharya tathaa bhaavon ke udrek se camp, swead aadi dwaara jo hota he use satvik kehete hai
 The seed, point, flag, light and action in the play are achieved by these five
 jo baat munh se kehete hi chaaron ore fail jaay or falsiddhi kaa pratham kaaran ho use beej kehete hai, jaise venisanhaar naatak main bhim ke krodh par yudhisthir kaa utsaahvaaky draupadi ke keshmojan kaa kaaran hone ke kaaran beej he
 If one thing is complete, even if it is not related to the second sentence, then bring such sentences in which there is no inconsistency with the other sentence is 'point'
 bich main kisi vyapak prasang ke varnan ko pataakaa kehete hai— jaise uttarcharit main sugriv kaa or abhigyaan- shankutal main vidooshak kaa charitravarnan
 a country wide characterization is called Prakari
 aarambh kii hui kriya kii falsiddhi ke liye jo kuch kiya jaay use kaary kehete hai; jaise, ramlila main ravan vadh
 One topic is being discussed, in the meantime, if another subject is present and it is known in the mail with the first topic, there is a place of sign, like, in Ramcharit, Ram is saying to Sita - "oh dear! i am not intolerant about you, if it is unbearable, then only your antagonism, in the meantime, the Pratihari comes and says: God! Offense present
 yahan ' upasthit' shabd se 'virah upasthit' aisi prathit hota he or ek prakaar kaa chamatkaar maaloom hota he
 Many similar drama-related skills have been introduced in Sanskrit literature and various types of differentiation have been shown
 aajkal deshbhashaon main jo nae naatak likhe jate hai unamem sanskrit naatakon ke sab niyamon kaa paalan yaa vishyon kaa samavesh anaavashyak samajha jaataa he
 Bharatendu Harishchandra writes - 'like a Sanskrit drama, it is futile to research them in Hindi drama or to write a play diligently in a Natakang; Because by editing the ancient natakadi, adorning the modern signs, the opposite happens and the effort is wasted
 bharat main abhinay-kala or rangamanch kaa vaidic kaal main hi nirmaan ho chukaa tha
 After that, Sanskrit theater had reached the pinnacle of its progress - Bharati Muni's Natyashastra is the proof of this
 bahut pracheen samay main bharat main sanskrit naatak dharmik avasaron, saanskrithik parvon, saamaajik samarohon evam rajkeey bolchaal kii bhashaa nahin rahi to sanskrit naatakon kii manchikaran samaapt-sa ho gaya
 The promotion of plays in India is from very ancient times
 bharat muni kaa naatayashastra bahut purana he
 Nuts and dramas are mentioned in Ramayana, Mahabharata, Harivansh etc
 panini ne 'shilaali' or 'krishashv' naamak do natsutrakaron ke naam liye hai
 Shilali gets its name from Shukla Yajurvedi Shatapatha Brahmin and Samvediya Anupada Sutra
 vidwaanon ne jyotish kii gananaa ke anusaar shatapath brahman ko 4000 varsh se upar kaa batalaaya he
 Therefore, this opinion of some Western scholars rightly originated in drama in Greece or Greece, it is not right
 harivansh main likhaa he ki jab pradhyumna, samb aadi yadav rajkumaar vajranabh ke poor main gaye the tab vahaan unhone ramajanm or rambhaavisar naatak khele the
 Previously, he had tied the background, from which the women sang sweetly
 shur naamak yadav ravan bana tha, manovati naam kii stri rambha bani thi, pradhyumna nalkubar or samb vidooshak bane the
 Western scholars like Wilson etc
 have clearly acknowledged that the Hindus had developed drama on their own
 pracheen hindu raja bady bady rangashalas banavaate the
 Surguja is a hilly place in Madhya Pradesh, there are signs of a theater of this type found inside a cave
 yah thik he ki unaniyon ke aane ke purv ke sanskrit naatak aajkal nahin milte hai, par is baat se inkaa abhaav, itane pramaanon ke rahete, nahin mana ja saktaa
 It is possible, when the Hindu caste has got union with the well-to-do Greek caste, then just as some other things were accepted by each other
 isi prakaar naatak ke sambandh main kuch baaten hinduon ne bhi apane yahan lee hon
 Seeing the 'jawanika' name of the outer layer, some people suggest Yavana connection
 ankon main jo 'drishy' sanskrit naatakon main aae hai unase anumaan hota he ki in paton par chitra bane rahete the
 As much as Astu can be said about this subject, those who used to act in very ancient times
 unamem chitrapat kaam main nahin laae jate the
 He was promoted after Alexander's arrival
 ab bhi ramlila, raasalila bina paradon ke hoti hi hai
 Democracy in regional languages emerged in the medieval period
 yah vicitra sanyog he ki muslimkaal main jahaan shaskaon kii dharmakattarata ne bharat kii saahitiyik rang-parampara ko tod daalaa vahaan lokbhashaon main lokmanch kaa acha prasar hua
 Lokalharmi Natyamanch continued in the form of Raslila, Ramlila and Nautanki etc
 bhaktikaal main ek ore to braj pradesh main krishna kii raasalilaon kaa brajabhasha main atyadhik prachlan hua or duusari or vijaydashami ke avasar par samooche bharat ke chote-bade nagaron main ramlila badi dhoomdhaam se manaai jane lagi
 Literally, in this medieval period, some Sanskrit dramas were also composed in Hindi chhayanuvad, such as' Abhigyan Shakuntal ',' Navaaz ',' malati-madhav ', Somnath,' Hrudayamacharit 'hanumannataka', etc
; Some original compositional interactive works were also done, such as Lachhiram's 'karunabharan', Raghuram Nagar's 'sabhasara', Ganesh poet's work 'pradyumnvijay' etc
; But the dramatic method was not completely maintained in them
 ye keval sanvadatmak rachanaayen hi kahi ja sakati hai
 Thus due to lack of literary vision and literary works, there was no tendency towards literary theater in the medieval period
 sach to yah he ki aadhunik kaal main vyavsaayik tathaa saahitiyik rangamanch ke udai se purv hamaare desh main ramlila, nautanki aadi ke lokmanch ne hi chaar-paanch sau varshon tak hindi rangamanch ko jivit rakhaa
 This folk-tradition is present in the entire country till date
 uttar bharat main ramlilaon ke atirikt mahabharat par aadhaarit ‘vir abhimanyu’, ‘satya harishchandra’ aadi drame tathaa ‘rup-basant’, ‘hir-raanjha’, ‘hakikatraay’, ‘bilwamangal’ aadi nautankiyan aaj tak prachlit hai
 Theater was encouraged in modern times with the establishment of the English state
 falat: samooche bharat main vyavsaayik naatak mandaliyaan sthapit huin
 The trend of Natyarangan first appeared in Bengali
 san 1835 i
 ke aasapaas kalakatta main kai avyavsaayik rangashaalaon kaa nirmaan hua
 Some of Calcutta's elite families and nobles had contributed to the creation of them and on the other hand the commercial drama was different from the unabashed effort of the circles
 banglaa ke is natya-srijan or natyarangan kaa adhyayan isliye mahatvapurn he, kyonki bharatendu harishchandr ke rangandolan ko isi se dasha, disha or prerana mili thi
 The plays which were composed in this early literary endeavor of Bengali were the chronicles or adaptations of the original Sanskrit or English plays
 spasht he ki bharatendu kaa aarmabhik prayaas bhi sanskrit naatakon ke chhayanuwaad kaa hi tha
 The first of the Hindi theatrical literary plays can be called 'inder Sabha' in Hindi Geetinatya Amanat which was played in the court of Nawab Wajid Alishah of Lucknow in 1853 AD
 isamen urdu-style kaa vaisaa hi prayog tha jaisaa parsi naatak mandaliyon ne apane naatakon main apanaaya
 a pure Hindi drama called 'janaki Mangal' was played in Kashi in 1862 AD
 uparyukt saahitiyik rangamanch ke uparyukt chhutput prayaas se bahut aage badhkar parsi mandaliyon-original victoria, ampress victoria, elfinston theetrical company, alfred theetrical tathaa new alfred company aadi-ne vyavsaayik rangamanch banaaya
 Firstly, Bombay and later Hyderabad, Lucknow, Banaras, Delhi, Lahore etc
 These companies started wandering all over the country to perform Hindi plays
 in parsi naatak mandaliyon ke liye pehle-pahal nasarbani khan sahab, raunak banarsi, vinayak prasad ‘talib’, ‘ahasan’ aadi lekhakon ne naatak likhe
 The main objective of these companies was cheap entertainment and earning public
 isi se ucchkoti ke saahitiyik naatakon se inkaa vishesh prayojan nahin tha
 She used to show religious-mythological and love-based plays in her theater
 saste or ashleel pradarshan karne main inhen jaraa bhi sankoch nahin tha
 This is to blame for corrupting people's interest
 bhraman ke kaaran in companiyon kaa rangamanch bhi inke saath ghumta rahata tha
 The establishment of a permanent theater was also not possible through him
 rangamanch kaa dhaanchaa balliyon dwaara nirmit kiya jaataa tha or stage par chitra-vicitra parde lataka die jate the
 His attention was paid to flashy costumes, new paintings of curtains and miraculous scenes
 pardon ko drishyon ke anusaar uthaaya-giraaya jaataa tha
 The musical instrument was organized in the next part of the stage
 gambhir drishyon ke bich-bich main bhi bhadde hasyapurna drishy jaanboojhkar rakhe jate the
 Shayari, ghazals and rhymes used to run a lot in between
 bhashaa urdu-hindi kaa mishrit rup thi
 The dialogues were versatile and rhymed
 radheshyaam kathavachak, narayanprasad betaab, aagaahashr kashmiri, harikrishna johar aadi kuch aise naatakkaar bhi hue hai jinhone parsi rangamanch ko kuch saahitiyik put dekar sudhaarney kaa praytn kiya he or hindi ko is vyavsaayik rangamanch par laane kii cheshtaa kii
 But due to professional instinct, improvisation on this theater was not possible
 isi se in naatakakaron ko bhi vyavsaayik ban janaa padaa
 In this way, the Parsi theater could neither develop nor become permanent
 hindi main naatakon kaa prarambh bharatendu harishchandra se mana jaataa he
 Bharatendu and his contemporary playwrights of that period composed plays for the development of public consciousness, so social problems of that time had a good opportunity to be expressed in plays
 jaisaaki kaha ja chukaa he, hindi main avyavsaayik saahitiyik rangamanch ke nirmaan kaa shriganesh aagaahasan ‘amaanat’ lakhanvi ke ‘inder sabha’ naamak geeti-roopak se mana ja saktaa he
 But the truth is that Inder Sabha was not really a theatrical work
 isamen shaamiyane ke neeche khulaa stage rahata tha
 The audience used to sit like a gimmick on three sides, on one side the seat of King Inder was placed, along with chairs for the fairies
 sazindon ke peeche ek laal rang kaa pardaa lataka diya jaataa tha
 Characters were entered from behind it
 raja inder, pariyaan aadi paatr ek baar aakar vahiin upasthit rahete the
 They did not go back by speaking their dialogues
 us samay natyarangan itnaa lokapriy hua ki amaanat kii ‘inder sabha’ ke anukaran par kai sabhaayen rachi gai, jaise ‘madarilal kii inder sabha’, ‘daryai inder sabha’, ‘hawaii inder sabha’ aadi
 Parsi drama circles also adopted these synagogues and Majlisperistan
 ye rachanaayen naatak nahin thi or na hi inase hindi kaa rangamanch nirmit hua
 That is why Bharatendu Harishchandra used to call them 'natakabhas'
 unhone inaki parody ke rup main ‘bandar sabha’ likhi thi
 The era of Sanskrit plays began to change, then from the fourteenth century to the nineteenth century, they were replaced by folk plays in various Indian languages

 It was initially inhabited by a medieval state called Kyivian Russia but by the 17th century had divided into Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian subcastes
 purvi slaavon ke bare main 859 isvi se pehle ke kaal main zyaada jaankaree nahin he
 The reason for this is that their regions were far from the rest of Europe and there was no written form of their language

 shribhagwat main bharatvarsh kii mahima ke pratipadak aathon shloke devi bhagwat main aksharsh: usee kram main uddhrut hai 
 The difference in the descriptions of the two is so much that where the Srimad Bhagavat takes a natural medium of prose for the sake of the description of the subject, Devi Bhagwat uses the artificial medium of the verse to demonstrate the uniqueness
 shrimadbhagwat bhakthiras tathaa aadhyatmagyaan kaa samanvay upasthit karata he
 The Bhagavata is considered to be the self-sufficiency of Nigamakalpataru, which has been made amritamay by the natural brahmachari and the great scientist Maharishi Shuk, combined with his melodious speech

 bhagwat main dakshin desh ke vaishnav tirthon, nadiyon tathaa parvaton ke vishisht sanket hone se katipay vidvan tamildesh ko iske udai kaa sthaan maanate hai
 There is a substantial difference in the subject of time also
 itnaa nishchit he ki bopadev, mahadev tathaa raja ramchandra ke karnadhipati tathaa mantri, prakhyat dharamshastri hemaadri ne apane 'chaturvarg chintamani' main bhagwat ke anek vachan udhrut kiye hai, bhagwat ke rachayita nahin maane ja sakate
 Shankaracharya's grandfather Guru Gaudapadacharya has quoted two verses of Bhagavat in his 'panchakaranavyakhya', 'jagruhe Paurusam Rupam' and 'shrey: Srutiin Bhakti Mudasya te Vibho' in 'uttaragita Tika'

 Ashtaghapi, Nimbarki, Radhavallabhi poets of Braj Bhasha took radiance and inspiration from Bhagwat, singing Radha Krishna's leelas in Brajbhasha
 mithila ke vidyapati, bengal ke chandidas, gyaandas tathaa govinddas, assam ke shankardev tathaa madhavdev, utkal ke upendra bhanj tathaa dinkrishnadas, maharashtra ke namdev tathaa madhav pandit, gujarat ke narsi mehta tathaa rajasthan kii mirabai - in sabhi santon tathaa kaviyon ne bhagwat ke rasmay varnan se prerana praapt kar radhakrishna kii kamaneey keli kaa gayan apane vibhinn kaavyon main kiya he
 The influence of Bhagwat on the Vaishnava poets of Tamil, Andhra, Kannada and Malayalam is also less
 bhagwat kaa aadhyatmik drushtikon advaitvaad kaa he tathaa sadhanadrushti bhakthi kii he
 Thus the symmetry of devotion with Advaita is Bhagavata's own peculiarity
 inhen kaarnon se bhagwat valmikiy ramayana tathaa mahabharat ke saath sanskrit kii 'upjivy' kavyatrayee ke antarbhoot mana jaataa he
 Bhagwat has 18 thousand verses, 335 chapters and 12 wings

 Raspanchadhyayi spirituality and literature is a unique object in poetry from a different perspective
 venugit, gopigit,, yugalageet, bhramaragit ne bhagwat ko kavy ke udaatt str par pahunchaa diya he
 Following are the 12 skandas of Bhagwat - bhagwat puraana kaa ek prishth Childhood of lord krishna mamblam tamil nadu kii rajdhani chennai kaa ek kshetra he

 Varanasi is often referred to with adjectives like 'city of temples', 'religious capital of India', 'city of Lord Shiva', 'city of lamps', 'city of knowledge'
 prasiddh amareeki lekhak mark twain likhte hai: "banaras itihaas se bhi puraatan he, paramparaon se purana he, kinvadantiyon se bhi pracheen he or jab in sabko ekatra kar den, to us sangrah se bhi doguna pracheen he
 " varanasi naam kaa udgam sambhawatah yahaan kii do sthaneey nadiyon varuna nadi evam asi nadi ke naam se milakar bana he
 These rivers come from the north and south respectively in the Ganges river
 naam kaa ek anya vichaar varuna nadi ke naam se hi aata he jise sambhawatah pracheen kaal main varnasi hi kaha jaataa hoga or isi se shahar ko naam mila
 There may be some early lessons in support of this, but the historians do not consider this second idea to be correct
 lambey kaal se varanasi ko avimukt kshetra, anand-kaanan, mahashmashaan, surandhan, brahmavart, sudarshan, ramya, evam kaashi naam se bhi sambodhit kiya jaataa rahaa he
 The city in the Rigveda is called Kashi or Kasi

 In the Matsya Purana, Shiva describes Varanasi as saying - varanasyaan nadi pu siddhagandharvasevita
 Entry Tripatha Ganga Tasmin Kshetra mam dear yahaan assi kaa kahin ullekh nahin he
 Explaining the expansion of Varanasi region, another place has been said in Matsya Purana- varna c nadi yavadyavachhushkandi tathaa
 6 of Bhishmayandikamambha Parvateshwaramanti uparokt uddharanon se yahi gyaat hota he ki vastav main nagar kaa namakaran varanasi par basane se hua
 The fantasy of settling Varanasi between the eighties and Varuna arose from the time when the city's religious glory rose and at the same time the population in the south of the city came under its limits
 vaise varna shabd ek vriksh kaa bhi naam hota he
 In ancient times, cities used to get names in the name of trees as well, like Kosambi to Kaushambi, Rohit to Rohtik etc
 atah yah sambhav he ki varanasi or varanavati donon kaa hi naam is vriksh vishesh ko lekar hi padaa ho
 For the above reason of the name Varanasi, it should not be inferred that from the above discussion of this city it should not be understood that this capital city of Kashi State had only one name
 akele buddha sahitya main hi iske anek naam milte hai
 Surudhan in Udaya Jataka, Sudarshan in Sutasom Jataka, Brahmavardhana in Somandak Jataka, Pushpavati in Khandhal Jataka, Ramm Nagar in Yuvanjaya Jataka, Molino names in Shankh Jataka

 This city is mentioned in many Hindu texts including Skanda Purana, Ramayana, Mahabharata and the oldest Vedas Rigveda
 saamanyatya varanasi shahar ko lagbhag 3000 varsh pracheen mana jaataa he
 , But according to Hindu traditions, Kashi is considered more ancient than this
 nagar malamal or reshmi kapadon, itron, hathi daant or shilp kala ke liye vyapaarik evam audyogic kendra rahaa he
 During the era of Gautama Buddha, Varanasi used to be the capital of Kashi state
 prasiddh chini yatri hwain tsang ne nagar ko dharmik, shaikshanik evam kalatmak gatividhiyon kaa kendra bataaya he or iskaa vistaar ganga nadi ke kinare 5 kimi tak likhaa he
 Since time immemorial in Kashi, many great personalities have been born or inhabited
 inamen se kuch is prakaar hai: Varanasi became an independent Kashi state in the 18th century and under the later British rule, it remained a major trading and religious center
 1910 main british prashasan ne varanasi ko ek nayaa bhartiya rajya banaaya or ramnagar ko iskaa mukhyalay banaaya, kintu iskaa adhikaar kshetra kuch nahin tha
 The King of Kashi still lives in the Ramnagar Fort

 ise hindu manyata main sabase bada tirth mana jaataa he, kintu tirth ke rup main varanasi kaa sabase purana ullekh mahabharat me miltaa he
 There is no mention of any pilgrimage etc
 in any pre-mahabharata literature
 aaj ke tirthasthal tab adhiktar van pradesh main the or manushyon se rahit the
 The Adivasis must have lived somewhere
 kalantar main tirthon ke bare main kahi gayi kathaayen astitva main aayin or tirth badhate gayi, jinke aasapaas nagar or shahar bhi based
 The existence and significance of pilgrimages was revealed by the spread of Aryans in Bharatbhoomi
 mahabharat main ullekh he prithvi ke kuch sthaan punyaprad tathaa pavitra hote he
 Some of these have become sacred due to the strangeness of the place, some by the influence of birth and some by the contact of sages and sages

 In jabal-upanishad Block-2, Maharishi Atri asked Maharishi Yajnavalkya how to know the latent and eternal God
 tab yajyavlky ne kaha ki us avyakt or anant aatma kii upasna avimukt kshetra main ho sakati he, kyonki vah vahiin pratishthit he
 And on asking the status of Atri's liberation
 yajyavlky ne uttar diya ki vah varna tathaa nashi nadiyon ke madhya main he
 On asking what is that Varana and what is that intoxicant, the answer was received by asking that the sensed being is the varana to remove all the faults and the Indriya is the destroyer of all sins
 vah avimukt kshetra devataaon kaa dev sthaan or sabhi praaniyon kaa brahm sadan he
 It is here that Lord Rudra teaches the Taraka Mantra during the time of human beings' life, due to which he attains salvation by becoming immortal
 at ev avimukt main sadaiv nivas karnaa chahie
 Never leave him, Yajnavalkya has said
 jaabalopinashad ke alaava anek smritiyon jaise likhitasmriti, shringismriti tathaa parasharasmriti, brahmisanhita tathaa sanatkumarasamhita main bhi kaashi kaa mahatmaya bataaya he
 In almost all the Puranas, the greatness of Kashi has been said
 brahmavaivart puraana main to kaashi kshetra par kaashi-rahasy naam se puraa granth hi he, jise uskaa khil bhaag kehete hai
 In Padma Purana, kashi-mahatmya and other places also mention Kashi
 pracheen ling puraana main solah adhyay kaashi kii tirthon ke sambandh main the
 There is also a chapter in the current Lingpurana
 skanda puraana kaa kashikhand to kaashi ke tirth-swarup kaa vivechan tathaa vistrut varnan karata hi he
 Thus there is material on religious significance of Kashi in Purana literature
 iske atirikt, sanskrit-vadmay, dashakumarcharit, naishadh, rajtarangini or kuttanipatam main bhi kaashi kaa varnan aata he
 The Linga Purana, which took place till the 12th century AD, had detailed descriptions of the deviyanas and pilgrimages of Kashi from the third to the eighteenth chapter
 tristhalisetu granth kii rachana main lingapurana vaisaa hi rahaa tha
 That is, in the Lingpurana also, the lingo is described from the third to the sixteenth chapter
 vartmaan ling puraana main keval ek hi adhyay kaashi ke vishay main he, jisamen keval 144 shloke hai
 Thus, if all the Puranas are mentioned except Mahabharata, then the list of mention of Kashi's pilgrimage form becomes very long

 puraanon main aayi varanasi kii seemaa rajghat kii ukt lambaai-chaudaai se kahin adhik he
 From those accounts, it seems that not only the boundary of the city is described, but the entire region has been included
 varuna ke us paar tak pracheen basaavaton ke avshesh kaaphi dur tak milte hai
