 The rifle faced a lot of problems in the initial stages of production, the first models it encountered were the receivers of the stamped metal sheet, its guides and ejector trail were also difficult to weld, due to which it got bigger The scale had to be rejected but instead of stopping production, a heavy mechanical receiver was put in it
 It was a costly solution but after doing it the product The speed of the day was increased, then no new mechanical revavers were being installed, only the receivers of the earlier Mosin Nagat rifles were being used, due to this problem, these rifles could not be distributed in mass in the Soviet Army until 1956
 , And during this time only SKS Rifle was given to the army, Once the production problem was resolved, a new model was started to be given to the AKM army
this new model was equipped with a stamped sheet metal receiver
 It also had a hammer marker so that a limited number of rounds could be run while the automatic shot was fired, and the weapon would not suffer any damage, it is also called round redioser
 The new model was 1 / 3 less heavy than the old model
 This model is the most popular today and its production has been the highest till date, although generally this distinction is not known to Kisii

 kavy main ek prakaar kaa shabd dosha
 When there is more use of such rural words in poetry, which are practiced only in a particular area, the use of such words is considered as a rural defect in the poem

 Isik Kul province is named after the famous Isik Kul lake

 In the northern part of Isik Kul province there is an eye-shaped Isik Kul lake which is surrounded by the high hills of Tian Shan on every side

 Nevertheless it is the specialty of Isik Kul Lake that it never freezes and 'isik Kul' also means 'hot lake' in Kyrgyz language

 In today's scientific age, no country can live separately
 in deshon main parsparik sambandh jodna aaj ke yug main aavashyak ho gaya he
 Qualified individuals are sent from one country to another to connect these relations
 ye vyakti apni yogyata, kushalta or kootneeti se duusare desh ko praayah mitra bana lete hai
 Even in ancient times, one state used to send its diplomats to connect diplomatic relations with another state
 pehle kootneeti kaa arth 'saude main yaa len dein main vaakya chaaturi, chal-prapanch, dhokhaa-dhadi' lagaaya jaataa tha
 a person who used to get maximum benefits for his country by paying a lower price was called a skilled diplomat
 parantu aaj chal-prapanch ko kootneeti nahin kaha jaataa he
 Scientifically, in modern times the term is used for peaceful settlement in two states
 diplomasi ke liye hindi main kootneeti ke sthaan par rajnay shabd kaa prayog hone laga he
 The international world has become like a family
 parivaar ke sadasyon main prem, sahyog, sadbhaavna tathaa mitrataa kaa sambandh jodna ek kushal rajanyajna kaa kaam he
 The word 'rajnay' is a Hindi translation of the English word 'diplomacy'
 diplomasi shabd kii utpatti greek bhashaa ke diploun shabd se hui he jiskaa arth modana athwa doharaa karnaa he
 The Roman Empire developed after the fall of the Greek states
 roman samrajya main passport evam sadakon par chalane ke anumati patr aadi dohare karke sil diye jate the
 These passports and permission cards were inscribed on metal letters
 inako 'diploma' kaha jaataa tha
 Gradually, the term diploma was used for all government papers
 videshiyon ke visheshadhikaar athwa unmukti evam videshi sandhiyon sambandhi kagajaat bhi 'diploma' kahe jane lage
 When the number of these treaties became more, they were kept in safe places
 ye sthaan baad main 'rajkeey abhilekhagaaron' ke naam se jane gayi
 As the number of diplomats of the coronation offices increased, they were recruited and separately appointed to look after them and take care of them
 in karmchaariyon kaa kaary rajanyik krity kaha gaya
 Gradually, the term diplomacy started being used for this business
 rajnay shabd kaa prayog vichaarkon dwaara anek arthon main kiya gaya he
 According to Herald Nicholson, it is sometimes used as a synonym for foreign policy, such as Indian diplomacy was not successful in neighboring countries
 kabhi is shabd dwaara sandhi vaarta ko ingit kiya jaataa he, jaise is samasya ko rajnay dwaara suljhaayaa ja saktaa he
 The diplomatic treaty also indicates the process and mechanism of negotiation
 kabhi-kabhi videsh seva kii ek shakha ko rajnay kah diya jaataa he
 Diplomacy is also considered to be the intangible quality or skill of negotiating an international treaty
 iskaa sabase dooshit prayog vah he jab ise ek kapattapurna kaary arth main liya jaataa he
 Thus, due to the use of the word diplomacy in various meanings, it creates confusion in the mind of the reader
 shaayad raajnneeti shaastra main yah shabd sabase adhik bhram utpann karne vaala he
 In this subject, Argensky has said that qualities like 'skill, cleverness and deceit' can be signs of good diplomacy, but they cannot be called characteristics that define diplomacy
 rajnay videsh niti ke samakaksh bhi nahin
 It is such a part of foreign policy that contributes actively to its creation and implementation
 ' According to Argensky- sar arnest santon ke anusaar, In this regard, Palmer and Perkins have expressed a curiosity that if there is a lack of intelligence and tact in the mutual relations of states, would diplomacy be impossible? It is clear that diplomacy is a relationship between two or more independent states, accordingly each state uses intelligence, skill and tact
 ke0em0 panikkar ke shabdon main, Quincy Wright has defined diplomacy in two ways - in the popular sense and in the special sense
 lokapriy arth main - The special point of this definition is that diplomacy in the popular sense has been considered a treaty that is based on persuasion rather than pressure
 iske vishesh arth main rajanyagnon ko rashtriya hit ke prati bhakthipurna mana gaya he
 Popular meaning of diplomacy does not apply in political science
 anterrashtriya sambandhon main rajnay keval vahi kaary karata he jahaan dabaav kii sambhaavnaayen rahati hai
 These possibilities are suppressed by diplomacy
 rajnay kaa uddeshy samjhaute karnaa he or samjhaute keval vahiin kiye jate hai jahaan kuch asahmatiyaan hon
 These disagreements should be such that negotiations can be agreed
 purna sahmati ke kshetron main rajnay apraasangik he tathaa purna asahmati ke kshetron main yah prabhaavaheen he
 According to Roberto Regella, the word diplomacy has been misused
 asal main rajnay ek aisa vyavsaay he jisamen anek kriyaayen shaamil ho jaati hai
 It is one of the few professions in the world that covers every branch of human activity in its periphery
 iskaa sambandh shakti raajnneeti aarthik shakti evam vichaardhaaraon ke sangharsh se he
 Regella considers diplomacy to be the 'art of negotiation'
 1796 main edmand bark ne rajnay kii paribhaasha dete hue likhaa tha ki rajnay anterrashtriya sambandhon kaa parichaalan athwa sanchaalan he
 George F
 Cannon states that in the technical sense diplomacy can be arranged as a link between governments
 is prakaar vibhinn vichaarkon ne rajnay kii vibhinn paribhaashayen di hai
 All these definitions are not entirely appropriate as the meaning of diplomacy changes as time and circumstances change
 anek vichaarkon ne rajnay ko keval ek vyavsaay hi nahin varan ek kala bhi mana he
 Most governments have started adopting it for the attainment and growth of their interests
 yah dhire-dhire shaanti kaa ek prabhaavshaalee saadhan banataa ja rahaa he
 Initially the states were full of unlimited powers and as a result, diplomats were considered sovereign
 unhen kaary karne kii paryaapt swatantraaa saunpi jaati thi
 Another reason for this freedom was that there was a lack of rapid means of communication at that time
 19veen shatabdi ke uttararddh main rajanyikon kii yah vyapak swatantraaa simit hone lagi
 Another feature of diplomacy at that time was also that diplomats were sent only by giving orders and instructions related to their work
 aajkal sanchaar ke tivrgami sadhano kii suvidha ke kaaran yah aavashyak nahin rahaa he
 Some people consider diplomacy to be a mysterious business
 yah sahi nahin he
 According to Hudh Gibson, "in fact, diplomacy is an illusionary business
 yah jaadu athwa rahasy se pare he
 It can be seen as a serious business like any other government function
 paamar tathaa parickens ne rajnay kii kuch visheshtaon kaa varnan kiya he
 These features will prove useful to explain the nature of diplomacy
 ye visheshtayen nimnlikhit hai :- Nicholson is not right to say that diplomatic work ceases when the war begins, as Palmer and Perkins think diplomats work to protect the country
 atah yuddh ke samay haath par haath dhar kar nahin baithte hai, balki us samay ve sainik kaaryon main sahyog dete hai
 In this way, the work of diplomats does not stop during the war, but the form of their work changes
 yuddh kaal main rajnay kaa kaary adhik bad jaataa he
 This is clear from the observation of the events of the last two World Wars
 rajnay kaa swaroop samajhane ke liye yah upyogi he ki videsh niti, anterrashtriya kanoon evam rajanyik raajnneeti se uske sambandh tathaa antar kaa adhyayan kiya jaye
 Dynasties and states of ancient India have a long tradition of diplomacy

 isamen rajnay ke siddhant bhi hai, jisamen bataaya he ki paraspar spardhi rajyon ke bich kis prakaar budhimaan raja gathjod banaae or apane shatruon ko gatirodh main daale
 At that time the messengers sent to the courts stopped for a long time
 arthshaastra main duuton ke saath vyavhaar sambandhi nirdesh hai
 It is said that the greatest morality for a king is that his kingdom attains prosperity etc

 It can be internal or external
 aantarik niti grih-kaaryon se sambandhit hoti he jabaki videsh niti raashtra kii bahari vyavasthaaon sein
 Foreign policy and diplomacy are the wheels of politics with the help of which international politics operates
 kisi raashtra dwaara anya rajyon ke sandarbh main apane dhyeyon kii purti hi videsh niti he
 It is impossible to think of a foreign policy that ignores national interest
 atah videsh niti kaa arth rajya ke us vyavhaar ke rup main liya jaataa he jiske madhyam se rajya apane hiton kii purti karte hai
 In the ancient era, a state can remain separate by adopting a policy of isolation in itself, it is impossible
 videsh niti kaa nirmaan bahut soch samaj kar kiya jaataa he kyonki isi ke sahi nirnay par hi rajya kaa bhavishya nirbhar karata he
 The state has to take many elements into consideration in the formulation of foreign policy
 udaahranarth, britain va japan kii videsh niti apni bhugolic sthiti se gahare rup se prabhavit rahi he
 The natural resources of the states or their strategic importance etc
 affect the foreign policy of the state
 aviksit rajya, jo vibhinn shaktiyon se sahaayta praapt karte rahete hai tathaa unheen par nirbhar rahete hai, kabhi bhi swatantra videsh niti kaa nirmaan nahin kar sakate hai
 The military power of a country makes its foreign policy enthusiastic and leads it on the wrong path
 germany, italy or japan ne sainik shakti ke kaaran hi apane padosi rajyon par hamalaa kiya or vishwa yuddh kaa aahvaan kiya
 The politics of the states and their foreign policy are created by the politicians of the country, then the ambassadors implement it
 videshniti ke nirdhaaran main rajyon ko rashtriya va anterrashtriya paristhitiyon ke kai drushtikonon ke dhyaan main rakhana padataa he
 Such as the geographical location of the state, economic requirements, natural resources, defense requirements and treaties etc

 Relations between states often deteriorate with regard to the boundary question
 bharat-pakistan, bharat-china, rus-china aadi deshon ke madhya yuddh athwa yuddh kii sthiti aati rahi he
 Foreign policy decisions are also taken in the context of the economic condition of the states, trade and commerce etc
 satta kii prapti ke prayaason main rajya kabhi-kabhi apane swatantra nirnay ke adhikaar kho baithte hai
 The decisions of the foreign policy of the state decide on its strategic position and military power
 rajya jitna adhik shashakt hoga utani hi safal uskaa rajnay hoga
 According to Fredrik the Great, "shakti without diplomacy is the same as music without music
" “ sanyukt rajya america kaa rajnay uski shakti ke kaaran hi safal he
 If a state is weak, it invites other states to intervene or attack in that country
 poland ke vibhaajan, italy kaa europe kii ransthali bananaa, hitler dwaara austria tathaa chacoslovekia kaa vilay tathaa china kaa bharat par akraman, rajyon ke shaktiheen hone ke kaaran hi sambhav hua he
 After the policy makers have set their objectives, the question of achieving these objectives comes before the state and this is the effect of diplomacy
 videsh niti ke kshetra main rajya sakriy athwa niskriy ho saktaa he
 If the state is active then the state has four options, on the basis of which it works - political, economic, psychological and military
 samay or paristhitinusaar rajya iname se koi bhi ek vikalp apana saktaa he athwa iske sammilit rup kaa bhi prayog kar saktaa he
 Inactivity can prove fatal for any state in the current international situation
 rajya praayah rajnay ke maarg kaa hi upyog karte hai
 The purpose of foreign policy is to make the more intensified and hostile side of relations with friendly states inactive
 rajnay vah saadhan he jo vaarta or chaturata se is uddashya kii prapti main sahaayak hota he
 It is the highest and important means of achieving the objectives of foreign policy
 vastav main videsh niti hi rajnay kaa kaushal he
 The making of any foreign policy is the work of these officials, the same in the context of other countries, the implementation of the ambassadors
 aaj ke is jatil yug main takneekee kii drushti se bhale hi videsh vibhaag akelaa hi videsh niti kaa nirmaataa mana jaataa ho, parantu is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa ki rajdoot bhi iske nirmaan main mahatvapurn yogadan dete hai
 The ambassador's activities are based on his country's foreign policy
 yadhyapi yah satya he ki rajdoot iske sanchaalan main swatantra nahin hote
 Foreign policy and diplomacy are not synonymous with each other
 kuch vidwaan inkaa ek-duusare ke sthaan par bandhan mukt prayog karte hai
 There is enough difference among them
 videsh niti main rashtron ke hiton kii raksha, unke madhya sambandhon kii sthapana tathaa inhen banaaye rakhane ke prayaas sammilit hai
 According to JR Childs, "the foreign policy of a country is the essence of its foreign relations" while "diplomacy is the process with which foreign policy can be implemented
" ” sar charlas vaxtor ke shabdon main, “niti kii sabase adhik dharanayen bhi vyarth hai yadi unako kriya rup main parivartit karne ke saadhan nahin hon
 "this work is done by diplomacy rajyon ke madhy rajanyik sambandh ati pracheen kaal se chale aa rahe hai
 They are as ancient as the state
 yunaan, rome va pracheen bharat main rajanyik sambandh ati vyapak the tathaa in sambandhon ko nirdhaarit karne vaale niyam bhi pratipaadit kiye ja chuke the
 Old diplomacy does not mean ancient diplomacy at all
 iskaa taatpary solahavin or satrahavin shatabdi main europe main prachlit rajnay se he
 The whole of Europe was accepted by Richelieu and the diplomacy interpreted by Calyars, which is called the old diplomacy
 yah rajnay atharahavin shatabdi tak gopneeyata ke aadhaar par safaltaapurvak chalata rahaa
 The diplomacy before 1919 was old diplomacy
 1815 kii vienna kii sandhi or 1914 ke pratham vishwayuddh ke bich kaa kaal pratishthit rajnay kaa swarnakaal tha
 It was bound by certain rules
 is samay kaa rajnay shishtataa, anubhav evam vastusthit par aadhaarit tha
 It believed trust, clarity and reality to be the basis of successful diplomacy
 vaartaayen gupt rup se hoti thim
 Traffic and suspicion: Due to lack of proper development of vehicle tools, the speed of the royalty process was slow

 When there was a deadlock in this, they were postponed for a short time, and they were turned on again when the favorable time and situation occurred
 logon ko kanonkan khabar nahin milti thi
 In 1907 the anglo-ration Convention negotiations lasted for fifteen months
 1918 ke baad rajnay kaa jo nayaa swaroop hamaare samaksh aayaa use 'naveen rajnay' kii sangya di jaati thi
 Although the situation of diplomacy changed in 1919, the year 1919 is not really a dividing line
 nickelson ke anusaar keval itnaa hi hua he ki rajnay ne nayi badalati hui paristhitiyon ke anusaar apane aapako badal liya he
 Jules Camban was also of the opinion that the distinction between old and new diplomacy is illusion
 regala kaa to yahaan tak mat he ki bhale hi kaary karne kii vidhi main parivartan aayaa ho, parantu aadhunik naveen rajnay abhi bhi puraane rajnay ke kai gunon ko apanaaye hue hai
 Diplomacy is a constantly dynamic system
 iske aaj ke vichaar tathaa siddhanton kaa aadhaar sainkadon varshon kaa anubhav he
 Those who bitterly criticized the old diplomacy and accepted the new system, as President Wilson did, also had to revisit the old system shortly
 khule rajnay ke is yug main sandhi vaartaayen aaj bhi gupt chalati hai
 Even after writing all this, it cannot be denied that although the dividing line can be drawn between the means of diplomacy used by Telerin and Bismarck and Kissinger, there have been revolutionary changes in diplomatic ideology
 aaj rajnay kuch gine chune vyaktiyon raja-maharaajaaon athwa unke priy paatro dwaara sanchalit na hokar janata tathaa unke pratinidhiyon dwaara chalaaya jaataa he
 Colleges have been opened in different countries to teach diplomacy

 God is the supreme supernatural power that is considered the creator and ruler of this world
 hindi main parameshwar ko bhagwaan, paramatma yaa parameshwar bhi kehete hai
 In most religions, the concept of God is associated with the structure of the universe
 sanskrit kii ish dhaatu kaa arth he- niyantrit karnaa or is par varach pratyay lagaakar yah shabd bana he
 Thus, in its original form the word is used as niyanta
 isi dhaatu se samanaarthi shabd ish va isheita bane hai
 God is three in one as well as one in three - God the Father, God the Messiah and the Holy Spirit
 wo ishwar ko allaah kehete hai
 The religious book of the religion of Islam is the Quran and every Muslim believes in the power of God
 islam kaa mul mantra "lau ilaah ill, allaah, mohammad ur rasul allaah" he,arthath allaah ke sivaa koi mabood nahi he or mohammad unke aakhri rasul hai
 Islam Wahid is a religion that is based on truth
 islam dharm me baaki dharmo se zyaada pakizgi bataai gai he
 According to the Holy Quran, there is a God and the name of that one God is only Allah
 isliye agar koi puche ki ishwar ek he or vah koun he to quran ke hisaab se ek hi sateek jawaab miltaa he ki ishwar sirf or sirf allaah he jiske 99 naam hai
 In Islam, Muslims are not allowed to urinate in the open, because this makes human being unclean and the prayer is not worth reading, so in Islam, they have been asked to urinate while sitting and after that they have been allowed to wash the shame
 islam me 5 vaqt kii namaaz muqarrar kii gai he or har namr farz he
 Ramadan is a culinary month in Islam that lasts for 30 days and it is permissible to keep it daily for 30 days, which is 12 or more than 12 years old

 According to the Vedas, the person within the person is God
 parameshwar ek hi he
 There is a profound difference in the concept of God in Vedic and Western views that according to the Vedas, God is both within and beyond, whereas according to Western religions, God is only beyond
 ishwar parabrahm kaa sagun rup he
 Vaishnavites consider Vishnu as God, and Saiva as Shiva

 But no one can give a firm argument on whether God is there or not
 bhartiya darshanon main "ishwar" ke vishay main kya kaha gaya he, vah nimnavat he- Some commentators of this philosophy have denied the authority of God
 unka tark he- ishwar chetan he, atah is jad jagat kaa kaaran nahin ho saktaa
 Again the power of God cannot be proved by any proof
 Either God is not free and omnipotent, or he is not benevolent and merciful, otherwise why would he create this world full of sorrow, mourning, Vaishmayadi? If God is governed by karmic theory, then it is not free and if not following the principle of karmic theory, creationism cannot be proved
 purush or prakruti ke atirikt kisi ishwar kii kalpana karnaa yuktiyukt nahin he
 Although both Samkhya and Yoga are complementary philosophies, Yogadarshan accepts the authority of God
 patanjali ne ishwar kaa lakshan bataaya he- "kleshkarmavipakarashayaraparamrishtah purushavisheshah ishwarh" arthath klesh, karm, vipaak or aashay se sarvatha asprisht purush-vishesh ishwar he
 This yoga-propounded God is a special man; He is not the doer, dharta, samharta, controller of the world

 Their migration is as regular and gradual as that of the seasons, and it has elicited curiosity and curiosity in humans since ages, even as the Red Indians have named their calendar months after the arrival of migrating birds
 chidiyon ke pravrajan ke vishay ke maanya pandit landsbaro tomson ne pravrajan kii vyakhya is prakaar kii he: Long ago, it was believed that as some mammals and mammals go into dormancy to avoid frost in the autumn, in the same way that ababil, calvinka and cuckoo also cool
 aisi dharna arestu ke samay se hi chali aa rahi thi
 The ability to move in birds has developed immensely due to the thermal power, wings and amazing power of flight

 Through migration, sparrows also get two favorable areas in two adverse seasons
 ek kshetra main ve nivas karti hai or prajnan karti he or duusare kshetra main bhojan tathaa vishram ke hetu jaati hai
 It is a law of nature that birds lay eggs only in the cold part of the migration zone

 Often the migration is from north to south, although some migration is also from east to west
 pravrajan kuch kilometre se lekar hajaaron kilometre tak kaa hota he, jaise kuch chidiyaan himalay kii adhik oonchaai se utarkar uttari bharat ke samtal bhaagon main chali aati hai or kuch hajaaron kilometre sudur dakshin main chali jaati hai
 The most distant migration is done by the North Polar Kurri

 It travels southward during the winter of the Arctic, crossing the world and returning to the South Pole Antarctic after spending the summer
 is prakaar jane or aane kii ek ore kii yatra main lagbhag 17,742 kilometre kii duuri tay karti he
 Several theories have been proposed regarding the onset of migration in sparrows
 pravrajan se chidiyon ko nimnlikhit laabh hote hai : The migration of sparrows depends on both internal and external stimuli of the bird
 prayogon se prakat hota he ki bahya uttejnaaon main se din kii avadhi main parivartan pramukh he ; ant : uttejnaa prajnanaangon se utpann hormone dwaara praapt hoti he
 Many experiments and observations of how the target destination of migration is determined and how the birds find their way to this destination have not yet received a satisfactory answer
 sharatkaleen awasakshetra main sharad ritu bitaane ke pashchaat vasant ritu main prajnan kshetra athwa greeshm-awaas-kshetra main vayask naron kaa pratham punaragaman hota he
 This is followed by adult females and finally by the minor sparrows
 kintu sharad main yah kram ulat jaataa he
 First minor birds and females depart for the southern journey and later adult males
 dakshin kii yatra bade itaminaan se or sthaan sthaan par ruk rukkar hoti he
 Young children or teenagers, who are only a few months old, guide the convoy and adults follow them later
 yah kaise hota he? isaki anek vyakhyaayein kii gai hai
 The more accepted opinion among them is that due to the migration of many generations every year, birds have to create a special kind of neem according to the caste tradition, without any prior experience, at the right time, without any prior experience
 Migration of experience has also become an inborn quality
 pakshi sudur pradeshon ke raste kaa kis prakaar pataa lagaate hai? iske vishay main bhi anek anumaan hai jinamein se kuch prithvi ke chumbakatv ke prati sookshm samvedansheeltaa, sthalchihron kii drushti dwaara pahchaan ityadi hai
 But foreseeing, the determination of the distant destination and its path in yesterday's birds remains mysterious
 jis prakaar manushya sudur kii yatra kar phir apane ghar ko laut aata he, thik usee bhanti pakshi hajaaron kilometre kii yatra kar or sharad ritu kisi sudur sthaan main vyateet kar na keval apane greeshm-nivas-kshetra main hi pahunch jate hai, balki apane tyakt ghonsle main bhi pahunch jate hai
 It has been established by the method of ringing the birds that in Europe, the abbeel often reaches not only the same settlement, but the same house to which she left and went on a distant journey
 ababilein is yatra main 9,677 kilometre kii duuri tay karti hai
 The same thing is found in other real migrating birds
 anek varshon ke nirikshan ke falswaroop prakashit kuch gyaat tathyon se pataa chalata he ki chidiyaan na keval apane nivaskshetra or puraane need main hi pahunch jaati he, balki thik usee din lautakar aa jaati hai jis din ve pichley varsh main lautakar ai thim
 Therefore, when traveling for such a long time, it is even more amazing that the birds return to their nests at a certain time
 bharat ke vibhinn kshetron main sharad main aagaman karanevaale prayek sharadyatri pakshi kii sthiti bhinn hoti he
 Take for example any location, such as the Bhopal region of central India

 Some of these travelers are left behind and can be seen in Bhopal throughout the autumn

 They again appear in early summer, when they return to the north
 ye sharad or vasant main pravrajan karanevaale yatri hote hai
 Some are visible in the autumn, when traveling south, but not visible when they return to their residence again in the spring, because they return via another route

 Like real migrating birds, these also have a gradual and regular migration

 Apart from this, there is another type of translocation which happens due to local conditions affecting the diet, such as heat, drought or flood, etc
, or a particular type of flowering and ripening season
 us samay chidiyaan ek kshetra se duusare kshetra main chali jaati hai
 Sometimes sparrows are also found traveling to other areas in search of food, leaving them in their proper habitat, bound by extraordinary circumstances

 When a large number of such types of tables are assembled, then these tables are analyzed and based on them, the path of migration of a particular species of bird or any other problem is determined

 Inter-abdominal vision cholecystectomy has now replaced open gallbladder healing as the first choice of treatment for gallstones and treatment for gall bladder inflammation, unless dieting in the intra-abdominal vision approach
 Occasionally, an intra-abdominal vision gall bladder is converted to open cholecystectomy for technical reasons or for safety

 hakhaamani vansh yaa ajamidh samrajya pracheen iran kaa ek shaasha vansh tha
 It was the first ruling dynasty in the known history of ancient Iran to have acquired sovereignty over almost the whole of present-day Iran and moreover, during its peak it ran from Greece in the west to the Indus River in the east and from the Caspian Sea in the north to the south
 Had spread to the Arabian Sea
 itnaa bada samrajya iske baad bas saasaani shaasha hi sthapit kar paae the
 The decline of this dynasty occurred in AD 330 BC after the invasion of Alexander, after which Greek dominion was established over its territories
 pashchim main is samrajya ko misr evam babylon par adhikaar, yunaan ke saath yuddh tathaa yahudiyon ke mandir nirmaan main sahyog ke liye yaad kiya jaataa he
 Kurosh and Darush are also referred to as the great noun in history
 is vansh ko aadhunik farsi bhashaa bolne vaale iraniyon kii samskruti kaa aadhaar kaha jaataa he
 Iran sees this empire of ancient Iran as his glorious past, before the Arabs established rule and influence over Iran
 aaj bhi irani apane naam is kaal ke shaskaon ke naam par rakhte hai jo muslim naam nahin maane jate hai
 This dynasty is also considered a symbol of the royal form of Zoroastrianism due to the influence of Zardoshta
 teesri sadi main sthapit saasaani vansh ke shaskaon ne apana mul hakhaamani vansh ko hi bataaya tha
 According to Shrimad Bhagwat and Vishnu Purana, the entire Kurukshetra is known as Kuru Raja in the generation of King Ajmiad of Brahma's lineage
 kuru ek atyant pratapi raja hue hai jo mahabharat main kauravon ke pitamah the, unhi ke naam se kuru pracheen bharat ke 16 mahajanapadon main se ek tha
 Its area was around modern Haryana
 isaki rajdhani sambhawatah hastinapur yaa indraprastha thi
 The extent of the expansion of the kingdom of Kuru must have been a matter of discovery for Indians, but in world history, Kuru was the Chakravarti king who gave new dimensions to the largest empire of the ancient world, transferring the Med empire in Iran from his own maternal grandfather Astyagus
 The empire was renamed Ajmeedh Achaemenid_empire empire
 is samrajya kii simaayen bharat se mishra, libya or greek tak faili hui thi
 The ruler of the Hakhamani i
e
 Hakhamanash dynasty was the ruler of a small state called Anshan from the seventh century onwards centered in modern Southwestern Iran's Pars province
 jis samay hakhaamani yaa ajamidh shaskaon ne satta samhaali, us samay midi log iran main sabase zyada shaktishaalee the
 Anshan i
e
 Pars i
e
 the kingdom of Persia was his associate
 ye log asyria ke khilaaf yuddh karte the
 When Kuru became hereditary king of Anshan in 559 BCE, he refused to accept the Mead dominance and revolted against the Mead empire
 usne isapurv 549 main maid raja astyagas kii rajdhani hamaadaan par adhikaar kar liya
 He declared himself the King of Paras and made the Mead Empire his ally
 isse midia or faras ke rishte puri tarah badal gaye or faras uske baad aane vaali sadiyon ke liye irani prabhusatta kaa kendra ban gaya
 It is said that Kurosh was a grandson in the relationship of media king Astyagas
 hakhaamani vansh main raajaaon ke bich pita-putr jaise rishte kaa hameshaa na mil paanaa itihaaskaaron main matbhed paidaa karata he After this ruling, in contrast to what happened to the kings of western Iran at the time - Kuru did not even accept the subjugation or Barabari of the remaining small kingdoms and the empire began to expand
 usne pashchim kii disha main ledia par adhikaar kar liya
 There he also looted the wealth of the famous Croesus for his treasures
 iske alaava asia miner ke ilaakon par or babylonia par bhi usne adhikaar kar liya
 Kurosh gave religious freedom to the Jews
 lekin kuru kii mrityu uske jivan itani garimamayi nahin rahi
 In the latter part of his life, when he returned from the western side of the Caspian Sea and set out for a victory expedition, he was defeated and killed by the queen of Messagete there
 lekin us samay tak kurosh ne ek vishaal samrajya khadaa kar diya tha
 From the Greek cities to the Caspian Sea in the Middle East and along the coast of Turkey, hardly anyone in the world has stood up to that time
 vah vishwa kaa pehla samraat rahaa hoga jise mahaan kii oopaadhi di gai hogi - kurosh mahaan
 After Qurosh, his son became Kambojia Shah
 usne misr main apni vijay pataakaa laharaayi or wo apni krurta ke liye vikhyath tha
 He died unexpectedly
 kaha jaataa he ki farsi kshetra ke kendra main kisi vidroh kii khabar ko sunakar usne aatm hatya kar lee
 An inscription found near Bisitun in western Iran states that a Magi named Gaumata revolted
 usne apane ko kambojia kaa chota bhai bataakar farsi janata par pade karon ke khilaaf logon ko bhadakaayaa tha
 It was true that during the time of Kurosh and Kambojia, the Iranian people had fought a lot of battles and the expenditure came from taxes imposed on the people
 par iske kuch hi dinon baat daara ne gaumata ko maar diya or shah ban baitha
 He later inscribed the events of those days in Bisitun
 daara ajamidh samrajya shaasha vansh se kisi dur ke rishte se judaa hua tha
 As soon as the throne was over, Dara began to expand his empire towards the west
 par 490 isapurv main marathon ke yuddh yawanon se mili paraajay ke baad use waapas asia mainar tak simat kar rah janaa padaa
 Persepolis was built during the reign of Dara
 ekbatanaa ko bhi grishm rajdhani ke rup main viksit kiya gaya
 After this, his son Khashirshah launched a conquest of Greece
 lagbhag bees lakh kii sena lekar usne yavan pradeshon par dhaava bol diya
 He attacked from the north and there was no significant military opposition in Macedonia and Thesele
 wo aage badhata gaya par thermopaile ke yuddh main use ek choti si sena ne teen dinon tak roak diya
 After this, he was also defeated by the Yavan in some places
 maikale ke yuddh main haarane ke baad farsi sena waapas aa gai
 Even after this, there was a Persian influence on Macedon
 uske qareeb sau saal baad, mesidonia kaa raja philip vahaan ke chote chote samrajyon ko sangathit karne main safal hua
 But he was murdered
 us samay uskaa betaa sikandar kaachhi chota tha
 But Alexander dreamed of world victory
 wo sabase pehle yunaan par farsi daman kaa badla lenaa chahta tha
 With this intention, he launched an attack on the coastal regions of Anatolia
 sikandar kii sena ko jeet milti gai
 Now Alexander entered Turkey directly
 isapurv san 330 main usne daara tritiy ko ek yuddh main haraa diya
 But the kingdom of Dara had become very large by that time and Alexander's victory with a defeat cannot be assured
 par sikandar ne daara ko teen alag alag yudhon main haraaya
 Dara fled the battlefield and the Yavans took control of the Persian army
 iske baad sikandar ne daara ko pakadaney kii koshish kii par iskaa use sidhaa phayda nahin mila
 a few days later Alexander's body was found by Alexander
 daara ko uske hi aadamiyon ne maar diya tha
 With this the Hakhamani empire collapsed
 sikandar kaa samrajya puure farsi samrajya ko nigal chukaa tha
 Ajmid Empire was perhaps the largest empire in the world at that time
 isaki mahanata kaa gungan unani granthon main bhi miltaa he
 In 1971, the Shah of Iran organized a special event to complete 2500 years of the founding of the Ajmid Empire
 yah percepolis tathaa pasargade ke aitihaasik sthal par yojit kiya gaya tha jisamen kai rashtradhyakshon ko aamantrit kiya gaya tha or karondon rupayon kaa kharch aayaa tha
 At that time there was a famine in some parts of Iran and the Iranian people had turned against spending so much money at that time
 yah prakaran bhi iran kii islamic kranti ke sabase pramukh kaarnon main se ek tha
 Yosa Busson or Taniguchi Busson was a Japanese haiku poet and painter, commonly known as Busson

 550–486 BCE) was the famous ruler of the Hakhamani dynasty of ancient Iran, known in history for its religious tolerance and its inscriptions
 vah farsi samrajya ke sansthaapak kurosh ke baad hakhaamani vansh kaa sabase prabhaavshaalee shaasha mana jaataa he
 After the death of Kambojia, a Magi named Bardiya claimed the throne
 chah anya rajpariwaron ke saath milakar usne baradiya ko maar daalaa or iske baad uskaa rajtilak hua
 He had an inscription excavated at Bisitun in western Iran during his reign, which is considered an important document in the history of ancient Iran
 uske shashan kaal main hakhaamani samrajya misr se sindhu nadi tak fail gaya tha
 He annexed Greece and also fought the Shakas in the north
 usne itane bade samrajya main ek samaan mudra chalaai or aramike ko rajbhasha qaraar diya
 He also started important construction works at places such as Perselolis and Pasaragade, which remained the hallmark of Hakhamani architecture for centuries

 He initially faced tremendous rebels
 vidrohiyon main sabase prabal gaumata naam kaa vyakti tha, jisane iran ke singhaasana par adhikaar kar liya tha
 But Dara's helpers soon ended up killing Gaumata
 parashia ke anek praanton ne bhi daara ke khilaaf vidroh kar swatantra hone kaa praytn kiya
 There were rebellions in Elam, Babylonia, Media, Armenia, Lydia, and even Egypt and Persia
 lekin saahsee or pratibhashali daara ne samast vidrohiyon ko kuchalakar parsik samrajya ko pun: sudrudh kar diya
 It took him nearly three years to quell the rebellion; After this peace was established in the vast empire of Persia

 After capturing the city of Mylatus, the center of the rebellion, all the men there were slaughtered by the Iranians and took women and children captive
 asia miner ke unaniyon ko athens ke unaniyon ne vidroh ke liy bhadakaayaa tha
 Hence BC In 490, Dara invaded Greece with a large army to demolish Athens
