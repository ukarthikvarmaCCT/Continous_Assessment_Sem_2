 The legend of Nal and Damayanti appears in the epic of India, the Mahabharata
 yudhisthir ko jue main apana sab-kuch ganvaa kar apane bhaaiyon ke saath vanvaas karnaa padaa
 At the same time, a sage told him the story of Nal and Damayanti
 nal nishadh desh ke raja the
 He was the son of Veersen
 nal bade vir the or sundar bhi
 He was proficient in armaments and horse-handling
 damyanti vidarbha naresh kii ekmaatr putree thi
 She was also very beautiful and talented
 nal uske saundarya kii prashansa sunakar usase prem karne laga
 The message of their love was delivered to Damayanti very efficiently by a swan
 or damyanti bhi apane us anjaan premi kii virah main jalane lagi
 This story has such an effective put of love and suffering that writers and poets, not only from India but also from abroad, could not live without being attracted by it
 bop latin main tathaa dean millman ne angreji kavita main anuwaad karke pashchim ko bhi is katha se bhalee bhaanti parichit karaayaa he
 a king named Bhishmak ruled the country of Vidarbha
 unki putree kaa naam damyanti thi
 Damayanti was as beautiful as Lakshmi
 unheen dinon nishadh desh main virasen ke putr nal rajya karte the
 He was very talented, truthful and a Brahmin devotee
 nishadh desh se jo log vidarbha desh main aate the, ve maharaj nal ke gunon kii prashansa karte the
 This praise also reached Damayanti's ears
 isi tarah vidarbha desh se aane vaale log rajkumaari ke rup or gunon kii charchaa maharaj nal ke samakshkarte
 As a result of this, Nal and Damayanti became attracted towards each other
 mahabharat main dharmraj yudhisthir ke aagrah karne par maharishi brihadshv ne nal-damyanti kii katha sunai- Dharmaraja! In the country of Nishad, there has been a king named Nal, son of Veersen
 ve bade gunavan, param sundar, satyawadee, jitendriya, sabake priy, vedagy evam brahmanbhakt the
 His army was very large
 
 He himself was very proficient in astrology
 ve vir, yoddha, udaar or prabal parakramee bhi the
 He also had some passion for playing gambling
 unheen dinon vidarbha desh main bhim naam ke ek raja rajya karte the
 He was also very virtuous and mighty like Nal
 unhone daman rishi ko prasann karke unke vardaan se chaar santaanen praapt kii thim—teen putr or ek kanya
 The names of the sons were Dum, Dant, and Daman
 putree kaa naam tha—damyanti
 Damayanti was as beautiful as Lakshmi
 uske netra vishaal the
 Even the beautiful girl was not seen in the gods and yakshas
 un dinon kitne hi log vidarbha desh se nishadh desh main aate or raja nal ke saamne damyanti ke rup or gun kaa bakhaan karte
 Even those who went from Nishad country to Vidarbha used to describe the form, quality and sacred character of King Nal in front of Damayanti
 is prakaar donon ke hriday main parsparik anuraag ankurit ho gaya
 One day King Nal saw some swans in the garden of his palace
 unhone ek hans ko pakad liya
 Hans said - 'if you leave me, we will go to Damayanti and describe your qualities in such a way that she will definitely take you
 ’ nal ne hansako chhod diya
 They were flown in unfertile country
 damyanti apane hanson ko dekhakar bahut prasann hui or hanson ko pakadaney ke liye unki ore daudane lagi
 The swan that Damayanti ran to catch, he would say, 'ari Damayanti! Nishad is a king named Nal in the country
 vah ashvinikumar ke samaan sundar he
 No one else is as beautiful as human beings
 vah maano murtiman kaamdev he
 If you become his wife, then both your birth and appearance become successful
 ham logon ne devtaa, gandharva, manushya, sarp or rakshason ko gum-ghumkar dekha he nal ke samaan kahin sundar purush dekhne main nahin aayaa
 Just as you are a gem in women, in the same way Nal is a Bhushan in men
 tum donon kii jodi bahut hi sundar hogi
 Damayanti said - "hansa! Say the same thing to you from the tap
 ’ hans ne nishadh desh main lautakar nal se damyanti kaa sandesh kah diya
 On hearing the fame of King Nal from the mouth of Damayanti Hans, he started loving them
 uski aasakti itani bad gayi ki vah raat-din unka hi dhyaan karti rahati
 The body became foggy and lean
 vah deen-si deekhne lagi
 The Sakhis, following Damayanti's heart rate, requested Vidarbharaj that 'your daughter is unwell
 ’ raja bhim ne apni putree ke sambandh main bada vichaar kiya
 In the end, he reached the decision that my daughter had become married, so she should do it herself
 unhone sab raajaaon ko swayamvar kaa nimantran-patr bhej diya or suchit kar diya ki raajaaon ko damyanti ke swayamvar main padharkar laabh uthaanaa chaiye or meraa manorath purna karnaa chaiye
 The patriarchs of the country, with the sound of elephants, horses and chariots, started reaching the Vidarbha country with vigor while scorching the earth
 bhim ne sabake swaagat satkar kii samuchit vyavastha kii
 The Gods also got news of the Swayamvara of Damayanti through the Devarshi Narada and the mountain
 indra aadi sabhi lokapal bhi apni mandali or vaahanon sahit vidarbha desh ke liye ravaanaa hue
 Raja Nal's mind was already enamored on Damayanti
 unhone bhi damyanti ke swayamvar main sammilit hone ke liye vidarbha desh kii yatra kii
 While descending from heaven, the gods saw that beautiful tapes like Kamadev were going to the Swayamvara of Damayanti
 nal kii surya ke samaan kaanti or lokottar rup-sampatti se devtaa bhi chakit ho gayi
 He recognized that these are the taps
 unhone apane vimaanon ko akaash main khadaa kar diya or neeche utarkar nal se kaha—‘rajendra nal ! aap bade satyavrati hai
 You become a messenger to help us
 ’ nal ne pratigya kar lee or kaha ki ‘karunga’
 Then he asked, 'who are you and what is your job as a messenger?' Indra said - 'we are gods
 main indra hoon or ye agni, varun or yama hai
 We have come here for Damanti
 devataaon ne nal se kaha ki aap hamaare doot banakar damyanti ke paas jaaiye or kahie ki indra, varun, agni or yamadewataa tumhaare paas aakar tumse vivaah karnaa chaahate hai
 Whichever of these gods you accept as husband
 ’ nal ne donon haath jodakar kaha ki ‘devraj’ ! vahaan aap logon ke or mere jane kaa ek hi prayojan he
 That is why it is not appropriate that you send me as an angel
 jisaki kisi stri ko patni ke rup main paane kii ichha ho chuki ho, vah bhala, usko kaise chhod saktaa he or uske paas jaakar aisi baat kah hi kaise saktaa he ? aap log kripaya is vishay main mujhe kshamaa kijiye There was a Swayamvar of Damayanti in which not only the king of the earth, but also the gods came as a tap
 swayamvar main ek saath kai nal khadey the
 Everyone was upset about who the real tap would be
 lekin damyanti jaraa bhi vichlit nahin hui
 He recognized the real tap by eye
 saare devataaon ne bhi unka abhivadan kiya
 In this way, Damayanti recognized her real life and chose her life partner
 nav-dampatti ko devataaon kaa aashirwad praapt hua
 Damayanti nishad-naresh became the queen of King Nal
 donon bade sukh se samay bitaane lage
 Damyanti was a shiromani among husbandmen
 abhimaan to use kabhi chhu bhi na saktaa tha
 In time, a son and a girl were born from Damyanti's womb
 donon bachche mata-pita ke anuroop hi sundar rup or gunse sampann the
 Time does not always remain the same, the cycle of sorrow and happiness keeps going on
 vaise to maharaj nal gunavan, dharmatma tathaa punyashlok the, kintu unamem ek dosha tha —jue kaa vyasan
 One of Nal's brothers was named Pushkar
 vah nal se alag rahata tha
 He invited them for gambling
 khel armbh hua
 Luck was unfavorable
 nal haarane lage, sona, chaandi, rath, rajpaat sab haath se nikal gaya
 Knowing the unfavorable time, Queen Damayanti sent her two children to Kundinpur, the capital of Vidarbha country
 idhar nal jue main apana sarvasv haar gayi
 He removed all the clothes of his body
 keval ek vastra pahanakar nagar se baahar nikle
 Damayanti also followed her husband in just one sari
 ek din raja nal ne sone ke pankh vaale kuch pakshi dekhe
 King Nal thought, if these are captured, some money can be earned by selling them for sustenance
 aisa vichaarkar unhone apane pahanane kaa vastra kholkar pakshiyon par phenkaa
 Birds flew with the clothes
 ab raja nal ke paas tan dhakne ke liye bhi koi vastra na rah gaya
 Nal was more disturbed by Damayanti's misery than he was
 ek din donon jangal main ek vriksh ke neeche ek hi vastra se tan chipaaye pade the
 Damayanti fell asleep due to exhaustion
 raja nal ne sochaa, damyanti ko mere kaaran bada dukh sahan karnaa pad rahaa he
 If i leave it here at this stage, it will somehow reach its father
 yah vichaarkar unhone talwaar se uski aadhi sari ko kaat liya or usee se apana tan dhakkar tathaa damyanti ko usee avasthaa main chhod kar ve chal diye
 When Damyanti fell asleep, poor lady found herself alone and Karun started mourning
 bhukh or pyaas se vyakul hokar vah achaanak ajgar ke paas chali gayi or ajgar use nigalane laga
 Hearing Damyanti's scream, a hunter saved him from being a dragon
 kintu vyaadh swabhaav se dusht tha
 He was fascinated by the beauty of Damayanti and wanted to make him a victim of his job
 damyanti use shaap dete hue boli—‘yadi maine apane pati raja nal ko chhodkar kisi anya purush kaa kabhi chintan na kiya ho to is paapi vyaadh ke jivan kaa abhi ant ho jaay
 Hunter's death was reached as soon as Damayanti was fulfilled
 daivayog se bhatakate hue damyanti ek din chedinaresh subahu ke paas or uske baad apane pita ke paas pahunch gayi
 Finally, one day Maharaj Nal's sorrows also came to an end with the influence of the Satyatta of Damayanti
 donon kaa punarmilan hua or raja nal ko unka rajya bhi waapas mil gaya
 Nal and Damayanti had two twin sons Namah and Dal

 His mother Nitya Venimadhav used to worship God 
 ek din ve mandir main darshan karne gayi to unhen divyoni sunai di - he mata putravati ho
 a garland and a right-handed conch appeared in his lap
 vah prasad paakar bahut khush huin or patidev ko sari baat bataai
 One day Mata saw that light is coming from the sky
 vah prakaash unke mukh main samaa gaya
 Mother became fearless
 thodi der baad unhen jab hosh aayaa to ve uthakar baith gai
 From that day on, a power began to flow in his body
 shushlagn main praat:kaal acharya prakat hue
 Mother did not feel pain at all when she appeared
 punyasadan ji ke ghar balak paidaa hone kii khabar paakar puraa prayag nagar umad padaa

 At the time of playing the child, a parrot would come to him daily and would say 'ram-ram'
 yah ‘ram-ram‘ kaa shabd unke jin kaa aadhaar ban gaya
 The boy and the crow also came to this boy daily

 In the month of Bhadas, cereal ablutions were celebrated on the day of rishi-panchami
 thaal main pakaan, kheer or laddu rakhe gaye lekin balak ramanand ne kel kheer ko ungali lagaai
 Mother fed a little kheer in her mouth
 uske alaava balak ko kuch nahin khaaya
 This Kheer was his diet
 ek din balak ramanand khelte hue puja ke mandir main ja pahunche
 He lifted the right conch shell and started playing
 pita ne shankh ko haath se chin liya or krodhit hone lage
 Child Ramanand ran out

 In the morning, the child was asked to play the conch shell

 At the age of five, when the father taught the verses of some texts, the child immediately remembered
 ek saal main hi balak ramanand ne kai granthon ko kanthsth kar liya
 There was a gathering of scholars in Prayag Kumbh
 isamen balak ramanand ko bhi bulaayaa gaya
 All the scholars put their views in it
 balak ramanand ne kaha- jase camel ke dal par pani kii boond latakati he vaise hi ji is prithvi par hai
 Don't know when it's time to leave? Therefore, you should leave the dispute and do devotion to God

 The child was sacrificed at the age of eight

 But the boy Ramanand was not ready to return

 In a few days, Kumar got the four Ved Upvedas by memorizing them and understood their secrets
 unki prasiddhi sunakar nity-prati anekon log balak ko dekhne aate
 One day Siddha Devi came
 unhone kaha- main kalikhoh se ai hum
 He asked the child in Sanskrit - o Kumar, which woman is very fickle and is hidden in the mind? She brings new substances and puts them in front of people
 parantu ek baar koi use dekh letaa he to vah sadaa ke liye lupt ho jaati he
 On this, the child Ramanand replied - the name of the woman is Maya
 tab vriddha ne kaha- usase byaah kar lo
 Then Kumar said - The mouth turns black as he wishes
 byaah ke samay manushya langadaa ho jaataa he
 That Maya is also blind
 main to brahmacharee hum

 ‘‘vivaah na karne se anekon paap lagate hai
 On this, Ramanand Ji said- It is a matter of ritual

 After saying this, he became silent
 pita ne samajha ki ve hansi main aisa kah rahe hai or vivaah kii taiyaari main lag gaye
 Kanya Madhavi saw in a dream - some deity is saying that if you marry Ramanand, you will be widowed
 yah sunakar uske mata-pita kaa utsaah nasht ho gaya
 Kanya decided to remain unmarried throughout her life and started performing harsh austerities
 ann tyaag kar keval laung khaakar rahane lagi
 He had a second dream - by which you were going to get married, go and teach him, then you will get well soon
 duusare din praat:kaal hi vah apane parivaar ke saath ramanand ji ke saamne prastut hui or mantra diksha lene kii maang karne lagi
 On the refusal of Ramanand ji, other people also started supporting him
 zyada jid karne par ramanand ji ne apane shankh ko baja diya
 As soon as he heard the conch sound, his tomb started
 samadhi main use das janmon kaa samaran ho aayaa
 He said- i have received divine knowledge from God, i am going to Bhagan's abode
 yah kehete hi ek divya vimaan vahaan prakat hua or vah vimaan par baith kar chali gai
 People were surprised at this
 unke mata-pita ne bhi diksha lene kii baat kahi
 Ramanandacharya felt very ashamed at this
 ve vahiin baithe-baithe antardhyaan ho gaye
 The parents fainted and fell
 unhen divya dham ke darshan hue
 Where Kumar Ramanand was seated on the divine throne
 bade-bade detaa or rishi unki stuti kar rahe the
 The blessings God had given him at birth also became known to him

 The parents got up and saw everyone mourning
 chaaro ore pitti dekhakar punya sadan ji ne sharir tyaagane kii ichha kii lekin logon ne unhen dhairya bandhaaya
 At the same time, Maharishi Raghanand appeared with the force of yoga
 shishtha muni ke ataar raghanand ji ke prakat hote hi samast nar nari unke charnon main ja pade
 He understood the problem of the people by applying samadhi
 ve punya sadan ji ko sambodhit kar kehane lage- aapkaa punya mahaan he
 God has given you that they will enjoy Baal Leela in your house for twelve years
 ab ha samay puraa ho gaya he or prabhu apane lok ko chale gayi hai
 On this, people talked to Maharishi Raghanand ji to have darshan once, while Raghanand ji told the need for big Ram Yagya
 us yajna ke baad kumaar ramanand prakat huye
 Maha Raghanandji said to Kumar - You made our yajna successful by giving darshan
 ab aap is bhoomi par dharm main ai giraat ko mitaane ke liye or yanon ke atyaachaar ko khatm karne ke liye yaheen raho
 Maharishi Raghavanand ji duly bestowed Vaishnava renunciation by giving him initiation of Rama Mantra
 ramanand ji panch ganga ghat par tapasya karne lage
 On the request of the people, he would solve the problems of the people by blowing conch shells
 ek murda unki shankh dhwani sunakar jivit ho gaya tha
 When he started getting more disturbed, he stopped playing conch shell
 ve logon ke aagrah par din main sirf ek baar shankh bajaane lage
 One day after midnight, when he went to take a bath in the Ganges, Kali Yuga Raj appeared in front of him

 for the promotion of religion
 aaj unheen ke tapobal se ramanand sampradaay kaa vishaal panth chal rahaa he
 Shri Ramananda was the creator of medieval liberal consciousness, the originator of the Bhakti movement, and the guide of the then religious and social consciousness
 unhone bharat kii saanskrithik jivan dhara ko akshunya pravaahit karne main mahatvapurn yogadan kiya
 He was actually the inspiration of Kabir and Tulsi
 shri ramanand jis yug main hue vah bharat ke itihaas main dharm, samskruti tathaa samaaj ke hraas kaa kaal tha
 Indian society was not able to recover from the storm of Islam
 taimur ke akraman se lekar babar ke akraman tak samooche samaaj main raajnneetik or saanskrithik paraabhav kaa kaal tha
 An important gift of Shri Ramanand was to make Rama Bhakti a national awakening by making it the basis of a wider cultural movement
 yadhyapi alwaar sahitya main rambhakti kaa varnan dakshin bharat main 9veen shatabdi ke prarambh main ho gaya tha
 But in North India, it was mainly propagated in the eleventh century
 ramanuj ne gyarahavin shatabdi main krishna bhakthi kii upasna kaa prachlan kiya, vahaan shri ramanand ko aage chalakar uttari bharat main rambhakti kaa shrey praapt he
 Soon, the Ganges of Ram bhakti started flowing from one corner of the country to the other
 ram ke naam ne anek saamaajik or saanskrithik vyaadhiyon ke liye rambaan aushadhi kaa kaam kiya
 Rambhakti proved helpful in binding the unity of the entire country in the north and south
 isane samaaj main aashaa, aatm vishwaas tathaa swabhimaan kaa bhav jaagrath kiya
 Shri Ramanand initiated a social revolution through Ramabhakti
 saamaajik vishmataaon or bahari aadambaron main jakade samaaj main punarutthan kii ore pehla kadam badhaane vaale ramanand the
 Through Rambhakti, he made a successful attempt to create a sense of social harmony and co-ordination among various sections of the society
 shri ramanand ne apane prasiddh granth shri vaishnavamtaj bhaskar main prachlit oonch-neech kii bhaavana par krur prahaar kiya
 On the one hand, Kabir and many disciples became the messengers of Ramanand ji's speech, on the one hand, with the influence of Shri Ramanand's words and unitary sense of action, on the other hand, Tulsi, the great worshiper of Ram Bhakti, became his pracharak
 ek ore kabir ne ‘jaat-paant‘ puche na koi, hari ko bhaje so hari kaa hoi‘ kaa divya sandesh diya, to tulsi ne duusari ore ‘siya ram may sab jag jaani‘ kaa amrit vachan bolaa
 In fact, Ramanand could do what many scholars of India and many saints could not do
 rambhakti kaa yah divya shankhanaad samooche samaaj ko jodne kaa mantra ban gaya
 Also, Sri Ramananda created an effective and wonderful disciple tradition
 vishwa ke samooche itihaas main kisi bhi vyakti ne utane shreshth tathaa samarpit shishyon kaa nirmaan nahin kiya jitna ramanand ne
 Twelve famous disciples of Ramananda became the main propagators of the Bhakti movement
 unki rambhakti kii dhara do pravahon main vibhajit hui thi
 One is in formless Nirguna Rāmbhakti and the other in Sāguna Avatari Rāmbhakti
 ek kaa pratinidhitiv kiya kabir ne tathaa duusare ko vyapak swaroop pradaan kiya tulsi ne
 The revolutionary Kabir learned the secret of Nirgun Rama and devotion from Ramanand
 yadhyapi ram kii avatharavaad kii dharna ko unhone sweekaar nahin kiya, parantu ishwar ko vrahm ke rup main sweekaar kiya
 This is evidenced by one of his positions in Sri Guru Granth Sahib, which is given in it
 kabir par ramanand kaa prabhaav praaia: sabhi vidwaanon ne sweekaar kiya he ki unhone bhakthi ke liye abhaya kaa paath ramanand se hi siikhaa
 Ram's name appears 217 times in the Kabir Granthwali, Kabir's devotion is above caste differences or class differences like Ramananda
 isamen tanik bhi andeh nahin he yadi ramanand va kabir hindu samaaj ke upekshit janon main ek aashaa or bharose kii neenv na daalate to unamem se adhiktar musalmaan ho gaye hote
 Mahakavi Tulsi coordinated the devotion of Ramananda and Advaita Vedanta and taught Sagun Rambhakti to the world
 vastut: samaaj ke prabud vichaar tathaa jan saamaanya ke vichaaron kaa adbhut samanvay tulsi ke darshan main drushtigochar hota he
 While Shankar's monotheism is a reflection of enlightened thought, Ramanand's devotional views represent the feeling of the common man
 donon kaa adbhut samanvay tulsi main dikhalaai detaa he
 For this reason his famous book Ramcharitmanas is considered among the greatest texts of the world
 dharm kii maryaada ko mahatv dete hue unhone bhakthi kii dhara prabhavit kii
 Thus it can be concluded that it is to Mr
 Ramanandacharya's credit that he gave love and Ram bhakti the form of a mass cultural movement in North India
 rambhakti ke madhyam se unhone desh main nav jaagran kiya
 He instilled confidence and social consciousness in Indian society
 iske falswaroop dharm mat parivartan kii prakriya avaruddh hui
 This movement spread through him through Jan Bhasha soon expressed itself as a Bhakti movement and which Kabir and Tulsi gave a defensive as well as aggressive form
 vahi rambhakti kii aviral dhara aaj bhi bhartiya samaaj ko samete hue prerana va rashtriya jaagran kaa strot bani hui he

 Once inside the body, a complex process of it starts and it works through a number of processes, which are described below
 coffee yaa anya peya kii caffeine ko pet or choti aant 45 minute ke bheetar avashoshit kar leti he or sharir kii sabhi utakon main vitarit kar detii he
 It is eliminated by first-order kinetics
 caffeine ko guda ke madhyam se bhi grahan kiya ja saktaa he, argotamine tartrate or caffeine ke sapojitary ke nirmaan se pramanit or chlorobutanol or caffeine 
 Biological half-life of caffeine - it takes time for the body to eliminate half of the total amount of caffeine - it varies widely according to the age of the individuals, liver function, pregnancy, some similar drugs and in addition to caffeine Metabolism also requires enzyme levels in the liver

 Once reached in the brain, its major action begins as a nonselective antagonist of the adenosine receptor
 caffeine anu, banaavat main adenosine ke samaan hi hote hai or unhen sakriy kiye bina koshikaon kii sataha par adenosine receptaron ko baandh dete hai 
 isliye, caffeine ek pratispardhi pravrodhak kii tarah kaam karata he
 Adenosine is found in every part of the body, as it plays a role in fundamental atp-related energy metabolism and is essential for RNA synthesis, but has a specific function in the brain
 iske kai pramaan hai ki anoksia or ischemia sahit vibhinn prakaar ke chayapachay tanaav ke dwaara mastishk adenosine ke jamaav main vruddhi hoti he
 Evidence also indicates that brain adenosine acts to protect the brain by suppressing nerve activity and increasing blood flow through A2A and A2B receptors located in the soft muscles of the vascular system
 adenosine kaa pratikaar karke, caffeine sthir pramastishkeey rakt pravaah ko 22% se 30% tak kam karata he
 Caffeine also generally has a non-suppressive effect on neural activity
 lekin yah nahin siddh nahin hua he ki in prabhaavon kii vajah se kis tarah jaagran or satarkta main vruddhi hoti he

 Several classes of adenosine receptors with distinct structural distributions have been described
 A1 receptor vyapak rup se vitarit hai or calcium grahan kii karrwai ko rokane kaa kaam karte hai
 The A2A receptor has a heavy concentration in the basal ganglia, an area that plays an important role in behavioral control, but can also be found in other parts of the brain, and at a lower density
 There is evidence that the A2A receptor interacts with the dopamine system, which is involved in reward and wakefulness
 A2A receptaron ko dhamneey deevaaron or rakt koshika jhilliyon main bhi paaya ja saktaa he
 ) iske saamaanya neuroprotective prabhaav ke alaava, yah vishwaas karne ke kaaran hai ki adenesin ko adhik vishisht rup se sone-jagane ke chakra ko niyantrit karne main shaamil kiya ja saktaa he
 Robert mccarley and his colleagues state that the primary cause of adenosine congestion may be the sensation of drowsiness after prolonged mental activity, and that sleep-prompting via the activation of awakening-stimulated nerves via A1 receptors and indirect effects on A2A receptors These effects may be mediated by activation of nerves
 Recent studies have provided additional evidence for the importance of A2A, not A1 receptors
 caffeine ke kuch gaun prabhaav shaayad adenosine se asambandhit kaaryon ke kaaran hote hai
 Like other methylated xanthines, caffeine phosfodysterres pravrodhak sieempi -phosfodysterres ) anzimon kaa pravrodh karte hai, jo koshikaon main chakree eempi ko gaiyr-chakree rup main badal detaa he, is tarah koshikaon main sieempi ko vruddhi kaa avasar detaa he

 Ancient philosophy 2
 madhyakaalin darshan 3
 Modern philosophy pracheen darshan main manushya kii buddhi ko prayek vishay par sochane kaa adhikaar tha
 In the medieval period, this right was challenged by Christianity
 madhyakaalin darshan kaa mukhya kaam vishwaas or buddhi ke daavon kii jaanch karnaa tha
 Faith claimed that an important part of truth is divine invention, whether it is understood by intelligence or not, it has to be believed
 aarambh main isai vichaarkon ne vishwaas or buddhi kii dharanaon ko abhinn sweekaar kiya
 After this, philosophy was given a secondary position rather than religion and made intellect a slave of faith; In the end, the intellect emphasized its authority and the areas of faith and intellect were separated
 wiliam durands ne kaha ki satya do prakaar kaa hota he- ek hi siddhant ek drushti se satya or duusari drushti se asaty ho saktaa he
 Medieval philosophy is predominantly the philosophy of scholarship
 aathvin shatee main iskaa aarambh hua; 11veen or 12veen shatiyon main iskaa vikaas hua; 13veen shatee iskaa yauvan kaal tha, 14veen or 15veen shatiyon main aantarik virodhon tathaa kuch bahari kaarnon ne ise samaapt kar diya
 Among the ideas that led to intense differences were the struggle of realism and nomenclature of philosophical outlook
 vaiyaktik sthiti main ham anek manushyon ko dekhte hai, iske atirikt manushya kaa pratyay bhi hamaara ek vichaar he
 What is the position of this suffix in power? According to realism, this suffix exists separately from particular humans; Special human beings are only incomplete copies of it or examples of it
 namawaad ke anusaar vaastavik satta vishesh manushyon kii he, "manushya" keval ek naam he, jo kuch samaantaaon ke aadhaar par ham kuch vyaktiyon main se har ek ko de dete hai
 In fact it was a quarrel of realism and realism
 isi se miltaa hua vivekwaad or anubhavvaad kaa matbhed tha
 For those who did not believe in the common, all knowledge was sensory knowledge
 is darshanik matbhed ne dharm main kai siddhanton kaa bhed khadaa kar diya
 The main topics of dispute were- insalm vidwat siddhant kaa sthaapak samajha jaataa he
 That device has a special place in the history of philosophy, which Anselm gave in favor of the existence of God
 kaant ne is yukti ko mana nahin, parantu kaha ki jo anya yuktiyaan di jaati hai, ve insalm kii yukti kii roopaantar hi hai
 The names of Thomas Aquinus and Duns Scotts are of special importance in medieval philosophy
 yatharthwaad or namawaad ke teevr vivaad main ve donon pakshon ke pramukh pravaktaa the
 Thomas Aquinus believed that certain fields of knowledge are subjects of faith; Even then, with the help of those basic rules, which are present in the active intellect of each one, knowledge can tell something about the nature of the world and God
 dans scotus kaa vichaar tha ki sara gyaan visheshon tak simit he; saamaanya pratyayon kaa astitv naam maatr he
 Okham, a worthy disciple of Duns Scotts, tried to succeed in the spread of nomenclature
 vidvadwad tark main itnaa ulajh gaya ki dharm se iskaa sambandh tut sa gaya
 "amendment" drew people of religious instinct
 dharm or darshan ke parthaky ne aadhunik darshan ke liye maarg khol diya
 In the modern period, human intelligence again started the work of independent deliberation with curiosity
 kuch logon ke vichaar main bekan ne iskaa marsanket kiya, parantu bahumat decort ko iskaa sthaapak maanata he
 The successful and failed controversy of philosophers inspired Decart to enter the certainty of mathematics in philosophy if possible
 uske baad spinoja or libniz kii bhi yahi bhaavana rahi
 In England, he turned to thinker psychology and made human intelligence a subject of research
 anubhavvaad ko lock, warkale or hum jaise pratham shrenee ke vichaarak mil gaye
 The rationalism of Continental thinkers and the empiricism of England reached two opposite directions as far as they could go
 ab germany darshanik vivechan kaa centre bana
 Kant sought to integrate rationalism and empiricism into criticalism
 hegal or shapenhavar ne pratyaywad ko aage badhaayaa
 The three main branches of this modern philosophy are: iske atirikt vishesh vishyon par bhi paryaapt vichaar hua
 decart started with occasional doubts
 turant hi use pataa laga ki yah andeh swayan andeh kaa vishay nahin ho saktaa
 His first suspicious realization was- adhik vichaar se vah is nishkarsh par pahunchaa ki paramatma or bhautik jagat kaa astitv bhi vimal or spasht chintan kaa fal he or isliye asandigdh tathy hai
 All power is of two types - man and nature
 ye donon dravya hai - sarvatha ek duusare se bhinn
 The quality of man is consciousness, the quality of nature is expansion or spread
 in donon kaa bhed bhed kii paraakaashtha he
 Baruth Spinoza stated that infinity is inherent in the suffix of matter
 anant ek hi ho saktaa he, samgr hi akelaa dravya he
 Anant has infinite qualities, but man can only know about two qualities, contemplation and expansion
 chintan ke vividh aakaar aatma yaa jeev kehalaate hai; vistaar ke aakaar bhautik padaarth hai
 The two have no parallel of causality, only parallelism
 ekmaatr kaaran to samgr yaa ishwar hi he; manushya anivaaryta ke adheen hai
 Acceptance of inevitability is freedom
 udaaegon ko samajhnaa, unhen anand or prem ke shashan main karnaa yahi manushya kaa lakshya he, isi ko ishwarprem kehete hai
 Leibniz said that matter is not one, but one type
 usne moulik dravya ko chid bindu kaa spasht sampark kisi duusare chid bindu se nahin hota
 In the beginning, God created such harmony in them that the self-realization of each tells him what is happening in the souls of others
 ek nipun ghadi banane vaale kii banaai hui ghadiyaan ek duusare ko prabhavit nahin karatin, parantu sabhi ek hi samay dikhaati hai
 Decart adopted dualism, Spinoza adopted monotheism, and Leibniz adopted spiritual pluralism
 jaan lock ne apni vikhyath pustak "maanav buddhi par niabandh" ko sahaj, aprapt pratyayon kii asweekruti se aarambh kiya
 He said that in the beginning the mind of a human is like a blank plate, experience puts many kinds of thoughts on it
 in vichaaron main kuch samved ke rup main hote hai, kuch man ke chintan kaa fal hote hai
 There is another type of direct idea of matter
 man kuch gunon ko sanyukt paata he or unke sanyog ke aadhaar kii kalpana karata he, aise adhar ko dravya samajha jaataa he
 Some properties are present in material matter, some are understood in illusion
 akruti, pariman, thospan, gati pehle prakaar ke gun hai; rup, rang, ras, gandh, shabd hamaare baahar nahin, apitu hamaare andar hai ye kramash: pradhan or apradhan gun kehalaate hai
 The suffix of external material we make is not clear
 yah nahin jaanate ki vibhinn gun kaise sanyukt hote hai, na yah jaanate hai ki gunon ke samooh ke vishesh gun kaise baahar bah aate hai
 George Berkeley said that the forte is also a mental transformation, like the secondary child
 donon prakaar ke gunon ko chhod den to shesh asthul vichaar hi rah jaataa he or aise vichaaron kaa koi astitv nahin
 In this way, Berkeley supported materialism
 sari satta chetanon or unke vichaaron kii he
 Our perception, in large measure, is imposed on us; i don't decide what i will see when i open my eyes
 is bodh kaa kaaran paramatma kii kriya he
 This action occurs according to certain rules; These rules are named as Prakrit rules
 sari satta chetanon or unki chetnavasthaon se hi bani he
 There was still a leg up in empiricism, he picked up by David Hume
 hum ne kaha ki anubhav jo bodh hamen detaa he, ve sab ek duusare se pruthak hote hai, parantu unamem kisi prakaar kaa sambandh nahin hota
 We consider a group of properties that we have been seeing together
 yahi gyaata kii sthiti he, vah bhi chetan avasthaaon kaa samooh hi he
 Hume described the suffix of matter as a creation of emotion and imagination and supported the perception
 vigyaan kii neenv kaaran-kaary sambandh par he, hum ne anya sambandhon kii tarah, is sambandh ko kalpit bataaya or anubhavvaad ko ndehbaad main parinat kar diya
 Empiricism started with the assumption that all our knowledge is received from outside, Hume said that empiricalism has no possibility of definite knowledge
 emanuele kaant ne vivekwaad or anubhavvaad kii pruthak dhaaraon ko milakar unhen ek nadital par bahaane kaa ytn kiya
 He said that the raw material of knowledge is obtained from outside, the mind gives it the essential shape
 kaant kaa pratyaywad abhautikwaad na tha, uski dharna thi ki gyaan ke nirmaan main man kaa yogadan anivaary ansh he
 Sensations are received from outside, but they have to pass through the molds of the country and time and then they become combined knowledge
 desh or kaal maansik akritiyaan hai
 In making decisions based on the similarity and inequality of suffixes, the mind binds them to formulas of quality, magnitude, relationship and size
 kaant kaa pratham uddeshy vigyaan ko hyam ke akraman se bachaana tha
 For some time he accepted Hume's theory of causality
 peeche isi kii aalochana ko apana lakshya banaaya
 The existence of a cause-work relationship is unquestionable: the question is what is its basis
 kaant is vichaar main hum se sahamat he ki bahya ghatnaon main iskaa strot nahin
 He says that the intellect applies it to those events on its own behalf and transforms it into a system of absolute multiplicity
 gyaan grahan karnaa hi nahin, yah nirmaan he - man kii kriti iskaa moulik chinh he
 The "pure intellect" cannot go beyond the world of appearances; When she tries to leave, she gets involved in protests
 paroksh kaa gyaan, jaisaa bhi yah ho, vyaavhaarik buddhi kii dein he
 Man is essentially a moral being
 kartavyapaalan ke liye aavashyak he ki katrta main swadhin karm kii kshamta ho
 Our goal is complete achievement
 is anant lakshya kii siddhi ke liye anant kaal kii aavashyaktaa he
 The fruits of auspicious and inauspicious must be found, it is a demand of moral feeling
 iske liye paryaapt shakti kaa shaasha hona chahie
 Practical intelligence recognizes independence, immortality, and theism
 kaant ne kaha tha ki buddhi kii khoj abhas kii duniya main simit he, ise nirpeksh ke sabandh main vyarthan chintan nahin karnaa chahie
 Those who followed him did not accept his advice and made the absolutes the subject of his own discussion
 hegel ne kaha ki moulik satta "man" he
 The sequence of development in the external world is in contemplation - logic and philosophy are only one type of study
 ja kuch vivekaatmak he vah satya he, jo satya he, vah vivekaatmak he
 The fundamental fact of development is "opposition"
 jagat main prayek sthiti main uskaa virodh nihit hota he
 After this protest appears, coordination occurs in both situations
 chunki man is parivartan kaa aadhaar hota he, saamaanya rup main gati pragati hoti he
 In perception, every conception gives rise to conception and then the two are coordinated
 is samanvay main unche str se dikhaai detaa he ki dharna or pratidharana donon main satya tha, yadhyapi aanshik satya tha
 Many examples of this sequence are found in philosophical discussions
 vivekwaad ek dharna thi, isane anubhavvaad ke rup main pratidharana ko janm diya
 Kant coordinated both in his criticalism and stated that there is partial truth on both sides
 prayek samanvay nai dharna banataa he or nai pratidharana ko janm detaa he
 This sequence continues continuously
 raajnneeti ke sambadh main hegel is vyapak niyam ko bhul gaya or usne kaha ki prasha main raashtra ne apane antim aakaar ko praapt kar liya he
 But the speaker here was not the philosopher Hegel, but the indignant Hegel
 shapenhavar ne bhi moulik tatv kii khoj ko apana lakshya banaaya
 Like Hegel, he considered the mind to be such an element, but in the place of prudence or wisdom, he gave this resolution to the resolution - not to me or my own resolve, but to the larger resolution
 jad jagat main ye sankalp praakrit shakti ke vividh roopon main vyakt hota he, jaise aakarshan, garmi, prakaash, bijli aadi
 In the life of flora and fauna, it is expressed as an administrative power and takes the form of self-consciousness in humans
 manushya swabhaav se sukh kaa utpaadan karnaa chahta he, parantu jis sthiti main vah padaa he, usamen uskaa ytn vifal hota he
 The struggle of life itself creates infinite grief
 manushya ke liye uchit nahin he ki har prakaar kii ichha yaa aakanksha ko chhodkar tapasvi jivan vyateet kare or vastuon kii vyapak asarataa par manan kare
 Hegel considered prudence to be the core; He had to be optimistic
 andhe sankalp kaa multatv maananevaala shapenhavar aadhunik kaal kaa sabase bada abhadravaadi tha
 The discussion that took place after the middle of the 19th century, was usually in relation to specific subjects

 Pearce and William James- Behaviorism nitshe- shapenhavar ne kaha tha ki sansar main andhe sankalp kaa shashan vyapak he
 Nietzsche stated that the highest aspiration for man is the 'aspiration for power'

 The policy of free men is very different from the policy of slaves

 Moral values must be re-evaluated
 balavaan vyaktiyon or jatiyon kaa kaam aage badhanaa he; jo rukaawat maarg main aae, use thokar lagaakar pare kar dena he
 It is in the benefit of the weak also to help the strong to become more powerful
 bakrii ke liye isse adhik bhagya kii vastu kya he ki vah sher ke sharir kaa ansh ban jaae? Herbert Spencer and Bergson - Herbert Spencer spread natural evolutionism
 prakruti or gati kaa pun: vitaran nirantar hota rahata he, ek manzil par jivan vyakt ho jaataa he or iske baad uchit samay par chetana prakat ho jaati he
 Bergsan said that motion is only a change, it does not have the ability to produce life
 prakruti kii gati main aavriti hoti he, nutanata nahin hoti or nutanata jivan kaa pramukh chinh he
 Nature is the ashes of life, the basic element of life-power
 bergasaan jivan or chetana ko sanyukt karata he, kahin-kahin to inhen abhinn maanata prathit hota he
 Bergsan named his major book "productive Development"
 is naam se hi pataa lagata he ki prakritik vikaswad se uskaa drushtikon kaise bhinn he
 Life is a continuous flow
 buddhi kaa kaam vyavhaar kii suvidha ke liye vastuon kaa todna phodna he; yah jivan ko uske vaastavik rup main dekh nahin sakati
 Antrajyoti sees life flow
 kaant ne kaha tha ki buddhi abhas kii duniya se pare nahin ja sakati
 Bergsan also limited his territory in relation to this world
 wiliam james - america ke vichaarkon ne 'satya ke swaroop' ko vivechan kaa pramukh vishay banaaya
 Charles Pearce founded "behaviorism"; James erected the building on this foundation
 "satya" ke do samaadhaan prasiddh the- anurupatavaad or avirodhwaad
 According to James, the beliefs that prove to be helpful in life are true, those who obstruct are untrue
 aacharan kii tarah gyaan main bhi satya or upyogita ek hi hai
 According to conformism, there is a similarity between the idea of the knower and the actual situation in true knowledge
 avirodhwaad ke anusaar hamaara gyaan hamaare vichaaron se pare ja nahin saktaa; jo vichaar shesh gyaan hamaare vichaaron se pare ja nahin saktaa; jo vichaar shesh gyaan se sanyukt ho saktaa he, vah satya he
 According to behaviorism, the idea that can result in a successful action is true

 The winds of continuous flow throughout the year in both the Earth's shells from the subtropical high-pressure tropics to the equatorial low-pressure tropics, about 30 degrees north and south latitudes in the geographical location of the Earth, are called commercial winds

 Here the word 'trade' is derived from the German language, which means the specified path or route
