 Earlier in Sanskrit literature there is a tradition of Nighantu, a compilation of difficult Vedic words and his commentary composed by Yask and other scholars in the seventh century BC
 is parampara ke tahat vibhinn vishyon ke nighantu taiyaar kiye gayi jinamein dhanvantari rachit ayurveda kaa nighantu bhi shaamil tha
 After this the emergence and development of Namamala dictionary in Sanskrit and Hindi is visible

 The Amarkosh composed by Amarsingh occupies the top place in the countless Namamala dictionaries composed during the period from 5th-6th to 18th century
 kosh rachana ke is parmparik bhartiya udhyam ke centre main shabd or shabd-rachana thi
 These lexicons that highlight the words, their various forms, their synonyms, their origins and development process, were helpful in the creation of knowledge, but they could not be placed in the category of knowledge

 He also wrote that the Knowledge Dictionary of Hindi is not a translation of Bangla, but was originally written in Hindi
 in koshon ke alaava hardev bahari rachit prasad sahitya kosh, premanarayan tandon krit 'hindi sevisansar' or gyanmandal dwaara prakashit sahityakosh ullekhneey he

 yah gatij urja kii vah maatra he, jo ek electron dwaara nirvaat main ek volt kaa vibhavantar paar karne par praapt kii jaati he
 In simple terms, it is equal to the product of 1 volt and 1 electronic charge, where one volt = one joule per coulomb
 
 An electron volt is a very small amount of energy: albert ainstin ke anusaar, urja bhaar ke tulya he, jaisaakh ki prasiddh bhaar-urja-tulyata sutara main vyakt bhi he:e = mc2 
 atah yah bhautik kanon hetu saamaanya he, jahaan poor urja praayah paraspar badalte rahete hai, ev / c2 yaa saraltar ev ko bhaar kii ikai hetu prayog karte hue
 For example, 1
022 mev of energy can be obtained by eradicating the load of both an electron and a cube, 0
511 mev / c2, the mass of the electron is 0
938 gev / c2, making gev / c2 a very convenient unit of particle physics
 tulana hetu: Transfer factor: ek prakashanu ke urja E, aavriti f or tarangadairghy λ kaa sambandh he: Where h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light
 For example, the spectrum of direct light consists of waves ranging from 400 nm to 700 nm
 pratyaksh prakaash ke prakashanuon main urjaaen hoti hai: to ek electron volt ek adhorakt photone kii bhi urja hoti he, jisaki tarangadairghy lagbhag 1240 nm he
 Similarly, 10ev energy is ultraviolet wavelength 124 nm and more
 kanik bhautikee main, dooriyaan or samayon ko kai baar pratilom electron volt main bhi vyakt kiya jaataa he, kuch antaran karkon ke saath: Talla Sarna is a village in Bageshwar district of Kumaon division under the Uttarakhand state of India in Kafligar tehsil

 The Narmada Bachao Andolan is an example of the maturity of the environmental movements going on in India
 isane pehali baar paryaavaran tathaa vikaas ke sangharsh ko rashtriya str par charchaa kaa vishay banaaya jisamen na keval visthapit logon balki vaigyanikon, gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon tathaa aam janata kii bhi bhagidaari rahi
 The Sardar Sarovar Dam Project on the Narmada River was inaugurated in 1961 by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru
 lekin teen rajyon-gujarat, madhya pradesh tathaa rajasthan ke madhya ek upyukt jal vitaran niti par koi sahmati nahin ban paayi
 In 1969, the government set up the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal to start the project work after resolving the water dispute
 1979 main nyaaydhikaran sarvasammati par pahunchaa tathaa narmada ghati pariyojna ne janm liya jisamen narmada nadi tathaa uski 4134 nadiyon par do vishaal baandhon - gujarat main sardaar sarovar baandh tathaa madhya pradesh main narmada sagar baandh, 28 madhyam baandh tathaa 3000 jal pariyojnaon kaa nirmaan shaamil tha
 In 1985, the World Bank announced a loan of $ 450 million for this project, according to the government, this project will provide water for irrigation to 27 million hectares of drought prone areas of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan, electricity will be created
 , Water will be available for drinking and flooding will be prevented in the area
 narmada pariyojna ne ek gambhir vivaad ko janm diya he
 On one hand, this project is being considered as an indicator of prosperity and development, as a result of which benefits of irrigation, drinking water supply, flood control, new employment opportunities, electricity and drought prevention etc
 are being talked about
 It is estimated that this will submerge 37000 hectares of land in three states, of which 13000 hectares is forest land
 yah bhi anumaan he ki isse 248 gaanv ke ek lakh se adhik log visthapit honge
 Out of which 58 percent people are from tribal area
 is pariyojna ke virodh ne ab ek jan andolan kaa rup le liya he
 During 1980- 87, Anil Patel, the leader of Ank Vahni, a non-governmental organization that advocates for the rights of the people, fought in the High Court and the Supreme Court over the rights of resettlement of the people
 sarvocch nyaayalay ke adeshon ke parinamswaroop gujarat sarkaar ne disambar 1987 main ek punarvaas niti ghoshit kii
 On the other hand, the Narmada Bachao Andolan brought by Megha Patkar in 1989 has highlighted the shortcomings of the implementation of the Sardar Sarovar Project and the policies to rehabilitate the displaced people
 shuru main andolan kaa udadeshy baandh ko rokkar paryaavaran vinaash tathaa isse logon ke visthaapan ko rokna tha
 Later, the aim of the movement became to go to the court to look after the relief work given by the government to the displaced people due to the dam and their rights
 andolan kii yah bhi maang he ki jin logon kii jameen lee ja rahi he unhenyojana main bhagidaari kaa adhikaar hona chahie, unhen apane liye na keval uchit bhugtan kaa adhikaar hona chahie balki pariyojna ke laabhon main bhi bhagidaari honi chahie
 In this process, the Narmada Bachao Andolan has put a question mark on the model of current development
 narmada bachaao andolan jo ek jan andolan ke rup main ubhara, kai samajaseviyon, paryaavarnavidon, chaatro, mahilaon, adivaasiyon, kisaanon tathaa maanav adhikaar kaaryakartaaon kaa ek sangathit samooh bana
 The movement adopted several methods of protest such as hunger strike, padyatras, through newspapers, and tried to spread the word to the common people and the government by including film artists and celebrities in their movement
 iske mukhya kaaryakartaaon main medha patkar ke alaava anil patel, bukar sammaan se navaji gayi arundhati roy, baba amte aadi shaamil hai
 The Narmada Bachao Andolan took a new turn in 1989
 sitambar, 1989 main madhya pradesh ke harasood jagah par ek aam sabha hui jisamen 200 se adhik gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon ke 45000 logon ne bhaag liya
 For the first time in India, the question of 'narmada' has now become a national issue
 yah paryaavaran ke mudde par ab tak kii sabase badi raily thi jisamen desh ke sabhi bade gaiyr-sarkari sanghathanon tathaa aam aadmi ke adhikaron kii raksha main lage samajaseviyon ne hissaa liya
 The Harsud Conference not only opposed the dam but also named it 'destructive development'
 puure vishwa ne is paryaavarniya ghatana ko bade dhyaan se dekha
 In December 1990, a 'sangharsh Yatra' was also organized by the Narmada Bachao Andolan
 padayatriyon ko aashaa thi ki ve sarkaar ko sardaar sarovar baandh pariyojna par vyapak purnvichaar ke liye dabaav daal sakenge
 Around 6000 people traveled from Rajghat to Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat
 iskaa sakaaratmak parinaam bhi dekhne ko mila
 Keeping in mind the public sentiments, the World Bank set up an impartial commission in 1991 to review the dam
 is ayog ne kaha ki pariyojna kaa kaary vishwa bank tathaa bharat sarkaar kii nitiyon ke anuroop nahin ho rahaa he
 The World Bank thus pulled out of the project in 1994
 4 However the state government decided to continue the project
 is par medha patkar ke 1993 main bhukh hadtaal rakhi jiskaa mukhya uddeshy baandh nirmaan sthal se logon ke visthaapan ko rokna tha
 When the agitators saw that the guidelines given by the Namda Control Corporation and the state government in 1987 by the Ministry of Environment and Forests were not being implemented, in 1994, the Narmada Bachao Andolan filed a petition in the Supreme Court and asked the judiciary to settle the case Requested to stop the construction of the dam
 1995 ke armbh main supreme court ne aadesh diya ki sarkaar baandh ke baaki kaaryon ko tab tak roak de jabatak visthapit ho chuke logon ke purnvas kaa prabandh nahin ho jaataa
 On October 18, 2000, the Supreme Court approved the resumption of the dam and increasing its height to 90 meters
 isamen kaha gaya ki unchaai pehle 90 or phir 138 meter tak ja sakati he, lekin iske liye kadam kadam par yah sunishchit karnaa hoga ki paryaavaran ko khatra to nahin he or logon ko basaane kaa kaary thik tareeke se chal rahaa he, saath hi nyaaypalika ne visthapit logon ke purnvas ke liye naye disha-nirdesh die jinke anusaar naye sthaan par purnvasit logon ke liye 500 vyaktiyon par ek primari skool, ek panchayat ghar, ek chikitsaalay, pani tathaa bijli kii vyavastha tathaa ek dharmik sthal avashya hona chahie
 In April 2006, the Narmada Bachao Andolan was again stirred as it was decided to increase the height of the dam from 110 meters to 122 meters
 megha patkar jo pehle se hi visthapit hue logon ke punarvaas kii maang ko lakar sangharsh kar raheen thim, anshan par baith gayin
 On 17 April 2006, on the petition of Narmada Bachao Andolan, the Supreme Court warned the concerned state governments that further construction of the dam would be stopped if proper rehabilitation of the displaced people is not done
 sensor ek aisa upkaran he jo kisi bhautik raashi ko maapne kaa kaary karata he tathaa ise ek aise sanket main parivartit kar detaa he jise kisi paryvekshak yaa yantra dwaara padhaa ja saktaa he
 For example, a mercury-filled glass thermometer converts the measured temperature to the expansion and contraction of a fluid that can be read on a calibrated glass tube
 ek thermokapal taapmaana ko ek output voltage main parivartit kar detaa he jise ek voltmetre dwaara padhaa ja saktaa he
 In terms of accuracy, all sensors need to be calibrated to known standards
 sensoron kaa upyog rosemara kii vastuon main kiya jaataa he
 Such as - touch-sensitive lift buttons and lamps whose touch to the ground floor makes it dim or fast
 in sensoron ke or bhi anginat anuprayog hai jiske bare main adhikansh log abhi tak parichit nahin hai
 These applications include carts, machines, space technology, medicine, manufacturing and robotics
 ek sensor kii samvedansheeltaa yah suchit karti he ki maapit raashi ke badalane par sensor kaa output kitni baar badalata he
 For example, if the mercury of a thermometer is 1 cm liquefied as a result of a change of 1 ° c in temperature, its sensitivity is 1 cm / ° C
 jo sensor bahut chote parivartanon ko maapte hai, unamem bahut ucch koti kii samvedansheeltaa honi chahie
 The sensors also impact the way they measure; For example, a thermometer used to measure room temperature is cooled by pouring it into a cup filled with a hot fluid while the thermometer is heated by that fluid
 sensoron kii banaavat aisi honi chahie ki un par kam prabhaav pade jis par maapne kaa kaary kiya jaataa he
 This often improves with the shortening of the sensor and other benefits can also come from it
 praudyogic pragati MEMS praudyogiki prayukt microcenseron ke rup main sookshmdarsheey str par adhik se adhik sensoron ke utpaadan ko niyat karata he
 In most cases, a microsensor reaches significantly higher speeds and sensitivity than elliptical approaches
 ek acha sensor nimnlikhit niyamon kaa anusaran karata he: The design of ideal sensors is linear
 aise kisi sensor kaa output sanket maapit gundharm visheshta ke maan ke raikhik rup se samaanupatik hota he
 The sensitivity is then defined as the ratio of the output signal and the measured property characteristic
 udhaahranswaroop, yadi ek sensor taapmaana maapne kaa kaary karata he or iskaa ek voltage output he to samvedansheeltaa ek sthiraank hoti he jisaki ikai he; yah sensor raikhik hota he kyonki sabhi maapan binduon par anupaat sthir hota he
 If the sensor is not ideal then several types of interference can be seen: in sabhi vyutkramon ko paddatibaddh trutiyon yaa kramarahit trutiyon ke rup main vargeekrut kiya ja saktaa he
 Methodological errors can sometimes be compensated through some type of calibration policy
 shor ek kramarahit truti he, jaise nispandan, jise sanket prakriya dwaara saadharantaya sensor ke gatyaatmak gatividhi kii keemat par kam kiya ja saktaa he
 The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change that it detects in the amount being measured
 praayah kisi ankiy pradarshan main sabase kam mahatvapurn ank main utaar-chadhaav hoga jo yah suchit karata he ki keval us pariman ke parivartan main hi vibhedan hua he
 Differentiation is related to the accuracy with which measurement is performed
 udhaahranswaroop, ek scanning tanneling jaanch parmaanuon or anuon main vibhedan kar saktaa he
 Biological sensors are found in all living organisms whose implementation is similar to the mechanical devices described
 inamen se adhikansh aisi vishisht koshikaayen hai jo nimna ke prati samvedansheel hai: Artificial sensors that mimic biological sensors using biological sensitive components are called biosensors

 The cornerstone behind his movement was a firm belief in a universal concept of God

 a true visionary with ideas ahead of his time, he is one that conforms to one and all flourishing society at the peak of development
 ek mahaan rahasywaadee ja rahaa he, ke alaava guru basavannapradhanmantri ne dakshini Kalachuri samrajya dakshin bharat main gaya tha or ek saahitiyik kranti Vachana sahitya shuru karne se utpann
 Guru Basavanna is a man of letters by nature, choice, a politician by profession, a humanist by taste, sympathy and a social reformer by punishment is said to have been a mystic by an idealist
 kai mahaan yogiyon or samay ke rahasywaadee yah ki bhagwaan he or jivan main dekhne kaa ek nayaa tarika ko paribhaashit Vachanas ke rup main divya anubhav kaa saar ke saath samrudh apane andolan main shaamil ho gaye
 The path of Guru Basavanna is later given birth to a new religion called Lingavanta Dharma or Lingayata
 Lingayata ke liye anya samanarthak shabd hai: basav dharm, Sharana dharm, Vachana dharm
 Guru Basavanna was born in 1134 in a Shaivite Kamme Brahmin family living in the small town of Ingaleshwar, Bagewadi grew up in northern Karnataka, Guru Basavanabijapur district to wear Janivara as a strict, religious house where he is known as a sacred thread Was made unhone Janivara ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 He rejected agamas on the basis of religion, scriptures and rules which were written in Sanskrit and were out of reach for the common people
 vah sanskaar ke anushthan ko sweekaar nahin kiya
 Srinivasa Murthy, in his book 'vachana Dharma Sara' writes: Vachana Sahitya is not borrowed from other languages, they are the Original and Unique to Kannada language
 What ever is there in Vedas and Upanishads is available in Vachanas, but what ever is there in Vachanas is not there in Vedas and Upanishads
 Guru Basavanna with his original and creative thinking added much value to Kannada language through Vachana Sahitya
 He left Bagewadi and spent the next 12 years studying Sangameshwara, Kudala Sangama in the then-shaivite stronghold
 vahaan he, unhone vidwaanon ke saath conversed or apane saamaajik samaj ke saath sahyog main unke aadhyatmik or dharmik vichaaron kaa vikaas kiya
 Játavéda Muni, also known as Eeshánya Guru, helped him obtain education

 Basvanna is a guru

 Ishtalinga is very different from Sthavaralinga and Charalinga
 Ishtalinga parameshwar ke saarvbhaumik pratik he
 This statue does not represent any Hindu deities
 Sthavaralinga Dhyana mudra main shiv kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 Charalinga is the smaller of Sthavaralinga
 Veerashaivas Chara Linga jo Ishtalinga se alag he pahanane ke liye istemaal kiya he
 Chara Linga did not remove untouchability
 basavannagaishtaling untouchability ke unmoolan, sabhi maanav jati, aadhyatmik gyaan or samaaj seva praapt karne ke liye ek saadhan ke rup main prayog kiya jaataa ke bich samanta sthapit karne ke liye istemaal kiya
 All the works of Basavanna gave very different form to Veerashaivism which gave rise to Lingayatism
 apane vichaar vishwaas he vahaan keval ek hi sach he, sahi bhagwaan shaamil; iske atirikt, ve log hai, jo untouchability, andhvishwaas, bhram, mandir samskruti or pujari ko hataane kii tarah saamaajik sevaaon pradarshan banaaya he
 He believed that people who were looking for the need to show a false god would be rightfully there
 vah maanav jati ke bich samanta kaa prachaar or jati, dharm or yon sambandh, sabhi baadhaon kii ninda kii jati vyavastha ke khilaaf lard rahe the
 He is also known as Krantikari Guru Basavanna for his revolution in the 12th century social system
 guru basavannidaalat Kalachuri ke raja Bijjala, kalyani Chalukya ke ek feudatory main Mangalaveda par ek accountint ke rup main apana karier shuru kiya
 When Bijjala Basavakalyan, in power, was strongly acquired by Tailapa IV, Basavanna also went to Kalyan
 apni eemaandaaree, kadi mehnat or doordarshee mishan ke saath, jo 1162 se shashan raja Bijjala, kii adaalat main pradhanmantri kii sthiti ke liye basav gulab-1167 kalyaan par
 There, he founded Anubhava Mantapa, a spiritual parliament to openly discuss Lingayatism, which attracted many ascetics in India
 vah siddhant Káyakavé Kailása main vishwaas ; ek kadam aage rabindranath tagore ke 'kaam he' puja kii
 It is at this time that the Vachanas were written, simple and easy-to-understand poetic writings which contained essential teachings
 neeche likhaa tha ki Vachanas ke hajaaron main se ek buddha dharm par aadhaarit he: Basava so much controversy was created by actively ignoring the rules associated with the social caste system, which he wished to end
 Untouchables apane nivas par dopaher ke bhojan ke liye anumati dene or ek brahman mahila or ek achhut aadmi kii aitihaasik shaadi kii prashansa karke, basav roodhiwaadee sadasyon ke raja Bijjala adaalat kaa raja aisi kahaniyaan, kuch sach he or kuch galat ke saath jane ke liye kaaran he
 Bijjala, in a possible conservative society, ordered the newly married couple to be harshly punished for fear of rebellion
 kuch ko dandit karne se pehle Bijjala basav jati vyavastha ke saath sahamat karne ke liye kaha; lekin basav joardaar jati vyavastha kaa virodh kiya tha or kaha ki donon Haralayya or Madhuvaras Lingayats the or jati vyavastha ke niyam unhen karne ke liye lagu nahin kiya gaya he
 Bijjala did not agree with Basavanna's ideas; And Basavanna is silent and accepts punishment for some or asked to leave Kalyan
 "sajaa hone ke naate" basvakalyanke saath ek baari dil chhod diya he or Kudala Sangama kii ore chadhaai

 Basava said that the roots of social life are not embedded in the cream of society but in the scum of society
 yah apni mazaakia kah rahi he ki gaay ke doodh uske jo apni peeth par baithta he dena nahin he, lekin yah use jo apane pairon par squats doodh detaa he
 With his wide sympathy, he admitted to his fold alike high and low
 Anubhava Mantapa basav dwaara kii sthapana kii neeche saamaajik loktantr kii neenv rakhi
 Basava believed that man becomes great not by his birth but by his values society
 yah aadmi or vishwaas he ki ek aam aadmi kii sthiti ke ek aadmi ke rup main ke rup main acha samaaj ke ek bhaag ke sammaan main vishwaas kaa matlab he
 He declared that all members of the state are laborers: some may be intellectual laborers and others manual laborers
 vah abhyaas ke niyam se pehle rakhaa he or apane jivan kii kathor tha rectitude
 basav home self-purification kaa sabak karne ke liye apane deshavaasiyon laayaa he
 He tried to raise the moral standard of public life in the country and he insisted that the same rules of conduct apply as separate administrators to members of society
 vah bhi puja ke rup main kaam par jor de dwaara minial shram kii garima sikhaaya
 Every kind of manual labor, which was seen by upper caste people, should be viewed with love and respect, he argues
 is prakaar kala or shilp nikharaa he or ek nai neenv bhoomi ke arthshaastra ke itihaas main rakhi gai thi
 Basava formed people's committees representing various occupations such as agriculture, horticulture, sewing, weaving, dyeing and carpentry
 sabhi vyavsaayon samaan mulya ke rup main mana gaya or sadasyon ke sabhi prakaar ke vyavsaayon ke liye tha
 Thus Jedara Dasimayya a weaver, Shankar Dasimayya a tailor, Madivál Máchayya a people, Myadar Ketayya a basket-maker, Kinnari Bommayya a goldsmith, Vakkalmuddayya a farmer, Hadap Appanna a barber, Jedar Madanna a soldier, Ganada Kannappa an oilman, Doharakk a tanner, Mydar Channayya was a cobbler and Ambigara Chowdayya was a ferryman
 vahaan the unke sambandhit vyavsaayon ke saath aise Satyakka, Ramavve or Somavve ke rup main mahilaon ke anuyaayiyon he
 The interesting thing is that all these and many more sang a very evocative fantasy in Vachanas about their occupations

 But this is only a literal translation
 yah paribhaasha kii Kudala Sangama dwaara basavannako dekhte hue deva ke liye feet nahin he
 Basavanna defines God as: is Vacana main, yah spasht he ki, guru basav bana diya he nahin bhagwaan kii baithak nadiyon main Kudala Sangamadeva
 vah anant, anant or shaareerik indriyon kii pahunch se baahar he
 Basavanna as Ishtalinga gives the right shape to the formless and perfect God
 is prakaar Ishtalinga anant, omnipresence he or nirpeksh parameshwar kaa pratinidhitiv karata he
 The Times of India has paid a glowing tribute to Basava in its issue dated 17 May 1918: andolan Anubhava Mantapa ke madhyam se basav dwaara shuru kiya pyaar or vishwaas kaa ek sampradaay ke aadhaar ban gaya
 It gave rise to a system of once simple and noble on ethics and education

 The first objective, Ceres, was not discovered by any member of the group, but in 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi, director of the Palermo Observatory in Sicily, because of the accident

 Later that year, Carl Friedrich Gauss used these observations to calculate the orbit of this unknown object, which was found between the planets Mars and Jupiter

 They also found 6 Hebe at least two years after that, other astronomers joined the search and every year thereafter at least one new asteroid was found

 This dramatically increased the rate of detection compared to earlier visual methods: Wolf discovered only 248 asteroids, beginning with 323 brucia, while by that time only a little over 300 had been discovered
 That there were many more, but most astronomers did not bother with them, calling them "skies of the sky", attributing different phrases to Eduard Suess and Edmund Waze

 As smaller planets were discovered in the outer solar system and found volcanic-based surfaces that were similar to comets, they often differed from asteroids in the asteroid belt

 Asteroids are differentiated from comets and metroids
 In the case of comets, the difference is one of composition: while the asteroid is primarily composed of minerals and rock, comets are made up of dust and ice
 In addition, asteroids are closer to the sun
 Formed, which prevents the growth of comet ice mentioned above

 In this model the intractable risk of the asset, which is often represented by 'beta' in the finance sector, is taken into account and also the expected return on the market and the expected return on the theoretical risk-free asset

 CAPM is a model for pricing a single asset or group of assets
 akeli pratibhuti ke liye, ham pratibhuti bazaar rekha tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh va systematic jokhim ke saath uske sambandh kaa prayog yah jaanane ke liye karte hai ki bazaar ke dwaara kisi ek pratibhuti kii keemat uski jokhimshrenee kii tulana main kitni nirdhaarit hogi
 The yield-risk ratio can also be calculated from the securities market line compared to the entire market of a single asset
 atah jaise jaise kisi sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratilabh uske beta kofishent dwaara ghatata chalaa jayega, is akeli sampatti kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat, sampurna bazaar ke pratifal-jokhim anupaat ke baraabar hota chalaa jayega
 Like this: bazaar kaa pratifal-jokhim anupaat hi prabhavi taur par bazaar jokhim adhimulya / premium he or uparokt sameekaran ko punah niyojan karne par tathaa e kaa maan nikaalane par, hamen poonjigat parisampatti keemat nirdhaaran model praapt ho jaataa he
 Where: yadi isi ko jokhim premium ke drushtikon se punarlekith kiya jaae, to ham pate hai ki: That is, the "own risk premium" of an asset - the product of "market risk premium" and "beta"
 note 1: bazaar ke pratyaashit pratifal kaa anumaan praayah kisi bazaar-portpholio ke aitihaasik pratifalon ke maan kaa gyometric ausat nikaalkar lagaaya jaataa he
 Note 2: The 'risk-free rate of return' used to calculate risk is often the arithmetic average of historical rates and not the current rate
 For the full derivation see Modern portfolio theory
 The CPM can be modified to include size overload and specific risk
 yah un niveshkon ke liye mahatvapurn he jinke paas ek unnat-vishakhit portpholio nahin he
 The equation is very similar to the traditional CAPM equation "in which market risk weighting is replaced by multiplication of beta product and market risk weighting:": 5 "jahaan: The securities market line depicts the CPM formula as a graph
 x aksh par jokhim ko dikhaate hai or y aksh par pratyaashit pratilabh
 Market risk is estimated by the slope of the securities market line
 β tathaa pratyaashit pratilabh ke madhya sambandh kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha par kiya jaataa he, jo ki pratyaashit pratilabh ko β ke falan ke rup main pradarshit karata he
 The intercept is the nominal risk-free rate available in the market, while the slope is the market premium, E− Rf
 esa kaha ja saktaa he ki pratibhuti bazaar rekha as representing a single-factor model of the asset price ko dikhaati he, jabaki β se pataa chalata he ki uski bazaar main parivartanon se prabhavit hone kii sambhaavna kitni he is prakaar SML kaa sameekaran is prakaar he: It is a very important tool in such situations when it is to find out whether a asset / security will give an acceptable return compared to the risk
 akeli parisampattiyon kaa chithran pratibhuti bazaar rekha graph par kiya jaataa he
 If the mutual depiction of risk and return is above the line, it means that the security is getting cheaper and more profit can be expected on it
 yadi chithran rekha se neeche aa pade to mulya ko manhagaa samajha janaa chahie tathaa isamen utana laabh nahin milegaa jitna ki jokhim uthaaya ja rahaa he
 After knowing the expected / desired profit rate e { \ displaystyle E} using CAPM, it can be compared to the expected return rate of the asset to determine whether the investment is good or not
 iske liye hamen sampatti ke pratilabh ke swatantra anumaan kii gananaa kii aavashyaktaa hogi jo ki praayah fundamental athwa technical vishleshan, anupatik vishleshan aadi ke dwaara kii jaati he
 According to CAMP, if the estimated value is equal to the future cashflow adjusted with the rate suggested by the asset's CAPM - then the asset is meeting at the right price
 yadi anumaanit mulya siepiem moolyankan se adhik he to sampatti sasti he 
 An asset not located on the securities market line indicates a discrepancy in its value
 chunki samaybindu t { \ displaystyle t} par sampatti kaa pratyaashit pratifal e = e − p t p t { \ displaystyle E={ \ frac {e-p_{t}}{p_{t xxrep 4 } jo ki siepim dwaara sujhaaye pratifal se adhik he, to iskaa arth he ki p t { \ displaystyle P_{t}} bahut kam he, assuming that at time t + 1 { \ displaystyle t+1} the asset returns to the CAPM suggested price
 Using CAPM, the value of the asset p 0 { \ displaystyle P_ {0}}, can be displayed with the following linear relation: jahaan p t { \ displaystyle P_{T}} sampatti yaa portpholio kaa payoff he
 It can be found out by the CAMP that what should be the expected return ie adjustment rate, taking into account the relative risk of a particular asset
 yadi beta kaa maan ek se adhik ho to iskaa arth he - ausat se adhik jokhim; ek se kam kaa arth he - ausat se kam jokhim
 Thus, a higher risk stock will have a higher beta and will be adjusted at a higher rate
 jabaki kam samvedansheel stox kaa beta kam hoga or unhen kam dar par samyojit kiya jayega
 This is in line with the prevailing informal assumption that high risk-taking investors desire higher returns
 kyonki beta kisi ek parisampatti ke jokhim kii puure bazaar jokhim ke prati samvedansheeltaa kaa paimaana he, to paribhaasha se spasht he ki bazaar jokhim kaa beta kaa maap hoga : 1
 The stock market index is used extensively as a complementary measure to measure market risk, hence its beta measure is 1
 is prakaar, ek bade or suvishakhit portpholio ke niveshak apane nivesh se bazaar kii chaal ke anusaar hi parinaamon kii apeksha kar sakate hai
 The risk in any portfolio is primarily the sum of two types of risk - systemic risk, also known as market risk or non-intangible risk, and disorderly risk known as branchial risk
 vyavasthaatmak yaa bazaar jokhim un kaarnon kii vajah se hota he jo samast nivesh vikalpon arthath puure bazaar ko prabhavit karte he
 This type of risk is difficult to control
 avyavashthaatmak jokhim vah jokhim he jo kisi vishesh pratibhuti athwa nivesh vikalp ko prabhavit karata he
 Such risk can be controlled by diversifying the investment
 a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk, as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model
 Therefore, the required return on an asset, that is, the return that compensates for risk taken, must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i
e
 its contribution to overall portfolio riskiness—as opposed to its "stand alone risk
" In the CAPM context, portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i
e
 less predictability
 In other words the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor
 CAPM assumes that the risk-return ratio of an investment can be corrected, an ideal portfolio would be one with minimal risk to a defined return rate
 iske atirikt, kyonki portpholio main judane vaali har nai sampatti portpholio kaa or vishaakhan karti he, since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio, the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset, with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above 
 All such optimal portfolios, i
e
, one for each level of return, comprise the efficient frontier
 Because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable, the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta
 koi niveshak esa bhi kar saktaa he ki vah apni nidhi kaa kuch hissaa to jokhimayukt sampattiyon main nivesh kare tathaa kuch hissaa nakad bachaakar rakhe, jise jokhim rahit dar par kamai hoti rahe
 
 yahan par jokhimayukt va jokhimamukt kaa anupaat overall return ko nirdhaarit nahin karata - yah sambandh nishchit hi linear he
 In this way it is possible that a certain return can be achieved by any one of the following types: haalaanki ek nishchit pratilabh ke liye, uparokt main se koi ek vikalp hi kushal siddh hoga 
 Since the risk-free asset is not necessarily correlated with any other asset, the second option will usually have less deviation, which would make it more efficient of the two
 yah sambandh prabhavi seemaa par sthit anya portpholios ke liye bhi sahi hoga : ucch pratilabh ke saath kuch nakad- adhik kushal he bajaay - usee pratilabh dar par maatr nimna pratilabh vaale portpholio ke
 For a fixed risk-free rate, there will be only one efficient portfolio that can be combined with cash to achieve a minimum risk position for any return
 yahi market portpholio he
 All investors: dwi-beta model urdhvagami beta ko adhigami beta se bhinn karata he
 The difference between the CPM and bi-beta models is that the CPM model recognizes that the upward and the succeeding betas are the same, whereas the bi-beta model does not believe so
 asi manyata kabhi virale hi thik hoti he, atah dwi-beta model ko hi adhik upyukt mana jaataa he

 vah 16 agast 1781 kaa din tha
 Suddenly the news spread like lightning in the entire Kashi city that the British officer of East India Company Warren Hastings had arrested Kashi Naresh Maharaj Chet Singh in his palace at Rajmahal
 kaaran tha, hestings kii ghoose-khori
 This British was notorious for collecting bribes from Indian kings with both hands in those days
 maharaj chet singh se bhi isane jhuthe dosha madhkar 50 lakh rupye jurmaane ke naam par vasuulne chaahe, jise unhone dene se inkaar kiya to hestings 4 company sena sahit 14 agast ko kaashi aa dhamka or vahaan madhodas satiya ke baag main padaav daalaa, joki gola deenanath ke sannikat tha
 It took him more than a month to reach Kashi via Calcutta by river
 vah kalakatta se 5 july ko chalaa tha
 On 16 August, he took Chet Singh captive
 vahiin kashivasi pralayankar bhagwaan vishweshwar vishwanath ke aise bhakt the jo gomance bhakshak angrejon ko sabak sikhaanaa jaanate the
 Thousands of Kashivians laid siege to Warren Hastings and his army with whatever weapon they had
 angrej asaavdhaan the or ghamand main chur the
 The people of Kashi fought fiercely against the British for 4 consecutive days, in which hundreds of British were cut off
 hestings ke hosh ud gaye or use apni jaan ke laale pad gaye
 Then she threw away the coat-pant-hat, dressed as a woman and sat in a curtained sedan like a Janani ride
 us palki ko dhone waalon ko kaha gaya ki "bibi ji devi-darshan ke liye vindhyachal devi ke darshanath ja rahi hai
 "in this way, Hastings Chunar disguised as a dagger and came back to Calcutta again from the water route
 chet singh kaashi ke jan-bal sahit angrejon par baari pade or janata ne hi unhen shivala ke mahal se mukt karaayaa
 Since then, Kashiwasi said these lines in memory of that historic victory - "ghode par hoda, hathi par jin, Warren Hastine, fleeing Kashi
 
 " arthath ki bhaybheet warren hestings ko kaashi se bhaagate samay aisi ghabrahat hui ki hathi kaa houdah usne rakhwaya ghode par or ghode kii jin kasavai hathi par or kaashi se bhaag niklaa
 The heroism of Warren Hastings and Kashi ghode par houdah-hathi par jin / chupake se bhaaga warren hesting
 ye kahawat aaj bhi banaras qi galiyon main puraane logon ke bich lokapriy he
 There is a story behind this
 kehete hai ki aaj se lagbhag do sau tees saal pehle kaashi rajya qi tulana desh qi badi riyasaton main qi jaati thi
 From the geographical point of view, the state of Kashi was the heartland of India
 jise dekhte hue un dinon british sansad main yah baat uthaai gai thi ki yadi kaashi rajya british hukumat ke haath aa jaye to unki arth vyavastha tathaa vyapaar kaa kaaphi vikaas hoga
 After this discussion, the then Governor General Warren Hastings was sent to take over India
 kaashi rajya par hukumat karne ke liye agrejon ne tatkaaleen kaashi naresh se dhai ser chiti ke sar kaa tel yaa phir iske badale ek moti rakam qi maang rakhi
 Kashi King Raja Chet Singh had already realized the intention of enslaving India by the British
 atah unhone rakam tak dene se saaf manaa kar diya lekin unhen laga ki angrej unke rajya par akraman kar sakate hai, isi ko maddenjar rakhte hue kaashi naresh ne maratha, peshwa or gwalior jaisi kuch badi riyasaton se sampark kar is baat ki sandhi kar lee thi ki yadi zarurat padi to in firangiyon ko bharat se khadedane kaa puri koshish karenge
 On 14 August 1781, the day Saturday, General Warren Hastings arrived at Kashi from the Ganges waterway with a large military band
 usne kabirchaura ke madhav das kaa baag ko apana thikaana banaaya
 It is said that an employee named Ausan Singh, who was expelled from the court of King Chet Singh, went to Calcutta to meet Warren Hastings and became his confidant, who was also awarded the title of "king" by the British
 usee ke madhyam se angrejon ne kaashi pahunchne ke baad kaashi naresh rajachet singh ko giraftaar karne qi sajeesh rachi 
 din ravivaar, taarikh 15 agast 1781 qi subah warren hesting ne apane ek angrej adhikari markeham ko ek patr de kar raja chetsingh ke paas se dhai kilo chiti ke sar kaa tel yaa phir uske badale ek moti rakam laane ko bheja
 us patr main hesting ne raja chetsingh par rajasatta ke durupyog or shadyantr kaa aarope lagaaya
 In response to the letter, the King revealed his ignorance of the conspiracy
 On that day i
e
 15 August, correspondence between Raja Chet Singh and Warren Hastings continued throughout the day
 duusare din 16 agast ko sawan kaa antim somvaar, har saal qi tarah raja chet singh apane ramnagar kile qi bajaay shankar bhagwaan qi puja archana karne ganga ke is paar chote kile shivalaghat aae the
 There was also a small office of his tehsil in this fort
 kehate hai ki jis samay kaashi naresh shivapujan se nivruth ho kar apane darbar main kaamkaaj dekh rahe the, ki usee samay governor warren hesting qi sena unke darbar main pravesh karne kii koshish karne lagi lekin kaashi ke sainikon ne unke napak mansuubo ko kaamyaab nahin hone diya
 Then an English resident expressed his desire to meet Raja Saheb and said that he had come with a necessary message from the Governor, but the soldiers suspected that he had brought such an army
 In response to this, the resident started a new trick by saying that the army has moved with him in the same way, only two-three officers will come to the fort
 On this, on the orders of Raja Saheb, he was sent to the fort
 baton hi baton main donon ore se talavaarein khinch gayi, isi dauraan ek angrej adhikari ne raja chet singh ko lakshya kar bandook tani, jab tak uski anguli bandook ke trigar par dabati ki uske pehle kaashi ke mahashur gunde babu nanhaku singh qi talwaar ke ek hi waar se us angrej adhikari kaa sar cat kar dan se jameen par aa gira, chaaron ore khun hi khun bikhar gaya, jise dekh kar khun se sane angrej adhikari cheekhte-chillaate ulte paanv baahar bhaage
 udhar kile ke baahar chaaron taraf chhipe kintu satark kaashi ke vir ranbankuron ne dekh kar ye samaj liya ki andar kile main maar-kaat much gai he
 What was then, all the hawks fell on the white skinned people, but who killed whom, could not be found till today, but the British inscribed it on the inscription on the outside of the fort on Shivala Ghat that this place But nearly two hundred soldiers, including three British officers Lieutenant Stocker, Lieutenant Scott and Lieutenant George Semlas, were killed
 is ghatana ke turant baad raja kaashi naresh ke mantri babu maniyar singh ne governor warren hesting ko giraftaar karne qi salaah raja sahib ko di, lekin unke dewan bakshi sadanand ne unhen aisa karaane se manaa kar diya
 On the other hand, Warren Hasting asked Pandit Beni Ram, the owner of "madhav Das Bagh", to go to Chunar for fear of being caught
 Meanwhile, he came to know that a large army of Raja Saheb is coming in this direction to arrest him
 kehete hai ki apni giraftaar ke dar se warren hesting usee madhav das baag ke bheetar bane ek kune main kud gaya or jab raat hui to wo stri kaa bhesh dhaaran kar chunaar qi ore kooch kar gaya
 The advice of King Chet Singh's Diwan Bakshi Sadanand not to arrest Warren Hastings was unfortunate for India
 agar us din warren hesting kaashi naresh qi sena ke haathon giraftaar kar liya gaya hota to shaayad angrejon ke paanv bharat main hi zamane nahin pate
 The interesting thing is that the British historians have proved Kashi Naresh Raja Chet Singh as a fugitive and on the other hand, in the shilapatta installed on the Shivala Ghat, it was clearly written that "two hundred soldiers including three of his officers were killed at this place
" Were
 jise aaj bhi dekha ja saktaa he lekin wo warren hesting ke bhagoda hone qi baat par chuppi saadh gaye
 If we consider this incident, the first bugle of the freedom movement was played in Kashi, but unfortunately it is that no memorial has been built here till date in memory of that incident
 haan is din yani 16 agast ko jin parivaar ke purvajon ne swatantraaa ke liye us din apni qurabaani di thi unke parijan zarur ek "deepak" unki yaad main jalaate hai
 That pride saga still goes on like this, ghode par houdah, hathi par jin, chupake se bhaaga warren hesting

4 Katri Amethi Kohana is a village in Farrukhabad, Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh
 kurm avatar ko 'kacchap avatar' bhi kehete hai
 In the incarnation of Kurma, Lord Vishnu held the Mandar mountain on his armor at the time of the ocean of Kshirsagar
 is prakaar bhagwaan vishnu, mandar parvat or vasuki naamak sarp kii sahaayta se devon env asuron ne samudr manthan karke chaudaa ratnonki prapti kii
 At this time Lord Vishnu also took the form of Mohini
 narsinghpurana ke anusaar kurmavatar dwitiya avatar he jabaki bhagwatpurana ke anusaar gyarahavaan avatar
 It is mentioned in the Shatapatha Brahmana, Mahabharata and Padmapuran that Prajapati, for breeding the progeny, takes the form of a tortoise and transmits it in water
 lingapurana ke anusaar prithvi rasaatal ko ja rahi thi, tab vishnu ne kacchaparup main avatar liya
 The circle of the back of the said Kachchap was one lakh yojana
 padmapurana main varnan hai ki indra ne durvasa dwaara pradutt parijatak maala kaa apmaan kiya to kupit hokar durvasa ne shaap diya, tumhaara vaibhav nasht hoga
 As a result Lakshmi disappeared into the sea
 pashchaat vishnu ke aadeshaanusaar devataaon tathaa daityon ne lakshmi ko pun: praapt karne ke liye mandarachal kii mathani tathaa vasuki kii door banaakar kshirsagar kaa manthan kiya
 While churning out the Mandarachal abyss, Vishnu held it on his back in the form of a tortoise and the Devadanavas edited the former glory by acquiring 14 gems including nectar and Lakshmi from the sea
 ekadshi kaa upwas lok main kachmpavataar ke baad hi prachlit hua
 In the Korampurana, Vishnu in his Kachhapavatar described the four goals of life with the sages
 devraj indra ke shaury ko dekh rishi durvasa nen unhen parijaat pushp kii maala bhent kii parantu indra nen ise grahan na karte hue airavat ko pahana diya or airavat nen use bhoomi par phenk diya, durvasa ne isse krodhit hokar devataaon ko shraap de diya, inke devataaon par abhishaap ke kaaran, devataaon ne apni shakti kho di
 Frustrated with this, he reached Brahma for guidance
 unhone devataaon ko bhagwaan vishnu se sampark karne ko kaha
 Vishnu advised them to churn the Ksheer Samudra which would yield nectar
 is amrit ko pine se devon kii shakti waapas aa jaaegi ar ve sadaa ke liye amar ho jaayenge
 This huge work could only be done with the help of Mandar Parvat and Vasuki, where the mountain was used as a stick of Mathini and Vasuki as a rope
 is kaary ke liye asuron kaa bhi sahaara avashyak tha or iske kaaran sabhi devtaa aatankit ho gaye
 But Vishnu explained to them and the Asuras agreed to help the Devas at the behest of them, in the greed of nectar
 ve samudr kaa manthan karne lage, jahaan ek taraf asur the or dusri taraf dev the
 But due to this churn, a deadly poison started coming out which caused suffocation and threatened the whole world
 lekin bhagwaan mahadev bachaav ke liye aae or us zehar kaa seven kiya or apane kanth main use barkaraar rakhaa jisase unka nilkanth naam padaa
 The churning continued but the mountain began to sink slowly
 tabhi bhagwaan vishnu ne kurm avatar main avateern hue ek vishaal kachhue kaa avatar liya taaki apane peet kar pahaad ko uthaa saken
 The diameter of that turtle's back was 100,000 joints

 phuko kii ginati 20 veen sadi ke sabase pramukh vichaarkon main se kii jaati hai
 It was the influence of Fuko's writings that revolutionary changes took place in many areas of modern science, and especially in the field of history writing
 rajya kii sanstha logon se kaise apni baat manawaati he— is samaj main sabase taaja or vicharottejak vikaas mishael phuko ne kiya he
 The bourgeoisie does not establish its social power in the state only through instruments of violence
 vah tarah-tarah ke saanskrithik roopon kaa istemaal karke bhi apni saamaajik satta kii nirantarata sunishchit karata he
 Therefore it is also necessary to understand the structures of the state in their cultural forms
 antatah rajya ke paksh main sahmati paidaa karne kii zimmedaari ye saanskrithik sanrachanaayen hi nibhaati hai
 Fuko explains that in order to control or discipline people in modern society, a multi-layered system of surveillance, besides assimilating the decisions made by others and the examination system, are adopted
 phuko jor dekar kehete hai ki logon par drushti rakhane maatr se satta kaa aadha kaam puraa ho jaataa he
 For this, he cites the arrangement of the stadium in which the seats are arranged in such a way that the audience can easily watch an event but at the same time this system also provides the power controllers to keep an eye on the audience
 yahan phuko anushaasan or niyantran kii satta kaa model chihnit karne ke liye raajnneetik chintak jeremi bantham dwaara kalpit jail panopticon kaa ullekh bhi karte hai
 The original Vastu-plan was such that the prisoners kept in the cells should be invisible to each other but could not be out of the prison's central tower
 kaidiyon ko kabhi is baat kaa pataa nahin chalata ki un par nigaah rakhi ja rahi he yaa nahin par unke mastishk main yah baat baith jaati he ki koi un par drushti rakhata he
 Fuco views the Panoptican doctrine as a metaphor that transcends the prison boundary and becomes a common pattern of discipline in schools, factories and hospitals
 haalaanki bantham kii yah prastaavit jail kabhi moort rup nahin le paayi lekin ek siddhant ke rup main vah aadhunik samaaj kii lagbhag har gatividhi par kabizj ho gayi he
 He has proved to be a tool for disciplining systems in modern society, which has overthrown the kings and princes of the pre-modern period and has established himself in their place
 is kram main phuko yah bhi darshaate hai ki aadhunik satta yaa anushaasan kaayam karne vaali vyavastha keval logon kii gatividhiyon par hi nazar nahin rakhti balki vah logon ko unki aakshamata dikhaakar bhi niyantrit karti he
 According to him, modern power creates categories like understanding, talent, normal and unusual behavior, and when a person does not meet the criteria or standards established by it, the system does not miss an opportunity to declare such person as inferior or abnormal
 is sandarbh main phuko yah yaad dilaanaa nahin bhoolatey ki aadhunik samaaj kii in anushaasankaree sansthaaon kaa yah ravaiya kisi tarah ke pratishodh se nahin balki sudhaar se prerit hota he
 The ultimate goal of which is that the person accepts the norms or standards provided by the society
 dhyaan den ki samaaj kii manyataon ke dwaara anushaasan kaayam karne kaa yah dhang nyaayik dand kii us vyavastha se khaasaa alag he jisamen kisi vyakti ko keval is aadhaar par dandit kiya jaataa tha ki uskaa krity kanoon sammat he yaa nahin
 In such a decision it was not said that the person is normal or abnormal
 lekin aadhunik samaaj shaikshik kaaryakramon, chikitsa ke taur-tareekon tathaa udyog va utpaadon ke maamalon main kuch nishchit maanak sthapit karne par jor detaa he or in maanakon kaa varchasv itnaa chautarfa hota he ki vyakti kaa vyavhaar or vyaktitv unheen ke hisaab se dhalane lagata he
 The state is generally seen as a governance, organization or political community
 mana jaataa he ki itihaas ke har daur main iske vividh rup maujuud rahe hai
 Changes in this have been the major subjects of history
 sirf aadim ghumantu raajnneetik samudaayon ko rajya kaa darza nahin diya jaataa he
 It is believed that in these communities, there is a lack of a definite system associated with this concept
 asal main rajya hone ke liye yah aavashyak he ki samudaay or bhu-kshetra ke bich takreeban sthai sambandh ho
 When used in this general way, the term expresses the idea that the political community has certain universal characteristics that go beyond time and space; That is, Greek polis, some common features between medieval regnums and modern republics
 kya is gun yaa visheshta ko zyaada sankuchit rup main paribhashit kiya ja saktaa he? It is clear that if a definition of the state presents it as an eternal and immutable object or organization, by doing so it ignores the process of change and development in history
 isliye ek vaid paribhaasha ko duusare pahaluon or kaaryon par dhyaan dena chahie
 History shows that the state as a universal phenomenon is an activity or organization imposed on human beings as necessities
 is tarah kii gatividhi ke rup main isaki kuch mukhya visheshtaayen is prakaar hai : yah manushyon or unki sampatti ke bich main ek nishchit sambandh banaata he; yaa duusare shabdon main yah manushyon ke bich ekta yaa samaaj kaa nirmaan karata he
 Therefore the existence of the state is uniquely a fundamental thing
 doosraa, yah manushyon ke bich vyavastha kii shakti, yaa shashan ke ek rup yaa aadesh or ajna paalan kaa ek sambandh sweekaar karata he
 Third, the activity that creates and sustains the state is unique, always presenting itself against people who are not part of this community
 baharhaal, rajya ko ek aitihaasik parighatna ke rup main dekhne ke baavjood is baat se inkaar nahin kiya ja saktaa he ki is par hone vaale lekhan main ek darshanik pahalu hameshaa shaamil rahaa he
 Under this, the question arises that what is the ideal form of the kind of arrangement or the state wants to establish relations between people? Has that ideal form been achieved? Is the present way of governance right? Are the external relations of the community being handled properly? In fact, considering this point of view, not only does the state emerge as a requirement imposed on human beings, but also as a problem of choice of 'right' in front of humans
 rajya main sirf araajaktaa kii jagah ek vyavastha sthapit karne kaa hi sangharsh nahin he
 Instead, it is also a struggle to establish a system that is genuine, authentic and just
 isliye, plato, arestu, hobbs, higel aadi ke lekhan ko is sawaal kaa darshanik uttar khojane kii koshish ke rup main dekha ja saktaa he ki rajya kaisaa hona chahie
 These scholars have tried to differentiate between the state and other types of human organizations and at the same time they have presented the hypothesis of their ideal state and the arguments in its favor
 saarvbhaum aitihaasik parighatna ke rup main rajya or ek darshanik avadharana ke rup main rajya ko dekhne ke vichaar ke saath rajya ko vishesh rup se aadhunik parighatna maanane ke vichaar ko bhi jodne kii aavashyaktaa he
 There are many historians and political theorists who argue that the term 'state' should be used to refer to the post-renaissance and Reformation system in Europe
 inkaa yah maananaa he ki rajya kaa sidghant darasal isi vishisht parighatna se judaa hua sidghant he
 Therefore, if it is used for organizations present in the second round of history, it will lead to confusion about its meaning
 ek sangathit vyavastha ke rup main rajya shabd kaa udai bhi chaudaavin sadi ke ant or satrahavin sadi ke bich hua
 The state's English word 'state' derives from the Latin word 'steer', meaning to stand
 is tarah yah ek sthiti ke bare main bataata he
 One of the main ideas behind considering the state as a modern concept is that the emergence of the modern state coincided with the concept of sovereignty
 yah ek spasht aadhunik manyata he ki jo rajya prabhusatta-sampann nahin he, vah sahi arthon main rajya hi nahin he
 Sovereignty means that the state is the supreme source of political authority in the territory under its purview
 prabhusatta ke do pahalu hai— aantarik pahalu or bahari pahalu
 The internal aspect means that there is no authority higher than the state within the boundaries of the state
 rajya sarvocch he or naagarik rajya ke kilaaf kisi anya praadhikari se apil nahin kar saktaa he
 External sovereignty means the recognition given by other states to a particular state
 saath hi, isamen yah bhi sweekaar kiya jaataa he ki koi rajya antarrashtriya maamalon main apane nagarikon kii ore se bol saktaa he
 This right expresses the autonomy and sovereignty of the state in the international arena
 rajya ko ek aadhunik parighatna maanane kaa matlab yah nahin he ki ise ek aitihaasik satta yaa darshanik vichaar ke rup main bhi kaarij kar diya jaye
 It also cannot be said that no feature of the modern state was present in the earlier period of history
 asal main, aadhunik daur ke pehle ke ‘rajya’ or aadhunik daur ke saath saamne aaye ‘rajya’ kii kai visheshtaayen samaan hai
 Likewise, it cannot be said that the state as a philosophical idea represents the 'complete concept' of the modern state
 asal main darshanik rup se rajya kii avadharana alag- alag tareekon se kalpit or vivechit kii jaati rahi he
 Liberalists, for example, saw states as a 'neutral' institution, but there has been serious and varied discussion within liberalism about the role of the state
 marxvad ke bheetar bhi rajya ke lekar vaad-vivaad kii samrudgh parampara rahi he
 In this, apart from considering the state as the instrument of the capitalist classes, the debate related to 'relative autonomy of the state' has also been included
 araajaktaavaadiyon ne rajya ko ek aprakritik satta maane hue ise puri tarah khatm karne kii vakaalat kii he
 Even in the writings of marx-engels, a communist situation has been envisaged in which the state will be completely destroyed
 lekin araajaktaavaadi aisi kisi sthiti kaa intazaar karne kii bajaay rajya ko jald-se-jald khatm karnaa chaahate hai
 They believe that the state is based on violence against the natural nature of man
 duusari ore, anudaarataavaadi rajya kii tarafadaari isliye karte hai taaki vah kai pidiyon se sanchit paramparaon or mulyon kaa sangrakshan kar paye
 The state has been thought of differently in the various streams within feminists
 udhaaharan ke taur par, udaarataavaadi-nariwad yah maanata he ki ek sanstha ke rup main rajya purush varchasv kii ore jhukaa hua he, lekin kanoon banaakar rajya kii is pravriti main sudhaar kiya ja saktaa he or iskaa upyog purush-mahila samanta sthapit karne ke liye kiya ja saktaa he
 On the other hand, socialist-feminism considers the capitalist character of the state as the main reason for the problem of women
 isaki manyata he ki poonjeewaadi rajya khatm karne se hi striyon kii sthiti main sudhaar ho saktaa he
 Third, according to the radical feminist view, the state works to protect the family based on patriarchy and the values it promotes
 isliye pitrusatta ko puri tarah khatm karne ke liye aavashyak he ki rajya ko bhi khatm kiya jaae
 Clearly, there is much varied and intense debate about the state, its nature and role
 haal ke daur main europee union jaisi sanrachanaon ke ubhaar ke kaaran yah tark diya gaya he ki rajya dhire-dhire apraasangik ho rahaa he
 But this argument is not very strong
 yah sach he ki europee union main shaamil deshon ne ek majboot kshetreey sanghathan ko banane ke liye apni sahmati di he
 Nevertheless, they do not want to end their identity as a nation-state
 duusare kai kshetreey sanghathanon ne bhi kshetra ke deshon ke bich sahyog badhaayaa he, lekin is baat kii koi sambhaavna nazar nahin aati he ki ve raashtra-rajya kaa vikalp sabit honge
 In the contemporary world, the state is a reality that has no chance of ending
 vaicharik rup se iskaa virodh karne vaale kai vichaardhaaraon ke anuyaayi vyaavhaarik mauka milane par bhi rajya kii sanstha ko khatm kar paane main naakaam rahe hai

 ek din vah shivangi ke miltaa he or donon ek duusare ke saath pyaar main padate hai
 Soon after, the two get married and settle down to enjoy a married life
 ek raat main bhojan karte samay, jode ko ek purush vishwanath sampark karata he, jo daawa karata he ki shivangi uski patni madhu he
