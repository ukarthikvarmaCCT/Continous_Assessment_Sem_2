 shriimatii= glorious one - city; su vibhaktaa mahaa pathaa= with well, devised, high, ways; mahaa purii= great, city; dasha cha dve= ten, and, two - twelve; yojanaani= yojana-s; aayataa= lengthy; triini vistiirnaa= three in breadth
 That glorious city with well-devised highways is twelve yojana-s lengthwise and three yojana-s breadth wise
 Yojana is an ancient measure of distance, where one yojana roughly equals to 8 to 10 miles
 Its account is like this : 1 angula is 3 / 4 inch; 4 angula-s are = one dhanu graha - bow grip; 8 angula-s are = one dhanu musti - fist with thumb raised; 12 angula-s are = 1 vitasti - distance between tip of thumb and tip of last finger when palm is stretched; 2 vitasti-s = 1 aratni -s - cubit; 4 aratni-s = one danda, dhanus - bow height - 6 ft ; 10 danda-s = 1 rajju 60 ft ; 2 rajju-s = 1 paridesha - 120 ft ; 2, 000 dhanus-s = one krosha, and also called gorata - 4, 000 yards ; 4 krosha-s = 1 yojana - thus one yojana is 9 to 10 miles
 But the British Revenue measurement scaled it down to 5 miles, and all the dictionaries say that one yojana is 5 miles
 But traditionally it is held as 10 miles
 More info on these measures can be had from The Artha Shaastra of Kautilya - a republication of Penguin
 The Teli is traditionally a caste that sells and sells oil in India, Pakistan and Nepal
 sadsy yaa to hindu yaa muslim ho sakate hai; muslim taili ko roshandar yaa taili malik kehete hai
 The Jewish community of Maharashtra was also known as a sub-group in the Teli caste called Sheelvir Teli, ie Saturdays oil providers against their Jewish tradition by working on Shabbat
 taelia ko hindu dharm main vaisya se sambandhit mana jaataa he
 People of some special places relate themselves to the Kshatriyas, while in the Puranas, they are described only in the Vaishya class
 taili jati kaa ullekh pracheen grantho or prachlit kahanio main bhi miltaa he jisase pataa chalata he kii ye vaishyon kii ati puraani jaati he
 People of this caste were very educated and educated
 inkaa samaaj main kaaphi sammanit sthaan hota tha
 In Bengal, Teli is considered as Vaishya, along with other traders and bankers known as Suvarnamanik, Gandhian, Saha, Vaishya varna etc
 Their main occupation was edible oil jaggery and agricultural work etc
 rajasthan main, taili kaa kshatriya kaa darja he Bene Israel of Maharashtra was given the nickname Shanivar Teli by the local populace as they left for work on Saturday, which was the verbiage of Judaism
 gujarat ke modh-ghanchi samudaay ko taili ke "samakaksh" ke rup main varnit kiya gaya he
 In the late 2000s, some of Billy's Teli community, organized by the Teli Army, were involved in vote bank politics as they sought to achieve classification as the most backward class in the state
 prarambh main, ve bharat kii aadhikarik sakaaratmak bhedbhaav yojana main is taatpary ko praapt karne main vifal rahe, vipakshi anya samoohon se aa rahe the jinhone taili ko bahut adhik aabaadi vaale or saamaajik-aarthik rup se prabhaavshaalee mana or parivartan ko sahi tehraaya
 In April 2015, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar decided to include Teli caste in the list of extremely backward classes in Bihar

 This is used by user based code or anonymous user access

 Many recent web browsers and file managers can connect to FTP servers

 FTP URL is used in this

 It was first formulated as RFC 114 on 16 April 1971 which was later replaced with RFC 765 in June 1980 which was converted from RFC 959 in October 1985
 uske baad anek suraksha sambandhi badlaav isamen aae
 These security changes were brought about because initially this method of sending files was very insecure
 is asuraksha kaa pramukh kaaran tha ki sanchika bhejne kii prakriya main koi bhi usee network par us file ko chura yaa nakal kar saktaa tha
 Prior to HTTP, SMTP, and Telnet, this was a common problem faced by Internet protocols
 is samasya kaa nivaaran esaftipi ke dwaara hi sambhav hua
 FTP can be operated in active mode, passive mode and extended passive mode
 refsi 2428 dwaara sitambar 1998 main, vistrut niskriy mod joda gaya tha
 When transferring data over the network, multiple data representations can be made
 do sarvaadhik saamaanya antaran mod hai: FTP server return codes indicate their status by their inner digits
 mul afatipi vinirdesan, sanchikaon ke antaran kii swaabhaavik asurakshit paddati he, kyonki ancrypted dhang se data antarit karne kii koi nirdisht vidhi nahin he
 This means that under most network configurations, usernames, passwords, FTP commands and transferred files can use any packet detector located on the same network using a packet detector
 yah achtitipi, esaimatipi or tailnet jaise esasail ke nirmaan se pehle likhe gaye kai internet protocol vinirdeshon ke liye aam samasya rahi he
 The common solution for this problem is SFTP, or FTPS, which adds SSL or TLS encryption to FTP in the manner specified in RFC 4217
 afatipi seva pradaan karne vaala ek host, atirikt rup se anaam afatipi pahunch uplabdh karaane main sakasham hota he
 When asked for a username, users normally log in to an 'anonymous' account service
 yadhyapi aam taur par prayoktaaon ko password ke evaj main apana i-mail pataa bhejne ke liye kaha jaataa he, to aapurit jaankaree kaa satyaapan thodaa-bahut yaa bilkul nahin kiya jaataa he
 Since modern FTP clients typically hide the anonymous login process from the user, FTP clients can supply fake data as passwords because the application may not know the user's email address
 gofar protocol ko or saath hi saadhaaran fil antaran protocol or fil seva protocol ko bhi, anaam afatipi ke liye ek vikalp ke rup main sujhaayaa gaya he
 Where FTP access is not in use, remote or remote FTP or FTP mail is used
 isamen ek email duusare apatpi sarwar par bheja jaataa he jo apatpi cmand puri karata he or downlod sanchika vaali anulgnak waapas bhejtaa he
 This is especially used where FTP access is restricted
 doorvarti afatipi sarwar ko nishpadit kiye jane vaale afatipi cmand yukt i-mail bheja jaataa he
 It is a mail server that parses incoming e-mail, executes FTP commands and sends back e-mails with a file downloaded as an attachment
 yah spasht rup se ek afatipi client se kam lacheela he, kyonki nirdeshikaon ko parsparik kriya karte yaa adeshon ko sanshodhit karte hue nahin dekha ja saktaa he or uttar main bade sanchika anulagnkon ko mail sarwar ke madhyam se nikalne main bhi samasya ho sakati he
 These days most Internet users have easy access to FTP, so this process is not popular in day-to-day use
 vartmaan main aadhunik or haal hi ke web brouzar or file prabandhak, afatipi sarvaron se jud sakate hai, haalanki unamem apatpies jaise protocol vistaar ke liye samarthan kii kami ho sakati he
 This allows the interface, such as the interface used for local files, to be used to switch remote files over FTP
 yah ek afatipi yuarel ke dwaara kiya jaataa he
 It occurs as: vaikalpik rup se yuarel main password diya ja saktaa he, udaa
: Most web browsers require passive mode FTP, which not all FTP servers are capable of accomplishing
 kuch brouzar keval sanchikaon ko downlod karne kii anumati dete hai, par sarwar main sanchikaon ko aplod karne kaa koi saadhan uplabdh nahin karaate hai
 Representation of port numbers on IP addresses and port commands and PASV reply is another challenge for network address translation tools in dealing with FTP
 eneti upkaran dwaara in maanon ko badalanaa padataa he, taaki ve nat-ed client ke ai-pi pate or data conection ke liye NAT upkaran dwaara chune gaye port ko shaamil karen
 The new address and port may differ from their original address and port in the length of their decimal representation
 iskaa arth yah he ki NAT upkaran dwaara sabhi parvarti packeton ke liye tisipi anukram or pavati fildon ko badalte hue, niyantran conection par maan ko saavdhaanee se badla janaa chahie
 Such translations are not typically performed in most NAT devices, but special application-level gate-ways are available for this purpose
 SSH kii apeksha afatipi ek esaech conection kii apeksha saamaanya afatipi satr ketnal banane ke prayog ko sanderbhit karata he
 FTP uses more than one TCP connection, so tunneling over SSH is particularly difficult
 kai esaech clienton ke saath, niyantran channel ke liye tunnel taiyaar karne kaa prayaas keval channel kii raksha karegaa; jab data sthanantarit hota he, donon chor par afatipi software tisipi conekshnon ko sthapit karenge, jo esaech conection se baahar upmarg par guzarenge or is tarah gopneeyata, akhandta sangrakshan, aadi nahin rahegi
 Otherwise, SSH client software requires specific knowledge of the FTP protocol and monitoring and rewriting FTP control messages and autonomously opening new forwarding for FTP data channels
 esaech sanchaar suraksha ke software parikr kaa sanskaran 3 or jeepiel dwaara licensokrut echoensi, aise do software package hai, jo is vidha kaa samarthan karte hai
 FTP over SSH is sometimes referred to as secure FTP; It should not be considered another method of securing FTP like SSL / TLS
 SSH kaa upyog karte hue sanchikaon ko sthanantarit karne ke anya tareeqon main shaamil hai esafatipi or esasipi, jo afatipi se sambandhit nahin hai; inamen se prayek main, puraa vaartalap hameshaa SSH protocol dwaara surakshit he

 The nature of the temple is similar to that of Khajuraho temples
 yah ek vargakar chabutre par bana he tathaa chaaron taraf se ek diwaar se ghira he
 The main temple has a sanctum sanctorum, then three entrance pavilions on three sides of the hall and hall

 The demolition of a huge mosque is found at Purab, about a distance from the Udayeshwar temple
 ise shahi masjid ke naam se janaa jaataa he
 It is known from a Persian inscription engraved in it that the construction work started in the reign of Jahangir and completed in 1632 during the reign of Shah Jahan
 masjid ke saamne ek bada- sa chabutara bana he, jis par kai kabren bani hui he
 Remains of a huge palace are found near the mosque

 Khurd and Kalan are Persian language words found in many contexts in Hindi and in the Indian subcontinent, especially in place names
 "kurd" kaa matlab "chota" hota he or "kalaan" kaa matlab bada hota he
 These names have been used since Mughal times
 choti aabaadi vaale gaanvon-kasbon ke peeche khurd shabd lagaaya gaya
 This Persian word means small
 yah khurd sanskrit ke kshudra se hi bana he jisamen laghu, chota yaa sookshmata kaa bhav he
 There are thousands of Khurd dhari villages across the country
 isi tarah kai gaanvon ke saath kalam shabd judaa miltaa he jaise kosi kalam, baamaniyaan kalam 
 Just as the word khurd became synonymous with small or small, similarly the word kalan became synonymous with big or huge
 kalam kaa prayog lagbhag usee arth main hota tha jaise bharat ke liye prachinkaal main brihattar bharat shabd kaa prayog hota tha jisamen burma se lekar iran tak kaa samoochaa bhushetra aata tha
 However, a word like Hindustan Kalan is not found in any travelogue
 greater britain kii baat chalati thi to uske upniveshon kaa sandarbh nihit hota tha
 Similarly, the meaning of the word Kalan is also important in the context of rural populations
 kalam multah farsi kaa shabd he jiskaa matlab hota he varisht, bada, deergh yaa vishaal
 However, its etymology is unknown
 kuch sandarbhon main ise semetic bhashaa parivaar kaa bataaya jaataa he or ise ishwar kii mahanata se joda jaataa he
 This is fine on the basis of Kalan's economy, but it is not confirmed by any Semitic metal
 kalam shabd kaa prayog sirf sthanon kaa rutaba bataane ke liye hi nahin hota tha balki vyaktiyon ke naam bhi hote the jaise mirza kalam yaa amir kalam al bukhari jiskaa matlab bukhaara kaa mahaan amir hota he
 Obviously, the word Kalan means great here
 muslim shasankaal main basaahaton ke namakaran kii mahima yaheen khatm nahin hoti
 The names of many villages are associated with the word elders such as Sonpipri elders

 Katappa continues to listen to his story of how he killed Bahubali


 kalkey se jeetne ke baad, mahishmati main amarendra bahubali ko bhavishya kaa raja or bhallaal dev ko senapati ghoshit kar diya jaataa he
 Even before the coronation, Amarendra's mother Shivgami starts searching for her bride
 vah amarendra or katappa ko kahati he ki samrajya kii sthiti or iske logon ko samajhane ke liye iskaa daura karen
 Amarendra falls in love with the princess of the Kuntal kingdom and her king's sister, Devasena
 bhallaal ko pataa chal jaataa he ki amarendra ko devsena se pyaar ho gaya he
 He then tells Shivagami that he wants to marry Devasena
 shivgami ko is bare main nahin pataa hota he ki devsena se amarendra pyaar karata he, is kaaran vah uski shaadi devsena se karaane kaa vaada kar detii he
 When Sivagami sends the marriage proposal to the Kuntal state, the messenger writes the proposal as if an arrogant person wrote it
 devsena is shaadi ke prastaav ko kade shabdon ke saath manaa kar detii he
 When Sivagami gets his answer, she orders to bring Devasena captive in anger
 kuntal samrajya par pinjariyon kaa hamalaa ho jaataa he
 With the help of Devasena's brother Kumar Verma, Amarendra foils the attack and saves Kuntal
 amarendra use bataa detaa he ki vah koun he or shivgami ke krodh ke bhay ko dur karne or use apni dulhan banane hetu raji karne kii koshish karata he
 When he reaches Mahismati, he discovers a misunderstanding
 shivgami use singhaasana yaa devsena main se kisi ek ko chunane bolti he
 He chooses Devasena
 is kaaran bhallaal ko vahaan kaa raja bana diya jaataa he or amarendra ko senapati par phir bhi log use hi raja maanate hai
 Amarendra was discharged by Bhallal as the commander of the army for Devasena's baby shower, so that he could live with his wife
 usee samay devsena raja bhallaal ke herpher ke khilaaf bolti he or shivgami ke chup rahane par bhi sawaal uthaati he
 This causes a quarrel and the two are forced out of the palace
 vah donon baahar logon ke bich khushi se jindagi bitaane lage the, par bhallaal phir se shivgami ko bhadakaata he ki amarendra use maarna chahta he or yah bhi bolta he ki yadi usne sidhi kaarywahi kii to grih yuddh shuru ho saktaa he
 For this reason, Sivagami speaks to Kattappa, his servant, that he is in trouble and has to kill Amarendra
 shivgami ke kehane par katappa ne amarendra kii peeth par dhokhe se hamalaa kar use maar diya
 Katappa then informs Shivgami that Amarendra Bahubali has died
 devsena bhi apane bachche mahendra bahubali ke saath vahaan aati he or use bhi is bare main pataa chalata he
 Shivagami tells the bewildered crowd outside the palace that Amarendra is dead and now his son Mahendra Bahubali will be the new king
 iske baad bhallaal or uske log milakar devsena or uske bachche ko pakad kar karawas main daalane kii koshish karte hai
 Devasena hands his child to Sivagami who manages to escape, but Devasena is unable to save himself
 use kaid kar liya jaataa he
 After 25 years, Mahendra Bahubali, son of Bhallaldev and Amarendra Bahubali, has a fierce battle and Bhallaldev is defeated in this war
 mahendra bahubali kaa rajbhishek hota he or mahismati kaa nayaa raja ban jaataa he

 It is made by heating milk and burning its water
 ab ise utaar kar thanda kar len
 When it cools down it becomes grainy then you can use it
 antarrashtriya sambandh vibhinn deshon ke bich sambandhon kaa adhyayan he, saath hi saath samprabhu rajyon, antar-sarkari sanghathanon, antarrashtriya gaiyr sarkari sanghathanon, gaiyr-sarkari sanghathanon or bahurashtriya companiyon kii bhoomika kaa bhi adhyayan he
 International relations is also sometimes referred to as 'international study'), although the two terms are not entirely synonymous
 saadhaaran shabdon main 'antarrashtriya raajnneeti' kaa arth he 'rajyon ke madhya raajnneeti karnaa'
 If we study the meaning of 'politics' three major elements emerge - the existence of groups; Consent between groups; And fulfill their interests by groups
 is aashay ko yadi antarrashtriya str par akalan karen to ye teen tatv mukhya rup se - rajyon kaa astitv; rajyon ke bich sangharsh; tathaa apane rashtrahiton kii purti hetu shakti kaa prayog
 Therefore, international politics is to study the actions under which states struggle on the basis of power to fulfill their national interests
 is sandarbh main rashtriya hit antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke pramukh lakshya hote hai; sangharsh iskaa disha nirdesh tay karti he; tathaa shakti is uddeshy prapti kaa pramukh saadhan mana jaataa he
 But we can consider the above definition as traditional, because today 'international politics' has been replaced by the broader concept 'international relations'
 iske antargat rajyon ke paraspar sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyogaatmak pahaluon ko bhi ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke antargat adhyayan kiya jaataa he
 Apart from this, apart from 'states', many other factors have now become the subject area of international politics
 atah iske antargat aaj vyakti, sanstha, sanghathan va kai anya gaiyr-rajya ikaiyaan bhi sammilit ho gai hai
 Its present base and subject area has taken a very wide form today
 in sabhi vishyon par charchaa se pehle alag-alag vidwaanon dwaara di gai nimna paribhaashaon kii samiksha karnaa ati anivaary ho jaataa he- The scope of these definitions is very limited, because basically 'states' have been considered as factors of international politics
 yah antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke swaroop tak hi simit he
 Mainly hannes j
 Margenthau, Harald Sprout, Bon Dyk, Thompson, etc
 are its main supporters, which is clear from their definitions- naveen paribhaashaon main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vyapak swaroop antarrashtriya sambandhon kii charchaa kii gai he
 In addition to the state, new factors of international politics such as international organizations, longitude groups, ngos, international institutions, some individuals etc
 have also been included
 iske atirikt isamen sangharsh ke saath-saath sahyog tathaa raajnneeti ke saath-saath pratyaksh yaa paroksh rup main ise prabhavit karne vaale arthath, saanskrithik, dharmik, saamaajik, vigyaan evam takniki aadi pahaluon kaa bhi ullekh kiya gaya he
 The following definitions of various authors reveal this meaning very clearly
 is prakaar antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop prarambh se vartmaan tak bahut vyapak ho jaataa he
 It has included the study of various world units and organizations along with nation states today
 parantu in sabhi parivartanon ke baad bhi in adhyayanon kaa kendra bindu aaj bhi raashtra rajya hi he
 Based on the above definitions, the following conclusions about the nature of international politics emerge
 atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop parivartansheel he
 Whenever the environment, factors and developments of international politics will change, changes in methods and approaches to study it are also inevitable
 iske atirikt, yah parivartan sthai na hokar nirantar he
 Along with this, it is very complex due to various factors, levels, dimensions, etc
 Therefore, a smooth, rational, comprehensive approach is required for its smooth study
 jaisaa uparyukt paribhaashaon evam swaroop se gyaat he ki antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra badhata hi ja rahaa he
 Today its subject area has become quite extensive, under which the following things are studied: atah antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa vishay kshetra aaj bahut vyapak va jatil hone ke saath-saath vikaas kii ore agrasar he
 Under this, the study of various traditional factors as well as non-traditional factors is also becoming important
 antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke vikaas kaa itihaas zyada pracheen nahin he, balki yah vishay beesvin shatabdi kii upaj he
 Clearly, its history begins with the establishment of the international Woodrow Wilson Chair in Welles University in 1919
 is peeth par pratham asin hone vaale prasiddh itihaaskaar professor aloard jimrn the tathaa baad main anya pramukh viddhan jinhone is peeth ko sushobhit kiya unamem se pramukh the - si

 At the same time similar arrangements were seen in other universities and institutes
 atah pichhali ek shatabdi ke is vishay ke itihaas par drushtipaat karen to is vishay main aaye utaar-chadhaav ke saath-saath iske ek swytt vishay main sthapit hone ke bare main jaankaree milti he
 Multidimensional changes in this subject have helped to enhance, coordinate and develop the content on the one hand, and on the other hand by rendering various theories, it has helped in understanding many complex problems and aspects
 kenneth thampsan ne san 1962 ke 'rivyuu of politics' main prakashit apane lekh main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke itihaas ko chaar bhaagon main baanta he, jiske aadhaar par is vishay kaa suspasht evam sunishchit adhyayan sambhav ho saktaa he
 These four stages of development can also include the fifth phase of the post-cold War era
 inkaa vistrut varnan nimna prakaar se he- Before the First World War, only scholars of history, law, political science, philosophy etc
 considered different aspects of international politics
 mukhya rup se itihaaskaar hi iskaa adhyayan rajanyik itihaas tathaa anya deshon ke saath sambandhon ke itihaas ke rup main karte the
 Under this, there was an account of the work done by diplomats and foreign ministers
 atah ise kootnithik itihaas kii sangya bhi di jaati he
 According to EH Kar, before World War I, the relation of war was understood only to the soldiers and its equivalent international politics was related to diplomats
 iske atirikt, prajatantric deshon main bhi paramparaagat rup se videsh niti ko dalgat raajnneeti se alag rakhaa jaataa tha tathaa chune hue ang bhi apane aapako videshi mantralay par ankush rakhane main asamarth mahasoos karte the
 Prior to 1919, there were several major reasons for apathy towards the subject - First, till this time it was believed that war and alliance among states were as natural as poverty and unemployment
 atah yuddh, videsh niti evam rajyon ke madhya paraspar sambandhon ko roak paanaa maanviya samarthy ke vash se baahar mana jaataa tha
 Second, before World War I, wars were not so fierce
 tritiy, sanchaar sadhano ke abhaav main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kuch gine chune rajyon tak hi simit thi
 Thus the biggest shortcoming of the study of international politics in this era was the development of general interests
 is kaal main keval rajanyik itihaas kaa varnanaatmak adhyayan maatra hi hua
 As a result, it helped to understand neither the current nor future international politics
 is yug kii maatra uplabdhi 1919 main wales vishvavidhyalay main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan ke peeth kii sthapana rahi
 In the period between the two world wars, two parallel currents developed
 jinamein se pratham ke antargat purv aitihaasikta ke prati prabhutv ko chhodkar samayik ghatnaon / samasyao ke adhyayan par adhik bal diya jane laga
 Along with this, an attempt has also been made to combine historical political studies with the current political contexts
 aitihaasik prabhaav ke kam hone ke baad bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan hetu ek samgr drushtikon kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 During this period, a lot of emphasis was placed on the study of the present, but the importance of the mutual relationship between the present and the past is still not recognized
 iske atirikt, na hi yudhottar raajnneetik samasyaon ko ateet kii tulaneey samasyaon ke saath rakhkar dekhne kaa prayaas hi kiya gaya
 Perhaps this is why even in this era two fundamental deficiencies were clearly revealed
 pratham, pehle charan kii hi bhaanti is kaal main bhi antarrashtriya raajnneeti main saarvbhaumik siddhanth kaa vikaas nahin ho sakaa
 Second, even today the study of international politics could not become more explicit and rational
 is prakaar is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke adhyayan main bal dene kii sthiti main badlaav ke atirikt bahut zyada parivartan dekhne ko nahin mila tathaa na hi is vishay ke spasht rup se swatantra anushaasan banane kii pushti hui
 The third phase of the development of international politics was also a period between two world wars parallel to the second phase
 ise sudhaarwad kaa yug isliye kaha jaataa he ki isamen rajyon dwaara raashtra sangh kii sthapana ke kadhyam se antarrashtriya raajnneeti main sudhaar kii kalpana kii gai
 In this era, there was mainly institutional development
 is kaal ke vidwaanon, rajanyikon, rajanetaaon va chintakon kaa maananaa tha ki yadi antarrashtriya sansthaaon kaa vikaas ho jaataa he to vishwa samudaay ke sammukh upasthit yuddh va shanti kii samasyaon kaa samaadhaan sambhav ho sakegaa
 For this purpose some legal and ethical approaches were structured which had the following main grounds
 inhen aadarshik evam naitik mulyon par bal dete hue antarrashtriya sanghathan kii pariklpana kii gai
 After its establishment, it was believed that the struggle to make peace between the states in international relations is over
 nai vyavastha ke antargat shakti santulan kaa koi sthaan nahin hoga
 Now the states will settle their disputes through the Union
 atah is yug main na keval yuddh va shaanti kii samasyaon kaa vivechan kiya, apitu iske doorgaami sudhaaron ke bare main bhi sochaa gaya
 Hence, the main points of the study were also to change the nature of international politics through legal problems and development of organizations
 antatah is kaal main bhavatmak, kalpanasheel va naitik sudhaarwad par adhik bal diya gaya he
 But there was always a question mark on the significance of these approaches between the World Wars
 raashtra sangh kii pratham ek dashak kii gatividhiyon se jahaan aashaa kii kiran dikhaai di, vahiin duusare dashak kii yarthathwaadee sthiti ne is dharna ko bilkul samaapt kar diya
 Non-cooperation and factionalism among the big powers gave rise to a power struggle system instead of establishing peace
 japan ne manchuriya par hamale karke jahaan shanti ko bhang kar diya vahiin italy, germany va rus ne bhi vivaadaaspad sthitiyon main na keval raashtra sangh kii sadsyta hi chodi, balki dwitiya vishwayuddh ke prarambh hone kii prakriya ko or teevr bana diya
 In this way, the world system could not run with peace, morality and law, then the realist approach was strengthened as an alternative approach due to writers like EH Kar, Shumbha, Quincy Right
 is charan main antarrashtriya raajnneeti main moolbhoot parivartanon se na keval isaki vishaywastu vyapak hui balki isamen bahut jatiltaayen bhi paidaa ho gai
 Changes in the nature of politics and the rise of new states during the Cold War era changed the entire international environment
 parinamswaroop naye upagamon, ayaamon, sansthaaon va pravritiyon kaa sarjan hua jinke madhyam se antarrashtriya sambandhon kaa adhyayan sunishchit ho gaya
 The failures of the ideal, institutional, ethical, legal and reformist streams of the earlier stages led to the development of new approaches
 yah nayaa upagam tha-yatharthwaad
 Although EH Karr, Schwarzenberger, Quincy Right, Shubhan etc
 developed this approach, but Hanes J
 Margenthau presented it as a general principle
 is siddhanth ke anusaar rajya hameshaa apane hiton kii purti hetu sangharshrat rahete hai
 Therefore, to understand international politics, it is very important to understand the various aspects of this power struggle
 yathartwaadee drushtikon ke saath antarrashtriya sansthaaon ke sunishchit va suspasht vikaas ke rup main antarrashtriya sanghathan kii bhi utpatti hui
 Now the form of this organization emerged as an important political organization rather than an idealistic and reformist
 iske antargat maanavjaati ko yuddh kii vibheeshikaa se bachaane ke saath-saath rajyon ke madhya sangharsh ke koun-koun se kaaran hai? vishvashanti hetu khatre ke koun-koun se kaarak hai? shanti kii sthapana kaise ho sakati he? shastron kii hode ko kaise roka ja saktaa he? aadi kai prakaar ke prashnon kaa samaadhaan dhundne ke prayaas bhi kiye gaye
 Along with the above two trends, the origin of behaviorism was also an important achievement of this era
 vyavahaaravaadi drushtikon ke madhyam se ”vyavastha siddhanth“ kii utpatti kar antarrashtriya raajnneeti ko samajhane kaa prayaas kiya gaya
 Under this approach, it is considered necessary to study three major factors for the study of states
 ye kaarak the- The main force of the above trends has been to promote the ideology of international politics
 atah is yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti ke saarvbhaumik siddhanton kaa pratipaadan karnaa ati mahatvapurn kaary rahaa he
 As a result of this process of theory formation, many partial theories like - realism, theory of balance, communication theory, sports theory, bargaining theory, peace research approach, system theory, world order model etc
 were created
 in siddhanton ke pratipaadan ke baavjood is yug main kisi ek saarvbhaumik va saamaanya siddhanth kaa abhaav abhi bhi bana rahaa
 In the 1990s, Jayant Bandhopadhyay, in his book - General Theory of International Relations - has tried to overcome the shortcomings of Martin Kaplan's administrative theory, but he is still in a period of debate
 atah saiddhantikaran ke mukhya daur ke baavjood shityudh kaaleen yug apni vaicharik sankeernata va algaav ke kaaran kisi ek saamaanya siddhanth ke pratipaadan se vanchit rahaa
 In the post-cold War era, all nations started joining together under one economic system
 isiilie ab vaishvikaran, udaarikaran, mukt bazaar vyavastha aadi kaa daur prarambh ho gaya
 In this context, not only the importance of economic issues increased, but the importance of international politics also increased
 aaj rashtriyata evam antarrashtriyata kaa vibhed samaapt ho gaya iske atirikt, ab antarrashtriya raajnneeti kii vishay suchi main kaaphi naveen vishyon kaa samavesh ho gaya jo rashtriya na rahakar ab maanavjaati kii samasyaon ke rup main ubhar kar aaye
 Among the major problems of the current world, terrorism, environment, depletion of ozone layer, trafficking of drugs and drugs, human rights abuses etc
, major issues have emerged which have become mandatory to solve at international level rather than at national level or regional level
 
 saiddhanthik str par bhi 1945 se 1991 tak ke saarvbhaumik siddhanth kii sthapana ke prayaas ko dhakka laga
 Priorities in this context of international politics have now changed
 uttar-aadhuniktawaad main ab saarvbhaumik siddhanton kii sarthakata par prashn chihn lag rahe hai
 The influence of historical context and ancient environment is also being denied
 ab swatantra mudde adhik mahatvapurn ho gaye hai
 Great principles have become secondary
 nae sandarbh main aanshik shodh adhik mahatvapurn ban gai he
 For example, with more emphasis on the topics of feminism, human rights, environment etc
, thinking has also started
 atah shityudhottar yug main antarrashtriya raajnneeti kaa swaroop, vishay suchi evam vishay kshetra purna rup se parivartit ho gaye hai
 Now too much emphasis is not being laid on the general theoretical establishment

 The entire system of the famous monthly magazine Saraswati, Sriganesh and its editorial was made by this gathering in the beginning
 akhil bhartiya hindi sahitya sanmelan kaa sanghathan or sarvapratham uskaa aayojan bhi sabha ne hi kiya tha
 Similarly, this gathering continued to preserve, nurture and promote an era of internationally acclaimed archeology and paintings called Bharat Kala Bhavan located in the Hindu University
 antat jab uskaa swatantra vikaas yahan avaruddh hone laga or vishvavidhyalay main uski bhavishyonnati kii sambhaavna hui to sabha ne use vishvavidhyalay ko hastantarit kar diya
 In the year 2000, the gathering commemorated the completion of the twentieth century of Maharaja Vikramaditya and 60 years of his golden jubilees and life
 In 2010, he organized his Diamond Jubilee in a big way

 Appropriate state support was also available to the House, as a result, the House is carrying out these tasks in a proper manner
 44 °C, 317 K, 111 °F 260 ° C, 533 K, 500 ° f cinamide ek carbonic yogic he jiskaa anusutra CN2H2 he
 Cyanamide is a colorless, crystalline, precipitated solid
 iskaa galnaank 43 degree - 44 degree celsius he
 Its solubility is higher in water, alcohol or ether but only in carbon dioxide, benzene or chloroform
 sandra amla ke saath yah lavan banaata he jinka jal-apghaton hota he
 Cyanamide is readily obtained by the reaction of ammonia and cyanogen chloride or bromide: maracurik oxide dwaara thayouria kaa agandhikaran karke bhi isko taiyaar karte hai
 To prepare cyanamide commercially, the calcium cyanamides are sieved by thoroughly stirring with water and neutralized by sulfuric acid; Then the filtrate evaporates in a vacuum
 kshareey yogicon kii upasthiti main cinamide kaa jaleey vilyan bahulkikaran dwaara ek dvitay dycinamide, NC, C,NH, NH2) banaata he
 Heating dicyanamide or cyanamide to 120 ° –125 ° c in an inert atmosphere gives triad, melamine, H2NC = N, c = N, c = N; It gets more by heating with ammonia and it is also more pure
 hydrogen sulphide ke saath thayouria tathaa ammonia ke saath guanidin banaata he
 The hydrogen atom of cyanamide is displaced from the metal
 jaleey athwa alcoholeey vilyan main kshareey dhaatu hydroxide yaa calcium hydroxide cinamide ke hydrogen kaa ek parmaanu visthapit karata he: The second atom of hydrogen is not directly displaced from the alkaline metal or calcium: disodium cyanamide is found as a secondary compound in the preparation of sodium cyanide by the Casner method
 calcium carbide ko nitrogen ke saath 1000 degree celsius ke lagbhag garam karne se caslium cinamide miltaa he; duusari dhaatuon ke carbide bhi unche taap par nitrogen ke saath garam karne se tatsambandhi cinamide banaate hai
 By heating the cyanide of some metals, the corresponding cyanamides and carbon are decomposed
 calcium, magnisium, sisa tathaa lohe ke cynide main is prakaar kaa vighatan keval garam karne se hota he
 But cyanide of zinc, cadmium, cobalt, nickel and lithium also requires catalysts in addition to heat
 calcium cinamide adhik maatra main calcium carbide or nitrogen kii abhikriya se taiyaar kii jaati he
 Around 1895, Adolf Frank and Nicodom Caro discovered that commercial calcium carbide was 800 cm
 Reacts more readily with nitrogen at higher temperatures than: calcium carbide ko abhisht taap par garam karke uske upar nitrogen ko pravaahit karte hai; nitrogen calcium carbide ke saath abhikriya karata he; is abhikriya main adhik ooshmaa utpann hoti he jisase calcium carbide kaa taap or adhik ho jaataa he
 Therefore, nitrogen continues to function until all the calcium carbide is exhausted
 prayogon dwaara gyaat kiya gaya ki taap badhaane se is kriya kii gati badhati he
 But at temperatures above 1200 ° C, calcium cyanide dissolves
 at: is kriya ke liye upyukt taap 1100 degree -1130 degree celsius he
 Calcium chloride or a mixture of calcium chloride and calcium fluoride are catalysts for this action; Nitrogen must be at least 99
7% pure and calcium carbide powder must be made in an inert atmosphere
 calcium cinamide ko vyavsaayik maatra main taiyaar karne kii vidhi ko asantat vidhi kehete hai
 Nowadays, 4 to 10 tons of slotted kilns are used in this method
 bhatthiyaan dhalave lohe kii hoti hai, inkaa bhitari bhaag agalneey mitti tathaa taapasah iton se agni ke prabhaav se mukt rahata he
 a large paper cylinder is kept in the furnace cavity for calcium carbide
 florespar kii alp maatra calcium carbide ke saath milaai rahati he
 Florespar acts as a catalyst and controls the reaction
 bhatti kaa munh ek taap avarohak dhakkan se dhak diya jaataa he
 One 'electrode' of heating power remains through the lid to the calcium carbide through the middle hole and the other to the bottom of the furnace
 bhatthi ke tal or parshv ke chhidron dwaara nitrogen pravaahit karte hai
 Chemical reactions begin by heating the inner part of the furnace to 1000 ° –1100 ° C, until all of it is reacted with calcium carbide nitrogen
 yah kriya swayan hoti rahati he
 These take about 24 to 40 hours
 kriya samaapt ho jane par calcium cinamide ko bhatthi se nikaalkar niskriy vayumandal main ikattha karte hai
 The second method of preparing calcium cyanamide in commercial quantities is called Santat method
 is vidhi main calcium carbide ko 10 pratishat calcium chloride ke saath milakar lohe ke chhidrayukt bade-bade bartanon main bharte hai, phir is bartanon ko ek nitrogen gas se bhari hui surang main ghumaate hai
 a portion of the tunnel is heated from the outside; This is where the action takes place
 isse agle bhaag main niyantrit vayushitak kaa prabandh rahata he, yah kriya ke liye upyukt taap banaae rakhata he
 The last part of the tunnel acts as a cold chamber
 upar kii vidhiyon se praapt kiya hua calcium cinamide gaharaa bhure rang kaa churna hota he
 Its color is due to carbon
 chini mitti kii nalee main 750 degree se 850 degree celsius par 2 ghante tak tapt kiye hue calcium carbonate ke upar hydrocynide vaashp pravaahit karne se 99% shuddh calcium cinamide miltaa he; tapt calcium carbonate ke upar aaytan ke anusaar 10 bhaag ammonia or 2 bhaag carbon monoksaide pravaahit karne se 92% shuddh calcium cinamide miltaa he
 Calcium cyanamide decomposes into ammonia and calcium carbonate at 110 ° -115 ° c and 6 atmospheres pressure- saadhaarant: calcium cinamide kaa upyog uttam urvarak ke rup main hota he
 Their nitrogen makes ammonia in the soil and as such it acts as a barrier to the depository
 isse viley calcium miltaa he jo paudhon ke liye pushtikaarak hota he tathaa mitti kii amlata ko thik rakhata he

 aap khaali baithna to jaanate hi nahin
 "when he got out of jail in 1942, he had to show that despair in the Indian society was there, all were frustrated
 at: unhone 'congress pratinidhi asembli' naamak sanstha kii sthapana kar pun: nai chetana kaa sanchaar kiya or jab prantiya cametiyaan bani tab 'pratinidhi asembli' bhang kar di gai

 Member of Lok Sabha in 1952 and Rajya Sabha member in 1957
 is prakaar ve aaajeevan bhartiya raajnneeti main sakriy rahakar use disha pradaan karte rahe
 Rajarshi Purushottam Das Tandon was the leader of the leading line of the Indian National Movement
 kuch vichaarkon ke anusaar swatantraaa praapt karnaa unka pehla saadhy tha
 He considered Hindi as a means - "if Hindi comes in the way of Indian freedom, i myself will strangle him
" ve hindi ko desh kii aazaadee ke pehle aazaadee praapt karne kaa saadhan maanate rahe or aazaadee milane ke baad aazaadee ko banaaye rakhane kaa
 "it should not be forgotten here that Tandon's entry into politics was due to his love for Hindi
 tandon ji ne gwalior ke victoria college main hindi ke lekturer ke rup main kaary kiya us samay atal bihari vaajapei victoria college ke chaatr hua karte the
 On 17 February 1951, on the occasion of the 17th anniversary celebration of Muzaffarnagar 'suhrid Sangh', Tandon ji said- "I entered into an organization like Congress with the aim of strengthening the Hindi side, because Hindi's influence on my heart is the most
 It was more and i made him the greatest vow of my life
 xxrep 6 
 hindi sahitya ke prati mere prem ne uske swaarthon kii raksha or uske vikaas ke path ko spasht karne ke liye mujhe raajnneeti main sammilit hone ko baadhya kiya
 "therefore, it can be said that Tandon Ji had both the independence and Hindi
 rajarshi main balykaal se hi hindi ke prati anuraag tha
 Balakrishna Bhatt and Madan Mohan Malaviya ji gave maturity to this love
 10 oktover 1910 ko kaashi main hindi sahitya sammelan kaa pratham adhiveshan mahaamanaa malviya ji kii adhyakshata main hua or tandon ji sammelan ke mantri niyukt hue
 Subsequently, he served Hindi extensively through Hindi Sahitya Sammelan
 tandon ji ne hindi ke prachaar prasar ke liye hindi viapeeth prayag kii sthapana kii
 The purpose of setting up this Chair was to spread Hindi education and end the domination of English
 sammelan hindi kii anek parikshaayen sampann karata tha
 Due to these examinations, Hindi was also spread in the south
 sammelan ke is kaary kaa prabhaav mahavidhyalayon evam vishvavidhyalayon main bhi padaa, anek mahavidhyalayon evam vishvavidhyalayon main hindi ke paathyakram ko manyata mili
 He knew that the cooperation of non-hindi speakers is necessary for the spread of Hindi throughout India
 shaayad unki isi soch kaa parinaam tha sammelan main gandhi kaa liya janaa
 Later, there was a difference of opinion between Tandonji and Mahatma Gandhi on the question of 'hindustani'
 tandon ji aparaajey yoddha the
 He could take on anyone for truth and justice
 apane siddhanton par chattan kii tarah adig evam sthir rahete the
 As a result Gandhiji had to separate himself from the conference, Tandon ji continued on his path
 san 1949 main jab samvidhan sabha main rajbhasha sambandhi prashn uthaaya gaya to us samay ek vicitra sthiti thi
 Mahatma Gandhi was a supporter of Hindustani, Pandit Nehru and Dr
 Rajendra Prasad and many other leaders were also in favor of Hindustani, but Tandon ji did not lose, not bow down
 parinamat: vijay bhi unki hui
 After the heated debate on 11, 12, 13, 14 December 1949, the Congress voted on Hindi and Hindustani, Hindi got 62 and Hindustani got 32 votes
 antat: hindi rashtrabhasha or devanagari rajalipi ghoshit hui
 In order to get Hindi the national language and 'vande Mataram' the national anthem, Tandon ji launched another campaign with his colleagues
 unhone karodon logon ke hastakshar or samarthan patr bhi ekatra kiye the
 It is also necessary to mention here that Tandon ji tried his best to get the civilian marks recognized in the constitution, for this he left the institution which he served for almost five decades
 samvidhan-sabha main rajarshi ne angreji ankon kaa virodh kiya par nehru ji kii hidaayat ke kaaran congressi sadsy shri kanhaiyalaal maniklal munshi, shri gopal swami ingar ke formule ke paksh main rahe
 Tandon ji's protest motion fell and the civil issue could not be recognized in the constitution
 hindi ko rashtrabhasha or 'vandemaataram' ko raashtragit sweekrut karaane ke liye tandon ji ne apane sahyogiyon ke saath ek or abhiyaan chalaaya tha
 He had also collected signatures and letters of support from crores of people
 rajarshi ke vyaktitv evam krititv kaa akalan karte samay praaia: unke sahityakar rup ko andekha kar diya jaataa he
 He was the creator of a high court
 unki rachanaaon main tatkaaleen itihaas kii khoj kii ja sakati he
 As a litterateur, Tandon appears as an essayist, poet and journalist
 unke niabandh hindi bhashaa or sahitya, dharm or samskruti tathaa anya vividh kshetron se sambandhit hai
 Among the poetic compositions, 'bandar Sabha Epic', 'cottage Flower' and 'freedom' have their historical significance
 in kavitaaon main rashtriyata or deshbhakti kii pramukhataa he
 In his works, to find closely the poetics will have to be pierced, but the expression with which the Tandan ji has expressed the age-old reality is certainly praiseworthy - 'bandar sabha mahakavy` main aalha style main angrejon kii nitiyon kaa bhandaphod kiya he
 Enjoy one or two of the jokes he has taken against the British - patrakarita ke kshetra main tandon ji angreji ke bhi udbhat vidwaan the
 Shri Tribhuvan Narayan Singh ji has mentioned that when he was elected the President of the Congress in 1950, he wrote his address in Hindi and i did the English translation
 shri sampoornanand ji ne bhi us angreji anuwaad ko dekha, lekin jab tandon ji ne us anuwaad ko padhaa, to usamen kai pannon ko phir se likhaa
 Then i realized that while he was a learned scholar of Hindi, he also had great authority over English literature
 purushottams tandon ke bahu aiami or pratibhashali vyaktitv ko dekhakar unhen 'rajarshi` kii oopaadhi se vibhooshit kiya gaya
 On the evening of 15 April 1948, Mahanta Devaraha Baba honored you with the title of 'rajarshi' with a Vedic chant on the Saryu coast
 kuch logon ne ise anuchit tehraaya, par jyotirmath ke shri shankaracharya maharaj ne ise shastrasammat mana or kaashi kii pandit sabha ne 1948 ke akhil bhartiya saanskrithik sammelan ke oopaadhi vitaran samaaroh main isaki pushti kii
 Since then, this title has been embellished with its name inextricably linked
 bhartiya samskruti ke param himachati or pakshdhar hone par bhi rajarshi roodhiyon or andhvishwaason ke kattar virdohi the
 He also expressed his blunt thoughts on the evils and malpractices prevalent in Indian society
 unamem ek adbhut aatmbal tha, jisase ve kathin se kathin kaary ko aasaani se sampann kar lete the
 In relation to child marriage and widow marriage, he believed that "the promotion of widow marriage is contrary to our civilizational, our literature and the pativrat religion, the mainstay of our society organization"
 He clarified that the demand for widow-marriage is increasing because In our society, the system against child marriage has run and the question of child widows is the main problem of Indian society
 at: "bal-vivaah kii pratha ko rokna hi vidhwaa vivaah karne kii apeksha adhik mahatv kaa kartavya siddh hota he
 " unke vyaktitv ke is pahalu ke ek-do udhaaharan paryaapt honge- praaia: log samajhate hai ki pakaa hua bhojan supachya hota he, par rajarshi ne ise ek roodhi mana or unhone varshon tak aag se pake hue bhojan ko nahin grahan kiya
 Once left the Chinese food
 ek ore unhen gaay ke doodh se parhez tha to duusari ore chamade ke juute se
 Thus he was the holder of a wonderful personality
 bharatvarsh main swatantraaa ke purv se hi sampradayikta kii samasya apane vikat rup main vidyaman rahi
 Some leaders have also accused Tandonji of being communal
 yah sach he ki rajarshi apni samskruti ke param bhakt or poshak the
 He also did not feel hesitant to say that keeping two cultures alive in India would be a betrayal of the country, but this did not mean that Tandonji was communal, anti-muslim
 is sambandh main kulkusum ke vichaar kitne sarthak hai- Tandonji himself has also written- vastav main tandon ji kaa vyaktitv maanavvaadi tha
 The child who supported him at his home was a Muslim, but how ironic that people say that Tandonji was communal
 rajarshi tandon ji ke vyaktitv ke anya anek pahalu or bhi hai; jaise ve garibon, peediton ke sahaayak the, sahi arthon main deenabandhu the, karunaa kii murti the or babu ji kitne naitik aacharan ke vyakti the iskaa anumaan is udhaaharan se lagaaya ja saktaa he- "the year 1950 was Mahakumbh
 bahua ne ganga snaan ke liye gaadi se jane kii baat kahi
 Babu Ji replied that the car belonged to the 'speaker'
 tum mere saath to ja sakati ho, kintu akele nahin
 " uparyukt sankshipt vivechan ke baad yah kaha ja saktaa he ki rajarshi kaa vyaktitv bahuaiami or rajarshi ke anuroop tha
 He was rich in versatility
 ve hindi ke anany premi hi nahin, balki hindi ke paryaay the
 He is mentioned in the history of Hindi literature as an able poet and essay writer
 bhartiya swatantraaa sangram ke amar sannaniyon main unki gananaa agrim pankti ke senaniyon main kii jaati he or unka naam bhartiya swantantraa sangram ke itihaas main swarna aksharon se ankit he
 He was the holder of the steel personality, despite being an affectionate, generous and compassionate idol
 himalay kii tarah achal or atal
 My heartfelt condolences to this supreme Hindi Savi, national devotee and worshiper of Indian culture
