 jab chin ne china par qabza karnaa shuru kiya tab china main jhou rajvansh kaa keval naam maatr kaa niyantran tha or jhagadate rajyon kaa kaal chal rahaa tha
 The Chin dynasty came from one of the same quarreling states, the Chin kingdom
 sabase pehle chin ne kamazor jhou vansh ko samaapt kiya or phir baaqi ke chah rajyon ko nasht kar ke china kaa ekikaran kiya

 is iraade ke baavjood, in donon main aapas main ladaai ho gai, jis se ve donon or nayaa samraat, teenon hi apni jaanon se haath dho baithe
 Seeing these weaknesses in the dynasty, rebellions broke out and a Chu state leader seized power

 Mr

 1
 
 jyon ganga jal paan ten, pavat pad nirvaan
 Tयोंy Sindhur - The main thing is, the foolish Buddha
 
 2
 
 Koko born to a farm friend, Tako Barnon Keenh
 sukh sampati maaya mili, so upades ju dinh
 
 
 3
 
 Bipra Sudama is settled, always abode
 bhiksha kari bhojan karain, hiye japain hari naam
 
 4
 
 taaki dharani pativrata, gahe veda kii reeti
 Sulaj, Susil, Subuddhi Ati, husband in love
 
 5
 
 Somewhere Sudama one day, Krissan our friend
 karat rahati upades tiy, aiso param vicitra
 
 6
 
 maharaj jinke hitu, hai hari yadukul chand
 Te darid santa te, rahi na nirvand
 
 7
 
 Kahyo sudama bam sunu, vratha and all enjoyment
 satya bhajan bhagwaan ko, dharm sahit jap-jog
 
 8
 
 lochan-camel dukhamochan tilak bhaal, Sravani Kundal is the crowned crown
 odhe pit basan gare main baijayanti maal; Sankha Chakra mace and Padma are the right hand
 
 With the Kahat Narottam Sandipani Guru, tumahi kahat ham padhe ek saath hai
 Hari Darid went to Harange to Dwarka, dwarika ke nath ve anaathan ke nath hai
 
 9
 
 sichhak hon cigare jag ko, Ti! Tako said, now it is a wish je tap kai paralok sudhaarat, i do not wish for a straw 
 Pankaj, Hari's post for me baar hajaar lai dekhu parichha
 Auran wants money, Bawri banken ke dhan keval bhichha
 
 10
 
 dani bade tihun locan main, Always take the name of Jag Jeevat dinan kii sudhi let bhalee vidhi, Prove to drink, do not die
 dinadayal ke dwaar na jaat so, And the door is spoken by shri jadunath se jake hitu so, Why do you want to fall in love? 
 11
 
 Kshatrin's Junk Judda, saji baji chadhe gajrajan hi
 Bais Baaniz and Krisi pun
 sood ko seven saajan hi
 This is because of the vision sukh sampati ko kuch kaaj nahin
 How can you read meditation? can maangat banbhanai laaj nahin
 
 12
 
 kodon savaan jurato bhari pet, Do not want Dadhi-milk sweets
 sit vithit bhayo siciatahi; You are not a pathetic person
 jau janati na hitu hari son, Dwarika theli patouti to you
 yaa gharaten na gayo kabahoon, piy ! Tuto tawa aru footi kathouti 
 13
 
 Everything is being done aathhu jam yahai jiy thaanee
 The people who pay are paid laihon ladaay yahai jiy jaani
 Pahoun kahan te attari ata, jinke vidhi dinhi he tuuti si chhaani
 Lilaar, which is a penny writing to kahu pai meti na jaat ajaani
 
 14
 
 puuran paj kari prahlada kii, Pillar Dam Banyo father Jihi Bere
 draupadi dhyaan dharyo jabahin That is when the entire line was spread
 
 Ghiyand giyand gaya dar, yaahi so he nihchay jiy mere
 Such poor thousand hare kripanidhi lochan-kor ke here
 
 15
 
 chakkavai chauki rahe chaki se, i have to forget about Bhoop here
 dev gandharv ou kinnar jachh se, Dusk flames remain thick wherever it is
 
 Now these are not the courts, tohi kaha kahike samajhaaun Stop the head of Lokan, tahan hon dukhiya kimi pairun paaun
 
 16
 
 bhul se bhoop anek khare rahau, Fiercely timber, heavy and heavy dev gandharv ou kinnar jachh se, Melo Tinkau Officer
 
 You know the difference manau yahai sikhi aaju hamaari
 Dwarkanath went by sab te pahile sudhi laihain tihaari
 
 17
 
 deen dayaal ko asoi dwaar he, Dinan ki sudhi leat sadai draupadi tain gaj tain prahlaad tain, Jani Pari Na was suspended
 
 Yaahi te bhavati mo man dinata- jau nibahai nibahai jas ai
 Barley Brajraj is not a lover, kehi kaaj sureshu kii thakuraai
 
 18
 
 phate pat tuuti chhaani khaay bhik maangi maangi, Without the sacrificial fire, the god Dev Tritai
 ve hai dinabandhu dukhi dekhi kai dayaalu hraihai, There is some tortoise and a hundred thousand lives
 
 Dwarika returned to sleep! Here you are, kaahe kau lajaat bhai kaunsi vichitrai
 Barley pae sub birth or poor only satayau tope, koun kaaj ai he kripanidhi kii mitrai
 
 19
 
 tain to kahi niki sunu baat hit hi kii
 This is the custom of friendship of friendship always
 chitt ke milite chitt dhaaie parasapar, Friend's barley, please join me
 
 He is Maharaj Zori Shatat Samaj Bhupa, tahaan yahi rup jaai kaha sakuchie
 On the day of sorrow and happiness, you will now be cut off, forget it bipat pare pai dwaar mitra ke na jaaie
 
 20
 
 vipran ke bhagat jagat ke vidit bandhu Let me remember all of these people are such great people
 padhe ek chatsaar kahi tum kay baar, Lochan is immense, you are not recognized
 
 One Deenbandhu, Kripasindhu Keri Gurubandhu, tum sam ko deen jaahi nizjiy janihain
 Quadruple name dekhat sahasraguni priti prabhu manihain
 
 21
 
 priti main chook nahin unke hari, Mo mili hai uti kanthi kaayi dwaar gaye kachu dai hai pai dai hai, They are Dwarka Dwarka Joo is worth all
 
 Jai Bidhi went past, ab to pahuncho birdhaapan aay kai
 Remaining life, day by day, hohun hari sein kanavado jaae kai
 
 22
 
 hujai kanavado baar hajaar laun, Get barley Hitu Din kindness
 tinihu lok ke thakur je, Do not go to court
 
 Live where i drink bhuli na or prasang chalie
 And where did you drink, dwarika nath ke dwaare sidhaaie
 
 23
 
 dwarika jahu ju dwarika jahu ju, Ehthu jam, it is yours jau na kahau kariye tau bado dukh, Where are you, your speed 
 The door of the Lord standing in the doorway, bhupati jaan na pavat nere
 Panchu supari tau dekhu bachari kai, bhent ko chaari na chaanvar mere
 
 24
 
 yahi suni kai tab brahmani, gai parosine paas
 Hullas with paw ser chor lei
 
 25
 
 Siddhi Kari Ganapathi Sumiri, Bandhi Dupatiya Khunt
 maangat khaat chale tahaan, marag bali-boont
 
 26
 
 teen diwas chali wipro ke, dukhi uthe jab pany
 Let me sleep a while, lay the grass and love
 
 27
 
 Antarjami Aapu Hari, Pir of the world
 so lai thandho kiyo, nadi gomti tir
 
 28
 
 praat gomti daras ten, ati prasann bho chitt
 Make your way as easy as possible, for that purpose

 Bhal Tilak Ghasi Caiyo, Gahi Sumirini Hath
 dekhi divya draravati, bhayo anaath sanath
 
 30
 
 dithi chakachaundhi gai dekhat suburnmai, Ek te achhe is the eyebrow of a Dwarka
 puche binu kou kahoon kahu son baat karai, All the sadhas sitting with the deity are silent
 
 Dekhat Sudama Dhay Paurajan Gaye Pyaan krupa kari kaho wipro kahaan kinhon gaun he Pir on the stool of endurance impatient, bataao balbir ke mahal yahan koun he
 
 31
 
 deen jaani kahu purus, kar gahi linho aay
 Deen dwar chod kio, deen dayal ki jaye
 
 32
 
 Dwarpala Dwij Jani Kai, Kaini Dand Pranam

 33

 Kul Pandey Vrajraj Suni, Sakal Jani hai Gath
 
 34
 
 Dwar paal chali tahn gaya, where krisna yaduraya
 haath jori thaadho bhayo, bolio sis navy
 
 35
 
 sis paga na jhangaa tan main, Lord ! Life is settled for life dhoti fatty-si laty-lupati aru, No content of feasting
 
 The door is a dwarf, weak one, rahyo chaki so basudha abhirama
 Dhamat ask din dayal, bataavat apano naam sudama
 
 36
 
 bolio dwarpal ek 'sudama naam pandey' suni, Do you know the speed of such a person? dwarika ke nath haath jori dhai gahe pany, Points filled with tears to hurt nain dou jal bhari puchhat kusal hari, Mohi Pachichanai in Vipra Bolio disaster? jaisi tum kari taisi kari ko dayaa ke sindhu, Such a love, Deenbandhu! To whom have i met? 
 37
 
 The water bodies are full, prabhu doori te dekhat hi dukh bhetyo
 Think of fear, Sunnayak, kalpadrum ke hiy maaz khaseto1
 
 camp kuber hiye sarsyo, Parse pag jat Sumeru Sametyo
 rank te rau bhayo tabaheen, Whenever Bhari Ankam Ramapati Bhetyo

 Well done Law Viprason, Kar Ghi Tribhuvanarai
 ant:poor ko lai gaye, jahaan na duujo jaay

 Water was brought to the step of the dish

 Rajaramani Sorah Sahas, Sub Sevik Samit 2

 Such unhappy parents, pag kantak jaal lage puni joe
 Hi Maha Dukh Payo Sakha, aae itai na kitai din khoe
 
 dekhi sudama kii deen dasa, Karuna Kari Kai karuna-nidhi cried
 pani paraat ko haath chhuyu nahin, Washes of water with nanon
 
 43
 
 Dhye paan pat-pithon, wipe is Jaduraya

 See Raja Rajput property potential, cannot be achieved

 The way of intermarriage Aapu Hari, Jani Bhagat
 suhd sudama wipro son, prakat janaai priti
 
 46
 
 kachu bhabhi hamako diyo, so tum kaahe na det
 In the champagne pottery armpit, say it for the sake
 
 47
 
 Go ahead Gurumatu di te lae tum chaabi hamen nahin deene
 Sayam Kahyo Musukay Sudama Son, chori kii bani main hau ju pravine
 
 potari kaankh main chaanpi rahe tum, Kholeat nahin reforms also
 pachhili bani ajon na taji tum, Tainai sister-in-law 48

 Jeeran pat phat chhukhi pakhio, Bithri gaye tehi thor

 chabat chabau karan lage, chaturanan tripurari
 
 50
 
 kampi uthi kamala man sochat, Monson said, do you mind Hari? riddhi canpi sab siddhi canpi; Navnidhi kampi bamna to dhome? soch bhayo suranayak ke, When Leo leaps for the second time
 meru dasyo bakse nij mehin, Kubera Chabawat Chaur Chonko
 
 51
 
 Hul Hiera has all ears, bheintt sudama syam chaabi na aghaat hi
 Say hello to the best man Riddhi Siddhin, thadhi thar harai or soche kamala tahin

 Bhano Bharo dish sweet, log kahain nidhi hai sukhma ke
 Dawn twilight daakhan chaakhat sindhu chama ke
 
 babhan ek kou dukhiya ser- Pawan Chower of Lao Sama
 priti kii reeti kaha kahie, This is the chabat of Kant Rama
 
 53
 
 Muthi third Bharat only, Rukmini Pakari arm

 Why drink poison balm in juice, ab or na khan diyo ek funka
 Viprihan Lok Tertiary Country, kari tum kyon apane man sanka
 
 bhamini mohi jenvai bhalee vidhi, Who rancas in the world lok kahai hari mitra dukhi, This caste is not sorrowful for all of us
 
 55 a
 
 Bhargava who subjugated all, day vipran ko ati hi sukh maano
 Wipron decorating you, nishi tadin ko bisaro khisiano
 
 sindhu hataay karo tum thor, Know well the method of biogenesis
 so tum det dwijai sab lok, Who are you now? 
 55 B
 
 Bhamini Dev Dwijai Sub Lok, tajon hat mor yahai man bhai
 The happiness of Lok Chaturdas laagat wipro bina dukhadai
 
 jaay rahon unke ghar main, o Karun Dwij Dumpati's ministry to man maahi ruchai na ruchai, So i am interested in that
 
 55 c
 
 Why is Bamini not yet nij byaah samay dwij kii hituai
 Forgot to do Dwij, jehi ke kar son patiyaa pathvai
 
 wipro sahay bhayo tehi ausar, Sujdhi to the Dwij group
 yogya nahin ardhangini he, Iti Nithurai for Dwij
 
 55 D
 
 He came as a servant in the time of Kautuk

 For seven days, this method should be respected day by day
 chitt chalys ghar chalan ko, taku sunhu hawaal

 daahine veda padhai chaturanan, The community is meditating
 
 Dori Karu Zori Susavek, devan saath surese kharyo he
 
 
 Meanwhile, money for many, payan aay kuber paryo he
 Look at your dreams, bapuro vah banbhan chaunki paryo he

 62
 
 ghar ghar kar odat phire, tanak dahi ke kaaj
 Said those who fear now, Hari to the royal society

 Yes, i am not there, but there is no plateau
 ab kahi hon samujhaay kai, bahu dhan dharu sakeli
 
 64

 Hari Darsan is far away from sorrow, fear is lost gautam rishi ko naaun lai, kinho nagar praves
 
 70
 
 vaisoi raaj samaaj bano gaj, The eagle is dense
 kaitau paryo kahun marag bhuli, Now i come to Dwarka 
 Mind stretches to mind, sochat hi sab gaanv manzaayo
 Asking and going around all around, jhopari ko kahun khoj na payo
 
 71
 
 dev nagar kai jachh poor, hon bhatakyo kit aay
 The name said to the city, so don't say anything
 
 So, do not say how you are in the community
 pathik jahaan jhankhaahin tahaan ke log anaise
 
 log anaise naahin, lakhu dwij dev nagar tain Kri curi hari dev, diya hai dev nagar kai 
 72
 
 Sundar Mahal mani-manik complex excess, subaran suraj-prakaas maano dai rahyu
 People of the city beat Sudama Zoo, bhenten akulaay joi soi pag chhuvai rahyu
 
 banbhani ke bhusan vividh vidhi dekhi kahyu Jahoun hoon nikkono so tamaso jag jawi rahayu
 aisi dasa phiri jab dwarika daras payo, Saris Sudamapur of Dwarka is Rahu

 Jaay dikhiyo sabni le, or hai mahaal tumhara 
 74
 
 Somewhere Sudama laughs, we do it kuti dikhaawahu mohin vah, jahaan baanjhni deen
 
 75
 
 dwarpal so tin kahi, kahi pathvahu yah gath
 Visited Vipra Mahabali, Dekhhu Hohu Sanath
 
 76
 
 Sunat went on with joy, all with Sakhiyan
 noopur kinkini dundubhi, manhu kaam chaturang
 
 77

 Broken Madia is my fairy tame pari dukh kaate kaha hem dham ri

 meri panditaini tihaare anuhaari pato Moko, tell me where can i get Bamri
 
 81
 
 It is chilling pandine kahan manju bhavan sa pyaare paron pine tiharoi ju gharu he
 Come, every other labor, how are you suffering, darid gamayo yon hansat gahri karu he
 
 riddhi siddhi daasi kari dinhin avinasi krisn, Puran Prakasi is Kamadhenu Koti Baru
 chalo pati bhuulo mati tumhen dinhon jadupati, Samprati is so beautiful with sleep

 4) Flexible law system: - Even though the constitution of our country is the largest and ideal constitution in the world in writing, in reality it is very flexible or otherwise, there are shabby laws, everyone here knows that if our If you have a license and are insured for a vehicle, then let anyone hit you, even if it is not the President of India, it will not matter
 Within 7 days you will get bail and then keep fighting
 If the insurance company will pay for the lifetime and the rest of the damage, then no matter to the driver or the motor owner, they live comfortably due to accidents and their life goes on just as they do every day
 If it is the party that is harmed, Apart from this, our other party is not said to be responsible in this whole case, because after the accident, they take the money in a lot of cases as penalty and later they say that they had to go
 So gone, what else can you do? You are getting less and less money
 That is fine, and finally, whoever made a mistake, gets acquitted, becomes free and lives on the road again
