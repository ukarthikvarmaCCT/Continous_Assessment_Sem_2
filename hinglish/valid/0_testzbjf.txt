 sar izac newton england ke ek vaigyanik the
 Who discovered the law of gravity and the principle of motion
 ve ek mahaan ganitagya, bhautik vaigyanik, jyotish evam darshanik the
 His research form "mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy" was published in 1687, in which the laws of universal gravitation and motion were explained and thus laid the foundation of sustainable physics
 unki philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica, 1687 main prakashit hui, yah vigyaan ke itihaas main apane aap main sabase prabhaavshaalee pustak he, jo adhikansh saahitiyik yantriki ke liye aadharbhoot kaary kii bhoomika nibhaati he
 In this work, Newton described three laws of universal gravitation and motion that dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries
 newton ne darshaya ki prithvi par vastuon kii gati or akashiya pindon kii gati kaa niyantran prakritik niyamon ke samaan samucchy ke dwaara hota he, ise darshane ke liye unhone grahiy gati ke kepler ke niyamon tathaa apane gurutvkarshan ke siddhant ke bich nirantarata sthapit kii, is prakaar se surya kendriyata or vaigyanik kranti ke aadhunikeekaran ke bare main pichley andeh ko dur kiya
 In mechanics, Newton established the principles of conservation of both momentum and angular momentum
 prakaashiki main, unhone pehla vyavhaarik paravarti doordarshee banaaya or is aadhaar par rang kaa siddhant viksit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko kai rangon main apaghatit kar detaa he jo drishy spectrum banaate hai
 He gave the rule of cooling and studied the speed of sound

 Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643, old style and new style dates | OS]]: 25 December 1642] in Woolsthorpe Manor in woolsthorpe-by-kolsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire
 newton ke janm ke samay, england ne grigorian calendar ko nahin apanaaya tha or isliye unke janm kii tithi ko christmas diwas 25 disambar1642 ke rup main darj kiya gaya
 Newton was born three months after his father's death, he was a prosperous farmer and his name was Isaac Newton
 purv paripakv avasthaa main paidaa hone vaala vah ek chota balak tha; unki mata hanna askf kaa kahana tha ki vah ek chauthai gaylen jaise chote se mag main samaa saktaa tha
 When Newton was three, her mother remarried and moved to live with her new husband, Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of her grandmother, Margerie Esqf
 The younger Isaac did not like his stepfather
 And had a sense of enmity with his mother for marrying her
 jaisaa ki 19 varsh tak kii aayu main unke dwaara kiye gaye aparaadhon kii suchi main pradarshit hota he: "maine mata or pita smith ke ghar ko jalaane kii dhamkee di
" From the age of twelve to the age of seventeen, he was educated at The King's School, Grantham
 He was expelled from school and in October 1659 he moved to woolsthorpe-by-kolstervorth, where his mother, who was widowed for the second time, gave him Insisted on making farmers
 vah kheti se nafrat karte the
 Master Henry Stokes of King's School asked his mother to send him back to school so that he could complete his education
 skool ke ek ladke ke khilaaf badla lene kii ichha se prerit hone kii vajah se ve ek sheersh kram ke chaatr ban gaye
 In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge as a sizar — a kind of work-study role
 us samay college kii shikshaayen arastu par aadhaarit thim
 But Newton wanted to read the ideas of more modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler
 1665 main unhone samanyikrut dwipad prameya kii khoj kii or ek ganitiya siddhant viksit karnaa shuru kiya jo baad main atyalp kalan ke naam se janaa gaya
 As soon as Newton received his degree in August 1665, the university was closed as a precaution to avoid the horrific epidemic of plague
 Although he was not distinguished as a Cambridge student, the following two years He studied privately at his home in Woolsthorpe and developed his theories on calculus, optics and the laws of gravity
 1667 main vah trinity ke ek phelo ke rup main cambridge laut aae
 Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed the least calculus independently using their own unique notations
 newton ke aantarik chakra ke anusaar, newton ne apni is vidhi ko libanij se kai saal pehle hi viksit kar diya tha, lekin unhone lagbhag 1693 tak apane kisi bhi kaary ko prakashit nahin kiya or 1704 tak apane kaary kaa puraa lekha jokha nahin diya
 is bich, libanij ne 1684 main apni vidhiyon kaa puraa lekha jokha prakashit karnaa shuru kar diya
 iske alaava, libanij ke sanketanon tathaa "avkalan kii vidhiyon" ko mahadweep par saarvatrik rup se apanaaya gaya or 1820 ke baad, british samrajya main bhi ise apanaaya gaya
 While Leibniz's pamphlets reflect the modernization of ideas from early stages to maturity, Newton's known notes have only the final result
 newton ne kaha ki ve apane kalan ko prakashit nahin karnaa chaahate the kyonki unhen dar tha ve uphaas kaa paatr ban jaayenge
 Newton had a very close relationship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fátio de Duillier, who had been heavily influenced by Newton's theory of gravitation since the beginning
 1691 main duiliar ne newton ke philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica ke ek nae sanskaran ko taiyaar karne kii yojana banaayi, lekin ise kabhi puraa nahin kar paae
baharhaal, in donon purushon ke bich sambandh 1693 main badal gaya
 At this time, Duillier also exchanged several letters with Leibniz
 1699 kii shuruyaat main, royal socity ke anya sadasyon ne libanij par saahitiyik chori ke aarope lagaaye or yah vivaad 1711 main purna rup se saamne aayaa
 a study by the Royal Society of Newton declared that Newton was the true inventor and that Leibniz had committed fraud
 yah adhyayan andeh ke ghere main aa gaya, jab baad paaya gaya ki newton ne khud libanij par adhyayan ke nishkarsh kii tippanee likhi
 Thus began the bitter Newton v
 Leibniz dispute, which continued in the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the death of Leibniz in 1716
 newton ko aam taur par samanyikrut dwipad prameya kaa shrey diya jaataa he, jo kisi bhi ghaat ke liye maanya he
 He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, graded cubic plane curves, made significant contributions to the theory of finite differences, he was the first to use fractional indices and the use of coordinate geometry to derive the solution of diophenatin equations
 did
 unhone laghuganak ke dwaara haraatmak shredhi ke aanshik yoga kaa sanniktan kiya, or ve pehle vyakti the jinhone aatmavishvaas ke saath ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa prayog kiya or ghaat shrinkhalaa kaa vilom kiya
 In 1669 he was elected a Lucasian Professor of Mathematics
 un dinon, cambridge yaa oxford ke kisi bhi sadsy ko ek nirdisht angreji pujari hona aavashyak tha
 However, the Lukesian professor was not required to be active in the church
 newton ne tark diya ki samanvay kii aavashyaktaa se unhen mukt rakhana chahie or charles dwitiya, jisaki anumati anivaary thi, ne is tark ko sweekaar kiya
 Thus a conflict arose between Newton's religious views and the English orthodoxy
 1670 se 1672 tak, newton kaa prakaashiki par vyaakhyaan diya
 is avadhi ke dauraan unhone prakaash ke apvartan kii khoj kii, unhone pradarshit kiya ki ek prism shwet prakaash ko rangon ke ek spectrum main viyojit kar detaa he or ek lens or ek doosraa prism bahuvarni spectrum ko sanyojit kar ke shwet prakaash kaa nirmaan karata he
 He also showed that the separation of colored light and shining on different objects does not change the properties of the colored light
 newton ne varnit kiya ki chaahe yah paravartit ho, yaa vikirit ho yaa sancharit ho, yah samaan rang kaa bana rahata he
 Thus, he observed that color is the result of the interaction of an object with already colored light, rather than the objects themselves producing colors
 yah newton ke rang siddhant ke rup main janaa jaataa he
 From this work he concluded that, the lens of any refractory telescope would experience diffusion in the colors of light, and to prove this concept, he constructed a telescope, using a mirror as an object, so that The problem can be solved
 Indeed, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involves shaping technology and solving the problem of an appropriate mirror material, according to the design of the design
 newton ne atyadhik paravartak veekshak dhaatu ke ek custom sanghathan se, apane darpan ko aadhaar diya, iske liye unke doordarshee hetu prakaashiki ki gunvattta kii jaanch ke liye newton ke chhallon kaa prayog kiya gaya
 By February 1669 he was able to produce an instrument without chromatic aberration
 1671 main royal socity ne unhen unke paravarti doordarshee ko prardashit karne ke liye kaha
 His interest encouraged him to publish his observations on color, which he later elaborated on as his optics
 jab robert hook ne newton ke kuch vichaaron kii aalochana kii, newton itnaa naaraaz hue ki ve saarvajanik bahes se baahar ho gaye
 Both remained enemies until Hook's death
 newton ne tark diya ki prakaash kanon yaa atisuksham kanon se bana he, jo saghan madhyam kii or jate samay apavartit ho jate hai, lekin prakaash ke vivartan ko spasht karne ke liye ise tarangon ke saath sambandhit karnaa jaruri tha
 
 Later physicists supported a pure wave-like explanation for the diffraction of light
 aaj kii kwantem yantriki, photone or tarang-kan yugmata ke vichaar, newton kii prakaash ke bare main samaj ke saath bahut kam samanta rakhte hai
 In his vision of light in 1675, Newton approved the presence of ether to transfer forces between particles
 brahm vidyavadi henry mor ke sampark main aane se rasayan vidya main unki ruchi punerjeevit ho gayi
 They replaced ether with occult forces based on airborne ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles
 John Maynard Keynes, who accepted many of Newton's writings on alchemy, states that "newton was not the first of the era of reason: he was the last of the magicians
 " rasayan vidya main newton kii ruchi unke vigyaan main yogadan se alag nahin kii ja sakati he
 If he had not relied on the secret idea of action at a distance through a vacuum, he would not have developed his theory of gravity
 1704 main newton ne optics ko prakashit kiya, jisamen unhone apane prakaash ke atisookshm kanon ke siddhant kii vistaar se vyakhya kii
unhone prakaash ko bahut hi sookshm kanon se bana hua mana, jabaki saadhaaran dravya bade kanon se bana hota he or unhone kaha ki ek prakaar ke rasinic roopantaran ke madhyam se "sakal nikaay or prakaash ek duusare main roopantarit nahin ho sakate hai, xxrep 7 
 or nikaay, prakaash ke kanon se apni gatividhi ke adhikansh bhaag ko praapt nahin kar sakate, jo unke sanghathan main pravesh karti he?" newton ne ek kaanch ke globe kaa prayog karte hue, ek gharshan vidyut sthitik janarator ke ek aadya rup kaa nirmaan kiya
 In 1677, Newton again began his work on mechanics, that is, with reference to Kepler's laws of gravity and planetary motion, the effect of gravity on the orbit of the planets and Hook and Flemsteed's consultation on the subject
 unhone jiram main di motu corporam main apane parinaamon kaa prakaashan kiya
 It was the introduction of the laws of motion that informed the Principia
 philosophy naturalis princepia methemetica kaa prakaashan edmund heli kii vittiya madad or protsaahan se 5 july 1687 ko hua
 In this work Newton gave three universal laws of motion in which no improvement has been made for more than 200 years
 unhone us prabhaav ke liye latin shabd gravitas kaa istemaal kiya jise gurutv ke naam se janaa jaataa he or saarvatrik gurutvkarshan ke niyam ko paribhaashit kiya
 In this work, he presented the first analytical proof of the speed of sound in air, based on Boyle's law
 bahut adhik duuri par kriya kar sakane vaale ek adrishy bal kii newton kii avadharana kii vajah se unki aalochana hui, kyonki unhone vigyaan main "gupt agenciyon" ko mila diya tha
 With the Principia, Newton gained international fame
 He received much acclaim, being an admirer of his, Switzerland-born Nicolas Fatio de Daulier, with whom he had a deep relationship, which ended in 1693 when Newton suffered from nerve blockages
 1690 ke dashak main, newton ne kai dharmik shodh likhe jo bible kii saahitiyik vyakhya se sambandhit the
 Henry More's belief in the universe and his rejection of Cartesian dualism probably influenced Newton's religious views
 unhone ek pandulipi jon loke ko bheji jisamen unhone trinity ke astitv ko vivaadit mana tha, jise kabhi prakashit nahin kiya gaya
 Subsequent works - The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended and Observations on the Professions of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St
 John - were published after his death
 unhone rasayan vidya ke liye bhi apana bahut adhik samay diya 
 Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701
 But according to some details his comments were always about a cold drought in the vault and he requested to close the window
 1696 main newton shahi taksaal ke warden kaa pad sanbhaalane ke liye landan chale gaye, yah pad unhen rajkosh ke tatkaaleen kuladhipati, helifax ke pehle arl, charles montagu ke sangrakshan ke madhyam se praapt hua
 He took over as the chief currency mover of England, somehow dancing at the behest of Master Lucas
 1699 main lucas kii mrityu newton shaayad taksaal ke sabase prasiddh master bane, is pad par newton apni mrityu tak bane rahe
ye niyuktiyaan daayitvaheen pad ke rup main lee gayin thim, lekin newton ne unhen gambhirtha se liya, 1701 main apane cambridge ke kartavyon se sevanivruth ho gaye or mudra main sudhaar laane kaa prayaas kiya tathaa kataranon tathaa nakli mudra banane waalon ko apni shakti kaa prayog karke sajaa di
 In "la of Queen Anne" as master of the mint in 1717, Newton inadvertently established the pound sterling from the silver standard to the gold standard, establishing a metallic relationship between silver money and gold coins in favor of gold
 Changed
 is kaaran se chaandi sterling sikke ko pighla kar britain se baahar bhej diya gaya
 Newton was made president of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Academic des Sciences
 royal sosayadi main apane pad par rahete hue, newton ne royal khagolvid jon flemustid ko shatru bana liya, unhone flemustid kii historica cholestis britanika ko samay se pehle hi prakashit karvaa diya, jise newton ne apane adhyayan main kaam main liya tha
 In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit at Trinity College, Cambridge
 yah nite kii padavi newton ko taksaal ke master ke rup main apni sevaao ke liye nahin di gayi thi or na hi unke vaigyanik kaary ke liye di gayi thi balki unhen yah oopaadhi may 1705 main sansadeey chunaav ke dauraan unke rajanithik yogadan ke liye di gayi thi
 Newton died in London on 31 March 1727, and was buried in Westminster Abbey

 Newton himself was hesitant to state his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676: If i have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of Giants Although historians generally believe that the above lines were an attack on Hook, other than - or rather than - a statement made with humility
 At that time there was a dispute between the two about the optical discoveries

 lekin 


 unhone apane nijee vishwaas kii saarvajanik ghoshnaa kabhi nahin kii- jisase is roodhiwaadee ko behad kattarpanthi jo samajha gaya
 He hid his faith so well that even today scholars are unable to know his personal beliefs
 " snobelen ne nishkarsh nikaala ki newton kam se kam ek soshinian sahanubhuti rakhte the,, sambhavatya arian ore lagbhag nishchit rup se ek trinity virdohi the

 In an approach disputed by Snowbelein, TC Fijnmeyer argued that Newton held the Eastern Orthodox view of the Trinity, not the Western view of Roman Catholicism, Britishism, and most Protestants

 iske liye libanij Condemned him: "almighty God wants to end his watch from time to time: otherwise it will be stopped to move

 Thus, the clarity and ingenuity of science were seen as a way to counter the emotional and spiritual exaggeration of both the threat of atheism and superstitious zeal, and at the same time, a second wave of English divinity led to Newton's discoveries
 Used to demonstrate the possibility of a "natural religion"

 His spokesman, Clarke, disapproved of Leibniz's theology, which freed God from the responsibility of "l'origine du mal", removing God from contributing to his creation, as Clarke said
 Was such a deity would be king by name only, but would be one step away from atheism
 But the undiscovered theological result of the success of Newton's system in the next century would reinforce the position of theism revealed by Leibniz
 duniya ke bare main samaj ab saadhaaran maanav ke kaaran ke str tak aa gayi or maanav, jaisaa ki odo mercward ne tark diya, buraai ke sudhaar or unmoolan ke liye uttaradaayi ban gaya
 On the other hand, the results of the ideas of the Late Latinian and Newtonian were far-reaching, a religious faction devoted to the concept of the mechanical universe, but with the same zeal and mystery that the Enlightenment struggled hard to destroy
 ek pandulipi jo unhone 1704 main likhi, jisame unhone bible se vaigyanik jaankaree nikaalane ke apane prayaas kaa varnan kiya he, unka anumaan tha ki duniya 2060 se pehle samaapt nahin hogi
 In this prophecy, he said, "it does not say what the final time will be, but i want to stop speculation about imaginary individuals who often make predictions about the end times and fail this prediction
" Holy prophecy is discredited upon leaving
 " Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of earlier scientists — Galileo, Boyle, and primarily Newton — as guiding and guaranteeing their application of the single concept of natural law and nature to every physical and social field of election day
 Gone

 It was Newton's conception of the universe based on natural and spiritually understandable rules that served as a seed for enlightenment ideology

 Monbodo and Samuel Clarke opposed elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalized it to ensure his strong religious views about nature

 Fraud was a very high treason for which there was a death sentence

 English law still had ancient and formidable customs of power, to separate all branches of government and establish all obstacles to prosecution
 newton ko shanti kaa nyaayadhish banaaya gaya or june 1698 or christmas 1699 ke bich unhone gavaah, mukhabiron or sandigdhon ke 200 parikshan karwaae
 Newton won his commitment and in February 1699 he had ten prisoners awaiting release
 raja ke vakil ke rup main newton kaa ek maamla wiliam chaloner ke khilaaf tha
 Chaloner's plan was to set up a fake conspiracy of Catholics and then turn them into hapless conspirators whom he held hostage
 chaloner ne apane aap ko paryaapt samrudh sajjan bana liya
 While applying in Parliament, the Chaloner also provided equipment for making fake coins in the mint
 He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the mint processes so that he could do something to improve it
 usne sansad main arji di ki sikkon kii dhalaai ke liye uski yojana ko sweekaar kar liya jaye taaki jaalsaji na kii ja sake, jabaki usee samay jaali sikke saamne aaye
 Newton tested cheating on Chaloner and in September 1697 sent him to New Gate Prison
 lekin chalonor ke ucch sthanon par mitra the, jinhone use uski rihaai ke liye madad kii
 Newton tested it for the second time with conclusive evidence
 chaloner ko ucch rajdroh kaa doshi paaya gaya tha or use 23 march 1699 ko tiburn gelos main faansee de kar dafna diya gaya
 According to Newton's first law, an object which is in steady state will remain constant and an object which is in the same state of motion will move in the same direction with the same speed until an external force acts on it
 newton ke duusare niyam ke anusaar ek vastu par lagaaya gaya bal f → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {F}}} \ vec{, samay ke saath iske samveg p → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {p}}} \ vec{ main parivartan kii dar ke baraabar hota he
 In mathematical terms it can be expressed as follows chunki doosraa niyam ek sthir dravyaman kii vastu par lagu hota he,, pehla pad lupt ho jaataa he or twaran kii paribhaasha kaa upyog karte hue pratisthaapan ke dwaara sameekaran ko sanketon ke rup main nimnanusaar likhaa ja saktaa he The first and second laws represent the breaking of Aristotle's physics, in which it was believed that a force was necessary to maintain motion
 ve rajya main vyavastha kii gati kaa ek uddeshy he rajya badalane ke liye hai ki ek hi shakti kii jarurat he
 The SI unit of force is named Newton in honor of Newton
 newton ke tisare niyam ke anusaar prayek kriya kii baraabar or vipareet pratikriya hoti he
 This means that whenever one object exerts a force on another object then the second object exerts the same force on the first object in the opposite direction
 iskaa ek saamaanya udahaaran he do aais skates ek duusare ke vipareet khiskate hai to vipareet dishaao main khisakane lagate hai
 Another example is the backward thrust of the gun, in which the force exerted by the gun to fire the bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun which the gunner feels
 chunki prashn main jo vasteen hai, aisa jaruri nahin ki unka dravyaman baraabar ho, isliye donon vastuon kaa parinami twaran alag ho saktaa he 
 Unlike Aristotle, Newton's physics has become universal
 udhaaharan ke liye, doosraa niyam grahon tathaa ek girte hue pathar par bhi lagu hota he
 The vector nature of the second law establishes a geometric relationship between the direction of force and the type of change in momentum of the object
 newton se pehle, aam taur par yah mana jaataa tha ki surya ke chaaron or ghurnan kar rahe ek grah ke liye ek agragami bal aavashyak hota he jisaki vajah se yah gati karata rahata he
 Newton showed that instead of this, an attraction force inside the Sun is required
 yahan tak ki princepia ke prakaashan ke kai dashakon ke baad bhi, yah vichaar saarvatrik rup se sweekrut nahin kiya gaya
 And many scientists preferred Descartes's theory of Vorticas
 newton aksar khud ek kahani kehete the ki ek ped se ek girte hue seb ko dekh kar ve gurutvkarshan kaa siddhant banane ke liye prerit ho paae
 Later cartoons were made to satirize where the apple was seen falling on Newton's head and it was demonstrated that its influence somehow introduced Newton to the force of gravity
 His booklets showed that in the late 1660s Newton's idea that terrestrial gravity expanded, it was inversely proportional to the square of the moon; However, it took him two decades to develop the complete theory
 jon kanadyuit, jo royal taksaal main newton ke sahyogi the or newton kii bhatiji ke pati bhi the, ne is ghatana kaa varnan kiya jab unhone newton ke jivan ke bare main likhaa: In 1666 he retired from Cambridge again and moved to Lincolnshire near his mother
 jab ve ek baag main gum rahe the tab unhen ek vichaar aayaa ki gurutv kii shakti dharti se ek nishchit duuri tak simit nahin he, lekin yah shakti usase kahin zyada aage vistrut ho sakati he jitna ki pehle aam taur par sochaa jaataa tha
 He told himself whether it would be as high as the moon and if so, it would affect his speed and possibly keep it in its orbit, what was the effect of the logic they were calculating
 
 sawaal gurutv ke astitv kaa nahin tha balki yah tha ki kya yah bal itnaa vistrut he ki yah chaand ko apni kaksha main banaaye rakhane ke liye uttaradaayi he
 Newton showed that if the force decreases in square inverse of distance, the lunar orbital period can be calculated and a good result can be obtained
 unhone anumaan lagaaya ki yahi bal anya kakshiya gati ke liye jimmedaar he or isiilie ise saarvatrik gurutvkarshan kaa naam de diya
 William Stukele, a contemporary writer, recounts the life of Sir Isaac Newton in his memory, recalling a conversation he had with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, when Newton mentioned that "the idea of gravity in his mind When did it come first? jab vah dhyaan kii mudra main baithe the usee samay ek seb ke girane ke kaaran aisa hua
 Why does this apple always fall perpendicular to the ground? He thought so in himself
 yah bagal main yaa upar kii ore kyon nahin jaataa he, balki hameshaa prithvi ke centre kii ore hi girtaa he
 "in similar terms, Voltaire wrote in an essay on epic poetry," Sir Isaac Newton was wandering in his gardens, looking at an apple falling from a tree, he first thought of the system of gravity
 vibhinn pedo ko "vah" seb ke ped hone kaa daawa kiya jaataa he jiskaa newton ne varnan kiya he
 The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, and after a few years it was brought down with roots and planted in the headmaster's garden
 neshnal trust jo woolsthrope menor kaa maalik he, kaa vartmaan staff is par vivaad karata he, ore daawa karata he ki vah ped unke bageeche main upasthit he jis ke bare main newton ne baat kii
 a descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room in which Newton lived while studying
 brogdel main rashtriya falon kaa sangrah un pedo se grapht kii aapurti kar saktaa he, jo flower of kent ke samaan dikhaai detaa he, jo ek mote goode kii pakaane kii kism he

 keshav yaa keshavadas 1555 vikrami or mrityu 1618 vikrami) hindi sahitya ke reetikaal kii kavi-trayee ke ek pramukh stambh hai
 He is an ancient Acharya and poet of Hindi who has given a proper introduction to Sanskrit poetry
 inkaa janm sanadhy brahman kul main hua tha
 His father's name was Kashiram, who was a special affection of Odchanaresh Madhukarshah
 madhukarshah ke putr maharaj indrajit singh inke mukhya ashrayadata the
 He considered Keshav as his guru
 rasikapriya ke anusaar keshav orcha rajtargat tungarai ke nikat betwa nadi ke kinare sthit orcha nagar main rahete the
 Acharya Keshavdas was born in 1546 AD in Orchha
 ve sanay brahman the
 His father's name was Kashinath
 orchha ke rajdurbar main unke parivaar kaa bada maan tha
 Keshavdas himself was the court poet, minister and guru of Indrajeet Singh, brother of Orchha Naresh Maharaj Ramsingh
 indrajit singh kii ore se inhen ikkis gaanv mili hue the
 He lived a luxurious life with self-respect
 keshavadas sanskrit ke udbhat vidwaan the
 Sanskrit was also promoted in his family
 naukar-chaakar bhi sanskrit bolte the
 In his family too, leaving Sanskrit and poetry in Hindi language, he found it somewhat humiliating - keshav bade bhavuk or rasik vyakti the
 It is said that once in old age he was sitting at a well
 vahaan pani bharne ke liye ai hui kuch striyon ne unhen baba kahkar sambodhan kiya
 On this, he said the following couplet - samvath 1608 ke lagbhag jahangir ne orchha kaa rajya vir singh dev ko de diya
 Keshav stayed in the court of Veer Singh for some time, then went to the Gangat and started living there
 1618 isvi main unka dehavsaan ho gaya
 The nine authentic texts composed by Keshavdas are: Rasikapriya, Kavipriya, Nakhshikh, Chandmala, Ramachandrika, Veerasinghdeva Charit, Ratanbavani, Vigyanagita and Jahangir Jaschandrika
 rasikapriya keshav kii praudh rachana he jo kavyashastra sambandhi granth hai
 Symptoms of rasa, vritti and kavyadoshas are given in it
 iske mukhya aadhargranth hai - naatyashaastra, kamasutra or rudrabhatt kaa shringartilak
 Kavipriya is a poetry-related treatise which was presented for Indrajit Singh's Rakshita and Keshav's disciple Pravinaray
 yah kaviklpaltavriti or kavyadarsh par aadhaarit he
 Ramachandrika is his most famous epic, in which the content has been taken from many texts like Prasannaraghava, Hanumannakataka, Kadambari etc
 ratanbavanee main madhukarshah ke putr ratansen, veerasingh charit main indrajeetsingh ke anuj veerasingh tathaa jahangir jaschandrika kaa yashogaan kiya gaya he
 There is non-scriptural poetry based on Prabodh Chandrodaya in Vigyangeetha
 keshav alankaar sampradaiwaadee acharya kavi the
 Therefore it was natural that they would follow the Acharyas of the Alankar sect like Bhamah, Uddhat and Dandi
 inhone alankaaron ke do bhed maane hai, saadhaaran or vishisht
 Under the ordinary description, Variya, Bhumishree-narration and Rajyashree-narration, which are based on poetic imagery and ornamentation
 is tarah ve alankaarya or alankaar main bhed nahin maanate
 Due to a special interest in ornaments, the poetic aspect has been suppressed and these are generally not considered to be gentle poets
 apni clishtataa ke kaaran ye kathin kavy ke pret kahe gaye hai
 Specific management is not excellent in terms of Ramachandrika management, identification of poignant places, nature description etc
 parampara paalan tathaa adhikadhik alankaaron ko samavisht karne ke kaaran varnanon kii bharmaar he
 In the description of chahal-pahal, Nagar Shobha, Decoration etc
, he has more mood
 sanvaadon kii yojana main, naatakeey tatwon ke sannivesh ke kaaran, inhen vishesh safalataa mili he
 Their simplicity has been expressed at more places in the Muktakas than in the arrangements
 keshav darbari kavi the
 Like other courtly poets, they have also celebrated their refugee kings
 vir singh dev charit or jahangir jas chandrika unki aisi hi rachanaaen hai
 The second form of Keshava is that of Acharya
 kavi-priya or rasik-priya main inhone sanskrit ke lakshan, granthon kaa anuwaad kiya or udhaaharan swaroop apni kavitaaon kii rachana kii
 The theme of Ram Chandrika is Rama-bhakti but Keshava poets were first, devotees later
 atah unamem bhakthi-bhaavana kii apeksha kavy-chamatkaar ke pradarshan kii bhaavana adhik he
 In the Science Gita, Keshav expresses feelings related to asceticism
 rajdarbaron kii saaj-sajja ke bich rahane ke kaaran keshav kii pravriti prakruti main nahin rahi
 His nature-portrayal is flawed
 usamen parampara kaa nirvaad adhik he, moulikta or naveenta kam
 Keshav has not even taken care of time and place in narrating
 alankaaron ke boj se dabi prakruti apana sahan saundarya kho baithi he
 Keshav's fantasies regarding nature have become very inconsistent and uninteresting at some places
 arun surya ko kapalik kaal kaa rakt se bharaa kapaal bana dena kase kaa chakar prathit hoga - Being a court poet, the eloquence of the courts was present in Keshav
 atah sanvaadon kii yojana main unhen asaadhaaran safalataa mili
 His dialogues are very attractive
 unamem rajdarbaron jaisi haazir-javaabi or shishtataa he
 The characters are inaugurated beautifully by them
 janak-vishwamitra samvaad, lav-kush samvaad, sita-hanuman samvaad isi prakaar ke samvaad hai
 See an answer and answer under 'angad-ravana-dialogue' - ravan- Angad- acharya keshavadas ucchkoti ke vidwaan the
 Therefore, there is more yoga in his poetry and imagination
 unka dhyaan jitna paanditya-pradarshan kii ore tha utana bhav-pradarshan kii ore nahin
 Due to this trend of erudition, some critics have called Keshav a heartless poet, but this allegation is not completely true, because along with the performance of erudition, there are many places in Keshav's poetry where his sentimentality and warm-heartedness came true
 is
 ashok vatika main hanuman ji sita ji ko ramchandra ji kii mudrika dete hai
 How expressive Sita ji's statement towards the ring is- keshav ne apane kavy kaa madhyam brajabhasha ko banaaya, parantu brajabhasha kaa jo dhalaa hua rup sur aadi asht chhap ke kaviyon main miltaa he vah keshav kii kavita main nahin
 Keshav was a Sanskrit scholar, so his language is heavily influenced by Sanskrit
 unhone sanskrit ke tatsam shabdon ko hi nahin, sanskrit kii vibhaktiyon ko bhi apanaaya he, kahin-kahin to unke chhandon kii bhashaa sanskrit hi jaan padati he- There is also a lot of mixture of Bundelkhandi language in Keshav's language
 khaarak, thorila, dugai, gauramadine aadi jaise bundeli shabdon kaa prayog baraabar unke kavy main hua
 Words of the period language are also used
 jaise - ihaan, uhaan, dikhau, rijhaau aadi
 Keshav has coined the words at some places
 jaise - chaap se chaapkeey
 Even in the use of obsolete words, he worked with complete freedom
 jaise - alok, laanch, nari aadi
 The use of the word poison in the meaning of water is found only in the language of Keshava - sanskrit or bundelkhandi ke atyadhik prabhaav, lambii-lambii shabd-yojana aprachlit shabdon ke prayog aadi ke kaaran keshav kii bhashaa main kahin-kahin atyant vilshtataa aa gai he
 The general form of Keshav's language is relatively intelligible
 usamen kahawaton or muhaavaron kaa bhi yatha-sthaan prayog hua he
 Look at the use of the phrase Lajna die - keshav kii style par unke vyaktitv kii chhap spasht drushtigochar hoti he is sambandh main unhone apane kisi purv kavi kaa anusaran nahin kiya
 His poetry can be easily identified among the poems of many poets
 sankshep main keshav kii style praudh or gambhir he
 Because of erudition, she has become somewhat arrogant
 keshav das ji ne apane kavy main anek sthalon par vividh rason kii utkrisht vyanjana kii he, kintu mukhyatah ve shringaar or vir ras ke kavi hai
 They have adopted both sides of the makeup
 virochit utsaah ke maarmik varnan main to ve apni sani nahin rakhte
 How encouraging is Kush's statement to Sita, lamenting Shatrughan's arrows for unconscious love
 chhandon ke vishay keshav kaa gyaan apaar tha
 No one in Hindi literature has used all the types of verses
 ramchandrika main to chhandon kii vividhta is seemaa tak pahunch gai he ki vidwaanon ne use shabdon kaa ajaayabaghar kah diya he
 Keshav himself wrote - keshav kii chand yojana sanskrit sahitya kii chand yojana he
 He has also successfully used verses like Kavita, Savaiya, Doha etc
 keshav ko alankaaron se vishesh moh tha unke anusaar - Hence, the use of different figures of speech in his poetry appears everywhere
 alankaaron ke boj se kavita ke bhav dab se gaye hai or pathak ko keval chamatkaar haath lagata he
 Where Keshav does not have a strong request for the alankar-yojana, his poetry is extremely heartwarming and succulent
 upama-alankaar kaa ek udhaaharan dekhie- dasharath-maran ke uparaant bharat jab mahal main pravesh karte hai to ve maataaon ko vriksh viheen lataaon ke samaan pate hai
 Keshav Dasji is the first teacher of Hindi literature
 hindi main sarv pratham unhone hi kavy ke vibhinn angon kaa shastreey paddati se vivechan kiya
 It is fitting that in his poetry, the art aspect is more important than the emotional aspect and because of his erudition, he is called as the phantom of difficult poetry, but his importance does not disappear at all
 acharya ramchandra shukla ke shabdon main keshav kii rachana main sur, tulsi aadi kii si saralata or tanmayata chaahe na ho par kavyangon kaa vistrut parichay kara kar unhone aage ke liye maarg kholaa
 Keshavdas ji was virtually a great poet
 sur or tulsi ke pashchaat hindi-kavy-jagat main unheen kii hi gananaa kii jaati he- a Picture from Rasikapriya, 1610 chitra rasikapriya se, 1610 Three natural available hydrogen or hydrogen u) hydrogen ekmaatr aisa tatva he, jiske samasthanikon ko iske naam se swatantra alag naam mili hue hai

 According to Naithani there was an ancient South Kali temple and the then temple priest had predicted that many people would come to Srinagar

 Most of the people of Bishnupriya Manipuri migrated from Manipur and took refuge in Assam, Tripura, Sylhet and Cachar during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries due to internal conflicts between the princes of Assam, Manipur and the invasion of Burma

 pranayam yoga ke aath angon main se ek he
 Pranayama = Prana + Dimension
 iskaa kaa shabdic arth he - 'praan ko lambaa karnaa' yaa 'praan ko lambaa karnaa'
 In the Hathayogapradipika it is said- yah bhi kaha gaya he- Pranayama is made up of the sum of two words - the first word is "prana" and the second is "dimension"
 praan kaa arth jo hamen shakti detaa he yaa bal detaa he
 To know the meaning of dimension, it has to be severed because it is made up of the sum of two words
 isamen mul shabd '"yam" ' he 'aa' upsarg laga he
 The meaning of yam is 'motion' and the prefix "aa" is used in the sense of 'inverted', that is, dimension means inversion
 atah pranayam main aayam ko 'ulataa gaman ke arth main prayog kiya gaya he
 Thus Pranayama means' the reverse movement of Prana
 yahan yah dhyaan dene ki baat he ki pranayam praan ke ulataa gaman ke vishesh kriya kii sangya he na ki uskaa parinaam
 That is to say, the word pranayama should indicate the specific action of life
 pranayam ke bare main bahut se rishiyon ne apane-apane dhang se kaha he lekin sabhi ke bhav ek hi he jaise patanjali kaa pranayam sutara evam gita main jisamen patanjali kaa pranayam sutara mahatvapurn mana jaataa he jo is prakaar he- tasmin sati shwasaprashwasayorgativiched:pranayam
 iskaa hindi anuwaad is prakaar hoga- shwaas prashwaas ke gati ko alag karnaa pranayam he
 According to this sutra, for doing pranayama, first of all there should be a proper interpretation of the sutra, but before interpreting the pranayama sutra of Patanjali, we should note that Patanjali compiled the activities and upanayas of yoga in a book called Yogasutra
 Has done and the meaning of the formula is - a certain rule which is mathematic and scientific
 yadi sutara kii sahi vyakhya nahin hui to uttar satya se dur evam parinaam shunya hoga
 If you want to do pranayam according to Patanjali's pranayama sutra, then first of all, his pranayama sutra tasmin sati svasprashapyayogaartivakshya: pranayama॥ There should be a proper interpretation that is scriptural, scientific, logical, and mathematical
 isi vyakhya ke anusaar kriya karnaa hoga
 For this, the words used in the sutra should be understood and the special strategy of breaking the motion given in it has to be known
 iske liye patanjali ke pranayam sutara main prayukt shabdo kaa arth bodh hona chaiye
 Breathing at a slow speed, stopping and exhaling comes in the order of pranayama
 shwaas khinchne ke saath bhaavana karen ki praan shakti, shreshthata shwaas ke dwaara andar khinchi ja rahi he, chhodte samay yah bhaavana karen ki hamaare durgun, dushpravritiyaan, bure vichaar prashwaas ke saath baahar nikal rahe hai
 When we breathe, we do not just draw air, then we pull all the energy of the universe with it
 ab aapako lagegaa kii sirf saans khichne se aisa kaisaa hoga
 The breath that we draw in the lungs is not just breathing, it contains all the energy of the whole universe
 maan lo jo saans aapke puure sharir ko chalaanaa janati he, wo aapke sharir ko durust karne kii bhi takat rakhti he
 Pranayama should be done with the following chant
 bhuh bhuvah swah mahah, janah tapah satyam
 ॐ Tatsviturvarnayanam bhargo devasya dhimhi dhiyo yo na prachodayat
 apojyotirsomritan, brahm bhurbhuvah swah 
 Pranayama has great importance in yoga
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 Fill the long breath in the lungs with the nose, then leave the long breath through the lungs
 Keep the same pressure while breathing and exhale
 hamen hamaari galtiyaan sudharni he, ek to ham puri saans nahin lete; or doosraa hamaari saans pet main chali jaati he
 See there are two ways in our body, one and the other
 Just as the lungs have a system of purifying the air, the stomach does not
 usee ke kaaran hamaare sharir main oxygen kii kami mahasoos hoti he or usee ke kaaran hamaare sharir main rog judate he
 Sit in Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Padmasana, Vajrasana and while throwing the breath out, you have to push the stomach inward, just keep breathing in it
 do sanson ke bich apane aap saans andar chali jaayegi, jaan-boojh kar saans ko andar nahin lenaa he
 Kapal says the front part of the brain, Bhati says Jyoti, Kanti, Tej; By continuously doing Kapalbhati Pranayama, the beauty of the face increases
 kapaalbhaati pranayam dharti kii sanjivani kehalaata he
 While doing Kapalbhati Pranayama one has to focus on the Muladhara Chakra
 isse muladhar chakra jaagrath ho kar kundlini shakti jaagrath hone main madad hoti he
 While doing Kapalabhati Pranayama, it is to think that all the negative elements of our body are going out of the body
 khaanaa mili naa mili magar roj kam se kam 5 minutes kapaalbhaati pranayam karnaa hi he, yah drudh sanklop karnaa he
 Sit in Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Padmasana, Vajrasana
 saans ko puri tarah baahar nikaalane ke baad saans baahar hi roke rakhane ke baad teen bandh lagaate hai
 1) Jalandhar Bandh: - By shrinking the neck completely, keep the chin close to the chest
 2) uddyaan bandh :- pet ko puri tarah andar peeth kii taraf kheenchna he
 3) Basic bandage: - The place of excretion of our feces has to be pulled completely upwards
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 The beginning and the end always have to be done with the left nostril, close the right nostril of the nose and take a long breath from the left, then close the left, exhale long breath from the right one


 Now take a long breath from the right and leave the left one
 


 That is, keep this sequence right-to-left-left, repeat this process for 10-15 minutes
 While breathing, you should concentrate on the command cycle located between the two eyes
 or man hi man main saans lete samay - kaa jaap karte rahanaa chahie
 Our body's 72,72,10,210 micro pulse are purified
 baanyi naadee ko chandra nadee, or baanyi nadee ko surya naadee kehete hai
 The cold air enters from Chandra Nadi and the hot air from Surya Nadi goes inside
 thandi or garam hawa ke upyog se hamaare sharir kaa taapmaana santulit rahata he
 This increases our immune power
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 Close the ears completely with both the thumbs, place two fingers on the forehead and put six fingers on both eyes
 or lambii saans lete hue kanth se bhavaren jaisaa aawaaj nikaalnaa he
 Sir, i have come to the conclusion after continuous practice of the last five years: - If you start breathing in the Anulom Antonym Pranayama, if you start breathing from right nostril and finally from right nostril then anger and irritation persists in the mind! And conversely, if the breath is started from the left nostril and at the end the breath is exhaled from the left nostril then the mind remains calm! sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 And with the mother-in-law, you have to chant Oum with your mouth
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 And sitting silently in the mind, taking long breaths and chanting Oum
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 It is not like Kapalbhati Pranayama in action, do not breathe out again and again
 saas ko puri tarah baahar nikal ke baad baahar hi roak ke pet ko aage peeche karnaa he
 Sit in Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Padmasana, Vajrasana
 sikude huve gale se saas ko andar lenaa he
 Sit in Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Padmasana, Vajrasana
 jiva taalu ko lagaake dono jabade band karke lenaa or us choti si jagah se si si karat hue hawa ko andar khichna he
 And by closing the mouth, leave the breath out of the nose
 jaise e• si• ke phins hote he, usase e• si• ke kanmpressor par kam dabaav aata he or garam hawa baahar phekane se hamaari kaksha kii hawa thandi ho jaati he
 In the same way, we can reduce the excess heat of our body
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 With the shape of our mouth "0", take out the organism from it, our living will also become "0", the air has to be drawn from the same part
 or munh band karke se saans ko naak se baahar chhod de
 Sit in Sukhasana, Siddhasana, Padmasana, Vajrasana
 hamaare munh kaa " 0 " aakaar karke usase jiva ko baahar nikaalnaa, hamaari jivha bhi " 0 " aakaar kii ho jaayegi, usee bhaag se hawa andar khichni he
 And by closing the mouth, leave the breath out of the nose
 sukhasana, siddhasana, padmasana, vajrasana main baithen
 With the shape of our mouth "0", take out the organism from it, our living will also become "0", the air has to be drawn from the same part
 or munh band karke se saans ko naak se baahar chhod de

 is panth yaa skool ke shishyon ko asharia ke naam se janaa jaataa he, or skool ko ashari skool bhi kaha jaataa he, jo sunni islam ke bheetar pramukh panth ban gaya
 It is considered to be one of the orthodox schools of theology in Sunni Islam, along with the Maturidi Theology School is also considered a popular school
 sabase mashhoor ashariyon main al-behaqi, al-navavi, al gajali, iz al-deen ebn 'abd al-salaam, al-suuti, ebn 'asakir, ebn hajar al- asakalani, al-kurtubi or al-subki prasidd hai
 Abu al-hasan al-ash'ari is famous for his atomism, Ashari was one of the first Islamic philosophers to believe that Allah created every moment in time and with particles of matter
 phir bhi unhone swatantra ichha vaad main vishwaas kiya
 Also expanded the ideas of Dar ibn Amr and Abu Hanifa
 jabaki al-ashaari ne mutajili skool ke tark par jor dene ke vichaaron kaa virodh kiya, ve is vichaar kaa bhi virodh kiya jis vichaar main bahes karnaa nahin tha
 Arguing Some schools with ideas of mind such as Zahiri, Mujassimai and Muhaddithin, Ashari have opposed these schools in Istihasan al-khaud: ashravaad praarambhik islamic darshan kaa mukhya vidhyalay ban gaya, jisase mul rup se abu al-hasan al-ashaari dwaara nirdhaarit neenv par aadhaarit tha, jinhone 10 veen shatabdi main apane shikshak abdulla ebn said ebn kullab dwaara sikhaai gai paddati ke aadhaar par skool kii sthapana kii thi
 This school underwent many changes in history as a result of which the word Ashari was extremely widespread in modern usage, for example the differences between Ibn Fawraq and al-bayhaqi
 ashaaria vichaar yah tha ki adwitiya prakruti or allaah kii visheshtaon kii samaj maanav kshamta se pare thi
 To solve these problems, the solution proposed by Abu al-hasan al-ashari is to test and record the names of Allah mentioned in the Quran
 in naamon or visheshtaon ke rup main sakaaratmak vaastaviktaa he, ve saar se alag hai, lekin phir bhi unke paas astitv yaa vaastaviktaa nahin he
 al-ashari's motivation in this case was on the one hand to separate abstracts and concepts as concepts, and on the other hand to see that the concentration between essence and virtue should be situated not on the quantitative but on the qualitative level - Some of these things failed to be understood by the school of thinking
 asharia yaa ashariyat drushtikon main yah bate ahm hai: German Orientalist Eduard Sachou blamed the fallacy of Islamic science in the tenth century, especially the theology of Ashari and its greatest defender, al-ghazali, and noted that the Muslim world was "galileos, Keplers and Newton" because of the religious interruption of both
 Could not be made
 haalanki, anya log tark dete hai ki ashariyon ne na keval vaigyanik tareekon ko sweekaar kiya balki unhen badhaava bhi diya
 Ziauddin Sardar states that some of the greatest Muslim scientists such as Ibn al-haytham and Abu Rehan al-biruni were pioneers of the scientific method, they were followers of the Ashari school of Islamic theology
 anya ashariyon kii tarah, jo maanate the ki vishwaas yaa takalid keval islam ke liye lagu hona chahie, na ki kisi bhi pracheen helenistic adhikariyon ke liye, ebn al- hetham kaa vichaar he ki taklid keval islam ke paigambaron kii honi chahie, na ki kisi anya praadhikaran ke liye
 Some authors have questioned the metaphysical value of discussion methods employed by Asharites and other bilingual theologians
 fakhr al-deen al-razi, swayan ashar skool ke ek pramukh vyakti the, unhone kaha: "maine un sabhi vidhiyon ko niojit kiya jo darshan or dwaitiki pradaan karte the, lekin ant main mujhe ehsaas hua ki ye vidhiyaan na to thake hue dil ke liye santvanaa laa sakati hai or na hi pyaase kii pyaas buja sakati hai
 The method provided by the Quran is the best method and reality

 Calculus is a major area of mathematics in which mathematical study of the transformation of zodiac signs is done
 isaki do mukhya shakhaayen hai- avakal ganit tathaa samakalan ganit 
 These two branches of calculus are interrelated by the fundamental theorem of calculus
 vartmaan samay main vigyaan, ejiniyari, arthshaastra aadi ke kshetra main calculas kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 Many concepts related to calculus in India were developed in the 14th century itself
 kintu paramparaagat rup se yahi manyata he ki calculas kaa prayog 17veen shatabdi ke uttarardh main aarambh hua tathaa ijak newton tathaa labnij iske janak the
 Integration This is a special form of addition in which numbers with finer values are added
 kisi vakr tathaa x-aksh ke bich kaa kshetrafal nikaalane ke liye samakalan kaa prayog karnaa padataa he
 Differentiation studies the rate of instantaneous change of one amount relative to another
 is dar ko 'avkalaj' kehete hai
 Measures the rate of growth of a function with a variable amount
 jaise yadi koi falan y kisi char russi x par nirbhar he or x kaa maan x1 se x2 karne par y kaa maan y1 se y2 ho jaataa he to / ko y kaa x ke sandarbh main avkalaj kehete hai
 It is represented by dy / dx
 dhyaan rahe ki parivartan sookshm se sookshmatam hona chaiye
 That is why the boundary has a very important place in the differential
 kisi vakr kaa kisi bindu par pravanta jaanane ke liye us bindu par avkalaj kii gananaa kerani padati he
 Ie mana f = x2 ek falan he jiskaa avakal neeche dikhaaya gaya he- The main credit for the development of calculus is given to Labnees and Isaac Newton
 kintu isaki jaden bahut puraani hai
 Madhav, the great mathematician from Kerala, India, discussed many important components of calculus in the fourteenth century and thus laid the foundation for calculus
 unhone tailor shrenee, anant shreniyon kaa sannictikaran, abhisaran kaa intigral test, avkalan kaa aarmabhik rup, araikhik samikarnon ke hal kaa punaravarti hal, yah vichaar ki kisi vakr kaa kshetrafal uskaa samakalan hota he, aadi vichaar unhone bahut pehle likh diya
 Farma and Japanese mathematician Seki Kova also contributed to this

 The understanding and development of concepts such as function, boundary, continuum, class to infinity, extreme, etc
 gave birth to calculus
 'samakalan or avkalan ek duusare ke vyutkram kriyaayen hai'
 The two theorems that confirm this statement are called the fundamental theorems of calculus

 Calculus is used in all physical sciences, engineering, computer science, statistics, economics, commerce, medicine, and other fields
 jahaan bhi kisi dizin samasya kaa ganitiya model banaaya ja saktaa ho or ishtatam hal praapt karnaa ho, kalan kaa upyog kiya jaataa he
 With the help of calculus, we are able to move easily with the variable rates of change

 It is absolutely necessary to understand the characteristics of these qualities in order to understand the roundabout well
 newton ke pratham gatinium ke anusaar koi bhi pind jis avasthaa main rahata he usee main bana rahanaa chahta he or us avasthaa main kisi prakaar ke parivartan kaa virodh karne kii pravriti pradarshit karata he
 This tendency is called inertia
 apni dhuree par bhraman karata hua roter apane praarambhik tal main hi paribhraman karnaa chahta he or koi balghurna sthapit karne par uskaa virodh karata he
 The second feature of the rotor of a rotary rotary is the protraction
 paribhraman karte hue kisi pind ke koniya samveg main parivartan karne ke liye ek balaghurna aavashyak hota he
 If the axes of the thrust and angular momentum are coincident, then an angular acceleration is produced in that body, but the plane of rotation of that body remains unchanged
 iske vipareet yadi ukt donon aksh paraspar sam-konik hote hai, to pind ke koniya veg main koi antar nahin aata, kintu paribhraman kaa tal swayan hi ghoomane lagata he

 It is due to angular momentum that the properties of firmness and inertia are included in the rotational system
 kisi pind par jab koi balyugma kaary karata he, tab us pind main balyugma ke aksh ke chaaron ore ek koniya samveg utpann ho jaataa he, jiske kaaran pind main us aksh ke chaaron or bhrami karne kii pravriti utpann ho jaati he
 The angular velocity of that body will increase as long as it continues to work
 nimnlikhit sameekaran ghurnakshadarshi ke gun ko abhivyakt karata he- Where the vector τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau}}} and l → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {L}}} are the convolutional and angular momentum superimposed on the rotoscope, respectively
 adish i iskaa jadtwaghurna he, sadish ω → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ omega }}} iskaa koniya veg he, or sadish α → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ alpha }}} koniya twaran he
 It is clear from this equation that if the rotating τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau}}} is placed perpendicular to the rotating-axis, it causes τ → { \ displaystyle { \ vec { \ tau}}} and l → { \ displaystyle { \ vec {L}}} will generate vertical displacement of both
 is gati ko purassaran kehete hai
 The angular velocity of the precession will be the following: maan liya, ek baari chakra ek kshaitij dhuree k-kha par nartan kar rahaa he
 The two forces f and f at both ends of the axis are acting in such a way that a forcem is formed from them
 isse utpann hone vaala balghurna g = F

 As a result, this entire system will begin to be propagated around another longitudinal axis

 Therefore, if the angular momentum i w of the circle is very high, then the value of w ¢ will be very low

 If a rotator is placed at a location on the earth plane in such a way that its land axis is horizontal in the east-west direction, the earth's revolutions as well as its entire structure will revolve around the center of the earth, because each time the surface of that structure Will remain perpendicular to the earth plane
 kintu apane jadtv tathaa atyadhik koniya samveg ke kaaran bhoomi aksh apni praarambhik disha ke hi samaantar rahegaa
 Therefore, due to the revolutions of the Earth, the illusion, which was initially parallel to the Earth's plane, would be seen making a few angles per moment

 Although, for thousands of years, various beliefs about insanity have existed, psychologist and philosopher Karl Jaspers was the first person who in his book 'general Psychopathology', written in 1917, outlined three major criteria for declaring a belief as illusion
 ye maandand hai: These criteria still apply to modern diagnoses of psychiatry today
 abhi haal hi main prakashit 'diaganaustic and statistical manual of mental disorders' main di gayi bhram kii paribhaasha kuch aisi he: However, there is a dispute over the definition that 'it takes place beyond the belief of everyone else' implies that if a person believes an assumption which most of the others do not believe, then that person is in the grip of a misleading idea
 
 iske alaava, yah vidambana hi he ki, uparokt teen mandandon kaa shrey jaspers ko diya jaataa he, par unka khud kaa kahana he ki ve maandand 'aspasht' or keval 'bahya-rupi' hai
 He has also written that, since the real or "internal" criterion of delusion can be known from the primary experience of delusion and the change in personality, the illusion, despite the illusion, can be correct about the subject: as - World War is taking place
 ' Delusions are categorized into two classes, absurd or argumentative and mood-conforming or mood-neutral
 in vargikarnon ke alaava, bhram akasar susangat vishay ke anuroop hote hai
 Although confusion can occur in any subject, there are some topics on which it is common to have confusion
 aam taur par hone vaale bhramon ke vishay hai: The modern definition and the basic criteria of Jaspers have been criticized, as unfavorable examples of every defined situation can also be found
 maansik taur par aswasth rogiyon par kiye adhyayan se pataa chalata he ki samay ke saath-saath bhramon kii tivrata or vishwaas kii dridhtaa main her-fer hone lagata he jisase yah sanket miltaa he ki ye zaruri nahin he ki nischitata or sudhaarney main asambhavata, ye donon bhramit karne vaali dharanaon ke ghatak hon
 It is not necessary that the illusion is a misnomer or a 'miscalculation of external truth'
 Some religious and spiritual beliefs cannot be denied because of their naturalness and hence they cannot be called untrue or even false, whether the person who believes in these beliefs is a victim of confusion or not
 baaki paristhitiyon main bhram ek sachcha vishwaas ho saktaa he
 For example, the illusion of jealousy, in which the confused person believes that their spouse is unfaithful to them or has been, as a result, the loyal and unhappy spouse due to the constant and unreasonable stress exerted by their confused partner
 It can take off if done
 aise maamle main jab aage chalakar baat sach nikalati he to bhram, bhram nahin rah jaataa
 In other cases, doctors or psychiatrists investigating delusions may misunderstand the delusion, because they think such an absurd or superfluous belief is impossible
 manochikitsakon ke paas na to itnaa samay hota he na hi saadhan ki ve bhramit vyakti kii baton kii satyata kii jaanch-parakh kar saken ki kahin galati se asli vishwaas ko bhram kaa rup na diya gaya ho

 R
 Critics such as D
 Laying said that the diagnosis of delusions by such definitions is based on the subjective understanding of the psychiatrist and that the psychiatrist may not have all the information from which the illusion can be interpreted
 R
 D
 Laying's hypothesis has been applied in some forms of projective medicine to "confine" the illusion system so strongly that the patient cannot make any changes to it
 Researchers at Yale University, Ohio State University and the Community Mental Health Center of Middle Georgia have used psychiatrists as novels and films

 Phillip Jose Farmer, author of science fiction fiction and Yale psychiatrist A
 James Giannini created a joint plan that used fictional storytelling to reduce confusion

 The fictional scenes of this novel discuss other novels of author Farmer and his characters are symbolically added to the illusion of fictional patients
 uske baad, is vishesh upanyaas kaa prayog asli jivan ke chikitsiya halaaton main kiya gaya
 Another difficulty in diagnosing delusions is that almost all symptoms of delusions are found in "normal" beliefs
 anek dharmik vishwaason main bhi bilkul yahi lakshan paae jate hai, phir bhi unhen sarvatra bhram nahin mana jaataa
 inhen sab kaarnon se manochikitsak anthony david ne tippanee kii ki "bhram kii koi sweekaarya yogya paribhaasha nahin he
 "psychiatrists consider a belief to be an illusion when the belief is absolutely absurd and that the patient is distressed, or the patient is overly anxious, especially when the patient, despite presenting contrary evidence or reasonable reasoning, Stays on his faith 'bhramon kii utpatti' ke do pramukh kaaran hai: Symptoms of 'disturbances in the functioning of the brain' are seen as the amount of dopamine increases
 manstapi sanglakshan par kiye ek praathmik adhyayan main is baat kii jaanch kii gayi ki amuk bhramon ko banaae rakhane ke liye dopamine kaa adhik maatra main hona aavashyak he, darasal yah adhyayan is baat ke spashtikaran ke liye kiya gaya tha ki kya manobhaajan main dopamine manovikruti paayi jaati he
 Results were found to be positive - varying amounts of dopamine metabolite HVA were found in delusions of heartburn and delirium
 in parinaamon ko keval kaamchalaoo mana ja saktaa he, chunki adhyayan main or zyaada jansankhya ko lekar, bhavishya main ek baar phir anusandhan karne kii maang thi
 It would be a one-sided thing to say that a certain amount of dopamine can cause a person to suffer from some specific confusion
 adhyayanon main paaya gaya he ki bhram kaa shikaar hone main vyakti kii umr or ling kaaphi prabhavakaari hote hai or kuch sanlakshanon ke jivan kaal main echvie ke str main fer-badlaav hone kii sambhaavna hoti he
 Regarding the effect of personality, it has been said, "jaspers believed that the disease causes a slight change in personality and that such a change leads to the creation of a confusing environment in which confusion begins to develop
" " Cultural components are "decisively influential in the representation of illusions"
 udhaaharan ke taur par, austria jaise isai, paashchaatya desh ke logon main aksar apradhi hone or sazaa paane ke bhram paae jate hai, lekin pakistan main - jahaan aparaadh kii sambhaavna adhik he, vahaan koi bhram nahin paaya jaataa
